Welcome back to this special edition of Criminals Unmasked. I'm your host, Walusimbe Josh. Eighteen months ago today, a family of eight in Mutundwe was brutally murdered. Two days later, another family of four, totally unrelated in Natete, was also killed in a similarly brutal manner. What seemed like two random acts of violence at the time would later turn out to be only the beginning of one of, if not the worst, serial killings we've ever seen in this country. The killer, who the media has nicknamed "The Cigarette Butt Killer," is ruthless and appears to have no motive. He doesn't take anything from his victims but he's been known to always leave a few things behind. A cigarette filter next to the bodies is usually in the blood of the victims. But what stands out the most is the fact that he has always left a witness. A single person he always leaves untouched. We have 14 witnesses now, and we're still no closer to figuring out his true identity. Now, to help us get into the mind of this, I want to say animal, but even animals kill for food. Today I'm joined by criminal psychologist, Professor Mahmoud Sali. Professor, you're welcome. Thank you for having me. Please give us a brief introduction of who you are and what you do. Well I am a neuroscientist, a professor at Makerere University and also the author of The Happy Place. Over the past 20 to 23 years, I've been studying human behavior on the basis of genes, - MOM - Neuroreceptors, dopamine, you know, good stuff like that. Great, great. So now, about the question that's on everyone's lips. Why? Why could he be doing this? What could be the motive? A scorpion is trying to cross a river. Is this a... It is a parable. A scorpion is trying to cross a river. So, he comes across a frog on the same side of the river as he is. And he turns to the frog and asks, "Could you help me and give me a ride across the river?" Now, the frog being the careful creature that he is, turns to the scorpion and tells him, "I would have given you a ride across the river but I can't because you're a scorpion. You might sting me and I die." The scorpion is surprised by this answer and he tells him, "But why would I want to sting you when I'm having a ride on your back? That would mean we would both drown and die. It doesn't make any sense to me." The frog thought about it and saw the sense in it. So, he tells him, "Jump onto my back and I give you ride across the river." And they set off on their journey very peacefully. But halfway across the river, the scorpion goes berserk, crazy. He stings the frog. Shocked, dying, the frog turns, looks at the scorpion and says, "Why?" "Scorpion, why have you stung me? Now, we're both going to die." The scorpion says, "It's in my nature. I sting. That's what I do." So why am I telling you this story? Sometimes, there just isn't a "why." Especially when you look at this case where the victims are not connected. Without this interconnection of victims… Are you okay? Yeah. I'm good. Are you, um, are you going to the city? Yeah. That's where I'm going. I need a ride to the city. Are you, are you alone? Yeah, I'm alone. Okay, then. Do you mind pulling up your shirt for me and doing a 360? Sorry, a what? Why? Guns, knives. You know there's a maniac out here, right? Yeah. I'm simply making sure you're not one of the bad guys. Plus, I'm a policeman. Oh. Okay. Okay, that's enough. That's a cool bag, by the way. I have one just like that. Thanks. The bag? - Mm-hmm. - Okay. Just, like, some jackets, and some boxers... Okay, that's enough. That's okay. As long as you don't seat here with it, we're okay. - Put it in the back and come in. - Okay. Uh. Don't worry about him. He's okay. So, why is he… why is he cuffed up? Is he, like, dangerous? Does he look dangerous to you? It's just precaution. Standard procedure. Trust me. If you were seating behind me, I'd probably have to cuff you up as well. Come on, get in. Pull it. No, not the latch. You… Pull it. Pull. I think it's about time I got that fixed. …by now. I have a book with me right here, and it's titled, The Happy Place. ‪ Professor Sali tells us that his book will be… What's with… I'm sorry. Yeah, Bob. I'm good. How are you? No, no, no. That's not true. No, that's not true. Maybe you should just speak to the captain. ‪ He said I should just pick up the witness from there. And that's exactly what I've done. 'Cause I'm on the way. Why don't you send a few uniformed guys? They'll be more happy to do it. He didn't have an ID on him. And he's not talking, so… I sent you a picture of him on your Whatsapp. Why would I send you a picture of his feet? Of course, I sent you a picture of his face. You know I'm supposed to be on leave, eh? Come on. Um, why don't you… I'll be there may be in an hour or so. No problem. Tsk. Sorry about that. No, it's okay. - May I please borrow… - Sure, sure. I just need to let my mom know I'm okay. It's okay. Ah, it's locked. - Zero, one, - Zero, one, - zero, six, - zero, six, - zero, nine. - Zero, nine. - Zero-one-zero… - Zero-one-zero-six-zero-nine. Okay, thanks. Mom? Yes, uh… It's Jim. Jim, yes. Yeah, I'm alright. I don't have phone on me now. I'm using a friend's number, yeah. Mom. Can you hear me? Can you hear me. Yes, I was saying that I don't have my phone on me now. I've, uh… Just borrowed this one from a friend. Mom, did you remember to take your pills? And yesterday? No, I didn't forget to call. I just had a... Hello? Hello? Mom. Hello? Hello? I think it's the network. Thank you very much. So, Jim. Is that, like, short for Jimmy? Uh, no. It's just Jim. You know, like the comedian, Jim Carrey. Jim Carrey? I've never heard of him. Is he famous? Yeah. Very famous. Starred in a couple of really funny films in the 90s, you know. The Ace Ventura, The Mask, Bruce Almighty. He's a funny guy. Hey, is… Is he some kind of criminal? Who? Jim Carrey? No, no, I, I mean him. I highly doubt that. That one doesn't work. It doesn't work. Do you need a wipe or something? I have a bandage. Yeah. That would be great. What the hell happened to you? Uh, it's a… It's a long story, bro. I love stories, and we have time. Do you know the expression, "No good deed goes unpunished?" Yes, I've… I've heard of it. Okay. So would you say that me picking you up there was a good deed on my part? Yeah, it was… it was a very good thing and may the good Lord bless you very much for it. Alright. Let me tell you a story. When I was about eight, I had a friend of mine called Suzan. You remember that show, Different Strokes? It's like an '80s TV show. Uh, yeah. It had that black kid, what was his name? - Arnold. - Uh, Arnold… - Arnold Jackson, yes! - Arnold Jackson, yes. She looked exactly like Arnold Jackson. She was two years younger than me but… She looked five years older. So, my kid brother and I would play bladda with her because she was, like, the only kid in the neighborhood in our age bracket. You don't know bladda, do you? No. Let me explain it to you. Bladda was a popular game in East Africa in the early '90s. No one knows who invented it but it was popularized by Elizabeth Naggayi. And just like Single Dutch, you needed a minimum of three players. Two players stood in front of each other. They tied a rope around their ankles. One player, or players would stand in front of the rope and took turns jumping inside of the rope. The object of the game is not to land on the rope. If you landed on the rope, then you took the turns of the people who were holding the rope. If you jumped through, they raise the rope, and they continue raising the rope. And if you got through if they raise the rope as high as as high as the armpit, then you'd go to a single leg. ‪So the two players on the end put the rope around one leg and you jump through the rope without landing on it. Unfortunately today, you won't find anyone playing this game anymore because it's not in a downloadable app. So, Suzan's dad used to work at Posta Uganda, which was a good job at the time. - Yeah. - However, when Suzan's dad died, Suzan and her mother had to move to our neighbourhood. She was probably the only person in the whole district with a telephone. And this is the '80s, okay? Even like the rich people, they had to book in advance to use the telephone, as you can imagine. And needless to say, her one-bedroom house was like a tourist attraction. People would come in all the time to use the telephone and some, some people, even just to see the phone. So, New Year's Eve 1988, it was raining heavily, thunder and everything. It was crazy outside. An old lady, about 60 years or something, soaking wet. She comes through the neighbourhood knocking on doors. I assumed she was looking for shelter. And I was the only person in the house who was awake, I didn't open, obviously. But I watched. Through the window, I watched and I saw her moving house to house. So, she ended up at Mama Suzan's house. As you can imagine, most people are only going to open for a stranger if it benefits them in one way or another. So, many neighbors were hesitant to open the doors. So, she moved all the way to Mama Suzan's house. That morning, we woke up to a crime scene. Four people had been murdered during the down pour. One person was strangled, the other three stabbed to death. Mama Suzan's house was empty. You see the thieves, they used the noise of the rain to mask out their activities, and almost emptied out half the neighbourhood. Woah. And the old lady? The old lady was part of it. She was part of the whole thing like bait. Wow. Maybe Mama Suzan thought that she wanted to use the telephone, I don't know. But she opened for the sweet old lady and she got bit for it. Criminals tend to use an innocent façade to get people to open their doors. Mama Suzan opened the door and she paid with her life. The moral of the story is, "Sometimes, the good thing is not always the right thing to do." - In this case, you. - Yeah? Me? What, what, what about me? Do you mind if I smoke? Oh shit, I forgot my cigarettes. So, we have this Cigarette-Butt Killer going around killing people. And then, there's you. An innocent-looking young man with what looks like after-fight injuries. Now, I don't know what Mama Suzan would make of this, but I have a theory. So, are you saying I'm pretending to be someone that I'm not? Like... It's not what I said. I'm just saying you're being very uptight with your story. Maybe you'd prefer we go with my theory? Dude look, I, I am not a criminal, okay? What I am is um… what, a very unlucky guy. 'Cause my life for the past two days has been, for lack of a better word, crazy. Honestly. Lucky people don't usually realize that they're lucky until it's too late. You, for example. You probably were better off a week ago. But it took today for you to realize that. But now today has arrived, it's too late for you to have what you had two days ago. So, you still think your story's too long, or would you prefer we go with my theory? Just In case my shiny badge was not shiny enough. Okay. Here's what happened. Last week Wednesday, when was it? Tuesday or Wednesday? It was Wednesday. I was in my apartment trying to finish up some some drawings for work. You see, I'm a cartoonist for Kampala Weekly and we do these really crazy, interesting characters. Okay. Yea. So, anyways, I think someone got in drugged me up or something 'cause I woke up in some building, some random building tied up to a chair, you know like, like in the movies. Sorry. ‪Hmm. ‪ ‪ ‪ VICKY SIS Yeah? No, I'm almost done. Just give me a few more minutes. Yeah, keep it running. Oh, and don't roll down the windows. Too much dust here. Cool. ‪- ‪- Why are you doing this? Yeah? I'm coming out right now. No, I can bring him myself. Don't worry about it. Thanks. Not so funny now, is it? Funny boy! Hold up, hold up. Let me get this straight. Yeah. You're telling me, - you got abducted by two girls, - Yes. - Who tortured you. - Uh-huh. ‪All because of a drawing? Yes. A drawing of Jesus Christ? Is this your story? I swear on my mom's soul, it happened. All of it. I'm not saying it didn't happen. I'm just saying this is, what's the word? It's odd. - Yea. Odd yea. - 'Cause these things don't happen in Uganda. I know. But let's say it did happen. - The drawing… - Yeah? What was it about? Well, Jesus kicking the bucket. Of course, it was. So, I take it these two girls were Christians? Hmm. Possibly. Or are you saying they were Muslims. 'Cause, ‪I mean, ‪don't the Muslims have their own guy? I don't know. Maybe, maybe not. I never got the chance to ask. - She was not like dressed in some… - Hijab. Yeah, it's a hijab. Well, it's about time. How do you mean? It's about time that Christians became extreme again. Like, what do you mean, "again"? "Extreme" again? Christians are friendly now. But there was a time when Christians were really, really extreme. Do you think the colonialists came to Africa, took our land, gave us books, and everybody just jumped into the holy quest, just singing and dancing kumbaya? Hell, no. They were beaten into submission. You either believe, or you die. So yeah. If that is not extreme, then I don't know what is. So yeah, maybe it's about time. So…what was the joke? Uh… It's really not that funny, man. You tell me the joke and I'll tell you if it's funny or not. Old man, are you ok? Carry on. Er, okay. Um, so the setup is, someone is holding a picture of Jesus. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. And his friend… Sorry, just a minute… Ouch. And his friend asks him, "Tom." You know, I like giving my characters relatable names. So Tom asks him, "What did Jesus say to his wife, before kicking the bucket?" Jesus had a wife? It doesn't matter. Let's assume it's an alternate universe. That's just how the joke is. Okay. Fine, fine. Then what did Jesus say… to his wife? He asked her to push the bucket a little to the left, and take out the fish. I don't get it. Well, you know the expression, "kicking the bucket"? I know it. - Yeah, like, it means dying. - I know. Well, it's like a play on words, you know, like… In this case, the joke is in the double meaning. Jesus kicks an actual bucket, like, like a football. And she had to take out the fish. - No? - Nope. - Okay. - Yeah. Ii have to do one every week so… Sometimes I run out of ideas. Maybe you should subscribe to a writer's class. I actually have two degrees, so… - What? - I was in med school for six months. But that's not the point. The point really here is, - the joke wasn't that offensive. - Ha! Clearly, someone thought it was. - Well, they were wrong. - Oh, shit! What? Woah, woah. Ah. Not on my seats. What's up with him? I think he got car sick or something. No, I mean before all this. What happened to him before all this? Do you know the Cigarette-Butt Killer guy? - Wait, is that him? - No, no, no. He's probably just one of the witnesses. Wait. What have you heard? Well, I've heard on the news that he usually targets families and burns them with cigarette butts on their behinds. Some crazy propaganda like that. And wipes out all evidence. Wait. That's one of them witnesses from the cigarette thing you talked about? You know, when you said, witness, I didn't actually think you meant witness. It's crazy. Very exciting. Yeah. People dying is very exciting, isn't it? Well, I didn't mean it like that. Old man! Are you okay? Chief, are you fine? What's his name? I don't know. But why do you think they call him the "Cigarette-Butt Killer"? No, the other serial killer guy. The clue is in the name. Come give me a hand. I'm useless. My hands. Sorry. Let's go. Is that a fanny pack? I haven't seen those in minute, man. Listen. The next time you want to vomit… …please use this, okay? Please. Now, I'm only going to cuff one of your hands. It is the tragic story of Akol Rachel. Now, to those of you who are just joining me, Rachel is the 12-year-old who died after having an abortion at home. The school doesn't know. The parents have no idea how any of that happened, and… You know what? I think this tire is almost flat. I think we'll be ok. Isn't this the guy that got shot in the leg? No. That was Bebe Cool. This is Bobi Wine. - Oh. - Yeah. You don't know who Bobi Wine is? Are you sure you're a policeman, you guy? Wow. I heard he got shot in the kneecap. In the kneecap or the thigh? I heard it was the kneecap. Apparently, the bullet ricocheted off or something. Like sort of, bounced off. You know. - Crazy stuff like that. - Who told you this? It was in the papers. I mean… Good. Do you know what it means for a knee to be shot out by a 9mm hollow point? Everything! And by everything, I don't mean anything good. Getting shot in the knee, or kneecapping as its commonly known, is a nasty way of inflicting pain and damage on a human body. It's so painful that there aren't many English words to describe the level of pain that is associated with it. In Uganda, we have a word. It's called, okuyinga. The knee joint is a bundle of bone, cartilage, muscle fibers and nerve bundles. And because it has the whole package, a projectile that penetrates the joint has the opportunity to damage all these, creating crushing cavitation and laceration injuries. It's the presence of so much bone that leads to the most immediate pain. Even with a small caliber gun, like the one Patrick has, being shot on the knee can have lifelong effects. Bullets are made of lead. The synovial fluid that provides cushioning for the knee joint dissolves lead. So if you have lead lodged into your knee, it will cause chronic lead poisoning, which might eventually lead to hypertrophy arthritis, a severe form of the degenerative disease. So let's say it did happen that way, this friend of yours. - He's not my friend. - Okay. He'd be looking at a lifetime of lead poisoning, which is not something you can call fun. Judging by the way they jump high on stage my bet is, it was only a flesh wound. Probably a through and through. Either way, you do not want to get shot in the knee. Because that's like a really, really painful place to be shot. Speaking of pain, how did you escape the religious girls? I didn't escape per se, you know. She… They took me to some different location, some… Some pine tree forest or something. Some weird place. ‪ Shut up. Ah! Fuck! Shit! You're making a big mistake, you know that? Because if… Because if you had any brains in that excuse of a head of yours, then, you'd kill me right now. I am killing you. You'll die. Yeah? But then why am I still alive? Huh? - Why am I still... - You'll die from being buried. Yeah, you see, that's the problem. I don't know what you think… But I'm getting out of this hole. Guaranteed. Last chance. Last chance. I'm getting out. Last chance or I'm getting out. Okay, why are we stopping? It's something that idiot said. What did he say? It's really not about what he said. It's how he said it. Hmm. You don't really think he could come out of that hole, do you? ‪ - Wow. - Yeah. Jesus Christ. What the hell is going on in this country? I know, dude. It's crazy, right? It's, like, ridiculous. Would you recognize their faces, these girls that abducted you, would you recognize their faces if you saw them again? Well… one of them is dead now but, but yeah. I remember the one that got away though, you know, she she had these really tiny eyes. She kinda looks like Brenda Fassie, okay? - Then I guess we should go to the station. - Station? Yeah. You need to make a statement. We have this really good sketch artist. All you have to do is describe the people you saw and at least he can give us something to start with. Does it have to be today? I mean, I don't mind coming in on any other day, you know. I can come in on, let's say Tuesday, after I've rested. No, it has to be now while the memory is still fresh in your head. I promise it won't take too long. Plus, I'll personally drive you myself to your house. Where did you say you live? Ntinda. Just before Tuskys. But right now, I'm going to my mom's and that's all the way in Makindye, so… Ooh. That's some good fish. Oh yeah, some great fish. Hello madam, I hope I get a discount this time… Hmm. Put it there. Give him this. ‪ - Is this religious? - No, it's not. It's just something I picked up. Is it, like, evidence? Ah, of course not. I just thought it looked beautiful, so I took it, and it was way out of the crime scene. I like to call it my lucky charm. Okay? Old man, I'm going to fix your cuffs. They don't look very comfortable. The drinks went high by 200 shillings. Would you want me to clean your windscreen? - No, it's okay. - It's free. Can I have it? Thank you. You are good to go. Vicky! Wait, slow down. Slow down. What's going on? What? Right now? Okay, let me come over. Okay sir. Is everything okay? That's my girlfriend's sister. Something must have gone wrong. She wants me to go home now. But is she fine or…? I don't know, my… my girlfriend is pregnant and we've had some miscarriages in the past so… I'm really hoping that's not the case. I'm going to have to rush there, but let me drop you at the police station. When you get there, you ask for someone called Bob. You tell him that Patrick brought you and sent you. So, you can get a sketch for the girls, the abductors, the religious girls. I'm sorry but I really, really have to go, okay? Okay. You see the signpost there? The blue one with the goon, with the white words on it? - The restaurant? - No. That is purple. The blue one with the white words on it. Hmm? Oh yeah, yeah. I've seen it. Yeah. Opposite it there's a red truck, a fire truck. - Mm-hmm. - But right opposite it, there's a police station. I want you to go there. Ask for Bob. Tell him that Patrick sent you. He'll get you a sketch artist and when he's done, I'll come pick you up after that, okay? - I… I don't know, bro. - I really, really have to go. I'm sorry but I really have to go. Okay, what about him? I'm sure he doesn't mind. Do you mind? I guess he doesn't. Okay. Ouch! Thanks. - Blue with the white words on it. - Yeah. ‪-Opposite the truck. Okay. ‪-Yeah. My bag! My bag! I forgot my bag. You know, on second thought, get in. I think it's irresponsible of me to leave you here. You just confessed to a murder. Come, let's first go to my house, and then from there we go to the station. Get inside, let's go. And that murder thing, is self-defense in the eyes of the law. Of course. Come on everyone knows it's self defense. Patrick! Patrick! Hey, um, sorry to bother you but can I use your bathroom? Please? Okay. No problem. Thanks. - Actually, you know what? - Yep? - Bring me that fish. - The what? I've never really understood the whole fish-on- the-grill thing, man. Like, what's that about? Well, you don't want a smelly fish in your car. Plus, it helps keep the fish fresh This is why you need to read this book, A Happy Place, because it takes you to that place where you get to discover your inner self. Get to solve your many problems. Get to bring up your children in an upward manner, in a very - self-development word… - Bathroom. And please, use the brown towel. Okay! Gotcha. By the way, we don't flush number ones here. What have I done to myself? A gun? Now, where is Joseph? - I don't know. - Are you stupid? ‪No, listen. Listen. All I need to do, is to keenly tell me how she looks like. ‪Was he tall? ‪Was he short? Was he fat? I need to know! - I don't know. I have no idea. - Why didn't she call me? Why didn't you call the police? But then you should have called me. Where was Dorothy going with all this? - I don't know! - And you were in the same car? ‪-We had the same car. ‪-And you're… Fuck! Fuck! - Just… - I don't know! You two have my number, you should have called me. Let's go to the police. ‪-What? ‪-I need to know where he is. I don't know. I have no idea. I had to go and leave - because I heard a gunshot... - Possesing a gun is illegal! I decided to drive off because I saw him aiming the gun at me. That's the guy, Patrick. That's him. ‪ - Open the door. - You must break the door. ‪I just want to talk. Break the door! ‪ Do you think I'm stupid? Fuck you! No, Patrick. Don't do it. No, no. Not here. Why? Because death is too easy. Please. Trust me. When you see what he did to Dorothy, you'll understand why shooting him in the head is just too quick of a death for his ass. What was it you said about bullets and kneecaps? ‪Huh? Oh, I remember. You said they bounce off. Let's find out. I swear you should stop making that sound. Stop making that annoying sound! Shut the hell up or I swear to God, I will shoot you in your other knee. I swear, I will shoot you. I'll shoot you in your other arm as well. Basically, everything you have two of. Like your fucking face. Two-faced… Hmm. Who is he? Ah, shit! I forgot about him. Just some other guy from some case shit. ‪Hmm. Tsk. You and Dorothy? You're now kidnapping people, huh? Torturing people? You're becoming into religious avengers? What is going…? Who are you people? What do you mean, religious avengers? This had nothing to do with his religion. Is that what he told you? That's not true. Tsk, this guy. This motherfucker. You should not believe a single word that he says. - He's a fucking liar. - A fucking liar and a thief! Oh, I knew this. I knew this son of a bitch was lying from the minute I saw him. I knew! Tell me everything. He is the guy from the news stories. What news stories? You remember that teenage girl on the news? Akol something? Yeah, I think Dorothy told me about her. Is she the one that died in Mulago Hospital? What has she got to do with this? What Dorothy didn't tell you was that this pig is the one that sent her to the hospital. She came in with a botched abortion, of which, as you can imagine, had Dorothy and all the other nurses concerned. Dorothy then took on her case and really tried to save her life. But it was a little too late. At first, the girl didn't want to say anything. But right before she died, she got scared and told Dorothy what happened. He got her pregnant, tried performing an abortion on her. And I'm guessing it's because he didn't want her to go to the hospital. Because going to the hospital would mean people finding out that he was sleeping with a fucking 12-year-old girl. Do you know what he told her? He told her that he was a fucking part-time doctor. Yeah, he told me that shit, too. I did not believe a word he said. That he went to med school and everything. A fucking part-time doctor, my ass. So a child died, all because Mr. Pervert over here did not want anyone to find out that he was a pervert. But why didn't you guys just come to me? We were going to… eventually. You know Dorothy is not allowed to talk about her patients with anyone, including the police, by law. - Ah, fuck that! - Mm-hmm. It's some doctor-patient confidentiality thing. And you know how she is with her job. Her plan was to get him to confess on tape. And with that footage, she would then come to you. Did you actually see her die? - Who? Dorothy? - Dorothy. Did you see her die? No. I heard the shot and saw her on the ground. I don't know. Maybe she's still alive. Look, I really wanted to tell you everything about it, but everything happened so fast. When Dorothy picked me up on Wednesday, I didn't know what was happening until we got to his mom's house. That's where we found him. We found him under some bridge smoking. That is how we got him. Robin? Bruce? How about Steven? Bob? Luke? As in, Luke the Skywalker? Einstein? Leusas? You know they don't all have to be names of once famous people. Oh, and save Leusas for when your kid comes. I honestly don't want to give my kid a silly name, just because someone on a TV show had it. Now, Einstein... Now, what's wrong with Einstein? He was a smart guy, wasn't he? What's wrong with Einstein?! It's child abuse, Vee. That's what's wrong with it. Kid has to live up to that name or be the butt of every joke at school. I like the name Ludvik. Now, that's a cool name. I think it's nice to have a cool name with a little bit of history. It builds character. Climbing mountains builds character, not weird names. Well, let's agree to disagree. - Is the camera on? - Uh-huh. Alright, creep. You're going to look directly into that camera over there and tell the truth. If you lie, I'll shoot you in the testicles. Good luck shooting a target that small. Because… That means the hand injury was a lie. But then, how was burying him going to give you the confession you wanted? Huh? He told you we buried him alive? Motherfucker! I should have my head examined for believing anything this piece of shit guy had to say. Clearly. And Dorothy, where did she get the gun? - She told me she borrowed yours. - Mine was in the… That's a cool bag by the way, I have one just like that. Shit! ‪ Old man, are you okay? What happened? Yeah I'm okay but I just lost control of my car. But I'm alright. Do you have any cigarettes? - Old man, - Thank you. Those cigarettes will kill you. ENTER YOUR PIN Zero-one-six-zero-nine Hey, Patrick! Now, about that picture you sent earlier. Um, I wasn't able to find a match like right away. But then Rita, you know Rita from Accounts, eh? Yeah, she found it on my desk and asked me if that case was finally settled. So I asked her, "What case?" And then she went on and on about this case that we had worked on. You know the one where this old man's neighbors accused him of witchcraft and burned down his house with his daughter and granddaughter inside? Eh, that one. He actually came to the station a couple of times claiming the witchcraft thing was all a plot to kill him and take his land. But he had no way of proving that so… The case didn't go anywhere. Anyway, we just thought it was really strange that he's now a witness in this Cigarette-Butt Killer thing. It's like trouble just keeps finding this old man. Anyway, we'll ask him more questions when you guys get here. Are your parents around? Yes. Why? Brothers, let me work it out. Translated by HIVENTY
