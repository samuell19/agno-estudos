Thank you, Laszlo. I wish you'd learn to shake hands like an Englishman. Look, look what progress we are making. Yes, yes, well, excuse me, but I'm in involved. A bird in hand waits for no man. Leo, wait! You remember you promised. I'm asking you again, for the third time. Your father asked me. You remember, "noblesse oblige." I will, I will. So we can expect you at our next meeting, then?

And you welcome me... in-- into your... womb. Bosom. Bosom. (scattered chuckles) Friends, fellow humans, even though sexual passion may be gross and perverted, even though hunger strokes, man does not live by fear alone. Even though, now, not 50 yards from here, frozen turkeys defrost while hungry children look on... I love you all. The human race is not the sweetest. I love you, as I love people of all colors-- white, red, yellow, black-- especially black-- and all those mixtures of color on God's great palate. This earth, this superb isle-- This-- Eh, what did I tell you? What we need is a strong king! (all cheering) (speaking Italian) (singing in mixed languages) ** It's a beautiful song. I-I must translate it for you. "Lock away, oh, my mother, "all my fancy dresses, "all my colorful dresses, it's time for mourning." She meant national mourning, of course. "I can't wear them anymore. "The only color I can wear now is black, black, black." Oh, it's a beautiful song. ** (disconnected voices, male and female) Music from a father... Trying to connect you. Do I dare presume? Prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet. (laughter) To meet the faces that you meet. When I hear laughter, I hear the roar of the wild beast. Baudelaire, I think. (indistinct chatter) As Baudelaire said... (correcting) Baud-elaire. Baudelaire. Her face. Things fly apart. (overlapping chatter) To meet the faces... I still don't get it. Let me explain. (laughter) Oh, the universe! He can't remember. He can't remember his song. How the words go. How the words go. Can you make it better? Is there a verse after death? The universe! Rotten.

Do not go gently! Rage! Rage against the dying. The lying! The lying will connect you. Leo the last. (indistinct) (woman moaning) I'm-- I'm sorry. Excuse me. Guns? What's happened? Laszlo. Yes? What is this? They are arms, in case of emergency. Emergency? Yes. In case of revolution. What revolution? I am a pacifist! But...but...but... How dare you use my father's house for this! But you promised! I am a pacifist! Leo! Get out! I'm against violence! Get out! Violence shows us nothing! Get out! Get out of my house! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I love you, but I'll kill you! Get out! Peace! We must have peace! (Laszlo playing piano) ** Out! You, too, Laszlo! Out! Out! Out! Get out! (screaming, chattering) That's very strange. Darling, do you remember seeing a hole there? No, no, darling. With heads popping up out of it? Darling, you are dreaming. There were-- Come on, come on. Oh, darling, I ache for you. I ache for-- I love you. I love you. Darling, you know that I love you... but... though I love myself. I love the world. At least I love the people in it, but only at long range. You see, the closer I get, the further away I feel. (disconnected voices, in turn) He feels nothing. Nothing. He can't remember his song. Very strange. All you possess. His song. His song. All you possess. He feels nothing. Do not go gently. Nothing at all. Can't remember. Possess. Can't remember his song. All you possess. (water dripping) Can I help you, sir? Oh, it is you. Careful, I'm very angry! But I want to help you, sir. No more meetings here! Do you understand? Gather your possessions and go! (gasps) But where? Where shall I go, sir? I don't care! It's too late! Stop! This is also a bomb? History repeats itself. Give it to me. No. Give it to me. I won't. Give it to me! No! Give it to me, please. Leo, please, give it to me. I will give you anything you want, but give me the sugar bowl! No! He killed himself with this. This what? Who? One of my ancestors. Huh? With this. He couldn't bear the shame of defeat... (blows) ...of failure. He unscrewed this from the top. He put it into a gun. (imitates ramrod) And, Santa Madonna... click! And he was dead. With a strawberry? With a silver strawberry. Perfect, beautiful. Isn't it? Sir, I'm terribly sorry I let you down. I'm going to get rid of all this. I don't want you to be arrested. Uh, well, you are forgiven now, Laszlo. But uh-- (police siren approaching) What is this? Good God, police! Police. Are you scared? Scared to defend my home? Ah-ah! Keep calm, Laszlo. (siren passes, fades) I'll try. Mm-hmm. First, we'll have a look. Surreptitiously? Exactly, to see-- or not to be near the scene. Are they throwing out the call then? I think so. ** (Laszlo) Oh, no, Leo, we are saved. It's someone in that house that they're after. (woman laughing) (Leo) Ah, this man Kowalski-- there was a fight yesterday. Perhaps... (woman, singing) * If you've come to meet me * * Just gimme lots of ground * (singing indistinct in the street chatter) Run, Roscoe, run! The fuzz! Run! (Leo) Ah, it's Roscoe they want. (Laszlo) You know the names of these people? (Leo) Well... (Laszlo) What now? (Leo) I don't know. Wait. (singing woman now laughing) (Leo) The police are with Salambo. Ah, I know this man! This is a hero, a real friend of the people. (crowd cheering) Oh, no! (crowd continues cheering) (Laszlo) He has a certain style. (Leo chuckles) (Leo) Oh, ha ha! This girl! Give it to me! (cheering) Look at this! Look at this! (Laszlo) You see, the police are no fools. They have seen him! Look out, Roscoe! (car horn honking) (Leo) Where is he? Where is he? (Laszlo) Ooh, the police are on the roof! (woman) Where did he go? (Leo) But the bird has flown. (Laszlo) There! There he is! He's too quick for them. He's free. (Leo) Ah, I'm afraid not! Reinforcements are at hand. (Laszlo) Look. Huh. (woman) Look out, Roscoe! Run, Roscoe! Run! (crowd shouting) (Leo) Oh, what panache! (Laszlo) Look! This is his silver strawberry. But he's innocent! He's guilty! (Leo) He's innocent! (crowd shouting) (woman singing indistinctly) ** (singing woman now laughing) (siren blaring) Roscoe! All right, all right. I'll take care of you now. He didn't do nothing! He didn't do nothing! (Laszlo) Feel the water caressing you, slowly, up and down, and up and down. Now, slowly, slowly. Feel your fingertips together. The freedom will come from your fingertips. Touch your faces. Touch your faces with your fingertips. Like this. Touch your faces. Sense your skin. Touch your hair. Touch your hair. Feel the fingertips on your hair. Feel the sensation flowing from your fingertips into your hair. 'Round your body, free, and touch your fingertips together. Hands up! Let your fingertips touch each other, and the freedom flow from one to the other. You want to share your freedom with your neighbor. Turn to your neighbor. Touch your neighbor's face with your fingertips. The feeling is flowing from your neighbor's fingertips and back to yourselves. Touch your neighbor's face, touch his hair, touch her hair. Touch with your fingertips, and touch your fingertips together. Your fingertips together, freedom flowing, one to the other. Freedom flowing. And now you're beginning to feel that freedom in your own conscious. Feel that freedom. (chanting) You have shed your clothes. Now shed your inhibitions, your guilt. Awaken those dead feelings. Let them float to the surface. Let them fly up. Now, say what you feel. What do you feel? Reborn. And what do you feel? Liberated! I feel alive! And what do you feel? I feel happy, happy! I feel wonderful! And what do you feel? I feel wet. I feel embarrassed. Now, total immersion. Down, up, down... up... down... up... down... up. I feel nothing. Down. Communicate with the water. Up. I feel nothing. Down. Let it engulf you. Up. But I feel nothing. Down. Discover the now. Up. Down. Massage the emotions. Up. I feel nothing. Now, drifting, drifting. Undulate, drift, undulate. The freedom is undulating through you. You are beginning now to feel free. Drift, drift. Your being is caressing the moment, the now. Drift and undulate. Your door is open. Release, respond, drift, and undulate. You know I love you? Yes, I know you do, Leo. But you are disturbed, my darling. Just relax and tell me all about it. You are ready now to express all your freedom spontaneously. Arouse those dead feelings, those dead responses. You're growing freer. Is it the national crisis? Is it the world crisis? No. Hmm? Now, just relax and tell me. I saw a man unfairly arrested yesterday. (Laszlo) Soft and smooth. He filled my eyes with light. Without him, his family will collapse. (Laszlo) Undulate. He is black. Police brutality. (Laszlo) And undulate, drift... I feel I should help. (Laszlo) Softly, drift... I-- I feel I should help. (Laszlo) Good, Leo. I feel I should help! Good. Bobbing up and down again! Up and down... I feel I must help! Oh, Leo! I feel! Feel! I feel! Oh, my darling! I feel! Oh, you saved him! I feel! I feel! I feel! You are released! Open your souls, open your breasts! I feel!

Now, now, Hilda. It's too early for tears. Only rehearsing. (pastor) Perhaps, if everyone is ready, this time we can get it right. It's all right. (Pastor) Where's the music? Aren't you ready yet? Of course I'm ready. (woman) Well, there are enough of you. I'll waive my hand once for the organ, twice for the door. Right. We're not going all the way back. All right, we'll do it from here. There you are. There's no use walking as quickly as this. They'll never get the right timing. Very well. (organ begins) (whispering inaudibly) Stop! (organ music stops) I must confess! Yesterday, I killed a man! Leo! With kindness. I killed a man with kindness. What are you talking about? For God's sake! Begging your pardon, Padre. For goodness sake, Leo, shut up! Carry on everyone, Back to the starting tapes. Bitte, Leo. Continue, Mr. Fortisso- No, I can't go on! I can't. Margaret... Margaret, I'm sorry. It's my fault. Forgive me. I saw him die. Leo! Father, he's unwell. Allow me to be the judge of that. I'm his doctor. Leo, pull yourself together, man! I know him better than you do. I know his soul. His soul? You vain, self-centered romantic. Look at her, Leo. She's a fine figure of a woman. With my body, I thee worship. Isn't that right, Padre? Don't, don't-- Leo, Leo! Come-- come here! (Margaret) Leo, how dare you! Come back, you poof! Faggot! (Margaret) This is so humiliating. I've never been so humiliated in my life! Leo! Now, now, now, now, let me handle this, Max. Let me handle this. Calmly, Leo, calmly. Undulate, undulate. Feel the calm in your fingertips. That's right, undulate, undulate. Tips of your fingers together, bobbing up and down. Begin. Up and down, and up and down, and up and down, and up and down-- Calmly, Leo. Nothing to worry about. Undulate. It's all right. No need for you to be like that. Come on, Leo. Come on!

You know brother Mardi has run his race. You know brother Mardi has finished his course, and now he's comin' on home. Now he's comin' on home. (all) Yeah! Lord, you saw our brother in the heat of the day, tied against the forces that would chain him to poverty. (congregation exclaiming throughout) All of it against the repressiveness and oppressiveness of our society. This evil society. (all) Yeah! You have heard him in the midnight hour, wonderin' when a change is gonna come. Moanin' and groanin', and sometimes with tears rollin' down the sides of his face. You heard him say, "I'm holdin' on.

The same, I suppose... to serve you, sir. You're not going to throw me out. You can't live without me, sir. You think so? I know it, sir. (Laszlo) Leo, do you remember what your mother used to play?

Let's go on and get there first. Come on, baby, come on. Come on, Salambo. (overlapping chatter) Brandy, please. What you drinkin', baby? All right, all right. Let's get some-- Hey, baby. Thank you, sir. Three bob, please. What are you drinkin', baby? Come on. (man) Have you made up your mind yet? (indistinct chatter) (man) All right, all right, let's go. What are you drinkin' over there, baby? ** (laughter, shouts) Uh-uh! Go on, get it, man. Get out of it. Push him. Push him outta there. (cheers, laughter) Hey, come here, man. All right. (cheers, laughter) Go on. (laughter) All right. (overlapping chatter) What? Too much money. Aw, man. That's a small price to pay. And she's as fresh as a field of daisies. (wild laughter) No, stop! (room goes quiet) (man) What are you doing, man? Hey, watch it, man! Let me go. You want a girl? Yes, I do. Cool it. Come away from this place. Come here, baby. Come on, baby. Thank you, no. I want this girl. You gotta be polite, then. (laughing) You gotta be cool, man. Want a girl? Yes. You have some bread, right? All right. Cool. Come here, baby. Swing, baby. (man) Hands across the sea! Hey, what about me? Shit! (man) Let's have them skins, man. Come on, I'm going to take you home. Well, I've got my own place I usually take guys to. You've never done this before. Are you afraid? Please don't go through with this. Ah, you'll soon change your mind. What's the matter, don't you like niggers? (gasps) I am sorry. It's just that I find this work particularly offensive. What are you after? I'm going to stop you from leading this life. Christ, the Lord! Busted on me first time out. Oh... Please. What about Roscoe? Huh? Think of your father! Leave me alone! Forgive me. Jasper! Forgive me. Jasper! Leave me alone! Forgiv-- (speaking foreign language) Mama? (trembling) Mama? (both speaking foreign language) (knocking) Madam, I'm going to help your daughter. Go on, clear off. Go on. I want to look after your sister. Tell him we don't want any help. Make him go. She says she doesn't want any help. Please, madam. Tell her, please. Leave us alone. Leave us alone! Oh, mama! (knock on door) I was discreetly peeping in, waiting for you to break the ice. (child crying) Hello, everybody. I am this little lady's representative, and I have a power of attorney over her and all you survey. I am like you, a true friend of the people. (child cries) Sweet, aren't they? Very old African custom, the highest form of greeting. (speaking foreign language) She says what a great honor you have bestowed on her house. By taking her daughter... to be your concubine. Concubine? She didn't say that. This girl will be my ward. Madam, I live nearby. That is my home. Oh, anything you say, sir. Of course, you realize, there must be a slight charge. What? Oh, don't think of me, think of her family, her aged mother. (speaking foreign language) (child crying) Just a small down payment on the merchandise. It's in mint condition. 24 months to pay. How dare you. I will give this lady some money, flesh peddler! Please, madam, take it. Please. Don't worry. You can rely on me. Come on. Where we goin'? (Leo) To a better life. (both indistinct) Tomorrow we'll get you some new clothes and start your studies. (gasps) Hey, who's the old woman? Oh, Nanny. This is Salambo. Nanny will look after you. Did he buy you, too? Oh, this is too much. I'm leaving! Oh, now, don't go. Don't go, please. Don't mind me, will you? What is Margaret going to say? Now, don't be silly. We are going to care for her. First thing in the morning, I go to Margaret and tell her. Ah, yeah. And, remember, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's maid servant! (gasps) It's her or me! (Salambo laughs) Hilda! (Salambo singing) ** (door opens down hallway) (Salambo) Anybody awake in this house? (door closes) (footsteps) Is there anybody awake in this house? Is there anybody there? (knock on door) Are you still awake? Protect me, oh, Lord. My boat is so little and your sea so large. Can I come in? (door opens) I'm tired. I want to go to sleep. Can't we get on with it? No. No, I'm not going to. Surely, you don't really want to. Do you? Well, not really. But don't you? I do, but I won't. Okay. Mm. (speaking foreign language) Don't you like women? Uh, yes. Do you just want to look? Is that it? I gave my word. "My word." (laughing) (chuckling) (sniffling) (sobbing) It's all gone wrong. We were happy in Africa. We were a family, but dad wanted to come here so bad. And now he's dead. The rent is ridiculous. He took everything. Jasper and then Roscoe. He helped, but he's inside now, and I love him. It'll be all right. Go up to your room. You are safe now. I've never slept on me own before. I'll be ever so quiet. We had to get money somehow. Jasper said mom could live free if I went with him. What am I gonna do? What's gonna happen to us? The house? Give the house away? Mm-hmm. To whom? To Salambo and her family, her people. Charming. Where are the papers? I'm ready to sign. Here are your papers, sir. Give them to me. No. (laughs) I'll give you the strawberry. I don't care about the strawberry. Give it to me. No, I don't. (humming) Come on, Laszlo. Give it to me. ** Sir, I have an idea. If you're feeling philanthropic, make a contribution to a recognized charity. We can claim it against the tax. My mind is made up. But if all those people can live for free in all those houses, who is going to pay us rent? You will alter the balance of power. Do you remember the Versailles Treaty? (Salambo laughs) Rent? What rent? Your father bought up all this property during the war as a little nest egg for you, for us. This street? From end to end. Oh, how could you, father?! Hey, you're our landlord. You never told me! You never asked me, sir! Where do you think your money comes from? (humming) No! No, no! If I own all the street, I will give it all away! All the poor people will have all the houses! Fantastic! Give him the papers! (gunshot) Give it to me! But the shareholders, what about them? What about them? You know them as the Patriots from Saragossa, sir. Oh, Saragossa! Very well, sir. Please accept my resignation. No, no. You are fired! (chuckles) Whee! Come on. Here's a guy. Put it, uh, right at the top. I can't reach it! Try again. Where's mom? She's at the laundry. Where? Hey, thanks for the fireworks, mister. They're great. We got 25 rockets... Uh, good! We're all gonna live in his house! Oh, great! Good, good! Where'd they go? They've gone to the laundry. You sure? Yeah. Go on. Have you seen my mum? Get out of it, you little trollop! Go on, get out of it! There she is, over there. Hey, mama. Mama... (both speaking foreign language) Dont worry with that, girl, he no good. Go ahead, talk to yourself! Busy body! Mama, come. (overlapping chatter) Ladies! Listen to me. You bloody ingrate! (Leo) Please. No, listen, please. Go back where you come from! Please, ladies! Please. Please, listen to me. I want to help you, all of you. He helped me. Now, we all-- (shouting in foreign language) (all laughing) Shut up and listen! He's a good man! He's trying to tell you now. He brought us food and clothes. (speaking foreign language) Hey, what is a nice girl like you doing in a place like this, huh? (all laughing) I am guilty of your poverty. Let me repay you. First, you repay me. You owe me for Salambo, right? Yes, you do! What has that man ever done for you? I tell you he is out to keep you poor! Just as I am. Now, that's enough from you. Now, get out! Don't refuse me. Listen! (woman) Oh, Roscoe! I have money. Roscoe! We can make it in the good place. I give you everything. There's Roscoe! I promise. Roscoe. (woman) Roscoe's back! Look out! Salambo's my girl! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! You evil bastard! I'll kill you! Get him off me! Get him-- get him off! I'm gonna kill you! He's evil, this bastard! He's evil. I'm going to kill him! I'll kill him! She was just a kid! She was just a kid! What does he think he's doing? Get him off! I'll kill him! I'll kill him! I am Jasper! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I am Jasper! I'll kill you! What is this about buying and selling? Leave me alone! (Salambo) Roscoe! Roscoe! He's gonna give us all the houses! Roscoe! He's a madman! Those who have it keep it! They never give anything away! Roscoe! Roscoe! I love you! He never touched me! I was saving her for you. Roscoe, there is no hope for the world if you can see no possibility for improvement. Roscoe, trust him. Trust him. Show us, show us, then we'll trust you. (woman yodeling) ** Show me! (all cheering) (woman) Come on, let's go! Come on, let's go! (all singing indistinctly) ** It's amazing. The whole street's gone mad. It's great! ** (singing, shouting) ** Now, all you people, go quietly back to your homes. (Salambo) What are they doing? This man has no legal right to offer you anything. Leo, my darling... I'm sorry-- I should have never left you. Now, we're all going to the country, peace and quiet. Stand aside! Come on! Leo! This man is not responsible for his actions! (singing out) Can't you see he's mad as a hatter? Mad as a hatter! Mad as a hatter! (all chanting) Mad as a hatter! Mad as a hatter! Mad as a hatter! Mad as a hatter! Mad as a hatter... No, no. (chanting stops) And there's your answer! Well, what did you expect? Let's go! No, Roscoe! These people are mad! This house is yours! Take it! (Salambo) Give him a chance! Give him a chance! You bitch! You bloody bitch! Hmm? I'll kill you! It's all your fault! Let go of me! (all shouting) Margaret! That's it, that's it! That's enough! Stop it! Margaret, please! Dah! Aah! (indistinct shouting) (Margaret) Get your filthy black hands off me! I want you! Oh, my God, I want you! Take me to the palace! Take them! Put me down! I want you! I want you! I want you. Oh, God! God! I want him! This is mob rule, I believe. Jungle law! As legal representative, I demand safe conduct. I have a heart condition! I have a heart condition! I'm not to be exposed to this sort of thing! (Max) Habeas corpus, from the Latin. "To have his body!" May I have my body back? I am a doctor. I have special privileges! I have my own parking space, you know! (Max) Let me be legal advisor! Moderate charges! Please! Put me down! I shan't tell anybody! Absolute discretion! Hippocratic oath, you know. (Max) We can't go back to-- (cheering) (woman) Oh, God, there's another lot! Laszlo, please. Come on. Come on, Kowalski. Come down here, you big baby! (crowd laughing) Come on. Now, there's no honey for you tonight! (laughter) You come here, or I cut it off! (laughter) You better come home before it's too late, brother! (cheering) Sorry, big guy. I sure love my honey pot. (crowd cheers) Come back here! (Jasper) It's all right for you to have principles, Leo! You can afford to choose poverty! (booing) Laszlo, surrender. I command you. Go back, sir. Go back or I'll fire. Give it to me. Please. Laszlo. Yeah? Saragossa. Saragossa? See the strawberry. Strawberry? Roller skates. Father. (gunshot) (screaming, shouting) Leo! Leo! I'm sorry. I had to do it, sir. Leo! (woman) Oh, God, they're gonna kill us. Oh, God, they're gonna kill us all! The die is cast. The die is cast. There's only one way. Shh! Don't panic, don't panic. Don't panic! Don't panic! Move on! Move on! Fall back quiet. Fall back quiet. Don't panic. There's only one way for us now. Only one way, but don't panic. Organize yourselves. Organize yourselves. Come back this way. Come on. Come on. (man) Only one way. (men singing in foreign language) ** (man) Fire! Fire! (chaotic shouting) (man) Use your weapons. Fire! Fire! (gunshots) (Salambo) There he is! (Leo) Give up and surrender! Never! Go! (fireworks whistling, exploding) (man) Come on! Come on. (all shouting) (man) Let us out! Come on, let's go! Come on! Come on. (group singing) ** Don't come too close! Come on out. We won't hurt you. Come out! (speaking foreign language) (chanting) Come on! (all) Out! Out! Out! Out! Out! You're burning, but you just don't know it! (woman) Well, you are anyway! You're all burning, but you just don't know it! (chanting) Laszlo! Laszlo! Laszlo... (crowd quiets) (explosion) (screaming) (crowd quiets again) (explosion) (screaming) ** (woman) Are you all right? (man) Where are the children? (coughing, crying, groaning) (man) Here-- over here! Come on! Well, you didn't change the world, did you? No, but we changed our street.
