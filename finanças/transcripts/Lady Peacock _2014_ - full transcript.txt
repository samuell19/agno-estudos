♪ [glass shatters] Once upon a lady-boy's dream, in sophomore year of high school, phishy-flamer Edwin crowned the nerdy homo, Conner, his best friend. Conner thought Edwin was the greatest. A true queen to learn from, and Edwin absolutely creamed over the attention. Soon enough, fresh meat Brett, the hunky stallion of a jock, put a plug up their friendship, if you know what I mean. Yes huntees, all the boys could do was think about the yummy, hot, top of a butch, Brett. Delish. Edwin joined every sport Brett played, while Conner just sat on the sidelines too afraid to make a move. Edwin even tried to snatch his way into Brett's house! Trifling tranny. All Conner could do was hope and pray to the fairy gods above that his dream jock would finally notice him. Mmm, tasty. Then something fantasmic happened junior year. The fairy gods were listenin' and Brett was assigned a seat right next to Conner. Conner was an A+ student in Algebra... Fuckin' genius, queens. Brett was a total starfish, pretty to look at, but ain't got no brains for days, huntees. After a year of pent-up homo-erotic butt-chumming aggression, Conner finally got his man-hunk's attention and was asked over to his house to tutor! Yes God, honey! Every Tuesday and Thursday they spent hours and hours upon hours divulging algebra. Well, the fantasy didn't last long. Do you remember that creaming flamer, Edwin? Well he decided to stalk their every move and just like that, Conner's dream crumbled when Edwin ripped poor Conner out of the closet; announced he was gay. Brett freaked the freak out, called Conner a fag, and that "See you next Tuesday" of a hag, Edwin, just stood there giggling! Drama! ♪♪ Come on Conner! We're clubbing. Hurry up! Settle down, bitch! I'm coming! Whew! Oooow! Everyone and their daddy is here tonight. Let us off here, Michael. I'm not walking in by myself. We're just getting in line. If any of you goes in without me, I'm leaving you here. Do you really think we're gonna get in before you find a parking spot? Don't be a bitch, Matthew. Just don't go in without me. Can't you just park the car and come find us? Must we get all dramatic before we even go inside? I wasn't acting dramatic, Conner. Yeah, but you were acting like a cunt. Alright ladies, are you ready for getting into action? You think Michael's ever gonna find a parking space? I don't give a fuck! Dinero? Chavo? Mm-mm, new jeans honey, new jeans. Why don't you...

You wouldn't happen to have an extra cigarette? [laughs] I don't smoke. She doesn't smoke. Don't come to my show, bitch. Nasty! [laughing] What a bitch! Who, the drag queen? Yes! She was all like, "Oh you came running over here for a cigarette." No bitch, I thought you was Jennifer Lopez. I thought that's... I thought that's how you guys talked to each other. You guys? I meant the three of you. To each other, yes, but not to strangers. I thought he was too fat for the shirt he was wearing. Oh my God, he was too fat for that shirt. The one with his hat turned backwards, pretending he wasn't 30? Mmhmm. He was so pathetic. Let's just leave. I need cigarettes and head. Oh he's probably in the woods. The woods.

So you uh, wanna take a shower? I can take one when I get home. Come on. It'll be fun. I'm okay, Conner. What are you afraid of? I'm not afraid of anything. I just wanna take things slow. Alright, will you at least wait while I take one before you run home? [thud] Conner, you alright? Yep! - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. I just slipped on the damn towel from last night. Oh, well good thing I didn't wanna take a shower. [birds chirping] Good morning. Have you seen my hat? You weren't wearing one when we came out here. I gotta get home. Can I get ya some breakfast first? I never eat breakfast. I was hoping for a ride home in exchange. Why don't we just take your car? My car? This isn't my car. Hey. Remember that guy, Mike, I was telling you about? Yeah. Well, he finally asked me out. - Cool. - Yeah. You know where he's taking me? Where? The Shark Fin. Oooo. - Alright. - Fancy So okay, I need your help, okay. A few options. What do you think of this? Well what do you mean? Too much? Uh... Too much. Wait, I have a few options. This green, nice. This one's a little more sophisticated. You know what, this one I really like. What do you think? That one's pretty cool. Yeah. I'm sorry, I'm just not, haven't been given that ability. My brother finally comes out and he wasn't given that ability. You know what, Devan, I must say, I'm very disappointed by this whole thing. You are so lucky he doesn't run like a girl. Mm-hmm. What's your problem? I'm not out to everyone. Oh, it's okay bubby. I'm not out to everybody either. Where did this come from? The floor of the car. Matthew dropped more than his pants last night. Mm-hmm. Do you smoke? David, can I have one of those? Does this look like Calais? I only want one. I'll buy you another pack. I only have a few so make them last. I love you. You really need to start carrying your own cigarettes, Conner. He's pissed at you. He's always like that. So does someone have a membership here or something? One of Michael's ex-boyfriends used to work here. So we're breaking into a private pool? We have a key. We've done this a thousand times. Well I have a pool at my house. Yeah but at this one we don't have to wear our bathing suits. Crap! When you graduate school, you're gonna build houses? Well I have to draft a lot of different design plans, but a construction company will build them. I'll probably start off with houses and then eventually work my way up to skyscrapers.

We go on like two dates and all of a sudden you're pulling this "jealous boyfriend"? It's not very attractive, Conner. What's his problem? Thick eyebrows. [both laugh] Would you like some paper for that pencil? I would expend a little more girth for a man your age. Well why don't you whip yours out so we can compare? Oh Conner, you know what it looks like. It hasn't been that long. All I remember is a lot of unnecessary extra skin. So what do you want, Edwin? That sexy little thing you call Devan. Why? Because, he's yours. Oh no, bitch. Fuckin' with the wrong queen. God dammit! Don't fuck with me, Conner. Better not tear my fucking vest, Edwin. Oh your cheap-ass vest you filthy varmint.

I wanted to show you the new designs we made. Well then, I guess I'll see you tonight when I get home. Alright, I want her to think I like her, but I don't want her getting the wrong idea. What's the wrong idea? I don't want the flowers that say "I love you." Have you ever given a girl orchids? Dude, your boy knows roses. Roses will make her love you. If you just want to fuck her, you've gotta go with orchids. They're the sex flower. Really? Yeah, they germinate much faster than any other flower, and they release a tonic into the air that science has proven it arouses a woman. It actually gets her wet. You serious? I'll get the arrangement together for you while you go down the block to the liquor store. Get a box of wine. Thanks. Can I purchase you an orchid? Please, the only flower that makes a girl wet is from her pussy. Then why did you tell him all that? Because he's horny and he won't notice that Orchids are ten times more money than Roses. Are you buying me something? I... I... This man is always buying me something. Guess there goes any chance of me surprising you with flowers. Make sure he doesn't spend too much money. I'll see you at home. Perhaps you'd better get going as well. I can explain. It's not necessary. I saw your wedding band the day I met you. People don't look at their spouses like that. You're a very lucky man, Steven. If this continued, you'd lose that forever. I still don't know what to do about this whole Conner thing. Oh, how did your date go? I'd be lying if I said I wasn't checking my phone five times an hour, every hour, just to see if Mike called. And? And, don't ask. I don't know, Dev. I, I believe that with the right person, you can find love. Probably not gonna find it at Calais, though. Look, you know, there's always that chance that one other person in the crowd also searching. But, yeah, you probably would have to find your way through a lot of sleaze there first. Why does everybody just wanna have sex? All people should want to find love before they have sex. You're definitely a rare breed, Dev. Yeah, but how do I tell the difference between somebody who actually loves me and somebody who's just gonna use me? Good question. The first person I ever gave it up for was someone I met at a club. Whoa, whoa, whoa. TMI. What? You want my help or not? So yeah, I thought he was Prince Charming, saying all the right things, but I saw what I wanted to see, you know? Anyway, after he finally convinced me that I could trust him and he would never hurt me, blah, blah, blah, I slept with him. And he dumped me the next day for the waitress at our favorite restaurant. - Holy shit. - Yeah. I'm so sorry, Gloria. I had no idea. Never put your faith in someone who tells you "Trust me." An honest man will earn your trust. I liar will demand it. [racing sounds from video game] You go to Calais. Yeah so what's your point? When did you get this system? Oh, couple days ago. I just can't imagine you playing it. I don't. I bought it for those girls. They can be themselves here. You're so sweet, Silvia. Most dealers kick you out after a few minutes. Oh God. I think of myself as a therapist. So I met a guy at Calais a couple of days ago. He's real slutty, also kinda girly. Yeah, like what gay guy isn't? [laughing] Actually, I think only a real man can take another man. Well I'm not a man and I can take Link just fine. Link still has boobs. I asked him to keep them. I like boobs. He can't become a real man unless he loses those puppies. [chuckles] I will never understand gay men. How can you not like boobs? I never said I didn't like them. I can appreciate their function. Well these serve a very important function. Oh come on, babe. That doesn't do anything for me, especially on a lesbian. I'm not a lesbian. I'm gender queer. You ever suck on one? When I was 14. 14? 14? I was 16 before I even saw one. I mean like somebody else. Well if it makes you feel any better I only had sex when I was 18. I got you beat on that. I was 17. Mine was with a guy. Well I guess you got all the girls beat on that, bro. Not me. I was 15. Weren't you supposed to wait back then until you got married or something? Honey, I grew up in the '60s when it was hip to lose your virginity at a concert. [phone ringing] Oh, they, they found my hat. I have to go back to Calais. Thank God! It's the only hat I look cute in. The bathroom still unlocked? Yeah, go ahead. Alright so he's really good at it. But just imagine if you beat him. This drag competition is all Edwin has. Then you're gonna have to come down here, baby, cross your name off the list, and give me a ride home. Bitch, I seriously cannot believe you. Well, look what we have here. Tell me, was it easier getting admission on a weekday? Excuse me? The Miss Calais contest, I saw that you signed up. That is correct, Edwin. Do you actually think you have a chance at winning? Please, I have just as much chance as you. There are a lot of names on that list. Please, five fucking hundred guys could sign up on that list and I would still win. Conner's name is the only name you should be worried about. Would you stay out of this, Matthew! Hey! Ball juice! I'd be nice to me if I were you. I just happen to know a serious, fucked up people who would love to meet a little girl like you. So why don't you and your sister act there get the hell out of our faces? - Sister act? - Shh! Your boyfriend, Devan. Nice ass. He's not my boyfriend. That's right. He's mine. See you at the competition. Heels on. I am gonna fucking kill you, Matthew. [ding dong] Whoa! Why is every guy I meet dressing up like a woman? Shouldn't you be with Edwin? I just came over to see if I left one of my credit cards in your room. You're not even here to see me? Can you just look please? Alright, give me a minute. It's not here. You must have left it at Edwin's. Do you think David and Michael are assholes? When, now? I just had a really bad night at Calais and I wanted to leave, but they still had drinks in their hands, so they wanted to stay. And that surprises you? I thought friends were supposed to be there for each other. They're flakes, Conner. You can't expect them to be there when you have a serious problem. That's what real friends are for, like me. So you think I really have a shot at getting Devan back if I win this competition? It's all about having confidence in yourself, Conner. Well, Edwin doesn't think I have any chance of winning at all. Not if you look like Kathy Bates. I just have a problem with the makeup. I think every gay man has one gay talent. Some can dance, some can sing, and others know the entire score to Hello Dolly. And what's your gay talent? When you supply the weed you don't need a gay talent. Well let's just hope my gay talent is doing drag. There's one big problem though. Whose gay talent is makeup? Are you sure this is gonna look good? It doesn't feel right. It feels like too much. Oh my God, Angie, would you please shut the hell up and trust me? I know what I'm doing. Right, I mean it just feels like too much blush, too much eye liner. I do not wanna look trashy. I think I know how much eye liner is too much. I went to beauty school. Ooo, goody. - You know what's funny? - Hmm? I had a dream last night that I was doing the makeup for a beautiful actress. It was her film debut. She told me that she was gonna be a star and that I would be her personal stylist. - Nice fantasy. I suppose until then I'm stuck doing off-Broadway makeup on an obnoxious has-been. Obnoxious? Moi? At least my asshole closes. Oh my God, Angie, your face! [Screaming] What did you do? Oh, I'm gorgeous. Classic. Do you think he would do it? Are you kidding? Michael lives for that shit. Alright. A Rican would make this scene even hotter. Is that right? I just got out of work. Where do you work? The Westin. I'm front desk. Really? I didn't know that. Once a year, I get to travel to any Westin in the world and stay for free for a week. All I gotta do is present this little card. I just get to decide on who I want to bring with me. Would you like a bathing suit? Can't see my ass in a bathing suit. White girl! White girl! [giggling] [giggling] Hey, don't jump behind me unless we're in your bed. Okay, slow down there Edwin. If I go any slower I'll be a virgin again. Kevin Oquan at your service. Oh my God, did you rob Walmart? Ew. We robbed Macy's. My gay talent. David's not that good at apologizing. He smashed my car window last year because I ruined a pair of his jeans. And he still hasn't said "I'm sorry." Did you apologize for the jeans? Like five times! Then why are you still talking about it? The point is, I'm sorry for not leaving the club when you got in that fight with Adora. Did Matthew put you up to this? No, I'm here because I heard how awful you are at doing makeup and I can't allow that. And I'm here because I think Adora's a bigger bitch than I am. Apologies accepted. And I brought a party favor. That had better be something that can be smoked. You know, Conner, I give you credit for competing against Edwin, and peacocking for Devan. What the hell is peacocking? Does no one know what I'm talking about? Well, peacocks spread their fans, shake their feathers to get the attention of their possible mate. And that's what you think I'm going with Devan? Honey, I saw his ass. You better shake those feathers. So are we gonna make this bitch a peacock or what? That's on you, Michael. Unpack the bag. Repack the bowl. You stay right there.

Let's just say they've got talent. So you wanna know who won don't ya? I, first off, just wanna say thank you. None of this would've been possible without your expertise; and secondly, I'd like to thank myself, 'cause God knows I'd rather be in the bathroom doing lines than under these hot fucking lights. [laughter] Uh. There was so much amazing talent tonight. But there can only be one winner and a ton of losers. There's actual ways to ... [laughter] What the hell did you seal this with? And finally, can the lesbians in the back of the room please shut the hell up? Fuck you! Bring out the broads! Yeah, don't you dare for one second think that just because you're a lipstick lesbian, I don't know that you'll get on your back and have your pussy eaten faster than I can say The Ellen Show, okay? Calm yourself down! Okay? Alright, and the winner is... Adora and Lady Peacock! Oh my God, we have a tie. Oh my God, I love it! How exciting. Great! That means we gotta be back here next week for a head-to-head drag off. Adora and Lady Peacock, wherever you are you better sharpen those claws cause you're gonna need them. Excuse me. Yes dear. Are you sure it's a tie? Well if 60 points is the same as 60 points, then yes it's a tie. Enjoy the rest of your evening, bitches. See you all next week. I'll be in the bathroom, if anyone needs me. Good night, see ya later. Hello ladies. - Congratulations! Oh my God! - Thank you so much. Oh my God! Congratulations! Thank you. - How do you feel? - I feel spectacular. You look great. [cursing in Spanish] Puerca! - She's a bitch honey. - She's just jealous. You know what? That's okay, you did great. - I can't believe it. - Thank you so much. You know, this is the first time I've ever done this. You look great. You're a natural. - So how do you feel? - Amazing. That's one thing this bitch can't take away from this. Honey, she is just jealous. Hey baby, you got a cigarette? Ah! Get off of me! Somebody help! Ow! Ah! Get off me! Stop! Oh no! You like beatin' up drag queens, right? You little bitch! Hey I don't wanna cause any trouble. Oh my God! Is that Lady Peacock? You really are Rosie the Riveter. Come on baby. You're all right. You're okay. You're okay. ♪♪ Aren't you guys friends with Lady Peacock? We did the makeup. Well some guy just beat him up! Oh my God! Is he okay? I think so. I told my husband to drive him home. He's outside if you wanna see him. You can stay here and drink your martinis all you want, but let me give you a little piece of advice. You might be safe in here. Outside is a different story. It could've been any one of us. We should go see him. Yeah, okay. You saved my life. Nah, you know what? That's what lesbians are for. I never got your name. Ariana. That's a pretty name. Listen, you ever have any more trouble, you give me a call, alright? Good night, babe. How many daddies you got, Matthew? None. So are we going? Are you okay? No, not really. You look fine. Oh my God! It looks like you had sex with Ike Turner. Stop! [laughs] Is it really that bad? No. The puffiness will go down and you'll be fine. I have to perform on Saturday. Well then you better find a way to bring Lady Peacock to that competition. Steven, just take me home. Did something happen to Conner? Go away, Devan. I won't be back too late. But I might need you to close up for me. Just take the money from the cash registers and put them in the safe and I'll take care of them in the morning. No problem honey. Okay, good night. One vodka and one whiskey please. I heard you know Matthew outside of Calais. I never told Jerry. You're married, Steven. We just went to dinner, that's all. Why? Forgive me, Conner, but I just turned 53 and a 20 year old found me attractive. It was pure lust. I was stupid. I envy what you have with Jerry. I thought I almost had it with Devan. I would've loved for him to be my first. You're still looking for your first? No, but it would've been nice. Yeah. The toughest thing about being gay is that there is not gay guidebook. There should be. Yeah. Bet there are about a billion guidebooks on love and the most proven one of all time, listen to your own heart. Do you think he went to the hospital? I don't know. I wasn't there. Well don't you think we should find out? You do realize that if he got hurt, I might just win by default? Is winning all you're concerned about? Are we gonna talk about Conner all night? No. Good, because I'm getting tired of you pushing away my advances. Well get used to it cause nothing's gonna happen tonight either. Are you serious? This is why we're here, Devan. I, I don't see the big deal. It's just sex. Not a big deal? It is too a big deal. I don't want my first time to be with just anybody and I certainly don't want it to be with somebody who's going to insist I give it to them. I'm not insisting. You can trust me. You know, you're not the person I wanna be doing this with. So you're just gonna go run off to Conner? With his face all smashed in... I thought you said you weren't there. Come on Conner, pick up your phone. Closed. Michael, do you know where Conner went? Where's Conner? He's with Matthew. Do you have Matthew's phone number? What do you need it for? I need to talk to him. It's very important. Thanks. Matthew, it's Devan. Is Conner okay? Well Edwin said that... I'm at Calais. Matthew's on his way. So you're the famous Devan? Why are you suddenly so concerned about Conner? I thought Edwin was your boyfriend. Edwin say Conner get beat up and he didn't do anything about it. He was there? Yeah. Is Conner okay? You know, none of this is would've happened if you didn't go home with Edwin in the first place. I needed a ride home, and I would've gotten one if Conner hadn't walked off into the woods. Please, Conner went into the woods and saw some chubby, hairy, guy give head to a short, bald guy and decided to go home alone. Edwin said Conner has been with a ton of guys. Far from it. If he said that, it's only because he doesn't want you to be with Conner. Edwin doesn't like you. To him, it's all the competition. You're the prize. Well then I'm gonna break the lock on Edwin's locker and destroy his entire outfit. No, I have a better idea. Oh my God, I have the most amazing idea in the world! This is what we're gonna do. [whispering] Dress him just like Lady Peacock. Money makes the world go round. The world go round. The world go round. The world go round. What the fuck? Oh God! What the fuck! Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! [crying] Hello? Great Aunt Patricia, this really isn't a good time to talk. You sent him the naked picture? No. I'm gonna have to call you back later. I really don't wanna be here. You have to. No I don't. Look, look, we'll stay in the back. No one will see us. We'll wait until they introduce you and then we'll bring you out and explain everything to the judges. [applause] Good evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Dollar Drink Night. How you all doin'? Ugh! And the drag off competition which is brought to you by Butter Lube. Goes best on your buns after they've been warmed up. So how is everyone tonight? This place is fuckin' packed! I haven't seen this many queers since like... Judy Garland, London Palladium. November 8, 1964. Ah yes. Thank you Liza. So let's give a nice, warm, welcome once again to our wonderful judges. Judges, how ya doin'? I'm good as long as we can avoid playing Mariah Carey; I think we'll be alright. I'll check with the DJ. Judge number two, how are you doing? I had a very nice sexual encounter this evening in the woods! That's nice, that's great. Liza, do I dare ask how you're doing? I took a happy pill! [laughter] So for all you pole smokers who were not here last week, we ended in a tie, and tonight we're gonna break that tie and we are gonna crown the new Miss Calais. So let's bring back once again, all the way from Raleigh, North Carolina, Miss Adora, and local girl, Lady Peacock. [applause] Where is Lady Peacock? Was she not in her dressing room getting ready? I don't know. I came by myself. Okay tonight we seem to have a problem ladies and gentlemen. Adora has entered the stage and Lady Peacock is... making a fabulous entrance! God! You?! This isn't Lady Peacock. I'm sorry? This is my boyfriend Devan. I'm not your boyfriend. Huh? Conner is Lady Peacock. This is Devan. Well I just may be a bitch with a microphone, but if the boy if the boy says he's Lady Peacock... You guys all know me. I can tell you that I have met the guy who plays Lady Peacock and I can assure you, that gentleman is here tonight. On this stage stands Adora and Lady Peacock. They are the only two finalists competing for the crown tonight. So without further ado, let the drag off begin! Well what are we waiting for? You're waiting for me, honey. Judges, are we ready?
