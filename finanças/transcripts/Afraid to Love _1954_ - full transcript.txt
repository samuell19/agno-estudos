THE CONFESSION OF INA KAHR Based on the novel of the same name by Hans Emil Dits Let me in! I want in, too. One after the other. Excuse me, I'm a reporter! How do you know I'm not? Come, Kaspar. Don't be so pompous. Check this out -- a gift of nature! Unbelievable! I took extra time off to see a murder trial and now it's sold out. We should have gotten up earlier. This always happens when a case hits the papers. Isn't there some way I can still be let in? Looks grim, the room is already over-filled. Or are you a witness? No, no. Thanks anyway. You're making it very difficult, for us Madame Defendant. You've said nothing. You haven't answered a single question. It is our job to find the truth. Perhaps the truth will help you. But for that, you must talk. So speak to us. As Head of the Tribunal, I have made every effort to try to understand your point of view. Isn't it only fair you do the same for the Court? Well then, if you don't helps us now to find the truth, to grasp your motives... ...motives which lessen your guilt, well then, Madame Defendant... ...your life is in jeopardy. I know. And still you will not speak? My child... ...please... Didn't you hear? Your father spoke to you. Witness Hallgarten, please approach. Convince your daughter to finally break her pointless, dangerous silence I will try, Your Honor. But first I must correct the record. Sadly, I have not always shown my daughter only fatherly affection. I see that now. When I should have been there for her, I left her alone. Ina -- I say it here before all these people. If there is guilt here... ...then part of it is mine. [Ina]: NO! You say no, my child. But how can you defend me when you say nothing? The judge made it clear -- you aren't surrounded by enemies. The court doesn't just want the truth, it wants to help you. [Prosecutor]: Very good, Professor. A prosecutor must generally be harsh. Madame Defendant, Your father just said: Here you have no enemies. That goes for me as well, if you can understand that. This is the last day of trial. So I must warn you: speak, for heavens' sake. She was like this even as a child. It isn't defiance -- please believe me, sirs. Perhaps she even wants to speak, but cannot. The door to her soul has been locked. That's how I see it. If only we had the key... Maybe I had that key before I went to America. I am sorry, sirs. I believe... ...I cannot help you. You talked about your trip to America. I'd like to ask the witness a few more questions. We know you went to the states because you disliked your son-in-law, the deceased, Paul Kahr. Please answer this question: Why did your daughter not inform you of these events? You only learned of the case of Ina Kahr from the newspapers. Yes, that's true. I no longer had contact with my daughter. I knew of her husband's instability and knew the marriage was in danger. There were no more ties between us... we had grown apart. Yes, we know. The magistrate would have notified you if your daughter had not lied on this form... In 'personal information'... The defendant wrote 'Parents deceased. Both parents... ...my mother in June 1932, my father last year, in Detroit, USA'. I didn't know that. Ina -- the breach between us was that final? I didn't know. [Prosecutor] Yes. This fact is the ultimate confirmation of the impression the defendant has made on me so far: utter lack of any feeling. I have no more questions. Don't attract attention. I feel awful. If they sentence her to death... Calm down! No further questions? Good. The evidence has been heard. The prosecutor may speak Sirs. A man has been killed. His wife, the Defendant Ina Kahr confessed. Her reasons, her motive are unknown to us because she will not speak You have seen yourselves how much patience, how much calm persistence the court has tried over and over to bridge the gap with the Defendant without results, without success. Doesn't it show an incomparable lack of feeling-- when the Defendant declares her father dead? Only because she decided to move away for highly personal reasons? Doesn't this contemptible act fit with the Defendant's overall character? Her indifference toward the breach with her father? The calculated cold-bloodedness of the killing? I say it all fits together! It fits perfectly! No! It's not true! Father -- I wanted to spare you all this! Order! Order! No show of opinions! Must I clear the court? The defense lawyer will address this outburst from the Defendant. No human being has the right to take another human life. Punishment must follow. Sirs: You must make a very difficult decision. Look at the Defendant's countenance. Marked by the paths of leaden tears. Tears of remorse? or fear of death? or of pride? We don't know. From what we know, there is only one conclusion. The Defendant acted from treacherous and base motives. This satisfies the legal definition of murder. The law commands: Murder is punished by death. For Ina Kahr, I request... the death penalty. You should be slapped with a wet cloth, screaming like a locomotive! Hysterical! I can't help it! The death penalty! Do you know what that means? Excuse me -- has the Court pronounced sentence? How should I know? Go in there if you're so curious. Come, Jenny. The Prosecutor's job is easy. He only needs to cite laws, the sentence comes on a silver platter, so to speak. As a defense lawyer, I should know my client's motives. Yet I know no more than anyone in this room. Neither you nor I have any reliable information. We must use both our heads and hearts to arrive at a just verdict. A crime occurred, and Ina Kahr has confessed to it. But that is not all. Here is a person who wants to pay for her crime... ...a person who wants to die. I cannot help but think that by her silence, the Defendant wants us -- and you, sirs -- to be forced to fulfill her suicide wish. I repeat -- Ina Kahr wants to force us to fulfill her death wish. Consider that, please. Think carefully whether you can assume that kind of responsibility. Ina Kahr: I beg of you -- use your last chance to break your silence. It's still not too late. I ask for my sentence. The prosecutor has requested the death penalty. He believes this is a case of murder. But what a huge universe of other possibilities there are! Fear... desperation... The whole range of human passions. Self-defense... emotional disturbance... I say manslaughter. How could I possibly ask for anything but the most lenient sentence? And perhaps even this punishment would still be too harsh. "Ina Kahr Trial -- Death Sentence!" Where should we send these things afterward? I asked you where to send them? I don't care. You don't? We follow regulations here. Tell us your father's address. His name is Hallgarten. Parkstraße 24. I can't do much for you. Maybe a small favor. If you have a request-- Thank you. Get rid of the door... Get rid of the door! Get rid of it! Why is she screaming? -- The poor thing's afraid. Tomorrow it will be quieter. Will she die tomorrow? We all have to die someday. The door... this damned door... When it opens... everything is over! Get rid of the door! What do you want? Jesus be praised. I don't need a priest! Get lost! Come here. Sit down. I'm so scared of that door. When it opens -- that's the end. Give me the key. I'll hide it so well it'll never be found. My child -- This door does not lead only to death. This door leads to a new life. But I'm a murderer. I murdered my child. I am damned. God forgives every sinner who repents. I don't want to pray! God has never listened! He always abandoned me. I'll come back tomorrow to be with you. I'll visit you tomorrow, too. Professor, we'll file an appeal That will buy us a delay. Then what? We need time, Professor. I can't provide any more information. I don't know who Ina knew during her marriage. Tell me about her childhood friend. Marianna? She's on her honeymoon. I don't know where What else should you know... I talked to her parents, just hints, nothing. Professor, don't give up now. If anyone can save her, it's us two. You're doing so much for my daughter. Much more than duty demands. Your daughter is more than just a client for me. This isn't the time to discuss this -- perhaps there never will be a right time... I just want to say -- If she is executed, you will not be the only one to lose a beloved person. I'm fighting this. You should, too. Don't think it's all over. Help me. Excuse me, I have no servants just now. I'll be right back. No-one home, I guess. -- Here comes someone! Can I help you? It'll take a while to explain. Lemme ask you a hypothetical: Say somebody had some information... Something important... life-or-death important... Could you guarantee he wouldn't get hassled? What kind of hassles? What do you want? It's about your daughter! -- Shut up! In that case, please come in. No, no -- first the guarantee. You see, we can't afford to get in trouble with... ...well, you know. To get all mixed up with this business. -- For purely private reasons. You want to remain anonymous. Fine. No, first I want your word as an educated person and all that. All right. Come in. Experiment 325 Paul and Ina Hallgarten Counselor, these people may have something to say Are you kidding? Not with him here. No way, we're leaving Don't worry, he's the defense lawyer Yeah, we know from court. We don't want anything to do with him. Come, Jenny. But I vouch for his discretion. Hmm. Maybe it's just as well if he stays. Please, take a seat and tell us what you know. So... I was there. His last night, and the morning when she killed him. Shut up! First things first. She's emotional, but I'm a practical man. She fainted at trial, maybe you remember. I gave her a bit of a thrashing at home. Then I said to myself: Kastan -- that's my name -- We haven't even introduced ourselves. This is my girl Jenny. Back to business. I'm all business. You should know that we're both kind of hard-up right now. In other words, you want money. Well that's quite a rude way of putting it. Our line of work, my dear fellow, isn't easy. As you get older, you get fed up with it. You want a respectable job. To run a pub, let's say. A little pub near the wharf. That's my dream If you really have something to say that helps my daughter, fine. But get to it! Hear that Jenny? A historic moment -- We're going to be respectable! When you hear what she has to say -- man oh man, the pub is ours already. No! I don't want to! I don't want to! I want to live! I don't want to die! I don't need wine, just give me bread and water! Please, please let me live! Please! I'll do anything you want, just please let me live! Calm down. Please, please life... life... life.... The priest has arrived. He will help. Dear God, please don't let me die! Dear God! Pray with me, my daughter. God in Heaven, take away my sins. Forgive our trespasses as we forgive the trespasses of others. Come with me. Where? You have visitors. We'll come for you when time's up. You? We have good news, my child. We won the appeal. A witness gave new evidence favorable to you. Your case will be re-opened. My child... Ina... aren't you at all happy? I don't want any of this. I just want to be left alone. Miss Kahr -- I'm not sure you understand what winning the appeal means. The death sentence is lifted. You could even be acquitted. That will depend on the jury, of course. But we will show the court you were miserable in your marriage. You can't do that! You know nothing about it... nothing. We know this person made you unhappy. He made me utterly happy. Good God, you can't say that in court! I will say it! You're forcing me to! You're still defending him? He can't defend himself anymore. Haven't you thought about me? Even now you still love this disreputable person? This criminal? You were always against him. You never understood him. I curse the day you met him. It was fate. I want to live! I don't want to die! I'll talk to you. I met Paul on the day our experiment finally succeeded. Experiment 325. Do you remember? Look at you both, cooing like turtledoves. Children, this is going too far. You'll be late. Damn! Marianna's engagement party! I completely forgot! Quick, children, get dressed! I'll have to wear a tux. Those dull old moneybags... What am I supposed to do there? You said you'd go. I didn't say I'd go, Ina did; it's her friend. You're trying to weasel out. Tell them Grandma got drunk, slipped in the basement, and can't be left alone. I'll have to sacrifice. I thought you wouldn't make it. Where's the Professor? Caught up in work. You know him, he thinks of nothing else. In other words... -- He's in his lab and doesn't care about my engagement. I find it a bit rude but I understand The main thing is that you're here. Come here. This is Upsi Sørenson, my fiancé. This is Ina Hallgarten. We were in Lausanne together. And if nothing comes between us, we'll be best friends for the next 100 years. That's the truth. My congratulations to you both. How nice of you, Ms. Hallgarten. I'll try not to disturb your friendship with Marianna Shall we drink some Champagne? Later, darling. Why don't you go back to the older people. Come back when you're done with your game of bridge. You seem in a bit of a strange mood, Marianna. Is something wrong? Nothing. Listen. You two cook up your potions in your lab, that's your goal. My daddy's a businessman. You help your father in a white lab coat, I help mine in a white wedding dress. How awful! What do you mean? Each one has her role. I marry Upsi Sørenson, and that eliminates one of my father's competitors. Love's not very important, but good business is. You find it a bit strange. I understand that. But I'm not sentimental. So you're marrying someone without loving him? Very true, madam. Romance is un-modern. Otherwise I'd give him over there a closer look. He's head of advertising at the Sørenson firm. He's got no chance against the respectable Upsis of this world. Today you've become my boss's wife. Can I dance with you? Today you've become my boss's wife. May I dance with you? Of course. I need to pay some attention to my guests. But Ina, feel free to dance if you like. She's magical. She saw immediately I wanted to be alone with you. I should really have asked for permission. But you would've said 'no'. I'm a bit drunk. We should make ourselves some mocha. Drink makes one confident. So I'll take the plunge and ask whether I can pick you up tomorrow at 7 AM? We'll take a country ride. Where do you live? At 7am? You'll still be asleep! I never sleep... So, what do you say? Tomorrow at 7? Honk twice, once short, once long? Where? They broke the mold when they made you. Of course you won't come. Parkstraße 24. Parkstraße 24. Thank you. So tomorrow morning at 7. I'll honk twice -- once short, once long. So now we will drink genuine Turkish mocha. Black as night. Hot as hell. Sweet as love. What's going on? No time now, we'll talk a little later. Goodbye! So what can I serve you -- Tea or coffee? Coffee, please. Good. Tea-drinkers are boring. Romantics love coffee. It inspires the imagination. But you don't know me at all -- We met for the first time last night! Oh, we've met many times in a past life. Sugar? I think you're making fun of me. To the contrary, I'm dead serious. So serious it surprises me. Come closer, or you'll slide off the blanket. Strange -- you have 2 of everything... ...two plates, two cups, two Thermos bottles... ...but only one blanket. Hm, You're right. Well, blankets are incredibly expensive. I could hardly afford two. More sugar? Do you know what you look like right now? Like an enchanted, delicate flamingo. That's what struck me last night. Don't compliment me. I wasn't complimenting you. But you do compliment other women! Yes... other women. ...the scent of your hair... You think I'm a playboy, right? Maybe I am. But not with you, I swear. I'll be honest for you. Damn! I'll kill them! It's a proper invasion. They can go to hell. Let them have their fun. No way. What a bunch of squares! Hey you! If you want to swim I warn you: There's a huge water rat there! Give up, young man. You can't scare me away. I used to pull tricks like that. When I was as young and beautiful as you. I know this spot better than you, right darling? We've been coming here for 12 years. Go, you rascals -- jump in the water! For 12 years? Yes, here. We got engaged here. Oh come, they're not interested. Sure we are! See, they are interested. You're just married, right? Yes. Since yesterday. Evening! No, really? Did you hear that, Lisbeth? I've got to show you something. Come look at this. Lisbeth... Hermann. That's us. To preserve the memory forever. Nice, eh? -- Fantastic. Do you have a pocket knife? -- Why not use yours? Why? So I can carve a heart for you with your names. What's your name? -- No. Don't be bashful. We were all beginners once. "Ina." -- And the groom? Now I finally get to introduce myself. "Paul". Ina! It went perfectly! I went through it all again. We did it! We two! Oh father, forgive me for being late. It's just turned 9, right? Yes. Have you even eaten breakfast? Oh father, how wonderful! Who was that you left with so early? An acquaintance. How long have you known him? For a long while. I met him in my tennis club. I saw him again yesterday. Just by chance. I knew you wouldn't approve of this relationship, since it began so quickly, with no formalities at all. But I simply loved him. From the first time I saw him. We met every day. Grandma knew about it. And she helped us. Grandma! Grandma! What do you say to America! I've gotten an offer. An offer for me and Ina. Fantastic conditions. We'll have our own testing facility and an unlimited budget. You mean going to America? You can't be serious. Not serious? Where's Ina? Oh, she probably went to the city to buy carp. You wanted carp, right? Lying doesn't suit your white hair. She's probably with that -- oh well. When she deigns to come back, send her to me. Quick -- just so you know, I said you were buying carp. Carp?! I know, not very original, but I couldn't think of anything else. He also didn't buy it. My child, this can't go on. Tell him everything. But how? You know Papa can't stand him. No matter how much Paul tried. It's jealousy. Jealousy! All fathers of pretty daughters are like that. The man could be a god, but he'll be rejected anyway. You have to make it a fait accompli. Get married. Go inside to him -- he has some news for you. America said yes! Isn't that wonderful, Ina? To finally have everything we need. Aren't you glad? Of course! Listen, we won't give up all this. I'm too old for that. But we'll go over there for one or two years. What do you think? I think I know what's going on behind this forehead. I'll be honest: I'm happy about the offer for other reasons. I know more about this thing with Paul Kahr than you think. I'm glad this offer will end it. It won't end. What do you mean? I won't leave Paul We've worked together for years. We've built something. Now we have an opportunity many people would envy us for. And you want to throw it all away? For Mr. Kahr? I won't leave him. What does this guy mean to you?! Don't talk like that. I looked into this guy. Do you know he's married? Of course I know. Well then? He'll get a divorce. You say that as if it were nothing. You want to take another woman's man. Just like that. I love him. But a marriage is a marriage, Ina. Why did you keep that from me? What would you have done if you'd known I was married? I'd never have agreed to see you again. Exactly. I need you. You have no idea how I lived before. Drinking, women... I'd have gone to the dogs if I hadn't met someone. And now I've found you. If you leave me, I'll go back to my former life. I love you, Paul. You know that. But I can't accept another woman in your life. I just can't. I'll talk to my wife. Our marriage is just a facade, anyway. Then we'll get married. My God, that will be wonderful. Waking up every morning next to you... ...coming home every night to you. My sweet, beloved little girl. She didn't want a divorce. Then I did something awful. Can I help you? I'm Ina Hallgarten. Please come in. It's good you've come. My husband -- I mean Paul -- spoke to me. He wants a divorce. He found you. He thinks -- You're the only one for him. Do you thinks so, too? Yes. Otherwise I wouldn't have dared to come. I believe you. I've been married to him four years. Four years of heaven, four years of hell. One day during Easter I told him: 'Never forget you are free.' 'That you are is more important to me than anything.' 'And that you come back to me.' ...'come back'... He didn't forget. But as for 'coming back'... ...that's off the table. And that is what gave me the courage to visit you. You're very sincere, Ms. Hallgarten. This is actually a death sentence for me. One can't just accept this 'Go now, another's coming.' It's so very hard for me But it's so much harder for you. I'm not here as your enemy. Of course not! You're just here to take my man. From pure love, I know... Sorry, I shouldn't speak that way to you. I wanted to talk to you... To warn you about Paul. But now you're here, I find I can't. Loving him doesn't bring happiness. Paul can't change. He has to destroy -- himself and others. You're surely thinking: 'It'll be different with me.' But it can't be different, because he can't be different. Ah, well... I've lost. I capitulate. Mr. Kahr is here and would like to speak to you. Then let him in. To the lab?! But please, you know why he's come -- to ask for Ina's hand! Send him in! But... but it's insulting! Please don't reject him. Send him in! Let me tell you something. When you approached me about Ina's mother, I wasn't exactly charmed by you. But I thought of nothing but my child's happiness. Now you think of your child. Yes, yes. Hello Herr Professor. Hello. I know what this is about. Save your speech. I don't give my consent. I'm against you. That's pretty obvious. But Ina's an adult. Yes, unfortunately. I have no power to prevent this disaster. How flattering for me. Herr Professor, We all know that sympathy can't be forced. But please don't burden your daughter on account of your dislike of me. She's suffering from the tension. So am I. Herr Professor, I don't demand you embrace me with open arms. But don't estrange yourself from your daughter because of me -- My daughter has proved she cares nothing for me, only you. There's no reason to continue talking. Your decision to go is final? It is. Is it true you won't stay for our wedding? Yes. Then this conversation is over. Wait a minute, we need to talk finances. You will get nothing from me. My daughter has some money from her mother, she can dispose of it. But until your mother-in-law, my grandmother, dies, you'll have to be patient. The old lady's in excellent health. What kind of man do you take me for?! Isn't it grand here? Except for the people. I see no people... Wait, people will think you're my lover! I think you're just a tiny bit drunk tonight. No, I'm very drunk, so to speak, and have been for quite a while now... Since I met you. Darling. I didn't know how beautiful life could be. I didn't know. I'm not the man you think I am. I've never made anyone happy. Oh yes you have. Me. So, now have a cup, and return to Earth. No, you first. I won't drink until you do. What are you doing? Writing letters? Yes, I'm writing a love letter. To whom? To a certain lady. So, here you are: It's our tree! I fell in love with you exactly one year ago. One year ago I told myself: 'I'll never let her go.' 'I'll marry her.' We'll be a very old married couple. In 12 years, we'll celebrate just like that nice, odd pair at the lake. And when that 12 years becomes 50, we'll be a happy old couple. Like Philemon and Baucis. How are you, Ina? Fine. And you and Marianna? You'd know more than me. Me, why? Actually, I should be mad at you. I know girlfriends like to talk, but now Marianna's with you every other evening. Now you're exaggerating! Not really! Yesterday, Friday, Wednesday... She's supposed to be engaged to me. You've seen each other so much lately? And told me nothing? But I want to take advantage of this chance. Promise you'll think of me when you fly to Paris tomorrow. You're flying to Paris? Really, this is becoming embarrassing. They call me 'The eternal suitor' in the club Tell her she can't keep doing this to me. Why can't she decide? I'm no fool... And I like her so much. Which number was it? There, the last house. So, do you promise to do that for me in Paris? I'll try. Thanks! Also thanks. And greetings to the Folies Bergère! I was there once, before Marianna! So, what is Marianna up to? She's never visited us, but I didn't want to expose her secret. Well, Paris is Paris. Popping off to Paris. Didn't know you were flying. That's technology for you. Ah well, technology's not so bad. This young woman, jetting to Paris In my day -- Yes, flying to Paris was quite unusual. But why did she choose me of all people as her alibi? What are you doing? Mister called, he needs me to pack. He's flying to Paris tomorrow. Please go to the kitchen. I'll continue packing myself. Please give me some time, grandmother. Yes, Ina, but -- I don't understand you. Of course I'm flying to Paris! OK, there's no point in denying. I was with Paul, and I wanted to go to Paris with him. Ina, I know this is cruel! You can't take a married woman's husband, but I -- I've heard it often: 'He's cheating on her.' And I thought: 'How awful for the woman.' But you only appreciate it when it happens to you. I want to go home. You can't leave me, Ina. Ina, I love you. I love only you. Yet you went to another. Why? Yes, why? Certainly not out of love. Out of curiosity. A damned opportunity. There's a spark from nowhere, from a glance... ...pigs that we men are... There is no excuse. Ina, come to me. I can't. 'Pigs', you say. And who is condemned to forgiving and waiting? ...forgive, wait... It's grotesque. You're sitting there torturing yourself. And I'm thinking: 'What was all that?' What does it have to do with our live, our love? And if it was the other way 'round? What if I had been the whore? You mean if you had betrayed me? Also grotesque. I believe I could kill you. Try not to look at it so tragically. At least take my hand. I promise I won't see this Marianna anymore. How will you avoid her? When she marries Sørenson you'll see her constantly. We can avoid each other. Haven't you thought about opening your own firm? I have some money from Mama I can give you. What do you mean? You're gifted. Why keep working for other people? Give up your contract with Sørenson. Please. Ina, you don't have to shame me. Of course I've thought of my own firm. There's actually no competition in my field. But... Tell me: Are we back on good terms? Leave Sørenson. You're a wonderful woman. I don't deserve you at all. That's was my fault, my first mistake. Paul did what I wanted, and left Sørenson. And that began his downfall. He lost his footing in life. I thought only about how to keep him from Marianna. He began making bold plans. And then the chapter 'Cora Brink' began. Morning. You came home at 2 AM again. Did I wake you? Sorry. I tried to be as quiet as possible. Tell me, do these meetings with Cora Brink have to go so late? Well, we still have so much to do. We'll open in a few weeks. Cora's got so many ideas. You've seen her sketches. I saw some from her predecessor, too. And? A difference like night and day, no? Yes. But they're too costly. Yes, you're right. We've got to restrain her a bit. But I'm lucky she's on board. She's a star in her field. What does she look like? Is she pretty? Oh yes, she's great for the firm's image. OK, I have an appointment. Got to hurry. I know you need a partner. But does it have to be a woman? Jealous? Is that surprising? Yes, it shouldn't have happened. Are you mad at me? No, I just can't stand this Cora Brink's perfume. All your suits smell of it. I can't tell her to stop wearing perfume. Good morning, Ina. Ladies and gentlemen, I have the great honor of welcoming you... in the name of our new firm. I'm glad so many have come, especially from the press. Greetings also to my colleagues, and last but not least, to the investors. As for the actual speech, I'd rather leave that to the more beautiful part of the firm, namely: Cora Brink! There's really not much to say. Please look around the room. This is our style: A bit daring -- But after all, we want to stand out. I wouldn't mind a word with her. -- Looks like she's very much taken. Our ads should jump out at the viewer and haunt him, just like the impression left by a beautiful woman: lasting. Coffee! An old saying goes: 'Create, artist -- don't talk'. And Professor Dinormi, whose student I was, always said: 'If you have to explain your work, you've lost already.' So we don't want to bore you with our missions and goals. Look at our work and discover our style for yourself. Then we can talk more. C'est tout. Name's Luders. From Luders shipping line? -- Ja. I'll book right now. under one condition: You'll be the model. My ships go to Spain. And who'll be drawing when I'm the model? I want 8 posters for a Mediterranean cruise to Spain. Oh, I love Spain! Really? Well perhaps we can arrange something. Finally. Why are you so late? Sorry. Grandma is very ill. I had to bring her to the clinic. Hopefully nothing too serious. She'd begun sweating. Now she's sleeping, thank God. Right, OK. I'd like you to meet Cora. Ah, Frau Kahr! I'm so glad to finally meet you! Hello Frau Brink. I wish you all success in business. Good luck. Thank you. It's begun well: I already have an order. Luders shipping lines. I'm sorry Frau Kahr, urgent call for you. This carnation's also from that Luders guy, right? I don't like that. You should get clients, but not at this price. What price? -- You know exactly what I mean. But I'm not going to pay the price. But you're tempting him like a coquette. You're letting men fantasize about you! So? How is that your business? Are you my lover? You're my business partner. Stop it! You're jealous! How sweet. Anyway he invited me on a study trip to Spain, but I told him I don't need Spain, I need -- Aren't you going a bit far? I should go even farther. Nobody cares why. And then? I'm a monster. I'll take my wife home then come back. Monster? We have to go to the hospital right now. Grandma's doing very badly. Yes, but I can't leave my guests alone. How is she? -- Already unconscious. She can't hear you. But... she wants to say something. Stay, grandma! You can't leave me! I have no-one else left! Come back to me. Give me one more chance. I have nothing more to give. I'm just tired. Let's begin again. To come back to this point in 2 or 3 months. At least now I have the strength to leave you. I know it's all my fault. You should marry a woman who keeps you uneasy, in suspense... Like Cora Brink. Cora Brink? We're finished. Did she cheat? No, our business is over. I'm sorry to have to tell you, since you invested. After just a few months? But you had clients! Yes, but Cora spent more than we brought in. Your firm no longer exists? It's not wound up yet, but will be soon. I'm sorry to hear that. What will you do? Go back to Sørenson? Never! That'd be too embarrassing. Paul, you must keep the firm I can help financially. Grandma left me more than we expected. I can get money elsewhere. Help me with you. I'll be bankrupt if you give up on me. Not just financially. I... I think things are getting worse for me. I'm afraid. I'm too cowardly to finish it. I need you! I can't tell you how... We were happy together once. Why can't we get that back? That was a long time ago. Please... Help me once more with you. I don't understand! No Courage! No Spirit! No Color! Competent, but nothing more -- certainly not what people expect from us! Then hire Picasso, Mr. Kahr. I'd love to, but he's too expensive. What can I do? It's custom-made, I can't show it to those people. I'll have to put them off. Goodbye, darling. Wait, I think I have an idea. I was thinking of new talent and visited the art school. Ahh, there are no more talented people. Well, I'm not as versed as you, but look at this: I gave them prompts to work with. This one is tea. Hmm... not totally terrible. The art school... Good... excellent, in fact. What's the name? 'Barnholm'. Fantastic -- how witty! Helmut Von Barnholm? Get him here! I already invited him, just wait a minute. Charming... A man from the art school is supposed to be here at 10. He's here already? What? Well I'll be damned. Yes, please. I have a surprise for you. The man is a girl! Miss Barnholm? Pleased to meet you. Name's Kahr. We looked at your sketches. You're very talented. Thank you. I thought you were a man, since you signed 'Helmut'. I thought as a woman I might not get in the door. Oh, that's an old- fashioned idea. These are outstanding. Do you specialize in East Asian graphic art? No, but I grew up in Japan. Interesting. I've got to go to an urgent appointment. You can make further arrangements with my wife. Let me introduce you. Please have a seat. -- Thank you. We'd like to hire you. I'd like to make something clear: I'm terribly interested in earning money, but not a long-term position. That's too bad. But we can play it by ear. That's perfect. It's like this: I'm extremely interested in East Asian graphic art. So eventually I'd like to go back to Tokyo. I'd like to save here for the trip and perhaps a longer stay. That's all. [Furs] We're here with our microphones in an ad agency. We'd like to introduce you to an artist whose designs have impressed her colleagues: Helga Von Barnholm. A charming young woman, and the most charming thing is: She's still shy and modest as a schoolgirl, despite her overnight success. Thanks, please -- that's enough. She's almost reached her goal. Which goal? The trip to Japan! I'm hoping to keep her. Did she give up her plan? She's still considering. By the way, I wanted to give you this. Here you are -- the last payment. I'm proud I was able to repay my debts so quickly. Thank you. Mr Kahr! Excuse me, madam. We need you for the segment "Who discovered me?" But why? Besides, my wife discovered her. But you're the boss. No offense, ma'am. None taken. OK, excuse me. [Sparkling water] The flowers, please. The boss congratulates his employee on their joint success. Really? I agree -- who cares? Come on, you're an ad man. This is the best advertising! So, please hand over the flowers. And now, you'll look at the new poster with your employee. Oh come on, not so stiff! More relaxed! Or are you mad at each other? Mr. Kahr, put your arm on her shoulders. Now look at each other. Fantastic! Perfect! Just like real life! Miss Von Barnholm would like to speak to you. Hello, Frau Kahr. Please sit down. I think I know why you came. But please, go ahead. Back when I met you... ...I could never have imagined sitting here before you. You love Paul. Yes, but we struggled against it. And I should get a divorce. I only had the courage to come here because I know you and Paul are only business partners now. He said that? Yes. It's all coming back. I won't stand in your way. Yet I must say something. The claim that our relationship was only business -- That was a lie. In what way? You said you both fought your feelings. I believe that -- even from Paul. But you stopped resisting when Paul told you that. Yes! Why is it a lie? He was always honest. This is the only time he lied. That proves... ...how much you mean to him. What are you saying? All this time you were more than just friends or business partners? I had a feeling something was happening. But I was too cowardly to ask my husband. He didn't say anything to you? No. In fact, he did everything to sustain the illusion. No... No! He left me... and went to you. I'm sorry. For you, too. Please forgive me. That changes everything. You scared me. Sorry for disturbing you, darling. But I didn't want to keep the news from you. Helga's flying to Japan! Happy now? You're drunk -- Well?! Helga's flying to Japan. You know what that means! Not so loud! You'll wake the maid! So what? You... you want to take Helga Von Barnholm from me. Not true. I told her I wouldn't stand in the way. And at the same time told her I was lying. Do you even know who you're talking to? I'm your wife! Yes, I know. I also understand why you defend yourself when I stray. I'm not that much of a cad, yet. But you... Do you know you also ruined my success? She was the best! And what allowed us to buy all this? The competition tried to poach her from me with fantastic salaries. But she stayed with me. She'd forgotten about all that East Asia stuff. But now she suddenly flies... away. Congratulations. Paul Kahr... once again stares failure in the face. Paul Kahr's nothing. A well-disguised failure. Paul Kahr needs other people's talents. Come to my office; I'll show you a whole drawer of my designs. You'll have a laugh. I keep them well-hidden in a secret compartment. I never sold a single one. 'Sorry, can't use them', they said. 'Hire better people.' Because I never signed the sketches. The conceited Paul Kahr won't expose himself to ridicule. Must keep up appearances, right? And Helga's flying to Japan. 'Night. Forget about last night. That wasn't you. That was the alcohol. Don't you want to talk to me? What for? You shouldn't have said I ruined your career. You're free. You can marry Ms. Barnholm. No point. She's not coming back. What will you do now? How should I know? I can't go on like this. Well, then you'd better go. Farewell. Farewell. But I -- I fired the maid this morning. I didn't want her to see all this. You'll have to hire a new one. Don't need a maid anymore. Don't need anyone anymore. I left. And that was my second guilty mistake. And my greatest. I shouldn't have left him. He needed me. I was gone four months. I thought he'd file for divorce. But I heard nothing from him. Not a word. I traveled. But I couldn't forget that image. How I had last seen him. Surrounded by chaos. And abandoned. And that brought me back one day. A distinguished visitor. This is unexpected. Goodnight, kid. Sleep well. With someone else. So, you're here. Ah, I'm tired. When should I wake you tomorrow? Huh? Aren't you going to the studio? My dear child, you're talking about the past. I'm a free man! I sold the business. Here. There it is. What happened to you? When someone wants to drown, no need to throw a lifesaver. Give him a kick. It'll go faster. Now I'm really drowning... in schnapps, champagne, everything mixed together... That's the best way to drown. Oh by the way, if you're still here tomorrow... we'll have guests. No idea if they'll earn your applause. Such nice people... They're helping me drown. Good night. Everything's fine. Forget it. Forget it. Clarissa, when you look that way... ...then I really want... Go ahead, if you've got the courage. But you don't! I always say champagne must have three qualities: It's gotta be cold, dry... and free! This is my big benefactor. Always says if I'm a good girl maybe I can go to the ballet. I'm Kastan. Pleased to meet you, Mr. Kahr. Jenny's told me so much about you. Well, was she a good girl? No, no -- he'll get curious. 'Course she was a good girl. They're all good girls... ...and at least honest. Go, follow him. Otherwise he'll snort it all away. You always think something fantastic will happen. Always the same. Because they act crazy, or they're drunk. But nothing fantastic ever happens. Why are we together, Paul? What do we have to say to each other? Nothing... nothing. You look tired today, Paul. Or are you sick? Have some of this. It'll do you good. Put that crap away! We're not going to start with that! Well well -- don't be so vulgar, you little street cur. Street cur? So you're an elegant lady, right? Come here, darling. We'll find something better. Well hello! A new face! Never seen you here before. Who is that? I'm Jenny. Well, you're the silent type. She looks like she came from a convent. Shut up! She doesn't come from a convent. She comes from Heaven. She's an angel. And I slaughtered that angel. Know what an angel is? [mumbles] Music! Get out! Get out! Why all the fuss? Ow... my head... Get out of here now! Ha. Don't rush me. I made us some coffee. Black as night... hot as hell. I'm so thirsty. Can you get me a glass of water? I'll get it. Where's the coffee? I drank it. My... my cup too? So? I was thirsty. No! What's wrong? I feel awful. You... what... did? Not like this, Paul. I want to go with you! A doctor! There's no point. Paul, my darling... Take me with you! 'Darling'... So -- you love me, then? You still feel that way? Give me your hand. It's not has hard as I thought. Thank you. Thank you for being there. That you're getting rid of me, although... Sorry, forgot my belt. Probably on the couch there. No! I killed him. What?! Police! Police! You don't need to scream. I'll give myself up. Right now! You hear? Right now! I just committed murder. Marktstraße 24. I had nothing to do with this, you hear? You know nothing, you don't know me. I have... Damn! My belt! Jenny waited until she heard the siren. Then she ran away through the garden. Then I was arrested. I want to go back to my cell. My child, my child -- It's my fault. I failed miserably. I left her when she needed me the most. Counselor -- If something happens to her, I don't know how to go on living. Don't give up, Professor. We'll do everything we can. The fight is just beginning. Come. The whore had more conscience and behaved more humanely than you. Or do you claim you didn't know about it from the newspapers? 'Conscience'. I can't sleep at night. How sad for you. Why didn't you volunteer as a witness? Out of fear. I've since gotten married. Very well, I might add. And my husband Luders is horribly jealous. Fear. Yet another excuse, when a human life is at stake. Don't make that horrible accusation. I didn't have Frau Kahr's life in my hands. Of course you did! Your testimony could have prevented the death sentence. It could have proven that Mrs. Kahr acted out of desperation, not from base motives. But you're still not off the hook, Madam. There will be a new trial, with testimony from all witnesses. And this time public opinion is completely against you. Or perhaps you imagine people will sympathize with the cowardice of a woman who married into money? But when I met Luders, I was already Paul Kahr's friend! If you force me to testify, it will destroy my marriage! My dear lady. You didn't hesitate to destroy my daughter's marriage. In life, you must pay for everything. Dear professor, I'm still in shock. When we got your cable, we took the next ship. What can I do for Ina? Testify, ma'am. Of course, no question. Thank you, Marianna. I expected no less from you. But you were Ina's friend. Why did you do that to her? Why? Probably because I envied her happiness. The judgment is reversed. The defendant Ina Kahr Is hereby sentenced to six months in prison for manslaughter. Her time in jail will be counted against the sentence. The defendant shall bear the costs. What state will she be in, I wonder? I have so much to make up for with her. And I am so grateful to you, Counselor. It wasn't just my work which freed her. Everyone sympathized with her. If only Ina could forget. Professor, take her to America. Show her the world. My little sparrow. Hello. Ina -- life is waiting for you. Life...
