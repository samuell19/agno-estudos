Somebody woke up on the wrong side of the carburetor this morning. Peckerhead. What is, if I may be so forthright in displaying my ignorance, a peckerhead? What you laughin' at, Whalen? Nothing, Richard. I was just thinking how ignorance kills. - What does that mean? - Exactly. You ass-kissing little fuck! Boys boys boys! Dickie! Dickie!

Hello, Lorna. - How are you today, my dear? - Drop dead. - Contact. - Who's that? That, my boy, is Lorna "love-itis" longley, fire of my loins, purveyor of my every masturbatory fantasy. The entire female gender is separated into two groups. Lorna comprises one group. All of womankind comprises the other. You ever take her out? Alas, Lorna is largely untouchable for someone of my social standing. What do you mean? It's a class system, man, at c.B. High, Stevie boy. Check it out. There you got your motorheads. Car jocks.

Keggers can't be choosers. Freaks who fix leaks. Ah, and over here you have your microgeeks. Nerds, whiz kids, and various other bottom-feeders.

Over there you have your skaters-- rippin', ragin' kids and their ramp tramps, baggy pants, Dickie wools, doing 50-50 grinds with an Ollie grab finish on a homemade half-pipe in the woods. The whack of a hacky sack. Ecstasy. E-tab, baby. Longer lovin' through science. Freaks in sneaks. Here's where it gets really nasty. Lorna runs with that group over there.

It's nice to finally meet you. - Everything okay? - Fine. Have you given any thought to extracurricular activities or sports? - Not really. - There's the blue ribbons. The blue ribbons? Yeah, they help each other study and practice. It's a team effort. It's a motivational workshop, really. The blue ribboners have truly been making the grade, and they're doing wonderful things on the playing field. Steven. All of us here are aware of the tragedy back in Chicago. - If there's anything we can do-- - I said everything is fine. Steven... We know how tough it can be.

Cross-pollinating efforts of the student groups has always been our goal, and it's something that benefits everyone. The thespian society, for example-- blue ribbon meeting. Every Monday. This is where the shit goes down. Listen. And by conducting the bake sale in conjunction with the pep rally, we can be selling cakes and cookies at a time when school spirit is at its optimum level. - Wow, I had no idea the evil was this pervasive. - Shh. Yeah, Jan, what's on your mind? This may sound kind of strange, but... Although we couldn't be more pleased with Andrew's improved studies, he's become somewhat... Different... Since returning from your weekend enlightenment seminar. Different how? He seems unkind to almost everyone outside of the club. Okay, well I can understand your concern. Let me address it. Kids, being kids, have, you may have noticed, a tendency to overreact. And we've found they go through a brief period... Of being, shall we say, snobby. But what it really is is a feeling that's new to them. And the feeling is pride. They're improved.

Parents feel candidate is depressed, spending far too much time listening to rock music and masturbating. Candidate has a history of truancy... Poor son of a bitch. And a general lack of direction. Candidate is a c-minus student, yet has a-plus potential. So, all in favor? Great. February candidate confirmed. - Training to begin A.S.A.P. - God. - Shit! - What? Join me in welcoming into our circle of friends Ernest and Lucille strick, The parents of our next superstar, Gavin strick. So they want you to join their club. Shine 'em on, and blow 'em off.

Am I hanging with Trent and Robby and the rest of the robots? God, I hope not. I hit the vents tonight when I split up with Stevie boy. He doesn't believe. I went back to school... And I overheard Caldicott talking to some wonk. Mentioned, um, "Bishop Flats 11." Caldicott called them his "children." Then he freaked out on the guy and kicked him out of his office. So, you know, I figure something's up with that, right? Yeah. Keep an eye on U.V. for me, though I doubt that they'll want him. I doubt that they're interested in the pigmentally challenged. That's not their style. I gotta go get paranoid. This is Gavin strick reporting live from the reconstruction. I pulled this off the a.M.A. Database. Caldicott's last place of employment was just across the bay in Bishop Flats at a place called the Belknap Psychiatric Facility. He spent seven years doing neuropharmacology. Mind control. Next ferry's at 6:00. Bishop Flats? You down for it? Razor. Let's go. I miss Gavin. He was almost like a-- a brother? Yeah. Exactly. I had a brother. Sorry. His name was Allen. He was a couple of years older than me. If he would've made it through his teens he would've been something amazing. But he was-- he was always in pain. And eight months to the day he shot himself, Dad said we were moving to Cradle Bay. Where everything was gonna be all right. I'm sorry. No, don't. Let's go.

Come and get it, you blue bastards! What is going on? Come on. Get 'em to the ferry. I'll meet you down there. Don't leave without me. - Hey, lunch boy. - What are you doing? We can't very well have these-- Shitbirds... Graduating and going off into the world, can we? - Maybe they can be helped. - No, they can't. And neither can I. Do good things, lunch boy. Hey! Teacher! Leave those kids alone! No! It's over, you son of a bitch. It's finished. "Finished"? There'll always be other towns and other troubled teens and other worried parents. Science is god. Be the ball. What happened? We're the only ones left. So, what do we do now? We go home. And where's that? Wherever. Wherever we are. Whoa! Appropriate sparks are flying. Somebody cue up the power ballad, man. Hey! All right, now settle down! Turn that damn thing off! Now, y'all got a new student-teacher starting today, and I want you to show him a little bit more respect than the last one.
