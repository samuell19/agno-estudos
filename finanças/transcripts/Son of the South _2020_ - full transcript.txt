That's me, Bob Zellner, the one in between. You've got to keep the white and the Black separate. The South was in an uproar over the Civil Rights Movement In my town, Montgomery, Alabama, five years ago, there was a bus boycott which began with the arrest of Mrs. Rosa Parks for not giving up her seat to a white man. We walk with God. If we have to walk for a year, we'll walk until those buses are no longer segregated. That's what happened. They walked for a year and they won. Some of my people got pretty ticked off about that. Have no fear. The Right and the white will win. And last year was the sit-ins to desegregate lunch counters all across the South. As you can see, a lot of white folks had a short fuse when it came to the Civil Rights Movement. Here he is. This group, the spark that lit their fuse was a college paper I got assigned to do with four of my friends, a paper on race relations. That's what could get you killed. A senior paper. Five months ago, life was simpler. Come on, baby. Let's twist. Wait a minute. Are you even old enough to drink? What is this you got growing right here? Got dirt on your face? What is it? You know, boys, I happen to think that it looks pretty good. You know, I got a cat back in Mississippi. I could lick that off for you. Whoa, whoa, look out, ladies and gentlemen, we've got a genuine bona fide scholar. How does a dumb country boy like you end up at top of the class? Hey, school has her favorites. You should be ashamed of yourself. To Bob. Free, white, 21. I'm not 21 anymore. Come on, Bob. Let's dance. - Carol Ann. - Come on. Not exactly free, neither. Boys, look, at his dancing. He's definitely white. Okay. Okay, that's far enough. - What? - We have to stop. Okay. You're right. You promised. It won't be long till we're married. We just have to be strong. How do you think she did it? - Who? - Joan of Arc. She wasn't normal. She didn't think about sex. No, not, not that. She was up against everybody and they burned her at the stake. She was a little crazy. She heard voices. They told her what to do. What do your voices tell you, Bob? Do they say, "Get your skinny little white butt to that Black church? Or do they say, "Get back in line there, boy? "The hell do you think you're doing?" I already told you. There's no way. But all we wanna do is audit one of their meetings. Bob, you can't go to one of their meetings. The Montgomery Improvement Association is one of the most active civic groups here. And Miss Rosa Parks is in town for one of their celebrations. I forbid this. You cannot meet with Rosa Parks or any of them. Really? No Black people for a paper on race relations? I just didn't see how we could eliminate one of the races the relations were about. Excuse me, Dr. Abernathy. My name is Bob Zellner. This is Townsend Ellis, John Hill, Joe Thomas and William Head. And we are college seniors working on our thesis on race relations. Do you all know Mrs. Parks? Of course. Yes. You all attend the Methodist College? Yes, ma'am. They sent you over to talk to us? Not exactly. Not exactly. I see. We were wondering if we could ask you a few questions about the Montgomery Improvement Association. Yeah. Well, that is a laudable endeavor. We can only hope that more students would be willing to tackle such an important subject. We were actually wondering if, with your permission, of course, we could come to the celebration at your church. You do understand the police might want to arrest you. Are you all willing to make that choice? It ain't anything like that. We're not trying to stir up trouble. Now, now, son. I'm starting to wonder if you are aware of the poison in the apple that you have bitten into. You met with him. Talked to him. Now you got what you want. Get the paper done. Hand it in. You know I'm German. I've seen the Brownshirts and the Hitler Youth. I've seen what people are capable of. You've got to protect yourself. I'm glad to see today that we are once again, blessed with the company of State Investigator Willy B. Painter and Officer Fuller. Today we have come together in the Brick-a-Day First Baptist Church. And I don't think the assembled would mind if I lend a welcoming hand and thank you for so lovingly recording our messages for Governor Patterson. - Amen. Mm-hmm. - Oh, yes. Oh, yes. And as long as the governor is now listening, I'd like to ask the governor if he is aware of the great economic strides made here in Montgomery since the success of the boycott five years ago. It appears that freedom is not only good for the Negro - in Montgomery... - That's right. ...but the white population benefits from it as well. And I'd like to tell the governor that we are glad to help. But please don't be alarmed. Yes, sir. The bus boycott was only the beginning. We intend to benefit Montgomery much more from now on. It appears the police have surrounded the church. What do they want? They've come to arrest you and your friends. For what? If I recollect, we had this conversation. They can't arrest us. The Montgomery Police Department might not do many things well, but arresting white boys for attending Black churches, they do extremely well. We're just doing research for a paper. Yeah. I mean, we haven't chosen any sides here. I'm not so sure the powers that be will so readily agree. Please. We gotta get out of this some way. There's a back door to the church. I'll go out front and draw everybody's attention around there. Y'all, come on. John. Eugene. Y'all get up here a little closer. As you all are aware... Today we have come together to honor what became known as the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Come on. Thank you. Thank you. You know, there's gonna come a time when... something really bad happens right in front of you, and you're gonna have to decide which side you're on. Not choosing is a choice. Good. Good, Doc. Keep that guard up. Good job, buddy. - Yeah. - Good job. - Good work, Doc. Well done. - Thank you. Thanks. Hey, Bob, get in here. Don't worry about it. You're not gonna need that. Come on. I hear the school's gonna get you for leading some kind of Martin Luther Coon rally. What are you talking about, Coach? It's Reverend. I ain't your coach. Now, what Bob and I here are gonna demonstrate for you is the importance of keeping your guard up. - Oh! - You see? He let his guard down. Put your hands up, boy. What's that about? You can't take it? What, you don't know how to hit back? I can hit back. Hey! The niggers are making you soft. You can't at least try to fight back? I'll try anything three times. Hey! How's that, Reverend? - Is that soft enough for you? - Hey, hey! Back off. Jesus! What the hell you doing? He's an old man. You could kill him. Okay. Come on. Come on. As the duly elected Attorney General of the great State of Alabama, I look at you and I ask myself what makes five young, upstanding Southern scholars like yourselves go march and sit in and demonstrate and generally disrupt the peace? Excuse me, son. You have to speak up. We never did any of that. March, sit in, demonstrate. You have fallen under the influence of the communists. There's communists in Alabama? Well, no. But they come through here. I'm gonna read you a list of names and I want you to tell me which ones you've met with. Virginia and Clifford Durr, Anne and Carl Braden, Aubrey Williams. Do you know these individuals? - No. - No, sir, I don't. None of them are in Alabama? Well, the Durrs are here. Now you boys are being expelled. - What? - Asked to leave. All right. Asked to leave. For the sake of the college, we have negotiated a resolution. You will not be charged with any crimes if you resign from school and leave the city of Montgomery immediately. School has agreed to this. I think it's more than fair. I have no idea what crimes we've committed. So I see no crime for which we could be charged. There are two members of this group who have achieved the highest scholastic honors given by this institution. Now, this close to graduation, I will not voluntarily leave. I think you're making a mistake there, son. Look at there. This is what this was all about, wasn't it? You're a big man now. You're on the front page. You think I put us in the paper? You don't care who you ruined. Townsend, I never called the paper. I swear. I just can't imagine why everybody's drawers are in an uproar. We're in Alabama. But don't you think this is its own shade of crazy? I mean, what the hell do we do? You did what you did and drug me and John in it with you. And what did I do, Townsend? Exactly what did I do? You know, for a big boy, you sure are shit scared of your own shadow sometimes. Hey, Zellner. Ku Klux Klan's about to march on campus because of what you did. Professor Kleiner's got a whole bunch of boys down yonder. Come on, man, we gotta go. Shit's about to hit the fan. Those rowdies have been telling us to send the "nigger lovers" over. That's outta line, Bob, calling you a "nigger lover." That's all that happened? No, no, no. They tried to come on campus. They wanted to get all five of us. They called you sons of you know what. We told them you're definitely sons of you-know-what, but you're our sons of you-know-what. And no one's coming on campus to do anything to anybody. This ain't right. I'm gonna go straighten these boys out. Bobby! Grandaddy? Bobby, you're looking thin. Grandaddy, what are you doing out here? They figured out who was who and they called me down from Birmingham. They tell me you went to some, uh, nigger convention - or demonstration or something. - Wasn't anything like that. We're just doing a paper for our professor over there. So this is all about school work? - Is that what you're telling me? - Yeah. Did you burn that cross under our dorm room? Bob, you should know better than that. But I'm gonna tell you something. Some of these old boys around here, they really mean to do you some harm. It's good they didn't catch me alone. Do you think that professor saved you? Have enough of those boys that, they killed their share of Nazis back in the big one. I don't think one more dead Kraut would bother them very much. I stopped them, Bob. Daddy, Daddy, just hold it right there. It's all your fault. You know that, don't you? - That's my fault? - You're goddamn right, it is. Taught this boy right from wrong right from the get-go, he wouldn't have gotten himself into any trouble. I wouldn't have to be down here trying to get him out of it. So when did it become a capital offense to go to church? White or colored? I'm heading back up to Birmingham a little while. All right. Look around you, Townsend, we've got support. Nobody has to leave school. No, you got support, Bob. If the Klan or school touches a hair on your head, your daddy will show up with 20 liberal preachers to protect your skinny little ass. No offense, Mr. Zellner. I'm here for you too, son. It's a nice thought, sir, but it's not altogether true. The rest of us, we're leaving. We're going back to Mobile and Union Springs and Dothan. What do you think our families are gonna do when we get there? Gonna help pick out the limb the Klan's gonna hang us from. I know it looks scary from where you're standing right now. You got options, Bob. That's why in your head, this is just some big game. You do not have the commitment of someone like Rosa Parks. You're going off to some impressive school in the fall. - Full scholarship. - Yeah, and I worked hard for that. Yeah, so did I. Bob. Which one do you think you're gonna pick? - Yale? Princeton? - Harvard? You'll have a hell of a story to tell 'em when you get there. Excuse me. Virginia and Clifford Durr. This is where they live? Wow. Hello. You've reached the Durrs. Mrs. Durr, my name is Bob Zellner, and I'm a student over at Huntingdon College. Everybody, everybody, here he is! Mr. Bob Zellner of the illustrious Huntingdon farm. Bob, I am so glad you called. I'm Virginia. This is my... my husband, Clifford. - And you are? - I'm Carol Ann Dunlap, Bob's fiance. - Hello, Bob. - Mrs. Parks. Uh, and this is Aubrey Williams and his Yankee assistant for the summer, Mr. Derek Ang. - The Communist. - I know. - Where you from, Carol Ann? - Union Springs. Any relationship to Martin Dunlap? He's my grandaddy. Looks like you're moving up in the world, Mr. Zellner. Well, y'all sure are stirring up the Methodist wasp nest pretty good over there at the college. Well, they're doing all the stirring. We're just trying to stay out of the way. A bunch of hypocrites. They stripped his right to give the commencement speech. They'd like to kick him out altogether. You know, Clifford is an attorney. A lawyer? That's what they keep telling me. Sir, over and over, I get the feeling we broke the law. Because you did. - What law is that? - Mm. They broke the law that people don't have the rights to do anything the Ku Klux Klan doesn't want them to do. Bunch of cowards. We have fought far tougher enemies than them. We're still having so much trouble with all these silly, scared white men hiding under hoods. I just don't understand it. Well, if you understand the Southern mind... Clifford, I believe I have a Southern mind, and I believe I have an understanding of it. Everybody here, with the exception of Derek Ang, has a Southern mind. Even Bob knows he broke the law of the KKK. Bob's more like you, Mrs. Parks, when you refused to get up from your seat. He didn't think all this was gonna lead to anything. Yeah, I was just a poor little seamstress tired from her day. Am I missing something? Are you saying... you knew what you were doing? You think I am a child? We had to change the bus laws. Therefore, somebody had to refuse to get up. You knew, getting on that bus, that you were gonna get arrested. Well, not that particular bus and... I wasn't sure I'd ever do it, but still... pretty interested to see what rights I had or not. A lot of it was worked out at Highlander. I read that Tennessee is trying to shut the school down. - Oh, again? - Highlander? It's a center where people, Black and white, from all across the South come to work and study political action together. And you've been up there? Oh, we've all been. That's right. I really did know what I was doing. Maybe you'll be up there soon. I'm sorry, but I won't be going anywhere but up north for graduate school in the fall. Is that so important for you to do it right away? Yes, ma'am, it is. I mean, most of my family didn't even make it through high school. So getting to go off on a full scholarship to get a masters is a pretty big deal. He has already jeopardized that once. When we read about you in the papers, we thought we'd found somebody. Find somebody like who? We have a need for somebody like Bob, somebody who could speak to other white students throughout the South. I'm sure that's needed, but we do have plans and none of them include Bob ending up in jail. Things have got to change, Bob. Mm-hm. - I know you know that. I think we both know that things have to change, don't we, Carol Ann? But maybe there's a better way. Without risking too much? Maybe. I mean, we do live in a democracy. It's a republic, actually, which is what Germany was when Hitler rose to power. In 1939, in Nazi Germany, they had a law that said all the Jews were supposed to pack up their bags and get down to the train depot. Now that seems like a pretty good law to break, wouldn't you say? Where are you from? I'm from New York. But if you're looking for somewhere more exotic, my family came over from California. Well, what are you doing all the way down here? Trying to find out where they buried freedom, brother. What are you doing here? Well, that woman was a handful. How arrogant to decide the fate of people you never even met. We had our lives all planned out for us in there. I did something with somebody once. What are you talking about? I got in the wrong car one day, and... we went nigger knocking. Ooh! You got her. Yeah, but the sumbitches just broke my stick. Yeah, but what do you expect? That ain't a real nigger-knocking stick. We got a bat in the back. Boys, do you see it? You can hardly hit 'em with this. Yeah, but when you do... Lookie there. Skeeter, get that bat. Get that, boy. Get him. Ah! You missed him. - But he fell. - Yeah, well, you still missed him. See that coon up there, Bob? - Yeah, I see him. - I want you to get him. I don't know about this. You don't know? What's there to know? About this sort of thing. Hey, this is in your blood. All right? This is where you belong, boy. You grab that bat and you do what's right. Bob, you gotta do this. I don't think so. Skeeter, you told me he was the right kind of guy. Is he? Is he the right kind of guy? Bob. Take the goddamn bat. Take it. You don't get that nigger, we're gonna use that bat on you. How bad did you hurt that kid? Bad. Hey! Hey! Need some help? You look like you need some help. What's your game? No game. Just being friendly. I know you from somewhere? I-I don't think so. I got a bike with a basket on it though. I see. What happened to your arm? I fell. I should've told him it was me. I should have apologized, but it's... hard to explain to a perfect stranger why you do something as senseless as that. I don't even know why I did it. I was just... scared, I guess, but... looking at that boy... I wish it was me they had beaten with that bat. We will continue our Freedom Ride from Birmingham and onto Montgomery. And from there, we plan to travel all the way to New Orleans with a stop in Jackson, Mississippi. And do you expect the authorities in these cities to allow that? Uh, I'm not certain about the local authorities. We are testing the resolve of the federal government to enforce the Interstate Commerce Commission ruling, which gives each and every American citizen the right to use the facilities equally. Aren't you concerned that they'll burn this bus the same way they burned one in Anniston just two days ago? Acting like he's as good as me. Well, I didn't take care of the yellow bastards in Korea to be pushed around by the Black ones back here. Weren't you a medic, Doc? Yes, I was. And I even saved some of those Black sons of guns when they got themselves shot up. Drug one, must have been 200 pounds, the length of a football field. Bullets whizzing all around our heads. Yeah, you do crazy things in war. But we are not in the war now. How do you feel generally about Freedom Riders and groups like that? I think they're just asking for trouble. It's not gonna last too long before the people down here get a little antagonized with it, and they're gonna take it into their own hands. I just think we ought to have open season on all of 'em. Freedom Riders are waiting for a bus to take them to their next stop, Montgomery, Alabama. Where are you going? Are they crazy? Montgomery's gonna make Anniston look like a Sunday go-to meeting. We already set up to create as much protection as possible for them when they arrive. You got guns? We're gonna meet the bus and get everybody into automobiles into safety just as quick as possible. I was hoping that you might wanna volunteer. You must think I've lost my mind. I'm going to go down and meet 'em when they get here. You think you're invisible? All those folks down there are gonna see is dark hair and dark skin, and they're gonna think that you're a Freedom Rider. We could use you, Bob. You see the TV? What would give somebody the courage to put their butts in the frying pan like that? I couldn't do it. Derek... Why are you really down here? It's like you said. Black hair, darker skin. My family got brought over here as labor too, you know. Well, yeah, but they weren't slaves. Of course not. I'm fourth-generation American. Still, when I was a kid during the war, my parents got me to wear this sign every day. It said, "I am Chinese." That's strange. Not really. They didn't want me to get arrested or get beaten up for being Japanese. The sign. Scared the hell out of me. Want to know what's really messed up, though? I was just so glad. So glad I wasn't Japanese. Them, not me. Them, not me. The Greyhound bus company has finally agreed to provide a driver and a bus to carry the Freedom Riders from Birmingham to Montgomery. They'll be escorted along the way by Alabama State troopers, led by Floyd Mann. They should be arriving in Montgomery soon. - Shoot. It's your nickel. - Bob, the Freedom Riders have already left from Birmingham. I'm down at Clifford's office. Can you pick up Derek at my house? You know, I never said I was gonna go down there to get anybody. Why? Well, what's the matter? Well, I got the habit of breathing, and I don't really feel like giving it up too soon. So you don't care what happens to them? This was their choosing. Okay, I get it. Give me your keys. All right, simmer down. - I'll get you close. - All right. - Are they here yet? - They're here. Where's that police car going? God, this doesn't look right. Maybe it's early. - John Lewis! - Excuse me, John Lewis! Mr. Lewis, please. We have some questions. How can you possibly succeed with so few of you? Non-violence. ...be overcome by violence... Freedom Riders have landed on the shores of Montgomery. And at this very moment, they're at the bus depot with their white cohorts right there with them, not white Americans but Red Army commies sent here directly by the Kremlin. - Get us outta here. - I can't drive her. - These people will tear me apart. - You can't leave us here. It'll look like I'm hitting her with nothing but a purse. They have arrived with weapons, that I know. They are armed to the teeth. So take whatever you can grab, bats, chains, sticks and bricks, get down there, and stop these commies in their tracks. Please! Please! Stop it! Hey! Don't! Please! Please! I bet you ain't happy you came to Montgomery, now, boy. - Sweet Jesus! - Oh! We don't know what happened, but you're finally here. Thank God. Bob, you see that woman in the pink dress? Her name is Jessica Mitford. Can you try and get her? Okay. Wait. Where are you going? If you're going, I'm going. What? I'm only doing this once. Hey, you all right? Hey, are you... Are you Jessica Mitford? - Who wants to know? - I don't think it's the best place to... What do you think? That you and your bullies here are gonna frighten me? I have seen... Let go of me this instant. Hey, I'm the press. Esquire magazine. Virginia sent me. She's right up there. Can you just walk away from me this instant? Virginia Durr! - Who are you? - Someone trying to keep you from getting your head busted. Now come on! Get in. Let's go! - Are you okay? - I can't believe you sent that young man to rescue me. I was completely fine. Slightest danger at all. You know, there are some young girls out there. Ran into that building, the one with the horribly reproduced Greek facade. Courthouse? They... They need some help. Bob? Well, hop to it. Go on. This is a formal injunction. I'm reading you the riot act. Forbidding persons named and unnamed... This is a hearse. There'll be no killing here today. This is over. Floyd Mann, you ain't supposed to be here. We are not having a discussion here. The next shot I fire will not be a warning. ...in the State of Alabama, to engage in the so-called Freedom Ride and other acts or conduct calculated to promote breaches of the peace. Hey! No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm here to get you. To get you out. But... We gotta skedaddle. Come on. - I'm Bob. - Very nice to meet you, Bob. Joanne. And behind you, Susan. - Hi. - How you doing? You can put me down now. Oh, yup. All right. We're rolling. Anytime you're ready, son. That's Jim. - Segregation must be... - Oh, my Lord. ...stopped. Must be broken down. Those of us... who were on the Freedom Ride... will continue to Freedom Ride. I'm not sure I'll be able to. But we're going on to New Orleans, no matter what happens. We're dedicated to this. We'll take hitting, we'll take beating. We're willing to accept death. But we're going to keep coming until we can ride from... anywhere in the South to any place else in the South... without anybody... making any comments. Just as American citizens. - Where are you going? - I need to borrow your car. - But where are you going? - To the hospital. All right, well, I'm driving. - We should go too. - I don't think so. So what's gonna happen next? We continue on. With the Freedom Ride? All the way to New Orleans. But yours is over at least. What are you talking about? Well, look at you. Freedom Ride is over. But we're still breathing. They got Jim Zwerg up in that white ward and I don't think he'll be coming, but we are getting back on that bus tomorrow. That's crazy. Yeah, you know what Mississippi is like? No. What's it like? After getting criticized for being backwards, people from Georgia say, "Thank God for Alabama." And in Alabama, we say, "Thank God for Mississippi." So you think it's gonna be rough? Suicide. Yeah. Yeah. You're probably right. But John and I are getting back on that bus. Is our cause just? If so, then you must ask yourself, "If not now, when? "If not me, then who?" Thank you, fellas, for coming down. It means a lot. ♪ I'm taking a ride ♪ On the Greyhound bus line ♪ I'm riding the front seat ♪ To Jackson this time ♪ Hallelujah ♪ I'm traveling ♪ Hallelujah ♪ Ain't it fine? ♪ Hallelujah ♪ I'm traveling down freedom's main line ♪ Gentlemen. In Montgomery, an angry white mob is holding over a thousand people inside the First Baptist Church, where they've come to listen to speakers such as the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth of Birmingham. The most guilty man in this state tonight is Governor John Patterson. The people of Alabama are law-abiding citizens. Uh, these people that came into Alabama, uh, were law violators. They created the breaches of the peace and provoked the local people into disturbances. US Attorney General Robert Kennedy has engaged us and assured us that he has the National Guard coming here to the Brick-a-Day Church now. We must remain where we are until they get here to protect. And despite what took place at the bus depot earlier, despite the angry crowd that surrounds us, we must remain nonviolent. Now, I know some of y'all think you wanna strike back, that you might wanna go blow-for-blow. But we cannot, - and we have to restrain others from doing so. - Yes, yeah. We hold the moral high ground. Yeah. And we intend to keep that high ground, if ever we hope to transform America into a better place. - Oh, yeah. - Amen. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. - It's beautiful down here. - Yeah. Montgomery's a pretty town. With a pretty ugly side to it. Yeah. Well. that's probably true everywhere. It's certainly true in Nashville. Virginia gave me this. Found it inside. Do you mind? I was an Eagle Scout. I got a merit badge in first aid. Oh, all right then. As long as you've got a merit badge. Before today, I'd never touched a Southern white person before. And none ever touched me. How's that even possible? My father's a professor of advanced mathematics. I grew up on campus, all Black school. I did study in Paris, though. There were all sorts of white people there. But they were different. There were more French than white. Nobody's ever called me a nigger until I started sitting-in in the lunch counters in Nashville last year. Take your Black ass off my stool! You know what I thought then? "No, they must be joking. "Don't they know who I am? "I'm an associate professor. I speak five languages." - How many you speak? - Five. Wow. Can I ask you something? I've been told that down here, white folks' hair smells like chicken feathers when it gets wet. - Is that so? - They told you what? Can I smell your chicken-feathered hair? Just to see. I guess you better wet it first. Okay. Oh! What is that? You smell like my cousin Elroy. Oh, yeah. He probably uses Burma Shave. Mm. - Bob! - Carol Ann! Is this where you've been all day? No, I was... I was downtown. - In the riot? - Yeah. You cannot believe what went down there. And who is this? Carol Ann, Joanne. Joanne, this is... Can you excuse us a moment? What was she doing back there? She just wanted to smell my hair. - For what reason? - Just see if I smelled like a chicken. Look, Carol Ann, these are the craziest human beings I think I've ever met. They're actually planning on getting back on the bus to go on to Mississippi. It's like they're running a three-legged dog. They think they're gonna beat the pack. They are something. So what is it you're telling me? You wanna go get on a Greyhound with these people so some old redneck can beat the hell out of you? No, I'm not saying that. I'm... I'm just telling you, I admire 'em. Yeah, it's admirable. Now, let's go get back to campus. Not tonight. Oh, no, Carol Ann. Don't go thinking that. Do not get all caught up. You will ruin our lives if you get caught up in this. I know. You're scaring me, Bob. It was incredible. Amazing. One of the most exhilarating experiences of my entire existence. You really shouldn't have missed it. - You want a coffee? - Marvelous idea. Black. Get him one too. Dear girl, how did you get back? I didn't hear my car drive up. I have a little Nash Rambler back in California. I can drive it here for you. - Why would you do that? - The brakes are good. The real problem is just getting it started. What are you talking about? Where is my car? They burned it, all right? We did everything. Everything we could to stop them, didn't we, Dickie? You parked right in front of the church. I told you to park three or four blocks away. You did! You did, darling. I know you did... I'm glad you're in one piece. It's just that Clifford is gonna wanna kill you. They're taking the bus down to Jackson, Mississippi, later. - They're leaving today? - Who's leaving? Those who aren't too badly hurt. And a handful of volunteers to take the place of the others. Did somebody volunteer for me? I think so, yeah. Well, nobody needs to take my place. Were they from Montgomery? Mostly. A reporter took everybody's name down who's riding. I gotta get some sleep. Hold on to this for me. Virginia, I think I found a picture of your car. - Derek Ang. - He's one of the volunteers. Sweet Lord Jesus. Put everything back, Bob. You're not going anywhere! - Okay! - I don't have to tell you that this is crazy! - This is crazy! - Yep. You're right. I forbid this. Do not walk out that door! You stop right now! I am talking to you. Bob! Put down that suitcase. I'm warning you, Bob. You go down to that bus depot and you get on that bus, and we are over! Done! - We're done? - Your decision. Well, in that case, I'll try and be back in a few days. Bob! - I want to get on that bus. - Mm-mm. Uh-uh. Jackson citizens watched by the hundreds, jostling each other for a better view. The Freedom Riders stepped off the bus, some still bearing the bandages of their encounter with Alabama. A policeman ordered them to move on. Then each was arrested and led outside to a waiting paddy wagon. The charges were breach of the peace and inciting to riot. The trial was short. The sentence... Leave it alone. ...which was suspended. The Real McCoys is about to come on. That's my favorite show. And I'll break your arm if you touch that TV. Well, you really are something, Bob. You know that? Carol Ann. That could have been you. I'm glad you decided to come to your senses. I didn't. Bus was leaving by the time I got there, and they wouldn't let me through. You really meant to go off and get yourself arrested? You know what I felt when I saw I couldn't get on that bus? Relieved. My head was saying, "Thank God. "Thank God. Thank you, Jesus." That's right. Thank you, Jesus. What do you think Jesus would have done in my place? You are not Jesus, Bob. You got that right. That's John Lewis. That man right there. You see him? Virginia Durr told me he's a minister. He doesn't look old enough, does he? Well, he's the first real man of God I think I've ever met. Oh, so he's Jesus? No, he's a man. But me, I was afraid to get on that bus. - What does that make me? - Reasonable. I was in a riot two days ago, and I walked right through it unharmed. And I know why. It's 'cause I'm just like everybody else. You know what I think most of the time? "It ain't happening to me. So it's okay." It should be my motto, just get it tattooed on my body someplace. - "Not my problem." - What is the point you're trying to make? I'm gonna go call these people up right now. Find out what they're really about. And I know that you're not gonna like that, but that's what I'm gonna do. Well, if that's all you do, it's okay. I'm not asking your permission, Carol Ann. And that's just it. I'm capable of doing a lot of things you're not gonna approve of. I am trying to preserve the life we've been planning together. Is that at all meaningful to you? I think about it constantly. There's a voice in my head saying, "Get back in line, you dumb ass country boy." So what is it you want to do? You wanna go off, get yourself arrested, jeopardize your whole life for some grand principle? Isn't that what they're doing? I mean, they're my age! Half of them are in college too. So how is it that they can do it? And what about me? You wanna give me up too? No, I don't. I just, I got to do something and I don't see you putting up with that. You had me fooled for a long time, Bob Zellner. I really thought you were gonna be somebody. I thought you had ambition. But you are nothing but a dumb ass country boy. And maybe it's all right for you to end up living life in a shotgun shack, trying to save the world. But that has never been my dream. Who do you think you are, anyway? We both know you're not anybody's savior. Well, the niggers aren't on TV anymore, are they? This is The Real McCoys. Starring Walter Brennan, created by Irving Pincus... Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. - Yes, is this the SNCC office? - Yes, it is. We'd like to thank you, Father, for this blessed meal you've set before us. I'm calling from Alabama. I was wondering if you needed volunteers for the summer. We'd like to ask that you keep an eye on our second eldest, Bob, who's leaving to take up arms and to fight for freedom and justice. We could use you. How soon can you get over here? I can be there in a few days. You know our son, Lord, I'm sure that you know that he is headstrong, a fighter, and resolute. First of all, Lord, he is righteous. Please walk with him and keep him safe. Amen. Amen. Bob, darling, take care of yourself. I mean, there's no reason for you to go out of your way to get in trouble. Going away to school in a few weeks. Remember that. - Okay? - What's going on here? You're acting like I'm going off to war. I'm sorry I wasn't there at graduation. I just couldn't go. I couldn't face it. Hey, Bob, you start applying for work as a nigger-lover yet? Now, what's that all about? You still up to something? Nah, they're just fooling around. Calling you a nigger-lover, is just fooling around? Don't listen to them, son. They're white trash. It means nothing, Daddy. You know how people are. Listen, I don't wanna find out that my grandson is trying to help the niggers take over. Not that you would tell me about it. It was supposed to mark the beginning of our life together, truly together. And I can see now it was really marking the end. Mama wants me back in Union Springs, and I'm going back for now. Don't come to find me. I don't want to see you. I hope you find your way when you get out there. I'm leaving today. I think. I'll let you know if I get on that bus. Bye. Bob Zellner. You're the phone call from Alabama? Yes, sir. The volunteer? You expecting somebody else? You know, I gotta admit, I was. You know what we do here? You're a freedom organization. And you're Southern? Alabama born and raised. All right, Alabama. Well, listen. I gotta catch a bus. Here are the keys to the office. Notepad, pencil. Most important thing. Guard this briefcase. Never let it out of your sight. When you leave, take it with you. I'll guard it with my life. You don't have to do all that, but don't lose it. Everything's in there. You better be on the up and up, Alabama. Oh, uh... sorry... what am I supposed to do? Well, you open up the office around 8:00 a.m., stay until about 5:30, and in between, you answer the phones. - Okay. - You take all the phone messages. Who's calling, who they're calling for, and what they want. Um, what about the briefcase? Just keep it with you. When somebody comes, they'll know what to do with it. - Well, who's coming? - I don't know. - Well, when are you gonna be back? - I won't be. - McDew? - Uh, I think McDew just left. - Oh, who is this? - Bob Zellner. From where? East Brewton, Alabama. Uh, I don't wanna insult you, but, uh... - You sound white. - I get that a lot. All right, I... I got a message for Bob Moses. - Um, you think you could... - Go ahead. Um... Uh, Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. Bob Zellner speaking. Who is this? Bob Zellner. Did I call the right number? This is the SNCC office, right? Yes, it is. Don't move. Burma Shave! - Hey, Joanne. - What in God's creation are you doing here? America's favorite family comedy, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet. Hey, how do you like your new room? It's a lot better than the Y. - You play? - Do you? Because I'm a Negro, I shouldn't know how to play chess? I didn't mean it like that. Oh, because I'm a girl. I get it. Sit down. I'm gonna let you know, I'm pretty good. Uh-huh. We'll see. ♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪ You know, this movement is about more than just voting rights and being able to eat at Woolworths. Check. Don't go easy on me. You don't have to worry about that. Check. Look, we're trying to change the world, Bob. Have you read Jean-Paul Sartre? No. Never heard of him. Well, you've got a lot of studying to do. - Checkmate. - Yeah. Wanna go again? Well, it is getting pretty late. Chicken hair, are you getting chicken? Oh, don't be a sore loser. - SNCC office. - Bob! - Grandaddy? - I'm downstairs, god damn it! - Grandaddy? - Hey. Is there a place where a white man can go and sit down around here? There's a park. Park? Good idea. But he told me you've gone nigger crazy. He saw you with a Negress walking down the street. I'm just helping some people out for the summer. Ah, let's call a spade a spade. They're called niggers. With your delicate sensibilities you want me to call them, what, Negroes? Whatever you choose. Bob, I've known Negroes all my life. I got nothing against them. Now, you might think because I'm in the Klan, I'm against the Negro. I'm not against the Negro. I'm for the white race, that's all. As any decent white man should be. Hell, you know history. History teaches us the white race pulled humanity out of the muck and gave the world civilization. Hell, they don't understand civilization. Not them. Not their fault. Christ, they're barely out of the jungle themselves. A couple of hundred years. That's why we just, we can't mix in with them. Hell, I don't want to, anyway. I don't want to sit with them. I don't want to eat with them. I don't want to pray with them or ride on the goddamn train. I prefer not even to see them. That's my cross to bear, I guess. It's a colored organization. I work for 'em. It's called the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. But what the hell do you hope to accomplish with that? Eating, sitting, praying, riding trains together. The whole kit and caboodle. The Southern way of life, you just throw that away and just stomp that into the ground, right? It's gonna happen, Grandaddy. I've met the people changing everything, and they're... you can't stop them. They are tougher, they are stronger, they're more resilient, and they're right. You trying to tell me that the Klan can't beat a few niggers back into line? Hey, hell. That's hardly even gonna be a fight. I wouldn't count on that. They're gonna bury Jim Crow. The only funerals are gonna be for these... these commie niggers. And to tell you the truth, son, you're on that slippery slope yourself. I'm really only here to tell you something, Bob. I need to tell you this face-to-face, man-to-man. You come to Birmingham to march, protesting, sit-in in a bus depot, I'll put a bullet through your head my own damn self. You understand me? Huh? You've fallen off the path, son. We got eyes on you, Bob. We got eyes on you, god damn it. Got it? - Hey. - Hi. Well, are you gonna introduce us? Joanne, this is my grandfather. Grandaddy, this is Joanne. Certainly nice to meet you. What am I looking at here, Bob? We better go. I'll tell Daddy you said hi. SNCC office. Bob Zellner here. Well, yeah. All right. Mr. Zellner, this is Mr. Herbert Lee from McComb, Mississippi. Well, I know you're not calling for me. Would you like to leave a message? Well, yes, I would. I'm trying to find Bob Moses. Uh, he's helping us with voting registration over here. He's supposed to be back last week and I hadn't heard a thing from him. Would you know where he is? I wish I did. Everybody's calling for him. And that's about all I can tell you. You sound kind of troubled, son. Everything all right? No, sir, it's not. Well, you know, this work can get rough sometimes. I've never done anything like this and I know that we don't know each other, but I just don't know what I'm doing here. I hear you, son. I hear you. I hear you. I'm bored to tears. Bored? It ain't anything like what it looks like in the papers, Mr. Lee. Oh. Mr. Lee, um, I gotta go. I'm sure this is costing you an arm and leg anyways, but I'll get your message to Bob Moses. Thank you, son. Um, I appreciate you. - You are? - Bob Zellner. East Brewton, Alabama. Okay. Bob Zellner, East Brewton, Alabama. I'm Jim Forman. Oh, shoot. Am I glad to see you. I got nothing but messages here. You've been taking messages? Yeah, that's about all I've been doing. - Well, how did you get in here? - He gave me the keys. Who in God's name gave you keys? McDew. I think McDew. He didn't tell me. I just gathered... No, don't say another word. This is June 22nd, 1961. This is Jim Forman. I'm here in the SNCC headquarters, Atlanta, Georgia, with Mr. Bob Zellner. From? East Brewton, Alabama. And East Brewton, is a pretty small place? Well, not so small you could spit across it. Can I assume that East Brewton, like much of Alabama, is segregated with a healthy share of racism? - Well, that and then some. - Okay, but not you? I don't think I understand the question. Okay, well, can you recall your earliest memories of race? - You know, I can. - Well, what was it? I was about four years old, shopping with my mother at a downtown store where everybody went. Mm-hmm. My mother just bought me a little water pistol. I spotted a fountain pretty close to my own height to go fill it up. And so I turn the lever for that water, get that little water pistol open, and just as I'm about to fill that thing up, a pair of hands grabs me from behind, turns me around. It was a woman, never seen her before in my life. Perfect stranger. She said to me... That water fountain's not for little white boys. You see that sign over there? That says "colored" and that sign over there, that says "white" and that's what you are. Don't let anybody catch you drinking out of the colored fountain. If you want a drink of water, just ask anybody to lift you up. Indoctrination. - Go along to get along. - Mm. So you really didn't have much to do with Black folks? Oh, yeah, I did. Yeah. The South is a funny place. You know, I worked in a general store. I waited on Black folks as I did white folks. There's not a whole lot of separation between the races there. There were definitely rules to abide by, though. What rules were those? I couldn't carry anything out to a Negro customer even if they were old and feeble, no matter how heavy it was. I could if there weren't any white people around. And, uh, I had to see to the white folks before seeing any of the Black customers, no matter how long they've been standing there, that sort of thing. So how is it that you are here, Bob Zellner, instead of out somewhere kicking Negro ass? That will be my daddy. I think, yeah. He's a minister, and he was in the Klan. Let me explain. My daddy went on a cultural exchange in the '30s to the Soviet Union. And he was there for a long time, and he was starting to get homesick, and one day, he hears that there's a Baptist gospel choir from Georgia performing at the same town that he was in. I can tell you I was pretty excited to see some folks from home. But when I got there... turns out that it was this Black choir. I was taken aback, but, uh, they started singing. It was one of the most beautiful sounds I'd ever heard. Afterwards, we started traveling together. We went all over that whole part of Russia. Bob, pretty soon a terrible thing happened. What was that? I went color blind. It hit me one evening that... I was ruined as a Klansman. I had to go back and tell my own daddy that. He didn't want anything to do with the Klan and their robes for the rest of his life. He had a robe and all? Several, for different occasions and such, I guess. And one day, my mother cut 'em all up and made shirts out of 'em for me and my brothers. Not... not this one. Just when I was younger. Yeah, this is from a catalog. Okay. Well... ...that'll be enough for now. Well, should we, uh, pack up, clean up, close up shop? - What's in the briefcase? - I don't know. I thought you'd know. Oh, really? How would I know? - What is all that? - Well, it's SNCC. That's the whole organization right here. The whole organization is in that briefcase? - How big is SNCC? - Counting you? Good night! So, what is it that you think you can do for SNCC? What I was thinking was, somehow I could be a liaison to college students. I know there's still a lot of people on the fence about the whole issue. And maybe I could go around college campuses, talking to students about the Negro cause. The what? The Negra cause. Well, for one thing, you better learn how to pronounce the word. - It's Negro. - Negra. - Negro. - Negra. No. Negro. What am I saying? What you're saying, "Ne-gruh." Okay. I'm gonna break it down for you. What is that? My knee. Right. How does a child get bigger? They grow. Now, put it together. Okay. Take your time. - Knee grow. - Once again. Negro. Right. I got it. Negro. Negro. Negro. Negro. - What did you say? - He's okay. He's with me. He's with you? He's trying to learn how to say something. And "Negro" is the word he's trying to learn to say? So what word was he using? We're not looking for any trouble. We were just having some coffee. Well, look at that. Your monkey speaks. - Did you just call me a monkey? - Deepest apologies, to the monkeys. Listen. I don't know you. You don't know me. Let's just keep it that way. The only way to that... is if you take this coffee... to go. Ah! What the hell? Bob. Bob! Settle down. You better put a leash on your redneck before it gets hurt, Jim. Reggie. Bob is a volunteer. We're recruiting from the Klan now? He's for real, Reggie. Oh, yeah, I can see that. Well, I was thinking of starting him on his non-violent training. Mm-hmm. He could use that. But you know what I see... when I look at Mr. Wonderbread here? I see FBI. Mm. Maybe some local fuzz. You think they're trying to infiltrate us by sending us a good old boy? That's about they speed. Look at him, sitting there just egging us on. Monkey see, monkey do. You know what monkeys are like? I know what monkeys are like. Oh, yeah. - Leon! Leon! - I can't do this! - Cool down. Cool down, baby. - I can't! No! - Cool down, baby. - I can't do this. No. - Cool down. - I can't do this. Cool down. Sit down. There you go. Sit down. All right? - I can't do this. - I know, I can see that. But, Leon, if you want to participate, this is what you're gonna have to learn. We ought to be fighting back. We ought to be killing the white sons of bitches! Listen, you can't kill all of 'em. And we'll be the ones that are getting killed. And then, we won't be able to change anything. I know it's hard. And I know that you want to strike back, but you gotta try this other thing. It can work. Gandhi defeated the British Empire and never... fired a shot. I just see red sometimes. Me too, brother. Me too. Uh, yeah? Come in. - Buonanotte. - What's that? "Good night" in Italian. Bonne nuit. French. Gute Nacht. German. Oyasuminasai. Japanese. Wow. - About today... - That was pretty rough. I guess I should probably go through that training too, huh? I bit a girl's hand my first time. - Dang. - I did. But the real deal is much worse. You should know that. I know. I was in a riot once, right there with you. But no one was throwing punches at your head, Bob. When they do, you think you're gonna throw punches back? Well, that's the whole point, not to, right? That is the point. But can you do that? What you drinking? Mai Tai cocktail. You wanna try? Shoot. I'll try anything three times. Well, you might not like it. This looks pretty good. I'm sorry. That's terrible. Oh, shoot. Did you really just do that? I'll get it. I'm in my birthday suit. - No, it's fine. I can... - Oh. - Sorry. - It's all right. Should we be doing this? Probably not. Oh. It all makes sense now. Old Bobby has just been sniffing around. - Slumming - Reggie. Born for this, right, Wonderbread? Because you certainly living the great Southern tradition. So you're telling me you didn't use the pool, not once? No. They make you wear trunks now to swim at the YMCA. What do you mean? Well, up until now, they wouldn't let you wear anything. You mean like butt naked? That's the only way you could swim in the Y. Yeah. That's why I didn't swim. I didn't have a trunk. - They killed Herbert Lee. - What? How did it happen? His white neighbor killed him. State legislator named E. H. Hurst... gunned him down... in the bright of day. I loved that nigger. And I hated I had to do what I had to do. He didn't leave me no choice. I mean, you can't just stand by and let 'em run all over you. No reason to feel bad for doing what you had to do. You know, I loaned him the money to buy his place. That's the thanks I get? Registering to vote. Just a damn ingrate. They didn't even arrest him, did they? Calling everyone to McComb. Bob Moses is there. So is McDew, half a dozen SNCC staffers. It'll be the first time we all in one place... to be able to have that SNCC staff meeting. - Bob? - Yeah. I'm there. We're gonna need your car. Dang it. It's so hot under here. Couldn't we have just got a sheet or something? Leon, you hear what this cracker just said? - Hmm? - He said he wants a sheet instead of them filthy blankets. Just like a white cat to feel more comfortable in a sheet. Oh, come on, Bobby. That was funny. We've got to watch this one. That's for sure. - For sure. - I got to sit up. - Oh, whoa, whoa! - No, no, no, no. We ain't gonna let no cracker cop see us riding with a white boy like you. - I'm gonna melt. - You gotta suffer for the cause, baby. You gotta suffer for the cause. Since Herbert Lee's murder, there have been a number of actions by high school students in McComb organized by brother Bob Moses here. Three of these students were arrested sitting at a lunch counter at the five and dime on the square. They're being released today, but I've just been informed that there will be an assembly held at the high school at which the principal will be addressing the student body on these three students. Now we're expecting a... ♪ We've done all you wanted ♪ We've done all you want, Lord ♪ We've done All you wanted... ♪ Hey. What is it? They wouldn't let Brenda Travis back in. They're trying to send her to a reform school. The principal just caved. We're going to march on Magnolia. We wanna make some signs. Okay. Uh, Leon, Chuck, give them some papers. When they get up to go, you just stay back. It's crazy marching off like this without a plan. I shouldn't be involved in this. Everybody's gonna get thrown in jail and I can't get arrested. I gotta leave tomorrow. This is happening too quick. If I get busted, what's gonna happen to my mama and daddy? Everybody will find out back home, and there'll be hell to pay. Daddy will lose his church. If I'm a part of this, it will just cause more violence down here than normal. Really, Bob? What's a normal level of violence? You can lay back here with me if you want. You're not going? Somebody always has to stay back. So it's been decided. Reggie and I will hang here. Get people out of jail, that sort of thing? I'll hang with the march for a little bit, but at some point, I'll have to turn back. This isn't make-believe anymore, Bob. Things are gonna get real serious out there. Nobody here expects you to step out that door, lover boy. Anyway, you already got what you wanted. ♪ I woke up this morning With my mind ♪ Stayed on freedom ♪ I woke up this morning With my mind ♪ Stayed on freedom ♪ I woke up this morning With my mind ♪ Stayed on freedom ♪ Hallelu ♪ Hallelu ♪ Hallelujah ♪ I'm walking and talking With my mind Get your Black asses out of here! ♪ Stayed on freedom ♪ Keep it stayin' ♪ On freedom ♪ I'm walking and talking With my mind ♪ Stayed on freedom ♪ Hallelu, hallelu ♪ Hallelujah ♪ Son of a bitch.

I ain't never heard nobody speak no communist. Can you say something communist for me? Younger, shut up. But I ain't never heard nobody speak no communist before. You ain't got the sense God gave a billy goat. He always talk to you like that? Yeah, pretty much. Younger, I told you to button it. And stop talking to that goddamn New York Jew commie bastard. What do you know about New York, Jay-Jay? You ever been up there? No. And I don't plan to go neither. But I guess we'll be sending your remains back up there to somebody. My remains will be sent back to Alabama since that's where I'm from. - You're lying. - No. Daddy's a Methodist minister and I'm from East Brewton, Alabama. You're telling me you're from Alabama? We got cousins over in Dothan. That ain't far from Brewton. Maybe you know 'em. - Ethel... - Younger! We're not making friends here. Your daddy's a minister. Where did he go to seminary school? Bob Jones College. You ever heard of it? I heard of Bob Jones. - He's got a school? - Yeah, it's who I'm named after. I'm telling, y'all. I'm from Alabama. He sure sound like it. Does your mother know that you're doing this? She knows. You should be ashamed of yourself. A minister's boy too... named after Bob Jones and everything. Get him back in the car. There he is. Come on, Younger. - Where you going? - I'm out. - You... What's going on here? - This boy's from Alabama. Well, no shit. You already knew that? You gotta draw the line somewhere, Jay-Jay. And this boy here is way over it. Hey, Doc. Back in town, how come you didn't have the guts to step forward? Why don't you shut up, Bob? Bob? You know him? Oh, yeah. We went to school together. Go ahead. I'm warning you, boy. Tie him up. We about to hang a buddy of yours. That don't seem right. We are in crap right up to our necks. I'm out and I'm taking Younger with me. There ain't no reason to be out. Everybody has seen us take him. That don't matter. You sure about that? Did you know who everybody was downtown? I didn't. There was what looked like feds down there. Well, murder is a state charge. And you never saw the feds do anything to anybody else any other time. This ain't like any other time! When they give you all the chair for killing me, I guess it'll be justice for everybody else you killed. Nobody is getting the chair. He's from Alabama. You went to school with him. They're gonna give us the chair for sure. You knew his daddy's a minister? It... Nothing is gonna happen to us. Nothing's gonna happen to me 'cause I'm gone. You do what you want. Let's go. Feds will still get you for aiding and abetting, Jay-Jay. Okay! What the hell? I didn't give no goddamn signal! Cut the rope! Cut the goddamn rope. Holy Jesus and Mary. There was a civil rights march in McComb, Mississippi yesterday. Oh... How many people were hurt? And guess who they say led it? Twenty-two-year-old Robert Zellner. - That can't be right. - We better call somebody. Operator. I want to make a call to Alabama. Hey, there, Mr. Civil Rights leader. - Good morning. - How's your neck? Oh. My neck already had a tinge of red to it. Well... according to the New York paper, you, Mr. Robert Zellner, led the first civil rights march in the great state of Mississippi. It's the great state of Alabama. What did you say? Why would they write that? That's a lie. They looked out and saw a hundred Black folk and thought they couldn't possibly have the guts or brains to pull that off. And then they saw you and thought, "Oh, it all makes sense now." Man, I didn't mean to. No, well, you're famous now. But, as my mother always says, "Don't believe anything you read, only half of what you see." Yeah, right. You still plan on skipping town today? Reggie told me you have a bus to catch. - A bus? - Your friend from the bridge came by and burned your car. He did what? So, you think about coming down to visit for Thanksgiving or Christmas break? I have been considering it. Okay. Well, write me. You know, you could think about coming up for a visit as well. - I could think about that. - Don't think too long. And it won't hurt to take a language while you're up. Somebody said they saw you coming out here. I see you still enjoy the company of mongrels over men. Let it go, Bob. Your bus will be here in a minute. What the Black bitch says is true. Nothing down here is any of your business any which way. I just came by to remind you that if you do decide to come back, I got something waiting... - Bob... - Don't you say another damn thing. Hey! I just bought that. Don't get in between white folks arguing, you hear me? Ain't you supposed to be non-violent now? I'm having a real big problem with that right now 'cause what I want to do is pull you clean out of this truck and beat you like there's no tomorrow. I want to knock you into next week. I want the next face you see to be the emergency room doctor. But I don't think I'm gonna do that. You're a monster, Doc. You deserve no pity shown to you. But you know something else? I'm a goddamn monster too and I don't want to be one anymore. I don't want to be like every sucker I grew up with. See that woman over there? She's trying to teach me what it means to be a man. She says I should not beat you till your mama won't know ya. She says an eye for an eye leaves everybody blind. Well, I want to be more like her. I don't want to be the horror in some little child's eyes. Now, you drive off. Don't you turn around, don't you come back here with anybody 'cause if I ever see you again, I'm gonna forgive myself and I don't wanna do that. And not just 'cause she wouldn't like it but that would be enough. Can we agree on that? You missed your bus. Ah, no, that wasn't my bus. My nigger. What? My nigger! Yeah! Look at you go! I saw you. Oh, you were gonna get him, yeah! - Is that supposed to be a compliment? - Mm-hmm. Little bit. What are we, uh... What are we supposed to do now? We're gonna check on McDew and the others and see how they're doing in county jail. All right. Well, I guess I better go too, then. Oh! So you're gonna give this whole civil rights thing a try? Oh, you know me, I'll try anything three times. - Easy white boy, let's go. - All right. Come on. We think that in order to facilitate change, and in order to create the type of society that we think that we all basically want, that we have to take this sort of peaceful, non-violent direct action. How long will this group remain outside this locked door, Mr. Zellner? We'll stand here until we're able to reach some sort of agreement to open the restaurant. Attempt to stand here as long as we're able. Do you feel that your position is reasonable? I think so. And I think that it's the only way to do it. My philosophy is very simple. When you see something that is not right, not fair, not just, you have a moral obligation to say something, to do something, stand up, speak up, speak out.
