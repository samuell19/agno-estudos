I was there. I was there. We were there. At the dawn... ...of the third age. Of a new age. The birth of the Interstellar Alliance. A proud moment. A powerful moment. Delenn! Ah, damn it. -Delenn! -Yes, John. Have you seen my blue socks? There are plenty of socks right over there. Yeah. They're not blue. Yes, good point. The blue socks are my lucky socks. All socks are lucky socks, because at the rate you lose them, you're lucky to have any at all. You don't understand. These are the socks I wore when I took over Babylon 5. I thought it would be, you know, symbolic wearing them when I leave B5 to take over the Alliance. No one will know. I'll know. I can't go out there without 'em. Then what are your plans, Mr. President? To go sockless? No, of course not. Now, please. We need to go. They're waiting for us. I'm just saying, you shouldn't have challenged me. I'm not having this conversation. Delenn, he's not wearing any so-- Don't. Just don't. This is an Interstellar News Network special report. Two years after winning the Shadow War, Captain John Sheridan, President of the Interstellar Alliance, is leaving Babylon 5 for what many expect to be the last time. He is accompanied on this journey by his wife, former Minbari Ambassador Delenn, another veteran of the Shadow War, which began when the exploratory vessel Icarus awoke an advanced race, known as the Shadows, on their home world of Z'ha'dum. When they reactivated their war against the Vorlons, the conflict put Earth in the crosshairs and threatened to destroy dozens of worlds and kill trillions. When all else failed, Sheridan was able to end the war. Now get the hell out of our galaxy! Upon arriving on Minbar, Sheridan and Delenn will take up residence in the capital city of Tuzenor, which will serve as permanent home for the 12-world Alliance. The emotions of the moment show in his eyes as Sheridan bids farewell to the station where he served, now under the command of Captain Elizabeth Lochley. Godspeed, John. In preparing for this report, we repeatedly asked President Sheridan for an interview, only to be told that Sheridan is not big on the press these days. And-- Hello. Hello. Is this thing on? - John? - Over here. Why are you standing in the shadows? Got used to it, I guess. Are you having second thoughts about... well, about all this? Me? No. I passed second thoughts days ago. I'm up to 14 now. No, I'm just not sure if I'm cut out to be a politician, Delenn. I don't wanna spend my time doing ceremonial things, opening shopping malls, giving medals to people I don't like. Pardoning a turkey. Sorry? Thanksgiving. It's a big holiday back home. People celebrate by eating turkeys. But by tradition, one turkey always gets pardoned. It says much about your species that you have based an entire holiday on deciding not to kill something for a change. Anyway, I just wanted to let you know we'll be jumping out to Minbar soon. You should get ready. Mm. Copy that. Delenn... I'll admit, I'm a little nervous. But I know I'll get through it. Not because I'm the smartest guy or the best guy for the job. But because I know you believe in me. I don't need an Interstellar Alliance, I don't need the stars or any of the worlds spinning around them. I only need you, Delenn. You're my universe. The brightest star in my sky. I love you. I love you too. Now, get ready. Oh! And I brought you a present. Now get ready. Oh! And I brought you a present. Thank you for coming, Mr. President. I was told that Satai Delenn would be joining us. She's running behind, but she'll be here before we're finished. Ah! Good. Good. I trust you've settled in well these last few weeks? Yes, unpacked, found my blue socks, settled in, over the star-lag and generally, garden-variety peachy-keen. Excellent. We appreciate you doing this. I imagine that being asked to give your blessings to a new power system may seem trivial. No, no, no, no, not at all, Trudan. I like opening shopping malls. Uh, what's a shopping mall? It doesn't matter. What's important is that from what I've been told, this will provide power for the entire city of Tuzenor, at a fraction of the pollutants put out by the previous generators. I couldn't possibly be more excited. Thank you. Yes, thank you very much. This way, please. Thank you. Yes, thank you very much. This way, please. Huh... Uh, Mr. President, are you coming? Yeah. Right... Right behind you. A friend of mine once said that the future is all around us, waiting in moments of transition, to be born in moments of revelation. Surely, this is just such a moment, for Minbar and the Minbari people. I believe this is where we fire this baby up. Fire up... a baby? Find the "on" switch. A-ha. Yes, initiate phase one. The experimental process used by this new power system will be adopted by all member worlds of the Interstellar Alliance, and will be key to the advancement of several-- Initiate phase one. Key to the advancement of several civilizations on the brink of-- Initiate phase one. Phase two activated. Mr. President, are you all right? No, something's... Something's wrong. Oh, no! We should get help. Are you okay? Trudan, what kind of energy does this facility use? Oh, it was in the release. Nobody reads press releases! What's the damned energy source? Tach... Tachyons. Oh, crap. When we travel in time, we pass through great waves of Tachyon impulses. You can become unstuck in time unless there is anchor. These will keep you from drifting. Also, protect you. Time distortion can do terrible harm. You have to turn off the system. We can't. Once it starts, it cannot be terminated until it reaches full-- Then get me out of here before I-- Before you what? Lennier, get us out of here! - His stabilizer, it's hit! -John! No! What happened to him? Time stabilizer damaged. He is unstuck in time. Zathras warn, but no one listen to Zathras. What do you mean, unstuck in time? Where is he? In the past, in the future? Cannot say. Saying, I would know. Do not know, so cannot say. It's happening again. I'm coming unstuck in time. Is there anything I can do? Do you have a time stabilizer? A... A what? Yeah, I didn't think so. John! This way! Hurry! You better... run. -What? -Run! Run! No! No! Delenn! No! Stay back! Delenn! No! Run. Run! John! The hardest part of dealing with Pak'ma'ra, who, as you know, are carrion eaters, is the methane residue they leave behind, which can be-- Uh, can be-- Don't panic. Don't... Run, run, run, run, run, run! What? What? Nice setup. Sorry I kind of fried your classroom. Happens. You'd be surprised what goes down when you're dealing with alien medicine. So the university is very patient with me. I'm just glad to see you doing well. Getting the test results. Looks like your theory was right. Yeah, well, traveling in time, bright lights plus boom equals unstuck in time. How far did you say I jumped? Eighteen years since you left B5. Can I call me? Future me, I mean? That would be weird. "Hi, me, it's me." Might not be wise. Timeline issues could cause trouble. You said these flashbacks started when you left Babylon 5? Yes. Why? It's possible there could be a link. The time stabilizers came from the planet beneath B5. Epsilon 3, I know. So it's possible that moving outside the range of whatever tech Zathras used to moderate the Tachyon field began to wear off as you got farther away, reducing your stability in the time-stream. Then, when you got hit by the massive Tachyon flow at the power station-- Boom! Maybe a big boom. You see the tests also show that you're out of phase. Out of phase? Wow. That's bad. You don't have any idea what that means, do you? Not a clue. It means that the longer you stay out of your own timeline, the more you'll start sliding. Not just into the past and future, but even alternate realities, timelines and parallel worlds, like our reality in most ways, but different in others. So how do I fix it? Can I fix it? You have to get back to Babylon 5, then down to Epsilon 3. Find Zathras. Zathras? I'd rather be annihilated. John? Every time I even think about him, I get this pain behind my left eye. I think agitation might hasten the time-jumps. Ugh, now you tell me? John, listen to me. Quantum physics says, "The observer affects the observed." You might be able to find your way back by remembering exactly what you were thinking of when you disappeared from your timeline. Did you hear me? John! Did you hear me? What was that? -Garibaldi. -You okay? I'm fine. But you missed him. Damn it. Is he gonna be okay? I don't know. I don't know if any of us will be okay. But the worst is, I lied to him, Michael. I told him he jumped 18 years instead of 23. I couldn't bear to tell him that he died three years ago. Any idea where or when he's going? None at all. John? Dad? Should've told me you were coming. I could've made something special for dinner. I'm as surprised as you are. I like the beard. Thanks. I wasn't sure about it at first, but I think it grows on you. Most beards do. Where's Mom? Hmm. Went off to the store. Should be along anytime. Weird question... What's the date? January 17th. The year? Don't ask. Long story. 2258. Uh, why? The year I took over as CO at Babylon 5. A lifetime ago, I thought it was just a few weeks. Time's funny that way. I forget sometimes how much I love this place. Do you remember when you got lost in the cornfields? Some things you don't forget. Dad? I got turned around. Sun was straight overhead, no way to tell east from west. And I started to panic. Which only made the situation worse. Then I thought, "Okay, if panic doesn't help, maybe being calm will do something." I thought about you, and Mom. And how much I loved you, and this place, and it was like I could feel which way to go. And I did. I followed that feeling all the way home. For a long while after that, I'd go in once a week to get lost on purpose. Just to prove to myself that I could always find my way home. Hmm. Why'd you stop? Got tall enough to see past the corn. Perspective changes everything, I guess. There's your mom now. I better help her land. You know how she is on parallel parking. Won't she be surprised to see you? I love you, Dad. You know that, right? I love you both so much. Well, then I suppose we love you too, son. What the hell? Wha... Now where the hell am I? I can barely breathe. Icarus? "The Shadow War, which began when the exploratory vessel Icarus awoke an advanced race known as the Shadows on their home world of Z'ha'dum." No, no, no, no, no, no. Stop! What the-- Stop! Wait! How did you-- There's no time for that. You have to-- You have to-- Here, breathe. Who are you? What are you doing here? Doesn't matter. No time to waste. We thought we were the first. We are. Looks like we've got a claim jumper. The exploration team, where are they? They went down into the city, said they found a way inside some big structure. -Call them back. -What? Don't listen to him. It's a-- Call them back! Don't let them touch anything! We're inside. There's something here-- Get back to base! Right now! Who is this? It's too late. We're already deep inside. The walls. The walls are moving... and there's something behind them. We... We're not alone. They're coming toward us! They're... Too late. Has to be a light switch around here somewhere. "Where was Moses when the lights went out?" In the freaking dark. Gotcha! Babylon 5? I made it! Now all I have to do is go down to Epsilon 3 or get Zathras up here. Not sure which is more annoying. Okay, not good. ...civilians and ambassadorial staff first. Repeating, this is a general evacuation. All station personnel and residents report immediately to shuttle bays one through nine, civilians and ambassadorial staff first... What's going on? Where's Captain Lochley? Lochley? I don't know what you're talking about! We have to get out of here! They're coming through! If Lochley's not in charge, then who is? This is Commander Jeffrey Sinclair of Babylon 5. We are under attack and evacuating all hands. We urgently request assistance from any ships in this sector to pick up survivors. Long range comm systems destroyed. Did the distress signal get out? I think so. Keep resending on short range as long as we can. We need to get everyone off-station. Don't tell me. Tell them. Here they come. Form up! Alpha Squad, watch your six. Weapons aren't getting through. We need to get up close and personal. Follow me in! How much time do we have? Not much. Shadow vessels are taking us out three-to-one. We've got breaching pods all over the hull. If they break through to the shuttle bays before we finish getting everyone out of here... Then we have to make sure that doesn't happen. Garibaldi, meet me at Bay One. Bring anyone who's willing to stay behind. Copy that. -Jeff... -Don't worry about me. Do what you have to. Just get our people out of here. That means you too, Susan. Get to the shuttles. I'll run things from here. That's an order! Go! Everything ends. I'm not afraid. Bring it. This is Commander Jeffrey Sinclair of Babylon 5. We are under attack and evacuating all hands. We urgently request assistance from any ships in this sector to pick up survivors. This is Babylon 5. We are under attack and request assistance from any ships in this sector. Sir! We have an intruder! Whoever you are, you picked the wrong time to stow away. I'm not a... I'm Earthforce. Not the uniform. Retired. But-- Enemy is in blue sector. Thirty seconds. You've got 20 seconds, Mr.-- -Sheridan. -Use them well. I got hit by a Tachyon field, came unstuck in time and space. Fifteen seconds. I ran B5 during the Shadow War, but if you're in charge during all this, then this must be some kind of a alternate timeline. Doesn't matter. We have to get our people out or they'll end up just as dead in this timeline as they'd be in yours. -And so will you. -Yeah, I kind of figured. You know how to handle one of these? Of course I know how to. Do you know what a last stand is? Yes. Good. Because you just joined one. Since you fought these things before, is there any way we can stop them at close quarters? They're a million years ahead of us. Was that a no? That was a no. Here they come. Splash two. Good going, Alpha Seven. Let's make another pass. No! This is Babylon 5. We are under attack. We need ships to pick up survivors. Please. If you can hear my voice, we need help... to save them. They're coming through! Repeat, they're coming through. This is Earth Alliance Station Babylon 5. They're all over the place. They're killing us. Can anyone hear me? C and C... This is Bay Nine. The last shuttle is away. We got them out, but... No rescue ships in range. No ships. Jump gate destroyed. No one nearby who can pick up the shuttles. They'll be sitting ducks. If they die, we die. You die! Ivanova! Ivanova! Reply! I think she just did. Susan's right. Once the Shadows take the station, they'll turn around and destroy the shuttle, killing everyone before help can show up. Well, we can slow them down. But that's all. No. There is something else. The power core. Their ships are circling the station, right in the blast range. We blow the core, we can take out all of them and buy time for help to arrive. I know how to do it. So do I. Your people don't know who I am. They won't fight for me, but they'll fight for you. I'll get it done. We'll hold them off as long as we can. Nice guy. What was his name? Don't remember. Missed one. Damn it! I just hope the default admin codes are the same or I'm gonna look pretty stupid. Admin codes accepted. Override safety protocols. Confirmation required. Override all fusion reactor safeties? Confirmed. Activate destruct sequence. - Destruct sequence? - Yes. Are you feeling all right? I'm fine. This isn't just one of those, "I'm having a bad day" things? No. Just do it. Confirmed. Specify time-delay countdown to destruct. None. To ensure intentional destruct, final activation must be entered in correct sequence. You couldn't have put them a little closer together? We are all victims of our programming. I told you I had him in my sights. Freezing his neurons was quite unnecessary. Yeah, well, squeezing his brains made me feel a lot better about what's com-- I know what you're doing. How? I'm a telepath. I... You know me, or a version of me. Then you know I have to reach that switch. We will stand with you. Also, run with you. That too. Oh! Go! No. No, not now. The survivors, they have to get clear. Many of them are my people. Do not fear. We will get it done. Shall we? May as well. I missed the last shuttle out, and I am totally in a mood to blow some stuff up. G'Kar! Can you... Not like this. I think this is gonna take both of us. It has been an honor... to fight beside you. Ugh! Just help me pull the damn switch. Ah! Ah! What are you... doing here? I made it. I made it back to my own timeline. Made what? Aren't you supposed to be on Minbar? I have a lot to explain and not much time. So I'm gonna talk really fast and you're gonna fire up a shuttle. Right now! Um, can I get dressed first? Oh. Oh, sorry. I didn't... I... I didn't even... Right, right. I'll just wait in the other room, then. I'm all right. This is Captain Elizabeth Lochley, to anyone receiving on Epsilon 3. This is an emergency. We are on approach vector. President Sheridan is with me. Kindly do not shoot us down until we have had a chance to explain the situation. And don't shoot us down afterward. Basically just don't shoot us down, okay? What? No, shoot? Not today, pal. Nuts, fine. Retract. You know, I've never met Zathras before. I'm kind of excited by the idea. Yeah? Well, that won't last. Ah! Ah! There you are being! Hello, Zathras. No, not Zathras. Zathras. There are nine of them all named Zathras. Ah, ah, ah! Zathras. And you are the One! -Hi. I'm-- -Not the One. This way. Hurry. Can I hit him? Just once. Told you. Things change since first Zathras met the One. Now he is lost in time. And lost in sp-- Ah! Do not say. Even now, many issues with copyright. So there are still nine of you left, is that correct? Oh, no, no, no, no. Great Machine Replication System has been very busy. Behold... the Zathrii! Much greetings to the One! And some greetings to not the One. Shoot me. Shoot me now. You are in grave danger. Delenn! No! Run! Run! No! Not only is the One unstuck in time, and... the thing we cannot mention, you are moving between timelines, universes, realities. Yeah. That part I figured out. How is that dangerous? Not just to you, to everything. Quantum physics says, "Observer affects the observed." Particle is only particle when you are looking at it. Look away, it becomes a wave. Look back, it turns back into particle. So, like any relationship, particles can't commit. -She came with you, you know. -I needed a ride. Get to the point. Great Machine shows you are now quantum perspective. You are now observer. The more realities you see, the more that become real to you, the more they will collapse into each other, destroying each other as they try to become one. Soon, all worlds gone. All timelines gone. All realities gone. All universes gone. All Zathrii gone. Bad for Zathras. But all things bad for Zathras. You have heard of big bang? Yes. This will be big silence. The end of all. You know, I just came here for a time-stabilizer, right? Time-stabilizer not enough. Must stabilize you in time, space and reality. Requires big upgrade from Great Machine. Vast new technology. How long will this take? Ten minutes. This is why we call it Great Machine. Not so-so machine. Ah, Zathras make coffee while Zathras wait for Zathras. Why is it that most of the alternate realities I've been in so far have had something to do with the Shadow War? Quantum probabilities bend to your quantum perspective. Shadow War was great part of your life. You are drawn to what you feel. Drawn by your heart. Like my dad. Home. Babylon 5. My friends? Yes. Zathras has no friends. Only slow-moving insects and pocket lint. Here, Zathras show you. No, not so soon. Try to stay calm. Agitation makes jump faster. That thing. I saw it before. Following me. Stay back! Ah, no, stay calm. Try to hold on. Do not panic. Do not panic. It is... It is... No one listens to Zathras. Okay, definitely back on Earth. But where is everyone? Hello? Anyone there? Over here, Captain Sheridan. Out of uniform, I see. Good. Here, join us. I thought you were dead. Yeah, I get that a lot. Just one Centauri's opinion, but if this is you post-death, I must say it suits you. Last we heard, your shuttle was destroyed while trying to make contact with the Vorlons, in what I correctly said would be a futile attempt to talk them out of what's going to happen in... In what? Two minutes, 47 seconds. What's going to happen? Where'd everybody go? Depends on where they want to be at the end. Most of them are home, I expect. With loved ones or at other places that meant something to them in life. You know in churches, shopping malls, bowling alleys. Bars, casinos. We toured many of them in the last few hours, since we learned we could not leave the planet without being destroyed. "Go to Earth," the Centarum said. Make a deal. Perhaps there's a way you can save both our worlds. Idiots. Now I'm trapped here. But I suppose I had to try. Will someone here start making sense? He's in denial or shock. I don't blame him. Where is the bartender? Losing the Shadow War wasn't your fault, you know. You did everything you could. Even with the Vorlons, the odds were always against us. We... Wait. We lost the war? The Shadows won? Look, you can see a thought forming behind his eyes. Hello, little one. Good of you to join us. It's all alone in there, poor thing. Because the Vorlons were our allies, no one counted on them being the ones to finish us off. But it makes sense. For centuries here at home, losing armies burned crops and poisoned wells as they retreated to make sure the winners couldn't use them. The Shadow influence on Earth is significant. Hmph and the Vorlons are very sore losers. Destroying worlds that are sympathetic to the Shadows is a good move for them. For Centauri Prime, for Earth, for us, not so much. But it's an imperfect universe, yes. They're going to destroy Earth? And they're not even going to fire a shot. Apparently, they think you're not worth the bullet. At the moment, I concur. Right now, up there somewhere... a Vorlon planet killer is moving into position. It takes a lot of raw power to tear apart a planet as big as the Earth. So they decided to use something that will take less energy because it's only one-fourth the size... The Moon. Oh, my God, they're going to hit us with the Moon. Got it in one. Well, on the positive side, at least we have a good view of the show, eh, Sheridan? I said-- Stay! Stay back! Stay back! John! Well, there's something you don't see every day. What is it you humans say? Oh, yes. "Eight ball in the corner pocket." Ow. It's getting worse every time. Not sure how much longer I have before... What the hell is this? And where did the stars go? You look like someone in need of a friend, friend. G'Kar? If that is who you see, then, yes. So what is this place? The edge... of everything. On that side... nothingness. Silence, the void. On that side... everything. -The Rim. -One of many names for it. The last time I saw G'Kar, my G'Kar, he was heading for the Rim to find out what was on the other side. He did. Is he alive? Dead? He is as I am. As we are. And we wished to meet you at the Rim. On the precipice of the end of all things. If I'm that dangerous, why not kill me? That would go against the purpose of all this. Against the great experiment. Consciousness. Without that, there can be no purpose. If a universe springs into existence and no one is there to see it, to think about it, to give it meaning, does it really exist? This cannot be what it must be without someone to see it. Quantum physics, "The observer affects the observed." Without the observer, there cannot be the observed. That is the secret. The missing piece. For now, you are that observer. And if I die... Everything dies. Yes. The Minbari believed the universe is conscious. That it looks through us. So it can try and figure itself out. To give itself meaning. Yes, an infinity of eyes and minds and hearts, turned toward one singular question, one riddle to end all riddles, one word. Which is? "Why." They also believe that while the universe usually speaks through us at other times it takes a more direct approach. Do they? Do they really? Consciousness must make its own way, find its own path without interference. Only in this way can the child outshine the parent. If I intervene, the experiment is rendered meaningless, as am I. So I will say only this... In all realities, all universes, the everything of everything, there is no greater force than love. Tearing apart is easy. Destruction and hate are easy. Which is why they do not endure. What love knits together can never be torn asunder. The universe itself and all things within it bend to that power. As you say, "The observer affects the observed." And when that eye sees through love, everything is possible. That is all I came to say. I hope it is enough. But I have so many questions. And that is the glory and wonder of mortality. I can't take much more of this. Huh? Lennier. Lennier. I... Yes? I need you to help me. Of course. Because I don't feel so good. Water. What year is it? 147,923 by the Obadi calendar. No, not Minbari years. I'm in no shape to do the conversion. Same with Celsius and Fahrenheit. And why do we still have to use those anyway? Here, this will make you feel better. Yeah, I wouldn't bet on it. I should call security. I just need a moment. I'll be fine once the room stops spinning. But the station spins constantly to produce gravity. Wrong time to mention that. I want it on the record. I did not touch him. And I knew he could not be you because I had just said goodbye to you at the transport tube-- Oh, my head. Yo, he's awake. You, uh, better take a look. Good morning. This just gets better and better. Alternate realities. Of course, there'd be an alternate me. So who are you supposed to be? I'm you. Me. A different version of you. Or you're a different version of me or... It's a long story. How much time do you have? Go for it. Nope. Don't believe a word of it. But then I don't have to. She's here. -You briefed her? -A story, this complex. I longed her. Fair enough. Lyta, this man-- If it's even human. ...is either a madman, a spy, an assassin here to take my place, or he's telling the truth. Take a peek inside his head and tell me what's what and who's who. I'll try. Do you consent to the scan? Yes. This might feel a little funny. -Well? -He's telling the truth. He even met an alternate reality version of me. Apparently I died bravely. Okay, now, listen. -We need to-- -And there's something else. Something in his mind about a Shadow War. Yes. What's that? The Shadow War? You never... You never had the Shadow War? How long have you been in charge of B5? Coming up on two years now. Why? And nothing? What nothing? Interplanetary expeditions went to a world off the charts, woke up an entire civilization. IPX went out of business ten years ago. Then... Then they never went to Z'ha-- Z'ha... what? Boom. Z'ha'boom? You heard me. -What kind of name is that? -Not my department. And right now it's not important. If I jump one more time, it might be the last time for everyone. So what do we do? -Contact Zathras. -Who? Zathras. He works for the Great Machine on Epsilon 3. Look, whoever you are, if there was anybody named Zathras living on Epsilon 3 or a Great Machine, we'd know about it by now. Sheridan, go. Captain, we have a ship requesting permission to dock. It's... I know this is going to sound crazy, but it's from Epsilon 3. He said his name is Zathras. Works for the Great Machine. Ah. Yeah, no one listen to Sheridan. We'll meet him at Bay 9 in ten. Better make it five. Hurry! Not much time! Sheridan to Ivanova. Stop all incoming traffic. We've got a situation. Copy that. How... How did you follow me? Zathras did not follow. I am different Zathras. All Zathrii united. across time and space. We use quantum communications system. Keep in touch. Write on birthdays. In one reality, we are considered very handsome. The stars there are not very bright. Here. Here. Take stabilizer. Quickly! Press red button. It's not doing anything. You are final component. Quantum observer. Must sense your way back. Focus on what you were thinking when first shift happened. Stephen said the same thing. But I don't remember. Zathras thinks you do, and so does she. I was thinking about Delenn. I thought about you, and Mom. And how much I loved you, and this place, and it was like I could feel which way to go. I followed that feeling all the way home. I was thinking about how much I love my wife. How all I wanted was to hold her again. One more time. Not knowing where you were or where you were going on quantum scale made it impossible to find way home. You are so far off course that you cannot find your way back alone. But you are not alone. When she came to us, we told her great danger. But she insisted... So we made two. She has been chasing you across time and space ever since. Never giving up. Never surrendering. He said, "Love is the most powerful force in the universe." Love is all. Come home to me, John. I'm here, John. I'm here. I love you. I love you so much. I love you! And... I'm... coming... home. Let's go. Still the One. I should go. Ho. We need to talk. You should have seen it, Ambassador. The raw power of creation itself. Right there in front of us. For a minute, I thought we were done for. But then he said, "Love is the most powerful force in the universe," and the next thing you know, they're gone. He's not wrong. Love is a powerful thing. To follow him through time and space, putting her own life at risk. Sounds like someone I'd like to meet someday. Well, perhaps you shall. Only one thing puzzling me. He talked about this whole Shadow thing. Z'ha'boom. That mean anything to you? No, I'm sure it's nothing. Hmm. Maybe so. Captain Sheridan. How long until the bays are cleared for launch? -I have to get going. -Hey, so do I. And my reasons are twice as important as his. Repairs are almost finished. Any time now. Why are you always so hostile? I'm not hostile, just relentlessly self-aware. - Nine of clubs? - No. Queen of Diamonds? No. -Ace of-- -No. Perhaps you're not projecting hard enough. I am projecting at full P5! That's not the problem. The problem is, telepathy requires two minds. Sorry? Nothing. Nothing. Keep going. Ten of spades. Someone, please kill me. Ugh.
