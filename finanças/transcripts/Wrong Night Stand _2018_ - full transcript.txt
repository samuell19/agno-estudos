(Waves crashing) (birds cawing) (siren wailing) (footsteps approaching) (mischievous music) - [Man] What the fuck? (Groans) (door buzzes) (panting) (bell tolling) - I don't know, he just didn't hear me. I'll look, I-- Whoa. (Horn honks) Some guy just tried to hit me. Asshole. I can't go home empty-handed. Yeah, I don't know what I'm gonna get her. Yeah. Anyway, I'm just gonna go home, and you know, bust in there and have some galley. Aw, she's gonna love me. ♪ There's no better woman ♪ ♪ But I know what I'm feeling is true ♪ (laughs) ♪ I ain't got no worries ♪ - Oh, yeah. (Moaning) Who the fuck is this guy? Come here! Come here, you shit! (Grunting) - [Man] Fuck. (Tense music) (car engine starts) - Eddie, what's going on, mate? Time. - Does this look like we're slacking off to you? - No, mate. Just stirring ya, just stirring ya. - Hey, but anyway, man, you busy? - Always busy, mate. Always busy. You boys wanna jump in the ring? - [Eddie] Oh, yeah. Yeah, that'd be cool. - Cool, see you in a minute. - All right. So, when was this? - Couple of weeks ago. She said she wanted to take a break or some shit and then... Well, she'd been seeing him for about a month. - Out of the corner. Go, out of the corner. Good. Slip it off. Yep, good. Time, boys. Good stuff. Good job, have a rest. You fellas ready? (Uptempo electronic music playing) - You want my advice? Forget her, it's her loss. Move onto the next girl. - Straighter with that jab, Ed. Snappy with those punches. Don't get lazy. - Whoa. Stop trying to compete with them. You're never gonna be able to work 'em out. And stop dealing with girls like Stacy who like to fuck with your head. (Grunts) - Yeah, body shots there, good. Make him work, come on. Good. - [Ed] Just stop putting her on a fucking pedestal. - I don't need you to tell me what the fuck I did wrong. - Come on, Brett. The whole time you were with her, you never once thought about doing it with another girl? - [Trainer] Let's go, Ed. Back into it. - Okay, maybe a few times. So what? - Meaning, every once in a while the owner of the house wants their lawn mowed by someone else. - Time. (Grunts) Whoa, whoa, whoa, take it easy. Off, Brett. - I'm done. - [Trainer] What's wrong with him? - He's all right, man. I'll talk to him, thanks. (Uptempo electronic music playing) Look, Brett. I'm sorry for being so blunt before, man. I just know what you're going through right now, all right? Believe me, I know what you're going through. Look, why don't we go out tonight? Just have a couple of drinks, you know? See where the night takes us. - No, Ed. I'm not in the mood. - Come on, it'll be good for you just to get out and just let loose for a while. Stop thinking about things and stop thinking about her. Let's just have some fun. Remember those girls we picked up a couple of years ago at that club? - Yeah, I remember that. You had that girl that was kind of. - Hey. Shush. Look, I'll admit I was a bit off my game that night, okay? And she was a bit on the heavier side, but that's only because I knew... I knew you liked her friend better. And I'm willing to help you out again. - Just a few drinks, man. - That's what I'm talking about. - What bar are we going to? - Ladies and gentlemen, titty fans all around the world, rejoice. You're about to see an incredible act. Please, put your hands together and your legs apart for the amazing Ginger and Blonde. (Subdued jazz music) - Aw. Yeah. Yeah. Woo! - Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Ginger and Blonde! Yeah! Ginger and Blonde! So, stick around, folks. We're gonna be having more incredible entertainment coming your way and I may just have to call the boner police on your asses, oh boy, if you know what I mean. So, stick around, have a drink, enjoy each other's company, touch each other inappropriately, if you so desire. More beautiful ladies in just a few minutes. Okay. (Soft jazz music) - What are you looking at? - Nothing. - What do you mean nothing? You know what you were looking at. The point is, what are you gonna do about it? - Let me get a few drinks first. - What's wrong with going over right now? - Let me get a few drinks and I'll build up my nerve. - Build up your nerve? All you have to do is walk over and say hi. What's so hard about that? This is the reason why I brought you out tonight. - All right. One drink first. - Just go over and say hi now. Brett, she's gone. Go, go, go, yes. - [Brett] She's on her phone, man. - Well, get her off her phone. Jeez. What is so hard about coming from here and going there? Oh. Sorry. You all right? - Watch where you're going. - All right, settle down. I said I was sorry. (Uptempo music) - [Waitress] Shot. - So, how are things, Teddy? - I'm all right. It's home, it's good. - Why did you retire anyway? - I got bored with the old private dick stuff, you know? It's all tax evaders and disability pensioners on a fiddle now. No divorcees, no naughty little school girls run away from home. No juicy Lucys. Know what I mean? - Teddy, I want you to come back for a while. - Look, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll think about it. While I do, if the job involves these young girls, (laughs) I'm your man, mate. I'm your man. Christ, I haven't seen so much crumpet since I was a teenager. She's a bit of all right, isn't she? (Laughs) She one of your regulars? Does she (sucking and moaning)? - Teddy, she's exclusive. (Soft jazz music) - [MC] Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you've all had a drink and are well-lubricated. Get yourself ready for a fantastic second half. Let's give it up for the dancers, yeah. (Uptempo music) (soft orchestral music) - You all right? - Of course I'm all right. I'm still standing, aren't I? - All right, I was only asking. You ready to head off? - No, Ed. Let me finish my drink first. - Okay, how about we get you into a taxi? - How about we get you into a taxi? - Brett, you wanna tell me what the problem is? - You know what the fucking problem is, Ed. - No. No, I don't know what the fucking problem is. - This chauvinistic, arrogant, I don't give a shit persona. Think you're God's fucking gift to women. Think you know what to give 'em what they want. - Okay, look, I think you've had enough. - No, my drink. It's my fucking drink, Ed. I'll finish it. Oh. Let me tell you something. Least I'm... Least I'm being myself. I'm not pretending to be someone else. Think you're better than everyone else, huh? - No, look, you've had enough. That's it. - Fill me up. - Is he all right? - Yeah, he's fine. He's had enough. Come on, let's go, come on. - No, no, give me another whiskey. Give me a whiskey. - I think you should take him home. - Yeah, we're going. Come on, let's go. You've had enough, Brett, okay? Brett! - Do you have a boyfriend? I bet you cheat on him. I bet you're fucking-- - All right, that's it. Okay, all right, enough. Let's go. Move it. Come on, come on. - Fuck you, Ed. - Come on, come on. - Fuck you! (Siren wailing) - [Ed] Watch your head. Watch your head. - [Brett] Ed, Ed, you look easy. - 24 Albian Way Highgate. All right, buddy, sleep tight. - [Brett] Ed. Ed. Ed. I bet you're fucking every fucking-- - [Ed] Brett, Brett, that's enough. - [Brett] You know what the fucking problem is, Ed. - [Ed] No, I don't know what the fucking problem is. - [Brett] Pretending to be someone else. Chauvinistic, arrogant, I don't give a shit persona. (Engine clicking) - You again. (Dog barking) If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were stalking me. - Is she not going? - Yeah, she won't start. What are you doing? - Do you wanna pop the bonnet for me? Look, I'm trying to help, okay? But if my help's not needed, I'll go. (Latch thuds) (dogs barking) You were just planning on going home? - Yeah, something like that. You? - Well, I was out with a friend, but he had a little too much to drink, so I sent him home early. - Playing big brother, are we? - Yeah, something like that. Have you got a sharp knife or something I can cut something with? - Butter knife? - Yeah, that should do it. I'm Eddie, by the way. - Eve. - All right, give her a start. - Really? (Engine clicking) (dogs barking) - Well, you can't say I didn't try, huh? - Yeah. Can I have my butter knife? - Yeah. - Thanks. - Is there anyone you can call? (Dogs barking) - Nope. - [Man] Oi, shut the fuck up, will ya? Get inside. - Look, this is just a suggestion, but that's my house over there. You can come in, make a phone call there, if you like. It's up to you, but it's a Saturday night and either way you're gonna be stuck out here for a long time. - I'll be fine. I'll be fine. Thanks. - Okay. If you need me, I'll be over there. - Thanks. - [Man] Aw, fuck. My beer. (Tense music) Fuck it. Aw, check that out. Yeah, boy. Come on. Oi, you'd give that a stab, eh? (Knocking on door) - Hey, gorgeous. Wanna come party? (Soft piano music) (door opens) - All fixed. - Thought you were leaving without saying goodbye. - I was about to. Didn't want it to be awkward. Thought I left something behind. - Do you wanna meet for a drink tonight? - You have my number now. - Okay. (Subdued music) - You don't happen to have a girlfriend by any chance? - No, I don't have a girlfriend. Do you have a boyfriend? - No, I used to. Not anymore. (Tense music) (engine starts) (camera shutter clicking) (tense music) (people chattering) - How you going, man? - [Man] Are you fucking with me? - Come on, man. Don't start this. So, what'll you have me to do now, get back to work? - [Man] I don't know. I've been thinking about catching up on a bit of me past first. - What do you mean? - [Man] What the fuck do you think I mean? Do you still keeping an eye on where she is these days? - Sort of. I used to track her for a fair bit. She used to be easy to follow. I think I saw her at this club, actually. - Hey! - That fucking hurt, man. - Where is she? (Tense music) (moaning) - Oh, she's a bit of all right. That's Raj's bit of crumpet, isn't it? (Camera shutter clicks) Oh, Raj is gonna love this, isn't he? Not. (Cell phone chimes) (cell phone vibrating) Raj, you might have to find yourself another exclusive, eh, mate? Know what I mean? I just seen one of your favorites up an alley with some random geezer. He didn't look like a paying customer to me, mate. No. (Laughs) - [Raj] Find out where he lives. - No, I don't do that kind of stuff. I told you, I don't do it anymore. No, just don't put that one on me. - [Raj] Teddy. - (Sighs) All right, then. Yes, all right. Fuck. (Tense music) (cell phone vibrating) Oh, Raj. (Laughs) Yeah, guess what, mate? I'm looking at him. Yeah. (Laughs) (uptempo music) - Hey. Are you the owner? - No. Is there something I can help you with? - I wanna talk to the owner. - What's it about? - I wanna talk to him about one of his girls. - Sorry, Raj. There's a guy at the front, wants to talk to you about one of the girls. - Yeah, all right. Send him in. Yes, can I get you anything? - No, thanks. I'm fine. - So, I understand you are looking for an employee of mine. - Yeah, that's right. - And what's her name? - Eve Winters. - So, what exactly do you want to know? - What she does here. - Well, she works here as a regular glamour girl. The clients have a good time and the girls make them-- - What does that mean? - Exactly what it sounds like. - Have you slept with her? - That question is out of line. - Just answer the question. Just answer the fucking question! - Back off, asshole. (Tense music) - What the fuck is this? - I have a policy with my girls here. They don't see other men and they leave their personal life at home. I ask for loyalty to me and my clients. And Eve has certainly not been living up to her loyalty card. Mike. You seem like a good guy. And I can understand how you must be feeling. A younger man taking away your girl. You look like a man who could use some extra money. - What do you want me to do? - [Driver] Sure you wanna do this, man? (Engine starts) (microwave beeping) (knocking on door) (exciting music on TV) - [Ed] Now what did you forget? (Grunts) (Ed groaning) (punches thudding) (Ed grunting) - [Man] Loose the girl. (Air hissing) - Okay, that's all good. - So, am I okay to go? - I'll just go get your discharge papers for you to sign. - Thanks. - Oh, my god. Are you okay? - Ah! - Sorry. - I'm all right. I'm all right. - Sorry. - I'm all right. - What happened? - Just a couple of guys jumped me when I was going back inside the house. - [Eve] Did they take anything? - No. - Are you sure you're all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. Just a bit sore, that's all. I need to ask you something. - What? - Did I come in something here? I can come back. - No, no, it's okay. I've gotta go to work. I have an early shift at work anyway. I should probably go. - Brett. - Eve. What did you wanna ask me? - No, it's nothing. Just a big row, that's all. You go, I'll be fine. - Okay. I'll see you later? - Yeah, see you later. - It's nice to meet you. - What happened? (Tense music) (cell phone vibrating) (soft piano music) (uptempo electronic music) - Tell him to be here by 7:00 p.m. Hello, Eve. - Can I get you anything? - No, not at the moment. Although, I would like to see you after the shift. - Sure. ♪ Sittin' here thinkin' of you ♪ - Everything all right? - Yeah. - [Brett] You sure? You seem a bit distracted lately. - I'm fine. I just have a lot on my plate at the moment, that's all. - [Brett] Anyway. You wanna get a beer after we're done here? - No, not tonight. I'm busy. - You haven't called her, have you? - No, I haven't. I just wanna know what happened. - Come on, man. Open your eyes. Can't you see she's trouble? - Look, Brett, I appreciate your concern, but I know what I'm doing. - I don't think you do, Ed. - Well then, you tell me. You seem to have all the answers. - She's obviously got some bad history hanging around. It's gonna get you in trouble. Like you said with me and Stacy, move on. - She's different than Stacy, all right? She didn't cheat on me. - So, you're one who can give advice, but you can't take it, huh? - Yeah, that's right. I don't need your advice, so just stay out of it. - Fuck you, Ed. Oi, don't fucking walk away from me, huh? Did you ever think she was fucking other guys besides you? You ever think of that? - Why don't you shut your mouth before I do it for ya? - Look, I'm your fucking best friend, not some girl who sucked your dick for a couple nights and left ya out to dry. (Tense music) - That one is for last week's pay. And that one is for the next half hour. - Um... Look, I'm really sorry, but I'm not that kind of girl anymore. - You're a very special girl. Any man would be lucky to have you. - Thanks. - Well then, good luck with everything. (Birds chirping) (tense music) - Hey. (Water rushing) (cell phone whistles) (tense music) (people chattering) - Raj, that guy that come the other day? He wants to talk to ya. - [Raj] All right, send him in. - I'm just about to knock off. Can I get you anything else? - No, I'm fine. I'm talking with him. - Okay, I'll see you next week. - Okay, I'll see you next week. So, he got the message? - Yeah, he got the message. - Good. So, we're all done then. - No, not quite. I want the girl. - I don't see how that would be fair. - Take your fucking money. I want her address. - You know she quit today? Just walked out. Wanted to try something. Something new. He's here, you know? - [Man] Who? - Him, he's at the bar. Well, good luck with everything. - [MC] Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you've been having a great time. We are back with more amazing entertainment. You've seen the incredible Ginger and Blonde. Tee McGee is gonna be up in just a few minutes. I hope you're all ready for a fantastic evening! Yeah! (Tense music) I want everybody in the room to put their hands together and make 'em feel really welcome. Four birds who are gonna make you totally nuts. Give it up for Ginger and Blonde. - (Laughs) Sorry, champ. You all right? (Laughing) No, sorry, man. I'm barely keeping my head together tonight. You know what I mean? - It's all right, I'm fine. - Sure? - I'm sure, yes. - Beautiful. Name's Smithy. - Eddie. - Well, it's my mistake. Let me buy another drink. - No, no, look, I'm fine. - Eddie, buy me another drink. - [Ed] Get off, will ya? Get off. Now, get the fuck off me! - [Bouncer] Come on, mate. Time to leave. - [Man] Upstanding new friend there, mate. - Can I help you? - Okay, okay. Barman, can you get me two scotch and Coke's for my friend here? Good work. - Ginger and Blonde, ladies and gentlemen. Okay. - So, what brings you here tonight? - Nothing, just a night out. - Ah, I see that look in your eye. Waiting for somebody special. Who is she, huh? - I'm just meeting a friend. (Laughs) - All right. Cheers. Thanks, mate. All right. There you go, mate. Now that is how it's done, my friend. (Laughs) Nice to meet you, Ed. - Yeah, you too. - Take care. Stay safe. Look after yourself. (Upbeat music) (knocking on door) - Come in. - Hello, Raj. Now, what can I do for you tonight, eh? (Tense music) (retching) (uptempo music) - (laughing) Hey, you all right, mate? All right, let's get you out of here. Come on. Watch the steps. - Got any change tonight? Oi, what the fuck? Oi! (Tense music) (Ed grunts) - Let's fuck off, man. - Oi. - Look at this guy acting all tough and shit. - What are you gonna do about it, huh? (Gasping) (grunting) (coughing) (engine starts) (engine starts) (punches thudding) (ominous music) (laughs) (metal scraping) - Wake up, little bitch. It's time for some fun. (Laughs) Where should we start? Oh. Oh. I know. This won't hurt a bit. (Bones crack) (Ed yelling) Shut up. (Bones crack) (Ed yelling) Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up. Hurts, doesn't it? Somebody takes something that doesn't belong to them. (Laughing) - Hey, man. Stop it. Jesus Christ, he's had enough. (Ed yelling) - I said shut the fuck up. Get over here. - Just let him go. - [Man] Max. - Listen, I'm on your side, but it's all too much, man. Just let him go. Why do you always have to take everything so personal? - Because I do! - Look, so the guy's fucking your girl. Big deal, just get over it. - No! Now you listen to me. Let's go finish it. (Dramatic music) Get in the car! (Engine revs) Go get him! You're dead! Go, Max! Go and get him! Fucking get him! Go, go! Move, move! Get him! (Grunting) (train whistle blowing) - [Ed] Get off! - Get him, Max! Don't let him get away! Max! (Yelling) (train thuds) (train wheels clacking) (dial tone humming) (phone beeping) (phone ringing) - Come on, man. Pick up. - [Brett] Hello? - Yeah, Brett. It's me, man. Listen, I need you to come and get me right now, okay? - [Brett] It's four in the morning. What the fuck? - Look, man, I can't explain. I can't explain right now, all right? I'm just... I'm really in a lot of pain. I just need you to come get me right now, all right? - [Brett] Where are you? - Uh. I'm in a phone booth. I'm in a phone booth. It says Kluntoff Road outside. Do you know where that is? - [Brett] Yeah. Give me 10 minutes. - Uh, 10 minutes. Do you think you can get here a bit sooner, man? I'm just. - [Brett] Come on, Ed, I just woke up. - All right, yeah. All right, I guess. All right, I'll see you soon. Bye. (Tense music) - [Brett] What the fuck, Ed? What's going on? - [Ed] Just drive, drive. Drive, I'll explain later. (Engine starts) (engine racing) - [Man] We've got their descriptions down. Is there anything else you can tell us about this morning? - I can't. I don't know anything else. All I heard was this man's name, Hunt. You have enough information. Why can't you do anything about it? - It doesn't actually work that way. We actually need a lot more to work with. Can you remember anything else? Postal details, addresses, street numbers? - No, I can't tell you that. I wasn't in a position to remember street names, let alone know what post code I was in. - Ed, have you ever met any of these men before? - No. - What about affiliation through work? - What work? What are you trying to say? - Look, Ed. All we're trying to do-- - All it seems like you're trying to do is point the finger at me. - I would advise you to calm down. We are trying to help you and understand a few things. - Look, I've told you exactly what happened. Why is it so hard for you to understand? - Listen, try to see it from our point of view. You've only given us one thing to go on and that's a name. Whether that is his real name or not, doesn't really help us out much unless this man is on our records. And we've got a body not far from here lying on a railway track. - I didn't attack him, okay? I didn't even know the guy. - [Detective] And how do you think this looks when he tripped up and got hit by a train? - I didn't kill him, okay? He tried to kill me. I didn't even know the guy or any of them before last night. Whatever the hell happened these past few hours, I had no idea what the fuck was going on. - Well, what about this girl? - She's a girl I hooked up with about a week ago. I met her at the club. - Listen, we're gonna go and have a look for that body on the tracks, then we're gonna go through some of our paperwork and see if we can find anyone that matches the descriptions you've given us. In the meantime, I suggest you get over to the hospital and get checked out. Detective Chang's gonna go with you. Interview suspended, 5:32 a.m. (tense music) (sobbing) - I bet I know what you're thinking. You're thinking she was trouble. Well, you were right, man. She was trouble. I've had some trouble with girls in the past, but this one just takes it to a whole new level. And the worst part about it is, is that I actually fell for it. I'm sorry I hit you, man. I shouldn't have done that. - [Brett] It's okay, man. I shouldn't have said what I said. Do you wanna get an ice cream after this? - Yeah. Yeah, chocolate. - [Brett] Chocolate? - Yeah. - All right. - [Chang] Ready to go? - Yeah. (Knocking on door) - What happened between us? (Tense music) Did you just use me? No more lying. - I just wanted a hit. - Don't say that. Don't. - I used you. - Don't fucking say that! - Look, if any new information crops up, I'll let you know. - Thanks. - [Eve] Get off! (Door closes) (birds chirping) (knocking on door) - Eve. (Knocking on door) Eve. Come on. ("I'll Say She Does" by Al Jolson playing) Eve?

I just-- - Yeah, I know the feeling. - [Girl] Have a good day. - You, too. - [Girl] Bye. - See you around. (Laughing) - Hi, I'm Amy. I'm so sorry I'm late. I just... I caught the train, and then I missed my stop, and then there was a whole thing with the buses, but I'm here now and I just... I hope I don't look like too much of a mess, but, um... I saw the job online and I've had a bit of experience bartending, but I guess I was just a little confused as to what the job actually is. What do you want me to do? - Actually, it's quite simple. I'm sure you'll figure it out very soon. (Tense music) (soft piano music) (ominous piano music)
