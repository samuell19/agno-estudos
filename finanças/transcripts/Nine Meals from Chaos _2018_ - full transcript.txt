There's no future for mankind. Scientists, philosophers, writers... all seem to agree. Humans, simply put, are wired up wrong. They destroy more easily than they build. They harbor a need to kill. They are parasites on the land they occupy. They are that child who spends an afternoon on the beach building a beautiful sandcastle... then gleefully destroying it in a few seconds... and feeling prouder of the latter achievement. Thousands of years of history have proved this simple truth. -- Subs OCR'ed+transcribed, corrected and resynced by darthfrede -- Those who think humans have progressed to anything higher than a dangerous and selfish animal... they either don't know history... or are fooled by the thin veneer of civility they display in times of peace. Not many survived. Either through the direct impact of the cataclysm, fleeing to find death elsewhere, or by the rampant diseases that easily spread over the next ten years. That is how fragile a society almost exclusively structured around machines is. It took just ten years to reach this point. Ten short years to lose all social, legal and agricultural structures. Ten years for them to consume every living animal available... and revert back one thousand years. There was no critical mass of people anymore to generate new structures or rule the chaos. All forms of organized plantation turned into overgrown weeds. Cannibalism has been justified as a necessity. From this, an uncountable number of children became orphaned. Stop! These groups of parentless children are forced to a nomadic lifestyle... for their own safety. Wandering aimlessly in groups, they seek only sustenance, but also shelter... and those who attempt to survive off of them. Having been the recipient in the last generation of a cotton wool treatment of excessive chemical medication, they have lost the kind of natural protection from diseases that animals naturally have. They die of the slightest infection. What's your name? Tisha. The children left their towns and cities that became useless and uninhabitable. Only the countryside would offer them any possibility at all of survival... and protection. One could say these children were "hunter-gatherers"... without the necessary experience the ancient generations had. The insensitivity of taste had already kicked in... and any source of protein was gladly consumed without complaint. Besides, it did their bodies better good than their own parents' hormoned, fatted nutrition... that often caused their deaths from excess. He fell in one of those traps. We only light fires at night. Otherwise, they'll see the smoke. Look, guys! Gimme! Gimme! They're rats. Parasites. Where did mum go again? I don't know. The first twelve years of humans are ones of play... play being the very essence of them. No amount of formal schooling can take that simple instinct away from young humans. It is inspiring, even emotional, to see how, even in the worst circumstances, their ability at play. Playing like nothing else existed. Lolo... Lolo. Where did you find the carrots? No. Where did you find the carrots? No. Where? Every method was used to catch these children... who were, conveniently for those who preyed on them, relegated to the level of parasites. This is a term that historically has been repeatedly used by humans to justify their cruelties towards others. Shall we go now? Let's wait. Yet, direct conflict with these so-called "parasites" was deemed too dangerous... both for their ability to outnumber their predators... and their extreme viciousness. Go get the body. Where? Go and get it! Moralless, hungry children in numbers under threat are without doubt the most vicious and agile kind among our species. Go play somewhere else. Go! And your friends? They left. Where? I don't want to go on. I want to stay here with you lot. Why? He was my brother. Eiher we die... or you die. Us, then. Do whatever you want. Lolo! Lalu! Lolo! Grab it! Help me! Parasites! Help! Lolo! Grab it! What are you doing? Lolo. We shouldn't have gone. I didn't want to. But we had to save Lolo. Save him? You're the coward who let go of the rope! Me? A coward? Guys, fighting's stupid. Everything will be fine once we reach Epecu. And how do you know that? I came from there. All we have to do is follow the train tracks. Sure. Whatever you say. They don't even know what it is. They wouldn't even care anyhow. Nomadic humans always look for a promised land of some kind. These children are no different. Inbuilt human hope and optimism for a better life ahead counts for much of the reason they accept the suffering of life. These children's promised land was a place said to have been spared the disaster... or at least mostly rebuilt... where the need to hunt them was no longer necessary, and where new organized life was starting again. Guys! Hello. What's wrong with him? He doesn't speak. He bit me. Guys, he's following us. What's your name? He bit me. And now he's crying. It's because he can't speak... and he has no parents. Come on. He can't say anything. As the only possible guide through barren lands and empty towns... they would follow the remaining train tracks that would necessarily bring them to where larger groups of humans lived... and possible sustenance. When these tracks disappeared under water, were burned or ripped out... they would simply guess their path. The wearing of clothes in humans had in fact little to do with shame of nakedness... which humans don't naturally have... but rather practicality and comfort. Vanity sometimes has a part in it. But with none to speak of, these children would wear what was left in abandoned houses... for comfort's sake. Chacha, your face! You too! Look! Look! Look! We had forgotten what play was. We locked our children in walls and cities, we replaced their freedom by thrusting addictive machines in their hands every Christmas... which shut them up and terminated their social abilities. War and the ravages of it is not all horror... but a healthy resetting of human values. I need water. I'm going to die. Lolo, he once saw a bird... and he really liked it. Guys, we can't keep stopping like this. We need to get to Epecu. How far is it from here? I don't know. It took me a few days to get here. There is no Epecu. Tata, what are you doing on my head? I think it's a rat. He bit me. I don't like it when animals die. They did nothing wrong. Many animals died then. More than twenty-five. Even more, maybe. Look at the colors. Look. For sure, they talk of Epecu. Where? That's about Epecu. No. Why were you under the train tracks? Did you have a dad? A mum? What happened to her? Men. What happened? First there was one, then others came... and mummy was screaming harder every time. And? Where is she now? One of them cut her open here. She died. I'm gonna cut them. What? Here. Who? All men. We go? There are people there for sure. I can't keep it up. NATIONAL MINISTRY OF EDUCATION Wait here, I'll go. Come on! There's no one! Where would the owners be? Dead, for sure. Guys, there's nothing here. Nothing! Guys! See what I found! What? - And this? - It's for drinking. - "Cobos." - How do you know that? Don't know. I guessed. With a stick. With anything. Look. - Come on, open it. - I can't. It's shut tight. What if we hit it with a stone? Got an idea. Mummy... Relax. I won't harm you. I'm a mother. Look, these are my children. We went looking for food... and my youngest one died. We buried him. Stay, please! I was a teacher in this school. They all died... but I stayed here. Now, there's no one left... but perhaps... we could start a new school. Oh, how lovely that would be. Would you like that? Those colored sticks that light up... I kept them... for when my students came back. They're lovely, aren't they? You like them? Now I have none left. My children are also unwell. But this boy is sick as well. What happened to him? I can help you. I can cure you. Come with me. I'll put some cream on this and tomorrow you'll be better. Leave him, I'll take care of him. Come along. Now you can sleep easy. I'll take care of him. You, go to sleep. You feel pain? I know it hurts you. I feel your suffering. I will help you. And you will help my children. Easy now. Sleep. You'll feel better after. # Sleep tight... Sleep tight... # # Sleep tight, my little child. # - # Sleep tight, my little boy. # - # Sleep tight, with God. # # He will take you in his arms. # # Sleep tight... Sleep tight... # # Sleep tight... Sleep... # # Sleep tight, my... # He's dead. Children. Children, wake up. Come on, children. I have some very bad news. Your little friend... died. He's with the angels now. I did all I could... but he passed away. I'm so sorry. Children? Children! Children, don't go! Children! Children! Don't leave! At least stay for dinner. Children! And the new school? I'm a good mother. I did it for him... and... for my children. He's better now. He's with... He's with... with Jesus... with Mary... who was also a mother. And... he must be with... Mateo... who couldn't write well. I helped him a lot. How I loved my students. Anyone would have done the same. I did a kind deed. I'm a good mother. Let there be no mistake... None of our human morals survive extreme hunger. None. We were there. But now he's dead, and no one thinks of him. How was it in Epecu when you were there? I had my parents there. It's very nice there. There are swimming pools with games. And people don't hit or kill children. When I get there, I'll... I'll cry... because I'll have a family. It's only two or three days before we get there. And where will we get food from? We can't manage three more days. There isn't even any water around here. I'm so hungry. Besides seeking food, the second-highest priority among them became the reproduction of the declining species... from the very moment nature dictates it to be possible... and long gone was the ideal about young adults not being ready to procreate. A child is no longer one when it can conceive their own children. Nature dictates this... and everything returns to nature. Any and all of these moral battles that attempt to distance ourselves from our elemental instincts... are bound to fail. Guys, Tati has gone. What do you mean she's gone? I don't know. She left with the baby. The father needs to go get her. We can't just leave her. How will she survive? If she wanted to go... Are you going to leave like Tati and the baby? No, I'm staying. Promise? What now? Where do we go? We go straight. But there are no more tracks. Only mountains ahead. We cross them. It's salty. I can't go on. I need water. Is there much left? We can't go on. You're leading us nowhere. Guys, I think there's a beehive there. We need to go on. What's happening? What happened? A snake... There? No big deal, it was only a small one. Among thousands of orphaned children scattered everywhere... are some who simply had not had enough contact with their parents to develop communicative skills. These are more likely to survive than those who had been handfed. Are you hot? I'll get you some water soon. Tata! Tata! Tata! What're you doing? Let it go! Let it go! You're hurting it! I'm leaving! Guys, look. They're probably going to Epecu. They're going to Epecu? Yes. Okay, we'll follow them. But only at night. In times of genuine famine, it was the good people who died first. Those who refused to steal, to sell their bodies or eat their own species disappeared first. Those who refused to kill would be killed first. It's no surprise humans ended up like this. Have you seen Juan? Who? Juan... I'm searching for Juan. Did he pass by here? What are you talking about? He's my brother. Everyone knows him. Should we kill him? Do we kill him? How'd we cook it? Just as he is. He's just hungry. Juan... Do we cut him or not? He stinks. I have a carrot. It was for Tata. Guys, he died. Are we gonna cut him? We don't do that. They do it to us! I'm so hungry. I'm gonna cut him. He stinks of shit! Since seeing them in their natural state, I can do nothing else but laugh at the ideals we held on childhood innocence. Better every time. In times of peace and boredom, we dressed them in cotton white, gurgle at them, slap them for any natural deviancy... and gaze teary-eyed at our own ideal of innocence. I'm sick of this! That's right! How much longer is this damned trek? How much longer of this? How much left? I can't go on anymore. I'm starving and I'm thirsty! This is a waste of time! We need to keep going. I can't keep it up for any longer! I can't go on! I can't go on! Who's coming with me? If you want to break up, fine, but I know where I'm going. Look, guys! Footprints! The train tracks! There, below! They're going to Epecu. You see, I was right! Are you okay? Yeah. Don't worry. What does it say there? We're here, let's go! This is Epecu? Surrounded by such powerful technology, humans forgot that the moment the grid disappeared... so did their lives as they knew it. We are not who we say or think we are. We are just one rampant disease away from going back to living like animals. We walked all this way for this? It's worse than where we came from. Where's Sama? She tricked us. She just gave us up, and left! What's left for me? What's left for me? All this just for this? There's nothing else? It's just the law of the strongest over the weakest? It's only that? What's left for me? I killed my brother... and I let Chacha die. Is that all I have left? Nothing else? Before, it was all good. I had my mum and dad. I was used to them going away... and them hiding me in the basement. It was all dark. No sounds. And I waited. But this time they never came back. After two days, there was no food left. I was scared. Then, the rats came. I couldn't see them... but they were there. Because the next day... they ate part of my finger. Men came... and they got in... and I didn't move... and they left... I got out... and saw the group. At night... I can't shut my eyes. Because I'm scared. Scared of the dreams. They're so dark... and I'm alone. I'm still... in the basement... and I never got out. Blood! I'm hurt! Guys, come on! Come! I'm sick of this... I'm tired of it... I'm going somewhere else. If you want to come with me... Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, shit... They're attacking them! From every side! Move! I knew they would come here. Thanks for bringing them. What do we do with this one? Save him for reproduction. I knew humans were animals... but not at this organized level. History repeats itself. We are bound to this. We judge these survivors on our own recent values... but these are no reference point at all. Blinded by fake progress... our own true nature had become alien to us. We chose, at our peril, to ignore history... and think that our human instincts and genes progressed at the same rate as technology... but we really are only animals... nine meals away... from chaos. And a very powerful film, indeed. Congratulations. You infiltrated a very difficult country at a very difficult time... with risks at every turn. Tell me, did you ever fear for your own life? I admit, I did. What you cannot see from the film were the diseases these children had. Their diseases were the most worrying part of the job, as they were often contagious and dangerous. A question I had... That very striking girl... who disappeared at the end of the documentary... Tell me, was she part of the production in any way? No comment. What do you think the future of these children is? And where are they now? I don't see much future for them. They are, like... lost souls. I know that, sadly, more than half of them died. But I plan to go back in a year or two... and film a second episode. Something like... "Nine Meals: The Return"? Yes, something like that. Or... "Where Are They Now?" Well, we'll look forward to this. And congratulations on your prize. Tell me, what do you think you'll be using the prize money for? Well, after twenty years of such difficult infiltration, I plan to retire. Me and my wife... She is expecting any day now. We have decided to buy a new cottage on the lakefront... and rest for a few years. Well, you deserve it... for that very important and hard work. And we thank you very much for helping those poor lost souls... in that desperate, desperate situation they're in. So, we wish you all the very best, and welcome anytime, and congratulations again. Thank you. It's been so long since he left. But he'll come back. He has to come back. I'm staying here until he comes back.
