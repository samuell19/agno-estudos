And l could tell that he didn 't want to see me. L was devastated . And l just walked in the snow for hours. The Coast Guard found out l was under age and discharged me. And then when they discharged me, l went back down to Los Angeles. L worked as a delivery man. L worked wrapping presents at Brothers in Hollywood . L worked at the Orange Julius stand on Hollywood Boulevard . L did an awful lot of jobs. My brother was the one who introduced me to horses. L wanted to do whatever my brother did . And then my brother went on , of course, to other things, but l stayed with the horses. L loved being around the horses when they were in their stalls. L loved the smell of them . L loved working around them . L loved riding . And l got a job mucking out and being at the barn. When the horse came into my life, they totally consumed my life. One weekend at the barn , Dick Clayton came out, who was an actor at the time, with an actress by the name of Ann Blyth . And they were doing a photo layout for one of the movie magazines. Well , l was fascinated , so l just stood there and watched . And then Ann left, and l got to talking to Dick afterwards, and we became friendly. Dick never came on to me like a lot of people did . L never felt a hidden agenda from Dick Clayton because l just felt so comfortable with him . L never had a man in my life like that. And he was the one who first planted the seed for me-- how would you feel about being an actor? And l thought, oh, wow, that'd be terrific. L did start thinking about it. But l didn 't know what to do, where to begin, how to get started in the business. Henry wilson was an agent for a lot of young actors. Henry had a stable of stars-- Guy Madison, Rory Calhoun, Rock H udson . Henry wilson was a big-deal agent. And it seemed like every actor he touched became a big star. And he had a certain style of client, and he was the one who would take the pretty boys and make stars out of them . Dick Clayton said l want you to me Henry wilson . You know, he doesn 't have the most sterling reputation . And l went there and met him . You know, he was giving you the look and the stare and all that. L ' m not an idiot. L could see what was going on there. Oh , yeah , Henry would put the make on me every now and then. Occasionally his knee would push against your knee or something like that. Well , l just wasn 't interested. L mean , Henry was an amusing , fun person to go out with once in a while, but that was it. Henry was certainly not my type. We were sitting in his office, and he said the name's gotta go. So he said we've got to tab you something . So that's how Tab came about. And l showed horses-- hunters and jumpers. And Henry said , that's it-- Tab H unter. That' s a good name. L can just see my new name, Tab Hunter, on the marquee. L remember having a few drinks, and l was feeling no pain. L said , l ' m going to be a movie star. (LAuGH l NG) Art Gelein became Tab H unter. The new name was hard for me to get used to though. And then Henry said , well , once you see it on " pay to the order of, " it won 't be so bad . He was a man who was eager, excited , and enthusiastic, and wanted it. Boy, it sure did come fast. ANNOuNCER: A lush , topical paradise beyond your wildest most romantic dreams. The first interview l had was for " lsland of the Desire. " so they sent me to meet the director. He looked up and said , that's the boy l want. And he asked me to take off my shirt. L was really embarrassed . L then did a screen test with Linda Darnell . She was a very big name. Oh , l was a nervous wreck doing a screen test. She said , don 't worry. L ' m good luck for newcomers. And they said , now you take her in your arms and you kiss her. L took her in my arms and l kissed her. (LAuGH l NG) l kissed her. She looked at me. And they said , cut, and she pinched me, and she said , that was nice. (LAuGH l NG) Audience response was phenomenal . Critics, ha, they hated . You ' re out of your mind! Darn right. This blasted island 's got me loco. L got roasted. Hello, Hawaii . Hello, America. Hello, England . Hello, anybody! He doesn 't demonstrate any shred of acting ability in that film . L was born too late, and l 've got a lot to learn . My mother and l did go to a screening of it. The lights came up. My mother said , you were lousy. L was so bad in the movie that l couldn 't get arrested . It was a long spell between " lsland of Desire" and my next job. The only parts l could get were grade-z movies. L nterpreting hieroglyphics was part of my archaeological studies. L felt that l was a B actor trapped in that genre of film , and there was no way out. Hello, Pop! TAB H uNTER: Acting was something that Dick Clayton was always on my case about. This isn 't something that just happens. You 've got to work. There's so much to learn and so much to tap inside of myself. And l wanted to go on to the next step. And he arranged for me to do " Our Town . " lt was important for me to do it because it was great material and a chance to grow. Marilyn Erskine, a Broadway actress, who was very good , did not want to do " Our Town " with me. George was a marvelous part for a young actor. But Tab Hunter playing George? Well , l didn 't see that. And so l was a little bit concerned because that' s such an important part of the play. We did a read through. And after we finished the reading she agreed to do it with me. She said , OK, young man , we've got a lot of work ahead of us. Let's get to it. Well , l wanted him to be comfortable within himself that he can do this. Tad had that desire to really be good . L saw an actor who grew and grew, getting better and better and better. TAB H uNTER: The only thing l really could rely on were my instincts and my feelings. And they won 't lead you too far astray. And Tab was just fabulous. He was George. The play was extremely well received , got good notices-- the first good notices l ever received in my life. From that, it sort of whet the appetite. L came away from that experience realizing that l wanted to be an actor. The studios ran Hollywood . Hollywood was MGM , Paramount, 20th Century Fox, warner Brothers. It was just a society in unto itself, warner Brothers. It was the best studio, so we were very proud . But you did not cross to cross Jack warner. Colonel warner-- Colonel Jack warner, ladies and gentlemen . You know, warner was quite a character. He really was. He looked like Lucifer with a little mustache of his. Ha, you son-of-a-bitch . (LAuGH l NG) when you had a guy like Jack warner on your side, you had the whole warner Brothers operation on your side. You were in business. The studio contract was really good because of the security of it. At warner Brothers, they had acting classes, singing, dancing. And l said , Henry, l really need to go to work. And Henry sent out wired to different producers saying Tab H unter' s available. And he arranged for me to meet , casting director of warner Brothers. And l got a call from the studio. They took out an option that they might put me under contract. And your first picture will be with John wayne in and Lana Turner in "The sea Chase! " , more coffee. Yes, sir. All l had to say in the film was, yes, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you. Everybody, sir. "The sea Change" was an all right film , but l had nothing to do in it. L was very disappointed . Jack warner was looking at rushes of the film , and a director by the name of william wellman , "wild Bill " wellman , happened to see a couple of my scenes and said , l want that kid for my next picture. And the next picture was "Track of the Cat" with Robert Mitchum . The place is just crawling with dreams. Do you have any, kid? L go along Mitch very well. He had great sense of humor and was full of hell . L really like him a lot. Well , the first big film l did at warner Brothers was a film called " Battle Cry. " " Battle Cry" was the biggest picture warner's had that year. They tested me nine times for the role of Danny Forrester. Sorry, l-- l felt kind of itchy. L wasn 't the only one who tested for that role. Kiss me. Can 't hear. Warner' s tested J immy Dean and Paul Newman for the role. They still couldn 't make up their mind . So they said, well , we' ll give this kid one more test. The morning l left to go to the test my mother stopped me at the door, and she said , think positive. See yourself in this role. And she said , if it's meant to be, it will be. L thought l was so bad in that test l went home and was ready to kill myself. And that was the test that got me the role. Give me a cheeseburger and a cup of coffee. And , uh , how about a piece that apple pie too. L just liked the role. It reminded me of my brother. He was a very straightforward, decent human being . Any guy in the world would be lucky to have you for a wife. The film was very successful . It was a major hit for warner Brothers. ANNOuNCER: " Battle Cry, " the warner Brothers story of the Marines, having its world premier. L started getting so much recognition for doing it that l was offered the seven-year contract with warner Brothers. L thought, whoa. Tab H unter! And when that came on , it was like you struck a match, and off it went. ANNOuNCER: Hollywood pays tribute to bright, new stars of tomorrow. Awards go to blue-eyed and blond Tab H unter. They translated everything into box office receipts. Jack warner saw box-office gold in Tab. Once l was under contract to them , all this publicity came out on me, and the publicity exceeded the product. ANNOuNCER: Actor Tab H unter signs autographs in the time-honored way. They were selling the All-American boy. Take him home to mother. It was a nice wholesome image. How do you feel about dancing tonight? Are you ready? A little awkward , but l guess l ' m ready. He was everywhere. We were being bombarded with Tab' s presence. And l was delighted because he was so exciting to be watching . ANNOuNCER: America's favorite sweethearts, Tab H unter and Natalie wood . Natalie wood was the sweetest little thing that ever came down the road . L loved her. She was like my kid sister. You really got it made, haven 't you? TAB H uNTER: she had been a very successful in " Rebel without a Cause" with Jimmy Dean , and l had been successful in " Battle Cry. " warner Brothers put us together. They wanted to make us into the new " dream team . " we went along with it, of course. ANNOuNCER: Tab H unter, Natalie wood . And they had a great time together. She adored him . L never met a gal with such spunk. ROBERT wAGN ER: He was on fire, and she was on fire. They traveled a lot together. They went on tours together. TAB H uNTER: Oh , my gosh , there were thousands and thousands of kids. He looked like he loved being a movie star, and he was a good one. ANNOuNCER: warner Brothers stars Natalie wood and tab H unter plant a Christmas parade for the annual Toys for Tots campaign . But l knew Tab first from his music. TAB H uNTER: The recording career came about when Randy wood of Dot Records said , how would you like to record? L said , l ' d love it. Randy had me come over there. L cut the record . Randy yelled out, that' s it. It's gonna be a hit. (sl NGl NG) --for every boy and girl there's just one love in this whole world , and l-hi kno-ho l -hi-l found mine. It became the number one song in the nation . (sl NG l NG) Young love. Young love. First love. First love. When "Young Love" hit number one on the pop charts, it knocked Elvis out of number one and stays for a month and a half at the top of the national charts. Jack warner blew his stack. He said , we own you for everything . He had totally prohibited me from recording for Dot any longer. And l said , but Mr. warner, you don 't have a recording company. And he said , well , we do now. And , they started warner Brothers Records for me. [MuslC- TAB H uNTER, " Nl N ETY N l N E wAYs"] Tab had a real genuine reporting career. He was not a one-hit wonder. He released dozens of singles and albums. It was phenomenal , and it was noticed by everyone. (sl NG l NG) what a wonderful wedding there will be. What wonderful day for you and me. He came along at a very brilliant time. It was the beginning of the teenage revolution in America. He had a million and one crushes from the largest group of teenagers that has ever lived in the united states, the baby boomers. They were the ones who would make a career overnight, and they certainly did with mine. L can 't help it. L 've got a very bad case of Tab H unter-itis. L know just how you feel. L had Tab' s pictures on my wall . We all did . My wall was covered with pictures of Tab H unter. Young girls just were crazy about him . The minute they took a look he became their guy, and he was marketed to those people. It was the movie magazines that really made him a huge star, more than the films that he was making . TAB HuNTER: The kids kept demanding all of it, so l would get things like "Tab H unter Buys a Hat, " "Tab Hunter Drives a Car, " "Tab H unter Cleans a window, " "Tab H unter Goes to the Beach-- " wee! (LAuGH l NG) One of the magazines had a contest, and l won a date in Hollywood with Tab H unter in 1 958. Was l nervous? L could hardly breathe. When l first saw Tab H unter, l was very intimidated . And he smiled , and that smile was just truly magical . Tab H unter was the heartthrob that l had seen in the movie magazines. And we had dinner and dancing . L could not believe, Jo-Ann, here you are dancing with Tab H unter. My date was over, and he gave me a kiss. L felt like Cinderella, and l had a kiss from my Prince Charming. It was a dream-come-true. L n the 1 950s love and marriage was the ideal theme. It's not always very real . The studios had a system . And they always wanted their starlets to go out on a date with a beautiful , handsome boy. And the one they chose was Tab H unter. He was a guy that all the girls wanted to go out with . Of course l wanted to meet Tab H unter because he was the big young male star at warner Brothers, and l was the big female star at Colum bia Pictures. And so we had to date. He was a gentleman . He always came around and opened the doors. He picked up checks. And my parents liked him . It was fun . We did all sorts of things. We did all the things that normal people do on dates. But we had a third person who was a photographer with us. He was the kind of boy every mother would want to have married into her family. He had an honesty. He had a sim plicity. He a certain strength of character. He would not let anybody down . We got along great because he was always fun and sweet. And he wasn 't after me, so he wasn 't on the make. And women like that. L really was a very naive, young , innocent girl, and l would never think that the most handsome boy would be gay. TAB H uNTER: l would never discuss my private life with anyone. L was able to get close to them , but l never really went that deep in the relationship. L had the ability to live behind this wall . And you only allow people to break the barrier if you feel you can confide in them and you want to have that friendship. L NTERvl EwER: what was your first relationship with another guy? Pfoof. (LAuGH l NG) The first relationship l had was when l was ice skating with a fellow skater. L NTERvl EwER: Can you tell me about that? What do you want to know? (LAuGH l NG) l always loved figure skating . L competed in the regionals, and l went to the nationals. L enjoyed just being on the ice. He was a very good skater and a very strong competitor as well . A lot of his friends were ice skaters-- champion ice skaters with the lce Capades. Mouseketeers, meet Ronnie Robertson. H i , Ronnie! H i , Mouseketeers. H i , Bob. Ronnie Roberson was known as a great technician. H is skating was different than anybody else' s skating . And he could spin faster than anybody in the world. Nobody ever spun that well . He was a major talent. We had an attraction for one another. And l drove him home one evening after a skiing session . Next thing , we were in a relationship. L ' m sure there was talk about Ronnie and myself in the skating world , particularly if you 've got a talent and people are jealous of it. There were times when l was certainly stressed hearing things that had been said . But you learn when you ' re in the public eye to compartmentalize. A big issue as that Tab was around . And the political game at that time is you don 't do that. There was one skater that didn 't like the fact that Ronnie and l were friends and took a skate blade to my new car and just went right down the side, (sCRATCH l NG sOuN D) to the paint. Tab came to the championships with Ronnie Roberson . Ronnie was told that he would not win the championships unless Tab would not come along. And Ronnie said , it didn 't matter. He wanted him there. And Ronnie skated-- oh, magnificent performance. The fact that l was there with Ronnie might have hurt his ability to win , and he should have won . My mother never really approved of the Hollywood stuff. Being private was very im portant to her. She only visited me on a set twice in all of the years l was in the business. She did one interview for a magazine, but it was like pulling teeth to get her to do that. People would say, oh, Mrs. Gelien , aren 't you excited about Tab? And my mother would say, yes, it' s nice, but walter's the intelligent one. My mother was always a very intense woman. She had a lot of pressure in her life. She was very high strung . While l was doing " Battle Cry" l was in touch with my mother a lot. And l noticed a change in her behavior. She would fly off the handle rather quickly. She was ranting on behind a closed door in the bathroom in German . And she ran out into the street and collapsed in my arms. It just got more out of control and more out of control . My mother totally lost it, and l had to commit my mother to a mental institution. And it was very difficult to do. And on the way there l said , Mom , please try to understand what l ' m saying. L really feel bad about this. And she said , l know. L know. L had to comm it my mother. L mean , there was nothing else that l could think should be done. She had to have 37 electroshock treatments. L went down there to see her, of course. L remember walking in , and she was lying in bed , and they shaved her head where she had all the treatments. And as l walked in she said , why did you do this to me? She was very fragile when l went to see her, but she was better. When l saw my mother, as helpless as she was, l swore that she would never have to work another day in her life. Hello, l ' m Tab H unter. Did you know that mental illness claims more victims than any other disease? That' s right. One American in every 1 0 is suffering from some disabling mental or emotional disorder. L n the 1 950s being gay was absolutely not acceptable. It was against the law. It was considered a mental disease. There were very devastating consequences. You couldn 't have a life being gay back in the '50s Tab would be foolish not to hide, or he would not have a career. What do you think of your dinner date here, Tab? She' s very lovely, l must say. ANNOuNCER: lsn 't she? Oh . The public saw me as one person, and l was another. L didn 't feel good about myself. Hollywood 's most eligible bachelor, Mr. Tab Hunter! TAB H uNTER: l never felt that l deserve a lot of that stuff that was happening. You were rewarded for pretending that you were someone you ' re not. Henry wilson was a good agent, but people outgrow one another. Then Dick Clayton became an agent. L signed with him immediately because l could trust him , and he was family. L told Henry l was leaving him . He was furious. Henry was very, very upset. L n fact, because of that, l ' m sure it's why he turned over that story to " Confidential " magazine on me. L n the 1 950s the magazine that you had to be most concerned about was "Confidential . " Oh , " Confidential " was the talk of Hollywood because everyone was afraid that if there was a skeleton in the closet, it would be released . God knows l love you. But l won 't let Ned nor Kay or anyone else run our lives, Cary. " Confidential " magazine, they had some information on Rock that was very damaging to his career. And they were going to print it. Rock H udson was the biggest star that Henry wilson ever had . He built Rock, and that was his meal ticket. He was gonna protect that. To save Rock, Henry gave " Confidential " the story about me when l ' d been arrested when l was just starting out in the business. L nside the magazine the article read , "Tab H unter caught at a limp-wristed pajama party. " l would say l was thrown under the bus. When the magazine came out, l was sure that my career was over. L took Natalie to the Academy Awards. That was about the time-- a little after the "Confidential " had come out. The press of the world was there photographing us. And one guy yelled out, smile pretty this way, Tab. This is for the next issue of " Confidential " magazine. Jack warner, god bless him , he turned me right back to the cameras and said , just remember this. Today's headlines, tomorrow' s toilet paper. Everybody was nervous. But in those days they could cover those things up. So if you are a money maker for a studio, they are going to protect that image like there is no tomorrow. The press knew just about everything, and they kept it to themselves when it was to their advantage and to the advantage of the studios. It was a gentleman ' s agreement-- just keep it out of the press and don 't make waves. Jack warner and l never discussed my sexuality whatsoever. L was making a lot of money for them . As long as l didn 't destroy this image that they were creating, that was important to them . They created this persona. That was your job to be that persona. You played the game, so to speak, if that's what they want. L did sign a contract, and l was willing to do whatever they wanted me to do to fulfill that contract. Don 't you ever think about marriage? All the time, Ernie. That' s what keeps me single. L thought of marriage a num ber of times because it's expected of you . When l did the film " Lafayette Escadrille, " that's when l first met Etchika Choureau . She stopped me dead in my tracks. She was gorgeous. And we hit it off immediately. She didn 't speak a word of English. My French was just awful . L can 't remem ber what we talked about because he did not speak one word of French and l only spoke three words of English . L don 't know how we communicated . . . undoubtedly with our eyes. But in any case, we got on like a house on fire. And he was irresistible. L usually can think of a lot of things to say. Suddenly l can 't say anything. We had wonderful times together, and l was drawn closer and closer to her. Yes, l had heard that Tab was homosexual . L think it was a soul-searching period of time about his sexuality. It must have been very painful for him . You know, actors often . . .always. . . have two faces. L did feel discomfort, and l did feel a little bit of guilt also. But l did seriously think of marrying Etchika. L was flattered to have been chosen , of course. If l was to marry Tab, it would have been for love. L would inevitably have never accepted to share him with someone else. And l certainly would not have married him to protect him and hide his homosexuality. L think Tab was too good of a man . He would have never accepted such a thing. It would have been a lovely story if it could have been rewritten . She went back to Paris. L just couldn 't commit to her. It wouldn 't have been right to be with Etchika. L felt that if you were with a man, you were sinning . And if you were with a woman , you 'd be lying . Tony and l met at the pool of the Chateau Marmont. He was in California doing " Friendly Persuasion. " l don 't want to die. L don 't know if l could kill anyone if l tried . He was a good actor. ANNOuNCER: what is there about Tony Perkins that made the young people of America acclaim him as their star of the future? L 'd been in the business longer, but l respected the fact that he' d done Broadway plays. L thought he was very intelligent, and he was just fun to be with. We just kind of hit it off. [MuslC- ANTHONY PERKl Ns, " MOON LIGHT swl M "] And l went up to his room with him . That' s when Tony and l got together for the first time. And that's when we started seeing each other. When l first saw Tab and Tony l knew that they were more than friends. It was pretty obvious. L had a wonderful relationship with him . L did trust him . L was comfortable with him . Tony and Tab were totally different. Tony was East Coast. Tab was west Coast. Tab was very macho. Tony was very sensitive, introverted . Well , l would see him quite a lot. And he would stay to my place, lived there for a while, got an apartment around the corner. And then l would go back East. L 'd say with Tony at his place. L knew that he was very dedicated to being an actor in Hollywood . And the most promising male star of tomorrow is the fine young actor, Tony Perkins. TAB H uNTER: Tony was very concerned about his image and doing the right thing . They would go to a lot of pains not to be seen together. TAB H uNTER: At first, when Tony and l used to go out, we would go out together. But he would get recognized . L would get recognized . He felt very uncomfortable. L always did too because the idea of two young actors around together might start some talk. (sl NG l NG) Yes, l ' m in love. Don 't tell a soul . TAB H uNTER (sPEAKl NG): Natalie wood and l would go to a premiere. Then we'd go to Ciro's afterwards. We' d be photographed dancing. Then we would leave, and she'd go out the back door. She'd have a date with Dennis Hopper. And l 'd go see Tony. (sl NG l NG) shh , don 't let it get around. (sPEAKl NG) Tony and l did go on couple dates together. Tab and Tony and l went out together. L suppose l was a beard . But l was happy to be a beard because we were having a good / l knew the game, and we were playing it. L n the fan magazines there would being a picture of Tab and l . And then in the next page there'd be a picture of Tony and l doing something else, but never just Tab and Tony. (sl NG l NG) shh , don 't let it get around. L did feel that Tab and Tony had a real relationship. L could see them together. But it was a painful relationship, at least for Tony. Tony was more in love with Tab than Tab was with him . Whenever Tab and Tony got into a fight, Tony would come to my house and cry on my shoulder about how mean Tab was. My relationship with Tony, l never discussed with anyone. And if one of my so-called friends or my friends would mention it, l probably would have gone berserk. L would have hated it and denied it emphatically-- (ExPLOslON sOuN D) where l could blow it up very quickly. Tony, as the audience ovation indicates, your career is certainly going full steam ahead. Tony was on his way to being a pretty big star. Tony' s career was most important to him , more than anything . He could be extremely charming. But l think he had a hidden agenda, as far as his career was concerned . You never really knew Tony 1 00o%c . There was always a secretive side, and he was a bit of a game player with people' s minds. Can 't you see it' s a brush-off? They' re trying me out at a position . They know l can 't play it! J ust as soon as l make a few errors, they' re gonna drop me! Can 't you see it? TAB H uNTER: The first live television show l did was " Fear strikes Out. " l played J immy Piersall. He was a ball player who had mental problems. Tony caught my performance and told me how m uch he liked it. L confided in Tony that l wanted warner Brothers to buy the project for me to make a movie out of it. One evening we were playing ping pong on a terrace, and he said , oh , by the way, Paramount just bought " Fear strikes Out" for me. And it just was like, whoa. He had mentioned it to the studio, and they got it for him . He was a very ambitious young man and a very fine actor and he should be working . But l did feel betrayed by that move. When, Jimmy-- when that's all you ever cared about. And you ' re killing me. You 've been killing me for years. Yes, you have. And it's too much . He was very good in the film . But our relationship was strained after that. He told me that his studio didn 't want him to see me anymore. We saw less and less of each other, and we just sort of grew apart. " Damn Yankees" was a huge Broadway hit. Jack warner bought " Damn Yankees" for me. It was the first really good project for me from warner Brothers. Jack warner brought in the whole New York cast, except for the lead , and he wanted me to do that. L was the only outsider in it. It needed some sparkle, which he had . What' s the story on this kid? This Tab H unter was like a breath of spring. Wow! The director was George Abbott. He didn 't want me at all . He wanted Don M urray. Warner said , l want you to the use Tab H unter. He' s the biggest star at my studio. Every one of his pictures is popular. Tab was certainly at the top of his game. George Abbott and l did not get along. The first time l met him was at the read through. The whole New York cast was sitting there. And after l read a few lines, he said , l want you to read it like this. And he gave me a line reading , which actors do not like. L want to exercise the escape clause which is to take place on the 24th , which is today. So l read it the way he wanted me to. We went on , and he stopped me about two or three or four times. And finally, l just had had enough . So l stopped , and l said , Mr. Abbott, from what l gather, you ' d like me to do it the way stephen Douglas did it on Broadway. He said , yes, yes. That's exactly what l would like. L said , well, l thought stephen Douglas had a magnificent voice, but l thought he was a real stick. If l play the character, first of all , he's got to be human being. That was the wrong thing to tell him . Oh , l ' m honest, but, uh , l ' m dumb too. He closed his script, said, thank you all very much . He got up and left the room , and l was fired off the picture. Jack warner went to Abbott and said , l bought it for Tab H unter. Tab H unter' s going to do it. You don 't say no to Jack warner. OK, you win . Get a uniform . - You mean it? -L mean it. -wow! L made it! (LAuGH l NG) so l did the film , but it was difficult, knowing that he'd never wanted me right from the start. (sl NGl NG) whatever Lola wants, Lola gets. And Gwen verdon-- Gwen always called me like a New York cab driver-- Tab H untah . (LAuGH l NG) l loved it. The choreographer was Bobby Fosse. You can 't get any better than that. Bobby Fosse made me look like l could dance, even though l have two left feet. And he said , don 't worry about it, Tab. You ' ll be fine. You see, Mr. , uh , Mr.-- uh , Hardy-- uh , Joe Hardy. L just felt like l wanted to take him in my arms. Well , he was perfect for the role. He was delicious in it, and l think that Mr. Abbott was very very satisfied with him ultimately. All right, a carton of winstons, and Tab, thanks a million. - Thank you very m uch. He was always, always trying to be better. Probably at that time his looks got in the way a bit. L 've had a great evening . really l have. L ' ll never forget it. The era that Tab got kind of stuck in was that era when we were all very attracted to the Brando angst and the Jimmy Dean angst. You ' re tearing me apart! TAB H uNTER: warner Brothers had Jimmy as the rebel , and they had me as the all-American boy. So they had their bases covered . They did discuss me for the J immy Dean role in " Rebel without a Cause. " Can you imagine that? (LAuGH l NG) He didn 't get the opportunities with some of those parts that he could 've done very well . And they were terribly com plicated people. And one of the great assets of Tab H unter was the fact that he didn 't look like a terribly complicated person. You know, it' s a curse and it's a blessing to have that kind of career where they think that you are that infectious smile or you are that person that jumps off the screen to them . Tab had a very difficult time trying to prove that behind this face there really is a talent. ANNOuNCER: Playhouse 90, tonight starring Tab H unter. TAB H uNTER: The director Arthur Penn said , there's a great script l 've just read . It was called " Portrait of a Murderer. " He said , will you do it? L said , oh , l don 't think so. Live television? That would clear the hell out of me. L was awfully guilty of saying , l can 't do that, or l ' m afraid to do this. But you 've just got to go (sPLAsH l NG sOuND) take the plunge. ANNOuNCER: " Portrait of a Murderer, " directed by Arthur Penn. It was the true story of Donald Bashor a man who committed burglaries and murdered these people. It was a very powerful piece of material. Put than back right now. L ' m calling the police. You ' re going to get arrested for breaking and-- ah! Oh! He was frightening-- really frightening . He played it so well because it seemed to be going against his own persona. Here was Geraldine page from the Actor's studio in New York. It was a whole different way of working. Tab kept up with her. But l don 't want to bring you bad luck. Bad luck? You ' re my good luck, my best luck. This was big time. This wasn 't just some teenage heartthrob who got a break. Oh , l was proud of that show. It was a good show. Television was giving me the opportunity to do things that l could not do in motion pictures, with the most creative people in the industry, directors like sidney Lumet, John Frankenheimer, really good actors and actresses and good writers. L loved live television. ANNOuNCER: Tab H unter. Then it started to click, where he was getting cast in things that made sense, and he was no longer a joke. Come on! Just me brand them . L told you to put that gun away. Yes, sir. L 'd played heavy on television but never in a film . It just was such a good character. It's a pathetic. From now on, l ' m going my own way, me, Ed Hackett. He' s a complete psychopath . L ' m giving you an order. You can go to hell! He' s a racist. You mean to tell me you 'd marry that no-good half breed? He' s a murderer. Mister, you made a mistake in pulling that gun. He' s just waiting to explode. Of all the films l 've done, " Gunman 's walk" was some of my best work as an actor. After " Gunman 's walk, " Hollywood started to see me in a new way. L started getting cast in some very nice productions-- "They Came to Cordura, " with Gary Cooper and Rita Hayworth , "The Pleasure of H is Company, " with Fred Astaire and Debbie Reynolds, "That Kind of woman , " with sophia Loren. These wonderful films were not being made at warner Brothers, where l was under contract. Warners would loan me out for like $250,000 a picture. Then they would pay me my regular warner Brothers weekly salary, and they would pocket the difference. L was getting a little upset about that. The two films that Natalie and l did together were both big hits. So the studio went and put us together in another film . Well , l read the script, and l thought, l can 't do this. L turned it down because l knew what l liked, knew what l didn 't like, and l wanted to grow. L ' m not a puppet. So l asked the studio for my release. Well , needless to say, Jack warner wasn 't about to have that happen. And l said , well , Mr. warner, how much would it cost? And he said , if you want out, you pay us $1 00,000 fcr the remainder of your contract. That was a lot of money, like a couple m illion today. But to express myself and be my own person, l figured , l 've got to do it. Products of Hollywood are interchangeable and ultimately replaceable. Get outta here, Dad. If you weren 't half drunk l 'd throw you out. Troy Donahue was a young actor. He was one of Henry's clients. Actually, Henry wilson tried to stick me with that name before they gave me Tab H unter. Warner Brothers was trying to make Troy Donahue in the image of Tab H unter. They started building Troy's career and have him a very good career. You 've been a good old wagon , but you done broke down . (wH lsTLl NG sOuN D) You ' re out, and somebody else is in there. Leaving warner Brothers was career suicide. L thought there'd be opportunity for me at other studios, but that was not the case. The days of studio contracts were over. L was now a freelance actor on my own, and my primary concern was taking care of my mother. L had a lot of responsibilities. And it was tough to keep your head above water. L would do anything to pay down my debt. ANNOuNCER: " Operation Bikini , " starring Tab H unter. My career was really drying up in Hollywood . So l would take whatever was available. L was no longer looking for the keys to the kingdom . ANNOuNCER: "The Golden Arrow, " starring Tab H unter. Well , not many actors can say that they rode a flying carpet. When you have to live and you need a job, you ' ll accept what's there. ANNOuNCER: Tab H unter in a dual role as a heroic security officer and a treacherous enemy agent. " Birds Do lt, " with soupy sales, that's a winner. ANNOuNCER: Tab H unter is steamer. He goes all the way for everything Hawaiian. To this day, people are still coming up and saying , oh , l loved you in all those beach movies! L only did one. That was " Ride the wild surf. " Everybody kept thinking of me as this surfer. And at that point, l felt that l was a little long in the tooth for that one. L was 32 at the time. They would have a son a little Red Flyer wagon on our knees with process shot behind us of this mountainous wave. And then a prop man would be in front of us with a bucket of water going splash-splash , splash-splash . Someone point me toward the nearest bank. This was called paying the bills and keep working . That' s what it's all about. ANNOuNCER: "The Tab Hunter show-- " The television series that l did, this was bottom of the barrel. But that' s impossible. This so-called comedy wound up with a director who would say to us, come on , come on . Faster! Faster! Fast is funny, but faster is funnier. When do you meet her? Right now. It was really bad stuff. The bloom came off the rose. My career was going (wH lsTLl NG sOuN D). Beat it, Tab. Can 't you see l ' m busy? Without the protection of the studio, my boy-next-door image was in total free fall . People could say and write what they wanted , and they did . If l had still been under contract, they'd have nailed it like that. L was sick of Hollywood , sick of the media, and l had just about lost faith in everything. As l was doing films, l would always run back to the stable. The thing about being alone on a horse, it helps you divorce yourself from yourself because you ' re working with an animal that has a life of its own. It's a marriage that's quite marvelous. L found that my touch of reality in that unrealistic world of Hollywood . He was riding a jumper. L was in awe of him because of how he rode. L was standing at the back gate, and we just started talking . L didn 't know who he was. And he asked me questions like, do l ride? And l said, oh, yeah , l grew up on a horse. He said , do you ride jumping horses? And l said , no, l 've not done that, but the thought appeals to me. And he said , l 'd be willing to teach you some jumping . So l took him up on it. And so we became friends after that. He didn 't have all the trappings, l didn 't think, that a star would have. He was very real person. It was the first long-term relationship that l ever had. We were together for about seven years. Hollywood turned their back on him . And l realized what it must be like to be very popular and to be very unpopular. L certainly commiserated with him . But he didn 't ever want to talk about it much . ANNOuNCER: Tab has been out of town for a while. Now he's back, just horsing around , waiting for the day he's discovered again. L was very concerned . So l bought space in "variety" to just tell people hello. Is there any possibility of you getting job somewhere around here? L just wanted people to know that l wasn 't dead , that l ' m still alive. And a couple responses-- really sweet people-- said , yeah, get lost, or yeah, drop dead . Tab H unter, who was every high school girl 's idea of a dream boat-- he was a boy who never seemed to get any older. Well , he has. Well , l might as well have been a relic from the silent era because people wanted real people in real situations, no more Hollywood made-up personas. We want to be free to ride our machines without being hassled by the man . TAB H uNTER: The new actors were anti-establishment, and l was apple pie and All-American. It would have taken some director to give him the kind of a part that would make everybody look at him in a new way. L n order to make the change, he would have had to do something really radical. This was a low-budget horror film-- --made on a show string. It needed a very handsome debonair man who would love women to death. Tab H unter would be the last person you would expect to do that. TAB H uNTER: "sweet Kill " was certainly way out there. L did it because the movie roles were just not coming along . Tab was so much a part of that Eisenhower era. The '50s, as an era, was repudiated in the '80s. Young people are the only people in this whole country that have saved the soul of America. It was a completely changed world . America was at war with itself as well as at war with vietnam . My brother was in military medical evacuations. He had joined the Navy. He wound up in vietnam , as so many young men did. L was at a horse show at the Cow Palace in san Francisco. And l was sitting on my horse at the back gate waiting for the announcer to announce my horse Nob H ill and myself for the next entry into the arena. And l saw a man in military uniform coming , and he walked over to me, and he said , are you Art Gelien? L just want to tell you your brother was killed in vietnam . L thought, why him? Why not me? Walt was married, and he had seven children . L remember taking the moment, closing my eyes, and saying , walt, l ' m gonna win this class for you. And my horse won the class that night. And then afterwards l went back to the barn . And when l was in the stall with my horse, l totally lost it. L was scared of my own shadow. My brother was the one who opened the doors of life for me. L really looked up to him so much . My mother was very stoic about my brother's death. She was getting better, but it took a while. L was very concerned about her well-being , and l would see her a great deal more than l had when l was running around with the movies. L found her a little apartment in Long Beach. Whatever she need , l would be there for her. Well , l made a promise to my mother to take care of her. And l definitely was going to keep it. L had to create work in some way. L discovered dinner theater. Dinner theater was a place where people could come and stuff their faces, then sit back, and while they were getting to belch , watch the show they you were doing . (LAuG H l NG) They were becom ing very, very popular. There was a stigma attached to working dinner theaters. They said that it was the place that old actors went to die. L was making more money at dinner theater than l was waiting for a picture now and then in Hollywood , that' s for sure-- six weeks here, eight weeks there, four weeks here, all over the country. L felt l had to keep going once you put yourself in that gear. L was on the road constantly. L NTERvl EwER: Your story in " Here Lies Jeremy Troy, " which is at the Grand Dinner Theater in Anaheim-- That' s right. We' ll be there for eight weeks. It's right opposite the entrance to Disneyland . It' s a very lonely, lonely existence. You perform in front of 1 ,500 people, and you go home to a hotel room in the middle of nowhere by yourself. Working at dinner theater was very exhausting . And doing that every single night took a toll on me. L wore myself right into the ground to the point of where l had a heart attack. L was sure that it could be the end . L was wondering if l was going to be able to make it, and l was praying a lot. L did give up dinner theater after that. L learned to try to relax a bit. L learned to be grateful for every moment and thankful-- thankful . L love the church . L love my religion . But l still just felt like l was such an outcast because of my sexuality. It took a long time for me to find my way back. It was so peaceful , and it was so important that l try to be a part of it. And l struck up a conversation with a priest who l felt l can really communicate with. L told him l was a Catholic, and l told him l had some terrible reservations. He was so receptive. And he really made me feel better about myself. He was discovering something about his own truth. For a man to have to live in someone else's presuming about who you should love, how do you ever know yourself? He was going to go where his heart told him to go. By going back to my church and my beliefs, that really, really helped me through a very difficult period . And little by little, l just felt the weight of the world was lifted from me. L knew Tab is an image, you know? And that was the thing that was so very important to me and why l so much wanted him to be in Polyester. " lt's Todd , honey. Todd? Todd Tomorrow? John waters called me up on the telephone and said , l 've got a script l ' d like you to read for a film with Divine. What do you think, sweetheart? Oh , it's very high brow, Todd . And then he said , how would you feel about kissing a (LAuGH l NG) And l just said , l ' m sure l 've kissed a hell of a lot worse. John 's films were outrageous. L prayed that he would never go watch " Pink Flamingos. " Happy birthday, fatso. Oh! And he did . How could anyone be filthier than Divine? Even then , he didn 't say, oh , well , never mind . He was unafraid. L remember an agent saying to me at the time, you can 't do that film . And my response was, what have l got to lose? Where's my career now? L thought this will be a lot of fun. Why don 't you show me your bedroom , honey? Mother may l ? Yes, you may. Ooh! L could only afford him for one week. L ' m sure it was the least Tab H unter was ever paid , and it was by far the most l had ever paid anybody. Doing a film for John , you got to find a spot on the floor where you can sit down between takes-- cold pizza at 2 :00 AM . (LAuG H l NG) Are you my little flesh pot? Mm-hmm . It was the first time ever we had quote, "a real movie star" come in and work with my movie stars. Tab made out with Divine who was in drag . People could not believe their eyes. That' s why the movie worked because they together were a great screen couple. A couple of people said , oh, don 't worry about it. Nobody' s gonna see this film . The movie came out. It was a hit. And it definitely revitalized my career. Mr. Tab H unter, yay! Well , there was a whole new audience that never heard of Tab H unter. Now, what is the best time of the month for a woman to conceive? L feel like a new old face or an old new face. So l ' m getting my toe in the door to start all over again. It's very exciting Tab was serious about his career. But he never took himself that seriously. DR. ERNO: Tab, what do you do for a living? Well , Erno, l ' m a Hollywood movie star, and l 've been in over 40 films, and l lived in Beverly H ills. That sounds exciting . He found himself amusing . When you have a sense of humor about yourself, people appreciate you in another way. L wanted to work with Divine again. L had come up with the idea of doing a western comedy. It was called " Lust in the Dust. " ANNOuNCER: Tab H unter is the stranger. And Divine is Rosy valdez. Come and get it. L turned over every stone l possibly could trying to get " Lust in the Dust" going forward . The first time l saw Tab in person was when he walked into my office at Fox to pitch " Lust in the Dust. " Tab still had that star quality. And l mentioned the project to Allan. And he hit on it right away and said , what a wonderful idea. Once Tab left the meeting , l thought, yeah, " Lust in the Dust" could work. L knew l could trust him almost immediately. L found Allan very attractive, very bright, and l wanted to spend more time with him . Tab started calling me. And l thought initially it was just a follow up about " Lust in the Dust, " but it went beyond that. Tab was 30 years older and l was. L was 23. Tabb was 53. But once we did connect, l couldn 't imagine us not being together. And then the more our personal relationship grew, the more l was determ ined to get that movie done. L tried to get it going at Fox, and there was a little bit of interest, but they ultimately passed on it. Tab said to me l should get involved and produce this. Well , that would mean having to leave my secure job at Fox, which l did. People told me l was taking a big risk leaving the studio. But l had a hunch that my future would be better with Tab, so l left. He single-handedly raised all the money for that film . You got it all wrong , honey. You 've been cheap all your life. Cheap? L was the sister of Divine. This furniture is cheap. L looked like a drag queen , you know? (LAuGH l NG) l think that was the idea. My love scene with Tab H unter-- we were in a shower. It was delicious. The first film l ever appeared in was " Lust in the Dust. " That set, in particular, had a real sense of frivolity and fun about it. And l remember being struck by Tab' s naturalism and how effortlessly everything he was doing was com ing across. Victory shifts from man to man . Deuteronomy? Homer. Everybody was sort of playing it larger than life. " Lust in the Dust" was well received , and it certainly opened doors for us to do other things. ALLAN GLAsER: Tab definitely had a value. L got a lot of meetings just because Tab was attached . We were doing these independent projects, and Tab' s celebrity helped me raise the financing . It was a very productive time for us. For me, it was a challenge to make it work, which l enjoyed . But not so m uch for Tab. He didn 't find that same excitement that l found in trying to get these projects going . Well , l never paid a lot of attention what was happening in Hollywood . L let Allan do all of that because he was really good at it. How are you? Tab H unter. By this time, Tab wasn 't too happy to continue acting . Tab was still getting offers, but he turned 90o%c of everything he was offered down . People were coming out, and that was their choice to do so, and l respect that. Personally, l didn 't want my sexuality to define who l was. L just didn 't talk about. It's not my comfort zone. L was point-blank asked about my sexuality. Wasn 't it difficult to be in a closet? Some of the press occasionally would cross that boundary, l ' m entitled to have that line there, and if l don 't want to share that with you , l won 't. L think it probably means l finally made it. L mean , you can 't be a star without having a gay rumor out there, can you? (LAuGH l NG) l n some respects, the business is still like it was in the ' 50s. It may be a lot more socially acceptable to be gay. But l know several people who are very prominent in this industry who feel, perhaps legitimately, that if they came out it would affect their box office appeal . Let's put it this way, fellas, a Gillette shave turns a trick. For someone who is the fantasy for women all across America and the world , to come out in the public and say, l ' m gay and expect to play leading men is an issue. It's still tricky. Every actor who has a secret, like being gay, there's a part of us that are afraid of Hollywood . We' re afraid to be who we are com pletely. That' s a hard life to lead. After decades of being in the public eye, all l wanted was my privacy. L n order to achieve that, l just withdrew from it all for good . My life had been very transient. L never thought of settling down . But then Allan came into my life and just opened up whole new vistas. We' re so much of a part of each other now because we have been together for so long . And it's just one of those things. It works. Allan 's a very stabilizing influence. L have a wonderful relationship with Allan that's grown over 30-some years. This is really an incredible person that l want to spend my life with. What brings Tab pleasure on a daily basis, and l can sum it up in one word , is Harlow. This old cow, look at her. ALLAN G LAsER: Harlow, Tab's horse, is what gives Tab joy. This is what makes me happiest. This is where l really feel more at ease than l would anywhere else. It's getting up in the morning, having to go clean out that stall , having to groom that horse. Whoa, listen to your belly growl! That sounds like a pretty good life-- riding horses and just kind of cooling his heels. OK move your tush , sweetheart. He' s a better man than l am . L try to stay away from anything weighing 1 ,400 pounds and has a brain the size of a walnut. When you have a passion that fulfills you , you don 't look to other areas to fill you up. Tab is an incredible horseman and always has been, and that is a career in itself. Well , my acting career l look at as being all in the past. L loved it, bud l love where l am now in my life. And l am happy to be forgotten . Tab' s attitude to his Hollywood career is been there, done that. He calls it his past life, which drives me nuts. L found this is at flea market. It' s something that he could em brace, but he doesn 't care to do it. He did it. He let go of it. He doesn 't even want to see himself on television . If he's laying in bed and an old movie of his comes on , he doesn 't stop for one second . Forget it. ALLAN GLAsER: He just flips through the channel like it was a dog food commercial and keeps going. Well , a-- a boy' s best friend is his mother. We were casting " Lust in the Dust, " and there was this character named Hardcase williams. And l thought Tony Perkins would be perfect for that role. ANNOuNCER: 22 years later, Norman Bates is home. " Psycho l l " had just come out. Tony was getting a tremendous amount of publicity. Tab was having a career resurgence at the same exact time Tony Perkins was. He said , Tony Perkins-- do you know him? (LAuGH l NG) l said , yeah , Allan , l know him . (LAuGH l NG) l contacted Tony, went up to his house up on Mulholland . L hadn 't seen him in a long while. H is wife Mary answered the door. Tony had married , had a family. And l presented Tony with the script. And he said he really would like to do it, but he just didn 't think it was the right project for him at the time. And Tony and l said goodbye that afternoon , and that was the last time that l saw Tony. Al Ds has taken the life of actor Anthony Perkins. He died saturday at his Los Angeles home. L never felt that Tony was struggling with his identity. And when l did hear of it, l was really quite surprised . Maybe he was deep down unhappy with himself about being gay and wanted to change that. H is choice was right for him , and it's all part of a person 's growth . Tony was who he was, or maybe he wanted to be. That was good enough for me. L had no right-- no one does-- to be judgmental or to second guess his pursuit of happiness. There are an awful lot of people who have feelings, and they' re in conflict with themselves. And it's a terribly difficult thing to have to go through . L think you have to be true to yourself. My mother never said l love you a lot. But she' d show it when you 'd least expect it. My mother and l are sitting on the back terrace having breakfast one morning after church . And she leaned over and kissed me on the cheek and said , l love you very much . L was in a good place with her. L know that. And she was in a good place with me. L miss her. There' s something well-grounded about Tab. That's why he's lasted all these years is that he' s real . He' s like the earth. He' s solid . He's happy in his own special way to live his life, and he' s had a happy life. He chose that right road .
