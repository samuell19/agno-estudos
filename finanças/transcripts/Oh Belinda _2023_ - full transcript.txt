DİLARA BAŞARAN - [children yelling faintly] - [loud banging upstairs] [exasperated sigh] - [music ends] - [cat meows] [birds chirping] [woman reading] "The Gülverens. Handan, a housewife with a son, and a daughter." "By day, she works at the bank, and by night, she stuffs bell peppers at home." "A good wife to her husband, and a good mother to her kids." "Every night she takes a shower with Belinda to wash away the exhaustion of the day." [vehicle horn honking in distance] - Easy, easy. - Stop pushing! Let go of that! - Stop pushing each other. - Get out of the way! [woman 2] Get in the car properly, come on. - [car door closes] - Hi. Good day to you. Uh, you, too. Hey, I'm sorry to tell you this, but do you think your little angels could play a little less loudly, please? It's making it hard to focus while trying to memorize lines. [chuckles] Thank you. Certainly, and by the way, do you think you could have sex a little less loudly? Because, you know, it makes it hard for us to sleep. Thank you. - Okay... - [door slams] [vehicle starts] Dude, I thought this was a shampoo commercial. You just take your bathrobe off, a couple of below-the-ass shots, a couple of above-the-ass shots, bite your lip and give the camera a sexy stare, and you're done. I mean, who stuffs bell peppers in a shampoo commercial? What is that about? [woman on phone] t's a new brand. I told you about this. Oh love, love, yeah, I know you told me that this was a new brand, but you didn't tell me that the owners were dried nuts manufacturers. You said Timo was directing, and Belinda was the brand. None of these were disclosed before we signed the contract. [sarcastically] Wonderful, really. I mean, good for us. [normally] So, this is our first commercial, and you're okay with us giving that message to people? In the day, you have to work your ass off, then you have to go home, do some chores, some ironing, house cleaning, and stuff some bell peppers, be a good wife to your husband, and a good mother to your kids. You know what, fuck this! And... [woman on phone] Yeah, but listen, honey, all I'm saying is this is a job... [woman] Did you hear what she said? Okay, Ayca, it's okay. Listen, this has gone far enough. I mean, I don't want to play the life of a shitty family who go to picnics on weekends and make barbecues. We should just compensate and get out of this. [woman on phone] Honey, that would be 750,000 liras. How can we pay that? - Is that the actual amount? - Yeah, that is the actual amount. I swear we'd be ruined, totally ruined. Fine, what time are we shooting tomorrow? Early in the morning, I suppose. Okay, but that bell pepper stuff... Dilara, I have to go, honey, but I'll call you later, okay? Kisses. [upbeat music playing in bar] [man] Okay, but did you ask the director all the necessary questions? Like, you know, what's the intrinsic motivation for this Handan character? Do you know the magnitude of her character's spectrum? These are important. You learn anything new about yourself from this Handan character? Did you find out her spirit animal or something? - [laughs] - Huh? - [laughs] - Hey, don't talk shit at her. She's a professional, first she works on the character development. [woman] You need to do that. - I got you. - [woman] Hang on a second. Dilara, seriously, aside from everything, I have a serious question for you. Can you relate to someone like Handan? I mean, what are you gonna do? Have you, like, gone to a pepper stuffing class or something ridiculous like that? [laughs] [forced laugh] - Guys, guys, guys, - [man 2] What? I wish that you would be a tad, just a tad more serious about your careers. - That's all. - Whoa... Ah, okay, never mind that, forget about being serious, but maybe you could at least read your lines before you show up? What? "Oh right, what was it? What was my line?" [chuckles] Oh, love, we're just messing with you. This is all friendly jealousy, believe me. [kisses] [music continues] - [whispers indistinctly] - I'll see you soon. Way to go, Serkan. - You haven't lost time telling everyone. - Come on, honey, we were just playing. - You should chill, really. - All right, Serkan. The shampoo thing is over. I don't want to hear about it. You just keep having fun. - Hey, come on. Cheers, everyone. - Yes, cheers! [both laughing] [birthday song playing] - Oh, you did this? - Happy birthday, Dilara. You did this! [woman] Happy birthday to you, Dilara! [song continues] - Happy birthday, Dilara! - [man] Happy birthday. May all your wishes come true. BELİNDA HAPPY BIRTHDAY! OUR MAGICAL CELEBRITY! [song fades] [Serkan] Baby, don't you think this has gone on too long? I apologized to you over and over again. [Dilara sighs] The cake wasn't my idea. It was all Arzu's. Hey, are you sleeping with Arzu? Oh, come on! Look, I won't get mad at you if you are. But if you're lying to me, I'll kick your ass, Serkan. Stop it, Dilara, please, just stop. She is jealous of everything about me! Every single thing! She's jealous about you, jealous about the parts I play. Know what she said to Cem the other day? She said she could play Harika much better than me. What? Like, how? That is the dumbest joke ever. [chuckles] Do you really think you could even play the shoe of Harika? I'm not even talking about the character, just the shoe! Hey, listen, don't forget to get out of character. I don't want to deal with Handan, too. [Dilara scoffs] BELİNDA YOUR FAMILY'S MAGICAL SHAMPOO [unsettling electronic music playing] - Welcome, Dilara. - We have a very makeup dry run. How about we do a quick fitting? [man] ...but we have another option. Yeah, all right. - Great. - Right this way. [indistinct chatter] - [Dilara] Timo. - Ho-hoo. Dila! Ah, Dila! [sighing] Oh, baby, oh, baby, what have we gotten ourselves into? I know, right? [imitates gunshot] We'll wrap this up quickly. - Don't worry, darling. [clicks tongue] - Fine. Let me introduce you to the kids, if you will follow me. - [Timo] I'll see you later. Get ready. - Be right with you. [woman] They will be playing Mehmetcan and Ayşegül. Figures. Oh, Dilara. We all love you. Thank you. Guys, meet your play-mom. We call you play-mom to avoid any confusion. - Hmm. - [girl] Hello. Hello, play-mom. [robotically] Hello. [normally] Huh. Good for you. Dilara. Yup. Hi. Oh, how nice of you to invite me in. Seriously, we've been watching the roads for your arrival with our hearts in our hands. [chuckles] How are you, are you okay? - [chuckles] - Oh. I'm Necati, your husband. Well, I mean, by husband I mean, um, I'm Tuncay, - I play, I play Necati, your husband. - Mm. You know? [chuckles] Can we just take... - Oh. - Yeah, we should have a memory of our own. - Come closer. Okay. - [camera clicking] Could you, maybe, calm down a little? - Give me some space. - Damn. - Over here, please. - It's off. Oh shit. Oh, the make-up. The make-up. - Here, here, please. - [Tuncay] Should I be standing? Yeah, yeah. - [woman] Turn to me. - Uh-huh. - It's done? - Go to the men's room and fix that. Go on. [Tuncay] Tuncay is gone, hail Necati. [chuckles] Um, Miss Dilara, I'll tag you and post this. Don't worry. You'll automatically see it, and you can tag me as well. I mean, - Talk to you later. Okay. Okay. - It would be great... I think we should do that because it's just not ready. What do you think? - [Timo] Yeah. - It'd be better if we do that. Sir, I'm sorry to barge into your conversation. The character analysis says that the family is originally from Central Anatolia. I think I should speak with an accent. [with accent] What you think, man? Huh? Buddy, your character doesn't have any lines. Okay. [Timo] What? Okay? He hasn't even read the script. - [Tuncay] I'm ready! - What the fuck? Hey, is everyone ready? We should start rolling! We're all ready. [Timo] Yeah. All right, people! Are we ready for Belinda? One, two, three, action! [unsettling electronic music playing] [sniffs deeply] Whoa, whoa, cut, cut! Dude, what were you smelling? She hasn't even taken a shower yet. I'm really sorry, sir. That was my bad. Cut, cut! Handan, a little gentler, please. Stop, stop, stop! Dila, darling. I need a real moment. I need you to believe that Handan adores her husband and children. A real Turkish woman! [music continues] - [Tuncay] I literally spaced out, sir. - Damn it! My bad. My bad. Let's take a tea break. Tea break! Should you be having tea right now? Three, two, one, you're on! Cut! [echoing] Once more. Once more. Once more... [shower running] [music fades] [crunching] [slurping] [exhales] Cut. That didn't happen. Once more. Guys, if you don't mind, um... I'd like anyone who's not in the scene to leave right now. Okay? Yeah, guys, please. Please, anyone not in the scene... - [woman] Follow me, please. This way. - Leave now. - Please, please. - Enjoy your shower. [sighs frustratedly] Dila. Darling, are we good? No, I'm not. Get it? The water is ice-cold. I have wrinkles all over, look at my hands, Timo. And this thing you call shampoo is no different than glue. - Wanna try again tomorrow? - No, Timo, no. We need to wrap this up now. I'm not coming back here for this shit of an experience and shampoo. - Let's get this over with. - Okay. Let's do it again. Let's do it again! [under his breath] And again. And again. You ready? I'm ready. [sighs] All right. Three, two, one, go! All right. With Belinda, you're washing the stress of the long day off you. - You feel rejuvenated. - Mmm... A refreshing... Cut. Cut! What is it now? Forget Dilara. Dilara is no more. I need Handan now. This place, this bathroom, this shampoo, they're all yours. Show me the Handan inside of you. - Hey! - [snaps fingers] - Look at me! Don't pretend to be Handan. - Mm-hmm. Handan is you. Okay? Okay. You can do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Rinse your hair. [exhales] Yes, this is it. You're Handan. You're just Handan now. [sighs] [chuckles softly] [unsettling electronic music playing] That's how you do it. [sighs happily] [music continues] [sighs] [children yelling faintly] - [boy] Give it! - [girl yelling] [soft rhythmic swooshing] [music continues] [boy faintly] I want it back! Mom! - [shower running] - [children yelling indistinctly] [washing machine swooshing steadily] [music continues] - [girl] I don't care! - [boy] Give it back! [children continue fighting] [sniffing] [sniffing] - [girl] It's mine! - [boy] Give it back! [music continues] [sighs] [children fighting indistinctly] [boy] I want it now! Give it to me now! Give it back, it's mine! No! Give it to me. Give it back! I want it. - [girl] Mom! - [boy] Give it back! - [laser sounds] - [gasps] [boy] Give it back! Give it back! - Give it back! - [girl] I will not give it back! - I will not! - [gun making laser sounds] Monkey! Monkey! Monkey! Monkey! Monkey! Timo? [kids yelling] [girl] Monkey! Monkey! - Monkey! Monkey! - [Dilara] Timo? [laser gun sounds] Monkey! Monkey! Monkey! Monkey! Monkey! Monkey! Monkey! Monkey! [woman speaking indistinctly] [man on TV] Here you go. [woman on TV] Have a good day. Give me back my snake! Give me back my snake! Get out of my way! [boy] I will not! Give me back my car! [girl] I will not! You said you would give me... [Dilara clears throat] I will not let you go through with this. [boy] You have my car! Stop lying! [girl] I don't have it, you're the one who's lying! I'll tell Dad! [boy] I don't care! [girl] I'll tell him why. Where is everyone? Handan, honey? You took a shower this late? Why? - You think this is funny? - [girl yells] Are you making fun of me? No, I'm just playing backgammon. [woman on TV] I will take our revenge. Where are my clothes? [woman on TV] Don't you worry, I'll see you again soon. [Necati] Handan? [Dilara] Timo! You got garbage to take out, ma'am? [Necati] Handan! What are you doing? What are you doing? Why would you even open the door with just a bath robe on? Huh? - Have you gone wild? - [chanting] Mom's gone wild... Guys, all right, shh, shut up. Shut up, you. Shut up. Handan, what's wrong, huh? Um, okay, listen, this is all good, and funny, and we had a few laughs, but I'm really starting to lose it, Mr. Tuncay. Really. Who the heck is Tuncay? - Mr. Necati, listen, I really... - What? Mister? Enough! Stop this stupid shit of a joke, right now! Where is everybody? Where's the crew, huh? Where's the lighting guy? Man, where's the director? The producers? Where is everyone? What have you done, you knocked me out with that stupid shampoo? God help us. God help us with what? - No... - Where is everyone? [boy] Dad, she's yelling at me. Honey, everyone will be back. You just need to calm down. Okay, just wait, it's okay. Everything's okay, Handan. Okay, you just wait here. Come on, come on, kids. Come on, son, come, baby. Go to your room at once. You should keep quiet, though, okay? Go. Okay? Go to your room. Go, go, go, go, go. Quickly, go. [unsettling music continues] Handan? Handan, what are you doing? - What are you doing? - Have you lost your mind? - Stop this now, Mr. Tuncay. - What are you doing? - For God's sake! Stop this now! - Let go of me! How could you go outside practically naked? - Handan, calm down! - Fuck you! What are you doing, man? What the hell are you doing? [panting] To hell with your joke, with this job, and with you! Where the hell are my clothes? Huh? Where are my clothes? Handan, you bathed with your swimsuit on? Hey, look at me, I'll rip you a new one! Where are my clothes? I'll rip you a new one! I'll start yelling, you creep! Okay, Handan, honey, calm down, I'll get them. I swear I will. Just wait here, Handan, and... and stay still. - Move! Move! - Okay. Okay. Okay. Handan, don't move. Honey, don't go outside, okay? Please don't go out on the balcony. Here you go. Here you go, honey. Here, here you go, they're both here. - They're all here. - What are these? You asked for your clothes, the ones you were wearing. This is one piece, and this is the other. I got both of them and came back. Okay, get out, I'll get changed. Handan, are you really embarrassed of me? Huh? Fuck you, you shit, get out of my way. [Necati] Hey, Handan? Handan? [door slams] Handan? [Dilara] Here you go. [ring clatters] - Handan? Handan, what are you doing? - Fuck you, and your Handan, damn it! For God's sake! Where are you going? Han... Yeah, for God's sake, give our regards to them, Handan, honey. Okay? Cool. Be careful. Call me when you get there. She's going to my mom's. She misses my mom. I can't go there, you know, kids and all. Well, see you, then. - [panting] - [unsettling music continues] [gasps softly] [vehicle starts] To Levazim, please. [Necati] Handan! Handan! Handan! Handan! I'll come back with the money, man. [banging on door] [Serkan] Hey, you're gonna break down the door! Pay the cabby, please. [exasperated sigh] - Fucking shampoo! - What the fuck... I knew it in my bones that this was a shit job. Who uses stuffed peppers in a shampoo commercial? [exhales] Fucking messed up. [Serkan] Hey, what's this about? Huh? [sighs] I swear, I can sleep for a month, Serkan. Please, don't wake me up, okay? Who are you, lady? Wow, this is really something. People are barging into the homes of anyone they see on TV, is that it? Get up, come on, or I'll call the police. Uh, wow. [chuckles] So, you're in on this, too, huh? I didn't fall for it, Serkan, I didn't. Come on, this has gone on for too long. Go ahead, pay the cabby, pay the guy. Who is shouting here? I woke up in a panic. [suspenseful electronic music playing] Didn't I give you permission to do anything you want as long as you don't lie to me? - [Arzu] Serkan, who's this woman? - Who the hell are you? Who do you think you are? =Whoa, whoa, whoa. And you're wearing my nightgown! We need to make one more stop, sir. Just drive. I'll come back with your money. Thank you. [funk music playing] We can arrange that. Yeah. - Here you go. - Thanks. [sighs] Here you go, ma'am. Enjoy. I want you tell me the truth, I promise I won't get mad. Okay? Were you all aware that Serkan was sleeping with Arzu? Uh... Ma'am, it's not only us, the entire press and tabloid community knows that they're together. Oh, shit. Wow. Wow. Good for you. Levent, I need 200 lira. The cab is waiting outside, I need to pay the guy. Uh... I think we're moving a little too fast here. Let's get acquainted first. I'm Levent. Levent, which acquaintance are you talking about, huh? Dude, it's me, Dilara. I don't know you, dear. Hey, guys, that's enough, stop it, please. This is fucking annoying. Cem, say something for God's sake! Lady, we've just finished our rehearsals, and we're all going home after a few drinks. Yes, Cem, but this is our thing. Well, we don't know you, we don't know who you are. - This is our thing. - We don't know you. So, let's get you up, now, okay? - Get your hands off me! - What the hell? - Calm down. - What do you think you're doing? What kind of trick are you playing? What's your endgame? - [waiter] I have to ask you to leave. - Want to drive me mad? Goddamn it! Get your hands off me. Get the fuck away from me. - [Levent] Whoa! - [woman gasps] - You took a seat without asking. - So sorry. - [Dilara] Enough! - Enough what? - Get out of my way! - [driver] I'm waiting for my customer. It's not vacant. Don't you get it? Habibi. Habibi! Habibi. It's my cab, back off. [woman] God damn you. He did, sis, he already did. Step on it, go. Lady, if you don't have any money... Why would I use a cab unless I have money? We're going home, anyway. I have money at home. [exasperated sigh] [downbeat electronic music playing] [music continues] [gasps] [exhales] [door opening] [doorbell rings] [sighs] Hello? Apartment 8? That's right. [exhales] Apartment 8. I'm very sorry. [sighs] I... need you to drop me off where you fist picked me up, please. [melancholy music playing] [horns honking] [gulls cawing] [music ends] 373 lira, Handan. What is wrong with you, Handan? Where would a married woman go, or come back from, in the middle of the night which costs 373 lira? Huh? And you left your phone at home. I was worried sick, really sick. I swear, I don't care about the money. Really, I don't. What is wrong with you, Handan? For heaven's sake, are you all right? What's wrong? Look, you've taken this off, too. I'm begging you, I don't want to see you take this off ever again, okay? This will stay on your finger. - Ugh! We're stuck in the elevator. - [Necati] Hmm? [woman on TV] Why are you smelling me? [man on TV] Because... Because I love you, Zeynep. [woman] But you are the crown prince, are you not? [man] No, I am Fikret. Just Fikret. Ah! Handan. Ouch, Handan! My eyes are all teary. For heaven's sake, Handan, what the heck are you doing? Are you really all right? - [woman on TV] I do not love you. - [man] Zeynep? Zeynep. Would it be okay if I stay here tonight? - Have you been drinking, woman? - I'm very tired. Please. [sighs] Okay, Handan, okay, honey. Wow, this is new, Handan. Let's not do this. Please. Handan. Handan. - [door rattles] - Ow! Handan, you crushed my foot! You crushed my foot, Handan. Handan. Handan. [knocks softly] Handan, if you don't open this door, I swear I'm gonna kick your butt. I'll... [fingernails clicking] Uh, you need rest, Handan. You should rest, tonight. And we can talk about it in the morning. We can talk about it as husband and wife. [exhales forcefully] [Necati] Handan, you been drinking? No answer, huh? [sighs] [unsettling music playing] [inhales] This is a fucked-up nightmare. It will all be over in the morning. It'll be over. [exhales] It'll be over. It'll be over. [Necati] What's this? When did you have this done? Wow. And it's not coming out. What the hell's going on? How is this possible? [gasps] Woman, what is that, huh? Did you have henna applied on you? What the fuck are you doing here? What do you mean what am I doing here? This is our bedroom, honey. When did you have that done? - Last night? - Go away. Handan, you know what? It looks great. How about a morning workout? Hm? What do you think? Stop it. Stay away! Away where, woman? Wait, Handan. Five minutes. - Ah, the kids. The kids. Kids! - [shushing] - The kids will hear. - No, they will not. - [yelling] Kids! - Three minutes. Keep quiet. - Necati, stay away. - Three minutes, I'm done. - Necati, stop this, right now! - Handan, just one minute. Handan, just one minute. Handan! [Dilara] Mehmetgul! Aysecan! [Necati] Baby, put that down. Finish your egg before it gets cold. Come on. Come on. Mehmetcan, here's your egg. You have to eat bread with your sausage. Have some bread. Here, take the bread. Eat that with bread. And you need to eat bread with your sausage. [cartoon playing on tablet] I don't want to eat eggs! I don't want to eat eggs! Then eat shit! You'll eat that. Quickly. Handan, honey. Here you go. Quickly, quickly, quickly. It's still hot. Baby, for God's sake, turn that thing down! - [cartoon continues] - Mehmetcan. Go on, I want to see you eating that egg, quickly! Come on. Handan, you should have some of that or your blood pressure will drop. Hey, bastard! Eat that, damn it! Baby, please, I'm begging you to turn that thing down. Have some bread. Handan, you, too. Go, go, go, go. Quickly, everyone, finish your food. Handan, tell you what, honey. Tonight, Feride and my parents will be with us for dinner, okay? You need to cook. For God's sake, cook something. I had to make breakfast today but that's not my job. What about, that stuffed melon thing you make? My dad loves it. And before you leave the house, wipe off that henna. I mean, what the hell is that? Stop it, you jackass, let your mom eat in peace. What did I tell you? Baby, please turn that thing down! Silence! ["Aya Benzer" playing] ["Aya Benzer" continues] [song stops] [woman] Hey, Handan, where are you? You can't keep being late. The manager's been asking for you. I thought we'd have a coffee before work. Don't dally, get here quick. See you soon. I'm late for a job? Do I have a job? Ah... Handan worked at a bank. Which bank?

I'll give you another lahmacun. - [woman] And drink some airan, okay? - [Necati] Mom? [woman] Huh? You'll have to forgive us for tonight's dinner. Handan was exhausted when she came home, that's all. - Put some lemon on it. - Mmm. Why? Couldn't she even make some kisir? [Necati] Handan, honey. Mm, have one. Nice. And I'll give you some herbs too. Where did you order these from? The lahmacun place on the boardwalk? That place is amazing. Lahmacun, I don't like those. Shut up, lahmacun likes you, you have to eat. Hey, why don't you wait for my brother-in-law? What? He's parking and be here in a minute. You should eat, hey! Here, put something on it. - [mother] Eat this! - Enjoy, Daddy. [burps] [kids] Grandpa burped! [laugh] [Necati] Stop it! Mm. - [doorbell ringing] - [grunts] - He's here, go get it. - He's here, yeah. He's here, Go on, eat that. [Necati] Handan, honey, you have to eat. Eat before it gets cold, or it won't taste this good. Go on, Handan. I want to see you eat, go on. [man] Good evening, everyone. [Necati] The king of brother-in-laws! Welcome. - [sound muffles] - I am late, obviously. [mother] Handan couldn't cook anything, so we ordered lahmacuns. You are really lucky. She's exhausted. I really wore her out. Hey, I'm thirsty, give me a glass of airan, will you? You could have at least stuffed some peppers. - [indistinct muffled conversation] - [intense music playing] Handan, what's wrong with you? [music continues] - Handan? - [Feride] It's the heat. [Necati] Honey, are you okay? - No, it's the heat! - Airan. [Feride] It's this heat, I'm telling you. Are you having trouble breathing? [overlapping muffled talking] Be quiet, please. Please be quiet. Be quiet. Be quiet. - Oh, hey. - Wait. Just turn around, come on. - Quiet! - [Feride gasps] [tense music continues] [muffled talking] No way. Hey! Handan! - Her eyes rolled back! Did you see? - Bet it's the pepper! - Handan! - It's the heat! Mom, her eyes rolled back, I... [tense music continues] - [knocking on door] - Handan. Handan. Handan, honey, open up. [breathing shakily] That's enough. Stay the fuck away from me, stay the fuck away. Go away. - [banging on door] - [indistinct yelling] Please. Please. Oh, God, please. Please. [banging on door continues] [indistinct yelling] [Necati] Handan! - [indistinct talking outside door] - [gasps] [shower running] [mother] Wait. Handan, what's that sound? It's water! Handan! [indistinct yelling] [Dilara humming softly] [indistinct yelling fades] [tense music continues] It's over. [relieved sigh] [glass shattering] I mean, doc, I know what I've been telling you might sound crazy, but I swear, it's all true. Out of the blue, I found myself as Handan, the wife of that imbecile Necati. Though, I'm not her. But nobody believes me at all. I'm Dilara. Dilara Başaran. Listen, we're only here because we want to help you, - Mm. - Please, carry on with your explanation. How did you all of a sudden find yourself as Handan? [sharp inhale] Now, doctor, I am an actress. This whole thing was the script for a shampoo commercial. A commercial for a good-for-nothing shampoo called Belinda. So, one minute, I was shampooing my hair like this, and the other, I found myself in Handan's bathroom. But I am stuck here, now. I mean, no one from my old circle recognizes me anymore. Not even Serkan recognized me. Serkan? You know, that guy, the actor, Serkan Gursoy. Yeah, he's my boyfriend. I mean, he was my boyfriend. Your boyfriend. So, does your husband, Necati, know about this? Doctor, listen to be. I'm telling you I am an actress. I challenge you all! You hear me? All of you! I refuse any label you try to put on me! [panting] Bipolar! Neurotic, anorexic, borderline personality. I didn't come to this world to make you comfortable, my dear doctor. I came to this world... to live a life! To live a life! You cannot destroy my existence! You cannot stop me! Do you hear me? You cannot destroy me! You hear me? I'm not done! I'm not done yet. Mister, I'm not done. What are you doing? Mister, will you... Hey, no, no. No! - Don't stop me. No. - Calm down, stop. - I don't want him touching me! - Relax, it's okay. You cannot silence my song! - [nurse] There. - [Dilara sighs] Oh, shit. [panting] Screw you. [Necati] Wow, she's in a wheelchair. [weakly] You can't destroy who I am. I am Dilara. Dilara Başaran. Handan. - [Dilara groans] - It will be all right, honey. - I'm here for you, okay, baby? - [moans] [sobbing] And don't worry about the vase. Handan, it's okay, we'll get a new one. - Fuck your vase. - Okay, Handan, okay, honey. I just want you to get well. She's not herself at all. [ominous electronic music playing] [woman vocalizing] Tasty. Wow, this is real. Tastes sensational. Mmm! [sighs deeply] WISDOM AND REASON CAN SOLVE EVERYTHING. - ATATÜRK How is this even possible? [frustrated sigh] Metaverse. It's a wormhole. I don't follow you. You need to start negotiating, my dear. Negotiating for what? Denial. Anger. - Uh... - Negotiation. Depression. And acceptance. But you should not accept it. [laughs] Come, lady, come. Come here, come sit with me. Just what I need, damn it. Like I need a mentor, but since you're here, then wow, why not? Who are you, lady? Who the hell are you? Huh? Have you any idea what I've been through recently? Me! Worry not. Surely, there've been some downfalls, but they're not lethal. Remember, a door closes, and another one closes, too. Then another one closes as well. Keep on playing. You need to keep on playing. [exiting music playing] [doctor] So, you've completely forgotten about Dilara, Handan? Oh, God, doctor, it's all bygones ago, now. [chuckles] Then you'd like to go back to work, and your home. Yeah, yeah. I'd like to be able to do that as soon as possible, though, maybe I'll rest at home for a while. The meds were highly effective. But, obviously, they threw me off balance. I'm sure you've missed your kids, too. Oh, wow, doc, that is an understatement. Oh, how I miss to smell them. And believe me, thanks to you people, and my children, I was able to crawl out of this bottomless pit. God bless you all. Really. I was feeling my Mehmet and Gülayşe deep down in here. Right here. [Mehmetcan] Mommy, I missed you so much. Don't ever leave, again, Mommy! [kisses] - [Dilara] Okay, son. - Don't leave, again, Mommy. - I missed you so much. - Okay, son. Easy, come on. Sit down. - Go on, sit down. - He missed her. She's her mother after all. It's only natural. This type of depressive mood is very common among all of the working housewives, Dad. They call this "white collar syndrome." But thank God it's all over. Those dark days are all behind us. - What? - You think he understands you? [Mehmetcan] Mommy! - Forget about it, Dad. - My boy. Ah. All right, it's okay, son. Hey, that's enough, that's enough. - Stop it. - [Necati] Okay, come on. Go to bed. Mommy is gonna sing you "The Sack Man". "The Sack Man"? "Sack..." Could you do it, tonight, Mom? She is too exhausted for that. What? Well, she... she... Can she do anything at all? [melodically] Once upon a time, there was a Sack Man. [eerie music playing] He used to pick up the kids and throw them, and throw them into his sack. He used to sack them all the time. Oh, Sack Man, oh, Sack Man. Oh, Sack Man, oh, Sack Man. Oh, Sack Man, oh, Sack Man. Oh, Sack Man, oh, Sack Man. [sighs] Maybe I should go back to the nuthouse. Motherfucker. - Handan, honey? - [sighs] Handan, come here. Come here, I missed you so much. Necati, what are you doing here? Where else would I be, Handan, huh? My folks are asleep in the living room. Come on, Handan, please. Come on. Necati, Necati! They'll hear us. - Necati, stop it, they'll hear us! - Shh. Quiet. We'll be quiet. I swear. - Necati, please! - Handan, please, honey. Necati, I'm not feeling well. We'll be okay. We'll be okay, together. Necati I have a migraine, please. I'll massage it away, baby. I'll massage it away. Handan? You didn't wash it. Woman, you're so cute... - Hey! Hey! - Mommy. Baby! My boy! Baby, what's wrong, why are you still up? Huh, what's wrong? I saw Grandma in my dream! Oh, you're right, my boy. Come here. We can sleep together tonight, and your dad can sleep with your monkey. Hey, fuck off! Whoa, Necati! That's rude, that is no way to talk to a little boy. [kisses] Baby, you didn't hear that, right, sweetie? Get comfortable, okay, my boy. Handan, honey, he is a big boy, but I see you're gonna let him sleep with us, Handan, huh? None of your business. Mmm. Mm-hmm. [sighs] You are a good boy. My little boy. [kisses] My Mehmet. - [slaps] - [sighs] Fucking bastard. TAKSİM THEATER - [exasperated sigh] - Serkan, sir! Hello, how are you? Oh, no. What do you want now? Serkan, would you mind if I take five minutes of your time, please? Listen, I'll call the police this time. Serkan, please, I'm really begging you. Serkan! Hey, look, if you just spare me five minutes of your time, I will tell you everything, and I promise that you'll never see me ever again, I promise you. Five minutes. Five. I'll be brief. Just five minutes. I'll have a chai tea latte, and for Serkan, an espresso lungo, and one of those wonderful Belgian cookies of yours, please. Right. [sighs happily] What is your deal? Why are you following me, lady? Serkan. Serkan, seriously, don't you remember me at all? I'm Dilara. Dilara Başaran. Doesn't the name ring even the smallest of bells? Doesn't it mean anything to you? Dilara Başaran. I really have no idea. Though... honestly, you looked familiar to me that night. If we had a thing while I was high... Fuck you, Serkan. Um... Mr. Serkan, ahem, um... I... I'm in the middle of a difficult and weird thing. Um, but it won't last too long, I'm quite sure of that. Because I really trust my gift. I trust it so much that I'm positive that I'll get my old life back, even if I have to start from scratch. I know this. But all I need is to go back where I started, back on the stage. - You an actress? - Yes! Yes, yes, I'm an actress. And I'm just asking for a small favor of you. Just an itsy-bitsy, tiny help is all I need from you, that's all. I don't even know you. Why would I help you? Serkan, I know you. And you know me. In fact, I know you better than anyone else! I know better than anyone what makes you happy, what makes you sad, and what makes you cry even. I know that you avoided girls in middle school because you were kinda fat. Um, ha, in fact, I know you used to eat your lunch hiding in the boys' room. I know that while you were young, you wanted to play the mandolin, but your dad had smashed it and sent you to wrestling class instead. I know that your mother is an anti-depressant addict. I really know everything about you, Serkan. - You watched Katarsis, right? - Oh, screw this! Ugh. Screw this! - I think it's coming back to me. - [relieved sigh] I'm going home from here, Dilara. You wanna join me? What? What do you mean? Here I am, desperately asking for help, but you're inviting me home with you? [giggling] You will help me, right? You will, right, Serkan? [Serkan grunts] - Huh? - Yeah, yeah. [panting] You have that look in your eyes, it's like... When do I get to meet the guys at the theater I'll introduce you, but the rest is up to you. No more favors. The girl who's been playing Harika's sister will be on a TV show. If you're interested, there's an audition. It's make it or break it for you. You know the part? Mmm. It was Arzu's character. Arzu plays Harika. - For now. - [cell phone ringing] INCOMING CALL HUBBY NECATİ [kisses] Handan, what the hell is this? Broccoli soup, and here's the salmon. Look, I also made salad. And there is bread. I'm so close to losing it. I'm about to lose it too, Necati. I mean, what the hell? Do I have to cook for you every day of my life? No way in hell. You need to hire some help. Hire help? Handan, you've really gone off at the deep end. What help are you talking about? Are you trying to bankrupt me? "Hire help, Necati." "Pay for the cab, Necati." And salmon! What is going on? I mean, salmon? Stop yelling at Mommy! Hire help. Broccoli soup is my favorite! Don't eat it, but we will! [Necati] Really, jackass? When have you had broccoli soup? [Akif] Call me. Call me now, Handan! They're asking about the money. If I'm going down, I'm taking you with me. [Necati] I'll smack you, right now! Handan, for God's sake... [Akif] Handan! [Necati] Go make some rice or something, please. Please, go do it for me. This is ridiculous. It's no different than throwing away money. [Mehmetcan] Shut up, damn it! [Necati] Hey, I swear, I'll come there and dip your head in the broccoli soup, you hear me? [Mehmetcan] I'm hungry! I'm hungry, I'm hungry, I'm hungry! I'm hungry!

Handan's dead, gone, no more, forget about her. Hey, listen to me, if you ever call me again, I swear I'll tell Necati everything. - Understand? You hear me? - Stop it. I swear I'll tell Necati everything. Ah! Ow! Oh, fuck! Fuck! Ow. - [groans] - [Akif] Listen to me! God, please make it stop. Enough of this. God, please. Please, I'm begging you, God. God... [inhales in pain] [tense music playing] Are you thirsty? Come. [music fades] I owe you all an apology. Believe me, I'm very ashamed of what I did. But it was all because I was on meds. But I'm off of them now, because I'm fine. This woman harassed you, too? We had a small, unpleasant encounter. - And you dare bring her to us? - Miss Arzu. Believe me, I'm not the person you think I am. I sincerely apologize to all of you. And I'm truly a big fan of you guys. Levent, she says she's an actress. Hmm. Um, where did you say you performed professionally last? I... I was in a short movie. How short a movie? As short as a short movie can get, yeah. I mean, um, what's the movie about? An actress, um... who plays in a shampoo commercial suddenly finds herself inside the life of the commercial, and she starts to live in it. That was the plot. [chuckles] [Levent] Sounds fun. Yeah, fun, real fun. Actually, we need to cast a sister, Harika's sister, but to be quite honest, uh... I don't think you'd be able pull it off. Sir, I just want a chance for an audition. And I'll ask nothing more of you. Please? Uh... I think s he should have a chance for an audition, Levent. Go ahead, you should audition. We all need a good laugh. All right. Guys, turn the lights off, so she can seriously get into character. [chuckling] For years, I've been waking up hoping that I would hear from you, did you know that? Maybe you would end up dead in the gutter from some kind of overdose. I really want you to know that... [sighs] ...that even the thought of this is enough for me to wake up happy in the morning. [dramatic music playing] But then I feel ashamed of myself. I ask myself how could anyone wish death upon their sister? Hmm? But then you go and do something, Harika... and you make feel okay with being ashamed of you. As long as you're dead, as long as you're six feet under, I am okay with being ashamed of myself, that's how you make me feel. But that doesn't happen, Harika. Why doesn't it happen? Hmm? Why doesn't it happen, Harika? Why are you still alive, huh? Why are you still living in my world? Don't you feel ashamed of everything you've done and are? I thought your whole purpose in life was to embarrass me. Go ahead, embarrass me, then. Come on, Harika! Die and embarrass me! Harika, please do it. Die, just die and embarrass me! Come on, Harika. Just die and embarrass me! Embarrass me, Harika! Please, just, please do this, Harika. Die and embarrass me! Please, Harika, please. [sobs] Please... [continues sobbing] [clapping] [sighs] Marvelous. Hm! Dilara, the guys in production will call you with a rehearsal schedule. Mm-hm. Obviously, it's a little tentative. We have to work late sometimes. Working late? Yes. Well, all right, sir. Welcome aboard, again. [chuckles] [sighs happily] Serkan, I did it! Serkan. Come on, I'm late for the shoot. Hey, Arzu! I'm very excited to play with you all! [sighs] Welcome Well... welcome aboard.

Start serving. Take this, too. - [Feride] She can eat those. - [mother] Throw it away. Why isn't Akif here? He's on a business trip, Mom, that's why. That's how it always starts. With a business trip. What's that supposed to mean, Mother? You couldn't give the man a child, what do you expect him to do? He's looking for happiness in other places. That's enough, Mother. I've had it! Shut up! You've embarrassed all of us in front of that guy. - [mother] It's true. - Dad, tell them to stop. Can you make them stop? What? Here, Dad, here, never mind her. It's really delicious, nice and juicy. Have a taste. - Mmm. - [Ayşegül] Here it comes, catch!

Give me those. - [Feride] What are you doing? - Put it on Necati's tab. - I can't drink. - You can, and you will. Here. Go ahead. Sister-in-law, I have something to tell you, but this is strictly between us, and you can't tell a soul, got it? Because this is a secret. I got a role in a play. Come to the rehearsals with me. It's better to keep me company than staying at home crying your eyes out, because I don't think your brother will let me go out alone, so I need you to come. Okay? You'll be with me. Then what are we gonna tell him? Well, we'll tell him we're going to a cooking class or something like that. Don't worry about it. I'll handle him. Okay. [Necati] Handan? Are you drinking beer, honey? If only he knew what other things Handan does. [chuckles] Asshole. - Phew, are you tired? - [Mehmetcan] Mmm. Almost there. Almost there. She fell asleep from all that running around. Are you tired, Dad, huh? Now, Handan will make you some linden tea with some biscuits, or fruit on the side, and you'll be good as new. Won't you give a hand with these? [panting] [sighs] Fuck you guys. [footsteps approaching] [man] Don't yell or I'll kill you. Don't yell. - [whimpers] - Don't yell or I'll kill you. You hear me? - [muffled] Okay, okay. Okay. - Where's the money, Handan? Where's the money? Tell me, damn it. Where's the money, woman? Speak! What are you talking about? What's the matter? Look. Look what happened to me, look. Tell me where the money is? Where's the money? Listen, listen to me, they electrocuted me at the hospital, okay? My memory is spotty. I don't know what money you're talking about. Are you fucking kidding me, lady? Huh? The company's donation money in the brown leather bag. Where the hell is it? Why would I have your stupid brown leather bag? - What do you want? - Are you trying to drive me nuts? Where the hell is the money we've been skimming every month? Tell me where it is. Oh, you two idiots were laundering money, weren't you? - What the hell are you trying to pull off? - Shh. Are you trying to play the crazy card on me? Are you trying to play the crazy card? We were going to run away. And we even had a place to stay. Were you gonna run away with someone else, huh? Is that why you're not giving me the money? Too late, the company knows it all, baby. They know it all. [Necati] Handan, honey? Handan? What's wrong? Oh, my poor baby. Are you tired now? Oh, come on, Handan. Come on, Handan, come on, honey, for God's sake. The kids need to take showers. Hey, I'll kill myself. [groans] [laughs] Come on, come on. [suspenseful music playing] [woman from hospital] Depression. And acceptance. But you should not accept it.

I was sitting there thinking how I hated that cousin of mine. I turned my head around and there was... you. It was like a fire had started in me. So strange. I just couldn't help myself, baby. I was thinking... "Damn, this is no good, I have to talk to her." "I need to find an excuse." So I got up, I approached your table, I said, "I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm not okay with this." "Either we make more space or join our tables, because it's just not fair, at least for me." "I don't like people passing through us."
