Adios, give me 10 bucks for Louis here. $10? $10, what's wrong with that, $10? That's a lot of freaking money for three cups of coffee. What do you want from me? The guy is from Boston, you know? Hey, Louis, tell Tommy Cucci to hurry up. We got a job. Hey, and, Louis, tell him nice. We don't want to piss off the prince. You know what I'm saying? So Tommy's old man is away? -Yeah. -Where? He's in Marion. Jesus, how long? Two 20s, consecutive. So they wanted Mr. Tommy Cucci, Sr.? Yeah, they wanted him bad. The freaking guy does Jackie Brancato a favor, then Jackie has him set up. My people don't know Jackie. You're not related. Same last name is all, all my Brancatos were smart enough to settle in Boston. Your Brancatos? What's the story with Tommy, ain't got no juice now that the old man is away? I don't know what he's got. I know that we're sitting here waiting for him. He ain't sitting in here waiting for us. They make 'em? No, not yet. Well, are they going to? What am I, a freaking librarian? I'm just asking. Penucci said Lamb would give him a shot. Don't call him Lamb. Everybody in Boston calls him Lamb. Yeah, well, you ain't in Boston. Down here, we call him Mr. Joseph. Mr. Joseph? Sounds like a freaking hair dresser. The only hair dressing he's gonna do for you, Matty, is gonna put a new part in that freaking rug of yours. This ain't no rug. Yeah, right, and I ain't freaking handsome. This ain't no rug. It's a weave. It's a what? A weave, they got these girls in Thailand that grow their hair down to the ankles. They sell it to the hair club for men guy, and he attaches it to the head. So it's plugs? It's not plugs. It's a freaking weave. [MUSIC PLAYING] I've been reading the book you gave me. Which one? You know, the one about the painter. Monet? No, not that one, the-- the other guy, the one that painted all those women in doors. Vermer? Vermeer, that's one of the ones Jackie loaned me. They didn't know much about him. Who, Jackie? He works at the museum. Not him, the other guy, the painter, Vermeer-- all those paintings he did, nobody knows anything about him. Yeah, the guy is a mystery, all right. Yeah, you men like that. What's that? You know, being mysterious, right? Here he comes. What the heck's he doing? Come on. We ain't got all freaking day here. Hey, Jimmy the Pope, what in the heck's up? Tommy Cucci, Matty Horse Brancato from Boston. Hey, Boston, uh, Massachusetts, hey, I've been there. I had to lay off some money one time for some animals down in Southy. Yeah, remember his name? Nah, it was one of those schools, one of those fag schools. Are you talking about BU? BU, BO, what the heck's the difference? Boston sucks anyway, right? So, Tommy, I'm sorry to hear about your old man, you know? Oh, yeah, what are you sorry about? I mean, what's it got to do with you, huh? It ain't got nothing to do with me. Yeah, then why are you sorry? Tommy, he says he's sorry. It's a figure of speech, for Pete sakes. Oh, yeah? Well, so is freak you, Jimmy. That's a figure of speech, too. Hey, you can drop that. Hey, Tommy, you don't say that to a made guy, even if he is from Boston. That's right, you fool. I don't give a freak who you are. I didn't come down here to be freaking insulted. What did you come down here for then, huh, get yourself a better wig? Go screw yourself. I'll blow your mother-freaking head off. Will you look at this big mess, will ya? So what do we do now, Matty, huh? Now come on, Matty Horse. Me and you, we freaking break each others' bones, but we're all right, right, Matty? I don't give a freak. You hear me? I'll blow your mother-freaking head off. Matty, I gotta deliver this kid to Mr. Joseph in a couple hours. If that don't freaking happen, it's on my head. This kid has got to freaking apologize to me, or this gun don't freaking move. Now you let me take care of this, and you'll get the freaking apology you want. I promise you. Now put the freaking gun away. Put the freaking gun away. Put it away, Matty. I said, put it away. Get the hell out of my car, the both of youse. Sorry about that, Matty, his freaking old man, you know. Yeah, Jimmy, get out of the freaking car. Hey, Matty, your hair, it looks pretty good. I mean-- Jimmy, get your face out of my freaking car. Macaroni is good, the sauce, I mean. I was thinking, though, maybe, uh, maybe you could add a little more salt. I don't know. You need salt. I'll get you some salt. Yeah, maybe-- you know, no. On second thought, no, no need, it's fine. Wine is good, though. -What do you mean, though? -What? I'm sorry. You know, like, when you say, the wine is good, though, it's like you're saying something else isn't so good. Did I say that? Yeah, you said it. You said, the wine's good, though. And I'm wondering, though, what? Well, sometimes I like, um, you know, to have a little ice cube in mine. Ice cube in what? In my wine, where did you think I wanted it? I don't know. If you want some ice, I'll get you some ice. No, no, no, you're fine. You know, I just wanted a little taste, anyways. I don't want Father Scapali thinking I'm drinking, right? Hey, you never told me what you thought of him. I didn't? Remember when you took me over there the other week? You said, someday, I'm gonna tell you what I think of that guy, but you never did. What do I know about priests? I haven't been down to church since I made my first communion. But you were baptized. I guess. It's nothing I remember. Oh, no, you were. I'm sure. How are you sure? Well, because, you know, you-- you're a good person. I am? Yeah, I think you are. You are to me. You know, you help me with stuff and everything. So you're saying you've got to be baptized before you can be good? Yeah, pretty much, yeah. That don't make much sense. Why not? Well, take for instance Steinberg. Right, she used to come by every night to make sure you were OK. You thought she was a good person. Now you gotta figure she wasn't baptized. The way I figure it, Jewish people don't have to be baptized because Jesus was Jewish. John the Baptist was Jewish, so I figure, you know, they got baptized enough for the whole, you know, race. That's nuts, Marilyn. Well, maybe it's nuts to you. That's the way I see it. What about Mr. Hwang, the guy from the laundry store? Now he's always helping you carry your laundry upstairs and stuff. Oh, by the way, did you remember to pick up the laundry today? I picked it up. I put it away this afternoon. OK, so what about Mr. Hwang? He wasn't baptized, and he ain't Jewish. But he's a nice man. Mr. Hwang was not baptized, but he can still be a nice man. He just can't be saved. How can you say this stuff? You asked me, so I'm telling you. Mr. Hwang can come back next time as another person, see? That's why the Asians believe in reincarnation, because this is the best they got going this time around. Does that Father Scapali fill your head with all this nonsense? No, Father Scapali is too damn happy for his own good. He thinks everybody goes to heaven, no matter what. No matter what? No matter what. What about a guy who robs and steals and stuff? Goes to heaven, according to Father Scapali. What about a guy who does even worse stuff? Heaven, according to Father Scapali. -So do you think so, too? -Me? Of course not, I'm not crazy. That's just Father Scapali's crazy take on everything, and even he don't say it when the bishop is around. -Who is the bishop? -The bishop? He's Father Scapali's boss. Who's the bishop's boss? The cardinal. And what does he think? Oh, he thinks what the pope thinks. And what does the pope think? He thinks what God thinks. Yeah? Yeah, what? So what does God think? Frankly, Vincent, I think that is something you're gonna have to figure out for yourself. It's good macaroni. What time do you have to be at work? Father Scapali likes us at the shelter before midnight, but most women of the women are down before then. But he likes someone at the phones. I've got to meet this guy. Who? What guy? Father what's-his-name, the everybody goes to heaven guy. Yeah, well, he's there every night. You could meet him. He wants to meet you anyway. He said that? When? He said it. He said it when you came to pick me up that time. Remember? He said, I'd like to meet that guy. Hey, V. -How you doing, Tommy? -I'm all right. You know, what can I say? Yeah, what can you say? V, do you know this guy named Matty Brancato from Boston? They call him Matty the Horse. No, I mean, I heard his name is all. What's the matter? Is this guy a problem to you? Yeah, Brancato, that's the problem. Well, you say he's from Boston. There's a lot of people from Boston. Same name don't mean nothing. Yeah. Unless you're talking about you and your old man, of course. Now that last name means something. -Yeah. -How's he doing? Oh, you know, he's got his health and everything, but he can't stand being locked up. You know? I don't know what happened there. I mean, yeah, Jackie Brancato set him up, but-- But what, V? Tommy, nothing is easy. Nothing is what it really is. Do you know what I'm saying? Yeah, listen. I gotta go down to the club tonight to see Mr. Joseph. Yeah, I figured. When you get time for something, though, just remember what I told you. In this life we got here, nothing is what it seems to be. -Yeah, nothing's nothing, right? -What do you think? Are they gonna make you? Yeah, I guess so. Do you want that? Yeah, of course, I want that. Why wouldn't I want it? Because maybe it ain't all what it's supposed to be. Looks like it's done all right by you. Tommy, it's like this. Who is your best friend? I ain't got no best friend. All right, let's say-- let's say you did, all right? And let's say Mr. Joseph says, Tommy, I want you to go out there and kill your best friend. But I don't have a best friend. You've got no choice. I mean, if Mr. Joseph says, kill your best friend, and you're not made, you can say no. But if you're made, you got no choice. They'll make you do it just to make a point. What point is that? That they can. They own you, Tommy. You're theirs. Well, like I said, it ain't done you any harm, V. I'm only saying is all. Look, I've gotta get going, you know? Tommy, tell your old man, OK? What do you want me to tell him? I was thinking of him, OK? That's all. Take care, V. VINCENT (VOICEOVER): Tommy, Sr., used to say to me, think of it this way, Vincent. You're walking down the street and you turn to the right. And whatever's waiting for you there, that's your life, Vincent. And there's no sense worrying about what would have been or could have been if you'd taken the left because that's not to your life. That's just a lot of noise taking up room in your hand. And now Tommy, Sr., don't turn anyway no more. He's just sitting in a cell someplace. And because he's sitting there, my life has taken a turn I didn't want it to take. Nobody fools with me, this guys says, nobody. So I say to Jimmy, Jimmy, what about this? And he says, the guy comes from Boston, somewhere. His name was, um-- Freaking Manny the Horse, he wants to whack this kid. He wants to freaking break his head, and he don't give a damn, if that's what you mean. This guy is serious. I mean, he means it. I said, you know, he don't give $0.02 about his father, whether he's a wise guy, a made guy. He's gonna freaking teach this kid some respect. Can you believe this stuff? You know, Tommy, he's gonna freaking whack him. So I say to Jimmy, Jimmy, this is somebody who means business. And he says, don't worry about it. I've got everything under control. I said, he don't give a damn who his father is. He knows this guy is a made guy, and he's still gonna freaking whack him. Ready? Let me tell you, V. Let me tell you. I grew up in this, uh, neighborhood, right here. My old man, he was a bowling ball. My brother was a freaking animal. And me, I'm the skinny kid. And my mother says, where did we get you from? Petey, hold up a second. I gotta ask you. I mean, maybe you can help me with something here. Where did we get you from, as if she don't know, like I'm gonna be able to freaking tell her where did she get me from. Where the hell did she think she got me from? -Petey. -So I eat. I freaking eat, and I don't have no natural appetite, let me tell you. But I figure, hey, I'm not gonna be no pussy freaking willow, you know? And one day, I'm reading this comic, 'cause I love the freaking comics. And there's this one. It's called Metal Men, right? Petey, Petey, hey, I gotta talk to you. I'm reading this thing, and on the back, there's this Charles Atlas ad for turn yourself into one of these muscle guys. So I figure, hey, this is it. You know, I turn myself into one of these big freaks. No bully is ever gonna fool with me, right, because I am sick of getting my head kicked every time I go to school. Yeah, so, uh, I figured I'd send away for it. I end up with these muscles making back split out like a freaking cobra's head. Do you know what I'm saying? Petey, please, I want to talk to you. So I ask my brother, John. I ask him. I say, hey, John, loan me $3.95 so I can send away for this Charles Atlas stuff. My brother says, that Charles Atlas stuff is for fags, Petey. That's for big freaking uptown Johnny Marine type fags. And he starts slapping me around, and he throws me against the wall. And I fall, like, between the wall and where the bed is. This freaking gun drops out from under his mattress. So I pick up the gun, and I say, this ends here, just like that, because now I got the power to say what I want to say. My brother says, put down the gun, Petey. And I say, what gun? This gun here? I mean, just like that, acting cool and ice, you know? And I said, first thing, Johnny, you're gonna stop telling me what to do. I said, because I'm sick of you always telling me what to do. And he's beginning to back off a bit because he's never seen me like this. I mean, not in his own freaking room or anything. And I can feel it, V. I was standing there. I'm holding that thing, playing with Johnny's head. And I aimed the thing right for his freaking forehead, right between his eyes. So what did you do? Did you shoot him? -I don't know. The gun jammed, or it wasn't loaded, or something. It don't matter. How the hell don't it matter? It don't matter. I learned what I had to learn. I didn't have to shoot my freaking brother to learn anymore. All right, so you didn't shoot. He's my freaking brother, for crying out loud. Petey, Petey, I'm not sleeping these days. I mean, every night, like, I sleep an hour, two hours, then I'm up, walking the floor. It's like my stomach, you know? I love Cutty. You drink Cutty? Yeah, I like Cutty. Sometimes I drink Cutty. Sometimes I drink Dewar's. Most of the time I don't give a crap. I thought you drank rum. Yeah, when I was a kid, but not now. What about when you're working? What are you ask me, when I work? You know about when you work. You know about when I work. I don't drink when I work. I drink after I work. Yeah, well, I don't drink either. Most of the time, I don't drink. Sometimes I do, if it's easy, if it's a freaking cookbook sort of-- what the-- freak frig me. What are you freaking asking me, huh? What, because I popped some freaking guy, the wrong freaking guy, and I had to go pop his freaking wife and kids? Is that what you want to know about? Is that what you're asking me about, because I wrote the wrong freaking number down? Well, frig me. That's the freaking price of doing business in this town. Petey, do you believe in God? What the-- what are you, crazy? Asking me a question like that, what's the matter with you? Well, do you? OK, you want to know? You really want to know? Yeah, I want to know. Yeah, I believe in God. I figure you go all the way back there. I mean, you go all the way back to that big freaking bang there. I think God was sitting around, getting wasted with his angels. It was getting late, so he said, it's time to go home. Only he can't go home because wherever he is, he's already there, right? So he tells his angels to screw 'cause he's tired. So he gets pissed. And he takes this gun that he invents right there on the spot, and he goes, bang. There you go. You got your freaking universe. He goes to sleep. End of story. Know what I mean? You going? -I got a job I gotta do. Hey, V, do you know how Charles Atlas died? I don't know, old age? No, his liver gave out. No kidding? I don't know, V. Sometimes I just say, forget it. I mean, as long as I can shoot you, what's it matter, right? VINCENT (VOICEOVER): I wonder why they always put the morgue in the basement, as if they can't wait to set dead things underground, even before they bury them. Tommy, Sr., would have never sent me to the morgue. If I told him the job was done, the job was done, end of story, like two professionals, not this errand-boy bull. Mr. Cucci would say, yes, Vincent, that problem you wanted taken care of. And he'd say, thank you, Vincent, simple as that, quiet-like. [MAN TALKING ANGRILY] So why did I put that down, hmm? Why did I put that down then? Because that's what I am, damn it. Look, hey, what do you mean, who gave me that title? I gave me that title. Well, you know, Oxford gave me that title but-- Do you have any idea who the heck you're talking to, huh? Well, why did I put that down then? Why did I put that down then? Hey, what do you mean, who gave me that title? I gave me that title. That-- that's not the point. Look. [TALKING ANGRILY] Don't you know who I am? What are you gonna come back as? [STARTLED GASP] Now you gotta remember Zandy is a freaking whale. He's the original Moby Dick, this freaking guy. [ARGUING] Do you know how to freaking read? Shut up. Connie, no more playing around now. If I say we split the baby in two, we split the freaking baby in two, end of story. This is our thing now, and sometimes it takes a baby to make a mother scream. He means, make a mother's mother scream maybe. What was that? What are you guys saying over there? How you doing, Mr. Joseph? Go sit down, Tommy. Sometimes my consolior, he likes to argue history with me. Do you like history, Tommy? Yeah, well, I read some in school, you know, Germans, World War II, that kind of stuff. I'm talking about real history, Tommy, like Roman history, your history. I'm a little too young to have a history, Mr. Joseph. What do you mean, too young? There's your family's history, your father, his family. You know, Tommy, I've known every boss of every family in New York since Lucky Lou John. I even knew Capone, and I can say-- yeah, I can say he was a thug. He died in Florida of syphilis, right? He died of being a thug. And some of these new boys are no better because they forget what this thing, our thing, is all about. Well, what's it about, Mr. Joseph? Your father knew, Tommy. My father's not dead. Don't interrupt me. I said, your father knew. He knew about respect. He know about silence, and he knew about loyalty. Your father was a man, Tommy. He still is. And if scumbag Jackie Brancato dragged him into his big mess and set your father up, those Brancatos in New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Boston, all of them, no freaking good. I'm going to take care of this trouble you had with Matty Brancato. I know he's just a pick from Boston, but I got business with him now. So you let me take care of it. You already know about that, huh? I'm the boss of this family, Tommy of course, I know about that. Well, my father told me that-- Your father is in a cell in Marion, Tommy. Were you wondering whether an old man with oxygen can be the boss? My father still alive, Mr. Joseph. You know, Tommy, I was made three bosses ago by Don Vito hisself. And it's because I respect your father's memory-- because he is dead, Tommy. He's never gonna leave Marion. You know it. I know it. -You don't know that. Nobody knows that. But because I respect history more, I called you here tonight. Did you know the freaking FBI tried to bug this freaking apartment? You know, they try to bug everything else. And did you know they almost did it because some mother-freaking rat talked? What rat? I'm talking about V Dianni. V Dianni? Mr. Joseph, V Dianni is a stand-up guy. There's no way he's a rat. Is that right? Then maybe you ask your father in his cell in Marion if no way V Dianni is a rat. You go ask him while he sits there for the rest of his freaking life because of V Dianni the rat. Are you saying that V ratted out my old man? I'm saying this. I know a man, and he's a smart man, very smart, very clever, not a thug. In fact, he wants to learn about things like culture and art, so every Friday night he visits a museum and his Russian drunk dogs tell him about this useless crap. Well, tonight I want you to visit this museum. A guard named Kylie will let you in. Once inside, you're gonna find this man. And then what, Mr. Joseph? Well, the museum is a very old building, Tommy, and it's got a rat problem. I want you to get rid of the rat problem. Anything you say, Mr. Joseph. And about this Matty Brancato-- Hey, hey, you forget about this Matty Brancato thing because I got business with him. You forget about that, OK? And he looks like he's gonna have a heart attack. So I said, hey, Zandy, take it easy. Take it easy. Do you want to die on me? What are you gonna do? He says, hey, Sammy, how old is this girl? I says, what are you worried about? She's in good shape. She looks great, and she does all this exotic dancing, those things, eh, you know. And, you know, Zandy ways 280 pounds, 300 pounds. I mean, they gotta weigh him on the scale. That's it, Eddie, back and forth-like. You gotta get your breathing right. I breathe beautifully when I don't smoke my mind with this BS. I don't know about it. You've been smoking them cancer sticks. You gotta figure, you know, that with that cough and all, you got the big C or something, huh? What are you, a general surgeon? We're doing you a favor, there. Uh, we don't want to see you, you know, uh, fall over and, uh-- Yeah, well-- oh, look who we got here, Vincent Dianni himself. V, did you take care of that problem at Saint Alfonso's? What problem is that, Eddie? You know what freaking problem, V. Yeah, I just got back. I took care of it. Is that scumbag, Ianello still breathing? Hmm-mm. Cold? Stone cold. You're the best, V. You are the best. There's one other thing I need you to do for me, V. I was supposed to give it to Benno, but, uh, take a look at it. I think I pigeon kicked him in the head. Tommy Cucci, he pissed off this guy from Boston, some guy, Matty the Horse. He's some freaking idiot. But Mr. Joseph is doing business with him and wants him to go back to Boston happy because he's doing something else with him. Matty the Horse Brancato? You know him? No, I, uh, I just heard his name. That's all. Well, forget him. He's a big mook, OK? But Mr. Joseph, uh, wants to give him this money, OK? He wants to smooth his feathers, all right? You take care of that. You save Tommy a lot of embarrassment, and you save Mr. Joseph a pain in the neck. But I don't know this guy. Know this guy? He's a guy, like any other freaking guy. OK, but I told you, Mr. Joseph wants him to go back to Boston happy. Do you understand? He don't want no freaking problems with these Boston animals. So it's all in here? Take care of it, Mr. V. Take care of it. You're the best. You're the freaking best. If Mr. Joseph says you're the best, you're the best. Come on, Eddie. We figure you only did two minutes over here. Yeah, I know. You figured too much. Hey, Eddie, just where the hell am I supposed to find this guy? You freaking ingrate, you freaking, mother-freaking ingrate. What do I have to do, take you by the hand? If I tell you to do something, you freaking do it. You don't come back here and ask me stupid freaking questions and piss me off. Hey, Eddie, screw you. Screw me? Screw you, you mongoloid idiot. Who do you think you're talking to, you old retard? What do you think, I'm blowing smoke up your fat butt? Where are you going, you scumbag, you [ITALIAN]? I make the wind blow. [MUSIC PLAYING] VINCENT (VOICEOVER): They got everything now, all kinds of computers. Just push that first button, Mr. Jones, and you got your info in, your info out. Chunk in, chunk out, just like humans-- we are what we download. Hey. Oh, buddy-- VINCENT (VOICEOVER): So what do we got here? Some kid and his piece-of-trash girlfriend. I'm talking to you. Why don't you watch where you're going, man? You almost knocked me over. Take it easy. -Joe, come on. Let's go. Why don't you answer my question when I'm talking to you? What's your problem? Joey, what are you doing? Oh, look, he's deaf. Come on, honey. Let's go. -Deaf? He ain't blind, though. He can see. VINCENT (VOICEOVER): Deaf? Yeah, that's right, deaf as a post. I'll see him again, not tonight, but sometime. Breathe now, deep breaths, easy. It's hard to swallow, though. Once you're a pro, you can't let yourself take the bait, get into that amateur stuff. Like a box, the hands are registered. Cops on the scene, dying to find a bad guy, any bad guy. Seagulls, I remember when my father took me fishing with my uncle north of Boston. The old man wasn't used to the boat, the waves. He looked scared. Then again, the old man spent most of his life being scared, like he was always gonna tip something over, scared somebody would come along and tell him to go back to Naples. Most people think it's the fear of death. The real fear is the fear of not having enough. People will die for that. Ah, Mr. Dianni, a pleasure to see you again, it's been a long time. May I show you to your usual table? No, not now, Anthony, uh, I'm here on an errand. You don't mind if I look around? Oh, of course, it's always a pleasure. Thanks. VINCENT (VOICEOVER): Jesus, God, is this what we look like when we're feeding? Freaking Baggs, makes me the mailman 'cause Tommy Cucci pisses off Matty the freaking Horse. Here you go, Dianni. Track him down and give it to him, like they don't have steak in Boston. Now I gotta check every freaking steak house in Manhattan. Hey, V, V, my man, how you dong, V? Hey, there, Fast Eddie. What have you been doing with yourself? Geez, I was talking with Jimmy Pope. He said you've been feeling under the weather. No, not really, uh, a touch of the flu, maybe. All right, right, 'cause you look good, V, and we need you looking good. I mean, the ladies here need you looking good. Ain't that right? We don't want you girls dropping dead on us, huh? I think your friend is looking just fine, Eddie. Oh, you do, huh? How about you, Angie? Oh, yeah, I definitely do, too. I bet, sweetheart. Have you seen this, uh, guy Matty Horse? Matty who? Who's that, V? He's a guy from Boston. Yeah, maybe, I don't know. -Never mind, Eddie. -Come on in. Join us for dinner, huh? Not tonight, I gotta find this guy. All right, take it easy, V. Hello, Mr. Dianni. Glad to see you. How does it look for an hour or so? [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Vic, at least until the meetings is over. Have they been hitting the bottle? Certainly, Mr. Dianni. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] So how long do you think I have? I don't know, Mr. Dianni. Here, why you don't come with me? I will make some tea, and we can talk for a while. And then we will see about the gallery. I can hear the rain, the wind earlier, now the rain. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Russian proverb? No, I just made it up. You know, the last Russian allowed to paint in Moscow, Dropicha Vorkosmonov. So much for the art of the state, isn't it? What's the matter with you, Mr. Dianni? You look troubled. What can I say, Jackie? Is it your job? Americans invest too much in their jobs and just a little in their lives. Yeah, well, what did that guy say? This is the work we have chosen. I said it was a movie, or the man was a fool Please, come in. The last few stragglers have just left. Now if we give McBronner time to fall asleep and avoid Kylie-- You can hear that from here? In Russia, we grew up listening for every single footstep. I bet. You said, uh, your father did time in Siberia? He died in Siberia, so Stalin could feel safe at night when he was drunk. And what about your father, Mr. Dianni? What about him? Were you close to him? [COUGHING] Well? I don't really like to talk about my father. And why is that? OK, never mind, do you remember that painting by Jacques Louis David? "The Death of Socrates?" No, another one, one with Brutus where they are bringing bags of bodies of his sons. Yeah, I do. Sometimes, a society will praise a man who murders their children. Yet only a totalitarian state will praise the children who murders their parents. So you didn't answer me. Is it your job, or is it the woman, your lover? That's good, Jackie. My job or a woman, I like that. If only it were that simple. In this life, you navigate between the two. God forbid, we are unhappy with boss. And then our life fills space between them. How small is that space for you, Mr. Dianni? Sometimes, I think every place I've ever lived just seems like it's small. Look at this place. What are the dimensions, 8-foot cube? And still it's large enough. Well, you're a lucky man. Luck is bull. There are only two forces in the universe-- love and fear. And I thought it was love and hate. Most Americans made this mistake. You can blame your puritans for that. So what have I got to be afraid of? I didn't say you were, but fear is the force that make us small, tell us there will never be enough. And what does love do? Love, it's made a hovel like this large. McBronner is asleep. How long can I stay, you figure? I suggest half hour. Kylie walks this wing at midnight. Another man came here tonight. A friend of yours? No, this man was looking for you, Mr. Dianni. Kylie let him in. He was very nervous. I think he's still in the museum. What did he look like? He looked like you, Mr. Dianni, just younger. Like me? All faces tied by fear look alike, Mr. Dianni. This is a Russian poem. Never mind. This is a very safe place. I have to hear that poem. Jackie, why did you choose this painting? Because you wouldn't have. This is a painting for the space between. Between what? Between the old and the new, life, death, the serpent and the flood, fear and love, do you remember? This is the last painting made before the world decided to commit suicide, Mr. Dianni. Jackie, what did you mean, that part about the serpent and the flood? It's how the world survive all of the time, Mr. Dianni, making its way between two of them. Jesus, Jackie, where do you get this stuff? From this, Mr. Dianni. [MUSIC PLAYING] Come on, Jackie. Let's take care down here first. -OK. MAN'S VOICE: Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, get out, Tommy. Dad. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hello, Mr. V. It's nice to see you. I might have to hold you down. The girls are looking fabulous tonight. Mr. Cooz, how the hell did you get this job? An equal opportunity ball buster, now what will it be, the usual? No, water. You know, you had me going in that freaking car there. Yeah, well, you weren't going, Jimmy, 'cause I wasn't going. I swear to God, that freaking Tommy Cucci, he deserves a freaking-- Whoa, hey, settle down. What's done is done. Mr. Jo told Eddie Baggs to take care of [INAUDIBLE]. Ain't V caught up with you yet? V, what the hell is the V? Can't the guy afford a whole freaking name? He's got some money for you, Matty. Money don't take care of everything. How long have the boys been here? Mr. Pope? Just long enough for a round from the bar. Who's the other guy? Oh, that guy's from Boston. What's he talking about? Tommy. Tommy, he's a little strange, that one. Hey, his old man, you know, it ain't easy. I don't know. I always thought he was this big feeling fag. Hey, nobody talks to me the way he did. He thinks that you know how Jackie Shoes turned on his old man. Jackie Shoes Brancato, Matty Horse Brancato, same last freaking name. Hey, you piece of garbage. Hey, hey, take it easy, hey, hey. Hey, man. Matty, Matty, it was an accident. Hey, take it easy. Come on. You having a bad day? Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm sorry, man. Take it easy. Have some fun with this freaking kid. Take it easy. I think I gotta ask him. Hold on. Wait. Please, just settle down. Something tells me this is the best place for you at the moment. Take this $100. Keep it. What? And go put it in one of those pretty lady's garters over there. -Get out of here. You're kidding me. I'm not kidding you. Hey, hey, hey, hey, are you out of your freaking mind? [PUNCHING] Well, it appears this place remains an unsafe passage for you. Yeah, no kidding, Mr. Cooz. Would you, uh, accept an invitation to a safe place, you know, a place designed for things like this? Show me the way. -Give it to him. -Come on, jerk. Let's get out of here. Where the hell are we going? Hey, Cooz, where the hell are we? Cooz? Don't you have a flashlight or something? I almost put my eye out down here. Where the freak is this place? VINCENT (VOICEOVER): What am I doing here? Have I been here before? It don't look familiar. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] I hate you. Do you hear me? I hate you! Get off me. I hate him. [GUNSHOT] [MAN SCREAMING] VINCENT (VOICEOVER): Easy now, easy, breathe slowly. Stay relaxed. There's no problem, easy. It's just your imagination. Breathe easy. What took you so long? Just show me the way out of here. You ain't done yet. I said, show me the way out of here, or I'll blow your freaking brains out. No, you won't. You're done with that life. What are you saying? I'm saying, a couple of memories should have been enough for you. Just tell me how to get out of here, all right? We don't want no trouble here. That way. That better be right. It's right. This time, you can go. Next time, you stay. What do you mean, next-- Brooklyn, Brooklyn's a freaking paradise, my friend. It's the other side of the river, it is. Yeah, my father settled there right off the boat down on Fulton Street. Of course, he had papers, you understand. He paid some guy a big load of money. The old man spent his first day there, yo know, looking for work down on the docks because this guy he knew was supposed to get him a good-paying job. The only trouble was there were a thousand other guys just like him, and so he paid all that money for nothing. And then he had nothing. We had nothing. So the old man gets himself liquored up, drops me off with the nuns at Staten Island. Oh, God forgive me, but those nuns, oh, they were something else-- every freaking day with their prayers for the dead. You say they made you pray for the dead, huh? Every day, twice on Sunday. What's the point? A person dies. He either goes to heaven or to hell. So then if a guy dies and finds himself in heaven, you gotta figure he don't need any prayers for the dead. And if a rat bastard dies and winds up in hell, then those prayers ain't gonna do him much good either. The good souls in heaven don't need them, and the lost souls in hell can't use them. So who in Christ's name are they praying for? Just go up. Go ahead. She'll give you something. Go ahead. How you doing, guy? What did you bring tonight? Lots of stuff. -Are you all right? -Yes. Good, good, you take care, all right. All right? OK, hi, sweetheart. What you doing? Oh, I'm so glad you came back. Take care, all right. Oh, Barney, are you gonna wheel me? How long you been standing there? A while. You're not from the cardinal's office, are you? No, sir. That's good 'cause if they ever found out that I was letting these poor folk in the church, they'd take my parish away. It's funny, huh? Milton Berle was funny. You tell me, what's so funny about this? I meant, you know-- What? Churches were supposed to be built for people instead of the other way around. Is that what you're trying to say? Yeah, I think it is. God bless you then. You're closer to heaven than most of the cardinals in Rome. I don't think so, Father. Oh, you don't, do you? I'm afraid I-- Don't be afraid. You ever read the good book? You'll see the first thing that God says is, don't be afraid. No kidding? Nice, huh, not to be afraid? I don't know what to feel anymore. We all lose our way. It's because somebody somewhere must have hurt you badly. No, no, nobody ever hurt me. It's the other way around, Father. The tragedy is that we always try to help people, and we end up hurting them. It must remind us that we're all human. Those people inside, did you ever wonder how many of them volunteered to be homeless? Well, can't they work or something? Yeah, they could work in the physical sense, but what you're missing is that everything flows from here. And then it makes sense here. But once this is wounded, life gets confusing. So that's why you do what you do, huh, like healing people? I can't heal a thing. All I try to do is treat those people with a little bit of dignity so that maybe some day they'll let the God within them heal themselves. What do you mean, the God within them? Well, that might be a good thing for both of us to think about. Marilyn told me you're the guy who believes everybody goes to heaven. She's always scolding me about that one. She's a fierce judge. She is, nah, not really. So is that what you believe? About going to heaven? Absolutely, every last one of us. But what about-- What about what-- Liars, thieves, child molesters, murderers? -Yeah, what about all of them? Make room then because someday you're gonna be breaking bread with all of them when we're all healed. But how-- I mean, what about, you know-- The last judgment and all that? Yeah, yeah, what about going to hell and all of that? Well, frankly, don't tell anybody I told you this. But it's all a lot of malarkey. I mean, think about it. What does God gain, giving us the freedom to screw up if only to damn us when we do? I mean, what kind of God would that be, setting traps for us like he's playing a video game? Yeah, but murder? Life isn't a test. It isn't a game. It isn't a school. The fact is it's more like what everybody says it isn't. What's that? Life's a dress rehearsal, so don't worry so much. There's only one target, and he's too big to miss. Are you saying I can't miss him? No, you can't. Nobody can. You're saying, no matter what I've done? We're a lot tougher on ourselves than God ever thought of Peter. I can't-- I can't believe that. Vincent, would you take a walk with me? Vincent, I know who you are, and I can only guess what you might have done. I also know that you're troubled tonight, feeling guilty, depressed, looking for help, and not finding it. But it doesn't end here, Vincent. You can't help being what you are here, inside, where God is, forever, no matter what. Are you sure you don't want to see Marilyn? No, I've got a thing to do, Father. She loves you, Vincent. Come back again and see me sometime. I can learn a lot from you. From me? MAN: Hey, Tommy, what's she telling you there, huh? What, do you need a wife? Hey, Tommy, don't listen to them. They're pigs, swine, animals, like most men. Here. -What is it? -Well-- Hey, Tommy, did your old man go away because he was embarrassed by your taste in girls, or what, huh? He goes away. He can't take it. Hey, Tommy, concentrate on the cards with me. I'll take care of them later. Look. Come here. What does it mean? Very soon, you're gonna have to make a choice. Choice, what do you mean? -Hey, up yours, I paid $10. -Come on. Tell me what you mean. Your father. Hey, hey, hey, Tommy, hey, Jimmy the Pope tells me that your old man goes away. He went away 'cause he knows you don't want to do this life. You ain't got the guts for this freaking life. [LAUGHTER] Your father has gone away, so now they tell lies about him. Don't listen. You put wax in your ears. You can't go into the darkness because if you do, you're not gonna come out. And that is your choice. -Hey, there's V over there. -That's V? Where's V? That's V? Yeah. Hey, V, you freaking loser, where's my freaking money, you freaking loser? And you, you freaking faggot, your mother's up at home sucking eggs. Hey, fool-- [GUNSHOT] Get your hands off of me. Come on. Stay away from me, you red bastards. Stay away. -Where did he hit you? It's nothing. It's all right. I'll shoot all you freaking New Yorkers. Torro, go get Eddie Baggs. I don't know I'm gonna do with this. Come on. Come and get me. Come and get me. You're gonna want to get this stitched up. Vincent, it's all right. Come on. Come on. You come and get me. Come on. Put it away, while you still got a chance of leaving New York. I'll freaking blow you away. Calm down. Step back. Step the freak back. -Come and get me, yeah? You got a cigarette on you? What do you want a cigarette for? Right now, you gotta breathe nothing but air. What, are you, like, my old man now? [ARGUING] Easy, Tommy, I'm just trying to make sure you're OK here. Come on. Come on. You want a freaking piece of me? Hey, hey, you big loser. Keep your hand on that. Keep the pressure on. I'll be back in a minute. You big shot, look at you. Who the hell are you? Just put the freaking thing away, Horse. All I want to do is give you this money from Lamb so I can get the hell out of here. You got my freaking money? Of course, I've got your freaking money. I mean, Jesus, if you had waited a minute, I would have brought it over. But you went nu-- I don't know, V. Mr. Joseph said we were to take care of this guy tonight. That's what I did. Well, what he's saying, V, is that, uh, nothing was supposed to happen to Matty the Horse while he's in town. Him and Mr. Joseph have got some things going on, you know? Jimmy, you little freaking weasel, who's that over there? Come on. What are you talking about? Over there, Tommy Cucci, do you remember that name? Yeah, I remember that name. Open your freaking eyes, V. It's time to move on, all right? His old man is as good as dead. 20 years in that stinking cell, 20 freaking years, how many of us guys are still gonna be on this corner 20 freaking years from now? Shame on you, Jimmy. You betray his old man. You betray him. You betray me. Freak you! Hey, now, V, don't go spitting at Jimmy there. Well, what is it, huh? Nothing matters no more? Sucker, you screw your brother, huh? You screw your mother, huh? You screw me. Screw me. Screw you. Screw all of you, lying bads, all of you. No, Benno, no, no. Take care of this later. Come on, Tommy. Come on. Get up. Taxi. You couldn't bring him to an emergency room? I told you. You know what this is. Oh, I know what this is. -What it's about, you know. -Mm-hmm. Look, I'm gonna pay you for this. If you do this, you don't have to drive a cab for a couple of weeks. Maybe two weeks' wages would be a proper wage if this were a question of money. What about friendship? But friendship is a far more complex matter. Let's keep it a question of money, huh? Here, drink as much of this as you can hold down. In my country, they took anyone who had skills with their hands and taught us how to stitch wounds. My friend was a butcher. So one winter, they made him a surgeon. He did amputations. By the end of one year, it had driven him mad. You see, we had no anesthesia. The screaming, the misery, it was too much for him. One night, he left the camp to smoke a cigarette. A storm came up, and he disappeared. Later that spring, we found him. I was more fortunate. I had a mind for numbers and languages. My hands were never that good. Jesus, don't tell him that. Aw, this is nothing. I can use this flap of skin here to close it. In the '60s, when I moved to New York, there was a woman, Madam Kattia Bulgratsky. She helped young women who got pregnant. For a price, she would take care of their problem. In the '60s, huh? On Fourth Street, I had just arrived and lived downstairs with two others. We were crowded into one room. But Madam Kattia, she asked me if I would like to help her. She said she would pay me, and I was hungry. A young girl came to see Madam Kattia one night. She was Irish, auburn hair, fair skin, delicate features. This girl was very beautiful. So I stood there, staring at her, while Madam Kattia asked her to lie down on the table. Then Madam raised her skirt up over her knees and up her thighs. I had never seen such softness. Then the girl-- she couldn't have been more than 17-- she started to cry. I know I'll burn in hell for this, she said. Then madam took her kerchief and passed it over a small vial of ether and put her to sleep. I watched as the sadness drained from her face, and I wondered what God could punish such an infinitely suffering creature. And then madam began the procedure, all the time trying to teach me what she was doing. And as long as I didn't look at the girl's face or the stains where her tears had dried, I could separate what was being done to her from her, as if it wasn't being done to her at all. Later that night, I sat at a small table in my room and tried to drink myself senseless. That's when life became a thing for me, something over which no man has jurisdiction, since no man can replace it once it's gone. And so I cried for the girl, for the child that she had carried, and like in my country, for all the children who starve to death, and all the soldiers who froze to death, for all of them, maybe even for you. You got a place to stay, to sleep? Yeah, I got a place. Nobody knows where it is. Nobody knows where it is? I miss my father. Yeah, you'd better go there. You think? Yeah, you need some sleep. You'll feel better tomorrow. Well, what about you? I got a place to stay, too. Hey, V, where are you gonna be? I mean, in case I need to talk to you. I'll call you, Tommy. We'll talk. Tomorrow? Yeah, Tommy, tomorrow. Take care of him for me, all right? Hey, V, listen. I really appreciate what you've done. I mean, other than my old man, I ain't never had a real friend before. [MUSIC PLAYING] VINCENT (VOICEOVER): Looking back, I could make a fair list of things I've never done. I never went to a school dance. I never bought a house. I never learned to drive. I never fell in love. Maybe if I'd gone to that school dance, all the other stuff would have fallen into place. How do things end up the way they do? The point is, they don't just end up. They start someplace, like maybe when you're a kid and somebody dies too soon, or somebody goes away forever. Tommy's father, the time we had from the beginning, hanging around the neighborhood, telling me how good looking I was. Hollywood, he called me. Jimmy the Pope wasn't even a thought then. Eddie Baggs with his cigarettes, trying to get me to smoke, but I wouldn't do it. Baggs, every day I gotta make sure I stay alive, so why do I want to kill myself with that stuff? But it's different when you're a kid. You think you're immortal, so you swagger, big swagger, like to convince yourself you're not afraid, afraid the sky is gonna fall, afraid the bottom is gonna drop out. The old man in his 40s comes down with that lung virus, coughed so hard he'd pass out, coughing up blood, coughing up his heart. [COUGHING] My mother sent me to a junior office, so I go, scared. And trying not to be scared, I knock, and I go in. That bastard dullard sitting there, he must have weighed 300 pounds. He says-- after I tell him three times-- he says, so what's your old man's name, kid? Vincent Parmagano Dianni. VINCENT (VOICEOVER): I say, adding the middle name, thinking-- I don't know. Maybe it's gonna help or something. Dianni, huh? I don't know nobody named, uh, Dianni. You say your old man is A Mason? Yes, sir, he carved some of the saints on the cathedral in the Bronx. Hmm. VINCENT (VOICEOVER): But he was enjoying this, playing with me. Well, I'm looking at the role here, kid, and I gotta tell you. I don't see any Parmagano Dianni here. And I say, so what does that mean? What it means is maybe you should check to see what your old man does all day, 'cause I don't have his Italian name on my roster here. He works all day. He comes home with dust all over him. Kid, when you're fooling around where you don't belong, what do you think it takes to blow a pound of dust all over yourself? Gee. VINCENT (VOICEOVER): I started to leave his office. My face burned. He called me back, telling me to wait a minute. He said, now I'm not saying we couldn't make room in the rolls for one more Italian stone guy. That is, of course, if you've got the cash ready to pay the dues, that is. And this is what everybody was afraid of, afraid of some bastard who'd come along and snap your lifeline just like that, just like killing a bug, all because people with names like Vincent Parmagano Dianni didn't get here first. I went home, and on the way home I passed the boys on the corner, sitting outside Samia's. They all had radios to their ears, listening to the ball game. Tommy's father came over to me and said, if your dad needs any help with this thing, let me know. That night, I go home, and the old man is worse. My mother is losing it. Somebody help us, please! Don't let him die. Somebody help us. VINCENT (VOICEOVER): Nobody listened to her anymore because everybody in the neighborhood knew she'd gone a little crazy. [SOBBING] So I'd run to my father's room, and I'd sit by his bed, holding this bowl ot catch his life as it came out of him, like it had to break away from what was left of him. And his eyes swam across his vision, looking but not seeing, until he coughed. Then the dust he'd inhaled for 25 years called him away, with a sound like a cry to be forgiven for having died so pathetic-like. Then he coughed once again, this time, the last time, without a sound, and fell back. I took his hand and fingers, thick in heart. I laid them across his chest and brushed back the strands of hair lying across his forehead. After the funeral, after the seagulls, which had come from nowhere and had flown over the brown casket, over my mother's crying, over the headstone and the tombs, over the saints my father covered in marble, I returned to Sabia's and bought the gun from Charlie. Well, if it ain't the little Italian boy, come back to beg for his old man's job. I've come to beg for my father's life, Mr. Dolon. His life, what the heck have I got to do with his life? His life is his life. So forget him, and forget you. Now you got the money we talked about? Yes, sir, I do. VINCENT (VOICEOVER): I took the bills from my pocket. He looked at the money. It's not enough, he said. Bring me some more tomorrow. I'll see what I can do. I said, but you're not gonna be here tomorrow, Mr. Dolon. And he shouted, forget you, kid. Forget you and all your mob friends. I'm gonna be here as long as I want to be here. And I stood there, and I said, what's my father's name, Mr. Dolon? What's my father's name? VINCENT (VOICEOVER): But he couldn't answer because I was aiming a gun at his forehead. And that was the sound of silence he made. And I swear to God, for the life of me, it was like the sound of somebody coughing. MARILYN: Oh, Vincent, you were better than all of 'em. You showed me so much kindness. I remember that night when the music was playing and the lights were on. There was that storm off the Hudson. When I think about that, I just offer thanks for you and for life, and I want to hold you. I was so young that night. And then afterwards, we reached out our hands, and our shadows spread across the ceiling. But they never touched. Are you still too frightened to sleep? Maybe you're not too frightened anymore, huh? I said, Mother, do not disturb the sailor sleeping in the rented room. You'd never been a sailor. But I guess I said it more like a description maybe 'cause you just always seemed like a guy from a far-off place. But that night, you took me in your arms, and you broke my soul with your touch. And I said, Mother, do not disturb the sailor sleeping in the rented room because he is tired. And now it's over, Vincent. It's over until forever or tonight, when you come back to me in spirit. Only then will I eat again in silence, tearing fish without a sound. [MUSIC PLAYING]
