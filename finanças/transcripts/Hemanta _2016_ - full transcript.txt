We are indebted to the stars as well as the technicians. - You Are a Bengali? - Yup. Why don't you make Bengali films? Film is a universal medium. It is our great pride that our film Dhongsho … … Has fought 3 big budget Bollywood films … … And is still at number 1 in Bengal. Look, its commercial film and good commercial film … Makes the industry healthy. But we should be careful of dubious producers … … Money laundering … The man who literally pulled up Agradoot pictures from … … Bankruptsy and has given it so much success, One and only Kalyan Sen … … And the biggest star of Bengal, Gayatri Sen … … Have tied the knot. Gayatri is not only a star … … But one of the trustees Of Agradoot pictures. After her husband, the owner of Agradoot … … Ananta Sen's death … … She retired from films. To her it was probably justified … … But it was a big loss to the industry. The good news is, after the marriage last night … … She announced that she will be acting again.

This empire, Agradoot is finally yours Hemanta. I'm just a trustee. You are grumpy since the time you came. Your mother is getting hurt. It's not her fault! Whose … fault? - Nobody's - Right After your dad's suicide your mother … … Was completely shattered. She withdrew from everything. - She never wanted to disturb you - Yea.

And the truth is … … Copying South Indian films to make money? This film Dhongsho … … What was the original title? Interesting … … I keep forgetting it. What was it? Rotting! So there is something rotten in the state of things. If you literally mean the State of Bengal then I'd say … You haven't been to Bronx or Harlem. Stayed only in the tony places of New York.
