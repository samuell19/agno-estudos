Dear brother... I bought your paper one morning... "Arena"...And started reading from the beginning. Then, on one page, a hammer over my head. Straight into the forehead. Your picture and headline: "School Murderer". I checked your picture, your first and last name. My feet were sweating. Soaked. I splashed myself with cold water and said: "It's over" with my homeland, brother and memory of mother Vranka" MATERNAL HALF BROTHERS I went hunting with my patron and his dog. I am only thinking about you and wondering... Should I abandon Veselin now? How much are the two of us brothers? I am forty, and you are not even twenty yet. We have never met. You murdered a boy of your age. He insulted you, oppressed you. You had to respond as our blood requests. I won't be looking for a lawyer for you nor evoke suspicion. You will be alone before the judge, without parents, with a half brother in someone else's world doing not such an honorable job, who likes to call himself a Croat or some other ustash name. Change your clothes. Get out. Your hands. Where are you going? - Hotel Yugoslavia for investigation. So you are Veselin Cvijetkovic? What did you so young? I am your attorney provided by the court of law. Bring him here. Don't hide anything. Tell us exactly what happened. You will help yourself and me. Come on. Talk, were you here and why? We were at our prom night. I escorted Danka, my friend, to the toilet. Bring the girl. Stand there. Then what? Where did you sit and how did you escort her? Show us. Hey, save me. I feel like crying, but I can't. Move! You mother fucker! - Why did you trip her? Go, man, go and take a piss! You idiot! Were you looking at yourself in the mirror? - Touching my tie. Go ahead, touch it. - I don't have a tie. Want me to give you mine? Touch your neck! Let's hear the two of you. Look at the faggot in the ladies room. - I can't hear you! Look at the faggot in the ladies room. And? - I said, he's not a faggot, he's dumb, he can't read. What happened then? Then Adzic said, let's beat him. What did you see? - Veselin was covered with blood and crying. I wasn't crying. - Yes, you were, Veselin. You were crying. Crying or not, it doesn't matter. What next? I felt sorry for him. While I was wiping off the blood, he said that if he had a knife, he would kill. - What did you say? I said, if I had a knife I'd kill. - Those were your words? Yes. What did you do? - Then I went to the restaurant, because I know stupid Nidza... - We're going to the restaurant. You stay with him. In fact, I went to the kitchen. - OK, we're going to the kitchen! Passing through the kitchen, I saw the knife here. I don't know how, but I took it. Did you take that knife? - I did. Take it, what are you waiting for? OK, what now? Come on! Come on! Look at the kid, he's back! You idiot... Kids... Who has you and who makes you, fuck him. How's it going? There is a dictaphone, a tape recorder from Austria. You know, you can't keep this thing here. It's not allowed. I'll try to provide a special permission. You don't have any family, no one visits you... Maybe that fact could help, you know... This... This Braco Gavran who sent you this... Who is he? My brother. - You never said you had a brother. He's my half brother, from my mother's side. Strange last name... Gavran. He's a Croat? His father was a Croat, mine was a Serb. In our homeland beneath the mountain Dinara, Serbian and Croatian villages are one by another. Why doesn't he visit you sometimes? Emigrant? Political? Ustasha? - I don't know. I've never met him. While I'm sitting here among someone else's dogs, and I'm not good at writing; you can at least hear my voice, and I myself will find strength in speech and truth. I will speak in great detail. Time is wasted anyway, but it will help the soul. I will tell you about me, our mother, my father Antisa, your father Krstan. The truth must be saved, so at least the two of us can remember it. Our mother Vranka didn't know her exact date of birth. During the pernicious plague and Spanish fever, her mother, father and grandfather died, so she became an orphan. In '36, she left her parents' house and went down the road to the gendarmerie station. Every penny she earned, she kept in her little chest. Vranka, tomorrow is Mother of God's holiday. It's time to show yourself before the people. Do you have a gendar? - How would I have it? Here. This is my little daughter's, but keep good care of it. Easy for you to show off when Serbian gendarmerie pays you. Gendarmerie whore! We'll cut your hair and make you a sheep. Good afternoon! I am a day laborer. I will do any kind of work. Dig vineyards, wash wool, reap. Come in! Did the Simic family drive you away? They drove me away, Antisa. Where are you heading now? - I am going to Knin. I heard a railroad is being built across Bosnia. There'll be bread for me. - I was there and came back hungrier. There are a lot of workers. No money there. Don't go. Stay with me. - Do you need a day laborer? I'm not leaving you as a... Day laborer, but as a wife. Marry me. Will your mother and father come to ask for my hand? No, they won't. They are under the ground, like yours. May you be better than your father! On April 13th, 1937. Their son Braco was born. That is, me. Till the beginning of the war we lived peacefully and happily. As people would say, there was music, we ate good food, drank good wine and slept in soft wool. Whether you like it or not, I have to tell you about the war. I was only four, I don't remember it that well. Vranka's memory became my memory. So, don't take everything for granted. Dear townsmen... Today we are recruiting ustashas here. Who wishes to be a soldier of the resurrected Croatia, please stand in the line behind the truck. Let's go. Name, name, name... Please, no pushing. Hold this. Watch out. The Orthodox people are cutting our forests and feeding cattle on our meadows. As we would say it, they have always plotted against us. Put one Serb to sit at the table, give him wine to drink, put the other one under the table, tie him up in a sack, kick him... Both of them think the same about you. It cannot be good and spacious for both them and us under the mountain Dinara. Orthodox schismatics must bow to us and then be removed. Those who came last must leave. What did you bring? - Some vegetables. Any olive oil? - There is some. Here's some polenta and some goat milk. - Quiet! Be quiet, I want to hear him. Leave him alone, he's got enough trouble of his own. They won't leave us. - Reverend, I suggest that we call them to a gathering in Smrekovo, and explain them how they should obey the new authorities. Will they come? - They will! Even if we have to force them. Go on, take that child and don't bring him here again. Go on. The policemen went to Kulija. - Go, run off, I tell you. Take the child! - I'm going. All clear! Simic! Move! Simic! Get up! What? They're here! Jesus, so many of them! Come here, people. Come here. Nothing to fear of! Come here! Come on, people. Don't be afraid. Come on. Sit down. Let's have a talk. There... Now, one by one, give me your hands... Back, back... There... Don't be afraid... Come on. Next! Faster! Godfather Josa! Godfather! Godfather Josa! Godfather! Water! Water! Everything is going as planned. Stay here, darling, I'll be right back. No, darling, stay here. He said you shouldn't go up there. Is that Golubnjaca? - Get away from there! I brought you... - I won't eat! Get away! I always said they should go to Serbia. Poor people. Just like me. Don't think they didn't pay us back. In the schismatic villages around Smrekovo, the young and old started out and attacked us. Stay here, darling. We were attacked by the chetnicks twice, but we held well until February 1942, when a large partisan unit came by. Take care of the child! Darling, get up. We're going to the mountain to find our Antisa. No one has ever escaped fate. Come on! Can you manage, darling? - Yes, I can! Go on, darling, sit there. A little further. Oh, Antisa, my curly hair... How you went into the mountain... How I found you in the mountain... Villains spread your bones... If I could collect them all... And bring my great man together again... Come on, darling. Let's go home. Does anyone know where Antisa's grave is? Is there any mark on it? I doubt it. If I told you the whole story, you wouldn't know our sorrows even if you spent all your life in jail. I have to skip some things. The war came to an end, and then came what you call freedom. In the summer of 1947, Vranka is working as a day laborer again. Young one, come here! Let's see how fast you are. It's easy to screw with the poor. Darling... Your mother promised you to the mother of God, our Madonna of Sinj. We're going to her barefoot, as it should be. Will you be OK? - It won't be the first time to walk barefoot. My darling... I made an oath that we are not going to eat anything until we reach the Madonna of Sinj. Here, have some water. Praised the Lord! - Praised the Lord! You are coming from afar? - From Slavonia. We have been traveling seven days. - Barefoot all the time? So the Madonna would have mercy on us. You will see. The Madonna of Sinj will help us. There is no such trouble or illness... That the Madonna doesn't have a cure for. Holly mother of God, help us. Gracious mother... Pure virgin, have mercy. What are you doing here? It's your turn to give a sheep or a lamb. We sent people twice for nothing. I only have a goat. Well, give us the goat. It's feeding my child. Go away and don't come here again! I'll tell Zvonimir. Tell him I might say where he is hiding. Praised the Lord. I came during the day to show you how much I'm afraid and to tell you, the widow of a brave ustasha, that Zvonimir Simic still rules in Smrekovo. If you don't do as I tell you, take your things and go... But, I won't give you Braco. We'll raise him to be an honorable ustasha. There's your Madonna of Sinj. Hush, darling. Go get dressed. Stay here, darling. I'll be right back. What is it? - Simic! Shall I go too? - You stay here! What's your little one's name? Braco. Braco? Is that so? Braco, come here. Come here! Go on, darling! Respect the authorities. Don't be afraid. Antisa's little boy? Son of an ustasha. Tough head you got there... I'll soften it. Why is this guy hitting me!? Your father was the proudest ustasha in Smrekovo. He was on the tower. Remember? A little. Who killed him? Was it them? Don't ask. It's true we killed him, but she deserves the praises. So many good and honest people died in the war, no one shed a tear and you're crying because of this villain. Don't... What will happen to me and this orphan now? Well, I'm an orphan too. I live alone. Come with me until we find something better. They set our house in Smrekovo on fire, for revenge. We stayed in your house, me in your bed. No one had such a good tree. Let it be, let it be, where my ass is, there your nose is. I have a new job. I'll be guarding the forest! I'll be a forest ranger! What about us? This boy and me, homeless. If you don't mind... Let's get married! Who? - You and me. What about Braco? What about him? He'll be like a son to me. Why would he be in the way? Then be it. The Orthodox people are celebrating Saint Nicholas. Let them celebrate and be merry, we won't! It's nice to see people hosting their families. The Committee says that such things should be stopped! Who is that now? Merry Slava, Krstan! I heard my Krstan got married, so I thought I'd drop by, come to the Slava... This is the bride? This is her little puppy? Here, an apple for the puppy... And for you, some sugar. - Thank you. What? You don't look so good. - No, aunt, no. We are fine. What now? - And where... Where is the candle? Where is the icon of Saint Nicholas? - It's lost, aunt! God forbid, how could you loose it? - The war, aunt, the war. Here's a candle. - Give me a dish with some grain in it. I see this antichrist of mine hasn't taught you anything. Like this. You're ours now. There is no difference. We're all the same before God. Like this, come on. No! Not with an open hand like a shovel. Like this... Three fingers. Put your fingers together... Three... Like that... There... And now... In the name of the Father... The Son... And the Holly Ghost... Amen! Once again. In the name of the Father, the Son... And the Holly Ghost, amen! Merry Slava! And the host? I understand. Will you at least buy a calendar? I know nothing. I'm a communist and don't come to this house ever again! So be it, but remember. It's not good for anyone to close the door to a priest on the day of his Slava. Oh, my home, you never expected this! He's not receiving a priest nor lighting a candle! Darling, what we have been through and what else will come! If I only had some response from you so I would know what my story means to you. Now, I'm thinking if this has any sense at all. Dear brother, don't doubt the meaning of your story and don't leave me without it... In return, I will tell you a part of my story. I will first tell you how I recently, by accident, happened to come to Kulina. I went to an excursion with my class. This is the river Una! My hometown is near! Cvjetkovic! Turn that off! Everyone's still sleeping. Fuck you, you fucking... Professor, aren't they nice? Are you mad? I'm responsible for your health! Let me change! You fucking idiot! I will send them back to Belgrade by the first train. You fucking idiot, you ruined my trip. So what? It's like shit from the very beginning. Yeah, shit... The professors are mad with us, we're fucked now. Come on, coward, let's run away if you dare! - Run away where? Anywhere. - Cut the shit. I have a grandmother nearby. We can go to her. Let's go! - And there is also my home village, Kulina. Let's go! God, what have we done! - Fuck it! No time for regrets now. - It's a bit stuffy. Terrible! - Well, no one has been here for years. What is this? Hallo! Who's there? What are you doing? It's me, aunt! - When did you arrive? A moment ago. I'm going to Split with my class, so I stopped by to see the house. - Good, good... Are you hungry, thirsty? - No, we're fine, aunt. Aunt, listen! Can you send this gusle player to the hills to take care of the goats? He's so boring! - What? Nothing, nothing, aunt. Good night. You told me Anica was your only true love. Seems strange to me now. Didn't Vranka tell you about our love? Her parents started taking her to the fairs early. This boy is ready for marriage. Yes, he is. But they won't give him Anica. - They'd rather drown her. Why didn't you come to my home? Officer Kovacevic came. He returned the needle through his nose. He swallows a bean and returns it through his eyes. Foolish girl, what do you need him for? You know his father. What are we going to do with him? - Send him to the army. I'll arrange they call him immediately. We'll find him a job in the city and he'll find another girl. Good evening! Sit down! There are no chairs for you in this house! - Mother! Why did you throw that decent boy out of the house? He's a Bunjevac. Besides, his father was an ustasha! He did nothing wrong. - They're all the same. Come, daughter. Come here. I have someone for you and I won't miss this chance. - Who? Petar Sorgic, police officer. - But he's 15 years older! Border infantry. They gave me the worst because of my father. And, where is that Maribor? - On the Austrian border. I'll wait for you! I'd go anywhere with you. Sorgic brought my father a sack of beans. He must have taken it from the prisoners in jail. He can do anything he pleases. - It doesn't matter. I'll send the letters for you to Vranka, and you write me back. I will! - Come on! Josip! My father was an ustasha. Partisans killed him in 1942. I could feel it. My father was an ustasha too. The chetnics killed him in 1941. That's why they fuck us more than anyone else. And we will always be blamed for everything. It will never be well for us in this country. I am going across the border as soon as I finish the army. I can't. I have a girl. She's waiting for me. Well, Gavran, you turned out to be a good soldier. I see you finished your training with a good grade. It's a pity for you to stay in the barracks. It would be good if you took a course for dog keepers. And what is that? - You will be keeping dogs. It can also do you good when you leave the army. All right. - Listen, your job will be to take the dogs from one border barrack to another, to get new soldiers accustomed to old dogs and new dogs to old soldiers. Nothing else. I accept. - Excellent! Someone is waiting for you at the gate. It's you? - My father arranged the wedding with Sorgic. I asked Vranka for your address, took the train and here I am. Come on. Sit down. What now? I'm not going back to Kulina. I'll wait for you here until you get out of the army. Where will you wait for me? How? I'll find a job in the city. Let's go to town. We'll think of something. We could go to my captain. Maybe he will understand. I want to help you, but I don't know how. What you have on your mind is wrong. Completely wrong. Braco, you go back to your barracks. The girl will stay here until tomorrow. Thank you in advance, comrade captain. Tomorrow we'll see what we can do. Good morning! Easy, comrade. Wait, let's talk about it. We'll talk about it, comrade captain, through the state officials if needed! That's how the love between Anica and me came to an end. Tomorrow, at dawn, the captain expressed his regrets and sent me to take the dogs to The Holly Ghost border barracks. I stayed there. I finished the course for dog keepers and until today, I kept close to dogs. Zuca! Veselin! Veselin, darling! Get up! It's nine! Hello, aunt! My poor thing. You didn't even send me a postcard. Sorry, aunt. I'm guilty. Here, I brought you some yogurt. I know you're hungry. - Thank you. Darling, Petar and I mowed the clover on your meadow. We couldn't ask you. Here's the money. - Thank you, aunt. Go on mowing the meadows, so the earth isn't idle. Aunt, have a drink. - I can't, I don't drink. I know, aunt. If you insist. Just to take the dew of my heart. This is for your health. Welcome. No more, please. I wouldn't if you forced me to. - Go on. No, please. That villain of mine will kill me. You've been there? - Yes. Did he offer you? - You know I don't drink. Blow! You know her husband, Sorgic. The bread she eats with him is bitterer than anything. She started drinking. Where've you been? - Around. What are you doing so early? Did you buy cigarettes? - No. It's fucking ten, man. What are we going to smoke? Hey, you have an air rifle. Can I take it? Go ahead, but I think it's rusted. What do you mean? Look at it. It's as good as new. You have bullets in that green box over there. What happened? Look at him. Well, say something. Fuck you, woman! How did you put that tape? Hey? I told you, you are only good for the shovel. Cvijetkovic Vranka. Cvijetkovic Krstan. Hey, who are those? My parents. I'm sorry. Dear brother, it was easier for me to read your letters. When you hear the voice, even if it's from this box, you can feel a live human being. You'd like to see him and everything gets complicated. It hurts me so much because Vranka's bones will remain in the Orthodox soil. I haven't told you about my job. In order to be a good dog keeper, I have to be almost equal with the dogs. I haven't shaved this morning, nor washed my teeth, because I mustn't have any smell on me which could disturb their perfect senses. But, to go back to the story. Darling, I gave birth to a child. Three months ago. I was ashamed to write you. We named him Veselin, so our home would always be merry. Nice name, isn't it? Where is your hearth? We are the only ones in Kulina with a stove and a painted room. The only ones! I'll go get the wine. You prepare the ham. We are celebrating today. This suit is nice. Don't take it off, so the neighbors can see. Oh, dear. What's this now? - He spent the company money on the stove. I told him not to do that. My wife just gave birth to our son. She can't trouble herself by a hearth! It's stealing. You are a member of the Party. You'll be fired. I brought a policeman to take you to jail. I'll give back the money. It's in the barn. What do you know? An honest man... A good forest keeper, member of the Communist Party. Krstan! Come on, we don't have all day. Hey, he hung himself! His tongue fell to his balls! Give me a knife! A knife! Give me an axe! Where is it? Come on, give me an axe. I have never gone back to Kulina again. I met Josip in Austria among our people. I never saw Vranka again, nor wrote her a letter. She never showed how much it hurt her. You know our Vranka. She raised me and dreamt of finishing the house Krstan started building. I'm a postman for 9 years and I never brought good news to this house. Now I should get a drink. A letter from my brother Braco? - No, it's not. Krstan's pension. Let's go inside. - What are you ashamed of? You didn't steal it. First we'll count it, then we'll drink. All the installments belonging to you have arrived. It's just that you didn't ask for them on time. Sign this now. Good. Good luck. I'm afraid that everything will be finished before this. Don't you worry about that. - Not to worry about what? I'll bet you we'll make the first plate. How is it going, women? Need any help? Can you? - She can, she can. You turkey! Vranka, I'll show you how to keep the concrete from cracking. They are going to Smrekovo to get the bride. People, this is not a wedding! Turn the machine off! Listen to this! Look! Come here! Today, July 20th, 1971, a branch of the Croatian Mainstream is being established in Smrekovo. They threw this out of the bus. Who isn't a Croat may as well leave the Croatian land. People, I was fired from my job! They retired me! And why? Why?! Because I'm a Serb! People... Anything can happen. Not so much, not so much! There goes a bus full of Catholic priests and nuns. Tell us, what's going on in Smrekovo? God forbid! How would I know? - You know! You know. I haven't been in Smrekovo for 20 years. I think you are one of them, that you work for them. I don't know anything. I swear by my only son. We came here to help you with the house, and now you want to have us all slaughtered. Let's go to Smrekovo to see what's happening. - Let's go! Our Croatian name and nation didn't appear yesterday. It is known to the world for more than a thousand years... People, give a donation for our Stipica. The Croats came from the Iranian plateau, former Persia, the cradle of all the Aryan nations. The well-related Croatian tribes went towards the sunny south and wonderful coasts of the Adriatic Sea. Croats were granted a wonderful land, full of treasures... Look how many red ones! I have a thousand. I'll put it on the table and take the red. I'll try and take two. And the thing that matters most to them. The holly Catholic religion. My people... The Croatian flowers have a wonderful scent... They have grown out of the bones of our... Tomislavs, Zvonimirs... I saw everything, but I won't tell anyone. - Swear. I swear by Vranka. Darling, I fell asleep. I took it out, so we are close to the plate. Lucky me and lucky you. May the plate be raised in peace. We all know what a martyr you are. People! Dinara is on fire! Vranka! You have to come. One is coming from each house to put out the fire. Please let me stay. I have to water the plate. Veselin can water it. He's not a baby any more. Come on. Do you know what to do? - I know. Dinara didn't burst into flames by itself. I set the fire. It was Sunday, July 30th, 1971, the day you made the plate. It was the first time I came to my homeland after 12 years, with someone else's passport. My mission was to set my own mountain on fire. I didn't sleep well, my hands are sweaty. - It's hot like hell. It's not because of that. A foot away is Smrekovo and my father's grave. There's Kulina. My Vranka is there. - The mission is clear. No turning off the road. Leave your feelings for another time. I left Vranka without saying goodbye when she needed me most. If I could only give her a sign, something only she would understand. Today, a branch of Croatian Mainstream is being established in Smrekovo. From early morning... - Way to go, Smrekovo! Unbelievable! We met twice on that July 30th. I was one of those two boys. I know the police listens to this before you do. This is my confession. That's why they let us talk this way. It's good because we can't see each other. "What is glowing on the Dinara? A letter U on Pavelic's head!" Veselin, darling. Do you know this is the fifth year since we started building? We learnt to do something by ourselves too. Today, we could put the concrete onto the floor. What now? Why did this thing stop working? I don't know. I'm not a mechanic. Neither am I, but... Uncle Petar! Uncle Petar, quick! What? - Mother was killed by an electric shock. Electric shock? - Vranka! Wait! Wait! How do we approach her? I'm not Tesla, you know. What can you do? She was a great martyr. Veselin, you're a real man now. Does he have any close relatives? Not really. Can he take care of himself? The kid should be sent to a home. It would be best for him to spend the night in our house. Let's go, Veselin, darling. I suggest we check if there is any cash in the closet. We should take care of this woman's funeral. I, as the president of the community must be present. You're sleeping alone in the house. - I'm not afraid. I'll sleep in the other room. - No need, I'm not scared. The things the martyr left should be burned. Why don't you come and eat at our house? No need. I eat in the city at my friends' homes. Letter! Who is it from? - From abroad. Sent by Braco Gavran. It's not addressed to you, but to your late mother. Dear and only mother, I've been dreaming of you two nights in a row. Always the same dream. You are young, happy and smiling like you have never been before nor will you ever be. I know well the meaning of dreams. Please, reply to me briefly how you are and if you need my help. I read that letter a hundred times. I know it by heart. How to reply to an unknown half brother? When you find out Vranka died, will I ever hear from you again? I didn't want to break the last bond with the closest person I have. Children, let's talk about our prom night. Where are we going? - To Hotel Yugoslavia. Boys should prepare suits, girls dresses, so it all goes as it should. Nothing will be tolerated at the prom night. Is that clear? The prom is a maturity test. As for you three, there were worse suggestions. It could have happened that you didn't go to the prom at all. So, you can be satisfied. This is the end. No more empty talking. A deaf man can't hear a deaf man. Your voice means a lot to me. How can I trust your voice, when I don't recognize my own? It's good to have a brother. - I don't even believe you exist. I destroyed all your letters, tapes, pictures. Your picture is looking at me. - I don't exist, you don't exist. Our tormented lives were invented by our common villains. I'll be there as soon as I get out. - Don't cross the border, don't burden people with my description. - I'll find you. If you do find me, you won't find me. I'll become the dew, the sun will absorb me. What am I going to do with you, Gavran? My partners are inviting me to Yugoslavia to hunt bears, and you can't go there. Find comeone to replace you. What did you do wrong there? Gavran! Every man must have a homeland... A family... This is not good, Gavran. It's not... Veselin! Braco! What's going on there? Stop it! Keep moving! It's OK. Leave them. Go on, go on over there.
