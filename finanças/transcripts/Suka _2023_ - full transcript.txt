[soft tense music] [sirens] [traffic whines] [tense music builds] [man on radio] Police are trying to curb an escalating Dawood Yang turf war in Sydney following the murder of the head of the Dawood clan, 63-year-old Adam Dawood, 18 months ago. The Yang family has been linked to numerous assassinations in these gang wars over Old River Street and are feeling the heat. Detectives are yet to make any arrests. There are fears there will be more bloodshed on the horizon. According to one shop owner... [woman on radio] The conflict's over turf and money. The Yang's, they're very ruthless and impulsive. They do whatever the hell they want. [man on radio] A spokesperson from the Yang family has rebuffed this remark. [woman on radio] Yeah, we fight to protect our turf. As dumb as that sounds to most people, for us out here, it's something to die for. [man on radio] Adam's son, Joshua Dawood, has issued a statement of reassurance for residents and business owners in the area. [Joshua on radio] Those Yang's think they're above the law. We will not be taking a foot off the accelerator. That's not how real businessmen operate, is it? And after I'm done, everyone on Old River Street will be safe. I promise you that. [soft tense music] [mouths words] [music builds and stops] [soft music] Oh, thank you. Thank you. No, no, no. No, no, no. Stand up. It's OK, I've got you. [tense music] Fandi. You know I'm loyal to your father. Thank you. What are you doing hanging out with the Dawood dogs, huh? Talk or I'll start cutting chunks out of you. Please. Sorry I'm late. Your favourite. Taro cake. Tough day? It's all gonna be worth it. All this risk. I promise, Wasiya. [soft music] Happy birthday, my love. [man] Hey, just letting myself in. Hope I'm not interrupting. Not at all, Yasin. For the birthday girl. Longjing green tea. For health and longevity. Love it. Yeah, well, I was starting to go grey waiting for my best mate here to knock you up. Hey. Yeah, for a while there I thought he'd only be married to his shops, too. I'm just glad you made me see what I was missing. Sorry, I've got to go. But I will see you at the store tomorrow, right? Yeah, yeah, for sure. I'll have a look at your books and see what's going on. Great, thanks. [soft tense music] She's kicking. This one's a fighter I can tell. Can't wait to see her, Wasiya. [sinister music] This is for crossing my father! [grunts and groans] [gasps] Joshua! No! Wasiya... [kettle boils] [screams] [shrieks] Bitch! How dare you! Please don't hurt my baby! Please! [screams] [baby crying] It's OK. It's alright, my beautiful Hui. It's alright. [baby cries] Shh-shh-shh. [man on phone] Are you there? Can you hear me? Just need to keep you on the line. We have people on the way to your location. Please respond. [solemn music] Look what we have now, hey? I'm doing this for your daddy. Be careful! [soft tense music] Don't let her get away, Zayd! [tense music] What's going on? It's not safe for you here anymore. [dramatic music] [soft tense music] [dramatic music builds] [grunting] [dramatic beat] [grunts and groans] [dramatic music fades] [moans] How long have you been watching us? What have you told the gangs? Nothing yet. How much will it take to buy your silence? Take care of it. Why do I need to leave? All my friends are here. If I had a dad, I wouldn't have to go. He would want me around, not like you! Hui, I want you around all the time. Just like I did with your father. He worked so hard. Did so much for our community. But I am not your father. I can't do what I need to do for him and for you. I can't protect... Protect... Who? Me? Why? Nothing, Hui. This place, Old River Street, is our home. But I want you to have a better life away from here. Your father would have wanted that. I still don't want to go. We have no choice now. The decision has been made for us. You're all I have left. I can't lose you too. Wasiya, I hear you're going to buy my property. Not even a happy birthday? I'm busy... and far too old for foreplay. Sell your land to me, and I'll protect you from the Yangs. [laughs] Only an insane person will sell to you. I pay my dues, plus extras, and he leaves me alone. The system works fine. The old dragon is dying. His troops are deserting him. Now is the time to strike. That's your problem. Why are you so determined to join your husband? He tried to stand up to the Yangs. Such a tragedy. If you sell to me... I promise you that you and your family will never live in fear again. Same story, different players. Sorry. You'll see my offer is more than generous. You are the oldest store owner on Old River Street. Your neighbours will follow suit. A united front against the Yangs. I don't like to play games with chance. I can't change the beginning, Bing. I can change the ending. [pensive music] Hui has been avoiding my calls again, Wasiya. [gasps] What are you doing here? Mr Bo Yang. I hope your trek to my side of Old River Street hasn't dirtied your new white sneakers. I came as a courtesy to our truce as neighbours. So that will be as civil as I'll ever be. Hell must have frozen over, Rini. The Yang's are being civil. You really don't get it, do you? See, this is me trying to... [yells] [dramatic music] Come on. [grunts] [yells] [laughs] Don't you know what this means? Disrespect you little shit? Say the word, Wasiya. No. You are not your father. Thank you, Arlo. There's got to be a better way. [soft music] [sirens] Oi! Hey! Oh. Fuck this place. Would you get Arlo for me? [soft pensive music] [gasps] [voices murmur] [soft tense music] [soft grunts] [Fandi] You're in trouble again, little brother. Aren't you supposed to be on probation or something? No more cigars, Mr Yang. I'll let you go to your next patient now. Careful not to bust a vein and beat the cancer, Dad. I've had enough of this fucking bullshit. Fuck off, old man. Ah! [yells] [groans] [gasps and wheezes] Why so difficult, my son? Even with this cancer eating away at me, I'm still more of a man than you. You act like a dog you'll be treated like a dog. Get off me Dad! This jung... means death. This jung means clock. Therefore a clock is a sign of bad luck... and a form of disrespect to be given as a gift, especially for a birthday present. I thought you hate the Dawoods? My son, you do not poison the well you will drink from later. [coughs] My time is nearly come, Bo. Your time is nearly here. The business. I'm not gonna take over the business, Dad. Let Fandi have it. You are my son! It's tradition. Bo... don't forget we have a job tomorrow. [soft rattling drum] [pensive music] [metal rings] Happy birthday. I hate that word. Oh, you're out of practice. Well, business majors don't make for good sparring partners. Or do they? [grunts] I hope that MBA was worth it. Your gym's not looking so good. Maybe I could help you tidy it up a bit. Just hasn't taken off like I hoped yet. [grunts] How's your family? You've never met my family. You never wanted me to. Ooh, Hui! Hui! Ah. I'm gonna get you on the next one. You really are out of practice, aren't you? Alright, let's see here. So you gonna go see your mother today? [sighs] Not that again. I mean, you know, you're the only good thing in my life growing up here. Let the past make you better? Not bitter. -Remember that? -Mm. Yeah, I do. I was the one who told you. Yeah, alright, I'll go see her. It's still early. Sweet. I'll meet you back at my place. I'll get supplies. Sorry, single guy, empty fridge. So I have to sleep on the couch again? Prices are higher when you're flying solo. [soft music] No, my balloon! Hey, what are you doing? You almost pushed her in. Hey, that woman just saved your daughter's life, man. Are you OK? Wow. That was a lot of effort for one little balloon. Well, I didn't do it for the balloon, I did it for the little girl. You know, I could have just bought her a bunch of balloons to replace that one. Well, that's not what she wanted, and you did nothing to save what she really wanted. Well, maybe. Maybe not. See, in the end, it didn't matter so much after all, eh? You know what? Everyone's actions make a difference, no matter how small. Oh, I see. I see your point. And my name's Bo, by the way. How would you like to have a coffee with me, you know, so we can talk about my inactions? See how I'm being proactive now? Is this the best pickup line you can come up with? It's not a pickup. Oh, really? You know what? I'm kind of hungry. Ah, that sounds good. [soft electronic music] Mm. Wow, I've never seen a girl eat so much. I am impressed. Obviously, you don't know the right girls. Oh oh oh. I'm just really hungry. And jet-lagged. And there was no food at my friend's place. Friend or... boyfriend? Why? You jealous? No. Should I be? Would you be disappointed if I said he was just a friend? No, no, I think I'm quite good with that. Did you have something better to do other than watch me eat my noodles? No, I was... I was just trying to get away from an overbearing parent. What happened? You know, Asian parents just... can't do anything to please them. At least you have a parent who actually wants you around. Yeah, sometimes I... I do wonder about that, though. You want some of my noodles? Mm. It'll make you feel better. Hot and spicy. Maybe like me. Do you reckon you can handle it? Pretty sure I can handle it. How hot and spicy can you handle? Well... Who's this? Fandi, this is... Hui. Hui. This is my sister, Fandi. Do I know you? Uh, no, I don't think so. Mm-hm. We gotta go. Oh, really? Sorry, um... how about I'll give you a call? OK. [soft music] We have to be back in the club soon. [phone rings] Hello? Yasin? You wanted to see me? What are you doing? What's going on? Don't speak. I'm so sorry. I have no choice. Everyone has a choice, Yasin? The Yang's will come for my family... unless I kill you. [phone message tone] They're coming. [gasps] It's the only way. There's always a better way, Yasin. Stop it. [groans] [yells] Ah! -[grunts] -[yells] [yells] [soft tense music] I'm so sorry. I have no choice. I have to do this. If I don't kill you, they'll come for my family. [grunts] [knife clatters] Yasin? Yasin? [Yasin yells] [Wasiya shrieks] [gasps] Oh. Ah. [shrieks and moans] [breathes heavily] [groans] [Rini] Yeah, we shouldn't be too late but you know what she's like. You know. I'll call you back. Wasiya? Wasiya! Wasiya! [tense music] Yasin, you don't have to do this. We can fight the Yangs together! No one can stop the Yangs. Not the police, not anyone! [music builds] [Rini yells] Hey! God. Rini. Yasin... we're family. I'm so sorry. Hey! What do you think you're doing? [tense music builds] You OK? We've gotta go. Don't stay over me. Hold him. We've got questions. What are you gonna do with him? [car horn toots] [Jay groans] [tense music pulses] Let's go, Bo. You let him go. Don't worry. It won't take us long to find him. I owe you. Thank you. Oh, I only did what was right. There's too much violence in this town. Yeah, well, I'm trying to fix that. What's your name? Jay. Jay? I'm Wasiya. Let me say thank you for protecting me. I own a nightclub. You can come for dinner and a drink anytime. It's not necessary. Small price to pay for my life. Your appreciation's enough. Good night. Find out who he works for. [soft tense music] [electronic music] [exhales] [Yasin] Yeah, well, I was starting to go grey waiting for my best mate here to knock you up. [Young Wasiya] It's all right, my beautiful Hui. [baby cries] [Young Wasiya wails] Remember to rinse your mouth out with water after you eat. Otherwise you'll get holes in your teeth. Yeah, I know, Mum. [soft solemn music] Make sure you wash your face in the morning. Every day before class. It's so far away. You're going to one of the best boarding schools in the country. It'll be fun, Hui. They've got a great fencing club. You can still take Kung Fu. Still come see you during the holidays. Promise me you'll be careful and behave yourself. Otherwise your teachers won't like you. [soft solemn music] You're really are very lucky, you know? Father and I never had the chance for an education like this. Go. Otherwise you'll miss your flight. Hui! [Joshua] It's all gonna be worth it. All this risk. It will all be worth it, Joshua, I promise. [electronic beeps] Morning. Morning. How did you sleep? Good. Sorry I missed you last night. Oh, it's all right. Did you go see your mother? Uh...yeah. I'll go and see her today. Are you going to introduce me finally? You're hurt? Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it. [groans] -Are you okay? -Mm. What happened? I stumbled into a fight last night. What? Some lady was being attacked. Does it hurt like this? The guy got away, but the lady was fine. What's with this place? [phone rings] Hi. Yeah. Oh, yeah. No, I'm free. [soft music] No, I'm telling you, they use like real flowers in this store. See? [both laugh] Now, this gotta be real, right? [sniffs] You have to try to smell it. No, it's not. So you're looking for an apology gift? What did you do? Pissed off my father. [soft music] Oh, take this one. [pensive music] [bottles clink in background] You have a visitor. Welcome Jay. Please, sit. No thanks. I don't want any trouble, ma'am. Please, call me Wasiya. It's no trouble. Just showing appreciation for your assistance earlier. I'd like to offer you a job, if you choose. Why me? You're capable of hiring anyone. Well, you're honest and hardworking. Rarity these days. Plus, you need cash, am I right? Your gym's not doing too well. I don't know. Rini...how did we first meet? Must have been ten years ago now, right? You found me homeless in front of one of your shops. Wasiya saved my life. I don't think I could ever repay her. OK. Wise choice. In advance, for your first month's work. -My lady? -Oh. [giggles] Um... Would you... Yeah? -Would you like to... -Yeah? Come in for a-- [Jay] Hui? Ah, Jay. Hi. Um...this is Bo. Hui. Anyone but this guy. This is your friend? -Hui, he was there last night. -Hey, you shut up. -Or what? -Or what? Whoa! What are you doing? Stop! Guys, stop! Stop. Jay, stop. What are you doing? Jay! [Bo groans] What was that? Be careful, Hui. This man's a snake. Jay! [sighs] [Bo groans] Are you OK? Jeez. Next time, tell me if your friend's a pro, OK? -Let's get out of here. -Ah. [soft pensive music] [Bo] Hm. Oh. -Does it hurt? -No, it's okay. [soft pensive music] Come here. [pensive music builds] [laughs] You don't need to worry about Jay. He's one of my oldest friends. Think he wants to be more than just friends, Hui. [Hui] Nah. He's like a brother to me, Bo. That's all. [yells] Yeah. [man] Stop! Stop! Come here! [man] Come back here, boy! Hey! [coins rattle] Tommy, I remember you. Jail time for you, boy. -Now listen... -Bo, what are you doing? Don't move. If you steal again, you know that I'm going to find you. Take that. Use it wisely. Now beat it. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. It's alright. See that? Yeah? It's alright. [upbeat electronic music] [laughs] [phone rings] Sorry, it's my sister. Sorry, this won't take long. Fandi, this is getting fucking ridiculous, alright? [Fandi] Where are you? I've been waiting. Yeah, well, I've got my own fucking thing going on here. We need to see Auntie Bing. Now, Bo. Yeah, yeah. Alright. Look, I've got to run a little errand for my dad, but why don't you tag along? There'll be food at the end of this. -Oh, really? -Yeah. -Yeah. -And it might end with a bed. -Oh, really? -Yeah. You know you're going. OK, you don't mind waiting just for a little while in the car, right? I'll be right back. OK, sure. Dumplings and noodles. Dumplings and noodles. Be right back, my dumpling. [clears throat] Got it. [tense music builds] Who's there? Oh, it's you. What do you want? Rumour has it you plan to sell to Wasiya? Nonsense. You know I'll never do that. How many years have I been loyal to Jun? Well, our evidence seems to suggest otherwise. Your lawyer's more honest than you. [chuckles] What did you do? Please, no. I have children. I have grandchildren. I have great-grandchildren. And they'll be very well looked after. Please, no, Bo-Boy. Remember, you used to come to my shop, and I gave you potluck after school. [eerie tense music] No, please, no. No. [moans softly] For real? Father needs this to be done. Please, no. [dramatic music swells] -Fandi, that... -That... That was you dropping the ball again, Bo-Boy. What don't you understand? When Dad's gone, they'll come after me and you. We have to show them you don't mess with the Yangs. Yeah, but... Hui... Hui! Hui, let me explain this. Tie up the loose ends. Clean this shit up, Bo. No. Fandi, no. Fandi, don't. Oh, no, you don't, you little bitch. Fandi, no, no. No, Hui don't run [Hui groans] Hui! [eerie music] Hui, oh my God. Hui? Oh, come on. It's just a scratch. I could have killed her, you know. [eerie tense music] [Bo] Wow. [Hui] I never asked for your name. [Bo] That was a lot of effort for one little balloon. [Jay] Be careful, Hui. [Hui] He's like a brother to me, Bo. [Jay] This man's a snake. [Hui] Jay, stop! Bo, what are you doing? Jay! [Bo] You know where you're going. [gunshot] [Hui groans] Oh! [Hui moans] [Hui coughs] Ow! Where the fuck are you taking me? Let me out! I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean for any of that to happen. -I'm sorry, Hui. -Who the fuck are you? Please, just calm down. -Who are you? -Please, OK? Take me home. None of this was meant to happen. You weren't supposed to come out of the car. I didn't know it was going to happen. -I didn't know. -I trusted you. I trusted you! I trusted you! I trusted you! You'll be safe. I will make sure of it, OK? I want to see my mum. Take me to see my mum. [tense music builds] [music fades] [ferry horn sounds] [Hui moans softly] [grunts] I'm so sorry, Hui. Hui, this is not the life that I wanted. You don't have to believe me. I really didn't mean for any of this to happen. I'm so sorry. [crickets chirp softly] Bo. What now? Baba wants to see you. [soft tense music] Resting. Luckily, there's no permanent damage. Dad, I don't care what background she's from. I thought you might say that. My curiosity got the better of me, so I did some digging around. Can you two just stay out of my life? She is Wasiya's daughter, you reckless boy. Her only child. [chuckles] She can't be. Do you know what this means? [Jun laughs] Fandi, don't you dare touch her! Fandi! [tense music] Where did she go? Hui? Hui? [electronic music pulses] Whoa, what are you doing, mate? [chuckles] Rini, the new hire is out the back, and drunk. Come deal with it, please. You've gotta watch where you're going, mate. I'm just trying to have a good time. [Jay] Alright. [Rini] Let's take a... Sit down. Alright. Sit down. [Jay] Alright, alright, alright. I'll get him some painkillers and water. Be right back. -Are you OK? -Yeah. What have you been doing? [pensive music] [electronic dance music] [electronic dance music] [music fades] [Hui groans] [softly] Hui it's me, it's me! Shh! Look, I've got you. OK? Hui, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Hui. Look, my family, they... I really shouldn't have brought you here. Please, just follow me. [grunts] You should stop thinking with your dick little brother. Hello. Uh. Ah! [yells] You're coming with me! [Hui yells] [Rini] Wasiya. Wasiya! Jun has your daughter. What? When did she get back? [sighs] Jun? What have you done with Hui? If you hurt her, I swear to God-- Come to my house in one hour. Alone. When will this pointless feud ever end, Jun? When we're all dead? There are worse things than death, Wasiya. We'll get her back. Hui will be all right. I'll come with you. No, I'll go alone. I know what the Yangs are capable of. [pensive music] Prepare for our special guest. Rini, can you get my car, please? [Rini] Yep, on it. You, Rini, and Arlo know what to do if something happens to me, right? Yeah. OK. Wasiya! Wasiya, wait! -What? -I need to get this straight. Hui is your daughter? Yeah, so? Right, I'm coming with you. Why? I've known Hui my whole life. She never mentioned you. Of course she hasn't. You were never around. You have no idea. Tell me this... is all this worth more than your daughter's happiness? Everything I have done is for my family. For Hui. I don't have time for this. -Wasiya, wait! -No. Hui needs me, OK? Do you have anything for a hangover? [Hui groans] [groans] Are you alright? Who the fuck are you? I'm... a disgraced member of your family. My family? I know your mother very well. My mother? What about her? There's something to be said about a woman who manages to overcome everything that was meant to destroy her. I think you have the wrong woman. My mother has led a very privileged life. No. No, I don't think so. Your mother... it hasn't been easy for her ever since the day you were born. What makes you say that? Your father was my best friend. And I was meant to keep you both safe. These people... The Yangs... They make you do things that... You never... you never thought you would. I... I'm sorry. I did... I betrayed your father. Tell me everything. You know, the first time I met Hui was at Kung Fu class. We would have been eight, nine. I just remember being in such awe of her because she had beat opponents twice her size. Best moment was when she... absolutely destroyed this one bad kid, Vaughan. He was such a bully. All the other students were scared of him, right? But...not her. Not Hui. Why didn't I say anything to her sooner? I know I've always loved her. And now this thing with her mum... God, man. I really messed up. I don't know what I'll do if anything happens to her. Save it for your therapist. [gags] Special recipe. [coughs] If you go now, you'll catch up with Rini. She's planning on tailing Wasiya. You're letting me go? Why? All I care about is Wasiya and Hui's safety. Not orders. [soft tense music] [door bell rings] [soft tense music] Hui looks like her father. Scar suits you after this. Welcome. This is just a taste. Here she is. Wasiya Dawood. Welcome to my home. Where is my daughter? So now I am old. And I, like you, am tired of all this bickering. I was at a loss of what to do when a son brings home a woman that turns out to be none other than your daughter. Who would have thought, Wasiya, my son with your only child? Disgusting. I took the initiative with my lawyers to draw up some paperwork. If you want all this to end, you will transfer the ownership of all your land along Old River Street to me. I'm not going to sign anything... until I know my daughter is alive. Fandi! She wants a reunion. We shall oblige. Sure. So now, Wasiya, I have only one son. And you have only one child. And I don't want to see anyone else in our families get hurt. [Fandi] Get in there! -And you too. -Mum! -Get over there! -Hui! Oh, how nice. The whole family back together again. A pity you didn't know you had a rat among you. Wasiya, I'm so, so sorry. Mum, Yasin told me everything. Why didn't you tell me? I couldn't. I wanted to protect you from this, all this. Why didn't we just leave? We could have just gone away. I didn't want to let your father down. Oh, enough of this sappy bullshit. Get up! No, Mum, don't do it! [yells] Hui! [Hui sobs] Sign it! Sign the papers now! [screams] [gasps] [groans] Wasiya! Hui! [screams] Oh Dad! Come on, Hui! What is it? I'm going to get them! Wasiya! Hui, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Wasiya, let me apologise. Please let me help, OK? Just follow me. -Jay! -What have you done? You can trust him he's trying to help. -Stop it! -Stop. Bo, show us the way. Don't touch her. Just let's get out of here, Mum. Watch your step. Watch your step. Follow me. Come on, follow me. Stay out of sight. [yells] Rini? Rini, stop. Fandi. Fandi! Fandi! No, no, no. You traitor, get the fuck away from me! -[Rini moans] -I got it, I got it. Here. Just there. What are you doing with this family? Let them go. [indistinct speech] [gunshot] Hui? [sinister music] No! No, Hui! Hui! Hui! Bo! Hui? Hui! -Hui, how is she? -This is all your fault! No! Get off me! [dramatic music] Get off him! Get off him! [grunts and groans] Ah! This is for my husband. Please. [gasps] Dad! Baba! [sobs] Wasiya! [screams] [soft tense music] Dad! Fandi. [Bo sobs] Fandi... So bad. The Yang's assets are frozen. If you'd like to buy them out, they're all yours. Finally. And, uh... What now? Bo's disappeared. My sources can't find him anywhere. With Jun gone, the police still protect him. Living in fear is just another way of dying before your time. Find him.
