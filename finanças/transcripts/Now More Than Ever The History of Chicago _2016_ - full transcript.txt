[crowd cheering] I'll be up in a minute. [indistinct chatter] [music playing] Feeding back. [Walter Parazaider] The inception of the band was an assembly of the best musicians I could find in the city of Chicago. We actually discussed about making the best band we could possibly make. That the band would be a musical democracy, and I said, "When you give me your hand, that'll be the contract, and the only way you get out of it is to ask out or you die." [Robert Lamm] I've always thought of Chicago in terms of a family, rather than eras. You know, in a span of 40 or 50 years, there are going to be changes. And I don't care if it's a family or a band, there are going to be changes. The realization becomes, you know, we're all replaceable. [LAUGHS] We're all replaceable. ["Beginnings" playing] [Lee Loughnane] Our first pictures were in a foundation of a building. And we had suits, and we, you know, we picked up shovels. We were, like, leaning on shovels and stuff. [Lamm] I enjoyed playing music. I enjoyed playing in all the groups that I had played in up to then, which were, like, three or four different combinations. But I really enjoyed playing with these guys. You know, it was a whole other animal. [Loughnane] Robert has always been a songwriter, ever since I met him. When he joined the band, he had a book of 50 songs. I remember meeting him at DePaul and he had a notebook this thick full of lyrics. And I just remember he said, "Well, I've got a few songs here." And I just said, "Well, you know, they might come in handy one day." [Danny Seraphine] In those days there weren't bands, you know. There were singers, individual singers, and the bands backed up the singers. While we were playing in the clubs, we were doing what other, other bands do. We were playing covers. ["I'll be Back" playing] ♪ You know, If you break my heart I'll go ♪ LAMM: The club owners wanted us to play stuff that people could dance to, and then drink, and they would make money and you know, hopefully fill the club. LOUGHNANE: We started playing one song called Clouds, and we got fired. [LAUGHS] Because we did an original song and he wanted to hear a top 40. SERAPHINE: But it was exciting. Because, really, we had gotten a chance to really hear what the band sounded like. ♪ I love you so ♪ You know, we wore the suits, and we did the steps. "Good evening ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Club Gigi, "we're gonna warm it up with a couple of belly rubbers." It was an entirely different uh, attitude towards playing music. LAMM: And then eventually we began to arrange those songs for the instrumentation of Chicago. That's when we got into some dispute. JOE MANTEGNA: We'd get a call on a Saturday night at, like, 9:00 saying, "This goddamn band, Chicago Transit Authority... "They won't play the top 40 shit. The kids hate it!" [STUTTERS] "We're getting rid of them after the next break." Can you come down and finish the night? ♪ You, if you break my heart I'll go ♪ MANTEGNA: And there would be the boys packing up their stuff, you know, and they're pissed. And we're thinking to ourselves, why don't they just lighten up? Why don't they just play the, you know, give them a little Rolling Stones... [LAUGHS] Give them a little Temptations if they want it, or whatever. But we're thinking, "Eh, you know, they gotta go their own way." LOUGHNANE: Terry came on stage at Barnaby's on State Street in Chicago and I think it was during the first tune, he just ripped the shirt, the coat, right off of his back. [INTRODUCTION PLAYING] And that was it. We went straight to hippie-dom. LAMM: Then we started doing original material, and it was a small group of people that dug it. Kind of the legend around Illinois was the Chicago Transit Authority had been formed out of these local super groups. MANTEGNA: You know, as we watched them play, we were all like, "Wow, these guys can really read music." [LAUGHS] "These guys really know what they're doing." [QUESTIONS 67 AND 68 PLAYING] Playing in a band with horns, with you guys, was extraordinary, but, but, um, but Terry Kath's talent was just amazing. Terry and I hung out a lot together. Terry's the kinda guy that made up his own vocabulary and his own context. And also the way that Danny played drums. PANKOW: Danny, he had a feel, an R&amp;B back thing, I mean, wow. SERAPHINE: Terry, Walt, and myself were a band of brothers. We were... We were inseparable. We were really, really close and had already been through a lot together. But Peter, he was a great, great singer. I mean, When I first heard his voice, I'm like, "Wow!" ♪ Can this feeling that we have together ♪ IRVING AZOFF: Peter Cetera had been in another band called The Exceptions. That's my earliest recollection of knowing anything about Chicago. ♪ Did this meeting of our minds together ♪ Our first gig, uh, was at the Club Gigi, an upholstered sewer on the south side of Chicago. The only people in the audience were my parents. I mean, it was just, yeah, you know, "Yeah! Yeah! "This is great!" LOUGHNANE: Something happened in me that I decided that this is what I wanted to do for a living. As soon as I came to that realization, my mom and dad tried to talk me out of it because they didn't think there was any, uh, any future, you know, or long-term future anyway. We're often asked in school, what do you want to be when you grow up? And, uh... "Uh, I don't... Fireman?" Uh. all the while we were in contact with Jim Guercio. I first became involved with the fellas in Chicago in, uh, in college. SERAPHINE: Guercio really saw that there was no way for this to be successful unless there was total commitment. FITZGERALD: He had an idea of building a management company, and he called it his "creative community." LAMM: I think that his business tactics definitely had a hand in our creation, in our success. He envisioned everything sort of being under one roof. GUERCIO: And when the time was right we brought them to Los Angeles. [LIBERATION PLAYING] PARAZAIDER: The stars were aligned. We were supposed to do this. We were just meant to be. PANKOW: We all lived in a little house under the Hollywood Freeway. And our bedrooms were various rooms, my bedroom was the dining room. Each guy had a shelf in the medicine cabinet. Each guy had a shelf in the refrigerator. God forbid you take somebody's food. There were a lot of referees. PANKOW: Whoever had to take the last shower got the cold shower. [LAUGHS] So you, you drew straws every day you went to work. The home front. SERAPHINE: We went from clubs to we moved to LA, and more and more people, you know, starting to become aware of the band, and realizing that we were starting to become successful. [INTRODUCTION PLAYING] PARAZAIDER: My dad always told me, "Dream a big dream, if you shoot for the moon "and hit a star, it's cool." SERAPHINE: When you put it all on the line, there's a certain intensity and focus, and we had that. LOUGHNANE: We were, uh, very confident and, uh, energetic kids. We liked what we did, and we saw that other people liked what we did, but we didn't know if we were gonna have more than two records. PARAZAIDER: We were straight out of playing, you know, bars in Chicago. And we moved out to southern California, and here we ran into Janis Joplin at the Fillmore West. [PIECE OF MY HEART PLAYING] ♪ Oh, come on, come on, Come on, come on ♪ Didn't I make you feel ♪ Oh, honey, like you were the only man I ever wanted and I ever needed ♪ Oh ♪ PARAZAIDER: She came in with this big entourage and she dropped her brush right at my feet. And she went, "Hey, M-F-er, pick up the F-ing brush." And I says, "Pick up your own brush, "and when you get done with that, after you pick it up, "apologize to me that you talked to me that way." Well, she picked up the brush and she said, "I'm sorry." ♪ Take it! Take another little piece of my heart now, baby ♪ Oh, break it ♪ [LAUGHING] And that was the start of a thing where she hung with us and she showed us what she did to command on the stage. ♪ Oh, you know you got it If it makes you feel good ♪ Yes, indeed ♪ How she could really handle people. And we were on the tour, the last big tour on the west coast. That was the last tour that Big Brother and The Holding Company with Janis Joplin did. We saw their last show. FITZGERALD: We played every peace rally that ever happened in California, I think. And we didn't have any money. So, they started writing like crazy and we started doing anything we could to pay the rent. PARAZAIDER: We just happened to play the Whisky a Go Go and Jimmy had a camera and we took some pictures of Chicago Transit, of "CTA" on the marquee at the Whisky, which when I go by there I always think of Jimmy and I standing in the middle of Sunset Boulevard going... PANKOW: I remember we were, I think, opening for B.B. King, or something like that, um... Or Albert King. Walter turned around to walk out... He probably, he might have told you this story. I get a tap on my shoulder, and I turned around... I was putting one of my saxophones away. It was Jimi Hendrix. He called me by name and he said, "Walt, the horns are like one set of lungs. "Your guitar player's better than me." "The horn section, it sounds like one set of lungs, "and a guitar player that's better than me." He said that Terry plays better than him. [LAUGHING] First you have to realize we were already listening intensely to his music. You know, we looked up to him. Terry was already playing stuff that Hendrix had on his records. [FOXY LADY PLAYING] LOUGHNANE: Terry could play a rhythm guitar part, a lead guitar part, and sing a lead vocal simultaneously. I've never heard anybody that could do that. PARAZAIDER: And I gotta tell ya, I think in a couple weeks we were on the road with Hendrix. We got to see some of the stuff that was, uh, driving them, because Jimi wasn't happy with the licks he was playing. Do you have to practice every day, the way a violinist does? I mean if you're not working, say you're off in England, and you're just taking off a couple months, do you have to keep in shape every day? Yeah, well, I like to, like, play to myself, in like, in a room or before we go on stage or something like this, or whenever I feel like, whenever I feel like down or depressed or whatever, you know. You know, stuff that happens to every musician, and, you know, especially guys who are in the limelight and are put on pedestals. And, you know, they have that pressure of having to do something new all the time. PARAZAIDER: We were on a plane and I said, "Why are you so unhappy about what you're doing?" And he says, "Well, you're gonna know this one day, and you're gonna probably know it more than me. You're gonna be real successful, you're gonna have to spit out hits, you're gonna have to work real hard. You know, that's really not what I'm into." I says, "I'd love to have your problems!" You know? And he said, "Well, you will have them." [I'M A MAN PLAYING] MAN: Yeah, Pete! Yeah! Whoo! FITZGERALD: We went to New York to make a deal and to get them signed at Columbia Records. I first heard about Chicago from David Geffen and he said, "I keep hearing about a group that Jimmy Guercio has been working with called Chicago Transit Authority." ♪ My daddy sent a message About the whiskers on my chin ♪ Never had no problems 'Cause I've always paid the rent ♪ I got no time for lovin' 'Cause my time is all used up ♪ Spend my time creatin' All the groovy kinds of love ♪ I'm a man ♪ Yes I am and I can't help but love you so ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ Jimmy Guercio, we had given him a right of first refusal deal, so that he really could not sign an artist to another label until he gave us the right of first refusal. I signed them, and was very happy. ♪ I'm a man ♪ Yes I am And I can't help but love you so ♪ LAMM: It was a four-sided album, almost an hour and a half of new music that we performed very well and with enthusiasm and a lot of joy. The material that they themselves created and wrote, they did it with their material, they did it combining jazz, pop, and rock in clearly a very, very, uh, special way. LAMM: My instinct is to always be different. And time, you know, the concept of time is really abstract. It can take you anywhere, you know, from the future, to history, to right now. But my own perception of myself based on how I think when I'm writing, I mean, to this day, is to try to do something I haven't done before. And I could take things much further, but I try to keep it in the context of, you know, what's listenable. [DOES ANYBODY REALLY KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS? PLAYING] PARAZAIDER: Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is? is the first thing we ever recorded as a band together. LAMM: That's right. Good memory, Walt. PARAZAIDER: That's the first thing we ever did. And it was sort of frightening, 'cause we all got in the same recording studio... And we sort of were in a sort of a circle, and, for myself, personally, and I think maybe Lee and Jimmy, we didn't want to look at each other, 'cause we were afraid if we looked at one of the other guys we were gonna make them make a mistake. ♪ As I was walking down the street one day ♪ LOUGHNANE: Once we got into the studio, we started thinking we might not be ready, because we had no idea that when this little microphone gets in front of you, it hears everything. PARAZAIDER: This is gonna be forever. [VOCALIZING] You go... ♪ Does anybody really know what time it is? ♪ LAMM: I was kind of doing the Beatles. You know, I can sing in many styles, but my style, at least when I was rendering that song, was not to sing it like John Lennon, but was just to sing it straight. ♪ I was walking down the street one day ♪ A pretty lady looked at me And said her diamond ♪ SERAPHINE: You know, in those days it was a 16-track. Producers really did their work in those days. They were really, they made decisions on the spot. Peter's bass and my kick drum were on the same track. I mean, I never knew that. [BEGINNINGS PLAYING] ♪ Whoa ♪ LAMM: I wrote Beginnings based on scribbled notes I had, that I had been carrying around forever. I just loved the idea of strumming 16th note figures and kind of a really present vocal. ♪ When I kiss you ♪ I feel a thousand different feelings ♪ Right away the song had some kind of resonance and some kind of appeal. You know, because basically songs need to be memorable. So I showed Terry what I was doing on guitar. And he... It was a piece of cake for him. LAMM: We were all still very young. Were all still very wide-eyed and without experience. PARAZAIDER: Jimmy always said, "I always believed that we would do what we would do." And when the first album hit the charts at, I think, 42 or something like that with a bullet, or whatever, I went, "That's cool." And then all of a sudden, we realized we were more of an album act and they weren't getting what horns were. You know, people would come up to the horns and go, "Well, how do you, where's the strings? How do you tune it with the strings?" I said, "There aren't strings on a saxophone, there are reeds." You know, they really didn't know about horns. It was really the start, inception of horn bands. PANKOW: Walt was the eternal optimist. We were on our way to a gig and I don't know somehow I associated... "Uh, hey Walt, do you think I'll ever have a cashmere suit?" You know, cashmere suit? I still don't have a cashmere suit. I don't know what I associated that with. And Walt just looked at me, "Are you kidding? You'll have 200 of 'em!" This was a concept that he totally believed in and had no doubt that it was gonna, you know, it was gonna develop into something significant. I will say one thing that I got that I remember, and I remember Jimmy told me and I forgot this. We were in Indianapolis with Hendrix and 20,000 people there, and they're yelling, "Bring on Hendrix, bring on Hendrix!" I got so fed up, I got on the mic and said, "Shut the bleep up, and listen!" [LISTEN PLAYING] ♪ Listen ♪ PANKOW: AM radio was still a baby. Uh... You know, it was top 40, but it was bubblegum stuff. They weren't ready for what we were doing. FM radio was commercial-free in those days, and played whole albums. LOUGHNANE: And AM radio still hadn't played one of our songs. We released Beginnings, we released Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is? and they wouldn't play it 'cause they said we hadn't had a hit. You know, catch-22. How the hell are you gonna have a hit if you don't play something? There was a certain amount of frustration because of the singles that had been released and weren't successful. Besides the fact of we were doing a fair amount of drugs and partying and being young musicians on the road. And young musicians will burn the candle. LAMM: The zeitgeist of that era was that people our age were noticing that we felt different about things. And we sort of felt that we ought to try to do something about it. ♪ Can't stand it no more ♪ The people cheating Burning each other ♪ They know it ain't right ♪ How can it be right? ♪ Better end soon my friend ♪ LAMM: We're watching the war in Vietnam on television, we're watching the marches in the south for voter registration. We're watching all this stuff and we're reading about it and we feel like, you know, we need to have our voices heard. PANKOW: So it gave our music a political flavor and, uh, college students grabbed this because... "Man, these guys are spreading the word, you know? These guys are hip, they're with us, you know?" And we became kind of the required listening, you know, on college campuses. If you were "hip", you had to listen to Chicago Transit Authority, because these guys know the score. And, uh, next thing you know, "Let's stand up," you know, "to the powers that be." You know, "Let's riot in the streets, let's tear the system down." But we didn't want to go that route. We're not politicians, we're musicians. ♪ We know it's hard for you to see ♪ That this is all we want to be ♪ SERAPHINE: There wasn't time to really think about too much. We were on the road 250 days, I think, we had all we could do just to keep our sanity. We would come home for a day and leave for three months. [LAUGHING] And be out there working every night. LAMM: We were working so intensely, we were traveling so intensely. We were learning and rehearsing the songs of the second album while we were on tour promoting the first album. LOUGHNANE: When the second album came out, Jimmy had written Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon and AM radio said that they were interested in Make Me Smile. PANKOW: And I'm in the car and I hear this... [VOCALIZING REPRISE TO MAKE ME SMILE] I'm going "Whoa! "Hey, that's the Ballet!" And I was going... I'm in the car going, "Hey! "Hey! This is me on the radio!" And, I mean, you know, I'm embarrassed to say it, but when the disc jockey came on and said, "Here's a new song by an up-and-coming group "called Chicago that's destined for number one!" or something like that and...

You know? They're gonna play the Ballet on the radio! Boy, how can they play something that long?" At that time AM radio, the jungle warfare of music. [FINGERS SNAPPING] AM radio, you know... DAVIS: I think if you had a cut longer than three and a half minutes you would not really get it on top 40 radio. PANKOW: They took the end of the Ballet, which was the reprise of Make Me Smile, and spliced it onto the first movement which was the beginning of Make Me Smile and made it a whole song by itself. DAVIS: Fortunately, the issue was resolved because the album would have the longer, original version on there. [guitar music playing] I would be reconstructing actual history if I tried to ascertain whether or not the group was reluctant to be in the spotlight. They were performing artists from the very get-go. Their material was very strong. LAMM: Other than experiencing the joy of playing music, I didn't really think of anything in terms of success or longevity or... That was way, way down the road. ♪ So hard to be ♪ Free to love only you ♪ People staring at me ♪ Try to take you away ♪ There's not time to delay ♪ We've got to live for today ♪ PANKOW: The Ballet was not an easy piece to perform live. ♪ There is so much to say ♪ PANKOW: Because there are time changes, there are key changes, a lot of different intricacies that had to be fit together like a puzzle. This guy's singing that, this guy's singing this. SERAPHINE: And we were playing with these world-class singers, players and writers. And Lee, the same thing, Lee was a really serious musician. But also, he had real, he had a real identity problem in those days. I mean, it was real tough. LOUGHNANE: I never had confidence in myself. I was always like, "I'm not good enough, I don't know." You know, "I don't belong here." I was just afraid of people. Afraid of success, I guess. PANKOW: I wasn't writing a pop song. These movements in The Ballet were titled in the Latin for tempo or mood. It was just a series of classical moments sewn together, and Color My World was kind of a break. [COLOR MY WORLD PLAYING] PANKOW: Andante. ♪ That I've waited to share ♪ PANKOW: One thing that differs with my songs, when I wrote a song, not being a lead vocalist, it was a sing-off. ♪ Of our moments together ♪ PANKOW: I didn't have to have a sing-off on that. That was Ray Charles, that was Terry Kath. ♪ Color my world ♪ With hopes of loving you ♪ PARAZAIDER: I got a phone call, and it was Jimmy Pankow. He says, "You know, I got an idea for a movement of the Ballet." PANKOW: Okay, let's slow it down and get a little... Ah, let's get pretty. Simple. Brief. A little romantic interlude between Make Me Smile and Agitato. [VOCALIZING INSTRUMENTAL BREAK] Which was another, you know... Quizzically he looked at me out of the corner of his eye and he went... I said, "Well, what do you think?" I looked at him, and honestly I said, "It'll make me famous!" SERAPHINE: What a player, and an arranger, you know, it was really great to have a guy that great in your band. PANKOW: I had that gift, but you have to learn the instrument well enough to reproduce that tape that's going on in your head. LAMM: Beside the brass arrangements, his sense of melody, his expression in his playing his horn. It's just, it's just uncanny. Make Me Smile was actually titled "vivace". It's the first movement and then it reprises at the end. ♪ Now I need you, yeah ♪ More than ever ♪ PARAZAIDER: Lennon, they said "How would you like to be remembered?"

It was about art, and it was about making our music. I think it was more of a brand in those days, the logo. LOUGHNANE: It is a brand. Not more or less. It just is. You know, like Coca-Cola's a brand. PARAZAIDER: I never really thought about us being thought of as a product, but if you think about the logo, I really always just thought it was, you know, if they saw Chicago, they knew the band. GUERCIO: I think the pop music business is a business that happens to sell art occasionally. But it is certainly not a business where everything, all of the product is art. I think it is a corrupt business, I think it is archaic and antiquated, and is probably the most exceptionally dishonest industry. I mean, maybe. I mean, I haven't been involved in munitions or anything, but I know that the record business is quite dishonest because of the nature of the investment. You see, a very small investment of a few hundred dollars or a few thousand dollars can return hundreds of thousands of times its initial investment. PARAZAIDER: Becoming famous, whatever that is, and I still don't know, you know... I get inklings of it and everything, is something that was not... Personally... You'll probably get a different answer from every one of the originals... It scared me. And I think it scared us to a point that we could have gone one of two ways. Somebody could have gone, "Ah, I don't need these guys. I'm gonna do my own stuff." Or this... And, you know... Or just go, "Let's just... We've taken care of ourselves this far, we got through it with club owners, we lost gigs 'cause of playing our own material 'cause we believed in it, let's just hang together and forget all this outside stuff." And that's what we did. DAVIS: The success with Chicago was truly phenomenal. [25 OR 6 TO 4 PLAYING] Make Me Smile and Color My World, and 25 Or 6 To 4. LAMM: We only knew sold out arenas. So we only knew success. We didn't know... We didn't know failure, and we didn't know struggle. We were so busy that we didn't have time to sit down and say, [SIGHS] "We've done it!" And in the meantime we were drinking. You know, I was drinking all the time, so... "Why not? Let's do that!" You know. Dumb kids thinking, you know, we're indestructible. You know, live forever.

GUERCIO: They might not be the most perceptive human beings, in terms of what they see and how they see it. But they do experience more of the common denominator of this country, and of every country, because of travel. Just because of the nature of travel. Let's put it this way, this is before we recorded an album, and we went to New York and we used to go out, 'cause everyone wanted to, you know, meet some chicks, you know, have a nice little drink and all this stuff, so, like, we'd go into these nightclubs or something, you know, and, like, all these groupie chicks, you know, they'd come up, "Oh, you got long hair, who are you? Oh, yeah, I'm with CTA." [SNORTS] They'd split, you wouldn't even see them for the rest of the night. And now, you know, now we're the CTA, we have an album out, now it's a different story, ya know?

I wanted to be free creatively from any from any technical constraints. FITZGERALD: He envisioned having a place somewhere where you could not be bothered by the outside world. It was a great concept, actually. I think that was the devil's playground, myself. LOUGHNANE: Our original producer built a ranch with the money that we made him. GUERCIO: We had huge success with Chicago, I built the studio. It's the process I wanted, it's how I wanted people to conform to my environment and not theirs. ♪ I do believe in you ♪ And I know you believe in me ♪ Oh yeah ♪ Oh yeah ♪ LAMM: I think that he was hoping in creating a place where we could go and create that it would become sort of a cottage industry. GUERCIO: There was a lot of resistance. I mean, even... A lot of the guys in Chicago, "What are you, nuts?" LOUGHNANE: That was literally away from everything. That was like a town within itself. PARAZAIDER: I remember leaving the ranch because I needed to get some carbon monoxide. And you know, it was very cloistered in a way. And then I just would go to Boulder and then come back. I think that when you put young guys with too much money together in an isolated venue like Caribou Ranch, it's a recipe for disaster. And it was.

I was flying women up, Playboy Bunnies, and I was, you know... Had we been straight, it would have been so much better, but it was a lot of drugs. A lot. Whether it was pot, or speed, or coke, or acid, or whatever, it was all available, and it all could be delivered, and you could use it whenever and wherever you wanted to.

PANKOW: You go up to the mountains in Colorado and you immerse yourself in this creative process and the real world kind of fades away. My fiancee and I, we had a problem. I can't even remember what it was about. She wound up locking herself in a bathroom, and I was on the other side of the door, trying to... -[KNOCKS ON DOOR] -"Come out of the room," she was not cooperating. Finally, I went, "Enough of this." I went through the door and it freaked her out to the point where it freaked me out when I saw her. And I stopped in my tracks, and I asked myself, "What the hell are you doing, man?" [CHUCKLES] I stepped back and looked down the hallway, and saw my piano. Something moved me to go to the piano. I had a tape recorder sitting on the piano. I pressed record, sat down, and this song just came out. Just You 'N' Me began to come out of my fingers, pretty much in its entirety. I don't know what power came over me, 'cause it's never happened before or since, where I sat at a piano and a complete song happened. I turned the machine off and I sat there in amazement, wondering what had just happened. And I took this tape recorder to the bathroom where she was still sitting on the edge of the tub upset, and I played this song. [JUST YOU 'N' ME PLAYING] It erased all the acrimony. The song just bathed it away and everything was fine. ♪ You are my love in my life ♪ And you are my inspiration ♪ PANKOW: I took this tape up to Caribou Ranch to see if the guys are into it.

We sort of rediscovered ourselves here. It's definitely like, it's like a monastery when you're up here. Uh, the only reason you're here... [ALL PROTESTING] All right, let me rephrase that. It's a creative monastery. LOUGHNANE: More and more songs were being played on the radio and becoming hits. We were just working constantly.

Lead us Danny, eight to the bar! LAMM: We didn't really have a down trend that was... That was perceived, but there was one... There was one occurring. -And we were beginning to pay the price. -[ALL COUNTING DOWN] SERAPHINE: Management would never hold back on reminding us that, "Well, this could be your last hit." ALL: Twelve, eleven, ten, nine... SERAPHINE: You never know when it's gonna end. ALL: Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! [CROWD CHEERING] We are the epitome of a band. I mean... It has always been a team effort. When... When it starts getting weird, or... Somebody always steps up to take whatever slack is going on in the career. They step up and add a little more to it and we survive it somehow. LAMM: Cetera kind of felt less than because he wasn't a songwriter, and he wasn't really an instrumentalist. He played great bass and he was a great singer. But he felt really insecure about presenting his songs. Here are three members from Chicago. There's Terry, and there's Peter, and there's Danny. Welcome to the UK. Can I start off with you, Terry? Where did you get the song from? Well, you gotta start with him, 'cause he wrote this song. Well, I wanted you to say that so I could get to him, you see. Sure. Good man. -Peter... -Well, actually, you should... No, I did write the song. Just from experience. EDMONDS: I mean, somebody wandered out of your life? Many times. I don't know, I just wrote it. I don't know. -Puttin' me on the spot like this. -No idea. LAMM: So, when Peter presented the ballad, it was like, of course! You know, we're... One of the things that Chicago was about was let's record and write whatever we want, including songs that not... Maybe not everybody in the band loves, but, hey, if you write a song, we're gonna do it. We're gonna do it the best we possibly can do it 'cause that's who we are. And because we know that that's not who we are. And we know that, as nice a song as it is, it's just not, you know, nobody's gonna like it. [IF YOU LEAVE ME NOW PLAYING] [LAUGHS] ♪ If you leave me now You'll take away The biggest part of me ♪ Ooh, no Baby, please don't go ♪ LOUGHNANE: The perception from radio or the public, or critics, is that we think a certain way. We think... They read something into what we're doing that may not exist. PARAZAIDER: "Okay, this band is this, this band is an R&amp;B band. Oh, Chicago. Now we see what they are. They're a ballad band." ♪ A love like ours Is love that's hard to find ♪ How could we Let it slip away? ♪ SERAPHINE: This is what you dream about. You know, it doesn't always come in the form you want it to, but we'd already had a ton of success with all different styles of music. We were able to pretty much do as we wanted. GUERCIO: The process was a little bifurcated. We used the band, but if you listen to If You Leave Me Now, it's just Bobby's on a Rhodes and Danny's playing the drums and everything else, Peter and I did. LAMM: Those of us who kind of were all about being in a rock band were kind of looking at each other sideways saying, you know, "What is this?" You know, "Why are we doing this?" GUERCIO: Those songs were not Chicago songs. Those songs were Peter's songs. LAMM: I think that the person who was most affected by it was probably Terry Kath. Because he did not want to go there. He did not want to go to ballad land. I know the height of his frustration occurred after we recorded Chicago VII and we went out on the road and we tried to play that album live. LOUGHNANE: Without playing the other hits. Without playing the other hits. It was great but the audiences really didn't... They weren't buying it. And I smoked a joint and I called Terry and I said, "Terry, you know what, man? I think when we go out on the road next, we should play every fucking hit we have. Just play every fucking hit and forget about, you know, trying to do the jazz stuff." He said, "Oh, man, you're a fucking hypocrite." [LAUGHS] Fucking hung it up. So that's, that's really where he was. He wanted to stretch out because that's, you know, that's where we started. That's who we... That's who we were. PANKOW: When you get caught up in success and everything, I mean, you're so preoccupied by the enormity of a career when it takes off like it did for us that you don't give enough thought to, well, what about the business of this? SERAPHINE: As far as the business, I really kept an eye on the business a lot more. Things were kind of inequitable. The first thing that kind of really resonated with me was here I was living in a 1,000 square foot rental house in Studio City and Jimmy's up on a ranch, 3,000 acre ranch. Danny was always trying to tell us that, you know, we need to take a look at the contracts, we need to do this. "Let's look at the contracts, we better start looking at the contracts." "Relax. Let them do that stuff, we'll do ours." SERAPHINE: So I finally got the band to listen, and we had the books audited. And lo and behold, I mean, the difference, the difference in money was staggering. He was taking 100 percent of the publishing. Millions of dollars had been going to the wrong place. Millions of dollars. It wasn't like anything was being stolen, because we signed these terrible contracts in the very beginning of our careers with Jimmy. I understood why he developed the company that way. That it was basically for everybody's protection. But he was a little smarter than everybody else. LOUGHNANE: Jimmy knew things about the business that we didn't know, and you would have thought that he would hip us to that. But he didn't really. We took it to task and renegotiated. And he had 51 percent, by himself, of our entire career. And we had, we had 49 percent split seven ways. So there's quite a difference, especially after Uncle Sam comes in and grabs half. PARAZAIDER: I think we went as far as we were gonna be able to go with him. But I just think the time was up with that relationship and we had to move on. FITZGERALD: I never took a penny from anybody and I don't think you could have found a team that was any more honest than the team that he had built. And in my opinion, he destroyed it.

That strain is just the prices that you pay. LOUGHNANE: Through the years we kept building stage sets. We came up with this street scene and we had the brilliant idea to put a phone booth on the stage. That was called the Snortatorium. LOUGHNANE: Once you went into the booth, no one could see you from the audience. You would just disappear. But we had cocaine inside of it, and we would go in and take a hit of cocaine. You know, we would go in there and snort. LOUGHNANE: It's completely insane. It's getting your heart going like a Maserati coming around the curves. ♪ Everybody sang the blues ♪ You just lay into it and hit that turn like, "Ahhh, I got it!" And you could die just like that. I was just coming home from a Laker game and I got a phone call from our manager. He did one of those "Are you sitting down" things, and he said "Terry's dead." [LAUGHS] [SOBBING] Obviously, it still hits me. Holy shit. MALE RADIO ANNOUNCER: 25 days into the new year, and the front line of the rock 'n' roll ranks have been depleted once again. The lead singer of Chicago, Terry Kath, is dead. What? I... I didn't believe what I heard. I just, I almost, I got up and I almost fell to my knees and the phone was ringing. And I don't know why... But I got the word that he had passed away. And that was, uh... One of the worst days of my life. Terry was, uh, getting ready to do a solo record, and had been rehearsing at the house of, uh, one of the fellas in our crew. SERAPHINE: He was at Don Johnson's house, our keyboard tech. He did drugs with Terry, and he partied with Terry a lot. PANKOW: Apparently he had been cleaning his gun, and this was a little automatic pistol. Donny Johnson kinda squawked at him about, "Hey man, you know, "it's the middle of the night, you haven't slept, don't clean your guns, don't mess around with your guns. Just go to bed." And Terry said, "Hey look, man. You know, I know what I'm doing." And apparently Terry took the clip out of the gun, and showed him that there was nothing in the clip. But apparently there was still a round chamber. Terry was just foolin' with a gun. And, uh, um, the gun went off. PANKOW: Boom! Died instantly. And, uh... It was really, really hard news. LOUGHNANE: I didn't believe it. And, uh... [BREATHING HEAVILY] I believed it... When I went to the wake and he was laid out in the casket. And the thing that really hit me was when I touched his... His shell. [SOBS] 'Cause that's what it is, that's what these are. It's a shell. When the humanity leaves, the soul leaves, it is a hollow... Body. This is the car we drive around in on this plane throughout this lifetime. This is not our essence. Our soul, our spiritual self is our essence, and when this body dies, that leaves. [GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING] SERAPHINE: We didn't do enough. We should have intervened. 'Cause that's what friends do, real friends do for one another. I think at the time, we didn't know how to handle that. How do you tell somebody not to do something that you might be doing? LAMM: I think I had sort of lost my way in every aspect of my life. The thing about Terry Kath is that the ferocious force and drive of his playing is what, is what informed this band. And when he was gone, it changed forever. LOUGHNANE: I still had dreams that I was sitting on my front steps at the house that I was raised in in Elmwood Park. And Terry came walking down the street like nothing had ever happened. "Holy shit, there's Terry!" He said, "Oh, yeah, it was an FBI thing. I had to go away and hide out, but I'm back. Let's, you know, go on." And, you know, I was going, "Terry, Jesus Christ, we replaced you already!"

PINNICK: My first day of rehearsing with them, I had to go down and hide in the pool house because nobody had told Donny that he was out of the band. We had auditioned, unbeknownst to Donnie. Donnie Dacus was late for rehearsal. We finally got a hold of him. "What? Bullshit! What do you mean?" Two words, buddy. You're fired.

And then... -Was it an omen... Well, that's what I thought. I thought of it as an omen. Thinking, well, something bad is coming upon us. SERAPHINE: And, you know, they bought us off the label. You know, they gave us a couple million dollars to leave the label. PARAZAIDER: So we decided to just take, you know, take some money and... And go on and find a producer and try to do... Do the best album we could possibly do. At that point, we were dysfunctional. We weren't writing great songs anymore and it was just a... The band had gone really stale. AZOFF: Look, any time a band's been, made, you know, as many records as they had made at Columbia, um, you know it can go stale. LOUGHNANE: Irving Azoff, he had a label called Full Moon. It was a part... It was a subsidiary of Warner Bros. AZOFF: I had moved my record label out of CBS at about the same time that Chicago became free. Irving was, you know, known to be this really great manager, you know, who fought for his artists. I think I went to them and said, "I'll give you the best of both worlds. "I'll give you Warner's, and I'll give you my undivided attention as a label head." Even in those days the two respected labels were Columbia and Warner's. So, you know, you wanted to be on one of those two. You know, so when I was starting the label I said, "I'm gonna sign Chicago." "Why do you want to sign Chicago?" You know, 'cause their sales had dwindled. Um, I always believed. I stood in the center of the room like this, and they were all around me. And they were about to play me the songs that they had written for Chicago 16. Each one was equally as average as the last. And so now after the 13 songs, they say, "Well, what do you think of the record?" And I said it. I said, "These songs suck." [CHAINS PLAYING] AZOFF: David Foster was a very sought-after, exciting, young, writer/producer, uh, who was really at the top of his game. FOSTER: I don't know what Jimmy Guercio's contribution was to those early albums, but I suspect that that sound that they had, he just had to harness the sound and, just, like, hang on for dear life. I don't think he was hands-on the way I was, you know, getting in there and playing and arranging and writing. The very first day, of the very first session, I pressed the talk pad, I go, "Uh, Peter, you know when you get to the bridge, uh, you played a wrong note there. It's an F not an E." Or whatever. Oh... He took me to the vocal booth when there was nobody in there and he said, "You know, I don't want you to ever out me in front of the band. And furthermore, I don't even want to play bass anymore. You're gonna play the bass." ♪ Chains are the temporary ♪ FOSTER: Peter was unhappy in the group. And then the double-whammy was that we just clicked and it was just fortunate and unfortunate all at the same time, but we became a power couple within the group. AZOFF: Hard To Say I'm Sorry, which was the big first hit emerges from a movie soundtrack called Summer Lovers. Everything fell in place. FOSTER: We all went to the premiere. Peter and I are sitting next to each other. We've written the song. He's singing it. We're so excited. The end title comes on. It starts out, you can hear it really nice... [PLAYING SONG INTRO] We're getting excited, like, this is our moment man, and it's just filling the speakers. Way in the background of the movie is a motorcycle. It's getting louder and louder, and the song is getting softer and softer. And it's like, "Dude, are you kidding?

But it didn't do some of us any good because he wouldn't use us on the records. LOUGHNANE: And because Peter was part of the writing team, he had more of a say in what was gonna go on there. The songs that we had written... Eh, not so much. LAMM: I had submitted a few songs to David Foster, and they weren't really even songs, they were just sort of song ideas, and I think maybe one of them got saved, uh, and...

LAMM: Well, you know, my ego was crushed. You know, in my mind I was writing the really good songs. He said, "Well, to me, man, Chicago is Peter Cetera's voice and the three horns."

[HARD TO SAY I'M SORRY PLAYING] Hi, I'm Tammy, and I'm listening to one of Chicago's very popular songs, called Hard To Say I'm Sorry. The first time I heard Chicago was when I was 13, but Chicago has been a very popular group since I was five years old. Uh, what makes your group so together? You seem to have such a family-orientated group. We actually grew up together in this business. I mean from being kids, you know, to the point where we are right now, and we've experienced all of the success and, uh, the good things and a lot of hardships, and we've struggled through all of them together. And, uh, we like each other. AZOFF: I left and went to run Universal in 1983. To my recollection they continued to record with Warner's for many, many years. From the, uh, Peter Schivarelli, uh, side of things. SCHIVARELLI: You know, it's easy to take care of Jimmy Buffet or Stevie Nicks, you talk to one person. With Chicago it's a kind of a committee. [WE CAN STOP THE HURTIN' PLAYING] ♪ There's people sleeping on the ground ♪ I always used to say that they used to have a meeting about having a meeting. SERAPHINE: Some of the problems was we'd have band meetings and everything was done democratically. PANKOW: Peter showed up at the meeting and made ultimatums. Peter wanted a double share and... We knew that he did not want to go on the road. I like my own bus, and I want, I want more. We said okay, well, you know, we'll give you more control, if you want that, if that's gonna do something. I'd have to say that Peter, to be very honest, was not a fan of the horns. [YOU'RE THE INSPIRATION PLAYING] ♪ You know our love Was meant to be ♪ The kind of love That lasts forever ♪ LAMM: You know, Peter felt that there didn't need to be brass on every single song and I happened to agree. PARAZAIDER: I just can't say that they were the integral part of what the music was up to that point. The horn players would come in, you know, and they'd hear the vocals and they'd literally walk over to the board and they'd go, "Turn those vocals down!" And, like, they'd just grab the faders and there'd be no vocals. And then we'd put it back. And then Peter would come in and go, "Turn those horns down!" ♪ You're the meaning In my life ♪ LOUGHNANE: To concentrate on the vocals, he would actually stop playing the bass. There would be no bottom. So that's when I started playing the Moog bass. PARAZAIDER: I picked up a guitar, Jimmy played keyboards, and we just wanted to be part of the songs. It came to a point that we thought, "Geez, maybe we, maybe it's not going to be a horn band anymore." ♪ Then along comes a woman ♪ There's a change In the way ♪ PANKOW: Peter and David had a string of big hits. They had a, uh, relationship that worked. FOSTER: My records were good. I mean I, I was, like, hitting my stride and a writer and as a producer and as a player. And I begged them, I said, "Guys, this is a hit, I promise you this is a hit record. You've got to cut this song. "No, we're not interested. We don't like it. We don't wanna do it. We didn't write it. We don't wanna do it." FOSTER: To appease them I used all three of them to get them at least interested to do the demo. ♪ I guess I thought ♪ You'd be here forever ♪ I guess I thought ♪ You'd be here forever ♪ FOSTER: I think I gave them a lot of success, but I think I softened their sound, um, past the point of where I should have. ♪ You don't know what ya got ♪ Until it's gone ♪ PARAZAIDER: The difference from the inception of the group was much different. One thing you don't want to do is try to keep somebody in the band that doesn't want to be there. ♪ I was acting as if you Were lucky to have me ♪ Doin' you a favor ♪ I hardly knew you were there ♪ But then you were gone ♪ And it was all wrong ♪ Had no idea how Much I cared ♪ CETERA: I didn't really leave Chicago, they sort of forced me, sort of forced my hand at that point. I just wanted to do a solo album. Like a lot of guys who are in groups do a solo album, and then you do a group solo with the... And they didn't want me to do that. Uh, we were very successful, and then we went downhill, and then I kind of brought us back up again, and, uh, and now it was, uh... Wow. How long before you knew you'd made the right choice? PINNICK: When Peter left, it gave them the opportunity to, kind of, you know, reform the way they want to. You know, they had the manager call up and say... I think I can almost quote his words, "We're not sure how the band's going to be structured next year." [CHUCKLES] So, you know, what I, I mean, to me that says, "You're fired." [THUNDER RUMBLING] JASON SCHEFF: At the time I connected with these guys I was just playing a lot of top 40 music in top 40 bands and that was really as far as my aspirations went. I was just looking at it as, let me just play and sing these songs like a great top 40 gig. ♪ Waiting for The break of day ♪ We'd had success with Foster, but we needed to... Obviously, Peter was gone now, so we needed a departure. SCHIVARELLI: You know, it was kind of like a team losing a good player, but Robert, and Lee, and Walt, and Jimmy, they just picked right up and just, you know, moved forward. It's not gonna stay the same. It's gonna... It's got to be different, it's got to go somewhere. And we did all the power ballads, we got shit for doing the power ballads, too. There's, you know, "They've sold out," you know, "They don't take chances anymore." I don't care what they think. ♪ Sitting cross-legged On the floor ♪ 25 or 6 to 4 You're redoing one of the classic songs, and that's like, you know, "Why put me in that position?" Again, I was just going, "Awesome!" I don't hide the fact that I tried to get him to sing like Peter on the record. ♪ Staring blindly into space ♪ LAMM: There were, and are, a lot of tenor voices in rock, and none of them sound like Cetera. In my mind, I'm the one that brought Jason into the band. Now, you're gonna get, like, ten different perspectives about who called him and who put him in the band. Foster wanted him out of the band. He didn't like his voice at all. I fought with David, and I fought for Jason, and I said, "No, you give him a chance." I absolutely, 100 percent never wanted Jason out of the band. I wanted him in the band, and in my recollection, he was my pick and I brought him to the guys. That's what I recall. Is that solid enough? I can't believe that Danny would say that I didn't want Jason in the band. I mean, it's just ludicrous. ♪ Take me as I am ♪ Put your hand in mine ♪ SCHEFF: Coming into something that had been together for so long with, this is a family, this is awesome, this is us, and everything, but, I was with a group full of guys who were mentors, that had been through a lot and I'm looking at that going, "This is what they did to come out the other end of it. This is what I'm doing, and it's cyclical." You just do your best work and just don't self-destruct. And it all comes back around. The road is narrowing. If you just stay and survive, there aren't really gonna be many left. [HORNS PLAYING] I was working with David Foster at a time when David, for whatever reason, felt he wasn't getting what he wanted from Danny. SERAPHINE: My friend Hawk Wolinsky calls me and he said, "Hey what the fuck is David, is Jeff Porcaro, playing on a Chicago record?" And I went, "What?" David Foster wanted to have somebody who could play better with a click, because it was the era of the click. He'd kind of lost his confidence and I had this sound that I wanted that he couldn't get. I don't know. All I know is that he did that behind Danny's back and Danny got very, very upset about it. In fact, he... He threatened him. FOSTER: Their manager called me and said... "You better get out of there right now." I said, "Why?" "'Cause Danny Seraphine just found out, "and he's coming down to the studio and and he has a gun." SERAPHINE: First of all I wanted to kill him. I, you know, I almost did. I said, "What the fuck is... What's going on?" They said, "Well, we wanted to try out Simmons. "They had the electronic drums and Jeff had a set, so we wanted to hear them." [STAMMERS] I think it was bullshit. When technology started improving, or at least growing or inventing new stuff, musicians had to learn how to use them. All of a sudden being thrown on a click, and I could see them talking about me in the control room, and I could feel everybody talking about me, and it was... I could feel the undercurrent of doubt. Oh, it just fucked me up. KATH: The function of a drummer is to actually keep time. Nothing else. Danny is a drummer. I would consider him a lead drummer, not a rhythm drummer. He plays solos constantly, through all songs, in my estimation. LOUGHNANE: I really don't want to have to figure out where "one" is. And, and that's the musician talking. Changing the time without everybody else knowing where it's gonna go, the rest of the guys in the band shouldn't have to figure that out. Danny's lack of accurate drumming and accurate time-keeping was, was really a detriment to the band in live performance. PANKOW: We went to England, finally, again, uh, we hadn't had a career in England for a long time because Terry, uh, insulted the country on the world tour in '77. And here we are in London. Ah, I, you know, I took my wife with me. She had never been to Europe. PANKOW: She got him out of the sack at like 7:00 in the morning. They rented a car, Danny's driving himself. We went sightseeing. Seeing castles and whatnot. I should have rested, so I was jet-lagged. PANKOW: Here it is 12 hours later, we're leaving for a show, and this man... I played... We played a show and I... I really did play horribly. I mean it was... It was... Uh, it was terrible. -[HUMMING] -[SNAPPING FINGERS] After the show we had a meeting. "Hey, Danny, you got to stop looking at castles. Dude, come on, what's going on here, man? You lost it here." LAMM: In the '70s he really broke a lot of new ground. When he was really good he was very good. In my view, he spent too much time focusing on things other than music. And, you know, really sort of being on top of it. SCHIVARELLI: His mentality was Buddy Rich, Mick Fleetwood, that he should control the band, and I think it kind of wore thin after a while. SERAPHINE: There was probably some truth to that. We had good management at that point. I really didn't need to be the drummer/manager anymore, leading the band out of the darkness, so to speak. LOUGHNANE: When we're playing, we're not worrying about business. That's a separate thing. That has its compartment. I really just think business really became more important than playing. LOUGHNANE: You don't do business, like, just before the show or during the show, and, you know, worrying about the deal, you play the fucking song. PANKOW: At shows he, he started having his mixing boards next to his drums. And he'd be playing, and while he was playing, he was mixing. LOUGHNANE: It takes two hands and two legs to play the drums. If you take one of them off, you start missing stuff. "Dude, what are you doing?" LAMM: That was when the founding members got together with Danny and asked him to take some time and get it, get it together. SCHEFF: You know, you just need to work, focus back on your playing and become Danny again. SERAPHINE: "Well, what are you talking about? I just played on everything we just did, and it was a huge success." ♪ If you see me walking by And the tears are in my eyes ♪ Look away, baby, look away ♪ And If we meet on the Street someday ♪ And I don't know What to say ♪ SERAPHINE: And at one point Jason said to me, and I wanted to slap him, "We felt that the band, that the album was successful in spite of your playing." And I went... [SCOFFS] SCHEFF: Hey, listen, I think it's important to actually really ask yourself, "Is there validity to this?" You know it, it... I mean, there was truth to all of that to a certain degree. I could kind of see it and I thought, "If these guys are all saying it, they must be right." That's a viewpoint and a perspective by the collective group and it's a message. I said, "Okay, I'll go back and I'll, I'll woodshed." You know, have a long meeting with myself about my playing and work on it. Work on with a click and work on this and that. And so I went and, and I got with a teacher, woodshedded like crazy for six weeks and... LAMM: When Danny came back from, sort of, woodshedding and us having to work with another drummer, it was really no change. And when we tried to make him aware of it, he didn't agree. So one thing led to another, and he ended up being out rather than in. SERAPHINE: And as much as I kind of knew it was coming, it was a... It just knocked me to my knees. And, you know, it was, uh, I lived and ate and drank and pissed, bled, cried, lived, died that band. You know... LAMM: You know, I'm just speculating, but I think that Danny felt that he was a founding member of the band, and we were going to have to take him, you know, regardless of how we felt about his playing. Uh, I, I just felt that if he was gonna stay in the band, it would tear the band apart, so he had to go. SERAPHINE: I think the loss of friendship was probably what I, what hurt me more than anything. Because, you know, all of a sudden, you know, I went from having seven... Six or seven other, like, brothers, to nothing. LOUGHNANE: We would have never gotten rid of anybody. That's not the way it works. The Beatles didn't get rid of anybody, you know. How could it be the Beatles if somebody leaves? Come on! That was the last thing we wanted to do. But it became impossible to work and function properly as a band. SCHIVARELLI: Those six guys in that room... That... That stayed together and was special for such a long time. Longer than the shelf lives of all the one-hit wonders, and somewhere in between, that glitch happened. And I'm really sorry for it. People are always gonna know me for as the drummer of Chicago. I mean it's even... It's ironic. I mean, they still bill me as "Chicago's Danny Seraphine." LAMM: Once Danny was gone and Tris came in, I think all of us thought, "Hey, we better... We better all, you know, shape up." IMBODEN: They really made me feel at home. They also said "You don't have to do what Danny did." PARAZAIDER: It sort of sounds like, with all due respect to Danny, like he's always been there. LOUGHNANE: Since Tris has joined the band... I talked about never having to worry about where "one" is... I've never had to worry about where "one" is. IMBODEN: No matter what the time period, the songwriting has just been stellar, through five decades, right? What's the line about a writer writes, always I think a musician plays, performs always. And I think that's what we do, that's what this band is about. We'll be in there somewhere in the index, under "C", Chicago. Hopefully. IMBODEN: Those guys, man, all of them. Just have this uncanny ability, and do reinvent themselves. And what they hear, and what their, what their muse tells them, or whatever, you know. PANKOW: You know, we're not on magazine covers. You know, we're not the flavor of the month. It's the tortoise and the hare. The hare's gonna win the race, and it's, "Oh, man!" Wow! And in the fable the tortoise wins the race. 'Cause the tortoise is focused only on the task at hand. Which is the music. Whoo! SCHEFF: We were gonna cut our auditions off one day early, and I said, "I really believe it's worth a listen to stick around and hear this one guy." PANKOW: He was playing the rhythm things that Terry had. He had that feel. "Yeah," he goes, "You were the only guy that went..." [MIMICS RHYTHM GUITAR] [PLAYING GUITAR] PANKOW: Anybody close enough to Terry... "You're hired man." The work ethic in the band is, I think, incredible. We'll out-practice anybody. HOWLAND: Chicago feels like a band to me. One unit working together, you know, like, much like a team. [CROWD CHEERING] SCHIVARELLI: I think everyone genuinely cares about each other. We spend more time with each other than we do with anybody else. I think that's just a thing that's kind of grown, uh, over the years. LAMM: The brain works perhaps more efficiently with facts. [STAMMERS] With bullet points. Obviously it's a very different experience to have lived through history. To me it's been all one very long sweep. SCHEFF: I couldn't foresee anything, as far as anybody leaving. With anybody who's come and gone in this band. It's funny, because people will find what their cumulative value is. PANKOW: Bill Champlin, "Ah, well, the only reason "people come here to see the band is 'cause of me." "Oh, really? Hmm. Okay." Bye. Next! And then the band grew. And styles changed. At a certain point if you've played on some hit records, people have heard you. And if you played well or played something interesting, they remember you. Then they call you. One of the most amazing singers I know, great keyboard player, Lou Pardini. [CROWD CHEERING] PANKOW: Even Lou became a natural part of what we've always been. PARDINI: I think it was a good fit for myself and for the band. I'm taking it at a... At a time where I've had a lot of experience under my belt. Being creative, making new music, going out and doing better shows. I think we've put together a show that's the best one we've ever had. LOUGHNANE: February 15, 2014 will be the beginning of the 48th year. PANKOW: Nobody has had successful years consecutively for 47 years. Nobody. Nobody! Nobody. [CROWD CHEERING] LOUGHNANE: I mean, who would have known that we could outlast businesses, banks, venues. You know, they build venues, we go play them, they tear the venue down, we go play the new one after they build it. I think the longest period that we weren't on the road was about three months. At the... At the very most, it would have been six. We are continuing with our success and it's at this level. To this day, I'm embarrassed to say I'm a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, although I've just been back there a couple years. I'm embarrassed to say that they're not. I think it's an injustice. I think that Chicago very strongly deserves, uh, to be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. You don't get into the Hall of Fame maybe until you're gone, then they're never getting in, 'cause they're never going away. We've always been kind of an afterthought. As far as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, by any criteria they belong in there. Longevity, number of hits, number of shows, number of records sold. If it comes, it'll come. FEMALE ANNOUNCER: The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has announced its 2016 inductees. Cheap Trick, Steve Miller, Deep Purple, N.W.A., and Chicago will be added to the Hall of Fame on April eighth, 2016. LOUGHNANE: The perception of being in, and actually being in is quite different. All of a sudden we have the keys to the club. We figured it was a matter of time. We're certainly, uh, qualified. This is an awesome historical moment for Chicago. It's surreal being included with so many other people. It's just terrific. Congratulations, you're in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. -Yeah! -Long overdue. -Good to see you... -Good to see you, man. MALE ANNOUNCER: The question that looms is, obviously Chicago is going to perform at the induction, and the question is, are you going to join them? CETERA: Well... I, uh... You know what? I am going to reserve any comment, um, on that until tomorrow on my website. LOUGHNANE: Cetera wasn't really with us in the initial band. There was only six of us. For him not to have participated in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction is his choice and no one else's. He's missing something that will never come back again. LAMM: It would have been nice if everybody could have been here, including Terry. As you say it's been a long, long, career. Things happen, when they happen, for a reason. [CROWD CHEERING] ROB THOMAS: In 1967, a group of musicians came together. And they were weaving their city's diverse musical influences into one bold, beautiful sound. It is my honor to finally induct Terry Kath, Peter Cetera, Danny Seraphine, Walter Parazaider, Lee Loughnane, James Pankow, and Robert Lamm, Chicago, into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. [CROWD CHEERING] [MUSIC PLAYING] PANKOW: It's a milestone. Thank you for finally inviting us into your house. For me, when you say, "Who are the greatest American bands?" you're gonna say the Eagles, the Beach Boys, Chicago. ♪ Saturday in the park ♪ I think it was The Fourth of July LAMM: This band started on February 15, 1967 when we played for the first time in my basement. [CHUCKLES] We never thought we'd be standing up here at this time. ♪ People dancing People laughing ♪ A man selling ice cream ♪ The band deserves to be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, they're finally in the Hall of Fame.

Yes, I can ♪ And I've been waiting such a long time ♪ LOUGHNANE: Life has many ups and downs, but I've been blessed with three things that have never failed me. Music, my trumpet, and, uh, the guys in this band. Walt, Danny, Lee, James, Terry... LAMM: Whenever I perform Saturday In The Park, there's a line that I sing about a man playing guitar, and I always give a quick look up to the heavens to say "Hi." ♪ A man playing guitar ♪ You know, I'm still working through losing Terry. SCHIVARELLI: My earliest recollections were, they were playing, and in those days they used to have to play six sets. They always, you know, worked hard, and like I say, uh, it's kind of ironic because nothing's changed. It was basically how they've started and they've continued on. They love to play. They love to perform. LAMM: I'd like to thank our manager, Peter Schivarelli, who's believed in us for well over 30 years. And I'm biased, because I'm from the neighborhood, in Chicago, 12th and Pulaski, and I have to say, you know, you're a great friend and you have a heart of gold. He has been our offense and defense. He's, uh, somehow found a way to keep us working for almost 50 years. We love you, Peter. LOUGHNANE: He's like an Energizer Bunny. He never needs batteries, though, he just keeps going, and going and going. SCHIVARELLI: You know, a lot of people bring up that they've been around for a long time. What's their secret? Even with the additions that had to be brought in due to departure or death, I think they're all guys that worked in harmony, not only good players, but good players who were easy to coexist with. LAMM: And lastly to the fans out there for making it happen for us, day after day, and year after year. We're not going anywhere, and you ain't seen nothing yet. Until the last couple of years I haven't really ever thought about... It would be nice to just, uh, sit. Or, it would be nice to not have to be somewhere in some lobby at 6:30, getting ready, getting on a bus and going to a gig. It would be nice to not have to play. Uh, and, you know, having said all that, uh, anybody who stops doing anything that they've done their entire life will eventually miss it. LOUGHNANE: Once we get off tour, you know, I don't know what our relationship will be, because we don't see each other. SCHIVARELLI: You don't know what it's gonna be like. You know? And it's... It's a little scary. It's something I've done since I'm nine years old and that will never go away. Logically, I don't expect, you know, if, you know, once it's over, um, I don't expect we would spend much time together. We've spend enough time together to last a lifetime. I will never stop thinking of my brothers as my brothers. We're closer than we are to some of our families. We, you know, we have separate families now. We are still, you know, brothers, and, uh... I don't know. LAMM: I feel, uh, the impetus of, of running out of time. That I'm finding to be very inspiring. I feel like I'm running out of time and I better get, I better get down. Yeah. The mortality is a reality. Well, we've been asked how long it could go for quite a long time, and... -Yeah. -Oh, yeah. It doesn't have to stop. But I don't want to fuck around. No. We're not fucking around. We ain't fucking around. SCHIVARELLI: If we're fucking around, we're kidding ourselves. [LAUGHING] Robert one time said he wants to be like Picasso, and Picasso fell over dead working on a sculpture at 96. And he said, "I want to be like Picasso and fall over dead on stage." And Lee said, "Yeah, we'll all fall over dead together." [CHUCKLES] ♪ We know it's hard for You to see ♪ That this is all We want to be You guys are a wonderful crowd.

They're not done. And the performance they gave at the Grammys was nothing short of terrific. BILL CLINTON: We're really blessed to have them. They're one of the handful of most important bands in the history of music since the dawn of the rock 'n' roll era. They've basically influenced everything I do as far as writing, you know, and performing, as well. They were truly a great band in, in the true sense of the word. I open up the second album and look at each individual guys, while I was listening to the song. "He's playing drums and he is the singer on this song." So I used to make, like, my images, you know. I got to be about a junior in high school and, a little cliche-ish, but it was really from the very beginning that I started to, to follow them. I remember when the second album came out, their messages were not just music, it wasn't just a rock 'n' roll band with horns. They're a rock 'n' roll band. And someone will say, "But they have horns." Yeah! HOWLAND: Jason's been here, for what, close to 30 years now, twenty-five years for Tris, almost 20 for me. A lot of people think that all it takes to be successful in the industry is to be a great player, but we're all trying to support each other and put out the best product, uh, if you will. Hot solo! PARDINI: The more that we do these songs, the more it becomes a part of me, and the more I become part of it. This little club that we're in is a moment right now that's happening, and if we're not paying attention to it, it's gonna go by and then people look back and just go, "Wow, the good old days." Well, these are the good old days. [ORCHESTRA PLAYING] JIMMY PARDO: I've been around on this planet almost as long as the band has, so I've... My entire life has been growing up with this band. As a kid in the '70s, they were kids as a rock band. In the '80s they found that, you know, that success again, I'm graduating high school. They disappear a little bit, Then, you know, they disappear a little bit, I'm confused in my life. As cliche as it sounds, Chicago literally is the soundtrack to my life. You're welcome! [CHUCKLES] You're welcome. IMBODEN: Music, at the best of times, you know, when you no longer exist, when you just watch yourself play this incredible stuff that you've never played before, and the realization that all we have is this moment right now. [ALL CHEERING]
