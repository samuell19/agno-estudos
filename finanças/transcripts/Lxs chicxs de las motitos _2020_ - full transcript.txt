The family –Is this homework? –No. –Who is that? –You. –Me? –Yes. –So small? –That´s the way I made it. Why we don't have feet? Because we are sitting and you can't see them, but they are there.

Your grandfather always spoiled you. My dad. He used to make you dance... sing... and then he would clap. Mom… I want my fifteen-birthday party. –Do you think you deserve a fifteen party? –Why not? Why no!? Do you mean why not? How many times you told me you were at Eni's house and you were with Lauti? Look at me, Juliana, where were you two going? Where you party on? Where you at Lautaro's house? –You'd better be taking precautions, Juliana. –Mom Don't shout at me. Don't treat me like a kid, if you let me do things, now deal with it.

Take it easy, honey No… his mother told me that she won't let him go out. –The police are going around like crazy. –Don't say that. Kids at the slum won't go to school.

It must be nice to have a girlfriend. Look at me, I'm black, poor and queer. Who is gonna love me? I mean it, dumb-ass. I can't talk to you. Motherfucker! –Hi. –Hi. Can you hold her for a second? Where is Lauti? –Did you check the house? –Yes. Why do you have that bag? I stayed at a friend's house. And now you are staying… waiting for him? I think so… for a while. Would you watch her a little? I'm going over there a little. Just a little while. –What if she cries? –She won't cry. –Did you argue with Lauti? –No. –With your mom? –Always –Dad... –What? Why did you marry mom? –We didn't get married. –I know. We were in love, above all that. That? Well, she got pregnant.

There with Lauti. Yes, I know. Well you know that Juli and Lauti have already… No, she doesn't tell me anything. Yes! –What's up? –I'm cold! Mom! –What is it? –I don't know. Mom! –Did you know? –What? –That they were mugging. –Everybody was. Why are you taking the kid? He didn't do anything. Poor woman. Bastards!! Why are you taking him!? Why are you taking him?! –How old is he? –Eighteen. He is going to be locked a couple of years. You are sure you weren't there, were you? Yes. This is unbelievable, isn't it? We are lucky the neighbors know us. These are two for 15. –Just a second. What is it? –I have to go. –Can you wait an hour? –No. Listen to me! You eat from this too. Where are you going? That little bitch has you in the palm of her hand. I have to see her. I have to see her… just a minute. It's a lot of money. I know. But the pills are much cheaper. Yes, but I could die. –What are you two doing? –Nothing You won't die. Casco, my mom is still waiting for you. What if I tell it to my uncle? I don't know. Maybe he went through this. Everybody went through this. This is so common. Are you sure that you want this? Yes. Think about your birthday party. I won't have it anyway. Wait here. She gives me a sideways look. She doesn't want to smoke. Take it, Lauti… don't bother her! I'm fucked up, boy. Everything is wrong… My mother is sick. I don't know! What is it? The same shit. She cannot move. That. Hi, Ma.

In the evening I watch myself on the news at eight. There I was. You? On the tele! What did you say? Nothing. Juli's uncle. –So… What did he say? –The politics stuff he says. Stop it! Why the tele was here? Because of the boy crossing the street, the one they took to prison. Yes... –You have your exam tomorrow. –Yes, I know. You better know. –Juli! –Uncle! –Oi, Is your mom at home? –She is inside. –Casco is back, did you see him? –No, I didn't. –Was he in the lootings? –No, no. Well, that's good.

Can you use a glass, Juli? –Is Casco going back to school? –Yes, he told me so. He was in a mess, that asshole. I told him that you were expecting him.
