(Amaya): Come on, Chiquita. There's water for everyone. - Slowpokes! - (Laughter) Yeah! We made it! To the water! I won! (Itzel): You're all slower than a turtle! - Wow! So cool. - (Laughter) (Slurps) (Gulps) Ahhh, that really hits the spot, you know? More like every spot. Huh? Ha ha! Check it out! - Eww! - Eww, that's kinda gross! (Chima): You know what would make Pako look better? - Not seeing him at all! - (Laughter) Kids! What have we learned about judging each other by our differences, hmm? - What would your parents say? - Hmm? Hah! Live loud and proud, baby! That's what my mama would say. Yuck! Gross! I can see the bug it just ate. - Eww, his belly looks weird. - Let's see. Hmm. Pako... most definitely here. (Chuckles) Manu, Igu. Ohh. Itzel, Camilla. Chima, Mati. Oh? Nachi? Ahh. Where is he this time?! Nachi goes for the fruit. And the crowd goes wild! He uses his super tail! Unexpectedly goes through and breaks into space. Now, nose makes a push and run. Then back to the tail. It's a perfect combination play! Huh! What a playmaker! - Aaahh! Huh? - (Xochi screams) Ay, ay! Oww! Oww! (Groans) Oww! Hey! Watch where you're going! It's not my fault. That guava flew right into me! It wasn't flying. I was holding it! Apology accepted. - I didn't apologise! - Mm-hm! What kind of animal are you, anyway? Koati. Only the most feared beast in the jungle. Hmm. - Oooh! - Hmm? My wings are trembling. You got a name? Nachi. Mine is Xochi. I'm a monarch butterfly. Maybe you've heard of us? We migrate thousands of miles using our incredible navigation skills. - What are you doing here? - I got lost. Hardware malfunction. (Gasps) Oh. So... this is where you live, huh? - Whoa! Don't go in there. - Show me, show me, show me! I get it, I get it. Embarrassed by your family. I got about 300 brothers that drive me crazy. And one sister who can't fly over a puddle without looking at herself. Well, I live alone. Where's your family? Don't have one. Do what I want, whenever I want. I'm fine on my own. (Giggles) O-K, whatever you say. By the way, while you were doing what you wanted, whenever you wanted, did you happen to see a couple thousand butterflies going south? Couldn't miss 'em. Wings. Orange. Kinda look exactly like me. Shoo! I haven't seen any stupid butterfly! Whoa! Someone's got issues. You're not very sociable, are you? (Slurps) I'm extremely sociable. You're just really pushy and annoying. And you're just hiding your true feelings behind bravado. Just like my 222nd brother, Carlos. - I'm not hiding anything. - Good. Then you won't mind when I tell everyone where you live. - Don't you dare! - Try and stop me. (Giggles) Hmm. (Grunts) You better hope your wings move as fast as your mouth. Oh, they move faster than your stinky butt. Huh! (All): Wow! - Wow! - Wow, it's Nachi! (Gasps) Wow! Look at him go! (Groans) (Grunts) (Grunts) (Laughs) You're slower than a baby turtle! - Hey! Don't be a hater. - Hmm. - Ahh! - What in the world?! - Hmm? - (Laughs nervously) Come on over here, Narizón! Hmm. (Grunts) Nachi! Cuidado! Uh! Uh! Ah. Ahhh! (Xochi): Remember to wash those armpits! You've got piojos! (Nachi): They're fleeea... (Gasps) (Screams) (Gasps) Hold on! Nachi! - Wonderful. - (Amaya): Swim! Rocks! I'm gonna die. Ah! Ah! Ahhh! Ahh! Huh? (Groans) (Coughing) Morning, Balam. Sir. Nachi, how many times have I told you? Stay away from the waterfall. Oh, I don't know, between 10 and 10,952. I can't be around all the time to watch after you. You don't have to. I can handle myself. (Animal): I'd blame his parents but he's got none. - (Chuckles) - Hey, Nachi! Stay away from him! He is such a bad influence! When I was a cub, I learned that if I wanted respect and acceptance, it was up to me to make it so. Yeah, but you were a powerful jaguar. Me? No-one cares about me. I'm just Nachi, the troublemaker. The best way to make others care about you is to care about them. Nachi, that was very brave of you to attempt to save that butterfly. (Gasps) (Pako): Hey, excuse me. Uh, pardon me. (Laughs) Whoa! Thickness! Did you lose weight? - (Laughs) - Hmm? Comin' through. Whoa-ho-ho! Is this real hair? Oh, man! I'm so jealous. Whoa-ha-ha-ha! Nachi! Whassup, amigo? Ooh! Huh? (Squeaks) Wait up. I deserve that. Sweet jump. You are the coolest koati this side of the river. (Groans) I'm the only koati this side of the river. And the coolest. That whole water-flip-fall- I'm-drowning-Balam rescue. Epic! Had us all sitting on the edge of our rock. Really? You almost gave me a heart attack! (Beating) (Gasps) Nachi? (Amaya): Mijo, I'm so glad you're OK. Hey. Look at me in the eyes when I speak to you. Where are you going? Where I can be by myself. How are you going to fit in if you always want to be by yourself? I don't wanna fit in. I don't want to fit in either. Leave us alone. Whoa, wait for me! Let's not fit in together! Oh! - (Splashing noise) - Urgh! - Eww! - (Laughter) (Amaya): Thank you, sir. Well, you know, kids will be kids. - (Rumbling) - (Gasps) Oh! Another one! Ohhh. (Birds screech) - Oh. - Gather the council. Now! Hmm. (Indistinct chatter) Sir. Your highness. Members of the council, the ground shakes are getting stronger and more persistent. We do not know their cause, but something... - (Laughs) - Shh! ..is very wrong in our land of Xo. Hmm. (Chatter) (Zaina): Sorry I'm late, everyone. I was sunning on a rock and lost track of time. My blood hasn't been this warm in days. (Laughs) Don't I look fabulous? (Groans) Don't roll your eyes at me, old man, I could swallow you whole. Point is, Zaina's here, we can start now. (All): Huh? Nice of you to join us, Zaina. Oh, your greatness. I wouldn't miss it for the world. I'm even wearing brand-new skin. You like? Ahhh! (Screeches) Amaya, you know what I mean, right, Mama? Zaina, know your place! You're so sweet. I love you, mis bombones. But, please, let's not make this meeting all about me. (All laugh) - (Roaring) - (Animals scream) There are urgent matters to attend to and important decisions to make! Of course. Only you can make decisions here, your highness. But we'll see for how long. I'm summoning Cocopa to provide his wisdom on the threat we face. Cocopa, we need your guidance. (Magical twinkling) (Animals gasp) Hmm. Ahhh! Oh! The mighty council... Ah, Cocopa, I sense there is a grea... A disturbance. Yes. Something big is coming. Bigger than anything you've ever seen. The spirits will reveal it to us. (Moans) (Pako): I wish I could do that. All lady frogs like magic, you know? Only trick I know is how to make 'em disappear. - Oh! - Shhh! Ooomm! Chaos. (Growls) Fear. - (Gasps) Ay! - Destruction. But there is hope. Everything must die to be truly reborn. (Bang!) (Gasps) Ahh? Huh? - (Gasps) - The time has come. Wow! (Zaina): Bravo! Fantastic show. But it doesn't tell us anything. There is something coming our way and we must prepare. Hmm. As always, Balam, our benevolent dictator, is right. Something is coming and we don't want to be here when it arrives. There's really only one solution. (Animals): Hmm? The time has finally come to move south. I know just the place. - Sunshine, clear air, dry heat. - (All gasp) Amaya, you'll finally be able to get that horrible frizz out of your feathers. Ooh! Trust me, my friends. It will be better for everyone. (Balam): Or, Zaina, will it just be better for you? Lying out in the hot sun, while the rest of us search for shade and water. We all know beautiful new habitats are hard to find. Too big, too small, no sauna, loud neighbours... Nobody gets everything they want. (Balam): No! I have told you many times. We are not going anywhere! Xo is our home. Um-hum. - (Rumbling) - (Gasps) Oh, heavens... - We've got to move! - (Panicked voices) - Amaya! - Yes, sir! Make sure the young and weak are safe. - Right away, sir. - (Roars) (Pako): Oh! Oh! Oh! (Nachi): Pako, hold on! Holding! Ahh! (Screams) Everyone, run to a clear zone! Stick together! Be calm. Ahhh! Help! Mom, where are you? Run! Ugh! Ahh! Help! Help! Mommy, I'm falling! Birds nest! Birds nest! Birds nest! Mommy! Mommy! A la bio, a la bao, a la bim bom... Baaaa! Oh! - Ugh! - (Nachi): Hold on tight! - (Strains) - Too tight! Too tight! (Panicked voices) Come on, I'll get you outta here! You sure your back can handle this? (Groaning and panicked cries) (Screaming) 'Bye, Pako! (Laughs) (Balam): Well done, Nachi. (Nachi): Yes, sir. (Pako): The world is coming apart! - (Clatter) - (Amaya): Faster! (Whiskers): Everything will be fine. Follow me! (Balam): Stay together! Stay in the open and don't leave the circle! Did everyone make it? There's someone there. Mati... Be still, little one. (Whimpers) Don't be scared. I'm here. (Whimpering) Run now! (Groans) (Structure cracking) Oh! Oh! (Screaming) (Balam groaning) Ohhh! (Gasps) (Groans) (Rumbling) - Watch out, Balam! - (Nachi): Balam! Behind you! - (Crash!) - (Gasps) Huh? Ohhh. Oh! (Gasps) Oh. (Amaya): Come on, everyone. Let's go! (Panicked voices) We have to raise the tree! - Come on, everyone. Push! - Push... - Come on, everyone. Push... - Push! (Pants, then grunts) (Grunting) (Amaya): Don't give up now! Push! (Animals grunt) Come on! Give it your best! (Amaya): Now! Come on, everybody. (All animals grunt) Oh. Oh! (Silence) (Amaya): Oh. Oh, dear. (Sniffles) (Sad music) Mmm. (Growls softly) Huh? Oh. - (Balam takes a deep breath) - Oh! (Balam exhales) (Balam growls softly) (Gasps) (Emotional music) (Spanish song plays) (Thunder crashes) (Cocopa): From above, House of Heaven... ..where star people and ancestors gather. May their blessings come to us now. From the centre, galactic source, which is everywhere. At once, may everything be known as the light of mutual love. (Blows) Wow. Wow! (Cocopa speaks foreign language) All hail the harmony of mind and nature. Wow. And so it is. Wow. Hmm. Hmm. Huh? (Squelching noises) (Squawks) Oh. Ah. (Chatter) Ahem! Uh-uh. Um... My fellow animals, as you know, we have lost our beloved... (Gasps) (Zaina): I will take care of that, you little fool. - Go take a nap. - Huh! My fellow animals, don't be afraid. In this time of crisis and heartbreak, Zaina is here to take advantage... I mean... to help everyone. (Tree rat): Excuse me? Hmm! Wait a minute, mamacita, wait a minute. I mean, I don't remember voting for you! - Look, a flying pig! - (All gasp) What? Ayy! Nope, it was just a cloud. Anyways, as I was saying, along with your beloved council, I have assessed the damage to our home. I don't remember assessing anything. We have no drinking water. No place for shelter. Staying in Xo is a death sentence. (All animals gasp) There is only one solution. - My friends, we must all leave. - (All gasp) What?! Leave Xo? But this is our home. (Animals mutter) I know leaving will be hard. We'll miss this place just as much as anyone. But, mis cachorros, we must face reality. Because the jungle as we knew it is gone. (Clears throat) You're right, but where should we go? Hmm? Funny you should ask. I know of a paradise to the south with abundant food, glorious clear waters... Huh? - ..cool sticky mud holes... - Ahh! - And luminous clear blue skies. - I wanna go! I wanna go! What's the name of this paradise? It's called, um, Zainanquilla... Zainalandia? Oh! It's called... Notxoland! (Jithu): Notxoland! Uh! No-No-Notxoland! Everybody, let's go to Notxoland! Mommy, we're going to Notxoland! (Jithu): Notxoland! Notxoland! Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah. With me as your boss, we can build a brave new home filled with hope, based on... ugh... ..based on amor. Held together by compassion and, above all, mutual... Ugh! ..respect! A place where we can thrive, where all animals will be treated equally. Wow! Where anyone can visit me in my new huge palace, as long as they have an appointment and I am not too busy. Where we will be a vibrant community even greater than before. Follow me, friends, to Notxoland! (Animals cheer and chitter happily) (Nachi): Liar! (Animals gasp) Come on, no-one's actually buying this, right? I don't want any part of your Noxn-nala-land, whatever. - This will always be my home. - Ay, Nachi. Hijole! (Zaina): Oh, yes. By all means, we should take advice from a child who lives alone and never shows any interest in the community. - Ssssss! - (Gasps) Oh, yeah? And why should we follow you? You all heard me warn Balam at the council that we should leave. Ay, Balamcito, if only he would have listened... ..he'd still be with us, bravely guiding our safe and clear path to Notxoland. No. If Balam was alive, he'd tell us to stay here and rebuild. (Amaya): Maybe Nachi has a point. This has always been our home. Hmm! Chima, she lost her first tooth right here. - (Animals): Ohhh! - (Giggles) And Igu hatched right over there! And grumpy old Bumbaa's been buried here since he expired. I haven't died yet! (Laughter) Sure, of course! We can stay here, fix up Xo, and die of starvation in the process! Uh-uh. Have our bodies eaten by worms and rot, forgotten in the darkness. Or another way to go is you can follow me to Notxoland, and under my rule, live safe, warm and very happy forever. - Notxoland! Notxoland! - (Animals chatter excitedly) (Jithu): Everybody, let's go to Notxoland! (Laughs) (Zaina laughs) We can't give up. We can still make it work here! Huh? (Hissing) So, who's with me? (Zaina): Save your breath, orphan. The choice has been made. Well, I'm not going! (Zaina): If that's what you want, feel free to stay behind. And say hello to Balam. I'm sure you will be seeing him soon. Hmph! It's settled. We leave in the morning for Notxoland. (Cheering) The nerve of that annoying little rat. He almost unravelled my entire plan. But, finally, after years of waiting, I take my rightful place as a cruel, vindictive, all-powerful leader. OK, that title might need a little massaging, but everything else is falling into place. Ohh. (Laughs) - Oh! - Hmm? But why did you do that? Because I can. (Laughs) (Laughing continues) (Amaya): Nachi? Mm-hmm. (Nachi sighs) Leave me alone. Oh! (Amaya): You shouldn't be here. It looks unsafe and dirty. I think the place has a rustic charm, if you ask me. (Nachi): Nobody asked you, coward! Aaaah! You say you wanna be my friend, but you didn't even have my back at the meeting. Hey, I don't have guts like you, alright? My large intestine is a small intestine. (Bouncing noise) Ahh! (Amaya): Nachi, I'm surprised you even care about the move. Why are you resisting? (Sighs) I'm gonna show you something. But I don't want you to tell anyone about this. And I mean anyone. Got it? Ahhh! Not one word. Hmm! Mmm! Mmm. Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm! Not a word. (Amaya): Ahh? (Blows) (Coughing) (Amaya): Oh, wow! Ohhhh! Wow! What are these? Look. I haven't always been the only koati. There were others just like me. Maybe they were my family. What if I leave... ..and they come back? Now everything makes sense! Why you love it here, why you live here. It's like a puzzle that needed to be solved and now it's solved! You live here because... ..you enjoy primitive artwork! Yes, Pako, that's exactly what I meant. I knew you wouldn't understand. (Amaya): Nachi, wait. Mijo, I love you as if you were my own blood, so I have to tell you, those pictures are very, very old. I don't know if the koatis are returning. Por favor, Nachi, before you make a final decision to stay, do one thing for this old lady. Huh? Fine, I'll do it. What do you want? - Summon Cocopa for advice. - But how? Call to him and he will guide you. Promise you'll do it? I promise. Ohhh. (Chuckles) Cocopa, wherever you might be, I need to ask you for guidance. Hmm. What should I have for dinner? (Buzzing) Mmm. (Gulps) He answered! (Buzzing) Gross. That definitely wasn't Cocopa. (Gasps) Cocopa, will I ever find the frog of my dreams? (Panting) You know, I'd settle for a toad with frog-like qualities. Pako, stop talking so I can concentrate. Don't you get it? I'm the one that's supposed to summon Cocopa and ask him the questions. (Pako): Órale! Go, go! Summon Cocopa. I'll just sit here and be quiet. (Grunts) (Sighs) OK, Cocopa, I need your guidance. Should I follow Zaina or... ..should I stay? Nachi, did you ask? Did you ask? Ugh! Pako! Ugh! Ahh! This was stupid. - So, did you ask? - Hmph! (Nachi): No. Because there's nothing else I need to know. I'm going to sleep. Wait, wait, but aren't we gonna stay up and wait for Cocopa? Yeah, right. We'll be waiting forever. Yeah? Well, well, I'm waiting. And I don't care if it takes the entire... (Yawns) (Snoring) Cocopa, if you can really answer anything, then please tell me... ..how can I find my family? (Snoring and buzzing) What? What? What's happening? Uh? Wait. Uh, uh. Wait, wait, wait! No! Ah! Ah! No! Aaah! (Loud explosion) Oh! Where am I? Wh-what is this? (Gasps) Cocopa? Am I dreaming? The answer for your question. Find the mouth that does not speak. Huh? That's the answer?! Really? Any chance you could throw a few specifics my way? A map, directions, anything? (Cocopa): Follow the sun in the day... ..and the moon at night. But remember, you don't have much time. Huh? If you haven't found it by the third moon... ..your family will be gone forever. (Cracking) (Explosion) Wa-wait! How am I gonna know when I get there? (Cocopa): When you discover El Árbol de la Vida, the Tree of Life, the oldest tree in the land, it will tell you where to go. Cocopa, I don't get what you're saying. I wanted answers and now I'm more confused than ever. (Cocopa): In time... you will. (Whooshing) Trust your instinct. You have no better friend. But, Nachi, beware of the lake of fire. A lake of fire? Really? Well, that's nice. I like how you slipped it in at the end. Trust your instincts. Uh? Huh? Huh? Hmm. (Nachi): Amaya! Amaya! It happened! I saw Cocopa. He came, uh, like, from out of nowhere! And there were lots of... everywhere. And the wall lit up and it was like... Slow down, slow down. But tell me, what did he say? Something about a mouth that does not speak. Oh! And a Tree of Life. Oh, and something about a... - What did you say? - ..a lake of fire? - (Amaya): The Tree of Life? - Hmm. If I find it, I know I'll find my family. I've gotta go. Hmm. That'll be a long and dangerous journey. - Yes! - (Pako grunts) (Amaya): It's not safe. Someone has to go with you. Huh? Hey! Me! Me, me, me, me! - Me, me! - I'll go by myself. - No, I'll come with you. - (Pako): Hey! But, Amaya, if you come with me, who's gonna take care of all the younger animals? (Amaya): Hmm! Mmmm. Hmmph. Hmm. You do have a point. (Pako): Ahem! What is it, Pako? Pick me! Huh? Ahhh! Wait, what? No, no, no, no, no! Nobody is coming with me. Especially not him. (Pako): We're off on a quest to the Tree of Life. Ha ha! The two amigos. Ready for danger at every turn. - Just say where and I'm there. - Yeah, come along. That way if I run into a big hungry animal, I'll have something to feed it while I run away. (Pako gulps) (Pako's mother): Pako, mi amor. (Gasps) What is it, Mom? Can't you see I'm busy here? I'm going on a dangerous quest with my best bud. - You found a friend! - Hmm! - A real one?! - I have lots of real friends! And a few that I've made up. A friend. You go ahead. But aren't you forgetting something? - Hmm? - It starts with a 'K'. And ends with an 'iss'. (Gasps) A kiss! (Loud kissing) Huh? Hmm. (Pako clears throat) As I was saying, ready to take on any danger that comes our way. - (Birds screeching nearby) - Hmm? (Animals chatter) Yes, mis amores. You're far too kind. I don't deserve this.

Hey, I can keep it shut when I want. Watch! (Inhales deeply) (Grunts) (Gasps, then chuckles) See? How long was it? Like an hour? About three seconds. Hmm? Three seconds?! Whoo-hoo! I just broke my record. (Xochi): Whaa-aaa! Watch out! Watch out! Watch out! - Huh? - Oh! Ow! Ow! Oh, that ground flew right up and hit me! (Pako): Ohhh. (Gasps) Oh, hey, Nachi. Remember me? How could I forget? So, where ya headed? A-ha-ha-ha! No! None of your business. It's a secret. Oh! Oh. I'm so good at keeping secrets. Did you know that Rafa and Anabella are dating and that their parents don't know? See? I kept that secret. (Giggles) We're on our way to the Tree of Life. (Gasps) Oh, yeah? Can I come along? Sorry. Nachi and I are kinda on a personal quest. I mean, I'd call it a vision quest, but the Cocopa leaves a lot out so it's more like a "lack of vision" quest. Wait a second, uh, what was your question? So what does this Tree of Life look like? Reaches to the sky. Has a huge trunk, large branches... I found it! - Hmm? Where? - Whoa! (Xochi): It's gotta be it. Look how big and tall it is. What are we supposed to do now that I found it? Well, if you must know, we're supposed to ask it for directions. (Xochi): OK, please stand back. I got this. Ahem. Hello, tree. Do you happen to know where to find the monarch sanctuary? (Puts on fake voice) Straight ahead. Take a turn to your right. - (Normal voice) I knew it! - (Both): Hmm? - What a nice guy! Right? - Huh? Ugh. Whatever. I gotta get going to find the other monarchs. See ya! 'Bye! Hmm! Oww. Out of my way! Oww! Ay, Xochi! Oww! Oy! Oh, that one hurt. That is one messed-up butterfly. You like her, don't you? (Laughs) (Pako): Me? No! Is it obvious? It's already getting dark. So why don't we stop and catch some slee... (Snoring) That was fast. (Snoring continues) Hmm. (Snoring continues) (Hissing) Ahhhhh! Has anyone ever told you you hiss in your sleep? Hmm. (Hissing) (Pako snores) Hmm? (Pako snores) Hmmm! Oh. Oh. (Hissing) Pako. (Gasps) Pako, wake up! It wasn't me. I didn't pee on the lily pad. - (Hissing) - Huh? Huh? Ahhh! So you thought you could defy Zaina. Pako! (Snores) Fine, it was me, I confess. I peed on... Jithu! That's right! Zaina's butt-kissing, brown- nosing, fat-headed suck-up. Jithu, compadre. Great to see you again, man. Oh, my! I really wish we could hang out and catch up on old times, but we have to run, you know? We should run. You're not going anywhere! Ohhh! Oh, cool! Ha! (Nachi whimpers) Time for us to say... Uhh! Adiós, amigos! Get them! (Panting and whimpering) (Screams) (Indistinct chatter) (Screams) Ah, OK. (Grunts) (Screams) (Groans) (Grunts) (Screams) (Grunts) (Screams) Fine. (Pants) (Pako speaks Spanish) - What do we do now?! - (Gasps) Argh! (Grunts) - I have an idea. - Oh! (Grunts) Wait, Nachi! What are you doing, man? Hurry up. Get in. See you on the other side. Whoooaaaa... ..aaaa... ..aaaaaaaaah! Oh! Oh! Oh! (Groans) I made it! Ahh! - (Cracking) - (Nachi grunts) Give up, Nachi. There's nowhere to run. (Roars) (All growl) Aaaahhh! (Grunts) (Roars) (Nachi screams) - (Snap!) - Ooh! (Nachi screams) Nachi, I got you! Huh? Hmm! Over here, amigo! Ooh-hoo. Ooh-hoo. Oh, no! No! - (Splat!) - (Groans) (Jithu): You won't get away! (Panting) (Pako groans) Huh? (Both laugh) Oh, yeah? It looks like we already did. - (Both laugh) - Na-na, na-na-na! (Growls) Give Zaina a big wet kiss from me! (Pako): And another one from me, compadre! (Laughs) (Groans) Eh! Eh! Eh? Eh? (Squeals happily) (Gulp!) (Laughter) I wish Balam could've seen that. Did you see the look on Jithu's face? It was all like... (Roars) (Laughter) It was like my tail had superpowers. Wahhh! How about my tongue? - Super tongue! - He-he! (Sings fanfare) Super tail! (Pants) (Grunts) In this corner fighting out of the great land of Xo, the mega-colossal, spectacular, greatest tag team duo of Super Tongue... ..and Super Tail. Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Super brothers in the fight against evildoers everywhere! (Laughter) Hey, wouldn't that be cool... - (Pako): Nachi... - (Laughs) ..if we really were brothers? Yeah. Huh? But... but we're not brothers. (Pako): Hmm? Hmm? I don't have a family. Oh. Ohhh. Ohh! Coming, Super Tongue? (Laughs) You know it, Super Tail! (Grunts) (Pako laughs) (Suspenseful music) Ay, amorcito, those powerful legs and that strong jaw. I can't think of anyone I'd rather have carry me hundreds of miles. And I could really sink my fangs into your brother Luis, but that would kill my ride. Therefore, you're both perfect, strong, brave, good-looking soldiers for my new kingdom of Notxoland. Full-time bobos, muscular, dumb and extremely easy to mould. (Whiskers): Zaina... How much longer till we get there? Patience, abuelo. (Amaya): Many of the animals cannot keep going without rest. I'm losing patience with the stragglers. You don't see me complaining about the journey. Ha! You're being carried. You have no idea how tiring it is telling everyone where to go! Let's see, who wants to give up on Notxoland? (Animals groan) Oh, well. You can't please everyone. But, please, look at those faces. They're saying lead us. We need your guidance. You're brilliant, you're beautiful. And how did you get your skin so soft? (Gasps) My secret? No mice between meals and one camu camu a day. - Papacitos... - (Growls) If you'll excuse me, we have a long way to march... (Whiskers): Get out of the way! (Zaina): ..before I comfortably set up for the night! So lost. So hungry. So... long. Ugh! Keep moving. Or else you're going to wind up someone else's food. (Pako groans) Ahh. (Chuckles) We're saved! (Gulps) - Huh? Huh? - Huh? Ahhhh! Oh! Oh! Whoa! - Huh? - (Pako grunts) (Pako continues groaning) - (Pako splutters) - Shh! Shh! (Pako): Huh? Ohhh! Whoa! You thinking what I'm thinking? That if we climb to the top of this giant tree that's bigger than anything I've ever seen before, we might possibly be able to spot the Tree of Life? Hmmm? (Sighs) Why don't you try again? (Pako gasps) (Both): The Tree of Life! - Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! - (Laughs) - Up high! Oooh! - Ugh! Race ya to the top, buddy! (Laughs) Are you sure you wanna race? Ahhhh! (Pako whimpers) (Nachi grunts) (Birds caw) Look! So beautiful! (Splat!) Ugh! Seriously?! You know what this means, Nachi? The macaws have blessed us. It's a sign of good luck. - (Retches) - Come on, dude, knock it off. Ooh! (Retches) Nachi! I think we found heaven! (Laughs) Argh! Argh! Whoa! (Gulps, then inhales deeply) (Grunts and groans) It's a big one! Eee! Eee-eee-eee! (Gasps) (Munches) - (Crack!) - Huh? (Both scream) (Grunts) (Pako screams, then thuds) (Nachi): Enough messing around. We need to get to the top. Egh. Mmm! (Laughs) Yummy, so good! (Munches) One more bite... Hey, Nachi! I'm coming. Gulp! Hmm? (Screams) Nachi! Nachi! (Nachi): Look, Pako, it's breathing! Oh! Ohh. (Groans) Nachi! Something weird's happening! I know, I can feel it too. I think we're close. Ohh! Oh. (Gasps) (Growls) Stay back! I got my eye on you! Bleurgh! Come on, Pako. I see the top! Ehh. Ehh? Give a kiss to Mama! (Evil laughter) Ahhh! (Groans) We made it, Pako! Quick, it's closing! Pako, get up! Pako, what are you doing? (Groans) (Cacophony of voices) Pako! Pako! What happened? Tasty mushroom. Kiss Mama bye-bye. No! Wake up! Come on, snap out of it! Pako, breathe! (Grunts with exertion) Please, please... (Pako coughs) (Gasps, then coughs) Hi. Yes! (Pako groans) (Nachi laughs) Super Tongue lives! Ha-ha! Well, I don't recommend the mushrooms. You nearly died back there! And you stopped to save me? Thanks, Nachi! - (Creaking) - Hmm. We'll find another way. Besides, there was something... ..someone more important. Ah! Hijole, nobody's ever called me important before. Slimy, annoying, gross, sure, but important? Never! (Laughs) Come on, maybe we can just push our way through the top. ♪ We're marching forever ♪ Together through whatever ♪ I think... ♪ Let's not mention this to anyone. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! (Tiredly) Go! Go! (Gasps) Huh? Ahhh. Oh. Ohhh! Uh? Huh? - Pako, we made it! - (Gasps) - (Pako laughs) - Whoa! Brochacho! Come on, now, give me five. Wait, actually four. (Booming explosion) (Nachi): What is it? (Calli): It's a smoky mountain, dude. (Grunts) The smoky patterns help me meditate. (Chuckles) I become one with the universe. Do you mind? Ommmm... - Huh? - Hmm. Ommmm... (Pako): Whoa! (Calli hums) Whoa! (Gasps) Whoa! (Calli groans) (Pako muffled): Whoa! I said, do you mind? No, it's cool! I get stepped on all the time. Ha! So, what's the deal? Do you live here or something? (Pako): It's kinda cool here. I like it. It's a little dusty... (Sneezes) Well, there goes the neighbourhood. Yes, I live here. Alone. With my thoughts. Sometimes without my thoughts. Like when they go on vacation. - But I give them that. - (Both laugh) They come back refreshed. You should try it sometime. So what are you doing here? There comes a time, little froggy... (Clears throat) ..when a bird has to fly away and lose itself. Wait! I mean, find itself. (Munches happily) So, have you? What? - Found yourself? - Hmm? Duh! I'm right here! (Chuckles) OK, not yet. But I found this cool guayaba that kinda looks like me. Guayabirri! Oh! Hmm. Look at that. Huh? Huh? - Yeah. Who's who? (Laughs) - Who's who? (Calli): Mm-hm. So what are you guys doing here? I was sent to the top of this tree to get some directions. Nachi, Nachi, maybe he's got them! (Laughs) Right, up, down, left! Am I close? How can you give me directions when you can't even find yourself? Oh! Good question. And that is your answer. Oh! So now I've gotta get back to some serious finding myself time... ..alone. Mmmmmm. (Rumbling) (Eruption) Why is that mountain making the ground shake? Blah, blah, blah. Why does it matter? 'Cause the last time the ground shook, it destroyed our home. Bummer, but that thing grumbles and spits smoke out of its mouth all the time! Wait. Did you say "mouth"? Maybe that's the mouth that doesn't speak. We need to go check it out. Excellent idea, compadre. Send my regards. Argh. I thought you left. Nope! You're taking us. Why would I do that? 'Cause we can't fly. Hello? How else are we gonna get there? How? Oh. Yeah. OK, OK. (Sighs) If I take you there, will you leave me alone? - (Pako laughs) - (Gasps) Promise! Huh! (Calli): Uh, hmm, hmm. - I'm Nachi and this is Pako. - Hi. I am Calli. Hop on, I guess. (Pako): Not sure we thought this all the way through, Nachi. (Nachi): Yeah. Isn't that the fun of it? (Calli): Hold on tight. (Nachi and Pako): Whoa! Look, Pako! Look! - (Pako): I can't! - (Nachi laughs) Wow! Nachi, we are flying! (Nachi and Pako): Whoa! - Oh! - Oh-oh! Whoo! (Nachi): Whoo-hoo! Look at us, Pako. The sky has no limit! Yeah! (Laughs) (Nachi laughs) (Pako): Whoa! (Nachi): Oh, no. (Groaning) (Coughs) - See anything? - Nope. - (Pako groans) - Huh? It'll probably help if you open your eyes. I was afraid you'd say that. (Cries) (Gasps) (Nachi): Wait a second. That's the lake of fire! Ahh. Argh! (Calli): Yeah, fiiiiire! - It looks like it's rising! - (Pako): Whoa! (Calli): Ohhh. Oh, no. I'm feeling mucho dizzy. (Pako): Whoa! Too low! Too low! - Right, right! - (Pako screams) (Groans) Go your other right! - (Calli): Going other right! - Whoa! (Nachi and Pako groan) Hello. What a trip! Really turned my world upside down, uh? Well, that's because you are upside down. (Calli laughs, then trills) Whoo-hoo! - (Xochi screams) - (Nachi and Pako scream) (Calli): What the... Oh, hey, guys. Guess who? You again? (Groans) Wow! Good guess. What are you doing here? See that river of fire coming out of that mountain? (Nachi): Kinda hard to miss. Well, I've gotta stop it! (Pako): Ohhh. Stop it? Huh! You're a butterfly. There's no way. Well, I have to. It's heading straight for my home. - (Gasps) - (Booming explosion) (Lava gurgles) Listen, we have to get these butterflies to safety. Ugh! I woke up at the wrong side of the branch today. - Let's go! - (Pako screams) - (Xochi): Come on, guys! - (Calli): Do not yell in my ear. OK? Put your feet down. This isn't your living room. (Xochi): Here, here, here. It's here! Wow! Everyone, listen to me! We need to leave! A river of fire is coming this way! Everyone! We need to get out now! (Pako): Wake up now! There's a fire coming! Come on! Kids these days. They'll say anything to get attention. It's no use. Ugh. Let me handle this. Calli accessing inner anger. (Calli makes increasingly louder cries) You're all going to die! Ooooh! Oh! Wow. What a release! (Plop!) (Screams) (All scream) (Thud, then continue screaming) - Oh! - (Gasps) Huh! Follow us to the Tree of Life! - (Calli): No! - (Nachi and Pako shout) We had a deal. Yow! Say goodbye to solitude! Come on, everyone. Follow us! (Screaming continues) (Xochi): Come on, guys, hurry up! (Nachi): We're almost there. Xochi, hurry up! (Xochi): Come on, quickly! - Quickly! - Quickly! - (Xochi): OK, OK. - No! (Gasps) - Oh! - (Gasps) Oh. (Sobs) (Xochi cries) Huh? (Xochi cries) There, there, my darling little orange one. Is everybody OK? No. Not everyone made it. Ohhh! (Cries) (Groans) Hey, what's wrong, Nachi? I've been thinking, Pako. Coming here was a huge mistake. I'm never gonna find my family. What? There's one moon left and we haven't found the mouth that doesn't speak. Doesn't matter. First Balam, and now hundreds of butterflies lost their lives. But thousands survived because of us! You have to know that! We've been lucky enough just to make it this far. I think we should just join Zaina. What?! This is Zaina we're talking about. She nearly killed us. Well, maybe if we apologise for leaving, she'll let us back in? I'm going in the morning. If you don't want to come, I'll understand. - (Xochi): Um-um-um! - Huh? Hmm! You can't leave! What? You can't quit now. We've come so far! Nachi, I need you. Need me for what? So you can get lost again? Let's just find Zaina and see if she'll take us back. You know what? No! I don't trust that selfish, stuck-up, power-hungry snake. - She's the worst! - Wait! I saw a selfish, stuck-up, power-hungry-looking snake - leading a bunch of animals... - What? ..on my way to the sanctuary. - Where were they headed? - Towards the fire mountain! Huh. We've gotta warn them. (Pako): That's my Nachi. (Xochi giggles) And we're coming with you. But how will we get there? (Calli hums merrily) Ahhhh! - (Nachi): Ah! - (Xochi): Hey. Oh? Calli, we need you to fly us somewhere. - Please, please, please. - (Pako): Por fa! Por fa! (Xochi): Please! Please! Please! Oh, how am I ever gonna have time to find myself? Calli, you must lose yourself to find yourself. (Momentous music) Whoa! You just blew my mind. Let's do this! - Hmm. - (Xochi giggles) (Suspenseful music) (Groans) (Zaina): Keep moving! You can do this. I believe in all of you! - (Pants) - Except for you! If you can't keep up, dig yourself a grave. Ohhhh! Useless eaters not worthy of my rule. I believe we have to get rid of everyone but the strong. (Gasps) (Ting!) Cover me. Ohh. (Inhales) (Slurps) (Amaya): Zaina! (Slurps quickly) The children are weak and thirsty. Share that water now! - (Others grumble) - What water? We are all thirsty, Mama. But with strength and determination, we should move forward to a future with water for all. (Slurps) - (Gasps) - (All grunt) Shh! You'd be lost without... (Nachi): Zaina! (All gasp) (Gasps) The rat and the chubby frog? I thought you were... Dead?! Sorry to disappoint. Yeah! And 'chubby' is a hurtful term. I prefer 'full-figured'. - Oh? - No, no, mister. - You coil up and sit. - Hmm. (Amaya): Nachi! Oh, Nachi! Have you come back to join the group? No, I've come back to save the group! - You're all in danger. - (All gasp) And here he goes, "You're all in danger!" Not while I am in charge! She's leading you to a smoky mountain that shoots rivers of fire. - (Zaina laughs) - (All gasp) Listen to yourself. A smoky mountain spitting fire? Your crazy stories stink! Oh. Actually, I think you might be smelling me. Haven't hit a bath in like four weeks. Uff! (Chuckles) Zaina, if we don't find a safe place before the mountain spits fire again, it'll be over. Everyone will die. (All gasp) This is total nonsense! Mis amores, pay attention. The rat is clearly lying just to undermine my authority. Shame on you! Fear not, we will soon be in paradise, in Notxoland. Notxoland! Notxoland! Everybody, let's go to Notxoland! See? You clearly are not wanted here. If you know what's good for yourself, you would leave and never return. (Gulps) Hmm! Don't worry. We'll be back. (Nachi grunts) (Pako): OK, what's the plan? Don't know yet. (Calli gulps) I like it. Short, sweet, and to the point. Except for the part where you don't know. (Nachi): Mm-hm. Whoa! Want me to get rid of them... again? No, you slimy idiot! You had your chance. It's time to bite back! Cocopa, I need your help. I have to save everyone and I don't know how. (Whooshing) (Gasps) Cocopa! Find the mouth that does not speak. Ugh! You already told me that when I was looking for my family. It didn't work. Please, Cocopa, just tell me what to do now. Huh? Two questions, one answer. Huh? And remember. The last moon is here. What mouth doesn't speak? (Water laps) - (Nachi gasps) - (Trills) Huh? Huh? You have a mouth. Do you speak? (Trills) Hmm. I can take a hint. (Trills) (Gasps) (Trills) (Trills) (Nachi gasps) Whoa! Huh? (Gasps) (Gasps) It's here! The mouth that doesn't speak! - Hmm. - (Water sloshes) Huh? Whoa! Ahhhh! Whoa! (Screams) (Gasps) Huh? (Rumbling) Huh? Ha! This is it! This is the place that will keep us safe! (Trills) Huh? Ha. - (Eruption) - Huh? Huh. (Grunts) Argh! Ha! So your fire mountain was real after all. It's so kind of you to find me a safe place for my new kingdom. Round up the animals, but leave the weak and the old behind. This is a wonderful opportunity to thin the herd. Hmm. I can't believe you. You led everyone away from their homes and now you just want to abandon them? You're evil! Evil, attractive, and in charge! (Dramatic music) He can't be too far! What's happening? (Xochi): Over there! We gotta help him. - Coming in hot! - (Pako): Oh, not so fast. You challenge my leadership?! What leadership? - (Pako): Zaina! - Hmm? You stay away from Nachi or... Or what?! You'll attack me and die a slow and horrible death at the tip of my fangs?! I was going to say, "Or else I'm gonna tell my mommy on you." I've waited my entire life to assume my rightful position and I won't let some precocious loser undermine my power! Your cave will keep the strong safe and under my rule. And my rule alone! - They will repopulate the land! - What? What?! - (Zaina gasps) - Pako, go! Gather all the animals and bring them here. Go now! - (Pako): Go! - (Xochi): Let's go! I think it's time to kill you. Argh! (Nachi): Wah! - (Zaina gasps) - (Nachi grunts) (Grunts) (Nachi): Yah! (Hisses) (Zaina): It's over, you worthless rat! - Argh! - (Nachi): Koati! I'm a koati! - And the name is Nachi. - (Explosion) (Grunts) (Volcano roars) - Huh? Oh. - (Animals scream) Hey, guys, no pushing. Stop those weak losers from going in! (Grunts) (Animals scream) Órale, lady, move! Come on. You're so heavy! (Xochi): Everyone, let's go! Let's go! (Pako): Jithu. (Pako clears throat) What's it gonna be? You in or out? (Gulps) (Grunts) Oh! (Gasps) - (Zaina): Ahhhh! - (Nachi grunts) - (Zaina shouts) - (Nachi groans) (Zaina): Ahhh! (Nachi groans) (Zaina laughs) (Animals scream) (Nachi groans) (Amaya): Zaina! You're hurting him! Let him go! (Nachi groans) You stay out of this, you old hag! I'm sick of you telling me what to do! I will destroy you! Oh! (Pants) Ohhh! Hmm! (Nachi): Your time ruling the animals is over, Zaina. They'll never care about you because you don't really care about them. You only think about yourself. You're one to talk. You're always on your own. You're right. But not anymore. Everyone that I care about is right here. Ay, Dios mio. That's so beautiful. Hmm. - (Bird caws) - Huh? (Thunder crashes) (Zaina screams) Huh? Huh! Hurry, Super Tongue! Ah! Ohhhhh! (Nachi): Ahh! Huh? Ahhhh! (Zaina laughs evilly) Hmm. Ahh! (Pako): Bleh! (Screams) - Huh! - (Tongue creaks) (Giggles) (Zaina screams) (Calli): Oh! Ohhh. (Zaina): You better let go of me, now! (Calli): Are you sure about that? (Zaina screams) Oh. Carry on. - (Nachi grunts) Ha ha! - Eh? (Gulps) Ahhh. - (Volcano rumbling) - Huh? Ah! Ahhh! (Pants) (Amaya): Come on! You can do it! Push! Nachi, the floor is lava! (Splash!) (Zaina): Let go of me, you dirty bird! (Calli): Your wish is my command. (Zaina screams) Oh! (Zaina cries) Ay! Ay, not my skin! Ah! (Cries) No! No, not my skin! No! (Cries) (Sighing) Hmm. ♪ The sun waits up for us ♪ ♪ We're seeing colours ♪ ♪ No longer walking in the dark ♪ ♪ It's never too late... ♪ (Calli): You guys are safe! Oh, fantastic! (Laughs) It's so good to see you. Nobody messes with the two of us. (Xochi): You mean the four of us. Ohhh. We made it. (Sniffs) Hmm. Huh? What?! (Animals): Ooooh! - (Xochi): Wow! - (Animals gasp in amazement) (Hopeful music plays) (Cocopa): Nachi! (Nachi): Huh? Cocopa! Where have you been? Did you find the answer to your question? I went on this journey in search of a family and I've learned I've always had one. (Birds screech) (Exciting music) Oh! On your left, you can see three of the four heroes of Xo. (Calli): Ommmm... (Xochi): Oh! Oh, meditation? I love meditation! Mmmmmmmmm. (All scream) Anything else on the agenda for today? - Whoo! - (Laughter) Yay! Go, go, go! (Pako's mother): Pako, mi amor! - (Pako): Mom!
