Brazil sauce! Go for it! She's happy with her gyros! - Michael Jackson. - Bootleg version! Look at this clown! Off in 10 min. Vega? - Gotta go! - And leave me with these losers? Not into it? - Aminata, you've changed! - Not like you! You're at that Arab's beck and call. Bullshit! I tame whities. - Morjana's Arab. - Same thing! - Erwan! - What, sweetie? Did he move? - You move. Take off! - I'm so nuts about her! Plus, he smiles! Totally tamed. If you don't want us to graffiti, we can stream a flick - just you and me. A beer, please. I gotta go soon. My mom goes to work at 4 a.m. I gotta watch the kids. Not all our folks are on the dole! - I'm sick of paupers. - Listen to him! Are you kidding, you Portuguese bum? There's more grease in your hair than on my fries! I swear, last time he got all uppity. I ring the bell, his bald old man answers. He's like, "See Ben's 'Pursan' carpet." I look down and there's just this cruddy old linoleum. He's like, "No, Ben make 'Pursan' carpet." Then I see his mom's ratty old carpetbag purse. Hey, Bintou! Gonna see Morjana later? Yeah, maybe. Will Amélie be there? No way! You know me, guys. - I know what he's gonna say. - You know me! Ako, don't hurt him! You're a pain in the ass! He has to be told. She doesn't love you anymore. It's over! It's been 2 months. Get over it! Eat something! It'll perk you up. She doesn't love you! But I've got something for you. Know my cousin? She's free! She's all yours. He forgot to mention that his cousin looks like 50 Cent with a weaving. No way! He'd never go with a black chick. He's scared of getting AIDS. That's your problem! No, wait! He can't play around. "Wakanda Forever!" Remember? Shut your trap, or we'll have big problems. And you, start by wearing T-shirts of bands you actually listen to! Name one Ramones tune! Just one title... then I'll buy you gyros all year. You'd better take out a loan! You don't know her appetite! Later, guys! Tell her to call me, okay? Hey, girlie! Know how much that can cost you? Go on, go home! That's just where I'm going. Sorry... TILT YOUR HEAD, BASTARD - Hi, Bintou! - Hello, Mrs. Coquelin. Call me Irène. - We're not strangers! - Okay. I'm looking for Morjana. She's in radiology. Why don't you get a job here? - Don't you want a summer job? - No. Hey, Black girl! Hey, Arab! What did Miss Gossip wanna know? If I wanted a hospital job. You faint at the sight of your Tampax! That was just once! Anyway, you don't need cash. I don't have a mommy and daddy to pay the rent. Sure, I need cash! Now that Home Depot locks up the spray paint. That was my last client. - Guess what happened? - Tell me. A guy on a dirt bike leapt off a car hood - and broke his leg. - What? What jerks, I swear! But that means that now it's the weekend! Let's call the white chick. Yeah? Okay, on my way. I'm Loïc and I love to cook... Amélie... The earphones. Not when we're all together. Well, I'm leaving. Can you help me? Pad Thai and wraps. - Can I come with you? - No. Helping doesn't mean doing it for him. Really? I sure wish you'd have done it for me. Hey, give it a rest now! Listen, Amélie, maybe you goof off at school, flunk courses and will never graduate... Maybe you get away with that! Maybe we pick you up at the precinct at 4 a.m. because of your graffiti. Maybe you smoke on the sly - in your room, like you just did. - No way. I can smell it. You're exhausting. Stop, will you? I'm so sick of your fighting. Calm down. You okay? It's late, angel. - Where you going? - Just next door, to Morjana's. - I'm not afraid. - Be careful! Don't worry. Let her take her teen crisis and go. Don't forget your smokes! NO DUMPING DEMOLITION ORDER ELEVATOR Permanently Out of Order - Boo! - Shit! You scared me. Took you long enough. You coulda left the door open! I couldn't bring my new cans. If my parents saw me, they'd know I was coming here. They're busting my balls! You're lucky to have 'em. - Ready? - Yeah. Let's go before Blackie eats all the chips! How can you dance while eating all that shit? It's genetic. Like you stealing cars. - Trying to piss me off? - Wanna battle? Go for it! By the way, Amélie, I saw Farid. - He wants you to call him. - Who gives a shit? - It's just a message from your ex. - Stick it up your ass! Where's your brother? I could go for some grass. No idea. Think he tells me anything? They don't sleep in bunk beds, like at your house. Petty bourgeois! Gimme a break! That's dumb. - I'd love a joint! - You'd love to see him, period. You serious? You owe him too much bread. The bastard's not even a dealer! No, he just makes you pay. - That's not funny. - Take it easy! Here... - I was keeping it for later. - Thanks. You pissed? Don't call me bourgeois. Babe, your folks moved. You're in another category now. - 200 yards away? - But in a cute little house, nice and calm. And what's your problem? When are we invited over? Ashamed of us? So she can burn joint holes in my folks' sofa? No, thanks! Shall we sign it? BAM! Thanks, girls. What's this? Kandy Krush? Is that some guy? More like a woman. - What? - Aicha Kandisha. Aicha what? It's a famous legend in Morocco. What's the story, in a nutshell? In a nutshell? She's the ghost of a beautiful woman who destroys men. If she's called to seek revenge on you or you cross her in the night, she'll drive you insane and kill you. - How do you call her? - With a pentagram. - A what? - A star of Satan. - Or a Ouija board. - A what? You are so dense. "A what?" A Ouija board! We played it on our field trip. Must've been another black chick. Anyway, you all look alike. Filthy racist. And call her 5 times, like in the movies! That's scary... Wanna try? Aicha Kandisha, Aicha Kandisha... See? Nothing happened! We shoulda called Aicha Conchita, the ghost of a cleaning lady. Aicha Conchita, leave your grave and come clean up my shit! She's so dumb! Shit! You're such a pain! This is freaking me out. Let's take off. Wanna sleep over tonight? No, I'm dead! Plus, your sofa's lousy. Me, too. I need sleep. My mom's waking me up at dawn to go grocery shopping. - Everybody sleeps at home. - Abdel, you scared me! - Where were you? - At the gym. We just finished our thing for mom and dad. I'll stop by to see it. Don't worry, I'll pay you next week. I've got a babysitting job... - What's so funny? - Babysitting? Who'd trust you with their kids? Your mother! Every week, during her orgy. Stop being so infantile! Don't bug my sister with your orgy bullshit. Don't be so bitchy to her. And smoking's bad for your health. Go on, take off, Totally Spies! - Stop laughing. - "Stop laughing!" If I knew Abdel was there, I'd have spent the night at Morjana's. It's nice here, with all the little flower pots. It's great. Which house is yours? 19. - It's right here. - It's so cute. I know. - Give me a tour? - Sure, at 2 a.m.? Sure. "Here's my folks' room... Oops, they're screwing." Idiot! And there's my old man. Coming home from the factory in his fancy company car. - We didn't do too bad on that bus. - Wow, killer. If he knew... - Don't tell. - No! Bintou, what are you doing out so late? Hello, Mr. Bintou. Hello, Amélie. Why aren't you in bed yet? I dunno, we're on vacation. Not everyone. Well, goodnight, girls. Goodnight. Don't be too late, honey. And be careful not to wake your mother. I'll be right in, Dad. - See you tomorrow. - Yep. - Tomorrow afternoon, on the roof? - Sure. Shit, I'm gonna get soaked. - Farid? - Why won't you call me back? - It's been a month. - There's a reason! You can't just leave! Sure I can! I don't love you anymore. You're violent. Plus, you're wasted. - It's too late. You disgust me. - Stop! - I love you! - What are you doing? I hate you! Understand? Shit! Get lost! Get off me! Get the hell off me! What are you doing? Farid! You bastard! Get over here! Son of a bitch! Aicha Kandisha... Aicha Kandisha... Where the hell are you? Have you heard about Farid? I spoke to Irène. She said he died instantly. He didn't suffer. I think Ako knows a guy who knows the guy who was driving. - Ako! - Stop. Why are you so weird? What's going on? Last night, when I left Bintou... - What? - What did you say about Farid? The driver said Farid was running like he was being chased. There was nothing the guy could do... We know the rest. Go play now. And he was thrown across the street. Know why I was always goalkeeper? I kick like hell. Run and fetch! I'm not a dog. And you owe me 20 bucks! - Where's the ball? - Up your ass! Under the coffee table. No, babe, I'm at the supermarket. - Can I write? - Sure. The cans are in the cooler. Hey, girls! There's a party at the pool tonight. Yeah, yeah. - Can I come? - No. - Yes. - We'll see. Write a little further off. So? What last night? Last night, when I left you, Bintou... I ran into Farid. He was completely wasted and tried to rape me. - What? - Quiet. He tried, nothing happened. Filthy bastard. What did you do? I bit his lip. I think I bit a piece off. I'm not surprised he ran away. - Why didn't you tell? - Who? - The cops! - 'Cause nothing happened! What good would that do? Still, he deserved it! I don't wanna be buried In a pet cemetery I don't want to live my life again Admit you dig it! I'll never wear that T-shirt again. Play it for Aminata. I'm sure she'll dig it! - You're right. - Go on. Seriously? Bintou really dug that? Yeah, she wouldn't give the earphones back. Hear that, buddy? Your mom's not a rock fan. Luckily, uncle Ben will protect you from the worst R&B crap. Yeah! Take off, Satan! You're making him kick me. He digs it. Leave my son alone, shithead! Antoine? Didn't Amélie tell you not to come? - She said, "We'll see." - Gimme a bite or I'll tell. Who? My parents? I'm getting a snack. That midget made me really hungry. - Want something? - Yeah, a drink. Like a Diet Coke. Yes, mistress. No problem, mistress. And your bro just got here. So, how's Amélie? Not that we're gonna miss that asshole, Farid. He was a jerk, like his big brother. Is she holding up? Don't worry about her, she's fine. Trust me. I think it's coming. It hurts, it hurts! Call the firemen! Hurry, she's in labor! - What's the number? - Step on it! It hurts so bad! Amélie! Make the call! Amélie! You okay or what? You drunk? Amélie? What came over Ben to do that? I dunno. Some people said he leapt into the fire. Is that true, Amélie? Amélie, where you going? Amélie! She'll be back. "She may be beautiful and seductive, "or gigantic and monstrous." See, the last site says the same thing. Or almost. Down to the details. Some say she has the hoofs of a camel, a goat... But they all say that during her lifetime, she fought the Portuguese occupation in the 16th century. That her beauty lured the soldiers and then... she killed them. Like some sort of patriotic serial killer? What's the link between the ghost and Ben's death? How do you explain her continuing power? That when you call, her ghost appears? In deserted places. At night. Just like I said last time. Come on! I'm sure there are 400 forums where idiots say they saw her. Honestly, Amélie, do you really think you summoned a ghost from your bathroom? I have no idea! But I really meant it. Not like when we were kidding around. Still, that can't make a ghost come. And if you really bit off half of Farid's lip... he ran like crazy and got hit by a car. - It was an accident. - Was Ben an accident, too? Yeah. I dunno, a coincidence. Bad luck always comes in threes! - I've had it. - Where you going? Home. And you should, too. If only for him. He'll be better off in bed. Wait, I'm coming. I'm hungry. Go straight to bed. I'll bring you something to eat. Don't let Dad see us coming in at this hour. Especially when he finds out what happened. - Who's that? - Don't look. Salam alaykum? Go to bed. Don't make a sound. Stay in your room, okay? - Okay. - Go on. Shit! See through my eyes... Look... See what I did for you... What the hell is that? Ako! Open the door! Ako's dead. I saw her do it. I saw it, as if I were there. She chased Farid. She pushed Ben into the fire. She threw Ako off the ledge. Three deaths in 2 days. That's no coincidence! And she'll kill again. - We have to call the cops. - And say what? That Amélie summoned a demon and now it's a suicide fest? - Do you really believe that? - Don't you? According to legend, she only attacks men. Cool! Then we're not in danger. The people we love are. Before you saw his mean streak, you were crazy about Farid! And you always had a little crush on Ben. And Ako was like our little brother. We have to warn the others. Hold on... I'm sorry. The imam doesn't wish to speak to you. Why not? He gave no reason. He just said no. You said yes on the phone. We must speak to him. We have a problem. My parents always came here with their problems. I remember your parents. They were good people. But you must understand. You're the rector. Do something. Sorry, but you have to leave now. What the fuck? If one more person dies, it's all your fault, asshole! We should've gone to the cops. Come on, let's go. Even on North African illuminati websites, nobody says Kandisha kills the men who hang out with the one who called her. Let's cut the crap, huh? - Back to reality! - Really, guys? Three deaths aren't convincing enough? Bintou, people die every day. And forget Amélie's visions. If you smoked all the shit she has, you'd see goat hoofs, too. Remember what Dad used to say? That Kandisha was in the cellar? That was just so we wouldn't play there. I tell you, it's just old-country bullshit. France has the Lady in White. We have Aicha Kandisha. Period. So stop busting my balls with this shit. I'll tell you one thing, then this conversation is over. Our parents died right in front of us. Okay? I prayed my heart out but I never brought them back. Ever since, I don't believe in God or jinns or Santa Claus! Hold on! If you believe in Pokémon... They say, if you held a ceremony to invoke a ghost, do the exact same thing backwards and say take off. - Basically. - A revocation? Whatever... I have no idea. Perfect. Now you're all set. You did it in the bathroom? Do that again, then you'll know. - Have fun. - You leaving? I gotta see my chick, my son. What do you say, Abdel? - Is Mourad still open? - Yeah. I'm going for tacos. You're going out? I spend my life at the gym. Do you think some old Arab dame scares me? If I get kicked by a hoof, a dodge, hook to the chin... and game over. Let 'em go. This is between us. You have to make the pentagram again. But I did it in blood. That's disgusting. Why'd you do that? I don't know. It was a reflex. Now what'll you use? I know exactly what I'll use. We've always been on the same cycle. Go on, turn around. This is when things get tense. We're not gonna kill your brother's rabbit? An animal sacrifice is obligatory. - Don't kill it. - Let's find another way. Something softer, like suffocation. Please, don't! Now the water has to purify everything. Aicha Kandisha, I called you. I thank you for answering me. Now I release you. Aicha Kandisha, I called you. I thank you for answering me. Now I release you. I called you. I thank you for answering me. Now I release you. I called you, I... Look... How are things back home this summer? Chop it up fine. So now you believe us? If I'm doing this, it's only in memory of your parents. Where you going? Not before 2 p.m. - Is this your place? - No, come in. Sit down. Sheikh. You won't find what's in there on the internet. Ahmed Ibn Fahlan doesn't speak French. So I'll translate. Near the spring, at the Hmadcha Brotherhood sanctuary, in the Zerhoun grotto, lies a body... Aicha Kandisha's body. A beautiful woman whose husband was killed by the Portuguese. In vengeance, she killed many soldiers Once captured, six henchmen tortured her right up to her very last breath. Her martyred soul bonded with a jinn... a demon. Perpetuating her vengeance beyond death. When invoked, she demands the lives of six men. In guise of an offering. The summoner sees her abominations with their own eyes. There are two ways to stop her curse. The first is to invoke the demon and to exorcise her. The second is... But what's the second? There is no second way. - You said... - The first one will work! Stand up. Khatem Souleyman. Is that what you drew instinctively? The Seal of Solomon. Who is he? Ahmed Ibn Fahlan is a former Raquy, an exorcist imam. He's been banished, excommunicated. For a major sin. Witchcraft. Sit down. Listen to me! Hold on tight. Never break the circle. Under any circumstances. Understand? Repeat after me. Oh, Lalla Aicha. God is my lord and your lord. God is the lord of jinns and men. Reside forever in the Seal of Souleyman. Power and strength are only in God. And obey your lord. Reside forever in the Circle of Souleyman! Reside forever in the Circle of Souleyman. Power and strength are only in God. And obey your lord. And obey your lord. Don't break the circle! Hold on tight! Hold on! Reside forever in the Circle of Souleyman. Repeat after me. Sheikh... He needs to rest. You do the same. It's over now. It's finished. What? Will you sleep with me? Why? I need you. Where's my rabbit? Don't worry, we'll find him. If he doesn't come back, I'll buy you another. Why aren't you in bed yet? Aren't you eating your fries? No, help yourself. Thanks. Anyway, I'm going to bed soon. I'm exhausted. Find a good job that doesn't break your back. And finding a good job begins by not watching this shit. Goodnight. Abdel... Abdel... Shit! Pick up! Look... The police want to ask you a few questions, honey. Ten minutes, at most. Wait for me here. I'll be right back. Your friends are here. It didn't work. My brother's dead. We have to see the sorcerer. Please! - That's not possible. - Why not? Ahmed Ibn Fahlan died tonight. That ceremony took all his strength. And for nothing. Tell us the second way. No. What do you mean, no? She'll come back, you know that. To kill two more of our loved ones. You must die. What? The one who invoked her must die to stop the curse. She'll die to save the souls that Kandisha covets... and be reincarnated as her. Daddy... - What are you doing? - Let go of me! It's the only way to stop it! Come here. I'm sorry. She's moving toward you, Amélie. She'll come for your father. Or my brother. But before that... Girls! To what do I owe this welcome? - Nothing, everything's fine. - Okay. Have a nice evening, girls. So... do you still want a tour? I'm thirsty. Want a drink? No, I'm fine. Daddy! Daddy! We've run away long enough. Now we're gonna confront her. Wake up! Get dressed and come with me. Why? I'm so scared. We're all scared. I'm not scared. Me, neither. Come on, let's go, girls. I'm dying for a cigarette. She's here. Now! Go on, do it! Never break the circle! Oh, Aicha Kandisha! Submit to your lord. Submit to the power of Allah. And reside forever in the Seal of Solomon. Ya Kandisha. Stand and serve Allah! Close your eyes! Close your eyes! Go! Take me, demon! No! Go! Aicha Kandisha. Aicha Kandisha... Subtitles by Rosemary Ricchio Subtitling: ECLAIR
