MURDER IN PACOT Doctors are amazed by the condition of this little girl who has been rescued after 3 days buried under rubble. Although very approximate, the numbers are heavy and still mounting. These are estimates put forward by the authorities, but we must remain cautious. The hospitals are struggling to cope with the numbers needing care. This child is treated at last by a nurse after terrifying days. Everyone else always knows before us! - How many? - More than 100,000. No one knows for sure. Wash your hands! The water is still clean. I'm going out. Sorry for mentioning this... Do you think Joseph will come back? I'm no good at household chores. No one is good at household chores. If he isn't dead, he'll come back. Here. I found some money under the mattress, and another of your shirts. I think Joseph was stealing from us. Wouldn't you have too? Everyone steals anyways. You should go out. You'll see, nothing is in its place. The streets, the people, the store... everything is destroyed. The town is dead. The town is dead! Engineer Leonetti. I'm here for the... What? We're here to assess your house. You must be kidding! You have no choice, sir. Red! Sir! This is habitable, but mind the balcony. Habitable? Yes. Because of that, I should put red all over. Red? Red means "demolish". But, well, times are hard, so I'll put yellow. Put yellow! Hey! You! Come down! You're getting on my nerves, you know! - Piss off! - Let go! Watch it! Yellow is "repairable". But you have to do the repairs fast though. Fast? What? Well, clear up, fill in and strengthen. It's up to you. Otherwise? We'll tear down... everything. Here, sign this. You're on the list. And careful, there'll be more aftershocks. I'll come back to inspect it. If no work's been done, I'll raze it. When? When? I don't know. But I'll be back. Has everyone been evacuated? Yes. Why? Didn't you have a dog or...? No. Something smells. I can't smell anything. Maybe I smell it everywhere. This smell is following me. Let's go! The white guy said let's go. You're given a job and you fool around... I can't sleep. Me neither. We need money. Money? Yes. For the repairs. Otherwise... they'll demolish it. We have to let the apartment. Rent it out? Who to? Who? We'll find someone. I don't want families with kids and stuff! Of course not! We can't rent it out in this state. I know. Will you come sleep with me? I'll join you. Is anyone home? Is anyone home? Sister! Wake up! Jesus is knocking at your door. There's still time to repent. - Yes, repent! - Who are you? What do you want? Servants of the Lord. We are bringing His word to Babylon. We are living in darkness. Did you know? Renounce sins, rape, fornication, adultery, the love of money! - I'm to blame for this disaster? - Yes. Mark 4, verse 9. "And he said, "Who hath ears to hear, let him hear." Renounce alcohol, lies, anger! God did not like those who died? John 5, verse 19. "The whole world lieth in wickedness." I told you I'm not interested! I don't want it! Leave me alone. You are lying to yourself. - Go away! - But Christ knows. - He knows! - Come back, sister. He can see you. Three madwomen came by. There are loads in town. They're going round the neighborhoods. Is this all that's left? We'll have to get more tomorrow. I've found someone for the apartment. Already? A white guy. He's moving in tomorrow. A foreigner? But nothing's ready. I also found some plaster in town. On the black market. Plaster? To fill in the holes. The worst of them anyways. Got a better idea? Shit! Are you OK? Fine! I was washing saucepans, cleaning utensils. That's good. Carry on. OK. But what about the rest? I'll never be as good as Joseph. You'll have to be. We're the servants now. Carry on. Carry on. DAY ONE - ...for the curtain... - I have everything. I have more boxes. Right... Excuse me. Don't worry, the inspectors were here. They certified this part. It's sound. I'm working on it. Right? Mind your belongings. The neighborhood isn't safe. At least I have a home till I find something better. Habitable houses are rare, you know, and people are scared. For sure. I'm glad I found this. Thank you. Honey! Honey, I'm going! What are you doing? I found your old camera. What should I do with it? You can sell it to some foreigners. It must be worth something. How much longer are you going to dig up crap? You want to throw out everything? Look at how we're living! What the hell can you do with it? Wait for me. No. I never learnt how to scream. In my family, you didn't do that. What's her name? Andremise. Sleep. DAY TWO Can you hand me the wood? Yes, of course. Here. What are we going to do? About what? About the smell. It doesn't bother me. I don't believe you. It wakes me in the morning... Stop! I'll see what I can do. I'll find a product. Yeah, right. Hello! Hello. We've plenty of water. I can give you some. No thanks. Right. But if you need anything, you just have to ask. It's good. In my hometown, we always have verbena tea for shock. Thanks. Where are you from? A town in the south, where things have changed a lot. The town used to belong to a few people, now that it's ruined, it belongs to everyone. How about you? I was born here but I grew up abroad. Do you work? Alex is trying to find me a job in an NGO. The nation's youth will end up in NGOs. - Excuse me. - No. I understand you. But emergencies must be dealt with. The country today is like my hometown. It belongs to everyone now it's ruined. If Alex didn't help me, what would I do? I'll leave with him after. That's the way it is. You must excuse her. She's on edge. She lost a brother. I lost... We lost a child. I'm so sorry. I didn't know. Coming? Thank you. Don't mention it. You're not used to it, huh? - No, I'm not. - Anything can be learned. Joseph used to do it. Yes. Everything can be learned. I want to ask you something. Do you think he's sincere? He says he'll take me with him. With men, you can never be sure. You have more experience. Well, I say that... And I want to change my name. Jennifer. Don't you think it's pretty? Yes. It is pretty... Jennifer. Yes. Why not? Let me introduce... Jennifer. Alex says back home it's on both cheeks. So... I'm practicing. Hang on, don't move. Lift your head up. No, not like that. Look serious. Do you love me? Of course I love you. How do you love me? I love you like my wife. Like my daughter. But you don't have children! But if I did! Yes. Wait. Don't move. Tell me again. I love you. - Again! - I love you. I love you. - Again. - I love you. - Say it again. - I love you. - I love you. - Again. I love you. I'm Joseph. I used to work here. Downstairs! In the shed. Excuse me... - I'm pleased to see you. - You came back! I came to see how you were. My daughter's fine, thank God, but the neighborhood's in ruins. I've lost many people. Hello, sir. Hello. You came back? You found the shirt? I'm not a thief, you know. I gave it you, but I need it now. I've nothing to wear. Would you like some tea? - Verbena tea? - I'll make it. No, leave it. I'll make it. I'm moving to the provinces. Here... there are too many dead. My eldest daughter has already left. I put her in a truck. Tomorrow, it's my turn. I'm going to Fort Libert√©, but I don't know what I'll do. You could stay on here. I'm tired of being a servant. Sorry, I'm not saying that because of you. It's just how life is. A beautiful girl! But life will break her, so she's fighting. If I found a messenger's job in an NGO, I wouldn't leave. Sorry. Stop moaning. Anyways, that's how it is. You're a free man. You've started over? Yes. And the boy? What about the boy? Did you return him to his parents? I liked him a lot. He was lucky to be with you. Have you told the family? We were his family. We raised him like a son. We wanted the best for him because we can't take them all in. We wanted to rescue him... Him. And this horror... This horror which rose from the bottom of earth and covered us. She's mad at me. He wanted to play in the street. To go out. She'll always be mad at me. Hello! The shitty bastard... I don't get it. He takes me for his maid. He thinks he can mess with Haitian girls! Never! He thinks he'll find loads of girls and free pussy! The son of a bitch! And this other one who never picks up his phone... I'm leaving. I'm leaving, madame. For the road. One day... maybe... DAY 3 Good luck! Mr Alex! Don't you smell anything? It's the same everywhere. I brought you some supplies. Cereal? Thank you. For the unpleasant smell, what do you intend to do? Walter, mind your own business! Go! I'll mention it to my husband. Where are you going? Where do you think you're going? To see my sister. Who? Andremise. Jennifer? Andremise. Let me help you. No thanks. I'm fine. I insist. Thank you. How many today? We're not allowed to count anymore. Yes, I understand. Is your wife all right? OK. We're getting by. Good. That's good. Would you like some tea? No thank you. Wait! Yes? No. Nothing. Well? Were you able to get to the roof? Jennifer told me there was a leak. A leak? Honey, I already told you. The towels are soaking wet. It's my fault. Too much work. I can't do everything. But I'm making progress. - You haven't even said hello! - Hello, honey. Goodbye... boss. Goodbye. Would you like to come for dinner? You and your wife, I mean. You don't mind, do you, honey? No... See you tonight. We'll be expecting you. Thank you. I found this. I saw Ronald. How is he? All right. And Joanne? You don't ask after people you don't see. It's the new rule of politeness. Joanne died in a supermarket. It's screwed for your football match. It doesn't matter. Anyways, they've invited us over. It's true it's a strong smell. Tomorrow, I'll try to buy a product. I miss him. He was sweet. Not all the time! Yes, but on the whole, he was sweet. Yes. Do you regret it? Adopting him? No! Even if mixing backgrounds isn't easy. You sound like an old fool! Of course it was a good idea to give him a home! What would've become of him? He'd have ended up like those youths in town. Like Jennifer. You'll always be mad at me. I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at you! I'm mad at everyone. At these times! At myself! At us, who are lost. And you... aren't you mad at yourself? Aren't you mad at yourself? Did you like my "lambi"? It takes ages to prepare, but Alex loves it. You said you were from the South? From Pestel. Well, that's where I was born. It's the birthplace of many great poets. A great writer comes from that village. We'll go there, honey. I've no one there anymore. Have you been to Europe? Yes. Quite a few times. We met over there. What's love... If I cannot love you What's love... If it makes us cry Sweet dreams of youth... For us, they weren't dreams. But things escape you very quickly here. Confrontation with reality. It's merciless. We dance, dance, dance Carefree, we believe in our good fortune In our good fortune We dance, dance, dance... Enough! Darling... We try to cling on to what we have then the earth trembles, and the little we thought we had disappears under the rubble. Darling... With the wind... With the wind, you know, you'll fly away You'll forget the voyage You won't hear the voice Can't you see you're annoying everyone? You criticize everything. When the heart fades The body doesn't apprehend, the body... Why don't you tell them about your village? About your illiterate grandma, your alcoholic dad, that your mum doesn't speak to you. OK? It's a deal. You whites come to get rich while pretending to do good deeds. We have a few scraps and we pretend you are saving us. Everyone follows their conscience. Stop taking us for fools! Honey... valuable words... "The inexhaustible breath of my Creole Babel, "which blows onto my misfortunes. "Between life and death, "I remain the child of yesterday, crudely naked, "suddenly becoming a strange adult cloaked in misfortune, "an adult covered in gashes, "to weather the torment of unbearable nights, "the time of bad wounds turned blue by hideous scars. "Infantile old man, "crazy adult, "I dance "and counter-dance, "my madness torn through wanting to commit again "guilty love. "Incorrigibly, I love you "and I love you again." DAY FOUR Hello! You didn't leave. No. I can't yet. - You've come back? - No. I haven't come back. I won't come back. I just wanted to help you before I left. Help us? You're sick! - Are you nuts? - Liar! Bastard! Stop that. Stop that right now! Help us how? I'd like to find the boy's body for you. - What body? - But, sir, I thought... Don't think anything! The boy was returned to his family, period! - And we're not going... - Stop! Joseph isn't to blame. There's no point lying anymore. Don't you see it's blackmail, It's a business. Like the guys who offer to help the families promising to bring back bodies for money. No. - Not Joseph! - Fear not. It would be a comfort. - And we owe it to him. - Out of the question! You want it all to collapse? And I've a white tenant. He's paying the bills. And besides... imagine the spectacle if you do find it. Folks see corpses every day, if that's what scares you. Forget it. Already? You're giving up? My husband won't be back anytime soon, you know. I'm taking a break. Do something. They're in a pack, aggressive... Now they've eaten corpses, they're fearless. Go away! Go away! DAY FIVE I'm going on a mission in the provinces. I'll be back tomorrow night. Andremise... Jennifer is staying here. We must help one another. We must help one another. Who's he think he is! Do you think the supports will hold? I'm no expert but... Sorry about the noise. I have friends over. Cousins. Friends and cousins. Would you like to join us? Certainly not, Jennifer. Go on, come over. You're not that old! This is the first time in history that rich and poor share places. Everyone's lying on the ground. Let's dance! I don't want to. In this country, women like you don't dance with men like us. You have no right! Can you smell a strange smell? No. You've become like us. Insensitive to odors. Come on, make an effort. Let's dance. It isn't me you want. It's what you think I am. And what do I think you are? An ageing enemy. No. Why? For no reason. Go back to your friends. Is that you? Who else would it be? Coffee is hard to come by. She threw a party. They brought me a beer. Someone's hanging around up there. Whoever the man is, she can't help screaming. DAY SIX Why are you doing this? Why are you helping me? I like things done properly. And you don't know how. Alex is back today. His mission in the provinces ended this morning. What does he do? He helps. That's what he always says: "I help." And he tells me about his problems with his colleagues. They fight each other with words. "Strategy", "priority", "process", "cluster"... and above all, "absorption capacity." I like Alex. But I don't believe in what he does. For me, it's laponyet. Yes. No, I have no faith in this. What do you want me to say? Tell me you're going to stop. Stop what? Stop playing the white man's whore. He says he'll take me with him. He won't take you. They're all the same. They promise and do nothing. Right... Come and live with me. I'll sort things so you can come. Stop. Stop! He sniffs me all the time to check for odors. Anyways, why is it you all want to screw me? Like that guy who watches me, with sex in his eyes! Come back inside. Stop sulking! Come back, honey. I'm going in. I guess I might as well... Anything can be learned. There's not much to wash. Plus it's expensive. DAY SEVEN How old was he? Who? The kid. His name was Joel. He's beautiful. You're beautiful. A beautiful family. Now you've lost everything, what do you live for? I'm going to show you something. You shouldn't do that. Why not? They're his trophies. Every day he brings back new ones. He's proud of them! I'm going. Are you there? Have you found anything? Answer me, please! Where are you going? There's a meeting today. A meeting? The downtown store owners want to get organized. It's a waste of time. But time... we have plenty. I'll have to go out too sometime. You're bleeding. Mind your own business! You've just left everything as it is. Hey! Where are you going? Come back! Why are you whispering? I've got a tenant. Well, he's going to have to go! You don't get it! It's rented. It's rented? It's a rat trap! There are aftershocks every day. When it collapses on his head, he'll be in a fine way, and so will you! What did I tell you last time? You can see I've started to reinforce it! It took me ages to find those posts! It's simple. It's green, yellow or red. And your place is red now! So I'm calling in the bulldozers. - You see? - Hey! You'll wake him up. And this one too! How can I repair it if you break everything? Break everything? Everything's already broken! You've dug here! What do you mean? You think I have time to do that? I do repairs every day! Every day, for God's sake! And you come hassle me with your pots of paint! Fuck it! Fuck you! Is that better? Do you like this? Your bulldozers... Shove them up your ass! They can come now! You're inhumane. Inhumane! Let's go! You're bleeding. - You'll have to leave. - Who? Me? The house is condemned. It's going to be demolished. I'm surprised it hasn't collapsed already. And Alex doesn't notice a thing! It should've been demolished already. I haven't found a solution yet. - I need a few days. - A few days? What if it collapses on us? It won't collapse. It's bullshit. Administrative standards. I need a few days! Just a few days. Please... don't tell Alex. I'll see. Will you stay with him? I'm free. I do as I please and I go with whoever I want. What about me? You take me for a whore! You don't see, it doesn't count with the white guy. Why don't you tell him the house is condemned? Because you want his money? So who's the whore now, huh? It's time for the bulldozers to come. It smells bad here! Won't you be late for your meeting? Are you there already? My husband has gone out! What are you doing? Can't you see? We're cleaning. What are you cleaning? Are you the police? Are you the UN? We're cleaning. We're paid to. That's all. Shit! They're so crazy in this country! DAY EIGHT You promised. No... It's hell down there. It simply isn't possible. You said you'd get him out! It's too dangerous. One blow could bring it all down. You're dashing off! Madame, please understand me. Let me say goodbye. Your kind-heartedness was just a sham! You look smart. - Why? - Bill Clinton's visit. Heard of him? A former president. Haitian? A white guy. I was kind of surprised you'd put on a tie. You're so susceptible in this country! You're always on the defensive. Can you help me? My hands are dirty. Thanks a lot! I'll never understand. People here are so fragile, sensitive, quick-tempered. Always moaning, wanting to fight and destroy everything! Maybe it's none of my business, but fuck it! For how many centuries have you been independent? You can't always blame others! When will you get out of this mess, and fend for yourselves? Yesterday I sent a 30-truck convoy to the countryside. Attacked! - What's wrong with you? - Stop! Shit! Go on! Just stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop that! Get out of my sight! Tonight I'll give you money and you'll go! Sorry. No... I'm sorry. So you're really going? I can't do anything more. I know. It's hard that's all. Joseph came to say goodbye. That's nice. Farewell, sir. Madame... Thanks again, Joseph! Thanks for everything. What are you doing? My brother... We're going clubbing. Your brother? I've lots of brothers. Come in, Luc. Have a seat. I'll get changed. We're going dancing. Scotch? What do you do? Same as you. I help. What does that mean? You deal? Yes. Like you. I'm taking her with me. We're getting married. Brother and sister? We're getting married in my hometown. We're starting over. I'm taking the boat tonight. She'll join me when she's done. Shall we go then? How do you like my dress? Don't wait for me to eat. I'll be home late. Let go of me! Everything's dead. You, me... this town, this country. I said, let go of me! I'm not mad at you. I don't care whether you're mad at me or not. We were animals before. We're animals now. And that's it. The little we had... And what did we have? A house, two cars... A child! No! He wasn't ours. Not ours. - We wanted to do good. - Stop! Stop. I'm going to be sick again. Come on, let's go in. Leave me alone. Let me be! I don't want to wake up the bastard up there. I came to get my things. No problem. Come sit down. We can talk. What about? Are you in such a hurry? You know, I struggled too when I was young. It was during the dictatorship. I was robbed of my youth. But you were on the right side though. But you are free. Free to die of desire, yes. Maybe. We've no choice, we have to make it. That's what I've decided to do. You've helped me by making me see that. That I had to react so as not to have a life full of corpses, like you. Do you know how many people I've lost in this disaster? And you, you complain! You rich people, if you become poor, your entire world collapses: love, dreams, everything! The rich are so fragile. Yes, we are. I want to live too! What do you want? You. I want... you! Go back to your wife. I had forgotten what real desire felt like. I didn't know anymore. And it has to be me? Alex, open the door! Alex, let me in, please. Alex, let me in, honey! Alex, let me in! Alex, honey! Open the door. Let me pass. Does he fuck you well? Does he know how? What's the other guy's name? It's him, isn'it? What's his name? Enough! You hate your wife? Or she's lost interest? It's because of the boy. It's because of the boy you left to die! Shut up! No one will hear you anyway. It's you who doesn't want to hear. You want something else. You want a real girl, who knows her body! I want to show you how a real woman does it. No... Don't do it. DAY NINE God called the light 'day', and the darkness He called 'night'. Evening came and morning came: the first day.
