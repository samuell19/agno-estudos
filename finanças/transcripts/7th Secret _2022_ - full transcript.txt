There are 10 secrets that can destroy a marriage... but it was the seventh secret that caught my attention. Failure to disclose a kinky desire or a fetish to your spouse before marriage. Guilty. I got you something. Tastes better than it looks, but it's chocolate, your favorite. Oh, it's adorable. It looks great. Come here. You wanna order Chinese tonight? We could eat in bed, watch "Mad Men" reruns. Perfect. Hmm. Hmm. Mm-mmm. Good morning, Kristopher. Hi, Mom. To what do I owe the honor? Oh, just picking up some last-minute things for Kailee's baby shower, and I thought I'd say hello before your trial. Did Brooke RSVP? What do you think? Hmm. She'll be there. Did you buy an appropriate dress for the shower, Marissa? Not yet, but I am looking. What is that? Oh! I made Kris a cupcake. - He loves chocolate. - Chocolate. I know. Ever since he was little, especially the Belgian dark chocolate cream-filled delicacies from Cupcakes Gourmet in Malvern. I packed one in his lunch every Tuesday and Friday since kindergarten. - Didn't I, Kristopher? - Yeah, sure did, Mom. Let's go, boss. All right. Bye, girls. Oh. So what's on your busy agenda today, Marissa? I'm actually working on a new song- Oh, Marissa. - What? - You are so beautiful. Thank you. I'm sure one day... you'll do so much more. Can I ask you a question, sweetheart? It's a good one, I promise. Sure. When are you going to take a good, hard look at yourself? I mean, a really deep look and realize who you are and what you have to offer, then stake your claim on life. Soon. This is... This- No, no, no, no. You know how this works, Jimmy. That is not my problem. You have until Friday. Hey, babe, it's me. Um, I hope your trial is going well. I'm going to pick out the Chinese food, so you don't need to worry about it. I can't wait to see you later. Love you. Bye. Richie, you gotta pay your child support, dawg, for real, they will lock your ass up. Nah, I'm gonna give one of them Jerry Springer test, you know, make sure it's my kid. Make sure it's your kid? You both got faces shaped like horses, dawg. Whose kid could it be? - Fuck you, Danny. - Just kidding, dawg. I'm just kidding. Yo, pay your fucking child support for that horse teeth, motherfucker. I just have a funny-shaped face. I got to piss, bro. Oh. Where are you going? It's for you. Thank you. So you should join me and my boy. Yeah, we got drinks. Oh. No, I... I can't. - I'm sorry. - Hey. It's just one drink. Play nice. Have some fun. - I... I really can't. - Come on. But thank you. You think you're better than me? Take your hand off her. Yo, everything good, man? Everything good? Depends on whether your boy here takes his hand off this lady's arm. Come on, dawg. Listen, he's... he's drunk, man. He didn't know you knew her, all right? Just get him out of my face. Come on. You heard him. - Go. - Go! Get out of here. You okay? You should be careful walking around this park alone, young lady. I'm sure there are... better places for you to watch your videos. I was writing a song. You're a songwriter? Trying to be. I'm sure you're very good. Was that you in the video? I asked you a question. No. I didn't think so. What's your name? Marissa. Marissa, what? Kelly. Marissa Kelly. Thank you so much for helping. Stop by Club Corporal. See me some time. I have a feeling that you might like it. What's Club Corporal? You should be careful walking around this park alone, young lady. You know what happens when you don't focus on your songwriting, Marissa? What are you doing? Hope I was the star of that dream. Actually, Channing Tatum was, but you had a nice cameo in the beginning. Oh, yeah? Oh, God. Stop. Oh, you're funny. You're very funny. You know, that wasn't very nice. - You're obviously right. - All right. You're right. That wasn't very nice, was it? I didn't expect to hear from you so soon, - Marissa. - Oh! Who is that, Dad? A friend. All right. Winner picks where we go to have lunch, all right? You're going down. Is it going to be like that? Well, in that case... Right, so... Oh, man, you're a beast. Is it more some of the spinach you're eating? I hate spinach. Well, then it's the Slade genes. And you're a Slade. What are Slades? Slades are tough as shit. Yeah, yeah! Uh-huh, uh-huh! Uh-huh. When are you gonna lock the door? My sister's a super cop. Nobody would dare mess with me. That's funny. Until you're dead. Pass them out. Liz, I can't just hand out fliers about myself to people. I put something on Facebook, though, that should, that should be enough. Yeah, it's not enough. You have to get out from behind the computer and go meet the people. Liz, I'm not running for office. - I'm singing at a coffeehouse. - Right. And that's all you're gonna do unless you listen to me. I got to go. I'm doing the Carmines Delaney case. Oh, that mafia guy. Yeah, we're close to a RICO indictment. Who's Rico? Pass them out. Okay. Bye. Stop by Club Corporal. See me some time. I have a feeling that you might like it. Wow. You're even hotter when you sweat. Thanks. How's it going? I'm a little distracted lately, but... - Yeah... - It's okay. Or maybe it's time you focus on something else. Like what? Future. I've decided to run for the top seat when Riley's term is up. And the party, is it backing you? Yeah, the money is backing me and the party follows the money, so... So I'm going to be the wife of the youngest district attorney in the history of Philadelphia. Yes, you are. And that's why it's time to take this to the next level. I want us to start a family. I'm... I'm ready, Riss. Um... But I mean, you want to have a baby, don't you? Yeah! Yeah. I... I think so. Maybe. What do you mean, maybe? I just have things, I just have things I wanna do right now. But... I think that... that you are talented as hell. You know that. But... But, what? I mean, we can't put our lives on hold while you chase a dream. Do you know what the odds are of you becoming famous? You know this is not about becoming famous. I'm sorry. What's it about then? Forget it. No. No, no, no, don't forget it. - I want to talk about this. - No, no. You don't get it. So tell me. Babe, look, I want to talk about this. This is important, okay? Look, I gotta go. Later tonight? Can I help you? Hi. No, sorry, I actually... I... I was just curious- Curious about what? Um, I actually just wanted to- You're my 4:00, sweetie. He's upstairs already, okay? I'm going to be here the whole time, he's safe. Don't worry about it. So, uh, did you expect to see a freak show? No. No, not at all. Actually, um, someone... Someone what? Um, someone suggested I stop by. Oh, who suggested you stop by? Me. Of course you did. I'm glad you came. Don't be nervous. Come inside and have a look around. No, no, I, um... I actually have to go. You're with me. It's okay. Um... Valerie's inside, actually, she's got a private session. - It just- - It's okay, Olivia. Relax. - Come in. - It's not okay. I can't. Then why did you, uh... come? Sorry. Hello. Hey, babe, I'm sorry, things didn't come out right. Can we talk about this calmly? You there? Yeah, yeah, I'm here. Hold on, I have another call. Why don't you pick up the wine for Saturday? I was just going to pick it up tomorrow morning. Why don't you pick up now? Please. Hang up the phone. Come inside. Jury is back with the verdict. I have to go. I would like to make a toast. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. To the next District Attorney of Philadelphia. Mm-mmm, mm-mmm. No, I would like to go on the record and state that at this time, I have no interest in running for District Attorney. Bullshit. Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. Okay. All right. Maybe I have a little bit of interest. Just a little bit. - Fuck you, baby! - You got it. That's what I'm talking about right there. - Oh, yeah. - Man, I love this. I love this. Guilty. Guilty.

You know, I know this whole artist rebel thing is part of your little persona, but you can't tell me you don't want a baby. I know better. I never said I didn't want a baby. I just don't want them now. But how long do you think you have? Your biological clock is ticking. Your eggs are old. There. I said it. Okay? Your kid, at this rate, is looking at a stray eye at best. - Lovely visual. - Sad reality. I'm only 29. I'm hardly ready for the nursing home. Well, then what's the problem? Then what, is he slapping you around? Oh, shit. He's gay. Runs in the family. You know, I hope this doesn't sound selfish, but I'm... I'm ready to be an aunt and the godmother. There. I said it.

You have a beautiful voice, young lady. How did you know I was there? I know you, Marissa. Who are you? One you're looking for. I'm not looking for anyone, I'm married. I'm... I'm happily married. Then why did you come to Club Corporal? Come see me at the club. Tonight. Come inside. Don't be afraid, Marissa. I'll protect you. Hey, honey, meetings are going great. They want me to announce my candidacy soon. They're talking about putting three million in TV ads alone. Baby, I'm gonna win this thing. Oh, anyway, uh, Mom called, she wants to know if you want to have dinner with her tonight. She's, you know, worried that you're nervous about being a first-time mom. Should I tell her yes? I love you. Bye. You have a beautiful voice, young lady. I want us to start a family. - I know you, Marissa. - I'm ready to do this. I'm the one you're looking for. We can't put our lives on hold while you chase a dream. I know you. I'll protect you. I know you. I'll protect you. Ow. Oh. Oh! Ow. We were never formally introduced the other day. We sort of got off to a weird start. I'm Olivia Devine. - Marissa Kelly. - Lovely to meet you. So, um, you're the owner? I wish. No, I'm the lucky lady who gets to run this amazing oasis. Oh! Sorry. I'm sorry. This is my first time. Never would have guessed. Come on, I'll show you around. Some people come out just to socialize. Others like to play in public. Have you played much, Marissa? Uh, play? Uh, I'm... I'm just here to observe. Right. I love Type As, so many secrets. This is Donna. Two kids at home and a husband who has no interest in this precious little corner of her soul. Oh! Ow! That is the legendary Miss Vivian. She provides real-life discipline for naughty girls. Only when they truly deserve it. Isn't that right, Olivia? What do you say we grab a glass of wine and talk a little? So I'm assuming your husband doesn't know you're here. What makes you think I'm married? Keeping this thing we do from your husband, it's not going to be easy, babe. I would love to sit here and tell you that you can be honest with him and everything will be just fine, but I can't. I lost a husband and a job to this. The only thing I miss is the job. - That's insane. - I'm sorry. I don't mean to be the prophet of doom. It's just... this fantasy is in your head, and unless you're ready to take it to the next level, sometimes it's best to just leave it there. Even if you are lucky enough to find that special someone who scratches your kinky itch, it won't last. There's always another damsel in distress waiting in the wings. If I were you, I would drink that wine and I'd walk straight out that door and I would think long and hard about what you really want. So, how exactly did you meet Slade? Um, he kind of, kind of just, um... found me. Does he come here often? He owns the place, babe. What do you mean, found you? He, uh, came to where I sang and kind of just called me and invited me here. He showed up where you sing? Yeah. Why? God, would you just smack my fucking ass? Are you okay? I'm sorry.

I asked you a question. Don't be afraid, Marissa. Hello. It gets easier, Marissa. I promise. Next Saturday is schoolgirl night. All the girls dress in schoolgirl outfits. My favorite. I bet you are a naughty schoolgirl, aren't you? Thought so. Do you know what I would have done if I was your teacher? I would have made you report to my office after school. Still there? Yes. This is part of you, Marissa. This is never going to change. Don't be ashamed of that. You can be who you are with me. Do you understand? Yes. Don't deny yourself, Marissa. Doors open at 7:00 on Saturday. Don't be late, young lady. Sleep tight. Good night. Oh, you look so good in that Earth blue. Oh, thank you. I borrowed it from... Oh, there you go. So, Marissa, I was telling Kailee that you have absolutely no experience at all with children. That can't be true. You must have some experience. Nieces, nephews, younger siblings, stray orphans. I have led a sheltered life. Well, I guess when Kristopher has a baby, you'll need to be around a lot, Mother. - What up, sis? - Oh. Happy shower. Thank you. What a surprise. Brooke is late. Your favorite child has arrived, Mother. You may begin. Um, let me guess. This one's from Marissa. Oh, yeah, I was right. Mr. Amazon gave it four stars, and it says it comes with night vision. I don't even know what that means, but I thought it was so cool. So enjoy it. Well, thank Mr. Amazon. No. Actually, thank my brother for me. Well, if this kid has lungs like my Kristopher, you'll have no use for a monitor, even along with night vision. Uh-oh, this is wonderful. You're breastfeeding. Well, what responsible mother wouldn't? That's what they're there for. It's not all they're there for. I thought it would be really difficult with your job and all. It's about priorities, Marissa. Kailee put in notice. Wow, that must have been a difficult decision for you. No-brainer, if you ask me. Well, she didn't ask you, Mother. She didn't ask anyone. Actually, she just said it must have been a difficult decision. It's a, it's a personal decision. But, um, you know, I guess everybody just does what's best for them. It's what's best for the baby, Marissa. Right, right. That's what I meant. I just, um... I just know that I wouldn't be able to give up my career like that. Career, what? I thought you said she doesn't work, Mother. Hmm. No, she doesn't. Marissa is, um... What are you again, dear? She's a singer/songwriter, Mother. Oh, right. And a very talented one, too. Oh, that's fantastic. Anything on the radio I would recognize? God, I wish. CD? No, but I... I- Do you have a website, at least? - No. - She will. I'm sure. How old are you again? - Thirty. - Twenty-nine. And you don't want to take a break from your busy music career to have a baby? Not just yet. Well, if I know my brother, he wants a family now. - Right, Mother? - Yes, honey, he does. My boy is ready. Welcome to the Kelly family. These are the annuals that survived best in the northeast region, and I have 12 of these flowers planted in various parts of the property. If you can find and identify four of these flowers, you get two seed packs from my garden, and then we can plant them all at the same time. And in the spring, we can all compare. And post photos on Instagram and share tips and ideas with anyone who has no clue what they're doing. I look forward to that part. Now, for the exciting part, the first one who finds four of these flowers wins a $50 gift certificate to Williams-Sonoma. When can we start? Right now. Good luck. You're not a child. Stop acting like one. You just have to stop this craziness. It's not craziness, it's who I am. - It's not a problem. - It's not what you are! Look at this. You think I wanna do this? You think I wanna put this shit on? I'm doing this for... Stand still any longer and you'll grow a root, Marissa. You just insist on being a complete disappointment and you do it on purpose. I am done! Done! Get out of my face. I knew you'd come. Tell me what you need, Marissa. It's okay. Now let's forget everything else. In this room, right here, right now, you're mine. You okay, Mommy? Yeah, I'm okay, honey. You sure? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Come. Come, give me a hug. Hey. Aw, I love you. Here it goes. You go to bed, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Dad's picking you up early in the morning, right? Okay. Oh. Baby, where in the hell were you last night? I was texting and calling all night. Um, can we talk? Okay, so talk. I'm having a press conference coming up next Monday. I can't be dealing with this shit. This is what I've worked for, my entire career. We're going to be under a microscope now, both of us. Now look, I know that something's going on with you. Maybe I'm not as understanding as I should be, but I've got a lot on my mind. - I know - - This means everything to me. I know it does. But I have to tell you something about me right now. Okay. So tell me. I, um... I just have something in me that... Okay, your music. I get it, Riss. And I'm gonna be as supportive as possible from now on, I promise. Look, have I ever broken a promise to you? You wanna know why I picked next Monday to announce my candidacy? It's because it's our one-year anniversary, and it's been the happiest year of my life. But I cannot have any distractions right now, do you understand? Where were you last night? Marissa, I'm dying here. Where were you? I was with Liz. We just had like a late dinner. Why didn't you return any of my phone calls? I'm sorry, we were just... we were talking all night and my phone died. Kind of like... like baby stuff? Yeah. This is our chance. The life we want, it's there for us to take. I can win the top seat. I know. Hey, buddy. You ready? Yeah. Ah. Sweetheart, I wanna talk to your dad about something real quick. Give us a minute, okay? What's wrong? Nothing's wrong. Go wait in the car, I'll be right out. The movie starts in 20 minutes, Daddy. It'll only be a minute. Promise. What? What are you doing? What do you mean, what am I doing? - You're different with her. - With who? Don't pretend you don't know what I'm talking about. You look at her differently than the others. No, I don't. Yes, Michael, you do. Look, Olivia... You look at her the way you used to look- Look, I don't have time for this. I got to go. She's married. Do you know who she's married to? Because I do. Do you know what that could do to someone like you? The trouble it could cause? We had a deal, remember? So you want me to lie for you? Yes. I just need you to say that we had dinner. So you're not gonna tell me where you were? I can't, not right now. I don't like this, Marissa. Please, because Kris is announcing his candidacy on Monday, and I can't have there be any complications. I'm not like you, Liz. Well, that's no news flash. I'm different. Different, how? I'm a freak. What? I'm a freak, Liz. You are just you. You march to the beat of your own drum, that's all. You always have. I mean, part of me is jealous. Don't be. Trust me because... I'm married to the... the nicest, sweetest, non-freakin the world, so... And I don't know what I'm doing. I'm gonna ruin my marriage. Marissa. I'm gonna ruin everything that's good in my life and I'm... I'm going to lose Kris. Marissa, stop. Stop, stop, stop. Listen, do you think I would ever, ever let that happen? Look at me. Look at me. I will never, ever let that happen to you. I have no idea what we're talking about, but whatever it is, we will fix it. We will fix it. Okay. So you were with me last night. Where did we have dinner? I'd like to thank you all for coming out today. Now, before we start, I just want to take a minute to introduce my mom. This is Jacqueline Kelly. I just wanted to congratulate her because last night she became a grandmother for the first time. Just one of my sisters, Kailee, couldn't be here. She had a beautiful 8.6-pound baby boy. Philadelphia linebacker in the making, I swear to God. I love you, Mom. Okay, okay. Now for the reason why we are here. Now, this city is in trouble. Murder rate is up. Good people are afraid. The fear is killing businesses because people are afraid to walk the streets to shop. Now something needs to be done. I have a plan to clean up the city that I love. My conviction rate in murder cases is 100% since moving over to the Homicide Division. Now Philadelphia politics has a long and sadly-tainted history of corruption. Many shameful hacks have given this great city a bad name. One thing you can be sure of, I will work night and day to make this city safe, and I will never bring shame to this office. Now, a year ago today, I married the love of my life. This is the woman I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with, the women I'm gonna raise children with. But I will not raise our children in an unsafe city. Every parent deserves the peace of mind, knowing that when their kids walk out the door, they are safe, and I am going to deliver that peace of mind. That is why today, on my first wedding anniversary, I am officially announcing my candidacy for the Office of District Attorney of Philadelphia. To- Today, I'm asking the people of the city of Philadelphia to put your faith in me. Because I promise to make you proud. Thank you all for coming out tonight. Thank you. It does. It sounds pretty... pretty interesting. Thanks again. I really appreciate you guys being here, too. - So... - It is really nice. - Nice meeting you. - Nice meeting you. - Thank you. - Thank you so much. All right. Note to the future District Attorney of Philadelphia, turn your cell phone off during press conference. I don't get it. I mean, who would text me during a press conference? Olivia. Who's Olivia? Ask Marissa. Do we know an Olivia? Who's Olivia, Marissa? Hmm. Whoever she is, she says she's an admirer of Marissa and Kris has her vote. All right, good. Now we just need about 100 million more. We need family photos for the press kit and pictures of you by yourself. Okay. Hey, thanks. Hey. Oh, you're so beautiful. - I'm so proud of you. - Hmm. I love you. I love you, too. I'll be right back, okay? Hmm. Where are you going? We got pictures. Bathroom. You don't like my video? I'm disappointed. I thought you gave an Oscar-worthy performance over that bench. What do you want, Olivia? Control. Of what? You, Slade, District Attorney Kristopher Kelly, my life. Olivia, I don't know what you think, but that was a one-time thing between me and Slade. Oh, it's never a one-time thing, honey. See, you gave in, Marissa, you tasted the forbidden fruit, and now you're gonna need it again and again and again. How do you know what I need? - Because I know you. - You don't know me. I know you because I once was you. And someday you're going to be me. Slade thinks you're special, but you're not. You're just new. He'll tire of you eventually, and when he does, he'll come running back to me because I have the one thing that you can never give him. What do you want from me, Olivia? It's simple. I control your play, relationship with Slade. For starters, you play at the club and only at the club. Olivia, I don't want this. - I never wanted- - It's not about what you want. This is about what I want, and what I want is for Slade to get you out of his system. You're crazy. Maybe, but I'm also right. Because when the TV lights are no longer shining on you and you retreat back to your boring vanilla world, that little mind of yours is going to wander. And you'll remember how it felt when Slade took control of you. How it felt to surrender to him. How he took you to a place you'd only ever fantasized about. Then you and he will reconnect again somehow and... who knows what will happen then. I'm not going to let that happen. I'm gonna give you the one thing that will fill that void inside you. The one thing that will make you feel more alive than you've ever felt before. But I'm in control, Marissa. Now I'm gonna count to three, and if you don't come out of that stall by the time I do, I'm walking out and you can explain to your husband and his whole campaign staff how you became an overnight Internet spanking video sensation and the star of the evening news. One. Two. - Three. - Okay. Okay. Good girl. Now, will you please leave? Come to Club Corporal Saturday night. Oh, doors open at 7:00. Don't be late. When I count to three, everyone say elect Kris Kelly. One. Two. Secrets. So many of us have them. They're with us morning, noon and night. They remind us that we're different. Now, a couple with just the future DA and First Lady. And the dilemma is always the same. Do we keep our secrets tucked away in some dark corner of our soul? Or do we just say fuck it and act on them? Either decision comes with a heavy, unexpected price. I have never been more terrified in my entire life. And I've never felt more alive. Holy shit.
