- You promised you were gonna help me! - I am trying to help you. Don’t ruin your life, your problems won’t get solved… I don’t give a damn anymore! I don’t care about my life anymore, you see what I’m doing? How’s that goddamn report they gave you, asshole? Isidro, stop that, let her go, she’s one of us! Put your gun down, let Leticia go, that’s an order! There they are! Hey! Pull over! Hey! Hey you! Pull over! What do you think buddy? Yeah buddy, catch up to them! Bro, get down! Shoot them! - Bro, get down! - Shit! Shoot them! Buddy! Buddy! Officer down! Officer down! Officer down, officer down! Francis, you’re burning up. Grandma, grandma?! - Hurry! - What happened? Why is he feverish? He’s getting chills. Leandro, better get him some cold compress. What's going on? The boy’s burning up with fever. Oh no, what’s happening? Francis is really burning up. Yeah, he’s really hot. Go get some socks. Call Dina. - Wipe his forehead - I will. He’s burning. Let him wear his socks. Okay. You seem to be okay now, good to see you’re smiling. I’m Dr. Nuestro, I will be your attending physician I'm just reviewing your chart, and your history. - Hello? - Dina? Hello? What's wrong? I’m doing my rounds now, you can bring him here to the hospital. Talk to Kat and ask her if she can come with you here. I will. Kat, get dressed, come with me to the hospital. - Okay, where’s the jacket? - Put it on now, grandma. Kat, hurry up! He’s still really hot. Let's go. Giselle, bring a bag. Get the door. Wait, the bag! Go inside, we’ll be right behind you. - Nurse, nurse! - Yes, ma’am? What happened? Please walk right through here. - Are you Ma’am Dina’s brother? - Yes I am. Right this way. Careful. I'll check his temperature. How is he, nurse? When did he start convulsing? - About 20 minutes ago. - 20 minutes. - Did it happen again after that? - It didn’t. His fever is 40.2, it’s very high. Give me a second, sir. Son? - Ma’am, they’re here. - Okay, thank you. How’s Francis? He’s really burning up. Kat, what’s his temperature? They said it’s 40.2. That’s way too high, do you have any cooling compress? Yes. - His fever is so high. - Let me fix it. Poor Francis. Here it is. His temperature is too high. He may have a bacterial infection. - Have they checked his vital signs? - Yeah. What should we do? The best thing we can do is observe him, and wait for the doctor’s advice. What’s the temperature? - 40.2 doc, it’s high. - Alright, it is high. Hello, good morning, his temperature is very high. Let’s double check. When did he first get a fever? Last night, Doc, he was a bit warm before he fell asleep. Alright, alright, let’s hook him up to an IV, and get him some paracetamol for his fever. Have some Diazepam on standby, just in case he gets convulsions again. Keep him on that, continue the “TSB”, and check his temperature every hour. Just in case his temperature doesn’t drop, we’ll have to get him confined for further tests. Alright? Let’s just observe him for now, okay? - Thank you, doc. - I’ll do my rounds now. Does Melissa know already? Our President! Congratulations, Sir JJ. So for Vice President? Any nominations? The table is now open for nominations for Vice President. Any nominations? Ma’am Kriselle? - I nominate Ma’am Melissa. - Ma’am Melissa is nominated. Why me? Votes for Ma’am Melissa? Who’s in favor of Ma’am Melissa? Seems like it's majority! One, two, three, four, five... Hmm, nine? Nine! For Bernold? Oh, Just one. So we have Sir JJ for President and Ma’am Melissa for Vice President. We’re done for our President and Vice President. So we now move on to voting for our Secretary. Nomination for the position of Secretary. - Sir? - I respectfully nominate Ma’am Kriselle. Kriselle is nominated for Secretary. Any more nominations for Secretary? Yes Sir? - I nominate Ma’am Angie for Secretary. - Ma'am Angie is nominated. I'm in a meeting. The nomination is... What? Okay, seconded. Now, we proceed to our voting. What? I can’t hear you, what did you say? Wait a sec, I'm heading out. I can’t hear you clearly. What happened? Huh? Okay. Alright, alright. I won’t finish up here. Okay, sure. Update me whatever happens over there. A round of applause for Sir Benjie. Let’s proceed to the voting for auditor. I’m gonna go on ahead, it’s an emergency. - I'm sorry, can you tell them? - Sure. Any more nominations for auditor? It’s alright, you can go to work now, we’ll take care of everything here. Are you getting off your shift now? We’re here until 10AM, but we’re done with our rounds. Station 1: 0900 Alright. We do have an early meeting at work today. Kat, just message or call me if anything happens. I will. Take care. That guy is here again. You wet your hair again, you know you have your period. I didn't. Hurry up, so we can eat. Looks like Isidro is not letting up on you. Don’t mind him Ma, he’ll get tired of it soon enough. Give me a second, Ma. Love. Love, let’s talk please. You really don’t get it, Isid? I just want to talk. We have nothing to talk about, Isid. You’re just embarrassing yourself. - Why should I? I just want to talk. - Stop it! Let it go! We’re through, I don’t ever want to see you again! Love, I love you so much, let’s just please talk this through. It’s over, Isid. Love... Slowly, babe, it tickles! Babe! - I love you. - I love you too… You need to go to work now. One more. You’re crazy. You want more? We’re getting married soon. - I love you so much! - I love you so much too… You need to get to work now. You told me we can do it again, you give up? You’re too much to handle. That’s what happens when you’re getting married soon, you have to give it your all. Just don’t forget our dress fitting later, alright? I will, I’ll see you later. Okay, go now, or you’ll be late. I love you. One more round later? We’ll see… - Isidro. - Chief? If she really doesn’t want you back, better just let her go and stop begging. Leandro, you’re late! - Sorry, Sir. - Buddy… You just got reinstated. What if Sheila files a harassment complaint? You might really find yourself out of the force. Chief, all I really want is to be able to have a really good talk with her. From what I heard, you’re always drunk whenever you drop by for a “serious” talk. Chief, I'm not. Leandro, you need to talk to your friend. Leandro, please call me. You know Isidro, you’re still young. All of you, listen up. You’re all still young, don’t risk your lives and careers. Separate your personal life from your professional life. Is that clear? - Copy, chief - You all get back to work. And as for you, go straight home. I’ll try to talk to Sheila myself. Tomorrow, make sure you don’t come in late. Understood? Thanks, Chief. Go now. Thanks, Chief. Just don’t forget what I said, straighten out your life. Yes, Chief. Buddy, why are you late? I had to rush your godchild to the hospital. Why? What happened? He had a high fever. Let’s talk later. Alright, buddy. Buddy, later. Leandro. Sir? Where’s the Incident Report I was looking for? Here it is, Sir, almost done. Good, print it out ASAP and bring it to my desk. - 10-4. - Okay. Sir, here's the report about Mrs. Reyes' case. Thank you. - Hey bro, you almost done? - Two minutes. Okay, copy. I’ll just be outside. We're in room 2307. Sir, it’s done. Thank you. - Jun - See you, buddy. Leticia, don’t forget about my lunch at Manang’s place. Alright. Looks like rain. Doesn’t really look like it. Shit. Here's your order, sir. Thank you. Thanks! I love you. I love you so much. Are you tired? Round two? - Round two? - No. No! You love me? I love you so much. I love you even more. Sir, here's your drinks. Bring us one more later. Fuck. Good morning Mama Lyn. Sorry I’m late, I took longer than expected at the Social Security office. It’s alright. Were you able to process the papers? Yes, next month, hopefully, Mom can receive Dad’s pension. That’s good news. I know! - Sheila. - What's that? This morning, I heard that “you know who” was called in by their chief. He was actually here earlier trying to catch you at work, but saw me instead. I heard he got lectured by his chief. Is he bothering you until now? That’s the reason why I really want to file a restraining order, hopefully that’ll finally stop him from bothering me. Are you really sure that you’re gonna see this breakup though? Becayse you know, there are others who say ’it’s over’, but let a moment pass and they get back together as if nothing ever happened. I already tried that before Mama Lyn, but I think almost three years of putting up with him, and his odd behavior is more than enough. This generation is really different. I guess I’m lucky I married a man who has no hang-ups. He was an upstanding, responsible man and a devoted husband, right down to his very last breath. - Do you have Vitamin C? - Yes we do. - Generic, or branded? - What’s the best you have? For Generic, it's Ascorbic… I need five. How much is it? 75 pesos. What is it son? Hello, mom? We’re off to do our patrolling. I’ll drop by later, I love you mom. How old are you again? 35. You really should get married now, so you don’t have to cling to your mother’s skirts anymore. Bud, don’t you dare miss my wedding, alright? It’s next week. I’m gonna push through with it because I love Ava, I’m not like you. I may have been like that before, but I’ve changed now. I’ll never cheat on my wife, I love her very much even if she’s crazy jealous. Sweetheart. How’s Francis? Was he able to get into a different room? Yes, I’ll text you the room number. Alright, is his fever still high? They told me it’s still high. You go on ahead to the hospital, I’ll drop by later. Okay, bye. Bud, can we stop here for a sec? Hold on. Hey. I didn’t think I’d still find you here. You started playing even before I left for work, and you’re still here barefoot playing basketball. See the floor is wet, what if you tripped and fell? Don’t worry about us, we’re always careful when we play. Plus I’ll be heading home soon, we already lost the game. With the way you and your buddies play ball, it’s as if there’s no tomorrow. Eman, I’m telling you, you’d better get home now. Okay, I'll go home now. Hey guys, I’m heading home now. - See you, brother. - Alright. Let's go. You’re even stricter than your father. Not really, I’m just concerned, I just don’t want him losing his way. After I and Ava get married, he’s gonna be the only one left at home to fend for mom. Is your brother still in school? He already graduated, he just isn’t actively looking for a job. What course did he finish? He’s a nurse, he even passed the board exam. He’s just not looking for a job, he’s a bit lazy. Don’t you have two sisters working as nurses in the US? That should be the plan, to get him working there, but they said he would need experience here before he can get to apply for a job there. The problem is, the “work experience” he’s busying himself with is experience fooling around with girls. Well, he does have you to look up to. Hey, I’m nothing like you! - I'll stay here. - Okay. Miss, room 2307? Sir, just turn right, go up the stairs, and when you get to the second floor, it’s on your left side. Leandro! - Is his fever still high? - Not anymore. Where’s Dina? She just went to get something from their callroom. I just went to our callroom to get some stuff. How’s Francis? Does Francis still need to get a CT-Scan? They need to get the test done just to rule out there isn’t any other reason for his convulsions, it’s for the best, at least we’ll be sure. When are they gonna do the test? I already spoke with the radiologist earlier and they can squeeze him in at 3 PM. That’s good, at least Melissa will be here by then. Here’s something for your lunch. It’s okay, grandma said she’ll drop by to bring us some food. - Is that so? - Yes. Alright then, I’ll head off now, we still have some patrolling to do. Take care. Thanks miss. Sir, let’s drink up. Did she pick up, Sir? Buddy, I’ll just be a second. Mom. Hold on, let me get your lunch. Thank you Mom, I’ll be off now. Let’s go buddy. You’ve been quite busy with that for a long while now. She’s not picking up. She’s bound to pick up sooner or later, girls are that way sometimes. Boss, your buddies. Look at Isid, he’s drinking. Buddy! Hey buddy! Drinking again, aren’t you? - You’re off to an early start today. - Nah, I’m just chilling. Come on, let’s have a few drinks. If only we could, we’re still on patrol, bro. We’ll get back to you on those drinks later after our patrol. Don’t mess with me bro, I know you, you’re just gonna slink off, let’s go now buddy. Take it easy, we’re still gonna talk later. Alright, if you say so. Take care. - Take care then. - See you later. Melissa. How’s everything? What did the doctors say? They still need to keep him here for observation. Why? His fever is still high. Kat, can you do me a favor? Can you get my extra clothes from the car? Okay. They’re in the trunk, I want to change my clothes. Thank you. - Hey Ryan. - Hey buddy. When are you getting married? It’s very soon, you all have to be there, okay? Sure we’ll be there. - How about you, Tessie? - Why? What do you mean me ‘Tessie’? - You need to get married soon too! - Mind your own business. Leandro, here's your food! Manang will drop by later for the payment. Hey buddy, when this one gets married, one roasted pig will be on us. - Yeah, I’m in. - Yeah yeah, stop teasing me. This one is tasty, my mom cooked this. - I’ll just go to the washroom. - Alright. - Here, you can get more from this one. - What’s that bro? - Fish and leaves stewed in coconut milk. - That looks really good. This is really tasty, my mom cooked this. - Wow, I’ll get some. - Go ahead. You’re phone’s been ringing the whole day. Don’t mind him, Mama Lyn. He’s probably just drunk again. Huh? Where does he even get the money to buy booze? I heard his salary got cut off since he got suspended. His grandma has him covered. He is the favorite grandchild, the very first grandson. Whatever. Love. Love, I’m here now. Love? Love. You always come home late, and drunk. Love, the boys and I just had a little fun. You’re a married man now, Isid. Someone’s waiting for you at home. You don’t even reply to my texts nor answer my calls. Love, don’t worry, it won’t happen again. It’s always like this. I’m really sorry, it won’t happen again. Stop it. Love. I apologized, didn't I? It’s like this all the time. What else do you want? See I’m down on my knees now. I’m really, really sorry. I'm sorry. Forgive me? Has she finally picked up, Sir? She froze you out again, Sir? I’ll come back for my motorcycle. No worries, I’ll keep an eye on it for you. - Just take care of my motorcycle. - Take care, Sir. Hey, asshole! Asshole. Chief! Buddy. Buddy, your gun, keep it hidden. Hide it, buddy. Isidro, didn’t I tell you earlier to just go home? Isid! You stink of beer! Maybe one of you stink of beer, I didn’t drink anything. I thought we already had an understanding? Chief? You all know what I really want. I just want to talk to my wife. You told me you… Isidro! I already told you earlier to take it easy with the drinking. - Buddy. - Come to the washroom with me. Chief, he’s getting worse. I told you to relax with the drinking, man. I’m really sorry, buddy. We were supposed to hang out later, alright buddy, - I’ll let you be, okay? - Okay. - Isidro, you need to go home. - Chief. - I said go home and that’s an order! - Come on bro, I’ll take you home. Bro, calm down! Relax! Isidro, put your gun down, everyone, calm down! Isidro, I’m begging you, what you’re doing is wrong! What’s the meaning of all this? You’re asking what this all means, Chief? I keep telling all of you over and over. I just want to talk to my wife! I just want to talk to her! You think you’re gonna get what you want this way? Any way that I can get what I want, I’ll do it! Do you even know what you’re doing, Isidro? Put your gun down, let Leticia go, right this instant! You understand me, buddy, right? - Of course I do. - I just want to talk to my wife. There’s nothing wrong with that, I can even bring her here for you. But you won’t get what you want this way. Chief, do you want me to call up my mom? She works with Sheila. No! No. I want to see my wife and I want to talk to her face to face. Chief, you told me you were gonna help me right? - I am trying to help you. - When did you ever? - Don’t make everything worse! - Where’s my wife? Isidro, if you can’t respect me, respect this precinct, respect your badge! Ouch! - Stop it! - You don’t like me, right? Leandro, go with Ryan. Buddy, take it easy or I’ll blow her brains out! Bro, you know we can’t step out of the precinct unarmed. You know that, right? Relax. Calm down. - Ryan, give your mom a heads up. - 10-4 Chief. Bud. I just want to talk to my wife. You want this? Huh? You motherfucker, where’s your report now, huh? - Isidro! - Where’s the report, huh? - Bud, bud! - Calm down, Isidro, calm down! - Come on, let’s just have a drink outside. - You want to drink, huh? The two of us? You, me, and my wife? Give me what I want, bring my wife here! Ryan? Huh? Alright, I will tell her. Sheila. Hello hon, there’s just a situation at the precinct. I'll drop by in a while. Bye, I love you hon. Hello mom. Sheila, can we invite you down to the precinct? Isid is getting really desperate to talk to you. We’ll also bring you back here, he just really needs to talk to you. My child, please, I’ll take care of everything here, it won’t take long. Please, it’ll be over before you know it. Alright, I’ll come with you. Just make sure that after all this, he will stop bothering me. - Sheila will be sitting up front, alright? - Okay. I’ll sit at the back. - Mom, we’re off. - Take care. Here it is, thank you. You shameless animals! How dare you! You slut! You asshole! - Sheila, stop it! - You asshole! How could you! - And inside our own home! - Let me explain! - You're an asshole. - Sorry Sheila! Damnit, I said stop it! I’m sorry my love, I didn’t mean it. Let me explain. - I love you so much! - No! There’s nothing to explain, Isid! Everything is clear to me now. We’re over, you can go live with that whore! - Let’s talk. - We’re done, Sid! - We’re over! - I’m begging you, please! Sheila, let’s go! Help! Help us! My baby! Help! You can talk to him, he’s inside. Tell him we can talk right here. Put your gun down. - Put the gun down. - Where’s my wife?! Shiela's here. You should talk to her. I don’t believe you, buddy. There’s no reason to doubt me, why would I even lie to you? Let her in here. We’re lucky we even got her to come with us, give her a little bit of dignity, won’t you? I want to talk to her inside this precinct! And I want all of you to hear it! Officers calm down, everybody calm down, Calm down! Officers! Everybody calm down! Isidro, calm down! Officers calm down! 10-5210-52, station 1, we need an ambulance, over! Bro... Pass the ball! Wait. - I’m tired. - You're tired? I'll go ahead. You’re so pretty! Where’s my wife? Bro, I’m sorry. There's no pulse. There's still a pulse. Take it easy, alright? One, two, three! One, two, three! After you complete your statement, you can go home. Your brother is calling. Hello, hon. So what happened? I’ve been calling you many times before, where were you? Is that so? So how are you doing? Are you alright? Okay, I’m still here with Kat, we’re still waiting for the CT Scan results. Is that so? Alright, we’ll wait for you here. Hurry up then, bye my love. - What’s the matter, sis? - There was a shooting at the station. Over at brother’s precinct? How’s he then? He says he’s okay, but you know... There he is. - Melissa, the tests are done. - It's done? How are the CT Scan results? We’ll update you, Ma’am, once the results are out. Thank you! I’m sorry. I’ll sit at the back, bro. - Mom, we’re off. - Take care. We’re heading off, mom… That’s not possible! That’s not possible! I can’t take this! It’s a bit tight around the chest area. Alright, I'll loosen it up a bit it for you. - Where’s Ryan? - Ryan? I rang him up many times a while back but he’s not picking up. Ryan’s calling, pick it up. Hello hon? I’ve been calling you a while back… What? Are you alright? Sai, can you get a glass of water, please? Station 1. Copy, thank you. 10-42. Time of death, 5:40. Tell Chief, I’ll finish the report tomorrow. He’s not that hot anymore. - Hi! How’s the temperature? - Hi Doc. - 37.8 Doc. - Alright, that’s good! Let’s check. - So the temperature went down? - Yes. Inhale, exhale. Wow, very good, great job baby! - Yes! - How about a fist bump? Good! You know he’s okay now, his vital signs are much better now, and there hasn't been any convulsions. So what’s the reason for his high fever, Doc? It’s just a bacterial infection from a UTI, which is normal for kids. His fever went down because we gave him some antibiotics. If he doesn’t get feverish again today, I think he can go home tomorrow. - Yes! - Yes! Very good! - We can get out of here son! - Fist bump! Alright, I'll go ahead. - Thank you, bye. - Thanks, Doc! That’s great news son, you can get dressed soon, we can go home. Give mommy a kiss! Yes! Six, seven, eight, nine, ten! - One plus one? - Two. Very good! My boy is so smart! - Two plus two? - Four! Very good, son! - Daddy! - Hey, hon! Your baby is all better now! Daddy is here! Yes!
