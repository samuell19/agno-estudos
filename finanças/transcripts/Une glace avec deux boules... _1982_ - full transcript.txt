Vanessa! Vanessa! Vanessa! Vanessa! Vanessa! Can't you just leave me alone? You might have nerves, do you know what time it is? Damn shit... -Now don't start bitching, yeah. Well if you have to... Come on. And what about me? And you learn to control yourself! Hey... but remember, 5 o'clock at the Abbey. Une glace avec deux boules For my daughter who is already 14, uh 14.5. Are you leaving And what about the dinner? And what will grandpa say? Mom will explain it to you. Won't you kiss me? Mummy... Mummy. Mummy. Don't yell like that, I'm not deaf! Dad just scrammed. Well, what's going on here? Are you having lunch or are you having a funeral? Dad ran away with a friend. Yes, young flesh... that drives they crazy. The stallions. Well, you're not going to give up right away, are you? So I bet he... in 8 days at the latest he will have had enough of his bed bunny. If he believes, when he jumps on her... that it helps against his hair loss... so he will soon notice that she only suck him dry. We'll see how quickly he's back with his wife. Here have a drink. That desalts the tears. They're all the same. My god you are stupid! Would you have listened to me And instead of playing housewife, you would have picked somebody up. Then you wouldn't be sitting around looking so embarrassed and he would still be here. Maybe he'd be a bastard too, but he'd still be here. This is Grandpa. Grandpa! Grandpa! Dad took off with his bed bunny. Good day everyone. Hello George. I think I'll bring it to the kitchen right away, right? OK Howdy my darling. Don't take it so tragically. Well, men who had nerver served in the army, will end as losers. I always said. Hello there. It's the wrong knife... -Let me sit down for now. It's wrong... -Then you damn set the table! Stop arguing! Tell me grandpa, mmm? Dad was never a soldier? No. Never. There are no real men today Monsieur Albion. In my perfumery e.g. All just slackers. Well, slackers are not only available in your perfumery, dearest Julie. What do you think they did in my regiment to evade duty? They mixed cinine in cigarette tobacco and smoked the stuff. A radical agent. In no time they got extreme fever. But they couldn't trick me. Right George? Yes sir, lieutenant colonel. Uh, didn't you provide white wine for the chicken? Yes Dad. Cheers. Why did dad leave us? Does he no longer love us? What do I know, leave me alone! But what about us now? Don't be so selfish. Better think of mom. But that's what I'm doing right now. It won't be easy to find another man at her age. Where is he? Julie says men are stupid. So we're probably smarter than them. So we should find a solution. I have an idea. We kill each other. Are you out of your mind? And if papa doesn't come back, we would have died for nothing. No. We have to make it clear to him that he is wrong. So I'm listening. We wanted to ask you to come back home. Did mom send you? No mom has no idea about it. Boss, hello boss, I need these.... Yes, switch off your amplifier, the croaking is terrible. And then try the little Renault, the shock absorbers are gone. Oh, it's still a madhouse, you can't discuss here. I'll make you a suggestion. Let's go to the sea on Saturday, what do you think? Then we can talk in peace. Louis said you don't have a customer with you and... and since the matter is urgent, Oh... These are probably your daughters...? Yeah uh Lorence and uh... Lorence and uh Vanessa Good day. It's about the check. -Oh wait a minute. You fill it out yourself, yes? OK Thank you. Goodbye ladies. And please don't forget to bring the receipts, okay? Maite, uh Mademoiselle Caquir works at the registration office. Is she your girlfriend? And at school, everything ok? -Oh yes, it's alright. Anything else you need? huh? You could also write me a check. And what for? I'd like to get a transistor like this... Well, you know that kind of Walkman. Well, how much does it cost? 600 francs. 600? -Yes, but with two headphones. Ah yes of course. Here. -Many Thanks. 600 francs, that's exactly right. The Second Empire has from 1852 to 1870 with a railway network of uh... 18000 km in length connected our cities to each other. Which roughly corresponds to our current route length. Recently our... Route network considerably through the uh... Through the... May I ask! Sit down. With the introduction of super-fast passenger trains, upgraded on the north-south link. 42,000 km of telegraph lines were created. Here's a little anecdote. "There are footprints in the ceiling." Very witty. A farmer received a letter from his son in Crimea, Vanessa what's the matter with you? Nothing, why, what could be wrong? Is it because of Alian? You don't want to tell me. But there is nothing. So now you've witnessed a childbirth. Is she your girlfriend? -Madmoiselle Caquir works at the admissions office... And I am sure you are very impressed. Well before a confinement, a birth, Conception must have taken place first. And for that, in turn, a man and a woman must have had a sexual union. Well, before you can have a child you have to go through that critical age. That's called puberty. Who can tell me what puberty is? Then you grow up. Well, and at what age does this happen? Between 13 and 14. -13 and 14. Maybe a little earlier. Uh, what happens then? You transform. Take your finger out of your nose, it's unaesthetic. You can do it at home and not here. Yes, one transforms one changes. But in which way? We've got you captuerd. I get a deduction from that, okay? I can sell you one. Anything else? I'll buy you a coke. Agreed. ...saw her naked in the bathroom once. And thereby... Lerydo Lerydo, you're late again. And knowing you, you have another excellent excuse. Last week it was your uncle. And who is it today? My father Monsieur. What about your father? He died. Died? Lerydo tell your mother that I want to speak to her. But she won't be able to come, Monsieur. So? And why not? She had polio when she was 8 years old and hasn't been able to get out of her wheelchair ever since. A tragedy. We'll catch up on all of that. Today 4 o'clock. story time And Lolo too. 4 o'clock. Smells fantastic don't you think? -Ladies, may I ask you to stand up? Monsieur Deni... -It didn't ring! The bell is broken, so please ladies. There are at least three minutes yet. Your clock is wrong. -Sorry 11 am, sorry. Vanessa! -What's the matter now? I have to tell you something. And? Julie says love is blind. But disappointed love makes you see again. Oh Julie says a lot. Yes, but somehow she's right. Watch out. Dad doesn't want to come back because of his bunny. But if she cheats on him Then he will come back. Nothing is impossible. I tell you 100%. Fine if you say so. But first you have to find someone to sleep with her. We have one. Alain. Lolo are you out of your mind? Since he's in the army, I hardly see him anymore.. That's out of the question! Look at all the duds here. It was quite a bit of work to pick up a guy who had a moped. You still have your whole life ahead of you. But that is still no reason to let Alain jump on Daddy's cutie. Oh man you are jealous. -Bullshit. Do you want to marry him? -No I do not think so. Well listen. Then you can borrow him. This small investment that should be worth it to you. I'm telling you, that's out of the question. You are selfish. -But maybe there's another solution. Brigitte told me her mother went to see her father's friend. And that would have worked. Can you imagine that mom goes to Maite? Mom not... but I. She goes to the pool this afternoon, I'll meet her there. I will accompany you. No, women settle among themselves. Then she will feel very lonely. Woa, the shower is crazy cold again. By the way, are you still dating Luca? Yes, but definitely not for much longer. And why? Oh he's like a limpet, that annoys me terribly. I think he's a great boy. He? Honestly, I think he is super. Go in! Hello there. -Hello there. Still sad? Yes it's alright Ok now get in there. Oops. Ahh. Be careful the water is wet. Don't slip off, I've seen you before. I'll be close by if you need help. Leave me alone and get out! That's a flop, you'll see. I don't want you here, got it? But you can't really care about that. Get out or get your ass kicked! You awful goose! Goose yourself! Hello there. Hello there. I love the cut of your bathing suit. Thank you. Did you buy it here? No, in Paris. Oh Paris. Do you often go to Paris? Now and again. We were there with dad last Easter. We had great fun. Do you love my father? You go to the shower immediately. Be so kind and wash your ears too. Good Lord, that might get on your nerves. Damn it, I'm not a goldfish. What a bitch! She never said anything to me about that. Hello mum. I am back again. Lolo... Where are you? Don't you think you're exaggerating a bit? Such a hog. So what now was. What did she say? She doesn't want to give up on dad. That bitch, what did she say then? Oh things. What things? You wouldn't understand anyway. Yes, I'm a complete idiot. No, you're just too small. Such nonsense, too small. Do you think I don't know what it is, sleeping with a boy? Yes you might know. But there is still a difference between knowing and doing. Oh, and you don't just know it, you do it too? For me it's something else. Besides, it's none of your business. If Mama finds out you're doing it with Alain, then something is going on here, my dear sis. I thought so. You didn't shower at all. No, I'm just debating. So you discuss. And I'm going to put you in the bathtub now. -Leave me alone, I'm not a baby. -Come on. It's all the worse that you still have to be washed at your age. My patience is over now. Come on now How long have you had this t-shirt now? I have no idea, hey careful, you're hurting me! Ouch, leave me alone! -I'll just go over to the train station. Alain arrives at 08.13. But at 09.00 o'clock there is dinner. -Ow! Yes I'll be right back. No please not that hurts! Ouch, ouch, the water is much too cold! Now go on alone. It's another battlefield here. You could alos clean up a bit. Egad. Tell me mom, has dad moved away forever? I don't know my child. But you want him to come back. Yes of course, don't you? Believe me mom, Dad will return. Don't take it so hard, you have to trust me. What do you think the people in my regiment did to evade duty? They mixed cinin in cigarette tobacco and smoked the stuff. The radicals, in no time at all they got extrem fever. And what kind. And what kind. Patrick. -Yes Boss? Gearshift ok? Is fine. Then Douval can pick it up today? Yes, as agreed boss. Hey Daniel Phone. She has a fever over 40. Yes, I've already notified Gilbert. Of course I put her to bed. Yes, but hurry up. To cough. To cough. Lay on your back. Does this hurt? Yes, that's where it hurts. Well, appendix of course. We'll have to operate right away. -But there it doesn't hurt at all! I mean, now it doesn't hurt so much anymore, it's ok again. And there, does it hurt? No, no, it's ok again. So now almost not at all. -Uh-huh. Well, we'll have to wait and see. If the temperature rises again, call me immediately, I'm in the practice. Yes, I'll call you Gilbert, thank you very much. Hope everything goes well. Greetings, good night. How are you? Fine and you? - Oh... I'm fine too. And I'm hungry now. So honey, are you feeling better? Yes. I think it's great to see you both here together. Well, now I have to move on again. You want to go already? Dad still has work to do. You have to sleep now. No, no, not just let. You know the way. -Yes. So get some sleep first, my darling. Dad said Lolo has a fever? Yes, a little over 40°. Mmh, that smells damn like an exam. I'll make you a nice strong broth. -Oh yeah mom. Are you looking for this? Give it to me now! By my ass. First you lend me Alain. Give that back right now, Lolo! Borrow me Alain, or I'll tell mom. Give it to me now, you cheeky bitch! You bitch, I'll tell mom. You shut the mouth, understood? Give it here. Bitch! -So what's going on? What does this mean? She started. -She's walks across the room. Go to bed. And you leave your sister alone! Don't you see that she is ill. Enough. Here, drink this my darling. Mom, I have to tell you something. -What my darling? I love you honestly. My little... Well, yes or no? Well I uh... To be honest I don't know. You're wearing a uniform, women like it. I don't particularly like it. Don't you like Maite? If Papa likes her, then you will too... - That's not the reason. If it were that easy. Taking her panties off, what's so difficult about that? It's not a problem, have you done it before or not? I believe you're duck out. You're not gay, are you? How does Vanessa thing about this? My sister thinks the same as me about it. The family first. Alain. How many times you knocked you over now? 19 times Monsieur Dalbret. At 20 there's a bonus, let me know. Mmh, Mademoiselle you smell like love and the sea. You have a blackhead -Oh. Oh no. No please let me alone, I beg you. Now let me go. No please Maite... -Now don't be like that. I won't hurt you. -Now look at this. Yes you say that every time. Hey you have very sandy hands. With mom he woud have found it silly. -Hold still. So now stop it. Or I jump in the water. Now you can disturb again. Father. -Yes, what is it? Will you come please? - Yes, of course. Alain. Maite. Come over. I'll teach you how to surf. Careful, yes, yes. That's how it works, yes. So now come up. Stand upright? Sure, of course. And should I head over there? Don't you want to know how things at home are? Yes, of course. Well, mom feels so-so. How it feels when you're left-behind after 17 years. You know I'd like to explain you the reasons... -What reasons are there? Oh, huge. So much... Look... I've tried again and again, So I have tried. -I'm not angry. I just find it a bit idiotic. -Why idiotic? Well you and Maite and then the age difference. Well the old to the old what? Keep your sense of humor. But you're not that young anymore. You have already put on a belly. If you think it's because of your looks then you're wrong. Because she's not in love with you. She is in love with her security. But at least you're together with a woman. Because it's not the real thing all alone, that applies to everyone. Also for mom. What? Does your mother has a... -Hey you two there. What secrets do you have? Do we go back? Already? I have a party tomorrow and I don't like it here. That's a loser, my God. Are you bored? I'm not here to enjoy myself. So what are you doing now? I try to think. Hello Monsieur Cardonet... What are you doing there? As a pharmacist, you sell thermometers, don't you? Very well. Stick one up your ass! Guys don't overdo it. Oh those galvanized ravens Do you have trouble with Alain? That idiot. If you don't want him anymore let me know. Hey take care of your old man. Hello Monsieur Cardonet... Hello Monsieur, this is Commissioner Silberblick from the youth department. I'm calling you because we just arrested a gang of youth... Which harassed people with bogus calls, Monsieur. They confessed to us that you too was among their recent victims M. Cardonet. Now, for the record, I need to know exactly what they said to you. Please? You should get that... you should get that thermometer... Oh. And when did the call come in? Tell me, Monsieur, do you remember the time? Already 20 minutes ago? I think you can take it out now. Alain has been dancing with Silvia for a long time now, don't you think? Mind your own frigging business!. The most beautiful addiction is jealousy. Here to cool you down a bit! Are you crazy? -Are you out to impress sb.? Come on sweetie. Hey now it's my turn. -But noway. You're mine clear? - Get lost you knucklehead! Abbey dude, go away! You shut the fuck up! -Hey... Do you want to get smart with me... -Stupid asshole... -guys... Jeez, go away. Let me go yeah. Fucking asshole! You stay out of this. Get your fingers off you fucking bastard. Hey come here, I'll show you. So did that happen? Come on I have to tell you something. Now listen, listen carefully. If we don't get dad jealous through Maite, then we'll do it through mom. And what does that mean in plain language? We will get at friend ... for mom. Is that your idea? -Sure. Have you lost your marbles? Now it's happened. Alan is gone. I don't care. Do you know what she proposes? -What? She says we should get mom a boyfriend. I think that's not so stupid. Ever since my mom got a boyfriend, she's been a lot nicer to me. And the joke woud be on dad. Neat. Yes, that would sting him so much that he would come back again. What do you think about. To a friend? If he's nice why not? And of course he has to be rich. But not married. A little more mature. Tender. Super manly. Big but not too big. Yes, but with big eyes. I love men with big eyes. Are you looking for one for mom or for you? Well for both of us. Or for the three of us. After all, we have to like him too, right? Shall we jump in? Wouldn't be a bad idea. We don't have bathing suits with us. It doesn't matter, nobody's watching. So let's jump in. Come on, chaps! It is warm for sure. Wah nice, it refreshes. Huh, well could be warmer. What is it, aren't you coming? No, I don't feel like it today. If mom could see that I take a bath, she'd be happy. Oh I completely forgot... I saw Alain. And I told him like you told me: "if you think Vanessa likes you, you're definitely wrong my dear". "You have probably already nocticed that she's going steady with Loran now". And what did he say? You should have seen his face, pale as a corpse. But after all, it was his fault, wasn't it? Personally, I would never have enterd into your sister's plan. I would simply have said: without me, find someone else. Hey, there are two screwing down there. What honestly? Yes down there in the water. - That's really tough. Hey what's the matter with you? And completely unashamed. Is it that what Julie always... -Psst. What Julie always calls brother? -Be quiet and inform yourself. Seems to be fun. Not bad the guy. Can you recognize if he's wearing a wedding ring? Well that's too far away. No is not recognizable. You have to get closer. Hey, Monsieur! Sorry to bother you. Hold on a second, I need to talk to you. Hey, come over here. Don't be embarrassed. Are you insane? Excuse me, we just came by. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo on July 28, 1914 Namely from a student named Princip. P-R-I-N-C-I-P On July 23rd, uh... Poi Carre and Vivianie back from Russia. On July 28, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Jean-Marie. I know you're a monkey, get off the stool. For the first time since the Congress of Vienna... The doorbell rang, Monsieur. Europe is in a continental conflict... -Monsieur, the doorbell rang. I heard it. Engaged in a continental conflict. And so begins the First World War in Europe. From which the continent... demoralized... and impoverished, emerges. Didn't you hear? The bell has just rang. So I think the adults are all totally spaced out. And there you are right. They don't even know what it's about. - That's right, they're stupid. Greetings to you all! -Hi. -Hello Howdy. Hello there. You let me sit there, yes? Yes OK, come have a seat. Thanks, I appreciate it. So? Jean Marie sneaked up again today. I haven't spoken to him in 3 days. Of course he asked why I wasn't talking to him, but Ididn't answer him, otherwise I would talked to him again. Say, do you smoke weed? If it weren't so expensive I'd always smoke it. And do you like it? Yes, it's all so shitty what remains at the end? These young people. Vanessa Do you also have a thermometer at home? Yes we have. But I have to disappoint you, I won't stick it up my ass, nor anywhere else, no matter how funny you find it. Another disappointment You have a thermometer and don't want to use it. She's spoiled, she already has a vibrator. Tell me guys, how can you get the pill? All you have to do is go to the family planning. If you don't dare, just ask an older friend. You'll know one, won't you? Why don't you talk to your mother about it? Forget it. If I would tell my mother, she would immediately starts crying and telling my father. And he would slap me. Don't you get along with her? You don't know my mother. If I would tell her that I want to sleep with Domink, she would have a stroke. So, my mom appreciates this. She even took me to the gynecologist. And how about you? I don't have any problems either. Vanessa we mustn't miss the bus, otherwise we get into trouble again. -Nuts. Well, mom wants us to be on time too. Can't you just leave me alone? -Okay, but I'm going home. Can't you just forget me for 5 minutes? 5 minutes yes. But not a minute more. So sister this costs you a double portion of ice cream. Here and now get lost! Eternal merry month of may with your sis? -Ah I hate her. Nicole. Nicole. Who is the chick? -Vanessa's cousin. She works here in town. In an antique shop. -Hello there. Same to you. How's work? - Thanks, dug up something great. What is that? -Wait a moment. This is a tiara worn by the black maiden de Bouchefort. Dates from the 18th century. Do you have time? -Yes. Will you drive us home? Isn't Lolo with you? She's buzzing around here. Wait I'll just get my bag. The illustrious court of the gentleman de la Compiere, has the great joy, to solemnly incorporate in his circle today, a master winemaker.

Hey listen guys. -Hey what's up with you now? He's there too. -Who's there? That guy from the river over there. I recognized him immediately. I bet you anything that it is him . Where then? Well, the one with the bottle. He doesn't wear a wedding ring. Hey grandpa -Yes. I need money. - Fine, I'll take another. And what for? -For mom's birthday. How much do you want? I do not know yet. You and Vanessa will surely know what you're planning to give her. Who knows what they're think up again. -A friend. That's a good idea. You can tell him that 68-year-old... We've got hatched a great plot. Ask Vanessa how much it costs. But you can't buy that. -Who says that? Everything can be bought. And now dismiss! And that... -Grandpa says you can buy anything. Did you tell him what it was about? Of course. Now come on. Did Lolo really tell you we're going to buy mom a boyfriend? I told you we were going to buy mom a boyfriend. A what! You said that would be a good idea. What, did I say that!? Affirmative you have! And that I should ask Vanessa how much it cost. Oh, you can't buy a friend, my child. You said you can buy anything. -Well, almost anything. Not everything. Not like that. Grandpa you once said that money is the soul of the warfare, and I wage war by all available means. You are now trying to make an acquaintance and charm him. So and now dismiss! I'll change my clothes now. So Monsieur Dalbion is your grandfather? I like it. Maybe I'll do a broadcast with him. I'm doing some interviews next week. Well. My sister Lorence, this is Paul. Paul Bertier. Hello Lorence. Good day. - Haven't I seen you somewhere before? Uh no. -Impossible. She just came from Paris. Because Paul is here to organize a private TV station. Some kind of a pirate station. Ah, a pirate. I've seen you somewhere before. -Quite impossible. You know, It's starts to piss me off, I'm constantly getting sucked into this crap. Do you know his girlfriend? -Yes Your father has becom fond of something crazy. She turns him on, just not my mother. Oh, your mother is also nothing to sneeze at. My father always says he wants to get it on with her. It's a joke. Somehow she lives under a rock. How she dresses already. Hey Vanessa, Vanessa! Honestly, she breaks my nerves, someday I'll kill her. Hello Varie, how are you? -Well kiddos. You will go home with us? No, we have to pick each other up. I'll come home around six. Tell mom. By the way, if the Paul thing is supposed to work, we'll have to put in a bit of effort. With that fierce competition. I fear mom will easily fall by the wayside. What is it? What's the matter? Nothing you are absolutely right. Well let's rebuild mom. But who should pay for that? We can't accost dad for money because of that. Dad not. But Grandpa. Grandpa okay. I'll do as you told me. Do you want to speak to her? Ok I'll do. Little kiss. Take care. Mademoiselle, my grandfather would like to see you. Thank you. Hi. Good day Monsieur. Certainly. That's fine. Thank you. Goodbye Monsieur Dalbion. Have a good time. How do I look? -Great. Honestly, great. Grandpa will like that. But the headscarf makes her look terribly conservative. Don't you think so too? Only patience. We will transform her completely. What y'all do to me. Oh how pretty you are Did dad come? -No Julie. Howdy gang. Wow! The work of my daughters. -Great what? Bravo sweethearts. I came because Monique left me. And I want you to replace her, you're a licensed beautician. But I haven't worked in 17 years. So what. You don't have to be Elizabeth Arden to render the facades of our housewives. And making jam is not a new start in life either. I don't know if I can play it that way. Believe me my love in such cases there is only one remedy, work. And before you cry your pain down the drain, I'll take you out tonight. No, that's not possible, I can't... -Go along with her, mom. Say yes already. Do not forget. We're not here tonight. We're going to the theater with dad. And then we sleep at his place. Tonight we're solo out on the town. To celebrate your new start. And of course the new job. You look really great. Do you really think so? I'm telling you this as your boss. So now quickly to my place, I'll change and then we'll have a nice meal. And then we dance. The night is ours. Mom, just don't act like Cinderella. Just don't be too nice! Good evening Julie, how are you? Hello Gerald. This is Sarah my friend. Very pleased. I reserved a table for you. I feel very strange being alone in the bar. After all, I'm still here, right? Well, that's not what I meant. -Yes, yes I know without men. But with the guys, that's easy. All you have to do is clap your hands and they will fall from the ceiling. 10, 15, 20. The big one at the bar. He's been watching you since we got here. All you need to do is cough, and then he'll get off the starting blocks. That's all spring chickens here. But only the mature chicken taste good, And experience always comes before youth. Come on, let's go dancing. You go alone, I'll watch. Now don't spoil the game. -No later. Listen. So you really let me tremble alone? May I have this dance? No, she wants too. She only has inhibitions. Please? -I said: she wants too. She dance with you all the night. I don't want to impose myself. -What do you say? I don't want to seem pushy. - You have my permission. Hello Julie, I don't know, do you already know Maite? Julia Richard. -Knowing would be saying too much. But I've heard a lot about her, Daniel. You are adorable Mademoiselle. -Thank you. Have you seen back there? It's great, isn't it? I think it's a bit crowded here tonight. Let's go somewhere else. Come. Good night. Oh sorry. Can you maybe take me into town, I was here with friends. And now they left without me, they forgot me. Well not very nice. Come on, get in. I hope you're not in too much in a hurry, I have to drop off my girlfriend first. No, not at all. I just have to catch my plane tomorrow morning. Ah, wonderful. If you have time, we can drink another glass with Sarah. Oh darling. -What is it? My bag. -What kind of bag? I guess I forgot that at the club. You have left it in the car. I'm sorry but I really need to look. Take good care of Sarah! You still know how to do it...? -Julie you are terrible. I, I've already helped myself, ok? Is that a, a li...? A lithograph? You there lies a man in Mama's bed. Are you sure? Look for yourself. Who is that? No idea, but he's not ours. So he's... - Seems like that to me too. Well, are you awake already? Bernard, my daughters. Good morning. Very funny. -What do you find so funny? Sarah Bernard. Come and sit down Tea, coffee? I'd like coffee if you don't mind. And when did you say your plane leaves? Oh, there's another one, I hope. I have to go to my hotel first anyway. Um... Do you have fire? No. Did you say the machine is already gone? -Yes Madam. The gangway has already moved in. Unfortunately too late. -Many Thanks. Pleasure Madam. I still have two places. -It's wonderful. You only need one? Your name? - Gutty Bernard. Good..? -Gutty with Y Gutty Bernard. May I have your air ticket? Thank you. Thank you and have agood flight Monsieur. -Thank you. It worked. I'm on the 10:40 flight. I would like to see you again -You know that... That's not possible Bernard. Yes I know. We're not in Paris. In the provinces, it's about the good reputation. Have a good trip. Be well. Thank you No, this belongs there. You say something different every time. It was like that last time. Now don't start arguing again. A knife is still missing. I'm already going I'll be right there. Then get it. Mom, may I introduce Paul to you? A friend, we invited him. -Good day Madame. Hello Paul. How's the show? Howdy Lorence. That was good, wasn't it? -Oh yes. Do you stay longer with us...? -Sorry... I mean, are you employed her longer? This depends on, um. This depends on how everything develops. That is to say, you know why I'm here. They didn't tell you? - I have no idea, no I really don't know. So that was it, I had fed up of Paris. And so I teamed up with a few friends to set something up. A.., some kind of TV station. You drank too much. -A small TV station. So this was really good I must say. Such a small regional station. Which we set up for local broadcast here. For you mom. Kisses and all the best wishes for Mother's Day. That's so sweet of you. Lolo. I hold it. Vanessa And tonight I'll wash the dishes. How about to take a photo? -Oh yes that would be nice. Where's the camera? -Over there. No please Lolo don't sit down, stand up. Yes OK. Yes but... Vanessa, lean forward to your mother. So yes. Yes good. -Like that? Yes good Good. Let's go. No, get a little closer. So yes. On the count of three you blow out the candles. Attention. One two three. What's going on? Oh, there it comes. I'll make another one. Moment. I have to pull it out. Yes I think we can do it that way. Yes? I just wanted to apologize because we were a bit surprised this morning. You and this immature boy. You would have preferred your friend Paul? Oh yes, he's great, he'd be a man for you. And how do you know? -It is blindingly obvious. The way he looked at you. Do you think so? Well, what's up with my big daughter? Mummy? Tell me about love. Mom must tell you, that she doesn't know much about it. But believe in it. And dad? Dad, that's probably another matter. Weren't you in love with him? No. So then... Did you get me without love? You came very quickly, very quickly. And we had very little money, so we gave you to grandma in Alsace. Have you never been in love? Oh there were many who courted me But father payed attention. He said they wanted to marry me because of him, because of his money. Wheron I told him: "I'm prettier than you." I think the sexuality of their daughters is something frightening for fathers. Why frightening? I do not know either. All I know is that it scares them. Hello. Yes OK. Well I await you. Okay, see you in a bit. Your father. He says he'll be right there. Will he come back? Yes. Do you already know the latest news? Do you already know the latest news? Is dad coming back? How do you know? A good tactic always pays off. Very easily. But no. Listen... no if I tell you. But yes I love you, I'll explain. I'll call you later yes. See you later. Are you leaving immediately? -Yes. Can you take me to school? -Mmm. Lolo is not coming? - Not this morning. So I don't have to take the bus. -Mmm Can we leave now? And now Corin wishes you a safe journey. It's 8:15 a.m. Don't have it too far. Drive with common sense. I read your letter. What is this story? But it is not a story. It is the truth. Does your mother know? Actually, I wanted to talk to her about it. But she wouldn't understand now. Look I'm 16 now. And I want to sleep with Alain. If only I knew what do you like about this guy. He's not like the others. And besides, he's far too young. -No, absolutely not. But I'm also a bit scared, I admit it. Yes, shall I...? Should I make an appointment for you with Dr., With Guilbert? -For what reason? Because he's a gynecologist, right? What does that have to do with it? Have you read the books I bought you? Listen dad. I'm talking about feelings and you are talking about sex. That's not very encouraging. What..., what do you expect of me? My blessings or what? So you know... Why not? My answer is no. And here's Corin again. At 8.30 a.m. we hear the latest from the day... but before that, 7 minutes of advertising. I can't use this the car. Scratches and dents everywhere. We're not in Paris here. Uh, did he come? -Who do you mean boss? The customer with the Alfin. -Yes, he's waiting in the back. Listen 10-grader, are you interested in this? The topic of our last physics work. Yes of course. -You bet. 100% guarantee for correctness. How much? 30 francs. Are you...? -You're crazy. -Expensive. Expensive? Don't make me laugh! It was 20 last month. Everything is gettinng more expensive. It's all more expensive. Vegetables, meat, milk, oil, petrol... We just have to pool. -Come on. - I still have 14 francs. Maybe I have something too. -I don't know if I have small change. I only have big banknotes now... Oh I don't think it's enough. Give me 50 Franc. I give you change. There you have it. - Even if it's difficult. OK Please. So now you are get off lightly. -Hopefully it won't be more expensive again next week. No more package prices! Next time everyone pays for himself. Oh... -Extortion methods! Are you out of your mind? Kill yourself for my sake, but leave my husband alone! Such a lousy bitch! Daniel Daniel! If your little bitch insults me again on the phone, then I cannot guarantee anything! How to work here with that noise? Daniel answer me! Has anybody seen my Walkman? You wimp. Come out if you're a man! I don't want to sift the whole calculation again in detail. Because each of you found the right solution. Which to be honest surprised me. I conclude that you owe this progress to the attentive participation in my lessons. Unless there is another explanation for it. With young people of your type, whose cooperation often leaves a lot to be desired, this is indeed gratifying but at the same time suspicious. If everyone accomplish it and the only diligent one in this class gets a bad mark. At least that's unusual. Because Mademoiselle Veronicke usually gets pretty good marks. So the question arises... -She was the only one who didn't pay. ...how to explain this unanimous and unique achievement. How could this examination task be easy for you, a task that, in my opinion, a difficult calculation... -Sorry, the director asks you to go to the secretariat. Would you please supervise the class? So what's going on? What happened? Oh you cry. Is it because of your parents? I thought your father returned. One day he comes and the next he stays away. And then always this quarrel with tears and shouting. I am fed up. How to study there? And the exam is in 20 days. If I fail, I'll kill myself. Kill your parents first, that's more fun. Then at least you'll make headlines. Anyway, it can't go on like this. I have to find a solution. I'm sorry I have to go again. -Yeah, I know, to your bitch. It's business how many times do I have to say that? - You can also call it that. Don't scream like that. The kid has to study. - I scream, who is screaming here? If anyone screams, it's you. -Yes, I think I have the right to do so. Did she pretend to you again at the phone, the bitch? I forbid you to speak of Maite in this way. And I forbid you to jeopardize the future of my children with your filthy whore! That's... you're crazy, aren't you! And you're a dirty..., a dirty old man which only thinks of... -I won't have have it...! You won't have, you won't have? Your beer, please! The windshield, please. -Oh it's you. Hello Lolo, how are you? - Well, surviving. What are you doing here? -I improve my pocket money as you can see. Ah, wonderful. Refuel for 50 francs, please. -Yes. Is your mom doing well? No, not particularly. At home we play tragic opera every day. I'm sorry about that. Yes it's OK. So here. -Many Thanks. You know what it's all about, huh? That's all we needed! -Why, what is it? His bunny. So howdy then. -Same to you. Will we see us soon? -Yes. Farewell. -You too. Lolo. Could you clean my windshield? And what did she say in response? -My God, what should she say? But don't ask what my father told Lolo. Olala! Well? I'll check. It's Alain. He wants to see you. He even brought a rose. Ask him what to do with it. No tell him I'm sleeping. Is it true that you are sleeping? -Can't you see that? So? Of course he didn't believe it. But at least he pretended. I'm supposed to give you this. How is it, the first time? Dad thinks Alain is too young. You know if somebody has experience, you can smell it. Then I must have a cold because I don't smell anything, honestly. I like to flirt with Alain. When I think of Brigitte, She dated Francais for two months without anything happening. And one day she said to herself: "Now or never". Devil may care. So she went to him with everything you need and stayed the night. And the funny thing is from that day, her love to Francais was gone. They soon parted. And today she would rather not had slept with him. She thinks she lost too much of herself. Of course you change. You become a different person. But that you lose yourself. You have to distinguish between love and sex with someone. The first time do it with the man you love. Or at least you think you love. You want to prove oneself. But not for the fun. There's nothing going on. At the first time. Then you gradually learn. You learn to distinguish I've always wondered why why our parents don't help us to cope with that better. And what can I do for you today, Monsieur? Uh, I'd like a l'eau de toilette. For men. No, I do not like it. Too bad now I smell nothing at all. Don't you have something else? Actually I don't know myself what I'm looking for. This is something for you. A little tart. Azzaro for men. Azzero for men? Not bad. Please tell me is Sarah there? -She has a client. Ah I understand. So I'll take this then. Uh, what does it cost? Pay at the end of the month. How am I supposed to make of that? If you want to empty my shop, buy it "en bloc". All right then. Fine. Then I'll come with a truck. Many Thanks. Goodbye. By tomorrow. Alright, we'll think about it. Many Thanks. -Yes, please. Goodbye gentlemen. Are you looking for something specific? -No. Uh, is Vanessa there? Do you want to speak to her? -Mmm. I will get her -Thank you. Your sister told me that you are here. What do you want with me? I do not know it. To be honest, I don't know myself. You once asked me if I love your father. It's strange. At the time I didn't know the answer to that. In the beginning it was just a game. And suddenly something happened. I don't know how either. But it happened. You might think it's because of the money. Of course you need money too, but I need more. I just need him, you know? That I can feel that he is here. I am so unhappy. I can't live without him. Oh my gosh, I'm played out. It's good being in the fresh air. Oh, your mother called last night. You've already been to bed. She wanted to know if it works well with you. She was very restless. She is very attached to you. Well what am I supposed to do? I do not know. Try to understand her a little bit. Don't just judge. -I don't judge anyone. But of course you judge her. You judge your father for getting a girlfriend. But then why did he came back anaway? This bond between parents cannot be broken that easily. 18 years married, that's a whole life. -You can't call that life. With not a spark of love. Life doesn't have to mean love. Hello. Hello there. -You're fine? I'm content. Did you see who just walked away? Yes. Paul. How are you at school? -Not too bad. Two weeks from now. I'm really scared. You'll do it. I'm not afraid of that. Vanessa. I want you to come home again. - Now really mom. Let's not start that again. If you ask your daughter to live at home with her parents, that's probably not too much... Is that what you call living? Surely you don't really believe that. I'm fed up with this constant grousing. Egoist, you are nothing but a callous egoist! And what you are? I have problems too. I have to do my exam. But you don't mind. You don't give a fuck, and neither does dad. Everyone doesn't care. You don't give a shit if I break down because of your constant friction. Anyway, going back is out of the question. Don't forget you're still a minor. You want to threaten me? Do whatever you want. As far as I'm concerned, go to the youth welfare office. It's all over between us. I have not choosen you. When you're unhappy, all sucks. And you piss me off, yes you piss me off. Then get lost, you piece of shit! Yes, please? Where? But I... Yes I come. What is it? Maite had an accident. An accident, what kind of accident? Suicide attempt. Daniel you will not go to her now. Don't make me mad. Let me through now or I... -Or what? Do you want to slap me? Oh what an idiot I was, a complete idiot. Daniel I warn you if you leave now, you don't need to go back. Is it supposed to go on like this, this eternal come and go? We're not a hotel. Hey I'm talking to you! Let him see how he handles it. Thats not my problem. Well, it's not as simple as that. What about you? You come and go. You do the same. I wonder if trying to get them back together was a mistake. What gives you that idea? You can see they don't love each other. Worse they hate each other. I think it's better for them to live separately. Before their hatred becomes boundless. Maybe you are right. Not maybe. 100% So if I understand you correctly is it better for them and for us that they get divorced? I take my hat off to you. So you at last got it? Has it finally clicked? Go now. I have to work. Agreed, we'll talk on the phone tomorrow. Yes, me too. Goodbye Who was that? Your friend Paul. We have met more often in the last few days. What. And why am I here if I don't know anything about it? Now now. Is my sweety piqued about it? You know mom basically men are... I don't think Julie is always right either. Some are cute though. -e.g. Paul uh? I thought that might be a little more nutritious than roses. Paul, you hit it right again. There we go. -Hey raise a little more yes. Can I help? -Yes, could you put that chair over there, please. OK. Do you hear it? Mom can laugh again. Vanessa. Vanessa. Hi. -Hello there. Hi. Have you seen your father yet? -No. He's dancing back there. -What? With Maite. -Dad dances? Come on. - Well guys, I have to see this.
