I mean, it was all so last minute, but she had nowhere to go, so of course, I offered. What happened? Her and her boyfriend got into this big fight. You know, Rex. And he kicked her out. Men. So I guess she'll be here for a while, hey? Well, until the baby comes, at least, and she gets back on her feet again. You have always been such a good friend to her. Well, she was good to me in high school, and besides, we have the room. And she's been so helpful - with Tanner. - Oh, good. Oh, hi. Speak of the devil. How you feeling, Joslyn? - Oh, not bad, Dolly. - Oh. Just taking it one day at a time. I brought these out for the kids. Thank you. Well, you look like you're just about ready to pop. Yeah. Yeah. It's getting close. Is it a boy or a girl? - I'll be right back. - I'm keeping that a surprise. Yeah, the property is huge, and we've got some serious interest from Asia. Just putting the pieces of the deal together now. Hey, honey! Sorry to interrupt. Um, table's all set. Are the burgers almost done? There's my baby. Mm. We are firing on all cylinders. I just need some cheese. You read my mind. Just only put it on half of it, alright? - I'll go get Tanner. - Yes, ma'am. Sounds like I should get into real estate, Mike. - Make some better coin. - Ah, I don't know, Bill. You got to work it 24/7. I've been doing it for five years, and it's just starting to heat up now. Tanner! Food's ready. Hey! Hey, hey, what's wrong, buddy? Asher won't let me play with them. He's mean. Oh. What does Teddy have to say about it? Don't worry. I'll be your best friend. And remember, always be a brave bear. See? You always have Teddy to play with, don't you? Alright. Let's go get some food, and then maybe we can play Hide and Seek after? Yeah? Okay. Great. - Daddy! - Ah, hey! There's my boy! Come here. Oh, son, you get better looking every day, don't you? Hey, Tanner, why don't you show these boys our birthmark, huh? Isn't that wild? We all got it. Look at this. Got that from my dad, my granddad. You can always tell a Johnson boy, because we all got it. - Ain't that right? - Okay, men, enough showing off. Come on. The food's getting cold. That's right. Let's eat. You want a hot dog? You look so happy, Paige. It's wonderful to see. I really am. Thanks for letting me stay. I wouldn't have you anywhere else. Lovely party, darling. Great food. - It's the salads. - Oh. They are always a hit. I love you. I'll see you next week. See you next week, darling. Boys! Mwah! Mwah! You're the best, Grandma! Oh, stop it, you old charmer. - Bye. - Bye. - Hi. Thanks. - Hey, come on. You guys don't want to take us Johnson on? Nah, everyone's beat. Some other time. Come on, kids. Thanks for coming. - You see, Tanner? - Thank you. Most people lack stamina. They're not willing to go the extra mile to succeed, but not us. You're going to grow up to be a winner, just like your dad. Right, buddy? Yeah! Hey. There's a little more to do out here, but I'll finish up washing up inside. Thank you, Joslyn. Well, I think that was a success. You did great, babe. Oh. Whoa. Whoa. Slow down. Slow down? Me? I got to hit the can. Help Mom with the dishes, okay, buddy? No. You... It's okay, sweetie. I'll do it. Why don't you go get ready for bed, okay? Will you and Daddy read me a story? Of course. Go. Jos, do you know where the garbage bags are? Jos? Look. I don't know what the heck you think you're doing here, but I want you out of here. You are not going to mess this up for me. You can't be here. Tomorrow, I want you out of here! Guys, what's going on? Nothing. Doesn't look like nothing. She's upset. I don't know why you brought her here. Because she's my best friend and has nowhere to go, especially with the baby coming. How is that our problem? What's the issue? She helps out around the house. I mean, you're never home anymore with work. I... I like having her here. Seriously? She had to have done something to get kicked out. I don't trust her. Okay? I don't trust her with Tanner. You should have talked to me first. Well... she's like a sister to me. I... I didn't think you would mind. Whatever. W-Wait. Where are you going? I'm going to Lucy's. A bar, Michael? Really? - I have a meeting. - Now? These meetings pay for this house, your car, put food on the table. You're... you're never home anymore, and I just... It's Sunday. You've been drinking. Excuse me? My clients love me, Paige. They call, I go. That's the gig. You don't like it, why don't you get a job? Then we can talk. Daddy, Daddy! Oh, hey, look at this handsome fella, huh? Tanner, why don't you go get ready for school, okay? Be at the door in five minutes. Must have been some meeting. Paige, I'm sorry. Yeah? For what? For what you said to me last night? Or for coming home reeking of booze? I said I'm sorry. What's going on, Mike? This is... this is starting to feel like more than just business. It... feels like you don't want to be here. Not now, babe. Well, what were you doing all night? Don't question me, Paige, okay? I said I was sorry. - Excuse me? - I told you not to question me! Let's go, buddy. Don't worry about Daddy. You're going to have a great day today, sweetie, okay? Alright. I'll pick you up after school. Love you! WoAlright. Have fun. Hello? - Hi, Mom. - Hi, darling. Is something wrong? Yeah. I... I don't know what to do. Hey. What's going on, Jos? Paige, I don't want to cause problems in your home. What problems, Jos? - I can just go. - No! Just tell me what you were talking about. I feel like I'm the only person who doesn't know what's going on in my home! No, you're not leaving! Tell me what that was all about, please! - Paige, I don't... - What was he saying to you? Ah! Jos? Okay. Okay. No, no, no. It's okay. I think the baby might be coming, okay? No, no. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. - Ah! - Okay. Okay. Can you walk? Yeah. Okay. Okay. We're going to go to the hospital. - Okay. - Okay. Hey, Mom. Can you pick up Tanner from school and give him dinner at home? Yeah. No. I have no idea where Michael is. He's not answering his phone. I just don't want her to go through this alone. Mrs. Johnson? Oh. Mom, I'll call you back, okay? Hey. Is everything alright? Yeah. Joslyn's still in labor. Uh, is the father here? No. No. Um, uh, for all intents and purposes... - I am the father. - Okay. Has, uh... has Joslyn been under a lot of stress lately? Yeah. You could... You could say that. Yeah. The baby's a little premature, but we are monitoring them both carefully. There is no need to worry. She did ask if you could wait. Yes. Yes. Okay. I guess... Hey, Mom. You with Tanner? I just got him into bed. I got to call you back. - How is she? - Joslyn did great. She had a beautiful baby boy. Ah. A boy, huh? Yeah. It was long, but she did pretty well, thank goodness. They're both sleeping now. You coming home, then? They need to keep her for observation for a few days, so I'm going to stay here, just in case she needs anything. That's fine, Paige. I'll take care of things around the house, and I'll get Tanner to school. You just stay as long you need. Thanks, Dolly, but I think I can handle it. Where were you today when I called? Mom had to go pick up Tanner. - I was working. - So you turn your phone off? Um, it's alright, Paige. We've handled it. So, they're coming back with you, are they? Where would you like them to go, Michael? Back to her ex's would be a good start. Well, that's not happening. Now, you two, that's enough. Uh, Paige, I'll bring by your clothes and things tomorrow, okay? Thanks, Mom. Look at the little baby. - Momma, Momma! - Hi, buddy! Oh! Oh, I missed you so much. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - I want to see the baby. Yeah. Okay. You have to be quiet, though, Tanner, okay? He's sleeping. Okay. Just give them some space, okay? Auntie Joslyn is tired. She needs rest. Tanner, let's go throw the ball out back. Yay! Oh. I'll take this. Go get settled in. I'll get the rest of the stuff from the car. Oh. He's perfect. He's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen and by far the best thing I've ever done. I want to give him the life I never had. You're going to be a wonderful mom, Jos. I'm scared. I don't have anything, Paige! When Rex kicked me out, I took a suitcase, and I left. I maxed all my cards out on motels. I have nothing. I need to get a job, find us a home. No, no. Don't worry about that right now, okay? We always thought we would have another kid, so we kept all of Tanner's baby stuff. So you're fine for a little while, okay? For now, just focus on this moment and enjoying this beautiful baby boy. Have you decided what you want to name him yet? Sean. - After my dad. - Oh, Sean. Hi, Sean. Okay. You need rest. I'll be right upstairs. If you need anything, just call, okay? Oh, he's got me tackled! Oh! You got me good, buddy. I want her out of the house. What? I want her gone. We can't just kick her out on the street. Well, I've had enough, Paige. We can't afford this. I let you two play house around here for a while, but now that the baby's here, we're done. - No. - Excuse me? She has a newborn, Mike. No family. I'm all that she has. I... I can't just kick her out. You know, ever since that leech moved in here, you been talking back to me. Now, I'm starting to feel like all this hard work I do for this family is going unnoticed while you two ladies are chowing down on my food - while I pay the bills. - Okay. Okay. Okay. Just... I'm sorry. Let's just give her some notice. Can she have until the end of the week? Don't test my patience, Paige. Hey, come here, buddy! Hey, hon. Oh, are... are you alright? Oh, baby! Oh. Come on. Let's get you some tea. Ugh. I don't know. Something is wrong, Mom. I mean, Michael is not himself. He's always at work. I mean, he's distant. He's totally disconnected. Have you talked to him about it? Yes, and every time I do, he just lashes out! I've never seen him get so angry. Paige, he hasn't gotten physical, has he? No, no. No, but I'm scared, Mom. Our home just doesn't feel the same anymore. You think he's having an affair? I mean... he goes out a lot at night, but I don't think so. I think I'd be able to tell. I think he might just be stressed out about work. Oh. The deal. The deal. You know what? He says everything will be finalized soon and the money's going to be amazing and we'll finally get out of debt and everything can go back to normal. Careful, honey, because once things change, they very rarely go back to the way they were. Hey. Is the baby asleep? Aw, thank you, Paige. Ugh. I feel like such a burden. No, no. I'm happy to help. Look. I, um, I actually need to talk to you about something. What's up? I... I don't know what's going on with Michael, but he's... he's just been really stressed out about work, and... and money's been tight for a while now. So, um... I feel like you might need to move out soon. I'll try to hold off as long as possible, but he can just be so bullheaded, you know? I just... Do you have anywhere else you could go? I'll figure something out. Maybe we can ask my mom. I mean, she doesn't have a ton of space, but you could always sleep on the couch. How did I get into this mess? I'm going to have to go back to bartending and... and leaving my baby with strangers at night! I don't want that! Joslyn, it's going to be okay, alright? I'm not abandoning you. We'll figure this out together. Sean. I know. I know. What are you doing? The baby was crying. You didn't hear him? Give him back. I'll put him to bed. Maybe Sean should stay with us. What are you talking about? You know. He's mine. Goodnight. Hey. Are you... are you okay? You don't look too good. I'll be fine. I just didn't much sleep last night. Yeah. No. I didn't sleep very well, either. I was thinking about what you said. And I think you're right. It's best I get out of here sooner rather than later. I found a women's shelter in Gilford with a bed available, and I'll stay there until I can get my feet on the ground. Whoa, whoa, Jos. No. A... a shelter? With a baby? Yeah. It won't be so bad. We just need to do a little bit of research, okay? And we're going to find you somewhere close to here. Oh, God. You're exhausted. How about I take the little guy upstairs, okay? And then you can get some sleep. Really? - Yes. - You don't have to. Don't worry about it, okay? I got you. Come on, Sean. Okay. Oh, I know. Oh, that's what's wrong. Oh, no. I know. I know, Sean. That's okay. That's okay. I... Ow! How could you? After everything I did for you? What? What are you talking about? I saw the birthmark, Jos. Did you think that I wouldn't see it? Oh, my gosh. Paige, wait. No! No. I want you out of this house. How could you even stay here? You... you betrayed me! You made look like a fool in my own home! Oh, my God. Did you sleep with him here? Of course not, Paige. Please listen! No! No! You have been like my sister since we were kids, and now, you have ruined everything that I care about! How could you do this to me? It's not like that, Paige! I was really drunk, okay? I didn't know what was happening! What? All I remember is someone helping me to lie down. I thought it was Rex, but... but then he got kind of aggressive. I... I promise I didn't know it was Mike until Sean was born. No. Mike wouldn't do something like that. I tried to confront him, but he threatened me, said he wouldn't let me tear his family apart. You're lying. Rex and I hadn't been having much sex, so he did the math, and he figured it out. That's why he kicked me out! No. This isn't happening. I was too afraid to tell you, Paige. - You're my best friend. - No! I don't believe you. Mike isn't the man you think he is. Hi. I need to speak to Michael Johnson. - It's urgent. - Man: Paige. What are you doing here? I need to speak to Michael. What? What... What is it, Jeff? Where's Mike? He doesn't work here anymore. What? No. No. He's working on a big deal. He has all these meetings. He said it's his biggest one yet. He left months ago. Said he had a better gig. I'm not sure what he's doing now. He didn't tell you? Paige. What can I get you? Um, I'll just have a water, please. One water coming up. Can I ask you a question? Shoot. Um, my husband comes here a lot. Do you know him? Mike? Yeah. He's in here all the time. Alone? He kind of comes and goes with different people. What kind of people? Can't really say. Do you have a... A name? Anything? Look, lady. It's none of my business. Please. Meet me outside. Tell you, he don't seem like no real estate broker to me. Why would you say that? Mike's been coming in with some pretty heavy guys lately. Guys? Thought you were going to catch him cheating, didn't you? I'm afraid what Mike's into... might be worse than that. These guys make some serious deals. Well, Mike's been working on this big real estate deal. Maybe he just went out on his own. Those aren't the kind of deals I'm talking about, if you catch my drift. D-Drugs? No. You don't know your husband very well, do you, lady? I hate to give you bad news, but, uh, he's in pretty deep. People are even scared of him now. The kind of guys he's associated with are not the kind of guys you want to mess with. Look. I can't say much more than that... except... be careful. Well, just give me a name! Don't go sniffing around. You're going to get yourself in a whole lot of trouble. Please. Got a pen? Yeah. Uh... Don't be stupid. Oh, hey, Paige. Uh, Tanner already left with Mr. Johnson. He showed up early and pulled him out of class. Said it was a surprise. Oh. Is everything okay? Yes. No. Uh, everything is fine. Um, did... did he say where they were going? Sorry. I was really busy, and I was finishing up class. - I didn't think to do... - Yeah. No, no, no. Of course. Of course. Um, thanks, Miss Bailey. Mike, you didn't tell me you were getting Tanner today. Um, can you just pick up? I want to know where you guys are. Call me back. Mike, why aren't you calling me back? Where are you? WoHey, Paige! Oh! Oh, thank goodness! There you are! Where have you been? Dad took me to the movies and the arcade. - Look at what we won, Mom. - Oh, wow! Wow! What a day you must have had! Oh, you are so sticky. Okay. Um, go upstairs and get ready for bed, okay? It's late. But wait, Mom. Listen to your mom, buddy. Well, that was one hell of a stunt. - Stunt? - Michael, I have been calling and texting you for hours! You cannot just take Tanner out of school and then disappear and not notify me and then turn off your phone! I didn't turn off my phone. Oh, so you were just ignoring me. That's even worse! Come on. We were just trying to have some fun. I wanted to celebrate. - Celebrate? - Yes, babe. The deal is moving forward. I wanted to show Tanner a good time and give you a break. I know you need to relax. To relax? I have been worried sick! Okay, okay. I should have called you. I'm sorry. Michael, you cannot do this. It is irresponsible. What if you had gotten into an accident and I didn't know where you were? He's my son! I can spend a day with him if I want! No! No, you cannot! Not like that! Not without notifying me! Do not stand here in my house and tell me what I can do with my own son! You are not listening to me! I am a good father! There is nothing in this world that I wouldn't do for that boy! If you ever try to come between us, I will... Paige? You okay? My life is ruined. What? I just wish that none of this had ever happened. I just want things to go back to the way they were, but... they can't. I just... I just want be happy. I'm so sorry, Paige. Don't! Everything is just such a... mess. Mrs. Johnson? My name is Detective Anderson. Would you like a cup of coffee? - No. - How can I help you today? Um... I... I... I have no idea where to, um, start. It says here this has something to do with your husband, a Michael Johnson. What seems to be the problem? Um... my husband isn't who he says he is. How do you mean? He's, um, been lying, and, uh... I think he might be involved in some criminal activity. I'm just... I'm worried for our safety. - You have children? - Yes. Uh, sorry. Uh, I have a son, Tanner. He's, uh, he's seven. And you don't feel safe in your home? Has he ever been violent with you in the past? No, no, not... not me, but... well, I think he might have been with my friend. Anderson: Your friend. Who is that? Uh, Joslyn Martin. Uh, she's staying with us until she can find a place. And you think that he may have assaulted her? She said she doesn't remember. Um, she was drunk and... and maybe... something else, but... I know she didn't ask for it. Did she file any charges? Have any evidence, something we can go on? Oh, I mean, the baby does have the birthmark. I'm sorry. I don't follow. Uh, uh, my... my husband has a birthmark on his stomach. He's very proud of it. Um, all the men in his family have it. It's genetic, I guess. Um, well, the... the baby... The baby has the... The birthmark. So, I guess that's proof that, um... that my husband... is the father. I see. I'm sorry. I, uh... I just... I really love my husband. He is a good father. I just... I don't recognize him anymore. What is it you'd like us to do here? He's just been acting weird ever since Joslyn moved in, and I thought that I would go and confront him myself. But when I got to his office, they told me that he hadn't been working there in months. He had been worried about some deal, and I... I just assumed it was real estate, but now, I'm think that it... it might be drugs. And what makes you think that? Well, he's been doing business, um, with this man. Roman D'Mante. Yeah. What? Do you know of him? Have you ever seen your husband with this man? Seen any sign of drugs or suspicious activity - around your house? - No. No. He... he usually goes out at night, uh, for his meetings. I'm going to have to make some inquiries. If I could get you to wait here, just for a little while... Oh, no. I can't. I have to go pick up my son at school. You say that you don't feel like you're in any danger at home right now? - No. - Okay. Go get your boy, and I will call you later tonight. Will you be free to take a phone call? Yeah. Yeah. I think I will. Alright. Here's my card. If you feel like you're in any danger whatsoever, I want you to call me right away. Do you understand? Alright. Take care, Mrs. Johnson. Who was that? Oh, no one. Just unknown number. Probably a scam. When's dinner? I am starving. Uh, it's coming up. No meetings tonight? No. Staying home to watch the game with Tanner. Oh. Hey, Jos. Oh, sorry. I didn't want to disturb you. No. Wait. Come here. Can I hold him? There he is. What a handsome boy. Maybe we should watch him for the night. Give you a break, huh? It's fine. I was just getting a snack. No, no. It's okay. Grab something to eat. Go downstairs. Relax. He can watch the game with us. You look so tired. Mike, I... I think she's fine. What's the big deal? Just babysit him for a while. You don't mind, do you? Tanner, it's game time! Let's go! Coming, Dad! It's okay. It's okay, alright? I'll watch him. Paige, the game's starting! Come on! Hello, Ms. Johnson. This is Detective Anderson. I talked to my colleague about your situation, and I'm afraid there isn't a whole lot we can do without any evidence. I shouldn't say this, but maybe if you call me back, there might be a way we can help each other out here. I got to head out. Again? It's 8:30. Oh, it's just work, honey. I'll be back in a few hours. Joslyn, I need you watch Tanner for a bit! Okay! Jeez! Um, sorry. No, I don't have any change. Sorry. No. Ugh! Babe? Baby? You awake? Babe? Hey, babe, wake up. Oh, I'm sorry I've been so hard on you lately. But I think we can fix things. Huh? I really want things to be the way they used to be. We were happy. Me, you, Tanner. All of us. No, no, Michael. I don't want to. Come on, baby. No. Michael, you can't just fix things. Sex is not going to make this go away! You're my wife, Paige. Get off of me! Good morning, sleeping beauty. Want some pancakes? Um... Tanner already ate. He's getting school stuff. Uh, you're going to take him to school? Yeah. I took the morning off. I, um, figured you could use a little time for some self-love. So, why don't you make a bath and just relax this morning? Okay? Okay. You got everything? - Yep. - All right. Let's go. See you later, sweetheart. Bye, Mom. I'm sorry. I should've believed you. You okay? My stomach is in knots. I don't recognize him anymore. I can't trust him. I have no idea what he's going to do next. Jos, I think we need to go. We? I can't do this alone. Yeah. Okay. Where are we going to go? What about your mom's? No, no. I can't do that to her after everything with my dad. Besides, it's the first place he'll look. No. We need to get far away from Mike. Far away from everything he knows. Paige, - I have no money. - That's okay. That's okay. I have the car. I have a few dollars for gas. A few dollars isn't going to get us very far with two kids to feed. I know. I know. You're right. If you can take Sean in the evenings, I can go back to the bar. We can save it up. No, no. We don't have time. I mean, who knows what trouble he's gotten himself into? Us into. We need to protect the boys. I just... I couldn't live with myself if anything happened to Tanner or Sean. Paige, you're scaring me. But if it means our sons will be safe, I'll go. How much do you think we'll need? Oh, I don't know. Between getting out of state, lodging, food, and... Four grand? We can't exactly sell the car. I could sell some of my jewelry. My wedding rings. How much do you think they're worth? I don't know. It's a start. Can I help you? Yes. I would like to sell some things. Well, you came to the right place for that. Are you kidding? That's it? What can I say? The resale is just not great on this stuff. It was my mother's. I can give you 500 bucks for it. It's worth three times that at least. Come on. I just... I really need this money. Can you just cut me a break? Throw in those earrings, and I'll make it an even thou. You enjoy taking advantage of women? Well, you know, you can't always get what you want. A thousand bucks for almost all my jewelry. I'm worthless, clearly. - You did good, Paige. - No. It's not enough. We'll leave here and be starving within weeks. I can try calling Rex. Ask for money. No, no. We're not taking anything from that dirtbag. I don't trust him as far as I can throw him. You know what? I can ask my old boss from the bar. He's a good guy and kind of a friend. He might lend us something. Hey, honey. What you up to out there? - Just something for my clients. - Ah. Where's Joslyn? Oh, she's just running errands. That's a first. Oh, don't... Don't bug him. I'm just going to get him to sleep. Well, he's a good-looking kid. I'll give him that. Are you going out? Later. I'm finalizing everything. And tomorrow is the big day, babe. It's going to change everything. I'm so excited for you. You're going to do great. Mm-hmm. I can't lose. You know, I was thinking... maybe we could adopt Sean. What? I mean, we've always talked about having another child. Joslyn can't get on her feet and is obviously overwhelmed. I could look at new houses. More space for the kids. The kids? Yeah! Tanner and Sean can be brothers. What is it? No. I'm just, um, so excited for this deal to be done, honey. Good. Why don't we go away next weekend? - Take Tanner somewhere fun. - I would love that. Where's your ring? I got... I, uh... I was just cleaning the bathroom and I think I just left them upstairs. Well, I wouldn't want anyone thinking you're a free woman. Oh, no. Don't you worry. I'm going to take a nap. I got a big night. Okay. Paige? There you are. Always lurking in the shadows, huh, Jos? Why are you so happy? Oh. You finally going to pay me some rent? You live under my roof, you pay. Michael! She's supposed to be gone. Remember? You don't want to be as useless as that deadbeat ex, do you? You just bought yourself another day. Maybe we should tell her about our little proposition. Jos, I'm sorry, okay? It's going to be okay. We're going to be okay. Proposition? What the hell was he talking about? He wants to adopt Sean. What? He wants you out of the picture so that Sean can come and live with us. He knows. He must've seen the birthmark or just assumed. I don't know. Mama? Hey, buddy. Hi. I can't fall asleep. Oh. Okay. Do you want to go upstairs and read a story? Um, okay. How about we watch a movie, huh? Okay. Yeah, yeah. Um, okay. Why don't you stay with Auntie Joslyn, all right? And I will... I'll be right back. What movie do you want to watch? - Joslyn? - Where have you been? What is it? We have the money. Where did you... It doesn't matter. Okay, go. Get everything you need, all right? We're leaving now. I don't think this a good idea, Paige. Do you have a better one? This is our chance, Jos. - But... - No. Let's just go. Okay? Now. Mommy, where are we going? We are going on a vacation. It's going to be fun. I don't want to go on a vacation. Tanner, I know that it's late. I know you're tired. But I need you to be brave, okay? Why don't you grab a toy you can bring, okay? Where's Daddy? Daddy's not coming this time. I want Daddy! I'm not going. Tanner, Tanner! It's going to be okay. But we need to go, now. Okay? Come on. Come on, buddy. All right. Oh, no. What? Do you know him? I've seen him around. Rex used to talk about him. If he has anything to do with this money, we're in deep trouble. - He'll find us anywhere we go. - Okay, okay. So, out of state isn't far enough? I don't think so. - Mama! - Oh, Buddy. Hey. - Oh, buddy. - I want Teddy. Oh, buddy. Buddy, you didn't bring him? No. Shh. You have to be quiet, okay? You have to stop crying. You're going to wake the baby. Okay. We'll get you a new teddy, okay? I want my teddy. Where are we going? - Uh... - I want Daddy! I'll go check in, okay? Are you serious? We only need it for one night. We need a credit card on file for incidentals. Yeah, yeah. We'll take it. I'm just going to go make a call. Mother: Oh, I'm so sorry, darling. Don't tell me where you are. The less I know, the better. I want you to get in touch with my cousin Raymond. He's a wonderful man. Just take this number down. And then I'll call him and I'll tell him everything that you told me. And he'll arrange to get you across the border and into Canada. Wait. Mom, what? You have to be somewhere safe, Paige, until things calm down. - Raymond will sort it all. - Mom, I don't know. I mean... Honey, what are your options? - I don't have our passports. - What? I don't know. We were leaving in such a rush, I forgot to take them. Jesus, Paige! I didn't know that we were leaving the country, Mom. Okay, okay. I will go and I will get them, and I will bring them to you. No, no, no. I don't want to get you involved. I'll just... - I'll go back. - No! Paige, that's a bad idea. Michael will be looking for you. I know. I know. It's okay. I'll be careful. I just... I won't go in if I know that he's home. Love you, Mom. Paige, I love you, too, darling. But listen to me. You be careful, okay? Leave the country? What's going on? Um... I, um... I just need you to watch the kids, okay? And I'll be back as soon as I can. No, no. It's too dangerous. If I'm not, then you have the money. So, just get a new car and keep going as planned, okay? Paige, this is crazy. If Tanner wakes up, just tell him that I went to go get his teddy. Paige? Oh, you witch. Paige? - What's going on, Paige? - Huh? You break into my shed? No, no. Let go! I know who you are. I know what you did to Joslyn! She's a liar. I know that Sean is your baby! Where are they, Paige? Where are my boys? - You're a liar and a fraud. - No, no, no. I did this for us, Paige. I did this for our family. Where are they? I hate you. Oh, why, why, why, Paige? Why? Why'd you make me do that? Huh? How could you be so ungrateful? I've literally done everything for you in your life. You really thought you could get away with this? Now, where is my money? Oof! Come on. We need to go. We need to go. Come on. Come on. - Shh. - Come on. Oh, my God. Mike, Mike. He came back. I barely made it out. I mean, I hit him with a poker. Oh, my God. If he comes to, he's going to go ballistic. If he doesn't, that's even worse. - Paige, you need to rest. - No, no, no. I can't sleep. My heart is beating out of my chest. Jos, I can't wait. I used my credit card to get in here. He's going to track us. If he's alive. Either way, we need to go. We need to go. We need to get as far away from here as possible. Okay, okay. Yeah. - Let's not wake up the kids. - Okay. Paige? Answer your phone, Paige. I want my boys back. Listen to me, you stupid... You better turn your ass around and bring my boys home. Oh, and that money you took? There's some heavy dudes behind this deal. A lot worse than me coming for you if you don't return it. You understand? It's him again. I'll just turn it off. - Phones have GPS. - Well, I know, but we can't be out here without a phone. I'll just... I'll turn it on in emergencies. What about one of those cheap phones, like in the movies? Like a burner phone? That's a good idea. And then, we can just pay for everything with cash. That way, Mike can't track us. I'm hungry, Mama. Sorry, sweetie. We are, too. Don't worry. We were just waiting for you to wake up. What happened to your eye, Mama? It was just an accident, buddy. Um, Raymond? Yeah. Hi. It's Dolly's daughter, Paige. Yeah. She said that you'd be callin'. So, do you want to come up north for a visit, then? Yeah, yeah. As soon as possible. We need to disappear for a bit. Well, I live outside a small town in the middle of nowhere, so if you want to disappear, this is the place to do it. Stay as long as you need. I know some people who can get you work, and there's plenty of odd jobs around here that need doing. That's amazing. I hear you might need some other things. Uh, yeah. We need to get across the border. - You have passports? - Yes. You'll need signed letters from the father saying it's okay to take the kids across, but don't worry. I have a friend who's pretty good at that sort of thing. But it is going to look weird if they both have the same dad, so I'll get him to make a letter for each kid. We'll overnight them to you as soon as you get an address and e-mail me everyone's details. Right. Okay. I got you pancakes. Thank you. I got pancakes, too, Mama. You did? Wow. Lucky guy. That was nice of Auntie Jos to get you pancakes. You were such a brave boy last night. You really deserve it. When's Daddy coming? Um... He's really busy with work, so I'm not sure when we're going to see him. Maybe tomorrow? Maybe. I think he'll come tomorrow. How's Sean doing? Are you making sure he's having a good time? Yeah. I was teaching him little piggy on his toes. You were? Oh, wow. He must've loved that. Hey. You want to watch your show? Yeah? Okay. So, what's up? It's all set. He lives in Newfoundland. - Wow. - Yeah, yeah. We just need to find a place that we can lay low for a few days, just while he figures some stuff out. I think I know somewhere we can go. What? Really? My family used to have a cabin. I haven't been there in years. It's pretty rustic, but it's in the middle of the woods. Sounds perfect. What? This is a lot. - We're moving to Canada now? - I know. I know. We have enough money to survive. We'll be far away and safe. Wait. What about your mom? I mean, Mike is... No. Don't worry about Mom. Thank you. She's never let a man push her around before. She's not going to start now. - Hey, Dolly. - Hmm. Well, she got you pretty good, didn't she? Where are they? Not a clue. You must've done something pretty bad, though, did you? Making her go over the edge like that. She didn't even tell me where she was going, but she said you'd probably be here, sniffing around trying to find her. She can't take my family away. It's against the law. She's his mother. - Watch your tone, Dolly. - Oh, yeah? You get off my property. And If I catch you trespassing here again, I'll blow a hole in you. How's my tone now, Mikey? Listen, Rex. I don't care that you're at work. Think. Where might have your ex have gone? I will bust your head open if you don't give me something. A cabin, huh? Wow. This place is perfect. Look at that lake. It'll need a bit of clean. Mama, there's two bedrooms and a tiny toilet. There is? Well, why don't you go pick one out for us? We'll have to wait around here anyway. I'll go into town and get some supplies. See if there's anywhere we can get those documents delivered. We'll have to be ready for anything. Doesn't look like you're just passing through. No. We're just staying for a few days. Mm-hmm. Um, I need a courier service. Is there a post office nearby? Mm-hmm. Yeah. You're looking at it. Oh. Great. Uh, I need a package delivered here. You just give them our address, and then we hold on to it until you come pick it up. - Easy-peasy. - Okay, great. - What's your name, darlin'? - Uh, Paige. Well, Paige, I'm Maeve. Now, if you don't mind my saying, you seem like you're looking not to be found. Now, you don't have to worry about a thing, because if whoever gave you that black eye comes lurking around here, I'll send them packing right back to whatever hole they crawled out of. Now, that's going to be $75. Thanks, Maeve. Um, do you sell phones, cellphones? Oh, no. Sorry. That's much too high-tech for me. No. If I don't understand it, I don't sell it. Do you have a phone I could use? Oh, yeah. Yeah. In the back office there. - You help yourself. - Okay, great. Thanks. Raymond? I've got an address. Paige? - Here. - Thank you. Tanner passed out as soon as his head hit the pillow. The baby is still sound asleep. When are you going to have the talk? Soon. I can't keep lying to him. It's going to be hard for Tanner to understand. I know. It really is amazing here. When I was a kid, we'd come here a lot. I've always remembered how I felt. At peace, free, happy. I think I could live like this if I had to. You know? If this was it. Far from the city, Rex, all my problems. You could start over. You could be anybody. All right. So, tell me again. I run and hide in the special spot, and I don't come out until you or Auntie Joslyn comes and gets us. That's right. But why, Mom? Because, um, there are some not-nice people who may come looking for us, and I just need to make sure that you are safe. What do you mean? Why isn't Daddy here to keep us safe? Because, um, Daddy is sick. - Sick? - Yeah. He just doesn't know what he's doing. What kind of sick? Um, it's like in a movie when a good guy does something naughty and it turns him into a bad guy. Daddy's the bad guy? He's not safe for us right now, okay? Tanner, Tanner, I know this is so hard. I want to go home. I know. I know. Me, too. But I promise you, I will always be here for you. I will protect you. Okay? Okay. You want to race back to the cabin? How'd it go? How do you convince your son that his biggest hero is now a villain? I think I just need to leave it now and just give him some time. I'm sorry, Paige. That's tough. I'm going to head into town. See if those documents are done. You going to be okay here on your own? I'll play a game or something with Tanner. Try and cheer him up. Okay. I won't be long. Oh, hi, darling. There's a message for you out back. Oh, great. Thanks. Hey, Raymond. Paige, the letters are ready. Everything looks great. I'll send them off today. - Probably arrive tomorrow. - That's wonderful. And you shouldn't have any trouble if you cross at Houlton. It's a sleepy border. The guy who runs the booth is about to retire, and he's probably not interested in his job anymore. I cannot thank you enough. No problem, honey. Let's just get you over that border, okay? Thanks, Maeve. Um, do you have bullets for a sporting rifle? What, you mean, like, a .22? Yeah. Touchdown! So, Teddy, how was that? Shh-shh-shh. Where's Tanner? He's playing somewhere. And how's my baby boy, huh? Aw. Mommy Bear protecting her cub. He'll never be yours. I wouldn't be so sure of that. You two were really stupid enough to think that you could get away with this. Taking my money and my boys. My legacy. I will find you wherever you go. I will haunt you like a ghost. You've ruined my life! And now, you're going to pay, witch. Daddy? Hey, buddy. Oh, I missed you so much. You having fun out here? What are you doing to Auntie Joslyn? We're just having a little talk. Mommy was right. What's that, buddy? You're a bad guy. No, no. That's not true. You know how much Daddy loves you. Mommy is a liar. Run, Tanner! Run like Mommy told you. Run! Argh! Tanner? Where are you, buddy? Come talk to me. I can explain. Where is my wife? She went into town. If I don't call her every 10 minutes, she'll know something's wrong and call the police. Liar! There is no cell service out here. Now, where is she? I told you, she went to town. To get supplies. Tanner? Come see Daddy. Tanner? - Tanner! - Mama. Are you okay? Are you okay? Okay. Do you know where they went? Okay. Um, you remember what I told you to do, right? You stay here and you be very, very quiet, and only come out if Auntie Joslyn or I come and get you. Mama, I'm scared. Please don't leave me. Shh, sweetie. Be brave, okay, sweetie? You need to be a brave bear, all right? I promise you, it'll be okay. All right? I won't be long. I will come back. Here. Teddy will keep you safe. I love you so much. I don't know what I would do without you. Tanner? Stay here. Please, Michael. Stop this. Just shut up! Please just let me go back and get the baby. - He can't be there alone. - He will be fine. As soon as I find Tanner, I'll grab Sean and I'll go. He's mine. You can't have him. These are my boys and my family. - You have no part in it! - I won't let you take him. Shut up. Shut up! Shut up! You'll never find him. Where is Tanner? You have some sort of escape plan, huh? Where is he? Don't worry. I'll be your best friend. And remember, you should always be a brave bear. I'll be your best friend. And remember, always be a brave bear. Oh, you're dead. Tanner, Tanner! Oh, Tanner, why? Why, why, why, would you do that? It's Daddy. Mommy attacked me, okay? You saw that, right? Mommy? Mommy is crazy. You're bad! Mommy, help! Tanner, run! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. Tanner, Tanner, Tanner. I love you, buddy. Oof! You son of a witch. Are you okay? Are you okay? I'm okay, Mama. I'm okay. Okay, okay. The baby. Go. Go get him. Get some rope! Was I brave, Mama? You were so brave. Sweetie, you did great. I'm sorry we couldn't have acted sooner. Vice looked into your husband, and it turns out he was brokering a deal between the Chinese and the biker gang led by Roman D'Mante. You're not going to get away with this, Paige. You kidnapped my kid. I just came to get him back. It's my right as a father! I didn't do anything. Your husband disappeared with all the money right before the deal went down, and everything went sideways. Is your friend going to be okay? She looks a little beat-up. Yeah. Yeah. She'll be okay. She's as tough as they come. We found your husband's car down the road, There was no money in it. You say you have no idea about any of this? No. No. After I came to you, we decided it was safer if we just came here to get away from him. Yeah. Well, there's going to be a lot of dangerous men looking for that money. Whoever does have it, I hope they know what they're doing. Thanks, detective. Is Daddy going to jail, Mama? I don't know, buddy... but I think so. Tanner? The food's ready. Come on. Does you want a present? Okay.
