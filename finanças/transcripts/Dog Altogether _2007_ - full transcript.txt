Subtitling made possible by Acorn Media Where are you taking me? To the garden of earthly delights. Change? What kind of change? I'm not sure, exactly. When H.G. Wells was visiting, he made a most peculiar comment. He said that he could tell there was something missing from my life and that he hoped I would find it. That's rather presumptuous of him. Yes, it was. The odd thing is... he was right. You're so beautiful. I dream about you every night. Oh, Luther. But I thought you loved your work. I do. And it goes without saying that I enjoy working with you. But I'm a doctor, William, not a detective. You'd make a very good one, however. If you like, I could put a word in with the superintendent. I was the only woman attending medical school in Montreal. And it was very important to me that I succeed. And you have. I'm the only one from my class still cutting up cadavers. The Hippocratic Oath was wasted on me. What is it? What did I do? There are a hundred good doctors in this town, but only one that can do what you do. William. Julia, you have a gift. I thank you for that, but this is not just about my work. What, then? It appears we're needed again. She hasn't been here long. Fewer than 12 hours, I'd estimate. She was strangled. So it would appear. What have you, George? This young lad and his lady friend found the body, sir. What were they doing out here? Just having a stroll in the woods, so they say. No blood, no signs of a struggle. Perhaps the body was moved here, sir. At least we know who she was. "Miss Abigail Tunstall." And an address on Wellesley Street. Oh, my. Sir, according to Miss Tunstall's landlady, she was a kitchen hand. Quite the wardrobe for a kitchen hand. I daresay. I can't imagine she was chopping cabbage or curdling cheese in these fineries. How did she afford all of this clothing, I wonder? Well, perhaps, sir, she's just one of those women who can really spot a bargain. You know, my Aunt Primrose says that any girl can dress like a lady if she has an eye for value. A true font of wisdom, your aunt. Not according to my Aunt Iris, who has a rather low opinion of Aunt Primrose. Called her a gluttonous imbecile once. Not to her face, but... George, how many aunts do you have? Oh, let's see. There's Aunt Amaryllis, Aunt Aster, Aunt Azalea, Aunt Begonia, Aunt Bryony. Thank you, George. Oh, sir, that's just the A's and B's. You can fill me in on the C's through Z another time. Well, I'll look forward to that. We'll have some tea. Oh, my goodness. Sir, I think you'll want to have a look at these. Oh, my. Rather saucy. Indeed. Looks like our girl was into some risky business. Yes. Perhaps that's the reason why Miss Tunstall has turned up dead. She died some time between midnight and 2:00 a.m. What can you tell me about her attacker? A man, judging by the size of the hand. And a few inches taller than her, by the angle. Any other injuries? Any interference? No sign of that. Small comfort. Such a beautiful girl. Such a pity she had to end up this way. Not entirely unexpected. Oh, William, just because she posed for titillating picture postcards. It's a fact that women in this line of work invite unhealthy attention. They "invite" it? Well, attract it. Pornography sets men's minds to dark urges. From what you've described, the postcards in question were hardly pornographic. Yes, well, perhaps they were more than enough for her killer. You'll have my report by the end of the day. Very good. Dr. Julia Ogden. Dr. Folwell. Yes, I did receive your letter. Tomorrow evening would be perfect. I look forward to it. Okay, lads, let's have those back. No, no, no, here. Give me those. Give. Oh, very funny. Have some respect for the dead for Pete's sake. Oi! Oi! What's all the racket? Sir, I... Whatever it is you're up to, pack it in and get back to work. And, Crabtree, I expect you to set a better example. - Me, sir? - Murdoch. You and Happy Dafty, my office. Happy Dafty! What did you do? Well, what's this girl's story? Miss Tunstall worked in the kitchen at the King's Goose Tavern. She finished her shift and left just after midnight. Some bloke followed her out? No one saw anything. Any boyfriends? According to her workmates at the tavern, there was no one special. Let me see these. Hmm. Nice. Inspector, really. I was referring to the quality of the work. The composition is professional, and the paper stock is... Well, the paper stock is top-notch. The paper stock, sir. First thing I noticed. Judging by these, I'd suggest a visit to my old friend Marcus Evans. Ah. That's perfect. I thought I told you to shut this place down. - George, the girls. - Ladies. It's a pleasure to see you again, Sergeant Brackenreid. It's inspector. Moving up in the world, I see. Unlike you, Evans, still crawling around in the gutter. - Let me see this camera. - Not my camera. Shift, Evans. It's evidence. Evidence of what? My work is purely artistic. Artistic. Tell that to the wives of the husbands who buy your trash. Oh, and this time, it's not just about saucy postcards. Perhaps you recognize this woman. Abigail. What of her? She's one of your models, then. Was. She quit awhile ago. I haven't seen her since. She's been found dead, Marcus. Any theories? Oh, no. Oh, poor Abby. Mr. Evans, do you know of anyone who may have wanted to harm Miss Tunstall? No one. She was... Everybody liked Abby. Except whoever did her in. Sirs, I've taken their names and addresses. I'll get full statements once they get some clothes on. Grab any negatives, Crabtree. Please. I can't afford to replace those. And the camera. Not the camera, Inspector. This is my livelihood. A young lady in your employ is dead. I think it's time for a career change, sunshine. Miss. Is there something else, Miss... Mahoney. Moira Mahoney. Miss Mahoney. You knew Abigail, didn't you? Yes. Me and Abby were pals. In that case, I'm terribly sorry for your loss. Have you any idea who may have wanted to harm her? No, but... The thing is, when Abby quit here, she went on to something else. Something else? There was an apartment. Abby took men there. She asked me if I wanted in on it. I thought about it. Miss Mahoney, it's all right. I'm only interested in who may have wanted to harm Abigail. I went along once, but changed my mind before I ever went inside. It was... It wasn't right. Do you recall the address? It looks like a doxie's digs, sir. It certainly does. It would appear Miss Tunstall was involved in more than just cheeky pictures. What did you find, George? Just a small kitchen and a water closet. A darkroom. Yes, but the question is, what's it doing in a doxie's apartment? A hobby, perhaps? George, go and turn the light on in the boudoir. George, come and have a look at this. Oh, my goodness! A mirror you can see right through. It's a half-silvered mirror, George, used in scientific experiments to split beams of light. I suspect the use in this case is somewhat less scrupulous. Sir, imagine we had one of these at the station in the interview room. We would be able to observe suspects without them ever knowing we were there. Yes, but in this case, I believe the intention was to take photographs of people without their knowledge. People in the bed. Yes, George. What have you there, sir? A hinge. This is a camera? It's no bigger than a cigar box. Remarkable, isn't it? It's the latest from the Eastman Kodak Company... The Pocket Kodak. But the plates? How do they fit? Oh, sir, plates are a thing of the past. George Eastman has introduced a new type of flexible film made of cellulose. It stays inside the camera. What will they think of next? So, what are you doing? You've been at that half an hour. Trying out different combinations. I thought you'd cracked it. And what's the bloody stethoscope for? Oh, sir, you can hear the bolt pass over the first tumbler. The other two are trial and error, I'm afraid. Well, that's 60 numbers. Times another 60. Yes, and each number has a leeway of one digit either side, making it a total of 400 combinations of which I have tried 76. Murdoch, just drill the bloody thing. Don't look so smug. What's inside? Money. Photographs. Oh, my. Oh. These make Evans' postcards look like an invitation to a church social. Look closer, sir. Good God. Alderman Merrick. Clarence Chislett, the district court justice. Ooh, I'll be years trying to forget these. A record was kept of the names and addresses. All important toffs. Was it blackmail, then? I'd be willing to wager these men would pay a lot of money to be sure these photographs were never seen. And it wouldn't take much for a beauty like Miss Tunstall to lure them back to the apartment. I wonder who took these photos? This could be our answer now. What have you, George? Sir, according to the landlord, the apartment was leased two months ago by a John Smith. John Smith. John Smith, George. Clearly, that's not his real name. Oh. So, how do we find him? George, this is a brand-new camera. Telegraph the Eastman Kodak Company and find out which stores in Toronto carry this specific model. Sir, right away. Dangerous game they were playing. One of these "clients" could have done Miss Tunstall in? Yes. They would have had motive. We'll interview all of them. Tread carefully, Murdoch. These "gentlemen" carry a lot of clout. More of the same? No. These photographs were taken elsewhere. Different vintage, older. Why, yes, Mrs. Pendrick. Is this a social call? How wonderful. Ice water? Sir. Sir, it's Sally Pendrick. Detective Murdoch. What fiendish crime of mine brings you here this time? Mr. Pendrick. I apologize for my unannounced visit. What do you think of my latest concept, Detective? The Toronto of the future. Millions of people living in fully self-sufficient towers, connected by a vast grid of underground railways and elevated paths, fed by endless acres of rooftop farms. Whole generations never need set a foot outside, working and playing in the sheltered security of their tower communities. That's fascinating. Actually, I'm here to speak with your wife. I see. And I trust you don't intend to accuse her of some dastardly deed. Not at all. I have an art question for her. Ah. One of those urgent art questions. At any rate... Wait here. I'll see if I can find her. Art question. A model of the solar system. You and James, both fascinated by such things. Mrs. Pendrick. To what do I owe the pleasure? Actually, it's imperative that I speak to you in the utmost privacy. Certainly. What could possibly demand such intimacy? This. Oh, my God. It was found during the course of a murder investigation. - Murder? - Yes. A young woman named Abigail Tunstall was found murdered yesterday. Possibly by the man who took these photographs. I... I'm sorry. I must sit. Yes, of course. I was young and without prospects. He offered me money. Good money. Who did? His name was Colin McTavish. He kept an apartment in Albany. I was to bring men to the apartment and entice them to disrobe. That was all. I never prostituted myself. You must believe me. Did you know he was blackmailing the men in the photographs? I didn't want to know. But it doesn't surprise me. He's been blackmailing me. Apparently, he saw my photo in The Gazette and remembered me. He threatened to show the photos to James. How much? So far, $1,500. So far? Well, he keeps coming back to the well every couple of months. I'm due for a payment any day now. Why didn't you come to me? I was ashamed, of course. If only one could erase all the poor decisions of one's past. Should this Colin McTavish contact you again... I'll let you know immediately. Detective Murdoch? I beg you not to mention this to James. He knows nothing of my past. It would devastate him. Uh, sir. I spoke with a retailer who said he sold a black leather Pocket Kodak just three weeks ago. Oh. Have we a name, George? The buyer was a Mr. McTavish. First initial C. Said he was a nature photographer. Well, that's one way of putting it, I suppose. The initial C stands for Colin. He hails from New York State. He's been blackmailing Mrs. Pendrick as well. That's quite the gold mine, there, sir. Indeed. But if the past is any indication, he'll be back for more. And then we'll have him. Colin McTavish. Do you think he's our killer, sir? He could be. But then, so could any of the men in those photographs. Have we identified them all? Uh, all except for this fellow, sir. And his name wasn't on the list you found. Keep looking, George. Sir. You seem cheerful. Do I? I must have forgotten myself. I came by to see if you would like to have a walk with me this evening. We never got a chance to finish our conversation yesterday. Yes. I would love to, truly, but I have an engagement. Ah. A meeting? A dinner, actually. With a colleague. A business dinner. Perhaps another time, then. Yes. Yes, another time. - Sir. - What have you learned, George? Sir, all the men confirmed are receiving copies of the photographs in the mail. Along with threats to make the photographs public if the monies weren't paid. You're correct, sir. $50 in most cases, mailed to a post-office box here in town. $50 is substantial but hardly worth killing over. - I - shouldn't think so, sir. Alibis? They all gave a complete account of their actions the day Miss Tunstall was murdered, including Judge Chislett, who, in fact, admitted to accosting Mr. Evans at one point, thinking that Evans was behind the blackmail note. But you found them to be truthful? I think so, sir. Embarrassed, mostly. At any rate, I have Higgins confirming their alibis. Discreetly I hope. Although one of these men could be our killer, the rest are simply victims of blackmail. Of course, sir. Excuse me, sir. Colin McTavish was released from New York State Penitentiary last June. They're sending his Bertillon measurements. Thank you, Constable Worsley. Well, that would explain McTavish's sudden re-emergence. "Dear Sally, I very much enjoyed our last meeting and thought it was time we meet up again unless you'd prefer that your husband learn your true nature." As frightening as this is, Mrs. Pendrick, it's precisely what I'd hoped for. I want him apprehended as badly as you do. Will I be required to testify? We have him on a number of other blackmail charges, and he's our number-one suspect in Miss Tunstall's murder. I see no reason for you to have to take the stand. He's expecting you at 8:00. I suggest we leave at quarter to the hour. So I meet him, give him the money, and leave. We'll have other men posted nearby. The moment you're clear, they'll move in. And I'll be safe? McTavish has no reason to harm you, Sally. It's clear he intends to continue demanding money. I'll put an end to that tonight. Dr. Julia Ogden, I presume. - Why, yes. - I'm Dr. Martin Folwell. I'm delighted to meet you in person. Thank you. So, what shall you have? A glass of champagne perhaps? Champagne? Well, I am endeavoring to woo you, Dr. Ogden. You must allow me my methods. We'll be late. He'll wait. Of all the outcomes I ever imagined for myself, here I am with my future dependent on the retrieval of a sordid photograph. There's a certain dark humor in it. Yes, I suppose. I do wish you hadn't learned of my indiscretions, Detective. That's long in the past. Yes. But your respect means a great deal to me. I just hope... My respect for you is undiminished. To your lovely city. I do believe it is almost as attractive as Buffalo. Yes, I've heard it said. Well, I'm most interested to hear more about your new hospital, of course. The Children's Hospital of Buffalo. A nurturing environment dedicated to our most vulnerable. We have high hopes. Well, I imagine it would be quite effective to have a staff dedicated solely to the treatment of children. That's it, precisely. And as I mentioned in my letter, such a progressive hospital would do well to have a female physician as our head of pediatric surgery. Is that something that you would consider? I used to sing. Growing up in Montreal, my dream was to become a famous soloist. I was quite good, actually. Unfortunately, my parents thought singing to be a sordid career choice. So I ran away to New York. Took some voice lessons. I did a bit of performing. You didn't pursue it? I ran out of money. Living in New York City, I could barely feed myself. Do you know what that's like, Detective? I can only imagine. I was hungry, alone, and terrified. Easy prey for someone like Colin McTavish. He convinced me that I could support my singing career if I moved to Albany to start working for him. And I believed him. How I regret that now. That's close enough. Driver! Whoa! Right. The warehouse is just ahead. Return immediately upon completing the transaction. I have men posted all around the warehouse. They won't make a move until you're safely out. Sally! Sally! Sally, can you hear me? Sally? What happened? There was an explosion. Are you all right? I think. It's just a small cut. Oh, God. If we had arrived just a moment earlier... Indeed. McTavish. George, have the men take a look. There might still be someone inside. Sir. Sally! Sally. Sally, you're hurt. No, I'm fine. What in God's name are you up to, Murdoch? Are you trying to get my wife killed? The more pertinent question, Mr. Pendrick, is "What are you doing here?" Did you follow Sally? That's Mrs. Pendrick to you, sir. Her well-being is my concern. Why exactly did you bring her here? That's police business. Your police business risked my wife's life. I'll be making that point to your superiors. Sir, there's a man inside the building. Dead or alive? Very much dead, sir. It's Colin McTavish. The Bertillon measurements leave no doubt. Most of the blast wounds are on his right side. This embedded debris. Yes. Flying shards of wood and metal and glass. Beyond that, the state of the body is making the postmortem rather difficult. That's unfortunate. Any word on the cause of the explosion? The fire chief seems to think it was a gas leak. You don't sound convinced. Well, it's the timing. Just at the moment when Sally Pendrick was supposed to enter the building. Yes. How is she? She had quite a close call. She's shaken, but she'll be fine. You must be relieved. Yes, quite. Julia, are you concerned about the nature of my relationship with Mrs. Pendrick? Is that the cause for this distance between us? No. I promise, William. It's nothing to do with Sally Pendrick. If the explosion was the result of a gas leak, as the fire chief suggests, something ignited a room full of gas. McTavish lighting a cigar. - Or a lamp. - Either of those. The resulting explosion would have sent debris outward in all directions like this. However, McTavish's injuries were concentrated to the right side of his body, as if the explosion came from one side of the room. What would have caused that? I don't know. I'd like to return to the warehouse and take another look. If McTavish was murdered, it's most likely it was the same person who killed Abigail. I'll wager it was one of their blackmail victims. Except, sir, all those men have alibis for the night of Miss Tunstall's murder. Well, we must have missed something. Have we interviewed all of them? Everybody except for this chap that we haven't been able to identify. Right. George, enlarge that photograph. And make copies. Perhaps someone at another station can identify him. Sir, will do. What's all this? The remnants of a bomb, sir. This pile of leavings? It was found at the blast site. So, no gas leak. There was a ruptured gas line, but that was as a result of the explosion, not the cause of it. What do you plan on doing with all this? If I can determine how the bomb was made, perhaps it will lead us to who set it. The answer lies in reconstructing the bomb. You can do that? I can try. Dr. Ogden is asking for you, sir. It's quite curious, but there's no doubt about it. Colin McTavish was dead before the explosion occurred. There's no trace of searing or ash inside the lungs. And how long has he been dead? Not long. Perhaps a day or two. Why would anyone go to the trouble of blowing up a dead body? Why, indeed? And the actual cause of death? I'm still trying to determine that. Thank you, Doctor. I must be off. Sir, I've enlarged the photograph. Did you make copies? Not yet. I thought you should have a look first. Hmm. I still don't recognize him. Not him, sir. Her. Look in the mirror. That's not Abigail. No, that's Moira Mahoney. She's the one who stayed to speak with us at Marcus Evans' studio. Miss. So it is. Now, she swore up and down, sir, she was never in that apartment, but there she is. In the flesh so to speak. Well done, Crabtree. Bring her in. - Immediately. - Will do. Detective. Mrs. Pendrick. Is your husband here? Why, no, he's at the office. Good, good. Sally, you have to leave here. You're in danger. What in the world are you talking about? That explosion... It wasn't a gas leak. It was a bomb. And I believe it was meant for you. Me? Well, how do you know? McTavish was already dead when the bomb went off. Somebody else lured you to that building, knowing you'd arrive just in time for it to explode. Goodness. But why leave here? I can think of only one person who would want both you and McTavish dead. Your husband. Mr. Pendrick must have found out about your involvement with McTavish. He must have overheard us talking. He was in another part of the house. Perhaps he has hidden microphones. I hardly think. How did he know you would be at that warehouse? He followed us. He said as much on the carriage ride home. He was concerned about your attentions towards me. I believe he lured you to that warehouse. The note came from Colin. Perhaps Mr. Pendrick forged the note. Or killed McTavish after he wrote it. No. That can't be. I've always believed someone else was behind the Rembrandt theft. Four people died in that incident, one of them shot by your husband. James shot Luca Carducci to save your life. Or to silence him. And what about the Eugenics Society? What about it? James was not responsible for Linus Malling's death. Still, his views on the matter are entirely sinister. I believe your husband is a dangerous man. Well, I simply don't believe you. James would never hurt me. Mr. Pendrick has the technical capability of building an explosive device. And so do many people. What proof do you have, hmm? Sally, please. For your own safety. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave, Detective. And it's Mrs. Pendrick. - But... - I'm quite serious. Get out. My office, George. Oh, sir, you should know, the inspector's in the interview room with Moira Mahoney. She's the one in the photo with the mystery man. Really? Hmm. George, these are the remnants of an exploded bomb. It's my intention to put it back together. - Oh, you're serious. - Yes. But first I need you to clean the carbon residue off of every piece. I don't know who that girl is. Look in the mirror. Look closer. It was just the one time, I swear. I'm not that kind of girl. Really? You didn't have any problem stripping down for Marcus Evans. That was different. I never had to go starkers, and no one ever touched me. I'm not a doxie! I don't care if you're the whore of Babylon. I want to know everything you know about this operation, starting with him. Who is he? I don't remember his name. Rubbish! Abby knew him. I didn't. I never seen him before or since. How did you choose your marks? I didn't. I told you. I wanted no part of it. How did Abigail Tunstall know which men to approach? - She had Mr. Evans' client list. - She stole it? She didn't have to steal it. Mr. Evans gave it to her. Oh, is that so? Abby told him she wanted to know which men liked to buy the postcards of her. So then Abigail contacted these men and invited them up to the apartment. How many of these so-called gentlemen were on the list? A lot. Abby was very popular. I wasn't nearly so. Evans just handed over the list, did he? Well, he didn't know what she wanted it for, did he? If he had known, he never would have agreed. Why? Because of his abiding moral conscience? No. Because it would have broken his heart. He was crazy in love with her. They were lovers? No. She'd never let him. If he'd known what she was doing, it would have killed him. I'm not convinced, sir. I still think Pendrick planted the bomb in that warehouse. You're always on about bloody Pendrick. Sir, he had motive, and he was in the vicinity of the warehouse when it exploded. You're barking up the wrong tree, Murdoch. Evans is our boy on this one. He was in love with Abigail Tunstall, who ditches him for McTavish, and just as a final kick in the old plums, she takes his client list. Evans has motive to kill the both of them. All right, let's go. Hats and coats. You never learn, do you? Just wait there. It's time to come clean, Evans. I don't know what you're talking about. Abigail Tunstall and Colin McTavish. You killed them. - I did not. - Your best girl. Your little angel. Do you want to see more? No. There are dozens of them. All of Abigail Tunstall and your ex-clients. It must have driven you insane, knowing that Abigail ditched you for that sort of business. You've got it all wrong. I didn't know why Abby left the studio. The love of your life, and you didn't bother to find out why? Bollocks! She had them lined up around the block, Evans. She was making money hand over fist, her and McTavish, blackmailing your clients. I don't know what you're talking about. Well, that's funny, because Judge Chislett told us that he confronted you. You knew, didn't you? What was it like knowing what the love of your life was doing with all of these men? Any man, in fact, but you. Stop it! Stop it. What were you doing between midnight and 2:00 a.m. on October 3rd? I don't remember. It was three days ago. I'll tell you what you were doing. You had your fat fingers around her pretty little neck. You killed her, Evans. And you killed McTavish. I didn't kill McTavish. I never even set eyes on him. I wish I had done him in, though. Instead of Abigail? I didn't mean to. I just wanted to show her how much she'd hurt me. She was so heartless. I lost my temper. I remember grabbing her, shaking her. The next thing I knew, she was dead. What about Sally Pendrick? How does she figure into this? Sally who? Evans had a reason to kill Abigail and McTavish, but not Sally. While Pendrick may have wanted to have McTavish and Sally dead, but not Abigail Tunstall. Thank you. So we're dealing with two separate crimes. One of which involves James Pendrick. You know you're treading on dangerous ground. Pendrick has already complained to the chief constable about you. - If you're wrong... - I'm not wrong. Not this time. So, what's the plan? At the moment, I have a bomb to put back together. Interesting. So, sir, the explosive material was contained in this metal pipe section, yes. That's right. And this is the remains of a timing device of some sort, which would have been attached to a blasting cap... Which would have ignited the explosive material once the timer reached 8:00. That's right, but some of the pieces appear to be missing. Unless they've been blown beyond recognition. Well, sir, I think this piece is for your lot. It's a cog wheel of some sort. Ah, George, what country of origin would you say begins with the letters S-W? Oh, there's several I can think of, sir. Swansea. That's in England, I believe. Uh, Sweden. Swaziland, I think, is a real place. Switzerland, George. Switzerland. And what are the Swiss famous for? Chocolate. Cheese. Cheese with holes in it. Clocks! George, the Swiss are famous for fine Swiss clocks. And fine Swiss clocks require fine clock wheels. George, I need you to run another errand for me. Detective, please! James Pendrick, you are under arrest for the murder of Colin McTavish and the attempted murder of your wife, Sally Pendrick. Really, Detective, you've outdone yourself. This is no laughing matter. This is a clock wheel from the timing mechanism of the bomb that almost killed your wife. Yes. And? It's identical to the clock wheels used in this remarkable model that I was so impressed with months ago. So it matches. That means nothing. These clock wheels are very rare and not readily available here. I had my constable check with the manufacturer in Switzerland. And they confirm a shipment of several of the clock wheels were sent to a Pendrick Steel Company in Toronto. A record of the transactions is in the mail as we speak. You're dead wrong, Detective. I've heard that before, sir. You'll regret this, Murdoch. Darling, don't be concerned. I'll be home before dinner. Dr. Folwell. What a pleasure to see you again. So, this is your headquarters. A rather dreary one, I'm afraid. Tchaikovsky, is it not? Yes. From his Opus 35. So, do I have good news to take back to my colleagues at the children's hospital? Oh, really, so soon? I haven't even had a chance to discuss this with my family. There's no immediate rush. But I take it you're not saying no. I must admit I have been contemplating a change. Yes. A grim business, always dealing in death. It can be, yes. And the chance to heal children... I look forward to your decision, then, Doctor. Good day. I'm afraid I was rather high-handed earlier. I apologize. In spite of the circumstances, this must be very difficult for you. It is difficult. But, truly, it is I who should apologize. I've turned a blind eye to my husband's faults. Your husband's a very clever man. Yes, and you were right about him all along, it seems. I owe you my life. I must confess to a concern. How will you fare on your own? Always come out all right. One way or another. Mrs. Pendrick. Sally. Sally. If you're ever in need of assistance, I would be honored if you were to call on me. Thank you, Detective. I might just do that.
