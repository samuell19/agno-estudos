- Captain, who's surgical officer today? - Webbe, Pre-op. - How we doing soldier? - Not too bad major. Penetrating chest wound. - Much pain here when you breathe? - Yes sir. Get this man to surgery as soon as the table's open. Got a special case for you Jed. The line forms to the right on special cases. - This one was hit only 20 minutes ago. - Oh? Hey, Bill? - What exactly are your duties sergeant? - Keep the circus moving ma'am. Anything else? Like most soldiers, I try to stay alive lieutenant. Sure glad to see you lieutenant. - Thanks a lot. - Hiya soldier? A girl... - Cigarette? - Yeah. Come on, go on, go. Get down. All right, down. Hit the dirt, down. Oh. What are you trying to do, win the war single-handed? Those men, they could've been killed. Unhappily lieutenant, we always have plenty of casualties but never enough nurses. - But a nurse's duty... - There's the all clear. But a nurse's duty to a hospital is to see... The duty of this hospital is to save what casualties we have, not to make new ones. - You just get in? - Yes sir. Ruth Mccara, replacement from Tokyo, reporting for duty sir. I'm glad to have you aboard. Those are your quarters over there, latrine is to the right, the showers are to the left. The front is up to the north a little way but I wouldn't rush right up there. The generals got things pretty well in hand. - Yes sir. - Please stop doing that, will you? - Did you get the class 6? - No sir, no written orders, no scotch. - You're losing your touch. - I did bring the 3 nurses though. Our army's secret weapon. - You sound like I better find you a bottle. - Major? Phone, division surgeon. It doesn't have to be full, you know. We'll be operational at new area Dog sugar 6-7-4-2... 2-7-4-0. 1200 tomorrow. - Better get your show on the road. - How soon? I say how soon? - Right away. - Move at night? That's up to you. I said, that's up to you. - You know the capabilities of your own unit. - Yes sir. - Better get your rubes out. - Which way do we go? Up or back? - Up. Let's see, we're here, up to here. - Got it. We want to dodge off the highway by dirt road. For evacuation of patients there's a railroad spur about one mile to the west, right here. - Move out at dawn as usual. - No, now. By the time I get this show on wheels, it'll be dark. What's that to do? Interfere with your sack time? No sir. Colonel Whalters won't want us to move out at night. Well, when he gets back, he can change my orders. Call the base depot, get colonel Whalters on the phone. Well, I'll go up by copter and take a look at the new position. You're in charge until either I or Whalters get back. Evacuate all transportable patients, here's the dope. Right. - Any luck? - No sir, not yet. Major... Nothing sir. What's the matter? Can't you get these tents up at night? Oh yes sir, we can get them up, if you can get them there. - I can't locate colonel Whalters sir. - Well, keep trying. Yes sir. If I place the receiving tent down there, east to west... how does that affect your landing strip? Seems Ok. All right, let's go home. - Mash 66 to windmill 13951, over. - Mash 66. Windmill 13951 to mash 66, go ahead, over. Pick up casualty, take him to base hospital. Position of casualty, Hill 212. Repeat, 212. Area marked by smoke bomb. Cautios, enemy rifle fire. Over. Bring him over here. There's a couple more up there major. - One is our medic. - What? There's a couple more up there major, one is our medic. - Radio said there was only one casualty. - That was 10 minutes ago. A medic is not supposed to get hit. That boy is hurt pretty bad Rusty, put him in the other pod. This man goes in the cockpit. We'll try to keep them down, so long. Thank you. Herb, keep them covered until they get out. - How is the shower? - Cold honey, cold as a brass monkey. Center poles down. All right, pull out. - Center poles down. - Center poles down. - Side poles. - Side poles. - Down. - Down. - Heave. - Heave. Heave. Ok, take it out of here. Excuse me, I think the war is over. Well, the tents are coming down, I just saw them. Hit that road, tote that barge, pack, unpack, move, stop. Move? I just got unpacked. Tough, we've only been here 4 days ourselves. Don't we get any notice before we have to move? - Front lines move, we move. - Yeah, but 7 moves in 23 days? - You got to keep loose in the army. - It's kind of like a real circus, isn't it? Hey, did you hear? - Yeah, the war is over. - Orders say we're moving tonight. - May I, honey? - No, you smell already. - Why at night? - Oh, Jed's orders. - Since when major Webbe become Jed to you? - Oh, I'll get a ring out of him yet honey. - Where? Through your nose? - May I, honey? Toilet water. Say, this major Webbe, what kind of a person is he? - Why? - I met him. - Oh? - Oh brother, whatever I did, it was wrong. - What is it you did honey? - Nothing, absolutely nothing. I was tending some sick soldiers and suddenly he attacks me. In broad daylight? Don't do this, do this. Don't do that, do that. Oh, May I have my comb? Thank you. What's the matter? Doesn't he like nurses or something? Oh, he likes them fine, but only in their place. - It's a good thing to remember honey. - You too honey. - Heard from colonel Whalters yet? - No sir, not yet. - All the patients evacuated? - Will be by morning. - You all set? - Yes sir. - Ok, move out. - Yes sir. Ok, wind them up, wind them up. - Wind them up. - Hit the road, hit the road. 10-minute break. Lieutenant, smoking lamps out. Major. Oh, major... - Oh, major? - Are they going together? No, she's strictly bush league stuff. We were worried about you Jed. I, I mean, you getting trapped on that hill and risking your life. Yeah... Yeah, I'll tell him when I see him. Down, everybody, down. Get down. - Major. - Yeah? Hit the road, move out. - Are you all right? - Yes sir, I think so. Except every time we meet you knock me down. Well, I didn't want you getting a purple heart so soon. No sir, just black and blue. About this morning, I didn't mean to get in the way. - Forget it. - Yes sir. What's a girl like you doing in Korea anyway? - Getting in the war like everybody else. - Everybody else? What do the people back home know about war or us... Or what it like over here? - Not much, I guess. - Less, nothing. Slogging along in the mud and the rain, surrounded by the enemy. Frostbites in the wintertime, mosquito bites in the summertime. No sleep, no peace. No hot meals, no women... - no women... - Wait a minute. I beg your pardon. Oh brother, now I heard everything. Maybe I am a dumb rookie and an eager beaver, ok? Maybe I don't know enough to keep my head down, but I do know a pass when I see one. In Pennsylvania, I'm the best little interceptor of passes you ever saw. - You ever fumble one? - No. - Never a fumble? - Well... - Oh, that's too bad. - Oh boy, I've heard all kinds of lines. From misunderstood husbands to guys who just want to fondle me like a sister. Oh, but your line. They gave me a gun, war is hell. - A little too obvious, eh? - Oh no sir, just sneaky, that's all. All right, drop them. Line them up by me here. Line them up good. Drop it. - Side poles up. - Side poles up. - Center poles up. - Center poles up. Ok, move out. Make sure to hit all those puddles. - Colonel Whalters with you? - Over there. Good morning colonel. You've had yourself a busy time. Nobody in this man's army can get himself in so much trouble as you in so short a time. - Why thank you, comes naturally, you know. - It's not funny. - No sir. - Moving out at night, getting ambushed. That little episode with the chopper, you had no business being there in the first place... - in the second place, you might've shot up. - They say it happens in a war. Colonel, casualties coming in heavy. - Dobbs, get me a cap and gown. - Yes sir. Looks like you did the right thing moving last night. If you were a little more military, you'd be running one of these outfits yourself. I don't want to run anything colonel or anybody at any time. We're going to have company. Thank you. First he'll look around like there's no place to sit. When he gets here, he'll make like it's a big surprise. - Stay here. - Not me. Don't go away, please. Well, good morning. Morning, major. Morning, major. - Well, this is a pleasant surprise. - Yes, it's a small world. - Well... - Me too. Oh, just a minute. Are you handling the Korean refugees? Just the typhoid and typhus inoculations, yes sir. Oh, that's very important, you better not keep them waiting. No sir, you coming Ruth? Finish your coffee lieutenant. Never fumbled, eh? Just too bad. Well, the tank boys captured some vodka and some... canned fish eggs and I thought maybe... if it's quiet around here this evening we'd have a little celebration. You know, I'm planning a wonderful relationship between us. - Why me? - Why not you? I'm not here for that major, I'm pushover for only one thing, winning the war. Yes, yes, of course, of course, but... I thought that maybe while we were winning the war... - No, no, you figured me wrong. - I didn't figure you wrong, you want to bet? All I want to do is be the best nurse I can. Want to bet? That's egg on your face major. Gooks been on the move two days they say. - I'll give them some rice. - Once they get inoculated, keep them moving. And they're not gooks. - Franklin? - Yeap. Help me. This boy is hurt. How did he get wounded? - How does he look? - Not good. Got hit by shrapnel, old papa San said his mother and father got killed. Hasn't got a chance. He would if major Webbe would take him. Sergeant... - Get him X-rayed. - Yes ma'am. - Coffee Dobbs? - No thanks. You know what's holding up our shipment of whole blood? - I don't know sir. - We're running low. Colonel, there's a little Korean boy with a very bad chest wound. Major Webbe will take care of him, I'll call base hospital about the blood. The X-rays will be ready very soon. Now these Korean refugees are getting to be quite a problem. When are you getting around to my problem? The Korean boy. - Ah, this your idea? - I warn against it. Dobbs, set up for chest surgery. - Ok. - Yes sir. - You, inside. - Me? - Me? - Yes, we'll win the war together. Ties. Are you still here? Sit down. - Well sir you see, that Korean kid... - Is he still in surgery? Yes sir. Nurse, the X-rays. This boy never had a chance in the first place. He has now. Sponge. - Closing him. - Major, I can't get a pulse. Retractor. Retractor. Retractor for what? Hold this Dobbs. Nurse, 100% oxygen. Wider. That's better. One-two, one-two, one-two, one-two... Massaging his heart. Ever done this before? No. Adrenaline. I'm getting a pulse now. Good. Start some blood. I know I saw it, but I don't believe it. How is the kid lieutenant? Oh, he'll be all right, but I don't feel so hot. Chaps with the 26th field ambulance... - How about a short one sir? - Jolly good idea. - Evening. - Evening major. - Sure you won't come in? - I'm beat. What are you thinking? - About you. - Good, that's good. At least you're not wasting your time. - Was a beautiful job in surgery today. - Oh, this is a beautiful job I'm looking at. To be able to do what you did, it's kind of wonderful. Is it? The man who made the machine gun got rich. TNT made its inventor a million dollars. But I'll bet you don't know the name of the man who discovered novocain. Einhorn 1905, why? Nothing. Major... You have got to stop creeping up on me. - Would you like to hear the story of my life? - Oh, not now. Well, I worked in a pretzel factory in Pennsylvania... 6 days a week, bending pretzels, did you know that Pennsylvania has very famous... pretzels? What's the matter? - Stay over there, please. - Well, don't you like it? - Yes, that's the trouble I do like it. - Well, relax and enjoy it. - No, I can't. - You're not even trying. Don't be angry major, it's... Well, it's just when I go for anybody, it's got to be all the way. Yes? All the way means one man for all the time, getting married and... Please don't be angry. I am not angry, I am just a complete nervous wreck. You see what you did? No, no, no. I was connected with medical depot. Say our shipment of whole blood will be in sometime tomorrow. Hello. Hello. Hello. This is colonel Whalters, when tomorrow? Oh. Oh, I see. Right. Thanks. I'll have Rusty fly down, pick it up in the morning. No hurry, they don't know when it'll be in. That's all right. I got to check a list of outgoing patients anyway. - Did you hurt yourself? - I, I, I don't know. - What happened to the lights? - Generator went out I guess. - Did you hurt yourself very bad? - Well, I twisted my ankle, nothing serious. - Sorry I barged in on you. - Oh, that's all right, any time. The tent, the tent. The tent... The tent, tent... - The tent... - Excuse me. Whom are we trying to keep from getting wet? - Hey, what are you laughing at? - It's the first time I ever kissed a fish. Well, here's your second. Do that again. What a funny way for it to happen. - What are you doing later? - Waiting for you. Ok. Dobrowski, Lanier, Loeberman, McCoy, Tassman and Zimmer. - You men will leave here in the morning. - All the way to the states doc? Some of you, yes. - You better give him a half unit of blood. - It'll have to be plasma major. - All right. - Why not whole blood? Because papa, there isn't any, we're picking it up tomorrow. Use mine tonight. - You're not exactly the right type. - I'll get volunteers. - Suppose they won't? - When I draft them, they volunteer. - But plasma is just as good as whole blood. - Since when? - Do as he says. - Yes sir. - Coming to the club? - Still waiting? I'll meet you there. - Mind if I take the records? - No, help yourself. - Coming Dobbs? - No lady. Ok. Don't be too disappointed if he doesn't show honey. It won't be the first time he stood up a girl. And you ought to know. Well, what's any of us really know about the major? - He's a man, what else you have to know? - He might even be married. So? Experienced drivers they're always safer. - I'm only trying to help you. - Then put your claws away. When a man doesn't talk about his past, his future is not dependable. Don't listen to her, nothing she gives away is worth anything, especially advice. - Suppose, suppose he is married? - So what? You're not really serious about him, He's just somebody to spend a little time with. Oh dear, that bad, eh? - Your pumpkin is here baby. - Thanks. - Well, where do we go? - We haven't much choice, have we? Well, let's go there together. One thing the army does not provide is privacy. Very short-sighted of them. - Jed? - Yeah? - What's your family like? - Why? Well, I just don't know very much about you. - Oh, you know enough about me. - I don't even know if you like me. You know, something tells me you're about to make woman's fatal mistake, talking too much. - Oh? Do women always make mistakes with you? - Just to change the subject, I... - bought a present. - Don't you like your family? Yeah, it's not bad. Only cost me half a month's pay, the least you can say is thanks. Thanks. - Are there? - What? Any brothers or sisters? Have you ever seen the inside of an ambulance at night? - Jed... - Pitch black at night. Is there a wife, maybe? Well, is there? You know, you're about to wreck something beautiful. - Don't you think I ought to know if there is? - No. Well, I guess that means there is. I'm about to go back in there and have a drink. - Why don't you want to talk about it? - Because I want a drink. - Well, you just had one. - Not like the one I'm going to have. Why is it so wrong for us to talk about ourselves? The way I feel about you, talking is no good. - Are you coming? - Now you're angry and it's my fault. I wanted this to be so good, I'm right for you... really I am and it will last, for always. Nothing is for always. We'd be lucky if we can keep it right and real for even one night. Are you coming or not? - Is the whole blood come yet? - No sir. Ready for transfusion sir. - Nurse. - Yes sir? - Any word from captain Rustford? - No sir. - More sponges nurse. - Yes sir. Is this air base Taegu? Hello air base Taegu. Hello. Rusty is got a headwind all the way back here. - He'll never make it before he runs out... - Well, what do you want me to do? Hello, Air base Taegu. This wind keeps up sir, we're going to lose our key tent. - It's that bad, eh? - Yes sir. Hello, hello... Line up all the trucks. Make a windbreak north of receiving. Yes sir. - Be dark in an hour. - Air base Taegu major. Jed, don't let him take off. Hello, hello Taegu? This is major Webbe, mash 66, mash 66. Got one of our copters down there picking up whole blood. Captain Rustford, Rustford. Let me talk to him, will you? What's that? When? Took off from the air base 20 minutes ago. Major, get him on the radio, make him turn back. You're risking the life of Rusty and the plane for a few bottles of blood. Yeah? What about their lives? All right. Get it through there, take it around. Get it through there, take it around. - Get those bags over here, will you? - Give me a hand here. - Get him on the radio. - And have him do what? Pray? Tell him I'm going down the road in a jeep. When I hear his motor, I'll start flashing my lights. Then I'll start back to camp so he can follow me. When you hear his motor, light the oil pots so he can land. - Yes sir. - Ok. Base 66 to windmill 13951. Base 66 to windmill 13951. Hear him yet? - Let's go. - Spot those corners. - Straight line. - Spot those corners. All right, let's go. I think... - Maybe that's him. - Light them up. Hurry it up boys, light them up. Let's light them up. Hurry it up. Never thought you'd make it. The blood is arrived doctor. We won't need the donors. Never mind now soldier, thank you. You could use a transfusion yourself, plasma, scotch. Thank you. See our headlights? - You bet I did, thanks, thanks a million. - You bet. - More sponges. - We're out. - Out? - Yes. Oh, I see. Well, then get somebody to wash and sterilize the used ones. Yes ma'am. - Are there many more patients waiting? - Quite a few sir. - Get Webbe in here to help us. - He went off duty over an hour ago sir. Get him in here. Well, what is it? - He's been on duty since early this morning. - So's everybody else. - Yes sir. - Just a minute. - Where is he? - I believe he... - Yes? - I'm not sure sir. - I'll find him myself. - Yes sir. - Will you join me in a little drink? - No thanks. And I don't mind if I do. You know... you did a terrible thing, walking out on me last night. - You walked out on me, remember? - Yeah, you shouldn't have done that. - Come on, we're getting out of here. - How about a dance? Why, why don't you let me get you some coffee? What? And spoil this magnificent thing that I worked so hard to get? - Colonel Whalters wants you. - I want you and that's much more important. - You don't understand... - Oh yes, I do. You're trying to save the world or something. Ok, just you and me. We'll save it all by ourselves, all alone, no help from anybody. - Come on, I'm going to sober you up. - Lady, you're in the wrong army. What you need is a tamoubrine, yeah a tam, tambourine. Colonel Whalters needs you at the hospital. - What you say? - Colonel Whalters needs you at the hospital. - Now? - Right now. Oh. I can't go the hospital, not like this. - He'll be ready in a minute sir. - Wait outside please. But, yes sir. - Are you drunk? - Yes sir. - Confine yourself to quarters. - Yes sir. Confine yourself to quarters friend. - Sorry about last night. - You can do one of two things. - You can put in for transfer right now. - Or? Or you can stay here and not touch another drop, not one. If I see you drinking or I hear about it, I'll have you court-martialed, the works. Every casualty is entitled to the best that we can give them. That goes for me, for you, for everybody else. The best, whenever it's necessary, 8 hours a day or 24 hours... Or a whole week without a break, if it's needed. That's the way it's got to be. - Ok papa. - I'm on the level Jed. You'll be finished... in the army and as a civilian doctor if there's one more drunken night. - Ok, ok. - But you were drunk? - Yes sir, I, I was drunk. - You never did it before, why last night? Oh I don't know, maybe the war is catching up with me, its ugliness, stupidity, futility. - It's a job, that's all. - Yeah, but other jobs get done. Did ever occur you colonel, we never catch up to our job? Only once, just once we could get ahead of the game, beat the number of casualties. It's an unusual generation we're living in, three world wars in one lifetime. I don't know, maybe whiskey is as much a part of our life as war. - Yes? - Colonel Whalters? - Yes? - I have a request sir. Right, I'll take care of it. What is it? - Colonel Whalters, I have a request sir. - Well, sit down. No thank you, I'd rather stand sir. I want to be transferred. Now, you know you haven't been here long enough to put in for rotation. - Oh, I don't mean back to the States. - Japan? Oh no, I thought maybe you could transfer me to some other mash outfit. - Suppose you have a reason. - Yes sir. - Personal one. - Corporal, don't you need a cup of coffee? No sir, yes sir. - Personal reason? - Yes sir. - Meaning major Webbe. - Yes sir. - What's he done? - Oh, nothing sir. - It's me, not him. - Oh? - I'm the one that's causing all the trouble. - Oh? - I, I think I've made him terribly unhappy. - Oh? Yes, and I think that I'm the cause of him getting drink, drinking last night. And you think by transferring out that you'll stop all that? Yes sir. Well now, assuming that you're right, which I doubt... that he drank because of you, which he didn't... wouldn't your leaving just make him feel worse? Would you like to help him and yourself and me? Colonel, I just don't want to lose him. Maybe you've been using the wrong tactics. Instead of retreat, maybe you should be advancing. For you. - Do you know the theory of tactics? - Not exactly. - Good. - Why? Good night. - Get in. - Where we going? - Out. - Have I slip into something formal? - Having a little trouble? - Oh, nothing I can't handle. Well now, want go in? And watch somebody else drink? No thanks. Yeah. What do they know about war? Are they freezing to death? No steam heat? No chicken a la king? No men? Ruff, no men. Lieutenant, you got to stop creeping up on me. - Relax and enjoy it. - What's all this suppose to be? War brother, ain't it hell? - Now, where do we go from here? - Well, I think I need a little bit of advice. Oh? Shoot. Well, the first one, I want to apologize. Apologize? What for? You haven't done anything yet. Of course, I mean about the other night. - I didn't mean to ask all those questions. - Oh, you mean asking me if I had a wife. - That isn't important now. - Well, in that case I'll tell you. Yes, I, I had a wife, she had two heads, one of the heads and I just couldn't get along. Yes, I was married, she walked out on me. - Maybe you just didn't try hard. - No, no. Was one of those war marriages and I guess she just got tired of waiting and... went off with another fellow. - I see. - No, you don't. Well, now you're just sore at all marriages. No, just for me. Well, this will be the first time I ever walked back from a jeep ride. - I didn't ask you to marry me. - With you it would never work any other way. You never be able to pull out all the stops. And the way I feel about you? What am I supposed to do about that? Well, you'll find somebody else. Maybe if we were patient, maybe, maybe in a little while it... No baby, there's no future in this business. Lieutenant, everyone is needed at the hospital. - So long. - Come on kids. Come on, we're needed at the hospital. - Major Webbe? - Yes? They need you right away at the hospital sir, you too ma'am. Ok. Hurry it up. Colonel, colonel. They're ready colonel. - Coming in heavy? - Yes sir. All right, take it easy on that man now, get him in there. All right, move them out. Major. Nurse, cap and mask. All right, unload. Come on, get out of there. Hey sarge, I got a load of prisoners here. All right, get your clothes off. - Buddy. - Buddy. Head up here, take a set. Easy, easy, nothing to be scared. Lift him up. Down. That last chest plate, let me have it. Ok. Hey you, wait a minute. You lousy. Stay away from him, he's frightened. Keep them coming. Soldier. Don't be frightened. Nobody is going to hurt you. Nobody is going to hurt you. You'll be all right. Don't be frightened. Oh, mother of Mary. Mary, Mary had a little lamb. Mary had a little lamb. Mary had a little lamb. Please, please don't pull the pin. I wouldn't know what to do if you pull the pin, stay away from the wall. Don't be frightened, nobody is going to hurt you. You'll be all right, don't be frightened. No one is going to, you'll be all right, just... Don't, don't be scared. Please don't be scared, you'll be all right. Nobody is going to hurt you. You all right? Oh I'm fine, yes. Would you take that? Please. - You sure you're all right? - I'm just fine. Line them in. He's stopped breathing. - Any blood pressure? - No sir. - Any pulse? - Nothing. He's dead. Jed, Jed, please wait. Yes? I just wanted to tell you not to blame yourself for that soldier dying. It's not only that boy. It's all of them, too many of them. Isn't funny? I can't stop crying. Here, you... You just sit right there and cry. Take your shoes off. What do I've to take my shoes off for? Doctor's orders, I'll be right back. Yes, doctor. - You got a shot of whiskey? - Eh? For Ruth, exhaustion. Here we are, put your feet in there. - Feel good? - Thank you. - You know... - Here you are. Jed. - Medicinal purposes. - Thank you. - Good night. - Good night. Honey, finish your drink. You know, that episode of yours with the hand grenade... just a little above and beyond the call, wasn't it? Want to know something? - I haven't got a thought in my head. - Congratulations, you're now a veteran. Back home I used to think I knew what the war was all about. And now? Now I'm not so sure. - Everything seems such a waste. - Yeah. Yes, we can only get more of everything except time. Can't send home for more time. - You got a problem? - Can't open my eyes. - Do I look all right in the morning? - Ah, you look fine in the morning. Do you believe in dreams? Only about lush women in black silk stockings. - I had a dream about us. - Why dream baby? We were in our house and you were very, very sick, and I made you well. - And I know how. - I cooked and I baked for you. That's what made me sick. And then when you came home from the office... Oh, I never come home, work all day at the office. Oh, then I'll come and see you and I'll pretend I'm a patient... - and in your private office we'll make love. - I lose more patients that way. You're a funny guy, can't you say you love me? I think it's better to do it than say it. - You don't though, do you? - Why do we have to talk about? Why do we always have to find words for it? - Truth is, there's... - The truth should never be told by lovers. When it is, the affair is over. I'll say it. I've never loved anyone, not like this. Not this way. I'm from division surgeon, take me to colonel Whalters. - Yes sir. - On the double. Yes sir. Alert your outfit, you're moving out. - Right, grab some coffee lieutenant. - No thanks. Division commander is been ordered to pull back to realign the army front. I have to get you away from here or you'll be out in front of our own lines. What about continuity of medical support? We'll provide that by moving mash 66 to this point. Arrangements made to care for the casualties during the move? - Already been done sir. - How do I evacuate my patients? Use the hospital train. Whalters is hit, get to receiving. Easy, take it easy. - How, how it look? - You've still got your foot colonel. - Evacuate the hospital. - Yes sir. Hospital train. - They, they're moving the front lines. - Give me that piece of wood. All right, swing him around. - Get us moving Jed. - Yes sir. - Statt. - Yes sir. - Wheel out the transportation. - Yes sir. Get me a pair of scissors. Franklin... Quarter gram of morphine and 300,000 units of penicillin. We're overloaded. We got to ship our casualties by hospital train. Get captain Dobbs to pick the most critical cases. Yes sir. Captain. Your new location is marked on the map. Oh, get that litter out of there. Put me down. Put me down. - No use of our both being here colonel. - Put me down. Somebody will have to set up the new hospital. Take him out. - Ah, looks like no hospital train. - Yes sir. - Where's the hospital train? - How is the foot? - No train? - No sir. Major. Most of them won't make it on the highway. You want to chance it and wait for the train? - And if the train doesn't come? - Major... Look, jockey a rig onto these tracks here, use the crossing here. Over here major. I think we might be able to get that truck out of here on these wheels. Yeah, it might work. You ever try it? No sir, I tried something like it when I was with Barnum and Bailey in Florida. - All right, go ahead. - Yes sir. Hey, give me a hand down here, come on. On the double. Watch it. Watch it. Take her over. Stand back fellas, get your pieces. - Name. - Edwards. - Name. - Summers, is it look bad lieutenant? Nothing to worry about. You'll be stateside before you know it soldier. Thank you ma'am. I'll never forget what you people have done for me. For all of us, god bless you ma'am. - Use the jeep. - That's the last of the patients. - Plasma? - Packed all we had. - Food and water? - All we can carry. - What outfit is this major? - Mash 66. - When can you clear this area? - In about 5 or 10 minutes sir. There'll be a couple of thousand men coming through here right soon. - What about those tents? - No room for them. - Burn them. - Yes sir. Let's go. Corporal. Check the I.V. On that truck. Yes sir. - Pour gasoline over all the tents. - Yes sir. - All ready sir. - Fire the others. Yes sir. All right, out of there. Take cover, take cover. Move out. Get us moving. I think she'll be all right. Must've been the concussion. Come on that a-boy, get it on up there. All right, lift this tie up. Get that Jack together. - Get me a hunk of line, will you? - Ok sarge. All right. Ok, run that out of there. Let her down easy. Now. Get that out of there, get that Jack out. All right, get that other side tied off over there. Ok sarge. - You'll be all right. - Oh sure. All right, stick that wheel in there. - Yeah, looks all right, think it'll work? - I don't know sir. - Well, give it a try. - Ok, wind her up. Now look, take it real easy, start it real easy. Ok, hold it. Yeah. - Jack, Jack. - Yes sir. Get all the nurses off this convoy, put them on this truck with colonel Whalters. - All of them, on the double. - Yes sir. Hiya Danny. Hello. - Well Jed? - All the nurses are going with you sir. Good, you'll find our new position marked on the map. Get your patients there no later than tonight. Tonight? If I move them too fast I'll bounce them to death. - And if you move them too slowly... - Yeah, the weaker ones won't last overnight. Whatever happens, keep moving, you've one objective now, to save your people. The only way you can do it is by getting to base hospital tonight. - Right. - Good luck. Catch up with you at the new position. Hey, one of you guys speak english? Look, tell him not to be afraid. Tell him he's going to go to the red cross. No more wars, tell him he's going to get good food and go to school. Tell him not to be afraid. - All set? - Is this the end for us? I don't know, how can you outguess a war? What's the good if I get through and you don't? - We'll get through, all of us. - Major, all ready sir. Better hurry, that incoming mail is getting closer. Right. Well, I guess this is goodbye. If only we'd had more time. - We're lucky to had any time. - I know, I just don't want it to end. I'm sorry. - I just always say the wrong thing. - Well, then say the right thing. - I love you. - That's the right thing. I'll get back to you. I'll make it because I want to, understand? I want to get back to you. Ok? Now, let's go. Ok? Ok? All right, move out. - Hi. - Hi you sarge. - How is things going? - Rough. - What's the trouble lieutenant? - Sorry major, you can't get through here. I'm moving a hospital, I got a lot of casualties. Sorry sir, the commies have put some guerrillas through our left flank. We've got them cornered about two miles down the road. You might get through there though. - You sure that trail is open? - I'm not sure of anything major. But it's better than staying here, because in about two minutes... you and your casualties might be up to your necks in fighting. - This way? - That's the way. You all right in there? - Hit the deck. - Hit the deck. Sergeant, tell them to get out of there, but quick. - What's your outfit major? - Mash 66. Let me have that map. Heading for this area here. Well, this trail is closed sir. - More guerrillas? - Right sir. How long will it take you to get them out of here? They're dug in pretty good sir. The terrain is on their side. - How long? - Maybe couple hours, maybe couple of days. There's a road down the hill there sir. About a mile and a half down there. I know we still got that road because our supplies are moving on it. - I wouldn't advise staying here sir. - Thanks. Well, we can't go back, we can't go ahead and we can't stay here. So? First we unload all the patients from the vehicles. Second? We'll move our transportation off this mountain to that road. - Well, we'll try sir. - We do it. Yes sir. And we do it without losing even one vehicle, not one. No reckless drivers, no cowboys, no hot rodders. I want every truck, jeep and ambulance down on that road in one piece and right now. We got to get to base tonight. - And the patients? - Carry them down. Orderly, gently, cradle them down. - All right, move out. - Yes sir. All right soldier, take it easy. All right, next. Hey, you all right? Down there. Ok. Easy, now. If I ever hear the infantry gripe about life in the army. Take a look at that. They haven't invented a medal yet for those people. Mash 66 to division surgeon. Mash 66 to division surgeon. Come in please. Over. Hey... Hey, hey... - Hiya lieutenant. - Hi major.
