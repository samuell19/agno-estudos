Did you hear about the Irish girl who took the pill TWICE a night? To be sure, to be sure. To be... Harry, we'll stir up the indigenous population when we get there, eh? Remember what the man said, Rogers - "You are the Special Air Service." "You are visitors in South Vietnam." Better it's there and not here. What do you mean? That we're visitors. I can see Mum's face if Mrs Wilson next door came in and sprayed the joint with a 7.62 tracer. (Imitates gunfire) (All laugh) Scare your flying ducks, wouldn't it? (All laugh) Ready for the plane in five minutes. Oh, get away! Ready for the plane in five minutes. Does he think a man's deaf? Bloody pogo. (MILITARY MUSIC CONTINUES) Cards? ROGERS: Oh. Take it easy, thanks. Are you returning with this plane or staying with us? There y'are, mate. Excuse me, sir. (Soldiers talk at once) Thanks, Bill. How much? No worries. Don't worry, Dawson your shout next, mate. (All talk at once) This is the way to go to war, eh, Harry? (HELICOPTER WHIRRS OVERHEAD ) What do you reckon, Sergeant Major? Been here a week - when will I use this? Soon enough, soldier. Then you'll wish you hadn't. Just remember, when you do use it - shoot the Charlies, not the villagers. How will we know the difference? Oh, you'll know...when they blow your stupid head off. (Laughs) RADIO: Smack-dab in the centre of your radio dial, this is AFR Vung Tau, the Australian sound in Vietnam. Moron! (Both laugh) (THUNDER RUMBLES) Arggh! Wet. Bloody rain. You could set your watch by it. What did you say, Harry? This rain! You could set your watch by this fucking rain! Not you again. Who were you expecting? Steve McQueen? No such luck. What's this shit? Scrambled eggs. You really excelled yourself this morning, Cookie. Do you know why they call cooks fitters and turners? Why? You fit food into pots and turn it into shit. Up your arse. I'll piss in your scrambled eggs. (All laugh) Hey, take your hat off. You can't eat with your hat on. (All talk at once) (THUNDER RUMBLES) Pay 21. Bust me for 18s. Third time in a row. Wouldn't be trying to cheat your old mates, now, Ronnie? Who, me, mate? Unnecessary.

Sing. Sit. Pay 21. Pay me...$4. How many did you have, Bung? 21, mate. Mmm. Six...seven's 13... ...eight's 21. Yep. Four is 25. (All laugh) Sorry, shithead. Dumb bung, eh, Bung? Shouldn't try and get the Black man, Bung. Funny little games, Bung, eh? Burnin' eight? Uh-huh. Double them? Buy one. Rain's stopped. Sit. Oh, at least we can hear ourselves think now. No, I'm sitting, thanks, mate. Harry, you playing? Shut up. Listen. What? Shut up. ( RADIO PLAYS SOFTLY) ( EXPLOSION ) Mortars. (EXPLOSIONS) (Screams) Jesus. (Retches and gurgles) Medic! It's a fire.

There's a fire out here! (LOUD CLATTERING) Medic! Nothing I can do for him now. Medic, for Christ's sake! I've only got one pair of legs. Lift him up. Who's that? Roberts. Lost his gut. Walked out of his tent and it went off about 2ft from him. Oh, shit, what a mess. Bring a stretcher! Anyone got a smoke? 6th got two dead, one wounded. Roberts is dead. Must have been shock. I was at his wedding six weeks ago. ( EXPLOSION ) Shit, get some medics now! Over here! Hey, over here! Over here! That fire near the ammunition dump - put it out now! Look, we asked for help up here! (MAN COUGHS IN DISTANCE) You sure? How do you know they're dead?! Come on. Come on. Come on. Sorry. Sorry. It's OK, mate. Forget it. One...one caught it full in the face, and the other caught it in the chest. Where's the other one? Over here. Torch here, mate. Dressing, Bill. (Soldier whimpers) What a shit-fight. (Moans) He's OK. His thigh's ripped open, though. Will they cut my leg off? Not unless they're pissed they won't, mate. (Chuckles) (Soldier breathes raggedly) Get him some water! Smoky, organise the chopper. I'll get him ready for the pad. Come on, Bill. We'll get those clothes off and I'll buy you a beer. You can buy me 10. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (Whispers) Morning, Patrol 24. Glad to see you made it. What happened? Get lost or something? No, it was such a lovely day for a hike. I bet the leeches are having a field day. If they bite you, they'll get pissed. Shut up. (Sighs) Four days we've been in this sewer. Haven't seen a bloody thing. I hope something happens before five o'clock - I'm taking a bird to dinner. Hard to get a cab at that time. Well, Bung, I think I'll just go home and watch television. With luck I might crack it for a war movie. Oh, shit, can I come over? Only if you promise not to pick your nose in front of the women. They don't mind getting their gear off or a bit of perversion, but they do draw the line at nose-picking. (All snigger) Well, let's go. (THUNDER RUMBLES) HARRY: You can set your watch by this fucking rain. ( LOW-LEVEL CONVERSATION ) Hey, the gunner's having a blue movie tonight at 10 o'clock. Two bucks and all you can drink.

He's dead. Scott! Yeah. Martin! Sir! ( PLANE ROARS OVERHEAD ) Hey, mine's a bill. Who do you owe money to here? No-one. It's from Australia.

This is Tony Roberts with you with the lunchtime program. We again apologise for the late start to the lunchtime program and also our break this morning. This was due to minor technical difficulties... (Groans) Take a look at this. Jesus. They don't look good, mate. I think you've got leprosy. My feet are OK. It's my crotch that's my problem. We know - you can't leave it alone. I wouldn't worry. Everyone else in Task Force has it. What? Rogers' crotch? (All laugh) Knew he had some poof in him. Hey, up yours. There you are. Told you, deadset queen. (All laugh) Hey. Can something cure me footsies? I'm told it helps if you piss on them. What's it do? Stink kills ya - save yourself worry. I'll go see the M.O.

(All laugh) The Vietcong Provincial Mobile Battalion D445 has been active down in the Long Green. Now, it appears they're being resupplied from the north along trails through the My Tau and then down through Xuyen Moc. Air photo recce south of Xuyen Moc shows two likely staging areas here... Got that? And here. Alright? Lieutenant Golonka with Patrol 31 confirms this as a small staging camp. Now, in outline, your task will be to reinforce him within this extended op zone and recce this larger staging camp. C and D Companies from 6 R.A.R. are 5,000m to the south. Now, 31 wants the RV at this small creek junction. Known LZs are marked on the map here. Here are the grid references. Those southern LZs are probably very swampy now, but if the ones look dodgy closer to your op zone you better check them out. Any questions? Oh, yeah. You're pretty sure there's only VC and no NVA down there? Yeah, pretty sure. There's been no contacts reported for eight days and before that it was all D445, OK? Right. Thanks, mate. Here endeth the lesson. We'll look nice and obvious scouting for the battalion. 70-odd bloody nashos wandering around 5,000m behind us. It's not that bad, mate. It's all the better, really. If we meet a mob from the opposition, at least we'll have some support. Safety in numbers, you know. My arse it's safety in numbers. These bastards don't want to hear about war. Civilians in uniform. It's not their fault. Hey! Have a go at this! It's a beauty. Where'd you get it? I pinched it from the Yanks. They get that close, I'm surrendering. ( LAUGHTER) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (BIRDS CALL) The boss. OK, so, what's the situation? See this creek line here? Yeah. We suspect that there's a staging camp on this rise, about 40 or 50 yards north. About here. VC or NVA? VC. Who cares? They all want to kill ya. Why not call in an air strike? We don't know if it's occupied. We want to know what's in there. We suspect it's a weapons and food cache, maybe some documents. OK, when do you want us to move out? Move in 15 minutes. You lead. Brief your boys. (MACHINE-GUN FIRE) Arggh! (GUNFIRE CONTINUES) Medic! Get Scott! Cover me and don't shoot me in the arse! (GUNFIRE CONTINUES) What's going on?! Scott's been shot. There's a bunker in front of us. Grenade!

Yeah, Jacko's got a nick. And our 64 says "ratshit". Dust-off's on the way. Tell them to hurry it up. Scott's a mess. (Scott continues screaming) How is he? Shithouse. I wish he'd stop screaming. (Scott screams) After today's effort I make it home team 8, visitors 1. Yeah, makes you wonder. How'd it go, fellas? Could've been better. Home sweet bloody home. You alright, mate. Yeah, sure.

Before I joined the army I was a painter. As in pictures. Even had a couple of exhibitions. How come you joined the army? My wife. I left her. Oh, didn't realise. Sorry. So am I, Bill. What happened, Harry? Well, I got married with the idea of settling down and looking after the woman. I said to myself, "Here's one that's different, "here's one I can... really do the right thing by." Then after about 10 months of marriage she starts ringing up saying she's working late, or an old girlfriend's dropped in. Getting into another couple of blokes, was she? It seems she just didn't want to be with me. Shit. Yeah, that's what I thought, Bill. Anyway, one Friday night she rings up - it was our anniversary - and says she's been invited out by some people she works with. Didn't you ask her if you'd been invited, too? Yes, but she said they weren't my sort of people. I wasn't the type that would fit in with them. She came home about three o'clock in the morning... ...rotten drunk... ...collapsed on the couch and went to sleep. What did you do then, Harry? Give her a screw? I packed a suitcase and stood at the end of the couch. I prayed that she'd wake up and say that she was sorry. Anyway, she didn't. So after about an hour, I... ...kissed her on the forehead... ...told her that I loved her, walked out the door. Joined the army the next day. And here I am. I'll be buggered. Yes, I was - well and truly. Well and truly. Who have we got here? Don't we look lovely? Pick up a boxer, did ya? (All laugh) Greetings, O saviours of mankind and the free world. And much respects to you and your charming husband, Your Godship. What can we do for you? (Groans) He's constipated. Oh, shoot him. He's in pain. As you are all no doubt aware... ...we have had occasion from time to time to use one another's equipment. And so, my sons, I was wondering if any of you have come into contact at all with the prick who's pinched my pack. Your what? My pack! Where'd you see it last? The back of me tent. Bung, it may be that we can be of some small service, but, as you know, we are businessmen. What's the catch? I would say it would cost you one dozen cans of the finest ale for we four to get up off our arses and find your pack. Are you sure you know where it is? 90% sure. Alright, it's a deal. Where is it? Cans first. Go, Bungy! Go, mate. Go, man, go. What's the matter? Aren't you back yet? Look at that style! Don't drop 'em! Are they cold? Oh, for fuck's sake. Yeah, they're freezing. Good man. Now, Bung, come with me. Now, you see that big tree up there? Yeah. In that tree is a big bloody orang-outang and we are sure - that is, I'm sure - that not only is your pack up there with him, but every other piece of equipment we've lost over the past week or so is up there with him, too. Well, I'll be buggered. I don't know how we get our gear away from him, because I'm sure I'm not going near him and I don't suppose any bloke's gonna have a bash at him. What are you doing? Why can't we just shoot him? Can't. The 2IC says shooting's out of the question. Why? How in the Jesus would I know? I suppose it's something like the bloke that shot the albatross. Anyway, he said no. N-O. This cost a dozen cans of beer. We did our best, Bung. Here's half a dozen back. Make it five. Make it four. Arggh! Two. (All laugh) Thanks, fellas. Oh, by the way, just in passing, who's going to give me a hand to move? Because Patrol 24's been broken up and I'm replacing Scott. Welcome to Patrol 22 - specialists in arson, murder and drinking. Right! (Laughs) (All laugh) Good on ya, mate. ( LOW-LEVEL CONVERSATION ) What's this mess? Sauerkraut, smart-arse. Be nice, Cookie, or I'll shove your head in it. (Soldiers laugh) No, on second thoughts, it looks bad enough already. ( LAUGHTER) Give him a serve, mate! Hey, where's Bung? The cook finally poisoned him. Yeah. Hey, Cookie! Yeah? This isn't bad. It's almost edible. Get knotted. I should have exactly $2,200 when I get home. If we don't drink it for you. What are you going to do with it when you get home? I might buy a sports car. Hard to screw in. I suppose so, yeah. Well, maybe I'll buy a block of land. Knowing our luck, they'll probably put a road through it and give you four-bob compensation. They can't do that. Too right they can. Has anybody got a cigarette? Do you mean they can take your land even if you served overseas? Look, don't get any ideas that you're anything special just because a few nogs have fired shots in your direction. They can do anything they like to you. You can scream your tits off. It won't do any good. Oh, bullshit, I don't believe that. He's right. They can shoot you and there's nothing you can do. You'd better start to believe that the majority of the wonderful people back home couldn't give two stuffs whether you lived or died. They're sitting on their arses in front of the television right now, and I bet my balls they're more damn interested in 'Coronation Street' than they are in your bloody welfare. Maybe I'll buy the MG instead. Bet the salesman takes it out. Bastards. Fight! It's a blue. Hey, a blue! Hey-hey! There's a blue! Hey, come on, Harry, worth a look! (Soldiers cheer) Shut up about this or you'll get more than a broken nose. I was ordered to spray by the M.O. I don't care WHO told you. Just grab the bloody contraption and piss off now. (Soldiers boo) Hey, what happened? Oh, this medic was spraying the tents and someone inside complained, and the medic told him to piss off, so the bloke thumped him. The rot's set in. What do you mean? I've seen it all before. First they start to argue with one another - a few "piss-offs" and "get stuffeds" and nobody takes any notice. Then comes stage two when all this camaraderie and esprit bullshit just goes. Then comes stage three where they fight and the morale goes. Now, once the morale goes, the sick parades start to get longer and the casualties start to mount up, and all we want to do is get home and get the job over so we don't take risks, 'cause there's no reason to. (PLANE ROARS OVERHEAD) (PLANE ROARS OVERHEAD) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) What do you think? Christ knows what's in there. Could be a pontifical high mass. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) It looks deserted.

Do beg my pardon. Where do we change our money, sir? That's better. You blokes think you can come here and take over the place just 'cause you've done a bit of time in the scrub. Well, you bloody well can't. What's more, you'll behave like soldiers while you're here. You understand? It's no bloody picnic down here, you know. Yes, sir. What unit are you blokes from? Special Air Service, sir. Uh-huh. You blokes think you're supermen. Bloody tin heroes. Oh, get fucked. (Laughs) What?! I said get fucked, you great beer-sodden bag of shit! Right.

Now, what's all this about, Sergeant Major? We had a bit of a disagreement. Do you, er, want to proceed with it? No, let's forget it. Right. In that case, you can tell me where we get our money changed. Harry, where do you propose we change our money now? Buggered if I know. Alright, you lot. Yes, sir. Change your money at the post office. Follow the road past the PX. And try to stay out of trouble. You were bloody lucky this time. Thank you, sir.

Last time he came round, he asked Harry and me why we never came to church. And Harry, instead of saying we weren't interested, said we were making something for the chapel. See, the feathers are connected to the handle. What's it for? You wait until you're feeling randy, then you turn the handle and the feathers do the rest.

Well, we got this here pet scorpion back at our place and we figure our scorpion can beat the shit out of your spider. So? We want to arrange a match - your spider against our scorpion. 50 bucks on the outcome. What about side bets? Jointly controlled. 50-50 on all unclaimed bets. Fair enough. (All agree) As far as refreshments go, we got about 30 dozen cans of Budweiser lined up. We figured seeing as our CO and 2IC are gonna be in Saigon next week, we'd have a combined sports day and barbecue, huh? We'll put the spider-scorpion match as the main event. What about the other pigs? Are they going to Saigon? I'm the only one left. You're an officer? Lieutenant Clifford. Bullshit. It's no bullshit. Well? He's on the level. Right. OK, fellas, see you and your guys about two o'clock next Wednesday afternoon. Don't forget to bring your spider, huh? Oh, we'll be there. Our spider will chew the arse right off your scorpion.

(Groans) I've been sweating alcohol for the last six hours. Jesus, hold on. Oh. Oh, come on. (Laughs) If you don't stop laughing, I'll kill you. Yeah, alright. Oh, you don't look at all well. Could this be the same freedom fighter we saw last night drinking half a bottle of rum on his head? That's what happened? You were the life of the party. Let Gladys Moncrieff sit on your arm. Who? Me spider. Oh, Jesus, no. (Laughs) How'd that happen? Oh, why don't you take a look at yourself? (Laughs) What a brothel. I wish it was. How'd that happen? You and Bung had a disagreement last night. About what? I don't know. We were playing cards, next minute you two were fighting. I can't remember a thing. Never mind. What's a smack in the eye between friends? Did I win? No, mate. OK, fellas, Padre's here! Padre. Come on. On behalf of ourselves and other members of the unit present, um, we would like to offer you this small token of our esteem which comes with our, um... profound gratitude for all the wonderful things you've done to make our stay in this country just a little more, um, enjoyable. Padre. Hip hip! ALL: Hooray! Hip hip! ALL: Hooray! Hip hip! ALL: Hooray! Boys, this is one of the nicest moments of my life. It's not easy being a padre, trying to bring God's word to angry groups of men whose sole business is fighting wars. But I would like you to understand that it's at moments like these that an outsider - and even though I've been in this army for over 15 years, at times I still feel an outsider - feel as though he has a place alongside you. I feel almost guilty. ...I would just like to say it's the most well-constructed wanking machine I've ever seen. Thanks, fellas. Have to go, fellas. God bless you.

Hey, for Christ's sake, what's the trouble? Hey, Bill. Yes, sir? I want a word with you. Look, er, about an hour ago we got a signal that his mother and girlfriend were killed in a road accident early yesterday morning. Oh, Christ. I've been keeping an eye on him, but, look, make sure he doesn't do anything stupid. Do you want us to pack his gear? He says he doesn't want to go home. He wants to stay here. Look after him, eh? Sir. Thanks, Bill. Sir. You OK, mate? Yeah, I'm OK. Bung's not. What's up? I'll tell you later. Help me take him to camp. (Sobs) You right, mate? Grab the other arm. Come on, Bung. Come on, mate. You'll be right. (Yells in Vietnamese) (Wails) Inside, now! (Wails) Get up! She thinks you're going to shoot her. Inside. Inside! (Continues wailing) What's her trouble? That came out shooting. There were three of them. Where are the others? The battalion's got them. Prisoners? Why the performance, then? We think it's her son. Let's go! (Woman continues wailing) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (EERIE MUSIC BUILDS) (CICADAS CHIRRUP SOFTLY) Range? They've got to be kidding. As if there's not enough bangs in your ears. Bloody waste of time. Just another excuse to make a man clean his rifle. Jesus, Bung, I told you you're the worst bloody shot in the unit. Great fuck, but. Not what I've heard. ( LAUGHTER) Watch this, my dears. (All cheer) And another. (All cheer and laugh) Drinks for my friends! (All cheer) Righto, what smart prick did that? Don't know. Must have been a ricochet. I suppose a ricochet did that, too, eh? Fucked if I know, mate. Don't you "mate" me, soldier. You're on a charge. And what charge would that be? Wilful destruction of army property. Oh, that charge. That goes for you three smart bastards, too. What unit are you from? Artillery. Let's have your names. Gray, Green, Brown and Oakover. What? Gray... .. Green.. Brown .. (Laughs) What's so funny, pal? Uh, something I read yesterday, Corporal. OK, Laughing Boy, you can take notice now that I'm gonna throw the book at you four. Yes, Corporal! What's your name? Oakover. Oakover. How do you spell that? O-A-K-O-V-E-R. O...Oakover. Righto. Piss off. Who's Oakover? Is that a real bloke? Yeah. Who is he? Deputy commander of the task force. (All laugh) Who says crime doesn't pay, eh? (Laughs) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Dust-off's on the way. What do you reckon? Shock will kill him before they can operate. No way. I'll be surprised if he DOES make it. His jaw's broken, too. There'll be no more tap dancing for you, mate. (HELICOPTER WHIRRS OVERHEAD ) How bad? Awful. What happened? Mine. What's gone? Both feet, smashed jaw and cheekbone. Albatross 12. This is 22. Are you receiving me? Over. Albatross 12. This is 22. See you later, matey! (Sports commentary on radio) (Sniffs) Don't know why I even bother. Bother to do what? Wash these bloody things. Why? You only wash them to get rid of the stink, and 10 minutes later they smell just as rotten. Sure it's not you? If it's me then you've caught whatever it is, too. You smell like a shithouse in a heatwave. Charming. There's not much we can do about it, mate. I wonder if we'll stink when we leave. Probably. (Sighs) You reckon we're doing any good by being here? Not much. Why not? Because when we get home we'll be an embarrassment to our great nation. The only bastards who'll want to know are the silly buggers. We've got no-one else. Do you mean the attitude would have changed about the war? Yeah, and the fact that we won't win it. We may have held the fort for a while,but the commos will get this place. It just stands to reason. What about the people at home? I suppose it will be like it's been after every war. Well, how's that? A few bods will pat you on the back and say how great you were - that'll last about a week - then nobody will want to hear about it. Why will they treat us like that? Five will get you 10? They'll make a big deal out of it, probably make it an election issue, and you can bet that within five years every one of us wearing a uniform from the Chief of the General Staff downwards will have been sold out by some bloody... ...sticky-fingered politician. Well, what are we doing here, then? You're a soldier, the same as every other silly prick in this never-come-down land. And that's why you're here - because there's no-one else. And everyone's gotta be somewhere... ...and you're here. So get used to it. (HELICOPTER WHIRRS OVERHEAD ) (RADIO PLAYS) I thought you might like to know the wharfies back home are refusing to load our ships. That's nice of them, isn't it? I suppose they reckon they're doing the right thing. Well, it is a democracy. What is? Australia. Yes, if you've got enough money it is. What's money got to do with it? "What's money got...?" OK, stupid, take a look around the unit, or better still, the Task Force. How many silver-spoon types do you see here? None that I know of. Even the officers are pretty poor. Right, and you won't see too many, either. It's the shit shoveller with the arse out of his pants and two bob in his pocket that makes Australia. Every time trouble starts, there he is standing at the recruiting office with his hand out for a rifle while the rich boys are at home hanging on, waiting for a commission or their fathers to get them into a safe job. And while you're stuck overseas with some bastards from the other side, who are just as scared as you are, shooting at you, the rich boys are at home, probably having a bit of a slum and a chop at your bird. Sorry. I didn't mean it. What? Oh, forget it. (CLANGING ) Mess time, you blokes. You gonna eat? May as well. Nothing else to do. You might have something there. We wanna see Lance Corporal Rogers. Bed 14. Thanks, Sister. Thanks a lot. Thanks. Two, four. Where's three? The odd ones are there. How you going, Jock? 10, 12. There he is, 14. G'day. G'day, mate. How are ya? Hey, you're looking great. How you going? Hey, we brought you a couple of little presents, there, mate. Stick them in here. A couple on this side. He's being fed vodka through the nose. (All laugh) With tomato juice. Got a bloody mary up there. (All laugh) OK, mate, don't make him laugh. What is it? What do you want? It's a sheet. It's a St George. What? What is it? You want to write something? He's gonna write something. B-A-L-L... ...balls. He wants to know if his balls are still there. Well, have a look. Come on. You're the skipper. Have a look. I can see one. He's got one. Yep, both there. (All cheer) You'll have to go now, thanks. Oh, that was a bit quick. We don't want him tiring. Sorry. Alright. Fair enough. See you, mate. See you later, mate. (All farewell Rogers) How is he? He's pretty good, considering. They'll make him good as new. Oooh. Good as new, eh? What's a foot or two between mates? 24 inches. Something like that. (HELICOPTERS APPROACH) Jesus. Come and have a look at this. Bung. Bill. What the...? (ROTORS ROAR) (Whistles) Someone's had their arse kicked. Men, ready to move in 15 minutes! Platoon commanders, five minutes. Each platoon ready with 500 rounds. Move it! Come on, soldier. (Shouts orders indistinctly) Get a move on! What's up? North Vietnamese have taken Ba Ria. Shit. That means us. Right, so move! Here we go again. Hope it's over when we arrive. I don't feel like playing this game today. HARRY: Come on, you fearless sons of Anzacs. There's a whole big war out there just waiting for you. What would you like, Bungo? Dozen beers and a turkey sandwich. Maybe rat pie and river water. Oh, make it two Dan Lees 5.56 and two white spots. Get on with it! Don't interrupt me while I'm shopping! Pleasure. Do come again. Thank you. On the slate? Bill to Ho Chi Minh. What would you like? Plane ticket home. Jesus, this is very bloody hairy. You could get your arse blown off easily. (EXPLOSIONS RESOUND) (SILENCE) Looks safe enough. (Clicks tongue) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Arggh! Arggh! Shit! For Christ's sake, Harry, get back. They've got an RPD. You heard what the boss said. Get out! I didn't hear a word he said. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (Man screams) One for Bung! Finish him off. No, let him burn. Clear! Come on, 21, move! Want a smoke? Yeah, why not? Sir. Yeah? Sun Ray, sir. We're ordered back. Trucks are on the way. OK. Acknowledge. Hey. (Mutters softly) Sir. What? Sun Ray's congratulations on taking the bridge. (Sighs) My compliments to Sun Ray. Inform him we're moving back now. Snoopy 22 to Sun Ray. Compliments from the 21. Way to go, Harry. Makes you wonder, doesn't it? A whole morning's work...for nothing. ( 'WHO CARES, ANYWAY?'
