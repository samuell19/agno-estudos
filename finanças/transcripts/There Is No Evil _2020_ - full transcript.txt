There is No Evil - Thank you. - No problem. - Call me if you need help. - Thanks. - Hello. - How are you? How are you? Have a nice day. Thanks, open the trunk. - What's in the sack? - My ration of rice. - Rationed rice? - Yeah. - How much did they give you? - Same as usual. Really? Let me know if it's good. then I'll get mine too. - Ok. - Take care. - Thank you. Mahan, be patience. It will go under and get burned! Wait, please. Wait, ok? - Hello. - Hello. How are you? - Fine, how are you? - Fine. - Sorry... - What Happened? This poor cat is stuck under there and the kids can't get it out. Sorry to have disturbed you. No problem. - Oh, my dear. So tiny. - Sweet thing... Thanks. Thanks a lot. - How are you, little one? - Any time. - Hi, how are you? - Thank you. - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - Thanks. - What's up - Nothing, what about you? - Nothing. Did you bring my shoes? - Here. Thanks. Did you see her? The schoolgirl? Yeah. Fatemeh. She was so sad in class today. Afterwards I asked her what's wrong. She said, "Nothing". I joked around with her a little. And then in the middle of laughing. she burst out crying. - Poor thing! So sad, I pitied her. I said, "What's wrong?" She said, "Lucky your husband picks you up." I asked. "Why? Doesn't anyone pick you up?" She said, "No. My mom's in Istanbul with friends. And my dad's celebrating his wife's birthday." - Think about it! - What do you mean? Unbelievable! I was shocked but I didn't show it. I said, "Oh, how nice. Then you'll have lots of fun today. What are your plans today?" "I have to go to my grandma's place." "Shall we give you a lift?" But she said, "No, thank you." She didn't want to take a cab either. I guess she's going to the movies with her friend. - Friend? - Yeah, boyfriend. How old is she? A girl in her age. during the school term... Instead of thinking about her life. university exams... And her parents officially divorced? I don't know how official it is. But the teachers say he is still with both of them. I don't get the dad at all. The mother is so pretty. - Is the mother also with someone? - I have no idea. Maybe she is in Istanbul with her boyfriend. The stepmother is probably a cruel one too. How would I know, dear? You can't just judge people so easily. Forget it. The topic is annoying me. - Where are we going? - The bank. Yes, your salary. And the wedding gift. - What should we buy? - I don't know. You decide. - How about half a gold coin? - That's too much! Any idea how much that costs? - Let's get a gift voucher or something. - Ok. - Maybe a quarter gold coin. - Ok. Is it too little compared to your co-workers? - No. - Sure? Move, you idiot! Hello, hello! How are you? Thank you. Yes, yes, she is my wife. I'd appreciate it if you could give it to her. I appreciate it, thank you. Goodbye. I won't get your salary anymore. Do it yourself. The teller really gets on my nerves. He called you. didn't he? The jerk probably thought I wouldn't notice. Doesn't he realize you'd tell me? I've been collecting your salary for years. Yet every time he says, "He must come himself" He's just doing his job. So he has to see an ID card. After all these years, he still wants to know if I'm your wife. He always sees that I have your wallet. And I get your ID card and hand it to him. What if we got divorced last week? Don't bullshit me! Do I look like a fraudster? - Did you pay the instalment? - And he is so slow! Did you pay the instalment? I was so angry that I totally forgot. Razieh, it's always the same with you. We still have five days left. You're so absent-minded. Instead of complaining, concentrate on your tasks. The money stays on the account longer, that's fine. We have to come here again in five days. In this traffic and with all the pollution. I'll do it after school. Just pick me up, Ok? It's not about the instalment, just your absent-mindedness. Enough! I'm annoyed enough already. Do you want to turn back? I'm sorry. - Hi sweetie. - Hi, honey. I don't want to talk to you. What's wrong? Why are you so late? Dad, why did you pick her up so late? Sweetie, I had to pick Mom up first. You promised you'd always pick me first. Yes, honey, but sometimes I can't. We had to go to the bank and get my salary. Now we're going to your favorite supermarket. Then go to Granny's. I don't care, you lied and you should be punished. How? By taking me to Bamland for pizza tonight. Ok, sweetie. We'll do that. Why are you promising her pizza? It's fine now and again. We said: No fast food. I want ice cream, Mom! Ok, let's get here first. - Didn't you buy one already? - It's for your mom. Heshmat, it's very dark. There's the wedding tomorrow. My highlights will go to waste. It's perfect for your hair. - No, I don't want it that dark. - Let's make this. No, this one is much prettier, isn't it? No... Number 9. - Are you sure? - Yes. Zahra, where is the ice cream wrapper? Already in the trash can. But we haven't paid for it yet. Shall I fish it out of the trash? Excuse me, she's had an ice cream, but threw away the wrapper. What did it look like? - It was on a stick. - What did it look like? - Heshmat, go and get one. - Come along. Do all of you get the same rations? I don't know but I think so. - Put Mom's groceries separate. - Ok. You do so many night shifts. shouldn't you be different to others? And you don't even ask. Ok. I'll talk to them. Tomorrow? No, I can't come tomorrow. We're going to a wedding. I don't have time tomorrow. What is the problem? You should've delivered the dress three days ago. I was only one day late for the fitting. You should've sent it to me three days ago. No, I'm busy tomorrow. Please get it ready, I'll pick it up today. Yes, thank you. Yes, thank you. Such irresponsible people. They make me mad. She's not like this, but her helpers. They only work under pressure! Darling, that's not for Mom. Go in. Slowly! Granny! Oh, my dearest. Hello, sweetie. - Hello, Mom. - Hello, honey. - Are you well? - Yes, thanks. - Good - Hello, Mom. Take your bag. Get changed. - You took so much trouble. - No problem. - Any news? - Nothing special. - How are your feet? - Thank God, much better. - Has the utility bill come? - Yes, near the TV. - Did the fix the water pipe? - Your plumber was good. Are you taking your pills on time? Of course, Son. Don't worry. - Now your blood pressure. - Where is the TV remote? Here you are, honey. - Zahra! Give it to me. - Mom! - Not "Mom". Give it to me. - Please! Go and do your homework. - Mom! - Not "Mom". Do it! - I don't want to! - Didn't we talk about this? Mom! I don't want to do my homework! - Do you want to eat pizza tonight? - Yes. - Then get started! - No - Math and dictation. - No! - Dad? - Oh, my God! Some creatures make humans sick. Describe one of them. Which one do you want to write about? About parrots. - But they aren't dangerous. - But I like parrots. Answer the question. Heshmat, darling... God bless you, Mom. Thanks, honey. - God bless you. - Don't catch a cold! - I feel lighter. - I've got you. Come. Hold onto the chair. - Take your pills after dinner. - Thank you. - You all should eat too. - We'll eat later. Is it cheese? Yeah, it's delicious. Want to try? The cheese is really good, right? - What's it called? - Feta, I think. It has so many names, nobody knows. Be gentle, Heshmat. Heshmat, have you taken your pills? Are you asleep? Heshmat? Heshmat? She said: "You Can Do It" I'm sorry. Why aren't you asleep? Think you're something special? I'm really sorry. I just can't... I feel really sick. "Sorry, sorry..." Now I can't fall asleep again. It's Ok, nothing's happened! Can't you see he's not feeling well? Then sleep in the shitter but don't wake me! Sorry. Hey, cool it, everyone. What's the matter? Take it, it's your girlfriend. Hello, Tahmineh. Did you talk to him? Did you send him a message? You should've called from an unknown number. Why doesn't he pick up? That jerk! How can I be calm? I can't, Tahmineh. Ok, I can't talk right now. I'll call you later. I can't right now, I'll call you. Here... Why are you dragging that poor girl into this? - Who? - Your girlfriend. What else could I do? An now? What did your brother say? Was he able to do anything? He's isn't answering his phone. Maybe he couldn't do anything, then. He's got many friends and could help. Hey, asshole... What friends? At 2 a.m.? His phone is on silent and he's gone to bed. He's not stuck in some shithole, like us. Are you not human? Don't you understand his situation? What? Is he something special? He's looking for connections to get transferred. What about me? Must I do whatever I am told because I don't have any? Didn't you feel the same the first time? - How? - Don't play dumb, Hasan! We explained everything to him. He doesn't get it. Thinks he's special, the chosen one. Laws are laws. You aren't at your mom's place. This is prison. You're a soldier in Iran. There are rules. Whatever the top dogs say you do. - And if it's wrong? - None of our business. - Whose is it, then? - I don't give a damn. You just obey? I do it because it's the law. I'm a conscript on duty. I live in this country, and the laws says I must serve for 21 months. Being in the military means you shut up and obey everything your superiors say. And it they command you to kill? - I don't want to. - Not this again! Someone committed a crime and was sentenced to death. Not your decision. But I have to execute him. He still doesn't get it. Why are you in the army if you think like that? You should have left the country. Where to, without a passport? What can you do without finishing your service? No completion certificate means no passport. Can you get a driving license? Find employment? Get a trade license? Take out insurance for your family? Not every soldier has to execute people. It's just our bad luck. Be glad that you ended up here. Before I got transferred here. the sergeant wouldn't sign my leave pass unless I wept in front of him. I used to clean 32 toilets a day. Why? Because the guy didn't like my face. This is Iran. There is no law here. Just money and nepotism. They tell you to pull away the stool and you do so. Or it'll be you, and your best friend... pulls away the stool from under your feet. I'm just doing my service. so I can get a passport and start my life. And now I have to execute someone? I don't want to, I can't! You've come here, so you have to pull. It's your duty. You don't have a choice. Or else it's refusal to obey an order. That means court martial, prison, more time to serve. And that's the least of it. Because afterwards it all starts over again. You have to finish your military service. And obey orders, regardless. Or you'll and up like him. Stuck here serving for four years. Listen, you sissy. In one hour you're going to pull away the stool. So why all this palaver? Be a good boy and pull away the stool. Then you'll get three day's leave. And have fun with your girlfriend. Now don't be a goody two shoes and let us sleep! Wait, weren't you bragging about leaving Iran with your girlfriend a few days ago? Promised to take her to Austria so she can study music there. Now this is a part of that. Isn't keeping your promise important to you? Right of wrong, this is the law of the land. It can't be lawless. Find ways to change the law, if you want. But then you'll have to stay in Iran. Become somebody who can change the law. I can't... I swear I can't kill anyone. You can't, but we can? Are we natural born killers? Here, it's your girlfriend. Tahmineh, what happened? Any news? No, no news here. I can't do it. I'm losing my mind! I can't, I swear. I'm scared. I can't, Tahmineh, don't ask that of me. I can't do it. You're at home on your sofa. but giving me advice. I'll call you later. Your phone... We thought of something. It would be better for both of you. Then you won't have to do it. Someone will be executed. but someone else's life will be saved. How? Ali is willing to do it for you. But there's a problem. His sister is really sick. and his family needs 50 million toman. Really, Ali? Can you do it? Well, I've done it a few times already. Once more won't make any difference. - 50 million, tonight? - Yeah, right now. But I don't have 50 million. I've saved 35 for the journey. Give me time till tomorrow. Don't break the deal. 50 right now. How can I transfer 50 million here at night? See, I knew it. He's just a cheat. - That's bullshit. - He's right though. How can he transfer 50 million from here? - What if he breaks his promise tomorrow? - No idea. He hasn't even called anyone! Who shall I call this late? Your girlfriend you keep bragging about. - Brag? - At least pretend to make a call! Let us think you actually tried. I can get you the money, Ali. Give me time. - How can we be sure? - Trust me. What if Ali does this, and your brother gets you transferred. You'd be gone. None of us can reach you after that. Give me a pen and paper, I'll guarantee in writing and sign. Ali has to decide. - Ok, Ali? - Shame on you, bastards. What the hell are you doing? - Salar, his pill! - You're buying your innocence? - Amir! - You can't to shirk your responsibility! - Wait, let me speak. - Don't get worked up. - Just a sedative. - Take it. - Let me finish. - The pill will help. You are a bigger sinner than all of us. You pay, and he's doing it for his sister... Does that clear your conscience? If you don't do it, no one will be execute anymore? Dip both hands deeply in blood. Take some pictures, put them on the wall. So you remember you're no different to us. If not, you might even claim you're the innocent one among us. Mark my words: if you make this deal, I'll be the first to report you tomorrow morning. Whenever it's my turn to pull the stool away. I try to find out what crime he committed. Thank God, none of them were innocent. They were either smugglers or murderers. I said that from the start. They don't hang people without a reason here. They must have done something. Let it go, Pouya. Pray they'll choose retribution or something. then the victim's family does it themselves. You get to keep your clean conscience until next time. Tahmineh. Yes, I'm listening. Maybe it'll help you. Hi... - What is this? - Is it your first time? Go and get the prisoner. Keep walking! What is it? What's the matter? You're a mama's boy, huh? Come, you'll get used to it. Wait here a sec. - Yes - Give me his letter. Wait a second. Here you are. Go ahead. Walk. What is it this time? What's wrong? I have to go to toilet. Go on. Here, handcuff him to the bar. Be quick. Come on. I swear my hands are shaking. Get out of the way, give that to me. - What the hell are you doing? - Shut up! Just go in. You too. - The gun is not a joke! - Shut up! I swear to God I'll shoot you. - What do you want? - Be quiet! - Take off your cap and coat. - This is mutiny! Quick! Put this coat over his face. - They will execute you! - Jacket over his face. - Shut up! - You won't even make it to the gate. Shut up! I don't want to spill any blood. But if I have to, I'll shoot the person forcing me to execute someone. Shut up! Take him in. Take him in. Take his handcuffs. Cuff him to the bar. Quick. Keys! Search his pockets. The keys must be in his pocket. Give them to me. Close the door. Wait. What crime are they executing you for? Cuff yourself, cuff your hands to that. Quick! Not a sound. Ali! Did you take out the trash? - Hi. - Hi. - The ambulance is still not here. - Ambulance? For the execution. Sir, he says he's here about the ambulance. Come in. What are you talking about? The ambulance isn't here. They sent me to ask why. An ambulance for what? You don't know? We have an execution. They sent me to ask. - What division are you from? - Enforcement. - Are you new? - Yes. - Pull the phone down. Drop your gun. - Ok. - Hang up! - Ok. - Stand up! - What do you want? Where's your phone? - Here - I don't have one. Don't bullshit me I swear, I don't have one. - Turn around! - Whatever you want. Turn around and put your hands on the glass! Pull your shirt up. Your shirt! You move, I'll shoot. Drop your gun slowly, I swear I'll shoot! Slowly, drop it! Come here, I swear I'll shoot! Come here, come. Where is it? Where? Where is the key? Give it to him. Turn around! Hands back on the glass! I need handcuffs. Handcuffs! Put the cuffs on him! Hands at the back! - You won't make it to the street. - Shut up! What? Open the cabinet! Open it! - Nothing in here. - Throw everything out! Empty it! Quick! All of it! Take out the shelves. Get into the cabinet. In! Quickly! Face the wall! Get in! Close the cabinet! Take the key and open the door. One wrong move and I'll shoot! Come on, quickly! Come here, come here. Take the handcuff, cuff yourself. - Quick! - Ok... They're going to get you for this. Shut up, idiot! Get into the cabinet. Get in. Get in! In the morning I got up. oh bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao... I knew you could do it, Pouya. I swear... That was really hard, Tahmineh! But I believed in you. I still can't believe I did that. The boss is standing with his cane, oh bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao... the boss is standing with his cane and we work with our backs curved. Oh my God, what a torment. oh bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao... oh my God, what a torment as I call you every morning. And every hour that we pass here oh bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao... and every hour that we pass here we lose our youth. But the day will come when us all oh bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao... but the day will come when us all will work in freedom. But the day will come when us all will work in freedom. When us all will work in freedom. Birthday Mr. Keshavarz, did you bring the frame? - Come up and give it to me. - Sure. Javad. I missed you. Me too, very much. - Thank you. - You're welcome. We weren't expecting you but welcome anyway. Sorry about that. How is the garrison and keeping watch? It's just military service. - It will end. - Yes, it's almost finished. Is Shirin not in? She's gone to town with Aras. They'll be back in a few hours. They've brought many chairs. You're having a big party. Do you need help? Thank you. Your tea is getting cold, drink. I have a ring. With your permission, I want to give it to Nana tonight on her birthday. It's better you talk to her mother. Actually, I spoke with Shirin a few days ago. I want to surprise Nana. I know. Speak to Shirin anyway. Has something happened? Yeah. It has happened. What's happened? These chairs are not for Nana's birthday. We've not been well for two days. Our hearts are bleeding. We've lost someone who... Keyvan was Aras' friend. For Shirin and I, Keyvan was like a son. My condolences. Nana hadn't told me anything. I know, son. Thank you. - Let me look, what are you cutting? - Here. Not the leaves, Ok? And keep the stems a little longer. Oh no, it's falling to pieces more and more. It's nothing, we can fix it ourselves. I don't know why you like this ruin so much. It's not a ruin! It belonged to my granny. It can't be fixed. It's falling apart. Ours was even worse when we moved here. But we fixed it ourselves. It'd take Aras a month to turn it into something great. We are here as well and can help him. I'm saying let's leave. You aren't listening. And I'm saying let's stay. Why don't you listen? Do you know where Bora Bora is? What are these flowers called? - You don't know? - No. Pointless flowers. - Pointless? - Yes. Please give me another one. - Why are you laughing? - Is "pointless" a name? Because they grow pointlessly, bloom pointlessly, spread pointlessly. And they grow all year round. That's why I call them pointless flowers. But it's so strange. As if there's a philosophy in their pointlessness. They're saying: "Happiness doesn't need a reason." How do you know they are happy? Only happiness can make them so beautiful. Really? So you're so beautiful today because you're happy? Ok, finished. Come close, come. You're so glamourous! Your highness, are you willing to be the prince of my dreams? Nana, who is Keyvan? - Was he a criminal? - No. - Then what? - I told you, they were looking for him. - Who was looking for him? - I don't know, the police. - What had he done? - He hadn't done anything. I'm sure the police had a reason. How do you know? The police have better things to do. They were after him, because of his thoughts and beliefs. So he was politically active. Doesn't matter now. He's dead. No, it doesn't matter anymore. I don't like the political people. Politics makes strange bedfellows. You can't trust political people. Why didn't anyone ever tell me about him? Never the right time. And then he was gone already. Didn't we promise to be honest with each other? - To never lie to each other? - Have I lied to you? You didn't tell me the truth. What do you want to know? For years a stranger come to your house. Your father said he was like a son to him. Who was he? Don't I have a right to know? Why didn't anyone tell me about him? So he was family and I a stranger? You're right. I should've explained. Nothing was going between us that could've upset you. I don't want to think about it now. Just let me be happy today. - Was he hiding in here? - He was living here. It's nice here. Listen. I know this sound. It's Keyvan, he is singing. Javad, why are you doing that? Where are you going? Wait! Stop! I'm talking to you! Let me explain. It's not what you think! Nana, come. Stand up, let's go. - I can't, my legs hurts. - What? Get up! I'll carry you across. - I can manage. - Come on. - I love your stubbornness. - Answer me. - So don't you believe me? - No. Idiot! Keyvan was 10 years older than me. Nana, my dad was 12 years older than my mom. You're such an idiot. I love you! Keyvan was my teacher in a way. Not just me, but all the kids here loved him. That blue house was our school. Are you sad that he's dead? How can you laugh when you are this sad? What are they saying? Excuses. They're just giving excuses. They say they don't want a service. Only his family are to be in his funeral. They're even afraid of his dead body. Excuse us, Javad. We've only talked about death today. No, I understand. I hope these bad days pass soon. Yeah. We have to forget about it. We have to past this. Aras, honey... Sorry. Let him grieve. Shirin, it's really cool here. But why did you give up your life and career to move back here? Have they ever asked you to do something that you shouldn't? Yeah. Like military service. From washing the dishes and cleaning the toilets. To marching and keeping watch. It's all forced. Forced labor. Why do you do it? If I don't, my military service becomes longer. You can't do anything before you finish your service. You can't work. earn money or get out of this country. And after all, military service is a law. Who decides the law? I don't know. Anyone who has more power than us. If some of these laws are forced, why can't you say no? I could if I wanted to. But it's just 2 years. I'll endure it. Then it's over. And even if I wanted to I don't have the power. Your power is in saying no. If we say no, they'll destroy our lives. - Hi. - Hi. How are you? Hi, thanks. Nice to see you. - Same here. - I missed you. Go and get changed. the guests will be here any minute. Javad! Javad, are you Ok? - What are you doing here? - It's cold. - I've been looking for you everywhere. - It's cold. Why are you so wet? My clothes are over there. - What? - My things are over there. Your clothes? Why did you come here? What have you done? Come here. Wait. Do you have pants? Do you want to get changed? - Nana, I killed him! - What are you saying? I killed him, I killed Keyvan. I myself pulled the stool from under his feet. They told me he is a criminal. They told me he must be executed. So I killed him. I just wanted three days off. I just wanted to be here for your birthday. Nana... I didn't know him. I didn't know him. I didn't know him. I'm cold. I'm cold. Will you take me home? I'm cold. Put this on. I don't want my family to know any of this. Open your mouth. I told my mom we had a fight. Keyvan is gone. Even though we are sad today because of his absence, we're celebrating Nana's birthday anyway. Happy birthday! All the best on your birthday! All the best on your birthday! All the best on your birthday! May you always smile, may your heart be happy! May you live to be 100 Blow your candles! All the best on your birthday! All the best on your birthday! All the best on your birthday! All the best on your birthday! All the best on your birthday! All the best on your birthday! All the best on your birthday! All the best on your birthday! Dance with me Stand up, stand up! Nana! I counted how many times you got three days off. Just let me be. Nana, don't agonize me. I feel bad about it. I love you so much, do you know that? Your safe embrace... The veins on your hands... Your broad chest... Let's just forget it. I'll miss you. Nana! Nana! Nana! Kiss me Are you Ok? Yes. - She's coming. - Where? The one in the hoodie. Darya... Darya! It was a little weird but the flight was Ok. Yes, the food was Ok too. Dad we talked about me coming here. You don't need to worry. Everything is fine. I'm old enough. Uncle Bahram, my dad. Darya, honey... Hello, Mansour. Hi, I'm fine. How are you? Everything is fine. No need to worry. Ok. Just... I just wanted to say thank you. I'm here at last. Welcome! How was your flight? It was the first time that I was with so many Iranians. It was cool. I was listening to them talking during the flight. It has a certain melody. when they speak Persian, like a poem. Do you read Persian poems? No, but I'd like to start. We'll start reading poems together, then. Are you comfortable in a scarf? Is it Ok? It's kinda cool. Yeah, it can be cool. if you didn't have to wear it all the time. Tell me about uni. You're studying medicine? I just started. I'm not sure if I want to finish it. Then why did you start? I don't know, because of my dad probably. Mansour is a doctor and I think he wanted me to be one too. Sorry, I have to take this call. Hello. - Thanks. - She's talking to Mansour. - Is she alright? - Yeah, she's fine. It's just, she's behaving strangely. You can't get too close to her. What did you expect? Nothing. I just wanted to inform you. She's curious as to why you and Mansour forced her to come here. - Sorry... - No problem. Come, Darya. Come in. - Do you need a hand? - No, no. Goodnight. Goodnight. - Doctor! - Mrs Zaman! - Doctor! Help! My Child! - Doctor, help! - Mrs. Zaman, my child! - Come in, over there. - My child is dying. Over there. What happened? A snake bite. - When did it happen? - Half an hour ago. Did you see the snake? No, just hear the screaming. Take the hat off. Calm down. Where did the snake bite? - The foot. - My child is dying! Don't worry. The doctor's here. Take the socks off. Calm down. - Here. - Where? The snake bit here. It's not that swollen. Take her coat off. Calm down. It'll be fine. It's Ok. Let her relax. How do you live here? Without the Internet or a phone. It's hard moving somewhere else after 20 years. - Are you actually a doctor? - Why? Do the villagers just call you that, or are you a real doctor. Well yeah, I'm a doctor. - So you studied for it? - Yes, of course, I did. I studied at the same university as Mansour. - Echt? - Echt? That means "really"? Yeah, really. I didn't know you studied together. Why don't you have a clinic? It's a long story. I'm going to be here for a few days. I'd like to hear the story. I'll tell you when the right time comes. This reminds me of my dad. Whenever he doesn't want to tell me something, he says, "Another time." Driving here is very strange. Want to have a go? Here No. Why not? I can't drive a stick and the roads look dangerous. But you don't really like driving. I do. It calms me down. - Really? - Yeah. Strange! Because yesterday Zaman drove the whole way. Well. I don't have a driving license. Really? You have to open a hive door very gently. Because any sudden movement will provoke the bees into attacking you. Look. The queen lays eggs here. Can you see the honey? We don't bother them in the winter. We just let them be. Only the temperature in the hive matters. And food for the bees. That's propolis. The bee does that. Bees do it to keep the hive warm. and to disinfect. We put their food in this frame. Something like honey or sweet flour. The bees come and eat it. In the middle of the winter. the queen will lay eggs again. Put it down gently. Come in. Come in. - Hi doctor. Welcome. - Hi, Taghi. How are you? - How are you? - Fine, thank you. What brings you here? Could you spare me a moment of your time? I have time. Please, come in. Nice to see you, doctor. He must've had his reasons. That's what makes it so interesting. You studied so long to become a doctor and then go and live in the desert with bees. This isn't a desert. Whatever. Why won't you tell me? It's not that easy. You could've said, "After university, I didn't like medicine that much." Why is this so important to you? I'm scared. that what I'm doing is not what I want. So far I've only done what I wanted. Always? Not always but most of the time. So, you are a happy man. Happy! Content! I think "calm" would be a better word. Yeah, I'm calm. - What about you? - Me? I'm calm too. How did you two meet? Well, it was 10 years ago. The doctor was sick and came to our pharmacy. But he didn't have a prescription. And I needed to see a prescription. He got angry, yelling. "I'm a doctor. I'm a taking prescription." What prescription? A talking prescription, one that can talk. - And you gave him the medicine? - No, she didn't. No. I didn't. But oh well, it happened. The more I think about it, the more I realize I can't. It's not possible at all. Let's leave it for another time, Bahram? Will there be another time? Uncle Bahram! My dad wants to talk to you. Thanks. Hello, Mansour. Yeah, I'm still breathing. No, I'm waiting for the right time. My dad said you have a lot of poultry and cows here. I thought it was a proper farm. Mansour says funny things. He's 5000 km away, telling you tales. Telling tales of a place he's never been. No cows, but we used to have chickens. Where are they now? There is a fox here who used to come for them every night. No matter what we did, he didn't let them be. So, we gave up keeping poultry. You guys need a dog, then. That way the fox won't dare coming near them. - We used to have a dog too. - You did? Yeah, one snowy night wolves ate it. Oh no! Then you need a fence around here. Kiss me. Kiss me. For the last time... - Did you get a good rest? - Yeah. Wow, what a feast! Goodbye. May God protect you. I'm going towards my destiny. Our spring has passed. the past is the past and I'm going towards my destiny. In the middle of storm, allied with the boatmen. Not afraid to die, I have to pass the storm. At midnight I promised my sweetheart to be faithful. that I'd light a fire in the mountains. I travel through the dark night. I walk unknown paths. Zaman! Bahram, spit it out! Don't let the blood back into your lungs. Are you done? Ok, come. Come. Let me wash your mouth. Take this off. Are you Ok? You'll sleep for several hours. When you wake up, you'll feel better. Yeah, there's everything: boars, bears... - Bears? - Bahram, don't tease her. Maybe not bears but there are wolves. Come this way. You should come here in the spring. - It is green everywhere. - Yeah. Don't laugh. But I feel like I've been here in the spring before. Do you see that up there? It's 1200 years old. Maybe you've been there. I forgot to bring the food. - We don't need any food. - I'll get it. - Don't go. - I'll be right back. Come. Have you ever shot a gun? No, but I think it's cool. Yeah, it's cool. You're probably a good shot, right? If you want, I can teach you. - Do you really know its face? - Yeah. How? We looked each other in the eye a few times. - Really? - Yeah. When it came for the poultry. I even spoke to it. I said, "Don't do this." But it wouldn't listen. Came at night, took the chickens and was gone. - Poor thing wanted some food. - At our farm? How could the poor fox know? What about the lives of my poor chickens? A wild animal hunts instinctively. You want to kill it with a gun. I'm just protecting my farm. The strongest will survive. I have a suggestion. You shoot it. I don't know how to shoot. It isn't hard. I'll teach you. I don't want to. I won't kill a living being. But sometimes you have to. I don't have to. Let's assume I force you to. You can't force me. Do you think forcing you would be hard? Darya. Darya! Stop! Darya, wait. What? Zaman? I had to tell her everything. Can I talk to her? No, she's not doing well at all. What is the point of this? I had to tell her the truth. Myself. Before I die. What use is the truth if it ruins someone's life? Will her life be ruined? Won't it? It's her right to know the truth. Your pills. She wants to talk to her father. Zaman, I'm her father. I'll get her and she can phone Mansour. Go to the other room. I'll come with you. I'll talk to her in the car. Bahram, she doesn't want to talk to you. She doesn't want to see you. Why don't you understand her? It's like her world has collapsed. She has a lot of questions. How do you dare tell me you're my father 20 years later? When you're just about to die. How can you be so selfish? My whole life I lived a lie because of you. We can't understand what you're saying. It's hard to live like this for 20 years. And it'll be easy for me now? I wanted you here so I can tell you everything. I don't want to get mixed up with your story. Maybe you think you're my father. But you aren't. You're just my biological father. My father is the person who raised me. I talked to Mansour. He apologized to me for this 20-year-old lie of yours. Maybe I can forgive him someday. but I will never forgive you. I want to go home as soon as possible. I want to live with what I have. But you must listen to him. He's waited years to talk to you. Try to understand him. I understand that he didn't care about his family. He didn't want to kill one person. But killed two instead. He forced my mother's brother to pretend to be my father for so many years. And he didn't care about his child. Right? I did care. That's why I wanted to take you. "I wanted, I wanted!" You wanted everything. Even my mother's death. Your mother died on the way to you. An accident. Who sent her to Europe with smugglers? Your mother and I both decided that. Because we wanted her to be with you. Would you be happier if your father had executed the man back then? Family is more important than being a hero. I just didn't want to kill anyone. Why didn't you kill that fox? Did you want to be a hero? I didn't harm anyone by not shooting the fox. Your mother and Mansour were happy about my decision. Darya, your mother was proud. that I gave up my whole life to avoid committing such an act. Do you know why? Because they had executed two of her brothers. She always asked me: "What kind of animal could execute someone?" But what about me? Did anyone ask my opinion? Honestly, we didn't know that we we're expecting you. And if you had? Would you have decided differently? If I were to go back to my service days and had to execute someone again, I would again pull my weapon on the guard and flee. Here. There is No Evil
