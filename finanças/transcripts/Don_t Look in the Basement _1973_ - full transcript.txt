SERGEANT JAFFEE: Now, look here, I just heard them, Sam. It's got to be them, Sam. It's almost 1930 hours. They would have left an hour ago. I think that's them. Hear them, Sam? Real low. Watch. Above those. trees. They're really coming, sergeant. You wait. They do this every night. Sam, what's that? Right through there. SAM: I don't like it when you say they're coming, sergeant. It scares me! - It's all right, Sam. It's all right, now. - Should I tell him, Jane? - Yes and you both come away from the window. It's been longer than 10 minutes. - Sergeant Jaffee, Jane says it's all right. Come on. It's all right. Jane, if they do come will I see them? - No one has ever seen them, Sam. Now let's not be late for supper again, shall we? - (SINGING) Baby. Baby. - Supper's in a few minutes, Harriet. You'll have to leave your baby here. You know the rules in the dining room. Later you can come back to her when you finish. - Don't touch my baby. Don't you ever touch my baby again. - All right, Harriet. I won't touch your baby. - You better not or you know what will happen to you. I'll kill you. I swear to God, I'll kill you. [IMITATING BOAT ENGINE] - Ready to eat, Sam? - Well, every night Dr. Stephens makes me eat the soup. I bet you don't know how many kinds of soup I've eaten. Come on, guess. (LAUGHING) I don't know, Sam. - Oh Jane, when can we put my boat in the water? - Sam, there's something I've got to tell you. We've been friends for a long time now, but I'm going to have to leave now. I'm going to have to say goodbye. - Goodbye? That means you're going to leave me, Jane. We can't play with the boat? - I'm sorry. Oh I'll miss you, Sam. But I just can't take this any longer. Oh I know you don't understand. When you're ready come eat your supper. I'll be in to join you later on. Right now, I have to go and talk to Dr. Stephens. - Hey Jennifer. Jennifer. Janey's going away. Would you help me put my boat in the water? I bet Janey didn't say goodbye to you neither. I betcha. [BLOWS RASPBERRY] - (SOFT TONE) Baby. Baby. - Aw. [LOUD LAUGHING] I'm going to tell on you. Leave me along! (ANGRILY) Don't touch my baby! I'll kill you if you-- Get away from my baby! I'll kill you! [CRYING] Janey! Get out of my way! My baby! He's taken my baby! DR. STEPHENS: Now use the axe, Judge. Listen to me, Judge. Use the axe, Judge! Go ahead, Judge. Use the axe! Use it. Again, Judge. Once more, again. Strike out. Harder, Judge. Now again. That's it, Judge. Hit it again and again! Strike it! - Dr. Stephens, I must speak to you. - Yes, what is it, Janey? He's doing very well. Can you sense how each stroke reaches down freeing some part of his conflict. Perhaps that's the solitude of the unconscious brain that he's reaching. Reach for it, Judge. - Dr. Stephens! - Yes. Doctor, I've come to a decision about all this. I just-- I just can't take it any longer. Harriet threatened me again tonight. I'm leaving. And said you had someone else coming out tonight? Someone to help? - I can't accept that decision Janey. You're a professional. I won't allow you to do it. [SCREAMING] - Put it down, Judge. [SCREAMING] Put it down, Judge. Put it down! [SCREAMING] - Judge! Judge! Put it down, Judge. Put it down! That's right. Oh god. How'd this happen? - (CRYING) I don't know. - Get out of here! Judge. Judge, I'm not going to do anything foolish. Get the axe, Sam. Very quietly, we're going to walk into the house. Come on, Judge. Don't look at Dr. Stephens. I'm going to help you. Come on, quietly. Quietly. Calmly. That's right, into the house. I'm coming with you. That's right, Judge. Sam, put the axe down on the ground. Sam. Sam, listen to me. From now on, I'm going to take care of the family. I'm going to take care of Cameron, and Janey and all the others. Do you understand? - But Janey's leaving. - Oh. All right, listen to me. I'll be back in a few minutes to tell you what to do with Dr. Stevens. Do you understand me? I'm coming, Judge. That's right, quietly. Calmly. - Don't cry, baby. Don't cry. I'll get your bottle. Here's your-- Danny! My baby! Danny! Danny! My Baby! Danny! My baby! What have you done with my baby! Danny! - Harriet, what's wrong? - Thank you. - Harriet, what's wrong? - What have you done to my baby, Jane? - Nothing. - You took my baby. - No! - You took my child! [KNOCK ON DOOR] - Hello. [KNOCK ON DOOR Hello. Dr. Stephens. - The lady. DR. MASTERS: Go to your room now, Sam. Have you been standing there long? - Why no. In fact, I just this minute came in. I didn't see anyone. - I'm Dr. Masters. It's Geraldine Masters. Am I expecting you? - Well, perhaps Dr. Stephens hasn't mentioned my coming. I'm sorry. I'm Charlotte Beale, RN, psychiatric therapy. - Beale? - Yes, I'm to get settled in tonight. I'm starting with Dr. Stephens first thing in the morning. - Well, perhaps you'd better go into my office. This way. Have a seat. Now, would you mind telling me again just who you are and exactly what you're doing here? - Dr. Masters, I'm sorry you haven't been informed about my coming. You see, Dr. Stephens hired me, oh about a week ago, I think. Yes, on the 20th. I heard about Dr. Stephens unusual psychiatric methods and called for an interview. He liked my training and background and said he was terribly short on qualified help and asked if I would start this next week, which is today. - Now, now, just wait a minute Ms. Beale. First of all, I was not informed about your coming here. And secondly, I feel sure that Dr. Stephens would have brought this up with me if he'd reached a decision about you. - Dr. Masters, certainly there can't be a mistake or perhaps it's just an oversight and-- - That's just the point Ms. Beale. Dr. Stephens would not have made an oversight, not about something as important as him increasing our staff, not when there just three of us. Well, normally three of us on the staff. - You know, perhaps I really should go in and see the doctor. He's expecting me. - Ms. Beale. I have something very unpleasant to tell you. We've had a tragedy here. We've lost Dr. Stephens. He was viciously attacked by one of the patients and he died shortly afterwards. So you could see that this is just not the time to discuss any of this. Well surely, you can understand how his death has greatly changed things and naturally I've taken over in his place. But since I wasn't informed about your coming here, I feel no need to keep any minor commitment that he may have made. Well, certainly not now. You see, I'm uh, I'm changing some administrating objectives and uh what Dr. Stephens had in mind, may not be exactly what I'm planning, well not now. - I just can't believe Dr. Stephens is dead. - We have to accept that, Ms. Beale. I just don't believe you could be of any help right now. - Dr. Masters, I gave up a perfectly good job to come here. They wanted me to stay but I left. - What place are you talking about? - Green Park General Hospital. I'm a supervisor of a psychiatric ward. - I'm not questioning your qualifications. Did Dr. Stephens talk with your supervisor about your leaving? - Oh I'm sure he did, besides I showed them this letter of acceptance from Dr. Stephens. - Then they knew about your coming here then? - Why yes. - Do you uh, have any place to go in the hemisphere? - Well, frankly no. Unless of course, Green Park would consider taking me back. I suppose I could tell them what's happened here. About Dr. Stephens. And about you're taking over. Perhaps, they would make some sort of consideration-- - Ms. Beale. Frankly, I have a very difficult decision. There have been some abnormal reactions with a few of the patients. Dr. Stephens trusted them. He treated them as if he were their father. So realistically, this has been a death in the family. Now my job is to recreate that trust. I doubt there is that Green Park would take you back. It'd be very awkward trying to explain all of this. So uh, well since you're here and Dr. Stephens did make the commitment, I guess you might as well start in the morning. - Thank you, Dr. Masters. - And you must understand that I'm not offering you anything of a permanent nature. It takes a very special attitude to work here. - Dr. Stephens told me that. - Dr. Stephens believed that Insanity was not a breaking away from reality but rather a very complex series of obsessions. psychiatrists have always tried to reverse that and bring a patient back to normalcy, but Dr. Stephens believed the opposite. He believed that these obsessions could be pushed, forced to grow so large so ominous that the patient would have to use his own strength to destroy them. - Really? That's a very interesting theory. - We have been very simply here Ms. Beale, our patients are all people who are unloved, unwanted, forgotten. So we're a family, their family and everyone helps with the chores. Well now, I'll show you to your room. I'm afraid there's no connecting bath. - I'll take it. - Thank you. - Well, this is it. I hope you'll be comfortable. I have a lot of things to do now, so if you'll come into my office in the morning we can go over your routine. - Thank you, Dr. Masters. - Goodnight. - Oh, Dr. Masters. Where are the patient's rooms? - Well they're right next to yours and upstairs. As I said before, we're a family and it's for that reason they're no locks on any of the doors. Dr. Stephens didn't believe in the doctor, patient relationship. Goodnight. - Goodnight. [MANIACAL LAUGHING] [LOUDER MANIACAL LAUGHING] [GASPING] - Good evening, deary. You never should go rushing around like this alone. (WHISPERING) Get out. Get out. And never, never come back, never. - Get out? Why, get out? There's no reason. - Oh, there's plenty reasons. - My name is Charlotte. What's yours? - Up the airy mountain. Down the rushing glen. You never can go hunting for fear of little men. [LOW MANIACAL LAUGHTER] - Good morning, Harriet. These are just a few of our little family. You'll have an opportunity to meet them all later. Danny, behave! (SOFTER TONE) Behave. - Oh it's true. Dr. Stephens tells me what he wants. HARRIET: (SYMPATHETIC TONE) Sam. - He's very sad this morning. HARRIET: Why is he sad, Sam? - Because. Everything's changed now. Like that Ms. Charlotte. And there's some others. - My baby's very sleepy. Very sleepy. Charlotte's name is Ms. Beale. That's what you're supposed to call her. - Dr. Stephens calls her Ms. Charlotte. He's very worried this morning. Oh hush up, Sam. Leave us alone. - Sam. - Janey didn't say goodbye to you. She wasn't your friend. - Sam. It's time. Are you ready? - Oh shoot, sergeant. Do I have to? Oh, all right. - Prisoners inside. Guard that door carefully. - All right, sergeant. Where do you want me to stand? Right here? - That's right. And you'll not leave it. Oh sergeant. Are you coming back? - That's Danny. [OMINOUS MUSIC] Yes? - The guard is posted, sir. - Jennifer? - Yes. The prisoner is secure, sir. - Thank you, sergeant. - That was Sam's friend, Jaffee. - Yes, we call him Sergeant. Difficult case. War. He was or is a real sergeant. His uh, platoon was lost in combat because of something he did. His prisoner, as he calls her, is Jennifer Downey. I want you to, uh watch her very carefully. Spend some time with her. Several times she has attempted to escape. - Escape? - In the sergeant's jargon, to uh break confinement. Sam, I told you not to interrupt me when I'm busy. But Dee, what you want me to do with-- - Now Sam, I'll talk to you about it later. Go on. - And that's Sam. - Sam. Sam is a lovable child. He's been a patient of Dr. Stephens for several years. Dr. Stephens operated on him three, no four years ago. Dr. Stephens allowed me to assist him in that operation. Drilling through the frontal lobe left Sam harmless, but with the mentality of an eight year old. That was the last lobotomy Dr. Stephens ever did. And it was because of that operation that Dr. Stephens turned from surgery to his obsession development theory. - Tell me about Allyson King, - Allison. Now let's see. Allyson has had a very unfortunate past. She was very close to her father and died when she was 13. Then her mother remarried a man that Allyson absolutely cherished and he left. And that was the beginning of the pattern. Allyson tried to love other men. They were cruel to her and they left her and she almost gave up. - It's a classic pattern, isn't it? - Then Allyson met a man thought he was perfect. He loved her and they lived together. But he used her. He sold her to other men. Well, her love for him smoothed that over, but then someone came along who was younger and prettier and he threw her out and that was the breaking point. - What is her attitude now? - She craves love desperately, from anyone, everyone. - And these others, Harriet and Mr. Cameron. - Judge Cameron. - My name is Oliver W. Cameron. Jurists council. Judicator of the Court of Appeals. Doctor of jurisprudence. What are you doing in my room? - Well I really dig all that mumbo jumbo. You know it teaches quality. - I said order. - Strawberries. Do you like strawberries? - Ripe strawberries are the color of blood. - Taste me. Please. Taste me. I can be anything you want. - To be carnal in minded is death. - Come on. I do taste like strawberries. Taste me! - Shroud your nakedness! You're obscene! [SPEAKING INCOHERENTLY] - You freak. You don't want to be touched because you are too damned big! You phony freak. You're trembling look at ya. You're hot for it but you can't reach out. You can't reach out. You can't love. You can't make it. (HIGH PITCHED SCREAMING) But I can. - Rejection can be a very painful experience. - Well, I'll tell you about the others later, but right now I'd like you to start with Mrs. Callingham. - Oh yes, Mrs. Callingham is the one who occasionally hallucinates. - Oh yes, she has a number of interesting worlds. Why don't you take her for a walk. She likes the flowers. She sometimes think they're her children. - It's pleasant here, don't you think Mrs. Callingham? Do you get out often? - It's you who needs to get out. - Yes I remember. You were going to tell me why. - Oh uh. Up the airy mountain. Down the rushing glen. We cannot go a hunting because of the little men. Oh Bobby. Ellen. Lester. - Operator. Operator. Oh, Sam. I didn't hear you come in. - Dr. Stephens. He don't call on the phone anymore. - Sam, I know how much Doctor Stephens liked you. - Dr. Stephens wants us happy. He said I should tell you. - Sam, I understand. Dr. Stephens is still very real for you. - Oh Ms. Charlotte, I forget what the doctor told me to tell you. I knew it a minute ago. - Oh it's all right. I understand. [KNOCK ON DOOR] DR. MASTERS: Come in. - Sorry to bother you when you're busy. - Oh that's all right. Have a chair. - It's about my phone. - Well, patients seem to be accepting you. That's important. I suppose you'd notice that it 's the little things that count most, with especially Danny and of course Sam. - You're very fond of Sam, aren't you? - Yes, very. Dr. Stephens was very close to him too. Sam's lost his intelligence, but he has very deep feelings. Perhaps deeper than ours. - Oh Dr. Masters. - Don't be alarmed. This is Jennifer. Occasionally, she becomes very withdrawn and naturally I'd like her to be with me when that happens. - Is she beyond help? - Beyond help? To say that means we have given up and we never give up. No one is beyond that's why we're always getting closer. - Yes, of course. Please don't misunderstand. - No, no I understand. Well, it's time to be getting into bed. I promised her that I would read to her. Would you mind seeing to the others? - No, of course not. Dr. Masters, I hope you'll forgive my statement about Jennifer. I simply meant that I-- - It's just that you're not quite used to all of our little family yet, Ms. Beale. One day you'll be as close to them as brothers and sisters. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Dr. Masters. Before I forget. I wanted to tell you that my phone is not working. I was wondering if you were having the same trouble. - No. That occasionally happens. I'll try to take care of it. - Goodnight. HUMMING LULLABY] - Goodnight Harriet. - She's asleep. - And it's time you should be asleep too. Goodnight. That's enough for tonight, Mrs. Callingham. - You liked that walk in the garden, didn't you? - I did. - Well don't be surprised if we never go again. - Don't mind my observing. You handle Mrs. Callingham very well. Better than some of the others. - Good morning, Jennifer. Mrs. Callingham. [LOW CRYING] - Mrs. Callingham. Your tongue has been cut out! DR. MASTERS: Take it easy. Here, drink this. - No. - Look you've got to understand that ours is a family of persons who know very few limits. Even the limits of physical pain. When Mrs. Callingham did this to herself she was probably beyond the threshold of physical feeling. My greatest concern about her is the blood that she's lost. She's very weak. - I don't hold up very well, do I? I'm sorry. It's just the thought of our all being asleep. - She was probably hallucinating. Self infliction of pain, self disfigurement, sometimes that indicates that the patient has transcended the body. - Oh, what would Dr. Stephens have done in a case such as this? - Exactly as I'm doing. Calling as little attention to it as possible. Now she's received treatment. Now she has to accept what she's done. For the time being, I wouldn't discuss this with any of the others. - Dr. Masters. Aren't you ever afraid? - I'm always afraid. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] - Hello. Anybody here? Hello. Well hello there. Hello there. [INCOHERENT SPEECH] Oh hello there. Uh how are you? - I don't believe we've been properly introduced. - Uh well I'm the uh telephone man. My name is Ray. [INCOHERENT SPEECH] Well, lady I hope that isn't catching. So you've got some trouble with your telephone? Uh could you show me where the equipment is? - What trouble are you talking about, sir? - Well, I don't know yet. It's something with your voltage drop. Oh never mind I will find it myself. Say, how come you people didn't call? I mean about the telephone. It can't be working. - My name is Oliver W. Cameron. Jurists council. Judicator of the Court of Appeals. Doctor of jurisprudence. - Well that's got to be some big problem. [INCOHERENT SPEECH] What's the matter with her? Cat got her tongue? - I warn you. Heed the lady's advice. - What did she say? [INCOHERENT SPEECH] - She said, You're being here represents grave danger. [INCOHERENT SPEECH] - Poor lady, I'm sorry. I mean I didn't know. She ain't got no tongue. - Objection overruled! - That is immaterial. Irrelevant and Out of order - Oh they let you people just wander around down here, huh? Hey buddy, how about you give me back my screwdriver, huh? - I'll conduct you to my chambers. - No, no, no that, that's quite all right. Look, here's what we will do. You people just wait right here. OK? Then I'll go and find the equipment, all right? And if I'm not back in 3 minutes, then you people can go and hide. OK? That's an awful virus you got there, lady. - Who are you and exactly how did you enter this building? - Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. First, which way are you? I mean this way or that way? - I don't know what you're talking about. I want to answer my question. - I'm sorry doctor, it's just that you got so many twilight people around here, you know and-- - Exactly what are you intending to do here? - It's your phone. I mean we've been getting some strange readings on your voltage lately and well I just came out to check it as quickly as I could and get the hell out of here. - Why didn't you inform me of your coming here? - How can I inform you? You ain't got no telephone. You've got bouncers on every door and a receptionist that ain't got no tongue. What's there to inform? - That's enough of your impertinence. You have absolutely no right to enter this building without my permission. - So what am I going to do? I'm supposed to fix the telephone. You want me to fix the phone You don't want me to fix the phone. It don't matter to me. I'm just the phone man. Now I drove for an hour to get out here. You tell me. All right, this way. - Tell you what, I'll finish this up as quick as I can, then I won't be bothering you again, ever. - The wiring is in this closet. Please don't leave the area. I'll be back in a few minutes to escort you out of the building and under no circumstances are you to have anything more to do with any of the patients. Now is that understood? - Whatever you say, doc. I'm just trying to help. You know what I mean? Hi. I'm uh fixing the telephone. - That shouldn't take too long, huh? - Na. One of the lines was cut. It'll just take a minute. You uh, do understand me, don't you? - You know I used to live this place where the phone man was always coming around. - Oh yeah? That bad, huh? - That good. - I thought you meant that, that y'all had a lot of phone trouble. - Hell, I didn't even have a phone. Who let you in anyway, honey? - Uh I don't know her name. The doctor, I guess. - She let you in? - Yes, sort of. She is the boss, isn't she? - You know, um you know you're kind of handsome. What's your name? Now look honey, I'm just a telephone man. - Don't be afraid. - Look sweetheart, uh you're a good looking gal and all that but this ain't my bag. Not in the closet, it ain't, Now cut it out. I ain't even supposed to be talking to you or nothing. [UNZIPS ZIPPER] - Don't back away from me. You love me. You do love me. Say it. - All right already, I love you. Now cut it out, huh? - Oh. You love me. You do love me. Oh I'm a princess. I'm a princess to men that can't turn away from me. They grasp me and kiss my breasts. Don't push me away! You said you love me! You said that you love me! - Now cut it out! - Love is pure. Love is grace. Love is strength. You'll love me. Your love is pure. You'll always love me. [ALLYSON MOANING] TELEPHONE MAN: Now look what you've done. SAM: (SINGING) I have got a secret. I have got a secret. And I ain't gonna tell nobody but Ms. Charlotte. - You're doing fine now Mrs. Callingham, but you need to rest. You've been up and around too much. - (ANGRILY) Give me that watch, Danny. - You hurt me. - I'm sorry, Danny. I'm sorry. You shouldn't have scared me. You won't tell me, will you, Danny? You won't tell on me, would you? [SCREAMING] - Jennifer, stop it! Stop it! Jennifer! Stop it! [JENNIFER CRYING] Allyson, help me! Jennifer, stop it! [JENNIFER WHINING LOUDLY] [GASPING] [LOUD BREATHING] - Jennifer's all right. I, I don't know what happened. - (CRYING) Why did she do it, doctor? I thought you said Jennifer was withdrawn. - Withdrawal was an acute reaction to her real condition. - Dr. Masters. Perhaps I shouldn't have come here at all. - I don't think there's any point in our talking about your leaving, Ms. Beale. You forget you were very anxious to take this job. I made Special provisions for you to be here. (HYSTERICALLY CRYING) I realize that, but I don't know what to do. - I'm the doctor and you're the nurse and what I do decides what you will do. - I'm all right now. I just need to get some rest. JUDGE: Many uncaring left me carrying and the livid one. Many will sell our skin left for the white tailed eagle to care. Left for the horn neck raven to render. And gave to the garbage war hole to gorge it and that great beast the will for the world. - Some night soon, the doctor's going to help you Cameron. - Gibberish. - The doctor will help you. - Masters has nothing to give me. - I ain't talking about Deeny. - I doubt that you know what it is you are talking about. I should go. - Dr. Stephens knows Ms. Charlotte and Ms. Charlotte knows Dr. Stephens. That's right. He's going to help her too. He don't want her here just now. Deeny wants her though. Deeny told me. - Of course Masters doesn't want Beale to leave, you idiot! - Sometimes, Doctor Stephens tells me about Ms. Charlotte. I killed Dr. Stephens with my axe. [LAUGHTER] DR. MASTERS: Sam. Sam What are you doing in here? You haven't finished your chores. I want you to go sweep the kitchen. - Then can I have a Popsicle? - Yes, you can have a Popsicle. Ah, Sam's beautiful, isn't he, Judge? No past, no future, only the present. For him Dr. Stephens will always be in the present. Wish we could all think of him that way. Judge. Judge, your floor is dirty. Now it's your responsibility to keep your room clean and I want you to take care of it now! - You had a real baby once, didn't you honey? - This is my baby. - Jeez, I feel sorry for you. You really think that's a real baby. - Baby. - Knock it off! You moron! - Allison. Allison, you got very nice hair and nice skin. You're soft. I like you. [MANIACAL LAUGHING] [ALLYSON CRYING] [DANNY LAUGHING MANIACALLY] - My name is Oliver W. Cameron. Judicator of the court of special sessions. Please examine the evidence. - Judge, would you've done that to me? - My name is Oliver W. - I'm asking you. - My name-- - Judge-- - Is-- - Please love me. I need somebody to love me. - Don't touch me! - You're all alike. Danny, Jaffee, I love you. And you trying to be so high and mighty. Get out! No, no, please, I need you to help me. About something else I mean. I know you can keep a secret. Judge, I've got me a man. Yeah, I saw him yesterday. Right here. Oh he's sweet with beautiful-- I think maybe he's gone. I think maybe he's looking for me and he can't find me. He's the most beautiful man anywhere and he loves me. - You always did have an eye for such things. - Judge, he wants me. (WHISPERING) Please help me find him. - Naturally, I must weight this new evidence very carefully. - (CRYING) Oh Judge, please. - Hi sarge. Let me see. Back off, they're on their way. - Let me see. - Move it! - There's nothing there. You're crazy! - Get out! [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] - What was that shouting all about? Sergeant. I've told every one of you about this sort of thing but you refuse to adhere to my discipline. Haven't I told you what time the lights are to be out in every room? - Yes sir, you have. I take it then that you're contesting my discipline. Is that it? Answer me. My authority here in the sanitarium is going to remain absolute, unchallenged and totally unimpeachable. Do you understand? Hold out your hand. I hate to punish anyone. I loathe it. My domain here is going to never be challenged again. Do you understand? My office, my profession, my charge, my liability, my suffering for your good. Never to take the fine balance of all that, ever again. Goodnight, sergeant. - (CHEERFULLY) Good morning, Sam. What could be troubling you this early? - A whole lot of things, Ms. Charlotte. - Oh. Such as what? - Dr. Stephens. He's worried about things. - Oh, I see. - He wanted me to talk to you. - What have you got there? Where did you get this? Who gave you this, Sam? - He said you'd know. You'd understand. He wants to help you, Ms. Charlotte. - Who wants to help me? What are you talking about? - The doctor. - Oh, Dr. Stephens I suppose. Well thank you very much, Sam, but I think we should talk less foolishly about all this. - I'm the only one who can tell you, Ms. Charlotte. Dr. Stephens is going to help you. You should take the watch. NURSE BEALE: This kind of day seems to take away all your troubles. For a while anyway. Do you have a family, Danny? I thought you mentioned your mother once. Where did you live when you were young? - Miami Beach. - Oh yes. Your mother was in business wasn't she? - Yeah. a massage parlor. - I remember. - This is for you. - Thank you, Danny. I guess it's time we should go in. - Sure. [MANIACAL LAUGHTER] [SCREAMING] - He needs watching. I'm sure you know. We can be sure there will be other times. Other times for other things. Unlike your friend Danny, I choose only perfect moments. Perfect moments to work out perfect destinies for so many lives. - (WHISPERING) Get out. I believe there will be a more perfect time. - Two vials of lithium bicarbonate and one vial of Verbactal You're sure they're missing? - Very sure. They were taken from a new container. - Well, this is really quite serious. Have you checked all the rooms? - Well just about, except for Danny's and Jennifer's. - But you have checked Cameron's and Jaffee's. - I checked those first. - Well, I'll have to go through all of this personally. Thank you. - I got to tell Deeny. Deeny! [CRYING] [SCREAMING] - Deeny! Deeny! - What is it, Sam? - I can't find her. I can't find her anywhere. I've got to find her. - Well what is it? What do you want with her? - I've got to show her, down where I got the Popsicle. What is it? What's down there? Come on. I'll show you. - Sam, I don't have time to play right now. I'm busy. - (WHISPERING) Come on. Come on. I'll show you. Come on. She ain't here, but I'm gonna show you. - Sam, what is this? - Come on. - Are you just putting me on? [SCREAMING] (CRYING) Oh God! No! He loved me. Sweet Jesus Christ! Oh he loved me! [CRYING] - Allyson! What's wrong? [ALLYSON CRYING] Allyson, calm down! Tell me what's wrong. Calm down. What's wrong, Allyson? Calm down and tell me what's wrong. - She killed him. She killed him. - Who are you talking about? - He loved me. He told me that he loved me and she killed him because he loved me. Masters. Masters killed him because he loved me, Charlotte. She's a murdering crucifying same insane maniac! She's insane, Charlotte! - Dr. Masters? - She's no doctor! She's just like the rest of us here and she killed him. You didn't know that, did you? She's a patient of Dr. Stephens. She's a schizophrenic just like me. She can't control her emotions anymore than I can. - Where is Dr. Masters now? - Oh Ms. Charlotte. - I remember you told me who he was. - Charlotte, you've got to believe me. All these things that have been happening since you came here. Masters did it. She cut out Mrs. Callingham's tongue! And she killed my man! Masters did it! - How do you know? - She's a patient like me, Dr. Stephens' patient. She pretended to be a doctor. He let her play and she was pretending when you came and you believed her, Charlotte. - No that's not true, Allyson. - Oh yes it is true. Why do you think she won't let you leave? Why do you think she wouldn't let anybody in? Anybody who threatens to expose her, Charlotte. She'll kill them! - How do you know? - She'll kill anybody that threatens to expose her and she'll kill you! - OK. OK. [ALLYSON CRYING] - Mrs. Callingham why do you sneak around like this? Mrs. Callingham, who did this to you? Your tongue. - Ma-- - It was her? It was Masters? Oh God! It's true? She's a patient here? A patient of Dr. Stephens? Oh my God. - Judge! - Stay away from me. - Is it true? Is it true about Masters? - Then you know too. - I've got to hear it from all of you. You know already. It's too late. We know about you. - About me? - We've been informed about you. The verdict is unanimous. You too are a patient, my dear. - (CRYING) No! That's not true! I've got to get out of here. - Oh God! You killed her too, just like you killed my man and he really loved me. Geraldine! He loved me! - You're upset, Allyson. I think you murdered your own father. I'll get you something to help you sleep. - No. I'm not going anywhere. You're not going to touch me. We know all about that sleep. Your little doctor bit's over. Yeah, that's right. I've told Ms. Beale. She knows. - What does she know? She know how I worked? How I trained to be the best? And I could have been. (CRYING) Except for one insignificant life. One mistake. I could've saved thousands. Then I will. I'll help everyone. I'll help you, Allyson. Hold out your arm. - You told me she was a patient too. - Give me your arm. - Don't you touch me with that! - You shouldn't have done that. I can't sleep now. I have to take care of my patients. - Operator! Why don't you work? There's no use. I can't find the way out. - Everything's all right now. Don't worry. - Oh my God! It's all right. - What's happening? - I told you. You don't have to worry about her anymore. - What have you done to her, Allyson? - Don't worry about it. I've taken care of everything. - Allyson, you've got to tell me. - It doesn't really matter anymore. I'm going away. - You're going away? What are you talking about? - He's taking me away. He still loves me, you know. He told me so. [SCREAMING] [MANIACAL LAUGHING AND SCREAMING] - (CRYING) Allyson. Allyson! - Oh. You shouldn't interrupt us on our wedding night. [VOMITING] - Sam. Is there anybody in this room? Oh God! Sergeant? Sergeant. Thank God. Sergeant Jaffee, just please listen to me. - It's 2300 hours. They'll be coming soon. - Do you know what's happening here? - I have my orders. - Sergeant! Is there an attic in this building? Or an outside door? We've got to get out of here. - They'll be coming soon. Go to your post. - (WHISPERING) Oh Sam. - I've been looking all over for you. Here. - What is it, Sam? - Dr. Stephens said you should read it. What? - Take it Ms. Charlotte. - Dr. Stephens wrote this? Dr. Stephens is alive? - Oh. How could you have known, Sam? Sam? - Where is she? - Who? - The patient. Ms. Beale. - She's got to get out of here. - Oh no. She's sick. I've got to help her. I've got to find her. - It's too late. The trial has been held. The verdict is guilty. Guilty. - Who are you to make a decision? I'm in charge. I'm the doctor here. - The court has made a decision. You are no longer in charge. - I am in charge. I am in charge! I've allowed you privileges and liberties. Even after what you did to Dr. Stephens, I let you keep your little toy. You wouldn't take that away. - I'll take it away. I'll take it away. I'll lock you in your room. Where is she? - My name is Oliver W. Cameron. - (SCREAMING) Where is she? Jurors consult. My name is-- - Sam? Sam? Sam? Sam? Sam? [SCREAMING] (CRYING) Oh my God! No! Dr. Stephens. No! [CRYING] - Look at me. You see a saint? You are incurable. Only faithful live here. Only he honors me. Faithful. Faith before a saint. SAM: Deeny. Is she bad? She's sick. She's filthy. Keep her upstairs. [CRYING] - Sam! No don't! Sam! No! - Correct conscience. MS. BEALE: No! No! Sam, please help me. Sam! Sam, please help me! Sam! [SCREAMING} Sam! Sam! No! Sam! No! Sam! Please Sam, try to understand. You got to help me, Sam. - Deeny's coming back. - Sam, Deeny is insane. She's very sick, Sam. She's gonna kill us. She's gonna kill you. Sam, Deeny doesn't love you anymore! She's gonna kill you! - You took my boat. You killed Dr. Stephens. You're bad! MS. BEALE: No Sam. No. - Sam, she is so sick. So sick. But we've got to help her, Sam. Go in and cut out the sickness and return her to innocent. We do. (ECHOING) We do. - No Deeny! - Sam! Sam! - Wait. What do you want? What are you doing? I'm the judge here. [SCREAMING] - Sam. There's nobody around. She's locked all the doors. I can't find the keys and the windows are barred. - OK Ms. Charlotte. I'll show you. Come on. - Sam, come on. We're free. Sam, come on. - (CRYING) Mama. [SAM CRYING] - Get out and never, never, come back. [THUNDER]
