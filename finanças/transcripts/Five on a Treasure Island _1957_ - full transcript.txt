Get out of my shop! - Don't you dare to hit him! - Mind you're own business. - Leave him alone. - Let me kill this... You're a wicked man. I've a good mind to tell the police. - But look of the damage he's done. - Is he yours? Mine? No! He's some stray. Ought to be put asleep. - You mean killed? - Of course I do. You're nothing but a great big bully. It's all right, Jan. I'll look after him. Shipwrecked treasure... Kirrins trading ship returned from the China Seas sank with all hands by Kirrin Island. The secret of the treasure and where it is hidden on the island went down with the ship. Why, Georgina. What's this? - I found him, Mother. - Found? Well, you better take him back where he came from. I can't. He's astray. Can't we keep him? He'll upset your father. I can persuade him. I know I can. If he's in a good mood. - Father, please. - Yes, what is it? Hi Cmdr. Mainbridge. - Father, can we keep this dog? - Dog? What dog? No, no, no. I can't have barking and noise while I'm working. You see, he likes you. Do let him stay. Alright, but only if he's good and quiet. He will be, won't you? Oh, do be quiet. Well, George, what's his name? I don't know. I'll call him... Timothy. Timothy? You see? Hello, Jim. I found a way to make some easy money. - Sounds interesting. What is it? - This is big. I've got a clue to the Kirrin treasure. That's really big. I'll be right over. We must go and get lunch. Very soon your cousins will be here. - Who did you say? - Don't say you've forgotten! Julian, Dick and Anne are coming to stay over a few days. Yes, of course. Don't go. The Gay Viking should be by at any moment. You should be very proud of your father. The Gay Viking's one of the most up to date vessels in the navy. There she is. Isn't she terrific? Well, I'm just getting along. Let me have the drawings and calculations as soon as possible. Get off my desk. Off. A week's tiresome, complicated work. Now I shall have to do the whole lot again. Please don't be cross, father. - It wasn't Tim's fault. - Not his fault? I should like to know whose fault it was. Get that dog out of the house. I never want to see the horrible animal again. I'm sorry, George. I'm afraid you'll have to take him away. Come along, Tim. - Poor Georgina. - Poor me. I shall have to start all this lot again. Jan. - Oh, won't they let you keep him? - No, Tim's in awful trouble. So you're in trouble then, boy, are you? What's his name? Tim? Yes. You can leave him with me. Oh, thanks, Jan. I hoped you'd say that. I'll give you my pocket money for his food. Don't worry, I'll look after him for you. I've got to go now and meet my cousins. Come in, Anne. Just put your things down there. Steady, dear. I expect you'd like lunch right away, wouldn't you, Dick? You bet! - You can wash your hands along there. Julian, I'm afraid this place is a rather mess. But we're moving out. Yes, this house is much too expensive to run. But we're not going till the end of your holidays. Oh, good. Oh, that's a nice doll, Anne. - She's not very well. - Oh, dear. She hurt her arms so I need to speak to her. Well, I hope she's hungry. Lunch is already. There you are, Anne. Thank you. Where is Georgina? She's not usually so late, but she had something important to see to. Here's yours, Dick. Now, you sit down over there. Oh, Julian. You sit beside Dick, could you? Hello, Uncle Quentin. Hello. Margaret, I think I'll have my lunch on a tray in the study. All right, dear. You mustn't mind your uncle. He's very busy. If there's anything you want, just to help yourselves. All right, thanks. Salad cream, Dick? Yes, please, Dick. Thank you, Dick. Hi, Jim. - What's all this about? - Have a look at this. Now, the writing on the back. Shipwrecked treasure. Very interesting. Well, what's the plan? We can't talk here. Come inside. Now, I'll tell you exactly what we're going to do. You must be Georgina. No, I'm not. Then who are you? I'm George. - I only answer to George. - Why? I hate being a girl. Well, why'd you hate it? I like doing what boys do. Climbing and swimming, sailing boats. Don't you? - I don't know Georgina. - I don't answer to Georgina. We don't care what they call you. - Anyhow, George is quite a nice name. - And you do look like a boy. Don't you simply hate being a girl? No. - We'd like to go bathing after lunch. - I'm going fishing. All right. Go find our own bathing place. All the same, we would like you to come with us. I only make friends with people if I like them. So do we. We may not like you, of course. No, you may. All right. I'll show you the way now. Come on. Gosh! Look at that island. What's it called, George? That's Kirrin island. Come on. That Kirrin island, who does it belong to? It's mine. At least it will be one day. Belongs to father now. It can't be worth much. It's all rocks. You're wrong, it may be very valuable. How's that, Georgina? - Sorry, I mean George. - It's all right. Got a pencil, anyone? Here's some chalk. Thanks, that will do. Mind or you'll cut yourself. This is the island. And here's the ruined castle on top. Just off the island here, there's an old wreck ship. The wreck's been down here off Kirrin Island for as long as anyone can remember. So what do we do about it? You're going to buy the island from Quentin Kirrin. So that no one can stop us searching. Exactly. The Kirrin's hard up. He'll sell it cheap. Captain Zachary! Mr. James Barker. Jim to you. We've got a job for you. Shipping a cargo of treasure out of the country. Easy. I'll be ready any time you want me. But first we must get over to the island and try and find that wreck. The wreck is here. Gosh, how exciting. I wish we could find the treasure. So do I. Then I could give it to father. He's awfully short of money. Is that why you're leaving your house? - Yes. - Can we go and explore the island? - I must go and get Timothy. - Who is Timothy? That's probably one of her friends. Here's, Timothy. Why, it's a dog. Hello Timothy, old chap. He's super. I bet he's a champion. Oh, he's sweet. Whose is he? Mine. But that's a secret. He's a wonderful dog, George. You must be proud of him. He is grand, isn't he? Hey, those were meant for all of us. - Have one. - No thanks. You don't like toffee? You must. Oh, why not? I won't take anything if I can't pay it back. But you can. I haven't any papa's money to buy sweets. It all goes on Timothy. How can I pay back? By letting us share Timothy. And you've got a castle and an Island. - And a jolly exciting wreck. - How about it? Is it a bargain? All right. Thanks. George, can we go over to the castle? Yes, let's go down to the boat. Bring the engine, Julian. All right. So this is Kirrin island. Look out. You're going straight to the cliff. It's alright. It's the entrance to my secret cove. - What's the idea? - There's kids. I can't think how they landed. They mustn't see us here. Tim, come back! Tim, where are you? Can Tim escape? Come next week and see. Episode Two diving to Danger. Hello everyone. Here's the next part of our story. The Famous Five and our adventures on Kirrin Island. I'm Julian and this is Georgina. George for short because she hates being a girl. This is my brother Dick. And here's my sister Anne with Tim. That's the dog. George was telling us about her island. And just off the island there's a wrecked ship. But what those kids didn't know was that my friend Luke Undown - had found a clue to the missing... - ... shipwrecked treasure. The secret of the treasure and where it is hidden on the island went down with the ship. So Luke sent for me and we planned to buy the island. The Kirrin's hard up. He'll sell it cheap. And then if we found the treasure, captain Zachary would smuggle it out of the country for us. But first we must get over to the island and try and find that wreck. But the kids were on their way to the island too. And we knew that if they saw us there, our plans would fail. Their dog nearly gave us away. Super. You think so? We all think it's smashing. I am glad you brought us. So am I. I never brought anyone else. You're the first. Can you see the wreck from here? Come and look down here. - Golly, what's a long way down. - The wreck's down there. I can't see it. It's not right here. But when you're swimming underwater, low tide, you can see it. Where is it exactly, George? It's in line with this window and Kirrin house about 25 yards offshore. I can't see anything. You won't unless you know how far to swim down. Can't we dive down to it? I've often tried, but it's too deep. Well, let's have a shot at it. We'll have to wait for the tide to go down. Anyway, we better go back for supper. Father's always so angry if I'm late. I say, he's a bit fierce, isn't he? He doesn't mean to be. It's just that he worked so hard in the Gay Viking. The Gay Viking? What's that? A new petrol boat for the navy. - Is that it? - Yes. What's special about it? It's full of secret equipment. Has it radar and atomic rockets? I don't know, but it's a marvellous boat and father worries an awful lot about it. Come on. Look, it's Jan. Why couldn't Timothy come with us? Because I'm not allowed to keep him at home, that's why he's a secret. - Don't tell mother and father, will you? - You can trust us. Margaret, you know those children have only just come in. It really is too bad. I know, but don't be cross with them. - All right. - Hello, aunt Margaret. Sorry we're late, uncle. We have washed. Have you had a nice day, all of you? Yes, thank you. You went to the island? The island? - It was super. Yes, George is taking us over the wreck tomorrow. Georgina, what's come over you? You've never taken anyone before. I would not unless I liked them. It's good to hear that you like your cousins. I hope they like you. We do, we like Georgina very much. And Timothy. Georgina, why did you kick Anne like that? Leave the table. Come on and finish your meal. - Finished? - Yes. Good. We're all ready to go diving first thing tomorrow morning. And we can get down to the wreck with this. We're the only people who know the secret occurrence treasure is in that wreck. We won't have any trouble with young Georgina. George? here's some bread and cheese as you didn't have any supper. I'm sorry I made that mistake about Tim. You would. I have a good mind not to let you see the wreck. All right. You might take the boys. After all, they didn't say anything. Did it hurt when I kicked you? Look at the bruise. Not bad. That makes us all square. You can come and see the wreck now. Come on, time for bed. We'll get up really early tomorrow and take a picnic. We'll anchor here. That's right. We're in line where the castle keep Kirrin house and the wreck's about 25 yards offshore. We'll be safe here. No one can see us. Don't forget, in line with the Kirrin house. Good luck. It's really deep. Let's have another shot. It's no good. We can't stay down long enough to explore. Just come in now. There's a storm blowing up. Let's find shelter. It's going to be a storm. We'll wait in this cave. Just in time. Golly, what a storm. Poor Tim. He hates it. It's all right, Timothy. - Are you cold, Anne? - A little bit. So am I. Let's light a fire. Good idea. What with? There are plenty of sticks under the jackdaw's nest. I'll go and fetch some. Let's get some food. Here you are. They're fairly dry. Fine, we'll make a fire here. Any paper? Yes, the toffee wrap. Empty, worse luck. Thank you. And the matches? Gosh, it's rough. It's a god job we're not down by the wreck now. I'm worried about those children out in that storm. Yes, so am I. Jan? The children are all right, aren't they? Yes. I just came to tell you they got to the island before the storm broke. Oh, thank goodness for that. It'll soon blow over. Here you are. Better, I feel much warmer now. I'm better for some food. - The sun's coming out. - And the sea's much calmer too. Golly! Look everyone, look. See? That thing sticking up out of the water. It couldn't be. - But it looks exactly like a mast. - It's my wreck. - Now you can get down to it. - Quick! What lies beneath the sea. Come next week and see. Episode Three the Secret of the Wreck. Hello there. You remember me, Julian? Here's the next part of our adventure. Five on a treasure island. Our first meeting with the family at Kirrin house wasn't terribly cheerful. There was Aunt Margaret. I'm afraid this place is a rather mess, but we're moving out. This house is much too expensive to run nowadays. And there was Uncle Quentin. Margaret, I think I'll have my lunch on a tray in the study. Oh, all right, dear. You mustn't worry about your uncle. He's very busy. Then there was our cousin. We didn't get on with her at first. - You must be Georgina? - No, I'm not. Then who are you? I'm George. I only answer to George. But we soon made friends and George took us off to Kirrin Island. That's George in front. Then me and my brother Dick and my sister Anne. We collected Tim, George's dog. Then we tried to swim down to the wrecked treasure ship off Kirrin Island. It's no good. We can't stay down long enough to explore. The children thought they were the only ones to know about the treasure. But that's where they were wrong, because my friend Luke and I had already found a clue. We were after the treasure of Kirrin Island ourselves. And Luke had discovered the wrecked treasure ship too. But a storm interrupted our search. We'd taken shelter on the island when the storm broke, but it soon cleared up. - The sun's coming out. - And the sea's much calmer too. Golly! Look everyone, look. - What is it? - It's my wreck. - Now you can get down to it. - Quick! Off you go. Get out there before the kids come back. Give us the rope, Dick. Is a box or something down there? - There we are. - What is it? I bet it's got the treasure in it. Oh, the kids got there first. Let's go back to the mainland before those kids spoil everything. Here in the tool shed. Oh, it's pretty heavy. Let's put it on the bench. Right. One, two, three. I suppose it's full of treasure. - Gold doubloons. - Or diamonds and rubies. It's supposed to be full of gold, isn't it, George? Yes, my great great great-grandfather seeked. - Come on, let's get it open. - Right. Here goes. I know it's full of gold. I just know it is. - It must be! - Go on, Julian. I can murder those kids. That box must hold the secret of the treasure. The sooner we buy Kirrin Island, the better. Let's start you up and go to Kirrin house now. Yes, and somehow we've got to get hold of that box. It's no good. Let me have a go. Wait a minute. I've got a better idea. - Let's take it upstairs. - What for? To throw it out of the window, of course. - That should bust it. - Right. You go ahead and wait on the terrace. - Super. - That's done the trick. What's going on. What was that noise? Well? We were only throwing something out of the window. Only? - What's this? - Something we found. Well, now you lost it. Give it to me. Come on. I shall take charge of this, and perhaps that will teach you not make such a horrible noise in future. Where did you get this, anyway? Where did you get it? Out of the wreck. That's a likely story. No one can get down there. Don't blame me for telling him. Never mind. You couldn't help it. He didn't believe you anyway. Sorry I kicked you. - Same here. - It's all right. It's a bit sick of uncle taking our box. Why was he so angry? He hates noises while he's working. All this packing, the place is upside down. I can't find anything. Margaret. Yes, dear? Have you seen my book of logarithms? No, I haven't packed it. I should have another look for it. Margaret. Margaret. Yes, dear? Isn't there. Are you sure you haven't packed it? Perhaps you packed it yourself in the hamper. Do not believe I did. - But where's the hamper now? - Beside the front door. Oh, why didn't you say so in the the first place? - Ready, everyone? - Yes. Hurry up. Look, another box. - It's lead. - No wonder it was so heavy. What's this? Only a mouldy bit of paper. It's not paper, it's parchment. It may be jolly important. - Hold on. - It looks like a map. It is. It's my castle. Look, here are some dungeons. There's something written in that dungeon. Ingots. What does that mean? Ingots are bars of gold. And that must be where the treasure's in. Look. Good afternoon, Georgina. We've come to see your father. He's out. Georgina, he's... He's out, but he'll be back for lunch in half an hour. That's an interesting looking old parchment. Sorry, it's private. Just as you like. We'll come back to see your father. It's a business matter. Why did you kick me? You're always kicking me. Because you nearly gave the game away about Uncle Quentin being at home. - He is at home. - I know that's, silly. But we have to get the box back before he finds it missing. Oh, I see. Who were those men, George? I didn't like them. I don't know the thin one, but the big one is Mr. Luke Undown from the village. - I thought he was horrid. - He is. I rescued Timothy from him. Come on. We better take your box back. What's about the map? I'll trace it. There's some tracing paper in the dining room. Auntie, why don't you use a vacuum cleaner? We can't afford one. Never mind. Maybe you'll have one soon. What do you mean? When we find the treasure... Go on with your game, but don't disturb your Uncle Quentin. Good, he's still working. Dick, you keep a lookout on the study while we trace the map. He's coming out. Margaret, now I can't find my trigonometry tables. Oh, they're in the dining room. The trig tables, uncle? I'll get them. Very kind of you, Dick. Carry on. - Where are those of those trig tables? - Over there in that box. That's the tracing done. Oh, do hurry up. I better get it myself. Here it is. You're not much help, are you? Sorry. Now what? Good afternoon, Mr. Kirrin. May we see you for a moment? You'd better come in. I'm very busy. This is my business associate, Mr. James Barker. What can we do for you, Mr. Barker? It's very simple. I want to buy your island. Kirrin island? Well, you better come into the study and sit down. I'm in the hotel business, you see, and I want to develop Kirrin Island as a holiday resort. George, come and help me over the table here. George, will you get some water from the kitchen, please? Mr. Barker was wondering whether Kirrin Island might be for sale. Georgina, don't stand there dreaming. I can offer you a very good price for it. - Wonder what those men want? - I don't know. I don't think it's any of our business. Sorry. Well, I might say that seems a very fair offer. We'll bring the agreement for you to sign this afternoon. That seems a very interesting old box, Mr. Kirrin. Do you think so? Yes. I might even be able to sell this for you in my shop. You're welcome to try. Right so, might be worth quite a bit. Thank you very much, Mr. Kirrin. We'll be back later with the agreement for you to sign. Then Kirrin island will be yours. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Who will find the treasure first? Come next week and see. Episode Four on the track of the Treasure. Were you all here last time? Well, you'll remember what happened and what trouble we were in. We found the wreck of George's great, great, great-grandfather ship. Everyone thought the treasure was lost. George and I swam down to it while Dick and Anne and Tim watched from the boat. Then something wonderful happened. We found a box. We bought it to Kirrin house to see if the treasure was inside. We were disappointed. There wasn't any treasure. But there was an old map which showed where the treasure was hidden. Ingots. What does that mean? Ingots are bars of gold. Uncle Quentin took the box away from us. But we managed trace the map first. And then Luke and I came on the scene and started to carry out our plan. What can I do for you, Mr. Barker? It's very simple. I want to buy your island. That was bad enough, but what happened next was even worse. It seems a very interesting old box, Mr. Kirrin. You think so? Yes. I might even be able to sell this for you in my shop. You're welcome to try. Right so, might be worth quite a bit. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Kirrin. We'll be back later with the agreement for you to sign. Then Kirrin Island will be yours. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - You can't sell my island. - But Georgina of course we must. Then all our money worries will be over. But it's my island and my castle. You said that'd be mine. Georgina, be sensible. It means you won't have to leave this house. What shall we do? If those men buy the island, we've had it. It's worse than that. They've taken the box now. Couldn't you stop them? How could she without telling uncle we knew where the map was? And that Julian stole it out of the study. Gosh. Now they will know this treasure! ingots. There it is. As large as life. Splendid. Now we know where the treasure is. We must get that island today. Don't worry about that. Kirrin jumped at the offer. Wait a minute. Those kids have seen the map. Look at it. They'll never remember all this. Anyway. We've still got this tracing. What good is it now? Kirrin island doesn't belong to them yet. It will do tonight. Well, what are we waiting for? Come on. - We want some torches. - I know where they are. You'll get a crowbar and spade from the tool-shed. - Right. - I'll get my doll. Hurry up. Dick, get a rope from the tool-shed. Go, hurry up. What are you doing? You're lunch is getting ready. Oh no, mother. Don't you remember? We've got a picnic on the island. Oh, so you have. I'd forgotten. Let's have an axe. Come on, Dick! Get an axe. Quentin, lunch is ready. What is all this? The place is a shamble. Really? These children! - I think that's all. - All ready now? - As soon as you like. - Fine. Kirrin will sign the agreement and sell the island today. They we'll get over there and move the treasure into our boat. Captain Zachary, you can pick us up in the bay. - Right. - Wait a minute. You don't suppose those kids will find the stuff first? Without this map? Not a chance. I'll go and fetch Tim. Hello, Jan. Hello, Tim. - We're going on a treasure hunt. - Going where? Over to my island. We've got a map showing where the treasure is. Have fun. Bring some back for me, will you? George! Quick! Stop the engine, George. Now we've lost the tracing. Good dog. Fetch it. Fast, Tim. Faster. Look, he's almost got it. He's got it. Good, old Tim. Come on, Tim. Come back. Come on, Tim. You're nearly there. Get ready to catch him, George. - Don't splash. - That was a narrow squeak. What a lucky thing we had Tim with us. Thank goodness the map's all right. - Got it all up here at last. - Let's start searching the gold. Yes, all right. Here's the map. Now we must find the way into the dungeons. It sure to be covered up with earth by now. Those marks look like steps going down. What do you suppose this round mark would be? It's probably the old castle well. Yes, I know. It'd go right through the dungeons to reach fresh water. Come on, let's start. It's no use being in such a hurry. We've got to find where to start. I think I know where. These steps start just by the old tower. Come on. It's ruined now, but I know where it is. This must be the place. Nothing here. We better have another look at the map. All this work for nothing. We'll never find it. Of course we will. Now, let's see. If only we could find a landmark. We could measure the distance to the steps. Look. The steps are quite near the well. The well shouldn't be hard to find. - It was bang in the middle. - Yes, it is. Let's go and look. Tim. Tim. I can hear him down there somewhere. There he is. Tim, thank goodness you're safe. George, it's the well. Be careful. Those rungs look a bit shaky. There's water at the bottom. Now Tim's found the well, we know where we are. The way to the dungeons must be over here, about 15 yards. Let's pace it out. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... ... 7, 8, 9, 10, 11... ... 12, 13, 14, 15. Well, there's nothing here. Let's look at the map. Perhaps we went in the wrong direction. The steps are under the building. Let's look over there. That must be the same distance. What a peculiar place is this. This must be it. Lets start clearing the ground. And hurry. Those men must be with uncle Quentin by now. Ah, the agreement. Haven't you get this done quickly! Why, of course, Mr. Kirrin. It has to be signed. It's no good. I can't read this print without my glasses. I'm hungry. No wonder! We've forgotten about lunch. I haven't. I don't want to stop now. I'm sure this is the place. I know, Dick and I will get some food and bring it back to you. Yes, and light a fire and have lunch and tea together. So near and yet so far. If only he wasn't selling the island. Perhaps father will change his mind. Now, where's my pen? Well, Quentin, shouldn't you read it? Here, Mr. Kirrin. Use mine. Thank you. Here. Thanks. - Pass matches, please. - Matches, Dick. Matches. Gosh, there's the Gay Viking. Hurry up with the matches. If those men buy the island, will the treasure belong to them? Yes, I suppose so. It's like when you buy a doughnut, you get a jam inside as well. It's no good. I can't make this thing right. Well, sure you're not going to sign without reading it. I can't spend all day on this. I've got too much work to do. It'll take you a moment. I think Commander Mainbridge is right, Quentin. Read it first. All right. If you say, so. I shall find some time this evening. Are you sure this is the right place? Absolutely certain. You were absolutely certain last time. If you're so clever, why didn't you find a place? Time off. - We're stumped. - Doesn't matter. We can wait till tomorrow. We can't wait. Look. Smoke. Those kids are there again. Quick, let's get them before they discover anything. Hey, mind where you're turning that tea! - What's up? - I sat on something hard. This is it. This iron old ring. Iron old? That's what we've been looking for! What is it? It's a slab that leads the way to the dungeon's steps. Is this the way to the treasure? Come next week and see. Episode Five Trapped in the Dungeon I'm Jim, remember? Luke and I were plotting to steal the treasure when we saw something on Kirrin island that upset our plans. Smoke. Those kids are there again. Let's get them before they discover anything. Those children were dangerous to us. We found the secret to the lost Kirrin treasure. Ingots. There it is as large as life. Splendid. Now we know where the treasure is. We must get that island today. Don't worry about that. Kirrin jumped at the offer. Wait a minute. Those kids have seen the map. Oh, but look at it. They'll never remember all this. But what if they did remember and found the treasure first? Things started to go wrong for us. First, Commander Mainbridge stuck his nose in. Sure you're not going to sign without reading it. Then Quentin Kirrin put off signing the agreement to sell us the island. And all the time we knew the children were on the island searching. It's clear now. Stand back, everyone. - Oh, it's stuck. - Here, let me have a go. Whew I can't shift it. You try, Julian. All right. - It's stuck all right. - What rotten luck. Let me think. There must be something we can do. Yes. Where is Anne? Here I am. I thought if we tie this to the ring, we could all pull. Well done, Anne! All together! One, two, three, pull. And again. Once more. Jen, I want to take my boat out. Is it ready? Will be in about ten minutes, Mr. Undown. Run quick, can you? This is it. Now for the dungeons. Isn't it strange? Which way shall we go? Let's try this one. Look, water! - Salt. - It must be down to the sea. We can't go any further this way. I wish I knew what those children are up to. Tell me they were going on a treasure hunt. Come on now, get a move on. We're in a hurry. Yes, sir. - Let's go that way. - Let's go that way. I'm following Tim. How would we go that way? That's the way we've just come, silly. Let's follow George. Look at this. It's bolted. And it's locked. - I bet be treasure is inside. - I'm sure it is. Come on then. Ready? All together. It's no good. The bolts are on this side, so it must open towards us. - We'll have to break it open. - Let's go and get the axe. Wait a minute. We didn't come this way before. It's also big and rambling. - Suppose we're lost? - Have to stay down here till we die. Dick, will we ever get out of here? No, we'll stay down here forever and ever. What will we live on? Mice? What's the matter, Tim? I'm sure I've seen that place before. I know, it's the well. It's daylight at the top. Come on. I think this is the way out, along here. Look, there are the steps. - Thank goodness. - Now let's get the axe. - You can mark the way with this. - Good idea. The rope's ran out. Now we should lose our way all over again. Got any chalk? Sure, Dick! Hurry up, Dick! Here we are. Thanks. Come on, George. Let's give me some room. What's the matter, Dick? I think a splinter flew out. - Does it hurt? - I don't feel too bright. You better go into the fresh air for a bit. I'll take him. I know about first aid. All right. That's it, over there. Listen. They're all down there on the dungeon. We'll lock them in there while we get away with the treasure. Come on. - It stopped bleeding. - Doesn't hurt so much, either. I think that's done it. Look, ingots! Gosh, they're heavy. It's a fortune! Better? I'll be all right in a minute. We must tell Dick and Anne we found it. Listen... That's them now. Dick, Anne. We found it. All right, turn around. Go on. Back inside, both of you. Keep that dog down unless you want trouble. Turn your back against the wall. Here's the gold nice and handy for us to take away. You can't do that. Who's going to stop us? We might as well load the stuff now. Steady. Do as we tell you and you won't get hurt. - Where are your two friends? - Don't tell him. Wherever they are, you're going to get them to come here by writing them a note telling that you found the gold. No, don't. He wants to get the others down here as well. I won't do it. If you don't write that note, I'll blow that dog's brains out. You'll have to shoot me first. - Now what do you say? - No, don't shoot him. I'll write it. Put down what I say. We have found the gold. Come down at once and see it. Now sign your name. George... Georgina. How are you going to get it to them? - Haven't thought of that, have you? - Yes I have. The dog can take it. Now tell the dog to find your friends. Finding Dick and Anne. Go on. Just as well as your dog does as he's told. Hello, Tim. What's this? We have found the gold. - Come down at once and see it. - Oh, good. Let's hurry. Hold a second. There's something funny about this note. - What? - George has signed herself Georgina. But she hates being called Georgina. I know. It's almost like a warning. How long that dog has been gone? Their friends should be here by now. They're taking a long time. Don't worry. They'll soon be here. We'll lock you all up together until we've moved the gold. - It isn't yours to move. - It will be. Nothing funny about that note, was it? - How could it be? - You made it. The dog's there. - Without the note. - Where are the other kids? We're not waiting for them. We'll have to find them. All right, let's go. No, you stay here. Don't worry. You'll soon have company. - No sign of them around here. - They must be out. Look! What should we do now, Dick? We'd better get back to our boat. - And leave he's the others? - We've got to. We better tell Uncle Quentin what happened. There they are. Stop them getting to that boat. How can they get away? Come next week and see. Episode Six Escape Danger. Remember how the children discovered an old box in the wrecked treasure ship? Well, they discovered too much for our liking, so we got hold of the box ourselves and we persuaded Mr. Kirrin to sell us the island. Of course, he didn't know there was treasure on it. We'll be back later with the agreement for you to sign. Then Kirrin Island will be yours. But the children got to the island first. They found the treasure before we did. We must tell Dick and Anne we found it. Listen... That's them now. Dick, Anne. We found it. All right, turn around. Go on. Back inside, both of you. The other two, Dick and Anna, escaped. We got Georgina and Julian locked up safely in the treasure room. It's no good. We'll never break out. I do hope Dick and Anne are all right. They'll be all right if they can get to the boat. And get some help. Look! Let's lock up the opening. Now we're properly stuck. - Well, that's got them bottled up. - Now we'll go and block the steps. If we can get down to the bottom, we can reach the others. So long as the rungs hold up. They're awfully rusty. Well, that should hold them. They're too clever. We can't afford to take any chances. What else can we do? Take the engine and oars out of their boat. Good idea. Then if they do escape from the dungeons, they're still stuck on the island. - Hold on. - Caught me. I'm going to fix up with Zachary and come back to the gold. What a horrible climb. Well, let's go and find the others now. I don't think we've come the right way. Well, I'm not sure either. Let's try this way. All right. Here we are. Not far now. Oh, I don't like this place. I brought you some fish, Mrs. Kirrin. Oh, thank you, Jan. They're lovely. It's been going around the village that you might be moving. - I hope that isn't true. - Yes, Jan. I'm afraid it is. - Hello, Jan. - Hello, Mr. Kirrin. See the children are all right? Yes, they said they were playing treasure hunt. That's not a treasure they'll find. It's all right, Tim. Don't be so miserable. Just been thinking. Suppose this place is haunted. What is it, Timothy? George, Julian! Are you in there? Dick, good for you! Can you get us out? Give me a hand with the bolts. - How did you get down? - By the well. - Where are the men? - They've gone, I think. - But they're coming to get the ingots. - Then we must tell father quickly. Come on. They shut us in. Perhaps we can move it if we all push together. He must have put more stones on top. They've done the same to the well. So we're trapped down here. - There might be another way out. - Another way? Where? I know! The steps that lead down to the water. It must lead to the sea and probably secret cove. But how would you get there? - Swim, of course. - Swim? But we don't know how far it is. Even if you reach the sea, it might not be secret cove. It's our only hope. - I'm going to have a shot. - It'll be an awfully long way. Wait a minute, Julian. - Take this rope. - What for? Tie one end around you. I'll hang on to the other. And if you get into trouble, we can always pull you back. That's an idea. As long as the rope's moving, you know I'm all right. But if it stops, count ten, then pull me back. Do be careful, Julian. What will you do if you get there? When I get there, you mean? I'll come and let you all out. - It's cold. - Good luck. Thanks. Here it goes. 1, 2, 3, 4... Maybe he's stuck. Can we better pull him back? - I don't know. - Dear. I wish he'd never tried. Been still for a long time. 8... Thank goodness! He's still all right. The rope, George, is almost gone. Something's wrong. - I'm sure he's in trouble. - Then better pull him back. He stopped jerking. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... He hasn't moved for a long time. ... 7, 8... - Please, pull him back. - ... 9, 10. It's too light. We've the stuff, captain Zachary. How quickly can you get your trawler to the island? - Less than an hour. - Good. Just time for us to get the gold onto our boat, and then you can pick us up in the bay. Right. I better get back to the harbour. Hello. Are you there? Hello! I'm going to pull the slab in a minute. I want you all to shove when I yell. - All right. - Now! What's this for? We're taking it to father. Is enough to believe it. Nice work, Julian. I thought we'd seen the last of you. - Now what are we going to do? - Get back to our boat. But they're boat's miles faster than ours. They'd cut us off if we tried to get back to the mainland now. Let's see where they are. Look, they're coming. When they come down to that dungeon, they'll go straight to the treasure room. - We have to go down and shut the door - And cover up the entrance again. Or else they'll know we've got out. Then when they go in, one of us can slam the door and knock them in. All right. Let's go quickly, before they get in. I'll go down. - No, let me. - Why? Then you can close it up again after the men, just in case they break out of the room. But how will you get out? - I know my way up the well. - You're right. Hurry up. Good luck, Dick. They'll be here any minute. Why were those men in such a hurry? What's it, dear? Who's in a hurry? Quentin thinks of nothing but work. Have some tea. You mean that man Luke Undown brought about buying the island? Yes. I feel sure there's something wrong about him. - Yes, I'd rather agree with you. - But Quentin's determined to sell. We could certainly do with the money. This is turning out better than I'd hoped. Now we don't even have to buy the island. Just as we left it. The kids must still be down there. We got them just where we want them. And we've got you just where we we want you. They're very quiet in there. Put themselves asleep, I dare say. The kids. They've gone. Can the five save the treasure now? Come next week and see. Episode seven at the Mercy of the Waves. Hello everyone. We'd found the treasure that belonged to George's family. It was hidden in the dungeons on Kirrin Island. It's the ingots. Gosh, they're heavy! It's a fortune. And then we lost it to Luke and Jim. They locked us in the dungeons while they got a boat to take the gold away. So we're trapped down here. I managed to swim out through the cave. It was a long way, but luckily I got through. Then I let the others out. When Luke and Jim came back, Dick went down to try and trap them in the treasure room. We hoped we could get away in our boat to fetch help. The kids! They're gone. I hope Dick's trapped him. I bet he has. - Well done, Dick. - It didn't work. What happened? They busted the door open before I could bolt it. Are you alright? I'm all right, but I can't get up. Sorry. Dick, they're coming out. Run for the boat, then. It's the only chance. But we can't leave you here. I'll be all right. We'll all be caught if you stay. Dick's right. It's our job to get help. Yes. Hurry. I'll hold them up as much as I can. We'll never get away. As long as we're together, they'll catch us. But if we split up and all go different ways... Then at least one of us will get to the boat. Anne, while George and I are leading them off you go down to the boat. All right. And I hide in secret cove till you come. Take this. It's our only evidence. Ready? Look! Oh, no, you don't. - That sounds like him. - He's in there. - He's not here. - He must be across the passage. There he is. Look, there they are. - They've taken new oars. - And the engine. We'll have to risk it now. Let them go. They won't get far. That's right. They have no engine and no oars. They'll just drift out to sea. And pile up on the rocks, I dare say. Currents are very dangerous round here. - I suppose they get drowned. - It'll be just too bad. And do hope the children are all right. Of course they're all right. What is the matter with you today? First you're upset about selling the island and now you're all worried about the children. George is usually home by now. It's so late. I must be going. Don't forget to phone the dockyard if you want them. I'll see myself out. Oh, don't worry, Mrs Kirrin. They're probably having the time of their lives. Have an ingot, Dick. Yes, please, Dick. Thank you very much, Dick. Have another ingot, Dick. Yes, please, Dick. Very kind of you, Dick. - It's that kid. - There he is. Got you, my lad. See him, Timmy! Stop. - I'll get him. - Let him go. We'll be in real trouble if he makes us miss that trawler. Hello, Mrs Kirrin. It's not often we see you down here. Jan, have the children come back yet? I haven't seen them. I would because they always bring Tim. Oh, the dog. So you've got him? Yes, Mrs Kirrin. What is keeping them? They said something about a treasure hunt. Find some map or other. Treasure? I wonder if... Anyway, they can't get up to much mischief. Mr Undown and his friend are on the island too. But then they are in a hurry! Yes, they seem to be. Why, what's the matter? Look, I may be wrong, but I'd feel much happier if I knew those children were safe and sound. And you'd like me to go over and see for you? If you would. Bring them back with you, please, Jan. Right. That boy has seen what we're doing. We've got to stop him. Captain Zachary won't risk waiting about now. We must get this gold aboard our boat right away. Hear that, Timmy? If their boat sinks they're sunk. That's the lot. Just as well we found where the boy had put them. - They're heavy. - They solid gold. Come on. Let's get a move on. Will Jan reach the children in time? Come next week and see. Episode Eight the Five Triumphant. Things were going badly for us. Those men had trapped Dick in the dungeons. The rest of us tried to get to the mainland for help but our boat was out of control and drifting onto the rocks. Yes, our plans were working nicely. Currents are very dangerous around here. - I suppose they get drowned. - It'll be just too bad. With the children out of the way The gold on the island was ours. Captain Zachary was to meet us with his trawler for our getaway. Young Dick was still on the island. What could a kid like that do to stop us? And as for the others, Georgina, Julian and Anne I think we've seen the last of them. Look, there's Jan. - Good old Jan! - Thank goodness. Hold on. Jan's throwing us a line. Hold on, Jan. All right. We're sinking. Where's the pullover? I can stop the leak with it. Seems a pity to leave these lying about. Someone might pinch them from Uncle Quentin. Father, quick! We found the gold! One at a time, please. Now then, what is all this about it? Excuse, sir. Look at this. Good heavens. It's solid gold. You were right. Now, what's all this about Dick and those two men? Hello, dockyard? Hello? Hello. I want Commander Mainbridge. Yes, it's important. It's what? It's engaged? It can't be engaged. Look, you must get through somehow. This is urgent. Wait a minute. I swear they were more than this. It's that boy. He's taking a lot of the gold. We got to stop him. Forget about him. We got most of the gold anyway. Commander Mainbridge? Hello, Bob. Now, listen. They're getting out of the country at a trawler. Right, I'll go straight away. In fact, I'll take the Gay Viking. It's Captain Zachary. Forget about the boy. Let's get down to our boat. One more load of ingots and that's the lot. Let's be quick about it. Oh, well, that's that. Can't we catch them in Jan's boat? Not a hope. - Haven't you forgotten something? - What? The Gay Viking. Stand by. Fire a warning shot. Prepare for boarding. Handcuff them. Make a signal. Look, they're signalling. - Can anyone read it? - Yes, sir, I think I can. The... gold... is... safe. Then we shall not have to leave Kirrin? No. And what's more, I'll give you the castle and the island. You deserve it, George. You couldn't have done better if you'd been a boy. I'm going to share my island with the others. But there is one more thing I'd like. I think I can guess what that is. Timothy. - Good dog, Tim. - Then you won't send him away? Send him away? He's the cleverest dog in the world. Transcription and Subtitling LAPORT INC.
