I see some signs of recent vomiting... but no other issues. Have you, uh, eaten anything new recently? Anything that could've made you sick? No, nothing new. Okay. I haven't had much of an appetite lately, though. Okay, well, anything else? Have you been more tired than usual? Oh, I mean, I guess maybe a little bit. Um, everyone has been making fun of me for falling asleep in the makeup chair lately. Okay, Briley, when was your last period? I don't know. Um... maybe a couple weeks ago. This month has just been so crazy. Everything's kind of blurred together. I'm not really sure. Okay... Well, since we can't quite seem to know the cause of the nausea, I'll prescribe some medication for you that will help with any symptoms and knock out any lingering bugs in there, okay? Okay, sounds good, Dr. King, thank you. But before I do that, Briley, I do have to ask you, honey... Have you been sexually active recently? Whew! Well, you look like you're having the time of your life. I'm joking! You look miserable. Come on, look around. Isn't this fun to you? No, not really. I mean, I told you, this isn't really my thing. What? I said it's not my thing! Oh, come on, this is everyone's thing! You just gotta give it a chance. Hey, lighten up! Why are you so serious? What has got you thinking so hard? Oh, what? Is it "New York Girl"? No, no, nothing. I-- Look, I think I'm gonna go home. I'm just really not feeling this, I'm sorry. No, no, no, no, no! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Hold up, just loosen up, okay? Stop thinking so much. Most of the people here weren't feeling it when they fist came here, either, but now look at them. Come dance with me. I don't know. What? I don't-- I don't want to! Un-uh, I wasn't asking. Come on. ♪♪ Hey! Hey, Bri, can you hear me? Hey, uh, Cody. Sorry, uh, it's really late there. I'm surprised you're still up. Is everything okay? Uh, yeah, everything's-- Everything's great, um... I just calling to see how things are going. Things are really, really good, actually. It's just been so crazy busy here. I mean, filming's taking up my entire life, you know? Um... Look, I'm sorry I haven't been able to call much lately. It's just-- It's been so crazy, you know? No, it's okay. I mean, I get it. I mean, everything's been crazy here, too, so... So busy. Sorry, Bri, what-- What was that? No, it's o-- it's okay, I was just saying-- Cody? Hey! Come back to the dancefloor, stud, we're missing you! Co--Cody? Gimme a second, okay? Just one second. Okay. Cody? Hey, Bri... Look, I gotta go. Um... Hey, I think we should just take some time. You know, I just-- I just need some time to figure out how to balance all this, okay? I'll call you soon. Bye. Wait, Cody-- ♪♪ Thank you for meeting me. I know we haven't talked much, but... I kind of feel like you're my only friend out here, you know? Of course. I'm happy to. How are you? I mean, considering. Oh, how am I? I really don't know. I mean, it's just the strangest feeling. Honestly, it just doesn't even feel... real. I mean, how do you comprehend that there's this little thing inside you, and it's gonna grow to be a little boy... ...girl... And that's gonna grow up to be a man or a woman, and have to be living in this world. Whoa. That's a lot. Yeah, sorry, I just... been kind of lost recently. Not really sure what to do about all this. That's understandable. I mean, unless you're, like, planning for it, I think most people feel that way. Yeah, I guess. Do your parents know? I'm sure they'd be a good support base in all this. Yeah, not so much. They kind of haven't been in touch since I started to pursue theater. I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you don't mind me asking, but... What about the dad? Where's he in all this? Does he know yet? No. Um, I tried to tell him, but, you know, I just-- I just couldn't bring myself to do it. Do I know the guy? Don't tell me it's one of the flying monkeys. No, no, no! It's not one of the monkeys! You haven't met him, I don't think, but you've probably heard of him. Just promise you won't tell anybody. Yeah... I promise. Okay, um, it's Cody McClain. Cody McClain?! Like the freaking Cody McClain?! The huge, famous heartthrob actor Cody McClain?! Yeah, that's the one. Oh, my gosh, he's so-- Uh, sorry. I didn't mean to. It's okay. So... why haven't you told him? What's stopping you? Was it just like... one-night stand kind of thing? No, no, no, no, no. It's nothing like that. Um... we'd actually been dating for a couple of years. But, I mean, he's not gonna return my calls. He already told me he wants to take a break and really focus on his career. Plus, I mean, I can't just like jump on a plane to Los Angeles. Why not? They have you blocked out on the schedule for the next couple of days. Why don't you go talk to him? This seems like one of those in-person things, anyway. That was pretty good today. I think they'll-- Oh, hey, I'll see you later. Hey, you two, how are you? Ohh! Hey, Mama. Good to see you. Good to see you too, son. This is pretty cool. It's been a while since I've been on a set with you. This is a little bigger than I remember. Yeah, Mom, that's 'cause Cody's a megastar now. Well, you're not wrong. Always humble, just like I raised you. Oh, guys, this is Hayley! This is my costar. Hayley, this is my mom, Lana, and my sister, Bryce. Nice to meet you. Same to you. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you as well. Cody has told me so much about you! Bryce, are you gonna follow in your brother's footsteps and become a big actor too? Well, if Cody told you much about us, you know that I hate acting. I think most actresses I meet are vain and airheaded. Bryce! No, it's fine. She's right. Most of us are. But us airheads gotta make a living somehow, right? Not all of us can be as gifted as you. Okay, do you guys wanna go see my trailer? Yes, let's do that. Right there. All righty, hope to see you around here again soon! It was nice to meet you, too. I'll see you. Sorry about her. She's not normally like that. It's fine. I'm used to that. Most girls don't like me. I think they feel... threatened. Don't for the life of me know why. Uh, my-- Oh. Ed told me about this place a couple weeks ago, and I just fell in love. I mean, the view and the food. Guys, oh, man... I just had to show you. It's beautiful, honey. We didn't have to go to someplace so... expensive. Oh, Mom, no, it's totally fine. Only the best for my girls. Yeah, Mom, let the big shot pay. I'm not complaining. Excuse me? I'd like your finest Shirley Temple, please. Make it a double. Right away. Thanks, champ. What? So, honey, tell us about filming. Seems like it's going really well. Oh, Mom, it's going amazing. I mean, everyone is so talented, and I really do, I think we're making a great project. Yes, the world is dying to see what happens to Ben Pierson, Secret Agent, next. She going through that teen phase thing? I'm glad you're having a good time. You know, we don't get to hear from you as much now, and... Yeah, Mom, I'm sorry about that. It's just, you know, with everything so busy I barely have time to think, you know? And what about Briley? How is our favorite theater star? Yeah, how is she, Cody? Have you talked to her about your lovely costar yet? No, actually, I haven't. We, uh... We decided we need to focus on our careers right now. You know, with everything being so crazy-- You know, you can only use that excuse so many times before it gets a little old, bro. It's too crazy to keep up with Mom. It's too crazy to keep up with your sister. It's too crazy to keep up with the girl who you wouldn't shut up about marrying some day for two years! But it's not too crazy to go to another press appearance, or to go out to the club with Miss Skankypants costar! Bryce! I have social media, genius. Bryce, that's enough! Whatever. Put it on his tab. I'm sure he can afford it. Thank you. I'm sorry about her. She's just... missing her older brother. You know she's right, though. It wouldn't hurt to call. Check in every now and then. I better go check on her. She's probably not gonna wanna come back in, so we'll just take a taxi back home. Okay. I love you, son. I love you, too, Mom. And, Cody. I know you may not be in a place to hear this right now, but don't be so quick to push aside those who care about you the most in life, okay? And Briley... They don't make many like her. She is one of a kind. Don't forget that. I hate to see you throw that away. Call me. Soon. I will. Okay. Oh, did someone have a wild night last night? Is everything all right? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'll be there in a few minutes. Okay, uh, just remember the press is here today. You know, we have that onset visit. So, gotta look alive, right? Put your game face on. And remember, chemistry. It sells. Right, you feel me? All right, champ, see you out there. Game face! Yeah. Game face. Let me see that. That goes well with this, too. Honestly, this is a nice little combination you got going on. Hey, you ready to put on a show? What do you mean? Oh, you know, giving the fans what they want. Nothing too crazy. Thank you. And, young lady, how can I help you today? Hi, I'm here to see Cody McClain. My name's Briley Williams. I should be on the Friends and Family list. You have an ID? Yes. Okay, you know the drill. This is just a quick live broadcast from the studio. So the filming's going well, what we can expect from the movie, yadda yadda yadda. Nothing new. Sound good? Yeah. Okay, they're on their way. You guys look great, by the way. Showtime. He's right, you know. We do look great together. Yep, there you are. Briley Williamson. You know how to get there? No. Stage Two. Follow the line, can't miss it. Okay, thank you so much. You're welcome, thank you. Hello. Hi, we're on the set of "Ben Pierson: The Shadow Files", and I have an exclusive interview with our two lead actors, Cody McClain and Hayley Ryan. Some of the scenes have been leaked from the movie, and they're very steamy, and I'm just wondering if any of that onscreen chemistry is carrying over off-screen, if you know what I mean? Um-- Okay, well, I'm really glad you asked this question. I know it's been hard for us to keep it quiet. Hey, Briley, right? How you doing? Oh, hi, yeah. Um, I'm okay. We're kind of a thing now! I mean, it's so hard not to be when you have such a strong chemistry, you know? I just need to talk with Cody. Is... he around? No, actually, he's super busy right now. Um, I could take a message, if you want. He's probably gonna be a while. That's okay. Can you just... We practically can't keep our hands off each other. Can you just, um, give this to him for me, please? Yeah, no problem. Oh, you guys, that's so exciting! I'm so happy for you, and I'm sure your fans are so excited to know this, and you guys heard it here first. Okay. See you later. Emerson, honey, it's almost time to go. Are you ready? Oh, sweetie, what's wrong? I don't think this story's gonna have a happy ending, Grandma. It's too sad. Oh, honey. Come here. Now, remember what I said, dear? Not all love stories have a happy ending. But it's about how they end, right? It's about... Wait. What was it again? The journey, Grandma. That's right, the journey! Tell you what. How about I sit here with you and we can read it together until it's time to go? Will that help make it a little less sad? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Let's see. Where did you leave off? This one. "Briley, forgive me for making this brief... What was that?! We're not-- We're not dating! Why did you say that? Cody, chill out! Of course I know we're not dating, but they wanted us to put on a show, give something that the fans could latch onto. I don't understand what the big deal is. Vick, come on, man, this is crazy! I mean, I think it's a good idea. The press loves this kind of stuff, and I say we roll with it. Yeah, okay, just until the movie releases, and then we could have, like, some big tabloid breakup story. No big deal. No big deal? It's a lie. We're lying. Cody, we're actors. It's what we do. We act. It's gonna bring so much attention to our movie. What, you don't want people to think that we're together? I'm-- I'm not saying that. But we're not together. What am I supposed to tell my family? You don't have to tell them anything. Nothing, zip. Look, all we have to do is go to a few parties, get photographed in public together a few times, just to give the press something to talk about. You know, like, keep us relevant, that's all. You think you could manage that? Come on, Cody, look, I know it's a little out there, but this is really good for your career, trust me. Besides, that girl from New York is out of the picture, right, what's her name? Briley. Right, so there's no down side here. Fine, I'll do it. Whatever. But just don't-- don't pull anything like that again without talking to me first, okay? You got it, stud. Hey, lighten up! ♪ It could be fun if you let it! ♪ Mmm! Mwah! She's crazy. She's an actress. What do you expect? You have to be a little crazy if you want to be an actor. You're crazy, too. Anyway, this is what you signed up for, right? Ride this out, and I promise you, you will not regret it. See, out there... You're a star, Cody McClain. We can confirm that Cody McClain and Hayley Ryan are official. We saw their steamy scenes from the set of their new movie, but apparently, these two are fire offscreen as well. Wonder what their celebrity name will be? Cayley? Hody? I don't know if those work at all. --Their celebrity name will be? Cayley? Hod-- But I guess we'll find out. ♪ A land that I heard of♪ ♪ Once in a lullaby♪ ♪ Somewhere over the rainbow ♪ ♪ Skies are blue♪ ♪ And the dreams that you dare to dream ♪ ♪ Really do come true♪ So, what did the big chimney say to the little chimney?

Oh, my gosh, I'm so glad you came! Of course! Thanks for fitting me in today, Dr. King. Aw, anything for you, Dorothy. So, I heard the news. It wasn't a stomach bug after all, was it? No... No, it wasn't. And are we excited? Scared? Nervous? All of the above. Good. That means you're normal. Any other bad symptoms? Has the morning sickness gotten any worse since the last time I saw you? Um... no. I mean, I've had it come and go, but overall it's okay. I'm getting used to it. I have had the strangest cravings, though. I mean, I had never thought about dipping a cheeseburger into a chocolate shake before a couple days ago. I remember that. Now, Briley, I am required to discuss all of your options with you. You are young and healthy, and we don't expect any complications, but... are you considering the possibility of terminating-- Dr. King... I know you're supposed to go over all that stuff with me, but... I just can't think about that right now. Okay, I just... I just wanna make you aware of all your options. And, uh...

See you soon. Hi. Thank you. Hi, could you give us a moment? Sure. Thank you. Hi, Lynn, I'm sorry I'm a few minutes late. I'll get ready fast, I promise. Briley, we need to talk. If this is about me getting sick a lot lately, I'm totally fine. I won't be getting anyone else here sick. I'm sure of it. Briley, why were you late today? I had a doctor's checkup. I just wanted to make sure I got the all-clear. And I did, so... Well, your doctor called the theater company earlier today. They wanted to confirm the insurance for your appointment. I... Briley... I don't know what to tell you. The producers just don't want to take a chance on you having complications because of the pregnancy. But how can they do that? I mean, I-I-I-I-- I'll still be able to perform for a few months before anything changes. And isn't Broadway starting to offer maternity leave anyway? Well, some companies are starting to offer maternity leave for their actresses, but ours isn't one of them. I'm sorry, Briley. I wish that there was more I could do, but... this one is just out of my hands. Lynn, there has to be something I can do. I mean, this isn't right. Honey... I know this is hard to do, but have you considered giving up the baby? After all, you're still a teenager and you have such a bright future ahead of you. I'm not telling you what you should do. I'm just saying that it's an option. I'll tell the producers to hold off on their decision while you think about it, okay? Okay. I'll let you know. Briley? I wish this weren't the case, I really do. But I just don't see another option for you. I'll try and buy as much time with the producers as I can, okay? I don't know how it all got so screwed up. It's like I only saw one path in front of me and I kept walking on it and it led me further and further away from who I am. And now, now I'm stuck. There's no way out. Literally an entire production is riding on my shoulders and-- and I have to play pretend with my real life to pull it all off. What am I supposed to do? Well, sweetie, I don't have an easy answer for you. This is what you wanted, isn't it? A career as an actor? Yeah. Yeah, it was. I just didn't see it going like this, you know? Life rarely ever goes just how we picture it, son. I just-- I don't think I know what I want anymore. For so long, I wanted this career as an actor, and now I have it and-- and I'm just... Not happy? Why don't you call her? No, Mom, she doesn't want to hear from me now. I treated her terribly. I wouldn't be surprised if she never wanted to hear from me again. I can't even imagine being in her position. Seeing everything in the press? I... I'd be so angry. Well, yeah. You're right. And she has every right to be angry with you. But she loved you and you loved her. You owe it to her to at least call. Yeah. You're right. I was scared. I don't want her to hate me. Cody, she may. But you're better off knowing, if you ask me.
