"Speak right, Sayeh!" No more questions. I'm speaking! I only saw the boy for five minutes, How will I know these answers? It's ok. He was throwing up a week ago. I was already weak when you arrive at the hospital. He took serum and was released. What does that mean? Probably, acute intoxication. Are you sure? Do not. That's why I did a test. "Why was that man screaming?" -What man? Your Friend? I said it was just an acquaintance. Need to tell me anything else? Do not. As well? Anything. Is it a special case? Do not. Dr. Nariman knows the family. They are here. They need to do exams. They may have the same thing. Only if it's botulism. The boy had botulism. for sure. They must have eaten the same thing. It only had a different effect. Just food poisoning? May have been intoxicated the blood too. It's rare, but it happens. "Could he have survived?" - I can not say. If you're not diagnosed, can kill in ten days. How many days ago? was he like this? About six or seven days. Do not you hear me? Hello? Hello my sister. I lost my son. He's gone. I'm in mourning. I do not know. He had diarrhea ... and vomiting. He was shaking, he could not eat. I could not even speak Last night. I woke up the Moosa to take him to the hospital. He was all frozen. I need to hang up. Usually, we do not report the cause of death for the family. We send to the legal authorities. But this is a special case. "Do you have another daughter?" -Have. "Did they all eat the same thing?" -As well? Did she eat the same as you did? No, she's breastfed. Does anyone else live with you? Do not. Because? He had food poisoning, of a bacterium called C. botulinum . -Excuse. "Stay outside." No, you can come in. I was explaining. Your son had botulism. It's a rare disease. one kind of food poisoning. Did you eat canned tuna? Do not. And your son? He did not like fish. Any other canned food? Something defeated or spoiled meat? Do not. You need to get tested. They did not feel weakness. This past week? Difficulty swallowing? Same symptoms as your child. What do you mean "spoiled meat"? Meat produces bacteria if you stay indoors. If you enter the body, can kill in ten days. -Moose ... -Calm. -What else? -It is. Do not you remember anything? I am asking for your sake. Do not. Anything. They need to take the exams. If you have symptoms, seek medical advice immediately. He is ready to be identified. The exit permit. has already been issued. My feelings. I want to stay here for a while. It's all right. But do not be late, because the ambulance is about to leave. What did she say, Moosa? Do not say anything now. - She said "rotten meat." -Wait just a minute. -Moose ... - Shut up. Do you know them well? Who? The boy's parents. Why do not you forget that? Do I ask you to explain everything? Do not. The father is hiding something. As well? The mother wanted to talk, but he stopped her. -Are you sure? -I felt. Put in report if you think it's important. -What is it? -What? "Superficial swelling behind the head ". It's nothing important. - There was no bleeding? -Not. "Any break?" -Not. Asked the family about swelling? No, why? It was not necessary. Thank you. You do not come? No, I have to finish. some chips from yesterday. It's all right. Goodbye. Khanroodi, Amir Ali! This way. This way. It's him? -It's him? -Yes. Rest in peace. You can not stay there. May God comfort you. You can take the documents down there. Hello, Mrs. Sahragard. It's Nariman. I have a question. It was you the person responsible for the autopsy of the boy today? That, eight years. Dr. Behbahani You mentioned a swelling, right? There was no fracture? No bleeding? Checked the vertebrae? No break? Did you open it? That can not be a reason.

Why did they stay? To visit the tomb tomorrow. For what? To do what everyone else does. Where were they when he was alive? Is that you? "Worried about us?" "See how you speak ..." When they came, you were leaving. Leila, where is the garbage? Behind the curtain. Find something for dinner. They're hungry. I only needed this. "They came to help us." -I have no money. "Why are you being thick?" - I'm not, I just do not have the money. There is that gororoba that you brought. Do I offer that? Are you being sarcastic now? -I can not? - God, I do not ... Why did you bring that? - Hold it. They'll hear you. "Shall I shut up?" -You should be ashamed. -The guy said it was good. - Then why did he sell so cheaply? - I swear to God I did not know! I hate it when you swear to God. Leila? Leila? Why are you sitting there? You saw him? Who? Amir Ali. Saw. Why did not you leave it? open the coffin? Lets go in.

This decision is not yours. Yes it is. I do not want to be here. I said nothing, And you're very bold. Want to hit me? Go ahead. Did not you hear? I said I did not know. You did not know what? I swear to god. Thought they were sorry for you? They'll listen. Did not think it was weird. to be so cheap? He just said who were not slaughtered. Why not? Why, were they good? They'll listen. He thought they would sell Good meat at this price? -Enough! -What's it? Do you think I'm stupid? You took my son from me. - Hold it. They'll listen. Listen! You think nobody understands?

God is a witness. I... My God. -Hello. -Hello. Can go. I'm going. Some problem? When he did the autopsy yesterday, You did not notice any displacement. of the cervical vertebrae? You asked Sahragard. Why ask me? -Excuse me. -Forget. I'm not asking anything, because you asked me. I will not ask who he is. nor what happened. I will not ask, and you will not say anything. But do not think I'm an idiot. I... I got involved in an accident with them the day before yesterday. At where? Can we go up? - Why did not you call the ambulance? "My insurance was over. If I called the police, It was going to be a problem. But the card said that they took him to the hospital. They took him at dawn, and he died on the way. What do you think it was? I checked the skull. There was no fracture. nor bleeding. Sahragard said You did not check the neck. I checked. -But it did not open. - No need. I read your report. during the night. What you write indicates displacement of the cervical vertebrae. He had nausea, weakness and ptosis a week ago. The laboratory confirmed the botulism. But it does not mean which was the cause of death. What if he fractured his neck no accident How was the beat? I do not remember very well. He was dizzy as he sat down. "The exam would show. -Not. If it is in the first vertebrae, there is only difficulty to move. Why did not you tell me yesterday? I would have checked better. I do not want to blame you. Everyone who causes an accident Do you seek the body to speak what you have done? I did what I always do. We do not check these things. in a general autopsy. "It was an accident." "And how would I know?" You never talk when you need it. Never had a hard time to tell something Yes? Hello. It's me. For what? MS. Bad luck, I already talked to your sister. I did what I could to help. I'm not busy. I have no time. You're welcome. Goodbye. He sat in the car. He ran his hand over his head, but I did not even call. You are not sure. Keep blaming yourself It will not change anything. He may have died. because of the accident I know. But what can you do now? He was not going to spend ten days. I would live only three more days. "I wish I had spoken to them yesterday." -About what? It's just a possibility. And he would not let you go. I do not want to justify anything, but now it's over. Get up. Let's be late. I can not go. Go you. The key is there. Would you like something to eat? Can not go. -May I help? -I want to talk to Habib. -May I help? - Where's Habib? -In the courtyard. -I looked, he was not there. Look in the locker room. May I help? What is it? What are you doing? Come on! -I'll kill you! -What is it? Leave me! I'll kill you, bastard. What is your problem, you animal?

The forensic laboratory it only tells the cause of death. "And is it good to mention it?" - Depends on the judge. Crime has to be proven. As? He sold it to my husband. No use, you need evidence. What can I do? Do you have a witness? Did anyone see you selling it? I do not know. If you prove, the sentence of your husband can change. I've been living with him for fifteen years. He would not hurt a fly. I know, but it's a criminal process now. What would do if she went with her son? What are you saying? -Hello. -Wait. Need to talk to you! What are you talking about? You can not do what you want. because it was wronged. And what can I do? I come here all the time, I have a small child. Talk to a lawyer.

LEGAL MEDICAL INSTITUTE -Hello. -Hello. -What she wanted? - Did you see her at the gate? IS. I wanted us to change the report. Because? Just a minute. Yes? No, I'm in my office. I'll go there. It's all right. As well? I wanted us to write the cause of death clearly. Hello? Tell Sahragard to bring it. Did not quite understand. Tell me which she said exactly. I'm speaking. She wants us to mention that the spoiled meat was chicken. Chicken meat? Looks like Dad bought it. spoiled chicken meat. They were selling very cheap, and he bought it. - He bought chicken carcass? -I think so. Put it there. Why does she want this? On the report? The judge advised. They'll bring more chips today. -These files are temporary. -Yes, I'll put it upside down. And then? She was very annoyed. I did not get it. There's not enough room. I'll put it on the shelf. Give me the chips. You can go, please. Dr. Salehi said ... -Please, leave. You can come back when we're done. - It does not have to be that thick! "Tell me what she said." "You're letting it go too far. -Answer. What she said? That her husband went after of the chicken salesman. AND? Hit him and now he's in a coma. Who's in a coma? The seller. And the father is where? Is arrested. Kaveh! Kaveh! Kaveh! Kaveh Nariman. From where? IML. Judge Ahmadi authorized the visit. Just a minute. Your cell phone or gun. Hello. Were you at IML that day? Was. Why did not you tell me? I still did not know. Still do not know. I have doubts. If I had doubts, I would not be here. Is not true. He... He had botulism. But the symptoms seem of neck fracture. He broke his neck. and walked out normally? No, it's a medical term. When the trauma is severe, a slight displacement of the vertebra can cause death. Do not understand. You write whatever you want. The blood test confirmed botulism. Then why are you here? Because the cause of death may be another. And you just say now? Wrote that my son died because of the meat I bought. You're done with my life. My wife You can not look at me. Do you know what this is? It's just a possibility. Then why did not you say it before? I did not do the autopsy. It was a colleague. Why did not you do anything? When did you find out? Because? I do not know. I thought a lot. I wrote an exhumation request, but I did not deliver. I was afraid? - I was not sure. "Did you think they were going to fire you?" It's too late. It's too late, doctor. Why did not you take him? to the hospital that night? I buzzed, signaled, But you went straight. Want your money back? It's not about the money. If he had taken the boy, he could have Why did not you stop? He... He was fine. We went out for dinner, after years. If I had taken My son to the hospital, would he have survived? I do not know. I really do not know. Doctor, Do you want me to continue later? No, make yourself comfortable. No longer need me? No thank you. Cut his nails tomorrow. Leave it to me. Goodbye. Take care. -What's Dr. Salehi talking about? -What? -Get out of the car. -Speak. Skirt. What's it? - He said you asked for an exhumation. - Yeah, I asked. What are you doing? In such cases, an autopsy must be performed. What will this change? Suppose he died because of the accident -Is not true. "How do you know that?" You did not check the neck. It was your fault, not mine. Everybody confesses when does it cause an accident? You only know how to repeat that. He had no accident wounds. And the signs of intoxication were clear. You should have said, but you did not say anything! -I will, dammit! -You do not need to exalt yourself. I messed up and I'm paying for it. He would have died anyway. Dad's going crazy! He thinks he killed his own son. Suppose that he did not have botulism ... Why did not he take him? to the doctor? Not a reason for a false report. Did I make a fake report? Are you sure that he died of botulism? -He had botulism. "Was that the cause of death?" -Many people... -Are you sure? I killed him! The son died, he is imprisoned, and the other is in a coma! If I had spoken before, He would not have hit his face! "And I'm to blame for everything?" -Why do not you understand? I would understand if it made any difference. He is ignorant. But we wrote on paper that he killed his own son. If you do not work here, Would you go after him? I made an accident, and he showed up here the next day. What does that mean? Anything. Are you a doctor. Does not make sense. This is the only center. All bodies come here. -Listen to me. -No, listen to me. All right, do the exhumation. But if the result is the same, it will only have caused more suffering. I'm from IML. Park here. He came from there. I was here and I called him. Did you go talk to Habib? He ran away, and I followed him. Show. Come here, soldier! Can go. Stop right there. I got it over here. and I pressed his forehead. Forehead or tem- poral? I hit it right here, like this. - Where's the guard? -I'm here. -Where were you? - At the kiosk. I heard and I saw them fighting. He screamed for me to call the police. What happened next? His shirt was torn. And then he hit me with his head. Show. He pushed me to the wall and took my neck. You see? Yes, I've seen it all. while calling the police. And then? He grabbed my throat. Grab it! With both hands, strangling me. He was strangling me, I had a hand here. Let me lift them up. I wanted to take his hand off him, I turned him around, and he fell here. It was so. Did you push or did he fall? I just wanted to let go. -What you saw? - I was leaving, I did not see it right. Who was the other witness? -Sr. Hesari. -It's me. What you saw? I was going to the warehouse and I saw the two fighting. Where is? At that big gate over there. And then? They were fighting, and he threw it in there. Did he play, or did the other one fall? I saw him playing. Why are you lying? How did you see it so far? - Silence, ma'am. -Is not fair! -Mrs... -He is lying! - Calm down. -You can only speak when I ask. How did he get to see? Take her away. Listen. They are friends. -You should not be here. -Why not? The law will not allow it. I told you not to say anything. -It's all right. I'll be quiet. -Do not leave! Just listen to me for a minute! Do not say anything. Just leave. You will be punished for it! Quiet! Skirt! You're gonna pay for it. You'll pay for all this. Skirt. -Get closer. -Yes sir. Did he fall or was he thrown? I swear it was played. I think you played! Habib is not my friend. Is that what he said? This what? He says you threw him. I already said and I will repeat: he was hanging me. I pushed him, and he fell. "What else do you want to hear?" -Slowly. "Is this door always open?" -Often. We left open to get the smell of diesel. Where did it fall exactly? I have not seen. -Speak louder. -I have not seen. - How could you not? -What do you want me to say? I held him Until the police arrive. "Answer what I asked. -I am not going to answer. Do not complicate matters. "Why were you so rude to my wife?" - I was not thick, she could not be here. Everything I said does not make sense?
