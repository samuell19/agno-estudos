[sneezes] [brakes squealing] OK, kid, out loud now, so as I can hear what you're sayin'. I'm checkin' the passengers, getting on and off. - Uh-huh. - Front and back. Shuttin' the doors. Rear section first. Then the front section. And the doors are closed. Now I'm checkin' indicator lights to make sure the doors are locked. I remove my switch key, go back out the window for a distance of three car lengths - to make sure no one's bein' dragged. - [indistinct chatter] 51st Street next stop. Next stop, 51st Street. How'd I do? [sneezes] [indistinct chatter] [children laughing] Now you take my advice, kid. You serve your six months, and then you put in for the motorman. Watch it now, we're comin' in. - 59th Street. - No, it ain't. [Man over PA] 51st Street. Sorry, this station is 51st Street. [Man 2] Never say you're sorry, kid. Someone may come back here and hit you in your damn nose! Grand Central Station next stop. Next stop, Grand Central. Yeah if I was you I'd start studyin' for that motorman exam right now. Tell you the truth, Mr. Mattson, I have been. Wanna hear some? Every car in the IRT is 72 feet long. Costs $150,000, weighs 75,000lbs. This is where I be getting off. Hang in there kid, you're doin' fine. Yeah, I'll see ya. Hey, what's the rush, chief? We ain't gonna leave without ya! [Man] 33rd Street next stop. Next stop is 33rd. [shrieks] [footsteps approaching] What's wrong, dude? Ain't you never seen a sunset before? Hey! How am I supposed to see with you...? - Holy God! What do you want? - I'm taking your train. You're takin' my train? Hey! Turn around. I got s-s-somethin' to show ya. - What's goin' on? - Shut up! I won't tell you again. Open the door or I'll blow your head off. May I get by, please? No, you don't wanna go in there. Suppose I do anyway? Then I'll shoot your pee-pee off. Now just go back out the window and tell me what you see. Someone leanin' against the head car. The second he comes aboard, you sh-sh-shut the doors. Keep your hand off the microphone, buddy. - All right, Mr. Green? - 100 percent, Mr. Blue. Get moving, will you? [children chattering] [tapping] Oh! Shelley, give that to the meathead upstairs, will ya? [Woman] Right this way. Just follow me. Shelley, have you seen Lieutenant Garber? Oh! Lieutenant, it's so nice of you to leave your duties long enough to escort our distinguished guests around the facilities. - May I present to you Mr. Yashimura. - [exchange greetings] Mr. Matsumoto. Mr. Tomashita. And Mr. Naka... Nakabashi? Uh, these gentlemen are all directors of the Tokyo Metropolitan Subway System. And gentlemen, I'd like you to meet Lieutenant Zachary Garber of our own New York Transit Authority Police. A pleasure, gentlemen. Listen when you're finished with them, send them up to 13. The chairman would like to say goodbye to them personally, OK? - Sayonara! - [foreign language] Follow me, gentlemen. New York City Subway system is the largest in the world, with 237 miles of track, 7,000... Gentlemen, please. New York City Subway system is the largest in the world. 7,000 cars, 237 miles of track... - Say "when", Mr. Blue. - You just keep going, will you? You're still in switchin'. Why don't you peg it up? You're green all the way. We're in no hurry. [sneezes] Your cold sounds pretty bad. I know, Iwoke up in the middle of the night with it. - What happened? - Must've bucked. You told me you could drive this thing. It wasn't me, it's the train. She bucks all the time. She's a dog. This is the headquarters of the Transit Police, which occupies the entire second floor of this building. We call it the nerve center. Right over here, the status board pinpoints the disposition of every Transit Authority patrolman presently in the field. That's it. Get a good shot of that. Things are usually jumpin' pretty good in here. I suppose you gentlemen have your share of crime in the Tokyo subways, right? Right? Well, that's the way it goes. These are the assignment desks. One for each of the lines: the BMT, the IRT, here's the IND. There's our artist in residence. And right through here is our operations lieutenant, Mr. Rico Patrone, who, on weekends, works for the Mafia. Rico, I'd like you to meet some good friends of the chairman. - [Rico] Hiya. - Very good friends, Rico. Hiya. Rico, these are the directors of the Tokyo subway. Why don't you tell these gentlemen about some of the exciting things that have happened in the New York City Subway System lately, Rico. Well, we had a bomb scare in the Bronx yesterday. But it turned out to be a cantaloupe. I'm busy, Zach, OK? In the course of a normal work week, the average TA policeman deals with such crimes as robbery, assault, murder, drunkenness, illness, vandalism, mishegaas, abusiveness, sexual molestation, exhibitionism... - [Green] What's your name, motorman? - Denny Doyle, sir. - Ever been written up? - Yes, sir. Once. - What for? - Runnin' a red signal. How about you? Twice. Once on the Canarsie... That's right, Mr. Green. Tell Mr. Doyle all about yourself, will you? OK. Stop it about here. I'm takin' your brake handle and the reverse key, Denny. [sneezes] I want your cuttin' key also. That's it. You'll be hearing from Command Center in a minute or two. You won't answer, you will ignore the call. Is that perfectly clear, Mr. Doyle? Yes, sir. They can call all they want to, I'm deaf. - Thanks, Mr. Grey. - Don't mention it, Mr. Green, right? Right. Let's have your cab key, conductor. I can't do that. I ain't supposed to do that. You got three seconds to live, conductor. One, two... OK, OK, OK. It'll mean my job. What's he gonna do? You wouldn't want me to spoil the s-s-surprise, would you? Until then, stay where you are. Go back to normal speed when... Command Center callin' Pelham One Two Three. Come in, please. Sorry, I couldn't help it. It was automatic. [Man] Pelham One Two Three, do you read me? Come in, Pelham One Two Three. Pelham One Two Three, where the fuck are you? Hey! What's the goddamn hurry? I told you, one of my men dropped his wedding ring down the john! - What are you runnin' for? - Who's runnin'? - How come that gate ain't locked? - Who's gonna steal a subway train? [Woman] Grand Central Tower callin' Command Center. Have you picked up on Pelham One Two Three yet? [Man] Keep your shirt on. That's what we're tryin' to find out. - What'd he say? - They're backed up all along the line. Jesus Christ, Caz, you picked a hell of a day to be late! You wanted a plumber down here, didn't ya? - Whose goddamn wedding ring was it? - Who else. Mrs. Jenkins'. But, Caz... Sorry about that, Mr. Dolowicz. It just slipped off. - What were you doin' with your hand in the john, anyway? - My hand wasn't... Go fish it out, would ya? The toilet's behind the board. Look Caz, will you listen to me! There's a train down! Classification's been open to a woman for only a month and already we're in a goddamn toilet! - What the hell's that? - That's what Marino's been tryin' to tell ya. He's layin' down between 28th and 23rd. - What the hell for? How long? - A couple, three minutes. Command Center's been tryin' to raise him, but so far he don't answer his phone. Jeez, Caz, why don't he answer his radio? Maybe his radio's busted and the son of a bitch is too lazy to climb down and use the telephone. I'm gonna write him up for this, g'damnit! I'm gonna have his ass! [Man] Hey, it's movin'. For Jesus Christ's sake, the dumb bastard is movin' backwards. Look. He left the front car behind. The goddamn board must be busted. [brakes grinding] He stopped again. Well, stopped is better than backwards at least. Jesus christ, what was that? I didn't know these things went backwards. Now you know. Would you mind tellin' me what you gentlemen are doing? Yeah, I would. [children laughing] [Man] Come in, Pelham One Two Three. Come in. - All right, Mr. Green? - Smooth as silk, Mr. Blue. - How do you feel? - Oh, great. Get out, Doyle. Here's your gun. Get going will ya. We're already two minutes late. [Man] Pelham One Two Three. Do you hear me, Pelham One Two Three? Hey, look. The front car's movin'. And forward this time. - Yeah, yeah. I've got eyes, haven't I? - What's goin' on down there? Are you children with anybody? You children... you with anybody? Yeah. My mother. Go back and join her. - Why? - Go back and join your mother. - Mom, we wanna play. - [indistinct chatter] [gasps] Your attention, please. Now then, you'll all remain seated. Anybody who tries to rise is going to get shot. - [laughing] - [chatter resumes] [gasps] There's another one! Shut up! Move up a bit, Mr. Doyle. Now, ladies and gentlemen, you see this gun? It fires 750 rounds of 9-millimeter ammunition per minute. In other words, if all of you simultaneously were to rush me, not a single one of you would get any closer than you are right now. - Hey Ma, are those real guns? - Shh! I do hope I have made myself understood. [Spanish] [chattering in Spanish] [brakes squealing] He stopped again. The crazy dumb-ass son of a bitch stopped again. He's halfway between stations! What the hell is...? Pure mental case. I'm gonna nail his pecker to the goddamn wall for this. - Caz, take it easy, will ya? - [Caz] Oh, come on! If I gotta watch my language just because they let a few broads in, I'm gonna quit! How the hell can you run a goddamn railroad without swearin'?! Grand Central Terminal, this is the desk train master. Who the hell's in charge down there? It's for you, Mr. Dolowicz. It's me, Frank. Caz Dolowicz. We're watchin' it on the board. What the hell good is watchin' it?! I got trains pilin' up behind it! - Get some supervision down there! - it's on its way, Frank. I'll be back. - I've turned off the power. - [indistinct muttering] All right, everybody in this part of the car, move to the back. Come on. Everybody in the front part of the car move to the back. - What the hell is goin' on? - Move back, please, and sit down. - [confused chatter] - [Woman] May I say something, please? You mind letting us know what's happening here? - Please, listen to me... - Be quiet and sit down! - Let's go, honey. - Don't touch... All right, Mr. Doyle. What are you gonna do? - What about this one? - Let her sleep. [Blue] What you're going to do, Mr. Doyle, is to go back, collect all the passengers from the 9 cars we've cut loose, and walk them to the 28th Street station. - I don't know sir, people hate to get off in a tunnel... - Just do as you're told. Excuse me. Excuse me. Can I go with him? I got this very important appointment to see. Nobody else leaves. Aw, shit. I'm sure you wouldn't mind if the children were to go. Sit down, madam. Didn't you hear what I said? I said nobody else leaves. Excuse me, mister. Don't you think we should be let in on what's happening? What's happening, sir, is that you're being held by four very dangerous men armed with machine guns. - I suppose you asked a foolish question... - [cries of dismay] Be quiet. Be quiet! Nothing will happen as long as you obey my orders. Shit, man. That's what they said in Vietnam, and I still got my ass shot full of lead. - Shut your mouth, nigger! - [grunts] [Woman gasps] - And keep it shut. - Mr. Grey! [Woman praying in Spanish] It's terrible. Who asked you to look? [Blue] All right, Mr. Green? The power's off from 14th Street to 33rd. All four tracks. Local and express. The north and the southbound. Why am I still seeing these lights in this tunnel? Well that's emergency. They run on AC like the signals. [sneezes] - Stop that, will you? - Sorry. - Leave the door open. - [Caz] Command Center calling Pelham. Did you cut off the power down there? Without callin' Power to explain? Huh? Now you listen to me One Two Three. Cut this out and answer me. You're screwing up the whole New York City Subway System. [Garber] Gentlemen, this is the TA Command Center, come on in. A lot of laughs in here. Terrific place. You see, each train is identified by the name of its terminus and the time of its departure. Thus an express train leavin' Woodlawn at 6:30pm would be Woodlawn 6-3-0. While on its return trip its destination might be, uh... let's say, like, Flatbush 8-2-5. I hope you're memorizin' all this junk. I'm gonna ask questions later. Garber, what the hell's the matter with you? Don't worry about a thing. They don't understand a word of English. This way, dummies. You step this way, dummies. Over here is Frank Correll, the Lord Byron of the New York City Subway System. Observe the way fire and smoke shoot out of his ears. Don't bug me, Garber. I got troubles here. What's the matter? A train is down, its radio's dead, the power's off, and it's dumped its load. Aside from that, everything's ginger-peachy. What time is it, Mr. Green? Uh... 2:10. Right. Time to talk to them. - Is something troubling you? - I think I'm gonna die today. That's entirely possible. This is Pelham One Two Three to Command Center. This is Pelham One Two Three to Command Center. Do you read me? OK, we'll leave him alone to his problems. Where the hell have you been? What are you tryin' to do? Screw up this entire railroad single-handedly? I want an explanation and it better be good! Your train has been taken. - What? - Repeat, your train has been taken. Hey, shut up in here! Shut up! I said shut it, everybody! Shut it up, everybody, goddamnit! Pelham One Two Three, what do you mean the train has been taken? - Are you the motorman? - [Blue] Negative. Then who are you? Nobody's to be in that cab except the lousy motorman. Now identify yourself. Listen, Train Master, Your locomotive has been hijacked by a group of heavily armed men. It what? We are holding 17 passengers and the conductor hostage in the first car. I am quite prepared to kill any or all of them if you do not obey my commands to the letter. - Have I made myself quite clear? - You're outta your skull! Be that as it may, get out a pen, take down our list of demands. Hey, now wait a minute. Hold on. Stand by. Why would anybody wanna hijack a goddamn subway train for? Hit your six button, will ya Frank. I want the TA police in on this. What hell are all these Chinamen doin' in here eh? [Garber] Holy Christ, I forgot. Charlie, would you take these monkeys up to 13. It is all right, Lieutenant Garber. I am sure we can find it by ourselves. And thank you for a most instructive visit, Lieutenant. A most exciting tour, Lieutenant. Most exciting. Most exciting. Garber to Patrone. Garber to Patrone. Come in, Patrone. This is Patrone. Rico, I want you to plug everythin' you got into the IRT train master's circuit, will ya? And all units stand by on the double. Call in the City cops. Put it on a 911 so their computer gets it. What's up, Z? - You won't believe it. - You know me, I'll believe anythin'. A train's been hijacked. I don't believe it. [exasperated chatter] When did the power go? - Hey! Conductor, when did the power go? - [Man] Who wants to know? Me! The supervisor of the Grand Central Tower wants to know! Oh, yes, sir! A couple of minutes ago! Hey, what happened down there man? Who wants to know! No, nobody's hurt! - [Man] What's goin' on? - I don't know what's goin' on! - What happened? - Nothin' happened, lady. - Was anybody killed? - No. Nobody's killed. [Man] On the left now, watch out for the third rail. On the left now. What the hell is this, for Christ's sake? Your attention, please, ladies and gentlemen. I'm sure the more intelligent of you have worked out you're all hostages. - Oh, my God! - [nervous chatter] Isn't that wonderful. - Hostages. - What did you think? Guests? When we get what we want, you'll all be released unharmed. Until then, you'll continue to do precisely as you're told. [Spanish] Excuse me, sir. What's going to happen to us if you don't get what you want? Excuse me, sir. We are going to get what we want. [Caz] I don't give a goddamn what they were armed with. They were gonna kill me! You're like the captain of the ship! You're supposed to go down with it! - [Woman] Horseshit! - Oh, lady, butt out! Tell Command Center I'll be on my way to investigate! [Denny] I wouldn't go down there if I was you! I know you wouldn't! You work for the subway, mister? Tell 'em I'm gonna sue! I'm gonna sue their ass off! [Shouting] Pelham One Two Three to Command Center. Do you read me? Are you ready to take down our list of demands now? I'm listening, you animal. What do you want? - Do you have your pen? - Go on, for Pete's sake! To begin with, it's important you understand three things. One, Pelham One Two Three is completely within our control. Two, we are all armed with automatic weapons. Three, we have no scruples whatsoever about killing. - Do you understand me so far? - Oh I understand you fine, you lunatic. You'll never get away with this. Please inform the Mayor that we demand one million dollars cash for the release of the car and all the hostages, right? - That'll be the day. - The time is now 2:13. The money must be in our hands not later than 3:13. One hour from now. Now if the money is not in our hands, we'll kill one hostage for every minute you're late. Keep dreamin', maniac. Furthermore, if anybody attempts to interfere - anyone, in any way - we will begin killing the hostages immediately. Confirm, please. Zach! Zach! - Pelham One Two Three, come in, please. - [Blue] This is Pelham. Identify yourself, please. This is Lieutenant Zachary Garber of the Transit Police. Identify yourself, please. I'm the man who stole your train. Sir, there is no way you can get away with this. You are underground in a tunnel. Why do you concern yourself with that? At precisely 3:13 we are going to begin executing the hostages. Don't you'd better get in touch with the Mayor and get back to me for my further instructions. Over and out. That son of a bitch has got me backed up all the way to the Bronx! Alright what is this, a circus? C'mon! Let's get back to work! Rico, did you get that? I only got your end of it, but I could piece the rest of it together. It's crazy! Well the guy who's talking has got a heavy English accent. He could be a fruitcake. We got anybody at 28th Street? Just checkin' that. Yeah, he's around there somewhere. Tell him to hold the fort. It's liable to be all day before the City cops show up. They're never around when you need 'em. - Will do, Z. [All shouting] [Rico] Lex 28. Lex 28. Come in, please. Patrolman James. This is Lieutenant Patrone, Operations. Where are you? 28th Street, southbound. Hey look, Lieutenant, everything's cooled out. I mean nothing's happening. What's goin' on? Look, don't react to this, but a train's been hijacked. - Holy shit. - For God's sake, don't say anything. Oh, there's a supervisor from Grand Central Tower missing. Yeah, I saw him a few minutes ago. He went down the track on foot. Look, you better go after him. See if you can turn him back. Yes, sir. [Mayor] All I know is I am the goddamn Mayor of the goddamn city of New York, the second most important elective office in the entire country, and you're trying to tell me I gotta lay here and suffer like every other schlub in the country? I'm sorry you have the flu, Mr. Mayor. There's nothing more I can do. There's one more thing. Get out! You can't fight City Hall. [Man on TV] Couple number two, Arthur and Eleanor you have 20 points. [Phone rings] ...correctly and you'll move into first place. - [TV turns off] - Yeah? [Man] Hello Al, it's Warren. I'm comin' upstairs. I got a real bitch on our hands. Don't tell me. I don't wanna know. - I'm comin' up. - Can't you handle it, Warren? You are the goddamn Deputy Mayor of the city of... Sure I can handle it. Like I handle every other filthy, stinkin' job in this whole miserable city, but I'm not gonna do it. What is it? Another strike? All right, all right. I can take another strike. A gang of men has hijacked a subway train. A gang of men has...? Has hijacked a subway train. They want a million dollars for it. Come on up. [Man on TV] Couple number one... are the winners of today's Newlywed Game! Missed it! What do you want, Mr. Green? Is everythin' OK? Go back and sit down. I do not want Mr. Grey and Mr. Brown alone with the passengers. - Why don't you trust them? - Yes, I trust Mr. Brown. I do not trust Mr. Grey. I think that Mr. Grey is an enormous arrogant pain in the arse who could turn out to be trouble. I also think that he is mad. Why do you think they threw him out of the Mafia? Ohh... terrific. [Whistles] Hold it right there, cowboy! [Caz] Who are you?! [Mr. Grey] You'll find out if you take another step! I'm warnin' ya, mister! That's City property you're foolin' around with! That's just too fuckin' bad! Why don't you go grab a goddamn aeroplane like everybody else? 'Cause we're afraid of flyin'! Now I'm tellin' ya, clear out or I'll shoot your ass off! The hell with you! I'm comin' on board! I warned you, stupid! [Hostages screaming] Holy shit. [screaming continues] I warned the bastard, but he kept on comin' anyway. - Was he alone? - I didn't see nobody else. - [children crying] - Mr. Brown. I guess I got us on the scoreboard, right? [chuckles] [screams, chatter continues] Take over from Mr. Grey. - A little quick with that gun. - The jerk was comin' on board, what are...!? - Loved every minute of it. - [children crying] - Keep those children quiet. - [Woman] I'm trying! I can't! - Do you want me to try? - Oh, my God! No! Thought you said that nobody was gonna get hurt. [Whispering] Patrolman James callin' Operations. This is Patrone. Did you find that supervisor? - Shh! - [Turns radio down] - He's dead, Lieutenant. - Speak up, will ya? I can't hear ya. I can't. I'm only 20 yards away from the hijacked train. They just shot him with a machine gun. Is he dead? - Wouldn't you be, Lieutenant? - Alright stay put and keep an eye on things. Z! They just drew first blood. That supervisor from Grand Central Tower. Don't know his name, they just killed him. Oh, my God. Thanks, Rico. Frank, do you know who went to 28th from Grand Central? - Yeah, Caz Dolowicz. Why? - Jeez. I knew him. Hey, whaddaya mean, you knew him? [Garber] They just shot him. Dead? - Caz? Fat Caz? - Yeah. - [Man] Garber? - Aw, shit! Garber? Are you there, Zach? - Yeah, who is this? - Costello. Yes, Captain. I'm puttin' you in charge at this end. I'm goin' down to headquarters. If I don't show up quick, the city cops'll hog all the action. There's even one on board the train. One of the hostages. You're kiddin'. There's a cop on the train? How do you know? There were two, but one got off at 33rd and called in later when the news got out. That means the other one's still on the train. - Plainclothes? - Yeah, Tactical Force. - Man or woman? - Know something, I never even thought to ask. Well, doesn't make any difference. Whoever it is can't do very much single-handed. [Al] Warren, I thought it over. I know what we're gonna do. Tell me. We're gonna let 'em keep the goddamn subway train. Hell! We got plenty of them. We'll never even miss it. How about the 18 hostages, Al? We gonna miss them? Warren, goddamnit! This city hasn't got a million dollars! Well you better empty out one of your Swiss bank accounts, because there's no other way out. - Don't we get to think about it? - There's no time. I still want the full picture. Get me the police commissioner, the chairman of the Transit Authority, and that putz we got for a controller. They're on their way over now, but it's no good runnin' to them, Al. You're the Mayor. The buck stops with you. - Oh, shit. - God help us. Shit! Piss! Fuck! Mike, call Charlie please. Tell him I'll get to him as soon as I can. Hey Tom, where's that list on 144? Command Center callin' Pelham One Two Three. Hey Frank, you're hoggin' all my circuits! What do you want from me? I got motormen callin' me from all over the line! Tell 'em to shut up and get off the air! I need some more lines open here. Never thought I'd see the day where talkin' to murderers took priority over runnin' a railroad? Get off it. My only priority is savin' the lives of these passengers. Screw the goddamn passengers! What the hell do they expect for lousy 35 cents? To live forever?! Oh, you're beautiful. - Do you read me, Pelham One Two Three? - If I was runnin' things I'd go in there with guns and teargas... Yeah well you're not runnin' things so why don't you start doin' your own work and let the police do theirs? Like that livid cop on the train. When the hell's he gonna start shootin'? We don't know if it is a "he“. - Do you read me, Pelham One Two Three? - Women cops! What the hell good are they? Probably can't find her gun in her goddamn purse! [Man] Pelham One Two Three. Any news to report? What's that about news? Say again about news. I said have you any news to report? - No, nothin' yet. - [sneezes] Gesundheit! - What are you calling about? - Pelham, we need more time. Shut the door, please. It is 2:24, Lieutenant. You've got 49 minutes left. Be reasonable, will ya? We're tryin' to cooperate with ya, but we can't do anything if you don't give us enough time to work with. [Blue] 49 minutes. We're dealin' with City Hall for God's sake. You know what a mess of red tape that is? 49 minutes. Look, fella, we know how to tell time here as well as you do, but we aren't gonna get any place if all you do is repeat "49 minutes!" 48 minutes. Yeah, all right, all right. We'll get back to you as soon as we can. Christ, to hear you plead with that chickenshit makes me ashamed to be an American! Will ya, Frank. Go play with your trains. [siren wailing] [Man on radio] Stay tuned for an update on the subway hijacking case. - [soft music] This is the Police Commisioner, get me the Borough Commander. - Turn off that goddamn music, will ya. - Yes, sir. Harry? I'm headin' up to see the Mayor right now. What's it look like down there? It's murder, Phil, as usual, comin' out of the woodwork. They really smell blood on this one. - Who's your number two? - Deputy Chief Inspector Daniels, from Spec Ops. He's a good man, Phil. He handled that protest at Bryant Park last month. - Get those goddamn photographers outta here! - How are you deployed? I've got about fifty men inside the tunnel, north and south of the train, well concealed, all wearing vests and armed with machine guns, shotguns, handguns, riot guns and a half-dozen snipers with night scopes. We could fight the Third World War down there! Well, just make sure they stay outta sight! If the hijackers see 'em, we'll have a massacre on our hands. We have a sniper's report that they're movin' around inside the car pretty freely. The one in the motorman's cab is fully exposed and an easy shot. No! Absolutely no! Understand me Harry? We're takin' the threat seriously! What's upstairs? Trucks, cars, emergency medical and rescue units. The works, Phil. Harry... tell me somethin', will ya? They're in a tunnel, surrounded on all sides. Now, how do they expect to get away? Beats the shit out of me, Phil. [Al blowing his nose] [Woman] Oh, Al, it's disgusting. Would you stop it with the tissue? Warren, would you tell him that other Mayors have to live in this house after we're gone. Go on in there, Al, and I'll send everybody in. Just sit down. Oh good. Thanks for comin' up on such short notice, fellas. - You all know Jessie, don't you? - [Greetings exchanged] Good, Phil, just in time. - Hello Phil. Coffee? How about some cake? Better skip it, Jessie. We're running a little short on time. We all know what's goin' on underground, don't we? So the issue is whether or not we're gonna pay the ransom. Phil? Whaddaya think? We're fully mobilized. I can go down there any time you say, there's enough firepower to wipe out an army. But... I can't guarantee the safety of the hostages. In other words, you're for payin' the ransom. Well, we don't want another Attica, do we? - [Warren] So your vote is? - I abstain. Shit. Barney? The safety of the passengers is the only concern of the Transit Authority. - Your vote? - Pay the two dollars. If it was two dollars, I'd pay the two dollars, Barney! It's a million! It's a one with six zeros! Now tell me, is it comin' outta your pocket? Come on, Sid, will ya save the poor mouth for later? How do you vote? - I'm not through discussin' it yet. - [Warren] Yes, you are. Now vote. My concern is with the taxpayers. You know what I always say, "millions for defense but not one cent for tribute." - Isn't that what I always say? - Uh-huh. So that's a “no"... All right, Al. You've heard from the Three Wise Men. - Now what do you say? - What are they goin' to say, Warren? - They who? - Who? Everybody! - The press! The man on the street! - He means the voters. - [coughing] - You know what they're gonna say. The Times will support you, The News is gonna knock you. The Post will take both sides at the same time. The rich'll support you. Likewise the blacks. The Puerto Ricans won't give a shit. So c'mon, Al, quit stalling! You stop bullyin' everybody, Warren! This is supposed to be a democracy! Wise up, for Christ sake! We're tryin' to run a city, not a goddamn democracy! Al, quit fartin' around! We've gotta pay! - Jessie? - Hmm? Jessie, what do you say? I know a million dollars sounds like a lot of money. But just think what you're gonna get in return. - What? - 18 sure votes. All right. All right. Warren? - Warren, arrange for the payoff. - Hallelujah. Alright fellas. You heard him. Phil, pass the word to the bad guys that we're coughing up. - Sid, what bank do we do the most business with? - City National Trust. I'll give 'em a call. I'll call. You'll take an hour tryin' to knock down the interest rate. [exhales] Jessie? I think I handled it all right. A regular Fiorello La Guardia. [James whispering] Patrolman James callin' Operations. [Rico] This is Patrone. What's going on? Lieutenant, there's a lot of feet movin' around out there in the dark. I can hear 'em. I figure it's a couple of dozen sharpshooters and snipers. - Am I right? - I wouldn't be surprised. Yeah well, you make damn sure they know I'm standin' here between them and the hijackers. I'm not all that easy to see in the dark. [door opens] Nothing yet? Boy! They're sure takin' their time, aren't they? Don't worry. They're gonna have to pay. Suppose they don't? Well, then a lot of people are gonna die, aren't they? Including us. Better than selling life insurance, isn't it? Life insurance? I thought you told me you were in the army. I was. That's where I developed my expensive tastes. British Army. $150 a month. You gotta be kiddin'. The Africans paid me $5,000. - A month? - For leading a battalion. Jesus! What the hell did you get outta that for? Because the market dried up. Wow! 5,000! At least you weren't fired, ya know? But I don't give a shit. What guy wants to drive a subway train for the rest of his life? What did they catch you doing? N... Nothin'. I mean, they framed me. The biggies needed a fall guy. Transit cops. Undercover guys. They got wind of a gang passin' dope. Transporting from downtown to uptown, and givin' it to a motorman, somebody picked it up. They tried to pin the evidence on me, but they didn't find anything. You were innocent? Of course I was innocent. You think I'd do a thing like that? [sirens] Harry, I'm on my way down to headquarters. We got the green light. Green light? Jesus, that's great news. The men are rarin' to go. No, no! We're paying 'em the ransom money. Pass the word along to the hijackers. Roger. Borough Command to the 28th Street platform. Come in, Daniels. - Daniels, do you read me?! - This is Daniels. Pass the word along, the Mayor's agreed to pay. Let the hijackers know right away, will ya? Roger. Command Center, this is 28th Street. Do you read me, Command Center? - This is Command Center. Who is this? - Chief Inspector Daniels. The Mayor's agreed to pay. Pass it on to the hijackers right away. Will do, sir. Pelham One Two Three. Come in, Pelham One Two Three. This is Pelham One Two Three. I read you. We agree to pay the ransom. Repeat, we agree to pay... What? They're gonna do what? Do you read me, Pelham One Two Three? - Zach, you're outta your skull. - Hey, will ya? [Blue] I read you, Garber. Alright, take down my next set of instructions, they're to be followed to the letter. The money's to be paid in the following denominations: $500,000 dollars in fifties. $500,000 dollars in hundreds. Right? 500,000 in fifties. 500,000 in hundreds, right. Which will then be put in stacks of 200 bills each, bound with two thick elastic bands. Two stacks of bills, bound in what? Bound with thick elastic bands. Point two: All of the bills will be old bills, their serial numbers to be random. Now that's all. When the delivery arrives we'll contact you with further instructions, right? - About what? Your getaway? - Signing off now. Son of a bitch! Hey, Pelham. It might interest you to know I figured out how you're gonna do it. Yes, it would interest me very much. You're gonna make every man, woman and child in New York City close their eyes and count to a hundred, right? It is now 2:47. That means you have got 26 minutes... Hey, wait a minute, pal, wait a minute! We agreed to pay the money. Now turn your clock off will ya?! - 26 minutes. - Look pal, your instructions were complicated. The money has to be counted, stacked, tied, transported uptown. It just isn't physically possible. You'd be surprised what's physically possible. The clock's running. 26 minutes. After that, we can scratching 'em off one per minute. [Blue] Your attention, please! Ladies and gentlemen, it might interest you to know the city of New York has agreed to pay for your release. [cries of delight] As soon as the money gets here, will you let us go? Soon after. Excuse me, sir. Would you mind telling us how much you're getting? Why is that of interest to you, sir? Well, a person likes to know his worth. - One million dollars. - That's not so terrific. [man whimpering] Pull your pants up, Al. We're goin' downtown. Totally out of the question, Mr. LaSalle. Nobody asked you. Warren, for Pete's sake, I'm sick as a goat. What's the point? The point, for Pete's sake, is that the Mayor of the city of New York, trailing by 22 points in all the polls, cares enough about 18 citizens in jeopardy to make a personal appearance in their behalf. You know what'll happen? What always happens. I'll get booed. - He's a very sick man. - Will you let go of that! [groans] Look Al, all you have to do is say a few words to the hijackers over a bullhorn. You make a dignified plea for mercy. Warren, suppose the hijackers start shootin' at me? Will you stop! They have no reason to shoot at you. Why? Do you think they're from outta town? [Al chuckles] Get dressed, Al. I'll do the jokes. [overlapping chatter] - [Frank] Hold your water, will ya? - [Man, indistinct] All right, shut up and I'll tell you what we're gonna do. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Now listen. I want all trains... [Rico] Garber. Come in, Garber. Come in, Garber. - Who are we waitin' for, Z? - Beats me. Listen, how long's it take to get all that money together anyway? We'll never make it. The passengers are dead ducks. - I wonder what that cop's thinkin' about now. - What cop? The one who's a hostage. Shit, I'm glad it's not me. - Where the hell's that money? - Rico, you wanna make yourself useful? Get Personnel and tell 'em to get together a list of all motormen discharged for cause during the past five-ten years. - What are you lookin' for? - Somebody down there knows how to drive a train. You don't pick that up watching Sesame Street. Tell 'em you want it today. Mr. Grey, can I have a word with you, please? Will you stop messing around with that girl, Mr. Grey? What are you talking about? She's a 20-buck-a-trick hooker. - Who's a 20-buck-a-trick hooker? - Leave her alone. Who are you to go around callin' people "2-buck-a-trick hooker?" I can do this job and hump that broad at the same time. Listen, you little prick! 20 bucks wouldn't buy you a good-night kiss! I'm giving you an order, Mr. Grey. Blow it outta your ass, Colonel. You're talkin' to the wrong man. I'm not your Mr. B-B-B-Brown. I once had a man shot for talking to me like that. Well, that's the difference between us. I've always done my own killin'. Sure takin' a hell of a long time in there. It's a lot of money, Albert. Ever stop to think how many times you gotta wet your thumb to count a million bucks? Command Center calling 28th Street. Come in, Inspector. This is Daniels. - Has the money left yet, Inspector? - Not yet. What are they waitin' for, Inspector? For God's sake, give 'em a goose, will ya? We're runnin' outta time! We're runnin' outta time! [Mr. Grey whistling] [Garber] Pelham One Two Three, this is Command Center. Come in, Pelham One Two Three. - This is Pelham One Two Three. - This is Garber. We're movin' a little slowly at this end, Pelham. We need some more time. Sorry, no more time. Well look, if you can just see your way... - Will you hold it down, Frank? - I want a local sent around the loop at South Ferry and shot up the West Side... I said knock it off! I'm tryin' to buy some time here! And I'm tryin' to run a railroad, for christ's sake! While you're playing grab-ass with a bunch of friggin' pirates! How about 15 more minutes, Pelham? A lousy 15 minutes? Negative. Ten minutes, then. What difference can ten minutes make to you? Negative. - Anythin' wrong? - Wanted more time. - How much more? - Just ten minutes. - Guess that can't hurt anybody. - I didn't give it to them. - Suppose they can't make it? - Then we do what we said we'd do. Maybe an hour isn't enough time. You know the system. You give 'em an hour, they take an hour. Give 'em two hours, they take two hours. An hour is plenty of time, Mr. Green. Yeah, but supposin' it isn't? This is the Borough Commander. Come in, Headquarters Charlie! Aren't you guys movin' yet? The hell's goin' on down there?! D'ya know what the damn time is? Well yes sir, we're still waitin' for the money, sir. I'm warning you two guys. If I don't see your faces before the deadline, - I don't wanna see them at all! Ever! - Yes, sir. I told you. it's gonna be our ass. - This is a million dollars? - It's what it buys, Albert. Not what it weighs. [siren] [siren] [overlapping chatter] Eight minutes. We're just not gonna make it. - Inspector, where are they now, please? - Center Street, just north of Chambers. That gives us seven minutes. Just not enough time, sir. Even if they get it up to 28th Street on time, we still gotta carry it down track on foot. No way, sir. [brakes screeching] [Man] I always wanted to do this. Look, we're scarin' the shit outta everybody. Yeah, includin' me. Pelham One Two Three, this is Garber. Come in, Pelham One Two Three. All right, Garber, this is Pelham One Two Three. The money's en route, makin' pretty good time too, but it won't get to you by 3:13. I'm very sorry to hear that. Suppose we get it to the station entrance by then. Will you change your deadline from delivery to you to arrival at 28th Street? Would you do that at least? Do you read me, Pelham, for cryin' out loud? All right, Garber. But no more concessions. - Is that quite clear? - Quite clear. Quite clear. Inspector, they bought it! If we get the money over to the station by 3:13 we'll be OK. Good work, Garber. Headquarters Charlie, headin' north on Center Street... Keep it comin'. You've got four minutes! Yes, sir, we'll make it... We'll never make it. Sir, I just got word, the Mayor is on his way down. Terrific. Tell him we'll hold the crowd till he gets here. [siren] [shouting] Mr. Green. Yes. Coming up in one minute. Have you decided which one it's gonna be? Does that make any difference? I guess not. OK. 50 seconds and then I'm gonna eliminate one. Headquarters Charlie, we're approaching Houston Street, and approaching Astor Place. You've still got 28 blocks! Floor the son of a bitch! - Look out! - [brakes screech] Whaddaya mean, it's been wrecked? There's no more time! We're outta time! I know we're outta time. What do you expect me to do? Couldn't make it, that's all. What d'ya mean that's all? They're about to shoot an innocent person, sir! How can they do that, if they know the truck is wrecked, how can they expect us to be on time? They don't know anythin' down there. How can they know anything... Holy mackerel, that's it. Pelham One Two Three, the money has arrived. Repeat, the money has arrived. Do you read me, Pelham One Two Three? The money has arrived. This is Pelham One Two Three. You made it just in time, didn't you? Get it up there! Move! I hope it works. [siren wails] [Blue] Are you still there, Garber? Still here. Tell me something, Pelham. If we were a couple of seconds late, you mean you would've knocked off an innocent party? Affirmative. Now I'm gonna give you the instructions for the delivery of the money. As usual, you'll follow them to the letter, OK? I got it. Go ahead. - Two unarmed policemen... - [sneezes] Gesundheit. Two unarmed policemen will walk down the track. One with the money, the other with a torch, which he will flash continuously from side to side. When they reach the car the rear door will be opened and the one with the money will throw it onto the floor of the train. Then they will both turn and walk back to 28th Street station. Acknowledge. - I got it. Is that all? - Yeah, that's all for now. But do keep in mind, won't you, that the same ground rules apply. Any wrong move by anyone and I kill a hostage. [Garber] Coulda guessed that part. You have got five minutes to deliver this money. Hey you don't really think you're gonna get out, do ya? It's now 3:14. You've got till 3:19. Over. Over. Bastard. [siren] Well, it's about fuckin' time! You two! C'mon! Get the money outta there! Which one has the flashlight? Alright, then you carry the money. Gimme that paper. Now move it! You've only got four minutes! Nevermind the goddamn salutes! Just get goin'! Get goin'! [crowd boos] Jesus, it's the goddamn Mayor. - You get the feelin' we ain't alone down here? - Whaddaya mean? We got four submachine guns in front of us, and all these jokers behind us. I feel like I'm walkin' into the fuckin' OK Corral. Pow! Shit! - [gunshot] - [screaming] [screaming continues] [gunshots continue] [Man] Hold your fire, goddamnit! - [whimpering] - Quiet! - Are you all right? - Yeah. it's not too b-b-bad. - I think it went right through. - Move back, come on. Move back. Hey! Give me that scarf. Give me that scarf! Keep quiet! - OK? - Yeah. I don't feel p-pain too much. - [Blue] How many shots? - [Brown] Just one. The rest was me and then they answered. I didn't see anybody, I just got mad. Goddamnit! Mr. Grey? You don't think they're finished out there, do ya? Go back there and help Mr. Green, will you, please? Some girl-scout chickenshit outfit I'm in, here. I suppose somebody out there got nervous or bored. Been there a long time. Can't afford to let it pass. [Rico] Who started it? Who fired first? Them or us? I don't know, Lieutenant. It came from somewhere behind me in the dark. It had to be one of the snipers they got down here. Somebody just took it in his head to fire on his own? - How could he do such a thing? - Easy, Lieutenant. Real easy. Can you see what's goin' on inside the train? No, not too good. I'd sure hate to be in there findin' out. Conductor. - You mean me? - Yes I do mean you. Stand up and come down here. - Why, what are you gonna do? - Something you can help me with. - Come on. Come down here. - Look, if he doesn't wanna go... All right, everybody. Just get back on your seats. Very quietly. Come on. Back on your seats. All right, conductor. I want you to walk up track about a hundred feet. Just wait for the men delivering the money, all right? I'll open the door for you. - Why do I have to go? - Come on, come on. - [Blue] Here, I'll help you down. - [door opens] Come on. Please go. There's nothing to worry about. Look! Somebody's climbin' down! Christ, he's comin' this way! - [screaming] - [Woman] Oh, no! [children crying] What? What the hell are you talking about, Rico? Why would they shoot a hostage? We're still under the deadline. - I told ya, somebody threw a shot at them. - Who the hell was it? Nobody knows. My bet is we never will. Z, when are we gonna hear from that cop who's on board? What do you want, Rico? A suicide? There's a bunch of heavily armed men down there. What chance has one lousy cop got, especially if it's a dame? Boy, what a mess! Pelham One Two Three, come in. This is Garber. Here is Pelham One Two Three. Come in, Garber. For Christ's sake, fella, did ya have to do it? One of my men was fired at. I warned you what the penalty would be. - Yeah, you warned me. - [Blue] Where's the money? I'm going to give you 30 seconds more. [children crying] [Man whispering] Hey, you guys! - Christ, who's that? - Transit cop. I got orders for you. Resume delivery on the double. I don't suppose we could have that in writin'? Mr. Blue, we got a light! [Blue] All right. Open the door, would you, Mr. Brown? All right, gentlemen. Hands in evidence, please. Put up your hands! All right. Throw the money up here. Into the cab. Push it up. Thank you. Now turn around. Go home to your wives and children. Keep the hands up. Take it very easily. Shut the door, Mr. Brown, will you? - [Man whistles] - Oh... Mr. Grey. - [Woman] Jesus H. Christ! - [Spanish] I've never seen a million dollars in my life before. You can load up first, Mr. Grey. I'll load up as soon as I talk to Garber. All that money! I can't believe it! I'm gonna die today. Well... either you live or you die. - That's 18 packs each, right? - Right. This is Pelham One Two Three. Do you read me, Garber? - This is Garber. Go ahead. - I'm gonna give you three specific instructions. Each one is to be followed precisely. Is that clear? So far. One: At the end of this conversation, you will restore power to the entire sector. Right. Restore power. Go ahead. Two: You will clear the local track all the way from 28th Street to South Ferry. By clear I mean switches properly set, all signals green. I emphasize green, Garber. If I so much as see a red light, let alone get tripped by one, I'll shoot another hostage. [Blue] You will also remove all police personnel from the tunnel. If I see a single policeman between here and South Ferry, I'll shoot another hostage. In fact, any deviation, I'll shoot another hostage. Listen, fella, I hope you take this in the right spirit, but after this is over you should seek psychiatric help. Let me know when all my points have been complied with. Over and out. - Rico, are you there? - I'm here, Z. What's up? Hold on while I cut in the city cops. Frank, hook me up and get outta there. What a way to run a railroad! - Inspector Daniels, come in. This is Garber. - This is Daniels. Inspector, I have Lieutenant Patrone of the Transit Police on the line. I have the latest instructions from the hijackers. They want power restored, all tracks cleared, signals green to South Ferry, and no cops anywhere in sight. OK, sir, so we go along with that. We have to, we have no choice. But then what? - What do you think they got in mind? - Beats the hell outta me, Z. I wouldn't have picked a tunnel to make my getaway in the first place. But they did pick it. And since so far, everything they've done has been worked out to the smallest detail, it stands to reason they got the rest of this worked out, too. Alright, power restored and track cleared. But why South Ferry? Well, do you think it's the water, Rico? Maybe they got a boat in the harbor... I don't know. We'd better play it one step at a time. Lieutenant Garber, you see about restorin' the power and clearin' the track. I'll start pullin' my units out of the tunnel. We can follow them just as well on the street. Except how do we know where they'll be? Grand Central Tower has 'em on their model board, sir. We can see every move they make. They stop any place before South Ferry, we know about it. I'll check in when I get to my car. [Rico] Wait a minute, I think I just figured out how they're gonna get away. - I'm listenin'. - They're gonna fly the train to Cuba. You're a sick man, Rico. For Christs sake, whaddaya want me to do? The power's still off! You'll have to move 'em by bus! What do you mean you haven't got any buses? Go out and hijack some! Hey, Garber, what's goin' on? Do I get my trains back now or don't I? You don't. Not yet. Do you realize the goddamn rush hour starts in an hour? Will you shut up for a minute and listen? I got a new set of instructions. I don't give a rat's ass to your fuckin' instructions! I'm not liftin' a finger to help the killers of Caz Dolowicz. Hey! Now you listen to me, you dumb son of a bitch. If you don't do what I tell you, you'll be havin' dinner tonight with Caz Dolowicz! Jesus Christ, what are you...! [cries of relief] OK. [Blue] Better take the case out. All right, ladies and gentlemen. Pay attention to me again will you, please. In a little while we hope to be moving again. Then, with a bit of luck, you'll all be released unharmed. Until then, of course, you'll continue to obey my orders. [Blue] Thank you for your cooperation. Hey, dude. As long as you're goin' downtown anyway, you mind droppin' me off at Fulton Street? You're a wise mother, you know that? How'd you like some more? This'll give 'em a jolt, even before they expected it. - [Man] Look at this. - Holy Christ, she's movin'. The hell's goin' on? They promised to wait until we cleared track all the way down. Jenkins, get Command Center. Grand Central Tower, callin' Command Center. - This is Command Center. - She's movin'. - Who's movin'? - Pelham One Two Three. What? Since when? Just started. Hold on. I'll put ya on a tie-in. Rico, she's movin'. - Who's movin'? - Who do ya think? Pelham. - it's too soon. We're not set up yet. - Which is why they did it. You heard from Daniels yet? Yeah he's in a squad car on Park Avenue South. - [Garber] Inspector Daniels? She's movin', sir. - Who's movin'? What's the matter with everybody? How many hijacked trains we got? They're not supposed to do that yet. How far have they gone? - Grand Central? How far have they gone? - Comin' up on 23rd Street station. Better move those cops off the platform. Better follow along down Park Avenue. Get me 23rd Street. [Green] Comin' in to 23rd Street. All right. Steady as she goes now. [siren] Garber? Just had a terrible thought. Suppose they're not on the train? What if they set the throttle and jumped off? While we're chasin' the train, they're sneakin' out an emergency exit somewhere behind us. Ingenious, sir, except for one thing, it's impossible. - Why? - A gizmo known as a deadman's feature. It was built into the control handle in case the motorman should ever drop dead. The handle has to have a man's hand pressing down on it, hard, at all times. Otherwise the thing don't work. The train stops cold. Ah, I see. Nice try, though. I'll give 'em a call in case you're still worried about it. [Garber] Pelham One Two Three, what's goin' on down there? The tracks aren't cleared yet. How come you're movin'? We're moving because were trying to put some distance between us and all those policemen you've got hidden in the tunnel back there. If you keep moving, you're gonna run into a lot of red signals. - I don't want you to blame us for it. - l won't blame you for anything. Just let us know when you've cleared the track. OK, signing off. Do you think he's able to figure anything out? I mean, all those questions. Not surprising under the circumstances, is it? They're thinking just what we want them to think. Ah, there it is. OK. Stop a few yards past it, will you? [Green] All right. - [brakes screech] - Thank you, Mr. Green. He shutdown again. Pass it along. Grand Central Tower callin' Command Center. Come in, Command Center. Command Center. She stopped again, Lieutenant. Just below 18th Street station. Gotcha. Thanks. Inspector Daniels, they stopped again. Where are you? - Approachin' 17th Street. - Pull over. You're right above them. And then what? It's up to them. I'll get back to you, sir. [Garber] Pelham One Two Three. Callin' Pelham One Two Three. Come in, please. Pelham One Two Three, Pelham One Two Three, this is Command Center. Come in. Quick as you can. [Garber] Pelham One Two Three. This is Garber. Come in, please. Come in, please. Hey what the hell's goin' on out there? - Who s-s-said you could talk? - [children laugh] [children cry] Pelham One Two Three, come in. Pelham One Two Three, why don't you answer? Frank, how long before the track's cleared all the way to South Ferry? You mean before this railroad is so totally fucked - it'll take a computer to put it back together? - Yes, Frank, that's what I meant. About five or six minutes. I got a snag at Brooklyn Bridge. Start at the top... - Rico, there's somethin' goin' on down there. - Whaddaya think? I don't have the slightest idea. Listen Rico, I don't care what those clowns said, I want men on every... Wait a minute. Hold on a second. Inspector Daniels? I think we outta have officers on every platform from 14th Street down to South Ferry. That's a good idea, Lieutenant. Will do. I'll come up to 17th Street and join ya. Rico, how you coming along with that list of motormen? They're workin' on it. I told 'em to rush it through. Come on up here will ya and take over the radio for me. But don't tell 'em the track's clear until you hear from me. I don't want them startin' up again until I get there. Will do, Z. - [truck horn] - [siren] - Inspector Daniels? - Daniels. Oh, I, uh... I thought you were a, uh... like a shorter guy. I don't know what I thought. - Anythin' happenin', Inspector? - No, they're still down there. If this street collapsed, we'd probably land right on top of 'em. [Rico] Command Center to DCI, Manhattan. Yeah, Rico, this is Garber. Track's been cleared for a couple minutes now. Do you want me to call the hijackers? Yeah, let 'em know. And let us know when they start movin', will ya? What do we do? Wait or get started? If they pick up speed on us we're gonna have trouble keepin' up. I think we oughta take off, Inspector. Get a jump on them for a change. Move it. Tell the sergeant to hold the men here until further word. [Man] Yes, sir. Fits like a glove. - ls it gonna come away clean? - It's gonna work all right. [Rico] Command Center to Pelham One Two Three. Come in Pelham. - Who's that? - Give me the mic. - Here. - This is Pelham. - What happened to Garber? - Even great men have to pee. Just letting you know the track's cleared all the way to South Ferry. Thank you. Give the lieutenant my regards. - Do it yourself, at the arraignment. - Over and out. Best get going. All right, Mr. Brown. You will all remain seated. That means nobody is to get up. OK. - Now what? - Me you're askin'? OK. Come on. - Hey, where are you goin'?! - [chatter] I'm a police officer! - Mr. Blue? - Yeah, what do you want? I thought I saw somethin' f-f-fall off the back of the train. What do you mean, something? - Might've been a person. I ain't 100% sure. - All right, let's make sure. No, we haven't got time. Get back up here. Come on. Command Center Tower to Command Center, Pelham One Two Three's in motion! Where do you think they're takin' us now?! Don't worry, don't worry, they're gonna let us all go! How do you know that?! They got the money! They got what they want! [Spanish] Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Can't anybody count? They all four got off! There's nobody drivin' the fuckin' train! [shouting, screaming] [Man] Anybody in there?! All right, all clear. All right, then. You know the drill. We do it by the numbers. Hats. - Glasses. - Drills and numbers... This is all chickenshit. Why don't we just do it? Moustaches. [Blue] All right, reverse coats. Pelham One Two Three's between Astor Place and Bleecker. Speed's increasing. [Rico] Pelham One Two Three now reported between Astor Place and Bleecker. Picking up speed. Doesn't make any sense. They know we're monitoring their position, following them. - So? - So it's dumb. Huh, who said crooks were smart? These have been smart. They haven't made a single mistake. Tell ya, we're overlookin' somethin', Inspector. OK. New hats. [Blue] OK. Magazines in pockets. I never knew these things went so fast! We're gonna be killed! - Stop it! Nobody's gonna get killed! - A hell of a lot you know, old man! But I do know! I've been ridin' the subways since before you were born! I'm an expert. You see, they have something called stoppers, or stickers, or something like that. And whenever a train goes by a red light, these things stop them. - There's just one thing, baby! - What's that? They're all green! [shouts, screams] Inspector, that short move they made between 28th Street and 17th Street. - Why'd they do that? - I don't know. Suppose they wanted to do somethin' they didn't want anybody else to know about? - Like what? - Like jumpin' off the train. Turn around. We're goin' back to 17th Street. Like hell we are! They are not on the train. I'm sure of it. Look Garber, I suggested that in the first place and you shot me down. - Something about a deadman's feature? - They figured out how to beat that! That's their plan! That's what they started with! Turn this thing around and burn rubber. [brakes screech] Guns to Mr. Brown. Mr. Grey, would you be good enough to give that gun to Mr. Brown, please? No. This ain't gonna go nowhere. This is gonna stay with me. Mr. Grey, will you bring that gun back here, please. What if somethin's wrong? What if they're waitin' for us up there? I want some heavy artillery with me. - Mr. Grey, I won't ask you again. - Blow it outta your ass, Mr. Blue. Oh, my God. Let's get his money! Mr. Green, come on! [cocks gun] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] [whispering] Mr. Blue! Did you get him? [whispering] You go on ahead. We'll meet where we planned. Right? You better be right about this, Garber. Well, even if I am, it's probably too late. [siren] [gunshot] Where are those goddamn red lights?! [children crying] We're not stopping! There is going to be a red light! There has to be! - What if there isn't?! - There has to be! [siren] We gotta bottle up the emergency exits! Inspector, you take 15th Street. Officer, you take 17th Street. I'll take the one here. [Man] Right, sir. Are you a policeman? Well done. The Mayor will go to your funeral. [Garber] Excuse me, fella, would you mind droppin' that gun and turning around, please? Drop it! [drops gun] Officer, I suppose you couldn't use a quarter of a million dollars, could you? Quarter of a million? No, thanks. My accountant says I've accepted enough for this fiscal quarter. You're the English guy on the radio. Yes. - Lieutenant Garber? - Right. Do you wanna move along? Excuse me... Do you people still execute in this state? What? Oh, execute. No. Not at the moment. Pity. - [winces] - [power surging] Christ. We'll have an ambulance here in no time, miss. Everything's gonna be OK. Where are those goddamn red lights?! Oh, God! [humming] Stop! [praying in Spanish] There has to be. [Mrs. Jenkins] Jesus it's headin' to the South Ferry loop! It must be goin' about 70mph! My God! Look! We'll never make it! [screaming] [metal screeching] [children crying] I told you it would stop. Didn't I? 42nd Street already? Get that list out on the wire, will ya Wally. Tell 'em it's top priority. Whaddaya got, Rico? We got positive identification on the three dead men. Here. George Steever. Professional guy, huh? - St. Louis. - Yeah, I know how to read, Rico. Giuseppe Benvenuto, alias... [chuckles] Joe Welcome. - Where's the other guy, the guy who fried himself? - [Rico] No card on him. We got a confirm on his prints from Immigration. Name's Bernard Ryder. Mercenary soldier. Between wars, I guess. None of these guys know how to drive a train. It means it's the motorman who's missin'. Did you get that list of motormen who were discharged for cause I asked ya to get? Yeah. 78 names. 78? Yeah, but it's not that bad. Eight are dead. 22 were rehired. 11 are in jail. 26 moved away. One's in a mental institution. Another is a member of the NY Police Department. That's our man right there. Sorry to disappoint you, Zachary, but he was accounted for. - So how many does that leave? - Only nine. Only nine. All right, let's get goin'. What's the name of this guy? Nathaniel Muscat. - What'd he get busted for? - Narcotics. This way. [pounding] - [Muscat] Who's there? - Transit Police. Just a minute. What do you want? Uh, nothin', fella. Our mistake. [Man on radio] According to a spokesman for the Transit Authority they also noted that the subway car carrying the hostages was stopped at the South Ferry loop by the automatic safety features built in which are activated by any car travelling at excessive speed. - Transit Authority. - Still gotta pay. - Your name is Latimer? - What about it? Just answer the question, would ya please, fella. I don't work for you guys anymore. You don't get shit from me. Can you account for your whereabouts today, Mr. Latimer? Are you tryin' to connect me to that hijacking? Forget it! I've been here since 2:30 this afternoon. - Are you sure? - Sure? Ask anybody! - Don't worry, we will. - Hold it! It's still gonna be 50 cents. [laughter] [knocking] - Who's that? - [Rico] Police Department. Who? Harold Longman, it's the Transit Police. Oh, Jesus! Wait a minute! [Green] Just a minute! - How many more we gotta see today? - Six, seven. I don't know. [Rico] Come on, Mr. Longman, we ain't got all night! - [knocking] - I'll be right out! [toilet flushing] I hope he washes his hands before he opens the door. - Yes, what is it? - Harold Longman? Transit Police, we'd like to ask you a couple of questions. What about? Well uh, will you let us in? We'll just take up one minute of your time, Mr... I'm Lieutenant Patrone. This is Lieutenant Garber. How do you do? I'm sorry to bother you like this. [door closes] - Nice place you got here, Mr. Longman. - Thanks. Can you give us an account of your whereabouts this afternoon? Why? - Were you at work? - No. - Why not? - I work nights. - Where do you work? - Kennedy Airport. - What do you do over there? - I'm a... fork-lift operator. Oh, I got a brother-in-law does that over in Jersey. That's interesting work. What, uh... where were you this afternoon, Mr. Longman? - Why? - You tell me where, I'll tell you why. I was, uh... right here. Can anyone verify that fact? You said you'd tell me why. - [Garber] You were here all afternoon? - I sleep in the afternoon. - All afternoon? - Well... till about an hour ago. - But you heard about the hijacking? - What hijacking? - The subway train. - Subway... [laughs] - You gotta be kiddin! - Do I look like I'm kiddin'? I mean, would I be here if I was kiddin', mister? [chuckles] Subway?! Who'd wanna do a thing like that? - Hey, Z. You got a match? - No. - You got a warrant? - No. Supreme Court says you have to have a warrant, unless I'm under arrest. Yeah? Well the way things are goin', they're gonna be changin' that in about 10 minutes. - Mr. Longman, you got a match? - No. That's all right. I'll get it at the stove. [grunts] I'll get it. It's a little tricky. Has a tendency to explode. Come on, Rico, let's go. Thanks, Mr. Longman. So long, Mr. Longman, we'll be back later. Yeah? Listen, I know I got a gripe with the TA. I know I got a bum rap. But I wouldn't do anythin' as stupid as what you just told me. What do think I am, a jerk? Do me a big favor, will ya? Get the hell outta here, for christ sake. Come on, Mr. Longman. We have to follow our leads. It's our job! Yeah, yeah. Big deal. Look, I got my rights. This is my home. I want a little peace! Just do me a little favor, will ya? Get the hell outta here. Sorry if we bothered ya, Mr. Longman. Come on, Rico. - [sneezes] - Gesundheit!
