Every year the French police starts more than 800 murder investigations. Nearly 20 percent remain unsolved. This movie is about one of them. GRENOBLE, POLICE HEADQUARTERS OCTOBER 12, 2016 Speech. Yes. I love you. But I won't miss your faces. Especially not the one in my unit. Yohan, Jerôme, Loïc, Willy, Marceau, Fred. Filling in forms and fiddling with the software. Like when you magically lose a report. You said it. I see young jerks thinking that retirement is far away. That's right. If you're lucky to reach my age, that is still a vague memory. I also wanted to say... No. Dickheads. Go ahead. I can't. It's your party. Say you're proud that you take over. Okay guys. Listen. I'm very proud to take over from him. We too. You know it is. Please. Come on. Do your best. For Tourancheau. I've wondered for years how they gave a unit to a Breton who only drinks pastis. An eternal mystery. Thank you Marceau. Cheers. Thanks, Yo. Thank you, Willy. Thank you, chief. Tourancheau. La Tanche. Look at him. Bunch of assholes. For your bedroom. -We'll take a picture. -Get together. Done. Like a boss and say "cheese". Aren't you staying? -I'm going home. -You're free tomorrow. -Are you going to Wesley's? -No, I'm going to sleep. Good night then. Be careful. Do I see you tomorrow? Love you. Good night. Nanie, honey. Nanie, I adore you. You are the best friend ever. Lots of kisses for you. Clara. Who are you? Who is the black cat? Boris. -What am I? -The black cat. -It's him. -You said it. You appear and we get a case on the weekend. With a hangover. -In rural areas. -The work of the gendarme. So you bring bad luck. That's not funny. -You have the evil eye. -You were on duty. Is that normal on your first night? You are unlucky. Fred was also on duty. Fred never gets a case during his duty. It's your fault. Blaming a colleague is cowardly. Show some team spirit. Or it's because of Yohan. New chief and boom. Yes. The gendarmes are annoyed. It's their area. We don't belong here. Why didn't they get it? We have enough work in the city. Chief said the prosecutor insisted that we take it. He must think we're better. And that is true. -Hello. -Hello, police. We do the houses. Can we come in? Heard from the coroner? He took a wrong turn. He'll be right there. Clara? Hello? Hello Clara? This is Inspector Vivès from the police. We found this phone. Can you tell me who you are calling? Clara who? Are you from the police? Yes. Please answer me. Clara who? Royer. Clara Royer. Y-E-R? Yes. Do you know her address? Chemin des Terres Blanches 17. Her parents' house. Do you have her phone? I can't say anything now. May I have your name? Nanie who? Béguin. Stéphanie Béguin. Can you do the talking? If you want to. I would rather. I hate telling parents that their child is dead. Autopsy and dirty stuff I can handle it, but that... Yes? Mrs. Royer? Yes. -Hello Madam. -Hello. We're from the police. Yes... What is this about? Can we come in? What is going on? Is there a problem? Let's go inside. Is your husband at home? He's at work. -Shall I call him? - We'll take care of that. When will he come home? No idea. 6 p.m. or 6:30 p.m. What is going on? Sit down. It will take a while. Can you tell me now? Last night a young woman has been murdered. We have reason to... Yohan... We have reason to believe that it is your daughter. What? A girl has been murdered. We think it's Clara. -Clara? -Yes. She's with Nanie. No, she was with Nanie, but did not stay to sleep there. - She's with Nanie, I'm telling you. -Madam... She didn't sleep over. She was attacked on the way back. What do you mean? Nanie, where's Clara? Isn't she there? -I do not get it. -Sit down, ma'am. -What is wrong? -Sit down, please. I don't want to sit. Look at me. We are the police. We think the murdered young woman is your daughter. What do you mean? That is not true. You are lying to me. You are lying. Go away. Out of my house. Nanie. I want to see her. Where is she? Where is she? Where is she? clara. We were together. We had fun and we chatted. Who knew about that night? I don't know. Was Clara meeting someone when she left? No. No... She wanted to go home. Did Clara have problems? Conflicts with others? No. She got along with everyone. She was kind. Broken relationships? Yes, a few. She fell in love easily. Recently? No. The last months she was dating Wesley. She knew him through work. The bowling alley in La Toussuire. La Toussuire? The ski resort. Wesley who? Fontana. Wesley Fontana. She sent me a video. When? Yesterday evening. Right after she left. Can I see it? Nanie, I adore you. You are the best friend ever. Lots of kisses for you. I need that video. Something strange happened. I informed the mother and then I saw a picture of Clara with a cat. I blocked. I couldn't utter a word. That's because you saw the body. After that it's more difficult. Perhaps. It felt like I was standing on an abyss. I saw her mother but my head was empty. You froze. It happens. It was so strange. I thought I was dead. You're way too wound up. You're right. Did Clara live here? Yes. She didn't always sleep here. We didn't interfere in everything. But she lived here. Do you know her boyfriend? -Wesley? -Yes. Not very well. Clara was discreet about her feelings. Wesley picked her up. We spoke once. She seemed in love. Were you close? I think so. We never discussed intimate things, if that's what you mean. She did that with her mother. How would you describe her? I am her father. I see her through a father's eyes. I would say... Intelligent. Yes. And cheerful. Set a girl on fire. He's a psychopath. Maybe a fanatic? This takes planning. You need a jerry can and a lighter. It's not like stabbing or strangling. You must be crazy to think: I will burn her. So strangling or stabbing is okay? No, but you can follow the mindset. You imagine that he went crazy. But what was that guy thinking? It feels like punishment. Like an acid attack. Do you remember the last one? With acid they want to danmage a girl permanently. Maybe he didn't want to kill. A stupid psychopath? Why not? And we keep saying "he". Maybe it's a she. Women always get burned. Joan of Arc, witches... Men are beheaded, crucified or shot. Rarely burnt. Some burn themselves in protest in Tibet. You can compare suicide for a purpose with this maniac. That's right. Even if women don't burn, men start the fire. Sometimes at a barbecue. Beard on fire, you jump into the pool and yell: "Shit, I'm on fire." Finish your reports, assholes. Sorry for asking this now, but what about overtime? Do you note that? You're off to a bad start. -How old are you? -27. And are you already counting the hours? It's a job, not a volunteer job. Overtime is normal if it is included. Normal in a normal world. You get money when the world is normal. 'Mr. and Mrs Tudesque 'declare that they 'have seen and heard nothing. 'At 26 rue Jean Huguet, Mrs and Mr Vovelle 'declare that they 'have seen and heard nothing.' Fred... Can you do it quietly? Yes. Sorry. Yohan... Does this case have extensive jurisdiction? No. Why? The gendarmes are competent. It remains our jurisdiction. Isn't it 18.3? No. Okay. Unbelieveable. I'm tired of this. What is it? Another problem. Now the ink is leaking. The rollers are stuck again. -Did you use the elastic? -That was my idea. So yes. You will also need the wedge. The wedge, the elastic band, I close it, press the button and it doesn't work. I'm a cop, not a tech. I want to print my reports. Is that too much to ask? Best regards to Natalie. Can we talk? Of course. It's all going to shit. It's going to be a divorce. She is pregnant. Pregnant and you are getting a divorce? It's a mess. We tried to have children. She preferred it. I thought I was too old. I was not against it and I started to get used to the idea. We went off birth control. Nothing happened. I told myself that it would work. But not Natalie. She became increasingly stressed. She checked dates, her temperature, and so on. She did tests. I had to to see if it was me. It drove me crazy. And? The fertility tests gave no clue. We are not barren. The gynecologist said that we had to be patient. Three months ago, she meets a guy. She doesn't even hide it. She sees him regularly. She sleeps less and less at home. I'm at peace with it. I think it will blow over. Last weekend she said she is pregnant and wants a divorce. Imagine... Already pregnant after three months. I was really upset about that. It didn't go great, but now... The fact that he succeeds immediately... It's not fair. See you tomorrow. Do you know Clara Royer? Yes. I know her. But not very well. Aren't you together? Together? -Yes and no. -Yes and no? Her father says yes. No not at all. She is an acquaintance. When did you meet? I do not know exactly. A week, a month or two years ago? Less than six months ago. She filled in for the shoe issueing. I was behind the bar and to be nice I offered her a drink. Without ulterior motive. And? I let myself be seduced. -We had sex. -And then? We kept seeing each other. To be fair, Clara is... She's not my type. She's cute and all, but not... This is weird. I talk about myself but what's going on? -What did Clara say? -Nothing. She is dead. What? She was murdered. You are sick. Should have told you right. - Then I wouldn't have said that. - What? I thought... What? I thought she had done something. - Or said bad things. - Like? No idea. Because she was in love and I wasn't. Why? It is like this. Clara... She was a nice girl. But I forced myself to date her. She continued to chase me and my girlfriend and me just took it easy... Did you have a fight? No. -As a couple. -We weren't a couple. She was in love. Wasn't she jealous? Never. And is your official girlfriend jealous? She doesn't know. Can you keep that quiet? He's doing great. What a romantic. We spoke to Clara's friends and Fred takes care of the telephone data. Her timeline is clear. She was home most of the time. She watched TV and chatted with friends. At 4 p.m she went to a climbing gym. We have the members. A name appears in Clara's contacts: Jules Leroy. Lately Leroy was in the hall if Clara was there too. Including the 12th. Interesting. This is him. He lives with his grandmother. -Is he 12? -No, 21. Just like Clara. Just like Willy in a wig. -Your dream. -It would suit you. And the boyfriend? Wesley... His girlfriend confirms his alibi. Tracking has been requested on his phone. And listening? Yes. Him and his girlfriend. And his boss. -Hello Madam. Police. -Hello. We want to see Jules Leroy. Yes. I think he's still asleep. Fine, we'll wake him up. Can you show us his room? Yes. Come on in. Follow me. Down the stairs. Thank you Madam. The new champion is crazy. I love him. I didn't realize that. Are you covering me? Go on. Yes, cool. That jerk got me. Damn, I'm dead. Jules Leroy? Yes. I don't know what to say. Did you see her that day? Yes. At the gym. Let's start with that. Which gym? The climbing gym. I coached her a little bit. When was she there? No idea. She didn't stay long. One hour. From 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. Okay. And then? - Then she left. - Where to? I don't know. Did you have a sexual relationship? Does that matter? I ask, you answer. If you don't answer, we'll note it. Did you have sex? That happened, yes. Did you know she had someone? Yes, and I have a girlfriend. It was nothing. It was easy with Clara. We were sex buddies. -Sex buddiess? -Yes. We had sex as friends. -We weren't in love. -Did she talk about her boyfriend? That didn't bother me. Did he know about you? Ask him. It would surprise me. Why? She wouldn't want him to know that she was cheating. Did she say that? No. I don't know... Did she never talk about him? I didn't care. I'm not jealous. But he is, do you think? Yes probably. All the boys are jealous, so... But not you. I've decided not to be. But basically we are all jealous. Yes. So was he jealous? Yes probably. What's so funny? Sorry. - I had to think of something. - What? Something a friend... Something a friend said. Do you know how Clara died? She was set on fire. -I think. -You think? She was burned alive. Come on, say it. She was burned alive. How did Clara die? -Burned alive. -Yes. Stupid bastard. Do you believe that sex friend thing? Isn't it right? Not for The case, in real life. I have to be in love to fuck. You are the sentimental type. He said she was easy. No, that things were easy. -Same. -Easy doesn't mean easy in bed. Yes? And you annoy me, is with three r's. Well? Did you like the morgue? Awesome. Did you throw up? No. No blows. Cause of death: smoke suffocation. Negative tox test. Little alcohol. No sex in the preceding hours. Okay. - I don't smell like... - What? Dead. The morgue. A little. Take a shower. Do you have clean clothes? Drop a few here. Ask Fred, he has extra. Do you know Jules Leroy? Yes. He attended our professional school. Did you know Clara slept with him? Yes. Why didn't you say anything? I didn't think about it. You should have. Otherwise I think you are hiding something. Won't you protect him? No. No not at all. It didn't seem important. That's about it. You probably know why. If Clara had multiple relationships, I need to know. Jealousy is a catalyst in many crimes. Sorry. Give me all the names. Anyone with a connection. No one knew her better. Gabi Lacazette. -With a "Z"? -Yes. Who is that? He lives in the housing project. He went to school with us. Clara dated him. Right before Wesley. Did she leave him for Wesley? I think it was over when she met him. But she said Gabi was jealous. What else did she say? I don't know... She liked it to be seen with him. She loved bad boys. Were there others? Others? She loved bad boys. Who are the others? Stop withholding information. Yes? Okay. I'm coming to pick him up. Jerôme. -What? -You're talking nonsense. Lacazette answered my call. You all right, Mr. Top Gun? I knew you wanted to see me. I called the gendarmes. For real? When? When I heard it, on the 14th. They said it was none of their business. -Didn't they tell you to call us? -No. Why would we want to speak to you? Because of the song. -Which song? -That I wrote about Clara. Which song exactly? A rap about her. -Didn't you hear? -No. I thought that's why I was here. What is it about? About me setting her on fire. Why did you sing that? She wasn't fair to me. Clara was not the faithful type. She wasn't. It was not easy. We couldn't go to her home. She wanted me to treat her like a princess. I work. Half is for my mother. The rest to start my label. I can't afford hotels for a quick screw. Can we hear the song? Yes, it's on YouTube. I want you to sing it. What? Here and now? Yes. Here and now. I can not do it. I need a track and a beat. A beat? You don't need that. Can't you just do it? Come on. Come on. Clara, just to be clear I'm at your window With a Molotov cocktail to set you on fire You will suffer It's cool, I have a gun when gasoline is not enough You will burn in hell Prepare for the flames I'll set you on fire Get charred I will burn you to ashes OK, that's enough. -You asked yourself. -It is obvious. I hadn't done it if I had known this. -But you did. -It's just words. But words? Words matter. It was not me. I couldn't do such a thing. I'm not violent. Not violent? Do you hear what you sing? You would burn her. You all want to burn girls. How is that possible? How do you come up with such ideas? What if that inspired a maniac? Have you thought about that? Then you would be complicit. -Should I stay here? -You can count on it. Can you let my mother know? She worries if I don't come back. Stick to the facts. How do you mean? He irritates you, but if you only talk, it's counterproductive. -Was I counterproductive today? -A little bit. I have to take a piss. Marceau. Willy says you sleep here. It's a hassle at home with Nathalie. No worries. I'll manage. Toilet, bathroom... You can sleep here. But don't spray everything under when you pee. -Are you serious about this? -Yes. I'm not cleaning up your piss. I can aim well. When you see the toilet at work. There are 24 of us. Don't just blame me. Don't take a chance and go piss sitting down. You're pretty bad. Didn't you know that? Not to that extent. Hello, this is Emilie. I'm not here right now, so leave a message. Bye. Honey, me again. Can't you pick up? I didn't care about Clara. She didn't mean anything. Just a girl... Marion, it's Jules. Are you okay? Yes, are you? I was wondering... -Are you coming to the gym? -Good. Okay, cool. Last time was really fun... Call me. I can't live without you. I'm afraid of losing you. You are the love of my life. This came in the mail. It's a little strange. Thank you. For the leading agent of the Clara case Fred... Come take a look. Posted at St Jean. If it's him, he's crazy. That's not allowed out of the office. I know. I keep thinking about Nathalie. I love her so much. When I lie down, I hear my heart pounding. It stresses me out. Go to the psychologist. The psychologist... 'In the lonely, old park On the icy grass 'Two contours passed each other' Do you know it? No. You don't learn anything these days. Paul Verlaine. Colloque sentimental. 'Their eyes are dead Their mouths weak 'And you hardly hear them speak 'There on the icy grass 'Two ghosts talk about the past' Rest in peace - we miss you Nanie, I adore you. You're the best friend ever. Lots of kisses for you. Nanie, I adore you. You're the best friend ever. Lots of kisses for you. She filmed him. What? She filmed him. Where? Someone is sitting on the bench. It could be a shadow. No, look. It's the bench. He's waiting for her. Even though it is, it's just pixels. Come on. My balls are freezing off. Yohan? Are you with the police? Are you investigating Clara's death? Why are you interested in that? I've been watching you for a while. Who are you? Dennis. Dennis who? Douet. I sent the lighter. Which lighter? A transparent, yellow lighter that I found. Maybe the killer has dumped it when he left. Not received? Show me where you found it. I found it here. Where do you live? Here. What do you mean? Over here. Why didn't we see you during our door-to-door visit? No idea. I was here. Maybe your colleague thought that it was empty. -Do you live here? -Yes, it's my uncle's. He takes care of the vegetable garden. That's not my thing. I don't really like vegetables. What are you doing all day? Not much lately. I sleep poorly, so I stay in bed in the morning. I felt so bad about Clara that I smoked a lot. If I say that, you lock me up. Did you know Clara? Yes. I'm one of her exes. -An ex? -Yes. We had sex a few times. But we broke up. We saw each other less. We were never officially together. We secretly met. She came here when she had a fight with her parents. I gave her cigarettes if she had nothing left. When did you last see her? I don't know. I can't say that. The night she was murdered? No. She wasn't far from here. I haven't seen her. Didn't you hear anything? No. -Hello. -Hello. I'm looking for Stéphanie Béguin. I'll get her. She's in the kitchen. Can you tell me about Denis Douet? Do you know him? Denis? Yes, from face. Didn't I put him on the list? Precisely. Sorry. Clara knew him vaguely. He lives in a shed in the allotments. Did she sleep with him? With him? Not really. He's filthy. She was disgusted with him. Just by talking about him... Who says that? She or you? What do you mean? What did she tell you? What I said. That he was dirty. Was he trying to hit on her? He was a leech. She got angry when he got too close. After that she stayed away from him. She didn't tell me much. I disapproved. He does not work. The only thing he does is smoking and masturbating. Sorry, but that's how it is. Could she have had sex with him? No. Or she didn't tell you. What does it matter? She didn't do it. You don't get it. It wasn't her fault. She has done nothing. You ask what she did with him and the others. It sounds like she was a slut. Did she have sex with them? Does that matter? She has committed no crime. Nobody says that. Nobody says it but you say she had sex. And you ask me if maybe it was her fault. And I provide answers. Do you want to know why she was killed? I know, so I tell. Because she was a girl. That's the reason. She was a girl. Clara wasn't like that. She wasn't like that. Clara loved to be liked. She always fell for the wrong one. Maybe she turned that bastard down. I don't know. But she was a sweet girl. She wanted to laugh and have fun. And I can only say sick things about her. She was my best friend. I miss her. Where did you buy the lighter? I found it. I showed you where. When did you find it? How? - I already told you. - Tell me again. On the 15th I went to get food and I found it by my car. -Just like that? On your way? -Yes. Why did you send it? - To help. - To find you? - What? - Did you want to be noticed? I don't get it. Do you know she was disgusted with you? She deleted all your apps. You felt her contempt and wanted to punish her. -Quiet. -You don't talk, counselor. Punish because she rejected you. You are crazy. Yes? What did you think? Nothing. I could never do such a thing. Get a lie detector if you don't believe me. You will see. So 'I went to get food on October 15th. 'The lighter was by my car. I sent it to the police for help.' -Is that right? -Yes. - I didn't kill Clara Royer. - Precisely. I have done nothing. Are you angry or is it just me? What? That I think you're angry. Or am I making you angry? Maybe if you keep going like this. Okay. You are angry. What do you mean? Nothing. I am angry and stressed and try to calm down. If you annoy me, I can't. We have a weird job. Don't we? Spare me the riddles. Say it or keep quiet. I'm tired. I'm just saying we have a weird job. We interrogate people, look at stuff, listen to their calls and we write reports, one after the other. Right. We fight evil writing reports. We're not fighting anything. Not one solid clue, no evidence. Not even a good printer. It's good versus evil with a bad printer. It is also a region. Where? In Botswana. It's also wood. He is now a geographer. Indicate the harissa. Watch out, it's hot. Why do you look so happy? Finally had sex? Go on, say it. I'm getting married. What? I'm going to marry Pauline. -Who is Pauline? -My girlfriend. -Are you serious? -Yes. Can babies get married? A real wedding by the mayor? Yes, by the mayor. I proposed and she said yes. It's in March. -Is she pregnant? -No. Not yet anyway. Then why are you marrying her? For fun. To make her my wife, to be her husband. And to throw a big party. Only to party? Yes. Have you known each other long? -Six months. -Six months? Wow. We are in love. Okay, if you're in love... Cut it off. Rushing things is not good. Why do you say that? -We are clear. -Let him. He's happy. No, someone has to tell him. OK, I'll explain. Get married and start a family is already a stupid idea. For a cop your age is it suicide. -I don't think so. -You'll see it. -I'll see. -When you run into a wall. Not all marriages fail like with you. You are bitter and believe in nothing. It was love at first sight. For God sake. You scare me. You're driving me crazy. Does she know you're going to the whores? I often go to the playground to… To see who's thinking about Clara. Maybe it's stupid... This morning I found this. This T-shirt. I think it's a bloodstain. I didn't touch it. I picked up gloves and put it in the plastic bag. I also took pictures. To show where it was. Please. I hope it's a clue. The blood belongs to Vincent Caron, 31, with a criminal record. Three years ago he hit the mother of his child. triple jaw fracture, five broken teeth. With his fists. In front of his 4 year old. She lost consciousness after he tried to strangle her. She also had bruises all over. Broken ribs. He was released after four months and he awaits his case. He now lives in Mondane with a teacher, Nathalie Bardot. -Hello. -Hello, police. -Vincent Caron? -Yes. Marceau. Go get him. Is this yours? This is not my house. Can you answer them? I use that as a stain remover. Stain remover? Yes. Okay... Your lawyer had two hours to get here. -We begin. -He's in Lyon. Not my problem. You refused a designated attorney. Fuck off with lawyers. You don't frighten me. -Do you recognize this one? -Yes, that's mine. And the blood? Also mine. -Did you know Clara Royer? -Yes. How come? Informal? We're not friends. Good... How did you know her? She sent a friend request on Facebook. We chatted a bit there. And then? Then we made a date. She was shy at first, but could not be stopped after the ice was broken. What does that mean? She liked my animal side. Can you be more specific? We fucked hard. -Where? -That depended. At my friend's house when she was gone. In my car. Wherever the inspiration took us. Did she know about your legal troubles? Not that I know. But she wasn't biased. -What do you mean? -That people are black or white. -Did Vincent tell you about Clara? -Yes. What did he say? That they had sex. When did he say that? In January, I think. When we saw each other. Did he want to make you jealous? No not at all. I knew he needed others. -Didn't you mind? -No. I knew she was addicted. But I didn't want to force it. Addicted to what? To me. I knew her from before. I liked her. That's why I put down my T-shirt. -A gift. -Yes? Yes, a gift. I cut my arm, bloodied the T-shirt and left it. Why did you wait? I wanted to avoid the circus. Did he tell you that Clara was dead? I saw it in the newspaper. When I realized it was her, I told Vincent. -Do you think he killed her? -No. He was with me that night. From when to when? The whole night. After the evening together, he stayed. Which date? I forget now... The evening of the 12th. -What day was it? -I forgot that. The date, not the day? You are trying to influence me. I was free the next day, the 13th. He continued to sleep. -Did you sleep? -Yes. He could have slipped away. No. I woke up several times. My cat was sick. Vincent hasn't moved. Where were you on October 12? I was at Nathalie's house. -When did you last see Clara? -April. -Not since then? -No. Why not? She had met someone else. -Were you mad at her? -No. I respect other people's choices. I'm not forcing anyone. Don't you force anyone? Did respect break your ex's jaw? It was just a fight. Naturally. She was hysterical and fell. I had to calm her down. -With your fists? -No. That was different. Do you know he has been accused of domestic violence? That was an accident. You don't know him. -Are you afraid of him? -No. -Is he violent towards you? -No. Why are you protecting him? You know nothing. He didn't do anything. Clara's friends didn't know about Vincent Caron. She hadn't told anyone not even Nanie. Maybe she was ashamed. That guy is crazy. She picked strange guys. What do you mean? Nothing. I'm just saying. What do you say? She went after freaks. -She wasn't a saint. -Who is talking about saints? No one. I only said it. I don't believe in coincidence. Don't believe in coincidence? So? What's your idea? That she asked for it? Will we find the culprit this way? Can't I say what I think? -Not if it's bullshit. -Guys... Calm down. I know girls who like dangerous things. Dangerous? She's burned. Do you know women who like that? I'm just saying that some women love bastards. But you are above that. -Above what? -Malice. You're a nice, good guy. -Stop. -I mean it. He thinks he is of impeccable behavior. I'm worthless but you are perfect. Shut up. Just shut up. May I ask you something? Why don't you cycle on the road like the rest? You keep driving in circles... That's strange, isn't it? You're like a hamster. I quit. With what? With everything. I'm tired of these assholes. I only feel hatred. This is not what I wanted to do. I wanted to teach French. Passing on the power of the French language. I'll get you a sleeping pill. We'll talk about it tomorrow. Sleep on it overnight. -We fucked hard. -Burned alive. She's cute and all, but not... I'm not violent. At my friend's house when she was gone. We had sex... I forced myself to date her. It was easy with Clara. We were sex friends. -The point is... -...my animal side... Not my type... -Jealous. -I let myself be seduced... Not the faithful type. You will burn in hell Prepare for the flames I'll set you on fire Get charred I will burn you to ashes... Natalie Bardot. Please leave a message. Vincent. Why do not you answer? Natalie Bardot. Please leave a message. It's me. Isabelle said that you weren't at work. -Hi. -Where were you? -Home. -And before that? I was here. Don't fucking lie to me. I was here. Why didn't you pick up, bitch? Maybe the phone didn't ring. I'm not retarded. You're cheating on me. Stupid bitch. We need to discuss this. Do you hear me, worthless bitch? I'll come over and smash your skull in, slut. I'll kill you, bitch. So wait for me. Say you're waiting for me. OK, I'll wait for you. Yohan... Marceau has gone to see Caron. Damn. -Yes? -What is going on? I'm going to see Caron. Not a good idea. A very good idea. No, come back. I'll be fine. Damn. It's Marceau. Leave a message. Jerk. Who is there? Police. Open up. - Is Caron here? - No, he's gone. What are you doing? Then I'll wait for him. You have the same name as my wife. Excuse me? You have the same name as my wife. Which zodiac sign are you? Scorpion. Really? My wife is Aries. But your names are the same. Listen, Nathalie. If you change his alibi, we'll make sure he doesn't hurt you. On the evening of the 12th, you woke up and he was gone. You looked at the clock. It was 1:00 am. -He came back at 4:30. -Not true. He was there. I stood up for my sick cat. Enough about that cat. - Do you have a warrant? -Quiet. Oh yeah? Do you like hitting women? Do you like that? That too? And that? And this then? Go ahead. And this then? Marceau. Stop. Stop. Come on. Come on. If he files a suit, I'll run into him. Shut your mouth. Do you think I wouldn't? - Where are you going? - Grenoble. No. You ride with me. That's an order. Marceau. Nobody needs to know. Wake up. They'll find out. Will I have problems for tackling that shit? Are you stupid? It's an investigation. Werespect the procedure. I'm not an idiot. Oh no? If he's the killer and he gets out because of your nonsense, I won't forgive you. I mean it. I won't forgive you. You know what? You irritate me. You all annoy me. Stop the car. Stop. Stop the car now. Stop. Inspector Vivès? Yes. Hello. I'm Judge Beltrame. Follow me. Sit down. Sorry, it doesn't look very welcoming. I inherited 130 cases when I came here. It's always worse than you can imagine. But I'm quite methodical, so hopefully this will save me. I'm glad I met you. Emails and phone calls are nice, but actually meeting each other is better. I hear you're not talkative. -Is that right? -Are you overwhelmed? Not really. I wanted to talk to you about Clara Royer's murder. I was surprised to find the case at the bottom of the pile. At the bottom and tucked away in a cupboard. I do not understand. My unit is no longer working on that case. -Yes. Why not? I asked the chief to hand it over. I felt that a fresh look was needed. After the first weeks it got a lot more difficult. It is now three years later. It makes me sick but it's over. Clara was 21. She was burned alive. You can't say it's over. Even without media attention she deserves better. I worked hard on it. That's why I sent for you. Resume the investigation. That's not a good idea. I've looked at the case. It is strong. Well constructed. Even the reports are accurate, with an eye for detail. I thought they were very well written. Well written, but useless. Eliminating clues is helpful. We haven't found the killer. That's a fact. We screwed up. I do not know where. I understand your bitterness. But that's not the point. I'm not bitter. They say every detective has a case that sticks with him. Nobody knows why but that case hurts extra. It gnaws at you until it becomes an obsession. It swallows you up. Or destroys you. Indeed. It eats you from the inside out. When I started in Rouen, I had a colleague. For him it was a missing girl that they never found. After 20 years, he still hadn't dealt with it. I was young. I thought he was just saying something. For Tourancheau, our old unit boss, it was a grandmother who had been beaten to death with a frying pan. She wiped up her blood before she rolled into the dog rug so she died without making a mess. That gripped him for a while. He couldn't find out who cleaned away the blood When he finally realized, it broke his heart. For you it's Clara. I was crazy about everyone who we spoke to could be the culprit. Maybe the killer wasn't among them. But they could have done it. That's the only way to put it into words. Everyone she met even those who weren't jerks. Maybe all men whom she had never met. I must be crazy but I don't think we'll find him because all the men killed Clara. Something is wrong between men and women. I am a woman. And an investigative magistrate. I'd be blind if I didn't see that something is wrong between men and women. As you say. I realized yesterday that it's almost the day of Clara's death. In two weeks it is three years after her murder. The person who committed the murder may feel remorse. Who knows? Or wants to get a new kick. I'd like to tap the phones of the prime suspects. Something might happen. We wanted to try that after the first year. I even wanted to patrol the crime scene. That was not possible due to budget. Then another matter took precedence. That's too bad. What does she expect? That the perpetrator calls his mother and feels guilty the last three years? Something like that. Isn't this a waste of time? The judge is hopeful, so am I. Is she pretty? Why do you ask that? No idea. Just so. That is mine. Sorry, I wanted to ask. A gentian. Okay. Strange. Not a great photo but i'm starting to like it. A friend sent it. A colleague who left three years ago. -Did he retire? -Not really. It's complicated. He was transferred. I've heard about him. Marteau. Marceau. But not a mime player. No news since his departure and now he sends this. Without note. Now I print it. On paper, not in your head. You're right. That's exactly it. You talked about it to stake out the crime scene. Let's do that. It's hypothetical, but worth a try. I'm asking narcotics for the car on the evening of the 12th. Very good. -Anything else. -What? Her grave. We can hide a camera at Clara's grave. Who can take care of that? Our techies. But it's short notice. Ask if they would do that. I was thinking about a fake tombstone to hide the camera. Are you serious? Is it a stupid idea? -A little, but I'm okay with it. -Beautiful. - Can you arrange budget for that? - Yes. I already did that. I think I'm falling in love with you. Don't talk nonsense. OCTOBER 12, 2019 -Do you want coffee? -No thanks. Why the crime squad? You were the best of your year, you had a wide choice. With faster promotion. I don't like uniforms. I like to investigate. finding evidence, interrogations, matching facts... Investigate other agents. I mean real research. Do you like the violent side? Yes. That's not the hard part. Then what? I heard it's the elite. -With evolved guys. -Isn't it true? You are less racist than most cops, but there are plenty of jerks. -Is it that bad? -Yes. But I don't mean you. Isn't it crazy that most perpetrators are men and especially men need to resolve cases? Men kill and men are police. Strange, right? I don't know. A man's world. Do you think he's coming? He won't find much. Look. It is going to rain. Where's the camera? On the next grave, they said. That must be it. Here it is. Try turning it. Well? Nothing. An old woman visits a grave. The gardener. Would you like to see it? No. Fast forward. A cat. Night vision. Another cat. Funny. It had white paws. Forward. Forward on. Stop. It's for you. It's for you. We have someone at Clara's grave. Do we know him? No, never seen before. Okay. You cannot be serious. He talks. Do we have sound? Image only. Hello. Follow me please. He sings. In English. Not French. But I don't know English sign language. -Isn't that universal? -No. She translates it. Can we see that again? Night... Angel... Angel in the night. Angel in the night? Angel in the night. Angel in the night. And then? Come and hold me tight. What's that in English? Can she write it? "Come and hold me tight." Can you look it up? There is an Angel in the Night, 1983, from The Toxic Ivies. What do we do with this? Angel in the night Come and hold me tight. Save me from the shadows Chase away my sorrow..." Not a hit or famous. Does it help? Not really. This angel in the night thing... It continues to bother me. It seems familiar to me, but I don't know why. Maybe something can be found. Something on the city security camera? Nothing. They cannot pay the provider. No camera security for months. Did you show the screenshot to Clara's friends? Yes. Nobody recognizes him. I talk to you soon. Thank you. Can you step aside? -Wait a second. -Watch the door. Forward. Turn the sofa. Carefully. Is it going well? It's through. Thanks guys. It is huge and takes up all the space. We move the little one. -Where do we put it? -I'll take it. -Did you ask? -No. That's a three-seater, these two. We win. Fred, this isn't eBay. You know I need the couch. My new house is small. Also bring the microwave. I found him. The guy from the graveyard. I searched comments on messages on news websites. This was in the first article about Clara's death, with a photo. Look what's written. You are my angel in the night Mats. There are thousands with that name on social networks. I found this profile with filters. That's him, isn't it? Yes that is him. Well done. He's there. Let me go. Were you in the St Jean cemetery on October 12? -Yes. -Why? To see someone. That's not a crime. Who? A girl who died. Were you at Clara Royer's grave? Why? To pay my respects. -To talk to her? -Yes. Do you talk to the dead? No. I wanted to talk to her. What did you mean? -I can't say that. -No? You'll have to. I can not help you. Don't fool us. How did you know her? -From the hospital. -Which? In Chambéry. -Did you meet her in the hospital? -Yes. Okay and what happened? Nothing. I liked her. Yes, she was beautiful. So you wanted to burn her? -That's not it. -What then? What then? I was sad about what was done to her. What you did to her. I do not get it. Did you know where she lived? No. Yohan... You didn't know where she lived. Mats was in the psychiatric ward in Chambéry. Jérôme has them on the line. Do you mean 2016? Thanks, I'll be in touch. It's not him. His psychiatrist says he was admitted at that time. He read about Clara's death and became fixated on her. Three months ago he was still talking about her. Sorry. I was so sure. Do you believe in ghosts? Believing is not necessary. I think the dead are with us. They torment us so that we don't forget them. I lost my parents eight years ago. I thought I would die of grief. It felt like I was in a parallel world, in which they lived somewhere while I was dead. But in the end, no... I accepted. Now I know some dead stay with us forever. And the important things we do are for them. Hi Marceau. Hi Marceau. How are you? Your picture hangs on the wall in the office. I look at it often and try to fathom the mystery. The Clara case remains unsolved, despite a tough new judge. We thought we had the culprit, but we were wrong again. Maybe you were right and I am the black cat. We have a new recruit. Nadia. She's young, but she's got something. Ghosts don't frighten her. I have high hopes for her. And I followed your advice. I escaped from the velodrome. My first goal isthe Col de la Croix-de-Fer. A descent of 22 kilometers and an inclination of 11%. I set the bar high. I'll let you know if I make it. Let's hear from you. Yohan. This fiction film is based on true events.
