Quit Part-time Job. Thank you for everything. Collection by Vendor. It'll be about 30,000 yen for all of them. Bank. Multi-purpose bank account passbook, Shoya Ishida I'd like to withdraw all the money. Here's the money I owe you. Final Day. A SILENT VOICE The Movie Everyone take your seats. You have a new classmate starting today. What?! Could be good, Ishida It's going to be a girl. I don't care. Al right. First of all, introduce yourself. It's nice to meet you. My name is Shoko Nishimiya. I would like to get to know everyone through this notebook. When you want to talk to me, please use this notebook. I can't hear. Holy crap! Nice to meet you, Nishimiya-san. My name is Miki Kawal. It's nice to meet you. Hey, can you speak Japanese, Nishimiya-san? That's not a nice way to put it, Nao-chan. Could you please repeat that? Do you have a nickname? Take that! Oh, your nickname is Sho-chan! That's the same as Ishida. Her nickname is Sho-chan. That's cool. Huh?! No, that's not cool. Take that! Make sure to write this down. The exercises on page 20 to page 25, and page 32. Those are going to be on the next mini test. Give me your notebook. Firstly, there's the fulcrum. As the word suggests, it's a support point. Secondly, a power point is where it holds in power. A site of action is where it moves the weight up and down. Depending on the position of these three points, the lever... Nishimiya-san. It's still too early. I'll let you know when to start. Let's try again. We're in serious trouble for the choir contest. It's a losing battle, isn't it? This is for saying something stupid. Ouch, that hurts. Ouch! Enough is enough. I didn't catch what was being said again. I'll give you a copy of my note later. Yeah, that'll be great. I didn't do anything bad. So I will never say, "I'm sorry." Ueno, why are you reading it like that? Jeez, that's enough. Next. Turd-glasses. Nishimiya. You need to read it from here. "'Stop being stubborn. ...the mother said with an amazed look on her face. He had no intention to apologize." Good. Ishida, you're next. You gotta be kidding me. Stop messing around, Ishida. When you want to talk to me, please use this notebook. Let's go home. See ya, Nishimiya-san. You know... ...at this rate, everyone's gonna get fed up with you. Friends. What...? You creep me out. I'm Kita sensei from “The hearing classroom.” Do you all know what sign language is? "Communicate with hands." That's how you write it. As the name suggests, it means to talk with your hands. Isn't it amazing? -Therefore... -Sign language. In order to be able to talk to Shoko more... Let's use three minutes of the morning session every day to learn sign language. -Sensei! -Yes? Can't we just write in her notebook? It's easier for Shoko to use sign language. It's easier for me to write than to use sign language. I'll learn sign language. Teach me how to say Miyoko Sahara in sign language. Sahara Miyoko. -Sa-ha... -Nice job scoring those brownie points. I really like him. He's so cute! Yeah, and he's going to be in the TV drama next week. We have to watch it. What is it with her fashion sense? Don't be mean, Nao-chan. Throughout the author's work we can discern a certain... From the results of the experiment, you can see that the manganese... Hirose, you should write over there. Nishimiya. What are you doing, Ishida? You shouldn't do that. Star. That's too much, Ishida. Really? I think this will do. You're such a jerk. Come on, it's not that bad. Looks good! Congrats, Nishimiya-san. You made Sahara-san disappear. Who did such a thing?! Horrible! I'll erase it for you. There. All done. Thank you. You're welcome. Let's go. Hey, Ishida! We're still in class. Yes, sir, I'm sorry! Where were we? They used to live in a house where... That startled you, didn't it? Hey, Nishimiya-san. Are these...? Does this mean you can actually hear? Yeah, I was thinking about that too. Let me see that for a second. Ueno. What's that? Let me see that for a second. What is this?! Eww, it has something on it! Did you say something? Nishimiya-san, are you okay?! What should we do? Nishimiya-san! You took it too far! Faculty Office That turd-glasses really pisses me off! What? Move out of the way. You're in the way. What is this person doing? Let's go home. I'm sorry. Liar! If you have a problem with this, say something! Let me go! You're creeping me out! That was totally hilarious, Nishimiya-san! You're blushing, Shoya! No, I'm not! Let's just go. Are you serious, Nishimiya-san?! Dude, that's crazy. Bye, Shoya. See you tomorrow. There's something we would like to discuss with you. It's about Shoko Nishimiya, who is absent today. The truth is, we received a call from Nishimiya-san's mother yesterday. Eight of Nishimiya-san's hearing aids have going missing... ...or have been damaged within the past five months. Nishimiya-san's mother believes she may be being bullied at school. Has anyone seen Nishimiya-san getting... ...bullied or being harassed? Hearing aids are very expensive. Before you cause trouble for your parents... Ishida! We all know it's you. Hurry up and stand up! Yes, sir! Ueno. You sit next to him. What did you see? I guess he did kind of tease her. What? How about you, Shimada? Well, I also did tell him to knock it off. Not that Shoya listened. Shimada, you were doing it with me! The girls were bad-mouthing her too! Yeah, especially Ueno and Kawai! That's so mean... I would never do such a thing. Why? That's just mean, Ishida-kun. Notebook for Conversations Shoko Nishimiya Why... Good luck on your own. Moron. Yes, yes. I'm very sorry for the trouble. Yes, yes. Goodbye. Shoya. Shoya, wait! Shoya! Your teacher told me everything. Why are you all wet? Shut up! I jumped into the river like always! Hold it! Have you caused trouble for anyone? I don't know. Is what the teacher said true? Yeah, it's the truth! We're going to Nishimiya-san's place, so get ready. Mizuho Bank Sho-chan, let's go home. You be a good boy starting tomorrow. Okay? These so-called great men... ...were struggling in many ways. Shoya Ishida What are you doing? What are you doing at my desk?! What were you doing, you creep! There's that face again. Don't pretend to be a goody two-shoes! What is it!? If you got something to say, then say it! You always make a weird face! You're pissed off, right!? Say it! What did you do that for? What is it?! What? I'm doing the best I can! What are you saying?! What is it?! I don't understand what you're saying! Ishida-kun. Go away. She really pisses me off. Nishimiya-san transferred to another school. All right, then. Who was the class helper of the day for yesterday? The class journal wasn't handed in. And who was on duty to take care of the flowers? Sign Language Learning Class. Hi there, Shoko-chan. Nishimiya! Do you remember me from when we were in the 6th grade? I'm Shoya Ishida. Nishimiya?! Wait! Nishimiya! Nishimiya! Hey. I came here to give this to you. You forgot this. Why do I know sign language? Because I learned it. Here you go. You might not really want to see it but... Can me... ...and you, Nishimiya... Can we be friends? What am I saying?! I mean, that's what you were saying back then, right? I finally got what she meant! Don't cry. Don't cry, Nishimiya. Will you be friends with me? Sho-tan! Sho-tan! Sho-tan! Wake up! Breakfast! Sho-chan, wake up! Good morning, Maria. Sho-tan woke up! I'm heading out! -Goodbye, Mom! -Bye! Here you go, Sho-chan. Thanks for the meal. Dig in. What are you grinning about? Because... You're working hard at your part-time job. You even sold your comic books, clothes, and futon. I appreciate your thought. By the way, Sho-chan... Why did you try to kill yourself? I've just been through a lot of stuff. But, what should I say... I knew it. I knew it! I knew something was up! Your room is unusually clean, and your phone is off! On top of that, what's that ominous calendar? All the pages after April are ripped off. Unless you promise me you're not going to kill yourself, I'm gonna burn this! The 1,700,000 yen that you earned with your sweat and tears! Hey, are you even listening to me?! -Don't be stupid. -You're the one who's stupid! -Are you trying to kill your poor mother?! -Sorry! I'm really sorry. I'll stop. I'm sorry! Seriously! What are you going to stop?! Tell me! I'll stop trying to kill myself! I'll stop trying to kill myself! Do you mean it? I mean it! That's a promise, okay? Mom! It's hot! Water! Yesterday, I was going to jump off of a really tall bridge and kill myself. I went to see Nishimiya as a formality. It was the greatest test of courage ever. That's what it was supposed to be. Friends. What am I saying! Shimada said this on the first day of Junior High. You guys better stay away from that Shoya Ishida. He's a bully. What comes around goes around. I realized I need to bear the sins, and need to be punished for it. And... I ended up alone. Make sure to translate this by next class. -Ishida-kun. -Yes. Kawai. Have you handed in your math notebook yet? Oh, sorry, I forgot. Okay. Make sure to hand it in soon. -Sorry. -Yup. Should we go to the courtyard? Ishida-kun is always alone, just like that. It's famous. Everyone knows. Seriously?! He's looking over here again. I wonder if he gets lonely being alone all the time. For the rest of his life... Why is he alive? I bought this on the first day that it came out. I'm going to quit being their fan from today. Me too. Yeah, right. Over here! Pass to me! I've seen that head before. Who was that? Never mind that, but... Can I go and see Nishimiya again? She said she feeds the carp bread. A person like me, how dare I'd show my face... Then, is it okay to apologize for making her cry? She did say she's there every Tuesday. Will it be creepy? I'm home. Sho-chan! You scared me! What is it? I'm sorry about this morning... ...that I burnt the money you've worked hard for. But... Who wants to use money you saved in order to die anyway? Sorry, I'll earn the money again. Thank you. But you can take your time with it, okay? You must be hungry. Let's make dinner. Tummy! Tuesday. Hey, can I borrow your bicycle? Me? What for? The guy from before. I forgot something! I want to go get it! Huh? Who are you? Can't you use your own bicycle? I'm asking you because I don't have one! Please stop it. -Let it go! -Stop it! Someone help! Somebody! Please help me! Shut up! Let go of your hand! Want to borrow mine? For real? You are a god. It was stolen. Of all days, today is a Tuesday. Does this mean I shouldn't go meet her? It's not like I can't walk there but... It's like I'm being told not to go. I need to find a reason. Coupon. New fluffy bread for sale. I want to find a smart and natural reason. New fluffy bread? This is it! Is Nishimiya-san here? She's not here. She is here. She's not here. Shoko Nishimiya is not here. Excuse me, but... Are you really her friend? Goodbye, then. It was nothing. It was just a rat. A really gross one. It's all right. He won't be coming anymore. Friends. How come...? Oh, there you are. Ishida-kun! Look! This is your bicycle, right? Good timing! It was good that it had your address on it. Where did you find this? It was abandoned in the rice field. I looked for it all over the place. I'm so glad I got it back to you. What's wrong, Ishida-kun? What's your name? It's Nagatsuka. I sit behind you... Oh, yeah. It's good bread. Do you want some, Nagatsuka-kun? Ishida-kun! Ishida-kun! Good morning. Morning. Ishida-kun. Do you want to hang out after school? Since we are friends now. Ishida-kun, over here! What's wrong, Ya-sho? It's nothing. What's Ya-sho? -It sounds really friendly right? -Yeah. So...is something on your mind? You can tell me anything. We're best friends. Hey, Nagatsuka-kun. What does it mean to be "friends"? Like, is there some sort of right to become friends? Or like qualifications? Hey, Ya-sho. Give me your palm. Come on. This is what friends are. Ishida-kun, I think... ...friendship lies somewhere beyond things like words and logic. You don't need such things as qualifications. That's ridiculous. She's not here. -She is here. -No, she's not. I'm going out with Shoko. Oh, that's a bummer. Not about me, about the bread. But... I didn't know that Nishimiya liked younger guys. Kind of surprising. Here, can I at least give you the bread? It's good bread. If you're only here to satisfy yourself, then please leave. Now, if you'll excuse me... Goodbye. Hey, boy...! My friend here said he wants to see Nishimiya-san! -Nagatsuka-kun. -Stop complaining and bring her here! Why are you here, Nagatsuka-kun? I followed you. Isn't that what best friends are for? So the turd's friend is a turd-head, huh? You piece of crap. Who do you think you are? Say that one more time! Turd-head, turd-head, turd-head! Oh, dear, what's the matter? Isn't that Yuzuru-chan? They're fighting. Nagatsuka-kun! -Stop it! -Take that back! Nagatsuka-kun, that's enough. Let's go. Aren't you the boy from the other day? That's not me. Sorry, Nagatsuka-kun! Oh, crap! Damn it, he got to see her. Good for you, Ishida-kun! Hey, boy, are you eavesdropping on them? Let me see it too! Ishida-kun is moving his hands around. It's probably sign language. What!? Wow. I didn't know he had that special skill. Do you understand sign language? Translate their conversation! Who was that turd-head just now? I don't know him at all. Gross! Stop screwing around! Let me go! Don't fall, boy. The truth is, I wasn't sure if it was okay for me to see you. For the past two weeks, I've been thinking about... ...what it means to be friends. The reason for me to see you. I was looking for that. Ishida-kun. I'm glad. I was thinking about the same thing. That's so strange. Nishimiya, here's the bread for the carp. Do you enjoy feeding them? Oh, that's right. Actually, maybe you shouldn't look at that too much, Nishimiya. Wait, Nishimiya! She fell! Did something happen to Ishida-kun? Hey, boy! Nishida-kun's in the river! Why?! Ouch! What did you do that for! What is that?! Nishimiya. Nishimiya! I'm sorry that I dropped it. You're such a moron, Shoko. Moron. Have you seen this? What is this? Isn't this Ishida-kun? See you again. I can see her again? Hey. Ishida-kun, this is you, right? What is this? Ishida-kun. Come to the faculty office. Shoya Ishida. Suspended for one week. I jumped into the river... ...from the Suimonbashi bridge even though it's prohibited... ...and posted that photo online. -Shoya? -Yeah? Sorry, but... Can you go and pick up Maria? I'm not supposed to leave home during the suspension. It'll only be for little bit. -Thanks. -Wait! Really? We gotta leave soon, Maria! Sho-tan! There's someone there! Hey. Hey! Are you okay? Aren't you Nishimiya's boyfriend? You're going to catch a cold. Oh, it's the rat. What are you doing at a place like this? Where are your shoes? Aren't you angry? About what? I'm the one who posted your photo online. Oh, that was you? I see. I'm glad it was you. What do you mean? I have some idea about why you did it. Get angry. No, I can't. I brought it upon myself. Sho-tan, I'm hungry! Al right! I gotta go. You should go home soon too. You have a kid? She's my sister's! Hey! Here you go, Yuzuru-kun. Dig in! Where's sis? She's going to be late tonight. Maria, is it too hot? It's tasty! Yuzuru-kun, aren't you going to eat? Yuzuru-kun. Say "Ah!" Bon appétit! Damn it. What are you doing? I got worried because you disappeared suddenly. Here, take this umbrella. Just hold it! Just hold it, please. Thanks. Oh, yeah, here we go. Do you want to wear these? I used to wear them, but I don't anymore so... They're yours. Why did you leave home? I got into a fight with Shoko. Oh, is it because it gets complicated when you guys are in a relationship? I used Shoko's shampoo without permission. She said that she doesn't need me. You guys live together? Hold up the umbrella for yourself. There's only one right? But it was me who didn't get the right number of umbrellas. I'll feel bad for Nishimiya if you catch a cold. By the way... Who do you think you are? Are you a hypocrite? Do you feel good by taking in a stray cat? You were just amused by it, right? You were amused just because she's deaf, right? And even if you learned sign language now... Do you think you became a good person or something? You creep me out. Right. I guess Nishimiya told you, huh? You're right. I'm a horrible human being. I shouldn't be living. But at least... I just don't want to make Nishimiya cry anymore. I don't mean to come between you guys. That won't happen. But.. this is also about myself. -This is far enough. -Okay. Oh, yeah. I'm so sorry that I made you believe otherwise but... I'm Shoko's... -Younger sister!? -See you! Nishimiya san's mom. Let's go. That hurts. I'm sorry. I'm home. Yujuwu! Sis, you'll get wet. I'm sorry too. Can I drink your Shiso juice, granny? Yuzuru. Don't get involved with a person like that. Tell that to Shoko too. I'll decide that on my own. Sis too. Hey, boy! How have you been? What are you doing here today? I'm here to return the umbrella I borrowed. You're actually a pretty good kid, huh? Nakatsuka-kun, that kid is not a boy. She's Nishimiya's younger sister. I knew that anyway. Thank you for always looking after my Ya-sho. He's my friend, Nagatsuka. I got a new cell phone. You have a cell phone too, right, Nishimiya? Do you text... ...with friends from your current school? That's great! Do you have anyone else who you want to be texting with? Someone who you want to know the address of? Should I give you mine? Sa-ha-ra. Sahara-san from elementary school? Ya-sho. So, are you going to go meet this person, Sahara-san? No, that's not really true. But I think you're very responsible, Kawai-san. Kawai-san? -Ya-sho? -But Mashiba-kun... Kawai-san. What is it? I have something I want to ask. Do you know how to get in touch with Sahara-san who... ...went to the same elementary school with us? Sahara-san? Sorry, I don't know. But the school will know. Nao goes to the same school. Tat yo Girls Academy. -I'm running low on cash. -Ishida-kun. Use this. What's this? I don't need that much. Don't worry about it, Ya-sho. Once you factor in travel, meal, and love hotel expenses... ...won't you feel better to have a little extra? Hey! We're here. Sis says she's pissed she was being left behind even though it's about her. Sorry, but can you take her with you, Ishida? Are you tired? I got your e-mail address from Yuzuru. Thank you for today. It made me very happy to hear that you were looking for Sahara-san. I hear a lot about you from Yuzuru. Thank you in advance! Tat you joshi gakuenmae (Tat yo Girls Academy) If we walk from here... Sho-chan?! -Sorry! -Sho-chan! I'm... ...Sahara. Do you remember me? Hey! Ishida-kun? Long time no see. Isn't it? I've been studying since then. Was that right? I'm sorry for disappearing on you... ...like that. I've always had you on my mind, Sho-chan. I'm glad we were able to meet. I was so surprised! Really? What kind of high school are you attending, Sho-chan? Your chest has gotten bigger. I wonder what your cup size is. I'll check for myself! What's wrong? Nothing, I'm just going to the bathroom. Okay. Here's a coupon. Here you go. Here's a coupon -Ueno... -Here's a coupon. Please come and visit. Meow Meow Club 30% off Meow Meow Club. It's Sahara! I'm impressed that you learned sign language! Thanks for bringing us together! Wow, Sahara. It's not something I can do. Might as well have Ueno meet Nishimiya too? Obviously, no. I think so too. Okay, should we go in, Nagatsuka-kun? Let's go to the Meow Meow Club. -Welcome -Oh... How long will you be staying for? An hour. -With this coupon. -Seriously? That'll do nicely. Crap, he really came. I don't know what to say... What were you expecting? What about you? Don't be stupid. I just purely wanted to come and meet your friend. Yeah, your friend. Is she here? She's not exactly a friend. Meaning? A lot happened when we were in the 6th grade. To be honest, it's really awkward. I guess she's not here. Should we go home? Audiometry Laboratory A bug! Oh, you're here, huh? I'm here to play with Maria. Do you think Nishimiya will use this? A cat! Hey, sis, I'm coming in. Sis...? I'll leave your souvenir here. Ueno-san? Go! Go! -What? -Long time no see. Long time no see. Isn't that Nishimiya? She's still alone. Poor her. By the way, Ishida. It really has been a long time! Let's hang out soon! -No, thanks. -Ishida. You hate me, don't you? Not really. I've... ...always thought I should have talked to you. I'm sorry about what happened in elementary school. Ueno, get off. That's a pouch from our cafe. That's scary. Why does she have it? I gave that to her. Oh, really. See you. Al right. -Ueno! -Nishimiya-san! Long time no see! How have you been? What? There's only one? Ueno, what are you doing? I'm going to toss it around for fun, like we used to do. I'm sorry, Nishimiya. No way! You gotta be kidding me, Ishida! Wait. Are you guys going out? There's no way. We're friends. Friends? That's hilarious. You're friends with someone who you used to bully? Why? That's crazy! No way! Is it because of guilt or something? No. What the heck has gotten into you, Ishida? Well, just keep having your pretend-friendship. You're asking what we were talking about? It was nothing. I should get going. See you later. Yujuwu. It's morning. I'm awake because I'm so surprised. It's breakfast. Wait a minute! What's going on? Sis. Why do you have your hair in a ponytail? There's something going on. I gotta show this to Ishida. Mass carp spawning. You have to come feed them. From: Yuzuru. Nishimiya. She's wearing a ponytail. Where are you going, Ishida-kun? Where am I going? To the bakery. Yuzuru asked me to get food for the carp. She's supposed to have some already, Yuzuru just wants to eat it. Wait, Nishimiya. You don't have to buy any bread. Use sign language. -Is my voice weird? -Yeah. I'm sorry! It's totally okay. I gotta go get bread. See you later. Nishimiya? You're giving this to me? Thanks. Can I open it? I wonder what this is. Thanks. What? Is it something about this? I love you! The moon? It is pretty, isn't it? Nishimiya? Hey! Are you free? Let's go for a movie! From your big friend, Nagatsuka. Hey, Nagatsuka-kun. Do you think these look like the moon? No, they don't look like the moon. -Candy? -It doesn't seem like they're candies. Nishimiya gave me these but... I really don't know what they are. Did something happen? I told Ishida-kun that I like him. Are you kidding me??! But he didn't understand me. You've changed your hairstyle. Why did you change it? Did something happen? It looks really good! Cut it out, everyone. I just didn't have time this morning. -But it looks good. -Kawai-san. Why did you change your hairstyle? Why? I don't have any special reason. Girls are just like that. I see. What? Mashiba-kun said the other day... ...he wants to be friends with you, Ishida-kun. Why are you here? Nice to meet you, I'm Sahara. Hi, I'm Mashiba. Hey, stop doing that over my head! Miyo-chan, it's been so long! Where's Nishimiya today? She went home because she had a stomachache. - I wonder if I'm being avoided. -How come? I couldn't understand what Nishimiya was trying to say the other day. What did she say? The moon. It's such an easy word. I couldn't understand her. She must have gotten so annoyed. Well, if you're worried that she's avoiding you, why don't you ask her out? She'll say no if she doesn't want to go. True. A few of us are making plans to hang out. Do you want to come with us? From: Shoya. Let's get in line for that one, everyone! Try to keep up so you don't get separated from the group! -Why is that girl taking charge? - I don't know. Ishida... Who is that person? She seems familiar. Ueno...why is she here? -Is she a friend of Shoko's? -Oh...Yeah... From elementary school. -Can I sit here, Sahara-san? -Yeah, sure. I wonder if it's going to be scary. Is everybody ready? Here we go! Sahara-san, was everything okay between you and Ueno? Yeah, we're in the same school, and in the same design department. I learned a lot from Nao-chan's taste. When I was in elementary school, I used to be too scared to ride this. Because I was a coward. But I started looking at things a little differently. I figure I'll wait until after I ride it to decide whether it's scary or not. It's still scary though. Here it comes! Oh, dear! Sho-chan, your legs are shaking! Are you okay? That's impressive! You know sign language? You must have worked hard to learn sign language, Ishida-kun. Get your hand off! -You're being rude to my Ya-sho! -Huh? I was just being friendly. No, you can't! Don't be so naive! Nagatsuka-kun, you're hilarious. You need my permission to go near Ya-sho. Nagatsuka-kun, is your hair real? Stop it! Faster, Mashiba-kun! Go! Ya-sho, go! Is it okay... ...for me to have this much fun? But this feels like... What are you doing?! It's like... ...we're friends! -Ishida. -Huh? I want to eat takoyaki. Let's go buy it together. Wait...! Here is your takoyaki. -Thanks. -Ueno. You should mind your own business. Shi... Shimada... Wait, Ishida! Sorry, I'll text you later! Ishida! Are you mad at me? No, I'm not. I'm not mad. I just thought you guys could be friends again like before. I thought it'd be okay once you guys met. Mind your own business. Wait, I did the same thing. You and me are kind of the same. No, we're not. We are. We're not alike. If only Nishimiya-san hadn't shown up, we all would have been happy. Don't assume that. But that's the truth, isn't it? If it wasn't for her... There would have been nothing to get between Sahara and me. Things wouldn't have gotten ruined between Ishida and Shimada. I want to go back to how things were before Nishimiya-san came. Me and Shimada... I ruined that all on my own. Do you hate me, Ishida? Probably. I think I want to ride the Ferris wheel. -I'll go ride it with Nishimiya-san. -Hey! Nishimiya-san, come ride the Ferris wheel with me. Ueno! Sis, take this with you. I'm going to ride the roller coaster again. Yuzuru-chan, welcome. Shoya's upstairs. I have a top secret video. A video of the ferris wheel? That's right. -What do you mean? -Stolen footage. What?! Listen. I hate you. Let's not use that. I'll speak slow so you can understand... ...and I'll listen to you carefully. Back in elementary school... ...I didn't understand you nearly well enough. But you didn't try to understand me either. So instead of getting a clue, you gave me your stupid notebook. You were always acting weird. When something happened, you just apologized straight away. That's why I changed how I did things. 1 ignored you and talked about you behind your back. That was a sign telling you not to come near me anymore. But you didn't get it, and you just got back at me... ...by telling the adults. As a result, that's how Ishida lost friends. So many things got ruined around us. I'm sorry. I don't even want you to apologize. We were both desperate back then. Looking back now, I don't think we could have done anything about it. Burt... I don't mean to say that we should be friends after all this time. I still hate you... ...and you hate me too. So why don't we coexist peacefully? Between people who hate each other... Let's shake on it. I don't hate you. I hate myself. What was that? What is that! Now what? Are you gonna say sorry again? Just like five years ago, you have no intention of talking to me! What do you think? I want Nishimiya to like herself. Ueno-san, right? Yeah, Ueno. Did something happen between her and Nishimiya-san? Why? Kawai-san said a lot happened in elementary school. Nishimiya-san really can't hear, can she. -Yeah. -Hey, maybe. Is that why she got bullied? I can't stand that... ...stuff like that. Right, Ishida-kun? What do you mean? Are you saying I'm spreading stories about what happened in the past? You're being loud. Ishida-kun, you haven't changed at all in the end. You've always done horrible things since elementary school. -What's wrong? -Calm down, Kawai-san. What's going on? Mashiba-kun, Ishida-kun used to... ...bully a certain girl. What are you talking about, Kawai-san. That can't be... It's the truth! You used to say bad things behind her back too. I never said bad things behind Nishimiya-san's back. -Nishimiya-san? -That's right. Ishida-kun used to bully Nishimiya-san. I did try to stop Ishida-kun. But Ishida-kun didn't listen. I was really scared. Ya-sho. -Are you okay? -Sorry, Nagatsuka-kun. Ya-sho. Ya-sho! I hate myself too. Hey, Ishida! What's wrong? It's nothing. Really. There he is. I brought your bag. -Hey. -Nao-chan! I called her here. I'm sorry about before. But... It was originally Ishida-kun's fault though. But... Mashiba-kun said I should forgive you if you apologize to Nishimiya-san. Wait a minute. That's wrong, don't you think? We don't have any right to blame Ishida about that! We...? You're wrong, Nao-chan. About what? Unlike me, you actively bullied Nishimiya-san. Don't lump me in with you. Nao-chan. Yeah, we are different. Completely different. Unlike you who only laughed and went along with it! -How dare you! -What do you think, Sahara? Me? Nao-chan used to talk behind Sahara-san's back a lot too! I only say what's true! So, what do you think Sahara?! I... Back then, I was... ...scared of both of you. Which side are you on?! I'm not on anyone's side. Stop it. It's all... ...my fault. I hate that kind of logic. Ueno... Don't just selfishly assume everything. Ishida-kun, you don't have to put it like that. Stop it, Sahara. You're just going to run away again and regret it. That you're a coward. What's gotten into you, Ishida-kun? Kawai, stop talking. You've just always adored yourself. Ya-sho. I'm on your side. Stop saying you're on my side when you barely know me. I can't take this anymore. I'm going homel! Ya-sho. It's okay. I'm not bothered by it. Sho-chan. See you later. Sorry, Ishida. I shouldn't have come. Ishida-kun, that was way too mean. Outsiders shouldn't be able to interrupt. I thought we were friends. Oh, that reminds me. It's summer vacation from next week, right? Do you want to go somewhere.? I don't know. Are you even listening? Yuzu. You're going to ruin your eyes reading in the dark. Here. Are you still worried about your sister, Yuzu? Granny's worried about you, Yuzuru. You worry so much about your sister... ...that you end up neglecting yourself. You're not any different, granny. Instead of going to the senior center, you just study sign language all the time. I'm doing it for myself, so that doesn't count. I'm doing it for myself too, then. Is that so? Yuzu, you're a good kid. You think so? I get told off by Mom every day. I haven't gone to school for a long time either. You have a pure heart, Yuzu. Shoko is doing her best too. I've got some mighty fine grandchildren. Eat the manju too. [ Will. Granny. Hey, Nishimiya. How are you? I was able to get really good bread today. This bread... ...is good bread just like you. So... That doesn't make sense. Is she not coming today? Is her stomach hurting again? I guess that'll be weird to ask. Hey, Yuzu. I guess I should go. Ishida. -Hey. -What is it that you're wearing? What do you mean? It's my uniform. -How do you like it? -How come...? It's for school. Isn't it summer right now? So what's really going on? Nothing in particular. If anyone asks, it's a cosplay? That was from my sis. I gotta go. Where to? I'll walk you there. No, it's fine. I'll walk you there. Seriously, It's fine. You were crying before, weren't you? How come? It doesn't have anything to do with you, Ishida. It does. I would like to think so. Why? I'm worried about you, Yuzuru. Don't say something that my granny would say. Then tag along for all I care. Thanks, Ishida. This is far enough. Funeral: Ita Nishimiya See you. Good luck, Yuzuru. Ishida. Actually, I'm scared. Dear Nishimiya Do you want to go somewhere tomorrow? Wow. Nishimiya, let's go and see. Nishimiya? It's nothing...! Why are you apologizing? That's not true. Hey, Nishimiya, how about tomorrow? Let's hang out tomorrow too, Nishimiya. Nishimiya said that I'll be unhappy if I'm with her. I'm the one who made her unhappy. Wanting to see the sea And somebody to love me Even monsters... ...have a heart... I feel like there's no way to recover from this. Nishimiya! Hey! Yuzuru is here too today, huh? Let's go to the movies! This is hilarious! Hey! I've decided to come! This summer is a lot of fun! -Right, Yuzuru? -I don't know. It's so satisfying. Seriously! Nishimiya, where should we go tomorrow? Let's go somewhere tomorrow. No, we have plans tomorrow. -Are you serious sis?! -She wants to make a what? Is this okay? Is it okay that I'm here? Your mission is to bake our mother's birthday cake. Are you sure that'll be okay? Am I going to get slapped again? She might kill you. For real? That looks good! What are you doing? What is he doing here, Shoko? What is the meaning of this? -Go home. -Wait, Mom. Come on, it's a celebration. Yuzuru. It looks good on you. So good! You managed to not get killed, huh, Ishida? We did it, sis! By the way, Yuzuru. I sent some of your photos to the prefectural contest. -You did what? -Sho-chan wanted to submit it. I was just messing around with the camera! That's not really true. Both of you, really. Oh yeah, Ishida, it's the fireworks display next Tuesday. I don't have to go. Let's go. -Is here okay? -Yeah. I'm going to go buy yakisoba. Come with me. Thanks. Thanks for inviting me to your house the other day. Your mom... Yeah? Do you think she was happy? She was mostly expressionless. When is your birthday? June 7th? It's already passed! You're already 18, huh? Let's celebrate it together next year, okay? Oh no, I said "together." Oh, that's right. I got it. I get it now. What's wrong? The fireworks aren't over yet. To study? Okay. I'll walk you home. But... Okay. See you later, then. Where's sis? Oh, yeah, can you go and get the camera? Is anyone here? Boy, it's dark. Nishimiya? I'm coming in. Is it charged? You can see the fireworks from here. Nishimiya, you're here. Nishimiya...? Wait. What are you doing? Nishimiya? Nishimiya. Nishimiya! Nishimiya?! Shoko! Why, Nishimiya... Nishimiya, hold on to the railing. Please, God... ...give me one more ounce of strength. I won't run from things I don't like anymore. Starting tomorrow... ...I'll look everyone in their face properly. Starting tomorrow... ...I'll listen to everyone's voice properly. Starting tomorrow... ...I'll do things right. The scar I gave her that time... Did I ever apologize properly for that? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Nishimiya. Are you still angry? What did I do? I should have asked Nishimiya what she thinks of me. By the way Nishimiya, I... Sho-chan. Your sister made pancakes. I'm going to watch the fireworks. It's cold. It's warm. Suimon Municipal Hospital Ma'am. Hi, Yuzuru-chan. I finally got to see you. I tried calling your store, but it was closed. I was told no visitations are allowed. That's okay now. He moved to another room today. Let's go together. Come see him. Ma'am, is Sho... Ishida-san. Nishimiya-san. Nishimiya-san, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for troubling you like this again. I'm very sorry. Please, stop it! My son must have done something to Shoko-san again. -Otherwise... -Ma'am... Ishida rescued my stupid sister. This is all due to my own mismanagement. I'm sorry. Please. Please raise your heads. I'm glad Shoko-chan was okay. And Yuzuru-chan too. Please. Why is Ishida hurt instead of you?! Don't pretend to be the tragic heroine! Say something! "I troubled everyone... ...and felt so hurt." So you thought you would kill yourself. "I'm sorry"? Who do you think you are?! Nishimiya, you're a blight! People like you who only think in their head piss me off the most! Who the hell are you?! Are you Nishimiya's mother!? If you can't keep your kid in line... -...don't have kids to begin with! -What are you doing? Stop it. Cut it out! Why?! What are you doing? Shoko-san. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What are you doing? If she saw these... ...I thought she would stop saying that she wanted to kill herself What should I have done? It's being held shut from the inside! Oh, Nishimiya-san, I didn't see you there. Why don't we go over there? I'll buy you a drink. Hospital Room 400-417 I heard what happened with Ya-sho. I've destroyed what Ishida-kun worked hard to create. Are you talking about what happened on the bridge? Ya-sho accepted a guy like me. For the first time, I've learned what best friends are supposed to be. Ya-sho is my big friend. He has to wake up. I want to restore what I destroyed. You wanted to die because you were suffering?! What's gotten into you?! Kawai-san, you're being loud. You have to say it loud for Nishimiya-san to hear. Everyone was worried about you! Everyone suffers in their life. But it's like that for everyone, right? So... ...you have to love the bad parts of yourself too, and move forward. I'm glad you were okay. I want to restore what I destroyed. I see. You went to see everyone. That's amazing. I don't have enough confidence. Even if Ishida-kun wakes up... ...I'm ashamed to see him. I couldn't change. I couldn't protect you again. I was the same coward. You can change from now on. Sahara-san. Thanks for coming. -Wah!! -Cut it out! Nishimiya. I found you. How are you? Um... It's kind of awkward. (Laugh) I'm... ...thinking about dying. Oh. Tuesday is going to end soon. See ya. Nishimiya. Nishimiya? What is this? Mom? What is this?! Nishimiya. Nishimiya. Nishimiya. Nishimiya. Nishimiya. Hey. Are you okay? I'm glad... ...you're okay. Nishimiya... ...I'm fine now. More or less. So, don't make that face... ...Nishimiya. Oh, yeah. Nishimiya-san. I'm sorry. I never really apologized for what happened in the past... ...and for everything that happened later on. I think I... ...understood you in ways that were convenient for me. I wanted to talk more... ...with you. That was all I think. But... ...I hurt you, and as a result... ...it led to you making the worst choice. That's wrong! I didn't change. That's why... ...you fell. It's all... ...my fault. I thought if I just disappear... I'm sorry! Don't cry, Nishimiya. Hey, Nishimiya. I was talking to you until just a little bit ago. In my dream... ...I guess I was thinking of giving up on a lot of things. But I was wrong. I always thought about the same thing as you Nishimiya, but... ...still... I realized that it still wasn't worth dying over. I want to apologize properly to everyone too. Nishimiya, I... I want you to... ...help me... .live. Nishimiya. I just did someting creepy. Oh, crap, I'm sorry. Forget about that Nishimiya. We have arrived at your destination, sir. Hey, Maria, you've been giving water to the flowers? You're such a good kid! You're here! Maria, Sho-chan came back to life. I never died, Maria. That must be Ueno-san. She was taking care of you the whole time. You should thank her. I heard you came to visit me. I'm good-for-nothing. Even in this kind of situation. I just couldn't come to like Nishimiya-san. I probably shouldn't say, but... When you fell into the river, Shimada and the guys pulled you out. They said not to tell you but... Ishida... Welcome back. I'm gonna get going. Thanks. Isn't that too short? It's cuter like this. Hey, Sho-chan. Hello. Welcome. Ishida-kun. I'm sorry. Oh. Me too. My son is invincible. Mom, I'm going to go pick up Maria. Okay! He's married to my older daughter, he just came back. Sho-chan. Yuzu-chan is upstairs. Give her the jello that's in the fridge. Hey. Winter uniform? -Looks good on you. -Look at this, Ishida. Wow, seriously? That's impressive! Look at this too. Wow, this is amazing too. Teach me how to study, please. Sure. So you started going to school, huh? Shoko created the chance for me. I thought I'd give it a try. I don't want to disappoint anyone. The school festival starts tomorrow. Yeah, that's right. Everyone is going to the school festival tomorrow. I'll wait for you at the front gate at 10am. From: Shoko. Good morning, everyone. How have you been? I'm sorry that I've said those horrible things. Okay! -I'm heading out! -Good luck! That's what those things were for! -What? -Nothing. See you later. Have a good day! Good morning. Shall we go, then? Welcome to the 45th Touchi High School Festival Isn't that Ishida? -Who is that? -The guy who was in the hospital, right? The guy who jumped? I've never mentioned this before but... ...I don't really fit in at school. I have trouble even looking everyone in the eyes. To tell you the truth, it's easier if I look down. It's okay if I look down? Nishimiya. I can walk normally, you know... Thanks, Nishimiya. This is my class. Has the water boiled? It'll take a little longer. Ishida-kun? Are you okay now? Nishimiya. I think my stomach hurts a little. Sorry. Ya-sho! Ya-sho? Nagatsuka-kun? Ya-sho, does your stomach hurt? Ya-sho! Hey Nagatsuka-kun, good morning. How have you been? -About the other day... -Ya-sho. Why are you looking down? That's weird. I actually came planning to face you guys a lot more head on. I guess I got scared. Hey, Ya-sho? Ishida-kun! I'm glad you're okay. If you... If you didn't wake up, everything for me was going to end. Ya-sho, don't worry about what happened on the bridge. Things like that happen all the time in life. So, please, Ya-sho... ...don't go anywhere far. Please! Nagatsuka-kun. Sorry. I'm so sorry. And thank you. Ya-sho. And what's with that moustache? It's for good luck... ...hoping for you to wake up fast. Nagatsuka-kun. What happened? We heard Nagatsuka-kun's voice calling Ishida-kun's name. I see. Kawai-san. We should give that to Ishida-kun, do you have it? I brought it, but we can't. It's a total failure. Why not? Let's give it to him. Here... We really wanted to get the full thousand, but we couldn't. I asked everyone but... No, it's amazing! This is plenty! I've never gotten anything like this before... ...80 I'm really happy! Seriously! Thank you, Kawai-san. And sorry. Mashiba-kun too. No, you're great. Gross! Pretend-friendship, huh? You're making my skin crawl. Why do you say it like that, Nao-chan?! What is it, Kawai? -Do you want to fight? -Come on, both of you! Ishida-kun. I'm sorry, Ishida-kun. Even when you were having a rough time... ...I couldn't change at all. No worries. I'm also... We're not talking about something that's that serious. You apologized again. I guess that's just who you are. You moron! Mo-ron. Mo-ron. I don't care. I'm going to go eat karaage. -She ran away. -She got embarrassed. I have a favor to ask of all of you. Is that okay? I want to check out the school festival with all of you. O-M-G, this is so good! Let's go to the gymnasium next. How can he come to school? -Their store is amazing! -Then let's go! Ah... When did I fall in love...? Turn around to face me, you'll see that I have always been right there. And so there's no need for tears. So my heart was broken, but I still remember all those moments we had. This red shall be the colour of confusion, you and I... This white shall be the corridor where we said goodbye. First and last and now, and ever more... Forever... Carved on these petals that fall, sent to you with my all. Darling... Mirrored in the puddles from the rain, around us. Nobody else in the world knows our truth. Ah, when did I fall in love? How many times have I cried myself to sleep at night. I number them, and I'm counting till the morning light. What can I do...? Tell me...] What I want to tell you stays the same, forever. Right from the start to the end, no way that we can can pretend Darling... If I've lost my way upon the road I'm walking There's just one sign that I need, to show the way home.
