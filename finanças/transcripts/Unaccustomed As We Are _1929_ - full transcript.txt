You've heard me speak about Stan. - Yes. - That's him. - Well, what about it? - Well... We were playing a little game of pool this afternoon and he got hungry and l told him about those big steaks that you cook and the strawberry souffle with the whipped cream beat up in it and that good coffee you make... And some nuts. Oh, l forgot to tell you. He likes nuts. He does? Well, isn't that something? - And l told him you'd fix something. - Oh, you did?

Why don't you do something to help me? - What can l do? - Set the table. That's simple. You don't have to use any brains for that. Hands off that! Go in the kitchen and light the oven. And pick your feet up. And take your hat off. Now go in and light the oven. Thank you. Got a match? Yes. l'll light it. You fix the table. Why don't you be careful? You might have blown the whole house up. You know, there's a right and wrong way to do everything. Light that again. Wait a minute. l didn't mean anything. l'm sorry l brought you here! What in the world is happening, Mr Hardy? Well, l was cooking dinner for my friend and l and we had a slight accident. Oh, you poor dear boy. Maybe there's something l could do to help you. That's awfully sweet of you, Mrs Kennedy. lt would be a pleasure, Mr Hardy. You're sure l'm not imposing, Mrs Kennedy? Oh, not at all, Mr Hardy.

Please put me out, Mr Hardy! Put me out! Ooh! Something to cover me up! - Are you hurt? - No, Mr Hardy. lt frightened me to death. l'm awfully sorry that happened, Mrs Kennedy. - lt's all right. Accidents will happen. - You're right, Mrs Kennedy. lt won't take me a minute to put on another dress. - You sure l can't help you? - No, thank you, Mr Hardy. My husband. lf he sees me, he'll kill all of us. What'll l do? Do? We'll tell him the truth. - The whole truth. - And nothing but the truth. - Absolutely. - Pardon. - My wife. What'll we do? - Tell her the truth. Shut up. Right in here. l don't know where to go. Close that door. ln the trunk. No, not you! Get up! Now keep your head down. - Oh, pussums. - What do you mean, pussums? Don't be cross. l'm sorry for what happened and l'll fix Stan dinner. Look. l brought him some nuts. - No, Barbara.

And l'm burning my bridges behind me. - Burning your what? - Burning my bridges. Oh. l thought you said breeches. But, Oliver, why are you leaving me? Because my friend advised me to go. - Come, Stan. - Oh. Just a minute. You wolf in sheep's clothing. lt's men about town like you that cause trouble between man and wife. What do you mean by taking this poor little innocent to South America and advising him to burn his bridges when he never even started a fire in his life? l'm talking to you. Answer me. What do you mean? Come on! Can't you answer? Oh! - You'd thrash me, would ya? - He wasn't gonna hit you. - You'd thrash me! - He wasn't gonna hit you. Hey! What's going on here? This worm is breaking up my happy home. He's taking my Oliver to South America. So you're the little home breaker, are you? l want to tell you something. This goes for you too, big boy. lf any guy ever tried to break up my home... l'd cut his throat. l think l'll have to be going. Wait a minute. Put that down. There's a woman in the case, huh? - Mrs Hardy? - Please don't. Now, now, now. Stop that crying. Stop that crying. l'm gonna take the boys outside and give 'em a good talking-to. You go into the kitchen and fix supper. l'll have 'em back in five minutes. Oh, thank you so much, Mr Kennedy. That's perfectly all right, Mrs Hardy. Hey! Here, here. You bozos take this trunk and put it in my apartment. What are we going to do? - What do we do? - Let's get outta here. Making whoopee, huh? lt's a great thing for you fellas that my wife isn't home. Say, listen, if you fellas are gonna take chances, you gotta be more careful. The big thing is to keep it as far away from your wife as you can. You fellas should go out on my beat with me some night. You'll appreciate my technique. We'll go over to the wife and l'll let that cluck outta the trunk and nobody will be any the wiser. Come on. We married men have gotta stick together. Here they are, Mrs Hardy. l bought 'em back just like l promised. l'll never forget you, Mr Kennedy. That's all right, Mrs Hardy. Any time you want peace, quiet, just give me a call. We're going to celebrate. l fixed your favourite dish. Oliver, you sit here and, Stan, you sit there. Come to papa. Stan, you serve the spaghetti while it's hot. l'll pour the coffee. Oliver loves coffee with his dinner. Oh, Oliver. Don't do that. Accidents will happen. Yes. l know that. Your dickie bird is waiting. - So dickie bird is waiting, is he? - You don't under... - You don't understand, dear... - l'm a cluck, am l? Listen. You get a bit of my technique, dearie. Oliver, you sit right down. That doesn't concern you in the least. Excuse me. Quit your crying! Close you eyes. Shut 'em! Good night, Mr Hardy.
