based on a true story - Be careful. - Hurry! Take your hands off her dress. She's exhausted. - Come back tomorrow! - Move back! Move back! Stay there! Stop! Who is she? My girl, 25 years old, and you still blush? Stop, daddy! Stop it! Put me down! Who were they? What did you say? Dad, what did you say to them? That's enough. On your feet! Stand up. Why are you always fixing to fight? I told them I'd found gold. The looks on their faces! Daddy! The Dancer You never understood him. Your accent's impossible. Verging on ridiculous. Don't waste your time. Go back to the others. It must be tiring, putting on an act every time. A little, but what of it? I'll be gentle. Stop this now. Fine. I won't try to fight you, your muscles put mine to shame. I bought that tapestry from an antique dealer in Paris. My very own Folies Bergère. That's where you should go to dance. They're avant-gardists. My dream's the Opera Ballet. What would you do surrounded by ballerinas in tutus? I'd dance. I'll dance wherever I'm wanted. This is beautiful. Could be good, coloured lights on my white dress. Red suits you. Don't play games. It's your act again? My jacket, please. You're cold? For a little extra lightness... Nice of you to drop by. What's wrong, dancer? I need to talk to you. It's important. I need help. You've seen my dance. Tell him. Louis, I need help and you say nothing. A dance is simply entertainment. I've nothing now. Me neither. You have an office. What use is it? I oversee my wife's affairs. Your wife's money pays for your whores and ether? I gave her my title. She owes me that much. I won't be long. Thank you What on earth's that? Auditions are Tuesday. My assistant will take your name. Clear? Stand aside now. Imagine with my lighting effects. Trouble is, my new dress is too small. - Bigger, it'll be beautiful. - How old are you? I'm 25. Dancers are famous at 20. Out! My sketches will help you understand. Wait! Look at my sketches. Look! Where did you pop up from? America. I tore my dress. Can I change somewhere, please? Are these yours? Sure. If you're hungry, there's a café opposite the Folies Bergère. Where all our artistes go. I'll talk to Mr. Marchand tomorrow. I must tell you, if he turns you down, you can't stay here. Follow me, nearly there. Folks, you need to hurry. There's no electricity yet on the top floor. Yes, our Japanese. - They didn't stay long. - Beautiful. Too avant-gardist for Marchand. Can I keep it? Yes, go ahead. I'll get a sewing kit for your dress. Thanks. How come she's still here? I don't know. Don't be ridiculous. Fine. Tomorrow, you can audition in public. We'll see. I can't. I'm not ready. I'll dance when I'm ready. I need more practice. I looked over her designs. They're technically sound. What are all these machines? Electric spotlights. Exactly. All that for a dance? And I need stagehands to hold the spotlights. I'll pay for technicians and lights, don't worry. Did you rob a bank? The lighting's important. It must be beautiful, surely? I sell a spectacle. People come for a good time. That's not bad already. For me, it's not good enough. Just a moment. You know how much it cost me, installing electricity here? What matters isn't the cost, Marchand. It's the return. Spare me the pigheaded look. You have two weeks. If it doesn't sell, I'll fire both of you. Fine by me. It's taking shape nicely. The technicians will need gloves so they don't burn their hands. You've added 30 black smocks. Yes, for them too. Can't we do without? It's important. So nobody sees them when I dance. I'll see what I can do. Tableau 1. Spotlight blue, positioned upstage left. Spotlight red, positioned upstage right. Centre stage, the dress is tossed over the head from front to back. 1, 2, 3, 4, red. 1, 2, 3, 4, yellow. We could go from 79 to 81 and add 4 panels. So when I raise my arms, it billows. 4 more, that's heavy! Going well? Fine. We had to dye the silk a touch darker. The white was far too white. In motion, how does it look? Careful, it's fragile. The fabric is very tricky to work with. We're not finished. I'll come back later. Red, yellow, blue, green! We need more silk. It works? Let me. I'll do it. The hands of an old woman. You have beautiful hands. Shall we go? Watch out! - Be careful! - Hurry! Take your hands off her dress. She's exhausted. - Come back tomorrow! - Move back! "A blossoming of dreams unfurls. "The flower's animated poem enchants. "Fleeting and mysterious. "We are left with hearts seized. "Transient beauty superior to life." And in today's Mercure de France, "Intoxicating art!" I'll get you another room. This one's stifling. Please, come in. Over here. Put those down there, thank you. Who's all that for? Me? "For the mysterious dream flower." That's you, isn't it? Extended run Sorry, I'm terrified. I can't do it. If they see me, it ruins everything. I'm sorry. You spent hours on your dress. You must meet your audience. The press is waiting. You're beautiful! They love my dance, not me. In the flesh, I'll disappoint them. Everybody's here. You go. I'm sorry. I planned to reimburse you. Still at war, I see. Even after victory. You're not hungry? My grandmother. The only picture I couldn't bear to sell. Emptiness is better than pointless furniture. American heiress and Count Dorsay to divorce I didn't mean to steal the show. Why does your divorce make headlines? Eat. Then we'll make love. It's the least you owe me. Only joking. You live in the dark like this? Not seeing scares me. Can I open the shutters? Be my guest. What's the height of the ceilings? I need space to work. I can pay you a rent, don't worry. I won't come alone, however. It's lifeless here. Faster, girls! Lasso! Very good. It has to dance. It's alive! Very good, really good. Tornado! Let me see the tornado! The wind! Blowing in every direction. It's huge! It's powerful! Reeds. Hands in the air! Ready... Frogs! Let me see frogs! And again! Great! Gabrielle, how long left? And again! Let's go! Happy birthday. Happy birthday, Gabrielle! Eat up or you'll fade away. - Where's Louis? - I have no idea. - Like it? - It's magnificent. Louis? I know you're in there. Open up. We're all outside, waiting for you. Open up, it's me! Give it to me. At the Opera, the dancers line up to curtsey after the show. You never take a bow. You're beautiful. So beautiful. My dear Marchand, allow me to introduce a good friend and intimate of the Dorsay family... You've met, haven't you? He knows who I am. You were breathtaking! Armand Duponchel, director of the Paris Opera. I'd be delighted to invite you to dance. With pleasure. Delighted to meet you. Please follow me. Isadora? She's replacing Jasmine. I'll take your bags. Anna, she just arrived. Can you find her a bed? Yes, of course. You sent the mirror plans to the Opera? Yes, and I asked for a backdrop for the Japanese. Those Japanese. Most beautiful thing I ever saw. They'll be a wonderful first act. Everybody will love them. I'll get ice for your back. Thank you. I'll lay down a while. Quiet, girls! - Welcome. - Good morning. - We'll show you to your dressing rooms. - Fine. - Where's Miss Fuller? - She's coming. Are you okay? It's only a theatre. Don't be overawed. You'll join me? Everybody's waiting. Art Nouveau at the Paris Opera! We're dragging this place into the new century. Champagne, waiter! No, I don't drink. At table, one removes one's coat. I feel the cold. I can't risk falling ill. Sorry, miss, there's a problem with one of your dancers. Excuse me. Absolutely scandalous. Sorry, I'll take care of it. That's enough now. Cover yourself up. It's another world. This is the Opera, not a travelling circus. Give them a chance. You're in no position to make demands. You sent specific plans. We agreed on 5 mirrors, now you want double that. It will be dazzling. But I'll need lamps with filaments at 50, not 30. Or the light won't be strong enough. My electrician says it's dangerous for you and the Opera. So I'm told every time, every show. It's too dangerous. It'll explode. People will burn alive, all because of me. I'm out of my mind, I know! - Thanks. - Go lie down. I'll look after the girls. It will be beautiful. I have no doubt. We're going home. Who'll pay for it? Your Japanese? Louis, what are you doing here? Get out! No, there's no room! Get out! It's boiling. Torturing yourself again. Your friend detested my Japanese. They're excellent, your Japanese. He didn't understand, that's all. It doesn't matter. Of course it matters. I'm sure he was delighted to see you dance. Careful. Beautiful, all these shades of blue. Stop, or I'll pee in the bath. She gave you this. She has grace, doesn't she? Simply transcendent. The girl knows what she's doing. For your signature... It's all settled. The Japanese leave tonight for Berlin. I gave them their money. There's not much left to cover the extra sets and lighting. Sign bottom right. The Opera certainly won't pay. They claim it's not in the contract. We'll have to manage. For the Opera, me alone isn't enough. It's not you alone. There are our little dancers. They're fine for the Folies Bergère. We need something more. You really believe in Isadora's talent? Draw up a contract for her. I want her on stage with me. She's perfect for the first act. Not so fast. We hardly know her. Organize a performance at the chateau theatre. Who for? Journalists? That's not like you. She's the dancer. This young girl really moves me... I'm here to introduce a young dancer named Isadora Duncan. Like me, she's American. Thank you all for coming. She'll be here shortly. You saw her? You think I was wrong? Answer me. Was I wrong? I doubt you'll find anyone to hurt you more. They're clapping! Hear that? Clapping. Go on, now. I can't. - Armand talked to you? - Yes. It's fine. You're sure about the dress? Isadora chose it. She insisted. And the hair? Ready... Hold still! Miss Duncan! A smile over here, please. Café de la Paix. A little closer. A few drops in each eye every day. That will help. Your neck muscles need rest. It's the weight of your costume. I'll order you a brace. I don't need one. I'm very strong. Up to a certain point. And those spotlights, can't you move them back? It's beautiful that way. Is it worth burning your eyes for? She dances at the Opera next week. That seems ill-advised. Drink water, not coffee. Keep to your bed. Is she your wife? I'll show you out. Make sure she looks after herself. Enough. Stop this now. Thank you. She can't go on. Your dancer can hardly stand. I'm risking my reputation. The light! Louis's father was one of our most generous benefactors. That's why she's here. Let's keep this to ourselves. We stop now. She's arrived. It turns out Miss Fuller has good taste. Without my dress, I'm nothing. Help me, Louis. Promise me you'll never leave me. Does the Opera intimidate you? Sorry. She forgot her shawl. Evening, can we buy you a drink? You're American? And the little lady? What are we drinking? For Miss Fuller. Fine, thank you. Put them down here. They're very beautiful. A message from Isadora. Read it to me. Well? What does she say? "I'll be back in return for a $10,000 contract." Why "I'll be back"? I think she's gone. I'll inform the Opera. We'll reimburse them. We'll find the money. You don't need her. We never needed her. Come on, girls. Let's do the photo. It'll be a great souvenir. Hold still. Here goes... Smile! Look at you. She's just a kid. I'm at my wits' end. Come on. - Stand up. - I'm too ashamed. You reek of alcohol. The bathroom, that way. What's this? It's hopeless. What are we going to do? We have to go. I'm ready. Can't keep my public waiting. Careful! I don't believe it. We'll cancel, don't worry. It doesn't matter. We have to go. Where's Louis? Come, won't you? Come! It's all off. I'll announce it. Take her back. She'll dance. She's a graceless lump. She's vulgar, like you! Nobody will remember her. I'm ready. You can do it. It will be beautiful. Open it. Open it. Let me see them! Let me see them. We received the patents, at last. Look through and sign them. It's all very official. They were my sketches. Thank you. A dream flower had sprung from the darkness. Subtitles: Simon John Subtitling: HIVENTY
