Miss. Please understand I don't know the man in the back. You know, women can think the person they're sharing a cab with is the driver's accomplice who will drag her to a deserted place and do things to her... I hope I haven't offended you, sir? HOBAK NIGHT CLUB Welcome, sir. Know why nightlife spots go up before any development takes off? Development's all about bribery and backdoor dealings. Are you from here? First trip in a long time, right? This place has long changed this way. Paju Meanwhile, the police, regarding the 5th Pan-National Rally, have taken in 2405 and arrested 5 for National Security Law offense. For the actively involved, a thorough investigation... 8 YEARS AGO Min-jae, I'm so sorry. I'm really sorry. Don't cry, stop crying. I'm sorry. Stop crying, stop. You're early. Mommy's here, mommy's here. You had fun with uncle Joong-shik, didn't you? Want to ride in this? Let's do that. Can't you act more civil? Huh? Can't you see I'm also a human being?! You do this every time you visit Doo-man in prison. I didn't see him. I just stood outside the building and left. It's your home phone number. Want me to make the call for you? It's been a while since you've last seen your mom. Stop, that's enough! There's no way mom would call my beeper. It's the cops out to get me! Are you trying to get me caught by announcing where I am? Please... Just this once, please? Just this once... Just this once... No! Oh my god! Hey! Uh? Joong-shik? What brings you here? Honey, Joong-shik's here. Let's go inside! You should've called. Go inside. - Great sermon. - Thank you. Okay, good bye, deaconess. Drive safely! - Hey, wake up! - No! Let's go home! Get up, okay? Get up! Let's go home! Shit, help us, mister! Get on my back, hey miss! Help us, mister! OK, OK... Can't you hold her right? Just get on my back, miss. Hey! I'll take you home! Why's everyone such a nag today? I said I can make it. I don't have an ulterior motive... - Hey mister! - Yes? I'm a Buddhist. I'd never get into a church van. Yeah, but... will be with you wherever you are and bless you by guiding you back home. To a secular man, this all seems so unfair. For a cheater who lied to his father and brother, leaving his loved ones with scars so profound to receive God's blessing instead of judgment. However, within this lies the Divine Providence. Hurry, hurry! Go, go! Check your betting ticket. Goodbye! - Welcome. - Check your betting ticket. - Hey, Eun-mo. - Huh? So you're refusing to go inside again? The bald guy on the first floor keeps yelling at me. Wasn't it great spending his deposit little by little? - You must be hungry. - Yeah! Hey, landladies! When're you returning my deposit? It's been four months! We've got to move soon. Your place's out on the market, but no inquiries yet... Who'd move here at your asking price? Besides, no one wants to live with the landladies. Take my advice and sell this place, so you can rent a room to live in! Yes, but our parents left this place to us... This overlapping part, would be 3 and 4, right? You all know that, right? What, too easy? - Sir! - Yeah? Tell us about your first love since it's raining and all... Yeah, tell us! - Why? Don't feel like studying? - No. Yeah, okay. It's no use studying on a day like this, right? She was my college senior. Now she's a mother. - She's two years older than me. - Wow, she's older than him! I was first attracted to her powerful voice during protests. Was she pretty? Yeah. Especially, her neckline was really beautiful. When she brushed her hair to one side, her long neckline and fuzz under her ears were exposed. Unbelievable! Tomorrow's Teacher's Day, right? Give this to your teacher. Why do you bother? A Teacher's Day present is the parents' responsibility. Or the guardian's. You're late. Yeah, I had a couple of drinks. Joong-shik! Yeah. Sit down. When are you returning to Seoul? You're off the wanted list. Besides, it's been over a year. I can't go back to Seoul. Then how about finishing your education here? If you're planning to stay in Paju, finish theological school and take over my pastoral duties. What? As well as the study group. I'm thinking of becoming a farmer. There's an opening in Namwon. Dae-yeon! I can't take over your church. I don't feel confident. What about the study group? I tend to say anything that comes out of my mouth. Things that I shouldn't say, things I can't say... TEACHER'S DAY I LOVE YOU JOONG-SHIK What're you doing? I love you Joong-shik! Do you find me pretty? Did you give your teacher my present? Present? Yeah, something much better than a necktie. What happened at the study group today? Did you see his face? He was really stunned. I want you both to stay put while I bring your teacher over! Awe, this sucks! I'm leaving. Hey! Why'd you do it? Stay away from my sister. Just leave her alone... I wish you could stay at my place. This place is just fine. My dad was furious when he heard you stole your college tuition and went to India. I just couldn't ask him. It's okay, you can use it as blinds or security bars. We worked hard today, so we deserve a little fun Yeah. HOBAK NIGHT CLUB You go up first. I need to get some money from the ATM. I couldn't find a bank nearby. It's okay. I have an idea. Hey gorgeous! I hate free-booze-drinking- rowdy customers who won't even cooperate when I book them a date. Call a friend to pay the bill! We don't have any friends. Fuck! You think this place is your playground? To come in and out free of charge! This way, sir Okay, then call your mom or dad. Hey, that's enough. Let them go. Hell no! We should hand them over to the police. Just let them go! This must be your lucky day. Are you okay? This fucking sucks... Did you sleep well? Yeah. We have to go somewhere. Where? There's an Anti-Demolition Task Force meeting here today. My dad's got to work, so he wants me to go instead. I guess this apartment site will be our fighting ground. - Well hello! - Hello! - Where's your dad? - He had to work. Is this seat empty? - Hey, let's gather around! - Okay. - Here. - Huh? What is it? Give it to the Task Force, okay? Bye! What's that? It's for the Task Force. My dad feels bad leaving for work. Eun-mo! Want to join me for dinner? Mi-ae told me about you. This place is the same. Your room's just like you left it. Things won't be stable with the demolition and all. But we'll be able to get along like we used to. Eun-mo! Three years ago... Why'd you do it? Because I was afraid. Of what? That I couldn't make it on my own. What about now? LEE, hey LEE! A little more to that side, right! Dong-shik, a little more that way! Do it right. Pull harder. - Is this right? - That's good. What about here? There too. Raise it a bit more. Good! Eun-mo! Uh, hello! It's been a while, hasn't it? Are you planning to live here, too? No, thought about it though. But not with this big bump. I'll have to move out. Did you see your brother-in-law? And visit your sister's gravesite? Yes. You'll be rich now. Don't you know? Didn't your brother-in-law tell you? Your sister took out a life insurance policy with your brother-in-law as the beneficiary. When they found out Eun-soo had died, they began an investigation on your brother-in-law. It just made everyone so uneasy... At first, I couldn't help being suspicious myself. I wasn't speaking too loud, was I? Let's get together sometime, okay? A little bit more, more! Raise it, raise it more! Let me see. CHOI Eun-soo... Born, 1971... here it is... The amount is $100,000. The beneficiary: CHOI Eun-mo Not KIM Joong-shik? It was changed once. At first it was her husband, KIM Joong-shik, and then changed to her younger sister. Uh? This is strange. How was the recipient changed when the policyholder had died? Can I look at the insurance investigation records? What for? Did your brother-in-law extort your money? It's not my job. The head office handles these matters directly. But I'll look into it, so leave your contacts with me. Excuse me, but what happened here? You won't believe it. The demolition squad bulldozed in, setting tires on fire to smoke us out like raccoons. I guess we're less than humans to those sons-of-bitches! Isn't that Dong-shik's mom on the stretcher? Hey, watch the nail! The nail! Uh, what? Come inside. I was looking for you a while ago. I was relieved when they told me you were out. Here. Your sister left this for you. I, KIM Joong-shik, forfeits all rights to CHOI Eun-soo's death benefit of $100,000. You won't have to worry about your tuition anymore. I had you registered back then. So if you reapply your admission, you can go back to school. And you can now reclaim your parents' house. Oh, you're here. They've been waiting for you. Are you CHOI Eun-mo? We want to buy this house you own. It's not for sale. My parents left this place to me. I'm not selling it. Actually this area has become a designated public welfare district. Under the new development plan, this place will be afforested into a park. So fact is, it's the State that's buying you out. I've got nothing more to say. If these people keep harassing you, you can move out anytime. I can now return your deposit when you need it. Redevelopment district residents consent to hometown destruction not because they want to, but because they have to. FIGHT AGAINST OPPRESSION! Don't shoot! You fucking gangsters! Motherfuckers! Come down! Why aren't the police here? It's been over 30 minutes. Whose side you think the police are on? They aren't coming - Give me that. - Okay. We don't speak to gangsters. Let's go! They're coming! I can see them! You, sons-of-bitches! Eun-mo! Mi-ae! Go! - But we need proof! - Go! Don't you have a conscience, you sons-of-bitches! Housing is a fundamental human right! Guarantee temporary housing projects to the residents! There're elders and women over here! Don't you goons have a heart? Where are we supposed to go? Mi-ae! We want the State to fulfill its responsibility! Hey, you sons-of-bitches! Get out of here, motherfuckers! Who was in charge of that wall? How was I to defend it when the excavator was charging at me? Shut the fuck up. We were almost killed because of you! They can try to kill us all, but I'm not backing down! You're our leader, say something! We'll throw Molotov cocktails. Anything to stop the excavators. Yeah, we'll do that. - It'll be payback. - But that's an immediate arrest! I'll take sole responsibility. We'll fend off the police until we can. If I offer to fold on condition that I'm the only one arrested, - they'll accept. - Joong-shik! That's not right. Then are you gonna do it? He said he's taking responsibility. Nice, nice! Out! In! In! I saw it, it's an IN! No, it went out! Hello? Huh? It's for you. You're here. Sir, this is Ms. CHOI Eun-mo. This is the insurance inspector from Seoul. So, you haven't been told about the beneficiary transfer. It's not like that. I just wanted to understand what really happened. What really happened? What do you mean? Why the beneficiary was changed? Was it a car accident or gas explosion that killed my sister? It's a gas explosion. Who said anything about a car accident? Is that what your brother-in-law told you? I smell something fishy here. In fact I'm here due to some loose ends with the investigation. Your sister died from a gas explosion. But the gas pipe supposedly causing the leak disappeared. Thanks. So I had suspicion of intentional evidence destruction. But since Mr. KIM wasn't aware of his wife's insurance policy, and wanted to transfer all rights to his sister-in-law, I closed the case. However, I did acquire a notarial deed. And made sure we wouldn't have to process the payment. As it was unlikely the deceased's sister would show up. Any company would take that kind of position, right? I'll give you my business card. You make me wonder if there's more to investigate. I'm still not sure if I should reopen the case or not, but I'd like us to keep in close contact. We need to talk. If you keep resisting, we'll have to drag you to the night club. But if you cooperate, we'll talk here. Your call. Is this about the night club debt or selling my house? Our boss seems to have a good impression of you. Forget the night club debt. Let's just talk about your parents' house. We'll take it off the afforestation list. So you don't have to sell it to us anymore. Just tell your brother-in-law to drop out of the Task Force. Why don't you tell him yourself? Stop it. You're making us look like gangsters. Since you now know what my boss wants, think hard what's best for you. Come on, let's go. Where have you been? People have all gone out to find you! We heard you were kidnapped by the demolition gangsters! Uh, there they are. Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere? Are you okay? I'm fine... They haven't done anything awful to you, have they? - Let's see! - Stop it! What happened? Why did those thugs kidnap you? Tell us! It's okay, tell us. It was about the debt. What? I owe the night club money. Debt? Jesus. How can you be so immature? - It's your sister's memorial... - What's it to you! What's it to you! Does she even think before she speaks? She's so thoughtless. Can you believe her? Where were you all day? Mr. KIM asked me to help out. You weren't here and Mr. KIM was busy. Tell me, how my sister died. There were no witnesses, so I don't know for sure. A hit-and-run's always like that. I heard there was a gas explosion here 7 years ago. Is it possible to look at the files related to the case? What's this about? Are you with a TV station? No, it was my house that caught on fire that day. Those files are not open to the public. OH Dae-hwan SHINHAN INSURANCE 7 YEARS AGO Are you tired? Uh huh... I'm sleepy... What's your ID number? Why do you ask? I need to register something. Do you need it now? No, we can do it in the morning. Eun-mo! Your brother-in-law's here! Go to the career advisory office! I've discussed this with your sister. And we think you should go to prep school. Then I'll consider it a 'yes' and inform your head teacher. It'll be good for you to go to college, right? You can't even afford it. Then why the hell did you marry me? It's been months! What the hell's the problem? Because I'm not a virgin? Or because of these horrible burns? So what? It's not my fault! - Why're you doing this to me? - It's okay, sis. Why did you marry me! You've got me! Forgive me. Forgive me. Did you sleep well? You've got quite a feast there. Your brother-in-law needs to sleep. Just have milk today. Milk on an empty stomach is good for constipation. When did he come home? Early in the morning. Hey! - Mommy! - Don't run, you'll fall! You played in the dirt again, didn't you? Come inside and get washed. Then we'll have supper. Aren't you going in? I can't believe class has started. And I almost made it. I need money. My sister's become a slave. I really need to reclaim my sister. And my house. But for now I have no power or strength to do so. Me neither. I ran like crazy for nothing. You married him for money, right? I'm leaving for Seoul. There I'll try to earn enough. Just wait five, no three years. Do you have a red magic marker? Magic marker? I don't think so. Not even a felt-tip pen? Why are you standing in my way? Have you got something to say? Uh, no. You're hiding something from me, right? No. I said, NO! I want you home early! Hey, Eun-mo! Mi-ae, we're leaving today. It'll just complicate things if I go back home today. Okay, then I'll wait for you there. Okay. TEA Done? - Good? - Yes. You can use a lighter to burn it off. - Wait. - Stop, it doesn't matter. I brought your order. What is it? A cup of coffee, please. SEARCHING FOR MISSING GIRLS - Hello? - This is Mi-ae's father. Oh, hi. - Mi-ae has just come home. - Really? What about Eun-mo? She said Eun-mo's afraid to come home. They parted 30 minutes ago near the pillow factory. You haven't told Mi-ae about Eun-mo's sister, right? Of course not. Where's the person now? The one who killed my sister. It was a hit-and-run. Why'd you move? Dae-yeon had some issues. Besides it was our newlywed pad... I just couldn't stay there. Let's go now. Eun-mo, do you mind staying here alone? It's freezing. Three coffees. I'd like the pretty lady pour it for us. 3 YEARS AGO Let's get out of here. Okay? Help me find a size 75A in this design. We can leave only when I've found one. Is this it? How about this one? This one's nice, it's a size 75. Can't we eat instant noodles anymore? Noodles? We'll have instant noodles as soon as we're done with this. Okay! He must be really hungry. He lives nearby and spends a lot of time here, because his parents work late. Highest grade, 75! Nany! Cameo! Chao! There's a college open call soon, right? Yes. Is there a major you have in mind? Perhaps Philosophy of Religion? - Or Social Welfare? - Really? That'll make you a good partner for me. I haven't decided yet. You look good. I'm good myself. The surgery's gone well. He's almost fully recovered. I just wanted to let you know. - Someone's calling your mobile! - Uh? Okay! - Did you buy a mobile? - Yeah, yesterday. But you always hated those things. Yeah, it's me. Are you done? You must've stayed up all night. I was about to leave. I should avoid the rush hour traffic to Seoul. Want my mobile number? Maybe later. I'll call if I'm late. These documents are testimonies from North Koreans, who escaped repatriation camps after defecting. These are the English translated version. Who did the translations? I'm not sure. If these get into the wrong hands due to negligent security, clearly they'll be misused. And the authorities will subject everyone to interrogation. We've got to be careful. Did you submit your application? Yes. I'll check the translator and have them keep the documents safe. Okay. But are these testimonies credible? - See you later. - Yeah, good bye. - See you. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Aren't people talking? About what? You're living with your sister-in-law who's a grown woman. She was just a kid when I first met her. Besides, she won't be living here for long. Since she's going away for college next year. Joong-shik's been arrested. What? A detective took him away. Let's go inside, there's something I need to hide. Where... is he now? Who? Why don't you ever call him 'brother-in-law'? What's it to you? He's held at the Paju police station. But he could be transferred to Seoul. Hello? Yes. Is attorney CHO busy these days? Hello? Hello, it's me. Everything's okay. Nothing bad will happen. I haven't paid your college tuition yet. Search my drawers for the bank book and bill. The deadline's tomorrow. Make sure you pay by then. Okay. Since I'm in prison, I need you to bring me a few things. A few items to clean up and... POST OFFICE BANK BOOK Strange that I'm here? No. It's okay. You must've been scared last night. No. I slept well. Here's what you asked for yesterday. Wait. PAJU POST OFFICE TRAVEL AGENCY I'm thinking of going on a trip. Are you planning to go overseas? India. I think India would be good. Hey, you sons-of-bitches! Get him! You motherfucker! Fucking assholes! Why do you do this? What... do you get out of this, 'brother-in-law'? I'm not sure... At first I did it because it was cool, then because I felt I owed people a lot. But now, I'm not sure. It just seems I'm always faced with more things to do. And it never ends. I don't understand you. Eun-mo! Wait a minute. Sorry. I need to take a short nap. Everyone's using my place. The water's cut off, right? Yes. I had the impression you had something to say to me. You called me 'brother-in-law' back there. Brother-in-law... Have you ever loved my sister? I couldn't... love your sister. Is it because of your first love? It has nothing to do with Ja-young. There's nothing to even consider between us. We can't go there anymore. Then... what about me? Eun-mo... There was never a moment when I haven't loved you. Three years ago when you suddenly disappeared, I couldn't believe you could do that to me. Especially when I was tied up in prison. I was swept with secular emotions, I hated you like crazy. Even when I vowed never to see you again, I really was in love with you. Waiting for you... Is that... all you can say to me? I need to know. I have to know the truth. It is the truth. All of it. Where to, miss? Just go. - Are you okay? - Excuse me? No, I was just... - Is there any left? - Of course. Anyway, I don't believe it. - When did they arrest him? - This morning. For Molotov cocktail throwing? No, I think they said insurance fraud. But he's not the kind of person to do that! This is not the time to worry about others. We all threw Molotovs because of Joong-shik. And now we might all get arrested for it. The insurance thing, he was absolved last time. - So, what's the problem? - I know. The truth doesn't matter. They'll use any excuse to throw him in. This kind of thing is perfect to use against him. It won't be long for the press to hop on the bandwagon. Why did Eun-mo have to cause trouble now? She's a serial runaway. You think she would be considerate? Her sister had died. I would've done the same thing! Just shut up! I can't do this anymore. You must be kidding! - I can't anymore... - So, you're bailing out? But you don't have a child. Go! No one's holding you back! You're not the only one suffering! - We're all suffering! - Stop it! Can I see Mi-ae? Don't ever come back. Want me to set the record straight? The truth has to come out. It'll be okay. There're just accusations but no proof. And the Task Force? What about the Task Force? I've been so arrogant. Once again I've forgotten how foolish a man I am. Dae-yeon. I know this from experience. It's better for Eun-mo not to know what really happened that day. The bible says, one lost lamb is more important than a flock of 99. Hey, CHOI Eun-mo! Thanks! We'll also keep our promise! Thanks!
