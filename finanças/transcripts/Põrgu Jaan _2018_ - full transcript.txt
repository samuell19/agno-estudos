He's alive! If you call that living... THE RIDDLE OF JAAN NIEMAND What do you want from here? Who are you? A fancy man like you shouldn't lie around on beaches... You're lucky to make it back alive. Do you understand what I'm saying? Sure you do. Come on, then! Spetburgunder! To your health! Pardon me... but we don't see suits like that around here... before the war, maybe. Tell me, how are things where you come from? How many fled? How many fell? How many got sick? I don't... remember. You remember your name, don't you? Here. This is the place. This is where we found him. Or maybe it wasn't here? It was farther away... The fish haven't come to the river to spawn... The black bird has no nest. The calendar says the seed needs to be sown by now... it must be done. Ah. I was looking for you. Put that down. Jaan Niemand, does that name mean anything to you? What's that? Open it. So... What is it? It's a doctor's traveling case that seems to have belonged to a doctor named Jaan Niemand. Tiidrik found it next to where they found you. I think it belongs to you. So you figured out where you found me? A few feet here or there, what difference does it make? Come! Read, please. Sartorius, gracilis, gluteus maximus, rectus femoris, vastus medialis, vastus lateralis... Do you know what that means? These are names of muscles... Not everybody does! You'll be more comfortable here. Yes? Master sent for you... Close the door. Sit, please. How do you feel? Better? I guess so. And your memory? Three villages... 15 farms... more than 80 people... an orchard... a distillery, a watermill... great, big fields. Parties... lavish parties... suits finer than you could even imagine. If I told you that by the time Albert inherits this place from me... it all will be restored... you would think I'm crazy? What happened to him? I don't know. Nobody does. No doctor has examined him. The last one died before he had the chance. How long has Albert been like this? Bad things have happened here... They came on horses... Master wasn't home... only the Baroness, the boy and the maid. Later, we found the Baroness under the window... dead. She jumped. The boy stopped talking... and soon got sick. The maid saw something, I think... but spoke gibberish. Made no sense. She ran away. Soon after. Doctor, sir! Doctor, sir! I heard Master Jaan is a doctor. My daughter is dying... would you have a look? She's dead. That's her. The maid. Shit! Now where has the Doctor been so late at night? It's not enough that they won't work or do as they're told. Now they come to mock us! I saw him. Where, damnit?! Where is he? Who? The shitter. Went back to where he came from. Let me help you. The hell you can. You're no doctor. You can't even remember your own name. Why did you do that? Master only wants what's best for you. No man is higher than the rest! All sinners burn in hell... - Shut up! Whatever their provenance... - Shut up! Everyone's the same! We don't need your fancy tricks here. The German varietal is supposed to be lighter than the French Pinot Noir. Well? Maybe you Sirs can continue your meal later... They've completely lost it. All hell has broken loose. What are they doing? Renouncing. - Repenting. Why are they burning their things? - Like it's been said... He who wants to enter heaven must renounce his worldly things. Madness. This is madness. I can understand that rashes come from dirtiness... a cough comes from being poorly dressed. But this? This is madness... Please let me examine you. There's nothing to see here, you can examine each other at the manor. Leave us out of it. Abscesses, chronic itching, stomach aches, high fever, horrible dreams, hallucinations... It's an old disease. Every book calls it by a different name. St. Anthony's fire. Ergot fungus. All of the grain must be infected. The cure? All the books agree on this... we cannot eat any more of this grain. Get up! Where's the grain? Damn it! Get out! Take it out! Stand here. Where do you think you're going? So...? Damn... Arsehole! Take this. Share it equally. You've done good work. Albert seems better. We are fortunate you ended up on our doorstep. What if we made a mistake? You said so yourself... the itching comes from dirtiness... the coughing from being poorly clothed. Alright. I did. And the visions? Yes. Hold on now! Where are you going? I just want to listen. You will do as Master says! Master won't find out. If they catch you, you'll get a beating. I just want to listen! He stands in front of me and asks me to follow... and I fall into the deep, into the dark. Where the air is like sulphur that makes your eyes hurt. And there are others with tears pouring, burning their faces. There is a man with a pig growing out of his side... and a woman with a tongue so long it gets stuck under her feet. I see myself... and others. Everyone. All the villagers. You. Foreign peoples... old kings and emperors... those who are long gone and those who are still to come. They are all the same. And then, the great water comes... greater than many seas... and washes us all away. Don't tell Master. Got it? Who is she? I don't know who the Doctor means... The girl... She was dead. Yes, she was. She went to hell. But she came back. The villagers think you have to burn all your stuff so God will forgive you. But there is no more forgiveness. They don't listen to all of what Eia says... A great flood is coming! And then they will see. Then they can all get on my boat. Don't tell Master! Sir looks like he's seen a ghost. It's not good to go wandering alone. The horsemen... You saw them? You're not the only one. Who are they? They are circling... you can see them from afar. In the dark. They are waiting... for some time already. People say all kinds of things... so it's not good to wander alone. What do they say? Some say the horsemen bring the end of the world. Some say they bring blessings. But some say they're the same murderers who were here already. They say that thieves never go too far... if there is still something left to take. Does Master know? Yes and no. He doesn't want to know. It's cold in here, Jaan. Tell the boy to bring some wood. You never caught them? No. We didn't. But one of them is walking around with a hideous scar... if he's alive at all. The Baroness took care of that. When we found her, she had a letter opener in her hand... clutched tight... all bloody. Her dress as well. The footprints in the yard split up. One group of four fled to the north... a single rider to the south with a trail of blood behind him. He must have been badly wounded. We took a risk... and tried to catch the larger group. We rode for long but... saw nothing. Later we turned south, but... Enough of the past, Jaan. This machine... unfortunately, it only goes in one direction... forward. What did you see? Where's Tiidrik? On the sea. What do you mean "on the sea"? With what? There's a storm. Answer me! Tiidrik was building a boat. What boat? The girl speaks of a flood. I tried to stop him but Master knows that you can't stop Tiidrik. He went to the village, asked people to join him... they just laughed at him. Maybe he'll come back! The girl! Where is she? If she doesn't shut up, I'll lock her up. What! Stop putting ideas in people's heads! Come here! Have you seen me before? Where? Here at the manor? Deep down... in the dark. What was I there for? For your sins. What sins? A sin is a sin. They're coming, Jaan. I'm not Jaan. Who are you then? The fifth horseman. A murderer. The letter opener... You never stop, do you? What do you want? Get out! Go... be... be whoever you want! Where is she? Where? The barn, where else? Liar! Are you going to stay there?
