[Cell phone ringing] Hello? HANI: We could just elope, you know. But then you wouldn't get to see me dressed like an extra from Dynasty. So much to do. Your hair looks perfect, Madam. When I want your opinion, I'll give it to you. Madam? That one. Thank you, Madam. [Sighs] I need a cigarette. - HANl: Are you ready? - Almost. I'm working. HANI: 2O minutes before our engagement party starts? Where is my husband? In the garden, Madam. And where is my coffee? Coming, Madam. Did the dress fit Tala? She didn't stop eating at lunch. Like a glove, Madam. HANI: I love you. Bye, Tala. Bye. And Lama? Did you take in her clothes? By two centimeters, Madam. Excellent. KAREEM: Ah! Let's hope this is the final engagement party your father has to throw for your sister. For a man of his stature to endure the shame... [Speaks in Arabic] How do I look? You could cover your shoulders a little more. It's not cold. It's not proper. Did Zina like the green dress I picked for her? Oh, she loved it, Madam. [Exhales deeply] The cake? How does the cake look? [Speaking in Arabic] It looks perfect, Madam. Just perfect. [Spanish version of "Alabina" by Alabina plays] WOMAN 1 : She'll do it before dinner. WOMAN 2: No way. Tala loves her food too much. The last time, she broke the engagement before dinner. WOMAN 2: And the first time, she waited till Reema had her mouth full of coffee. I just hope she keeps the jewelry this time. Eight carats, D flawless, who wouldn't? WOMAN 2: Tala never keeps the jewelry. She's always had a screw loose. - And how is my favorite niece, huh? - Ammo Ramzi. [ Laughs] Hi. You managed to get on a plane? Plane? Ha! You know I'll never get on a plane. Not after that dream I had. [Speaking in Arabic] The crash! The devastation! The dream was in 1967. Right after the Six-Day War! Israel has a lot to answer for. Anyway, I wouldn't have missed it. I wanted to meet the man who made it this far. . . again. Ammo, I love him. Of course you love him. He's Christian, and he's rich. Not to mention kind, thoughtful, and forward-thinking. And handsome. UNCLE RAMZI: Handsome is good. But ask your aunty why she married me, huh. Looks and character come and go. Only large sums of money last forever. So it would seem. You look amazing, Habibti. I wish I could say the same. That's because I've been alone with Mama and Lamia for four whole days. You know, I think I found those weapons of mass destruction Bush was looking for. How clever of him to disguise them as two Arab housewives. [ Laughs] Zina, that dress looks beautiful on you. Mama says you should be entertaining your guests. Yeah, Tala, surely you should be familiar with engagement-party etiquette by now. [ Laughs] She looks so happy, doesn't she, Reema? Of course. OMAR: And beautiful. Just like her mother. SAM: No, no, no. No, I don't think so. I understand what you're saying. But I think that 10% is the maximum you can expect from that spread. No. Bye. I thought you'd gone for the day. The printer's not working at home. What are you printing? Oh, just some. . . bits and pieces. Come on, come up. Sit down. You have a minute, don't you? All this is going to be yours one day, you know. All of it'? SAM: And your sister's. But sales are everything. They're the lifeblood of this place. [Sighs] You know I'm not good at selling, Dad. You don't sell life insurance. I know, I know. It sells itself. Life insurance is a sure bet. I just asked my client, "Do you know you are going to die?" There is only one answer. Then I ask him, "Are you 150% absolutely, positively happy that your wife and your kids are properly taken care of?" You've got 'em! Come on, try it. Uh, Dad. Oh, come on. I'm your client. Try it. [Sighs] I'm sorry. Dad. I'm good at the admin. Yasmin's better with people. She's a waitress! She's learning so she can start her own food company. Three years at university so she can wash dishes! She doesn't need her own company. She has her own company. I have a date with Ali tonight. I like him. He's a good boy. Are you going to the mosque first? We're heading into town to see a friend of his, then we're having dinner. It's Friday! I believe in our religion, I do. I just... I don't like to go when everyone else does. If you don't go when everyone else does, how will they know you're a good Muslim? Go on, then. But don't be out too late. I'm not 6, Dad. I know. ["Number One Boy" by Nadine Khouri plays] LEYLA: So she's Palestinian, your friend? ALI: Yeah, she lives in London, but her wedding will be back in Jordan, where I was for her engagement party, you remember? What does Tala do? I think she has something of her grandfather's spirit in her. You know she's recently launched a company over here? [Rings doorbell] For an Arab woman from her background, that's pretty unusual. What's the matter? You nervous? A bit. I'm always like that with new people. Don't be. Tala's great. Trust me, you'll love her. HOUSEKEEPER: Evening. - ALI: Evening. How long have you and Ali been dating? About two months. And? Does he want to marry you? Uh... LEYLA: I think he's just waiting for me to ask him. Tala, my eldest daughter, is getting married in six weeks. And what does your father do? Stop interrogating the poor girl, Mama. ALI: Hey. TALA: She is going outwith Ali, not me. Tala, meet Leyla. Hello. Sorry to break your British reserve, but we always kiss in Jordan, usuallyjust before we slit your throat. When are you going to stop criticizing your homeland? When everyone else stops being afraid to. LEYLA: How do you and Ali know each other? He went to school with my third fiancé. They were at Cornell together. She's had four, you know. Fiancée, I mean. Four? REEMA: She's too picky. I always liked Namir. Mama, he was a drug addict. He was from a very respectable family. Yeah, and during our engagement party, I caught him in the bathroom with white powder on his nose. You always jump to conclusions! Maybe he was trying to hide a skin blemish. He had some pock marks on one side of his face. Tala! I've just had your wedding dress taken in. Congratulations on your wedding. Will it be in a mosque? A Church! A church! TALA: Not all Arabs are Muslims. Oh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have assumed. Are you a Muslim? Yes. TALA: Why? REEMA: Tala, what kind of question is that? Because she was born a Muslim. No, she wasn't. Weren't you? She was born a female. And a member of a certain race. And if she'd been adopted by a Jewish family, she'd have been Jewish. Thank God she wasn't adopted! What the Middle East doesn't need is more Jews. Mama, please don't start with the anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitic? Who's anti-Semitic? I am Semitic! That's the point. And yet the Israelis grabbed Palestine from us. And Arab countries threw out over a million Arab Jews. But the Israelis should be fair to the Palestinians. They know what it's like to lose their land. Now someone's speaking sense! TALA: True. But we need to draw a line under the past and move forward. Your headache medicine, Madam. I don't have a headache. But it's 7:00, Madam. Well, then, I haven't adjusted to London time yet. Nice to have met you. I apologize for my daughter. Good night. See you. TALA: You didn't answer my question. I'm not Jewish. Why not? Why aren't you? I don't subscribe to any religion. - So you live without any faith? - Ah, I didn't say that. Why should my beliefs offend you? They don't. I just wanna know why they don't offend you. Tala, ease up! Don't they do small talk in the Middle East? This is small talk in the Middle East. For serious debate, we move on to politics. And before that happens, I'm gonna take Leyla to dinner. Do you want to blow off your parents and join us? They are going back to Jordan tomorrow. But thank you both. Perhaps another time. I'd like that. We can be all British and talk about the weather. You are naughty! MAYA: Leyla! He'll be here soon! Come on! I don't understand why Ali can't eat with us first. He's booked a tennis court, Mum. At 1 :00? That's lunchtime. Uh, only in the suburban time zone, Mum. I believe London's, what, two hours ahead of us? Or would that be two years? You and your cosmopolitan attitude! What kind of salad are you making, anyway? It's a Greek salad. Oh! And an Indian salad isn't good enough for you? Mum, what is an Indian salad? Week-old lettuce and chilies? You two are so worried about other cultures. London! Greece! What about your own heritage? Did you ever think about that? India has one of the richest cultures in the world! Well, I'm glad you said that, Mum. Because I'm thinking of spending six months out there, backpacking. You are not going backpacking. And in India of all places! What about the culture? The heritage? What about being raped and murdered? And clean underwear? Were you going to take underwear, Yasmin? Ah! MAYA: What if you meet people we know? They'll think we can't afford to send you on a real holiday! Mum, there are, like, a billion people in India. What are the chances that I'm going to bump into someone from your Surrey bridge club? [Doorbell rings] Ali! Are you going to the door dressed like that? We're going to play tennis, Mum. - What's that smell? - YASMIN: It's feta cheese. - Hi. - Hi. How are you? ALI: Hey! - MAYA: Ali! - Hi, Auntie. Hello. - How are you? - First class! - ALI: Hi, Uncle. - SAM: Hello, Ali. ALI: Mmm, something smells good in here. Thank you. That's my Greek salad. Hey, Yasmin, I didn't know you could cook. Of course she can. And so can Leyla. She makes the best cakes. And never puts on weight. - LEYLA: Mmm-hmm. - Yep, that's our Leyla. She's gonna make a wonderful housewife someday. And apparently she knows how to sell life insurance with the best of them. How many times do I have to tell you? It sells itself! LEYLA: We should be going. - Bye, Uncle. - MAYA: Oh, next time come for lunch. Oh, I'd love to, next time. - LEYLA: Come. - ALI: Okay, okay. Let's hope she has the sense to hold onto him. Like a life raft. Mum! [Sighs] Oh, by the way, umm, we're meeting some friends at the club. I hope that's okay. Scared I'll beat you one-on-one? Ooh, terrified. Who are we playing with? You remember Tala'? Oh, and another friend of mine, Jeff. Actually, I owe Jeff a game, so you can play Tala. Is that okay? Fine. Hey! How are you guys doing? I hope you've been practicing. - Hey. How are you? - JEFF: Not bad, you? - ALI: Good. - LEYLA: Hello. ["Hey, Girl" featuring Vivienne Poona plays] Come, let's play. - How are you? - Hey. They have a really great coach here if you want a lesson. That was amazing. You're pretty good, you know. You're not so bad yourself. This way. I'll show you the changing rooms. That was quite a comeback. I prayed for divine intervention. Look, I didn't say that there wasn't a God. It's just religion that bothers me. Sorry if I offended you. On the contrary, you made me think. Yeah? About what? About -- thank you -- why we follow certain paths. Is it just expectation or conditioning? Oww! Let me take a look at that. It's all right. I'm always clumsy. You know, you should really relax more. Just. . . be at ease with yourself. Maybe a shower will help. They're over there. All right. [Laughing] So, are you coming for the polo match tomorrow? Honey, as much I'd like to see you fall on your ass, HO can do tOfTIOITOW. Rugby's on. It's just a practice game, but it's usually fun. I'm supposed to have lunch with my family tomorrow. Hey, I'm sure they won't mind. Think of all the fun you'll have treading divots. Just watch where you tread, huh. You missed lunch yesterday, and now you want to miss it today. It's Sunday! Why don't you ask Ali to come for lunch? He could meet Namima. He's taking me to a polo match, Mum. Polo? You mean the game? No, Mum, she means the mints. All those horses and sweating South Americans! Will Prince Charles be there? Well, at least you're making an effort for a change. MAYA: What's that? [Cell phone rings] - Excuse me. - Sure. - Hello? - SAM: Leyla? Hi, Dad. Listen, we're going to be later than I thought. Ali's really into the polo. - SAM: He just called. - Who just called? SAM: Ali. He asked if you wanted to go over to his place to watch the rugby after you got back. I didn't tell your mother. Thanks, Dad. TALA: Thanks, Antoinette. See you later. TALA: Hello! Hello! Impressed? LEYLA: Mmm... I didn't even break out in a sweat. I kept thinking you were gonna fall, leaning across on the horse like that. I like to take chances. Is that why you left your family's business? I wanted to see if I could create my own brands. I'm impressed. No, don't be. Not yet, at least. I've yet to get a decent order. But something should pan out soon. How about you? - Me? - Mmm. Nothing to tell. My dad encouraged me to join his company, and I've never left. And? Do you like it there? It's not exactly inspiring. So what inspires you, Leyla? Writing. Fiction. Can I read some of your stuff? Uh... How else am I going to find out what goes on beneath that quiet exterior? [ "Little Feeling" by Leonie Casanova plays] $0... Let's... Hello? Really? You have an amazing talent. I'm just learning. Make sure you do something with it. Have you really been engaged four times? [Sighs] I mean, you seem like such a decisive person. Yeah, well, I'm not proud of it. You know about the last guy. He had a problem with drugs. Or make up. The second guy, well, he ticked all the boxes. He was Christian-Arab, good family, handsome, intelligent. It just didn't click. I can understand that. And the first? Well, that was a big mistake I let my mother pressurize me into. He produces tons of dates. My mother loves dates. You can never have too many dates. Oh, trust me, I found out you can. How about you? What about you and Ali? How's that going? I like him a lot. Does it click? Not the way I imagine it should. Well, maybe we expect too much. It's starting to rain. Oxford ! Oxford's where you go to get a degree, not to get away. It's only an hour by train. Why do you have to go for two days? So, if it takes me three hours I can stay the night? Oh, my God! What is that? It's Ethiopian bread. We have Indian bread right here. Anyway, I thought they were starving in Ethiopia. Yeah, well, if they had bread, then this is what it would look like. Who are you going with? A friend. Ooh, Ali. No, not Ali. Does everything have to revolve around him? Hey, she has a friend, and they're going away for a couple of days. Why do you make everything a problem? ["Mirror, Mirror" featuring Nadine Khouri plays] Don't let her get to you, Ley. She's not. . . . She's not getting to me. What's wrong? Are you two-timing Ali? Of course not. You know me. I can barely go outwith one guy properly. Yeah, why is that? Is there anything you want to talk to me about? No. I mean anything. You lied to Mum and Dad last week about the polo with Ali. I know. I can't believe I did that. No, it's about time if you ask me. But why? Who are you going to Oxford with? Nobody. Just Tala. I see. What? What do you see? Well, nothing. It's just you've been spending a lot of time with this Tala, haven't you? She's nice. Nice? Nice, as in Mum's bridge-club ladies nice, or nice as in. . . hot? What's wrong with you? Her family's sponsoring a charity event. And her sister's going to be there, okay? 0kay! MAYA: Do you two think that lunch will make itself? No, but that lettuce is ready to walk out the fridge on its own. MAYA: Come and take this horrible bread and send it to Africa where it belongs! TALA: Have you been to Oxford before? LEYLA: Oh, I love it. There's something magical about it, especially the buildings. That sweet city with her dreaming spires. Matthew Arnold? TALA: Mmm-hmm. Shall we go see the library? LEYLA: I'd love to. What's Lamia doing? TALA: Buying a picnic hamper. LEYLA: Is she upset with us? TALA: Just with me. She wants me to shop for the wedding. LEYLA: In Oxford? TALA: Well, I refused to meet her in Paris. TALA: Here, Leyla, try it. LEYLA: Mmm, that is amazing. Lamia, would you like to try some? I don't do carbs. TALA: Since when? Lamia, you study here, right? Mmm-hmm. LEYLA: What subject? Flower arranging. So, I hear you didn't get the order. Well, maybe now you can come back and help Baba and stop all this independent stuff. You know, Leyla's the most brilliant writer. You have to read her stuff. No, no, I'm just learning. But I do love it. One day soon, you will read her stuff in bookstores. Could you publish an edition with pictures in it? TALA: Shall we walk some more? - LAMIA: No. - LEYLA: Yes. LEYLA: Whatever you prefer. I need to get back to the room. Kareem always checks where I am. Tell him that you're busy. Are you coming with me? No. Come on. It's exactly that kind of relationship I've wanted to avoid at all costs. So your fiancée not like that'? Hani? No. He is an Arab, and was born and brought up in Jordan, but he's different from the rest. Kind, open-minded. And he makes a great martini. He sounds wonderful. Yeah, he is. He is. At least, I can't find anything wrong with him. Why are you trying? Thank you. For what? For all this. It's overwhelming. You know, it's been a while since I've seen it all through new eyes. Thank you. ["Ma Fini Fakker" featuring Mena plays] I have absolutely no sense of rhythm. Come here. Have you ever done this before? Slept with a woman while my fiancé makes wedding preparations? No. Never done that before. That's not what I meant. When I was 18, I fell madly in love with a girl my first year in college. We spent a few wonderful months together. I never knew I could feel so complete, so alive. Till now, obviously. Till now. So, what happened? I broke it off. I was in pieces. I told myself that it was for the best, that I was away from home, and I was lonely, and... And. . . now? This is not a way to live, Leyla. It's not easy. It's not acceptable. We didn't break any rules last night, Tala. Yeah, but we did where I come from, okay? Nobody lives like this, at least not openly. And you live in the West now. Yeah, but I don't think it's acceptable to cheat on your fiancé anywhere in the world. ["Tell Me" featuring Leonie Casanova plays] What do you like most about this place? Worlds that once existed. Just. . . the scent of antiquity. Eww! It smells like mold in here. I don't care what anyone says, Lamia. You have a romantic soul. Hello, Mama, can you hear me? Stop the dryer. Hello, Lamia. LAMIA: Mama. Your tea, Madam. LAMIA: This place is a complete dump! Give it to Philippe. LAMIA: All museums and no shops. They don't even have a Gucci! REEMA: Did you get her something colorful? Tala thinks grey is a color. And they got bored of shopping. They? LAMIA: Her friend is here with her. Leyla. The Indian Jewess? The Indian. I didn't know she was Jewish. They're spending all their time together. LAMIA: I guess it's nice for Tala to have such a close friend. Good thing she's coming back next week. That's the other thing. I think she wants to stay in London a while longer. REEMA: She did this with the second engagement. Or was it the first? And she never came back for the wedding. I'm sure it's not exactly like that. LAMIA: Mama? Mama? Home sweet home. [Telephone rings] Hello? Mama! - HANl: Hello, Albee, my love. - TALA: Hani! Did you enjoy your trip? Yes. HANI: I'd give anything to be with you now. Sit down, sit down. I have a surprise for Tala. I'd like you to see it. HANI: How was your trip? TALA: Fine, I just walked in. HANI: I know. TALA: How do you know? HANI: I can see you. What do you mean? Where are you? Right here! Habibti! REEMA: They're so in love. It brings tears to my eyes. And you must be Leyla. It's such a pleasure to meet you. Tala's talked about you a lot. LEYLA: You too. How was Oxford? Lovely. Much more than I had expected. HANI: You know, no one ever says how romantic Oxford is -- the river, the buildings, the history. Well, let's have dinner. You girls must be hungry. I have to go, but thank you. Oh, no, I won't hear of it! A quick bite! Hani works in the Jordanian government, you know. TALA: The foreign office. Does that cover relations with Israel? Yes. How can you stand it? We have to stand it. And sometimes even learn something from the Israelis. What do you want to learn? How to shoot children? Obviously not that. But Israel is the closest thing to a democracy that we have in the Middle East. Oh, thank God I didn't send your sisters to that American school! They turned you into an Arab-hater. Aunty, your daughter is one of the proudest Palestinians I know. Why don't you show Leyla and Tala the invitations? - What invitations? - Our wedding! REEMA: Well? It's beautiful. HANI: Hmm. Really perfect. Are you all right? Just a headache. REEMA: Here. I just need the bathroom. REEMA: Upstairs. Ninth door on the left. Thank you. Do you want me to go with you? No, I'm fine. What are you doing? Holding your hand. So what happens? We each get five minutes of hand-holding? I get a night in Oxford and he gets a night in London? That's not fair. What is fair, Tala? We can't live like this. Our families wouldn't understand. I can't lead you into a life that's. . . difficult. I don't need your protection. Thanks to you, I know what I want, and I can't go back. I want to feel the way I did last night every day. I want to be with someone that ten years from now makes my heartjump when I hear her key in the door. And that someone is you. I. . . . I can't hurt Hani. Are you in love with him? There are things I love about him. I can't ruin lives. You will. Especially yours. HANI: Tala? Are you okay? Tell me you can do this. LEYLA: Good-bye, Tala. Hmm, Ramzi! Welcome! Hello! Welcome! Christ, I'm still here. [Cries] No two women should look this beautiful at 6:00 in the morning. Is the king coming for breakfast? No, I'm going to the airport. Sami's flying in from New York for the wedding. I haven't seen your brother in years. Does he still like musicals? I don't know. But I'm sure he's looking very much forward to seeing you. Why? We'll be back in time for breakfast with your parents. Wasn't he supposed to get a place for Lamia, like, four years ago? Would you leave a suite at the best hotel in town if you were getting it for free? I'd leave Paradise itself if Mama was there. Well, Kareem would brave hell to secure his inheritance. He's not their son. But, in the absence of a son, he is the perfect son-in-law. Which David could never be. Anyway, he broke up with me. He did? I'm sorry, Habibti. He wants to bring up his kids as Jews. Hannukah. Passover. Imagine Mama's face. Mmm, I'd really rather not, though it might be worth it. We thought we could start our own mini peace process. He never made a secret of being attached to his culture. Then, why did he even get involved with you? I mean, what kind of a person allows you to get emotionally entangled when they know that there's no way forward? I need a coffee. No. No. You need to stop selling yourself short Sometimes... Sometimes you can't stop and rationalize everything so perfectly. Don't you ever just do something, even when you know deep down it's going to be a disaster? KAREEM: You will like Zina, if you give her a chance. She's a nice girl. And she wears a lot of black also. I think the two of you will match perfectly, huh? I'm really not interested in women. KAREEM: Too busy working at the investment bank, I imagine. You have to start thinking about your future, Sami. What, like you? Hmm, yes. Like me. Welcome, Sami. Thank you. It's not very often that I have all my daughters at home at the same time. I'd like to propose a toast. To Tala and Hani. EVERYONE: To Tala and Hani. And may you have many daughters. LAMIA: Oh, Baba! Eww. No, thanks. I'm a vegetarian. Really? Me too! Have you ever been to Dan's Bakery in New York? In the village! I love that place! SAMI: They make the best... TOGETHER: Arabic Bread! And they have the best-looking bakers. That's not important. Well, it is to me. [Laughing] Did anyone see? There was another suicide bomb last night. It's barbaric, the way they brainwash these people. This idea of a paradise waiting for you if you kill innocent people. They're not killing innocent people. They're killing Israelis. Have you forgotten what they did to us at Sabra and Shatila and DeirYassin? So we sink to their level and kill children? Children who will grow up to be Israeli soldiers. Kareem, please. With all due respect, Hani, but you and I have never suffered like our Palestinian countrymen. If I remember rightly, you were busy the last time we went to a refugee camp to interview people for jobs. I was holding the fort at the office for your father that day. And Lamia and I went to the Refugee Charity Dinner just last month. Hmm, where the refugees washed the dishes. [Laughing] Will you all excuse me, please? I've, um. . . . I've got a lot I have to do. REEMA: The seamstress will be here at 10:00. Make sure you hold your stomach in this time. ["Underground" by Nadine Khouri plays] [gasps] Are you trying to kill me? Creeping into the house like a robber? Sorry. You missed Bollywood Sisters. Nina's just found out her 16-year-old daughter is pregnant. And a drug addict. I made you some pasta. I need to talk to you. What's the matter? Are you sick? No, I'm fine. Actually, very good. HaPPV- - Where's Dad? - In town with a client. He'll be back home soon. Ali called. Oh, shit. I forgot about him. Well, he's a wonderful boy. Mum... I'm not happy with him. Then Aunty Gulshan's son is looking for someone. He's very successful. He's a bookie. Well, and tall and handsome. He's 6'7". All I can see is his navel. Well, then you'll have tall children. Mum, I can't be happy with him. The way I'm not happy with Ali. And... And I've always known why, but I was hoping that the reason I thought was the reason might not really be the reason, and that things would change, but they never have, not really. And now I know for sure that what I've been feeling all these years is actually the right thing. - Do you want cheese with this? - And there's nothing wrong with it. I haven't got cheddar like you asked, I got parmesan, though. If you could just listen to me. I'm gay! SAM: I'm home! What did I miss? I'm gay. But I've only been gone two hours! You always said you just wanted us to be happy. I lied. Who did this to you? I haven't caught a disease, Mum. I'm just gay, like I have brown hair. First you stop coming to mosque, now you're up to your neck in sin! It's not a sin! Mum, I haven't killed or stolen, and I'm trying not to lie to you. It's a huge sin! According to who? According to God! What kind of a God is that? I don't accept it! Then you will burn in hell! That's enough! It's okay. No! [ Maya cries] [Door slams shut] I think maybe it's time we discussed getting you that flat you've been asking for. If I could help it, I would. But I can't. I know, Beta. I know. How many pre-wedding dinners is it possible to have? And another thing. If the rule's no black, then fine. But how come you get a dress that's elegant, and I get one that's Liberace? Because I did Tala's shopping for her in Paris. "Zina, don't wear black. It's not a funeral. Mama." It's a funeral for the 2O lambs that got slaughtered for this dinner. They made tofu kebabs for you, Habibti. Come on, Zina. Sami's downstairs. He asked where you were. Send him this dress. He'd probably love it. What kind of a stupid comment is that? He likes you a lot, you know. ZINA: Yeah, well, I like him, too. LAMIA: You should go outwith him. He's the right age to marry. You seem to have a lot in common. You both like New York. You both like black clothes. We both like men. Stop saying things like that! [Sighs] Yeah, if you don't say it, Z, maybe it won't be true. Kareem thinks it's a phase. If he meets the right girl, he'll get over it. That strategy sure didn't work for Uncle Ramzi. Uncle Ramzi is not gay! Yeah, and the Pope ain't Catholic. What do you think, Lamia? Do you think that. . .7 Do you think that being gay is a "phase"? Do you think it's all right to sacrifice your own sister to a life of misery married to someone who's gay? No matter how well their clothes match. Well, I guess you would know more about that than anyone else. What's her problem? I have a strange sense of déjé vu. I'm sorry, Baba. Have you told Hani? I don't know what to tell him. Except that I know it won't be fair to him to go through with the wedding. Mmm-hmm. You know what fathers want for their daughters? For them to be happy. Sons move on. They have choices, especially here in the Middle East. But a daughter... A daughter needs a hand now and then. What are you going to do about this? Oh, I don't know. Maybe we can just have the party. Your Uncle Ramzi can tell his plane-crash stories, and everyone in town can toast the new scandal with champagne. See Hani. Go and get dressed. It will be okay. - Ravi! - Sir? Pack all the wedding food and send it to the camps. [Sighs] They should have cancellation insurance for weddings. That stuff would sell itself. ["Kidda" by Natasha Atlas plays] Can I have the keys, Dad? She won't get it. Get what? Nothing. Where are you going? I'm helping Leyla look for flats. She doesn't have to go. She needs to. - ALI: What exactly happened'? - TALA: I broke Hani's heart. ALI: Hey, Tala. You have to give yourself a break. If you knew he wasn't the right one, then you did exactly the right thing. Yeah, except I should have told him sooner. Look, honey, we all wish we had hindsight. So, what about you, hmm? What's new? Me? Y.F.S. Young, free and single! You're not seeing Leyla? Nah. She dumped me. What happened? Well, on the plus side, it wasn't really my fault. She told me she's gay. I know. I was shocked, too. You know, she even told her parents. You're kidding. No. Got to admire her guts. She's always had a fierce streak, that one. You know, there's not many people in our community that'd be willing to do that. Always liked that about her. Come on, you. ["Hey, My Baby" by Nadine Khouri plays] [Phone rings] Hello? Hi, this is Tala speaking. Can I speak to Leyla? Yeah. One minute. For you. Who is it? Tala. I'm not talking to her. Yasmin! Yasmin, I'm not talking to her. Take the phone! She, uh, can't come to the phone right now. No, I, uh. . . . I'll call back tomorrow. Perhaps one of the most stunning archeological finds of that century, indeed, any century, was the founding in the south of Jordan of the "lost city" of Petra. Dramatically carved out of rose-colored stone by the Nabataeans, the massive columns of the temples rise up to surprise visitors as they walk through a high canyon to reach the entrance. A breathtaking site. Now a thriving tourist destination, Petra has enthralled generations of archeologists and visitors alike thanks to the stories and beauty of its "lost city." Like the rest of Jordan, it is well worth a visit. Hello. I enjoyed the lecture you gave. I learned so much. JENNIFER: Oh, it'd be so great to go. LEYLA: Apparently you can only go to Petra on a horse or a camel. JENNIFER: That would be great. - LEYLA: It would be fun. What are you doing here? My family sponsored the lecture. What are you doing here? I'm interested in Jordan. It has a population of five million and no natural resources to speak about. Petra's lovely, but there isn't much to say about Jordan, because it's me you're interested in. How was your wedding? JENNIFER: Leyla, let's go. This is my friend, Jennifer. Your friend? Her girlfriend. Girlfriend. JENNIFER: Who was that? LEYLA: Oh, that's my. . . . My friend Tala. ["Underground" by Nadine Khouri plays] Do you want that? Do you want to join us for a drink tonight'? I can't. I have to work. Yeah, how's that going? I got the order. That's fantastic, Tala! Great! Do you know how difficult it is to get into those big chains? I thought that's exactly what you wanted. Yeah. It was. Well, we should celebrate! It'll be fun! Leyla said she might join us tonight. No. I'm really busy. Is everything okay? I don't get it. YASMIN: Which part? ALI: Why do you want to get Leyla and Tala together? I mean, the other day, Tala didn't seem interested at all. Listen. Did you ever watch the TV show, The L Word'? ALI: No. But did you ever consider not talking in riddles? They're in love with each other. Who? YASMIN: Sonny and Cher. Leyla and Tala. Leyla and Tala? - Good evening, Madam. - Good evening. I'm meeting Ali. The other party hasn't arrived yet. Would you like to take a seat at the bar or would you like me to show you to your table? - The table. - Sure. - Good evening. Reservation for Ali, 7:30. Oh, yes. Follow me. There you go, Madam. Thank you. The gentleman sends his regrets, ladies. He's unable to make it. But he does wish you a pleasant evening at his invitation. Thank you. We've been set up. So it seems. You look wonderful. So do you. I know. I'm just joking. [ Laughs] How's your husband? I don't have one. I broke off the wedding the morning of the wedding. That must have been very difficult. It was the second-hardest thing I've ever had to do. What was the first? Leaving you to go back to Jordan. Well, I'm glad to see you were discreet. Well? How did it go? Their eyes met. A brief smile played across Tala's mouth. Unconsciously, Leyla licked her lips. It's all over. Okay. I'm still getting used to the idea. You sound just like my dad when you say things like that. You know what? I've always liked your dad. What about you? How are you? Fine. Really good. My book got published! Really? I mean, it will. Next week, actually. That is so wonderful, Leyla. No one deserves it more than you. How's your girlfriend? Jennifer? Has there been more than one? No. She's fine. Thanks for asking. Do you love her? There are things I love about her. And is that good enough for you? No, not really. Did you tell your parents why you broke off your wedding? TALA: I told them it wouldn't be fair to Hani. Did you tell them why? Look, Leyla, you. . . . You don't understand. Jordan. . . . It's an unforgiving place. My parents have a strong place in that society, and it's a culture that doesn't change. I guess as long as people don't dare to be truthful about who they are, it never will change. Leyla, I love you. It's that simple. Why should it be anyone else's business, even my family's? We make it their business every time we have to lie about who we're with, and why we're with them. 'Cause, you know, you once told me to be more at ease with myself. Thanks to you, I am. Now I'm telling you the same thing. [Doorbell rings] TALA: Every night I empty my heart, but by morning it's full again. Slow droplets of you seep in through the night's soft caress. At dawn I overflow with thoughts of us, an aching pleasure that gives me no respite. Love cannot be contained. The neat packaging of desire splits asunder, spilling crimson through my days. LEYLA: Long, languishing days that are now bruised tender with yearning, spent searching for a fingerprint, a scent, a breath you left behind. [Doorbell rings] Rani, where are my parents? They just finished lunch, Miss. I gave Madam some mint tea. Go in. ["Holy Daughter" by Leonie Casanova plays] REEMA: Maybe I should try a South American maid. As long as it's a third-world country, I don't mind where it is. They work hard. They don't even think about... Mama, Baba, I have something I need to tell you. Haven't you shamed us enough already?! [Reema cries] Please, Reema. Tala! Tala, wait. "The sun hit her hand with a red-hot force that burned straight through the clear-veined skin of her wrist. And when she shut her eyes tightly and briefly against it, the heat still glowed under eyelids like coals." [Applause] Thank you, Leyla, for a very illuminating talk and reading. If anyone would like a signed copy, Leyla has kindly agreed to do a signing. [Applause] I really loved it, especially the ending. That's nice to hear. Most people just love it when it ends. [Laughs] - Thank you. - Thank you. Hi. Amina, please. Amina. Quite a unique name. Thank you. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. Who shall I make it out to? "To Tala... ...who finally had the courage to come out to her parents." Thank you. What did you tell them? I told them I was in love with a beautiful, intelligent... . . talented, clumsy... . . woman. I'm sorry we had to go to a hotel last night. We won't from next week. I'm getting my own place. Mabrouk! Congratulations! Is it a flat? One bedroom. What is it? I was just thinking... You're gonna need a bigger place. Why? Because I told my parents we're gonna have children. One day. Soon. Children? Soon. ["I Kissed A Girl" by Jill Sobule plays] She's what? But some of my best friends are Lebanese!
