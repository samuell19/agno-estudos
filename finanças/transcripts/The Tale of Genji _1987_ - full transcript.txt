Oh, this is rather unexpected. Old man don't bother We have come away to hide. What meal shall we prepare Lord Genji? Your master is Lord Genji? Well, who said such a thing? They say Lord Genji is the Emperor's second prince. Nothing rivals him in the Capital. At last, spring has come for my lady. How often have I come to you? You never tell me about yourself... ...and you never ask about me. Why is that? i would be content if you could remember me... ...as a woman in the house of evening blossoms. Yugao, why are you scared? Is it meaningless to talk to me? Perhaps I am unreliable. It has been four years. I have sent away my new-born child. It should not have been born. I regret asking you. Please forgive me. Now, the only thing I see is... ...a dream of my daughter always as a baby. My mother also died in the spring, when I was three. When I am with you, I wonder why I always think of my past. At last, I may have found the one to share my soul. Tale of Genji Today, you attend the Imperial Court. It might snow. And if it snows? The Court does not mind if I attend or not. Too much walking at night is not healthy. A gift from the Minister of the Left. It is delicious fruits and sweets. I must remember to visit more frequently. You must go since Lady Aoi is there. We are husband and wife. Maybe we are not two matched shells. It is good to see you. It has been a long time, father. How is your back pain? Lord Genji, the medicated bath remedy you sent me worked. It is a great honor for an old man like me... ...to talk to you face to face. If it is possible, please come more often. I have the honor of... ..voicing his Majesty's concern. It is a shame you serve as a commoner. Father Older people's complaining is not really appreciated. But, is it to end like this? Lord Genji, let us drink tonight. Do not let Aoi hear this, but I want to gossip about women. The gossip is about you, To no Chujo? You cannot keep their letters in a Chinese box. Is my daughter ready? My Lady is ill. She will not be able to... Lord Genji is here. Please forgive me. Hurry! Bring the sake. I cannot stay for long. That I regret. Lord Genji says take care of yourself. To avoid misfortune, he departs for Kiinomori's mansion. He does not need to come on a day like this. I feel asleep. You looked so peaceful. In my dream your harp... ...accompanies my flute. When I first heard you play the harp... ...I wondered how you could match your beautiful music... ...to the beat of my heart. You mean, you've been enchanted by my harp and not me. They say music is the reflection of one's soul. You linger among the shallow pools of light.. ...While I dwell in the darkness. Someday I will accompany your harp. When you are feeling passionate... ...you are selfish to force me. But once your hunger is sated, you become gentle. Passions reflect the seasons, and I change as they do. Dawn is breaking. You must go. You do not have to rush me. I do not care if anyone sees me. Even the Emperor knows about us. You must visit His Majesty often so he won't think I detained you. I know there are many other places you have to go. Your youthfulness has always affected me. I am six years your senior The late Crown Prince and I had a daughter. Now I can never be your wife. Before the warmth inside me cools, I will return to you. You don't mean that. You think so little of yourself, though I said I will return. That is what you probably hate about me. Miyasudokoro, Well, you should go. The servants are ready. Speaking of women... ...it is difficult to find the ideal wife. If I could give what little experience I have... ...it is nice to watch... ...upper class women grow up pampered by attendants... ...but if you know them you find they lack personality. Yet, some people of humble status could also be suspect. But, if I find a good girl from a quiet middle class home... ...I will be very happy. I see that the unexpected sharpens your interest in her. Women who are too kind soon make their husbands faithless. Frankly, strong-minded women forget their charm. We all have different tastes. By the way, the Court continues to be unlucky. What about you, Genji? We want to hear about your adventures. Yes, I want to hear too. I have nothing to say. You are joking! You do not know how many girls who hear your name... ...blush and get excited. The dried fish tastes stale. Do not change the topic. I heard from the maids... ...that the Emperor has ordered prayers for Empress Fujitsubo. What happened? She was in poor health and has left Court for Sanjo mansion. Is that so? No. Never... Never again will I repeat those sins. You remember...that night a year ago. I do not want to remember. Your hair smells the same as on that night. I am your Father's wife. I am your stepmother too. Then why did you accept me? Surely, you... I... Perhaps it was my fault. Because of this, I am ready to accept the blame... ...but I shall not betray the Emperor again. Do not talk of Father. What happened that evening is a secret between the two of us. I am here at last. Let us vanish forever into... ...the dream we dream tonight! Please... Please leave! Please... Will you stop tormenting me? At times, I am not sure of myself. I cannot hold back my feelings. You are my stepmother. My Father's Empress. I cannot break the law. But, why must my love for you be a sad one? Lord Genji. My sister had aged. She always worried about my granddaughter. She secured the child's future. She loved her so much. She felt sorry for her. I wondered if i should mention such back luck, Lord Genji. I appreciate your candor. I always worried about the Nun's health as well. Last summer I had an attack of malaria... ...that brought me here to recuperate. Bishop. I know this is unexpected... ...but could I care for Murasaki? Lord Genji. Actually I spoke to the nun about Princess Murasaki. She was afraid that the princess was too young. At her age I had lost my mother and grandmother. I cannot ignore her loss. What are your plans for her? Nevertheless... ...her father Hyobukyo has a new wife and children. He hardly comes here at all. By no means am I acting on an impulse or whim. We are forever grateful fr your consideration but... ...as my sister told you, Murasaki still cannot speak for herself. Princess... Where is she? She was just with me but no matter where we look... ...the princess is hopeless... ...the moment you take your eyes away. Lord Hikaru Lord Genji went after Murasaki. I do not know if he is serious. What happened? Looks like she went that way. She really is quick. Isn't she? You are just slow. Look over there. Oh. my... My brother. Lord Hikaru. What is going on? I kept that sparrow in the basket. Inuki let it get away. I followed it here and caught it. An animal was after it? Even though it was tame. Lord Genji. Koremitsu. A retainer from Hyobukyo. What? Hyobukyo's retainer is waiting for Murasaki. Come with me. With you? I like you so much. Good, it is settled. Lord Genji. My big brother. You should rest. I am not tired. I want to play kickball. Murasaki, do you like girl's things... ...like dolls? How come I cannot play kickball? Even you get in trouble with her, Lord Genji. Why don't you ask To no Chujo to play kickball? No, no. I have a bad back. Koremitsu. That is a splendid idea. She is well taken care of and raised to be your type of lady. Right? That is not it at all. She has no relatives to care for her. Even so, she resembles... ...Empress Fujitsubo. Though the Princess is so young... ...around the eyes and mouth, she is quite... Don't you think so? When I first met her at the hermitage... ...I could not give her up to anyone. The Empress is pregnant? I heard that she left Court and is in bed expecting a child. Oh, this is good news. The Emperor looks much younger. Please be patient. I am never allowed to take you to... No mater what...No matter what, I want to see her. Please, my Lord. Myobu... Empress Fujitsubo is pregnant with the Emperor's child. The Emperor's child. Then it is true. Please wait. Be patient. Father. Did you hear? Lord Genji... ...was promoted because the Emperor praised his dancing. It was a wonderful dance. Our son is the Emperor's first prince. Lord Genji, born by a courtier, is the Emperor's favorite. Though he is a retainer... ...the Emperor only has eyes for Lord Genji. Mother, Lord Genji is a great and gentle person. I wonder if the Emperor has considered abdication? You cannot ask him to... If Empress's child is a boy, I will arrange the Emperor's... ...retirement as soon as possible. It has been so long... ...and you have been so ill. We have not... ...seen each other. Do you feel better? Why did you come? Why must you ask? We are husband and wife. Nijo mansion seems very lively... If you mean that young lady, I never... I do not want to hear of it. Aoi. What? I wonder if beautiful babies resemble each other. When I look at the young prince, I see you as a child. Congratulations on the birth of the young prince. It is not bad that I am still living. It is a gift to be this happy at my age. I have always made things hard for you. I thank you for always watching over me. I made you a retainer... ...to protect you from conflict. In the future, as a Councilor you must help rule the country. As a retainer, I better understand the government. I have not forgotten Father's words. The time for me to step aside may have come. Do not say such timid things. He looks just like you when you were small. What a beautiful spring night, though the light of... ...the moon shines dimly through the clouds. Who is it? It is useless to cry out. No matter what I do, I am allowed to do it. You are Lord Genji, aren't you? Fate, in the guise of the half-clouded moon... ...has brought us together. Please, tell me... ...your name so I can send you letters tomorrow. If that is the way you feel, then search for it yourself. Rumors will spread if I do that. Well, please answer me. Don't be in such a hurry or I'll disappear into the night. I know. I will certainly find you... To remember tonight, let us exchange fans. Which princess is this? I am sure she is one of Kokiden's sisters but... ...the fourth one is married. The sixth one must marry Togu soon. Someone, please light a torch. Lady Aoi? They say she is pregnant. Really? Carts full of gifts stand in front of the Minister's mansion. That is terrible. That must be why we have not seen Lord Genji recently. Since the situation has not changed... Will Lady Rokujo go to Ise with her daughter? Rokujo cannot beat Lady Aoi's pregnancy. Move it! Movie it! No, you move it! This is a noble carriage. Why are you so arrogant? Listen to me! This is the late Crown Prince's wife, the Lady Rokujo! This is Lord Genji's honorable wife, the Lady Aoi! She had fallen asleep from the herbal medicine. How is the unborn child? It is fine. The servants were drunk and had a pointless carriage match. Everyone knows about it in the Court. It was Lady Rokujo. Is it painful? It is probably a malign spirit. A malign spirit... My Lady! Please leave us. My daughter still relies on you. Do not lose yourself. Everything will be all right. I will be by your side, so do not worry. No...it is not so... ...prayers do me great harm. Please slow them a little. I never expected to wander about such a place as this. When I cannot endure missing you... ...sometimes it happens that my soul goes astray. Who are you? You know.. Bind the hem of my robe to keep my soul within... ...keep my grief from wandering through the skies. My Lady, are you all right? My Lady. Get water! Birth is near! More prayers. It is born! It is a boy! Lady Miyasudokoro. It does not go away. No matter how many times I wash... that poppy seed smell. Fire invocation. I can bring you water. It does not go away... It never goes away. I named the young one, Yugiri. Are you pleased with it? It feels like a dream. We do not know each other, yet we have a child. Aoi. I wonder if this child did not... ...want to be born because I had so much pain. Thinking that I was about to lose you... ...I did not feel like living. I felt for the first time... ...that I could never replace you. What is wrong? Ah...my breast milk. Our son has a wet nurse, so my milk is worthless. Today I must go to the Autumn Court. I will return soon. Farewell. Get well quickly. Nothing will make Yugiri happier than to be held by his mother. Dear.. We have finally become more like husband and wife. What is wrong? Lady Aoi...Lady Aoi! Tell me about Aoi. Aoi... These clouds might be mingled with the smoke from her pyre. The smoke fills my heart with feelings too deep for words. Lord Hikaru has not returned recently. Since his great misfortune, he has isolated himself. I see. He does not speak to me at all. I am able to cheer him up a little. My Princess has become very grown up. Shonagon...will Lord Hikaru and I become husband and wife? Yes... It certainly will be that way. If that is so, will I always be waiting for him to return? You have a lot of pretty hair. I was led by my constant heart and I have crossed the bar. Are you sure that you want to go to Ise? Abandon me? I knew it. You came to my house that time. You saw me washing my hair to rid myself of the mustard smell. I was too young... ..to feel the depth of your sorrow. After coming to Nonomiya shrine... ...I cleansed my body by bathing in moonlight. Lord Genji. Once more, let us start over again. Do you mind the chattering rumors of the Capital? If it is so... That first night I spent with you... ...you left marks on my arm that did not disappear. I must learn to stop loving you. I have to. Can you do it? To tell you the truth... ...being separated from you was so painful. You came for me. You stopped me from going to Ise. That is enough for me to decide to go to Ise. Thank you very much. Miyasudokoro... An autumn farewell needs nothing to make it sadder. And enough of your dismal songs, crickets. Farewells at dawn are always drenched in dew... ...but never has the autumn sky seemed so sad. I have something to ask of you. For my sake... ...Father, please do not... It is about the young Crown Prince and Fujitsubo. Genji... ...please, you must protect the young prince from the Court. I will also ask my brother for help. Fujitsubo, come here. Mother.. Crown Prince.. I have a request.. What is it? I want to hear your harp. My... And your flute, Genji. Won't both of you play together for me? Father. At this particular Court visit, It was certain that... ...no one from the family of the Left would get promoted. When the white rainbow crossed the sun... ...the Crown Prince trembled. What a thing to say. The white rainbow crossed the sun. He cannot be accusing him of treason? The Emperor is too generous to the Right. It is becoming difficult to live at the Court. If you pray at Higashiyama, you may receive divine favors. Splendid. Let us try it. Please forgive me. I was eager to see you. I came swiftly on a horse. Even Myobu does not know. I crept into the darkness. Please do not abandon me. Stay with me. What happened to you? The Cherry Blossoms dance. Cherry Blossoms... Have you lost your mind? You have to get a hold of yourself. Only you can help the Crown Prince. He is our son, isn't he? Genji... If you fall into Hell, I will go with you. You..if only you stayed with me. I had heard from the late Emperor... ...I had a vision that I resembled your mother. I do not remember... ...I have no memory of my mother. Is it really me... ...that you are seeking? Why are you saying this to me? What is wrong? You look so lonely... ...Lord Hikaru. I was thinking of my childhood. Please tell me. It was unpleasant. I would like to know more about you...Lord Hikaru. My mother died on this day. The cherry blossoms were in full bloom. My mother's white arms suddenly pulled away...then I was... ...running frantically in the cherry blossoms. No...I am not that certain. Perhaps it was an illusion. I was afraid of cherry blossoms. I felt that the cherry blossoms took my mother away. I buried all the petals I gathered... ...into a hole of a large cherry blossom tree. When I met Fujitsubo, she looked like the cherry blossom petals. Even now, I see the cherry blossoms dance. And each time, a loved one disappears from my arms... ...I have an announcement. Today, by her own decision, the Empress Fujitsubo... ...became a Nun to serve Buddha. Why? Why does everybody leave me? Sixth Princess. How are you? It is my father! The Emperor is concerned about you. Has the fever gone away? Yes..I am much better. I brought some medicine. Oh..you have a red complexion. Your fever has not gone down yet. No, I am all right. Who is there? You... The rose blooms only briefly... ..at the dawn to wilt in the summer rains. Even though I told her to behave herself... ...many times, Genji's arrogance continues. She was to have the Emperor's baby. Genji seems unafraid of the Emperor or the Gods. I heard that he still sends letters to Miyasudokoro. What arrogance! But... Keep these things between us. If the Emperor knew, the princess.... Father, this is a good reason. I cannot believe that Genji disgraced her in my mansion. I only think of revenge for the Emperor. Empress Mother! I do not mean... But Father, you hate him too, don't you? Then we will wait for our chance to remove Genji from power. Did you find out? No, I am sorry. You did not ask correctly. No one knows their former neighbor's new address. And love confused the men of old... ...who traveled this new and strange road. Yugao. You are seeking your old love. You are quite disappointed aren't you? Yugao had a small mole on her neck. No, it could be another lady. You cannot remember... Too much has happened. How come I forget? I have always been true. If you had been true just once, you would not be in trouble. Where did they all go? Is it really me that you are seeking? What am I looking for? Why do you confuse me? Who are you? Oh, Lord Genji will be exiled? I often hear such rumors. Rumors about Kokiden's sister... What, the Emperor's favorite princess? He is so dangerous. If he was allowed to rule, he would ruin our country. Once exiled, he loses everything and must leave the Capital. Crown Prince, those who could protect you have all left Court. Forgive me. The groundskeepers are free to leave or remain. Here are the titles to my manors and the keys to the storehouses. All will be turned over to you. Please take me with you. Suma is different from Kyo. It is a lonely village echoing with the sounds of waves. I will be an outcast. I cannot take you there. I only want to be with you! Lord Hikaru, I can rely upon no one else except you. Please take me with you! Murasaki...please understand. I want you to remain here as my wife to look after things. And... ...please take care of my son Yugiri, too. He already lost his mother. I left him at his grandfather's. It is a selfish request. You have always been so kind to me. It will be hard to be separated from you for even a moment. Not knowing your kindness would be better than this sadness. I never expected that such a day would come. We thought that through our vows... ...nothing could ever part us. As long as you know I am here, you will return safely. Is that true? Yes.. I will return for you. Lord Hikaru, I will stay here... ...because you will return. I would gladly give my life... ...to purchase a single moment of your delay. Murasaki.
