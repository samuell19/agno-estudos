Watch out. They're not rabbits. I think. That way. Very good, yes. That way. The elephants are over there. Sorry. Watch out. Christ Almighty. Christ. Is it Michiels? No, it's Dees. It's Dees Van Paemel. -Is he dead? -No, he's still moving. -Who was it? -Mr. Maurice, the idiot. It's your brother. It's Dees. You must forgive us, sir. -What's his name? -Désiré. -We'll get you to hospital. -Leave it to my father. Leave it. Out of the way! Let me take a look. Dees! It could've been worse. He could have been dead! Relax. It was an accident. He'll survive. He's strong. -Give me a drink. I'm shaking. -It's not your fault. -Take him home in the carriage. -In the carriage? He's still bleeding. It's only a bit of blood. Here, give him this. To cover expenses. -A louis? -Hmm, that's what it costs. Friends, don't let that unfortunate incident spoil the day. Come on. Be careful, be careful. Be careful. This way. Here. To cover expenses. Expenses? Yes. That's the price. Look. It hasn't been shot. But it's dead. Masko, Masko. If the baron were to find out. What do you mean? How can you see it's one of the baron's? For Dees. It'll do him good. Oh, no! Is there something wrong with Eduard? Eduard has been sacked from the factory. I really thought that… VIOLENT STRIKE IS SPREADING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY That's outrageous. They're making demands now. D'you start in the morning now? There's nothing better for a hangover. Your mother should've left you in Holland. Gee-up! Come on, Marianne. Come on. Look! He looks better. -He doesn't eat enough. -He can't eat anymore. Cordulle, the constable! He looks like he's in a hurry. Damn… What have you been up to now? -Me? -Yes, you. With your filthy socialists. What good news? Good news? A constable doesn't bring that very often. I've got a document here about one Kamiel Van Paemel. It says that on the 17th, that's the day after tomorrow, eh, he must report to his army unit without delay. Damn and blast! Has he been called up? Yes. With the classes of 86 and 87. They're leaving from the town hall. Is it because of the strike? Of course it's because of the strike. Everywhere is in an uproar. Strikers protest and policemen shoot. -They're not going to bring in the army? -If the policemen can't cope. Oh Lord, oh Lord. Just when we've got a lot of work. Why don't the policemen just shoot the bastards? Those people are standing up for their rights. Rights? What rights? It's all you and your brother talk about. The law and justice are not on your side. Things aren't easy. Yes! Got him. He won't get stuck between the baron's teeth. -He weighs at least 3 kilos. -Too much for the baron. It would give him indigestion. Hey, look over there. Romanie? Romanie! Romanie! It's probably poachers. What shall I do? What do you want to do? You've got three choices. You can go, obey and say yes. It's Masko. -What's he up to? -He's poaching fish. Look over there. -We've got him. -Stay calm. Put a sack over the fish. Stay here. I said, stay here. I told you. Keep calm. -How is he? -Balls hurt. Come on. Who put that hare here? It's for you. Don't want it. We've got enough trouble. -He wanted to help. -We don't need it. And you, did you hear that? Yes, Father. Make sure you don't let that troublemaker tell you what to do. He can go shoot the workers, too. Hopefully they will shoot those layabouts. Those layabouts want to work. But they don't want to starve. Socialist rubbish. I'd like to know what you'd do in their shoes. I'd do some work! I'd work until I dropped. I feel sorry for your wife and children. It's not his fault. He didn't start striking, then? He's one of the leaders. -I'm off. -No, Eduard! No, lad. No! Children should do as they are told. That's what we were taught. He won't understand what is happening. He can't understand it. Eduard? Be careful. Next! Next! Yes. Next! Yes! Next! Buelens! Are you messing me about on purpose? Or are you a coward? What are you going to do if the socialists throw stones? "Thanks, Mr. Socialist, for throwing a stone?" Bloody idiot! It wouldn't surprise me if you were a red, too. Who, when it comes down to it, lets his mates do all the dirty work. You probably aren't the only one who doesn't give a rap for the army. But when you go to demonstrations it's to keep order! Understand? All together: "Yes, sergeant!" Yes, sergeant. In accordance with state regulations. Understand? Yes, sergeant. Those who are against the state have got us to deal with! -Understand? -Yes, sergeant. -What's happening? -The strikers from La Louisiana. There are 160 of them! Put a few more men along Moermanstraat! We mustn't provoke them. Did you warn Mr. De Denterghem? Yes. Twice, Mr. De Saintsecri. -We won't see Albin. -He's probably wetting himself. Not everyone is as brave as you. They're coming, gentlemen. Let's see what the organised proletariat looks like. Get ready to shoot. Down with capitalism! We'll fight to the death! -Orderly bunch. -Not like abroad. That's where the danger lies. Gentlemen of this factory! As peace-loving citizens we ask you to think about our poverty! Your indifference to social problems is disgraceful. Go on, you bloody idiot! So we want to give you a petition! No way! We are protesting against how badly we are treated! Shoulder arms! Isn't that Van Paemel's oldest? There, on the right. Bloody hell, it is. We demand three centimes rise to be able to live! Don't do it! No! That's just what they want. Attention! No! Don't! Firing in the air is ridiculous. Stop! For Christ's sake, stop! Stop! Bloody idiot… Now they've got their first hero. Don't shoot. I haven't done anything, soldier. -He must have gone that way. -No, that way. A right fiasco. In some places they set light to factories. We should use dynamite. They have to realise that we are becoming a force to be reckoned with. Great force. And what have we achieved? Look over there. -Our time will come. -Yes, and pigs might fly. A right fiasco. Bloody hell! -Get out of here with that child. -Where shall I go? I don't care what you do. -It's easy for you to say. -Naughty, eh? When they cry with hunger he walks out the door. -Damn. -What's the matter? A bloody soldier. Are you pleased about what you've done? -Is my brother Eduard here? -No. Nor is your mother. -Throw him out. -It's my brother. It's our Kamiel, Irma. Is it? I've run away. Yes… That doesn't do anyone any good. I couldn't take it anymore. You're mad. -They'll throw you in the slammer. -They're welcome to. I can't do it anymore. You'll get yourself and everyone else into trouble. I can't shoot people. And they'll make me. A deserter? They don't think that's funny. Right. Where is he? And don't play the innocent. He's not here. I haven't seen him for weeks, I tell you. For weeks. He can't have run away. He wouldn't do that. Our Eduard isn't here. We're looking for Kamiel. -Kamiel? -Why would we be looking for Eduard? Who are you? Her lover? Come on, get up. Get up! -You have to do as I say. -Let go. No! Christ! I can hardly move. Otherwise I'd show them. The bastards. All of them. Go on, lay down. Those bloody stupid peasants. If I weren't so kind-hearted I'd have taken them both with me. Van Paemel! You've got serious problems. Your oldest is a communist against Church and state. And the other is a deserter. Tell your son to give himself up. The army slammer isn't a hotel. If I see him, I'll bring him myself. I'm not letting the coward back in. Damn. Damn! Hey, come here you. Come on. Come here, darlin', come on. Masko? -Masko? -Kamiel? Christ. Where have you come from? -I'm exhausted. -What's happened? We'll take care of you. Lots of pepper on it. Pine needles. Where did you get this from? I was a legionnaire. Here, a German bullet. The war in '70. They'll be worried about me at home. They'd be more worried if they knew you were here. That smells good. The baron could follow the smell. He doesn't come here anymore. Since the game-keeper hung himself here. -Here? -There. What took you so long? I bumped into someone unexpectedly in the woods. -Who? -A friend, a mate. -Who? -I brought him with me. What? Where? Here. Help me. Bloody hell, Masko. That's the brains of farmer Verharen's runaway pig. That's no way to behave, stealing animals. But Cordulle, that pig was running round on the baron's land. So it belongs to the baron. But as the baron doesn't know, he can't be robbed. Oh, you idiot. How do I explain it to father? If he's out in the field, you can cook the head and make brawn. He's looking at us. Who's that? The good-for-nothing Van Paemel. The rabble-rouser. What's he doing here? In this country, where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law, in some states you can stake out huge areas of land and call them your property. In America, class distinction… -Mr. Maurice! -…exploitation and -- -Good heavens, what a stink! -That's the pile of manure. You're… How…? -I see you're much better. -I'm not complaining. -I suppose you're still mad at me? -No. Not at all. Right. Would you like a drink, Mr. Maurice? A glass of milk? -Miss Danielle? -No, thank you. The reason why we've come… My mother would greatly appreciate it if your youngest daughter… If Romanie would come to the castle this afternoon. Why? To help. There's not enough staff for a reception. But sir, we've got so much work here. Is it really necessary? Mother says that she only trusts girls that she knows. She can learn nice manners that way. What use are nice manners to us peasants? -They're no good to us. -Yes, they are! They help you get on. Hello, Mr. Maurice. Miss Danielle. See, young people see it differently. Yes, that's arranged. At two o'clock. Mother will be pleased. Father? Father! I wanted to ask whether you've any news of Kamiel? I don't want to hear any. Gee-up! What's the matter with Kamiel? -Has he been home? -No. And if he does come, I'll kick him out the door. A thousand young men go into the army and do their duty. Why can't he? Because you've put the wrong ideas in his head. Because of you and your brother I'll be in trouble up at the manor. Go back to your socialists. Your place is no longer here with us. -Are you mad? -Shut your mouth, you! If I need your advice I'll ask for it. We don't need your rabble-rousing talk here. Gee-up! -I didn't want to talk to the old man. -Just see his daughter. -Cordulle? -No, the little blond one. On the farm. Romanie. She's lovely, isn't she? She's okay. If you so much as lay a finger on her I'll kill you. Hello, Mr. Maurice. Miss Danielle. I'll get him. Leave me alone. Goodbye, my faithful friend Goodbye, my friend is leaving Goodbye, my faithful friend He's leaving, but God will see -There used to be two. -What do you mean? -I killed one. -Why? -I sometimes do strange things. -What sort of things? This, for example. What's the matter, Maurice? Are you mad? -Are you mad? -Don't you dare. Shit. Romanie. Romanie! Stop standing around. Take the petits fours upstairs. Go on. I said, go on. Take that apron off and roll down your sleeves. Watch out. Here, come on. Right, upstairs. God, she's slow. Mr. Maurice? Are you ill? Go away. Leave me alone. Enter. I can't sleep. Why not? Look. I found it after the party. Real silk. You're sweating. Tell me. What was it like? It was wonderful. Lots of elegant people. And all those clothes… Dees, there was an orchestra. I tried some champagne. What do you want to tell me? -I keep thinking of Mr. Maurice. -Why? Romanie… When he looks at you, it's for other reasons than you think. I know, I know. But… -I keep thinking of him. -Don't start getting ideas. It's not our world. -He's unhappy. -He's engaged. You've been there, you've seen it. Now it's over. You should try to eat more. If that doesn't improve you'll have to go to hospital. It's already much better. The baron's here! -There's no one here. -They'll be out in the field. -Who is the agitator? -Him there. We've been indoors. But your wife isn't there. She must be there, Baron. She's probably resting. See? They're asleep. Mother, hurry up! Cordulle! Romanie! Filomène, hurry up. Given your wife's age, I can understand that. But your daughters should only sleep at night. But sir, we've been preparing flax for eight days. From three in the morning until half past ten at night. Well, sir and madam, it's hot, isn't it? -Would you like a glass of milk? -No, don't bother. I'd like to employ your youngest daughter to train her as a chambermaid. It's not possible, madam. What would we do about all the work? We can't do without her here. Not even for a day. She will bring in money. -Madam, we can't. -And yet I insist she comes. Van Paemel. Next week. If you say so, madam. -If we have no choice. -Right, that's sensible. Don't get cross. It's a great honour for her. She will have a better future. Cordulle will do all the work. While you play at being a lady. -With those bloodsuckers. -I don't want to stay a peasant. Van Paemel, the real reason why I've come… According to my solicitor, who has looked into the cost of living, -you live here too cheaply. -Too cheaply? But… According to the solicitor there should be an annual increase of 500 franks. Five hundred franks? But sir, that would ruin us. I already pay too much rent now. Look… I'll be honest. If you don't pay an extra 500 franks I'll find another tenant immediately. Who? Whoever I want. Right. I'll mention one name. Farmer Landuyt. Landuyt has his own yard. His son is getting married. He agreed straight away. -That's harsh. -Think about it. But not for too long. Because I have to give Landuyt an answer. Gee-up! I wish I were dead. What are you going to do? Work, lad. Work until I collapse. Father… I'll help you. No, lad. No. I can. Honestly. You're very quiet, lad. You didn't say anything on the farm. -No, Mother. -No, Mother. No, Mother. What does that mean? Are you pleased? Yes, Mother. Hey, Barabas. Don't you recognise me? Kamiel. Good evening. Can I come in? Hello, Masko. Cordulle won't be long. And Van Paemel? He's gone to the solicitor. Have something to eat? -No, we haven't got time. -We? Yes. A mate is waiting outside. Bring him in. Who is it? Kamiel? Hello, Mother. -Where have you been all this time? -He was staying in a hotel. But… Brother! Good God. -He's been with Masko. -I've looked after him well, haven't I? Masko, you idiot. All that time and you didn't tell me. If I'd told you I might as well have advertised it in the paper. Dees will be surprised. -Where is he? -In bed. He's had another stomach bleed. He wanted to go out in the field with Father. Quiet. He's just gone to sleep. Have something to eat. It's bacon. What are you going to do now? You can't live in the woods. -You're not to give yourself up? -Might be better. Never. With those strikes? Say it! Mother… Mother… I can't have something to eat. I think… I think I'll go to America. No… To Uncle Justin. When? Tomorrow. Tomorrow morning. At four o'clock. Is that why you came here? To tell us that? And you have to leave now? Immediately? -Tonight? -I have to be in Antwerp by four. -The boat leaves at five. -And we're already late. No. I'm just taking him there. Well, go then. Go now. I don't want to see you again. Ever. I'll write. I'll write often. I promise. We've got to go, Kamiel. I really will write often. What are you doing here? Do you want there to be an accident? Put that sack on your shoulders, man. Get that cart out of there. That cart out of there! Can't you hear properly? Hey, what are you doing here? Picking up my guano. Can't you see? -Leave it alone! You're not on list A. -What list? This one. Those on list A get guano, the others don't. -What sort of rubbish is that? -Complain to the baron. Damn it. Van Paemel, take your hands off that guano. You're on list B. -You aren't going to make a fuss, right? -And Devroe? And Konings? -List A. -I ordered some. -I ordered it in time. There's enough. -Didn't you hear me? List B. List B? I need some fertilizer. Leave it alone! If you don't like it, the place to go is the manor. But I don't advise you to go there. -Bloody hell! -Get that cart over here. Bloody hell! All because I can't pay the increase. It's impossible. I can't. Eduard feels wretched because he can't come home. You reap what you sow. He could help you, couldn't he? You came to help load the guano. Nothing else. I don't need any socialists. -Are you pleased, Romanie? -Yes. Then there's at least one person who's pleased. Giddy-up! Princess… Unfortunately, this is where our ways part. Be careful, princess. Because where you're going there are hidden problems. My land is there. Who's afraid of the big bad wolf? The big bad wolf, the big bad wolf. Come on, they're there. Eduard! Eduard! Go back! All roads to the market are blocked. It's a forbidden demonstration! By order of the mayor! Dees! Dees! Dees! Dees! Dees! Dees! This is the end of civilisation. Those proletarians want to overthrow the establishment. -Would you like a cognac? -No. Oh, okay, go on. Thank you, for your first day here. I don't know what's preventing me from throwing you out right away. -Your nice brother, the communist. -It's not her fault. We'll get him. We'll get him. Say that the baron said so. We're going to wipe them all out, every single one. Aren't you being just a bit unfair? Drink your drink. Tell your father that my patience is at an end. I'm not waiting any longer for him to pay! Tell Simone to make some tea. Some people have been killed. Twenty-six dead! It's all the fault of those communists! Calm down. I haven't done anything wrong. No. He's a monster. But he doesn't bite. No one will send you away. I'm here, too. Yes, Mr. Maurice. No… I've got to go. They can see us. Let go. For a long time I've wondered why you act the way you do. Now I know. You're ill. Tomorrow this door will close. For good. Mr. Maurice? -Can I tempt you? -No. May I come in? Maybe we can create one moment of happiness. Forget everything, wipe everything out. I've brought something with me for that. Although I must admit it rarely helps. That's for you. -No. -Go on… -No, leave me… -Go on, Romanie. No! Whose is this? My sister's. She's been dead for years, hasn't she? Mr. Maurice? Drowned by accident, you mean? Like they let everyone believe? My sister and I… We understood each other better than anyone else in the world. We were always together, throughout our youth. But then… When we were grown up, my mother… was suddenly suspicious of our relationship. She involved my father. They sent me to Holland. Isabelle stayed here. And one evening… Very brave, eh. Brave. She drowned herself. A Scotsman sees another Scotsman in Scotland pulling the wallpaper off the wall. He asks, "Are you going to wallpaper?" "No, I'm going to move." Your Eduard is a real villain. Isabelle… It could get better eventually. But I wouldn't count on it. Eventually? Yes, he's in quite a bad way. And then there's his stomach. That's the problem. If only we could look in that stomach. He'll have to struggle on with it. It's my fault. He said, "I want to go to that demonstration. I want Eduard to see that someone supports him." I should have stopped him. Is someone there? Get out of here! -Christ! -Masko! Did you hurt yourself? -Down here, you. -We're getting married in October. Get down here! -We're not doing any harm. -Get off my farm. For good. -We're getting married in October. -Leave it, Cordulle. If you want. You won't see me again. -Masko, you're not going to… -I won't come here again. Until October. Then I'll come and get her, Van Paemel. For good then, too. Why aren't you going with him? You slut. What would you do without me? I don't want to be duped by my own children. There are visitors for: Fiks, Demaire, Vandermeyen, Detaeye, Liechtenschai, Careme, Van Paemel, Masy… Hello. Zenobie. Cordulle. I'm really pleased to see someone from home. -And how are things at home? -Fine, fine. Pol is doing his best at school. What did the board say? The strikes are over. The dead died for nothing. How's Father? You know him. He'll never change. Masko wants to get married as quickly as possible. Before October. I can't leave Father and Mother on their own with all the work. Dees can't help. -And Romanie? -We don't see her much. She'd rather play at being princess at the manor. I can't stay long. We're starting retting. -Retting? Who with? -The whole family. Father and me. Van Paemel, have you got a moment? Van Paemel, I've always been well-disposed towards you. Look, Mr. Bailiff. If it's about the increase in the rent, it's simple, I can't pay it. I'm ruined. I'm flat broke. A hard-working farmer like you can't be. Can't be? I am. Cordulle, he's exaggerating again. If he says we haven't got anything, then we haven't. The baron has got wealthier through my work and I'm ruined. But you let it drag on. You've got exactly three weeks. In three weeks' time I have to auction off all your belongings. -Bastards. -Be quiet, you. Is that my reward for working like a Trojan for 33 years? -It's the law. -The law, the law… Is there a law that says we have to be persecuted the way we are? -Who makes that law? -We don't. We don't. Come on, control yourself. Will you always like me? Mr. Maurice? I told you, didn't I? But even if something went… "We left with 160 emigrants on a big ship. You've no idea how big it was. You've no idea, how big it was. But many were taken ill. I wasn't. In New York Uncle Justin was waiting for me. We went by train to his farm. It took days. Sometimes it takes us a whole day to round up all the animals." Doesn't he write that he's ashamed of running away from the army like a coward? Carry on reading, Cordulle. "I've written to Eduard to say he should come to America when he's let out. He can earn a good wage here." The Americans will be pleased to see him. A rabble-rouser from the slammer. But they're all like that there. "I ask you again to forgive me…" Dear parents, for the sorrow I have caused you. This is how I end my letter. Your devoted son, Kamiel Van Paemel. "Sun… Sundance. 2nd August, 1888." Is that everything? Yes. Read it again, Cordulle. "Dear Father and Mother…" Brothers and Sisters. I've picked up my pen to tell you about the state of my health. Having to leave you hurt me and, I know, you very much. Calm down. They won't eat you. Better keep your apron on. You're still personnel. She should have kept her knickers on. Sit down, Romanie. It's a delicate business. But we're not going to lecture you. It's happened and we have to face up to things. Knowing that Maurice is about to get married… -you provoked him anyway. -What did I do? You thought you could use the oldest trick in the book to hold on to him. To force him to marry you. Never. Be quiet, Romanie. Don't interrupt the baron. That's not allowed. Don't think I can't see what you really want. You're a Van Paemel. They've already caused us enough problems. -When is the child due? -Don't be so cross with her. I think in six months' time. Isn't it? Yes, madam. We've discussed the matter with the priest. It would be best if you got married as quickly as possible. To Jules there. I don't know the bloke. You'll get to know him. He's a hard-working gardener. You could live in the gardener's house. You'll never get a chance like that again. And… What does Mr. Maurice think? It's the only solution. All I want to ask, sir… Speak up, Jules. Say what's bothering you. That relationship with Romanie… -It must be over. -Of course. And no one will ever tell the child -who its real father is. -That goes without saying. Well, Romanie… That's sorted out then, isn't it? Everything will be kept to ourselves. No one will know a thing. You're a coward, Mr. Maurice. Sorry? What did you say? You're forgetting where you are. Apologise immediately. You slut! You whore! Pack your case, and quick! -I will. -I don't want to see you ever again! And I don't want to see you either or I'll stick a pitchfork in your fat belly. Fifteen francs for this farmer's cart? Who'll offer more? Seventeen francs to sir. 18? Twenty-five to sir. Anyone more than 25? Twenty-six? 26, any more? Twenty-seven… 30. Thirty to sir. Thirty-five. Twenty-two. Twenty-two to sir. Who else? Who else? How much? 23? 23 to sir there. Twenty-four. I felt confident when I started. I thought, times will improve. And with the children's help. But… A man can cope with lots of setbacks. But there are lives about which you have to say… "Misfortunes never come singly." One thing I know for sure: we are old and worn out. And wretched. I understand it makes you sad, Van Paemel. But… I will make sure that Romanie gets a good position in the town. I don't want to distress my wife otherwise I'd throw her out in the street, too. Like I did with the others, God damn it! I cannot allow God's name to be taken in vain. Yes, you're right. I mustn't say that here. But if you're going from bad to worse like us… Oh, God. It's all too late. You've lost. That's normal for us. Van Paemel? You know that Mr. Maurice is getting married soon? And the wedding procession passes your door. You're not planning to kick up a rumpus? Or do something else? You needn't worry. As far as I'm concerned those people no longer exist. You have to be able to forgive and forget. Gee-up! Dees? Here, you can have my prize. Thank you. I think it's going to be a boy. Your stomach is quite pointed. With a girl it's more round. If it's a boy I'll call him Maurice. Eduard! -Eduard. -Zenobie. Romanie. You're showing already. Our whole street is waiting. I'm sure they are. To see the hero. -When is it due? -Another four months or so. I can work until the last week, madam says. Come on, Father. -What is madam like? -She's someone the priest knows. -You and your lover… -You and your fight… -I wish I could come to America. -America, we're going to America By boat We'll grab the Indians by the throat Right. Now you're fit to be seen again. Damn it, Cordulle. That's how they cut peasants' hair. -With a pudding basin. -I don't want to arrive with a gypsy. We just have to put our names down. If I can still write after so long. You're not going to disgrace me there. Understand? -That bastard is up there, too. -I thought she was younger. Masko, leave it alone. -I'm not hanging next to that scum. -What does it matter? I'm going to do something to that man. Behave! We've got enough misfortune. Come on. Inventor of hot water. You've been seen at the baron's again. -Me, constable? -Yes, you. Oh, yes. I was gathering rabbit food. You don't need a long stick for that. Do they shoot rabbits with sticks? What is the world coming to? You'll be locked behind bars before long. You can count on it. Here, constable, they're the poachers! And they don't shoot with sticks. And not only rabbits. Father? Eduard is here. He's leaving tomorrow. As far as I'm concerned he can leave whenever he wants. I won't be sad. Eduard! The baron has provided plenty of trees. -Hello, Eduard. -Hello, Mother. Hello, Father. Hello, Eduard. Is he getting married tomorrow? Yes. Zenobie couldn't come. The children are overexcited. Because they're going on a boat tomorrow. She still had to pack. Father? I'm leaving tomorrow. For America. Yes. I heard. Father, we haven't always seen things the same. I've often had terrible arguments with you. But now I'm leaving I've come to ask you to forgive me. We forgive you. -He doesn't need our forgiveness. -We forgive you. Everything I did I did because I thought it would help. Oh yes? Murdering and starting fires helps? You don't understand. All our life we worked for the children. And when we are old and poor and worn out, they leave us. Father, there's no future here. You can come to us. Kamiel and I will work for you. I'll look after myself. I'm used to it. Later I want to lie where my parents lie. Where's Dees? He's not very well. I heard you in the stable. We're leaving. Our family is getting smaller. Maybe that's a good thing. With the space we've got here. Here… For on the boat. About America. No, Dees. You can come out to us. America doesn't want people who are ill. I hope you'll do well. Like Kamiel. Say hello from me. -Maybe we'll meet again? -I hope so. I hope so. Mother, I'm leaving now. Goodbye, Mother. Take care. I hope it's not for ever. God protect you. Write to us as soon as you've arrived. And have seen Kamiel. Will do, Mother. Goodbye, Father. Eduard… I hope you'll be happy there. And say hello to Uncle Justin. And Kamiel? Don't I have to give Kamiel a message? Tell him I forgive him. And that I love you. Goodbye. Filomène? Filomène? Filomène? Filomène! Filo… Dees! Désiré! Filo… Filomène. Cordulle! Masko! Cordulle! Mother? Mother? -She's dying. -It'll pass. It'll pass. I'll get the doctor. I'll get the doctor! Don't die, Mother. Don't die. Don't let go. Don't let go. Don't die. Back. Come on. -Do something. Grab him. -He's going to kill us. Do something, damn you. Why, Dees? Sometimes you have to give luck a helping hand. Here, now you can have my prize. I don't need it anymore.
