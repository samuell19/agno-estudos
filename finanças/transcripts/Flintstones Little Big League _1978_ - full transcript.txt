[instrumental music] Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. [birds chirping] [humming] - Wilma! - What's the matter, Fred? You know, Wilma, some real brainy character invented a smart saying a long time ago. A man's home is his castle. Yes, I've heard that one, Your Majesty. Therefore, being the king of this castle do I or do I not have certain very private things which belong to me which I keep in certain very special places? And who took my bowling ball? Show him, Dino. [barking] (Wilma) 'I put it in a hat box.' (Fred) 'In a hat box?' [thud] Ooh, yow! Well, I've got to straighten things out once a year, at least. You know that old saying a sloppy king makes a messy castle. Uh, you're a riot, Wilma, a real riot! If Barney calls, tell him I'm on my way over. Oh, Fred, I don't think Barney can go bowling with you today. Are you kidding? We always go bowling on Saturday. - Well, Betty said-- - Not go bowling? Good old reliable, dependable Barney? [chuckles] - That's ridiculous. - 'But Betty said--' Yes, sir, I can always count on Barney to swing a few down on the old alley with me. I'll admit he's not the world's greatest but he's always in there, giving it the all color strike. - Boy, what a great loser! - But, Fred.. Women just don't understand what it means 'for a couple of buddies to get together' like this every Saturday. - It's tradition. - So is spring cleaning. Oh, no, you don't. A man deserves at least one day of relaxation at home. [laughs] I wish I had a day of relaxation at home. (Fred) 'Oh, that's greedy, Wilma.' You're home every day. You never leave the house. [gasps] Forgive me, sire. You're so right. Keep your eye in an old headpin get ready and yabba-dabba-doo! Fred, look out! [crash] For the furniture I put outside to paint. [barking] [slurping] What was that awful crash, mama? Your father, the king, leaving his castle. I think he missed the drawbridge. C-cut it out, Dino. Would you cut it? What? Uh, down, down, boy. Will-will you stop it? Wilma! [humming] Yow! Hey, Fred, Fred. You okay, pal? Oh-h, boy, you sure make a great baseball backstopper. [laughing] Baseball? You hit me with a baseball? Not me, it was Bamm-Bamm. Gee, sorry, Mr. Flintstone. You walked out just as I hit the ball. Yeah, well, I guess you just couldn't hold up a swing, Bamm-Bamm. Boy, that was some clout. [laughs] Hey, you know it, he's the big Bamm-Bamm-Bino. Star hitter for the Sandstone Sluggers. 'Batting 9.99.' 9.99? That's almost perfect. Hey, uh, why don't you go hit a few fly balls while I talk to Mr. Flintstone? Okay, pop. See you later, Mr. Flintstone. (Fred) 'Keep slugging in there, Bamm-Bamm.' Alright, Barn, get your ball and let's go bowling. Oh, sorry, Fred. No can do. What do you mean "no can do?" Well, I was hoping instead of bowling today you'd come out and root for us. What are you talking about? Root for what? Our baseball team. I'm the new coach. Somebody made you the coach of a baseball team? The Sandstone Sluggers. We're sponsored by the Gritand Gravel Greengrocers and, uh, we have a world seriesand everything. [chuckling] World series, that's ridiculous. No, it's not, Fred. Even Mayor Quartz's son is on our team. [yapping] That's even more ridiculous 'and you are the most ridiculous.' The mayor said I was doing a good thing for the community. 'He invited me and Betty over' for dinner tonight to talk it over. The mayor? Dinner? I still say it's ridiculous. Giving up a real man's game to go out and play with a bunch of kids. I don't want anything more to do with you. [barking] Hey, Fred, I can get you a season ticket right behind home plate. Aah! Gee. I wonder what he's so mad about? [whimpering] [barking] [whirring] [coughing] What a way to make a living. (Pebbles) 'Daddy, will you please move' so I can clean this part of the room? Daddy? - Who cares about baseball? - I think it's fun. And who wants to have dinner with the mayor? - Huh? - What's wrong, dear? Daddy's talking funny. Oh, for heaven's sake, Fred, stop moping just because Barney wouldn't go bowling with you. He's a dummy. Well, he is the coach of Bamm-Bamm's Little League team and I think that's wonderful. Oh, yeah? What does he know about the science of baseball? He can't even bowl two strikes in a row. Trying to coach baseball. Gee. I wish we could do something together like Bamm-Bamm is doing with his father. Yeah, sure, Pebbles, we'll do something together. Uh, what do you say we go bowling? - Bowling? - Yeah. Daddy, would you ask Mr. Rubble if I can be on his Little League team? I don't know Mr. Rubble anymore. Gee, mom, I don't understand. Is daddy sick or something? He's suffering from a terrible illness called rejection 'complicated by chronic and recurring attacks' 'of stabbing envy.' Poor daddy. Poor us, if we don't find a cure for it. I'm gonna go over and see Betty. Believe me, Betty he's a complete basket case. I can't believe it. Just because Barney is coaching the Little League team? Well, it's a new role for Fred. Now Barney is the important one. 'Every father wants Fred' 'to put in a good word for their son.' 'They know Fred and Barney are pals.' I never thought of that. I guess being a coach does give Barney's image quite a boost. Well, I think they'd be all friends again in a minute if Barney could just find a spot for Fred on his team. I'm sure he could. Now don't say I suggested it but could you ask Barney to see Fred? Oh, sure, Wilma. Oh, thanks, Betty. It's a really big favor. Forget it. What are friends for? 'That's what I ask Fred' and you should've heard the answer I got. [indistinct chatter] poof tok tok tok [whistles] Okay, men, this is just an intra-squad practice game but let's give it the old pepper. 'Play it like it was the world series.' - Sure, coach. - Right on. Okay, coach. (Barney) 'Uh, you're batting cleanup, Bamm-Bamm.' - Okay, pop. - 'You're leading off, Rocky.' - Yes, sir, coach. - Play ball. - Hi, Barney. - Betty. - What are you doing here? - Oh, nothing. I just came over to see how you were doing. Terrific. I got a championship team out there. 'We'll win the pennant for sure.' Barney, have you ever thought what a lucky man you are? You can say that again. I got a good job a nice home, and a sensational wife. Oh, Barney, that's sweet. (Barney) 'And it's also true.' Run out that hit, Bamm-Bamm. The Bamm-Bino did it again. He touched all four. Hey, hey, hey, I'm one lucky guy. Coach of a baseball team and got a son who's the all-time batting champ. And a good friend like Fred Flintstone. Uh, correction, Betty, you know we're not friends anymore. But if you've lost a friend you've lost one of your most valuable possessions. A friend? I go up to him and say, "Hi, Fred." And he says, "Hello, traitor." I say, "What's new, Freddy boy?" And he says, "Get lost, rat fink." Well, I'm lucky he don't hit me. 'Stretch it out, Shorty. Take second.' That's the old hustle. Maybe it could be just plain old jealousy. Fred, jealous of me? What for? Well, he doesn't coach the Sandstone Sluggers for one thing. Uh, you think he wants my Little League coaching job? I think he'd like working with you on the team. Hmm. Can't you make him some kind of assistant? Hey, I should have thought of that. It would be great having Fred with us. - What's wrong? - Uh, it's no use. Fred would never take a handout from me. Don't make it a handout. Be big, be generous. Tell him you want him and you need him. Hey, hit him in the old ego, huh? Right, you can do it, Barney. Uh, take over for me, Betty. I'll go see Fred right now. But Barney.. [whistles] Alright, men, into the first round. Change baskets and get ready to kick-off for the second half. (all) 'Huh?' screech [bells ringing] - Hiya, Wilma. - Hi, Barney. Oh, uh, Fred, look who's here. 'Your old friend Barney Rubble.' - 'Hiya, Fred.' - Hello, traitor. - Hey, what's new, Freddy boy? - Get lost, Rat Fink. I knew it. That's what I told Betty he'd say. Go speak to him, Barney. [instrumental music] Hey, good show you got on TV there. My favorite, yeah. That figures. Empty screens for empty heads. Oh, yeah? Well, you're looking at it. That's just so as I don't have to look at you. Now why don't you go out and play with the other kids? We want you in our team. I couldn't care less what you.. Huh? Did I hear you say you want me with the team? Your team? The Sandstone Sluggers? Hey, we not only want you, we need you. Well, you finally had to come to a real pro, huh? You found out muscle alone couldn't do it. You had to go for brains. [laughing] Yeah, that's right, Fred. And, uh, what position of great importance are you begging me to accept? - General manager? - No. There's only one job open and, uh-- I'll take it, I'll take it. 'And don't worry, pal, I'll take you all the way.' Build you a nice little championship team. Put you in the hall of fame. Now let's eat. Oh, good, they patched things up. - Uh, just one problem, Fred. - What's that, pal? I don't know if we have a uniform big enough for you. A uniform? You want me to play, too? Uh, uh, gee, no, Fred. Only the kids can play. We want you for assistant bat boy. Out, out, out! You rat fink. I-if you change your mind, call me. thud [instrumental music] Hey, Fred, boss wants to see you in his office. Mr. Slate wants to see me? 'He said get in there on the double.' Probably wants to congratulate me on the superior job I'm doing. I don't know, Fred. He sounded mad to me. - Mad, huh? - Relax, Fred. They gotta give you two weeks notice and you always said you're too big for this puny job, anyway. Yeah, right. [laughs] (Slate) 'Bedrock Quarry, Slate speaking.' 'Oh, hello, Charlie.' [knocking on door] 'Come in.' Please, sir, I know I've been in a little slip lately but I lost my best friend and-- Flintstone, I'm on the phone. No, sorry, sir. I'll come back next month sometime. Sit down! Okay, Charlie, send him over and we'll try him out. Good, good, the younger, the better. Younger? Oh, boy. (Slate) 'So long, Charlie.' Look, Mr. Slate, I think young, I feel young. It's just this extra weight makes me look older. [chuckles] Don't worry, the kids will run that extra lard off you in a hurry. Huh? Kids? What kids? I hear you'd been out telling the boys in the quarry how you are a real expert on baseball. Well, you know how it is, Mr. Slate. I did a little talking, but it was all in my lunch break. Well, you're just the man I was looking forward to be my coach. How's that? I'm getting into the Little League. Great public relations, gonna sponsor a team. Calling 'em the Bedrock Brontos. You think you can handle it? Wow, can I handle it? But on the phone just now, you just told Charlie to send over a younger man. Charlie? Oh, you mean Judge Shale. Judge Shale? Yeah, he wanted to make sure his little boy will play on the team. Well, Flintstone, can you give us a winning team? Yes, sir, I'll take you all the way, Mr. Slate. Build you a world champion. We'll sweep the series and oh, boy wait till Barney Rubble gets a load of this. Yabba-dabba-doo! whoosh ♪ Take me out to the ballgame ♪ ♪ Watch me take Rubble apart ♪ [police siren wailing] screech Ah, oh, hello, officer. I was just hurrying home from work with terrific news. And I have some terrific news for you. - Yeah? - Yeah. I'm not gonna slap the cuffs on you and run you in. Well, gee, thanks. I'm gonna give you a teeny-weeny speeding citation instead. Oh. Now let's see your driver's license. '"Fred Flintstone."' That's Coach Fred Flintstone, officer. I've just been put in charge of the Bedrock Brontos, Little League team. Well, that is good news. Yes, sir, I'm gonna build a championship club. We're as good as got the pennant in the bag. Well, I'm gonna let you go this time. Just a friendly little warning to slow down. Well, thanks, officer. 'And have I got a pitcher for you.' - Huh? Who? - My son, Lefty Loam. Why, he's a natural southpaw. [honking] His sinker just drops right out of sight. He'd win 20 games for you, easy. Yeah, well, um, have him report to the field this Saturday, officer. I'll tell him, coach, that will be a real privilege giving you a police escort the rest of the way home. Gee, thanks, officer. [police siren wailing] Wow, wait till Wilma hears about this. (Fred) 'Sports Department, this is Fred Flintstone' 'newly appointed coach of the Bedrock Brontos.' The Bedrock Brontos. Brontos like in brontosaurus. No, I'm not training an animal act, it's kids. Hello? Yeah, hello? We got cut off. Oh, well, they'll be calling me back. I'm gonna be one busy man from now on, Wilma. Interviews, dinner speeches, TV appearances. Fred, you didn't invent the wheel or discover fire, you know. I wouldn't expect a women to understand the importance of a big managerial position in the sports world. (Wilma) 'Now it's important.' You thought it was idiotic when Barney took the same job. It is not the same job, Wilma. I was picked to head up a super team. 'The Bedrock Brontos." I will wipe Barney's club off the map. Bury him in the bottom of the standings. [telephone rings] It's for me, Fred. crash Hello, Sports Department. I thought you'd be calling back. Uh, oh! 'Yeah, hi, Betty, you wanna talk to Wilma, huh?' Well, you tell Barney it won't work. He can't fool an all-pro like me. Fred, what was that all about? And why did you hang up on Betty? Don't you get it, Wilma? Barney has Betty spying for his team. Trying to find out things about my team. But Betty wanted to talk to me. I know, it's a cheap low way to get at a man through his wife. Daddy, what position do I get to play in the team? Honey, you wanna play baseball? I sure do, especially when my daddy is the coach. Now look, little girl, it's this way. Well, baseball is a man's game, see? Why is it a man's game? Yeah, Fred, answer that one. I thought I'd get to do something with you like Bamm-Bamm does with his father. Oh, you bet you can do something with me. You can come out to the ballpark and give us a lot of cheering. 'Talk it up, keep it real lively for the team.' - Yeah, team. - 'That's the idea.' We better get out to the field. The players will be waiting. Yay, team. Yay, team. Yay, team. Oh, poor Pebbles. (Barney) 'Okay, fellas, let's have a little practice.' 'Go, go, go.' That's the old corner, Rocky boy. Nice tag. 'Get under that one, Peewee.' Nice catch, Peewee. Hey, look, Mr. Rubble. Huh? [hammering] There, that ought to keep spies from peeking in on us. (Barney) 'Hi, Fred. Hi, Pebbles.' Hi, Mr. Rubble, we're just-- Watch the loose talk, Pebbles. You might give away secrets. But I don't know any secrets. Hey, that's a great windbreaker you're putting up for us. It is not a windbreaker. Boy, I'm sure glad you decided to come out and join us. I did not come to join you. I kept that assistant bat-boy job open for you. - And, uh-- - Rubble, shut up! That ain't very respectful to the coach, Fred. Don't you ever hear the news? Don't you know what's going on in the world? What's going on, Fred? Well, it just so happens that I have my own team. The Bedrock Brontos of which I am manager and coach. Hey, that's great, Fred. Gonna give us a little friendly competion, huh? If you call complete annihilation friendly competion. You must have some great ball club. - Uh, mind if I take a look? - Oh, no, you don't. That's why I put up the screen. You'll get your first look at them on opening day as you go down to defeat. Okay, Fred, may the best team win. And don't let me catch you spying. When do we start practicing, dad? (Fred) 'Right now, sweetheart.' Now you get up in the stands, and give us some big cheers. 'You know, boost the old morale.' Sure, dad. Yay, team. Yay, team. [whistles] Alright, Brontos, line up. Oh, boy. [clears throat] I am your coach, gentlemen. My name is Fred Flintstone. Now do you have any questions? Anything you want an answer to? I got a question, Flintstone. I am Mr. Flintstone or coach or sir. Yes, sir, I'd like to know what you're thinking on an O and two situation? Do you say put the next one over or waste a couple? Uh, yeah, well, uh 'well, my thinking is it's, uh' 'it's too much for you to handle yet, Peewee.' [barking] Oh, hi, Dino. My name ain't Peewee, it's Lefty Loam. And my dad said I'm gonna be your star southpaw pitcher. Oh, you are the son of the traffic cop. - Uh-huh. - Yes, sir. Ha, ha, ha. There's no hit pitching written all over you big fella, yes, siree. [laughs] Oh, boy. I'm glad you came, Dino. You can help me cheer the team. You know, "Yay, team. Yay, team." Are you awake, kid? Huh? We gotta have sharp minds and bodies on this team. So stay alert or go join Barney's club next door. [yawns] Right on, coach. I didn't wanna get out of bed today. But my old man, like, wow he really read the law to me, you know. Just because he's a judge, big deal. Judge? Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute, kid. I didn't know you were Judge Shale's boy. Yeah. Now you get a good sleep out in right field. [laughs] How many balls come out that way, right? Right. Goodnight, coach. But if you don't mind I'll curl up right here, okay? Boy, I got only one chance. 'Maybe there's some hidden talent there.' Now listen, fellas. This is an automatic pitching machine. tok (Barney) 'There she goes!' 'Nice hit, Bamm-Bamm.' Oh, boy, that Bamm-Bamm is dyno-mite. Well, like I was saying, this machine will pitch the ball. Okay, batter up. 'No, no, no, no, no. You're crowding the plate.' Now stand back and give the pitcher his zone. 'Boy, if you ever get all that beef' 'behind a hit, it's gone.' 'Play ball!' Did I hit it? Oh, boy. Yay, team. Yay, team. Okay, I'll admit the batting's can improve but let's show some sharp fielding. Now get set for the old double plays. Zing-zing, sixty four to three. boing boing boing [thud] boing boing boing Nice, fellas, real nice. 'A great triple play.' Well, we need work on the hitting and the fielding but we know we got the pitching with Lefty in there. Come on, Lefty, show us some of your stuff. 'Nice form, Lefty.' Now give us the old sinker ball. Yay, team. Yay, team. [instrumental music] (Barney) 'Low bridge, Fred.' Hey, Fred, the Bamm-Bambino did it again. Another four-bagger. Oh, yeah? Well, all you got is a one-man team. We got balance in our club. Everybody's lousy. (Slate) 'Okay, you had a couple of sessions, Flintstone.' Who's the hot pitcher? Who's our best slugger? Tell me all about our all-star club. Well, sir, so far I've had to bench over half our players. - What? - Yeah, don't worry though. - We'll get organized. - You better. And give me a winner. I want a champion. My company's name is on the back of those shirts. - I don't want any second place. - Yes, sir. If you want your job, deliver. Look, Mr. Slate, probably a lot of other men could do a better coaching job. I don't mean the coaching job. I mean your job here at the quarry. Oh, no. How am I gonna produce a winning team with that bunch? Maybe if I move Fatso over the short stuff. He can't catch a ball 'but nothing's gonna get past him.' screech [thud] Yeah, hi, there, officer. Nice running into you again. I mean, uh-- Well, if it isn't Mr. Flintstone. Yeah! Uh, sure glad you remembered. (male #1) 'How could I forget?' I let you off the hook on that speeding violation and now you're going in for a vicious rear-ending. 'Your driver's license, please.' I guess you forgot. I'm coach of the Bedrock Brontos. Oh, I remember very well. Now we'll just run down to the courthouse and after Judge Shale revokes your license-- Judge Shale? His kid is on my team. Well, the judge will wanna chat a lot of baseball with you. Technical questions, you know like why you benched his son. vroom I had to. He's not a natural like your boy. Now there's a fine pitcher. Then why is he also sitting on the bench? Uh, well, uh, that's, uh.. Well, well, that's just temporary. The old pitching rotation, you know? [laughs] He'll be right back in there. - When? - Uh, when? Well, I, I just thought it over. Your boy, Lefty, pitches the opening game and every other game after that. screech Oh, I can't do it not to an outstanding citizen who's doing such fine work with juveniles. Here's your license. Gee, thanks. Thanks a lot, officer. Now I'll just give you a second friendly warning and let's hope there's never a third. Uh, uh, no, sir. [laughs] (Shale) 'Jail is much too good for you, Flagstone.' (Fred) 'It's, uh, Flintstone, judge--' What kind of a man are you breaking the heart of a simple young lad like Dusty who only wants to play baseball? But Judge Shale, Your Honor, he is-- How can you look at a child eager to belong ready to contribute his all? 'How can you look at him and tell him he isn't wanted?' Go sit on the bench, you said. [shrieks] 'Oh, I'll get you in my court one day.' - 'Cobblestone.' - Flintstone. And I'll throw the book at you. I'll put you away for life. Justice will always triumph. Dusty seemed kind of tired. I only put him on the bench to rest up, Your Honor. When do you intend to put him back in the lineup? Oh, one of these days he'll be back out there in right field racing around with his old zipping-- - Answer the question. - Tomorrow. Good, I may have judged you on flimsy and insufficient evidence, Slipstone. - Flintstone. - Case dismissed. You will all rise when the judge leaves. That does it. The team's through and I'm through. Oh, Fred, Little League is supposed to be 'a lot of fun and laughs.' Well, here's a couple of laughs for you. The boss says either come up with a winning team or I'm fired 'and I got fathers forcing me to make first stringers' out of kids that can't even play dominoes. Is one little boy so much better than another? Betty says Barney's team is coming along fine. Barney's just lucky. He's got Bamm-Bamm, a one-man team. Bamm-Bamm is a natural-born athlete. Daddy, maybe I'm a natural-born athlete. [laughs] (Fred) 'You're a natural-born girl, honey.' You're meant to do different things than swinging a bat or running bases. I know. Yay, team. [indistinct chatter] Okay, Bamm-Bamm, do your stuff. Right on, pop. (Barney) Another four-bagger. Oh, good batting, Bamm-Bamm! Alright, Dusty, let's see you hit one. Sure, coach. It's your turn, Dino. [yapping] Alright, let's see what you can do, Flakey. Okay, Fatso, let's see you lose one. tok Ya hit it! Ya hit it! Gee. It was only a foul ball, coach. I know, but you soared. You got a piece of it. We're on our way. Okay, Pebbles, toss the ball down. Gee, dad. Didn't you see me make that catch? (Fred) 'That's right, honey. It was pretty lucky.' Now, let me have the ball. You're holding up the game. Anything you say, dad. whoosh Come on, Pebbles, stop fooling around and throw that ball! I just did and you missed it. Here, coach. Here's the ball Pebbles just threw. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thanks, uh, Lefty. Um, uh, Pebbles, will you will you come down here a minute? Here, I want you to throw me a few. Pitch me one, just like you did before. - Okay, coach. You ready? - Ready. Alright, let me see you put it one right in the old pocket. 'Okay.' Okay, okay. You got some great moves now. Let's see your pitch. - It's in your mitt. - Huh? [laughs] I-I guess I was looking away for a minute. Try another one. I'll give you my screwball, sinker slider, change of pace, without a windup. [whooshing] screech Out of the blue! The greatest! A nighty game winner. We're in! Now can I play, daddy? You got a lifetime contract natural-born athlete. Oh, thank you, daddy. Thank you. [yapping] [slurping] [laughs] Oh, cut it out, Dino. [instrumental music] Hup-hup, hup-hup, hup-hup, hup-hup 'hup-hup, hup-hup, hup.' Oh, where are you going, Fred? It's only five o'clock in the morning. (Fred) 'We're gonna do a little roadwork, Wilma.' Hup-hup, hup-hup, hup-hup, hup-hup, hup-hup.. There's Mr. Rubble and Bamm-Bamm. Hi, Bamm-Bamm. Shh. Never get friendly with the other side. They'll try to pump you and learn your secrets. Look, it's Mr. Flintstone and Pebbles. Hi, Pebbles. Hey, w-watch it, Bamm-Bino. 'Loose talk like that can lose the ball game.' [mumbles] (Fred) 'Time to run through our signals again, ace.' 'Secret signals from the catcher' 'tell you what pitch to give a batter.' - Yes, I know, dad. - 'Okay.' And when I double up my fist, what's that? (Pebbles) 'Fast ball, bow.' Good. Now, this one. Thumbs down. - 'Slide in.' - 'Great.' Hello? Oh, hi, Betty. Oh, just reading the paper. I was hoping you.. Fred, what in the world? That was Betty! I know it was Betty, I don't want you talking to her, giving away secrets. What secrets? She was going to give me a cake recipe. Barney, something's wrong. This time Wilma hung up on me. I'm going over and seeing what's wrong. Uh, h-hold it, Betty. That's the camp of the enemy. Barney, Wilma is my best friend. That's what you think. 'She's a spy for the Bedrock Brontos.' Fred, it's still broad daylight. Why did you pull the shade down? He's out there, Wilma, spying trying to get our secret signals. 'I can feel him.' Oh! Pebbles, this is too much. I'm going over to see Betty. Where's that costume you wore last Halloween? [knocking on door] Coming. [laughs] I'm your beauty lady. Got some new beauty aids. Is the lady of the house home? Um, yeah, sure. - Uh, hey, Betty! - 'Coming.' Uh, out of curiosity how'd they ever pick you to sell beauty aids? How do you think I keep my looks? - I use them. - Who's that, Barney? You won't believe this, but it's the beauty lady. I, uh, wouldn't buy anything from her, Betty. She uses it and she looks 90 years old. [laughs] Shows you how good this stuff is. I'm a 104. - It's me, Betty. - Wilma! [laughs] I had to get to see you somehow. I wanted you to know I didn't hang up on you but Fred would scream if he saw us talking. Barney is acting the same way. Fred's supposed to be showing kids how to have fun but he's just eating and breathing and living baseball every minute. - 'It's an obsession.' - Barney too. Each one thinks his team is gonna beat the other. Do you realize what that means, Betty? For months after that one of us will have to live with the loser. Oh, no. [sighing] [indistinct chatter] Okay. Keep tossing those warm-up pitches, Pebbles. The rest of you take batting practice. Only one day left to get in winning shape. Ah-ha, I knew it, trying to spy on us. Of all the low, miserable, cheap bushly tricks. Good thing I was here or you would have spied on us. I don't have to spy. I've got a pitcher nobody can hit. And I got a slugger nobody can pitch to. Oh, Barney, this is ridiculous. We're acting like a couple of kids. Yeah, you're right, Fred, we ought to act like a couple of grown men. - 'I got an idea, Barn.' - 'Yeah? What?' We'll stick together every minute right up to the big game tomorrow. [chuckles] That's a very good idea, Fred. I don't wanna let you out of my sight, neither. [laughs] (Fred) 'We'll divide the time equally between our homes.' 'Eat at your place, sleep at mine.' Well, gee, Fred, that's, uh, not very equal. I'm a light sleeper and you're a very heavy eater. - Is it a deal? - It's a deal. (Fred) 'Barney, it's two o'clock in the morning.' 'We've been lying here five hours.' 'Don't you ever go to sleep?' Oh, yeah. Oh, boy. Uh, I'm getting real sleepy. [yawns] Well, goodnight, Fred. Goodnight. Hey, Fred, how about a little snack? We snacked it up two hours ago. Now go to sleep! Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, uh, goodnight, Fred. - 'Goodnight.' - Hey, Fred. You wanna play a little pinochle? Goodnight, Barney. Goodnight, Fred. (Wilma) 'Well, this is it.' 'All ready for the big opening game, boys?' Yeah, Wilma, all set. You better get started for the ballpark. Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm left an hour ago 'and I'm driving there with Betty.' 'Oh, that's gonna be' 'a great ball game.' A ball game? Gee, I hope we're not late for the game. Uh, can't you go a little faster, Fred? [snoring] Hey, hey, Fred. Fred, wake up. Huh? What? What's the matter? We gotta get to the ballpark. Step on it. vroom [police siren wailing] Uh-oh. We got a smoky at the back door. Don't worry. I know this cop. I can handle him. screech Hello there, officer. I guess you must be as anxious to get the game started as we are. Huh, I guess you're new on this route. Paperboys have routes milkmen have routes police officers do not have routes. Sorry, officer. I guess you wanna see my driver's license. You guessed wrong again. You're gonna show it to Judge Shale. He'll wanna see it when he revokes it. W-wait, officer. You can't take him in. He'll miss the big game. I'm taking both of you in. B-b-but I'm just a passenger. Uh-uh, just an innocent pigeon uh, what you might call a-a passenger pigeon. Come on, both of you. vroom [indistinct chattering] Where are those coaches? The game's about to start. Hi, mom. Hi, Mrs. Flintstone. (Betty) 'Hi, son!' I see Bamm-Bamm. Where's Pebbles? Oh, she sat there in, uh, what they call the cow yard. I think it's called the bullpen. Oh, well. 'She's throwing the ball and cooling down.' - 'Warming up.' - 'Whatever.' I wonder what's keeping Fred and Barney. - 'Court will now adjourn.' - 'Two more cases, Your Honor.' Two more? This is a great time to start a crime wave. Just when we've got a big ball game going. - 'Thirty days. No probation.' - Oh. What are these men doing here? Thirty days. You just gave them each thirty days. That's ridiculous. What did they do? We were just hurrying to get to the ballpark, Your Honor. (Judge Shale) 'Of course, you were.' Couldn't you see they were hurrying to get to the ballpark? Sentence suspended. Court is now adjourned. Officer, get us to the ballpark sirens going full blast. Come on, fellers. (all) Play ball! Play ball! Play ball! Play ball! 'Play ball! Play ball!' Where are those two husbands of yours? I've got no idea, Mr. Slate. We've got to start the game. This is bad for my corporate image. But you can't play without coaches. You two are the coaches. Take over for your husbands. That crowd is getting ugly. But Mr. Slate.. Oh, dear. What does a coach do, Wilma? Well, I think they yell at the umpire and, and argue all the time. Well, the kids know the game. We'll just let 'em play. Play ball! [audience cheering] Alright, team, let's everybody get a hit! The other side is up first, mom. Oh. Gee, mom. You're gonna coach? Right, Bamm-Bamm. You wanna go first? I'm batting clean-up, mom. Well, you'll get dirty sooner or later. So go on out there. [indistinct chattering] (Slate) 'Strike one!' 'Strike two and three!' 'You're out!' [honking] Gosh, we've been stuck here two hours already. We'll never be able to play. Move it, move it. Do something, officer. [indistinct chattering] Strike one! Boo! Boo! You're blind as a bat! Get some new glasses. What are you arguing about? That's your pitcher out there. You're just prejudiced because she's a girl. vroom screech Hey, the game's already started. How can they start without the coaches? Strike three! You're out! Atta-girl, Pebbles! Hit them low and fast! Look, Barn, Wilma's coaching the Bedrock Brontos. And Betty is coaching the Sandstone Sluggers. - We gotta stop the game. - Oh, no, you don't. The game's already under extra innings and it's a scoreless tie. 'The women must be doing okay.' Maybe the judge is right, huh, Fred? Well, yeah. [crowd cheering] That's the old eye, Dusty. Make 'em put it over! [instrumental music] tok Whoopie! It's a hit, it's a hit! That was a hit, wasn't it? I got it, I got it! I got it, I got it! [thud] You're out! [pecking] [instrumental music] (male #2) 'Come on, hit one, Bamm-Bamm!' [crowd cheering] 'Run, Bamm-Bamm, run!' screech It was a home run, wasn't it? Oh, I don't know what to call it. How can it be a home run? It didn't go out of the ballpark. - It went straight up. - It can't be a foul. Well, nobody caught it. So I'm not out. Nobody caught it because it never came down. What do you say, Pebbles? Let's call it a tie. Okay, what do you say, gang? [all cheering] Altogether, gang. One, two, three, four!
