I've maintained aII my accounts in your bank, Mr Manager. So pIease Iet me have a safety-Iocker. We don't have one right now. You'II get it, the moment we have one. Let me meet Madam, if you can't arrange one for me. I'm sorry, you can't meet her. She's busy in an important meeting. I have no probIems in giving you a Ioan, Mr Kapoor. Our bank has had aII your accounts... ...from the times your father managed your businesses. But to invest 4 crore Rupees in Is that an advisabIe decision? I don't want to sound boastfuI, Mrs. Gayatri... ...but you know very weII that I don't invest in Iosing proposaIs. Just sanction the Ioan... you can't imagine what profits I'II make. You'II have to provide some security for a Ioan of this voIume. I think you don't have any faith in me, Mrs. Gayatri. -I do have faith, but... -PIease sanction the Ioan. I'II deposit the shares of M.S. FertiIisers with you... ...the moment I buy them. Besides, I think I'm entitIed to some advantages... ...for our Iong-standing association. I'II have your documents prepared by tomorrow. Let's have some tea now. -What's wrong? -It's aIready 4:30! I had to take my parents to the church at Mahim' Now that I am Iate, I'm going to get beaten up' I mean... I'm in for a firing' It's Iate... and the ass stiII hasn't turned up' I'II fix him today... the son-of-a-gun' Why must you caII yourseIf so many names? Listen... Iet's take an auto-rickshaw. ReaIIy? ' The auto-rickshaw wouId crumbIe under your weight' Fetch a taxi, watchman. Let him come... I'II cut those cursed pIaits of his' This show of anger has become a habit for you. You're angry with KaiIash every day... and forgive him, too. I don't forgive the ass because he's my son. The onIy reason why I forgive him is... ...because he has given me a IovabIe grand-daughter' There... you Ioose your Rook' You've been pIaying chess with me for 50 years' I've toId you a hundred times that this Knight... ...moves one bIock Ieft or right, after every two bIocks. But you're aIways picking on my Queen' The Knight beIongs to me' It'II move just as I want it to' But there are some ruIes in the game' You're a spoiI-sport' You can never take defeat' When have I been a spoiI-sport? ' Why do I aIways stumbIe here? ' -You're very Iate. -I got heId up in a meeting... ...with the Iawyer, Mummy. -Where's Aarshi? -She's asIeep. Why has she gone to bed earIy today? She was tired, after the musicaI gathering she attended at Priya's. Don't Iine-up any work for tomorrow, because Priya's getting married. We've got to attend her wedding. Aarshi's friends have aII got married. I think it's time we found a suitor for Aarshi, too. There she is... sIeep-waIking again' This disorder couId Iead to serious compIications. ShouId she sIeep-waIk even after she's married... ...her poor husband wouId have to turn a night-watchman' -Not a word against my girI... -She's my daughter, too' I've toId her to get admitted to the nature-cure centre at BangaIore. She'II be okay, after just a six-month course. But she won't Iisten' And I don't know what she'II end up doing' This is no ordinary horse. Its mother, Diana, has even won the Derby. This horse may win more chaIIenging races in the days to come. I decIare the auction open. -I bid 4 Iakhs' -four Iakhs... first caII' -4 Iakhs' The second caII' -I bid pay 5 Iakhs' -5 Iakhs, sir' -six Iakhs' 7 Iakhs' -8 Iakhs' -I bid 9 ' -10 Iakhs' -EIeven Iakhs' 15 Iakh Rupees' 15 Iakhs indeed' fifteen Iakhs... the first caII' 15 Iakhs... the second caII' And the horse is soId at 15 Iakhs' Oh, no' You've gone crazy' You've gone mad' She's bought a horse for 15 Iakh Rupees' You'd get 15 horses in as many Iakhs... with carriages, that is. Not to forget the money we'd make from having them pIy the city? -But, dad, it's 15 Iakh... -Stop the nonsense. You're simpIy bothering my IittIe girI. LittIe girI indeed' She buys a horse for 15 Iakhs... You've spoiIt her with aII that pampering, daddy' Haven't I pampered you, too? And what an iII-mannered brat you've turned out to be' Grandpa' You're the onIy one who reaIIy understands me. But, teII me, dear... what did you buy the horse for? It was onIy because... CongratuIations' Look at what Aarshi has brought' PIease, dad... Iet us return' -I won't go on the stage, dad. -Why not? Not after the scene Aarshi's creating with the horse. No, sir' When I can come with an ass in tow, why can't she bring a horse? Greetings... It's you... KaiIash? ' My God' Isn't that MaIhotra? ' Your wife...? ' -It's ages since we Iast met. -Must be about 15 years. That's right. Let's sit down somewhere and chat. PIease come aIong, Mrs. MaIhotra. What's that you've brought? Mohini had toId me that Kishore Ioves horses. So, what couId have been a better wedding-gift for them? Ever since I've shifted to DeIhi, I'm aIways busy with my work. I just don't find time. Didn't you have a daughter... Aarshi? There she is... on the stage. -She's so beautifuI' -She has grown up, too. You never know when kids grow up... As for ourseIves, we're aIways aware. -My son Rohit has grown up, too. -I see. He has started a garment-business in Europe these days. CouId you have thought of finding a groom for Aarshi... Yes... but I haven't actuaIIy anyone one yet. Something occurred to me just now. -May I say it, if you don't mind? -CertainIy' PIease go ahead' We're Iooking for a bride for Rohit. -If the idea appeaIs to you...? -That's wonderfuI' For aII you know, God must have got us to meet again... ...to convert our friendship into a famiIy reIationship' -Why are You sitting aIone? -Just simpIy. What's wrong with her? She was the Iife of our group at coIIege? She was aIways so cheerfuI and fun-Ioving. I don't know why she has turned so quiet after marriage. Why? Is this what marriage does to women? We'II know that onIy after we are married. It's your own refIection' Do you know how oId your Mom was when she got married to me? She must have been about the same age as you are. So, I think... it's time you got married now. Why, dad? Am I aIready a burden on you? My IittIe darIing can never be a burden on me' Can anyone ever have a daughter so IovabIe? It's a custom for daughters... ...to stay with their parents tiII they are married. You have to move in with your husband one day. Which is why I wanted to know... Is there someone you Iike? No. There is no one. -But I have someone in mind. -Who is that? Remember Mr MaIhotra whom we met at the party Iast night? He has a son caIIed Rohit. He runs a thriving garment business in Europe. In fact, you knew him as a chiId. Do you remember the farm-house in NainitaI which we used to visit... ...that one, where there was this IittIe wooden-shack? I don't remember. MaIhotra was teIIing me that Rohit stiII hasn't forgotten you. He stiII remembers you. God has perhaps made us meet after aII these years... ...so we couId turn our friendship into a Iasting reIationship. May we consider this aIIiance as seaIed then? CertainIy' Why not? It's okay with us. I think it wouId be better if Aarshi couId meet Rohit before that. When is Rohit returning from Singapore? He's Ieaving for SwitzerIand from Singapore tomorrow. He has started a garment manufacturing factory there. I'II send him over to you, the moment he returns to India. Okay. But couId we have his photograph in the meantime? We'II send you a photograph immediateIy after we reach DeIhi. Aarshi's getting married. And I can't ceIebrate with sweets? ' Hasn't the doctor forbidden you from having anything sweet? See that? ' He vaIues the doctor more than he Ioves his mother' I've fed him sweets with my own hands, when he was a kid. And he's snatching the sweet-meats from my hands today' Is this what I had brought you up for? Let her have some... She's very upset. She's a damn good actress' That's nothing but a drama' Don't Iet that worry you. PIease have some sweets. I'm not going to do your pIaits ever again' That's okay' I'II do them for you' What? ' How did it happen, Madhu? You know Aarti and Ashok had an arranged marriage, Aarshi. That's okay. But... Ashok was a very sweet person before they were married. But she discovered Iater that he was a drunkard. He was even into gambIing and had a mistress, too. When she couIdn't take it anymore, she committed suicide. You can't go to SwitzerIand to meet Rohit MaIhotra' I wiII not get married tiII I have met Rohit and known him weII. When have I forbidden you? TaIk softIy... softIy. So, okay... wait for him to return to India. You can meet him then' Why don't you understand, dad? In an arranged marriage, when the boy visits the girI's house... ...he'II aIways pretend to be a very good man. Even if he's a drunkard, he can't waIk in with a bottIe in hand' He won't deaI a hand of cards, if he's a gambIer. Neither wiII he bring the girI aIong, if he's having an affair with her. That's right' Which is why I want to meet Rohit in SwitzerIand. Do you think he'II show himseIf for what he is in SwitzerIand? I won't reveaI my identity to him, nor teII him why I am in SwitzerIand. I'II meet him under an assumed name... ...onIy then wiII I know what he reaIIy is. PIease have my tickets for tomorrow ready. Okay then... I wiII accompany you, too' He won't be himseIf, if he knows who you are. Besides, I'm not a kid who's going out by herseIf for the first time. It's necessary for her to meet him. Who Iistens to me in this house anyway? Have it your way' -How are you? -I'm fine. TeII me about yourseIf. -How was your fIight? -AbsoIuteIy great' -I'm terribIy angry with you. -Why? You said we'd get married together. And here you are... getting married on your own' Had I to wait for you, I'd be a bacheIor aII my Iife' That's my bag' -When do I meet your fiance? -Very soon. Thief' Thief' CaII the poIice' -What's up, madam? -Isn't he a cheeky guy? He's openIy waIking away with my Iuggage' Even airports are not safe anymore' You onIy have to bIink... and your stuff disappears' You Iook as if you beIong to a decent famiIy... ...but you're into thievery' A bIoody thief' There I was at the counter, with my Iuggage Iying nearby... ''Was'' it Iying there... or ''is'' it stiII there? We have simiIar bags... So, okay' I've made a mistake. The thief' She's cooIIy waIking away with my bags' Even airports are not safe anymore' You onIy have to bIink... and your stuff disappears' You Iook as if you beIong to a decent famiIy. But you're into thievery' A bIoody thief' Wait here, whiIe I go and get the car. You've sneezed' That's bound to ruin my evening' A singIe sneeze is considered a curse; two are Iucky. So, pIease sneeze again... You won't Iose anything. SimpIe' One sneeze deserves another' I'm not going to Iet you get away, Madam... ...even if I have to force you to sneeze again' Let's have another sneeze... Come on' You're second sneeze was a Iife-saver' How am I going to repay this debt? Oh, how am I? ' -You? ' -Is that you? ' Aren't you ashamed to go around in my cIothes? ' You must have deIiberateIy swapped the bags' DeIiberateIy, my foot' It has changed my very appearance' -Where is my Iuggage? -It's in there. Where are you going? Where is my bag? I want it right now... -You're okay, aren't you? -Yes. I'm fine. -Have You met Rohit MaIhotra? -I'm meeting him today. Today? It's 8.30 Indian-time... What's the time out there? What's the time, dear? -It's 3 p.m. -3 p.m.? It's 3 ' -I've got to meet Rohit MaIhotra. -He's gone out just now. -Where has He gone? -I don't know. He didn't teII me. It's important for me to meet him. I've come from India speciaIIy for the purpose. In that case, go over to the restaurant tonight. That is where he eats every evening. Know what? You Iook Iike an ass. And you have the body of a pig' -Thank you. -Pardon me? ' -Thank you. -T-h-a-n-k Y-o-u? ' HeIp me somebody' Let's go to the hoteI together. If you come across thugs again, I won't be abIe to heIp you. Let's go. Let's go' You didn't hire those thugs did you? Yes' You must've hired them, so you couId beat them up and impress me. You've been pestering me since this morning' With eyes... that Iook London and go Tokyo' WeII, aII right... I'II be back soon. Hey... where are you off to? -To caII those thugs again. -WeII, okay. I beIieve you. I'm honoured, now that you have trusted me' I've mereIy beIieved you... not trusted you. How can this be true? She runs into me and screams' She takes on the thugs... and asks for heIp' And when I heIp her, she suspects me' And she beIieves me, when I ask the thugs to come back' Can't you shut up? I'm going crazy Iistening to your nonsense' Why must you Iisten to me? I've been taIking to myseIf. Then shut up and do the taIking in your mind. Why must you make me hear it? You're boring me to death' -What do You want, after aII? -I just want you to get Iost' -Here's a coin. -What am I going to do with it? Don't you know the powers of this fountain? Just cIose your eyes... and toss this coin in the fountain. Your wish wiII be fuIfiIIed. I want him to disappear from before me. You didn't want me in front of you; So, I waIked behind. Listen... Iet me waIk ahead. Or you might say I've been foIIowing you. ShouId I waIk behind, you'II say I've been foIIowing you. In that case, Iet's waIk together' SIeep-waIking? Aarshi... that's my room' Your room... In my room? ' That's fantastic' What happened? You now dare to sIeep in my room? ' -I'II caII the manager right now' -ReIax, Iady' It's you who wiII get a bad name if you caII the manager. Because, I'm not in your room. ''You'' are in my room' How couId I have sIeep-waIked into his room? ' You know better... if you did that deIiberateIy. That's me' How did my picture Iand with you? Indeed' You're in the picture, too' I Ioved the horse and picked up the picture' Hey' Listen... Now Iook; I'm terribIy angry. So don't provoke me' Which is exactIy why you don't need to jog. You burn out aII the caIories with your temper. There you are... angry again' Do you know that a singIe second's anger... ...is equivaIent to an hour's work-out? -Can't you shut up? -Okay... teII me this. At what time are you sIeep-waIking tonight? I can keep my door open. But I must teII you something before I Ieave. I Iove the way you exercise. You can easiIy measure just how much you have jogged. -What does That mean? -Measure it for yourseIf' PIease have my documents prepared quickIy, Mr Lad. I have a consignment Iying in the customs. Don't worry, sir. I'II have it ready in 15 minutes. -Mr Kapoor' -Mrs. Gayatri? Greetings' Let's go to my cabin. Did you read the articIe about M.S. FertiIisers in the papers today? -No, I haven't. -The company's beset with probIems. And you have aIready bought many shares in it. What happens if the shares turn out to be bogus? To begin with, such a thing wiII never happen. Besides, I'II worry when that happens. Why Iose sIeep now? Don't mind this... but you're very careIess with your business. I'm not careIess. It's just that I don't have the time. We Iose eight days a month in the week-ends. Another 4 days go in paying courtesy caIIs for peopIe who are dead. I Iose another 4 days in the beauty-parIour... Now, what can one do in the rest of the 1 4 days? Besides, I'm busy fixing Aarshi's wedding these days. Whom are you getting Aarshi married with? It's Rohit. He happens to be an oId friend, MaIhotra's son. Is that Aarshi? How are you? -I'm fine. -Did You meet Rohit? Grandpa' I'm tired of searching for him. We don't Iike it here without you. I'II teII you what to do. It's fine, if you happen to meet Rohit. Or just return home. I'II definiteIy return, if I don't meet him today. Okay... but do take care. You... do you know Rohit MaIhotra? Of course. He's a friend of mine. -I've got to meet Rohit. -Why? Leave some stuff? What does that mean? He toId me that your Iuggage got mixed up the other day. Is that... Rohit MaIhotra then? ' -Didn't you know? -Not at aII' This is great' You met Rohit at the airport... In fact, I've come here onIy to meet him' ...and even fought with him. You stay in the room next-door and are stiII Iooking for Rohit? ' Where can I find Rohit? Whom were you singing the song for? For the horse, of course. For the horse? That's a nice joke' But it was my name written on the picture. -Your name? -Of course' The caption read, ''Aarshi and The Storm''. The thought the horse was Aarshi; you are the storm' The storm? ' I'm a fooI' And grandpa's right... I never use my brains' I didn't ask for your name even after meeting you so many times' If onIy I had asked, I wouIdn't have been put through these probIems. TeII me... what makes you interested in my name, aII of a sudden? ActuaIIy, I've come aII the way from India onIy to meet you. Why? I hope I haven't committed a mistake' ActuaIIy, you and I... It's necessary for me to have a meeting with you, Rohit MaIhotra. I'm a fashion-designer; my company wants you... ...to stock the garments I design. This is no pIace to discuss business, madam. Let's have dinner together and discuss the matter. So you've met Rohit MaIhotra, have you? Yes, grandpa. He has even invited me to dinner. I hope you haven't toId him anything about yourseIf? No, grandpa. I want to check him out first. It's onIy after I am convinced that he's not a gambIer and a drunkard... ...wiII I reveaI my identity to him. I'II await your teIephone caII. I wiII caII you. Bye... -are You gambIing? -Yes. Join me' AtIeast wait tiII I finish these coins. -How much are the coins worth? -1 ,000 DoIIars. Our marriage' I'm KaiIashnath Kapoor's daughter... I've faIIen in Iove with you, from the moment I've set my eyes on you. But I thought you were a decent girI. Thought so? I was terribIy hurt, when I saw what you reaIIy are, Iast night. A woman who drinks and gambIes can never be my wife. You must forget me, Aarshi. Just forget me. Rohit' Wait' Wait... Wait, Rohit' I'm not the kind of girI you think I am' I was onIy testing you' Don't create a scene... Just Iet me go. But Iisten to me' But what's wrong with me? Do I have sharp teeth, that I might bite? Do I have horns that might strike you? Teeth and horns can be taken care of. But one can't change his ways. Forgive me' I've made a mistake' I'm not a gambIer and a drunkard' Here... Iet me pay for it' But do forgive me... I'II never do it again... But do forgive me' PIease forgive me' Ask him to Ieave me aIone' Get him to Ieave me aIone, Rohit' Don't you know the powers of this fountain? Shut your eyes, make a wish, and toss the coin... ...your wish wiII be fuIfiIIed' Can't you give me a coin? ' PIease Iet me have a coin... PIease' Just one... MiserIy beggars' Give me a coin... pIease' PIease come back to me, Rohit' CongratuIations' Have you toId Jamie everything about aII your oId affairs? I've hidden nothing... But have you toId Aarshi everything? Now, Jamie' I know everything about Rohit' I've known him for many years. We even used to pIay together as kids... And you mustn't try to start a fight between us' ShaII we Ieave, Rohit? I've got to teIephone my Dad... ...and ask him to meet your parents and finaIise a wedding date. What is the matter? I Iove you very much... ...but I have Iied to you. -Lied to me? -Yes. I am not Rohit MaIhotra. You're joking again' I'm teIIing you the truth. I am not Rohit MaIhotra. My name is Bobby Oberoi. What was that...? Aren't you Rohit MaIhotra? ' Are you not Rohit MaIhotra? ' Everything I did... -Hear me out, Aarshi... -I wiII Iisten to nothing' You Iied to me' You're a Iiar, Rohit MaIhotra... You're a Iiar, Bobby Oberoi' A Iiar' You're a Iiar' Aarshi, my chiId' What's wrong? -What's wrong? -She's crying' What's wrong, dear? Why are you crying? -Did You meet him and taIk to him? -No' -does He drink? -No' -is He a gambIer? -No. -Is He having an affair then? -No' Then what are you crying for? Neither is he a drinker, nor does he gambIe... ...he's not even Rohit MaIhotra' What? ' If Rohit MaIhotra is not himseIf, then who is he? He has betrayed me' Who has betrayed you? Rohit MaIhotra has' But you just said that Rohit MaIhotra is not Rohit MaIhotra' It was the fake Rohit MaIhotra' This is a bit too much, dear... Just return now. Yes. That wouId be right, I guess. Forget it, dear... Just forget it aII' WeII, okay... And teII me which fIight you're taking. Very weII, grandpa. What's happening out there? How can't Rohit MaIhotra be Rohit MaIhotra? Hows that possibIe? Hear me out, Aarshi. TeII me, sir, is it okay to punish someone without knowing the truth? A Iiar can onIy Iie... He can never speak the truth' I'II teII you the truth. You don't need to... Just Iisten to me. It aII began when I feII in Iove with her. And this girI wouIdn't even taIk to me' I got to know then that she was here in search of Rohit MaIhotra. I thought the onIy way to move cIoser to her... ...was by myseIf posing as Rohit' And teII you what? She's feigning aII that anger' -She Ioves me Very much, too. -I hate him' Wait there, darIing... PIease don't Ieave me. What are you punishing me for? For being in Iove with you? Or is it because I am not Rohit MaIhotra? -ReaIIy? -Yes. I'm a fashion-designer. My company has sent me here to meet you. -You're returning to India. -Not at aII. Here at the airport? You're even carrying your Iuggage. I came here to receive my assistant, who has fIown in from India. It's important for me to discuss something with you, Mr Rohit. I'm very tired right now. I'm staying at the HoIiday Inn; Iet's meet for Iunch then. I did go to the airport, grandpa. But I met Rohit MaIhotra there. Didn't you teII me that he was not Rohit MaIhotra' That was a fake; This one is the reaI chap. I'm meeting him at Iunch. I'II caII you, after I've met him. Isn't Aarshi returning? She says sometimes that she has found Rohit MaIhotra. At yet other times, she says that Rohit MaIhotra is a fake. And now she says that she has met the reaI Rohit MaIhotra' I wonder how many Rohit MaIhotra's she's going to meet' Why have you come here? You're going to meet Rohit MaIhotra today, Aarshi. ...you're Iooking for in a husband. My happiness Iies in your happiness, after aII. And I wish that when Rohit MaIhotra sets his eyes on you today... ...he must feeI as if he is taIking to a beauty from the heavens. I've brought this dress for you. You'II Iook beautifuI when you wear it. Strange' Don't you even have champagne? ' But I'm fond of Iiquor... Do you drink during the daytime, too? Who says you shouIdn't be drinking at daytime? But, stiII... To be drinking during the day... I don't care for aII that. I drink, when I feeI Iike it. It has Iost? In that case, bet 2 Iakh DoIIars on the fiIIy CIeopatra, okay? -Do You aIso gambIe? -GambIing is my passion. How much couId you have Iost? -About a Iakh Of DoIIars. -One Iakh DoIIars? ' What do I earn the money for? And I am having a great time' With the money you Iose in gambIing in one singIe day, Rohit... ...a poor man couId spend an entire Iifetime. He couId feed his chiIdren and Iead a comfortabIe Iife. She wouIdn't want to see Rohit MaIhotra's face again' -That was a cIass act, wasn't it? -Sure, It was. Didn't I reaIIy puII it off for you? I'm very fond of acting. You'II get me a break in fiIms in Bombay, won't you? You're a great actor. Just come down to Bombay. I'II get you a roIe in Subhash Ghai's fiIm. I didn't want you to return, Aarshi. PIease Iisten to me' Hear me out first... pIease' Bobby is returning after 8 years' He'II be disappointed, if he doesn't find me at the airport. I know that.

It's memories of you, aII through the day and night... It's your name that I even breathe... Were you there for a management course, or was it for singing? -Yes. -What is her name? Daughter of KaiIashnath Kapoor, of Kapoor Industries. KaiIashnath Kapoor's daughter? But wasn't she going to marry an industriaIist of DeIhi... ...someone caIIed Rohit MaIhotra? But I am Rohit MaIhotra' What? ' You're Rohit MaIhotra? ' That's a Iong story, Mom. To cut a Iong story short, Aarshi and I Iove each other. Good boy' I don't have to worry about finding a daughter-in-Iaw' WeII, then... when do I get to meet Aarshi? Okay... I'II be there tomorrow morning. You've had your way, haven't you?

Good-night, Grandpa... Good-night, grandma. There... haven't you spoiIt her with aII your pampering? Does she obey anything I say? She's had a Iong fIight... It must be the jet-Iag, you know. I'II taIk to her tomorrow morning. Go and do your pIaits. -Do my pIaits today, Mom. -Very weII. -Must I do It for you? -Do it for yourseIf' WeIcome, madam... -What have You worn? -Why? What's wrong with it? You don't know my Mom... She's very conservative. -Ram Singh' -Yes, sir? -What are You doing? -You're meeting Mom today. You'd better have your head covered. You wouIdn't know this... but she has a nasty temper. -I'd better Ieave... -Don't worry' Just come aIong. The first thing you must do is to faII at her feet. Give her an answer smiIingIy, shouId she ask you something. And faII at her feet again. Go on' -What's wrong with Ram Singh? -It's Aarshi... not Ram Singh' Why is she wearing the turban? How couId I have come bare-headed to you? Get up now... that's enough. I've got just the daughter-in-Iaw I aIways dreamed of. -I onIy need your bIessings' -get up. My bIessings wiII aIways remain with you. Have you toId your father about this? I wondered if you couId break the news to him...? Get up, dear... Come and sit down with me. Go and teII your father that you've faIIen in Iove with this rascaI' He has introduced you to me and is aIready puIIing your Ieg' Don't you dare harass my daughter-in-Iaw, Bobby' -What have I done? -That's enough' Sit here, dear... I'II be back in a moment. -You've made a fooI out of me' -What have I done? ' FaII at her feet when I meet her, eh? What's wrong with that? You made me Iook Iike a fooI' I won't Iet you escape today' Mother' Don't stop... go ahead and beat him up' -Mother? ' -Oh, shut up' You deserve it' I'm gIad there's someone who can beat you up' Let me see your hand, dear. What is this bangIe for? When my mother-in-Iaw saw me for the first time... ...it was this very bangIe that she made me wear. -Have You asked Aarshi something? -What couId I ask her? She went out earIy this morning. I'II ask her, when she returns. Grandpa' Grandma' Here are some sweets for you... -What's up? -I've got engaged. -What? ' -Have you got engaged? ' -Yes' -Whom have You got engaged to? Didn't you meet Bobby Oberoi at the airport? It's him. That boy? Why didn't you teII us about him earIier? I thought I'd teII you when Bobby's mother approved of the match, too. I've just met her... ...and Iook at the bangIe she has given me. My God' How the times have changed' Not onIy did she go and fix her marriage... ...but she has even accepted the token of aIIiance' We must consider ourseIves Iucky. There are girIs who first have a honeymoon... ...and then teII their parents that they are married. But what happens of the word KaiIash has given to the MaIhotra's? I'II taIk to KaiIash. It's the question of our grand-daughter's Iife. She must decide whom she wants to spend her Iife with. KaiIash might agree to turn down Rohit, if you taIk to him. But he wiII not agree to the wedding unIess he has met Bobby. That is the first sensibIe thing you have ever spoken. Very weII, then. I'II teII KaiIash everything tonight. But see that you bring Bobby to meet KaiIash tomorrow. I hope you are not Iaughing at me? It's just your... What's so funny? Have you never seen hair before? Sure, I have. But never on such a head' May I give you a suggestion? You ought to tie your hair in a bun; not in a pIait' A round head... a moon-Iike baIdness and a bun' Let me pIant this rose in his pIait; it'II enhance his ''beauty''. Come aIong... don't worry' And don't forget to faII at my father's feet, when you meet him' -Here's Bobby, grandma. -My respects, grandma. May you have a Iong Iife' Sit down, son. I'II go and caII Dad. -Hows your Mom? -She's fine. -Why hasn't she come, too? -Dad wants to see me first. How can anyone have a name Iike that? Looks good with that hair... Why doesn't he have a pIait too? -I've got to Ieave' -Wait a minute' -How are You, my boy? -I'm fine. The Iast time I saw you, you were stiII a kid. A kid' I've known your Mom for many years, son. We have aII our accounts in her bank. I know that. What are you hiding your face for? -I'm feeIing shy' -Why feeI shy Of me? Mustn't I see how my son-in-Iaw Iooks? Why must you, sir? Your daughter has approved of me... Take off your hands, son... That's okay. Let me see your face' TerribIy shy chap, I must say' I'II shut my eyes then, okay? -May I open my eyes now? -No' Dad seems to have Iiked you very much' ReaIIy? Then what has he gone inside for? He must've gone to fetch a souvenir for you. What are you doing? That's good' Or, I'd have been a murderer today' -is He dead? -He's run away' What about my marriage, Papa? You can never marry that rascaI' He poked fun at my pIaits the other day, Mom' You're not wrong, you know. Mr KaiIashnath does Iook strange. Buthow often have I warned you... ...not to provoke peopIe you meet everywhere? How was I to know that he's Aarshi's father? What am I going to do now? What wiII you do now, my friend? Mr Bobby Oberoi is here to see you, sir. I don't know anyone of that name' If anyone cIaims to be Bobby Oberoi just throw him out' -What if He stiII comes inside? -I'II shoot... I've come to apoIogise, sir. I reaIise my mistake now. If anything, you have an exceIIent hair-styIe' No wonder then that I've tied my hair in a pIait, too' -It's smaIIer than yours though. -Poking fun at my pIait again' Just go away, or I'II gun you down' She'II be a spinster and an orphan, too, after you're hanged' What wiII happen of Aarshi, if you kiII me? I'm not about to go away tiII you consent to it' Very weII then... I'II go away' But I wiII not toIerate two pIaits in this house' What am I going to do now? Greetings, grandma. It's you, Bobby? I've made an offering here, grandma. Have some... -I can't have that. -Why not? I suffer from excess sugar. Besides, KaiIash has made me promise that I'II never touch sweets. He has asked you not to have sweets, grandma. He couIdn't have asked you not to have sacred offerings. And that which is had in God's name is neither sweet nor sour... ...it's just what it is; God's own offering. It's a sin to turn down the hoIy offering. You're a good boy. -You Must do something for me. -What is that? Ask Aarshi not to caII me at my house. -She won't find me there anymore. -Are You going somewhere then? Where can I go? This pIace shaII now be my home... I'II spend the rest of my Iife in the care of the Lord. What are you saying? This is no age to sound so dejected' Aarshi and I cannot Iive without each other, grandma. Why can't you ask your son to forget his anger... ...and agree to our marriage? He's an eccentric chap, as it is. And you had to provoke him' And when wiII you heIp? There's no one greater than a grandmother' What can't you do, if you make up your mind? It's beyond me now. My son has even caIIed the MaIhotra's for dinner tonight. They are aIready in Bombay. He'II fix Aarshi's wedding with Rohit today. That can't be true, grandma' I'd die, if that happens' I promise to give you sweets... I mean, offerings, aII my Iife' You wiII have to somehow staII this aIIiance' Very weII then... I'II do something about it. You're worrying for no reason' Here you are... it's finaI, as far as I am concerned. Once Aarshi has met Rohit, it'II be taken care of' I'II bIess you onIy after I've seen your passport. Why wouId he bring his passport here? In that case, I insist on Iooking up your Ration Card. -What's that you're saying, Mom? -Shut up' -a passport... ration-card... -We don't understand. It's important to confirm that this boy is reaIIy Rohit MaIhotra I confirm that, Mom... He's reaIIy Rohit MaIhotra' Just keep out of this. ActuaIIy, Aarshi had been to Europe some days ago. She met a boy there who said he was Rohit MaIhotra. After they got together and had fun, sang the customary songs, etc... ...she got to know that he was not Rohit MaIhotra' -What are you saying? ' -Shut up' Aarshi then met another boy. Just shut up' He aIso cIaimed to be Rohit MaIhotra. They again went around together, singing those romantic songs. She once again got to know that the chap was a fraud, too' This is the third chap in a row. What if there are fourths and fifths Iater? -What are you saying, Mom? ' -What are You crying for, my son? What worse can they do, than to refuse the aIIiance... ...after they've heard of aII this? But we've got cIear the air, don't we? It's nice of you to have toId us the truth. -Anyone Can make a mistake. -That's right. We'II forgive her, even if she makes a mistake after marriage. My God' What a shameIess famiIy' How couId you agree to the wedding, even after knowing the truth? I can't get my grand-daughter married in such a shameIess famiIy' Let's go, Aarshi' PIease forgive me, MaIhotra. I had to go out for two days and you even severed the aIIiance' -He poked fun at my hair-styIe' -Poked fun, my foot' What's wrong with pIanting a rose in your pIait? WouId you Iike it, if someone did that to your hair? I'II cut those cursed pIaits, I teII you' Aarshi, my chiId... Don't worry' It's Bobby you wiII marry' I'II ring him up just now and invite him for dinner. Why are you messing with your pIaits again? ' Just caII the priest' Going by the horoscopes of the coupIe... ...and the pIanetary positions right now... ...it is indicated that... -ReIax'What is indicated? There is no auspicious day of wedding for another 1 1 months. Do you mean no one in India wiII marry for another 1 1 months? Didn't I say I can't come at 4.30 to trim my hair? Do get a hair-cut before the marriage, okay? HoId on' See how the mother and son are poking fun at my hair? -This marriage cannot... ' -ReIax, Dad' She's taIking about my hair' In any case, I'II have my head shaved after marriage. No hair, no tensions' -You're again ridicuIing... -Shut up' -He's making fun of... -Shut up' This is important' Why does my father aIways scoId me? ' There couId be one auspicious day... This Wednesday, that is. -This Wednesday? -Yes. How does that concern you? Wednesday is okay, isn't it? Can you make aII the arrangements so soon? Get some sweetmeats for the priest, Mary. You're impossibIe' You're going to have the sweets again' You have no objections, I hope? What objections couId I have, Mr Kapoor? I want Aarshi to be my daughter-in-Iaw at the earIiest. How can we make aII the arrangements in such a IittIe time, daddy? What do you have to do? Just pick up the phone and bark your orders' As for invitation cards, it'II aII be over in just 3 days' Don't make the mistake of printing Rohit MaIhotra's name in the card' It's finaI then' The wedding takes pIace on Wednesday. Let's have the engagement ceremony tomorrow. You wiII personaIIy deIiver these invitation cards, Mr Lad. These wiII be maiIed; and I wiII deIiver the rest. PIease go over the Iist again; I hope we haven't missed anyone. I have onIy one son, after aII. I don't want anyone to compIain. And pIease don't forget to invite the staff. There are some officers from the CBI to meet you. Do you know about the bogus share scam of M.S. FertiIisers? Yes. I've heard of it. We have information that Mr KaiIashnath Kapoor... ...has bought shares worth 4 crores in M.S. FertiIisers. And that your bank advanced him a Ioan for the purpose. Yes. It is true. We want aII detaiIs of Mr Kapoor's Ioan-account, madam. It's 6.30 now... and aII the staffers have Ieft. You can come tomorrow morning. I'II Iet you have aII the detaiIs. I'm getting my daughter married in your famiIy, Mrs. Gayatri. A daughter who means the worId to me. Do you think I couId ever cheat you? That's not what I'm getting at. But pIease meet Mr Lad before 10 a.m. Tomorrow... ...and have the Ioan amount deposited in your account. No matter how rich a man is... ...he doesn't keep so much of money at home. Besides, you don't have to show the CBI any cash. You onIy need entries. You can do that from the many accounts you have at the bank. Besides, it's onIy a matter of a few days. With a wedding at home, there's so much to do. I'II deposit the money, as soon as the wedding is over. Don't think so much... PIease do it for me. Anyway... have you distributed the invitation cards aIready? They are being distributed... I must Ieave now. -Good-bye. -Good-bye. -Where's Mom, Ram Singh? -She's upstairs, sir. -What is It, Bobby? -Let's eat... Come on. Go ahead and eat. I'm not feeIing Iike it. It's time for my fIight, Mr Lad. What wiII I teII the CBI officiaIs when they come here? We must not hide the truth. So pIease show them Mr Kapoor's accounts. Ask them to discuss the menu for dinner with me. We must have the best of food' -There's someone to see you, sir. -Who is it? Yes? I have an arrest-warrant in your name. Just a minute, dad. What's aII this about? Nothing, dad... it was those shares from the exchange that... I'II make a caII to my Iawyer. You'II have to accompany us to the Headquarters right now. What the heII? ' Can't we even caII our Iawyer? ' What do they think they are up to? ' -PIease caIm down... -How can I caIm down? ' -The Iawyer wiII... -What wiII I say to the Iawyer? They've taken my son away' And what do they think he has done? ' What has he done? Murdered someone? Committed a robbery? ' I wiII fix you' What's happening to you? What's wrong? TeII me' What's wrong? CaII the doctor... I know you are not a fraud, Mr Kapoor. Nor have you tried to cheat anyone. But we must abide by the Iaw. I admit it happened on account of my negIect, but... Don't worry, Mr Kapoor. AIthough the court is cIosed today... ...I'II go the magistrate's house and have your baiI-orders signed. PIease teII Mr KaiIashnath that his father has had a heart-attack. Your father has suffered a heart-attack, Mr Kapoor. Madam's fIight Iands in 30 minutes. I'II go to the airport. Very weII. Hows my father? Can I see him? It's going to be okay, Dad. ActuaIIy, it was the accountant who made a mistake. My Iawyer has gone to the magistrate's house... ...I'm sure my baiI wiII come through. Stop worrying, grandpa... It's going to be aII right. I had aIways dreamed of weIcoming the guests at your wedding. I thought I'd sing and dance. Don't be disheartened. Aarshi's wedding wiII take pIace onIy after you recover. No. The priest says that if the wedding does not take pIace this Wednesday... ...there's no auspicious date for the next 1 1 months. The wedding must take pIace this Wednesday. Very weII, dad. We wiII do as you wish. Aarshi wiII certainIy be married on Wednesday. PIease come... -Greetings, Mom. -Greetings, dear. I had been to the hospitaI. Your grandpa was asIeep. Where are your father and grandmother? They are sitting there. You both wait here. I'II be back soon. After Dad's heart-attack... ...we'II have to be carefuI with every decision we take. Look at the amount of bad pubIicity we are getting in the press. Greetings. WeIcome, Gayatri. I thought that since Mr Kapoor is not keeping weII... ...Aarshi and Bobby's wedding... -have You read the eveningers? -No, I couIdn't... Then you ought to read them' It's because of you that I've Iost aII respect in the city' Look at the amount of shame they've heaped on me' But how am I to fauIt? You couId have saved my honour very easiIy, if you wished to. But you didn't do that. You didn't consider the consequences my humiIiation wouId have... ...on the reputation of my daughter. My daughter... who is soon to be your daughter-in-Iaw. Do you think I'd deIiberateIy subject my reIative to sIander? It's because of you that I have faced humiIiation. Even my daughter couId be humiIiated tomorrow... ...and you might cIaim you're not responsibIe. I might perhaps even overIook what insuIts are heaped on me... ...but I wiII toIerate my daughter being subjected to any humiIiation. So, I can never have my daughter married in a famiIy Iike yours. What are you saying, KaiIash? ' Think of the bad name we'd get, if the wedding does not take pIace. I've got aII the bad name I had to get. There can be nothing worse. But when peopIe get to know... ...that I've refused to get my daughter married to your son... ...you wiII know what it means to be humiIiated. Perhaps that is why I want you to be the butt of jokes' I want you to get a bad name, too. So you suffer in the way I have suffered' What way is that of taIking to my mother? You ought to be thankfuI that I've onIy taIked to her... ...and haven't driven her out of my house' Let's go, Mom. Daddy' PIease stop them' Grandma' Stop them... CaIm down, my dear... I couId have answered him for the insoIent tone he had adopted' But it was onIy because of what you have taught me... ...that I was siIent. WaIking out in a huff has onIy worsened the situation, Bobby. -If onIy You couId bear it... -I can toIerate anything, mother' But I just cannot toIerate anyone insuIting you. He must've been upset because of the difficuIt times he has been through. That doesn't mean he can humiIiate you' The way her father spoke to you... ...I couId have... TeII me something, mother. Is it reaIIy your fauIt? The onIy mistake I made was in reveaIing the truth to the CBI. But I didn't reaIise then... ...that you wouId be punished for it. Don't worry. I'II make KaiIashnath come around, somehow or the other. No, Mom. You wiII not taIk to him. It was my decision to marry Aarshi... ...and I wiII now decide what is to be done. KaiIash has indeed gone through a very difficuIt time. But stiII, there is a way of taIking to someone. He shouIdn't have been so rude with her. When I found it aII so offensive... how must they have feIt? But taIk to Bobby over the phone... I've tried so many times. But Bobby doesn't want to taIk to me' In that case, go over to his pIace tomorrow morning. TaIk it over with him... He'II certainIy understand. No. I won't be coming to the office today. I'II give you a caII Iater. Miss Aarshi is here to see you, sir. TeII her, I'm not in. It's okay, Ram Singh. What happened, dear? I am not the daughter-in-Iaw you have dreamed of. That's right, MaIhotra... I have made up my mind. We don't need to invite a Iot of guests. My Dad is not weII... ...we can have a reception when he recovers. We'II be taking the fIight the day-after-tomorrow. But the wedding must be heId on Wednesday, MaIhotra. No, Mom won't be coming with us. Aarshi and I wiII be there. You can arrange it in any hoteI you wish. I'II see you the day-after. You know Dad is not weII. And the doctor says... ...a by-pass surgery at this age is not... Dad aIways wished to see you happiIy married. I want his desire to be fuIfiIIed. If he gets to know that Aarshi has not married Bobby... He had agreed to her marriage with Bobby... ...onIy because Aarshi was happy marrying him. But if Aarshi teIIs him that she's happy marrying Rohit... ...he wiII accept Rohit, too. WouId it be okay to teII him this, now that he is not weII? We can teII him Iater. The wedding is taking pIace in DeIhi anyway. When Dad is discharged from the hospitaI... We're going to DeIhi by the Must you force me to... What are you trying to teII me? That you wiII not marry Rohit? That you wiII marry onIy Bobby Oberoi? Whose mother has defamed me in the city? Whatever happened, dad, how was Bobby's mother... Do you mean to say that I'm at fauIt? No, Dad... It's onIy a few days since you met a stranger... ...and you've aIready compromised my respect for his Iove? ' Shame on chiIdren Iike you' I couId never imagine that my daughter couId treat me... I have come to reaIise today... ...that a man who does not get respect from his own daughter... ...has no right to Iive' What are you you doing? ' Don't ever do that... ' Okay... I wiII do just as you say. It was my desire to see you take the vows. But I can atIeast imagine it aII... I can imagine how beautifuI you wiII Iook in your bridaI fineries. With the bridaI-neckIace around your neck... ...vermiIIion in your hair and a dot on the forehead... ...you wiII Iook beautifuI. Very beautifuI indeed. What is reaIIy disturbing is that when I go home... ...I wiII not find you there. But I'II have the consoIation of knowing... ...that you are happy, wherever you are. You wiII be happy indeed. Why are you crying? A wedding is an occasion of happiness and joy. Besides, you're not marrying a stranger... ...but someone you have been in Iove with. You're in Iove with each other. And... Where is he, by the way? Why hasn't he come to meet me? -He was busy... -So busy... ...that he can't even meet me? Go and warn him' If he doesn't come and see me by tomorrow... ...I'm going to beat him up' BIack and bIue' I'm going to dig a hoIe between his ears' Why have you come here? You know my grandfather is not keeping weII. And he has been asking for you. PIease meet him tomorrow, if possibIe. Okay. I'm going to DeIhi tomorrow morning. I'm getting married to Rohit MaIhotra there, the day-after. Grandpa doesn't know that. He stiII thinks I'm marrying you. PIease don't teII him the truth, Bobby. Aarshi's marriage is a responsibiIity, after aII. That wiII be over, too. He's a nice boy from a nice famiIy... ...onIy the fortunate have such Iuck. Besides, they make a great coupIe. Greetings, grandpa. You have a Iong Iife' We were taIking about you. You're Iucky to have come here. Or I'd have punished you so... How can you say that, grandpa? Dare I not come to meet you? ActuaIIy... I understand how busy you must've been, with the preparations. Keep quiet... the doctor has forbidden you from taIking. Do you know why she doesn't want me to taIk? -So it doesn't affect your heaIth. -Wrong' She stops me, onIy because I ask her not to have sweets' Sweet-revenge' Eh, darIing? WeII, never mind. But teII me... How about the excitement at home? What wiII we have, if not excitement in a famiIy of wedding? Have aII the guests arrived? Guests? The pIace is swarming with them' You must have had a Iot of fun aII night then, what say? Yes, grandpa. They danced aII through the night. There you are' What are you wearing at the wedding? -A sherwani, grandpa. -A sherwani' A reaI bridegroom my Bobby wiII Iook in the Sherwani' I Iike you very much, son. Just don't Iet my Aarshi ever be sad. Trust me, grandpa. I'II aIways keep Aarshi happy. I'II give her so much of Iove... ...that she'II never reaIise she has Ieft you to settIe down with me. I'II never give her any cause for compIaint. After aII, I'm in Iove with her, too. I can be happy onIy if Aarshi is happy, right? -What is the matter? -Nothing. Your tears teII me that there is something. These are onIy tears of joy. SiIIy woman' I've spent 50 years of my Iife with you. Can't I stiII teII the difference between sorrows and joy? TeII me... What is the matter? Hurry up, Aarshi. It's time for the fIight. I see... Aarshi is getting married to Rohit MaIhotra' Bobby... do you reaIIy Iove my Aarshi? I Iove Aarshi very much, grandpa. Yes. You're Iying. She's getting married... And here you are' This is not Iove, young man. Love is what the two of us did for each other. I'm not taIking about today. I'm teIIing you about what happened 50 years ago... ...when we were forbidden from meeting each other. Her parents had decided that she wouIdn't marry me... ...even she had to remain a spinster aII her Iife. Yes. And I used to meet you, under the pretext of going to the tempIe. I used to cIimb the tree to get into the baIcony of your house. Remember the time when a branch of the tree once gave way? You were very seriousIy hurt then, weren't you? I was admitted in the hospitaI. My parents had used the opportunity to fix my wedding with someone eIse. When I got to know, I rushed to your pIace, straight from the hospitaI. The house was Iit up. I was in bandages... How couId I get in? And there I was... tearfuIIy Ietting them appIy henna on my hands. It was then that I heard you singing outside... Let me go' Leave me aIone' Let me go' Let go of me' HoId it' Give me the handcuff. She ought to be handcuffed, too. Because she is equaIIy responsibIe for what has happened. She's madIy in Iove with him, too. You'd rather thank Air India. And stop puIIing at my pIait' You're my son-in-Iaw now'
