DEAR GODDAMED FRIENDS My name is Martini Gino, at that time I was 20 and a half years old. I remember everything as if it were now, it was 26th of August 1944. On the 12th Florence had been liberated by the Americans. Actually, more than anything else, they were English… ...who have always been selfish and arrogant towards conquered peoples. In any case, in Florence neither a cracker nor a dry pea shit. We were so hungry! Locked at home for more than 15 days... ...without light, without water and without gas... ...to eat the straw of the chairs. Sor Dieci, wake up. The curfew is over. Well done, right now! There was a guy who was eating an omelette sandwich... ...and he was about to give me a piece. - Then he goes back to sleep. He's finished it by now. Light the charcoal, they're on their way. My partner must have been in his fifties or thereabouts! He had been a professional boxer, but only briefly. In fact they had nicknamed him "Ten"... ...because he was often knocked over for the total bill. For this he had left in boxing gloves... ...and he started being a solicitor, a coach... ...and middle-of-the-notch meeting planner. I'd met him at the gym, where I used to throw a few punches. "Let every citizen preserve their behaviour and dignity..." "... which a civilized people must have to prove themselves worthy of liberty." - Understood? - Will this "water heater" walk? Don't worry, my brother-in-law cares more than his eyes! - Here is Callicchero. - Hello, Sor Dieci. - Damn me! - Fantastic! Fantastic! - What did you bring me? - That. - Who is this starving man? - A starving man! Fortunato Calamai, Mr. Ginepro Parodi... ...said Ten because... - Forget it! - Is this the heavyweight you promised me? - No, that's Righi. But he didn't come because yesterday they killed his father. - Fascist? - A little, but not to kill. - What do I do with this? - But! The stature would have it. - How big is your chest? - Not much, they even reformed me. Why? Do you have to be big? Do you think you'd be a heavyweight? Can't you see yourself? We hope you get along with the technique. Holy shit! - What can you do? - I get along pretty well with... - What's this? She-she She said there are plays to be done. I manage with the march of Aida. But I'm a mechanic. Sor Ten! They are not performances, they are boxing exhibitions. - Didn't you tell him? - I was vague not to impress him. - Boxing? - Yes, I'm raising a colony of boxers. We go around the newly liberated countries... ...to revive boxing, buried by war. As a bag we take everything, even stuff to eat. - It's a brilliant idea, don't worry. - No, I'm not calm. - I've never thrown a punch in my life. - Neither do I, nor does he. - Ciccio, look, I... - I do it out of hunger. Don't worry, I'll tell you everything there is to do. And then, more than anything else, it's about pretending. What's the harm here? - To who? - Aren't you in line? - Yes, from 6:00! - A contingent of Canadian potatoes has arrived! - From the watchmaker? - Madame, these are times of great confusion. Maybe they'll give us the clocks at the greengrocer's. - Please, can you hold my seat? - Yes, but don't tell anyone about it. - What he said? Potatoes? - Here's the line. But don't push. - Respect the queue, go to the back. - I'm here first. Giuliana, they're giving you potatoes at the watchmaker's! Oh, respect the queue order! - Let's make things right. Who's first? - The four of us. - Hey, where has Taddei gone? - I warned him. Sor Dieci, I would like to go and see someone near Steccaia... ...and I'm also good at boxing. - Juniper, damn you! My husband is looking for you. He noticed the truck, bring it back to him. You had to distract him by doing it... And I made him do it while you stole it tonight. But I can't make him fuck at all hours! Look what he did to me. - Bring it back to him or he'll cut me off! - I'll bring it back in two days full of stuff. - He'll thank you. Go, hijack it. - I already have a broken nose! - But what's the harm here? - Potatoes. - Number 52, madam. - Thank you. - No, come to our place. We have an urgent commitment. Let's go guys. - And Taddei? - Let's go get him home, he'll be asleep. - Then wake him up. - Pack your bags. No, get off! You have to push. - Do they give potatoes here? From the watchmaker? - So they said. - What do you want? - Potatoes! But go away! Exploiter! Starve the poor people! - Where? - At number 38. - Are you sure? We've been friends since we were kids. - Is it before or after the arc? - Before. - There's a sniper there. - There are quite a few here. Wait, "34"..."36"... Here you are. - "38", brakes. Brakes! -I'm braking, but he doesn't stop. Here the sniper catches us! - The gear does not engage. - Let's go, it's dangerous here. Keep calm. However, we learned two things… ...the use of reverse gear and the use of the brakes. To stop at "38" you have to start braking at "22". - Let's remember that. - Here we are, it's on the first floor. You sound the horn. - What did he say? - Which does not come, it was clear. - His mother doesn't send him. -Big and thick as he is? Since her husband died in Russia... ... she clings to her son like a crab. To get him reformed she got screwed by the medical captain... ...from the deputy federal officer and then from the foreman... ... her and managed to keep it attached to her skirts. It didn't seem real to him, so he didn't go to war. - Then let's leave it alone. - But he's the only one with a decent physique. Take the bracelet back there. He is here. I hide because he knows me. There is no current! - Who is he? - Open up. - Is Taddei Vinicio here? - No. - Search the house. Wait a minute, who are you? - E.S.L.P., People's Liberation Subsidiary Army. - What's this? A new, popular army that joins the allies. - Son of him is precepted. - What does it mean? - He means "recalled". Weren't you under the bed? - It's the first place you look. - It's better that he goes with them. - Madonna of the poor things! - Watch out we slam him against the wall! - He is ill, I have the sheet of Ià. Where did you get that sheet from? We know everything. - Medical captain, the federal, head of the block... - It's not true. Considering his pain and seeing that he has so spoiled his son... ...I allow her to make him a small basket with bread, cheese, cold cuts... Do you have finocchiona? Coffee, sugar and vegetables. - What! At most I have a couple of OVIs. - All right, go for the OVI! Holy shit! Sor Dieci, brakes. Brakes! Perfect! Everything is fine. Perfect. -But he had taken measures with the brakes. - I hadn't calculated the descent. Now we know this too, let's remember it. There are paint cans and brushes in there. You make a nice writing on the tarp. The others with me, let's go. We are accumulating a large amount of experience, we will treasure it. It's really lucky. Guys, I've scooped up a lot of good stuff. See how he jumps rope there! Even a child can do it. - It's just that I'm too long. - But how long, you are denied! Hold. Go see if they've left any cups back there. Hopping! Step forward, extend your left! Step forward, dodge, reach left! Step forward again. Step back, up with the right! Two steps back, quick! Excellent! If there were ropes, you would bounce and come out of the corner. Keep it up. Callicchero, carry over the shoulder. - But so I get back on the muzzle! - The boxer always keeps his arms high. Hit with the whole shoulder and then dodge. Go, quick! Go! - Madonna! He-Learn to dodge. - Sor Dieci, I found one. - So we do the awards in the ring. - Learn to dodge first. - With boxing gloves you feel better. - Go, boxing! - There is a gong, shall we take it? - Put it in the basket. Keep your arms up. So go! Snapping boxing gloves, it's shocking. Even blowing through the nose is impressive. Blow your nose! Go with your nose! - This also affects the audience! - No, what a pig! Not about boxing gloves! Then rub them on my face! He drips me. Let's go guys. I have done. Therefore, the public of the markets and fairs... ...it's not the one of cinemas, it needs something strong. The first meeting must be chilling, dramatic. Such an effect is obtained only with a knock out. Couplings: first meeting, that of the knock out, Taddei-Martini... ... second meeting, the technical one, Callicchero-Calamai. Then the two winners will meet for the beautiful. - Who would be the two winners? - Him and Martini. - So I should go knock out. - First round. Martini withering right and you collapse to the mat. - What's up? - I don't collapse. - Why? - I don't let that half saw beat me. - I'll break you! Don't be a fool! Sor Dieci, I'll go down instead of Taddei, so we can finish it. But no punches in the face, my Gigliola has been waiting for me for 13 months. Don't worry, I'll show you how to do it. As soon as you see a clearing, you stop. Come, Calamai. So, Martini makes a Dempsey combination. Right to the heart, left to the jaw. I don't touch you, you tilt your head back and roll your eyes. Ready? Right to the heart, left to the jaw. - Nothing happened. - Holy shit, I broke my head! - Stop, there's a sign. - Stop, there's a dangerous bridge! - Turn! Turn! - Do you want to stop? - Stop! Go left. - The engine has stopped. The handbrake, Taddei! - Brake! - Stay calm, nothing happens. Courage, take some stones. - There is an eraser here. - Grab her! - There are no stones here! - Hold up! Reggi! No, that's my suitcase, imbecile! The situation is under control, stay calm! Keep calm! Great experience! - Callicchero, wedge. - Here she is. Look how small my suitcase is! There are the prisoners! Even these shitters sing! Look at that truckload of motherfuckers! - "Deutschen", you got it in the ass! - Horned! - We played them for you, Germans! - You have horns! - "Bucaioli"! - Cuckolds! Fennel! Grab this SMG! - Good thing they're prisoners. - I'm thirsty. - Let's rinse off. - First come first drinks! take off! Oh, that was needed. - We rinse your face and you put your feet up! - Don't break! - Get these feet off! - You broke my balls, wash yourself! Put your hands down or I'll drown you! So, you can't go through Bibbiena. Too bad, there is a magnificent fair there every Friday. But in Monteriggioni today is the feast of the Patron Saint... ...and we can't miss it. Boss, are you sure these days... ...in all these countries there are so many parties? - Certain. It's the end of the war, people want to forget, to have fun. - They spend and spread! - Nobody really has a lira. All right, maybe they don't have the money, maybe vegetables, chickens, sheep, citrus fruits. Look. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Excuse me, can I ask for information? - Sure, tell me. By chance... ...have you seen this lady? This is my lady, Ernestina Bertolazzi in Fortini. Eight months ago she was displaced by her relatives in a villa in Reggello. I go there to get it and I never found it. It's strange, no one has been able to give me an explanation. When I ask, they are all evasive. She disappeared into thin air. Sorry, we didn't see it. - Nice pussy! - If you should meet her, tell her I'm looking for her... ... that she shows up, that she returns to Arezzo. Do you allow? - Please. - A refresher! - Did you hurt your feet? From one of my uncle squadrista... ...ex squad member... ...I had inherited a nice pair of black boots with brown trim... ...like "Chantilly", pre-war stuff. On my way back from Reggello I stop along a stream for a refreshment... ...I take off my boots... ...I rinse my feet, then I rinse my face... ...not with the same water, because the river flows and the water changes... ... I turn to take the boots, but they had disappeared into thin air! - Like the lady. - Good boy. I would have started crying in anger and sorrow. - But those leaves? - The fig leaf is large, robust, fat... ...but sometimes he wants water. By the way, have you seen a fig tree nearby? - Because a replacement is convenient. - I'm not sure... ... but it seems to me that after the curve there is a wild one. Fine thanks. However, if you find out anything about my lady... ...or the serious theft of boots, this is my calling card. Thank you. Congratulations. Wifeless and bootless, what an element! War is a very ugly beast. Hit her on the head. Take it, damn you! - Sounds easy? - Come on, Taddei, put it on! - But I squash it. - Better, let's do it to the devil! - Press the accelerator or we lose the hen! -She's too far away. - And take it easy for a moment. - Get off! She-she She went over there. - Holy shit! - Take it! -Where is she? -She's gone. - Pig Judas! - There is no more. - And now? - Damn, we missed the hen! - You had to step on the accelerator! - What do I do if he doesn't give me gas? Coupons. Let's reason: the hen has a hen's brain... ...so he can only have sex or food on his mind. - We don't cheat on food, we don't have it. - He wants to make her all in love with her? - "Ganzo"! - No! Here it is, come back. Go! Catch her! I got it! Beautiful chick! - Let's wring her neck. - Wait a moment. Sor Dieci, she's really in love, she's crushed. Speaking of "cotta", shall we make it boiled or alla cacciatora? Lessa, with her broth we make the most of it. A hen like this would be good... - Put that hen down! - Ugly thieving thugs! Drop the chicken! Damn you and your babbi bucaioli! - Shoot! - One moment! We are from the Liberation Subsidiary Army... Boxing. The pullet is seized. You can also be the Holy Trinity... ...but if you don't put the chicken down immediately, I'll shoot you! At least sell it to us. How much do you want per kilo? That doesn't sell, it lays eggs. - Go away! - Sell us the eggs. - Otherwise potatoes, zucchini... something. - We have an almost new chest. - New but ancient, it belonged to my grandfather. - Ma'am, we can't eat a chest. - We are not woodworms! You come down, you don't reason with machine guns. Here is dad! - At the Town Hall they know nothing and give nothing. - As? I shaved, cleaned shoes, it's not worth sawing! - But you are "crazy"! - Everyone says so... ...if you kept an American soldier hidden, they give you 5,000 lire. - They say that in Florence it is written on posters, is it true? - I don't know. - But I've heard it too. - It sounds to me. - Did you understand? - It does not appear, father. - They say to try Allied Command. - You asked where is he? They know saw! Morino, you are good and I don't want to hold anything against you. But we kept this black face for 6 months in the cellar... ...at the risk of being shot. We taught him to speak. - If there are no allies, the mayor pays us. - Podestà is bucaiolo! - Then you're not going back to Carolina's. - North Carolina, no woman. - My country, North Carolina. - You don't move until they give us the money. War is over, I like to go back to my country. I make you a proposal. We go around the countries, sooner or later we find an Allied Command. We return the nigger and get the price... ...if it exists. I like the risk, I offer you the certainty for the uncertain. I give you 500 lire and you give us the black with full exploitation of the rights. Take or leave. It's the same for you, let's say we hid you. It's more equal if 20% is for me. - 10%. - Okay. "Or..." what? It was the first time we heard "OK". He means he's fine with it, they say so. You know that 500 lire, whether you have it or not, becomes 1,000. I'm in, done deal. - Johnny! - Dad! A moving farewell scene followed. The old woman also wanted to bless him and we all had shining eyes. We had never seen a black man in the flesh... ... and she amazed us that they too aroused feelings like us. - Come on, Washington. - Ready, boss. Turn around. Let me impress your superiors. - Boss, these aren't Americans, they're British. - It's the same. The jacket. - Guys, you stay "hidden", you look like pet-robbers. - Let's hope! Let's go. Don't talk, just translate what I say. OK boss. - I speak and you translate me. - Agree. Stand out, show yourself well. Good morning. This soldier is Washington Kelly, of the Third Fusiliers... ...escaped from a German POW camp. We hid him and fed him, as if he were a white man... ...for 9 months, from 15 December 1943... ...the day of his heroic escape from the Fucecchio prison camp... ...that you know well, don't you? - No. - He said no. - He's fine, he doesn't know Fucecchio. But he certainly knows the allied ordinance... ... according to which you give 10,000 lire to anyone who brings a prisoner of war. This is by way of partial refund and also acknowledgment. Translate. - No. - He said no. Undoubtedly there is a discrepancy of opinion… ... some say you give 10,000 lire, others say you give 5,000. 5,000 are enough for us because we are in a painful economic condition... ...and then because we don't want to speculate for having bred him. - Done deal? - No. - All right, fine. Damn! Maybe you can't... - Get off you idiots! - Fuck you! "No! No! No!" - I'm sorry, boss. - Cute as hell! Where did you read that they pay them? - I haven't read it anywhere, it's a rumour. - A voice! Guys, let's go, otherwise we'll get to Monteriggioni when it's already dark. Sor Decimo, now what do we do with this morino? - We paid for it and we keep it. - But nobody wants it. - Maybe he even wants to eat. - Good deal we did! Guys, I'm worried about you! Do you realise that you go wild at the first difficulty? And then, it is said that we won't get the prize. Because those are English, they are not Americans like him... ...are two completely different races. Look at him. Stand up. Guys, we have an amazing ass! Look, this is a fantastic natural light heavy weight! And he's also black... ...and this gives the team weight and international credibility. Gives the whole colony a quantum leap! We're really lucky. Now let's push! Come on, push! Push! Force! Come on! Come on, he got it! To the other window. Ask where the ferry is. Sorry comrade, is it true that there is a ferry around here? - Do you think it's time? There's a house full of fascists. - Is there or isn't there? - Is there a party in Monteriggioni? - Down the slope... - Holy shit! - Come on, let's not ask any more questions. - Get out of my balls or I'll shoot you! - He's pissed off. - Careful! - Sor Dieci, slow down! Where you go? - Brakes! - Keep calm. - Brakes! - Keep calm. - You go easy! - Brakes! - I can't swim! Let's drown! Excuse me, but do we always have to stop like this? What are you stupid? Still, this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Look at those people! Come back or we'll call the guards! There was seriously the fair in Monteriggioni. The square was full of people, stalls and street vendors. More than anything, she was filled with a longing for peace and fun. For more than three years we had lived on curfews, blackouts... ...cold, dark, bombs, shootings, bad news and persecution. The sad times are over! We have freed ourselves from the tyrant. We got rid of the German and those sons of bitches of fascists! Attention, keep an eye on the ace. - Where's the ace? - There. - I don't know. Lost. In 10 seconds I melt. Ready? Street! 1, 2, 3... ...4, 5, 6... ...7, 8, 9, 10! - Look who's here. - It's "Fig Leaf"! He still hasn't found his wife. He didn't even find the boots! - Miss, sorry. -He wants to shoot? - No thank you. I wanted to know if by chance he saw somewhere... ...this lady. - Who is she? - She is my lady. Here she came bad, but she has a beautiful mouth. Didn't you see her? No, I don't know her. And these? - These what? - My boots, they were stolen from me. - Have you seen them around? - Sorry, I'm not a shoemaker! Anyway, if you know anything, this is my contact details. Citizens of Monteriggioni, come, there are no tickets to pay. Soon, four real champions will perform in this ring... ...and they will show off their talent, their elegance... ...of their courage and their physical strength. If you are satisfied, we will allow ourselves to pass between you... ...in the interval and at the end of the event... ...so that you can show your generosity. The demonstration begins! Attention, for the key meeting... ...we have on my right Washington Niger Kel... Niger Washington Kelly, also called "The Maul" of North Carolina. North Carolina! - On my left, the brave Martini Gino! - Thank you, I love you! Champion in 1941 of the Gruppo Rionale Rupolini Firenze. Do you understand what a champion! At that time... It's fine, let's not bullshit. Dempsey combination and you go down. To the corners! Boxing! - So? - Break! - But give yourself some punches. - Then I go knock out. Yes, but first make a scene. One step forward, one step back... Boxing! - We got this! - Break! Give yourself some punches. Boxing! Go, but tap slowly. - Whose is this dog? - Take him away! Go away! Take him away! 1, 2, 3... Go down, imbecile! 4, 5, 6... - Thieves! - Go away! - 7, 8, 9, 10! Knock out! Wins by lightning knockout in the first round... Does it give us anything? For me he won the dog! Madam, nothing? Nothing? - Good morning. Does it give us anything? - I have no change. - But he has aubergines. - They are for my house. - Sell them to me. - No. I have to take them to my girlfriend, she loves them. - How much does she want? - 10 lire. - I'll give them to you right away. Wait. Here I have only 5 lire. And here 5 more. - Here. - Goodbye. And now, watch out, three-round sub-match. We have the tough Neddi Mario, known as Callicchero... ...against equal weight Taddei Vinicio, aspiring to the Italian title! What equal weight! He doesn't even reach his navel! - Hi. - Hi. - 10 hits for these eggplants. - Not even for 2000! But not with this one. I'll let you shoot all night with your personal shotgun! - Thank you. - Think about it, man. - Aren't you ashamed to take it out on that little frog? - Shut up! Come on, shortbread! - You hurt me. - So she changes jobs! Are you dumb? Are they serious? - What a bang! - Count it up, referee. - 1, 2, 3... You son of a bitch! Get up, Sor Ten! - Damn you! - So, earn the bag! - Cursed son of a bitch! - So, go! I'll break everything for you! Take this, this and this! Perfect, give generously. Thank you. Give these guys an incentive. Thank you. Thank you. I'll give you a financial year report... ...that goes beyond all wildest expectations. 7 potatoes, 22 tomatoes, 8 EGGS, 2 loaves of bread... ...4 ears of corn, 2 courgettes, 8 sausages, 2 melons... Give the dog a cheese rind, he fought too. - He's not hungry, it's gluttony. - Throat? Look. - He ate the cap! - Give him the wine, he'll like it, he tastes like a cork. - Sssh, good! So 4 aubergines... - No, boss, these are mine. All right, let's delete them then. And then we have 818 lire. We put them in the box. - Boss, can't we get a pack of cigarettes away? - The athlete does not smoke. I don't smoke, but a hole to sleep... It's summer, he sleeps in the truck. This applies to everyone: what is not necessary is a vice. - I have the "pussy" habit, but it's a necessity. - Not for the jock. - I would have found one, the one from the shooting gallery. It's "good". - Who? Where? - Free or paid? - Half and a half, he would have given it to me for the aubergines. Holy shit! I was afraid of catching some disease to go with that. Bravo, those of the shooting gallery are the first to pester you! - I've had it, I'm vaccinated. - Idiot, it comes back to you, it's not measles! Let's organise a poker game, are you interested? I must have played four or five times. I just know the rules. We are all beginners too. - Are you looking for a chicken? - Jokes? Let's play a game to while away the time. Let's go. Let's go get peeled! - Good evening. - Good evening. Lawyer, come. - Who has the cards? - He. - Whoever takes the highest gives the cards. - All right. - But will he be good? - He winked at me. - The aubergines are gone! - Callicchero too. The aubergines, Callicchero ... he's gone to the rat! - Ugly pig! - Washington, check the stuff. "Attention, Radio London here." "The porches are long. I repeat the porches are long." "End of first communiqué." "Second release: the valley has bloomed." - Piece of shit, get out! - You too, you filthy boobs! - Make us fuck too! - Give me the aubergines or I'll go to the police! Shut up for a moment. But there is nobody here. - Wait. - Cork, stand still! Guys, there's nobody here. Where they went? The dog finds them, it's hunting. He has to smell Callicchero's stuff, it's on the truck. Come, Cork! - Here you are. - With these socks you don't need the dog, I find it too! - Go, Cork, look for him. - Catch him! Run! - Finished? - No. - Well done, Cork. - Shut up. - There they are. - Come on, I'll take care of it. - How long will it take you? - How much I think! - My back hurts. - Be good. - At that time? - Wait a moment. - Catch him! - No! - You liked them, huh? - The eggplants are mine! - Give them back to me! - They're not yours, he hadn't consumed yet! - I'll rip out his ears, pass him to me. - Don't push! Are the Germans back? But no, they are the party firecrackers. - Come here, you, where are you running off to? - Ugly petty thief! Lazarons! All men are the same! - Just when I was there! - It takes stomach to go with you! Look at this one. Oh, are you drunk? - War pig, it doesn't end! - It ends, very slowly, but it ends! - Where did all the stuff that was on the table go? - The boss took it. - How was the little poker game? - I know saw! But boy, that's the common fund! Only the handkerchief remained. I don't open. I bet 10 lire. - 50. - The carabinieri. - Does your phone work? - Not always. Try it, Brigadier. - Good evening, accountant. - Good evening. - How are you? - Let's say I took a load off my stomach. - Silence! - Excuse me. - What did he do? - He shot one. Three shots at point blank range, like a dog. He must have found the one who screwed his wife. Man is man! - Silence! - Yes sir, but it wasn't me speaking. Carabiniere, can I put on my boots, please? - These leaves are dry! - No, I'm the body of the crime. - The body of the crime? - The poor guy was wearing them. Ah, it's not what his wife stole from him, it's the one about the boots. The boots are my property, I can prove it to you. Inside the left boot... ...the name of my uncle is written, Pelosini Adelmo. Look. - I believe it! Nothing, let's try the pharmacy phone. - Let's go. - Yes sir! If you meet my lady, tell her she no longer finds me at home. - Where are you taking me? - In Montevarchi. - You can find me in the Montevarchi prison. He's lost his mind! - So where were we? - It costs 50 lire to play. - I leave. - One moment. - The potato says 50. - No, the potato shuts up! - If he doesn't have the money, we stop playing. - Guys, who's covering for me? Huh? - Here it is. - 5 lire missing. All right. So, 2 sausages, a scented melon... ...2 eggs... ...and 2... That's enough. All right, I see. Three beautiful whores! Stairs. - Stairs? - Straight to king. - With two cards? - To me, sometimes, it also comes with three. She went very well, exceeding expectations. - I tell you, better than that you die! - Of hunger! What's up? Is anyone still not convinced? First: The performance went very well. Second: we earned money and provisions. But the most important thing is that we understand that the idea works. And then, we sensed that the world is full of scoundrels. Let's remember that! If you remember, Sor Dieci. How to play poker... ...with one of the wheel of fortune... ...and another playing the three card game! All right, but you have to be sure of the future. And to be on the safe side, we'll take turns keeping the cash register. I defer to the majority. I see a pear tree. We are in a democracy, what does the majority say? - They are "thigh pears"! - Do you also get horny with pears? - Be careful, the farmer is here. - We are too many, we get noticed. You two, go get wood for the "water heater". We pretend to have an engine failure. - Open the hood. - What? - Bend over! Wait, look at those beautiful blackberries. - How do we get them? - I'll make you the ladder. Easy with these big feet, you're hurting me! It's a minefield, there's a sign. - And now? - Let's shut up, we play a joke on him. - Also not to impress them. - For me is the same. It's a minefield, there's a sign. How did we not see it? After the war, there are pitfalls and dangers everywhere. Let's remember that. Still, this is an important experience. Yes, but you have to warn them both. Meanwhile, I'm safe there. - How did they get there? - It's a miracle. - Ass! All right, guys, we need to warn them without alarming them... ...otherwise they lose their heads and end up on a mine. - I'll handle that. Calamai, what is the country of your "ganza"? Pile rack. But what do you care to know right now? To warn her in case something bad happens to you. - What's going to happen to me, dumbass? - A bomb, an explosion... - We are at war, let's remember that! - Don't make unchallenged speeches! "Mines"! - That says? - "Mines"! - Where is that crazy guy going? "Mines"! "Mines"! Our Lady of Pears! There are mines! - Keep calm. - "Calm down" a saw! What do we do now? Do something, you shitheads! Now be careful: slowly descend from the tree... ...and retrace the same route you took on the outward journey. Possibly on one foot, it's better! Put your feet in your footprints. I'm not moving from here until the deminers arrive! Call my mom! Stop everyone, I'll take care of it. Come down, leave it to me. - But there are mines. - Get off, I know where to go. - Get off! - All right. - Down, come on! But are we sure? - And now? - Now I'll show you, scoundrels! - Sons of bitches! - Farmer, you're hurting us! - Get out of here! - There are mines. - We all die. The mines are gone, I left the sign for thieves like you! Remember that my stuff is sacred, whoever touches it I'll break the ribs! Damn you, you scumbag, shithead! God bless you! Six against one and nobody lifted a finger. - It's true, and we're also six boxers. Let's go. - Stopped! You're right, Callicchero, six against one is for cowards. That's enough for me. Hey, you bugger! Come here, I'll make your ass like a house! Holy shit! Stop! - Street! - They hadn't taken them all off! - Go, quick! - Let's go, guys! Push! Go! Well, he's gone. You have to remove a curiosity from me, I've been wanting to ask you for a long time... ...it is true that natural redheads like your Gigliola... ...they have a particular, wild smell. Is it true that they are more "bone"? Executioner world! - Wake up. - What's up? I heard a noise, someone is there. She's a woman, take her! - Go away! - Well done, Cork. - Be good. -Look at how she squirms. Washington, go light the lantern. Give me the bag, let me see. - What's in it? - My eggplants. - Thief! - Give me your arm. - Come on, get up. Show your face, come to light. Show the muzzle. - She is a fascist. - Troy! - What does it mean? - He's dealing with the Germans. She was shaved so that everyone knew... ...and to show it in public "delirium". - Ludibrium! She means that she is a collaborator, a fascist. Washington, she be a big bitch, slut... ... that she was sleeping with Germans and Black Brigades. - Torturer and slut! - I was auxiliary. - I worked with the Germans and slept with them. - Then you're a bitch! Enough! She admitted to having been an auxiliary. - Let's take it to the CNL in Montevarchi and they can see it. - No! - Be good! - No! Not those of Montevarchi, after what they did to me! They threw me in a square and there I kicked, spit, laughed. Ugly pig, you'll have to get a punishment. You also stole. If you let me go, I'll make you all make love. - What do we do? - Let's count who goes first. - Go. - No, I don't, I have my Gigliola. - One less. - Two, I don't wear my "bischero"... ...where the fascists put him. - It's not about that. But this shaven looks like a boy, and I don't like boys. - Washington? - I with white woman can not. In my country, if a black man goes with a white woman... You understand? I understood that we are a nice club of faggots, not boxers! Right, boss? Then the two of us go. Callicchero, you go with her, I think I'm going with my daughter. - Do you have a daughter? - No. Damn you and your mothers' sluts! You made me want to do it. Send her away. Hey, did you hear? Go away. Hey! You can also keep that one. - Do you have a place to go? - No. - I stay hidden until my hair grows back. - Live horse! - Do you have a place to hide? - I wanted to go to my aunt's. She is a nun, she lives in Volterra. But I'm on foot. We could approach it. Should we go around with someone who is immediately obvious that she is a fascist? Everybody go shit! - You said she looks like a boy. - Yes but... Then he is a boy and he stays with us. Don't drag your feet. Raise your arms, breathe deeply… ...and fight with the shadow, the athlete's bread! Bread? We haven't seen any since this morning! Breathing and legs are very important. - But we are not athletes, let's pretend. - We do performances. Guys, let's go all the way up to the top there. Boss, don't run, she's a girl. But what a "girl"! You are a man, please, let's remember that. "Come on"! - I have "thick" legs! - But when does it arrive? What the fuck is going on? - Luckily, it's over! - What the fuck happened? Guys, this time he's really dead, let's bury him! Shut up, you fool! My brother in law says: "Engines are like people..." "... they need care and food." Is there charcoal? - Yes, a little, but it's all off. - So, you who are a mechanic... - Who? I? - You're not a mechanic? - Yes, but of bicycles. I see, boss. I tanker. View? Negroes in America can do everything, like whites. - That's why they won the war. - "Transmission" not good. - Meaning what? - Piss oil. - Speaking of pissing... Holy shit, what's going on? If we don't get to the Montevarchi fair in time, it's a catastrophe. - Try to fix it. - I don't know if I can, boss. Anyone who doesn't piss in company is either a thief or a spy! Who invented this bullshit? I don't want to piss. What are you doing here? - More thief and spy than she is! - There are the Americans. Calm down. Fasten your flaps. Don't be afraid, I speak English with them. Keep calm. Americans, halt! Stop! Me friend, Salavat Militar. No, look, Salavat Militar! We saved your commiliton. - Where is it? - Who? - The soldier you saved. - Is he injured? - What a Feruto, it's Washington! Washington, come out! Washington Kelly, tanker. - Come out, brunette! - Where the hell did he go? He was under the truck. Have you investigated it? Hand! He was a prisoner and we took him. Now we're returning it to you and, as the circular on the posters says... ...you give us the sum that is written there. - In what condition is he? He's fine. We fed them. He eats like a beast, it was a catastrophe to meet him! We also taught him to talk. We give it to you as new. "Listen", paisa'! If so, we don't care. - As? - You can keep it. We are the Health Department. "Understand", paisa'? Do you understand? - As? - Do you want a tip? Take it back to the tankers. To the tankers? But holy shit! - What is your department? - We have no department. Throw it down. We are a group of boxers. "Box Club." Enough, come after us! Why? We did the Americans a favour. Let's not make so many starlings! If the boss says accussi', accussi' it is! But the truck is broken. One moment. What happens? What did he say? You come with me. You stay acca', OK? It's all that shit nigger's fault! What happens? Want to see them blame us for the nigger's disappearance? Then we're doomed. What he said? I don't understand you. - Over there? - I don't know. Come on! - Guys, what does that mean? - For me it is the last meal of the condemned. - Smell seems good. - Even the flavour. - Spaghetti! - Guys, if we are going to die, better on a full stomach. - There is no wine here. - What are these yellow biscuits? They taste like night stand! - Can we get some milk? - There is none. - Yes here it is. - But that's dust. - Yes, the Germans used it too. - What is this green thing? - Pea soup. - Soup? What a bitch! What are these drinking? - How does it taste? - Between the oil and the armpit. Ah, it's a purge! It says Caca-Cola. Guys, everything is fine. It's done! "Done" what? When I entered there… ...there was a soldier with a terrible face... ...a chest full of medals, pissed off like a beast. He told me: "You are infiltrators, you are spies!" "Electric chair, court martial, concentration camp!" - All together? - So I said... ..."We are a group of indomitable fighters of the 'noble art''... You are ignorant, "noble art" is English, it would be boxing. And then I said: "I propose you a show..." "...which will cheer up the wounded..." "...and will cement the friendship between our peoples." That's four fights... ...each of three shots lasting three minutes. 12 oz gloves, that do next to nothing. Him tonight at 21:00. - Did it end like this? - No. As a bag they give us everything: blankets, canned goods, deodorants... ...stylus pens... those new pens they have... ...chewing gum, liqueurs, chocolate... ...razor blades, socks, shoes... - The punches? - What punches? - Those of tonight, at 21:00. - Americans are boxing champions. - Better the electric chair! Would this be gratitude for how I conducted the negotiation? These are amateurs, just like us. "Such and such" a saw! They are three times our size. - Especially the black ones, they're scary. - What are you saying! Here we are in a hospital, they are all injured... ...are debilitated, they go to the ground with a sneeze! - There are also nurses though. - They're all nurses. - I saw drivers, warehouse workers, cooks and soldiers. - All queers! - Is there any wine? - There's beer. - Give it to me. At that time... ...if by chance... How disgusting! If anyone gets into trouble... ...exploits the Dempsey combination, throws himself down and goes knock out. - Is there still the royal march? - Why don't you play it? Let's go guys. You hold the flag. And you come with me. A restful meeting. You have to be very calm. Breathe well. Now I'll give you a massage... ...which facilitates circulation. - Easy, it hurts me. - But how bad! It's a meeting... - Where are you going? - Did you see him? - America is watching us. - I care about a saw! Take this off. Sor Dieci, I throw myself down immediately. Don't worry, sometimes looks can be deceiving. May the best win. Go to your corners. - She felt my balls. - No, she checked if you have the shell. - Low blows are forbidden, there is disqualification. - Really? Boxing! - What happened? - He went. - What if he won? - Did you see the nigger? - Did you knock it down? - Death to the Americans! Here is the fascist! - How did you do that? - I kneed him in the balls! We are not. With a disqualification like this, boxing is offended, Italy... ...and the Americans are offended for not giving us the purse. - I don't take punches in the face. - If we don't fight... ...they kick our asses in the street! - Who's next? - To you, but it's better that Martini comes, he's more experienced. - He'll blow them the wool over his eyes. - I can give him the roast. - All right. Turnip head, he wears gloves. - Yes. They're new, I haven't even punched them. I'll give it to him, it's within my reach. Be careful, it's red fur! He also has a tattoo on his arm. Boxing! Cover up! - What do you care to attack? - 1, 2... Or sun... ...oh my sun... Little black face, beautiful Abyssinian... Shut up, you moron! So you provoke them even more. Stay covered! - Don't get up before 8. - 1 2 3 4... - Why? - Then I'll explain. - 5, 6, 7, 8. - Spaghetti! Spaghetti! - Give me the sponge. Perfect! Put it behind his neck. Now some air. Breathe deep. On the first shot throw yourself down. - I want to finish the match. - There are still two rounds, are you stupid? If you don't jump down, I'll throw the towel. If he tries, Sor Dieci, I'll kill him! Prepare the cot. - Here we are. - Open the cot. - He gets up! - At that time? - It's down again. - Open the cot again. - He gets up! - Still? - He's on his stomach now. - Mattress. - There he is. I've never seen so many punches all at once. - Let's arrange the boy's bed. - Here's a nice pillow. - He got up. - Is he kidding us? Come here, come back to your corner! Back to the corner! He can't hear us any more. Come, I'll take you to sit. Better not, otherwise I won't get up any more. You made your figure, we earned the purse, what do you want? I want to finish the match. He is behind you! He hasn't given up, he's always standing there. Red slams him repeatedly on the ropes... ...but he continues to stand. He prepares the bed, Calamai. He takes some beatings ... Incredible! Incredible! It's destroyed. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7... Get up! Well done Spaghetti! Knock out! - Come on, Spaghetti! - Go to the mat! Enough! Well, he won! Victory! - Guys, he got himself butchered. - Cool! - I use the Calamai method. - Another knee and they'll kill us all. - Let me do it. Callicchero, it's your turn. Courage! Don't worry. Luckily we are in a hospital! That's okay. - Get up! - Low blow! - Get up or I'll disqualify you. - I can't do it. Boxing! Don't attack! Stay covered! Cursed! - Not with the stool! - Take this! You too! The seconds are neutral. Fuck you! They could have confiscated our bag and maybe even the truck. Instead the Americans, who had enjoyed themselves, kept to the terms... ...and they gave us everything, even green powdered soup... ...which continued to sadden our dinner even after the war. Come on! Come on! - Guys, do they give us the honour of arms? - Or are they kidding us? Since it's not clear, let's be on the safe side. Introduce yourself, arm! Introduce yourself, arm! - Hello friends. Everything OK? - Where have you gone, traitor? My comrades gave you so much free stuff. Maybe for free! - Did you sell your uniform? - Washington more divided. Washington deserts and goes to a place where no one knows. I free. Guys, we're travelling with a fascist dressed as a man... ...and with a black American deserter disguised as an Italian. - Fantastic mouse! - What are those chairs? This is not a living room. They smashed everything. Do you have panties? - Does the train pass? - They have reactivated the Regola-Ponticello section... ...but only for allies. - When does the train come? - He's got panties on. - We have to get to Florence before nightfall. - If I let you pass, will you take me there? - Certain. Come, miss! - Where we put it, there is no place. - The place is there. - He can get on my lap. - Hey, young lady! - Without baggage. - I'll take the bag. What a bummer, guys! - Soon! - Make room! - Ouch, you hurt me! - Put that here. Miss, we have left you a wonderful place. - I'll give you a hand. - I feel it! She also brought wine. Please come. - What is your name? - Rocchi Wilma. Health to all. - It's good wine, my father makes it. - We missed that. Americans don't even know what it is. Martini Gino. - Lucky Calamai. - Pleasure. - Parodi Rino. - Before her they called her "Ten". - Because... - Forget it! This is Callicchero, Washington... ...Taddei, Testa di Rapa and Cork the dog. - Hi. Let's go guys. What happen? Holy shit! - Will the level crossing stay like this? - Who do you want here? For Florence you had to take the right fork before the toll booth. - From here it stretches. - We have to go to Steccaia first. To the right is a shortcut. Two or three kilometres and you see the Steccaia bell tower. Other than a shortcut, we've been walking for more than an hour. - Until you see the bell tower... - How do you do it? It's almost sunset. Hey, Romeo, I'll disembark you and then you'll manage! Sor Dieci, wait a little longer. Look, there's a woman. Bella donna, is this the right direction for Steccaia? You passed it, you have to go back. We have not seen the bell tower. The Germans knocked it down because of the partisans... ...damn them! - Damn who? That's why I couldn't find it. - Full back! - With this war we no longer understand anything. Gigliola! I'm lucky! Gigliola... I surprised you, huh? Long time no see! Ma'am, good morning. I'm Lucky, do you remember me? I'm Gigliola's boyfriend, I brought her aubergines. - What do you want? - I'm here for Gigliola. - I saw her, she was at the window. - You were wrong, Gigliola isn't here. - Madam, she was there. - She left this morning. - Are you kidding? - No! - How long has he not seen her? - For more than one year. What a mess! - What a trick on him! - Call it a joke! - But is she pregnant? - Heh! Don't comment. Guys, we can go away. We had a wasted journey. Gigliola isn't here, she's gone to Florence. Her sister told me. His sister? I heard you call "Gigliola". - Her name is Gigliola too. - Why? - Because they're twins. But if they're twins, with the same name and the same dress, you know what a mess! What the fuck do you care? Let's go. - Have you seen how it fits? - I'd be in Cork's place. Turnip, two more blankets! Yes. Give it here. - You don't come with the others? - I'll come in a bit. Washington, go get some wood. - Otherwise we won't move tomorrow. - Okay. But I can't see, it's too dark. Get an American torch. No, you don't touch those, they'll be snapped up in Florence. Bring me a can of meat. Also take the brown fizzy drinks, there's half a box left. - I have two hands! - And take two trips. It's the war's fault. Look what a mess. Look at how the cities, the countryside and the villages are reduced... ...people, me, you. And then who told you that it was a disgrace? Women must stay away from the athlete. Who cares, I don't want to be a boxer. Think about it, maybe it was lucky for you. You were lucky. Imagine if it happened when you were already married. You realise? - Oh, I was here! - Pig Judas! What do you have in here? A rock? I broke my sacrum! It will be the compact. - Miss, are you staying in Florence? - Depends. - The flashlight? - Washington has it. - He shouldn't have taken it. - But it's dark. And the corkscrew? How do we open that? Go get it. A glass, Turnip. How long are you staying in Florence? All I know is that I'm not going back with my lousy father. My mother spent 30 years with him in that tollbooth... ...with swollen legs and flag in hand. She died without ever having even been to Lucca. Whatever will be, will be! If you don't know where to go, you can come to me for a while, I live alone. - Alone? You live with your mother. - But it's like I'm alone. I run away from my father to get with someone who lives with mum? Rather, since he's on the street, would you be interested in a wedding party? - He eat, drink, dance. - Who is getting married? The partisan "Drago", have you heard of him? Dragon? Pig Maremma! A first-rate brigade leader! - The terror of the Casentino! - Turnip, besides the hair you've lost your mind! We're friends, we hid him at home for two months. I would gladly shake Drago's hand. Where is this party? In Borgino, it is 6 or 7 kilometres from the Certosa. A wedding party, but also an end of the war. An outdoor party on a farm. Good wine... By the way, Turnip, what happened to the flask of wine? - My name is "Rose"! - Rose? - Yes, last name. - Do you have cigarettes? - Yes, who knows how many cues each. - You have nothing to do with it, you don't smoke. - I don't smoke, but I sell mine. And now I offer these to you. Turnip, bring a carton of cigarettes. What are you doing, stupid? What's wrong with you? - Hey, stop! Can we know where you are going? - Where I want! - She is a woman. - Don't be crazy, come on! If they catch you, you can end up badly. Why do you want to leave? What have we done to you? You are nothing, Sor Dieci. I don't have it with her. You are a gentleman. I have it with those! They are a bunch of animals, with no pity or respect for someone like me! - You men have nothing else on your mind! But women too... - I want to go away! - Where to go us? Wait for the right time. One has to stay on guard at the pick-up truck. We have Washington left, he didn't want to wear the club suit. "WP" means "war prisoner", "prisoner of war". No, it's "Long live boxing". - Boss, it's better if I stay. - You are scared? Come, let's have fun. - Washington, you go. - Chief, watch "war prisoner". - Callicchero is right, go! - But boss! I'd like to take a picture of me shaking Drago's hand. - I'd like to show it in Florence. - Wait here. It means we're friends. Wilma! Hello, Dragon. I came to wish you and her a happy birthday. - You don't mind, do you? - No, let your friends sit down too. I brought back your golf, your letters... You left me this one because she could be of use to me. - Now I don't need it any more, I'll give it back to you. - To the ground! - Start the war again! - Get them! - Take him inside. - Don't let them get away. - Hands up! - Ugly bitch! - Fascist assassin! - Leave her. No! "War prisoner", they are fascist prisoners of war... ...escaped from a concentration camp. The girl had already been marked by partisans. Follow me. Come on, the others too! Let's go. Comrade Dragon, my boys and I are victims of a misunderstanding. These overalls were given to us by the Americans as a sign of gratitude... ...for an exhibition hosted by my boxers... ...for the wounded in the Gavorrano field hospital. The girl, I swear, was raped by her mother because she had lice. Tell him, we have nothing to do with this story! We were invited here, but we didn't know anything. Let them go, coward! They have nothing to do with it, blame me. The partisan armed forces... ...have received the recognition they deserve from the allies. Therefore they must abide by the current laws of war. Today, 29 of August 1944, in application of Paragraph 7... ...which provides for the death sentence for the attempted massacre... ...I sentence you to death. -But I'm an admirer of him. - At the wall! - Why, guys? I had come here to take a picture with her. - We did nothing! - Shut up! - We're innocent! - Cheer yourself up, have some dignity. - They sentenced us to death! - My fault? - A little for everything. I swear by Jesus, Our Lady, all the saints, my mom, we are innocent. Do we make them dig the grave or do we leave the corpses to the pigs? No, I want the pit! I want to be buried. - You dig too. - Before I die should I go to work? - So let's live a little longer, prick! - Work, bundles! Stop! I'm John Washington Kelly, United States Army. Prisoners property of American command represented by me. Turn these men over to me, the United States Army. At the wall. I'm John Washington Kelly... The Geneva Convention... Work! That's enough. You command the firing squad. Take a stand. Ready. - I wish I had the last cigarette. - Good boy. Here she is. This has never smoked. Go on. Upload. - I want a priest! - Ready. Coward, have the courage to shoot me instead of this bitch. Bet! - One moment! - What's up? - Traitor fascists shoot themselves in the back. - Right, turn around. Commander Drago, Parodi Ginepro, known as Ten... ... he asks to be shot in the chest. - All right. But then enough. Long live Italy! Fire! I heard the shots. Callicchero, did everyone shoot you? Get up! - Sor Dieci, what happened? - A unique experience. Now fuck off, let us eat in peace. And you, thank God I have a witty wife. What a story that happened to us! We won't even have the will to tell it. We suffered a joke, a great joke... ...and also very funny. - I didn't enjoy it. Fun? What if she had killed Drago and his wife? I still can't believe I'm alive! You are alive, don't be afraid. Unfortunately for us, you are alive! But we have here in the truck the most important thing... ... God bless you, it will be at least six quintals of stuff. Divided by five they are 120 kilograms each. We eat our families for a month. Shall we give nothing to black and white? No, we picked them up on the street, they're not part of society. Otherwise we would have to give something to the madwoman and the dog too. Indeed, let's download them before arriving in Florence. What the fuck is going on? There's one every time! - Engine shit! - The Americans fixed it. Horned Americans! Everyone get off! - "Get off" I say it! - Everyone, even the women. - Come on, Turnip, push too. - All we do is push. Let's push, come on! Come on, Turnip. Wilma, be careful, you'll burn yourself there. Force! Come on, disengage the clutch. - To leave or not to leave? - Leave, leave! - She went. - Oh, stop! - You son of a bitch! - Shit! - They're taking away all our treasure! - Damn you! Hole thieves! We hope you crash! A year and a half later we read in the newspaper that Washington Kelly... ... he had been stabbed to death in the Pineta del Tombolo... ...we were very sorry. Testa di Rapa, on the other hand, is alive and has a hairdressing shop. It was better if they had shot us! Those were special times... ...the worst that can happen to a generation... ...even if now, talking about it, my voice trembles with nostalgia... ...and not just because we were 20 years old. Now that I'm almost old and I don't like anything any more... ...I understand why. Maybe surviving is better than living. What does it do? Fight with the shadow. It's athlete's bread. Let's do it too. Go!
