Reverend, it's foggy, we can't see anything in a distance of few miles. Listen, Kau Lin Mountain is dangerous, there may be cliff hidden in the fog. Ask anyone to go ahead to lead our way. Reverend, I hear someone riding. But I can't judge how many horses are coming because of the echo. Be alert. Reverend, are they robbers? Not exactly, in order to avoid misunderstanding, show our flag. Yat Yeung Tze, why don't you show your flag? Show our flag? We have only two, don't you think it's necessary to show our flag? But you are different, you have many people in your team! Show the flag! Go and take a look. They are coming, ask first , don't mess up. Oh, they are the Shaolins from Shun Mountain. Oh, they are the Hung Tung School of Martial Arts. Don't worry. Luckily the Shaolins show their flag in time. We are short of time, I don't want to make any trouble. Right, we don't want a fight at all, do we? They don't seem to be your students. This is Mr. Yat Yeung Tze, the Master of Tein Chong School. And that is his student Ma Kwun Mo. Tein Chong School? We seldom hear this name. What? You come to join the congregation without your flag? Master, I think we'd better make a flag of our school. -How can you be moved easily by others' words? -No... -But how to make a flag? -We're in this world of martial arts, we can't be in such a low profile. -Just tear a cloth from our knapsack, that's OK? -How to write on the cloth? Blood! Use blood, it means sincerity. Will it be too bloody? No. What are you doing? Use your blood. Who said so? Don't make us feel shame. Master Sheung Kun, let's hurry for the congregation now. Don't waste time, let's go. Let's go. See the great team of them! We have two in our team only, how can we compete with them? But we can't be absent, this congregation is organised by the court. There are so many troubles in the world of martial arts. That's because our territories are not clearly drawn. So the nine schools of martial arts are gathered to discuss the boundaries. If we don't come, our territory will be taken over by the others. I don't know why you insist to maintain our school? Our Tein Chong Mountain is so poor and infertile. We should inform all the students, that we are closing down our school. so they can do whatever they like, maybe bodyguard, or street performers, any trade. All our students are having family burdens. Don't keep them in the poor mountain! We shouldn't be that passimistic, you'd consider optimistically. What? But I always consider alone! Well, pay my money which you borrowed before being the master. If we lose our territory, then we have to depart, it's such a big martial arts world, where can I get you? It's good to do the farming at home, why should I learn Kung-fu? Have you finished? Why do you insist me calling you master? Good advice is always not acceptable. But I haven't finished yet. So windy! Look up, what's that? What is it? My God, it's such a big bird! Somebody is riding on it! Somebody? Chase the crane, let's see what is it? Wait for me, Master, I am left behind! Damn it! Go! Stop fooling me! You are great! They go forward, and you go backward. You are always different. Give you some water. The horse refuses to go, and the well is dry. It's within my expectation. Calm down... Damn horse! I will beat you to death if I catch you. How can you run faster than a horse? Wait! Wait! It's a cliff! Hold it! I am almost scared to death. I've sucked many kinds of leaves before, but I haven't been so comfortable. I should have got more for emergency. Where do these leaves come from? You are... the one who rides on the big crane? Yes. You are the first man I have ever seen. I am called Pak Wan Fai. Don't tell others you have seen me! An angel! I'd better worship him now! I must tell anyone that I have ever seen you. Angel's leaves. Listen, hide your weapons, don't show them up. So as to avoid any misunderstanding. The slogan of the congregation is "We're a family, protect the world of martial arts together." "We're a family, protect the world of martial arts together." Pals, we are a family, protect the world of martial arts together. Of course, protect the world of martial arts together. "We're a family, protect the world of martial arts together." Stop bluffing me. Where does this pig come from? Kick it out... Master Sheung Kun, you can't cook here. It's a nasty world, I'm afraid the food is poisoned. So, we cook our own food. Forget about him, let's cook. Yes! Kwun Mo, they said they didn't reserve room for us. Kidding? We have no reservation? They said, they only provide rooms for those big schools. The rooms are all occupied by the big schools. Master, I am so tired! You deserve it! Who asked you to carry so many stuffs for this trip? Don't you think it's going for examination? From this trip, I know we don't have any status at all. As the master of a school, you are not respectable. OK, would you please cut the crap? I will negotiate with the organizer, wait for me. He'd know how the wind blows. He is so old and... Hero, you're stepping on my book. The Analects of Confucius, the Doctrine of the Mean... Sir, the master of Tein Chong School would like to see you. Ask him in. This is General Tsao Hung. Sir. How are you? I am Yat Yeung Tze. Don't worry, I will arrange the accommodation for you. Thank you. Yes Sir. This is the present territories of the schools. Tein Chong School is right here. Round it up. Tien Lung Tribe? Right. This is the newly developed school, the master is called So Pang Hoi. His most powerful weapon is money! Many people from different schools were bribed by him. His power grows rapidly. So the schools hate him very much. But it's difficult to resolve the hatred. The citizens will suffer if there are riots in the world of martial arts. If the negotiation fails, there will be more fights and riots in the martial arts world. Since Tein Chong School is a small school, they'd better leave here. Give way, the table belongs to our Wah's School. It's full! We can't get any seat. There is a seat. Miss, would you please let us stay for a while? I will leave right after my master returns. I am too tired. Does the leaf of the San Su flower smell nice? The books dropped! Miss, you seem to have forgotten... Nice looking? Not exactly, I am afraid you would get cold! No. You are fond of looking my body? So, you'd let me see yours too. What are you doing? It's embarrassing! Do you really want to take a look? OK, up to you! No way! It's seen again! Mr. Heroes, please come and have a look. Where are you coming from? You are so brave! Get away, the soldiers from Yin Wan's troop are here to maintain order... What's you looking? Who is going to make trouble here, will be caught right away! Who dares bothering our Tien Lung Tribe, just come out. What have I just said? Right! Go and eat right now. If you want a fight, go outside. OK. -Give way, give way. -Don't move! What a bad luck! How dare you confront our Tien Lung Tribe? Go to hell! -He is up there. -Let me teach you a lesson. Red. White. Yellow. Green. I would catch youl! I could make it! -Angel? -Stop fooling here, your Kung-fu is too poor. Let me teach you the "Flash Step". "Step on the two poles, gold and wood position would give you power." "The phoenix dances in the water." Go inside! Come in. "Your body in the first and second divine diagrams." "And your mind be concentrated." It's really crashed. Crash again. I have got it. It's crashed. Stop playing tricks. "All return to normal, the earth links up north and south." "The Legendary Flash Step" Kiss me why? Don't give her advantage. Come back! Have you got it? What? Master? When have you started to like such game? I have searched you in the mill for half day! By mistake only. Go, the men from Tien Lung Tribe are catching people! Freeze! You'd obey the government laws although you are the men of the world of martial arts. The Yin Wan Troops are right here. We will catch whoever makes trouble. How dare you! Why are you so cocky? Arrest me right now. You... Shameless! This stance is really hard to resist. Lady Jade Flute, your brother is the Master of Tien Lung Tribe, but you mess up in public, don't you afraid this would lose his face? Are you scared? Useless! You men, if others give you chance, you won't accept it at once, if others ignore you, you would beg for it again. What a trouble! Do you agree, Mr. Hero? You too. Brother. Master, Lady Jade Flute is messing up again. What's wrong? She...she undressed herself in the public. Isn't it funny? She is too wild! Remember, who dares touch my sister, will be castrated by me. And whose legs and hands will be chopped off. So, they can never touch my sister! So Pang Hoi, please give me face of not making any trouble. Let's discuss it in tomorrow's congregation. Tsao Hung, your Kung-fu is not well-known in the world of martial arts. And your status, is zero. Even you are now under the government, you are just a small potato. Now you just want to get fame from the congregation, so I don't think you can achieve anything in your life. Even I give you face, you are not capable to get it. Go. I am living in room number one. If you are a man, come to me. It's so complicated, we'd better go back to our room. Master. Is our room alright? Anyway, it's comfortable. It's a long way. The ware house? It's not bad, we just want a sleep anyway, right? It will make others jealous if we live in a deluxe room. You are not even demanding! Lady Jade Flute? Pak Wan Fai. What are you looking? I am looking at the cloth. What are you looking? The dyes. We are interested in dyeing cloth suddenly. It must be infected by you. So much money? You always said Tein Chong Mountain is infertile. This is lent by General Tsao for me to do some business. Return it to me. Business? Is he your relative? No, he lent me money because I am honest. Honest? Are you honest? Master Tsao said the world of martial arts is a troubled place. The decent people won't live in this troubled world. This congregation is for negotiation. We are a small school, with limited say. So we can't argue anything, don't you agree? If we don't come out to make our eyes open... We don't know we are having no status at all. If we're not in the world of martial arts, we can't experience so many interesting things. When my master took me to the said world, I thought the same way. -But, what's the result? -When? That year? -How many years apart are you from me? -But, the more you want, the more you may lose. OK, don't give me pressure by the word "Master"! -Are you my master? Or am I your master? -Pay my money back! I'm going to take a bath, then I'll go back to Tein Chong Mountain. You want to escape! Miss, the message from Tien Lung Tribe. The crane riding man appears in Kau Chou Fu. Are we leaving now? Yes, hurry up! Dress up. I am living in room number one, if you're a man, come to me! Why don't you come out? Businessman. Are you calling me? Master, they are dining, isn't it embarrassing to leave now? Forget about it! Let's dine first. They haven't prepared our food! Forget it, anyway, I am hungry. That's right. Heroes, The Tien Lung Tribe has retreated from Kau Chou Fu two hours ago. In order to prevent any poisoned food or water, I hope you pay special attention, and be alert. They all go to the naked woman's side? What are you scared about? The nine schools are all here. It's a nasty world, any message will make everybody nervous. You are too ignorant! Let's go. Let's pack up and go. Do you wanna escape? The eyes are filled with hatred. Yat Yeung Tze, where are you going with your luggage? Do you want to leave Kau Chou Fu? Yes. No...l decided to quit. So I am now going back to Tein Chong Mountain for business. Are you coming to participate the congregation? Why do you want to quit in all a sudden? I guess, you are bought by the Tien Lung Tribe, aren't you? We're not related to Tien Lung Tribe. Tien Lung Tribe needn't a small school like ours. They must be bribed by Tien Lung Tribe. Shut up! Listen! Go and take a look. The noise comes from that way. Bats! Run for your life! The bats of Tien Lung Tribe are poisonous. Go now... Master, run for your life! I'm running! Close the door! Jump into the pool. I've just taken a bath. The big crane? I was lucky to kill two bats. Many people are dying, take the medicine. Reverend! Master, take this. Wake up, Reverend! Kwun Mo, go and take a look at others. Yes! This medicine is useless. Pak Wan Fai! Tsao Hung, it's you who asked us to attend this congregation. Now, the people from the nine schools are all poisoned, it must be you who hooked with Tien Lung Tribe to trap us. My men are also poisoned, if I wanted to make a dead set at you, would I be still here? You are scared that we'll disclose your plot, and you can't account to others. Stop quarrelling! Now, it's uesless to kill him. We'd better save the poisoned people first. Kwun Mo... What a coward! He escaped! Master, I want to report something bad! Our bats' position is totally failed. Who did it? It's done by a big crane. The crane which Butterfly Lam wants? It's true! Pak Wan Fai? Pak Wan Fai. Are you looking for me to give you antidote for the bat poison? What is it? It's the "Scared Text", a mysterious medical reference book. "Scared Text"? I have seen all the books but not this! Are you going to rebel? Catch that betrayer! Stop! We are a family! Aren't you listening to me? "I am asking the heaven with laughing tears!" "I passed through the field with wood on back!" "I planted the flowers under the hill in day time!" "And I pass my time by watching stars at night!" Stop, we are a family, stop fighting! OK, just cuff him now. What? Cuff you. Master, I'm coming! "All return to normal, the earth links up the north and south!" "The Legendary Flash Step!" Master, I am going to get the antidote for them. Where can you get the antidote? From the angel who gave me the leaves. It's not related to us. Don't be that puzzled, just taste it. Don't let them kill among themselves. Or, it's useless for me to get the antidote! That'd be a waste of my effort. Master... Kwun Mo? Master... Angel's leaves? You betrayed us? Don't pull the feather of my crane! How to control this crane? Just whistle. I teach you how to control it. Not necessary, I don't have much chance to play such decent toy! Watch out. How to stop? Just loose your hand. Loose my hand? Well, I will hold you. That's what friends are for. What did you say? Nothing, I grew up in the mountain. Other than my master, I haven't seen anyone. How wonderful! You don't have any worries. You are so lucky! Really? I don't know. Did your master tell you? What? Last time you kissed me, I want to kiss you in return! So, You kiss me, I kiss you, kiss and kiss, when will the kiss stop? We've arrived. Bravo. Let's go together. So high? "And your mind be concentrated." Pak Wan Fai, there is not even a thing similar to a plant! All are stones, what is the antidote? It's not plant, it's a Thousand Year Old Tortoise. We are looking for a Thousand Year Old Tortoise. Tortoise? Isn't tortoise living in the water? Those tortoises can't dilute the poison. Yuen Yuk should have seen the tortoise up from the sky! The crane is high up in the sky, how can it see the tortoise? And here is so hot, the tortoise will die due to the heat. I have to push it out by my "Sound Wave". You'd better go up. Up again? But don't hold it's neck. I know it. Go. Watch out! You finally show up? So big is it! It's really funny! What's wrong? Stop playing, stop! You are not Lam Hoi Ping. My master hasn't come. So, you must be Pak Wan Fai. I have never shown up in the world of martial arts, how do you know my name? I have known your name for over twenty years. Well, you are... The gall of the tortoise... If you want to take it back, ask Lam Hoi Ping to see me. What else do you know about me? Everything. Who is she? I don't know, but she knows many things of mine! A friend! There is a ship. Will she be there? Wait for me right here. "The magic crane disappears with the flying cloud." "The miraculous needles shine under the moon." Pak Wan Fai, if you are human being, come and bow in front of mom's spirit tablet quickly. You tempted me to here, so you'd tell me who you are now. I am Butterfly Lam. Butterfly Lam? He didn't tell you my name. He is really too kind to you! Twenty-five years ago, Lam Hoi Ping wanted to save you, the princess of a falling empire. So he dumped me and my mother. In these twenty-five years, we suffered so much, and searched everywhere. All we want is to get this heartless crane rider. My master? Your dad? A falling empire? What empire? Who am I? Who are you? How pitiful! You are as pure as a white paper! In these twenty-five years, you are empty! Fine, if your family was broken because of me, I will nod and bow three times in front of your mom's grave. Not that easy! Don't you think the bows can justify the hatred of twenty-five years? That's too easy. I want you to repay what you owed me now! What'll we do? Listen to my song. Then, take the tortoise's gall to get your fame. Just so simple? So, you play it. That's not the way. Pak Wan Fai, stop listening, I've got the tortoise gall. How dare you? Miss. Watch out for her sound wave. Let's go to Kau Chow Fu now. Yuen Yuk, go back to look for my master. Miss, you are severely hurt! Don't let others know it. Miss. Master of Tien Lung Tribe arrives. Watch out for Tien Lung Tribe. Lovely ladies... Don't panic, my arrival is to invite Miss Butterfly Lam to visit the nine schools of martial arts. The crane rider has been hurt by me. You will be the leader of the world of martial arts for sure. Miss Lam, from your voice, you seem to be sick. Aren't you? My master is going to get changed, please leave. You pervert! Miss Lam, let's play together. I am not interesting to the nine schools of martial arts. So I am not going to Kau Chou Fu. How about Pak Wan Fai? I've checked that she's now in Kau Chou Fu, so I come to invite you. Why are you so worried? Aren't you really hurt? If you have guts, come and try! Usually, "To try you" means that kind of thing! How dare you! Shit, my Kung-fu... "Killing Whirlwind Sword." To me, it's just small trick, don't you feel shame? Our madam won't pay any attention to it. I think, Miss Lam is alright. If Pak Wan Fai is now in Kau Chou Fu, I will go with you. Miss Lam, please go in the sedan chair. Miss, I am sorry! I am afraid I can't be able to satisfy your will together. Don't cry! After my dad dumped my mom and me, I swear I will never cry again. "The magic crane disappears with the flying cloud." "The miraculous needles shine under the moon." Reverend, you're sweating. You said your student is going to get the antidote from an angel. Why hasn't he come back yet? He lied! Other than us, who else is that powerful in this world? Your student won't come back! Take a good rest. I did see him riding the big bird with the angel. My student won't cheat me. Go now, if my student doesn't come back, they will go against you. I haven't finished yet, you are not deeply poisoned. Take this angel's leaf, this can heal your pain. Try, put it under your tongue, you will know it. I won't cheat youl! Now, all our students are gathered here. And our masters are all poisoned. If we, the juniors, are united, the world of martial arts will be ours. Not that easy, right? Can we tackle Tien Lung Tribe if we join our force together? No matter how, kill the old men first. Then, negotiate with the Tien Lung Tribe. We work for money only. If the negotiation fails, it doesn't matter, we have over thousands of students here. We have nearly forgotten the Tein Chong School. Yat Yeung Tze, why not join us? What a world! Evils everywhere. I prefer joining the Tien Lung Tribe. You should know how the wind blows! Master. Yat Yeung Tze wants to harm all masters to get the leadership. Masters, don't be used. Tsao Hung? Yat Yeung Tze, thank you for saving me. I will support you to be the leader of the world of martial arts. Chin Man Kwun. Have my order, go in town and declare war to the Tien Lung Tribe. Catch all the students of the nine schools. Kill whoever counter attacks. Yes! -Tsao Hung. -Yat Yeung Tze. Reverend! I can't imagine it's you who betrayed us. Attack! Damn you! Tsao Hung, I saved your life, but how dare you trap me? Yat Yeung Tze, don't be afraid. What's up? Watch out! Don't ruin the world of martial arts. Master. He is the master of Tein Chong School. Kwun Mo, why don't you come back earlier? It's a mess! Master, this is the crane rider. I didn't mean to shout for bluffing you, after a severe fight over nights, under a messy situation, finally we have got the tortoise gall to save the school masters. That's great. But the atmosphere is strange here. You have fought for three days and nights? No! Cut the crap. Most important of all, I've invited this great Kung-fu master to cure the schools' masters. Bravo! What's the matter? Be careful of Tsao Hung! He is so cunning! He almost dragged me to death. Pak Wan Fai. It's fine, let me persuade her. How are you? I was hurt by Butterfly's sound wave stance. If you want to save them, first cure my inner injury first. Don't they know you're hurt? Nevermind! Turn to page ten. So muddy? This book again? What is it? No hurry... Let's do it before they take any action. If the masters are cured, we cannot do anything. Do you wanna rob my tortoise gall? Yat Yeung Tze wants to rob the tortoise gall! Press my nerve point, forget about them. Give it to me...it's hot. Stop robbing! How lucky! God bless you. Stop robbing. Up there! Get the pot first. Come down. Tsao Hung, this is for you. You are hit! It's hot! Yat Yeung Tze, don't mess up! Tien Lung Tribe? Tien Lung Tribe? All of you are here. Why are you holding a pot? Don't let others know we're not getting along well among ourselves. So Pang Hoi, the nine schools come from different parts of China. They cook different kinds of dishes. It's a chance for us to share the experience of cooking. Really? But why are you holding the swords? For we have to protect ourselves from the bastard like you. Yat Yeung Tze, your food seems to be ready. I want a share. Stop dreaming! You won't have a share. Treat him the "Buddha jumps over the wall". Present the dish. Butterfly Lam? She is hurt too. Cure me first. The nine schools can't defeat So Pang Hoi. Another kind of sound wave stance, close your ears to avoid damage. Pak Wan Fai? Kwun Mo! It's a mess, why do you hide here without helping? Shut up, master. Pak Wan Fai is hurt, we can't let others know it. I play her flute to cheat the people outside there. So as to let her cure herself. Let me play the flute, you cure her. Can you play it? Of course, you can play, I can play too. Master. -Let's go on... -Do you want to cure yourself? She is hurt. "Get the essence from the different sex." Wrong. "The Sacred Text"! You bastard! The Fire Tortoise's gall? "Unlimited South Sea, changing universe." What's up? Master. Lam Hoi Ping? Pak Wan Fai, follow me. You have dropped a book. Chase. Kwun Mo, go now. Lam Hoi Ping. Master, do you have a daughter called Butterfly? Butterfly? You are hurt, but you didn't admit. Now, you suffered! Let me kiss you. Follow me. What are you doing? I don't want you to save me. Butterfly. I think, it is a piece of bad land ahead. We have no place to hide up! Where are we now? Don't you think I'm an angel? It's so foggy, how do I know our position! Catch those from Tein Chong School. Take back "The Sacred Text". Yes. The horses are energetic, they must have changed their horses. We have to change our horses too. Let's exchange ours. Shit! It's foggy. We don't know where we are going to! They are disgusting, they have tailed for one whole day! Our horses are exhausted. We will be caught up sooner or later. Master, what'll we do with this book? Tear it into two halves. Not in this way. You'd voice out first! What's the difference? Whoever picks it up, he won't know it's "The Sacred Text". Give it to me, let's go separately. Master, where are we going to meet? See you in Tein Chong Mountain. Don't hide up because you owe me money! Master... take care. Run faster! It's alright. The Text! "The Sacred Text"? It's over? Not funny at all! An eye for an eye. An eye for an eye. An eye for an eye. Are you the king of hell or a ghost? Why am I here? If I were a ghost, I would be a nasty ghost coming to take revenge. I heard you were up there, so I sucked you here. You have smooth skin. A young man. Nice body. I am a general, I wanna arrest you. I stayed here for so many years, I eat those insects and animals only. I haven't tasted the human flesh for a long time. Today, I have got a human. And a courtier. A monster! But you have to look for your enemy. You have great Kung-fu, who are you? You must be trapped by your enemy. Like you, I was conspired by others and was locked here. If my death will make you happy, I prefer being killed by you. What a pity that I am not your enemy. Your enermy is now having wonderful life in the world of martial arts. I am the reverend of Tai Kok Temple of Ki Lin Mountain. I am great in Kung-fu, but I trusted others easily. My first student Lin Hung wanted to learn my Kung-fu, he chopped off my legs, and made me blind. He pushed me to tell him the secret of my Kung-fu. I didn't do so. That's why he trapped me inside this dried well. Master, I will take you out to take revenge. You are lying. -l am not. I won't trust you. How will you trust me? Eat the mud in front of you. Hurry up. Hurry up. A big mouthful! Isn't it delicious? Yes, itis. You are obedient. Do you want to take revenge for me? OK, I trust you. I will move your bones for you. You must hate me so much. I want you to hate everybody. Why should I suffer here? Mom! Mom! Lam Hoi Ping? I want to take revenge for my mother! Your Highness. Why didn't you search for your family? Our city was captured. I rushed into the palace, there were two babies in the bed. I was holding the weapon to make my way. I could save one only. I wished you didn't save me. So, Butterfly wouldn't have wandered for twenty more years. How can I compensate for her? I deserve being killed. Master. But I was selfish. In fact, I just wanted to save my daughter from the fire. Please forgive me. Master, you'd better search for Butterfly. Don't let her wander anymore. I don't want her to be like me. With empty memory. With empty memory. Your Highness, let me cure you first. Master. Take it to save Butterfly. Butterfly, don't move. I am curing you with the miraculous needles. Lam Hoi Ping, I won't let you cure me. Butterfly! Don't move! Some of your nerve points haven't been through. Or you will never get well. Stop your crocodile tears. Butterfly, don't move. Don't do that, otherwise, my Kung-fu will ruin you instead of cure you. I wished to save you instead of the princess. But I saved the princess. My inloyalty made me fail to be a good father. You lied! I want to ruin your effort. I want a revenge. Do you want to kill Pak Wan Fai? Yuen Yuk, don't! Butterfly. Up there! Dad. I want a revenge. What is this? Isn't it the book of Kung-fu? It's a map. You are lying. You were kicked down because of this text, right? No! Master. No? If not, eat this. Come on! After eating this, you can never learn the Kung-fu of it! What's the matter? Are you poisoned? Don't panic, I come to save you. Student...how are you? How are you? Now my power is enriched. What do you want? Tsao Hung, I am your master. You haven't got my Kung-fu and you wanted to confront me? I needn't you to teach me now. You promised to take revenge for me. To take revenge for you? They made a dead set at you and you wanted to take revenge, how about if you make a dead set at me? I should take the revenge first. I won't help you to take revenge. I want you to die with regret! You betrayer! Yuen Yuk, you are hurt too, you can't take me back. Take this letter written in blood... to Pak Wan Fai. Go, hurry up. Your Highness, I'm avenged because of many crimes I've committed. I can't protect you and resume our country, I deserve dying. My daughter Butterfly is going to hurt you. Your Highness should try your best to stop her. Don't sacrifice yourself but you'd stop her from a big mistake. Yours faithfully, Lam Hoi Ping, before dying. Father. Empty memory in these twenty-five years! Why is there hatred between us? I have to end the hatred then. It's not necessary to hold any congregation. Your masters are all dead. The nine schools will go under my Tien Lung Tribe. Those who follow me... Speak up. Speak. The leader of the world of martial arts... Louder. The leader of the world of martial arts. Kau Chou Fu is now the territory of my Tien Lung Tribe. Ask all the shops here, to hang my flag and pay me tax. If anyone dares not open the shop, I will take over it. Whoever wants to trade, they should hang my flag. How long will it stand? Who cares, just take it easy. Don't be lazy, hang it out. We have lots of cloth for drying. I know it. Where is Pak Wan Fai? I have asked Master to return to Tein Chong Mountain. See which shop hasn't shown the flag of Tien Lung Tribe. It's not easy to ask Kwun Mo back to Tein Chong Mountain. He will be bullied for I am not around him. Be frank, I am not mean at all. I have taken him a tael, show him the flag for haning. Lady Jade Flute. Tsao Hung? No one dares to touch you? Do you dare? Yes! This is the "Cheerful Drugs". Try. Please Master? Why are you here? Why are you here? Don't ask why. Haven't you returned to Tein Chong Mountain? You'd better go back to Tein Chong Mountain too! I am busy. Me too! See you in Tein Chong Mountain. See you in Tein Chong Mountain. Master...Tsao Hung... Brother... Tsao Hung, you son of a bitch! I won't give you any face. In front of the Leader of the world of martial arts, how dare you... Shit! Leader of the world of martial arts? Kill him! Yes. How dare you touch my sister? I am now showing you how. She has taken her "Cheerful Drugs". If no man makes love with her, she will die. Tsao Hung. I want it, give it to me... -Save me. -How? Make love with me... Alright. Lam Hoi Ping? I can't imagine a great hero will be buried here. Right. I have to return the book to its master. This book can't be returned to Pak Wan Fai. Take this for your grave! Sudden rain. The flute of Pak Wan Fai? Tsao Hung? It's you who seduced me with Pak's flute? Right. Nonsense. Lam, this is the "Cheerful Drugs" of Lady Jade Flute. If you generate your power, the drugs will be effective quickly. Drag her out. Yes. "All return to normal, the earth links up the north and south." "The Legendary Flash Step." It's over. Miss Lam. Puzzled eyes? "Cheerful Drugs"! Miss Lam... Miss Lam. Chun Ngor. The spirit tablet of mom. Mom! I have punished the heartless man. And Pak Wan Fai. Lam... Your face is so red. Go now. How can I leave right now? If I leave, who is going to save you? You bastard. I wanna kill you. Do you want to kill me? Miss Lam, take a rest. Don't! Why do you want to suicide? I said I'd save you, so I keep my promise. You... Ma Kwun Mo, I want you to save me. Miss Lam, it's useless for you to kiss me like this. I have read a book. It was written that when we do this, we should... Undress first, then touch each other... Miss Lam. A spirit tablet which carries the hatred of twenty-five years. Is now being thrown aside by you. If you are human, you'd kneel in front of the tablet to apologise. OK. Don't be impulsive. You should be happy, for you have got everything you want. Even your dad is killed by you. Pak Wan Fai. Don't do that! Now, your oaths taken before this spirit tablet have all come true. You don't need this spirit tablet again! Take it back. Butterfly, what your dad owed you was compensated. But what I owed him can never be compensated. It's all because of you. To thank him for raising me up, I want to have a duel with you in Kau Chou Fu three days later. Miss Lam, do you mean it? She is like me of the past. Don't stand on my side because we have slept once together. Thank you for saving me. From now on, we don't owe each other. If we have... What you've left inside my body'd be squeezed out by my Kung-fu! We won't have kids. So powerful? It's finished. The third party is hurt! Sir, we have got the message from the informer that, Pak Wan Fai and Butterfly'll have a duel in Kau Chou Fu three days later. Now, many people are leaving the town. They want to escape from their sound wave stance. It's all within my expectation. Their sound-wave stances are damaging. I will use this Bell to conquer. Tsao Hung must have a plot. Butterfly... Don't fight with Pak Wan Fai. Tsao Hung wants to attack you during the duel. Can you listen to me? Where are you taking me to? Damn you crane! Pak Wan Fai, don't fight with Miss Lam. The tornado is coming. Pak, the power of your sound wave is weakened by the tornado. Lam, during this duel, I have to fight with you, and I have to fight with the weather too. Let's settle the hatred of these twenty-five years. The Tornado! Let's see who is faster! Butterfly Lam, you didn't counter attack, is it because you felt guilty of killing your dad? I pity on you. You always owe others in your life. You owed my mom and me, now you owe your master. Re-pay now! Go ahead! Don't let others save you in your next life, or you'll owe others for life. Nothing will be owed for life! I will die with you. You shouldn't mention the history. Who is more powerful, who is the master. You should look forward, don't look back. Now, just my voice is left! Ma Kwun Mo. Go to hell. You can't make it. You can't make it! I can't stand helping anymore! I am the supreme hero! How lucky are youl! I will play with them after fixing you. Go to hell. Come and play with me! I have freezed your nerve point. You are mine. The flute playing is horrible. Make it nice! Master. Butterfly, stop the duel now. Lam Hoi Ping is still alive. Well, go to hell now! Are you alright? Come over here. Lam Hoi Ping, I am going to kill them now. Unless you drop the flute. I know you've been guilty for twenty-five years for saving any of them. Now, I am giving you another chance. If you can save any of them, Who are you going to save? He is so powerful, think something. Today, it's a great test for us. How to defeat this evil? Lam Hoi Ping, drop it or not? You first. Your turn now. -Dad. -Master! How are you? You want to save both. So, it's destiny that you are going to die. Kwun Mo, I am afraid I have no chance to return you the debt. Master... it doesn't matter. Most important of all is your safety. I will ruin your hand, so let's see how can you ring the bell! Stop dreaming! Master. Damn it! I wanna kill all of you. It's blocked, come out quickly. Throw it to them. Catch it. Come out, or I'll tear it. You deserve it! I wanna die with you. Come over here! Pak Wan Fai... "Look up in the sky." "With some arrogance." "The cloud can never block my way." "To fly higher than the magic crane." "Forget all the hatred and love." "And remove the mist and fog." "To go round the world." "Let's embrace in our heart." "Care nothing about the world." "Let's follow the fatal way." "In this world, just you and me are left." "I walk along the way with my best companion." "To watch your smile." "I love your true heart and arrogance." "Let's walk together on the cloud." "Get rid of all the evils." Pak Wan Fai. I am sorry Butterfly. I don't know how to make the choice. If you saved me twenty-five years ago, you would have regretted today. Let bygones be bygones. It's useless to think too much. Go and search for Pak Wan Fai now. You do agree she hasn't died yet? Yes. If I get Pak Wan Fai, I will come to you with her. You mean, to marry me together with her? You mean it? I think you mean it. We are good at Kung-fu. If there is a fight, can you handle it? It depends. OK, see you in Tein Chong Mountain. Deal! Her scent is still left behind. Master... Don't be so sad. Your old virginity will be lost sooner or later. Come on, let's go back to Tein Chong Mountain. I couldn't help following her. We should go this way. Master. Now we're holding such a big flag, we needn't be afraid of robbery. I know what business we are going to do. Let's sell the flags. Of course! The schools rise and fall, they need to change the flags so much. -Along the road of Yang Gate, -How is it? All the flags are sold by us. That's wonderful. So, we'll make big fortune.
