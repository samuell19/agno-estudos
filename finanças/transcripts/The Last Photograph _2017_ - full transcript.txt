God, I hope we get there on time. Yeah. It's all right, I can always catch the next one if I miss it. I guess you can, I know, but it's like Murphy's Law. What's Murphy's Law? Murphy's Law, it's like Sod's Law. Like, anything bad that can happen will happen. And, exactly. Right. I wonder who Murphy is? He's probably Irish. Probably an Irishman. Yeah, he's... Yeah. Or who Sod is, for that matter. I always thought it was 'cause, if anything bad that could happen is gonna happen. It will happen. Right, it will happen. Then he's a poor sod, 'cause he's really unlucky. I see. Yeah, I know, but the name Sod has gotta, I mean, the poor, I, it doesn't matter. So, what's this girl like? I should have known this was coming. I don't know. Well, what's the color of her hair? - Brown. - Brown. And what does she study? She studies English. English literature? Yeah. And what do you talk about? Dad, I don't wanna... I don't wanna talk about this with you, I'm sorry. Do you have long conversations into the night? - No. - No? Actually, yeah, we kind of do. - You do? - Yeah. Yeah. You want one? No, thanks, but do you realize how many wrappers are on the floor? Sorry. Where else am I gonna put them? I don't know, but, I mean, there's basically an entire, sort of, mound of mint wrapper. There's... Or toffees, what are they, toffees or mints? No, they're mints and, okay, yeah, there are quite a lot down there. Sorry. I don't know where else I... Okay, it's all right. - Sorry. - That's okay, it's fine. Morning, love. Got any change at all? Any change, mate? Thank you, see you another day. Hey, Rich. I'm not Rich. Same time tomorrow. Are you a saver or a spender? I'm a saver. I'm sorry, sir, you can't sit here. Did you see that? He's an asshole. Yeah, he's an asshole. So, the big question today is, is Plato right? His quote, "Only the dead have seen the end of war." Well, this quote appears... - Christ. - Did I startle you, Tommy? - Yes. - Good. Nobody ever calls me Tommy, all right? Really? Will you please keep that open? Can I ask you something? What? What's wrong with you? - What's wrong with me? - What's wrong with you? Because every morning you move my table out of its position, and it may seem important to you, but it's... - It is. - Meaningless. And it makes you look crazy and it's beginning to wind me up and, actually, no, fucking annoy me. But this is my side of the bookshop and the tables cannot be there, and I don't want customers leaving their shit! Do you know what you look, you look crazy. Forgive me, okay? I'm sorry. What did you just say? Nothing. Just don't do it again. And I'm serious, you know, there is something very wrong with you. And just get the door fixed! So tell me more about this girl. Come on, tell me, just give me a little something. Okay. I told you how we met, right? Yeah, no. - I didn't? - No, well, not really. You told me she was American. Yeah. So... So you know that thing I went to? It was like, you know, the art thing, the art installation. - Yes. - Yeah, so, it was there. Well, I think I told you that. Anyway, I saw her there and I tried to go up to talk to her, and then when I tried, I turned around and she'd gone. So, I started looking for her, like a bit of a maniac. And then just as I was about to give up, I run out these doors and she's sat there, outside on her own, and I had to pretend like I didn't even know who she was or what she was doing, or that I wasn't looking for her and I was just taking some fresh air or whatever. And I kind of stood there for, like, a good minute or so not saying anything. And then she said, I think she said something like... What are you staring at? And I didn't know what to say, so I said, "You." And she said... God, I'm trying to remember. It is one of Plato's dialogues or actually find it in one of Plato's dialogues... And we'll be very happy to add his or her name to the credits at the end of the program. Please don't touch that. 10:45 and so we continue our discussion on the Crusades. Here today to discuss what were the Crusades... If you need any help, just let me know. What's this? A book. We can see that, but what sort of book is it? Le Carre, Smiley's People, Cold War thriller. So boring. Boring it is not. That's okay. Poor old drunk Dylan Thomas. - Sorry. Oh. Can I have some sweets, Mom? Sure. Please don't touch the sweets with your hands. Here, there's scooper. Here, hold... Oh! So sorry. I'm... Good Ol' Blue Eyes. Let's get out of here. Oh! - Oh, careful. We don't want any accidents, do we? No, we don't. A total of 300,000 Christians died during the march led by Peter the Hermit. While the military campaign was a success the behavior of the Christian army certainly did not win them any new converts. Crusaders were attacking Antioch. They used the heads of slain Turks as ammunition for their primitive cannons. Apart from using the heads as ammunition, about 300 heads were placed on stakes in front of the city to demoralize the defenders of the city. They were digging up corpses for their own consumption... Shit. Shit! Even those who had paid the Christian leader... - What's up? - They stole my bag. - What? - I've been robbed! No. What are you staring at? You. Why? You look so bored. Can I? What's your name? Luke. Hello, Luke. I'm Kate. Hello, Kate. Can I kiss you? Wow. You don't waste time, do you? You're either gonna love this or you're gonna hate this, I'm not sure, so she said, "Okay, yeah, my name's Kate." I said, "Well, I'm not gonna call you Kate." I said, I'm gonna call you Bird. And she said, "Why?" - Why? And I said, 'cause when you move your eyelashes, they're like the wings of a hummingbird. Hey, that's a pretty good line. It's pretty good, isn't it? It's a pretty good line. It depends a little bit of you deliver it, but that's a good line. Yeah, yeah, well, I think she liked it. And then from then on it was Bird. - Huh. - Yeah. Thanks for your help. Ooh, shall I call the police or something? Yes, call the police. Yeah. Yeah, I just wanna report a robbery. Yeah, Chelsea Farmers Market. The Book Pavilion. Yeah, it was a few minutes ago. Hello? Coming? Yeah, yeah, I think so. I didn't know you smoke. Well, I do now. So, Mr. Hammond, the... Mr. Hammond. - Yes. Probably not a good time to ask but was my money in the bag? Yes, all of it, every last penny. Oh, man. Well, that's not good, is it? Just a few more questions. Hope you don't mind. - No, 'course. - No, no, not at all. I was actually talking to Mr. Hammond. - Yes. - Yeah, right. I'll come back. I'll come back when things calm down. Yes, I'm sure you will. Okay. What was in the bag, sir? Tommy? Oh, sorry, am I interrupting? Sorry, you are? I own that restaurant, I'm a friend. Rather, I know Mr. Hammond. If I may continue. Certainly. The bag, sir. 500 pounds in cash for the damn plumber. Book. Yesterday's paper. My keys. But I have an extra set. And... A photograph. Photograph? Yes, a Polaroid. You okay? Yeah. No. I'm gonna miss you. Why don't you just join me? Come out for Christmas. - To New York? - No, Madagascar. Of course New York. It's not far. It's just across the Atlantic, you know? Yeah, it's just... It's Christmas and I don't like leaving my dad. But if I ask him, I know he'll say yes. What are the chances that you might find it? The bag? Yes. Well, no, the photograph. It will be difficult. Thieves are only interested in the cash. See, the rest the stuff they throw away. Yes. Okay. You okay? Sorry, one more thing. The photograph, what was it of? - Of? - Yes, it may help. Oh, that's not fair. It didn't make the sound. - Sorry, I... - Oh, sorry. Hang on, hang on. I've got a good joke. - Uh-oh. - Oh! Okay, what does a frog do when his car breaks down? He gets it toad away. Sorry. It's terrible. Somebody actually gets paid to write those. Oh, gosh, my earring, ah. - Here you go. - My hat. You have your mocks after Christmas? Yeah, I've got mocks in January, and then, yeah. I have to say, your son is very handsome. Yes, he takes after his mother. And where's she? She's no longer with us. I'm very sorry to hear that. So, do you have plans for Christmas Day? Sorry, it sounds like I'm interrogating you. No. I have the habit of being overfamiliar. Well, Luke is going to New York and I'm staying here. New York, why? He's fallen in love. First love. Ah, how exciting. Yeah. Do you have to do coursework? - Yeah, for English, yeah. - Right. I think the key is to live in the present. To the present. Well, yeah, and the half of it is... Tom. Do you still have the balls? Girls, would you like to play... - I'm intrigued. - Balls? Can't say no. Depends whose balls they are. Then we shall go to the balls. Let's play balls. Knock, knock. Hello, Tom. Hey, Mark. Would you be kind as to take care of the shop for a few minutes? I'm supposed to be picking up Maryam. Yeah, well, I'll be right back. Be right back. Tom! - Hello. - Hello. - I'm Mark. - I'm Hannah. I'm his best friend, you'd never guess. Haven't seen him in six months and off he goes, cheeky bastard. - Yeah. I'm sorry, I'm late to meet my brother. - He's a shaman. - Oh, come on. - I can feel it. - He's about to explode. Oh, yeah. Here we go. Here we go! Bringing down the gods of bingo. What on earth are you doing, Mark? Is that what he's like in bed? Play up, play up, and play the game. We're ready. Two little ducks, 22. Quack, quack. That's my birthday, 22nd of July. Quackety-quack. Lucky for some, number seven. Oh, yes. That's not on your card. Mind your own business. Are you cheating? I am not cheating. - She is. - Top of the Pops, number one. Pops, number one, no. One moment, please. Me and you, number two. Ah. Honestly. All the sixes, clickety-click, 66. Bingo. - What? - Bingo! Bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo, yes! You have broken your duck. Yes, finally. Told you it'd happen. Finally, right. Wait, wait, wait, no, Dad, come on, let's, come stand next to me, let's get one together. - Okay. - Come on. You ready? There you go. Bravo. Oh, yeah. Oh, naughty man, Mark. I've got to do better this time. More balls! More balls! More balls! There were three fat men walking down the street with one umbrella, how many got wet? Don't know. None, it wasn't raining. Excuse me. You haven't seen anybody in a red coat? A red raincoat. Blonde hair. Sorry. No. Are you all right? Yeah, yeah, fine. Good evening. Oh, dear. Thank you, ooh, for a wonderful dinner. And have a marvelous Christmas. You're welcome. Take care. Is he okay? No, I know him. He got robbed. Merry Christmas, Luke. - Bye, Merry Christmas. - Bye, darling. - Have a wonderful time. - Thank you. Bye! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, dear boy. - Good to see you. - Great evening. - Merry Christmas. - Thank you for coming. Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! - Bye. - Bye. - Bye! I'm very proud of you. What for, for winning the bingo? No, for being you. Don't forget you're driving me to the airport tomorrow. I won't forget. Okay. I'll get your Christmas present. Thank you. Excuse me. Give me that. - What? - Give me that photograph. What the hell are you doing? - Give it to me! - Get off! - Man, what are you doing? - Give me that photograph. Let go of her! You were in my bookshop, you stole my photograph. Now give it me! I have never seen you before in life. Give it to me, give it to me! Give it to me! Come on, it's of me and my son. Please, give it to me. What, do you want it? Who is that, then? Your son? Tom. Don't! Yeah, go on, take him away. Yeah, don't come back, yeah? - Fuck off! - Hey! What are you all staring at? Huh? There may have been Americans. We're sending a number of inspectors from our Pan Am certificate office, here in New York. International transportation Safety Board is putting together a team, as well, to go over there, so that would be indication that Americans would be on board. We have no confirmation... Have you forsaken me? I said, you've fucking forsaken me! Are you all right? I'm sorry, Father. If you need to talk... It was just a theft. What theft? A random act of theft sent me for tailspin. I feel like I'm on the edge of the... I'm listening. Dad. Yeah. Will you promise me something? Sure. What? You know that bookshop you always said you'd open? Yeah. Well, why don't you do it? Do what? Well, in the New Year, why don't you leave your job in the city and do it? What's gotten into you? I don't know, but you seem so unhappy. Well, everybody's unhappy in their jobs. - Really? - Yeah, really. And you'll learn that in time. Okay, I'll promise, I promise that I'll look into it. - You will? - I'll look into it. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Okay? - Okay. - Happy? - Yes. Good. All right, don't forget to call me, all right? I know you're gonna be in a whole lovey-dovey kind of mood, but don't forget to... - Shut up. Will you please call me when you get there? Yes, okay, I will. - Have fun. - Thank you. I will. And if you open the bookshop... Yeah? On the weekends I would work there for free. Actually, no, I wouldn't work there for free. I would want something, but I'd help you out. So you wouldn't even have to get an assistant. Oh, thank you. Thank you for working for something. Hey, it'd be cheaper than paying someone else. Oh, Mark. I'm so sorry, it took longer than I anticipated. Is everything all right, Tom? Oh, yes, yes, everything's fine, yeah. I'll get you some cigars. I don't want a fucking cigar. I wanna see more of you. Are you okay? - Yes, yes, I'm fine. Here you go. Listen, Tom, I'm sorry. It's just, I've left Maryam waiting at the station for two hours. It's fine, I understand. Oh, you've some money, you made a sale. Oh, how about that? Oh, and one last thing. Yes. The nicely upholstered woman next door that smells like the Garden of Eden, she's left her home address. She came back with her brother shortly after you left. Oh, well, that won't happen. I think you should go, it will do you the world of good. Please send my love to Maryam. Yeah, of course I will. Thanks for the cigars. Yeah. What did you and Mom used to talk about? We used to laugh a lot. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. What did you laugh about? Well, we didn't talk about much is all I can say. We used to laugh. It's kind of the same for us, actually. - Is it? - Yeah. I used to laugh about how her toes used to twiddle. Right. - And... - Okay. I used to put the top of the laundry basket on my head and pretend I was Japanese. That's not even funny. Silly things, like, really silly things. And sometimes we talked about more meaningful things. Like what? About the universe. We used to love looking at the stars. About the immensity and insignificance of us in the scale of things. We kind of do that, as well. - You do? - Yeah, I think so. So, this is Buddha. He is the chief of Buddhism. Yeah. And... You know so much about this. - I do. - It's amazing. He has impressive powers for self-healing and meditation. Have you ever meditated? - Huh? - Okay, sit down. Okay. Fine, okay. No, no, cross-legged. - Right. And you do this with both hands. - Okay. - Yeah. One here. Yeah. - I'm not very, okay. Okay. Follow me. - Okay. - And you go, - Yes? - You can't park here. I'm not parking. Dad, my ticket. Yeah. Oh, shit. Oh, here it is. Thanks, have you checked the date? Of course I've checked the date. What? Oh, very funny. - Kidding. Get out of here. See you. - See you. - Bye. Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke. - Yeah? - Your Christmas present. - What? - Here. It's your sweater. I'll get it when I get back, okay? Promise, thank you. - All right. - I love you. Love you. Hello? Hannah, hi, it's Tom. I came to apologize. Hannah? Hannah, Hannah, are you listening? Please say something. Hannah. Nice place. Sorry, what did you say? I said, that was not me today. Oh, so who was it, then? Somebody else. Please, I need to explain. Do you realize how many good guys you killed this week? How many judges does it take to prosecute a cop? A Pan Am 747 jumbo jet with 255 people on board has crashed just north of the Scottish border. There's an emergency telephone number in America. It's 0101-212-880-1234. Pan Am flight, PA103, took off from London Heathrow bound for John F. Kennedy Airport in New York at 6:25 this evening. Radar contact was lost at 7:19. The plane came down in the town of Lockerbie in Dumfriesshire. It crashed into a petrol station and a number of houses. Eye witnesses report a huge explosion and a 300-foot fireball. There were 240 passengers and 15 crew on board. We've just had this from America. There may have been Americans. We are sending a number of inspectors from our Pan Am certificate office here in New York, and the International Transportation Safety Board is putting together a team, as well, to go over there. That would be an indication that Americans would be on board. We have no confirmation, no numbers of injuries or fatalities at this time. Why don't you just join me? Dad, I'm going to New York and it's gonna be fine. - Okay. You don't need to worry about me. It's just... It's Christmas and I don't like leaving my dad. Obviously you're preparing for a long night? We certainly are, yes. Sadly, we are. What number should people ring? Anyone who wants to know anything about anyone on the flight? Do you have plans for Christmas Day? Well, Luke is going to New York and I'm staying here. Was there a man dismayed? Theirs not to make reply, theirs not to reason why, theirs but to do and die, into the valley of Death. Rode the... They took away the Christmas tree in the Pan Am departure lounge as anxious relatives began to arrive desperately seeking information. Professionals and volunteers still arriving to man the phones and to comfort relatives until solid information is available. Here, it's your sweater. I'll get it when I get back, okay? Promise, thank you. - Okay, all right. - I love you. Bye. Sorry, sir, you can't go any further forward here. The emergency services mount a major operation, the hospital tends the injured people of Lockerbie. There's nobody injured here at all. There's no one left in the hall at all. Who's been brought in here? There's nobody been brought in here just now, at the moment, everybody's been moved out. If you go up to the community center at the academy, you might find some people up there. They've all been moved up there. The community center up at the academy. Ah, Officer. Can I help you, sir? Yes. I've come to collect my son. He was on the Pan Am flight to New York. Where is it you've come from tonight, sir? I've come from London, from London. Would you follow me, please, sir? I've had an inquiry. This fella's turned up looking for his son. Says he was on the plane. Would you please hurry? Forgive me, I don't know if you understand, but I need to get this to my son. He's very, it's very cold. I understand, sir, take a seat. Let's get something to warm you up. Come on, have a seat. Have a seat. Sir. - Yes? I've got some biscuits. You okay? - Yes. - Come on. I've had enough tea. You see, I've been here for hours and all I want to do is give this to my son. Do you understand? You need to listen to me. I'm listening. There are no survivors. Do you understand me? No survivors. No, I don't understand. Luke? Luke? Help, I need help! It's okay! - Sir, are you okay? - It's okay, sir. - Come on, can you hear me? Just breathe. Just breathe. - Yes, yes. Shh, breathe. You're okay. Okay. It is one of those nights one will never forget. It's clearly been an appalling disaster and all our hearts and our thoughts go out to the large number of people who will undoubtedly have died as a result of this accident. Tragedies of this nature are impossible to predict. It's just a most unfortunate and incredible situation. And we're very, very sorry. How many Americans were on the plane, sir? I can't tell you precisely. I would assume that there were a great many Americans percentage-wise on the plane. Eye witnesses said the shattering force of the collision made it almost impossible anyone could have survived. Searchers found the corpses had been horribly mutilated by the explosion. Broken your duck, Luke. Finally. Wait, wait, wait, no, Dad, come on, let's, come and stand next to me, let's get one together. Ready? White Fang. Shall we get drunk? Oh, yes, yes, very. I'll get it. - No, you sit down, I'll go. Oh, please. There's a bottle of white in the fridge. Uh-huh. And the corkscrew? It's in a basket when you go in on the left. Okay. Hm. Corkscrew, corkscrew? Where's the corkscrew? Was that your brother at the park? What? The man whose shoulder you were leaning on. Was that your brother? Yeah, that's my brother. Huh. Oh. Tom? Yeah. Sorry. Oh, no. - They all fell. - It's all right. He's the most understanding person I've ever known. Oh yeah? And tells the worst jokes in the world. Oh, really, like what? Like, you remind me of the sea. The sea, why? Because you make me sick. Oh, Luke used to tell silly jokes like that. Here you go. I bought him the ticket. He wanted to go. He was in love. He wanted to experience more of it. How were you to know that was going to happen? I have been such a shit to you. Why are you being so kind? Because we share something. And what's that? Pain. Dear Mr. Hammond. I am Kate Louise Pemberton. Or Bird, the name your son gave me. Before you throw this letter away, please read it all. It's taken me several months to put pen to paper, trying to find the right things to say, but the truth is, I'm still not sure what to say. Yes, I am the one who invited your son to New York, and I am the one who was waiting for him at the airport. Bang. I'm sorry. No, you hate me? Okay, fine, that's it. I thought we were gonna spend the rest of our lives together, not just those few short weeks. Love at first sight, as the cliche goes. Luke and I met at a party, and after that, he was the only person I ever wanted to spend my time with. But I am now left with nothing. I have nothing to hold onto but memories of him. I love you. Just like you, I am now confronted with the pain of trying to move on. I love you, too. The truth is, if he hadn't met me, he'd be alive today. I know that. And that is something that I will have to suffer with every day for the rest of my life. For now, and I hope you understand, I wish to mourn alone. Maybe a time will come when I can think back on those precious memories without pain and life can start again. Dearest Bird, if I may, I'm so happy and so sad to hear from you. You say that you don't have the strength to face me. Well, let me tell you that I don't have the strength to face anything anymore. But I've noticed in my grief that what I believe in today, I may not believe in tomorrow. I wanna tell you everything, so please excuse me if I go too far. Luke's funeral was attended only by me and my best friend. I knew that I could not bear to see the anguish on so many young faces, the curling of parents' arms around the shoulders of the young. Perhaps I was being selfish. I'm not sure. I wanted to say to my best friend that perhaps Luke was too beautiful for this world, but instead my head was full of noises, noises that I could not hear. I wanted to put my hands over my ears and scream, but I couldn't. I'm happy that you enjoyed my son for those few short weeks. I watched him grow into a young man. You say that you have nothing of his. Well, the day that Luke was coming to see you, I bought him a blue sweater, something to keep him warm during his trip to New York. But somehow I was never able to give it to him, so I thought that maybe you should have it. If it becomes a burden, throw it away, but it's yours. I understand you well, Bird, and I will let you mourn in peace. I wish I could mourn in peace. And maybe one day, one day, we shall meet. Did you ever meet? I did think of contacting her after 9/11 but she was so young. Hmm. I better be going. Ooh, sorry, I drank your wine. What? Do you know, it's not even that funny, it's just that. It's a little ridiculous, your collar. - Oh. - Look at that, there you go. You need someone in your life. It's too complicated. Oh, is it? Thank you. - Good night. - Good night. I'll see you out. Thanks. We're getting reports today that Dick Cheney is close to achieving from the Libyan government $1 million for families related to the victims of the Lockerbie disaster. The latest in the report is Abdelbaset al-Megrahi has been sentenced to life for his role in the Lockerbie bombings. Compensation for the families of the PA103 victims were among the steps set by the UN for lifting its sanctions against Libya. Other requirements included a formal denunciation of terrorism, which Libya said it had already made. In accepting responsibility for the actions of its officials on the 15th of August, 2003, Libya's UN ambassador, Ahmed Own, submitted a letter to the UN Security Council formally accepting responsibility for the actions in relation to the Lockerbie bombing. The UN canceled the sanctions that have been suspended for four years. The US trade sanctions were lifted. Then Libya offered up to US dollars of 2.7 billion to settle claims by families of the 270 killed in the Lockerbie bombing. What's the color of her hair? - Brown. - Brown. Here, it's your sweater. I'll get it when I get back, okay? Promise, thank you. I love you. Beautiful day, isn't it? Yeah, it is lovely. I love those boats. Mm, they are nice. Wish we could live in one. I do, too. Which one do we want? I like that red one over there. Do you, that used to be a ferry. That would have gone up and down the river. What are those people over there doing? Looking for treasure. Treasure? Mm. A long time ago, a Spanish galleon sank in the river and it was full of gold coins. In the water? In the water, in the mud, but the mud's too deep for the divers, so they send in these big machines to help them search. Wow, can we go and have a look? I think it's a bit dangerous, don't you? I mean, I think we should leave it to the machines. They've got these special tools to help them find things. I'm hungry. Well, let's go somewhere and have our sandwiches. Why can't we have them here? No, it's, I don't want to be late. But they might have found the treasure. They won't, it's a big, big river, one of the biggest in the world. They'll be looking for days. How big is the river? Enormous. How big? At least this big. Is it bigger than the River Nile? No, no, it's not bigger than the River Nile, but it's very, very big. Do you promise we'll come back? Cross my heart. Pinky promise? Pinky promise. Come on. Wonder what sandwiches we've got? Ooh, yeah, I'm looking forward to that. The planes have changed their flight path now. They're coming all the way over there. I wonder what sort of sandwiches we've got. I hope it's... Hannah. Hannah. I found it. You found the photograph? Yes. It's all faded, but I found it. Where? At the riverbank. Oh. I was looking at a father and son, and they were, they were talking, and they reminded me of Luke and I, and the boy looked at me straight in the eyes. It was as if I was being looked at by Luke. And then I found it. My boy. My boy. Yeah, you can't really see anything. It's beautiful. You can't really see anything. But I found it. In a way I... In a way I don't need it any more. Now that I've found it, in a way I don't need it any more. I found it, Hannah. I'm happy for you. I found it. Dear Bird, it has been so long since our last correspondence and I hope this letter finds you well. There have been so many unresolved questions, who to blame. I feel that we will probably never know who the true culprits really are. There's been talk about the Libyan government giving a large compensation, but I see that as blood money. I don't believe anything that anyone says, especially the people that have the power to investigate this heinous crime. As a way to celebrate Luke's brief life, I've decided to return back to Lockerbie for his birthday. It'll be the first time that I've been back since the tragedy. There is a small church that I'm told is close to the approximate location where Luke's body was found, close to a beech tree. I wanna visit this place and somehow I wanted you to know. Sincerely, Tom. Mr. Hammond? Yes. I'm... Oh. You're Bird. You came. Of course. And you're... You're wearing Luke's sweater. I hope that's okay. I wear it when I miss him. You look like him. Oh, Bird. I miss him so much. Mr. Hammond, I am so sorry. Oh, no, no. I... No. Oh, no. Let's go for a walk. Hey, hey. You all right? - Yeah. - You okay? Come on. You've hurt your knee. Oh, yeah. Shit. - Is it all right? Yeah, it's fine. - All right? - Hey.
