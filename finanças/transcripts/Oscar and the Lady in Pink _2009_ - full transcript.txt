- Go on. - Careful! Here he comes! Who did it? Who did it? Who? You, Oscar? Open the curtains. It's ok. Laughing is good. No big deal. I'm just... a bit wet. Let's get to work. Mother of God! I've had enough of these pranks! Who's the idiot? What should I be wary of now? The textbook. What about it? Between the pages. Nothing! Mrs. Gommette? Another naughty child? I'll punish him. It's you. Send him to his room to rest. Good idea. What's wrong? Aren't my jokes funny? Very funny. That's why we don't punish you. But you don't laugh either. How do you feel? Wake up! Wake up! Your parents are here. Impossible, it's Friday. They only come Sundays. There's a red jeep. Come see. See? That's them. What's my reward? Popcorn, we can't feed you. You're here to lose weight. I'm so hungry I ate my suppositories. Mom, Dad! Where are they going? Careful, dammit! Sorry, I didn't see you. Idiot! You wrecked my bag. I didn't see you. Even in this ridiculous suit? I'm pretty visible, for chrissakes! - Dirty mouth. - Some kid! He knocks me down and insults me. Get lost, germ. Before I whack you. Wrong floor. Madam? What? - Why the dirty mouth? - Professional deformation. What's your profession? Lady wrestler. No way! I'll sock you one to prove it! Don't tempt me, I've got itchy fists. Can't hold the door? You don't look ill. What pig taught you manners? - Screw you. - Screw you too, asshole! Prof. Dusseldorf's Ward We've come miles for our son Oscar. We've tried everything. Absolutely everything. I'm sure you have, Doctor. We had high hopes for this new treatment, but alas... You must keep trying. We've been trying for months, with no improvement. Isn't there another treatment? Anything? Not yet. My baby! Does he know? That you're here? No. No, that the transplant didn't take. No. No, and we'll never tell him. Really? Do you feel strong enough to see him? No. Not now, not today. Me neither. Not now. I must insist. Your son needs... Please. Not now. Oscar? Oscar? No, not now. No, not now. No. Me neither. No, not now! No, not now! What were you doing in this ward? Did you see anything? Talk to us, Oscar. We're your friends. What's on your mind? What do you feel? Who will you talk to? I want the Pink Lady. The Pink Lady? I want the Pink Lady. The lady wrestler. Doctor, I think I know. A woman came this morning selling pizza. She was dressed in pink. Do you have her number? Pinky Pizzas, a big slice of love! Have you seen my magic wands? I keep losing things. - Lily, we're waiting. - Coming, Mrs. Gimenez! See her gorgeous daughter? And her cousin. Nice gowns, huh? I'll be a princess someday. Isn't she cute? What are you? A princess, like you. I'm Cinderella, scrubbing away, before Prince Charming. Golden Fairy Studios, hello. Here she is. For you, my girl. Yes, Mrs. Gimenez? Don't touch. Yes? What? This way. I hate hospitals, they freak me out. I only came in the hopes you'd reconsider my pizzas. Of course, we'll discuss it. Professor, your patient is here. In a minute. That dragon lady I spoke to earlier... She didn't even listen, she threw me out. What I wanted to say about my pizza is... See the child first, then we'll talk pizza. The child? What child? I don't remember any kid. What's he got? - Cancer. - Shit. A serious case. We can't do anything. Here we are. I'll leave you with him. Go on in. He's waiting for you. I came to sell pizza. If you want me to consider your pizzas, at least talk to him. Oscar, is this the lady you meant? Go on. I'll leave you to it. Professor, they're waiting. - What've you been up to? - Hanging out in a broom closet. Was it fun? Why don't they open from the inside? Because the brooms and mops would escape. What's your name? Oscar. And yours? Rose. Stupid, huh? Everyone calls me Rosy. I prefer Rose. Do you really wrestle? Would I lie to you? I'd have loved to be a fighter. What do I look like? A Martian, why? I'm not green. Martians aren't all green. You know one? Yeah. A lady wrestler. Crystal from Mars. All fat and muscle, bald as an egg. She wore a green leotard and mask to look like a Martian. She was white like us underneath. 120 kilos of lies and rage. One tough broad. Did you beat her? Always. By a knockout. The last time, they couldn't even bring her around. Nobody laughs anymore. They're afraid of me. Why is that? Maybe because I'm not a good patient. The kind who makes them happy. Gives them faith in medicine. Yet I never complain when it hurts. But you should! I complain all the time, regardless. You gotta squeal like a skunk, let it all out, or you'll get cancer. Too late. Why won't they tell me I'm dying? Why should they, if you already know? Will you visit me? - No parents? - I hate them. Cowards. They ran off when Dr. Dusseldorf told them. They think I'm a coward, too. I never want to see them again. Will you visit me? Please? And tell me about your fights? Will you? Will you come? Please say yes. No! I'm not hanging out with a dying kid. I have no desire! Nobody does, Madam. But it's a fact. He's here, he's sick, he's going to die. God knows why he wants you, he'll talk to no one else. I don't know this kid. I'm no bleeding heart charity type. I've got enough problems of my own. Hospitals smell bad. Illness frightens me. Just saying cancer, I'm afraid I'll catch it! I'm here to push my pizzas. Nothing more. A girl's gotta make a living! You're right. You have to live, and Oscar has to die. Maybe we can strike a deal. Here's what I propose. Deliver us your pizzas everyday, then spend a little time with him. That's not fair. Not fair of me to suggest it, or not fair of you to refuse? You don't look well, sweetie. That's worries, too many worries. Can I sleep over tonight? You know that's what I want, princess. Why can't we live together? I want to make it on my own. I didn't get divorced to become dependent on another man. I'll stay with my mother until I get on my feet. What the hell is this? An old wrestling trophy. - Impressed? - Very. One day I'd like to add you to the shelf. Yeah? My most beautiful victory. Don't even think about it. What's this? A gift from a kid who thought I was a star. He was paralyzed from the waist down, but good with his hands. Poor kid. I wonder if he's still alive. I'll hit the shower. Thank you. I didn't really have a choice. Next week you'll be treating me for depression! Give me that, now! Go to your room. - I won! - What? Chocolate, from Popcorn! He said you wouldn't come. Who's Popcorn? His name is Yves but we call him Popcorn. It suits him. Come see. 98 kilos. A meter tall and a meter wide. Give it back! He only fits into American polo shirts. The stripes look seasick. I brought you this. Cool, a ring! What was your wrestling name? The Riviera Strangler. That was when I was most famous. When I was young I was skinny. Too skinny, like you. Back then, I was the Devilish Dragonfly. And your opponents? Look. Ladies and gentlemen! Give it up for a ferocious warrior who cannot be tamed! The Riviera Strangler! The Riviera Strangler will take on the invincible, unbeatable, Diabolica Lightbreast! Diabolica Lightbreast was a Dutchwoman with bombshells for breasts. - You don't wrestle anymore? - No. I'm too old. You're past it? Will you visit me a lot? Prof. Dusseldorf said I can come everyday. - Just for me? - Yes. - For how long? - Twelve days. Twelve days? Is it that bad? It's December 20th? Unbelievable! What? Where I come from, Oscar, legend has it you can use the last 12 days of the year to predict the following year's weather. You observe the weather. Each day represents a month. Get it? For example, today, the 20th, represents January. Right? So... It'll be fine and dry this coming January. Tomorrow we'll see for February. Day after tomorrow, March... through to New Year's Eve for December of next year. Does it work? It's a legend. The Legend of the 12 Divinatory Days. From today on, you'll live each day like it counts for 10 years. - 10 years? - Yes. One day... 10 years. Another day... 10 years. So in 12 days, I'll be 120? Yes. Amazing, huh? What a life! - I was born this morning? - Yes. It's pretty fuzzy. Being born always is. Today I reached the age of reason. But what I learned wasn't good. You got it: Learning can be sad. - Leaving already? - Yes. I'll be back tomorrow for your teen years. I can't wait. No Ma'am, I only make children's gowns. For young princesses, not old ones. Definitely not for Queen Mothers. Try my new product. Strange idea, your pizza thing. Thanks for the support. I support you. Delicious. But where do you get such ideas? Pizza is so... greasy and stinky. I'm broke and cooking is all I know. That'll be Mrs. Gimenez for her magic wands again. Where'd I put the darn things? Golden Fairy Studios. Yes, here she is. The hospital. For me? Yes? Prof. Dusseldorf? Did the pizza make someone sick? Don't worry, it's nothing like that. I was wondering if Oscar spoke to you. Of course he did. He won't speak to us. We don't know if he's hungry, thirsty or in pain. It's getting hard to care for him. Do you think you could get him to talk? Me? By the way, I wanted to tell you my pizza was delicious. See you tomorrow. - What's up? - Business is picking up. I told you your father's truck would bring luck! Cut the crap, Mom! Dad died 5 years ago. His truck never brought anyone luck. How can you be so foolish? Five and a half years. What? Five and a half years. He died exactly 1,998 days ago. I thought you sucked at math. I do. I suck at mourning, too. Back again today? Just passing by, thought I'd check in. I'm bored. Hi, Oscar. Hi, Brigitte. Want a kiss? No. Want a kiss, Ma'am? Thanks, another time. That means no. Retarded kids are affectionate. So... You're bored? - What if you wrote? - To whom? I hate my parents. My friends are all here. How about me? No, you'd stop coming. How about God? Oh no, not you! Not me what? I didn't think you lied. Why God? My parents tried Santa Claus. You can't fool me twice! Oscar, God and Santa Claus are totally different. Not true. It's the same hogwash. Do you think I... a former wrestler, 160 for 165, with 43 knockouts, believe in Santa Claus? No. I don't. But I do believe in God. You hear me? Loud and clear. Stationery. What do I put? Tell him your thoughts. Your innermost thoughts, the ones that weigh heavy, hold you back, prevent new ideas. You gotta let those stinky old thoughts out. OK. You can ask God one thing per day. Only one! Your God is a loser. The genie gave Aladdin 3 wishes. A wish per day beats 3 in a lifetime. I guess. Can I ask for anything? Toys, candy... - A car? - No, Oscar. God's not Santa. You can only ask for spiritual things. Such as? Courage, patience, clarification. OK, I get it. Or favours for other people. A wish per day? No way. I'm keeping them all. Good idea. I'll be back in an hour. Excuse me, Madam. Where's the hospital? I don't know. I'm not a tourist office. Dear God... Finished? Yeah. What's God's address? Watch out the window and you'll see. Dear God, My name is Oscar. I'm 10. This is my first letter to You. I didn't have time before because of school. You can visit me if You want. I'd like that. I'm open from 6 am to 9 pm. I sleep the rest of the time. If You find me sleeping, wake me up. I'd hate to miss You by a hair. My hat's off to you, Madam. By the way, I make a delicious lemon pie. Meaning? You know what I mean. They cost 10 euros and feed 8. How many would you like? Hello. Be right there. I'm playing chess with Einstein. Hi, Einstein. I'll let you finish. What are you reading? The medical dictionary. My favourite book. You're joking. No. I'm learning all the diseases I might get later. Help! I lost. His real name is Thomas. We don't call him Einstein because he's smarter. It's because his head is so huge. It's filled with water. That's too bad. If it were his brain, he'd go far, Einstein. Look. Sing with your heart Dance with your heart Who do you like here? Einstein, Popcorn, Bacon. - Bacon? - A burn victim. Any girls? Can't hear you. Any girls? - No. - I don't believe you. Peggy Blue. Where is she? She's like a fairy, resting in a hospital. What's wrong with her? Blue disease. Her blood doesn't flow to her lungs correctly. She's waiting for an operation to make her pink. What a shame. I agree. She's pretty in blue. Have you told her? What? Have you seen my noggin? She'd have to like aliens. And I doubt she does. I think you're handsome. I don't want to rely only on my looks. What do you feel for her? - I want to protect her from ghosts. - Are there ghosts here? Come here! Every night the ghosts wake us up, we don't know why. I want to keep the ghosts away from Peggy. Go tell her that. How old are you? What time is it? - Noon! So you're 15. - Already? Yes. Time to face your feelings. Go on. Move it. Go on. You can do it. Hi Peggy. It's Oscar. I want to protect you from the ghosts. Scram, runt. Peggy's off limits. - How so? - I got here first. We're friends, right Peggy? You can have China Girl. Or fight me if you prefer. Loser! What's your name? Sandrine. That's not Chinese. Why do they call you China Girl? Is the treatment working? The doctors are pleased with me. You can kiss me. Why? Isn't the chewing gum enough? Too chicken, runt? To kiss you? Are you kidding? I'm 15. I've kissed a whole slew of girls. Barrels of 'em. You're 15? I've always wanted to kiss a 15-year-old. China Girl's got Oscar! My chewing gum! Give it back! Give it back. Give me that. Hello, Oscar. Who's your friend? She's not my friend! Oscar! Did you come this week? No. Why do you say that? A friend saw your car in the parking lot. There are a lot of cars like ours. Cars are interchangeable. Unlike parents. Unfortunately. I brought you a present. Better than the last one, I hope. It's not my fault the manual was in Japanese. The time before, we wasted the day with the rules. Well, I'm no good at kids' games. You're good at ruining afternoons. So you can listen to music. I put The Nutcrackeron it. Remember? We saw the ballet together. Listening now? Yes. Right now? While we're still here? Do you mind? Do you have something to tell me? No. Do what you like, Oscar. Very nice. Now I'm tired. I'm sleepy. OK. So? We'll be going. Yes. Let's go. I love you, my little Oscar. I love you. You're hurting me. Sorry. I love you so much. I love you so much. I'm sleepy. His letter tells us he knows how serious his condition is. He's angry at your silence. You should try to discuss the subject with him. No. Talk to my son about his death? I know you didn't bring a child into this world to discuss his death with him, but... Doctor, what exactly does he say about us? Nothing in particular, nothing important. "My parents are two whackos, "two total idiots "with no conversation since I've been sick. "I don't want to see them now. I'd rather remember the time when they could say I love you without sorrow." Little tyke. So, how was your day? Zero. With my parents, zero. With Peggy, zero. She's with Popcorn. - She told you? - No, he did. He's bluffing. - No. - Sure he is! Popcorn wants to intimidate you with his size. I was a mouse in the ring, but I beat wrestlers who were whales or hippos. Take Plum Pudding, for example. My Irish rival... And now, ladies and gentlemen, the colossal, inescapable Plum Pudding! Despite technical difficulties, I've just been informed that Plum Pudding is about to descend on our ring! She was so fat she could barely move. She was one big, fat bluff. No need to fight. What'd you do? For starters, I set her head spinning. To throw her off balance. At the last minute, I delivered the death blow. Wrestling teaches us about life. It sure does. You've got small bones, not much meat. But seduction is a matter of the heart. And you've got plenty of heart. Go tell Peggy how you feel. I'm tired. Tired? What age are you now? 18? 18-year-olds don't get tired. Peggy, listen to this music. It's so pretty, it reminds me of you. It's beautiful. Peggy Blue, I don't want you to have the operation. Stay as you are, you're pretty in blue. What? You're pretty in blue. I want you to protect me from the ghosts. You can count on me. Kiss me. You don't chew gum, do you? Dear God, The teen years sure are hard. Puberty is tough. Once is enough. Life's better at 20. My wish for today is, I want Peggy and I to be married. Rose says marriage is a material wish, but see what You can do. I'd appreciate it. Ever told anyone you loved them? Look at you, a strapping lad with huge hands and feet, wanting to hear sweet nothings. Why shouldn't I? I hate anything to do with love, kindness and feelings. It makes me puke. Why? If you say or show too much, it's fake. Sounds like bad memories. Rose! Don't play shrink with me! Sex is all I want from you. Oh yeah? It bothers you if I love you? That's right! Peggy! The ghosts! It's Bacon. I was afraid it was you. And I was afraid it was you. Would you sleep with me? OK. Shall we dance? I'd love to. You little devils! How dare you? You have no right! Who was on guard last night? Claudine, she's gone. Get her back here immediately! This just won't do! Kissing is harmless. Kissing spreads germs. - Give the diabetics their shots. - Right away, Mrs. Gommette. He doesn't deserve it, but... Go see the unhappy creature. Thanks. She called me unhappy, but I'm happy. I'm sure you are. So it's serious with Peggy? Big time. We got married last night. - Married? - Yeah. Who do you take me for? We did everything men and women do when they're married. Oh really? It was amazing. All the stuff I used to think was gross, kissing, caressing... I really enjoyed it. Funny how we change, huh? I'm delighted for you. And it's normal. You're over 20 now, gotta try new experiences. One thing we didn't do. Kiss with our tongues. Why not? Peggy was afraid to have a baby. I see. What do you think? - She's right. - Really? You can have kids by kissing on the mouth? I'll have one with China Girl! No, I was just joking. The Nutcracker! Yeah. It's our music, Peggy and me. Funny. I had a friend called Nutcracker. A real champion! She wanted to be a ballerina, but never could. The guys wouldn't dance with her. - Really? - You bet. Muscles of steel, especially her thighs. She clung to the nostalgia of the tutu. Even in the ring, she thought she was in a ballet, and her opponents were sabotaging her steps. Anyone who stood in her way was quickly ejected... so she could get on with her choreography. She was quite a wrestler. But she didn't realize it. In her mind, she was a prima ballerina. I'm sorry. I've been sleepy lately. Craving sleep. That's only normal. Young adults party hard, then have to sleep it off. Get some rest. Dear God, Please make Peggy Blue's operation go smoothly. Or if that's a material wish, then help Peggy react positively whatever the result. I'm counting on You. How do you feel? Fine. Good. What's happening? They're taking Peggy into surgery. It's hard being 30. It's the age of worries and responsibilities. How dare your God allow this? Such sickness? Unless he's mean. Or incompetent. Oscar, sickness is like death. A fact of life, not a punishment. - You're not sick. - How do you know? You think everything's rosy for Rose? I've never been sick and I won't die? What can I do for you? Want me to adopt you? Adopt me? Yeah. I adopted Bernard when he had the blues. Bernard? My teddy bear. Look at him, poor thing, he's a wreck. He looks like you. I adopted him when my dumb parents gave me a new bear. Like I would accept a new bear! They might as well have replaced me, too. Let me see. We do look alike. I'll give him everything in my will. I can adopt you too, if it's any comfort. Good idea. It would comfort me. Give me five. You can tell me anything. I'm over 30 with cancer and a wife in surgery. I know about life. I'm afraid. Afraid for Peggy? Or for yourself? Just afraid. Afraid? Afraid. Afraid? Shall we go see God? - You know where He lives? - Of course. I'm not allowed out. If you take me out, they won't let you come back. I really don't want that. We'll be sneaky. What's that? Props for the kids' party, to show Mrs. Gommette. Mrs. Gommette? Yeah, she loves a good time. - OK. - Thanks. Well? She hates it. I could've told you. Shame, I liked the leek. Here? That's Him. Oh no! Yes. No way. Rose, you were a wrestler, a great champion! You can't put your trust in that! Why not? He's as scrawny as I am! Would you prefer a beefcake athlete in tight underwear? Who do you feel closer to? A God who feels nothing or a God who suffers? The one who suffers, of course. But if I were God, I'd avoid suffering. No one can avoid suffering. Not God, not you, not me. Take a closer look. Does he look like he's suffering? You're right. He doesn't seem to be. And yet, he's going to die. There are two kinds of pain. Physical pain and mental pain. When someone drives nails through your hands and feet, you can't help but feel pain. But the idea of dying doesn't have to cause suffering. It's up to you. He's not afraid to die and doesn't suffer at the idea. Yeah. But do you know anyone who's happy to die? My grandmother! She smiled with delight on her deathbed. Impatient to see what awaited her. People fear death because they fear the unknown. But that's just it. What is the unknown? Nobody knows. So, Oscar, as you face the unknown, I suggest you banish your fear and have confidence. Like him. What are you doing here with a cake? I just thought... Since it's Christmas soon... it's kind of His birthday, right? Happy birthday... It went well. So... She's still blue. That'll change in a few hours. No. Yes. No. If he says so. Like to meet your parents-in-law? Oscar... Hello. - Hello, Oscar. - Hello. It's cool. What's cool? Peggy's mom isn't blue but she's pretty anyway. Come on, let's go. You can be any colour you like, Peggy. I'll love you the same. Dear God, Today turned out to be a good day. A family day. I adopted Rose, enjoyed my parents-in-law and got my wife back in good health. It's over between us. - Why, Peggy? - You kissed China Girl. I did not! Who told you? And China Girl, too! She was furious you stole her gum. What? She's the one who passed it to me when... I swallowed it whole. So you admit it! Out of my sight. So? Peggy's mad about China Girl, but it was before her. Female jealousy. She can't make me pay for my past all my life. I'll deliver my pizzas, be right back. Come to your room. Hi, Oscar. Hi, Brigitte. Want a kiss? Might as well. She kissed him! She kissed him! I'm telling Peggy. - No, no! - Yes. By the way, I hate you. It's hard being 40, huh? Yeah. I keep screwing up. It's a midlife crisis. Men seduce women to see if they still can. - So I'm normal? - Yes. But I'm an asshole too? Yep, totally normal. Now we need to fix it. - We can't. - Yes we can. - No we can't. - Yes! - No! - Yes! They say I chase skirts but I never leave my room. Remember, there's always a solution. No. Take my fight with Titty Royale. Titty Royale? Titty Royale, a Belgian wrestler. She devoured 3 kilos of raw meat per day, washed down with beer. Titty Royale's secret weapon was her breath, because of the fermenting meat and beer. It knocked her opponents out. What'd you do? Changed characters. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a newcomer to the wrestling world! The Carpentras Executioner! I doused myself in lavender. And I used a nose plug. With wrestling, you need brawn in the brain too. Do what I tell you. Come on. I'll never say that corny stuff. Trust me, Oscar. I know what girls are like. Right, you were a girl once. Excuse me, I still am! Get in there and say what I told you to say. - I'll look silly. - Get in there! Hi, Peggy. I love you and you alone. I love you and you alone. Me too, Oscar. It worked! Get back in there and kiss her. Kissing is a girl thing. Want Popcorn to do it for you? I'm going. Dear God, Marriage is nice, especially as you reach 50. The crises are behind you. No wish tonight, I'll give You a break. Take me away. What's wrong? Look at the calendar. It's Christmas. My parents are coming. It'll be a stupid day. I don't deserve this! What'll Dad give me this time? A puzzle with 18,000 pieces? A box of instructions? Calm down. I'm serious. Danger lurks. Take me with you. No dice. I have to deliver my pizzas. I'll be back. See you later. - Hurry up! - My cap! My ring! Quick! It's locked! Move aside, wimp. I grew up in the projects. How cool! My pizzas! Good luck. Bye. Move it, asshole! You're in my way! What the hell are you doing? Buying property? Want my finger up your other nostril? That idiot's on his phone. You drive too badly to make calls. Yeah? Don't bring anything, Grandma's on top of it. She likes to go all out for her guests. Do you bring sun to Tahiti? You don't get it? No surprise. Just like your dad. You owe me 4,000 euros rent. You could spare her, Mom. She always wins. Only when the money's fake. Did the doorbell ring? I heard something. Really? I'm not expecting anyone. Maybe it's Dad. I doubt that. He's so behind in alimony a bailiff will have to bring him. It must be Mrs. Gimenez for her magic wands. I have no idea where I put them! Stay put, Mom, I'll get it. Poor darling! Feel better? Yeah. Want another hot chocolate? Yeah. With more sugar or less sugar? More. Ever tried hot chocolate with whipped cream on top? You'll lick your chops. Give me a kiss for the road. Who is he? A little cancer patient I look after. You? You're scared of diseases! Don't make fun. You, a volunteer? You scoffed when Grandma cared for the elderly. Called her Lady Bountiful when she fed the poor. You've always said volunteers were just show-offs. And now you're one yourself? Can you believe that? It wasn't planned. His name is Oscar. Make fun of me all you like. I'll look after him, phone the hospital and his parents. I just called. Everyone's worried. Your parents alerted the police. I'm not surprised. They probably think I'll love them in handcuffs. Why so angry? They're afraid of me. Afraid to talk to me. It's not you they fear. It's your illness. My illness is part of me. Does that mean they can only love a healthy Oscar? They'll die one day. Alone, because you'll be gone. And full of remorse at never reconciling with their only child. Their beloved Oscar. Don't say that. It freaks me out. You're a smart boy. You understand you're dying. But you don't realize you're not alone. Everyone dies. Your parents will, one day. And so will I. But I'm at the front of the line. That's true. But does that give you every right? Even the right to forget others? Good evening. He's waiting. I'm sorry. I forgot that you guys will die too someday. Here, honey. I'm warning you, no Yule log if you cry! - Oh my God! - What? I found them! Mephista charges at Joan of Arc! That was my favourite hold. It was kind of my signature. I did it better than her. Amazing. I'd be dead a few times over. The more hits you receive, the more you can take. Never lose hope. The King of the Moon Loves all children On his feather bed He awaits you When you close your eyes He'll gently take you in his arms And silently carry you To the Land of Dreams Dear God, My wish is for my parents to always be like tonight. And me, too. It was a great Christmas. Especially Mephista versus Joan of Arc. Sorry about Mass. I nodded off. - We're going home, Mom. - OK. Goodnight. Goodbye. Mom, I'm so proud of you. Don't express your feelings or she'll slap you. Really. I always thought you were so hard. Appearances are deceiving. In all ways. See what's in store for us, Sis? Sentimentality will get us one day. You asked for that, I don't regret it! I feel better. I love you, you know. I know. Dear God, I'm over 60 now, and I'm paying for last night's excesses. I don't feel so hot. But it was nice to come home to the hospital. When you're old, you don't like to travel. That'll help. Everyone's sick here, even Dr. Dusseldorf, from all the chocolate and foie gras the parents gave the healthcare staff. As you get older, you need your sense of taste. You need to refine it. How's my little gourmet? Any idiot can enjoy life at 10 or 20. But when you're my age and can no longer move, you need to use your intelligence. I tried to explain it to my parents. I'm not sure I convinced them. It's up to you now. I'm tuckered out. Bye for now. Love, Oscar. Well? Reminds me of the good old days. How old are you now? Seventy. Let's use my gift! The plant that lives in one day! What's that? A Saharan plant that lives its life in a day. It's skinny. Yeah, it's no baobab. But it bravely lives its plant life, full speed ahead. There we are. And now this one... will have a chance to bloom. Brilliant. I want to see Oscar. I want to see Oscar. We can't disturb him. I want to see Oscar. Later. I'm not stupid. I want to see him now. Let's go home, dear. Stupid fools. That's no way to behave. It's horrible getting old. Want to write? No. God... I've stopped loving Him. Here are the others. It's not cooked through. Darn! I was too rushed. - I won't charge you. - It's OK. Popcorn! You look... happy? I am. He came. Who? Read this. Dear God, When I woke up, I saw You were here. Everyone was snoozing, but You were busy making the dawn. That's when I understood the difference between You and us. You never get tired. You're always at work. Creating day. Creating night. Creating spring. Creating winter. Then You told me Your secret. To see each day as if for the first time. "I was amazed. "You led me by the hand into the heart of the mystery, "so I could contemplate it. Thank you." PS: My wish is for You to show my parents the first time thing. They need it. I think Rose already knows it. Peggy could use it too, if You have time. Today, you're 100. That's a lot. "Alice began to feel drowsy..." "Once upon a time, 25 tin soldiers..." "Imagine, long ago, elephants had no trunks..." "In a faraway sea, the water is blue as petals..." "Please be kind. "Don't leave me so sad. Write as soon as he returns." Bye, champ. Goodnight, dear. You're all exhausted. Go get some coffee. Go on. We'll stay with him. Go ahead. No! He's gone. While we were gone? Actually, he was the one watching over you. Golden Fairy Studios. Three princess gowns? Of course. Something magical? Of course. Get the door! By adopting you, Oscar made you his heir. It's my first funeral. Until today, I've avoided them. You don't feel guilty, do you? That's absurd. Guilty of what? You did everything you could. Guilty of being helpless. Don't be so hard on yourself! You're not God the Father. You're just a repairman. A human being, nothing more. Go easy, Prof. Dusseldorf. Don't put so much pressure on yourself. You won't last long in this profession. You're fading fast as it is. Thank you. I loved your pizzas. Coming? Dear God, Thanks for bringing Oscar into my life. He filled me with enough love to last the rest of my days. On his night table, I found a card he wrote, meant for You, I think. Only God can wake me up.
