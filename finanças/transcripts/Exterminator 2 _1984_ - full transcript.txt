Please... take anything you want. Leave us alone. I don't remember giving you no appointment to talk, bitch. Man, you remember me giving her an appointment? No. I don't remember nothing about that. Give her a little reminder that she should like... not talk, unless I'd like to tell her she should. Irma! - Irma! - Papa! Because you make me look like a fool, asshole. Bang,bang,bang,bang. Papa! What the fuck? Papa. Yo, Spider, cops. No witnesses. Let's get out of here. Who the fuck are you? Fuck him. Fuck him. Recent events around the city are leading the authorities to surmise that the outlaw hero vigilante, nicknamed by the media, The Exterminator, has returned. Dude, check it out. It's him. It's about that motherfucker that fried Stitch and Max. According to police, at least three suspects were involved in a robbery at the Five Star Liquor store on 118th Street and 1st Avenue. The owners were killed. An unconfirmed report states that a person in an army uniform with a steel mask, confronted the suspects in the alley and incinerated two of them with a flamethrower. It's the same guy, I tell you. It must've been that fucking Exterminator. I don't like that shit. Guys like that are freakos. There's a bunch of sick bastards running around these days. What the fuck is an exterminator, anyway? Some asshole who comes to your house and kills roaches. Everybody knows that. What the fuck? - Your brother's here. - What? Your brother's here. Hey, X, you know that liquor store job from last night? What about it? Some motherfucker with a flamethrower -burned Stitch and Max. - What? They got burned up, I saw it. Some guy set them on fire. Me and Red Rat got away. Somebody with a flamethrower destroyed two of my people? It was weird. I never saw anything like it. This guy came out of nowhere, like some fucking ghost -with a fucking flamethrower. - What did he look like? He's wearing a mask, a big metal mask. I couldn't tell who it was. It was like he knew we were there, and he was waiting. All right. Yeah. Listen, is a girl named Caroline, she dances here, is she working tonight? Yeah, she'll be out in a minute. Give me a beer, will you? Sure, right away. Let me see the paper, will you, Kenny? Yeah. What do you think about that? You got time to think about that. I'm looking for a job. Yeah, everybody needs work. Yeah. Whoo-hoo! I'm just gonna straighten this up. I didn't expect anybody to come up. Maybe I should, uh, go. No. Stay. I don't want you to go. I don't really wanna go. Then, stay. Stitch and Max... ...died for nothing. They died because they were born in the streets. Papers call them animals, or maybe they're right, maybe we-- maybe we all are animals. But look where they make us live. Yeah. We're gonna change all that. We're not gonna move from the streets. We're gonna take over the streets. Yeah. We're gonna sneak up behind the man and take what's rightfully ours. This is a new era, a new time. Yeah. No more petty theft. No more liquor stores. Tonight, half a million dollars, an armored car. - Yeah. - Whoo-hoo! - Yeah, yeah. - Power! Yeah. That's what this is about, power. That money will buy us enough magic powder to cover the streets like a blizzard. Whoo-hoo. A blizzard of power. Yeah. And that's only the beginning. - Yeah. - We will establish a new order. This city is ours. - Yeah. - Let's take it. - I am declaring war. - Yeah. My destiny and yours is to fight for what should be ours. -And to die if we must... - Ours. - In the pursuit of that cause. - It's ours. I am the messiah, and you are my warriors. -Yes. - I like that. I like that. Together, we should take what I want, and I want everything. All of it. All of it. - Including this Exterminator. - Let's do it. The blood of the city flows from our veins. We are the children of the streets, who have grown up to control the very streets that pounded us down along with the filth and the garbage - that ran in its gutters. - Yeah. - Let's take it. - We set fire to the streets. - They're gonna burn. - Everything will burn. -Yeah. - We will build it up again. - Yeah. - And we will control it. Yeah. Think of it, my brothers, - feel the power... - I feel that. ...that we all have when we are together. Feel the power surge through your bodies. - Yeah. - Surging. - Our bodies. - Yeah. - Together we are all powerful. - Yes. And together, together I will rule. Yeah. I will rule. I will rule! Step at it. Get out. Let me have him, X. You've got it. Come to papa, motherfucker. No, no. Come on, come on. Move back. Hey. This is the police. Drop your weapons and stay where you are. Fire! Oh, shit. Yeah. Holy shit. Oh, man. Check that shit out. That is crazy. Oh, shit. Let's go, man. Shit. They're ripping off the armored car. Go. Go. Let's go. Move, move. Come on, you maggots!

It's cool. This is ridiculous. Fifty years and I never dealt with any of this penny-ante crap. Times have changed. Welcome, gentlemen. Here's the money. When do I get my drugs? In good time. This is my time. Don't worry. It's okay. I'm not worried. I'm careful. I'm surprised. I thought you would have brought more assistants. I brought enough. Seven guards? Eight. An advance. I don't need advances. One more thing. - You've got your deal. - One more thing... This, um... this Exterminator who goes around... burning people, killed my brother. Any information... Sorry about your brother. I'll bring you a sample of the goods tomorrow. I'll let you know when and how. Oh, yeah. He's good. You got it, brother, you got it. I need a guinea pig to test this on. Those dog tags you're wearing, must bring back some memories. Yeah. Why are you wearing them? Because the war's still going on. - Hey. - It wasn't a while. Help me. Somebody, help. - Help her. - Somebody help. Hey, hey! Let me.. Let me go! Leave me alone! Please! Just take me home. Let me go, you're hurting me. What are you doing to me? The power. Please let me go! No! Don't hurt me, please. Please. No, no, no! If this stuff is good, can I have her after? With this powder, I control the streets. Good. Next we set up a meeting with them, then we wipe out all competition. You did well, my friend. Hey, you looking for a job, huh? Yeah, maybe, but this wasn't exactly what I had in mind. Hey, look, now this ain't bad. You're your own boss. Nobody calling shots for you, but yourself. So what do you say, you want a job? All right. I'll give it a shot and see what happens. Okay. All right. Come on, man. Let's go. Let's celebrate. You know a place? Yeah, I do. I'm not sure if it's open. We can go by and take a look. Alright. Where are you gonna park this thing?

Hey, I'll see you at the place in the morning. Don't be late, huh? Drive it yourself! I don't know. Do you know how to drive? Move, move. I don't have a great deal of experience with this. Six months ago, I came to New York. Broadway seems about as far away as ever. Oh, no, no. It's right over there. I wish it were that easy. Hey, look. It's that garbage truck that ran over the armored car. Let's get the mother. There it goes. We have to stay close. All right, let's get it. Come on, move your ass. Let me out of there. You're a Broadway dancer, what are you doing working here? What a Broadway dancer does when she can't dance on Broadway. I'm gonna dance on Broadway. And I'm gonna work for Bennett, and I'm gonna work for Fosse. Who are they? The best. No, you are. That's the one. Cops. Come on. Okay. Out. That was the most beautiful dancing I've ever seen. No one has ever danced that great. I mean, that was beautiful. I love that. Oh, that was wonderful. Look, you're getting a standing ovation here. The crowd-- the crowds are on their feet. It was wonderful. I know this girl. I know this girl right here. - Did you like it? - It was great. - Are you kidding? - Did you like it? That was-- that was incredible. It was terrific. I mean, I love all that... - There's a lot more. - I got you an apple. Oh, I'll eat it after the... There's a lot more I can show you, but see, I don't wanna get too tired before the audition, but I think it's a heavy ballet show. So I think they're gonna wanna see-- I mean, the stuff I do in the club, you know, I do that. I can do that, but this is the stuff that I learned since I was a kid. What'd you think? You are the most wonderful dancer on the face of the earth. - No. - That was great. That was great. I love it. I love it. I love it. - It was great. It was great. - I think they're gonna love it. We got to go... I'm gonna love it. What time is it? Is it late? Really late? Hey. Caroline. Carol, what are you doing? What are you doing? Let's go. Let's go on. Here. - I got this? - Yeah. - Oh, thanks. - Oh, yeah. -All right. - Go on. Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! - Johnny! - Hey, this way! Central, send an ambulance to the Sheep Meadow on an injured female. Stay with her. There still may be some swelling and inflammation still aggravating that condition. Did you-- did you know that she was a dancer? I'm sorry to hear about that. - She's a dancer. - Well, she'll need all the support you can give her. Hey, still here. Come on in how. Close your eyes, close your eyes. Open them. Huh? What do you think, huh? It's still the same apartment. Same apartment-- same apartment, she said. She said it's the same apartment. What, are you kidding? We spent two days here, two days of cleaning. - Yeah, that's right. - Look at these floors. I did the floors. I know you did the windows. - Right, you did the windows. - Thank you. Hey, who watered the plants, huh? I watered all the plants, we went shopping, I got some fruit juice, I got some of that herb tea that you like, you know, that organic stuff, huh? Where'd you like me to put the roses? Roses, roses, over here... the vase. We got some fresh fruit too, huh? We got some apples, pears, oranges, huh? A regular health food store around here, huh? Well, what do you think? Come on, look around. Look around. This is home. How do you like it, huh? - Do you miss it? - Excuse me-- Excuse me. Is anybody gonna talk about the artwork here? Anybody notice this, by any chance, huh? Did you see this, huh? This color, this detail, huh? I got a picture of the artist. You got to get the picture of the artist. Well, hey, come on. Come on. All right. Hey, hey. This is a party. This is a celebration we got going here. Caroline. It's gonna be all right. She's gonna make it. God, man. This is a tough one. Look, if you need me for anything, you wanna talk or something, let me know, all right? So, what is it you wanna talk about? I'm not really sure. - Bartender. - Oh. What you drinking, John? Let me just have some scotch, huh? - No ice. - You got it. It's good. It's good. It just seems any time I've ever get... close to somebody, they get hurt. You're thinking too much, man. I'm thinking... I've been all through this before, just innocent people getting hurt. No matter what you think, no matter what you say, there's nothing you can do about what happened to Caroline. Maybe and maybe not. - Yes. - Okay. Reported mugging in alleyway, 119th and 21st and 2nd. Ten-Four. Look at this shit, man. $13 and some change? This fucking broad. This watch ain't nothing to brag about, it's a phony Cartier! Let's go. Did you see the look on her face when you put it through her? - Damn, that was good. - Yeah. I like it when their faces go crazy like that. Like they think the world has gone psycho and there's no way out? There's nothing you can do about what happened to Caroline. Maybe, maybe not. This, uh, Exterminator? Going around torching? He killed my brother and my brother. Hey X, you know that liquor store job from last night? This motherfucker with a flamethrower burned Stitch and Max. They got burned up, torched. Some guy set them on fire, me and Red Rat got away. It was weird. I never saw anything like it. This guy came out of nowhere, like some fucking ghost with a fucking flamethrower, he was wearing a mask. Big metal mask, I couldn't tell you who it was. It was like he knew we were there and he's just waiting. And side, yeah, that's good. Up, side, side. - Are you all right? - Yeah. I can sit up by myself. That's enough for today, huh? You're doing good, huh? You did a lot better than yesterday, huh? How 'bout a few minutes leg exercises, alright? You ready? Up, extend, and down. Up, extend, and down. Up, extend, and down. Hey, John, I don't wanna do this anymore. Okay, what do you say we do a little toe work, a little footwork and that'll be it for the day, huh? Okay. All right, you're on your own. Let's go, let's concentrate. Go on, do it. I'm doing it. There we go. You got a little movement, huh? That's terrific. Let's just move up into the ankle now, huh? Let's just try it with the ankle. Come on, same thing, just concentrate. I can't, you know I can't do that. It's just a matter of time and patience. - Come on, that's it. - Why are you doing this? Why do you keep pushing me? Because you're going to learn how to walk again. I am not going to learn how to walk again. I'm gonna learn how to limp again. - All right. You're just... - You don't understand. -...you're just overtired. - You don't understand. -All right, this is enough... - I'm a dancer. That's what I do. I dance. See? See? Do you wanna get on the bed or the wheelchair? I don't wanna get in the wheelchair, and I don't wanna get in the bed. I don't want to get in the bed. Just go away. Go away. Go, I don't wanna see you! Get away! Get away from me, get out of here! Go away! Go away! Look, is there anything that I can do? No. There's nothing anybody can do here. Listen. Remember what you said in the bar? Well, I thought about it... and there is something else I wanna do. Been saving that just for this kind of occasion. That's all we need. Take a look over there. It looks like some garbage needs to be removed. I got an idea, I'm a pull over here. Hey, you fucking punks. Come on, come on. Come on, motherfucker. Come on. Let's get out of here. Turn around, move. Don't go too fast. I didn't ask you to look at me, did I? That's good, that's good, that's real good. You stay right there. Now, get up. Where are your friends, huh? Where are your friends, huh? Where are they? Where are your friends? I don't remember. I don't remember. - You don't remember? - I don't remember. He don't remember. He don't remember where his friends are at. This is gonna make it more comfortable for you. You're gonna have a place to sit and try to remember where your friends are, all right? Get in! You don't hear me? Maybe you hear that. Get in the truck. Get in the truck. Get in. Do you hear me? I said get in. - How do I get in? - Move. Get in, put your head in. Get in the truck! I said, get in! - You guys are crazy. - I'm crazy? I'm crazy? Come on. I ain't crazy, but I'm mad! Do you hear me? I am mad! - Do you hear that? - Yes! And you tell me-- you tell me one last time where your friends are. I can't tell you, they'll kill me. You can't tell me? You can't tell me? He says he can't tell me. The truck is still hungry. Where's he going? Where's he going? He's gonna make it more comfortable for you to sit. Just think about where your friends are. All right, Be Gee. Let me out! Let me out! Stop! Stop it! No! No! Okay! Okay, okay! They're on-- they're on Pier 3 in Brooklyn. The big drug deal's going down. And you can't get them, they'll kill you. They'll kill you before you can... Pier 3, Brooklyn, right? You're sure you're not lying to me, right? - I'm not lying. -All right, Be Gee! He was good enough to tell us where they are. I'm not lying, man. I'm not lying. Just let me out of the truck. Just let me out of the truck, please. Oh, come on, I told you what you wanted to know. I told you! I told you! Let me out! Let me out! Let's go. Are you ready for this? I've been ready. Come on, man. Let's go. Let me out! I told you! Relax, he's just gonna count it. Half a million dollars. Tony, go show them what they bought. That's weighed to the thousandth of a gram. Go on, taste it. You street boys are really growing up. I am the streets. If you say so. Just so long as the streets stay in power. Next, I take over the city. You're a little too late for that. There. Over there. That bag, that's got to be it. I got to get it. - I have to get it. - Go get it. I'm gonna die. Just get it. Be Gee! Listen, you got yourself the truck. Shit. Eyes. I didn't know. I should've been with you guys. But you weren't, were you? I couldn't. Those guys in the garbage truck, they caught us in the park. Monster and Luke got away, but... they threw me in the back of the truck. They crushed me, man. You were the only one that could've told them about the buy on the pier. X... I swear, I didn't say anything. Don't lie to me. I came here because I know something that you don't know. That's why I came. What don't I know? The guy in the garbage truck, and the guy with the flamethrower, it's the same guy! Flamethrower? Yeah. They were doing some very weird things to that garbage truck. When I got out, I saw the flamethrower. He's the Exterminator. He's the guy that wasted your brother! That's why I'm here. I done good, huh? Done good, done good. Look out. Look out. Gasoline! Right there. This is flour. Where's my drug? Let's check them out. You want to play a game? You're a killer, Johnny, just like me. We're both killers. How do you like being hunted like an animal, Johnny? How do you like being the animal, Exterminator? He who lives by the sword... Dies by the sword! I could accept that, Johnny. Can you accept that? Are you ready to die? You want to clean up the streets? I am the streets. What are you hiding from, masked man? What's the matter? Do I make you nervous? Are we too much alike? You killed my brother, Johnny. I'm gonna have to kill you. I'm coming after you, Johnny. That mask... won't hide you from the truth, Johnny. We're all animals... and we all must die. The only question is when... and how.
