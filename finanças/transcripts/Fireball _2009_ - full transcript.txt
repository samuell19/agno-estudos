Man: It's not easy to pull strings like that and get them to drop the charges. Luckily for you, your brother knows where to spread his wealth, otherwise you'd be rotting in there for the rest of your life. Hey, pang, where's my brother? What happened? He was severely beaten. He has a serious head injury. They haven't caught anybody. The police said it's just another assault case. It must be a lie... Because lately, tan, he was coming home all... Bruised up pretty bad. When I asked him about it, he said it was... From playing some... Some basketball. I'm not stupid. I figured that he was... Messed up with something illegal. He said he needed cash. They let me out because of the money from tan? Mmm-hmm. So, where did he go? To make the cash? Come on, come on. Hey, show me what you got. Get him! Get him! Get him! No good. How about him? Where? The one that's shooting now. You mean that guy there? Another team already got him. Alright, come on. Hey. Hey. Hey! How about that guy over there? You back playing again? So, you still with boss por? I'm looking for some tough men to play, for a new team too. From what I hear, you're a hot shot. Join me. You play, I pay, it's win-win. You still alive? I thought you were brain dead already. They beat the shit out of you last year. Hey. Listen, is revenge what you want? And the cash prize? Much bigger than last year's jackpot. Think about it. Alright, you take him upstairs and wait for me. Mmm-hmm. Go. Come in. The boss is here. Boss, this guy here says we're ripping him off. If we don't give him a better rate, he says he'll go somewhere else. Man: This is our best offer. Wait, wait, wait. We agreed. It's too much to pay. See? He said we had a deal and now our rates are too high. What are these guys thinking anyway, that we're the bank of Thailand? My rates are what they always are. Look, if they're not happy, they can go find themselves another lender. Good luck. They want it? Go on, take it. Well, how about it? Whatever you want. Alright. Now, then. Hey, come on. You ready? Let's go. You gotta check this out. That's zing, the captain. He's auditioning for new team-mates. That's IQ. He's our secret weapon. He may have a baby-face, but he's got the heart of a lion. Hey, zing, check it out. Go on, show us what you got, er... Your name, I forgot. Tan. Tan. Zing. Zing: Hey, I dig the hair, man! So, are you a monk or what, huh? Man, he's a wild one. Yeah. If they can play together, we'll have ourselves a pretty topnotch team. So, zing, is he in or not? Yeah, sure. He's alright. Ok. It's time to get to work. They belong to tan. I think they're your size. Ok, 300,000. Hello. Hello. Good to see you. Why did you mess with that guy? The guy's just a toothless loser. I mean, take boss Louis here, at least he's a drug dealer. How are you, sir? How are you, sir? Make yourselves at home. In a little while, we'll talk about fireball. Sit down. Welcome, sir. Er, I'm den, and I used to work for boss song, sir. I, er, I brought you your favourite wine. Appreciate it. Yes, sir. Den here is a rising star. You've really gotta keep an eye on him. He's only in fireball 'cause his boss died three months ago. I tell you right now, if boss song were still around... A runt like den will be nothing more than a boy to run his errands. They're a bunch of zombies in den's group. He's got song's old gang and a couple that were kicked out of there by boss yong. Bunch of hopeless losers. So, when you meet on the court, your guys will thrash them, right, yong? It's gonna be an easy day. I don't get it, boss. How can we play with only four? What's the deal? Serious? You want this snake on our team? Are you kidding me?! He threw a match last year, remember? Den: Trust me. It's alright. But, boss. Come on, muk. Back off, man! Come on! Me throw a match? Believe that and you're a dumb-ass. You think I'm a cheater? Right. Hey, k, you messing with me, you scumbag? Hey, hey, come on, come on, come on, come on. Hey. Hey! He's an asshole! Why are you fighting each other? Huh? It's time for you to work together, right? You guys got to focus only on your opponents if you think you're gonna win. Boss yong's team are just a bunch of losers from his gambling den. They're determined to win the match and clear their debts. These guys are basketball players, fighters and mostly thugs. Well, that's just great. How about the fact that none of us has ever played together as a team before? Are we getting out of here alive? Don't worry. Huh? You guys are gonna kick some ass. Zing, take care of your men. Mmm, let's go. Hey. You guys can do this. Come on, come on. Go on. Making a comeback? So, this is fireball, huh? It's not like I thought it was. Tell me how the rules work. There's five men on each team. Whoever scores first is the winner. Hmm. That it? Mm-hmm. That's about all there is. The rules have changed a little this year, though. Even if you don't score, whichever team has the last man standing will be declared the winner. Sounds like a cruel game if you ask me. So, what does it actually cost you to put this thing together. The team owners put in a lot of the money and in the meantime their bookies are taking bets from the crowd. At each match, there's over $300,000 changing hands. But that's not all. The prize money goes up after each round. In the final, it's worth over 3 million. So basically, fireball is just another business for the bosses to make money. Ok. Count me in. Muk! Muk! Muk! Muk! I'm open. Over here! K. Zing! You got a problem? Hey, check it out! There's a black guy in the ring! You want a fight? Sonofabitch! I'll break your neck! Come on! Muk! Muk! You're a dead man. Come on, man, calm down. Calm down, man. Easy, IQ! Calm down! Let's go! You're going down! Tun, I thought you destroyed that jerk last year. Why's he back? They're killing each other out there. Yeah, so what happens then? When a player is crippled and can't play? The play continues on but there's no replacing players at all. IQ! IQ! It's coming to you! Muk! Muk! You're an asshole, k! Zing! Muk! Argh! Zing: Watch out! Muk! Zing! You're the man! Yeah! Way to go, zing! It is you. Why are you still here? I already split your head open with my foot. Maybe he's looking for a repeat. Hell, last time he beat you, bad too. You were practically dead, yet you're still walking. Yeah, well, it won't happen again. Come on! Keep playing! Break it up! Fight, baby, fight! Hey, they're fighting! Put them on the court! Asshole! Look out, baby! Don't give up! Don't stop! You're gonna kill him! You're a dead man! You're dead! Want some more?! Is that it? Don't show your face around here. I'll get you good this time. Let go of me! Yeah! Let go! That's right! Come on! You smug little... When I get my hands on you, you're dead. Den: Tan. Tan! Tan! Tan. Stop it. Tan, calm down. Easy, take it easy. Cool it, man, save it for later. You do that and our team is screwed. If you want revenge, you've gotta save it for the game. You can kill him on the court and nobody will give a damn. Meaning what? The rules, man. Off-court fighting is forbidden. The penalty is that the whole team can be whacked. You wanna fight me, boy? You guys make it to the finals. Get out of my way! His team were the champions last year. They're waiting for a challenger in the final. To fight this prick, we have to make it through to the last round. Tal, you're badly bruised. It's nothing. Look after him. Good afternoon. Can I help you? Come over here. Boy: Let's chill out here for a while. Boy 2: Yeah, sounds good. Boy 3: Nice. Come on, guys. Get a move on. Unless you're buying. Come on, go. Come on, come on, come on. Get outta here. Come on. Oops. Sorry, bro. Hey. Hey, man, your mom's in deep shit. Huh? Your mom's house. You're gonna sleep with the dogs tonight, man. Man: How many times you said that? Alright, son, lock it up. Where are we going to live if you kick us out? What do I care? It's not my problem. You gotta move out. What will we do? Hey, wait. Hey! Hey! Knock it off. This is going too far, man! What's that? Making us move out of our place! Come on! Pay up if you want another night here. I told you I don't have the money! Hold on a second. Now what?! Take this. My bike. Take it! Alright, I'll take it. Sang, open up the door. And you still owe me the rent next month! Fine! 'Bye! Pain in the ass. Move your ass! Lucky I'm understanding. Don't worry, ma, pretty soon... I'll be able to buy this place. I won't let anyone kick us around like that. I'll cover his school too. Oh, be realistic, son. Where will you get that kind of money? Getting water. Oooh. Ok, hold on. You'll be alright with this. Feeling better? Let's get rid of it. We're not... in any position to raise a little baby. Oi, how can you say that to me? Listen up now. Bringing a baby up in a world like this... It won't feel abandoned at all. Like I was. It'll be alright, I swear it. Believe me? Uh-huh. What? Too disgusted to kiss a whore? No. Just... not in the mood. I'll make your mood change. Where are you going? Time to go. Will you be coming back tonight? Maybe later. Take a look around. 100 each. This one just arrived. Woman: I like this one. I'll take it. Ok. Thank you. Come back. No problem. Goodnight! Come back soon! Hello. Come in and take a look. I'll give you a discount. Pang, you can go. I'll look after tan from now on. My college cancelled my scholarship. Pretty soon they were gonna expel me. But tan did whatever he could. He worked very hard to get the money for me. He wouldn't let me pay him back. Please don't tell me to go. My heart says he will come back. Oh, dammit! Hey, boss, the court has subpoenaed you to testify again. If you don't show up again this time, they'll probably arrest you. What now? Jesus, these bastards don't ever quit. Alright. My lawyer has to write a petition to stall a few more weeks. I'll pull some strings if I can. Right, boss. It's kind of strange, yong. Your team's already crashed out of the tournament. I thought I'd be playing you in the next round. Well, I may have lost in the ring but I made huge profits from my bookies. Yeah. Right. I mean, think about it... I've already recovered my investment and maybe I'll make more than the winning team before it's all over. Hmm? Den, your boys don't look like losers to me. Den: Thank you very much, sir. L, er... Let's talk business later. Yes, sir. Don't be so brash. It's only the first round. Got that right. Hey, den, you got life insurance for your boys? Don't forget about that. The families must have that. What's this?! What the hell are you guys doing? I told you to practise, not to sit around drinking. Well? Relax. We're just taking a break. Muk: But what about this secret weapon you got here? He gets on the court and the kid's all nervous. You keep pushing us, man. We're exhausted. And we need incentive. Ok. That's right. You're my man, tan. That's right. IQ? K? Do you agree with tan? I dig it. That's right! Sure, I do. What's it gonna be? Incentive. Gotta have incentive. Yeah? Of ok. You see this? Yeah, yeah, we see it. You see this cash? What about it, man? Take a good look at it. Now, you see that basketball court? That kiddie court? Yeah. Ok. Whoever gets this ball here into that hoop down there can have all this money. Go! Man, I'm on it. Don't you want the money, tan? It's chump change. Come on! Shh! Shh! Woman: What are you doing? Ohh! Ahh! Get out of here! No playing in the hallway. Watch out, boys! Oh, shit. Oh, shit! Hey! Oh, noogies! Get out! Hey, watch out! Oi! Hey! Move it, jerk! Oh, sweet. I got it. Good doggie. Woman: Hey! Hey, get out of there! Come on, take the shot, man, take the shot! IQ! Put it up, man! Whoo! You ok? Let's go! Where is it?! Den: Hey, 1q, watch out! Hey, zing, watch it! He's after you! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Bastard! IQ! Stop! Zing, cover lq! Watch out! Get away! Go on! Go! Zing, pass it! 1q, look out! Whoa! IQ! IQ! L1q: I'll be able to buy this place. I won't let anyone kick us around like that. Dammit! Hey. Let it go, man. He's gone. So it's just a bigger share for the rest of us. You're disgusting! I should kill you! Hey, cut it out! You threw the match! What's the point in this? IQ was just killed, so why fight each other? Tell me! Don't you know? That prick had the nerve to throw a match last year. You were nearly beaten to a pulp! And now llq's gone too. Who on the team will be next? Believe what you wanna believe. K, where are you going?! Get back here! We're not through with you yet! Kl Den, let me win the next match. How much will it cost me? You really think it's a good idea? It's just my first year. Think about it. If you want to have a future in this game, you should seriously consider my offer. Tan! Tan! Over here! Muk! Muk, I'm open! It's me. Muk! Hey! That prick bastard was trying to throw the match! He's so stupid he couldn't even pull it off! Man: You're a cheater! You're still a cheater! You're going down! It's so obvious. He threw the whole thing. That guy cheated! You should teach him a lesson! You're gonna get what's coming to you! I want my money back! Give me my money back! Come on, man, get them! Get them out of here! You son-of-a-whore! Come on! Come on out here! Muk: I'm sorry. I couldn't let us win today. What, do you think we're dumb?! Zing, listen to me. Hit him, man, hit him! My wife, she's having a baby. I need the money for his future. Please! I'll quit fireball forever! Zing! I'm sorry. Get out here! We'll take care of you! It's not just me and him! Get him out here! Yeah, we've got others. Come out here, man. We'll take care of you! You're dead! You're a dead man, pal! You're a dead man! Muk! Muk! Muk! Muk! Muk! Muk, get out! Get off of me! Let me go! Muk. Muk? Muk! Boss! Boss, did you know about muk's deal? You don't have to play dirty like those pricks! Zing, man, don't you have any idea why you've kept winning the matches every time? If I get beat, then I'm not allowed to remain here, so I must win this thing, don't you get it? No matter what it costs! You mean like 1q? And muk too?! Who's next, boss? Tan?! K?! Maybe just like what you did to your boss, right? Look, zing, when you're in that cage, if you don't kill them, they'll kill you in a heartbeat. You know that better than I do! I'm not gonna answer your question. But if you don't trust me, just go ahead and quit on me! Go on! Fine! I quit! Look... I want out. Pang, what are you doing? What are you doing here? Don't we have enough problems? What makes you think you've gotta do something so pathetic? It's not just about me! How about what you've been doing? You think I'm doing this for me? Let's go. No! Come on! No! Hey! I'm not talking to you. Calm down, son. A few things that I'd like to discuss. You may not realise your girl owes me. She came to pay her debt. As for you, hmm, you must be an idiot, brains in your ass. You've brought shit on me since you pulled out of the final. You're ruining my business, do you know that? I've already accepted wagers on your guys. There's no way I'm gonna let you back out and I have to pay people back. I'll tell you once, shithead, you boys better be in that tournament. Or else I swear your gorgeous little bitch goes straight to the whorehouse. Hey! Now you listen. You don't give the orders. I'm not one of your boys. I make my own decisions. Heh. Four grand. It's only a deposit. Make it happen that you guys get beat pretty bad... Then come and collect the rest. Make your decision wisely but then do it really quickly. The doctor told me that tan's getting worse. He needs an operation. I wanna be able to help tan. Why won't he wake up, tai? I can't leave him. But I don't know if he'll ever wake up. Tan will come back to me. He'll come back to me, won't he, tai? Please tell me he will. I just want him back with me. Pang. Listen to me. I'll do everything I can... Fo bring tan back. Tan. Charge! Clear! Charge! Clear! Charge! Clear! So far we've been able to use your blood to sustain your brother and keep his condition from worsening. But it's only a temporary measure, and we can't keep doing this forever. There's been no improvement in his brainwaves. His only chance is the operation. But it's very risky as well as quite expensive. There is another option. You can let him go. I think you're wrong about the boss. He's not the kind of guy who'd resort to foul play. I... I know the whole story. And you... I could tell from the very beginning you're not tan. I was the one who sent the money to your lawyer. Tun and I, and tan, we put some money down, then we threw the match. Tan wanted money to get you out of jail. We thought we could just make some spare money on the side. Just tun didn't trust tan. He came up with a plan. He decided to kill your brother. Everyone knows tun is a wild animal. He'd even kill his own men if he suspects them. There, I've told you everything. Either believe it or not, man. You think I'm really that cold-blooded? Never mind the crap, alright? They tell me tan's dying. He needs an operation. You told me it'd take 10 minutes. It's almost an hour now. Do you really know what you're doing? Maybe we should see someone with more experience. How hard can it be? Are you dumb or what? I think we'll just go... l quit! Tal, please stay here. I don't wanna see you end up like tan. You pray, boy, because your time's nearly up here. Alright, tun, last year you lost an eye in the championship match. It's time to get your revenge. Go in there and make him beg as you rip his eyeballs out. No problem. Before I'm through with that punk, he'll be begging, alright. Don't forget your promise, you prick. If you weren't my best player, I wouldn't let you talk to me like that. Oh, don't worry about him. He'll be fine, sir. A little psych job, it makes him work faster. 35 years, since the first game, we've been using this ball for every final round. And we're back here, the place where it all began. This is the place where the fireball game actually began. Hey, I don't get it. How come the champs have only three men? Hmm. They know we only have three, so they're only gonna use three. It's not sportsmanship, they're psychos. They don't give a rat's ass about winning. They wanna turn this into a bloodbath. Do you think our boys can match them? We've come this far. I don't care if we win or lose today, I just want the boys to come out of there alive. Bastard! You're a dead man. Let's go! Aargh! Come on, asshole! Argh! I'll let you watch as your friend dies. Next we'll come for you. Aargh! Hey, zing. Check out the goods. Idiot. Did you really think you could get away with this? Just listen, tan. Don't be stupid, tan. You're messing with the wrong guy. When my boys hear, you're gonna be... Your boys are a bit late. Alright, tan, what do we do now? No more hoops, man. I'd rather use these. I swear to you I'm gonna slaughter every one of them... And not just for what I went through, but for what they did to tai as well. I'll find them all and force them to pay.
