Inhabitants What happened? Nothing, all good. 2:45 in the morning, why? -Is it related to the accident? -No. Why not? Because the accident happened around 6 am. Let's talk about that. How much you do remember? Cero. But you dream about the accident. Yes, but... ...what I dream is not a memory. Then, what is it? Have you been told stories of you as a child, your aunts, your mother, those stories that are... ...impossible for you to remember, but they've repeated them so many times that... ...after imagining them over and over. -Those stories begin to look more like -Memories. That's what I dream. Stories. How long ago was the accident? Four years now. I was at a bar. It was late. I grabbed the car keys from the valet. I took the car, and crashed it against a tree in the forest, in Chipinque. Three months after, I woke up in a hospital with no memory of it. -You lived in Chipinque? -No. -Then, what were you doing there? -That's the question. What's the last thing you do remember? I was about to turn 30. My friends wanted me to make a huge party, but I wanted something more. So, I sold my car. I had some money saved, and said to myself, why not? Spain, six months. And you moved to Spain. They say. -So, from 30 to 35, you remember nothing? -I don't even remember turning 30. How long it's been since you returned to Monterrey? Officially to live, a week, but we visited the house a month ago. The garage can store up to three cars. It has three and a half bathrooms, and two bedrooms. It's fully furnished, but if you don't want the furniture it's up for negotiation. -When did the nightmares started? -Just as the migraines. Glasses, plates, cups, pans, everything. Emiliano, what's wrong? Everything alright? Yes, all good. It was an ice pick headache, but it's gone. Please, continue. It also includes a smart house system. It has many functions. You can basically control the entire house. Here, you can turn on and off the lights one by one. You can also control all the doors -And the pool curtain. -Which pool? I'll show you in a minute. You want to go upstairs first? Yes, of course. As you can see, it also includes security cameras, but they need to get reactivated. There is one in the front porch, the living room, and the backyard. Emiliano? It has everything you can ask for. Location, security, comfort, equipment, price, everything. -Do you like it? -What do you think? Ready to sign? This is the last one. -What is that? -It says Nina. Yes, but in the back? It says... ...books -That goes in the studio. Sorry. I can't sleep. Did I wake you? I heard something. Alright, come on. And the giraffe said: "How could you not remember? Elephants have the greatest memory in the world" Then the elephant replied: "I'm not an elephant, I'm a mammoth" "You can't be a mammoth" The giraffe said. "Mammoths extinguished thousands of years ago" "If I was an elephant, I'd remember to be an elephant, but as I don’t remember it, I'm not" The mammoth said. -I have a lot to do. -Really? -Yes, really, -Aha, yeah. And it's the very last week. If I don't do it now, I'll forget. I’m the birdbrain, remember? -What happened? -Nothing, all good. Sofia! Hey, breakfast is ready. -What were you doing? -Nothing. Nothing, I swear. I'll go down now. Okay, by the way. It will be done today. Don't take too long. It gets cold. Yeah. Good morning, Sofia. How did you sleep? Did you take the pill? Yes. Sofia! How many times have I told you not to play with your food sweetie? It should the bed, you're not used to it That should be it. I have to enroll Sofia to school, -I have to buy some paint, go grocery shopping. -Paint? Yes, paint. For Sofia's room. I think the wall had some wallpaper on and there's glue all over. We need to remove it. How about a wallpaper? I mean. A unicorn or something. I'm not sure. I can't decide. Would you go with me? I have a meeting with Arturo at 11. Also, I need to unpack. And you need to fix the studio. And the studio. -Sofia, sweetie! -I'll clean it up. -Don't forget the dishes. -I won't! Nina? Emiliano! Nina, is that you? They don't fit Emiliano. With yours, we'll be eleven trucks over capacity. But at least half will be on the road. Even like that, they still don't fit. We need a bigger state. Okay, so how much would that be? -A lot. -But the diesel evens it up. The diesel? Okay guys, how about if we continue next week, we got extended anyway. -Fine for me. -Okay. Hey, Emiliano, why don't you just come to my place? so I can finally see you, we can talk about the office, the diesel contract, and... -Or, if you prefer I can go to your place. -No, no, no, the house now is a mess. As your ex roomate, I think I know your mess, perfectly What's wrong? Nothing, just this migraine that won't go away. It most be the stress of moving. I know what you need. -Friday, open house, no matter your house condition. -No Why not? How about dinner? anything. Or you don't want to show me your house? Okay, but let me talk to Nina first. Friday or Saturdar. I'll let you know. Okay, It's a date then. I'll call you. Emiliano! Emiliano! Boo! -What's wrong with you? -I'm sorry! -I hate to get scared out. -Since when? Nina? babe. It is your right to be mad at me. I fucked it up. I'm not trying to justify myself, but I've been sick lately. I still am. Who are you talking to? You know me, you know I'm not that kind of guy. Emiliano, what happened? Emiliano. -Did you see her? -See who? If you don't tell me who, I can't help you. There's something I haven't told you. Traumatic brain injuries like yours could come with various secondary effects post-surgery. Temporary or permanent amnesia, distress, fear, paranoia, and in some cases, hallucinations. Strange thing is that you had non of these symptoms until now. So, what's happening to me? That's what we need to figure out. For now, the scan showed nothing. Nothing that can tell us what's triggering these hallucinations. -Then what should we do Doctor? -Treatment, for the moment, and... And that's how I ended up here. I'm going insane, right? No. It can't be ghosts. I don't believe in ghosts. It has to be... ...I don't know. Tell me. It has to be schizophrenia or something. Don't do that. And the hallucinations? Emiliano, my job is to help you find the answers, but it takes time. We need a lot more than one session to know what's happening. Let me ask you something. Why coming back to Monterrey? Because I studied here. My friends from college live here. I don't know. After the accident, I moved back to Mexico City with my mom, but I... ...I always felt like something was missing. Like if I'd left some unfinished businesses. You had a life in Monterrey. A job, friends. Your accident was here. That feeling that something is missing is real. Something is missing. Your memory. And as long as you don't get back those five years of your memory, you'll always feel incomplete. Possibly, going back to Monterrey had triggered something in your brain. Like what? We don't know that yet. It's a process, trial and failure. Post-traumatic stress disorders could bring along many things, Anxiety, intranquillity, panic attacks, hallucinations... The mind is a powerful thing, and it holds many secrets. But to unravel those secrets, we most follow the clues, and that takes time. I'll prescribe you something for the anxiety and insomnia, okay? I'll see you next week? I almost forget, one last question. When you saw the woman on the screen, you felt her? I beg your pardon? You said the woman placed her hand on your shoulder. You felt it? Her hand on your shoulder? Thank you, that's all. Hi, sweetie! How are you? -How she behaved? -Very well. -Did you eat? -Yes, even the veggies, right? Very good baby. Let's see. Hey, and the doll I got you? Thank you so much. -You sure you don't want me to take you? -No, they'll be here soon. -Which doll? -The one I gave you. Which one? Sofi, -The mermaid doll. -Which mermaid? The doll I gave her. It wasn't a mermaid. It was a princess. A princess? Can I go play in my room now? Yes, but first what's first. -To the shower. -No! Yes, yes, yes, shower time. You should've seen Pablo's face. He turned all red . We should start thinking of what we're going to do. About what? If I continue like this and they have to admit me, and I can't be with you anymore. Stop that. In sickness and in health. Don't you remember? -That's what you say now, but... -But nothing. We will find out what's happening to you and find a solution together. Although, now that I think about it. Maybe we should change everything under my name. At once. Oh really? Yes. -Oh really? -Just in case Really? No, stop, hold on, stop. Please stop. -What? -Please, stop. -I need to use the restroom. -Yes, aha. It's for real. That was fast. It's a new record. Hello? -Hi, thanks for coming. -Where is him? -When did all this stared? -A few days ago. -Any headaches, insomnia? -All of that. Mom? When were you planning to invite me to your new home? It was a surprise for Christmas, but... ...what are you doing here? -I could leave if that's what you want. -No, no, no. It's just a surprise. A good one, I hope. Of course it is. -You're too skinny. -I'm just tired, that's all. Cute, right? Small, but cute. -How many rooms? -Three. Well, two and a studio. Two? And what would you do when you have children of your own? Bunkbeds. We have no plans for more children for now. It's up to you, I mean after all, that's none of my business, right? -Mom! -Son! -Would you like us to give you a tour? -Of course! Sure. Well, it's a two story house plus the patio. You called her? I didn't know what else to do. You told her? Next time you consult me first. You don't know her. I don't understand. You moved back to Monterrey to get in debt with this house, -When you could've just asked me. -We've talked about this. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Yes, I know, your independency, etc. But you don't even have help for god sake. Look at that. What are you doing here? If the mountain doesn't go to Mahoma, Mahoma goes to the mountain. -Hello aunt. -Arturo. Hello Nina. How are you? -Didn't we say on the weekend? -Yes, but as you were acting weird yesterday -But it you're busy, I can come back later. -No, no, no. You have stay for dinner. Sounds good to me. -Long time no see. -Long time. How you've been? No, no. Backpacking through Europe, not again. I told him: you should stay with my cousin in Madrid and travel from there. -That way, you'll always have... -A place to come back to. Exactly! How long you were there? Five months. I left for new year's eve and came back on April. No, you came back on May. January, February, March, April, May. Right? Stop it kid! Give me that, Sofía. -I help you, Nina. -Thank you. I haven't show you the house yet, right? I don't think so. Once we're done. Son! What's wrong? Emiliano. Take the kid. -Let's go to your room honey. -Look at me. Look me in the eyes, look at me! You see her? Where? And the little girl? Son! Is the little girl with her? Come. What's wrong? -I have to go. -Good night then. I'm heading out. -Let me know if you need anything, okay? -Okay. He is finally asleep. We need to let him rest. I think is best if I spend the night with him, and you with your daughter. I'll be back. Who's there? It's no one Emiliano. You're imagining this. It's in your mind, it's in your mind. Leave me alone!! I heard a scream. -I'm going crazy mom? -No. -Completely insane. -No, no, no. You will be fine. I promise, I'll take care of it. Here it is. My son. His wife. -Nice to meet you. -Good afternoon. Emiliano. This is bullshit. -Emiliano! -No, leave him. Hi! Hi! -Can I keep you company? -Sure. We're here to communicate with the entity that lives in this house. Tell us who you are, what do you want, what's your purpose here. Something wrong? Hands! Where are you going? What? Tell us what you want. We just want to help you, so can cross. You can ask for anything. What happened? -I have to leave this house. -What? This house. This place is cursed. -But, it said something, what did you see? -I saw and heard nothing. I can't help you. So, what was all this? I saw and heard nothing, but I felt it. Felt what? The pain. -What does that mean? -That I have to leave this house, same as you all. Who are you? What do you want? As I just explained ma'am, it is very important. And as I also just explained, the house was built by Arce Architects, then sold. If the house had other owners later, we don't have that information. And about the first owner, I'm not authorized to provide that information. -There are no exemptions? -I'm sorry, but no. Your property deed must include the previous owner's name. -Yes, it does, but that's not what I... -Talk to the registration office. I need information about the previous owners of a property. I just bought a house. You have to fill up a form. You can do it online and it could take from three to four days. -Who can I talk to? -It can't be done on the phone. This line is for information only. If it's urgent, you can walk into the offices but there are no guarantees. Donation books. Where are you going? I'm taking the books to donate. Right now? I need to feel useful. -How do you feel? -Fine. -You haven't eaten anything. -I'll get something on the way. -Leave them there. I'll take them tomorrow. -No! -I want to do this. -Okay. -My mom? -She went out. -She said where? -No. Excuse me, neighbor. Good afternoon. -Neighbor. -Yes? Hi, my name is Emiliano. I'm your neighbor. -I know who you are, what you need? -I would like to ask you some questions. -To me? -About the house. We just moved here. I'm really busy right now. This will sound weird, but do you know if something happened there? I beg your pardon? -How long you've lived here? -Twenty years. So, if something had happened, you would know it? -Please, leave. -I'm begging you. Something is wrong, and I can't find information about the house. You know if someone died there? Please, do not come back to my house. I'm sorry. I can't give you that information. You need a proper form or an order. -Can you make an exception? -I'm not authorized. Who is? So, according to the system. This house have had five owners. You must be the last one. Then we have Inmonterrey I guess that's the real-estate agency that sold it to you, and then... Yes? I don't know. He didn't sleep at all last night. He is getting aggressive. What is this? I don't understand. I really don't know what you're talking about. Here it says that the second owner of the house, was you. There's something you need to know. Date of purchase: January 5th, 2016. That can't be. Arce Architects sold it to you in 2016. You sold it to Arturo Martinez Ruiz in 2018. -Then he sold it to... -Wait. Who did I sell it to? It's Emiliano. -Listen, Nina... -I never mentioned her. The little girl. When I spoke to you on the phone I never said he was seeing a little girl What he says he sees. What he believes he sees in the house are not ghosts. They're memories. Memories? Of whom? Hello, this is Arturo. You know what to do. Call me. I need to know what the fuck is happening. What if he already knows? -Know what? -The truth about the accident. He wasn't alone in the car. Here it says: Emiliano Montemayor García. Date of purchase: January 5th, 2016. I left for new year's eve and came back on April. No, you came back on May; January, February, March, April, May. He was supposed to come back in May, but two weeks before, he met Amaya. I took the car, and crashed it against a tree in Chipinque. -You lived in Chipinque? -No. -Then, what were you doing there? -That's the question. He came back in December, married, and expecting a child. And they bought this house. You were the trigger. A woman alone with a child. No. He hadn't mentioned Monterrey until you showed up. And he reached me out looking for a fusion. He searched for a house for months, but until this one appeared, he decided to move. No. We left to stay way from you. Really? Then why didn't you leave the same day of the wedding? Unconsciously, he is rebuilding his life. Amaya! Babe, I'm here! Amaya! When was the last time you saw them? Before I left for the gym. Around 7. What time you came back from the gym? Around 9. Something unusual you noticed, a window or door open? No, nothing. Everything looked normal. I called her, but as she didn't answer, I assumed she was in the shower or something. You've been drinking? No. I grabbed a beer to watch the game, but I fell asleep. Prior to arrival, were you drinking? How's that relevant to my wife and daughter's disappearance? No, I wasn't drinking. Then I guess you'd have no objection for us to register the house, right? Of course not. Any previous argument? Any reason that comes to mind of why would she wanted to leave? No, none. Yes? You know this phone? It's Amaya's. How do you open the pool? There is a... ...a button on the wall.. Please. Amaya! We'll go a little deeper this time, okay? One, two, three. One more time. Let's do it again, but take a deep breath. One, two, three. No, no, no, no. Let me go! Let me go!! No! No! No! No! We're taking you out of here. -It was an accident. -The camera shows that you arrived, shot everything down, sat to watch the game. There is no evidence you knew they were in the pool. You're innocent. Innocent? You want something to drink? You can stay as long as you need. Are those my things? You know your mother. Here you have cigarettes, and... ...anything you need, I'm two meters away. Arturo. Thank you. Every neurologist we spoke to, agreed the same. That he would never get his memory back. So, you decided to erase them. I had a suicidal son, Nina. -You deceived him all this time. -To protect him of himself. You lied to him. Everybody new, his family, his friends, at work, everyone. -And you helped her. -We did what we considered necessary. Listen to me. Life was giving him a second chance, Nina. Now he's getting too close to the truth, and I'm not sure if he can take it. Help us. Convince him to sell, tell him the house is hunted, anything. You have to tell him, you have to confess. I don't know if I should, I don't know if I could. Why not? Oh, I know. Because you erased all memory of my family. -You erased them yourself. -Everything makes sense now. The missing passport. -My camera. -Let me explain. You had no right. Yes, I had. She was your granddaughter. I didn't want you to suffer. I wanted to suffer! I wanted to pay. But, you're not guilty. I need you to leave. Emiliano. -Get the hell out too. -Dude, forgive me. Any mother in my position would have done the same, Nina? Any human being would have done the same. Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday, Mariana, happy birthday to you. Bravo! Now blow. One, two, three! Bravo! Amaya! Have you seen my phone? Give it to me sweetie, I have to go. Give it to me. Hey,. don't run! Where is Mariana? Where is that little girl? Boo! Dad? How did you call me? -Are you crying? -No What are you doing awake? When the elephant realized he had no fur, or long curved tusks. The giraffe said: "You see how you were not a mammoth?" But the elephant replied: Fur or no fur, long curved tusks, or not, I will always be a mammoth. Did you make a decision? Emiliano. Emiliano. What was the question? What did you decide? You're keeping the house? So, no more ghosts, right? So, no more ghosts? Inhabitants
