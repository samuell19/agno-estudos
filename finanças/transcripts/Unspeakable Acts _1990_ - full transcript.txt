Okay, little girl on the bicycle, I see you speeding. I see you. Okay, pull over, pull over. Pull over. Come on, let me do this. You get ready. Good morning. Hey, no coffee this morning. Housekeeper's still on vacation, and no one else knows how to use a coffee maker. Well, thanks. That's all right, lieutenant. Morning, Maggie. Gimme. Kid doesn't stand a chance. What do you mean? You're a cop; She's a cop. You're raising another lady cop. Yeah, if she's real lucky, she'll land an off-duty job guarding country walk like you. Hey, I work hard. It's a crime-free zone. Bye! Okay! Say, "bye-bye." Bye-bye! Bye-bye. I'll see you later! Bye-bye. Wave bye-bye. Say, "bye-bye, dad." Bye-bye, dad. * * Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Hey, hey, you. Morgan, morning. Hey, where's my sweetie? Hey. Hey, come here, pumpkin pie. I'm going to get you, Morgan. I'm going to get you. Hey, you, come here. Yeah, come here. Okay, all right, just a slight problem. Hey, it's okay to play like this with mommy. When I take you to the babysitter and she wants to change your diapers, don't you go running away. You got that, alligator? We got a reputation to maintain here. She'll think we didn't teach you any manners at all. All right, Richard. Make yourself useful and hand me a diaper wipe. All right. Diaper wiper. Diaper. Diaper. Thank you. Hey, you know, I think I should have bee a nurse instead of a lawyer. Ooh, daddy wants to be a nurse. What do you think? Nah. "She usually takes a nap at 1:30. No sugar. No preservatives. No tap water. I packed two changes of clothes, six extra diapers." Six extra diapers. "Vicki is the name of her doll, so if she asks for Vicki, you'll know who she is." Susan, by the time she finishes reading this list, you'll be back to pick her up. So I'm a little anxious about leaving my daughter with a babysitter for the first time. Give me a break, Richard. Mama, you gotta let go sometime. Okay? Hey, I could let go, Richard. Well, then why don't you come back to work again? The firm would love to have you. I bet I could even get you a corner office. With a window? Oh, no. You're not that important yet. You would say that to a former prosecutor? I believe the operative word here is "former." See you later, alligator. Bye. Bye, da-da. I put plenty of bad guys away in my time, and don't you forget it. Okay, now you do everything illiana tells you. You be my big girl. Okay. Okay. All right, I'll be back around 4:00. She's got a doctor's appointment, so I have to be back by then. No worry, Mrs. Rivera. She'll be fine. Come on. Come on. Come on. * * Come here, honey. Okay. Okay, honey. Here we go. Illiana fuster, I'm Susan Maxwell. We spoke on the phone yesterday, and this is Morgan. Oh, how cute. How old she is? 20 months. Mind if I come in and take a look around? Oh, of course, Mrs. Maxwell. Please come in. Here we are. Yes. Look at all the toys. What do we have here? This Rosa, my step-daughter. And this is pretty little April. April, she come every day to stay. Say hi to the baby, April. Hi. You too, Rosa. Hi, baby. Her name's Morgan. Hi, Morgan. She's a handful. You gotta keep a constant eye on her. You have anybody here to help you? No. Don't worry, Mrs. Maxwell. I take good care of the babies. Oh, what do you want to play with? Hi, mommy. Oh, what do you want to play with? You're so pretty. Let's make the door. Okay, here's her bag. If she needs anything, it's in here. I'll be at the country center for a couple hours. If you need me, you can phone me there and they can page me, okay? No problem, Mrs. Maxwell. You're so pretty. * * Kill! Kill! Kill! Hey, ooh, Jason, come on. Knock it off. Come on, none of that monster business, okay? We're here. Let's go. I don't want to go. I thought you liked coming to illiana's. It's just that me and Josh like it better when we stay home with mom. Yeah, honey, I know you do. And I promise that you'll be able to soon, okay? Here we go. Jason, stay right there. Ooh. Boy, you're getting big. Boy, you're getting big. Okay, honey, come on. Here we go. Dad... What? I don't like frank. Frank? Why not? He chases me in the mask. What do you mean? Wait a second. You mean, like, with a Halloween mask? Did he scare you? No, dad. It's okay. I wasn't really scared. Are you sure? Yeah, dad, no big deal. Okay. I'll tell you what I'm going to do, I'll pick you both up for lunch, we'll go to the new house, and we'll have a picnic. How's that? Okay? Okay, dad. Okay. Knock on that door. Knock on that door. Oh, all right, ring the bell. Oh. We have to stop feeding you. Hi. Hi. Hello. Come to me? Oh. It's okay. It's all right, Josh. Thanks. Okay, come on, Jason. Come on. Give me a kiss, honey. Real quick. Come here. Jason. I love you both. I'll see you at lunchtime, okay? Daddy's got to go to work. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Okay, one more set and you guys are history. Hang on just a sec. Let me try this call again. What are you going to do? Call every five minutes? Well, the babysitter's not answering the phone. They never do. Yeah, this one better. Well, make it quick-- we only have the court until 1:00. Good shot! Oh, illiana, finally. This is Mrs. Maxwell. Is everything all right with Morgan? All right, great. Thank you very much. Listen, I'll be there in about an hour. All right, thanks. Bye-bye. It's okay, sweetie. Mommy's here now. Let's go home. Hey, let's hear it for the babysitter. Her highness actually survived for four hours without you. I'm not so sure about that. Why, what's wrong? She says she has a diaper rash. She doesn't get diaper rashes. She probably let her sit around in dirty diapers all day. Hey, not everyone changes diapers every five minutes. Not what I mean. I know. I remember the first day I took Kevin to the babysitter. It gets easier. Come on, let's go have a cup of coffee. No, I want to get her home and see what this rash business is about. It just doesn't seem right. When do we move in? Well, it's not going to be quite as soon as we figured, Jason. Why? Because, honey, we don't have all the money yet. I'm going to have to work one more month. How many days is that? That's 30 days. You promised. But, honey, we'll be moved in by Christmas. You promised no more work. You promised you'd be home. I know, sweetheart. I'm so sorry, but it's only for a little while longer, okay? He'll be okay. Right? He'll be okay. Listen, I gotta get back to work. Can you drop the kids off at illiana's? Thank you. Bye. Bye. Okay. Okay, honey. Okay. Here's your blocks. Here you go. Here you go. Look at this. Look at this. Okay. No, no, no. One, two, three, four, five. Oh, great. No wonder. She hardly changed her. No wonder she's got a rash. Ow. Ouch. Morgan, Morgan. No, no, Morgan. What are you doing? What are you... Mommy. Could be any number of things--bubble bath, tight panties, some sort of irritant. Has she been rubbing herself? Yeah. Why don't you go over there and color? Constantly. Even in front of company. She tries to put things in there too. Why is she doing that? It's not unusual for kids to touch themselves, but this does sound a little extreme. Anything unusual going on that might be upsetting her? No. Well... Yeah, are housekeeper's been on vacation. She's been with crystal since she was born. She's been at a babysitter. That--you know, that's about the time that this started, the rubbing herself, tantrums, and nightmares. She's been wetting the bed. She's been potty trained a long time now. Sounds like a stress reaction to the change of routine. Let's see how she does when the housekeeper gets back. Hey. Maybe I'll take a couple days off before consuelo gets back. Would you like that? Yeah. I think I'd like that too. Not my best game. Come on, what do you say, one more? I can't. I gotta get car pool. Phone call for Jeanne pierson. Oh, what do they want from me now? It's always something. Well, listen, thanks for the game. Okay. Thank you. It was nice meeting you! Bye. Jeanne pierson, phone call. Terri, did they just say, "Jeanne pierson"? I really wasn't listening. I'm sure they said Jeanne pierson. Is that Jeanne pierson? I think so. Why? I've been looking for her. I've been looking for you. I can't believe this. You've been looking for me? Yeah. I wanted to ask you about this babysitter we both use, illiana fuster. What about her? I heard that you had problems, that you stopped sending your son to her. No problems, really. It's just a rumor I heard. What kind of rumor? I really have no reason to believe it's true. What was the rumor? It wouldn't be right to repeat it. Okay. Let's try it this way. I think illiana drugged my baby. Drugged your baby? Yeah. Did you notice if your son seemed a little different when he was going there? No, not really. Just two-year-old stuff. Like what? Like he, uh, he didn't want to take his bath anymore, and when I did finally manage to bathe him, he couldn't wait to get out and get his clothes back on. Is that two-year-old stuff? I asked him if anything happened there and he said no. Why would you ask him if anything had happened there if that's typical two-year-old behavior? Because... Because a friend of mine... Don't ask who. I promised I wouldn't tell. My friend took her three-year-old out because he, uh... Because he kept asking her to kiss his body. And when she asked him what he meant by that, he pointed toward his penis. Well, she didn't think anything of it at first, but then he said... "Illiana kisses all the babies like that." No! No! No! No, don't tell! Don't tell! We're all gonna die! We're all gonna die! I don't know where to go. I don't know who to tell. I'm supposed to know these things, right? Why, because we're parents or because we're lawyers? Just spoke to Gil Lancaster, the mother that recommended illiana. What'd she say? She was real defensive. Said April would have told her if there was a problem. Susan, it's real hard to know what to do. We've only got a rumor we're going on here. It's not just what Jeanne pierson said. It's Morgan. I saw her with my own eyes. Richard, she was drugged. We have to know why. All right. Let's call the state attorney's office in the morning. Ask for an investigation. Okay, babe? Let's do it. Hey. You got a minute? Sure, Christina, what is it? You know that complaint about the babysitter in country walk? Yeah? I talked to some of the parents that use the service. Mm-hmm. Well, what are you getting from 'em? Well, let's just say illiana fuster isn't going to win any awards for child care. These families haven't used the service in months, for one reason or another. What about the kids? Mostly two- and three-year-olds. None of them have been inclined to, like, sit down and give me a statement. Abe, the real problem is this. Any of the parents know about this? Well, if they don't know, they will soon enough. Two of the parents I saw today are cops. Escolona. Francisco fuster. Drop the escolona, we got frank fuster. Homicide in New York City? Aggravated assault. Aggrava-- lewd and lascivious assault on a nine-year-old. Currently on probation. Oh, my god. He's in the house with those little kids. Hello, I'm Tom herschel. Glad you could both make it. Hi, I'm Susan Maxwell. This is my husband, Richard. Hi. Please forgive me if I don't remember your names. There are so many people here. Come on in. You know, it's kind of funny-- we all live in the same neighborhood and we all use the same babysitting service and yet we don't know each other. Served four years for killing a guy in New York and then he moved to Miami. In 1981 he molested a nine-year-old girl. One of his friend's daughters. Then what's he doing in country walk? Why isn't he in jail? Because the judge who put him on probation said he was a respected and respectable member of the community. You can't be serious. No, it gets better. Oh, yeah, hrs-- that's the state licensing agency--they received an anonymous complaint three months ago. Who would file an anonymous complaint? I was responsible for that call. They said they'd check it out. Yeah, well, they did. They walked up, knocked on the door, asked illiana if she was molesting kids. She said no, so they stamped the complaint "unfounded," closed the case. Unfounded? Without making a background check? Without contacting a single family? Without even talking to one child? I didn't know what else to do. I thought that if there really was a problem, that hrs would have them shut down. Well, they didn't. Oh, god. Shari, what is it? What? The last time that I went to pick up Chad, illiana's husband was there with the kids. He said she went to pick up Rosa at the bus stop. Chad came out of the master bedroom in his underwear. Frank said he just changed him and he couldn't find his shorts, but I always roll up the underwear inside the shorts. When I got home, I checked the bag and they were both there right on top where I put them that morning. I keep thinking, "why the underwear and not the shorts?" That was the last time I took him there. If anything would have happened, Chad would have said something, right? Wouldn't he? Let's all just calm down. It's very likely that nothing happened. Our kids would have told us. I know mine would have. They would have said something. I'm Jackie Harrison and this is my husband, Neil. An investigator from the state attorney's office just left our house. She was talking to our son. She said she was going to be calling tomorrow about bringing some of the children downtown. For what? To be interviewed. Excuse me, how the hell do you interview a four-year-old child? And a lot of you, you have infants. Who's going to speak for them? Mm-hmm. Well, it's my luck. I have the only office with carpeting, so I get dispossessed. Yeah. Uh, don't worry. I'll let you know where you can reach me. Yeah. Bye-bye. Abe. Abe. These are the psychologists, Dr. Laurie Braga, Dr. Joseph Braga. How do you do? Both professors at the university of Miami medical school. This is Abe laeser, chief assistant state attorney. You'll be using his office. Right. My boss, Janet Reno, wanted you brought in because she said that you speak good three-year-old. What is that supposed to mean? Well, for example, if you ask a three-year-old if anything happened in his presence, he'll probably start looking around for packages to unwrap. Oh. Yeah, I see your point. Sorry, ma'am. I hope you don't mind our preempting your office like this. Hey, because of the carpet they said. For the kids to sit on. For us too. Oh. Well, what would you like to know about the case? Nothing now. Let us interview the children first. You know, I don't think it's a very good idea to be videotaping these kids. Mr. Laeser, anything that spares these children from repeated interviews by social workers, police, and prosecutors is a good idea. I understand. It's just that children can be so inconsistent. These tapes might backfire on us. What an adult considers inconsistent is often perfectly consistent with a child's level of development. Oh, like what? Like just because a four-year-old can't tell you exactly when or how many times, doesn't mean the what didn't happen. These tapes will protect the children. That's why we do it. Exactly. Yeah. All right, the technicians will be back there with the monitor. Thanks, Mr. Laeser. Please, call me Abe. Abe. We'd like the parents to watch the interviews, so would you please have them sit in there with the technicians? Sure. Excuse me, the camera's already set. Would you just turn it on, please? We're ready for the first child. Oh. Jason Harrison. That's his name. I'll get him. Thank you. Do you know how old he is? No. That wasn't too long, huh? Come on. You're first. Hi. I'm Joe. This is Laurie. And I'll bet you're...Jason. Right? Yeah. I am. Great. Jason, did you ever see a truck like this? No. It's pretty neat. Would you like to come over and play with it? Come on. You can see it opens up. That's really a neat truck. Oh...headlights. Do you know why you came here today? We're just having trouble with the babysitter. Does it make you sad to talk about that? No. It's just that... I discussed about it with the lady yesterday, and I don't want to talk about it again. I can understand that. It's kind of a hard thing to talk about. These yellow things must go in here. I'm worried about missy. Can't get it out of my head. I keep thinking-- shari, will you please stop? We keep going over and over the same thing. She told the investigator nothing happened, so just let it go. For god's sake, she was only there twice. And frank was there. She told Christina that, too, that he took her into the den to watch a movie. Just-- she never told us that. What else hasn't she told us? Shari, give it a rest. I can't. Come on, we've got enough to worry about with Chad. Why we were wondering if you would talk to us is because we wanted to talk to Josh. He's so little. It's kind of hard to talk to him. So I thought maybe you could help. My brother does talk. Like, if you asked him "what do frank and illiana do," he would say it. He would? He would. Seems so relieved to be talking about it. I know how my brother would do it. Like, if you asked him a question. Uh-huh? He would say illiana's playing with his penis, and it's not very good. The fusters already know they're being investigated. They've been calling the parents. No! No. One of your caseworkers will not look into it tomorrow. At least get a temporary injunction. I want that babysitting service shut down. Now. They play ring around the rosy. And how do they play ring around the rosy? They play it dumb. They dress up naked and play it. They take all their clothes off and play it. Hmm. Who would take off their clothes? Both the girls and boys. Oh. And then what would happen? They play ring around the rosy. Could you show us with these dolls, 'cause I don't know how to play it. Do you want me to hold their hands and help you? There, we'll hold these. Illiana would just undress on the couch. Okay, I'll tell you what, let's make this illiana, okay? And would you show me what happened? She just took off all her clothes and everybody else took them off. * * Frank was in the game too. He's not talking about himself at this point. He's more comfortable talking about what he saw than what he did. How do you know that anything happened to him? Well, we don't for sure, but he knows a lot more detail than you would expect if he were just watching. And every now and then he would say something like, "I didn't like it." Why didn't he tell us? Kids don't usually run home and tell their parents. They're afraid that what happened to them is their fault, and when they do finally get up the nerve to tell, they do it in stages, a little bit at a time until they're sure it's safe. What do you mean "safe"? Are you saying that he was threatened? That's not the kind of safety I'm talking about, but, yes, it's possible that Jason was threatened. Every time he got close to talking about threats, he'd clam up. The children usually save the worst for last. So he may still be too scared to talk about it. Neil, now, I understand that you're angry, and you have every right to be. If you need to go someplace and just scream your heart out, do it, do it, but it is crucial that Jason doesn't think you're angry at him. No matter what you're feeling, when you're with Jason, you're going to have to do the best acting job of your life so that he can start to feel safe again--safe enough to talk to you about this. Hi, dad. Hi, honey. Oh, come here. Oh. You're a very, very brave little boy, you know that, honey? Dad. Mommy and daddy love you very much. Bobby. Yes, Mr. Laeser? See if Christina's gotten a hold of frank luster's probation officer yet. Yes, sir. I just got off the phone with him. Oh. Well, what'd he have to say about his lewd and lascivious client running a babysitting service out of his house? He says he knows. He gave him permission to. He what? Doesn't he realize frank works out of the house? He says he saw no problem with it because illiana would be doing all the babysitting. All right, come on, get the boxes from the garage. * * What about the "get me" game? Could you tell me about that? They would do this, and then they would bite their private parts. Who would do it to who? Frank would do it to Chad. What about... What would happen to April? April? They would do right here and right there. Who would? Frank. With his hands? Yeah. With his hands. And illiana would do this. To who? To Tommy. They played other games, too. Like what? The caca game. Come on! Load it up in the back! Come on. Come on. Jason, let me ask you a question. You know what a camera is, right? Yeah. Yeah. Did anybody ever take any pictures? Yeah. Who? Who took the pictures? Frank. Did he? Did he have a camera? Yes. How big? As big as that one over there. Was the camera like this? No. A camera like that one over there. I want those tapes. Do you think you can establish that Jason has seen them in the fuster house in the last 30 days? A five-year-old doesn't understand the concept of a period of time like 30 days. But if we relate the questions to something concrete, something the parents tell us happened during that time, sure. Why is it so important? Because it's the only way I can get a search warrant. I can see that we're in for a crash course in the finer points in evidence gathering. I'll make a deal with you. Teach me about children. I'll teach you about the law. I've got a couple of books right in here. Excuse me. You okay? It's just starting to sink in. I had to be there for the kids. I couldn't let them see how I was feeling. Makes me sick. Just makes me sick. I know. This goes so far beyond anything we've ever seen or heard. Group sex with children. And the other stuff. Oh, i-- where is this coming from? This is something... So evil. So dark. I know. I have the same feeling-- darkness. There is something so terribly wrong here. This is beyond imagination. We came here to interview a few kids, and now we're in the middle of a nightmare. What have we gotten ourselves into? I'll talk to you later. Go on! * * get in the house, Rosa. Maggie? I'm so sorry. How could we not have known? Why didn't she tell us? She was threatened. I think she was trying to protect you. I'm her mother. I'm supposed to protect her. What's going to happen now? How am I ever going to be able to let her out of my sight again? Most people who take care of children do it because they care, not because they want to hurt them. You know, I talked to the other parents and there were signs, but it was like we were all holding different pieces of a puzzle and we didn't know what they meant. That's the point. All you had were the pieces; nobody had the whole picture. None of you did. How am I supposed to deal with this? How am I supposed to deal with her? You can't change what happened. But you can help her heal. She's already taken the first step by telling this secret, and that's a burden she doesn't have to bear anymore. She doesn't talk to me about it. I think she will in her own time, in her own way. Don't pressure her, but let her know you're there if there's anything she wants to tell you. Most important thing for her to know is that she didn't do anything wrong. I know. But you see, my husband and I are both police officers and we never thought anything like this could ever happen. And it hurts. It really hurts. I understand. All right, we'll talk about that later. Michael. Thanks for coming on such short notice. This is Mr. Fuster and his wife, illiana. This is Mr. Von zamft, the lawyer I told you about. Ah, ah, ah. I do nothing. I do absolutely nothing, and now people come say, "you are a child molester." I mean, the worst crime a human being can commit. How can I molest a child if I'm not in the house? I don't know why people say these things. Tell Mr. Von zamft something. Do I know these children? Am I in the house? No, he's not in the house. Mr. Fuster, i-- you see, I am innocent. I don't care. But I am 100% innocent of these allegations. Ask Mr. Samek. Mr. Samek, he knows. He tried to help me last year, but no. They no give me new trial. The judge puts me on probation for molesting a little girl. Only god knows why she tells these lies on me. Frank, we can talk about this later. The judge is waiting. You know-- you know why this happens? An accident. 1969 New York, I tried to make citizen's arrest. The bad driver, he makes me shoot him. Now, they make me plead guilty to murder. If this is justice, no. But now they make witch hunt against me, but, you see, they do this all over the country. I know; I read the newspapers. On the word of a child. A child? Please, I am innocent. You must believe me. It's not my job to believe you. It's my job to get you off. I want to know what I'm dealing with so I can figure out how. No, no, but you must believe. I mean, where's the evidence? The search my house for videotapes; They don't find videotapes. Frank, I said that we can talk about this later. Right now it's time to surrender yourself to the judge. Jeffrey, since when do you need my help with a routine probation violation? There's a lot more to it than that, Michael. Here they are. Let's go. All right. Come on. Let's get through it. Excuse us, please. Please, no. John hogan will lead the team. He's chief of felonies and he's a genius when it comes to organization, which is exactly what we need in a case this size. And he's also not lost a case in five years now. Oh, you're talking about me again, huh, Abe? Uh, no. Meet Dan Casey. This pup has already made it to chief of robbery, so you know he's good. Hi, I'm John hogan. Laurie Braga. It's a privilege to meet both of you. I've seen some of your interviews. I never realized you could have such small children remember so many details. Kids can do a lot more than most people give them credit for. This is our case on the wall over here. We've been sorting through the tapes trying to organize the charges. Yeah, we've taken statements on more than 500 counts now. And that's even more than they had in the mcmartin case. We're going to learn from their mistakes. We're going to limit the charges to just a couple of dozen counts, the ones that have the strongest cross-corroboration among the children. Yeah, for example, in Jason's sexual battery counts, the oral copulation, we have what he told you and his parents and what we got from the Martinez girl in taped interviews. But Abe told us the tapes aren't admissible in court. They're not. Neither are the statements they're making to their parents. That's all considered hearsay. But this helps us to know where their corroboration is so we know who to concentrate on to testify at trial. And actually it's not all that hard to narrow down. We've got about 30 kids, most of them babies and toddlers and one definite-- Jason. That leaves about a dozen maybes. Will they remember by the time they get to trial? Unfortunately these children will remember this for the rest of their lives. No, I told you-- it's a surprise. You'll just have to wait and see. Well? Welcome to the state attorney center for children. Janet Reno figured since you wouldn't accept any money for doing this, she could at least give you a decent place to interview these kids. Well, say something. I can't believe it. I know. They've been working all night. But the furniture won't be in till later on this afternoon. So you think you can handle one more day on Abe's floor? I think so. Great. And how many kids do we have today? Frank fuster's daughter, Rosa. Come on. She's waiting downstairs. I'll go get her. Does it upset you to talk about this? I just want to forget about it. I remember, but I don't want to remember. I was wondering, if you could say anything to your father about what happened which you think he ought to know, what would you tell him? I would tell him, "I know why now." Why what? Why he did those things. Why do you think, Rosa? 'Cause he thought the kids were not going to tell, and they did tell. Mm-hmm. Are you mad at him? I'm sad for him. Could you tell me who this is? I drew that because I was scared of illiana. She had a knife. And she made me do things. * * who's this? This is me. Bop. So shiny, isn't it? All right, we got Rosa fuster's test results back from rape treatment center. She tested positive for gonorrhea of the throat. Frank fuster's daughter? Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. All the other children came back negative. Parents talked a lot about the kids being sick. A lot of antibiotics for throat infection. I want you to give me all the kids' medical records. The pediatricians may have been treating the kids for gonorrhea and never even knew it. You got it. See, now with this and Rosa's testimony... No. You cannot use Rosa. Laurie, this is the only solid physical evidence we have. No, it's not. We have some other kids with physical signs, vaginal adhesions, rectal-- yeah, but that could be because of the sexual abuse or something else. What Rosa's got could only be contracted in one way. I understand what you're saying. You cannot put Rosa on the stand. Why not? Because frank fuster may be her father, but he's the only father she's got. She loves him. Yeah, but that's true of almost every incest case. What makes this one so special? Well, if i-- when illiana took-- when illiana took Rosa to visit frank in jail, he terrified her by telling her she was the only one who could save him. She believes that. You can't... You can't use her to put him away. It would destroy her. What about this case? Well, we have an agreement, John. If it's the case or the child, the child wins. Okay. Please, we have no comments at this time. Excuse us. Ah! Let her through, please. Illiana fuster surrendered today to authorities two weeks after her husband's arrest. The two are accused of molesting children who attended a babysitting service in their home. Mrs. Fuster is 17 years old and is an illegal alien from Honduras. 17? She told me she was 23. What's the difference as long as she's off the streets and they're both in jail? They'll get out. No, they won't, Jason. They can't. Mr. Laeser will see to that. Illiana can get out. She's got special powers. What is that, Jason? What are you drawing? Death, I love you. You gave me the grateful gifts. Take this bird with you and take all your children up to hell with you. We don't love the children 'cause they are a gift of god. We want the children to be hurt. Amen. Where'd you learn that, honey? Illiana taught me. That's the prayer she says before she kills the birds. Mommy! Monsters, mommy, daddy! Monsters! Mommy, daddy! Mommy! What's the matter? Did you have a bad dream, honey? It's okay. You didn't come. I cried. You didn't come. Monsters, I told you. Oh, sweetheart, I didn't know you meant frank and illiana. Mommy and daddy didn't know. We never would have left you there. Hey, hey. I got him. Hey, hey. Hey, Chad, what's the matter, baby? Don't touch me. Oh... We've got to do something, Tom. I'll call the bragas. Come on, sweetheart. Let's go back to bed, okay? We're going to go to sleep now. I love you. I love you. Mr. Hogan, what's your response to these allegations? What allegations? These allegations. The fusters' lawyers say they want a special prosecutor appointed to investigate the relationship between the bragas and the state attorney's office. It looks to me like they're saying there might be some kind of conspiracy. What conspiracy? To create a nightmare? Excuse me. Defense says that the bragas are frauds. They say that they have proof that Dr. Joseph Braga who taught at Boston university died in 1972. Mr. Hogan, if the real Dr. Braga is dead, who are the people who've got interviewing the children? Tracy, get me the bragas! I think they're in the interview room. What in the world's the matter with you? Trouble. Give me a break, will you, please? I can't believe they would do this. Why not? It makes perfect sense to me. The press is chewing their clients up. I mean, convicted child molester, convicted killer, gonorrhea. This just takes the heat off them for a little while. Obviously they had to create a diversion, huh? Don't you think that killing Joe Braga is a little extreme? No, no, it just proves that our friends old Jeffrey and Michael have been doing their homework. Attacking the interviewer is exactly the same tactic that the defense took in Jordan, Minnesota, and in the mcmartin case. It's true. You taint the bragas, you taint this case, because all these kids have in common are the fusters and the people who interviewed them. John, what is it? Do you need us? You know, I don't see what you could possibly find amusing about this. John, I mean, the defense must be pretty desperate if the only way they can get the fusters off is to declare me dead. I mean, I am not now, nor have I ever been dead. Well, the boy's a little pale, but you're right. He's definitely not dead. Listen, I want to remind you folks that discrediting witnesses may be standard defense tactics, but it is one that works. We have endured subpoenas, hearings, depositions, nonstop harassment for months on end. Everything from dead chickens on our doorsteps to the defense attorneys on the news telling us that this horror isn't real. I wish that were true, but then again the truth isn't their job, or so Michael Von zamft says. Michael's just going to love this. I think he's been counting on them to pull out of this case. Yeah, well, I think Michael's met his match in Maggie Rivera. Every molester that is freed by an unfair system, there will be 100 more child victims. One of those could be your child or your grandchild. We won't stand for this senseless carnage. This weekend, members or our organization, justice for sexually abused children, will launch a petition drive seeking public support for the most comprehensive child protection laws ever introduced into legislation in this nation. We want laws that will protect our children in court the way the child abusers are protected now. We want justice for sexually abused children. "Fred shouted back and jan turned and ran outside. That was always the way it went. First his father and brother would play chess, and then all of a sudden..." Mommy... What, sweetheart? Do you love me? Well, of course I do. No matter what? Nothing could ever stop me. I have something to tell you. Well, why don't you come up here and tell me? No. Okay. Tell me the great big old secret from down there. It's about frank and illiana. Jason... Do still want me to tell Dr. Joe about what you said last night? I didn't do it. Chad did it. Jason, I know it was you, because you told me. You can tell me anything. Frank said he would kill us if I told. That is not true. You are always safe with us. Please remember that, baby. But I'm ashamed. I did it too. But, Jason, it's not your fault. Frank and illiana made you do it. Is Rosa in jail too? Oh, no, of course not, honey. She's a little child just like you. But she did it too. Children do what their parents make them do. You still love me, mom? Oh, honey, I love you bigger than the universe. Oh. Yes. In addition, your honor, Boston university has confirmed that the information in their computer's listing Dr. Braga as deceased was an error. They say that the entry was a recent one and cannot explain how it got there. Now, I don't know in today's society if there's anything that's 100% certain, but I am 99.99% sure that that man right there is Joseph Lynn Braga, and unless I'm mistaken, your honor, I don't think he's dead. I'd like to think that this matter has been put to rest. Welcome back to the land of the living, doctor. It's over. Now go after the kids now. Jason, why don't you sit right here? Jason, my name is Jeff. I know. You know? How do you know? My mother told me. Your mother told you? You've been saying a lot of things about frank and illiana, haven't you? Yeah. I'm frank's friend, and I want to help frank, and I think you're lying. No. I don't think the things that you've been saying about frank are true. Do you know what a lie is? Yes. What's a lie? When you... I don't know. No, look at me. You know what a lie is. What's a lie? When you do something... When you say something, it's not true. Okay, that's right. That's exactly what a lie is. I think you've been lying to me about frank and illiana. I don't think frank ever did anything to you. Frank didn't do anything to you, did he? Yes, he did. Frank never put his mouth on your penis, did he? Yes, he did. When did he do it? Partially. What? Partially. Jason, look at me when you answer. I think we should take a break now. Fine, stop the tape and let the judge come up and see it. Hi, sweetheart. Oh, god. I thought he wanted the truth. Will you explain that, Mr. Samek? I believe that the repeated interrogations of this boy by the state investigators has put him under a spell. And you're trying to break the spell by breaking the child? Dr. Ralph underwager, the expert that I've engaged to assist in Mr. Fuster's defense has advised me that the bragas have woven a spell around the children. He says the spell must be forcibly broken. After seeing the tape, I think that is about as disingenuous as anything I have ever seen. Personally, I will supply a transcript of this deposition to the Florida bar. I was looking to see how he would react. You want to see how he'll react when he's called a liar, and you believe that is the purpose of a discovery deposition? You wouldn't be able to call him a liar in a courtroom, would you? You want to conduct yourself in such a manner that he'll not be able to testify against your client at all. I want the boy to tell the truth. But you already know what the truth is, don't you, Mr. Samek? Now, Dr. Underwager, what would be the average number of words a three-year-old would be expected to understand? I don't know. How about to speak? I don't know. You know of any study that has been in this area? Not offhand. Could you explain what changes take place in language development in children between the ages of two and three? Not right now. Is there any difference in your mind between the age in which a child distinguishes between truth and falsehood and when they begin to realize the impropriety of telling falsehoods? Hmm, approximately puberty. Some a bit before that. Okay. Would you in any way compare the techniques used by the bragas in the case with those used by the red Chinese, north Koreans, or north vietnamese? That is certainly a comparison could be made. Tell me how the Chinese would program someone. I can't. So which techniques of the red Chinese, north Koreans, or north vietnamese or other tyrants were used by the bragas? I can't say right now. Can you tell me any? Hi, crystal. Here it is. Now, it's a big room, but it's kind of a nice room, isn't it? Yeah. All right. Now... Go right there. Over here is where the jury sits. All right, now, the jury has to listen to everything that everybody says, and the judge, look here, the judge is going to be sitting in that big blue chair right up there. Okay. Okay. Think you can get up in that chair by yourself? I think I can. Will frank and illiana be here? Yeah, they'll be there but you don't even have to look at them. You just talk to me, talk to their lawyers, and you can talk to the judge over there. Now, you're going to be right here. Where do you want me to be? Right here. Okay. That's where I'll be then. Now, I want to try something, crystal. I'm going to need your mom to help me. All right, uh, come on, you be me, your mom's going to be me, and I'm going to go over here to this table where frank's lawyer Mr. Samek is, okay? Okay. Now, Maggie, you ask crystal a question, why don't you? What kind of question? Make it an easy one. Okay. Crystal, when's your birthday? July 20-- objection! Hearsay! No foundation! Dan. He's just pretending. Now, that was kind of silly, wasn't it, crystal? Hmm? Mm-hmm. Now, you know why that happened? 'Cause I said something wrong? No, crystal, you didn't say anything wrong. That's something that lawyers do to get you to stop talking so they can talk to the judge. And I have a feeling they're going to want to talk to the judge a lot. Do I get to talk to the judge? Yeah. Yeah, you do. The judge might ask you a question. For example, if I said your name is Mary, is that the truth or a lie? That's a lie. Good. Good, crystal. And that's all there is to it. I gotta go. Good-bye. Bye. Any more questions? Yeah, why is the roof so high? I'm going to look into that. You're on your own. That's what I was afraid of. Bye, cookie. Bye, mom. Daddy will pick you up in a half hour. All right, crystal. Are we going to be all right? How's she doing? She's determined to do this. I just don't know what's going to happen when she comes face to face with him in open court. I'm late. Well, she may not have to, at least not in person. Judge Newman may let 'em testify on closed circuit TV. It's a new law, but I think we can use it. Still, we should have at least one child testify in open court. I think it'll be missy herschel. What about the kids' interviews tapes? Can we get those into evidence too? Yeah, well, we're not even going to try. Wait-- what are you talking about? 50,000 petitions, three months of lobbying in the house and the senate. John, we killed ourselves to get those tapes in front of a jury and you're not even going to try? It's too risky. That law has never been tested. If judge Newman lets a jury see those tapes and appeals court says he shouldn't have, the fusters will walk. Yeah, well, they may walk anyway. The defense says the bragas brainwashed the kids and now you're telling me that the jury isn't going to have the chance to see for themselves how the interviews were done so that they'll never know. There's a lot of things this jury will never know. They won't even know he was a convicted child molester. Then all of this was for nothing. No. No, it wasn't for nothing. The laws are on the books now. You didn't do this just for your children. You did it for everybody's children. You know, I spent more than a year trying to understand why the fusters did this to our kids. They did it because they were sick. No. They did it because they could. It's not fair. It's not a fair fight. Has anyone forced or threatened you in any way to enter this plea this morning? No, your honor, no. Has anyone promised you anything to enter this plea this morning? No, they have not... That's a mistake we didn't make. Do you understand that there is a possibility you could be sentenced to as much as life in the state penitentiary for these crimes? Do you understand that? Yes, but I am not pleading guilty because I feel guilty or because I think I have criminal mind. I can give you as much as life or as little as I so choose at the time of sentencing. I want to make sure you understand that. Yes. Howard, get a picture. Yes, there she goes. Mr. Hogan, were you surprised by Mrs. Fuster's guilty plea? Nothing surprises me about this case anymore. Does this mean that she'll testify? No, she wouldn't agree to testify. She wouldn't make a deal. She's thrown herself on the mercy of the court. Thank you. John, what the hell's going on? Why didn't she take a deal? I don't know. We offered her 17 years. I guess Von zamft figures he can do better with judge Newman. She's so young. So what? She was doing this stuff when frank wasn't even there. Yeah, but judge Newman doesn't know that. Now he probably never will. So now it's just the kids. It's just the kids. Their word against frank's. Now that the court has been cleared, I want to reiterate that the face of this witness may not be photographed. This rule shall also apply to the children who will be testifying on closed circuit TV from my chambers. Is that clear? Thank you, judge. The state calls missy herschel. Mom. It's okay, honey. Just let me go first, okay? You want to go right up to that box, right up there, all right? Okay. Climb right up there. Very good. Okay? Mom's going to be right behind you, okay? Is that good? Okay. Ready? Okay. Do you want to look at this book? No? Is my sister still in there? Yeah. Hey, champ. Hey, come to daddy. Come on. Oh, gosh, you're a big boy. How're you doing? You feeling ready? Mm-hmm. Come here. Look at daddy. Mommy's going to be there, you know, right? And all John's going to ask you is what your name is and how old you are, all right? That's all you have to tell the jury. Okay. Okay, now, the second time that you went to frank and illiana's, did something happen? Yes. Did you play games? Yes. And what was the name of the game? "Cut your head off." How do you play "cut your head off"? Frank chases everybody. Missy, could you speak up just a little bit? Frank chases everybody. And what happened? He'd say... He put a knife up to your neck. I have no more questions, your honor. Missy, I'm feeling a little bit tired today. Is it okay if I sit down and talk with you? That's okay. Thanks. Oh, boy. Missy, um, at school, did they ever tell you about good touching and bad touching? Yes. Do you know what good touching and bad touching is? Yes. Do you remember that you told the police officer that frank never touched you in a bad way? He did touch me in a bad way. Missy, um, don't you remember that you told the police lady that frank didn't you touch in a bad way? Don't you remember that? What's this, missy? That's my seal. Is that a boy seal or a girl seal? It's a girl seal. Missy, just one more question, okay? Now, when frank touched you in a bad way, the second time, why didn't you just go home and tell your mom and dad right away? I was afraid. I have no more questions, your honor. Now, Jason, you were two when you started going to frank and illiana's, right? No, I was four. Do you know how old stephie was when she went to frank's? No. Is she older than you? About the same age, four. When did frank tell you how to kill the octopus? What octopus? The octopus. Frank told how to kill the octopus, didn't he? No, he didn't. Okay, just give me a minute to look at my notes. My notes are a little confusing. Jason, frank didn't say anything when he wore the masks, did he? He just wore the mask and turned off the lights. He wore the mask, turned off the lights, and scared people. What would he do? He would tell they are going to die. What about the devil that came out of the toilet? They told us about that. Tell me about that. They would say every time they flushed the toilet, they would come out. Now, the pills you told me about, what did they look like? Like little tablets. What color were they? I don't remember. Did you take the medicine? I didn't. Sometimes. All right, no further questions. Redirect. Now, Jason, is there anything else that happened there that you think you'd like to tell the judge? About the babies. Okay, what about the babies? They would... Like, they would make them watch her naked games. Anything else about the babies? No. Now, did you ever do anything with the babies? Yes. Hi, sweetheart. Hi. I told them, mom. I told them everything. I bet you did a good job. How do you feel? Great. Is it over? Almost, Jason. Almost. Now, the mask that frank was wearing was purple. White! And even though it didn't have any eyes, he could still see through it. It did have eyes! Do you know if illiana was wearing the blue mask or did illiana wear the blue mask? She wore the red mask. I can see frank. Yeah, what's he doing? I think he's crying. What? Well, while he's doing this. Then maybe he's got a headache, too. What happens now? Well, now that the kids have told what happened, samek will try and convince a jury that nothing happened. How could he do that after what they've heard? We have to understand, a jury would rather believe anything than believe that frank fuster raped 50 kids for a year and not one of them told. All right, judge, the defense will open its case by introducing into evidence the taped interviews of the children conducted by doctors Joseph and Laurie Braga. All of them. The tapes will be received in evidence without objection. Has samek lost his mind? He knows what's on those tapes. Well, we've always known he could use them even if we couldn't. I just thought he'd just assumed put frank on the stand and have him make a full confession. No, you know what he's doing? He figures we're going to take advantage of the new law and try to introduce them into rebuttal. He just wants to beat us to it. You know, there are 60 hours of taped interviews. Maybe he thinks this jury is going to lose interest. Yeah. Maybe he's been brainwashed by his own expert. How about the "get me" game? Can you tell me about that? They would do right here and then right there. Who would do that? Frank. With his hands? Yeah, with his hands. And illiana would do this. They played other games, too. Like what? The caca game. Dr. Coleman, you've testified for the defense that you thought the parents in this case like to hear sexy stuff. Is that correct? Mr. Hogan, what I was saying was that I believe the parents have been victimized as much as the children by the interviewing methods. Now, that's not what you said on August 14th, page 303, and I quote, "the evidence on the tape is the parents and the bragas like to hear sexy stuff. They had been told repeatedly, 'we are so proud of you when you talk about these things. We wish you would talk about these things.'" what I was saying is that the... That seemed to be the information the bragas and the parents seemed to want to hear. Yeah, in fact in every case that you've ever consulted with, you've never seen an interview that you thought was well-done. That's true. I have never seen a videotaped interview that did not show essentially the same kind of manipulative leading, biased techniques. Or, in other words, you've never been paid $1,500 a day by anyone that you didn't conclude that the tapes were not well-done. I think that is a vicious distortion. I could form the opposite conclusion and get paid money, too. Oh, well, now, Dr. Coleman, you might have a problem with that. Why would someone pick you with six months experience in the area of child sex abuse to testify when all the leaders in the area are on the other side? Hey. Illiana wants to testify. I'm sorry? It's a little late for that. She's already pleaded guilty. No deal. No deal. She doesn't want a deal. Illiana wants to testify-- I don't want her, and I don't need her. The children have already told the jury everything it needs to hear. Listen, Abe says that an adult witness can protect this case on appeal. What an insult to the children that is. The idea that one adult testimony carries more weight than dozens of children. I know, I know. You know that's the way it is. Frank would carry them or just be near sometimes. He would take them in a separate room. Which child did you see frank take into a separate room? Andy pierson. And did there ever actually come a time when you saw the defendant kissing the naked body of a child? That was the time when I went into Rosa's room and frank was there. And where was Andy? Andy was... Was laying on the bed, and he was naked. And frank was kissing his body. You are a liar! You are a liar! God is going to punish you for this! Mr. Fuster, I will have you gagged and locked to your chair! Liar! You are a liar! God is going to punish you! Mr. Samek, explain to your client. Judge, the jury. Bailiff, escort the jury to the jury room. Daddy, why didn't the jury make up its mind yet? Well, honey, they have a lot on their minds, and I'm sure that they're going to make up their mind tomorrow. Don't cry. I'm not crying, honey. I'm just thinking about how much I love you. I love you too, daddy. I know you do. I promise you something, crystal. What? You will never, ever have to see frank and illiana again, okay? Okay. Good night, honey. Good night. Hey. You okay? Yeah. Yeah. What's going to happen? What are we going to do if they don't convict? They'll convict. But what if they don't? They have to. You know juries are funny sometimes, honey. They will. They have to. I think we should call. Joseph? Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to remind you that this is a court of law, and you're expected to conduct yourselves accordingly. There will be no outburst when the verdict is read, or I will clear the court. The clerk will read the verdict. We, the jury, at Miami-dade county, Florida, the second day of October a.D., 1985, find the defendant Francisco fuster escolona as to sexual battery upon Jason Harrison as charged in count one of the information: Guilty.

As charged in count 12 of the information: Guilty. So say we all. * * * * There are 7 million children in daycare in the United States and more than 1/4 million licensed daycare centers.
