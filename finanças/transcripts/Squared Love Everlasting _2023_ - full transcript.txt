God alone knows when it'll happen, but when it does, your life will briefly resemble a romantic comedy. Like this one. - [bell dinging] - [Enzo grunting] [Monika chuckling] [Enzo] Monika said yes once already, but I wanted to do it again, the right way, with no cameras, fans, and millions of people watching. [kids clamoring] [Enzo] My first plan failed.

ELEMENTARY SCHOOL NR 418 I'd like to ask that the teachers stay a little longer, if that's okay. Uh, the kids can go, though. There's one more thing to address, which I believe is the most significant. [inhaling] I'd like to welcome the reporters. Don't be afraid to get closer. [man] Uh, wait a minute. [woman] Come on. Over here. This one, yes. Nice smile. This press conference, in some ways, um, marks the end of an era, if you will. - [cameras clicking] - [principal] I've made a decision. Yes. But please, guys, don't try to stop me, heaven forbid. I'll just... I'll be enjoying a well-deserved retirement. [crowd gasping] And Ms. Grabarczyk is going to take my place. - [crowd applauding] - [principal] Let's congratulate her. Ms. Monika, please do not forget that this is my school and I'll be keeping an eye on you. [man] Over here... And vice versa. [crowd laughing] There! Brief and to the point. Isn't she sweet? - What an improvement. - Yeah. [man laughing] As the new principal, um... My ambition is to move our school into the twenty-first century. New ways of thinking and acting. I'll be honest. I never felt so prepared for anything. [crowd murmuring] [camera shutters clicking] [Monika groaning] [crowd gasping] [light, upbeat music playing] [Enzo sighing] - Maybe she ate something. - Sir? Excuse me. How long should we play? Because we didn't get paid yet. - Here you go. - Has Monika been behaving weirdly lately? Weirdly how? [Andrzej] Has she been irritable? Did she recently go to a party? - Has she slept more? - [Enzo] Maybe it's stress? Or food poisoning. Or could be exhaustion. Yeah, but... - She could also be pregnant? - Nah... Really? [dog barking] [Enzo sighing] So, does that mean you're, uh... Uh, yeah. I don't know. I think it's possible. But when? [Enzo sighing] I'm sorry, it doesn't matter. [breathing heavily] What matters is the present moment. - Wha... what are you doing? - [Enzo] Nothing. Nothing. [grunting] [upbeat piano music playing] [Enzo breathing heavily] [object clattering] ♪ Didn't take very long ♪ [Monika chuckling] Will you marry me, Monika?

[chuckling] - [Enzo sighing] [Monika moaning] - [Enzo moaning] - [Monika laughing] - [car horn honking] - [Enzo grunting] I can't imagine having anybody else serve as my best man as I stand at the altar. [Enzo panting] What, you wanna get married in a church? Of course, yeah. You do know that you're gonna need a baptism or a confirmation certificate for that, right? Of course I know that. What's your point? So where do you get a certificate like that? - In a church. - [Andrzej] Mm-hmm. You'll come with me to our old parish and then... Oh no. [Enzo groaning] [both] Father Wiktor. Uncle Wiktor. - [Enzo sighing] - You think he still works there? [whimsical music playing] [cell phone chiming] ST. MARTHA'S CHURCH FATHER WIKTOR WILL TAKE PART IN AN ONLINE COURSE... No. Don't look at me like that, man! Andrzej. - I'm not coming with you anywhere. - Hey! No way. Andrzej! You refuse to see your uncle? [indistinct chatter] [teacher chuckling] Sit down. Sit down. So, listen. Uh, I'm not gonna take up too much of your time. I'm very glad we're working together. We know each other well. That's why I'd rather help you in fixing problems Rather than create new ones, of course. And if you have any questions, uh, obviously... When can we expect training in regards to the new update of the e-gradebook? Well, you should ask Ms. Basia about that. She's on maternity leave. Oh, so in that case, I'll take care of it this week. [teacher 2] Hmm. I've submitted changes to the lesson schedule, but they weren't applied. You should go to the secretary's office and speak with Natalia. Natalia is giving birth tomorrow. That's right. Natalia's giving birth. Uh, in that case, I'll apply these changes myself. If you have any other questions, feel free to... [bell ringing] Okay, so I'll keep an eye out for any updates.

Here's your orange juice. You look pale. Are you feeling well? [Monika] Mm-hmm. You don't seem to be very happy. No, I'm happy. It's just I'm surprised by this news. That's all there is to it. [Bazyli sighing] And how are you doing? I'm doing well. My son actually flew in from Chicago. Will you join us for dinner? - Of course. Yes. - Fabulous. I'm glad you're coming.

I've made meat patty cutlets just for you. - I'm sure you missed Polish cuisine. - [Monika] No. I'm good, thank you. [chuckling] Right, right. I mean, uh, Chanise and I avoid eating meat as much as we can. Mmm. I'm sure your wife is a wonderful cook. Our nanny prepares the food. Chanise went back to work. [Aleksandra] Hmm. And how are the children? Very good. They're really great. We're blessed. And we're seriously, um, considering homeschooling. [Aleksandra inhaling] Hmm. Monika is a teacher. - And the school's principal. - [Monika chuckling] Oh! - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Enzo, what do you do for a living? - I work with cars. So you're partners with Bazyli? No, no. Enzo Has his own... We do work together. [man] Mm-hmm. Okay. [chickens clucking] As for me, I was offered a promotion too. Data analysis in project management for a large auditing company in San Francisco. Wow. Kind of like an accountant? [Bazyli chuckling] Congratulations, honey. Let's drink to that. This is why we have to move to the West Coast. And Mom, maybe this would be a good moment for you to join us. [Aleksandra] Hmm. We'll think about it. We'll think about it. [birds chirping] [Aleksandra] Strawberries were gone first. No wonder. [Bazyli] Do you want some coffee? I know where to find coffee in this house. Sit down for a moment, please. Let's cut to the chase. We're selling the house, and Mom will join us in the States, hmm? That's always been our plan. Instead of doing nothing here anyway, and she can help us with the kids. It's every grandma's dream. [tense music playing] But, I don't think that has been decided yet, right? Ola hasn't made her decision yet. [man] Do you really think I don't know what you're playing at? My mom has plenty of money. And you, um, are using her. Unless, of course, you have something better to offer her? I'll go help Mom. Think about it. [melancholy song playing] Mmm, mmm. Desserts aren't really as good in America. Yeah. [indistinct chatter] - [Monika] It was nice. [chuckling] - [music fades] Fantastic. [both moaning] [Enzo inhaling deeply] Come here for a second. [footsteps approaching] [Enzo] What is it? [Monika] Read this. [Enzo clearing throat] "Despite the fact that many explanations are plausible, it appears the false positive test was most likely the result of a hormonal imbalance." "The reason for this might be polycystic ovary syndrome, known as hyperprolactinaemia." "Meaning increased production of prolactin." "Excessive amounts of this hormone may interfere with ovulation." What does that mean? [somber music playing] [computer sliding] I'm not pregnant. And you never were pregnant? [sighing] You either are or you're not. And I'm not. I never was. It's a hormonal issue. [Monika breathing deeply, exhaling] What now, then? [Monika] Nothing. What about our plans? [Monika chuckling] They haven't changed in that department. [Monika chuckling] Hey. [both moaning] Let's get married ASAP. [upbeat song playing] How is it? Hold on. [Jacek] I've been holding on for 15 minutes, didn't I? [Monika giggling] Wow, wow, wow. Beautiful. Really. Belissima. - You found the perfect one quickly. - [woman] Is this your first bridal salon? Yeah. My own experience has taught me that sometimes, when you find your one true love, everything just seems to fall into place. Oh, yeah? I'm sure you say that to every customer, right? - [Monika chuckling] - [woman chuckling] That's the job. - Let's get going. I'll be in the car. - [Monika] Mm-hmm. I love it. [both giggling] [bell tolling] [Enzo] Let me see. You've got something there. [both clearing throat] [Andrzej] Uncle! - [Enzo] Um, we came here to... - [Wiktor] Spare me. I know exactly why you came here. You really took your time with this engagement. - We've been waiting a year. - [man] I've checked everything, father. Oh, Andrzej, Stefan! [chuckling] - Right. - [man] Last time we saw you, you were... Uh, no, sorry. You were actually this tall. Kind of tall already. But it was a long time ago. I remember once catching you drinking the communion wine. [laughing] Stasiu, it wasn't this one. The one you caught drinking the wine was the Tokarski boy. This is Kachek's son. I'm sorry. Yeah, I must... I'm so sorry, I must have mixed them up. No worries at all. Uh, we came to see you to arrange... The bee is the smallest among all flying things that exist on earth. Nonetheless, the bee's fruit is the source of all sweetness. [fly buzzing] What Father Wiktor is trying to say is that every one of God's creatures has a certain role to fulfill. - [Wiktor] Hmm. - [Enzo] Uh-huh. Well, since you came here to make arrangements, let's make arrangements. First and foremost, the wedding will take place right here. - Well, I need to... - In the same parish where we were born. Every one of us. [laughing] Yeah, right. That's true. Right. Second of all... I know you still have some unfinished business. Do you remember Ewa? Ewa? Ewa. - Ewa? - Eva. Oh, Ewa. Of course, I do remember her. He remembers. [whimsical music playing] We actually have to bring her back to the Christian community. In fact, after your previous, shall we say, encounter, her life has been in a downward spiral. Well, since it happened because of you, you should be the one to help resolve it. Without making amends for previous sins, you can't introduce additional happiness and pleasure. - I should write that down, right? - And share it on social media. [Wiktor breathing deeply] So, son, I think you know everything. You know what to do now. You need to find a solution soon, otherwise I won't be able to marry you. Well, all right. I think you'll be able to figure out something, right? Let's have some elderberry tea, if you please. - It's sent. - This way, let's go. We'd appreciate it if you could please remember to praise our fan page. Our parish's fan page, of course. It's very important. It's "like," not "praise." And I was supposed to say that. I'm sorry, it just kind of came out. I was being spontaneous. Good job. Keep it up, Stasiu. [sighing] - [Andrzej] Who's Ewa? - [Enzo] I have no idea. [Andrzej] You can't remember who you were dating a few years ago? Of course, I can recall. For the most part. There might have been more than one Ewa. So, how many were there? A couple? - [Enzo scoffing] - A dozen? - More than that? - [whimsical music playing] You have to tell Monika. How about you do it? No way! I'm not gonna put my neck out again to help you! - Come on, please. You're my older brother. - Stefan. That's exactly the reason. Grow up. The problem is that we've come upon a challenge of some sort. [Jacek] Okay. Do you understand any of that? - Not at all. - All right, tell us. What we're trying to say... My ex is the problem. Right. Um, keep going, please. She was just a friend. Apparently, there's some problem that I have to resolve before we get married. The problem is called Ewa. But I'm not sure which Ewa this is about. [Jacek chuckling] [sighing] Darling, I'm sorry if it's awkward. I feel terrible. I mean, can't you try in another church? No way, it's not possible. It's either him or nothing at all. Even calling the Pope wouldn't help, because Uncle... I mean Father Wiktor won't let it go. I think that your only way out of this mess is to make a list of all of your ex-girlfriends who happen to be called Ewa. [upbeat pop music playing] Looks like you're embarking on a trip. Hmm. On a trip looking for the one. Kind of a romantic Tour de Pologne. Yeah. Hon, would you go with me tomorrow? Well... I can go. You've got school. I don't have any homework. - [Enzo sighing] - [dogs barking] You know what this is? I know. This car is for Monika. A kind of dowry. This is unquestionably my most valuable possession, understood? Understood. Monika won't tell me what this is about, but I trust you. - Here you go. - [Enzo] Hmm. Take care of it like it's my daughter. Sure thing. Mmm, Darling. [kissing] Oh, like that? - Get lost. - [Enzo chuckling] All right, come here. [Monika grunting] Take care of him, okay? - He'll be safe with me. - Yeah, I'm sure of it. Come on. Take this, and let's go. Come on, they... they'll be waiting for us.

She says on her social media that her exhibition will be held here. And this must be the only place around where you can rent a room. If this is her, can she just give us something in writing or do we need to take her to Father Wiktor? [Enzo grunting] [man] Come on. Wait, please. You can't just leave like that. Ewa, you can't leave me with all of this and just take off! It's not my fault that you don't know what street art is. Street what? Well then, please explain to me what it is. [Ewa] But darling, why are you getting so upset? There's no point. - My art is not for just anyone. - What do you mean? I'll have to renovate the whole place! Yeah, but now this place is gonna have some character. It'll bring in new people. My creation isn't for everyone. It's like... - Enzo? - Ewa. What are you doing here? Look... looking for you. [chuckling] Oh, does this belong to you? [chuckling] Uh, why, do you need a ride? Yeah, sure. And you have a child seat. Awesome. And can you take my luggage? [gasping] What a beautiful car! Oh my God! I can't... [Ewa] After you. [upbeat music playing] [car door closing] Are you leaving me? Huh? No, of course not. Do you know I'm not even surprised to see you? For some time now, I've had a feeling we would meet. Call it whatever you want, a coincidence, destiny, luck, but I knew it would happen because the stars told me. Also, I've even been dreaming a lot about you, and you were just amazing, like, wow! [grunting] May I ask you something? Do you still live in Warsaw? That's where we're going. I'll be putting on an exhibition there. I'm nervous, but I'm hoping everything goes well. If that's the case, we'll spend a few days there. But Antek needs to like it. That's most important. - [Enzo] Do you resent me? - What for? Our breakup. What are you talking about? Aren't you tired? Because if you are, I could drive, you know. [Enzo grunting] Or you know what? There should be an inn around here. My friends told me about it. I can look it up online... Hold on, Ewa. You know, actually, I'd rather go home. [sighing heavily] You should go home, Enzo. So should I. But look at them. We should get some rest first. [folk music playing] - Unfortunately... - Unfortunately what? We don't have two free rooms at the moment. So then, what do you have? I have a family suite. Two bedrooms with a bathroom. [gasping] A family suite. Then we have to take it. Pay for us and we'll pay you back, if you don't mind? Sure. I didn't bring my card. - [woman chuckling] - We'll take it. [Ewa exclaiming] [dogs barking in distance] [shushing] [whispering] Let me go take a shower first. - So, look... - [shushing] - [Enzo sighing] - [Ania] Come on. [dramatic piano music playing] [footsteps approaching] [Enzo sighing] Where am I going to sleep? Well, maybe you can take the couch, and I'll put those armchairs together. Come on, it's just one night. - You have to tell Monika about Ewa. - Yep. - Maybe I should do it? - No, no, no, no, no. I'll first talk to Ewa, settle everything with her, and afterwards, I'll call Monika, okay? - Promise? - Yeah, I promise. Of course, I will. All right. I'll go get extra sheets. [music fades] [lively folk music playing] [Enzo] Ewa! [Enzo sighing] Ewa! [indistinct chatter] [crowd clamoring in distance] [cell phone ringing] MONIKA CALLING [Enzo sighing] I'm glad you're calling, hon. Do you know anything yet? [Enzo] Everything's almost taken care of. We're coming home tomorrow. - [glass breaking] - [crowd laughing] [crickets chirping] [Monika] Where are you? Hello, Stefan! Hello! I can't hear you. [folk music playing loudly] Monika, we stopped at a hotel along the way. There's a folk music festival or something on television. Ania, turn that off! I'll call you back! Bye-bye! Sorry. Watch out! [man scoffing] - [Ewa] Whoo! - [man chuckling] Whoo! Another one! Go, go, go! - [glass clanking] - Whoo! [man groaning] [Ewa exclaiming, cheering] Yes! - [Ewa laughing] - [Enzo chuckling] Whoo! Whoo! [Ewa exclaiming] Enzo! [Enzo] Come on, come on. Oh, sorry, sorry. - [Ewa exclaiming] - [Enzo] Good. [Ewa] Come on, Michał! You need some fresh air. - It's so beautiful here. - Come on, now. This is the most romantic place I've ever been! - All right, all right. - It's such a beautiful nighttime stroll. - [Ewa] It's so romantic. - [Enzo] Yeah, let's go. - Won't you at least dance with me, Enzo? - Ewa... - Oh, come on, Enzo. - [Enzo chuckling] At least one dance with me. What are you doing? Enzo, do you remember how much fun we had at that lake a few years back? - It was so good. - Ewa... - [Ewa] Let me tell you something. - Sure. - [Ewa] But don't tell anyone. Yeah? - All right. Yeah. - You really promise not to tell anybody? - I promise you. All right, so... [giggling] Um, I'm not bitter or resentful of you, although Antek is your son. [dramatic music playing] [shushing] Son? But it's okay. It's okay because the universe is freaking amazing. Wow! [inhaling deeply] Okay. - [Enzo sighing] - [dog barking] - [dogs howling] - [Ewa howling] [dog barking] [Ewa] Good morning, everyone. I slept so well. It was crazy last night. Hi, sweetheart. Where are your vegetables? I'll bring you some. [indistinct chatter] [Enzo] What now? Breakfast. Why didn't you tell me? About breakfast? Ah, I just... I didn't want you to feel obligated. It was, uh, my choice, my decision. I didn't expect anything from you. Where are you staying in Warsaw? I can give you a ride, but tomorrow, I need you to tell all this to a certain priest, okay? A priest? I'll explain everything, just... Let's leave right away, okay? I don't wanna rush. Eating in a hurry gives you stomach ulcers. You're a bit quiet today, boss. [clearing throat, sniffling] [pop music playing over radio] Not that you're particularly talkative in general. But today? Ooh, so quiet. Wow, you're such a talker! Whoa! Hmm. Boss, have you heard what happened to that Gusman guy's car? Ha! You know the one we hammered out the other day? He caught his wife with the neighbor in his garage, right? And she was so taken aback, she slammed the gas pedal and pancaked him. A bloodbath. CAN'T TALK NOW, I'M IN A MEETING So it's about a lady? I knew it. [dog barking] No offense, but the way I see it, she was a bit out of your league, boss. Goddamn it, Wiesiek! Could you just focus on work right now instead of... - [Bazyli sighing] - I could, boss. Damn right, I could focus on work. SHOP - You're coming with me. - Why Is that? So you don't do anything stupid. How can you suspect me of such a thing? Ewa, this vehicle... Please, enough. It's just a car to me, you know? No arguments. Get out. Come on. All right, but you have to buy me something. [Enzo chuckling] [pop music playing on radio] [Ewa] Hmm. - Enzo. - [Enzo] Hmm? How do I look? You look nice. Let me see them on your face. - [Ewa gasping] - [Enzo grunting] - [Ewa] Gorgeous! - Yeah? - [Ewa] Mm-hmm. - [Enzo chuckling] I have to go pee-pee. You're free, you know? [Enzo chuckling] - Hi, how are you? - Hi. Which pump, ma'am? - [doorbell chiming] - Number six, please. [doorbell chiming] What's that on your face? - Why aren't you in the car? - Ewa sent me to get ice cream. - [car engine starting] - Take that. Take that! [Enzo] Oh shit! [rock music playing] [Enzo panting] [both howling] Where do you want to go, my sweet angel? If you want, we can even go to the end of the world. To Europe! [gasping] Or instead, maybe you'd prefer to visit Mexico or Africa? Remember, dreams have no limits, amigo. You left it in the car. [Enzo sighing] Give me yours. - [cell phone ringing] - [Ewa] Ugh. We are not picking up right now. Please, try again later. [both howling] [cell phone ringing] Okay, hold on, Antek, Auntie Monika is calling. Hi, Monika. You're currently on speakerphone and speaking with Ewa and Antek. Hi, this is Antek. Antek is saying hi as well. Uh, we'll meet soon, sweetie, and hopefully we'll even get along and become fast friends? [Monika] Excuse me? Hi, this is Ewa. Please leave a message, and remember, the universe is listening. Bye! [horn honking] Get in, don't make us wait all day. - [engine stopping] - [car door opening] Can't a girl take a ride? Whoa! By the way, Monika called and she says hi. - What? - [Ewa] I talked to her. She's waiting. I'm hoping she's cooking something since I'm starving. - What about you? - Yeah, me too. I tell you what, it's not the best car I've ever driven, but it's definitely in the top five. It has potential. [Enzo groaning] [Ewa] Did you have fun, darling? The world is ours. Remember that. [rock music playing] Watch where you're going, you stupid asshole! - [Enzo] Put your seatbelt on, please! - Didn't you see his reckless driving? [Ewa sighing] Ugh! Going back to what I was saying earlier. You see, Enzo, this is what it's like to be a bold and creative artist in today's world. Obviously, now I won't be able to go back home anytime soon or anywhere in town for that matter. - So, what's your plan? - [Ewa] Oh. Plan? [exhaling sharply] - You're my plan! - What? Chill out. I was just joking. Geez But if you ask me nicely, I might go with you to see that priest. I've just been thinking about it since this morning, and I think it's a very good idea. So, Antek has never been to Warsaw, and once in the capital, I could spread my wings... I'm sorry. Spread my wings artistically speaking and maybe even do some kind of performance or a gallery show. Oh! So many types of art. [exhaling] I know. I'll find a job for sure. After all, I'm very good, so... Plus, you could finally get to know Antek better. - [Antek giggling] - You know, spend some time together. - [dramatic orchestral music playing] - [birds chirping] [kids screaming] - What's going on? - [woman] He's... he's back, Monika! - She means the principal. - Mm-hmm. To audit the school! [exhaling] Let's go, then. - No, no. We're staying. You go. Come on. - Yes. Oh, we can air this place out. - And we can watch your office too. - Yes. Come on, let's go. - But don't you want me to clean... - Let's go! Let's go, then. But come on, don't you understand, Monika? Don't you... - He's come to get retribution on us. - Yeah! - Don't worry. I'm sure he forgot already. - Uh-huh. - [Monika] Hello there. - Good morning, good morning. Can we talk in private? - Yes. - Yes. Principal... Superintendent. [kids chattering] [Monika] An audit? So soon? I've just started. - That's precisely the reason. - [Monika] Mm-hmm. All right. So, in that case I might talk about my plans. I'm well aware of where to search for any flaws. Just please remember that my predecessor neglected some important issues. Well, I'm interested in the future, not the past. It's time to make some changes. Principal... Sir... I... I mean, Superintendent. [Monika] What happened? Ms. Marysia had to leave suddenly. Food poisoning. [Monika] Hmm. Are any of you free now? [principal grunting] All right then, I'll take over for Ms. Marysia. Hold on. Since when is the principal a substitute teacher? Since now. [upbeat music playing] All right, who can tell me what honey looks like? - Karolina? - [Karolina] It's yellow. Yellow. All right. We have that. What else? No, we'll deal with this later. Uh, yes? [girl] It's sticky. Yes, honey is sticky. Great. Uh, write it down, please. - Uh, go ahead. - Excuse me. [girl 2] It's sweet. - Madam Principal, please, I just... - I told you to come in on Monday, right? - [man] Yes. - Then I'll see you on Monday. Thank you. Hmm. All right. You've written it down, right? - Yellow, sticky and what else? - [bell ringing] I'm glad to see you. We have to talk. It's about my little Alan. He's exceptionally gifted. Exceptionally. Which is why I believe he isn't being appreciated enough. He didn't get an "A" since the start of the year. That's right because grades one, two, three don't... don't use the standard grading system. - E-enough, guys! - So, how can I know if my son is the best? Uh, I... I can assure you that Alan is a great student, but I'm really sorry, ma'am, this is neither the time nor the place to have this conversation, so please come back tomorrow. Principal... Ma'am, the insurance company is doing an audit. - An audit? Now? - I don't know, but they're here. - Go. We can take care of things here. - The Superintendent's doing rounds. - Don't worry. We've got it. - Calm down! Sit down, children! Sit down, sit down. Clean this up! Sit down, sit down. - [whistle blowing] - Keep quiet! Principal, I'd suggest taking the long way 'round. [panting] This way, it's safer. [dramatic orchestral music playing] Any conclusions yet? Did we pass the audit? Well, today, I'm just here visiting my old haunt. The actual audit begins tomorrow. Excuse me. [man sighing heavily] - [music playing over headphones] - [Ewa] Monika! [Ewa clearing throat] Monika! Monika! It's so nice to finally meet you. I was so looking forward to it. We're only meeting for the first time, Sweetie, but I feel like we've known each other for years. Enzo's told me a lot about you. - He has? - [Ewa] Mm-hmm. But, of course, he refused to stop on the way so that we could buy you a small gift from the both of us. [Antek groaning] - From both of us? - [Ewa] Mm-hmm. Antoni. I'm five years old. Nice to meet you, Auntie. Hi, Antoni. [Ewa] Well done, sweetheart! [gasping] Oh my God. You've got such a beautiful home! Although, you didn't have to clean just for our visit. Darling, I would've helped you out. Thank you very much, Enzo. Take good care of him. And I... [breathing deeply] ...would really love a cup of coffee. [dramatic music playing] [Ewa] Wow! I think you forgot to mention something? [machinery whirring] - [mystical music playing] - Water. I am water. I am water. I am a stream. [Ewa exclaiming] Sweetie, I have a feeling that your aura is a bit closed off. Please, hold on. This little wonder clears the path for totally pure energy while dispelling negative vibrations, all those thought patterns... I'm sorry. [chuckling] I mainly focus on self-development and spiritual leadership. I was thinking... Hmm. Eh. It's been so nice talking to you guys. You're such fantastic people. [Ewa breathing deeply, exhaling] [Ewa] Sweetheart, shouldn't you be going to bed? [Antek] Mm-hmm. [Ewa] Okay, then... Darlings, where can we go lie down tonight? [dog barking] [both moaning] I can't thank you enough for letting them stay for a few days. [Monika chuckling] - [door opening] - [Ewa] You have conditioner? Um, in the closet, on the top shelf. Thanks! [Monika clearing throat] You didn't have to do that. It's obvious that she doesn't know anyone here. - [door opening] - [Ewa] Have toothpaste without fluoride? - [Monika] No. - [Ewa] Hmm. [door creaking loudly] [Enzo sighing] Why didn't you just tell me? - I didn't know. - Are you sure you didn't know? - [Ewa] He really didn't know! - [Enzo groaning] How about hand cream? Fine. I'll find it myself. [soft pop song playing] ♪ Let me take you to my galaxy ♪ ♪ Say goodbye to all your wars ♪ [Monika chuckling] ♪ Close your eyes, I'll be your gravity ♪ - [song stops] - [blender whirring] [Ewa] Holy crap. Dammit. Hello there, my beautiful soul! [both grunting] I'm very sorry for the mess, but last night was so nice that I went a little wild and drank half a glass too much. [Ewa sighing] I'll clean all this up in a moment, don't worry. Anyway. Maybe you'd like, uh, some fruit, huh? Or maybe I could make you Five Elements Coffee? No, thank you. Did you know that know Antek couldn't sleep last night? He was tossing and turning all night. Finally, he went to wake up Enzo. Isn't it great that he's feeling at home here? Yeah, I'm glad. - Hey. - Hi, sweetie. - Hey, good morning! - [Enzo] Morning. Uh, would you want some coffee or an orange slice? Oh! Some coffee for sure. Let me make you some. And aren't you a bit cold? - What? - Aren't you cold? [Ewa chuckling] I'm sorry, I'm just like that. For some reason, I'm always hot. I could stand here in the middle of the room, completely naked, and my body would still be dripping with sweat. You know how it is. I'm hot-blooded. [Monika] Hmm. Sure, you are. [contemplative music playing] [Monika] Excuse me a moment. [Monika exclaiming] Sweetheart... I called about our wedding venue. We have an appointment in two days in Ambaras on Łowicka Street. Łowicka? - [Monika] Mm-hmm. - Mmm. On Łowicka? Mmm! I was there once with some painter. It's an incredible story. I didn't tell you. So, get this. He bought a full case of champagne from Champagne, France, for me. The real stuff. Like we used to drink, remember? [Ewa breathing deeply, exhaling] [Enzo sighing] Um, why don't we have that coffee, now? Uh, is that where you keep the cups? Monika, nothing's in the right place here. That's why I can't feel any energy flow around here. And that's why you look so puffy in the morning. Come on, come on, let me help you. We can change it all. Don't you worry. Ha! It makes sense now. Come on, hold it. No, I can't. I... I have to get ready... For work. But wait, it'll make you healthier! - Monika... [sighing] - [Monika clearing throat] [Enzo groaning] I wanted to help, that's all. [Enzo] I know, I know. Ewa, get dressed. We have to get going, okay? Thanks. [Enzo breathing deeply, sighing] A few days ago I wasn't even sure I wanted a family. [emotional music playing] And when I look at them, I don't know, I feel a little... [birds chirping] [Bazyli] What? Jealous? Maybe a little. I know the type. What? Me? No, Ewa. She pretends to be poor, vulnerable, doesn't wanna make a fuss, but the next day, she's off to the Canary Islands with your husband and your money. And before that she crawls in your bed... You were supposed to wait in the car. It's hot and I was thirsty. Why did you open your mouth? What? Someone has to be honest with your daughter. [Wiesiek breathing deeply, exhaling] You took into your house a strange hippie woman with a kid. What if it's not actually his child? Do you have proof, hmm? [slurping] Listen. A friend of a friend has a friend whose brother-in-law is a private investigator. All right, Wiesiek, let's go. Bye, Monika. Bye, Dad. - I'll send you his number. He's the best. - Let's go. - Thank you, no need. - Come on. [Wiesiek grunting] Why are you looking at me like that? [birds chirping] [Enzo] I'll just tell him it was a misunderstanding and that we've sorted it out, okay? Wow, it's so beautiful here. I will help you in any way I can. And I wanna spend as much time as possible with Antek. - But... - But what, Enzo? The last few days were crazy. I just... I think it's time to go back to normal. Listen to me. You can always count on me, but I love Monika and I'm marrying her, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Antek. Your hands. Good morning, you three. I assume you've resolved your problems? Yes. Let's go, then. Follow me. [Antek] It's so cool here! [Ewa] You like it? [Enzo] Wait up. [Stasiu] They're here, Father They seem more remorseful, I guess. - [whimsical music playing] - [Wiktor clearing throat] I'm not gonna beat around the bush. Have you resolved all of your problems, my child? [Ewa] Praised be the Lord. Father, we decided to... Right now, I'm talking to Ewa. [Wiktor sighing] God bless you, my dear child. Speak freely. Yes, we solved all our issues. We've just been... [Wiktor shushing] Please could you elaborate on that, my child. Enzo looked after my son and me. He also wants to be part of Antek's life, who he didn't know about, which wasn't his fault but mine. And everything they publish on those gossip websites is false. He's a wonderful man. Please, Father, don't believe a word they say. [Wiktor chuckling] I'm glad you finally learned your lesson, my son. A busy bee turns even the most bitter flower into honey. It's from the Bible? No, Enzo. It's just a folk saying. Stanislaw... Well, the author is unknown. [hands clapping] Since everything's been sorted, we won't bother you any longer, Father. No, I'm sorry. I'm not done yet. I'd like to say one more thing. You see, uh, Enzo is like the handsome Samaritan from the Bible. He brought us here, gave us clothes, fed us healthy food, provided us a place to sleep, and allowed us stay at his house until the wedding, to which he even invited us as guests of honor. [Ewa squealing] - [Antek squealing] - [Ewa giggling] Well, it's time to go. Just wait, hold on. You can't always fix the mistakes you make when you're younger. Nevertheless, we always have to try to make up for them. [Wiktor inhaling] Hmm? Stanisław, write it down and share it immediately. Sent, Father. Hmm, yes. All right. I must say, I'm not as angry with you as I was the last time we talked, hmm? In that case, I may officially confirm the wedding date with you, now. I'll see you in three weeks. Oh, and don't forget to remind your brother. - [Antek moaning] - Remind him? He'll know very well what I'm talking about. - [Antek] Mom... - [Ewa] Hey. - Remember, He's watching you all the time. - Who? - God? - No. Father Wiktor is watching you. Let's go, come on. [Antek moaning] Mom... [Ewa] All right, honey, I'll be free. [music fades] Oh! There you are! I have to work now, so please don't enter the studio for a while, okay? See you. Yeah, all right. [footsteps thudding] [door closing] Tomorrow? Tomorrow sounds wonderful. [hip-hop music playing] [Enzo exclaiming] [exclaiming] Enzo! Enzo, Enzo, Enzo! Hey, hey, hey! Your beloved, magnificent Enzo back in his chair. As I see, today's poor turnout leads me to believe that the topic I picked last time is uncomfortable for some and that not everyone is ready to discuss it. I understand you. However, safety might not be spectacular or even particularly interesting, but it's quite necessary and important. But don't worry. We won't just talk about it in theory. [whimsical music playing] [hip-hop music playing] - [Antek giggling] - Antek! Antek, come here! Antek, come on. Please, come here. [exclaiming] No... Antek... - Come here. - [Antek giggling] Hey! [grunting] Sorry, sorry, sorry, but I need to take a few minutes off because... Antoni. I'm five-years-old. Nice to virtually meet you all. It's because of him that I realized how important it is to stay safe and take care of your loved ones. INDZIA: SO SWEET Antoni... Ow! Hey! Do you wanna be my little helper? - [Antek giggling] - Yeah? [soft pop song playing on radio] - What? - Did you know... Did you know my brother had a crush on you? - No! - A big one. - Oh, he was so sweet! - [Enzo chuckling] Sweet? He looked like a dumb fool. - He didn't... - With the hair? - Oh, hey! - Oh! You're back! We've been waiting for you, Monika. You must have a good reason to drink the champagne that I save for special occasions. You always manage to surprise me. Such a basic champagne for special occasions? Monika, I'm sorry. Ewa surprised me. - Right, of course it was Ewa. - [Enzo] Here. Listen. Today thanks to an incredible set of circumstances... What set of circumstances? Be specific. It was thanks to our Antek. You're absolutely right, that's true. Thanks to Antek, I've recorded the best show in my life. In a quarter of an hour we got to 60,000 viewers. Yeah, and the important thing to know is that before Antek's appearance, the audience fell below 1,000. - Well, congratulations, hon. - Thank you, hon. Uh, and do you think it's all right to use Antek in this way? He's very happy. He had a great time. And, you know, if he can make a few bucks while doing it, why not? Do you know how much college costs? After just maybe an hour, I got three partnership offers. - You got four, honey. - Ah! Four! Four! That's right. I just got another one. Um, and I think you shouldn't take all of them right away. What do you mean? Why not? [Ewa] It's important to present yourself right. I can help you with that if you want, hmm? - That's great. - [Ewa] Mm-hmm? No, that's enough! Enough! Let's not talk about work. Enough. [Ewa] Mm-hmm. I'm sorry. I have to lie down. I'm exhausted. Uh, but we're celebrating. And you're fine without me. - Goodnight. - [Ewa] Goodnight! [door closing] [music stops] [crickets chirping] [dog barking] [Enzo] Mmm. [contemplative music playing] Hey. Hey. She's already rearranged our kitchen, maybe it's time for the bedroom? [sighing] Oh, come on. You're overreacting. She just... She tried to be nice. She meant well. [Monika scoffing] Are you so sure about that? You know each other that well? It was just a short fling a few years ago. [Monika grunting] That's right. So why did she come here, then? [Enzo chuckling] - I don't think she's honest. - Not honest about what? Everything. About Antek? He's my son. Are you so sure about that? [Monika sighing] [music fades] [birds chirping] [torque wrench whirring] [Bazyli gasping] [objects clanging loudly] [dogs barking] [Aleksandra] Is this the meeting? It's just... I... I've got a lot of work. That's why you aren't answering my calls? Because I've really got a lot of work now. Bazyli, did I offend you at all? I don't know, maybe... I thought the dinner was really nice, didn't you? Definitely won't forget it for a long time. Really. I've got a lot of work and... Oh, come on. What's really going on? [somber music playing] I'm just wondering if... maybe we should just take things more slowly? Especially now that your son is here. I don't want to come between you two and... and that's it. But I don't... I don't mind splitting my time between you two. [Bazyli] Hmm. I will call you. Let's begin. Principal Monika, I think I can address you in this way since we're now colleagues and peers? I appreciate that you're trying to bring the school into the 21st century, Unfortunately, some of your employees are firmly stuck, unlike you, in the 19th century. I think our teachers are excellent. - You really believe that? - [Monika] Mm-hmm. I think we both know who I'm talking about. Take a look. [dramatic orchestral music playing] Complete ignorance of the technological world and the e-registry system, no multimedia training whatsoever. No usage of audiovisual materials in her extracurricular classes, and, obviously, no online training. Overall, they're hopelessly incompetent. A top-down reform is absolutely necessary for this school. You're being closely watched by the school board, and... [grunting] ...they're making sure you can make it as the head of a school like this one, or if you're merely a famous face on television. [Monika] Hmm. [indistinct chatter] There's nothing that can be done? There is. There's always something you can do. Uh, but the things is, you know, an old tree is practically impossible to move around. An old tree like that should be uprooted, you know what I mean? Chopped into small pieces using a chainsaw, burnt down, bagged, dumped into the river, and gone for good. That's all. [whimsical music playing] [alarm blaring] Get to the emergency exit, two-by-two! Two-by-two to the exit! Hurry up, it's dangerous! To the exit! Let me through, let me through! Come on, let me through. [trash can sizzling] It's all under control. [coughing] The fire is out. [clearing throat] Luckily, I was here. Ms. Monika, no students or teachers were harmed. It was a pretty close call. No need to thank me. Helping out is, in a way, my second nature. We just... That dang smoke detector used to be broken in there! [woman] You're completely irresponsible. I've been telling you for years. Stop nagging me all the time! All you do is nag, nag, nag, constantly. Except it doesn't work. Like talking to a brick wall! - Wait for me! - A deaf brick wall! - Wait for me! - [woman] What now? - I have to wait for you, huh? - [woman 2] Just wait for me! - Please call off the firefighters, okay? - Right away, principal. Thank you. - [principal] Hmm. - [Monika] Mm-hmm. SZMON29: CUTIES [Enzo] That's all for today. Tomorrow we'll talk about muff... - About muff... - Mufflers, yeah. - Mufflers. - Right. - Mufflers! - Yeah! [chuckling] Thanks for being here with me. See you, guys! - [Antek giggling] - Bye! Oh, check this! A user sent us a heart! Yeah, they're sending us hearts buddy. Thanks. We're doing incredible! High five! Ha! Amazing! [cell phone ringing] Marcin? [indistinct chatter] [woman clearing throat] What is this? It's our resignations. But I wasn't planning on firing you! At most, I'd have sent you to some computer training, or something. - Monika, we know, we know. - Yes, but we... Well, we were eavesdropping earlier by the door. We didn't, we heard by accident! It does happen sometimes. [woman] We heard your conversation. Yes, we did. Um, we hate him, but he's right. We were mad. We were so mad by what we had heard! And that's when I had to go for a smoke. And the new fire detectors went crazy. But then, we calmed down, and... [sighing]...we're doing this to avoid causing you any inconvenience. Right. You've got your plans, a lot of them. We would just hold you up, if you know what I mean. - I don't agree at all. - Monika. [somber music playing] The school needs to make significant progress, and we're close to retirement anyway. Yeah. I promise you everything will be fine. We know what we're doing. Come on, let's go. TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT [kids clamoring] Hi, Monika. Oh, hi. I was just in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd see how you're doing. How I'm doing? Uh... All right, to be honest with you, I've been stuck in traffic for an hour simply to ask you how your father's doing. He's become withdrawn lately, and I don't know why. [emotional music playing] I was wondering if maybe during that dinner at my place, something had happened to him. Maybe. Or he's withdrawing so you can spend some time alone with Damian. [Aleksandra] Hmm. So it is about Damian. Thanks for your time. - It's fine. - You look great. I'll talk to you later. [Aleksandra sighing] All the portals are writing about you. The wonder trio. Father, son, and cars. That's why I've got a great business proposal for you. So I'm not blacklisted anymore? [man] You know it was a question of time before you got a chance to rehabilitate yourself. - What about Alicja? - Alicja. Alicja doesn't work here anymore. She was transferred to Shanghai. [Enzo] So you think she forgot? [panting] Enzo, the lady never forgets. But right now, she's got 100,000 new employees working for her, so she's got other fish to fry. And the Polish editorial office is mine. And I've got a hit for you, you hear? A hit. The Dakar rally. Whoa! Yeah! [Enzo sighing] And the budget? [upbeat music playing] Sky is the limit? What? No, I'm going upstairs to see the board to figure that out. [Enzo chuckling] Yeah. I know it's always been your dream. Have a good one. Out of the way! [Enzo sighing] [Antek] I will transform into this one. [Antek howling] - [Antek] And I... - [Ewa giggling] [Enzo] Hey. - Hey! Um, how do I look? - And I will transform into this one! You look nice. [Ewa] Just nice? I've got an important meeting, I'm stressed about it, I'm telling you about my worries, and you just say I look nice? Nice is not good enough! [Enzo chuckling softly] Uh, could you lend me a couple hundred? My new card came to the old address so now I don't have a couple hundred. I don't have any cash right now. Oh, no. That really sucks! Oh, but I see a card here. - [Ewa giggling] - [Enzo chuckling] What the hell, I'm having a good day. Here you go. So you're saying I have the night off, and you're looking after the kid? Good, and remember, I trust you. We're a family, after all. We're getting along at work, we can get along in our private lives. [Ewa] Bye! [Enzo chuckling] - What do you wanna play? - Casino! Here it is. Here comes the plane about to land! Here comes... [grunting] Some more? - What's that? Look! - No! What is that? It looks disgusting. ["Today is the Day" by Ornette playing] [Enzo] Hey! [Antek giggling] No! ♪ Here we go full speed ahead ♪ - [Enzo grunting] - [Antek giggling] - Take that! And that! And that! - Antek, wait! Enough! No! No! Come on. Come on! [groaning] No! [sighing] Give it to me. I want it back. [shushing] Hold on. One second. - Dad... Here we go. [Enzo groaning] [Antek] Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! What's going on? [Antek] Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! He won't stop shouting. Ewa's not coming home and not picking up her phone. - Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! - Antek! What's going on, huh? Do you miss your mommy? - [Monika scoffing] - [Antek] Mom! Mom! Mom! Quiet, Antek! Just settle down, now! It's okay. Don't worry. Everything will be all right, hmm? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I had a tough day. Should we call your mommy? Yeah? I'm sure she'll be back soon. Come here, bud. Come here. Hi, this is Ewa. Please leave a message and remember, the universe is listening. - Bye! - [footsteps approaching] - [Enzo sighing] - [Monika] Good morning. Ewa's still not picking up. Maybe something's happened? Mom does that sometimes. It happens. Sometimes she disappears for a bit like that. [Monika] Mm-hmm. And what about you, then? I'm with my auntie or my granny sometimes, or also my other auntie but I prefer my... And do you know when Mom will be back? Maybe tomorrow, or yesterday. [dog barking] And please tell me, do you know where we can find your mommy? No. - She have any friends here? - No, just you. [scoffing] Just us. [Monika sighing] I'm not sure what we should do now. I'll keep calling until she picks up. Mm-hmm. Okay, what time is it? - Geez. Okay, I gotta go! - Uh... - See you later. - Bye. Here you go, bud. Oh, and remember we've got a meeting at the restaurant today. [objects clattering] That's today? No, yesterday. Okay, I'm going. Bye! [door closing] Hi, this is Ewa. Please leave a message and remember, the universe is listening. Bye! [upbeat music playing] [indistinct chatter] [woman] The structure of a plant cell. Endoplasmic reticulum. That's correct. Very good, Wiktoria. The next structure is ribosomes. Can you identify? Very good. Moving on. Maja? The cell nucleus? Very good. [kids clamoring] [all cheering] [indistinct chatter] [Monika chuckling] [man] Well, if we put the tables sideways, we can fit in over 50 people. Okay. Let's move on to the menu and decorations. - [Ewa] Antek! - Mommy! [Ewa] Hi, sweetheart! [grunting] - [Antek moaning] - Oh my God. What a lovely place! Yeah. Uh, Bohemian mood with a cool vibe. - Where were you? - Ooh... - Uh, very spacious. - Yes, ma'am? Thanks a lot. And what if it rains, though? We're ready for that. We've got a huge canopy, hmm? - Uh-huh. What color? - Well, same as this here. Cream. Hmm. And the lighting? Well, we've got 65 candles. [gasping] That's great. We require a lot of light. We can light some paper lanterns, or also add some string lights, for example. Uh, and the dance floor is... Well, right here. Oh! It's way too tiny to work out. - [man chuckling nervously] - On the contrary, it's more than adequate. [man] Oh, hello there. Hello, sir. [chuckling] Is this the maid of honor? [funky music playing over radio] No, she's the bride. [man] And you're the maid of honor? No, this is just the... mother of my child. Oh, of course. Well, I mean, the customer's always right. I had no idea I could still be surprised. Um, let's move on to the menu. [chuckling] We will pay for everything. I had no idea she'd come. [Ewa] Wait for us! [Ewa panting] Where were you? Ugh! Listen, it's an incredible story. I met up with an old friend who I haven't seen in a long time and... And what? You couldn't have let us know? No. So we went out of town, but, uh, unfortunately a tree fell on the road. We couldn't get through, and that's when it started to rain. And the buses weren't operating. And of course, my phone died unexpectedly. What'd I tell you? We called you a million times. There was a signal. The worst part is that my credit card hasn't arrived yet, all right? So even if I needed to, I couldn't even pay for a cab. You see? She couldn't. New card? When were you at the bank, though? Uh, what do you mean? Um, I called them. What address did you give 'em? Monika, what are you getting at? You've got a son. Yes, I do have a son, but I left him with you. And as far as I know, you're much more responsible than I am. So nothing really happened. It's all good. Right, kiddo? I think we have to postpone the wedding. You have more important stuff to deal with. [car horn honking] [tools clanking] We're about to close up. [sighing] Where's my Dad? He left. Uh, he went to dinner. With whom? Aleksandra. [both chuckling] - I'm pleased they reconciled. - [Wiesiek] Did something happen? [Monika] Nothing. What happened? Ewa happened. Never mind. [Wiesiek] I've got something for you. [pop music playing over radio] I hired that private investigator. But I told you I didn't want that. We've had our ups and downs, but to me, you're like a little sister. Think of it as, uh, a wedding gift from me for your new beginning. [dramatic music playing] [Wiesiek sighing] [papers rustling] Do whatever you wish. I finished work a half-hour ago. [jazzy music playing] [indistinct chatter] Good evening. - [Damian sighing] - Hey. - Hello. - [Damian] Hello. You didn't tell me we'd have company. Is that a problem, darling? Is that not okay? - Maybe I should actually... - [Aleksandra] Sit down. Sit down, please. You didn't want to talk to me, so now you'll have to listen. Focus, you two, because I won't repeat myself. I'm gonna tell you what I don't like. - My son comes to me twice a year, at most. - Excuse me? And when he asks me to go with him to the US, it's just because he thinks I have nothing better to do here. Chanise and I are both busy. We have children to look after. Chanise and the nanny are looking after them. Your work has often led you to depression. [Damian sighing] How do you know? I don't know if you're aware, but I've known you your entire life. - Are you ready to order? - One moment. Try to imagine, even though I'm not a manager on Wall Street, I have my own life here. I'll visit you in the US as often as possible. I'll help you where I can. But Bazyli is the one who's here with me always, whatever the situation. Um, we'll have a bottle of your best white wine, please. - To go. - [waiter] Mm-hmm. Think about it. [dramatic music playing] [music fades] [indistinct chatter] Why didn't you tell me about the talk you had with Damian? I just didn't want to interfere with your family matters, or with your move to the United States, you know? [Bazyli sighing] Plus, Ola, what could I have said? Are you scared to be with me? No. Yes. I don't know. We're no spring chickens anymore. - Exactly! I don't want to be alone. - Me neither. Are you sure? I'm sure. Ola, I need you. [emotional music playing] Even your damn chickens. [Aleksandra sighing] - [Bazyli chuckling] I'm kidding. - [Aleksandra chuckling] [Bazyli] I can grow to like 'em. You see, I... I pulled away because I just wanted to make sure... Um, or to see if, you know... If... This is my best world. Here, with you. [Ewa and Enzo laughing] - [Enzo] This is good. - [Ewa] Good. Mm-hmm. [giggling] I know why you came here. - What? - Monika, what do you mean? I think Ewa knows exactly what I mean. Will you tell him or should I? This look familiar? [dramatic music playing] [Monika] How about these? Here. PRIVATE INVESTIGATION CONTRACT Let's start from the beginning. [Monika breathing deeply, exhaling] [Monika] Why have you moved around the country so much? Why don't you have a bank account? The reason you came to Warsaw is to run away from creditors. How do you know that? You thought you'd get back together. That you'd get rid of me. Monika, just stop it. Yes. I did in the beginning, but then I saw how close you became with Antek and I thought that... I'm sorry for everything. I see now that this was just stupid. I thought that this maybe could be our home. Our place. Together with Enzo. Is Antek really my son? I don't know. I'll go upstairs and pack our things. I'm sorry for everything. [Monika sighing] [music fades] [birds chirping] You really hired a PI? I didn't hire him. - I shouldn't have read it. - No, you shouldn't have. What? Did you order a paternity test as well? I wouldn't have done that. Just because you don't wanna have kids, you didn't have to take away my son. Do you think it's that simple, huh? To see you start a family with another woman? - But I'm not interested in Ewa! - [Monika] Does Ewa know that? It seems to me she came up with a great plan. A plan that leaves no place for me. Sorry you don't understand how much it means to me to have a son. I'm sorry you don't understand how you let Ewa come in the way of us. You're right, Monika. We have to postpone the wedding. [door slamming] Hi, this is Ewa. Please leave a message and remember, the universe is listening. Bye! She's not picking up. Hmm. That's not good. I don't think I should've opened that envelope. I guess, but you wouldn't have known anything otherwise. And now Ewa and her kid are probably lost somewhere. [jazzy music playing over radio] Well, maybe there's something wrong with me? Stefan just wants to be a father, but I'm just completely not ready for that. And I really think he should be with someone who appreciates it. [indistinct chatter] Will you help me call off the wedding? - Call it off? - It's just too much for me to handle. Are you sure about that? Wow. Wow. TO: EWA CAN I HELP YOU IN ANY WAY? Stefan! Not that I mind at all, but this is the third time you moved in here. I just wanted to build a relationship with my son. And you didn't think about Monika in that situation? About how she feels about it? Now you wanna call off the wedding. You sure about that? I just have to think it through. You always have to think things through like that? Ania! Don't be rude! Starting a family is a decision you have to make together. You can't just force anyone to do it. You can always give yourself time, on the other hand. Can you hear yourself right now? You sound like Dad again, Andrzej. Why are you in such a hurry to have children? Do you really want to change diapers and not sleep all night? Now you sound like my Mom. Don't you have homework to do, huh? [Andrzej] Ania, let your uncle destroy his life in peace and go to your room. We'll talk about it again when you grow up. [door closing] You're right... She does sound like Mom. [funky music playing] - You're here as well? - Are we doing their dirty work again? We should be having a beer instead of this. [clearing throat] Come in, gentlemen. [Andrzej sighing] You first. Uh, God bless. - God bless. - God bless. What can I help you with? I'm sorry to bother you, Father. I've come to see you on Monika's behalf. And also Enzo... I mean, Stefan. - Right. - That's what I thought. I thought it was too easy. No, Stasiu, that's what I thought. Well, if you say so. The issue is the wedding must be called off, unfortunately. Postpone. Hmm. That's a shame. We just think the young couple needs some more time to think it through. Sure, they might. In that case, gentlemen, all I can do is answer this with one of my favorite quotes from the Holy Bible. So, please pay close attention. [Wiktor sighing] "No." [music fades] - [Jacek] Uh-huh... - What do you mean? No. It's not the first or last time something like this has happened. But similar to how bees labor to collect nectar that is, you know, eventually converted into honey People must work tirelessly to maintain their love and strengthen it through sacrament. Well, Father, it sounds like you have a plan. - Oh. - Oh, okay. But first of all, don't say anything to Monika and Enzo. Hmm? Sometimes, even often, love has to be saved despite the stubbornness of the ones involved. Are you quoting the Bible again? [Stasiu] No, not at all. These are the Father's own words that I shared on our Valentine's Day fan page, which has expanded immensely since then. [Wiktor] And Stefan and Monika are head over heels in love. It's as clear as day. All right. Let me tell you what we'll do. Get closer. [funky music playing] Now, we will... [door closing] [kids clamoring] Will you sign the farewell cards, Monika? Of course, yeah. We're starting the picnic in a few. Are you ready?

I've heard about your decision regarding the two teachers. I have to admit, I was worried about you. I thought you were too sensitive for this position. That you'd think about people, rather than results. [dramatic music playing] I'm very happy to hear that you actually understood that the result is what really matters. The result, not people. Very good work. ♪ Eco, eco, ecology It tickles my green thumb ♪ ♪ It tickles my green thumb ♪ [crowd cheering] [Monika] Thanks a lot for that, girls. I'd like to offer a warm welcome to everyone attending our school's inaugural integration picnic. [Monika sighing] When I accepted this position, I promised that I'd bring this school into the 21st century. [breathing deeply, exhaling] By focusing on the future, I forgot what we had. [dramatic music playing] If entering the 21st century means getting rid of some of our most beloved teachers, then I'd rather stay in the 20th century. I don't accept your resignations. But I do submit my own in front of all of you. [music stops] [birds chirping] I think it's time for me to go back to where my place is. With the children. [crowd cheering] [woman] Congratulations! [both laughing] [woman] Congrats, Monika! [upbeat music playing] My dear Monika, congratulations! Thank you so much! You told them, Monika. You did good. The principal can shove it up... Hello. Shove it up my what exactly? Your arm. Never. Let me be clear, I never thought you were right for this position. You're just a simple teacher like your two incompetent friends. That's great. I never wanted anything more. [Monika chuckling] [Ewa sighing] [Antek] Quickly! [Ewa sighing] - [cell phone ringing] - Oh. Excuse me. I don't think he got his Ph.D. in manners, did he? You can say that again... - Hello? - [Ewa] Hi. Does your offer to help us still stand? [Monika] Where are you? [chuckling] Incredible. Who would've thought? Who would've thought? Such a small channel. First videos shot on a cell phone and then bam! 100,000 subscribers! [panting] From one live stream alone. It's incredible, huh? But don't worry, Enzo, we won't leave you alone with this. One signature and a team of specialists in this field, as well as global streaming services is yours. - No. - Excuse me? Article seven, section three, subsection C. "The editorial office holds creative control over all content created and presented." That's just some standard wording you always put in a contract. [panting] But, really, you bring us ideas, we just edit them a bit. What about the non-compete? What, you still want to offer your little channel? Fine, we can compensate you for that. [chuckling] That sounds awesome, but... [man] "But, but, but." Enzo! Think about it! You'll be back on top! Women, events, parties, and you. [chuckling] You, man. Millions of people watching you and your videos, man. Isn't that what you wanted? I'm surprised to say it out loud, but... no. [man panting] I'm happy with what I got. What? But what do you mean by that? How? "Happy with what I got?" - [kids clamoring] - [water sloshing] [seagulls warbling] Hi. Hi. I'll help you. For Antek's sake. [emotional music playing] Aren't you worried I'll steal Enzo from you? [Ewa sighing] I'm sorry, Monika I never meant to hurt you. I just thought Enzo could be my chance. It's tough to make a living being an artist. And I'm in a lot of debt with a child to take care of. It's not that I didn't do all I could. I borrowed money, and gambled. And once I even... I even came close to getting married to a wealthy fertilizer manufacturer. [Monika chuckling] It wasn't what you and Enzo have, though. What is that? Love. Mommy, what now? - Oh! Come here! - [Monika] Now I will take care of you. Oh no, darling. You have a wedding and your own stuff to deal with. The wedding is off. And now we have more important things to do. We have to find you an apartment. Come here, little one, you can help me out. - Follow her. - [Monika] Because this suitcase is heavy! Just like you! Oh my goodness! [somber music playing] [cell phone chiming] TODAY IS YOUR WEDDING [Enzo sighing] ♪ Colored lights, a million faces ♪ TODAY IS YOUR WEDDING ♪ You see her there And suddenly she goes ♪ ♪ Feeling like you're about to fall ♪ ♪ You need someone to catch and hold you ♪ ♪ She turns around and suddenly you know ♪ [Monika sniffling] [indistinct chatter] [music fades] [Damian sighing] Hi, darling. You're here? I thought you left yesterday? Well, I've been thinking a lot, and... I'd love to stay here a little while longer if... if I can. Well, of course you can. [birds chirping] I want to apologize, Mom. Um, to you too, Bazyli. [sighing] I felt quite stupid and also embarrassed not to be here with my Mom. Thank you for everything you're doing for her. Friends? Okay. Shall we go in? What are we waiting for? Well, this time, for my children to come to their senses. [all chuckling] That's good. [Monika] This is a weird route. Why is it a weird route? Where's that restaurant? [Jacek] It's pretty close. And, you know, it's a special kind of restaurant. - What are you hiding? - I'm not hiding anything. What if I wanted to go back home? [exhaling] Well... - Jacek? - [Jacek] Yeah? What's going on? Nothing's going on. I just... didn't quite call off the wedding. What? [dramatic orchestral music playing] What the heck are we doing here? You have pantyhose on? You hate wearing pantyhose. You didn't call off the wedding. Stop lying to yourself. You can't live without her. And if you don't wanna get married, just call it off yourself. [Enzo seething] [music fades] Do you wanna go first? No. Do you? I dream of becoming a father. [birds chirping] And I'm not yet ready to be a mom. [organ music playing] [indistinct chatter] [Antek exhaling] I'm bored... What's wrong? I'm just bored. [bells chiming] [music fades] [man coughing] So this is it? [dramatic music playing] Should we call it off? It seems that way. Sometimes you have to let things go. At least we gave it our best effort. You're the best thing that's ever happened in my life. And even though we have to split up, I will always love you. [organ music playing] [inaudible] [bells tolling] [jaunty organ music playing] [crowd murmuring] [Wiktor clearing throat] All right. - It's time to begin. - But it's not really... I said it's time to begin. [man coughing] [uplifting music playing] [Wiktor] Come here, my angels. [crowd cheering] [man] Yes! Finally! [Wiesiek] Hey! Hold on! Hold it! One moment! [panting] I'm here! I made it, people! [both laughing] Sorry. My car broke down. [wedding march playing] [crowd gasping] Antek, come here. [music fades] Sit down, please. Honey really is the ultimate form of perfection in the animal kingdom. [uplifting music playing] Among people, the honey is love. Sometimes it comes unexpectedly by looking into a person's eyes, and you immediately can tell that they must be the one. It's not just a spark, not just an infatuation, But it embodies genuine love. And you know this is it. [Wiktor sighing] This is called love squared.
