[Music] and good day to you today I've traveled out into the deepest Suffolk to the small hamlet of showand to a very unusual church throat chapel which is King Charles the martyr church it's only one of five in England dedicated to the memory of King Charles first and what a lovely church is very plain very simple it's known as a done native Church in short there existed here until 1646 a medieval church which was in ruins as a result of the Reformation a local landowner a man believed as Thomas Crocky decided to rebuild the church and dedicated to the memory of the king who as many of students of history will know wasn't extremely unpopular King and particularly so with Parliament and certainly autocratic in his role and eventually the English grew tired of him and he was publicly executed so for Thomas crock Lee during the period of the English Civil War to dedicate this church to King Charles the first is quite an amazing feat which he managed to get away with unfortunately by 1659 Thomas crop Lee had died and actually missed the return of royal patronage in the form of King Charles a second who was invited from France to take the front of England but this doe native Chapel was survived by the beneficiaries of local landowners and I believe in 1767 further work was carried out on to the church and particularly so with the front porch which was added then so what we have is a collection basically of three different styles of architecture which are brought together into this one building is early as in the 14th century to the 17th century when the church was rebuilt from ruin and to further improvements in the 18th century and the church this day still stands and is still useful Christian worship and I find holding experience being here and particularly so in such a rare Church quite fascinating and looking around being I could admire the Georgian architecture which is fits a particular style that I'm fond of and to see the box pews and the triple pulpit and the general layout and ambience with the pastel colors have been used inside this building is simply something to behold and for those of you that live further afield it is a place that is worth visiting should you ever get the opportunity to come here well I'm actually standing here I'm just glancing across on the right-hand side of the nave going towards the chancel there is a wooden block with three pegs on it those three pegs are actually for the Georgians to hang there weeks on so they were satya and a particularly hot day a very hot servant they would take off their wigs and they would hang them from those wooden pegs how unusual is that and still here one hoping to do now is to introduce you more into the rest of the church and have a wander down towards the chancel and I hope you can join me there just lovely stunning inside this box pew anyway what we have here as you can see is the top part of an arch probably a window or perhaps a small doorway for some purpose which obviously has been filled in and the plaster over the centuries because of dampness has probably caused it to fall away exposing the rough caught underneath which gives you some idea of how this church was constructed I wonder what other prizes a way to restore as in 90 years though actually hidden underneath the plaster of the existing church but anyway I digress isn't it wonderful the fact that you can see it the fact that it's here the last vestige of the 14th century and here it is what I particularly love which is something that perhaps isn't noted by many people when coming into a church here we have the aisle and on this side we have the chancel but before the chancel this is not an altar gate is a gate and the purpose of which and you can tell by the narrow ballast ballast rods is the purpose is to stop dogs from actually wandering into the otter and chancel area so one can assume centuries ago when people came here to worship they brought with them their pets probably sent inside these Box pews you can imagine the dogs barking the babies screaming their heads off it must have been quite a community affair here but they thought it necessary at some point to incorporate this round gate so it's quite an unusual find and quite welcomed because it tells you just a little bit more about the history of this one Chappell it's wonderful isn't it that's wonderful it's quite interesting standing inside the chancel there are a number of grey plates markers two people that have lived in the community and there are commemorative plates carved in memory of Thomas crop leaf the man that saved this church I wonder if mr. crappie is still keeping a watchful eye over the church and the parishioners because the church is existence here is quite perilous in some degree it is miles from any large settlement of humans sits in a very small country Hamlet you just get the odd vehicle that rolls pastan to be honest it's quite easy for people to come here and actually miss the church to drive home I was lucky today I was able to spot it as soon as I've got here and what a lovely building it is what a beautiful atmosphere that's here it's very light very Airy not at all aggressive or on edge just a light pleasantry here we actually have a woven cloth screen or covering and it actually goes all the way 1/2 level around the walls up to the altar and it's crested by these beautifully carved and quite sharply pointed rather and what an attractive piece it is and again something that you wouldn't expect to find inside a church certainly not a present church keeping you too rather restrained less flamboyant styling we have something that kind of riches outdoor bit further is trying to share something a little bit more than what you would expect to find inside the church and here it is it's just wonderful wasn't there I'm actually going to stand in the chance from now to see if I can actually touch base with any type of spiritual behavior let's have a look the atmosphere here is light Pleasant always a good audience I find in most churches may not be the wealthy Church but it's certainly one that's been greatly enjoyed over the centuries I just going to have disappearing let's see we're gonna get any response as you can hear it's definitely quite here there's no air ball flying over and just the odd car that just happens packed by mistake to drive past it's out in the middle of nowhere I come here in love I in peace I mean no harm disrespect I just wish to make peaceful and friendly contact with any spiritual presences within this beautiful church can anyone give me an indication clear that their presence here okay I'm feeling the presence of a past I believe it to be this person to be a past priest probably going back to the latter part the 1830 part of 19th century this man is probably in his sixties is quite bald it's got a lot of gray hair either side over his is quite scruffy in a way really not what one would expect from a priest but he's a very jovial person big smiling face wearing round Bryn's glasses very thin wire framed glasses he's teeth appear to be stained I can't honestly tell you why I'm saying that I'm thinking that that's why I'm picking up I can say that this man I believe his first thing was James a very kindly cheery kind of fellow I see him with a big smile very kind very positive imagery of this person and as I'm looking at these box pews now I'm seeing a huddled mass inside each of the sections with a head down deep so all I'm actually seeing from here is just the tops of their heads as had been offering prayer and I imagine the chaos in here on a Sunday sermon and of course with the knowledge and the fact that Doc's used to come into this church and were a persistent problem and the fact that families would have come with their children and babies Wow it's almost like a circus atmosphere here people coming going people chatting to each other during the sermon and yet all perfectly acceptable it is strange when you wander into these places that you've never visited previously in your life then you're imbued this history I'm going to stand quietly in the silence and see what happens could you give me a sign please could you make a noise could you touch something could you give an indication of your presence please the person I'm having with this man is just edging around here just doing his daily chores doesn't seem to be a connection between him and he the realm and myself in this time almost a residual energy as it were my particular one I'm standing here looking back now into the nave or the appearance hanging from the rafters of three oil Victorian almost no less sadly converted to electricity because one can imagine what it must have been like in the old days before electricity to see them lit at night but anyway they're here and they had a certain cultural identity to this church as a family Church a rural family church and she's standing here of course I'm looking back towards what with the beam where the organ is and that's something I need to touch on with you very shortly but the organ is the role crest of King Charles the first they must be as rare as hen's teeth other than the five churches that we know about there cannot be many representations of Charles's coat of arms anywhere else in the United Kingdom it's absolutely splendid it's just wonderful being here I'm feeling a little bit sick now I don't know why I am a little bit nauseous well can you stand back please I don't know who this is it's not that man that I picked up earlier I'm feeling very windy should we say just easing away now which is over whelmed by war or sickness I mean what can imagine you see when we look back into history most families were large incredibly large ain't knowing children and the reason for that was simply that because of the lack of medical care available at that period of history many many people died in their development from many of course then actually rich beyond their childhood so there was a necessity to have as big as families as a possible and a hope that one of them would survive the majority of course would pass away being prescribed as dying from consumption but there were an array of diseases which were incurable and so if you were struck with a life-threatening illness it was just literally being in the hands of God as to whether or not you would survive and if you did survive you would come here and you would give your things to God because there was nothing else and that feeling of nausea it kind of encapsulates those feelings of thoughts a simple plane is what this church is is a very attractive Church and its simplicity it's why I'd like about some Protestant churches I find some traditional older Catholic churches particularly abroad in Italy or elsewhere tend to be overly aeration in colors and their ornamentation very very heavy with statues of angels and of saints and of famous people who were buried in these churches here it is kept to the minimum you focus upon your worship of God and not alluding to allow yourself to be sucked in by the decorations that were particularly favored in the past by the Catholic Church as a sign of wealth a sign of power and the Protestants wanted to evolve away from that to keep everything regulated plain and simple you come here to worship God not to avoid a statuary or the paintings of a gold colored paintwork that you find in many of those churches of course we should also remember that during the reign of the Catholic Church in this country there are many many beautiful works of art as of all paintings frescoes sadly of which of course many of long since disappeared following the Reformation they Weaver painted over or in plastered how unusual I've been here three hours and I've just heard a jet fly over anyway I want to share with you something special which is the organ and I'll tell you more than we get there all the way down towards the font is something which is extremely unusual inside any churches a triple-decker pulpit and this piece is quite amazing and if you imagine in the priests standing there full of fire brimstone and delivering the message of God to the heathens quite amazing I forgive me for my imagination I particularly love about this is that the top and middle pour pits are decorated with a grade a cloth rate with tassels I think probably at one time this may have been a screen which was home down by the sides but of course has long since gone it's fairly worn now but a number of the tassel still exists but what beautiful structure standing with surety assertiveness over over this tiny congregation it's just wonderful anyway let's go down to the font what we have here essentially is a 14th century font beautifully carved with a sprawling and patterning and it's cat by a Georgian pineapple topped covering so there you have the fusion between the 14th century and 18th century merged together here in one piece and the only identifiable relic of the earlier church apart from that broken window that I showed you earlier and it's beautiful absolutely wonderful and it survived all those centuries being stood and he hearing noises in the background there are some men in the field shooting but this is lovely the real joy is the actual organ itself what we have here is the only one of its type in Suffolk it is a barrel organ it can play 36 different tunes and was installed here in the year 1820 unfortunately I can't access the barrel organ to play it and I certainly wouldn't want to without somebody being present but one can imagine the sort of hurdy-gurdy sound of music that will be played out inside to the congregation here it's lovely isn't it absolutely marvelous all the pipes are here all properly preserved and it's in full working order is just amazing yes a lovely church why proposed to do now is to actually sit inside one of the box pews and see whether or not we can troll through energy in the form of EVP or perhaps some type of occurrence I don't feel anything hostile here at all just mild and pleasant and lovely Church and certainly pleased that I've actually made the effort to come out here today anyway that's come down everything here's on highs and that the barrel organ is on high the pulpit is on high some churches depending on their own religious convictions wanted to level the playing field so anything that separated the congregation from the otter and from the church itself was removed and so many of these box pews were ripped out in later years and in some churches the altar was actually lowered so that it could be on the same level as the rest of the congregation which perhaps was an early indication within the Church of an equality as such between the church and the common folk and of course the landowners I'm going to sit in this box here and hopefully draw something through which could be interesting I love these doors just being so here there is the impression of a woman 19th century very dark clothing literally from her neck long way down to her feet huge skirt dress probably a lady who lady in her 70s quite elderly a very strongly weather-worn face her hands are very very rough opsi a lady that has experienced a lifetime of toil and yet here I can feel her I can see her actually tidying the church keeping it clean so one of the church helpers perhaps but she's here and again just like the priest she's completely circumstan the fact I'm here is it a residual energy I don't know why she's here please could you give me a sign of your presence could you say something could you give me some indication of your presence here there's a strange smell a smell of cooking smell of all vegetables both me the kind of smell that you expect on people's clothing if they've been cooking wearing the same clothes a bit like when people fry and fry food the stench of they soaks into their clothing and here I can smell this pot boil for want of a better word an old smell a smell that's been on someone's clothes for a while yes there's a number of strange odors floating around it here it's difficult to describe them all but they're here a very earthy country smell I think so many echoes from the past here and to be honest if anyone came back to his church from the I don't know maybe the 19th century nothing here would look at miss just amazing a time capsule stepping back and it's here if I hear any noises I will report them I'm not hearing anything okay it's time for me to return back to Essex I really enjoyed this trip out here today took over an hour and a quarter to get here but it's certainly worthwhile for the isolation of this place simply wonderful absolutely wonderful anyway without much ado thank you for joining me today and I look forward again to seeing you the next time so until then from me to you take [Music] this is totally incredible an amazing building I'm actually at Lawrence's Church in the village of Broughton in Buckinghamshire Broughton today is a small part of a much larger entity which is the new town of Milton Keynes and this church was erected in the 14th and 15th centuries and covers wall art dating from the 15th 16th and 17th centuries so effectively we're looking at artwork from the pre-reformation and post-reformation periods and what an incredible array of pictures we have here to share with you plus the ambience of this building in 18-49 whilst rebuilding the chancel to the church they accidentally discovered under years and years of whitewash some beautiful medieval wall paintings now before the Reformation of the church many people were peasants they were unable to read or write and so it was necessary for the church to paint vivid religious descriptions to keep the worshipers and congregation in order nobody today knows who these artists were but there were clear reminder of times past in a very harsh and cruel world and that is the world of the medieval after the Reformation period things changed somewhat the original wall paintings were painted over and they were replaced by short Psalms and prayers which were far more subtler and gentler and really just to encourage and remind people of their loyalty and allegiance to God in this place of worship the church was declared redundant in 1987 and was handed into the care of the church's conservation trust and is no longer used for worship and indeed today it is regarded more as a museum the building is grade 1 listed because of the fantastic artwork that surrounds you when you walk into this building and the ambience generated from it is something very special including the bells of the church which always strike on the owl the first painting I want to reference here today is actually above the North doorway as you come into the church you can see it directly in front of you in many churches that you go into you often find some Christopher as a welcoming gesture as you enter the church here the message is much more staid and much more certain about your future because here above the North doorway is judgment unfortunately the wall painting has been compromised bytes Victorian uncovering and repainting which makes it hard exactly to date and gives a scheme essential look the upper part of the painting has been lost so only the left foot and Rover Christ survives however many other details are clear wars and tales of the heavenly city on the left-hand side and we have an angel blowing the last trumpet to summon the dead to rise to come to be judged and we have an angel with a sword on the top right-hand corner which is possibly the angel of expulsion which guarded the door to the edan in the bottom center we have the weighing of souls with the Virgin Mary sheltering souls in the cloak and holding a huge string of prayer beads and some Michael holding the scouts of the right originally it would have been shown spearing the demon at his feet as he tried to weigh down the scout in the weighing of souls and what could not be better than the mouth of hell complete with sharp teeth and souls licked by flames [Music] tomorr writing on the wall is a painting depicting a lamentation or Peter which was painted in the year fourteen seventy and has nine wrote medieval figures carrying parts of Christ's body the painting depicts Christ in the arms of his mother and as you can see his right arm and leg are broken and mutilated the central scene is surrounded by the nine men who carry portions of the body of Jesus bones limbs etc one carries the Sacred Heart another the sacred host the body of Christ in the consecrated bread of the Eucharist at the bottom of the pitcher two men quarrel over a game of backgammon it's been suggested that one of the purposes of this painting was a warning to medieval people that they injured our Lord on they swore oaths black parts of his body so as you can see another example of how the church exerted authority across the peasantry so if you misbehaved Christ would be the one who would suffer and of course when you died and your soul passed on you would suffer you would be condemned to an eternity of health and not abide by the laws of Christ this is all fairly heavy stuff but for the period of history in which these were planted these were terrible times there was plays there was diseases all kinds of terrible maladies wars conflicts disagreements many many ways for people to die slow and miserable deaths and so the important thing that most people wanted was salvation at the end of this if they were to die having suffered such a terrible life [Music] in this depiction which is painted above the south doorway as you enter into the church isn't George riding a horse spearing a dragon at his feet unfortunately the top part of st. George is missing this is due to the fact that in the 15th century the church decided to lower the roof and so the top part which would have shown some charge his helmet has completely gone and so there are no references to that today but what's left there is quite remarkable to say the very least the artwork of the dragon is particularly intriguing very very beautiful as indeed other parts of the exposed horse and the lower parts in George's body and of course emblazoned across in George's chess is a red cross on a white background which coincidentally is also the flag of England and so since George became the patron saint of England but who was sin George the man the worse than jaws was born in Cappadocia which is now in Turkey in around the year to 80 AD he enlisted into the cavalry of the Roman army at the age of 17 during the reign of the Emperor Diocletian Diocletian second in command was Galeras the conqueror of Persia and an avid supporter of the pagan religion and as a result for the rumor the Christians were plotting the death of Galerius an edict was issued that all Christian churches were to be destroyed and all scriptures to be burnt anyone omitting to being a Christian would lose his rights as a citizen if not his life son George acted to limit the excesses of diocletian's actions it tanks the Christians he went to the city of Nicomedia where upon entering he tore down the notice of the Emperor's edict when he appeared before Diocletian it said this and George bravely denounced him for his unnecessary cruelty and injustice and subsequently Stan George having defended his faith was beheaded at nikka media near Lydia in Palestine on the 23rd of April in the year 303 ad within the context of this wall painting the dragon would have been some form of demon and also and a more subtle message to the peasantry of the medieval England of that period it would also have been a warning to other faiths who did not conform to the teachings of Christ and so San Jorge as in his historic context of being a supporter of early Christianity was still defending the faith by vanquishing all foes that stand before God [Music] [Music] [Music] one wall painting which is seldom seen by the public is now actually covered by the organ which was placed here in 1993 having originally stood inside the otter area of the church in the chancel and that is actually the Lord's Prayer and if you look very carefully above the pipes of the bat you can actually see the depictions of the lettering showing part of the prayers it runs down the wall where the rest of the prayer is there today I honestly can't answer but I understand that there is still quite degree of wall painting which has been left and what an amazing find amongst all the other amazing finds that I've discovered here today and now we move across to the next depicted wall painting which is an Eligius and st. Helena both have historic connections particularly so to the Church of Rome to the Catholic faith in England and also to the Eastern Orthodox Church as well as in later years perhaps to a lesser degree the Church of England [Music] as we can see certainly GEOSS is holding in one hand the bishops crows II or crook he's wearing the clothing of a bishop and he is raising one hand up to God on one hand on the staff and if you look very closely and particularly beneath the depiction you'll see a number of images which are painted on the walls which depict many implements and objects which were created by metalsmiths and metal workers and Goldsmith's etc because the Eligius is the patron saint of Goldsmith's and metal workers the only problem of course there is a monument plate across these depictions so we've only got a partial representation of what is actually their Eligius was an interesting character was an early Christian bishop who certainly found favor with a king of that period he was born in France in around 660 AD and very quickly rose to prominence and became a close confidant and friend of the king of that period certainly during his lifetime as a young man he was a skilled metalworker and was alleged to have created a beautiful gold throne for the king which obviously in noble his favor to the said Regent the story is that he came across once a horse which refused to be reshot by a blacksmith and the horse became unruly and so some Eligius rode the horse was possessed by demons and as an act of faith to his belief and his religion he chopped off one of the four legs of the horse and rishaad the limb and then miraculously reattached it back to the animal's body and the demons were gone and the animal returned to normal this was regarded as being an amazing act and particularly so within the teachings of the Catholic Church of that period and so that earned him sainthood but the reality of cently Jia's was apart from being the patron saint of metalworkers and blacksmith he was a skilled goldsmith was the fact that he was an important power player and the early part of the last millennium and is also noted as being one who converted the Gauls and the Franks into the Christian faith but of course after the Reformation characters makes the Eligius very quickly disappeared from Fame and to his left is some Helena the mother of the Emperor Constantine and she was certainly a very powerful figure and was perhaps one of those instrumental in his conversion to the Christian faith it's said that she traveled to the Middle East with a view to finding the cross upon which Christ was crucified and eventually came across three crucifixes and in order to prove upon which one was the original crucifix upon which Christ was crucified she found a port and very seriously ill old lady and instructed her to touch these three crosses the first two she touched there was no effect but upon touching the third which is the one which is depicted here the lady was miraculously cured of all ills and was joyous and happy and again another miracle [Music] one can appreciate having experienced the harshness of the rule of the Church of Rome up to the Reformation the Protestants wished to have a more softer tone and approach and so basically rather than reinforcing their will upon you they're pleading to you they're saying look if you don't worship God if you don't believe in God then the words of God and the church itself will fade effectively so rather than in forcing people to worship people were being embraced by the church to worship which is a completely different doctrine to that of the past and bearing a line of course for the 17th century there were a lot more people that were much better educated and could make their own mind and decide how they wish to worship God if indeed at all they wanted to visit or worship in this church and that I think is the theme that's followed through and there are many other textual entries with quotations from the Bible but to reiterate there is nothing there which shows the harshness of the previous years and sadly this is where the church follows through because after this period and particularly after the restorations which had taken place here all the medieval glass which previously existed is long gone and has been replaced by a number of beautiful panels by Victorian artists and sadly like the way of many churches of this vintage in later years the congregation's dwindled and effectively faded away and so the relevance and the power of the church was no longer regarded as being something essential to most people's lives and the strange irony as I said earlier when we first arrived the entire surroundings of where we are is now filled with housing milton keynes has expanded and spread out and a swallow to the village of rosen perhaps in later years there may be a recall to worship here as a church or perhaps not it will continue as a museum but as I've often mentioned on many my visits what happens in future centuries how will these buildings be loved and maintained and there is every possible risk that if people don't appreciate the significance of what these buildings really represent which is a historical record of our past they too will fade into history and that will be something regrettable and something that cannot ever be replaced [Music] since I've been in here filming I've actually met a very interesting man a man but name of Barry Waites and and what is your responsibility and interest with his church well I'm a member of the Friends of some Laurent formed just over a year ago to ensure that the church has is open to the public it has always been possible for for people to come to us at Lawrence's and get the key and walk around but we wanted to use it more as a community resource because there's now new building surrounding the area and there are many people expressing an interest in the building and seeing it as a centre of the community now you've got a book here which dates to when roughly Barry 1567 and it's a defence of the apology of the Church of England so what prompted this book well after Henry the eighth made himself head of the Church of England and as in fact as you go through that period of Edward the six the Protestant Reformation by the time you get to and death by the time you get to the reign of Queen Elizabeth there was now a very clear distinction between the church in England that had left the fold of the Roman Catholic Church and we shouldn't forget that Elizabeth was excommunicated by the Pope which prompted the Duke of Parma to launch an invasion exactly this book was printed was printed it is an argument against the Roman Catholic Church which says that it was the English church that carried on the true tradition of Catholicism and not the Church of Rome which was corrupt and it is in Old English script it is called black letter actually and it's very difficult to read it's beautiful though isn't it artistically it is it is very very beautiful and it's it's a very learn ed book and it's full of references referring to other sources in which he brings to his aid all of these sources including quotes from the Bible a horrible heresy sent Agostini's faith or something it says up here and so really this was a defense of the Church of England that's right yeah it's it's argument why it was better than the Church of Rome and and why people should abide by the teachings yes it says that in fact the English church had gone back to its origins we are the English church and we are the true English Catholic Church and always have been and of course this is also a representational of evolution in society how people's concepts were changing how they viewed things much more differently to the earlier teachings that he received under the Church of Rome and you just - what we're talking about this you've got another book over here the paraphrase of Erasmus would it be 1517 1523 to the church in 1632 was a Dutch scholar he was originally a Catholic and he also became King James the First's tutor by which time he was a Protestant and that's James the first came to be not only a Protestant because he was the daughter of the Catholic Mary Queen of Scots but also as a successor to Elizabeth and he erasmus translated the whole of the new testament into latin but rewritten for to give greater understanding and the idea Henry the eighth's wife catherine parr she was the final one and the one that survived it was her idea that her as mrs. gospel should be translated into english and believe it or not some Queen Mary who was actually one of the translators who translated she became known as Bloody Mary and took the church back to Catholicism but she is believed to have translated the Gospel of st. John so despite her she would say homicide or sight she was also an academic I understand that being an organist here you're actually gonna pay ass out with she would say a more really suitable tune yes many people who come to services see it still as a village church what else do you expect in an English village church but something like I vow to thee my country to host you Gustav Holst yeah it's only a smaller than but many people love to hear it and and they do say it just brings memories flooding back it's very emotional piece and especially when it's accompanied by singing it is a very powerful piece [Music] like all good things the day has come to an end and I've thoroughly enjoyed my visit to some Lawrence Church and particularly in the company of Barry Watson who is one of the friends of some Lawrence church the church is Conservation Trust control an amazing array of churches across England this being one of many and if you get the opportunity to visit this church you must do so it is worth a journey I actually spoke to a couple earlier that had traveled down from Newcastle to actually visit this wonderful building and so I'm sure hopefully after today you will be driven to come down here and experience the same joys and pleasures that I have, [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm actually standing inside one of the great religious houses of England in fact this vast expanse of ruins once represented a vital part of the economy of this area of thetford in Norfolk but before we actually go on with an investigation and touch base with some of the historical background of this remarkable location a short while earlier on our way up here we stopped over at the village of great live Amir in Southwark to meet up with one of England's greatest ghost tellers a man by the name of Montague Rhodes James and here is my report you it is seldom that in life you get the opportunity to pay homage to one of your heroes and I think for me one of my literary hero is as a man by name of Montague Rhodes James more commonly known as the author M R James who is regarded as a father of the antiquarian ghost story he was an academic he spent much of his life at university and the end of these days Eton but for the best part of 40 years his family had to living here as far was the priest he arrived here at the age of three with his family and was associated with this village for over 40 years in fact his art of writing ghost stories was legendary apart from being a great scholarly academic into medieval life no doubt he had a certain acting ability because he used to enthrall and entrace his students with his stories which she had written especially for them he also based many of his other stories on locations associated or known to him through his family and friends old Burr and Suffolk B one other place that comes to mind but the main thing about Montague Rhodes James was that he wrote a template for the modern ghost story many of em are James's works have been adapted for television two of his compositions were written around this village one was called a vignette and the other was entitled simply rats so one can imagine what an honor it must have been to be in the presence of this great man and although he died eaten and was buried there a plaque remains today to the genius of Montague rose James inside some Peter's Church and now we're returning back to Thetford which is the seat for today's investigations and ghostly historical connections that was certainly an interesting visit to the home of Mr James a man who for many many years has entertained me with his wonderful ghost stories and now we are actually standing inside the remains of a clinic Priory which was built in the 12th century right in the middle of fete furred in Norfolk as with many ancient and abandoned sites across Britain and this site was abandoned in the year 1540 after the dissolution of the Catholic Church in England one can imagine the ghostly legends that have attached themselves to these places some of those perhaps were created deliberately to keep people way to stop people causing the nuisance of damaging the site or perhaps for more Nefera sack tivities such as smuggling on the other hand there is also a lot of residual energy left over from the period in which the monks were here and certainly in 1937 a group of people passing through here one evening could hear monks singing and also heard a monk reading from some ghostly text and of course more recently in 1991 a group of teenagers passing through here also could hear ghostly music and not only that they actually saw a monk and they were attracted to his presence by the sound of keys clanking in the darkness and you can imagine the sheer terror that they must have suffered before they decamped from this location very quickly unfortunately the site is owned by English heritage and so after 6:00 p.m. at night the entire site is shut down but it still does not stop people from climbing in here to carry out their own investigations although for ourselves tonight we have another but very special location in Thetford forest itself and let's not forget more recent history we have the Bell Hotel or the belly we actually called in there earlier today to see whether or not we could get interviews or perhaps film inside the location but the staff we spoke to the having heard these are reputations in ghostly tales claim that none of this has affected them and that they haven't experienced any activity whatsoever although they did say if you go into the cellars down below where it's very cold and very damp there is a pervasive atmosphere in there which is particularly scary and something which makes the staff feel very uncomfortable about before they have to depart from the cell cellars very quickly so unfortunately as much as I would love to be able to investigate some of the legends attached to the Bell in I can report that a member of staff was allegedly locked in by ghostly hands into a room and that there is a lady who has been she was say in residence for a number of years who haunts the premises but unfortunately of course again because it is a commercial business and because there is a lot of people passing in and out it wasn't a practical location for us to be able to carry through any type of investigation and just one more other thing I'd like to cover for our american friends the great thomas paine originated from Thetford before moving to London and eventually to America where he ignited the spirit of the Revolution which occurred in 1776 and Payne today is a favored son of of the actual town and if you travel around there are plenty of monuments and plaques to this great man so all in all the fit furred site is for many many reasons a great place to explore but perhaps to a degree the town has been contaminated by the modern world and from my point of view that does not make for a good paranormal investigation unless you're standing inside a very unusual and perhaps unique building this dates from the 13th century and is a solid squat tower it has two stories we have an upper floor and a lower floor and many people would probably think that this was some kind of a prison but in fact it's actually a warren is lodge a Warriner was a person employed to catch wild rabbits as Jane for food and the reason we built this unusual building was because this land was owned by the Priory at fete furred and the Warner's were being attacked by Roman gangs for the game that they had actually caught or they were attacked by poachers so in order to defend this position and to save their lives the abbot had this unusual building erected after the disillusioning 1540 the whole building was handed over into the estates of the Harald family and the house family kept and maintained this structure until the early part of the 20th century and over the centuries the forests here was regarded as one of the best for catching wild rabbits and what would happen is that on the upper floor the Warriner or the hunting party would sleep on the lower floor the dead rabbits would be stored for transportation back to Thetford the following day it has a number of ghostly tales attached to it one I think was perhaps created as a method to keep people away from here and the other is perhaps a more chilling tale which I will share with you the one I think that was confection was the tale of the white rabbit with a red glowing eyes and believe me or not this is quite a savage beast he's alleged that should you see this white rabbit with a red glowing eyes you die within 24 hours I personally think that the story is a little bit far-fetched that I haven't heard of anybody who's actually suffered from this terrible calamity of seeing this frightful apparition of a rabbit but certainly there's another story which is one that I'm hoping we can follow up this evening by tearing out our own the investigation of this building we can actually get inside the building because there is a metal grill behind us and it has a roof but there's enough space for me here to reach forward into the structure with a camcorder and perhaps may be able to pick up something interesting the other the other story is about really a girl and this girl is a man with no eyes and no mouth but just black holes for sockets and has a two-dimensional face and his face according to legend has appeared on the ground floor and upper floor levels and I believe 20 years ago somebody walking through here at night actually saw this face leering at them from the ground floor and they fled in terror whether or not tonight we will encounter the spirit I don't know but I'm pretty sure we should pick up some good quality EVP at this location and perhaps some other strange apparitions keep hearing whispering all the time whispering and I think that somebody following you can see what this is well I think this is effective I used to be called God robes and basically their toilet shoots so on the upper floor if anybody was using this as a toilet it would come directly down this chute and you'd be deposited down the bottom here for clearing up the following day and of course the lowest of the low were employed to do those kind of jobs but I think this is the remains of a Garda robe interesting we've now returned back to fitfoods Warren Lodge on the edge of Thetford forest it's not too cold it's quite nice it's certainly very very quiet there's a lot of activity around us as far as nature we we've actually seen what you think is a deer on the way through and what we intend to do is to video around this building and also perhaps a little bit into the forest I've just had a look inside through the grille and there's certainly a strong energy here so I'm hopeful that we're going to pick up something really worth sharing with you so let's crack on with our investigation nothing really yeah what can you think just say but when I first focus in where you want this I'm not sure about restaurant a nothing particular I don't sure sort of lie out there nothing on here no I'm not she'd film you okay shots it's alway next year nothing belong to that yourself just that won't be long if anything what you should be doing is standing away from the building so you can get as much in view and what you commit you to you view what you viewed what that's exactly their way of doing it looking around the outskirts that way don't you do the same the other side I'll get some shots yeah got a light at the top in one of the windows and all I love these windows his slits in the sand I'm feeling getting an irritation about us now I just took a picture inside and the instant have actually taken it I felt this tremendous irritation an impertinence that we are taking photographs of creating lights you say inside that building I just get the impression that somebody would rather we kept it quiet and of course we will do and we're not staying here forever but it is a very strong irritation to stay in realeased but we just can they keep wandering around the outskirts in this building there isn't a great deal of other places to go to we're actually in the middle of a large clearing from the forest so we're not right on the edge of the forest but it's interesting I'm picking up a name a first for I thought he was the surname was something like turbo octobot Thabo but the name I'm picking up is William Taverner William Taverner whoever he was one of the Warner's here the rabbit hunters I don't know the name is striking that he very very strongly at the moment is William Cavanaugh I'm picking up something I just want to find out what it is can you show yourself please I can fill you I know you're here I haven't come here to cause you any any inconvenience well at least I hope I'm not calling you that I've just come here to make friendly and peaceful contact with you it's very difficult with these bars but literally can you tell me your name please is it William Cavanaugh it's one of the five places and then that's the fireplace on the upper deck doesn't really give you a lot of scope it's internet although there's nowhere else we can't there's no no there's none of it can't get to open it so you know no yeah it's just the bars or new convenience please could you say something one of these windows there's where a face appears some of them will windows where there are no more than arrow slits so you're never going to see a face they're basically a mini fall isn't it yeah fortified farms over the north it's you know it's a it's accomodation with a military purpose but you're not fighting over armies you're fighting thieves and brigands please could you say something could you make a noise could you give us some indication of your presence please superstone I'm sorry I'll just stick him up a bit for a minute so you just step back now just for a second what we actually are we doing for taunting I think it's cool to happen and I think it's cool to happen still feels lighter than that oh for sure for sure I'm just going to step out here a little bit further what did what the building in what way did it make you feel we felt what headed no it's very very active here's a beautiful building so those that inhabit this wonderful building III do understand how much many many of those and spirit wants to return back to the places they knew in life and they certainly do not want to be interfered with and I haven't come to do that and I do understand I'm just here to try make a measured contact level with you and I have no intentions of returning so I'm just but a visitor and I'm not a child and I haven't come here to cause a nuisance and I know that you've obviously suffered with that in the past and I know that the world in pond which I live in is nothing like the world from which you came I wondered if anybody here met the prior of thethird because you supplied his kitchen I'll get the impression you know with the Warner's there was always a military presence here you know and pick up men arms yeah a couple of soldiers it's very difficult for these plastic really for anyone watching - to get a really good appraisal of what is actually here and all I can give you on and I do apologize I just snippets through these bars but as you can see with the wind dies around it was definitely a fortified tower some over the centuries have become bigger I was are still in the original format give you not here the thickness of these walls look amazingly strong building and all for the humble rabbit yes you know yeah that's all yeah that's all work Roman style they've used in there I started really neat job only and if you look at the bottom here you can just take capture somewhere on here the edge of work stone like a like a like an almond archway so this must have been quite decorative in its heyday yeah I'm picking up two soldiers here two minute arms and maybe three of them in the Warrens and also dogs dogs too yeah small Terrier dogs so really intriguing place isn't it Oh Oh something we just went up wall yeah unlike form I hope it was it maybe in a moth but oh yeah on the right it seemed like a streak but and then I saw more so I'm not so sure but a certainly I'll check it on the film anytime is ability could fall in love with you that oh absolutely yeah it's a it's a very charming place it has a certain atmosphere and to think that we are where I'm standing here I'm actually a part of it so much you standing inside a medieval building and this would have also would have been used for prayer as well Tim there would have been a small chapel area for prayer such was the requirements of the day not so much I'm certainly feeling but I'm not seeing as much as I expected to I think what we'll do now I think we're local it quits and make our way back to the car it's a very very dodgy ground here we're walking across a sandpit so you can imagine how dangerous it is under thought but we can do it [Music] [Music] [Music] or today I'm at the medieval church of Samaria virgin that stances mountfitchett in Essex surprise me in a very quiet very surreal building in its own way it has a lot of very early church architecture particularly family walks the memorials and even there's an effigy of a knight as you can see here cast in stone but what is very sad about this building is that it is no longer used for worship and belongs to the churches Conservation Trust and it is open for public inspection what we're hoping to do today is to wander around the church and be able to touch in and touch base rather with the energies that prevail here and with me today and joining me for the first time is my dear friend Mary Priya who has come all the way over to the UK from the United States of America it's got here from the state's actually we just came from the airport to check out this very very old church it's very beautiful and there's a lot of things to look at so we'll show you around this church just walking around has its own special magic I've been trying to tap into energies within the building and the strongest at the moment which is the moment two famous people buried here but what's interesting here I'm very spooky if you can get that on the camera down here Mary it's the human skulls that are carved into the feet of the of the actual sarcophagus that's really really weird and there's one over here to look and the family to whom this is dedicated to is the Middleton family and obviously looking at this we're looking at the 16th century but the most interesting objects what I mentioned earlier is just over here just crammed into an archway there now at his foot that's Eva a sheep or it's a line of Judah which would have indicated that he may have served in the Crusades but there's no monument to this particular man but even so you can see that the feet across which is a typical sign of perhaps being a knight or Knight Templar so there's certainly a very good history here I'm actually now picking up first the first time since I've been here today I'm actually picking up on something you are who I think who is buried here who is or was in service either to the the night that I pointed out to earlier to militants who were buried over there I just feel that his presence is here to sustain their presence ease within the church it's almost though this man is still in service to the family and he is interred outside of this building in the graveyard but I feel his presence here and I see him more or less dressed he's quite rotund probably no more than 50 but quite old and wearing like a medieval smoke atop so I get the feeling on connection more like the servant of the knight who is interred here is I've never felt that before on an investigation I've been to many many churches but never actually thinking that one a servant who stood attached to to somebody was actually so that's quite an interesting first so whatever wandered down and see what was in time for sure definitely over here is a very strong energy over in Middleton great here the monument energy changes here here the energy feels much more recently now I'm feeling a thing sickness and fitting presence of a woman whose name is Jemima and surname is something like baby a wife something similar to that maybe day it just feels tremendous sickness I'm not sure whether this lady died here or whether some terrible event won't act happened here 17th century is the period that I'm picking up for this particular person a tremendous just a sickness and sadness but nothing more it's really strange spirit many who are still here in spirit that's strange can't see what's actually lonely it's a plate at the very spot where I'm sitting this energy okay that of the churchwarden mm-hmm now what I'm actually thinking out here I wasn't to say a very protective energy of somebody and this is perhaps more recent probably about 60 or 70 years ago quite a slim man quite elderly with mustache very neatly trimmed almost military wearing a checkered suit plain shirts and brown tie and it's almost as though he is still here part of the congregation part of the church looking after this building although this building is it were should we say has been abandoned by those of the living clothes in spirit are still very much connected to this beautiful building and that is evidenced by the amount of energy that I'm now feeling as I'm walking around what are we going to do is just follow all the way around to the other side and then we're going to have sit down and see if we can pick up anything or any EVP perhaps here very strong very strong energy presence might almost have a spike here I'm feeling quite well I headed but that only headedness I can't actually associate to a particular person this almost like a well of energy here it's almost like a core energy area which I would say is the center of the spiritual center of this church it's very very strong here just briefly literally professional certainty I saw a men in dark clothing that's all I can describe I just saw this dark figure which was sat here and he was bent over slightly as though he was at prayer or in quiet contemplation and just for a second he remained invisible to me and then quickly disappeared and he's personally mr. Thomas that's the problem with energy and a problem with what I actually do is that sometimes when you wander into a building they jump at you telling you much more about who they are on their lives and sometimes you pick up absolutely nothing or on this occasion you just have little flashbacks to particular persons or individuals but a collective energy in this church is very very powerful I can imagine that this building at night would be very active and it's such a quiet and tranquil building considering or only a few miles from Stansted Airport which is which is very very strange once you're up here mmm-hmm pretty that's the story this is all car I think it's cardboard as its tone okay where is actual stone this is an absolutely exquisite piece of artwork it's beautifully carved and there's a history to Salisbury and she died in 1614 there's a funny smell here up and smell fish we hadn't lived yeah there you pick up but I'm not actually feeling anything from her at all and of course she would be very somewhere in the floor mm-hmm and there's also black up here mm-hmm to a Julia Sarah Hayfield I can hear talking the the core area as I said was down at the bottom so I want to go back down really serious any persons of this church we come in what fine piece will be no armor offense we just wish to make friendly a peaceful contact if there's anything that anybody would like to say that you say so now please as we sit in quiet contemplation and admiration of this beautiful building please could you give me a sign of your presence there's somebody here with us man measuring around it please give us a mutation in your present article article sling article you tell me you're sending a face sorry my old dog Donaldson where's your connection here please and the impression is this person a parishioner who wants to know what we here what we're doing a kind of spiritual curiosity I definitely heard noises like a chair no I think it's but I just see the flash across there you know where that's common to chair is just so way before like done across the back of it the same frame can you come closer please now now standing while I fly out actually it's a woman this lady yeah you can take that yeah yeah it was very very faint and they just moved from the chair across the faculty there so those of you watching there is a display of the flowers near what looks to be a Dutch carved chair of the 17th century and I saw a very great shadow of mist to move across the back very things across the back of the chair and then onto the flower display and Mary's also you picked it up from the clown Sydney yeah so that was definitely yeah so we're being watched and I have suddenly filled with lips there is she was saying certain curiosity for us being here Mary and I then went to the flower display where we earlier saw the mist yeah and it went down it went down those leaves and if you go to that chair that's where I actually saw when this first appear actually went across that the back of the route that chair yeah just know it just melted away and it was just my curiosity and I felt that it was there for a couple of well a few seconds before it decided to disappear it's so strange isn't it it is very dark we've actually got a light on at the moment to to make sure that we get as much detail as we can [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
