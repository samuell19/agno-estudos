So much money? Hail God once! Are you shocked? l too got shocked just like you. As soon as ACP came here, his house was burgled. l was shocked hearing it. When l came to know uniform stars were also missing with money, l was more shocked, knowing many police officers had lost their stars along with money, l was extremely shocked, there's not a black mark on me or my service record, to make Commissioner is a corrupt officer, l acted as if l'm taking bribes, do you know why? l knew you'd come for my money and my stars, and you did, now l got you, bloody rogues. - l found these in the bag. You stole from the homes of corrupt police officers, why did you steal the stars also? l'm asking you. Those officers are not qualified to wear it on uniforms, they shouldn't use it, that's why l stole them. You're a thief, are you questioning about honesty and qualification of police? keep quiet sir, ever since l was a little boy supplying tea to police, till today, l've seen many officers who'll do anything for bribe, sir. l've seen from constable to highest officer. Whom did you see man? You've seen policemen who made money dishonestly, did you see police officers who gave their lives for the people? You haven't seen ! Have you seen police who help your mothers & your children to cross the road? You haven't seen ! Have you seen police officers getting killed in communal clashes? You haven't seen ! Have you seen police officers protecting politicians elected by you? You haven't seen ! Have you seen police officers taking care of unidentified dead bodies? You haven't seen ! Why should l tell about the greatness of my dept. to them? Arrest and send them to remand. lf anyone comes out on bail before a year, kill him in encounter. Move...move... He has a girl friend in our dept. sir. Transfer her to a place where she can't get drinking water also. Bloddy system. Bloddy system is going to dogs. I hate it. This is Commissioner's case, difficult to get bail.- Right. That's why they said not to get drunk and go to wife or steal. Did you listen to it? You said Brandy and we're in jail now.- Wait. No police man complained against us, this made Commissioner furious, So what? He's inquiring all the officers we had robbed, who they are and how much bribes they'd taken, he's inquiring everything. - So what? Looks like Commissioner is opening a can of worms. Catch it. What's this incense smell inside? lt's irritating. Swami, l'll also come with you. - No girl. Jail has no place for chaste women. - Recently on TV... ls it he who was getting served by women on bed?

Factionists must be like them! Though he's old, look at his powerful eyes! Look at his moustache, great! Let our man stand behind every man in the court. lf you suspect anyone... There's someone next to the old man. So much security for one man ! Who is he? Ranga, letis go. Wait! - Let's go, come. Let me see his face. Come, let's go. - What a scene! Just like in films!

Come...come... lsn't he the old man we saw in court? That's him. Which place is this? Rathaiah, get him ready. Bhavani prasad is our God! lf anything happens to him Rayalaseema will burn. Brother Bhavani prasad! Come out! Brother Bhavani prasad! Come out! Brother Bhavani prasad! Come out! lf anything happens to brother Rayalaseema will burn. l'm fine, will be fine till l've your blessings. Nothing will happen to me. Go! Which place is this? Why such a big crowd has gathered? Why are they carrying guns? Why are they shouting Bhavani prasad? Who is this Bhavani prasad? Who is Bhavani prasad? Old lady! Hey oldie! What are you doing here? Why did you come here? Which place is this? Who are these people? Who is he? He's just like me. Tell me, why did you come here? Ranga, this is your native place. This is your family! You're his blood relative, All these people are your relatives. A region in Rayalaseema where people lived for generations, pulicherla, once upon a time, a clan of beasts came into existence. Boss, people are ready to work as coolies but not to kill for us. What shall l do? God creates men, but men have to satiate his own hunger, God will not satiate it, first create hunger, l'll create soldiers from those hungry men. Go! Using hunger as a weapon, feeding them with one hand, gave a weapon with another hand to create an army. They must fear us and it must be in the rice we supply. They must have respect on us from the porridge we supply them, the chilly they eat with porridge must have the devotion for us, making an army out of people and turning sons into commanders, Rudraraju terrorised the region till he was alive, his elder son Nagaraju was like father like son, unable to see pulicherla living as bonded labour to that clan, first time a clan took weapon to save the people of that region, that is Simhapuri clan, Durga prasad is one of them, the fight which started with him took an unexpected turn with his death, Manohar prasad who lived in abroad came to lndia on his father's death. He started the war again as his own which stopped with his father's death. Madam, they've thrown bombs on boss. Either change men or change the bombs. Bloody! What son? Father, this is Rayalaseema moustache, it must be up always. Okay son. Will you fire the gun? - l will father. What's this? Will you make a kid fire gun? lf you had fired, will you let him also fire it? Tradition ! lt's tradition here to hold gun before pen. l don't want my son to grow in such traditions. He has to grow like this. After my father, l took over, he'll take over after me, we'll grow up like this only, you loved and married me, don't push me. Go in. Not in, l'll go to my parents away from such beasts.- Go away. l'm going. Bhavani, come. - No, l'll not come. l'll stay here only. He will not come, he'll stay here only. He'll grow like me, raise our forthcoming child as you wish. Go! Nagaraju, who was waiting for opportunity, didn't spare anyone in the Simhapuri clan, even Manohar prasad's wife too! Come, don't fear...come. Madam...slowly... Come...come... Madam... Raise him humanely. - As you say madam. Losing his wife, Manohar prasad became an unchallenged politician in 20 years, he dedicated his life to people and their welfare, pulicherla faction sent hired goons to kill Manohar prasad in public, His elder son Bhavani prasad, as an answer to every drop of blood from his father's body, cutting every hand in Rayalaseema which held a sickle, created a new tradition for factionism, Came like a lion to change our lives... watch the people behind him like an army hailing him... He came like a sword to save the poor... Fearlessly he mowed down enemies... When he walks the directions too shiver in fear and respect... He's fiery burning Sun... Boiling blood has become his weapon... He's death for the wrong doers... He killed the bad to save the good... He walked like a fearless lion, shattering earth and leaping into sky... lt's usual fight between weapon and muscle.. There's no difference here between killing goats and men... He took to weapons to save near ones... He's matchless in killing the demons... He's army to few but death to many... Became support to the poor and a challenge to death... So many people can't go in. lt seems you called me. Stop it sir, stop this blood flow sir. - What's this? We've orders from top to arrest anyone indulging in violence and not let them out on bail for a year, the list has their names as well as your names too. So what do you want me to do? CM's instruction to settle a compromise between you both. Did you talk to them? They're in the next room, can l ask them to come? Call them. Greetings SP! Bloody little boy! With who else should l compromise, SP? Sub jail, Ananthapur dist. Long live Bhavani prasad! Are you fine, son? lt's been many days since l saw you. Come, let's go inside. He'll be here for a year, nobody must go near the place he is, be careful. One year later... Why are you indifferent? You're different even since returning from jail. What happened? l saw the real Rayalaseema in jail. Who are they? - people of pulicherla. They're sharing their agonies, their difficulties. Whose son is he? - My son. l'm in jail for 5 years, how could you've a son? Giving a bag of rice every month, forcing me to sleep with them, men who are raping me, your boss' sons! They are his fathers! Got it? Mother! ls your daughter-in-law telling the truth? Yes son. lf your mother had been young, those bastards would've raped her too. To protect them and for their sake you killed and went to jail. Are you human? They're all our men ! Not only they, my three sons are also here only. Get up! - Brother. Their sons too are here only. l mean my grandsons. Get up! Brother! 3 generations together we killed 20 people for you. We'll do anything for the Simhapuri lion. What do you say? - We'll give life for you. Who are they? - Our men only! They lost limbs unable to throw bombs properly. Simhapuri philosophy is our philosophy. Kill or get killed! Kill on road or get killed on road. But we don't want a life where we've to die on bed. For us creator is not God but one who feeds us. Do you know who is that? lt's you Bhavani. You're our God! l've understood now we've turned our men into beasts for personal revenge. What have we done? To end factionism here, my policy is to cut any hand that picks up a weapon. l've realized it. people here are picking up weapons for leaders like us, the same people when they hold ploughs, Rayalaseema will change. you mean? Rayalaseema where blood flowed like rivers, water must flow here, hands which carried guns must carry sickles, hands that cut throats must carry ploughs, hands that threw bombs must sow seeds. Seema must take to agriculture. l'll make them do it. Brother, Collector is here. - Greetings Bhavani prasad. Why did you call me at night? What's this sir? Looks like a project plan. This is Simhapuri, this is pulicherla, all these are barren lands, Chithravathi river first tributary, second tributary, if we build an irrigation canal between these two tributaries, what would happen? - Water will flow into the canal, Rayalaseema will turn into granary, can harvest two crops in a year. l too want that to happen. lf you give me this plan, l'll get approval, money... No need! l'll bear the project cost for the people of Rayalaseema. What about the permission? l'll get approvals directly from Central Govt. lf you can do it all by yourself, why did you call me then? Go to pulicherla and tell them it's my word, not to stop my work which l'm doing for the benefit of people. lf it's done, what will happen to people, Minister? people who are dependent on us would become farmers of their own land. What should we do to stop that canal work? Bhavani got the sanction from Central govt. using peoples support. l can't stop the project. How many cases are pending on Bhavani? -18 murder cases. Get all the cases transferred to Hyderbad. Bhavani, all our cases have been transferred to this court. l've arranged security inside. ls it true, granny? For the promise given to your mother, though you'd so many people, l had to take you away and raise alone. What do you want me to do now? lf people who love Bhavani come to know he's dead, entire Rayalaseema will burn with revenge, to keep his aim not getting burnt in that fire, you must become Bhavani prasad to the people of Seema, No, l'll not agree. l'll not let you get my son into this mess.- Why? l promised his mother to raise him away from these family feuds. Mother means? - Daughter-in-law of this family. As daughter-in-law of the same family, l'm telling you the ambition of this family is greater than your promise. Don't stop him. - lmpossible. l'm happy if he's a thief but will not let him become a factionist. Hyderabad? ln a case related to the burgling of Commissioner's house, local thieves Ranga, purse Ram, DD, Godrej Raju, Bike Bachi, were caught red handed by Commissioner, as they were being shifted to court for remand, members of his gang attacked with bombs in court to release them free, Ranga, purse Ram and DD, -3 thieves have managed to escape, City Commissioner has ordered shoot at sight orders on them. Have you understood now? We can do anything. Take him away. - Come. No...no...please tell them... they're taking my son.. please tell them to stop, l beg you. Don't stop me, l'll kill you ! lf anything happens to me before my ambition is achieved, you will achieve it, promise me to do it. l will do it. l will achieve your ambition. l wanted a man but you gave birth to a eunuch. Bhavani prasad is dead, father. He died when l threw bomb at him and l saw him die. Go...and see in Simhapuri. Bhavani isn't dead. Not a scratch on his body. Bloody creep! l had killed myself many demi Gods created in Rayalaseema. l'll kill this demi God Bhavani prasad. Buddy, l didn't know you'd such a big flashback.- Me too. l too didn't know. - Yes. So many guns. Buddy, this is original gun. Don't make sound, l'll cut your neck. My grandfather took the first weapon and made the first bomb here. What the hell you can do with it? Though l wouldn't come or can't come. Same blood and same pride. - Are you planning to settle here? Any doubt? Do you want me to get killed by police bullets? This is my home, l'll stay here only. They didn't spare Bhavani himself, we are noting to them. No, let's go back to our colony. - Let's go back, buddy. Till now did anyone greet or say good morning to us? We're thieves, why would anyone greet us? Other than sending us to jail. Till yesterday we were thieves, from now onwards... what a nasty life! lt wasn't a life at all. Life is here! With Simha dress and twirling moustache like lndra, now l'll show them the real faction acting, who is there? Get them also faction dresses. How can moustache go up in 10 minutes. Get ready quickly, it's Bhavani's birthday. We've to go to the temple. ls the dress too tight? Little tight. - How is my dress? Where's your moustache? Keep it. Moustache? No way. Even ants have moustaches in Seema. SPort it. Father, careful with my suitcase. - Okay. Keep it here. Why didn't you tell me Simhapuri will be so hot? ls it hot? Why not stay pleasantly in women police station's AC rooms, for bringing me here for loving some thief known as Ranga, you can't avoid this hot Sun and l can't avoid this heat. Don't irritate me, father. You've become just like my grandma Mangamma. Sit down. l'll take if you say something on me but not a word on Ranga. Do you know anything about Ranga? Father! Ranga! - Ranga here?! Stop...stop...move away! - lt's me Sl Mangamma! His name is Bhavani prasad, come. Where are you going? - Father, its Ranga. Thief? - Yes. Madam, he's Bhavani prasad. - Bhavani prasad? He's the biggest factionist leader in Rayalaseema. See the files in station, there are 18 murder cases on him. Lift the window pane. This is unjust, brother. l'm here to get you out of trouble, how can you trouble me, brother? lf l say it may look by the way, who am l? Thief, who is Manga? police, can thief and police ever be lovers? But we are! God has united and sent us to Rayalaseema too. Who is she between us? - He's Bhavani prasad, come. Lift the window. - What's this? l'm telling you, l love Manga. l'll marry Manga, l'll have children with Manga. Bye! Heart...heart...don't rush... Don't dream too much and lament, O youth... He comes like uninvited guest... He brings to life my enchanting dreams... He comes near romantically and caresses my body... With his hot wet breath he tickles me and pinches my cheeks... He takes me into his arms with love and passion... He walks along with me, he follows me like shadow... He'll become a part of you and become your man... Let this excitement cool down little... lf he becomes all of you, where is the place for you? Don't hold back yourself, give yourself in... Enough of worry, no more dreams... Don't go anywhere, don't torture me, it's not fair... Don't ignite passions in me... Won't it take it's toll on me if risen? Always think of him and get mesmerized... He fills my thoughts, my life and my dreams... Wherever l may be, he comes like a boon... Don't raise the speed...don't push me... l must hide my thoughts... must be in limits, won't you listen? Before l take off my married woman's symbols, l want to the bloodshed to happen. Arrange it. Leave me! Leave me! He's the man who threw the first bomb on your brother. put the glasses. - Why? lf not the fear in your heart will be seen in your eyes. Buddy, he may kill him. - Bloody old man ! Rathaiah ! One shot only! l'll not tell. Write FlR that he got crushed under your jeep. Where is my son's head? When a soldier died for the country, only mother cries for him not the country. You must cry but not for losing your only soldier like son, you must cry for giving -100 of such sons to me. Cry...cry! Cry! One shot only! She said one shot and he killed him in one shot, and l wetted my pant in one shot. - Buddy, l can foresee our future. They'll give us a job, and we'll refuse to do that's all, one shot only! l'm wetting my pant and shirt just thinking of it. What shall we do now, Ranga? After you both change the pants, all three of us... Before police kill us in Hyderabad, we must kill a man, Who? - Jayaprakash Reddy! What did he do? - He turned us into film buffs. Now we came to know the difference between films and real factions. Right. Got back our senses. How they cheated and betrayed us? Let's take him to task. Why are you still sporting moustache? - Remove it. You wipe it. Come. Will you go away? Go. - Can l go? Nobody can stop a man who wants to die.- You mean? pulicherla people are waiting to cut you to pieces. Dogs are also ready to take those pieces. Have you forgotten that ants too have moustaches in Seema? SPort it! Go. - l will. You're talking nonsense. Yes sir. He's Ranga the thief of Hyderabad, there are 78 theft cases on him, if you've doubt get his files and check. I know what to do. Shut up and get out. Greetings madam. What did the SP say? - What would he say? l say he's Ranga, he says he's Bhavani prasad. lf l insist, he warns to get me transferred. What a great news! Let's forget about these Ranga and Bhavani, and go back to Amalapuram and live happily there. No father, a police officer in uniform, and a girl who loves a man, don't spare any matter so easily. Let your attitude go to hell! father, to know if he's Ranga or Bhavani, l must go to that house. l'm going. Don't go Manga. Bhavani Prasad, Rataiya, Satta Reddy, Salim. All your gun licenses will expire today, SP has sent forms to renew the licenses. My husband doesn't need a gun license. What's this madam? -78 cases, 12 police stations, got used to signing my name as Ranga. Sorry l told you about a girl, it's her. l need to talk to you. This matter must remain secret between us only. You stay in this house as my younger sister. lt's been many days since we had drinks. Sister-in-law has united Ranga and Manga. What about the old friends then? - Old friends? Vanajakshi? - She's very short. Jalajakshi? - She's very thin. Kamakshi? - She's very fat. Meenakshi? - Super! How Ranga and Meenakshi enjoyed each other's company! lt's sensational...my heart says this Meenakshi ...You're great... lf you drape yourself in thin transparent sari, Meenakshi... Won't the world go crazy? lf you wear sexy jacket, Meenakshi... Won't there be chaos on roads? His name is Ranga but infant for milk of love... lf he sees fishes, he becomes a thief... Don't look out for April and March... Relieve me of this pleasant pain with your beauty and youth... Shining Meenakshi... magical eyed Meenakshi... Your plait is like black cobra... My heart skips a beat on seeing it... There's a violin in my hips... lt's devastating if you play music on it... Hey Manga, your kiss is bliss to me... lf l come to steal you like a thief, it's sensational... You've lit fires of passion in heart... Will you make me leave my shyness and shame to the wind? l think you eat hot and spicy food... You've taken over trapping me with your beauty...- ls it? Meenakshi, fish eyed beauty...

And look at you shell shocked... One shot only! How dare you enter Simhapuri! How dare! Turn the bloody rascals! - Remove their masks. You...? Brother...brother... How could you do after being loyal to this family so many years? What would be the reaction of your wife and children if they know? l made a mistake. - We know sir. l sent him. Why did you come here? - Why did you do this? Hunger...hunger sir. Don't we give you money every month? The money and rice you give isn't enough for me and my husband, now we've a child, no milk in my breasts, how am l to feed this child? pulicherla people promised to pay Rs.5 lakhs to kill him. We thought of raising our child far away from here. For his mistake, please kill us also with him. As you said we thought of taking up agriculture, we mortgaged our lands for bank loans, after completing all formalities, Nagaraja got the bank manager to marry his daughter, Well done son-in-law! Without water we lost crops, how long should we live these rotten lives. Kill us...kill us... Come tomorrow morning and take your documents. Tomorrow! Robbing again ! l'm scared for the first time. people have security for lives in Rayalaseema, but not for purses and bureaus. Come. Give me the acid. - Take it. Hold it. Documents are here only. - All the documents. How many banks should we go to with these papers? Recognised him? Bank manager. lf loans don't get sanctioned in 2 days, l'll cut you to pieces and bury you in the same sack. Sanction their loan first. Greetings sir! As you ordered Manager has sanctioned loans to all of them. Thanks for accepting my request and sanctioning agriculture loans. Will your aim get fulfilled by forcing me to give loans? Do you think loans will give them bumper crops? You know about my father-in-law, right? You can't get even 10 drops of water to this region in centuries. Dead! How many people will you kill? The anger which you didn't get on killing your own brother, is it coming out now for killing an enemy? Leave him...leave him. Do you know what is this? Auspicious thread! A woman will carry it with pride till her husband is alive, do you know how the same thing will become a burden after his death? l'm carrying the burden and aim of this family. lf you can, help me, if you can't, make habit to see death. Throw his body near pulicherla boundary. l got you again, Bhavani prasad! What happened, buddy? - pulicherla people killed me. You? You're fine, right? What's that look? What a thing that priest had done to us! The faction which is making you go overboard, my you get trapped in the same factionism. The priest spilled water then, but we feel it now. Before pulicherla people lynch us like cats, find a way to escape from here like ants. Why did you bring us here? To show you tiger. - Bloody! Send them in. Sit down. First time Simhapuri people have entered pulicherla. For friendship or enmity? As you think we didn't kill your son-in-law or your men. Actually l'm not Bhavani prasad at all. l know it Ranga. - Know? Do you know l'm Ranga and not Bhavani prasad? SP read your files and told me everything. Didn't l tell you? You got worried unnecessarily. Look elderly man, they wetted their pants on hearing your name. You won't harm us, right? He won't harm us, he knows l'm Ranga. How can he harm? What can he do? - l'm not Bhavani prasad.- Yes. We both know Bhavani was killed in a bomb attack in court. But people who revere him as God don't know this. lf they shouldn't hear Bhavani's name, he must die again. Stop joking, how can you kill a dead man? l can. - Who? You ! - Me? l'll make you come behind from your sister-in-law, turn you into Bhavani and then kill you. We are thieves not killers. lsn't it? l'll force you to pick weapon and then kill you as Bhavani. Then only l'll kill you. Rayalaseema where blood flowed, water should flow there now. Hands that held guns must hold sickles, hands that cut throats must hold ploughs, hands that threw bombs must sow seeds, this region must take to agriculture. project will be completed in a week, l don't want pulicherla people to stop it at any cost. Guard and secure the place. Go! Sir, irrigation project by Simhapuri will be completed in a week, moreover Governor is coming to inaugurate it. Governors will come and go, governments will come and go, but factionism is the only that survives in this region. Before he cools down this factionism with water, show the taste of factionism for the last time to people of Simhapuri. Why don't they cry here? Every woman here would've lost someone in family to faction fight, not only to drink water, there are no tears too, that's because of pulicherla people. Get Rathaiah, who is protecting Simhapuri clan for 2 generations. See in which vehicle Rathaiah is there! Got him! Uncle, we've brought Rathaiah ! Though grown old, you're still a real man ! Don't come near me for 10 minutes after cutting my neck. Even if l've the last breath, l'll kill at least 10 people. Bloody creep! kill me...kill me... You killed my son in one shot, right? - Yes, l killed him. can we trust Ranga? He too has the same blood line. The day his blood boils, you can see yourself what he can do. How did you raise him? Madam... Didn't you add salt to the porridge? Didn't add chilly in the food? When this family is getting crushed, as daughter-in-law to family, my blood is boiling with anger, as heir of this family carrying the same bloodline, why is so cowardly? Why? His grandfather, father and brother had died for a great cause, why is he still silent? What are you saying? About whom you're talking? l came to know that l've a family after you told me, l may carry their bloodline, but l don't have anyone, l don't know, l didn't see. Don't you've any relationship with them? Aren't they your men? - There are...they are elsewhere, this old lady who saved every grain to raise me, she's mine, this old lady is mother, father, sister and brother. When l cried for milk, instead of feeding their children, they fed me, mothers of my colony, they're my people, though beaten up by police, they saved me by not telling my name, thieves of that colony, they're my people, the girl who gave up police job, and living among demons like you in fear, she's mine, have you understood who my people are? This is your clan ! - This is not my clan ! l'm telling you now, let them dare to touch anyone whom l said are my people, then l'll show them who Ranga is! Come oldie! Come. Oldie! Oldie! Granny! What were the names of my parents? l'll make you pick up weapon, turn you Bhavani and then kill you. Then only l'll kill you. l'll not spare anyone. Kill you ! The last lion has come with sword from Simhapuri. Go and hunt him! Kill them quickly! l'm not a lion sleeping in forest, for you to hunt, l'm a ferocious lion which hunts the hunters. Lion of Simhapuri ... Come, bloody bastard! This is my house! This is my clan ! This is my native place Simhapuri! See! Why are you seeing me instead of the house? Sister-in-law! Why is he saying sister-in-law? - Sister-in-law! l've brought the factionist like a dog here. Come out and see! Yes, l'm not Bhavani prasad as you think, l'm your God Bhavani's own brother. My name is Ranga. 3 months ago he killed my brother Bhavani, to achieve his aim, my sister-in-law made me Bhavani. Sister-in-law! Did you see what happened to pulicherla if l take weapon? Factionism isn't just gun, swords and Sumos. Factionism means courage, you must have it here. Give me a sword! - Kill him! You swore to turn me into Bhavani and then kill me before my people, l'm giving you an opportunity, if you've guts, kill me. Come! pick it up! pick up! How many people did he kill in your family? He killed al my three sons, sir. What are you still waiting for then? Go! Bloody bastard! pick the sword now! l've seen many like you in Hyderabad. pick up the sword. Sister-in-law! A cat in the pulicherla tiger clan. Brother! Killed him! No more enemies to create hurdles in achieving your aim. l'll fulfill your aim. l'll keep the promise you made to the people of Rayalaseema. l've kept the promise given to you. Your aim has been achieved. This film is dedicated to two great leader who strived hard for the progress of Rayalaseema, Late Dr. NT Rama Rao,
