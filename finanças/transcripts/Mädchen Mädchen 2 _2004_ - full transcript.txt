- Here, three rooms. - 1000 euros. - And this one? - Too expensive. We'll never find an apartment. My father's girlfriend moved into my room. She runs rebirthing seminars there. I thought it'd be better if Lukas, my boyfriend... If Lukas and I... If we lived apart for a while. For my mother, my living at home... was a kind of an "image problem"... And then I moved out. I'm moving in with my two best friends. We're all non-smokers and very quiet. So what do you have in three-room apartments... at 500 euros? Period building? Parquet? Stucco? Period buildings are nice. Parquet is better than carpets. Stucco is great, of course. So what have you got? Nothing. - Here. - Thanks. How long before we're allotted an apartment? At the moment you have to wait 2 or 3 years. Well, my girlfriends and I... want an apartment right now. Preferably tomorrow. To cut a long story short, we want an apartment with 3 rooms. If you have 2,000 of them, then... nobody would notice... if one of them was a bit cheaper. I don't own the apartments. My boss does. Sure, sure. Okay, then... - You study psychology, right? - Yes. His son is studying the same thing. Maybe you could ask him. Really? GIRLS ON TOP 2 - Loft over Love "The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain." Logopedics, I study speech therapy. You can't sit here without a drink. I'd like a glass of tap water. - Half a litre would be great. - Coming up. His name is Sebastian Bernstein. Yeah? Now I just have to meet him. - And he'll give us an apartment. - Sure! And then he'll marry me, as well. Free fitness-training session? - Great! - It's yours if you separate this. - Free fitness training? - No, thanks. - Yes. - I mean yes. =Hello. - Thanks. -Welcome - Well? - All too expensive. I've found a way, but it may take a while. But the son of the guy with the 2,000 apartments studies with me... Hello? Yes, she's here. One moment. Lukas. Is something wrong? Okay, I'll come by later. I think I've got 100 euros in the bank. Okay, see you later. Bye. He needs money again? Right. Sure. Did you manage it? Super! And you? Great. This is for you. - Thanks. - Thanks. Thanks! And 800 students live here, really? But not all on the sixth floor. We can put all the boxes on the bed and the mattress on the floor. Otherwise I can't get at the closet. Yeah, okay. Is it really okay if we stay a couple nights? Yeah, sure. I mean, if you've got nowhere else. - 'ello, Flin. - Hello. - Can you 'elp me with my computer? - Sure! This is Beatrice. We share a bathroom. Beatrice, this is Inken and Lucy. - 'Ello! - Hello. The "h" is formed in the glottis. If you French people have such a thing. Pardonee? Par..don! There's no "e" sound. Pardonee! Okay,.. ..Bitch. Don't mention it. Look at this messy house! You said you'd clean up. -For the thousandth time! -Oh! I don't believe this. Every time I come home this place looks like shit. - Hi. - Hi. Now I've got nothing left in the bank. I'm off to university. - I've got my first patient today. - Really? I remember recording my first song in the studio. The first time is always something special, you know? - Will you clean up? - Sure. I did it the last 80 times. Yes! We're riding at a fast, even pace on a flat road. The sun is shining, the wind is blowing through our hair. Excuse me. 'Ello. Hello! Okay, now uphill! If you can't make it, change gears. - Everything 'unky dory? - Yes, everything's hunky dory. And go! Damn, shit, crap! 'Arry 'ad a 'at on 'is 'ead. That's five "hs". No! I can't eat so many sweets! Again. 'Arry 'ad a 'at on 'is 'ead. Another 50 metres. Home stretch! Sprint! And stop! You're not allowed to bring your own drinks. Hey. Hello. - Just a little prick. - I don't take injections. Sorry, but you need an anaesthetic. But I don't take injections. - How old are you anyway? - 21. You're 17 at the most. I want a real doctor! Hello, I'm Johann... ..Röderer. I look after new students. Hello. Lena. He thinks I'm only 17... and won't let me treat or anesthetize him. Hello, I'm Dr. Röderer. If you prefer it, we can work without an anesthetic. Lena, suction, please. Open wide. - Which one is it? - The 2/6. Anesthetic? Are you coming to the dentistry party? Me? Yeah... Where's it at? Here. Not strictly legal. Only for insiders. You coming? We met at the university when my wife... was treating her first patient. From now on we'll treat all our patients together. - Are you coming? - Yeah, maybe I will. Fine. Looking forward to it. Where's the cup? Shit! Damn! - I'm really sorry! - Not a big deal. - You ran into me too! - What? It's not my fault. Don't think I'm buying you a new shirt. Don't worry about it. And you don't have to buy me a coffee. Oh, thanks, that's nice of you. Could you lend me one euro? - Here. - Cool. Thanks. - What semester are you in? - The eighth. Really? Do you know Sebastian Bernstein? Why? - Do you need an apartment? - Yes. Everyone comes onto him when they want to get an apartment. - So do you know him or not? - No, I don't know him. Pity. - What semester are you in? - Fourth. Do you know anyone who might know him? Nope. Do you want to get a coffee? I've already got a coffee. Thanks anyway! Okay, I was lying. I do know him. - We're going to the cinema this evening. - Really? Want to come? - Okay, I'll give you my number. - Okay. Hold this a sec. Fine. Then we'll call about this evening. - Yes, fine. - Fine. - See you then. - See you then. 2,000 apartments. Take your pick! I can't possibly accept. Or can I? I'm so sorry! My lens! My contact lens! My contact lens must be here somewhere. Don't move! My contact lens! Hey. Hello? Yes, I was at your office this morning. No! Where? 480 euros? That's great! Yes, we'll be right over. I'll call my girlfriends. Thanks! SPEAK NOW - Lucy. - Floozy. - Lucy. - Rudi. Hey Lucy, it's me! You won't believe it. The real estate agent has a bargain for us. Yeah, we can view it right now. First I have to go home for my glasses. Bye. Be very calm. Labour has begun... But we are still inside the womb. Excuse me. I need my old glasses. Mr. Schwiekowsli, that's going to be a breech birth! You've got your arse facing the wrong way. Turn, turn... - Sorry. - Just leave it there. I need my old glasses. I can't see a thing. Keep breathing. Just keep breathing. Let's look forward to the birth canal. You selfish little freak! Inken, hello. I'm off again, just getting my glasses. - I lost one of my lenses. - The glasses look really nice. Papa, I picked them out when I was 12... and even then they were childish. Can't you give me a little money? I can't run around looking like this. Of course. - But don't tell Christine. - You're a pet. Oh. - How's the apartment-hunting going? - I have to go look at a place. A bargain. I better hurry. The cellar is dried out and we're putting in a lift here. - Is that a guarantee? - Of course. I'll be right with you. - Hello. - Hello. Are you also looking at this place? - Sure, at that price! - It's not all that cheap. Well, you won't get anything cheaper in Munich. Oh, really? I mean, with this kitchen, all this space. It's incredible for that price. Yeah, sure. - May I ask you what you do for a living? - Me? I'm a logopedics student. - And your husband? - I haven't got one. - You have rich parents, then? - No, my father's a teacher... and his girlfriend runs rebirth courses. Did you have a difficult birth? Not really. I came into the world in one hour. No! Me too! Inken? There you are! - Our apartment is next door. - Oh, right. Is it as nice as this one? Not Really. Maybe we'll be neighbors soon. - You okay? - It's nothing! Come on. The apartment is free for 3 months. After that the lift will be installed. We usually don't rent places like this. It's a real bargain. And as you seemed in such a rush I decided to do you a favor. Okay! A walk-in closet. - Now that's something. - Let's see. That's the third room. Three rooms for 480 euros. This apartment is amazing. You know what amazes me? I quite like it, actually. I think we should take it. Good. Then you can sign the lease tomorrow. I've got business next door. I've never seen such an ugly apartment. After we've talked about my commission... there should be no problem. - And your bike? - I'll pick it up later. He's so sweet! He lives next door. A Porsche driver? Well, I like Porsches. I couldn't get my bed into that room. After I meet Bernstein tonight... we'll get a palace, for free! Why are you being so rotten? I don't go running after guys just because they've got money. So you'd rather live in a closet? - Lucy, Lena! - You idiot! At least I have sex. When did you last sleep with Lukas? - None of your business. - Must be a while ago. Super. I haven't had sex for 6 months. You know nothing about love. - Lena! - It's true! I think you've turned into Luka's mother, that's why there's no sex. Because you don't fuck your mother. No way I'm moving in with you. Lena! - But it's true! - Well, fuck both of you! Are you coming or going? Hey, you'll be the first to know! Men! I don't know what's keeping him. - I don't think he's coming. - Rubbish. He's probably just parking. Ah, there he is! No, it's not him. Well then. We can leave his ticket at the desk. I'll wait here. Then I'll wait as well. The dentist says to his patient: "You don't have to open that wide." "Why not, Doctor? "Don't you want to drill?" "Yes I do..But I don't want to fall in." - You leaving already? - Me? No. I just got here. Thanks. Would you like a cup of tea? - Yes, please. - Okay, I'll be right back. Isn't Flin here? No. Do you see him here? Can you ask him if he comes to me? I don't know if he comes to you. Tell him I have a little problem. Yes, I imagine you have. It was a nice evening. Thanks for the lift. It was a pleasure. Do you have to buy a lot of instruments next semester? Don't remind me. I've got plenty of things, good as new. Do you want them? You're beautiful. I think I drank a little too much. Shall I go in with you? No thanks, I'll be fine. I'll call you. - What are you doing tomorrow? - Me? Plenty. - And the day after? - Even more. Pity. I wanted you to meet Mr. Bernstein. - Oh, like this evening, right? - I don't know what happened to him. Like I said, he hates women who only want to get an apartment from him. I wouldn't put it to him like that. How then? The way all girls do, with charm. With charm? I haven't seen much evidence of that. Are you trying to analyze me or what? No need. You're too easy to see through. Me? I'm easy to see through? - Yes! - No! You're easy to see through. What kind of game are you playing here? I'll bet that you don't even know Sebastian Bernstein. You've lost the bet. He's one of my best friends. Yeah, sure. And the next time he's your brother? Okay, have a nice evening. - See you around. - I don't think so. -You filmed this? -Uh huh. They're so beautiful. Would you take me with you? Sure. Hey, Inken. Hello, Flin. Am I disturbing you? Not at all. Not in the least. - How are things? - Pretty good. - You want something to drink? - Yeah. Maybe tea. It's over between me and Lukas. - Have you met someone new? - No! Yes, I have. - Hey. Where have you been? - Hey. At the cinema. - How was it? - Pretty good. - Good film? - The film was pretty boring, really. Lena's there too. - Sorry. - No problem. It's so nice of you to let us sleep here. Don't mention it. What's that? That's Beatrice. The one I share the bathroom with. She eats everything in the fridge, then throws it all up again. Huh. Sexy! - Do you fancy her? - Not when she's throwing up. Can't you sleep? So, here it is. Now you only have to pay me... 3 months' rent deposit. - To move in for 3 months? - That's how it is. - But I've got no money. - Me neither. No problem. We'll manage it. Shitty weather! A weiner? Would you like to take part in a little test? Hello! ....Dammit. Thanks for taking the test, Granny. - We couldn't find anybody else. - That's no problem. You look at the two women... and then you write down what they are saying about the product. But there's nothing there! - Yes, you're supposed to fill it in. - But what am I supposed to write? That's the test, Granny! You never said anything about a test. There's nothing in there! The jackpot is an incredible 500 euros! Every time someone in the film says "Majesty"... you drink a shot. If you miss three shots... you're out. Okay? Let's go. First you have to apply for an audience with Her Majesty. Then you have to wait until Her Majesty grants you the audience. Here. Excuse me! One moment... Your Majesty, I humbly beg your pardon... for daring to address Your Majesty. But what happened? Your Majesty, leaving the feast would irreparably damage relations... - A weiner? - Thank you, very tasty. A flyer for you. - Excuse me. - Yes? - How much is this? - I don't think it's for sale. Here you go! - How much is this? - That's not for sale, either. So why are you at the flea market? Inken, you okay? One can tell, Your Majesty. And the Hungarians... who do not know Your Majesty... who have only read about Your Majesty... in the Hungarian newspapers, they worship Your Majesty. More than this: They love Your Majesty. Because they know that Your Majesty is their good angel. Your Majesty! - Did you make any money? - 10 euros. - I put some in myself. - What now? My car? Not a chance! Okay, where's the closest subway? - Weiners! - Wanna try one? Tasty! Sorry, I have to disappear for a sec. - What's up with her? - No idea. Damn! Hello! I knew it was you. What are you doing here? - Just doing some shopping. - Shopping? By the way, you didn't believe me... but that guy over there is Sebastian Bernstein. - What? - The guy with the 2,000 apartments. - Weiner? - No thanks. - That's him? - It's free! Thanks, I don't want a weiner. Exactly. Come on, I'll introduce you. No. - Now? - Yeah, sure. I'd rather not. Lucy, what are you doing? Pack up your weiners! That's it for today. Okay, I'll arrange a date for you two if you like. - Really? - Sure. Weiner? That's right, tomorrow morning at 10. I can't hold it up! Yes. The move is running all by itself. It's going great. Very good. Put your box on here! No, not you. Ms. Meier called twice already. Yes. I'll take care of it personally. Exactly. I'll pick you up from the airport tomorrow. That's great. Okay. No, very good. Hello? Hello? - Everything okay? - I'm fine. Sticky tape. I go for that! We need detergent and toilet paper. I spent my last money on new lenses. - I'm broke too. - Me too. And we've nothing to eat. - We could sell the sanitary napkins. - No, we'll need them. - Hello. - Hello. This is for you. For your new flat. Thanks. - This is Johann Röderer. - Inken. Hello. - I've heard a lot about you. - Thanks. - I'm honored. - Hello. Here, I'll put it in the fridge. Would you like to come sailing tomorrow on Lake Starnberg? Sure... Why not? Cool, I'll pick you up in the morning. Uh huh. I gotta go. Sorry. My research project. - See you tomorrow, then. - Okay. Looking forward to it. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Röderer? He's really called Röderer? As in Röderer champagne? Lena, you know what that means? I don't really know him. I don't think he's that rich. He shits gold coins! He seems very nice. Maybe the Röderer dynasty also owns a few apartments. Maybe. I can ask him. Do that. Things are looking up, girls! And I'll be meeting Mr. Bernstein. And then... Hello, this is the apartment of the future millionaires' wives. Oh, it's you. Have you fixed something up with Sebastian yet? Yeah. What are you doing later? -I thought maybe we could... -Wait a second. Hold onto your hat! Paul from next door is throwing a party... And.. - We're invited! - So we'll go there. Definitely! Hey, our neighbor's throwing a party... - so maybe Sebastian could come. - Okay. So that's next door to the future millionaires' wives' apartment? That's right. Okay, we'll be there. What do you mean "we"? I'm starving. The party doesn't start for half an hour. I'll get it. - Hi. - Hello. I could do with some help. Have you got a minute? Sure. - We can help too! - He asked Inken, not us. Ok, then not. - Did you do all this today? - The catering service. Of course! - Can I take one? - Sure. Well? - Bit salty. - That's Russian caviar. So they can afford caviar now? It looks fantastic. That's... dericious! Excuse me. "Delicious!" Your "L" is a little clumsy. - My "L"? - Don't worry. 68 percent of Germans suffer from so-called "L" impediment. For "L", the tip of the tongue is at the front. Look here! L-aughing, L-eaping, L-oving. That's where the "L" is formed. - Can I feel it again? - Sure. - Here? - Yes. What are they doing? Renovating? Ilse! -Inken! -Inken...Inken - That was quick. - Yeah. Inken hasn't changed her taste in men. - I'm hungry. - Me too. 5,000 euros per square meter. That's a good price. In Munich, remember! I mean... you can't expect to find... So what, are they a couple now? That's a bargain. The real estate agent... I mean, we live next door... Inken seems to think so. Not right next door, but one door down. So it's really the same... - Guests! - Oh, guests! Dirk! Hello! - Daniel! - Hello. Nice of you to come. This is Inken. She lives next door. This is Daniel, my boss. - I'm delighted! - Hello. I'm so pleased to finally meet you! I hope you have a lot of fun. Make yourself at home. Good evening. Allow me to introduce myself: I'm Harald. I live downstairs. Nice to meet you, Gerald. Help yourself. Come on, Daniel, I'll show you the place. - She's cute. - Yeah. It's lovely here. My apartment's exactly the same, only my mother decorated it. - Really? - In beige. But nice. - I'm off to the loo. - Okay. Looking for someone in particular? Paul. He's throwing a party. Fourth floor. My mother always says: "Either you have taste, or you don't." Excuse me. - Hi. - Hello. Flin. What are you doing here? I made you some Chili. You don't have a thing in the house. Cool! Do you want to put it in the kitchen? The door's open. Wanna dance? - Hi Flin, what are you doing here? - I made chili for you. Lovely, thanks. One moment. - Hello? - Hi. Lukas. Hi. Hi. No, you're not interrupting. I've written two songs since you left. Want to hear them? Sure. Okay. I'll put the phone down. I can't hear you now. I don't have a bridge yet. You like it? Or is it too soft? - I think it's lovely. - Thanks. I miss you, Lena. Okay, then... See you soon. Yes? You're the sweetest little thing that I've ever seen... - Johann? - Yes. I'm in the lab. I've done 80 fillings. I've had enough of it. I'm looking forward to the weekend. - Yeah. Me too. - I'll tell you... when you're lying on deck and the sun is shining... it's fantastic. So this evening your friend is... - let me guess... sick? - No. - He's busy. - I get the feeling... that the guy today wasn't Sebastian Bernstein. - What? - He could have been anybody. He looked a bit strange. Oh, right. Rich people all look weird, or what? I bet you don't even know him. His birthday is on May 9th. He fell off a horse when he was 13. His mother was born on the 18th of June and his father is 60 tomorrow. - Where do they live? - The east side of Lake Starnberg. The driveway is partially hidden... by a boat for hire business near Münsing. When is his mother's birthday again? On the 18th of June. - The caviar is a bit cheap. - Oh, the caviar is cheap? Aren't you ashamed of stuffing your face like this? That's what I always do. - Another sip? - No thanks. Hey. I said no. - Very funny! - You want to play charades? -No, I don't think so. - Come on, everyone's playing! Okay. Shall we go get something to eat? Beethoven's Fifth always makes me so... so different. Different in what way? So edgy. Maybe... Maybe you're just edgy because you're sitting beside me. - Why you? - I think you fancy me. You know what you are? A megalomaniac! And you're cold as a fridge. Don't think I'm getting soft. Of course not. Well? Can you hear Beethoven's fifth? - You're not that good a kisser. - No? No. Okay, clock's running. - Okay. - Woman. Espresso. Coffee. - Stewardess. - Snow White. Waitress! Waitress! - Pumuckl! (cartoon) - Blonde. - Astronaut. - Door man. - Sun. - Hairdresser? - Ikea. - Midwife. A porn star! Sleeping Beauty. - Schoolteacher. - Rapunzel. -Sardines. -Dissatisfaction. Telephone sex! - Bondage. - What makes you think that? Why not? - Answering machine. - Time's up. So what was it? The boss's ... secretary. - Bye. - Super evening. Bye. - Gerald. - Great party. - Bye. - Great, really great. I hope to see you at the next party. Thanks. I enjoyed myself. Shall I call you a taxi? That's won't be necessary. I'm Paul's fiancée. Really? How nice. Okay then, have a nice evening. - Bye. - Bye. Hello? Lena? Lucy? Oh Karin! Okay, I'll give you a goodbye kiss. But don't think I'm mad about you. Of course not. Okay. - See you around. - See you. How cool! That's a real gentleman. Oh. How romantic! - Hi. - Bye. -Have fun! - Thanks. - Lena, I envy you! So? In love? Me? Rubbish! You're glowing. Yeah. Last night was fun. - How did you get on? - Super. Really. Great fun. I took off, I didn't want to have to tidy up. - And Paul, was he ok? - Super! His workmates are all super. Everything's super. And the food was so good. - I think I'll go to Flin's. - Flin? - Why Flin? - Because I'd like to see him. You always go to Flin when there's no one else around. No, I go to him all the time. - Really? When? - Now, for example. And what about the apartment? Flin won't get us one! Neither will you! All you do is talk about getting your hands on this Bernstein. That guy is making a fool of you. There probably is no Bernstein. - Of course there is. - And where is he? His father is 60 today and they live on Lake Starnberg. - Maybe I'll drop by there today. - How will you get in? - He doesn't know you. - I'll get in. - Then do it! - Yeah, I will! -Hello. -Hi. - Is Flin there? - I think he's in his room. Thanks. - What are you doing? - What does it look like? - 'Ello! - "H", that's an "h"! Hello! Inken! Okay, I get it. Peace. I'll go in one moment. I just wanted to say sorry for being so mean yesterday. - No problem. Really. - But you can't just smash... pictures as if I mean a lot to you. And I come here to tell you what you mean to me... and I find you lying here underneath this stupid bulimic cow! That is not okay! - Excose me! - "U" not "O"! Excuse me! Say something, Flin. Just this once, I don't have time for you Inken, okay? Okay....Okay. - Hello! - Hey. You were so funny yesterday. Two of my workmates mentioned it. Yeah? Very funny. I had just rang your bell. I wanted to have a champagne breakfast with you. And what about your fiancée? She wants us to get engaged. But she's not even my girlfriend. But it's cute that you're jealous. Me? Jealous? Not! It's just that I have a visitor. He's waiting in my room. I see. See you around, yeah? Sure. Asshole. Ohh! Uhn! Yeah! Yeah! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Oh, God! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Go! Go! Oh! Oh! Oh! Yes! YEAAHHH! Shriek!!! Hello. Excuse me, but do you don't happen to have a piece of packaging string? I'm just wrapping a parcel for my mother. I think so. Just a moment. Sorry, this is all I have. But maybe you could try it with this? If you need any more then just let me know, right? Come on! Run! Well? Unbelievable. It's so lovely here. Yes. I come here as often as possible. - Come on! - What are you doing? Let's go out. - It's raining! - Yeah, and? This is classic! - Can I help you? - No, it's okay, thanks. We'll go out into the middle and finally get started. - Get started? - Yeah, damn it! - Hello. - Hi. - Your visitor still there? - No. I'd like to show you something, if you'll let me. If you must. Wait a minute. Sebastian is finally ready for it. After 11 years, he's finally tackling Rachmaninov. The highlight of the afternoon will be a little piano recital. - What are you doing there? - Nothing. Comparing shoes. - Lucy's here. - Who? The weiner. Up on the terrace. - What's she doing here? - I'd love to know. Distract her, Helge. Pretend you're me. - Do what? - Be me, pretend! I don't know... Okay. Hello. I'm Sebastian... - Bernstein. Can I help you? - Hello, I'm Lucy. I'm with the catering here, but all the trays are gone. We've another buffet inside, we could have a look there. Come on. This is called bondage. Tying one another up. - I'm sure you're into that. - Me? - Are you into this? - Yes! I don't have that much time. I love it when you talk like that. How? As if you weren't even interested. Okay. Then go lie down on the bed. - You play the piano? - No, I'm not musical at all. Not musical? Second prize in the national competition. Oh right. That was a long time ago. Come on. - What are you doing here? - I'm working. This is my friend, by the way. Sebastian Bernstein. Bastian! My darling! Granny! Beloved granny! Let's get something to drink. Come on, Granny. Come on! Probably Alzheimer's. Poor thing. You know what I'm starting to think? You never brought him along... because you were afraid I'd fall in love with him. With him? He's very polite and obliging. Not to mention the 2,000 apartments. And I also like guys with culture and musical talent. - Oh, really? - Can you play the piano? Why? Can you play the piano? I played when I was a child, yes. Good. Then you're the perfect couple. I have to go to the can. Cultured people call it the bathroom. Straight on, second door on the left. One rarely has the chance to talk to someone uninterrupted. You could have told me right away that you're engaged. That's our place. One moment. Oh. Shit! Flin! Wait a second. I was showering, didn't hear... I was showering and didn't hear. Showering! And how was the sex with 'Ello? What's her name again? Super. After you came in again. Sorry. Inken, I think we should have a talk. What about a boat ride? Sure. I'll just get my things, okay? There's a red lamp on. I don't know what it is. Listen, I'd like to go home. Out of the question. All this would've been for nothing... now that the weather's getting nicer. Shit. A 20-mile drive out here, and then nothing works out. I want to go to the hotel. What's he doing here? We just got here. And there's nobody around. - Who's that? - Never mind, come on! - Stop rushing! - Mind your sweet ass. - Shit! - I know her. She's from the real estate agency. Who took the cover off the boat? - Hide! - Why? Please! Otherwise I'm fish food. Someone was messing with the motor. I could've guessed. Now it's wrecked. That was the dentistry student, my daughter's boyfriend. He comes out here to study. A brown-noser and a show-off, pretends to be the Röderer heir. We can forget the boat, sweetie. -Good. Let's go to the hotel. -No, no, no. No, that's no good. Everyone knows me there. Why don't we just stay here? Come on! Okay. Then I'll have to pretend... we're in a fine hotel room. I'm the bored housewife with lots and lots of money. Chipmunk, can't we just bonk like normal people do? And you're the gigolo... The gigolo I just phoned up. So now you go out and come back in when I call you. And then you do what I want. Okay. Come in. Take off your clothes. Ladies and gentlemen, would you all please come to the piano. My son will play the piano concerto in D major from Rachmaninov. Hey! The son of the family is playing Rachmaninov now, right? Uh, I can't play piano all that well... I can't play for all these people here. What? Oh, come on. I'm sure you play brilliantly. - Can you play piano? - Oh yes, since she was a child. That's great, you could play an introduction piece. You won the prizes, not me. Yeah. Ah, there you are! This young lady plays the piano. She'd love to open the concert. - What? - Yes? Gladly! Come. Don't worry. Come with me. As soon as you sit down at the piano... your nerves will settle down. Paul? Paul? Excuse me. May I? Rachmaninov! Let's get out of here. Is that meant to be funny? And just look at you! I like the way he looks. Who are you anyway? I'm with him. Let's go. How dare you affront our guests! Sebastian, I'm talking to you! You're not Sebastian, are you? - And who's that? - My friend Helge. I'm Sebastian. And that's my father... - and this is my girlfriend, Lucy. - No, I'm not your girlfriend. Fuck you. You're all crazy. Lucy! Unh! Unh! Unh!... Sorry for interrupting... but I have to catch my bus. Maybe you'll find an apartment for us. Well, I've got to be going, too. Say hello to your wife for me. The bus stops here? I don't think he'll tell your girlfriend. "I just saw your boyfriend behind the sofa with another girl... I was just playing a little game with my mistress". Of course he won't. Men know how to behave in critical situations. Do they? Men! Even impostors? Whose car is this, your mummy's? No, it's my girlfriend's. Huh. Okay. Can't you speed up a bit? If she finds out about this, she'll scratch my eyes out! It's so lovely here. I think it's going to rain. Can you give me a hand? If we don't hurry, we'll get wet. - Everything okay? - Fine! Then come on! Rowing? Right! - Flin? - What? - I think we have a problem. - Shit, what's happening? - Flin. - What did you do, Inken? I pulled the plug by mistake. We're going under! Inken. Shit! - I'm sorry. Don't rock it. - Let me go! - Oh, Inken! - Ohh! Everything okay? I mess up everything. Doesn't matter what I do, I mess it up. And then I have to shell out money. I'll just get older and older and lose more... and more contact lenses. And then I have to pay health insurance... and for a pension I won't ever get. And tons of rent, and a car, and car insurance! It's all money, money, money! Hey, Inken, it's not that bad. I don't want to grow up. It just costs tons of money and means working your ass off. - What? - I don't know. It's all a bit strange, isn't it? Flin, you're such a wet rag. Let yourself go for once! Just take it easy, Inken. You can't just turn it on like that. And your neighbor? Doesn't he want you? Is that what's the panic? There's no panic, I just like you, that's all. Okay, then let's keep on sipping tea... - Just take it easy, okay? - You're such a tea-totaler! I thought I was a wet rag. How often have we slept in the same bed? If you'd drunk something stronger than tea something might have happened! Anyone ever tell you what a pain in the ass you are? And impatient! If you want something, it has to be right away! And you can be really annoying! And have you ever said thanks? No! And you're so clumsy... I'm constantly afraid you'll break your neck. And what do you want now? Sex on the riverbank, or what? It'd make a change from drinking tea! And I do say thanks. Maybe not always. Maybe not enough. Hey. Lena! I've just been trying to reach you. - I wanted... - Just a second. It'll be on any moment. You have to hear this. Sit down. Wait! Mommy, Mommy can we have noodles again? Of course you can! ♪The noodles are Kirnberger! My music. I made some money from my own music. Okay, it's an ad for noodles, but... It doesn't matter, Lukas. It's great that you've sold something. - But? - It's just... I tried to cheer you up so often, and you were always depressed. And now this little noodle ad can make you so happy? Yes. If you love someone, you understand. Love is making one another happy. We don't. It's also helping one another in unhappy times. - You're always unhappy. - No. Not now. Can't we try again? No, Lukas, we can't. I just came over to give you the key. - Do you like concerts? - Me? No. I'm finished with concerts. And I don't want to wait around outside... until you stagger out with your band. No more creative depression... and spending half my life in a stinking practice room. And I don't want to take the rubbish out... just because you don't want to catch a cold! What rubbish? You don't even know me. I do! Yes, I do! I could still help you. Thanks, we'll manage. Without connections. I can find an apartment in the papers. And now? Well... You can come up with me if you like. Love to. But don't go getting any ideas. Of course not. Hello? Paul? The apartment's on the 7th floor, but they're putting in a lift. For 480 euros, you'll get a one-room dump in a high-rise building. If it's no good, we can ask Sebastian's father... Hey, let's have a look at it first. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. Oh, I don't believe it. It's so big! And it really costs 480 euros? Under certain circumstances, yes. But you must finish the redecorating. But we'll cover the costs, of course. That's super. We love redecorating. I'll wait downstairs, okay? Lena! How did you ever find this place? Well... I have my connections. Well, I'll be damned! Oh God! I eat chocolate when I'm frustrated. Then I can't lose weight, so I get more frustrated and eat more chocolate. You animal! Your mother answer's the readers' letters in "Bravo Girl"? Since when do boys read "Bravo Girl"? Since today. "Dear Leonie, don't worry about your tampon problem. Her first time, my daughter Lucy used an applicator... and she inserted the applicator along with the tampon". Funny. Very funny. Edit and sync of dCd subtitles by your friend, Quester.
