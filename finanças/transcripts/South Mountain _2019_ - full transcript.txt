Hey, no. Ah, stop it, hey! I'll sometimes be a hound. A hog. A hog. A headless bear, sometimes a fire. Who neigh and bark and grunt and roar and burn. Come on. Did you do that? Here you go, more veggies. Dara? Dara? It's still too dry. You're gonna start a fire. But you're right here! Darling. Come eat! Sam's bringing ice? He's supposed to. Good 'cause these coolers are a mess. Yeah she left over an hour ago with Em. Still no meat? No more dead things for me. That's too bad. I'm kind of worried. Lila, stop it. Are you tracking her phone? Almost here. Ooh, she stopped at the falls. Hmm, what is she doing at the falls? She's gonna be gone for several weeks. What do you think her and Emmi are doing? Arguing. I don't think she's ready to sail out on the Atlantic alone. She's not gonna be alone. She's gonna be part of a crew. She's gonna be okay. I know. Hey Jake, Jake. Yeah? Those fridges are too full. Stick these back in the creek - and get your sister to help. - All right. Beer please. Thank you, I'm a victim. Mom, I'm gonna have one too, okay? No. What time should I have Jake and Charlotte ready tomorrow? For camp? Six? That's early. Are you dropping Sam off? No, Emmi's dropping Sam to the port so we can drop the kids at camp and then he has a red eye to catch. I'm worried about traffic but I think everything's gonna be okay. Staying positive. I thought you were all done with LA. I'm done, but script's not. They paid you yet? What? Mind your own business. Edgar. It's funny. No it's not. I'm gonna put the burgers away. Sweetheart will you just make sure you save one for Dara? She's not gonna eat it. Dara? - Grill's done. - It's not like I was him but I guess I kind of felt everything he was feeling. Yeah but now you'll never really know 'cause you had a dream about it and now you have this idea about what it should be. Did mom say you could have that? Yeah. Charlotte's smoking now. Hey! In her dreams. She had a dream about it and now she actually has to smoke to see if it was right. Do it. No, I don't have to because I already know how it is. You think you know. Jeez. Let's get Grenadine. Don't move. Good one, ladies. All right, it's not funny. Did you eat? No sugar until you've eaten something. Not with your hands. Whatever. Baby, get a broom. But you said not to move. Dara, just get a broom. Edgar, don't take a call just now. Just producers. They're not gonna be reachable later. Hey. Gimme a second. Hold on a second. What's going on? Hey Edgar, it's me. We're here. No, no, no, no put that down. That's two weeks early. Yeah two weeks for you. You should have called sooner. Well we had other things to think about. Yeah, I'm sorry. That's okay. - Yeah, I got it, I got it. - Please, can I talk to Gemma? Hey Gemma, I have Edgar on the phone. Do you wanna talk to him? Hi, hey. You okay honey? Please. Let this be over. Edgar, can you hold on for a minute? I think she's having a contraction. - How far apart are they? - Breathe, Gem. Easy. They're nine minutes apart, nine minutes. Gemma. Gemma, can you see me? Can you see me? Actually I got it from here. He's almost here. - Yes. - Yes, you're almost done. He's almost here. Almost here. Almost here. Edgar? I'm on the phone. Hey, this is gonna take as long as it takes and then I'll have to turn pages around by tonight. Well, I'm just worried Sam's not back yet. Call her. I did, she's not picking up. Her phone's still at the falls. Well then she's probably at the falls. She's fine. Ossie, come here. You okay? Mom. Sam? Sorry. I had a migraine coming on. - I had to walk it off. - You should lie down. It's fine, let me help. Emmi. Did you eat? Uh no. Can I pack you something to go? Oh no, I'm sorry I gotta go, thank you. Hey, I'll see you tomorrow, - okay? - Hey. Bye buddy. Bye guys. You okay? Yeah. Are you sure about tomorrow? I'll pick you up at six. Good. Bye, guys. - Come on. - Bye, Emmi. Bye. Everything all right? Mom, this is Jonah. He's taking my shift at the coop while I'm on the boat. - Hi, hello. - Hi. He taught that biodynamic farming workshop - I told you about. - Yeah. Please eat. And I think you should lie down. - Have a burger. - Mom, stop. - Here. - Stop. Burger? Please. Well I think that's homemade onion rings. Where's Dad? Guess. On the phone? On my fingers? Work, work, work. You gonna eat? Do you hear it? Do you hear the heartbeat? Edgar, do you hear the heartbeat? Yeah. You okay? Sounds good. Sounds strong. Hand me that tea. My mouth, it's dry as shit. How dilated is she? About seven, seven centimeters. Seven centimeters. Seven centimeters? What's going on? Oh my god, oh my god. Is that it? Yeah, here. I don't feel it. It's very deep. Like a treasure. That's it. Wouldn't it be great if he just chopped him up and that was it? Dora? You sure you want me crowding your last few weeks of peace? Yes please. 'Cause it's not gonna be pretty. I'll try to remember that. Please do. Ugh. Right? Is he a ghost or a real guy? A ghost but he's real when he's killing people. That's stupid. Mama, your poor boob. I don't want them to cut into it. Me neither. But it's done its big job. You're finally weaned, right? Mom, don't be disgusting. Go watch if you want to. Go, off! Go watch. Sauna? Sauna. Oh, sorry. - Didn't know you're here. - No. We can go. Sorry, we didn't know - you were here. - No, it's okay. We've been here a while, we can go. We can come back later. No, nobody's gotta go, we all fit. Oh you can't do that in here. In the heat, can you? We're keeping that tray down. You at the co-op this summer? Lila and I worked at the co-op about a million years ago. I think everybody out here has at some point. Where are you from? Oregon. That's a long way from home. It's all home. It can't all be home, then none of it's special. It's all special. You smoked enough. I'm teasing. You ready to go? Yeah in a little bit. Did Sam tell you about her sailing trip? Yeah she told me. Yeah but she's taking Prozac which doesn't work if you smoke pot. Lila, stop. Well, we're just talking. Well she hasn't taken Prozac in three months. What? Sam told you she was gonna stop the meds. She also told you she still smoked pot on occasion. So Sam says that you're an artist. I teach. Where? The community college. Biodynamic farming, that's Steiner, right? Yeah it's approaching the whole farm as a living organism. Treating it like an energetic life force. You have to study a long time? Not in a building, books or loans or anything but, I study all the time. What are you studying now? Right now I'm reading The Critique of Reason by Kant. Nobody really reads Kant. You can read my margin notes. No, that's okay. You studying anything? Inertia. Push, push for me. - Push. - I see it! There's a head, - There's a head! - Gemma, Gemma. You got this, come on. You're so close. Please. - Come on, Gemma. - Oh my god! Push, Gemma, Gemma, Gemma, push. Push, please push. - Camera, camera! - I see hair, I see hair! He has curly hair like you! Push, push. Yeah, more, more. You did it, you did it, you did it, you did it. Oh my god. You're my baby. Oh my gosh. You did good, you did good. My baby. You did so good, my goodness. This is my baby. Oh he's so beautiful. Oh so cute. You wanna lie down, baby? Wanna sit down? You're okay like this. Like this baby. It's so bright outside, I know. Maybe you're cold. Maybe you're cold a little bit. Oh my god. Hey can you believe it? You did it. Oh man. Chloe, Mira. We're gonna miss you. You have the cooler? I do. All right, see you Sam. Have fun on your boat ride. Bye. Good night. Good night. You okay? Bye. Bye. Go to sleep early. See you at the crack of dawn. Six? Good night. Good night. Bye. Thanks for the salad. Yeah. I gotta pack. Gigi. You need to take a Vicodin. I'm not taking the Vicodin. No, I'm not taking it. Flush it for me. Don't be brave. No, no. I mean it, flush it. I'm serious. Look I'll smoke a joint if I have to and I'm gonna focus on these pain buns. I'm not going to flush them. What do you call that thing they live in? All the tunnels that connect? A warren? Warren. Hi, sweetheart. Hey, you still in bed? No. No. You're in the garden, aren't you? What are you doing up so early? Couldn't sleep. Is this a good time? 'Cause I could call you back later. No, no, this is a good time. How's Gigi? Sure she's okay? She's fine. Any infections? No infections. She's just, she's tired. I gotta tell you something about Gemma. I thought you said that you weren't seeing her anymore. Edgar. How long? What? God! God! You can stay a couple nights in the girls' room but I need you to find someplace else. I wasn't planning on staying here. We found a sublet in Brooklyn. They're coming next week. The city? I take it you were paid then? No. In fact the production company is filing for bankruptcy next week. So you haven't even been working. I have a ghostwriting gig coming up. She still write for that stupid television show? Yeah. You should write for TV. I don't wanna write for TV. I have a check I can deposit in a couple weeks. All this stress, are you happy? Yeah. No, I'm not happy when you're not happy. But otherwise, yeah, I'm happy. And I think I make her happy. No. You made me happy. Maybe sometimes, but, mostly you pretend to be happy. Because you're not there. Because you lie to me. When you lie to her, is she happy? I don't lie to her. You will. I have to find my passport. Where do you think you're going? I'm not going anywhere. It's just something grownup people should have. And when she's not happy anymore, Edgar, will she pretend for you? She will. She's younger and she's got money too so you're gonna have to become a better liar for her than you were for me. You know that, right? Don't walk away from me. Don't walk away from me when I'm talking to you. Lila, what do you want? What do you want? I don't know. Lila? Hello? Lila? Jesus. You're taking on this room? Well it's time Sam has her own room. Dara ready to sleep on her own? She's gonna have to be. This is for soup, right? Take it. I thought you were picking me up today. Oh, god, I'm sorry, - that was today. - No, that's fine. I called my sister. She came and got me. - No, no, no, no. - No, it's funny, she is sweet, actually. And we went back to her place after. She gave me my aunt's drum and found this sweet young thing to come over and give me a lesson. It got my heart really beating. I asked her to drive me to the next session - as well. - You don't have to do, - don't have to do that. - No, it's fine. I want to, it's good for us. How's Edgar? No, I would say it's not good. I mean it's, when he was away working, it felt different and I could imagine him coming back, but this is like, I don't know. This is like he got ripped away, like, like he's dead. That kind of absence is suffocating. I mean I, I think that it will be good for us to take space and make room, because if we make room then we can begin to forgive each other. There's still a we? Of course there is. We went through this before, you know that. Oh Lila, yes, I remember. Yeah we worked it out before, we're gonna work it out this time. Not with a baby. Well that's how I got Sam. No, that was totally different. Maddie died. This woman has a baby and an apartment in the city. You should be careful with that. Have you even seen this baby yet? No. Have the girls? Because they don't know about it and he hasn't posted anything. Well, she will have. Stop it. I found her. Stop. Lila you should look. You know, I don't tell you what to do with your cancer so please don't tell me what to do with Edgar. They're not exactly equivalent. Yeah of course not, because nothing compares with cancer. Oh we're competing now? You see, you never believed in us. You just thought that this was all about Maddie and that I'm some sort of substitute. Oh I never said that, you said that. No. Don't be an idiot! I don't have time for this. Yeah. Neither do I. Oh. Well there's room for more. Edgar has to go through the rest of his stuff. When's he moving out? Who said he was moving out? I mean I just ran into Gigi at the co-op. I asked if, She tell you about the baby too? Oh. Take it. No. It's all right. Take it. Take it or empty your truck. How far is she? Nova Scotia. For real? She's not sick anymore. She said the trick is that you look at the ocean and then you don't feel so trapped. Did you tell her? Well, I just told her that you were working. I really should get back to the city. You were gonna show me some bills. I paid the cellphones but we still have to pay the mortgage. You know I was cleaning out the spare room and I saved the table chairs for you so I don't know maybe you wanna just go back up there and see if there's anything that you want. It's a sublet, it's already furnished. You still have the high chair. She had a shower in LA so we don't need anything. I could take care of these. How? Archangel Michael. My brother wants to buy Archangel Michael. The house is yours, Lila. But if you feel like you can't pay the mortgage or, you should just sell. I mean, 30 minutes north you could find something bigger, cheaper. I wasn't pretending, Edgar. Don't. Don't what? Don't be nice to me. Why not? Because I can't. God it's hard enough to live one life, I can't even imagine what it's like to live two. Well it's a mistake you would never make. Well, I could accept Gem. I can love your son. Stop. I've done it before. I love Sam. I know, I know. But we can't do this anymore. There's just nothing that I could tell the girls that would stop them from hating you if you leave again. It wasn't just me that hurt them last time. Yeah well this time, it's on your terms so if you turn that down, it's on you. - Don't. - Don't what? Don't bait me into humiliating you. You've already humiliated me. Repeatedly. We can't be married anymore. Are you done? Yeah, I really should get going. Edgar. This is really, no but there's left for you to run from, I mean, the least you could do is finish your meal. All right. Could you pick some blackberries in a minute? Have the ants started coming in the house yet? Lila? It's a little bitter. I used Stevia, maybe not enough? No, I mean it's fine, it's fine, it's just, You're right. - No, no, don't. - No. No, I didn't mean to be critical. It is too bitter, okay, I'm sorry. What, what are you talking about? Lila? Drink this. You need to vomit. - Wha... - I fed you Gigi's Vicodin. - What? - Yeah. How much? Drink it. I don't know how much. We can talk about this later. You have to drink this! Now! Whole thing. Fuck! Fuck. Now this. You tried to kill me! No, I don't know. I don't know what I was doing. I don't know why. I just had to do something, that's what I did. Yeah you're fucking crazy is that's what. My god, you're crazy. I stopped, told you. It's out of your system. No. Why? Why did you do this? It was too easy for you. I feel fine. I'm just gonna go home. Hold on. I don't think you should drive, okay? Pulse is fast. I'm gonna take you to a hospital. You're not gonna take me to the hospital. What are you gonna say? The truth. And get arrested? Is that what you want? No. No. No, no, no, no, no. I'll be fine. Lila. I'll clean your shirt. I don't know. Yeah, no I don't want you to come up because then if it's the flu or something then you guys get sick. I'm just gonna rest up and when I feel solid I'll make my way home. Me too. Okay, give him a kiss for me. Bye. Are you gonna tell her? Well, she's already scared that you're gonna murder her in her sleep. No, I want her to be awake. A joke. We still need a new screen door? It doesn't matter. Unless the bugs fly in. It's a good house. Yeah. Is it okay if I fall asleep? No, not yet. Can I see him? I need you to get a truck here by Saturday. What's the big rush? Just, we need to do this before the girls get home. I just want this place intact, so. I can pack your stuff. I'll try to get a truck here by the weekend. Hi, this is Edgar. I'm not here but leave a message. It's me, confirming the truck is all set for tomorrow. So let me know what time you'll be there. Hi, this is Edgar. I'm not here but leave a message. Are you coming today? I'd like to start painting up there. Hi, this is Edgar. I'm not here but leave a message. Edgar, it's me again. You said you were gonna have a truck here yesterday. You need to call me back. Try it. Go on. What, no? Okay. My yarns. Stop it. You're done. Yeah so we've been talking about getting a place. If we could save up enough money, you know, we were thinking about getting a piece of property up in Maine. Maybe grow some Shiitake mushrooms and raspberries. What? Okay I'm just gonna shut up. No. Careful, I have to ship that. Is this Catholic? Russian Orthodox. I contorted for Edgar's parents. I'm a Pantheist. So you believe in everything. Everything. Oh, that sounds like a lot of work. I have trouble believing in one thing. See I think it would be hard to believe in just one thing. I mean how do you know what that one thing is? Whatever stops you from killing yourself. You think about killing yourself? I think everybody thinks about killing themselves. That kind of pain isn't special? My mother killed herself when I was eight. How? She immolated herself on a rock in the middle of a creek so the woods wouldn't catch fire. It was by this Buddhist monastery. I mean she wasn't even Buddhist. She wrote a note about what to do with her books and her clothes. But she didn't say why. You must hate her. Why would I hate her? For leaving you. I don't really remember her. Just her voice. Sam doesn't remember her mom either. How old was she? She was five. She was my best friend from college. This was Maddie? Do you remember anything from when you were five? See I remember when I was four, vividly, burning my hands trying to make tea. I remember a dog. I think it was, I was six. I was being a real asshole to it and it bit me. Right here, actually. I just, I remember at first I was really scared and angry. But then I was just sad it didn't like me. You have a tick. What? Okay. Hold still. You should take some antibiotics. Don't laugh at me. I used to take Sam back here when she was little. And once we cut to the woods from the house and got completely lost. I pretended that I knew where I was going but still made Sam go up the hill to find a view but I had no idea. How'd you get back? We heard dogs barking and we found the road. But I still don't know if Sam knew she was lost or not. I think it's gonna rain. See, you gotta move. Move where? Anywhere. Move next door. Go get lost in this mountain. Just run away. Children get to run away. Not parents. So what do you do if you can't run away? I tried to poison Edgar. Why? I don't know, I think, where there's love, there's a potential for violence. Poison isn't violent. On the inside. You ever think about poisoning me? No. No, poison is for liars. And you haven't lied to me, have you? Where's my phone? Jonah. Edgar? Who the hell is in the fucking driveway? I can't pull up. All right, yeah. Just wait one minute. I'll be down to deal with it. Edgar's here with the truck. I don't think your clothes will be dry. So here, take this, and I'll call you later. Why don't I just stay and help? No. Well I can just hang out back here. No, I really, I just need you to leave. You can come back later. Wait, what? No, this just really isn't any of his business. Are you embarrassed of me? I didn't say that. So I'm not important enough - to be his business? - You need me to tell you that you're important? Yeah? No. You're not important to me. And I'm not important to you. Here. You need to get up and you need to go. No. What do you mean no? No. I don't just let people throw me away like I'm trash. This isn't your house. Clearly it's his. No, it's my house. My house. Get out. Get out! What's wrong with you? There's nothing wrong with me. You don't tell Sam! Come on. Lila! Lila! Lila? What are you doing here? You were supposed to be here yesterday. Well I called you three times this morning. I turned my cellphone off. Where is my table upstairs? At the landfill. I told you, I had to paint. I thought you said you didn't want anything. I said I didn't need anything. Need and want are two different things. I'm gonna take that table. Fine. You can have your little friend build you a new one. I need a screwdriver. You know where they are. Is this the only screwdriver we have? You don't need a screwdriver, they screw out. He can't build one as simple as this. The screwdriver's mine, by the way. Is it you? It's me. All right, so they said I had to play bottom and I didn't want to at first but it turned out to be totally great. Oh sorry. That's okay. Huh. What? Please? Dara. Dara. Does Sam know? Yeah. I told her yesterday on the phone. Charlotte? No. But Gigi does? Yes. That means Charlotte knows. I don't want a brother. Well you don't have to meet him until you're ready. You know we're still parents and friends but we just won't be married anymore. I don't think you should be friends. Why not? 'Cause it'll just make mom sad again. Where do you live now? Brooklyn. See you tomorrow? You're just gonna give me handfuls of cash from now on? Yeah. See you. I need a napkin. I said I wanted a napkin, not a paper towel. A paper towel can be a napkin. Yeah. But it's not. I'm not even hungry. Well, you can just clean the dishes. I didn't even eat. Well, you still have to help. I wanna stay at dad's tonight. You're staying with him next week. I don't wanna stay here with you. Why? You smell like cigarettes. Well he doesn't have a bed set up for you yet, Dara. All right Dara, just leave the phone alone. So are you gonna kill yourself? What? The last time he left, Dad came back because you were gonna kill yourself. I was very, very sad for a while. Your dad came back because we both wanted it to work out. But not now. Well now it's gonna work out in a different way, your Dad not living here. And Gem and the baby is part of our lives. Just don't go away. Now when you were a little baby you used to dance all night, sleep all day. And I remember holding you up like a doll and we'd dance. You would lie down and sleep for 10 minutes. And I remember lying there thinking that just a small movement of the sun is the only thing that differentiates night from day. Mom, stop talking. We got one walker. I think a walker and four nits. Can I see? Yeah. No lice for me. I have to do you next, Dara. I don't have lice. Come on, you were at the same camp. Yeah. But we don't hang out anymore. Mom, this is really awkward and lame. What happened? Nothing happened. We just don't hang out anymore, right? We don't need to make them do this. Why don't you want to hang out with Charlotte anymore? She doesn't wanna hang out with me. Why? Because we were playing proof or dare and I told Benjie and Yelena that Charlotte liked Darryl. I don't. You said you did. I said he was cute. Is that all you said? I tried to sit with you but you said there was already someone sitting there. It was just an empty chair. I told you. Our invisible rodent was sitting there. I'm more important than an invisible rodent. Hey. How's your sister? She went home. My god. It was the drumming. Shut up, she loved the drumming. Anybody home? You're here! - Oh. - Hi. Ossie wants to come in. Wow, look at this place. I can't believe how much you got done. Mom, you didn't have to do this. I should have done it a lot sooner. These were Maddie's. Sam's baby clothes. Oh my god. Did you ever see these? Is that Maddie? Yeah. She had a sailboat? She had it over the summer. You look just like her. First thing that your mother told me after you were born is that your eyes were like the ocean. I didn't know that. Well I didn't remember until I started cleaning. I dreamed she was on the boat with me. I didn't talk to her. She always had her back to me. She was doing all the technical stuff like tying knots and taking in the sail. She was really good at it. I just want you to know that this room is here for you and Emmi. If you want. You don't have to stay here for me. No. I wanna be here, Mom. I wanna be home. You should tell her. Tell me what? We bought a food truck. A food truck? - Yeah. - Emmi bought it. Yeah. And we're gonna rebuild it together. I wouldn't start taking it out until the spring, but, Where would you go? Local, we'd take it out locally. And if you need me here more - then we can wait. - Hey Lila, here. Sam, we should talk. I don't wanna talk to you. It's okay. I'll go. Ooh, nice spin. I'll take over. Find the other one? Champion ping pong. Playing? Sam like her new room? Yeah, she does. When do you think she might talk to me again? I don't know. When she needs money? Do you have any? You're funny. Whoa, whoa. I forgot how good you are at this. No. Wait, one more. Oh! What, where you going? It's too hot. I gotta get changed. I remember that dress. Dara said I should wear it. Can you button it? When I open my eyes first thing in the morning I still expect to see you. Jake. Jake. What? Enough, gimme the phone. No, I'm in the middle of a conversation. You need to learn to be in a conversation with the people you are actually with. Why, I don't have anything to say to any of you. Then just hang out. And braid hair, no thanks. Give me the phone or it goes away for good. Hello. Hey. Hey. You going hiking? He's going up South Mountain. We're trying to talk him out of it. I hear there's a beautiful view. If you could find it. It's fun. You should come. No thanks. Sam and Emmi can't come. 'Cause we have a life here. Yes we do. Call us if you get lost. Yeah, okay. Yeah it's fine. Just go up in the driveway. Maybe the girls will wanna see the baby. This is weird, you should talk to her. You know, he told us. I'm sorry. I don't want you to apologize. What do you want? I want you to act like my mother. Did you think I was dead? No, you can't die. It's impossible, you'd take this fun away. What angel wakes me from my flowery bed. Pray thee speak again, sweet mortal. Mine ear is much enamored to thy note, such as mine eye enamored to thy shape. And thy gentle force perforth do move me on my first view to say I love thee. You have to inhale. Inhale. Here, I'll show you. Dara, I gotta go. Come see your brother. All right, am I getting it? Yeah, you got it. I can't get my hands... You got it. Sam? Where are you going? I'm going to Emmi's. I don't want you to leave. Mom, you don't need me here to take care of you. Yes I do. And you keep leaving and leaving. And I'll be back. I know. You know this baby's gonna be 25 when you're 75? Which is why he's gonna need you. I got him. I know. He's okay. Shh, shh, shh. There you go. Fast asleep in sister's arms. - Yeah. - So cute. That was you. Aw. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay. Mom? How many? 13.
