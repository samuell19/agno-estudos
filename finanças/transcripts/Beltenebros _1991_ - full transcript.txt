They are looking for us. It's possible. I'm afraid. What's gonna happen with me? I didn't do anything. Come with me. - Where to? - Wherever I go. Let's go, come in. We didn't have time to get the tickets. Can we get them now? To Lisbon. Come with me. I don't want to know. Show me. One moment. Wait here. I came to Madrid to kill a man I've never seen. What happened after that was like the painful awakening of a body and a soul after years of being neglected, or just dead. SCARBOROUGH (UK) 1962 I have a message for you, Darman. What is it? They are offering a Bible from Münster in a very good shape. You have to go to see it. I like to watch them. Can you give them a new life? Where are you? In Poland. Message received. Do you need anything, dear? Try to fix the window in the garage. It was making a noise the whole night. Alright, will do. Were you waiting for a cab, sir? Yes. Captain, captain Darman. I received other orders, and couldn't go to the airport. Don't call me captain. Where can we talk? Here is good. Better to talk in my apartment. Come up in 10 minutes. Yes, captain. What's your name? Luque. Sorry for calling you captain. I heard a lot about you from the old men. The veterans. We, we've just arrived. Everything we know it's from the books. Did you check the money? Which money? In the suitcase. We've waited months for you. I never know what I carry. I'm going back to England tomorrow. Do you have the ticket? I brought you the instructions. Tomorrow flight to Madrid, via Paris. Do you remember the Walter case? It was always kept in secret. No one could talk about it. I am not no one. They sent me to come talk to you because I'm no one. They don't want people to know you are going to the countryside. They just want you to go to Madrid, do your job, and go back to England. Just like back in the days, understand? No, I don't. There is another traitor among us. It's waiting for someone to arrive from Paris and help him to escape. You. Like in the old days. So the meeting is in Madrid? Yes, in an abandoned building near the Atocha station. I have the address. Where is Bernal? Bernal? He is not here. Leave. I won't go to Madrid. Tell them I'm sick. Or that I'm afraid. No one would believe that you are afraid, captain. That man has harmed our organisation. He was the one responsible and denounced everyone. Doesn't deserve to go on living. If I could, I would go there tomorrow and kill him with my own hands. Just like you did back then. I've never killed anyone with my hands. Tell them I lost my skills. That you saw my hands shaking. Tell them whatever you want. Captain… Darman! He is innocent! You should kill me! Me! Captain, you should come with me. What did they tell you to do, in case I say no? I told you that Bernal wasn't here. My mistake again. I'm sorry. Come, captain. Darman. Long time no see! Not that much. Just half of a lifetime. To get old is humiliating. Today one of my daughters got married. Her husband comes from around here. Just like the music that's playing and the language they are speaking. My daughter couldn't forget her father's country, simply because she doesn't know it. They told me you wouldn't come. That you didn't want more problems. I understand. But I knew you would come. I didn't come. I was betrayed. Don't mind Luque, he is too young. Come closer. Darman, we were betrayed. Lately he is being saying his name is Andrade. Roldán... Andrade. You don't know him. When he became director, you were already in England. One and half years ago he went back to the countryside. After seven months, all those who knew him, started to fall. The police knew about it. True evidence, letters, prints, meeting places. We started to suspect. They would never catch him. He always managed to escape shortly before the police would arrive. That was until one month ago. This time they got him. We were told that he was being tortured, and yet, wouldn't say a thing. We stopped suspecting and started to trust him again. But… we found something important. He had open a bank account and put a considerable sum in it. We don't know where it comes from. There was also a woman, She is a singer, or even something worst. We know little or nothing about her. Goes to expensive places, luxurious restaurants, fancy clothes. We always start with a photo. Something else? Yes. Three days ago he called us from Madrid. He had escaped. He was about to go to another prison, and managed to escape from the police truck. Just like that. Handcuffed, surrounded by guards, right in front of the Department of Security. Isn't a miracle? And now he asking for some money, and a passaport so he can leave the country. You are the one who is gonna take it to him. The police doesn't know anything about you. You don't exist for them. People can't know that a traitor has reached the high orders of our organisation. He has to die without a drawing much attention... Simply disappear. And no one is capable of tailing a man, or handling a gun like you. I'm no longer like I used to be. We all change. It's not right. People don't change. He does. Now he is a traitor. Maybe he has ever been but we just realised it now. Do you remember Walter? For such a long time he was pretending. Walter. I'm not the only one who didn't forget. To forget is a luxury, Darman. A check, a woman, nightlife, detained comrades, an escape. Hard to believe... Something more? And a very convincing theory. I don't think you've heard of Comissar Ugarte. He is the one in charge of the police center in Madrid. A calm hunter, always in the dark. Doesn't have a past. Has barely a face. We believe he is the one behind everything. He pays Andrade, and when is afraid that we gonna get him, he puts him in jail. So other prisoners can see that he was tortured during the questioning. Then, they organized such an incredible escape that makes him look like a hero. The betrayal goes on forever like that. Did you go to Madrid? Who, me? Yes, you. Did you go? I see you are not that isolated. Yes, I went to Madrid. I was talking like them. A general, who may be more even more reactionary. What for? We agreed to look for other alternatives to put an end to Franco's regime. Another way to stay in the fight. Are there any other ways? Not right now. You are being called at the headquarters. Go immediately. Please, hold this for me, Sergeant. - It's not this way. - Of course it is. Miss Bacon! Miss Bacon! I wasn't allowed to speak with you according to the rules. Do you understand? If you are after Colonel Sheridan, it's this way. I'm sorry if I sounded rude, but as a guard, we are not supposed to talk. - And why didn't you say? - Because I wasn't allowed to talk! - You couldn't talk! - Yes, no talking. Thank you very much. Now that I'm here… Miss Bacon! Wait, I want to tell you something. I also come from Monroe. Now I have to go. Please, call Colonel Sheridan for me. And tell Uncle Phil, that you were with me. - Uncle Phil? - The Colonel. Is he your uncle? How did you find the book? I didn't finish it. Better like that. Don't finish it. Captain Darman, when the movie is over, I will be waiting for you outside in the street. Now I have to go. If I come by your house around 9 tonight, do you think you would be sitting on the porch? Life is full of surprises. If I happen to see you sitting there, then we could maybe go for a walk. We go for walks since we’ve met. I couldn't think of anything better than to walk by your side in life. Finally, people remembered we exist. It was about time for someone to come. She is Rebeca. And I'm Walter. You must be Darman. Exactly. Your face looks familiar. Maybe we met during the war. Maybe. He brought a message from Paris. A message? We need money. Money and guns, not messages. We need people to come back. From Paris, from Moscow. That people come back and help us. Here a man can't take more than 4 or 5 months. When one falls, another one must come and replace him. Like that, we are eternally losing ours. You lasted more than 4 years. I barely take risks, I almost don't go out and I have some experience. I hope to still last quite a while. Now, the allies won the war, it'll be different. The allies? Whose allies? Ours, no? They never cared about us actually. For them, we are worth less than any tribe from Africa. The allies will invade Spain, just wait and see. Do you wanna come with me? Valdivia is here, no? - Do you know him? - Yes. Rebeca will take you to see him. Tell him that the allies will soon be crossing the Pyrenees. If we are lucky, when they arrive will heal our wounds. Welcome to Madrid. Thank you. Don't worry about Walter. You have to excuse him. The last years have been quite hard for everybody. He is here. Watch your step. We are walking over the living room. Look who is here! Your name is Darman now, right? Darman... Yes. Seven years. More or less. And here we are again. Everything around us collapsing. Dead people, people in the jail, missing people… And here we are, I and you, right at the heart of the disaster. Keep the fight going. No one will beat us. You also left. That's what we decided. Some of us escaped, others have stayed. The war was the same. The enemy was the same. You don't know what it means to be here. I saw other things, that in the end were not better and ... I'm here, right? I have to go to work. Make sure not to smoke too much and not to talk too much. I trust you. He is still quite weak. You don't seem that weak. It's because I'm not. The bullet went through my shoulder, nothing serious. But it got infected and I got fever. Walter brought me some penicillin. I wonder how could he get it. - You've never smoked. - Now I do. For me it sounds a bit strange to call you Darman. Is it English? It's universal. Do you live well? That's hard to say. But if there is a reason for it to be, nothing else really matters. I came to kill in order to stop ours from dying. Right? This is what matters. I need to know everything about Walter before I kill him. I just want to be sure he is the traitor. I've never worked with him. I just heard about him. And… I assure you that he has a great reputation. But they started to put people in jail, and all the speculation, until it was confirmed. He was the one who was eliminating our people. He set me up. - You? - Yes. He wanted to get rid of me as soon as possible. When he found out that you were coming I'm sure he thought we had found him. You scare the people, Darman. You didn't know that? Her as well. Does she agree with you? Walter gives her some ideas and she finds a way to include them in the novels she writes. No one comes to this cinema. Why did you betray us? - Why do we betray? - I don't know. Out of exhaustion. Being isolated just finishes with you. You lose your ideals and are left without anything. Maybe someone promises you something. Maybe you get tortured and can't continue. Albeit the war, I remember those years as the best ones. We didn't have to think too much. We just had to believe in ourselves and in the victory. That was enough. The other things came later... living in the underground, the fear, the police. Everything changed. And when you look back, you see that those time were the best times. Don't you think? We had friends and we were young. Maybe I also believed. Do you need anything? No, thank you. I'm bringing you something to read. Can I have one you your books? Of course not. - Leave me one. - Please… I'm just curious. Ok, which one do you want? Even though it's a bit the same thing. They are very similar. Thank you. I know it. Are you there? Come on, let's go. A cognac? No, not today. Comissar. We followed him to a building near the station. She was also there. She also lost him. Let her go. She will be more useful if she is free. Don't tell her the anything. Anything. We are closed. Come back another day. I can't come another day. I'm just visiting. When it gets too crowded we close it. Today it's full. Would you like a drink? Yes. Is it your first time here? Try the “Polinesian... It's their specialty. Unique in Madrid. The great attraction will start in 10 minutes. Thank you. Who are you? Clients are not allowed in the backstage.. I'm a friend of Andrade. I brought something for him from Paris. I think you are mistaken. I don't know anyone with that name. Did he give you the novels by Rebeca Osorio? It must be difficult to find them now. I am Rebeca Osorio. You wrote this? Pure coincidence. Someone had the same name as me. Had? Or still has, who knows. Why did you choose this name? I didn't choose it, it's my name. It was never someone else's. Now it is. Can you close the door when you leave? I don't know this... What did you say? I had a meeting with him this afternoon. In the warehouse. When I got there, he wasn't. Which warehouse? The same where you lost this a few hours ago. I brought him passport and money. If they find him first, they gonna hold hi. And this time he won't escape. If you know where Andrade is, tell me. They promised they would send someone. But no one came. The police was after him. His hands got infected. Where did he go? I don't know. He was afraid. He knew they would find him. They followed you. How do you know? I was there. I've never been followed before. They didn't need you. Why they let you go? I don't know. Is your name really Rebeca? No. They are waiting for you. Hurry up. I will until you are back. I'm not coming back tonight. Tell me where I can wait for you. If you don't, I will have to follow you. I could trick you. If you care about Andrade, you won't. I have your passport. Please. Give it to me. I'm only allowed to give it to him. Those are my orders. I'm not lying. If you want him to be alright, help me to find him. And how do I know this isn't another trap? I don't even know you. What are you doing? Not looking at you. Before you were payed to look at me. We met here a couple of times. This is really far, some taxi drivers don't know about it. That's the closest metro. Hurry up. Wait for me, be patient. Maybe I will come. Don't worry. I will be there. Don't leave right away. Wait until I'm gone. Wait here. Something else, comissar? No. I call you if I need anything. I saw your show tonight. And did you like it? Yes. I was impressed. Very impressed. What do you want me to do? I want you to put this on. Just this. What about you? What about me? Are you from the police? What if I am? Am I the first police to be with you? No. So, what does it matter? It's just that I was taken by the police this afternoon. But they let me go. Yes, I know it. I don't know what they wanted. Of course you do. They are looking for a man. And you? Maybe I'm also looking for a man. But not now. Maybe I'm looking for… something else. Or for another man, but not now. What do you want now? I want you to put this on. Like this? Are you afraid? No, it's just that I can barely see you. The light is bothering me. It hurts my eyes. IS it better like this? Yes. Have a seat. Am I doing it right? Why did you choose the name of Rebeca? Because I like it. What is it wrong with it? Nothing. Do you want me to do something more? To take off my clothes? Or to sing? Later. Now you are good like this. It turns me on. A pity that you don't know where to find you friend. They are looking for him to kill him. I'm not too worried about your man. I'm more interested in being good for you. Come, go to the other room. Don't turn the lights on. Take off… your stockings. But no hurry. Turn around. Seat here. Listen to me. I know that someone is betraying us. We are one of the few to still survive. We are disappearing now for fear and the betrayal. Everyone is a suspect. Everyone is suspecting. It's a nightmare! What do you have waiting for you in Paris? I don't know. Then, why did you come? No one should know. Tell me, they don't trust me anymore right? I will be gone in a few days. You can go whenever you want. I will tell you something. I always kept the calm. I survived a lot, through the hardest times.. And always calmly. What do you want? Don't judge me from what you saw tonight. I'm Walter's wife. Your friend is staring at me, he is following me, he needs me. He is lonely and wounded. It is hard to not take care of him. Why are you telling me this? I don't know. I came to talk to you about something else. We all know that there is a traitor. But it's not Walter. He is a loyal man. He has fought since the beginning. I don't know who betrayed you. But don't make a mistake. Because you will pay with you life. Are you done? I didn't save any money by buying rotten meat! And I didn't give them food for pigs! I didn't call them thieves when they were complaining! Damn thief! Now you are regretting! You have no authority to talk to me like that! Don't I? You'll see! Walter! Walter! Darman! He is innocent! Kill me! You are wrong! Kill me! Darman! Kill me! Me! Darman! What are you up to? Work. He didn't believe me either. Andrade? Who else? He had to come. Didn't have anywhere else to go. What if he doesn't trust you anymore? The police found out about the warehouse. Maybe he will think you betrayed him. No. He knows I would never do it. What's the problem? I'm tired. I need a drink. - You want one? - Yes. Tell me about Andrade. How did you meet? When did you see him the last time? You seemed to know so much. Are you starting to doubt your informations? Tell me about him. Well… You all abandoned him. He escaped, but no one helped him. I didn't know anything. Didn't know why they got him, nor what he did. Cheers! He didn't tell you why he was being followed? Told me it was better for me not to know. We've met a few months ago. At the club, he was sitting at a table near the stage. He was alone and watching me. But not like the rest of the audience. When I left the club, I knew he was waiting for me. But he took some time to make up his mind. But when he did, I didn't let him go. And he never said anything? About him, or about his life? Yes, he talked a bit about his family, and about all of you. But that was after. After he escaped from the police. But when he disappeared without a trace I was scared. Then, one night, when I was leaving the club, I saw him at the corner from our first time. He was leaning against the wall, his hands over his belly like he was drunk and could not stand. When I approached him, I saw the handcuffs. He told me that he had been tortured for days. He was really scared. I took food for him to the warehouse. He told me about his comrades. He didn't know why they were taking so long. Yes, you have fever. Why don't you relax and close your eyes? Relax. Stay here and try to sleep. I thought you wouldn't come. But here I am and I have all you need. Here. Passport... tickets… money… and this. How did you get it all? I got it from a man. Why do you ask? He was after you. How did you do? It wasn't easy, but I managed to leave him. What about the gun? It was also his. Now go. Leave Madrid. I can't leave you. Come with me. No. I owe you everything. My life, everything. I will find you. Go, please. We lost the girl. She didn't go back home. And Andrade didn't go to the warehouse. But we have our men everywhere. Now I'm interested in another man. Give his description to everyone: taxi drivers, train stations and airports. Who is it? His name is Darman. Darman? Is Darman in Madrid? If he is not, then we didn't do a good job. - Hello, sir. - Hello. Could you please reserve me a seat in a flight tomorrow to London? Of course, first class? Don't worry, Mr. Darman. Thank you. Can you fix these ruins? Yes, it takes a lot of patience, that's my job. Darman... you have to go to Madrid as soon as possible. You have to kill him. We know that there is a traitor among us. But it's not Walter. Walter is a loyal person. He fought since the beginning. I don't know who may be the traitor. What about Walter's wife? That one disappeared. No one ever heard of her again. And Valdivia? They got him. He was tortured, but he didn't incriminate anyone. Since he wasn't able to stand, the killed him while he was tied up to a chair. Darman! Darman! Kill me! Me, me! Yes? I would like to spend some time with one of your girls. Where? National Hotel. Room? 373. Will be there in 30 minutes. - I want a specific one. - Who? Rebeca. - But the price, - That's not a problem. - She will be there in half an hour. - Right. 373. Come in. He left. Left this morning. You or any other can't harm him anymore. First the money. Check it. I have more if you want. Do you always pay the women? Not always. Not all of them. You have too much money. I don't know what Andrade is doing, or why he has to run away. But you look very good to be one of his friends. I realized it when I saw you. He coudln't pay for this room. But he could pay for you. I was the one who was paying. He didn't have any money. Someone sent a lot of money to his account. But he never touched it. Thought it was a trap. So, I had to pay for everything. Why? Why you ask? I'm in love with him. Is it that hard to believe? I'm jealous, I guess. Didn't he ask you to go with him? Sure he did. Not yet. I want to talk to you. You are not paying me just to talk. What do you know? You are just like that Comisar... the one who asks me to dress other clothes, and looks at me, and touches me. What is his name? Ugarte. How do you know that's the one? Andrade told me. He was who interrogated him. He is also the one who tortures. Did Andrade see his face? No prisoner has ever seen his face. But now he is free from him. From him, and from you. Who are you? Where are you coming from? From very far away. Did you know Andrade? I came to help him to escape. That's not true. You came to kill him. You are dead, there is no blood in your veins! You don't feel anything! You think you can buy me and that you can decide if he dies of lives. You are just like that Comissar! Come on! Fuck me! I have to go. Stop! Don't move! Look at me. I'm Andrade. I'm not gonna use the gun. I just want you to listen to me. I could have escaped. I could have disappeared, but I want that you and the others know... that I was never the traitor. I've never opened my mouth. Andrade, I know it. You have to go now, the police is here. The Comissar... I have to tell you! There is no time left. The Comissar is the traitor. He has all the information. There's nothing he doesn't know. I don't know what... Captain Darman! Bernal sent me. They are looking for you. They are after you. He was not threatening me! You are wrong! Go, Captain, you have to go back to England! “You should be condecorated.” “I'm the best man in the group.” “Look.” “It's not good.” Come, Captain Darman. I could've saved you, but you chose to die. You've been always a hero. Is that true, Darman? Don't move. My men have you under the sight. They can even see your eyes shinning. Not a step closer, Captain. Now you are not that skilled anymore. Nothing like back in the days. You are blind by soberb. You don't even take precautions. I've thought a lot about you during all these years. I knew that soon or later you would come for me. And sometimes I was even afraid. Walter was also afraid. I've heard about you. He knew they were not sending him a messenger but a executioner. I didn't kill him, Darman. You did it. You plotted everything. I killed him, but just beause you had condemned him. Walter and Andrade were not the traitors. They were stronger than their torture. I wasn't. When they caught me, I realized that everything I was doing was useless. I was alone here, Darman. I was working to death. I raised the dead, organized the parties. I was here risking my life While you had your privileges in England, I had nothing but faith in my ideals. I changed sides, so I could destroy what I had created. I wanted to erase the memories of my life, the life you forced me to live as an outcast. And you were directing the party from Europe. Now I'm the one who controls your movements. What did you do with Rebeca Osorio? I loved her. I kept her by my side. One day I told her the truth. She was poisoned by rage. I was forced to sent her to a mental hospital. She killed herself. Why are you telling me all this rubbish? Do you want me to feel sorry for you? No. I thought about a glorious death for myself and I wanted to know from you, if it hurts to think of your comrade being shot while tied up to a chair. Does it hurt? Yes, it does. I thought you were the best. I'm sorry to disappoint you. You will pay for this, Valdivia. For every comrade you tortured, for every free man you put in prison. Shut up! Does the truth hurt? Is that why you want me to shut up? So, someone can't finaly tell you the truth? Are you not scared of the things you've done? The things you are still doing every day? Shut up! Silence! Make him shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Be quiet! The light! Turn off the light! The light! Don't say a word! Turn of the light! My eyes! Kill him! Darman! Shoot him! Darman! Darman! Darman! Look at me, Darman! We are approaching the border. There you may have problems. It would be better if you leave the train and to cross it by foot. They've found you a guide, already. How long until the next stop? Ten minutes. Thank you for everything. Be careful. -Bye. What's wrong? I'm really tired. What are we gonna do? Go on with life. Sometimes they run without knowing who they were running away from, sometimes, they wait without knowing who they are waiting for.
