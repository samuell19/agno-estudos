(musical flourish) (gentle orchestral music) (water rushing) (birds chirping) - [Kramer] When old boatmen trade stories, there are certain places, events which always seem to come up. Lava Falls, The Hole in Crystal, floods of '83 and high water of '74, if you can remember back that far. (engine shuts off) (door slams) But most stories you hear are personal, like this one. - [Steve] You're killing me. You already got more rope than rubber. - [Mikey] I don't wanna take any chances. - [Stan] Let's get running. This is a no-holes, class four river. - [Mikey] Four if you know where you're going, five if you don't. Don't be thinking about going in there blind. Rule of boating. - My name's Kramer. Been that way since the day I met Skinner, Mikey, and Stan. A day that's changed almost every day since. - Look who we got here. - You Kramer? Green River Guides? Did you have a nice trip up here? You uh, you always blab on like this? Okay then, let's go boating. - [Kramer] Looking back now, we probably shouldn't have been out in front of the other boats since the only thing we knew for sure was that there was something big downstream. - [Steve] "Be Yourself." - [Mikey] Graham Nash. - But it has always amazed me how much you can learn about someone just sitting on a boat together. Does this get any wider downstream? - [Stan] This is downstream. - [Kramer] Steve Skinner was the best, but you'd never know it. Came on like he didn't have a care in the world unless something is wrong. And that's when you find out what a boatman's really made of. - Put an extra half hitch in the frame, it won't slip. - [Kramer] I'll just say- - Got this one. - [Kramer] If I'm ever in real trouble, I hope Skinner's there. (water rushing) - No, it's not what I want. Certain things you have to live with. You don't have to like it. - [Kramer] Stan was older than the rest of us. Life had been hard on Stan, so he was kinda hard on life. He was just coming off a divorce that he didn't want. She got custody of the baby boy. He got a lot of time alone to think about it. So you guys are new on this river, too, right? - Yeah, it's our chance to see what's around. Maybe someday we'll have our own outfit. - It's not practical. Too many variables. - [Kramer] Mikey had just passed the LSATs and was soon headed for law school. - Substantial capital investment just to procure permits, equipment, transportation. Can you imagine the liability? Huh? What? - [Kramer] I guess Mikey was sorta of used to having things his way. - It's your world, Mikey. We're just living in it. - [Kramer] The river has a way of changing that in a real hurry. - [Stan] You think we're close? ♪ There's blood around the corner ♪ ♪ Blood around the corner ♪ ♪ Blood around the corner and it's yours ♪ (water roaring) ♪ 'Cause there's blood- ♪ - [Mikey] See, that's it. - [Stan] Maybe. - Me, too. - Was the first rapid a left or a right run? - [Steve] Right, maybe. - [Stan] No, left. - Right. - Right as in left, or right-right? - [Steve] Right. Hard ride. Come on, Mike, you pull. You gotta get us outta here. - Let's go. We're not gonna make it. - [Steve] Pull. Pull. Stan, get up to the front. Put a little weight on the nose. - [Mikey] We're not gonna make it. - [Kramer] Hey, coming to the front. (Mikey grunting) - [Steve] Come on, Mike. - [Stan] Uh oh, it's gonna be big. - [Steve] All you got; don't give up. Good; go there. And don't look back (drowned out by water). Come on, Mike. (men shouting) Hold on! (men whooping) Keep going! (water crashing) (thunder rumbling) - [Kramer] We put on that morning as strangers, but by the end of the trip, we were brothers. We ran together all that summer, plus a couple more after that. - Stan, wanna grab a couple ears of corn outta there for me? While I worked on a mustache, Mikey worked through school. Skinner mostly worked on Stan. (water splashing) (men laughing) (thunder crashing) - Whoa, ho, ho, ho ho! - Flying corns. - [Kramer] Between trips, when other boatmen were running to town to see their girlfriends, we went out on the water taking turns at the oars. (men shouting and whooping) It was just the four of us doing what we loved with the people we loved, and we couldn't imagine things being any other way. - Good boy! - Nice, huh? (somber music) - [Kramer] Until it happened. Things were never the same after that. As I watched Skinner standing in the water, I knew we'd lost more than a friend. We'd lost the river. We all stayed in touch for a little while, but life keeps you so busy with what's in front of you, there's not much time for looking back. But that was all about to change. (phone ringing) Mrs. Mahoney's on line two. She needs the Disneyland itinerary for her family. - Yeah, sure. - [Betsy] You know it'll probably be different. - We were young. We made a deal, a promise. We even set a date. - By the way, your wife is on line five. - Oh, thanks. - Hi, sweetie. Again? The second time this month. Is she okay? (phone ringing) - [P.A.] Dr. McDermott, dial 2940 please. - Angela Kramer. Where's Angela Kramer? She's here somewhere. Look, j-just, just, just gimme the room number. What? - Kurt. They have her stabilized. But they want to keep an eye on her for a few days. It all happened so quickly. One minute she was fine, and the next minute she just stopped breathing. I tried to get her breathing. I tried. (crying) - Dad called this morning. - What a surprise. He talks to you more than I do. - He wanted to congratulate you. - No. - Yeah. - And he wanted to know if you were going to settle down and get a career now that you've broken the Guinness record for the longest time to finish a four-year degree. - Ha ha. That Marv, he's a funny guy. - He also wanted to know if Gene could take my place, since I can't go. - Gene, who hates me? Geno who every time I'm with him tells me what I should be doing with my life? No, thanks. - Honey. (chuckling) I love you. - Ha ha, you're just saying that. - Maybe, but I still do. - Well, I don't know why. You should have listened to your folks and not married such a loser. - But I wanted you. - Huh. Not sure how I should take that. Oh, marshmallows. Need 'em. - You know, you're gonna miss our anniversary. - Didn't I say I wouldn't let that day go by without saying, "I love you?" - [P.A.] Meat department, you have a call on line three, please. Meat, line three, customer service. - Geno on the river, huh? Do I have to bring him back? - [Pam] He's avoiding me. - Oh, no, no, no. He felt, he felt terrible. He felt really bad that he couldn't talk to you himself. - Tell him I found the paddle jacket he asked me to get. Took me four stores, but I found it. Okay, thanks. (phone ringing) Bye. - Where does all this stuff go? - On the boats. - Looks like a train wreck. - Seven days is a long time. You need a lot of gear to go out for that long. - Hey you, man. - [Stan] Hey. - Do this float? - Even with you in it, Gordito. - It's a good thing. I don't wanna be (speaking foreign language). - Wait a minute, what? - It's, it's mine. It's a launcher for water balloons and stuff. It's fun. - It's fun? - Yeah. - Lose it. It's not going. - He's a good kid. - He's more concerned about his slingshot than he is about helping out. - Hey, give him a break. He's your son. - [Andy] A third person takes this as far back as he can. It's really cool. - I don't know. - 300 feet. - No! - [Gwen] Try to get to know him. - Side of a football field. - You invited him here for some reason. (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) (contemplative music) (spokes ticking) - Are you sure it's the right thing to do, this trip? (thunder rumbling) - There's something back there, Maggie. I know this sounds crazy, but I feel like I lost part of me. I gotta go back and find out if I left it there. - [Nancy] She'll be okay. She's finally asleep. - How are you? You haven't slept in two days. - I'm fine. Kind of getting used to it, if it's possible to get used to this. - Every time the phone rings, I wonder if this is it. I'm not going. I can't leave you here alone. Who knows when it's gonna happen again. Maybe tomorrow, maybe next week. - You have to go. - It's okay. They'll understand. - She was awake on the way here. She wanted me to tell Daddy to have a way fun. - Right. I just can't leave you now. Not like this. - Go. Go for both of us. Get wet. Sit in the sand. Sleep under the stars. Go. Go.

It's a good opportunity to meet one another, put the names with the faces. So would you two like to start? - Well, we're Don and Gail Gordon. Call us Gooch and Gore. - And we're here because Kramer talked Gooch into coming here instead of Hawaii. - Nice going. - This is our first trip, too, so we're pretty excited. We're with Stan. I'm Gwen and this is Ernie. And this is Andrew. - Yeah, Ernie's my top drywaller and Andy's my um, well, I thought he could learn a couple of things on a trip like this. - You'll like him. It's nice to have a good-looking young man around. - Is Ernie your real name? - My given name is Guillermo Nenito Mosquera Cabrera. - Guillermo, you mind if I just call you Ernie? - [Ernie] Yeah, sure, okay. - Everybody, this would be my brother-in-law Geno. - It's just Gene. - Geno's here to try and straighten me out. - [Stan] Good luck. - And this is Geno's wife, Zorb. You'll like her. (rock music) (engine rumbling) (engine shuts off) - Welcome to Stiffs Anonymous Uncle Steve, how's it going, man? - Moocher, is that you? - In the flesh, dude. - [Steve] Well, pull up a rock. - [Moocher] All right. - Uncle Steve? - His sister's oldest. - You guys look like way organic here. - This must be Nate. - You broke the code, dude. - This is Moocher, Stan. - That's a rad hat, man. I'm gonna have to borrow that later. - All right, so where were we? - I'm Mike Stillman. I have a law practice in Chicago specializing in corporate litigation. And this is Pam Hayes. She works at a small design boutique. - Hi, everyone. Nice to meet you all. - You're an artist? - Graphic artist. We design artwork and illustrations for ads, brochures, special projects. - Is that everyone? - What about you guys? - [Stan] This is Kurt Kramer. - Now that you've heard it, forget the Kurt. - And here we have Steve Skinner. We're not exactly sure what he does when he's not on the river. (Gene clearing throat) Okay everyone, this is the deal. Just because we are doing the rowing doesn't mean we do all the work. This is a private trip where everyone helps out loading, unloading, cooking, cleaning, room with a view. - Especially that. - Room with a view? - Boater's friend. - Okay, we put in tomorrow so everyone get a good night's sleep. - Boatmen's meeting. - Hey, where are they going? (peaceful music) - [Kramer] As we looked out on the river that evening, I knew Nancy was right. I was here for a reason. I just wasn't sure what it was. - Give me some slack. - Hey, I'm about out of line. You ready to take it while we're still young here? - Okay, let me have it. (water splashing) - It's okay, Mikey. - What's the skinny on you and Pam? - I'm not sure. - Seems like something you should know. - Hopefully I will in a few days. Do you think I take things too seriously? - Well, she must. - We're missing a life jacket. I counted 'em. - [Stan] He's a little nervous. Okay, let's do an idiot check. We got everything? - All clear on the beach. - Are we about ready yet? - Just waiting on you. - (clearing throat) Ladies and gentlemen, let's go boating. (all cheering and applauding) - You uh, you think maybe a couple of you could get off and untie us? Maybe even give us a little push? (all chattering) - Chop, chop, chop, chop chop. - Excuse me. - I'll get it. - Whoa, whoa! It's freezing! - What, are you gonna stand there and complain, or you gonna get in? (Moocher laughing) - How's the water, (indistinct)? (gentle music) - Is this it? Just a big hole in the ground with a river at the bottom? - It says these walls are solid granite. - So? - We're in the Idaho Batholith. It's a vein of granite that runs across the whole state. - So? - So what? - So this is it? This is all? - Yes. - You know what I'm missing to be here? - Moocher. - I could be out with the dudes cruising State, but instead I'm in Barfo. - Batholith. - Whatever. I'm in a big hole with a bunch of deadheads. - Moocher. - What? - Shut up. - Hey, I never told you congratulations. Your graduation. - Surprised, huh? Yeah, me too. - [Gene] So what are you gonna do now? - You mean will I get a real job? - Yeah, any prospects? - One. Interview was good. They liked the resume. - I'm proud of you. So what company? Anybody I know? - Well, it's not for sure yet, but I guess Bone Out Bikers is looking for a good gear man in the shop. Good benefits. Nice discount on helmets and pads. (laughing) - It says here our first big rapid's up here around the next bend. - It's about time. - [Zorb] Hey, is it a good one? - Always. It's the first one.

To disassemble, extricate the seat, cork the tank (speaking foreign language) - [Kramer] (speaking foreign language) - [Mikey] Any questions? - [Gore] It's not very private. - In the event of close quarters, a tent will be provided. - That's for your privacy and our protection. - Oh, that's disgusting. - You'll get used to it. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. - Dismissed. (rock music) (body thudding) (guitar smacking) (Moocher breathing hard) - What are you looking at? (water rushing) - You know I've never done this before. - It's okay. Before I start, I never do it before either. - What do I do? - You take a piece of the worm like this, then you put the red one on the hook like this. Then the big one, she hit him. - I went fishing once. So bored I fell asleep standing. - Did you catch anything? - I didn't want any stupid fish. - It's called skunk. - What was that? - Skunk. When stupid fish are smarter than fisherman. Now drop it in the hole. - Okay. (reel clicking) - That's good. - Do I reel it in? - Some things you can't hurry. When you want it to work, you give it the time. When it's right, you'll know. And a big one, huh? - They won't catch nothing. - Probably not. - They look like they're having fun. Time sure goes fast. Sometimes I wish I had more say in the way things went. - Like what? - Like him. I mean, I wish I had more say in, in what goes on with him. - Well, you do have say about one thing.

(Steve cackling) - Yeah, I gotcha. (all chattering) - Make way for the throne! (all applauding) - [Steve] Flex 'em, babies. Flex 'em. (water splashing) - You know, if you'd waited a bit, you could have just handed it to him. - [Steve] Hey, nice throw, kid. Here, tie it low. Okay, ladies, what do we got? - [Mikey] Looks different. - [Kramer] Nah, you're looking through a lot older eyes. - Does this have a name? - House Rock. It's on the map. - I don't see any house rock. - It's underwater. - Then what is the big deal? - [Stan] You want to row through? - No. - Then shut up. - Okay look, everyone keeps telling me that. - Therefore? - [Mikey] What's this rated. - Three, maybe be four in this water. - Can you cheat it? - You can do anything you want. Just as long as you don't go anywhere near that hole on the bottom right. - Are you gonna get us wet? - You brought that here. - So the best run is left, right? - Right, left. - Okay, everybody clear on that? - Perfect. Just follow the skin man. - Oh, I'm the Guinea pig? - Nah, quit your whining. We get to the big stuff, we'll get Mikey to do it. He'll do anything. - [Steve] He likes anything. - Mikey! Okay, let's gear up. Gonna be a good one. (whistling) Come on, Dad. - [Mikey] Stop that. (water rushing) - Hey, you want me to show you a good way to coil that bow line? - Am I doing that wrong, too? - No, I just thought that maybe... Never mind. All right, let's move - [Zorb] All right! - Let's move! (optimistic music) (water roaring) (boaters shouting) (boaters whooping) (ominous music) - Get the spare! - I can't; it's stuck! - Just push the buckle on the strap. - It won't work! (suspenseful music) - Move over; I'll do it! - Michael! Michael! No! Michael! Are you okay? They pulled in over there. (breathing hard) - [Steve] Come on, big boy. - [Moocher] Bam! - Mikey the barnacle man. - We didn't do that right, did we? - Yeah, if only I'd had two oars to work with. - Boat made it, people made it, good run. - Mucho agua. - Cut it pretty tight in there, didn't you? - Got a good look at it. - Maybe a little too tight? - Don't worry about me. - I just think we oughta be careful. It's been a long time. - Hey, listen, don't tell me how to run. I know what I'm doing. I've never lost anybody. (rain pattering) (thunder rumbling) - I think we're on the edge of this. (thunder crashing) Come on, give us your best! Come on! (loud thunder crashing) Woo hoo! - Look at them. - [Steve] Now that's the mystery date. - You know, I don't get it. I mean, they don't talk. I-I-I think she likes him, but don't you think that's a little odd? I mean, why come on a trip like this? - River test. Get out there away from everything. No baggage, no expectations. - All of a sudden you're the expert. - Never said that. - So are we on your little test? - Doing remarkably well. - You know, we didn't come here to be graded by you. - Well that's good, 'cause it's pass/fail. (laughing) - That's fine. That's fine. Don't deal with it. Just laugh it off. - Gene, come on. Leave it alone. - No, no, it's, it's all right. I'll stop all this dancing around it. What's your problem? (thunder rumbling) - All right. Dad was right about you. You know, you're midway through your thirties and you've got nothing to show for it. No direction, no career. I don't know how Maggie puts up with it. You know, everything, everything's a joke to you. It's all a joke. This-this trip, school, your job. I came on this trip to try and give you some direction, but you don't want any help. - You promised me that you were not gonna do this- - I know, I know, I know. But somebody's gotta tell him something. - So how long is this gonna go on? - What? - How long are you gonna be mad so I can plan ahead? Get back to our regular dysfunctional relationship? - [Gene] It's hopeless. You're hopeless. - Okay, well, maybe I'm more honest with myself instead of just falling in line with Pop and stacking chairs at the Delroy store. Where your buck- - I will not sit here and have you make fun of what my family took years to build! - Fine! Jump off anytime. - You're a loser. Everybody knows it. Even your friends. - Aah, feels like lunch. Wanna have some lunch? Lunch. (birds singing) (boaters chattering) (Frisbee smacks) - [Gore] Where is it? (guitar chord) (hawk crying) (suspenseful music) (boaters shouting and cheering) (playful music) - [Kramer] Go, go, go, come on, come on! Pick it up, pick it up. (water splashing) (boaters applauding) - [Pam] Gonna make it? - [Kramer] Oh, he's okay. He's just upset. - [Stan] Upset? We won. (all shouting) We just need an unbiased scorekeeper. Gooch, where's your wife? - [Steve] Not her. I've got her pegged as a blocking back. - Everybody ready? Go! (all chattering) - Moocher! - And the race for the best campsite is on. I'm putting my money on Gore. - That's a good bet. Ho hum, another lousy day in paradise. - There you go, fellas. Stan, incoming. - [Stan] First things first. - This is the first thing. - Chain gang. Everybody, let's go. (clapping) Chop chop. - When you're finished over there, you can come over to my boat. - You guys haven't changed a bit. - Oh yes we have. I'm much fatter. Dr. Skinner is finally graduating. Mikey's still a fun guy. But you, you still haven't learned the fine art of relaxing. - Not when there's work to do. - See, you're in the hurry-up plan. Hurry up and unpack so we can hurry up and make dinner, so we can hurry up and clean up. - So we can hurry up and get to bed so we can get up the next morning and get an early start and hurry up through breakfast so we can hurry down the river to the next campsite. Here here. - (chuckling) You got me. Okay, toss me over a cold one. - Oh, yeah! - Thanks, baby. - Hey you guys, where's the bathroom? - It's not up yet. - What are you sitting around for? - I think Moocher should do it. - He did it the last two nights. - His personality fits the task. - [Kramer] And he's always willing to help out. - Anyone see the shovel? - Hey Mooch, would you mind setting up the room with a view? - No way, Pops. I did it last night. - Pops? - We thought you liked doing it. - It's bogus. Find some other sorry sucker. - You're the best sorry sucker we got. - Look, back off, man. You guys are always giving me the grunt work. Let someone else do it for a change. - [Stan] Who? - What about the queen poobah herself? She has all the frequent flyer miles. - [Mikey] Moocher, set it up. - [Moocher] I mean, this stinks. - Well, I'll take care of it myself. Get outta my way. - Ooh, now you've done it. - [Moocher] What? - I'd hustle my hiney up there and help out if I were you. - You ever seen him mad before? - All right, all right. Slave boy's on it. (water splashing) - Sorry about Gene today. He's a good man. He just thinks it's his job to be his father's son. (emotional music) - Geno told me I was hopeless today. He said my life was a joke. Maggie was crazy to stay married to me. - You think he's right? - No. - Me neither. - I never told Maggie the whole story. I think I was afraid that she'd be disappointed in me. I don't know what I'd do if she was. (Steve sighs) (Kramer chuckling) - No, it's nothing. It's, it's just that there's nothing to say. (frogs chirping) (birds singing) - Thank you. (snake rattling) He's been there all morning. - [Gene] What are you gonna do? - [Steve] Nothing. He doesn't wanna be near us anymore than we want him to.

I'll do it, okay- - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! I got it. (strap ripping) (Zorb screaming) (Gene splashing) (boaters cheering and applauding) I hate you guys. - [Steve] "Mother Goose."

I didn't come here to impress your pals. Not for the scenery, not to act out some part. I came to be with you. To see if we were good for each other. - We're going by an airstrip tomorrow. You can fly out there if you want. (bag thuds) - [Steve] Body slam! (body thudding) - I gotta tell you, Skin, your nephew's just a little bit out there. - Oh, he's harmless. Just a little pharmaceutically challenged. - He told me he knows the exact day he's gonna die. - It's not on this trip, is it? - She's going out tomorrow. - Nice guy, throwing his own girlfriend off the boat. - Why didn't you say something before? - She just couldn't be away from work for that long. Besides she, she hasn't been feeling well. - Maybe she's suffering from acute affection deficiency. AAD. So riddle me this. If you know the day you're gonna die, and you wake up in the morning, are you happy or disappointed? - Happy. - Disappointed. (rope creaking) (boaters chattering) - [Steve] Hey, fellas, we got a boat loose. - Hey, little help!

Makes you crazy. - Did you ever lose anybody? - Yeah, people fall out all the time, but you usually get 'em right back in. - He meant did we lose anybody. Didn't you, kid? Yeah, we lost a guy once. Kid we were training, Buck, short for Buckaroo. He was this Wyoming cowboy. Said he was the fastest fencer in the Cody Basin. He was always saying, "Yes, sir" before we even had a chance to tell him what to do. Seems like he was always making something for somebody. (fire crackling) (somber music) His first day on the water, he found this broken oar floating in an eddy. It was like a trophy. You'd think he'd won the national bull riding championship the way he hung onto that thing. Had us all carve our names in it. His dream was to have his own ranch someday. Said he was gonna name it The Broken Oar, hang that paddle above the gate. After that first trip, he had me talk to his folks on the phone. They said he was a little green, not quite saddle broke, but a good kid, hard worker. They asked me to watch after him. - Buck was with Skinner. We were coming to Lost Gorge. When Skinner jumped onto my boat to ask about a song. Told Buck to pull in around the next corner 'cause there was a rapid coming. When we came around the corner, he wasn't there. He decided to go on down, take a look, got caught in the current, and he was into it before he could get over. He wrapped his boat around this huge boulder in the middle. Skinner freaked. I got him close enough to jump onto the rock, and I pulled to the shore to help out. Stan pulled in behind me. Skinner got to the top of the rock. Buck wasn't there. I'll never forget the look in Skinner's eyes as he was trying to find Buck. Finally he caught a glimpse of something behind the rocks. Buck's foot had gotten wrapped in a coiled rope, which was sucked under this rock and pulled him in. Skinner grabbed his knife and dove in behind the rocks. After what seemed like a long time, two of them floated to the surface. When we finally caught up to them, Skinner was still sitting half in the water with Buck in his arms. Took personal responsibility for it. Not too many people know about that. I don't think I told Nancy until about three days after Angela was born. - Your little girl. - Our angel with a broken wing. She was born with MD, muscular dystrophy. - But you could have done something. Your OB should have run tests to make sure the fetus was normal. - Yeah, we knew there was a possibility of problems. Nancy and I made the decision to let the baby go full term and leave the rest to God. - Do you regret it? - I wish I could make her better. But regret that I had her? No. Just think of what I would've missed. - It's just such a tragedy. - Part of the reason we keep coming back here is, is that we don't know exactly what's gonna happen. That's part of the thrill. It's never the same river twice. You're preparing to do a Grand Canyon trip and you wake up on the Salmon. Instead of Lava Falls, it's Salmon Falls. instead of red rocks, it's gray. Instead of a little girl who runs and plays, you have an angel in a wheelchair struggling just to sit up. The river's out there, too, Mikey. Sometimes it's all you can do just to, just to keep a grip on the oars. Good night. - It wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be. Actually feel a little relieved to get it out. Feel like a midnight swim? - [Stan] You won't even go out in the sunlight. - You trying to talk me out of this? I may never have the desire to do this again. - He's right. This is a big moment. Generating a lot of positive energy here. Very good karma. (Stan laughing) - I thought this would be some kind of pep talk. - We're gonna die in there. We're gonna be impaled on a sharp rock. - I can't believe you're actually gonna do this. - Come on. Get it on. - Come on, baby. - Here we go. - Come on. - Here we go.

Talked about it in psych class. - I wear my boat coat because I don't want her thinking about nothing. Even if she want me. I wear this to let her know she can't have me. - The river can be pretty unforgiving. - That's why me and her, we got a thing. We don't get too close to each other. - Uh, listen up guys. We've been thinking about moving some of you folks over to Mike's boat because Pam's leaving. - She's decided to stay. - [Stan] All right. - No, actually, I asked her to stay. - Far out. - You know what, Skin Man? I've been thinking that maybe I oughta stick this out. - Sure you don't wanna change your mind? You may have to do the room with a view again. - No, no, I wanna stay. Babes will just have to wait. - Hey everybody, Moocher's staying. (laughing and whooping) Well, I'm happy you're staying. (birds singing) - This is the best part of the day. - When we were running the rapid the other day, House Rock, I think, you should know I can't swim. No one has to know about this. - What if you fall in? - Well, I'd go in after her. (ethereal music) (water rushing) (rapids roaring) - What's the plan? - You in a hurry? - I don't see much point standing here looking at it. - Looks like a hard right to me. - We gotta start right or ferry across. - [Steve] I'm gonna try to stay right the whole way. What do you think? Just don't wait too long. - Is he okay? (rapids roaring) - [Kramer] Who's going first? - Why don't we let trip leader decide? Okay, I'll go on this one. Maybe Ernie should go with you to even out the weight through there. - All right. - Okay with you, Stan? Stan. - Yeah, fine. Whatever. - It's okay with me. Me and the river, we got a thing. - You okay? - Come on guys, let's stop talking about it and just do it. - Okay. See you boys down there. - Untie us. - Whoo! Okay, Moocher, let's go boating. (suspenseful music) Yeah! (whooping) (water rushing) Okay, we've got a big hole coming. Hang on. Hang on! (boater grunting) Geno! Help me get the lead rope. - What are we doing? - I don't know. I just got a feeling. - We're pulling in? - He's pulling over! - Okay, Geno. Go! Got me, Geno? - Yeah. - Hold on. Moocher, you be ready for Mikey. - I'm coming in. - Catch him! - [Steve] Now! Got it? - Yeah, yeah, I got it. - Pull! Pull! All right, got it. - What are we stopping for? - I don't know. I just got a feeling. - Pulling pretty hard. - Geno, you got me? I need your best. - You're not going anywhere 'til you say so. (Gwen shrieking) (water crashing) - Good, perfect run. - Everybody all right? - [Steve] We're okay. Go on down. Wait for us at the bottom. Come on, Stan. He's too far left. (dramatic music) (water splashing) (boaters shouting) All right, Gene, when I yell, push us out towards the center. Straight towards the hole. You've gotta get us there. Mikey, you're gonna have to get out of the way. You go for boats, I'll go for people. Moocher, you be ready to let him go. - Pull Stan, pull! Come on! - Come on, Stan! - Pull, Stan! Pull! (Steve shouting) Power in; go ahead! No! (water splashing) Push! - [Pam] Got it! I got the rope! - [Steve] Now, Geno! Now! Okay, you're clear. (dramatic music) - [Stan] Andy! Andy! - [Zorb] There he is! - [Stan] Andy! - Heads up, Moocher! We only get one try at this. - [Stan] Grab the boat! - [Steve] He's right in front of us. Moocher! - [Moocher] Yeah, yeah. I got him. I got him. - [Steve] Get him by the jacket! - Grab me, Andy! Come on, I got you. - Pull him, man. (men grunting) - [Andy] Where's my dad? - [Steve] Get him in, Moocher! - Help me out, Geno. I got you, man. Pull it out. - [Gwen] Is he okay? - [Steve] If we don't get to that boat, we'll lost it in the rocks. (rapids roaring) (dramatic music) - Where's Gwen? - She's under the boat. We're gonna split the rock! - What do we do? - [Zorb] We're gonna hit it! (Steve grunting) - [Steve] We're not gonna make it. - Get outta the way! - Moocher, what are you doing? - Moocher, no! (suspenseful music) (rapids roaring) - [Steve] The boat's ours. We gotta help Moocher. - Gwen! - My leg's caught! Get it. - [Moocher] I can't get it. I can't get it. - Moocher! - I got it! - I got it! - I got it. - [Gwen] I can't go under! - Coming to you. Coming to you. - Deep water! - You see 'em? - [Kramer] Almost there! - Where are they? - I'm pulling you out. (Gwen crying) (water gurgling) Are you okay? Okay? - There they are! - [Steve] Moocher's got her! - [Ernie] Pull, you can do it! Pull, pull! - [Stan] Get 'em in the boat, Mikey! In the boat. In the boat, quick! Come on. - Grab his jacket. (all shouting) - You guys okay? - Are you okay? - Everybody okay? You're all right now. (water calms) - [Stan] Clear! No! (scream echoing) (tackle clanking) (boat splashing) Makes you feel pretty small. When I was in the water, I was so angry I put my hands up to make it stop. The funny thing is, for a second there, I actually thought it would make a difference. (Kramer whistling) Must be chicken night. - Black tie? - Full on. - Dinner's at seven. Don't be late. Wear your best dress. (whistling) - This was a good idea. - It should help take their mind off things. How'd you know? - Oh, everybody loves chicken. - Seriously, how'd you know to pull over? - You believe in inspiration? - When you hear voices? - Someone trying to tell you something. - Who's hearing voices? - It's just a feeling. Like something was wrong. - Yeah. Seems like that's the only voice I've heard much of lately. No, maybe it was intuition, but maybe it wasn't. Maybe we had ourselves a little miracle here today. Or maybe it's time to move on. Buck wasn't your fault. Once again, it was a terrible, terrible accident. And yes, he's dead. But today, today people are alive because something spoke to you and you were listening. It was like, it was like God needed a little extra help right then, right at that moment, and he knew he could count on you. - What are you guys supposed to be? - Kids. It's a style thing, Moocher. Just takes a little extra effort. - You look like a couple of dorks. - Therein lies the problem. You see a couple of dorks where others see an ordinary dinner becoming a celebration. - What are we celebrating? - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. What aren't we celebrating? - Nate, you did really good today. (sentimental music) (Ernie and Andy talking quietly) (boaters clapping) (boaters chattering) - [Kramer] For now, no one remembered what happened earlier that day. It didn't matter. This time was ours, a gift. And we all somehow knew that the feeling of this perfect moment was only for now, and that it would never come back to us again. (boaters chattering) - [Gwen] To the chef. - [All] To the chef. - [Gene] To the chef. (all applauding) - Secondly, as hard as this is to do, we need to recognize young Moocher, who gets the Johnny Weissmuller Award. (all laughing) (crickets chirping) - Hey. I just wanted you to know how, um, how sorry- (slap landing) - I don't want you to be sorry. I almost drowned today because you haven't had your head into what you're doing this whole trip. You're so busy feeling sorry for yourself. And what's worse is that you're taking it out on the boy. You just can't see it. Oh, Stan, get on with life. While you've still got the chance. (contemplative music) - Must be genetic. Same people are always late. - It's not genetic. It's learned behavior. - So unlearn it. - Can't. It's conditioned. It's virtually impossible to change years of the same behavioral habits and patterns just like that. - Last one down rides with me. - Hey, you guys! You guys! Wait! - I've never seen you move that fast. - Except for meals. (laughing) (bag thudding) - You know, we thought it might be good if Gwen moved to Mikey's boat for the rest of the trip. Even out the weight. Okay with you? - [Mikey] We'd love to have you. - You need any help? - Nope. Actually, I sure could use your help cinching this down. Saw you tying knots last night. You did great. - It's a beauty morning. Let's go boating. - [Steve] "Red Rubber Ball." - [Moocher] Cyrkle. - [Steve] How do you spell it? - [Moocher] What difference does it make? - [Steve] 'Cause you could have just read it off of some hits of the sixties tape. - [Moocher] So? - [Steve] So it wouldn't count. - [Moocher] Either know it or you don't. - [Steve] Well, if you knew it, you'd know how to spell it. - [Moocher] C-Y-R-K-L-E. - [Steve] You definitely stole it. - [Moocher] Attack! (boaters exclaiming) (water splashing) (boaters whooping) - [Ernie] Get your towel! - Oh ho, whoo! (whimsical music) - [Stan] I gotcha, I gotcha. (boaters gasping and laughing) - You scurvy dogs! We'll get you for this! - Now we got a whole boat of wetbacks. - Ha, did you see the look on Stan's face? Complete surprise. (box clanking) - You think you can make it work? You're gonna have to teach us. - We'll need something for a sling, like, like a bowl or a pouch. This will work great. (tomato splashing) - Was that a fish? - Hey, something in the water. Get it. - It's a, looks like a... (tomato thunking) - Oh. - Uh. - Where in the- (tomato smacking) Incoming! - Look out! (all shouting and laughing) (slingshot twanging) (slingshot twanging) - Ah! - Yes! (happy music) - Not the driver. - You can hang this on the wall when you get home. - [Zorb] Did it again. - Hey, huh? It was good. (boaters shouting and laughing) - Hey, you ever rowed? - I, I couldn't do it. - Sure you could; give it a try. Come on. - Yeah, you'll be a good boatsman. - Oh no, I'd probably just screw it up. - Oh, no, no, no, no. I'll help you. There you go. Here we go. - Never done anything like this before. - You got a good teacher, man. - Mom says you're one of the best. These oars are heavy. - You're doing fine. How's your mom? - What do you wanna know? - She happy? - Most of the time. (peaceful music) She's like anyone else. She has bad days, too. - You know why I stayed away? - I think so. I'm a lot better now. When I was little I thought you just didn't like me. - No. No. It's just that I was so caught up on how I was feeling, I really didn't consider anyone else. - Mom said you were pretty upset about how things worked out. She said you had a right to be, that it was her fault. - I just wanted things to be better for you. Different than what I had. My mom was always there, but I, I really don't think she had much use for me. - She probably hasn't slept since I came here. And the only reason she let me come was because it was you. - She's obviously done a great job raising you. Okay, now stay inside here. Pull hard. It's gonna be tight. Come on, pull hard. - Look, do you wanna do it? - No, no, no, no. You're doing great. You're doing great. You're doing great. Pull, pull. - [Kramer] Come on, Andy! - Hey, hey, come on. Pull, pull. pull. That's it. Pull hard. Keep pulling that way. Tight, hard, harder. Ernie, get ready to catch a line in. - [Kramer] Catch a line. Heads up! (float splashing) (Ernie and Stan splashing) (boaters laughing) - [Kramer] All right, all right, all right. (boaters chattering) - Hey, hey, what are you doing? I thought you and the river had a thing. - You can have her. We just had a falling out. - [Kramer] I got it, I got it. (Kramer and Stan laughing) (toilet clanking) - Let me get that for you guys tonight. - Was that Moocher? - I think so. (insect buzzing) (hand slapping) I want it to be a surprise. - Yeah, but 12 miles, it's crazy. - Sometimes it's okay to be a little crazy. - Anybody know the way to the room with a view? - Through the trees. - You can't miss it. - 12 miles; why? - Better go get my tent up before it gets dark. - Hey, son, now that you're a veteran boatsman, how would you like to sleep on the tarp with us? I mean, the stars promise to be beautiful tonight. (Steve whistling) (Steve chuckling) - Moocher, you did it! Big style points. (boaters applauding) - You awake? - Yep. - You believe in God? - Yep. - Recovery says you should give your addiction over to a higher power. This is it, isn't it? - Long time ago I was out with my dad on a night like tonight. Same million stars you're looking at. I asked him about the same question. He said, "Wonder at the creation and worship the creator." Tie it up good and tight, Moocher. You guys are gonna have to jump to another boat. - Wait a second, I'm going with you. - Why? - I have my reasons. - Well, you were the one that was trying to talk him out of going- - I know, I know. - You don't have to do this. If you're going for me, I'm okay. I'll be fine. - I'm going for me. I wanna do this. - Let's go. (boaters chattering) - This is one crazy trip. (determined music) (birds singing) (water rushing) Happy anniversary. I love you. You didn't really think I'd let this day get by without telling you. I miss you, too. I love you. (receiver clacking) - I think you're making it sound worse than it is. - I'm not. Lost Gorge is the big one. - Compare it to something. - It's like Devil's Teeth, only bigger. Like the other day. - I'm sure it'll be fine. - Is this the one? Is this the one where the trainee- - [Steve] Hey, you guys. What's for dinner? - Hey. - [Steve] Mind if we join you? - Just in time. - Here we go. You boys must've flown. - It's Geno. He's an animal. Just down there a few turns. - Yeah, they've been talking about it. - Everybody okay? - Oh, I think things are gonna be a little tense around here for the next 24 hours. - And what about you? How you doing? - I've been there before. - Yes, you have, but you always keep getting back up. ♪ Amazing grace how sweet the sound ♪ ♪ That saved a wretch like me ♪ ♪ I once was lost ♪ ♪ But now am found ♪ ♪ Was blind but now I see ♪ - I wasn't sure before why I went today, but now I know. I want you to know it was worth running 12 miles to tell you I still love you. (guitar playing "Amazing Grace") - Oh, yeah! No more skunks. (laughing) (blue jay calling) (water murmuring) (Gene clearing throat) - Well, was it worth it? You passed. The river test. (birds singing) (boaters snoring quietly) - Steamroller! (men shouting and laughing) (Moocher exclaiming) - Oh, man. I liked you better before. - Morning. (rapids roaring) - You're trip leader. How do you want to do this? - I should go first. Then Kramer. You boys follow him. Take care of each other. - Make us proud. Show us how it's done. - Let's go. (water rippling) - Okay everybody, this is the real thing. Down in center right about a quarter of the way down is a huge rock. Once we clear it, you gotta cut back hard right. Stay out of the middle. - Why? What's down the middle? - Don't worry, you'll see. You don't want to get anywhere near it. - I'd like to run this with my own crew. Permission to board? - Granted. - Welcome back. Let's get wet. - Okay my boy. Why don't you give us a big shove? We got a date with the gorge. (optimistic music) (boaters whooping and laughing) - All right! - Okay kids, hang on. - Yeah! - Coming through. (boaters chattering) - Yee haw! - Yippee! (boaters whooping) (Gore screaming) (rapids roaring) - Pull, Stan! You can do it! - You can do it, boy, come on! - Come on, Stan! - [Andy] Come on, Dad! All right, yeah! We did it! (dramatic music) - We're coming in too steep! We're gonna hit it! High side, go, go, go! (water crashing) - [Gooch] Oh, man! (Gore screaming) (intense music) - [Gwen] Kramer's lost Gooch and Gore! (Gore screaming) - Hang on! - Man in the water. We gotta go get him. - Whoo, come on, Stan! We're losing him! Grab him quick! (boaters shouting) - Missed him! Closer. - You can make it, Stan! - Almost there! - Come on, Dad! - As soon as you get him, let me know. I still might be able to miss it. Little closer. You got him? - [Andy] I got him. - [Stan] Hold on tight. - We got him! We got him! - [Stan] Okay, hang on. (waves crashing) (peaceful music) (boaters whooping) - You did way good, boss man. (Gwen laughing in relief) - Great run, Dad. That was awesome. - [Gwen] Nice job, river man. (boaters laughing) - Thanks for waiting for me. - [Steve] You betcha. - Nice lead there, Stanley. - Thanks. - You were in vintage form, my friend. - My knuckles are still white. - Is this great, or what? - Yeah! (boaters whooping) - Stan. Thanks, buddy. - I love this life! (laughing) (oars splashing) - Won't be long. Just got an old friend we gotta visit quick. (poignant music) - [Kramer] We stood there a long time. Not much said. It was a quiet spot. We'd chosen it well. It was at that moment that I understood why I was there. When I looked at that oar, those rough, carved letters, I realized I'd lost someone here, too. Someone I cared a great deal about. I'd tried to step away. Think it was Skinner alone who carried the hurt, but there was my name. I'd put it there, and I'd tried to forget because I couldn't bear the thought of losing someone I loved again. I'm gonna lose her. I'm gonna lose Angela. (crying) - Every cowboy needs a bandana. - [Kramer] As I looked at that bandana, I wondered if we had given Angela what she needed. We had cared for her, held her in our arms, tied countless ribbons in our angel's hair. We loved her. That's why I needed to come. That's what I needed to learn: to remember to love the people you love as much as you can while you can. That was the legacy of Broken Oar Ranch. I think Buck said it best: "friends always welcome." - You take care, greenhorn. You'll do just fine. Yes siree. You'll do just fine. (majestic music) (birds singing) - So is this the takeout? - Almost. Split Creek bridge. Just a road accesses to the backcountry. Only thing we ever used it for was a Split Creek ambush. (peaceful music) - Where's Skinner? - [Together] Where's Skinner? - Where is he? (boaters shouting) - Hit the deck! (all shouting, laughing, and whooping) (water splashing) - [Kramer] Come on, come on, come on! - Need a towel there, baby? (Skinner clapping) - Gotcha! - [Steve] Nice.
