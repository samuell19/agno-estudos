[waves crashing] [jazz music] Whisper Naked Shadow Be Right There [phone ringing] DJ King Harvey is here! Prepare to die! Oh man! You should have been there! I tell you all the time. You only need to show up. If you know the DJ, you're halfway done. It was like one non-stop beauty pageant. I'm not gonna tell you all the details. Just two words, Robin: Sodom and Gomorrah! You know what you could have been doing? The Sodom and maybe even the Gomorrah. Oh man, it was like... ...the hell is going on there? You've got someone walking there naked? And you keep that to yourself? Come on, say something. Tell her to turn around. Come on, tell her to turn around. Turn around! What's with all the yelling so early in the morning? What's going on? I don't know, they're skyping loud as hell. Anyway, I'm having breakfast and I'm out. Uhm okay. And are you gonna put any clothes on? What? I mean, are you going to wear anything at all? Well, yeah, of course I'm not going out in this robe. Uhm, is she sleepwalking or something? - Are you okay? - Why? Why shouldn't I be? YOU'RE NAKED WHAT THE... Shut up! How are you doing that? [woman screams] [woman screams] What's happening over there? [Vicky crying] Vicky, what's the matter? [Vicky coughs] What was that? - Help! - HOW CAN I HELP YOU? Please! Whisper! - Like this? Is it better? - And you, put some clothes on. But I am wearing clothes... [woman screams] Are you okay? Please don't say anything. My head's already about to explode. I don't know. I don't fucking know. But it feels like being strangled by my own shadow. Some shadow demon. It's messed up. And don't touch me! What do you see? What am I wearing? Nothing. Yeah, no. I am wearing three shirts and a skirt. Come on, feel it! That's not possible! Which one of you is doing it? 24 hours earlier You couldn't land on Mars with that... Yeah I could. On a minor planet or a comet, maybe. And on Mars too. Come on, the spikes would be shaved off clean during the first landing. Not if they were made of something pliable enough. Engineering-wise, it would be way more fun than Philae. Right, but if you don't know the exact landing site, it will land in the shadow. Like Philae. Then what? A rover? Exactly. What you save on the landing mechanism, you can invest in the rover. And the rover finds a place in sunlight. Maybe. But the spikes would have to be like at least hundreds of feet and very light and... So, Mr. Bentley is out. The inside of the car was, like, gross. And to think I let him touch them... Who knows where those hands had been. I'm talking to Lea, you see... Oh! My apologies. Please, science away. Thanks. Oh, and behave yourselves, okay? We're just talking about landing a hedgehog on Mars. Why do I even bother? So, anyway, that's just crazy, of course. 'Sup, Vickster. What you doing? Studying. The InfoSys Theory exam is in two days... ...and if I fail it this time, they'll expel me. Hm, that sucks. So, I went out with Mr. Bentley. And I don't think he's gonna get some. Hmm, someone else will. Please, I really need to study. But someone else will not own a Bentley. Shouldn't you be studying too? Do you not have any exams coming up? I mean, I do. But not until next week, so let's not get ahead of ourselves. Also, Finance Law is a bummer. I just can't bring myself to it. I wish I had your cool. Try leaving your room, like once. The cool is out there. I just feel like there's no chance I can pass it. I just sit here all day like an idiot. Your words... I can't take this class again. Or the semester. If I fail it again... ....I'll kill myself. It'll be fine, you just have to clear your mind once in a while. So let's go out this weekend and maybe you'll meet someone. I only want to meet my graduate diploma. Here we go again... You know, maybe Robin could help you with the "info systems". Just ask him when he's done talking to that "hedgehog". What "hedgehog"? Eh, you wouldn't understand. It's a scientific conundrum. Something with Mars. [phone rings] Oooh, he's texting me! He says he will clean the car. For me. And he also sent a poem... ...about my thigh gap!? Ugh, what a pig. But the car is great... ...but filthy though. Why would you even try the hedgehog thing? You don't need any fuel, so you don't have to control the descent in the first phase. And then it crashes into a mountain and breaks apart. Present time That's not possible! Which one of you is doing it? I'm definitely not doing anything. It's just that my clothes seem to be invisible. Try my clothes. Here you go. What's happening to us? I don't know. But my own shadow, or something like that, just tried to kill me. - That's nonsense. - Is it? So I have gone crazy or what? Go ahead, shine some light on me! You see? Nothing. But what about me? I'm naked no matter what. Or...am I not? Well, there you go. One of us is dreaming or has gone crazy. Or it's someone from the outside. Some secret government project! NO THAT'S... - Ow! Ow! Turn off the light! The hell are you doing with your hand? I'm not doing it. It's not me. What do you mean it's not you? I don't know, just don't turn on the light. [phone rings] Whisper! Hey, Harvey. I can't... Are you okay? What happened? The orgy went wrong? Should I come over to help you out? No, no, no, no, no. Okay, so what's going on? Nothing's going on. It's just that Robin must whisper, Vicky's own shadow is trying to kill her and I'm naked no matter what! Awesome! I'll be right there! Whisper Naked Shadow 30 days earlier Excuse me, could you take a picture of me in front of this building? - I'm a student here. - Oh, really? I used to be one too. Some time ago.... You don't say.... ...and would you like to talk about it? Over dinner, maybe? Come on, I could be your dad. Plus.... And eat something! Heads up, Dominator! Present time [doorbell] So what's going on? I can't speak. So I hear. Probably just an infection. But Sofie is naked no matter what. Which is not such a tragedy, if you ask me. You don't get it. Not my first time, or the last. Where is she? I'll calm her down. She doesn't want anyone to go in. What's that? Just stay by the door. - Leave me alone! - It's me. Can I come in? Don't even think about it. Come on, I've already seen you naked. Accidentally, a year ago, and I don't want to remember it, so it doesn't count. I want to remember it and I do. And it was great. So, come on, let me in. Maybe I can help. Doubt that. So what exactly do you mean by "naked no matter what"? This... Take off your jacket and give it to me. Yep... Shit! Oh, wow! How did you do it? She has no idea. It's driving me nuts! Come on, don't cry. It's not that bad. How am I supposed to live like that? I can't go anywhere naked. [speaking through the phone]: I have an idea. - See? He's got an idea. I'll call Lea. No, don't call her! She'll think of something. So will I. I'm an expert on nudity. We'll figure it out. Where's Vicky anyway? She refuses to leave her room. She says something is trying to strangle her. She tried to leave the apartment and came right back even more upset. I'll check on her. Behave yourselves! Did you find anything? Just a bunch of schizophreniacs. - I'm sure that's not it. - Or maybe it is. Maybe they're going through the exact same thing. Can you think of any explanation? No. Let's call a doctor? Or an exorcist? No. I'll call Lea. Okay. We can use another STEM person. Then we'll just work from there. What about Sofie? Still naked no matter what. What's happening to us, Robin? Come out. I've already seen you. I'm not gonna walk around here naked. So, we'll turn off the lights. Maybe I'm just dreaming. Right, then you can come out. But what are you doing in my dreams? I beg your pardon? Although, if this is just somebody's dream it's definitely mine. Don't tell anyone! Of course. Say something just so I know what it's like. SOMETHING Wowsers. And you can't control it? Maybe some kind of vocal chord infection? That's exactly what I said. And Vicky? And Sofie? That's also a vocal chord infection? Where are they anyway? In their rooms. Both scared to death. So, assuming you're not making fun of me, it's time for scientific inquiry, am I right? Let's inquire into Sofie's nudity first! Will you come over? I'll put my face on and will be right there! So what should we start with? Nudity. Should I take my clothes off too? Just so that you're more comfortable. Please don't. One nudist is more than enough, right? Just nobody turn on the lights, ok? Yes. Robin, can you please dim down the screen? Yeah. What if you whisper instead of typing it out? At your risk. Ok, just please shut it down completely. What kinds of things have you already tried putting on Sofie? - Clothes, aluminum foil... - ...paper, plastic wraps. - And? Nothing? - Nope. What were you doing yesterday? Or right before it happened? Nothing special. I went out for a drink ...or ten, you know. But everything was business as usual. I was here. Studying. I was coding. What exactly were you coding? The chess app. Does it even matter what exactly it was? Yes, it does. What if what's happening now is exactly what he coded yesterday? That sound crazy stupid. And what doesn't sound crazy stupid right now!? Mass hysteria... I'm seeing a doctor tomorrow morning. So we'll see if it's real or not. But what am I supposed to do? I'm still naked and I can't go anywhere like this. - Hedgehog in the cage! - Come again? - What? - What are you talking about? Well, you are a hedgehog. All we have to do is build a cage for you. And one for you too! What cage? A light cage that would eliminate your shadow. And we can build a visual barrier around Sofie until we figure out what's causing it. It solves your nudity problem. Hmm, I was hoping you could use your superpowers for something. - I just want to survive it. - And I want to wake up. Ow! Godammit! Nobody's sleeping. We're all awake. And we're building a cage. Buh-bye, paw paw 3 months earlier text messages flirty messages from "Mr.Bentley" flirty messages from "Mr. Fiat" romantic poem from "Mr. Public Transportation" messages from "Mr. Jaguar" Did you like your new blouse? Almost as soft as you. Look where I am now. Should I pick something for you? Where are you? What are you doing, beautiful Ms Sophia? [music] [music] [music] [music] [girl screams] Present time Nobody's sleeping. We're all awake. And we're building a cage. Harvey, can you get something for us? Yeah. - Like right now? - Yes, right now. Go to Costco. I'll text you the list. They're closing in 30 minutes. Can you make it? I'm basically already there. -And the girls? -They're in their rooms. I thought we could.... Let me change to my work clothes. [dramatic music] [dramatic music] [dramatic music] Ready. Great. [uptempo music] If we hang this above Vicky's head, she won't be able to turn her head and it'll strain her neck. Maybe if she had like a collar with wires sticking out of it like spokes. Still too high. Let's put a hoop down here, so it gets her butt too. Yeah, but it will compromise weight and battery life. She'll need spare batteries in a fanny pack. Nooo, not a fanny pack. Fanny packs are lame. Why? They're practical. I don't get why people hate them. If she has to look like a burned down medieval ruin, at least let her have an elegant purse. But it will cast a shadow and get caught in the wiring. We need to be practical, not elegant. Plus, Vicky wears a unicorn jumpsuit Maybe she's not that into elegance. Hold this. Ok, a backpack then. Yeah, a pink one, so it matches the jumpsuit, huh? Yeah, it would get entangled with the wires too anyway. Ok, the fanny pack, then... Fanny pack shoots and scores again! Backpack and purse get knocked out cold! I'm going to text Harvey the shopping list and you can think of something for Sofia. [uptempo music] [laughing] [Robin speaks] [laughing] Stop laughing, morons! Can anyone think of anything better? I know, I'm sorry. But you should see yourself. You look like an obese ninja. No, sorry, I meant... ...a ninja with above average BMI. I hate you all! We're sorry, we shouldn't laugh. Please, come back. No way! Your mom's calling. It's the hospital, dammit. Give it! The hospital? She had another episode. Sofie found a place for her in an Alzheimer care facility. It's that bad, huh? Seems so. The last time she broke her arm running away from "the Nazis". I need to pick her up tomorrow from the hospital and take her to the home. How am I supposed to do that? Can't someone else pick her up? No. You have to sign papers and they know who I am. And does it have to be tomorrow? They don't have a bed for her anymore. They had already told me, but I forgot because of...this. What about your cousin? Can't she pick her up? Emma? Yeah, her. You have the same last name, don't you? Uh-huh. Harvey? Can we use your car tomorrow? Yes. So, let's meet up here in the morning. Call Emma too. We're going to need both of you. Thanks. I'm going to bed, I'm feeling half dead. Me too. Night. Want a ride home? [slow music] [slow music] [slow music] So, I'll pick up your mom for you? No, you can't. But you could sign her up in the new home. You have the same last name, so you can tell them you're her daughter. Yeah, I can do that. And if mom makes any problems, you can tell them she's having an episode. Listen... ...can I try like a ritual spell on you? I'm beyond caring... Ok, close your eyes now. So...? So nothing. No spirit of a burned witch trapped inside of you. Wow, what a relief... So, we can go now? Asking if that's what you're wearing would be a little gauche, right? [slow music] [engine starts] [phone rings] Hi, paw paw. Yes, yes, I sent out some CVs... ...no, please don't tell mom. Thanks. Yes, everything is, you know, fine. Alright. Buh-bye, paw paw. [ominous music] [Vicky screams and cries] Let's shine a light on it Good morning Ms Francova, don't you think it's quite odd to release a patient in this manner? I am terribly sorry. We're really in a rush. I appreciate your understanding of our situation and... ...and do I need to sign anything? No, that's alright. Your mother has some spare clothes in her bag, you know. Are we all taking our clothes off? Jesus, mom, no! That's just me. I see, you always have to be special, don't you, John? So...off we go? - Are you alright? Yeah, yeah, just turn off the lights. How are you? Good. They are taking her to the new home. Last New Year's Eve - Ok, so I'm.... - Could you , please, knock first, like once in your life, please? Sheesh, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were sleeping. Why are you sleeping anyway? At 3 pm? What? Is that not allowed? I mean...whatever. Do you maybe want to go to the NYE party with me? There's still time for a makeover. Time for what? Well, I would start with ditching the jumpsuit, combing your hair washing your face and then we'll see. I don't feel like going anywhere. Come on, give it a chance. Robin's out of town and don't tell me you want to be all alone on a NYE. I hate New Year's Eve. That's because you've never had a good one. Come on, get up! Harvey is spinning at some posh party. He can get us in. And then what? Well, there will be plenty of eligible bachelors there. Yeah, can't wait... Or I can get you a male company to begin with. How about Adam? He is nice. A total teddy bear. He'll be over the moon if you let him cop a feel and will pay for everything. And will just stare at you devotedly. Absolutely not. Ok, no feels will be copped. Mr. Architect! Divorced and bored. But also too prominent to just grab people. So he's just gonna stare and pay. So what would he get out of it? He's 55 and you're 25. So...that. Hmm, I could as well go with my paw paw, then. Not at all the same thing. At least paw paw is fun. But he puts on earplugs and goes to bed at 8. He hates New Year's. I see, it runs in the family. Patrick! A country boy born and bred, he's like 24, but he made it big in IT. What am I supposed to do with him? He's shy, so not much really. He's not gonna grab or stare, he is just gonna... ...pay for everything. Exactly! Take it off, for crying out loud. And put this on. I don't know. Isn't it too much? We don't even know each other. That's how you'll get to know each other. Here, let me see. [uptempo music] [uptempo music] [uptempo music] [uptempo music] [uptempo music] Are you crazy? I'm not going anywhere. Well, I'll party for the both of us then. And you stay home. I'll pop a pill and sleep through it. Like paw paw. Exactly. Like paw paw. Look, it's getting really sad. You haven't left your room in a week. Aren't you gonna slit your wrists or something? Don't worry. I'll be fine. Sherlock and I will have a great time. Ok then...a happy new year to you in case I don't see you before you black out. I think that's more of your style. Seriously though, thanks. Have fun. And say hi to all the Adams... ....and architects and country boys. Maybe next time I'll come with you. Yeah, maybe. [knocking on door] Come in. Last summer Hey, man! I'm so happy to see you again. Y'know, I don't know what I'm gonna do when I can't stay in the orphanage anymore. Come see me in Prague. I'll introduce you to some people. Show you the ropes, maybe we'll get you a job. That would be great. I had sent out some CVs, but... ...nobody called back. Yeah. It's a shame Aunt Hanka is no longer with us. She was the best. She helped me get my first job when I had to leave the home. I liked her a lot too. She even got me my first video game. Hot Summer. Honza Majer forever! I think I played the same copy! That's a good one. - I'm really into Spacechem now.... - Watch out for the darkies! I like the score comparisons and that it's not your typical puzzle with just one solution. "Watch out for the darkies ? Did I hear that right? Are you serious? "Watch out for the darkies"? You see two Gypsies and you have to keep your distance and clutch your purse like it's your newborn baby? That's just so typical. No asking, no thinking, just discriminating, purse clutching and spreading racism, huh? Robin? Robin? Are you listening to me? Have you played Spacechem? Come on, Cathy, let's go before the minorities get out of hand. Wow, are you hearing this? Shouldn't we tell them something? Nah, what's the point. You're better off if you just... keep your head down, and stay quiet. I'm going to see the doctor. Are you going to be ok in the meanwhile? I'll be back soon. Let's at least try to call them. Agreed. I love movies about exorcism and demons. Have you seen Hereditary? Awesome, right? The severed head... ...buuut, I'm sure this is different. There's a logical explanation. Scientific. Whatever. But why not ask them? He's not wrong, though. Let's rule out the unscientific ones first. Robin suggested exorcists too. Where did you find these? I couldn't sleep, so I googled around and these have the best customer rating. God...exorcists with the best rating, sounds odd enough. Exactly. No, it sounds awesome! I'm a little scared though. Of what? The exorcism. Nothing to be scared of. There's no devil or god, so I don't know why even do it. So your clothes being invisible, that's because...? I still think I'm dreaming. So, we're all dreaming? Like in Inception? How would that even work? That's impossible. So let's rule out the impossible. As Sherlock Holmes says: Once you eliminate ...the impossible... ...whatever remains, must be the truth... ...no matter how improbable. Great. So, should I call them? Why don't we call someone from here? I thought it would be safer this way. Everything gets around really quickly here. And you don't want journalists camping outside your house and taking pictures, do you? No, definitely not! And these two claim to be 100% discreet plus it's a priest and a psychologist. That's an ideal combo, right? So, you think someone here has gone crazy? No, because if you have, then so have I and that's out of the question. I'm just saying it's a good combo. What do they charge? First session is free. So shall we? Let's just see what they have to say for now. I don't even care anymore. Go ahead. - Hello there! - Hi. Hello. Thank you for taking our call. Oh, no problem, we’re here for you and we’ll do all that we can to help you. And remember, we believe you. Great, they believe us. That's a good start. That’s great, we also wanted to make sure this conversation stays just between us. - Of course. - Absolutely. As a clergy, I take the confessional privilege very seriously. Whatever you show us, stays with us. Sounds good, so, where do we start? Why don’t you tell us a little bit about what seems to be the trouble. And we can see if exorcism is really the right way to go, and it may no be. So should we show them? I'm not showing them anything. Not on camera, are you crazy? Let's wait up for Robin anyway. It's quite complicated actually. Then let's shine a light on it. [ominous music] Gone Usually when we turn the light on... [girl screaming] What happened? - Did the ghost snatch her or something? - Well, actually... - It did. - Yeah. It seems to happen every time there is a source of light on her. What the hell is going on!? Can we pick this up another time, if you don't mind. Let us know when it’s good for you. We will be here. Will do. Vicky-boo, are you ok? What the hell were you thinking? That was my idea. -A dumb one, for sure. - Yeah, it was. We shouldn't have let her do it. Come here... Guys, could you give us a moment? -You want us to go? -Just for a minute. Let me just take this to kill some time with. What are we gonna do now? Go to my place and play Duke? Are you still here? Can you get us something to eat? Feeling better? Food! Stress makes people hungry. Coconut flavor. Heads up, Dominator! How about hazelnut? Real food. Like pizza. But you can leave the hazelnut cookie here. Shouldn't we call your mom? Shouldn't we call your mom? Fair enough. No mom calling. Mom! Why are you such a control freak? "I've been thinking, we could..." ...no that sounds dumb. You just gotta go for it. "How about a movie, Vicky? Just you and I, as more than friends." No! That's even dumber. Don't say "more than friends". That's exactly what guys, who will always be just friends, say. How about this: "Vicky, would you like to go out with me?" What's up? Nothing, I was just thinking... ...would you like to... ...take out with me? Huh? I mean do you want any take out? I am going shopping. I can bring you something, if you want? Not really. Thanks, though. Did you say you're going shopping? Yeah... Could you get a few things for me, please? Yeah, sure. Alright, check your phone. list of groceries So, what did the doctor tell you? That he is out on vacation. Heh, that sucks. What now? You'll go there next week, no biggie. I have an exam tomorrow, that is a biggie. Can you not postpone it one more time? Maybe, but I won't know until later. Well, there ya go. I'm done with exams this semester, but I have work tomorrow. Then just go to work. Put on a scarf and tell them you're sick. Oh yeah, I'm here to fix your computer, but I'm totally not acting or looking weird or anything. Anybody can be sick. Yes. But some people are already weird when they should let me in their home. I am free tomorrow, I can come with you. What? I can smile. And if that doesn't work, I'll take care of the racists another way. Like what? Like this? I should come along. You two would be useless without me. Excuse me!? Ex-fucking-cuse me!? What about the exorcists, though? I don't want to show them anything anymore. I should hope so. We'll explain it to them tomorrow. Right, Lea? Like....this? Uhh, sure. We'll just describe the situation and see what's what. Hmm, and I'm going to sit here another whole day. Like an idiot. You can go out in that...hoop. I'm not going anywhere in that burqa. I would get stoned to death. Technically, it's not a burqa. More like a chador. Or is it a niqab? What? Well, we can see your face and... ...whatever, it doesn't matter. Right. At least you won't be alone. Vicky will be here with you. Yeah, in the dark. That doesn't drive me crazy at all. Look, relax. It'll sort itself out soon, I'm sure. [whispering]: Hail to the king. [laughs] You wouldn't understand. Yeah, right. It's some sort of... ...science-schmience conundrum. [slow music] [slow music] Hi there. - Tim and I are happy to see you again. And remembre, we are here for you And we believe you. That’s good, and Dj Harvey is here so prepare to - Cry. Prepare to cry. - Sorry, it’s just Harvey being silly. - Glad to see you guys are in a good mood. So, what’s going on.? Basically, it’s like this. [uptempo music] - I see, and it all started a few days ago. - Yes. And before that everything was normal? - Mhmm. So, is it? Is it a demon possession, or the devil, or something like that? Well, we can’t know at this point. - How do we find out? - And, can we find out like this? Well, let's see, you know, A true demonic possession is very rare. Right? - Right, extremely. Most of the time, things like this turn out to be, you know, Some kind of psychological imbalance or a paranormal occurrence. Tell me, Are your friends changing their behaviour in any way? What do you mean? You mean like... masturbating with a cross or something like that? Uh... No, I meant more like... Have they started doing something clearly threatening? Do they exhibit any signs of wanting to cause pain or dread? Uhm... No. No. Not at all. - Not more than usual. -What? -Sofie can be kind of a bitch. They asked about changes in behavior. - No, they are not changing like that. Well, that's good. So, what does it mean? We can’t know for sure, usually demonic possession manifests itself by clearly negative behaviours, aimed to cause pain. and dread. So, what could it be, then? Mary... - Well, any sort of paranormal activity. - What are those? It can be connected to a various range of issues. We haven't seen anything like you describe yet. Have we father? No. We have not, Mary. But the fact that it's a different power or rather curse for each of them, that certainly means something. So... Why don't you start by looking how the curse relates to them. To each of the individuals. Well... Huh, interesting idea. Yeah, I was like totally hammered the other day too. Wow, not only it pretends it can read, but that it goes to college too. Are you ...normal? Normal? Holy shit, Holy shit! I can speak like a normal person! Are you hearing it!? One, two, three. One, two, three. But you're not normal people, are you? [singing The Gypsy Baron] Sofie! Can you hear it? I speak normally! I don't know what happened, but... Robin, I'm worried about Vicky. What? What happened? She's gone. When was the last time you saw her? Yesterday, before I went to bed. Same as everyone else. I tried calling her like a hundred times. Nothing. And Harvey? Or Lea? No, they don't know anything either. - What about her parents? - I don't have their number. Do you? I don't want to alarm them. Maybe she just went for a walk and now she's hiding and waiting for the sun to go down. Maybe. Or maybe not. Maybe she went to school for the exam? I called the school, she didn't show up. What if she doesn't just come back? Let's try to get her parents' number. How?! Through the school. They must have emergency contact for her family. They won't tell us. Maybe they will. No harm in trying. Okay. By the way, how come you can speak normally? I have no idea. And me? Still... ...nothing, right? Hello, this is Sofie Francova again, Could you give me Ms. Viravska's emergency contact number, please? I'm her roommate and this is kind of an emergency. Tell her it's about school. Is it really not possible? Then how about you call that number and tell them to call me? dictates the telephone number Sofie Francova. Thank you so much. They'll call her family and tell them to call me. [phone ringing] Majer speaking. Yes. Uh-huh. Yes, I do. I'll call. Thank you. Bye. That was... Yeah, the school. She gave them my number. [slow music] - Ok, we’ll talk to them and report back. - Le us know. Stay strong for your friends. - Bye. It's getting more and more complicated, huh? Especially now that the hedgehog is out of the cage. We'll un-complicate it. I'm an expert on complications. Yeah, I hear that. That's Robin. Sofie... Hey. / What's up? Wow. / Really? Sure thing. / Of course. We'll be there / Leaving right now talking over each other incomprehensibly - Okay, you first. - I'll go first. Robin is Vicky's emergency contact. I know. And Robin can speak normally. I know that too. So shall we go? I mean, I'm supposed to meet my dad now. Can't you reschedule? He would not like that. He's back from Vienna after a month and he's only staying one day. So bring him along? He's a lawyer, right? He is. Something's telling me we could use him. Hmm. Out-lawyering a demon? It's fighting fire with fire, but what you gonna do. [slow music] [slow music] [slow music] [postcard from Vicky's grandpa wishing her luck with exams] Is mom ok? All good. Nobody checked if I'm her daughter. - Thanks a lot. - Thanks a lot. - You're welcome. Hi. - Hi, I'm Petr Kral. - Nice to meet you. Junior's telling me one of you needs a lawyer? And I think I know who. Did the young lady run into problems taking half naked pictures of herself in public? I was not half naked! Withdrawn, your honor. You know each other?! - Yeah. - No! Oh my god! Dad! Come on, nothing like that. I ran into her once. I don't even know her name. Sofie. Would anyone like a drink? - I would. - Me too. I thought we could consult with an... ...adult. And dad's a lawyer, right. You knocked her up... - Oh my god, no. - Excuse me? The both of you? Nobody is pregnant here. But you could help us start a search for a missing person. I knew we could use a lawyer. How long has the person been missing and what's their age? Since last night and she's 25. The cops won't go crazy for that at the moment. Do you have a reason to worry for her safety? - Well kind of.... - Yes. Okay... ...well... ...I'm all ears. [uptempo music] The exorcists said what? That it's not a demonic possession. Just parapsycho... ...something. Paranormal phenomenon. And do you have her family member's number? No. Did you try to look at the places she likes or usually goes to? Yes, her bed. She hardly ever leaves it. But she's not there. She doesn't go out much. And doesn't get along with her family well. It's like...her thing. Well, that could make it easier. Think. Where does she go when she goes out. Kampa Island, Petrin Hill, Letna Park. She doesn't like the city so much, she likes parks. So find her in one of those parks. Do you have friends that could help? We can call some people. I'll call Marian and the guys from the home, see who's available. I'll call Emma. I'll try some people from work. Give her the evening to come back. If she's not here in the morning, start the search. And then let the police know. Thanks, dad. Don't mention it. Call me if you need anything else? Right. Great. Take care. So we're starting tomorrow 9 am? Let's meet up here. Operation Bubo bubo. Tomorrow 9 am. Could we stay the night here? Sure, you can have Vicky's bed. Harvey can sleep on the couch. Right, where else. Just make sure to wake me up. I don't even know what 9 am looks like. I'm going to search for her now. I'm sorry I can't go with you. Someone should stay here anyway. I feel so useless. You're not. I wanted to tell you that nothing happened between me and your dad. Glad to hear that. And that I appreciate you helping us all. That goes without saying. I don't think it does. I figured a few things these last few days. Like what? Mr. Bentley, Jaguar, Fiat, Public Transportation. I deleted their numbers. And dad? Mr. Audi? I never had his number in the first place. Seriously. Let's keep it that way, please. I already feel like I compete with the entire world. But you don't have to. Go. Help them find Vicky. Right. Operation Bubo bubo. I'm on it. Vicky! Marian, go that way, please. You can check that area. I'll check the central area. And we'll meet here in an hour. - Okay. - Good. Vicky! Vicky Vicky! Vicky! Vicky! Vicky! - Anything? - No, nothing. Vicky! Vicky! Vicky! Vicky! Vicky! Vicky! [Vicky screams] Vicky! [Vicky screams] My god, what are you doing? What are you doing? Robin!
