Mr. Bogatso, can you tell us more about the new musical you're directing? Yeah, yeah of course. Where do I begin? We want to challenge the labeling of the Zulu culture as patriarchal, by telling the story of this magnificent woman, who was instrumental in building the Zulu nation. Yeah. I feel that Africa is filled with female leaders that are not celebrated enough. You know people like Mmanthatisi of the Batlokwa, Nefertiti the Egyptian queen, Modjadji the rain queen and of course, Mkabayi kaJama, aunt of the great Shaka. Now, she was political power behind five successful kings, this is the story that must be told, because especially young girls and women, they need to understand that they are descendants of queens. Everything she's saying, yeah, pretty much. Mama, Ma, sorry ma'am, where can I get a taxi to Southgate? Haibo nthombi, it's dangerous out here, you busy running around?

Khanyi will be okay man. She will be, I know she will be. Come on guys, really? Khanyi's a big girl, she probably found herself a man.

Yeah, just leave your numbers with production, we will definitely be in touch. - Thank you. - Yeah, thanks. - We'll definitely call you. - Yeah, we'll get back. We will call her, we do need her, you're welcome. Yeah. Wow. - Oh hi. - Hello. I'm Mongi, nice to meet you. - Khanyi. - Khanyi, welcome. This is my friend Velma - Hello.

I think you share a room with me, Charmer Boy here is Shakes, he's kind of like creepy uncle that sort of underage girls. This way. - Got it. - Thank you. How are they? They're getting along, they gel well together, I think we made a good selection. - We? - Yes G, we. Hallo Lu. Mak. - Vivian, look at you. - So good to see you. All right, good morning, good morning everybody, MD let's start with a vocal warmup. Ialalalalalalalala and! Lalalalalalalalala Lalalalalalalalala Keep going! - Lalalalalalalala - Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrr - Lalalalalalalala - Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrr - Lalalalalalalala - Brrrrrrrrrrrrrr - Lalalalalalalala - Brrrrrrrrrrrrrr - Lalalalalalalala - Brrrrrrrrrrrrrr Stop! - Who's that? - Who? Oh, her? Her name is Khanyi, Khanyi. Yeah, she's really great, you must hear her sing. How did she get here? - Vivian? - Yes? Vivian? Yeah, she brought her back, on the day of the callbacks, we all think she's great and we've all agreed. Bag. Now babe, babe, just listen, all right, just give her a chance, trust me. I know she's really good, you'll like her. She's good, rough around the edges, but she's good. All right, let's continue with the vocal warmup. Lalalalalalalala So, you don't worry about your weight at all. My weight? Girl, I need my pap, plus we dancing so much, I'll work all of this off. Yeah look, I could never eat, I'd have to take a nap straight after, for sure. Yeah, but you've got the chops ay? Chops? But this is beef. I meant you're really good at Zulu dancing. Thank you. Listen up, think about it, when they move in unison, which is symbolic of the way, because they are twins, in Zulu culture, that only one of them is supposed to live. Yeah sure sure Director, that is why umJama put his foot down. True, true, now turn to the next page, turn. It is as if they are one person, but it's only when Mkabayi becomes regent, that Mmama falls in the background, thus becoming a shadow, instead of a mirror image. Now people, it this very important for me, that you get into the heart and soul of the story, all right?

Hm, yeah, he's not that bad. I don't want it to look anything like The Lion King. Don't get me wrong, I love what they did, but it's very "Serengeti Safari", very "Africa's one homogenous country", no, I don't want that, I want it to be authentically Zulu. I want it to take me to the heart of KwaZulu-Natal, Don't forget, at the beginning of our story, the locals had not met the colonial settlers. So I don't want any of that influence, I want a very natural path. Like I'll craft the soil gold like summer grass, actual white, browns like tanned leather, something like that. Yeah exactly, exactly. Now let's make sure we got some animals, that take me to the heart of a homestead, chickens, pigs, whatever you can come up with and down by the river set, I want hippos, crocodiles. Okay, but we do you need to leave space on stage, for actors and dancers. I agree. Yeah, I know that. I know that, but I need an elephant, I want this to be a totally immersive experience, for our audience. I want them to feel like they were there, yeah? Let's get to it. Hi, hey, I'm Lu, you Khanyi, right? I hear you from out of town, Nongoma. Tell me, are you a Zulu princess? Aren't all Zulu girls princesses? Look man, I just wanna show you around, I wanna show you Joburg, it's not gonna be a date, it's just gonna be a friendly outing. No, thanks. All right thank you Nel, that'll be it. Ah whatever, I'm a salads girl, now. Uh, yes girl. Guys please wait for me, I just need to speak to... Bro Mak, do you have a minute? Yeah, Khanyi right? Yes. Wassup? You know I'm being forward, it's fine. Nah, come on, spit it out. I dunno where to start. Start at the beginning. The beginning is always a very good place to start and action. Well, some of the historical facts in the show, are not well depicted. Is that right? And how would you know this? You see, I'm from Kwanongoma and my elders used to tell me all these historical stories, plus my grandfather was Usolwazi, which you would know better as a Google or Wikipedia. Google and Wikipedia. Well, thank you very much, Ms. Google and Wikipedia, we'll continue this conversation another time. - Thank you bro Mak. - Pleasure Khanyi. "Care is a little bit of Joburg, let me show you some more. XOXO, Lu.", that is so cute. This is cheese deluxe, it doesn't even snow in Joburg. Guys, do you think I should go? - Definitely. - No way. Wow, thanks, big help. - What have you got to lose? - Her dignity? He knows all the A-listers in Durban. And his banged almost all of them. He goes to all the huge parties. And sniffs all the powder and pops all the pills. - He is a door opener. - And a panty drama. - You need to go have fun. - Don't say I didn't warn you. Okay, we're gonna do some pliés, okay? - Okay. - And down, open, and up. Leg on the railing. I can't go nearly as fast as you. But you're doing so well my friend, we're gonna make a ballerina out of you soon. Trust me. You know, there's no better feeling than being on stage, honestly. Yeah?

Khanyi, Herry Fencer, she's my publicist, she is the best in the business. So, that's wonderful, a new star. You are utterly delicious darling, guys let's take a selfie. Okay, ready? I ordered some real food for my Zulu princess. That's very sweet of you, but I'm actually starting to eat more like the girls now, salads and whatnot. Hi guys, enjoy. - Thank you. - Thank you. - That's not real food. - Come on, it's real food. So, tell me more about yourself, how's life like Kwanongoma? Ah you know, slow, rural, it's cozy, everybody knows everybody else. So do you milk cows and stuff like that? Yes, I groom the horses, you know, kill chickens. - Hmm. - I'm kidding. I was in college actually for three years, so I was away from the farm, but I used to do that as a child. Oh wow, you know when I was a kid, I thought washing dishes was a chore. Wow, lazy bones. You know what? Let's go show these people how to party. Okay. No, no, no, no, I don't like, it's too literal. It's not the remake of Shaka Zulu. This was your brief Mak. I want something more, ethereal. We need to give them something more symbolic, something that's more shed off the past. Okay, what do you want to changed? What do I want changed? Stay with me, work with me. We have three major scenes to consider. One, the conundrum that King Jama finds himself in, which of the twins to sacrifice, Mkabayi or Mmama. Two, Mkabayi courting Mthaniya for King Jama, and finally, Shaka's death. Now, can you work with that? Mh, mh, mh. All right, tell me what you see. - Silhouette. - Silhouettes, all right. - Ghost like apparitions. - Ghost like apparitions, yap. Elements more than anything realistic. Now we're talking, can you do that? - That I can do Mak. - That we can work with, all right, get to work, thank you very much. Make sure your cow doesn't fall off. You do like the cow sir? Yeah, I like the cow, thank you so much then Dendelani. So Khanyi, I see you've hit a big tide. Khanyi, on the A-list for sure. Come on, you're supposed to be pleased... No one does publicity without my consent, okay? Gugu relax, all publicity is good publicity. You pull this trap, one more time, I'll fire all of you, you hear me? Including you, Luyanda? Thank you, this is big. Welcome to the industry and today's incident, it is what it is. Don't pay attention to Gugu, you'll get used to it. Just be punctual, bring your A-game and do your best, all right? - Will do, thanks. - Where's Catherine? Well, you know Catherine, always speaking to her mommy on the phone. Don't hate, some of us have incredible moms, okay? Like my mum, she's always just let me be me, you know? Accepted me for who I am, even when I was a kid. Let me tell you guys about my father. You see, my dad made me go to EVT College to study, wait for it, accounting. What? Yeah, right? Me in accounting. Well his plan, his big plan was for me to get married, have like a hundred kids and then run our family business. Look, enough about your dad, what about your mom? Well, if you must know, I don't know my mum. - Maybe it's Gugu. - Ah Zetu no. You never know. - Can you imagine? - No, I mean, I can categorically say I've known her for a hund... no, a million years, it's impossible. She has a reason for no babies, no kids, not even you, sorry, but... Amen to that. Sis Viv, are you okay to drive tonight? I've been drinking all my life. Cheers. You come here, bruh, can I have this please? - Don't try me. - Wena, come here. Are you sure? I'm not trying you, come, come. , go play with, this is a man's game. Warrior boy, show me what you got. Come. Don't you ever, ever call me that again, okay? That's what you get. Warrior woman, boy. Oh Khanyi, just in time, welcome, welcome, coffee? No thank you. All right, sit down, don't be shy. You're probably wondering why I called you here, I just wanted to pick your brain a little bit. Oh, so you're not firing me. Oh, don't be silly, I'm not firing you. You're actually doing a great job in the show. Thank you. Now, I'm having a bit of trouble, with Mkabayi's history and was hoping that you could help me. - Ah no problem, that I can - Great stuff. Now, I'm being very careful here, I don't want to portray her as a monster, even though there are a lot of harsh events that she's part of, the murder of Dingane, the murder of Shaka, but I feel that that's another side to her. She, if you think about it, is one of the first true feminists, she never got married, she never got children and she dedicated her entire life, to building the Zulu Empire. That's true bro Mak, but actually there's another side to her. Oh pray, do tell. See, there's an expression in Zulu, , which means, consultant Mkabayi for any solution. Of course. And that shows that one of her lasting legacies, is her ability to listen and help people, which Dingane for instance, failed to do, 'cause he decided to exclude himself from people, which was the reason for his downfall. Oh, interesting, interesting, tell me more. Well, she was actually considered the brains behind Shaka's victories. - Really? - Yeah. She would come on to the abaQulusi Imbibi before they went to battle, they'd say she had a brain of a man, which of course they thought was a compliment. Of course they did, but is there more? Well, she was actually like the bravest... My, this looks cozy. Yeah, Khanyi was just giving me a history lesson. I need to talk to you right now, you may leave Khanyi. - Hi. - Hello. - Welcome to my humble home. - Wow, humble. Supper will be ready soon, this way. No worries, I have all the time. This way.

When she tells me the romance between Shaka and Papatha, it actually makes the romance between Romeo and Juliet, Anthony and Cleopatra look boring. Baby, you can't keep taking advice from every Zulu on your stoop. Come on. That's a corny, and yet you are a Zulu girl. Yes I am. Well, you're right though, the story is already three hours long and we need to focus on Mkabayi, I mean, the story's about her. There's so much story to tell, so much story to tell. I was saying there's this other joint that I know and I would like you to see the guys there and meet the guys there, like these other guys, You saw those guys are so cool man, yeah? - Are you okay? - Yeah. Relax, I got you, relax. - Oh sorry, hey girls. - Hey, wassup? Hey, Lu dawg, you guys, you don't have to drive eh? You guys can ride with us, we just got an Uber. Zip, you not my mother. Okay Lu, everyone here, feels that you've had way too much to drink, look at you? Yeah Lu. You're not in the state to drive ay. Besides, you're not only putting your life in danger, you're also putting hers... Hey, are you Khanyi's spokesperson? Who the hell appointed you? Did you want some of this, huh? Do you want some of this? All right, look Lu, you can drive, okay? You can go, but Khanyi is not going anywhere with you, you hear me? Khanyi, I'm not gonna beg you. Brown muffin, I heard you had a good time last night. You must stick to Shakes and Shakes will bring heaven to your hell. Shakes, back off. Okay no, intervention needed. Yeah, next time don't drink like a fish. Hey guys, lesson learnt. Five, six and we go. Stop, see what happens when you cast from the countryside? She's got no technique whatsoever. I think she's doing just great Gugu, just give her time. He always does this, trying to turn a nobody into a somebody. It makes things complicated for me. Are you serious right now? Have you forgotten that once upon a time, someone gave you an opportunity. So I must give her an opportunity. Give her a chance. I must give Khanyi a chance. - Give Khanyi a chance. - Hmm, fine. Let's give her a chance. Gugu don't do this, Gugu please don't. Gugu? Space, shoes off. What's wrong sis Viv? - I feel so old. - What? In a few days, I'm gonna be 40. I feel like a grandmother and I know you guys are planning a surprise birthday party. Ah really, wow, who told you? Why can't you just let me just lie there? Lemme embrace my old age. Come on like, live a little. I mean, the class is already halfway through with the plans we've invited all your best friends. I guess I need to now practice my surprise face. Oh wow. What? You look kind of familiar, I feel like I know you. You're from Nongoma, right? Yes,. What's your father's name? Uphengmuzu Khumalu, he was a session musician here in Joburg, before he married my mom. What's his other name? Ezekiel, you know bass guitars, that typa thing. I knew it, that's who you are, you're Bright Easy's child. I knew it. You know, he told me people called him that, which is so odd though, 'cause he's so strict. I know right? Far from Easy. Khanyi, what's your mother's name? Her name is Poghazi, but she's not my biological mom, but she's still my mom, but not really. And what's your biological mom's name? Sbhongi, but she abandoned me, she was more focused on her career. I gotta go. Oh my word, sorry. The person you have dialed can't take your call now, after the tone, please record your message.

Speak of the devil. Babe, what's with the calls? I want you to let the new family get reacquainted. Family what? Hey Khanyi, wait, what are you talking about? You don't even remember me, do you? - You are? - Nnandi. - Nnandi? - Nnandi, we slept together Luyanda, after the opening of Club 42, your place, shooters, no protection? This is your baby, Luyanda. I don't believe you. Do you know how often girls try this crap with me? Which paper is paying you? This is not about money Luyanda, I just want my child to know his father. Okay, cool, have the baby send a DNA test to my lawyers, then we'll take it from there. And in the meantime, please leave me the hell alone. Khanyi, let's go. All right, ladies and gentlemen of the Malandela Theater Company, let us take a look at this, maintenance, please move this way, lighting. Lighting, we gotta take a look at that, thank you very much. Zetu, thank you very much my darling, just stand there. Nah, it's looking beautiful ladies, beautiful and we are standing by for Mmama's entrance! Vivian get yourself together. I am together, now that we are together. Viv. Hello darling. ♪ Open sesame. ♪ Standby left! - Close it please. - Come. Show time. And, uplift. Oh well, ♪ Show time. ♪ Vivian? Vivian! Move, move, move, move, move. Are you all right? Somebody call an ambulance, just take off her shoe. Just, easy, easy, easy! Vivian, Viv. She just fell off If the Department of Labor finds us negligent in this accident, MTC will be destroyed. I know Katrina. You know, she might not be able to dance, nevermind walk again. Well, now it's calling all the agents, we have to recast as soon as possible. Is that all you can think about right now? Someone must be practical, someone must think about the show. You know sometimes you got no compassion whatsoever. I worked too hard and too long to let this go to waste. When did you become so hard? Mak, I am hard because I have to be hard, okay? No woman makes it in this business, without being this way. For goodness sake, it's the 21st century, the world has changed. - You know, it hasn't, Mak. - Ah. - Viv, hey. - Sbhosh. - Hi. - Hi. I was coming to visit you and then I heard you were in an accident and then I just had to come and see you. - Thank you. - How are you? I'm good,. No, no, no forget about me, how are you? Could be better, but I'm okay. Thanks for coming. Anything for you. Sbhosh, the reason why I called you here was, well I needed to see you, I think you need to sit down first. Sbhosh, I checked my facts over and over, just to make sure that they're legit and every time I go back, they all point in the same direction. Do you remember when Easy said that your daughter had died? I know, it was a very difficult time for you and it still is. I work with a young lady, her name is Khanyi, her father's name is Easy, she's 22 Sbhosh. Oh there she, Khanyi, there she is. That's your daughter, that's Khanyi. Kanyi. My baby. My baby? Come. You abandoned me. Is that what your father told you? Please, let's sit and talk. I got a big break to tour the world with Mabatha, your father and I agreed that I could go and that it would take care of you. When I got back, I went straight to our place in Yeoville and when I got there, it was empty, abandoned, I called him. He told me that he had to go back home, for traditional obligations and that you got there and fell sick, and you died. I told him I wanted to see your grave, he said, "No". He said that there was no point, that I should just move on with my life and forget about you and him.

Vivian is hurt, Khanyi's disappeared, I don't know, I just don't know. Vivian, coming to rehearsals drunk, what was she thinking? I mean, she's supposed to be an example. As for Khanyi, there's always something strange about her, something that rubbed me the wrong way, something that made me feel uncomfortable. I knew it, it's because she's Sbonghile's daughter, they've got the same... Just stop! Just stop it Gugu, just stop it. We were inseparable, Bhongi, Viv and I, but then obviously Bhongi had to go, take my role and take my man... You're gonna have to let it go Gugu, you're gonna have to let it go. Just leave it all in the past and let bygones be bygones. Aunti. Just all a mess.. Take off your glasses, I want to see your eyes when you talk to me. What happened? Aunti, I met this woman in Joburg, she said that she's my mother. She told me stories about her and about to Baba and I come back home to speak to Baba and he gives me a totally different version. I really feel lost. I wish I listened to you, but you knew, why didn't you tell me? The truth. Decided that, it was the best way to make sure you're brought up here, Kwanongoma, in safety, with your family. He didn't want you to live in Johannesburg, somewhere in a flat with a bunch of strangers. I just don't know who I am anymore. , life can be complicated sometimes, but hey, it's life. Now that you know everything, don't you think it's time for you to decide who you really want to be? Well Mak, you know what this means then, hm? We're gonna have to put on our big girl panties and to pull the show together, we have to. ♪ Come with me, down paradise road ♪ ♪ This way please, I'll carry our load ♪ ♪ This you won't believe ♪ ♪ Come with me, down paradise road ♪ ♪ This way please, I'll carry our load ♪ ♪ This you won't believe ♪ ♪ Come with me, down paradise road ♪ ♪ This way please, I'll carry our load ♪ ♪ Please, paradise before us ♪ ♪ Paradise behind us ♪ ♪ Fire smoking, the sky is blazing, ♪ ♪ There's a woman weeping ♪ ♪ And I'm now nearly beaten all for love ♪ ♪ Paradise is almost closing down ♪ ♪ Come with me, down paradise road ♪ ♪ It'll change your life, it'll charge into ways ♪ ♪ This, you won't believe ♪ ♪ Take my hand, down paradise lane ♪ ♪ A wave of heartache, without any pain ♪ ♪ I know, 'cause I, I'm a believer ♪ ♪ Paradise before us ♪ ♪ And a burning bridge behind us ♪ ♪ Burning bridge behind us, yeah. ♪ Khanyi, please, just a moment. I don't know where to start, I don't know what to say, but I'm here. Khanyi , a lot of sacrifices had to be made. I know it must be tough for you right now, but hopefully with time you'll understand. I've forgiven your father, I forgave his family, I forgive myself, Khanyi please forgive us. Baba, please excuse me, I just need to get to work. We'll talk about this, some other time. So company, we are busy recasting for Vivian's role, my lovely Catherine, you'll be standing in for her. Wardrobe, make up! I wanted you to talk to you about that. Where's Khanyisile Khumalo? She's not here, Sis Gugu, we actually haven't seen her in a while. 'Cause I feel we can cast from within it's... Wait Sis Gugu, I'm here. Khanyi, Khanyi come here, come here. Malandela, the role of Mmama will be played by Khanyisile Khumalo. "Princess, I'm in a dark place, let these sunflowers bring me your light, "missing you bad, Lu." He's so cheesy. The Prince of darkness can stay in the dark. Khanyi, that is terrible. Take your flowers. - Girl mh mh. - He's your man. - Nnandi. - Let's go. They often say, a bad final dress rehearsal, is a sign that we're gonna have a good opening show. So I think we'll have a good one tonight, we've sorted out all the technical glitches, all the costumes have been repaired, so we should not see your boobies again Zetu. On a serious note though, on a serious note, we've put in an incredible amount of work into this show and I just want every single one of you to know that, you've done well and you've all worked very hard and you've done good work and I'm very proud of each and every single one of you. So I can not say break the leg because Viv broke her leg, so we can only say in true theater culture, chuka. See all let's go, - Chuka. I've always wanted to come back home and tell the story of my people, with the same spectacle as we did tonight. Well I hope you give us a quick review and hear the stars of the show. Enjoy the evening. Enjoy the evening. Khanyi, Khanyi, Khanyi Wow, what a great performance tonight.
