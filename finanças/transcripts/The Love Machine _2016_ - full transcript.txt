She didn't look like Eva Green at all. When I met her she had a pink laptop and hair extensions and she thought Fellini was a brand of champagne. It was clear that she couldn't be my girlfriend. ﻿At that very moment I realized that I had fallen in love with her. ﻿I threw a snowball at her, but she just kept smiling like nothing happened. It was almost glowing. She really liked everything that was happening to her. He had never seen that before, and he was impressed. Like he stepped straight out of a Disney cartoon. Then I found out she was a nymphomaniac and that quickly bonded us. We both liked sex, so it took me some time to realize that we were different. That we weren't a good couple. was just excited because of the incredible sex we had. But sex is not enough. So I started to realize that I couldn't be with her anymore. I'd love to, but then I realized that I had to get out of that Disney cartoon. At first I started sleeping in another room, but then I decided to tell him that we were going to break up. But what's interesting, is that she wasn't surprised or scared. He just smiled and said, "I don't think so." I don't think we're done. I asked him why and he told me: - "Well, because we can't." - "But why?" "Because we're like Twix bars. We can't break." For 18 months now , I've been trying to tell Natasha that we're not together anymore. But she just laughs and says we're like Twix bars. Sometimes I feel like I've stepped into a Gone Girl version documentary, but unlike Ben Affleck, it was happening to me in real life. Natasha, did you have a lobotomy as a child? Don't you understand that I'm dating another girl now? When will you leave my apartment? That apartment is mine, you know. Who's your new girl? She 43 of 00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,239 Her name is Masha. She's just another girlfriend, you've always dreamed of having sex with one of your students. - It doesn't mean anything. - What's going on? When will you leave? Like in a week. Tell me, how long is your week? - Look, I need... - No, tell me how long? I need to find a new flat. I can't move now. It's uncomfortable for me to live in Masha's flat. - It's been two weeks now. - Well, come live here. I will when you give me the keys and leave. I need some time to find a new place. I think as a man you should wait a bit. Especially since you're in love and enjoying it. You don't have to be so ironic. - We feel great together. - How about your sex? 00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,159 Okay, but... Damn, go to hell! Our sex is fine and that's not the point... We don't have sex now because Masha is fasting. That's why we don't have privacy, do you understand? I don't, I'm just asking you how was the sex. I think it's a normal question. After all, we are friends now. And we have great sex, and great relationships and work. Yeah, so cool that I've been trying to get rid of you for almost a year. Everything is super cool! I don't know what to say. I gave you money to pay the rent. I'm not going to kick you out. But you see, we can't be together. It's not the fault of the bluray disc that you can't fit them into a VCR. It's not the fault of the bluray disc. I adore your metaphors. lot. Do you remember how on our way to St. Petersburg we stayed in that cool hotel in Novgorod? No, I don't remember anything. Maybe it was you who had a lobotomy then? I wish it were like that, but I don't know how, what to Google, where to get one, so I can forget about you. Don't you know what happened to me yesterday? No, tell me. I created the movie:"The Eternal Shining of the Immaculate Mind? I think it's such a good script that you can go somewhere and they'll erase your girlfriend from the memory. The one that bothers you like Glenn Close in "Fatal Attraction" Don't bother, you know how it ends. Natasha, just pack your things and move, okay? Do it in a week or ten days. 00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,719 I'll give you time. You understand that this time we're done for real, okay? FILMS LOST SOULS PRESENTS A FILM BY GERALD "LOVE MACHINE" Part one:The Great Escape. She sometimes thought that I wasn't the one she needed. It was him. They had their own mysterious relationship, that I know nothing about. That I only annoy them, that they want to get rid of me. No, she's not moving. She doesn't do anything wrong, she just doesn't leave. It's not that I do crazy things, no. It's just ordinary crazy Natasha. He writes to me that he is bleeding to death, that he would see me in the afterlife. And he didn't know where she was. I responded by saying: "Okay, let's get back together again, I'll go to St. Petersburg tomorrow." Just to distract her and comfort her. She did not respond for three hours. -I didn't know where she was. -Maybe she was busy. What would you think if she doesn't answer for three hours? You would be scared and you would feel guilty, right? No, I thought she was dead! What should I do with the body and how to live after that? Feeling guilty is a fact. You know, it's like going on a date with a black hole. to tell her that she's not your girlfriend anymore. I am a fashion guy, an auteur film director. That's interesting to me. But when such a film like Cannes comes out, I prefer the conventional. If I tell a girl to leave, she leaves. Guys, we are discussing an irrelevant topic. Natasha is a dead issue for me already. She doesn't bother me, really. 00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,799 I don't think about her anymore. Hello. You're not coming back again. I just wanted to thank you. I started watching movies from the list you left me. Yesterday I saw the great film "Harold and Maude." I liked it a lot. He reminded me of us a bit. You are the grandmother, of course. I would like to see it with you. But I didn't like "Fatal Attraction". Why did you cook the rabbit? I don't know why you said it was like the protagonist. I'm afraid he'll kill us 00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,679 because I think Natasha has gone crazy. Literally crazy. It's like Freddy Krueger. Imagine Freddy Krueger murdering everyone and they say: "Freddy, go to therapy." What is a therapist going to tell him? "Freddy, don't kill people." And he says:"Yeah, sure." 00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,799 And then he kills someone again. It's useless because he's crazy, 00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,679 and I feel sorry for her. It's called Gestalt or something like that. - What is that? - Just finish it. I never understood the word "Gestalt." Sounds like a Nazi air force unit. Something from Nazi Germany. SS, Gestapo, Gestalt. 00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,799 What is Gestalt? I don't understand. How can I close my Gestalt? What do you mean? Fine, I'll close it. But what is it? Unlike you, I haven't studied anywhere. I am not an educated man. Tell me, what is the Gestalt? Well, let's close the topic. 00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,039 By the way, I think your chest is like a cool indie film. A low budget one, but one of the good ones. And huge breasts are like a $200 million blockbuster. You go to see it and all you see is the money invested. You have small breasts, which is a $300,000 film. But a very good one. Some women say:"I have a bust of $200 million, it's like that. I am not going to study, read, learn things. I'll just be a girl with $200 million breasts. I have boobs that are blockbusters." And it's sad, very sad. Sometimes I think my brain is like big breasts I don't need to do anything because my brain is great I don't need to educate myself. I have the illusion that I am a girl with big tits. Because I'm very fast and I can make a joke now. - Tell me to make you a joke. - Make me a joke. - Make a joke about a coffee house - About a coffee house. Well, here's a joke about a coffee house. My friend has been working in a coffee house for five years. Always before coming to his girlfriend, he would usually ask her: "For here or to take away?" Well, at least it was fast. You know, without a doubt. The stupidest thing in art is doubt. I don't want to sit and watch a movie where every shot is done with such precision that it makes me like it. It's like a fucking call girl: "I'm here to satisfy you." But keep looking at the time. I hate films where they keep checking the time. "The viewer will leave, let's cut here and there." I want to watch a movie with the breasts that she really has. I want to see films with small breasts. But vital, beautiful and fun like you. ﻿﻿send me to you so that you are more free. What's about you? Were you kidnapped as a child by the Taliban? Or were you raised among terrorists in an Afghan village? Why are you so shy? What are you sorry for? I don't like it. God created your soul, but the devil created your ass? Why do the best things belong to the devil? It's terrible. I want us to live fully. I want us to read, listen to music and fuck five times a day. And I want you to stay pregnant all the time. To be like an iconic director traveling around the world with his pregnant little wife. And his belly is always bigger than his head. Because his sex life never stops. They will say: "Yes that an iconic director Ruminov with his wife." "How do you manage to keep up." And we will have a huge black babysitter with a giant ass. She will raise our children, we will have fun and we will live. The children will love us, do you know why? Because we will never be boring. We will never bother you. I see and hear that my new life is coming. You are my new life. 00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,679 Imagine you're dating Gary Oldman, but young. Imagine an ordinary night with Gary Oldman. - It would bite me. - Clear. It's an ordinary night with Gary Oldman. You wake up and your ear is missing. When I was a child, every time I felt sad I went to a toy store with my mother. I thought it was a planet where there was no death, sadness, pain or disappointment. And now I feel sad here, even scared. It is completely rebuilt. Now it seems that you are in a world where The Terminator won. Or Darth Vader. Here are his masks. I fear that because of all this I will also pass to the dark side. And lose my soul. I feel like ET the Alien on a strange planet. Hello, ET This world of terrifying and strange. We are all here as ET the Extra-Terrestrial. We should stick together. Don't you understand? Do you think of me? Do you remember the moment when I couldn't open the knob? I really did it on purpose because I realized it made you laugh I like... ...to make you laugh. My mother didn't talk to me much. 00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,999 I lived mainly in my father's house. Well, both here and there. And for some reason I don't remember my mother ever talking to me or discussing anything. That's why I'm constantly looking for my mother. So be more careful with me, okay? Where am I going? I don't even like that song. stupid song. Of course, it's just a matter of perception, and there are no stupid songs. But I have a feeling that song is objectively stupid. It would be great to fuck her and relieve the tension. Should I send you a picture of my penis? ﻿No, no. I will not. I will stay until the end. This time I will finish the story. from her and from this damn cinema. And I will have a different life. I don't know how it will be, but it will be real. Damn, I have another boner. As if I had put a microchip in my penis, and now it controls me, it sends me signals there to make me think of her all the time. Damn, I don't want to film this music video. I would love to fuck her now. But without thinking that it means anything. Fuck her and then erase her memories like in Men in Black. 00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,079 I 'll run away from you, understand? Why are you laughing? I'm glad I came to this exhibition. It's good to go somewhere alone once in a while. I thought it would be great if he was with me. Serega is a great guy. He's so cool that he had his own exhibition of him. Lots of new works. I like people who do what makes them burn. When they achieve their goals. I like Lena. We've been discussing BDSM and 50 Shades of Gray all night. I guess he wouldn't mind a threesome. Exactly. Surely he won't resist. She adjusts to what she likes: Creative, mysterious, young. have sex with her and she'll realize I'm the only one who understands. Why should I lose myself? In fact, he wants to be with me. What happens is that his brain deceives him. I'm not offended by that. My mother also often punished me in childhood. But then she was ashamed of it. I don't understand what's going on. A part of me is trying to leave and another to stay. And who am I? I am very tired of this bloody paradox of human nature. When I finally get used to it, it will be time to die. It's so stupid... It's very poorly conceived. Damn, these are just thoughts. I need to think of something else, I imagine that my thoughts are clouds or trees. These are just thoughts. Damn, I'm not these thoughts. I want something more than just fucking her from behind. I want something else. 's kind of a warm feeling though. I want to fuck her the same way she wanted goalkeeper gloves as a child. He played soccer and it seemed to me that if he had those gloves, I would be the best goalkeeper in the world. Real Adidas gloves. 00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,279 Stop, stop. Why a Minion? Why is he wearing a Minion mask? Is my subconscious trying to tell me that she's so cool as a Minion and I mistreat her? Damn, even my conscience won't leave me alone here. Even though I escaped from the Kingdom of Masturbation it's hard for our consciousness to find us there. But damn, he's so unreachable. And now it's going to torment me because I recorded this movie with many shots of my penis. But what's wrong with that? All directors film their penises. Only that they take the forms of spaceships or armies marching into battle or a huge budget. But one way or another it's a movie about his penis. It's not my fault that they won't let me record expensive films. They think I'm a drug addict, even though my penultimate film was awarded at Kinotavr. The last one was a commercial and it didn't do very well. I have to film what I can. , who said that? Me or who thinks it's a lie? The things I just said and the ones I even left in the movie. , what's going on? I don't understand anything. Nobody understands. They're just pretending, so they don't look like weirdos. I had a dream about this not long ago. I was walking the streets with my pet. name was Jackie and he looked very strange. It looked like a Gremlin or a purple eel or whatever they call it. Everyone asked me what that was. Is it dangerous? Won't it bite us? And I told them that it was Jackie, that he was well behaved. That he was harmless as a pokemon. Everyone was fine with it, they took pictures of it and petted it. But the curious thing was that I couldn't know what it was and where he had come from, although every day he fed Jackie and walked him. I couldn't get rid of him, he was always by my side. So at one point I finally realized who he was. Jackie was my brain. And in fact, I don't know anything about him, although every day I pretend that I am his master, the master from Jackie. Although I say don't worry that Jackie isn't going to bite you, I really don't know what he's going to do. I never know what happens to my brain. I don't know what Jackie is or what to expect from him. his own weird decisions and I just go along with them. I just do what Jackie tells me to do. I am very tired of being responsible for that. I'm so tired of pretending that I know what it is and why he made me do this movie. I feel incredible love for you right now. It makes my mind fizzy like champagne. now I feel as if nothing and no one could separate us. I want to be with you. You will be my Walt Disney and I will be your Mickey Mouse. PART TWO:SHOW TIME Inside each girl is her mother. They met and grew to like each other. She is ready for everything, to get naked. And you are near the main room in a bank. You are opening the vault and everything is happening. That is all. You have broken all the barriers. You are prepared to do what she wants. Ready to take it. And at that very moment, it's like in those films where you hear voices in your head. Like The Exorcist for example, do you know this movie? It's about a pretty girl with a voice like... Her mother appears out of nowhere and says, "I'm not ready yet!" I don't even know you! That's wrong! And you think:"My God, how do I comfort my mother?" "Please, tell your mother that I am a good man." Or that I will give him a gift. Because no mother will allow her daughter to have more sex than her. But really, the best sex is without a penis. 00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,199 That is what I have understood. AND NOW WE CONTINUE WITH THE SHOW Why do you want to take me out? I came to visit my friends. - I'll go quickly. - Why did you come? - And what do you have in your eye? - It's makeup. It's sexy, isn't it? Stop pretending you're a saint. - Pasha, take your hands off him. - I'm not touching her, relax. Go away, don't touch me. Am I a terrorist at the Tel Aviv airport? By the way, I brought you your e-book. Take. Did you want it? You got it. - Is that why you came? - Yes. Did you finish? Good girl. - And I came to see my friends. - Pasha, relax. 00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,679 - When will you move? - In a week. Were you at the audition for a Kiss biopic? What's with your face? You look like a country Courtney Love. with that. Don't you like it? I like it, Natasha, you're great! Let's take a picture of us. - Let's take a selfie. - Time for a selfie - Natasha! - Damn, something is wrong. Here is the magic button. - Ready. - Well, it looks good. Do you like this guy? No? - Look, he's great. - Why are you bothering me? Let me drink the wine. I came here after the concert. - A good guy, right? - Yes. Are you drunk again? - No. - Enough, I'll call your friend Rafael. 00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,919 Go ahead. Hey, can you come pick up your crazy friend? No! - Yes, at Sasha's house. - Raf, come here! What? Did you rummage my book? what do you want? sit together. Get out of the apartment then! Calm down. Guys... Now you wear glasses like Ray Charles? - For our... - For love. Yes. For our sex maniac. - The wine is good, by the way. - A little bitter. Natasha, a pleasure to have met you. You're so cool. Pasha told us about you. You're missing me. Before these conversations I thought you were one way, because I didn't know you before... But you're completely different. Since when have you not had sex? Long ago? Well, I don't know. Maybe I have. - Let me finish. - I do not care. Pasha, let me finish! - What a stupid deception. - I don't believe it. - And what do you think? - I think you do care. I think you've already thought three times today and that's the limit. - No, Natasha? - You are so smart. These are all stereotypes, Pasha. The clichés about blondes. 00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,279 Don't do a stupid parody of me. It's not like you've been dating Steven Hawking for 3 years, you've known how the universe works. He wouldn't have talked as much, you know. - Lots of information. - Who? Who exactly? Tell me. Good, Steven Hawking. How do you know? Did you read a book about him? I saw a movie. About Steven Hawking. He couldn't talk as much because at a certain point he couldn't talk at all. He was paralyzed. He just wasn't talkative like you. No, he was speaking through a computer! He played the buttons. I really admire you. Really. - I am neither an angel nor a monster. - I also admire myself. I'm only human. I met Masha. You see, we are sitting together. Yes, I saw them kissing when I entered. We can also post it on Instagram for you. So you can see it every morning. Very good. - They are so cute, look at them. - Yes we are. Although she looks more like your daughter, why not. -At least she doesn't look like your granddaughter. -Although she is your age. You don't look like my daughter, because you drink too much and you look like 38 years old. - Congratulations. - No, because I'm bigger. You are beautiful. You have done well. Well, I understand now that you came after the concert. 00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,159 I brought you a gift. Not just the e-book. For Masha. Go ahead. In which hand? - The right? - You guessed it. Pasha gave it to me before our trip to Tunisia. Natasha. I want you to inherit it from me. Natasha, I think it's yours. It's beautiful, thank you. But it's yours. I don't think it's mine, because it emanates wrong energy. It's not the energy of love, you know? Things should emanate from love. So I get rid of things that don't emanate that energy. That's why I want to give it to you. - Take it. - Sorry Sorry. You see? The violence begins. I told you. Does the violence begin? Shit, Pasha, have you gone crazy? - We should talk. - Hey, Pasha, don't touch her. We will solve it ourselves. We have been doing it for 4 years. Don't touch me! Let us talk! Don't touch Pasha! That is our private life. What are you doing? Let us speak in peace. Come here. Why didn't you go to the concert? - Cheers. - There's no reason to celebrate. - Raffaelo, just take her. - Raphael. What's so funny? Why do you always call him Raffaelo? Like a sweet. You're drunk. What's going on? I don't understand. He got a little hysterical. - Raffaelo. - Raphael. - Do you like Natasha? - A lot of. Why don't they get to know each other better? I will when necessary. - What do you mean? - Well, I don't want to know. Where did she come from? Do you have any valuable information? How did you meet her? Maybe you were walking down a street and suddenly smoke appeared. And then a creature came out of the underworld. I'm not from the underworld, I'm from heaven. From heaven? Safe? - You were right. - In which? - In that he did not let go. - I didn't let go? What have I not released? Leave me alone. 's a mystery to me that they can't be together. Grab her ass and go to my apartment she doesn't want to leave. I still live there because I haven't found an apartment. Natasha, you know you can always move into my apartment. - Get out of here, both of you. - Fine. I'll move into your apartment tomorrow. Pasha, I will leave tomorrow. See you? It seems that she is 16 years old. Yes, of course. - Or maybe 18. - Maybe 18. - Damn, who are you? - I'm a ninja, come here. I am a werewolf and I will tear you to pieces. We're leaving soon. I go to the bathroom and we'll leave. We'll be leaving soon. It feels like I'm on a spaceship now. It's like a spaceship. Get me out of here, please. I want to fly away, please let me come on board. Let me get on board. fly. Please, I want to fly... We'll be there soon. Very good. Well, I'm not going to touch you. Fasting is important. Well, we'll be there soon. Goodbye. We'll be there soon. Good. . - What's wrong? - What happened to the door? It is locked from the inside. Give me a knife. - It had never happened before. - Never. Is it locked? I'm not a good carpenter. It's working. Yes, it opened! Hello. Why don't you answer my messages? - Hello. - Hello. What are you doing in my apartment? I came to visit you. Masha. Okay, we can go and... Stop. Masha... - Pasha, what's wrong? - I dont know. - How did he stay inside? - Maybe we didn't close the door. Why is he following you? I'm scared. One day I'm going to wake up and cut my throat, Pasha. Calm down. Of course he won't. Pasha. - But what else can I do? - Call Rafael, he will take it. - Natasha. - Than? If you don't leave now, I'm going to call the police. I'm going to call the police. We have every reason for them to arrest you. - What reasons? - Than? - I'm just a guest. - A guest. - What do you have on your face? - A star. It's been a week. You've had it in your face this whole time! A damn week has passed, have you seen yourself in the mirror? What do you want? - I sent you a message. - What did you write? I want to sleep with you one last time. Then I'll leave you alone. The hat completes your madness. Now it looks better on you. It's crazier. Give me back my hat, damn it. It's Masha's hat. Natasha, it can't be like that. - It shouldn't be. - Why? Who says what is right and what is wrong? Nobody knows that. I'm with another girl now. I left. Okay. 00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,279 Leave me, as you left your son. Shit. - I didn't let him! - Yes, you did it. I didn't! I'm going to see him, I live nearby. I live nearby, I didn't leave it. And I wouldn't have left you if you had calmed down. I didn't let him. Do not hit me. I don't want you to hit me. I don't want to hit you. Don't ever talk about him again, okay? I ask you. I'm trying to pull myself together. Please, he tries to do the same. I try to calm down. I'll call Rafael, he'll take you. Call him. I'll call Rafael and not the police, okay? - Call him. - Don't scare Masha. She has nothing to do with it. Yes, of course. She broke into our house, damn it, and she's blackmailing me. She scared Masha. Come, I'll send you the address. What's so funny? What the fuck? Do we have a saw? Masha, did you have one? , stop. Stay away, okay? No, I don't understand anything, damn it. Masha, he has a saw. I'm going to turn it on, okay? I'll cut my throat. 01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,759 - Is this what you want? - Take it easy. My beautiful throat that you used to kiss all the time. What the hell are you doing? Cut it off, damn it! Stupid girl. Did you put gasoline in it? You did it? My eyes burn. It's okay. It's okay. Calm down. Thank you. Didn't you know that you should put gasoline before using it? - Didn't you know that, love? - I did not know, I did not know it. - Did you think it would work like this? - Yes. Good girl. Did you think about cutting your throat and then what? How would we live with that? You are selfish damn. Even worse than me. It's not fair. It's not fair that you're gone. At some point you told me you didn't need me. And if Masha is not good for you? I'm here, by the way. 01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:17,239 01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,279 Masha, can we have sex one last time? You are a bear. I got goosebumps. Let's go to sleep and that's it. Ok? Good. Next time put gas before cutting your throat. Masha is fasting, so we won't have sex. Don't try to take advantage of it. I know I say it so that I know that if it touches me and I have a boner, it has nothing to do with it. Thank you for allowing me to spend the night with you. I feel very lonely right now and I don't like sleeping alone. I know it's hard for you to sleep alone. Well, stay with us for a while. Let's reset everything, okay? - Try to accept everything, okay? - Good. Masha, if Pasha sleeps with me one last time, I will leave them forever. Do you want to sleep in the kitchen? We have floor heating. You can sleep there. Well, I'm not a dog to sleep on the floor. Natasha, don't touch me. Think I'm your father. You wouldn't touch your father, would you? But I am very tender and kind, I have never done anything wrong to you. Apart from the fact that you came here with a star on your face and tried to cut your throat. Come on, I want to sleep. Hug me. - Do you hear him? - Yes. Do you know what that is? It's my heart beating. Do you know what it says? Do you know the language of the heart? I do. He says:"I love you, Masha." That's why it doesn't mean anything that I have sex with her. Which I'm not going to do. But I wouldn't change anything, you know? - Do you hear me? - But that's what I want. 01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,879 I told you to fuck me, it's not going to change anything. We will leave this floor and go to a hotel. I'll leave you here. not reduce it to the absurd. I'm just afraid of sleeping alone. When I was little I used to run with my mother and I slept with my parents on the sofa. Since then I almost never sleep alone. - I did the same. - Did you also go with your parents? I don't know how they managed to conceive my sister. She always interrupted them. When we met you had a pink laptop. I asked you if you knew who Fellini was and you told me if a champagne. My favorite champagne is Mondoro. We're not your biographers, okay? We won't write a book about you. You don't need to tell us all those things. Just go to sleep. I no longer have feelings for you. I remember that tomorrow I have a grade, so what? Yes, it's my movie. I remember everything. You are my executive producer. I appreciate that you can't sleep because of the project. But it's my film No, I didn't go back to Natasha again. 01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,599 It's not Natasha, I'm watching a movie. They are the voices of the film. Thank you very much and I appreciate your concern for our film. But I'm going to smash my cell phone against the wall or I'll cut it. You know, I have something very suitable for that. Say hello to Natasha? what the fuck She 765 He has gained weight for the first time in his life. He says that he is training and carries 10 kgs. - With a serious face? - With a serious face, forcing himself. He says that he is going to be an athlete and that all the girls will love him. The Oswiecim champion in bodybuilding. What did you say? I said you were the Osweicim champion of bodybuilding. It was your last stupid joke. She's nice. Don't touch my girlfriend. Lesbian. you who made me sleep with girls. I'm not a lesbian. Bring me some wine. I told Masha everything. Did you understand? I'm glad you're honest. He is very honest, Masha. will never lie to you. - Yes, I'm not lying. Yes, I had sex with two women. Yes, I liked it. And? Bring me wine and stop making excuses. I feel that they are my lesbian mothers and that I have to justify myself for behaving badly. Lies. - He came! - Maybe it works, shall we try? Do you have gasoline from the previous owner? Please move the saw away. Go. Natasha, please. Today I am your father, please, he stops showing me his bare legs. If you are my father, bring me some wine! It is as if he were in the filming of Caligula. I can't live with you anymore because you're an unbearable bitch. I have never been a bitch. You gave that Canadian guy a pat when he was sleeping. It is better to give a pat on the back than to be raped. A parallel universe. You know, sometimes I think... My parents died of cancer and many people continue to die from it on a daily basis. What is cancer? It's when you want to spread out. It is when a cell wants to be bigger than the body. And when you shoot a movie like this about breaking up, I wanted people to see it after breaking up with others . Then they say:"That more people see this film." "Go ahead, it's great." Being that I am a cancer cell And I think the older I am the cooler it will be. People are like cancer, you know? Have you read about corporations? What are your plans? Open chains of their restaurants in another new country. In North Korea, for example. So their goal is to spread and that's all. I feel like I'm a cancer cell. 01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:54,479 Once I had a dream. That a cancer cell entered the cinema and was watching a movie about people dying of cancer and suddenly understands that she destroys herself and others leaves the movie theater and starts crying. kills children and itself. It's weird to think you're cool just because more people know your name. It's a lie. Our parents were ordinary people. They gave birth to us, thanks to them we exist. We just exist. Drink wine and live daily. He is super cool. Well, actually I'm a rock star. Masha, I'm a rocker, not a killjoy. I want to play in clubs. To hell make movies. The songs come from within. How was the letter? start a band and sing together. Who will help me? I can't do it without you, you know. - Masha, do you like the song? - I'm a fan of yours. 01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,059 enough. How much is the ticket to Bali now? Let's go together? We should put a straw here. smells like iron. Don't worry, we will never get away from each other. We can't be apart, because we used to be together for thousands of years, under different names, with different faces and voices. But we are still us. We have always been here and it will always be so. We are eternal. Like the Grand Canyon. Do you understand? We are like the Grand Canyon. Do you understand? Of course I do. We stayed in bed. .:..:.
