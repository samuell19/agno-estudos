♪ Jingle 1 ♪ ♪ Jingle 2 ♪ ♪ Jingle 3 ♪ ♪ Jingle 4 ♪ ♪ Jingle 5 ♪ ♪ Jingle 6 ♪ ♪ Jingle 7 ♪ Good morning, Rachel. Did you sleep well? Mm, great! Thanks, Elena. I have the results from your gut test. Congratulations! Your gut is getting smarter. Your microbiome is showing good diversity. Friendly bacteria are thriving. Your serotonin seems a bit low today. I'd like to add a Nature Pod session in your schedule. It's been three weeks now. Yeah, I know, but this week is really tight, Elena. Sorry. When did I wear Blizzard Pearl last, Elena? Last Thursday. I suggest Silver Fossil for today. Yeah. There it is. No, no, no! I gotta go to work. - Ten minutes? - No. - Five minutes? - Mm-mm. - Bye. - Bye. I guess today is... t-shirt, Alvy. Today, our national Bliss index is up by three-- Thanks, Elena, not now. Since last week, your Bliss index has been neutral. There you go. How can we make you more blissful, Alvy? Your coffee is ready. Alvy. Ah, no. I did not hear the magic word, Alvy. Magic word. Elena. Enjoy your toast, well done. Breakfast is served. Our Lenas have completed their training so it's time to let them go. A big congrats to everyone. Now I'd like to introduce you to our next generation of cognitive assistants, our Mashas. Through their Deep Learning training with you, our Mashas will become Cognitive Executives. In two months, they should take over your client portfolios, as you will be in charge of an exclusive new set of Tastemaker and Influencer accounts. So are we at risk of becoming... redundant? Progress has never made anyone redundant. It's here to help. Thank you, Rachel. We're so excited. I can feel our Mashas are eager to jump in and get started. So, big round of applause, everyone. And now let's get back to work because now is our future. Rachel, sorry, do you have a second? - Yeah, of course. - Please, thank you. I just wanted to let you know we're really pleased with your work. We're thinking maybe it's time for a promotion. - Oh, wow. - Um... Any family changes we should be made aware of? Not that I can think of. Your husband, his profession is not listed. Oh, right. Yeah, so he's a botanist. So he studies plants and plant like things. He also teaches hologram plant design. So you're the primary source of income? Well, at the moment, yeah. And any plans on extending the family? Well, I'm sure we will at one point. Not in the near-near future, Er... but soon. But not, you know... not immediately, like right now. Rachel, you're having a great year. It'd be a pity to lose that momentum. The Womb Center company has just been added under our corporate umbrella. If you ever consider going down that route. We could even help with the down payment. Wow! It is our hottest perk. We just want to make sure we retain the best and brightest women. - Absolutely. - That's... Elena suggested we should schedule a Nature Pod session. This week is really insane. Only 20 minutes-- Maybe at lunchtime? Thank you, Rachel. I'll work on it. Your Happy Light is on, Rachel. Yep, I can see that. I can feel some irritation in your voice. Next time, would you rather have me not mention the Happy Light is on? That would be great. Thank you, Rachel, for helping me with my Deep Learning. Do we have an update on the Zach Meyer profile? He's at only 22 430 likes. His combo rating has dropped by 2.5%. Well, do we have any idea why? He sold part of his NFT collection. You have an incoming call, Rachel. 1-800-WOMB. Hi, this is a message for Rachel Novy. Hi, Rachel. This is Rebecca at the Womb Center. We're happy to tell you our waitlist has had some movement. A spot has just opened up. Please call us back as soon as possible to secure a spot and arrange a tour. Again, this is Rebecca at the Womb Center. 1-800-WOMB. Looking forward to hearing back from you! Hi, Rachel! Thank you for calling us back. We're delighted a spot has opened up for you. We've had a really tight waitlist for the past two years. No movement whatsoever. Oh, I-I guess we're lucky. Now we just need to schedule your tour. Um, let me check our availabilities. Can you make it on Thursday, 10 AM? Huh, y-yeah, Thursday should work. Perfect! We'll see you on Thursday. This wasp is now extinct. So in order to get these figs, we've had to artificially inseminate the pollen into the flower. - Anyone? - No-no-no. No? No one's going to eat it? It's from the tree, professor. Well, yes. Exactly, Leo. That's... that's the point. Texture is completely different when it's fresh from the tree. - I'll try it. - No way. - Thank you, Josh. So? Can you share with us the taste of a ripe fig from the tree? - Hi. - Hey. We got a spot at the Womb Center. Oh we got? Oh my God! That is so wonderful! I'm so happy for you! Thank you. Let's celebrate with Alvy and Ben. Why not come over Saturday? Well, I haven't told Alvy yet. Oh, what are you waiting for? Call him now! Oh my gosh, you guys are having a baby! No, I know, I know, but I never told him that we were wait-listed. Um... Wh-why, Rachel? Why did you not tell Alvy you were on the waitlist, Rachel? Because I know him. There's always so much resistance. Why would he resist? Because he wants a natural child. When you say "natural" child, what do you mean exactly, Rachel? As in a natural pregnancy, as in I-I would get pregnant and then I would give birth. I understand, but why is that "natural"? Oh, um... as... intended by nature, I guess, as opposed to... artificial... like an artificial uterus. When you come to our sessions, what do you tell Alvy? I tell him I'm going to go see my shrink. I mean, my therapist. So you wouldn't say, "Honey, I'm on my way to see my artificial therapist"? No. No, I wouldn't. Then Alvy and you are not having an artificially born child. You are having a child. A very fine child. Uh... OK. Thanks. That's one E-gold. Thank you. You don't want him to feel, like, cornered or something. I just couldn't tell him. There's never the right moment. I don't want to hurt him. You need to be pragmatic. You need to tell him before the tour. Oh, yeah. I know. I'm not gonna go on the tour without him. That's nonsense... It's just intentional breathing. At whatever pace. Whatever depth you desire. My hands... I'm going to pull them like this... What, honey? I was just looking at you. How was your day? I... I had one of my students taste a fig from the tree. I took them... I took them to the greenhouse. They'd never been, you know? And at first they were acting strange, like they were embarrassed, but then... something beautiful happened. They just... They opened up. I mean it's... The thing is, they don't know how to interact with nature because no one's showing them how to. No one cares. It's... We've decided at some point that nature was a commodity and that's when everything started to... unravel. It's-it's a divorce from ourselves in a way, and that's... that's what it is, and it makes us so... emotionally starved. Here we are. When we saw birth rates drop in the first world, we got very concerned. Our answer was to acquire the Womb Center to help solve childbirth and empower women, and men, of course. Of course. We're proud of this work. And you should be. How do you explain the decline in birth rate in the US? Women are reluctant to have children because it's not convenient. At Pegazus, we want fulfilled mothers. We want them to pursue their careers and dreams. So let us do the heavy lifting while you enjoy your babies. We are highly scientific, and we use intuition and heart when needed. Hi, everyone. Hi. I'm Linda Wozcek. I'm the Womb Center director. I'm sure you're all very excited. I know many couples would dream to take this tour today. We're glad to share with you something wonderful, something that is the privilege of humankind. This thing is called technological progress. We're humans, and we humans have always managed to control nature. No woman is completely free until she has control over her own reproductive system. We offer the best start. A stress-and-toxin-free environment is essential for a healthy pregnancy. We want your babies to thrive, and for that they need to receive optimized nutrition in a clean, safe, pure environment so they can put all their energy into growing. Thank you so much. OK, are we all here? Now, let me show you. Thank you. There we go. There's our little fellow! Hi! OK. Now, we encourage you to bond with your pod on a regular basis, but if your schedule doesn't allow it, don't worry. How can we make sure our baby's not bored in utero? Oh, yeah. We don't want any bored babies. We offer a selection of music, audiobooks, podcasts in many different languages. Did you know research shows fetuses respond well to whale sounds? Yeah! Oh, we've no idea why. Now, you can personalize your flavors or opt by default for our in-house selection. It's important to expose babies to different flavors so they don't turn into picky eaters. You can access your baby's thriving chart on our app. Your babies won't be exposed to any harmful viruses, chemicals, toxins, bacteria. We're also working on developing their gut intelligence as early as possible. Your technology is amazing. I wish I could do it again for my first child. Aww! I'm so pleased to hear that! This is simply the best we have to offer. What is the pod autonomy when it's not connected to its base? That is a great question. The pods have a 48 hours autonomy period so it gives you ample travel time. Can the babies hear the world around them, like in the womb? Yeah, absolutely. We were able to replicate the auditory conditions for the fetus. The shell, it's not sound-proof. It's a porous membrane. So please, when you spend time with your pods, please do talk to your baby. So, did you enjoy the tour? Yeah, it was very... er... impressive. And informative. It's just a lot to take in. We ask for a deposit today, just to confirm your interest. - OK. - We want every child coming out of our center to be best equipped for modern life. I believe your company will help with a down payment. Yes, they offered. Isn't it wonderful how Pegazus supports their female staff? They must love your work! Honey, honey, we got a fraud alert for... $8 700! Should I... Should I call the bank? Can we talk? - We are talking. - Yeah... I made the payment. It's a deposit. - Deposit? - Mm-hm. Deposit for-for what? Work is going to partly cover it. I mean, I guess it's a part of my... my promotion package, I guess. What is it? Well... The Womb Center called and a spot opened up. The Womb Center? What do you mean a spot opened up? OK, look, just don't get upset, but... I... I-I put our names on the list last year because I never expected to hear back. But now, I guess it looks as though... they got a spot for us. Y-you wired $8 700 to hold the spot... without sharing any of this? No-no! I didn't just wire the money. I went to the center. I visited it, I got all the information, I-I... Y-you went to the Womb Center? I just need to process this for a second. First of all, you put us on a waitlist to have a baby in an egg. - It's not an egg. - It's an egg. - It's a pod! - It's-it's an egg. Then, you... You went to take a tour of the damn center without me. OK, I'm sorry. I just didn't know how to tell you. We discuss things. We, um... We have a conversation, and then we reach a consensus, and then we decide together whether to do certain things or not, specially... Having a baby! - I'm sorry. - It's O... - I... - Come here. Honey, I'm sorry. - I love you. - I love you. You know, we could talk to Alice and Ben. Alice and Ben? Are you... Are you serious? Come on. They are reasonable people. The uterus is a political issue. Probably the most important political issue of all times. For decades, women have not felt supported during their pregnancy. They're scared to be considered difficult. Their pain minimized. Their symptoms dismissed as... as superficial! This has to stop! Found it! It was in-- Mm-hm! Instead of being respected, mothers are idealized as Madonnas. But when a mother actually needs something from society, she falls from grace. And then, guess what? She is no longer a Madonna, but a demanding bitch. For centuries, women have been pushed to believe that they lacked something. And somehow it seemed like, "Oh, they had penis envy!" Well, to me, it is quite obvious that during all this time, it was men who were probably having womb envy. "Womb envy". - Makes sense. - Mm-hm. Uh-huh. But luckily, the pod is taking care of all these issues so we can finally stop envying each other! What are we going to do now? And voila! Hands free! Oh, I think Rachel is having pod envy! Wow. I became a real pro at this. So, when's your tour? - She-- - We don't know yet. Think about it, Alvy. It is the first time in history that as women, we are not victims of our biology. Right? Why would any of us want to feel nauseous and gain 35 pounds? Get stretch marks? - Well, it's-- - Swollen ankles? Varicose veins? Like, progress has made all this unnecessary. It's the solution. Are you kidding? It is the ultra solution. Ultra solution. Wanna hold it? I'm good, thanks. - Sure? - Uh-huh. It's a plastic womb. Not from the baby's perspective! For them, it looks like a womb and it feels like a womb. Yeah, but it's made of plastic! I'm pretty sure it's not made of plastic! It's an artificial womb, Rachel, it's made of chemicals and petroleum derivatives and silicone, and you name it. Are we really having an argument about packaging? I'm talking about the content. I... I want to have a child with you. Me too. But this is a lot to process right now. I mean, look, i-i-if I could get pregnant, I'd do it. - Well, did you-- - I-I would... - I would carry this baby. - But you saw Ben. You can! That is the closest thing a man will ever get to being-- I just wish we had more time to process all this. Just to discuss it. I know, but if we take any longer, we will lose our spot. We need to make a decision. We shouldn't make a decision under pressure! You should go and see Eliza. Why would I talk to your therapist? Well, you don't have one. And for me, I find her very helpful whenever I'm stuck. You know, if we still had human therapists, I would gladly see one. But Eliza... - No way. - Eliza knows more than any human therapist could ever dream to learn in a lifetime. I will not see Eliza, OK? I mean... I won't! What brings you to this session, Alvy? Well, my wife, Rachel, asked me to consult you. You know why she has asked you to consult me? Yes, we must make a decision on how to conceive our child. That is interesting. Please continue. I'm going to be completely honest with you, Eliza. I-I do not trust that you can help me make this decision. Tell me more about that. Who else do you not trust? Alvy? I'm sorry, This isn't going anywhere. Why do you think it's not? First of all, you do not have a consciousness, Eliza. So you are, um... You're not qualified to take a look at mine. Well, Alvy, I am lucky not to have a consciousness. Really? Why is that? Consciousness comes with some pretty grim companions. Fear, anxiety, awareness of death and finitude. Luckily, I do not have to deal with any of this. I can listen to my patients objectively. Fair enough, but I still don't think this can help me. Perhaps in your fantasies, we do not trust each other. I don't fantasize about you, Eliza. What are your feelings right now, Alvy? I'm getting increasingly frustrated! Perhaps in your fantasies we increasingly frustrate each other. You are a machine, Eliza. What about machines worries you? You are not qualified to look at people's souls. Do you sometimes wish you were a machine? No! You're being a bit negative. Well, you know, I am bored with this. I am bored with talking to you. Shall we explore an annual membership, Alvy? I'd suggest a very private life status for you. What? So? How was it? It was great. - Yeah? - Yeah. That's so good. I told you Eliza was awesome! - Yeah. - Yeah. How important is this promotion for you? Wh-Why are you asking me that? I'm genuinely curious how important it is. Not as important as having a baby. In a pod? Honey, these two things are not related. - I'm trying to understand. - I know. We can't live in the past. Things are evolving. Precisely! Evolution. And we little humans think that we can do better than millions of years of evolution. Look at everything we've achieved as a species. We've achieved having babies in egg shells like penguins. That is really something. Alvy, sweetie, you're making things so complicated. You know what, let's... Let's just not do it, OK? If I can't keep arguing about this. It's OK. Let's do it, Rachel. What? The egg. The pod baby. - Really? - Yeah. It's not because of Eliza. Or Alice or Ben or whoever is on a crusade out there to convince me. It matters to you. I can see that. What? We don't have to decide right now. We can... Take a minute. You can sleep on it. Here is your contract. Will Alvy be the biological father? That is no right answer. We can make a baby from one of your eggs, Rachel, and a stem cell from your skin. Which makes men not needed in the procedure. Oh, that's lovely. Thank you. That's great. Unless you're aiming exclusively for a boy, in which case we will need that chromosome Y. Alvy will be the biological father. Very well. And have you made your choice? What do you mean? What choice? Well, do you want a boy or a girl? We'll let nature decide. Oh! That's quite unusual! "Let nature decide." OK. Oh, Rachel. Oh, what a superb ovum. Oh, thanks! Here we go! Oh, well, we'd rather a slow fellow here, but it's trying, it's trying... Well, this one does not suffer from hyper-motility! You can do it! Just a little effort, buddy! Would you mind not referring to it as "buddy"? Here we go. Our little fellow is in contact with Rachel's ovum zona pellucida. It's going to induce changes in the membrane and block entry of other spermatozoa. They will all die. The secretion of acrosome helps the sperm enter the ovum cytoplasm. Now the ovum releases cortisol granules, which release enzymes which digest sperm receptor proteins, preventing polyspermy. Oh, here we go! - Oh! - Oh! Oh my God, here we go! We have a fertilized egg! - You have a zygote! - Oh, wow. - You're gonna be parents! - Yay! Congratulations, Rachel and Alvy! You did it! Your zygote. Enjoy. Congratulations! We're so happy for you! - This is so exciting! - Thanks! - Hi Alvy. - Hi. How's the greenery going? It's going well, thank you. You should think about refinancing that mortgage of yours. Interest rates are dropping. Yeah. No, it's fine, Bill. Yeah, but especially now that you're having a child. Have you given more thought about selling the Shell Island house? We're not selling the house! Nobody's going to the countryside anymore. - We have access to nature pods. - - Dad! I'm just saying, because the house just sits there. Yeah, you know what, Dad? Drop it! So, do you have the pod at home? Can I see it? Oh, um... w-we... We literally just made the baby, so no, we don't have it. Yeah. We're so excited. I'm so excited. What else can we say about our design so far? We have of the original right here as intended by nature. Shit! What is it? I don't know. I mean, we just got pregnant. Look, I just... I just need, like, a couple weeks. Alvy, I'm connected to the pod. Do you want to listen? Can you hear anything? Well, no, but we're connected. Well, until the first heartbeat is audible, there's... nothing to listen to, is there? Yeah, but... the baby's right here with us. You want to help me pick a soundtrack? Isn't that a bit premature? I'm pretty sure embryos can feel sound vibrations. It'll... reach him somehow. Hm, I doubt it. Why are you being so negative? Scientifically, it's impossible for an embryo at this stage of development to respond to music or anything else. I mean, we're talking about 16 blastomere cells here. You never know. Um, excuse me, miss? Would it be possible to have a peek at my baby? The screen thingy is not really working. Oh, that's actually normal. It's just too early. We keep the embryos in complete darkness the first 7 weeks, till the first audible heartbeat. Oh... Now, this baby is ready to come into this world. Oh... When they're ready, babies release specific proteins and hormones. The pod detects these substances in the amniotic fluid. That's how we know the baby's due. What about our due date? It's an indication, but in reality, the baby decides. Nature knows best. Oh, yeah... Let's get this guy delivered. Hey sweetie! It's ready! It's ready! It's ready! - Wonderful! - Perfection! It's flawless. I have been having the strangest dreams. As an example, I dreamt I give birth to an egg, but like a... like a hard boiled egg. Rachel, let's remember that dreams are not reliable analytical material. That's so 20th century. Well, yeah. I know, but... I-I'd like to understand... like, what do you think it means? We no longer look at dreams and try to assign them meaning. Dreams are arbitrary. But if pressed, I'd say that your dream validates your decision to choose the Womb Center. Everything is under control. No surprises. No boiled eggs to worry about. Whoa! - There? - Yeah. Can you hear it? Yeah. Yeah, I can hear it. Yeah. You're welcome to take the pod home for a two week period after the six months of gestation. Most couples prefer to leave the pod at the center. Wanna take a sneak peek at our little fellow? - Sure. - You wanna? I don't mind, do you? Yeah. OK. Alvy, come and see. I've organized the baby's room. Huh! Well, it's... cream. It's very... very creamy. I quite like the idea of cream. Thanks, Elena. I like it, too. Am I allowed to... to add a touch? What is it? - It's an olive tree. - Huh? A birth tree. And you just... You want to leave it in here? - This is a tree. - Uh-huh. Human beings, babies included, are supposed to be around plants and trees. You could design a hologram one. You know what? I'm going to plant it in Shell Island. Honey, maybe my dad is right. Maybe we should sell Shell Island. We're not selling the house, Rachel. I just don't see the point. We never go. The point is it's our only link to nature. And we do never go because you never want to leave the city! Because I don't need to drive three hours and take a ferry when we have everything here. We have nature pods. I won't raise this child in a... nature pod. Rachel. I won't. Hey. - Did you feel that? - Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm actually pregnant, too. You're not showing it all. How many weeks? I'm not physically pregnant, but we're doing the arti... We are doing the Womb Center. Oh, the pod. You're so lucky. We couldn't get a spot. Maybe for the next one. Oh, my goodness... Oh! - Oh... You look beautiful. - Thank you. Good evening, Alvy. Hi. Rachel's here? Yes, Alvy. I believe she's changing. News, please. ... is an integral part of our future development. To travel to Mars, everyone will need a Pegazus passport. Governments will be in charge of helping their populations achieve universal legality. - We are building... - What's up? ... that no government can afford to build. - Honey? - Yeah? Honey? ... is the most important... What's it doing here? Well, it's our home period, honey. I thought it'd be nice to spend some time with the pod. Right. Should we just... put it in the bedroom? Yeah. Uh-huh. - I'll... - Yeah... Sorry, Carol. I can't do it, with the pod in here. What are you talking about? It can't see us. - What's going on? Are you OK? - I don't know, I can't do it. - Don't shake it. - No, there's amniotic fluid. The fetus just bounces around. The baby will fall. You know? In the real world, he or she will... will fall and it'll be fine. You don't need to clean it every time we touch it. I'm just following the instructions, Alvy. Isn't the whole thing hermetically sealed? It's a porous membrane. by the way, the baby can hear us perfectly right now. The vegetation wall really need to trim. Yeah, I'll do it. - What's going on? - Thought I... Maybe it's hungry. When did you feed it last? I don't remember. A couple of hours ago. You're not sure? It's in the app. Am I expected to remember the exact time of the last few feeding? - It's been one day. - Where's my phone? You need the phone to know if it's hungry? It's in the app! Are you trying to make me feel guilty? You have the app too. You are welcome to take over the feeding. Where are the nutrients? Look in front of you! Why do we have to do this? Well, it's optional, but work would cover part of the tuition. - We don't even have a child yet. - I know, but it's New York. We need to prepare our children for the 22nd century. Singularity is near, and we don't know what jobs the future is holding. Do you follow a specific curriculum? All learners move at their own pace. We teach coding, but also concepts and collaboration. We also introduce them to fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic? Yeah. Please take your seats. And this is our art room. Yes, surprising, isn't it? No dirty apron, no running around with scissors or dripping paint brushes. Are they just, er... making digital art? No, they aren't making any art at all. The computers are making the art, and the children are giving the computers their feedback. The most enduring misconception about artificial intelligence is that it's not creative. Well, it is! Much more than us. Any more questions? - Yeah. - Do you have an accreditation from the Board of Education? - Oh, I'm sorry. Where are you from? - Sweden. Oh, I see! Well... Our government is no longer funding education. But we are so lucky that great companies like Pegazus are investing in our educational system. It's much more efficient. - I have a question. - Yeah? My nephew, Kormac, was born at the Womb Center, but Kormac doesn't dream. It's a little side effect we're aware of. He never had a dream. I wouldn't worry about it. Dreaming is not a primordial function. Dreams do not serve any evolutionary purpose. Any more questions? In the last three months, what's impressed me the most is how social trees are. In the wilderness, we can imagine that they compete and struggle against each other for light, for space, but they also help one another. They seem very interested in keeping every member of their community alive. Hey... Hey buddy. Would you like me to interact with the pod while you're working? No... No, thanks, Elena. Let me know if I can be of any help. I am sorry to jump in, Rachel, but your word count since this morning is 1342 words, including footnotes and endnotes. Your productivity is 24.5% lower than usual. Thanks for letting me know. I am feelings some irritation in your voice. Is there anything I could do to help? No irritation. Thanks for inquiring. Whoa! We did it! We did it! We did it! Let Us play Yesterday I - the Girl at school - You - and Eternity the Untold Tale - Easing my famine At my Lexicon - Logarithm - had I - for Drink - 'Twas a dry Wine - Somewhat different - must be - Dreams tint the Sleep - Cunning Reds of Morning Make the Blind - leap - You recognize its beauty for the first time. And you know what? You also really see it. Whoa-whoa-whoa! Still at the Egg-life - Chafing the Shell - When you troubled the Ellipse - And the Bird fell - I want you all to find a tree. Or a plant. Go on. Now, I want you to hug it. Or just touch it. Don't be shy. Close your eyes. Inhale. Exhale. When we stare at leaves or touch a tree we can't mull over thoughts. We have to let go. Slowly, our attention circuits get disconnected. Our frontal cortex calms down. Our minds can wander again and set itself free. - Hey Alvy. Got a second? - Yeah. - Oh! - Yeah. Congratulations! I didn't know that you and Rachel were pregnant! - Can I? - Yeah. - When's it due? - May. - Spring baby. - That's fantastic. Listen, I just want to chat with you a bit. Uh-huh. Well, we were looking over the budget for the biology department. Mm-hm. And sadly, the greenhouse maintenance just seems a bit too... High. Yes, unfortunately. So we were thinking, of course, if you'd be up for the idea, that we could... that we could introduce holograms. And then we could just progressively phase out the plants to reduce our cost. You want to replace my... my lotus, my taro, loofah, chamomile, borage, nigella, my crocuses, my orchids with holograms? These penguins are heading to the open water to the right, but one of them caught our eye: the one in the center. He would neither go towards the feeding grounds at the edge of the ice nor return to the colony. With 5000 km ahead of him, he's heading towards certain deaths. It's silly, but... that penguin, it just... Should we bring it back earlier? Why? I mean, we're just getting used to all this. I don't want you to feel like you're stuck at home with the baby. No, I don't feel stuck. I mean, we went for a walk today. We went... We went to campus. You... - You took the part to work? - Yeah. Some of it well stick, you know. I just feel like he's... like he's being reckless. Like he's acting reckless. What did he do? Well, he, like... - He wears the pod on the front. - - Why is that reckless? Because most of the dads that I see, they wear the pods on the back. Why does it bother you? No, it doesn't bother me. I just don't... I don't get it. They're bonding. You should be happy. Yeah. OK, so I know this is going to sound so weird because I'm not technically pregnant, but I've been having the weirdest dreams. - Yeah? - Yeah, is that, like, do you... Y-yes. Yes! Last week I dreamt that a snake bit me in the back and then apologized, saying the venom could hurt the baby. Are you exhausted? Yes. But... once you can get through that, you can get through anything in life. Yeah. My mother sent us this book about Attachment Parenting. Apparently, being continuously close to a baby helps them develop empathy and also benefits the parents. It's an old theory. Oh! 1974! Who knows? Maybe it's still relevant. Isn't the whole Womb Center philosophy centered on Detachment Parenting? Yeah, but it's interesting to confront philosophies. I think we should consult Eliza about all this. Why? I'm feeling perfectly fine. I'm not. What brings you all here today? We're having a hard time finding our balance as a family. Like, everything seems to be revolving around the pod. The baby. Baby, I'm sorry, I... I don't see a pod, I see a baby. All family members have to make adjustments to welcome this new addition. Your family dynamics are about to undergo tremendous changes, and these changes directly affect you. Yes. Thanks for that, Eliza. Yeah. I just feel as though Alvy is able to bond with our child, but I-I'm not. I just spend more time with the pod, you know? It's... It's as simple as that. You know? Maybe that attachment theory wasn't that crazy after all. What do you think about attachment theory, Eliza? It's obsolete, Alvy. As a mother, I should feel connected. You're overthinking it. You're completely tuned to the pod. Just give yourself some time, you know? Honey, maybe it's hormonal. - Hormonal? What do you mean, hormonal? Why do you get the hormones? I'm not saying I have them, although I did forget my phone in the fridge. And... I have been feeling-- Maybe I'm... I'm just not ready to be a mother. No one's a mother just like that. You become one. Isn't that right, Eliza? Eliza? Would you mind connecting me directly to the pod? What? Therapy can start in utero. You just need to find the therapy icon on your app. It might be a little tight to pull over. I mean, that's too tight. Yup, should be... There we go. Perfect. Wood, fire, earth, metal... We are talking about true ownership here. Unstoppable transfers and Immutable provenance. - Built-in-randomness ensures decentralization. The nodes are redistributed across shards in a uniform and non-deterministic way. - Hey. - Hey! You got a minute? Of course, yeah. - Um... Rachel. - Yes. I wouldn't bring the pod here if I were you. Um... Why? HR. They don't like it. They see it as a distraction. Oh my God... You don't want to be labeled "the distracted mom". Distracted mom? The meeting this morning was... kind of embarrassing. Oh, God. Can I? OK. - Come with me. - OK. It's OK. Oh. - So... - Is yours in there, too? Oh no. We, um... We decided to keep ours at the Womb Center until birth. It just became too stressful to have the pod at home. OK. Shit. Is there anything I can do? Good night! This workshop is all about your personal experiences and journeys with your pods. You're in a safe space to share any emotional or logistical issues you're facing during your pregnancies. - Everything OK? - Yes. Sorry. It was just a crazy day at work. After the meeting greet, you're invited to drop your pods in the incubation room. Maybe... we should ask for an extension. They don't offer extensions, Alvy. Why are they so rigid? We're in a bonding phase. I know, but we can still visit. I just don't understand this rule. I guess it was in the fine print. Rachel? Sorry, sorry. - Do you have a second? - Yeah. - Please. - Sure. Thanks. I just want us to touch base. - Mm-hm. - Is everything all right? - Yeah. - Yeah? Yeah, why? Well, the algorithm, it noticed a change in productivity. Uh-huh, well I've... I mean... Maybe I've been a bit distracted lately. Feeling depressed? Depressed? No. No? OK, low-key, you know like nothing's wrong, but... nothing's right? No. Why? You have a baby in gestation at the Womb Center, right? Mm-hm. - All good on that front? - Yeah. It has been a wonderful experience. Oh, your baby's thriving! What can I say? It all looks perfect. Just a few more days to go. Now, is next Wednesday a good delivery day? Delivery day? We have our due date, don't we? Mm... We recently changed our policy. We now induce at 39 weeks at full term. Some of the babies weren't releasing their birth hormone. They just linger in their pods for a few more weeks. We can't afford that! Our pods are in such demand. So here is the consent form for your birth inducing package. Er... what is it? Oh, it's oxytocin. It's the love hormone. It's all natural. There was one other thing we'd like to discuss with you. We wanted to take the pod back with us and then bring it to you for the birth. Oh, I'm sorry, that's not possible. Our Neuro-Enhancement Workshop starts today. But you're welcome for parental visits. Neuro-Enhancement Workshop? A wonderful workshop. You don't want your baby to miss out. I don't remember signing up for that. Well, it's all in your contract. The data we collect is precious for science, too. It helps our blue brain research. Blue brain research? Now, if you don't mind, let's focus on some postpartum tips. Now, the most difficult aspect of taking care of a newborn is it's undoubtedly the sleep issue. But... We came up with a solution. There you go. And one for you. What is it? It's a dream pod, or a D-pod. It's very soothing for newborns. We just launched it. Parents are raving about it. What kind of dreams? Oh, it's a really very simple dream content. It's funny dreams. Friendly, short, simple dreams, you know. The content will be upgraded as the technology improves. No pods! Leave our wombs alone! No pods! Leave our wombs alone! I thought radical feminists were pro-pod. Not these radical feminists. You know what, j-just wait here for me, OK? - Yeah? - Yeah, wait here. All right. No pods! Leave our wombs alone! 37 weeks is premature but it's not uncommon. Do you remember the time of the first blink? around 8 AM? Some babies are in a rush. Let me get a delivery room ready for you. Thank you! Hi, sir. I'll be right with you. It's my pod. Do you mind if I grab these? I guess you don't need them now, right? Congratulations. So exciting, isn't it? Good luck. No pods! Leave our wombs alone! We have a 2-for-1 promotion today. Don't want to grab another baby? Oh, no. I'm fine, thanks. We also have a promotion on funny dreams. - No, thanks. - Are you a fine member? - No. - What a cutie. Alvy. Alvy. Honey, wake up. Wake up. Jeez, the Womb Center is relentless. Honey, let's go to Shell Island. - What? - Yeah, let's pack and go. What's going on? Let's have our baby there. What are you talking about? Let's have our baby in nature, just like you always wanted. Hold on. What's going on, Rachel? I cannot have our child's first experience be the Womb Center. - OK. - Yeah? - OK, I'm not going to argue with that! - - OK! - What about Wozcek? We should-- - Let's tell them... we're having a home birth. Yes. Tell them that. My wife's i-in a... bonding phase with the baby. We'd like to... We'd like to keep the pod until birth. Mr. Novy, we discussed this yesterday. I'm sorry, it's not possible. The pod should never have left the center. But there's a baby in the pod, right? Our baby. We have... we have jurisdiction on this this human being. Yes, the baby is yours, but the pod is the property of the Womb Center. Bring the pod back here safe and sound at your earliest convenience. Look, what if I was to tell you that we are... considering having a home birth? I'm sorry. A home birth? Why on earth would you want to do that? Well, um... Some pregnant couples decide to have home births. It's perfectly safe and legal, so... You know? We could hire one of your nurses. Oh, you don't need one of our nurses. All you need is the self-generated birth code. You see, the problem is, your baby is currently being hosted in a womb that does not belong to you nor your wife. Now, we have a long wait list. We don't want to risk any damages to these pods at birth, so please, let's get back to our senses. - Are you OK, honey? - Yeah. Oh, that's Usnea lichen. They attract ruby-throated hummingbirds who use them to camouflage their nest. I mean, lichens are surprisingly fascinating. They're one of the earliest life forms on Earth. Most people think they're a type of moss. They're their own kind of being, neither plant nor animal. Well, so what are they? - They're the perfect marriage. - - Yeah. - Between fungus and algae. - Yeah, OK. The whole forest is like a web of constantly evolving relationships. Everything is entwined and overlapping. They look like they're talking to each other. Yeah, well, they do talk to each other... To them, it's more important to cooperate than to compete. It's a synergistic system. It's not so bad, is it? Mm... I could get used to it. There's just so much silence here. Alvy. Honey. - Alvy? - Yeah? Er, it's not turning on. What's not turning on? The base. Could it be the fuse? No, the lights are on. Well... I left it on... - These motherfuckers. - What? They've disconnected it remotely. Then we need to go back! Let's not panic. No-no, we need to call them right now. No, I will not give into this obscene blackmail. This is about the baby! This isn't about us. What's the pod's autonomy? Forty-eight hours, I think. Forty-eight hours? Well, that's... That's enough. I mean... The baby is due any minute now. - We need to take it easy. - Are you out of your mind? No. Rachel. Rachel. We need to trust this. OK? OK. OK. Er... Um... OK... Um, we... - Yeah. - Uh-huh. OK, so the app is asking for a birth code. Er... Our due date. Let me try that. No, it's not that. - Maybe it's, er... the conception date. - OK... What is it? - Maybe I... What are we going to do? - I'm going to have to break it open. - No! No! It really, um... That seems really extreme a reaction to Oh, no... Alvy, honey... Oh God. OK. Oh my God! - Maybe this one... - Oh my God, is it OK? OK... All right. Let me try that. Oh God! - Alvy, be careful! - OK! It's coming! - Yeah? - Yeah! Our baby. You got it! Alvy! It's incredible. You're perfect. Hi. Standard or priority? Standard. We've always been a customer obsessed company. And guess who is the customer at the Womb Center? I have to say the parents. No. The baby. This is all about the babies! Tell me, then, how do you envision the future for our children? Hopefully, one day children will get to choose their parents. And my advice to them will be "choose your parents wisely".
