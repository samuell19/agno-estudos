I see it everyday. The illusion of love. You would be surprised at the percentage of... I see the ones who will start being disappointed. The ones smack in the middle of disappointment. The ones making an effort not to be disappointed. It's part of my job to see these things. Sex, family... Hey! Couples love. You learn a lot. Okay, everything looks fine. Take her, for instance... do you know where the father of her kids is? Neither does she. ...looking good, which is great. She waited years for the perfect love of her life, who ended up coming Ina frozen sperm tube. And these two look adorable, don't they? Not so much, no. So many people fundamentally mistaken about their lives. Chasing after the fairy-tale, settling for what they can get. It's exhausting. Because they can't admit one simple, devastating truth: Love, actual love... is, at best, improbable. It's not meant for everyone. It is the privilege of some lucky few. And if you find it, you'll end up losing it. So it's better if you accept the thing for what it is most times. Were you waiting for someone here? Uh, no. Sure. Sit down. Learn to make it quick. Learn to make it fun. Just learn to love that it ends as fast as it begins. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh. Wow. Oh, wait, wait, wait. What? What? I love you. Okay. Okay. Okay? Mm-hmm. Mmm! God, yes! Okay. ♪ Hey, hey ♪ ♪ This is the story of your life ♪ ♪ Soon enough ♪ ♪ We'll see the sunrise ♪ ♪ The changing tides ♪ ♪ The rest will come ♪ ♪ Better believe we're just beginning now ♪ ♪ This is the part where your life gets back ♪ ♪ Gets back together now ♪ ♪ Together ♪ ♪ Whoa ♪ ♪ Whoa-oh-oh ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Hey, hey ♪ ♪ You got your head on straight ♪ ♪ There's no frustration now ♪ ♪ No thoughts provoking this ♪ ♪ Your time to learn and live ♪ ♪ See in your turning now ♪ ♪ You'll learn to let it go ♪ ♪ Dawn's breaking over night ♪ ♪ Sweet dreams now ♪ Mom... is this what I get forgiving you a key? How do I look? Hmm? You're wearing white? Of course. The priest will not approve. On the contrary, he loved it. Is that Clara? What'd she think? She's shocked it's white. I mean... Yep. What did Dad say? Nothing. He can't see it yet, it's bad luck. Come on! You've already lived together for forty years. But now they suddenly believe in marriage. Remember when you got married? We don't need belief, we have empirical proof. Your grandpa would be so happy to see me finally getting married... by a priest and everything. He died so scared you both were going to hell... ...for being born out of wedlock. No worries, we can still go to hell for some other things. Ay! Go take a shower, you smell like frat house. Yummy! And we have a fitting for your bridesmaid dress. That's why I came to I.A. I can't, I have a consult and a due date. It's Saturday. Some babies are born on a Saturday... It's like they don't even care about my weekend. Hey! Where did you sleep? I was out last night and stayed out. I didn't know you planned to ambush me with mom and white ruffles. You were out naked? Not initially, it developed that way. I can't believe our parents are getting married before you do. That's usually how it goes, they're the weird ones. I also can't believe that a woman with your mind and your legs can't scare up a date for the wedding. Yesterday's guy wasn't good even for that? Yesterday's guy was barely good for what I wanted him for yesterday. You can't keep sleeping with men you don't want to see again, even to get your clothes back. There's not much left to see. Specially if you're out the door at dawn. I've been in love. I know what it is. So I can easily recognize what it is. It's been a million years, sis. Eight. You have to give it a chance. Why? Because I'm old and should - start thinking about settling? Because you need someone to go places with. Get a move on, otherwise the bride won't be happy. Until she sets you up with one of the Guadalajara cousins. And they're the hands-on side of the family. Just find someone pretty. And if he's Mexican, she'll count it as her wedding gift. Someone pretty and Mexican... ...I can do that. Push, push, push! Okay! There we go! Thanks! Congratulations. Well done! Is he okay? He's fine. He's great. Okay. The brand-new baby boy, huh? Congratulations! Hmm? What? I'm just here to pick up the charts for Leslie. I was just in the room with you and Mrs. Pecanzas. I know. Mm-hmm. The delivery room. Thanks. What'd your boyfriend do? Hmm? Excuse me? Uh, or girlfriend. It's... Well, someone has sent you a million flowers. They must've done something. It's the... arrangements. Right. Yeah. Uh... no. No, no boyfriend. No, these are sample centerpieces for my parents' wedding. Yeah, I have to pick one. Maid of honor. They're renewing their vows? That's great. No, no. Brand-new vows. Yeah, they never got married. They were hippies in the '70s, and now that they've been happy and together for 40 years, they need fresh, new ways to... rub it in. I'm sorry. No, it's...! Mm! Yeah. Hmm. You're pretty. Excuse me? Are you Mexican in any way? Ay-yi-yi. We're so late. We are so late. It's okay. My mom's gonna kill me. Oh, no, you don't need that. We're crossing an international border. Oh, yeah, I know. You're gonna need that on the way back, but... So, they don't care who comes... But we could be anybody. No. They can sense that you're a harmless soul. Yeah, I mean, and that's very accurate of them. I am. But, you, on the other hand, you could be... What is... Come on! Good afternoon. Hi. Something to declare? No. Go ahead. Oh, hey. Yeah. It's fine. Thanks. Thanks. And thanks for coming, by the way. Thank you for inviting me. Listo. I'm driving on the way back. Wow! That's, uh... That's one hell of a view! Look at that. Yeah, I bet you don't have this in Australia, huh? We do, it's just, like... It's nice to see what comes second, you know? Oh! Um, oh, uh, what's the name, again? Jacinta. Jacinta. Yeah, your grandmother's name was Jacinta. Uh-huh. And she was born in Sonora. Sonora. And she... Oh! Okay. Easy, easy. She, uh... met an Aussie in Texas. Aussie in Tex... Right, right. Okay. We can give her an easier name, if you like. Can you handle Maria? Please, be more condescending while you're making ridiculous requests. Oh! Come on. Can you help me with that? Yeah. Yeah. What? Nothing. No, you're just a remarkable ugly woman. Aunt Clarie! Bobs! So nice to see you again! Oh, you brought a date! Yep. Mama's gonna be thrilled! What's up, man? This is not gonna go off. It will go off. We don't want that defeatist attitude, kid. Okay, here we go. Big breath. Yup. Ee! Yay! Oh, thank you. Hello. God, I hate you so much! You look gorgeous! Wait, no... I vote out. Yeah? Yeah. Okay. Ahem. Hello! Hi. He's not Mexican. No, but he has a Mexican grandmother named Jacinta. Jacinta, yes, I did. That's right. Yeah. First few times I met the family, I had a Mexican grandmother, Timothea. Yes! I miss her very much. He's kinda pretty. Thanks. So are you. No fair, Dad. When will you learn to speak Spanish like him? As soon as your mom starts fasting on Yom Kippur. Good luck, Dad. This is backwards, isn't it? I, Eva, take you, Francisco... to be my husband, because... well, you're my best friend. And look at everything we've built together. This house. Our gorgeous daughters. And everything is perfect, because you had something to do with it. Mrs. Barren, I love you so much... we've had a good long run. I'm delighted we're now ruining it with marriage. May we have the rings, please? So here's to having an official document that states we're not bastards. That bad? Daniel? Ee! It's a pleasure to see you again! I cannot believe you're here, kid! Likewise. You too. Daniel, welcome! Congratulations! You wanna make a run for it? Yes. Yes. Yeah? Right. Glad to see you, too. Clara! Clara! Daniel? Hey! Daniel! Hey! What are you...? What are you doing here? Here you are. I saw the announcement on Eva's Facebook and... I had to come. I'm sorry. No, no. I couldn't send you an invitation, your email bounced. Yeah... I figured. Did you? Right... You didn't figure maybe I didn't want you here? So... when did you get back? Last time Abby heard from you, you were in Yucatán, right? I was there, for a while. Then I went to Peru. Aw. Yes, it was great. And... I've been back in I.A. for about four months, now. Ah! Right. And you didn't let anyone know? I didn't... I, um... I didn't. I didn't know how to... I just don't know. I'm sorry. Why are you apologizing to me? You don't have to. No. I mean... You know what? Um... Hi. Uh, I'm, Asher Grace. Oh, God. Hi, nice to meet you, Asher. How are you? Daniel, this is Asher Grace. Asher Grace. You're a long way from home, aren't you? Well, Australia is... You're from Australia? ...four, fif... Seventeen hours away, yeah. Oh, wow. Well, he does... He has, um, a Mexican grandmother named Jacinta. Really? Yeah. No, he doesn't. No, he doesn't. Nice try, though. Well, he does speak great Spanish, though. It's uncanny. Yeah. Nice to meet you, man... truly. My pleasure... truly. Anyway, we were just gonna, uh, see what table we were gonna sit at. Um... yeah. Where are you gonna sit? Yeah. I don't know, but since I'm crashing the wedding, probably at your table. Oh, okay. Yeah. Maybe I'll take your seat! I'm just kidding. This guy, you know, he's, like, deformed because of the accident, exposed fracture. Then he looks at me, looks at the syringe, and goes, "Mm, you know what, doc? It's not that serious." He just walk... Stands up and storms out of the clinic! It was... So, you're with Doctors Without Borders? Yeah. Ah. And you like it? Oh, I love it. Yeah, you know, I get to meet a lot of people, see wonderful places. I like to move around. Of course you do. Well, I really believe that if you stand still too long, Then your life starts living you. It should always be the other way around. Wow. Ladies and gentlemen, please hold your breath for more Life Reflections with Adventure Daniel. I'm serious. Oh, I know, trust me. You do not have to convince any of us of how hard it is for you to stay put. Play nice, Clarita. What? I'm sorry. No, I mean, you say the wrong thing, he'll disappear for another decade! Un otra... No, seriously, I think it's wonderful, all the things you've seen and done. Hmm. Mom is proud of you. I'm just... I don't know. I'm just very happy to be here now. Mm! I love this song. I remember. Screw you, you remember. It'll just be a sec. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So, being a doctor, is that pretty fun for you? What? Nothing. I'm just looking at - you. I haven't seen you in a million years. Eight. Eight. And? You're an old man. Okay. Pile it on, come on. What else? What? No, that's it. You look great, you always looked great. You too. You look great. Always. Always? Since always. Even in a bridesmaid's dress my mom picked out? And Abby? You look great even holding hands with a little Australian. Don't start. What? It's not easy, really... Not all beauty would hold up to a challenge like that. Only yours. You're tremendous! Oh, Daniel. You look just the same. Yeah? Where it counts you look exactly the same. My butt? Right here. It's one of my favorite places in the world, you know? And yet you haven't visited in a long time. I've done nothing but miss it. Liar. Oh, God. Pay no attention to this. It has nothing to do with reality. Come on. I'm so sorry about all of this. Don't... Do not... Don't be silly. We all have one of those. Come on. Yeah? Yeah. That's the saddest thing I've ever heard. Hey! Clara's probably up at the house. Oh, no, I was looking for you guys. Why is he back, you know? All smiles! Hugging people! I mean, we haven't even seen him in years. Decades, almost, and suddenly he's still family? It's just wrong. But he's not... family, is he? What? He's not actually family, though, is he? You're disgusting. No! Well, I'm not. Ah, good. No, I'm making sure you're not disgusting. If you... Because... No, truly, I was... Yeah, you know... Do you want to... tell me about it? Well... Ahem. Hmm. For a split second, he... could've been my husband, and... then he just wasn't. Got it. Arriba! We should go. Blushing bride awaits. Yeah. Clara, where were you? We were chatting. But where? You warming up for the dance-off? Don't practice too... I want to see some of these practice... He's been stretching. Yeah. Thank you very much. I have indeed. You just wait and see. Hi. Hello. Is, uh, Dr. Barron in yet? Does she know what this is regarding? Yeah. Yeah, it's, um... We work togeth... Uh, occasionally we'll work together. Um, and she wanted to talk, uh, strategy. You know what? Just go in. Thank you. Morning. Hi. Okay. Hi. Hi. Hey, so I was, uh... I was thinking that maybe tonight, you and I could go on a proper date, you know, with dinner and tablecloths and such. Asher, you're really sweet, seriously, thank you so much for coming to the wedding and putting up with all the... "Aah!" but, uh, yeah. No, this is... It's not happening. Why not? Uh, well, you work for me. Yeah, well, I don't at all, actually, so that's... Still, I don't date anyone in the hospital. But we already dated. Am I wrong? No, that was just sort of like a... Emergency, you know, not a date. Clara. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I really wish I liked you. I really do, but... I don't. Why not? Why not? Come on, let me know. This is... No, screw the date. I'm interested now. Okay, um... What's wrong with me? Well, you're just... You're not my type. Ah, because I'm too attractive? Gotta get this sorted. You're not the first to say... No, no, seriously, look at me. You're not the first person to say this to me. Okay, fine. Many, many women. Okay, fine, it's the... Crocs. You wear Crocs with cartoon pins in them. I'm in Peds. The kids like them. Kids also like to eat their own bodily fluids. Okay, yeah, no, you're right. The Crocs are gone. Is that it? Done. Oh, they're gone? That's it? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No, now there's the fact that you're willing to change your personality to get a girl to like you. Wow. that was easy. Um... All right, yeah, no, I, uh... I get it. Yeah, I'm sorry. It's about, um... It's about that guy, right? You wish you liked me, but I'm not him, so therefore you can't. Hey, why aren't you with him, hmm? You know, apart from the fact that he's a self-important arsehole, which, I assume, only makes him more attractive. He's bad for me. How so? He leaves. I thought you'd like that. Saves you the trouble. You don't know me. I'm... I'm... Hey. I'm trying to change that, Clara. Let me. Um, I have a patient. I'm sorry. There he is. Everything looks good. God, he's so handsome. Isn't he? Look. Beto... Beto, look at him. He's our little Clark. Clark? Like Superman. He looks happy, doesn't he? Doesn't he? Beto... Doesn't he look happy? He doesn't look anything. He looks happy. Okay, he looks happy. I talk with him a lot, Doctor. Whenever I'm frustrated, or angry, or I just wanna... just... I talk to Clark and I just open my heart to him. Good thing he can't hear, right? So it's less inappropriate. He hears me, he's not like his dad that way. Hi, sis. Hey, are you at your bar? Yeah. Good. What do you mean, good? I have a bar. I'm so going to hell. Stay there for a bit, okay? Why? Because... I'm your sister and I command you. What? What is it? Are you crying? Why is he back? Hang in there, alright? He won't stay. I'm going home, bye. No, no... wait just five minutes! You leaving so early? Hi! Hey! Hi. Hi! How are you? I'm good! Okay. Okay. My sister is the best. It's good to see you, too. You really are pretty, aren't you? Ohh... you're drunk. No. Yeah. Here. There we go. This is amazing! Yeah. Oh, yeah, well, I... I didn't do it, so... Oh, yeah, I was gonna say, it screams designer ex-girlfriend at me. Mm. Your bedroom's weird. It's like Martha Stewart got tired when she got to the door. Oh, you're one of those really funny drunks. Mm! Ho ho! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Here, come. All right. Okay. Mm. Just sleep. Mm. What? I'm taking the couch. You're blue-balling me? Good night. Seriously? Sleep tight, Doctor Barron. Morning. Morning. Now, how you feeling? Why did you bring me here? You wouldn't tell me where you live. Oh, God. I'm sorry. It's okay. Come on. Come here. It's okay. And... you know, maybe, I like you, I don't know, a little bit, something, I don't know. Mm. I'm sorry I'm being a jerk. It's just... No, you have a knack for it. It's that guy, Daniel. I'm so pathetic. I have done nothing but try to forget him since he left, and then he shows up, and that's it. All he needs to do, appear, and I'm gone. I get it. Do you? Yeah. Ohh... That's intense. Yeah, right? And this apartment. Everything... some people never leave, but they can make room for others, the right others, if you let them in. If I let them in? Correct. What is this, then? Is this not me letting you in? Maybe. Admit that you like me. Bruised egos are rough. No, see, you like me. Say it. Wow, look at this Aussie boy lecturing me on love. It's not a lecture. But in reality you're just fishing for compliments. I am not fishing... "Oh, you're beautiful." Thank you, yes, finally. "You're just the most amazing Aussie I've ever met!" Okay, okay... Yeah? Okay. I like you. Okay. Wow, I say I like you, and... you immediately put out. If I'd have known it was that easy... Shh, shh, shh. I would've just... Stop talking. Dr. Barron? Hi. Um, I'm here to, uh, pick up a file or something? Lisa is just decorative when it comes to you, isn't she? Well, she's not exactly high-tech security. How are you? I'm all right. How was your day? It was good. Oh! Mm mm mmm! Tonight. Mm-hmm? Dinner. Tablecloths. All of the above. God, you are obsessed... Finally, hmm? ...with tablecloths. They are the marker of civilization. You coming? Not here tonight. I'm going to my parents' for a long weekend. Oh, you're going to check on their marital bliss, huh? Uh, sorry, this is just a little... It's gonna be that much fun? Nothing's that much fun. No, we go once every few months to the beach, And we play games. My dad loves playing games. It's really fun, actually. It does sound fun. It sounds very fun. I'd invite you. Would you? Uh, yeah, it's just that my parents... Okay. No, I'd love to go. I have a little bit of an issue inviting people... I was at their wedding! No one thought they would ever see you again! Oh, okay. Including me, so... Oh, okay. Oh, wow, yeah. Just... That honesty thing you've got, you can turn that down whenever. No, truly. Seriously... I wanna give this a chance, and I don't want to bring in the whole band yet. Is that okay? Yeah, it's fine. I have to work this weekend, anyway. Then why are you bothering me? That's why I came in here, to tell you I won't make it. You're being obnoxious. Get out. Obnoxious. No, you mean "attractive." You're bothering me. No, no, no, in English it's "attractive." It's okay. Fuck you. Ow! Oh, God! That's... never mind. That gives me a great idea. Don't look it up. Hey, Bob! Hey. Hi sis, how are you? You look beautiful. You look weird, sis. Happy. So the Aussie works is what you're saying? So much... you have no effing idea. Thanks to me. And don't say "eff" I front of Bobby. Because it's short for screw. That can only be Daniel's car. Three eights. No! Hi! There's no getting rid of you is there? I miss your mother. What can I tell you? Anyone who's playing, get in now. Bobs, you're with me, okay? You're gonna help me get all of Daniel's money, your uncle Daniel. I've been waiting for this moment many years. Did you finally learn how to play? Every game. Okay, here we go.

Uh... I know you work tomorrow, but you can come the next day, or whenever you can. Um, the address is saved on your Waze, I think? We used your phone, right? Those things got saved? Anyway, it's pretty much a straight line from the border. Oh, and don't forget your passport. If not, you're gonna stay here forever. Tsk. Okay. Well, see you soon. Hopefully. You can call me if, uh, you get lost, you know, or you can just... You can text me, as well. Okay! Bye. Morning, sunshine. Don't judge me. Everything's so quiet I thought I was alone. Everyone went to that beach Francisco likes. No! Why didn't they wake me? I love that trail. Did you really just wipe my spit off? You wanna catch up? No, no! Stop. Clarity! Ay. Both in Spanish What? Hop on. Never in a million years. Please... Do it. Ready? Ready. Aah! Ha ha! That's it! People stop coming up cause it's colder, but I love it. Makes me think of... What? I dunno... family. You know what I think about a lot? How to dress without people noticing you think about it a lot? In your first apartment in I.A. I swear... I've never felt that kind of heat again in my life. Seriously, those sheets you had, that stuck to you... I lived in the Amazon. I wasn't that hot. And that dry dirt smell. That place was a death trap. You managed to get out alive. Sometimes I'm not sure why I left. You didn't fit standing in the shower. No, idiot, I mean... Yeah, yeah... You wanted to do more... see more. Don't tell me you regret it cause I don't believe you. No, no, I don't regret it. But I should have forced you to come with me. Force me? You didn't even invite me. You wouldn't have come. Would you... have come? Nah. No. I wouldn't have. What's the name of the boy you're seeing? Don't be a jerk. I'm just asking. Yeah. You're asking like a jerk. No, I just... I don't really see you together. You don't? No... he's not your type. What do you know? I know. I know you, people don't change. He's not your type. I'm trying him on for size. There... he's too small for you. He's good. He's sweet and good. He's a Koala! You're dating a Koala. Shut up. He's just easy... Easy going, easy to be with... easy on the eye. Easy on the eye? A lot. So, so... I don't wanna talk about this anymore. Why not? With you, I don't wanna talk about this with you. Okay. So what about you? What? We've established you're not getting any younger. Am I right? That's for sure. You haven't found anyone who seemed good enough for a first wife yet? No. Really? No one? No. Only you, but you're with koala. Besides, you already were my first wife. I don't remember you as my lawfully wedded anything. What's a wife? Family, home... You're my first home. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. First homes are meant to be left. Come on, smooth guy. Time to go. Hey! About time! How was your morning? It was fine. Fine, fine? You and Daniel talked? Why is he here, mom? He came back. He came back to Los Angeles, why is he here? He invited himself. I wonder why. Mother... Stop encouraging her. But why? I can't help it if I'm happy to see him. When I hug him it's like I'm hugging Clara ten years ago. He's a time in her life. Which time? The happy-in-love time or... the crying-herself-to-sleep- because-he-left time? The way Daniel made you laugh... just can't forget it. It made the entire house shake. Laughter that could make you fly. Oh yeah, they flew all night. Ay! My coffee! ...face started melting off. And if they want to know About your past Telling a lie will be required Tell them that you Came from a strange world So you don't know how to cry You don't know about love And you have never loved And if they want to know About my past Another lie will be required I will tell them that I Came from a strange world That I don't know of pain That I triumphed in love And I've never cried We are incredibly talented. Ay yi yi! Sorry. Listen. A lot goes on now that didn't the last time you saw me naked. I know. No. I don't mean in life... I mean these kinda things. Look. You wanna check out my washboard? Really? Let me see. Look. That's horrible. Mm... She's your girlfriend. She's... No, stop, I got it. Hold on. Just imagine yourself standing there... You have no idea how it feels, Clara! You can't imagine... You're looking the other way and... No, stop, I got it, yeah. I don't want to love you. Why do I still love you? You have no choice. And you? Me neither. We will always love each other. Even if we're apart. That's it. That's it that we love each other? Or that's it that we'll be apart? Morning. Hey... What are you doing up so early? Max snores. Max? Wake up. Hey, wake up. Let's have sex. Max? Sex. Come on. Hmm. What? No, wait. Yeah, yeah. Yeah! Too late! Let's do it. Oh, man. Oh, no... Clara, hi. Just letting you know I got your message, and I'll be there tonight, okay? See you soon. Hi, Lisa, it's Dr. Barron. Could you do me a favor? Could you please call Lilly and Beto Alvarez and tell them that I can see them today, after all? Yes, I'll be there in three hours. Okay. The guy hasn't hurt you enough, you have to let him crush you completely? You're being very dramatic and nosey as hell. What are you wearing? I have to see a patient in I.A. When I woke up he was gone. To the kitchen. I don't care. I need to go. I need to take a breath. And also, I called Asher and I asked him to come. Now he's not answering and I need to go stop him. You asked Asher to come with Daniel here? Before. Before what? Daniel was here before us. Before, yesterday. I called him to neutralize Daniel. Asher is a great Daniel-neutralizer. Right, and who's going to neutralize him? Ill be back tonight. Alone or with the neutralizer? I don't know. I can do this Abby, I swear. I will make it until he leaves again which I'm sure won't be long. But I need backup. I'm getting backup. And I need your car. Hi. I'm Dr. Barron. I'm looking for Dr. Grace. He's a resident down here. I know who he is. He's not here. Um, are you sure? 'Cause he said he would be... I'm sure. He asked for the shift off. Annoyed the crap out of me. Okay. This is Asher Grace. Message, please. Mm... Well... So far so good. Looks like Clark's been having nothing but good times. We've been working out together. Together you and Beto? No, me and Clark. That's safe, right? Exercise? Of course. As long as it's not high impact and you feel good after. Keep it up. Cool, cool. Beto's never been one for exercising. You wouldn't know to look at him but... his belly is as big as mine, but for no reason. Between that and the hair, well... You know what, Lilly? This is none of my business, but... you're having a kid with the man, you shouldn't talk to him that way. And Beto, stop rubbing that shirt! Whatever's on it is not coming out right now so maybe, just... I've known you for a long time. You have good hearts, you used to be in love and you had the potential to make remarkably decent parents. But if you keep this crap - up, which you're great at by the way... the only thing you'll have potential for is scarring a brand new human being for life, it's not his fault his parents can't stand each other. So sort yourselves out together or stay the hell apart. 'Cause bringing a child into this thing you have now... Mm-mm. Is not great. Okay? Okay? Okay, okay. Yes. Wonderful. Your visit's on me today. Why not? Watch it, idiot! Sorry! Asher! Clara. What are you doing here? I'm literally on my way to your parents' house. I, uh, had a patient, and I was looking for you. But you're not answering your phone, and you're not at work when you say you will be, so... Clara, I can explain. Uh, don't. Uh, I got to go. I have to go to my parents' for dinner. Yeah, well, let's go. Uh, no. No. Are you uninviting me to the family weekend? Yes. Uh-uh. You don't want to come, trust me. I do. I do. Asher. Clara. I do. Pfft. Whatever it is, I'm up for it. Hey, I, uh... I want to explain where I've been the past couple of days, and why I wasn't answering my phone. No, that's okay. No, no, no, I want to. Um... So, my wife, Liz, she... Your wife? Well, see... Your wife? Oh, my God. Oh, no, no, no. It's not like that. No, she's not around or anything. Oh, my God, I'm such an idiot. What do you mean, she's not around? She's dead, Clara. She died. My God, Asher, I'm so sorry. It's... you... It was, uh, two years ago yesterday. And I forgot. You forgot? The, uh, the date. Caught me by surprise. I just... I've been... Look, I wanted to apologize because I was supposed to be at work, and I know I wasn't, and I'm sorry. Yeah, damn, yeah, yeah. No. Okay. You're a 28-year-old widower? Yeah. Yeah, I was, uh, 19 when we got married. Why? I was in love. Yeah, well... I was in love when I was 19, and I didn't get married. Well, I did. Oh, my God, I'm such a horrible person. What? Why? Daniel is at my parents' house right now. Yeah, of course he is. What do you mean, "Of course he is"? Well, you obviously needed some form of extreme backup when you changed your mind about inviting me. Come on! Are we both completely screwed up, Ash? Both of...? No, you are. That's for certain. Me, I'm a respectable widower, thank you very much. Right, you do have that going for you. Yeah. Bring on the ex, hmm? Are you allowed to scold your patients as if they were your third grade class? No. But they pushed me over the edge. Whatever, you're their doctor. They have to trust you. Asher agrees with me. I know, I do. Okay, but they do trust her! That's why it's great that you said it. I'm sorry, but yeah... People don't know what they want, so they just walk around coupling up like it'll save them. And, I'm sorry, but it won't. So it's great that someone they trust can tell them how it is. I may have gone too far, but they deserve it! You guys should see them. They hate each other. And I've known them for a while and they used to be happy. Then they chose the moment when their marriage went to shit to have a baby. It's just... It's mean. Exactly! It's mean to have a go at someone you don't know about things you don't understand. Well, yeah, but no. Ahem. I mean, it takes two seconds to see if a couple is happy, you know, if they belong together, or if they just settled, right? Right, Clara? I mean, look in this room. No? Look at Francisco and Eva. It's obvious they belong together. Obvious who's happy and who's not. Here you go. Yeah, the mole's, um, it's great. Ahem. Where did you, uh... How'd you learn how to make it? Oh, this old lady in Oaxaca taught me. We were setting up sort of like a pirate health station. Thanks. He's not neutralizing him, is he? Maybe you can have a threesome later. The trick is just to let the last chili float. It will be great with the chocolate, so then you get the hotness without the acidity. You get the punch. Actually, if you grind it all up before, and then let it meld together, it makes it smoother. But it's probably a bit too late for that now, I guess. Oh, is that right? Oh, sorry, one of my patients is the son of a Mexican chef. Oh, 'cause I thought your Mexican grandmother Jacinta taught you how to make mole. She's not real, Daniel. Clara made her up. We can't all be as authentically Mexican as you, champ. Or as randomly bicultural as you, right, champ? Okay. Enough, please! That's enough! Thanks for dinner, Daniel. It's too late for mole. Let's go to bed, please. Clara... Good night. Good night. Good night. I'm sorry he's being a dick. Don't. Don't, please. What, I'm sorry. Uh, I got to say, Clara... It's starting to feel like he has a valid reason for it. Ash, I... Don't... I'm not asking for details. I just, um... I've got to say it. Good morning, Asher. Morning. Do you want to play? Uh, sure. Yeah. Deal him in, Francisco. Thanks. Hey, listen, bro, I'm really sorry about last night. It got kind of weird. I'm sorry. It's fine. What's going on? You're in time to get in. Come on. This family finds that most fights can be fixed with a game of poker. I should probably let you all know I'm not very good. Join the club. It's people lying. You know, that's what poker's all about. So that's why some of the members of this family excel at it, hmm? Are you good at telling when someone's lying to you, Ash, keeping stuff from you? Good enough to know you're not talking about poker anymore, sure. Eh, smart man. You still know how to pick 'em, Clara. Daniel, will you come with me for a second, please? I'll go anywhere you ask for as long as you ask. Okay, I'll take two. Are you having fun? You? Are you enjoying yourself? You? Did you enjoy yourself last night? How old are you? You're behaving like a child! Asher? Stop it! We're doing this? We're gonna do this? We're doing this. Here we go. I don't wanna wake up - alone feeling like a jackass ever again. You can't even stay and sleep next to me. All you've ever done is leave. Just leave already! I'm here. I haven't gone anywhere! I'm here. I'm not going anywhere without you. I don't believe you. You don't...? Why don't you believe that - people can fall in love and stay together? You've seen one every day of your damn life. I do believe people can do it. Other people, lucky people. I clearly pissed off the stars at some point, hence you. I've seen it succeed once, fail every other time. Many women come into my office falling down in tears 'cause they hate the husband I saw them fawn over a couple of years before. I see husbands leave their menopausal wives and come back next month with their teen girlfriends. Right, 'cause we are all like that, right? I'm like that? No you're worse, you didn't even show up in the first place. I love you. You love me? Just as you did the first - time which we learned wasn't that much. God, Clara... What are you doing with that child in there? I like him. Sure you like him! You like him like you like warm water. Please don't tell me you're with him 'cause he's easy, because I swear... I'll tell you whatever I want, okay? Every time I want to because this is all your fault! This is all your fault! You come back here, all entitled saying I'm a liar. Ten years ago it was me standing right here feeding you this intense love line and you just left! You left and you took all of that with you. I'll be damned if I let you do that to me again! That's what I'm doing with him, okay? I'm trying to make up for you. When he leaves, life will go on, no problem, but when you leave again... It was wonderful meeting everybody. Thank you for dinner last night. It was beautiful. Thank you. Asher... Oh, oh, she's coming back. She's coming back. Yep. Asher! Ash, wait! I'm sorry. Oh, it's fine. It's fine. Hey, can you bring my stuff to the hospital, please? I don't really feel like going back inside. No, no, no. Don't leave like this. What? I'm sorry. How? How do you want me to leave? I'm sorry. What am I doing here? What are you sorry for, what? I slept with him. I'm sorry that I slept with him. You think that's why I'm leaving? I know you slept with him. I knew that the moment I saw you two together. Come on, I'm not that stupid, Clara. What? Then... what? You still think you're using me. No, Asher, I'm not... I... I know you're not, but you don't. And as you stand here and say it to me, you still think you're lying to me. You think you're using me, but actually you want me... in the same way that you think you sleep around to keep your distance, but in fact you're looking for closeness, in the exact same way, Clara, that you insult your patients. You think you do that because you can't stand them. It's in fact because you adore them. You don't know yourself at all. No clue why you do anything. It'd be adorable if it wasn't so pathetic. And you left my car in Los Angeles. Have you been feeling alright? Very well. Lilly, I wanted to apologize for what happened during our last consult. It was completely unprofessional of me and I'm so sorry. I wanted to wait until Beto got here... Beto's not coming. Did he have to work? No. You were right. Mm. Lilly... Speaking of which... since this is our last scheduled consult, I wanted to tell you that I changed my birth plan. I respect you tons, but I'll no longer need you there. I've spoken to doctor Malmet and I believe his energy will suit me better on the day. Of course. It's your plan. You should do what makes you comfortable... ...and doctor Malmet is excellent. Can we begin? Sure. Clara, it's me and Bobby. Hello. Hi Tía Clara, you look terrible. Honey, do something for me. Go to your aunt's wardrobe and bring me some clothes to wear. Okay. Thanks. Please don't start. I'm sad, it's not like I killed someone. This is ridiculous. Get up and do something! This is chick flick behavior. Okay, things went wrong with a couple of boyfriends. But you're an adult, so you get up and get over it. That's it! What? It's just cute that you're saying that. You have no idea what you're talking about. Yeah, okay... I'm jealous, sis. You don't know what it's like to not be able to breathe because someone left. You didn't ten years ago when you married Max. And you don't know that you stay - with him 'cause you don't have enough imagination. Mom? I'm sorry, Bobs, I was playing. I didn't mean... I didn't mean that. No. Abby, please... No, no! Screw you. Screw you! You don't even know which guy you can't breathe over. This is Asher Grace. Message, please. ♪ I would've given you all of my heart ♪ ♪ But there's someone who has torn it apart ♪ Oh, hey, it's you! Hey, ooh, you brought a chica! Oh, my God, congratulations. He is so sweet! Too bad he's lost in bed. I... I blame his college girlfriends for that. Ooh. ♪ The first cut is the deepest ♪ ♪ Baby, I know ♪ ♪ The first cut is the... ♪ Dani! Hi! I'm singing about you! "The First Cut Is the Deepest." Dija, "El Primera Vida Es la Más..." 'Sup? Oh, you're bringing me...? I'll have one more. No, no, no. It's time to go, Clarita. Well... There you go. Ooh. There you go. Okay. Hmm. It's so unfair. What is? I use to dream about this. About this? Yeah... I'd be at some bar, with some guy, and dreamed that you'd walk in, carry me home. What's unfair about that? In my dream it wasn't sad. Come on. What? What is it? Can you breathe when you're not with me? What? I... ...yes. Do you think we've ever been in love? Oh, my... All right. Okay, your sister is an imbecile. No, it's not about her. I know. It... It's about this. This wasn't here two months ago. Because I'm getting old. This is an old-lady hand freckle. You're not helping. I'm saying that it's new. I know every inch of you, but you remain surprising. I notice every tiny change because I'm here to notice. My purpose in life... is to keep track of you, Abigail Barron. And I don't... care what your family theory is, and I am sure that it is complex, but that's love. I can breathe without you just fine. What would be the point? Thanks for drawing me a bath, like an English butler. No thanks needed... I peek when I undressed you so... it was a win-win. So can I ask you a serious question? Mm-hmm. Are you leaving again? I don't know. Why did you come back? Don't say it's for us, 'cause you were back months before you told anyone. I'm not with Doctors Without Borders anymore. Why not? Because... They asked me, very nicely to step down. Apparently... I lack commitment. They know you. Yeah. So you came back because you ran out of places to be far away in? That's awful. My whole life, I've wanted to be someone else... Your neck is the only place that's called me back. And my mom's kitchen. In second place. But... truth is, Clara... most of the time the one place I want to go to is hell. The food there is terrible. I don't wanna go there with you. I'll have to go alone. Just don't say I didn't ask this time. Are you in love with him? I've always been in love with him. Well... He's part of the family. You love him like family. It doesn't mean you're necessarily in love with him. Ever since he left... I've measured every man against him. Not him but, what he made me... feel No one measured up and it felt good to dismiss them. It made me feel superior, safe from making a mistake from settling, from becoming... Your sister. Yes. That's horrible, isn't it? Meanwhile you and dad... go and get married all in love... like we need to feel even less worthy. Nonsense. I'm serious. It's an unclearable bar. Sweetheart, don't be a moron. The amount of times I've fallen out of love with your father, I can't even count them. Besides, you think I always knew it would turn out this well? When I met your father he was spray painting underpasses, barefoot in Echo Park. I moved in with him because... he was the most gorgeous man, that's for sure. But you think I knew... I'd love him and marry him forty years later? It wasn't promising. You see? It's all bullshit. It's not all bullshit. Everybody loves somebody eventually... but it's a gamble. You choose someone and you go all in. No guarantee. If you ask me, you're ahead of the game, you already know who you want your money on. Mom... Love shouldn't be simple, honey... but it should be easy. Are you a witch, mother? Hello? Hi, Dr. Barron? Dr... Barron? Asher. I'm calling about Lilly Alvarez. What's going on? Look, Clara, she's, uh... She's gone into labor, and she's all by herself. Now, I know you're not her doctor anymore, but she's terrified, and since you broke up her marriage, I thought maybe... I'll be right there. If everybody loves somebody, I love you. Mm! Who would have said of my two kids you'd turnout to be the cheesy one? Hi, Beto! Beto, Beto. No, this won't do... get dressed. Your wife's in labor. Yes, I know, but she doesn't want me there. Oh, my God, Beto, okay. I don't wanna tell you what to do. Last time you listened to me and that was bad. But here it goes... Your problem with Lilly? You care too much about what she thinks. She's your wife, she's in labor and you'll be there whether she likes it nor not. Okay? She will like it... you'll see. Okay, yeah... I'm coming. Beto! Beto! Beto! See? I told you. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, I should have come before. Hi. I'm Dr. Barron. I'm here to check up on Clark Alvarez's cleaning. Sure. I was about to bring him to his parents. Oh, that's okay. I'll do it. Okay. You're welcome. Thanks. He's named after Superman. Hey. Hi. Hey. It's good that you came. Can't believe you brought Beto. Yeah. Turns out I miss the Alvarezes. Who would've thought? Me. Never know what you have, right? I should go. Ahem. Okay, uh, good to see you, Dr. Grace. Goodbye, Dr. Barron. Look, Clark, those are your parents. We'll have a long chat about them later, okay? I know. What's up, son? What's up, baby? ¿Qué Paso, muchacho? You're gonna make him cry, give him to me. No, he's fine. He's with his dad. You're not holding him right. Just taste it. Okay, okay. Is it good? Uh-huh. Ahem. Yeah. What you doing that for? Bobby, don't answer that alone! It's Aunt Clara. I told her to wait. Abs... Don't say you're sorry. You were wrong. I know. I'm not saying you were wrong to be mean to me... I'm saying the content was wrong. You are fundamentally mistaken about my marriage. I know. I do. I really do. Okay. So what are you standing there for? I don't... There's pasta. Fine. We forgive you. So, pasta, huh? Yeah. I made the sauce. You literally just got here. Don't. Mm! You look great! Hmm! Happy. A million epiphanies will do that to you. That's why I avoid them. My patients had their baby... My patients with the massive issues The ones you scolded? Yeah, them. I was watching them hold their baby and all I could think was: I want that. You want massive issues? I can help you with that. I see it all the time, new babies, happy couples, families. But now I want it. No, you and I are family. We're not a couple. We grew up. That's that. I know, I know. I'm sorry I left. I'm sorry I let you go. The number-one thing I always tell girls your age Is always, always use a condom. The fact that you have already had a kid and in a month you already look like that is amazing! Face just hit the surfboard, and I started, just, like... I see it everyday, love. Come on! And everyone gets it. Even if it doesn't look just right... Guys, I love you. Or if it's not fed everyday... Stay in touch. I'll come back soon, promise. Or it changes and becomes something new. Mmm! Love you. No one knows anything. I maintain love is a ridiculous, complicated, improbable thing. But... let it do its worst... it will surprise you. First date, Grace. Tablecloths. Hmm. Asher... I... I don't need a big speech, and you clearly don't know very much, anyway. That was the gist of my speech! You know, you don't know everything, either. Yeah, I know that, too. Mm! Oh! I still got you there! Have to catch me! Ahem. Australian Asher Grace is back. Pay up. Money. Give it to me. This was a bet? When did this become a bet? That's... That's the way we are. You bet against me! Just for the record, I'd like you to see who's collecting the money. Yeah, well, thank you, Max, but... Don't come to me with your dollar.
