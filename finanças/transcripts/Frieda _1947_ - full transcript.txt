Do you, Robert Dawson, accept this woman as your lawfully wedded wife? I do. And you, Frieda Mansfeldt, do you accept this man as your lawfully wedded husband? I do. The ring. Where's the ring? I now pronounce you man and wife. Feel better? But... thirsty. It won't be long now. Russia. And then England. Home. Home... your home. What is it? You look scared? England. England? Nothing to be frightened of in England. Certainly not in Denfield, where I come from. You're not frightened of me, are you? You'll be all right. It's a pleasant, peaceful spot. At least it used to be. Tucked away in the South. They're kindly, good-natured people, most of them. Easy-going. Nothing to be frightened of in Denfield. Nothing at all. It's quite an ordinary town. Like any other town in England. Most of the families have lived there for donkey's years. Ours has. An old house just off the Market Square. I was born in that house. I spent most of my life there. My brother Alan was married in that house the day before it was shot down. Five years ago. Only five years ago. Yes, that's right. Alan's wedding. Summer, five years ago. 1940, just after Dunkirk. My brother Alan, and Judy. Flight Lieutenant Alan Dawson, DFC. Judith Diana Elizabeth. Champagne, speeches, aunts, uncles and friends. Judy, Alan, and me. We'd always been together, the three of us, since we were kids. It had always been more or less understood that Judy should marry one of us. The only question was, which? To the best man. Who lost. Mother was delighted whichever it was. She loved Judy. She always wanted a daughter. Now she had one. All my love, Robert. - Robert. - Dear Robert. Mother, dear. Dear mother. A life begins and ends with a family in the four walls of home. Aunt Nell's different. Ambitious, progressive, passionately concerned with what's happening to the world as well as to the family. She'll end up in the War Cabinet. - They could do with a bit of shaking up, too. - I say. Here's to you, Bob. - Mother. - Cheer, Bob. Edith was there, of course, in charge of my stepbrother, Tony. Good old Edith. She's looked after us almost as long as I can remember. Edith and the hat she wore for all occasions. Weddings, christenings, funerals. A tough, solid, dependable hat. Like Edith herself. - Happy, Liz? - Terribly happy, darling. But the name is Judith. I, Judith, took thee, Alan. Liz to me. Don't worry, Judith. You'll be all right. Alan was born under a lucky star. Five years. Seems more like five hundred. But you've nothing to be frightened of. Nothing to worry about. They're just ordinary everyday people. Most of the others in Denfield are much the same. You'll like them all right. But... But can they like me? A German. Front page again, picture and all. And all set to get among the pigeons. Good morning! Hey, mum, how did they take it, Mrs. D and the rest? If I was you, young man, I'd try minding me own business by way of a change. Aw, go on, five us a tip. - The whole town is talking it's head off. - Well, I'm not. Is it the papers, Edith? I'll go. Oh, you've got them. Edith, is it in again? It is. - He's on the front page, mother. - Who dear? The werewolf. Tony, Frieda helped Robert to escape. We must all remember that. Now run and get your things, dear, There's a good boy. You'll be late for school. Lily the werewolf is my name, I bite, I eat... - What's that you're saying, Tony? - Oh, nothing. Aunt Nell... We're famous, aren't we? - Notorious would be nearer the mark. - What's the difference? One's more or less pleasant the other isn't. That's what I thought. How long is she going to live with us? Until Robert can afford a home of his own. Why can't he afford it now? I thought schoolmasters were awfully rich. Robert hasn't been a schoolmaster for six years. - Yes, but... - You'd better hurry up, or you'll be late. What's the matter? It's this girl of Robert's. They're writing it in the papers, upsetting Mrs. Dawson. Upsetting everyone. - None of their business. - I'm glad you approve of her anyway. Approve? I certainly do not. But I've a right to say what I think. I'm one of the family. They're not. Your bacon's under the grill. - What do you think, Edith? - Never you mind. Now the rockets have stopped the air raid, we might finish the war in peace. - Oh, beg your pardon. - Thank you, Edith. Bob's marriage is shaking Edith to her foundations. It's going to shake all of us one way or another. Heavens, I'm starving. Nell, have you settled what day you'll open your election campaign? I'm not sure that I'm going to stand. - But you've agreed. - I happen to be Robert's aunt. But, darling, Robert, Robert's wife, they have nothing to do with you standing for Parliament. They'll have everything to do with it, if I stand. Why? This marriage is like a red rag to a bull. John Bull. My opponent would be a fool if he didn't wave it for all he's worth. I'll go. - May I come in? - Hello, Mr. Hobson. - Hello. - Good morning, Miss Dawson. You've come about the repairs to the upstairs room? Well, I have and I haven't. Mother's awfully anxious for them to be done by the time Robert and his wife arrive. It's like this, I have only one man, and he... Well, he lost his son in the Ardennes. I know, Mr. Hobson. - Well, he... - You can be frank with us. The fact is, Ms. Dawson, he's against this marriage. He won't come within a mile of this place. Not if there's a German. He says... I'm sorry, mum, but that's how it is. Don't apologize. We quite understand. I'm sorry. Oh, no, How can people feel like that? Without any difficulty, I imagine, in the sixth year of the war. Mother, darling, Robert's coming home. Cling on to that. It's the only thing that counts. Robert's coming home. Is that you Nell? I'm making a salad for lunch. Did you check if we had any tomatoes? Where are you, Nell? Robert... - Hello, mother. - My dear. Let me look at you. You're thinner. And... Mother... this is Frieda, my wife. It's all right, mother, She won't bite. My dear. Well, let's go upstairs now, shall we? Come along. We weren't expecting you until tomorrow, you see, Robert? Nell's in the town somewhere... and Judy will be back to lunch. She's been helping Mr. Whitlock with the farm. He's shorthanded with both his boys away. And Tony's at school, of course. Robert! Hello, Edith. Oh, Robert. I thought you'd been called up. I've been bowler-hatted on account of me feet. Edith, this is my wife. Pleased to meet you, madam. Ah, that's right. Come along now. Robert had this room ever since he was a small boy. I'm having a wardrobe moved in for Frieda's things, Robert. And here's the old chest of drawers for yours. Why, what is it, my dear? - Won't this do for you, Robert? - For one of us, mother. For one of you? Robert, you are married? Yes and no. I think I have to sit down. We were married in Cracow, Poland. At a Protestant church. Frieda's a Catholic, so the marriage isn't valid for her. But I'll go round St. Margaret's in the morning and fix things up with Father Elliot. You're... you're not going to do it all again? Yes, Mother. Meanwhile, Frieda must have her own room. If that isn't possible here, we'll have to go to an hotel. No, no. We'll manage somehow. Robert can go in the dressing room. You may stay in here, my dear. I'm afraid the window's broken. One of those dreadful rockets... I must go and see for lunch. I'm sure you'll be hungry after your journey. Edith won't be long. Well, here we are. Yes. Journey's end. Yes. I spent half my life in this room. Soap. A whole tablet of soap. There's luxury for you. Thank you, Robert. What I've done for you anyone would have done. What you did for me, very few. - Any woman. - Oh, rubbish. Why are you looking serious? I am just happy, Robert. Good. I'm happy to be here. To be anywhere... with you. Who is that? My father. He was killed in the last war. And that? My brother Alan. Judy's husband. - He's like you. - Think so? Yes. Younger, a little. Fourteen months. Wonder what sort of a war has he been having. Better than me, I'll bet. Always was a lucky devil. Oh, there's Judy now. Come down and meet her. Liz! Alan. - Hello, Judy. - Bob. Why, you look as though you'd seen a ghost. How wonderful to see you. Funny. Never been greeted like this before. Welcome home. Thanks. Oh, Frieda. Come on down. Frieda, this is Judy. Alan's wife. - Hello. - Hello. By the way, where is Alan these days? Why, Judy, where's Alan stationed? Oh, it's all right. Frieda left her transmit at the customs. Alan was shot down, Bob. Three months ago. - What does she look like? - Oh, ordinary enough, you know. Yes, that's the devil of it. Thanks, Jim. The German's look so ordinary, most of them. You forget they're not like the rest of us. It'd be a whole lot easier if the Germans looked like the Japs. - You're right, Counselor. - I'll try for the brown. Bad luck. Five only to us. Aren't we talking a bit out of term? We haven't even met the girl yet, you know? Now is the time to talk, Joe. As soon as you meet her you won't think of her as a German. - You'll just think of her as a girl. - We don't have to meet her, Mr. Lawrence. We can't help ourselves, Burt. Denfield's not London. Besides, it's not just a question of meeting the girl. We all know the family. They'll be getting their backs worse far more than she will. Yes, true enough. How will it affect Eleanor Dawson at the election? Are you chaps still backing her? We're backing her all right. But I'm worried, Joe. Don't mind admitting it. Denfield's got good reason to be grateful to Eleanor Dawson. It won't turn sour on her because of this girl. And she's the right member for this constituency. She's the right member, no matter what. - I hope you're right, Frank. - I hope you're right. Oh, Edith. Tony's waiting to say good night. I'm coming now. Did you make up the bed in the dressing room? I did. Separate rules indeed! Just because she's isn't C of E. - I call that splitting hairs. - Now, Edith. Well, miss, I do. Either you are or you aren't. - Turning the place upside down. - No, she has nice, quiet ways. So has a mine till it explodes. You'll need a ration book and you've got to register. We'd better go to the Town Hall in the morning. - Off to bed already? - I'm a little tired. Of course. Sleep well. Good night, Miss Dawson. Oh, good night, Frieda. Come along. Mother's getting you a hot water bottle. It's a bit cold at night. It usually is this time of the year in England. Hello, Nell. - Why did you do it, Robert? - Do what? Marry Frieda when you're not in love with her. How did you know? I know you, my dear. When you were in love, you showed it. Judy? That was clear, straightforward. But this is... Far from clear to me. Don't you see what I owe her, Nell? She gave me my freedom. It would have cost her her life. So I had to bring her with me. To get a British passport, I had to marry her. I see. - I'm going to hate her! - You mustn't talk like that, Tony. - It's wicked to hate. - It isn't wicked to hate Germans, Edith. - It says so in the papers. - Never mind what you see in the papers. Let it go in one eye and out the other. But she's German, isn't she? - Edith, why is it wicked to hate her? - Because... Well, because I say so! Now lie down and go to sleep. There's a good boy. Oh, all right. But I think that's a rotten answer. I'm not a child, you know? I think she's beastly. I think she's sweet, Robert. Thanks for being so nice to her. I'm not, particularly. Yes you are, particularly. I'd have understood, after Alan... if you'd hated her. I don't think Alan would have wanted me to hate her. - Do you? - No. Could you talk about Alan? What happened? Alan was shot down over the Rhine. Just before Christmas. Christmas Eve. It wasn't really a shock to me. I've been living close to it every day... every hour, for five years. We all used to say that Alan was born under a lucky star. But I think that we both knew that... it couldn't last forever. I... I've never talked about it before. Don't, if it hurts. No... somehow it helps telling you. Would you like to have your breakfast in bed in the morning? No... No, with Robert, with you. Oh, of course, if you'd rather. Please. Your father and mother? Yes. It must be strange for you away from them. Away from home. Yes. We must see if you can write to them. To tell them of your safe arrival. My father kept a book shop, in K?ln. They were killed in an air raid. Both of them. I'm sorry. It was over Cologne... that my son Alan was shot down. Well, I... I'll leave you now if you have everything you want. Thank you. - Well, good night. - Good night. - Mrs. Dawson. - Yes? I'll try to make for Robert, for you, a good wife. I'm sure you will, Frieda. Good night. I don't want to be tiresome, but it is a little difficult trying to impart the Holy Scriptures to the younger generation with your class next door making more noise than Joshua at the Walls of Jericho. Sorry, Bob, I was five minutes late. and they were ragging the light out of young Tony Dawson. I told the old man he should keep Dawson at home until things quietened down a bit. But he's as obstinate as a mule. - Says it smacks too much of defeat. - The headmaster's quite right. That fellow must have guts. Marrying a fraulein and bringing her back to the family seat as it were. I don't blame him wanting her. They're pretty, some of those Lili Marlenes. I mean, why go and marry the girl? Now, if it had been me... - Yes, Beckwith, I'm sure you would. - I would! But Robert Dawson happens to be one of those fellows who... Hello, Pop. - God bless my soul! Well, well, this is the most astonishing thing. Delighted to see you, my boy. Delighted, I'm sure! You don't know Beckwith O'Latham, do you? - No. - O'Latham's you successor, you know. Beckwith, mathematics and games. Indoor and outdoor. No extra charge, you know. Gentlemen, Robert Dawson. Well, well, well! So you're the... - O'Latham. - How do you do? How do you do... will you excuse me? I have a class waiting. Saved by the bell. Latham lost a leg in Dunkirk, poor fellow. He's apt to be a little... - Is the old man in, Pop? - Yes, I think so. Go ahead. - When were you out, Robert? - Last week. Just kept out of sight. - Splendid! See you later. - Yes, rather. Come along, Beckwith. You'll be seeing plenty of Dawson when he comes back to us. Oh Lord, Pop, you don't think he's going to ask the old man to take him on again, do you? My dear Beckwith, you're the Mathematics master, but I believe two and two do make four. They probably do. Do I understand you don't want your old job back? In the circumstances, no, sir. Your life outside the school, Robert, I mean your home life, is not my concern. Nor anyone else's here, as long as I'm headmaster. Do I make myself clear? - Yes, sir. - Good. I appreciate your kindness, sir, but... Kindness, fiddlesticks! Good masters are few and far between. We need you here. Now, when can you start? It's five years since I took a class. I don't know whether I can pick up the reigns. - I'm not very sure of myself. - Then you need us as much as we need you. A week or two in the old job and the years will roll back. Work does more for us than doctors, you know, and costs less. Shall we say Monday, your old form? All you have to do is to fill in these forms in triplicate, giving date of birth, name, address, temporary and/or permanent. Send a copy each to the Ministry of Fuel and Power, the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Agriculture. - Why? - Why, because it's the procedure. - Next, please. - I want to register with another butcher. Third window along. Next! I want a ration of clothes coupons and an identity card for my sister-in-law. She's a foreigner who's become a British subject. Here are her papers. - Is this the er... - Yes. Just a moment. Oh, Mrs. Freeman! - Mrs. Freeman. - Oh, hello, Judy. I'd like you to meet Bob's wife. Frieda, this is Mrs. Freeman. She's a very old friend of the family. - How do you do? - How do you do? Well, I really must rush. I'm meeting Andrew Levens at 10:00. Now, madam. If you'll kindly give me your attention. I think my colleague here might be able to help you. You may speak English. Mrs. Dawson understands perfectly. Just give us the form to fill in and then we'll get on. Thank you. Come along, Frieda. Well, that's cool, I must say! Giving out rations to a German girl. We'll be feeding the whole nation before long, Madam. What can I do for you? Where's Elliot Matthews, do you know? No, sir. You sure? Yes, sir. And Martin, Rogers, Stephenson, Caulder... - Where's Caulder, Bailey? - Don't know, sir. Sick, I suppose, sir. - Seems to be quite an epidemic. - Yes, sir. Well, Williams, perhaps you can solve the mystery for us. Yes, sir. If you really want to know. Yes, I do. They're not coming anymore, sir. Their parents don't want them to. Something about undesirable associations, Caulder told me his father said. And I wouldn't be surprised if there weren't one or two more of us away after today, sir. Thank you, Williams. Hey, Stinker... Hey, pass it on. Dawson. Come here, Dawson. Dawson, I said come here. Give it to me, please. I said give it to me. No, Chapman, we don't. We just say good morning and try to behave like ordinary human beings. In fact, like you, Chapman. And by the way. The word is 'Heil'. H-E-I-L. Not H-I-L-E. Is there anything else anyone would like to know? All right, Dawson, you may go back to your desk. All right, boys, you can go. - I'm sorry, Tony. - It's all right, They think they're funny. Do you want any help? - No, thanks, I can manage. - Sure? Yes. If there's anything I can do, let me know. No, thanks. I can manage. Come in. Oh, come in, Robert. Look... my wife picked up this lovely piece in Seven Oaks yesterday. - Isn't it perfect? - Yes, it's beautiful. Well, how are things going? Cigarette? - Thanks, - Settling down all right? - I am, sir. - Good. But I appear to be unsettling the rest of the school in the process. Really? I hadn't noticed it. The match is by your hand. I think you had, sir, but you're turning a blind eye. It's very nice of you, sir, but it won't work. - I don't follow. - Three of my class were absent yesterday. Five today. You must have heard of it, sir. I made the report out myself. Oh, yes, yes... Stephenson and Cole. Well, frankly, I don't attach much importance to that. - There's a good deal of flu about. - My wife's German. The boys go or I go. That's it, isn't it, sir? Look here, Robert. You know your job. I told you before that's all that concerns me. If you want to keep it, let them withdraw every boy in the place. It's yours. Goodbye, sir. And thanks. Oh, very well. Things will be different, Robert, after the war. - Tony! - Shhh! Is Mother in? - I will call her. - No! You'll ruin everything. If she sees me like this, it will be a most awful stink. Your knee! There is dirt in the wound. Come. - It's not a wound, it's a cut. - It must be washed. Oh, all right. Women do fuss. - Sit down, please. - I'm all right. It's nothing, I tell you. I only wish women would leave me alone. - Oh, come... - Thank you, I'll do it myself. - I may not touch you? - There's no need. I'm a nurse. - In Germany. - In any country. What happened? Nothing. Just a fight. - Who do you fight? - A friend of mine. - You had an argument? - He said something. I had to take steps. What did he say, your friend? He said you were a... You... You fight about me. Yes. But... But you hate me. Tony, you hate me. Why do you fight your friend for me? I don't! I don't hate you, Frieda. It's awful! I know I ought to. But I can't. I tried. I tried like anything. But I am no good at it. Please, do not apologize. If Nell fights this election, make no mistake, she'll have to fight it on one issue, and one issue only. The German girl. And whoever makes out she can run way from that issue is talking tripe, and you know as well as I do. Thank you, Mr. Lawrence. Now we know exactly where we are. We don't, my dear, but we've got to. That's why we're here. If the opposition are looking for luck to sing they've got it here on a plate. We know Ns, Dawson's views about Germany. Will she stand by them absolutely, in spite of this marriage? Yes, I will. In public, if they challenge you? You'll have to, my dear, if you're going to stand. Don't think it won't be hard. They're your own family, I know how it will hurt, but... if you can't give us your word, we shall have to find somebody else. Will you give me until tonight to decide? Of course. But you must have a job of some sort, Robert. - What will you do? - Oh, I don't know, mother? Get something bigger, perhaps. Oxford, a fellowship, who knows? Or I can help Judy on Whitlock's farm. You don't look so good in civvies, Robert. I don't feel so good, either. You looked fine in uniform, didn't he, Frieda? He looks fine out of uniform, too. Much better. Oh, do you think so, Judy? - You liked Alan in uniform. - But I'm not Alan, Mother. Of course not, dear. But sometimes, you know, you look so like him. - Someone's running a bath. - Yes, come along, dear. I was afraid of this. Good night, Robert. Good night, Judy. Good night, Frieda. Good night, Tony. There you are, this one goes here, doesn't it? This one here. You're not very good at this, are you? You should have been a prisoner of war. I know this one by heart. Robert... Hm? About the wedding... Oh, that's all right. I've seen Father Harris. Two-thirty, Wednesday. Robert... I would like to wait. Wait? Why, what for? You know how it is, with me here. - Yes, I'm sorry. - Oh, I do not mind for myself. Only for you. I'm a stone about your neck. I'm bad for you here. So it is best if we wait for our wedding. - Wait. - Wait and see? Yes. Wait and see. I ought to have known how it would be for you. I should never have brought you here. Please. Please, do not regret. - Don't you? - No. Only for you. For me, everything is twice as terrible as before. And twice as beautiful. Everyone going around with faces as long as my arm. Robert losing his job, and the whole town acting as if we had the plague or something. She should have stayed in Germany where she belongs. - Edith. - Yes, Nell. It's Robert, isn't it? In a way. The strangest way. From the moment he came back ten days ago... I've been seeing Alan, not Robert. It's Alan, not Robert, who walks out there in the garden. Alan, not Robert, who sits down here at meals. I see Alan in everything Robert does. Robert is Alan to me. Darling, listen. One half of you knows that Alan is dead, and accepts it. The other half doesn't, and won't. To that other half, Robert is Alan. They were brothers, they looked alike. They wore the same uniform. It won't last, Judy. It will fade. And then? Then you'll see only Robert himself. - Mother. - Yes, dear? Hand me those pillow slips, will you? I'm going away for a while. - Going away? - Yes, you don't mind, do you? I need a change. It's Frieda, isn't it? Frieda? No. Of course, she's not what I wanted for Robert. But, by any means, I... You know, Judy. I had hoped that... perhaps in time... - You and Ro... - Mother! Please! I'm sorry, Robert. That's all right, Nell. I know how you feel about Frieda. - I knew the night she arrived. - Oh, my dear. And I hoped you'd needn't ever know. Yes, I knew. And if you stand for Denfield at the election, everyone else will know. - Isn't that it? - I must decide tonight. They want you, don't they? I mean, they think you're right for the job. But that doesn't matter. They're probably wrong anyway. Tell me to stand down, Robert. They'll find someone else. Yes, they'll find someone else, but... They won't find anyone like you. Go ahead, Nell. I'm telling you! Go ahead! All I ask you is this! Is Eleanor Dawson a fit person to represent you? I will not be sidetracked into a campaign of personal abuse! She's taken into her house a German! What matters most to us in danger is our houses. - Who for? - Germans? She has welcomed into her family an enemy! - A Nazi! - A fraulein! We demand an answer! You have chosen to judge my attitude to the German nation as a whole by my attitude to this one German girl. I had hoped you would have allowed this problem to remain a personal one, for me and my family to face in our own way, But I have been accused of running away from a greater issue. Very well. I'll answer that accusation. The responsibility for plunging the world into the misery and disaster of the last five years is not the responsibility of one man or one group of men, but of every individual member of the entire German nation, man and woman. Okay, lady, how about the girl in your own house? Is she responsible? I'll answer that. Yes, she is. Passively, or actively... she has been party to a monstrous crime. She cannot evade responsibility for it. She has no right to escape its consequences. Then it does not matter what I am myself. If I do right or wrong. If my heart is good or bad. I am a German, that is all that counts. I'm sorry, Frieda. You see, we're at war. When peace comes, public opinion will soften up. You'll see, Frieda. You'll be the yardstick, the barometer. With every month that passes, things will become easier for you. Six months from now you'll be accepted here. By you. By nine people out of ten. By you. I'm the tenth. But don't let that bother you. What I and a few people like me think won't matter. It will matter to me. Oh, I see. To be satisfactory, the conquest must be complete. How very German. You will never accept me. Never. War isn't a football match, Frieda. When it's over, you don't shake hands and... wish your enemy luck in the years to come. There have been wars like that. But not this one. I hope not this one. - Nell, we're going to be late. - Just coming. What's this morning's program? Pensions Committee at 10:30, housing debate at 11:00. - Here are the figures you asked for. - Oh, thanks. I shan't be sorry when the House rises. That's Mary's writing, isn't it? - Give her my love when you write. - Of course. Better hurry. See you tonight. You're dining with Masters, from the Food Ministry. Right. Goodbye. Dearest Judy, I can't think how many letters I must owe you. And now I am writing, I have very little news. Everything goes on much the same, except we miss you both. Edith has been laid up. That's one of the reasons I haven't written before. Although it's no excuse, really, because Frieda's been wonderfully helpful. She actually seems to enjoy housework, which is a blessing, as one doesn't want to impose on her. She's an excellent cook. Better than Edith. Only that's a secret. Since Edith's been about again, Frieda and Robert are helping on the farm. I think it's helped them. Robert is really very good with her. Of course, they haven't a lot in common. And, under the circumstances, one can't expect too much. But they do seem to be settling down quite nicely... and making the best of things. Frieda! This is the Gaumont British news... presenting the full facts of a crime unparalleled in the history of the world. Horror in our time. Inside the gates of the Belsen concentration camp... is a city of the living dead. Human beings reduced to worse degradation than the world has known even in the darkest age. Almost undistinguishable from the corpses all around the living drag out their terrible existence side by side with the dead. This most pitiful sufferer almost breaks his heart in an effort to smile at the rescue that has come nearly too late. This indeed is Hitler's new order. Far worse than death itself has been the fate of these victims of the master race. They move about the compounds of Belsen, unconscious of each other, unconscious of freedom, living only in a perpetual nightmare of torture, disease, and insanity. Humanity cries out... that the atrocious deeds committed in the name of Germany must never again desecrate the earth. My people did that. No, Frieda. My people. Germans. But did you know? Yes, you must have known. I knew. I knew there were such places. We all knew. Some of us were inside them. I don't suppose they'll be long, Edith. Don't wait up. - Very well, madam. Good night. - Good night, Edith. Frieda, about the wedding. You said wait. We have waited. Too long. Will you marry me? At once. Tomorrow? Well? Oh, no! No. Not now, my dear. Not now. Robert. Thank you for asking me. Listen, Frieda. We must put this evening out of our minds. Blot it out forever, both of us. I know it won't be easy. It'll take time. But we must do it. Otherwise it'll come between us and destroy every chance we had of happiness. Promise me you'll do that. Frieda, promise. I'll try. Oh, Robert, I'll try. Any luck? Christmas shopping is too delightfully simple these days. You just pay too much for something you don't want and think yourself lucky. Any messages? They want a speaker at the Caxton Hall meeting on the 27th. I ought to be down at Denfield. My constituents will think I'm neglecting them. Mother wants us to spend Christmas with the family. She says we're neglecting them. The invitation comes from Bob and Frieda, too. You come too, Judy. Should I? Why not? It's all right now, isn't it? Robert and Alan, I mean. I don't know. You were right, Nell. I accept now fully that Alan is dead. He'll be part of me. Always. But Bob... It's all right up here away from the family, but... if I go back... I don't know. I don't know, Nell. # It's called the okey cokey # # It's corny, but it's okey # # Okey cokey, okey dokey # # Next time right arm out # # You put your right arm out, right arm in # # Right arm out and shake it all about # # You do the okey dokey and you turn around # # that's what it's all about # # Next time left foot out # # Put your left foot out, left foot in # # Left foot out and shake it all about # Oh, this is just as it should be. Nell, it's wonderful to have you here. - Lovely to be back. Quite like old times. - Things will never be quite the same again. Nothing ever is the same again. - Nell, we've missed you. - And I've missed you. All of you. How is everybody? If you mean Robert, he's fine. And Frieda? Frieda? Oh, Frieda's one of us now. # Put your left leg out, left leg in # # Your left leg out and shake it all about # # You do the okey dokey an' you turn around # # that's what it's all about # # Put your right hip out, right hip in # # Your right hip out and shake it all about # Crowded, isn't it? Hm? Well, here we are then. Why, you're trembling, Judy. I'll get your coat. No, I'm all right. Don't go. - Sure? - Yes, really. Got a light? - Have one? - Thanks. It's good to see you again, Judy. And you, Bob. You look really well. Are you? Yes. - And Frieda? - She's fine. We've had our bad times, of course. It hasn't been easy. But now I think everything's going to be all right. For both of us. I'm glad. Very glad. Robert! You promised Mrs. Halliday this dance. She's looking for you. Oh, Lord. So I did. Shan't be a minute. - Happy? - Oh, yes. I'm so glad you have come, Judy. We all miss you so much. You should not have come. There was no need, you know. Because I work for Nell, it doesn't mean that her opinions are mine. You haven't been thinking that, have you? When I left here, it wasn't because of you. I know why you left here, Judy. How are you, my dear? Exhausted by London, but all the better for seeing this. Jim, this is wonderful. I heard you were back. I hope it's for good. You might believe Miss Dawson. Christmas present for Dad. The best there is. I'm delighted. Yes, I reckon he's had his share. Haven't you, lad? I wouldn't say that, Dad. There's a lot worse. I'm one of the lucky ones. - Jim, you promised me this dance. - Oh, Judy! Sorry. Tom, that scar. You never told me. What was it? He was a prisoner of war, wasn't he? Yes, but he was sent to a concentration camp first. A guard did it there. Before the Red Cross got him transferred. How awful. What are you doing out here all alone? - Thinking. - Nice thoughts? Christmas in England. Peace. And then the New Year. Oh, Robert, I want a New Year. Yes. I'll be glad to see out the old one this time. Great lad. But we're over the worst, aren't we? Come on, let's go. They're a charming couple, aren't they? So right. You know Robert's coming back to school with us next term? Oh, good. I'm delighted. Frieda, don't forget you're both coming to dine with me next Wednesday. Oh, I haven't forgotten. She said it would be like this. In six months, she said, they will accept you here. - Who, Nell? - Yes. Because she knew. Can you understand, Robert? Because she knew. - Somehow, it seems wrong. - Yes. Darling, it's awfully hot in here. Let's depart, shall we? Everything under control, Judy? Everything under control. Like a swim? A good deal of water has flowed under many bridges since... How long is it? Six months? Seven months, two weeks and four days. Do you remember the hours? And the minutes. Every one of them. Frieda. Yes? Are you doing anything in particular tomorrow week? Because... if not, I... I wonder if you'd consider marrying me. Whatever comes, thank you for this moment. No one can take it from us. Not even we ourselves. Whatever happens... we have this safe. Oh, Frieda... Are you sure, Robert? Is it... is it all right? I know what I'm doing. You are sure? Quite sure. - Oh, but what's Frieda to wear? - Oh, white, madam! Yes, that's right. To make up for the last time. Oh, I would like that. But only a week? Yes, dear. You are rather rushing things. She'll have a white dress if I have to make it meself. - My wedding dress is upstairs. - Oh, no... - Why not? - Yes, mother, why not? - Would you like it, Frieda? - Oh, yes, but... Of course you must have it, Frieda. Of course. # Shepherds quake, at the sight # # Glories stream from heaven above # # Heavenly, hosts sing Hallelujah # # Christ the Savior is born. # # Christ the Savior is born. # # Stille Nacht # # Heil'ge Nacht # # Alles schl?ft # # einsam wacht # # Nur das traute # # hoch heilige Paar # # Holder Knab' im lockigen Haar # # Schlafe in himmlischer Ruh! # # Schlafe in himmlischer Ruh! # Frieda. I love you. - Merry X'mas, miss. - Here you are. - Oh, thank you, miss, Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Sorry, sir. - That's all right. Good evening. Good evening. My name is Richard Mansfeldt. I believe my sister Frieda lives here. Oh... - Come in. - Thank you. I'm so happy, Robert. Frieda! Ricki! Ricki! Ricki! I can't believe it! Is it really you? You can believe it. It's me. This is Richard, my brother. I thought he was dead. - How do you do? - Hello, there. But Ricki, this uniform, what is it... One moment, Frieda, I'll explain to you. I'll explain to all of you... I worked for the Africa Corps for two years. Then, in April 1942, I was captured at Tobruk. POW. Then one day we were told that prisoners from the Poznan Province were permitted to volunteer for the Polish Army. So I volunteered. But surely, you come from Cologne. Oh, yes, we live there. And Frieda was born there. But I was born in Poznan. That was German before Versailles. Now it's Polish. That's what the Poles said to us, 'You were born in Poznan, so you may fight for us, if you wish.' So I went with the Polish Army to Italy. - Now you're on leave, eh? - Yes, for one week. Oh, Ricki, I thought you were dead. No, Frieda, I'm here, and very much alive. And, Ricki, do you remember old Papa Shulster? - Yes. - Who kept the heat on the 'Bettstellen" so angry he was with you for making love to his daughter with your shoes off. And you said, 'You should be proud to have such a fine young man make love to your daughter... with or without shoes. Such a fine young man. Oh, Ricki, I'm so happy. So wonderfully happy. I see I shall have to look out. You seem to occupy a pretty large corner of Frieda's heart. I hope so. Good night. Good night, darling. Good night, Ricki. Good night, Frieda, sleep well. - We're just along here. - Thank you. Oh, Judy, how lovely! You're going to look lovely in it. Is it all right? Well, let's see, shall we? Hm... the waste will need taking in. - I'll do it for you in the morning. - Thank you. Twelve o'clock. Merry Christmas, Judy. Merry Christmas, Frieda. You know, I think far more marriages would be successful if we had to go through it all again every year. - Once is enough for most people. - Too much for some. Well, I must say I'm glad we're having this rehearsal. The Catholic marriage service is quite different from ours, I understand. - Yes, part of the services is in Latin. - Then it will be Greek to me. Hm? It does sound rather Irish. But it's the same we have in England. I'll pick you up by the time the rehearsal is over. You despise them, Nell. Who? Everyone. Denfield for accepting Frieda as you said they would. No, I... I like them for it. It's our strength and our weakness. But you wish tomorrow wasn't happening. Don't you? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. That part of our service is in Latin. But the actual responses of the bride and the groom are very similar to the responses in the Protestant services. I see. And the rings and so on, is that the same? Yes, that goes on the same lines. After the section we've just gone through it's all quite straightforward. It's when your bride joins you that it becomes a little different. Oh, Ricki, having you here, it makes everything complete. Except for one thing. A wedding present. - Oh, Ricki! You shouldn't. - I have it here for you. What is it? Now, Mr. Mansfeldt, if you please. The bride stands there, of course, on the left of the groom. And you, Mr. Mansfeldt, on the left of the bride, but a little further away. First I ask you separately concerning your consent to marry. Then you're given away by your brother, Mr. Mansfeldt. The groom takes your right hand in his right hand... Then, Mr. Dawson, you plight your troth to the bride in the following words. I, Robert Dawson, take thee, Frieda Mansfeldt, to my wedded wife... for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, till death do us part. Where shall we drop you, Father? - Is the Town Hall on your way? - Direct through. It's been a heavenly day. I hope it will be like this for them tomorrow. You don't approve, Miss Dawson? - Why do you say that, Father? - You weren't at the rehearsal. - I've read one or two of your speeches. - Yes? You believe the good German doesn't exist. I believe that we can't afford to divide the sheep from the goats. You admit the sheep do exist? Personally, I don't. I believe they're all tied to the same brush. - Nell! - In any case, we can't afford... to make distinctions. Smoke? Light one for me, will you, darling? Here you are, Frieda. What's that? - It's a road block. - Hm? Part of our defense preparations when we thought you were going to invade. I'm afraid they wouldn't have stopped our tanks for long. No, but they were good for morale. In those days we hadn't much else. I'm afraid we weren't ready for you in 1914 or 1939. No. How about the potentially good German, the man or woman who in time can be reeducated? You're an optimist, Father. I believe that human nature has reached rock bottom and is now in the upward grade. - Take people individually and... - You can't take Germans individually. - Why not? - Because there's a link, a... a common denominator in every one of them. Something that twice in our time has set the world ablaze. Call it the... the essence of Germanism. The German mind, call it what you like. It's common to every German, man, woman and child. And we're blind idiots if we believe otherwise. It's inborn. It's in the blood. You've made a conquest, Frieda. A great conquest. You have succeeded where Germany failed. You have conquered the English people. Congratulations. Ricki. Why did you give me this? He is dead, Ricki. Hitler is dead. Christ also died. Ricki. Why did you give me this? To remind you, Frieda. You are a German. I was not Nazi! You know that, Ricki! You were not anti-Nazi, you also know that. There is no other distinction outside the concentration camp. Ask anyone. Ask the English. I was just a nurse in the hospital. One of the people. - You are one of the people, like me. - No! Not like you! I'm not like you! I'm one German. You are another. This is your Germany. It is not mine. You say that now in defeat. Did you ever say it in victory? What is this other Germany of yours? Why is it known to my sister, and not to me? Hm? It is known to you, if you want it to be. Heine, Goethe, Schiller, Beethoven, Brahms... Our true greatness, Ricki. Our gift to the world. That is my Germany. If it is not yours, then... we are brother and sister... Yes... but we are not one. We are one. All Germans are one. - I do not believe it. - You must believe it! - Never! - We must all believe it... if our country is to live to be great again. Divided we are nothing. United we are a great people. Eighty millions. The heart and soul of Europe. And we have our lives to live. They do not deny us life. No one denies it. If we live our lives in peace. You forget we have been defeated. Defeated in war. You... You want it to happen again. That is what you mean by life. War. Yes, Ricki... it is there in your face. In the back of your eyes. You want it again. You want it again. No! Yes, Frieda. I want it again. Again, and again, and again! Ricki... What else is there for me but war? What else do I know? I'm 28. For six years I've fought. I've been trained for war, only for war, ever since I was 16. War is my life! Music, books, they are peace. What do I know of peace? What use is peace to me? How can I help you? I must help you. What can I do? You must stay here. Yes, Ricki... that is the way. In England you will learn to know peace. You will find a new life. Robert will help you. I will ask him tonight. He will find work for you. If this is Germany, then forget Germany. - I embrace Germany! - This is not Germany. It was! It will be again! Look, Ricki. Robert's father, killed in the last war, Alan, his brother, killed in this. I want a child, Ricki. Children! But not to be killed in the next! - Hello, Mr. Stanley. - Hello, Mr. Dawson. - Two quarts of bitter. - Right-o. - All right. And a scotch. Will you join me? - Thanks. Hello, there! Make it three, will you? Hello, Ricki. Missed you after tea. What happened? - I went for a walk. A long walk. - Yeah? It's good to be alone sometimes. - All the best! - Hello, Robert. - Hello, Mr. Merrick. What's yours? - Bitter, please. - Jim? - Malt, please. Coming up! Don't think you know my brother-in-law, Richard Mansfeldt. - How do you do? - Mr. Tom Merrick and his son, Jim. - How do you do? - Can we arrange it, Robert, my wife's having a big ado next Thursday week. Maybe your family'd care to run in. You'll be more than welcome. Thanks, I'm sure Frieda and I would be delighted to come. I'll tell the other members of the family, too. Fine. I know him! I'd know him anywhere. What is it, lad? - Brandenburg. - Brandenburg? Concentration camp. Five years ago I got this there. He was one of the guards. - I've never seen you before. - You don't remember. I do. I was never at Brandenburg. - That's a lie. - Steady, son. When a man does this to your face... you don't forget his. Not in a thousand years. There must be some mistake. He's German. Yes. He's my wife's brother. There's no mistake. Jim! The man's drunk. Let's go. No, you don't. We're going to settle this now. That won't prove anything, Jim. It's a job for the police. Okay. Get a copper, somebody. Quick! Just a minute! Give me five minutes alone with him, will you? I want the truth as much as anyone. More perhaps. And I'll get it quicker than the police. You can still send for them if you want to when I'm through. Jim. Five minutes. Now, Ri... Don't be a bloody fool! It'll look as if... It is true. You have your faith, I have mine. Where can I go? You must help me. - Help you? - Yes! Your wife's brother. Does Frieda know about this? Does she? Of course she does. How else could it be? We are brother and sister. Frieda and I, we are one. No... no! All Germans are one. Did no one tell you before? We are joined by three things. - Loyalty, faith, blood. - Shut up. Well, you wanted the truth, didn't you? - I'm part of Frieda and Frieda's part of me. - Stop it! You can't distinguish Frieda from me. You can't divide us in your mind. That is the truth. The only truth about the Germans you need to know. What you see in me, you will find in her, if you look for it. In her and in her children. In your children. Stop! Robert will be here soon. He's just at the Police Station. Thank you, Edith. There's a kettle boiling in the kitchen. I'll make you a nice cup of tea. - Oh, Edith. - Oh, mum, dear. Don't look so lost. I am, Judy. Without Robert, I am. Listen, Frieda. You and Ricki, you are two people. Different, separate. Whatever he is can't make you... Bob. Where is she? Upstairs. Bob, listen, she's... Bob! Bob! You were right, Nell. I accept your gospel. Every word. I hate every word. But I believe it. I wish she were dead. How could he? He can't have changed suddenly, in a few hours. I'm not sure. I wish I were. You're glad. You're glad it's happened. I want Robert's happiness, Judy. I want that above everything. There can be no lasting in happiness for him... with this girl. But you don't know her. I don't need to. She's German. That's the point. It always has been. If Robert sees it at last, then... then yes, Judy. I'm glad. Oh, Nell. If he would go now, now when he sees clearly... Does he? Do any of us? How do we know for certain? Put yourself in her place, Nell. Can't you feel what she must be feeling? Very easily. But I'm trying not to let feeling blind me. I'm crushing it down. You talk as if you were some sort of guinea pig, instead of a human being. Why do you speak for her, Judy? You don't want her on your conscience? Do you? Frieda. Frieda. Frieda! No! Robert! Robert! Frieda! Frieda! Frieda! Frieda! Frieda! Frieda! I wish she were dead... I wish she were dead. I wish she were dead. We are one. All Germans are one. We are one. All Germans are one. You're a German. That's all that counts. You're a German. That's all that counts. You're a German. That's all that counts. I want it again. I want it again. And again, and again, and again! Till death do you part. Frieda! Till death do you part. Till death do you part. Frieda! Frieda! She's all right. The doctor says you can go up. What a terrible thing. I blame myself as much as Robert. You? Yes, Judy. Yes. Frieda's been with us all this time, and I've never really faced up to what it meant having her here. I just hoped for the best. If only I'd thought about it a little more I might have been able to help Robert... when he needed me. I know what you mean. We're all different. But when the Germans are bad lot, we say, 'That's Germany.' All of it. Like Robert did about Richard. And, well, it can't be, really. Can it? - She's safe now, darling. - Safe, yes. Thanks to you, Nell. Thank heaven you saw her and realized. I saw her. I realized. And I let her go. You... You let her go? It was the one sure way out for all of us. Nell! And yet, it seemed logical. Frieda herself... It seemed logical. Even to her. You were wrong. Terribly wrong. Nell! Yes, I was wrong. No matter who they are, no matter what they've done, you can't treat human beings as though they were less than human. Without becoming less than human yourself.
