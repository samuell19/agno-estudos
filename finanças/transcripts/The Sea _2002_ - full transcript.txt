Fucking hell! We're closed. We're closed, kid. That soup was fantastic. The best lobster soup I've ever tasted. Thank you, Morten. Cloudberry jam! Here's to Thordur and Kristin! You're not saying much, Dad. What do you want to talk about? The sea's in its place, so are the hills, until the next landslide. How about a high quota and immigrant workers? Stick to what you know about. Your ideas on women's rights date from the Stone Age. Why did you bring us all here? Do herrings have a soul? Has the last cod raised the white flag? I'll say my say when the time is right. The mountain's pregnant. It will soon go into labour. Excellent wine. The meat isn't too dry? You never know how long a goose needs. Some geese don't need much time. They're always ready. You work magic in the kitchen. The sauce is delicious. What's Mangi up to these days? He was landing fish at our quay. His wife's dead. Both his sons are at sea, and they're doing well. You should've screwed them instead! She did. In a hut by the beach. We watched through a crack. We didn't come here to be insulted! Calm down! No one believes this clown. Morten does. His ears are bright red. My ears? Give me my cognac, Kristin. You don't drink cognac with goose! What's best for a corpse, cognac or wine? Cognac, of course. So give me cognac. You don't leave what you love. -Or? Rot away here like Haraldur? You can't freeze love like a fish. I thought you'd change your mind Iike people do when they grow up. No, I never change my mind. That's dangerous. I love you, you bastard! Sorry... I wanted to see the cellar. You've seen the cellar, Morten! Now fuck off! According to my accountant, you, my children, have for some time now exhausted every rightful claim to the estate I have administered since your mother's death. I have kept a register of all the assets that you have received from me. And I've kept all the receipts. To ensure that the community's resources and livelihood remain in responsible hands, I took measures concerning the company that will be announced in due time. You will get nothing from me. Any claims in connection with the estate will be against you. An angel flew by... Mother, perhaps. The weather's turning bad, the sea's getting rougher. I don't give a fuck about the weather! I hate your country weather! And I hate the people even more! I was buried alive here for 20 years! When I went to bed, there were black clouds over my bed! We're not prisoners here. We can go abroad when we feel like it. We're hours from a London hotel room. Wonderful! Pick the place where you want to get bored. What about these mountains, Aslaug? Does it turn you on having a landslide thrust up between your legs? She starts to get nasty when she drinks. Starting? She's always that way. We wait till she calms, like a storm. Shut up about the fucking weather! Eat something, you prick! I'm not hungry. -Eat shit then. Or shitty dried seabird if you want. You're getting blasted again? Mind your own business! What are you looking for? -My ciggies. Smoking will kill you. Men haven't the brains to live or die. Is it a matter of brains? Your sister didn't need explanations. It's nice you have fond memories of her. She had the brains to die. Have I ever bothered you? No. I'm half-dead anyway. There again... Who knows? Maybe you have. Wouldn't surprise me if you killed her. She wasn't blind. She saw what was going on around her. May God forgive you for those words, because no one else will be able to. God never forgives. But He spares those who don't deserve it. Ragnheidur... Got any Coke? It won't work, Aslaug. Why not? The signature's forged. -Who says? I called Kristin. That fucking bitch! I'll keep the file safely. As a souvenir. Damn! Your Dad didn't believe anyone would ever want to fuck you! Sales order What the hell is going on? Have you gone crazy, you bitch? You're mad, you're going to kill me! Ragnheidur, please! For pity's sake! Put me down! Put the car down! Dad, as your children, we all agree Kristin and you deserve a change. We want to sell the company. That's out of the question. Agust will be taking it over soon. Agust!? That's unrealistic! He's a musician! He's having a child! You don't know what realistic is. It's not business to fillet fish at every godforsaken place around. We want to help Kristin, Dad. The house is too big for her. There's a flat for you in Reykjavik. You're not sending me to some hospice! You can drag my body around after I die, not before! Here's a written declaration. We'll see to the details later. It's the only way, Dad. Believe me. I want to talk to the old man. Find him yourself. I dream of making a film about a transparent woman. What are you? A legally certified ghost? You can fool yourself, but not me. I remember the way you looked at Mom when she was ill. Children notice such things. Calm down. We'd lie and listen to the bed creaking. I can still hear it now! The sound of your fucking orgasms still echoes in my head. You realize what that can do to an unformed child's mind!? Listening to your mother's death throes mixed with the grunting of your Dad and aunt!? Agust and Maria have disappeared into the dark together. And if they find a place somewhere to make love, whose fault is that? Isn't it time to face up to that before you destroy any more souls? Sign this, and we keep the company going in another form, as shareholders in a big trawler company. I won't let you destroy my life's work! Are you deaf, you stubborn old fuck? No one was talking about fish here! What about you, Agust? do you want to sell too? You want to destroy my life's work too? Will you betray me too? What do you know about me? What do you want me to know? I gave up studying ages ago. I presume you'd learnt enough. Why were our clothes home-made as kids? Why was he silent when fishing was bad? Why were we scared when he was at home? Why did you unplug the main fuse when you went to bed? I didn't teach you to complain. Fishing was everything. Never needed us. No, thank heaven, I've never needed you for anything! You cried crocodile tears when Mom died! Her substitute was close at hand. Almost the same but twice as malleable! Agust, that's enough! Everyone knows Maria's your daughter. Conceived while Mom was on her deathbed. But you weren't man enough to admit it. When were you going to tell us? Were we supposed to read about it in "The Memoirs Of The Great T Agustsson? Is that why you brought us here? T o tell us that? A confession to erase your fucking sins? T o leave us in hell while you stroll around in heaven? You didn't even have the guts to face up to the truth. Now you're hiding behind the "measures" for your antiquated freezing plant. How could you change anything? Nothing's happened inside your head since the 1950s! Sign the document. Are you so stupid you think I'll sign some document in the middle of the night? You're more stupid than I thought! I thought you'd see reason. Hand in your keys in the morning and clear out your office. Otherwise, that forged mortgage on this house goes straight to the police. You can't do this to me after all these years... Losing your nerve again? I've worked here since I was 10! If you don't sign, you'll be declared "non compos mentis". You won't be able to manage your affairs We'll have you certified as mad. After all, you went crazy years ago. You should've sold this shit years ago! But you'll carry on until some minister abolishes the quota! You'll be left with nothing to sell! Do you understand, or do you refuse to? You'll oppose us till you die? Sign, you senile fool! You can't oppress everyone anymore! Sign it! What do you know about me? You've never worked a day in your lives. What do you know about being faithful? You swap partners like you change socks. You don't know what it's like to live for ten years with a sick woman. That's what you wanted. You've never believed in us. We were never the way you wanted us. But we're exactly like you. We all look down on each other. We couldn't care less if the closest to us got raped. Maybe that's why you hate us. We're so fucking like you! Agust, wait! I'm your half-brother! I know and I don't care! I care! I care! You make a sorry sight. You're not the first person ever to have had a shock like this. He had a stroke, have you forgotten? Everyone says they've had one. They're just too idle to work. They'd rather sit all day eating fruit. Carry on talking while you're still around to. I'm not dead yet. I may well outlive you, sonny. In any case, I'm half-dead already. Don't souls go to heaven? I just hope they're not collecting souls from this rabble here. That would make a hideous sight. Shouldn't you get to bed? Thank you for coming so quickly in the middle of the night. There's talk of arson. Looks like it, but you can never tell. Won't the girl confess, then? She says she can't remember. Yeah, right She's claiming amnesia? The insurance company won't like it. You'll honour our agreement? We're talking about the quota? We're not interested in charred ruins and rusty boats. Isn't it a bit early? Kristin, give me 3 eggs and some pepper. You're going to stink out the car. You have no eggs? You're no guests of mine. I want my coffee now. Are you deaf? You're coming to Reykjavik with me. You're going to end up in hell, Kristin. We'll keep each other company there. They've gone, then. Did Maria start the fire? What do I know? What about the insurance? It was mortgaged to the hilt. But the quota? He gave the quota away. What? He gave it away? On condition it stays in the village. Who did he give it to? He trusted his worse enemy more than his own children. Cod quota, 183,243 tons. New position, 20,686 tons. Haddock quota, 282,624 tons. Current level... Damn it!
