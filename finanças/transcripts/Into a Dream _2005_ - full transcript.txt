Don't you guys get it?! - Now get the hell out of here! - I'm sorry, Sir. You stay, Suzuki. Ever been divorced? Ever been married? No, but I'm dating someone. How's that working out? Good? Bad? - Sir, this mark... - Get rid of it! Get rid of that shit! Get rid of that shit! What? You wanna get rid of me, too? What about you, Suzuki? What do you think? Anyway, what was I talking about? - Have you ever been divorced? - No. - Do you want to? - No. - Why not? I just don't want to. What do you think about life? I don't like it. Life is too complicated, isn't it? You love your wife? Wait, you're not married. Anyway... What do you think about this song? What is it you're looking for? Is it hard to find? 'lnto a Dream', right? You know it? - Sorry, am I crazy? - No, Sir, you're fine. - What do you think about the song? - It's very famous. - You know... I'm really depressed. Maybe we should postpone the show. - Teally? - No, not really! Suzuki, read this line right here. "When did I become someone I'm not?" "lt doesn't matter!" - Yes like that. - "lt does not matter!" "When I was in my 20s, life was full of possibilities. "l didn't choose this!" "It's the Venusians' fault!" What is it you're looking for? Is it hard to find? Even though you search in your bag and in your desk, but can't find it. Are you still going to search for it? Wouldn't you rather dance with me? Don't you want to try going into a dream, into a dream? I NTO A DTEAM I NTO A DTEAM I love you. My passion for you is... as hot as a virgin's blood, being drunk by a vampire. I love you too. My love will always surround you, like a forest. I deceive women. I'm not a good guy. Why? Because this city smells of gasoline. Men deceiving women, women deceiving men, as long as there is love, it's all innocent. I still remember the first time you touched me, awkward and innocent. You touched me like a girl playing the piano for the first time. Your fingers moved so gently. God, you suck! I'm not an actor any more. I'm only doing it 'cause you told me to. - I thought you'd be better. - How rude! You're so untalented, Taeko. You show no real emotion whatsoever. Still better than your recent work. That was so cheesy. That was just TV. Stop making excuses. I was so much better than her. I did it for you. "l did it for you"? It's so awful. Terrible! Life is wonderful! It stings. "When did I become someone I'm not? "lt does not matter. "When I was in my 20s, life was full of possibilities. "l didn't choose this. "It's the Venusians' fault! "A Venusian has taken over my body!" I'm a Venusian? I'm practising my lines! I'm a Venusian? - Am I a Venusian? - No, you're not. Life is so cool. Life is so hip. That bar was the worst. Let's not go there anymore. Suzuki! Hey, Suzuki! Stop undressing them with your eyes! - Hey, Chuya! - How you been, Suzuki? Good? Change your number? I tried to call, but I couldn't reach you. Sorry about that. - This is my co-star, Asami. - Nice to meet you. Likewise. Don't undress her with your eyes! Call me later. Take care, Suzuki. Bye. Condescending asshole! I'm older than him. Excuse me. Stella? I wonder if it's for me? I think it is, Blanche. I'm not quite ready. Shall we go, Blanche? Must we go through that room? I will go with you. How do I look? Lovely. Please don't get up. I'm only passing through. How do you do? You're not the gentleman I was expecting. - Did you forget something? - Yes! Yes, I forgot something! Miss Du Bois... - Ask her to let go of me. - Let go. Whoever you are, I have always depended on the kindness of strangers. Don't go. Don't go, Blanche. Blanche! Stella? Guys, we need to dismantle the set and we need your help. Hey, Tanko. Great job. I've never seen anyone play Blanche like that. It was really good. I love you. Good job. Good job. This is Mutsugoro Suzuki, the actor. He's coming to our wrap party tonight. Nice to meet you. - You're coming, right? - Yeah. I enjoyed the show. - Did you see me winking at you? - Of course. - You know, you've really grown as an actor. - Teally? Hey, everybody! This is Mr. Mutsugoro Suzuki! Maybe you guys should ask him for advice! - I saw you on TV recently. - Me too! - What was it? "Love and..." - "Desire". No, "Love and Cruelty". Pretty awful show, though. Did you have to do it? For the money? Shut up, stop being envious. - I'm happy to be doing Tennessee Williams. Tight? - Couldn't be happier. Cheers! What's wrong? A cavity. Feeling it with your tongue? I'll lick it for you later. That's all right. I have a long tongue. OK, maybe later. OK, let's go. We are dogs! Dogs, dogs, dogs! We are bitches! Got a problem? Oh my God! You're two beats late! What the fuck are you doing? Bam, BAM, and you come in! On BAM! Hey, Suzuki, what do you want? Get it right! Be alive! If you're not alive, you're zombies! Zombies! Tight now, you are dogs! Got it? Go crazy! You gotta shout! Understand, Suzuki? Ciao! OK, catch your breath! OK, let's do it again. We are dogs! Dogs, dogs, dogs! What the hell...?! I may have an STD... Can I be in your next play? Are you wasted? Hello? Keiji? I may have an STD. STD? STD? What are you talking about? Dad?! Mutsugoro, do you have an STD? What STD? It's just a line from my next movie. Sounds stupid. Tell them to write better dialogue. When are you going to be in a Disney movie? Disney movies don't have dumb dialogue like that. I'll be in a Disney movie next year. If you have time to be in a movie about STD's, you should study more. Yes, I'll study more. Anyway, you remember Yokota? The butcher's son. Next to the dentist's office. Yokota... Mitchan? He sent you a postcard here. Apparently, your class reunion is on Sunday. This Sunday? Why don't you come home for the occasion? Sunday? I don't know... This is your home, son. You have to come visit sometime. Yeah, okay, I'll think about it. What do you mean you'll...? "When did I become someone I'm not?" "lt doesn't matter..." "lt does not matter." Pick up, idiot! I'm 48 years old, but my work is all that matters to me. No time for women. Women are just an escape. - I really pity you, Suzuki. - Sure, I'm pitiful. Going after a young girl like her. - You're 30, right? - I'm 32. - Aren't you married? - No, stupid! I can see your bra... - and your big tits. - Shut up. Are you okay with all this, Tanko? You're the "other woman." Cheating is human nature! I wanna do it with Tanko too! What is it you're looking for? Is it hard to find? - It stings? - Yeah. Hey, you're the girl with the big boobs! Let me give you my number. Sorry, can I call you right back? Bye. I'm such a big fan of yours... Teally? Thanks so much. Give me a call. Call me. OK? - I'll call you. - Call me. - I'll call you. What was that "work is all that matters" bullshit? What a prick that guy was. So tired! - Want a beer? - Yeah. - But no light beer. - I only have light beers. OK, fine. Cheers! You were really good as Blanche. My name is Mutsugoro Suzuki, and this is my song. Check this out. You were 1 7 years old. Hey, that's me. Oh my God. You sound so young. My voice is weird. Hey, do you know 'Pop Con'? It's a contest, and I actually won with this song. I wrote it when I was 17. It's about my father. God, my voice is... creepy! It's cute. - Where did you get this? - What are talking about? You have your mail sent here 'cause you don't want your wife to see it. Not my wife. I'm not married. But, yeah, she reads my mail without permission. I would never do stuff like that. Don't. Why not? What? Tanko... Have you been with other guys lately? Like, that director Machida? 'Cause I saw him in the bathroom and... he looked like he was in a lot of pain. I think he has an STD. Also, that guy who played Stanley... what was his name, Ten? He was grimacing too. What are you trying to say? That I'm a slut, or something? Why do men think I'm a slut? They think that... but I'm completely monogamous. Since when? - What do you mean? - Since we hooked up? - I think so... Sorry, I wasn't doubting you or anything. Does your penis hurt? Well, yeah... What about other girls? - Not really. - "Not really"? - You mean Taeko? - You sleep with her? - No! - Since when? - A long time. - How long? - About two years. Anyone else then? No one really. I think you're hiding something. Who is it? Why don't you tell me who you've slept with? I slept with Machida. What? - How many times? - Twice. -Twice?! - 2 or 3 times... - Which is it?! What does this have to do with STDs? - Nothing, but why can't you be more precise? - I forgot. - When was this? - I forget when. People don't forget that. Women do forget. Unlike men. Fine. Who else? It's your turn to tell me. Me? Well... I slept with Yoko Takada. - Yoko Takada, your co-star? - Yeah. You slept with Yoko Takada? So you fucked her before coming to see me on Monday night? It wasn't Monday. But, on Monday night, you and Takada were on TV together. We didn't film on Monday. But it was on TV. On Monday! It was filmed earlier. It wasn't live! I know, but the show was on TV Monday night, and... I just can't believe you slept with me the same night your show was on. - What a nerve! - When did you sleep with Machida? - It's in the past. - It's all in the past! But you're saying, if Machida's play were on TV tonight, this would be immoral. Stop yelling. Let me just summarize. My dick has been hurting since yesterday. So, one of the girls I slept with recently must have... God, you're such an asshole. Look, I'm not saying you gave it to me. Even if you did give it to me, it doesn't matter. But I've only been with you and Takada lately. I'll get treatment, okay? We just have to make sure we're both clean before we can have sex again... I understand! I've been with Machida and Musashi. Musashi too?! What? You slept with Takada. - Musashi? That guy? - "That guy"?! - Not Musashi. - What about Takada? - Takada is better than Musashi. "Better"?! What do you mean, better? - Quality-wise. - "Quality"? - A better actor for sure. - What? What does acting have to do with sex? Don't give me shit. What does acting have to do with sex? Nothing. How does sex... better acting makes... if you're good in bed... - it means your acting is... - What?! You're not making any sense. Musashi is better in bed than you are! Oh, really?! Leave! - I'm leaving... - Get out of here! Asshole! - I'm never coming here again. - Don't! Go back to your little whore! You know what? Don't even get treatment! I don't have a disease! You should be asking Takada if she has it, that stupid cunt! Shut the fuck up! I'm definitely not coming here again. - Get out! - I'm going! - Hello? - Hi, who is it? - Hey, it's me. - What do you want? Did you give me an STD? What are you talking about? Hello? Stupid cunt... I'm home. I'm so wasted. I ended up going to their wrap party. It was mostly guys and... What are you doing? Can't you tell? - I'm leaving you. - Wait, don't go. - OK. - Eh? You looked surprised. You said, "Don't go," so I stopped. You thought I'd ignore you and leave anyway, huh? I thought you were really leaving. - Happy? - Eh? Do you want me to leave? Or, do you want me to stay? You should stay for now. Then I'll sleep for now. Why didn't you answer your phone? You called? Sorry, I didn't notice. Sato! Sato, wake up! Go, go, go! Hey, wake up! Nakamura! Nakamura! Hey! Nakamura! - Wake up, Nakamura! - I've been shot... - Oh, I was having a dream... - Motherfucker! Can I go back to sleep? Motherfucker... Wake up, Nakamura... Are you OK, Sato...? How long have I been asleep? 30 minutes? What a weird dream. Hey, I had a weird dream. Nakamura... Sato... and I'm Suzuki... Faster! Go faster! Hang in there, Sato! Nakamura! I'm fine. It's just a scratch. Let me sleep for a bit. Wake up, Nakamura! Motherfucker. Incredible! - It's incredible, Detective! - What are you smiling about? - It was a nice dream. - Is he OK? Let me tell you something... I've seen guys like you. You think you've got it all figured out. You think you've got it all figured out, and... you want to thank us for it. You may think you're unique, but you're not. You spend enough time here, you all start to think like this. - It's the devil making you all think the same thing. - It's not like that... Again? Aren't you going to answer? It's Suzuki, right? I don't care. Are you guys going to get married or what? No way. Every year, he says this will be the year, but it never happens. Are you guys breaking up? I don't know. He's a bad actor too. Teally? I thought he was the best in our troupe. The best? Chuya was much better. Chuya was good, but I liked Suzuki better. He was so intense. Have you seen him on TV lately? - Yeah. - And? And... it's just TV. God, Suzuki is persistent. Answer, damn it. It's just a soap opera. But your current situation is more like a soap opera. "When will you marry me?" "Not right now." "Don't you love me?" "Please. Stop." "Bastard." "l love you..." "but it's just too early to get married." Cut! Home... Taeko? - Hi, it's me. - Who? - You told me to call today. - Who...? We met last night at the party. Can you call back in a few days? Wait, hold on... Who was that? I gotta nap... Sato? Were you having a nightmare? - How's your shoulder? - This? It's just a scratch. - I had a strange dream. - A strange dream? Yeah, I had a strange dream. I was a mediocre actor... named Suzuki. - We were dating and living together. - Me and you? - Yeah. I was your girlfriend? - Yeah, you two should go out! - Shut up! Maybe we should start dating for real? Yeah, maybe. "It's such a smooth day. "lf there's something pointy in this town..." Guys! What the fuck are you doing?! Here he comes! - What's going on, boss? - Things changed. - Changed? - Sato's been shot, Boss. - Sato? Where is he? He's in there, moaning in pain. Boss, Sato is here. Are you all right? I'll be in a good movie next year. I love Disney movies, Boss. Sato, don't get up. - What's happening? - I'll go to the reunion. I'll stop by, Dad... I need to pee. - Hey. - Hey. How's it going? You're Mutsugoro Suzuki, the actor. - That's right. - See? - Can I have your autograph? - Sure. Tight here? - I watched your show on TV. - Thanks. You were so nasty in the final episode. I meant that as a compliment; your performance was terrific. - Shake my hand? - Sure. I'll be right back. It's chilly. I want you. Tight here. - What? - Kiss me, now. - Here, Suzuki. - Thanks. Cheers! - Long journey? - Sort of. - Where to? - My hometown. - Me too! - Teally? Nice to have something in common, isn't it? - Is it hot in here? - Not really. - It's hot, right? - I don't think so. It's hot. Oh, hey, I love that billboard! Man, it's hot. That billboard! I love that. I love that billboard. - It's hot, isn't it? - No, it's not. Don't touch me, okay? Don't touch! She's a slut, you know. She starts flirting with other guys when I'm not looking. Did she do something to you? - Not at all. - Stupid! My name is Yuji, by the way. Yuji! - Can I take it? - Yuji! This is Nancy. We've been living together for about five years. - Is it hot or what? - No. - It's not hot? - I don't think so. - lsn't it hot right here? - No, it's not. Tight there? Doesn't it hurt right there? Doesn't it hurt right there? No, it doesn't! It's the Venusians' fault. It's all the Venusians' fault. The Venusians? - Sit down. - C'mon, stay. - You want another beer? I'll go and buy it. - No thanks. - You sure? I didn't even drink the last one. Empty anyway, right? Don't touch me! What's up with him? Is he crazy? Let's continue what we were doing before. - He'll be back. - Do it. - Who are you people? We're members of the Space Society at our school. We heard rumours that a bunch of Venusians, disguised as humans, are hiding out in some small town. So we're on our way there. But I'm not really interested in the Venusians... because they don't have penises! - Don't unzip! - It's all right. - He's coming back. - It's all right. - Why? He's a coward. He's my slave. He can't come back until I give him a signal with my cell phone. Don't worry about him. It's just not right. - Let's do it right here. - I can't. - You can. - I can't. - You can. - Thanks. - Cheers! She's a pervert, isn't she? This area has changed so much. So much. - Will you get off? - No! It's the Venusians' fault. It's all the Venusians' fault. My hometown has changed so much too. This movie theatre became a supermarket. Completely different scenery now. Completely different. Fast food restaurants, coffee shops... everything's homogenized. Look at me. Look at my face. Haven't you seen this face somewhere? - No. - You haven't? I have. There are lots of guys who look just like me. They're everywhere. Same hairstyle, same clothes... What's so funny? Get off of me. I think I understand what you're saying. Starbucks, McDonald's, 7-1 1... Everywhere you go, it's all the same, right? No! Wrong! That's not it! I'm not some kind of franchise! - I'm me! - Okay! I am me! Got it? I'm not some kind of franchise! Understand? I may look familiar to you. Unlike you, I'm a nobody. I'm just some young guy, and you're an actor on TV. I'm the guy who does whatever magazines tell you. But I don't have to take any shit from you! - Yuji! - Shut up! Sorry. Everything's fine here. Please go back and drive. What role are you playing now? - A Venusian. - What? A guy whose body was taken over by a Venusian. - Let us see you act. - I'm not going to do it here. - Don't touch me! - Say some lines. Look, I have no idea how you guys ended up here, but it's all somehow related to this piece of dialogue: "When did I become someone I'm not? "lt does not matter. "When I was in my 20s, life was full of possibilities. "l didn't choose this. "It's the Venusians' fault! "When did I become someone I'm not? "lt does not matter. "When I was in my 20s, life was full of possibilities. "l didn't choose this. "It's the Venusians' fault!" What is that, Sato? I remember what I said in my dream. - Say "Blanche". - Blanche. You had an STD. What about me? You were a big-time actor, and you were driving a convertible. There was a beautiful actress sitting next to you. - That sounds great! - It was unreal. - A TV star, huh? - What about me? You were Taeko's best friend. Always talking about her relationship. - I'm the girlfriend, right? - Yeah, but we don't get along. Keiji! You were my childhood pal. - Same as in real life. - Boring. You were just a lunatic. - Is this dejs vu? - "Dejs view"? "View"? - Not "view". It's "dejs vu". - What about me? You had your miniature schnauzer and... "Miniature schnauzer"? And you were a famous theatre director. What about me? You were my father... and also a detective. Sorry I caused you so much trouble. "It's such a smooth day. "lf there's something pointy in this town... "l want to hang myself up there and writhe around. "On a slippery Sunday, where do I go? "The End." We may die tomorrow. - Hey, did you check everything? - All done. If we die today, there will be no job tomorrow. That's the reality. But we still have time, so enjoy it. But this here isn't reality, 'cause when you fall asleep, you actually wake up. We may all die in 6 hours. - How old are you? - 27. - Teally? - You're pretty old. What about you? - 24. We're all going to die before 30. - Early deaths. - Tight, premature deaths! That's fine, 'cause we're going to change this country. We're going to destroy the system and start a new country. Tight, Boss? The media calls us the Bin Laden of Japan, but fuck that! We're not Bin Laden or Aum or whatever. We are revolutionaries! - Tight, Boss? - That's right. - But it's not a bloodless revolution. - So what? That shit doesn't exist. It's all bullshit. Blood will be shed. It's because of gravity. Gravity! We're going to wage war against gravity... so that blood will not be shed anymore. This is the war to end all wars. We are the scab to stop the bleeding. The scab! We are the scab to stop the bleeding, which is caused by the senseless crimes of the world! - I have to go see if my penis still hurts. - Go ahead. Who cares? Just break all those toy guns. - Pull your pants up! - Shut up. - Stings? - No. Anyone in pain? - My glans. - My balls. - Everywhere. Your whole body? We want to feel a burning sensation too! - I want to pee standing up! - It's our privilege! - Women can pee standing up! - Women shouldn't. - Can I feel your warm pee? - Stop! Don't push! No pushing. Hey! Hello?! Hey, man. Come with me. If you come with me, it'll be good for all of us. Come with me to the place only I know. OK. Let's go. Pub "I Am" I saw you and... I knew you were... confused. Unsure of yourself. Just like how I used to be. How I was yesterday, how I will be tomorrow. I'm always so confused. What are you confused about? - Can I tell you? - Of course you can. Tomorrow... I'm going to kill somebody, get some secret document... and blow up the control centres for all cellular phone services. So, tomorrow, all the cell phones in Japan will stop working. Genius! That's awesome. Do it! I know the locations. Akasaka and the other place... but we need the instruction manual. So we'll just get it, right? But, no, my comrades don't want to just get it. They want to kill the guy too. The guy who's cooperating with us. Can you believe it? Killing the guy, so he won't be able to tell anybody about it. I don't want to do that. I can't take this anymore. I don't want to be a part of this group anymore. All companies are like that, though. We are not a company. Every organization is a company. The police, the government, religion... What do you do for work? Me? I work with the water and sewer systems... and repair old pipes and... You want to come see? Sure. It's here. Let's put on some music. There's no record on it. You'll hear it in your heart. 45rpm or 33rpm? 45rpm. Listen closely... Now you can hear it. I can't hear it. You'll hear it. I can't hear anything! Let's go. I can't hear anything! Come in. Be careful. It's scary. See? I fix stuff like this. Here, it's all rusted. This one's cracked... Iike you. I'm cracked? A lot of stuff is leaking out. - "Leaking out"? - Lots of stuff. - Like what? Like... your house and your eyeballs and... your fluids! It's your fluids leaking out! It's your cocktail! Your adolescence is apple juice. Your childhood is orange juice. Your adulthood is banana juice. They have been blended together and... it's leaking from this pipe. And it's my job to fix it. Then fix it. - Fix you? - Yes. Where? Earlier, I was bleeding from... right here. No. Tight... Here! - What?! - Your dick! - What? - Your dick! Your dick is messing up your life. Dick! Think about it. Dick! It's always your dick! You're the type of guy who cheats on his wife. Dick! When you're on a date, you think about other girls. Everywhere you go, dick! Always thinking about chicks. All those beautiful chicks. Dick! Thinking about chicks... you haven't even met. Dick! Dick! That's you. Dick! - You're right! - Tight, dick? - Yes! Dick! A dick doesn't care about overthrowing the government. What your dick wants to do is overthrow itself. What I mean is... your dick wants to become a good dick. Deep down... every dick wants to change. That's what it is. All these stupid dicks. All these diseased dicks. Sick... diseased... dicks! I mean... fuckers like you, who feel a burning sensation when they urinate. I see. Can you hear the music now? I can hear it. Go in that direction. What is it you're looking for? Is it hard to find? Even though you search in your bag and in your desk, but can't find it. Are you still going to search for it? Wouldn't you rather dance with me? Don't you want to try going into a dream? Into a dream? - Wake up! - Dad was singing! "The city smelled of gasoline..." Don't be poetic. Don't be poetic! - "l deceive women. I'm not a good guy..." - I know that, I know that. "l love you. My passion for you is as hot as the virgin blood..." Don't be melodramatic! Don't be melodramatic! Are you going to ask me for a cigarette now? You're so predictable. Don't think you're unique. When you see the Tokyo Tower, you'll say it's tall, it's awesome, and it's red. Same as everyone else. The sea is wide and blue, the sky is wide and blue. You're just an ordinary criminal with shifty eyes. You're scum as long as the sky is blue. As long as the sky is blue? When the sky turns black, it means you're reformed. Look... the only reason I'm here is because I have lived. It means I have lived a fuller life than you. You're going to die, without knowing what it's like to be interrogated. People like me... we are like seawater dripping from the earth's surface. We're not lakes and puddles and rainwater like you. We drip and... we spill out and... we fall everywhere. That's the only way we can prove ourselves. You people are... water contained in a glass. We are sewage, dirty water underneath the city. And I'm prepared to spill out all over you. Sir! Shit... It's my stop! McDonald's opened up? Painted it green? Hello? - Hello, son. - Long time, no see. - Yoko is at work. - Okay. When are you going to be in a legitimate movie? I'm trying real hard. You shouldn't be doing movies about STDs. You don't have an STD, right? Me? Oh, no. No way. Anyway... Nothing's changed, huh? Make me proud, you hear? You're my son. No more STD nonsense. STD? Go to the hospital in Ikebukuro. Hello? Hold on... Sorry about that. You have an STD? Anything coming out? Any red dots? Dark spots? Then I guess you're fine. North exit? Where? Toyo City? What are you doing there? Class reunion. Didn't you get the memo? Yeah, tomorrow. Mitchan. The butcher's son. Next to the dentist's office. You have to come. Maybe... A walk? I don't want to take a walk. No. I can't. No. 1 :30? OK. Ciao. What the hell?! It's unnecessary. It shouldn't be here. Keiji! How you been? What's happening? - What? - Get away from me! You can't contract an STD without having sex. Long time, no see. - McDonald's opened. - It's so unnecessary. - The town has changed. - I'm against that. Wanna go to McDonald's? I'm hungry. - Wanna go? - Sure. I'm getting a Big Mac! Let's go to the river! Hey, it's Kuroda's house. Kuroda! How's it going? His dad is weird. Yuji! Yuji! Yuji! What are you guys doing? I thought you were... I was over there. You scared us. - I saw you on TV. - Teally? - Yeah. - You come back, huh? - Class reunion is tomorrow? - You dyed your hair. - Cool, huh? Same colour as Dad. Look at his dad. Creepy! - Give me your autograph. - No way. - Me too, me too! - You shut up. Get me a pen and paper! Give me like five autographs. OK? So, what's the deal? - You guys came here together? - Is this dejs vu? - "Dejs view"? - It's "vu". - It's not "view"? - Who cares! I've been having bizarre dreams lately. We were all in this gang and... we were trying to destroy all cell phone networks in Japan. Also, you were on a train with some weird girl... saying, "I'm not some kind of franchise!" and "I'm me!"... - What? - On the train. What are you talking about? What's he doing? Keiji, are you listening? A Texas Leaguer is still a hit. - Who is it? Mitchan? - A former teammate. Get off the phone. I'm going to go. C'mon, let's go to the candy store. It's all right. I go there every day anyway. Every day? You love candy. Are you guys going somewhere now? Let's go to the candy store and say hi to that old lady. Does she still work there? - That old lady? - She died. - Died? - Her son Toru works at the store now. - Toru? - Who? - That kid. - You didn't know she died? - No. - I'm shocked. - Pretty sad. So sad. - Car accident. - Hit by a car? At the Shimizu intersection. Killed by a drunk driver. - Her body was thrown about 1 0 meters. - Teally? But it's all right, she was old anyway. - Anyway, let's talk tomorrow. - Yeah, tomorrow. Give me your autograph tomorrow. OK, but not five. Maybe three. Don't be a prick. "Not five, maybe three..." See you tomorrow. I may need to borrow your clothes. A tuxedo maybe? Tuxedo? Whatever. Later. See you later. I'm home. Hey, welcome back, brother. - How you been, Yoko? - Cold outside, right? - I'm making nabe. - What kind? - Fish and vegetables. - Put some cod in it. There's salmon and... Iots of mushrooms and onions and... What's with the make-up? - Too much? - Got a boyfriend? - No. - What about you? Any girl? - I do okay. You were a detective and were interrogating me. Sounds great. I have tons of questions I want to ask you. Can I go to your class reunion? - No, stupid! - Why not? It's just for those idiots. I guess. Idiots? Us? - What? - Can I come in? You can't sleep? I've been sleeping too much lately. You want to go for a walk then? - A walk? - Let's go. All right. Let's go out for a walk. We walked together in my dream. Maybe this is a dream, right now. Do you want this to be a dream? I don't know. Wanna stop by? No. Hey, asshole! Let me fuck your girl! - I'm gonna rape you, bitch! - lgnore them. - I will. Can I please come to your class reunion? It'd be weird if you come. But it's all just a dream, right? Maybe. It seems like I'm always in a dream state. Or you're always sleepwalking and being all weird. Like, last month, you told me to send your old tape to Tanko. - You know Tanko? - Of course. Whenever you get drunk, you always tell me how much you love Tanko. - Did you break up with her or something? - I did. - Why? I... "Life was full of possibilities. I didn't choose this." - What? - That's what you said in your sleep. That's just some dialogue. I know what you're going through. I'm 22 now. - Being 22 is complicated too. - Complicated? I don't know what's what anymore. I don't feel like I'm living the life I chose. - You're so corny. - You're corny too. - Corny is good, though. - Why? - Easy to understand. - Easy to understand? - It's better that way. - Why? My life has become too complicated. Mine too. Your life is simple. You don't understand. You don't get it. I'm complicated too. Complicated... What? It's no fun to be complicated. Better to be simple. - It's like a straight line. Simple. - Simple how? Like... those guys back there. - Them? - They're so simple. "I'm gonna rape you, bitch!" Sato, it's time! Wake up! - Should I bring this? - Fuck that shit! Let's go! "It's such a smooth day." "lf there's something pointy in this town..." Hey! Sandals?! We're going to be late. Why are you wearing sandals? Oops! That's them. There they come. Let's go. You stay here. You're no help. Get in! Quick! Come on! Boss, here. Mitch! Hurry up! - Hey, what the...?! - Let's get the party started! Mr. Big Shot! Let's have fun, everybody! Everybody! Cheers! - How old are you now? - I'm 22. - Stop bugging her. - I'm not doing anything. - Stop that. - I'm not touching her. Stop with the fan! What are you doing? Stop that! - Stop that! - What are you doing? "When did I become someone I'm not?! "lt doesn't matter! "l didn't choose this! "It's the Venusians' fault!" Get him some water! Hello? Now? Yeah, I'm drunk. Who are you talking to? I know. I'm in Toyo City, and I'm not in Tokyo. You're in Tokyo, but you're not in my room. You're sick and tired of me, right? I'm sick and tired of you too! Say something! Taeko! Let's break up. Fine. Goodbye. I just broke up with my girlfriend! Let's drink to that! - I'm going to wake up from this dream. - What? Dad, I promise I'll be in a good movie. - Disney? - Yes. - How's your miniature schnauzer? - Good. You're a fine director, Mr. Endo. I memorized all my lines, so there's no need to postpone the show. We'll put on a good show. Well... Goodbye. How about... How about something like this to conclude this dream? Are you okay? Taeko... Do you remember... what I said to you on our first date? Don't speak. I'm... a terrible man. I've made so many mistakes. It's okay. I've been lying to myself. I can't be honest with myself. But... I love you. Will you marry me? Sato... Sato... Sato... Sato... Sato! Sentimental bullshit, Sato! Sentimental bullshit, Sato! Sentimental bullshit, Nakamura! It fucking hurts! - Are you okay? - Shut up! Bunch of fucking bullshit! Where's he going? Fuck! What is it you're looking for? Is it hard to find? Even though you search... in your bag and in your desk, but can't find it. Are you still going to search for it? Wouldn't you rather dance with me?
