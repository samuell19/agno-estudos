Okay. Okay, okay. Okay. Oh, come on. Come on, open. No. Shit. Shit! Oh, God. Okay. A memorial service for Kurt Cobain was held today in Seattle, two days after the musician was found dead of an apparent suicide. That's not how fancy nannies dress. Come on, I'll take them. I'm a private tutor. Okay. Least you could do, leaving me without a roommate. I'm sorry for the short notice. They-they need me tomorrow. What about your class? I thought you love those kids. I do, but... the school's the one that put me up for it. Look, I couldn't say no, okay? A few years ago, this little girl lost her parents. And then now her nanny just abandoned her. So you're ditching me for a seven-year-old. You don't know what it's like to grow up without parents. Okay. And I love teaching, but... I want to make a difference, you know? So, you taking those with you? No. I think I'm kind of... looking forward to having a little break from these. She's been having a bad spell lately. But I'm gonna go see her tomorrow and say goodbye. Here. Are you gonna be okay when you're up there? My God. I'm going from 25 screaming kids to one little girl. How hard can it be? Hi, Mom. What are you working on? Hey, what if I help you move your stuff back into the art room? So... I'm leaving today. For the... the new job. You remember? I told you about that little girl, all alone with her housekeeper. Little girl? All on her own? Yeah. Well, that's a big responsibility. I know. I can handle it. You look... nice. Thank you. Here. Take this. It'll keep you warm. Okay. Love you. This can't be real. Flora leaves her toys everywhere. Don't be surprised if you find a Little Mermaid in your toilet. You must be Kate. Yes. Hi. Come along. Oh. Are you Mrs. Grose? I am. Oh, it's so nice to meet you. And it's just the two of you here? Cleaners and the gardener come in every couple of weeks. But, yes, it's just me and Flora while Miles is away at school. And this is where you'll give Flora her lessons. Have you ever been a live-in governess? No, no, not since the 1800s. Is that a joke? No, no, not a funny one. This is my first live-in job. Ah. Well, I hope you know what you're doing. The children are very special, Kate. They're thoroughbreds. Now, come along. I have something on the stove. It's so quiet. All the better to hear you when you get lost. Is that a joke? No. Mmm. That smells so good. I made this soup for Flora's father when he was her age. Oh, you've been with the family for that long? - That's quite a commitment. - It's an honor... ...is what it is. And may I ask how the parents died? They died in a tragic car accident, just outside the gate. Flora saw the whole thing. - That's awful. - Yes, it is. And it's hard for the children. Well, growing up without parents is... My father left when I was Flora's age, so... Is that right? Mmm. I'd love to meet Flora. Where might I find her? She's down at the stables. Just take the path around the back. Ah. Uh, may I? Of course. Flora? Flora? It's Kate. I came to say hi. Flora? Flora? Hi. Hi. Where were you hiding? Like I'd tell. Geez. He's not very friendly, is he? His name's Samson. He's grumpy all the time. He only lets Miles ride him. Ah. Ooh. And who's this? This is Delilah. She was my mother's horse. You can pet her on the nose if you want. Just be gentle, okay? She wants your apple. How did you know that? She is my favorite horse. Did you know that apples have cyanide in them? And the seeds are poisonous. No, I did not know that. How did you know that? She told me. Dr. Felicity Peppercorn Clock Watch. Oh. Nice to meet you, Felicity. That's quite a name. She's a veterinarian. Is that what you want to be? Or maybe a chef. - You could be both. - I would have to be a vegetarian. - Why is that? - I can't save animals, then eat them. Very true. Come on. Hold on. Wow. This maze is very complicated. Yeah. It's so big. You need to know your way around, or you'll get lost. One time, I couldn't find my way out, and I almost starved to death. What? Geez, your friends must love it here. I don't have any friends. You have no friends? Nope. Well, you might have one now. - Maybe. - "Maybe." Okay. I'll work for it. Okay. So, what, you're in ninth grade? Tenth? - Second. - Second? - Wow. - I could've skipped a grade if I wanted. Miss Jessel said I was an exceptional student. Wait, who's Miss Jessel? My teacher before you. She taught me French, you know. She did? Come on, slowpoke. And this mirror's from the 1980s. - Ooh. - That's my great- great-great-great-aunt Louisiana and her dog Otis. And that's the ship her brother died on. Guess what he had. He had dentistry. Dysentery? Yeah, that's what I said. That's Miles' room. And that's mine, next to it. Wait, wait. What's down there? That's the east wing. I don't go in that part of the house. Why not? Don't wanna. This is your room. I hope you like the bedding. This is my room? Yep. Wow. This is all for me? Yep. Oh. This is my great-grandmother Sophie. You stuffed your grandma? No, silly head. It's just supposed to look like her. Oh, I see. Well, she's, uh... she's creepy, huh? I think she's pretty. Do you want to see something else? Yeah. Behold! My great-grandmother's sewing room. My mother used to take me shopping when I was little. But after she died, Miss Jessel started making all of my clothes for me. Well, that one's beautiful. Miss Jessel never got to finish this one before she left. It was for my birthday. ♪ Hello...! ♪ ♪ I am ♪ ♪ A mannequin. ♪ Hmm. What is this? Um... yeah. Miles did that. I told him it was tacky. Yikes. Now, eat it all up. - Oh. - I have an idea. What if you and I took a little field trip to go get some ice cream before class started tomorrow? Uh, no. Flora doesn't leave the property. She has everything she needs here. What? Don't you, darling? She prefers my French apple tart, with a little bit of cream on the side. And you don't have to go anywhere for that. Do you, darling? No. You're gonna leave me, aren't you? What are you talking about? Miss Jessel left without saying goodbye. And now she won't talk to me anymore. You know, some people have a really hard time saying goodbye. But I bet she did it the way she thought would be best for both of you. Well, it's not easy for me. Let's get you to bed. Mm. Okay. Tucked in? - I like you. - I like you. And I'm not going anywhere. Promise, promise? Cross my heart and hope to die. Stick a needle in your eye? Mm. No. No, no. Maybe not that part. Okay. Oh, God. You are terrifying. So weird. God. Shh... stop. - Come here. - Peter. What are you doing in here? How did you get here? I said you need to leave now. You're gonna wake the children. The children are asleep. Don't touch me. No one needs to know. Please stop. Keep your eyes closed. In here. Just get in bed with me. No, Peter. Stop, you're scaring me. You're hurting me. You better go. Last kiss. Stop it. Please go. Leave me alone. - I'm not going anywhere. - You're hurting me. Don't touch me. Who are you? I'm Miles. I live here. I mean, um... uh, what are you doing home? You shouldn't be in here. I... I know. I thought I... heard something. You should go to bed. "Monday, March 6. "Flora got 100% on her state capitals quiz. I am so proud of her." "French library terms." "Reading in French today.

We met. I'm really sorry about last night. Uh, I didn't... I didn't mean to be rude or anything. Sorry if I scared you. Oh, it's fine. Cool. So, seems like you had a rough night. You're a sleepwalker, like Flora. - I don't sleepwalk. - How would you know, silly? You're asleep the whole time. I just know. - That's a cool sweater. - Thanks. You shouldn't be wearing that. He wanted me to have it. - Was it your dad's? - It was Quint's. - Who's Quint? - He was the riding instructor. He managed the estate. He was the best. Oh, and he's not here anymore? He died. Oh. Everyone dies, Miles. So, do you ride horses? Oh. Uh, well, I rode a couple times at summer camp. Hello. Fairchild residence. But that's a lie. I just stayed on the horse. - I can teach you if you want. - Yeah? - Who? - I mean, if you can handle it. Oh, is that a challenge? Yeah. Uh, no, I think I can handle it. - Please hold. - Yeah, I'm a... - I'm a quick learner. - Kate! It's the headmaster at Miles' school. He would like to speak with the person in charge of us. Uh... Yes, fine. Better take that. Hello. This is Kate. So, Miss Flora, are you forgetting your breakfast? - Uh, I... - Yes? Well, let me cut it up for you. Okay. Um, thank you for letting us know. So, what did old, uh, fragile Farty want? He, um... He gave me a list of some of your schoolwork to complete while you're home. Okay. That sounds fun. Great. Where are you going? To my room. What about your plate? - What? - Your plate. Aren't you gonna take it to the kitchen? Want me to cut the grass, too? No. But Mrs. Grose prepared a beautiful breakfast for us, and it would be the polite thing to do. That's her job, right? - Miles. - It's fine, Miles. I'll do it, darling. You go on ahead. Come on, Flora. Let's go. It's not your job either, Flora. They were born into privilege, Kate. Can you please remember that? Miles was expelled. He attacked another student. He what? Yes, apparently a teacher found him with his hands around another boy's neck, slamming his head into the bathroom tile. Oh, absolutely not. No, he wouldn't do that. He did, and it sounds like he's very lucky that the other boy's family isn't pressing charges. Yes, well, other boys, Kate, have always been jealous of Miles. - Here, let me help you. - No, thank you. This is my job. You do yours. And what's that lava that sits in the volcano called? Um... it's magma. Mm. Yeah. Ouch. It is "ouch." Super hot. Flora? Yeah? Does Miles get in trouble a lot? Miles is the best. Stop it! Thank you. Flora, back to work. Miles? Don't you know how to knock? Do you have a friend in here? What do you want? Sorry. I thought I saw someone... come in here. There's no one in here. It's just you and me. Okay. I think we... got off on the wrong foot. You're new. I accept your apology. It's interesting. Yeah, she's just... Well, there's two of them. Oh. I thought it was just the little girl. So did I, but the brother is back from boarding school, and I think he hates me. I knew it sounded too good to be true. Still happy you went? Oh, yeah. Sorry. It's great. So focus on the positives. Don't let this kid get under your skin. Working on it. Tell me about the house now. Are there, like, creepy suits of armor or paintings with eyes cut out? Or a crypt in the basement? Yeah. Hello? Kate? You're not listening to me. No, I am listening. Help! So, remember that guy Tanner? We went to that bar on 14th a few weeks ago. Well, he finally called me back, but, but now I don't even think it's worth it, so, um... Oh, my God. I got to go. No! We got you. We got you. We got you. We got you. What? Both of you in the house now! What on earth happened to you? Ask the thoroughbreds. What? What are you doing? There was a spider on you. It was crawling up towards your face. When my door is closed, I'd like you to knock. Your light was on. I thought you'd be awake. You're scared of the dark? I'm sorry. I haven't made the best impression, have I? To be honest, you haven't. Miles. What happened at school? Why did you hurt that boy? He burned... every one of the pictures my father sent me. I miss him. You need to go to bed. Can I still give you your riding lesson tomorrow? Sure. Head up. Thighs against the horse. Sit in the center of the saddle. You'll get better balance. Ride harder. Put your thumb on the top of your reins, and your pinkie on the bottom. - Don't let her get the bit. - Okay, I'm not. Rein her in hard. Well done. You didn't have to keep whipping her. Yes, I did. You wanted to learn. That's how Quint taught me. It's a strong animal. If you don't exert power over it, then you'll never gain control. You look good up there. Miles. I'm bored. Can we do something else now? What do you want to do? Can we show Kate the koi pond? It's Flora's favorite part of the garden. Let's check it out. Look. That koi is, like, bumping into the wall. Like, ga-dah. Okay. She's trying to make her great escape. Maybe she wants to be a flying fish. Make a wish upon the rock. I wish this... 25 years. What if you lived to be, like, a hundred? ♪ Ah! ♪ This is so pretty. - Miles! - He's got a fish! Stop! Get the hell off of her! - Aw, poor baby. - Aw. Miles. What are you doing? Nothing should have to suffer. That was my favorite fish. Now you've seen the koi pond. Ah, I love this tea party. Me, too. Hey, don't drink out of my cup. Oh, I'm sorry I didn't give you any tea. Oh, my... Miles. Flora. Just checking you were still here. Still here. Miles' effects from his school arrived this morning. Oh. - Mrs. Grose. - What? Do you ever hear...? I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you. You're it! Guys, it's very early. - Can you stop? You guys. - Children, can you listen to Kate? Listen to Kate, please. You need to take charge here, Kate. Bad dreams? I have an idea. Since it's Saturday, why don't we go into Millbrook and get a new koi? Hmm? Yeah. I don't want to. Come on, it'll be fun. You know that Flora doesn't leave the property. You don't have to go, darling. What if I asked my special friend, huh? Want me to try? Will you keep me and Flora safe? You will? - And Kate, too? - And Kate, too? Really? He says you have nothing to worry about. Okay. So, go get your coat. Good job, Miles. He also thinks your tattoo is sexy. Please stop. I don't want to go. Oh, no, honey. We're almost at the gate. We'll be fine. I don't want to go. Stop! Hey. What are you doing? - I want to get out. - Flora. - Stay in your seat. - Stop the car. No, leave your seat belt on. - Sit down, Flora. - Miles, tell her to stop or I'm gonna die. - Stop the car. - Miles, I don't want to die. Stop the car or I'll fucking kill you! I told you to stop. Hey. Flora. Oh, Jesus. Oh, come on. I know what you're afraid of. Keeping the lights on won't keep you safe. Flora? Flora? Leave her alone. Flora, can you look at me? She doesn't want to talk to you. You terrified her. Where'd they find you, anyways? You know, you need to stop talking to me like that. You're not our mother, you're not our family. Stop pretending to be. I... I'm leaving. Yeah. Just leave. Leave like everyone else. This is Rose's assistant. How may I help you? Hi, Rose. Hey, Kate. - You okay? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm great. Um, how are you? It's so nice to hear your voice. Uh-oh. What's wrong? Actually, it's, um, it's a little tough here. The... the boy hates my guts for some reason, and the little girl isn't speaking to me, so... I'd like to think it's nothing that I'm doing, but... maybe it is. Or maybe they just don't want me. I don't know. I don't know. It's really, um, hard here. I think, uh... I think maybe I can't stay. Then don't. Bail. They can find someone else and I can have my roommate back. No. I can't. I made Flora a promise. And I crossed my heart and hoped to die. Hi. Can I sit? That's better. Hey, Flora. I'm sorry that I didn't stop when you first asked me. It's really not nice not to be listened to. Have you ever heard of a brave face? Hmm? I'm actually wearing mine right now. Can you see it? I don't see anything. That's good. Because it's invisible. So if you saw something, it would mean it was broken. My mom showed me how to make one, so I can do it for you if you want. I've actually been wearing mine since I was way younger than you. - Really? - Yeah. What do you think? Should we try? I just have to... do a quick scan of your face to make it first, okay? Blow. Good, good, good. Oh, that's a good one. - Yeah. - That's really... you got - a good face for it, yeah. - Yeah. So I'm gonna get all of my bravery and all of yours and mix it together... and get it into my fingertips. Okay. Looks good. So let's see. Show me your brave face. Flora, come on. You've got a, a wild animal inside you... let me see you roar. Roar! Ha! That was a huge roar. I've never seen a brave face take so fast. Should we test it out? Should we see - if we can see ourselves in the water? - Yeah. Roar! Hi. Um, I-I got you something in town. It's, um... This... it's just this great album. Thanks. So, I know how close you and Quint were. Yeah. He was my friend. Yeah. That must've been really tough. Do you want to talk about it? Not really. Well, you know, something kind of similar happened to me when I was your age, and I'd wished I had someone to talk to. Okay. Look, I'm not trying to replace Quint. Can you stop? Miles. Can you please stop? We need to talk. Oh, you're back. I thought we'd lost another one. Is Miles the reason Miss Jessel left? Miles? Don't be ridiculous. Then why? It was Quint. There was something going on between them. Could tell by the way he looked at her. That's not a reason to run away. Well, I gather things went south with them. Why? Because he was a brute. When the parents died, he walked around this place like he owned it. Even moved himself into the master suite. He was disgusting. How did Quint die? He had an accident couple of weeks after Miss Jessel left. Fell from his horse, drunk. Died in the dirt like the animal that he was. How was he with Miles? Well, he was a terrible influence. He used to take Miles and disappear with him for hours. Miles was such a sweet boy. The Miles I've met is not a sweet boy. Well, that is really no concern of yours, is it, Kate? Then whose concern is it? I mean, it certainly doesn't seem to be any of yours. Quint sat next to me at dinner, reeking of whiskey. He won't leave me alone. Mrs. Grose won't do anything to help. I have to sleep with my door locked. Quint tried to come in in the middle of the night. I can barely focus on my lessons now. I feel Quint's eyes on me all the time. I woke up to a photo that Quint left on my bed. I don't know how he got in. I'm not safe. I have to leave. Miles, come back! Miles! Talk to me! Miles! Wait! Stop. You're hurting me. Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. Flora. Can you paint at your desk, please? I paint better over here. No, you're gonna get paint all over the floor. Okay, fine. I'm finished anyways. Want to see? Sure. What is this? Me and Miss Jessel. Can we play flashlight tag now? No. But you promised. Yeah, Kate, you promised. You don't want to let Flora down, do you? You promised. You promised. You promised. You promised. You promised. You promised. - You promised. You promised. You promised. - Okay. - Okay, okay, okay, okay. - You promised. Just... - What are the rules? - Turn off all the lights. You have to find us with this. If you flash us, we're dead. You're it. Call out the state capitals. No peeking. Come on, come on, come on! Alaska. Juneau. Arizona. Phoenix. Gotcha. I'm dead! I'm dead. Oh! I'm dead. Ah! Is Miles down there? Maybe. You want to come with me to find him? I can't. I'm dead. Miles! Okay, I don't want to play anymore. Miles? Hmm. Can you make the moves? - No. - No. Can I even play? Can you just... just stop! Stop it! This isn't funny! You... - You! - Kate. Oh, my God. What happened to your face? Explain yourself. I was hungry? I am sick of the games! Don't talk to them like that. He has been terrorizing me since day one! Don't be ridiculous. He's been here with me for the last 15 minutes. The only person doing the terrorizing round here is you. Now what are you doing? Yeah. Bad dreams? I'm gonna sleep with you, okay? Come on. This came for you. Did you open my mail? It came like that. Who is Darla? My mother. Oh, I see. Well, we can't choose our family. Whatever your mother has, let's hope it's not genetic. Yeah? Kate... I need you. Mom? Oh. Uh, I can't talk right now. They're gonna throw me out. What? Uh, Mom. I think I'm seeing things. Did you look at the drawings? Yeah. - Darla. - Mom? Mom! Kate. Flora? Flora? Miles? You're gonna wake the children. The children are asleep. I said you need to leave now. Let me go, let me go. No, stop. Stop. No. No! Yes. Yes. Oh, my God. Kate. Kate. Kate. It was him. It was Quint! What are you talking about? Quint murdered Jessel. I saw her body in the bottom of the lake. You stop now. You stop telling tales. You knew. You knew Quint killed Jessel. Look. Quint's dead. I made sure of it. Where are the kids? You stay away from them. They're not safe! I should never have let you in here in the first place. You knew. You knew. You never did anything. I've been protecting this family for a lifetime, and I won't let you near them. 'Cause you're mad, Kate. Move! Flora! Oh, Flora. Oh... Are you okay? I'm scared. Okay, do you still have that brave face? I need you to put it on, okay? It's good? Okay, let's go. Where are we going? Everything's gonna be fine. We just need to get to the car. I don't want to die! I don't want to leave! Flora, come back. Miles? We have to go. We have to get Flora out of here. Hey, Miles, listen. It's Quint. I thought I was going crazy, but I'm not. He's here. Oh. You know that, don't you? Mrs. Grose is dead, isn't she? Yeah. We need to leave. No. I can't. I'm sorry. For everything. Flora won't leave without you. We need to go. I can't. He won't let me leave. How long until he hurts Flora? Please, Miles. Miles. Please. Open the door! Okay. Okay. Okay, stay down. I need you to be brave, okay? Okay. Come on. Come on, open. - Come on, come on, come on. - Come on! Okay. Whatever your mother has, let's hope it's not genetic. I guess you can't escape the inevitable. No, stop it. I'm serious. You shouldn't be going into her room. You have to trust me on this. Shh. I can hear her. Play it cool. She's coming. Miles, what's wrong with her? She looks scary. What are you guys doing in here? I want to go. What's wrong? Shh. Flora. Flora. Flora? Did you see Quint in the mirror? I know that you saw him. Yes, you did. I saw you. Quint's dead. You saw him, too. No, I didn't. Why are you lying to me? I saw him. I know you saw him. I didn't see him! Just tell me that you saw him! Flora, tell me you saw... You broke her! - She's broken. You broke her! - I can, I can fix her. Just let me... No, you can't! You broke her! - Flora, it was an accident. - You broke her! You can't fix it. She's broken. Just like you. Come on, Flora. Why is Kate crazy? I don't know. Well, that's a big responsibility. Miss Jessel left without saying goodbye. - It was Quint. - I know what you're afraid of. You need to take charge here, Kate. Just checking you were still here. You're not our mother, you're not our family. - Stop pretending to be. - He's been terrorizing me - since day one. - The only person doing the terroizing round here is you.
