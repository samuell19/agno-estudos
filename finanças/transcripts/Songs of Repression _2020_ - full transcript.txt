How is this for filming? Should we use the bench too? Just position yourselves in a way that you feel comfortable. Yes. We mustn't flatten the grass so much. -Why? You won't see that. -Who knows. Is this good, or...? The big cushion for the bench is here. -Should we use the bench too? -Look... -Just put it there. Not so far back. -And take the table. Can I leave my hat on or should I take it off? -It looks better off. -It doesn't look good on film. -And adjust your jacket a bit... -Okay. -That doesn't look good. I mean... -I have to look fine. -It should look good, right? -It might annoy you when you see it. Schorsch, sit down. Elisabeth, did you put your hair in your collar? The day has come... Factories are lining up. And then I don't remember how it continues. -Factories... -The milkers are working -That's a different verse. -It is? -No. Then you get Saws ... - Are hammering. No. -No. Saws are singing... -Hammers are hammering. Framed by high mountains Beautiful Valley, there you are Mountain streams flow around you Fields blossom in the valley Lavadero, our new home Chosen only for a few Where the turbines always run Where the wheels always turn You, my beloved Machine Valley I filled up my cart. Full of stuff. -Good morning. -Good morning! -Yes. -Good morning. -Good morning. -Hello, Dora. See you soon then. I'll be there. -We'll come and visit you. -Bye. We give whatever we can to the kitchen. Lettuce throughout the winter, parsley... Chives. And what's it called... Cilantro. What's that called? -Coriander. -Coriander, yes. You can't say it was all bad. When we drove into the fields, we almost always sang. We'd all sit together and go through one song after another. That was something beautiful. Or in the evenings, when we'd go home in the darkness, we'd sometimes lie on the hay wagon and look up and observe the stars. Or we'd sing lovely evening songs together. This one was outside for too long, unfortunately. It got frostbitten. But I reckon the leaves will fall off and new ones will grow. -With or without the hat? -As you wish. We don't need to put make-up on you. It's an infamous part of the history of Villa Baviera, which was called Colonia Dignidad at the time, and many people are still suffering from it today. And of course everyone describes it in the way they see fit, however a journalist wants to paint it, but I think, come here and talk to us directly. We're happy to talk about the reality. We're no... Not a... Do you have time to help out? -Yes. -The high voltage cable has broken. Should we... SILENCE IS STRENGTH Yes. We can put it on... ... here. Yes. My name is Maria Schnellenkamp. I'm a nurse. I studied in Concepci?n, in the south of Chile. I've worked here for 13 years. My children are growing up here. This was always my dream job. But being a mother was too. Juggling both things at the same time is not that easy, but I manage. This is the stretcher I was born on 49 years ago. My birthday was recently. And we're twins. This is in remembrance of my mother. This lovely picture. She worked at this hospital. Yes. The nurses wore these uniforms. Or the assistants. Right? But that's not the case today. And after all that happened, we don't want them anymore. I think that's self-explanatory. Stephan, it's... It's like this. I came here when I was 34 years old. I left home when I was 17. Because I... Because I joined the community. So... It was a small group. I experienced God with this small group. And that was the beginning. I... I was in my best years. I could've stayed there, gotten married or whatever. But I didn't want to. I didn't want to. I wanted to come here. I always tell people. I don't want to sugarcoat things, or throw out the bad things. I mean, by not mentioning them. I say that I know... that a lot was bad... Although I was hardly affected by that. Except for the things I personally experienced. But we were not affected by what was generally going on. Hello. Okay. -Who was that? -The Prince. Horst Schaffrick, that is. Helga's husband. -Why is he called The Prince? -It's a nickname. He used to... The boys all used to sing. There's this lullaby, "Sleep, my prince, fall asleep". And he used to sing that. As a boy. With such a high... Girls couldn't sing it as high as he did. That's where he got the nickname The Prince. You have to tighten it. Like this... -Now? -No. Shouldn't we do a double one? It's better twice, okay? Show us your Poke Ball. Dad. -We were repairing it earlier. -Yes. Come here. It was bad, because it had a bump. We had to open it up and repair it. That's another ball? You put something over it? Yes, it's a tennis ball. -You put a balloon over it? -Yes. It's from a game. I'm going to play with Benjamin now. You're going to play with Benjamin. Okay then. I still have... so many horrible nightmares... About all these... ... rounds, where one person stood in the middle, and was pulled about, called to account, forced to answer. He'd get horrible beatings. Once, when we were in a singing lesson... I got beaten so much, hit on the ears, that I lost consciousness and fell to the ground, and was bleeding. They'd broken my jaw. And then... They said, "Get up, you scoundrel! You liar!" And then he started kicking me. That was during a singing lesson. The workers. We built a nice swimming pool, did you see? For the kids. What is it? What's up? It's closed. What's up? -Good afternoon. -Hi. -May I? -What? -Work? -Inside? Oh, sorry. Did you have breakfast? I had a piece of cheese and some coffee. He's more stable now. He was very nervous, very restless. That's why the doctor increased the dose. What about decreasing the dose of Alprazolam? -Half in the morning and one at night? -That's fine. Yes. -It's a lot, and this drug... -Drugs are not good for... No drug is good for one's health. Alprazolam can affect your memory. You start to forget things. -That's why high doses are not good. -Yes. -Right, okay. -You'll get your medication tomorrow. -Yes, okay. Thanks. -You're welcome. Right. Horst. please. -Yes. -It's your turn. How are you feeling? -Your head? -A bit better. My headaches are not as bad. All right. Let's take a look. Yes, it's better. You could climb over this easily. The wire was here. And you'd be gone. It wasn't like this at the time, of course. It was open here and you'd go down to the stream, without any thorn bushes. And I'd get across quickly and easily. The first cars then followed me. I threw myself into the grass, the car went past, and I saw the people looking everywhere, and drive past. And then... they caught me anyway. And then the questions came. "You want to leave the House of God and are going to Hell." Something like that. That was the decision. I was the traitor. So I better never try to escape again, but two years later I tried again. Shall we take some pictures of this beauty? Gosh, it's... And then? What punishment I received? First of all, they put me in hospital and gave me an injection. It was a huge syringe. First a small one to numb my arm. And then I was put to sleep for two or three days. Then they gave me electric shocks. They all meant well really. They probably thought we were criminals and needed electric shocks. Some situations call for that. Maybe not with us, but... I'm sorry about it, but... Today, this place looks beautiful, almost like a paradise, I say. Now it is. I do this in my break, when I'm relaxing. That's when the swing is most important. It helps me a lot. To come down from all the stress. Some people laugh at me, but I find this very pleasant. Work is work. Relaxing is relaxing. So awaken, awaken, child So spring won't find you sleeping So spring won't find you sleeping Hello. You're on time. This happens again and again. Yes, I... I should've been here a lot earlier, but at the moment... -You have a lot to do? -My blood pressure is running wild. Sometimes it's too high, sometimes too low. It's due to stress. When I don't sleep enough, I quickly end up in this situation. We worked so hard in our lives that we are rather... run down, or how should I put it? We can't handle so much. -So the consequences are showing? -Yes. That you... That you... Me anyhow. I was always very sensitive. Everything stressed me out a lot. Even as a child. That affected me. I burst out into tears quickly. I can understand that. Those times are over. I just wanted to explain why I... There's a bit of dust on it. When did we play last? 2008? 2005. 2005, perhaps. 2004. I can't play a melody anymore. When the music sounded well, it was nice in the orchestra, but it was always linked to a dark background, like everything here. From the outside, everything was supposed to look good. And what was going on inside was going on in the entire system. In the choir, in the orchestra... Everywhere. At the hospital... And then you always had to report. Report when you got beaten, and that would often be constantly. In the morning, you wouldn't know if you'd get beaten in the evening. And it lasted forever. It was not just a few lashes. Sometimes it would last half an hour, at least. And then you knew you had to report to Sch?fer. And then he'd always do this thing where he'd ask, "Where have you been touching yourself?" Self-discovery, which is normal for children, discovering your body, that was out of the question. Then he'd push you into a corner or a narrow hallway, and then... "Where were you, what sinful things did you do?" That's what he'd ask. "What sinful things did you do?" Sometimes I didn't know what to say, you know? I hadn't done anything. And... "If you don't tell me, I will beat you up." It was insane. You would just say whatever... It repeats itself again and again. Almost every night, in my dreams. I see these places and say... Thoughts come up. I still dream about the system at night. I see Sch?fer and a group of beaters. I think many... Many people did it to curry favor with Sch?fer. They'd be honored. "You stood up for the truth. The man lied, or the man was bad, and you beat the evil out of him." Many people made a name like that. And for Sch?fer it was a pleasure when he'd sit here and see people getting beaten, which happened every day. If nothing happened for a day or two, it was like something was missing. He was a monster. A Nazi. A Hitler type. To put it bluntly, a Hitler type. But... He didn't do this alone. No. The problem is he didn't do it on his own. And... There were others who could have intervened. They didn't ask, "Why am I supposed to beat you?" They just did it. They probably enjoyed it. You can't say that to people's faces, but I think there were people who were on the ready with their bat, or their rope. When I saw the rope, I knew they'd beaten up someone again, sadly. Enough. For now. This looks good. The sound is running too. -Who's starting? -You. Life... Life together... Although we were a group, what happened was... and I especially value all that now, that a lot was chipped away, of one's being, one's own will. You learned to subordinate yourself. Not necessarily by force, but... to deal with other people... It was often the case that I was feeling stubborn and didn't want to be ordered around, and I would talk back, and I felt resentment. But then I learned to bow down. To accept, to be able to subordinate oneself, that is very important in a community. If you live together as a group, and we really learned to do that as children. To accept what the adults told us, our superiors. And to do what they told us. And to not answer back. To do what was demanded of us. And especially... to tell the truth about everything. And... if you then... got into an argument with someone, to make up, and not remain in a fight, and feel resentful towards the other... And these values, which Paul Sch?fer also passed on to us, who was among us, and we respected him very much, in the good things we experienced, and it was not by force. In this respect, I want to say that I'm grateful for those values. That we can differentiate between good and evil. That we know what... Also in music. He played harmonica a lot. He still does. Yes. From time to time. -But in the past... -Play something now? The little one. Good. -Warming up? -I'm warming it up in my hand. It took me three or four years before I even dared to think about "the man of God", Sch?fer, critically. Or to express some negative opinions about him. In terms of the abuse of boys, we didn't know what was going on. We didn't know anything about sexuality, reproduction, men and women. And for me to understand... that he'd been doing these devilish things with us, that took me years. And whenever I heard a comment somewhere, I would... I just left. I still wasn't able to process it or recognise it. Yes... We were beaten and crippled and we had to forgive, and that's it. How are we supposed to live our lives now... Is that not of any interest? And that's where I think that as a Christian... You have to realise, "We caused so much damage here. How are we going to repair that? How do we do it?" And not say, "Let's forgive", and raise our hands in the air. No. And that's why inside the "community"... I can't stand that word anymore, opinions widely differ. Our paths have totally parted here. Dora. When Sch?fer's time came to an end, an open conflict broke out between you. Many left the colony. Wasn't that hard for you? Yes. Yes, there are... Those who cannot see where the truth is, think we are wrong. And we see... We who are enlightened, whose eyes have been opened by God, know what is right or wrong. It's so evident to us, so we have no doubt. The others don't understand. This lack of understanding has that consequence. But the conflict still continues today. -In...? -Although you... The unity, the community? Yes. And we can only achieve this... through our example. A true believer loves every human being and tries to win them over. And one can only do that by setting an example. Only God can guide one's heart. Glorious mercy, so wonderful Is offered to everyone in Golgotha Mercy flows through the lamb's blood So accept it and everything will be good Mercy, mercy Thomas. Maybe you can start by describing your role in Villa Baviera. Yes. -So... -I just need to quickly drink something. Yes. My function here in Villa Baviera is that I'm a member of the directorate. I'm the CEO of a number of operative and service-oriented companies. My vision is to make this place a very open village in ten to 15 years, where we will be good neighbours of Chileans and other friends. That was always my vision. The mystical aspect of this place, it being a little bubble, or a closed community, will dissolve. Hello, good morning. How are you? How was the breakfast? Good? I always say life has changed here. And we need to do something with our history. In the end, we are fine, we are free. That's the most important thing. Today I can talk to you. In the past, I couldn't. That's the swimming pool. There are also hot tubs, wooden barrels. No thermal baths, but hot water with a hydromassage. At the hotel, you'll see it's open all year, for the family. The hot tubs are now free to use. During high season, they're half price. This is the garage. Here are the workshops. This is the bakery where they make cakes, breads, biscuits... -Can we buy something there? -All products are at the grocery store. This afternoon we'll go to the chicken farm. Anyone who wants to buy eggs can buy them there. This is the hospital. It is private upstairs. And a retirement home for our older ones. The tent is used for wedding parties. When there is a wedding, the couple's room is included in the price. Let's go into the museum. You can take pictures here. These are pictures from Germany, and these were taken here. The exhibition shows that all the people who arrived in Chile were involved in World War II. That made things easier for Paul Sch?fer. But no one knew about what he was doing with the kids. It's upsetting, but... But I say, now he's buried under the earth and we're free. And I'm happy. -Hello, good morning. -Good morning, Acki. -Long journey? -Yes. Hello. -They want you to join the choir? -Of course! Of course. They're crazy. All this nonsense. I've really had enough of it. I've totally distanced myself from it. So have we. If we want to sing together, we need to be of one mind. And we should have spoken the truth about all the injustices. And not just stand there as if nothing happened, and sing in the choir together. They don't need to invite me to that. Like I said, the choir... The choir, the orchestra, used to just be a pretty facade. And how is it today? Tourism. "Look how lovely it is here!" It's not easy. Although there are a lot of advantages here. -This is all you harvested? -Yes. -No more? -No. -It's not much. -We started in 2010. We became self-employed then. Last year we had the best harvest in ten years. And this year it was the worst. How is life outside for you, Acki? You left the colony. Well, like I said... I live from hand to mouth these days. You live to pay for the house, where the family, the kids, live. You have to pay for food. I worry about something bad happening, how to deal with it? Like if I have to pay for a hospital or something, then what? There's always this fear. "What then?" As I stayed here, I have the advantage of not having to pay for everything. To live here is paying for food. People like you, who left, are faced with costs everywhere. I have that advantage. It's all for free. Starting something for yourself here is very different to when you leave and have nothing whatsoever. They're hotel guests who are leaving. They arrived yesterday. I served them. They're leaving now. The ground floor is bigger and has more amenities, but up here you can be comfortable too. -Hello. You're leaving? -Yes. -Was everything fine? -Yes. See you around. You'll take the lift? Press number one. Right. This used to be the kitchen cellar. The storage room. Where the apples and everything were stored. Afterwards it was basically just used as a garbage dump. It was like hell. It was such a mess. We then made... I mean, my boss and I made a nice sauna. Little Tirol, our new sauna. It has a lot of nature. The tourists should feel comfortable. This will be a good... A good job. A hot sauna, I know this myself, is good for one's health and... a good life. Who knows what went on in this cellar? First it was a storage room and then it was... It was a place where you would hide or where you were punished, and today it's a sauna. Please give a warm welcome to Michaela and Jos?! Husband and wife! You're still sleeping so deeply. -Not at all. -Not deeply? -Did you sleep well? -No. You didn't sleep well? We're adults now, but not everyone can digest and process what happened. Many left because they wanted to forget the trauma they experienced here. They needed distance. I had a complete nervous breakdown. Seven years ago. My first three children were still all very small. But then I voluntarily went into psychiatric care. And then I gradually started talking. When I think back about it now, it was a shocking and horrific system. But it makes me all the more grateful that my children, my family, my husband, are here today. And... it's lovely. Helga, did you tell Horst about the women's group we discussed last time, about what we want to do with the mothers and children? -About... -Yes, we talked about it. Sexuality. -Yes. -What do you think? I think that's very important. We grew up in this environment. With all the abuses. I think it's incredibly important. Where should we set the standards? We have children now. There will be topics that are tied to values. So we'll explain to the children that when they kiss someone for the first time, that they should do it with love. That's how we should explain it. That sexuality has to do with love. -Oh, I didn't know that. -You didn't? But how... No. That's the first time I'm hearing it. -Really? -Yes. How do you mean? No one ever told us that. And... -And that love and... What did you say? -Sexuality. Yes. That those two go hand in hand. Why are you so surprised when I say that sexuality and love go hand in hand? Because that's not the case for me, unfortunately. There is love, but the two don't go hand in hand. Because I had bad experiences too, but... And I don't know, but with me, it all... If a man touches me... Or even my own husband, I always react the same way. It's not... -I love him, don't get me wrong. -I understand. We have a great relationship. I couldn't imagine having any other man by my side. How do you feel about it? Well, I do need that we lie together sometimes. But on the other hand, if you know your partner sometimes... I don't know, finds it painful, or has no desire for it and such, then it becomes... Then there's a problem. Yes, and we have that. We basically only experienced sexuality together... Or let's say, we had intercourse to have our kids. That's all. I can take beatings. I mean... if it really comes to a coup, I can use my strength. I'm not one of those who say, "No, please don't." I'm not. But in a worst case scenario, I might show my strength. I can handle quite a beating. Even at this age. Without saying anything, it would be "Bam!" Right in my face. Sometimes I didn't know why... But why didn't anyone ever say, "Stop! That's enough"? I don't know what... Maybe... I have to talk about it at some point, because it was unjustified. There was no reason. I sometimes didn't know why I was being beaten. I didn't know. They just laid in on me. And when I hear about how that is an atrocity now. -That you'd be stoned for that. -People who abuse children? No, someone who did those things was stoned. -For abuse? -No. When men and men together... That was an abomination. It is an abomination. I didn't know at the time. I had no idea. How could I have known? Otherwise I would've... According to the Old Testament I could have been stoned. I'd be gone. But they would've been right to do so. But I didn't know what I was doing. I was in the dark. I didn't know. -Did it go on for a long time? -Yes. -What is a long time? Months? Years? -Years. Until he was gone. Ruthless... You can do it with women. You are allowed to. If she wants to. If she wants to. You have to get consent. But not just "Come with me" and then... without... Sometimes... Just "Come with me" and... Also in the office... I was just taken to the office, and the door would be locked. And we would start. I never thought that was... How are you supposed to know? And I went along with it. I went to him for that and went along with it. And how we went at it... Like animals. Worse. Today... I say I... I don't know how God will forgive me. It makes me sad, yes. Did it fall down? It's back on there now. Yes... It was one of the most difficult... moments for me in my life, I would say. This change, this new realisation and admission. "I behaved badly. I did things that were beyond comprehension." And that... I'd go somewhere on my own, into a field, and... thought about it and... then I realised it. The punishments too. These brutal punishments I'd taken part in, too. And how we punished each other. We thought it was... healthy, that it would help us to become better... and so... But now these things have been overcome and we've forgiven each other. -Yes. -Personally. We really brought things out into the open and no grudges remain. We've gotten over it now. I've gotten over it. But unfortunately what keeps happening is that people come here and want to know and hear about our past, and so what's actually been forgiven and forgotten is dredged up again and again. I don't like that really. Because my intention was... What's forgiven is forgotten. It's... It's over. Now it's about looking forward, to see what I can do with my life. Yes. Horst, most people here say that what's past is past. But can you forget what happened so easily? I mean, you beat each other up countless times, for example. Yes. What are we to do? There were some incredible beatings. It's not that we were beaten up by Sch?fer when we misbehaved. Always someone was picked from the group and then it was, "This scoundrel, this scoundrel... Give it to him until he can't crawl anymore. The horror..." But nobody was told what he had done. It was always something imaginary that was terrible. Something we were not allowed to talk or know about as children. That's how the beatings occurred. I'm sorry that I was capable of participating. But I... I spoke about how I was. You can only feel remorse as an adult later and realise that... That's all. It's... You feel remorse, but it's... It's just the way it is. I actually enjoy singing. But should I cover this up by singing? That's why I no longer sing. I never want to join the choir here again. I don't want to. And they say, "We should forget it and stop talking about the past." No. Not me. I can't stand this pathetic charade anymore. I just can't. It's an outrage. Okay, Helga. Bye then. I'm off. Yes. And take a break before things go crazy again here. Bye now. I still have to feed the rabbits. Bye, Horst. I used to have dreams about what I wanted to do with my life, but... -There's no point. -What sort of dreams? Like having my own home at least, a decent one. And a piece of land around it that you can call your own. But that... How? Not even this is our own. And I don't know if it ever will be. We don't have anything in the outside world. Not even a cabin. Unfortunately that's true, and because I have a very different opinion to the others, I am isolated and have been left out. I have to live with that. I've switched off totally. I gave in to my own thing. I completely threw myself into a work obsession. And torture myself. My wife really suffers because of that, but I... I don't know how else to deal with it. Yes... Like this, or shall I go back further? What a beautiful valley. Like I said, you'll probably be one of the main characters in this documentary. I don't have a problem with that. I am one of the more rational ones. I'm probably one of the ones who went through the most but one of the happiest. That I am still so cheerful and make fun with everyone and can laugh about what happened. People say, "With such beautiful nature, one should be able to forget about what was once so bad here." People who come here want their peace and quiet. They don't want discos, or... Sure, some karaoke at night, but they want to enjoy nature and peace. Those who don't want that go somewhere else. Yes. Hello, how are you? Hot? -Good evening. -Here's your pisco sour. Thank you. Enjoy. Cheers. Salud. For example the song, Brother, good night... I feel such a heavy weight when I hear these songs. Or, Good night, sleep well until the day... Hearing these songs... It's a horror. How come there has been no real dialogue about what happened back here? And it's always this "Forgive and forget". Well, when Sch?fer was gone, the Hierarchs agreed that... As things here were falling apart, people started talking. They were afraid we'd go to court and name them, that their actions could have consequences, so they organised a forgiveness ceremony. And then they wrote a statement with an apology in it, and read it out loud. "This is hereby buried, and we ask for you to never talk about this again." This apology was just a strategy to ensure they were not persecuted, that it would not go public, that there would be no court case. I've never reported anyone to this day. Nothing. -What are you doing? -We're just chatting. -There's a narrow... -Is that a camera? -Yes, I'm filming. -Yes, we're filming. Is that you, Acki? -Everything's fine, yes. -Doesn't seem like it. Nothing is fine. You better leave. We'll come and visit you soon. We just want to finish this. -You haven't visited us for ages. -You used to visit more often. Right. -I used to, a long time ago. -A long time ago, yes. I think we should move away from here. It's better. We can continue talking over there. The people who, let's say, abused us back then, many of them are my patients today. And I've talked to many of them. Not all of them, because some of them are very old now. And many are no longer with us. During the conversations, I came to the realisation that most of them really did these things with the belief that they needed to educate us, and put us on the right path, and they didn't realise it was actually child abuse. And yet I must say that our parents, as bad as it was, were deeply religious. They were very religious. And I don't want to reject that. They regret the mistakes they made. Who am I to bear a grudge? Not only towards my parents, but the others too. I'm not a judge. How are you feeling today? Well... Normal. Good. She sometimes plays the harmonica. Shall we play the harmonica again? Do you still have it? -Yes. -Look. Play something. Let's see if you're still able to. Give it a go. Germany, Germany Above all Above all in the world! And then repeat. Good! That was lovely. You should do that a bit every day. You can see the graves there. It's cordoned off, as the police are investigating to see whether any people were buried here during the time of Pinochet and the dictatorship. Apparently they're looking for the victims, or those who lost their relatives are looking for the places where their relatives were chucked away, so to speak. Look. It looks as if they took out a coffin here or something. It looks like that was a spot. Look. Looks like they found something. Sch?fer couldn't have done it on his own. It wasn't just Sch?fer. There were people who collaborated. Fly agarics! What did you say? -This hole... -Should we film? There are mushrooms here. Looks like fly agarics. Those are... Don't you want to film them? Let's do it like this. That'll do. If it comes off, it's not the end of the world. I saw these red heads and then I went up and took a look. That's a nice one. And there's a bigger one there and then these... I saw that one from down below and that's why I came up... There's another mushroom. You can't eat them though, can you? -They'll kill you. -Then I better not. Right. Here's the potato cellar. I wanted to show you this. I had to sleep up there. And the prisoners were tied up down here and tortured. -Yes. -Imprisoned Chileans. And I'd hear this terrible screaming every night. This screaming. Terrible sounds of beating and screaming. I knew what was going on down here. And then suddenly the screaming stopped, and I knew the person was dead. "Now he's dead." I never talked about it. In 2004 or 2005, I spoke about it for the first time. About what I heard as a child. Do you know what I was told? "Don't you say a word about it! Never talk about it!" That's what I was told. So I stayed quiet and didn't have the courage to speak. These people who were around at that time... all these men. None of them has ever said a word about it to this day. It's always locked. Always. Look, they're peeping through the windows. Look. They're holding a phone and looking through the curtains. That's how they're spying on us. Through the curtains. On their mobile phones, to inform the authorities. -Yes. -It's continuing. It's continuing. They're looking through the curtains. They lifted the curtains and saw me looking. Then they quickly dropped them again. Look at that. That's how it is here. -That's how it is here. -Yes. Oh dear, oh dear... They always say they know nothing. I guess it just happened by itself. Probably no one did anything in the end. -Bloody liars. -That's something I can't comprehend. If you're holding up a Bible, then live according to it, and don't... act sinfully and horribly but hold up the Bible. It's the best protection. A miracle will have to happen if they're ever going to realise. They don't believe in anything. They never believed Sch?fer abused the children. Oh well... Yes? Don't forget the singing. Are you coming by today? Yes. Sure. We didn't know. And those who did know, only knew they were our enemies. It was like war basically. But no one sees it like that. -But... -Bad things happened. I heard that later, that a lot of bad things happened. Things that shouldn't have happened did. But we only heard about that later, and I'm just sorry that they did those things. You just hear "Pinochet the dictator"... He was such a sweet man. The people were... I don't know to what extent Pinochet was aware of how the individual generals were treating the people. To what extent, but otherwise he really took care of the country. We were told he never took a big salary. He was paid a normal, low salary. And he got the country back on its feet again, created jobs. People cheered him on and voted for him again. And then it came from abroad, they tried to assassinate him. And they didn't manage to. He himself said, "As long as God wants me to govern this country, I will be here." Although... I don't know to what extent... You don't hear about that when things happen, but you have to see the big picture. What they really intended to do, and... if they got rid of those people, I cannot criticise it, if it... Things would've been much worse the other way round. Thousands of people would have been killed in that case, probably. Here... Here. I wanted to ask you... This part is a bit strange. It's a bit dark downstairs. They punished us in this cellar. When we did something bad, simple things... What child doesn't misbehave? And what did Paul Sch?fer do? He took us straight into his bed. But that's the past, and we have a new life. But we have to live with this history. Now we can... We are hungry now, right? Oh, we still have an hour. Ladies and gentlemen, without further introduction, the new generations and those with the most experience together on one stage. Give it up for the big family of Villa Baviera! A warm applause! Well, basically... We no longer had an Oktoberfest, or no beer festival, because... What? Oh. Because human rights activists complained that we would have celebrations here. But I say that's the biggest nonsense I've heard. What happened in Santiago at the stadium? Here... We know it's more because they want to annoy us. We hate living small We want to be young and free We are setting off on a happy journey Tourism has helped us financially. We have a positive balance. The results are positive. But tourism also helps us a lot politically. In that people can get an impression of the place themselves. There's a difference between hearing about a "sect", or a closed community through media reports only, or... if the same interested person comes here and takes a look at the place with their own eyes. It's a huge difference. Right. -What are you going to do? -We'll tell the man a lot. Who will I stay with? Let's sit down here. I'm always straight about this. Human rights organisations... They should also accept the rights of the others. We want those same rights. And I'd like to be clear about this. When people talk about "victims" here, or... Yes, about victims. Then we who were born into this or those who came here as children are the biggest victims. When it comes to Villa Baviera. And people complain about the tourism here, that we have tourism here, and that we do tourism on the graves of those who were killed, or died under Pinochet's government. That's all a lie. -Hello. -Hi. Are you filming all the nice wheelchairs? -Yes... -It's interesting too. Yes. The things that I like remembering are the good things. I don't want to miss them, and it gave me a lot in life. Also the way we were raised. With order, discipline and cleanliness. With hard work and honesty. To tell the truth, which sets you free. And that's basically the best thing you can imagine. One says, "The truth will set you free." We experienced that. We belong together like a big family. We belong together. That's how it is. Everyone thinks about the others, and cares about the others. It's a warm community. And if someone is not happy about something, we talk about it. That's just how it is, you see? And many people don't understand that. Nothing is left hanging between us. Everything is always resolved, cleansed. And we're one mind and one soul. God be with you Until we reunite When the clouds gather We will be with you Through it all God be with you Until we reunite Reunite Reunite We will one day stand before God's throne A tourist once said to me, "You don't realise what paradise you have here." And that's really true. Sleep, my little prince, fall asleep The sheep and the birdies rest, The garden and the meadow get quiet, Not even a little be buzzes anymore Little moon, with a silverly glow Look in through the window Sleep by the silvery glow, Sleep, my little prince, fall asleep Subtitles: Leah Corper Dansk Video Tekst
