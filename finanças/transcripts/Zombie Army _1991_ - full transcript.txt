[low feedback] [drums] * [ominous music] * [youthful chattering] Good morning class. All: Good morning doctor. Doctor: Okay, let's begin. In any serious study of fixation, psychiatrists must find a way to understand the puzzle of the idiot savant. Doctor Miller and I theorize that the idiot savant develops as a result of fixation and regression. In other words, as a patient fixes on one interest all other thoughts are shoved out of the patient's mind. Sort of like studying for finals or thinking of sex. [students laughing] Many famous and infamous men and women of history showed these patterns of fixation and regression. In the asylum these patterns indicate the idiot savant syndrome. But on the street, these people are just plain weird. [laughter] In our case history for today is a perfect example of a fixation that has not responded to drugs or electroconvulsive therapy. Doctor: Jim is a 21 year old white male. Jim murdered his younger sister when he was 13. At first they thought her death was an accident... but Jim's violent outbursts continued until he was finally committed at the age of 14. Jim quickly settled down... and appeared to become quite normal. He started talking and became Dr. Miller's most outstanding success story. There however was a problem. Jim was like a chameleon. He absorbed the calm patient manner of Dr. Miller. Fixated with psychiatry, he was released at the age of 16. They thought he was a nice teenager. He raped, murdered and mutilated his mother. He raped murdered mutilated his first girlfriend. With nothing more than kitchen utensils and his father's hand tools, Jim performed three perfect lobotomies. Jim had observed the operation once in this very asylum. Jim is still here and he's still quite insane. Although Jim is stark raving mad, he's able to adjust the electric shock machine for his own treatment. He has learned to control his most violent of rages... and he directs his violent behavior toward toys. Jim and Dr. Miller have co-authored papers for scientific journals on the promise of focused microwaves and ultrasound in the treatment of the tragic horror of the fixated behavior. For Dr. Miller and I both believe that Freud's fixation and regression cycle is the primary cause of most insanity. Thank you very much class. [applause] Dr. Miller: Thank you Jim. You can go now. No! I don't want to go! You can't make me go! No! No! No! No! [screaming] Aaaaahhhh! [exhales] Take him to the electric shock room. I'll be there when he wakes up. [pained crying] [knocking] [sniffling] My dolly's broken. I can fix it. Orderly, something's burning. Come with me. [moaning] [grunting] Nurse Krieger! In here. Sick motherfucker! What are you doing? Taking her temperature? Take these two to rehab! [shouting] [anguished screams] My dolly! My dolly! You can stay down there until you calm down. [laughing] They sure got you that time. Orderly: Screw you. [crying] My dolly. This way my dolly. --I won't let them hurt you. --My dolly. Doc Miller. Boys, I need your help. The words just come down from the administration. They're going to be closing this place down. We have to move all the patients to the new facilities in the mountains. Come on. [creaking] *[Music] Just like I said sir, an ideal place to put your brigade. Why you could put a battalion in each one of these buildings. And look at the training area sir. Not bad Major. Its nice to see there are some things you can't screw up. What's the condition of the buildings like? Pretty good sir. They were mothballed when they turn the nuts out onto the street. - Major: Let's go inside. - Yes sir. I only have the key to this one building but we can get all over the site through the underground tunnels. Gentlemen. [hissing] No sir, that's just steam in the heating lines. Take a right sir. Well yes sir, it is a handyman special but I think we can fix it up okay. Boy this damn place is built like a maze. It was built that way so nuts couldn't find their way out. Are you hungry? How can you tell a baby's crazy? [voice recorder in bear] How can you tell a baby's crazy? Kill mommy! Kill mommy! [voice recorder in bear] Kill mommy! Kill mommy! The saw is family [laughing] Let's go. Get outta here. Look at this. An inflatable party dinosaur. This is really sick. May the force be with you! [laughing] This is unreal. I wonder why they shut this place down. Someone figured it was cheaper having psychos sleeping outside on city heating grates then it was in nice warm asylums. I think I read about that somewhere. Actually there was a federal investigation on patient abuse here. No wonder this place is so damn spooky. Let's not talk about that shit. We don't want to freak out the troops. I wonder who rented this pad anyway. Looks like Charlie Manson to me. Hey, listen to this. "I want a warm fuzzy to have and hold I want a warm fuzzy to keep me warm I want a warm fuzzy of my own." Soldier: A warm fuzzy? This is some sick shit. Check this one out. Man this place gives me the creeps. The general wants to get the Hell out of here. On our way sir. --Let's get out of here. --Alright. Major, how soon can we have this site? It's yours as soon as I get the word sir. Captain, how soon can we occupy it? I can have an advance detachment here in the morning sir. Let's do it. "Let's do it." Gary Gilmore's last words. Was he that Calvary guy they sing about? No asshole, that was Gary Owens. Gary Gilmore said, "Let's do it," before they fried him in prison. Let's go. [marching cadence] [call cadence] Alright men. Take ten, expect five. Get to. Smoke'm if you got'em. I'mma go get the L-T.

There's a lot of ground here. There's gotta be somewhere we can hide a few plants. Man they'd put you in Leavenworth for that. Heh, or the asshole of the Earth. Take a look around my friend, that's where we are. Fort Asshole of the Earth. Man this place is worse than Jersey. Hey, I wonder what they used to use this place for anyway. Used to be some kind of fucking nuthouse or something. Keep people like Freddy and Jason. I bet they pumped a lot of good drugs into those crazy people. I bet you're right. I wonder where they kept'em. I wonder if they got any left. --Let's go find out. --You got it my man. Hey man check it out. This doors open. Prop the shit open. I don't wanna get stuck in here. This place is spooky. No kidding my man. Gimme your light man. Gimme your flashlight. There we go. Hey, gotta keep plugged in man. Check it out. I'm a fucking general now.

Here's some vitamins. Hey man let's check this thing. The fallout shelter let's open it up. Right there, a crowbar. Oh man, it stinks in there! [retching] Will you look at this shit? It looks like some kind of aborted fetus. [gasping for air] That ain't no abortion. That's a fucking dead rat man. Oh man it stinks in here. We got drug bottles. Shit, they're all empties man, these are no good. Ugh, I gotta get out of here before I puke again. Let's get outta here before sergeant misses us. [coughing] [sniffing] Smell! Smell! What smell? Fresh air! The door is open! The door is open! --My dolly! --My dolly! --The door is open! --My dolly! Fresh air! [grunting & growling] [sniffing] Soldiers: One, two, three, four! [military cadence] [gunshot] Who fired that shot goddammit! Hey man. The Hell you doing Bellman? Its only me. Hey, check it out, its only me. Hey look, we're in a fucking graveyard man. This isn't cool. Hey check it out, so we are. What do we got here? Eileen. A girl's buried here man. 1900 to 1918. She's 18 years old. She's old enough for you. Yeah, look at the date.

You're gonna have to find a whole lot more beer for her to like you. Bartender: I think these guys are about to get a little too rowdy for this place. I want yous outta here. Can we get six more to go? One more six-pack and that's it. You're outta here. Sounds good to me. Here's your six-pack. Let's get outta here. Bartender: Don't ever come back. Soldier: Ok, we'll be back tomorrow. Man! Perfectly good Saturday night shot to Hell. Yeah, they got a nuclear power plant here they got an insane asylum, and they kick us out of a bar. Sergeant Vespa, what an asshole. "Take the night off." What the Hell do you do in a hick town like this anyway? Alright man, what's on the late show? Some zombie movie. Oh man. I don't wanna see no stupid zombie movie. If you don't want to watch some stupid zombie movie, what do you want to do? Know what I'll do? I'll tell you what I want to do. I want to get stoned. That's what. But, we ain't got no shit. Ya know we've been so busy training we never did look for the mother load of drugs. Ya know you're right man. You've got your flashlight with you?

[strained grunting] This is the right plug! The machine. His head. [excited growling] Yeah! [snarling] Therapy! Therapy! Get back. I have it marked. The bigger the head... the higher the voltage. [electric buzzing] Jump start! A little more... [intense breathing] Yeah! Jump start! [electric buzzing] [mechanical thumping] Live! Live! Yes! Live! Live! He's alive! The other patient. The other patient. I will reset. Yes! You want guts? I want guts! [retching] Guts. Grrr... rawrr. Put'em in. Where are the others? They're getting more patients. More patients. Sir, I don't know where they are. When Smith and Quinn didn't show up Sergeant Sutton took the rest of his squad looking for them. When they didn't come back, Sergeant Vespa took second squad looking for them. Damnnit, I can't go to the Captain with this. Get another man from platoon headquarters. We'll start searching the next empty building, from the top and work our way down. Sir, what do you suppose happened to them? Hell if I know. Get my driver and tell him to bring that sword of his. Yes sir. [body shuddering] JIM: Yes! He lives! Up! Up! Up! He lives! [zombie growling] More patients. More patients! JIM: Help me. Another patient. Okay. [growling] Fall in. Awaiting orders sir.

Somebody or something has turned them into monsters! Monsters? What kinda monsters? Zombies? Pfft. Sir! Men in the hallway moving in this direction. [growling] Let us out! Let us go!

[growling in agreement] Take them to the treatment room! Look Carl I need solidiers. Not your badass bimbos or whatever you call them. Lethal ladies captain. It's an experiment. You won't give them a chance just because you've got a dick and they don't. Let me tell you captain, my soldiers are every bit as good as yours and they can get a dick any day of the week. Now I'm sorry Coloniel but, what makes you think your soldiers are ready for action? They were gonna drop us into Panama to kick some ass. Instead they assigned us to this ammunition dump. And you Lieutenant, what's your problem? Sir, my men sir. Sir, there's intruders in the compound. They killed Sergeant Vespa and part of his platoon sir. Damnnit Lieutenant, pull yourself together. Sir, you have to believe me sir. There's partly burned and wounded soldiers in the compound. They're not human sir. Alright lieutenant, how many of your men are gone? Including Sergeant Vespa sir, 18. Jesus the other units have already moved to the training area. They report 26 missing and that's a total of 44. Sir as God as my witness I watched them rip apart Sergeant Vespa. Sir! They ate Worrington. We're in some real bad shit. I say we get the fuck outta here. At ease goddamnnit. Since the Lethal Ladies are itching for action, I'll have them move as the point element in the tunnel. Alert the other platoons and have them search and destroy each floor above. We'll fan out through each building and clear the site. That's more like it. I'll tell Major Wainwright you got a problem here. Red alert! This is not a drill. Enemy within the compound. Prepare for combat. Move goddamnnit! Now! * [surf rock guitar] * [slide guitar] * I've got my Lethal Ladies * Now don'tcha stand at ease * The compound is in danger from attack of the zombieeees * Run and get your rifles * Run and get the gun * Your 50 cal machine gun * Yeah we're gonna have some fuuuuun * Zombies are a comin' * Creeping in the night * So come on Lethal Ladies * You've got to lead me to your fire fiiiiiight * Stay now Lethal Ladies * Won't you stay the night? * Don't go there Lethal Ladies Wait! I hear footsteps. No Heartbeat. No breathing. There's no heat source. No aura. * Lethal Ladies are so sexy * When they open fire * So come on Lethal Ladies * I'm just burning with desiiire * Stay now Lethal Ladies * Won't you stay the night? * Stay now Lethal Ladies * Won't you stay the night? * Don't go there Lethal Ladies * Um... Lieutenant... You want to check this out. Check this out, files. Holy shit. Here L-T, here's one with your last name. Funny funny. I can't believe the shit they got in here. These are what kinda drugs they gave'm. Where you headed? I'm stationed out at the old asylum. You one of the guys that works out there, aye? Yeah, we've only been there for a couple of weeks I was out on a pass to deal with a Dear John letter. Did you work it out? Nah, she's in love with some college boy. That's okay, lots of girls like soldier boys. I haven't met any around here that do. You have now. My name is Sheila My name's Kevin. I knew some spooky stories about that place make your skin crawl. Try me. They used to torture the patients. Nah. They did. Killed an 11-year-old boy. Doctor gave him strychnine. It took three days but, it finally died. That's rough, killing a little kid. Honest, that's what they did. You ever been in the tunnels under the asylum? Naw they keep us pretty busy out training in the woods. I'll have to show you sometime. Oh, now isn't it dark and spooky down there? Its okay, really. I've been in there lots of times. The power comes straight from the nuke plant. So most of the lights are on all the time. The lights are on? All the time. I'd love to see that. I'd love to show you. Well, uh, let's go. Tour begins here. I think I'm ready to see these points of interest. Time to see some more points of interest. *[hokey accordian muysic] *[crunching guitars] *Why won't you stand next to me? *Pretending you're not so a-lo-o-one. *Don't you know that I can see *You're jumping at your own shad-dow *I don't scratch and I don't bite *But you are acting like you think I might *You treat me like a monsterrrrr *A monsteeeeeeeer *What is it you see in me *That makes you run away-ay-ay *Is it my type of attitude *Did I forget to shay-ay-ave *I don't have fins, or fangs or spots *But you act like I haven't had my shots *You treat me like a monsterrrrr *A monsteeeeeeeer RAWWWWR *[wicked guitar solo] *You treat meee *What's that in your pocket book *A spray can full of may-aye-ace *Don't you point that thing at me *i don't plan to SUCK YOUR FACE *I don't drool and I don't spit *Well now that you mention it SOLDIER: Fire! [machine gun fire] *You treat me like a monsterrrrr *You treat me *Like a monster ** We have a real problem here. I'm not sure what is happening but we've already lost at least a dozen men to some kind of-- No sir! No sir! Yes sir! General we can't get our shit together without help. Sir, you had better get your fat ass down here to see what is happening. If these find a way out of the asylum that won't be all, there will be Hell to pay. [dial tone] [screaming] [gunshots] Look sir, the second one from the top says missing. Look at this. There's two files in here. Jim. Idiot savant. Nicknamed doc. My kinda guy. Guess he liked to play doctor. What's this one say? Mary. Nymphomaniac. Man here's one for you. You can read on her. Listen, what the hell's that? I don't know. Let me check. Holy shit! Quick! Get these back to the general. Rawr! Aaaaahhhh! Get you womaaan! Arrrggg! Arrggg! Gaaah! Aaahhh! Look soldier boy. Here's one of your buddies. Looks like he's been wounded. How do you know I wouldn't just want to keep you here as my pet? How do you know I wouldn't just want to just stay here and be your pet? Well, I could be one of the left over crazies still hiding out here. Crazy? Maybe. But, ugh... for leftovers, you look good enoughto eat. You're so nasty. Look, here's another one. Why look in here. They left a bed. Into the room and off with your pants soldier boy. We're in there! We're in there! You men okay? Those monsters, they killed the rest of my platoon. Same thing happened upstairs. Where's Captain Murphy? They got his ass. I saw what was left of him. Shit. Who's the ranking N-C-O here? You're the Sarge. Alright. Lieutenant Kent is dead. We found these in a file drawer marked missing when the asylum closed. We can't hold out here much longer. I just say we get the fuck out of here man. These two inmates disappeaed just before they closed this place down. It says here this Jim guy used to burn toy soldiers. I don't know. Maybe this Jim guy is still here and he's brainwashing them, or God knows what. I think the girls helping him. We have to find a way to destroy these zombies. I got away by throwing some drain cleaner on one. This is some bad shit. I say we bug out of here. No! This ends here. This ends now. You can't kill something that's already dead. No shit. Do you have any suggestions? Sergeant, I say we burn the place down. Brilliant. Not only will it not confirm that we killed them we're gonna destroy the only evidence we have that'll save our asses. Besides, how are we gonna control a fire with this? What kind of drain cleaner did you use sergeant? I don't know. Something strong. Probably acid. That's it. We can melt them to Hell with battery acid! Montgomery. Tucker. Come with me to the motor pool. We're gonna fill this up with battery acid and use a compressor to pump them up. Give us 15 minutes. Any questions? No sir. --No sir. Let's go. Hey, where's your battery acid? Just wait a minute. Can't you see I'm the only one here today? Battery acid! Now! It's over by the shed. But be careful, that stuff will melt the meat off your bones. That's exactly what we want! [moaning] [bed squeaking] Let these fuckers have it! [zombies screaming] Look! That bastard's still moving! Fry'em! It worked! It melted a shitload of them on the way over here. Drop your weapons, pods and vests, and let's go get'em. Come on out you sons of bitches! Oh my God, it's Kim! Nail her. Move out. Jesus. Die you motherfuckers! Get some! Do you hear something in the hall? Oh God! Oh I hear bells! No! [rifle shots] We got'em! How do you know it was them? Who the Hell else would be here? It was them. Let's get the Hell outta here. [retching] Sir, this shit makes the My Lai Massacre look like a salad bar. Sir, Bravo Company first battalion 66 infantry await your orders. Stand at ease. Smoke'em if you care to. We have a choice to make. Number one... we can tell the truth about what happened here... and we'll end up being locked up in a place like this... or two... we can bury this incident. We can't resurrect the dead... but we could pretend that it never happened. We can write those soldiers off in a training accident. As a result of this action all of you could be transferred to Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. There is a need for lifeguards and recreational instructors for the Wakiki Army Recreation Area. What do you suggest we do? Hawaii! Semper fi sir. --Who-wah! Well general, what do you think of your new training area? You know over that hill there's a lake big enough to swim your M tracks. Well fine Major, we can put a marine division in here but, what kind of shape are the buildings in? Well not bad sir. This whole facility was mothballed in the early 80s. Tthe army took it over in '89. They weren't here very long. The whole unit was relocated to Hawaii. General Lewis wouldn't let anyone near this place until he died. We got it from the Army for a steal.
