Welcome to my district There's no burned cars here But a smoothly running system And I'm here to fuck it all In my district money is king If you're lost, it shows you the way From the pigs to the scum Everybody want his share Here, everybody is where he belongs Here, each man is a pimp The government packs all races in here Chinese, Arabs, Gypsies, outcasts The slightest spark And the district is ready to explode Money goes from hand to hand Life is a gamble If you don't have the right cards Then for you, it's the street or the jail A guy comes to empty his balls in the district The girls, in cash, are paid But as soon as the money gets in their bag It ends in the pimp pockets If a girl doesn't bring enough, They replace her If a customer doesn't pay, they fuck him up When the girls are good They double the bets at dogs fights And for the police to shut its eyes They grease them with a bundle or two Mafia and Police are accomplices For the control of the Vice Empire Money goes from hand to hand Life is a gamble If you don't have the right cards Then for you, it's the street or the jail You can't imagine what money gives you Girls, cops, politicians Because in our district, and anywhere else they have a bar code as a heart Don't count on them to share the power They take the dough But leave you in the street DISTRICT This is a pipe, a masterpiece even! What, you dirty pig? The family is broke and you, you're having a bang!? A bang? More like six! Listen you old goat! Tell the kid to calm down, or else... - Why? - It's just an advice! It's none of my business, tenderfoot. I used to hate your father too. That's how things are, aren't they? You'll see, it gets better with age. I'm not talking about your son, Lori. My guys will gut him if they catch him before me. Which one then? None of my other sons is emancipated. I'm talking about Lori's son! Richie, your grand-son! If you touch one of his hair, I'll go to jail and you to the hospital! I won't hurt you old man, you already have one foot in the grave! But tell him to leave my daughter alone, or else! Myn Richie, with Julia? He's not so desperate! Calm down a little, what would I become without your small pension? May your house be 7 floors high, without elevator, without stairs, And Saint Guy invite you for a danse! Fucking shit! Of course, you already saw the balcony scene in many films. It inspired several romantic writers. In Verona, we can still see, even nowdays, the balcony of the scene... Who would climb to the 5th floor for a chick dressed like the one in the film? They didn't do that in Rambo... Stop telling me what you've seen on TV. Take that to Julia instead. To Julia! I said "to Julia"! 500 with the shirt, and 530 the James Bond outfit... The final scene, when the two lovers are embracing each other under the moonlight is one of the most tragic scene. What did you think about it? Allah is great and Mohammed is his prophet! Very well, anybody else maybe? It's beautiful how they're lying, next to each other! You're retarded, they're dead! Maybe but it's still beautiful! You'll be lying in your grave, next to your family, will it be beautiful!? Girls, calm down, it's not the break yet... Still a minute left to try to reach the truth of the work: Romeo and Juliette touches moral truths that not only existed during Shakespeare's time... hot air... ...or even in your friends life. Don't forget that love is eternal. If you unite, you can get anything in life! I'm being fucked by the machine! I can't believe it... one-eyed whore! Go Fiorentina! Go Fiorentina! Old man, it's Ukraine-Hungary. In 67, Ukrainians were nothing, fuck off! - We're in 2004, old man. - Yeah. Help me, noble Sires! Nine Romanian minors stole my wallet and I must buy my train ticket... No lies! Why don't you tell me: "I'm an alcoholic and I must get drunk". It's less romantic, isn't it? Cut the crap, you think you can fool the landlord? Well, you're lucky that I'm in a good mood... Give him a drink! And now fuck off! Thanks boss! Hey, look what they're doing! District calling, the 28 is set. Hello! What the hell is this? That, my boy, is the monitoring system 28. Hey! This thing will watch my street all day long? - All day long. - What about business then? There are rules, you must obey. Send your virgins somewhere else! It's none of my business, they're not my girls... But officers, it won't be safe for anyone. And you're monitoring everywhere? Every street! I hope it won't prevent us from doing some business together. We can always find an agreement... Alright? But now, get lost! Hey rats, what kind of business are you doing on my square? This is my territory, isn't it girls? May the pox plague your family, may your mother taken away from you! I'm gonna blow your brain out, motherfucker! Your daughter will be an orphan! We'll bury your son with you if we see him one more time hanging around my Julia! Believe me, that's how the ghetto is Everybody is a star of the ghetto What are you doing here?! Fuck, you seem pissed off! And your color! You're going to the solarium? We can go together. I invite you, I can afford it, you know! The pikeys don't go to the solarium. Forget my sister, or else. Don't look for trouble! What disaster, filthy? I'll make a disaster if you don't shut the fuck up! What, Snow White? Your father is just a piece of shit! But yours too, nigger! Fuck off you dirty plague of a peasant or I'll shoot you! If you want to fight, we'll fight With lyrics, not with baseball bats Your fists don't have the power of words Listen, I'll give you a demo - I'm a Gypsy and proud to be - Be careful! I'm a gypsy, I want to be respected Be careful! I'm the hostile style man, with a skilled pen When you're showing off, I erase you With rhymes, not with a mace You're gonna get some With free-style, not with headbuts I'll throw you out of the District, with haiku, not with high kicks Come closer with your gang I'll penalize you, drown you under my flow It's the rout, a pikey acting like a nigger Don't run away, if you're a man Here, all the ways lead to the Roms You've got nothing to do in the District You're just a pathetic fink You're a pikey, so what? Nothing to be proud of You're a gang of go-getter thieves I'll have you lick the whole District Hear the message and burn in hell! Hey kiddo! Hurry or your father will kill us! I can't believe it, his father is paying the cops to be his chauffeur! Forget him peasant, he's had it. You still haven't bought your licence? Don't forget, we'll meet again! Loser! You can be sure of it... You're already retired, my good lady? Yeah, early retirement. You know, our work is very hard. We get tired fast. A little pension bonus would be welcome, wouldn't it? Because then we'll comlement the District pensioners... We can talk about it, gentlemen, while having a drink. There are men and women. It has always been like that and it'll always be like that, as long as we'll live. Blood is being shed, the flag is raised and man's brain is fucking off. A woman is everything to a man. But the woman only wants money. Man needs money first, then comes the woman, like a fly on the meat. And if there's a woman, there's happiness. That's how it works. So, the woman needs money, the man gives her the money. This way, he gets the woman. Money, money once more, then the woman. Yeah, in this order. Dough, dough, chick. It's the rule of life. If we have the dough, we have everything. What about love? No stupid questions! A man doesn't talk about it. Go see Rose, she knows about those things. What things come from and why. Rose. Opened out rose. Velvet and honey. The miracle of nature. Gift of God. Flower of love. Exhilaration and slavery. You smell it and you get dizzy. You can't escape. You're in love, you're doomed. It's dark. And the rose is here. The opened out rose. God knows. Love is coming. You look, turn round, nothing. You turn round, it's here. It happened to me a couple times. But the devil was watching me and Rose too, with the broom stick. Love is also only sex. Sex is the main thing. So, repeat it. Dough, dough, sex. In this order! Thanks for the help, uncle! I love Julia and I'm sure she loves me too. Richard Lakatos and Julia Csorba. Madam Richard Lakatos. Spouse Lakatos. My dad-in-law is a stupid cunt. My father hates my dad-in-law, the asshole. My father-in-law feels the same about my father. The Lakatos and the Csorbas hate each other. It's really like in this whining greaseball story. And we are the heroes! But me, I don't wanna die! And for me not to die as well as Julia, we shut the whole world up. So they'd stop making noise. Dough and sex! Dough, peace and sex! Dough and peace... and love. For love, it's okay. But for the dough... we must find something! Hi! If I have money, I'll be bigger My name will shine and the problems will vanish! You can get the moon when you're loaded Bread, dough. That's what I need, lolly! - Do you want to feel my sport bag? - Real kids! Don't kill this poor guy! Can I have his snack then? That's enough, you amateurs! You're annoying! We need more cash, less waffle! Without dough, we'll die right here. Talk for you. Me, I'll be rich. Yeah right. You'll wear secondhand clothes. You'll have just enough to buy 4 robes and a moped. And a one-roomed flatlet here, in this stinking district. Sick fuck! I'll make a solo record. And I'll have lot of boys. All rich. I'll be on TV wearing furcoats, you loser! Hey! What is it? Show me! An oil well, like grandfather used to have! Yeah but he had the oil to go with it! It would be great... Fuck, we'd be rich. I'd buy the Parliament, no, the National Circus! We'd go with the chicks. What is oil made of? Toto, I'm asking you. Oil is made from the remains of dead animals and vegetables, fossils and minerals. It's the raw material of gazoline, it's the most important and most precious mineral of our civilization. Can't we make some? If we go back a few billion years in time and we stock a few million animals. It seemed so simple. Why does it require so much time? Let's kill a goat, put some stones over it, wait a little and we'll have some oil! Well, bye! I gotta go! Give me a holler and you'll be rich! What now? Let's go to Kolompar to watch the porn channel! Listen, this cash story ain't so stupid. Let's find some oil and we'll be rich! We'll fill the pockets of our fathers, they'll barely be able to walk. They'll be happy and we'll be together... forever! Yeah, yeah, I can't wait. But I have to tell you that it doesn't seem very credible. Well, you know what? If it works, I'll help you with the accounting... okay? It'll work, I'm telling you! Well, then, I'll walk the dog back home. Sharko! So, let's have a closer look. Toto, if you accept the idea of a friendship between ethnic groups and if you want to live, then find an idea! Dear Richie, intelligence doesn't stand violence. Besides, I have an idea I could work on tonight. Damn nice! So, mister the scientist, get back home asap, and come back tomorrow with the solution! What are you waiting for, Toto? Go get some oil, so we can be rich! I'll get a day off at school tomorrow for everybody. We'll skip the 2 first classes and meet at the Sex Shop. Mandatory attendance. Yes, a few more adjustments and it'll be good... Life is beautiful! We can see the whole city. Pigeons droppings, whores... I love it. But what's going on here? We're at 7 places at the same time! What's that? Fucking camel saddles merchant! Someone stole our camera! Do something! Look! - Listen, push this one... - Not this one! - What about this one? - It's a disaster. - It's fucked... - It's your fault! Wait, I'm thinking! Hurry, it's spitting the tapes! What a mess! I'm a policeman because I can think! You put your dirty hands everywhere! What? What hands? It reminds me when I wake up after the match! We'll call a specialist to fix this mess. Hello, 2245 calling, we need a list of the register. That's right, order of our superior... You're saying he's on vacation? Of course he's on vacation, that's why we're the ones calling and not him! We need the list of all the hackers caught during the last 2 years. A bomb will explode at school today and blow everybody up to pieces! Don't be ridiculous, you're so stupid... But Gunther! Did you forget that we used to bath at night? My God, it's horrible... Did you already come here? Us? Never! Not today at least! Who called them? It's me, but him, nobody called him. I'm telling you that without me, Julia isn't going anywhere, okay? Alright. What should we know, Toto? Let's see. The existence of the fourth dimension is accepted by many scientists. The main thing was to create a carrying wave including the photo-propagation process and Schrodinger principle, to travel in time. Cool! So, we have oil? Abdul said he'd bring something for the explosion. A guy who lives under my father's shop has a bomb. Don't say a word to the adults! It stays between us. I once heard my father mention that oil had to be turned golden... He also said not to listen to what he was talking about! There's a lot of hair-lightening stuff in my mother's hairdressing salon! Hide the gear behind the school tonight! Nobody must see us with all this shit, understood? From now on, we're a team. Come on, let's go now. Hey kiddo, you must pay for the used papers! Move, there's nothing to see! Order cancelled! We found all the bombs. Please, spread out! I'm staff sergeant Badar, and here's the very brave platoon leader Vizy! The both of us are fully in control of the situation. Omar, do you have a mother's day too? My mother what? I asked you if you're celebrating the Mother's Day in your religion. I'm coming for the bomb. But don't you need one? It's fine, I'll buy another. Let's see... multi-recidivist, computer piracy, it's at least 2 years. Two years for destroying Budapest's radar system, and three years away from any computer. Without mentioning drugs consumption... We were trained to tie you to heaters and to beat you up, not to fix computer networks. From now on, you cooperate or we send you back to jail, understood? Do you really want to start a home and family at 60 years old? We have an agreement, you fix this mess and you watch over the business. If you see some dough, you call us. No need to disturb us for thefts and muggings. Work well! But be careful, we're watching you! Fuck! So this is all ours? Look at all this stuff! We can see everything! we'll be the eye of God! You want to make some cash with this console? Is it Chen who sold it to you or what? I never saw that, look! - Be careful. - Can I touch? Give it to him fast if it smokes. On ne touche pas, on ne parle pas, tout le monde fait attention. Hurry, before the singing class ends! Stop talking, Toto! Show us! It'll give us some oil. It can go back in time. It can also open the garage door, it can be used as a camera but also a ventilator and a juice extractor! Stop! Is it a time machine? Juice extractor? Why aren't you in singing class? We got caught! You're so pretty today... We're revising physics. To help Kolompar who might be held back a year... So, we forgot to sing. Do you really think I'm stupid? Toto, show me what's in your hands. Right now, yes! Guys, we must try! - It's true. - Yes, we should... My god, what did you do? He sacked the homeroom teacher! Who's that? It's the right place but not the right time. - Did you see her tits!? - Bring her back, Toto! The only thing that matters is that she's alive! We can only teleport one biological entity at a time in space-time. Couldn't you talk like everybody else? We must hold our hands together! I'm holding Maria's! In your dreams! Bastards! Make a circle! So... let's say... may the light... be! It's good! Damn, damn... the band went too far. Let's bring it back a little to Adam! - Where the hell are we? - What's that? All I can say is it's not the Sahara! It's probably Tibet. So many hovels... I'm scared! Nice town! Are we there yet? What do you mean "yet"? You mean "again"! We're here for the oil, the petrol! Where are the animals? We'll go right now. Let's have a drink first, alright? It's uncle Gus incarnated! And the other Kolompar, the old cunt! Do you like my fake Rollex? I thought it was a real one! What are you looking for, children? HElp us, good aunt, we need mammoths. Hey, what is it? The bone is here. Where's the bone? Can you help us? I can ask the cops to lead them here. He screwed me... I can't believe it... He did that to me, the fucking wog. It was my favorite fake watch! Stop it, you know we'll be rich soon! Richie said it. Don't piss me off! Fuck this gypsy and you too. What is he up to again? Do you want to do it? Family first! Do you understand what she's saying, Maria? Of course, don't you? She's talking in old gypsy. Well, attention everybody! It's time for the briefing. Some local cops will bring the mammoths. Girls at the shampoo, Sandokan at the slaughter, Chen will play knucklebones. Abdoul, take the bomb. The mammoths are coming soon. Get ready. Simon, watch for the cops, as usual. It'll be a pleasure for them to help us, Rose told them that we were divine descendants. Belus, I beg you, don't do anything! I'll supervise with Toto. No quesions? No? Good. Get to work! I knew he would make us work! Where are the mammoths? Come here, it's hotter here than in an oven! Three, two, one... No injuries? Everybody is alive. She offers a real mushrooms goulash. Mushrooms goulash!? Please, tell her that I'm allergic to all mushrooms, okay? Rose, I hope we'll meet again! I'm sure we will... Did, did she... really say that in Hungarian? Dunno... I think there was something in the mushrooms... Wake up! Belus again... he brought a chemical product. I already saw something like that. They'll get better soon! Won't thet? This... damn... biochemistry... It's oil! How can it be? The District has been built over oil! A miracle... I'm asking these two young men to tell what is this shit and this oil smell. It's just school homework. The teacher said that if we brought back samples from earth upper layers, we would get a good mark. But this hole is at least thirty meters deep! But there's two of us, we want two good marks. We don't accept the answer. Kolompar and Simon, show your ID. Thank you. If you continue like that, there's no doubt you'll go to the university. Fuck! Faggots! Tell me, does he have a good expression? He speaks better than me. He also has a program of commercial terms in English, Japanese, Arabic and Chinese. You're telling me that with such a nice tanned face he doesn't speak gypsy? Fix it. Who knows, we might have to deal with gypsies! Agent HU317 reported some activity at 38 Nemeth street. Some minor thugs involved in some oil business. Given the international situation, the timing ain't a coincidence. I'll keep watching the young men and I'll keep you informed of their acts. Irinka, are you there? HU317 logout. Right now! Why did you lock the door? I'm coming! Wasn't it Elvis? It was madam the deputy, but she lost some weight. Young men, young girls, if you agree... we can start the next lesson. Please go to your classroom. In the name of all the school staff, I wish a nice school year! The young man doesn't like art? I do but I finished my work at home. I leave it to the school. There's not enough room at home. Thank you, thank you. May I serve something to our young man? Maye some ice coffee? Uncle Pista, leave us alone. Can't you see we're working? This boy is mean! It's just that people count better with a full belly. And for the miss? No thanks, I don't want anything! We have four trade talks going thanks to the robot. If they knew the oil were ours they would flatten us with a bulldozer. And people say that youngsters are inflexible in the District... I always said they were good kids. The lil' one could even become a policeman. Any news of your son? I have a real father-son relationship with Dany. I even found my money in his pockets. Isn't it cute? - What? - His name is Bela. Your son, I mean. Hello. I'd like an orange juice, please. Don't tell me that it's a diamond ring!? It's as plain as the nose on your face! It's worth at least 200000, isn't it? Where does it come from? Where did you get that? - It's a present. - And from who? Richie. Show me! It's gonna turn out badly! The Lakatos bastard? Come with me! Julia got a diamond ring! And do you know from who? From Lakatos! Does Lakatos have a diamond mine in South Africa? A diamond big as a watermelon... It's worth at least 100 million, It's obvious! His father had a heart attack when he saw it! Dear Prime Minister, it is very urgent... Forget me! We're hunting! Yes? Let's go... I nursed a viper in my bosom. Listen to me instead of watching reality shows on tv. You didn't say anything even to your mother who brought you to this world! You wouldn't even spit your own saliva! I never imagined we would get to that. It wouldn't have happened if you had been brighter. We just wanted to earn a little money, really... Yeah, but it's never too early to start, isn't it? I'd buy you a drink if you were older. - No thanks. - Fine. Is it Richard Lakatos who gave you that!? Instead of nursing the viper in my bosom, I should have put you on the street! Yes. He bought me a ring because he loves me. No, he doesn't love you! A Lakatos will never love you! I'm gonna kill him, I'm gonna suck his marrow. But firstly, where did he get so much money? I open your closet and bing! A Stallone collector dvd box set falls on my feet! Not to mention the golden night stick, and the Lorex watches. I don't even have one myself. Stop opening your mouth like a retard, son of a cunt! How did you get the money? I killed. What? You killed? You should have thought about it... Everybody is gonna be blackmailed and beaten up now. You put it in a bank I hope? No, don't even answer, I don't wanna know. Personally, I would save some money, and go to New York, London, Paris to do some shopping... Why did me make some oil? To be rich! We went back in time. We knocked out many mammoths to make petrol out of them! Then we thinned them and we came back to sell the oil and that's what is happening. What's happening? What's happening? Did you sniff the whole fucking boulevard to be raving like that? If you take me for a bloody asshole I'll give the both of you a lifting with my dumbbells You're really messing with me! I'll tear all your hair off if you see him again! I killed and hit, I split their skulls open one by one! And as blood was spilling, I licked my hand and I could feel the mammoths warm blood... Blood! And they were coming to me to be slaughtered, and I hit them hard! Harder than Rambo! I clubbed thousands of wild animals to death, I took on a whole army of mammoths bare handed! Don't be so sensitive, I just worry about my only son. Blood! Blood! ...are you sure you don't want it? 1975, matchless. Men are waiting in line on my sidewalk They're not here to go window-shopping I make them file past from the morning to the evening I do to them what their girlfriends won't Fishnet stockings, cleavage dress Shining skirts and loud strings I attract them one by one on my bed Until they melt in my mouth Their turgescent member gets in me everywhere I'm an easy girl, mother of all vices All day long, I touch, lick, stick. Why? Because I earn in one night what you earn in a month Our life isn't all pleasure Our life is hard like your desire We have to suffer our pimp's blows and your bangs For a fistful of dollars earned on the sidewalk Every week you pay me a visit As we're filling a bedridden shape Your desire becomes my bitterness My future has a taste of asphalt Our pimp is our master and money our leash We're bringing the money but we swallow the rest We never protest if we don't want to be mauled For a leather coat or a bag of dope We practice every night the hard job of a bitch You're talking about your family but I don't give a fuck I'm not your psy Shut up and act, that's all Our life isn't an outing Our life is hard like your desire We have to suffer our pimp's blows and your bangs For a fistful of dollars earned on the sidewalk Panic spread to Wall Street. According to many witnesses several suicides followed the market break-down. Over 25 employees and managers killed themselves before security could adopt emergency actions. The oil crisis has reached such a level that we fear more suicides might happen. Jessica Langley, from Wall Street, NY. But why would we need oil wells? I understand. Soon, everybody will have some except His Holyness. It's always the same thing. Fucking whore, I'll cut you open. Then tickle, tickle... I'll buy you whatever you want... Is it my fault if a boy loves me? And what if it's Richie? My dear baby, I'll tell you something you should know. I never had the opportunity before... I've been dreaming about you for a long time. I've been waiting for you I have to tell you now I love you so much, so become mine I've been dreaming about you for a long time I've been waiting for you I have to tell you now I love you so much, so become mine Tell me, what is love? What is this fire burning me? Believe me baby, it's not claptrap When I see you, I know why I live... Someone is coming. We must not be seen together! I don't care, come up. Does it bother you? No... Stay like that! Julia, let's choose a star! Look at thi one, let it be our star! - It's so beautiful... - I'll buy it for you tomorrow. No, I like it better in the sky! As you want... Richie, I have to tell you something. I'm listening my Julia! I want to say that... well... that... you and me, together, like now... Julia! We'll talk tomorrow! People must not see us together! My only treasure, Come here into my arms! You're not such a bad girl after all. It's just that you're... scatterbrained. You're afraid, aren't you? I can understand, anyway... You played a dangerous game... Rose, you have no idea. There's nothing that I don't know! I know that you tried the impossible, you built a time machine. I know that oil and money flow like water. You see, there's nothing you can teach me. And I also know that you're scared, you have too much cash and the old men are suspecting something. Don't hide! They're tracking you. Be smart, give them what they want and they'll leave you alone. Give them a few billion, they'll have something to chew on. You can always keep a percentage. Times are hard. We're being tracked. Where are my children? They're hiding because of you. No, because of you, child murderer, misfortune of your mother. Aren't you ashamed to fight with children? You, stop barking, you who hit your own daughter. A gypsy never does that, you dirty animal. You fanatics! You, the gypsy, take the hand of your white brother and come up to my home. Your children are here. You'd better make peace before opening the door... Ask Richard to calmly say what he has to say. I ask the others to accept what Richard says. And I ask everybody to get the fuck outta my kitchen when you'll be done. Alright, we're telling you. Because you're the strongest and the oldest ones. Anyway, we can't stand it anymore. We went back in time, we made some oil, now we're selling it. We give you the business if we can skip school and if you give us 30% of the receipts. - 10! - 30! 20! Alright, 20%. If there's no minimum age for the peep show. If you accept these conditions, then you can manage everything. My darlings, my gifted children! Give a kiss to daddy... Oh boss! My savior! The boss has a nice car! I hope you're having a nice day, because I... What did I say, you dirty beggar? Fuck off and steal like any honest man would! You don't belong here! If the pope wants some gazoline he must beatify Maria! At least blessed. My dear son, I ask you to be a little more understanding. Understand that it will do no good to the country and the district. Excommunication... What? I'll go there and set fire to the whole Vatican, then you can go sleep to Danko if you're breaking my balls. What did he say? They don't have enough money but they kick up a fuss. May God punish them! They have no respect. Well, next! Brother, that's a nice suit, same color as the devil! Good idea! And what about the mayor? And me, I'm Csorba and I fucked your sister. You can go count your bills to the Maldives with all the money you earned. You were supposed to sell me your district, for my girls. And now, you're coming with this... expulsion bullshit. What am I to you, a pensioner? You can burn them! Listen, come back tomorrow with the papers or I'm gonna take care of your mother. I'm the king of the world! I'm a Gypsy king, Oil king in Hungary Nobody dreamed about it and I did it! Oil is earth milk I drink it until I become a billionaire Car, house, luxury trip My desires know no rest I see, I buy I fuck girls and their mothers But don't worry, I stayed in shape If you're looking for trouble I'll break you I need bread and even more I'm the undivided ruler of the District The only rule of the district. You give me both halves! All women are mine. They want to satisfy their king! Csorba and Lakatos, the kings of oil Like vampires sucking the dark blood from the earth How you're doing love? If I knew I would installed the cameras earlier. Those computerists are good kids. No need to work, money is still flowing in! Yeah. Good kids. I hope we won't get caught, partner! There... there! Yes! So, we go out and we go in. Girls outside! Boys outside and inside! Getting out of the bath, Getting in the clothes, getting out of here, getting in the car. Come, come... This way, please. The delegation has arrived! Thank you sergeant, you may leave now. Thank you! Thank you! Don't forget your partner, sergeant. My dear friends! It's a great pleasure to be among you. The results of your production are impressive. Words fail me... We can give you the numbers if you want, it's great. We're thinking the same, but let's respect the protocol. Allow me to introduce myself since we don't know each other. As if he didn't have a file on each of us... I'm the Prime Minister. Happy to meet you at last. Lorant Lakatos, life artist. We already worked together, didn't we? Lakatos: car thief, recidivist, wants street names in gypsy language. Really? I don't remember. Excuse me. I salute you, I'm the Prime Minister. Karoly Csorba, contractor. Oil bleaching, convict. Very dangerous. He's the one who wants to buy the mayor. Nice to meet you. AS you know, unlike other governments, we offer all our help to contractors. With a specific emphasis on local interests. We're planning the creation of representative councils made of local contractors. I must confess that it's a wonderful feeling for us... just after our entry to the E.E. C... He's good in his leader role. The pleb always swallow this European waffle. Do you smell that? I'm gonna puke. Hicks and gypsies together... Which ones stink the most? Hicks? Gypsies? Guards! Arrest them! Ouch! My foot... Thank you. Hello. Tickets please! You're not bad, light-haired boy... You're boxing good too, neighbour. - Do you realize that we're in deep shit? - No shit... What can we do? Well, I don't know. I know. Let's have a drink. I'm thirsty. Then let's drink! Stop! I have a question to ask you Richie Lakatos. You became very rich... We all know that there's oil and that money is flowing in the district. My gun and I, we really must know where this oil comes from! And you're gonna tell us in the name of world peace. Of course, sir! Oil is made from the bones of dead animals from geological prehistory era. We're lucky that the District is right on top of an oil layer. We just have to dig deep enough and the oil is coming. So young and so much money! I'm the district most expensive girl and it's the third time you come this week. I'm just curious, you damn animal, where do you get all this money? And also, I never saw such a big tool, you dirty stallion! Where, where... well, from the ground. There's as much money as we want. Nice black cash, liquid. The oil belongs to Budapest District. Lot of oil under the District. Thank you. Help! Rose, in the name of world peace, we must know where this kid got his oil. We don't want to take it from them we just want the truth. We must know where the oil is! We're simply curious... Sniggering horses are coming. And saliva is squirting from their mouth. Their teeth are like rocks. With bloodshot eyes their muscles are shaking as if they were ready to explode. They're gonna crush us with their huge legs. Ooooh! The bad horses! This marc brandy ain't bad... Yeah, it's from Tolna region, just... - Like me! - Yeah... How long did you do? 4 years at Aszod, when I was a kid. After that, 2 years at Pest. - Where in Pest? - At the Kozma. It's lousy... Why? What about you? Tolnai, Gyorskocsi, Gyujto, Csillag... Seven and a half overall. That's good, that's the minimum. If I die, will you take care of the District? People say I'm a bastard but it's not true. It's the same with me. If I'm the first one to die, will you take care of my kids? May I go to hell if I don't! Me too... This kid Richie isn't so bad after all. I'd never let your Julia go downhill. She deserves better than that. They must not become like us, do you understand me? I'm a father, my dear Lori... - So, is it coming? - It's coming, brother. We're gonna buy everything... We'll create an independant country. We'll buy everything here, everything. You'll be Prime Minister, brother. So, we claim our independance from Budapest and even from Hungaria. But you know what? You can be the king. It's okay with me. We'll be rich and the whole world will marvel at us. We'll be true models for our people. Okay... We'll have everything here, lot of money and tourists, but do you know what will be the most important? I'll tell you... Iove and happiness. A new hope for all Hungarians! Don't start again! There won't be any Gypsies, Hungarians, Chinese in the District. There'll be nothing but good buddies. Lecture test Virtual reality OK. I'm asking for the background. It's not in the current events... Place OK, we're contacting the guests. President Bush. Minister of Foreign Affairs. Mr. Tony Blair. President Chirac. Prime Minister Sharon. President Putin. Mr. Blair, Please attend this meeting in correct clothes. Everything is in order. Wait... is everybody online? As you know, our agents identified the epicentre of the current oil crisis at a location they're calling: District. Our agent says that the key of the secret lies in ivory sales! According to our information, the main subject of this matter is what we call "Black liquid money"! Our special agent came back with a recording in an unknown language called gypsy which took several weeks to translate. With bloodshot eyes their muscles are shaking as if they were ready to explode. They're gonna crush us with their huge legs. Ooooh! The bad horses! Of course, The United States don't believe this fundamentalist waffle! Our agents have been deceived. I took part in many scandals, nut I've never been the victim of such a deception! Me too. That's enough! No one can take over the world with impunity! We must exterminate those terrorists immediately. There's only one way: nuclear technology! Nuclear technology! Richie, Richie! There's no more oil! Shut up! What do you mean "no more oil"? Here, have a look by yourself! Fuck, it's serious! We must warn the old man! What's going on, partner? Things aren't running too smoothly! No more oil! What? There's nothing! Just water left! You're watching CNN live. Anyway, the hell with these Hungarians, who are they and where is this District exactly? According to the head of the Congress Library, the synonyms for "Hungarian" are: pointer, tchikoch, paprika, goulash. Hungary is the nest of organized crime and porn industry. The District is at the center of hungary's capital. I understand. Let's send the nuclear warheads! The moment of truth has arrived. Everywhere in the world, all tv shows have been interrupted. The world is still reverberating from Bush decision to nuke a place called District, which acquired a bad reputation during the past few months. According to the economic press, the "black weeks" changed into "black months". What do you bet that we're gonna make it? The 68 car card? With the Lolaturbo. We always get out of trouble... We're not attacking the country, but just "an infected part of a diseased body". FREEDOM Let's hear George Bush, president of the USA. My dear American citizens! The menace that threatened the soul of our nation is no more. We put an end to the oil crisis. Europe doesn't dictate our economy anymore. Now, all citizens of the country can rest assured. We nuked Hungary's capital. Bucharest is no more! Pinch me if I dream! Kiddo, kiss your father, we're alive! We can't follow the stock exchange, our shares are losing their value. You see Maria, you can still become a singer, this is God's will! Yeah, even God! We should celebrate! Let's have a drink! You're my guests! My son, you'll have to wait a little longer for the houris. They nuked Bucharest because of us, do you understand? Richie, there's something I must tell you. So say it, Julia! Richie, you're a very nice and brave boy, and it's a good thing that you're a gypsy, but... it's just that... I think that... I prefer girls. We're alive! We're alive! Why are you looking at me like that? Do you wanna have a taste of my high heels? Don't get on your high horse! Who do you think you are? You're a nobody now that there's no more oil! What are you barking, kiddo? There's no more oil? What? There's none left? You wasted it all, gypsy!? Stop saying gypsy, you hick! Everything is back as it used to be! Thanks uncle Gus! No dough, no girl. Just this fucking district! How much did you get today? Are you sure we must sell her? Need money. May Toto die and fuck the long term investments. I can't touch my dough until I'm 18. Let's give it a proper farewell, it was dear to my heart... Farewell my Stallone DVD collection! Lori, my brother, may God bless you. Now that I spent 20 million, give me 20000. We're of the same family. Why doesn't it surprise me?
