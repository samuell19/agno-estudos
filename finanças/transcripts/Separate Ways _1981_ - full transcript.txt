[MAN TALKING INDISTINCTLY] [THUDDING] MAN 1: Come on, babe, you've got this one in the bag now. Don't make any fancy moves until you're ready. MAN 2: Okay, crank 'em up. MAN 1: Okay, stick it to 'em. [CAR ENGINE STARTS] [ENGINES REVVING] VALENTINE: Why don't you share what's going on in your business with me? KEN: Because you don't understand anything about it. That's not the point. I don't wanna be left out. I love you. I really do. Nothing? When something's bothering me, it means nothing to you. You're always talking about communicating, so talk to me, you son of a bitch. Let's talk! I loved you today, you were a different person. Like the you I used to be married to. I wanna go with Jason. Now, Macaroni, that's up to Jason if he wants to carry you. I'll stay here if you get a real dog for me to play with. Macaroni, we've been through this so many times. Jason, didn't you tell Macaroni your daddy doesn't want you to get a dog? Not a real one, till you're big enough to take care of him. [PHONE RINGING] Come on, Ken, pick up. [PHONE RINGING] [HUFFING] You better hurry up and get dressed and brush your teeth, okay? [PHONE CONTINUES RINGING] [KEN HUFFING] [SIGHS] Naturally more important than anything I'm doing. Hello. Hi, Allen, Just a sec. It's Allen for you. Okay. He'll be with you in two push-ups. Okay? [GRUNTING] Oh, very good, sweetheart. Can you do the rest yourself? Of course I can. Oh. You're damn right I was pissed, Allen. The copy, the whole concept, it sucked. In a word. Don't mind me. Well, evidently, you and that copywriter of yours, Sheila, didn't understand anything I said. My gimmick, Allen, is that I don't have a gimmick. Don't look at me that way unless you plan to do something about it. Later. Okay, Allen, uh, read it to me over the phone, why don't you? Yeah, I'll wait. Come here. Give me some lovin'. No, no, no! Yo, go ahead, Allen, yeah, shoot, shoot. KEN: Mmm-hmm. Mommy, what if one of the pigs eats me? [LAUGHS] Oh, well, I'll just tickle him and make him spit you out. Mommy, you're joking. [LAUGHS] VALENTINE: And so are you. [LAUGHS] Listen, Allen, I can't really tell over the phone, okay, uh... Oh, Mommy, what if Billy's mother doesn't know any fairy tales to tell us before we go to sleep? Hey, Jason, you're getting to be a big boy now. If Billy's mother doesn't know any fairy tales, you read her one. Now, back to those teeth. Go get yourself some breakfast, honey, it's all made. Jason's getting too old to walk in on you half dressed. Come on, I don't want him to grow up with hang-ups about his body. And he's getting too damn dependent on you too. He's independent. He's what? He's independent. He just loves me, that's all. I think it's great that's he's gonna be on his own with those kids at that farm. You're a real tiger when it comes to Jason, aren't you? One thing in my life I can be sure of. Well, that's terrific. Where does that leave me? A very close second. I'll take it. Just remember, baby, without you, nothing about my life makes any sense. That's the truth. [GRUNTS] I've been up since before dawn and I'm already... I'm already... I'm already behind schedule. Good. [LAUGHS] Don't forget my suede jacket.It's on the list. WOMAN: [OVER PA] Call on 36 for parts. Honesty. That's what I'm selling. All car salesmen say that. What's different about you? Sheila, just write me copy that doesn't sound like any other car dealer. I want to look into buying up all the spots during a specific show or movie. What... Now you're talking expensive. You're not telling me a thing. How expensive? Come on, Allen, work up some figures so we can have an intelligent conversation. And no more gimmicks, huh? No camels, no penguins, no fairies... But somehow, make an attention-getting commercial? It's an opportunity, Sheila, to do what hasn't been done on TV. What hasn't been done, you can't do on TV. [SCOFFS] Oh, by the way, Sheila, I'm not a car salesman, you see, I'm a, uh... I'm a business executive who happens to love cars and motors. So I made them my business. Yes, I believe you. [PHONE BUZZING] Yes, Huey? HUEY: Ken, I have an urgent problem. Can I see you a minute? Yeah, I'll be right there. Excuse me a minute, will you? My business manager needs me. I'll be right back. So? What'd you think of him? Charming. He's here again, that flooring man from the bank. Yeah, I know, I just saw him. Well, what the hell are we gonna do? We can't get by with this much longer. You'd better think about laying people off. Oh, no, no, no. I can't do that. No, no. Let me in on something, will you? What are we running here? A charity or a business? Your father is turning over in his grave, I know he is. He was a tight-fisted businessman. Huey, Huey, you worry too much. [SIGHS] These commercials will help, business will pick up. Come on, you'll see. Have I ever been wrong before? Have I? All right, all right, I give up. Just one thing. What do I tell this flooring guy when he comes waltzing in here asking about the missing cars and the money we owe? Will you let me worry about it? You just get on the phone and sniff around for another bank loan, okay? [SIGHS] Alex, he's a good race car driver, good mechanic too, but a business man... [CHUCKLES] No, he's not that. Paul. WOMAN: [OVER PA] Tom, you've got a call on 35. How you doin'? What are you doing, taking inventory? Yeah. Hmm. How's it going? Well, I can't locate some cars. According to the flooring sheet from the bank, we've loaned you money for more cars than I can locate on the lot. [SCOFFS] Well, that doesn't sound right, does it? They must be around here somewhere. Let me see the list. Ah... Well, here, 00460, we sold that this morning and I forget which numbers yesterday, but naturally, we haven't reimbursed the bank for those sales. [HORN HONKING] KEN: That's my wife in that one. Hi.Hi, Jack. Mrs. Colby, please don't tell Ken I authorized the loan. Why, was there a problem? That's the flooring checker from the bank. It was bad enough he showed up. On top of that, our new hotdog sales person... Mary? Mmm. Hi. Hi. Bitch. Had a buyer, only she never mentioned it. She does sell a lot of cars, but so would I with a pair of tits like that. Oh! I'm sorry, Mrs. Colby, forgive me. Listen, don't be jealous of Mary's tits. They... They wouldn't work the same on you. Huh? I'll personally check out all the missing cars and I'll get back to you. I'll be expecting your phone call. All right, first thing in the morning. Give my regards to Harry, will you? [SIREN WAILING] WOMAN: [OVER PA] Scott, you're wanted in the service department. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Hello.Hi, darling. How are you, sweetheart? Mmm. Ah, Jack, I think we better get rid of this thing here before Mary's customer comes back and sees us standing around a car we convinced him he didn't need to buy. Right away, good idea.Hmm. Don't say it. Don't say what? I shouldn't have exchanged the car when you weren't around. Well, that's funny, I thought I was gonna say I never saw you looking more beautiful. Oh. Oh, by the way, the bank manager canceled tonight. Oh, goody. Just the two of us for dinner. Oh, the bank manager canceled, so we're canceled, right? We'll see. It has been a bitch of a day. Let me just finish up in there with Allen and I'll... I'll see you in a moment, okay? Sure. VALENTINE: Woody? WOMAN: [OVER PA] Mike, you have a call on 35. Woody.WOODY: Hey, is that my funny Valentine? Oh. [CHUCKLES] Heard that enough for a lifetime? Two lifetimes. Yeah, well, it's a good thing you weren't born on Halloween. Mmm, careful, careful, careful, you'll get all greasy. How're you doing?I'm doing great, honey. Good. Hey, look at you, don't you look gorgeous. [LAUGHS] Thanks. What's all this about? Ah, I'm trying to get Ken to come in with me on building a stock car. WOODY: With Kenny doing the driving, damn it, we couldn't miss. I don't know why he won't commit. Val! My master's voice. Yeah, well, don't keep the boss waiting. [EXCLAIMS] See ya. Bye. KEN: Oh, this baby really handles. What's this about you and Woody building a car? I don't get this, Val. What is this? Fifteen minutes you're in the garage and you're into every corner of my business. I'm interested. You know, one thing I wish you wouldn't do. I wish you wouldn't pal around like that at the garage. [SCOFFS] I was palling around with one of our oldest pals. Yeah, but Woody works for me now. And I don't like my wife being used by my employees to send me messages. That's not what was happening. With Woody or with Jack. You're such a naive person. [LAUGHS] Why won't you share what goes on in your business with me? Honey, you don't understand anything about it. Well, how could I understand something about which I've been told nothing? And that's not the point. Not, not asking you about your work is like not asking you about you. I don't wanna feel left out. [SNIFFS] It smells like horse manure in here. Probably the fertilizer I was using for re-potting the plants. Mmm-hmm. And don't confuse me with my mother. You can say "shit" in front of me. Jesus, you're in a funny mood. I miss Jason already. Mmm, me too. Jesus, Val, use the electric knife. It's so silly looking. Yeah, but it works. Here, give a press.[WHIRS] [WHIRRING] [MOANS] [CONTINUES WHIRRING] [CONTINUES MOANING] [TURNS OFF] I was only kidding. Okay, honey. Something's been bothering you all evening. Now, let's get it out, hmm? I feel confused about my life, our life. Since we moved here, I don't have anybody to talk to. All my friends are back at the old neighborhood. So why don't you make some friends here? I can't talk to these women. I mean... All of them either work all day or drink all day. The house is finished, it's beautiful. Jason is in school and I don't know what I mean myself. But you don't have enough to keep you busy? Don't finish my sentences for me. I hate it. I have enough to do all day. I could fill my days with things I love doing, but it just... There's a void. Why don't you let me go back to school full time or get a job? Because I want us to have that second child we're always talking about. [WHISPERS] I know. Remember you're the one, you're the one who always said you don't want Jason growing up as an only child. I don't. I just have to be sure. I thought you said we were talking. We were. Too much. Let's make a baby tonight. Technologically impossible. It takes at least 30 days after you stop before you can conceive. Oh, good, that gives us 30 rehearsals. VALENTINE: I love you. I really do. Everybody wants you, but I got you. [KISSING] KEN: Does that feel good? VALENTINE: Yes. Let me move a little. KEN: Oh, just let me make love to you. You know, we haven't toasted Annie's homecoming yet. Her, uh... Her PhD in Anthropology. Mmm. And her practical specialty of tribal screwing and what about Micronesia? [LAUGHS] Oh, Karen, have some coffee, huh? You haven't had any yet. It's delicious. KAREN: Oh, I gave it up. I gave it up. It really makes me terribly nervous. Okay, to Annie's return. There you are. Thank you, thank you. Welcome home. Annie, tell us, is it really better if you do it when you're smoking pot? I want you to tell us all your wonderful, mind-blowing sexual experiences in Berkeley. Poor Berkeley, if all the stories you heard about were true, none of us would've had time to get a PhD degree. Besides, via the grapevine, I heard about more wild stuff going on around here. [CLICKS TONGUE] Well then, Karen and I have certainly been out of the mainstream. I mean, we've been living sedate matronly lives ever since you left. No perversions, no intrigues, no lovers. Oh, come on. Even our husbands have been relatively good boys. Oh, Val. I really love you. Just... You think because, uh, Ken still worships the ground you walk on, it's the same for everybody else. Allen loves you. I know. Yes, he does, but you know, he's having that affair with Sheila. What? His copywriter. Uh, and what can I do, I... I can't leave him with three kids. And he... He's a good father and a good provider. Um... And of course he's holding all the cards. [LAUGHS] [STAMMERS] And no relationship's perfect, now, is it? I'd go crazy. I mean, I don't know what I'd do. The other morning I woke up and I looked at Ken lying beside me and I thought, "Who's that?" I nearly screamed. You live with someone a long time and they change slowly and you don't notice it. And then one day, wham. Well, you must've changed, too. Not much. I really envy you being out on your own like that. I missed having that. I wish I'd get to love my job as much as you love yours. House wife. I won't apologize for it. It's right for me, I'm good at it. Everything I've always wanted. [SIGHS] I'd be overwhelmed keeping up with this place. Oh, and that pool table. Does Ken play? Of course he plays. Why else would he have a pool table? Oh, I didn't mean anything by it. I know what you're thinking, though. I mean, I have clothes, a big house. He just likes to have a lot of things. Val, why are you so defensive? I don't know. I mean... Are the two of you gonna get along this time around? No, Ken and I will never be a good mix. [PHONE RINGING] Okay. Hello. Oh, hello, sweetheart. Oh. No, I mean, that's all right, if it's for the commercial. Oh, I understand. Well, thanks, honey. Thanks, but I really do understand. Okay? Bye. Well, you're going out with me tonight. My date's no romantic deal. Just a lot of fun. No, not tonight. I gotta get you home so you won't be late for that date. It's beautiful down at the marina this time of day. Mmm-hmm. Why don't you stop by and see our boat? Oh, the one you told me about, The Valentine? Mmm-hmm. The Valentine. VALENTINE: I'm so glad you got a houseboat down at the marina now. God. You know, I feel like I'm deserting you. Oh, no. I'm just happy you're home, Annie. You've been missed. Oh, you too. I love you. Okay, bye-bye. Bye-bye. Thank you. I'm glad you liked the dress I made you. [SQUEALS] I love it, I love it, I love it! Bye. VALENTINE: Bye. Oh! I forgot about the cake. Especially for you, dear. Do you like it? It looks like vanilla, but it's really chocolate. [LAUGHS] Oh, my goodness, what a mess. [LAUGHS] [SHUSHING] Here, this is for you, and this is for her. [GROANS] What the hell is that? [CHUCKLES] [WATER RUNNING] What is that? Chocolate cake and confetti. What does it look like? What time did you get in last night? About 2:30. You were dead to the world. Are you sick? Oh, just a little hangover. Mmm. Oh, oh, I see. That's how my dessert ended upside down, huh? Yeah, I had a little party of my own. It seemed like a fun idea at the time. Oh. I'm sorry you went through so much trouble. When I called you, I thought you understood. So did I. Look, I know you don't feel like it, but, uh, you should have some. Here this is gonna help. Here. No, uh, later. How'd it go? Hmm? The meeting with the... Oh, what's her name, that copywriter lady? Oh, Sheila? Not so good. I don't think she's up to it. Up to what? To do the TV spots the way I want them done. You really are hungover, aren't you? Did you work at the office? No, no, no. On the boat. There were just too many interruptions. Matter of fact, I had to let Sheila go. Oh, too bad. Who's gonna replace her? Hmm, haven't decided yet. [STAMMERS] What is it? What is... What's all these questions, Val? You'll be home tonight? [SLURPS] I'm not sure. I think I'm gonna have to see the bank manager. I'll call you. Hmm. Mmm. KEN: What are you gonna do today? I'm not sure. I don't know. I'll call you. Mrs. Colby. Mrs. Colby. Oh, hi, Jerry. I thought that was you. I missed seeing you since you left the old neighborhood. Yeah. How's your new house? Well, it's nice but I miss the old neighborhood, too. It was much friendlier there. Are you still working at the old grocery store? Oh yeah, part time. What are you doing on campus? Oh, I take an art class. Couple mornings a week. You're just going on your way to class, too? Uh, no. Actually, my classes are all through for the day and I was on my way to go skating. It's the big craze now. Where are you going? To my car. You mind if I walk with you? Please do. [LAUGHS] Gosh, the only exercise I get is jogging to the kitchen. My husband is very efficient about all that. He kinda has routine exercises every morning. I don't know. Routine exercises just bore me. Well, you ought to try skating. It's a lot of fun. Maybe I ought to. Why don't you go with me right now? Why don't I? [CHUCKLES] It's a little too fast for me.JERRY: Oh. Maybe I'm a little dizzy. I'm sorry, Mrs. Colby... No, no, I love it. It's wonderful. It makes you forget everything, doesn't it? Even who you are. It's good therapy. Hey, you know that's exactly it. For me too, I mean... Sometimes I get so uptight studying. Are you sure you didn't cut any classes today, Jerry? Well, nothing important. Thought so. And like you said, skating is sort of like therapy. What are you studying to be or don't you know? Oh, I know, all right. I wanna be a vet. A vet? That's nice. Suits you. Yeah, but veterinary schools are getting harder to get into than med schools, so.. You'll make it. Why don't I buy you a gourmet hot dog? I don't eat this junk. It's real poison. Hey, Val, uh, I got a lot of good food at my place. It's real near here. All right. [SAXOPHONE PLAYING] How's that? Very nice. I gotta leave much as I'd like to stay. Oh, man, I wish you hadn't said that. It took most of my courage just to try for the first kiss. I don't think I got much left to mount a second attempt. I should've stopped it sooner. I could see us heading for that all afternoon. But why? Why should you have stopped it? Okay, you're married, happily married, but making love is beautiful and who would we be hurting? [LAUGHS] It worked in a movie I saw once. Yeah, it's worked in lot of movies I've seen. My son has one like this. You talk about famous lines from movies. Well, I hope you're not gonna say you're old enough to be my mother. Because you're not. You have a wonderful aliveness about you. Very electric, honest. But one night with me isn't gonna solve anything. No, don't. [SIGHS] Oh, look, Val, I'm sorry, okay? I... Don't apologize, we've had a lovely, lovely afternoon together. Let's just leave it at that. Bye. Hello, I'm Ken Colby. I'm a business executive, and I just happen to love cars and motors. And I'd love to serve you. And cut! Excellent, print this one. Clear out. Good. Was that good? Excellent, excellent. Thank you, thank you very much. Thanks a lot. Wonderful. Listen, there's food and there's champagne. Help yourselves, fellows. Thank you very much. Ken, that was sensational. I had no idea you were such a good actor. Well, thank you, but will it sell cars? Hey, that was great. WOMAN: Great, Ken. Thank you, Mary, Jack. Okay. Sumbitch is back and look who's with him now. I tell you, I don't like it. Huey, just, uh, check on the other banks, will you? Huey, everything's gonna be all right. Yeah. [HUMMING] [KNOCKING] Don't creep up on me like that. I didn't. You just couldn't hear me over the shower. Where have you been? I tried to call you all afternoon. I took a customer out to dinner and I wanted you to join us. Is that where you've been? Yes. [CHUCKLES SLIGHTLY] And before you start complaining, I called you from Canlis to let you know. I did. I called you twice. Any news of our son? He called from Billy's. I'm gonna pick him up tomorrow. Do you, do you think I could get a few more details like, uh... Did he miss us, uh... Not very much. I don't think. I think we're gonna hear about that farm for weeks, maybe months. Ah, eureka! A smile! A little one, but it was there. I'm sorry about last night. It's just to remind you I wanted to be with you. So many. Honey... What do I have to do to be forgiven around here? Or is it something else that I've done? Hey, Jerry. Hi, Val. I was just on my way home and thought I might stop and go skating and thought you might, uh... Well, you know what a great time we had. Yeah, we did, but I'm rushing to meet my son. I'm gonna pick him up. He's staying at a farm with some friends. Oh. Hey, let me carry that. Oh, no. I'm fine. Afraid I might take a peek? [LAUGHS] Val, uh, there's something I wanted you to know. Oh, man, is this hard to say. Well, here goes. [EXHALES] What you said the other day, about having one evening with you... Uh-huh. Well, it would be enough. I mean, I don't have any illusions about a going affair with you. Well, that's good, but if it's just for one evening, what's the point? [SIGHS] Yeah, sure. You're probably right. And, listen, don't be afraid, okay? I mean, I'm not gonna bother you or come to your classes, but if you change your mind and you wanna see me, you know where to find me. Don't I get a kiss goodbye? You're late. Come on, honey, don't be mad at me. The other evening when the bank manager had to cancel our dinner date, you were taking me along. In fact, you insisted I had to go. That was the other evening. Mmm-hmm. Then you rescheduled and now, suddenly you don't want me. Suddenly I'm not included. No, no, no, the other evening was just gonna be public relations, but tonight, it's business. Something's come up. I bet it has. What does that mean? Anything you want it to mean. Honey, if it wasn't business, I'd take you with me. You better go. All right, that's it. That's all I'm gonna put up with. What the hell! What, are you afraid of me now? Is that it? Well, Ken, I mean, I certainly wouldn't want to spoil your whole evening with your bank manager. God knows I might say the wrong thing and just ruin the whole evening for you. Honey, it is very important that I make a good impression. [CHUCKLES] You're telling me. That's the trouble. You're more interested in impressions than what's real, what's important. [SIGHS] Look, I haven't got time for this bullshit. I'm... I've gotta go. You know, when you wanna talk, it's called communicating, when I wanna talk, it's called bullshit![GROANS] Come on, tiger, I mean, I've never seen you so worked up over nothing. Right. When something's bothering me, it means nothing to you. Ken, we've gotta talk about what's going wrong in our relationship. Listen, as far as I am concerned, nothing is wrong with our relationship. I am a perfectly happy man. But if you feel you've got some complaints, now is not the time. Funny, it never is. I am leaving now. Then go. [DOOR CLOSES] Oh, I almost forgot. Uh, Woody and Darlene want us to come over Sunday for a barbeque. MAN: Give me that barbecue sauce. Honey, you're gonna get grease on that meat. Ah, best marinate in the world, axle grease. Oh, yeah? Yeah, that's why they call it a pit barbeque. [BOTH GROAN] Boo. [BOTH LAUGH] I don't care what he says, that barbeque sauce tastes terrific. It's terrific, isn't it? Ah, damn it, Ken, it's fun to be working on the cars again. Ain't it swell. Ain't it swell. Ever since your dad died last year, and you took over the business and became a hot-shit executive, we can't even pry you out of the showroom. Hey, watch your language, watch your language.Hey! Dar don't mind. You ought to hear some of the words she taught me. Oh. Uh-huh.Among other things. Well, Val minds. Hey, speak for yourself. Well, if somebody minds, it must be me. Oh. [LAUGHS] Hey. Do you want me to remind you of some of the words that used to come out of your mouth when you and I were both mechanics working for your dad? All right, get your ass in gear and let's try this mother. Yay! Yay! Are you ready? WOODY: Ready. Give me the reva. [ENGINE STARTS] Bitchin', it is bitchin', ain't that grand? Oh, boy, hear that? [LAUGHS] WOODY: Get us a couple of beers, will you, honey? DARLENE: Okay. Hey, what I'd like to do, is start out on a modified stock car circuit and then work our way up to the formula stuff. Yeah, I've got all the papers. I've kept track of every cent we've spent so far and we've projected costs, I mean, the whole schmear. Yeah, it'd be dynamite publicity for you. [SIGHS] You guys ain't pressuring me, are you? Hey, babe, remember when you used to drive race cars for somebody else and win? Now, you'd be driving for us.Mmm. Hell, even a guy that's never gonna buy anything zippier than a sub-compact likes to think that his car dealer is a big time race car driver. [DARLENE CHUCKLES] The competition will be eating dirt. Come on, pal, what do you say? Yes. Well, you do good work. I's interested. [DARLENE LAUGHS] Hey! How about dinner? We've got steaks and... Steaks? They're gonna burn. Yes. I know. [GROANS] Oh, man. I thought I was in shape. Oh, am I sore. [MOANS] How's that? Better? [MOANS] Wonderful. Wonderful. I loved you today. Don't you love me every day? Yes. But I loved you more today. I loved watching you work with your hands. You really are interested in his idea, aren't you? Come on, honey, you're putting this thing all out of proportion. This is just a business possibility that I'm considering. It'd be nice though. Like the old days. Kinda like you the way you used to be, you know? I'm not the way I used to be. Nothing's the way it used to be. Come on, cut that out, will you? Val? Come on in. I was just studying but not concentrating. Excuse the mess. Would you like something to drink? If I knew you were coming, I would've got something special. [SIGHS] What made you change your mind? I kept thinking about you and how you said we didn't have to have a full-blown affair. I get the feeling you've changed your mind. Oh, no way. I just don't know how to start. The old Lansing honesty. I don't know why you brought the champagne, I told you I wanted a serious talk. All the more reason for champagne. We'll drive up to lookout point, we'll, uh, watch the sunset, and then we'll talk. [SIGHS] Ken, please, I don't wanna do that. Can't we stop? I wanna talk now! And stop treating me like I'm a child. That's terrific... That is... That's really terrific. KEN: Damn! What are you doing? [TIRES SCREECHING] KEN: You said you were in a hurry. So I'm going faster and this better be important. Just left the showroom full of people. VALENTINE: Will you stop? Will you just stop? Pull over, damn you. Don't you tell me how to drive. [SCREAMING] You wanted to scare me, didn't you? Even if you had to kill me! KEN: Stop it. You're hysterical. I saw you with Sheila. I saw you screwing her on our boat. Is that what this is all about? Sheila was nothing. We were working late, it was just one of those things that happened. I mean, it's over and done with. I never cheated on you before. I swear, I never cheated on you before. I haven't been faithful either. Not faithful, what does that mean? I just made love with somebody and it scared the hell out of me because it meant something. I enjoyed it. It was free and spontaneous, the way you used to be. [GLASS SHATTERING] Get in. You're always talking about communicating, so, talk to me, you son of a bitch. Let's talk! Not now. When? I don't know, I gotta get back to the lot. Back to the lot? Ken, I'm warning you, I will not be tabled or put on hold any longer. Either, we talk about this right now, or I won't be home when you are ready. You know how I feel about threats. Well, I mean it. [CAR STARTS] And I mean it. So, Ken's coming home to an empty house and a note, is that it? Well, I didn't plan it that way. Didn't have much choice. This is Annie's number. Please don't give it to Ken. All right. Uh, I'll call him tomorrow. And how long are we supposed to keep up this fiction to Jason, about you and Ken being away on a business trip? Well, just for a few days till the weekend then I'll have a chance to talk to Ken and we'll make some more definite plans. [STAMMERING] You know, I don't understand this. Is this or is it not a separation? I don't know. That's why I don't want to tell Jason yet. Darling, running away, you know, it doesn't solve anything. Well, staying there isn't solving anything either. I mean, we don't communicate. Look, I'm not asking for your approval, but I do need your understanding and support. DORIS: Well, you know your father's retired. I didn't mean that kind of support. I don't expect money from anyone. I'll... I'll manage on my own. Well, I don't know how. Fine. Thank you for letting Jason stay here. I better go say goodbye to him. JASON: This used to be my mother's room when she was my age. Are you asleep? Almost. Honey pot. We want to know how long you and Daddy will be gone. Just a week or so. I'll call you every day. Promise? I promise. I gotta go now, honey. I want you to help Grandma and Grandpa as much as you can. I will. And be a good boy. I want a kiss too. Oh, okay, Macaroni. Mother? Yes, honey? I love you. I love you, too. ANNIE: There's scads of girl Friday jobs. Entry-level jobs don't pay enough to support a family. Well, what about administrative assistant? Annie, you've gotta remember, I went straight from my parents' house to Ken's house. That's true. [SIGHS] But you at least had two years of college. That should qualify you for something other than waitressing. I'm not sure it qualifies me for waitressing. Listen to this, "Some experience required, some experience necessary, "experienced waitress only." Oh, here's something, "Cocktail waitress, "experience desirable but not required, "good looks and good figure a must." Must is underlined. Well, you certainly qualify for that. Thanks. But it does sound a little... Flakey? Yeah. I'll just keep it as a last resort. Val? Do you think you should rush into looking for a job? I hate to admit this, you know, even to myself, but one of the reasons it took me so long to confront Ken was I was afraid. Of what? I'm so damn dependent on him financially. Here, have a fortune cookie. They're so much fun. Best part of the meal! Uh... "Your energy and persuasive abilities are high, "but you divide yourself among too many trivial tasks." True. No, it's not. It is true. "One moment of anger can destroy a thousand moments of happiness." Oh, I don't like that one. What ever happened to all those nice ones about "You're about to receive a large legacy." Have another. I ordered some extra cookies because I knew we'd need some extra luck. [CHUCKLES] Dangerous game. "Someone close to you is thinking about you." ANNIE: You're kidding. [PHONE RINGS] Nah. No, no. Confucius on the contrary. My phone is unlisted, it cannot be him. Hello? Annie? I know Val is there, so don't bother with any numbers. Wait. Should I say no? I have to face him some time, don't I? Hi, honey. Hiya, baby. I'm practically there. VALENTINE: What? I'm at a phone near the marina. Ken, I left you a note. KEN: Yeah, I read your note, sweetheart. Okay, you made your point. I... I acted like a louse this afternoon. That was a pretty heavy number you laid on me. I laid on you? What about what you did to me? Look, we could pick up Jason at your parents' and we'll tell him the trip was canceled. No, we can't! I don't want Jason upset by this. Val, you don't have to go through with this. I understand what you were trying to say, you won, okay? Let's not beat it into the ground. What did I win? KEN: What are you trying to prove, huh? What are you gonna do at Annie's? Get a job for one thing. [CHUCKLES] Who's gonna hire you? What the hell kind of a job do you think you'll be able to get? Gee, thanks for the vote of confidence. [SIGHS] VALENTINE: Any job, nothing fancy. I need some time to myself, but I'll be in touch and I'll call Jason every day. Val.[HANGS UP] Val? Hi! God, I don't know when I've been so tired. Oh, Val, don't be discouraged. I mean, you know, chances of finding a job your first time out, they're almost... I got a job. ANNIE: You're kidding. Oh, Val, that's fantastic. Oh, which one? The last resort. It turned out to be legitimate. Off the wall, but legitimate. Well, tell me about it. Okay. [CHUCKLES] I think that says it all. Tits or crotch, sweetie, take your pick, but you're going to show something. They're cut that way. I guess you're right. This thing tickles like crazy. Oh, well, that we can fix. [CLEARS THROAT] I'm Sue. Hi. Val. And thanks. Oh, you'll be just fine. JIM: Hello. SUE: Oh, Val meet Jim, our bookworm and everybody's favorite. It's nice to meet you. How do you do? He'll keep an eye out for you too. JIM: We'll see you out on the floor. SUE: Okay, great. She's nice. Well, most of the people that work here are. You're the... Well, Barney likes to call me security, but actually, I'm the bouncer. Did you ever work in a place that had a bouncer before? I've never been in a place that had a bouncer before. Well, don't let it scare you. It's pretty tame, actually. JIM: You ready to go? Now, remember, Val, there should be no grabbing. I mean, looking is all right if they're polite, but you're a waitress and they got no rights over you, except to expect good, polite service. That's all. Now, once the show starts, that's a very delicate time, drinks-wise. See, for some of the audience, well, the girls, the dancing, it stimulates their alcohol buds, for the others, they forget even to breathe. So, don't push any drinks during the show, but, uh, keep your eye peeled, just in case, you know. Okay. I got a good feeling you'll get a hang of it, huh? Got a good instinct. I'll be in my office if you need me, all right? So, go to work. MAN: Oh, yeah. [PEOPLE LAUGHING] Yeah. Hmm, hmm, hmm. [LAUGHING] Can you help me? May I take your order, please? Ah, let me see, Cutty and water. Yeah, that's good for me. Yeah. Okay. MAN: Let me help. [LAUGHS] MAN 1: 7 and 7. MAN 2: How come this fat guy gets a 7 and 7? [LAUGHS] I tell you, I should have a beer. No, no, you take my drink, okay, Carmine? I'll have both. Can you give me two beers? Okay, two beers then. Yeah, right. But, you don't want one though? Don't make no mistakes. [RAUCOUS LAUGHTER] Um, a 7 and 7 and um... Okay, Cutty water here. Oh, I'm sorry. 7 and 7. [CLEARS THROAT] Two beers please. BARMAN: Right. There you go. Thanks. MAN: Whoa! MAN 1: Here she comes, here she comes. Yeah, well, get ready. [ALL LAUGHING] Hey, what took you so long, honey? Yeah, where you been? [LAUGHING] No, that's his. No, that's my 7 and 7, that's for me. MAN: Yeah, thanks. MAN 1: No, that's mine. VALENTINE: Here's your Cutty water here. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CROWD CHEERS AND CLAPS] [RAUCOUS LAUGHTER] Hey, don't go away, come back.Whoo. [MUSIC PLAYING] Congratulations, it's your break time. That is unless, of course, you wanna watch some more. I've never seen anything like it. Oh, now, wait a minute, wait a minute, don't tell me that turns you on. Maybe a little bit. But it might be all the fantasies buzzing around the room. You know, you are a very open lady. I like that. So, I'm gonna ask you a question. What's your wedding ring all about? About being married and having a son. Oh, I knew I shouldn't have asked. How does that fit in with your working here? Not real well. Do you suppose that your situation is too big a problem for me to get interested in you? Yeah. I, I couldn't handle that right now. Okay. [MUSIC STOPS] [CROWD CHEERING] [FOGHORN BLOWING] Damn. Annie, what are you doing here? Did you sleep over, honey? [CHUCKLING] No, silly, you slept over. This is my place. Oh. I guess I was dreaming I was home. Well, how's the Foxy Lady? Well, I survived. [LAUGHS] For a while I didn't think I was going to. I got, uh, $48 in tips. [GASPS] 8:45? Oh, damn. I was gonna call Jason this morning and now Daddy and he'll be gone. Well, uh, I, I don't wanna lay anything on you, but Ken called. He brought Jason home last night. He hired a housekeeper until you come back. Where did he tell him I was? Damn. Well, you're gonna have to know. He told Jason you're in the hospital. What? Is he crazy?Oh, just for a check-up and a rest. Oh, well, I guess I should be glad he didn't give me anything terminal. At least I can show up at home without divine intervention. Bastard! Hospital? Well, what's it gonna be? No, this Sunday's too soon, but this race the Sunday after next could work. Are you kidding? No, I ain't kidding. Hey, man, that's great. That's great. No, don't touch me, you dirty person. Ah! Is the car gonna be ready? Shit, what do you think? I think, I think. All right, we're in business, eh? It's about time. Ken, your wife on the phone. Oh, tell her I'll be right there. Well, get to work, will you? Get to work. Hey, I wanna show you what I did to those carburetors. What? It was your idea and it worked. Ah. Get to work, you dirty people. Get to work, you lousy people. KEN: What do I pay you for? Don't give me that "Hiya, sweetheart" routine. I'm so angry about Jason. What are you angry about? I wanted him home with me. Thought it was just ridiculous for him to be at your parents' house. But a hospital? Come on, he must be so confused. Well, listen, we're all a little bit confused. Why don't you come home, and we'll try to untangle it? You know why you did it? Can I tell you? Because you knew if you had Jason home, you could use him to pressure me. You think I'd do that? I mean, you're questioning my love for my son now? Ken, I'm not gonna be pressured into running home into your protective arms. [SIGHS] I want us to work it out, but I need some time to get some perspective. Okay, okay, I'm not gonna pressure you anymore. Listen, I'm trying to sell The Valentine, is that okay with you? Fine. Why? Well, you were right, I, uh, I got into buying things I didn't need. [KNOCKING] Ah, you'll get your share. Well, money's never been a problem for us, I mean, you've always been overly generous. How's, uh, business or is that still a topic we don't talk about? KEN: Business is good. Yeah, really, really good. Uh, listen, Val, there's somebody here, so uh, if you need me, you know where to find me, okay? Bye. Bye, sweetheart. Harry, how's the head honcho? I'm sorry, Ken. I have to protect the bank's position. Harry, you're canceling my loan in just two weeks. You can't do that. How am I gonna get some new financing in two weeks? You're gonna put me out of business. My hands are tied. Committee at the bank made the decision. Harry, you're a friend of mine, now can't you do something? This gas shortage has hurt everybody's business. Nobody's buying anything. Look, I'm sorry, Ken, lots of businesses are going bankrupt these days. Anyway, the bank expects all the money you owe us in two weeks or we'll just have to pick up the inventory. Go ahead, cancel it. I'll get a loan from another bank at much better terms. I did you guys a favor by giving you my business when everybody else in town wanted it. I'm late for my next appointment. Huey, drop everything and get in here, will ya? Uh, Mr. Brooks, please. Yes, I'll wait. Listen, it's urgent... [GROANS] Mr. Brooks, uh, Ken Colby from the auto place. Uh, I was just wondering if, uh, your bank is ready to extend us that loan? KEN: Well, you see, we're dissatisfied with our bank and we... Okay. Yeah, right, I'll check back with you in a month. Thanks. The sons of bitches! Two weeks? After all the money they made on us? When things were good, they were begging us for business. Wining us and dining us. Now we got a little trouble, huh, they won't even take my calls. May I take your order? Oh, yes, I'd like a beer please. Okay. Uh, can you take the order now? Yes. A beer. You can? A beer. A beer. All right. Thanks. And you? Uh, two straws. I'm sorry... I'll have a couple straws. [STAMMERING] Do... Do you want anything to drink? No, just one beer and two straws. All right. [MAN WHOOPING] And that's two beers here? Yeah, get the straws. Cute, eh? In honor of your first paycheck and your first week, and may there be many, many, many more. Thanks, Barney. Oh, thank you, Val. MAN: Ah, come on! [THUNDER CRASHING] VALENTINE: I saw a dog that reminded me of Macaroni today. JASON: How did you see a dog at the hospital, Mommy? There are no dogs there. That's right, darling, there's no dogs here. I saw it out the window. JASON: Mommy, when are you coming home?Soon, darling. Do you love me? Yes, I do. And Macaroni too? Yes, I love Macaroni too. Daddy too? Yes, and Daddy. Let me talk to Daddy. Go on upstairs. Come on! Go on. Hi. Val? Ken, I'm coming home this weekend, I can't stand this anymore. I've gotta see Jason. KEN: Well, that's okay with me. Do you wanna tell him we're separated? No. VALENTINE: I mean, unless we are for real. Well, Val, it's going on two weeks since I've seen you, it's beginning to feel like a pretty real separation to me. You don't sound like you care very much. Ken?Val, I care. Do you? What do you mean? I call Jason every single night. I know you miss Jason. I don't know if you've even noticed my absence from your life. I noticed. Val, do you want me to ask you to come home again? Does your vanity need that? You fucker. [CHUCKLES] Hey, that's quite a mouth you've developed there, lady. Well, me and my mouth, you take one, you get the other. It's a package deal. You want us both back? You say the word and I'll be at Annie's before you can finish. [SIGHS] No, I'll... I'll come home under my own steam, if I decide to do that. Sure, sure. Uh, Woody and me are running the car on Sunday. I'm gonna be driving. It would mean a heck of a lot to me if you'd be there. But that's all the pressure I'm going to apply. The rest is up to you. Goodbye, honey face. Bye. I don't like your outside fur. I bet you have much nicer fur underneath. MAN: How does your fur feel? Hey, hey, come on over here where all the action is. Come on. Hey, forget about all that. Come on, forget all that fur feeling, let's do some fur seeing. [ALL CHATTERING EXCITEDLY] Can I tell you what I think about all this? Can I just tell you what's so pathetic about all this? None of you care at all about me or my body, the only real hots you've got is for each other. ALL: Oh!Boy... [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [ALL WHOOPING] [SINGING INDISTINCTLY] Yeah, baby! ♪ The bigger they come The harder they fall ♪ ALL: [CHANTING] Go, go, go, go... [ALL WHISTLING] It's a disaster. Yeah, I'm afraid it's getting a little out of hand, Barney. [ALL SCREAMING AND CHEERING] I'll show you something. You get out of here. That's enough of you. Do you wanna fire me now before I quit? Quit? Val, I was gonna give you a raise. The way you put those drunken bums back in their place, and they loved it. Listen, I run a very classy joint. Well, Barney, I've had it with the Foxy Lady. Oh, come on, Val, surely you can stay on just, just till Friday. Okay. Ah, good. [CAR ENGINES REVVING] God damn it, Kenny, why didn't you tell me? Darlene and I'd have hocked everything we owned to help you out. I appreciate that, Woody. I'm just sorry I disappointed everybody, that's it. Oh, bullshit. You can't blame yourself. You wanna get that? You got everything? Yeah, of what's left, yeah. Sorry, Ken. Take care of yourself, Jack. I'll see you, Huey. HUEY: Hang in there, pal. I'll call you. [REVVING ENGINE] Right. Ken's been good to all of us. I wish we could do something to help him out. So do I, Jack. So do I.Yeah. Okay, you throw it back to me, okay? Here I come. [EXCLAIMING] Oh, nab, nab. All right, your turn. KEN: Get ready now 'cause I'm gonna pass. [LAUGHING AND GRUNTING] KEN: Make a pass, make a pass. Mommy, Mommy. Look, Daddy, it's Mommy in a funny car. Mommy, are you all better? Much better. Please, Mommy, don't get sick anymore. I don't want you to go away ever again. Jason, I wasn't sick. We just didn't know what to tell you. Your dad and I are having some problems, but we're working them out. But I love you and I missed you so much. Where'd you get that limo? Bought and paid for with my own money. You wanna do some yourself? Do you want me to fix you something to eat? I didn't know you could cook. I'm learning, I'm learning. KEN: Am I invited? VALENTINE: Well, this is wet work. Yeah, I know. Why should you have all the fun? Ooh! [KEN CHUCKLING] VALENTINE: [CHUCKLING] Okay. Oops. Good night.Good night. Good night, sweetheart. Daddy, Macaroni wants to know why you never kiss him. Oh, come here you little rat. [CHUCKLING] Mother, are you gonna take me to see Daddy race? Of course I will. [DOOR CLOSES] [SIGHS] VALENTINE: What is it? Hmph, I'm not sure. Something about seeing you with Jason like that, I just wanted to make love to you. Oh, that's lovely. Why didn't you tell me that you lost your business? I couldn't. You were holding so many things back from me. You kept talking about communicating. I couldn't admit it to myself, much less you that I was failing. Hey. Val, I never failed before. You don't know how I feared that. Oh, the whole thing's a mess. Everyone's failed before, everyone. I'll never love you less for that. Do you still love me, huh? Yes, I do. But I can't go back to the old relationship. What does that mean? Letting you work at that raunchy dive? If I want. Do you? No. [LAUGHS] But I'm glad I worked there. I mean, if I can survive that then I could work anywhere. I don't want to be protected anymore. Are you sure? Because I like protecting you. Yeah, you made me feel like a child. Okay, I realize that. So what are you gonna do? Uh, start over. Get the money back? Get the dealership back.Mmm-hmm. You can do it. I believe in you. And listen, if you need any help, I'm a working woman now. Oh, yeah? How'd you like to work for me, uh, as a saleswoman? My tits aren't big enough. [CHUCKLING] You have lovely tits.Thank you. Oh, Val. It's such a relief that the whole thing is over. I... I put on that business suit and I took that job. It didn't fit me. See, it fit my father. It didn't fit me. It just sort of snowballed and I got caught up in doing something I didn't want to do. Well, what do you want to do? [CHUCKLING] I'm not sure. Maybe I'll, uh, do something with Woody. Yeah, maybe I'll go into business with Woody. I'll do some racing on the weekends. But what I'm sure I wanna do is I wanna spend as much time as I can with you and the little guy in there. I need you. You've never said that to me before. Yeah, there are a lot of things I've never said before. Come back. I promise I'll try and change. I can see you've already changed. You smell so good. Yeah, well, I had a bath, thanks to you. You taste good too. [MOANING AND KISSING] Come here. What are you doing? Don't move. [CHUCKLING] Val, you know I can't handle you when you get sexy like this. Don't talk. [CHUCKLING] Oh! Ah! Now wait a minute, I thought we were talking. You are too much. [CHUCKLING] [ENGINES REVVING] Go for it, Daddy! [CHUCKLING] I forgot how nervous I used to get. JASON: Go! Stop worrying, honey, he knows what he's doing. JASON: Go! Go, Daddy, come on. Step on it, Ken! [GASPING] He's all right. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMING] One more to go! Yeah, that's it! You can do it! [CHEERING] VALENTINE: Ken!
