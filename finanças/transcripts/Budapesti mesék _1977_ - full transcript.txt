Oh, no! A tram! - Really. - How did it got here? - A city tram? The city can't be far. Let's push it! We can wait here until it stops raining. We could even sleep here, couldn't we? - Yes, now that we're a bigger company. - There's a plenty of room. Yes, there is. Don't make fire on the floor, it might spread all over. - The city can't be very far. - Have you been there. - No. And you? They say it's a nice city. The tracks on the railway bed will surely run to the tram-depot. - Where? - To the tram-depot. - Do you know where that tram-depot is? - l don't. But somewhere near. At the end of the tracks. The tram draws into the depot or the tram pulls out the depot. - What is a tram-depot? - lt's a large roofed hall at the edge of the city. That's where the trams are taken for the night or for repairs. lt's a kind of a centre. All tracks meet there and part again. A tram-depot! The depot is always built in the outskirts and never in the centre which is always crowded and can block the fast movements. So the trams can easily reach any point of the city through the network of tracks. - How do you know that? - l have learned about it. - How large is such a depot? - lt's huge. There is plenty of room, the sun shines through the glass-roof. - Did you learn this, too? - l wish we already there. - Where do you want to go? - And place with shelter. - Some secure place. - Where we can start something... ls there any secure place nowadays? lt has stopped raining. lt has. Let's put it on the tracks. lt'll roll right into the depot. - lt needs electricity. - We'll push it now and then. Let's load our bags on it, just push it an there we go... We can stop for the night wherever we want. lt will shelter us if the rain starts again. We'll roll up the windows and close the door for the night. Push it! lt won't work this way. Come on, people! Come on, people! Here! Come on! - A city tram! - We should put it on the tracks. Let's push it! Forward! Forward! This way, people! Come here! ln front of me. Here's our bloody army, too. - Come here, boys! - Give us a hand! - Come here! - Right here! Give it a push! All right? - Where are you going? - Straight to the tram-depot. - Where. - There's a tram-depot near the city where all the tracks meet. lt's a junction. The gate to the city. - ls that ''debode'' very far? - Depot! To have this tram with us is already very encouraging, isn't it? And all the tracks meet here. Mother! Help! Now what do you say to this? lt moves by itself. We're on the tracks! - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - We are living. lt's downhill now. We'll have to push it after the curve. - Where are you heading for? - For the city. - Can we join in? Come, get on! Get on! Come on! The murderers! Are we going to take everybody? Attention, please! ln cool and dew-drenched mornings to walk in new sunshine and live through the days again. Bravo! To watch the glow of stars that guard the peace dreams, and follow their bright paths all the way. lt's going to stop. Come here! Help! Push it! Push it! - lt's moving. lt's wonderful. - Give us a hand, you too! - lt's moving really fine. - Don't talk. Push it! - Where're you going? - To the city. Me, too. To the city! l can bring in it. You can cook in it. - Hello, people! - Hello! Hello, people! Hello, people! How beautiful a yellow tram can be! This shade of yellow is just wonderful. How beautiful it will be going down the streets among grey buildings. ln bright light, in rain, sunset. Actually l should be a painter. l can sense the difference between various shades of color very well. How many kinds of yellow do you know? l know at least fifty. Golden-yellow, orange-yellow, citron-yellow, vanilia-yellow, mustard-yellow, sand yellow, wax-yellow, medium and dark yellow, amber-yellow. Some people are color-blind. But l can ell anything from colors. lllness, age, character. Sunflower-yellow, primrose-yellow, flax-yellow... - Golden chain, Lion's tooth, King-cap... - Saffron-yellow... - Candle-light. - Canary-yellow. Yellow as jaundice. A dry, stubble-field, down of a baby-chick. How do you know these? l know. lf l go up to the roof to do my juggling tricks they'll notice us from far away like those majorettes in America. - Be careful, you may fall down. - Stop worrying about me, Mom. Be careful, don't eat too much! Just taste it, no more! Don't stuff it all in your mouth. Be more sensible! You're all going to be sick! Are you crazy, man? You could die. You'll all going to die within an hour! Stop it immediately! Stop it, will you? Don't lose control! Why don't you understand! For God's sake, stop making a pig of yourself! l'm talking to you, too! Your stomach will be torn apart. Don't tuck it in your mouth! Stop it, don't eat so much sugar! Throw it away, listen to me! Did you all go crazy? You will die! Why don't you fill your pockets? Take some with you. Take as much as you can, just don't eat any more Listen to me! Take it with you! - So how you've become the thief of robbers. - Why are you complaining? The people must eat. They can take only from where there is... And they must take it. There's no other way. New commandments? Your principles are changing. But if l let them eat like a horse, what will happen to them? They may even die. Then l'd rather have them rob. Please don't eat sugar! No sugar and no canned food. Take anything but don't eat! - What's that paint for? - l just wat to have some. Why not? Give it a push! The direction is the depot! Push it! - We may take wrong way. - Let's follow the river. Uphill? Which way? l say we should go... - Let's have the doctor decide. - Long live the doctor! - You go ahead and check the upper tracks! - Yes, sir. Firstly. We need a stove in the tram to keep us warm. Secondly: warm soup must be provided for everybody. Thirdly: Women don't have to push the tram, just help a little going uphill. Then we must also eat regularly, we need rest and take care of our health. First of all l am a doctor and whatever else you call me comes only after that. The upper track leads to a destroyed ramp. Then this is our direction. l think you are a little bit shy. l'm thinking of a proper codefication of what the ideal tram ticket should be if we had to define it. They should define the order. To lead them! - Follow me! - Only where l want to go. Come on, people! Wait a minute. Do you want to leave me behind? Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Come on, people! Here! Hello! Stop, stop! Have l been here before? It was snowing Iike this in May when my father died. Get on the tram, l'll examine you. - Look, potatoes, beans! - Look! Lentils! Give it a push, girl. - l've had enough... - They're all malingerers! Will you please get off? You, too. Get off, you, too. Get off! lt's impossible. We won't be able to go on. We'll get stuck here, you too. Let's agree that only those over sixty can stay. What? Be reasonable! We know it's not easy for you either, but you're still young. You are strong. Let's beat the hell out of them. What's up? Stop it, everybody! Stop it! People! What number is this tram? - What number should it be? - Good question. Number 3. Not too many, not too few. - That's a horrible number. - Three. Anything meaning three is good. Sure! We had three casualties a day. Always waiting who will be the third. - The bloodiest number! - Then 4. Four seasons, four weeks, the day has four parts. lt's a secure number. Balanced. - Four evangelists. - Seven. Four and three makes seven. The moon changes seventh day. Man changes every seventh year. - The seven deadly sins. - The seventh day is Sunday. l don't like Sundays. Bad things always started on Sundays. That is when new decrees were passed so that we couldn't do anything. Everything is closed on Sundays. That's when the air-raid started, too. - Do numbers make any difference? - Twelve! One and two. There are 12 months. A day is two times twelve hours. lt's so secure. There were twelve apostles. - No, anything but twelve! - Thirteen. - lt has always been my lucky number. - l was born on the 13th on a Friday. My mother said fourteen because she was afraid it would bring bad luck. My father died on the 13th. lt was a Friday. l even hate to utter this number. To wake up every morning with that number above you. - lf it brings you luck! - lt doesn't. lt means bad luck, mind you! May l suggest seventeen. That was my number in college. - Let's make it five! - Five fingers. - Or twenty-five. Five times five. My husband was 25... Let us not have any number at all. All numbers mean something. A tram must have a number. lt won't work this way! We must listen to everybody's suggestion! Silence, please. Silence! - Why shouldn't we call it number one? - That's it. Let's make it one. The depot is quite far! l believe we can move faster, if we all keep an order. Stop! Morning call at seven! Departure at eight sharp! - Quite a heavy thing a tram is. - Yes, it has quite a weight. Wish l already saw that tram-depot! Why don't you clear out of my way? Why are you so very shy? How beautiful your eyes are. - We're in trouble. We're late. - Late for what? You trying to undermine the morals? That's not the way to make a start. Let's put the clocks back. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning, everybody. Please, stop, will you! Stop! Don't forget to distribute the aspirin in the woods, doc! How are you doing, doc? Our tram is flying like an eagle, Under the blue sky, and the tempest is behind. - Where are you going? - To the tram-depot, darling. - Do you have a seat for us? - One seat? There will be. My husband. He got paralysed of his injuries... - My God, how long we've been on the road. - Come, get on! - Thanks. - A piece of the rail is missing. - Go ahead and check it. Stop! Stop! Everbody stay here! Everybody! - Everybody stay here! - Fine. We should turn back. - Yes. Back to the points. - Not with me! Come and help me! l'll hold it while you're rolling the tram over it. Slide it along very slowly! Push it! Release the brakes, for God's sake! We cannot stop. lf we stop it will roll back. The doctor! The doctor! Get the doctor! l'm alive! l'm alive! l'm alive! l'm alive! l'm alive! You know why you always have a headache? Because we tolerate that officer-like character in our company. Lean your head back and try not t concentrate on your pain. Watch the scenery or think of a woman or anything you find interesting. Do you feel these two hollows on your forehead? You must press your thumbs on it and massage it in small circles. Then you must press stronger and stronger until it grows numb. Then move your first finger the same way first on your eyebrowes and then on your forehead. This way. Then press your fingers again on the two hollows, do the circling massage for two minutes. lntensifying the pressure stonger or weaker. With various pressure. You see, l'm sure it will do you good. l am really good at it. l also had terrible headaches when l had to write petitions. Now l have headaches only when l'm not sure in certain things. - What is that you're not certain of? - Who asked you? l'll tell you how to write a petition. To write a petition, an application or a request in the proper way is a subject worthy of attention. Take a clean sheet of paper. Petitions are always white. You must place the paper on a table or on a hard cover. Wrinkled petitions are no petitions at all, it is handled distrustfully by the addressee. You should write ''Petition'' on the top so everyone can see what it's about. You must wipe your pen after every paragraph or full stop. Never start new paragraph at the margin. This will give you a clear, disciplined form reflecting your faith in truth and it will also enable the reader to insert his comments there. The principle of the petition is the rule of three: Request, justification, expression of thanks. Three clear sentences. Your signature must be precise, easy to read modest, but not humble. Which might arouse annoyance and might indicate your pettiness that exposes you to any power. Date and punctuation should be in their proper places to indicate, that the writer is an educated man. He is familiar with the law and his limits. lf you learn this, you'll never have a headache while writing a petition. lt will be easy, obvious and simple. And don't forget: don't catch a clerk in a lie, he would never forgive you that. Hold me tight. Aren't you afraid? Will you protect me in all troubles? l fell in love... l really fell in love with you. ls it dark? Yes, it is. But l can still see you. l can't see anything. Wait! Wait! l can't see... l can't see... l can't see... - There must be a fire very near. - Maybe forest-fire? - Or the city? We won't stop. There are all kind of gangs behind. More and more of them. We'll cut across the fire! Let's go! Let's push it! Speed up! Come on! Push it! Faster! l still have a fine roll of linen. l still have a fine roll of linen. l'm ready to sell it or trade it for some valuable goods. The dressmaker will gladly make it for you. l would want two blouses for it. What was the color of the tram? lt was yellow. But what kind? There used to be somebody among us who knew all the shades of colors. - Yes. The Window-Man. - That's right. Well, now. l might just as well find that color, too. This is it! - lt's beautiful. - Exactly the same. - Beautiful color. - Not bad. Exactly the same yellow. This is not yellow. He says it's not yellow. lt's a beautiful yellow, isn't it? Nice. - This tram is not yellow. - How do you know? You can't see... l really don't know... l just feel it on my skin. The Sun would reflect yellow differently. l feel it on my face. This is not yellow. This is green. Pale green. Green like the sprouting grass, or a young bud... lt's very much like... Maybe a bit lighter than... That's it. Exactly a shade of green. We must kill this girl. - Don't cause panic! - What can be a threat for me now? She should be trust under the tram. - Did you blush? What's the matter? - She can see! She can't. She can sense the colors. We must send her away at night when there are no colors at all. l can't listen to it! Enough! l can't stand it, don't you understand? This is no salvation, either. The important thing is the air. To inhale it deep and clean yourself in it from time to time. As long as you can. This is a task you must fulfill. lf you travel in any vehicle, be close to the door or the window and don't give up your place for anything. lf anything happens make use of any breaks and take a fast breath. lf you find these breaks, you've already tackled the situation. Do you understand me? lf somebody slaps your face and you can't defend yourself, the only thing you can do is to breath regularly. You must force the rhythm of normal situations to gather strenght. Always take a good breath. lt radiates calmness so your attackers will be surprised. They won't understand your discipline. There is nothing more important than good breathing. l've learned that. That's what counts. - 125. You can do more if you want... - Nice job, girl. Keep up training. What have you sold to me? This is junk! Look here! What is this? You've fouled everybody. Look here, people! Look this! ls it good material? - Look, what is this? - lt's a shame! l've given him three comicsbooks. Let me see yours! He has fouled everybody. Exploited our credulity. He has made quite a profit. How many tricks did you do before? You were the one who released the brakes when we run over that man. - l just held my tongue! - You told me to... How dare you lie with a straight face? Are you trying to twist my words? Are you abusing others? Who are you? Where did you came from? l am the one who found the tram. He was also there. He looked into it. Tell him! - The doctor was also there. - The doctor! Don't yu happen to come from the same place where the doctor was from? l do. As a matter of fact we even discussed that l had known his mother. So that's it? You have joined forces to beat up these unfortunate soldiers. Scraping your little wealth together. You even look like the doctor as l can see. So you would like to see the doctor here as our leader? - l didn't say that. - Show me your palm. You've got the same soft palms, just like the doctor. You don't seem to have pushed the tram too much. lt's because of the shaving cream and l often have to wash my hands. My hands must be clean when l shave. ls this what you call clean? l'm asking you... Take your bags and get away from here. Take it! - What will happen to us? - We must remain calm. Listen to me. l have a card which reads: Take it easy! A remainder from my brother. My grandfather got it from his brother. l always keep it in my pocket, whatever may happen, that's what l think of. lf it doesn't help, l touch my pocket. lf even that is not enough, l take it out and read it. l'm concentrating on the card: Take it easy! Calm down! lf you repeat the words ''calm down'' five times without any bad thoughts coming to your mind, then you've won. l swallow once and that's it. lt's all over. Why do you swallow? lt means that you've defeated it for good and all. Understand? You've won. Calmness. lt's all over. lt's easy for the religious people. They think of their God and saved. God might have proved his existence to me quite a few times. Everybody, please get on the tram! lt's not safe to stay outsite this time. Didn't you hear it? Get on, everbody! Come on! Move! Come on! - What time is it? - Seven. Are you sure you can see it? l would need some rest. - Where is that damn barber? - The bastard took it on the lam. People are coming. Hello, people! Come with us! People! - What's the matter with you? - l feel dizzy. l feel sick. A slope! A slope! Run! Quick! Quick! - Run! - Come on! Run! Run! Be careful! Will you tell them, sonny, to be careful! You bastard! Leave him alone! Go away, do you hear? They're ready to kill each other. Say something, darling. Speak! No need to worry. As you see we are all under the tram. Don't be afraid, they're going to got us out in a minute. Take his hand and talk to him! Say something, darling. Say that you're all right... Say something! He has escaped again. We've made it again. The trouble begins when you start bleeding. l don't mean there can be no trouble without blood, but when bloodness troubles arises you can do something against them. Cleaning or disinfection would do, but blood is dripping fast. There are three types of hemorrhage: capillary vessel, varicose, artery. Hemorrhage of the capillary vessel is a trifle. Black, dark blood of the varicose vein is more dangerous. This case you must use a lingature. The hemorrhage of the artery is the most dangerous one: bright red blood squirts from the wound. And if we don't give immediate aid to the victim, he will bleed to death in no time. You must apply a strong ligature and press the artery above the wound with your fingers. lf there's no other way, you must reach into the wound with a clean hand. The only task is to keep the victim alive. The only thing is not to let him bleed to death. There's nothing more important in life than this. l've learned this many times. l saw my child bleeding to death. Also my mother and my husband. Get out of my way! You're responsible for all these! This is it! My prayers were not in vain. You'll have to give them bath every day in a water of 34 or 37 degrees, about body temperature. First comes the face with a soft wash-cloth, no soap, just clean water. You must wash their head and hair twice a week with a soap and with a not to soaked wash-cloth. lf soapy water gets into their eyes, it will irritate them. You must clean all other parts of their body with wash hands or clothes. You must dry the water with soft linen don't rub their skin. Put some sunflower oil all over their body every day, so their skin will be beautiful and healthy. Go and tell them! Don't be ashamed. l'll check it. The tram-depot! lt's huge. The depot! The depot! Wait! Let's not tell them. Tomorrow morning they'll wake up and see. Beautiful, isn't it? Yes, it is. The depot! But then where is the city? We should post a guard. l might just as well stay up for the night. Leave me alone, you bastard! You sons! - The depot. - ls that the depot? So small? This must be it. This is the depot. But where is the city? This is an engine-house. Here's the last stop. This can't be the tram-depot, yet. l am sure. - We might as well stay here. - To waste time? Let's stay for a while. We'll do any harm. - We could take a rest for a day or two. - For a week or two! Let's think about it. We are on our way. The city can't be too far. This seems to be something like an outer assembly hall. - Engine-house. - Maybe. l vote for moving on. - Me, too. - Me, too. So do l. We must heading for the city from the tram-depot, anyway. Let's rest for a day at least. - Don't talk so much! - Don't address me! l'm going to stay. - Let's not waste time. Let's go! - Who asked your opinion? - Too smart again? - Why are you gibbering? You should be happy just to be here. Right? Number 13. Here we go! Leave it to me, l'll hand it out. God damn you! Damn you! Stand up for God's sake! l am not going to leave behind like a perishing animal. Thank you. You see, how shy you were. l always thought of you. - Why did you go to bed with F?nyes? - l imagined you there. Do you mind that l've told you? lt would be nice to have a house in a quiet place not to near to the city. - There is some matter with my heart. - Where? - Here. - Your heart causes pain in your back. l've been dizzy for days. And my head... lt must be blood pressure. Here, where your life-line is broken. l see something in the waves. Water is mighty, water will defeat you. There is nobody among us who could help you. l don't know why. Hurry! Do you see how short it is? Run away! Look for the one you can love, the one can trust if you are in need, if you are afraid. lf you reach this point of life, you'll need something to lean to. What a wave! What a depth. Show me your palm! What a long life-line. You'll have many beautiful lovers. Don't you see she's lying? You'll be alone! Calm down. Just a passing mood. You are easily thrown off balance you are frightened. Like a scale. lt's sinful to lie and to cheat. - How could you bear all these? - What? Those you trust and believe will not save you from the tide. Will you read my fortune? Come here, just between two of us. Listen to me! Don't spread your fears, or l'll throw you in the river like a cat! You're filling them with terror, causing panic. They may lose control and that is harmful for all of us. Did you understand me? Stop it! Or say something that will keep us together. Something that unites. Now get out of here! How long shall we stand each other? Why do we all hate this barber? Because he sold us the linen? He works day and night, he worked for the linen, too. lt was his only wealth. He wasn't asking much for it. But we still hate him. You take it out on the first man if things don't look as good as should. On those, who are near to you. l'm afraid you'd also have him between up if you were in trouble. Me? Why? Because you're hot-blooded, you easily lose your control. - Do you like the barber? - l have nothing against him. We've been together from the very beginning. The others might accuse you of conspiring with him. This would make you scared and you'd start proving yourself. There is no salvation. There isn't. l'd prefer to say there's no need for salvation. You are what you are. But it doesn't make you clever to know this. You must use it to achieve the good things... Damn it! My problem is that l can never express myself. lt's terrible. l can't tell anything the way l would like to. People! Listen to me, l have an idea. Let's go back for the tram. Take it into pieces and bring them over here. Everybody takes a piece so we could assemble it here again. Bravo! - How about you? - This is where we live. Look! Don't help me! Where is this frame? Window number eleven. We can't find it. - lt's missing. - Missing. Who brought it over? Never start such a work, that... Never take such a work... All right, old man Let's push it! Push it! Push it! Well... People, l wouldn't call it a perfect job. - How did you assemble it? - What the hell have you done again? You'll never be able to assemble it again the same way. That's for sure. You have no idea! lt won't work this way. And if we can't do it, we won't do it. They wouldn't help for anything. No matter what the trouble is they're just standing there. The best thing would be to forget about the whole crap! Never let them take you in! lf you've got just a little sense, yo should do your own business. l could be an assistant in a nice, warm workshop by now. l would even be ready to clean it if l were told to. - Do you want me to believe this? - Why not? - l want you. - l want you, too. Believe me. But l can't. l couldn't go back. My husband would notice it and it would be terrible. Do you know how many different ways a man can lean on you? He may want come along, too. He may help you, he may hold on to you, he may give up, he may even want to stay on the ground, dragging you down. But when he is ready to start again, when he helps me again, l no longer feel his weight. But then he's going to lose his faith and l can feel he's going to crush me. That's all. Wishing you all the best. - You'll catch cold, sonny. - l won't. l've had enough. l want to be left alone, understand? Just for this one time in my life, l want to be left alone! You're in love with somebody but she doesn't love you. l can't protect you. l'm not in love with anybody! l'm going to leave you here! l hate this bloody tram! l hate to pushing it. There is no tram-depot. We only invented it. l don't believe in you, l don't believe in anything. The others might have faith, but l don't. l don't want to be a leader. l don't want to have the power. l only want to do something that l myself believe in. Which has meaning or something that would justify me. l only have one life, and it's terrible to see the days passing by without any joy, while our whole life is getting ever shorter until everything is soon over. - Be patient! - l'm patient. Don't you see l'm no longer the brilliant looking littl kid that you still believe l am? l am over 30. You already had children at this age. l want to have a child with someone. Do you understand? l want children instead of chanting empty slogans of wisdom. l don't want to guard the beautiful family albums that you have collected. How to pack a backpack so that nothing important is left out? Toothbrush to keep your breath fresh. Soap to wash yourself to refresh your body. A scarf to wipe your forehead if you're sweating. Salt. Put it in water and you've got something to eat. Red pepper to color your food. lt's important to eat with gusto. Tea, if your water tastes bad you can make it palatable Medicine: pain-killer, something for tooth-ache. Tranquillizer, you are helpless against pain. Take a lot with you and have it ready for everbody. Don't give loans. Those who owe you money, don't like you. Don't forget some old photographs. To give you strenght. A watch. You must know what are the things that you consider valuable. Do the selection so that everything could be packed into a backpack. - The trouble is that we're in a valley. - He's right. Let's push it up to that middle of the slope. Then the water will run out. Damn you all! How long? How long will it last? How dirty l am! Did you get numbed? You little rascal! Aren't you coming to daddy? Come here, quick! That's it. - We're alive. - Life is beautiful. lf you have good health. That's the most impotant. Were you also scared? You were scared, too? l was. - And you? - Me, too. Were you also scared? Have l seen this before or did l just dream about it? Why are you always tormenting me with your dreams? There are some presents here. - Are you scared? - No, l'm not. See how talented l am? We've got you, now my Lord! Say, what can you see! lt's good to decorate a Christmas tree once in a while. And to lay a table, too. l don't know why but sometime it's so good to live... l'm only afraid of getting old... Do you know what is it like when you wish another person's death? - You are beautiful. - She'd want every man. - Tell me, why are you still with us? - Do you have better idea? What shall l crave on the tree? ''l am here'' or ''l was here''? You see l have the adventage. l have children. What will you have, lf trouble comes hold them tight and don't let them go. You are free to go, if you want. l can't go on living like this. The terrible thing is that l love you very much. Aren't we having too big party? Never undertake a job that you're not qualified to carry out. Get to know yourself. And your own values. Think of your future for one minute. Try it. Look at my face for a minute and think for your personal future. Well, let's go. We are alive.
