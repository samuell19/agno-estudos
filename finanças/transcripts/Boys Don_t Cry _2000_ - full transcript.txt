Dear children, the time has come when the lovable hedgehogs set out for their wandering trips. Unfortunately, very often the paths they are carelessly frisking along, intersect busy highways... ...full of speeding, dangerous motor-cars. Drivers squash those sympathetic creatures to bloody mush... ...but it doesn't have to be that way. A little bit of good intentions would be enough and..... What was that? Did we hit some dog? I reckon a porcupine. What do you mean: "a porcupine"? It's kind of a big hedgehog. Grucha, are you really that dumb? There aren't such animals living in this country. We have: a bison, beaver, fuck elk, fox, wolf, marten... horse... Otter, shrew and rabbit are the animals living in Poland... It doesn't matter what it was, since now it is gone. But here you are mistaking, Grucha. Do you know what 'reincarnation' is? Have you ever heard in your lifetime such a l-o-n-g expression? To put it simply, it means that after death, man is reborn into a different form. For example as an animal. Maybe you've just run over one of your kin... your uncle or your cousin... Hell I did! My cousin is alive and works for television. And the case? What are you thinking about, Grucha! You laugh about...reincarnation. You don't give a damn about it... ...but it's an ancient and wise religion, not for dimwits like you. What you become in your next life depends on how you lead your present life this far. After death some take on the form of a tiger, falcon or a leopard... And others? Regarding you I don't foresee anything grand... A duck... is the max of what you can become. Why do you chaw on my chips? Can't you buy your own? I'm not hungry. If you're not hungry than let off of these chips... ...and if you are then buy some. - You see, what food is doing to your brain? Aside of this roll and chips the world doesn't exist to you. It's only a piece of a fucking potato and you're acting as if I was violating your mother. I'm going to take a leak, Grucha, 'cause I don't wanna watch this. - You, we have a business. - Yeah? What? - Give up the case. - I don't have the key. Tough luck to you. Gentlemen, one moment. Are you going to chop off my hand because of some fucking case? How am I going to look like? At least a-symmetrical... I don't want to be crippled for the rest of my life. I have a family, holiday plans, I am... a businessman. I need this hand to work on my laptop and to scratch my ass. I'm sure, I have... ...the key in question somewhere here. Then start looking for it, sugar, now! - Very well. - Oh, sorry. - You fucking dick. What have you fucking done to me, you thug? Stop whining... Boys don't cry. It had to be so wonderful. This is the answering machine of Kuba Brenner. Leave your message after the beep. Kuba, I know you are not home, because of your exam. - Oh, shit! That's why I chose this moment to tell you something important. Maybe I should have done that eye to eye with you, but I was unsure of your reaction. I wanted to tell you that I am leaving you. Thank God! I know I dealt you a blow, but that's life. Don't blame it on yourself- this is how I am: a little bit crazy, eccentric, unpredictable... I don't want you to suffer, but you didn't think I'd stay with you forever, did you? Not in a lifetime! I met someone. He's name is Jarek. I have a feeling like he's my second half. Motherfuck!! I don't want to hurt you, Kuba. You must be strong. I'm sure you gonna meet many women to take in my place. You forgot to mention my father! Your father was a great conductor, and you... you cannot even take care of your own business. Jarek says: in life you have to be a shark if you don't want other sharks to get you. Jarek is a shark and also undertaking. But why I'm telling you all this? Kuba you must be strong. Don't do anything stupid. I loved you. Where the fuck are my 300 big-ones, you hear? Where the f... There are more important things in life than your 300 big-ones. Like for example 600 big-ones. Did you say goodbye to that artistic destitute? Exactly why couldn't I use your phone? You won't be using my cell to call your ex-honeys, baby. Hop on in. I beg of you, don't do this to me. - Hi! - How are you. What's going on? - What do you think? - I told you to sell that clunker. I have to have it back by five. - Thanks, Cichy. Kuba, do you know what time it is? - I'm so sorry. There's our star... Mr. Brenner apparently chooses his own exam schedule. Excuse me mister dean, but I couldn't make it earlier... ...l had to help a blind person to cross over the street. Such a twist of faith. I'm ready anytime for my exam. That's great but the exam has just ended. Such a twist of faith. I invite you back in autumn for the re-exams. But mister dean, we could go back and listen to Kuba playing. Exam has ended. Dear colleague... such an indulgency towards the students is inadmissible. They might start thinking that we are here for them. Rudolf, do something! I could prescribe you something new but I doubt it would help anyway. Why take something that's not going to help? - That's true... Well, actually there isn't any effective treatment against acne. Do you have a girlfriend? Like everybody... You see, I don't... No, no... I meant not for going steady... I know... a lot very well, ...some less... ...other... in general... just from seeing... Do you have... sex... with women? Or men, it doesn't matter. Maybe it doesn't matter to you! I'm sorry.... Hallo, Magda? Hi, Oskar speaking. You don't know Oskar who? Do you remember, one month ago you were at this club, "13"... ...and that attractive blond guy wearing black jersey was making advances to you? Yeah, he asked if he could join you... Yes, he'd get those dimples when smiling... He was with a friend... That's right, at that moment I was seating two tables away. They told me you are... direct and willing, so I thought that maybe... What is this? It's a steak, sir. - I can see it's a steak. But where are the chips? You must be mistaking, sir. I am what? You want to say something else? Take it away. If I wanted it without the chips then I'd say: 'without the chips, please', right?! You are so tough. - I'm a city guy. You are mentally so strong. - Fucking strong. I always look people in the eye when I'm talking to them... I don't make any unnecessary moves. The first ten words are enough, first five amigo's gestures and I know, that in his psyche fear is lurking. He's not aware of the fact that he's just about to foul his pants. You know why? Because his weak psyche just mailed his inching turd, saying there's a meeting down his trousers. This is incredible... I have to go to the john. What do you mean: I should get a hooker? Like I said. You wanted my advice? Here's my advice: go to a brothel. Well I think, I'm not the type a prostitute would go for. Man, she doesn't have to like you, but you have to like her. That's her job. Yes, but I just couldn't live with the thought she's doing it only for the money. You want to cure your acne, right? Then look at it as a kind of medication... like going to the drugstore. - No. - What: 'no'? I'm not going. I think recently the national team has made considerable progress. Hey, Krzysiu, don't you exaggerate. - I think in our days things were better. Possibly. A 40 years old, big breasted Basia? Not for me. A quiet married woman to serve you? Not unattractive Jacek, with ambiance... Not this... Epilated Krysia?... Loose that... I've got something for you: "Looking for a master to do with me as he pleases?. "Replies with a short description of the drill?. Are you mad? Maybe instead of a hooker I should visit some healer, like Kaspirowski. I wouldn't recommend it. I went to Harry from Tibet. I wanted him to jam pack me with energy. The guy touched my neck, graced my thighs and charged me 1,5 big-ones. And then? My neck is fucking killing me and I have developed rash on my thighs. You know, thinking of handing over all of this cash is giving me a headache. That's the difference between us: you plan on a short term. Your ceiling is my ground floor. I'm already counting those suitcases we'll be getting for this gag. Don't you fucking miscalculate. We are in town and we've got the money. They are here. Shame I didn't come up with this. - Or me. These boys are clever. They must have good channels and a cinched buyer. And they keep their lips sealed. I'd have much to offer to take over that business. I could talk to them, my way, and then bury them in the woods. Do not underestimate them, Silnoreki. We gonna bamboozle them my way. I'm not following you, boss. That's why I am your boss and not the other way round. Good News Foundation - Charity for the Poles in Kazakhstan Remember the half of the dough is mine! Don't worry, Grucha. We pay them 20% of the total value and receive gorgeous and brand-new tubs. As soon as we get them over the border you can spend the rest of your life farting in your stool. When do we pay the rest of the money? - The rest of the money: never. Behind the eastern border the cars gonna dissolve into thin air with us along-side. Hallo? Agency "Black Lotus"? Me and my friend wanted to arrange for two girls. What do you mean: 'two'? - You're not deserting me now... You are experienced in that field. First you tell me how great it is, entice me and now you're backing off. Bud... I... just don't have funds. But I do, so do feel invited. I would like a girl of a classic beauty, not common... She should have sapphire-blue eyes, sensual lips... graceful way of moving, ...an unobtrusive smile... ...well-shaped bosom. In other words: she should be the quintessence of femininity. Yes. And for my friend? It doesn't matter. What do you mean: 'it doesn't matter'? Have you seen our father? How is he doing? That's good. Tell him I'll be sending money next week. Yes, I have to go. Bye-bye. Anything for my boss? No more from the gangster genre: he's already seen them all. Excuse me. I have to go... The agency paged me up. And this one? "Death in Venice", what is it? It's a new one, haven't seen it yet... but the subject matter should be similar. Do you have a condom? Yes. Lend it to me. I only have one. No problem, you can do it without. But I'm already wearing it. You're wearing a condom since this morning? Who are you? Laska. You, Oskar, you did arrange for the girls, right? - This is Laska, my uncle's son, he lives here. Are you in your quiet period?... Won't you ask him how he's doing? As usual... riding on his board and smoking joints. Well, hi there. I'm Angelique and this is Samantha. And you, sir? - I am the travel-agent. Wuzz up? Let me see your membership-card. Here you are. Okay. Gentlemen... the ladies will stay for one hour. The rate is one hundred. There are two ladies, so this means: two hundred. Additional hundred for every anomaly. Tipping ladies is your own business. There won't be any anomalies... ...we are normal. Aye... Let me pay right away, then. It's not necessary. We trust our exclusive clients. Thank you and have a nice evening. Bye, girls. We are not in a hurry, are we? Maybe we should first talk a little. What about then? I don't know... about your job or... The job is like any other. In general when the guy is on top of me, I'm thinking about something else, right... ...say... like about princess Di, new washing-machine, about quiz questions in Wheel-of-Fortune. And when the client is exceptionally ugly, then I close my eyes and fantasize I'm screwing DiCaprio. Laska, go to your room. I need intimacy. You gonna offer me a cigarette? - A cigarette? Yes, of course. What do you want to do? After the university I want to do commercial graphics. I asked what you wanted to do now. And you? You are very tense. Relax a little. I wonder what the parents would say. Don't worry about them... They are convinced I'm studying geography. No, no... I meant my own parents. How long are you working as a whor... prost...? For the agency? For three days now. I'm just starting. And your real name is Samantha? No... Lilliana. Everybody calls me Lilly. We should get to know each other better. Tell me something about yourself. I like Italian music... and comic books about captain Zbik. Do you sometimes listen to classical music? Beethoven?... What do you want, damn? You are approaching the whole thing like a dog approaching a hedgehog. Do you want to get laid or not? I mean... yes... ...and no... Captain Zbik was a cool dude. In the issue "Music-box lighter" he's cracking down an international gang of diamond smugglers and... What are you laughing about? You are really something else. You know... until now I was meeting those boring businessmen, telling me about their work and money. You are different. Don't think I'm saying this to all of my clients, but I really like you. You've got passion. Is this going to be your first time? Yes. What is the matter? One hour is up. But I didn't even had a chance to open my fly. You can book another one. I don't have that much money. How much would it be for another five minutes? Whether you take another hour or the party is over! Here you go. What is this? Like we agreed: 200 zloty. We charge in dollars. Converted to zloty you still owe me 630. No, no... I protest. This is a mislead of a client and I'm not gonna pay. We shall see about that. Man, don't be such a materialist... you need to relax. Okay, let's make a deal: 200 zloty and as a bonus this priceless Argentinean cactus. Fuck that cactus! You have just wrecked someone's car. - That will teach him to park in a garage. And you, buddy... Quiet! Fuck, it's my own! And now you owe me five times as much, comprendo? I've got another 100 zloty in my pocket. Hey man, let him go. - No! Don't let me go! Czesiek... let us then take some art. This figurine looks like made of gold. No! This is a priceless article, an African wizard, don't you even touch it! Girls, we are leaving this place. Why did I listen to you, Kuba, why? My God... You know what? We gonna get that figurine back. I don't know how and if, but I know we gonna get it back. That's what I like. This is what it's all about. About what? Look at the way they are moving around. Those cat-like moves... those hand gestures... Why should our boys swing like that? Why, why? To not to look like slabs of reinforced concrete. Polish gangster is not relaxed. He moves like a dray loaded with coal. We could use some ?lan and finesse... in this sad like fuck city. Ain't that the truth... nigga? Bolec, I'd prefer you not to call me a nigga. Not when the other boys are around. Chill out now. Soon everybody is going to talk like that. You only have to introduce certain examples. Now you try... It's simple... No, I'd better not... - What: no? Try this. Can you feel it? Yeah, I feel it. You see how simple it is. I can't hear a thing. Okay, okay... It's enough now... ...nigga... Hallo? - Nigga? Bolec, are you mental? Here's Silnoreki speaking. You're about to receive guests. - Am I getting cable? He asks if he's getting cable. Give me this airhead. Tomorrow at eight two guys from the coast shall deliver my dough at your place. What dough? - Doesn't matter... Are they gangsters? Businessmen... Is that clear? Dad, why at my place and not at yours or Silnoreki's? Because that's what I've decided, sonny. I'm gonna meet them at your club... ...but I could be a little late. So in the meanwhile you gonna take care of the entertainment. You have to prepare ground for doing business. But tomorrow I'm busy! - How so? Fridays I'm working out. You also have a club and a personal- relations agency, I bought you... ...and that's why you gonna meet them and give them a good time like they've never had. You mean, like how? - How... You think for a moment... I'm listening... You take the most beautiful girls, the best booze and as much coke as you can carry, clear? When one of them opens the faucet in the john, it's gonna spring Johnny Walker, you understand? If he wants to screw a black girl... - There are no black girls working for the agency! Then you gonna have to paint black one of our boys. Everything must be in plentiful supply. - And if?... And if they desire to visit the museum of aerospace... ...then you gonna take them to that museum, mother-humping fuck! There are some Cossacks from the coast coming over... ...and we have to show them, that the Cossacks from the capitol know how to party. I don't know if it's wise to leave them with... Bolec... He might not be able to cope when they start to push. If my son wants to count in the city, he cannot familiarize only with hookers. Let him be with them for an hour... he's not a bison for us to protect him. Can't you get up and open the door? The day before yesterday I was doing the TV's-volume. Any slicks living here? Slicks? No, I'm living here. - Then give me a fiver. Is this some kind of an organized project? A project for you to give me a fiver. Thanks, bro! Mate... Would you mind not blowing your pipe when we're chopping here? It distracts us a little. I'm sorry. The dean is waiting. Do you know why I called for you? - I don't want to guess. I've got two announcements for you. - Please give me the bad one first. They both are bad. Because of the fact that you didn't pass your exam for main instrument... ...l have decided that you are not going to represent our academy on the contest in France. But that's my chance of a lifetime... I've been bustling the program for six months now. Learn modesty, sonny. At your age I was making an extra buck by giving private lessons. Next contest will be in four years time- it's gonna be too late for me. Enough, Brenner! Not everything is evolving around you. Why this aversion towards me? Once you were college buddies with my father. - It's not an aversion: I just don't like you. I think you've got no talent. Your father was also over-advertised as a conductor. He made a career, because he was cunning and had a pretty face. One Brenner in the history of music is more than enough. And that's also the second announcement. Don't bother showing up for the re-exam, for you already have failed it. Maybe you're right. I'm glad we both agree. - Me too. My father was often mentioning you, when he was telling about his college days. Really? Yeah... He'd say that when they were on a girl-hunt and took Zajaczek along, they would never score. Get out and start looking for something else to do, sonny. Don't call me sonny... ...you are not my father. Pawn-shop You have to pee now, get it? When the guests arrive: you disappear. They can't see us together. Well, hi! I'm Bolec. - Andrzej. You've got sweaty hands. I've just washed them. - Fred. What's going on in the big world, boys? - Aren't you reading the newspapers, then? Well then... come upstairs. The boss isn't here yet, but that's no prob. We drink some vodka, we get some butt. Or the other way round... Black Lotus 'evening! That's my pit-bull. Very aggressive... I have to lock him up 'cause if he doesn't know someone... ...he's going straight for the throat. I like ferocious dogs. Don't you get all nervous, the boss will be here in no time. All's swell. Do you like black rhythms? This is one good track. Draw a line? - No, not now. Maybe later. Well... what the hell... Sorry... Excuse me... I got the tingles in my nose. Hope you don't take this amiss. - I won't kill you... For now... Look brother, just watch their moves. Don't you think polish boys could use some loosening up? Catch those cat-like action... Blacks could teach us a lot. 'Coco Jumbo and forward!' - that's my creed... Neat, huh? Sometimes I regret I wasn't born black. Hey, boys... Maybe you want to watch a movie? I'm watching a couple of movies a day. Chases, shootings, gang wars... That's my daily bread. I have this fucking excellent new film: "Death in Venice". Sounds good, huh? Don't worry... It will enliven in a moment. Hey, what's your name again, 'cause I forgot? Kolec? Stolec? - Bolec. Now you listen very carefully... Bolek. Have you ever been to the States? No. But you see, I know someone who did and he told me the one and the other. Do you know how blacks arrived in America? From Africa. That's right. Slave drivers brought them from Africa. You think it's that easy to land on the beach of Africa... ...catch in the net one nimble and strong negro and transport him over the ocean? Didn't think so... - Of course not. They only managed to pull this off by getting those who either weren't able to dodge the net... ...or were the tribe's numbs, who got sold by the chief for a pack of fags... ...for they were of no use either way... And all those washouts went to America, got married, had children. Life went on: computers rolled in, as did amphetamine, airplanes. But what good is it, when their hearts are still pumping the same blood... They are descendants of the man who got caught in a net in his own backyard... So I don't think our boys lack loosening!! Comprehend? Grucha, open the case. This is a lot of dough. Your boss disdained us by not showing up to collect it personally. He'll be right here. - Don't interrupt me when I'm convoking my thoughts! I have swallowed that insult thinking: the most important thing now is to nail down this deal. No problem, we will nail down this deal. You have a pit-bull looking like badger-dog, you dangle like a fucking monkey... ...you rave about mister Kunta Kinte, you waste my buddy's line of best powder available... ...and in the end you show us a movie about a guy in a boat... And you want us to nail down a deal? Exactly... who the fuck you really are... you buffoon...? Indeed... not everything went as it should to, but it can be repaired. The girls will be right here and we'll nail down this deal. After what I saw here, I don't even think I'd want to nail down a fly in the piss-pot, together with you... Something on your arm got smudgy... Good evening. Excuse me for disturbing... I'm here for the African wizard. Who the fuck is this? I don't know him. But the gentlemen over there does. I don't think so... It's about that wizard. I'm here to get it back. I've got... ...the money... Every clod can walk in here just like that? Do you have a rod? What? Ah, rod... Sure. Then shoot him. How so...shoot him? Just like that. In here? ...Now?... ...When everybody's watching? If it's of any help to you, then I'm going to take a leak... I'll drop by later on. You, Bolek... you've got balls? Then shoot! This must be some kind of an understanding. I don't know what's going on! I'll show you... what's going o...! What the fuck have you done? You've made a big mistake. You wanted to scam Fred and now Fred is going to scam you. Gonna heal in two shakes! I didn't mean to! Now you've really fucking pissed me off. Wait! Don't do it! It was an accident... I... Oh my God! What is this? - Where? There. Fired up they have... ...them boys. The case... Please, don't do this to me. Everything all right? The boy had a gun and before we knew he was popping us, as if we were ducks. We brought the money according to the deal. Because someone at your club nicked it, makes it your concern. Easy now, stress out... At your place my buddy got gunned down and the cash snatched. This is not what I call the famous polish hospitality. Somebody will have to square the accounts. We'll find that chap. In this city nobody amasses 1,5 mil without my knowledge. Listen to me... - YOU!... listen to me... No use crying over spilt milk. I could say: no money - no merchandise... ...but I want to do business and not to let one fly. Give me one week to straighten things out; we'll find the boy and the money. And if you don't? - Then I'll ship the goods. We have to prepare our declarations. Please tell me, madam... ... honestly. Why did you kill lawyer Rolski? Tadek... ... this is a different case. "Attention fierce dogs" "Mother and child clinic" All that show business is one big sham. Are you the one from that club shooting? So? I've got good news for you: your buddy is alive. What buddy? The one... with the hole in his head. We already put him in the morgue when somebody alert noticed that the dead is still having a pulse. He was extremely lucky... ...the bullet hit titanium plate replacing his forehead bone. What the fuck is he : Robocop? Such substitutes are being placed after, for example, heavy injury. That plate changed bullet's trajectory... ...but the hit-intensity was of such severity it could have caused... ...malfunction of a number of brain functions. Did he say anything about me? He's in coma. When will he wake up? Maybe tomorrow, maybe in six months time... No-one knows. May I stay a little longer... with my friend? It's you, mother... ...fucker. You spend a lot of time with him. It must be someone very important to you. A friend? - Yes... My best buddy. Why is he looking so red in the face? He's allergic for pollen. When he wakes up he'll have to radically change his way of life. No more girls, no more alcohol, not to mention other stronger substances. You mean drugs? We don't want our buddy to turn into a vegetable, do we? No, of course not. I'm telling you... ...l have had it with this Fred, this mother-fucking-ass-wrenched-cunt. He calls me every day at 6 am... ...and asks about the dough. Even when I was doing time nobody would wake me up that early. Silnoreki sent out people around the city, but nobody could tell for whom the boy was working. For nobody. It was some accidental boob. That accidental boob killed two people and almost bumped you off. It was me who shot Grucha. You? Didn't mean to... I mean... I killed him but he's alive. He's in a hospital, in coma... Thus: zero problem! 1,5 mil at sea means zero to you? Listen... Listen carefully... ...what I am going to tell you. You made a big boo-boo and you are going to clean it up yourself. Thanks to me, until now you were just hanging around at your club, watching movies about black men. But I'm not gonna live forever. I can't keep correcting your errors. And I can't keep asking in the city to be excused. The time has come for you to take the affairs into your own hands and leave your warm-hole. I'm gonna tell you now what to do. First of all: Grucha may not wake up. - I'm working on that one already. Secondly: the case may not be found. Don't get it... I want to take over their business. In order to do so I have to know who's in it except for Fred... ...learn about their channels, reach the buyer. So stay close to Fred. Garble the tracks... And call him everyday at 5.30 am. To gain time we'll have to lead him on. In case you do track down the boy, then waste him. Daddy, when I am going to waste somebody? - You, sonny, will not have to. Dad, you never told me I had a brother. Ah... Silnoreki kidnapped him a year ago for ransom. His parents wouldn't pay and so he stayed. Surprise! Why have you come? - Your figurine? It is. Unless you don't want it anymore. You're checking me out and they're waiting outside. Oskar, what is the matter with you? Are you ill? Who: "them"? You said you wanted to see me again, I have some time off, so I dropped by. By me... Excuse me for causing you so much discomfort by bringing you back the figurine and... And what? And nobody sent you? Who had to send me? You simply dropped by for a visit? Listen... I don't know a soul in this city. I found you very nice, so I thought we could... I don't know what I expected coming here. No, no, rather not today. Maybe tomorrow. - Think about it. How is Grucha? He's awake. But something got screwed up in his head- he can't remember the shooting. He keeps staring into the great grey open. Don't know what he's seeing there. Come see for yourself. Excuse me, doctor. He's got cat food instead of a brain. And that pimp of yours doesn't remember a thing either. We have to get Grucha back in shape. They gonna look for you until they have found you. They've got their ways: computers, resident's offices... It may sound unpleasant, but you don't stand much chance trying to escape. Either way it would make no sense escaping- they'd find you anywhere, anyhow. Human life means nothing to them. These are bad people, Kuba, and they are pro's. They can't afford to make a mistake. And you, Kuba... you are their mistake. It's not your fault- you simply were at the wrong place at the wrong time and you gonna have to pay for this. I too was once a mistake in someone's vile life. I just needed a few words of encouragement... Well, then I shall lend you a piece, just in case. Cichy, I am not a gangster, I am a violin player. I don't shoot people. And we have also to pick up your car. - I'm afraid to go back there. You like it? It's a cutie, huh? What is that? - Jericho 941-FB, caliber 9 mm. Was engineered by the Jews to kick the Arabs back to the other side of the Suez Canal. Are there any weaknesses? The kick-back is so strong it could damage your elbow-joint. Do you have something else? Kuba, what are you up to? What do you need that gun for? I thought you were at the university... I came to take some of my stuff. You are in terrible shape- you look like a shadow of a human being. If I knew you'd go thru such a hard time now, I don't think I'd engage with you in the first place. Don't blackmail me with your sorrow. This is the end. I'm not coming back to you. You're not gonna shoot yourself because of me, are you? You are pathetic. Weak-minded. That's why I hooked up with Jarek. With him I feel safe. Isn't that nice. This might surprise you, but Jarek is a gangster. A big fish in the city. We are planning to marry. Recently I met a few gangsters... They are very interesting people. Stop making things up. You and gangsters? Somebody told you a fairytale and you went for it. I am the girl of a real gangster. Goodbye, Kuba. And don't call me. Aha... here are your keys... You don't recall a thing? - Nothing. It's normal with amnesia. It can't be! Spice Girls broke up, would you believe that? The red one ate too much chocolates. Shame, though, she's a fine babe. Oh boy, a new banana-diet! If you tried to concentrate a little, you might remember something. How could you not remember a thing? When I concentrate I can recall things I did, say... ...last Monday. If you just showed a bit more intention... I'll let you know when I start recollecting things. For now... ...l have a splitting headache. When we get back to the club you'll get some Panadol. What have we here? Interesting coiffure. Who did your hair? Actually... I don't know. Slight of hand with a coin! Do you know any other tricks? Sure, one more. When I'm going to kill somebody I say to him: Heads, you win and I spare your life. Tails, you lose... ...and I'm winning your death. And it's always tails. Attention you shmucks, I have an important announcement. To whom belongs the black Alfa Romeo which is blocking entryway for my wheels? It's my mate's... and mine. Could you do something for me, love? Move your little car away. This I can't do for you. But I can do something else. You see, sir... I could file your declaration, but it's of a low threat to the public interest. How could you allow some shmucks to beat you up like this? You are a city guy. They took me by surprise. Do you have some id? How do you look now? They shaved your head? Eye-witnesses say not only his head. Sir! Did anybody ask you anything? Mister... Jaroslaw Shitface. Sir! Don't you see a period after the 'S'? Well, then please read correctly. Indeed, there's a period after the 'S'. So, it's 'Shitface' without the 'S'? What do you mean 'Hitface'? You told me your name was Keller. I did, I did, I say so many things. Did you really think I could ever change my name to 'Hitface'? Or to have my child carry that name? Just one Panadol or two? - Five! Bon voyage... friend. Here are your pills... Wanna swig? - Sure. I like it. It has that incomparable taste. That boy, remember? ...before I went out to the john, was talking about some wizard... Do you associate this with anything? With 'The land of Oz'. Let us recap. The boy said he had brought the money and claimed to know your bodyguard. He came to collect the wizard. Conclusion? - Maybe he was dim-witted. He was witted enough to nick the case. Any idea who's Volkswagen this is? I haven't seen it before. Exactly. It's been here for a couple of days now. I'm going to take a closer look. Hey, Bolec! I have this weird feeling like constantly seeing this face... The face of the guy who sent me the bullet. It's really... weird. Take a sip. You know, I remember just one thing quite vividly about that evening. Yes... That doll at the dancing pole when I arrived here with Fred. This is for later. I'm up to my ears in this shit. My father should see me now. You need to relax. Easy for you to say- you're not under that kind of pressure. I know the world isn't expecting much from me. My old man is also a great achiever... He is the toilet-pot king. Today, sonny, just like me years ago, look in the well of the past. What do you see in there? - Dung. Yes, this is dung. This is the answer. Since thousands of years every civilization, culture and religion, great war and revolution... ...the most prominent people in the world are always accompanied by dung. Do you understand it now? This is life! You can fool me, your friend or your mommy, but you cannot fool life. That's how I understood... I understood, that I am going to manufacture toilet-pots. And we become the kings of life, my son. I can't fool life: I am the toilet-pot king's son. The latch lays high. Fucking high... In essence, bro: if you don't have to support a family, are not starving... ...or have other matters on your mind... ...it's enough to answer yourself this one fucking, and I mean fucking important question: "What do I like doing in life?" And then start doing it. And have you answered yourself that question? - Smoking joints. Is there a profession associated with that? - Ambassador. On Jamaica, maybe. Not that kind of an ambassador. I meant somebody like Tony Halik. Just imagine how much stuff he had smoked with all those tribes he visited. Somebody has to continue his work. I'm gonna travel around the world as the ambassador to our country. I am Laska.... From Poland. Half of the dough was mine. I had a feeling the job would backfire. I don't have the knack for doing business at all. Ever since I was little I knew God created me for love. Not so in my case. I had to hustle since I was a kid. You know, that evening when you came to the club... When I saw you for the first time... I found you a handsome bloke. You too caught my eye. - Really? I have something for you. For me? Close your eyes. Are you insane? - Please do. Just a little present. A jersey for good luck. Made it myself. Aren't you happy with it? You don't like it... I like it very much. - What is then the matter? This jersey is the very first thing... ...l didn't have to steal. Honey bun, I don't want you to be sad. If you like, I'll tell you a happy story. A while ago we were on a job. Some three boys, without the money as we found out later. Are you listening? Yes. They couldn't pay us, so in the end our pimp grabbed...that... ...scull. Some kind of a wizard... But let me start from the beginning, 'cause those three were something else. A wizard? Where was that? What do you want? I've tracked down the chap who shot you. Where are you wandering about? I was with that girl from the agency. I've also discovered something. Be careful with her. I trust her. Long time ago I also trusted certain woman. I'd even have one of my arms chopped off for her, and you know what?... Now I would be fucking missing one arm... You don't have to lecture me. I think I do. She acts as if she had Jello down her panties, when you are around. Maybe she likes me? Did you fall out of the Christmas tree, Grucha? She's a hooker. She likes men printed on Central Bank notes. Those must be kept on a short leash with a minimum of tenderness... Once she notices she's got control over you- then you have lost, Grucha. The shrew should wear a harness. That's what the polish peasants did until 12-th century... They harnessed their wives and ploughed the land! [Composer's workshop for contemporary music] Regular or reduced? - I am an acquaintance of Piasek. Piasek who? And you, sir? And I carry the Pol-Sat passport. You there, with the pipe. I'm looking for Kuba Brenner. Ask his friends. They're about to finish their presentation. You cannot just walk in there- it's a concert. Hey, mate, I'm looking for Kuba. - Kuba who? Could you stop jangling when I'm talking to you? Don't play like you are looking for something... I'm about to stop being polite. Brenner... Jakub Bren-ner. I would like to send him music scores for consultation. Brenner, here it is. I'll give you his address. I shall remember this. Dad, I just have had enough of these guys. I don't want to schlep along them anymore. No, I don't fit in... Fred doesn't like me. You don't have to like them and they don't have to like you. You just have to fucking control the situation. Hi there, canny-guy. Many people are looking for you. And now you gonna pay for your beer... ...you gonna tip the bartender and we walk nicely out of here. Comprehend? - Yes I do. I'd like to pay... Keep the change. Let me tell you this: It's difficult to find a good child's nurse, but even more difficult a good child. Listen, I ain't gonna tell anything to anybody. I know. That's the reason I brought you here. I was there by accident. Did you fucking heist the case also by accident?! I didn't take no case. You can tell it to the worms... in the dust. Get out. And now what? Now? ... ...you gonna dig yourself a grave. How? With my bare hands? - Aye! You should at least give me a shovel or something. Kinda small, but that's all I have. You are not going to kill me. You're not a murderer! How could you know that? I saw it in your eyes, back then... in the club... But I am going to be. - Why so? My dad asked me to. Can you imagine the pressure of being the mafia-boss' son? I'm 30 years old, but feel like still doing my homework. I must show guts. Maybe I might like to take a stroll in the park, feed the swans... a bun. Or have a romantic candle-light dinner with a girl... ...while playing ballads to her on my guitar. You play a guitar? - Yeah... Don't you fucking change the subject! You see, I can't show any weaknesses. I must be tough and ruthless. I'm just leaving my safe haven and may not disappoint my father. What, have you never dug a grave before? Give it to me. I know what you mean. Don't say you know what I mean, 'cause you know shit. I am a violin player, the son of a world famous conductor. Everybody expected me to become just like him. I always feared the idea of not being able to equal him. But now it doesn't matter anymore... Did I give you permission to change the station? I thought you hated Fogg. - Then you were big fucking mistaking! Mietek Fogg was a nifty dude. "Give me just this Sunday, this last Sunday and may then the world tumble down?. Now this is a song about unfulfilled love. Did you know... ...before the war... ...there were guys in a bar who would request this tune for the band to play. And then at their table... ...they'd blow their brains out. They wanted it to be the last song in their lives. Because it's real. It doesn't speak about: "l saw a shadow of a bird..." or... ...damn... "Anything could happen". What a revelation! That's fucking right: anything could happen! Just like now. So you are a musician? And you like old polish tunes? I have a neat compilation. Come, I'll play it for you. I'm gonna tell everything, but please don't hurt me. - I'm all ears. But I don't know anything. - It's not what I wanted to hear. I really didn't take any case. Open the door. Don't do anything funny or I'll send you a bullet. Any slicks in here? No, there are no slicks in here. - Then give me a fiver. I am a slick, so get the quick fuck out of here. Siwy, we have a slick in here! You give a fiver and the slick here: 30. You must have understood me. In that case we apologize. Next time be a little more polite, please, or you'll get punched in the nose. We are leaving, Siwy. You don't have to start out as a singer: you could do music production.... You'd create music that you like. You must answer yourself one, err... very important question... ...fucking... What do I like to do in life? And then start doing it. I only have to find someone who's going to pay for it. Whatcha laughing about? I'm going to read the papers, watch TV... and if within four years time you don't become a famous violin player... ...then I shall come back and shoot you. I did it! I'm going to France. But not necessary... Kuba, don't do it! Oh no, not this. Don't jump! - Go away! Kuba, don't be foolish, come down immediately. Kuba, come down when the girl is asking you nicely. I don't know her. - What do you mean you don't know me? He's gone mad and doesn't know what he's saying. Kuba, it's me Veronica, your fianc?e. Kuba, you don't want anything to happen to your fianc?e, do you? Excu... Who are you? She's not my fianc?e! She dumped me and has another boyfriend. Kuba, if you love, then come down... ...or else he's going to kill me. Either you come down... ...or she'll never have another boyfriend anymore. I'm counting to three... One, two... Okay! I'm coming down... And what about me? Find yourself a new fianc?. You let him escape? I had him by his nuts when the filth duet turned up. I just don't understand how one can be such an imbecile? Take a look in the mirror: Your face looks like a mashed potato, I can't stand the sight of you, Grucha. Chill out. We gonna get that cash back. I wanna change first and then we're going to the woods... ...to dispatch the guy in the trunk. And then we'll put some pressure on Bolec and his daddy. I have a feeling they're trying to screw us. Near Warsaw, past Brzoski Stare lay post-German bunkers. We can bury him there. You look yourself like a post-German bunker. Oskar, you pinhead, pick it up. Kuba, whazzup? Drop by, buddy, we have great smokes. Listen carefully, my battery is almost dead. - What? Boys, my buddy's in trouble. I overheard them talking. They are taking me to the woods near Warsaw. Close to Brzoski Stare, nigh the bunkers. Inform the police. Okay, buddy, you can count on us. Why the police? We pull him out of that ourselves. Are you listening to me? Grucha, what the fuck is the matter with you? I was pondering. Which turn shall I take? - To the woods. Past 10 minutes we are already driving in the woods. You're losing your nerves. There's nothing wrong with my nerves, but I'm concerned about your head. Is it okay? You are constantly pondering, but you don't look like much of a thinker to me. Maybe there was some arterial disjoining under your dome and you're not associating things anymore. When they were beating your snout to mush, were you then also pondering? Turn... ...right. I am not a doctor, but I know things like this do happen. After the stroke my grandfather turned into a vegetable. There was no contact with him, much like with you. Only grandma had to hold up his flask. We work together and that's why I'm concerned about your insensateness. Would you mind not smoking in my car? I like to have a smoke before an execution. - But not in my car. I don't wish to inhale passively. I'll keep the fag out of the window then. - Everybody's saying that... ... I hear that over and over. For my part you can even keep it in your ass, but not in my car. End of excursion. Get out. Everyday I take in fruit-pulp,sprouts,tofu,garlic capsules. I drink cod liver oil in the morning. I have eliminated cholesterol and animal fats (except of that fish oil in the morning...) Because of all that I don't worry about my longs, heart and kidneys. That's why I don't allow smoking in my car. Smoke is harmful to the complexion and hair-follicles. [Grucha=pear] Is there something? How do you call this look? What is this that you're wearing? This is a jersey. - It's hideous. Enough of this shit-chat. We have work to do. Grucha, it's okay if you don't want to talk about it, but I'm curious... ...what was guiding you when you put on this plebeian jersey. Zip it up, Fred. Fuck, you wouldn't have me my smoke... ...and this was my very last fag. I have a cigarette. Do you want it? - Gimme. Rolled it myself. Tastes strange. Well then... for a safe weekend, Wladziu. For safe. Jeez... Now, Wladziu, shall we go then? Jerzyk, we are supposed to protect and serve this country, so we shouldn't drive drunk. How we gonna get back then? Ease down. Damn, cops. Hide the pipe. Good evening mister driver. You have to help us. Have you selected your jersey from some new fashion catalogue? I got it. As a present. Maybe you just don't realize what you have put on... ...or you know you did something stupid, but refuse to acknowledge that. I don't understand what you are saying, man. If you want to tell me something, then do it in a way I can comprehend. I mean the jersey you are wearing. Have you fucking nicked it from 'Help the flood victims'? Your dog munched it up and then gave it back to you? I would like to know the story of this jersey. When I was in school we got these for practicum courses. Dig, Kuba, dig. Babel, don't sleep. I don't. We just keep on going and it's supposed to be somewhere near Warsaw. Hey, Laska, there are cops following us! Hit the gas, bro. But gently. They are still on us. They must know we have a pipe. Pedal to the metal, we have to lose them. You, Fred, what's your fucking problem with this jersey? Take a look at me. Do you see how I am dressed? Any idea how much this jacket costs? 1500 green-backs. Do you want me to take your picture? - No, Grucha. I bought this costume for occasions like this one. I paid 1500 bucks... ... for my about to be popped buddy to remember well how I looked. To tell fellow angels in heaven, he received the bullet from a guy with class, get it? And you in that jersey of yours look like a clod. You are no different from a Rumanian wiping clean my headlamps... ...when I stop at the traffic lights. When the guy tells in heaven how the one who did him looked like... ...the angels bursting in laughter lose control over their sphincter muscle... ... and cause rain of shit to fall upon us. You tell funny stories. For you it doesn't matter, for on that little jersey of yours nobody would notice any difference... ...but think of me... Amusing... very amusing. From smoking that shit your laughter sounds like a coughing pig. Finished? Then pay attention. I'm gonna give you your last chance. See this coin? I'm gonna toss it up now. If this results in heads, then you win and I'm sparing your life. If it's tails, then you lose and I win your death. Maybe this jersey is plebeian, but that's how it is supposed to be. Unlike you, I don't give a damn about what the guy, who I'm going to pop is thinking of me. I also don't think it fucking has any relevance to pop somebody with or without class. And besides: I don't believe in angels, re-i-ncarnation... ...underwater civilizations... ...or Santa Claus. But I do know one thing: ...every guy when shot at from a few centimeter distance... ...could smirch up your 3000 bucks jacket. And this jersey's story you wouldn't comprehend. It can't go any faster. Quite a predicament, Wladziu. What the hell! What is this? Hands up! Police! I've invited you to this very exclusive restaurant, 'cause I want to tell you something important. I know how much you've done for me and want you to know I appreciate that. But in life things don't always go as we've planned. Not all stories have happy endings. With you I have matured and understood I can't remain a child. At some point one has to leave one's sandbox. That's why I have to leave. Simply said: I have matured... ...and discerned the line between playing and adulthood. I've learned the meaning of the word which neither Laska nor Kuba will ever comprehend. That word is: Responsibility. And when I tell you I'm pregnant with you? - Pregnant, with me? I believe you were saying something about aspiring reproduction. You are in control of the situation, sonny. Bravo, bravo... My flesh and bone. Dad... - You don't have to say anything... ...your acts speak for themselves. I underestimated you, but now it's all going to change. You become my right hand. No more floozies. You get to do... what's really interesting: Protection money, drugs, extortions. You get to taste the gangster's life. But dad, I don't want to! I've had enough of being a gangster. I am not a tough guy. What are you telling me? Is your head aching? Dad... such a lifestyle doesn't suit me. I want to do what I really like. You wanted me to leave the safe haven, so I am leaving. And exactly what is it that you are planning to do? Music production. I have some cash to kick things off. I've decided to start an independent label. Why don't you fucking start growing silk worms? You know nothing of music. For three years now I'm watching MTV on a daily basis. For starters this should do. I don't know if I'll be successful and reach the charts, but my decision stands. Try to understand me. Silnoreki... Dip into that music industry and find out if there's money to be made. If so... ...then we're entering that business. We have to leave now for the opera. - Let's go. And if Bolec releases something, then make sure it's going to reach No.1 in the charts. I think people have to decide that. Then find out who those people are and go talk to them your way. "You look good?. "Easy now... The boys are digging a tunnel?" "l miss you?. "l miss you too?. "l love you?. "l love you too?. France is a beautiful country. Wine, women... I'd like to go myself. Don't have to complain, though, Milan is also beautiful. What is the matter, Kuba, where is that happy face? Mister rector, you know of my problems with dean Zajaczek. He wants to destroy me. Nice, huh? Very nice. In the old days, together with your father, we would chase after such girls... I remember, that every time we'd take Zajaczek along we'd never have any success. Could you help me? I don't know if this would be possible. Dean Zajaczek fell victim to a kind of an accident. The news about your success surprised him in Chicago, while on family visit. He got very enraged and in fury kicked the car of some boy from the ghetto. And then? Like they say... they went medieval on his ass. Good evening, Kuba. Rudolf, we have to run. Bye. Good luck. We'll keep our fingers crossed for you. Did you tell your parents? I'm working on it. For now they only know I've met a young geography student. And when they find out the truth? Don't give a shit about it. Lilly is truly a great girl. At least I wouldn't have to bore my child with stories about how daddy met mommy... ...in high school or at work. "You see, kiddo, your father really pulled one off..." That's what it's all about. One has to collect intense sensations. Hey, gentlemen, wake up! I think we're there. Well... I have a feeling we're close. You know what? I'm going to check out pass that hill. And... any bunkers? No, no bunkers... ...but still, it's fucking awesome... subtitles by kaszanka
