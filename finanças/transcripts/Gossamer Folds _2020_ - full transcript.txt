[wheel creaking] [bright, moody music] [music continues] [moody music] Come on! I'm not a 3-year-old! No, I got it. What do you think, Tate? "Amityville Horror." [chuckles] Okay. All right. Look, I know it's an old shit box, but your mama really likes it, and we're doing what makes her happy right now. Okay? - Where am I sleeping anyway? - Upstairs. Want to go check it out? You get first pick. You can choose any room you want. [music continues] TATE: This pizza's so good. You going to be okay back there all by yourself? FRANNIE: Okay. I'm sorry. I thought you just might be a little scared not being across the hall from us anymore. - I'm 10. - I know. Mom. Dad. Yeah, buddy? Can you tuck me in just for tonight? I got ya. All right. Giddyap. - Thanks, Dad. - Any time. Da-dump, da-dump, da-dump, da-dump. You're hitting yourself. Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Why you hitting yourself? Time to go to sleep. Handshake. Aw... - Come on. - Okay. You got a rocket ship. - Yeah! - There you go. Oh, you beat me. All right. Love you, bud. - Good night, Dad. - Good night. Sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs bite. [chiming] Oh, yes! Oh! Come on. Come on. Come on. I'm so close. Just get it. I've been trying to finish this game for 5 years. FRANNIE: Make yourself useful, Tate. Dump by the back steps please. [woman humming] [humming] Late night, huh? FRANNIE: Tate! RADIO: A government spokesman has stated that there is not... Isn't there some sort of day camp or... - No. - YMCA? We missed the sign-up deadlines. You have to take him with you. Frannie, you're not listening to me. I cannot take him to work with me, okay? He has to go to work with you. Why didn't you figure out this before now? Why didn't you? Hey, I can just go to Brandon's. Oh. No, baby. They're on vacation in the Ozarks. Why can't he go to the office? For Christ's sake, Frannie, he'll be less visible and intrusive at your job than mine. She just gave me a week off for the move. I can't just show up with him. Hey, I'll just stay here by myself. - No! - No! I'm responsible. Fine. Tate, you'll come to Bliss with me. Can't let your father give the illusion at the office he's a family man. - Get your backpack. - Okay. [light piano music] [woman laughs, voices chatter] WOMAN: Perfect. Oh... FRANNIE: Wait. FRANNIE: There's something missing. Ohh! Oh, my gosh. Look at that. Oh, Mommy. I'll give you ladies a minute. Thank you so much, ladies, and please let me know if there's anything you need, even up to the minute you're walking down the aisle. This is my home number. - Oh, good. - Aw, Frannie. - This is great. - I am simply elated. BRIDE: I can't thank you enough. WOMAN: We're just so happy. WOMAN: Thank you so much. I just... FRANNIE: I'm elated for you. BRIDE: Thanks. FRANNIE: You're so welcome. TATE: "Elated, verb. To elevate the spirits up, excited, exhilarated, inspired. Antonym, depressed." Mom, can we go now? You're not wearing your grubby sneakers in there, are you? No. Now, for the hundredth time, can we go? Oh, you little turd. You had your shoes on in there again! TATE: Oh! My socks are dirtier! - All finished? - Oh, yes, Phyllis. It went very well. - Sales? Just over 2,800. Oh, that's good. They were happy then. Oh, they were just elated. Very satisfied. So how's the new house? It's depressing. We love it. And thank you again for giving me last week off so I could get us settled. Well, see you in the morning, Phyllis. - Both of you? - Don't worry. He'll be with his dad tomorrow. - Good. - Good night. Shit! [energetic music] Why are people waving at us? We live in a small town now, Tater. That's what people do in small towns. They wave. It's called hospitality. It means... Don't! I want to look it up. Give it time, baby. It's only been a week. These small town kids are super friendly. You're going to be grateful for that hospitality when you start your new school in the fall. Yeah, it's right above hospitalized. ♪ I step across the road to where a little girl is crying ♪ (Music slowly fades) - Hey, George. - Hey. - George, your hair looks great. - Thanks, Jimbo. BILLY: George? Stop. See? BILLY: What a goddamn fruit. TATE: Hey, Dad. Hey, buddy. Frances, did you see this? You get a load of that faggot on a bike? All right. I'll see you later. I mean, Jesus Christ. Next door to a tranny. Frances, did you know about this? The real estate agent said the house was owned by a retired English professor. [car horn honks] GEORGE: Hey. FRIEND: Hey, girl. - Tate, kitchen now, baby. - But why? - Watch TV. - [moans] Oh. [upbeat music plays] That's wonderful, Frances. You found us a house next to another John Wayne Gacy. Gacy was a clown, not a tranny. Well, I bet this one has got little kids' bodies buried in the crawlspace over there! You stop it! You're going to scare Tate. Well, Jesus, I'm scared. Don't unpack anymore. We're not living here. Because of a neighbor? We're not moving again. Hey, we can move back to the city. That's always an option. BOTH: No. TATE: Oh. [TV plays in background] Look. You know, I packed up. I left the city no questions asked, for you, Fran. Now, if we are going to give this another shot, then I cannot be worried about Tate's safety or what he's being exposed to. Billy, I'm exhausted, and I can't take off any more time from work. I know. You don't have to lift a finger, okay? No, no. No, no. I will rehire the movers. I will repack what has been unpacked, and I'll find us another house. Okay? I'm serious. A great house with great neighbors. - Out of the city? - Yeah, out of the city. And while I'm doing that, all you have to do is just keep Tate away from that deviant across the driveway. All right?

The heartland? Girl, you are crazy. That was very clever. - Hello, Edward. - Hi, Diana. Can I help you, Daddy? George, Aunt Rita called and left another message regarding your cousin Brenda's prom dress. Okay, Daddy.

You been recruited by the Royals? - No, the Cubs. - Eh. The Cubs suck this year. You might have a shot. - So... - You need a haircut, boy. My dad's going to give me a summer cut. What's that? He buzzes it with the clippers every summer. His dad used to do it to him when he was a kid. - Mm. That's the Welfare Cut. - What's that? It's the cut all the kids on welfare get. Okay. - What? You looking up welfare? - Yep. Mm-kay. So what's it say? "Noun, well-being, happiness, wealth and prosperity." Nah, that's the wrong definition, baby. Okay. "Financial support given by a government to the unemployed, - disadvantaged." - Bingo. - Poor people. - Wait, so you're telling me that poor people have summer cuts? Food stamps don't work in salons, Tate. Believe it or not, I went to beauty school. - I believe you. - Yeah?

We can't keep talking about this, okay? - This is exactly why... - Don't blame me! [humming] Well, look who's back. I was wondering if your offer was still available. - What offer was that? - I'm hungry, and I'd like to have some of your corn, please. Lucky for you, I have half a dozen heads already in a pot on the stove. You could just continue shucking these remaining ears. - I don't know how to shuck. - Well, sit down, and I'll show you. Grab it here at the top of the ear. And pull down on the husk. There you go. Yes. That's what shucking is. There you go. You got it. Yeah. Wring it a little bit at the bottom. You got it. Now put it right there. So good. - What style? - Salty style. [laughing] And then you do it over and over again. I'm getting full already. - Are you? - Yeah. - This was so good. - Oh, my God. It was the best. It's a pleasure, a pleasure. This is ridiculous! [car engine starts] [tires screech] Did your wife leave you? No, Tate. I'm a widower. Do you know what that is? How did she die? Cancer, nearly 7 years ago. - Everyone dies of cancer. - Well, it seems that way sometimes, doesn't it? [soft music] He'll stay out of the way. I had no other option.

Are we on welfare? - What? - Mom! FRANNIE: Hello. Oh, of course. The Rivieras. Absolutely. I am all set for the appointment. [singers vocalizing softly] [light, airy music] Do you ever wish you had brothers or sisters? Oh, I have siblings. - You do? - Mm-hmm. Brother and a sister. I'm the baby. Can't you tell? - No. - They moved away, have their own lives, their own families, their own opinions. - Don't they come and visit you? - Me? No. They'll occasionally come to see Daddy. - Don't they like you? - Mm. Tater, some people... I'm not for all palates. I'm more of an acquired taste. You get me? Not really. [soft, airy music continues] Do you miss your mom? The love of a mother is the veil of a softer light between the heart and the Heavenly Father. My mother accepted and loved me for who I was before I even had the words to ask her to. [both giggling] Hey, Mom! I caught 16 lightning bugs, but I let them all go because if they lose their light, they die. Good. I need you to go to bed now. Are we moving again? I don't know what we're doing. Please go to bed. Where's Dad? Mom, is he coming back? Why do you constantly make me repeat myself? Just for once, do what I ask. Go. Go! [rooster crows] - Afternoon, Mr. Edward. - Afternoon, Mrs. Maybelle. - Is Gossamer home? - No, he isn't, Mrs. Maybelle. George is over at Jimbo's trailer. Apparently, he wrecked his bike last night, and he's pretty banged up. Oh, gracious. He may be coming to stay with us for a while. Well, I hope Jimbo will be all right. - Mm-hmm. - Gossamer has always been such a caring young woman. Anything else I can help you with? Would you mind giving this elastic to Gossamer for me? I want her to use it on the seersucker skirt she's working on. Yeah. I'll put it on his workstation with a note on it. - All right, then. Goodbye. - Mrs. Maybelle, - I'll be glad to carry that bag the rest of the way for you. - No! Thank you, Mr. Edward. You don't seem to know a strong woman when you see one. "A bundle of sticks or twigs or branches, especially used for as fuel." [car door closes] [soft, moody music] Sticks and twigs. Morning. Eggs and bacon for my boy. Where's Dad? He'll be back soon, Tate. He's mad at me, not you. Okay? Wait. Do I still have to go to work with you? - Tate! - No! No! I don't like that place. I refuse, Mom. That place is tortuous, and Phyllis is evil. I know. I know. But I called Brandon's mother and arranged for you to spend all day tomorrow with Brandon while I'm at work. - What about today? - I'm sorry, Tate. I need you to do this today. Oh, Mom! [phone rings] [ringing] [muttering] Wish you'd get fired. Hello? Oh, good morning, Phyllis. We were just on our way out the door. No. Billy is actually not around today after all. No. I understand. I'll figure something out, and I'll see you at 9. No, I promise. I won't be late. My favorite neighbors. Hi. Gossamer, right? - That's right. - Is Edward home? Yeah. Yeah. Come in. [soft jazz playing] Mrs. Milliken, everything all right? Mr. Bryant, I know you don't know us... me. I haven't made the effort to be as neighborly as I... The thing is, I work in the city, and Tate's dad is unavailable, and I know it's a great deal to ask. Excuse me. Miss Frannie, how would Tate like to hang out with us for the day? We have no other plans other than looking after Jimbo. I'll be back by 6. He's in capable hands. I raised three children myself. That's right, and we've all become upstanding individuals, particularly myself. Tomorrow, you get to go to Brandon's. Come on, Tate. Let's go make Jimbo breakfast. Thank you, Edward. And I'm so sorry. I know I haven't... I mean we haven't... It's all right, Mrs. Milliken. I understand. Frannie. Thank you. Here is my work number in case there's a problem. Oh, we'll be fine, and don't worry. I won't let them paint his fingernails. [both chuckle] [cheerful music] [song in foreign language playing] - I love it! - Of course you do. Welcome to my hideout. Come in. I don't want to ruin anything. Son, I wouldn't be able to tell if you ruined everything. Come in. Take a look around if you'd like. [rhythmic clicking] Whoa. So what do you do in this place? I'm writing a book of sorts. Actually, I'm assembling a compilation of several of my short stories for publication. Hmm. [soft, stirring music] Is that Gossamer's mom? [chuckles] The love of my life, and that's our wedding day. - Is that Gossamer? - No, son. That's my daughter, Celia. Then where's Gossamer? - She looks like a boy. - Well, I suppose you're right. It's that welfare haircut, Tate. Did Daddy show you his dictionary? - What? - [chuckling] It's a bit decrepit, I'm afraid. Tate, look up decrepit. I already know what that means. Is this a first edition? No. Publication 1864. The first edition was published in 1806. This was actually its third publication. Dorks. Mm-hmm. [tearfully] And I suppose she's going to have it. Okay. And what are you going to do? I know that I know the answer, but I want to hear you say it. Stop being a Goddamn coward and tell me that you're leaving! [clears throat] There. Now find the guts to tell your son. Frannie, I need to talk to you. Listen, I've tried to be really understanding about your situation, but today I found this. It's actually the second one that I've found where you rang her up for $149.63 instead of $1,496.30. Shit. I am sorry. Take it out of my pay. No! This shop is all I have. It was my mother's dream, and she handed it down to me. I didn't lose it to my second husband. I'm certainly not going to lose it to you. I am asking you to get your things, and I will cut you your last check. [moody music] So what did your little eyes spy? Hmm. That's a French [French word] lucky button. - Is it really lucky? - Has been for me. Hmm. You may have it if you like. - It's okay. - Look, I only have one, so I'll never be able to use it again. It's my gift to you, so you'll always remember me. Hey, Georgie gives me stuff all the time. She's even making me this jacket. She's not going to charge me nothing for it. Hmm. Wait. Who's Georgie?

[soft, emotional music] ["Fur Elise" being played on piano] You know what? I bet he's got another woman over there. Now, that's exceedingly speculative. They've just moved out here. Why would they rent a house out here? Because he's got someone in the city and Frannie's trying to keep him away from her geographically. You've been watching too many afternoon drama programs on the television. Okay, but mark my words, Daddy. He's been double dipping. Maybe he has a drinking problem. Maybe that's your problem.

F-A-G-G-O-T. You found one I don't know. What's the dictionary say? Never mind. How about gambit? - Tate. - What is gambit? Tate, it's okay to ask. What does it mean? A faggot is a cruel name for a person who likes someone who's the same sex they are, like if a boy likes or loves another boy as more than just a friend. Like if a boy wanted to kiss another boy? Yes. Well, why isn't it in the dictionary? Bad words aren't in the dictionary, and we should never use it. Any other questions? Can we have Gossamer and Edward over for dinner? Yes, and Jimbo? Yes, definitely Jimbo. Well, that's going to be fun. Gooseberry. Gooseberry? It's a berry. It's a little berry. It's a poisonous berry. [cheerful music] [doorbell rings] - Hey. - Hello. [laughter] Did she bring you her tuna noodle casserole? - What is in that? - She won't tell. It's her secret recipe. Daddy thinks it's shoe polish. I said it tastes like shoe polish. Well, either way, it was so chewy we couldn't eat it, and it clogged up the disposal. Man, she's been bringing those things to us for years ever since Mama died. And we don't have the heart to ask her to stop, though God knows we've hinted. And hinted and hinted. I like the tuna noodle casserole. - No! - Ew. - It cleans out my bowels. - Shoe polish. Oh, Tater, it's 10:30, way past bedtime. Oh, no. School starts next week. We've got to get you on schedule. But I'm not tired. Well, this old man certainly is. We should get going. Say good night, go brush your teeth, and I'll be upstairs in a sec. - Okay. Good night. - Good night. Wait, can Gossamer tuck me in? If she wants to. - Race you upstairs. - Oh, you're on. Bet I'll beat you! Last one up is a rotten egg. - I ain't no rotten egg. - We needed this. So did we. Thank you. So did I. [both chuckle] [electronic pop music] [knocking on door] GOSSAMER: Oh!

Tater? - [gasps] - Where's Tate? - Get out. - Where the hell is he? How dare you break in here. "Break in." My name is on the lease, Frannie. I've been calling here umpteen times a day for weeks now. Oh, yes, we have been so impressed with your dialing skills. Your concern is so Goddamn apparent. - Yeah, well, I am concerned. - Oh, bullshit. You left us. We're splitting up, Frannie. That's what happens. Somebody leaves. Jesus, you don't just stick around treading in the waters of misery. Oh, well, that's so easy for you to say. You're already swimming in another fucking pool. Oh, you seem to forget, Miss Holier Than Thou, that I'm not the only bad guy here, okay? You cheated on me first, you, Frances. That was a long time ago before Tate, and you know it. It was just your misfortune that he didn't love you back. You asshole. You'd be doing the exact same thing that I'm doing. If he had snapped his fingers, you would have left me in a second. You would have been long gone, and you know it. Where's Tate, Frances? He's fine. He's at a new friend's house. Now get out. Slow down, Tate. Got to watch yourself. Oh. GOSSAMER: Hey, you got your bag? Tate. Hey, buddy. What are you doing, Tate? Are you listening to me? Come here. Get over here. Come on. I'll go with you. Get over here. Come over here. God, Tate, don't act so happy to see me. I missed you, buddy. What in the hell is that? We haven't met, Mr. Milliken. I'm Edward Bryant. We haven't? I thought maybe when we moved in... No, we did not. Well, now we have. - Are you going to leave again? - No. Hey. Come here. I came here to spend some time with you. Okay, buddy? Do you want to go to the ballpark? We can practice a few grounders. We can get a couple of root beer floats at A&W. How does that sound? Come on, Tater. I haven't seen you in weeks. Let's just get out of here just for a little bit, just us guys. We should probably consult Mrs. Milliken before you take Tate anywhere. - Mister, uh... - Bryant. Yeah, that's right, Mr. Bryant. Thank you for taking an interest in my son. These past few weeks have found him in your care for more than what is acceptable. I found it perfectly acceptable to assist Mrs. Milliken in Tate's care, Mr. Milliken. That's nice of you, but... your help is no longer needed. I'm back now, so if you wouldn't mind leaving me and my son alone. Mr. Milliken, let me be clear. I will not allow you to remove Tate from the premises until I hear directly from Mrs. Milliken that you have her permission. Listen, neighbor, contrary to what you've probably heard about me, I'm not a bad guy. Frances, she isn't innocent in all this. I'm neither judge nor jury, Mr. Milliken. My sole concern is Tate's well being. Red rover, red rover, we thought we'd come over. Well, perhaps if you had that kind of concern for your own son, you wouldn't have this freak on your hands. - Sticks and stones, little man. - I know what you are. And I know what you are. Faggot, don't think I won't lay you out just 'cause you're wearing a dress. Yeah, well, this is my ass-kicking dress. Stop! Just stop. What's going on? Billy? Just trying to take my son to the ballpark, trying to give him some father-and-son time. - I don't want to go. - Then you don't have to. Go inside. I suppose we should depart now. Thank you, Edward. - I apologize if we intruded. - I don't. You can't just keep him from me. I won't. Let's just see how interested you are in Tate when your new baby comes. This is a nice family you put together, Frances. Ha. Court should be interesting. Hey, babe. Oh, honey. [soft, emotional music] [sobbing] Aah!

I'm sorry, Edward. Where's Gossamer? I don't know, Tate, missing. That's why the police are here. Well, did you look? We can all go help look for her. I must get back to the officers now. Of course. Mom, we just have to look in all of her favorite places. Tate, police will find her. We just have to wait. They'll find her, baby. Come on. Come on. [whimsical music] [whimsical, uplifting vocalization] Thank you. How are you doing? Coping, I suppose. How's Tate? Confused, heartbroken. Well, we both are. Edward, can I do anything? Is there anything that we can do to... No, no, but I thank you for wanting to. First couple of days, I hoped he'd run off to New York City. George has dreamed of working there since he was 10 years old. But to just, you know... jump up and go and not say goodbye... He wouldn't do that. He wouldn't just leave me. He'd say something. George always had something to say. - Her real name is George. - Yes. George. [soft laugh] George. He's my child. I haven't always accepted him. I was always too hard on him, too hard, and now he's gone. She is gone. Gossamer is gone. Oh, Gossamer, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. [Tate counting under breath] Eight. Well done. Go on, get out of here. Can you help me? Thanks, Mom. - Mm-hmm. - Bye. Bye, baby. I miss her. I miss her too, more than I have words to tell you. Edward... Can I ask you something? Gossamer was born a boy, wasn't she? Yes, Tate, she was. How come she wanted to be a girl? I think she thought she made a better girl than she did a boy. It was more natural for her. Oh. Well, that's okay. Yeah, that's okay. Do you think Gossamer will ever come back? I'm not sure, Tate. But this came in the mail for you today.
