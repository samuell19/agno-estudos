The bag! Hello Luna. Hi. It says here I have two parcels. Wrapped like this? Come on Luna, I have to be home for dinner. Sorry, it's just... nevermind! I'll fix them. Thanks. Hi. Who are you? What have you done to me? Untie me! Let me go, bitch! Easy... or the stitches will pop. What have you done to me? I'm burning up! You were hurt and I cured you. I used a disinfectant to sterilize the surgical instruments. Jusus Christ! That's the best I had but I think it'll be ok. Your leg was hurt pretty bad, you had a big wound. You could have bled to death and I saved you. You have a fever, it's the infection... save the energy, your body is fighting! Fuck! Where are you going? Where are you going? Help me! Help me!!! Bitch!!! Here... eat... you have to recover. It smells bad here. What do you want from me? I've got an idea... You already reported me? Come on... last bite. Then you'll take the antibiotics. No, you didn't report me. You wouldn't keep her body in your house. Stop talking Antonio, you're wasting energies. What'd you call me? Antonio... it's writtend on you ID. My name's Tony, there is no fucking Antonio. Oh well, sure, Tony's short for Antonio. I'm Luna by the way. You don't have to be ashamed, Antonio is... I'm Tony! Do you understand, bitch? Don't you dare again! Got it??? Never! Bitch! Fuck you! This is going bad... we should get rid of her. See, it wasn't me that smelled! She should be... cut into pieces! Yes... little pieces to be brought far from here, if you don't want the police to catch us. No, no... you will never cut a body into pieces with that. You're not strong enough. Are you an expert? How many people have you killed? You don't know what you're talking about. Her? Why'd you kill her? Untie me and I'll explain. Did you abuse her? Untie me and I'll explain. Yes, you did. I'm sure of it. Untie me! Untie me! Help me. My leg, it hurts, help me get up. Nature's incredible. The flies have already found a hole in her body. Nothing dies, everything creates life. Luna, help me! Help me! Did you rape her? Yes. Why? No reason! I just wanted to! Help me... Do not do it again! Understand? Never again! I won't help you again! I won't save you again! I'm not curing you any more! Now you just stay here. Now... now stay here and think. Yes, you have to reflect a little. Yes! Didn't you want her? She's all yours! "The person you are calling is unavailable" Postal Go - I'm Marco, call me! Hey! Hey! Come here! Help me! Please! Come here! Help me! My leg burns. You see? I behaved! Please. I have to pee. You can. Please... I don't trust you. Please. Your leg is gonna get infected. You could bleed to death, you know? Your life depends on me. If I cure you, you may have some chances. Maybe... If you have the fever, it'll go up tonight! I'm thristy! I'm thristy! I'm thristy! Give me something to drink, please! I'm thristy! Some water... water... Please give me something... I'm burning up! Something to lower the temperature! An aspirin! My head's exploding! Please. Stop! Stop! Stooop! Let me go! Nothing dies, everything creates life. Nothing dies, everything creates life. Goodmorning, I was waiting for you. I see you're better now. I'm glad. You need to eat, though. Sit, I'm gonna serve you some lunch. I'm gonna kill you now. It seems stupid. You need me. You tortured me, bitch. No, I defended myself. And I cured you. Temperature's still high. Wait, I'll give you something. Stay there! Stay. Good. Now eat your steak. You need proteins. Why are you doing this? Can we talk at dinner, like civil people? What'd you put in the meat? What? Do you think I'm a total jerk? You really think I poisoned it? Now you either wait for the poison to make its effect on me or you eat. What do you want from me? You're my light. When I found you I knew that all my fears would have disappeared. Meaning? It's the life into death, Tony! You know what killing means! You... you have the power to keep life hanging by a thread and I want to be your witness. How do you know I'm not gonna kill you as soon as I'll finish this fucking steak! Tony I'm on your side. You can't do shit for me! Oh, yes! I can cure your leg, for example. I don't think it's good for you to go to the hospital looking like this. They're gonna have questions... You're safe here. By the way, if I ever were to be killed by someone I would like you to. What, Clizia? This is the third time calling Luna and her phone is always off! Maybe she's busy... "She's busy"...what does it mean? Do you hear when you speak? She's busy... I know why she's hiding: she doesn't want to sign! But this time she's not getting away this! Come on Luca, get the car! Let's go! What? You heard! Get the car, go! Clizia, calm down! We'll try again and... Clizia! It's a two-hours drive! What if we arrive and Luna's not there? It's a risk not to call! So we'll take the risk! That house needs to be sold. And take the documents she has to sign. They're in the cabinet! This'll burn! Easy... this leg really hurts. Clean your face. Despite being someone who skins animals, you make a good nurse. I'm a doctor. So why a doctor decides to skin animals? It's art. Do you know? My father taught me. And you live here alone? Yes. Your parents? They don't. And do you have a boyfriend? Too many questions. So, is there a boyfriend or not? What about you? Is she your girlfriend? It smells bad here and this time it is you. I know. You made me pee my pants, remember? I have some work clothes in the other room. I'll get them. Wait. Before changing into new clothes let's finish getting these dirty. We have a body to sort out. I want to take some pictures. No. No photos while I cut a body into pieces. Chill... you won't be in the photos. I promise. Why do you want to take pics? Art, Tony. It's life into death. You're out of your mind. You... you're the painter. And she's... the canvas. If the painter lets you photograph the canvas will he have benefits? Oh yes. He will be treated like a king. In this case watch me paint. Luna, help me. Get me the knife. Get me the knife! Yes. Yes. SMS: honey, where are you? You have to sign the deed. Luna, are you there? I'm disappointed, we had a deal. On my way... These were my dad's. Look good on you. Why all these pictures? My father used to say that death is an angel asking for love. Is he dead? Six years ago. And your mom? She died when I was born. So it's just you. Same. I would like to be alone. Hello? Luna I've been calling you all morning. Where were you? Working. Oh, yeah? I was waiting at home like a moron. The deed, Luna! Remember? Why are you wasting my time? Do you understand that I had to switch shifts to leave and now I have to work on weekends? What a bitch! If you want to leave now is the time. Clizia's coming. Who? Clizia. My dad's second wife. Get your stuff and good luck. The body? I'll take care of it. She wants to ruin everything. Oh my God! What's this smell? Luna? Luna? This place is a mess. I brought some new animals today. Ok but this smell! How do you live? It's normal. They'll get treated. You and your bloody beasts! Calm down. Think of all the money we spent, your father and I, so that you could study medicine. My father paid for my studies, not you! Not you! You only waste your time with these stuffed animals! Did you come to fight? No. You know why I'm here. Listen, Luna... you promised you would come to sign the deem. We had a deal, remember? Now please can we go and end this matter? I'll leave tomorrow, you know I have a rough day ahead thanks to you. Let's hurry. Just a sign here and it'll be over. You see sales percentages are equal, aren't they? I'll stay here. What? You too. Hi Clizia. What did you do, Luna? Head burns. Luca Luca, where are you? Shut up. Help, Luca! Stop! What did you do to me? Are you crazy? You don't look good, you know? Untie me! You should have died. Not him. You never loved my father. Untie me, Luna. Luna, please, I beg you... You don't know what you're saying... You still think I cheated on your father. He humiliated me, Luna. He... You know how he treated me. You... you've always been jelous of our relationship. You're raving, Luna! You're out of your mind. Just like your father. Do you know who he was, Luna? Eh? A violent, Luna, a pervert. No, Luna, I didn't betrayed him. I got rid of him! Free, Luna! Free from that monster! Free! And you? You? I know what you did at night in that bedroom, Luna. What do you think? Eh, Luna? You always talk too much. Now... that's better. Yes. I couldn't bear your voice anymore. Yes. These are all daddy's. Do you remember? I believe this was gifted to him by you. Look... I painted this for you. You're burning up! Too much! Leave me, leave me! No, no, no, that's not good. It's nothing. The car... the car! What? His car. What do you want to do? We need to move it. Ok, but wait, wait... I'll give you something for the fever... Come, I'll help you get up. Let's move the car and hide the bodies. We cannot loose control. I never left so many prints before, I swear. Get that moron's car keys. Understand? And move it. We're falling into a shit hole. Now go and find me a shovel. No... you have to rest now... No! Don't worry about me. Go! Do as I say! Got it? This is a slaughterhouse! Go! Go! Find me a shovel! Jusus! Catch him, Tony!
