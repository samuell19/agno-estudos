A long-braided bachelor to marry the old maid! Will he come this spring? Even if you're an ignorant servant, a grown-up girl shouldn't behave like that. Get up right now! You're going to embarrass me. Let's pack our things and go. - Yes, Miss. - Hey, look over there. You seem like sons from noble families. You shouldn't fool around like this. - You, boys! - A girl is scolding us, huh? Why, you! I'm Master Ahn's third-generation only son! - You should know better. - Didn't you know that? Then you must know men and women shouldn't mingle from the age of seven. She's quite pretty. - Quite cute. - Take that hand off her! - Why, you rascals! - Let's run away! I should pick your little wiener and make pickles! I'm going to teach you a lesson. - Bok-sil! - Yes? That's enough. Hands off him. You know whose son he is. Stop being a rascal! - Oh, there is blood... - Little Master! Little Master! Oh, Little Master! Why are you crying, Little Master? I'm sorry. He was being overly playful so my servant girl pushed him off. But she didn't mean to push him that hard. You shouldn't cry in front of ladies. Let's go. Your father is looking for you. Oh, no! You wet your pants. It's because they were teasing me. Well done, sir. Well done. You should go and get changed. - Let's go home. - Yes. I've been heard how smart Master Kang's granddaughter is. But my son is so immature. You're being too modest. We're honored to have a family like yours... ...as our in-law. - Let's have the wedding ceremony in fall. - Sure. I'll send over our son's birth date document on a good date. Father! Little Master! You have to get changed! - Father! - Where are your manners? Man-deuk, say hello to this gentleman. Oh, my goodness. Why is your bottom like this? You eat and pee, too. Don't you, father? How dare! Our great grandfather's lucky grave site must be paying off now. There is no doubt about the prestige of the family, ...but the boy doesn't sound all that great. Don't say that. These days even the most capable ones can't succeed without help from powerful families. To be honest, this is good news for our family. This marriage will bring wealth to our little girl... ...and may be even open the path to success for your husband. The boy's birth date document will come soon. Make sure she behaves properly all the time. What are the seven sins of a wife? Disrespect, infertility, perverseness, ...jealousy, severe illness, gossiping, ...theft are the seven sins. If she disrespects her parents-in-law, ...does not give birth to a son, ...is unfaithful to her husband, ...becomes jealous of his concubine, ...contracts an incurable illness, ...causes trouble by gossip mongering, ...steals things, ...then her husband can kick her out. What are the three duties of a woman? The three duties are... ...before marriage, she must obey her parents... ...after marriage, she must obey her husband... ...after her husband's death, she must follow her children. Always have this silver dagger on you, ...as a symbol of a woman's virtuousness. If you commit the sins or fail the duties we talked about... ...then you must kill yourself to avoid shaming your family. Man-deuk! Man-deuk! Oh, my... What are you so upset about? Aren't you upset at all? I pity the young thing who'll live as a widow but what can we do? The heavens have decided so. Then you'll still send So-yeon to that family? The patrons of the two families made a pact. We can't break that. But if Master Ahn refuses her... They won't do that. No parents want their son to become a lonely ghost with nobody to hold memorial service or offer food. Why would they say no to a virtuous daughter-in-law? I realize that a promise between the patrons are important... ...but we can't have our young girl become a lifeless widow. We haven't even received the boy's birth date document yet. The men have decided so. I don't want to hear any more talk! But, dear... Everyone knows about our marriage with Master Ahn's family. Who would want to marry our girl if we break it off now? Father! Go away! Even an ignorant woman should know... ...that it's better to bring honor to the family... ...as a woman of virtue rather than be pointed at... ...as an unfaithful woman all her life. If you bring this up again, you'll be dispelled from my house! Deceased Husband. Memorial Plaque. At the time, a virtuous widow in the family... ...was awarded with exemption from tax, military service... ...a special title and a memorial gate. The road to success opened up for Master Kang's house. Give it to me. The madam will scold us. - Let me take it. - Stop it. - Give it to me. - Go away. I'll take it. - The madam will scold us. - What is going on? Oh, he is just being... He wants to help me carrying the food tray because I'm getting heavy. What? Heavy? She's with child. It's already been three months. I apologize for the trouble. I want you both to leave. A man shouldn't be in the kitchen. Sit down. I've never said this before... ...but I've heard people praise... ...your good manners and virtue. I'm very pleased to hear such praises. And I know you must be lonely at such a young age. You're too kind. My inadequacies caused his death. In fact, I am embarrassed that I haven't followed him to the grave. We've agreed to let you visit your parents. No, a daughter no longer belongs to her parents once she marries. I'm a widow no less so I shouldn't leave the house. Looking at you, I can see how honorable your family is. It makes me bow my head in respect. Hey, come on. Come over here. I can hear his powerful voice, Father, I'll come out soon. - Let me look. - Who says you can? - Don't say that. - Somebody will see us. Look at his eyes. Just like yours. Look at his nose. Just like yours. - Of course, we made the baby together. - Right. Oh, our baby is so handsome. Please let me see So-yeon before I die. Worrying about her has made me ill in the first place. Why won't the customs of the nobles... ...allow a dying parent to see her own girl? Don't the nobles have parents and children? Who needs nobles like that? Give them to the dogs! Wicked woman. You've lost your mind. Dear... Madam, madam! Your father is coming. - My father? - Yes. Give that to me. Father! Father! - Have you been well? - Yes, what about you? Well, your parents-in-law told me that you are setting a fine example in everything you do. I've heard that mother is ill. Is she all right? Ill? She's busy managing the increasing wealth of our family. I came by today to say hello since she kept nagging me. The in-laws have suggested that I visit home but I declined. Perhaps I can visit home with you today. I just told you that everyone is fine. What if people see you and start false rumors? Such shame! Didn't I teach you it's only right for parents of noble families to regard their daughter as dead when she marries? Don't ever think of coming home. How can you say that to me? Every day is like a year... ...but I've persevered silently like a living corpse. If I have to serve a dead husband whom I've never met... ...why can't I see my living parents? What sins have I committed to live like this? Quiet! What if someone hears you? How can you say such a disrespectful thing? You are the woman of virtue that everyone praises. I've seen you so I'm going back. - Sleep soundly... - Bok-sil! Oh, ma'am! Come to my room and don't let anyone see you. All right. To your parents' house? Yes, I want your husband to take me. I never get out so I don't know the way. You should go with the servants carrying you in a palanquin. It's like you're running away in the middle of the night. I told you I have my reasons. Just do as I say. I'll be waiting at the gazebo on the hill at midnight. - Ask your husband to guide me. - Why... This is for you. - Oh, my goodness. - Just take it. Oh, my... You're leaving us for good, aren't you? I'm going with you wherever you go. I'm not letting you go alone. Inside I'm tainted like a prostitute. I can no longer wear this mask of a virtuous wife and daughter-in-law. I'd be better off becoming a Buddhist nun. Ma'am. You should go now. All right. Sir, you have to stop her. If the madam flees, our family will be in big trouble. Bring some wine and food. Oh, that wine has... The next morning, a woman was found lying on a grave. It was the grave of So-yeon's husband, Man-deuk who died as a boy. The dead woman was So-yeon. But strangely, on her neck was a silver dagger instead of an arrow. A new memorial gate was erected to honor her devotion and death. The seven sins of a wife. In the mountains, you often find stone Buddha statues without noses. This is because of the superstition that... ...drinking the ground powder of the Buddha's nose will give you a son. You're chipping it off? Why, you! You wicked women. Stop right there! I saw you yesterday too! You wicked women! How dare you desecrate Buddha like that! You nasty women! Geez... Snamas amitabha. Avalokite? Vara. The seven sins of a wife that a woman can be expelled for. The worst sin is not giving a son to carry on the family line. Not producing a son is the worst sin that a woman could commit. This woman has been married for ten years. She has tried everything. Famous temples, powerful shamans, miraculous trees and stones. But she was not able to produce a son. Why, you! You fool! Don't you even have a nose? The tonic is almost burned. Remove it from the fire! Oh, you idiot! Why don't you just die! For ten years, the house has reeked of herbs. Put it down. I'm so sick of this. If the tonic was going to the trick, it would've worked already. What's the point of all this? Oh, my miserable life! Dear, you should retire to the guest room. I'm exhausted so I'll sleep here tonight. Please go before mother says something. Don't you have any pride as a woman? Chasing me off to a mistress? I'm no good to you as a woman. I'd be glad, if the mistress can give you a son. I think it's all useless. If it was going to work, I wouldn't have needed so many mistresses. These days, I'm starting to think that... ...it's my fault that we can't have a child. Don't say such a thing. It's all my fault. The more you try to defend me, the more it pains my heart. Now please go. - Ma'am. - Yes? The to... to... - Tonic. - Give it to the other lady. Go on. This is bad. The Kang family line may end here. Then what shall we do? That wife brought bad luck, the family line will end. Then should I kick her out? - It's no use. - Please help us. The baby will not come. The Kang family line will end here. Kick her out at once! We have to do something or we'll never get a grandson. How can you kick out the daughter of a noble family on just a shaman's words? What? You care about her family? What about our family? So it's all right for our family to be ruined? She knows about the seven sins of a wife. So she should've left this house on her own. I've put up with her for ten years. If you don't want our family line to end here... ...then kick her out and find a new wife for our son. - Why... - Mother! She no longer belongs to her parents. If you kick her out, she will die on the street. How can we say that it's all her fault that we can't have a child? Perhaps the fault is with me. How dare you say such a thing? You're going too far to defend her. Will you still defend her even when our family line ends? Oh... Oh, my goodness! Ma'am! Seong-chil! Seong-chil! Seong-chil! Seong-chil! Please help me, boy. Seong-chil, please help me. Seong-chil! Ma'am! Ma'am! Seong-chil, please... Ma'am! Here. Take those. Go somewhere far away. Don't ever come back. Go far away and never come back. Take them and go. Now. Good bye. The tonic pot is still boiling. But the tonic is now for the pregnant madam. I can't believe it. It doesn't matter if it's a boy or a girl. I'm just so glad that you are pregnant. You should go to work. How come your face has been so dark since becoming pregnant? That's not true. I'm not feeling well since I'm quite old to be pregnant. Oh, perhaps you have a grudge in your heart... ...because you've been so mistreated until now. Oh, my goodness! Dear, it's your tonic. - Your father has it made for you. - It's all right. Please have the servants prepare it. It's for my grandchild, so I should do it. Here. Your father-in-law brewed it for you himself. Can you imagine that reserved man brewing tonic for his daughter-in-law? Have it before it gets cold. She wishes she were drinking poison instead. She has made up her mind to drink poison on the day she gives birth. Gosh! I told you not to come back. You have to leave. I caught this for you... I almost died drowning... Hurry up and go! Don't ever come back! Go! What's wrong, darling? Well, its... Isn't that Seong-chil? Why, you! You disappeared without a word. Even if you're an imbecile servant, you can't disappear like that! This is... I caught it for the madam... Why, that boy... He did a worthy thing. I'll forgive him for your sake. Since you came back, I'll forgive you this one time. Then I can stay? Thank you, sir. Thank you. Seong-chil, can you fetch some water? I have to fire up the madam's room. Look at this idiot! He's so devoted to the madam. Oh, the rings! Those are madam's rings! Why, you! Let go! Ma'am! Ma'am! You beast! Why are you beating on Sam-wol? You should just do your work! What happened, Sam-wol? Here... - Madam's rings. - Why! Tell me the truth! That ungrateful fool! Beat him until he speaks. Yes, sir. You bastard! You bastard! Speak now! Just turn him over to the district office. Yes. Mother. I... Why are you out? Dear, don't be shocked. We found out Seong-chil stole your rings. Look. You can never tell with people. Who would've thought an idiot like him could steal things? - Hurry! Take him away! - Yes, sir. Stop right there. He's really a fool. He can't stand up for himself. I gave them to you for catching the rare carp for me. Why did you just stand there instead of saying something? What a terrible fool you are! Here, take them! Please forgive him, Mother. I gave them to him. Oh, I had no idea. Let's go! Oh, Mother! - Oh, Mother. - Just a little bit more. Good. Good. Push! Push! Push! Father. Thank you, Father. Father. Father. Oh... Give me the baby. Here. When should I die? I've been hesitating because I'm still breastfeeding the baby. But I can't take it anymore. Darling, why are you not eating at all? You must eat for the baby's sake. What are your symptoms? Why are you laughing, Dr. Yun? I've been away for a whole year, getting herbs in Beijing. I see you've learned to joke in that time. Once you know there is nothing you can do, a man just has to accept his fate. To be honest, keeping the secret was hard for me too. Keeping the secret? What do you mean? Do you really not know? Last month, we had a huge feast celebrating the birth of my boy. I came to get medicine for my wife who isn't well after the childbirth. Doctor Yun! What's wrong? You're hiding something from me. I'm glad to hear of your long-awaited son. Well... Doctor Yun! Please tell me the truth! Doctor Yun! When you, the long-awaited son was born in the Kang family they fed you all kinds of tonics for your health. When you were about ten, they didn't follow the prescription... ...and fed you too much Bovis Calculus. So you became permanently infertile. Tell me the truth! Darling, please calm down. You must have heard rumors. What? Are you still trying to fool me? Whose child is this? Such words! Don't you feel sorry for the innocent baby? What? Tell me, you wench! I'm infertile! - Dear. - Darling... - Sit down. I'll go. - Whose baby is this? - Tell me! Tell me now! - Darling... Die! Die! Darling, you have to trust me. Please, darling. Oh, my goodness! Darling! Darling! Darling, the baby is... ...a son of the Kang family. Darling! Darling! Darling! Please... Please trust me. Why, you! Oh, dear... How can this be! Dear... - Dear! - Ma'am! - Dear! Dear... - Ma'am! Ma'am! There, there. Forbidden desires in the palace. The palace where the king rules all the people. It is a place filled with tragic stories. There are some 300 women for just one man. The women all have different roles. Ladies who care for his garments and bed. Ladies who oversee the customs. Ladies who sew his garments. Ladies who prepare his medicines. Even ones in charge of discipline and ones that assist him by his side. Only the king has access to these court ladies... ...and they could never leave the palace once they entered. There was only one way. When they died, their bodies were wrapped in straw mats. The gates would then open for the corpse in the dead of the night. The king is retiring for the night. - You may leave. - Yes, your majesty. Of all the court ladies, the hardest job was the one... ...of the Sangchim Court Lady... ...in charge of the king's bed chamber. Come closer. Yes, your majesty. I'm embarrassed. Please blow out the light. Please let go of your hand. What would you have me do? Come closer. And then? Then they went under the sheets and his majesty said breathlessly... ...you are the jewel of all the court ladies. Then Lady Yun said... Then will you summon my parents to court this time? - Then what? - Then his majesty said, That all depends on what you do, twice in row. Then? She said, what would you have me do? He then said, It's perfect as it is, and laughed. His breath became quick again, and Lady Yun said, please turn out the light. Then I heard the curfew lift. Make sure you write every single thing down. Yes. Ma'am, may I make a request? Forgive me for asking, but would you change me to another role? One can never request anything at the palace. You just do as you are told. Oh, dear. What is going on? - What happened? - What's wrong with her? Oh, there is blood. Dear, what did you do? Oh, my goodness! What is going on here? - Ma'am, we have a big problem. - What? Let's see. Ma'am, feel her belly. There is movement. No... Could it be that you are pregnant? If it's a baby, whose is it? If it were the king's, you wouldn't be hiding it like this. We're in big trouble. Court Lady Kim! Court Lady Kim! Court Lady Kim! Do you know about the court lady scandal during King Sejong's reign? This is outrageous! How could this have happened? Master Gwon, the King's son-in-law stole away a court lady named Gomi from the princess's palace and over 100 were arrested for being involved. Some 10 men and women servants were executed. Ma'am, it's all the same for us who wither away longing for the touch of his majesty that may never come. But please pity the baby that is growing in her belly. Her pregnancy is already advanced. If I may say so... ...don't we all envy her condition? Isn't it our secret wish to have a baby... ...no matter whose baby it is? Quiet! We're all doomed to die now. Go back to your rooms. Go now! What is going on here? - Why isn't your light out yet? - Who's the lady that got carried inside? It's nothing. Please leave us. Nothing? - Oh! Isn't that blood? - Blood... It's women's business. Please go your way. But we have to know what happened. I'll tell you if you must know. She's always been frail. Her medicine caused her to discharge blood. - Discharge blood? - Oh, that's horrible. Yeongodang House. Some years ago, the place was closed down after typhoid went around. They said ghosts howled even in broad daylight... ...and kept their distance. Originally it was used to store ice used in the palace. You have to push. Hold on tight and push. Just a little bit more. Hold her tightly. Push a little bit more. There. - Good. - One more time. A little bit more. It's a boy. They could hide her from everyone... ...saying that she was severely ill for awhile. I'm sorry. Let's see our precious Gui-dong. Have it before it gets cold. Who is the father? We can't hide you like this much longer. Shouldn't we find the father and come up with a plan? Who is the boy's father? You must tell us. Why won't you say anything? It's all my fault. If I disappear, you wouldn't have to go through all this. You are deceiving us. Are you worried that the man will be in trouble? I really don't know who he is. So you're really not going to tell us? You don't trust us, huh? You stubborn girl! Do whatever you want then. We're trying to help you. Why won't you tell us? Calm down and eat the food. Give me the baby. Perhaps it was the heavens that bestowed the opportunity. A senior court lady who used to assist the king was on her death bed. I need to talk to you. What? Switch the corpse? The only way a court lady can leave the palace is as a corpse. We can put the mother in the coffin instead and bury the corpse in the cave. Don't you know a court lady's dead body... ...is wrapped in a straw mat not put in a coffin? Not this time. I'm telling you since I heard that they especially allowed her to be carried in a coffin. Even if she leaves the palace like that... - ...someone on the outside must take her. - We must find the father. But she won't talk no matter what. I'll send a word to her brother just in case. Oh... Don't blow out the light. Don't be startled. I'm the guilty man. Oh... Since that night of shame, I tried to forget you convincing myself... ...it was just an impulsive mistake. But I found myself looking for you... ...knowing very well what would happen if they found out. When you disappeared, I thought you'd killed yourself. So I risked my life and went into the court ladies' quarters... ...and followed a suspicious lady to find this place. Here. This is a token of that night. No, please leave. I'm as good as dead. I don't blame anyone. I'll die happily now that you've come for me. Finally... I can die in peace now. If you die, then I will too. We will die together and live together. If we're prepared to risk our lives then there will be a way. If anything, you have to live for the baby's sake. Leave it up to me. We will never part. Not again... Oh, my goodness! - What's wrong? - Oh... - Isn't that a soldier? - Yes. He's found them. We're in big trouble. Hide! - Come over here. - Hurry up. Quickly! Hurry up! Hurry up and hide! Quickly! We're in big trouble. Grab him! Grab his feet! Why, you! Get up now. Be careful. That was close. Hold him up. Hurry. There. There. Push him. - Find some rocks. - Yes. - Hurry up! - Let's take this one. Bring it here quickly. Place there. There. - You must tie it tightly. - Tie it on him tightly. Make sure it doesn't come undone. Let's carry him. No! - What's the matter? - No! - What's wrong? - Let me go! - What's wrong? - It's him! - What did you say? - You have to stop. - Let me go! - What are you saying? Dear! Let me go! - My dear! - Stop it! My dear! No! You can't die even if you want. Now you're truly Gui-dong's mother. Raising Gui-dong is the only thing... ...you can do for the dead man. The next night, the side door of Yogeummun Gate opens, ...and Senior Court Lady's coffin leaves the palace. Stop! Stop the coffin! There is a bizarre rumor going around. A living person is said to be in the coffin instead of a corpse. If you know about the rumor, come forward now. If nobody does and I find that the rumor is true... ...when I open the coffin... ...then I will gouge out the eyes and... ...cut the tongues of everyone for just being here. Fine. Then I'll stab through the coffin. - No! - Ha! - No! - Why, you wicked... Don't defile her dead body just because of some rumor. You can't defile a corpse unless it's high treason. You and I are all living corpses in the palace anyway. Don't disgrace her death. It's too cruel. - It's too cruel! - Get out of my way. No! I've made a mistake. Escort the Senior Lady's dead body out. Hurry up and escort her out. Come on. Let's escort her out. Shin Film 1969
