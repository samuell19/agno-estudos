Owen just texted about getting together tonight to celebrate. Again? Making up for all those years in the law school library. I wanted to redo my resume tonight. Yeah, you totally should, I mean who's gonna hire a summa cum laude loser like you? Grades aren't everything. Amy, when you can measure your single status by the length of your leg hair, it's time to stop sleeping with your law books and live a little. Like that.. Are you saying yes to tonight? - Okay. Fine. - Okay. Good. - Race you to the car? - Okay. Ha! Hey! It's just me. Never grew so big as this year. Trade you for a stick of butter. Chickie, you don't have to trade me. Ooh! Don't you look cute. I never looked that good even when I looked good. Well, looks aren't everything, unless you're a sunflower, of course. Honey, if the world was blind, you'd still impress. Here's your stick of butter. Enjoy the party. You work so hard. - There we go. - Thank you. Please leave a message after the tone. So I guess I have to make an appointment with my daughter just to get a return call these days now that she's a fancy lawyer. Don't forget we have a spa day planned, so call me. It's mama. - Thanks for the butter, baby. - Anytime, Chickie. - Who's making a toast? - Watch and learn. I'm doing it. Excuse me. Excuse me. Thank you. To the greatest class to ever graduate. Which probably would not have been possible without Amy's study guides. And to all the difference we're gonna make in this world. Okay, okay, okay. How about a round of shots for these bad-ass, slightly-unfit, soon-to-be lawyers taking over the world? Hell, yeah, Demetri, taking the bar was easier than taking your CrossFit classes. Wow. Dagger. You know, I didn't see you girls at the gym. We were too busy training our brains. Wow, wow, okay. Well... To-to, to training your brains. Here. - Cheers. - Cheers. Amy, did you not like it? I-I'd be happy to get you something else. I'm, I've just had enough. Thank you so much. - Sure. - I'll drink hers, don't worry. She's had too many. I'll see you tomorrow afternoon. - Okay, it's time to go. - Bye. Do you wanna hang out sometime? Um, no. Chickie, is that you? Why'd you have to say no? 911. What's your emergency? I, I've been raped. So you met five days ago? Um, yeah. Um... So a bunch of us were celebrating. Um, well, some of us just graduated... - From college? - Law school. - Nice. - Congrats. - So was he also a law student? - No, no. He owns a gym that a bunch of the guys I graduated with train at. He was at the bar. He, he bought us some shots. So you knew him. - No. - Were you drinking alcohol? Y... I had some wine, but no shots. Why not? I had enough. I, I said so. Was he offended? N-no. He smiled. But he knew where you lived? He... He was, um, in the taxi with another friend of mine who dropped me off. He asked me out, but I said no. Then what did he say? He smiled, and then... Then? W-when, when he was attacking me he, he was smiling. So this report will be filed and someone from the division will be in touch. - That's it? - For now, yes. But don't you have to, um... - Well, because you knew him. - No, I didn't know him! He means, because you know the identity of the, your rapist, we don't need to do a rape kit is all. - So you'll arrest him, then? - We'll get his statement. You know, innocent until proven guilty. Is there anyone else around who might have seen him come in tonight? No. I live alone. And my neighbor Chickie doesn't hear very well. Um, ma'am, your, um, your ear is bleeding. Here. This... So, um, you'll... So you'll, you'll step up patrol now that he's been in here? We'll put in a request, but unless there's an actual threat... He just raped me. R-right. I meant, again. Home Depot sells security doors. My God! What the hell? Where's the ambulance? Where is the ambulance? That's a three-hour drive. We need to see the extent of the injury to the genital area to complete the rape kit. Like I said, I'm sorry, but our colposcope camera isn't working tonight. You need to go to Lincoln Memorial. You only have a 72-hour window to complete the testing. This is insanely unacceptable. Here's a prescription for any STDs he may have given you. Take the whole course just to be sure. I'm sorry, but that's all we can do for you here. That's fine, Letty. The police officer said I don't need a rape kit. - I just wanna get out of here. - Okay. Amy. Honey, it's okay. You should go home, okay? You've got that big interview in Boston tomorrow. I'll move it. I'm not leaving you. Thank you. Hello. My Lord in heaven, what happened to you? You go bungee jumping or something stupid? I guess I might have to move our facials to another day. Um, I was attacked, mom. What? That did not happen. Who hit you? Lord, not my baby girl's face. I've got to find something to cover up this mess 'cause you can't go out looking like this. Mom, mom, stop. Please. I was raped. Raped? By who? - Did you know him? - I didn't know him. Well, did the police arrest him? They're investigating. Um... I have to go to the prosecutor's office tomorrow 'cause they decide what the charges will be. My poor sweet baby. Are you, are you sure you wanna go through with this court case and all? Everyone will know. What were you wearing? If... if I was a man, would you ask me that question? I don't, I don't know. Sand 2, that's who you are. Macy's sells a concealer that was mixed by the angels. I'm gonna send some over here and it'll arrive before I get back from the Galveston pageant. Wait, you're leaving town? Well, they want me to be a guest judge and I said no, but it's the five-to-eight-year olds. They know I can't resist those precious little princesses. And the money didn't hurt. Sweetie, don't be blue. Come on. By the time I get back, you'll be all healed up, we're gonna have a spa day and have those facials and then we're gonna put all this business behind us. Okay, now, I'm gonna make you a nice cup of coffee. Here, you practice in the mirror 'cause you're gonna need this for the next seven days. The average sentence is 11 years for rape if we get a guilty verdict. Now, we'll meet again as soon as formal charges are officially filed. Okay. So when will that be? There's a huge backlog of rape cases. The court will notify the accused of your intent to file. Now, it could take up to six months for the case to come to trial while we investigate. Six months? Yeah, well, says here you passed the bar with flying colors. You know even he has the right to a fair trial. At this point, unfortunately, it's his word against yours. Hey, there, tattletale. Alone again, I see. Love that. What is that? Chocolate chip? You need to back off talking smack about me. Drop the charges. You know, last time was a romantic walk in the park compared to what we'll do this time. We're soul mates, you and I. I'll see you at home, honey! Do you need a moment? You look white as a ghost. No ....! I'll get this filed right away. Everyone in Boston is so excited right now. I mean, the Red Sox are rocking it! What is going on with you? Why are you still cleaning? - I'm pregnant. - What? How can you be pregnant? I thought the doctor in college said you couldn't get pregnant. All those things you dealt with the cysts? My God. And you had a job during law school, right? You worked for the attorney general? - Yes. - What was your area of focus? Initially it was delivering a still piping-hot venti quadruple shot, but blessedly it transitioned into drafting docs for women's issues, mostly, domestic violence in a department that I-I helped reestablish. Well, if there are no other questions... We can... Okay, really? Because there's a great deal more that I didn't include on my resume. I studied abroad. And, um, my-my dissertation was about international fluid policy change and then I... Will you accept the position? We've been following you since your second year at Emory. We know you're being courted by another firm. We'd ask, instead of you having a second interview with them, you join us. Wow! Yes. Yes! Hey. Anything stopping you from starting on Monday? We've got a civil case pending we could really use you on. Nothing, nothing at all. Count me in. Terrific. Now, this part I like to call the little hurricane. And this here is the eye of it. That is your baby. You are back on track! The universe is pulling for you. And about time. And no one deserves it more than you, especially after all that horrendous-ness. Is that a word? So I have a cousin who got pregnant and didn't want to be and... I wanna keep the baby, Letty. You do? I mean, you've worked so hard, all that school, and now this dream job. You sleep with your law books, Ames. It just... It feels kind of impulsive. I know. I must seem crazy. I'm so furious with myself that I couldn't fight him off. And, and my body just felt broken, dead. And now I'm growing this little life. It's very much a part of me already. But isn't it gonna be a reminder of... Strength. That he took so much from me. And now this baby, I feel like I'm not broken, after all. I have hope now. I've always believed in a woman's right to choose, even my own. I just... I have to keep it. Well, then, congratulations, mama. This is going to be the greatest and hardest thing you'll ever have to do. She says you threatened her in the grocery-store parking lot on Main Street and 5th. Sir, I-I saw her and said hello. You know, to be polite. She's just some woman who flirted with me that night at the bar. And then you dropped her home in a taxi? Yeah, sure. Her and her friend. I live close by, and they were pretty... Well, they were pretty inebriated. So I saw them safely home. And that's the last you saw of 'em? Yes, sir. Sorry I can't tell you more. No, that's great. Thank you. It's a nice badge. Just gonna get some more color added to mine, freshen it up a little bit. Yeah, wife wants me to get rid of it. She's got a bee in her bonnet since she's pregnant. About as far along as Ms. Thompson. Well, you know what they say, babies change everything. My baby girl, look at you! Don't you just look so much better! It's like night and day. You're just positively a-glowing! - How are you, mom? - I am relieved! Alright, now let's have a sip of champagne and celebrate your new job! Hey, mom, um, I'm not gonna drink today, okay? It's okay if we have a little sip in the afternoon. No, it's, um... It-it's because I'm pregnant. You're what? My God, since when did you even have a boyfriend? And when were you gonna introduce me to him? Um... No, I... I got pregnant from the rape. My God. You can't be serious. I'm-I'm keeping it. Now, look. I know that you have always been a head-strong little thing. But a child from that man? Every time you look at it, you're gonna see his face. This baby is the only thing keeping me from the dark place he took me to. Give me an F-in' break. This isn't Super Soul Sunday. This is your damn life! What about... God. What about your career and your future? What-what about your reputation? And what man in his right mind is gonna want a woman with a child born from rape? I'm not thinking about a man right now, mom. You're not thinking. Period. You can't have this kid. Yes, I can. And I will. You are not just destroying your reputation... you're destroying mine, too. I've made my decision. My God. This can't even... I am more than happy to leave this nightmare. Have you thought about the future when people ask who the daddy is? That poor child. Hey, guys, what are you doing here? Owen paid Demetri a little visit. Yeah, and told him what a sick son-of-a-bitch he was. - You went to his gym? - Yes. Look, I hated myself for letting him join us that night, okay? But he said that he didn't touch you and that you have him confused for someone else. And he got real pissed. He could barely keep his... together. - Guys, he's got a scary temper. - And scary lawyers. Yeah. Brown Melway and Wallace. It's gonna be a dirty fight. As if you had a choice. Hey. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. - No. - What? The Boston firm wants a second interview. I have to fly out tonight. Hey, that's great! I can't go. I can't leave you. No, you have to go. Absolutely. Go get 'em, girl. Okay, I'll only be gone for, like, two days. Owen, you'll stay with her, right? - You guys. - Yeah. I'm fine. Really. Seriously. Good luck. I'm good. He is stalking me, Jim. Why is the restraining order hearing taking so long and why isn't he answering to the rape charge first? I'm waiting for a hearing date. It'll come up faster than the rape case. Amy, you're doing great. Just follow the law. What does it matter if I follow the law when he doesn't? Eventually he has to. "Eventually." You know, the truth is, it doesn't matter how many locks I install or how careful I am. There is no legal protection that anyone can seem to offer me. You know that, he knows that. He isn't afraid of anything. If it was one of your daughters... He'd already be dead. So you've been having these cramps at least three times a day? Yeah. Is the baby okay? Perfectly fine. You, however, have a shortening cervix that requires rest. So you'll need to avoid all strenuous activity from here on out. No. I just got a new job. So I can't... Amy, we can't risk a premature birth. There's no choice, I'm afraid. Now, how about we find out the baby's gender so that you can be thinking about names while you're resting? - Okay. - Okay. Sir, like I told the detective, I don't even know her name. The only time I met her was at this bar I hang out at with some friends of hers at law school. How do you know them? I run a gym where they do a 3-D competition. It's CrossFit, boxing and weights. It's a good thing they're smart. Why do you say that? Well, they basically flunked. I mean, they couldn't save a fly, let alone themselves, but I passed them anyway. So you lied? Look, what can I say? I'm a nice guy. Do nice guys have to tell you they're nice guys? So you're saying you couldn't possibly be the father, that you didn't force sex on Amy? Like I told you, I don't even know her. That's sad. Some women get so vindictive when they get rejected. You rejected her? Is that what you did? It's pretty easy to prove paternity. Have at it. I'll only be working from home for a few weeks and I can phone in to all of the meetings. I'm not the only single working mother out there. I know you also said that you... But I wasn't pregnant from a rape, starting a new job straight out of law school. A police detective came here today looking to corroborate this was your place of employment. Why didn't you tell us? It's not relevant to what I do here. It didn't feel like it was an appropriate thing to share. I feel like I have more than delivered... Yes, so far you have, a-and I admire your fortitude, but I'm a little concerned how you're gonna continue to do so with a high-risk pregnancy and a court case ahead. You've nothing to worry about, I can assure you. Now, don't forget to drink plenty of water and get lots of sunlight. You're basically a house plant with more complicated emotions. Are you sure you're okay with this? Yes, yes! Chickie knows to check in, and Owen is standing by... And I'll be home every weekend to look after you. Yeah, um, so I've got this, um, work call in a few minutes. Look at you, taking care of your career! I'm gonna tell them that I'm leaving. I already have a case that I'm forced to prove. I don't wanna have to prove myself to anyone else, especially a board room full of doubters. Ames, this is the best offer from the firm of your dreams. Yeah, dreams change. I'm gonna do some casual PI work for this guy that I know. It'll just be less stressful till the baby is born. You were top of our entire class, and now you're gonna take some low-end thing? - If it were me, I'd keep the... - It's not you, Letty. It's me. Okay. Take pictures in Boston. Lots of them. I love you. The thing about some women, pretty as they are... you can never really trust what they're gonna do next... Shh! Shh! So you get knocked up, and you blame me? It could have been so many others. Why are you acting so crazy? Amy. Amy, Amy. We're both moving on. Understand? I'm telling you this for the last time. Drop all the charges. I go away. No. I told you about using that word. I'll kill it, too, so you'd better listen. - No! - Yeah? Unless you want to make it up to me. Come here. Help! Help! No! Call the, call the police! The hell with them, I'll take him myself! Hey... - You okay? - Yeah. It's gonna be alright. So we've checked your perimeter, and it looks like all of your locks are working. Are you sure you didn't leave anything open? Weren't you guys supposed to be watchin' her? You gotta go a long way to find anyone more useless than you! Hey, have you considered moving? I'm waiting for court dates on both cases and I'm on bed rest, so moving for me right now is not an option. How about you guys do your job and move him into a two-by-four cell? What in hell's takin' so long? I'll make sure that a patrol car keeps an eye on her. And him! He's threatened me with a gun in my own home and now he's still asking me to drop the charges. Okay, look, we work with a few private security companies tha... You know I can't afford that. Okay, how do you feel about arming yourself? No. Not for me. Then remember, we are making some progress. We got the date for the hearing on the restraining order all set. What about the rape case? Amy, out of every 1000 sexual assaults, 995 perps walk free. If we're gonna get this guy, we have to check every box. How many boxes do we have to check before I end up in one? Mom, please leave. I need you to listen to me. Can you please talk to me? I am your momma. Thank you! Lord, it is so unpleasant. It is a girl, mom, and, and her name is Maddy. It isn't too late. Dr. Bird has offered to help. - Even at this point. - What? Who? You remember him, tall drink of water, lived at the big house at the end of the cul-de-sac? So well-respected. Look, I-I am happy to pay for it. Then we don't have to talk about this ever again. Mom, please listen to me when I say this. I am keeping this baby. Can you please just tell me one thing, because I must be missing it myself! Just what are you trying to prove? That I am a mother, mother. It's okay, you'll never make it in time. Don't worry, I remember all the breathing stuff, coach. - And pushing... - Yes. Ames, I love you. I'm-I'm there even though I'm not there, okay? I know you are. I love you, too. - Kick some ass. - You kick some ass. You're gonna be great. Is there anyone else you wanna call before we get this party started? No. Okay, mama, here we go. I will always do my very best for you, my fierce baby girl. Wow. Hey. This is your Aunty Letty. Hey. Could she be more perfect? She's breathing on her own... Gosh, I can't express how much I love her. She's beautiful. Both of you are. Her name is Maddy. Well, Maddy... I got you the best that Boston Airport has to offer. - How are you feelin' today? - Good. You have a little bit of paperwork. It's the birth certificate. Do you wanna put the father's name on it? - No. - No. It's just me. Like I said, Your Honor, I-I just wanted to find out why she was saying those crazy things about me. So why hold it against me for going to see her? "Going to see her?" Your Honor, in addition to battery, he's been relentless in stalking her throughout the city. - He pointed a gun at her. - Objection, Your Honor. The defendant has already testified that he did not have a weapon and never threatened Ms. Thompson. How many times will counsel try to suggest this alternate scenario? Counselor? We have the neighbor's testimony that corroborates Ms. Thompson's. The neighbor testified that she did not see a weapon, nor hear my client threaten Ms. Thompson before she fired a shot at him. Move along, counselor. Your Honor, we have a report... May I approach? From the court's own investigator... that indicates repeated contradictory statements given by the defendant. We have a witness confirming he terrorized Ms. Thompson at her own home to the extent she had to jump out of her window while six months pregnant. Your Honor, is there a question coming for my client here? Or is opposing counsel simply using this time to pontificate? The court finds the defendant guilty of battery threats and witness intimidation. However, the court is willing to grant probation providing the following conditions are met. No contact with Ms. Thompson, and you will meet with a probation officer. Court dismissed. The hurricane warning remains in effect for all the Carolinas and parts of Virginia. Hurricane Arthur, a major and extremely deadly hurricane is expected to make landfall around 9 a.m. tomorrow. This super-storm is expected to be a category-five hurricane with winds up to 300 miles per hour. Hey, are you at the center yet? No, I'm not evacuating. I'm leaving... for good. I'm sorry, am I missing something? Isn't there a hurricane raging outside of your door right now? Yeah, maybe it's telling me something. A sign to get out and go somewhere, anywhere but here. What? What about the rape case? It's taking too long, Letty. I'm scared here. Well, then come to Boston. Stay here with me. - No. I'm gonna go to Atlanta. - Why? Hey, we liked going to school there. Okay? And I need something familiar. Be careful. Look, I'll call you from the road, okay? Alright, bye. Thank you. Wow, Maddy, you have the magic touch. We've sold out three times. It's my secret potion, that's why, mama. - Yeah? So what's in it, again? - It's a secret. Okay. Hey, remember, we don't have secrets. - Yeah, yeah. - Hey... is this stuff really homemade? Did you make it? - I did. - We did. Mama, that hurts. Hey, buddy, you, you want a cup? Here, kid. It's on the house. - Okay? - Thanks. Come on, bud. Drink all my potion. It'll make you big and strong. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Man, that's good. Your preschool is just around the corner, and you'll have some of the same friends, like Logan and Sophia. And I bet there'll be cooler art projects. But if we don't like it, we can do Team Us. - There'll always be Team Us! - Team Us! You okay? You ready to go find your desk? Yeah. - You can go now, mama. - Okay. Excuse me. Which way is administration? Thank you. And I really appreciate her getting into this school. It's such an artistic place. And it feels safe. Yeah, of course. We're happy to have her here. - Is it? - Pardon? I mean, it feels safe... We use every precaution possible a-and we do have a parent safety committee, if that's something you're interested in. Yes, I'm already signed up for that. Well, we have a spotless record when it comes to security at this school. I promise you, you have nothing to worry about. - Okay. Thank you, David. - Of course. Hey, while I have your here, um, Maddy's enrollment forms, you left the father's name blank. Yes, that's correct. Maddy doesn't have a father. I should get to work. Thank you. Sure. Hey, Amy, how was your weekend? I went to the game, then got wasted Saturday night and spent yesterday in recovery. What did you do? Um, Maddy had a birthday party, and then we had a church thing. Actually, today is her first day of school. Fun, fun, fun! So maybe you wanna join us this weekend? We're all going out to this crazy party. It's gonna be awesome. You should really come. I actually, I have this old friend who's coming into town, so... I'm gonna get started on this litigation. Yeah, for sure. And I was in my office alone again, and I looked out at The Boston Opera House and I thought, "What the heck am I doing?" Law was my father's dream. All I ever wanted to do was dance! Wait, so what are you saying? You're gonna dance at the Opera House? No. Um, I'm gonna dance here. - Here? As in Atlanta? - Yes, Atlanta. The guys here are so cute. Plus, you have Costco and... - And Waffle House! - Waffle House. I mean, what else does a girl need? And there's a decent dance studio downtown that I could teach at. Is it cool if I hang here until I find my own place? - What? - Yay! It could be like the old days, but better. And free dance lessons for all! Yes, we can turn the office into your room. Although, spoiler alert, Maddy's never been one to sleep through the night. Well, that makes two of us. She could watch my old movies with me, and I could teach her my horrendous snacking habits. Plus, I think you could use some help. I'm proud of you... and this beautiful life that you've made. And the only reason I'm goin' back to that church is for that great bakery across the street. They sell those cinnamon buns you love. Mama, can I have one? Your choice, 'cause as I remember, it's Sophia's party and someone said there'd be cake. Hey, put that in the sink for me, okay? That must be the paper. - Amy Thompson? - Yes. You've been served. How can he file for custody? He denies brutally raping you. And now all of a sudden he's daddy dearest? Different state. Different court. Mama, what's wrong? Nothing, honey. Everything's fine. Okay, come on, we don't wanna be late... We're gone! Mama. I made copies of what I have. Great. Thanks. Alright. Let's take a look and see what she has here. Yeah. Um... Okay. Yeah, there's a police report. Yup. That's pretty... How can he be entitled to the very same rights as other fathers? Well, in Georgia, there's a belief that a rapist father is better than no father at all. He must have known 'cause he couldn't have filed in North Carolina. We actually had a case a few years ago where the judge ruled that the mother share all the decisions of the household with the rapist father, even religious choice. There's another judge here that believes that a pregnancy from rape occurs with the same frequency as snowfall in Miami. I was raped and I conceived. Right, and that case is still pending and hasn't been tried yet. So he's still innocent in the eyes of the law. This morning, counsel disclosed that he's hiring his own private investigator. - He'll be contacting you. - Private investigator for what? He looks all the more innocent if it appears like he's transparent. Where's he even getting the money to pay for this? Fathers'-rights groups? Family's helping him? It doesn't matter to the court. There's something else that his attorneys are asking for. He wants the child to have his name. No way. But he'll settle for a hyphenate. - Never. Never! - Never say never. As your court date is just a few weeks away, I suggest that you sign with us immediately... If you don't hire a lawyer, the court will assign you one. - I don't think you want that. - Okay, so what's your strategy? Well, the court will look favorably on a small concession, so I say we open the door to once-a-month Sundays with supervised visitation... Thank you. I'll defend myself. Ms. Thompson, you can't do that. This man pointed a gun at me when I was pregnant with my daughter. I will not be compromising her safety and welfare in any way, even if the system thinks it's okay for rapists to tuck kids into bed at night. So what's your strategy? The truth. Yes, hi, my name's Amy Thompson. Can I speak to Professor Berman? Hi, Professor Berman, it's Amy Thompson. Yeah, I have some questions regarding a custody case. Yes, is there any precedence in the state of Georgia for denying custodial rights? So you're saying there's no protection for mothers with children that are the product of rape? But there must be some way. But... I understand, but... Surely you're not saying... Is there someone else I can speak with? I'm workin' on your snack, okay? It's comin'. Double peanut butter, right? - Yeah. Yes, please. - Yes, please. How's your music homework comin' along? I was doing good, but I took a little break. But I did some. Finally found it. Hey, why is she frowning? Well, she's in trouble. Who's in trouble? You, mama. We're gonna learn to karate chop. And you won't be afraid anymore. I'll protect you, mama. All you have to do is sign here. Okay. Hey. - I thought you had work. - I have a friend. He bought himself a team. They look like a bunch of fancy birds on a wire. At least you don't actually have to see that bastard. That's the one good thing he did, have the decency to stay in North Carolina. Hey, you got this. All rise for the honorable Judge Bonner. Please be seated. We're here to establish Mr. Demetri Hogan's paternity. Mr. Hogan, counsel informs me they are representing you for the State of Georgia and you presently live in North Carolina. Is this correct? Yes, Your Honor. I'm the best you'll ever have. And we have Mr. Hogan's counsel Ms. Wallace and Mr. Rosemead, his personal investigator. Ms. Thompson, you're representing yourself? Yes, Your Honor. You know the court does not advise it. I do, Your Honor. I've read petitioners' and respondents' statements. As this hearing is to establish Mr. Hogan's paternal rights, I'll ask his counsel to proceed with any new statements. Mr. Hogan's message has been clear since he hired Mr. Rosemead, who helped him to discover that he fathered a child almost seven years ago. He simply wants an opportunity to be a loving father to the child that he's purposely been kept away from by the mother. Your Honor, that's a lie. Mr. Hogan found out I was pregnant from a detective. I filed a restraining order against him after he raped me in North Carolina. Ms. Wallace was his attorney then, too. Objection, Your Honor. Are you going to allow Ms. Thompson to randomly interject like this? Ms. Thompson, please approach the bench. This is family court, not criminal court. Yes, Your Honor. And are you aware of any law to prohibit this action from the child's father? No, Your Honor, not in the state of Georgia. And no federal law, correct? - No, Your Honor. - In which case... - But I'm working on it. - Well, you'd best hurry. State law is scarce and inconsistent. I'm bound by the law, Ms. Thompson. Laws that keep mothers and children tethered to the rapist? Under the law, I'm compelled to believe both parents capable... unless I'm convinced otherwise. Maybe you'd like to consider getting some help? You may be seated. Before we proceed, I'd like to order a paternity test for Mr. Hogan. Based on that, we will set hearings. Court stands adjourned for the day. Excuse me, I just want to talk to her. He sounded like Darth Vader through that stupid speaker phone. Excuse me, Ms. Thompson. Bob Moss. I was watching the proceedings and I'd like to offer my assistance. Thank you very much, I'm defending myself. Court kind of prefers that you have an attorney. I-I know this judge really well, and I'd do it pro-bono. You know, you just... You can think of me as a... I got 'em here. A hard-working sandbag for you. And, um, for the record, I, I think what you're going through here is, it's appalling. He seems nice. Hello. Afternoon, gentlemen. - Can I help you, sir? - I'm just waiting on someone. If you don't have a child here, you shouldn't be on the property, unless you signed in at the office. Now, there's a protocol in place for all visitors. - It's to keep everyone safe. - Maybe I do have a child here. What's your child's name? You know, I'm not a visitor. I'm a father. I don't have to prove anything to you. It's my right. Notify the cops about this guy. They can't do anything unless he does something. Yeah, do it anyway. You think he's really got a kid here? I wouldn't trust him with one if he does. Junbi! Right foot back, fighting stance, go! Center punch, go! Go! Remember, Chi lives inside us. Chi is the life force that flows through all things. - Can you feel the Chi, class? - Yes, sensei. This guy's the real deal. Our whole family takes a class. Worth every penny for the peace of mind. McDevitt is our Shihan Sensei. Word is, he was one of the best State Troopers back in the day. Remember the practice continues outside of the dojo. Does he ever do private lessons? Sometimes. He's very particular. You have to write a request, old-school style. He decides if you're worthy. The dojo exists because of the meaning we give it! Class, please be seated. That's your daughter? - Yes, yeah, it is. - Cool, good for her. You know, when I was nine, I was on the cover of "Black Belt" magazine. Yeah. So these are, this is the paperwork that you needed for Maddy's school for the judge. Yes. Thank you. Um... I hate to bother you in the middle of family time what not, but, um, we're gonna need another deposition from someone that has any knowledge of your case. Letty and Chickie weren't enough? No, no, no. They're, they're fine. It's just that, you know, the posing attorneys, they're gonna try to discover any inaccuracies in your version of events so that they can, you know, settle this before we even get to court. So is there anybody who can depose? Anybody else we can depose that, you know, knows what happened and-and can approach themselves? You know, it might have been nice to be warned that I was gonna be disposed. - Deposed, mom. - Po-tay-to, po-tah-to. Well, I thought everything was gonna be done over the phone, so... Well, I guess that's not the first thing you've been wrong about, along with that airline knock-off suit. I mean, do you just purposely wear stuff like that so men won't give you a second look? No wonder you're still single. Have I not taught you anything? You've taught me more than you know. Well, don't worry, I'm not stickin' around. As soon as I answer these boring questions, I'm on my way. Thank you for doing this. I appreciate it. I didn't exactly have a choice. I just think this is ridiculous that you have to fight this, this rapist for custody. You should've, you should've never moved to Georgia. Those damn backwoods hillbillies... So how is she? Maddy? She's very sweet. Happy. Does she look anything like him? No, mom. She looks like you. Why, Lord! What a beautiful angel! I would love to meet her. Do you think you could ever change your mind? - Look... - I could... I could help you make some money with her. Well, I was modeling at that age, winnin' pageants, I was puttin' food on the table so my mama didn't have to worry so much. I was glad to help. As much as some might judge my world, I was happy. My daughter is happy. Well... Why don't you treat yourself? Come on. Take it. Both-both of you. Or maybe you could pay some of these court fees, all these added expenses. Didn't I say this was gonna drag on? You've said a lot of things, most of them ignorant and selfish. God, I took it for so long. I'm done. I will never listen to your toxic bull... ever again, and neither will my daughter. That makes me happy. Can I get you some coffee while we're waiting for the defense team to arrive? I'm sure she'll have some. She likes it on the bitter side. Mr. McDevitt. So I had to read your request a few times. You've got yourself a situation and no time to waste. - Yes, sir. - Here's the good news. I'm not a lawyer, judge or a cop anymore. Therefore, I might actually be useful. Now, before we get into the physical, we must examine why someone has waged war against us. Yes. Why after all these years? All about power and control. Just like rape. The answer's simple. - To get back at you, the enemy. - For what? He's what you call a malignant narcissist. It's never their responsibility. 'Cause you filed criminal charges against him, life has fallen apart these past years. And now he's claiming the child as property. Let me ask you. Are you ready to form a counter attack? I'm afraid of my anger imprinting onto my daughter. Fear imprints onto children, too. It's contagious, not to mention that permanent kink in your neck from always lookin' behind you. So what do I do? I'm talking about finding his weakness and creating an opportunity for yourself to win once and for all. Change the rules. That's how you get your mojo teed up in my dojo. Junior Olympic coach. I got nothing. Keep looking. There has got to be something. Here he is with a bunch of dorks at a gun show. Hey, wait. Wait, wait. "Released from duty ten years ago." "Most common subjects of complaint "are unlawful search and seizure, harassment, coercion or sexual threats." Mom! I got scared. Yeah? Did you have a bad dream? A snake was chasing me. Hey, Maddy. Did something happen at school? We were making cards for Parent's Day and Jack ripped mine all up 'cause I don't have a daddy. Gosh, I'm so sorry that happened to you. Jack sounds like he's kind of a bully. You know, your dad was kind of like Jack, like a bully. That's why it's just us. What did he do? Well... I said no to him and, and that made him angry. Just 'cause you said no? Yeah. That's not okay. No. It's not. I'm so sorry that happened to you, mama. But you know what? I prayed that I would feel better, and my prayers got answered because there you were. And that was such a miracle, Maddy, to get to be your mom. But I don't want a bully for a dad. Yeah, me either. Mama, am I the only one? Yeah. You are my one and only. I mean, that has a daddy like that? No, sweetie. Then we have to help them, mama. You are so right, my love. Shihan Sensei said that we're not fragile like a flower, we're fragile like a bomb. Yes, we are. - Love you, mama. - Love you, sweetie. Bye. North Carolina State Police. How may I help you? Yeah. Yeah-yeah. - Love you. - Bye. Hi, I'm trying to determine the status of Officer Demetri Hogan's discharge in 1997 from the Wilmington Police Department. Are you a relative or a legal representative for Mr. Hogan? No, but... Then you're not entitled to that information, miss. Okay, I'm just looking for a corroboration for a pending court case for violence or sexual assault. I'm sorry, I've already told you that I can't disclose that information to you. Okay, but I'm j... Sorry. That will do nicely. Hey, um, I know you were a Trooper back in the day. You think you could get some information for me from law enforcement in Wilmington? Certainly possible. But that's against the rules. We're changing the rules. Our guy's back. The one who says his kid goes here. Yeah. Alright. Add extra security to campus. - For how long? - Indefinitely. Maddy? - Where's Maddy? - She's in art class. They just started cleanin' up. What's wrong? There's a man at the pick-up line. He's following me. - Do not let him into the school. - Is it this man? He's been parked out front claiming he's got a child here. Yes. That... Wait. Why do... - Did he see her? - No, no. She's been in class all day. Who is he? That is Maddy's father, but she doesn't know him. - I thought you said that... - I was assaulted. I got pregnant. He's coming after me for custody. Custody? He-he can't do that. - Yes, he can. - Okay. Alright. Listen, we've already notified the police, okay? We've added extra security to campus. - What else can we do to help? - You keep her safe. Hey. Defense counsel will likely have it ruled inadmissible. - Is it useless? - I never said that. As we've positively established now Mr. Hogan's paternity, the court will proceed with the custody hearing. And is Mr. Hogan still joining us on teleconference from North Carolina again? Yes, Your Honor. I expect my petitioners in court for their hearings. Mr. Hogan... Is it your employment that keeps you out of my court? Yes, Your Honor.- ... Just checking, Your Honor. We were led to believe that, Mr. Hogan's business was closed and that he was currently unemployed. I'm between jobs. You know, it's been hard to find work... I'm not interested in your unemployment woes, Mr. Hogan. Historically, a father seeking parental rights shows up for the hearings. North Carolina is not that far. Just on the subject of locality, Your Honor, we have, photographic evidence that actually shows Mr. Hogan in Atlanta, specifically, and without permission, at the, school of Ms. Thompson... Objection, Your Honor. The counselor's constant interruptions are brazen attempts to prejudice you against my client. Merely trying to clarify Mr. Hogan's whereabouts for the court. Sustained. Sit down, please, Mr. Moss. Mr. Hogan, I won't allow your absence again. Understood? Counsel, can you advise your client to answer me? Yes, sir. I hear you. It's just, last time you interrupted me and... I'll interrupt you anytime I like. - We'll advise our client. - Your Honor. I'd like to alert the court to new discovery about Mr. Hogan's past as it pertains to a custodial hearing. - Proceed. - My client.. Has new documentary evidence that, Mr. Hogan's law enforcement discharge was actually due to sexual assault, which is reasonable to discuss with regard to Ms. Thompson's still open rape case against Mr. Hogan. Both counselors, please approach the bench. Your Honor, I must object, we're here for a custody hearing in family court, this is not a criminal court. My client has waited seven years... You don't need to tell me what court I am presiding over, counsel. Can someone please... What's going on? What's happening? I-I-I can't hear. Before we proceed with the custody case, I think it prudent that we hear evidence to determine whether or not a rape occurred. Your Honor, Georgia law is very clear. There is no legislation stopping a sexual assailant from claiming parental rights of a child. Individuals are free and clear to pursue custody or visitation rights of biological offspring. Excuse me, I can't hear, excuse me... Mr. Hogan, you'll speak when you're spoken to and not before. Counselor, thank you for the lesson in Georgia Law. My job is to assess the suitability of a parent and I can use any means at my disposal I so choose. Please set an evidentiary hearing for three weeks' time. Court stands adjourned. This is good. Yeah. Mama, my flower's crushing my ears. Well, we can't have that, can we, my little sunflower? There. I hope I don't forget the words. Not fragile like a flower... - Fragile like a bomb. - Fragile... bomb! That's right. Okay. Excuse me, um, can you, take her onto the stage, please? Do not let her out of your sight. - Okay, you're gonna be great. - Mom, you can't leave. - No, I'll be right here. - Okay. Okay. Didn't we make a beautiful flower? Thank you for keeping her, for loving what some would call unlovable. Desire, passion, it all gets distorted. We just see it differently is all. Fate brought us together. When you decided to have that baby, you kept me in your life forever, and hers. You raped me. We're not yours to keep. You know, they say that kids don't have any real memories until they're seven. Seven. She could know her daddy now. We could set things right for her and for us. - We can start over. - No. There's that word again. No is a complete sentence. What happened between us, well, it doesn't happen to everyone. It's what nature wanted. I-I can't wait to hold her. You stay away from her! You've been workin' out in self-defense, I see. Mama! I can still see you under me, trembling... I'm not trembling anymore. Yeah, you are. Mama! You know, I thought motherhood might have changed you. It has. I can still see you under me, trembling... I'm not trembling anymore. Give me that! - Mama! - Maddy! - Maddy, I'm your father. - Mama! - Maddy! - She doesn't have a father. - Look straight ahead. - It's alright, it's alright. In the matter of Hogan and Thompson, we've brought forth the parties. The court asks for the petitioner. We are unable to reach him, Your Honor. There's no note that a teleconference is needed for today. Is he in town? Not to my knowledge, Your Honor. So he's a no-show? Your Honor, may I address the court? We have a police report that places Mr. Hogan in Maddy Thompson's school where he had just threatened Ms. Thompson a week ago. - May I approach? - Yes. Thank you, counselor. Did petitioner ask for a postponement? No, Your Honor. I could ask for a civil arrest or issue a capias. Has your client indicated he wants to continue the case? May I speak, Your Honor? On what grounds does she want to speak? The court has made time to hear this case. In light of your client's continued disrespect, I'll allow it. You may speak, Ms. Thompson. The worst part of being raped, even more than my head getting slammed against my kitchen counter or the sound of my ribs cracking as I was thrown over my dining-room table or the smell of my blood on the floor... is that it is still happening... every single day. Every time I close my eyes, every time I hear someone behind me that I don't know, it just replays over and over and over. And now today I am forced to stand here and fight him off yet again because there are no laws in place to protect me, and more importantly, protect my child from this violent man. With your permission, Your Honor, I would like to play a recording of Mr. Hogan the last time he threatened me at my daughter's school. I object, Your Honor. I'll allow it. I can still see you under me, trembling... I'm not trembling anymore. Thank you, Ms. Thompson. You may sit down. Counselor, is there anything you'd like to say to the court before I rule on this matter? In the absence of my client... I have nothing further to add at this time. Noting the petitioner's absence and non-response and that there is no request for a postponement, the custody request in the matter of Hogan and Thompson is formally dismissed and the custody case is closed with prejudice. Further, the court acknowledges that the rape case remains open in the criminal court of Charlotte, North Carolina. Court stands adjourned. Congratulations. This is a big win. I didn't win. The judge closed the case with prejudice. That means it can't be opened again, ever. What about the next raped mother on the docket and the next and the next and the next? These laws are medieval. "Change is the law of life "and those who only look to the past or the present are certain to miss the future." Well said, Mr. Moss. JFK said it. I really liked him. Thank you. Mr. McDevitt... Um... Thank you doesn't even begin to... With or without me, you would have prevailed. You're a natural warrior. You're a mother. - Go to your mom. - Okay. Team Us always wins the day! That's right.
