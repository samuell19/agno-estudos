- Please, come join me. Please, come. - Gracias. - Bravissima. I'm a big fan of your voice. You have an exceptional talent. - Thank you. - Apologies. Where are my manners? What can I get you to drink? - Oh, I'm okay, thank you. - Please, after a performance like that, you certainly earned one, for sure. Yes? - Okay, I'll have a glass of red wine please. - Akheem, bring me one bottle of this new French red wine we just received yesterday. - Yes, sir. - You're from Chicago, right? You must be fan of cold winters then? - Oh no, I hate the cold actually. I'm from Florida, but I moved away as soon as I could. To chase a dream. And cold winters just became a price for that dream, I guess. - It's paradise here. Rarely gets below 72 degrees. I'm offering you three times whatever you make in Chicago to sing here in my club, exclusively for me. - My God, that's an amazing offer. - I'm so sorry, ma'am. Let me get that. - It's all right. - I'm so sorry. - It's not your fault. - Akheem, it's okay, calm down. She's right. It certainly was an accident. How long have you been working for me, Akheem? - Almost two months, sir. - Then you know the customer is king. The customer deserve excellent service, always. - Yes, sir. I'm so sorry, sir. I'm sorry, ma'am. - It's okay. - I'm so so sorry. - You should be sorry. Apologies. Why you don't go to get cleaned up a little bit? Then come sing for me something special. You work for me now. - So, I finally had to tell her last night. Bon voyage, Coco. You know, I know she was wrong for me from the moment we met, but was she beautiful, man. She had them long legs she would just wrap around me. Crystal blue eyes, like swimming pools of beauty. Just, mm. Hey, Mark, I'm over here just pouring my heart out to you and I feel like you're not even listening. Are you listening? - No. - Okay, all right. You're right. You were right, because I know, from the moment you met her you were all like ... - She wasn't right for you. - And why is that, exactly? - She was normal. - Well, yeah. Well you know this is all kinda your fault, right? - My fault? - Well yeah. We been working together for years now, man. All you gotta do is come out with me every once in a while, just have a couple drinks, and maybe you could steer me clear of the wrong girls. - I told you, I'm not into that singles dating thing. - Singles dating scene, man, that's all the dating scene is is a bunch of singles. Come on, man, you're the only guy I know who's got his ex-wife's name tattooed on his finger. - She wasn't my ex-wife when I got the tattoo. - Yeah, I know that. Just add a little something to it. What does that say anyway, Attila? - It's Akilah. Akilah. - Okay, so add a T and now it's Tequila. Right? You'd be the cool guy at the bar. You got Tequila on your knuckle. - They're here. Get serious. - Rock, paper, scissors? Hm? Okay. You always do rock anyway. - S'up, Los. - Hello, my friend. How you doing? - How the fuck you think I'm doing, man? Waiting out here in West Bumblefuck for your ass, man. What's up? - Let's not waste time. You got the money? - Yo, I aint wasting the time, man. All right, yeah, I got your paper. You got my shit? - Si. - All right. What's up, Jose? Oh, you too hard for that shit, right? This motherfucker. So what's up, man? We gonna transact, or we gonna bullshit, what? - Go check it out. - My brother's gonna get the money from your car. - Hey, hey, hey. Yo, Rambo, man, is that shit necessary? - I'm afraid it is, amigo. - Hey, yo, what's up with Senor Gun Show over here? - It's cool, man, just show him the paper. - Come on now, Handsome. Let me show you something real pretty. - What's up, man? Where's my shit? - Step into my office, my friend. - About to make your day, man. Come on. We happy? Yeah, that's your happy face. - Meat and potatoes, as promised. - Same quality as before? - Even better. - Yeah. We're good, give him the money. - Great. Well, it's been a pleasure doing business with you but don't take this the wrong way when I say, I'm not gonna lose any sleep if I never have to see your ugly fucking face ever again. Well, that's not good. - Yo, Phil. We good? Talk to me. - Never better. Just think we got a little lost in translation over here. - I'm gonna need you to pick up that bag. Or I will end you right here, right now. - Wait, so this whole time you could speak English? - Pick up that bag. - All right. - Slowly - Listen, man, okay, it was real rude of me, and if I'm being honest with myself, rather racist to assume you don't speak English. - Hey, LAPD, motherfucker. Drop it, drop it. Phil, talk to me. - He's a dead man. You both are. - Shut the fuck up. Hey, Phil? - Wait, wait! You're under arrest, LAPD! - Phil! - You might as well shoot, because I promise you, my family will come after you and everyone who loves you. - Phil? - Till all of your lifeless bodies are hanging from an overpass. - Hey, hey. Shut the fuck up was not a request. Shut up. Phil! - You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law. - You okay? - If you can't afford an attorney one will be appointed for you. Have you understood these rights as I have read them to you? Hey, amigo. Buddy? Ah, shit. Hey, Mark, do you think he heard that last part or am I gonna have to read him his whole Miranda rights warning all over again, because I don't wanna. - Well, judging by his rap sheet, I think he's heard it before. - You, uh, look clean. Your guy, he was a lot smaller. - True. Maybe you should cuff him. I don't know if you have the punching power to keep him out very long. - Oh, he's got jokes, and white pants. Heh. - Hey, it is not a good time. - We are gathered here today to celebrate the life of our brother Akheem. I have known Akheem's mother, Yvonne, and his brother Mark for a long time. I can remember the day Akheem was born, bringing with him into this world, and to this island, that infectious smile that all of us would soon know and love. I ask all of you now to remember fondly Akheem and his infectious smile. But also to let his tragic death be a reminder that we must collectively guard the lives of our youths. Because make no mistake about it, whereas our island is surely a gift from God, lest we forget the devil does not strike at us from afar. No. He slithers along the soil we call home. Waiting to coil around the feet of any who dare oppose him. Yvonne, I am so sorry. - Thank you, Akilah. - Please, come see me soon. - We never met. I'm Manuel Alvarez. I'm terribly sorry. My deepest condolence. If there is anything I can do for you, please let me know. - I'm so sorry for your loss. - I'm sorry, Son. I didn't get a chance to clean the house. - Mom, it's fine, it's fine. - But I'm glad you're home, baby. - Me too. - Let me get you something to eat. You must be hungry. - No, Mom. Mom, Mom, please, please stop. I just want you to relax. You don't need to be doing anything right now. Come, sit. Come, sit. - I have some things from your brother. - Okay. - He was wearing that when ... I'd like you to have it. - Thanks, Mom. Tell me what happened. - I don't, I don't know. He got a job, and he was staying out of trouble. - Trouble? - A lot has changed over the past seven years since you've been gone, Son. The island just isn't the same anymore. - I'm gonna find out what happened. - No, no, Mark. I just lost one of my sons. I cannot lose another. - Mom, listen to me, okay? Everything is gonna be okay. Just trust me. Get some rest, okay? It's gonna be okay. Hey, Mom, it's gonna be all right. Get some rest. - Okay. - I swear to God, it's not our stuff. I'm telling you, tell him. - Yo, somebody put that in our car. I promise you. - We've been set up. We were set up. A complete misunderstanding. It's a big misunderstanding, okay? It's the truth, I swear. - Yes, Brother. - Long time. - Yeah. Sit down, sit down. I'm really sorry about Akheem. He was a good kid. - Thank you. So what have you found out? - We go way back, so I'm just gonna give it to you straight. We don't have the same manpower that you do in LA. - I remember. - So this, this is gonna take some time. And right now, we don't have a whole lot to go off of. - This is all you have? - That's everything from the table. Maybe a fight with the gangs. - Gangs? - Yeah, there's been a lotta crime here on the island since you been gone. Especially with gangs from neighboring islands coming here to party. The drug traffic is way up. - So you think this is gang-related? - Like I say, this is gonna take some time to find out what actually happened. But when I do, you'll be the first to know. - All right. - Nine. 10! One! Two! Three! - Four! - Five! - Six! - Seven! - Eight! - Nine! 10! And one! Two! - Three! - Four! - Bye, Sensei Akilah. - Bye, Sensei. - See you guys next week. So, how's the big city treating you? - Well, not a day goes by that I don't think about the island, if that's what you're asking. - But you left. - And you know why I left? - Yeah. So, um ... Did you ever remarry? - No. You? - No. - Well I'm happy you kept up with your training. How long have you had the dojo? - Ah, going on about three years now. - Uh-huh. I'm impressed. The kids are lucky to have you. - You know, I um, I always hoped I'd see you again, but not like this. I am so sorry about Akheem, Mark. - Thank you. - How long are you staying for? - Long enough to find out what happened to Akheem. I went to the police station to talk to Nate. He says there are gangs here on the island. - Unfortunately, yeah. The gangs come over on the weekends from other islands and bring with them more drugs and crime. But I wouldn't hold on to too much hope in whatever Nate says or does. - Why is that? - Because people around here are afraid to make waves. - I'm listening. - This guy, Manuel Alvarez, everyone calls him the Company because he owns everything that's important on the island. He owns the bank, construction companies, hotels. In less than four years, he basically managed to control the entire economy of the island. Not to mention the only places that the gangs seem to avoid are the businesses he owns. And I'm pretty sure he controls them too, just to scare the people on the island. So whether they like it or not, a lot of people around here rely on him to survive. Do you remember Vanessa? - Yeah. - She's working at the bank and told me in confidence that hundreds of millions go through the bank now. - But what does that have to do with Akheem? - Two months ago, Akheem took a job as a bartender working for Alvarez. - What club? - Luna. Club Luna. What are you going to do, Mark? - I'm gonna do whatever it takes. Starting with a visit to this Alvarez. - Just be careful. - Can I help you? - Here to speak to your boss. - You're gonna have to make an appointment. - Not my style. - Your style? Perhaps you've not heard-- - It's okay. Please. Come, sit down. - No thank you. - Can I get you something to drink? - No. - So, how can I help you? - My brother worked for you? - He did. A lot of people work for me. - Mm. Here at this bar? - Yes. And he was a good bartender. - So you're aware that my brother was killed the night he was working here? - You know, I don't think I like the implication you are making. - I look like I care what you think? What the fuck happened to my brother? - You are upset, and I get it. And I'm here to help, but you're not going to find the answer you're looking for here. Your brother left after his shift at night, and it seems to me he may have gotten himself into some troubles with the gangs. Here. - What is this? - A spot, a bar actually, where a lot of the gangs that come over from other islands hang out. My people have told me that your brother used to go there after work. This is not the same island you grew up on. Not anymore. - You know, everybody keeps telling me that. - Change is inevitable. Good and bad, I'm afraid. - You're right about that. Changes are coming. So you might wanna move your business off of the island. - Oh. A threat by an LA police officer? Yes, I have friends all over America. I did my homework on you, Mark. - Apparently not enough. Otherwise, you'd be packing right now. I've done my homework on you too, Mr. Alvarez. And I know your type. And I promise you. The weather's about to get very bad for you here. - What do you want me to do? - Get the gangs from the north to handle him. - Teseam? - Mark. My brother. Welcome home and good to see you. You hungry? Hey, let me hook you up, man. - Nah nah, nah nah. No thanks, man. I'm here for something else. - Man, I'm sorry about Akheem. I really wanted to go to the funeral, but with six mouths to feed now, I got to-- - Wait. You and Dayana got four more kids now? - Yeah, brother, we've been blessed. But things have been tough, at least for those of us who still choose to do things the right way, you know? - Yeah. You remember that package I asked you to hold for me? - Of course. I buried it where you told me to. - Good. I'm gonna need it. - Shit is coming. - Shit is coming big time, brother. ♪ Only to be trapped in a nightmare world of madness ♪ ♪ Only to be ♪ - Hey, man, what the fuck? - Which of you is in charge? - Yo, big man, might wanna get outta here before you get hurt, yeah? - Look, I don't want any trouble. - Yo, bitch, if you're a cop, we got nothing to say. - Like I said, all I want is some information. My brother-- - If you're not a cop, you're in the wrong fucking place. - I'm not here as a cop. I'm here as a brother of the island who has lost his brother. And all I want is a little information about what happened to my brother. - Motherfucker, you do see I got a loaded gun, right? - Look, I realize you guys are not from the island, so you don't know me or my reputation. - Shoot this motherfucker, man. - All I want is ... some information. Like I said, I'm not here to hurt anyone. Okay? All I wanna know is if my brother Akheem was here on the night that he was murdered. - You broke my fucking nose. - You wanna tell me about my brother now? - Fuck your brother. - That's right. Had it, didn't need it. I could use it now if you like. - I don't know him. I never met him. We were just told to fuck some dude up looking for his brother. That's all I know. I swear. - I believe you. Thank you. - Yo, that's him! - He's here! - Let's go! That way! - Shoot him. - Yo, you guys see him anywhere? Shit, we lost him. Let's go. Fuck. I'll call him. We lost him. - That's very disappointing. I will deal with your failures later. Go to the mother's house. Use her to flush him out. - Understood. - Going dark. Fuck! - Here you go. - Thank you. - Don't mention it. Yvonne, everything is going to be okay. He's going to be okay. - You know, when you're a mother, you always have to worry. I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking. I'm so sorry. - It's okay. You know I really wish that I could tell you that after losing a child it gets easier. But even after seven years, it doesn't. - You two good? - Yeah. - Yeah. - You have a first-aid kit? - Yeah, I'll go grab it. - All right. - All right, so what we got? - We have a DOA. The rest have gone on to the hospital. - Jesus Christ. These boys got hit hard. Who else see it? - No one's talking. - All right, I'll take it from here. Just make sure you secure the perimeter. - Yes, sir. - Excuse me, sir. - Yes, Officer. - The station has been trying to get hold of you. - What is it? - They say there's a possible crime scene that you'd want to know about. - I have a crime scene here already. - It's at Akheem's mother's house. - Tell them I'm on my way. - Okay, sir. - Good thing nobody was home. - This time. - Any idea what happened to a buncha gang members earlier tonight at the beach bar? Hm? - Any idea what happened to my brother or who tried to break into my mother's house and kill her? - You have no idea what you are asking of me right now. This? This is so much bigger than your brother. - You're right. It's not gonna stop. Not unless you help me to make it stop. - I think you already know the answers to the questions you're asking. - This is our island, our home. My father build this house with his bare hands just like your father built yours. They wanted my mother to be there, Nate. Changes are coming. And you need to decide what side of those changes you're gonna be standing on. - Speak to the Luna's new singer. One of my informants told me she was working the night your brother was killed. Her name's Nora. She's staying at the motel by the church, Room 18. Is your mother somewhere safe? - Yeah. At Akilah's place. - Good. - I need to trust you, Nate. This island needs help, and I can't do it alone. - I don't think the word disappointed carries enough weight for what I'm feeling right now. - We did what you asked, Boss, after we lost him in town, but the house, it's empty. They must have known someone was coming. - So, this was my fault? - No, no, that's not what I meant, no. - Sh. It's okay, forget about it. You tried, right? You did the best you could with the information you had, but they knew you were coming. Right? - Y-yes, sir. Y-yes, sir. - Hey, hey, take it easy. Take a deep breath before you're hyperventilating. One thing I can't stand is excuses. And a lack of accountability. - Please. Please, please! - So, Fuck. - let's get back to the accountability. Please, no no no! Wait wait wait, wait! I have a photo, in my pocket. I think I know how to get this guy. She, she's a local. Runs the island dojo. - Are you gonna come back inside and finish fucking me or what? - I'll be back in a moment. - This cop? More trouble than we expected. He put the boys in the north gang in the hospital. - Make a call to our special friends, okay? - Who is it? - I'm a police officer from Los Angeles. Nora, please open the door. My name is Mark Ethridge. Akheem the bartender was my brother. Listen, if you know the information I'm looking for, then you're not safe, not here, not anywhere on the island, but I can help you. - Are you really a cop from LA? - You tell me about what you know, and I will get you off this island. - I can't. They will kill me. You have to go. If they see me talking to you-- - No no, Nora, Nora, Nora. Please. Just, look, calm down. No one is here, and no one is going to kill you. Now it is my job to protect people in your situation and I swear I will get you back to the U.S. - When? When can you got me out? - If you tell me what happened to my brother, I will get you out today, okay? I will have my partner meet you at the airport back in the U.S., and he will make sure you're safe. But, I need to know what happened. - He killed him. Right in front of me. Because he spilled some wine on me. - Alvarez? - Yes. I see it every time I close my eyes. I'm so sorry. I am so sorry. I just came here to sing. - It's gonna be okay. - Come on. Don't worry. You can trust him. - Are you sure? - I promise you. He's one of the good guys. Hey, I wanna thank you for telling me about what happened to my brother. So how we looking? - We're good. - Are you sure it isn't better for her to stick around? We could arrest him now, and with her testimony we could-- - There isn't gonna be any trial. And I promised to get her off the island. - We better get going. - Thank you. - No need to thank me for doing what's right. You can come with me. - It's all right. - I've got news. There was an eyewitness. Alvarez killed Akheem. - Everything has been taken care of. This boat will take you to a taxi that will get you to the airport. You can trust him. Here's your ticket. Mark's partner, Phil, will be waiting for you when you reach Miami. - Thank you. - One last thing. Leave the demons you're carrying, the ones in your head, behind on this island. There's no reason for you to carry them anymore. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Thank you. - We got company. We gotta move, go. - What's going on, Mark? - Mom, you gotta trust me. Still know how to shoot one of these? - Absolutely. - All right, good. Take Mom. - Okay. Okay, come on. - Right behind you. - Oh, you got to be kidding me. Shit. - You okay? - Yes. - You good? - I'm good. - Mom, you okay? - Yeah, I'm a little shaken, but I'm okay. - All right. - Mark! Akilah! - Go, Nate. - Thank God you're all right. It's clear. They're gone for now. - These guys were not amateurs. - Yeah, I know. You've awakened the devil. You have a plan? - Yeah, first thing is to get my mom somewhere safe. - You have a place in mind? - I do. - Good. I'm going back to the station, see what I can find out. - All right, meet you in a few hours. - Where? - The old sugar mill. - All right, stay safe. - Yeah. - So where is she? I thought you were keeping her locked up. Kind of hard for her to stay strung out if she's out of junk! - She never told me she was out. - Oh, she never told? - I'm sorry. Okay, I know I messed up. I'm sorry. - It's okay. Forget about it. When was the last time you saw her? - Yesterday, afternoon, when I dropped off some dope. I gave it to her, I swear. - Did she use it, in front of you? - I, I don't remember. - Oh, you don't remember? Don't remember. Do you have any on you now? - What? - The drugs you give her? Do you have some on you now? - Yeah, yeah, right here. Right here. See? Look, I'm sorry. Okay, I'm real sorry. I'm real sorry. - Hold him down. - No, please! - Open his mouth. Swallow it! Swallow it, junkie puta! Now, that's how you keep someone doped up. - Hey, Nate. - Everything go as planned? - Yeah, she's safe and sound. You get the email I sent? - Yeah, looking at it now. Thanks for helping me with this. Our resources on the island are tight. - Yeah, happy to help. You know, the fingerprints belong to a sicario, a member of a pretty vicious Colombian cartel. What's going on down there, man? Give it to me straight. Mark aint telling me anything, and these are not small-town players. - I know. I got to go. Thanks again. - You got it. - Hey, Yvonne. Good to see you, welcome. Akilah. - Hi, Teseam. Glad to see you. - Hey, Brother. Hey, guys, let's go. Come inside. Welcome to my home. Hey, you kids be careful around our guests, okay? - It's okay, the laughter of children is the most beautiful thing in the world. You know, I remember when you two were the same age, nothing but trouble. - Kids, get in here and eat. - I'll help you with that. - Thanks, Yvonne. Welcome to our home. - Thank you. - Hey, Dayana. - Hello, Mark. It's good to see you. - You too. Are you sure this is okay? - Of course. Dayana and I wish that there was more we could do to help. - Hey, taking care of my mother and Akilah is more than enough, bro. - You mean taking care of your mother. I'm not staying. - Akilah, you need to stay here. - What I need is to be there for my island. - Akilah, please. - And to be there for you too. - All right. I'll be back as soon as I can. - Stay safe, my friends. Don't worry about your mother. She gonna be safe here with us. Akilah, take care. Be safe. - Thank you. - Forgive me, Father. I can't even remember the last time I came to church. - As one of God's children, all that matters is that you are here now. Go on. What is on your mind, my son? - I need to ask you to do something for me. Please keep it safe. - I don't understand. What is it? - If anything happens to me, open it and I'll trust you'll know what to do. - We could be in real trouble here. We sent the Amore. - Si, Carla. I take care, don't worry about it, okay? - I might have a solution. - You better, because if they have her, then she can testify against you. - I'll find her. - No you won't. If she's gone, it means they got to her. And if they got to her, then that means they can bring an international warrant against me. - And if you're still here, it means that little piece of shit is still breathing. - He is, but we have a card to play, if you're willing to play it. - I'm willing to play it. Do what it takes. - It's messy. - Everything I did for this island is in jeopardy because of this man! I will make a mess if I have to, believe me. - I don't understand why you just don't let Nate make a case against him. And put an end to all of this. With that singer's testimony, he'll spend the rest of his life in jail. - Because guys like him don't end up in jail, Akilah. - Mark, he's never going to stop. - And neither am I. There's only one way this ends. - To carry a life inside of me, for nine months, one that you and I created together. And to never get to hear her cry. Or see her open her eyes to look at me. To never get to hold her against my skin. Or see her take her first steps. Or watch her grow up. - Akilah. - It broke me, in more ways than I ever thought was possible. I was so, so numb to everything that wasn't heartache. And I know it broke you too. It broke you so much that you had to leave. - Akilah, why are you talking about this now? - Because nothing that either of us does will ever bring her back. She's gone, Mark. You can't save her. - But I can save our island. - But at what cost? I don't want to lose you too. I don't think that I could take being broken anymore. - You will never lose me. It's Nate. Nate? Nate? Talk to me. Wait here. Nate? Nate? - Mark. - Nate. Hey, talk to me. - Mark. I'm sorry about this. They're gonna kill your family. - Sh, relax. Take deep breaths. Slow, slow. Everything's gonna be all right. Akilah! - I'm sorry. - Sh sh, sh sh. Relax. Think about all the times we, we were here and we played cricket together. - With your brother. - I'm so glad that you were able to help teach him for me. And he was always so stubborn, and before long, he was better than both of us. Take care of him, my friend, until we meet again. - God commands us to speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves. For the rights of the destitute. To speak up. To judge fairly. Reach out to someone in your community. One of your neighbors. Help those less fortunate than yourself. This is what God-- - I'm sorry, Father. May I please speak with everyone? Just for a moment? - Here. - Thank you. My family immigrated to this island from the States when I was only two years old. Many of this community helped us to build a new life here, so that we could call this island our home. Now look, I know many of you rely on the jobs and the many businesses owned by Manuel Alvarez. But I'm here to tell you that he has taken Akilah hostage and has killed both my brother Akheem and now, my friend, our police chief, Nate Wayland. Nate Wayland died an honorable man, who fought for what's right and for the island that we love and have called home. Please, don't let him or my brother die in vain. Help me find Akilah. And help me put an end to this devil who has coiled himself around all our feet and is trying to choke the life out of our island. Please, if you hear or see anything, reach out to me at the police station. Thank you. - That concludes everything for today. Mark? A moment please. Nate asked me to hold onto it. - What is it? - I don't know. He said, if something happened to him. And with his passing, I just think he would want you to have it. - Thank you, Father. - Wake up, bitch! - Where am I? What do you want with me? Answer me! - She's not answering you because she don't work for you. She work for me. And I'm getting really tired of your boyfriend getting in my way. - Then you're really gonna be upset when he kills you. - Oh, aren't you a clever one? But it's going to be hard to be clever without a tongue. - You're gonna pay for that, bitch. Then just get it over with and kill me now if you're really gonna do it. - In time, I'll do just that. But unfortunately for you, it won't be quick. No, I'm going to take my time and enjoy so much. Eventually, you'll beg me to kill you. Don't leave her sight. - Everyone. Listen up. Nate was a good man who died fighting to protect this island. And now, I have taken over as acting chief of police so I can do what needs to be done. Now if any of you would like to leave, you can leave now. Good. Now the first thing I want you to do is get the word out all across the island that I will be here, waiting for Alvarez. Ah. Okay. Cartel drug money. You've been building a case against Alvarez for money laundering. Mm, gotcha. - I won! - No fair. You're taller. - Look, Desmond. - Who's that? - Sh. Come on. That's the guy who's always with him. Did he see us? - No. - Come on. Let's get outta here. - Hello. - A police officer just came here looking for the boss. - What'd you tell him? - That he wasn't here and I don't know where he is. - All right, you did the right thing. - Wait, there's more. Before he left, he told me that Mark has replaced the chief of police and now he's at the station waiting for the boss to make a move. - Understood. - Excuse me, sir, these two children say that they saw something and may be able to help you. - Oh. Hello, kids. So, what did you see? - Mr. Mark? - Just Mark is fine. - We saw him. - Who did you see? - The man who is always with the Manuel guy. - Oh, mean-looking guy, looks like Mr. Clean, never smiles? - Yeah, that's him. - So, where was this? - We saw him at the old abandoned hotel. - The one by the water? - Yep. - You two kids did very well. But listen, do not go anywhere near there, okay? And tell nobody. It's very, very important. - Okay. - Okay. - All right, run along. Thanks, Sergeant. - Awfully young for some CIs. - Phil, what the hell are you doing here? - Not exactly a warm island welcome. It's nice to see you too, partner. - This does not concern you. - Oh, it doesn't concern me. Well, um, I have been stashing potential witnesses for you in safe houses and running fingerprints for your buddy Nate on a Colombia sicario working for the Cali Cartel. But, sure, it doesn't concern me. I'm good, by the way. Thank you, for not asking. - How's the girl? - She's safe. Hence the word safe house. How's your buddy Nate? - Well he's been killed. Hence, why I'm sitting at his desk. - Then I guess you need my help more than I thought. Come on, cut the bullshit, man. Catch me up. - Who's this? - I think it's time we meet. - When and where? - Tomorrow. 7:00 AM. At the old sugar factory in ruin. Come alone. Unarmed. And bring Nora. I'll bring Akilah. - I need to know she's alive. - Your boyfriend, he want to know you're still alive. - Mark, don't worry about me! Kill the bastard! - Oh, she's a nasty one. 7:00 AM. - Oh, yo, Mark, what's up, man? This beach house you got me is fucking bitchin', dude. I could see myself staying here a long time. - Phil, Phil, listen. I just spoke to Alvarez. I need you to assemble a team. We leave first thing in the morning. - Copy that, buddy. - I'm here. What's your 20? - Little busy. Let me get back to you. Moving in position now. - All right, you got five minutes. - Okay, Dad. I'm embarrassed you think it's gonna take me that long. - Well I'm accounting for four minutes of your blabbing and one minute of actual action. - You know, this only works if one of us is the funny one and the other one's mean and gruff, right? - Hurry the fuck up and save Akilah. Better? - I did miss you. Going dark. Let's move. Come on! - Hands up. He's clean. - Good. Well, I appreciate a man who shows up early for an appointment. - Where's Akilah? - Where is Nora? - You'll get her as soon as I know Akilah's safe. - You know, I don't think you're really in a position to negotiate here. Where is she? - I just need to make a call. - Well, I suggest you do just that. - I need you to bring her now. Do you copy? - Talk to me. Is there a problem? - No problem. It's just that we're here early, remember? - Don't waste my fucking time. - Wait wait. Wait, hey, let's talk about this, huh? - Drop it and come out real slow. - All right here, look. My gun, all right? Here we go, okay? That's all I want. You're a dick. Shit. Hey, hey, I'm with Mark. Akilah, right? We gotta get you outta here. - Drop the gun! - All right, hey, taking the gun out. Taking the gun out. Okay? - Guns! - Okay, okay. - Shut up! - See? See? Okay, okay. Tranqilo, amigo, huh. - Hey! - She, she's safe, Mark. - She's safe. - It's seven o'clock. Where is she? - Nora won't be coming back to the island. She's safe. - Well, I wish I could say the same for Akilah. Kill her. Did you hear me? Kill the! - I don't believe they can hear you, because they're in the afterlife. - Well, then, I have no more use for you. Kill him. - You're right, Alvarez. Things are changing. Starting with you. - Now what? You're just gonna let your little friends shoot me? - I thought about it. But I'm gonna give you a choice that you didn't give my brother. You wanna live? You have to get through me. - Let us shoot him, brother. - I wish you could have seen your brother's eyes when I bled the life from his body. - I guess I'm gonna have to settle for yours. - You don't know what you're dealing with. My associates will come for you. - I look forward to it. I told you the weather was gonna be bad for you. Now, look at me. This is the last face you will ever see. Take it to hell with you. - So, did you decide to stay? - I have never left. - You're right. You never did - Hey, hey, there you guys are! I been looking for you! I got some beers! I'm sorry, are you having a, are you having a moment? Come on! Let's have a drink! Oh, you guys want some alone time? All right, I get it. I get it. No, cheers, cheers to you. All right? - That's your partner? - Yeah, believe it or not. You'll get used to him. - Okay.
