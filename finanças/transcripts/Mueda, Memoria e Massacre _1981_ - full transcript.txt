Awards: Union of People's Friendship and Film Culture, Tashkent (USSR) 1980 June 16th Some men had started discussions with the authorities asking for freedom and better pay. While the population supported the leaders the authorities sent the police to invite everyone in the villages for a meeting in Mueda. Several thousands of people came. Meanwhile, the administrator asked the state governor of Cabo Delgado to come with a group of troops but these troops stayed in hiding. We could not see them. On the appointed date and after talking about what the peanut trade would be like that year the governor asked the crowd who would like to speak. There were many candidates so the governor asked them to make a separate group. So, without further ado he ordered the police to arrest those people in the group. The police started beating them up. I was nearby, I saw everything. When the others saw what was going on they started demonstrating against colonialists. In the meantime, they put the prisoners, with their hands tied, into police trucks. The crowd protested and got closer to the police to prevent them from taking the prisoners. So, the governor called the troops and told them to shoot. They killed around 600 people on the June 16th, 1960. "A Survivor." Origins of the Mozambican people... When the Portuguese arrived in Mozambique in the year 1498 they found a chief, an Arab named Mussa Al Mbique on the Island of Mozambique. Bantu is the name of the large group of languages that we speak. The first inhabitants of Southern Africa including Mozambicans were Khoisans, people of small stature. They were nomads. After the Khoisans came the Hottentot people who were rather advanced in social life. The Khoisans fled to the Kalahari Desert where they still are today. Let's read... MUEDA: MEMORY AND MASSACRE Every year, on the day of the massacre, the "Mueda Drama" is staged. The play takes place at the location where the actual event took place, featuring actors and audience members who witnessed the historic tragedy making it more lively and active. This film, based on this popular memory, is dedicated to all the Mozambican people. Viva FRELIMO! Viva! Viva FRELIMO! Viva! May you all feel welcome! - We do! Ladies and gentlemen, we now want to talk to you about that event in memory of the Massacre of Mueda, which occurred here in 1960. We request that you remain orderly and alert until the start of the shooting. Every person who is stopped should maintain a good posture and behave orderly. Because we're now independent. This is no time to open your mouth without thinking or to be careless. Otherwise people out there could laugh at you. Avoid scratching yourselves and giving us a bad image. This film will be shown in Europe and the rest of the world. So it'd be good if each of you would maintain a good posture. Maintain silence and a good posture so that those who see you can say "Yes, sir, that person knows how to behave." While we're acting, they'll begin to shoot. Once they start shooting, we'll all back up a bit. But don't go back home. It's just a matter of taking a few steps back. You shouldn't suddenly exit. That wouldn't be good. In short, I'd like to request you, my colleagues, to maintain a good posture. As I've said, this film will go as far as Europe. Viva FRELIMO! - Viva! So... let's make room for the filming to begin before the sun shines down where there's now shade. Viva FRELIMO! - Viva! Everything fine? Everything's fine. Where are you from? - From Tanganyika. Where are you going? - To talk to the whites. And what will you say? - I'll talk to the whites. I'll first inform them and then come and talk to you. But I'll speak with the whites. Please... Excuse me! There's someone outside. Where is he from? - He says he's from Tanganyika. From Tanganyika? - Yes. So tell him I want to meet him. Uncle! Come here, quick. You, quick, without delay. Where are you from? - From Tanganyika. What are your intentions? - I've come to talk to the whites inside. You've got a mouth to talk to whites? - I can talk to whites. Don't you know that you're black? - I know I'm black. Tell it to me. I'm white. I'm already enough. First I have to tell them. Then I'll tell you. Tell me! - I know you're white, I'll tell you. I already told you not to move your arms when you talk. Tac-Tac Mandussi, make him wait here while I go and tell the whites. Come. So what happened? There's someone here, but he's black. He wants to talk to the Lord Administrator. He's black like you? I'm white. - You're white? - Yes, sir. He's from Tanganyika, right? - Yes. Tell him to enter. To enter! - Yes. Tac-Tac Mandussi! Hello. Come here. Come on, hurry. Go ahead, then. Here's the black. Ask him why he came here. Why are you here? - To ask for independence. He came to ask for independence. Does he know who created Mozambique? Do you know who built Mozambique? I know. It was us, the Mozambican people. He knows. It was the Mozambicans themselves who created Mozambique. Doesn't he know that it was us, the Portuguese, who created Mozambique? You don't know that it was us, the whites, who created Mozambique? It belongs to us, you didn't create it. It existed when you arrived by boat. He's saying that the Portuguese are fish who came from the sea. I can't... It was us who cut off their tails! It was us whites who cut off your tails. You were monkeys. We were never monkeys. You're fish that came by boat. Ask if he can discuss the problems with me. You're so black. You can talk to this white? Yes, I talk to him because he's on my land. He can talk... - No, he can't! Send him back to Tanganyika! Send him back to where he came from...Tanganyika! Take him back to where he came from. I'm Faustino Vanomba. I work at the Inhambane post office. I am 56 years old. At that time I left Mozambique and headed towards Tanganyika. What led me to Tanganyika were Mozambique's low salaries. In Tanganyika there was work and it was paid well. I lived in Dar es Salaam for twelve years. After Tanganyika's government achieved independence I asked the Government of Tanzania the permission to go and ask the people in Mozambique why it was not independent yet. At that point, I was still alone and left for Mozambique on February 2nd, 1959. I contacted people asking why they weren't requesting independence. People said they didn't request it out of fear. I asked: "If someone else requests independence, will you follow him?" The Mozambican people said yes that they'd follow someone to free the country. I went to talk to the administrator of Mueda. But he sent me back to Tanganyika. I was accompanied to Newala. In Newala, I caught a flight to Dar es Salaam. Once in Dar es Salaam many people approached me and asked what I had said in Mozambique. I called together a meeting and explained to the MANU members what had happened. Ah, Macímboa da Praia! Hello, Macímboa da Praia! Mueda calling! I request that you inform Vitor Golpe to bring 57 chickens and 80 eggs for the administrator. Secondly, we ask you to send 100 blacks for the cleaning work around the house of the Lord Administrator. Hello, Macímboa da Praia! Mueda calling! Hear that? Macímboa da Praia! Hello, Macímboa da Praia! Mueda calling! I request that you inform Vitor Golpe to bring 57 chickens and 80 eggs for the administrator. Secondly, we ask you to send 100 blacks for the cleaning work around the house of the Lord Administrator... These are your documents? Where are you from? This guy fled to Tanganyika. - The stamp is from Tanganyika. Take off your hat. He's from Tanganyika, right? - Yes. How dare you leave Tanganyika and come here? - I'm not from Tanganyika. I'm from the Catholic mission. - Mission? So what is this? Where did you get that shirt? - The shirt is from Tanganyika. Tie him up and take him inside. You guys take that man inside fast. The war began with the arrival of Tiago from Tanganyika. When he came, he encountered the Portuguese. He said: "You've governed here for a long time. Time to go back to your own land." The Portuguese said: "Where did that crazy person come from? This guy is saying crazy stuff." But we didn't know that Tiago belonged to another party: MANU. We only said that he was doing a good thing. That's when the Portuguese called Ernesto and told him to accompany Tiago to his country. So Ernesto took Tiago to Newala. After Ernesto's return came Zacarias Vanomba, who also intended to expel the Portuguese. He said: "You've governed for a long time. Now we want to govern our own country." The Portuguese believed that he should be expelled. Good morning. - Where are you going? - To the administration. Excuse me, excuse me. How are you, uncle? - I'm fine. Where are you going? - To the administration. To do what? To meet with the whites. - To do what? We're going to talk to the whites. And say what? It's none of your business. - You'll know when we're inside. Is that your wife? - No, she's my co-worker. What's your name? - Tiago Mula. And you? - I'm Modesta. The guy ran off with a bike. - That was your fault! You were sleeping! But you don't know what cassava is? You've never seen cassava? What's going on? - I didn't come here to talk to you. Where are these people going? - I don't want to talk to you. Why are you carrying a cassava? Aren't you Mozambicans? Don't you know what a cassava is? I don't want to talk to you. Careful, she's unlucky. Me, unlucky? No, you're unlucky. You'll certainly end up alone, these whites will leave you here. Are these the people? - Yes, they are. Where are you coming? - From Tanganyika. From Tanganyika? Is that your wife? - No, she's my colleague. Is this your husband? - No, he's my co-worker. Women work? - Yeah, why shouldn't they? Tac-Tac Mandussi, take these people over there. What's going on? Two people from Tanganyika have come. Are they white? - No. Are they black? - They're black. Two blacks, right? What do they want? They say they want to talk to the Lord Administrator. Send them in. Tac-Tac Mandussi! Yes? Come in! Is the problem the hat or we, the people? Don't touch the table of whites. This is them. So ask what they want. You from Tanganyika, what do you want? - We want independence. They want independence. - What? They want independence. - Do they know what independence is? Do you know what independence is? - Yes, we do! That's why we're here! They know what independence is. Ask if they know who created Mozambique. Do you know who created Mozambique? Yes, we do. Mozambique is ours. We blacks are the owners of this country. They think blacks can talk with whites like me? You think blacks can talk with whites? We'll say our opinion even if it's to a white. Yes, they can. What? Don't they know it was us whites who cut off their tails? Don't you know you were monkeys and we whites cut off your tails? Not at all. We're not monkeys. - We're on our land. We're not foreigners. You're fish because you came by boat. So we want our independence. Is this your wife? No, I'm a co-worker. - A co-worker? Women work? Of course women work. Both of them are workers. What's that? It's cassava. We brought cassava for you to plant in your country. To sustain you! - A gift? Arrest them! These people have come to insult us! You can arrest us, but you'll return to your land. This land isn't yours! You can arrest us but this land belongs to us. You don't have land here. Sooner or later you'll return to your own land. Look at you! Shame on you! The whites will leave and you'll stay here because it's your land. Get out of here! Don't touch me! Send the car immediately! Send them to Porto Amélia! This country is ours. You will leave! We'll stay here because this is our land. And you stink! Get out! Bunch of scoundrels! You're being used as a doormat! You can arrest me, but I'm on my land! Shame on you! Shut up! You stink! Shame on you! Who is this? - This is the chief. So how are you, my friend? - Alright. And at home? - Everything's fine. I wanted to come two days ago, but it got too late. That's fine, no problem. Wait for me here. The chief has arrived. Everything fine with you? - Yes. Have you brought chickens? - No, I haven't. Why? - Hyenas ate them. In all of the village, no one has chickens? - No, they don't. Look, are you telling the truth? - Yes. OK. Wait right there. My friend, these whites are asking too much. - For sure. The chief has come. So has he brought the chickens? - He hasn't brought anything. Then ask him to bring them. Hello, Porto Amélia! Call at once! Call Lourenço Marques at once! We want to inform you that blood has begun to spill here in Mueda! This is the black. So ask where the chickens are. Where are the chickens? - I don't have any. He says he has no chickens. - Say it again. There are none! - You don't have any chickens? Is he kidding the authorities? Are you kidding the authorities? - I'm not kidding, the chickens died. He's not kidding. All the chickens have died. So beat his palms 50 times. Come on, come on. Hello, Macomia, Macomia! Mueda calling! Hello, Macomia, Mueda calling! Alas, woe is me! Alas, woe is me! Beat that guy! He refused to give me a drink in his house! He refused to give me a drink in his house! - He has to learn! On top of that, he didn't bring any chickens. Oh mother! Mom, I'm dying because of chickens! My job is to cultivate. My second job... My second job is to receive government orders in order to provide the necessary support for the population. I'm the Social Affairs Commissioner... ...in Lilondo. The war started because we're demanding our land. First Tiago came to Mueda. He spoke to the Portuguese, but was chased away and is gone. A Sepoy was sent to accompany him out. He was sent away. And in fact, he was accompanied to the Rovuma River. The next morning Faustino Vanomba appeared. He also reached Mueda and he said: "I've come to demand our land." He was alone. He too was sent away. Shortly after that, Shibiliti came with a woman. Excuse me, excuse me. - Welcome. How are you, uncle? - I'm fine. Here again, uncle? - Yes, now I've come with our top leader, this gentleman. So you're in charge of these people? - Yes, I am, or rather, we are. You'll get into trouble. - No, I'm within my rights. You sit here... The others, stand back. Back up, back up. Hello, Porto Amélia! Hello, Porto Amélia! Mueda calling! They've come here, the claimants from Tanganyika! They're here at the Mueda Administrative Office to demand independence for Mozambique! Their names are: Faustino Vanomba, Modesta, Shibiliti, and another time Faustino Vanomba and Shibiliti came. Hello, Porto Amélia, call Lourenço Marques at once! Stay away, stay there. It's these people. So ask them what they want. - What do you want? We want independence. - They want independence. What? - They want independence. Do they know what independence is? - Do you know what independence is? Yes, we do. - They know what independence is. Are you the president? - Yes, I'm the president of MANU. I've come in person because of the reports I received from delegates who had come saying the whites are being complicated and don't want to give in. - He's in charge, he sent the people. He's responsible for this group of people? So ask him if a black can govern. So a black like you can govern? Yes, why not? Don't they know that this is an Overseas Province of Portugal? Don't you know that Mozambique is a Province of Portugal? Mozambique belongs to us Mozambicans. That's why we're requesting to govern it ourselves. They say that they know Mozambique belongs to the Mozambicans. Then tell them the matter they've mentioned is very important. We've received your message, it has been registered. So they need to present themselves to the Governor of Cabo Delgado. You'll have a meeting with the Governor of the Cabo Delgado District So he can listen and closely monitor your problems. So he can listen and monitor your problems. They must now return to their villages. You must now return to the villages where you're staying. They must inform everyone to come here next Thursday. You should inform all the people to come next Thursday. Your claims have been heard here by the administration. Your problems are being considered. I am the top leader. - This one has a few words to say. Don't treat me as you treated the other delegates who came here. Don't deceive them. - Send them away! Understood, understood. No problem. Now write a message to Porto Amélia requesting that the Governor come here on the 16th. See you on Thursday. Was the conversation good? - They told us to return on Thursday. Go and tell all village chiefs to attend next Thursday and not to bring knives or metal tools. They should bring goats and food and the like, including their taxes. The ones with no children should bring a stone on their back. On Thursday, early in the morning everyone comes together. - Yes. I forgot again. - Forgot? They should bring their "payment of tax" receipt. - So what do you want? - Nothing. Hold out your hands. - Alas, woe is me! Don't forget again, you hear? He always does this, it's always like this. We had already warned you to pay attention so you understand things. See what happened? You brought this upon yourself. - Now, go! You've seen how deep the wound can get. When is it going to heal? You mustn't forget anything. Did you see what happened to you? Poor you! Let me give you a massage. Go away, go away. You took a beating? Let go of me. Soldier! - Ready! You were beaten? The way of the Mashemba, to assault! Assault! The way of the Mashemba, to assault! Assault! FREEDOM AND WORK The way of the Mashemba, to assault! Assault! After the death of the whites in Mueda, Nyerere became the governor there. After the death of the whites in Mueda, Nyerere became the governor there... I am Ernesto. I was a Sepoy. Ernesto Shipakali. I used to be a Sepoy for the administration of Mueda. On June 16th Faustino Vanomba and Shibiliti Duane arrived. They came with the intention of talking with the government. Wherever we go, we have to win! Wherever we go, we have to win! After the death of the whites in Mueda, Nyerere became the governor there. After the death of the whites in Mueda, Nyerere became the governor there... Nyerere's ideas fly as if they were airplane. The ideas of the natives fly as if they were kites. Nyerere's ideas fly as if they were airplane. The ideas of the natives fly as if they were kites. After the death of whites in Mueda, Nyerere became the Governor there... Good morning. - Good morning. After the death of the whites in Mueda, Nyerere became the governor there. The ideas of the natives fly as if they were kites. The ideas of the natives... Suddenly, two guys showed up. We had already been informed... - Then those two showed up... After the death of the whites in Mueda, Nyerere became the governor there. After the death of the whites in Mueda, Nyerere became the governor there... He's a black called Julius Nyerere. Yes, I remember very well that there was a conference in Berlin where we were talking about him. Yeah, yeah... He's that gentleman who's feeding those blacks, right? So they're the people with those tattoos? Yes, they are! And where do they cross? They cross the Rovuma River. They always arrive here. It's easy for them to cross the Rovuma River here to go to Tanganyika or Mozambique. Be quiet, the governor has arrived! Bring the goats! - Bring the goats! It's a dangerous day... They want independence for this Overseas Province of Portugal. To that end, they have a political organization called MANU. The party was founded one month ago. So they're asking for freedom for this Overseas Province of Portugal. That's what they want. But even so, we'll solve this in cold blood. Yeah, yeah. All right then, interpreter, tell the sepoys to hoist the flag. The governor needs to see the raising of the flag. Quick! So I commanded the... These blacks are executioners!

Calm down, let's hoist the flag. - We don't care! Viva Portugal! - Viva! When a white man says, "Viva Portugal," you must respond "Viva," with your hand raised. We haven't come for that, we want our independence. Calm, calm, calm! Today we're gathered here, it's a historic day. This is an important day to say something. Two flags are being hoisted, a white and a red one. Two flags were hoisted a red and a white one. The white flag is for you. And the red one for us whites. The white flag below is for you blacks. The red one above is for them, the whites. That's funny! Calm! As of now, we're independent! From now on, we're all independent! All the people who are here in Mozambique are Portuguese. All the people who are in Mozambique are white! Calm, calm! Now! Mozambique is an Overseas Province of Portugal! All the people who are here in Mozambique are Portuguese! All the people who are in Mozambique are white! We don't want that! We don't want that! Settle down! You guys are very stubborn! Everyone calm down so we understand each other.

We want independence! After the death of the whites in Mueda, Nyerere became the governor there. After the death of the whites in Mueda, Nyerere became the governor there... Ask what he wants! - What do you want? We want independence. - They want independence. Ask if they know what independence is! Do you know what independence is? - I do, that's why I'm here. He knows what independence is. A black like that! - A black like you knows what independence is? Yes, yes, I know I'm black, but I know that this country belongs to me. What's he saying? He's black, yes, and he can handle governing. Call the other one! Hurry! - Tac-Tac Mandussi, call the other one! Ask what they want! What do you want? - We want freedom! He wants independence. - Independence, the same thing? We'd rather give independence to monkeys than to these blacks. When we found them here, they had tails. We cut them off! Independence, it's always the same... It'd be preferable to give independence to the monkeys than to these blacks. We know we're not monkeys and don't have tails. We're the people of Mozambique! By governing and despising us you treat us as if we were monkeys, but we're not monkeys. What are you saying? We're not monkeys and have no tails. And yes, the Portuguese are fish that came from the sea. Call the priest to baptize these people. Kill them to show what monkeys they are! Father! Worthless men in frocks! So baptize those blacks! I want to baptize you. - I don't want to be baptized. You'll die right here. - Even if I die, Mozambicans will govern this country. What is he saying? - He's refusing to be baptized. Seize him, quick! Tac-Tac Mandussi, seize him! Even if they kill us, we will govern! Even if they seize us, this won't end here! Listen! Settle down! Your leaders were arrested. The blacks who you're proud of came from Tanzania and were arrested! Tac-Tac Mandussi, put those blacks in a car! There were a lot of people. They began to get angry. When they got angry, they called for the governor, who came with his soldiers who had been hiding below. When they arrived here the noise began. The others threw stones at the governor and everyone else who was on the porch. After the governor fell, he got up again. Then he ran inside and told them to open fire. Now... Then Aspirant Godinho gave a signal. After seeing the signal, the soldiers came running out from below and opened fire. I also fired shots. I don't know if they died. They're all lying on top of each other. People died that day. Many people. Our leaders will not be taken away! A woman got run over! Let's go! Hello, Porto Amélia, Mueda calling! Papa Tango... We report yet another situation and call Lourenço Marques immediately. Papa Tango... The Lord Governor had already met with the blacks here in Mueda. And now in the moment of the blacks' refusal we had already committed the massacre here in Mueda. At that time, I became a servant in the hospital. I received the wounded. After the massacre people were treated, healed and returned to their communities. At that time, at the hospital worked Dr Joaquim Santana de Quadro. Collect the bodies! This lady is heavy! These women are adventurous! - What should we do with this? This one looks like Biti Nkalinga! She's dead! For the glory of giving life for the people so the people could live! For the glory of giving life for the people so the people could live! We accept suffering and even death for the people! We give our lives for the people! We give our lives for the people! We accept suffering and even death for the people! We give our lives for the people! We give our lives for the people! For glory, we surrendered our blood with our people's deaths! For glory, we surrendered our blood with our people's deaths! The Mozambican people, after the humiliation and constant exploitation of Portuguese colonialism, felt tired and on June 16th, 1960 headed to the Mueda District to request their human dignity. Portuguese colonialism responded with bullets. Salazar's fascist government without pain or shame killed an unarmed man like this and a woman like this not recognizing our human dignity. Innocent people! Due to the fatigue of the exploitation of man by man, Mozambicans felt obliged to demand their freedom and human dignity. Salazar's fascist government replied with bullets! The fact that our heroic brothers were killed on June 16th, 1960 in Mueda showed utter exhaustion of the exploitation of man by man. They defended their cause at the risk of their lives. We brothers are the living example that we shed our blood for the fatherland and national freedom. Today isn't a festive day but a memory of moral sentiments. Everyone feels the massacre with full force, everyone united in progress! The creation of a popular democracy! The fight goes on! - It goes on! Viva FRELIMO! - Viva! Thanks! When this day arrives and the Massacre of Mueda is staged, I'm not Tac-Tac Mandussi, I just imitate what he did. We were from the same neighborhood, had the same ancestors, were born at the same time and had similar childhoods... When we stage this play here, those who see us laugh. I try to act exactly as he did. We're aware that they're laughing at the attitudes of the Portuguese colonizers. We're aware that they're laughing at the things Portuguese people did to us here in this country. I conclude my remarks here. Long live the united people! Long live the united people! Guitar, guitar... Bullet, bullet... Classroom, classroom... Skin... skin. The people's struggle is just! The people's struggle is just! The people's struggle is just! Viva! Viva! Long live the united people! After the death of the whites in Mueda, Nyerere became the governor there. After the death of the whites in Mueda, Nyerere became the governor there.

Two years after the Massacre of Mueda, on June 25th, 1962, FRELIMO was formed. On September 25, 1964, the first shot was fired against the Chai Administrative Office. The armed struggle for liberation began. We thank the people of Mueda, the Provincial Government of Cabo Delgado the F.P.L.M, and the Federal Ministry of Culture. It's a dangerous day, it's a dangerous day... The way of the Mashemba, to assault! Assault! Today will be the departure of whites! Today something good, good! Let us know something good!
