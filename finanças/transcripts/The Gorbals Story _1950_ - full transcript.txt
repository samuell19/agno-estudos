'So now here am I, 'John Martin, 'the more-or-less successful artist. 'Forgotten, or almost forgotten, 'are the days when I was a poor Glasgow newspaper boy. 'Whenever I can, I come back to Scotland, 'sometimes to paint my native hills, 'sometimes to paint my native city. 'I have struggled hard to make my way. 'Whatever the result, in myselfl have at least found some form of beauty. 'Glasgow. 'My own Glasgow. 'My dear Glasgow. 'It still fascinates me. 'The city of well-stocked shops, 'large and spacious stores, 'big hotels, 'comfortable restaurants, clean theatres, luxurious cinemas. 'In short, a successful city, 'a city to be proud of. 'But strangely enough, the Glasgow I generally portray 'lies on the other side of the slow-flowing waters of the Clyde. 'A Glasgow of grey skies, grey buildings, 'depression, 'frustration, 'streets in which the passersâ€”by walk grimly 'on their pre-destined course. 'A course leading through the drabness of poverty to an almost inevitable end. 'And when I escaped to a better world 'i did more than free myself. 'I freed my own then-unborn children. 'Thoughts, even whole sections of my life return to my thoughts. 'A picture, the fall of light on a wall, 'bring back again to memory things long forgot. 'A vase, 'that curtain billowing in the breeze 'brings back to me thoughts out of the past. 'The characters, the people who filled my canvas then. 'That curtain, billowing in the evening breeze, 'a vase, 'those walls... 'Pictu res. 'My enemies. 'My friends. 'Let me remember my friends. 'Peggy. 'Dear, kind Peggy.' hello, Hector. By yourself? 'And Hector. They often chatted together.' aye. I am. At least, I was until you came in. Well, if you don't want to talk to me... - No, you stay. I bore myself to death. Hello, Johnnie. What's up? You look annoyed. Huh? Ach, I've just been trying to draw again. Drawin'. Trying's the word for it. Oh, it's no' bad, Johnnie. No, he cannae. If he falls down... These kids. It's a wonder to me they don't get killed, runnin' about the street, climbin' up on the dykes. And doing acrobatics on top of gravestones in the churchyard! Poor wee devils. They don't get a chance, living in the city. They've never seen the green of the fields or a clear, glowing sunrise. Never seen the sparkle on smooth water. Or the lashing of great sea waves. Not even a clean moon. A moon that doesn't seem smeared wi' the gorbals soot. Poor wee things. I want a piece of bread! One of them's that wee boy up the stair. Yer maw's still out! You're a right lot of wee hooligans! Wait there! I'm hungry! You'll have the whole battalion of them shoutin', Lassie. Bairns. I'll give them a ha'penny each. - You'll ruin yourself. Nonsense! A bit for each of you. Here, Willie! Catch! Willie, son, blow your nose in the paper! It might be daft, Peggy, but sometimes if you didnae see things with a different eye you'd just take a dive off the Jamaica bridge. You were oot late last night. - Me? I had a swell night at the pictures. Yourself? Johnnie, when a woman asks a leading question, the answer is either yes or no. If the answer is yes, you'll say no. She'll always believe the opposite anyway. Eh? I see you're washing your feet, Hector. - It's his head should go under the tap! Ah, none of your cheek. You left greasy papers in the hearth. It attracts rats. I had chips. I'm all for leaving them something to eat on the hearth. If you don't, they'll enter your room and get one of your toes! Johnnie! - Many's the one who has slept with a rat. I'm not referring to you, Hector. If they sleep on your feet and don't tickle your toes, they keep you warm. Ahh, lovely smell coming from your pot, Peggy. I've been promising myself a plate of soup for a while. It puts a heat in you. Would you like some soup, Johnnie? - No, I'd rather have a fish supper. Well, I huvnae got a fish supper. Ach, I'm sorry. Sure, I'll take a plate of your soup. Later. My, you are an untidy boy. Oh, I was just trying to copy the cartoon out of this morning's paper. My, that's clever. It is like it. This is a good one, Hector. I like the one you did of Nora. It's a gift. - That wasn't any good. It's an artist you should be, not a paperboy. Why don't you draw Peggy? I'm no good at drawing faces yet, but I can draw them better than I used to. I wish I could be a real artist. I try, but there's so much to learn. Never you mind. You will be an artist some day. No, I'll no'! I will not, I tell ye! I will not! I'm no' gonnae argue with you, woman. The answer's no. You're a lazy old devil. You know perfectly well it's no' laziness. I'm no' weel. If you're as ill as a' that, you shouldnae be smokin'. Give me that. Smokin' a filthy thing like that. I'll throw it out! Don't! Be careful, you'll break it. - Now what about these sticks? No good breaking that wood. It's damp. You'll make any excuse! How do you expect me to make a fortune for you if you keep interfering? Here am I, working myself to death and you'll no' give me a chance. Get up! - Away you go and don't annoy me! What's up with you two? Joys of married life? He can suit himsel', but if he disnae break the sticks, the fire won't be lit. Now he says the wood's too damp. - I've got some dry wood. I wouldn't encourage him. - It's all right. Jean, if I don't fill up my coupon, I'll be too late. Johnnie, break some of that wood in my room. Inside the fireplace. In your room, Peggy? Yes, Peggy. I've often seen you give this to him, but never seen him drink it. Here. No, I don't feel like it tonight, Peggy. You cannae expect him to drink it - it says to be taken in water! Ach, but there's nae medicine that'll make any difference to that man. The young doctor telt him he was sufferin' frae chronic inertia. Fancy sayin' that! Well, I thought it was a disease. - It is! No' half! It's no good to take medicine on an empty stomach. Have some soup. Would you like some? Well, if it's yours, Peggy. - I've got a wee bit flank mutton in it. Flank mutton, eh? Well, if I've got tae get on with my job, I better have some nourishment. Put on your boots. You're not going to eat at the table with your bare feet! Too lazy to bend down. You're far too good to him, Peggy. - You shouldnae be so hard on him, Jean. It's a marvel! It's generally drink he's after. There. I'll get your soup for you. I'm gey hungry, Peggy. - are you two at it again? They're a pair of warriors, Peggy. - Aye, they're a pair. I never get enough to eat. - Sit doon, you auld slanderer. And leave that alane. It's no' ours. You'd even drink milk. Can I gie him a piece and bread? - Aye, gie him a piece. You drink a' the time, but if I get you a decent meal you never eat it. It's put years on me running to the bin with his leavings. He's so lazy, he'll no' chew his meat! Here, eat that. No! Do you know what he said to me the other night, Peggy? Will I tell them? Aye, go on. Tell them, tell them. - Don't speak wi' your mouth full. I was giein' him his tea. Know what he said to me? He says to me, "Jean, I knew a man and his wife used to wash his face for him." I was only kiddin' the buff out ye. - I'll no' believe that. Don't be daft, Jean. You cannae even wash your ain face! Oh, you can laugh, Hector, but I could tell you things you wouldnae believe. You just wouldnae credit it. - You're a hell of a blether, Jean. Never get tired talkin'? These folk must be fed up listenin' to ye. Oh, no, you're aye worth listening to. You're a right pair of comics. Hector, what are you up to, splashing away? I'm just finishing my smalls, Peggy. I better hang this up in my own room. Maybe see you all later. Ta-ta. Hector! You've left this dirty water in the sink again. Telegram for mrs gilmour! - A telegram? Hey, mrs gilmour! Mrs gilmour! There's a telegram for you! What's all the noise about? - A telegram! Look what you've done. Come on, you shouldnae be up here. Come on, son, down the stairs. - I couldn't find this place anywhere. Does a mrs gilmour live here? - Aye, she does. There's a telegram for her. - I'll take it up. What is it, Johnnie? - A telegram. Maybe somebody's dead. No, no. If you die in the gorbals, they send the police tae tell you. But never mind. No doubt it'll be bad enough news! I'll take it up to her. - I'll come. I'm dyin' tae see her face. What's a' the noise aboot? I was helpin' Johnnie to take a telegram up to mrs gilmour. Never mind the telegram. Pick up those sticks. I didnae drop them. - Never mind. You're a lazy old devil. You'll be in at the fire quick enough when it's lit. Go on, pick them up. Every time that wummin sees me enjoying myself, she's got tae get busy. What did the old woman say, Johnnie? She's not in. I'll give it to her later. - Ach, never mind. Bad news'll keep. Have you seen Ahmed yet, Peggy? - Why? He's got something for me. - What? Oh, nothing. - come on, what's the secret? Well, it's a new razor. About time, too. I've been at you often enough about your chin looking scrubby. From now on, Peggy, there'll be nothing but blood. It's a cutthroat. I'm no' paying for wee bits of tin. At least Ahmed's honest. He's about the only honest pedlar round here. Give him sixpence, you get sixpence's worth. And light the fire, tae. - I'm nae good at iightin' fires! You'd better learn. You're old enough. Look at the mess you're making. Here, gie them to me. I'm quicker daein' it myself. Fancy carryin' sticks in yourjaicket! What a wummin. Hello, Ahmed. - Hello, Johnnie. Have you got my razor? - Oh, yes. Just one minute, I'll get it. Nice scarf. aye. Gloves. Oh, look at that, Johnnie. You're messing up my ties. Oh, just one minute, I'll get it. Here you are. Lovely. Beautiful. Sharp. Cut all the time. Cheap. New, see? No hairs, no rust on it. How much? - How much? Four shillings. Away ye go! three shillings. Don't be daft! - Two shillings? For that?! - Ninepence? Ok. - One shilling to you, Johnnie. Here you are. Thank you, Johnnie. You've been robbed. It's the price 0' a pint. It looks well worth a shilling to me. What are you up to, Johnnie? Here, give that to me. You'll cut yourself. Come on now. It's beside your soap when you want it. What's the tin for? - You always ask questions. For my food. Your what? my food. Is that these wee parcels... - keep your hands out of my case! You always touch these things. It's my dinner. What? - My dinner. Potatoes, curry, onions. Flour for chapati. - Oh, aye? Like the toffs have wi' their dinner, eh? But nae fish supper. Nae wonder you're thin. Look at ye. Legs on you like a couple of woodbines. You darkies take a bit of beating. Half a crown's worth of pepper, a penny of totties and mountains of paper! How do you fancy the queens on Saturday? They should win. How many goes? - Oh, half a crown. You'll get nae half crown aff of me. Och, Jean, look, it's bound tae come up some time. I go about standin' in queues to save a penny and fill your belly and all you think about is fitba' coupons. â™ª I wish I was single again, again I wish I was single again â™ª for when I was single my pockets would jingle â™ª I wish I was single again. â™ª Never mind, Willie. I'll lend you it. It's real decent 0' you, Peggy, but... it widnae be the same. A hard job, mooching a living. Ach, you heathens don't know how to live. Gie me the fella that can take a chance on things. You wi' your wee bag, working your inside out. I use my brains. Anyhow, faint heart never won fair lady. Because my skin is black I'm no good? - Keep the head, Ahmed. He's no' talking about you and magdalene. Willie disnae mean any harm. Sorry, Willie. I no understand. You my friends. No fight. Sure, we're all friends here. There's mrs gilmour. Mrs gilmour? Here's a telegram for you. - A telegram? Is it bad news? Whit's up? Would you mind standing back and letting me read my own telegram? It's from my sister. She's... She's no' well. I'll need to go to falkirk. Is it her legs again? - Aye, I think so. I'll go now. There's plenty of buses. - everything'll be all right here. I hope it will be. Now mind, I'm wantin' no carry-on here. And that goes for everybody. And for you, too, mutrie. See? And as for you, none of your good-hearted business at somebody else's expense. And, Ahmed, don't you be bringing up any of your country brothers here. I'm no' gonnae have my hoose full of darkies the minute my back's turned, even if you dae sleep ten in a bed. Oh, and I might be back early. Maybe the night. See? Peggy makes a grand drop of soup. Can you no' eat like a decent human being? Too damn lazy to come to the table. I cannae. It's all cluttered o'er wi' his rubbish! My food no' rubbish. My food good. Indian food, makes you well. Makes you hot. Hot, eh? All I can say is there must be a lot of people in the gorbals eating Indian food! Take it away, Ahmed. It's gey smelly. Not so smelly as fish and chips and soup. Fish and chips and soup - bah! Eh, can I have a light, Peggy? Oh! You burnt ma finger. Aye, you're a right old devil. You're aye up to some trick or other. Oh, aye, he's aye tryin' his tricks. - Here, have one of these. Give me that. You might at least give me a light. To think that that man actually worked once for two whole months. Bought his ain cigarettes. All he's done since then is put my money on dogs, horses and football coupons. Do you never get tired, scrounging? - Aye, demoralising, I'ntit? Eh, oh, Jean... fitba' coupons. I've got this week's filled up. I telt you I'm not giving you any more. Ach, I'm dafter than you. But mind - I'll not let you forget it. Thank you. Well... I'll just get on my jaicket and go doon to the post office. It's a good thing I understaund her. She's no' a bad sort. Oh, hello, magdalene. I'm sorry to trouble you, but I've raised a wee bit capital for my coupon. I'm short of... - The answer's no. All right, don't shove us. - I don't blame you. Hello, francie. How's the wife? - No' so bad. I just took the kids over to their granny's. Nellie's gey fond of you. Come up as often as you can. - You better come up. Your wife wants you. Aye, right. Coming. Night, magdalene. Eh, magdalene, I hope you didnae think I was tryin' tae scrounge aff you. It was just a temporary loan. - Good night, Willie. Magdalene... Hello, magdalene. - Hello, Peggy. Hello, Ahmed. What's up? Oh... nothing. It's my feet. They're that sore. It's these old shoes, but I'm not going to wear out my good shoes working for no-goods in a cafe. I like it better when my feet hurt, anyway. You cannae go so fast and that annoys them. "Bring this and bring that. Go there and do this. "Are you no' ready with that tea yet, miss?" Och, I'm fair sick of them. For two pins I'd give up this job, too. You're always giving up a job. Have a cigarette. Oh, thanks. - Old gilmour's away. Her sister's bad again. She's away? Thank heavens for that. We'll have some peace at last. I met that Potter fella doon the stair just efter I'd seen two of my... Anyway, he's rumbled old mutrie all right, the old scrounger. That's an awfy room of Potter's and his poor wife. I wouldnae like to have a wean born in it. Here's somebody at the door. - It might be the postman. Maybe it's the parish inspector. - Uh-oh. You'd better go. Oh, and Peggy. I'm out. What are you fiddling with over there, ami? You wait. I'm coming. I show you something. There, magdalene. Oh, they're lovely. Stockings. Long stockings. Lovely stockings. And more. Much more. Now, now, ami. Nane of that. How much are they? For you I make good bargain. - I've told you, there's nothing doing. You no understand? Oh, aye, I understand. I understand you only too well. Now stop your nonsense, ami. How much are these? Ami wants friends. Your friends. This friend. And this friend. And this friend. You understand? I'm no' sure, ami, but do you mean you want tae marry me? I'm stupid. No, ami, you're no' stupid. You're just the wisest man in the whole world. Then you will marry me? - Yes. I told them mrs gilmour's no' in, but I couldnae turn them away. Do you think we could get a place just for a night or two? We've tramped everywhere. You can sit here for a wee while. - It's a hell of a job looking for a room. What's wrong wi' her? - the usual thing. Need you ask? Tramp, tramp, tramping about all day, no place to sleep, not enough to eat. Mrs gilmour's no' gonnae like it. Ah, but you look dead beat. You better lie down for a wee while. Come into my room until you feel better. Thank you. - I get medicine. Make you much better. You bring the case. Come on, dear. I'll show you where to go. Is she ill? - Aye, we have to let her lie down. Ach, there's nothing but illness. My wife's no' well and she asked me to get magdalene. I'll wait if you don't mind. Of course you can. Sit down. I'm worried. It's a pity these things can't be managed a bit better. I don't know what tae do for the best. I just don't know. Women are so stubborn. Have you sent for the doctor? - Aye, he's coming. I wish it was all over. I'm that worried, Peggy. Never mind. She'll be all right. That poor woman is gey ill. They'll need to stay the night. Can I sleep wi' you the night, Peggy? - Of course. You know that. Potter wants you to see his wife. I'm fair sick of it all. I cannae be in two places at once. Why should I? I have my own troubles. - But she's asking for you. Will you no' come up for a bit until the doctor comes? No, I won't. - Of course she will. What do you mean, "of course she will"? Who are you, Peggy Anderson, to tell me what I should do and not do? I'm tired of running to do this and that. I'm tired of running my legs off for other people! You can be a damn fool if you want to, but I'm not doing it any more! I'm tired of them and their illnesses and, "will you do this and do that?" I'm tired of them and I'm tired of their brats that neither they nor anybody else wants! I'm tired...! Oh, I'm sorry, Peggy. Look what I've done. I'm sorry I lost my temper. I'm sorry, francie. Then you will come? Yes. I'll no' be long, Peggy. Will you put out the gas? Of course. Don't I always? Come on, francie. 'I heard about that Thursday night. 'Why do I remember it? 'Ah, it came before that Friday night. 'That dreadful Friday.' I thought you were going to the pictures? No, I don't want to go, really. I like being with you. It's nice being with someone you understand and who understands you. It makes you feel quiet inside. Quiet, as if you had a home of your own. Really your own. Where if you wanted to go away and shut the door, you could keep out the people, even those you love, yet they would understand. It would be so peaceful. Damn nail! I trip over it every time. - You've tripped over it for 10 years. Pity you couldn't knock it in. You'll break your neck because you're too damned lazy. Oh, stop your naggin', woman. Have you any tea? I bought you a fish supper. Aw, Willie. You shouldnae have bothered. Where did you get the money? - Noo, noo, noo. Ask no questions and you'll be told no lies. Where's your manners? - What noo? There's three of us. You can count all right when you're cadgin' money. Oh, don't bother about me. You look after yourself all right, don't you? There. I'll get fat on that - Here, hen. No, really, I couldn't. - You take that. Johnnie will be in soon. We should have left some for him. There'll be nae end tae this. I'll have mine in my room. Oh, that man! You better wash your hands. You've broken the plate now! Sorry. I can pick the chips up. - but you couldnae pick those sticks up. Nag, nag, nag, nag! Hello, Johnnie. - Hello. Good day? - I sold 14 quire. What's that you've got in your hand? just some drawings I did. They're not very good. - Oh, they are. Oh, this one especially. A couple getting married at st John's. - You'd recognise the church anywhere. That reminds me. Magdalene and Ahmed are getting married. No! - Aye, they are. Well, he's been fond of her for a while. It would be nice to be married, if you had a home of your own. If I was a real artist, I would like to paint you. How would you paint me? Like a ballet dancer? - Come here, sit down. How would you paint me, Johnnie? Well... It's all inside me, like music, how I feel. Sometimes, when I'm going down the road for my papers, I think every paper I sell I make a farthing. Every time I think about you, I feel... richer. See some day, if I sold enough papers, I would be well off. I wish I had a real studio. And you to paint. You're daft, Johnnie, but you like me, don't you? Aye, a wee bit. I could get ten girls that don't think I'm daft, but I'm going to weary you all the days of your life until you're an old woman. Are you, Johnnie? - Aye, telling you how much I love you. I love you too, Johnnie. Some day... you'll get that house. And we'll no' live up a close. I'd like a house wi' a garden at the front. You'll get that. Somewhere. Somewhere maybe near, maybe far away. Tell me about it, Johnnie. Well... There's a wee grate. Nora! Nora! You should be ashamed of yourself! - It's all right, ma. Is it? - It was my fault, mrs Reilly. Daring to put your hands on my girl! But ma... - Don't "ma" me! Disgracing us. Your father would have thrashed you. Now mrs Reilly... leave her alone. Nora and me are getting married. You're marrying my Nora? You're daft! What's daft about that? Just wait 'til your da hears about this! now mrs Reilly... Keep your hands off me! Who's knocking my wife about? Nora was sitting on his knee. Aye? And hitting the wife into the bargain, were you, ya dirty coward? What was you doin' with her? It's all right, Peter. Don't hit him. I'm not hurt. I wisnae doin' anything. - I'd batter your brains in! Nora said that she would marry me. You? And my Nora? You marryin' my Nora? You?! Why? What's up wi' me? I'm as good a man as you even if I cannae fight as good. If you've been touchin' my girl, boy, I'm going to kill you! That'll do now, Peter! - shut your big mouth! But... - I said shut your big mouth! Come here. What's going on? - Nothing. What were youse doing? - Not anything. You want to marry this... this nyaff?! Answer me! Leave her alone! - that's the last straw. Oh, da, leave him! You'll only get the jail again! Did you say you wanted to marry him? Answer me! No, I never said I would marry him. Did you think you could live with a... This? Did you? Answer me! No, no! Go on, say it. "I couldn't live with a thing like you." Say it! Say it! I couldn't... - Go on. Live with a thing like you. Go to your bed. You want to be an artist, do you? You'd do better for yourself writin' fairy tales. 'That was the night my spirits nearly broke. 'How long I remained there I don't remember, 'but later that evening I went out from that hated tenement 'and all it stood for. 'I had been shamed in my manhood in front of my girl. 'She, in her turn, in my unâ€”understanding youth, 'had betrayed me. 'Some companionship I badly wanted, 'but most particularly a woman's. 'I wanted to sense the return of my belief in women. 'I was only a newspaper boy, but in my way I groped for beauty. 'III-spoken, ill-informed, the victim of my circumstances, 'with a background which seemed natural to me then - poverty, hunger, 'frustration, depression. 'Mine was not the brief avoidance of my environment through drink. 'I passed the pubs and other places of which I knew. 'I went to where there was something of youthful happiness, 'spontaneous gaiety. It was a dance hall. 'Good band. Rhythm, rhythm. 'Cleanliness. Light. Life. 'Light and colour. 'My search was for... someone. 'Whom, I didn't know. 'But I kept on searching. 'For sympathy, 'affection, 'love. 'She was standing on the balcony. 'She, too, was looking down at the dancers. 'She was slim, young. 'I can't even remember if she really was pretty, 'but I remember well I made her so. 'I was always shy with strangers and at that time very upset. 'Perhaps my approach was clumsy. 'But even now I don't think she need have been so cruel. 'Everything then had overâ€”meaning. 'I was upset still more and so I went out from the light. 'But there was a light on the other side of the road. 'It was the nearest pub. 'I thought to myself, this is what I am a part of. 'This is what I was born to. 'Why should I struggle? 'Why struggle? 'Struggle. 'I'm not sure how long I was there, 'but after a while I couldn't hear very distinctly and couldn't see clearly. 'There were customers. 'And then a man shook me and told me I'd had enough. 'Later, a woman came towards me. 'And mine closed over it like a drowning man clings to a raft. 'I wasn't sure what the face looked like, 'the few times I saw it half-clearly, but it was a woman's face 'and it seemed to be a kind one. 'The voice to me then sounded kind, too. 'And kindness was what I craved. 'There were questions from the woman which I couldn't answer. 'I think now, of course, she must have thought I misled her. 'There was a sudden and hard smack across my face. My vision became clearer. 'Anyway, it sobered me up sufficiently to stagger into the street. 'I wandered into the darkness. 'I couldn't, I wouldn't return to that tenement. 'Friday. 'I couldn't bear the thought 'of that always drunken and horrible Saturday night.' Come on now, Willie. Waken up! Waken up! You cannae sleep a' day and a' night. It's no' natural. The undertaker will take you away. I brought your paper. - I'm no' interested in the paper. You're getting worse and worse. You've to check your football pool. I huvnae got a pencil. - There's your paper, here's your pencil. Come on now, Willie, waken up. Some ne'er-do-well just like you will win the pools one of these days. When mrs Thompson won, old Thompson thought he'd get his hands on it and have a real good time. Instead, she put him in a home for drunks. Serve him right. Are you coming down the road, Willie? Can you not hear me, Willie? Are you coming down the road? Come on, man. Come on. I've still got enough left for two or three drams. Willie, did you no' hear what he said? What's wrong with you, Willie? Can you not hear me? Look at him. I think he's going to faint! Hey, Willie, is... is it the coupon? They're all correct. The coupon's up! He's won! Willie! - Hey! Willie's won the pools! Willie's coupon's up! Peggy! Johnnie! Magdalene! Where are you? Willie's won the pools! His coupon's up! Mrs Clinton! Mrs Clinton! Willie's won the pools! - He's done what? He's done nothing! He's won the pools! His coupon's up! His coupon's up! Tommy! Jeannie! Willie mutrie's coupon's up! Hey, mrs Wilson! Willie mutrie's coupon's up! No! D'ye Ken mutrie's coupon's up? Would you believe it? Mrs whittle! Mrs whittle! Mutrie's coupon's up! Is it? - Aye! Willie mutrie's coupon's up! Willie mutrie's won the pools! Willie mutrie's coupon's up! Congratulations, mutrie! Leave the auld yin alane! You'd think you'd lost a fortune! I huvnae made wan. That's just it. I've lost wan. What are you sayin', Willie? I've been tryin' to tell you, Jean, if only you'd listen. I didnae send ma coupon. I didnae post it. You didnae send it?! Ya wee impostor! Let me in! Are you mad, Willie? I gave you the half crown, same as I always do, didn't I? Aye, you did. You did that, Jean. I bought a pint of beer and fish and chips. I thought I'd gie you a treat. I knew you liked fish and chips. Poor Willie. He's swallowed thousands of pounds. The most expensive fish supper ever eaten in the gorbals. I'm sorry you've been troubled. It's all a mistake. I think you'd better go now. Aye, I think you'd better. No use in upsetting Jean. Come on. Ah, never mind, Willie. You've done it once, you can do it again. A fish supper. Poor Willie. You tried that hard, tae. What a fool I've been. I've ay done everything wrang a' ma life. I've been nae good tae you, Jean. Now, now, Willie. That's no' true. You've no' been so bad. - I'm just a damned old waster. I've cadged aff you and everybody else. Lazy, drunk. And now the one time I could have made it up tae you, what do I go and do? Stop blamin' yourself. What does it matter? Money's no' everything. I've often thought what I would buy for you, Jean. I could have got you a wee hoose and you wouldnae have to stay in a place like this any longer. I could have got you dresses and things. A' the things you've had tae dae withoot because you were tied tae me. I wanted tae take you tae the seaside. We could have had grand times together. I've often thought of that. I used to think aboot it when I was fillin' up ma coupon, although I never told you. I never told you anything. I thought I would win some day. I knew it. And now... See here, Willie. You've got to forget that you ever filled in that coupon. You're no worse off than you were before. Neither am I. You mustn't blame yourself. Remember, I took you for better or for worse. And whatever you are, or whatever you've done, you're ma man. And I love you. And you love me still, don't you, Willie? Aye, Jean, dear. I do that. That's better. Go on, smile. Ach... We'll laugh at this in no time. And we'll still have our holiday. We'll save up for it. Aye. Aye, we'll save up for it. I'll get a job. And I'll work for ye. And you know what I'll do? - What will you do? I'll never drink again. I'll never touch another drop. Willie, don't lie moaning any longer. I'm going down the street. You coming? Well, a wee walk would do me good, if Jean disnae mind. Don't knock me off the bed in your hurry! I'm no' going intae a pub, though. I don't feel like a drink. D'ye mind if I go oot for a wee walk to get some fresh air? I've a headache. You go wi' Hector. A wee walk'll do him good. Aye, sure. We'll just have a wee walk across the green. Poor Willie. He was doin' it all for me. God bless him. Poor Willie. Hey, whit are ye givin' us? All right, all right, we can take a hint! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Gaun, and don't come back! Oh, you're there. You know, Willie, I don't think we're very welcome in that pub. D'ye think we should go hame, Hector? - Ah, no, no. I've still got some money. Oh, right. I'll toss you. Toss you for what? - I don't know. Where are you goin', Hector? - I'm goin' to have a drink. That's no' a pub. Well, here's wan here. - Right, we'll try it. This looks like a more decent pub. We'll go in here and we'll have one. The wine wisnae very good in that place. And I didnae like the look of the barman. No sense of..Hospitality. Eh, Hector, I think I've seen that fella's face before somewhere. Aye, ye have. I telt you to get oot and stay oot! I huvnae been in here the night. Have I? No. And take your hauns off me. Away ye go. Go on. What are ye havin', Hector? - Come on, get oot! Let the auld fella alone. He's doing no harm. All right. But nae trouble. There'll be no trouble if you just keep your mooth shut. Is that right, Hector? - Right. Give us two half pints. And two glesses of wine. Mmm. Stop your singin'! - I'm not singing! It's you singing. Oh, so it is. - Here. My wife sang. Oh, did she? - Aye. I did her. Would you like to hear about it? - Aye, Jimmy, tell him aboot it noo! Tell him the same way as the last time. That was simply grand. There's nothing we like better on seturday night than to hear aboot a good murder. Well, I must have a corpse. Oh, aye, we must have a corpse. Eh... will he dae? Aye. Aye, he'll dae fine. Here. Stand there. Hold your head up higher. Higher, man! You're no' bein' very helpful, are ye? I'm doing my best. - Hector, haud your held up. Take your hat off. I don't like a corpse wi' a hat. No, he disnae like a corpse wi' a hat on. Get your face out of' the way! It pits me off. Oh, go on wi' the murder! Go on. - well... Backwards and forwards, backwards and forwards! I threw her into the corridor. What's the matter now, Jimmy? - It wisnae me. What's wi' you? Hey, listen... C'mon, Hector! It's a wee bit rowdy. I was oot for a quiet drink! I don't want you to get hurt, Hector. My finger! His wife's no' goin' tae be very pleased about that, Hector. What a waste! Here, Hector, shove that in your pocket! - Aye, sure enough. Oh! You know, if we get any more of this, Hector, this fella will lose his licence! Are they in there brawling? I'll get the polis! Hector, what are you doin' doon there? You come wi' me. Oh, come on. Come on, stand on your feet. "I'll never touch another drop." Come on, Willie. Wake up. Wake up! Where's ma tea? I'm not getting up this morning. It's Sunday and I'm gonnae stay in bed. It's no' Sunday. It's no' morning. You've just come from the party. Wake up - it's time to go to bed. Take your clothes off. - aye, all right. You don't half get me muddled up. - Take your clothes off! No husband of mine goes to bed with his clothes on! It's no' decent. Aye, a' right! No peace in this house. I'm going tae keep my pants on. It's cold. Cold?! It's no' cold. There's a thunderstorm comin' up. It's so hot it's a wonder you can sleep. You've even closed the window. A' right, come on tae bed and turn oot the gas. Dr Donald's just arrived. I'm going upstairs to see how mrs Potter's getting on. Aye, a' right. Go on up, but don't make a noise when you come back doon. If I've got tae get up on Monday, I'll need some sleep. How is she now? She must have called out and I never heard her. Why do you always blame yourself, Peggy? There's none of us knew it was so near. She wouldn't go to the hospital. She just wouldn't. The stupidity of it all. Is her husband downstairs? - Aye, he's downstairs. Is she that bad? - Is there nothing you can do, doctor? The hospital or something? The hospital can't help her now. It's too late. Poor francie. Been up to see the wife? How is she? I'll go up and see her, eh? What's wrong? Whit are ye lookin' like that for? I'm sorry, Potter. She didn't awaken. And passed away quietly. Well, I'm tired. I thank you for your help. Bye, Potter. 'And so I returned to that grim place I called home. 'Where I had been, I couldn't remember. 'Perhaps I didn't want to remember. 'Lost. Defeated. 'Degraded. 'Hatred in my heart... '..For everything. 'Everyone.' Hey, father's back! Hey, mother, here's father. He's awful drunk. For them never the green fields, glowing sunrise, smooth water, sea waves. Not even a clean moon. Smeared with the soot of the gorbals. And that Peter Reilly. Oh, if I could only fight him. If I wisnae a wee fella, I would bash him. I would bash him so the blood would pour down his face. I would fix him, all right. I would do him! Johnnie... Where have you been? You never came back last night. What has it got to do wi' you? - Nothing. Nothing at all. Johnnie... Are you drunk? - Aye, I'm drunk. In search of a moon. You've never been like this before. What happened to you? I just took the notion. You think I'm just a wee boy. Well, I'm not! I'm a man! - You're cold and wet. Go to your bed. - leave me alone! I'm a man. And not going to stand any more nonsense! That damned Peter Reilly. He thinks he can get away with it. Him and his daughter. I'll show him. I'll do him. Come on. It's getting ia... Johnnie! Aye, I'm gonnae do him! You're wrong, Johnnie. Wait. He was sorry. He left you this shirt. You expect me to believe that?! - He did, Johnnie, he did. So that's Peter Reilly's shirt, is it? - Yes. I'll do that to Peter Reilly!
