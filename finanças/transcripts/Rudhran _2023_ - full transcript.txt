Ten years ago, Bhoomi was a nobody. Today he has risen to heights demanding 30-40% commission to do business. On seeing him, you will shiver in fear. But I... will slit his throat! People who spoke against Bhoomi have become fed to fish or buried under. How do we believe you, Shankar? It's a problem only if we don't do anything. What if we kill him? You people just say the word... I will kill him! I guarantee your businesses and lives. Brother, Bhoomi is arriving! Sorry, I ran a little late. Why are you standing? Sit down! Shankar, come on, speak up! Come on. I heard your voice as far as my house. Why are you hesitating after seeing me in person? Speak up! How dare you say that you will slit my throat? I'll give you all two options. One: Do business under my mercy. Two: Die by my hands. Now you people decide what suits you best. Why do you care about others death? Instead of issuing a death certificate, you went to the police. Please spare me. Please! Do you think you're the only doctor in this town? Before the news gets out, do you want to see me issuing a death certificate to you? Sasi, brother! Sasi, brother! Sasi, brother! What are you guys waiting for? Bloody hell, go and check who it is? Hey, who the hell are you? Show yourself! [multiple overlapping voices] Who the hell is he? It's Rudhra! [reporter] I'm reporting from the site of murder. Are the forensics here? Sir, this is Sasi. He's a big drug dealer in North Vizag. He's from Bhoomi's gang. Brother! Look what they have done to your brother. Brother... Hey, wake up. Your brother is here. Don't spare anyone who's the reason for my husband's death! Despite the fact he's your brother. They killed him. Brother, don't! Let go, damn it! Hey! In 24 hours, I need to kill the person who killed Sasi. [boys jamming to local folk] Like that. Just hit it! That's right, homie. Drop the beat! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Where is he? He drank and now sleeping. He drank and now sleeping. Hey, shut up! Guys look, the officer got him liquor. - Hey, go from here. Go! If you go to work, who will play with your mother? Like mother like son! Don't peg him to be irresponsible. One day he will take up the entire responsibility of running the family. - Dear... - Yeah! Did you forget? I'm looking because I forgot. Do you know what today is? My headache day! Devaraju! Why are you calling me by name? Did you forget that today's our wedding anniversary? Oh, God, help me! As I lost the document, I was a bit worried... I'm sorry... Please bless me! How do I thank you for putting up with me for so long? - Don't stop dancing. Performance is loading. Oh, God, no! What's this nonsense? What is it? Romancing in broad daylight. Hey, I ought to... Today's our wedding anniversary. So your mother seeks blessings from me. And I was... Understood, it's your wedding anniversary. Let me rip them off. Happy married life! Thank you. I bless that you have sixteen children and live happily. Stay blessed! I love you, dad! Get to the point. What do you want? And how much? You usually pay me 2000 rupees and another 10,000 on top of it. 10,000 rupees for what? It's my parent's anniversary. I need to throw a party for my friends. Hey, this is our anniversary. Why do your friends need a party? We find an excuse every day. Today this is our excuse. Oh, so you use our anniversary as an excuse to party. Dad, come on! Mom... ...there's a lot of mouths to feed. Hey, hey, take your hands off! Even though you know, you keep looking for it. Here it is! You pretend well, dad! Is there anything left in your shirt pocket? Bless and give it to me. Don't scold! - Give it to me! - Enjoy! Aah... thank you! Devaraju... What else do you need? Today's your anniversary. Yes! - I'm heading out. - Okay! You two will be home alone. So romance is in the air... Hey, brat! Is this how you speak to your parents? - He's too much. - Yes, he is! You reminded me about our anniversary. Like our son said... romance... My dear sweetheart! Damn you! Where did the cat go? File, file, file. I was just kidding. I believe you started the romance. I hope I land a job this time. Give your interview properly. Okay! Rudhra! Wow! Wow! Are you Rudhra? Is your name Rudhra? Hey, come closer! Friend! Your name is Rudhra! Mother's name - Indirani. Father's name - Devaraju. You're here for an interview. Am I right? Is she a modern astrologer? You know so much about me. Are you following me on social media? Yes, I'm secretly following you... ...from Gajuwaka signal. If you've been following since Gajuwaka signal, you're bound to have feelings for him. I'm feeling shy. To hell with it! You both were gawking on the road and dropped your file. And now looking for it. Gawking? How would you pass the interview? And land a job. Dude, she's cursing me! Erm... please don't curse him. He's like a kid. Yes! You did not just bring his file but my friend's life. Yes! As you are here, please wish him all the best. As if it's important. - You see... - Madam... ...if a beautiful girl like you wish him all the best even 5th grade flunk will become an accountant. Yes, even a guy from Aamalapuram will go to America. Wrong timing for rhyming. Okay, I dropped it. All the best! She wished you. You could say it with a smile. This is enough. Oh, God, I have fallen for her. Enough, first attend the interview. - Excuse me! - Yes? What question did they ask you? They asked me if I could make soup. Soup you say! Yes, ma'am. Mr. Rudhra! Wait! I'm coming. - Excuse me! - Come in! Good morning sir. Good morning! Good morning, madam. Have a seat. Files! So, tell me about yourself. It's already in the resume. You can read it... So, we need to read it? Sorry, sir. Why is it not opening? My dad's file. I'm holding on to it as a sentiment. Take a look. What are they looking for in my file? This is a rare technology that he has studied. I think he's the right person. Oh, God! He is glaring at me now. I understood! I won't get a job. I'll take my leave. Give me back my file. Rudhra! Please sit down. I said, sit down, Rudhra! You are appointed! Shall we discuss your CTC? I'm going to change the face of IT! Ma'am what's your name? Sangeetha... - And your name? - Sweety! Shall we taste Sweety? " Come and do your flip and dip Lift and dip, Brother! " " Dip down and lift it up " " Like this " " Like that " " And now it looks like something else " " Hit it! " " Oops!

Do you want to hide that you're drunk? Keep it steady and walk straight. Keep it steady and walk straight! Come to the right don't go left. Bless me, mummy! Bless me! My parents are very good people. It's obvious, they're indeed good people. Oh, God, I pity him! Hey, do you want a pillow or a comforter? It's okay, buddy. I'll adjust. It's like my home. - He's very adjusting. - Yes! Hey, you always give him a chance to criticize you. Why don't you join your dad's business? Instead, you say you're job hunting and end up getting drunk. Oh, no! How can you say that we were lurking around? We came straight home. I swear! Don't mind. They won't understand. I agree old people don't understand. If you knew the reason why I'm drunk... he will pour me a drink. How dare you talk to your dad like this? Oh, no, your thighs are exposed! Exposing in your old age? Disgusting! Indirani! Do you know to read English? I found my pocket. Do you know to read English? Never mind. Hello, excuse me! Here you go. Read it! We are steady but he's staggering. That's why you need to drink daily. I can't believe! What is it? He got an appointment order. He got a job. Did you get a job? My dear, son! - Oh, God! - What a changeover! Why do you have to scold him for drinking just one day? Why didn't he mention it earlier? Had I told you whether you would pour me a drink? He would rather have one. Hey, your father is laughing! I know, he's laughing. Awesome! Stop glaring! I'm sorry. Angry bird! Welcome! Welcome! Greetings, sir. Please take your seats. So, tell me, Das... Had it been someone else, I would not have lent six crores. The properties he owns will sum up to three crores. But he demands six crores. I'm lending him money because I trust you. Sir, I never met God. To my family and me, Das is the God. If we are well to do it's because of Das. Hey... What are you saying? I'm telling the truth. Because of your hard work, you're well-to-do. But Das, make sure the interest is paid on time. We will pay off the interest and the entire loan in six months. That's how perfect is our business plan. - Am I right Deva? - Yes! - Sixer! - Yay! That's it! Is Dhoni out? Hey, manager is here. Scoot! It's Dhoni who is playing, you idiot! Manager! Manager! Manager must be gawking at someone. Oh, no, the manager is behind you. Good morning, sir. You look thin. Do you want popcorn? What are you doing Indirani? I'm preparing the grocery list. Hey! - Catch this mummy! - What? What happened? Your antics are over the top. It's because I just got my first month's salary. Did you get your salary? Yes! - Wow! - Come, on. Enough dancing and bless me! Stay blessed my child! Wait, wait, wait! I'll go and stand over there. - Hi! - Greetings ma'am. Greetings! Your husband is pretending as if he did not notice us. Call him! Dear, listen... Please come over here. Can't you see I'm busy? I said, come over here. [humming a song] What is it? Your son is here. I can see that. Ask him to sit. That's enough. Stop it! Your son has received his first month's salary. And he insists on giving it to you first. Hey, give it to him. Give it! First month's salary. Bless me, dad! - Hey, wait! - Stay blessed. Hey, hold this. I knew he will create a scene. - Hold it! - What is it? Give it to me. Mahesh, Govindu, everyone come here. You too stand up. What is he doing? Now say, why are you here? I just said I wanted to give you my salary and take your blessings. You won't lose anything if you repeat it. Do it for you dad. Oh, he expects an audience! I understood. He will say it. I received my first month's salary... I wanted to give it to you and take your blessings... Why do you have to laugh? You won't fall on my feet? I asked, won't you fall on my feet? If not he'll feel bad. Bless me, dad! Das, did you see? You always used to find faults in him. That he's irresponsible, lurking, and invites trouble. You never had faith in him. Uncle, I ought to... I'm going to thrash you. He brought his first month's salary... and came straight to me to get blessings. Uncle, he is lying. I did not give it to him first. I gave it to mom. And she insisted and brought me here. Did anyone ask you the entire story? Come on everyone get back to work. - Hi, uncle. - Hi, dear. That's enough. - Hi, Ma. - Hi, dear. I was out doing wedding shopping with my friend. Oh, shopping! My friend is waiting outside. If you don't mind, shall I invite her too? Dear, you don't have to ask. Please bring her. Ma! This is my friend, Ananya! Hi, dear. Ananya, this is Sakthi, my fiance. Hi... This is Rudhran, Sakthi's best friend. Hi. He's a like a brother to me. Please sit down. Deepika your friend looks like a Goddess. Not like a Goddess. She's a Goddess! My son, Rudhran works in a IT company. He draws a salary of 80,000 rupees. Correct! Hey, eat! He's been working for three years now. Wrong! Shut up and eat! I forgot to tell you all something. Me landing a job, and throwing a party to all of you... she's the reason for it. If not for her, nothing would've been possible. - Oh! - Is it? Have you both met already? Once... Yeah, we are very close... We have met. I have met him, Ma. I met her once. What do you do? I'm a lab technician at Be Well Hospital. Where do you live? Where are your parents? - Right... - Hey! Keep eating! Please go ahead. I lost my parents during childhood. I grew up in an orphanage. Now I am along with Deepika in the hostel. Don't feel sad. We are there for you. I am there too. I meant, we all are there. Don't feel upset that you don't have parents. If God did not bless you with parents... there must be a reason for it. God works in mysterious ways... Hey, hey... That's enough don't sass her too much. Hey, you leave. Go, sit there, and eat! It's okay you continue. I'll sit here and eat. That's more like it. Do you like to have noodles? - No! Okay. - Hmm-Mmm. No! She's not my girl. Where is she? Deepika said that she works here too. Oh, God no! Rudhra! - Hi! - Hi! - Hi, how are you? - I'm good! I can see that. You're doing well. - Very good. - My hand... Oh, oh... I'm sorry. What brings you here? Shopping! Shopping at the hospital? Shopping... I'm here for master check up. For you? No for mother. Is your mother here? No, she's not here. First, I need to know the process... Will it work or not? Then we need to match horoscope charts. All of it should match... What are you talking about? I wanted to know how much it costs to do a master check-up. Bring your mother in the morning on an empty stomach. I'll take care of it. I'll starve her since night. No, no, no, no, no! Hey, what happened? What is it? - This is coffee. - Coffee? Mom, you should not have coffee before a master check-up. You need to be on an empty stomach. When did I say I wanted to do a master check-up? You did not ask. But I am saying so. I am doing well. You think you're well. You're not well. Listen to me. Come along. Hey, the coffee is going to waste. Fine, I'll have the coffee. Oh, no, it's hot! Where are you taking me? You did not let me finish my coffee. Come with me. Don't get angry. Here, go this way. Hi! We're here. Where are you? You wait at the reception. I'll see you there. Bloody torturer! Is this why you brought me here? Yes! Don't disturb! Step aside. - Hi! Welcome, Ma. - Hi! I hope you're on an empty stomach. Since night she's starving. Please come. See who's here! - Sit down. - This guy I say. Why is she shocked to see us? Place your head on it and breathe. - Mom! - What is it? Be careful. You might hurt the machine. All your reports are here. Okay, shall we leave? Get going! My dear, I'll have coffee and wait at the parking lot. You speak all you want and get there soon. Did you have coffee? Yes, I did. - Did you have snacks? - Hmm! Say you did not! I know you did not. Take mom and go have some snacks. - I said, go! - Okay. I think you'll get married before me. Is that a problem to you? Don't make me beat you. Keep moving, dear. What about you mom? I'm leaving, dear. Please come home one day. Oh, God! Sure! She's torturing me! You're very beautiful. You too are beautiful. Now please leave. I need to talk. What is it? Nothing! I'll get straight to the point. Mom invited you home for dinner. Not just one day. I wish to live my life with you. Daughter-in-law to my mother and a wife to me. Shall we get married? Do you want to know more about me? Shall I tell you about myself? Okay? I don't like to smoke or chew tobacco. Occasionally I have a drink. If you don't like it... you can pour some water to my drink, sit and enjoy. Forget about it. I won't promise to say that I will not make you shed a tear. The atrocity I rain, you'll cry your eyes out. But I know how to compensate and make it right. What I am trying to say is... whether you cry or smile I'll be the reason behind it. Did you in love because I took good care of your mother? If that's the reason... I take good care of all my patients. I did not fall for you because you took care of my mother. 'The other day, when I lost' 'my file, I saw you on the road.' 'You went looking for' 'underprivileged children...' 'bought them books and stationery' 'and you found God' 'in their smiling faces.' That is God! And the selfie you took with the kids... Wow! On that day I fell for you... - Phew! That's enough! - Okay! Take your time. Take as much time as you want. I'll wait right here! Think well and reply in two seconds. Take all the time you want. No hurry-- Ananya! - Shush! - Oh, shush! - What? - Ananya... Madam, It'll be great if you give me a reply. I won't give you a reply now. I'll tell you tomorrow... at the wedding. Oh, at the wedding! Greetings, sir. Welcome! Why is she not here yet? Hi! Hi! - Hi! - Hi! Listen, you promised to tell me your decision at the wedding. I said you would tell me your decision at the wedding. - That's why... - Oh! I came well dressed. So that I can match your style. Waiting! I'm here for my friend's reception. Can we talk later? Hey, please listen. - Mom... - How are you, dear? Mom... She made me mumble to myself. Happy married life. Thank you! How about a hug for me? Hey! You see, you're pushing it too far... I go speechless when I see her eyes. Mom, ask her if she loves me or not? I'm very tensed. - She promised to give me a reply today - Do you love him or not? This kid is annoying. Listen, dear... It doesn't matter whether you love each other or not. But I've made up my mind that you're my daughter-in-law. Listen... Mom did she say okay or not? ...please give him a reply soon. People are waiting with gifts to meet us. You're a lousy friend who's worried about gifts more. Miss doe-eyed! Support your bother for once. Speak up! What's wrong with you? He's a poor thing. Please say yes to him. You focus on your wedding. I'll handle him! One minute, Ma. I'll speak to him. Come with me. What do you want? I want you! Okay, take me! One minute. Look, I don't have parents. You will be my all! Will you take good care of me just as you do now? I won't! I will take better care of you. Okay, then I love you! Yay! Mom, she said I love you!

Mom... Mom! BHOOMI! Brother, I interrogated all suspects who could've killed Sasi. One of these three would've killed Sasi. This is Stephen. 'Last week Sasi killed' 'Simon at a fish factory...' he is his brother! Ganga, I agree we planned to kill Sasi. But someone else did it before us. - I did not kill him. - Bloody! How dare you tell me about the plan to kill my brother? Only if we kill him the other two will confess. This is Soundar. 'He's the brother-in-law' 'of the Councilor' 'who filed a' 'complaint against us.' Hey, I did not kill Sasi! If my men knew you brought me here, they'd kill you all. Hey! Bloody, threatening my men to kill! - Guna, Ganga! - Brother. Something is not right. Whoever killed Sasi... is not here. Sharp! Buffaloes, you're wasting time with me. Now that's Bhoomi. He's very sharp! Who is this? Brother, he is Sketch! The man behind is his henchman, Pencil. Yeah, my name is, Pencil. They sell stash against Sasi. Hey, show me his face. Bhoomi, your brothers are not capable of thinking. You! Only you who uses his brain. You are great! My knees are hurting. Shall I stand up? Bhoomi, how do you think they found me? I went to say hi as they enquired about me in my area. They grabbed and brought me here. Would anyone kill your brother and say hi to you? He must've evaded to Bihar or Kashmir. You're a person who plans to execute from where you are. Imagine how powerful he must be because he brought you out to hunt. I don't think the plan was to kill Sasi but you. Sorry, I meant it was you, sir. Give me a day's time! I will bring you the person you're looking for. Trust Sketch! You must think, how will I pull it off? The place where your brother, Sasi got killed... we need to enquire all the menial workers in that area. They won't utter a word to you. Because Sasi died in my area. Only I know how to extract information from them. Brother please hear me out. He may look like a fool. But he has a point. Moreover, he's a local hand. Let's give him a day's time. It will work out. - Ganga, come with me. - Okay! Guna, you stay with him. Okay, brother. Thought as much! Follow me! You're awesome, brother! No one can mess with you! Sketch! Sketch! I was investigating the people at the spot of Sasi's murder. Why is he panting and running? The guy who killed, Sasi. Yeah! Someone saw him! Who is it? He's a Kulfi ice vendor. Did you bring him? Yes, they're bringing him. Where? Why did you bring the cart along with him? If we have liquor and eat Kulfi ice, it gives a fantastic high. - You think so? - Hmm! Learn from him! - Step down. - Push him down. Get lost! Who? Who killed my brother? - Tell me! Tell me! - Hey! Bloody! Don't you know how to deal with a boy? He's young and timid, making his living selling Kulfi. And you are threatening him! My dear savior. Bless me! Stay blessed! Hey, remove your mask! Why are you coughing? I have cold for three days. Cold? If you insist I'll remove-- No, no, social distance! Don't remove your mask. Understood? Wear your mask properly. Don't worry I'm here for you. Okay. Oh, no! Did you see who killed Sasi? How do I know who is Sasi? You're right. How did the killer look? Brother, I saw him... Tell me. ...they were far and it was dark. I could not see both their faces. One guy was tall and another was short. Can you help us make a sketch! If I knew to sketch, I wouldn't be selling Kulfi. Even if I knew how to sketch someone I saw in the dark. What kind of question are you asking? Being smart it is! But you fail to identify a murderer. Sorry brother! Now I cracked the case. Which one? - Hey! - Boss! Boss! What did the murderer say when he stabbed Sasi? If you ask me like this, I can reply. Come on, say it! I'm telling! Say it precisely! The murderer stabbed saying, "Ooh." And Sasi screamed, "Aah." What? The murderer stabbed saying, "Ooh." And Sasi screamed, "Aah." Do you get it? Don't you get it? He's explaining it correctly. Stop it! Hey! Hey, are you trying to mock us? Bloody I'll break your jaw. What did the murderer say when he stabbed Sasi? If you ask me like this, I can reply. You won't beat me right? No I won't! The murderer stabbed saying, "Ooh." And Sasi screamed, "Aah." Bloody, he's ranting the same nonsense! Boss is angry. Sorry, brother. Let go! Let go! Please control him. Let go of me. Do you peg me for a fool? Brother, don't get angry. I'm frightened to look at your eyes. If you keep antagonizing me, I will get angry. Okay! If you show me how the murderer used his weapon... I know how the men in this area use their weapons. I will use it find the killer! How's my idea? Okay, brother. You're genius boss! Awesome idea! You come here and stand opposite him. Give him the weapon. Why are they giving me a weapon? Hold it! I'm scared. What you saw the other day... you should replicate the incident now. Brother, you're a genius! Come on, do it! Before stabbing he spun the weapon like this... I dropped it! Why did you drop it? Hey, hold it right! Even the kids these days handle it well. But you're useless! Sorry... Do it right! Understood? Hey, cheer for him! You should stab him and he should scream. - Come on, stab him! - Come on! He held it like this. Then he spun the weapon. Then he did something and juggled the weapon... and stabbed! Hey! Hey, I told you to pretend to stab him. But you stabbed him for real. What will I say if the police arrive? Hey, you? Hey, it's him! Who do you mean? He's useless! Hey, kill him! Oh, no! Oh, God! Hey, Rudhra! I know you're here to settle the score. Looks like you did not get enough of us. You bloody killed my brother! You'll die by my hands! - Oh, no! - Brother... I thought you were a ice vendor. But you beat everyone and sent them to ICU! You dared to beat up Bhoomi's men and made them eat dust. You seem like a powerful man. Let me join you as an assistant. I know what Bhoomi and his men are up to. It's in your best interest to keep me with you. I don't care a damn. I don't want any trouble! Brother, I won't expose you. I'm leaving from here. Do you know everything about Bhoomi? I know everything! Come with me! Cheers! First peg and first kiss... the taste hits differently. Sir, you left him with us to take care. It's really annoying to take care of him. Who the hell is he? Either he's full tight and high! Or he looks like he lost something. I can even make peace with it. We can't figure out where he's going? The other day he was sitting alone and crying. Sir, one he was completely sloshed! If he keeps this up he'll mess up his health. Why do you guys drink? What kind of question is that? To get high! Do you know why Rudra drinks? To forget his pain. If you guys had the same problem as his... you guys won't even survive for a day. One decision turned his life upside down. It's fate! 'London clients' 'were impressed' 'by your project presentation.' They want you to come to the UK for 4-5 years and develop the project. Are you happy? Sir, I'm happy that the client liked my project. Please don't mind... I don’t' have an interest to go abroad. What's wrong, Rudhra? Many are waiting for this kind of opportunity. If you cooperate, go to the UK and finish this project. Our company's profit will go up by 20% And your salary will be in pounds. Sir, this company, my salary... more than anything to me my parents are paramount. They're getting older. Leaving them alone in old age... does not agree with me. For the sake of the family,' Rudhran rejected' the on-site offer.' But during that' time, a situation' came up where he' 'had to reconsider it.' - Dear! - Das... I've been looking for Das. Listen... What happened to you? I've been noticing you... you have been a little off with our son and me for the past few days. 'When you get a call, you go' 'to an isolated place and speak.' 'You did not come' 'for Sakthi's reception.' What is the problem? There's no problem. At the office... I know you're hiding something from me. Don't lie to me! Am I lying? I'm lying you say! Why should I lie? Why would I lie? - Das cheated us! - Oh, no! - Das, brother? - Yes, dear! Remember we took a loan of six crores to start bus travel. He swindled all of it and evaded. Oh, no! 'His phone has been' 'switched off for a month.' 'I was confused and' 'went over to his house.' 'But he vacated the house.' 'Wherever I went to' 'enquire about Das...' 'no one has a clue where he went.' 'Ethiraj has profusely called me,' 'asking me to pay the first EMI.' 'I used the rotation' 'money to pay the first EMI.' After that... It's not like a small amount... it's six crores to payback. Oh, no! Oh, God, please help. We did not wish harm to anyone. He was an old friend and betrayed me. Please come and sit down. I'm not able to bear it. Please come and sit here. Look... Look at me. I don't know what to do. Your son and me are with you. Please don't worry about it. I can't take it. You're important to us. It's just money. We'll figure it out. Don't tell Rudhran about it. Okay. He does not need to know. I won't tell him. Only now he got a job. What happened? What happened? Give me some water. Here you go! Oh, no! What happened to you? What is happening to you? Tell me what's happening to you? Is it hurting? My chest hurts! Is it hurting? Hey, Rudhra! - Rudhra! - Mom! - Rudhra! - Mom! Oh, no, what's happening to you? Mom! Look at me. Open your eyes and look at me. - Mom! - Hey, Rudhra... Mom, what happened? - Dad! Dad! - I'm afraid! Let's take him to hospital. Mom, where are the car keys? Hurry up! Let's go to the hospital. Dear, please open your eyes and see me. Don't worry. We'll take him to the hospital. Come on, dad, stand up. Come on, dad. Nothing to worry. - Oh, God! - Come on! - Dad! - Be careful. - Dad! - Oh, no, what happened? Oh, no, what's happening? Dad! Dad? Let's take him to the hospital. Dad? Please open your eyes and look. Dad! Dad! What happened to you? Please wake up. Dad! DAD! 'Rudhran was looking for' 'Das, who cheated on his family.' 'On the other hand,' 'Ethiraj threatened' 'Rudhran's mother' 'to repay the loan.' 'To save his family honor' 'and to repay the debt...' 'Rudhran decided to' 'sell the travel business.' Here's your cheque. I'll take my leave. 'Rudhran rejected the on-site' 'offer to go abroad' 'for his family...' 'begged his manager and' 'requested to go abroad.' 'Meanwhile...' Son, who are you? Hey, lock it up. Who are you? Son, ask him not to lock it up. Lock it up! - Hurry up! - Don't lock it up! Please don't lock it up. What are you doing? Don't lock the door. Go and speak to him. Please consider. Son, I beg of you. Don't lock it up. You know to borrow money... Does it feel humiliating? Both you and your son go to the boss and get the key. Everyone board the car. Son, please don't it. - Get lost! - Mom! Look the son has arrived! Hey, don't fight! Rudhran don't do it. Spare him! How dare you lay your hands on my mother? His father took a loan of six crores. It's seven crores now with the interest. He said he would pay me three crores after selling his travel business. Ask him when he will pay the balance of four crores. What do you have to say? Sir, I'm going to London to work. I will get paid five lakhs per month and pay it all to him. Hey, what's with going to London? Mom, everyone is looking. I'll explain later. Why are you afraid? Please don't be afraid. We'll speak at home. Mom, please hear me out! We'll discuss later. Wait I'll ask him. Do you have any proof? One minute, I'll give it to you. This is the offer letter for the job in London. Hey, Ethi, it looks genuine. Agreed it's genuine... But something is not right. He won't stop until I beat him. I need my money back. Sir, this is atrocious! We have agreed to pay him three crores. To pay the balance, he's going abroad, far from family, to make money. How is it fair if he does not agree to it? Sir, he has a point. Stop creating problem and take the money. Okay, I'll agree because you said so. But verbal promise is not enough. Ask them to give it in writing! Mom, please stop. Your son is going abroad to London! You left without saying a word. But he's informing before he leaves. You guys abandon me! I'll die in solitude! - My ill fate! - Mom! Mom, please hear me out! You first hear me out! You should not go abroad. We will sell this house and pay off the debt. We will shift to a small rented house and stay happy. Mom, how can we sell the house? Mom! Mom, we lost jewels, car, travels, and money. If we sell this house... then what's the use of me being the son in this house. Mom, Dad gifted this house to you with love. Let's not sell this house. Hey, explain to her. She does not seem to understand. Mom, shortly after he joined work, he got offered to go abroad. But he rejected the offer! Now he literally begged HR and got the offer. Let me say something... If you ask who's his favorite person in the world, he says, mom. When he agreed to leave you behind to make money... please understand your son. Mom! Hey, Indirani! What happened? You see, yesterday... there was an issue at my place. Police station... They took you to the police station. I know there was an issue. And you agreed to go to London to repay the debt. Am I right? Six years will pass in a blink. This is our family. I will take good care of our mother. You go away with no worries. But before you leave for London, get married to me. Get married and leave. Are you kidding? What's wrong in it? Stop joking around. - Why are you blushing? - Hey! I've got so much on my plate. I don't care! Get married and leave. You go and speak to my mother. I can handle your mother. You're in a hurry, dear. Let's go! Come on! " This time I live with" "you Is enough, girl " " Enough are these days, When" "your smell is palpable, dear " " You’re the blue sky " " What is life without you?

Take your medicines on time. Sleep on time. Okay! If you miss anything, I'll scold you from London. I hope you understood. Don't cry. Please smile and bid me goodbye. - Smile now... - Okay. Stay blessed my, son. Please take care of your health. Okay, mom. - Eat on time. - Okay. Sleep on time. Also, please call everyday. Okay, mom! Okay, now smile! Now that's more like it. Bye! Very good! Bye, mom! Mom... Mom! - Bless me. - Stay blessed. Bye! Don't worry. We'll speak over video call. - No issues at all. - Bye! Ananaya, get inside. I'll be back, mom. Hurry up! Bye, mom! I love you! Look at me. As you're going abroad, please take care of your health. Don't eat out a lot. Cook and eat the stuff mom gave. Sure, sure, sure! If you don't know call me. Smile! Go safe! I love you! Go safe, buddy! I'm leaving! Dear! Brother, I came to deliver water. Hey, everyone sit down! Guna, brother! Sir, Bhoomi has arrived. Guna, brother... Bhoomi, look what they've done. Guna, brother! Bhoomi, why did you come over here? I would've come and met you. Bloody hell! He keeps killing my brothers... and you expect me to be a mere spectator? This vehicle is parked here with no relevance. The killer could be the Kulfi vendor. Is it the Kulfi vendor or someone pretending to be one? The forensics are collecting evidence. We will find him! To hell with them. You don't have to do anything! Someone who knows us... must've killed Sasi and Guna. He's not a gangster or a rowdy. He is one of them. No one should even get the idea of opposing us. How did the muster the courage? Do you have all their fingerprints? Yes, sir! Give these fingerprints to the AC... and ask them to match the fingerprints from Guna's murder site. Sir, one fingerprint matches! Tell me! Bhoomi, one fingerprint matches. Whose is it? Rudhra! Move! - Ganga! - Brother! He reminded me of all the crimes I had committed all these years. No evidence that points to me should be inside this room. Nothing should be present. What is it? Sir, I enquired downstairs. Four boys stayed with Rudhran. All four have absconded. Arya, Rudhran's daughter. Annavaram! Ganga, how far is Annavaram? It'll take two hours. Who do we have there? Bachi, brother! Brother, call from Ganga. - Bachi! "- Tell me, Ganga!" I'm sending you a photo. There are chances he's in Annavaram. At the sight of them, take out both him and her daughter. Brother, please come in. Get inside. Hurry up, come inside. - Who is he? - I'll explain. Dad! Yay! Oh, God! I missed you, dad! Look I got you a new dress. For me? Thank you, dad! Why did you not come last week to meet me? Sorry, dear. Dad was busy with some work, so I could not come over. Does that mean you will spend the week with me? Yes! I will spend it with you. Will you take me out? - Take you out-- - Why? Okay, I'll take you. - Promise? - Promise! Yay! I love you, dad. Dear, look at the mountain. It seems like God is lying on the earth. Hey, why did you uncover my face? - Yay! - That's it. - Dad come with me. - Where? Let's go over there. Wait, I'll get you what you like. Let go! I'll go by myself. Dear! Hurry up! I got the cotton candy. Dear, I got your favorite. Dear, come over here. - Come on, hurry up! - Wow! Cotton candy. Run to me, dear. Arya! Dear, what happened? Dad, it hurts! Hey, don't stand. Scram! Dad, it hurts! Dad don't leave me. Sit down. - I am scared! - Sit down. Dad, don't leave me. Please be with me. - Brother. - Tell me, Bachi. I spotted Rudhran and his daughter. He's at Annavaram temple carnival. Hack down his daughter in front of his eyes. Please don’t leave me here. Please stay right here. What about Rudhran? I will come and kill him. Okay brother. First, kill his daughter! Dad, don't leave me here. Please stay right here, dear. Please stay here for a while. Please, dad don't leave me. Don't go, Dad! Please listen to me. - Don't leave me, dad, - Arya! Do what I say! Hey, don't stand there. Run! Okay, I'm running! Dad, please don't go! Dad... Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! I'm scared! Dad! Dad! Dad, I'm scared! Please save me! Dad, come over here. Dad, come over here. I'm scared, dad! Dad! Hit me! Hit me! Come on, hit me! How can you think of killing a child? Have you ever seen deity Rudhrudu? I am that Rudhrudu! Hello, Bhoomi! Is your head spinning, looking at the dead pile of your men? Bloody... I will hunt you down by tonight. I'm not a wild boar to hunt down. I'm the king of the jungle, Lion! If you mess with me, you'll be doomed, Bhoomi! Hey, don't forget I'm Bhoomi! Hey, I'm the God who created the Bhoomi. Don't you get it? Rudhrudu! Since you elevated your lifestyle, have you forgotten your true identity? I will capture you! I will! That's my daughter. Come here, dear. This is Rudhra. - Hi, brother. - Hi! Hey, are you a murderer? I doubted when I saw your room full of pictures and information. Sir, we even asked you. You certified him as an honest person. What did you tell me? You told us his mother was murdered. But I see him killing everyone. Our area is swarming with the police. If he does not surrender himself, we will get arrested. Hey, stop flipping like a chicken. Aren't you safe here? Do you call this safe? The police think we are partners in crime and looking for us. Look, we came forward to help you... but now you made us run for our lives. You're going overboard. Rudhra, you feed your daughter and put her to bed. Dear, you take him and serve him food. Sure! Take him inside. Sir, you're a police officer helping a murderer. Sir, did you take a bribe or what? Hey! Yes! Rudhra is a murderer! He will continue to kill! Not just today, I will help until my last breath. When the entire police department is looking for him, do you know why I took the risk of bringing him to my house? Because I respect his pure heart. I am not doing this money, my friend. It comes from the heart. Hey, step aside. You too, get moving. - Sir... - Let go! We are doing this for you. Please sit down. Let's talk. Sir, I need to know everything about Rudhra. The police are hunting Rudhra on one side. But you're a police officer, yet helping him. Didn't you say he went abroad? What happened after that? Hi, hi! Do you notice any difference? Difference? You look beautiful as ever. Not that! Okay, fine, I'll give you a clue. Okay, clue. Go ahead. - Doctor! - Doctor? Is it true? Tell me! You're going to be a father. Woohoo! My wife is pregnant. Look at her! Thank you. Listen, you need to have your food on time. It's hurting that you're not with me right now. I miss you! You should not cry in this situation. Smile!

Arya, look at your father! Look at me, dear. Oh, God... Say Hi to dad. - Look here. - Hold her right. Dad is on the phone. Say hi to dad. - Look at her... - Arya! " I feel lonely as you're not" "here to give me company " Hi! - What happened? - Light cold. Did you go to the doctor? It's not cold but fever. It's because he's staying alone over there. Mom, please hear me out. Swear on me. Not a word anymore. Understood? " I get lost in your manes that" "sway gracefully to the wind " " I floated like a" "feather Flew like a leaf " Hi! Yay! " Day Night Summer Winter " " You're my world, my love " Why did you leave mom alone? I'll explain, come with me. Come on. Don't get pissed off. Ananya, mom is not well. How can you leave her alone? She's scolding me that I'm not taking care of you. I thought you'd be happy to see us, but you're pissed. I call mom. You speak to her yourself. Ananya is calling. Here you go! Why did you send Ananya to me? You see, the child... You want me to be happy when you're suffering out there. Listen, she did not do anything wrong. 'Don't get angry and hear me out!' You're thirty-four, yet I can't be away from you. 'She's a child and is not' 'familiar with how her father looks.' Listen, we'll take care of your mother. That's not the case. You hang up and speak to her. "Stop whining!" Mom, don't hang up... " I will hold you in my eyes " " I will shower you" "With unconditional love " " When you blush It" "seams constellation " " I'd listen to you" "speak Like a poetry " " Like a blossom" "from the first rain " " I'd relish your beauty " Grandma!

Daddy... Why do you look upset? What happened? Why did you not let me know about mom's report? You know... Deepika is a fool. Why did she even send it to you? Deepika sending me the report is acceptable. Mom is very weak. I checked the report. I'm afraid! Don't get worked up! This is why I did not tell you. I checked the report. I even consulted with a doctor I know. What did they say? They said, 'There's nothing to worry.' I'll take care of mom. I even booked the ticket. I'll go and take care of mom. What about me? It's festival time, Christmas and New Years are around the corner... there were no tickets. I could get only one business class ticket. Moreover, it's a connecting flight. It's a matter of three months. You take your time and finish your work. Meanwhile all our problems will be over. Fine, how will you travel alone? Don't worry about me. I will take care. I'm eight months pregnant now. Even if I want I can't travel next month. Okay, are you sure nothing is serious with mom? I swear she is fine. Nothing will go wrong. She'll be fine! Because you're with her. That's right I'm there. Thanks. I'll miss you, mom! I'm going to call you every single day I'll take my leave. I want to talk to mom, dad! I'm trying to reach her but am not able to get through. Buddy, please don't mind me asking for a favor. Go ahead! I sent Ananya on her own to India. And now you're telling me? You see... she wanted to surprise mom so I did not say anything. 'She was supposed to call' 'once she reached home.' 'But nothing yet.' I've been trying to call but have been unable to reach her. Please go home and ask her to call me. Okay, I will do it. What is it? He got me doing chores. Ma... Ma! - Ma! - Ma... - Ma! - Ma... Ma? Ma! Ma... Hey, splash water on her. Ma! Please open your eyes. - Ma! - Ananya! Ananya? Ma, what happened to you? Ananya! Hey, there's no pulse. Call the ambulance. Who brought the patient? Sir, it's him. Are you her son? No, doctor. Her son is in London. I'm his friend. How is Ma? Is she doing okay? I'm sorry to say. It's a massive heart attack. Also... it's been 7-8 hours since she passed away. Please inform her son right away. Sorry! Come. Ma... How am I going to convey this news to him? How am I going to convey this news to him? He said Ananya returned to India, though. Sorry, important call. 'Hello, did you go home?' 'Did Ananya reach home?' She-- She did not reach yet. Ananya, did not reach yet? 'Yes!' Perhaps the flight is delayed. She will be there! Listen... [scoffs] you give the phone to mom. Listen, mom-- mom-- mom's not keeping well... What about mom? - Hello? - Mom passed away! Hey! Nothing would've happened to mom. Mom, passed away! Perhaps her blood sugar is high, and she's dizzy. Take mom to the doctor. Speak to him. Brother, mom passed away! Excuse me! One second! Mom...! Oh, God! Doctor, it'll take a couple of days for her son to arrive. No problem! There's a place called William & Co. It's a paid, private mortuary. If the relatives of people settled abroad pass away, until they return from abroad, they have facilities to keep the remains frozen. You can find ambulance drivers outside the hospital. 'Enquire them about William & Co.' 'They will guide you' 'about the process.' Hold on a minute. Sir, William & Co? That's me! We own the company. How can I help? My friend's mother passed away. 'He is abroad. It will take a' 'couple of days for him to arrive.' The doctor suggested approaching a private mortuary. Not an issue. I will handle it. What happened? I'm speaking to him. Who is on the phone? My friend! May I speak to him? Rudhra, the mortuary owner, wants to speak to you. Give him the phone. Greetings! I am Raja! If the relatives of the people settled abroad pass away, I am running a service to complete their last rites. I can understand that you're devastated. Moreover, finding flight tickets will be stressful. Please tell me if you can't make it. I have a package for you. I will relay all the rituals on live HD video with sound. It will be as if you're present here. Sir, give me the phone. If you wish to... Sir, what are you saying? One minute... Sir, what are you saying? He went abroad for his mom. He will come! Hey, what nonsense is he talking about? You don't worry. You come down. Please be gentle when you inform Ananya about mom. - She's pregnant. - Okay. Buddy... Buddy, did Ananya arrive yet? Not yet! Not yet? She left for India two days before me. How come she has yet to arrive? Didn't you say she took a connecting flight? What if it got delayed? I'm afraid because she's pregnant and traveling. Don't be afraid. She'll arrive soon. Let Deepika take your daughter home. We will go and check on your mother. What is the name? Indirani! - Which area? - Marripalem! Box number - 13.

" 'With the pain of' 'losing his mother...' 'and learning about the fact' 'that Ananya is yet to arrive.' 'He enquired everyone,' 'from her friends to colleagues." 'With no idea what to do, he' 'went to file a police complaint.' - What is your name? - Rudhra! Hmm, okay, I'll speak to you later. Sign it! Last month we received a similar missing complaint. Okay, sir. We strenuously looked for a couple of days, but ultimately, he killed his wife. I'm saying this because... At present, the person filing a complaint turns out to be the murderer. Let's go to the commissioner's office to file a complaint. Hey... No matter where you file a complaint it will be forwarded to the local station. I will have to find the missing person and take action. That's my power. Do you understand? He will go to London to have fun. Then he will send back his wife and claim she's missing. After which, he will come and file a complaint. And he expects us to find his wife immediately. Hey, get the vehicle ready. Okay, sir. Sir, sir, sir, please, sir! Hey! Don't you dare touch me! I love my mother dearly. I went to London to pay off the debt. But before I returned from London... my mother passed away. We completed her last rites yesterday. Meanwhile, I don't know what happened to my wife. My wife is eight months pregnant. I'm afraid! I understand. Only you can help us! I beg of you, sir. Hey, don't do it. Please don't fall on my feet. Constable bring me the complaint. It's all a mess. I don't understand. Brother... I observed everything that happened inside. The inspector still does not believe you're telling the truth. The flight ticket is not enough as a proof. Bring anything else if you have. What else? Take my advice. Head straight to the airport. The flight number your wife arrived, passenger list, arrival time... collect all these details and bring it to the inspector. Without an FIR copy, would they give information to the common public? I'll give you a number. Make a note of it. Okay. 'Only after Kalpana' 'referred him did I meet' 'Rudhran for the first' 'time at the airport.' Kalpana madam asked me to meet you. This is for you. Take it back! Not all the policemen are corrupt. Kalpana is like a sister to me. She told me everything. Here are the details. 'Even if we can't watch the' 'CCTV footage from the airport,' 'we could confirm Ananya's' 'name on the' 'passenger arrival list.' 'We checked at the taxi' 'booth if she had hired a taxi.' Sir, did you say Ananya Rudhran? 'We took the number of the' 'taxi driver and contacted him.' That's right, sir. I did pick up the woman you mentioned from the airport. Do you remember where you dropped her? 'Sir, on my way to drop her...' 'the vehicle broke down' 'after I came down the flyover.' 'Later, I helped her hail' 'an auto and sent her away.' Did you note down the auto number? Yes, I did note it down. Sir, let me speak to him. Hold on, the husband wants to talk to you. Sir, greetings. 'Greetings, tell me son.' Sir, where are you? I'm at Gopalapattinam Govt. hospital. Sir, please wait. I'll be over there soon. Please give me a cup of milk. Hello! I stepped out to buy milk for the kid. Come to the milk booth. What color shirt are you wearing? I'm wearing an off-white checked shirt. Great! I spotted you! Brother, please wake up. Brother, look at me. Look at me! Brother, brother, brother... You were going to give me the auto number. Hey! Brother... Hey! Help me lift him up. Where are you going? We might get into trouble. He needs help! You're not supposed to be here. Let's go! Buddy, pull over! 'Two days ago, she messaged' 'about coming to Vizag.' 'What is your name?' 'Did you note down' 'the auto number?' 'Yes, I made a note of it.' 'Brother you were going to' 'give me the auto number.' Stay calm. We have filed a complaint with the police. In the morning, we'll go to the commissioner's office. I know a contact over there. Do you still believe in police? They killed the only witness that could give information about Ananya. Don't you get it? Listen, there's a huge conspiracy at play. Ananya did not go missing on the flight. Something terrible has happened to her. I'm sure hereafter; no one will help us. We should look, find and get the truth out. Do as I say. Call Deepika and ask her to go to your place, not mine. If you repeat it. I will put you behind bars! I'm sparing you because of your wife. I swear I won't repeat it, sir. Step aside. You may leave. 'CCTV footage of' 'him getting dragged' 'by a chain outside' 'the hospital...' The PC from airport is calling. Attend the call. Where are you now? I'm at Gopalapattinam! I'll come to the subway nearby in ten minutes. Can you come over there? Sure, sir! I'll be there. My clothes are stained with blood. Are there clothes in the car? Yes, your suitcase is in the car. - Sir... - Come with me. I know what's on your mind. It's about the taxi driver murder. Yes, sir! It is a modus operandi... that was reported four months ago at Bhemili police station, and that case was dismissed due to lack of evidence. Please share the details of that case with me. His name is Johnny. A notorious criminal. He works for politicians and black money business people. If he's involved in your wife's matter... I am trying to understand if the target is you or your wife. Varadha, brother, I'll call you once the work is done. Why did you kill the cab driver? Someone told me to kill him, so I did. Otherwise, I don't know anything else. Are you sure? I'll confess! Varadha, brother, who is he? Hey, kill him! Where are you now? A factory near Lenkalapalam. Confess! Confess! Confess, I say! Hey, who are you people? Why are you people messing with my life? Tell me! Are you going to confess or...? Come on, confess! I'll confess! I will confess. Come on, confess! Tell me! Who are you people? 'Fifteen years ago in' 'Rajamahendravaram,' 'Bhoomi and I were recidivists' 'serving sentences on and off.' 'It was Lawyer Pandu' 'who used to bail us out.' 'No matter what case it is,' 'the people of that' 'town and nearby' 'come to Pandu' 'sir for legal advice.' Don't worry. Until a lawyer like me exists, truth, justice, and honesty will rot in prison. 'One day that lawyer came' 'to see Bhoomi in prison.' How long have you planned to commit petty crimes? Don't you both have the urge to move to the next level? We have the urge, but not sure what to do next. 'After we got out of prison,' 'we went to meet the lawyer.' 'On that day, he told us' 'something unexpected.' Recently I read the news in the papers. Only a few children who leave behind their old parents to study or work abroad return to show their love and gratitude. But the majority... get lured by the lifestyle and settle down abroad. People over here take that as an advantage... kill the lonely old parents and swindle their wealth. They don't stop there. Before killing them... they take their signatures and transfer the deed in their name. Bhoomi, this is happening all over. 'Pandu got a job for Bhoomi' 'at a most sought-after' 'businessman, Subbiah.' - Sir! - Stay blessed. Did you discuss salary? Sir, I don't need a salary. It's a great honor that I get to work for you. 'Ten years ago, Subbiah's son' 'went to America to' 'pursue education...' 'and married to an' 'American and settled down.' This harvest season will be ten years since you moved abroad. Dad, I'm in a business meeting. Hang up. I'll call you later. Please hear me out-- 'After Bhoomi got' 'acquainted with Subbiah...' 'one day, the lawyer invited' 'us to meet at his house.' Bhoomi, use this injection on the old man's neck. If used this injection, no one would suspect it as murder. When the medicine mixes with blood... he will die of a heart attack and ceased blood circulation but no one will suspect you. Sir, we'll do as you say. Here you go! You are quoting everything for half price. Do you think I'm unaware of the current rate running in real estate? It's a total of fifty acres of land. Fifty acres! Son, don't speak out of turn. You can't go back on it if you speak out of turn. I'm holding your father's will. Do as you, please. Oh, no, what are you doing? Stop gaping and hold his legs. Sir, please don't do it. Hold is legs! You never turned up for your dad's funeral. But came running to get his wealth. Die, you bloody! 'The world of fun is yours...' 'I'm going to have it all!' Thank you, sir. Is one lakh not enough? Here take another lakh. Oh, God! Two lakh rupees. You're too generous. You're wise, sir! You're wise! There's chicken but where's my favorite dish, egg? Please wait, I'll bring it. Get it soon! Eggs, I need eggs. Sir, here are your eggs. Why are you serving from behind? Hey, Bhoomi, what are you doing? Come on, hold his legs. Hey, don't do it. Hey, come on. Hold his legs. 'When he realizes that the' 'lawyer is of no' 'use to him anymore' 'is when Bhoomi' 'shows his true colors.' 'On the day the lawyer' 'suggested this idea...' 'is when Bhoomi decided to' 'defraud Subbiah of his wealth.' 'Bhoomi did not kill' 'Subbiah for lawyer' 'but for him!' Criminal lawyer! Eliminate the lawyer. We'll take the criminal. What will we say to the people? We will tell people he died of a heart attack. Remember, he taught us. Fall on the feet of the Guru and take blessings. Blessings from a dead body? Did you say a dead body? He's the guru who taught us to kill the old parents and swindle their wealth of children who settle abroad. Fall on his feet and take his blessings. Be well! We made so much money by killing just one person. Many have left their parents and settled abroad. All the money on this earth is going to be Bhoomi's. 'If we kill a police officer,' 'another will replace him.' 'So we bribed the Police' 'officer who started' 'to trouble us...' 'and kept him under our control.' 'That's when it all began!' 'A massive property.' 'But Bhoomi's target is' 'lonely old parents of children' 'who cared little about' 'them and settled abroad.' 'He takes their fingerprints,' 'digital signatures,' 'and bank details' 'and forges a' 'document stating they' 'sold the property to' 'him for a lower price.' 'He will show the' 'documents to the' 'children from' 'abroad and cut a deal.' 'The registration will' 'complete in two weeks.' 'Bhoomi formed a strong network.' 'A North Indian client required' 'property in a prime location' 'to start a new Jewelry' 'showroom branch in Vizag.' 'That's why we' 'targeted your house.' 'Local area brokers,' 'vegetable vendors, watchman,' 'laundry, and handyman.' 'We used these people' 'to follow our targets.' Bye, Mom! Tell me! Did you eat? Don't lie to me! You were hale and healthy when you were in India. But yesterday, in the video, I saw you'd lost weight. Don't mind. I'll be back in three months. Listen, an important surprise is awaited. Surprise? What kind of surprise? You continue watching TV. I'll make a video call in ten minutes. Hey, tell me what it is. Who is it? Who is it? Shall we make a video call? Pick up the call mom! Was it you people... who killed my mother? So, that means she did not die of a heart attack. You people killed my mother! Hey! Hey, let go! Hey, don't do it. Let go of me! Please hear me out! Don't do it! Hey, let go of me! Hey, don't do it! Don't kill him! Why did you kill my mother? If he dies, we won't know what happened to Ananya. Hey, Rudhra! Hey, hey, hey... Hey, wake up! Hey, wake up! Wake up. Tell me where's Ananya? Hey! Hey! I told you. You never listened. He died! Hey, please speak up! Hey, speak up! Hey, Rudhra! Hey, don't kill him! Varadha! Varadha, look, I'm here. Hey, kill that man! Don't do it! Kill him! Let go of my friend... My friend... I pegged you to be like other people who settle down abroad. That was my first mistake. Do you know what gives you high than cigarettes and liquor? Money! If you think of making money through honest means... you'd be doomed! Only I can stop myself from committing the crime I commit. I thought no one would dare find me. But you did! Do you think you can take me down? Do you know how many injections and deaths built this empire? You came looking for your wife. Do you know what happened to your wife? Ganga, a woman, is coming toward the house. What do we do now? Hurry up! Clear everything. Take her fingerprints! Take out the laptop. Enough, everyone go and hide. Switch off lights. Come on, hurry up! I flew over seven seas to surprise you. But you are watching TV and dozing off. Mom... Mom! Mom... Mom... Mom... can you hear me? Mom, look, I'm here! Mom, can you hear me? I'm sure you're alright. Please look at me. Please talk to me. Oh, God! Mom! What do I tell your son? Hey, she's calling someone! Mom... Hey! Hey, kill her! - Hey, wait! - Hey! Without consulting Bhoomi, don't do anything. Tell me, Varadha! A girl walked in where we came to kill the old woman. We hit her. I think she's the daughter-in-law. Is she alive or dead? She is still alive. What do we do, Bhoomi? That house is important. Kill that girl! Don't leave any evidence. She's pregnant, Bhoomi. Do as I say, Varadha. Who are you, people? Why did you come to my house? Why did you kill my mother? I don't know! But my husband will come for you people. He will find out everything. On that day, he will wipe out everyone. Dear, even if your husband comes looking for me... I will be the last person he will see before he dies. Hey, give her the injection! Don't do it. Please don't! Please don't kill my child. I don't have parents. You will be my everything. Like always, will you take care of me? Ananya... Your wife did say that you'd come looking. And I told her that I would send you to her. Pour petrol across the factory. Don't spare a corner. After it's burned down, the police should not find any trace of evidence. Okay, brother! Hey, don't spare any corner. Rudhra! Hey, Rudhra! Rudhra! Rudhra! Hey! Hey! Rudhra, get up! Bad things should not happen in anyone's life... it all occurred in Rudhra's life! Look at this girl. What was her fault? At such a young age, she's a widow and has lost her life. Bhoomi's greed is the reason for all of it. Only he has to live well, and others have to die! It's not wrong to kill him! 'That's why Rudhra collected' 'information on Bhoomi.' 'He hunted down his' 'companions one by one.' Now tell me, what Rudhra did is wrong? Brother! Hey, what are you doing? Brother, please forgive us! Brother, I'm sorry! These guys did not know anything and spoke out of turn. I will apologize on their behalf. You know I don't cry no matter how much it hurts. I always keep smiling. After listening to your story, I could not stop crying. Let's wipe out Bhoomi's family without a trace. Hereafter, no parents should die because of them. A man responsible for a mother to shed tears does not deserve to live. My husband, your mother, Ananya, their pain while dying Bhoomi should endure 100 times their pain. Rudhra, it's your mother's blessing that has kept you alive. History is proof that mother's blessing has never failed. When he decided to kill a child... Bhoomi does not deserve to live. Get down and strike him! Rudhra's Wrath! Give me the phone! Tell me, Ganga. 'Brother, Rudhra is at' 'Kala Bhairava temple.' I will kill him and build a tomb for him at that temple.

'Happy Senior Citizen's Day to all.' Among the children who neglect to take care of their parents... is a person who is taking care of many parents as his own. On behalf of Senior Citizen Welfare... we are proud and glad to present the award of Youth Icon to the Chairman of Indira Foundation, Rudhra. Mr. Rudhra, please come on the stage. The award will be presented by Vizag Deputy Commissioner, Sathyamoorthy. - Congrats! - Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you so much. Hey, sit down! Greetings to one and all. The main reason how I could expose such a heinous crime... is Narasimhan. And I extend my gratitude to him. My friend's wife who took care of my child as her own... I extend my gratitude to her. My mother, my wife, my unborn child and my friend... When I lost everyone... the life felt meaningless. Only after that I decided... no one should endure what my mother endured. I started a foundation under my mother's name. In that foundation... I'm a son to many mothers. I see my mother's face in all of them. For God's sake... Please don't leave your parents at an orphanage. After abandoning them at an orphanage, no matter how many Gods you pray to you won't be blessed! Not just abandoning at orphanage is wrong. Despite being home, you don't respect your parents as much as your mobile phone. We don't spare five minutes to speak with them. You don't realize the worth of your parents when they're around you. I realize because I lost them. Please take care of your parents. Thank you! If today my daughter is getting married... it's only because of Das. In four months, we'll return the loan along with interest. Is that okay? " Is this a new avatar' 'of sacred bond?
