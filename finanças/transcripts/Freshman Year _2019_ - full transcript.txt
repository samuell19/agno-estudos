[upbeat music plays] [man] As we go out into the world, let us hold close to words of James and his epistle. Chapter one verses two through four. Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete not lacking anything. [audience clapping] Let us all give thanks today to God and our families for being by our sides throughout high school, as we work towards our goals for the future. Whatever they may be. I'd like to start by thanking my mom, who for the past four years, has spent countless hours on the road, making sure I make it to school on time in the mornings. And also picking me up from basketball practices and games. Thank you, Mom, I love you. [audience clapping] I've been fortunate enough to be raised in a multi-cultural home with a strict Nigerian father and an American mom. My dad has helped set boundaries and discipline that has carried me thus far. He's my mentor. My hero. To my father. I say thank you. I love you, Dad. [audience clapping] To the class of 2019. It is time for us to put into practice what has been poured into our lives for the past four years. In the great words of Jesus, we are the salt of the earth, and the light of the world. So let your light shine and make a difference. Class of 2019, are you ready?

[coughs] [clears throat] Um, thanks for the invite, but my church is actually throwing me a party afterwards. [laughs] Okay. Have fun at church. - Pray for us. - Bye. Good job, son. Do you think you made the right choice about college? Honey, we already talked about this. We trained him up. We raised him up right. I'm just saying it's not too late to change his mind. I can still pull some strings at ORU. Well, Dad, remember my speech when I said I wanted to spread my light and make a difference? I just feel like the best place to do that is at a public university. Son, I believe you made the right choice. Don't worry about your father.

In the coming weeks, uh, I'm going to introduce a series of sermons called, "Why I believe the Bible." As parents we need to ground our children in the word. Just before they go out there into the big wide world to start the next phase of their lives. [singing in foreign language] [CJ] That speech was really hard to memorize honestly. [girl] It was good though. It was good. Hey, What kind of meat is this? It's goat meat. We eat it on special occasions. Nah, I'm good. I don't eat goat. Don't know what you're missing out on.

So what do you think about the school? Man, I hear the girls here are hot. No, no, no, not the girls. I mean, you know, the college life. The teachers. Oh, my bad. You don't like girls? Are you? Oh, no, no. I just wanna focus on the Lord and school. The Lord? Bet. This is gonna be an interesting school year. [upbeat music plays] Watch it. I'm so sorry. Here, let me get that for you. Well at least you didn't get it on my clothes. That would be a different story. Like I said, I am so... [gentle music plays] Hey. Welcome to Social Science 101. I'm expecting that all of you have read your course syllabus and outline. This class will not be difficult if you read in advance of every class. I like for my classes to be interactive. Every week there will be a quiz. You will have two mid terms, one final, and a team project to turn in. So, today we'll be focusing on evolution. How did we get here? How many of you have read the first two chapters? Okay. I cannot emphasize this enough. If you want to pass this class, you must read in advance. Now, who wants to address how we got here as humans? Young man in the tie. Me? Yes, you. [clears throat] Um, well. According to Genesis 1:1, in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. A few verses later... Young man, if you wanna pass this class, you must follow the assigned text, not some... fables. How 'bout you? According to the textbook, the earth was formed about 4.5 billion years ago due to an internal combustion caused by a supernova. Very good try and a good start. For your information, we're talking about the evolution of life on this planet, not some magical garden of Eden. Now that's how you should respond in my class. In my class, you need to know this book not the Bible. In my class, this is the Bible. Know this Bible. [soft music plays] Hi, you work here? Can I help you with something? Oh. Actually yeah, uh, a book on evolution. Trying to get a head start on my classes. What you said in there, standing up for your faith, that was pretty bold. Thanks. Honestly I didn't really feel like I had a choice. I'm CJ. Marcella. I remember spilled latte, CJ. [laughs] Do you know where these are? Actually this is my first time here. Come on, I'll give you a tour. [soft music plays] So, how did you start working at the library? It's just part time. It's for a work study program. I'm on partial scholarship so I still need to find a real job, too. [chuckles] Well you're probably be seeing a lot more of me around here. This social science class is really hard. I'm thinking I'm gonna need a lot of extra reading. Don't give up so soon. Nah, I won't. It's just I don't wanna fail the class by butting heads with Professor Thompson, you know. At the same time, I need to stay true to my beliefs. Smart guy like you will find a way to pass and stay true. Thanks for the vote of confidence. Probably shouldn't mention Adam and Eve on my next term paper though, huh? [both laugh] [student] Shh. Okay so here we are. If you have any questions, let me know. Okay. Um, I was thinking, you know. If you need a study partner, maybe we can meet up over coffee? I still owe you that latte. Thanks. I'll think about it. College is really different than high school. I mean, people just dress any type of way and some of 'em curse. That's what you expect in the real world. Yeah. And the professor wasn't too respectful of our faith either. He's talking like there was no God. That's the public system for you. Hey, boo. How's school going? Hey, Mom. I was just telling dad how different it is here. I know. That's not a bad thing, right? Now you get a taste of the real world. Yeah, definitely getting that. Hey also remember to use your new environment as an opportunity to make a difference for God. Are you making any friends? Yeah. One definitely comes to mind. She's really nice. She? Hey, Shawnte in the house. Hey big welcome party tonight. You in? What? Party? What party? Oh, my bad. I didn't mean to interrupt. Hey mom, I'll talk to you guys later okay. Bye boo. We love you. Bye. [Chukwumah] Did he say party? Uh, Well study party. You missing home already? Nope. They're just calling me, checking up on me. Making sure I'm settling in. [scoffs] You're lucky. My folks haven't checked on me since school started. So what are you doing tonight? Hmm... Why what's up? There's several parties by different fraternities and sororities. It's a welcome night. I figure we go check them out. Bounce from house to house. You feel me, bro? I don't know, Shawnte. I mean, basketball tryouts are in the morning and I was thinking about going to bed early and also I wanted to swing by some of the Bible study groups, so. What? Bible study? Man, sometimes you make me wonder. Dude, it's just one night out of the school year. These welcome parties are done once a year. Like you can't afford to miss this. Besides, the basketball team only picks like one or two freshman every year, but I know some of the players. They'll be at the parties tonight. I could hook you up if you really wanna get in. Hmm. All right. - Okay, I'm in. - Yeah. Just one word of advice if we're gonna hang together. You need to dress like a college student, not a professor. You know it'll be you, Marcella. Me? Uh, yeah. I've seen those frat guys checking you out. Okay, I thought we were talking about who will get asked to dance first. I think those frat guys have something else in mind other than just dancing. Well they can say what they want, but they don't always get it. I just hope this party's not full of lame freshman. Okay? Give me a sophomore any day. [all laugh] Hey, we're lame freshman. You know what I mean, okay. I wanna meet a man. Not some boy that's still learning how to shave. - [laughs] - Cheers to that.

Whoo! [all laugh] All right ladies, practice is over. Roger, I didn't hear you sneak up behind me. Relax. I didn't mean to creep up on you like that. But man, seeing you in this cheerleading uniform. Whew. Got me speechless. So what are you doing? Where you going after this? Hey. Hey. Are you coming with us or? Um, no, I'm gonna put my shoes on and take my time packing my stuff. - Okay, that's cool. - We'll see you later. - I'll catch up to you. - Yeah, okay. Hey, Marcella. Hey, CJ. You're quite something on the court. [CJ] Oh, yeah? Yeah. I'm glad you got on the team because now I'll get to cheer you on officially. [laughs] Well I like the sound of that. So, where'd you disappear to at the party? I looked for you but I guess you left. Well you know, I had to get my beauty sleep for the big tryout. [both laugh] Well it looks like it paid off. Thanks. You know it's kind of hard to talk to people at those parties. I didn't know guys go to parties to talk. - [chuckles] - Well yeah. Actually I wanted to talk to you. I mean, I still owe you that coffee. Maybe we could meet up and study together. Study huh? Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that. Okay. Cool. I'll see you then. Bye. [upbeat music plays] What? [Marcella] Seriously? You brought a laptop on a date? Oh. I thought this was a study date. I-I wasn't sure. That's what I like about you, CJ. You're a nice guy. Oh, I know what that's code for. We're just gonna be friends, huh? No. I mean, yes we're friends. I can just tell that you haven't been out with many girls before. It's cute. [cashier] CJ. One second. Hey. Cute, huh? Now I know I'm in the friend zone. [laughs] Don't count yourself out just yet. Okay well, uh, friends know more about each other. Things like... do you have any brothers or sisters? I have a younger brother and a younger sister. You? Older brother. Ooh. Older brother? I guess he'd probably try to beat me up for sitting here talking to you, huh? Probably. He's the overprotective type. Do I need to watch my back? [laughs] Don't worry. I'll give you a heads up if he's behind you. You know, so you can duck in time. [both laugh] Thanks, I guess. What about the rest of your family? Um... [clears throat] Dad left when I was little. So it's just my mom. She raised us. Oh, I'm so sorry 'bout that. How 'bout you? Well, my mom's an attorney and my dad's a pastor. A pastor? Oh, wow. So you go by it honestly? What you said in class. Oh. Well yeah. Well that's the way I was raised. Um, my dad says I'm a miracle child. Miracle child? What's that? Well, you see. When my mom was pregnant with me, the doctor ran some tests and determined that I was gonna be born with some birth defects. Um, Well the doctor had told my mom that she should probably terminate the pregnancy, but my dad made a vow with God that if I was born healthy with no birth defects, that he would serve Him or the rest of his life. That's what he did. So growing up my mom and dad never drank alcohol and I went to a Christian private school and, uh, I never drank or smoked either. I like that. I mean, I respect it. It's not easy to avoid alcohol as a teen, especially here when it's part of the college lifestyle. Yeah, you got that right. You really are one of the good ones. [chuckles] Is that so? Well I guess we're gonna be best of friends then. Well friends hang out together, don't they? Yeah, that's right. I wish I could stay longer, but I've gotta get ready for work. It's okay. I'll just talk to you later in class. This was really... Nice. [chuckles] Bye. Bye. [sighs] Come on, CJ. Why didn't you kiss her, man? Ugh. Come on. [exhales] There go your girl. Now I really got an appetite. You gonna serve us, baby girl? You again. You're not following me, are you? In that uniform, I'd follow you anywhere you wanna go. Well, I won't be wearing it for long if you get me fired on my first night. So, are you guys gonna order or not? Uh, yeah, I'll have, uh, a fried chicken sandwich and some french fries. And I'll have a milkshake. In a bottle, please. And I'll take a burger with the works on it, some onion rings and your phone number. Coming right up. Everything... except the phone number. That's not on the menu. oh, burn. Mic drop. It was a great night today and I thank you for all your help. Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow.

[Chukwumah] For a righteous man may fall seven times and rise again, but the wicked shall fall by calamity. [congregation] Amen. This verse tells us that we serve a God of second chances. Moses was a murderer, yet God used him. Paul was a prisoner, yet God used him. David was an adulterer, yet God used him. I'm not a perfect man. I have a past. Yet God has used me. Many years ago I got down on my knees and I said, "God if you're real, show yourself in my situation." And he did. I believe because I've experienced the God of the Bible. He's real. The Bible is not just a book. It's the living word of God. So in the coming weeks I will challenge your faith for the answer to why you believe in the Bible. So whatever you've done, whoever you are, God can use you. Nothing should hold you back from serving him. [congregation clapping] [Shawnte] Come on. - What you doing? - I see you okay. Look, you got pretty handles. You gonna make it though? - You gonna make it? - Am I? Huh? - I show you why they call me Happy Feet. - Are you ready? Yeah I'm ready. Woo! What, what was that? Huh, huh, what? Okay, that's what I thought. Let's see what you got. That's it right there. That's why. [CJ] That's it? Yeah, all right ready? - All right, I'm ready. - Ready? I'm ready.

All right, well. - [CJ] That's the way it is. - [Shawnte] Whatever man. I'll give it to you. [CJ] I need to teach you how to shoot. Okay, okay. I was doing the most a little bit, man.

Did you score? Yeah, looks like she gave you a fat lip, huh. [Roger] I did score, fool. It's what she wanted and I gave it to her. [student] Bro, that's what's up. Man, she can kiss. She bit me so hard on my lip, thought she was gonna chew off my face. [laughs] And that pretty little uniform of hers was on the floor faster than you can say, "Big Papa". - You know what I mean? - [all laugh] Hey. Take that back. What do you want? Don't ever talk about Marcella like that. I swear. Or you'll what, huh? Hey, hey. Come on, man. What are you gonna do, church boy? Marcella would never talk to an idiot like you.

I stopped it before it went too far. [exhales] He was running his mouth in the locker room and... I was worried about you. [gentle music plays] I care about you more than just a friend.

Here you go, sister. I got one for you, too. There she is with the man of the hour. Can we get three beers, please? [upbeat music plays] You guys ready? [all] Team drip. Team drip. [upbeat music plays] - Are you gonna be okay? - Yes. All right, we'll see you later. Bye. [groans] I think I had too much. [laughs] For your first time drinking, yeah. I'd say you had a little too much. Why's the sidewalk moving? It's not but we are. Come on. My dorm room's closer. Are you drunk, too? [chuckles] I'd say you had a little too much for the both of us. Oh. I like you. You know that? I figured. [retching] I got some on my shoes, my pants. Okay, come on. [spits] [sighs] Thanks for letting me use your toothbrush. I didn't really want you to have that. So, no thanks. CJ. Oh. Wow. Why don't you hop in the shower and I'll go find you some shorts and a tee shirt that you can borrow? Sorry 'bout your clothes. I didn't mean to get them dirty. It's okay. I'll just throw it in the wash. [gentle music] You know, you can join me if you want. [gentle music] Hey man, where you been? Don't tell me you been celebrating all this time. Nowhere. Around. Around? What, you ain't crashing here no more? Oh, I've seen that look before. I know you been up late. Studying. Studying with your study partner? I bet. What she teach you? Come on, Shawnte, don't talk about her like that. It's cool. You into her, I get it. You know we're together now, right? Together. Man, you work fast. Yeah, I don't know. I think she's the one. The one. I love her. Man, don't be saying that crazy love stuff around the ladies. That's how you'll scare them off. Yeah but I thought they liked that kind of stuff. You know, like guys pouring their hearts out. Nah, I mean, maybe if you're down on one knee. Yeah, sure. But this is college, man. There's plenty females on campus waiting to know the new star player. You feel me, man? Yeah. I guess. [sighs] 6 WEEKS LATER CJ, your grades are slipping. Without some sort of divine intervention, you're in danger of failing this class. You need to take your attention off of winning games and girls and focus on passing classes. [soft music plays] Hey, Marcella. Wait up. [vomiting] [soft music plays] Hey, Marcella. What's up? You just ran away from me. Sorry, CJ. Just wasn't feeling very well. You look sick. You're really pale. Must've been something I ate. Okay well, let me walk you back to your dorm so you can lay down and rest, okay. You took care of me when I was sick. Now it's my turn. Okay? [soft music plays] Geez Marcella, you don't look so good. [Marcella] I don't feel so good either. I hope it's not that freshman flu going around. No, I probably just ate something bad. You nauseous? Yeah, I was feeling like this yesterday morning as well. What? What is it? Have you thought about you know a pregnancy test? No, but. That's not. You two wait here. I'll be back in a minute. [soft music plays] [CJ] I don't know what I'd do. It's fine. We'll figure it out together. Marcella? [soft music plays] Are you okay? [sighs] I'm pregnant. You're pregnant? Oh, Marcella. Who's the father? You are, idiot. I've never been with anyone like that. Oh, my dad's gonna beat the devil out of me. Yeah and when he's through with you, my brother's gonna kill you. Why? Why? Why me? What are we gonna do? What about school? What about everything? [sighs] Maybe I should just get rid of it. An abortion? I'm gonna take a walk and let you guys handle this privately. You wanna keep it, CJ? Why am I not surprised? You're just doing what you always do. Being the nice guy. Look Marcella, whatever you decide to do, whether you keep it or not, I'll be there for you and the baby. Don't call it that. [CJ] What? It's not a baby yet. Marcella, you know an abortion is against the Bible. It's a sin. It wasn't a sin when you invited me to come in the shower with you. Look, that's good for you, but you're not the one that's gonna be stuck with it. What you think I'm just gonna leave you by yourself to take care of it alone? We did this together. This is our responsibility. Well I'm not gonna let us ruin our lives. And let's remember it's my body that's gonna be turning into an apartment. So excuse me if I wanna think about it a little longer. Okay. Okay. Maybe we just need to cool off. Yeah. Why don't you go take a shower seeing that that worked out very well the last time. [soft music plays] What am I gonna tell my parents? Winter break's coming up. Perfect timing when the family's altogether. You really think now's the time for jokes? I'm being serious. What about your mom? You're not worried about telling your mom? [sighs] She's not gonna be mad? Maybe. I don't know. [crying] [soft music plays] ♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ Hey, hey, hey ♪ ♪ Hey, hey, hey... ♪ Hey, CJ. Hey. Peter. Hey CJ, you're home. What's up, man? I missed you guys. Missed you too. Oh, I missed you. Hmm. You're so slim. Let's go eat. [CJ laughs] Oh, I got him, I got him. He's down. - He's down. - Oh, people behind us, - people behind us. - Oh, snap. Okay I got him. All right, I knocked one. [phone buzzing] CJ, what is this? Who's Marcella? Are you guys gonna have a baby? What are you doing? Give me that. Are you going to be a dad? Give me that. Keep it down, okay. It's not what you guys think. Dad is gonna kill you. Not if you be quiet. What is going on? Who's killing who? Nothing, Mom. Yes, there is. Monica, keep out of this. I'm your mother. I know when something's wrong. It's nothing, Mom. It's nothing. Hmm-hmm. I ain't no fool. I've seen my share of liars in the courtroom. I can tell when you're not telling the truth. [pouring water] Did you get a girl pregnant at school? [CJ] How did you? Oh, Lord. [soft music plays] Just. Mom, I don't know what to do. I know I let you down. I let dad down. I let God down. I let myself down. Are you sure she's pregnant? Well she took the test and it came back positive and she told me I was the only guy she's ever been with like that. Okay, this is too much for me. You're gonna need to talk to your father. Well can't you tell him for me? No. I think it'll sound better coming directly from you, CJ. Well, can you at least give him a hint or something? Boy, no. [sighs] [hand knocking] You may enter. Morning, Dad. I made you some coffee just the way you like it and I brought you a bagel with some cream cheese. Thanks, son. What's going on? Oh, nothing, Dad. I just wanted to show you how grateful I am to have you as a dad. I didn't want to wait 'til Father's Day. [laughs] Why do I have a feeling something's wrong? No. Uh, everything is... okay. Sort of. So how's school? Still read your Bible? Yes sir. Making any friends? Yeah. Actually I... have a girlfriend. I kind of wanted us to have a father son talk. You know how the Bible says that children are a blessing from God? Yes. Go on. Okay, I wanna start off by saying that I apologize that I messed up, Dad. What are you trying to say, CJ? And? Out with it. Say it! I got my girlfriend pregnant. Dad? You're just not gonna say anything? [deep sigh] [quietly] Go. We should've sent him to a Christian university. We let him decide, Chukwumah. It doesn't matter. Girls get pregnant at Christian schools, too. I should never have listened to you. You wanted him to be a man and face the real world. Well you now have your wish. The world is slapping him across the face. [soft music plays] Look, what's done is done. What will people think about our parenting skills? Oh, Pastor's son gets girl pregnant in his freshman year. I am not ready to become a grandmother. We've been so busy taking care of others and their problems, we neglected to take care of our own. You know? She doesn't have to have the baby. I can't believe we're even discussing this. There's no ifs or buts about it. Abortion is out of the question. Okay, I'm just trying to be practical. I mean, what if she decides to have an abortion? What can we do about it? It's her choice. [sighs] Good point. I didn't think of that. But we have to figure this out. This is delicate. They can get married. Become a family. Many people make the mistake of getting married just because they had a baby together. Marriage is a sacred commitment. 'Til death do you part. Well married or not, we can help him look after her and the baby. Yeah, but we'll have to have some ground rules. I know they've already been intimate, but I can't have sin under my roof. Or like you said, "What's done is done." A man shall reap what he sows. CJ will have to face the consequences of his actions, but as parents the best thing we can do is to support them through the process. Yes. You know. I'm sorry I shouted at you earlier. Thank you. Forgiven? Yeah. [Chukwumah] Who's doing today's devotion? CJ should as he needs the Lord more than all of us. That's not nice, Monica. Yeah come on, that's not fair. We do it everyday with mom and dad while you're at school. She has a point, CJ. It's from Psalm 127. [clears throat] "Unless the Lord builds the house, they labor in vain who builds it. Unless the Lord guards the city, the watchman stays awake in vain. It is vain for you to rise up early to sit up late to eat the bread of sorrows for so he gives his beloved sleep. Behold children are a heritage from the Lord. The fruit of the womb is a reward like arrows in the hand of a warrior. So are the children of one youth. Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them. They shall not be ashamed but shall speak with their enemies in the gate." Okay. So, who can explain what CJ just read? [CJ] Well. The summary of the verse is that we are wasting our time in any project that doesn't involve the Lord. Okay. Makes sense. God can give you good sleep. [CJ] It doesn't say that. Yes it did. Yes it says that. And mucho blessings are coming our way since CJ's gonna become a dad. [all laugh] [gentle music plays] [clears throat] Mom. This is CJ. I'm sorry. Marcella didn't say... It's okay. I know this must all be a shock. I'll say. CJ, this is my brother Hector. I know who you are. You're the guy who got my sis pregnant and now you're filling her head with garbage about raising a baby together. Like she's just gonna drop out of school, give up her scholarship and forget all about her dreams. - [Marcella] Hector. - Such a disappointment. You're supposed to be the good one. The smart one. You're supposed to get out of here and do something with your life, but now you make a big mistake all because of this guy. It's not his fault. It takes two. Nah. Nah I know guys like you. You think you a real player, huh? Well you just played the wrong family, fool. Hector. Mom, please. Hector, stop it. He's a guest in our home. He ain't no guest mine. I'm the man of this house and I say get stepping. Look, I don't want any problems. Too late for that. And if you don't start walking right now, it's gonna be a whole lot of trouble. You got that? I'm just trying to do the right thing. Then do the right thing and walk out that door. You know he's gonna run out on her anyway. So let's just get it over with. It's not gonna be like that. Okay, I would never do that to Marcella and our baby. Baby? Baby? Who said she's keeping it? I'm taking her to the clinic right now to clean up your mess. It's my body. I get to decide. I'm not gonna let you ruin your life for this guy. Marcella, maybe we should just go. Oh. Oh now she's going with you? I don't think so. Leave. Hector. Hector, stop it. [speaks in Spanish] Behave yourself. Look. Look at it. I was pregnant with Marcella in that photo. When your dad left, I thought about having an abortion. I already had you. I didn't wanna raise two kids on my own. But something held me back. I felt like I was carrying something special. A mother knows. [soft music plays] Please, accept my apology. I didn't mean to upset you. [speaks in Spanish] I didn't mean to cause any trouble between you and your family. I didn't mean any disrespect by coming here. I love Marcella but I do realize that this pregnancy was unexpected. [Hector] Ain't that the truth. But this wasn't planned. I just hope you can find it in your heart to forgive us no matter what Marcella decides to do. Please. Stand up. It's okay. These things happen. Life doesn't always go as planned and that can be a good thing. The Lord has a plan for us. A plan to prosper you and not to harm you. A plan to give you hope and a future. Jeremiah 29:11. You know the Bible, CJ? His dad's a pastor. Let's just eat. [soft music plays] [CJ] Look, just think about it, Marcella. I will. I'm serious. This is my baby too and I'll do anything it takes to take care of both of you. But seriously moving in with your folks? That sounds a little intense. No, that was intense. [chuckles] Plus it's not forever. It's just until we can get this figured out. They wanna help. Okay. I'll think about it. I don't want you feeling any pressure from Hector. Don't worry about him. I make up my own mind. Still. Not sure if this is the right environment. Didn't know you were back in town, Marcella. Miss seeing you around. Looking all flavors of fine. What's up? Okay, maybe it's not a bad idea. I'll tell my mom to prepare a room for you. You know this isn't exactly what I had in mind. Really? Thought you knew I was one of the good guys. We'll see. Okay. Come on, I'll give you a ride back. [soft music plays] [CJ] This is your car? [gentle music plays] ♪ In the still ♪ ♪ And quiet place ♪ ♪ I know ♪ ♪ You're there... ♪ Hello Pastor. Minister Marcus. So what's going on? I feel so ashamed after everything we did. You know these things do happen. Like you said in your sermon, "The righteous man may fall but they get up seven times." But your kids turned out okay. Well, it wasn't that easy for us. We had our challenges, too. I've been praying about letting you take over the daily operations of the church. I don't know. Why, what's going on? Becoming a grandpa and spending more time with my family, but I also think the Lord is teaching me balance. Hmm. You pray about it. I'll pray about it. I will see what God wants us to do. Thank you, Pastor. [soft music plays] [coach] Here we go. Get it done. Had a good game yesterday, fellas. Gotta get better. Snap those passes. Here we go. Why you late? I'm sorry, Coach. I just got back in town. Don't let it happen again. [upbeat music plays] Get this. Let's go to work. Keep working. [upbeat music plays] [Professor] All right, ladies and gentlemen. Class is. Mr. Okafor, is there somewhere more important you need to be? Hey, hey. Marcella. What was that? You're not staying in class? I'm dropping out, CJ. Dropping out? Wait, wait. Does that mean? I won't be able to hide it. I'll be getting big soon and people will start talking. I might as well get it over with and focus on my heath and the health of the baby. You decided we're doing this? I'm having the baby, CJ. Oh, my God. Oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay? It's fine. You didn't break me. Oh. Wow, we're doing this. Um, okay, well my mom said she can take you to your appointments if you want. I mean, I'm gonna try to come too if I'm not in school or practice or at work. Work? Oh, that's right. I didn't tell you. I got a job. I work at Brick Cafe. I'd like to see you in that uniform. Take it easy. Just trying to do what I can to provide. I gotta take you home. You gotta meet my parents, my sister, my brother. - Okay. - Okay. Let's go. Wait now? What about Professor Thompson? I can afford to miss one class. Come on. [soft music plays] Oh, it's you. Why didn't you just use your key? Monica, this is Marcella. Oh, hi Marcella. She doesn't look pregnant. Dad, you'll never guess who's here. Hello. I'm CJ's father. You are? Marcella. It's a pleasure to meet you. So this is the girlfriend? Girlfriend, huh? Hi there. What's all this? Mom, this is Marcella. The one I was talking to you about. It is a pleasure to meet you. You too. You'll have to join us for a meal. That sounds lovely. Thank you. Oh, and I was thinking that maybe we could sit down and talk about what we should do. Okay, let me go spend some time in the word, so I can stay in the spirit. Well come in. Oh, Marcella, would you like to bless the food for us? Chukwumah, don't make her uncomfortable on her first visit. It's fine. We used to pray as a family when I was little. Bless us oh Lord and this our gift which we are about to receive. In Jesus name amen. Amen. That was a beautiful prayer. Thank you, sir. So how did you and CJ meet? We're in the same class. Well. We were. Yeah. Marcella decided to drop out. And. I'm having the baby. That's excellent news. It's quite a relief. Yeah, but her brother doesn't exactly feel the same way. He wants her to terminate the pregnancy. Hector's stubborn but he'll come around eventually. [clears throat] Your brother, he lives with you? He's the man of the house or he likes to call himself that, but... there hasn't really been a man there since, um, my dad left. I see. Marcella, you know you're welcome to stay with our family and we won't mind taking care of the medical bills. Wow. Um, That's really kind of you. I don't know what to say. You can stay in the spare room until you have the baby. And afterwards we can get a nanny to take care of the baby here while you continue with school. Both of you. [CJ] Wow. Dad, I can't ask you to do that. Who's asking? I'm offering it to you. Thank you. I got a new job so I can help with the bills. A job? What about your studies? Mom, I need to step up. This is my responsibility. Can we eat now? Yeah, let's do it. [all laugh] What you gonna have? The chicken dinner. Okay. Chicken is good, man. Have you tried one? Burger and fries.
