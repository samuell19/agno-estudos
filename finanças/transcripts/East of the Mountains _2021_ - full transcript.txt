Hey. Come on. Beat it. Stay. Hmm. Am I late? Oh, no! Hi, Dad. Hi. Hi. How're you feeling? I'm fine, I'm fine. Chris was supposed to graduate this year, but because of the divorce, he's just gonna take a semester off. Take a semester off? Yeah, he wants to travel. He's saved up some money, and... You should come by the house. He really misses you. Well, Renee, I'm... uh... I'm going to take a few days I'm going to go hunting in my old stomping grounds, and I'm leaving in the morning. Oh! Who's going with you? Rex... and me. I've been thinking about it... for a while. Are you gonna go see Uncle Aidan? No. I just thought that maybe now things would be different than... What would be different? So when will you be back? Uh... Thursday or Friday. I'm okay, I'm just fine! I just wanna go over the mountains, and let the dog run around, and walk a little. Okay. When you come back, we're gonna have a serious talk. A serious talk. Yes. About you coming to live with us. You know. If you have to start treatment... If. I haven't heard back from the doctors at all. So it doesn't make sense to talk about anything. Doesn't make sense. No. Well, you know that's what you say when you just don't want to talk about something. right? Well, I just don't want to talk about it! Just like you don't want to talk about Mom... It's... it's late. Dad, I'm sorry, I'm not trying to box you in or anything. Chris is in college now and you just need someone to take care of. No! I'm just concerned about your health, Dad. I'm not sure my health is your business. I've barely seen you since mom died. I miss you. And I just want to spend some time together. I... I'm sorry. I have to go. Dad... Come on. Come on. Up you go. Up you go. Come on. Please leave a message after the tone. Hi, Dad, it's Renee. I hope I catch you before you leave. I'm sorry about last night. I didn't mean to offend you or upset you. I'm just not feeling that great about this trip that you want to take all alone. Will you please call me back when you get this message? Thank you, Dad. Love you. Bye. Oh! Oh, Jesus. Hey, how's it going? Well, not great. You got some car trouble? Yeah. Need a ride? Well, I could use one. I've got a dog, however, and, um... some other things. That's not a problem. Okay. - Thanks. - Need some help? No service. What are you gonna do with your car? I'll take care of it. Where you want us to take you? I was thinking of hunting up in Frenchman Coulee. Meeting friends up there. Sweet climbing spot. Perfect. Look, I don't want to take you out of your way. We're super flexible. It's not a problem. I appreciate it, really. I do appreciate it. What's his name? Oh, that's Rex. Are you from around here? Oh, I used to be. Do you still have family out here? Not really. Are you okay? Oh, yeah, it's just... bad back. I'm okay. Stay. You got everything? Yeah. I'm fine. I appreciate you doing this. Giving me a ride. Um. Here you go. Uh. Some snacks for later. We thought you could use it. Oh, that's really sweet of you. Thank you very much. You sure you're gonna be all right out here? I'm gonna be fine. Okay. I'm gonna be just fine. Thank you. You have a good climb? Thanks. Okay. - Bye, Ben! - So long. Come on. Come on, come on. Come on. Ah. Okay, here we go. Okay, let's go hunting. Hold up. Hunt 'em up. Hmm. Yeah. Okay. Whoo! Rex! Dammit. Rex! Rex! Get off! Get off, dammit! Oh, God. Hey. You alone down there? Can you help me? My dog's hurt. You fuckin' shoot my dog? Your dog had my dog by the throat. You coulda just kicked him off. Give him a good kick, my dog'll listen. I did that. He wasn't listenin'. Damn it. Your dog was gonna rip my dog's throat out. Maybe I ought to shoot your dog, too. You get down on the ground now. Turn your head away. You killed my dog. I'm takin' your gun. I need that gun. Shoulda thought of that before you shot my best coyote dog. Good boy. Hold still... Hold still. Okay. Okay. I know. Don't do that. Don't do that. Shh. Hey. Hey. Do you need help? My dog needs help. Let's get you into my truck. A vet I know. She's going to open her clinic. You're awake. You were sound asleep. He seems to be doing okay back there. Anita's here. Are you the owner? I am, yes. Thank you for coming out. Yeah, of course. I mean, when he asks me, how could I say no? I'm going to open up the clinic for us, okay? Okay. Thanks again. I owe you something. No, you don't. It's not necessary. Okay. Ooh... Are these your stitches? Yeah. You a doctor or something? I was. What happened? Dog fight? Yeah. Where? Bird hunting. Okay... I'm going to give him some fluids. I need to cut out your stitches, clean him up, sew him up. I'd say about $500? Okay. And he's going to need to be here a couple nights. How are your hands? They're okay. They're still good. I don't have anyone coming to help me. And I would like to get some rest before I have to come in tomorrow. You mind helping out? Okay. All right, I'm gonna give him... .32 mils of Dex... Good job. And now something for the pain. Good job, baby. You don't mind the music, do you? No. That's lucky because the other answer would have you waiting in the lobby, where you'd still be able to hear the music. You do these one-handed? I did. They're not bad. I was a cardiac surgeon for 50 years in Seattle. Oh. You got stories? Yeah. Just, you know, trying to pass the time. It will pass on its own. 3-0 Weblon with reverse cutting needle. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. That's very nice. I know. But thanks. Okay, so I have someone who comes in a little later tonight. She should be here shortly. What about you? You got a place to stay tonight? There's a motel up the street. It's on the way home. I can drop you off. Okay. Wow, this town sure has changed. Change is good. I could not get out of here fast enough. Why'd you come back? My brother died. And my nephew needed a stable home. Mm-hmm. Well, thank you for taking care of the dog. I really appreciate that. Yeah, no problem. All right, good night. And thanks for the ride. Get some rest. Yeah. All right. See you later. Yes, I brought the Brittany in last night. Are you Ben Gibbons? Anita told me about you. Okay. I heard you carried him all day yesterday after he was attacked. He sure wasn't going to carry me. Like carrying my buddy in the war. World War II? Korean War. How are you doing? Ben! What're you doing here? I thought you'd still be asleep! Hi! Uh... I had to see him. He's been through a lot, so he just needs some rest. - Yeah. - Hey. I have your number at the motel. I gotcha. Okay. Come on, Derek. I need your help with something. - Thank you. - All right, see you later. Appreciate it. Hey. You're usually faster than this. I can do this all day. You'll be doing it all day if you keep that up. Yeah... Hello? Hi, Ben. It's Anita. Oh, Anita. Yes, uh... How's Rex? I looked in on him before we left. His vitals look a lot better. Oh! Okay. Have you had dinner yet? No? Dinner? Yeah. I'm going to be passing by in about five minutes. If I slow down enough, you think you could jump in? Jump in? Yeah. Come have dinner at my house. I mean, we sewed up a dog together. I think we could at least make it through a dinner, no? Oh! Well, sure, I guess. Yes, that's fine. Thank you very much. I'll see you in five minutes. Okay, bye! Bye. Yeah, okay. Adios. Gracias. Hey, hey, hey. Did I mention I don't cook? Here you go. Well, thank you. Yeah, cooking is just way too claustrophobic for me. It's like the walls start to close in and... no. Derek though. Derek is a really good cook. - Cooks dinner most nights, huh? - Mm-hmm. How are the tacos? Not spicy, right? My mouth is full. Told you. The owner made it special for you. Oh, well, that was very nice. Lot more brown faces here than when you were a kid, huh? Ah... most the pickers came from Arkansas and Oklahoma in those days. Is that a marine plaque? Yeah... I joined, after my brother did. Derek's dad. Okay. - Where were ya? - Iraq. Then Afghanistan. Oh, boy. Y'all right? Yeah. Ben was in Korea. Huh. Were you a doctor out there? Oh, no, no, no... That's... where I thought I might be a doctor. Yeah. Did something happen? Yeah, my buddy got shot up pretty much. I had to haul him back to his aid station. I put him over my shoulder... and got there and there was no pulse... so the doctor did what he could. And I was there, watching it all, and... he had to slice the side of him so he could reach inside. And he's telling me all this. He puts the heart in his hand. Inside. Starts squeezing it. He said, "You kind of squeeze it... like a new sponge." Squeeze it... squeeze it... not too hard... squeeze it so there's a rhythm to it. And... suddenly, there's a pulse. Wow. And, uh... my buddy went home, got married, and had four kids. And I went to medical school, got married, and I have a beautiful daughter. I'm takin' your gun. What are you doing here, Ben? What do you mean? I mean, your car breaks down, and you just abandon it. Yeah? I feel like you would've gotten your car fixed and maybe even come back to Seattle. But you didn't. You kept going. This trip must have been really important to you. I have cancer. Have you told your family? My wife died a year ago. What about your daughter? She's going to find out eventually. I know. You don't know what's going to happen. But I do. I know exactly what's going to happen. Bedsores and bone fractures, bacterial infection, fluid in my lungs, vomiting, dehydration, cracked lips, dry mouth, pneumonia, the sensation of being strangled at the end, and a final drip of morphine. That's what's going to happen. That's how it would end. If I let it. You miss your home at all? You know what I miss? Fireflies! - You ever see them? - No. They're magical. Come on! Let's go! I wanna dance with you. Okay, okay, I'll dance. Good Morning, Sunshine. Good morning! I'm sorry... I... I fell asleep on ya. Yeah, damn near mid-sentence. It's all good, I didn't want to wake you up. Well, I made you some tea, I washed your shirts, and there is breakfast in the kitchen, whenever you're ready. - Oh. Thank you. - Yeah. No problem. Take your time. Okay. All right, see ya. Thank you for the ride. You betcha. See ya later. Okay. Huh. This paper has to come out whether there's any news or not. You ever think about that? "Honoring Barrows. Former Mayor Clint Barrows receives plaque for service." Breaking news. Two months ago. you sat in that same chair, pushed your beer aside, kindly said, "This paper has to come out whether there's any news or not." And then you read the headlines. S'cuse me, gentlemen. You don't happen to know anyone around here that handles coyotes. You got a problem with coyotes? Ah. You're looking for a man named Harden. What's his nephew's first name? Ethan. No, no. Ethan's his cousin. The nephew... Bill. Bill! Harden. Yeah. Lives up on his uncle's orchards. He runs his dogs down here sometimes. Hires 'em out to hunt coyotes. You know where I can locate this Bill Harden? It's up near... I can't remember the name of the orchard. It's got a funny name. Ah, they've all got funny names. Hey. Buddy. If you do find Bill... Word of advice. He's different. Keep the talk on the coyotes, you'll be fine. Thank you very much. Appreciate that. Thank you. Hey, Ben. Anita is in with a patient. I just want to say hello to Rex, see how he's doin'. That's cool. You know where he is. Yeah. Thank you. Hey. I'm gonna write down my daughter Renee's phone number. I want you to call her... have Anita call her... ask her to come and pick up the dog. Okay. Have a nice day. You are one ugly old man. Aidan. Nice place. If you say so. I was surprised to get your call. Ben Givens needs help. Wonders and miracles. How you doin', Aidan? I was sorry to hear about Rachel. What's it been... about a year now? What she ever saw in you. Wasted her good life. You think you made her happy? She didn't need me to be happy. How's Renee? I haven't seen her since high school. And I hear she has a... a son? Chris. In college. Ah, right. I think I've asked all the right questions. So why don't you just tell me... what do you need? Well, I'm lookin' for Bill Harden and I understand he lives in the area. I know him. What do you want with him? Just want to meet him. Rachel sent me a letter before she passed. Did she tell you? No. I think she knew pretty far out that this was her time. She wanted me and you to reconnect. I said I don't see a reason for that. There was nothin' between us. We just lived different lives. I got another letter from her. Short time later. It was a one-word response. Horseshit. She could be a real smartass. Yeah. I'm gonna go see about some lunch. After we eat, I'll take you to see the old ranch. Did you get any birds? Yeah, I got a couple. Where's your dog? You got a dog? Mm. Yep. Where is he? He got tore up. He's with a vet. Uh-huh. I still do some huntin' from time to time. When I'm in here, all I can think about is being out there. But lately, when I'm out there, I keep thinking how nice it'd be to be back in my chair. It's getting old, I think. You still have Dad's gun? Why do you think he gave it to you? I don't know. He must have wanted you to have it. I mean he had a reason. I don't know. I... I... I just thought it should have gone to me is all. You can't imagine what it was like with Dad at the end. I can imagine what it was like. No. You can't. He felt pushed out. Especially after the cabin burned down. The night he died, I was holding his head in my lap... trying to calm him down some. He would sleep shaking, and then jerk awake in the dark, afraid that he was going to slip away. Which he did a few hours later. I was with him when he sold off the land, when he was sick. I made his meals, I did his laundry. I did everything right. And when he was gone... what was left of me? I wasn't the kind of man that any woman wanted anymore. What did you expect of me? I had a practice. I had Renee. I... couldn't take care of him. You didn't even come back to help us put him in the ground. I was there for him. You should have been there for me. Aidan Givens. Leave a Message. Hello, Uncle Aidan. This is Renee. I'm Ben's daughter. I know we haven't seen each other in a really long time, but I'm looking for my dad. He went hunting over there... Are you going to get that? If you hear from him, if you see him... I've lost my appetite. Let's go. He had a car, it was found abandoned on the old highway, and I'm very, very worried about him. If you hear from him, if you see him... The new owners tore down our old place and built a new one there. Not so new anymore. I have cancer. I've got a year if I don't take treatment. Goddamn you. Sayin' something like that. Standing where we are. Would you even have called if you didn't need something from me? No. But I'm... I'm glad I did. Really. What do you want from Harden? It's a long story. It sure as hell ain't gonna be a short one. I mean, you out here with no wheels, no dog... dyin' from cancer... Harden's place is near here. Old Palisades Road. North Star Ranch. You want me to go with you? No. I'll go myself. This is it? This is it. Okay. Thanks. Ben, do you understand that I'm leaving? It shouldn't be a surprise. It's always been my plan. Somehow, I thought maybe you had a plan, too. I guess I did. But it wasn't this. Think about what you want from your life, Ben, and when you've done that, let me know. Bill Harden! What the hell are you doin' here? I came to get my gun. It ain't yours no more, old man. The gun has been with my family for a long time. It's not done yet. And I'm not done with it. You better get the hell out of here before I lose my temper. Do somethin' I'm gonna have to explain to the sheriff. Not without the gun. You're tresspassin'. Go ahead, do it. Shoot. Do it. Goddamnit, shoot. Go on, do it, damn it... Get your goddamned hands off! You crazy, stupid son of a bitch. I see you again, I'm going to hurt you before I kill you. Ben. Come on. Come on. Do it, Ben. I came to get my dog. Would you be so kind as to open your clinic? Of co... Get in here! God, you have no idea how happy I am to see you. So that number that you gave me... I hope you don't mind, but I went ahead and I called it. Renee. Dad. Oh, my God. - I was so worried about you. - Oh, my. Oh, my. Oh, I'm so glad to see you. I'm so glad you're here. Dad. They said that Rex got hurt? Did you get hurt? Rex is fine, I'm fine. I love you so much. I'm so happy that you're back. I'm so sorry. It's okay. It's okay. That's a good boy. Doin' okay? Yeah.
