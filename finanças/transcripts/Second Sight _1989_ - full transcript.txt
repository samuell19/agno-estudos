[Telephone rings] You've reached the second sight psychic detective agency. We know who you are and what you want, so at the sound of the beep, hang up. Preston, what the hell is taking so long? Is he getting anything? These things can't be rushed. I'm standing in a sewer in mortal fear that somebody in the neighborhood's going to flush. Bobby, you getting anything? No. Wills, how can I make you understand how counterproductive it is to disturb him? He's been slowing down. What is wrong with him? Nothing's wrong. He's just not a machine you turn on and off. He's a finely tuned human instrument. Great. Now I got a psychic oboe on my hands. ¶ Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart ¶ ¶ how the music can free her whenever it starts? ¶ ¶ and it's magic if the music is groovy ¶ ¶ it makes you feel happy like an old-time movie ¶ ¶ I'll tell you about the magic, and it will free your soul ¶ ¶ but it's like tryin' to tell a stranger 'bout rock 'n' roll ¶ ¶ do you believe in magic? ¶ ¶ don't bother to choose ¶ ¶ if it's jug band music or rhythm and blues ¶ ¶ just go and listen, and it'll start with a smile ¶ ¶ that won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try ¶ ¶ your feet start tappin', and you can't seem to find ¶ ¶ how you got there, so just blow your mind ¶ ¶ if you believe in magic, come along with me ¶ ¶ we'll dance until mornin' till there's just you and me ¶ ¶ and maybe if the music is right ¶ ¶ I'll meet you tomorrow sort of late at night ¶ ¶ and we'll go dancin', baby, then you'll see ¶ ¶ how the magic's in the music and the music's in me ¶ ¶ do you believe in magic? ¶ [siren] ¶ Magic ¶ ¶ do you believe like I believe? ¶ ¶ magic ¶ ¶ do you believe like I believe? ¶ ¶ do you believe? ¶ ¶ do you believe in magic? ¶¶ so what do you got? Place had some kind of expensive art. Now it don't. That's it? Those weirdos are here. Eh, noogie! Lieutenant manoogian. Good to see you again. How are you? You guys are starting to get hot. Third big case in six months. What is going on? Mr. And mrs. Bloom, wills, second sight detective agency. Your insurance company sent them. How do you do? That's dr. Preston pickett ph.D. And the renowned psychic bobby mcgee. Is he prepped? Shh. Bobby, what's in my pocket? Envelope. What's in the envelope? Picture of a sailboat. What's on the sail? A drawing. A crest. What's on the crest? Six little... what's sophia loren's phone number? 011... wills! Bobby. We're ready. Is this a joke? The stolen piece was priceless. Bobby will contact murray. Murray will tell us who stole your piece, where it is. Everybody will be happy. Who is murray? Bobby's spirit guide. He's dead. [Chanting gibberish] Is that murray? Too early to tell. What do you want, huh? Something missing, or what? That's murray. Somebody going to answer me, or I'm talking to myself? I demand that this insanity be stopped! Quiet, please. Please. Murray, it's preston pickett ph.D. Can you locate the thief? I repeat. Can you... I heard you the first time. I'm dead, not deaf. Is this guy talking to me, or what? The thief is in this room. The thief is... No, no, no. He's fine. Please. Hi, pres. She's not pregnant. Go get him, kid. Fritz! You, the thief? Nonsense. Why would I dig a tunnel? I can just take. Fritz, babe, he's never wrong. A gift from the second sight detective agency. If they let you out, I'll make you miserable! So what else is new? Let's find the sculpture for the nice lady, collect our money, and go home. Bobby. Preston? Hmm? Oh. Bobby. Hi. Wills. Find the sculpture. What the hell? What the hell's happening? I don't know! Oh, bobby! Murray! Spirit! Guide! Asshole! Shit! Murray! Murray! Found it. [Pop music playing] [Jazz music] [Orchestra music] I'll take care of this. Will you get this guy under control? I'm sorry. Bobby. Bobby. Could you turn that off, please? You can play later. Hi, davey. Give me the regular. You got it. Good morning, boys. Well, I've got some good news and some bad news. The bad news... our cut from the recovery of the sculpture was $100,000, but deducting the deductible for mrs. Bloom's bust leaves us a grand total of $11.35. What could the good news possibly be? They paid us in cash. Thanks, dave. Can I freshen up your trough, bob? Last night's adventure took it out of bobby. Obviously he's put it back in. Bobby, are you finished? Yeah. I've got some new tests. I like tests. Speaking of tests, see the redhead? Virgo or libra? Scorpio. This is for science. Married, single, divorced? Single. She got away from a man that was... It was a bad relationship. And she wanted... She wanted babies. I don't want that. What a jerk! He's not a dating service. This is improper use of bobby's gift. Bobby, let's go. Don't you want to see if he's right? Absolutely not. Why did you even answer him? Good morning. I'll bet your breakfast you're a scorpio. Yeah? May I? I got this feeling in back of me, and I want you to know you were absolutely right telling that creep to get lost. God! How did you know that? When the soul is pure, the eyes are windows. Wills. Karen. I know. Just a little more! Bobby, stop! Please come back! No more testing! Fine. No more testing. No, please. Do that one. All right. Come on. Just a few more. Here we go. Ah. Ah. Ok. Good. Bobby, stop. Ow! All right, stop. That's it. The test is over for real. Hi, wills. Did you score? What did you say? I don't know. Hello, sweet thing. Any messages? No? Bob, I want to... talk to preston in there. Also, I want you to... stay out here because you want to be alone. And don't... tune in on your thoughts because you hate that. Yes. I want the next job to be something that won't tax bobby unduly. There's a dented car case. That's his speed right now. With what we make on it, maybe we can buy him his afternoon snack. No. Oh, you look very nice. Thank you. What are you doing? I got to block what's going on in there by putting on these dark, ugly colors. Why, thank you. It doesn't always have to be about money. Don't talk to me about money, with your $6.00 suits and degree from sears. I tried to block what was going on, but that last remark really hurt my friend. I'm sorry. Thank you, bobby. Wills has been under a lot of pressure. A minute on the lips, a lifetime in the heart. [Choking] Good evening. I'm jack hynes. And I'm odetta rogers. After this beloved pope is laid to rest, the cardinals will convene to elect... The united states may have its first pope ever. The public funeral became even more so with the taking of communion, as the cardinals and dignitaries moved to the steps of the basilica. Preston, how did you afford all that new stuff in the kitchen, hmm? Oh, lucky us. Priscilla won it in a contest. I think I'll make bobby something to eat, in case he gets hungry in the night. Herman? Wills. Now, give me 100 on the as and 50 on the dodgers. Yes. Dodgers. That's a pretty good average. You're batting 1.000. I didn't know you were a baseball fan. How are you getting tips out of bobby? I won't tell preston. He gets upset when he thinks people are misusing the gift. That's why I don't misuse it. It's luck, wills, just dumb luck. Shithead. Dodgers or mets? Solidad. Who is solidad? Dodgers? He's a dodger? Mets? He's a met? Dodgers or mets? Yes! Yes! Who? Dodgers... By big spread. Oh. Oh, baby! Don't touch me, bobby. Oh! Oh! Oh, hold me! Bobby, bad boy! Bobby, stop it! Bad boy. Very bad boy! Oh, baby! You're the best! We got to get you a woman. Wills, just hear them out. Admittedly, it's a small case, but it's the kind of thing bobby can handle now... I think. All right, I'll listen, then I'll say no. Come in, please. Maria solidad, sister elizabeth, this is wills. Hello. Hello. Enough small talk. What do you want? Maria, I think we better go. No, no, no. Please stay. He has a roughhewn sense of humor. Sit down, please. Please. Thank you. How can we help you? I am cardinal o'hara's executive secretary. Did I come on time? Ladies, this is bobby mcgee. Hello. Hello. Please go on. I work at saint martin's church. You're the friend with the pencil... Assistant. Of the man in the red gown. The cardinal. And you are in the wrong clothes. Um... Three days... Uh... Before, you are driving down the, uh, street, and there's a loud, sharp sound behind you, and then a big... Car comes and smashes into your rear end, and the money to fix your car is 3... Million dollars. 3 thousand dollars, and we have no insurance. And you have the most beautiful pink... 3, um... $3,000? What did I say? Why can't I get that right? How exactly did he do that? It wouldn't interest you. You'd be surprised what interests me. It's voodoo. Roughhewn. No. Actually, bobby is a power psychic. He reads minds. No. Kreskin reads minds. Bobby combines the talents of a deep-trance channeler, an empath, and a psychometrist. That clears that up. I'm sure there's lots of knuckles you could be smashing back at the convent. Do I smell a lapsed catholic? Yes. I graduated from our lady of the iron underwear. Really? I stopped wearing iron years ago. Well, has this been fascinating? But I'm sure you have other detective agencies to check out. I would like to try this one. We should think about this. I want him. Maria. Please? Well, it's maria's car, and she seems convinced, so I guess you're it. Your standard fee of 10% is just fine with us. We'll meet you at saint martin's this afternoon. Is 3:00 ok? Good. See you then. Nice meeting you, too, sister elizabeth. She needs a man, maybe a tall man. Wills, for god's sake, she's a nun. 10% of $3,000... that's swell. From now on, I decide what cases we take and when we take them. Ah! Let me tell you something. You know who's talking now, right? Murray's back. I want you to hear me. Please hear me. I don't like to be violent. I want to be nice. You better keep away from that nun. None of that nun! Back off! Oh, bobby? Yeah? Wills! Don't touch me! Just get me to a hospital. I'm hurt. What the hell is he hobbling for? He's having an empathic episode. What does that mean? He shit his pants? "Shit his pants." Bobby, don't. Stop it. Your back hurts, so his back hurts. He's got the wrong side. He's always had tremendous difficulty... with left and right. I know. What the hell was murray doing? What was all that babbling? "None of that nun, wills!" Bobby, you pick up anything weird from her? Did you read anything unusual... did you get a job translating english into english? May I talk to him directly? Be my guest. Thank you. Bobby, did you pick up anything weird from her? What does he mean "weird"? Did you read anything negative in her aura? Yeah, she's got some... Brown... Spots on top of her heart. Um... She was hurt badly by some... Raisins, and... Murray does not like her. What the hell is he doing? He's reading your fifth to seventh chacre. Very rare. Wills is going to be opening up his heart to a woman. Ha! Fat chance! My pants, maybe. Never my heart. Let's get out of here. We don't want to keep attila the nun waiting. You should've got the car fixed. They're going to dump it. Let's do another dry run by the church. This is nuts. He wants us to hold him 10 days, then let him go? We can get big bucks for this guy. Black queen. I'm talking about the card. Just because you had one bad experience with a woman... being a cop who gets dangerous assignments just so the chief can boff his wife is "one bad experience"? Move it! Boffed his wife. Boffed his wife. Bobby, shh. The chief only tried to get you killed a couple of times. Mostly he sent you out so he could lie down on your wife naked. In that case, I won't be bitter one more minute. That is wonderful! Her love can flow in. Your love can flow out. In and out. In and out. Until I see you on one date, I don't want lectures on in and out from you. Wills, that's not fair. Bobby just hasn't integrated the romantic, social, or sexual side of his nature into his personality. Hey! Wills, your, um... Blood pressure. Is way up. Oh, do tell. And your... Sperm count? Is way down. Way down. Bobby, stop that. What? Preston, make him stop that. Bobby? Yeah? Stop that. Ok. Good afternoon. Hello. Hi there. Thank you so much for helping me. You're late. Cardinal o'hara, this is mr. Wills, dr. Pickett... Oh. And bobby mcgee. Sister elizabeth has told me all about you. I see you with a doctor. I have an appointment for a checkup. Don't be worried. It's only... Hemorrhoids. Bobby! Mr. Wills! What did I say? I appreciate the good news. Good day, gentlemen. Preston, stop him! Don't touch him! Stay back, everybody. The cardinal is safe. Bobby is covering him in a shield of hyperpolarized ions. Very rare. Obviously he's protecting you, your eminence, because you must be in danger. What kind of danger? I don't know. Bobby, what kind of danger? Apparently, it's some sort of generic danger. Preston, give him some candy. Hmm? Candy! Ow. Bobby, chew. Ow. Well, this is slightly embarrassing. Chew. Bobby. Pretty windows. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Although this world can be a dangerous place, I'm sure the good lord will see fit to protect me. Good day, my friends. That young man should be on a leash. Hmm. Ok. Baseball. Oh, look. I don't know what happened to you. Oh. They blacked out the game. Are you trying to break my neck? By his 12 throne bearers, the men who served him during his reign. Incense smoke rose slowly... but I had a bath. When? July 4, 1910. Balki! Balki! Balki! Balki! Low ball's a strike. That's it. Move over a little. Perfect. With the taking of communion, as the cardinals and the dignitaries moved to the steps of the basilica. You play for a run now. The non-italian could understand. [Changing channels rapidly] [Groaning] Wills, stop that right now. Let him go! Let him go! He needs his rest. It's preston. It's ok. Bobby. Bobby. It's ok. Bobby. Bobby, listen. Listen to me, bobby. I want you to go upstairs, really clean your electromagnetic field, ok? And get some sleep. Go. Definitely under for 100. Right. Give me 50 straight across on the mariners and the yanks. Ok. You were saying? Oh, I said, my initial results are very disturbing. I've done a graph... sorry. I've done a graph of bobby's recent interface times. It isn't good. So what the hell does this mean? It seems that bobby can't contact murray. What the hell does that mean? I can't predict bobby's performance level. Murray is appearing unannounced. He seems to be in a foul mood. What's really scaring me is, if we keep pushing bobby, there's no telling what might happen. He could blow a fuse? Go up in flames? Trance himself into the ozone? Yes. I can live with that. Let's get value for our dollar. Let him give me one tip and make me wealthy. Absolutely not! Using the gift to make a dishonest quick buck? No, sir! Um... Hmm... Uh... 16. 24. 8. Priscilla? What are you doing here? Tomorrow's numbers. 15. 20. What's happening here? I came in to get the lottery numbers. That's how we've been winning all those things. I get tips when he's sleeping. Don't look at me like that. It's a disease. I need help. Oh, god, preston. I'm a psychoholic. Why didn't you come to me? I would have helped you. I feel so ashamed. All right. All right. We'll work this out... Somehow. [Singing gibberish] Don't touch him. Don't touch him, bobby! Wills! Wills! I told you, touch me when I'm sleeping, I pull a gun. Am I in bed? Murray is talking to bobby. Murray says that the men who hurt maria's car are moving, and that if we go right now, then we'll, we'll... Run into them. We'll run into them! Let's get this two-bit case over with! Move it! I'm trying here, all right? Bobby? Yeah. I need a direction. Straight ahead, babe. There's a building there. Good point. You're right. Left or right? Right! Was that your left-right or your right-right? Oh, shoot! You've got me. I, um... Let me see. Preston, why the hell can't he get this straight? A psychic uses both hemispheres of his brain simultaneously. I've got a building in front of me... just point, for pete's sake! Thank you! Mary and joseph. This is the place. You're sure this is it? This is it. So, what do we do? Well... Can't just sit around. I'm going to check it out. No... I'll be all right. Preston, watch him. Get out of the way, asshole! Get out of the way! Shit! Oh... Well, you certainly are accident-prone. Thank you. What? I told you we'd run into them. No, bobby. They ran into me. Well, this has been a perfect ending... To a perfect evening. I'm going to go get some pot stickers. Does anyone think... I was going to... excuse me. Oh, sorry. Oh, shut up. [Speaking chinese] [Speaking chinese] Ah, yo. What did you just do? I'm ordering. You want the orange-flavored beef. Don't do that. I'd like to see a menu, please. I'll have the orange-flavored beef, please. [Speaking chinese] Hee hee! What's up, bob? Don't go anywhere. Don't stand up. Just eating my beef, babe. Just stay. So, tell me about this spirit guide. Murray? His name is murray? Yeah. He helps me so he can be free. His name is murray? Well, why isn't he free? What's his problem? Women. Could you be more specific? One killed him. Very tragic, and he continues to blame her. He can't go to higher levels while hanging on to resentments from the earthly plane. Well... This woman, she murdered him, right? No. Sent him for ice cream. He was creamed by a truck. I have to go. [All] Up the stairs, first left. No. I have to go home. Early mass. Ok. I'll take you. No. Thank you. I'll give you a ride. All right. Thank you. [Murray] Where do you think you're going? You leaving without saying good-bye? No hello for an old friend? Murray... Is that you? No, it's aunt bee. Who the hell you think? Wait a minute. You were his girlfriend? But you're a nun. Oh, I wasn't born a nun, bozo! Murray, I can explain. Explain how much you need rum raisin ice cream. And you, you stupid long drink of water... You don't listen too good. I said don't make me do something I don't want to do. I told you I don't want to be violent. I want to be nice! Oh! Now's a good time for goobers. Goobers! Oh! I'm out. I'll get some. My man bobby over here, he tried to tell you. He says, "wills, don't go nowhere." You don't listen. You're too busy packing your beef. Calm down. Wait. Excuse me! Excuse me. I'm sorry. Do you have any goobers? [Speaking chinese] No, no! Goobers. Chocolate-covered peanuts. Very small. It's the only thing that can calm down a psychic when his dendrites are firing. Ahh! Goobers! Goobers! To deal with me, put her down. I can't. I'm holding on to resentments from the earthly plane. Ah ha ha ha! Wow! Ok, darling. You want ice cream, you got it. Ah ha ha... rum raisin? [Slurps] Pistachio. Bobby, take your hands off of those, please. Preston. Preston. Preston! Excuse me. Is this usual? Yes. He's reading your psychic hot spots. I had no idea nuns could feel like that... And about wills. That can't be possible. And he's thinking about you right now. But how can that be? I'm a nun. It's so obvious. I'm ashamed I didn't see it. What? Murray is dysfunctionary... cut to the chase, preston. He's jealous. He is simply jealous. If you could resolve your problems with murray, I'm sure it will help us. How do I do that? Through bobby. You want to talk to murray to tell him you know how he feels. You want to lay everything on the table and get it away forever. Exactly! You can't. Why not? Bobby! Now, bobby... [Murray] Oh, baby. He's in there, isn't he? Yeah. Don't touch me. Murray, this is kate. What are you trying to pull? You've already made me feel guilty, so guilty that I ended up in a convent. He says, "beats being dead." Ok. Yes. I asked him to go get ice cream, but I didn't make you go. What do you mean, you didn't make me? Oh! Murray! Murray! You were nagging me for two hours. I tried to touch you. You pushed me away. I didn't push you! Murray, it's over! Davey, davey! This is so interesting. We have a life-and-death situation whose outcome hinges on resolving a romantic triangle between a nun, a detective, and a dead guy. Right. Well, I think it's interesting. Why can't you forgive me? First you got me killed. Now you're dumping me. I'm not dumping you. Murray, you're dead, honey. Maria, it's vital that you drive the exact route so that bobby can reconstruct the accident. We turned out of the church parking lot, and we're driving down wilson street. Suddenly, we heard screeching behind us. Uh-uh-uh-uh! He's getting something. Is there some special way to ask him what he's feeling? Yes. What are you feeling? Would you... [tires screeching] What is this? He's channeling. This is why you're an asshole. [Horns honking] Oh! Come on! I got work to do today! Bobby... Is he dead? Yo, man! Stay out of my face! Hi, baby. Heh, heh, heh. Shit. [Horns honking] Yo, bro. Don't honk at me! I'll break your brains all over the place. He's out of body! He's one of the men who hit your car. What you looking at? Oh, jesus! No offense. Yo, mama. You look fine. Oh, bob? Don't crowd me, now. Get back in the car. Take that shit and stick it. Not the front seat. Let a real man drive. Don't let him drive! Ha ha! We're moving now. What are you doing? Ha ha ha! Yeah, baby! Stop it! Preston, any assistance would be appreciated! The dendrites are firing and synapsing. It's flooding his brain with information. The only thing that will help is his goobers. Why not give him a couple? It'll take more than a couple. Preston! Huh? Oh! Whoo! I lost my goobers. There are no more. I'm so sorry. Were those the goobers you dropped? [Radio] ¶ we're goin' ridin' on the freeway of love ¶ ¶ wind's against our back ¶ ¶ we're goin' ridin' on the freeway of love ¶ ¶ wind's against our back ¶ ¶ hey, we're ridin' on the freeway of love ¶ ¶ in my pink cadillac... ¶ bobby, I take it back! This is why you're an asshole! ¶ We can't quit till we get to the other side ¶ ¶ uh-huh, uh-huh... ¶¶ uh! Hey! Yeah! [Speaking spanish] Bobby! You were saying? [Speaking spanish] Out! Out! Preston, I can't let go! I can't... grab the wheel! I can't move my foot! Oh, shit! Aah! Whoa! Ugh... Wills! Oh! Shit! It's a nun! Mr. Wills! Mr. Wills, can you hear me? You broke my house! Who the hell are you? [Coughs] We're from the second sight... ah! From the second sight detective agency. We're impressed. Who gives a shit? That's them! That's the man! You ruined my car! Yo, mama. Woo! You let her go! Don't crowd me, now. Oooah! Oooah! Bobby! Stop. That's enough. That's enough. Let's get out of here! Come on! Let's go! Don't worry! I'm in charge! Where am I? [Creaking] You were so brave to save me from those men. Oh, my god. I'm not moving another step. This bridge is officially my home. Wills? What? Let me just do one thing. Please don't touch me. He's trying to help. Ok. If he hurts me, I won't be happy. That's it, wills. We can go now. Thank you. I feel much better. Does that make you happy? Yes. This happy. This was one of the more memorable days of my life. I told you we were weird. What are the police doing about this? Who could have done this? Teenagers, gang members... Atheists? I can assure you we will leave no stone unturned. Some people say the fish hut's an eyesore anyway. No further questions. Special agent alman, fbi. I'd forget about your joy riders and catch up with the big boys. I'm coordinating the o'hara case. If you got something to say, just say it. We just got the word at headquarters... cardinal o'hara and maria solidad were just kidnapped from saint martin's. Holy shit! Very. Now stay out of it. Kidnapping is a federal offense. We're not staying out of anything. We're going to solve this o'hara case. I don't care what you do. Just do it. Who ate my eggs? [Belches] All right. Look. Flipper here performed the demolition derby on every car in boston. I didn't mean to. Of course you didn't. If anybody asks, you didn't do anything. I didn't do anything. Right. Hello, boys. Hi. Mind if I join you? Sure. I got some bad news. I didn't do anything! Bobby! Do what? Nothing. We're fine. I'm talking about the o'hara case. What o'hara case? Where have you been? Cardinal o'hara was kidnapped a couple hours ago along with maria solidad. ¶ Aah ¶¶ we saw them yesterday. Bobby saw the danger. You just had the wrong day. The chief thinks the feds will solve this case before we do. I thought you might be interested. Coolidge ok'd me on this? He said do whatever it takes. Well? He likes it. Don't do that. I like it. I'm not sure bobby's ready... consider the case solved. This is big. "Second sight detective agency "rescues future pope. Vatican bestows medals." They might even canonize us. So, no screw-ups. I can't guarantee a glitch-free operation. Murray's not cooperating. That's hurting bobby's ability to harness his power. Get his reins on. This is one major gig. Aah! Ow! Oh! Oh! Bobby, get the lighter! Ah! Ow! God damn it! That thing is super hot. I'm not taking him on an important gig looking like that. Wills, please. I'm warning you. This constrictive style, these dark colors... You'll seriously inhibit the flow of psychic energy. This is the big time. He's got to look like it. Doesn't he look good? No. He looks fantastic. Burn those. Folks, back up, please. We need you behind the barricade. Take it easy. Hey, hey, hey. All right, all right. Relax. Let's go, bobby. Preston? He can't function in these horrible, albeit terribly expensive, clothes. Never mind. I'll do it myself. Come on, bobby. Come on. That's a boy. Good boy. You look great. Mr. Wills! No comment right now. Mr. Mcgee seems to be ill. He just had a bad omelet for lunch. We don't have any comment now. Please, just stick around. Did you know the cardinal's been kidnapped? Special agent alman, fbi. I don't believe in this psychic bullshit. I won't tolerate it. You have any legitimate findings, report directly to me. If you screw up, you're dead meat. [Cameras clicking] I'm sorry, sir. We have business here. It's all right, officer. Oh, my goodness. What are you all doing here? Actually, I wanted to spend more time with you. I don't have any more cars you could crash, if that's what you're looking for. Actually, they've decided to send the big shots in to handle the o'hara case. Well, I'm glad... I think. Could we talk to the bishop? Oh, yes. Of course. Come with me. That was a nice thing you did, giving maria that check for the car. Maybe the next one won't bounce, huh? I assure you, the boston police will do all they can. The church will do everything it can to help, but they must be found. That's where we come in. Bishop o'linn, this is detective wills. Mr. Wills. Dr. Preston pickett and mr. Bobby mcgee. Mr. Mcgee. [Buzz] He's been under pressure lately. If you have any further questions about our beloved cardinal and our dear maria, father dominic will be able to help you. Thank you. Stay here. I want you to hear this. He's fine. Father dominic... So, what happened? Cardinal o'hara had just finished the sunday mass when the kidnapping occurred. We heard maria scream, but by the time we got here, it was already too late. Ah! Ho ho ho! Bobby! Bobby! I got them off. Bobby, this isn't good. Please put something on. No! Please, bobby! I'm alive! Ha ha! He can't be in the church in his underwear. I wouldn't argue that. Stop! Oh, no. Please. Find him some light-colored clothes! I think I'll find something. But only natural fibers. Bobby! Right. Yes. I'm alive! Bobby... Uh! Shh! Bobby... Focus. Ohh... May I have the cardinal's shoe, please? Ahh... What are you feeling, bobby? Red hat. Good. Focus. Ahh... Where do you see the red hat, bobby? It's in the... [knocking] Uh! Gentlemen, I'm sorry we're late. I am personally taking over this case. What's he doing here? You said do whatever it takes. You promised you'd keep him away from me. I'm throwing you off this case! I fired you three years ago! I walked off! You promised you'd keep this little shit... gentlemen! Thank you. These detectives were hired by the church. We'd all appreciate it if you could put your personal differences aside until we find maria and the cardinal. All right. Bobby... You can try the shoe again. Ohh... Ahh... Bobby, where did you see the red hat? Hey, man, look. Yo, mama. Man, you know I wouldn't hurt my sweet thing. Wait a minute. Y'all don't crowd me, now. That's the man from... My god! The men who hit maria's car kidnapped the cardinal. They were casing the church when the accident happened. What accident? I've had all the stupidity I can take! Find them, or it's your job. That's all we have to say for the moment. The second sight detective agency is on the job, and this case is all but solved. Sister elizabeth... Would you like to make a statement? No. Father dominic will answer all of your questions. Excuse me. Hi. What are you doing? I'm sitting in the back of your car. How are we going to find them? We're detectives. We'll detect. Wills, we have to go look at the letter. Give me money, or I'll kill you! The ransom note. Manoogian didn't say anything about that. Well, it hasn't arrived yet. It just arrived. I'm going to kill him. Go, wills. I'm going. Stop! What? Seat belts. We don't have seat belts. Very good point. You sure coolidge won't come back soon? Yeah. He'll be gone for hours. Come on in. Close the door. What did the note say? They want $1 million a week from wednesday. Who keeps a cardinal for 11/2 weeks? Why is this here? Don't pay any attention to that. The chief caught it himself. He loves that more than anything in the world. Ugh! She's dead. We picked that up for ourselves. If you need the little boys room, go find it. I don't need it. Then why are you doing the pee-pee dance? I'm not. You are. It looks like you're doing the pee-pee dance, bobby. Bobby is having an empathic episode. It's chief coolidge who's doing the pee-pee dance. The chief sure drinks a lot. Could you get him under control, preston? Oh, yes. Bobby... Bobby... Ahh... [Gurgling] Thank you. Bob? Oh, you want the note. It's in the middle, uh... Drawer. Yes. There's blood on it. Whose is it? Oh, oh! It's maria's! Yeah? Can you see where they are? I don't see anything! He can't function when he's emotionally involved. Preston, we need this information. Look, you keep pushing, something might happen to bobby. That I won't permit. [Murray] Kate, how you doing? Sister... Sister elizabeth? Yes. Could you help with bob? Yes. Of course. Ahh... Hmm. You know something, noogie? No. What? Let me see if I can get anything from this note. Bobby didn't have the gift until he was struck by lightning. I hurt my back recently. [Chanting gibberish] "Talk to the fish." The fish? The fish. We'll talk to the fish. Fish. Go ahead. Talk to the fish. Wills, talk to the fish, but be careful of it, ok? Fish... Wills? Fish, lead us. Come on, wills. Put that down. Fish! Fish! Lead us, fish! Tell us, fish. What the... [splash] The fish didn't know shit. This is fun. I haven't talked kidnapping with anyone in years. Remember the time I kidnapped that woman? Feisty little devil. That was weird. Are you still married to her? Oh, yeah. It's fun reminiscing, but I've got a time-pressure thing. What do you make of this cardinal business? Something doesn't smell just right. What do you mean? There are only three legitimate reasons for a kidnapping... money, sex, politics. A million bucks is a lot of money. Small change. I kidnap a cardinal, I ask a least three million. A guy who could be pope, five! These guys aren't too smart. Punks can't pull off an operation like this. Somebody else set this up. Makes a lot of sense. We can rule out sex. That leaves us politics. Politics. What kind of politics? Noogie. Wills. Did you get anything on that car yet? Good. What is it? 824 ula. Great. I've been snooping. The cardinal doesn't think bishop o'linn is fit to be the pastor of a kennel. He's been trying to bump him out of the archdiocese. Bishop o'linn doesn't want the cardinal to become pope. Right. Ok, I'll be in touch. Mr. Wills. Hi. There's good news? Nothing yet, father... Um... Dominic. I was told I could find bishop o'linn here. He's playing golf. That's quite a swing you have there, bishop. Mr. Wills. I wasn't expecting you. Have you any news? You haven't found him, have you? Not yet, but we're getting very close. Don't let me disturb you. Please, go ahead. Something occurred to me, and I wanted to run it by you. Do you know of anybody who might not want the cardinal to become pope? I don't know what you mean. Do you know of any enemies he might have? I know you two go way back. You were both up for cardinal at the same time. I'd like to think that people of the church can transcend that kind of individual pettiness and jealousy. Oh, yes, absolutely. Mind if I give it a little hack? No. Please. Thank you. I couldn't help but noticing coming in, this is quite a place you've got here. It isn't mine. It belongs to cardinal o'hara. Well, it must be nice, though, to have the use of it while he's away. Yes. Something else I was curious about. If, god forbid, the cardinal should not make it back, who would be his successor? I know there's a tradition in this archdiocese to promote from within. Well, I guess it would be me, but the final decision is left up to the pontiff. Yes, of course. I won't disturb you any further. Thank you for your time. A little tip... keep your head up and, uh... Down. Here's the plan. I will drop you both off at davey's diner. Wills, we should be together. Preston, tell noogie bishop o'linn is guilty, but not to pick him up until the cardinal and maria are safe. I need to be with you. When I find the caddy that nearly hit me, I bet I find the cardinal and maria. I should be driving. [Chanting gibberish] What the hell? ¶ Aah! ¶ preston. Just a minute. ¶ Aah! ¶ tell me it's postnasal drip. No. He's using psychic sonar. It's very rare. He's obviously looking for something. They're in there. Bobby, it's sunday. Nobody's in there. Bobby, who's in there? The bad guys. There's danger to the cardinal. I have to get in there. I have to save them! Coming. I'm coming. Preston, have I told you yet today how much I hate it when he does this? I'll go get him. Nobody's in there. He can't hurt himself. What was that? Probably just the sonar popping a few windows. Psychics don't have that kind of energy, do they? Get your lard ass over the seat! Would you get back here? Get down! I know I'm not going to like the way this turns out. [Knock on window] They weren't in there. Oh, shit! I hope he's all right. Are we just going to sit here? He said he'd call. He hasn't called. How long do we have to wait? [Knock on door] [Muffled] I'm going to get you back for this. What did he say? He says it's getting too hot. We move them tonight. [Chanting gibberish] Bobby! Yes? They're taking someone... Moving? Murray says they're moving them again. Where the hell are we taking them? Take them to my mom's house in pittsburgh. We're going to pittsburgh? Shut up, elmore. Shouldn't we have waited for wills? Murray said that we should go without wills. He says that we don't need wills. Why would he say that? Bobby, are you sure they're going to pittsburgh? Why don't we just dump them and get out of here? You make me want to puke. Wills. Wills, be careful! Wills, get out of that alley! Is there a problem? Is he going to be ok? Yes, he's fine. He hasn't been feeling well. We're taking him to the betty ford clinic. Bobby, I'm going to take my hand off your mouth. Tell us quietly what is wrong. Wills is in trouble. I've got to save him. I know what I got to do. I repeat. We're leaving airport taxi lanes. What the hell is going on down there? Stop that god damn plane! Will you shut everything down? I can't get this to stop. Ladies and gentlemen, please don't be alarmed, and don't touch him! We are witnessing spontaneous psychic teletransportation. Not at all dangerous, but very rare. Ladies and gentlemen, as you may have noticed, we've left the airport. There's absolutely nothing to worry about. We advise that you remain seated, put your head between your legs, and kiss your ass good-bye. I'm going in. Hmm? Oh. We're not going to make it! Is everybody all right? Yes. Everybody's fine. As soon as we save our friend wills, you can have your plane back. Thank you. We're coming, wills. We're coming. Bend over, wills. Bend over! Watch it, wills! Oh, shit! Back them up! Don't speed. We don't want to attract attention. Aaah! Hey! Wait for me! Jesus christ! Nobody said anything about using the guns. Meet me in the alley. We're going to kick their butts. Wahoo! All right, you assholes! Oh, shit. Wills. Bobby, get down! [Gunshot] Wills, you ok? Get down! Bobby, come on. Preston, the door. Watch him. Come on, get in here. Preston, let's go! Come on! Keep moving. There's an exit on the other end. ¶ Aah aah ¶ what the hell is happening to him? He's having a psycho sexual overload. Very understandable. Do something! Give me your jacket, please. Yes. Go. Hey, what's your hurry, wilbur? Yeah, what's the hurry, wilbur? Other way! Other way! Going somewheres? Drop it, or somebody dies. Bobby, please, we need your help. ¶ Aah aah ¶ sister elizabeth, we're screwed. Watch your language. Hyeee! Move! Wednesday! Bingo! Watch your head. Go around the side to the alley to the stairs. They've got to be here. You call manoogian. I'm going with you. Oh. This will be a big one at confession. It's all right, bobby. It's me, preston. ¶ Aah aah ¶ bobby, focus! What's the matter? Where are you? They must have went upstairs. Oh, god! I should have played sports. Come on, bobby. One more. What the hell's taking so long? All right, men, surround that god damn airplane until I get to the bottom of this. They're up there. Stay where you are. That building's off limits. Oh, yeah? Watch this. What are you you doing? Going with her! I'll have your ass, manoogian. Those psychic dicks come near me, I swear I'll shoot. Drop it, asshole! Yeah, come on! Come on! Give me that. Schmuck! Please, wake up. Catch any good strip shows lately? Look what we found. Bobby! Waste him. No! Holy shit! He stopped the bullet. All right. In here, guys! I got him! Watch your head, pal. Howie! Well, that wraps it up here, charlie. Did you check backstage? Now that this is over, if the cardinal is elected pope, you'll be on your way to rome. Oh, I don't know. It depends on how they respond to my behavior over the last couple days. Before I leave, I just really want to thank you for saving my life. That's ok. You were incredible. I'll never forget it. How can I ever thank you? Would you sleep with me? Thank you. Oh, you're very welcome. If things were different... You certainly are a difficult man to get in touch with. You've been moping around the house for weeks now. I want to stay home and watch the ball game. You're long overdue for some socializing. Hi, bobby. Well, I feel like watching the submarine races on the charles. How about it, wills? Care to come along? You guys run. Have fun. Come on, wills. Pick up a chick. Pick up a babe. I don't want to pick up a babe, bob. Oh, how about that blonde? Bobby, what do you think? Cusp of taurus and gemini. Preston. Just a minute. Single or married? Single. What are you doing? Please. This is very interesting. Does she have a boyfriend? No, not since '79. Preston, you're always talking about misuse of the gift. Misuse smisuse. Don't be such a stuffed shirt. This is taking too much time. Miss, what's your sign? Things are different. [Murray] Uh, excuse me. I know this is the last voice you want to hear. I'll make it short and sweet. I met this entity on the other side. She's supposed to be originally from atlantis. Atlantis, atlantic city, what the hell's the difference? She's got a nice astral body. Looks like bobby's shaping up better. I feel like I'll be spending more time on the other side of the white light. I came to say good-bye. That's all you have to say? Come on! You never had a bad day? Bobby! Bobby. Bobby! Get over here now, bobby. Come on. What are you doing with her? She's a little old for you. [Murray] Oh, what a day! What a day, but it's nice. He's got a girl, he's got a girl, he's got a girl. Whoa! Wait a minute. How you doing, ladies? Nice halos. Hey, hey! Watch where you're flapping those wings! Yo, wills! I forgot to mention something. If she ever rolls over in the middle of the night asking for ice cream, just say no! Ha ha ha!
