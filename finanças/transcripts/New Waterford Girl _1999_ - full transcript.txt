I wasn't really born here, you know. When I was a tiny infant, my real mother, a famous opera singer, dropped me from a silver jet, as she passed over what she saw as a beautiful, tropical coastline. God's Country. I'm only going into Sydney and right back home to feed the dogs, Mooney. Yeah, I know. Lexter Joseph and Bonnie Marie, will you love and honour each other as man and wife for the rest of your lives? We will. You've declared your consent before the church. My brother Lexter barely knows Bonnie up there. Since everyone realized Bonnie wasn't just larding up from french fries, it's been insane. That's her dad in the coffin. Lexter had two choices: Ignore the whole thing and Bonnie go to Antigonish to have it incognito, or get married. ...faith unto her husband, may abide in Thy peace... She's been doing that all day. You're man and wife. Go ahead! Kiss the bride! All right, come in here! Everyone together. Ask me anything. I know that fine Italian Espresso has an unbroken cream on it. I know the street map of Paris by heart. Paris, Berlin, New York, Barcelona, Oslo – ask me anything. ...want to be on the pictures with us? Mooney! Oh, another envelope! With sympathy! Can't we keep the piles separate? This is supposed to be the happiest day in my life! Oh, Bonnie! Lexter says it's cheaper to have her dad's wake and the wedding all in one go. Cheaper... 100 bucks! Well, thanks... whoever. Jesus Christ on a hot plate! There she is. Can we go to the wedding part of the house, now? Yeah, hurry it up, Cookie. The liquor's in the kitchen. We gotta put a good face on it for poor Barbara's father in there. Ma, it's Bonnie. - All right, welcome to our family. - It might be easier to remember if our boy knowed her longer before he got friendly with her. Hey! The family's all together! Yes, we are. - Lexter,... - Yeah? Good luck! Thank you. Jesus, Saint! Would you open it up, already! We're not cowards in this town! I'll tell you that right now. He was a good man. - Mooney, you're not going, are you? - I'll be right back. Pickles, wait! What am I supposed to do? ...and then you spent that money I gave you for diapers on cigarettes! Pretend you can't see them. You're gonna be killed doing that! I can't hear you. Don't stop on my account! My brother Felix thinks I'll stop him from killing the visiting kid from Sydney. It's none of my business. Mooney, go watch the door! Hey, hey, I'll take that! Darcy, take that suitcase! Grab that, Darcy! Man, this is great! So you gonna give me the grand tour? Okay... My house, your house. There's the shore, the mine, the main drag. Hospital, tavern, church, tavern, church, church, rink, school, train station, road to Sydney. Filthy Scottish coal will line your lungs with gifts of blackness that will weight you to the bottom of the pits. But, Satan, coal is our primary industry! When coal is used as fuel, our homes are heated with the clean and efficient... Hey! Coal is killing you all! And I say unto thee: those who are afraid of the power of ignitious fuel will shrivel, crumbling like black slag from a locomotive engine going in circles! Well, I liked it, anyway. Not bad. Thanks, Joey. Class is over, Joey. Go eat some halibut! Yes, sir. You don't have to be mean to him! Tell him you'll marry him, then. That'll cheer him up. - Did you eat more of that chili? - What else am I supposed to eat? Did you like my presentation? Why is it all "me, me, me"? Do you have a wet towel? It was brilliant. It made me a heart attack. Thanks. What am I gonna do? That chili's 3 weeks old. Stop eating it! You're a little bossy, you know that? I better go. You'll make a great nurse someday. Yeah, I will. Fine! Go home, study up on the bedpan! - You're an artist. - I wish you'd stop saying that. Too late. Have you heard anything new? Not yet, but we will. It'll never work. Mr. Sweeney sends my homework to all schools in North America, thinking I'll be discovered. He sent my St Teresa essay to Montreal. It's embarrassing. Well, here's Mooney. Felix, would you go there and turn it down? Sweetheart, we got you a little something. Let me open it for you. Just hold it up to you, there. Look! Yeah, that's nice. - Oh, it suits you, Mooney! - That's something else, Moon! Thank you. Sure, I'll be a nurse. I'll wander around town covered in blood all the time. Right mental. Right off my nut! Archaeological survey in Ixtapa, Mexico. That's my first choice. Nuclear physics in Saskatchewan. Home economics in the Northwest Territories. Montreal – 5.3 to qualify. Now? Okay. No problem. These aren't my regular shoes. It's just Felix playing with the little fellow next door. I saw whats-her-name, the outfit on her. What's she trying to prove, eh? Darlene, sweetie, don't brush your hair at the breakfast table, honey! So, Mooney... Lexter? Oh, above the sink! No, this... yeah. - So, Mooney... - Lexter? Would you stop with the Mexico sign? Mooney, that's a joke, right? You never know. Maybe I'm practising. What, if I get a scholarship? Yeah, like that'll happen! She doesn't know any better. She should. It's embarrassing! Why don't you go next door? Yeah, take some banana bread and give us the scoop. Why is it always me? Oh, Agnes-Marie! They'll be gone in a month. Honey, I don't understand you anymore. When you were little, you were so friendly and outgoing. Thanks. You're welcome. Now, remember, girls: I'm 29. Where are you from? Bronx. New York? Yeah, we're only here until the stink blows off of us. Right, sweetie? Mum! Bye. So... - Whats your story, Mooney Pottie? - That's the virgin Mary. Oh, sorry. You're not catholic? No, but whatever it takes, I love it here! Yeah... it's home. I made a friend! Yes, now, the ovaries. Be sure to finish your ovary diagram by tomorrow, Lisa. You're not getting any more extensions. The rest of the projects were just lovely! Agnes-Marie Pottie added sparkles to the fallopian tubes. It's different, isn't it? Very expressive. Oh, here we have the... male... body. Uh... Mooney? Mooney Pottie, get down to see Cecil Sweeney right away at the office. Someone died, I bet. Mr. Sweeney wants to fuck a friend. Guess what! No! Absolutely not! You're only 15 years old! And you're not mentally stable. You've been cracked ever since you come back from Toronto. I never went to Toronto! That was Betty-Anne, and she never even left the hotel room. Why do you want to torture yourself about this, child? We don't want to discuss it any further! It's an arts high school in Manhattan... New York! In the States? In the States! Are you listening to this? It's paid for. It's supervised. You can't even be normal in a town this size! I'm normal. Francis, I think we'd better make a trip to the doctor. Doctor?! Listen to me! We all had dreams, you know? All of us! Do you think we just woke up one morning and there was 5 kids there?! - What did you dream about, dad? - I dreamed I'd have somewhere to piss! Cecil Sweeney came here a few years ago to "find himself". That's what he told me: He's finding himself. I bring him things like Ma's date squares, our old kettle, a short-wave radio I found in the garbage. He'll know what to do. Hi. Can I talk to you? Sure. Hey, white suits you. - What's that? Food? - No. Lexter's boots. He's done with them. Is he? These boots are too big. Tough! What's wrong with you? I don't know what I was thinking. What do you mean? I can't go to New York. Why not? - It's breaking their hearts. - Oh! That's normal. Not for me. - Maybe you could say something... - No, I can't talk to your parents. Why not? Look, I got you the scholarship, now it's up to you. You could convince them I'm not crazy because you're a teacher! Yeah, who wants to seduce you. Pardon? You'll figure it out. Use that imagination! I need your help! Don't yell at me. - I'm not yelling. - You don't need me at all. If you wanna go to New York, then you go to New York, okay? I'm the guy who lives in the trailer. No-one's listening to me. - What's the matter with you? - Nothing is the matter with me! This is it! This is me – out of school. I don't exactly leap out of that roll-away bed in the morning. Okay. Well, thanks for all your help, sir! Hey! Where are you going? My mother's taking me to doctor Hogan's. Why? Shit! Shit! Shit! He'll be sorry! They'll all be sorry! He better hope he doesn't land up in the hospital when I'm on my shift! I tell you that right now! You can tell your mother that this should calm you right down. It's a boy, was it? He upset you? I don't care about boys. Oh, God! I really should get this cut looked at, I suppose. Jesus, this ought to be good: Dance classes to cultivate the natives. Hi. Look at that hair on her! Hey! Hey, there! When are you leaving town? I wanna mark it on my calendar. Hey, where are you going? Get back here! What are you – on vacation? Try living here when it's hailing. Yeah, ice pellets spiking in the eye! Hey, she's watching you. Clever! She's quick. I'll give her that much. Hey! There goes Tammy MacDonald off to her aunts in Californ-i-a. You wouldn't catch me crying if I got to leave. I'd smile and wave goodbye. Bears also appear to be intelligent. Whether they are more intelligent than their near relatives, the cats and dogs... Hey, come on champ, put this over to 9, please. Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's it! Thank you. All right, go play in the traffic. Mooney? Did you take your nerve pills? Mooney, Remember junior A hockey wanted me to go to Toronto? I never went, did I? No, you didn't, Lexter. They couldn't get me, no matter how much they tried. That's how you gotta be. Mooney, it's a good thing they couldn't send you on that Europe trip. Tammy MacDonald got, you know. They sent her away to have it. Tammy went on vacation to her aunts in California. I saw her get on the train. She's hopeless. That's it! Can you just let me watch the goddamn game? Can you shut up, goddamn it? Why can't I just be... alone?! Mooney, go to your room! I don't have a room! I sleep in the hall! Remember? Cookie? Cookie! Hey, drama queen! Check it out! I got it going! Do you want to go for some fries? Fries... Sure. Why not? Oh, um... doors don't open. So, you go rowing much? - Rowing? - Yeah. Yeah, all the time. That's what we all do: row, fish, do the jig, collect pogey... Okay, okay, it just sounds nice to me, okay? Oh my gosh, look at the butt on that guy... hello! Oh my God! I can see Fraggles from here. Look at that! Hey-up, Fraggle-boy! - Just drop me off! - Look at that... Don't! That's Joey! Oh! Hello, Joey! He's cute! Turn up here! OK, I'm turning, Don't worry about it. Stop The car! Turn around! What is this? This is number 11 field. We go back now. That was the whole strip? Yeah. Okay, so on the way back, we just pretend we're different guys? I think they remember me. Hey, keep me informed of the latest developments, will you? What? You've heard me. Hey, Pottie! You know, I could really go for a J&J chicken burger right about now. For the love of God, I just put a cooked dinner in front of you! - Dad... - What? Can we go to a party this weekend? What are all you guys doing in this house? Shouldn't you be out there getting a job and your own place? - How old are you? - I don't know. Am I talking to the wall here? How old are you? - I'm 8, just started grade 3. - Old enough for the mines! So we can go to the party, right? Will they have the lights on this time? They don't turn the lights off at the parties, do they? No, it's gross! Mooney, are you going to go to this party? Pardon? Sweetheart, you gotta get out and start enjoying yourself. You need this book at the table? Whats going on with that? - Sorry. - Don't you spill that milk, girl! Use your knife. You wouldn't want to let my wife see you doing that. Well, if they knew how to cook eggs around here, I wouldn't have to. Oh yeah? So, how is it they cook 'em where you come from? No dance class? Where is everyone? I have no idea. And another thing... There are no delis here. No prosciutto, no mozzarella. No pumpernickel – no nothing! So what? I'll just make you a bologna sandwich. Okay. On squishy white bread, - with cheese-glue. - Great! A little petroleum salad dressing? Thank you. The champ would really love this. Right now, he's champing down in some prison - cafeteria on something better than that. - 2 years now. I can't believe self-defence is 2 years. - I can't believe you picked this place. - You'd rather see him every week and spend the rest of the time crying about how damn skinny he's getting? He'll always look good to me. Nice room. It's not a room. Nice nurse's uniform? Okay, here's the word. Your sisters tell me there's a party. And? Well... nurses are really handy at parties. - Vomiting, there's accidental cuts... - No! Come on. Where do we get supplies? - Supplies? - Yeah, supplies! Can we uh... buy something? Yeah. Come on! Where's she from? Down the shore. I love it here, though. God's Country... Goddamn right. Someone cleaned me out of rum! Wait a sec! Handsome. Handsome! You wanna go to a party? You girls are in luck! Because I have a bottle of the house finest! Still warm! It's hot, actually. Yeah, because it was by the stove! Good that way, though. Warm you up! Thanks, sir. Mooney! They let you out, did they? Let's go! - I changed my mind. - Oh gosh, c'mon! Spin the bottle? This is good here. You ready? Okay? I can't do this. Lesson number 1: Take this chick outside! It's just because I'm pregnant. They let you out, eh? Hot stuff coming through! I was telling Mooney here, they're all little fuckers, eh? But you know that. Some of them are okay. Yeah, but you never fall in love with them ones. It's just the little bastards that you fall in love with. Jesus, where have you been? Manhattan, now look at her. Welcome to Cape Breton! I gotta go to Antigonish, eh? That's my aunt: "Have the thing, give it away!" But him? That little fucker just gets padded on the head. "Good boy", they say. – Who's gonna get her guts ripped out? - You! - That's right, me. Then I gotta pretend like nothing happened. I gotta go back to school. It's the only way I can still go to mass. That's too bad. But you get out of here. That's something! Yeah, but I'm going to miss all the parties. You know what? I prayed to the virgin Mary that he'd be punished. Despite that couldn't help it! He's a fucker! Where is he? Give him my car keys and get him wasted. And maybe he'll drive himself into a pole! Out of my way! We should go now, Lou. It is just getting good! - Mooney likes that! - I do not. Do you believe in hell? 'Cause I'm going to hell if I keep thinking like this. Like what? I think God is giving me an idea. Everyone wants me to be normal? I'll show them normal! Hello. Check out the posters! Okay. Hot, eh? I'm cold, actually, but feel free, because temperature is so subjective. What's your name? Guess! - Cynthia? - No. - Carolyn? - No. Brenda? Your turn. Stay right there. I don't think so. Because temperature controlling, that's why slippers were invented. To regulate the temperature. He tastes like... barbecue chips. Sally? Heidi? Daisy? - Daisy? Yeah, that's me. - Daisy! Tell me a bit about yourself. About me? Oh God! I'm a girl, I like spicy food, I have a Mexican wrestling card collection. So is it true your father is locked up? I heard he went totally nuts. - Shut up! - I heard that nobody wants to come near. I mean, the guys are saying... She just knocked him! Sorry! He'll be fine. Just throw some ice on him or something! - See? - Mickey! - Not a problem, you know. - Great party. See you all at school! Bye. Fucking Ontario lesbo bitch! - Holy shit! - We're dead! He was guilty! What do you mean? If they're guilty, they fall. That's what my dad always says. Where's your dad? It's pretty cold out here. We should probably get going. Why'd you come here? It's where the railroad tracks ended. - Admit it. - What? You had fun. Well... - Meeker took his shirt off. - All right! - And folded it! - Oh, my God! Good score! She's wasted. There's some things you'll have to know if you're start going out. - That's okay. - No, listen to me! If a guy says it's his belt buckle poking you, it isn't. It's something else. In a car, when they take you to number 11 field, don't go there. People only go there to do it. You'll definitely get into trouble. But if someone makes you go there, roll down the window a bit so the windshield doesn't get fogged up. But lock the doors. But I think, if you're technically swept away, it's only a venial sin, not a mortal sin. Really? Mooney, be careful! Or you'll get a holy, unveiled vacation. If you know what I mean. Straight to Antigonish. All right? This is our wisdom. Thank you. My idea is devious, sinful and inspired. I wish I had a bunch of sisters to sit around and chat with when I was young. You pounded her boyfriend at the party. People don't appreciate visitors coming here just to fight. That's how we get our bad reputations. Look, I'm sorry, okay? I'm going home, now, okay? Hey, wait! We just want to thank you. I love him, but it sure was good to see him get punched in the ass! We want to ask you something. Do you know Pickles Kavanaugh? Pickles? Look, maybe you could... you know? I don't know if I can do that again. It was just a fluke. I told them you knocked him out because the virgin sent you. He's really short. So are you gonna do it? You guys are all catholic, right? And you know it's a sin to fight. - I don't think so. - No, no, no, boxing is like... It's like sports and recreation. Father Madden used to mud wrestle with the bishop from Fays Lane. So what did this pickles guy do wrong? He two-timed on me with Noreen. Only 20 times now. Look, we really appreciate it. Let's say I do this – Does it mean I'm like a local now? - No. - Why not? You weren't born here. Okay, I'll do it. What?! Hey! - Is this the boxing club? - Yeah. So you guys use standing eight-counts, or what? We let them kill each other, pretty much. Oh. This guy in there? No, he isn't. And you better move on now. Forget about Pickles! Do you see what I see? Lou! Hi! I was um... looking for my brother. I'm Lou. Thanks anyway! - Did you see what I just saw? - Yeah, nice home team, Mooney Pottie! You all right, bud? How much you got, Noreen? 10 from my little sister. She's always working. Whats wrong with her? I know, she's a freak. You wouldn't catch me working that hard. Hey! This you? Yeah. He's way taller than she said. Yeah, I'm tall, eh? - Patty sent me. - Frigg off! You promised her you'd buy her a crib. Yeah, and then I'm gonna buy her a pony. Wow! Man! He is guilty. Guilty of what? That's the proof right there! Come on. Why are we running? What time is it, please? 3:20. my leg's asleep. 7 hours in here! I have a question. Good, a question. If I have a dream that I should do something – is it a sin to ignore that dream? Oh, well, every dream comes from God. For example... Some people want a little terrier and... get called names. And some people want... the long hair. - Hi, Mooney. - Hey, Joey. - Meet me behind Baffin's later? - Really? Yeah, later. What Time later? I always knew you liked me. You were after me, wanted to jump me. Just stand over there, for Frigg's sake! Way over here? This far enough? - Joey, no offence! - What, Moo-Moo? I don't want to do anything. Can we just talk? It was always you I liked. - Really? - I did! I just got lonely, eh. How'd you like it if I told all the boys you tried to jump me? Fine! Do it, then. You're playing head games! You know what, Mooney Pottie? Lots of cool girls from Sydney and Glace Bay and at the reserve, they call me up all the time. Jeez, that looks good. She is mental. Oh, hi! - Hi! - You didn't have to wait for me. - Mooney, your shirt's undone! - Jeez, Mooney! Now that my reputation in town is taking a steep nose-dive, it's perfect. And as fast as I'm getting known for changing "mental" into "slut", Lou is becoming every mad girl's "revenge for hire". Sometimes there's overlap. What are we having? You have beautiful eyes. Go on – I do not! Love it, man! Hey! Oh! You waiting for me? No. Shit, this small is so town. - I mean this town is so small. - Yeah! Yeah! It really is. Is this you? No, that's my brother. No, that's you! Cause I know your brother and he's a real sweetheart. Who sent you to find me, then? Was it Jennifer or Julia? Two? They chipped in. Fuck! Just stand still. It'll hurt less. - Stop The car. - What? Mooney, look: I think people are sufficiently confused about what guys... I got her, too. Me too. Develop alcoholism early on? Excellent! How'd you get in here? The door guy, friend of Lou's. How'd you get in? I'm on recess. Hey, listen to me. They're going to want to send me away. So save my scholarship, buddy-boy! What will happen to me if you go? You'll have to live your own life, I guess. You know that I'm in love with you? Pretty funny, eh? Talk to me when you grow up! Okay. 1st prize: Quarter side of beef. 2nd prize: 10 pounds of T-bone steaks. 3rd prize: 5 pounds of pork chops. Meat darts. Get it? The meat! Agnes-Marie, I had my eggs in that tavern this morning! For the love of God, it couldn't be Mooney. She was drunk, for God's sakes! That's impossible, she's only a 15 year-old youngster! One question, young Lady: Everyone of the kids is happy except for you! Why is that? What's your problem? Stop it! Listen: You just tell me where you were, - and we'll straighten it out from there... - She was with Cecil Sweeney! You don't even know what he's up to! I was at the bar. No, you were not at the bar! You tell me where you were right now! That was me. - She was with us. - What do you mean? She was with us, yeah. No. Thanks Darlene. Ma, I was at the bar, and I was... I wasn't drunk. Liar! She ran into the bar to use the phone! Oh, my God! Woman! I threw up, because... Because? I think I'm pregnant. God knows who the father is! - What was she saying? - She's been a whore! Mind your mouth! Now, Agnes-Marie,... you're a virgin. Agnes-Marie? Technically... Technically? You don't even know what's happening! You don't see what he's up to! She's being taken advantage of by everyone. That's by goddamn Sweeney! That's who! Jesus! - Jesus! - Is it really Cecil Sweeney? I would have thought it would have been one of you two. - Frigg off! - Hey, I'm above the waist. - Yeah, right! - Yeah! What's wrong, Felix? I don't know. No one'll tell me. All right. Okay, honey. We're gonna take you to doctor Hogan for a test. Test? Sweet mother of God, I'm with you. Are you coming, or what? "Make me do anything you want..." "Make me be everything you want"... Tammy, I saw you get on the train! Got homesick, wants the kid, busted out of there. Right, Tammy? "Make me do anything you want..." ... and then I find out that he has 3 kids already! He said that he had a vasectomy! Jesus! - Sure he didn't say "tonsillectomy"? - No! Oh my God – that's him! Lou, don't! Don't! Lou? He looks nice! Doesn't he? Hello! Excuse me. You know that girl? Nope. Take a look! Oh, that's my buddy's daughter. I haven't seen her since... ...since you put a bun in her oven and made her swear not to tell! What? Prepare yourself, buddy. Who are you? Look at you! You're a grown man with a... with a tie. She's a 16-year-old girl! She's a little liar! Birthmark on his ass! There goes my free rides to Sydney and back. I got you a present ... for the test. I thought you liked girls, and that you were special. What? Never mind. So what will you do now, my dear? They'll send me to Antigonish and make me have it. And what about the fellow? Which fellow? Well, good luck to you. Should I have an ab... You know, I wouldn't tell anyone. You know, an abo... Ow! Please don't mention that disgusting idea in this office! I'm gonna burn in hell... And, Miss Pottie, I strongly suggest that you perform penance immediately! Help! Help! Somebody help Darcy! Help! He's all bloody! Help! Quick! Look at him! He's all bloody! You're not supposed go laugh, fag! You're going home! You're a slut! Moo, stop! That hurts! Something wrong with someone making a goddamn cake? No, dad. Goddamn right. There you go, champ. Top her up for your good old dad. Easy! What's this – the legion? Yes, sir! Thank you! We won't tell poor Felix, he'll just be too confused when there's no baby brought back. If only we had more room, we could... But I suppose we couldn’t anyway. I mean, that would ruin your whole life. I know. I don't mind. God forgive me, darling, but sometimes... Sometimes I worry about your mind, Agnes-Marie. I wish you'd call me Mooney again. Why don't you just go to bed now, okay? I don't want to talk to you right now, okay? Dad? Everyone's snapped. You don't have to go. And into the evening the courting begins I wish I was with them again. Out on the Mira on warm afternoons old men go fishing with black line and spoons. And if they catch nothing they'll never complain. I wish I was with them again. Can you imagine a piece of the universe more fit for princes and kings? I'll trade you ten of your cities for Marion Bridge and the pleasure it brings. As boys in the boats call to girls on the shore, teasing the ones that they dearly adore... Hey, Mooney, over here! Hi, Mooney. We were just talking about you. Oh, great! I mean, you know... Talk away! I'm grounded! And I didn't even get to feel you up! We gotta go. Yeah, we started talking. We found out you were weird with all of us. You always knew I was weird, Joey! I feel dirty. You guys should all be proud! Okay, let's go. We don't like being accused of things! You don't? Well. Who knows who I fooled around with? Yeah, look at her. She's a slut! Shut up! We're gonna tell her folks she's been faking. -What do you care? - It's our reputations! - Lou, hit them! - They didn't do anything. They can't tell anyone! Everything is set and I'm going tomorrow. Okay-dokey, captain! See? I didn't do anything! None of us did! Try Meeker! Fuck! Shit, that hurt! See? If we're guilty, we fall, right? - It's true. - We're innocent! I'm a virgin! - What? - Nothing. She's probably not even knocked up. That's not true! I'm knocked up. So, you want us to spare you, eh? Yeah, that would be great! Then you gotta do us a favour. Sure! How about some laundry or some tutoring, perhaps. So, she can fight Sandy MacPhee. Excuse me? We'll keep this all about Mooney quiet, if you can pound him. He's a real boxer. It'll be at the club. It's all set up. They don't know our guy's gonna get sick. Mickey would have died in round 2. Normally, I like to have a picture, because without a picture, I can't... You fight Sandy for New Waterford, we keep things quiet. I can't do this anymore, Mooney. I can't fight a real boxer. You don't have to, Lou. But I do. This is crazy. I wish we had some sort of sign. This was my mother's sweater. She was wearing it when she died after she ate a grilled cheese sandwich. That's not really helpful to us in any way, is it? I don't think so. He looked good, though. Yeah, he did. Listen, the blessed virgin Mary sent her here to New Waterford. God wants us to have the title. Of course, he does. I know who your father was. If you want to lead them on that you're a holy spirit, lead them. I have 80 bucks on you. Thanks. Please, don't hurt him. Did he do that to you? I put 10 bucks down on him. I hope he kills her! I put 40 on her. What are you – the cheerleader? You'll see! I can't fucking hit a girl! Settle down, now! Settle down! In the blue corner, for Sydney: Sandy MacPhee! You suck! And in the red corner, for New Waterford: Lou Benzoa! Boxers! Box! Ready? Look, just stand still, okay? It'll hurt less. Chin down! Get him, Lou! Hey! I'm done! Hey, everybody! Check it out! I'm not going anywhere! I'm staying right here! Take a good look! Dad! Dad! I told your dad you're a virgin. What? I'm saving you. I love you. I'm so sorry, Joey. Dad, stop it! He didn't do anything! - Hey! Sweeney! - He didn't do anything! Mooney, shut it! Mr. Sweeney, I have something to talk about with you. He's innocent, dad! He's innocent? Okay, prove it! What? He's the only one left. All boys in town told me you're just pretending. Is that true? If he falls, he's guilty, am I right? Is that how it works? I want you to knock him out. Knock-out punch like I saw it downtown. Right now you hit him one! Go on! He's down. He's bloody down! That was a lame dive, buddy. Shut up! Wait! Listen to me. I have to tell you something. Mooney!

"Dear Agnes-Marie, you be a good girl in New York City. No-one else home knows that you're anywhere but Antigonish. I guess I'll break it to them eventually. We all love you very, very much. Ma." Ask me anything. I know Lexter Pottie cried with happiness when they named the triplets Rudy, Joey and Brenda. I know all the street names. I know how to re-use a tea bag. I know what they do up number 11. I know how to beat the crap out of someone. I know all about God's Country. Ask me anything. - Subtitles by Belch - Pretty party! Isn't this great?
