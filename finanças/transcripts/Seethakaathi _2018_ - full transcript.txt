(Lava Kusa.) Brother! Without my knowledge, I am consumed by sorrow. I don't know the reason. When I see this King, who has come for war, mourn over the death of his brother, I feel miserable. The pain we feel, when we see sorrow in our mother's face, that's exactly how I am feeling, seeing the misery on this King's face. To be precise, I feel more affectionate towards this King, than the affection I feel towards our mother. No matter, how much I mentally prepare myself, I don't have the courage to wage war, against this King. My hands are unable to shoot the arrow. What do we do about this miserable condition? (Kovalan's Story.) I have killed, Pandian, Vanjipithan, and the evil minister, those who killed my husband, just as my heart desired. Apart from those, elders of Madurai, residing in the town, who are fair, pure women, the children, the learned and disciplined honourable people, the birds and the animals, let the rest burn to ashes!!! My dear, my life, my love! Once you go there, (Satyavan Savitri.) because of your father or mother, (Satyavan Savitri.) or because of any other important reason, if you forget me, will it be possible for me to stay alive? It won't be isn't it? If you're fine with me dying, then you go there. My crooning temple pigeon, my gem, please don't suspect me. I will go there as fast as possible, meet my mother and father, pay my respects and come back to you soon. This is a promise. Please let me go. My Savitiri, please let me go. So many people are coming, Aadhimoolam. Why don't you act in films? As long as I can, I wish to perform directly in front of the audience. Appreciation or criticism, you get it immediately. Not just that, I am content, here. (Interrogation.) In the salary that has been given to you, (Interrogation.) you have fed others and also have given money. From the salary I receive, I can feed whoever I want, I can give money to whoever I want. I think no one has the right, to question me. Not even for the government? The money you're receiving, belongs to the government. What I receive is my salary. Those who you are helping, are people, who the government dislikes. Let it be. Those seem to be the people I like. Not just that, they are not unlawful people. They are part of a legit movement. Let it be... They are my friends! Could be, but you can't favour them. A government employee, should only favour, those who the government likes. Those who the government dislikes, he should also dislike! Please explain in a way I can understand. I am saying, that the citizens of a country, shouldn't function against their government! So you are saying... So you are saying, we should be slaves. Not possible! We can't accept this! The government should function for me, for you, and for the people, and not, us functioning for the government! Am I right? (SEETHAKAATHI) The final stages of Aurangzeb's life, he who had considered all art forms unnecessary, had banned them during his regime. (Aurangzeb) Who is there? Come and play it, in front of me! I will bury you and your music! Abul Muzaffar Muhy-ud-Din Muhammad Aurangzeb Bahadur Alamgir, Badshah Ghazi! Soldiers! Soldiers! No one will come Alamgir! No use, calling them. Who are you? I was right there in front of you, during your childhood, I was always playing at your ear's distance. You chased me away! Now I stand alone, grieving. Music! Music! You, who are existing as a voice, take, form and appear. I need to talk to you. Why are you laughing? When you approached me with the sword, I thought you were again trying to kill me. A sword just to lift a veil! Looking at your savage taste, how can I not laugh! Who are you? Tell the truth! Why? Are you doubting whether, music can be present at the core of your soul? Just a while ago, you were mesmerized listening to the music. Why is that? You can't be without listening to my voice anymore. If you have to kill me... If I have to... Why did you stop, say it! You will have to commit suicide Badshah! How dare you have the guts, to talk about suicide to a true Muslim. True Muslim! True Muslim, is what you keep saying often. Badshah, do you keep doubting that? I have no doubts at all about that. I live exactly the way, The Quran states a Muslim should! I am a true Muslim! I have no doubts about that! Those who had called themselves Muslims, but disgraced Islam, I have killed them! Tara! His father's beloved Tara! He tried hard for Tara to be crowned and me to be hung! But... But Tara's head was hung in the middle of the road! A fool who never accepted what he said or did was wrong, till the very end. I don't know what love is! No one taught me about it either. You just keep repeating this chant, in this vast kingdom, with no companion, standing alone, experiencing sorrow my dear Emperor! Loneliness... Loneliness... Loneliness! Yes it is true. I have no companion. Yes it is true. That I trust no one. That is also true. My own son is my enemy and my darling daughter his ally. That is also true! My loneliness! Now you understand? This is what Shah Jahan would also have said. I did not hate my son like the way my father hated me! When that's the case, why has he become my enemy? I dreamt of, One Nation, One religion, One language, for the good of everyone. Everything failed. Like you said, I am experiencing loneliness. From the top of my reign, I look down. All I see is just emptiness! You find what I am saying, funny? From the top of my reign, I look down. All I see is just emptiness! Wow! What beautiful poetry! Like music another enemy of yours is poetry. From the way you're talking, it seems like, she too is on her way here! Why you trying to confuse me? Please, leave... leave... Leave... The One who possesses, empathy and sympathy. The Almighty Allah! The One who rules this universe! All the praise belongs to you! On judgement day, The Almighty who pronounces justice! Show us the path of righteousness. When I came, I came empty handed. As I leave, I carry a heavy baggage of sin! To wash away the blood stains on my hands, the water flowing through the entire Yamuna river, won't be enough. Definitely it won't be enough! Who, is the reason for all this? Am I a religious fanatic? Is it the greed for power? Or am I an orphan yearning for love? I am confused... Apart from you, I have no one. What motivated me to commit so many murders? What? It is not my responsibility to analyze reasons. History, will have to tell! Incidents are appearing before my eyes. I am a tired old man. I, myself, have become history now!!! Aurangzeb. Ayya. You did well! Bless you! Thanks Ayya. Bless you! Bless you! Bless you! Bless you! You performed really well Mohana. - Thanks. Is your son coming to pick you up? - No. - Then let's leave together. The play is over, what are you still doing? Ayya. It was brilliant. If it continues like this, finally you will be the only one watching . This won't be enough, even to pay the auditorium rent. What's the point in being brilliant? Nothing like that, definitely more people will come. Just that, in today's times, we need to advertise. To reach the people. Like there are film advertisements in the newspapers. Why don't we also advertise our plays in a big way? No... no... don't worry about the money, Kannan, working at the newspaper, said he will take care of it. Once the situation gets better we can return it. He only suggested it. Okay, go ahead. All of you performed well. Thank you Ayya!!! Bless you! Ranga. Ayya. Lakshmi said she saw you on TV. I just went for a day Ayya. I was not comfortable. Why? After being like a king here... There... I just couldn't do it. Ayya, he only took me there. Oh you! Sit down. It's okay Ayya, I will stand, If you keep standing, my neck will pain. Sit down. Will you perform well on stage tomorrow? I will do it, exactly the way you have taught me. If you're going to do only what I taught you, why are you required... You should be individualistic. Where is Mohana? Ayya. Have they fixed the date? No Ayya. That didn't work out. Why? They wanted me to stop acting after the marriage. So I said no. Did the family members ask you or the groom? The family members. You talk to the groom once and then decide. Okay, Ayya. Okay let's meet tomorrow. Okay, Ayya. Thank you. - Gopal, shall we leave. - Okay. See you, Gopal. Puneetha. Dad. When did you come? In the afternoon dad. Why you washing clothes at this hour? Got a little late, dad. Has your husband come? He hasn't come, dad. Why you looking dull? Nothing, dad. Has my darling come? He is inside. Tarun. Grandpa! My darling! Lakshmi, give me some water. Come to me, my darling. Come to me, my darling. You came in the afternoon itself? Why, did you not go to school today? Why? I went to the hospital. Hospital? Why? I had another attack this morning. That's why mum and me came here. They are going to do an operation. Have you eaten? Puneetha. Dad. Did he have fits again this morning? Yes. No... no... your eyes will hurt. What did the doctor say? They took a scan. There is a lump in his brain. They said it has to be operated. Okay. Don't worry. Nowadays all this is not complicated. Shall we consult another doctor? No dad. He is the specialist, in Chennai. He said, earlier it's done the better. Okay. Okay, let me talk to your husband. He has also asked for a loan at office. It will cost around 4 to 5 lakhs. I don't how I am going to arrange for the balance amount. Okay. The doctor said everything will be fine, right? Lakshmi. So much has happened, why didn't you inform me? She came only in the afternoon. At that time you will be in the auditorium, did not want to come there and call you. Have I told you not to call me? Not just that, we were asking a few people, for the money. That's why I forgot. You go change your clothes, and come to eat, your dinner is ready. Mani. Ayya. - Is your health better? - It is better. - If not, shall I ask Mohan to play your part? - No need Ayya. I will act. - Everything's ready? - Everything is ready Ayya. What... After the advertisement, about ten more people would have come? That's not wrong, lets go. Sujatha's "Unjal". Directed by Ayya. Aadhimoolam. Why you talking about postponing the wedding? - Are you playing the fool? - Yes, Giri, we have to postpone our wedding. By how many days? Shall we keep it next week? Days... Months... why, it could even take years. I agree, that yesterday my mum just sat like Ho Chi Minh! But that doesn't mean she is not interested in the wedding, Kalyani! - Giri, your mother is not the reason. - Then? My father wishes to conduct the wedding in an ideal manner, bearing the expenses on his own. Don't mistake me, something's wrong with that old man. Giri! All of you will never understand my father. You haven't left as yet? Welcome Giri. When did you come? I came five minutes back. She's talking about postponing the wedding, ask her? She never told me anything. - I decided only at night, mom. - About what? First, let dad finish the prototype, only after that. Money? I am going to give the money. Which I saved for the wedding. I think you're making a mistake . I am not making a mistake, If you can't wait, tell me. Tell me now. You please wait. This looks like something new is happening between father and daughter. Let him come, we can ask him. I will leave and come later. Giri. Listen to this and then leave. Kalyani. You also listen to this. Tell your mother that she can cry later, and to now listen to this carefully. I decided last night itself. To take up the job offered by Mathivathanam. - Dad! - Don't interrupt! I asked you for money, but did you think I would take it? No... I asked... Just to see, how much trust you have in me. But you, the minute I asked, you immediately said, that you would withdraw the money, you had saved for your wedding, and give it to me tomorrow. That's when you proved, you're my daughter. Instead of dismissing me as an useless old man, you trusted me, that's enough! I don't have to prove anything to anyone. If there is one soul who believes in me, that's enough. Dad, that's alright dad. I will get the money and come, you attempt it once more, dad. Dad! Ayya. Ayya. " Oh! Ayya! What are you gazing at?" " For so long!!! " " Is your entire life," " like dry leaves," " falling down?" " All that love," " and those years of yearning..." " In a flash of a second..." " Like a dewdrop," " alone..." " Has it dried up?" " On the rock, the Brightest light," " lingers on and goes away." " All the sacrifices..." " Bow down," " and cry in silence!" " Life doesn't end with death..." Ayya...Ayya...Ayya... " Once the mirage," " is what you get used to as real." " Then..." " When a crystal clear river," " touches, you won't feel it." " Within." " The silence that has seen, the depth of depths..." " Can sound win it over?" " Till the end of time..." " A tree has its roots spread..." " Can it fall apart in death?" " In solitude you wept." " Where did you leave!!! " " Oh! King!!! " " As the makeup," " wore off..." " You became your own face is it?" " Art never respects death!!! " " The solitary reaper has fallen..." " On the bed of fire," " burning to ashes," " in solitude." " Is this the end?" You're listening to Munna! There is one happy and one sad news! First let me tell you the sad news. Theatre actor Aadhimoolam passed away a while ago. Don't ask me who is Aadhimoolam... Next... famous actor Surenkumar is going to reveal his new film's title tonight at 12am. "Legendary theatre actor Aadhimoolam, passed away today." "He was 73 years old." "He breathed his last as he was performing on stage." "His demise is an irreplaceable loss, for the arts community and the world of theatre," "said the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu." One month later... Through many difficulties, and no matter what, for more than fifty years, Ayya continuously staged plays in this auditorium. After his demise, to just abandon it, is troubling my conscience. Even if we aren't able to stage plays regularly, we should stage them occasionally, that's my wish. Ayya would have wished the same. Definitely. After Ayya's demise, us not performing on stage, feels like, we have lost everything. I am going for a job. Yes, money is important, but... I am not able to be without this. Why occasionally... Let's stage continuously. We were wondering, how to approach this topic with you. Thankfully, you called us. Okay, then shall we stage the plays this weekend? Yes let's do it! Let's start the rehearsals from tomorrow. Okay. Bheema! Are you saying this with a conscience? What are you talking? Where... and in front of whom! Your burning rage... has... "Has burnt your brains, hence you talk to the King of the three worlds, your brother, with such anger!" Has burnt your brains, hence you talk to the King of the three worlds... Hence you talk to the King of the three worlds, your brother, with such anger! Come Paanjaali, come sit on my thigh! She is the one who has married five of them! Where is the aide? Come here? Remove, the clothes of the Pandavas, and also remove her saree! Oh! Lord Kanna! Oh! Lord Kanna! Save me! Save me! I promise on the Gods in the skies! I promise on Goddess Parasakthi! I promise, this is what I am going to do. This impotent Duryodhanan, who dared, to ask, our beloved Paanjaali, who is equal to fire, shamelessly to come and sit on his thigh. This Duryodhanan, in front of all these disgraceful ministers, I will, with all my strength, I will split his thighs and kill him!!! I will rip apart, his disgusting brother Dushasanan's, shoulders! I will drink the blood that oozes from there. This is definitely going to happen! These are not words spoken by me. These are Goddess Parasakthi's words! This will be carried and blessed by the Goddess Parasakthi herself! This hateful Karnan, I will at war... Ranga, you were superb! Brother, saw how Rangan performed? - Ranga. - Brother. Brilliant! Superb! Superb! You should have performed like this, when Ayya was there. He would have been so happy. Okay, this is enough for today. Tomorrow, let's do a complete dress rehearsal, before the show. After he has lost, he has no right to lose me! After losing at a game of dice, on what grounds has he pledged me? From now I am Drupadan's daughter. You, who have lost at gambling, do you still have the right to call me your wife? Is there no one here who is righteous? Even before the truth was found, is justice dead? Is justice dead? In gambling houses, there will be servant maids. No one will ever pledge them and gamble. Brother! what were you thinking? Who have you pledged! Oh! Lord Kanna! Save me! Almighty! Save me! Oh! Lord Kanna! Oh! Lord Kanna! Save me! Save me! Oh! Lord Kanna!!! Save me! Save me! Oh! Lord Kanna! Oh! Lord Kanna!!! Save me! Save me! I promise on Goddess Parasakthi! That, the blood of Dushasanan, and the blood from Duryodanan's thigh, I will mix them both, and apply it on my hair! Only after I wash it off with aromatic oils, will I tie my hair! Till then I won't! This is a promise!!! Mohana this is the first time I have seen you act so well! You were even better than, Rangan's performance of yesterday. Bharathiyar's 'Paanjaali Sabatham'. (A Mythological play) Directed by Ayya.Aadhimoolam. Drupadan's daughter, and Dhrishtadyumnan's sister, how can she be equated to the roll of the dice! This is Cruelty! Cruelty!!! You have given her away as a slave to them! You have given her away! Go and get, a torch burning in flames. For pledging our fire, in gambling, let us burn our brother's hands! Bheema! Are you saying this with a conscience? What are you talking? Where... and in front of whom! Your burning rage, has burnt your brains, hence you talk, to the King of the three worlds, your brother, with such anger! Actions are going on and on, and we are watching, because we are tied today. Let's be patient. Time will definitely change. Then the world will witness justice being victorious!!! My hands hold the bow, brother! It's called the Kandeepam! On the battlefield, with all my strength, I will split his thighs and kill him!!! I will rip apart, his disgusting brother Dushasanan's, shoulders! This is definitely going to happen! Oh! World, you are going to witness it! These are not words spoken by me. These are Goddess Parasakthi's words! This will be carried and blessed by the Goddess Parasakthi herself! I will kill this hateful Karnan at war!!! I promise on Lord Kanna's holy feet!!! I promise on my lady's eyes, and I promise on my bow, Kandeepam. Oh! You earthly World! At the call of war!!! You are definitely going to witness, my extraordinary combat skills!!! Puneetha. Come inside for a minute. Ayya has not left us. He is here with us. Yesterday he came through Rangan. Then through Mohana. And now, you saw Arjunan's portrayal right? That's no one else, but our Ayya!!! What are you saying? Fifty years, he has lived on this stage. Will he just go away like that! He has not gone away from us. His soul is still here. He is still acting through someone. I am noticing that, for the past two days. For my sake, watch the play once more. Then you will understand. Who's that? A film director has come, he wants to meet you. I'm coming. Just a minute, I will be back. Hello sir. Hello. - My name is Thyagu. - Tell me sir. I am looking out for a hero, for my next film. I saw your play today. The actor who played Arjun's Character, was fantastic. He will be perfect for my story. I spoke to him, he asked me to talk to you. Just give us a minute. Sir, is this the first time you're watching this play? Yes sir. Can you do a small favour? Tell me sir. For my sake, just watch the play once more and then decide. Once more...? There's a reason for it. Okay sir. Directed by Ayya.Aadhimoolam. On stage, Ambi.Raghavan as Dharman, Ranga as Bheeman, Saravanan as Arjunan, Mohana as Paanjaali and Vignesh as Vigarnan. Is it fate, my husband! Following every ritual, and the sacred fire being a witness, you, willingly wedded me. To see me get destroyed by these rogues is it? In spite of such learned men, being in the court... Go and get, a torch burning in flames, for pledging our fire, in gambling, let us burn our brother's hands! burn our brother's hands! Bheema! Are you saying this with a conscience? What are you talking? Where... and in front of whom! Your burning rage, has burnt your brains, hence you talk, to the King of the three worlds, your brother, with such anger! Things are going on happening, and we are just watching, because we are tied today. Let's be patient. Time will definitely change. Then the world will witness justice being victorious!!! My hands hold the bow, brother! It's called the Kandeepam! Kings! reply to Draupadi's words. If we don't answer her questions, hell will burn us. Have our fathers ever sold their wives? Have we ever heard, of something as bizzare as losing our queens at gambling? But, our great generous King, after losing himself and becoming a slave. Doesn't have, a house or a wife or any other relations! When slavery is his only wealth. What else can he pledge to play with? This is what, the queen is questioning regarding her rights, to these cowards!!! I believe it sir! It has to be Ayya who acted. Before I made my first film, my father died. After that, wherever I go, I don't pray to any God. I pray to my father's photograph and then only leave. I still believe that my father is with me and taking care of me. When my father can be with me. Why can't Ayya be with all of you! I am not going to look for another actor. I will come with the advance tomorrow. I will take Saravanan and go. I have a feeling, Ayya will come and act in my film. I am not making a bad film. If Ayya acts in my film, the remuneration which is given to a hero, I will give it to you. In case Ayya doesn't come, let the advance be with you. I will come tomorrow. Take grandfather's blessings. Ayya has come. " Are you a shard of him?" " Are you a spark of him?" " Are you his shadow?" " Or are you him?!!!" " Are you a shard of him?" " Are you a spark of him?" " Are you his shadow?" " Or are you him?!!!" Lets not postpone Tarun's operation anymore. Let no one else know about this. They will talk without understanding. Okay, sir. " As a spark, as a flame," " within your eyes, I see his light." " As movement, as sound," " your entire body oozes his language!!!" " After fire consuming him," " he isn't finished even by a drop!!!" " After The Earth swallowing him," " deep... deeper... within you, he grows!!!" " Your smile is him!" " Your vision is him!" " Your words are him!" " The life you live is him and only him!" " Your path is him!" " Your path of flowers is him!" " The fragrance of the flowers is also him!" " The breath you take is him and only him!" " As a spark, as a flame," " within your eyes, I see his light." This is Saravanan. He's the new face, being introduced as the hero in my film. " your entire body oozes his language!!!" " After fire consuming him," " he isn't finished even by a drop!!!" " After The Earth swallowing him," " deep... deeper... within you, he grows!!!" No one has ever missbehaved with me like this. I am the wife of the world famous Pandavas. " Are you his shadow?" " Or are you him?!!!" " Are you a shard of him?" " Are you a spark of him?" " Are you his shadow?" " Or are you him?!!!" Sir, a friend of mine wants to narrate a story to Saravanan. First, you listen to it. If you like the story, we can discuss the other details later. Okay, lets listen to it. Hello sir. I heard it. It was nice. Okay, then Maran, shall I talk to sir and let you know? Thanks a lot sir. Please come sir. It's what I have told you before. First let Ayya come and act. The rest can be spoken later. Ayya is acting in Maran's film. Continuously if good stories keep coming, I think Ayya will keep acting in films. No, not this story. The story is nice. " You... are the play!" " A very small play." " The new stage is him!!!" " You are a puppet." " An alive puppet," " and he is the puppeteer!!!" " As a limitless dream," " he lingers in your eyes!" " As never ending music," " he lives in your ears!" " What a pity for death." " He has ruined its purpose." You have received the National award in your debut film itself... I am very happy I got the National award. But I consider the love of my fans, as my biggest award. No, we don't want a bigger amount. First lets listen to the story. If we like that, then we can discuss the rest. " your entire body oozes his language!!!" " After fire consuming him," " he isn't finished even by a drop!!!" Saravanan has come. Come Saravanan. " deep... deeper... within you, he grows!!!" " Your smile is him!" " Your vision is him!" " Your words are him!" " The life you live is him and only him!" " Your path is him!" " Your path of flowers, is him!" " The fragrance of the flowers is also him!" " The breath you take is him and only him!" " Are you a shard of him?" " Are you a spark of him?" " Are you his shadow?" There's a saying, that the father of cinema is theatre. Saravanan is an actor with an experienced theatre background. I have seen Saravanan's earlier film as well, and I have also seen 'Kanni Theevu', for which he's won the award. His acting, is fresh, good and devoid of any imitation. I wish he keeps growing and I pray to the almighty for that, and my best wishes are with him. " Are you a shard of him?" " Are you a spark of him?" " Are you his shadow?" " Or are you him?!!!" " Are you a shard of him?" As of now I am not interested in politics. " Are you his shadow?" " Or are you him?!!!" You ask the producer to call me, I will discuss the other details with him. Okay sir. Who is that Saravanan? The director of the next film. Next film? What film? I am committing to a new film, I heard the story, it's very good. You can't do that. I haven't heard it. Why can't I do it? Why trouble yourself. From now onwards I will make the decisions. Saravanan, Ayya will not act in just any kind of story. What do you mean, Ayya! Ayya! for everything? I am working day and night. People are coming to watch me. Your going on saying, Ayya! Ayya! for everything. For you to give me a small amount from my hard earned money is it? Even I have gratitude. After all I came from your theatre group. From now, I will decide and give you something. You need not do anything. That's what feels right to me. Go! Go! Wait... wait... Give it. - Sir, me too. - Come. Hello! Hello! Hello! Take out the mirror. Have you eaten? - Yes, I have, what about you? - I've eaten. What's the scene? Sir, in today's scene, you will be seated alone on the park bench. After many days, you land up meeting, your teenage love only now. After seeing her, you're shocked. She is also turning and looking at you. After she turns... You continue. She turns and looks and you look at her too. You go through shock, surprise, happiness, love, yearning, and you look at her with all these mixed feelings. Is it not very hot,sir ? Get me juice? I am ready sir. Where is the position, sir? On the bench. Sir, what about the girls? The girls, will be behind the tree. They will only be there. You have to be here. I am ready sir. Sir, your first look is onto your right. As you turn, the girls will be on your left. After you see them only, you give those reactions. Sir, that's for you to fix your look! Shall we roll, sir? Is it okay sir? This looks like you knew and looked. I know her is it not? Yes, you know her, but you won't know she's there. Turn around casually, that's it. Casually? Do you require these flowers? They are very disturbing. Let's avoid the flowers. We can create all this through CG these days, is it not ? Is it okay, sir? Shall we go to the next? I'll just take a look at the playback. I will also come, sir. All that you said, shock, surprise, happiness, love... Yearning. What sir? You became emotional is it? Everything is what you told me, sir. That's just a mood. It's not necessary to do everything literally. I am a director's artiste. I will do whatever the director asks me to do. That's correct . Just one look, with all these emotions mixed. How do you want me to mix it? Now, when you were in school... I am gonna mix it... watch... Is he doing it purposely? Mixed, doesn't mean this, sir. How else should I mix it? Okay, just forget everything I told you till now. Forget and...? You have been in love with a girl during your school days. Yes... You're seeing that girl now after many days. I am seeing... How will you look at a girl you loved? Sir, that's simple, just leave it to me. I'll take care. It's too melodramatic. Not like that sir, whatever you did now, just make it subtle. Subtle? Please tell me everything earlier. Okay sir. All this is running in your mind, and then just one look. Don't show too many facial expressions. Why have you gotten up? I finished doing it. Sir, there was nothing, it was just blank. It was lifeless. Why not... now it will be there. Let your teeth not show so much. If I do it well you're saying it's melodramatic. If I do it subtly you're saying it's blank. How can I laugh, without my teeth showing? What you did only. Don't show so much of your teeth, when so much shows, it doesn't look good. Okay sir. One final take without the teeth showing. You don't even have to turn, just the look, lets try one more. Lets try, sir. Sir, am feeling a little uneasy, shall I have a tea, and come? Okay sir, go and come. What's happened to him? That's what I don't know. Last week how well he performed the interval scene. Why is he messing up so much today? Sir, tea. I don't want. Brother! There was an elderly man inside, did you see him? Who? Parasuraman sir? Hmmm... He left long back. What is it sir? Let's start. It looks like you're thinking and turning. Thinking is it... Sir, this looks like you're turning in fear. Fear is it... Sir, This looks like you're nervous. Nervous is it, sir? Yes! What happened? It's busted. The fuse has gone. Sir, just a minute. What? I am not feeling too well. Shall we do it tomorrow? Sir, you could have told me this earlier. Okay, go. Hey! What are the other shots without him? - Where is the heroine? - She has just landed. Sir. I was wrong. Please forgive me. You listen to the stories and decide. If you say no, it's a no. Please ask Ayya to come and act. You, please leave. Sir. Saravanan. What's the problem? Tell me Saravanan. Any problem with your health? No, sir. Any family problem. Nothing like that sir. Then why are you so nervous? No sir, today we will do it. Today I will act. Are you sure, you can do it? Sure? Your face is filled with fear. Think of me like your brother. Whatever it is tell me. Sir, I confess, all these days I wasn't acting. Ayya, who was within my body, was only acting. Ayya, means? Ayya... sir. Aadhimoolam Ayya, who was in our theatre group. He was only within my body and has been acting. Thyagu sir, called me to act in his film... Parasuraman only sent me. In that film, it was me physically, but it was Ayya, who acted. Yesterday I saw it with my own eyes. Now, suddenly, Ayya is not coming. That's why I am very confused from yesterday. Sir, I am very new to theatre. No matter how many takes you go for, I am not sure whether I will deliver what you want. Sir, there is only one way out. What is it? Ayya has to come. Hey! Is your hero into any drugs? Nothing like that, sir. Tell me Sundar ? Saravanan was performing very well. Now, he's not even able to give a simple expression. When I asked him, he's saying, someone called Ayya from his theatre group, only was inside him and was acting. Now for the past two days Ayya is not coming, and that's why he is unable to perform, he is blabbering some rubbish. Has he disclosed everything? What does that mean? Sundar? You have seen my film... Did he act in that film? If he didn't perform then... He's telling the truth. He didn't perform. Ayya only acted. I have seen Ayya acting through him, and I've seen him acting without Ayya. It's up to you to believe it or not. But this is what happened in my film. Okay, let what you're saying be the truth. Then why can't he just come and act in my film. That's what I am not able to understand. You wouldn't have done anything. Did he do anything wrong? Thyagu, I am really losing it. There is no use you getting tensed, there is just one solution to this. What? What he's saying only, Ayya has to come and act. What is this? This story, seems to be more fictitious than your movie's story. What do I look like to you? That you can just say any rubbish. Why? What you have shot till now, has not come out properly is it? Nothing like that, sir. Till date, I have not liked any of your films. Everything would look very dark. In spite of that, do you know why I signed you? Since, you got his dates. Now, how can you say you don't want him? Why would I lie? Without believing what he said, I called director Thyagu... Don't tell me all these stories. I have borrowed money on interest and am producing the film. So far, ten days of shoot has been completed. I have taken lot of money, banking on the business of this film. Do you know! I don't know what and how you're going to do it. Take time till the festival holidays get over. Train him properly and complete the film. We can't change the hero now. Training him is not as easy as you think. You may leave. You may leave. "News is out," "that, all the films, actor Saravanan featured in," "he did not act, but through him the late legendary theatre actor Aadhimoolam," "has acted." "When enquired about this, Actor Saravanan and his debut director Thyagu," "have confirmed the news. Which has further added," "to the shock and astonishment." "When Ayya's associate, Parasuraman spoke about this..." Acting was Ayya's life. That life hasn't gone anywhere. He was acting till he was alive. He died while he was acting. After his death, he is still acting through someone. Our Ayya, is now taking care of all our lives. "When senior film director Bharathiraja spoke about this, he said..." Look here. All of you may or may not believe this. As far as I am concerned, artistes just don't disappear like that. They will definitely be living through someone. Ayya. Aadhimoolam. I have seen many of his plays. I am a very big fan of his. Once, I had asked him to act in one of my films. He had refused. The reason he gave for that... he said... "As long as I am functioning," "and I am alive," "I wish to act only in front of a live audience." I missed the chance. I have heard a lot about all these films, have not yet seen them. I am eager to watch them. Brother. Greetings sir. Sit down. Sir, I am Ravi of Thaai Productions. I have come to ask for Ayya's dates for my next film. Brilliant story. Story revolves around the girl. We have even found the girl. But the acting... Ayya had acted as a female character in one of his stage plays. If Ayya can act like that, it would be very good. Without knowing the story... We will tell you the whole story, only if Ayya likes it, let him come and act in it. If Ayya comes and acts, what more do we need. Sir, I am Ramesh of Kaalikambal films. I want Ayya to act in my film also. It's a story about a father and son. Ayya would be playing both the father and the son. It's a dual role. Sir, in my film, it's a five year old child's character for Ayya! It is a nice story. " Throughout The Revolving Universe..." " His fame will spread, as he reveals his face..." " Life leaves him, still the Silver Screen witnesses his talent!!!" " Never Before! Never After!" " Unparalleled is his amazing Act!" " The eyes are transfixed! As the art unveils on Screen!" " Within the Projector's beam that streams..." " His art merges to light up the Screen!" " Even tied hands will clap and the sounds surpass the Seas!!!" " Breaking through dams..." " He's a massive flood that flows over!" " As it rushes by, baseless seeds are washed away..." What are you all doing still? quick! No sir, on that date Ayya can't come. He has a play. Please understand. Yes,okay. - Are you ready? - Yes! Like you said, I am experiencing loneliness. From the top of my reign, I look down. All I see is just emptiness! " An endless Fountain!!!" " A changeless Change!!!" " He will reach unreached Depths!!!" " An endless Fountain!!!" No, not this story. " Without living he lives On!!!" "AYYA!!!" " Who can obstruct The Mighty Sun with a hand!" "AYYA!!!" " Who can ever understand the intent of THE CREATOR!" "AYYA!!!" " He will overcome death, destroying darkness, giving light he will Rise!!!" "AYYA!!!" "AYYA!!!" " Who can obstruct The Mighty Sun with a hand!" "AYYA!!!" " Who can ever understand the intent of THE CREATOR!" " AYYA!!!" " He will overcome death, destroying darkness, giving light he will Rise!!!" "AYYA!!!" Sir, we are producing films for the last fifty years. The family priest told us not to produce, for the last seven and a half years. After that, this is the first film I am producing. Ayya should definitely act in it. Isn't that the trend today. Story? It's a nice family subject about a middle aged man. The director will tell you the whole story. Sir, the story happens in Chennai. The story is nice, we can do it. Who is the hero? For Ayya to perform, you just need a body. Let this be that body. Ayya. Aadhimoolam No sir, Ayya is not free on that date. He can't be acting in one film during the day, and another at night. You can do one thing, he is free on the 20th and 21st, will you shoot then? That one ad in the paper is wrong. Ayya has not acted in that film. They have just put it. Please don't get cheated by fakes. " In the sky that house's the stars..." " In the sky that house's the stars..." " He will be the cloud that holds the Lightning!!!" " He will be the cloud that holds the Lightning!!!" " The sounds of the entire sea..." " The sounds of the entire sea..." " He will be The Conch that contains it!!!" " He will be The Conch that contains it!!!" " For all the trees that grow in the forest..." " For all the trees that grow in the forest..." " He is the Seed!!!" " He is the Seed!!!" " For the wind that caresses..." " For the wind that caresses..." " He will be The Flute that transforms it to Music!!!" " In the sky that house's the stars..." " He will be the cloud that holds the Lightning!!!" " The sounds of the entire sea..." " He will be The Conch that contains it!!!" " For all the trees that grow in the forest..." " He is the Seed!!!" " For the wind that caresses..." " He will be The Flute that transforms it to Music!!!" " Splintering Specks THE STATUE HE IS!!!" " He is the Electrifying Storm!!!" " He is the Whiplashing Wave!!!" " He is the Resurrected Permanence!!!" " He is the Fire within the unstruck match!!!" " A lifespan has limits..." " That is imprisoned in our body..." " He shatters these norms!" " Who can obstruct The Mighty Sun with a hand!" "AYYA!!!" " Who can ever understand the intent of THE CREATOR!" " AYYA!!!" " He will overcome death, destroying darkness, giving light he will Rise!!!" " AYYA!!!" " AYYA!!!" " Who can obstruct The Mighty Sun with a hand!" " AYYA!!!" " Who can ever understand the intent of THE CREATOR!" " AYYA!!!" " He will overcome death, destroying darkness, giving light he will Rise!!!" Is this the story they told you? Isn't the shooting going on here? Yes. Inside the factory. "From this moment, you are my God forever!" "In your hands I seek refuge." "A young woman I am!" You rocked sir. You have outdone yourself sir! Don't forget me sir. Sure master. Sure master. Did the romance come out, like the way you wanted? Yes... yes... All the romantic sequences? Superb! Superb is it? It was good. Will meet tomorrow. Will meet tomorrow, sir. Parasuraman, when did you come? A while ago. Sit down. I heard, the film release today had a fantastic opening. Ours is going to beat all this and reach great heights. Hey, can't you serve him some coffee or tea? I don't want. Leave. Which film is this, you're acting in? What are you asking! Our film, only! They are trying to rape the second heroine, I am only trying to save her. She gets emotional, runs towards me and hugs me. From there we cut to a song in Mauritius. We are going there next week. When you narrated the story to me, all these scenes weren't there! We have to do certain things, keeping the gallery audience in mind. That's why these fights and songs. But, don't you have to take, only the story you told me! This was what, I told... While narrating how can we, dance and fight and show you. Make only what you told me. Don't do all this. Listen, for the kind of market value Ayya has today, if there are no songs and fights, tomorrow they will question me, no one will question you. No, everything is going wrong. What? What is going wrong? We are filming the story we told you. We can't just shoot a bland film. We have to add certain elements for the sake of the audience. Not wanting all of that is why, Ayya never acted in films. Today people are watching, without all those elements! Oh! Come on! Look here Parasu... Now how do I, make you understand. Ayya has clicked with the upmarket audience. Only now, he is slowly going down to the gallery audience. Shouldn't we further take him down. Is it enough for him to be in Tamil alone? Don't you want him to act in other languages? Wait and watch, he's going to be a national star. No... no need all this. What is this? Why are you going on saying the same thing? The growth of such talented people, is always stopped by people with him, like you. You don't unnecessarily interfere in this. Mind your own business. I've already paid for Ayya to come and act in this film. Ayya is coming and acting. Now it's between me and Ayya. What's your problem? Sir, tomorrow the shooting is at the hero's house. What time? Morning 7am sir. Okay. I will be there. I'll call you. Sir, now... You're ready to go to office, you're walking down the stairs. You're looking everywhere for your wife. She's in the kitchen. You call out to her affectionately, "Ma...", We cut to, her saying, "what dear?", and running towards you. After that... No sir, first, lets film till this point . Ma... Ma... Take ma... Ma... Sir, it sounded very rude. It has to be affectionate. Wasn't it affectionate? No, sir. Let it sound very affectionate sir. Amma... Sir, that sounds like you're calling your mother, not your wife. Is that so? Yes, sir. Just explain that scene once more. Sir, you're madly in love with your wife. In fact, yesterday, you and your wife, have had a nice, romantic moment. In that same mood, you come down and, call her "Ma"... Oh! The previous scene was that? You never told me that. Go. Ma... Sir, this is sounding different... What do you mean different... You only said it has to be romantic. Sir, this is... kind of... like that... Please sir, let's do one more. Ma... Sir, there are no emotions in this. Emotions aren't coming, correct? Correct sir. You think I didn't know that. Emotions won't come. Hey! Kumar! Come here. - What are Ayya's call sheet timings? - Sir, from 9am to 6pm. If it's a 9am call sheet, and you keep the shot at 7am, how wil he come? Call for a break, sir. Serve, ma'am. No, I don't want. Please eat. It's made out of Ghee. You won't put on weight. Just a little... a little... Enough... enough... Serve cashew. Keep some for me. Now explain clearly. That's what sir, you will come down, and affectionately... Hey! Why you telling me. Tell him, clearly. To him... That's what... you come down... you look around... You, call your wife 'Ma'... affectionately, sir. She too will come running, and say lovingly, 'what dear?'. That's all. He would have understood. Go. Ma... Sir, any problem? I over ate a bit. Now you're okay sir? Shall we do it once more? Lets go. Ma... Sir, you went out from the frame. I went out, is it? Sir, that's the position. All this while, I was doing it right. Yes sir, now you went out . Hey! Mark it. I think I got too carried away. Let's do it once more. One more. Ma... Sir, you looked at the mark. Without looking at the mark, how can I stand on the mark? Sir, the mark will be there, but you shouldn't look at it sir. What!!! The mark will be there, I shouldn't see it, but I have to stand on it!!! Yes, sir. Ma... I looked at the mark is it? I am coming sir. Sir, You looked at the mark, at me and everyone else. Is it?! Yes, sir. Show me. Come, sir. Playback. Ma... Okay, come. Why can't you go little away? No sir, this will look good only as a close up. Ma... Super sir. Lets immediately go for a take. What was this!!! This was just a rehearsal. The camera wasn't rolling. You weren't rolling? What nonsense!!! What were you doing behind the camera,without rolling!!! I wasn't asked to roll, sir. Sir, no problem, we can roll it now sir. Lets do it, sir. Roll camera. Ma... Sir, this sounds like something else. I know. When it came out well, this guy did not roll. Lets go once more. Sir, You have become very dull. Let this shot be energetic. Energetic? Yes sir. Okay, okay. Hey! Wait! Don't I have to get ready? How can I do it immediately. Amma... Again you have come out from the mark, sir. Sir, stand in the "Ma" position. Sir, and one more thing, this sounds very childish. Let it be more matured. Matured is it? Hey! Wait! Sir, just take a look at the mark properly. Amma... Sir, this was too much. Bro! Again he went out of the frame. Shoot something else today. We will do this later. What happened bro? Did he fall down? That's what I think. I am not sure. Sir, you called for me? Tomorrow lets take no one else, only you and the cameraman come. I will come. Shoot something with me and see. Why sir? Nothing. Lets meet tomorrow. Go. Greetings! Parasuraman. Are you stepping out? Thank god... Ayya!!! Shall I pray and come? Nothing much Parasuraman, I was passing by, so I thought of seeing you. Sit down. Yesterday, after you left, I sat and thought for a long while. What you said was correct. All these businessmen confused me. That's why I was a little lost. Ayya has carved a particular path, to do the regular thing, why is Ayya required! Ayya's path is unique. That's the reason for which Ayya has come. People like everything. Just because people like Arrack, can we make it? We can only do, what is correct. Let's not use the fights we shot. I've also asked them to cancel the song shoot. Yesterday, after the way I spoke to you, I felt really bad. That's why I came to say sorry. Due to the tension at shoot, I just spoke something. Please don't take it to heart. I couldn't sleep whole of last night. Today, Ayya's dates are with us isn't it? Yes. No. He never came. Have you given dates to any other film? You said there was some patchwork. No, today it is your film. Is it? Generally, if he gives his word, he will come, is it not? Till date, he has never disappeared on the dates you promised, isn't it? No, he will come. Just once... Yes, I was told. He didn't come during Saravanan's shooting. Similarly, has Ayya misunderstood now? I don't know? I did it by mistake. I am human too. Isn't it natural to make mistakes? I did it by mistake. And I realized that. I have apologized to you as well. Keeping that in mind... Why aren't you saying anything? What can I say? If I have made any mistake, please forgive me. I will make the film, exactly like how I told him. Please don't test me. I won't be able to bear it. I don't believe in God, I believe in Ayya. He's like my God. He will definitely come. I have faith. Please take care. " A cock is spreading it's feathers like a peacock." " Trying to win over the universe." " By doing the dance." " Do stand and watch!" " The Ant hill imagines itself," " to be a temple tower." " And unveils the drama." " Please do listen!" " The kite with a broken thread," " is trying hard to reach the skies." " This disgusting, disgraceful act..." " Should be spoken about!" " The time belongs to me," " says, the egoistic man." " Though his fate is doomed," " he's brash!" " Even with the greasepaint on." " A gooseberry," " can't turn into an apple!" " A needle can't transform," " into a sword!" What should I do now? Just walk straight into the sea, sir. " A cock is spreading it's feathers like a peacock." " Trying to win over the universe." " By doing the dance." " Do stand and watch!" " The Ant hill imagines itself," " to be a temple tower." " And unveils the drama." " Please do listen!" " The kite with a broken thread," " is trying hard to reach the skies." " This disgusting, disgraceful act," " should be spoken about!" " The time belongs to me," " says, the egoistic man." " Though his fate is doomed," " he's brash!" Sir, on action, turn around looking very angry. " The Helicopter flower," " shouldn't imagine," " itself to be a Rose!" " Without the rope," " no grand swing," " can move!" Sir, everything is wrong. Over... Everything's over. Why sir? That man, Ayya, is not coming for the past two days. Oh! What do we do now, sir? What to do... Lets put the faith in God. I'll do it myself. " When a lowlife snuff," " blames the ceramic." " The world will never agree." " A chemical less mirror," " cannot reflect, our face!" " Once the water has, all dried up." " The fish will never, want to swim!" " Once flies have settled, on rotten food." " You shouldn't sell it." " No one makes it on their own..." " Don't grow horns..." " From your roots," " never ever distance yourself!" Sir, let's not do anything else, just simply stand and keep looking, that's enough. " A cock is spreading it's feathers like a peacock." " Trying to win over the universe." " By doing the dance." " Do stand and watch!" " The Ant hill imagines itself," " to be a temple tower." " And unveils the drama." " Please do listen!" " The kite with a broken thread," " is trying hard to reach the skies." " This disgusting, disgraceful act," " should be spoken about!" " The time belongs to me," " says, the egoistic man." " Though his fate is doomed," " he's brash!" Just sit here, and look at the sea. That's enough. Sir, move a little forward and sit. Enough sir, there's a serious problem. Somehow try to make him come. Hey! Give me my phone. Look here, Parasuraman... This is wrong. Then this problem will take a different route. You will have to face it. What do you think of yourself . Look here, sir, I have spoken to you about this before. All of you say one thing, and then do one thing. You did not film the story you told. Why you going on saying that... Now, What's the solution to this? We will return your money, sir. What? Returning the money...? Will everything be fine, if the money is returned? Do you know how much money I've spent so far on this film? More than half the film is done. If he doesn't come now, how will I complete the film? I don't care about anything. After diwali I am fixing a schedule. He has to come and act. If he doesn't come, just watch, what I do to all of you! Playing the fool with me! After he died, where did he first act? In the auditorium, is it not? Yes, sir. One of you go sit there. No, you itself go. If anyone acts very well over there, or you hear them, talking about something like that, immediately call me. Sure sir. I want to question that person, right, left and centre! When have you scheduled Ayya's patchwork? Today we are shooting the patchwork. How is he acting? He hasn't come to act at all! That's why I had called Parasuraman, to find out. He says he doesn't know! Hasn't he come there also? Then what are you doing? What to do... We had to finish yesterday itself. It's just patchwork. So we are somehow managing. Is it? Okay, I will call later. Tell me, sir. When is your photo shoot? Tomorrow, sir. Tomorrow... Where is it happening? At the Set Fire Studio in Nungambakkam. Oh! You have kept it there? Why sir? Nothing... nothing... go ahead and do it. Is it a big set ? Yes sir. Have you spent a lot? Yes...Yes... sir. Go ahead... go ahead... That boy has applied his makeup and is waiting for two hours. The heroine is getting annoyed. When will Ayya, come? I don't know. What? You don't know? The best thing to do is, you become an actor. Don't remain a producer. You can be in peace. They will come and give you snacks and you can eat. All the politicians are acting. All the actors are becoming politicians. Excuse me. What's the solution to this problem? This Ayya, has not been coming to the shoot for many days. Hoping he will come, how long can I keep going to shoot? I have tried everything... Suddenly he is doing this. Not just in my film. He hasn't turned up in either of their films as well. Hey! Did you come to eat these snacks? Okay, this is just patchwork. He shelved it, as they had begun. Just like this, another film also has been shelved. All this is fine, sir. Mine, is more than half way through. Suddenly if he doesn't come, what can I do? Hey! how can you consider this as an issue, and bring it to the council? Why shouldn't I bring it? Then how can I complete my film? One man is dead, apparently his soul is acting, and with that soul all of you will keep on making films, and all those films will become big hits! And now that soul has run away, while acting in a film! Hey! To complete a film with a living actor, itself, we get completely exhausted. Now where to go look for a soul, which has run away! Why, didn't you believe it? Did you not narrate a story and ask for his dates? My good fortune, that man did not like my story. I escaped, you got caught! He liked only your story. To add to that, you found it apt for you and acted as the hero! I wonder who cast their evil eyes! Look here Dhanapal... That man, when alive itself was very stubborn. During my father's days when we asked him, he refused to come and act. I don't think it's possible to call that soul, and complete your film. What can we do with a dead man! No one in the council knows any such magic. Please try and understand. Dhanapal... You have so many years of experience in cinema. Won't you complete this film! Being confident that Ayya will perform, I had borrowed a lot of money. Since I am acting as a hero for the first time, I spent a lot on the film. If anything goes wrong, the loan sharks will be at my neck!!! Even if the King's rule doesn't exist, the desire to be a King still exists! Even now you can see, they present a grand sword, and they crown him! Such thoughts ruin a man's duty! He too... Is this a deserted land? Who will come to listen to my commands? Amidst the thick bamboo bushes, I can hear the breathing of the snake. It's scorching hot! I am dying of a parched throat. I am not scared of anything that chases me! I don't have any life left to lose! Brother! I made a mistake! He would have at least stayed on in this auditorium. Did I... Value money more! No... no... nothing like that. Hello, sir. Hey! What happenend? Sir, everyone's acting very well. It's superb! We can use any of them in our films in the future, sir. Suggestion is it? Idiot! Did Ayya come there or not? Sir, I don't know that. Even Parasuraman sir, is seated here, looking sad. Won't he have been happy if Ayya had come? Okay. When everything shook in fear, I too stood shivering! I slept, as the foxes were howling! I walked the same path as the snake's crawl! "For the past few days, actor Ayya. Aadimoolam," "has not attended any of his film shootings." "Therefore the film units have given a complaint to the Producers council." "All the films, that he had agreed to do," "have been stalled." "This comes as a rude shock to all Ayya's fans." Greetings sir! I am Thyagu speaking! All what I heard, is it true? Is Ayya coming on stage? Okay sir, I will come and see you. "Ayya Aadhimoolam's soul has disappeared." "The late Ayya. Aadhimoolam, passes away again." "Ayya. Aadhimoolam's soul has suddenly disappeared." "Ayya. Aadhimoolam's soul disappeared." "Once again the death of Ayya. Aadhimoolam." How are you so sure that Ayya's soul has disappeared? For the past two to three months, Ayya has not come in any of the films. Not just in films, he has not come in any of the plays we have staged. We are slowly losing hope. It's frightening. To think that, Ayya, has left us and gone forever. What is the reason for his disappearance, forever? Please. Lets not talk about all that now. Regarding the demise of Ayya, lets see what the fans have to say. Look here, he is a man who came to act even after his death, he hasn't gone anywhere, he is around here, somewhere. We won't believe anyone. There is a reason why a dead man came back to act. Likewise there should be a reason for why he disappeared. Imagine if this is the situation for a soul. What could be our situation? If he has really disappeared, then those responsible for that, will have to face the consequences. If it's true that he as left, like everyone's saying, there is definitely a reason. We have to find out that. For the past few years, Ayya's soul which has been acting in films, has suddenly disappeared. How... and... Why? Sir, what's your opinion on this? I was really astonished, when I heard that, the legendary, theatre artiste Aadhimoolam Ayya, was acting even after his demise. I have seen all his films. I have liked all those films. Apart from the fact that he has disappeared or not disappeared, this is his wish, sir. He wished to act, and that was continued by his soul. If he's not acting now, doesn't it mean, he wishes not to? I wasn't surprised, that Ayya had come to act in cinema. How they allowed him survive in cinema for the past 4 years, that's what surprised and shocked me. What has happened today, I expected this to happen, long back. My worry is that, it has happened, just the way I expected it. So, do you think the reason for Ayya's disappearance, is the system of the film industry? Nothing to think about Manoj, that is the truth. That's more or less how the system has been for a long time. Each person before entering this industry, comes with big dreams of becoming like, Akira Kurosawa... Satyajit Ray. They come with immense passion for the art. After they come here, to safeguard their own art, itself is a huge struggle. To be very frank, the man who says that cinema is an art form, will be the biggest idiot today! The word art has literally become a taboo, long ago! But sir, isn't cinema not just an art but also a business? Sir, not just cinema, today there is no field without the business aspect . That to cinema is a popular art form. It's one where people come to theatres, pay for it and celebrate it. It's a humongous art form!!! Just because they come to theatres and buy tickets, why are we assuming that people's, artistic standards are low? Why should we degrade their artistic intelligence? Just take Ayya for example. His soul came to act. He was acting for, four years. You think he came to act without, the need for money? Definitely he would have needed money. Just because he needed money, they did not make any inferior movies. The movies were good and they made money. The problem is, the fact that, good intentions, good art, and good films, will be accepted by the people, is not accepted by the system. To be frank sir, over here, they are literally killing art and the feelings of an artiste. The killing of people alone is not murder, even the killing of one's feelings is also murder. One good thing that has happened, is that, such murders have been continuously happening. Now because of the disappearance of Ayya's soul, it has come out in the open now. So is this a murder? If its a murder, then how did it happen? Who's the reason for it? Who is that? Sir, it's me Kumar. What is it? Sir, it's an important issue, open the door. I am having bath. You go, I will come. Sir, it's very urgent. Hey! Because of that can I just walk out like this? Go, I'll come. At least switch on the TV and watch, sir. All the news channels are carrying news on you. About me? "News has just come in, that," "a person named Mahesh," "has accused, well known film producer and debutant actor," "Dhanapal, as the man who has killed Ayya's soul." "He has filed a case against him, in the court today!" "The fact that Ayya, last appeared," "in the film 'Don't Leave Me'," "was produced by Dhanapal, is to be noted." Hey!!! Sir... sir... am slipping... Get up. What nonsense is this? When did I kill him? That man was already dead. No sir, he was dead, but his soul was alive. They are saying, you have killed that. Go down and wait in my office. Hello! Dhanapal sir. How are you? I thought of calling you myself. I just heard the news. Then, how can I be fine. Sir... What now? Sir, all the people from the media, are waiting outside, to meet you. What? Media? Yes, sir. Sir, the people from the media are here. What should I do now? Is it? You go and meet the media sir. I am coming there now, we can discuss everything else. Okay, sir. Sir, if you don't go and address the media, it will be proven you're the murderer. Hey! Sir, you're innocent, why should you get scared! Hey! This case won't be accepted by the court. Sir, our conscience is clear, why should we be scared? Lets just meet them. Sir, not just that, this is free publicity for you. All of you just wait there. Just Wait there. I have no answers for any questions. All of you know that this is a stupid case. Firstly this case will not be registered in court. If it gets registered, then you come and question me. I will answer. Please don't blow this out of proportion anymore. "As the news pours in, that the reason for," "the demise of Ayya Aadhimoolam's soul is," "well known producer and actor Dhanapal." "It has caused a major uproar amidst Ayya's fans." "The court must accept this case." "All these days we were believing this." "What's the answer to our belief?" "It is alright if the court doesn't accept this case," "we will deal with it, in our own way!" "The court has to punish the man responsible for Ayya's death." "If it doesn't punish, we will punish him." "There will be major riots..." "If the court doesn't hear this case." "It will become a huge issue." "What do they think..." "That man has to own up..." "If he doesn't, we will break into his house and beat him up." What is happening in this city? "What nonsense is this?" "He has done the damage and is happily sitting..." "Watching that we should keep quiet is it!" Hello! What is it? There is a lot of crowd at the door step. Come down soon. Even the police have come. "Understand one thing..." "We won't leave this..." "We need a solution..." Come out Dhanapal. Sir, the problem is becoming bigger... In this situation, you can't go out anywhere. It's not safe for you anymore. They are all boiling with rage. They will damage your property. This will keep getting worse, day by day. The media is fully supporting them. They will make use of this situation, and the media will keep blowing it up. Lets deal with this case differently. Lets go to court, and file a defamation suit. Lets plead for your safety, and ask for police protection. If this case gets heard in court, definitely the judgment, will be in favour of us. Okay. Sir, Dhanapal has said Ayya's fans are threatening him, and has asked for police protection. Not just that, he has accused us of spreading false news about him, and so he has filed a defamation suit in court against us. For the first time in history, The court will be hearing a case for a soul. The trial will be heard in a while... I told you all that day itself... All of you already know the answer. How can I kill a dead person? They are cheating people, with this soul nonsense! There used to be so many actors then... There used to be so many artistes then... Aren't they true artistes? Where have all those souls gone? That's okay sir. Apparently you narrated one story, in the beginning, and later on filmed something different, and wrong, is it ? Look here, my family is a very respected family. From my father's time, we are producing films for the past fifty years. "The family lamp," "Promise on the holy thread," "Our Sister", we have made many such good films and have won awards as well!!! You shouldn't be talking badly about us!!! Sir... sir... don't get angry. I am not getting angry. I am just clarifying. Anyway, in sometime, the truth will be out. Let me go inside and talk. Just one more thing, if there is any danger to my life, the late Aadhimoolam and his family are responsible. This miserable condition I am going through, no one should ever have to go through. Make way... make way... Okay sir. Lets see. Sit down. That guy... who is that guy wearing glasses? Sir, he's the guy, who filed the case against you. I have seen him somewhere. He's come to our office many times, to narrate stories, sir. You gave him lot of opinions and sent him away. Is the witness ready? Dhanapal. Sir, everyone's trying to kill me. All the people of Tamil Nadu are supporting them. This is similar to the story, of how Lord Ganesha, drank the milk. No one will believe me now, sir. My time is not good now, sir. My stars are in bad alignment now. I should have never made this film now. In spite of that I made it, so I deserve this. There never used to be anyone around my house. It's a very private space. But now, there are always groups standing there, shouting slogans. It's really frightening to come out. There are women at home. In a situation like this, what can we do sir? No one is trying to kill him. A dead person's soul, which was alive, is no more now. He is the reason for that. That's why people are showing their anger on him. For the past three years they have loved, and been amazed by a person's performance. After the shoot of this man's film... That was the 22nd of October, has not been seen anywhere. And he is the main reason for it. Sir, firstly, he passed away long ago. It's four years since he passed away. Sir, after someone's death, to say the soul is acting, is all rubbish... Hey... Please don't use unnecessary words. Please forgive me, sir. Let him be a great man sir. I've heard about him from my father's times, I've not seen any of his plays, sir. Saying that a dead man is acting in all the films, leave alone yourself, no one will believe it. There is no proof for it. By claiming there is a soul, this group has earned a lot. Someone should have filed a case on them long back. After a point, how long can they, keep saying this, and continue living? This fraudulent gang, now wants to just swindle my money. Just you wait and see, after all this, again one day, they will say Ayya has come back. Where was he sir? When did he act sir? Now, where has he gone sir? Sir? Don't you know, they are lying? So, he did not act in your film? He did not act. In my film, only I acted. Then, what about the payment you gave him? Huh? Ask them? If there are any cheque transactions? So the entire payment was in cash, is it? I've not given them any money. If I have given, ask them to show the proof. They have definitely given money. They have destroyed all the vouchers signed by them. Then why have you advertised, that Ayya is acting in your film? What is this? Give that here... Sir, you itself take a look at it. Just look at the 4 or 5 five posters, everything states that, Ayya is acting! They sometimes announce, it's a true story, but are all those true stories? It's just a trend... Likewise, stating that Ayya's acting is a trend. That's why we put it. Not just me sir, because people like it, everyone was putting it. Who has got the copyrights for this, sir? Who has got the patent, sir? I don't know about the others. But, I haven't given them any money. So, Ayya's soul hasn't acted in your film? I don't believe that a soul can act. But, they are saying that Ayya acted through you, in your film! Definitely not! There is no soul... no ghost... nothing inside me! Firstly, nothing can possess me. Because, I am wearing the holy thread, from my family temple. In this pen drive, there is a scene from the film, which he has acted. You take a look at that. If he performs that scene now, Ayya did not act in his film, it is him only who acted. Sir... sir... you don't look at that. Tell them to give it to me. In the return statement, they have not mentioned this as an exhibit. They cannot mark this today. The shooting of my film is not yet over. Only half the film is over. How is my film's footage available here? They have stolen it. I wonder, what more atrocities are going to happen? I am going to file a case right now. These people have stolen my film. What is this? How is the footage of his unreleased film, in your hands? Okay, but why presenting it now? Let him file a case on us. Our intention is just one thing, you, please give permission. Yes, that footage has come from his film unit. We agree that it has come to us illegally. We are ready to face the consequences. We did that knowingly! All we want to know, is just one thing. He advertised saying, that Ayya is acting through him. Now he's claiming he himself acted. Just take a look at the scene he has acted. Let him perform the same scene here. If he does perform it, it will be proved that Ayya's soul did not act. And that he himself acted. Then we will accept both the defamation suit, and the case for illegally procuring the footage. Then like he said, Ayya's soul was never there. People have been fooled, and they have been frauds, will be proved. Hey! I am saying, stealing the footage itself is wrong! Give me that pen drive! Why you screaming? This is the court, and I am present. The pendrive will reach you. It will not go out anywhere. You're worried that the footage is out, before the release. The appropriate course of action, will be taken. They are advertising, that Ayya's soul is acting through others. People are also coming and watching. Ayya has not acted that's a lie, is what you're saying. If that's proved, The case is closed. If you just act that scene out, everything will be answered. Just fit the pendrive on to my lap top, and give it to me. Sir, what is this? They have stolen my film. I am telling you, action will be taken for that. Sir, you're The Honourable one. You're a Judge! You're the God who delivers justice! You're like God! How can you give such a judgement? I have not yet announced the judgement. If you have only acted, what is your problem to act it out now? Ramya! Ramya! You also take a look at this scene. Take your time. "They have requested Dhanapal, to enact a scene which," "he has already done before." "Dhanapal, is going to act in a while." "If Dhanapal performs just like before," "there is no such thing as Ayya's soul." "It will be proved that it was Dhanapal who acted." "Other actors also acted by themselves." "All this while, it is us the people, who have been cheated." "If Dhanapal is not able to act." "Then the fact, that Ayya's soul acted, will be proved." "If that's the case, why is Ayya's soul not coming now?" "Who and what are the reasons for the demise?" "All these questions, shall be answered. In a short while." Sir, for fifty years, from your dad's period, you have been in films. Luckily you weren't given any other scene. They have made it easy for us, by giving us a scene with no dialogues. This is a cake walk, just go nail it sir. Sir, you used to keep saying, that in school, you acted in a play, as the King Veerapandiya Kattabomman, and the whole school was shocked. Sir, you have performed like the great actor Sivaji Ganesan, won't you be able to act like Ayya! You are going to act. And the whole world is going to be shocked! We are going to win this case, sir. We are winning, sir! Hey! give me water. Call Dhanapal. Are you ready? Honorable Judge, is this fair? Do you think this is right? Has this kind of injustice, happened anywhere? They are saying I killed a dead man. Screening my unreleased film, to me itself, and asking me to enact it! What is this, sir? Why are you repeating the same old thing? This court exists for you to prove your side of the truth. We have given you a chance to prove. Prove it. Now are you going to act, or are you going to disobey the court's order? If you disobey the court's order, the case can turn against you. Don't need to do the entire thing. What you have performed in the last portion of that scene, just do that alone. Act!!! It's getting late. We have given you enough time. Don't waste the court's time. Why sir, you messing it up? I will beat you rascal!!! You are screening my film and asking me itself to act. I will start contempt of court proceedings against you. Behave yourself in court. Have you not told your client, how to behave in court? You have just ten seconds now. Why sir? Hey! I will see to that you don't exist in cinema!!! Just see what I do to all of you!!! I won't act! Even if I die, I won't act! Even if my life is over I won't act! You can do what you want. He has accused me for killing... You can even give me a death sentence. But I will never act!!! Are you playing the fool!!! You want me to act is it... Why should I act? Your time is over. I will go to the supreme court. As Dhanapal wasn't able to prove his innocence, the defamation suit he has filed, against Parasuraman and Ayya Aadhimoolam's family, has been dismissed. Moreover, no one should spread, such baseless, and meaningless rumours. No media should carry any news, associating Dhanapal's name with this. It's a court order. Moreover, while the court was on trial, Dhanapal disrespected the court. Therefore I order the Police Department, to take necessary action. I think, no court would have come across such a case. Whether a soul exists or doesn't, cannot be proved in any court. This is similar to the belief in God. But, someone who knows how to act well, is unable to act today! There is no answer for this as well. We can never approach everything logically. Especially, art is beyond logic. Even before civilization came into being, there was art in humans. Art is one amongst the basic things, that can't be separated from us. Maybe because some miracles exist with us, we don't realize the value of them. I don't know whether such miracles happen. And if such miracles happen, I don't know whether we will allow it to sustain. To Ayya's fans, I just have one thing to say. Lets not have all these, confusions and problems. There is no end for artistes and art. As long as this universe exists, it will exist! Ayya. Aadhimoolam Born : 01. 05. 1939 Died : 22. 10. 2017 "Government Higher Secondary School. Kaduvanur."
