Kim, the Gaspé International Photo Festival is presenting segments from the documentary GABOR, which is currently being made... Yes, it features Gabor Szilasi, a Canadian photographer originally from Hungary who contributed to developing Quebecois photography with his many portraits of the province's residents. He's also important to the Gaspé Photography Festival, as he was awarded the festival's first artist residency. We're on the line with the two people involved: Joannie Lafrenière and Gabor Szilasi, hello! -Hello. -Hello. Ms. Lafrenière, first of all, tell me about how you met the photographer Gabor Szilasi. Well, I was familiar with his work, of course, and then I had the great luck to meet him in 2015 at the festival. I thought: "Wow, he's even more wonderful than I thought." Mr. Szilasi, tell us about your first encounter with Joannie Lafrenière. It was in 2015, here at the Gaspé Photography Festival. Joannie was giving a presentation. We started to talk. Back in Montreal, she called and asked me if I'd be interested in making a film about my life and my work. I thought she seemed really nice, she had a great sense of humour, which I have as well. I thought about it for a day, then I said, "Sure, let's do it." Before heading off on an adventure that will take us from Montreal to Budapest while passing through many rural lands, there's something you should know: it was through photography that Gabor and I connected, years ago. The first time I saw his photos, it all became clear to me: I was going to be a photographer, just like Gabor. His images contained everything that I liked about photography. In every one of Gabor's shots, all his goodness, his humanity, his poetry and his humour shone through. It was then, with my mind full of Gabor's photos, that I realized I'd found it. The thing I wanted to do when I grew up. Seasons went by and, like Gabor, inspiring projects brought me on the road to meet people carrying inside me the precious legacy of his work. Inspired by a desire to get to know the man behind the camera, I gathered up my courage and I asked Gabor if he would be willing to become a tour guide of his own life. And that's how this great adventure began. Should it be horizontal or vertical? Yeah? I don't think I can give you lessons! For me photography was always a great way to approach people. To ask questions. Sometimes indiscreet ones. But I've heard there are no indiscreet questions, only indiscreet answers! The camera was an excuse. Because I really like people. I love people, actually. And I think that comes through in some of the photos. I was really interested in ordinary people, people who had something to say in their expression, their way of life, their attire. That's what I was mainly interested in. I was raised in a big city, in Budapest. I didn't really know any farmers or country folk. It was here in Quebec, at the Quebec Film Board where I worked for 12 years that they sent me out to the country to report for the Minister of Agriculture or of Transport or in the schools. That's where I discovered the farmers, the rural folk. And for me, it was something new. I really liked these people. When I started photographing in Montreal, but also in rural areas, I worked with what's called a large format camera, a 4x5. I would set up the photo and people would come out. Or they would stop me in the street to ask questions. "Will this house be demolished or something?" I said, "No, I like this house and I want to take pictures of it." And people would be really proud that a real photographer, a professional one, had come to their village. -Thanks! -Thank you. See you, Sylvain. -Hello? -Yes, hello sir. -A poutine, please. -What size? Small, medium? Small. -To eat here? -Yes. One small to eat here. How long have you been here? -It's been 26 years. -26 years? Yup. Looks great. -Here you are, bon appétit. -Thanks, super. I have all the photos that I took here in Charlevoix. Look, Jean-Marc. I'll call back. I went up to the same spot and you can't see the graveyard because the trees have grown. Yes, yes. So you can't see any of this. This little house, is it still there? Yes, it's still there. It's the old parish hall. -Oh yeah? -It's still there. A man bought it and he lives there now. He's not from around here. -But the trees are in the way now. -Yes, it has changed. You said this was in 1970? -Yes. -That is our house there. -Oh yes? That's Pascal from the bakery. This is the Laurentides Hotel, but I think it's gone now. -No, it's gone. -The building is still there? It's still there, but now it's the Saint-Gilles paper-making shop. But wasn't Saint-Gilles paper here before? Yeah, but they moved there or right nearby, I think. This is in front of the church after Vespers. That's when I took this photo of Marie Pedneault and Laura Harvey. Hey, that's my godfather, Adrien Bolduc! Yes. So you knew him. He was my uncle. Married to my mom's sister. -That was at the stock-car races. -Oh yes! That's all gone now. Luc Simard, Édouard Guay and Joseph Lajoie. Luc Simard, that's Léonard's brother. Marie-Noëlle's husband, the vet, that's his brother. Those are nice souvenirs. Great photos. -You're Gabor...? -Szilasi. When you came here, you were 30 years old? No I was... Wait a sec. When I came, I would have been 35 years old, maybe even 40. I worked at the Quebec Film Board. But where do you come from originally? From Budapest, in Hungary. I'm Hungarian by birth. -When did you come to Canada? -I was 29. You were 29, so you were finished your studies? Well, no. I had started studying medicine. It's a long story. I wanted to get out in 1949, but the communists caught us at the border. So I couldn't go back to school. I worked in construction, building the Budapest metro. And then I started taking photos and taking French classes at Alliance Française. But in French and in every other language I speak, I have an accent. It's good. We understand you very well. Can I take your photo? We'll say yes, but I don't make very nice photos! If they aren't beautiful, it's the photographer's fault. -You'll get a nice shot. -Yes. My face is highly sought after. It's one of a kind! I'll take another one. Thanks. Super, thanks! -Here? -Here. Alright, let's get arranged. Big smiles! Perfect. Thanks. Nice photo. Let me put it in a bag for you. -A souvenir from Isle-aux-Coudres. -Thank you! -It was so nice to meet you. -For me as well! I'd heard of you before, but we'd never met. It's Bagor? -Your first name? -Gabor. It's Gabriel in French. For us, the word "gabord" means part of a ship. The part at the front is called a "gabord". Oh yeah? -G-A-B-O-R. -Yeah, it's not spelled the same. -Before, Gabor! -Yeah, before Gabor. Before there was Gabor. Let me get you a bag. -He wants to give you that gift. -Great, I'm happy! Come closer. Should we sit? Did you start the self-timer? No. -I'll take this off. -It's nice like that. I brought out all the photos you took in 2010. That's great. I'll never forget how one lady, when she saw herself in the shot, she said, "I'm going to pee my pants!" She said, "I never thought I'd be in a museum." As though it was a museum! But she had quite a reaction. -I'll never forget that. -Yeah. This guy is dead now? Yes, that's what I was saying. -This is mom. -Yes, your mother. This woman is dead now but the man is still around. Renée is still around, and still our president. These people, are they dead? He died last week. We buried him on Monday. Monday or Tuesday of last week. This is my aunt, my dad's sister. She's moved into an old folks home. And this is Renée, you and... Amazing memory! She was the mayor at the time, Jovette. -Post office? -Yes, bravo! -And it's still the post office? -Yes, still. I think she knew that she had nice legs. Oh yes! -And this was at the factory. -That's right. All these photos are like a piece of our history. I can say, "These people are gone, these ones came back." And they're completely in their own world. These photos have a lot to say. -Have the prices changed? -Probably! Hot chicken sandwich, BBQ thigh, yes, fajitas. Oh, fajitas! -These are the Bernatchez. -Yes, the whole family. This barn was blown down one windy day. But it was a very old barn. -And they're still not married? -Still. Nothing has changed. My husband. -The boys. -That's right. I was so warmly accepted thanks to you. The people were very welcoming. No one refused to have their portrait taken. It was a pleasure for us, people still talk about it. -Hello sir. -Hello ma'am. My name is Gabor Szilasi and I have a reservation. Can you sign this, please? Percé Rock is made of limestone, a sedimentary rock deposited at the bottom of a warm, shallow sea around 400 million years ago. That's why it contains so many fossils, bearing witness to the abundance of life at the time. The rock is being eroded by waves and storms. Its cliffs are very unstable due to the wind, rain, freezing and thawing and the salt, which makes them very dangerous to climb. You're from this island? No, from Chandler. Do you have a big family? Children and grandchildren? I had two daughters and a son. Now I just have one son and one daughter. And I have four grandchildren. Oh yeah? And they live in the area? My son lives in Gaspé and my daughter in New Brunswick. My daughter has two girls and my son has two boys. So I have four reasons to be happy. I've been on the sea since I was seven. So I decided to get certified to become a captain. It was a good decision. I'm composing a piece about the Saint Lawrence River for symphony orchestra. It's called Moliantegok. It means "great river". This is beautiful! Superb. That's beautiful. And you stop the vibration with the pedal? Like a piano. I have an autograph collection that I bought after the war from a music collector and a music lover. I have Dohnányi, Kodály, Bartók... I have Richard Strauss, Puccini. All the musicians who had come to Budapest in the 20s and 30s. That's amazing. And singers, too. I heard an anecdote about Richard Strauss. He was in his house during World War Two and a soldier showed up, he was "cleaning things up", and Richard Strauss was very old, but the woman who took care of him said, "Don't kill him, he's Richard Strauss!" And the end of the story was: "Thank God that the soldier knew his music!" -Nice, eh? -Yes, that's nice. -This is Bach arranged by Reger. -Oh yes. So beautiful. But you have to sit and listen. You sit here, and look outside. They play it well, eh? -The great Johann Sebastian Bach. -Yes. I call him the father of all musicians. We should go out on the balcony if you want to get good shots. Yes, okay. I met Doreen, my wife, in 1959. I came from Quebec City, where I'd lived for two or three years, and Doreen was coming from Mexico, from San Miguel de Allende, where she was studying painting. I got her phone number. So I called Doreen and it worked. Growing up, my picture was taken all the time. There was no difference between taking a photo or having a family photo session. He was never without his camera. And I grew up with art everywhere. I'd have my macramé project on the table. I'd be painting or making photograms with my dad in the darkroom. I'd have all sorts of projects all over the house. My mom was making prints in the basement, my dad was in the darkroom. It was dirty, with water everywhere and paint and papier mâché. It was very physical. My childhood was very sensory, in that it incorporated all the human senses. We're a small family, I'm an only child. But I never felt that way, I never felt alone. I always felt generosity, and lots of life. We were always laughing. Just creativity and love. I feel really lucky. Once when I was a teen, he was teaching at the university. I had problems with a friend, a boyfriend, and other problems that I can't even remember anymore but I went to his office at the university and I started talking about my problems. He looked at me and he listened, and he didn't say anything other than: "Sit down here and turn to face the window." And then he took my photo. We didn't really talk more than that. I've always felt really close to my dad. Almost like we didn't have to talk to understand each other. I think we've always been quite sensitive to each other's emotions. How he feels is very important to me. I feel really close to him. I'm always worried about him. I always want him to drive less, or to go out less, especially at night. I'm always scared that he'll slip on the ice or fall on the sidewalk. Because that has happened several times. But what's extraordinary about my dad is that, like a child, he won't start being afraid. He'll just keep going. My dad, he never stops. He's funny. But he's not "ha-ha" funny, he's funny in a subtle way. And his humour, I think, is the humour of Central Europe. I can recognize it in my family, in my surroundings, in the literature, from the atmosphere. So it's very familiar. The tie is by Henry Saxe. If you don't like it, I'll give you another one. I love it. It's me in 20 years. This one. I arrived in the summer of 1971. There was an exhibition, and we got there, and Peter introduced me to Gabor and Doreen. They were the first artists I'd met here in Canada. For me, it was sort of reassuring, because I didn't know anyone here other than Peter and his parents. Knowing that Gabor came from Hungary, he was like me, in a way. So it reassured me a little. I'd met people who came from my part of the world, so I could get my bearings. And from there, we slowly and gradually become friends. And when you have that kind of connection or friendship, you can say that you're home. I remember when he told me, "I want to take your portrait." I said, "Sure, whenever you want." So then he came over, and he just started taking pictures. He sent me the contact sheet, saying that he wanted to enlarge one and he asked me to choose the one I liked best. I said no. No way! "You choose! It's your art. I can't tell you what to do." So he chose this photo, which is now in my house. When I saw it, I said, "That's an extraordinary portrait." It could be of anyone... Well, not anyone, I guess. But I don't have the impression that it's my own portrait. It's an excellent portrait. Cheers! Tell them that if they're alive... If you are all alive, you're invited to my 100th... -Here! -At the same place! At the arena! I started taking pictures at art exhibition launches in the late 1950s. Until 1980. When I started, there weren't many of them. Maybe one or two per month in a few galleries. And it was mostly thanks to Doreen, my wife, who introduced me to her artist friends, because she was also an artist. So the museum decided to publish a book of 100 photos with texts. It's going to be a beautiful book. Maybe it will be my last project, a book that documents these events that were so important in my life. So I'm excited to see the book. What a handsome guy! You think I took this picture because of her butt? I really liked developing film, seeing the image slowly appear on the paper. It's still like magic for me. And then making a contact sheet, choosing photos from it, marking the best ones. I see great photos from back then that I had initially ignored. I mean, of course I'd seen it, but it didn't speak to me back then. So I don't know if this is about nostalgia, or simply that my interest in photographic images has changed. I don't try to explain. It's part of reality. We all change. We have to accept change. So will you accept... You told me last week you had some problems with your eyes. Do you think that one day, you'll stop taking photos? No. I have a disease that may lead to... How do you say "blindness"? Aveugle. Devenir aveugle. Yes, I may go blind. But with the vitamins I'm taking and the glasses I wear, it's not a problem. No, my eyes are quite all right. I mostly just have vision problems when I read. It's true that my eyes get tired. Or I fall asleep. But for taking photos, I'm just fine. It will be fantastic, Gabor. It will be fantastic. We're looking forward to seeing you. -Fantastic? -Fantastic. -And you're here too! -I'm happy to see your place. It's true, you've never been. The home of the great Michel Campeau! Gabor was introduced to me in the early 1970s by Ron Solomon, who was the photography curator at the NFB in Ottawa. He was the first important photographer I ever met. I'm hungry. You had to bring your own supper! Right away, when I met Gabor, I totally identified with his world. I admired his accomplishments, his work, his lifestyle too. A little family, a happy artistic life, intellectual work and all that. I could totally relate to that. I think I also thought of him as something of a father, a spiritual or aesthetic father. He supported me in my art, there's no doubt about that. Hold on a sec. What's this? My dear friends! I'm so happy to be celebrating the solstice with all of you. The idea was that everyone would present a few slides of their work. And the pleasure of being together, Michel! Well, of course! I already said that! This is a photo of my family: my mom, my aunt, and my uncle. This is a man looking at my mom while my mom looks at my dad who's taking the picture. We find these strange moments in our family slides, don't we? The camera is on the bar and we're having a kissing free-for-all. This is life and love and friendship and we celebrate it with glee! Like we're doing here. Gabor was at the burial of my mother, Georgette, and he even took some photos, believe it or not. Somewhere in my house I have the contact sheets for my mom's funeral, from Gabor's photos at the Notre-Dame-des-Neiges cemetery. That's really something. I think that he knew that it was an exceptional moment, for me and maybe for him, too. I mean, he knew what it meant, the presence or absence of a mother. No social commentary, these are just family photos. This was our wedding in London, Ontario, in 1964. It wasn't me who took this shot. Who took it? No comment. Gabor, is this really the first time you've shown these photos? Yes. This is Doreen in Atlantic City. Andrea and I, comparing muscles. Pierre Gaudard and Gabor Szilasi on Mont Washington. Pierre Gaudard was a close friend, a French photographer. Unfortunately, he's gone now. And that's it. You once told me that sometimes you remember taking the photo, and other times you don't really remember. Do you remember taking this one? Yes, this one I remember. After the revolution, there was a week of joy and of calm. But after that, the Russian tanks rolled in and that's what you see in this shot. The terror has returned. -The calm before the storm. -Yes. Well, I'll make another one. This negative is really tricky. It was tough when I printed it the first time, too. But this image is really important. This one's no good either. A quick exposure here... And? -It looks okay. -Yes, not bad. I can see the details in the sky. Yes, I think it will be good. I left Romania after trying to leave for two years. I only succeeded due to a fairly extraordinary set of circumstances. I got to Montreal and my lover was here, his parents were here too. And I would make a life here. But when I learned how Gabor had left Budapest, it was clear that he left under absolutely horrible conditions. I could allow myself the luxury, even though I left under very difficult conditions, I could allow myself the luxury of saying, "I'm not so sure if I like it here." It's not that I wanted to go back to Romania. Absolutely not. But I was able to give myself time to integrate. But for Gabor, I have the impression that it was a sink-or-swim kind of situation. And that was the case for me too, eventually. But I wasn't aware of it, because the stakes weren't the same. And later, quite a bit later, maybe only seven or eight years ago, he started talking to me about his family. I never knew, up to that point, that he'd had a brother and a sister. That was a shock. Because if you look at him, he's open and generous, funny, witty and intelligent. He knows an amazing number of things. He reads, he is cultivated and all that. But he only opens up so far. After that, the door is closed. I was born in Budapest in 1928. My parents were Jewish, from middle class families. Due to growing antisemitism in Hungary, they decided to convert to Christianity, so I was raised as a Lutheran. I went to high school at the Evangélikus Gimnázium in Budapest. When the Nazi German army entered Budapest in 1944, the antisemitic Hungarian Arrow Cross Party started to round up the Jews, the gypsies, the homosexuals and all others who didn't fit into the Nazi Aryan ideal. My father worked in a forced labour camp close to Budapest, but he could come home in the evenings. As for us, my mother, my brother and I, we were arrested by the police and brought to a school where they were gathering up undesirables. Thanks to a good friend of my father, János and I were able to get out of the school but unfortunately, my mother was separated from us. She was deported and she died in the Stutthof concentration camp in Germany. Should I do it again? How was it for you to dig back into those memories? It was a little painful. But you know, with everything that happened during the fascist era in Hungary, I've forgotten some of it. But I think of my mother often. It's emotional for me. I remember they started compiling statistics and conducting research on the gypsies and the Jews. They measured our noses, our ears, our mouths and everything, complete with photos. It was research to show that Jews have big noses, that gypsies had dark brown skin. My father had a really good friend, a Catholic. Risking his own safety, he was able to get us out. I never asked my father what happened, if there was money involved, or... And I regret that, but I never asked him, and he never told me about it. I don't know why he wasn't able to get our mother out. So she was deported and she died in a concentration camp. He never spoke about his past when I was growing up. So I had a gap in my mind about these historical facts. I always wondered: did he not talk about it because it was too hard for him to talk about his parents and family? Because he wanted to start over here in Canada? Or was it that he didn't want me to think of those terrible things, because I'm his daughter? His father lived with us. I was 11 or 12 when his father died, I think. And I remember visiting him in his room, it was like going into another apartment. He had these old paintings, his encyclopedias and old wooden furniture. It was very Hungarian. I played school with him, like I was his teacher and he was my student. Sometimes he gave me and my friends money to buy candy at the corner store. But I never talked to him about his past. It never occurred to me. And my mom never really talked about it either. I think I'd have liked him to talk to me about it, because just talking about something shows that it's possible to discuss difficult things that happen. But it remained mysterious, and that made everything harder. When I was a young teen, my dad wanted to go to Budapest to show me the house where he used to live. That was a time when my dad wanted to be closer to me, to show me things. They're in no hurry. And I regret that I wasn't as receptive then as I would be today. He wanted to talk one night, and I was just like, "I'm going to sleep." He said he felt less close to me, and that was painful to hear. I didn't jump on the opportunity to talk or to cry together, just to have that contact. Maybe I subconsciously felt like that door was closed, and I was happy to leave it closed. On our last trip to Budapest, it wasn't like in the movies where there's a communication breakthrough where all the unasked questions get answered. But just being there together was good. I felt like the silences were rich and full. You said that here in Budapest, we are the survivors? Excuse me. Hello? Mária, please come back. Tell Zoli that I can't talk to him. That was one of my students who now works as a sound man. Really? Yes, that's his profession. -Like him? -Yes. You know, the last one who died from our class was Ilyes Györgei. -You visited him a few times. -Yes. In the 70s and 80s, with my wife Doreen, we came to Budapest every three years. So you saw him several more times. Yes, and I took a picture of you. I even sent it to you. You were the two handsomest ones, eh? What do you mean? Like visually? Do you mind? My hearing is a bit poor. She asked if we were the handsomest in school. I said we were not. Him yes, but I've never been very handsome. I don't remember when you left Hungary. In 1956. -In 1956. -Yeah. I tried to get out in 1949, but they caught us at the border. I was in prison for five months. And after, I couldn't go back to study medicine. I started working in construction, building the Budapest metro. And that's when I bought a Russian camera, a Zorki. That's when I started taking pictures. I remember that Zorki. I still have it, but it no longer works. It's a museum artifact. Did you know that he'd gone to prison? You didn't know that I was in prison, did you? You never told me that. That's because I wasn't proud of being a prisoner. But I don't mind talking about it. Can I take a picture of you with Mária? It's not against the rules. A candid photo. Now a real artistic photographer is taking our picture. That's right. Here we go. The best is how the photographer is being photographed. Yes. As he does his work. By several people. A real Mona Lisa smile. Thank you. -Bye István. -Goodbye. And I'll be back. Next year, maybe. Let me call the elevator. Bye. It's very hard to go back. It's hard. You go back to a place where you know everything, your feet know the stones in the street. It's no longer the same. You still have good memories, because it was your youth. But it's hard. You have your memories in your head, but when you go back and see the street corner you know so well, the restaurant where you went with your friends, the café by the university that is now gone... It's terrible. Going to the cemetery, that's what you do when you return to your native land. I don't want to come back to live here. I've lived two-thirds of my life in Canada. In Montreal. And I like it there. All my friends are there. It has really become my country. So here, I'm a bit of a tourist, but that's okay. Maybe you've started to look at the exhibition. These are forty years' worth of archives by three photographers about friendship. I'll try to keep this simple. And I'd say that at the same time, it's a mirror project, because each visitor recognizes the images that they see in their own history. That's all I have to say. So have a good trip. Have a good projection. The mirror is yours! It's a work that celebrates friendship, life, our families. I'd say about this project that we're wearing our cameras over our hearts, first and foremost. And again, I can only thank my friend Gabor. Can I say a few words? I love this exhibition. It's a bit nostalgic, but it's an important work about the development of documentary photography here and everywhere else. This exhibition really touches me. Not just because it's from our youth. We look a lot younger, it's normal. But especially, it's really the energy of the photographers of the time. We documented what was important in their lives. So thank you for that. When I take a picture, it's one 125th of a second. At the time, I am present at the scene, so I know what happened the minute before and the minute after. Yes, what I see right away is important, but there's surely something that holds me, that I feel strongly when I capture that 125th of a second. Which becomes the past. Yes, which becomes the past. Because for you, the present moment has always been important. Yes. And it's the only thing that a camera can capture: the present moment. And that's so different from cinema or video, because we know what happened when the person enters the image or leaves it. For me, photography is a poem, but cinema is more like a novel. This and this. -And all this. But not this. -Okay. When we get to that point, we'll ask you. I don't want to bring things that shouldn't come with us. -These ones? -Yes. -But not these? -No, that's paper. -And this? -No. This yes. And this? No. Okay, we'll put that aside right away. All these, and those four there. There are four in the back? There are five. Ten boxes, Alain? Yeah, I think that should be enough for now. We don't want to make too many. Let me get my camera. I'm going to need some sleeves, Serge. Seventy years of photos, leaving. -Seventy years? -Yes. Incredible. That's a whole life. Well, yeah. We collected 13 boxes and one flat document with those two big boxes of negatives. Fourteen in total. Received by Alain. Today is March 19. I need you to sign here, and then I'll give you a copy. Thank you, Mr. Gabor. -Take care, drive safe! -Thanks. -See you. -Bye. It's not just a job, being a photographer. It's who he is, and with my mother and me, it's part of us, our bodies and our selves. In all ways. So I was worried, because I felt that it was the largest part of our lives and our past and our existence as a family. It wasn't being lost, but it was leaving. Or it no longer existed in the same way. It's coming. Did it hit the ceiling? -Gabor, cheers! -Thank you. To your good work, which will live on. Thank you. What's coming up next for you? In the next years, what do you wish for? Continuing good health, to start. Good food. As happy a life as is possible. I don't think about whether I have five years left or ten years. I'm not so worried about that. If I died right away, I would die a happy man. Maybe that won't be in the film. No, I'm happy with my life. Particularly because I have an extraordinary family that I really love. And finally, the best thing in life is love. Love forever. Isn't that a song?
