My name's Vishnu. I belong to Vizag. I'm a photographer. Newspaper, phone or TV... there's always some disturbing news on each platform. What disturbed me was... the Hyderabad serial killer news. Breaking News! Hyderabad city in the hands of a psycho! A psycho killer becoming the city's worst nightmare with a series of killings. Many innocent lives have been taken. We think we're not related to something happening in remoteness. But, things were different in my case. That killer had entered my life. Not just my life. The reason 2 other lives have also been shattered is... this Highway! Where's my camera? Mom! Where's my camera? Shweta... Shweta... Granny... Why did you guys stop? -Hush! Oh! He's here. Didn't I tell you not to touch my camera? Please, bro. Pinky from next door is showing off that she has more followers. This video will definitely go viral. Please, bro. You need my camera for your shitty reels? Why would we use your camera if our reels were shitty? We worked really hard and learned one move. Granny is also doing well. Only single video. Please, bro. [all] Please let us do it. Please! Alright. But on one condition. Will you pack all my stuff? Will you? -Yes. Yes. We will. Cool then. Ready! Minister's calling. Hello, sir. We're already on the way. Yeah, the photographer's tagging along. Yes, ma'am. The same photographer who clicked that crow with its tail up. We'll be there. Vishnu! Do you think this is fair? I'm your mom. Show some mercy. Is the entire family coming? There's no space on the vehicle. Umm... Hi. They aren't a part of the plan. A small jugaad, bro. You handle it. Samudram, you tell him. Didn't you carry him for 9 months? Take this. Here. This one as well. -What?! Let's go. -Hey! Come here. I didn't want to ask where we were going and jinx it. Where are we going? Aren't you jinxing now? -Come on, tell me! We're going to Bangalore. Your son is going to shoot a grand duet. After this song, he'll become a top cameraman. And I will become his Event Manager. What duet? Are you guys into films now? It's not a film. It's a wedding. Duets with the bride and the groom have become a thing now. How low could you guys steep? You know marriage is full of trouble. Let them have some good memories. Don't forget to eat the sweets, dear. Bye! Bye! See you. -Bye! Are you done? -Hmm. Let me do it. Go and have dinner. I'll do this. Let's eat together. Alright. -Look at that. Go. Get inside. Now! Rangamma, what's up! Why is she hiding from me? She just returned from work, sir. When can I marry her? Sir, you provided us a shelter and livelihood. She's like your daughter. How could you propose marriage? You don't mind feeding on my money. But now she's too young for me, huh? People are literally laughing at me... that I couldn't get laid with my worker. Thulasi! Sir, I'm begging you. Please don't do this. -I'm going to take her with me. Sir, please! -Hey, Thulasi! Come on! Let's go! -Mom! Please let her go. Thulasi, run! Hey, Thulasi! Stop right there! You can't run from me. Hey, you! Thulasi! Thulasi! Hey! Where are you? Thulasi! Hey! Thulasi! Thulasi! Thulasi! I'll not let you go. You can't get away from me. Got you! Where do you think you were going? How long are you going to run from me? Come on! You and your mom can't fool me anymore. Go away! Shit! Let's go. Hurry! Come on! Stay here. Here. I want you to get out of here. Mom?! I could save you today. But you never know about tomorrow. Before he wakes up, I want you to get out of here. Where should I go, mom? All this time, I haven't told you where your dad is. After he abandoned us, he got married again. He's working in Mangalore as a railway line man currently. Go there. Your dad will take care of you. What about you, mom? His new family won't welcome me. But I'm sure they'll take you in. If I tag along, Kasi will definitely hunt us down. How can I survive alone, mom? Don't be scared, Thulasi. God will look after the vulnerable ones. That spirit will guide you throughout the way. Those eyes must've dreamed a zillion things. Tape on the eyes. Same pattern. Same style. It's his signature. He wants the girls to watch all the torture. That gives him a high. He enjoys the pain! Bastard! Any leads? As usual, ma'am. We found the same cigarette bud and tire marks. No other clues. FSL is still searching, ma'am. We've informed all the police stations in close proximity. Dog squad is on the way. He hasn't left behind a single clue in any of his murders. He seems smarter than you. Would you agree to that? He thinks he's smart. Please don't glorify the killer. And please don't make him a hero for TRPs. Within no time, we'll catch that basta... We'll catch that killer. Parents are terrified to send their girls outside. What do you say to them? I have a young sister. I'm looking for the same answer. 5 murders! No motives. No traces. Why does he hate those girls so much? How is he just going invisible? How, Praveen? Who is he? When will they give our increments? In June or July apparently. Excuse me. When will the bus to Mangaluru arrive? There are no direct buses to Mangaluru. You should catch a connecting bus from Vijayawada. There's a bus every hour. Get inside, dear. Generally, they don't serve chicken biryanis at weddings, sir. And who eats biryani first thing in the morning? We should be there by 6. Hey! Aanamuru, man! -So what? Aanamuru's Bilal Biryani is world famous! We should definitely try it on this route. Rakul Preet Singh tweeted the same, dude! Please, man. Didn't you just lecture someone about biryani? Man, we might not get the chance again. I'm dying to taste it, man. Please! Alright. Do you know the address? In villages like these, somebody must be waiting to give us directions. Ma'am... Victim's name is Sahithi. Aged 21. Engineering student. She stepped out at 08:30 for shopping. When she didn't get back home, her mom got worried and came down here to check. Her car was in bad shape. So she intimated the cops. Since it's a girl abduction case, they informed us, ma'am. Hand over the evidence. Sir. We found her mobile on the spot. Checked her call log. Any time frame? -Yeah. This is the CCTV footage from the store. She left at 09:20. It takes 5 minutes to reach the parking lot. Between 09:25 and 09:30... is the estimated abduction time frame. There's no CCTV camera here? No eye-witnesses? Where's the Management? Not even a security guard? Ma'am, installation is still unfinished in this basement. There aren't many CCTV cameras. Since it's already 09:30, there's not much footfall either. Alert all the check posts immediately. Tighten the security. Half burned cigarette in a no-smoking zone. And that too the same brand. I'm sure it's him. Before he does something to her, we need to save Sahithi. Let's go, Praveen. -Yes, ma'am. Those rascals are back! Getting sloshed and creating a mess all the time. Bloody drunkards! -Don't be so whiny. Hush! The more silent you are... the quicker you'll be home. Mom and dad must be waiting. You want to go home, right? I saw the van come this way. Where did it go? There! Hey! Who's in there? Huh? Speak out! What the hell! Who did this to you, dear? Alas! Who did this to you, dear? Tell me! He ruined it. Bloody old man! Grandma! Grandma! Grandma! Water's not coming! Water's not coming! Can't you hear ? Water's not coming! I think she's deaf. Somebody open the door. I'm stuck inside! Anybody there? Open the door! Anybody there? Open the door! Anybody there? Open the door! Good evening, ma'am. Cause of death? Stab wound in sternum, ma'am. We found an earring in this towel. Abhinaya... -Yes, ma'am! Click a picture and send it to Sahiti's mother. Find out if this belongs to Sahiti or not? Okay, ma'am! Praveen -Ma'am! Look at the wheel distance. It's definitely a bigger vehicle. Foot prints are in between, which means there is a backdoor. Measure these tire marks and contact patches... and find out the vehicle. Ma'am, it's confirmed. The earring belongs to Sahiti. Praveen -Ma'am! Just imagine! As soon as he abducted her, he got her here! Rangayya stopped him while he was trying to attack her. He came as a problem and that's why he is killed here. Poor man! It means there's a chance that she could still be alive. Since he couldn't do it here , he must've taken her to a similar place. But our men are all over the place. So, he'll try and go outside the city. Praveen. -Ma'am! Tolls, check posts... Check everywhere! You should check each and every vehicle thoroughly. Sure, ma'am. Open the door! Six, seven, eight... What is it, dear? Where are you going alone in the night? Tell me! What happened? Bus! Bus left. Don't worry. I am here. Don't get scared. Listen to me. I am like your, uncle. Trust me. Speak to me, dear. What took you so long? Ah, come on! Do you know I've been waiting for you? Who are you? What's your business with her? What do you want ? She is all alone. Poor girl. I was helping... As if you really mean to help. Guys like you are always look for innocent women to prey on. Come. Let's go. You go mind your own business. Acting like a bloody stud. What happened? What are you doing here? It's not safe around here. Don't cry. Why are you crying? Let's sit first. Sit! Stay strong! Treat me like your sister and tell me whatever happened. I started from home to find my dad. When the bus stopped here, I got down to use the loo. Somebody locked it from the outside. Meanwhile the bus left. Is it? Where does your father live? Mangalore. There are no buses currently to Mangalore. Okay. Don't cry. Stay here for tonight. Tomorrow I will get you on that bus. Don't cry! You should stay strong! I will be right here. Okay? Open the gates! Quick! Move! Move! I saw this house somewhere. Hey, all the roads look the same in this city. I doubt we are going in a circle. What happened to the vehicle? Hey! Hey! Hey! What happened? Vehicle stopped. I can see that. I am asking you why. Hey! Where are you going without telling me? What's the problem? I don't know either. Then why did you open the bonnet? This is what they generally do in films, right? Oh shit! There are no mechanics around here. Not just mechanics. There are no humans either. Yes, bro! People in villages generally sleep early. That guy Bilal is to blame for this. Where are we right now ? Bro you are lucky even in such an unlucky situation. Jaya Dhaba is only 3 km away. Jaya means? Your Aunt! My Crush! God exists. He knows what we want. Otherwise... Why did we asked Bilal for address on the way to Bangalore? We missed the route because of him and ended up here. Why did the vehicle break down in the middle of the road? God knows it! How to unite my heart with Jaya's. Hey! She is my aunt. So what? You also call me 'Uncle' sometimes. That's all well and good. What about the vehicle? Hey! You still doubt God won't take us to Jaya Dhaba? God has sent a good vehicle, bro. Looks like we'll make it to the event in time. Forget about the event. How will we get to Jaya Dhaba? Hey! Hold On! You are so lucky! This will be the last face you've seen. Bloody hell! Random people come and disturb during the night. What? Do you want a room ? It will be Rs 500/- till 7 in the morning. You need to pay Rs 1000/- as advance. No returns if you stay past 7'o clock. Write down your details and pay Rs 1000/- Don't know how to sign? Cast your finger print. Are you dumb? Full details are mandatory. You can't get a room otherwise. We'll get into trouble. I have seen a lot of guys like you. I won't get scared even if you look at me like that. Damn, I'm sleepy. Sign here. Or leave! Are you deaf as well? Write down your details or leave! Random people barge in at night to disturb my sleep! They won't let me get a minute's sleep, man. You didn't leave yet? Pass that phone. Yeah, what? Is Saroja there? No. He wants Saroja it seems. If she comes, I will get her on the bed with you, okay? Don't call me again. Okay. Bro? You're looking for fun? You should have told me before. We have all types of rooms here! I will give you a nice room. We have separate rooms for lorry drivers. For people like you, we have VIP rooms. Here, we have all the facilities. Hot water too. Go, bro ! Bro? Come here! Saroja is coming. Shall I send her in? Tell saroja thanks on my behalf. Thanks to Saroja? Why would he say that? Tulasi! Go freshen up and come. Vishnu! She is praying for me! Bullcrap! Come on! Hey, Mom packed that for me ! Mad fellow! God gave me this to give it to her. Aunty! Aunty! Aunty! Hey, Vishnu! Hi, aunty! You remember me after so long? Never forgot you. You appear in dreams daily. Samudram, how are you? You are so beautiful! What? Sweets. Even though he said no, I made sure to prepare these for you. Sweets! Who told you I like sweets? Did I ever tell you that I like you? Mom made these for you. Okay. You must be tired. Go take a shower. Did you use this towel? -Hmm. Smells like daisies! Hey, Samudram! Stop! Have tea! Thank you, aunty! Tea is superb, aunty. Tastes like elixir. Who do you think made it? An angel! Is it? Don't flatter me with your talk. Where were you headed? Bangalore, aunty. For a Minister's Daughter's wedding. We got the deal because of the photographs he took. His magic! Vishnu! You will be passing by Ananthapur, right? Yes! Vishnu! Look at that girl. Her name is Tulasi. She missed her bus when she got down at our dhaba last night. She is going to Mangalore to meet her dad. You're going that way, right ? Drop her home, please. Aunty, it will be difficult to drop her till Mangalore. We can drop her at the Kalyandurga bus stop. There will be a lot of buses from there, okay? So sweet ! The other cheek? Tulasi ! Come here. He is Vishnu. My son-in-law. He is Samudram. Greetings! They're good guys. They are going to Bangalore. I told them to board you on the bus to Mangalore. You guys make sure she gets on the Mangalore bus. Okay, aunty! -Cool? Cool. Praveen! -Yes, ma'am! To reach this spot, one needs to cross the Gachibowli toll. There's no other way! Abhinaya! -Ma'am! Immediately go to the toll gates and check carefully. Okay, ma'am! Between 01:30-3 AM last night, whatever vehicles crossed, check them thoroughly. And check the CCTV footage ASAP. We cannot miss a single vehicle. If you find anything suspicious, give me a call. Sure, ma'am. Praveen! -Ma'am! If we assume the murder time as 1:30 AM at Gachibowli, It will take 30 min to reach here. After that, that bastard did whatever he wanted to do with that girl. Which means, he left at 2:30 AM from here. This spot is 30 kms away from the city. If he wanted to go back, he wouldn't come till here. So, he has no other choice than to go out of the city. I think he is on the highway, Praveen! That means, the distance between him and us is... Just 4 hours gap! After all these days of hunting, for the first time we're so close and he doesn't know that. That's his confidence! And that is our plus point. How can we be so sure? Praveen! We can't sit back anymore. Sometimes we have to follow our intuition! We have to think like him and take a chance. And also... Don't let the Sahiti murder go out to the press. Give me one day! We can't give him the high that he wants, Praveen. Let's go. Hello. You don't have to be scared. Just relax. We have 10 more hours of travel. So you can talk to us freely. Let me know if you need anything. Don't be shy. I have an idea. I'll go first. My name is Vishnu. I am an event photographer. He is samudram. Event manager. Hi. He gets the leads for events. We do events together. Actually... We're going from vizag To Bangalore for an event. Now, you tell me. Your name? I know it's tulasi. I heard you are going to Mangalore to see your dad. Jaya aunty told me. By the way, why are you traveling alone? Your folks aren't coming along? How did you reach that dhaba? How will you go to your house Once you get down at mangalore? Why didn't your dad Come to receive you? Shit. Even I will cry if you Ask so many questions. Look how she is crying. Please calm down. Please don't cry. Whenever you feel like saying it , say it. Hey, look at those trees. That grass. Hey, see. See. See. The dog. Praveen, stop. Stop here. Go back. There is a hotel there, look. No rooms available here. Hey. Police. Who is that ? Sir, it's Saroja, sir. Saroja who ? She is the maid here, sir. Where is the register? How many rooms in total? How many are vacant? 8, rooms sir. How many are filled? -3 rooms, sir. When did they check-in? One at 9:30, sir. Other guy... -Why are you anxious? No sir, one guy at 11:30 and the other guy is staying from 3 days. I will put you behind bars if anything goes wrong. Wait. Come here. Madam is calling . Come here. Madam. Greetings, madam. How many rooms are there? 8, madam. How many got filled? -3, madam. What's 8 minus 3? 1..2..3..4.. 5, madam. Why do you only have 4 keys then? Sorry, madam. I didn't get paid from three months. My owner's not paying me. I got tempted after looking at 2000 rupee note. I swear, madam. I asked him to sign the register. But he just left. Is he here now? Which room? 101, madam. Let's go. Wait. Where is it ? Which room? That room, madam. You stay here. He left, ma'am. Same cigarette bud. -Yes, ma'am. Look at his confidence. Praveen . Call the forensics. Make sure you check all the prints in the room... and tire marks around the hotel. Okay, ma'am. What's your name? Khaja, madam. Didn't you notice him leave? I was outside from 6'o clock, ma'am. No way he could've passed me through. Do you remember his face? Yes, madam. He is a super weird guy. I remember him. Praveen. -Ma'am. Get a sketch artist and make him sit with him. Madam. What's the fuss anyway? He killed a lot of innocent women. Oh, my Saroja. Praveen. -Ma'am. He must have left in between 05:30-06:00. That means... The gap between him and us is reduced by two hours. Let's start. -Yes, ma'am. Tulasi... When problems like this occur, you should've called your mom or dad right? I don't have a phone with me. What? You don't have a phone? Tell me your mom's number , I call her. Even my mom doesn't have a phone. Is it? When you go out sometimes, how do you talk to your mother? Me and mom are together all the time. You don't go to school or college? Me and mom, from my childhood... are working in that poultry farm. My uncle didn't allow us to go out. Long back, once me and mom... went to the market in a town near to us and that was it. Okay. Ma'am. They found the tire prints outside that hotel. Same prints. Forensic people just confirmed them. Same cigarette bud. Same tire marks. Praveen, what about the sketch? -Working on it, ma'am. Shit. How did I miss this small logic? Ma'am? Yes, Ma'am? Listen to me carefully. Look for vehicles which passed the tolls on the days of the killings. If there is any vehicle repeated , let me know right away. Alright? Yes, Ma'am, I am on it. Ma'am. But how does it matter? Just think, Praveen. Till now 6 killings took place. All of them happened in the city outskirts. I am sure he would have passed the tolls on those dates. If we can find one such vehicle, that's the killer's vehicle. There's no coincidence. It's an absolute trace. Praveen. -Ma'am. The real hunt is on now! Kumar. Someone's at the door. Coming, sister. What do you want? Tea. Sister, he want's tea. Go, I will look after these. Okay. Hey kiddo, my tire got punctured. Will you help me change it? No, bro. I got loads of work here. Sure? Hundred rupees?! I fix tires all the time, bro. Where's the vehicle? You'll see. Hey, Kumar! Kumar. Kasturi. Where's Kumar? What is this ? You should have come out, right? Hey, order one more tea for me. Take it. No, thanks. It's okay, take it. Hey, do you think we can reach the event in time? If you ask me , I doubt it. The route we took... Your focus seems to have shifted that way. You said if you come across the one, you'll know. Don't tell me she's the one. Hey, it's not like that. I feel sorry for what she's going through at such a young age. I don't even think she ever had a chance to dream. Who knows in what situation her folks sent her. Imagine how it is for her. She's never stepped out of her town. I guess she didn't even enjoy those small little joys of life. Few lives are written that way. We can't help it. I have a plan. We will go to our favourite spot. Are you mad? We need to reach the venue in time. We can go to Bangalore from there. A small detour, that's all. I feel sorry for her, man. I don't know how her situation will be once she reaches Mangalore. At least the time she is spending with us now, she shouldn't forget in her lifetime. "Has the coy bird finally spread her wings?" "Have her hopes began to bloom?" "Has the breeze helped her flow?" "Have the skies led her way?" "Oh so many joys" "Where were they hiding this whole time?" "All these happy moments" "And many more in this beautiful world" "Oh so many joys" "Where were they hiding this whole time?" "All these happy moments" "And many more in this beautiful world" "Those days of inhibition have passed" "Beautiful times have embraced me" "Oh so many joys" "Where were they hiding this whole time?" "All these happy moments" "And many more in this beautiful world" "My eyes witness a new sunrise today" "World wonders feel petty when she shines" "Feels wonderful" "Travelling with her" "Each place is so spectacular" "It has so much to offer me" "These trees, hills and lakes" "They bring home a zillion smiles" "They are my best friends for life" "Oh so many joys" "Where were they hiding this whole time?" "All these happy moments" "And many more in this beautiful world" "I met a princess whose elegance radiates like lightning" "A Queen with the purest heart" "What's wrong in wanting to be with her?" "I finally look up and admire the moon" "It's like I've risen to the surface" "Where will these moments lead?" "Will I end up falling in love?" "Has the coy bird finally spread her wings?" "Have her hopes began to bloom?" "Has the breeze helped her flow?" "Have the skies led her way?" Should we be happy for this girl or cry for the boy? What is this Praveen? I told you that he is completely losing his control. Between the killings until day before yesterday... There was a slight gap. But after Sahiti, look at this. He wanted to kill that girl. Instead, he killed this boy. Now his rage has increased in search of prey. He won't stop. But we need to stop him. Yes. This one . When did you click this one? I'm smooth with my photography. Candid photography. Hey , we only got 11 kms to reach Kalyandurg. Tulasi, do you know how lucky you are? Mangalore bus is waiting for you. Hey, that idiot is calling. Tulasi, bye. Happy and safe journey. Yes, sir. Already on the way, sir. Sorry, sir. Tyre puncture. Please don't scold me. Bus. I have to go. Tulasi... Why do you want to travel alone at night? Come along with us till Bangalore. Once we're done with the event, We can start to Mangalore by evening. I will drop you at your dad's place. Tulasi? You don't believe me or what? Nothing like that . I've never seen my dad in my life. All these years, I didn't even he existed. From the minute I left home, I've only been facing trouble. If I wait any longer, I'm afraid I'll never get to see my dad. It scares me. Come. Take care. One minute. How can we travel when I'm down with diarrhea, sir? Diaper? Where will I find it at this hour? Sir, somehow we will make it in time. Give me the other phone. Ye, sir. Madam wants to speak? Yes, madam? Yeah. Party? Idiot! That's the office phone. Madam. Not you ,madam. Go ahead. Scold me. Tulasi. Take this phone. It's okay. If you press this green button, it will connect to me. Hey , what are you doing at this time ? He's scolding me in every possible way. I'm telling him all the possible lies. I can't manage anymore. Tulasi, happy journey. Hey, you come first , Car engine is also on . Yes, coming. We boarded her like Jaya aunty asked us to. Let's go! Call me when the bus starts. Call me after you reach Mangalore as well. Hmm. Okay. Take care. Sorry bro . We can't reach on time unless I rush you. We'll go to Mangalore once the event is done. Wherever Tulasi is , we'll go and meet her, okay? Stop worrying, man. Ticket. Ticket. What happened? Vehicle broke down, Ramana. We must stall. You heard him. Get down, everybody. Get down. Tulasi called . -Is it? Why did she call so many times? Didn't you ask her to call once the bus starts? Shit. I am trying to call her . But it's not getting through. I think we did a mistake. We should have stayed till the bus moved. We came this far. What do we do now? Man, you can't focus on work in this situation. And I can't see you like this. Tulasi is more important than the event. Take the vehicle and go back to her. How will you go ? -I will manage somehow. Our catering vehicle is one km away. They'll pick me up. Don't waste a second. Please go. Thanks, man. Uncle. You must've seen the bus break down here. Did you notice a young girl in it? Yes, I did. She came up to me. What's up! , dhaba girl! What are you doing here? Come here! It's me. Don't you remember? We met in the dhaba! Come! Come! What happened? You still didn't go to your place? What went wrong? Bus broke down. -What? Bus broke down. Alas! I don't know why bad things are happening to you. It's alright. Where do you have to go ? -Mangalore! Mangalore, is it? I'm also going there. Come with me. Let's go. I will take you. It's okay. Come. What is this, dear? All alone in the middle of the night? I will look after you, come! Come! It's my responsibility to drop you at Mangalore. It was a truck carrying some load. What kind of truck? -It was red in color. Which way did it go? -This way. If you hurry, you might just catch up. Is it ok dear? Why this way? Why this way? Do you think dropping you is my only job? Small work! Once done , we will be on the highway! Don't get scared, girl. Your uncle will take care. Where are you taking me ? Tell me! You said you'll take me to Mangalore, right? Why did you bring me here? If you remain calm for 5 minutes... You will reach Mangalore in five hours. Try to understand, girl. Hush! Why are you talking like this? I trusted you and came along. I need to go to Mangalore. -I will take you! Please take me right away. Nice rain! Just the two of us here. Come on, darling! Hey, wait! Vishnu... -Tulasi! Come here quickly, Vishnu! Tulasi ! Why are you crying? Tulasi! Where are you? Looks like a corn field. Hello! Tulasi! Say something! Why are you crying? I won't leave you. Who the hell are you ? Stop it! -Vishnu! Come on, darling! Don't you dare hurt her! Come on, darling! Where are you going? There's nobody here to help you. Wait, darling! Come on, my darling! Will hug you like this and... -Leave me! Stop him ! Leave me, brother. Please! Let's go. Why are you taking her? No, it's nothing. Ambulance driver? Don't get scared. I am here. Hey, where is she? Where is she? What did you do to her ? Girl? Which girl are You talking about? What the hell! What did you do to her? I listened to everything on the phone. Tell me! Tell me! Tell me! Someone came and hit me, and took the girl with him. Did he take her? Really? Tell me! Why are you lying to me? Get lost! He hit me and so are you! This is unfair. He took her in an ambulance. They're both gone. You must be crazy. This is what you do to a vulnerable girl? She trusted you, right? I shouldn't spare bastards like you. Come! Come! -Bro, no! Yeah, Abhinaya. Ma'am, your idea worked out perfectly. We got it, ma'am. -I'm listening. After tracking all the days of the killings, we spotted one vehicle crossing the toll frequently. Post killings, the same vehicle is crossing the toll regularly. Actually, ma'am... You know why the killer was in invisible mode during killings? It's an ambulance , ma'am. Shit! In an ambulance? No wonder that bastard was invisible. That is why we permitted him to cross the toll as a duty. After watching the CCTV footage from the day of Sahiti's abduction, that vehicle crossed the toll, ma'am. Since it's an ambulance, I showed him the route. I feel so guilty, ma'am. Okay, no problem, Abhinaya. Good work! Just send me whatever details you have and the visuals of the driver. CCTV couldn't capture his face. Each time, he made sure that it was covered with something. And two digits on the number plate are also faded, ma'am. Because it's an ambulance, no one must have observed it. Okay, no problem. Just send me the details. He is highly intelligent, ma'am. No one suspected a thing because it's an ambulance. Bastard! How long is he going to run the show? Praveen. -Ma'am. Send all the details to the entire team. -Yes, ma'am. How did you end up with him? I didn't have a choice. Where are you from?

What I do? I know what you're thinking. I'm an ordinary ambulance driver. I've witnessed a lot of deaths in the ambulance. When their souls would leave the body, I'd feel an usual joy. That's why... I started killing people. When I'd take them off oxygen, I'd see their souls leave the body in pain and fear. I'd feel extremely happy. That's when a beautiful girl came into my life. I thought I'll change and lead a normal life. But she found someone who gave her more pleasure than me. She left me. I couldn't take it. I had sex with her till she begged me to kill her. Finally, she died in pleasure. Ever since, whenever I come across similar looking girls, I feel a strange current pass up my spine. That was when I saw you. You know what’s the difference between you and them? All those girls who got killed in my hands, had someone at home waiting for them, crying for them. But you... You were alone. No one will come looking for you. No one will grieve your death. So, there's no rush. You should slowly realise who I am, right? I got you this far. Did you think I was going to hand you to them? There are a lot of things that we need to do together. I want you to quench my thirst. What do you say? Tell me! Tell me! Tulasi! Tulasi! Tulasi! Tulasi! Hey! Who is he? Tulasi! Tulasi! You're safe. Don't leave me, Vishnu. -Don't get scared, Tulasi. I am here now. Be strong. I'm never leaving you again. Vishnu! Vishnu! Vishnu! Vishnu! Vishnu! Vishnu! Vishnu! Vishnu! Vishnu! To everyone's shock, there was an incident in the forest near Andhra-Karnataka border. The serial psycho killer who made Hyderabad tremble, D alias Das has captured a girl and she has managed to escape. She is Tulasi from Amalapuram. She was kidnapped yesterday. Nature has punished his atrocious acts in its own way. The psycho who has hunted down young girls and harrassing them to death, has become the prey to a hungry tiger in the forest. A wild animal has hunted down a social animal. Is it God's verdict or nature's punishment? Public shall realize. Let's hope that victim Tulasi recovers from this trauma soon.
