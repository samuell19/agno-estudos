Man, I can’t do it. Go, dude. Why don’t you go! It’s your turn today. Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go! Start the bike! Turn it around! Let’s get out of here! Quickly! Wait a minute... Wait! Amrita, listen to me! Don’t go inside! Birth. Death. Pain. Pleasure - - are all consequential. There is always Reason. Nobody worries about what is seen. But, There is always a misconception and fear of the unseen. The things that exist... Why do they? And the things that don’t... Why not? Everything has a Reason. Our quest for unseen Reasons continues with our show - “KAARANA (The Reason)” 90ml of good alcohol gives you a nice buzz, apparently. But we've got more than that tonight! Let's dive into - - our 99th episode! Look at this place... Think of all the things that it has seen, All the possible events that it might have sparked off... All the possible energies that it might have channelled... I wonder how many deaths it has witnessed. At the end of this road is - - the place we will demystify tonight. "The Beehive" An abandoned guesthouse. A few years ago, a lady was found dead here. Then, a few days later - Two young men. And then, - a middle-aged husband and wife. Over the next few weeks, the guesthouse gained a deadly reputation. It was completely forgotten until recently when three young men decided to challenge the 'ghost'. I have ended up making 98 episodes in search of this ghost, my dear viewers. I hope I find him this time. I hope my efforts finally pay off! And it's not just that, I'm like the main guy from Breaking Bad. I want to walk to the ghost's house, And knock on his door! That's how he will know my name. Anyway, ghosts don't exist and that is what we will prove again. Let's go! Gopal! Coming, sir! Gopal? This way, sir. Sir! Please come here. Why don't you come inside, Gopal? What's the matter? Sir, I have shown you the house and I'm giving you the key. Just like my boss told me to. I'm going to leave now, sir. You take care. Why? Are you scared? Yes sir. I must leave now. Gopal! Wait a second. Here you go. No, sir. It's OK. It’s fine. Just keep it. Thank you, sir. So, my dear viewers! Was that a ghost? Let's take a small break! Cut! OK, superb! (STUDIO TECHNICIANS' CHATTER) Sir! These are working hours. Sorry, sir. Focus on your work. The episode must go on-air in three days. Yes, sir. Hi, Sheelam! Hi, sir. All done? OK, ready for take! Ready! Ready! So, what exactly happened there? The ghost was Gopal. Gopal and his wife - - were the caretakers of the guesthouse. Once, two young men who had come there - - raped and murdered his wife. Who did this?! Gopal's love for his wife - - transformed him into a murderer. The murderous rage transformed him into a madman. And now, he is in a mental asylum. So, my dear viewers! Gopal’s story - - and the mystery of The Beehive - - together give us the closure we need. However, for me personally, it has been disappointing. Even in this episode, I could not meet a real ghost. It turned out to be a man yet again! I'm more convinced than ever that man is the 'ghost' we are looking for! Dear God, - - at least next time - - let me meet a real ghost. Please. Good. Very good! Thank you, sir. On one hand, there is the TRP ratings of all the other shows in our channel put together. And then - There is your show! Your ratings are on a different level! Thank you, sir. I am really happy, Sheelam. So - - the 99th episode is done. The next one. The big one! The 100th episode! Any plans? Yes, sir. I am working on a couple of ideas. Good! Excuse me, sir. May I come in? Come in. OK, then. Fine, sir. Sheelam! Remember... Numbers! Take care of numbers! Under no circumstances - - should your show’s ratings drop. Other channels' GRP ratings must not even come close to ours! All the very best! OK, sir. Thank you! Hey! "Take care of your numbers..." - - "Numbers!" - - "The numbers should not drop!" I will die before I let that happen, madam. That animal definitely grew up drinking 'TRP-milk'. He’s not an animal, he’s a monster! One of these days, I will invite him to my cooking show and poison him on live TV. Don't worry. When I take over as the boss, you'll be spared of all the trouble. This guy again! "Forward this message to 20 people -" "- and make your future golden!”. What nonsense! Are you blind?! Bumping into people like a mad bull! This was a good opportunity to flirt with her, but alas! Sorry, Guruji! Please don’t rain fire on me! Siddesha, slow and steady wins the race. No Guruji, slow and steady goes to the grave! Why? What is the need to rush now? There was a huge fight in the show between a husband and his wife. The wife beat him with her high-heeled sandal. His skull’s cracked open, I think. I don’t know if I should take him to the hospital or to the graveyard. Oh God! What about madam? Chandrika madam - Is she OK? She is completely alright, Guruji. She knows exactly how far she needs to be from a fight. She is always in control, you know! Give me your blessings. I will leave now. Bless me, please. When your only purpose is TRP ratings - - then this sort of chaos is inevitable! One cannot predict or control the future! Not everyone is as blessed as Sheelam. 'Blessed'? It seems like you are fully in character for your 'future predicting' show! It’s not a 'future predicting' show. That's not what I do. My show is all about Spiritual Counselling. When you talk about things like horoscope and astrology, people will want to know their futures! That will never change, Guruji. Forget it. We must stop engaging in mysticism and start living in reality. Being alive is not the purpose of life! Achieving high TRP numbers should be the purpose, you say? That should be the only purpose! Of course! Sir! These numbers make or break a TV channel. Numbers drive the channel. Channel drives the numbers. Makes sense, Sheelam? Yes, sir. To explain it clearly to you, the FUTURE of a TV channel depends on these numbers! Did you get the joke? Very good, sir! You know about that channel called “KA TV”? Their astrology show - - gets better TRP ratings than ours! They use things like amulet, coins and holy water to make it more thrilling! What have you been doing? Think of something like Doomsday! I can’t be shameless like that, sir. Guruji, people will watch only if you are shameless. Look at the kind of sensational things that other Guruji does! Watch him and learn! Guruji, I have great respect for you and your beliefs. But - - What about your numbers?! Once you decide to do a TV show, you must do some kind of a gimmick! Numbers are what we depend on now... Numbers are what we will depend on in the FUTURE. Got the joke? Come with me, Guruji. We have a lot to discuss. Rajeev! Yes? Baby, they are all ready. OK, let's go. We are in the 5th place... How do you feel about that? What do you all do here? I have given everything you need and in return, instead of numbers, all you give me is a big fat nothing! I don’t care how you do it. I want a plan right now! Why are you looking at each other’s faces? Do it now! Your attention please! We women need to stop living in fear. For that, we need get stronger. We must learn to protect ourselves. Pavitra, please come here. I will show a demonstration to you now. Watch what I do carefully. Pavitra, help me out with this. Sure. One. Two. Three and four. 'She is teaching us how to protect ourselves.' What I just showed you is not difficult at all! When someone attacks us, we must know more than just self defence. We must learn to counter-attack. It is not difficult to learn. Look at this. Can we do all this wearing a saree? By God, no! Can one of you please come here? One of us? It's for a demonstration. Oh! No, thanks. That guy looks familiar! It's him, the ghost hunter! Come fast! Do you remember that thing I had taught you? We'll do that again. You need to attack me the same way, OK? Ammu, where exactly do you want me to attack you first? Can any one of you come up here? I will come! Oh, good! Amrita! What's this? (COMMOTION IN THE CROWD) Hello, sir. Step forward a little, please. Why does your wife even need a self-defence class, sir? I truly understand your pain. I can even feel it. Thank you. See you. Take care, sir. Goodbye. Get inside now! Hey. Hey! Don’t ask me to come to your classes from now on. I will not. Hey! You don't miss a chance, do you? Here you go, sir. Thank you. Welcome. Hello? Who is it? Yes mom, did you guys reach? Hello, sir. Hi. One jackfruit. OK. Do you really have a chilli flavour? Yes sir, do you want to taste it? No, no. 'She might like it though.' Give me one scoop of that and one scoop of this. OK, sir. Please sit. Thank you. OK, mom. Alright. Please tell God that I said hello. OK, bye. They reached Kukke today. (A temple town.) They will be back tomorrow morning. The minute they see me, they will bring up the topic again. What have you decided, Sheelam? I have been ready looking forward to getting married since I was a kid. Please be serious, Sheelam. It’s not that easy to handle them, you know? What do they want? They want you to quit your job. And then what? Will they give me pocket money? Excuse me, sir. What do you want me to do? Quit my job? Do you know how scared I get when you go alone looking for ghosts? What? I don't look for ghosts! They are not even a real thing! Wait, don't tell me you are serious about getting scared of ghosts! That really doesn’t matter! My parents must accept you completely. It’s in your hands to convince them. What do you mean by 'accept completely'? OMG! Oh, my God! Sir, you are Sheelam, aren’t you? I am so happy to see you, sir! I am a huge fan of you! See this, sir... I always carry your book with me. I love you so much, sir. If you don’t mind, can I take a selfie with you? Sure! Madam, please move a little. Thank you so much, sir! I’m very excited about your next book's release! So sweet of you! Sorry to bother you. It’s OK. Dig in! What is it? This is Custard Apple. Where's the chilli? Ammu, you could have stayed in my place tonight. Your parents are not in town anyway. First think of convincing my parents. I won’t marry you without their consent. I think I should make an episode on them. Text me when you reach home. Bye. Bye. Oye! Bye. Our city has been in the spolight recently for its outrageously bad roads. What do you have to say about this issue? We have done our best, madam! What exactly have you done?! Did you know that there is just one well in our entire village? That is your fate! It’s not fate, it’s our great fortune! In this city, the roads are filled with wells. This is not the Capital of the State. This is the Capital of Potholes! No, wait. Capital of Road-Wells. I have heard enough of your nonsense. How dare YOU talk about bad roads? WHO built these roads in the first place? WHOSE party was in power then? Do you think people are so gullible? Hello, mister, all that foolery is by your party! Did you forget the fact that our party also covered up the potholes? Oh, yes, right. They spent one lakh Rupees to cover one pothole... And then, they buried our entire state in a bigger pothole! You and your corruption! What corruption are you talking about?! Do you have any proof of it? BARK IT OUT! BARK?! Talk properly! Don’t you have any manners? OK... OK, viewers, it’s time for a small break. Break!? Is that all? What an argument! Those punch lines! Wow! One lakh... One pothole... Very poetic! It’s all news channels’ influence. This great lady here taught me that line. I just delivered it. I also learnt my lines from them. But I have never been able to match your style of dialogue delivery! Is this an entertainment show? When you speak, it’s completely magical and thrilling. Why do you give a break just when I start talking? Why do you even invite us if you don’t want to hear our honest opinion? You shouldn’t have! Sir, don't worry. You will get a chance too. This guy is new. Doesn’t yet understand that he should yell only when it’s recording. Are we acting here? Politics. Nothing but theatrics. We, the ones who vote for them, should beat ourselves with our own slippers. Guruji! You seem to be lost in some thought. It’s just how it is. Our system, and its plight... I was just thinking about it. I was looking for you, Guruji. How come? I had a few questions for my next episode. Oh, the 100th episode! Let’s go. Guruji, what is this “BRAHMARAKSHASA”? In the Ulayi town of Bantwal, there is apparently a powerful BRAHMARAKSHASA inside a temple. And now it has been a year since the temple closed. I wanted to know more about it. Oh! So, you plan to help God get rid of a ghost in you 100th episode? I have known temples built for BRAHMARAKSHASAS. This case sounds peculiar - Ooh, “My first wife is dead and has become a ghost - - and is not allowing me to sleep with my second wife. Please come and solve this problem. Yours sincerely, 'Helpless' Naveen, from Mandya.” Poor guy, dude. If you can somehow help this 'Helpless' Naveen - - then he may be able to save his marriage. And man, it’s amazing how when the whole world communicates through mobile phones, Facebook or WhatsApp - - your viewers still write letters to you. That must feel great! Is it just these type of letters or do you get love letters too? These letters are all more about their fear of ghosts than their love for me. But then, that's what is peculiar about life. Love and fear go hand in hand. Hold on, hold on. Is this some kind of a ghost hunting philosophy? You can say that. You are mistaken, Sheelam. Where there is love, there is no fear. There is only concern. What are you saying, Guruji? People urinate and litter around in public without a care in the world. But when they see Gods' pictures on walls, they suddenly seem to care! When we see God’s pictures on the wall, it’s not love or concern that arises. It’s the fear of God's punishment that stops us. The fear of God is a good kind of fear. This fear is more dangerous, Guruji. It does not allow people to think and work. It makes them lazy. You are just whirling away from the topic, Sheelam. Oh, that's interesting! 'Whirling away' just like your Godly planets? Random and chaotic? Look, Sheelam, I don’t mind your taunts and wisecracks. However, - - mocking my beliefs - - and making fun of it, - - is something I really don’t like. If you feel my questions are making fun of your beliefs, - - then, does it not mean that you are not able to answer my questions? It is extremely stupid to say that you will accept something only after experiencing it. Oh, super point! But this is enough for now. Save some for later. Because 'Captain' has asked me to tell you that you will be the guests for our panel discussion tomorrow. I think this will be a good promotion for your 100th episode and also for your 3rd book. This is good! I'm impressed! Breaking news! 'Miss Loud Mouth' has finally used her brain! A huge round of applause, please! Just stop talking. Hold on! You can shut me up alright. Good luck with them on your show tomorrow! I predict there will be a huge fight. These two are really warmed up! You need not worry about that. 'Captain' will be moderating the panel. Excuse me, Guruji. Carry on. Hello. Hi. "Hey, so my workout will get over in an hour." OK OK! I have told my parents that I will be late. Shall we go out somewhere quiet? Your parents will disturb the 'quiet' with their calls anyway! Did you eat anything? Let me just call you back. Hello?! Rajeev. Good afternoon, sir. Rajeev! Why the hell do you even show up for work anymore?! Your ratings are the worst across all our channels in the country! Get some work done! Push those numbers up! Sir, the thing is - If you can’t do it, leave it to others. At least, get out gracefully. Do you understand? Look Rajeev, all we can do is give you one more cycle. If you cannot show results, then we’ll have to do what we have to do. We are also answerable to our bosses, man. I understand, sir. Thank you. Baby, please, cool. There are only two things that can help us now. Either our channel’s TRP ratings should increase - - or others’ TRP should decrease. Our ratings are definitely not going to increase with the kind of idiots working for us! Well, there could be another way out of this. If we can somehow get this guy on our side - - we can consider our job done. Shall I order anything else? No. That’s all. Touch any one of them. Hey, wait. You are supposed to hold out just two fingers. I like it when the number is higher. You pick one now! We will have four children - Two boys and two girls. Oh! Looks like you have made up your mind already! And what about this? We will live in a three-bedroom flat! Two honeymoon trips every year! One grand wedding! That’s only if my parents agree. Are they back in town? Yes. And just like I expected, marriage is the only thing they have been talking about. They have gone insane! Go easy on them. Their anxiety is understandable. Hello, it is not just them. I have also been super anxious! That job of yours and - Amrita, please. Let’s not talk about my job. Let’s talk about our honeymoon. I'm considering having the four kids at once and for that - Hey, Sheelam. Hi! Nice to see you here. In fact, - - I was going to give you a call tomorrow. I'm glad that we ran into each other like this. Let me come to the point. I need your show's 100th episode to be aired in my channel. I will pay you whatever you ask for. I will sign a five year contract with it. I will reschedule your show to the prime slot. Or else, you can even choose to work on some other kind of show. Yours is a risky job. How long will you work risking your life like this? Join our channel. I will give you whatever you want. I will even send security with you when you go out to record your show. In addition to that, you will have two slots to work with. Basically - - I need you in my channel! That’s it. Ask me whatever you need. Just let us eat in peace. That’s enough. OK. This is my card. You can call me anytime. Let’s go. Amrita! HEY! HEY! LOOK AT ME! COME HERE! LET ME OUT! PLEASE LISTEN TO ME! I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING! I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING! - LET ME OUT!! - Considering the nature of your job, I won't be surprised if you have earned a few enemies. - LISTEN TO ME! LOOK AT ME! - I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING! LET ME OUT! - Patil, shut that guy up! - LET ME OUT! COME HERE! - I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING! - Shut up you crazy man! - GET ME OUT OF HERE! LET ME OUT! - LET ME OUT! I DONT KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING! - I will get the security camera footage and inform you - - COME HERE! LET ME OUT! Stop screaming, you mad man! What is his problem! - I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING! LET ME OUT! You want to get beaten up? Shut up, crazy man! Once we have the footage, I will need you to come and see if you can identify anyone. Amrita! Dad?! What is this? What is going on here? Are you alright? Sir, it’s nothing - Please! You keep quiet. No one from our family ever had to step inside a police station till now! Dad, please! And you! Ruining our family's reputation by being with him! Let's leave right now! - Sir, please. - Dad, please listen to me! (SCREAMING CONTINUES) I'm sorry, sir. Just sit in the car! - Please listen to me, dad! - Get in, Amrita! Please understand, dad... Sheelam has done nothing wrong! Amrita, your bag. Call me after you get home! Oh my God! Lift him up! Come here, guys! Quickly! Careful! Hold him tightly! Back up more, quickly! Get him in before he bleeds to death! What a crazy man, sir! - Be careful! - Leave, leave. Take him to the hospital! So much blood! What a pain in the butt! That man was truly insane! Sir! I need speak with you, sir. I want a meeting with you. There is a problem. It is really important and it cannot wait! There is a problem, sir! OK, OK. Come later. There is no time, sir! I need to talk to you now! Please come later. Come on now, let’s go! Let me go! I just need five minutes, please! Sir, the panel discussion has started. OK, that’s enough. Let him go. - Sir, waiting! - Yeah, yeah, I’m coming. So, Guruji - - where according to you, does science and superstition meet? Or, do they meet at all? That is such a loaded question! My point is simple - Just like how science has - - clear answers to a lot of questions, - - there are a lot of other questions, - - for which science does not have answers at all! We must first admit that with humility. Guruji, that is the lat thing we should be doing. We must aggressively look for answers! Only then we will know the differences between Truth & Lies and Science & Superstition! If one looks up for answers without ego and personal prejudice, he will definitely find it. Our forefathers were not fools - - they had found more answers than us. Who are these forefathers, Captain? Forefathers... Who are they, Guruji? Let's not deviate from the topic by talking about forefathers now! Our forefathers lived in a different era! Science has made so much progress! The people are so much more aware! Aren’t we misleading them by telling such things? We are living in a different time, Guruji. Yes. But, times have changed but nature's constants have stood the test of time. We still breath the same air... We still drink the same water. I'm sure you all are aware of the Water-Cycle. It's not to different with air - Guruji, you are talking out of context, I feel. Let us avoid abstract philosophy! Let us stick to the point. Yes, Captain. Sheelam, what do you have to say about this? Is there any basis at all for any of the superstitions or blind-beliefs? You have made 99 episodes so far... Have you ever encountered anything close to supernatural? No, sir. Never! Man has always been the source of such rumours. And religious leaders like him only add fuel to these rumours. Don’t make generalised statements, Sheelam! Right, Guruji. Please tell me how to identify a true Guru from a false one? Is there some sort of certification? Someone spread a rumour saying that a building in an upscale locality was haunted. I shot an episode there and exposed the truth! Now, a software company is operating out of that building. Thousands of people walk in and out of there. Did the ghost just flee when it saw me? What's up with the silence, Guruji? Say something. It is stupid to believe every ghost rumour that goes around. Then who is to say that what you say is true? Who should certify? As someone who people look up to, you must strive to drive fear off their minds! But instead - OK OK, Captain. We have a caller on the line now. Hello, yes? Hello! Hello? My name is Mahantesh, I want to speak with Sheelam. Tell me Mahantesh, this is Sheelam speaking. Shame on you, you fraud! Do you think you are some kind of a TV hero? Have you looked at yourself in the mirror? You are cheating the public! You are an educated criminal! Can't defend yourself, can you? You criminal! Do you really go alone in search of ghosts? You don't really have what it takes, man! You just edit clips and show us lies! Are you not ashamed, you educated criminal - Mahantesh! Hello, Mahantesh? Hello! Hello? Sorry, viewers. The call got disconnected due to technical problems. (Panel Discussion Continues) "This discussion on God, faith, superstition will not get over in a day or two." (Panel Discussion Continues) "Let’s discuss this subject again next week." Call him back! Let it go, sir. These are all- Just do as I say! Call him! (Panel Discussion Continues) "So, that's it for today, viewers." (Panel Discussion Continues) "Up next, we have a story about a very naughty but foolish husband." Sheelam! Leave it. Wait, sir. Hello? Mahantesh? Mahantesh? Sheelam speaking. Hello, this is a public phone booth. Cut the call, please. Sir, I know who that guy is! Let it go, Sheelam. Come with me, come. What is this, sir?! You cannot be complaining about your feet getting wet when you are standing on a beach. Don't worry about all this, Sheelam. I am not worried, sir. I should have gotten a chance to answer him! I lost my face on live TV! It's not fair! Why did they have to cut the call? Let it go. Drop it. By the way, when is your next book releasing? Tomorrow, right? Yes, sir. Then go and make arrangements for that. Go. And Sheelam. What have you planned for the 100th episode? The promo needs to go on air soon! Yes, sir. I have got an interesting story. It is about a BRAHMARAKSHASA haunting a temple. BRAHMARAKSHASA? That's what they call - - the soul of a scholarly Brahmin who had a gruesome, unnatural death. "I was a little boy, -" "- A boy who waited for the yearly summer vacations. -" "- But I also knew of my mother's 'monthly vacations' -" "- During which she had to spend time in the cow shed, isolated. -" "- My grandmother, my aunt, my uncle's new wife -" "- All the women had to go to this 'house of pain' -" "- And when someone needed medicines to cope -" "- Wrong, outdated methods were used. -" "- Unexpected fluctuations in her body -" "- Made my mother bleed excessively that month. -" "- My grandfather did not trust doctors. -" "- He believed in black magicians. -" "- They made my mother scream so loud that the clouds cried. -" "- I wonder how she -" " - tolerated so much pain! -" "- That tender, little woman! -" "- When I heard her loud screams, -" "- I wouldn't know what to do! -" "- When she called me, smiling, -" "- I ran away, scared. -" "- My father couldn't bear to see her that way. -" "- He stepped out and went away. -" "- After four days, my mother's screams stopped. Forever. -" "- I want no one else in the world to be orphaned like me. -" "- Science must win over superstitions. -" "- This is The Reason driving my episodes and books. -" "- To light up all life -" Enough of your nonsense! Who is this fellow? Leave him! Let him go! Look at you sitting there on your high horse, all dressed up! I know your reality, man. You are a bloody cheater! You hear that? CHEATER! You think you are so cool hunting for ghosts and writing books about it! I will show you a house! There is a real ghost in it! Do you have the guts to come there and face something real? Damn you and your books! If you have a problem with me, talk to me personally. Don't create nuisance like this in public. Talk to you personally? You don't remember asking your security to kick me out when I came to meet you? You don't remember cutting my call? I dare you in front of everyone now! Come and prove that a ghost does not live in a house I show you! I don't want to engage with you! I won't come anywhere! Look at this! 'KAARANA' Sheelam is giving reasons! See for yourselves how this brave man is avoiding a real challenge! He is just a faker. Why are you avoiding it, sir? Take up the challenge! I have no need to do that! If you don't want to take up a real challenge thrown at you, does it not that mean everything you have done so far is fake? Give us a clear answer, sir. Is it just your show - - or is everything coming out of your channel fake? (REPORTERS' CHATTER) Stop it! Don't talk more than required! Hello mister, what do you want? Sir, I will show a house. He should prove that it is not haunted. OK. If the house you show is real - - then, that is where our 100th episode will be made! What is this, sir? Amrita! Let’s go from here. Don't worry, Sheelam. I know what I'm doing. Go ahead, click as much as you want! Trust me, Sheelam. This episode will create history in the TRP charts. I have no doubts about it. I have never seen or heard of this kind of publicity generted for any TV show. You are going to rock the charts. Trust me, Sheelam. Before he died, my father gave me the ownership of that house. I wanted to sell the house and invest in a business. Our family lawyer helped me a lot. He even got the sales papers ready. A prospective buyer came to see the house one day. I was showing him around. He slipped and fell from the second floor for no apparent reason. He died on the spot! After that, his people didn't want to buy the house anymore! Neighbors started spreading rumours about the house and scared away everyone! Nobody was interested in buying the house anymore! I consulted astrologers. One of them suggested me to repaint the house to get rid of the bad luck. I went to a different town and got a painter from there. He slipped and fell down from the ladder while painting. He died too! I wasn't able to make sense of what was happening! Another man came saying that he doesn’t believe in these things. He and his wife, they were alright. I saw it with my own eyes! They were just looking around the house when suddenly he started beating up his wife! He murdered her in cold-blood! “I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING! LET ME GO!” He is in jail now. Sir, where is this man now? Sir, he bled to death on the way to the hospital that night! Is this all you got? Yes, sir. People think that the house has also driven me crazy! I don't care what people say, sir, but there is no ghost in that house. The house is not haunted; but nobody believes me when I say it! I want you to say it, sir! People will believe it when you say it, sir. Put this shot in the end. Yes. Freeze this edit for the promo. Do it properly, man! There is great anticipation being built around your next episode, dude! Well, it is going to be my last one! WHAT?! Calm down! Come with me. What are you saying, dude? After this episode is done, - - I'm going to stop this show. You are joking! I'm not. Did you accept Rajeev's offer? Or, did someone offer you the lead role in a film? Nothing of that sort! Someone who loves me more than I love myself does not feel good about it. So, you are doing this for your girl? Are you sure about this, man? I'm aware of what I'm doing. Yes. I'm going to finish shooting this one first. And then give her a surprise. You don't go around telling people about this, OK? Siddesh sir! Boss wants to see you. OK. I'll be there. Oh, Guruji! I thought you were travelling to Kashi. I'm leaving tonight. Have a safe trip, Guruji. I thought your next episode was going to help reopen an abandoned temple - - but you have fallen prey to sensationalism! You are taking on an 'open challenge'! I have not let go of that idea, Guruji. My research on that is already complete. It'll probably be the next one. OK, Guruji, it’s getting late for the shoot. I’ll leave now. You are shooting today? Yes, Guruji. I'm doing it tonight. Cancel it. Why, Guruji? Tonight is an inauspicious one. I'm sorry, Guruji. I need to- I'm going to share something with you, guruji. What is it? Please don't tell anyone about it but I don't plan to continue with the show. What do you mean? I will tell you the details after you get back. But I cannot cancel the shooting of my last episode. See you, Guruji. Hello? I really don't want to talk with you. Just leave me alone, Sheelam. Hello, Amrita! Hey, Sheelam. What a blessed guy you are, man! TRP ratings drool all over you! What do you want now? I want the episode which you are going to shoot now! I will pay you whatever you want for it. Hey, don’t cut my call. Follow me! This is the house, isn't it? My brother has the house's spare keys. Somebody stole mine! Oh, Sheelam sir! Wow! Madam, they are here. Get in. I will not set foot inside the house. I hate my brother. I'll stay here. You and get the key. Please sit down. Would you like a cup of coffee? No, thank you. (CHANTING GOD'S NAME) No, thanks. This is The Lord Almighty's Prasada (Sacred Food). You shouldn’t say no. Be seated. I'll be right back. Here you go. I don't like strangers stepping inside the house my father built. But, he is the owner of that house now. Did you know that a woman was murdered there a few days back? I know about the crazy husband, yes, sir. Not just that sir, a fe- - I know, madam. A painter died there a few days before that. I really don't think that- Sujata! This man has made up his mind already! Otherwise, he would not have chosen an inauspicious night like this - - to come and ask us for the key. Let him be. You have come here to help us. For your intention, may the Lord Almighty bless you! I'll leave now. Just a minute. The living room's light switches are in the narrow space behind the TV stand. I'll keep that in mind. Sheelam! Sir! Sir! You forgot this. I know I can rely on you. You will get the job done. I know! I have faith in you. Go. I will wait for you here. I am relying on you. Understand. Please. (LOUD THUNDER) (LOUD THUNDER) Hello? Amrita! Amrita! Amrita! "The number you are calling is either -" "The number you are calling is -" Hello, Siddesh. Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go! - What's wrong! - Start the bike! Turn it around! Wait a minute... Wait! Amrita, listen to me! Don’t go inside! Sorry, he is no more. Amrita! Sheelam, after accepting an 'open challenge', has tragically died! Sheelam was found dead under mysterious circumstances. He was in the process of shooting 'KAARANA' - our channel's top rated show! Famous TV show host found dead! The exact cause of death remains a mystery! Was the house he went to truly haunted? On his 100th adventure, fate caught up with him! (VARIOUS NEWS CHANNELS REPORTING SHEELAM'S DEATH) *PHONE RINGING* Ravi, you are getting a call! *PHONE CONTINUES RINGING* Hello Tell me. Oh! Send me the location. (NEWS REPORTERS CHATTER) Move that side. Basavaraj, control the crowd! Good morning, sir. Hello, sir. Hello , sir! Good morning. Hi. Sir, the body has been shifted to the mortuary. The forensics team are here already. Do you see that female reporter standing there? Which one? Blue jeans and black top. Yes, sir. Is she new? I don't know, sir. If she asks for an interview with me, give her my personal number. OK? (mumbles indistinctively) Good morning, sir. Sir, just a second. Who arrived on the scene first? Sheelam's fiancé, Amrita and his colleague named Siddesh. I have sent Siddesh to wait in our station. Amrita lost her consciousness when she saw the body. She has been hospitalised, sir. She is out of danger now. Our lady constable is there with her, sir. Were there any injuries on the body? No, sir. Any unusual marks or blood? Nothing, sir. We will know more only after the post-mortem is done, sir. Kittappa! Sir. Found any fingerprints? A lot of them, sir. Nanda, make sure that no one from our department interacts with the press. OK, sir. Don't worry about it, sir. I'll take care of it. Sir - Why are you carrying this around? You are lucky that he has a sense of humour! OK, note down all the points I mentioned. Don't miss out on anything... - Why didn't you come meet me after work the other day? - How could I? My husband was right there! Did I disturb your vibe? Not at all, sir. No, sir. Sorry, sir. It's alright, I will come later. OK? Sorry, sir. Please continue! I insist! *tapping sounds from the bathroom* Nanda, I can't stress this enough. Please note down everything correctly. OK, sir. Whose house is this? The owner's name is Mahantesh, sir. But he seems to be missing, sir. What does that mean? Sir, there's another room here. Sir, that man has a strange reputation. Problems related to this house drove him crazy, apparently. He was there last night when Sheelam got here. And since then, his brother told me that he has not been found. His brother? Yes, sir. His house is right down the road. His name is Manjunatha Swamy. What if this missing person is hiding in his brother's place now? No, sir. We checked. Where is the brother now? He has gone to the temple, sir. Ask him to come to the office with that temple's 'prasada'. (Sacred food) Will do, sir. (mumbles indistinctively) (CROWD CHATTER) Look here, calm down! One moment! Sir, what exactly happened in there?! We have just started our investigation. How do you expect me to know exactly what happened already? How do you expect me to know exactly what happened already? Sir, at least tell us about the clues you have at this moment! Sir, at least tell us about the clues you have at this moment! (NEWS REPORTERS' QUESTIONS CONTINUE) Stand back, everyone! Step back! He was all set to make his 100th episode in that house! Sheelam's fiancé received a call from him early today morning. But by the time she got there... Baby, did you hear the news? A stranger had challenged him to do this episode recently during his book release function. This unfortunate incident happened when he went there. What is the use in crying now? This is because of the lenience we gave her! Now we must suffer! What caused the death of 'Kaarana' Shelam? Viewers, we have ACP Raviprakash Kaje on the line. Let us talk to him. Hello, Mr. Kaje. Tell me. We are calling from KA TV. What would you like to tell us about Sheelam's death? Right now, I would just like to do my job. OK? Thank you. It's not even been an hour since he died. These people are sitting on live panels and creating a sensation! Send me the forensics report the moment it comes. Yes, sir. Follow up with our lady constable in the hospital. Sir, these are all Sheelam's colleagues. Hello, sir. Excuse me, sir. What's happening? Nothing makes any sense to us! For now, even we are in the dark, Mr.? Prasad, Venkatesh Prasad. He is the channel head, sir. Oh, is it? Have a seat please. Inspector, what I am trying to tell is - These cameras were setup around the house, sir. Unfortunately, all the footage is password protected. But our cyber team is working on it as we speak. What is this? His personal diary? Am I allowed to read it? Why did the episode's location shift in the last minute? Sir - - What happened was - - On the day of - - the book release function - - a guy called Mahantesh had challenged him to take up a case. Sheelam had accepted it. Yes, sir. It got a lot of media coverage. So, a strange person throws a public challenge and the location shifts. Yes, sir. Before taking such decisions, don't you do any kind of background checks? Sir - - it was not his 1st episode. It was his 100th episode. We never expected any of this. That's right, you don't. You do anything for your TRP ratings. Now a life is lost! Who will take responsibility? OK, you can leave now. You will have to come whenever I call you. OK, sir. That friend of Sheelam's... Siddesh. Siddesh. Send him in. Yes, sir. Amrita!? Who is Amrita? Amrita. That's the one who came with you this morning, right? Sir, she didn't come with me. I came with her. Yes. Right. Did you see everything properly? I did, sir. These are the things which he would use daily. Nothing is standing out, sir. Sir. That guy Mahantesh was unemployed, it seems. He was trying really hard to sell that house. But he was not able to because of the rumours about that house. I asked you to call his brother, right? He is on the way, sir. Also, Amrita has been discharged from the hospital. I have seated her in front of your cabin. Want to see it again properly? Should I? I suggest you should. OK, sir. What are these things? What is they used for? Sir, should I explain the whole thing to you again now? Sit down, please. I am very sorry for your loss. I know this must be a very difficult time for you. But - I must ask you a few questions. You were the closest to him. How long did you know Sheelam for? Sir, sir! Wait! He is in a meeting. Don't go in. What do you want from me? You drag me out of my office in front of my employees! What does it mean?! Who are you? Sir, he is the business head of KA TV. So what if you are the business head? Who gave you the permission to enter my cabin? Look, sir. I can't ruin my channel's reputation just because someone died. Other channels are waiting outside just to cover the news of me being here. Look. A guy from your field is dead. Who said that he is in 'our field', sir? We work honestly in our field. We do not produce fake episodes like him and show off. He was finally forced to make a real one and he died. What can we do about that? Sheelam has never made any fake episodes, sir. He never worked for TRP like these guys. Just a few days back, this guy came to Sheelam and asked him to work for his channel, offering to double his salary. Now, he dares to speak like this! Maybe, you didn't like Sheelam for not accepting your offer - - and maybe, you got him murdered. No, no, no! I'm not the kind of guy who murders people. I just need numbers. Keep him seated here. I still have questions for you. This is Sheelam's diary, right? In spite of the many cameras recording all the information - - he also wrote down everything. Interesting, isn't it? He was an unusual guy, sir. He would make diary entries - - Write letters - - He would just wander off alone researching for his show - - He wouldn't eat anything outside, no matter what! - He was very particular about these things. A lot of people found him strange. But he was just that kind of a guy. So, Everything that's written in this diary is real and true? Sir. The camera footage has been recovered. OK. There she is. Things turned out to be truly inauspicious. He had told me that this was going to be his last episode - - But I never could have imagined this! What do you mean by 'last episode'? As far as I knew, he truly loved that show more than anything else. But I realised that's not the case - - He loved you more than he ever loved that show. He had decided to stop the show. He wanted to give you a surprise! But then... Play it in a faster speed. There is absolutely no connection between what we are seeing and what's written in this! Here! Hope you can find something in this! "I hear the sea roar when I open the window." What's this, sir? How did he hear the sea in this city? How do you think his mental condition was? Was he normal? - Morning, sir. - Good morning, sir. Amrita! Amrita? Amrita. Amrita. *somebody whistling a melody* *whistling continues* Sheelam! Amrita! Sheelam! Amrita! Amrita... Let me go! Get off me! Let her go! Let me go! Hey, don't! Hey! Hey! Sheelam! Amrita! Hey, stop! You never cared about what I said. I'm sorry, Sheelam. I had no other choice. What's happening...? You won't understand anything now. Go to sleep... My husband has no peace of mind because of that Mahantesh. All of our relatives - - think that Manjunatha Swamy does not take care of his brother. We have tried to get him on the right track several times, sir! But he just won't listen! Look at how we are suffering now! The little hope we had for a peaceful life is also gone!. He has ruined it all! Oh, Lord Almighty! I had adviced him to perform a Sacred Ritual in that house to ward off evil spirits. He did not listen. He sought the help of a TV guy instead! He just wants to prove at any cost that there is nothing wrong with the house. So much greed for money! God will definitely punish our family for all this. Who built that house? Our father, sir. But now, it belongs to my brother. Where is your brother now? My brother has become a nomad of sorts. I have no idea! Only the Lord Almighty knows! File all the reports properly. OK, sir. Another young guy! Who is he? No idea, sir. A 'John Doe'. It's an accident case. OK, shift him in. Yes, sir. Be careful, guys! Sorry, sir. Is he not that TV show host? Yes, sir. Sheelam! Oh God, this pain! Sheelam. Oh, God! Amrita! Sit, sit! Sit down. I can't take it anymore! Call the doctor. Call the doctor, please! Doctor. Doctor. Doctor! I- Let me - I will be right back! *a newborn baby crying* He is beautiful, isn't he? Everything is going to be alright, Sheelam. Papa! Pick me up, papa! Papa! Please pick me up! Pick me up, papa! Papa! Pick me up, papa! Papa! Papa, hold me! Pick me up, papa. Pick me up, papa! Please, papa! Papa! Papa, pick me up! Papa! PAPA! PICK ME UP, PAPA!! Amrita! Amrita! Amrita! Sir. My name is Muni. That's a really small name! Full name is Vajramuni, sir. Tell me what happened last night, Vajramuni? Last night - - I was thrilled when Sheelam sir came home. I had only seen him on TV. I have watche- Cut the backstory, man! Just give me a good narration of last night's scene. Come on! Actually, Mahantesh brought Sheelam sir home. Manjunath Swamy was in the middle of his special evening prayers. It was I who invited Sheelam sir to come inside the house. It was a great moment! After the prayers, Manjunath Swamy gave the 'Prasada (Sacred Food)' to everyone. And then - Manjunath Swamy tried a lot to stop Sheelam sir from going inside that wretched house! Sheelam sir did not listen. Then, we offered him dinner. Sheelam sir said no. He took the house's key and left. Mahantesh was sitting outside till then - - Even left with Sheelam sir. And after that... That's all, sir! Sir, you have a call. Hello. I have an update for you. Sheelam is not dead, sir. He is alive. What?! Yes, sir. It was a misdiagnosis by the doctor who was on the spot. He was wrongly declared dead. What do you mean?! This is a major embarrassment for us, sir. We are looking into it. But, I suspect - - that it could have been a drug-induced cardiac arrest! OK. "He wouldn't eat anything outside, no matter what!" "After the prayers, Manjunath Swamy gave the 'Prasada (Sacred Food)' to everyone." Did Manjunath Swamy give the Prasada (Sacred Food) to Sheelam also? Yes, sir. He gave it to all of us. Sheelam sir said no to it but then - This is The Lord Almighty's Prasada (Sacred Food). You shouldn’t say no. Sir. I did not do it on purpose. I had no intention of killing anyone! My father loved his younger son more than me! That's why - - a few before he died, - - he transferred the ownership of that big house to Mahantesh. And to a married man like me, he gave the small house! An unemployed, spoilt brat gets the big house! I had to find a way - - of getting that house's ownership. My wife adamant about it. I didn't agree. I said no. She got really upset with me. She even stopped sleeping with me, sir! One day, my brother suddenly decided to sell that house. We had to stop that from happening. Time was running out! If we prove that Mahantesh was mentally unstable - - we would automatically become the guardians of the house, my wife said. Both of us hatched a plan together. It paid off! Anyone who came to see that house - - started behaving strangely. Mahantesh too, - - as the days passed - - started going insane! What was your plan? What was your plan, I asked! L. S. D. L. S. D? Yes. When it enters your body... It feels like you are floating higher than a building! It's as if you are swimming in the sea... Everything looks unearthly! Many strange people come and meet you! But... But, I never imagined that it could kill! I had no intension of killing people, sir! "An exciting twist to the tale of the TV host!" "Sheelam is not dead! He is alive!" "BREAKING NEWS - Doctors' negligence, policemen's nightmare!" "Sheelam is alive!" "Reports are coming in 'Kaarana' Sheelam is still alive!" "Popular TV host is alive!" "In a dramatic twit to the tale, Sheelam is not dead!!" The MRI scans are fine. Coming to the Toxicology Report - - You are right. It is a drug. See. Lysergic acid diethylamide. L. S. D. I have handled a lot of such cases when I have raided rave parties - - But, this is probably the strangest! Normally, in all these parties, people might end up with a dosage of 20-30mg. But in Sheelam's case, there was 1000mg. Thousand!? It was an extreme overdose. So, what exactly happened in this case, doctor? 'Lazarus Phenomenon.' Patients who are pronounced dead after a cardiac arrest can 'come back' sometimes. There may have been fewer than 30 cases in the last 30 years. It's a very rare occurrence. Sheelam had a cardiac arrest because of the drug overdose. When he did not respond multiple CPRs, he was declared dead. This is where our doctors should have been more cautious. Sir, why had Sheelam written such bizzare things in his diary? The human mind is a wonderfully complicated thing. To intensify the thoughts looming over the sub-conscious mind, - - is one of LSD's main effects. Don't stress yourself. He'll be absolutely fine! Thank you, sir. I had to cross death itself to complete my 100th episode. "It is extremely stupid to say that you will accept something only after experiencing it." "Tonight is an inauspicious one." "This is The Lord Almighty's Prasada (Sacred Food). You shouldn’t say no." You will get the job done. I know. I will wait for you here. It was Mahantesh who had an overdose of LSD. Thanks to the hospital's negligence, everyone thought that I had overdosed. But then - What exactly happened to me there? What exactly did I see there? I made 99 episodes looking for ghosts outside. Did I end up finding something inside me in this 100th one? This makes me relook everything I have seen so far... Now, I only have questions.
