Look, can you just have a look at my car please? I don't know what's wrong with it. It just keeps stalling. I don't know what's going on and I really need to get going, please. But is he okay? BLONDE: Can you please just look at my bloody car! Just have a look at my car! MECHANIC: Is he okay? Is he okay? Please, just tell what's wrong with it. It won't work! I'm in a real hurry. I've got to go, I can't hang about. Please. Alright, I'll see what I can do. Please. (PHONE BUZZING) Julie. Is Max safe? Is he okay? Oh my God. What? What the skull? Well he went under again for the skull? But that's what has to be destroyed. Well yeah, he wouldn't be able to brink again, you can only do it once. Those are the rules. Oh my God. Well if Max is gone that means we're next. Look, can you please hurry up, I really need to go. I think you've got problem with your spark plugs and it seems to be misfiring. What kind of stuff are you mixed up in? It's nothing anyone can do now. No one can help us. (OMINOUS MUSIC) (MALE GASPING) No. No, no, no, no! Nikki. Nikki! Nikki get me out! Get me out Nikki! Okay, I just need to go in the office and check what parts and bits I've got. Nikki, wake me up! Okay? Be back, and it might take some time. You're back. Oh it's so lovely to see you again sweetheart. I need to wake up. I can't, I can't stay here. Your soul belongs to him now son. You gave it to him when you passed over. It's his now. Surrender to him. Mom, no. No, I wanted to see you. I'm not ready, I'm not ready to die yet. That's not your decision anymore. We all have to surrender at some point. Now is your time. (MALE GRUNTING) Welcome to the dark side. (BLOOD SPLASHING) No. No. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no! No! No please! Please! Ambulance please. Baby, baby, baby, please wake up! Please wake up! Please don't leave me! WOMAN: I can see he's bleeding. (BLONDE SOBBING) Please don't. I need you. My God. No. Oh my God. You have to help me please! Help! Please! Please! (OMINOUS MUSIC) I don't know what they're on but you need to get down here. She's stabbed herself! You better get down here now! (NIKKI GASPING) I don't wanna go to the other side. (HIGH PITCHED RINGING) (NIKKI GASPING) No. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (NIKKI SCREAMING) I just think that maybe if your grades can't improve and you can't find a way of juggling your home life and your university life, then just maybe it would be worth taking a gap year. Like your brother. Nursing isn't something you can just fly by. You're gonna need to get decent grades in order to work in a decent hospital. You shouldn't see it as a negative. Some people just need to recharge and refocus. Honestly, I don't think a year out would help me. Your brother, I spoke to him a little while back and he seems to think it's done him the world of good since your mother... Professor, my brother's not coming back. What do you mean he's not coming back? My brother, since my moms passing he's, he's not been himself. He's not the same anymore. Well he's quite the dare devil from what I've seen online. That's not the worst part. What you saw online, those stints, to become famous or whatever he's doing it for, it's a reaction to the situation. Since moms passing, he's kind of lost control. Look, listen to me okay. You're not alone on this. No one is ever alone really. Unless they make themselves. You can be helped if you want people to help you. You and your brother. I know, I get it. I screwed up my grades this year. I'm not taking a gap year. This is the only thing that's keeping me sane. It's the only thing giving me structure. I've got to continue the year and just sort my life out. Well if it ever gets too hard, then just... It won't. It won't get too hard. (LIGHT GENTLE MUSIC) Anything important? Just something for mom. It's trash. How was college? It was fine. How was your day? Yeah, great actually. Went over the 50K mark with my viewers on a new post. Wanna see? Sure. Drink? At four p.m. No then? Suit yourself. I'm good thanks. BROTHER: Hey watch this. Where is this? Alright, look. Why you always got to shun my parade huh? What are you actually doing? Making something of myself Lil, that's what. By climbing to the top of some insanely tall building with no protection, drinking at four p.m. and flunking college? Yeah, making something of yourself. Sure, great. Why are you so quick to judge huh? I'm trying alright. Well try a little harder. You know, it'd be nice to receive just an ounce of support sometime. Alright great, just walk away then, great. I'll see you at breakfast then Lil. Or even the same time, same place tomorrow yeah? (LIGHT GENTLE MUSIC) (MUFFLED SPEAKING) (FLOOR CREAKING) I read up about it. Everything's gonna be okay. We got each others backs alright. We do this and if it works, it works. If it doesn't then, worse case we get woken up. You think this girl would do it for us? You think she'll be there if anything go wrong? BRUNETTE: Where is she? BROTHER: Thing is, she, one of us might have to do it. Do what? Oh, you're awake. I thought you'd be asleep or something. Who are these people? Go to your room. That's it, come on. Explain, now. I tried to before. I was going to before, but you just stormed off over the sight of me climbing a god damn building! Answer me, who are those people? Look. I met them online okay. They saw my videos and said they had this idea. Crazy idea but a cool idea. What kind of idea? You're gonna freak out. Just tell me. Francis lost his girlfriend in a terrible car crash. He was the driver. It was a total accident. But he prays every day that he could say sorry to her. And Francis is? He's the guy in there. What's that got to do with you? He wants to see her again. As does Zara, the girl in there. She wants to be reconnected with her brother who she lost when they were little. Where are you going with this? What? You wanna play with some Ouija board or something? Jeff you've lost me. Francis found this thing online. This ritual that means you can cross over into the afterlife. And if you completely let yourself cross over then you can potentially speak to those who've passed on. Jeff, you've completely lost me. Letting yourself cross over, what are you talking about? It's called Brinking. People have done it before and they say it works. You wanna see mom? I wanna do it for my channel. I wanna film the whole thing and then post it. Sorry. Have you taken something? What is it? What are you taking? Because only a drugged up lunatic would say something like this. Jesus Jeff! Listen alright, I thought it would be a cool experiment. Something that might get a lot of views. I wanted to ask you. Ask you if you'd be there because you do nursing and stuff. Just in case anything goes wrong. If something does go wrong, you'd be the best person to have around because of your experience. Goes wrong how? It's the way you actually do it. You got to let yourself bring death. We figured a way of doing it. If you suffocate yourself, let your body go and lose consciousness, then you can actually brink onto the other side. So you guys actually want to kill yourselves for this experiment? Jeff, I'm not a doctor, I'm a training nurse. Well technically we're not actually killing ourselves. Because if we come back, we brink death. But technically you are. You are actually killing yourselves and reviving your bodies. That's not why we're doing it. We're not getting into this full steam ahead without no research. Jeff, this is crazy. And you're considering actually filming them. You'll go to jail. I'm not considering filming them. I'll be doing it with them. You're kidding me. Then do it for me. Do it for me, do it for us. 'Cause if you don't, we're just gonna do it anyway. With or without you. We leave in the morning. (BIRDS CHIRPING) Doing the coffee? I thought you threw the towel in with that stuff eh? Make me one. (BROTHER CHUCKLES) Yeah I'm gonna need it today. Camera, check. Sound equipment, check. Diva light, check. What's a diva light? I saw some trashy girls online using it. They said it was the most complimentary type of lighting. You wanna look sexy when you die? Why the hell not? Look, I'm not just doing this for my channel alright. There is a chance I could see mom. Say goodbye. Properly goodbye her. It's a risk worth taking. Alright, thank you for being there. You supporting me means a lot. Alright. Come on, let's get going. We've only got the church for a few hours. We got until noon to get up out of here. You think I wanna risk getting caught? Stuff already in the back room? I got it all set up bro. I got a key to lock it up. We can fix it later on. What stuff? We got to make a show of it ain't we? (EERIE MUSIC) (GATE CREAKING) It's so pretty in here. You'll soon get bored. You see it every day. Come on this way. Hey guys, Jeff here, daredevil genius. We have a wild one. Something that I've never done before. Well, especially not as dangerous before. It is close to the wire guys. And everything you're about to see today is completely and utterly real. Now we all take responsibility and full consent for what we're about to do because it is pretty fucked up. So we all take responsibility. Am I right? Yeah. I take full responsibility for my actions today. That's right. I'm here because I wanna be. Ain't nobody forcing me to be here. In today's video, we will be Brinking. A legend that goes, and if you say this ritual and focus on your loved one, completely focus your mind on that loved one, then it is said that it will bring them forward. And then if you let your body pass on, then you will be able to connect with them. But fear not, we do not intend on staying dead. An unknown helper will resuscitate us after three minutes. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, we do not advise trying this at home. We ready? You ready? What have I got to do? It's simple. You watch the timer. And after three minutes, wake us up. Okay. Let's make history. (BIRDS CHIRPING) (DOG BARKING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (GROUP OF THREE) For the powers that see, for the powers that be, let them be present, and let us cross over in peace, and return in the life. For the powers that see, for the powers that be, let them be present, and let us cross over in peace, and return in light. Okay. Now think of your little brother and speak the last memory you have of him. And when you're ready, we'll begin. My little brother Issac. He was 10-years-old when he left this world. We snuck out of the house. Dad had no idea. We went to a nearby construction site. We were running around and we heard a police car. We thought we'd get caught. Both of us running as fast as we could. That was the last time I saw him. I had no idea what happened. That he'd hit his head on the scaffolding. I left him. Maybe if I'd stayed he'd still be with us today. But I didn't notice. I just ran. Isaac. I'm coming for you now. You're not alone. (HEART BEATING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (ZARA GASPING) Grab her arms. What are you doing! JEFF: Grab her arms. When she stops moving What are you doing! JEFF: Start the timer. (LOUD RUMBLING) (ZARA GASPING) JEFF: Start the timer. Is she dead? Start the timer. Do it now Lily! Come on. Come on, we got to get moving. Man. Man I'm sure. You don't have to do this. No. I wanna do it. I wanna. Say your memory. Let's get this over with. My girl Amy, I remember the way she smelled that night. It was our anniversary. A drunk man, just came out of nowhere. I never reacted in time. I'm ready Jeff. Let's do this. Let's do it. (HEART BEATING) (HEAVY BREATHING) (LOUD RUMBLING) Amy. Amy Amy. Amy. We got to get going. It's my turn. I'm gonna need your help. What? What do you mean? JEFF: I need you to hold me down. LILY: What? It'll be my natural instinct to try to break free. I need you to hold me down. I won't do that. Don't let me down. Jeff. The last time I saw you mom, is when you left the house that day. If I'd of known anything would have happened to you, I would of never let you go. I wish I could say goodbye to you. Tell you how much you mean to me. I'm sorry I'm such a fuck up. I wanna make things right. I wanna make this all right. I miss you mom. Lily, do it. Do it Lily! Lily do it. Do it! (OMINOUS MUSIC) (HEAVY BREATHING) Jeff, Jeff no! (LILY SOBBING) No! No Jeff! No, no Jeff! No! No Jeff! No! No! No! No! (JEFF GASPING) Oh God. (TIMER TICKING) (CAT MEOWING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) Isaac? Isaac are you here? Are you here? Boo! Did I scare you? FRANCIS: Amy? Amy. You're here. Amy. Is that you? It's me Francis. I can't... I can't believe it's actually you. I can't believe. I can't believe you're standing here right in front of me. I can't believe it. (WOMAN HUMMING) Mom? (HEAVY BREATHING) Oh God. Who are you? Isaac it's me. Zara. No. Zara's my sister. A little girl, like me. She grew up Isaac. Whilst you were gone I grew up. I'm your sister Zara. You're Zara. Yes. You're really pretty. Oh Issac, I've missed you so much. Mom? Jeff. Mom? Mom I'm so sorry I never go to say goodbye to you. That I never to say how truly amazing you are. I miss you mom. We both do. Me and Lily. I miss you both too. I love you Jeff. I love you too mom. You missed my birthday. I've been alone here. Alone on my birthday for a while now. I'm here. I'm here with you now mom. For good? I can stay a while. Then I have to leave. Leave? No. You're here now. So you stay. The reason I'm here is because I have to let you go. I have to say goodbye properly. I'm not going anywhere. You can't leave me again. Not now. (TIMER TICKING) It's always dark here. You haven't seen grandpa? I'm always alone. The darkness. Are you staying with me? Oh Isaac I wish I was. One day I will. One day I'll be here with you and I won't go anywhere. One day? Yes, one day. But until that one day, I'll be alone. You're never alone. (ISAAC GASPS) Ow! My head hurts. What do you mean? You left me. You left me while my head hurt. It's not like that. It hurts all the time. (TIMER TICKING) (HEAVY BREATHING) Zara. Okay, okay, okay. Two, three, four, five. Where does it hurt? Here. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. You're not going anywhere sister. He has your soul just like he has mine.

(ZARA GASPING) Are you okay? Are you okay? Yeah? Francis, Francis! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. (FRANCIS GRUNTING) Nine, 10. Francis, can you hear me? It's Lily. Francis! (FRANCIS GRUNTING) One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. (AMY GROWLING) Francis! Francis!

FRANCIS: Come on man, breathe! That's right, that's right man. Breathe, breathe. Breathe. That's right man, breathe. Breathe man. (ZARA SOBBING) ZARA: Oh Jeff. FRANCIS: Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. It worked! FRANCIS: That's right man. It worked. FRANCIS: It worked man, it worked. Are you sure it was mom? She was different like, there was something different about her. It was mom. I'm sure as hell it was mom. She was in this space. A dark space right? Abyss of nothing. Just a dark dimension. Other worldly like. We all went to the same place then. We must have, just different areas. Areas or maybe time doesn't exist. I have no idea what that place was. The ritual, the words we said. I think that brought them forward and we brought them in the middle. You mean like some kind of mid-dimension? Some kind of place between the living and the dead. I mean I guess so. Before I left the world, before I left Amy, it was like, it wasn't her. Something happened in that dimension. What do you mean? What happened? Before I woke up, she just snapped. She started to bite me. Everything about that felt real. She started to bite into my neck. And now I got a mark. Look. What the hell is that? Look, you probably caught yourself waking up or something, come on. I had something similar too. Go on. Why do you got to support the negatives all the time? Zara, what did you see? This thing appeared before I left the world. A thing? Isaac, he vanished and this thing stood before me. Not wanting me to leave that dimension. Wanting to keep me dead. And what'd it look like? It wasn't human. Whatever it was it wasn't human. It was this thing, this monster! It had the face of a monster... Stop. Honestly, stop. You saw it too didn't you? Answer me! You saw it too right? I'm not going crazy am I? Whatever happens on the way out of that place was probably our brains getting mixed up in the moment. We were dead. We physically died in that moment in time. Sure as hell our brains are gonna play tricks on us. You think your girlfriend took a bite out of your neck? It was probably the girls being rough handed with you when they woke you up. And you think you saw a monster? I mean come on! Stop over-analyzing shit. Enjoy that we got to see those who had passed on. Enjoy and feel lucky that we got to say goodbye to them. Jesus. I'm going to bed. (OMINOUS MUSIC) How the hell did you get in here? Hey, can I come in? Sure. Going to bed soon. We'll just have a chat before bed. You doing okay? Fine. Yeah. What was it like, seeing mom? You think I'm crazy. No I don't. I believe you believe you saw her. She was real. She was sitting right there in front of me. What happened? What did she say? She was exactly how I remembered her the day she died. She wore the same clothing, the same tone in her voice. It was, it was mom. I just can't believe it actually worked. Like it actually worked. I got to say goodbye to mom. I got one last moment with her. ♪ The bell tolls ♪ ♪ With the reapers glory ♪ ♪ What you seen in life ♪ ♪ You couldn't read in story ♪ ♪ You reap the glory ♪ ♪ I've seen the story ♪ ♪ Now you dealt all night ♪ Hello?

I couldn't sleep. What happened? You're gonna think I'm crazy. Come on, tell me. I saw Isaac. I know it sounds out of this world and in ways it is. But I actually saw him dad. What do you mean? We did this experiment. Talked to the dead. But it actually worked. (FLOOR CREAKING) Oh my God. Oh my God he's here. Dad, he's right behind you, look. What on earth is the matter with you Zara? Isaac's here! DAD: Zara, you're scaring me. Dad, he was right behind you! You have the cupcake I gave you. I missed you. I missed you too. (OMINOUS MUSIC) (ZARA SCREAMING) What the hell's going on Zara? (DOOR BANGING) I'm not crazy, he was right there! It was like I brought him back from the dead with me! It was too real! Exactly how it felt like when I was Brinking! What, do you think he came back with you? Honestly, I don't know. But something doesn't feel right. This isn't right, what we did! I think you're just paranoid. You've been dreaming of this day for so long and finally it happens, your brain is playing tricks on you Zara. Don't read into it. Look, go home, get a good nights sleep. You've been through a lot. I mean we basically died today. This isn't my brain playing tricks with me Jeff, this is real! Lily, you're a nurse! Come on, tell me, what do you think? I don't know what to think. Maybe he's right. Just get some sleep and see what happens tomorrow. See how you feel. I don't want to go home alone. I'm scared. And I saw it again. Saw what? That thing! That monster from the other side! It was right there! It stood before me! Please tell me I'm not the only one and I'm not crazy! What do I do? Look, I'll make a bed up, you can stay here. Would you mind? No of course not, sleep here. Zara, I think she's asleep. She seems better. What are you doing up so late? I'm just finishing off some editing. Jeff. You got to put off uploading that anywhere. No, no, no, come on. Screw that. This was one of the reasons why we did it. Come on. You wanna see it?

You just said you thought she was seeing things? What? Have you seen things Francis? Tell us. Something ain't right. I wasn't gonna say anything, but... Amy, I think I brought her back. What do you mean? I heard her voice man. When I was at work. It felt so real. (CAT MEOWING) LILY: Jeff, have you experienced anything? Nothing. Jeff. You got a minute? Yeah. I got to show you something. JEFF: What is this? You a detective now or something? They did it, three years ago. They did what you did. Brinking. Right. Now they're all dead. Not one of them stands this day. Neil Chambers, he set himself on fire four days after the experiment. Sasha Fletcher, she was last seen talking to herself and she jumped off a building claiming he was after her. The Grim Reaper. All four of them were friends. Daryl Jones, Nikki Mitchell, they were found dead at a gas station. And the mystery was how Daryl got stabbed with no attacker. And Nikki stabbed herself in the gas station. What is your point? They did what you did. It's been done before. And there was always someone chasing them. They felt like death was following them. They all died the week after Brinking. Just like Zara. You're crazy. I may be. But I'd rather be safe than sorry. (SPEAKER GROWLING) AMY: Francis. Amy. Amy. (AMY GIGGLING) Amy. (WOMAN GASPING) Are you coming back? Hi, May Frake? Can I help you? Amy. Aren't you coming back? I'm so sorry for what happened to you. I just wanted to say goodbye to you. But once you leave this world, you cannot return. You need to go. You need to be at peace.

(OMINOUS MUSIC) (AMY LAUGHING) (GLASS SHATTERING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) I was wondering if you could tell me what happened. The girl, Nikki. She was crazy. She came in here saying it was after them. Convinced someone stood before her. What? Who did she see? I have no idea. But she was panicked. Terrified for her life before she did it. Did it to herself. Did you really think it was suicide? No. Something was there. Something did that to her. Something not from this world. She said you had to cross over to stop it. Find the skull. But it was a bit gibberish what she spoke. (OMINOUS MUSIC) (HEAVY BREATHING) (PHONE RINGING) Francis? Jeff. It's not them. It's not them dude. It's not them. Look Francis, what do you mean it wasn't them? It's not our loved ones.

The car garage lady just told me that, she said Nikki, she said the Reaper was after her. And she also said about the skull. And online it said that the skull was from a God, stolen from a God Orcus. It said the skull was a portal to the other world. We need to go back there. I got to go back to where it all began. The graveyard. JEFF: Francis is already dead. Does this mean... Don't. Stop. Stop. We can win this. We can win this okay. We just got to go to the other world. We got to stop him. We get the skull and destroy it. It's the only way he can get us under and kill us on the other side. Meet me at the graveyard. He'll be coming for you. To bring you back to me. LILY: Jeff, hurry up! What are we doing here? You're gonna put me under. I can stop this. What? You're gonna put me under. The lady said that's what they did. You got to destroy the skull. That's the way to break the curse. How do you know all this? I just know we had to do something. Online it said you go under to stop it and they said, the other victims, they wanted to go under but I guess they didn't have anyone to go under for them. But you have me. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You are not doing this. What if it goes wrong and it comes after you? Jeff, I'm not losing you! Lily... You have to put me under! Please, no! Listen to me, put me under. Do this for me, not you! For the powers that see, for the powers that be, let them be present and let us cross over in peace and return in light. By the powers that see, by the powers that be, let them be present and let us cross over in peace and return in light. (OMINOUS MUSIC) JEFF: It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. (HEART BEATING) I'm sorry. (TIMER TICKING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) Hello. Hello? Zara. Zara. Zara. (ZARA SOBBING) It's alright. (FRANCIS SPEAKING GIBBERISH) (LILY SCREAMING) (WOMAN HUMMING) You're not my mom. You came to see me too? Ready to join your brother? (TIMER TICKING) (CAT MEOWING) Go away. Stop fucking with my head! Get away from her. Get away from her! (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Lily, Lily, Lily come on! Lily you got to wake up! Lily come on! You got to wake up Lily! Come on! You got to wake up Lily, come on, come on. Come on Lily. You're not my mom. I'm not? Give me the skull. You've come for this? Give it to me. No, no, no, not yours. LILY: Give it to me. You left me to die Lily. You let me out of that house that day without a care in the world. You knew I'd been drinking. You saw me. Stop it. You saw me downing those drinks that morning. Now what kind of daughter does that make you? You're not my mom. I look like her though don't I? Where is she? Where's my mom? Burning in fucking hell. She says hello. She is looking forward to seeing you. (OMINOUS MUSIC) Come on! Wake up, wake up. Wake up Lily! Wake up. Get away from me! Get away from me. You and your brother, murderers. But then again, ain't no one want children like you two. Disgusting and worthless. What makes you even more pathetic is that you knew exactly what you saw that morning. You let her drive herself to work even after she asked you for a lift. Couldn't tell your brother that though, could ya? Too ashamed huh? Let mom go off, off her face to work knowing this. You wanted her dead. Is that why you didn't bring yourself the first time? Scared to come face-to-face with the mess you created? Please stop! Mommy killer. You really can't wait to see her face huh! (LILY SCREAMS) (JEFF GRUNTS) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (LOUD THUDDING) Lily no! Lily, it's me! It's me! It's mom! It's me. I forgive you. I never blamed you. I knew it wasn't your fault! I should've stayed home that day. I shouldn't have relied on you with a life. That's why you took up nursing right? To heal it wasn't pain. (MOTHER GROWLING) (LILY SCREAMING) (HEAVY BREATHING) Lily. Lily. No. (LOUD CRACKING) (JEFF GRUNTING) No, no, no! (SKULL SHATTERING) (LOW RUMBLING) Jeff. Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, wake me up! Wake me up Jeff. Wake me up! Wake me up Jeff! (TIMER TICKING) Hey Lil. What are you doing here? I'm sorry I was such a fuck up. I love you though. I always will. Jeff, what are you saying? (LILY GASPING) Jeff, Jeff. Jeff! Jeff, Jeff! Jeff, Jeff! Jeff, Jeff! Jeff come on! Come on Jeff! Jeff! (HEAVY BREATHING) Come on Jeff, please. Please, please, please! Please wake up! Please wake up! Please! (LILY SOBBING) Please wake up! Please. Please wake. (JEFF GASPING) Jeff! Oh my God. Who said you can't cheat death twice? LILY: I love you so much. I love you too. I'm gonna need a hospital. (CAT MEOWING) (CHILLING MUSIC)
