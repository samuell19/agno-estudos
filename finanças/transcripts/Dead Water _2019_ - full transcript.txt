All right, thanks, man. Thanks for doing this. It's gonna be fun. Thank you. He was 14 inches from me in this tent, trying to bang this chick, when all of the sudden the roof opens up and rain starts pouring in. He jumped up buck naked and ran to his truck, grabbed a tarp, threw it over, and got right back to business. You know what he said to me? "You should have brought a raincoat." Best friend I ever had. To Danny, best damn Marine I ever knew... present company included. Fuck off. - So when do you go back? - I'm not. As of last week, I'm officially out of the court. I always pegged you as a in-it-for-life kind of guy. Well it wasn't my choice. What, did they slap a medal on you and decide you're a better showpiece than a soldier? Oh, fuck the medals. It don't bring back the guys we lost no matter how much you polish them. I had enough. It was time. Well... I guess Viv is happy you guys are gonna get to spend some quality time together. Oorah! On the house. Why? I can't have you buy drinks after all you did over there. After all I did? I was just doing my job just like you should be doing yours, here. Hey, relax man. I'm just trying to show a little respect. Show some respect and take the money. You got it. I'm sick of that man. What, free drinks? I'll take them all day long. False appreciation, hiding behind the flag... It's bullshit. I just... want to get back to some normalcy. I just wanna get... back to my life. How is Viv handling all of this? It's an adjustment. I've had a lot on my mind lately but she's good. So have you guys gotten back to business? What do you mean? You know, working on a little mini Coop? It's none of your goddamn business, but yes. Yeah. A lot? Yeah. A lot. A lot. Police said at the early hours of March 22nd, two owners were found dead here this morning. That chick needs to show me her tits. Right. The neighbors heard a loud noise. The suspects are still at large. Don't even pay attention to 'em, Coop. C'mon. Coop. She needs to do a report on my balls. Hey, guys. I'm a pretty nice dude which is why I'm gonna give you a chance to take back what you just said. What the fuck is he-- what are you talking about? I'm saying you can eat your words or you can eat this bar. That's my wife. Oh, that can't be your wife anymore man, that Jack's girl. Maybe if she's with this guy I got a chance. C'mon, Coop. I don't give a shit if you are a war hero, this is my bar, get out. Just go. Get out of here. Come on. Guess those medals are worth something. They're gonna look the other way this time. Last thing they want to do is answer questions about a decorated marine being arrested for defending his wife's honor. Maybe you should talk to somebody about whatever it is that you're going through. If not for you, then at least do it for Vivian. Let's go. I bought a yacht. You bought a yacht? Got to go pick it up down in the Virgin Islands over the holiday weekend. Why don't you and Vivian join me? To the Virgin Islands? Yeah, why not? I mean, a couple days on the open water, breathing that fresh salt air. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Big guy, I mean-- Yes, Viv loves the water. Yeah, she does, yeah! And then you'll be a hero, to her for once. I mean if it's God and country all the time, it's no good unless your wife is satisfied. I'll think about it. Fuck thinking about it. Pack your bags, come down there, we'll have a great time, I promise you. I will think about it. I'm going to call Viv. Go ahead, she's at work. She's not going to pick up anyways. - I'll call her after work. - Let's go, I'm-- I'm tired. I'm home. Hey, I'm in here! You hungry? Yeah. Yeah, I am. Hey. Look. What's that? So handsome. Oh, thank you. Did you put him up to this? Of course. What happened? I'm fine. Coop? It's a long story. I'm sorry. Well we have chicken, stuff for spaghetti, or... - pistachio ice cream. - Give me that. I won't spoil my dinner. So John called. Yeah? He told me about the offer he made. - What offer? - Come on. He told me about the boat and going down to the island. I think it's a good idea. I think we could use a break. I could take a couple days off work. I just got home. This is a break. I think it would be good for us. Please just think about it. Well I guess I could get eaten by a shark. We would get a shitload of insurance money. I hate when you joke like that. I'm worried about you. You don't take your meds, you won't go to the VA, I so much as mention you seeing a psychiatrist and you say no. How am I supposed to fix this? Huh? I'm sorry. No, stop. I just want my husband back. Are you awake? Okay, we can go. Huh? Go? Yeah, on the boat with John, we can go. Mmm. Good. - Do you see it? - What I don't see it. Is this how you're going to be? Look, if you're just doing this to keep me quiet and you're going to be miserable the entire trip - then let's just go home. - I'll be fine. It's just if he asks me about the war, - I'm going to jump overboard. - He won't. I told him it was off limits. Are you sure? It's like he's obsessed with death and destruction. He's an orthopedic surgeon who has a trust fund and drives a hybrid. It's-- he just needs a little adventure. Well then, he should have picked up a rifle and joined in. That would have been a sight. John Livingstone, super soldier. C'mon, he's your brother's best friend. He's doing this to help us. He probably needs this as much as we do. Come on. Come on. There he is. It's a little early for that, isn't it? Who gives a shit, we are on vacation. Yeah. Not too shabby, huh? It's a lot bigger than I thought it was going to be. - It's a 75-foot Lazara. - Ah, - permission to come aboard? - Oh, how could I refuse, - look, give that to him. - Here, I'll take that. - Let me help you. I got ya. - Okay. Okay. I got ya. - It's so good to see you. - You too, thanks, John. Make yourself at home, we got beers up there. - Hey, man. - Hey. I don't know if it's the boats or the sea air, but you look more like a sailor than a marine to me. Yeah? You look more like a nurse than a doctor, so. You ready for a weekend that's gonna change your life? No kumbaya shit and yeah, I'll be ready. Well there goes tonight's entertainment. So, you know how to run this thing? It's not going to be a 3-hour tour is it? No, no, no. This baby's got four 435 horsepower Volvo diesel inboards. Get this on the open water and this baby is going to purr. Bella Wood? There's got to be a story there, huh? Oh, there is. But we're going to save that one for the sea. Hop on board and let's get this party on the water. Yeah, okay. I got it, I got it. You sure you got it? Wouldn't want you to spill your beer. This is awesome. Well I guess I should give you guys the dime tour. Yeah, let's do it. All right, we are in the stern right now. For you land lovers the stern is the rear of the boat. You remember I'm a marine, right? Department of the navy? I just thought that you might be up for an education in the nautical life. - Always. - Nautical life? Since when did he become Captain Nemo? Be nice. Up here, this is the bow of the boat, anchor's over there, plenty of room to lay out and work on your tan. Hop up. Thank you. Come over here. This is the portside of the boat and that's the starboard. Port is the left. Okay. Starboard is right obviously. In here is our salon. Basically it's your living room. That the helm station, nice views, huh? Yeah, it's beautiful. Yeah, yeah, close that door, you sure you don't need help with the bag? No, I got the bag. Follow me. Come down here and let me help you Viv. - Thank you. - Watch your step. Here we have the galley, that's the pantry. It's stocked with beans, rice, et cetera. Booze. Oh, yeah. In there, we've got proteins, meats, but we'll probably fish for dinner. - you guys like seafood, right? - Yeah, I love it. All right. And if you will follow me down here, this is the cabin. All right. Now, normally this is the captain's quarters, but this weekend it's yours. No, you don't have to do that. We can sleep in one of the other cabins. You two are my guests. No, no, no, you take the master, we'll take one of the smaller rooms. It's cool. There's two of you and one of me, I'll take the cabin crew. Let's finish the tour. Oh, we've got our fishing poles and life jackets in here. And, uh, at the aft of the boat we got our zodiac, in case we run into any trouble. - What kind of trouble? - You know, if we have to take the zodiac in to one of the islands - for supplies. - Supplies means beer. You guys ready? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, let's do this. All right, Coop, you've got the bow line. It's a forward quarter line. And the midship line too. Nothing but open water. Spooky isn't it? What's that? Out here all alone. Right. Where's Coop? Manning the wheel. - You let him drive. - Why wouldn't I? Because we have no idea where we are. Saybird keys about an hour that way. If your marine doesn't mess up, we'll see it in about 15 minutes. - Ah. - We can drop anchor and party there for the night. How does that sound? Oh, that was so good. Thank you. That was delicious. Woah. My bad, my bad, my bad. Uh, you need another beer? Yeah. And could you get me some paper towels. Here here's a towel. I'm so full. - Do you want more? - Mm-hmm. There's plenty more below in my room, so have as much as you want. Mmm, thank you. If we're not hung-over by tomorrow, we're doing this wrong, right Coop? Right. Oh. Thank you. When was the last time you guys had a poker night? What do you say? - I'm game. - You realize that everything I know about poker, I learned from Danny. So yeah, I'm down to kick your ass. Well, if Danny boy taught you, I am upping the ante, because he was a terrible bluffer, pitiful actually. Five-card draw, no wild. So, how are things at the hospital? Uh, nothing new. Same old, same old. Nothing exciting. Really? Come on, nothing new? There has to be something. Well, if you guys must know, uh, I am seeing someone. Really? that's great! Well, it's new. She's, uh-- she's a resident. - Oh, well that's not surprising. - Hmmm. That's a little young for you, isn't it, doctor? Let me guess, she's a brunette. Oh, how did I guess? She is. She is a brunette, and I guess some things don't change. Back in my hell-raising days, which was long before I met you of course, me and Danny and John we would walk into a bar. Any bar. - Every single bar. - Every bar. And within 15 seconds, Danny would pick out the girl. And if Danny was interested, then John didn't stand a chance. You're a bastard, you're a bastard. It was crazy, it was crazy. Uh, he had a gift. He was a ladies' man, that's for sure. - Is it mine? - Yeah. Yeah, um, speaking of gifts, uh, can you still hotwire a car? What? She doesn't have to know about everything man. Oh, come on, Danny taught him how to hotwire cars, and Coop here, he would take him for joyrides for hours. All right, that was like one time. Maybe it was five times. We never got caught never ever. - Mug- - Mugshots! Or it didn't happen. - Here's to never getting caught. - Cheers to that. I'll cheers to that. Here. - And we're back to the lady. - Hmm. Coop you making a bet? I'm never one to run from a fight so. Oh, you learned that from Danny too. I'm all in. What? What's her name, the resident? I have the best idea, let's call her. - Yeah! - A girl loves a drunk dial - from the ocean. - Loves it. - Come on, come on, call her. - Sam. Samantha, actually, but she goes by Sam. And, uh, I am sorry. - No dice guys. - Ah, bullshit! No, no, we are officially off the grid. No signal. - Why didn't you invite her? - She had to work. You couldn't pull any strings? Viv. See and call. There. Come on, all right, dealer. Show us your cards. - You sure you can handle it? - Of course I can. Three of a kind. That's nice. But it's not nice enough. - Straight flush. - Oh. - I'm sorry, baby, that's all me. - It is all you, buddy. Wow! You got a picture of Sam? Bust it out. Wow. Are you sure you didn't pull that from the internet? No, she looks real enough, kind of, partially. I mean, she's got a big... A really big heart. - She has a really big heart. - That's what I was going to say. I was going to say she has a really big heart. John always liked a girl with a big heart. I always have liked the ones with big hearts. Do either of you gentleman want a real drink? Yes. - Yes? John? - Yeah, sure. I'll have one. I'm going to go upstairs for a quick smoke though. Are you serious? Did you say a smoke? I said smoke. Since when the fuck do you smoke? Well, since I met Sam. There you go. Since when does he smoke? He's drunk. No, no there's something off about him. No. We're just all a little drunk. John, are we going to do this? It's late. Come on. I'm coming. - There he is. - Oh, finally. What you got there? This is the Greener mark 2. Same kind of harpoon gun that Quint used on Bruce. Bruce? The shark from Jaws. Are we going shark hunting? You never know what you're going to run into out here. I mean, it is open water. Coop... Cooper. Captain David Cooper, United States Marine Corps. Devil Dog. Killer of all enemies, foreign and domestic. Sharpshooter. John, come on. Come on, Coop, talk about it. It's therapeutic. You know, I almost became a therapist instead of a surgeon it would have been a lot less precise. Okay. Let's just play cards, boys. Come on. So... Coop, you kill anyone? Dammit, John, stop it. - John, stop. - I am not doing this shit, man. Coop, sit down. He's just kidding. You're kidding right, John? Come on, it's unloaded. Fuck off! I'm just trying to help. Well, stop, you're not helping. Come on, Coop, I was just trying to help. You know, you act like a calm ocean but you are turbulent underneath. Hey, hey. I've done some terrible, terrible things, John. I've seen humanity at its worst and I don't want to talk about it. Okay. okay. Look, I'm sorry. All right? You guys are my guests and I, uh-- I had a little too much to drink and I was just trying to help and I'm sorry. I was wrong. Can you forgive me? All right? Tell you what. Tomorrow, we can do whatever you want. All right? I need some rum. Um, we have tequila and vodka and... Strictly a rum girl. Strictly. I got a whole case in my-- in my cabin. I'll go get it. Easy, captain, I can get it. I'm a big girl. Just bring two bottles. Aye, aye. You know, her tits are real. Sam. I mean, none of that fake shit. And they're awesome. Both of them. Just saying. You know, I, um... Sorry for asking about what happened over there. It's just, I saw what it did to your brother. He bottled it up inside. You remind me a lot of how he was when he came back. I'd hate to see anything happen to my best friend's kid brother. I'm not a kid anymore. I know that. It's just, you are different. I'm different. You mean to say that war changes people? Maybe you're the one who's different. Maybe we are all a little different. You know, more grey, more wrinkles. - More loose marbles. - Mmm. I'm sorry for coming at you earlier. I probably should have just thanked you for watching over her when I was gone, but you just... No, you don't need to thank me. You guys are family. Danny was the only flesh and blood I had left. Viv is everything, and I don't know what she would have done without you. She is a tough chick, she would have managed. Yeah, she is. Well, cheers to that. What are you guys toasting? To you. And John. Oh... Why is that? - Because we're fucking awesome? - Right. Did you find what you were looking for? The rum. Oh, yeah. Um, I'm really tired all of a sudden. Coop, do you want to go to bed? Goodnight. Looks like someone's looking for a trip to the Mini Coop dealership. I want to hear more about Sam tomorrow. Goodnight. Hold on, hold on. Wait a second. Wait, what's wrong? Just come here. It's okay, it's all right. It's all right. When is not fucking all right? It's just... I'm sorry. It's not a problem. Okay? - I'm not done with you. - Oh, what? Just because I can't doesn't mean that you can't. - Come here. - Oh, no, no. Why do you still wear these? They're my dog tags. No. They're a reminder of all the shit you went through on Anchor. A leash wrapped around your neck that won't let you come home to me. I am home. Are you? Goodnight. Morning. Morning. How did you sleep? Good. Coop? Like a log. Cooper... Sharpshooter... Did you kill anyone? Morning, Coop. Morning, babe. Are you going to join your wife and I for a little swim in the ocean? Not much of a morning person, is he? I'm going to go take a shower. Hey, Coop. All right, Coop. Let's see how well you can swim, buddy. - Hey, buddy. - You motherfucker. Oh, hey, man. What's the matter? Did the tide get you? - The current too strong? - You fucking dick. Aw, come on. No harm, no foul. Here, let me help you out. Woo! Nice, huh? Woo-hoo! That's it... Woo! I'm gonna retire out here. - You're retiring? - Yeah. Look at this. This is the life. Not a care in the world. All I need is a good woman and enough money to take island runs. That wouldn't be so bad, would it? I guess it wouldn't. Plus, there's nobody around for miles. What about that guy? Oh, yeah. Looks like he's trying to hone in on your action. Maybe. - You're a dick. - I know, I know. That two-mile swim made me hungry. Yeah, it's all done. Come and get it. What are we having for dinner? - Fish. - Oh, okay. great. - I caught that. - Oh, good. Have you seen where that boat went? I think it went back for civilization. What are you two talking about? There's a fishing boat out there a little while ago. - Oh. - It's no big deal, nothing to worry about. I'm not worried, I'm more worried about you two. Oh, no need, Mom. You guys mind if we do a prayer first? - Sure. - Sure. Dear Lord, master and commander of the air, land, and sea. Like your disciples caught in the fury of a storm on their tiny vessel, we come to You for peace on the remainder of our journey. We come to You for love and understanding as we reestablish our friendship. And we ask for your blessing on this bountiful harvest. In Christ's name, we pray. - Amen. - Amen. Okay, let's eat. You said there was a story behind the name of the boat. What's the story? Bella Wood. There is, and it's a good one. So, I got my love of the ocean from my pop and my grandpop. My pop was in the Navy and my grandpa in the Marine Corps. And you were the only one who sat out? I had a medical condition. Eh, that's not the way Danny said it. Anyway... my grandpop, he served in World War I. Second Marine Division. France? June 1918. The Battle of Belleau Wood. You know your history. So, my grandpa was, uh, Anson. He was injured in that battle and he, uh, somehow, by the grace of God, found his way to this rundown hospital in a nearby town. And, uh, there he was tended to by this beautiful French nurse. Was she brunette? Oh, and with a big heart? Oh, did she drive a Camaro? Have I told you guys this story before? So for some reason or another, my grandfather nicknamed her Bella. Um, this chick didn't speak a lick of English. Well, my grandfather would call out and have I mentioned to you how smooth he was? He would call out "Bella" and this nurse, she'd would run to him, change his bandages, give him a sponge bath, and Lord knows what else she did because whatever it was, he started dreaming about her. And how I know this is his bunkmates told him that in the middle of the night, while he was dreaming, he would call out "Bella-wood Bella-wood". So your grandmother's name is Bella? - No. - Oh. No. Look, my grandmother was a saint, God rest her soul. But I don't think my grandpa ever got over Bella. Well, that's understandable. I mean, she was there for him when he needed her most. Yeah. Oh. Hey, looks like we got service again. Hey, it's Sam. I gotta take this, guys. - Aw. - Hey, Sam. That was such a sweet story. Really? I don't think it was sweet for the nurse that had to change the horny dude's bandages. Stop being such a cynic. Viv, do you my have my, uh... - You want that? - Ooh, wow. Instant refill. You guys want to play cards again? Oh, fuck poker. I got a better idea. Truth or dare. Now I know you're really drunk. No, I'm serious. I haven't played that game since like junior high. That doesn't matter, you're still fucking brunettes and I can still hotwire anything that moves. I haven't been hotwired yet. Are you sure about that? Yeah, that's not what I heard last night. - Gross, John. - Yeah, you're telling me. It is gross, my virgin ears. No. God, Coop, this is a really bad idea. Come on, we haven't hung out like this since before my last tour. What's going on since then and, hey, I want to hear a little bit more - about that Samantha chick. - Oh, yeah. Fine, fine, fine. Oh. Oh, wow. - I don't even know how to play. - Oh, it's okay. I'll break down the rules for you, it's real simple. Whosoever asking the question has complete control. No question is out of the question, not even my time in the service, but you have to answer truthfully. Oh, I can't believe we're gonna do this. And if it's a dare, you have to do the dare. That's it, that's the rules. All right, fine. Fine. - I'm in. - Yes, we're doing it. Okay, you go first. It's your boat, you go first. Okay. Truth or dare? Truth. When did you lose your virginity? Really? That's your fucking question? Hey, I don't know the answer to that question. - Ah! - Yes, you do. It was on our fourth date. Yeah, I don't think that's you telling the truth. Well, it's not your question. - Well... - I don't think that was the rules as they were explained to me. You said "honesty." - Mm-hmm. - I was 17 years old. With who? One question at a time, please. Okay, my turn, my turn. Truth or dare, Coop? Dare. Who with? I said dare. Okay. I dare you to tell me who with, truthfully. Uh, some girl named Amanda. I played football and she was a cheerleader and it was the American dream kind of, not really. Amanda Matthews? One question. No more questions. Amanda Ma-- That is my babysitter! I mean, she didn't come to my wedding-- I mean, my wed-- our wedding. It was a really long time before you and I met. How could you? Was it good? Was it-- John, ask-- Your turn, ask a question. Me? I go again? John, don't do her any favors. Ask your own question. - Anything. - I'm sorry, Viv. Did you kill anyone in Afghanistan? John, really, again? He said we could ask any question even Afghanistan time. You are so fucking predictable. You do not have to answer this question. No, it's okay, I'll answer the question. It's only fitting that the good doctor who is supposed to be saving people's lives is so curious about the other side of the equation. Coop. Really... I've been running from those ghosts for a long time and I'm sick of running from them. So that's a yes? Thirteen. Thirteen people? Truth or dare? Truth. How did you get through it? You. Knowing I was coming home to you, to start a family. I never have to go back again and be away from you. Is it my turn yet? I haven't even asked a single question. Yeah, sure. Thank the Lord Jesus. Truth or dare... John? - Truth. - Excellent choice. Dare. - Dare? Are you sure? - Dare. I dare you... to kiss my wife. - What? - What? You heard me. I'm not going to kiss him. - Yes, he is. - No, I am not gonna kiss her. Do I need to recap the rules for you? Kiss her. This is so ridiculous. Come on. What's the big deal? It's not like it means anything, right? - What? - Kiss her. Kiss her. Come on, John. Kiss her. Fine. Viv? It wasn't so hard, was it? Viv? Viv, come on. Go away. Viv? Viv? Come on. What the hell is wrong with you? What the hell is wrong with what? - With that that stupid game. - I was just playing around. That-- Yeah, it wasn't funny. It wasn't funny. Seriously, what is wrong with you? I'm sorry. Stop. No. When we get home, I don't care, you are taking your medicine. I am taking my medicine, why don't you count it? I've seen you throw them down the drain. I've seen it. I don't like the way that it makes me feel. Well, I don't like the way that you make me feel. I don't care if you take one or if you take two or you take the whole fucking bottle. Just replace this asshole that's in front of me. I don't know if I should be mad at him or you. Parker, get behind that bunker. Spooky, isn't it? What's wrong? She won't start. What? Bella won't start, but that's okay because you can hotwire anything, right? No, no, I haven't hotwired anything in 20 years and I sure as shit never fixed a boat. Shouldn't be a difference. Here, help me out in the engine room. Come on. You've got to be kidding me. Oh, man. You said you got a steal on this thing. How much you pay for it? You're not being helpful. Where's the radio? Attached to the computer, so it's not working. Engine troubles? We think it's electrical. What about phones? No service. What does that mean? It means we're dead in the water. But... John, do you have maps? What about a flare gun, you got one of those? Flare guns, check in there in the ottoman. See, the map's here. - Is your navigation working? - It's dead. The whole computer system is down But these are all Pacific. This is not gonna help us. I think... Where are we? I don't know, somewhere. Somewhere? That is not an answer that I love. I think we're-- I think I found it. That's where we were, so we're right around here. What's that? It's Rum Quay, there's a supply station there. About how far do you think this is? If I had to guess, I'd say 15 miles. Fifteen miles north. Well, we could uh... The Zodiac. I'll take it, I'll go there. I'll get help. I'll help you pull it out. You can't just leave us here. We can't just stay here and hope that someone comes back and finds us. Just take us with you. No, someone's gotta stay here with the boat - in case they find it. - Coop, come on. No, he's right, somebody's gotta stay. I'll go. - What? - What? No, man, this is-- it's my responsibility. David. David. Vivian, it's fine. I'm gonna take this thing to the mainland, John's gotta stay here and work on his boat-- And try to get Bella back up and running - and you'll get the help. - Let's do it. John, can you just give us a minute, please? Are you sure you wanna do this? I don't trust him to do it. - Look, about last night-- - No, I don't. - I love you. - I love you. Here, hold this for me. Okay. Be careful. I survived fours tours in Marjah. This will be cake. Are you sure he's gonna be all right? Of course he is. What's your deal? - What are you talking about? - I don't know. You're just been acting really... really strange. What, like pretending? I mean, we both have. What are you talking about? Viv, I mean, come on, we gotta stop dancing around like this, it's not fair to Coop. I'm not dancing around anything, I-- Oh, so you're not thinking about what happened last August between us? Coop was right. This is all making sense. I mean, why do you have this? Because we belong together. Here! What are you doing in the middle of the ocean in a rubber raft? We got some boat trouble. Who's "we"? Uh, there's a couple of us a few miles back. All of our electric just went out. You in the corps? Why do you say that? Your ink. You got a good eye. Twenty years in the Navy. All right. I'm glad to see you then. I was worried you might be a pirate. You're not sporting a peg leg back there, are you? No, but you know, as a matter of fact, I've got a parrot. Your cell phone and your wallet. Next one's in your leg. Now your wallet. Cooper. That's it? What, are you just a one-bullet marine? Fucking jarhead. John, I am married to your best friend's brother. I mean, you have a girlfriend, this is-- Well, Sam's not really a girlfriend. How could you do this? You brought us on this boat. - Yeah, I did. - And then Coop's out there. - I mean-- - Yeah. - We're trying to help him. - Yes, we are. We're like family! Why would you do this? Yes, we are family, all right? We are family and I love you. - No-- - No, I love you and I want-- I wanna to help you. I want you to have everything you want. I want you to be with a man that will do everything he can to satisfy you, not with some limp dick-- When I say it out loud like that, it just sounds like an obvious choice for you. I have loved you since the day I met you. Since the first day I saw you. Do you know how hard it is for me-- - Stop! stop! - You know how hard it is for me to see you with him every night-- With him? - Wait! John, please, no! - No, I want you! Wait, what's that? Who is that? I saw your distress flag. What seems to be the problem? No power, dead in the water. You know anything about engines? Twenty years, Navy mechanic. Permission to come aboard? Granted. Are you Bella? No, I'm Vivian. I'm Samuel. Nice to meet you. Have you seen anyone out on the water today? What do you mean? My husband took the Zodiac looking for help and I thought maybe you saw him or... No. You're the only one I've seen the past two days. The engine's down here. Okay. All right, uh, Viv, keep an eye out for Cooper, okay? Uh-huh. I'm sure he'll turn up. It's in here. This is how I disabled her. Smart. That's great. I did my job, now you do yours. That's a lot of money. I need proof. I got proof. - Where? - The boat. Front well, you can't miss it. I'll go check it out, then I'll pay you. You pay me first. Fine. It's a pleasure doing business with you. Yeah. I don't see him, I'm starting to get worried. Coop will be fine, Viv. I'm sorry about earlier. Where are you going? Uh, he needs, uh-- he needs some tools to fix the engine. I'll be right back. Please, please. Finally. Do you have my husband's phone? I don't know. Well, I do-- - I don't know, is this-- - Why do you have his phone? - Is this his? - Yes. Why do you have it? Keep your mouth shut. Watch your step. That's a good girl. Shit. Viv! Shit! No! Oh, God, Coop. John, what are you doing on this boat and where's that motherfucker who shot me? You're shot. Where's Vivian? He took her. Who? The guy who shot you. He killed three people and took Viv. Why aren't you going after them? It won't start. Watch out. Fuck! Fuck. That should do it. Take the wheel. Here's binoculars. I think its engines are stopped. Why are you-- you're hurting me. Why do you have my husband's phone? Just tell me. Ow! Why are you doing this? Where is my husband? - In the belly of a big fish. - No, no, no. Ow! Please. No, no, no. Truth or dare, John? Come on, Coop. Did you sleep with my wife? Do you even know who you're talking to? We're family, man. Come on. I've seen the way that she looks at you. And how is that? With regret. And what about the picture? The one that you tore me and Danny out of? Why did you do that? You know, Viv was right about you. You're different now. Come on. Answer the question, John. You were gone for a long time. You don't even know what it was like for her. I don't know what it was like? I'm out there getting shot, motherfucker. We're getting killed, and what are you doing? That's what I want to know. I wanna know the truth. She needed a friend and I was there for her and you weren't. And that's it. You were never forgotten with us. So, can we focus on getting her back now? Is that all right? No. Please, just let me go. We're in the middle of the ocean, little girl. No. Please, no. Oh. Oh. I'm sorry, please just let me go. I was going to use your mouth. That's a shame. What the fuck? Don't you make a sound. Oh! Dead man walking. Yeah. I thought my aim was a little better than that. Coop. Sorry, I thought I killed him. Where is she? Where is she? Where's who? Where is my wife? Oh, she's dead. Sam, you weren't supposed to touch her. - Sam? - Yeah. The fuck are you talking about, John? He doesn't know. He paid me to kill you. He's lying. You're a fucking liar, John. I'm gonna blow your fucking head off. You trying to get rid of me so that you could steal my wife. You're a fucking dead man. Fucking traitor. Coop! Vivian. Don't talk to her. What's going on, Coop? John hired this piece of shit so that he can get rid of me and have you, it's why he brought us here. He's not--he's not right in his head, Viv-- You're a fucking liar! Coop, Coop, come on, come on. Give me the gun. Give me the gun. Coop, come on, stop. You're better than this. Put it down, put it down, put it down. Danny would have pulled that trigger. Stop! I thought you were dead. You too. Coop. John. You just won't die. Don't do anything stupid, John. You weren't supposed to come back. Viv and I were gonna be fine. No, we weren't, don't listen to him. Shut up! You want to be the hero? Danny was the hero. You should've died, not Danny. You've always been a lousy shot, John. John! John! Coop! Fucking bitch. What do we do now? Now?
