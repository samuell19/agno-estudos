Grace? - Grace! - What? My God, don't... do that to me, OK? Not today. So, I was thinking maybe I could make you something special for breakfast. Would you like that? Anything you want. You want chocolate chip pancakes? No, no thanks. Um, I'm gonna go meet up with some friends. That's good. That's good, that's... that's about a million times better than pancakes. Well, don't forget we have lunch with Grammy. She really wants to see you before you go away. Yeah, Mom, I know. I'll be back in time. I promise. OK. Hey, Kit. I know it's early, but I just wanted to make sure that everybody was still getting together for coffee this morning. So... call me back. Or I guess I'll just see you later. OK. Bye. Damn, that is quite a haul. Why can't you just leave me alone? Praise the Lord Almighty, she speaks. It's about time you acknowledged my presence. You're not supposed to be here. You think? God. Gross. What are you doing? Let's see here... "Beloved daughter and friend. She was the wind beneath our..." Really, Mom? Bette Midler? Gonna send me off to the pearly gates to the soundtrack of Beaches? - Why don't you go haunt her? - I'm not a ghost, Gracie. I'm the manifestation of your guilt. Um, Grace, why is there a pumpkin on my headstone? Gourds are a symbol of deliverance from grief. This is your legacy, in stone, forever. I mean, look, we got, what? "Mother." "Brother." "Soldier." I mean, I don't even know him, I respect him. What are people gonna think a hundred years from now when they look at mine? - "Jennifer Bateman, pumpkin freak. She loved her pumpkins." - And Beaches. God, this must be the purgatory I've heard so much about. See, now, this... this is something I could get behind. It's basic granite. No muss, no fuss... It is a little big and douchey, but I guess it's too late now. That's the problem with these untimely deaths. You're not making this any easier. I'm sorry, was I supposed to be? What? Dead girl's prerogative. All right. So... what'd you get me? Ooh, my necklace. It's broken. Right, 50 mile-per-hour collision. I forgot. - You should keep this. - It belongs to you. The afterlife is kind of a "leave your personal effects at the door" kind of place. So is prison. Look, Gracie, I'm a rotting corpse. - What's on the agenda? - I made a list. Of course you did. Give it. Lame, lame, super lame... "Cake"? The final item on your last day of freedom is to eat some cake? I asked my mom to make one. Who knows if she'll actually do it. Well, unless there is a file in that bad boy, I just don't think it's gonna be very satisfying. It's my list. OK? I don't need your approval. Good, 'cause you're not gonna get it. I don't care what you think. I'll do what I want. Well, that much is apparent. - You're not welcome here. - I'll leave. Good. Actually, I won't. Excuse me? You know, I've held my tongue this entire time while everyone used me as their own personal punching bag. I knew my place in this mess. But I am sick and tired of pretending that I didn't lose anything too. She was my best friend. Let me ask you a question, Grace. What was my daughter doing when she died? What were her final words? - I don't remember. - What was that? I said I don't... I did not believe that in that police station and I do not believe it now. Get off my daughter's grave right now. As Jesus said in John... Pretty lame turnout. Hope mine was bigger. Right, you wouldn't know because you weren't there. - I wasn't invited. - It's a funeral, Grace, you don't RSVP chicken or fish. You know what I mean. I'll try not to take it personally. Dang, Mama got you good. You know, I think she's been watching too many of those soap operas. Wait. No, because she'd probably be more likely to believe that whole... - what was it? That amnesia line? - It's not a line. So you're saying that you don't remember anything from that night? The doctor said it was post-traumatic. Yeah, but don't you get those memories back? People can. So why don't you try something new, like... hypnosis or Ginkgo biloba? Nothing worked. Can we just drop it, please? Fine. Touchy. What's next? What? I'm not going anywhere. Can I get you anything? She's crazy. My God. So Kit was a no-show. I never liked her. It's not her fault. It's the situation. Just makes people uncomfortable. No. She's just a bitch. - What are you doing? - I just remembered, I need to take some books back to the library. Give me that. Let me see it. - Your list is stupid. - Excuse me? In less than ten hours, you're gonna be locked away in some crappy state prison, and what are you doing? Chores. This is your final day of freedom. You should be living it up. - Getting laid. - This isn't my bachelorette party, OK? Time is precious. Take it from me, the dead girl. You spend today tidying up your life and bending over backwards for people, it's gonna be a giant waste. I don't want a day to be selfish. - I don't deserve it. - How do you know? You don't even remember that night. They found me behind the wheel with a blood alcohol level of .18. It's enough for the prosecutor and it's enough for me. - Is it really? - Why are you doing this to me? Do you really think it was my final wish to watch my best friend self destruct? Just leave me alone! Look, I'm going home, I'm eating lunch with Grammy J, I'm finishing my list and I'm not thinking about you anymore. - You can't do that. - Why not? You say you have my best interests at heart, but can't you see you're making me miserable? Having you here is making me miserable. Grace, do you really think that you're gonna find peace in lockdown? You need this. I'll be fine. You have spent the last four months blocking out the six most significant hours of your life. - Why do you think that is? - I tried to remember. Did you really? What if it really was all my fault? You're not OK, Gracie. You're broken. And I'm gonna fix you. Grace? Yeah, I was just on my way home. How did it go? Did you get to say your goodbyes? Yeah. Well, hop in. You know how Grammy gets when we run late. Take a deep breath. OK. I was talking to myself. You're not really going in there. Hey, I am not giving up on you. Deal with it. One, two... one, two, three, four! ♪ I'm Henry the Eighth I am! ♪ Henry the Eighth I am, I am Grace, are you OK? - What? -♪ I got married to the woman next door ♪ - ♪ She's been married seven times before ♪ - You barely touched your lunch. - ♪ And every one's a Henry, Henry! - ♪ - I'm not hungry. ♪ Something, something, something, something No sir! ♪ - Nonsense. You need a good meal in you before... -♪ I'm the one and only Henry ♪ And my Henry's really long - ♪ My Henry's really long ♪ - You didn't eat before you came here? Did she eat, Ann? I have to go to the bathroom. She's struggling. Wouldn't you be? You're her mother. Your job is to protect her. I did protect her, Mom. The DA said that... The DA didn't see the accident. He's not sure what happened that night. Neither is Grace. Do you want me to risk putting her through a trial? Do you want me to put her under that scrutiny? Two years is better than 20. For that young girl... two years may as well be 20. This is why I didn't want to come here. - It's the same every time. - Sounds like Grams has a point. This is a serious time suck. If we're gonna retrieve those elusive memories of yours, we need to get the hell out of here. I just don't think it's a good idea. Well, I think you need to start putting your trust in me. - Why? - Because I'm your Jiminy Cricket. Except with bigger boobs. Come on, you can't say that this isn't killing you not knowing. Fine. Go rejoin the wet blanket brigade. At least your last few hours of freedom will feel like an eternity. Even if I wanted to, I mean, there's no way my mom's gonna let me skip out now. - You're good. Drop down. - I don't know. It's like two feet, tops, Grace. You're golden. Just drop. Look, the next time we encounter a word problem, I'll defer to you, but in matters of general badassery, I am not to be questioned. Now, drop. Nice! There you go. Not so hard, right? Mom has the tendency to lock herself out. Might as well be gift-wrapped. Grace Flynn, boosting a car. You know, I never thought I'd live to see the day. And I didn't. You know, you could still make a break for it, drive down to Mexico. Couple of well-spent pesos, you could be Juanita Suarez by morning. Weren't you the one encouraging me to confront the events of that night? Well, yeah, but who says you can't confront them with a margarita and a couple of tequila shots? Fine. Just thought I'd throw it out there. Canada? OK, OK. You're no fun. All right, what's the last thing you remember? The castle. Ring any bells? Not really. You know, usually in the cartoons it takes like a conk to the head to get your memory back. Hey... a penny. Lucky. Hey, a penny. Lucky. Now don't say I never gave you anything. OK, pick it up, Donna. Ready? Go! - Hey! - What? I'm making a wish. Will you remind me again why I haven't been dating the "of age" all along?! You know, I'm really not OK with this. Grace, they're 21. We're not aiding and abetting. We're... chauffeuring. OK, and if our parents find out we've been chauffeuring a couple of college guys to the liquor store, we're gonna be grounded into oblivion. Come on, Grace, this whole night is supposed to be about you - and breaking out of that shell. - Really? I thought it was about you getting laid. Missions rarely have just one objective. Jackson thinks you're cute. All right, fine. I guess it's just gonna be me and two older guys I barely know at some random college party with tons of liquor and GHB and... Fine! Fine, fine, OK? - Come on! The party's waiting! - Hello. Wow, we really looked good that night. You bet your ass we did. You better hold on to this one. And you were worried this wouldn't work. I predict total recall by suppertime. Why are we parked so far away? I'm not even supposed to be on the road. There's no way I'm parking at the liquor store. That was quick. I knew we should've left the shower running. - Did he ever call you? - - Who? - Jackson. - What do you think? Bummer. Did you like him? Not really, no. So is Pete dating anyone? 'Cause it'd be pretty tactless if he was. You know, there's a mourning period. Like a real one, not just the kind you hear about in Cosmo. So what do you think prison's gonna be like? I don't know, I haven't really thought about it. Liar. Ooh, do you think you're gonna have to become a LUR? - A what? - - Lesbian until release. - I saw it on Lockup. - Please. - Anything? - Nope. Well, maybe you're not doing it right. Here, close your eyes. Or, wait a minute, maybe I gotta bend down again. Look, we're not gonna find anything. Whoa. Is that Pete? Wait, he didn't look like that when we went out, right? - Look, we should go. - No way, we should follow him. What? He could give us a clue. My God, he is taking this really bad. Hey, where is your downward spiral? Why aren't you drowning your sorrows in cheap booze? It's all about levels, man. This whole repressed memory thing is great and all, but... All right. Talking to myself. Awesome. Hey, wait up. What's the plan? Look, I'm done wasting time on this wild goose chase, OK? This was a mistake. Let's just forget it. I'm sorry, I know you have an exciting day of book returns planned. I'm just trying to save your soul. I'm not remembering anything. - It's pointless. - What is this about? Pete? Look, if it makes you feel any better, I heard his dad is an alcoholic. These things are genetic. It was... Can't you take a hint? I don't want you here! Leave! So... should be a good party. Brooke's parents have a pool. I didn't bring a swimsuit. That's all right. Don't need one. No, no, no. No, what I mean is that Brooke probably has an extra swimsuit that she could loan you because... chicks have those. Right? Who the hell was that? I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? It's kind of my policy to get the first and last of someone trying to kick my ass. I mean, I don't know. Aah... Do you? I didn't get a good look. Wait, wait, wait. Well, whoever she is, she's after my man. Where are you going? I'm just, gonna catch up with you guys later. Um, yeah. My God. Your mom totally narc'd you out. Bitch. - Hey, what are you doing? - Ending this. Whoa! Whoa, whoa. Let's not make any rash decisions here. We're making progress. Um... What are you doing?! Stop it! How are you doing this? You aren't even real! Haven't you ever seen Fight Club? Listen to me, OK? I don't want you here. Do you understand? So leave me alone! I can't do that. Grace? I thought that was you. Are you OK? Hey... Grace. Would you hold up a second? - No. - He probably thinks you're a sure-fire lay. Like in the 1940s, you're gonna be shipped off in the morning. Listen, I know I should've come to you sooner, but I didn't know what to say. Grace. Hey, did anyone see you at that liquor store? Is that a threat? - I guess that depends on your answer. - Knee him in the balls. Not that it's any of your business, but I'm retracing my steps. Trying to piece together what happened leading up to... Look, are you satisfied or do you want to check my bag, too? You don't remember what happened that night? Bits and pieces. But, I heard that you pled guilty to the accident. Yeah, my mom thought it would be easier. No messy trial. What? Is there something I need to know? Yeah. I don't know. We went to a house party at a friend's in Chesterfield that night. Brooke. Yeah, so you remember. Bits and pieces. All right. Well, um... I don't know, we were all just drinking and having a good time. Just like a normal night. And then eventually you and Jennifer wanted to go home. But you were really wasted, so Jennifer and Pete helped you out to the car. And? - Doesn't bring back anything? - No, and... no. And what? Pete was driving. How could you not tell me? I wasn't there, you know? I didn't want to speculate. You mean you didn't want the police to speculate. I'm sorry. No one ever talks about that night. Where did we go after the liquor store? - Do you know what this means? - That you value the opinions of others - over your dead best friend? - No, that there's a chance that I didn't kill you. - Wait, what? - Don't you get it? If Pete was the one driving, then he's the one that got into the crash. Not me. OK, but they only found two of us in the car and you were behind the wheel. Well, maybe he swapped us out. Maybe he booked it for the woods before the police came. I mean, the drinking, the downward spiral, it all adds up. Those aren't the actions of a guiltless person, they're just not. - OK, no, but... - We need to get moving. I mean, if I can get my memories back, then maybe I can clear my name. God, all this time... - Grace, maybe you should just... - Just what? Nothing. What are we waiting for? If we came in here, I know I got one of these. Been on this weird binge this year. Grace, you have been manhandling that Twinkie for ten minutes now. You're skeeving out the guy behind the counter. Shh! I need to concentrate. Be the Twinkie. Be the Twinkie. Be the Twinkie. It's not working. Well, don't force it. Just let it be. I didn't know Zen was so popular amongst the dead. Yeah, we're all about the parables. Look, we are running out of time. I mean, at this rate, I'm never gonna get my memories back. I wasn't the one dragging my feet the first leg of the journey. Red Laces! You can't find these anywhere. I'm beginning to think this party's a bad idea. Of course you are. You're you. I mean, what do we know about this person? Brooke Daniels? Apparently, she's a pool owner. OK... Look, I mean, we're not even there yet and Pete's already drinking. Yeah, it's called pre-gaming. Who wants to waste valuable socializing time getting a buzz on? What do you even know about this guy? You mean, besides what I read in his police file? You know, when I'm gone in September, you're not gonna have anyone to look out for you anymore. I think I'll survive. OK, so there were like, one, two, three things wrong with that. - What? - Well, first off, my hair wasn't in a ponytail. - Why would it be in a ponytail? - What are you talking about? OK, do you remember those puzzles from Highlights for kids? Where they put those seemingly identical pictures side by side and you had to circle what was wrong with one of them? - Yeah. - Well, that last memory was full of wrong, my hair being circle number one. OK, it's like this... - Red Laces! - Circle number one. - You can't find these anywhere. - My hair. I spent a lot of time on it that night. Secondly, the employee was not the same one working today. He was a tall guy with squinty eyes and a goatee. Or is a Van Dyke? I always get those mixed up. And Pete wasn't drinking. And there you have it, an accurate memory in three easy steps. - What do you mean, Pete wasn't drinking? - He wasn't. - I just remembered he was. - Right. Incorrectly, like my hair and the clerk. How do you know that? I know what you know. You didn't say anything about the other memories, like the liquor store or the castle. 'Cause those weren't wrong. - So why now? - I told you not to force it. Grace. Hi. Hey. I'm sorry about earlier. I only just got your message and I was... Yeah, it's OK. I guess we could get that coffee now. If you want. Tell her to stick that coffee up her... Thanks, but I'm kind of in the middle of something. Maybe some other time? I mean... when you get back. Sounds good. Hey, Kit? Do you know who Brooke Daniels is? No. Should I? Kit? Occupied. No, I guess not. - She's lying. - I know. So where to next? There are five listings in Chesterfield for "Daniels." Let's find one with a pool. Detective, did you find her? No, but we found your car. Would you like a ride to the impound lot? I'm gonna get my keys. Ann, I meant it when I said I will call you as soon as we find her. I know. I made the right choice... didn't I? Taking the plea bargain? - Ann... - I mean, it's just that I know that teenagers are supposed to test their limits. I know that. But the thing about Grace is she never did. I mean, it's literally like she just skipped a step. She made a mistake. She's not above making mistakes, none of us are. Of course not. It's just she wouldn't... Somebody spiked her drink. Somebody gave her that alcohol. We talked to all her friends. Nobody saw them that night. And if they did, they're not talking. Is it likely that someone bought the alcohol for them? Yeah. But that doesn't change anything. Grace got a lousy deal. And for the DA to pick this case to make a statement... But... there was more than enough evidence at the scene to ensure a conviction. I understand. I do. I'm sorry. It's just... today's the day. Yeah. Man, this really opens the floodgates? Not really. Then pump harder. Look, Jen, I appreciate the sentimentality, I really do, but we never used to spend time at the park. - Yep. - No. - Tons of misadventures. - Such as? OK, when you had your first kiss in the sandbox. Or when I fell off the jungle gym and broke my arm in, like, three places. Ooh, or when we caught your brother smoking cigarettes underneath the bridge. What? That didn't happen. God, I am trying to recapture our youth here. Why are you fighting me on this? OK, shouldn't a trip down memory lane involve events that actually happened? Excuse me for trying to give us our Beaches moment. I knew you liked that movie more than you let on. No, I don't. My God. That totally makes sense now. No, it doesn't. In middle school, when you got sick and I brought your homework by, you were bawling on the couch as the credits rolled. - OK, that did not happen. - Yes. And you blamed it on your "fever." Hey, I was highly medicated at that point, OK? - Just admit it. - No. - Come on, just admit it. - No. No. I'm taking that one to the grave. Hey, what was that all about? I just think we need to keep moving. God, I am gonna miss dweebing out with you. That and Thai food. You're practically invisible. So how long before your mom has police dogs sniffing your sweaters? I recognize this place. Is it Brooke's? I don't think so. - Come on, man, you gotta... - Maybe we should invite someone else. You know, like Kit? That bitch? Grace, loosen up. We are going to a party, not an execution. Just going by our track record. You get us into trouble, I get us out. Well, what is the alternative? A good book? Listen, my mom got me this necklace on my 16th birthday. And when she gave it to me, she put it on my neck and she said, "I hope this brings you all the blessings the world has to offer." And since then, I have been blessed. With a 95 percent success rate in fornication. What? The Almighty would totally want me to get some. He is a benevolent dude. And now, it is your turn. I told you, I'm not interested. Nope. Two things wrong. Let's try that one again. He's a benevolent dude. And now it's your turn. He really thinks I'm cute? - Pool? - Nope. All right. Two down, three to go. You know, maybe it won't be so bad. - What? - Jail. It gives you a hell of a lot of time to think, you can pick up a trade, like magic. - Magic? - Yeah. You know, coin tricks, nothing up the sleeve. Ooh, doves when you walk into a room. It's a real great icebreaker with people, which, you know, is an area of life that you could vastly improve in. I wonder if the food's any good. I hear they have pie, like, every day. Which is awesome. It's like Thanksgiving behind bars. Can we just... can we stop talking about this, please? Grace? I don't know if you remember me. We met at Brooke's party. It's not exactly the clearest of nights. Look, I'm really sorry about what happened to your friend. - She seemed really fun. - Holla! How are you doing, I mean, in all this? - Coping. - Well, if there's anything I can do... You know, actually there is. Damn. A place like this would be hard to forget. Nice... digs. Come on. Grace! Don't you want to go inside? I'm thinking we play hooky for a bit. Why? You know, being spontaneous isn't such a bad thing. That's what Jen always says. That I'm too guarded. Last month, she dared me to spend the entire day doing anything anyone told me to do. The billboards, infomercials, strangers, friends... - No thinking, just acting. - How'd that work out? It lasted 15 minutes until I chickened out. Well, it sounds like a valuable exercise. So why not start tonight? You mean, like, right now? Yeah. I think... that you... should jump in the pool with all your clothes on. Not exactly. Well, it sounds like a valuable exercise. So why not start tonight? You mean, like, right now? Yeah. Yeah. I think... that... you... shou... Not a word. So how do we get in? What do you mean? I taught you how to pick a lock last year. There's a car in the driveway! That doesn't necessarily mean anything. Somebody's home. - We could take her. - Be serious. - How are we supposed to get in now? - I don't know. - Talk your way in. - How? Do you know any passages from the Book of Mormon? - No. - Well, there's gotta be something. Hi, ma'am. I was wondering if you'd like to buy some candy to support the local school band? So, all you have to sell is that one package of Red Laces? Yeah, they're going like crazy. You can't find them anywhere. Well, I can't say I'm a big fan, but maybe my daughter would want them. You said this is to support the school band? Yeah, it's... it's a great way to show school spirit. Because of the red. I thought Chesterfield's colors were blue and yellow? Right. It's so it doesn't clash. Would you excuse me? I have to take this. I can't believe she bought that. Well, you do look like you got jumped in a parking lot, so of course she believes you're in band. This is a nice place. It's got this whole rustic chic thing going on. God, except for this. Why is it that rich people insist on furnishing their homes with paintings that my kid brother could have painted? I mean, this one looks like monster eyeballs covered in black vomit. It's gross. You recognize anything? Yeah. What's up? Right. Brooke Daniels. Yeah, this is not good. No. Jackson! Pete said you weren't even going to be here. I changed my mind. The keg's too heavy. We need extra manpower. Well, we'll probably have to get someone from inside, then. My God. Fine. I got it. Hey, yo, Chris. Would you help me with this? And Grace, I'll catch up with you inside, all right? Hey! Is that the ex? Aah... These are starting to hurt. OK, yeah, but there's... Where'd the band girl go? Who? Is this really necessary? Are you kidding? She's unhinged! Come on, G! Holy balls, that was close. Did you see enough? I saw everything. ♪ Yeah, yeah, we're on fire ♪ And it's burning me so... ♪ Yeah, yeah, we're on fire ♪ And it's taken control of me ♪ Desperate much? Hey! Is that the ex? Looks like you could use this. It's not like I was with him anyway. Did you like him? Well then, you should do something about it. Lost cause. She's got him by the balls. Grace, do you want to leave? We just got here. Here... - this'll help. - No, thanks. - Are you serious? - It's called self-restraint. Yeah? How's that working out for you? OK, I'll see you in a second. Grace, I meant what I said. If you like Jackson, then go stake a claim. - I can't. - Why? - It's her party. - So what? What is she gonna do? Slug you? I... Can we just let it go, please? Fine. But you are gonna man up one of these days, my friend. I'm gonna personally see to it. It's on my bucket list. ♪ Yeah, yeah, we're on fire ♪ And it's taken control of me ♪ ♪ You know we're on fire ♪ ♪ Yeah yeah ♪ We're on fire ♪ And it's burning me slow Pete told me to take care of ya. Tha... thanks. You said Jen was a done deal. But I can't get her alone. How hard is it to babysit the friend for one night? I don't know. She didn't seem into it. I've had people funneling her drinks all night. Just take her back to the castle, show her a good time. You know, or not. She won't remember a damn thing. - Whatever dude, I have other prospects. - I just need 20 minutes. Right. Watch it! This dress is new! - Hey! Having fun? - No. Can we...? Just... We need to go. And not be here anymore, OK? Holy hell. Seventeen years of vigilant sobriety and here you stand completely sauced. This is a banner day. OK, say "overcompensating." No, look... Look, I just heard Pete. He wants... He wants sex with you. God, I hope so. No, look, he's an asshole. OK, can we please just go? And I had such high hopes for the alcohol. Look, Gracie, just... relax, OK? Ride out the remainder of your buzz. Make it worth the hangover. Hey, Jenny, we're up next. Me and you, baby. Please. Please, can we just please go? You can't leave now. Winner goes to the finals. OK, OK, look, um... Go to the kitchen and get some water and I'll be in there in a minute. And then we can leave, OK? OK. Wow. OK, Grace. Jesus. In! That was in. No, thank you. It's water. I was asked to come in here and sober you up. Please don't vomit on my shoes. What? I think... I think I'm mad at my best friend. Sleep with her boyfriend, take pictures. I can't do that. You can do whatever you want. Alcohol comes with a built-in alibi. Hey. I just advanced in my bracket. Are you coming? What? OK, hold on. You're good, right? Just drink your water and remember tile's your friend. Steer clear of upholstery. What's up! What's up. You see that? Drink up. Let's see what you got. Nothin'. You ain't got nothin'. Wanna taste the heat? Damn it. - Let's go. - But if I win, I advance in my bracket. - You said we could go... - My God! I just made another one. You said we could go after I drank the water. Well, what did you do, chug it? - Counts! That counts. - Hey! What the hell? I pulled a lot of strings to get you into this college party - and what do you do, you chuck my balls. - Look, we don't belong here. No, Grace, you don't belong here. With your holier-than-thou, patron saint of fun-suck, Ivy League attitude. You're right. I don't. OK, that came out wrong. I didn't mean it... No! I know what you meant. Grace...

Hell no! The bedrooms are off-limits, didn't you read the Evite? Listen, Goldilocks, you can't just bed down wherever you please. Serious party-foul. Are you OK? I think I'm gonna be sick. Whoa, what happened? I don't feel so hot. You look like hell. And I say this because I love you. Are you OK? You left me alone. I think you should get her home. - Did something happen? - No. Why did you leave me alone? OK, Pete? Pete, it's time to go. - Already? - Yeah, grab her keys. Come on. Come on now, sunshine, here we go. Here we go. Want some water or something? I dumped bleach on your clothes. - My God. - Whoa! Whoa. It's all right. You are a mean drunk. Jesus. All right. There we go. There we go. Ooh, watch your head. Here, grab that. All right, think you can hang on there? There we go. You drive. All right. Unbelievable. You OK? Hang in there, pookie. - You good, Pete? - Yeah, yeah. We'll be home soon, Pookie. All this time... OK, I know that this isn't the best time, but there's three things... You left me alone! There's things that... There's things that you're not remembering. - Where are you going? - To see Pete. OK, you can't do that. We need to talk about that memory. - Listen to me. - No! OK? I'm done with you and your cryptic messages and your general badassery. I'm just done! Grace, just... What are you scared of? Why don't you want me to see Pete? I'm dead. What do I have left to be scared of? They'll find out that I didn't kill you. And you'll have nothing to lord over me the rest of my life. They'll finally find out. I don't owe you a goddamn thing. Fine. You know what? Make a jackass out of yourself, 'cause I'm through. Mom, pick up. Grace, your mother is looking for you. I'm going home now. - Why don't I give you a ride? - I can walk. Grace, get in the car. Grace! Grace... Come on. Come on. Come with me. Come on. Gracie. What happened to your eye? What happened to your hand? You should have someone take a look at that. It's a pretty bad gash. Thank you. OK. You stole my car. Gracie? How could you possibly think that's a good idea? Answer me. - Answer me! - Or what? Are you gonna call the cops on me again? What the hell did you expect me to do? You barely speak to me anymore, Gracie, and you run off to go to God knows where hours before I'm supposed to take you to... Prison, Mom. You're taking your little girl to prison. Don't worry. I'm sure in a few months, it'll roll right off the tongue. I wanted a day with you. That's all. I even started to make that ridiculous cake... It's not ridiculous! And I don't need anything from you. No, Grace, please don't shut me out. I'm just trying to help you. - How could you accept that plea bargain? - What? - You don't even know what happened that night. - Neither do you. I said I didn't remember! I meant that. I just took it because I was trying to protect you. I don't know what to do. Gracie, I don't know. Tell me what you want me to do! Nothing. Just stick with what you know. Hey, I need your help. Thanks. Wait, wait, wait a second. Look... I did some stuff at the party that I'm not exactly proud of. Yeah, well, in the grand scheme of things, it's not exactly the end of the world. Right. It's just that... I really did like you. - I gotta go. - Grace? Hey, are you OK? Hello? It's Brooke. Grace. Why are you...? What do you want? A lot of things, actually. Could you narrow it down a bit? Well, for starters, you could tell me how long you were planning on letting me waste away in that cell. Or possibly how you could live with yourself after what you did. Or maybe who the hell do you think you are? What are you talking about? I know you were the one driving that night. Must've been a godsend when you found out I didn't remember anything. The one loose end tied up in a neat little bow. You are way out of line. Get the hell out! Not until you admit what you did. I want to hear it. With my own ears. Before I call the cops... I want to hear you say it to me. See? I remember that night now. I remember getting in that car with you. You were the one driving. Not me. You. Do you remember me pulling over to the side of the road when you had to puke? Do you remember yelling at me when all I was doing was trying to help? The two of you just ditching me on some back road? That's not true. It's not! You're lying. I messed up, you know? The whole night. Are you OK? Are you OK? Don't touch me! Lucky. Red Laces! Hey, are you all right? Hey! Hey! Gracie! Grace, hey. Hey... Could you listen next time? I don't know what to think anymore. There's only one place you can find the answers. I need a favor. I need to borrow your car. - I'll drive. - No. I need to do this alone. Is this going to be bad? You've come this far. Are you OK? Pull over! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Here, let me get your hair. OK, there you go. Um, I'm gonna clear out the back so she can lay down. - Can you just bring her over when she's done? - Yeah, yeah. - You OK? - Don't touch me! I was just trying to... Stay away! Whoa! Hey! What happened? Where's Pete? Grace, are you cool to drive? 'Cause, admittedly, I'm pretty wrecked right now. Maybe you should just pull over. Is this about Jackson? It's about you, Jennifer! You're selfish! Always have been. Left field much? You know, I'm not the one snapping people's lucky sex accessories. You can't be serious for a second, can you? Not even when it counts. OK, I didn't realize that I was such a burden. I guess September can't roll around fast enough? OK, Grace, this is where you're supposed to say, "That's not true, Jen. You'll always be my best friend." OK, I get it. You're mad. I am sorry. But come on, we're friends. One night can't change everything. Well, maybe we aren't anymore. Maybe that's how it should be. That's... that's not it. No. Something about that was wrong. Just... Just tell me what was wrong. Grace, no. I don't understand. That's what this was about? Just showing me my final words to you were... horrible and cruel? Yes. OK, no. Grace, you... you've always been there for me and then the one time that I could've done something, I didn't. I killed you! It is not that simple. I spent the entire day trying to remember something that... I would have been better off having never known. But Grace, you knew. Deep down, you always knew. It was so much worse than I thought it would be. Was that our goodbye? What would you have said? What? For a goodbye? What does it matter? Well, I'm here now. It's not the same. I guess I would say... that you're my best friend. And I'd never had a best friend until I met you. And... I know it's not enough... and it'll never be enough... but I'm sorry. This was all my fault. - No. No... - I did this. I took you away. No, Grace, we all screwed up that night. - But I'm not supposed to! - Says who? I don't want you to be gone. I miss you so much. I know. I know. But... you made it out for a reason, you know? And I need you to believe that, Grace. Because I am counting on you to do all those things that I won't get to do. To go out there and kick ass for me. Starting out with that tattoo I've always wanted. No. I don't think I can. Grace, you are so much stronger than you think you are. I mean, I couldn't have done half of what you did today. But you're... you're... you. General Badassery. See? Come on. That wasn't so hard, right? I don't know, were you serious about that tattoo thing? Hell, yeah. You know the one I'm talking about, right? Arm band, two unicorns doing it on a cloud. So what now? Well, I guess you're gonna have time for that cake after all. I mean, what happens to you? I think you know the answer to that. Yeah, but... not now, right?
