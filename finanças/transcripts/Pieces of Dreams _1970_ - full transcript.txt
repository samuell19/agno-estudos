BOY: And I used the name of the Lord in vain. And I was disrespectful to my father. And yesterday, last night, I watched the girl across the way undress in front of a window. GREGORY: You accidentally saw her? At first, but then I kept watching. I watched her until she had nothing on. I tried to look away and do something else. Do you realize the devil put here there? Yes, Father. Deny the flesh, boy. That's the most important thing. Yes, Father. Flesh is the devil's tool. Deny the flesh, boy, deny the flesh. I'll try, Father, I'll try. Five Hail Mary's and pray for the Lord's help to resist temptation. Oh, my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee and I detest all my sins because I dread the loss of heaven and the pains of hell. [WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA] Romundo Baca, accident, couple of hours ago. Post Operative. Room B. You know where that is, Father. Hold it. Hold it. Hi Father Lind, how are you? Baca? WOMAN ON PA: Sister Alicia, please come to pediatrics. Sister Alicia, please come to pediatrics. What the hell do you want? NURSE: It's Father Lind. Oh, sorry, Father. He's had the last rites. Father Nolan was here. GREGORY: Always ends up like this. He's going to die. Stupid kids... Maybe you ought to teach 'em how to stage a decent holdup, Father. Give 'em a chance to live. The other kid must have conned him into it, Bill. Sure you're kids are all saints. But it was Romundo car. MAN: Sergeant. Yes? Excuse me. Are you Father Nolan? No, I'm Father Lind.I'm Pamela Gibson. Do you know any way we can get in touch with Romundo's mother? I sent somebody over to the house, but there was nobody there. I think his mother works with, but I have no idea where. She should be here. WOMAN ON PA: Dr. Quinlan, you're wanted in O.R. I don't even think they know at Guadalupe House. He's gone. I'll go locate his mother. I'll make the notification. Thanks for calling me, Bill. Did a lot of good. Uh, can I take you somewhere? No. No thank you. You know who she is, Bill? BILL: She's from the community center on Wells Street. Romundo used to hang around there. I'll see you later. Thanks again. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] PAUL: Gregory? I thought you were going to take confession this afternoon? BOY 1: Here, Father. BOY 2: Here, Father. Uh, there was an accident, Paul. One of Guadalupe House boys was killed. I tried to call you. Well, there's a certain routine around here. Who's the boy? I don't think you know him, his name is Romundo Baca. I'd like to have a mass for him here later in the week. Here? They're not parishioners. Don't they live in Martinez Town? Well, he came to me for confession. He was one of our settlement house kids. But still, his kind of people are much more comfortable in their own place. Oh, what are you talking about, Paul? His kind of people. What are his kind of people? Come on, you know exactly what I mean. GREGORY: Damn fool. Old damn fool. [KNOCK AT DOOR] I'm in here. PAUL: Oh, it's all right. No hurry. Knock on my door when you're out. Privacy. GREGORY: Fail, fail, fail, fail, fail. PAUL: Have you noticed how threadbare the surplices for the altar boys are looking these days Greg? They're positively shabby. You know I was thinking if we got a half dozen new ones that would tide us over for a while anyway. In the old days one of the parish women would volunteer to make them. But things have changed, haven't they, Gregory? Gregory? [CLEARS THROAT] Yes, they have, Paul. It's not a big outlay. In fact I don't think Monsignor Hurley would have any objection. Probably not. No thanks, Mrs. Tietgens. Well, then perhaps you should speak to him about it when you see him. Oh, I looked at the schedule Gregory and you can have the church day after tomorrow for the Baca boy's mass. Thank you, Paul. And you will speak to Hurley about the surplices. Mmm. Mmm, Mrs. Tietgens has outdone herself. I must remember to compliment her about it. A little oil goes a long way, Gregory. Hi, Father Lind.What's happening, boys? Frank when am I going to get out of this parish? Nothing happens quickly in our organization, Greg. I lose ground every day, Frank. Don't worry. The bishop will find the right spot for you when the right time comes. How's Paul? Paul is worried about the altar boy's surplices. I promised I'd speak to you about them for him. Tell him he can have his surplices. Greg next week we'll get together with the Bishop. Have dinner and a good long talk. Oh, Father. GREGORY: Don't con me, Frank. Words empty. Air empty. Empty words nothing. Damn, damn, damn it! GREGORY: Lord have mercy. PEOPLE: Lord have mercy. Christ have mercy. Christ have mercy. Lord have mercy. Lord have mercy. Our Father... ALL: Who art in Heaven. Hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses. As we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation. But deliver us from evil. Amen. Let us pray. [ORGAN PLAYING] Oh God, who alone and ever merciful in sparing punishment humbly we pray in behalf of the soul of your servant Romundo. Whom you have commanded to go forth from this world today. Do not hand him over to the power of the enemy and do not forget him forever. But command that his soul be taken up by the holy angels. And brought home to Paradise, so that since he hoped and believed in you, he may not undergo the punishments of hell but rather possess everlasting joys through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. Amen. Romundo Baca's at peace but none of us here can be at peace. As long as our young people die, are alienated from us by our ignorance, our neglect, our cowardice. A society which destroys its young destroys itself. We must begin to listen. Listen even when nothing is being said. [CHATTERING] [WHISTLE BLOWS] Hello. Would you excuse us please? Got good attendance. Yes. we're pleased. [CHILDREN SHOUTING] About Romundo Baca. When did he stop coming around? About two months ago. Did you find out why? I called his mother, and she said he had been going to the Wells Street community center. Did you talk to Romundo about it? He went to confession to you, Father. Do you tell everything in confession, Sister? Everything I should. Maybe that's the way Romundo felt. Look, when something happens, like a boy not showing up for a couple of months, I would like know about it. We hate to bother with details. Details is what it's all about, Sister. MAN: Look, if she said she didn't get her check she didn't get it. I believe her. Look I didn't say the V.A. is bunch of crooks. I said she needs her check to buy food for her six kids and pay for her rent that's all. Okay, okay thanks. They'll send it out but if you don't get it in two days come back here. Yeah? Is there a Miss Gibson here? No, but there's a Mrs. Gibson in the back. Pamela Gibson. Yeah who's calling? Gregory Lind. Oh, go on through she'll be through in a few minutes. Thank you. ♪ Oh, so slow, no more, more, more ♪ BOY: Let's go fast. Don't lose hands. Stay together, stay together. And we all fall down! [ALL SHOUTING] Mrs. Gibson. Yes? Can I talk to you? Sure. Just a minute. Hey, up. Come on. Hey, come on, join hands. Come on, let's go. [SHUSHING] Go around. [LAUGHS] That's quite a group you got. I knew him for five years. He made his confirmation with me. Then it turns out I don't know him at all. Well, he wandered in here one day, real tough, all swagger like a lot of kids and what he wanted was a loan for a car. Said he had a job as a bus boy at the country club. And he needed a car. So, I loaned him the money. And that's the car he used. In confessional last Saturday all he gave me was the same old junk. He was probably ashamed to tell you about Estella. She's two months pregnant. That's why he needed the car and the job. How's the girl? She's upset. The whole family is. I've been out there to see her a couple of times. How about taking me? What's the matter? Nothing. It's just that I had a whole different picture of you from Romundo that's all. What's that supposed to mean? Well, a couple of weeks ago he was in and we we're talking about... Well, we were talking about a lot of things. And he said that you were really okay. Only he wished you didn't scare him so much. Maybe it's your collar and outfit. You don't frighten me. PAMELA: Hi, Mary. [ALL CHATTERING] How are all your boyfriends? Hello Randy. Hey! How you doing? You want my mama? Yes, where's your mama? She's over there. Will you get her for us? Mama! Mama! PAMELA: Hello, Mrs. Rios. Hello. I'd like you to meet Father Lind. Hello, Mrs. Rios. Nice to see you. Hello. We'd like to see Estella. [SPEAKING SPANISH] No thank you. Father, I tried to watch her. Oh, it's all right, Mrs. Rios. Come in. Thank you. Can I take this? [SPEAKING SPANISH] Estella, Estella, hey. I brought Father Lind by to see you. Estella Rios. Hi. Pleased to meet you. Do you remember me? I'd like to try to help you if I can. How do you feel? Has she seen a doctor? I sent her to the doctor at the mission hospital. Have you given any thought to whether you'd like to keep the baby or give it up for adoption? I try my best father. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Excuse me, Father. I try to bring them up to be good religious Catholics. I pray for them every night. GREGORY: I'm sure you do, Mrs. Rios. She's the only one that turned out bad. She hasn't turned out bad, Mrs. Rios, she's just gonna have a baby, that's all. Estella, I'm giving you the name of a doctor, I'd like you to go see him tomorrow morning. He'll take good care of you. If you've got any other problems, I want you to come and talk to me. Do you understand? Why does it have to be your doctor? What's wrong with Mission Clinic? Well, she'll get a little more personal attention with my man. Wouldn't be a case of a little more personal control, would it? We like to keep it in the old pipeline, you know that. I can take you by the rectory or do you have time for a drink? Your place or mine? Your kids at the Center make these? Yeah, you like them? Yes. I think some of them are very good. Yeah. You know this is really some place you've got here. It isn't what I expected. Especially from a social worker. Right. Well, thank you. You're welcome. Cheers. Cheers. Would you like to sit down?Yeah. How did you get in social work? Well, after our marriage broke up I went to New York, enrolled in Columbia School of Social Studies and that's where I met Leo Rose. He convinced me I could do more good in my own hometown than any place else. So, I came back, hit my dad for $10,000. And now I'm on Wells Street. Ten thousand dollars? How ecumenical is your father? Very. He's also very rich. His name is Walter Gibson. He's down in Corrales. Thanks for the lead.You're welcome. You don't come from around here, do you? No, Kansas City. Well, how do you like old Albuquerque? Like it. Like it a lot. Like the people. I like the faces. [LAUGHS] No, I didn't mean your face. You've got a very pretty face. Excuse me. Hey, Father, look... You don't have to call me Father. Greg. Okay, Greg. And please don't get all rigid on me. But I think I better talk to you about Estella. I took her over to the Mission Clinic. Doctor told me she doesn't have any business having a baby. She's 15 years old. She's in poor health and she's got a narrow pelvis. He says she's got one chance in 55 of having a normal delivery. You're talking about abortion. That's right. I know how the church stands on that. Well, it's less a question of what the church says. More question of what the psychological effect would be on these two people. You're talking about Estella Rios and her mother. Not Pamela Gibson. These people would feel... They'd feel as though they were committing murder. Well, that's the way you want them to feel, isn't it? No, I assure you that's not the way I want them to feel. But that is the way they would feel. This doesn't make any sense to me. Maybe. Maybe. Thanks for the drink. Do you have to go?Yes. I'll let you know how it goes with Estella. Please do. Can I drive you home? Uh, no, thank you. The walk will do me good. Good night, Greg.Good night. BOY: And I was disobedient to my teacher twice. I had impure thoughts, 11 times, Father. And I masturbated six times, Father. GREGORY: Don't be too discouraged about those impure thoughts and you can be a little more obedient to your teacher, can't you? BOY: I will, Father. GREGORY: And about that masturbation. BOY: Yes, Father. Keep yourself busy. Active, you know, sports. Father, I'm on the soccer team. I'm so tired after practice I can hardly do my homework. And even then you get this urge. Yes, Father. Have you been praying to stop the habit? Oh, yes, Father. You get this urge while you're playing soccer? No, Father. Well, try praying as hard as you play soccer. I don't know what to do, Father. It's breaking up our marriage. We both want to, but... He won't just as long as there is a chance of having another one. Six, Father. I mean we just can't have anymore. We can't afford to. Have you tried rhythm? Tried... Forgive me, Father, we had Billy and Irene with it. It just doesn't work for me. Father, how about the pill? He's gonna get himself another woman one day, if he hasn't already. You know, Margaret, there's a lot of controversy about the pill, even in the church. Quite a few of us believe that the use of the pill should be a matter of individual conscience. You mean it's all right? Well, if it's a question of keeping a family and a marriage together and you feel that it is the only solution for you. But Father Schaeffer says that it's absolutely not. Under no circumstances. Only two Sundays ago in his sermon... Well, yes, that's his opinion. And the word from Rome. Yes, I know. What am I supposed to do? You must make your own decision, Margaret. If I listen to you, I go against Father Schaeffer. And Rome. Eventually there will be agreement in the church. Eventually? Father, I'm talking about tonight. We try to be a good Catholic family, Father. Yes, I'm sure you do, Margaret. But you make it very hard. Have you got an idea for a speaker for next month's Holy Name meeting? Uh, no, I haven't, Paul. I asked you a week ago to give it some thought. Well, it slipped my mind, I'm sorry. Well, don't get one of those civil rights guys like last month. The announcements should go out in the bulletin in the next few days. [DOORBELL RINGS] All right, I'll get in touch with someone today. I don't know how you can stand to read the newspaper. There's nothing in it but strikes, wars, rapes. Immorality. I'm reading the funnies, Paul. Even the comics are full of sex these days. Excuse me, Father Lind, there's a Mrs. Rios who's here to see you. I told her you were having... No, it's quite all right. Thank you. Mrs. Rios. I'm sorry, Father. Excuse me for coming here. Oh, no, don't be silly. I'm pleased that you came. Now, what's wrong, Mrs. Rios? That Mrs. Gibson. She came over yesterday and took Estella away the whole afternoon. I think she wants Estella to not have the baby. Estella's all right, isn't she? Yes, Father. But I do not want her to see Estella. I'm afraid to say it to her. Well, she won't harm Estella, Mrs. Rios. Please, Father, tell that woman to stay away. Estella listens to her. Mrs. Gibson is really trying to help Estella. But if you'd like me to speak with her, well, yes, I will. Thank you, Father. Thank you. You're very welcome. Everything's gonna be fine, Mrs. Rios. Thank you, Father. Thank you. Goodbye. Who was that? A woman having a problem with her daughter. Doesn't sound like she's from this parish. She's not. You see, I told you. Once you start with those people. GREGORY: Those people? Come on, Paul. [INAUDIBLE] PAMELA: You want a little chili? Come on, eat. Why does an elephant carry keys? BOY: To open his trunk. How come, Robert? What? What is it? Come on, tell them. What? ROBERT: Uh, uh, uh, uh... Uh, uh, uh, uh. [PAMELA LAUGHING] [ALL LAUGHING] That's really bad, here eat this. Hello. Hi. Hi, I want to talk to you. Please. Sit down. All right. GREGORY: Who are these children? I'd like you to meet them. Children, Father Lind. GREGORY: Hi. Please, sit down. Thank you. Go on eat, he's not going to bite you. Would you like some chili? No, thanks. Are you her father? Her father? No, I'm not her father. Is he your husband? No. Is he your boyfriend? Wrong again, now eat. Mr. Rose will be by to take you all home in about 10 minutes. So eat up. Look here. You've upset Mrs. Rios. Me? Yeah. You took Estella away for a couple of hours the other day. So? So Mrs. Rios thinks you're trying to talk Estella into having an abortion. So this isn't just a social visit, huh? No, it isn't. Look, I know your intentions are good, Pamela. Thank you. But you don't understand these people. And you do? Yeah. Look, I think it would be a good idea if you just didn't go over there anymore. I think it would be a good idea if you butted out of my business. It's not just your business. What's your problem? [ALL GIGGLING] What's the matter? [WHISPERING] America says that by the way you talk to me you must be my husband. [ALL GIGGLING] I knew when I started this thing I was going to step on some toes. I can't help that. I can only do what I think is right. I'm sure you operate the same way. Look, I just said that in this case you are unnerving a mother and probably the daughter, too. Maybe they need a little unnerving. I came to this thing, helping other people, a little late in life. I'm hooked on it. I think I'm good at it. And I don't appreciate big brother telling me that I don't know what the hell I'm doing. When I was a kid my daddy took me to the ice follies. I saw those pros gliding and sliding around. It was the greatest thing I ever saw. So the next day I went out and rented myself some skates. Fell flat on my rear end. I might be dense, but I don't get it. Wanting to do something and knowing how are two different things. I think you just wanted to tell me you were once a kid who had a father who took him to the ice follies. Maybe. Look, can I drop you anywhere? No, I've got to get some work cleaned up. Thanks. Sorry if I've upset you. I'm a big girl, Greg. Bye-bye. PAUL: ♪ Where is my wandering boy tonight ♪ The boy who once was my joy in life ♪ The child of my love and prayer ♪ Oh, where is my boy tonight ♪ Oh, where is my boy tonight MAN: Come on, Paul. ♪ My heart overflows, for I love him, he knows ♪ Oh, where is my boy tonight Come on. Here we go. ♪ Once he was pure as the morning ♪ As he knelt at his mother's knee ♪ Oh, good evening, Gregory. Francis, Gregory's not a sympathetic person. Oh, I'm sure he is, Paul. No, no, no, no. Gregory is a damn prig. Notice I said prig. Yes, I noticed. I noticed. You're a prig yourself, Francis. Only Gregory is the biggest prig of them all. Come on. Come on, Paul, you're almost there. Just one more door. Hang on. Leave me alone. It's my room. It's the only private thing I have. My room. I don't want anybody in here. All right, Paul. Good night, Francis. Good night, Gregory. The weather report for tomorrow is on the negative side. Where did you find him? He was having dinner with his friend Commerford. Commerford called me. He knows that Paul and I go a way back. Nobody saw him that way. That makes it all right? Well, it's human. Yeah, but we ought to be a little better that human, Frank. Well, human or not. There are a whole lot of families in this parish that would rather see his face in the door than yours. Well, I'll let you get to bed. Well, you'll have to take his mass in the morning. Nah, he'll make it, he's tough. But I can respect him for it. Well, good night, Gregory. Take care. OFFICER: When I retire they can all run wild. I'm gonna go back to the reservations and cover my teepee with a bow and arrow and I'm gonna shoot anything that moves. But as long as I'm being paid to pick them up, I'm gonna pick 'em up whether they're Catholics, Baptists or heathens. Have I ever asked you to treat my people differently than the others? You bet you have. Well, there's no harm in trying is there? It makes me nervous. I get to thinking that your medicine man is more powerful than my medicine man. MAN: Nothing. I been around you guys. Thanks. OFFICER: What's your name? You go to hell. What's your name? You get nothin' from me. Put your hand up here. Pot? CHARLIE: No, Father. Acid? Yes, Father. Jerk? Yes, Father. How long? Couple of years on and off. Never got busted before. Congratulations, you're a winner. Everybody's on something, Father. But you got busted. That means you got a big black "J" for jerk by your name for the rest of your life. That means if you ever wanted to be something like, a doctor or lawyer you can't. I can always be a priest, Father. Don't get smart, Jerk. Look, I am getting you off. Talked to the Judge. Juvenile offender treatment. No record. Gee, thanks, Father. Yeah, this time. Next time you can rot in jail. And I want you down to Guadalupe House tomorrow. I want you there every day from now on. I'm gonna have Sister Elizabeth Grace looking at those big brown eyes of yours. If she suspects you're on something, Charlie, I'm gonna come down personally and kick your ass. You got it? Maybe I won't use it again, Father. Yeah, maybe you will, Charlie. Hey, Father, you forgot something. You didn't talk about God. Don't tell me my business, Charlie. You're in a cell, I'm not. MRS. RIOS: Father, she's dying, help her Father. Help her, Father. [SIREN WAILING] [MURMURING] God's will. It's God's will. Let's go sit. She's much better off here. They'll take good care of her. She's lost a lot of blood. We're trying to replace that. It all depends on whether we can stop the bleeding. Where is she? She's right there. Estella. I'm going to die. No. No, you're not, Estella. I had the oil. That doesn't mean anything. You're not going to die. Do you hear me? You're not going to die, Estella. You'll have to leave now. She started to hemorrhage early but apparently she's awfully scared because she didn't say anything till the pain got so bad. Damn it, damn it! She's rejected the fetus. I have given her something to stop the bleeding. She's not very strong. There's nothing to do now but wait. Is that her mother? Yeah. Mrs. Rios. Your daughter's had a miscarriage. Estella. Estella. [SHOUTING IN SPANISH] [CRYING] Doctor gave Mrs. Rios something to knock her out. She's lying down. And all for what? For nothing. You with your oil and your incense. People like the Rios's live in the Dark Ages. People like you keep them there. What's the sense in arguing? What's the sense in her dying? And don't tell me about God's will. Look, I care as much about Estella Rios as you do, maybe more, but Estella and Romundo created a human life. They made love, Gregory. Yeah, they did that, too. Do you think about creating a human life when you make love? Oh, come on. Good looking man like you. You trying to tell me you don't have a little nun or pious widow tucked away somewhere? What I do or don't do is none of your business, is it? When a human life is created nobody, nobody has a right to casually interfere with that. That's a lot of crap. What do you want from me? She stopped hemorrhaging. She's still not in great shape. But she'll pull through. That's good, Doc. You better get her home. Want some coffee or something? No. No, thanks. I'm sorry about some of the things I said to you tonight. Oh! That's all right. [CRYING] It's just that... [WHISPERING] You asleep. Hey? Hmm. You asleep? Not anymore. Hey. Hmm? Hey, what's that supposed to be? What does it look like to you? An Eskimo funeral procession. Greg, excuse me. I could sleep for a week. It's not an Eskimo funeral procession. It's an Eskimo wedding procession. Right. Are you humoring me? Right. You think you're pretty smart, don't you? Right. You're not smart, you're dumb. But you're very pretty. Gregory? Hmm. Where have you been? I went to the hospital, Paul. The Rios girl had a miscarriage. You've been out all night, Gregory. Yeah. I'll take your 8:00. Thanks, Paul, it's all right. I'll take my own 8:00. WOMAN: You are so good, Gregory. GREGORY: Yeah... MAN: To serve God one must put aside the petty satisfactions of this world. The temporal pleasures. That's why one comes to retreat. Renewal. Didn't Saint Peter say the more you go among men, the lesser man you become. Ah, but I don't know what that means now. It's all very clear, Father. Very clear. Our communion is with Christ not with any human being. But Christ loved human beings. The spirit. Spirit, that is the essence. I'm sure that in your few days here, you'll strengthen the faith that brought you to us. Well, is there anything else? No, thank you, Father. Gregory, you look terrible. It's the fasting. I could never do it. If men were meant to fast God wouldn't have given us an appetite. There are all kinds of appetites, Frank. Have you had your session with old Father Theodore yet? Yes. Amazing, isn't he? Every cliche in the book. Frank, I want to talk to you. Gregory, I talked to the Bishop about your transfer. The problem is there's nothing really suitable for you right now. There are better things coming along. Soon too. So, why don't we let things go as they are for the time being. Just do the best you can. You know you ought to get to know the Bishop better. Remarkable person. Maybe next week the three of us will get together for dinner. [ORGAN PLAYING] GREGORY: Father, I ask to be admitted into the life that serves the word of God, whose only son Jesus Christ. I consecrate my life to the only true internal church. And accept your teachings with all my heart and soul. [PHONE RINGS] Now tomorrow you have to see Dr. Harbor. Here's the address, can someone take you there? My sister has a car.Good. Leo Rose here. Right. It's for you. Mr. Right back from The Cloisters. Thanks a lot. Greg? Did I miss you. I missed you, too, Greg. Listen, I want to see you tonight. Maybe how's after 9:00? Are you all right? Your voice sounds funny. Yeah... [SIGHS] I'm in the rectory. Look, this week isn't so good. Leo's wife is sick and I'm working evenings. How about when you finish? Well, I made some plans. I didn't know when you were coming back, you know. Sorry. I guess I should have written or called. I told you I didn't know the rules. It's not the rules. It's just that maybe we ought to see how we feel about each other. I wanna see you. Well, maybe when things clear up, all right? Look, I'll try. PAUL: Do you know what little Michael said to me at choir practice today? "Father Schaeffer," he said, "you're always calling me a little angel. "Do you know there are many different kinds of angels?" "Of course," I said, "Michael, there are the Seraphim, the Cherubim. [PHONE RINGING] "The Thrones, Dominations and Principalities, "Powers, Virtues, Archangels and angels." Hello. "And what kind of angel am I?" The little monster asks me. Well, can you imagine? Father Lind, there's a Mrs. Gibson on the phone. I'll take it. Hello. Yeah. I think that will be fine. I'll let you know if there's any problem. Okay. Bye. Well, as I was saying, after I recited the order of angels for little Michael, he asked me what kind of angel he was. "A Seraphim." I said. [LAUGHING] "The very highest order." Do you know the little monster was as good as gold for the rest of the day. Paul, it's remarkable how you manage to remember all that. About the angels. What time is it? It's early and it's a very beautiful day. ♪ Little boy lost ♪ In search of little boy found ♪ You go on wondering, wandering ♪ Stumbling, tumbling round, round ♪ When will you find ♪ What's on the tip of your mind ♪ Why are you blind ♪ To all you ever were ♪ Never were, really are, nearly are ♪ Little boy false ♪ In search of little boy true ♪ Will you be ever done traveling ♪ Always unraveling you ♪ You ♪ Running away ♪ Could lead you further astray ♪ And as for fishing in streams ♪ For pieces of dreams ♪ Those pieces will never fit ♪ What is the sense of it ♪ Little boy blue ♪ Don't let your little sheep roam ♪ It's time, come blow your horn ♪ Meet the morn, look and see ♪ Can you be far ♪ From home PAMELA: He drank. He wouldn't touch me, so I started parading around the house in the nude hoping he'd notice me. One day I was taking the garbage out and I saw I didn't have any clothes on. That's when I figured the marriage was in bad shape. He must have been blind. Oh, I'm sorry, girls. Always keep to your right. I said, I'm sorry. Everyone knows you're supposed to keep to the right. [LAUGHS] I'll never forget. I saw you flirting with those girls. Am I really supposed to keep to the right? Everyone knows that. What do you think? Well, it looks like a lot. What is it?

Quiet. GREGORY: Maybe you ought to think about getting out of there. ANNE: I like things quiet. This house is too much. She claims she keeps it to make a home for me. Not that I could tell her, but I hate the damn place. New place to live, new people, new job, that's what you need. Too late. Much too late. Mother. Mother. ANNE: Mother. Mother. Gregory, I didn't hear the car. Oh, Greg, it's so good to see you. It's so good to see you. I missed you, too, Mother. It's so difficult these days, Gregory, everything's changed. Nobody believes in anything. Young people have no respect. Riots, sit-ins, drugs, makes me sick to look around. Thank God I have you and Anne. Otherwise I don't think I could go on. Mother, maybe you should think about giving up this house. Why? Well, maybe it's just too big. Well, I'll never leave this house, Gregory. This is where I raised you two. This is all I ever had after he deserted me. That was a long time ago. He tried to destroy me with his drinking and his women. But you're here and he's gone. Shall we drop it? You don't know what it was like. Right up until the day he died. I couldn't have gone on, if God hadn't given me you, a priest. Mother, what if I hadn't been a priest? Well, that's ridiculous question, Greg. It isn't ridiculous. Mother, I've been doing some thinking about the priesthood. Right now, I'm not sure I am a priest. Gregory. Things are happening. Gregory. That's the reason I've come home to talk to you. But, it's all I have, Gregory. It's all I have. Mother. From the moment you were born. Mother, please. You were the most spiritual child, the most godly. There was only good in you. That's not true.Yes, only good. Only thoughts of God and service to Christ. Mother, I had the usual thoughts of any child. No, you were different. You were better. And I was blessed. You grew up and fulfilled every hope I ever had for you. In the high school, in the seminary. Every teacher, every priest said it. You were destined to serve the church in the deepest, fullest way! Gregory, you are a priest. You are a priest! I don't know, Mother. Oh... I've had so many disappointments. Don't disappoint me, too. [CRYING] You almost killed her. I don't wanna talk about it, all right? All right. But just one more thing. In this sick, stupid, world it was nice thinking there was someone who really knew what he was doing. And that someone was your brother. That's not fair, Anne. Fair? Aren't you coming? I can't. I wouldn't know what to say to him. All right, go on home, I'll take a bus. WOMAN: I like historical movies, about real people. Kings and queens. I mean real queens. Not the kind that come in here. I like Dean Martin. Do you like Dean Martin? I don't see many movies. You watch a lot of television, huh? No. Uh, listen, unless you buy me another drink, I'm gonna have to split. I'm sorry.It's all right. Hello. Would you... Would you excuse me, please? Yes. Joe, scotch and a beer for him and the same for me. [PHONE RINGING] WOMAN: Operator here. Operator. I'd like to make a long distance phone call please to Albuquerque. Mrs. Pamela Gibson, person to person, please. 6-4-3-6-6-5-6. WOMAN: Do you have the area code? 5-0-5. Thank you. One moment please. PAMELA: Hello. WOMAN: Yes, I have a long distance call for Mrs. Pamela Gibson. Is this Mrs. Gibson? Yes, I'm Pamela Gibson. One moment. Please deposit $2.40 for the first three minutes. Hello. Hello? Sir, your party is on the line. Please deposit $2.40. Hello, hello? The line is still open. Will you hold on a moment? Sir, sir, I have your party on the line. So, this guy called the waiter over and he says, "Hey, waiter, what's that fly doing in my soup?" Well, the waiter looks in his soup and he says, "The breast stroke." [LAUGHS] You get it? The breast stroke. Then he orders his desert and he calls the waiter over to the table again and he says, "Hey, waiter, what's that fly doing on my ice cream?" Skiing. You heard it? Hmm. That's the lowest dress I ever saw. Do you like it? Don't your tits get cold in there? Tits? Watch your language. What's the matter with tits? It's in the Bible. I don't like dirty talk. I thought you were a gentleman. No, not me. Uh-uh. What do you say we get out of here? Go to my place. It won't cost you very much. And if there's something special you like to do, just ask. A lot of guys are afraid to ask. But if it's not too far out I'd be glad to oblige. I got to go. Hey, you say something to me? No, I didn't say anything. Hey, Charlie, this guy is trying to proposition me. No kidding? Yeah. They shouldn't let guys like that loose. Hey, where you going? Fag. One thing I can't stand, it's a fag. [COUGHING] WOMAN: You're so good, Gregory. GREGORY: Deny the flesh, boy. Flesh is the devil's tool. Deny the flesh, boy, deny the flesh. Can I help you? No. Look, you need a meal, place to sleep? It doesn't matter if you're a Catholic or not. I'm a Catholic, Father. GREGORY: But am I a priest, that's what I don't know. I used to know who I was, what I was doing. FRANK: What you need, Gregory, is hard work. I want you to go back into that parish and buckle down. I can't do that, Frank. Buckle down! I've some projects I can use your help on. What? To weave baskets and string beads to keep my hands busy, too, huh, Frank? You're indulging yourself, Greg. I go to get away from that parish. Get away? Get away where? I don't know, I just... I need a leave of absence. I have to know why! Because I need it. Isn't that good enough? All right, Greg. I think you're making a big mistake, but if that's what you want. That's what I need. Let me know where you are. I care very deeply about you, Greg. We all do. Don't forget that. You'll be back, sooner than you think. Lind, Gregory Lind. You left a lot of blank spaces. Well, some of the questions seemed irrelevant. Irrelevant? That's a big word, I'm impressed. You don't give a local address for Santa Fe. I'm looking for a place. So right now I'm staying at 204 Las Terrace. Now you put down here that you're looking for a job with kids. Teaching, counseling and under experience you put five years. Five years where? Five years, I have been counseling for five years. You can take my word for it. Well, people hire other people on the basis of background and experience. If you're not willing to be more specific about it just forget the whole thing. My mistake, I'm sorry. Greg. You're one of two things. You're either an ex con or an ex priest. Now level with me. Priest, but not ex. I'm on a leave of absence. Better if you were an ex-con. No one wants the church on his neck. I'm on a leave of absence. My dioceses knows all about it. Okay, I think I can get you something. But better keep quiet about the collar. [DOORBELL RINGS] Mrs. Gibson? I'm Monsignor Hurley, head of the chancery here. Oh, yes, I've heard of you. I seem to have gotten you out of the tub, I'm sorry. That's quite all right, I had to answer the doorbell anyway. That's not very funny, is it? Won't you come in? Yes, thank you. I should have called, but I was driving past your house and it occurred to me that this might be a good time for us to meet. Mistaken assumption, it appears. Actually, I had nothing planned for the evening except a few hours of Mozart. Do you like a drink, Monsignor? Yes, thank you. Bourbon, if you have it. Otherwise anything. Bourbon it is. Very attractive apartment. These modern painters, it takes time to acquire a taste for them. Sure. Like taking olives out of the bottle. The first one's a real bitch. Why did you come to see me, Monsignor? Well, the diocese is aware of the work that you and Mr. Rose are doing on Wells Street. Gregory.I beg your pardon. You came to see me about Gregory Lind. Well, you're wasting your time. I don't know where he is. But I do, Mrs. Gibson, he's in Santa Fe. Working in the hospital there. A rather menial job, I'm afraid. Certainly not commensurate with his ability. He's a very unusual young man. Don't you agree? Do you really care what I think about Gregory Lind? Very much. Yes, unusual. Gregory Lind is a priest with a bright future in the service of humanity. Unfortunately, however, he's been undergoing a a grave spiritual crisis. Well, it's the first time I've ever been called a grave spiritual crisis. You're very frank, Mrs. Gibson. One of us has to be or we'll be here all week, Monsignor. Look, I like Gregory Lind. I might even love him. What's happening to Gregory would've happened to him whether I came along or not. I don't believe that and I don't think you do. Give him up, Mrs. Gibson. How can I? I don't have him. Neither do we. It's the cruelty of it, isn't it? Mrs. Gibson, priests have been leaving the church for 2,000 years. The church will survive. Then why are you making this pitch? I care about the survival of Gregory Lind. Do you? Yes. But first and foremost I care about my own survival. It's a natural instinct, isn't it? Yes. Vey natural. Thank you for the bourbon. I won't keep you from your music. I'm quite sure that anyone as attractive as you doesn't have many evenings for Mozart. I'm quite sure you hope I don't, Monsignor. [SIREN WAILING] [MOANING] Can I help you? I'm a priest. Is there anything I can do? What's the matter with you, Greg? Come on, get with it. Greg. There was somebody here looking for you. She said she'd be back. Which way did she go? She went out the rear exit. How'd you find me? Woman's intuition. And Monsignor Hurley came by to see me. A pair of discarded mistresses comparing notes over a cup of bourbon. He did, huh? What are you doing at the hospital? Driving an ambulance. Are you good at it? Not bad. Do you still go to mass? Every day. Are you functioning as a priest? No, you know I don't. Do you have any friends here? None to speak of. Women? No. Do you want to knock off the catechism? Just trying to find out where you are. I'm in Santa Fe. You, my friend, are in limbo. I'm on a leave of absence. So that's your name for it. Okay. Look, I had to get away. Get away from you, get away from the parish. I needed some distance. Some perspective, that's what I needed. Of course, I'm not doing anything around here. Maybe you're right, maybe it is limbo. Look, could you be seriously involved with someone, who is still in love with the church and would probably always belong in part to the church? Could I? You subjunctive son of a bitch! I'm not interested in hypothetical men, Greg. Yeah, you marry real men, you get real divorces. Don't exaggerate. One man and one divorce. All I'm trying to find out from you... I know what you're trying to find out. If you leave the priesthood, leave because you can't live that way anymore. Leave because you have to. Don't ask me to tell you what to do. Damn it, I'm entitled to know a couple of things from you. You're entitled to nothing. If you want a guarantee, go out and buy a Mickey Mouse watch. You're crazy. Sure I am. What the hell is the matter with you? What do you think is the matter with me? Get out of my life. I was never in it. I don't need you. I don't want you. You're right. I can't stay here. MRS. TIETGENS: Father, welcome home. Thank you very much, Mrs. Tietgens. How are you? Fine, thank you. PAUL: Who's that? It's Father Lind, Father. Oh, thank goodness, you're back. There are a million things to do. All right, I'll just... I'll just unpack, Father. [CHILDREN CHATTERING] WOMAN: It's a very lonely life, Father. Nobody cares whether I live or die. But I have tried be a good person... And I can't sleep. I've spoken to him about it several times. But yesterday when I met him on the stairs, I mentioned it to him again and he told me to go to hell! Well, I lost my temper. And I told him that he... After all the dog is a dumb animal and not responsible. And anyhow I'm not sure there is a hell for animals. I'm sorry I condemned the dog, Father. Try, uh, to keep your mind free of such thoughts. Didn't he get what was coming to him, Father? Could you give me an answer, Father? BOY: I got the ball. PAUL: You can't go on like this, Gregory. You can't go on. Down again this week. And down every week, for the past three months. They've got time for everything on Sunday. Time for the country club, time for barbecue spareribs, clog up our highways, but they've got no time to go to church. Gregory, we are going to attack this problem head on. You and I are going to visit every family in this parish. And give them all a little goose. We'll split the parish in half geographically, the north and south. I'll take the south end, you take the north. Or would you rather have the south end? Doesn't matter. Of course it matters, Gregory. Look, look here. Gregory, here. You are better known in the north than in the south, aren't you? I have no idea, Paul. Well, I still think I should take the south area although there are some families I feel I should call on up here in the north zone. All the Gibbons and the Waylons, don't you think? Yeah, I guess so. And there are some families you'll want to call on here in the south end too, aren't there? Aren't there, Gregory? Gregory, am I boring you? No more than usual, Paul. What? I'm sorry. Look, I'm just not in the mood. What are you in the mood for? A visit to Wells Street? A call on a sympathetic lady? Shut up, Paul. You're a disgrace. In the old days you would have been publicly defrocked. But now, we have to feel sorry for you. You and that damned whore. Paul, damn it, just shut up! Why don't you hit me, Gregory? You're a sick old fool. Which of us is sicker, Gregory? Answer me. Which of us is sicker?

"Brethren, I plead with you, "I a prisoner for the Lord, "to live a life of worthy of the calling you have received. "With perfect humility and meekness "and with patience. "Supporting one another lovingly." MRS. TIETGENS: Father. Father. Father. Yes. The car is here. Thank you. Father Lind? Right this way, please. Yes. Thank you. Come in. Come in, Gregory, come in. Sit down. Well... I want to leave the priesthood, Your Grace. I must tell you, Gregory, hearing these words from you breaks my heart. I've given it a great deal of thought, Your Grace. I'm sure you have. Monsignor Hurley tells me that you've been deeply troubled. It's is celibacy thing I suppose. That's part of it. Gregory, you took your vows. You knew that celibacy would be required of you. I was one person then, I'm quite another person now, Your Grace. You've met this remarkable woman. Oh, every man feels this way once or more in his life. I assure you that feeling will pass. No, I don't think so. Lovely, romantic. This remarkable woman is just another human being. At the moment, you see her magnificence, but in time, you'll see frailties. I see them now, Your Grace. And I love her. Do you? Too bad you can't have the same regard for the church. I love the church, Your Grace. I want to stay in the church. I would like to serve the church, but not as a priest. The rules of the church make that impossible. The rules of the church are the truths of the church as affirmed by the Pope. You can't mean that, Your Grace. The Pope is a man. He doesn't claim complete infallibility. I think he's wrong in certain areas. Social issues, birth control, priestly celibacy... That's enough, Gregory. I'm not looking for excuses for myself, Your Grace. I'm aware of that. Priests are marching on picket lines. Priests are encouraging racial violence. Priests are demanding change. Well, everybody's clamoring for change. People find their institutions less than perfect. In their disappointment they seek to destroy it. Governments, schools, universities, the family, the Church. But, Gregory, in this world of whirlwind change, man needs something that does not change. Something that is a bastion against temporal whim and caprice. The principles of the church remain eternal. I agree, Your Grace. Love is a principle, priestly celibacy is an irrelevant application of that principle. So, you petition me for release from your vows. Yes. You realize, of course, that your petition must be sent to Rome for an approval. It will take some time. I was hoping that you could expedite it. I myself will have to look it over very carefully before sending it on. We'll have to examine the state of your mind. There will be conversations between you and Monsignor Hurley. Oh, it'll take six months at least before I could take any sort of action. No. What? There's another person involved, Your Grace, I can't let her hang. Gregory, don't you realize that it means immediate ex-communication if you marry before being released from the priesthood? Then approve my petition quickly and help me get a favorable answer from Rome, Your Grace. No, no, Gregory. I love you too much to make things so easy for you. You think this easy for me, Your Grace? Gregory, you can't have it both ways. The woman and the church. The church loves you. If you love the church, obey its rules. Some rules are good, others are not. The time when people obeyed them blindly is gone, Your Grace. But there will be a change some day. The celibacy thing will change in time. In time? I told practically the same thing to one of my parishioners about birth control. She said to me, "Father, in time? I'm talking about tonight." We've all waited for different things, Your Grace. I can't wait any longer. MAN: One God and Father of all. Who is over all. And works through all, and is in us all. Who is blessed forever, Amen. Lord be with you. I quote from Saint Matthew, 19:12. "There are eunuchs who have made themselves such "that a kingdom of heaven sake." And I'm asking myself what do these words of the Lord mean? Do they demand that a man become a eunuch, that he give up ordinary human needs and desires in order to serve God fully? Can only a eunuch understand the conditions of ordinary men? Can he weep with a man when a child, the fruit of that man's loins, is lost? Can he rejoice when a man and a woman become as one? There are some who find the world of a eunuch a rewarding and a fruitful and an authentic way of Christian life. But for others, in the first epistle to the Corinthians, St. Paul says, "Each man has his own gift from God." Some in this way, and others in that. Pamela. It's done. I've left. What's the matter?
