Goodbye, Boys There once lived three comrades... ...around the Narvskaya estate in St Petersburg. One died at the factory... Another was hanged... And the third... What parasites. Nowhere to fix a stove in this town, and they're here dancing. Away with the parasites! I was 18 back then. And my Inka wasn't yet 17. Volod, what are you being quiet for? It's obvious, like 2 plus 2 is 4. Socialism is complete freedom for all. Everyone gets the same right to build a communist society. It's interesting how popes will build communism. Well... The pope is an exception. Churches are separate from the government. Whatever, to hell with the pope. Can Tinsmith be chosen? Only those who deserve the trust of the people can choose. Any questions? It's logic. I've always said that Volodka is a thinker. Tinsmith and the like should be drowned at sea, not given rights. No need to drown him. He'll die on his own. There we are then. It's settled. Here, Zhen. Read. Let's continue. Our constitution... It's the most democratic constitution because it insures rights. Right to holidays, to work, Right to a pension in old age, or in the case of illness or loss of work. Our constitution is the most democratic because every USSR citizen is guaranteed: A, freedom of speech. B - freedom of print, C - freedom to unite. Everyone in the same place, right? Onegin was surplus to requirements. The wind turned the page. The wind is in your head. No, it's true. It's true. Do you know how much I read? See how much I've read through. I have the whole day tomorrow. It doesn't matter. Did you understand what the draft officer said? We're not trying to export the revolution, but abroad... The enemies dream of restoring the old rules in our country. They're getting ready to attack us. The old commanders can no longer match the spirited expectations of soldiers. So, it is you... who will lead the army of the pioneering working class government. The Komsomol is leader in delivering the five-year plan. The Komsomol should be the leader in the army. That's why we came to you, the best of the best, with the invitation to go to military school. Think about it. You'll be lieutenants in three years. Now you know why we invited you. It's up to you. Your eligibility has been confirmed at the top. We'll wait. Decide. Let's assume that I agree. I say yes and... I come home and my parents say no. You're 18 years of age, Krigger. Think of how, at your age, Komsomol boys went to war. Remind your parents of that. Although, it seems your parents weren't in the Komsomol. I'll say yes, and we'll persuade my parents together. I agree. Understood. That's Belov. Son of Nadezhda Alexandrovna. It's your turn, Anikin. I agree as well. I already know everything. I ran and ran across the whole town. Just think about it. You and dad are both army men. No, it's just that I didn't know I could become an army man. There's nothing to compare. Geologist or army man. Being a commander combines several professions. A teacher and an engineer. Can you imagine a modern military ship? The history of naval warfare. Who knows - maybe a Battle of Trafalgar will help us win the final battle for communism. A man is interesting because of his future and a woman because of her past. It's true. I read it in some book. What do you think the past is? I don't know. First you have the future and then it becomes the past. I think the future is more interesting. You'll be a lieutenant in three years. You'll be 21 and already a lieutenant. You'll live in Sevastopol or in Kronstadt. Or maybe in Vladivostok and I'll come to visit you. I thought that only happiness lay in front of me. How are you? Very good. Look at that. He's washed all the dishes. You are an absolute star and deserve a fantastic dinner. I'll fry you up a sausage omelette. Mom, you know, the Komsomol invited me to military school. Did you say something? They called us to the committee today. And the city must send three of the best Komsomol members. And that included me. I'll go and lie down. Mom, you promised that sausage omelette. Make it yourself, son. I'm a little tired. Mom. Mom, for the first time in my life, the Komsomol really needs me. Do I have to turn it down? Would you turn it down? Volodya, have you ever shaved? You've grown up. It's hard to recognise you with how much you've shot up this year. Is it noticeable? Very much so. My mom let me down. I trusted her and she let me down. - Understand? - Aha! I told mom everything first so that she would prepare dad. But she didn't prepare him. Dad came up to me, asks me, "Is it true?" I say, "yes," then he punched me. Punched you good. - Mom let me down. - I heard you. I trusted her and she let me down. What a nightmare. My dad woke me up three times during the night. He couldn't give mom her valerian himself. I was supposed to see how my mom suffered. Sasha! Sasha! My God. Where did he go? Where did he go? I'll probably lose my mind eventually. Hold him! - Murderer! - Why are you standing? Sonya, how old are you? What is it? Are you out of your mind? Don't you know how old I am? Let's say I do know. One thing I don't know is when you will understand what time we are living in. Sonechka, the government needs your son. It's his happiness, not ours. I wouldn't wish that on my enemies. Let this rascal and his communist mother take this happiness. Sonya! By the way, you're the rascal. You can tell your mom - she can stop trying to feed me with her sweet and sour stew. She can eat it herself. Don't even hope that I'll come to your place again. Wait a second. What do I have to do with this? I'm sick of the smell of valerian. Okay, Sashka. My mother didn't agree to it immediately either. You'll see Vitka yourself. Mom let me down. I trusted her and she let me down. Stop whining. We're adult enough. It doesn't change anything if our parents are against it. The main thing is to be able to use theoretical methods in practice. I like an optimist. They don't get black eyes. They're not woken up three times at night. They're good. What have you found? KING OF HAWAIIAN GUITAR JOHN DUNKER I bet you the real last name of this king is Pesyakhovich. And before they crowned him, he was Madam Fisher's butler in Kiev. How do you know about Madam Fisher? Here we are. You've never heard of Madam Fisher? You don't know that she had a haberdashery on Khreshchatyk Street? Do you at least know Khreshchatyk Street in Kiev? Sash, give it a rest. Madam Fisher branded collars were world-famous. Only someone so ignorant wouldn't know that. I have an idea. Go on. Let's hear it. Alyosha, you know us. We're modest people. We're not looking for fame. But if my mom reads tomorrow in the paper that her son is the best of the best... And the army can't be without him, she'll calm down. Not completely of course, but at least it'll be possible to live in the house. Well done, guys. Consider it done. - Hello, Ivan Ivanovich. - Hello. - Well, I'll head on up. - Hang on, Alyosha. - Vitkin's father will come to see you this evening. - Why's that? To get on your case. Nobody will get in the way of the political campaign. Especially this Stakhanovite. Pyotr Anikin. Praise for Pyotr Anikin's Stakhanovite brigade! Hello, Uncle Pete. - Did he greet us? - It didn't seem like it. Are you sure we're not going to leave here with black eyes? Volodka, Sashka! How are things? Nothing much. Wait! Zaitsev Brigade! 38 tonnes! Anikin Brigade! 40 tonnes! Hooray! And again! And again! Thank you, Anikin. Thanks for the initiative. What for, Gavrila Spiridonovich? It's the state we're working for, not you. Then I'm thanking you on behalf of the state. Well, if you have that kind of power, you may. - To good health, Andreevich. - Cheers, brigadier. Drink up. To good health. Come to the table, your majesties. I heard that some sort of king... ...has appeared in town. - Playing a balalaika or what? - Hawaiian guitar. Hawaiian. I haven't heard it. Us neither. We're planning to. Uncle Petr, I'm not an antisemite. No. But tell me... Why do Jewish parents interfere with their children's lives? Why are you asking me this? What do you mean? It's a nightmare. I don't know if Vitka told you about the military school. I told my parents. I told dad and mom that we are the best of the best. There isn't anyone else like us. This is why it's us who are being sent to military school. What then? My respected father grabs his belt... ...and my loving mother holds me by the arms. It's a nightmare. Meaning he couldn't deal with it himself? That's not the point. I'm ashamed in front of the town. Don't tell me Jewish fairytales here. See this? I don't need a belt and nobody has to hold your arms. When you're down, when your own parents poison your life. Where can you go? To a friend's dad. A leader. A Stakhanovite. What if this person doesn't get you? If he doesn't support you, but your backwards parents. What do I do then? What? What do they want from you, Andrey? Everything will be okay, Uncle Pete. You'll see. Okay. I'm seeing already. Dad is on overnight flights, and mom is on her own at home. Do you know how mom doesn't like it on her own at home? When dad is on overnight flights. I'll fall. That's the fourth floor. It's far away. A hero! Learn from him. At last, your nose became of use. He recognised you. Do you know Spinoza had that nose? Shall we swim? We swim every day. For this kind of day we need something outstanding. I don't know. My head hurts. Don't pay any attention to it. It's the cigarettes. Mine hurts too. Are you thinking of shaving? Will we go to Tartakovsky? Let's wait and see. Welcome. Future lieutenants? Yeah, yeah. - You're not a fan? - Why not? I wonder why lieutenants are not called poruchiki. The Red Army introduced the title, 'lieutenant'. This is exactly what I'm interested in. Why 'lieutenant' and not 'poruchik'. As I remember, the Tsar's Army had poruchiki and not lieutenants. Why do you mention the Tsar's Army? No reason. Relax. What is worth mentioning? Tell me. Why did they have to shoot colonels? In 1917. Firstly, the Red Army has commanders, not officers. Secondly, you don't have the first idea about this. I don't understand. Sure. Maybe I'd like to know... if any of this has ever occurred to you. Certificate of Excellence Would you like a massage? Massage? Massage. Of course. People should be beautiful in every way. - A. Chekhov A glass of young wine! 10 years of age! For them too? You think we're not people, don't you? Very well. Sun, grapes and health! Good? Not bad. Nectar! Another two or three events and Sashka will become an alcoholic. So what? Let's wait and see, like my dad says. I wish your dad would think of something new to say. So, professors, are you joining the navy? - Where else? - That's correct. - Another. - Good idea. - Drinking navy style. - What do you mean, navy-style? The one who invited the other pays up. Wait a minute. Let's drink together. A glass of young wine. 10 years of age. To their death. To whose death? Where did you dig them up from? Why are you embarrassing me, professors? Okay. Let's drink and then I'll explain. I don't drink without reason. There are always those who meddle with the lives of others, professors. An annoying skipper from the ship 'Poseidon' is meddling with his. So, to stop their meddling, it's better if they die. What a toast. One glass of wine, and a life free of worries over that. Let's drink to Tinsmith. Navy style, to his death. Seems promising. Professors, like I said. To their death. Come on, help yourselves. You've been drinking, Volodka. I have. So what? What's there to say? And you shaved. You're wearing cologne. How did you know that 'Red Mask' is for men? How do you know? I know everything. There is a pilot in my dad's squadron. He always smells of wine, tobacco and 'Red Mask'. Do you like it? How can I like him? He's already 30. He's almost the same age as my mom. That's all that's on your mind. I'm asking about the scent, not the pilot. Volodka, you smoke! You know, Volodka. When we marry, I will give you cognac in the mornings. You'll shave every morning and smell of 'Red Mask'. I tried my whole life to be like the pilot I never met. This is in the memory of you, Inka. A comrade leaves, to a far away land. The winds of home are carrying him, Beloved city, disappearing in the blue mist. Familiar house, green garden, soft glance. Beloved city, disappearing in the blue mist. Familiar house, green garden, soft glance. What's funny? I've known for a long time that you wanted to kiss me. If you want to kiss me again, don't stare at me. You don't need to say anything either. Just kiss me. Don't lecture me. I know it all. And anyway. One intimate question. Have you kissed Inka already? Have you kissed anyone? A gentleman doesn't kiss and tell. Just smiles vaguely. On a sunny beach in June, in her blue pyjamas. Not bad, huh? A cheeky little star of a girl, she's driving me crazy. I can see that. Why do you think that Vertinsky is degrading? It doesn't affect me either way. You think the songs don't affect you but, actually, they do. You don't notice it. Can you finally tell me what happened? They can do what they like. I'm not going. Not going where? You don't know, do you? To weed out the oats. - When do you need to go? - In two days, the message said. Why should I carry your shoes around? Don't, then. Just to warn you, I'll throw them into the sand. Go ahead. It's so hot but you won't swim. Sashka didn't let me. He told me to wait for you. Why are you stood like a statue? Let's go. We've got a job to do. Volod! Volodya! Come here a minute. Come closer. Are we going to eat ice cream after? We'll think it over. Stop whispering. Katya, don't swim without me. Can I take one dip? Look how hot it is. She's hot and I'm not. Okay. One little dip. You're such an Ali-Pasha. When a guy hasn't bathed the whole winter, it's not that easy to wash yourself clean. Vit. Shall we try? Okay. The man with you is deceiving you. How is he deceiving me? He is not the person he claims to be. My dear boy. It's not the worst kind of deception for women. I know he's no captain of the seas. But what difference does it make? If a person is drowning, they're on their own. Turkish delight! Rahat lokum, lokum rahat! However you'd like it. We're free at last. I will miss school. You can stay for another year. You must be mad. No - I'm going to medical institute. And when you're injured in the war, I'll heal you. What a mind. And heart. What a heart she has. We've just sat the final exam and she is already dreaming that one of us is injured. That's only if there is war. Where is Inka? How much can one person swim? Inka is lucky with famous people. She met John Dunker in the water. By the way, it's a rare sight - a king without his trousers. Something to behold. So that you don't stare. She's not swimming because she's covered in makeup. The next act in our lineup... ...is an illusionist Jacques. It's no miracle - everything is based on science and slight of hand. You are mesmerising today. Your back can drive a man wild. Just today? Don't twist my words. My right shoe is too small. I can't bear it. What a disgrace. Take it off. Let's hope your socks are clean. Disgrace. What a terribly rich vocabulary. And talking about a naked back isn't a disgrace? And when a man's shoe is too small, it is? A lesson for you. Don't be vulgar. I'm sorry. Not at all. But I'm comfortable like this. I'm not. John Dunker! Over the Pink Sea! Over the Pink Sea! I'm very sorry. Over the Pink Sea. Over the Pink Sea! Everyone in the audience was looking at you. I know. How? You weren't looking around. I only pretend not to look. In actual fact, I see everything. My eyes are made that way. I look forwards and see everything. How everyone is dressed and who looks at me. Give me the matches for a minute. I've read my fortune with matches three times already. It always worked. Not quite on the third time. Well, almost. See? We'll always be together. Do you see? Three years is better than five. You'll come back and we'll always be together. Will you come back? Have I told you? My mom's sister lives in Leningrad. Have I told you? I don't remember. I think you have. I know I can stay at hers in summer. It'll be good if they send you to Leningrad. And what else would be good, is if it would always be summer. Congratulations, comrades. You're going to Leningrad. Comrade Pereverzev. We'll talk to the boys directly. There is an order. Two places at Sklyansky's infantry school. One at the medical academy. Krigger. Didn't you want to study at the medical institute? It's as if this place was meant for you. Can anything be changed? What are you getting at? We grew up by the sea. We walk the length of the sea like we do in our apartment. Meaningful. There are many sea types like you. And only two navy institutes. Any other reasons? Snow white tunics, crabs and golden anchors embroidered on the cap. Am I right? I would also like to join the infantry school. We have been together since childhood. You can't stay together all your lives. That's okay. There's meat as long as there are bones. Don't speak ill of the infantry. The infantry commander is the commander in chief. The uniforms are just as good as in the navy. What's bad about my uniform, hmm? You need to be able to wear a uniform. Any questions? You're free to go. He's a clever man. Does it make you feel better? Of course it does. He's also an infantry major. I'm the lucky one in all of this. I feel like a complete asshole in front of you. You shouldn't. Neither me nor Vitka have any wish to become a doctor. Or maybe you do? I'd be a terrible doctor. After dissecting a frog at school, I was throwing up for two days. You'd begin to feel sick if you saw a frog now. Not as much now. We are lucky, come to think of it. This campaign could've started a year earlier or later. And we wouldn't have been involved. We'll sand it down and paint it. I wonder who will go out in it. Zhenya imagined me in a white tunic, meeting her after a concert. It's not just about the tunic. Vitka was killed in 1941 in Novo-Rzhev... Sashka died in Stalin's purges and was acquitted posthumously in 1956. Well, what shall we tell the girls? Let's go for a swim. Listen. So quiet. You know, Inka? I'm not going to the naval institute. Vitka and I are being sent to the infantry. I guess they need us more. It doesn't really make any difference. It's three years and not five, anyway. Inka. We're adults. Understand? Why are you telling me this? I can't leave you like this. You can think what you like about me. I can't. I... ...won't think anything. Let things be. WORK CREATED MAN! Students in the 9th grade of Postyshev Middle School... ...are ready to depart for the collective farm! Good to go. Get in the vehicles! Inka! Inka, don't, what's the matter? Inka, you know we're not allowed to leave the city. I haven't told anyone that I'm here. Don't, Inka. Stop crying. You know, when you cry, I want to hang myself. I want to hang myself too. Yesterday, Yurka told me off for not completing my task and today for being late. Is it my fault? Nobody will tell you off today. I'll leave on the evening train. We'll have done twice as much by then. You go ahead and I'll catch you up. It's better if I face you. You're not angry with me, are you? I've never been angry with you. Grab the weed closer to the root and don't pull, but yank it out. I do that but the root stays in. That's not how it should be, is it? Push your fingers deeper. Look. Like that and that's it. - Like that and that's it. - What does he want? Collective inspection. Don't mind him. Sashka called. Be on the spit by ten. They'll pick you up on a boat. What's happened? You're leaving tomorrow. They won't be able to reach the shore. I'll go out to them. I have this feeling. As if I'm to blame. Maybe I am. You're not to blame for anything. Please don't. - Have you thought about me? - All of the time. What were you thinking about? Don't, Inka. There's no way of telling you. I'll write to you. Volodka, hurry! I never saw mother again, not even dead... Goodbye, boys! THE END subs by matty5190 @ KG
