When talking about our ancestors, what sort of images comes to mind? I'm sure you're thinking of people half-naked. Or tools made of wood or leaves... Simplefolk with no material wealth. But did you know that when Western invaders first set foot in Mindanao during Magellan's expedition... According to Pigafetta, back then they didn't need to dig too deep to find gold as big as an egg. Every one of the Rajas' possessions were made of gold... Their dinner plates and earrings were made of gold... they even had gold in their teeth! A far cry from our usual image of the first Filipinos... What's that? Give it to me. Everyone has a story about their first sexual encounter. Thank you. You may sit down. Mine is pretty special since I'm already past 30 and I still haven't done it. Note: Is Sir Camaya still a virgin? Whose idea was this? I'm not going to get angry, I just want to talk. If no one comes forward, we're having a quiz. I knew it! I could tell it's Gopez just from the handwriting. Gopez, do you have a problem with virgins? [clears throat] Nothing, sir. Well, obviously, you care enough about it that you had to do a survey. It's just for fun, sir. Well, let's discuss it. I don't really care about your little survey, I just want to know what's running through your mind. Well, sir, see, if you're no longer a virgin, it's proof that someone likes you! But when you're getting old and you're still a virgin, that must mean nobody's interested. Did you know that when the Spaniards arrived they were so surprised at the sexual freedom women enjoyed? So you're still a virgin? Get one-fourth sheet of paper. We're having a quiz. Number one, what date did Magellan land on Homonhon Island? Ohh, someone's getting paid today! Aren't you going to treat us? Come on, Toto. How about beef with fried rice? Or what about Halo-halo? We're all getting paid today, why would I treat you? You're so stingy! Let's just go! - But just like love, - Renato, ma'am. - I'm not thinking about it constantly. - Renato Camaya. I guess I just don't like the idea of putting so much effort into romance. Not to mention all the expenses. The vendors of Angeles City confirmed the steady increase in the cost of commodities such as fruits, vegetables, meat, and fish. A kilo of tilapia that used to be at 115 pesos is now at 128 pesos. Son of a bitch. Prices just keep going up. So listen up, Letlet! Quit fooling around with boys! If you get knocked up early, you're dead! These costs will kill you! This again, mother? Mother, here's my pay. You got what you needed? Mm-hm. You know, if a fire started, your room would be the first to burn down. Mother, this is my only joy in life. Look at this one. It's Maria Clara. Son, don't take this the wrong way, but... I'm getting worried. You're past 30 and not once did you bring a girl... That's just how it is, mother. Life is hard, isn't that what you said? That lecture was for your sister! Because she's too young. Here, take this. I won it at the lottery today. Go out and eat. Ask out one of your female friends so you can develop feelings for each other. Go on. Then, when you don't get the girl... that's a hit on your pride! Don't you really have anyone to ask, bro? Not even your co-teachers? Nope. You're lucky that mother keeps pushing you to have a girlfriend. When it comes to me and Wiggie, she's way too strict! You know how mother is, books before boys. Wiggie and I are more responsible than you think! Believe what you want! Where are we eating? Let's have sisig by the rail road! Not bad for your 500 pesos. We already had dinner back home. Why would we waste the cash? Learn to save where you can. Mother said we should eat out! Mother said I should eat out with a female friend, not with my sister. Then why'd you ask me? No reason. You're crazy! At least give me money for the trike fare! I'll just go home! Just walk. It's not that far. You're the worst! But what if there was a place where you can easily find a partner? And for cheap, too! Area, sir? Are you looking for the Area? What 'Area'? Women, sir. Is this Area? Yeah, boss. This way. Bro, come on! Just take your pick, man. See if you like any of the girls inside. 300 pesos, bro. There's more over there. You into that? They'll finish soon. No, no! Bro, we're giving it for 250. How about 200? Is this your first time? I'm not looking to fuck! I'm a decent man! So why did you take a look? I was just curious! I can tell you stories about this place if you want. Hey! Candy! Where the hell have you been? We've been looking for you! I was just with a friend. That one's 700 pesos. He said 250 pesos. Candy's different. She's special. If you're not interested, can I get by? - I need to... - I only have 500 on me. Are you fucking kidding me? Look at what you're gonna rail, man! Does that look like your average meat? It's expensive... It's alright, TJ. Business is slow anyway. Fine, fine... Nevermind! I'm saving up. Sorry. Well? Are you guys ready to get your cherries popped? Hell yeah, man! I've been ready since last week! I didn't jack off for a week for this! Whip out your cocks coz we're not coming outta here as virgins! What do you want us to do? You said you would tell me stories. You thought I was serious? No, it's just... I'm a teacher. History teacher. What's the history of this place? Hell if I know? All that matters is what it is right now. A hotspot for broke-ass bums looking for a cheap... Hey, I'm not a bum. Then you should have gone to Fields! That's where people with money go. Fields? Let's just get this over with. Hey! What are you doing? Stop squirming! It's like giving a dog a bath! Your first time, huh? Mm-hm. Leave it to me, then. Ever been kissed on the lips? I love you! What the fuck? What was that? What? I love you' for a stupid kiss? Let's finish your initiation. Boss! Pay up! How was it? Perfect score! 10/10! With honors! I guess that's how it feels, huh? Simultaneously awkward and exciting. Funny how the things we otherwise find disgusting, like spit, and sweat, our private parts... During sex, they become delicious. Especially if you're doing it with a professional. - Toto, you're gonna be late! - Pass your papers forward! Right minus wrong! Hey! Wake up! What the hell? You're late! Morning! How odd! Sir Camaya is tardy! Did a new documentary keep you up last night, Toto? No, it's just insomnia. It's Madam Principal! Good morning, ma'am! Mr. Camaya! Are the rumors true? Students from Section B were questioning your virginity? I'm sorry? Just confirm if it's true. Because if it is, I'll send them to the guidance office. No need for that, ma'am! I gave them what they deserved: a surprise quiz! Besides, none of it's true. What do you mean? That I'm still a virgin. Please, ma'am, at my age? Let's not make it into an issue. Do not bring us to the test, but deliver us from evil. Amen. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Good morning, class. Good morning, Mr. Camaya! Read chapters 12 -15 in the textbook. We'll have a graded recitation in 40 minutes! Eat, work, sleep... Mostly, work... That's where my life used to revolved around in. But eversince I experienced Candy, I want to break free from the mundane. There's a part of me that thinks this is wrong But it just feels so good! Can't I give myself a break for once? Just from time to time. And it's not like I'll be doing this forever. Right? Yes, of course. This will pass. I promise. Ma! Can I borrow 500 pesos? Why? Didn't I give you last night? Didn't you say I should go out with a female friend so we can develop some feelings? And? Did you find someone? Letlet told me you didn't spend the 500 pesos. Ma... The truth is... I asked Stephanie out. Huh? That young lady from grade school who won Mr & Ms U.N. with you?! - Yes - Yes, mother... Goodness! You're a perfect match! She's so smart! But don't you think you're spending a bit much? 500 pesos every night? Can you keep up with that kind of expense? Come on, Ma... This is the last, Renato. If you want money to spend on your honey, you've got to do it with your own money. I already give you most of my pay. I dare you to try and live off your own, paying for food and utilities! Let's see how long you'll last on that salary of yours! Just kidding! Thank you, Ma! The one with the huge titties! Hey What are you doing here? And in your uniform, too! Nothing, sir! Just walking around! This is our usual route. I'm warning you, Gopez! I know what you're here for! Sir... It's Labot's birthday today. It'd be a sick present to have his first time here. We all chipped in for it! Sir! There's a girl in there... She's so pretty! So pearly and supple! My birthday wish is to be devirginized by her. That's our plan, sir. If you little runts don't go home, I'll tell the principal! Don't be a killjoy, sir. We're all men here! Why would you spend money just to get fucked? Can't score with any of the girls in your class, huh? That's because you're all ugly! Go home! Go home! That's messed up, sir. Let's just go. Sorry 'bout that, bud. Happy birthday! Is this all of it, Auntie Mariel? For the whole month? Well, yeah! Business is slow! Good evening. You know, in my two years of working here, not a single customer has greeted me. Most of the time, as soon as they enter, it's straight to fucking. Is that how it works? Can I strip now? Can you do it by yourself? Of course! Well, aren't you excited. Sorry! No, that's not it. I meant, two days in a row? You're something else. I really like you, Candy. If only I could be with you outside... in a different context. "Context"? Is that how you talk even when you're not in class? I'm telling you the truth! You just met me last night. You probably just like me because I was your first time. You have a point. But... we could try. Try what? To meet in a different context. Get dressed, hurry! We'll pretend like we're done. Meet me at the Tapsilog* place by the train tracks. (FN: fried rice with beef and fried egg) You know the place? At Isabel's? Yeah. Let's meet there at 10:00 PM. Aren't we going to... I thought you wanted to be with me outside? I already gave TJ my money... What do we do for cash? Where do you really want to spend time with me? Out there or in here? In 1986, Vivian Del Rosario opened an eatery in Quezon City. It was for people with a small budget like truck drivers, jeep drivers, and tricycle drivers. She would sell beef shank soup and tapsilog. Bam! It was a hit! Did you know she also coined the term 'Tapsilog'? Because back then they used to say it separately: tapa (cured, fried beef), sinangag (fried rice) and itlog (egg). Sir. Are you going to order anything? That's your fourth glass of water. Sorry, I'm still waiting for... Miss, two orders of Tapsilog and fresh coconut juice. Okay, ma'am. Sorry I'm a little late; I had to take a shower. You eat here often? Yeah, if I have extra cash. I like these kinds of food. What about you? What's your favorite? Sorry? My all-time favorite is Tapsilog. But I also really like Bangsilog (milkfish, fried rice, egg) and Sisigsilog! What's yours? Me? My favorite is Cornsilog (corned beef, fried rice, egg) and Hotsilog (hotdog, fried rice, egg). What about Pepsilog? You don't like that? What's that? Pepe (Vagina), Sinangag (fried rice), Itlog (egg)! What's your story? Where are you from? The Area. No, before that. Ah, here and there. Near the farms. Where are your parents now? What is this, a job interview? This is just who I am: alone in life, getting by... I don't need to cling on to anyone for help. Not even my parents. Why did you ask me out here if you could just go alone? I didn't ask you out here for company. I asked you out here because I'm bored. So I'm just a way to kill time. Like you don't just use me to get off? But I'm paying, you're not. This is my treat! I'm worth more than what you ordered! And I'm worth more than your 500 pesos! Don't worry. When I get back to the Area I'm bringing 1000 pesos. Whatever, finish your food. We're going somewhere. Hurry up. Fun, huh? Everything's bright and loud! I wish the whole world was like this! I don't know about that. Follow me. Come on, come on! Watch your step! Look at this! Look at them! Woohoo! Yes! This is so wrong, Candy! What? Look how much fun they're having! Go, number one! Yes, Six! Go! Oh my gosh, look at these dollar bills! Hurry! All this just for a dollar! How much is a dollar in peso? About 48 to 50 pesos. Imagine if those were thousand-peso bills! There'd be a riot. I'm sure none of them want to cause trouble. They're fine with chump change, it's better than nothing. That's not how the world works, Toto. The more expensive something is, the more people go after it. You guys got a table? No, we were just leaving. Tell Boss Darwin I said hi! Tell him Candy dropped by! Thank you! I met Boss Darwin last month. He bumped into me at the supermarket. I was drinking milk tea at the time, and it spilled on me. He kept saying sorry. He invited me to his bar and said if I ever decided to hang out, three buckets of beer's on him. Did you go? Nope. I'm shooting for a different favor. Hey, aren't you a teacher? - History? - Mhm. Why History? Don't your students get bored with you? It's important to know your past and where you came from. Isn't the present more important? I thought the same thing too, at first, when my parents were still together. Which one do you think I'd choose? The past, when my family was intact or now that we're not? You look fine to me. Even if I don't know about your past, and you think it's better than how things are going, you're okay in my book. Really? Mm-hm. Unless you used to be a billionaire. Well, then, thanks for your time! Hey, can I see with you again? You know where to find me! And my rate! What are you looking for? Side hustle? A person can't live off one source of income. Toto, maybe you want to try multi-level marketing! Money rolls in quickly if you're hardworking. You just need 7,000 pesos to start. I don't have 7,000. Can't you borrow from anyone? You gotta make some sacrifices at the start! You need to swallow your pride! Eventually, you'll have got it made! Have you guys got it made? Not yet! But soon, that's for sure! Yeah, one day you'll be surprised, we'll roll up to school in an SUV! If I get rich, I wouldn't be teaching anymore. Come on! Come on! It's just 7,000 pesos! Then we'll recruit students! Come on, Toto, it's just 7,000 pesos! Hurry up! I've got an idea. Ice candy! Ice candy! Sir! Ice candy, ice candy! Sir! Give us three. Five pesos each. Come and get 'em. Okay, sir. Sir! We saw you last night. Obviously. We bumped into each other, remember? You were with that pretty girl who works at the Area. We'll rat you out to the principal. Fine, fine... what do you want? Okay, you can have those for free... and get more. Two for each. Thanks, sir. So we're good, yes? Scram. Sir! Ice candy isn't enough. We want something else. What do you want? We want you to shut up about us going to Area. Deal! Is that all? Easy peasy. That was easy! We'll go back to the Area tonight, Sir- -to finish the 'initiation'! With that girl you were with last night. The mestiza! I knew you liked fair girls! You know what I like. You know it! You know what, there are other girls you can get for cheap. You should go for them. No way, sir. I've got my eye on that chick. She's making my mouth water! She's my pick, too! I can't keep my eyes off of her. Right?! Hey! Hey! That girl's is my cousin! If I hear about you going back to the Area, you're dead! Shit, they're cousins. You thought you could blackmail me? Buy all of this. Son, you won't get rich from selling ice candy. Mother, I don't need to get rich. I just need to earn some extra cash to buy some stuff. Like? Candy. Candy? Here, caramels! Are you saving money for Stephanie? Secret! But seriously, son. Ice candy won't be enough. You're smart. Think of something! Hey! Watch it! What are you doing? Get it right! Sir. Sir. Teacher Nagit. Maybe you could require your students to buy my ice candy. Sounds like a headache, sir Camaya. They might think we're trying to shake them down. Right... How about this, sir. Just tire them out so they'll be more keen to buy my ice candy. Then I should probably get a cut. How much is one? Five pesos. Alright, I get one peso from each piece you sell. What? I'm just kidding! How about this... I'll let them know that you're selling ice candy, but it's their choice if they wanna buy. Ice that alright? Do you get it? I said ice, because... ice candy... Okay, sir, thanks. Gimme one, alright? What? Gimme one! Bro! I haven't seen you around lately. Yeah, two weeks. I was saving up for Candy. Bro TJ! I'll take Candy. Oh, man, Candy's gone. What do you mean she's gone? She doesn't work here anymore. She moved to a bar in Fields. She said she deserves better than this shithole. Her beauty's not for cheap scrubs. Candy? Hey! Candy! Hey, she's not there! Hey! Hey! Bro! Candy! She's not here! - That's not her! - Candy! Hey, what the fuck are you doing? I said she's not here! Stop bothering us! Boss, sorry about that! Maybe you haven't been paying her right! Her patrons couldn't afford her! You couldn't even pay her regular rate! I can pay now! You should have been coming here every night so she wouldn't get bored! Then she wouldn't have left! Candy! I want Number 5! You want Number 5? Yes! Don't worry, sir! In a few minutes, I will bring her here! Ma'am! Can I get Number 9? Do you have a table? Here she is! Hi! How are you? How did you find me? Just a hunch. Is the work you're doing here the favor you wanted from Boss Darwin instead of the free beer? You've got a sharp memory. Place an order for us. What do you want? Margarita. Fuck. Why? It's nothing. Sure, let's order! One margarita. What do you mean one? We're both having drinks! MJ! Two margaritas! Two! What are you doing? My job. You're a customer. I'm at your table. This is what you get. Why is your heartbeat so fast? What are you so nervous about? Drink. To calm you down. Are you in a hurry? You said I should drink! Order another one! Do you want some food? Try their steak. [clears throat] Well? The money I brought was just enough for the two margaritas. Next time, bring more money so we can talk longer. Wait, wait! Can I see you after your shift? What for? I don't know... Eat at Isabel's? I thought you said you're out of cash. Oh, right... Just walk around? Tell stories? I get off at 3 a.m. I understand how this world works. - The one with the money gets the prize. - Hi! So this is your request! If both parties can afford it, the one with the higher bid wins. In that case, what on earth am I doing here? Why do I keep playing when the odds are against me? Handsome! Want some nuts? There's lots of garlic! You sell candy? No, sorry. What time is it? 11:00 p.m., ma'am. It's still early. I'll get back to work. Nuts! Sir, you want some nuts? Handsome! It's almost midnight! I'm going home! Watch yourself, yeah? There are pickpockets here! Thank you, ma'am. How much for a pack? Ten pesos. Auntie! Can customers take the girls home? Of course! I know there's a price for that! I love this hotel. We're going to have such a good time. Candy! Are we still down for later? Not any more, Toto. Someone's taking me home. Maybe next time. Is this guy bothering you? No! No! He's my cousin! Jojo. Oh, man, I'm sorry! Nice to meet you, Jojo! Listen, Jojo. Your cousin's hot as fuck! Please take care of my cousin. I don't want anything bad happening to her. I've loved her since the day we met. Don't worry, I'll take good care of her! Come on, baby! Well, here we are! Wow! This place is so whimsical! "Whimsical?" Where'd you learn that word? From my customer. He's a writer in Germany. In all my years going to Fields, I've never met a girl like you before. I can tell you're smarter than the rest of them. Cause I am! It's actually a turn-off for most guys. They just want their ladies fun and submissive. You do know what "submissive" means, right? So, why did you take me out? I like the challenge of taming a headstrong woman. Go for it. You can leave if you want. Can I shower first? Has Father come home? [Rej] No. I think he lives at the pastor's compound now along with the other members of their group. Rumors say they're a cult. Hang on, if he goes home, will you come home, too? I don't know. You always said you'd never forgive him, why do you keep checking up on him? Just curious. What's happening? Why are you burning your dolls? Will I get rich from making those? Sir, can I buy some? Me, too! Me, too, sir! It's ten pesos each! Sir, weren't you selling these for five pesos? I put different ingredients this time. Imported! - It's too much. - Okay... Tomorrow, I'm telling the principal you were at the Area. Along with all your other violations! Like what, sir? This one plagiarized his essay! You brought playing cards! And you used a cheat sheet the other day! Sorry, sir. But I can cut you a deal. Give me 2,000 pesos each before the weekend and I'll keep my mouth shut. Sir, that's extortion! That's right! You know what, sir? What if we tell on you instead? We're calling our parents! You're about to take money from us! Go on, call him! Wait, who are you going to call? My dad, sir! - Go on, bring out your phones! - Just wait! I'm sorry, ok? The truth is... the girl you saw with me the other night isn't really my cousin. I knew it! You bang whores. Hey, you better watch your mouth. I love her. Sir. Can I ask you something? Why'd you try to extort us? It's payment for the bar fine so I can take her out. She's working at a bar now. Level up! Sir, one more thing. Isn't your pay enough as a teacher? I give most of it to my mother. Okay sir, here's what we'll do. We'll help you. Of course we'll help you. We'll give you 5,000 pesos. But we want a passing grade in return. Everything, including exams and quizzes, and no recitations. Right! We don't need high grades. We just need to pass. We'll keep it discreet. 12,000 pesos. 8,000 pesos. 10,000 pesos. Are you good with 10,000 pesos? You good? Hey, Let! Maybe you and your classmates want me to do your homework? For free? Of course not! It depends on the difficulty. Should be between 300 to 500 pesos. They can't afford your prices. What about the guy courting you? Isn't he in college? Maybe you could convince him to avail of my services. Wiggie doesn't need that. He's smart and responsible. But I'm sure he wants to impress you. He would want to be close to your one and only brother! And me? What am I getting out of this? I'll cook up an alibi to cover for you so you can go out and spend time with Wiggie. Deal! I'll call him. You're back. I missed you. Order something. I only have enough for a beer. That's not going to fly in here. I know, I just need to tell you something, Three minutes max then I'll leave. Sorry, I don't know when I'll be available. Nevermind that. At the end of the month, I'll be back here and take you out. I'll pay for the bar fine, and we'll enjoy ourselves from night until morning! The bar fine's expensive. I know. Leave it to me. Which hotel are you bringing me to? Hotel? Yeah, you said 'till morning.' Where are we going to spend the night? Shit. Don't worry, I'll plan for it. Promise. At the end of the month. Three flavors, five pesos each. We have three flavors. Alright, thanks very much! See you guys again later, ok? That includes the ones for Wiggie's frat brothers. Hello, Pa? Son! Why are you calling? Does your mother know? No, can we keep it a secret? Why, something wrong? You know how mother is. She's a little shy and prideful, but we're struggling a bit with expenses here. You think you can send some money, How much do you need? 10,000 pesos? Here's your money, baby! One, two, seven, out. Hey, Candy! Come here. Who's it from? From Justinian? No. Take it. I couldn't wait for the end of the month. Toto? Good evening. What do you want to drink? Margarita? Sure. Two margaritas. Okay, sir. Got your paycheck? Who do I need to talk to so I can take you out? Where are we going? We'll eat, go bar hopping, and then the hotel. Someone's all loaded up. Are you sure you're spending it wisely? Very wisely. Auntie Ritz. What? Sir wants to take me out. 5,000 pesos until 4:00 a.m. And until 8:00 a.m? You're so handsome. Why? Because I can afford you now? Dummy. You look good in those clothes. It suits you. Thank you. I'm starving! Let's eat. What's your budget for dinner? It's alright. Order whatever you want. No, really? Don't think about it. Get what you like. Yes, ma'am? Angus tenderloin steak, clubhouse sandwich, Panizza Royale. Chicken ceasar salad, pasta bolognese, and one sparkling water. What's your order? Actually, I'm still full. I'd like an extra rice, I'll just get from what she ordered. Drinks, sir? Sparkling water for him, too. Right? Yeah, I love sparkling water. - Go ahead. - Okay, sir. So, if you didn't become a teacher, what would you job be right now? Maybe... I'd be just like my dad: a fortune teller. For real? Yeah! People would go to him to have their future told. Sometimes he would use cards... sometimes he would read their palm. Like an actual psychic or is he a fraud? Who knows! But there was this woman, and he told her she would get pregnant. Eventually she did get pregnant... ...thanks to him. He's an asshole, my father. What about you? If you didn't end up... like that, what would you have been? I dunno, dead? What? This is the only thing I want to do in life. Everything I want, I can get from this job. More importantly, this is what I'm good at. Don't you agree? Unless somebody comes and takes me away from this life. I got us this room. Let's have another drink? Is there a problem? No! There's no problem! Let's go for a dip. You're so beautiful. I know. Where am I prettier? At the Area, or here? You could be sprawled out on a haystack and you'd still be lovely. Join me. I don't have clothes for that. You don't need to wear anything. I've seen everything. - Is this mine? - Mm-hm. What a dream, huh? We still have a lot of time. I'm counting the hours I have left with you so I can manage my time better. You can do whatever you want with me now, so make the most of it. I would only want it if you want it, too. I do want it. Even without money involved? Hey... what's wrong? Don't you want this? I do. I want this so much. I'm just sad because I know I'll never get to have this again. I've used up all my savings for this night. Why the hell wasn't I born rich? Hey! You can leave even if it's not yet 8 a.m. I'll just go to sleep. You're still here? I took another client. Someone booked me after I left you. He's staying in the same hotel. Really? You're so hardworking. Have you had any sleep? Where's your customer? You might get sick or something. You didn't sleep... have you eaten? I was just kidding! Why would I leave when I still have an hour with you? Come on, let's swim! Is there an extra charge for that? This is your first time at a hotel, huh? If you're a guest here, you can use the pool for free. Get in! I don't want to. It's too cold! You're so lame. Look at what I'm wearing! Those are your regular clothes! Suit yourself. If you woke up and I was actually gone, what would you be doing in the hotel? I'd check out. What a waste of money. Check-out is at noon. I only booked a room for you. You can't enjoy a hotel room on your own? Is that it? It's better if you're with someone. You could savor the queen-sized bed or the fast speed WiFi. I got you breakfast for your room. That's 800 pesos? What about that? How much for that one? 275 pesos. These prices are unbelievable. Well, go ahead and eat. I'm still good. Let me have a sip first. Want me to stay with you until check out? I can extend for a few more hours. I can't pay you anymore. I wasn't gonna charge you for the extra. Won't Auntie Ritz get mad? Why? She doesn't need to know. Besides, it's my personal choice. So it's none of her business. I wanted to get a massage with you but I'm dead broke. Why don't you just come with me outside? We won't need to spend any more. Aside from the jeepney and tricycle fare. So refreshing... It's been a while since my feet actually touched the ground. What about you? Ah, but you're a city boy! Never been to places like this, have you? Aren't there snakes in there? You're so fussy. You're good at History, right? Do you know the history of this place? What town is this? No, I meant this exact place where we are. Sorry, I don't know anything about it. I do. When I was younger, my parents would always bring me here. Instead of having lunch at home, this is where we would go to eat and spend time together. We didn't have much back then. We couldn't afford to eat at the mall or at a restaurant. We didn't even own a television. But that's okay. We had fun. Father had a favorite passage from the Bible. "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." He said we should be content with a simple life because the Lord would reward the poor in the end. I really held on to that when I was younger. What about you? Do you believe in that? But when mother fell ill, that's when my views changed. I witnessed how hard it was to be poor in this world. When you don't have enough to buy medicine, for the hospital bills, or the doctor's fees. Did your father change his views? No. He kept praying. He said to offer everything up to the Lord. But the truth is, he just didn't want to find a way. He's lazy. He was just using the Bible so he doesn't have to face his reality. If you don't have money, you have no value. When mother died, I left home immediately. I told myself, I would never end up like my parents. I'm not going to settle for scraps. I will do anything, use everything... even my own body to not have to live like we used to. That is my history, Toto. Would you blame me if I didn't want to remember the past? So why did we come here? If it just reminds you of the bad memories? I just wanted you to know my history. I know you've been wondering why I ended up like this. You know, not once... not even in passing, even if I don't really understand your line of work, I never once judged you. Thank you. That's why you should do your best, Toto. Become as wealthy as you can until you can buy everything you want. What if this is all I'll ever be? What if I'm fated to be ordinary? What if you're wrong? What time is it... It's 12:00 PM! I need to check out! Let's go! Sir? Where can I get a good massage? It's real boring here. There's a good place beside here... - Not just massage... - Candy, Candy... Hi guys! Excuse me. Can I borrow Candy for a while? Just for a while. Just for a few minutes. - Okay. - Okay, no problem! Thank you! What is it? You have a gig! This is big money. Justinian wants to take you out! What about my customers tonight? It's not tonight, it's for next week! Wow, he reserved early. For how many hours? One week. Out of the country! How much did you charge him? 25,000 pesos! That seems a little low. At least you get a free vacation! Free fare, free food, what more could you ask for? You better take it! So where are you planning to take me? Away from here. What's the purpose of your trip? Business. But aside from that, I also think I'm in love with you. And I want to spend time with you there... away from this environment. Like a... A girlfriend? Like a wife. If we get along, I'm going to take you away from this life... I promise. And I'm going to give you the life of a princess. I don't care if I have to pay Ritz everything I own. I will. But why me? I told you before. You're not like the rest. You're special. Sir! Take care! Sir! You guys take care! Sir! Sir! Good afternoon. Do I know you? Can I treat you to dinner? Is this about Letlet? No, sir. Some of my brothers are starting their theses this sem. But a few of them are busy with other things. Such as? Businesses... Vlogs? And their girlfriends. They're asking me to do it, but I can't focus on it because I'm busy with my own thesis, as well as my internship. Just cut to the chase. How much would it cost for you to do it? Are we aiming for 'Best Thesis' or just passable? Passable sounds fair. P25,000 each. P15,000. P22,000. P18,000. You know what, I take it back. I just want a clean way of making a living. We might get caught. Are you sure, sir? It would be a waste! Why? You want a cut, don't you? Yeah, hopefully. I just feel bad for Let-let. I can't afford to get her anything. Then find another side hustle. Don't settle for chasing cuts. That's lazy work. Don't you mean 'working smart'? Besides, my sister... She doesn't want fancy things. She's not going to dump you just coz you don't give her gifts. By the way, here's the payment for the reaction paper you wrote for me. This might be the last for now. Yes, that's the way. Let's keep things clean. This'll be my last job from you, too. Excuse me for a while. Aren't you Toto... - You're Toto, right? - Yes, ma'am. Auntie Ritz, where's Candy? Candy resigned... Right after she came back from abroad. The foreigner she escorted got her pregnant. We can't even get a hold of the guy. He just vanished when he found out Candy's pregnant. But she left a message. She told me to give you her address when I see you. I just don't understand why it took you three months to check up on her! As I understand it, you two were very close. Candy? I've tried everything to get the stain off, but it just won't budge. What do you think I should do? I don't know anything about that. And there's no internet here, too. Forget it. Where did the stain come from? I got a miscarriage. Are you alright? Aside from the fact that my saving's drying up and I'm out of a job? Yeah. Pack your things. You're coming with me. I told you to find a woman to be your girlfriend! Not to get some girl pregnant! What are you going to feed your child with Stephanie? Can you pay for the kid's education? And you, woman! Where are your parents? I'm an orphan. And I'm not Stephanie. My name is Candy. Why couldn't you be more careful? I had a miscarriage. You have nothing to worry about. Letlet, give me that. You son of a bitch. You knock someone up, she miscarries, and you don't even tell me! I didn't tell you because I knew you'd react this way! Calm down, Ma. Why did you bring her here, then? What's your plan? Candy will live here with us. You shouldn't have fought with your mother. If I was her, I wouldn't want my son to marry a whore, either. Why did you have to tell her that? It's better that she knows the truth, so we don't have to keep looking over our shoulder. That was your past, Candy. We should focus on who you are now! This is my choice. There's no turning back now. Where are we staying? See? Thank you. It's still adjusting that's why it's flickering. Looks like it. I'm never leaving your side. Me too. For richer or for poorer. Do you even know how to do that? I saw it on TV but it's the first time I'm trying it! Here, let me. See, there are some weevils left! What? Rice weevils. See? There's a lot! Go on, finish sweeping. I'll take care of this! I'll sweep. Want to take turns fanning? No, just to go sleep, love. I'll take care of us. I'll take care of you. They say you were accepting bribes in exchange for passing grades? Who told you this? They were the ones who offered it! And you took the bait! You are the teacher! You should have known better! Ma'am, Ma'am I'm sorry, ma'am! I was desperate at the time! I really needed the money then. Ma'am, please don't fire me. They told me they also saw you with a prostitute! They were there, too! I saw them at Area. In their uniforms! Ma'am, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! Why are you home early? Is it because of me? No. They found out I was taking money from students in exchange for a passing grade. That was a long time ago. You were extorting money? For what? So I could be with you. Take you out of the bar, pay for the hotel... So it is because of me! No! What's your plan, then? I'll think of something. I'll find another job. How's your job application at the Tourism office? It's been three weeks. They haven't gotten back to you? They said there's no vacancy. I said they could take me on as a tour guide, or if they have seminars on history... Give me that. Yes, what is it? I'd like two hotdogs. And six chicken feet. Okay, miss. Your lipstick looks good, miss. Here. Love, please find some change. Let's eat! Where'd this come from? I used the money we earned yesterday. My love, I was thinking of trying out as a rider. Those guys that deliver food? I'll just borrow my friend's bicycle. You think that's a good plan? Yeah! It's up to you, if that's what you want. Can you manage the grill stand by yourself? Of course. Dig in. What time are you coming home? Around 11:00 p.m. or by midnight. Okay, love. Take care, alright? Love you. I promise, love, I'll be successful soon. Bye! Bye! Take care! Love? I'm home. Love? Are you going to take a bath first, or are we going to eat? Love, what's with all this new stuff? Aren't we supposed to be saving? We might not have enough to pay for electricity and water. I've already set aside money for that. What do you want to eat? I'll just have spicy sardines. Pick one. Where did this come from? I bought it earlier. Which one do you want? I'll just have the wings. Let me just heat it up, okay? I'll be right back. Even when I was younger, I wasn't the type to question why we didn't have much Or why we didn't have this or that... I just accepted that we need to work hard to improve our lot in life. That's great, bro. You're the man. Things will get better for all of us. We just gotta have faith. Isn't that right, man? Dude, my cousin is a prostitute. How can I make her stop working? Eat up, love. Do you have a job interview lined up? Love? Goddamnit Candy, what is this? Where did those come from? What's your problem? I brought those from my old rental. Am I supposed to just throw them away? Liar! What, you think I don't know? Is this what I think it is? So what if it is? You said... For richer or for poorer. I was like this when you met me. You loved me in spite of that. Why do you seem so disgusted now? Because I thought you changed. Look at these stuff I bought. All for you. Use it for your job interview! Or to those side hustles from those stupid seminars you kept going on about that till now are nothing but talk! You're proud of these? These things? I don't want any of these shit if the cost is you whoring out your body! I don't want any of it! What else do I have to do to keep you to myself? Nothing! Nothing, because I'm already yours, Toto. It's you I come home to. Fuck, you're the only man who gets to lay with me for free. You are special. Well, fuck me sideways. I never really stood a chance, did I? I had the nerve to walk out of our house, and drag you with me, but it's all too much for me anyway. Is that the reason for all this? You wanted to prove something? Love... Love... Please give me some time. I can provide for us. I can, too. Let me do what I do best. Can't you try something else? Something that won't hurt me? This is what I'm good at, Toto. This is the only thing I'm good at. Don't deny me the chance to benefit from it. If I did the same thing, how would you feel? Would you like to try? I know some people. Let's work together for our future. Keeping you with me is costing me so much. I can't afford to love you. Don't love me if that's the case, Toto. Quit hoping you'll ever own me. You're not the one who can save me from this. I was fated to be like this. What if you're wrong? Toto. Candy and I broke up, mother. That's good. Mother, forgive me. Damn it, I've lived this long and I still don't have anything to show for it. It's starting to feel like our dreams are never going to happen. A large house... with a swimming pool and a wide garden... Son, those are just wishes. All wishes are likely to not be granted. Besides, I never wanted those things for myself but for you and Letlet... and your future children. But if you can't grant that, that doesn't mean I'll think less of you. Sometimes luck has a lot to do with it. If we get lucky, then, praise the Lord! But if not, then that's that. I will provide for you until my dying breath. But... Son, it's not too late! You're still young! We all have our time. Alright, you don't need to hand over your wages anymore. You'll just have to pay the... water, electricity, and internet, okay? Then everything else is all yours, son. Save as much as you can, until you can stand on your own. Okay? Thanks, mother. But I got fired from teaching. It's a long story. Well, forget about that, son. You'll find another job, okay? All right, enough moping around. Help me mix this. Hi. How's it going? Good. I'm Candy. You want to hang out with me? Sure. The more expensive something is, the more that people scramble for it. But I'm tired of bidding and playing "pick me." We have to accept that there are things beyond our budget. We need to rid ourselves of that temptation. Yes, we need to erase them from our minds. No matter the cost. No matter how much you love them. But I'm grateful to have met you, and for the experience of you. I will keep improving myself not so that I could make you mine, but to add value to myself. It's not your role to save me from this. This is my fate. What if you're wrong? What's wrong? Are you okay? Nothing, maybe... Maybe it's just the alcohol. Let's go take a shower together. You've got to pay me more if you want more. Oh yeah? Why? Cause I'm special.
