Okay? Why do not you let me back into the house so I do not have to deal with these kinds of issues ever again? You have only been out of the house a month and you are whining like it has been an eternity It is an eternity It feels like that But you know what? She is my daughter, too. Right? If you want me to consider that you have to put a little bit of more effort to prove to me that you are ready for that A little effort? I'm here, I'm trying Honey, that was never the issue I got to go Wait a second, why are you getting your way all the time? Why? It's not my way, Eddie Sometimes things come up and you have to be a little bit more understanding I mean you forced me for years to be understanding - so I guess now it is your turn! - Understanding? I'm understanding that my daughter would rather spend time with her father That I understand You know what? If I'm not going to get her today because obviously I'm not then I'll pick her up on Monday after school I'll get her on Monday afternoon okay? - Yes, sure, fine - What? Fine! This will be great - Hi, Eddie - Hey! What do you want? Stay back Stay back What do you want? What do you want? Hi, Eddie Look, take whatever you want Just do not hurt me, okay? What could we possibly want in here? And besides, if we took anything we would be put on the naughty list for sure - Naughty list? - Yes Well, we do not want to get on Santa's bad side Mario This is Mario's idea Hey! Mario, where are you? You had something to do with this Eddie, this isn't a prank We're actually two of Santa's elves - I'm Slippy - And I'm Dippy Yes, Slip and Dippy my butt Hey! Mario, where are you? - Should we show him? - I think we're going to have to Listen I'm going to find out it's you You're done with me you get it? Where you at? I know this is a prank What? And now for our final trick... Is something supposed to happen? Yes, the polar bear might have been too much ''But I didn't ask for anything else'' I know, come, let us try to sleep a little, okay? - Hi, Eddie! - Hey, Eddie Spaghetti! Have you been a naughty boy this year? He's been naughty You're a naughty little boy Eddie, I love your Christmas pajamas! Eddie! I thought it was a dream What the hell is going on? - We are elves, Eddie - And we are here to tell you that... You're going to be the next Santa Claus! - Being Santa is a dream - I wish I was Santa Look, Eddie, we understand that this is a lot to process - Just hear us out - And if I do that, you'll go away? Probably not So there is a little-known secret that every 30 years or so a new Santa Claus is chosen And this year, that is you Elves, okay So let us say I wanted to be Santa Claus, which I don't because I don't believe in Santa Claus and I couldn't do it anyway - Why not? - Because... I am Latino, and Santa is white Silly. Santa has no race color or gender Throughout history there have been Santas from all over the world Yes, we have had Jamaican Santas ''Chinese Santas Indian Santas'' ''Scottish Santa'' Heck! We even had a Jewish Santa You name it and we have had one - Mind-blowing - Remember the alien Santa? That was my favorite! Really, I mean, why me? I don't even like Christmas Blasphemy! Don't you ever say you don't like Christmas - Fine, But why me? - We are elves, Eddie It's a little bit above our pay grade to be questioning those decisions - You were chosen, so you're it - We got to get started soon because we have a lot to do and not much time to do it in order to get you ready for Christmas Eve! Yes. So we're going to need you to sign all these papers and... Look... I can't do this. I have a job A family. You understand?

That is not going to look good on the old resume See you here tomorrow! That is funny, Eddie You want to know why? Because when I had to leave work early to pick up Gabby after you said you would I wasn't stuck in traffic because there wasn't any! Yes, you should be! That is obvious! You know, it's one thing to always keep me waiting, but now Gabby? Eddie, I had to leave work early which means I didn't get to do it so now I have to finish it at home No, do not come here Absolutely not And then I have to wonder when you're going to bring her home I don't think so. I've been just as understanding as you have been - Mom, please - No! My God! "If you're going to be Santa Claus you need to live like Santa Claus" "Love, Slippy and Dippy" - Eddie! - Hello - Eddie! Put it there bro! - Let us do it! - My man Eddie G - Hey You guys notice anything different about Eddie lately? Only that he's super awesome now He used to be all broody and cranky Now he's super fun - And he smells delicious - Delicious? Like fresh-baked cakes and cookies Jenny in Accounting said she gave him a kiss on the cheek the other day because he helped her out with something and not only did he smell like cookies, he tasted like them too What are you guys talking about? Jeez! I just want to go over there and lick his face Am I the only one that notices his skin looks like a lizard? Don't be such a hater. It's the new skin care products he's using You should be ashamed for yourself for judging what's on the outside instead of what's on the inside Let's go Rude - Hi, Eddie - Hello there - ''So good to see you'' - ''Yes, of course'' ''It's Christmas time'' - Hi, Eddie - What is wrong with you two? Nothing that I can see. Everything seems to be in order Why? Do you see something wrong? Have you ever heard of knocking? Why, yes, of course Knocking Maybe you should try it out sometime before popping up while I'm taking my bath But if we knocked then you wouldn't be surprised Exactly What do you want? - It's time for your training - Now? - What other time is there? - I am taking my bath He's taking a bath No, no! Don't do it Fine, fine, I'll do it. I'll do it Okay, so let's go! Go, go, go! Come on! He's not moving Why isn't he moving? Could I have some privacy, please? - Why? - Because I am naked Fine We're going to make a note of this on your report "Late because naked" Good There you are. Take a seat - During your first week of training - Which you were pathetic at - Thanks - You're welcome During your first week of training You dealt with some of the physical challenges Santa has to face Now that we're in our second week... We're going to have to step it up because there's only ten days left till Christmas I'm sorry I'm not sorry Now that we're in our second week you will not only have to handle more physical challenges but mental challenges as well "What is the circumference of the earth?" "How many square feet is the continent of Africa?" That is easy "Where would you find the most remote islands on earth?" How would I know any of this? You should know because Santa needs to know - Yes - Why would I have to know the square footage of the continent of Africa? Because you do Now, you have one hour to complete this examination - Pencils ready - I don't have a pencil Begin Pencils down - No, no, it is all right - What? It is wrong P-minus? That is not even a real grade No, Eddie Yes, yes, it is. P, for "Pathetic" Eddie! What? Make sure you memorize all that for next time Wednesday, warehouse 3:00 p.m. sharp Wednesday? Hey boss. Got those naughty list papers for you to sign Just... Just leave them there Hey, shouldn't you be on Santa training detail? We're sorry you got passed over for a promotion, by the way I think you would have made a great Santa Yes, so do I. I would take this organization to where it should be No more free rides for kids So, okay, so you've been a spoiled brat this whole year You take out the garbage once... Once and you're on the nice list? - Not on my watch - I hear you, boss These Santas have ruined Christmas If I was the boss, I would stick coal in every kid's stockings It's going to happen Soon enough In another 30 years, maybe? - Maybe not - That's it? You're just going to leave me hanging like that? Well, Matilda, I can't reveal all my secrets Everything will be told in due time - Hey, honey - Daddy! How are you baby? - No traffic today? - So good to see you No Thanks for doing this, okay? She wouldn't stop pestering me, so... Here we go I am going to talk to your mom, okay? Where do they get all the energy from? What? No, she just loves being with you And you're so good with her You know why? Because we're the same age up here Finally, something we both can agree on - You think you're attractive? - I guess Two things we agree on See? Look, I just wanted to talk to you about something and now it might not be the right time, but... Look I know this is not the life you planned - Eddie - No, I... I think we should work it out. We should do it for Gabby, you know? I do hate seeing her upset all the time Her not really understanding why you're not living with us anymore I don't understand why I'm not living there anymore - Eddie - I'm just kidding I know Believe me, I know You know, you got a big heart and you're funny And you can be anything that you want to be, but... - But what? - No buts I just don't want Gabby to grow up without a father, like I did I don't want her to do that - How about we have dinner? - Really? Yes. Yes. We'll sit and we'll talk and we'll hash everything out No judgments, no getting angry at each other. Just talking All right, but I think we're going to have to call your mom to referee No, just you and I - How about we go to Claro's? - Our Claro's? - The one and only - Okay. I could swing that So are you going... Are you going to let me know when? - Okay - When?

Head, please - Surprise! - Listen, I was training to be Santa I'm not supposed to be here So I need to get out as soon as possible Nobody's supposed to be here You'll have fun. It's good training This is fun! Look, I'm a felon because of you two - Thank you - You're welcome Guess you're still working on that sarcasm thing? Well, it's always polite to respond with "you are welcome" When someone says "thanks" All right, can we get out of here, please? Can you do any of those elf things and just poof us out of here? Given the circumstances I'm going to forget that you just asked about poofing again Besides they took our candy canes Do you think they'll give them back? The bigger question here is how did Silent Simon get out? Yes Who let him out of the Cage? - The Cage? - Given that you're going to be the next Santa you should probably know Know what? Long ago... Long ago, during the reign of the first Santa... ''He had the idea to create the perfect elf' ''He wanted one that would never tire of making toys'' ''Wouldn't ever lose the Christmas spirit'' ''And most importantly, they could do double the work'' ''in half the time'' ''But somewhere along the way... things went terribly wrong'' ''And Silent Simon was born'' ''It was like everything Santa wanted the elf to be...'' ''Except the opposite'' ''He was better, stronger and faster than the other elves'' ''But he lacked all Christmas spirit, joy and fun'' - Like a bizarro elf? - Yes. Yes, Eddie You could say that Anyway... Santa tried working with him to put him on the right path But things just continued to get worse ''Something had to be done'' ''It took Santa and 12 other elves to take him down'' ''They put him in an inescapable prison under the ice'' ''We call it the Cage'' ''And that's where Silent Simon has been'' ''Locked away, where he can't hurt anyone'' But as far as I know only Santa has access to the Cage Santa would never let Silent Simon out. Something smells fishy You think something's going down in the North Pole? No, no, no, something actually smells fishy I think it's him It's him How is it possible that the worst elf ever created got his butt kicked by two moron elves and one slacker janitor? Well, he didn't get his butt kicked In fact, he was about to finish the job when the cops showed up Silent Simon had to get out of there Like that makes it any better Where is he now? Off the grid One thing I have learned, if you want things done right You got to do it yourself, You know what? Pack your bags, Matilda - Where are we going? - Miami Hey, Garcia Come on, man. You're up Honey, thank you for coming I'm sorry I had to call you I don't want more explanations! This was that something big you were working on? - Becoming a thief? - No this is a mistake. It's their fault I had nothing to do with it What's this? Yes, the divorce papers? You want to do this now? And I'm going to file for full custody Please Clara! Not her, not now! Hold on, hold on, you got to get processed out first Come on, you can't break the rules once in a while? - No, no, I can't - Not even once? Get your property Done? We are good? We are done, we are good Hi, Eddie! Didn't jump. Well done You ready to get to work? We've got a great session for you today I'm done. Forget it What? You can't be done You didn't even start Listen, I'm done with you guys I am done with the Santa thing I am done This about last night? You know We're sorry about that You're sorry? That's all you're going to say, is that you're sorry? We are really sorry? This is not worth it Wait, Eddie, no You can't just quit Eddie, tonight's the big night You must be Gabby, no? ''Gabby! I told you not to open the door for anybody!'' How do you know? Can I help you? Yes, you may I thought I made myself clear We know We just wanted to deliver your Christmas gift before we left You know what I want for Christmas? My life back Must have been a good one Yes, it was! Now, get out! Okay. I'm just going to leave these out here Take care, Eddie Yes. See you, Eddie Merry Christmas ''Something is happening, guys'' - What's going on? - ''Give me that'' - ''Listen up, Sleepy and Dopey'' - It's Dippy ''Shut up. If Eddie ever wants to see his family again...'' ''He would better not even think about flying that sleigh tonight'' - Eddie! Open up, Eddie! - Eddie! Eddie! - ''Eddie!'' - ''Eddie, open up!'' ''Eddie!'' Stand back Are you guys nuts? - Eddie - ''Well, hello, Eddie'' - ''Daddy!'' - Gabby? ''And we're back at Watsco Center at the University of Miami'' ''for a special Christmas exhibition basketball game'' Hello, U Nation. Welcome back and this goes out to all of you who were unable to make it home this Christmas Sorry Between the three of us we'll find them Are you sure about that? Santa! They love me Look at this Hey, I hope those two elves are nicer than the last ones Wait, what did you say? The two elves, they're definitely on the naughty list man They do a good dance - Where did you see me? - What? - Where did you see me? - What? - Where did you see me? - In the laundry room Come on, guys Hey, Eddie, I am onto you, man! Those girls are nuts! It's the same old Eddie Hey, I need those elves Eddie? Eddie? - Well, hello, Eddie - Who is this guy? Is that my clone? Do I actually look like that? Eddie, I love your job Hey, you guys Shut up, clone Now you two listen up Drop the candy, or the lady gets it Come on, do it. Do what he says, please. Go, come on Now kick it over All right, listen Just let them go now, okay? No. They are going to stay here till midnight Till you forfeit your chance of being Santa What? You did not tell her? Mrs. Garcia your husband over here had a chance at being Santa Claus That's not going to happen because that's my job You will never be Santa No, Slippy? You know what happens if the chosen Santa - can not fulfill his duties? - Christmas is canceled? - No, dummy - It's Dippy What happens is that a temporary Santa is appointed And you know who that temporary Santa might be? Who? The Easter Bunny No Me. The head elf But that will never happen because the selected Santa is picked from the best of the best That's why you weren't chosen And you think he is? Santa didn't choose him I chose Eddie. He's not Santa material. He's lazy Unworthy, unmotivated Non-Christmas-spirit-having quitter! In his file, it says, "worst possible candidate in the world" In the whole world He is right. I am a quitter and I already quit. Ask them - It is true he quit this morning - Excellent So now let them go I can't do that Why? You got what you want Let them go No. If I let them go, you could just turn around an un-quit And I need my little insurance policy back there So we are all going to just sit here nice and cozy, until it is too late So we are just going to wait here until midnight? Yes It is going to get awfully boring - Shut up, Dopey - It's Dippy! But wait. If Eddie does not become Santa Claus we're not going to have Christmas, you guys What do you care? You're not even real But he smells really nice Just like the workshop Knock it off Let us go. Come on Come here. Watch her I will go get her Gabby! Gabby! Let's go. Let's go - Daddy! - Come on - No! Daddy! - Go in there. Go in there Daddy! Dad! ''Ladies and gentlemen'' ''Welcome to this special Christmas Eve exhibition game'' ''between the Miami Hurricanes and...'' ''And there is a man on the floor'' I'm so sorry I put you guys through this. Thank God you are okay It's not over yet Nothing has changed Tick-tock Tick-tock. Tick-tock I am sorry, I am going to have to go somewhere - Go? Where? - The North Pole - Really? - Yes, I can't let him be Santa So this was the big project you have been working on? Santa? I will tell you all about it I will wait up for you All right, hold on One, two... three! Can we go any faster? Can we just poof there? What is up with you and all this poofing? Yes, stop it with the poofing We don't just poof places Get the presents packed up Get the reindeer hooked up We got five minutes Get that sleigh ready. Come on I think we are going to make it! - Eddie? - Eddie? Wait, it is right here. We got to go. Where are you going? In order to fly Santa's sleigh you have to look the part. Go What? It is okay. Just remember your training... Santa Jeez Eddie! A little notice next time Hello, Eddie - Santa! - Santa! Dad? - Dad? - Dad? - All this time? - Well, at least for the past 30 years That is why I was not around Because you were Santa Why didn't you tell me? I thought you didn't want to be around me anymore No, No, No, my son! That was not the reason! Rules are rules I can not tell anyone I am sorry I was away all the time, Eddie Forgive me son! Wait. Dad, you are the one who recruited me Well, in a sense. I knew Bruno was up to something I knew he would not let the perfect candidate be trained for Santa So when he started looking for the worst of the worst I made sure your name would come up Thanks, Dad Here They grow up so fast I am proud of you, son Bruno tried to set you up but you came out on top He thought he was sending two incompetent elves to train you but he did not count on their Christmas spirit Thanks - Was that a compliment? - I am not sure Dad... I don't want to break up the moment, guys, but... Okay, we got two minutes to get you on that... the-the-the... Sir - Let us go - Right. Let us go I will help you. Come on Come on, out of the way Since Bruno's gone, I'm going to stick around for a couple of months to show you the ropes until you settle in Wait, Dad You are going to leave me again? I'll be back, I promise But after 30 years on the job Santa needs some time off - They are all yours - Tick-tock, Eddie Wait, does that mean that I'm not going to be spending any Christmas with Gabby just like you did with me? That is part of the job I can't let that happen I don't want her to grow up like that I understand why you did it and I forgive you for it, but I can't... If you don't leave in one minute Bruno will be the next Santa You have to think of all the children in the world - not just your own, Eddie - She will understand, Eddie Just like you're understanding now But I can't change that, or bring those memories back into my life or Gabby's life Santa cannot be in two places at the same time Yes, I know, I can't be in two places at the same time - Yes? - Thirty seconds Besides, those are the rules All right He's doing it! I hate rules, Dad How do you get this thing going anyway? On, Dasher! On, Dancer! On Prancer! Bye, Eddie! Remember your training I got to work on that - Daddy! - Hey, honey Quiet, honey What are you doing here? I came here because I have something to tell you Be quiet, because we don't want to wake up mommy, okay? - Okay - Listen, I... I want to tell you something that I am really sorry Really sorry that you are in the middle of the problem - between Mommy and I - It's okay No, no, just listen to me, please I want you to know that I am sorry for everything I am sorry that me and your mommy put you through all this That you've been like in the center of our problems, and I don't... - Dad, I know... - Listen to me I love you more than anything You know that, right? And... And... And I should have been there for you, and I wasn't And I want you to know that I will always be there for you no matter what You know, I'll never, ever miss a Christmas with you, I promise So you're not going to be Santa anymore? No. No, I am but... You see Santa Claus is nothing without his helpers And I'm here to ask you if you want to help me out and come on the sleigh tonight and, say for the next 30 years? - I love you! - I love you, baby Now, let's get you a coat, okay? It's going to be pretty cold - Okay - Okay, come on, honey Freeze! Don't move! What, this again? I'm Santa Claus, for crying out loud Yes, for sure, buddy Like we haven't heard that one before I think he bought it Slippy and Dippy - Yes and you are late! - What? You should have been in Africa... 15 minutes ago Yes! Well, you can't talk to me that way because I'm Santa Claus now Can't talk to me that... What? Sir, you can not talk to me that way because I am Santa Claus, sir - That is what I thought - He gets really into the role of drill sergeant - Now, let us move it, people! - So, how is it going, Santa? I'm sure he's doing fine. We got to go! Move it, move it, move it! Hey, let's sing a song ''Eddie the sucky Santa had a very sucky life'' ''Then he met Dippy and Slippy now he is doing all right''
