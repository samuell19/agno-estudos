By the way, return to the ship can be accomplished by pushing "8" on the telephonic device in the booth.

I'm head of the entertainment committee on the Heidi High Cotillion, like a dance thing, you know we have, and I was wondering if you guys could, you know 'cause you play, you're really good and if you could play at it tonight? - Will she be there? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, she'll be there. - Then absolutely. - Okay, okay, great, okay. At the gym, Heidi High at eight o'clock to play. Okay.

This could be a very lustful, degenerative, dirty mission, and quite dangerous. Allow me to volunteer. - As Commander, I have a certain flexibility in the choice of experiments. I suggest that we now separate and perform our assigned tasks. - Sir, I think you're being hasty with the sexual response stimulator. It's never been used in this galaxy before. It may be too powerful for the female inhabitants of this planet. What if it works? Then what? - Don't worry, I have everything under control. - Hey, you cute little grease monkey. How would you like to tickle my carburetor? - Sorry, exhaust breath, I don't work on compacts. - Compacts. Hey, honey, whenever I see you I -- I -- I think I'm in love. - This is a mistake. Your feelings of attraction are caused by an electronic device. - I didn't know you were that way. - I don't understand. I never felt that way about a guy before, but it was kind of interesting. - Are you all right? I'm president of the First Aid Committee, although most of my time is taken up with administrative duties. Gee, even your medallion got broken. - Yes, it was quite fortunate. - Well, can I get you a doctor, or a vanilla shake or something? Here, let me get you a booth first.

Just calm down here for two seconds and I'll show ya how to fix it. Come on, come on, come on, help me out. - What a great night. We could go for a swim if the acid rains hadn't ruined the lake. - There are undesired chemicals in this lake. - I'll say, they used to bottle it as paint remover, back before economy got bad and everybody stopped working. - Have they tried to reintroduce natural fauna? - Yeah, they tried to stock it last summer, but all they got for all their trouble was a couple pounds of fried fish. - So use of this lake was stopped through the addition of these chemicals through rain fall. - Well, no, they stopped it before that when they opened a branch of plutonium nuclear freeze dried foods on the other side of the lake. - Were there any efforts to obtain compensation through your legal systems? - Yeah, but there was a law passed limiting all nuclear contamination claims to $17.50. But then all compensations were waived and they came and put an MX missile silo at the bottom of the lake. But the acid rains ruined the missile, which turned out not to work anyway, but the Defense Department still sued Speelburgh for the damages.

Now, boys and girls, may I have your -- may I have your attention, please. We have to cancel the rest of the Cotillion. There have been a number of murders. Yes, I said murders. Boys and girls, there's nothing to worry about. The situation is under control. ♪ I miss so much ♪ ♪ My world is empty without you, babe ♪ - There's something I wanted to ask you, could I join the band? I know you'd have to talk it over with the rest of the guys, and I know it would cause some problems. Like, on the road, we'd have to have an extra motel room and stuff, but -- - That is important, we do travel a lot. - But I'd add sex appeal and that's an important component in maximizing profitability in core and target audiences, and I like you a lot. - As commander of this band, I approve your request. - All right! - Ah, thank you. - You're welcome. Anyway, I want ya to tell me everything about the band, like who's your manager? - Uh, we don't have one. We haven't been here very long. - I figured, 'cause some manager would have snapped you up a long time ago. I mean, your sound is really great. A little spacey, but really great. - Dee Dee, I... I'm an alien. - Well, that's okay, there's lots of English bands. What about Menudo? We'll get you a good immigration lawyer and you'll have your green card and citizenship papers in no time. - No, I mean, I'm from another planet. - You mean you're from... And not...? And I fell for someone from...? - Exactly. - Wow. But ya know, I guess it's not surprising I'd fall for an alien, Lois Lane fell for Superman. There have been lots of mixed couples like that. There's Fay Wray and King Kong. I still can't believe you're an alien. What a novelty act. - This is gross. When was the last time you lubricated this thing? - I don't know. - Yeah, never. - Did you see where they went? I didn't see where they went. - I don't know. - They went in the booth, didn't they? - Yes. - We both...we both saw that, right? - Right. Hold it, man, I think I know what happened. Acid flashback. - What? - Now everybody listen up, I've got an announcement to make. As of right now, The Pack is dissolved. I said listen up. No more brutal beatings, gang fights, head stompings. The fun's over. - Come on! - Now listen man, you're gonna have to get your kicks without me, all right? Listen, we've had some good times, right? - The best. - Man. - And I paid a high price for 'em. Dee Dee and I are through. - Oh, man. Frankie. - Man. - Please, Frankie. But Frankie. - Need I elaborate any further? No more violence. - Where are we? - This is my ship. - Video games? - So, ya happy now? There's no more Pack. There's no more violence. There's no more you.

But ever since I met you, I haven't thought of anything except becoming a member of your band. - I've been thinking about that, too. Would you like to come to my planet? - Your planet? Yeah, we could get a book deal, paperback rights, miniseries, toys, t-shirts, posters, the whole works. - Wait a minute. How do you feel about me? Do you love me? - I think so. - Whew, I'm glad to hear that. You'll like our planet. Of course, you'll have to get an emolectomy. - A what? - An emolectomy, it's just a minor operation to take away emotion. Everyone on the planet has one. It greatly simplifies existence, especially around income tax time. - But what about love? - There is no love on our planet, nor hatred. - You're kidding. - No, the operation takes it away. Of course, after this relationship, I'll have to go in for a recharge. - But with all the emotion gone, how can we have, you know... sex. - Ah, that. - Yeah. - Don't worry, on our planet we have sex almost every night. Almost Monday, almost Tuesday. - Maybe I don't have to have one if we're going just to visit. - It wouldn't be just for a visit. - No? - No. - You mean I'll never see Speelburgh again? Heidi High? Frankie? - That's correct. - All of my friends are in Speelburgh, I really couldn't leave for good, not even for stardom with you. I'd be making a terrible mistake. See ya later. - Wait! - Wrench. The 12 and three quarter open end. I see you never took auto shop. - No. - It's okay. - Dee Dee. Dee Dee, is that your asthma acting up again? Whoa! Hey, hey, stay back! What are you doing, huh? Hey, hey, man, you better watch out! I got a lot of people backing me up, man. Hey, hey! - This is a bunch of shit. I don't see no Frankie and you can't disappear in no damn phone booth, ya hear me? - I told ya something weird was going on with that phone booth. Dino just disappeared. - There's something really wrong here. - Wait a minute, I thought you said one of those creeps was with Dee Dee when they disappeared. - Right. - I don't think those creeps are from our world. - Yeah, I kinda thought they were from Cleveland. - I mean another planet, bonehead! This could be some kind of invasion. - Yeah, well, what are we gonna do about it? - I tell ya what we're gonna do about it, we're gonna stop 'em. - Right. How? - Frankie? Frankie! - Dee Dee, get back! Hey, hose head, are you goin' AC or DC, or do you like going with both, huh? - Frankie, look out! - I said stay back! Hey, who unglued your chassis, huh, man? - Bummer. - Frankie! - Hey, Dee Dee, look out behind you! It won't budge! Come on! - Frankie! Come here! Oh, my God! - Get back! - Gnarly. - You want me to give it the first pull? No, I really can't. - For me. - I'm really flattered. But just this time. Here it goes. Well, give it a try. It's Dee Dee and Frankie, help 'em! You were terrific. You wanna go take a little walk? - You bet. - Do you know that guy? - No. Frankie... I love you. You're so down to earth. - Here, put this on.

Pretty snazzy, eh? - Sheriff, I don't know to drive this thing. - You're doing fine. - What is that? - A bazooka. - Hey, you two, get out of the way! - Oh no, a quadruped.
