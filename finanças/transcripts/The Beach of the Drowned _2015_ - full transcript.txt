THE DEATH OF A FISHERMAN - You're not going in? - He's asleep. Leo's here. Hi, Uncle. How are you? Good morning, doctor. Doctor. Any news? - I don't understand. - What are you saying? Add that doctor to the list of idiots. Add that doctor to the list of idiots. Do you really keep a list of idiots? - You didn't know? - No. Need a ride somewhere? It depends. Where are you going? Home. You don't want me sticking around here. - Can you bring me back tomorrow? - Sure. It's from the last harvest. See what you think. It's good. And it's still not quite ready yet. It's very good. Do you write them all down in there? Not all of them. I stopped updating it last year. It was too much work. Every year? Hold on. Hi, Rafa. What's up? - Where are you, boss? - Why, is there a problem? They found a man's body on a beach in Panxón. - A sailor? - How should I know? Will you be long? The forensic asked us to go pick him up. Then go pick him up. By myself? What about you? Me? I'll be here until noon at least. Okay, fine, then. I'll go. All right. Hello. Rafa. You missed the fun. Where were you? - Have you eaten? - No, I'm not eating today. Well, I'm starving. Come with me and fill me in. When I got there the body was out, foaming at the nose and mouth. A sailor? His name was... Justo Castelo. People in town call him El Rubio. He went out in his boat on Sunday morning and he showed up today floating on the shore. Was he alone? His hands were bound with a plastic zip tie. Suicide? The forensic says no. Why? - Sure you don't want some? - No, no, really. This can't be the first drowned body you've seen. No, back home they wash up in the river sometimes, but... I don't like them. - And this Castelo... - Justo. Justo Castelo. Did he have family? No wife or kids. But the mother and sister live in town. The sister's coming later to identify the body. Did you talk to her? She didn't say anything? None of the neighbors? Nobody. What do you think? This always happens. People here open their mouths and nothing comes out. Sorry. Sometimes I forget you're one of them. Rafa, come in. Come in. I can say beforehand he drowned to death. It doesn't take an autopsy to see that. He had puddles in his lungs, so... he was alive when he fell in the water. Did Rafa tell you his hands were tied with a zip tie? Yes. And that you don't think he tied it himself. No. It wouldn't be the first time... No, it was somebody else. Why? How would you tighten a zip tie? I don't know... - With my teeth. - Exactly. And it would close here, above your thumbs. - Yeah? - But in this case it was below his pinkies. - It could have moved after. - No, no. Look at the wound. Too tight to have moved. And another thing. Most of the injuries you see are postmortem, but there's one inflicted while he was alive. His hair covers it, but it's more or less... this shape. He was hit by something long with a ball on the end. So you're saying first they hit him, then they tied his hands and threw him in the water. In that order. - And the time of death? - Well... Two, three days. He was last seen on Sunday morning, right? Yeah. Three days then. Okay. - Clara Barcia has his things. - Right. Those are the clothes he was wearing and these are his belongings. His keys, his Lady of Mount Carmel medallion and a figa. - A what? - It's an amulet. A figa. Nothing else? I also found a little bag with white powder in his pocket. - Drugs? - I suppose. It was wet, I sent it to the lab. - This is the zip tie? - Yes. I'd never seen one like this. Me neither, but I couldn't find anything to identify the manufacturer. Chinese. - Everything is lately. - Yeah. - What happened with the boat? - I don't know. Excuse me, Inspector. The sister is here, Alicia Castelo. Clara? Hi, I'm Inspector Caldas. - I'm very sorry about your brother. - Thank you. He came over on Saturday. He came almost every night to see my mother. She's got physical problems and lives with me. My husband spends months at a time at sea and we keep each other company. Was your brother okay? He was the same as always. Had he argued with anyone? Was he worried about something? No. No strange new friends? Drugs? I don't know what you've heard, but Justo quit that long ago. Long ago is...? Years. Okay. Go in there with her. Caldas. The powder in the bag is salt. - Salt? - That's what they said. - I'm leaving. Bye. - Okay. Bye. Is there any more squid? We closed the kitchen. Hey, Carlos. Why do you think someone would carry a bag of salt around with them in their pocket? I don't know, Leo. I give up. Why? It's not a riddle, I'm really asking. Go to hell. I'll get you some octopus. - Yes? - Leo. You didn't show up. I couldn't make it to the hospital. How's Uncle doing? - Well, okay. - Good. I have to be in Panxón tomorrow first thing. I'll try to stop by on my way back. CAPTAIN SOUSA Eight hundred. Come on, it's getting late! Come on! Here we go. Two and a half kilos. And a half? Two and a half, Arias! Or do I pay for the box? - Hermida. - Here. The one with the beard and the beret worked with the dead guy. Two kilos two hundred. The other one in orange is Jose Arias. Here we go, we're starting with the shellfish. We've got great crabs and barnacles. Starting with barnacles at 80 euros. 80, 79 1/2, 79, 78 1/2, 78, 77 1/2, 77, 76 1/2, 76, 75 1/2, 75... - Yes. - Over there. Two kilos two hundred. Take them away. Take a look. - Okay. - Good. Are those pregnant females? They are, but it's not compassion. You've got to fish to eat, buddy. Yeah. When was the last time you saw Castelo? We were together at the auction on Saturday. Was he okay? Same as always. And Sunday? We don't fish on Sunday. Yeah, Castelo was seen taking out his boat. If you say so. Watch your feet. Thanks. - Can I give you a hand? - No, that's okay. And... was Castelo in trouble with anyone around the port? Actually we didn't talk much outside the port. - So the relationship was bad. - Not bad or good. Well, then? Life, pal. We've sold everything. We're not here to buy anything. I'm Inspector Caldas, from Vigo. We're here about Castelo. No market on Sundays, right? We all rest on Sundays. But people saw Castelo go fishing on Sunday morning. No, not fishing. He left the baskets behind. I wish he'd gone fishing. Dying on the job is one thing, jumping into the sea yourself... How scared do you have to be? Scared of what? Nobody's told you about Captain Sousa? No. Inspector. Who is Captain Sousa? Are you going to talk to Hermida? Should I talk to Hermida? He's the one who knows the whole story. Not now, thanks. Captain Sousa was the captain of the Xurelo. A fishing boat, about 20 tons. Like that one. - How's that going? - Finishing up. Great. Careful, it's slippery here. They used to fish a few miles north from here. On a stormy night about 10 or 12 years ago the Xurelo crashed into a rock. The sailors saved themselves by jumping overboard, but not Captain Sousa. He sunk with the ship. - He drowned? - Yes. What's that got to do with Castelo? El Rubio was one of the sailors on that ship. I still don't get it. Listen... Look, Inspector. Strange things are going on around here lately. Captain Sousa's boat appears in the bay at night. What? It appears sailing in the bay at night. I thought it sank. We're talking about a look-a-like, right? Yes. Knock on wood. I saw it. One time, but I saw it. Near the lighthouse. It was far away, but I'm positive. And they say El Rubio saw it too. I think he jumped in the sea because he had a guilty conscience. Now if you don't mind, I have to work. Yeah, sure. Thank you. Ask around and see if anyone saw Castelo's boat leave. I'll go talk to his sister. Damn that sailor and his fucking superstition! - What's wrong? - He spit on my boot, damn it. It's for the funeral. How is your mother? Bad. Were you able to sleep? That was last year. He caught an ocean sunfish. Those were his 15 minutes of fame. A TV crew even came and interviewed him. - Would you like some coffee? - Yes. I was about to make some. Thanks. - Sugar? - No, no. I take mine black, thanks. You asked me yesterday if I noticed anything odd in my brother. Justo came over almost every night to see my mother. He didn't talk much, but he spent time with us. He'd sit by the window and... he'd start whistling. A couple of weeks ago, one day, he sat down like he always does, but he didn't whistle. And we'll never hear him whistle again. He might have been worried about something. What I do know is my brother didn't kill himself, Inspector. He would never cause my mother that much pain. Some of the neighbors have talked about Captain Sousa. I don't know if you've heard of him. Yes. My brother sailed with him for three years. The Captain helped him give up heroin. We can never repay him. Their shipwreck was on October 4th, 2001. Justo and the other two sailors were young and survived, but the poor Captain... What happened to the other two? Marcos Valverde married a summer vacationer and stayed here in town. And Jose Arias left for a job in the North Sea. Arias? I met an Arias at the fish market. He came back a couple years ago. But he said he and your brother didn't talk. That night changed their lives. - Need a hand? - No. A woman saw Castelo leave at 6:30 in the morning. Alone. It looks like his boat is the only one that sailed on Sunday - because of bad weather. - What about Sousa? They say he was threatening Castelo. That's what they say. - Need a hand? - Threatening how? Graffiti on his boat. Castelo turned white when he saw it. - May I? - What did it say? You try. We don't know because a carpenter came in from Ribeira and erased it. Damn it, Rafa! What do you want? - Where does the carpenter live? - He has a workshop in the port. El Rubio brought me the boat three weeks ago. Something was written on it in red letters. He asked for sandpaper and paint and covered it himself. Did you read it? There was a date. October 4th... I don't remember the year. 2001. Could be. I think it said "murderers" underneath. Murderers? Yes? Hello, this is Inspector Caldas. I'd like to talk to Marcos Valverde. - He's not here. - Can I talk to you? - Yes, I'll open for you. - Thank you. Damn. Nice house, huh? You like it? We bought it two years ago. It belonged to an architect from Madrid. It was hard to persuade him to sell it, but Marcos knew I liked it and finally convinced him. He has a talent for that. Please. - It's very pretty. - Thank you. But winters here are rough. I spend all year wishing the heat and people will come back. What does your husband do? Too many things. Construction, gas stations... Now he's making wine. He spends all day in that bodega. - We heard he worked at sea as well. - Yes. But Marcos doesn't like to talk about that. He survived a shipwreck in which a man died. In fact, the sailor whose body was found yesterday was a part of that crew. Did your husband keep seeing him? No. Marcos doesn't talk to any of them. I think he avoids them on purpose. As a defense mechanism, so he won't... So he won't remember. But you did know Castelo. Yes, I bought shellfish from him sometimes. I get along great with his sister Alicia, the schoolteacher. Thank you. It's some of the best in town. Was your husband worried about anything lately? Marcos is always worried about something. Did you know Captain Sousa? And what they say about him. You can't keep secrets in a small town, can you? But he told you that... My husband has no time to be superstitious. Sure you don't want me to wait? No, go and find out who sells those zip ties. Look who's here. Hey, Calditas! What a surprise. Staying for lunch, right? Of course he is. You're not the first Caldas I've talked to today. I'm not? Your father called me asking for the name of some idiot. Yeah, he's got a list. He calls it his list of idiots. He's still doing that? I think he started when your mother was still alive. It looks like retirement is treating you well. A doctor never retires completely, but I can't complain. I have time to fish every day now. You're in Panxón because of the drowning. Yes. Did you see the body? No, they don't call me for that anymore. Was there anything odd? I don't know. It looks like a textbook suicide. Justo Castelo was a strange guy, a loner. Tying your hands first means he wanted to do it right. And addiction usually causes depression over time. Yeah, he had a bag with a strange substance, but in the end it was salt. That's a good luck charm. Salt? Yes. Some prefer amulets, others a bag of salt. He had both. You think it's because of Captain Sousa? There always was something strange about that shipwreck. First because it was a bad night to sail, and Sousa wasn't careless. It makes no sense that they didn't take shelter at a port. Where did the ship sink? - Here, near Sálvora Island. - Sálvora. Another mystery. They hit rocks anyone who's been there twice would know. Captain Sousa had to know they were there. His body was found weeks later in the nets of a fishing boat. Were you there when they raised the body? No, they sent him to Vigo. A forensic there must have handled it. But someone identified the body, right? Of course, his wife. She was his only family. And she died shortly thereafter. She hated those three boys. She said they didn't lift a finger to save her husband. You think so too, right? All I know is before the shipwreck they were very close and after that they separated. Something must have happened to them. A shipwreck is something. Something else, Leo. Normally shipwreck survivors create lifelong bonds, like soldiers in the trenches. And those three stopped talking to each other. El Rubio closed himself in his shell, Arias emigrated to Scotland and Valverde never went near the port. You've spoken to them, right? To Arias. Valverde wasn't home. I talked to his wife. He's not doing bad at all. No, he quit fishing and started building houses. Look at what he's done to the town. Rationalist architecture is their answer for everything. Others go into the wine business. Did somebody say wine? Yes, but he's not like your father. Valverde went into wine-making for the prestige he couldn't get in construction. Your father didn't give a shit about prestige. Those clams look great. Go ahead and complain. Can you drink or are you on duty? - I'll try it. - It's your father's. Even more reason. Okay. Did I ever tell you about my trip to Newfoundland? I don't remember. What a bad time you had in Newfoundland! Look, wait. Look at this photo. Is this you? Yeah, and the other guy is Sousa. What's he got there? He called it the "macana". It was like a rod with a ball at the end. I suppose he took it with him. Got any more photos of him? He's got nothing but photos! - Look, here's the whole crew. - Let me see. Valverde, Arias, El Rubio and Captain Sousa. Take the folder. I took those a few weeks before the shipwreck. How is your uncle? So-so. - He'll be okay, you'll see. - I hope so. Nothing. No sign of those zip ties anywhere. You see? I said they were rare. But several sailors swear they've seen the Xurelo sailing through the fog in the middle of the night. Hold on, wait here. You going out fishing? I'm going to replace some baskets. Why didn't you tell me you and Castelo had sailed together? You didn't ask. Did you know someone painted the date of the shipwreck on Castelo's boat? Yes, and they wrote the word "murderers" on it. I don't know what they wrote on El Rubio's boat, Inspector. Nobody wrote anything on mine. Yes? Let's go. Yes, go ahead. We're on our way. THE CREW OF THE XURELO I've hardly spoken to Arias or El Rubio all these years. Why did you stop seeing each other? You must have heard about our shipwreck. More or less. What happened? The sea was very rough that night and we were heading home. Captain Sousa was at the helm trying to stay on course and we were with him on the bridge, trying to hang on. Until that wave hit. It raised us in the air and I heard the hull snap when we fell. The boat flipped and before I knew it we were in the water. And the Captain? We never saw him again. I don't know how we swam all the way to the shore, but we did. Were you wearing vests? Yes, we wouldn't have made it without them. The Captain was too? El Rubio offered him one when things got ugly, but Captain Sousa was a tough guy. All he could think of was saving the boat. Right. If the sea was so rough, why didn't you try to dock in a port in that area? Probably because we were carrying a full load, but you'd have to ask the Captain that. Yeah, sure. What happened after? We each went our own way. El Rubio kept fishing, Arias left town soon after and... I tried my best to move on. You've done all right. Don't let it fool you. I haven't always lived in a house like this - and I never got a free ride. - Of course. Certainly. Did you know Captain Sousa has been seen sailing in the area? I wish. Castelo must have doubted more than you do. He had tons of amulets. I don't know his beliefs. You can't control fear. But you're not afraid. Not of those stories. But you know, to this day... it's still hard for me to set foot on the shore. I was convinced they'd hit him with a tube wrench, like for tightening nuts on a tire. But it could have been this. Are there more photos? Yes, but this is the best one. Antonio... Antonio Sousa. Antonio Sousa, boat owner. - Drowned in 2001. - That's right. Appeared in a fishing net. The crabs devoured him. - Great. - He's completely disfigured. He could be anyone. DNA tests? He was wearing the same clothes, the same medallion. No need. Hundreds of sailors have the same clothes and medallion. - His widow identified him. - The widow? - The widow wouldn't even look. - Sure. She was in a hurry to bury him. Want do you want to hear, Leo? He wants to know if it could be someone else. With the same clothes, same complexion, same medallion... Is it possible? We're leaving, right? Another glass? One. By the way, the bag with salt is an amulet. I remembered yesterday after you left. I hadn't seen one since I was a sailor. WOMAN MISSINGIN AGUIÑO NO NEWS OF SUNKEN BOAT OWNER IN SALVORA FISHINGBOAT SINKS IN SALVORA - Morning. - Morning. Justo Castelo's phone records just came in. He got calls from a booth in the port. The calls lasted less than 4 or 5 seconds. There's more. Guess who the last person he called was. Jose Arias. He's probably asleep. He was out fishing all night. Then he can get up. Arias! - Forget it. - Arias! - Forget it. - Open up, damn it! We'll come back later. Arias! Open up or I'll kick the door in! Hey, what's the problem? - Nobody's here. - Jose Arias lives here, right? Do you know if he's home? He's not deaf. He came in early this morning but he went out again. I don't think he'll be long. Thank you. You said you never talked to Castelo. That Saturday you spoke on the phone for 8 minutes. - Who says? - The telephone company. What, this isn't your number? He'd lost a buffer and he wanted to know if I'd found it. A buffer, a buoy. Sometimes they come loose. And it took him 8 minutes to ask you. Let's go. Rafa. I believe him. Damn right I believe him. "Where's my buoy?" "What buoy?" Wham, bam, boom, 8 minutes talking about the buoy and it never goes anywhere. Did that ass belong to Valverde's wife? - What's up, Clara? - Hi, Leo. Castelo's boat appeared. Where? Some kid scuba diving found it by the lighthouse in Monteferro. - Are you still in Panxón? - Yes. We're on our way. The sailors here call this place the swimming pool because the rocks underwater form a natural wall around it. Where's the boat? There, submerged. With a hole in the hull. Whoever sank it didn't want it found. Wouldn't it be better to sink it far away? No, the currents at sea would have dragged it to the coast. The sea down there stays still. The only risk was what happened, a scuba diver found it. But not a lot of people dive this time of year. Normally it would get covered with seaweed and stay there forever. Is it possible for a body that drowned here to show up on a beach across the hill? I don't think so. But we'd have to ask someone who knows these currents well. The lighthouse is up here. El Rubio's body was found on this beach. The current runs in this direction. Therefore, if he'd drowned at the lighthouse, the sea would drag it that way, never back to the beach. Understand? Yes, more or less. I was about to go fishing. Why don't you come with me? You'll understand it better at sea. Come on. - What's up, artist? - Good morning, doctor. It's turning out beautiful. This kid is phenomenal. Living proof that man is God's finest handiwork. I was looking through old photos yesterday and I found this. There's your mother. I thought you would like to have it. Look. It's the perfect place to hide something. The sea below is calm. But only people from here would know that. - You can go ashore here. - Yes, and that. It's the only place on this side of the hill where you can go ashore. But I thought we came out here to fish. Let's go. We can't fish while we're moving? Not sea bass. Then fish for something else. Look, the lighthouse. Hermida says he saw Captain Sousa sailing near the lighthouse. You think we might run into him? I don't know. But some things you don't say on a boat. - Let's go back. - Empty-handed? Stop bugging me and hook this bait. What is this? They're alive! Of course they're alive! Well? How does it feel to spoil an old man's day fishing? How are you? So-so. - Ready to go? - Wait. What are the chances of me getting sick again? Still got anything left in there? Did you catch anything? Garbage. Old bottles, bags... Look. Even a wrench for a car. I'll get a steering wheel one of these days. What? Wait a second. Look, there's a road up there. Call and have someone drive you back. You screwed up my day enough already. So we get seasick as well, huh? Here. For the forensic. Feeling better? Did you take the wrench to the forensic? I was just there. He says the shape coincides, he'll confirm on Monday. But I don't think anybody hit him with it. If the shape coincides... Yeah, but it's like hiding the boat right next to the hill... It was the best way to keep the remains from surfacing. And you can go ashore there with no witnesses. If they go to the trouble to sink the boat, why not bother with the weapon? Because there is no murder weapon, Rafa. Everyone believes Castelo killed himself. Period. He drowned. And if the zip ties hadn't been thumb-high, we would have thought the same. So we still have nothing. We know he was terrified of Captain Sousa. If he was hit with that wrench, Captain Sousa's rod is irrelevant. But there's also the graffiti, the amulets, the calls... And it had to be someone who knows this coast perfectly. Have we checked for cameras in homes on the way to the lighthouse? No. Clara... Damn, Leo, you sure were hungry. I hadn't eaten anything since lunchtime. I only got seasick once, in the Indian Ocean. The Indian Ocean? How many years were you a sailor? Fifteen. From age 24 to 39. And you know where the prettiest women were? In Mombasa. Mombasa. Kenya. Listen, if you were sailing near Sálvora, for example, and you got caught in a storm, where would you seek shelter? Go to hell. I'm talking about Mombasa and you bring up Sálvora. Sálvora is here. I guess I'd go to Ribeira, it has enough depth for a merchant ship. No, a small fishing boat, big enough for two nights at sea. Then I'd go to Aguiño. Aguiño? I would say so. Aguiño, Aguiño, let's see... A fishing boat shipwrecks in Sálvora... Here it is. "Woman missing in Aguiño." "Rebeca Neira, age 32, missing from her home." Rebeca Neira, 2001. "Rebeca Neira was last seen with two strangers." - Yeah? - Rafa. I think they were in Aguiño. The night Captain Sousa drowned a woman was reported missing in Aguiño. She was last seen with two sailors. - What time is it? - Listen to the description. "Young, thin, blond hair wearing a dark blue fishing suit." It has to be Justo Castelo. Pick me up tomorrow? Tomorrow? Tomorrow is Saturday. At eight. Who was it? Who do you think, sweetie? Who do you think? Come here. Okay, crabs for sale! 39, 38.50, 38, 37.50... Where's Arias? Here, take these. 35.50, 35, 34.50... 34, 33.50, 33, 32.50, 32... 32... He called about the fucking buoys! That's not why I'm here. Nobody can explain why Captain Sousa didn't seek shelter in a nearby port that night with the storm. Are you sure you weren't in Aguiño? I can't answer that. It's possible. Then why did he set sail instead of waiting out the storm? I can't answer that. Because I wasn't the captain. I was only a sailor on that boat. Take it easy. Have you ever heard of Rebeca Neira? Who is Rebeca Neira? A girl from Aguiño. She spent part of that night with a sailor. - Do you remember her? - No. - No, I've got it. - Thanks. One thing, Inspector. Go ahead. - Today's Saturday, right? - Yes. I shouldn't be here. - Me neither. - Don't fuck with me. You're the reason we're here. We couldn't wait until Monday? - There's no fish market on Monday. - So what? These people won't disintegrate because there's no market. You don't care if it's Sunday, Monday, morning, night... It's the same to you. You just call without asking if the rest of us have things to do. If this is about last night... Last night, tomorrow, the day after and so on, damn it. - I didn't know what time it was. - So what? It's not our fault you have no life outside of work. Let's go. Like I said, the hull was full and that was the captain's priority. - But you docked in a port. - No. Are you sure you weren't in Aguiño? Let me think back... If I remember correctly, we did stop for fuel that night, but I can't say if it was in Aguiño. - Is it possible? - Yes, it's possible. You never mentioned it. You were with a woman, right? - With a woman where? - Where do you think? In Aguiño. No, of course not. A woman was seen in Aguiño with a blond sailor. Could it have been Castelo? Look, frankly I think it's impossible. Like I said, we stopped for fuel. It couldn't have been that long. Should we go to Aguiño? No, we'll go on Monday. - You sure? - Yeah. Hey! Look who's here. You look great. Shall we give him a glass of wine? What are you celebrating? That his nephew finally came to see him. Okay. He's going home tomorrow. With oxygen, but he's moving in with me at the ranch. You're going to put up with him? I'll let you know when he gets released so you can give me a hand. Hey, Leo... What was Aurora's boyfriend's name? Which one? The one who was a total dumb ass. Jaime. Jaime! Diego Neira reported her missing. He was her son. He was a minor then, a woman from town went with him. And he's the only one who saw her with the sailors. And what happened to her? I don't know, the file only says she was reported missing. Thank you. That's where Rebeca Neira and her son lived. So what? Not a peep, huh? They moved away a few years ago. Luckily the officer who filed the report still lives here. I'm not on the force anymore. I'm retired. We're investigating the death of a sailor. Here in Aguiño? It could be related, yes. Look. In the report Diego Neira refers to a blond sailor. We think it could be him. They shipwrecked a few miles from here, in Sálvora. The captain drowned. I don't know how I can help. Well, we'd like to talk to Rebeca Neira or her son. - We know they moved away. - No. Rebeca left that night and never came back. - She didn't? - She left with a man. Who? Whoever came along. She was like that. But you looked for her. For a while. Until someone said they'd seen her somewhere. Was that confirmed? And the kid? He vanished too, after a few days. I think his mom came for him. But he didn't withdraw the report. He was probably too ashamed to admit it was all just his mom having another boyfriend. Does the woman who went with him still live here? Here you are. You'll get better in 3 days. - Okay, thank you. - Goodbye. Goodbye. - Yes? - Good morning. Good morning. I'm Inspector Caldas. This is Officer Estevez. We came from Vigo. The robbery again? No, no. We're trying to locate a woman who lived here. Her name is Rebeca Neira. I don't know if you knew her. We know she doesn't live here anymore. No, Rebeca doesn't live anywhere. She died? No, she was killed. When? In 2001. That night Rebeca went to buy cigarettes at the bar in the port. Like she always did when she ran out at night. Diego fell asleep on the sofa, watching a movie. We can't go to my place, my son's there. My son's there, we can't. Diego thought he was in the way and he left. Diego... Diego! The poor kid didn't know where to go. It was late. He stopped and he saw one of the men go inside. The other man went back to the port. He had blond hair. Diego thought he looked foreign. The report doesn't describe the man who went inside. He couldn't see him. We never found out who they were. Diego thought they were sailors but they couldn't be. The boats were docked because of the storm. Any ship that came in that night would be in the port the next morning. And there weren't any. Right. We put up signs everywhere. We organized search parties for days, but nothing. Why do you think she's dead? Because she would never have left her son. And Diego saw a stain. He thought it was blood. That's not in the report either. He thought nothing of it at the time. And they didn't tell the policeman...? Somoza. - Somoza? - No. Somoza had a problem with Rebeca years before. He was always a pig. Rebeca reported him for trying to take advantage of her. Nothing came of it, but Somoza never forgave her. He doubted everything Diego told him at the station. He humiliated him. - He did nothing to look for her. - And the boy? Diego Neira? Where can we find him? He moved in with his grandmother soon after. Up north, in Ferrol. He used to call me sometimes... He still had nightmares about the blond man. - Are you still in touch? - No. He called 7 or 8 years ago to say his grandmother had died. He said he was leaving, but didn't say where. You wouldn't have a photo of him by any chance...? No. Can I ask why you're interested after all this time? Of course. This is the crew of a boat that sank a few miles from here that night. In Sálvora. They could have been in Aguiño that night. The blond one was murdered a few days ago. We're investigating his death. You think Rebeca was on this boat? - Thank you very much. - Thank you. Goodbye. So they had a good reason to sail during the storm, huh? Yeah. What I don't know is how he found Castelo. Panxón is south, and he moved miles north, right? I don't know either, Rafa. What I do know is Diego Neira had a good reason to kill El Rubio. Arias! Open up, damn it! Nobody will answer. He left. A couple of days ago. With a suitcase. Are you really policemen? Yes. You're here about El Rubio? - Exactly. - Poor kid. The other day he was standing right where you are and the next day he was dead. What? Castelo was here? He came to see Arias? That's what I just said. - Did you hear them talk? - Poor kid was desperate. Did you hear them? No. But you could see it in his eyes. I think he'd already decided to kill himself. - He left after talking to you. - We know that. But you're wrong to look for him. He wasn't involved in Justo's death. They had no relationship. Did you know they spoke the day before your brother died? My brother isn't the one who called Jose Arias that day. It was me. I called him from my brother's house. I only lied to protect myself. I'm married and this is a small town. It's not just the call. Your brother went to see Arias the evening before he died. That's impossible. - Arias didn't tell you? - No. Where did he go? I don't know. I only hope he doesn't take 11 years to come back this time. Let her go. I don't know what else to say. I've told you everything I remember. You knew the graffiti on Castelo's boat had nothing to do with Captain Sousa's life. I don't understand where you're going with this. We were just in Aguiño. Rebeca Neira disappeared the same night you shipwrecked. Two sailors were with her at her house. One was Justo Castelo. Who was the other one? Not me. That's not what he asked. I'm telling you, I don't know. What else do you want me to say? Arias? Was it Arias? You can speak freely. He left town. Covering up a crime is a felony. Listen, I'm not covering up anything. But I can't tell you what I don't know. I know how he found him. How? El Rubio caught a rare fish. I saw the newspaper clipping at his house. The sister said it was even on TV. When? I don't know, last year. It was today, wasn't it? I'm sorry, Dad. I'm sorry. So you're not coming? No, I can't today. Maybe tomorrow. Sure, tomorrow. Arias is listed as a passenger on a flight Sunday morning from Madrid to Glasgow. - He has a daughter there. - Ellin. - Yeah, something like that. - File this. What else? - His criminal record. - Rape? Injuries. The last time he trashed a bar in Baiona. It took a patrol to bring him in. - No wonder. And the kid? - Another ghost. You think he went after Jose Arias? Trying to run always gets you followed. I hope he's in Scotland. I'd rather someone else arrest him. Me too. What else? Clara's looking for you with photos from a camera near the lighthouse. The camera is at a house before the fork in the road. It has a motion sensor. Luckily there isn't much. This is at 6:05. A Land Rover heading for the lighthouse. - We want cars leaving the lighthouse. - I'll show you what I've got. The next one is at 6:30. A hooded man walking down from the lighthouse. Too early. Castelo was already in the sea by then. The last one is at 7:30. The 4X4 coming back from the lighthouse. - There's nothing else? - No. Wait a second. Put on the guy walking again. Can you enlarge it? What is it? It's the same guy, walking and in the car. Can you put both images together? - It could be. - Let me get this straight. A car goes to the lighthouse at 6:05. And the driver leaves on foot at... - 6:30. - 6:30. And one hour later the same driver drives back down again. Yeah, but we never see him go back for the car. He must have crossed the hill, or the camera would have seen him. Rafa, who saw Castelo's boat sailing on Sunday? - An old woman from there. - Ask her how he was dressed. What was he wearing when you pulled him out of the water? A blue raincoat. We're sure it's the same car? Yes, I checked before. A Land Rover with a scratch and missing a side mirror. He was wearing the usual fishing suit. Was he wearing his hood? Excuse me, was he wearing his hood? Yes. Thank you. The man in the boat wasn't Justo Castelo. Can you explain what's going on to me? He must have trapped him on Saturday night, got all the information he could out of him, hit him, tied him up and dumped him in the water. Then he needed an alibi, so he made everyone think Castelo was alive on Sunday morning. The bastard leaves his car at the lighthouse, dresses up like Castelo and goes to the port. He lets people see him, grabs Castelo's boat, goes to the lighthouse and sinks it there with no witnesses. Then he gets in his car and leaves. - You know who it is? - Diego... Diego Neira. Barcia. Valverde's wife wants to talk to you. Put her through. No, it's not a call. Thank you. Show it to me again, please. What's wrong? Did something happen? - Someone destroyed our gate. - When? A couple of hours ago. - Did they break in? - We don't think so. But I won't sleep there. - You're here to report it? - Yes. My husband didn't want to, but I do. He doesn't know I'm here. Inspector... I'm worried about my husband. Your husband is there? - Looking for a carpenter. - Don't worry. I'm afraid something might happen to him. Don't worry, we'll take care of it. Take her statement, please. It's okay. Thank you. Someone tried to break into Valverde's house. The kid? Looks like it. Let's go. Go with Ferro to Panxón. Someone must have seen that Land Rover. Check it out. Yes, boss. I don't get why he broke the door. It was easier to jump it. Rafa! - What are you doing here? - We wanted to talk to you. - Did anyone break in? - No, just broken wood. - Need an officer to stand guard? - No. Thanks. They're coming to fix the door and I'm installing an alarm, that will be enough. Castelo's dead, Arias left. If someone's out for revenge, you'll be next. Caldas. I'm grateful for your help. - Someone call a carpenter? - Yeah, in there. You need to wear a helmet. Clara and Ferro are already here. They talked to a police chief who knew Diego Neira. And? Apparently Diego Neira had an accident some years ago. Yeah? - The hole was to break in. - What? Remember the kid with the kite on the beach the other day? He had an orthopedic leg, remember? Of course. He can't jump over, so he broke the door. Exactly. Exactly. Let's go. Boss, they're here. - Call me when you've got something. - Clara, what's up? I've been talking to Traffic for ten minutes. There are no green Land Rovers registered in this area. Did Rafa tell you we got a call from Ferrol? Yeah, Diego Neira's accident. He had to break Valverde's door to get in with his orthopedic leg. I think we've located him. - Orthopedic leg? - He's not lame? - What about his accident? - But he hurt his hand. He cut his fingers with a saw. He was a carpenter. - He built boats... - Boats! Prepare a unit, we're going to Valverde's house. Rafa! Diego Neira! We were in Aguiño. We're here to take you in. Put that down, Diego. Are you stupid or what? You heard the inspector. Put that down. Son of a... Come back here! Rafa! Rafa! Come here, damn it! Come here! Why are you running? Why are you running? That's the girl's son? Yes. Why did he come after me? I didn't do anything. Not doing anything isn't enough. What did he want? Me to end up at the bottom of the sea like Captain Sousa? You want to come with us and tell us what you know? Anytime. We reached port and had dinner on the bridge like other times. Arias was drunk when that woman showed up. Look, look. Check her out. - Land ho! - Very nice! Land ho! Gorgeous! I was looking for one just like you! Come here! They both left with her and Captain Sousa and I went to sleep. I couldn't tell you how long they were gone for. I remember the waves crashing woke me up. Then I went on the bridge and... and I saw him. Arias. He was at the wheel and Captain Sousa was at his feet, badly injured. There was blood on his head. A few minutes later he set course for the rocks. We put on vests and we jumped in the water right before we crashed. What happened to the girl? There was something bulky on the deck wrapped in a blanket. Arias told El Rubio to wrap it in a chain. And he threw it overboard. Thank you very much. That's all. You think he'll stick to his story in front of Arias? I don't know. He's terrified of him. What do you think about the kid? He refuses to speak. He looks like he's in shock. All he said is he didn't kill El Rubio. Do you believe him? No. If they let me, you'd be talking. We know about your mother. We know she didn't abandon you. We just took a statement from Marcos Valverde. He told us everything that happened in Aguiño that night. Was it him? Arias. Where is he? Will you catch him? I hope so. What did they do to my mother? Your mother is in the sea. Near Aguiño. Are you going to look for her? I can only promise that I'll do what I can. Are you going to let me go? Are you going to tell me what happened to Castelo? I don't know what happened to him. I didn't kill El Rubio. Or the graffiti? Yes, the graffiti was me. So he would confess. I wanted to find the man who killed my mother. And do what to him? I wanted to ask him why. Look. I put myself in your shoes and I get why you'd want to kill all three. In my shoes? The judge will believe you if you say you tried to squeeze a few names out of him but he slipped trying to escape. There was nothing you could do. You'll be out of jail in no time. Diego. I'm trying to offer you a way out. You're not offering a way out. You want me to take the blame for a death. And I didn't kill anyone. Thank you. ...also jewelry, watches, designer handbags, computers and cell phones valued at more than 200,000 euros. In Vigo, the 8th District Court sent 26-year-old Diego Neira to prison without bail, accused of killing Justo Castelo, the sailor whose body was found on a beach in Panxón two weeks ago. The news of Neira's arrest, who works as a ship carpenter in the town in Pontevedra, caused surprise and dismay among the locals, who had always considered the sailor's death a suicide. According to reports on Galician television, revenge could be the motive for the crime related to the accused's mother's disappearance 14 years ago in Aguiño. New evidence suggests that the woman, whose whereabouts has been unknown since October of 2001, may have been murdered on the same night two crew members of the Xurelo disappeared while fishing in the area. The carpenter, who confessed to harassing the victim for months, was arrested at the home of businessman Marcos Valverde, who belonged to the same crew as the criminals, but authorities have ruled out his participation in the crime. The search for Jose Arias continues in Scotland relating back to events in October of 2001 when with the help of another sailor he killed Rebeca Neira, missing since, and whose body could have been dumped in the sea. They arrested Arias in Scotland. Did they take a statement? He admits he was very drunk, but all he remembers is how cold the water was. - When are they bringing him? - I don't know. Soon I imagine. I wanted to tell you I'm taking a few days to rest. Sounds great. You should rest too. And open the window. Hey! Lift it up, that's it. Good. Here we go. Okay, let's see. Where did you get that zip tie? The Winery Owners' Association sent me samples. They sent these to all the winery owners? Yeah, why? Take me to Vigo. - Now? - Yes, now! I'm very grateful for all you've done for my husband. If it hadn't been for you, who knows what might have happened. - He's over there. - Thank you. I heard you caught Arias. Yes, in Scotland. Congratulations, Inspector. You two aren't leaving here without a case of my best wine. Your wife says you have a talent for getting anything you want. And she's right. But I bet she doesn't know that a young girl named Rebeca Neira put up a fight. Excuse me? And probably also doesn't know that Captain Sousa also stood up to you because he didn't want to sail on a stormy night. They both paid for it with their lives. I bet you never told your wife any of that. I imagine you can explain these insinuations. Yes. I have Arias' testimony. Arias. So now Arias has decided to accuse me. Him of all people, when he vanished after the shipwreck and ran away from the kid. - Arias was running from you. - From me? A man like Arias running from a man like me? Arias only looks strong. He would never lift a finger against you knowing that you're capable of anything when something gets in your way. Castelo was different. Castelo wasn't afraid of you anymore, but he wanted to sleep peacefully at night. How dare you come to my house and accuse me of something like this without evidence! - Take it easy. - Don't touch me. Take it easy! We have the tube wrench you hit Castelo with. You didn't even bother to toss it in the sea. Of course, who would ever investigate some poor bum's suicide? My car is here. Go ahead and check and we can stop wasting time. Yes, we'll check everything. But tell me one thing. Was Justo Castelo here on Saturday afternoon? Here, at your home? He might have brought shellfish for my wife. Sometimes she bought straight from him. All I know is on Sunday I saw him on his boat and that Sunday I was in my bodega first thing. There were people working with me, ask anyone you want. If it's your bodega calling, you should answer. They're probably calling to warn you that we have men there with a search warrant. Like I said, we're going to check everything. Everything. How did we miss that a ship builder doesn't need a boat carpenter to fix the front door of his house? It's funny. We came here to protect you and we saved the poor kid from ending up like his mother, at the bottom of the sea. Yes? It's your bodega. - Yes. - We have the car, Inspector. And the tube wrench is missing. The fishing suit and zip ties are in the trunk. Good. It's all there. Not going fishing today, huh? Not until the tide comes in. I heard you were in court this morning. Nearly two hours. They gave me your message and I'm grateful, but there was no need to apologize. I think there was. Like poor El Rubio. He came to my house the night before that asshole killed him. To apologize, or get it off his chest. Besides the graffiti on the boat, he was getting calls every day at all hours and... He couldn't take it anymore. He said he was going to talk... even if it meant he might get arrested. They both killed her? No, just Valverde. Wake up! Hurry up, come with me. What for, damn it? El Rubio had been asleep for a while on the boat when that bastard came in and woke him up. And he convinced him to help him clean house. Rubio. But they carried her to the boat together? Valverde hit Sousa so he could sail, headed for the rocks and the rest you already know. And why did you leave? Because Valverde threatened he would pin her death on me if I ever talked, I'd already had problems with the law... Which of us would they believe? - Will you leave again? - No. I'll stick around here. Until the tide comes in. Until the tide comes in. Yes, sir. Until the tide comes in.
