Today, I suddenly see the light. I promise, to choose a wonderful day to marry Xiao Lei. If I regret, I'd be cursed, I'd be punished, and I'd never be forgiven. This is a bit cruel, don't you think? If it's not cruel enough, will you make up your mind? Uncle. Xiao Ling. I hope, you are not that kind of guy who would back out at the last minute, right? Of course not. I just remember, I have a international flight today. Sorry, I'm late. This is a big event. I'm telling you if you don't sign this today. The harm you did to Xiao Lei would be like an airplane crash. You'd be responsible for ruining and breaking up the family. You'd be cursed to be hit by cars. Cut the crap. You sign, you go. What's wrong with your parents? What's the matter A surprise attack? What's wrong with it? These three years I kept asking you to meet with them You never said yes. They came to visit Beijing without telling me. I couldn't stop them? I was in a hurry, so… But they went too far! What are you yelling for? Why did they go too far? What about them? They almost…killed me cooked and fried me as if I was the slaughtered lamb They tried to eat me. Early in the morning, I was frightened out of my wits My spirit strayed away, It hasn't come back yet! What do you want me to sign? The marriage certificate? What was that? This is called the violation of human rights. It's forcing me to marry you. Have you ever thought about.... marrying me? Don't head off the topic. Answer my question. Why the rush? Marriage, is for those who are lack of a sense of security and who don't have any confidence in each others That piece of paper to tie down each other is that really necessary？ You said you love me So let's get a legal document Is it really that hard？ What are you afraid? Are you saving yourself, a retreat? I'll be 30 years old soon.

Mom. Dad, mom, I'm to blame for all this messy trouble this time. Well, It's Haixin's fault to bully them. It's because of me that she's so domineering and savage When I got divorced with her dad I was afraid she'll be bullied by others. When she was in primary school, I was afraid she'll be bullied by the boys. After she grew up I was afraid she'll be bullied by men. So… But she married Dapeng and I was relieved, because Dapeng is a good guy. He could always give in to her. But Dapeng, Why didn't you hold yourself, either? When she said divorce, You just need to hold yourself for two days and she'll be fine. If her dad could endure me for two days then, I wouldn't be like this now. OK, stop crying. Bravo. I'm proud of you. Thank you, sir. What's you plan after graduation? I hope you could stay here and join in the best symphony orchestra in Italy. I'll think about it. That's great. Excuse me for a minute. Fine. What's wrong Sorry. I had the wrong person. It's fine I heard you two are getting married after being together for seven year. How romantic! Thank you You're so beautiful I'll ask your fiancé to come over and marvel at you. Surprise I came back so soon. Your Master is not here. Don't come here again. I'm not looking for my Master. Why are you here? My Master asked me to send a few words to his wife. Ex-wife. Ex-wife. Go ahead. Dear Haixin, Just regard me as my Master. I had always believed the relationship between us could last forever. But I didn't expect we'll broke up so easily. I'm not ready to leave you. I believe you are also at a loss as well. Therefore, here are several things that I have to entrust Erdan to tell you, your careless little thing. I hope you could keep them in mind. The water card, electric card and gas card are in the rightmost drawer of the bookcase. You can see them the minute you open it. I have helped you buy a yearly quantity of them. At least for the next year, You don't need to worry about them. Before I left, I had changed the bed sheet and quilt for you. Mrs… Mrs… Ms… Any more? Should I go on reading? I'll go on. Before I left, I changed the bed sheet and quilt for you. The rest are in the wardrobe and placed according to the color. Remember to change them every week. Don't forget it.

Hello miss, what would like to drink? Water. Do you know? In my childhood, I liked to stir up hornet's nests and felt cool for doing so, because it seemed to make me like a real man. When I grew up, I became a pilot and I flew a large plane. I thought it required the utmost courage all over the world. So far, I have found that these things were of little importance to me I was really afraid. I was afraid that I wouldn't find you during my lifetime. I was even more afraid that another man, would hold your hand and put the wedding ring on your finger. I won't give anyone else such a chance. Now, I realize that the real courage is to hold your hand and spend the rest of our life together. Gu Xiaolei Marry me! Let's get married Yeah! Oh, yeah! Wenwen, Standing in front of you, I've worked up the nerve to make it. I have known you for two years. And I have fallen in love with you secretly for seven hundred and thirty days. I would have told it to you, if you had not seen that manuscript. The love I have for you will become my most cherished memory, deep down in my heart forever. Over two years, you have become a rich source of inspiration of all our wedding veils. You said that when the man you loved proposed to you, he should prepare ten wedding veils for you to choose from. I have prepared hundreds of and even thousands of wedding veils for you. No matter, if you will marry me in the future, the wedding veil you wear is the best one that I ever designed. Especially, at the moment when you put it on, I know although I am not the one that matches you best, surely I am the one that love you most. Wenwen, if you'd like, Let's get married. I do. Aunt Yezi, Who are the guests? How secretive are they! When they arrive, you will know. Let's go! Mum Dad Mum Didn't you leave? Haixin, come here. First of all, I'd like to thank all of you. Thank you for helping me with such a surprise without letting Haixin know. Next I will announce that several days ago, we got the license. However, we got a divorce certificate. Why? Some said that it was because Tian Haixin was overbearing, insolent, abusive and self - centered and felt that she was really something in the hotel. They aren't telling the truth. Others said that although Tian Haixin married me, she still thought that I was just a cook, good-for-nothing with the stink of ducks. They are wrong. Others heard that a five-star hotel offered Haixin the post of general manager(Chinese). They made assumptions that Tian Haixin would accept the higher position, leaving both me and the hotel alone, She walked out on me by the way None of them is right. In fact, It was because of me, Cao Dapeng, a selfish man. What I care about is my roast duck and a comfortable life. I have never thought about her and what she wanted. I and Tian Haixin have known each other since we were sixteen years old. It was quite hard for both of us to go through many challenges until today. Haixin's father, when she was young, left her and her mother. I knew in my heart that she was starving for affection. But my love is not deep enough. Loving her means no matter what happened, you should cheer her up, tolerate her and cherish her. When she wanted to divorce me, I Can by no means consent to it. Haixin Due to my deep love for you last time, I tried my best to marry you. Now I found I made a mistake. It was not enough, because the right way is that as I married you, I should wholeheartedly love you. So I want to remarry you. I promise that no matter what happens from now on, I will manage to love you deeply. Haixin, let's get married. Are you satisfied? Is Xiaoxiao ready Go and have a look. Uncle Zhang. Haixin. You're here You are pregnant, but you are still busy with those things. I have no choice, It is my cousin's wedding. I have to help him with those things. You should take good care of yourself. Take your seat. Ok, would you like to drink some water? Thanks, go ahead please! Don't mind me if you are busy. Would you like a Chinese wedding or a western wedding? I prefer the western one, simple and modern. Good idea! When you get married, I will give a performance for you. No problem. Wenyi, would you like to join us attending the wedding? You can share the good fortune, would you? Sorry, take your time. I just want to walk around. Ok! How beautiful! I want to prevent the wedding veil from splitting again What on earth is fate? Among thousands of people, you meet the right one, you meet the right one, and through thousands of years, with the boundlessness of time, neither earlier, nor a bit too late, at the right time, you happen to meet the right one. That is the fate. Now Let's invite our bride to the stage with warm applause. The bride walks at a gentle pace. Her father, with a sense of reluctance, is handing her daughter over to the man of the same importance in her life personally. At the same time, our bridegroom is waiting anxiously for his spouse predestined by the fate. Excuse me I just want to ask Now you are sitting here Who is driving the plane?
