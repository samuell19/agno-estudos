The Case of Dr Laurent Who's that with the suitcases? He's not a local. He could be an engineer working on the river. He was on the Paris train. He's a salesman. Excuse me, do you know Dr Bastid, from Saint-Martin? Do I know him? He fixed my arm and was there when my dad died. Have you come to see him? No, he was supposed to meet me. If I were you, I'd get on the cow. Pardon? That's what we call the St-Martin bus, because of the horn. - It'll be along soon. - OK. Look who's arrived! - Francine de Rancurel! - Had she left? Didn't you know? Right after the scandal. Did you hear it? If you want to get to Saint-Martin, come with us. The doctor must be delayed. Thanks. Take care of yourself. If he wants to see me, he can cycle. But if he's tired, he can use the telescope! After you. Thank you. Didn't you know? She was in Saint-Saviol, with widow Escalin. That's where she had it away. With the son. Lovely boy. Wasn't he engaged to the Lambesque girl? - She had a good dowry. - He had a good time! The marriage was off. Widow Escalin threw her out. I understand the lad. Engaged to a prune, he'd be attracted to a nice peach. Is it far still? - We're nearly there. - Thank you. I think he's an inspector. - He's meeting Dr Bastid. - So? - He could be his replacement. - I was hoping for a younger man. Young or old, he won't make a fortune here. Even the crows carry their lunch with them. - Anyone for 4 Chemins? - Yes! My regards to your father. If I was her, I wouldn't have come back. Not far now, sir. If you look, you can see the lights of Saint-Martin. - Doctor Laurent? - Yes, madam. The doctor is with a patient. He asked me to meet you. And here I am. The boy will bring your things. Hurry up. - He can't take them all! - I was working at his age! - Your... - I'll carry my bag. - I'll lead the way. - After you. See who's here? The doctor's replacement. Apparently he's from Paris. Don't you think it's odd for a Parisian to come here? - Maybe he's running away. - Does he have a beard? - We've lost the boy. - He's gone round. He'll meet us there. - Is it much further? - Right at the top. Mind the steps. The stream goes through the village. Don't step in it. It comes from the mountain. It's cold! Help! It's Catherine Loubet. A difficult labour. The doctor's there. It's not going well. He's coming out backwards. - What are you doing? - Moving the foal. I don't want him to get frightened. He's nervous, it could affect him. Come on. Go up and see him, if you're not too tired. He could be a while. Is he the new doctor? Poor man! Sorry, sir. Dr Laurent, Dr Bastid's successor. Is he here? - Are you a doctor? - Yes. We could do with you. She's in such pain. Is it your wife? I'll never forgive myself for this. This way. What shall I do? Kill it or not? - What? - The pig! - I don't know. - It's for the christening! Excuse me. - Mr Laurent! - Doctor... I recognised you straightaway. I wanted to come to the station, but the best-laid plans of men... Mrs Loubet, the mother-in-law. - Mrs Rébot, our midwife. - Doctor. - She's calmer. - I'll give her an injection. Do you want to examine her? Childbirth isn't my speciality. I haven't seen one for a while. You'll see enough soon! - This way. - After you. I won't. She doesn't want to see me. What have I done wrong? She isn't having much luck with her first. It's breech. She's in such a state... Yet she's an educated, intelligent woman... She went to school in Grenoble. She should have the upper hand. Education, intelligence... What can we do? We must leave it to nature. Sometimes nature needs a helping hand. I was going to give her morphine. This syringe is empty. - What is it? - Don't worry. I'm Dr Laurent. Did he call you in? Is it serious? No, don't worry. I'm his replacement. From Paris. Paris? Help me, doctor. It hurts! You can't imagine how badly. No one can. It's less now, but it'll come back. Since this morning. I'm exhausted. I'm going to die. Help me. What an idea! People don't die from childbirth now, come on. You're tormenting yourself. Won't you see André? He'd be so pleased. No! I don't want him to hear me screaming like an animal. Not my husband, doctor. Tell him to go. He's gone, he's gone. It's starting again! My baby is here. He wants to come out, but he can't. I'm too small. They'll cut me open. My mother died giving birth to me. Now it's my turn. Save him! I sacrifice myself. We've all been sacrificed, my dear. It's always been like that, it always will. It's our lot. You have to resign yourself to it. Don't say that, madam. You should never resign yourself. Especially to suffering. Here's the injection. You must be tired, go and rest. I'll stay the night. Thanks to you, it may be the last time. Help me... The boy has put your cases in your room. This is the lounge. The doctor's surgery. There's the dining room. Door to the cellar. And that's my kitchen. I'll show you to your room. It's the nicest room: it was his wife's room. Very nice, very nice. Don't you want something to eat? No, thank you. I'm tired. - Doctor... - Yes? I wanted to ask you... I've worked for Dr Bastid for a long time. I'm old, but I'm still active. And I'm not deaf. I can run a house. This house... is my house too. Will you keep me on? My name is Célina. - Didn't the doctor talk to you? - No. I'm not very well, I have chest problems. Don't worry. It's not that bad. It's early days. I'd rather you knew. When you're ill, it's better if someone knows. There might be times when I'm tired, or depressed. I'll need you, so if you'd like to stay... I'll get you another blanket. Don't worry. You'll soon be better. This isn't Paris. The air's purer here. Well? Is it a boy or a girl? A girl. Poor thing! She might not survive. Catherine suffered all night long. The noise she made! The birth was at 6 in the morning! She's all battered. They used forceps. Mum, what are forceps? Be quiet. Go and play! - She'll find out soon enough! - I hope not. I had 6 just like that. What's all the fuss? You're like a cat! Not a bad example! Cats screech when they make love, not when they have babies! - And the new doctor? - What's he like? - Nice. - Is he married? I don't think so. There's a vacancy! With a doctor you won't have children! Dr Bastid is introducing him to everyone! Mr Guillaumin, our mayor, who should look after his liver. Mr Béranger, who fulfils your prescriptions, in other words, the pharmacist. Joseph, a carpenter, like the saint. Mr Bertrand, the headmaster. This winter he had serious lung congestion, which we cured. Mr Simonet, as healthy as the bread he makes. And Mr Rousse, who's fine because he doesn't do anything. Nice to meet you. I wish you good health. I'll need a consultation. - A consultation? - About playing boules. Let's have a drink. - After you. - No, after you. He's not like Dr Bastid. He's nice, for a Parisian. He's not that young for a replacement. Young doctors fill up the cemeteries. Pity he doesn't have a beard! Here's to your wife and daughter. - What's her name? - Marie-Joséphine. My wife wanted to call her Joséphine. It was her mother's name. Tell your wife to rest quietly. I'll come round this evening. You should rest too. He was worse than her! I didn't think it was so awful. It's not that bad. All women go through it. - Shall I kill him? - Who? - The pig for the christening. - Yes! Alright! Let's continue with our tour of the property. Goodbye, gentlemen. He said "property". It's us he's selling. It's like your sheep. We can choose who we see. I don't think we'll lose out. Let me introduce you... Here's your kingdom. 20 square kilometres, 2,000 people. Scattered hamlets linked by poor roads. You'll soon get to know them. Beneath us, at 500 metres, surrounded by farms, is the village of Saint-Martin. And 25 kilometres that way, the sub-prefecture, where we have a hospital, clinic, and dinners amongst colleagues. All this is yours. It'll be a change for me. I'm used to gasometers, factories, barracks, the canal. A free clinic, you know. Poverty all day long. A diagnosis, a word of comfort, and send them to the specialist, the hospital, the sanatorium. I didn't own my patients. I was responsible for them. I remember, my boss used to say: "Medicine is all about love." He was right. But... I think you need to change your routine, research, invent. Yes, well... You have dreams when you're young. You want to save the world! It's not a question of age. Let's have a drink. There's a farm over there. Here we are. They're simple folk. They're a little ashamed, because of their daughter. Hello, Mr Triot! - May we have a drink? - Please do, doctor. Thank you. His wife used to be my cook. Then she married this poor devil. They had a child. A beautiful girl! She had to leave. - I think she's back. - Back? Francine! Come over here! She's embarrassed. From what I hear, it's not her fault. No. Hello, Mrs Triot! Could we have a glass of water? Hello little one! Let me introduce my replacement, Dr Laurent, from Paris. - Hello. - Hello. Go ahead. - You want to drink your water? - Mine? Yes, yours. Don't you remember? The doctor had our spring tested. He wanted to create a spa for the poor, and a little dam, with electricity for 1 penny a day. - You wanted to help everyone! - Yes, and I learned my lesson! Yes. And we didn't get our spa. Nor do we have electricity! I didn't know your daughter was home. There was nothing in town. I told her: you work here and speak to no-one, or you go back. - Did he drink? - A bit. When ill luck falls upon a house! He was born a week ago. His mother has rejected him. She had such a hard time, the poor thing! Like a woman! - We understand! - Yes. I'm giving him a bottle. If I put him near the ewe, she kicks him. Francine's trying to reason with her. - Reason with her? - Animals are like people. They understand when you talk to them. Where's your baby, Tita? Your little one? You chased him away? You're angry with him? I know you were suffering. But it's not his fault. He can't defend himself. He's innocent. He's weak and naked. Like a baby. What's she saying? You should trust me. When you hear the gate, you run over because you know I'm going to feed you. But we can't feed him. And he doesn't just need food. If you abandon him, that will be it. She might try now. Doctor, you're needed! By whom? Ah, it's you, Félicien! We've been looking for you. Luckily, I saw you come this way. Catherine Loubet isn't well. You hurried here! - I had a race with Gaston. - Very wise! We're training for the Provence race. You should learn how to breathe properly. Do you cycle? No. I used to box, when I was a student. - You never said. - I haven't told you everything. Tell him to go. My baby... I can't hear her. She's next door. - She's dead! - No. She's sleeping. - I want to see her. - Not now. She's tired. She had a hard time too. My life, my darling! It's not right that she's suffering! They say children are innocent. Why are they punished? Don't upset yourself, madam. We'll look after your daughter. We'll reduce your fever. You'll get your strength back. You must trust us. I do trust you. I've just called. We'll take you to the clinic. They don't have a room until tomorrow. The doctor himself will come and fetch you. I don't want to go. I can't leave her. She needs me. - Please. - Don't argue, Catherine. Listen to your doctor. I'm listening. You want me to obey, you don't understand. I don't want to go alone. - You husband will come. - I want my daughter! If I go, I'll never see her again. I want her to come with me. The doctor agrees. Once you're better, if you get ill again, he'll look after you. For now, listen to me as if I was your father. I'm still in charge. Hello, Célina. Is the new doctor holding his first surgery today? Yes. It's the old nameplate! Come in! You're second. Will it be busy? Market day is busy. But they're not really ill. Sorry. They come for miracle cures, and you don't see them again. I didn't say anything, but they're intrigued by a Parisian coming here. They ask me: "Why did he come?" To work! If I didn't work... Be punctual, you'll be judged on that. And your appearance. You should wear a blue suit, with a medal. Do you have such a thing? The priest has his cassock, the judge his robe, the soldier has his uniform. We should have ours. I don't have a medal, and I don't care about clothes. - Your statuette is fun. - It's a souvenir. A lovely souvenir. 9 o'clock! I'll leave you to it. If you need me, I'm in the dining room. OK. Thank you. Who's first? The first person, please. Hello, miss. Come in. Take a seat. How's the little lamb? All's well now. You're a great doctor! What's the matter with you? Is Dr Bastid here? Do you want to see him? He's here. Doctor, it's for you. Go through. - Hello, doctor. - Hello. - She's happy now. - Who? Tita, the ewe. I don't suppose you came here to tell me that? No. Who's first? - Doctor. - Hello. - Please sit down. - Remember me? Mr Bertrand, the headmaster. I teach the younger ones. I deal with school meals. - And I'm secretary at the town hall. - That's not an illness! What's wrong? Here are my x-rays. I have a stomach ulcer. Dr Bastid said I needed an operation. Can it wait until the holidays? Being away from the school, preparing for exams... I do. Since my wife died, I don't have time. I make do: tinned food, tomatoes... I cook potatoes to last several days. Well, then! That's great for your ulcer! Are you sure? You know as well as I do! You didn't need to come. Don't start crying now! What's wrong with women? You're happy enough when you're young. Then it's goodbye freedom! But I loved him. You shouldn't love someone above your station. Nor beneath it. Is that why you went to Nice? To try to... No. For work. But work is hard to find in Nice. I wasn't so desperate that I'd... do things. What does your father say? He doesn't know yet. I don't know how to tell him. I'm worried about him. My mother will cry... But she'll be happy. But him... Operate, operate! We can try and deal with the cause. Here. But... I can't cure you on my own. Are you sending me to a specialist? Yes. You. You and I will cure you. You'll help me. And help yourself. Ah, I understand! The psyche! Not entirely, but medicine has moved on. Is there somewhere you could take meals? Yes, there's Marthe. The postman's wife. She takes lodgers. She cooks well! Nothing complicated, but tasty. Do you think... You seem better already! Don't worry! - Mr Bertrand... - Goodbye, doctor. Dr Bastid asked us to leave this way. Really? Oh... - Goodbye, doctor. - Goodbye. - Hello, doctor. - Hello, Mr Bertrand. What's so bad she couldn't tell me? She's pregnant. - What does the father say? - Her father? The person responsible! He won't honour his obligations. He isn't a bad lad. But he's weak and dependent on his mother. And she keeps a tight hold of the money. He was supposed to marry into a rich family. What a world! And this doesn't happen in Paris? Yes, it does. - How many months pregnant? - Three or four. - When's she coming back? - Coming back? It'll be the 8th or 9th month before she's back! Maybe at the last moment! Women here don't consider it an illness. We need to explain it's important for them. And the child. Leave it to nature! She knows what she's doing! I thought you wanted to build a dam at the farm. How is that relevant? A dam isn't leaving it to nature. - It's helping it. - It's not the same. You're worrying me. Come in. Dr Ripert. - Hello. - Mr Laurent, my replacement. Mr Ripert runs the clinic. - Hello. - You're from Paris? What made you leave the capital? I didn't work in the part of Paris you imagine. You might come to regret it. I've just seen the stomach. When is he coming in? I don't think it's necessary yet. Why not? Haven't you seen the X-rays? Yes, hence my conclusion. How is Mrs Loubet? The ambulance is taking her. She insisted the baby went with her. - May I phone the clinic? - Please do. She'll need a transfusion. When you leave it to nature... Once the practice is yours, you can do what you like. When will it be finished? The lines are tricky. So I see. You've done them 3 times! Mistakes happen! Since you asked, can I ask you something? For a while now, my hand has been trembling. Let me see your eye. - What's wrong? - Take a look in the mirror. There's nothing wrong with my eyes. What colour is the white? It's yellow. My advice is to add water to your wine. - Water? - Yes. If you carry on drinking, the shaking... Just saying. Célina, get rid of this. The Zephyr? You can't throw it away! It's bronze! I don't care if it's gold. Here's my list of visits. If there's a call from Paris, tell them to call this evening. - Paris? - I'll start with Simonet. For his burn. Carrioux for the grandfather. Maïssa, Gauthier. - Which Maïssa? - The asthmatic. Catherine Loubet is home from the clinic. She's still not doing well. I'll call in. I'll go to the town hall to see Mr Bertrand. What can we do for her? She doesn't seem any better now we're home. She went through a lot. She'd get better if you were calmer. I am calm. I've never been so calm. I was upset at the start of my pregnancy. I felt so ill. So ignorant. - Then I understood. - Understood what? It's been like this since the world began. You have to accept it. It's the role of women. Maybe our greatest. Hello, doctor. How do you find my two ladies? We'll have them both on their feet. Let yourself be spoiled a bit. - A drink for the doctor? - Not for me. - A little marc! - Nothing for me! My father makes it. It does you good. You can have a little. - Your husband loves you. - And I love him. But it's as if nothing's happened. You'd understand. You're sick too. They were talking at the clinic. I don't talk about it. I feel much better, anyway. Did I wake her? Leave us. Doctor, did you know that having a child could be a curse? When he comes near me, I want to cry out. This may be none of my business, but does your daughter sleep next to you? Yes. - And your husband? - In the room next door. You'll make her miserable too. Her place is not in between you, like a wall. She should be in this room. And your husband here. I thought you were a doctor, not a priest. You're very interested in doors. What about the one you came in by? I thought I was helping, I was wrong. Forgive me. Goodbye, madam. - What are you looking at? - The ages of the deceased. 78 years, 5 months. 41 years, 15 days. There are more people in the registers than in houses. The Mayor is happy to let you use the town hall, but he doesn't know what you want to do. And nor do I. I want to give a talk. Make people more aware of their bodies, medical progress. Starting with the women. You think people will come? You can lead a horse to water... I don't know about men. But... Women! I have things to tell them. If you talked to them about love, or how not to have children... Mr Bertrand, you educate children. It's your job, you go through a lot of trouble. But who brings them into the world? - The doctor! - Mothers. Women. I see where you're going. Eugenics. Do you know how many women are pregnant locally? How would you expect me to know? Someone might be able to tell you. If it wasn't said in confession, I can tell you. We've got: Fernande, Blanche, the hairdresser's wife, Mariette... She doesn't come to see me, but it's common knowledge. Big Margot... from Bénévent. She must have six. But... some died. - How many is that? - Four. Young Odile, who married the butcher's son 3 months ago. I don't know, but it's as good as. The Mayor's wife. I'm well informed, because of Easter. Many came to see me. - How many is that? - Six. I'll think of some others! Noémie, the guard's wife. - Seven. - That's all I have! - I know one more. - Who? I wanted to ask you... I hear you have a gramophone. - Is it new? - From before the war. It plays very well. It has a stylus. I need it to play 33s. It can do more than that! Will you be playing music? Maybe. I've been a midwife for 30 years. I know my job! My conscience is clear. And then a Parisian comes and criticizes me! Is it my fault she suffers? No! But women give birth with no pain, thousands of them. I'm going to Paris to see it. Paris! Do they have children differently there? I know about deliveries! Not like you! I heard you. You told Dr Bastid you never did any. - What are these new inventions? - I'm trying to explain! Take this. It'll explain. I'm not interested. No one is interested! You'll be talking to empty seats! We'll see! Call Dr Ripert in an emergency. Otherwise, the pharmacist. - Must you take this plane? - I have to be back in 2 days. Thanks. Bye. Good heavens! Pain-free childbirth Entrance free He isn't here! Where can he be? What he saw in Paris was nonsense, he daren't come back. Are you going to the show, Mrs Millot? I'm not sure it'll be a show, no one's going in. Good evening, Fine. It's a lovely evening. We're taking the air. And you? Taking a walk. The doctor isn't even here. There he is. - Good evening. - Hello, doctor. Sorry, I had mechanical problems. - Many here? - Outside! The gramophone. - Shall I set it up? - Yes, please. I warned you, doctor. You can lead a horse to water... - Are you going? - Why would I go? Quite right! Are you interested in the mysteries of nature? I can tell you everything! Leave me alone! You just want to have fun. This is for us. He's got a gramophone. He's no competition for us. Denise! Put on the television so we don't miss the match! - What match? - Light-heavyweight championship! And now, ladies and gentlemen, it's time for sport. - Shall we go in? - There's no one there. I'm going in. I wonder if they'll go. Pain-free! They're like kids hoping for cake. And Francine? Will she go? Isn't she scared? Why would she be? Love isn't a crime! Now she's paying the price. I don't understand you! Francine! - It's starting! - We're in the arena... The match! The spectators are up. The 2 opponents... We're 2 minutes into the 1st round and neither has the advantage... They said: "They won't come!" You don't know me very well. I haven't been here long. But before coming here, I worked in a clinic in the Paris suburbs. Now whether it's the city or the countryside, the problem is the same. Life and death. My job is to delay death as long as possible, and to bring life without it being a drama, for both mother and child. The night I arrived in Saint-Martin, I saw someone, who is here, moving his foal in the middle of the night. Why? Because of Catherine Loubet's screaming. My little foal is so nervous that he had colic! No! Don't laugh! A good master looks after his horse. But the woman screaming, did we look after her and her child? No. I know what you'll say. Women have always suffered giving birth. In the past, yes. But not today. I've just come from Paris. In one day, I saw 3 women give birth in a new way. Their stupid match! I saw all three deliver their babies without pain and without crying out. All three were amazed when the child appeared. Do you know what they did? They laughed! They laughed because they were so happy. Now I know. I'm sure of it. Women can give birth without pain. The curse is gone. I have a gramophone. I'm not going to play music. But I have a record. - Here it is! - What? He's playing a record! A record which was recorded in the delivery room, during a birth, by a woman who wants her experience to help. Today, you learn to give birth as you learn to read and write. You, madam, have learnt to knit. You've learnt to ride a bicycle. A sportsman preparing for a match trains his muscles, he learns to breathe. Then the big day arrives. Childbirth is a match too. You'll give birth without pain, but not without effort. The champion going into the ring has quite a job ahead. She too, for months, will have been learning to use her brain and her body to manage her delivery. I talked about a match. You won't be alone. The doctor will be your manager. He'll explain clearly what's going on, how to bring your child into the world, how your brain tells your body what to do. The first battle is with yourselves. Prejudices. Fears. Superstition. You're crossing your legs. If you were expecting a baby, what would they say? The cord would knot around its neck. Exactly. And you, what if you suddenly had stomach ache? The baby's hair is tickling my stomach. Exactly. What about cravings? And the incredible advice! The terrible stories. The fear of caesarians. Forceps! So comes the time, she expects pain, so she cries. Forget all that. You need to know how you're made, what it's for, and how it works. It isn't unhealthy curiosity. What's he saying? Election promises! Pain-free childbirth! What's he doing? You shouldn't discuss some things. You don't go looking in chamber pots! And then there's someone else. Someone you couldn't rely on. The person walking up and down and smoking. He sits down, he gets up. He's in a worse state than you! The husband! He won't be staying in the corner. He'll be involved throughout. He'll learn the same lessons. He'll be proud, and you'll be happy. If you don't have a husband... That can happen. The family and the doctor will take his place. - I wonder how many went. - What? To the talk. Honestly! You're fretting over nothing. Over nothing? All the baby and I went through... And now us... That's nothing? Catherine! - Is it my fault? - It's not your fault. But I can't help it. My mother brought me into the world. - She didn't blame my father. - What do you know? Listen. I've been a good husband, you loved me. Now you look at me like I'm a stranger. It's too much! André, try and understand. - I understand! - André! You call for the doctor, but the illness is in here. The best time of my life was when I was a girl. Marriage is the end of freedom. May God take my life, but not make me live it again! You're spoiled! You've got a car, music... Music... Relax your legs, relax your arms. Completely. Roots of the hair. Eyes... nose... Head... chin... Shoulder. Gently. First shoulder. Shoulder. Now the second. - Arm on your stomach. - Incredible. You can see him. He's not completely out. It's incredible. - There. - It's great! - Here. As I said. - I'm not in pain. It's amazing, doctor. We'll put him on your stomach. It's a girl! There. I hope it will be as wonderful for all women. I don't know if you're expecting a child, or want one. Having a child is the most incredible thing. I'll be there for you. For those who wish, I'm organising group classes. Husbands can come. It will be free. So what's the risk? I've finished. If you have any questions, please ask. No one? Don't be shy! No one? Fine. If you need me, you know where I am. I'm a bachelor, but I support you. I'll encourage them to come. Group lessons won't work. They won't want the other husbands to be there. Well done! You don't know me, I'm not from here. You'd think at my age I wouldn't be interested. I came because of my husband. You'll hear about us. Thank you, madam. Watch out with your colleagues. Why? They might consider it advertising. May I say something else? Please do. You should wear a dark blue suit. Mrs Vanol, the wife of the doctor who lives over the mountain. I want to learn. When you said "people who don't have a husband", you meant me. You'll learn fast. Thanks. Thank you. Know what I just heard? The doctor's giving lessons to Francine. Francine's pregnant? - Decent women won't go! - What about her father? They say he struggled to accept it. - How was the hare? - Delicious! Not a word to the gendarmes! You seem better. Not too tiring to come up here? No, on the contrary. You always cut them so thin. As a kid, I used to look through them. One day he cut one thicker, and I said: "Dad, I'll never see you again." He gave me a slap! Time for class. - We're not used to going to class. - It's been a while. Me neither. I'm not sure I can do it. Once you've decided to learn, the rest is easy. When you see a mountain like that, you think you'll never climb it. But as you get closer, you find tracks, passes, paths, footsteps. You leave the obstacles behind and reach the summit. - That's true. - Of course. When you look things in the face, they're less frightening. When you don't know what's going to happen... The gendarmes. What do they want? My God! Where? I was kidding. Even if we've nothing to hide, it's scary. What about the hare? Hunting's closed. - Feeling queasy? - A little. And the gendarmes: if you'd known they were coming, what would you have thought? "Come in, the vinegar's on ice." Exactly. You wouldn't have been scared. Your brain needs to know the gendarmes are coming so as not to fear them. - I understand. - Shut up. When you give birth, Francine, your brain will say: "This is how it goes." I'm not surprised, I'm ready, I'm not in pain. But you have to know what's inside, and how it works. Then your brain takes over and everything is fine. - I see. - Stop interrupting the doctor. Basically, you talk to the ewe first. He's giving us a new madonna. The annunciation between the cow and the donkey. He goes there every Sunday, like he's courting. - It's not for the girl. - No, it's for art. Why bother with a child with no father? I say the doctor's doing good. If you threw stones at everyone who'd sinned, there'd be no stones left to build roads. Here's your money! As poor Mrs Loubet says, pain is part of life. Right, André? Shut up! If we had another, I'd do anything not to see that again. They won't have another as long as they're sleeping apart! Mind you, Mrs Loubet's pain really went to her head. Do you believe in it? What annoys me is men saying it's fine as it is. They're not the ones in pain! - Guillot, seen this? - What is it? An ad from the Parisian. A conference on pain-free childbirth. He should heal himself. He's got every right. If he's giving lessons, even free ones, he's touting for business. I get the feeling he scares people. I've seen two couples who were meant to go to him. The women want me to deliver them. Not to mention Mrs Loubet. - He's no specialist. - Better to advise him... Let him fall on his face! Hello, Paris? A call from Saint-Martin, stay on the line. Hello, Saint-Martin? Paris on the line. Speak now. Documentation's all very well, but I'm on my own here. No, I'm not giving up, but... I saw your work in Paris, but I've never practised! If you could come I'd be grateful. Well, if you can't... If I mess up, it's not only me who's affected. No, I'm not beaten yet. No! Thanks anyway. Goodbye. Three units? Thank you. What? You believe in it, do you? No, don't apologise. It's good of you to tell me. Thanks. Goodbye. - What's that? - A woman's pelvis. - A real one? - Yes. I don't want to see it. - That was a woman's? - Yes. So, you see at first, the child is a prisoner. It's sheltered, like in an egg. Then one day it hatches. Pass me the doll. So you see... it has to pass through there. - That's the hardest part. - The door isn't very big. No. But he has you to help him. And the more I know, the more I can help. A woman in pain during birth can't take care of the child. That's bad for him. If he can't breath normally, he lacks oxygen. Newborns are often half-asphyxiated. That mustn't happen to yours! When a ewe gives birth she changes her breathing. And so will you. Stand up. As you breathe, your diaphragm presses on the baby. You'll learn to breathe more gently. Lie down a minute. I don't get all of it. But sometimes I think I can work it out. I'm ashamed because of the girl. But then I tell myself a good thing's about to happen. Well, of course it is! My husband won't let me, out of respect for his mother's suffering. I'd go, just to annoy my mother-in-law! - I just wanted to say hello. - Thanks. I got a call from the Mayor, Mr Guillaumin. Mrs Loubet wants me to treat her and her daughter. I thought it only right to let you know their wishes. It's their choice. Mrs Loubet doesn't seem to understand your ideas. Basically, is the method you employ hypnosis? No. It's a lot of work, a lot of explaining and trusting people. Trusting people? An ignorant clientele, who would be the first to run you down. What do women want of us? To deliver them skilfully. They pay us to do their work. And you want to make them work! An uneducated girl can't replace a doctor. Such methods don't suit us. We need researchers, yes, but in properly-equipped centres. I put women to sleep. I explain to them. To begin with, I wasn't sure of myself, but I've a patient who teaches me as much as she learns. I see her becoming aware of what she is. And it goes much further than not being in pain. Maybe it's a birth for the mother, too. You surprise me. Surprise is the start of science, old boy. I'm here to get my allowance. I'm entitled. Really? Says who? - The doctor. - What's it to him? You didn't insure me! Nor anyone else. If someone complained... Just try it... you thief! - Thief? - Yes. You wanted to take him away, to marry him. You stole his heart! Now you want to blackmail me, with the child of an unknown father! I came for my allowance, not a baptism certificate. - The rest is my business. - Then keep it! And remember, your father's farm belongs to me and he owes me rent. Threaten me and come September, I'll kick him out! You're nothing but an old miser! When you spend 100 francs, Masséna's statue in Nice stands up and salutes. Antonin! Did you hear what she said? As if it wasn't enough she wrecked your marriage! You should go and see that doctor! Mum, I've had enough of the whole thing! Everyone's interfering. When I go out, they ask me: "When is Francine due?" "Do you help her with her exercises?" Her exercises... Francine! - Hello! - Hello. - Want a lift? - Why not? - It's been a while. - Yes. You go to school together, take communion, then you lose touch. We sat next to each other at school, too. I heard you're having lessons at home now. You don't believe in it? If he'd come sooner, you'd not be in this state. What state? Why can't people leave me alone? He says you should have another child. What's it to him? I already told him to mind his own business. You think he's interested in your lovely eyes? I think he likes me. A doctor always likes his laboratory animals. He needs his white mice and guinea pigs. Sometimes the guinea pig imagines it's loved. Stop. Stop! I don't know if I'm a guinea pig, but I know what you are. And I don't believe you! Morning. They came last night and attached this branch. - What is it? - A fir tree for unmarried girls. Where's Francine? - Morning. - Morning. What's wrong? Nothing. Here, a book with photos. I don't need it! What's wrong with her? She's crazy this morning. So, sulky boots, have you done your exercises? I'm not an animal being trained for the circus! I saw some gypsies with a monkey this morning. He was doing exercises. I've had enough. What is it? What have they been saying to you? - Is it true you don't love me? - Who said that? - None of your business. - What nonsense! I know you're making fun of me. A Rancurel girl's easy to lead on. - You can do as you like with her! - Francine, really! And don't come here again! I don't want to see you! - All right, doctor? - Yes. - There are people to see you. - People? A little surprise. - Good evening, doctor. - Good evening. You don't know us, but we've read the paper. We're the works committee from the Lantosque textile factory. 30 kilometres from here. As the secretary, I thought... Let us tell him, Robert. We thought... we'd ask you... if you'd like to come and give us a talk, too. There are pregnant women there. They're interested. We have a small dispensary. It could be used as a clinic. You're very kind. Thank you. Hello, Catherine. Taking the baby out? - She's so lovely! - How old is she now? 4 months already. Such a difficult birth. Francine may not fare so well. Know where we saw her? At the baker's! Serving! The Holy Virgin in the village! Like a princess! In her state, I pity the baker's. Her state? She's in fine fettle. Thanks to her doctor, no doubt. Haven't you heard? They fell out. Sometimes it's wrong to fall out. Maybe what he says makes sense. Maybe she'll regret it. Maybe. I'll fetch the bread tonight, Célina. Did you know she was working at the baker's? It was me who recommended her. Why? You're too busy to notice. Your idea is like a piece of bread thrown in the river. The fish are all around it, even those who pretend not to be hungry. I'd like to know how it will turn out. So would I. Good goes to the good. Anaesthesia? It's like a piece of fruit. If you add sulphate and arsenic, it looks lovely. But later it will give you stomach ache. A woman who gives birth under anaesthetic feels no pain. But maybe later she or the child will have problems. That's what he said. Maybe they're just fine-sounding words. What did he say about breathing? What should we do? What matters is what's in your head: knowing here what goes on here. Your belly is like a mountain trail to be explored bit by bit. What difference does it make knowing or not knowing? When you don't know... It's like when he arrived in the village. He didn't know anyone. It was night-time. He said: "The roads, people, everything seems dangerous. "It's like everyone hates you." But when you know... It's like the sun coming up. The village isn't the same. You see things as they are and you're no longer afraid. That's what he said. Electricity's a wonderful thing. What worries me is how the baby comes out. Watch this. That's my lampshade! No, it's a woman's pelvis. Her pelvis? Got an old doll? Shop? Shop? Sorry, doctor. Am I disturbing you? You're joking! Is there something you need? - Some bread! - Ah, bread. Of course. You like it crusty, right? Yes, please. Is Francine well? Francine? Yes, very well. - Is she working here? - Yes, doctor. My wife needed a hand. It's not that she's ill... Goodnight and thank you. Evening, doctor. Good evening, ladies. - You're here too, Mrs Triot. - As you see. - Turn the light on, Fine. - May I? Electricity's a wonderful thing! Doctor, forgive us for... not coming to see you. My wife is fearful. We're hopeful and I think she'll soon require your services. Meanwhile she's learning from Francine. She's in good hands. Good evening. Good evening. I'm glad you came. So am I. - I have news. - What's that? - He's moving. - We'll have a look. - Please go up, doctor. - Thank you. Come with us. You come too. I'll leave the door open for the shop. Lie down. Just relax. Can you hear him? Yes, I can. We can do better than that. We'll communicate with him. We'll send a signal, like a miner in a gallery. And he'll answer. Got a candle? Yes. Light it. Breathe like I taught you. Thanks. Deep breath in. Short exhale. Now exhale gently on the flame, bending but not extinguishing it. Without laughing. Once more. He answered! He's alive. Pain-free childbirth by the psycho-prophylactic method involves the physical and psychological education of the mother late in the pregnancy. This method, which is physiological and experimental, aims very precisely to eliminate the so-called inevitable pain linked to the contraction... Are you happy your wife's given birth? Am I happy? No, doctor. Relieved my wife's out of pain, but I'm not happy that she suffered. Don't exaggerate! Exaggerate? It's obvious you're used to it. But my poor wife... I can tell you that the birth was entirely normal. Normal you say? Dr Laurent says that pain can be eliminated. Don't talk to me about Dr Laurent! - He's in the paper. - Again! "The town of Saint-Martin has acquired a new cult..." "...and its high priest is Dr Laurent. "The carpenter is called Joseph." The Pope's statement, an interview with the village madonna. She dares to criticise conventional medicine! A skivvy! They joke: "The Holy Spirit has deserted the medical profession." Enough! Has he heard of the Medical Council? I think something should be done. I've never liked the man. He has no manners. He chopped wood while I spoke to him. It's the moral aspect that interests me. Being mentioned in the papers is advertising. - We must defend ourselves. - And medicine. Defending medicine is defending the sick. Someone should complain. It's difficult. Why not? He needs to be made an example of. That article makes fun of our town! The whole county's laughing at us. They're dragging Saint-Martin through the mud. They mention my name as a carpenter and as Joseph, but I'm proud to live here. Things are happening here you don't see elsewhere! All those movements will affect her milk. - And turn it into mayonnaise! - What if my organs fall out? What nonsense! Can we eat the soup? He makes them breathe like dogs. - We're not dogs. - Breathing's good. - Sportsmen know that. - Sportsmen! You don't have babies riding a bike! Explain it to me, then! It's the brain that hurts! If I pinch you, does your brain hurt? Ask your doctor that! And don't wear out your brain! - The Pope recommends it. - That's why I'm against it. I'm in favour, and I'm not afraid to say it. I don't want my wife to suffer, and it gives her dignity. I love her more now. I forbid you to go. - He's making you arrogant. - We're not slaves. All that for a pain... Ow! Be careful! Get me some oil, quick! Right. Give me a 50-franc coin. Watch what I do with it. I put the coin in the slot. And a packet of sweets comes out. Do I argue with the mechanism? The rights of man are also the rights of woman. Equality! Don't make me laugh. Nature is not equal. A woman still carries a child for 9 months. - They both want to carry it. - A woman's place is in the home. - The sweets are mine. - Oh, sorry. You can't love children unless you've suffered for them. Then yours must not have hurt you! Come in. Come in! Well, well! What's wrong with you? Sorry to bother you, doctor. We came because... Gilberte and I... have made a mistake. A big mistake? One that gets bigger. If you could help us out... In what way? We can't get married right away. I'm promised a job, but... At the talk you said... ...there's nothing better than giving life to a child. We're happy to be having this one. But I don't want Gilberte to suffer. So until we get married... Could you explain things to her and to me, so that I can help her... Of course I'll help you. He needs kicking out! I'll get up a petition. It's you that needs kicking out. You'll feel my boot in your backside! I'll see you again! Not if I see you first. What do you think of it, Father? I look at my bees. I don't know if they have a soul, but there isn't one flower they don't land on. Some people, I won't say who, can't see wickedness without rolling in it with satisfaction. Isn't the doctor here? He went to help a woodcutter hurt in the mountains. Above Bénévent. Another doctor has called him 3 times. - Know what I heard? - The council is meeting. Yes, we know. They want Dr Bastid to come back. Mr Mayor, you are responsible for your constituents' health. The presence of this miracle doctor is a danger to us. Do you know where he is tonight? In the mountains taking care of a woodcutter. That's his job! He'll contaminate the whole village. He left Paris because of chest problems. Maybe there was an incident. What did his wife die of? How should I know? From his new methods. The midwife has serious reservations. This is all your fault! If he hadn't let him give his talk, there'd be no scandal! You're the one creating a scandal! Are we going to discuss this seriously or not? Because if you want bread... Calm down, gentlemen. Who's next? Mr Gallia. Eliminating pain? If he's so clever, he should start by reducing mine! This is a serious discussion. Mr Rousse. He's ambitious, arrogant and looking for glory. He tried to stop me doing injections, and I was an army nurse! I didn't even charge them much. - You should have paid them. - Me? Why? Because you saw our wives' bottoms! Sorry. Did you want to speak? He intervened personally in a dispute with an ex-employee. Say it: Francine! He was right to defend her. Everyone's happy to bring her down, but forget about helping her up! I'm very pleased she's working for me. I have a proposition signed by several people requesting the return of Dr Bastid. I have a counter-proposition. Francine's delivery is like a match. The Tour de France never comes here. For once we have a major sporting event, and you don't want to see it? I don't know if the doctor's right or wrong. But the betting's on, and Francine's pain is the decider. Now a teenage mother is dictating council policy. There's no need for this. I am reliably informed that the local Medical Council is going to intervene. They may sanction him with a temporary suspension or dismiss him altogether. We can't just stand by. If we don't help him, it'll be like before. It'll be worse than before. We didn't know before. But now... It's as if the sun came out, then disappeared. It's for you. They told me you were here. Do you mind? No... - I wanted to talk to you. - I'm listening. - Here? - Here. Do you want to sit down? Stay, Célina. All this time I've been away. Now I'm back. I can see that. Everyone's talking about you. Thanks to the actions of a certain person. You mean my mother? No, I mean you. I won't say I behaved well. But I've been thinking the last few days. Thinking? You? The soup! Francine... You know I liked you back then. - Those days are over. - With all I'm hearing... It's strange, I feel that way again. Even more so! It's like I'm proud of you. - Hello, Francine. - Hello, doctor. - Sir. - He came to see me. Ladies. They're keeping me company. Good. Sit down. What news? Dr Vanol rang 3 times. A personal matter. Tell me, who is the young man with Francine? The father of her baby. He's got a nerve. Other than the phone calls? You have a letter from the sub-prefecture. Célina, tell the doctor I'll be back. - After you. - No, after you. Where's Francine? She said she'd be back. What's wrong, doctor? There's been a complaint. I'm summoned in 2 days' time. A complaint? My God! You say I've changed. It's true. I'm not the girl who lay down in the lavender with you. I won't say I regret it. I thought you were nice back then. But you're weak. Deep down you want to escape your mother. Now your engagement's off, you turned to me. - But I don't want to marry you. - I'd give the baby a name. A name? He already has one. Mine. - Yes? - It's Dr Vanol. - I didn't hear the phone. - No, he's here. But... Hello, my dear colleague. - Sorry to come by so late. - No. I rang you 3 times and I thought: "Let's go!" I've travelled 50 km through the mountains to see you. That's kind of you. You got it. Yes, I did. Do you remember, a few months ago, you gave a talk. An old lady shook your hand. I remember she said: "Be wary of your colleagues!" She knew what she was saying. That was my wife. She's told me a lot about you. She wanted me to adopt the new methods, but I was close to retirement. "It's not about your age, René," she said, "it's about what's in your heart." - Well, you can tell her... - No. No. She had an attack 2 months ago. And she passed away. But she's still right. I have to learn. In 2 days' time, you'll find me on the other side of the table, as I'm on the Medical Council. I'll be on the other side of the table, but I'll be with you all the same. That's what I wanted to say. Thank you. I'm very touched. It greatly affected my poor wife. You need to make a good impression. So if you could wear a blue suit... The famous blue suit! I even brought you mine, just in case. But now I've seen you... You're too kind, doctor. Yes? The baker's wife came. Francine thinks it's time. - Should she come here? - No, I'm on my way. Thanks. That's all we needed. - You see? You're not in pain. - No. The cervix is dilating. The contractions will become more frequent. - You can't leave her! - I have to. What if something happens? There's still time. I'll call you. Don't worry. Try not to sleep and don't listen to them. - You're the one giving birth. - Yes. - Good luck! - Thank you. Tell them I'm not in pain. Can I speak to you? If you don't take too long. I want you to know something. I don't approve of what they're doing to you. Thank you. If there's one person here I wanted to convince, it's you. I'm not yet convinced. Well, then... At that point, I feel the need to wash, to clean, to scrub. I make the house shine like a new penny. Then I know it'll come the next day. I'm quite the opposite. I'm very active, then suddenly I go all limp and lifeless. I go to bed and that's when it happens. I'm going to have a contraction. It's gone. We have the facts, supported by witnesses. Publicity accorded to a method of which you claim to be the sole exponent, at least in this region. A proposal to educate the public free of charge, I'll admit. Nevertheless, it could constitute touting for custom. Excuse me... Don't forget he was in his own town. Indeed! But Mr Chairman, wasn't a clinic set up at the textile factory? Under your supervision. Do you accept the facts? Do you have anything to say? I have nothing to say. Newspaper articles. We know you didn't write them, but your name is mentioned several times. You must surely know that all of that is banned by our code of medical ethics. Anything to say? No. I'm adding to the file a petition in your favour signed by 50 people, which was brought to us this morning by a young cyclist. A village assumes the right to arbitrate in a medical dispute! We received a request from the Saint-Martin council to re-instate Dr Bastid. That's not our role. Can Mr Bastid give us his view? What you're asking is very delicate. We understand your reluctance. But we're not attacking Dr Laurent here. We're defending principles. Yes indeed. I knew we didn't agree from the start. I told him: "This research is beyond our years." May I ask my eminent colleague at what age Pasteur performed the first inoculation against rabies? 63. I believe Mr Laurent sinned out of excessive goodwill. He doesn't know the countryside. I urge the council to show their indulgence. Thank you, Mr Bastid. Do you wish to say anything? Yes. May I make a phone call? It's urgent. Thank you. Anyone with a degree in medicine should be capable of earning it every day. To whom are you speaking? To my Legion of Honour. - He left you alone? - We're here. Where are you at? Has the pain started? Does it hurt? - He's high. His back's to the left. - Let me breathe. When the pain sets in, you'll have to stop. - Go away! - Be sensible! - Lie down! - Don't touch me! - I must examine you. - It'd be better. Shut up, you. Come near and I'll crown you! We'll see about that. - I think I'd have done it. - So do I. The doctor's on the phone, asking how you are. - I'm coming. - The stairs! - What about it? - That's my daughter. Hasn't it started? You must defend yourself! That's not enough! You have to prove it. You can't give up now. You can't come here, but I can go there. They'll have to let me in. I'll have the baby in front of them! It'll be like I'm your lawyer. You helped me once. Now I'm paying you back. Hello, Saint-Martin? Speak, Saint-Martin! Doctor Ripert? This is Mrs Rébot. She's having contractions. The doctor is at the Medical Council. She won't let me near her. If something goes wrong, I'll feel responsible. What can I do? Stay where you are. I'll come and get her in my car. Well I never! If there's time, I'll go to the clinic... Hello? Hello? Call interrupted. I'll ring back, but it will take a while. Mr Chairman, may I speak now? Dr Bastid asked for your indulgence and I thank him. But I don't want it. I'm proud to say that what I'm doing in Saint-Martin is my best work. I may have violated some of the rules. But at the same time, we're doctors. We're not running a business. The justification for my conduct will be here in 1 hour. - Who? - A young woman. She'll demonstrate by giving birth. That doesn't concern us. I think it's the only thing that does concern you. - What time is it? - Nearly time for lunch. Gentlemen, is scientific curiosity dead? Your brain is being spoken to, and your stomach replies! Agreed. - Let's hope she gets a car. - Francine is changing. No car! And my husband took the van! Who else can we ask? She's gone into town. Go to Mrs Charras's place. Run! It's on blocks! We'll call a horse and carriage if we have to. Come on! You're more familiar with cars than with grammar, yes? The first one to find me a working car will be absolved all punishment. Off you go! Meet me at the baker's! What's wrong with them? My God! Is it noon already? You know I don't have a car. I can't even drive! The petrol tank's been removed. If you'd asked yesterday... Where are the men when we need them? Félicien took the petition. No point asking Mr Rousse. He's waiting for us. What about Catherine Loubet? The car's at the building site. My husband took it. - Is that true? - Yes, it's true. But if you can find another car, I'll drive it. I've got it! He's found one! - Let's go! - Where? To Mrs Carrioux's place! Quick! Mrs Carrioux's place! - It's the cow! - Yes. My husband's converting it to a flatbed. Is the engine OK? It runs perfectly! She's agreed to drive. - I don't have an HGV licence. - Who does? No one! That's very unwise! Today is when you pass your test. I'll turn the starter! Wait! I have to ask my husband's permission! She has to! Look out! This is madness. Dr Ripert is on his way. You'd be laid out like a princess. What do I tell him? Tell him to go to hell. There you go. There's still room. Shall we all go? I'm game! - Where are you going? - To town. - But it's not insured! - It's not insured. I'm not risking it. If anything happens... - All right? - Wait for me. - I can't leave you alone. - Me too! I'm going! What about the men's lunch? - They'll manage. - I'm getting in. Go! It's all down to you. There's a car coming. It's Dr Ripert. I'm in a hurry, let me pass. I'm a doctor. - I didn't want him to see me. - Better safe than sorry. André! - Where are you going? - She's in labour. They're attacking the doctor. I'm going to show them. You'll kill yourselves! Let me drive. - No, leave it to her. - Move the lorry. This is women's business. Move it, hurry up! Come with us. Once upon a time a girl went To town to meet her fiancé To town to meet her fiancé Guess what she found there On the way She saw every tree Greet her with a laugh The springtime smiling The boys Giving their all To try and please her Everyone in their own way I like to travel slowly Along the road where my lover toils Behind him freedom lies I'm going in search of both Behind him freedom lies I'm going in search of both On the way...

I'm going to have a contraction. Put your feet in the stirrups, slowly. She's completely dilated. We'll start to push. Breathe in... And out! Breathe in... Grab the bars! Off you go! Come on! More, more! Keep going! And relax. - All right, doctor? - Well done. Am I doing well? You're doing very well. Now let yourself go. Relax. Thanks. With the next push, the baby will emerge. Breathe in... And out. Breathe in... Push! Come on, come on! Keep going! Extend your elbows. Come on! Don't push with your throat. Come on! Keep going! Come on, come on! Keep going. Gently. Keep going. There's the head. His hair. Relax. - Why were you against it? - You have to see it to believe it. Are you ready? Grab the bars. Off you go. Push gently. Keep going. Push gently. There's his forehead. His eyes. You can see him. Push a little. His nose. His mouth, his chin. The head is out. Gently. - Can you hear him? - Yes. Breathe. There's the first shoulder. I'll put his hand on your leg. The second shoulder. There's his body. It's wonderful. It's a boy. Here he is. It's even better than electricity. You have a son. Are you happy? My son.

It was made with the help of the Métallurgistes maternity unit in Paris, where this method was practised for the first time in France in 1952. Subtitles: ECLAIR
