WHAT HAVE WE HERE? Ronnie: HEY, REVEREND. THANKS, RONNIE. SURE. OH, MY GOODNESS. YOU? THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL. THEY'RE NICE, RIGHT? WELL, IF ANYBODY ELSE HAD SENT THEM, I WOULD SAY THANK YOU. WHEN YOU TOLD ME THE CHOIR NEEDED THEM, I HAD MY ASSISTANT PLACE THE ORDER. REVEREND! I THINK WE HAVE A MIRACLE! THAT BROKEN TRAFFIC LIGHT -- IT'S WORKING AGAIN! GOOD AS NEW! YOU GOT TO COME SEE! DID YOU... DON'T SEE ME LEAVING ANY CARDS. Man: LOOK, IT'S FIXED! [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] THERE'S NO WAY. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. [ CHUCKLES ] Kevin: "DO YOU REALLY THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THAT CHARLOTTE SENT THAT E-MAIL?" Sarah: "NO, SHE'S IN A COMA... BUT HER SPIRIT COULD HAVE." "WHAT'S A SPIRIT? YOU MEAN LIKE A GHOST?" Jenn: "I DON'T KNOW, BUT I SLIPPED ON SOME ICE THIS MORNING, "AND SOMEONE -- OR SOMETHING -- CAUGHT ME JUST IN TIME. BUT WHEN I TURNED AROUND, NO ONE WAS THERE." HEY, MOM! MOM, YOU SHOULD REALLY COME CHECK THIS OUT! [ DOORBELL RINGS ] GWEN. HI. HOW -- HOW ARE YOU? FINE. UH, FINE. I JUST THOUGHT THAT WITH EVERYTHING GOING ON THAT, WELL, YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE TIME TO COOK, SO... OH, THANK YOU. THAT'S -- THAT'S SO THOUGHTFUL OF YOU. UM, COME IN. OH, NO, NO. YES. COME IN, PLEASE. � KIDS? KIDS, COME OUT HERE. YOU REMEMBER GWEN, RIGHT? UH, MAKE HER FEEL AT HOME. I'M GONNA GO GET SOME CIDER FOR EVERYBODY. [ SIGHS ] UM...YOU WANT TO HAVE A SEAT? OH, THANKS. [ SIGHS ] SO...[ CHUCKLES ] HI. I'M SO SORRY ABOUT YOUR AUNT CHARLOTTE. I KNOW THIS SOUNDS REALLY CRAZY, BUT... SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT IT'S HER SPIRIT THAT'S DOING ALL THE THINGS AROUND TOWN. I HEARD THAT. YEAH, UM... DO YOU -- DO YOU BELIEVE IT? I BELIEVE THAT SHE IS A VERY STRONG WOMAN... ...THAT SHE'S DOING EVERYTHING SHE CAN TO GET BACK TO YOU. Pam: WHO WANTS CIDER? OH, GOOD. I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME OVER. THANK YOU. (* Reverend: GOOD MORNING. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ] Charlotte: THESE SHOULD BE DONE. I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND THE POINT OF MAKING COOKIES IF WE CAN'T EAT THEM. BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING THEM. AND THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE. TA-DA! WOW. WELL, DON'T JUST STAND THERE. [ CHUCKLES ] ONE OF THE REASONS MANY OF YOU CAME HERE TODAY WAS TO HEAR MY SERMON, TO HEAR SOMETHING NEW, PERHAPS SOMETHING PROFOUND. NOTHING THAT I COULD SAY TODAY, HOWEVER, COULD BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHAT OUR NEIGHBOR, OUR FRIEND, OUR LOVED ONE, CHARLOTTE HART, HAS ALREADY TOLD US. IN THIS, HER MOST RECENT ARTICLE, CHARLOTTE REMINDED US OF THE IMPORTANCE OF LIVING THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT -- AND NOT JUST UNTIL DECEMBER 25th, BUT EACH AND EVERY DAY. CERTAINLY ACTS OF KINDNESS, FORGIVENESS, AND JOY KNOW NO CALENDAR. SO I BELIEVE THAT THE VERY BEST WAY TO HONOR CHARLOTTE, WHO IS FIGHTING FOR HER LIFE RIGHT NOW... IS TO DEDICATE OURSELVES TO CARRYING OUT HER WISHES. LET US BOW OUR HEADS AND PRAY FOR HER SWIFT AND SPEEDY RECOVERY, AS WELL FOR MR. DANIEL HUNTSLAR. I CAN'T BELIEVE HE MENTIONED ME. THAT'S THE KIND OF PLACE THIS IS. [ BELLS TOLLING ] ALL RIGHT. COOKIES. HEY, MOM, AREN'T -- ARE THESE AUNT CHARLOTTE-- CHARLOTTE'S CHRISTMAS COOKIES. [ CHUCKLES ] DON'T QUESTION IT. THESE COULD ONLY COME FROM HER. RICK: No, it's not looking good. We're in trouble. This woman, she put it into their heads that they'll be run out of town or something. And then people keep coming up to me, asking why Daniel's business card is everywhere. It's crazy. I don't know. The vote's tomorrow, and I can't figure out how we'll get a majority. I don't know what the boss would want me to do. What in the world? "3X." I think I was just told what to do. [ CHUCKLES ] OOH! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? N-NOTHING. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? HEY, UH, YOU KNOW, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE STILL DOING HERE. I MEAN, WHY AREN'T WE WAKING UP YET? HAVE WE DONE EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO? I'M CONFUSED. ARE YOU A LITTLE -- ARE YOU CONFUSED? GWEN, I THINK WE NEED TO TALK. THEY ALWAYS DO. � Gwen: YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE HERE, AND YOU WANT SOME ANSWERS, RIGHT? PRETTY MUCH. WELL, THE TRUTH IS, I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHY, BUT I DO KNOW THAT YOUR FATES ARE INTERTWINED, AND IF YOU DON'T START HELPING EACH OTHER, YOU'LL NEVER COME BACK. YOU SEE? WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT. OKAY, SO WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAM. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT ELSE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. WELL, IT'S REALLY QUITE SIMPLE. FINALLY. YOU MUST LOOK WITHIN. EXCUSE ME? WHY YOU COLLIDED THE OTHER NIGHT, THE REASON. SEE, WHAT WAS GOING ON IN HERE -- THAT'S YOUR UNFINISHED BUSINESS. FIND WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED IN YOURSELVES AND EACH OTHER, AND THEN MAYBE -- MAYBE YOU'LL COME BACK EVEN BETTER THAN BEFORE. YOU KNOW WHAT SHE MEANT BY LOOKING WITHIN, RIGHT? I MEAN, THERE'S -- THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT US THAT WE NEED TO FIX. IS THAT SO? YEAH. AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD HELP ONE ANOTHER TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT IS. YEAH, I-I GOT THAT. HERE'S THE THING. UH... I DON'T HAVE ANY, UH, FLAWS, SO... YOU THINK YOU'RE FLAWLESS? ARE YOU SERIOUS? 100%. OH. YOU KNOW, I-I GOT SOMETHING. I AM A TERRIBLE LIAR. YOUR PROBLEM IS THAT YOU COULD IMPROVE YOUR ABILITY TO LIE? [ CHUCKLES ] WOW. IT MUST BE HARD BEING YOU. IMPOSSIBLE. [ CHUCKLES ] [ SIGHS ] LOOK, WE -- WE ALL CAN'T BE AS RIGHTEOUS AS YOU, CHARLOTTE. WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? OH, PLEASE. ANYONE THAT CAN LEAVE THE JOB THAT YOU HAD TO GO TAKE CARE OF HER BROTHER'S FAMILY, THAT'S... THAT'S PRETTY RIGHTEOUS. WELL, THAT'S, UH, NOT THE WHOLE STORY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, I DIDN'T LEAVE MY JOB. I...WAS ASKED TO LEAVE. I WAS DOING THIS STORY ON A MISSING CHILD, AND I'D BEEN COVERING IT FOR YEARS. AND THEN NOBODY ELSE SEEMED TO CARE ANYMORE. THEY WERE ON TO THE NEXT THING. CASE WENT COLD. AND MY EDITOR INSISTED THAT I DROP IT, SAID THAT I WAS TOO CLOSE TO THE STORY. BUT I JUST KNEW THAT THIS LITTLE GIRL WAS OUT THERE AND SHE WAS STILL ALIVE. S I THINK I-I LOST SIGHT OF MY PURPOSE. THERE WAS NO ARTICLE THAT I COULD EVER WRITE THAT -- THAT COULD HAVE ENOUGH OF AN IMPACT TO TRULY HELP. OR SO I THOUGHT. AND MY EDITOR SAID THAT I SHOULD TAKE SOME TIME OFF. HE -- HE MADE ME... TAKE SOME TIME OFF. AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE? YEAH. MY, UH -- MY BROTHER'S REGIMENT WAS RE-DEPLOYED OVERSEAS, AND I THOUGHT IF I COME HOME, AT LEAST I COULD HELP HIM OUT AND HIS FAMILY, AND... [CHUCKLES] SOMETIMES I DON'T KNOW WHO'S HELPING WHOM. [ CHUCKLES ] � BUT EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON. DOES THAT INCLUDE YOU AND ME? LOOKS THAT WAY. I HAVE BEEN THINKING. OH, NO. [ Chuckling ] OKAY. SORRY. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? I WAS THINKING THAT YOU COULD FORGIVE YOUR FATHER AND STILL KNOW THAT WHAT HE DID WAS WRONG. WHY WOULD I DO THAT? BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS. AND I THINK THAT IT WOULD MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER. YOU THINK THIS IS WHAT I NEED TO FIX? FORGIVING LETS YOU BOTH WIN. NO, I CAN'T DO THAT. ANYTHING ELSE? AS A MATTER OF FACT, THERE IS. HERE WE GO. YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD CHANGE ABOUT YOU, MR. HUNTSLAR? WHAT'S THAT, MISS HART? YOUR SUIT. WH-WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY SUIT? DO YOU KNOW MUCH I PAID FOR THIS? I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH YOU PAID FOR IT. I HAVE BEEN STARING AT IT FOR DAYS. [ CHUCKLES ] FINE. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE ME IN? THESE ARE PRETTY. Daniel: I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS. OH, COME ON. IT CAN'T BE THAT BAD. [ SIGHS ] ALL RIGHT. WHAT DO YOU THINK? [ SIGHS ] IT'S THAT BAD? YOU LOOK GOOD. YEAH? MMM. [ CHUCKLES ] REALLY GOOD. WELL, JUST SO YOU KNOW, WHENEVER I MAKE A TRANSACTION, I LIKE TO SWEETEN THE DEAL. YOU'RE NEXT. ME? YEAH. [ LAUGHS ] NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. OH, YEAH. YOU ARE NEXT. I AM NOT PUTTING ANYTHING ON. OH, YEAH. I'LL PICK IT OUT. ANOTHER PIECE OF BERRY PIE, MAYOR? OH, I SHOULDN'T, BUT, UH [CHUCKLES] IT IS CHRISTMAS. [ BOTH CHUCKLE ] GOOD EVENING, MAYOR. OH. HAVE A MINUTE? SURE, SON. SIT DOWN. UH, ANY NEWS OF MR. HUNTSLAR'S CONDITION? I'M AFRAID NOT. BUT I KNOW HE'D BE THRILLED TO KNOW THAT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH OUR PROPOSAL AND THE VOTE TOMORROW. AH, YES. THE VOTE. I HAVE TO SAY, I DON'T THINK THIS TOWN'S GONNA GO FOR IT, SON. CALL IT BAD KARMA, TIMING. I REALLY CAN'T SAY. BUT...FOLKS DON'T KNOW YOU VERY WELL. AND THEY DO KNOW CHARLOTTE. AND STRANGE AS IT MAY SOUND, PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE FEELING SHE THINKS IT'S A BAD IDEA. THAT'S PRECISELY WHAT I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. [ FORK CLINKS ] YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD, BIG GUY. Charlotte: OH, I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I WAS IN A DRESS. I'M SURE IT'LL COME BACK TO YOU. HERE IT IS. OH, YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL, CHARLOTTE. THANK YOU. I JUST FOUND A FLAW. NO, IN MYSELF. I... I SHOULDN'T BE AFRAID TO LET PEOPLE IN. WHAT'S THE WORST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN? YOU MAKE ME THINK ABOUT THINGS I DON'T THINK ABOUT. AND YOU MAKE ME FEEL THINGS THAT I DON'T USUALLY FEEL. YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T EVEN BE TALKING TO YOU IF WE WEREN'T STUCK IN THIS TOGETHER. IT'S A PRETTY LOUSY SITUATION, HUH? AWFUL.
