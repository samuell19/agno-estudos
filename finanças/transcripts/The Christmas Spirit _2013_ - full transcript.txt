LET'S GO INSIDE, HANG OUT. ...AND FOCUS ON GETTING HOME. YEAH, I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT THIS A GOOD IDEA. GET BACK TO MY LIFE. I MEAN, IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR?

WHAT HAVE WE HERE? Ronnie: HEY, REVEREND. THANKS, RONNIE. SURE. OH, MY GOODNESS. YOU? THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL. THEY'RE NICE, RIGHT? WELL, IF ANYBODY ELSE HAD SENT THEM, I WOULD SAY THANK YOU. WHEN YOU TOLD ME THE CHOIR NEEDED THEM, I HAD MY ASSISTANT PLACE THE ORDER. REVEREND! I THINK WE HAVE A MIRACLE! THAT BROKEN TRAFFIC LIGHT -- IT'S WORKING AGAIN! GOOD AS NEW! YOU GOT TO COME SEE! DID YOU... DON'T SEE ME LEAVING ANY CARDS. Man: LOOK, IT'S FIXED! [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] THERE'S NO WAY. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. [ CHUCKLES ] Kevin: "DO YOU REALLY THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THAT CHARLOTTE SENT THAT E-MAIL?" Sarah: "NO, SHE'S IN A COMA... BUT HER SPIRIT COULD HAVE." "WHAT'S A SPIRIT? YOU MEAN LIKE A GHOST?" Jenn: "I DON'T KNOW, BUT I SLIPPED ON SOME ICE THIS MORNING, "AND SOMEONE -- OR SOMETHING -- CAUGHT ME JUST IN TIME. BUT WHEN I TURNED AROUND, NO ONE WAS THERE." HEY, MOM! MOM, YOU SHOULD REALLY COME CHECK THIS OUT! [ DOORBELL RINGS ] GWEN. HI. HOW -- HOW ARE YOU? FINE. UH, FINE. I JUST THOUGHT THAT WITH EVERYTHING GOING ON THAT, WELL, YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE TIME TO COOK, SO... OH, THANK YOU. THAT'S -- THAT'S SO THOUGHTFUL OF YOU. UM, COME IN. OH, NO, NO. YES. COME IN, PLEASE. ï¿½ KIDS? KIDS, COME OUT HERE. YOU REMEMBER GWEN, RIGHT? UH, MAKE HER FEEL AT HOME. I'M GONNA GO GET SOME CIDER FOR EVERYBODY. [ SIGHS ] UM...YOU WANT TO HAVE A SEAT? OH, THANKS. [ SIGHS ] SO...[ CHUCKLES ] HI. I'M SO SORRY ABOUT YOUR AUNT CHARLOTTE. I KNOW THIS SOUNDS REALLY CRAZY, BUT... SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT IT'S HER SPIRIT THAT'S DOING ALL THE THINGS AROUND TOWN. I HEARD THAT. YEAH, UM... DO YOU -- DO YOU BELIEVE IT? I BELIEVE THAT SHE IS A VERY STRONG WOMAN... ...THAT SHE'S DOING EVERYTHING SHE CAN TO GET BACK TO YOU. Pam: WHO WANTS CIDER? OH, GOOD. I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME OVER. THANK YOU. (* Reverend: GOOD MORNING. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ] Charlotte: THESE SHOULD BE DONE. I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND THE POINT OF MAKING COOKIES IF WE CAN'T EAT THEM. BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING THEM. AND THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE. TA-DA! WOW. WELL, DON'T JUST STAND THERE. [ CHUCKLES ] ONE OF THE REASONS MANY OF YOU CAME HERE TODAY WAS TO HEAR MY SERMON, TO HEAR SOMETHING NEW, PERHAPS SOMETHING PROFOUND. NOTHING THAT I COULD SAY TODAY, HOWEVER, COULD BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHAT OUR NEIGHBOR, OUR FRIEND, OUR LOVED ONE, CHARLOTTE HART, HAS ALREADY TOLD US. IN THIS, HER MOST RECENT ARTICLE, CHARLOTTE REMINDED US OF THE IMPORTANCE OF LIVING THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT -- AND NOT JUST UNTIL DECEMBER 25th, BUT EACH AND EVERY DAY. CERTAINLY ACTS OF KINDNESS, FORGIVENESS, AND JOY KNOW NO CALENDAR. SO I BELIEVE THAT THE VERY BEST WAY TO HONOR CHARLOTTE, WHO IS FIGHTING FOR HER LIFE RIGHT NOW... IS TO DEDICATE OURSELVES TO CARRYING OUT HER WISHES. LET US BOW OUR HEADS AND PRAY FOR HER SWIFT AND SPEEDY RECOVERY, AS WELL FOR MR. DANIEL HUNTSLAR. I CAN'T BELIEVE HE MENTIONED ME. THAT'S THE KIND OF PLACE THIS IS. [ BELLS TOLLING ] ALL RIGHT. COOKIES. HEY, MOM, AREN'T -- ARE THESE AUNT CHARLOTTE-- CHARLOTTE'S CHRISTMAS COOKIES. [ CHUCKLES ] DON'T QUESTION IT. THESE COULD ONLY COME FROM HER. RICK: No, it's not looking good. We're in trouble. This woman, she put it into their heads that they'll be run out of town or something. And then people keep coming up to me, asking why Daniel's business card is everywhere. It's crazy. I don't know. The vote's tomorrow, and I can't figure out how we'll get a majority. I don't know what the boss would want me to do. What in the world? "3X." I think I was just told what to do. [ CHUCKLES ] OOH! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? N-NOTHING. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? HEY, UH, YOU KNOW, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE STILL DOING HERE. I MEAN, WHY AREN'T WE WAKING UP YET? HAVE WE DONE EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO? I'M CONFUSED. ARE YOU A LITTLE -- ARE YOU CONFUSED? GWEN, I THINK WE NEED TO TALK. THEY ALWAYS DO. ï¿½ Gwen: YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE HERE, AND YOU WANT SOME ANSWERS, RIGHT? PRETTY MUCH. WELL, THE TRUTH IS, I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHY, BUT I DO KNOW THAT YOUR FATES ARE INTERTWINED, AND IF YOU DON'T START HELPING EACH OTHER, YOU'LL NEVER COME BACK. YOU SEE? WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT. OKAY, SO WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAM. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT ELSE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. WELL, IT'S REALLY QUITE SIMPLE. FINALLY. YOU MUST LOOK WITHIN. EXCUSE ME? WHY YOU COLLIDED THE OTHER NIGHT, THE REASON. SEE, WHAT WAS GOING ON IN HERE -- THAT'S YOUR UNFINISHED BUSINESS. FIND WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED IN YOURSELVES AND EACH OTHER, AND THEN MAYBE -- MAYBE YOU'LL COME BACK EVEN BETTER THAN BEFORE. YOU KNOW WHAT SHE MEANT BY LOOKING WITHIN, RIGHT? I MEAN, THERE'S -- THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT US THAT WE NEED TO FIX. IS THAT SO? YEAH. AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD HELP ONE ANOTHER TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT IS. YEAH, I-I GOT THAT. HERE'S THE THING. UH... I DON'T HAVE ANY, UH, FLAWS, SO... YOU THINK YOU'RE FLAWLESS? ARE YOU SERIOUS? 100%. OH. YOU KNOW, I-I GOT SOMETHING. I AM A TERRIBLE LIAR. YOUR PROBLEM IS THAT YOU COULD IMPROVE YOUR ABILITY TO LIE? [ CHUCKLES ] WOW. IT MUST BE HARD BEING YOU. IMPOSSIBLE. [ CHUCKLES ] [ SIGHS ] LOOK, WE -- WE ALL CAN'T BE AS RIGHTEOUS AS YOU, CHARLOTTE. WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? OH, PLEASE. ANYONE THAT CAN LEAVE THE JOB THAT YOU HAD TO GO TAKE CARE OF HER BROTHER'S FAMILY, THAT'S... THAT'S PRETTY RIGHTEOUS. WELL, THAT'S, UH, NOT THE WHOLE STORY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, I DIDN'T LEAVE MY JOB. I...WAS ASKED TO LEAVE. I WAS DOING THIS STORY ON A MISSING CHILD, AND I'D BEEN COVERING IT FOR YEARS. AND THEN NOBODY ELSE SEEMED TO CARE ANYMORE. THEY WERE ON TO THE NEXT THING. CASE WENT COLD. AND MY EDITOR INSISTED THAT I DROP IT, SAID THAT I WAS TOO CLOSE TO THE STORY. BUT I JUST KNEW THAT THIS LITTLE GIRL WAS OUT THERE AND SHE WAS STILL ALIVE. S I THINK I-I LOST SIGHT OF MY PURPOSE. THERE WAS NO ARTICLE THAT I COULD EVER WRITE THAT -- THAT COULD HAVE ENOUGH OF AN IMPACT TO TRULY HELP. OR SO I THOUGHT. AND MY EDITOR SAID THAT I SHOULD TAKE SOME TIME OFF. HE -- HE MADE ME... TAKE SOME TIME OFF. AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE? YEAH. MY, UH -- MY BROTHER'S REGIMENT WAS RE-DEPLOYED OVERSEAS, AND I THOUGHT IF I COME HOME, AT LEAST I COULD HELP HIM OUT AND HIS FAMILY, AND... [CHUCKLES] SOMETIMES I DON'T KNOW WHO'S HELPING WHOM. [ CHUCKLES ] ï¿½ BUT EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON. DOES THAT INCLUDE YOU AND ME? LOOKS THAT WAY. I HAVE BEEN THINKING. OH, NO. [ Chuckling ] OKAY. SORRY. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? I WAS THINKING THAT YOU COULD FORGIVE YOUR FATHER AND STILL KNOW THAT WHAT HE DID WAS WRONG. WHY WOULD I DO THAT? BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS. AND I THINK THAT IT WOULD MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER. YOU THINK THIS IS WHAT I NEED TO FIX? FORGIVING LETS YOU BOTH WIN. NO, I CAN'T DO THAT. ANYTHING ELSE? AS A MATTER OF FACT, THERE IS. HERE WE GO. YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD CHANGE ABOUT YOU, MR. HUNTSLAR? WHAT'S THAT, MISS HART? YOUR SUIT. WH-WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY SUIT? DO YOU KNOW MUCH I PAID FOR THIS? I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH YOU PAID FOR IT. I HAVE BEEN STARING AT IT FOR DAYS. [ CHUCKLES ] FINE. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE ME IN? THESE ARE PRETTY. Daniel: I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS. OH, COME ON. IT CAN'T BE THAT BAD. [ SIGHS ] ALL RIGHT. WHAT DO YOU THINK? [ SIGHS ] IT'S THAT BAD? YOU LOOK GOOD. YEAH? MMM. [ CHUCKLES ] REALLY GOOD. WELL, JUST SO YOU KNOW, WHENEVER I MAKE A TRANSACTION, I LIKE TO SWEETEN THE DEAL. YOU'RE NEXT. ME? YEAH. [ LAUGHS ] NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. OH, YEAH. YOU ARE NEXT. I AM NOT PUTTING ANYTHING ON. OH, YEAH. I'LL PICK IT OUT. ANOTHER PIECE OF BERRY PIE, MAYOR? OH, I SHOULDN'T, BUT, UH [CHUCKLES] IT IS CHRISTMAS. [ BOTH CHUCKLE ] GOOD EVENING, MAYOR. OH. HAVE A MINUTE? SURE, SON. SIT DOWN. UH, ANY NEWS OF MR. HUNTSLAR'S CONDITION? I'M AFRAID NOT. BUT I KNOW HE'D BE THRILLED TO KNOW THAT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH OUR PROPOSAL AND THE VOTE TOMORROW. AH, YES. THE VOTE. I HAVE TO SAY, I DON'T THINK THIS TOWN'S GONNA GO FOR IT, SON. CALL IT BAD KARMA, TIMING. I REALLY CAN'T SAY. BUT...FOLKS DON'T KNOW YOU VERY WELL. AND THEY DO KNOW CHARLOTTE. AND STRANGE AS IT MAY SOUND, PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE FEELING SHE THINKS IT'S A BAD IDEA. THAT'S PRECISELY WHAT I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. [ FORK CLINKS ] YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD, BIG GUY. Charlotte: OH, I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I WAS IN A DRESS. I'M SURE IT'LL COME BACK TO YOU. HERE IT IS. OH, YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL, CHARLOTTE. THANK YOU. I JUST FOUND A FLAW. NO, IN MYSELF. I... I SHOULDN'T BE AFRAID TO LET PEOPLE IN. WHAT'S THE WORST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN? YOU MAKE ME THINK ABOUT THINGS I DON'T THINK ABOUT. AND YOU MAKE ME FEEL THINGS THAT I DON'T USUALLY FEEL. YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T EVEN BE TALKING TO YOU IF WE WEREN'T STUCK IN THIS TOGETHER. IT'S A PRETTY LOUSY SITUATION, HUH? AWFUL. BUT I THINK THAT WE BETTER GET GOING IF WE WANT TO FIND OUR WAY BACK INTO OUR BODIES. YEAH. I'M ALL YOURS. âª CHRIST THE SAVIOR IS BORN âª âª CHRIST THE SAVIOR IS BORN âª CAROLERS. WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED? [ CHUCKLES ] âª SILENT NIGHT âª âª HOLY NIGHT âª âª ALL IS CALM âª âª ALL IS BRIGHT âª âª 'ROUND YON VIRGIN MOTHER AND CHILD âª âª HOLY INFANT, SO TENDER AND MILD âª COMING THROUGH! I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE! Carmen: IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? I'LL LET YOU BE THE JUDGE OF THAT, CARMEN. AS YOU KNOW, THERE'S AN IMPORTANT VOTE TOMORROW CONCERNING THE FATE OF LAUREL SPRINGS. AND I KNOW IT WON'T BE AN EASY ONE. Woman: THAT'S FOR SURE. Woman #2: IT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT WITHOUT CHARLOTTE HERE. WHAT SHOULD WE DO? WHATEVER YOUR DECISION MAY BE, IT SEEMS THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT MUST BE SPREADING, BECAUSE THAT DEVELOPMENT COMPANY IS NOW PREPARED TO OFFER THREE TIMES THE WORTH OF EVERYONE'S BUSINESS. OH, MY GOD! REALLY? THAT'S AMAZING! YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY THAT IS? THAT'S FANTASTIC! Daniel: CHARLOTTE. CHARLOTTE, HANG ON A MINUTE. YOU KNOW, I KNEW IT. I KNEW YOU WERE UP TO SOMETHING AT THAT RECEPTION. I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE SO MAD. SELLING IS ONLY GONNA HELP LAUREL SPRINGS. IF WE SELL! GWEN SAID OUR FATES ARE INTERTWINED, AND IF WE DON'T START WORKING TOGETHER, WE'RE NEVER GONNA GET BACK. HELP ME STOP THIS FROM HAPPENING. WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD HELP ME. [ SIGHS ] WHAT IF EVERYTHING IS DIFFERENT BY THE TIME YOU GET BACK HOME? YEAH, I MEAN, WE LOVE LAUREL SPRINGS, AND I DON'T WANT TO MOVE. IT'S GONNA BE OKAY. LAUREL SPRINGS HAS ENDURED AND SURVIVED FOR YEARS. I MEAN, JUST ASK AUNT CHARLOTTE. WHERE IS SHE? WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S WRONG? WE HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, JERRY. CHARLOTTE... CHARLOTTE'S BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT. [ MONITOR BEEPING ] [ SIGHS ] Daniel: AND I BOUGHT THAT FOR MYSELF. HEY. YOU OKAY? I'M JUST... FEELING FAR AWAY. YOU? YEAH. I NOW OFFICIALLY KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE LONELY FOR CHRISTMAS. WHICH IS IRONIC BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS ALONE AT CHRISTMAS. I JUST DIDN'T SEEM TO MIND SO MUCH UNTIL... UNTIL I MET YOU. HELP ME UNDERSTAND. WHY DO YOU THINK THAT LAUREL SPRINGS WILL BE BETTER OFF YOUR WAY? Nurse: SHOOT! LET'S JUST HOPE SHE DOESN'T ACCIDENTALLY KNOCK OVER THE LIFE-SUPPORT SYSTEM. NO WONDER YOU WANT US TO SELL OUR BUSINESSES TO YOU BEFORE CHRISTMAS. THEY'VE REOPENED TALKS TO BUILD A NEW INTERSTATE HIGHWAY, HAVEN'T THEY? AND YOU KNOW SOMEBODY ON THE INSIDE. NO, THOSE ARE JUST SPECULATIVE, CHARLOTTE. NOBODY'S SUPPOSED TO SEE THESE. WHY? BECAUSE ONCE THIS INFORMATION IS ANNOUNCED, THEN -- THEN EVERYONE'S GONNA KNOW WHAT THEIR PROPERTY IS WORTH? YOU ARE TRYING TO DECEIVE EVERYONE! NO, I'M -- I'M TRYING TO DO BUSINESS. REALLY? IS THAT THE WORD THAT YOU USE TO HIDE BEHIND? UH-HUH. SO THAT YOU DON'T RISK FEELING BADLY ABOUT WHAT IT IS THAT YOU DO. NO. IT'S THE WORD THAT I HIDE BEHIND SO I DON'T HAVE TO FEEL ANYTHING. AND IF THAT'S MY PROBLEM, THEN FINE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS, IS THAT YOU GOT ME INTO THIS MESS IN THE FIRST PLACE. YOU SAID YOUR BOSS THINKS YOU GET TOO CLOSE TO THE STORIES THAT YOU COVER? WELL, GUESS WHAT. YOU COULDN'T BE ANY CLOSER TO THIS STORY IF YOU TRIED. IN FACT, EVER SINCE YOU RAN INTO ME, YOU BECAME THE STORY. AND BECAUSE OF THAT, WE MAY NEVER GET BACK TO OUR OWN LIVES. YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT. BUT I WILL NEVER STOP TRYING. AND DON'T WORRY. YOU'RE A TERRIFIC LIAR. [ KEYBOARD CLACKING ] "WE SHOULDN'T SELL." OH, I HOPE THIS WORKS. Mayor: GOOD MORNING. IN A MINUTE, AS YOU WILL SEE, ALL BUSINESS OWNERS WILL GET A VOTE FORM TO FILL OUT, AND AFTER A SHORT DELIBERATION, WE WILL VOTE AT 12:00 NOON WHEN THE CHURCH BELLS RING. NOW, I KNOW I DON'T HAVE TO REMIND YOU THIS IS A VOTE FOR OUR FUTURE, WHATEVER YOUR DECISION WILL BE. SO, WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO ADD SOMETHING BEFORE WE CONTINUE? [ SIGHS ] WISH ME LUCK. [ DOG WHIMPERS ] OKAY. IF NOBODY HAS ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD... YES, I DO! [ PEOPLE MURMURING ] WHAT? WHAT IS THIS? HEY. PASS ME ONE. WHAT DOES IT SAY? WHAT IN THE WORLD? WHERE DID ALL THIS COME FROM? WHAT IS THIS? Morgan: AUNT CHARLOTTE. EVERYBODY, READ THIS! THEY'RE STARTING UP TALKS AGAIN ABOUT A NEW INTERSTATE? WHICH WILL RUN RIGHT BY LAUREL SPRINGS? THIS IS A BIG DEAL IF IT'S TRUE. THAT OR THE FACT THAT CHARLOTTE WROTE THIS? SHE'S DOING IT AGAIN! YOU TRIED TO CHEAT US. CHARLOTTE CARES ABOUT US! YOU DON'T! [ LAUGHS ] OH, I'M SORRY. DO YOU REALLY EXPECT ME OR ANYONE ELSE TO BELIEVE THIS? THIS WOMAN WHO'S IN A COMA HAS SOMEHOW MANAGED TO WRITE A SLANDEROUS ARTICLE ABOUT MY FIRM WITH NO BASIS IN FACT, I MIGHT ADD, OR ANY EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER? I'D THINK ABOUT THAT BEFORE I CAST SUCH AN IMPORTANT DECISION. [ CHURCH BELL TOLLS ] WELL, IT'S TIME. [ SIGHS ] YOU'RE ALL MAKING A MISTAKE. PERHAPS. BUT I'M NOT. DANIEL. YOU REMEMBER LAST NIGHT WHEN I SAID I'M A BUSINESSMAN AND THAT'S WHO I AM? WELL, WHAT I MEANT IS... THAT'S WHO I WAS. I'VE CHANGED BECAUSE OF YOU. I DIDN'T KNOW IT AT FIRST, BUT... IT'S TRUE. EVERYTHING YOU NEED IS ON THIS. [ CHUCKLES ] LOOK! Carmen: THERE'S THE HIGHWAY RIGHT THERE! Man: AND THAT'S AN OFFICIAL HUNTSLAR DOCUMENT. [ PEOPLE MURMURING ] MORGAN, LOOK. SHE'S HERE. SON, I THINK YOU HAVE SOME EXPLAINING TO DO. COME ON, EVERYBODY. LET'S GO. HE'S RIGHT. LET'S GO. THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. BUT NOW I'M GONNA NEED YOUR HELP.

JUST LETTING THE WHOLE WORLD KNOW WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON HERE. âª TILL HE APPEARED AND THE SOUL FELT ITS WORTH âª [ DANIEL EXHALES DEEPLY ] âª A THRILL OF HOPE âª I CAN'T SEEM TO DO MUCH WITH THIS. THERE'S NO BATTERY. CAN YOU DO YOUR THING? IT'S TIME. YOU KNOW, I WISH THAT DAD WAS COMING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS. YEAH. ME, TOO, BUT... WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER WHAT AUNT CHARLOTTE SAID. I MEAN, WHEN DAD GETS HOME, IT WILL BE CHRISTMAS. AND, I MEAN, THAT'S NOT SO BAD. THAT WAY WE'LL BE ABLE TO CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS TWICE, RIGHT? YEAH. SHE ALSO SAID THAT WE CAN'T EVER GIVE UP HOPE, SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. [ CHUCKLES ] Reverend: LET US BOW OUR HEADS IN PRAYER. [ SIGHS ] [ Ringing ] MAN: Hello? Daniel? Is that you? I can see that it's you calling. Hello? DAD? I can't hear you, son. Are you there? YEAH. I don't know if you can hear me, but I just want you to know that I love you. DAD, I... DAD, I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN EVER SEE YOU AGAIN, BUT... Daniel? [ CHUCKLES ] Daniel? ...I WANT YOU TO KNOW I LOVE YOU, TOO. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] I'M REALLY PROUD OF YOU, DANIEL. I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOU. LOOK, THAT THING I SAID LAST NIGHT AT THE HOSPITAL, I-I DIDN'T MEAN -- YES, YOU DID. THAT'S OKAY. I'M A BETTER PERSON FOR HAVING GONE ON THIS JOURNEY WITH YOU. YOU KNOW, THERE'S STILL ONE THING I WAS THINKING OF THAT NIGHT. I REMEMBER. MERRY CHRISTMAS, HART FAMILY. THANK YOU. MERRY CHRISTMAS. THANKS FOR KEEPING AN EYE ON CHARLOTTE. OH, THANK YOU. [ CHUCKLES ] OH, NO, NO, NO. OLIVER, OLIVER. [ WHIMPERS ] OLIVER! [ MORGAN LAUGHS ] YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE IN HERE. [ CHUCKLES ] IT'S OKAY, BOY. WE MISS HER, TOO. MOM. LOOK.

A PRETTY LOUSY SITUATION, HUH? AWFUL. I STILL CAN'T GET DAD ON THE VIDEO CHAT. OH. WELL, I LOOK FORWARD TO TELLING HIM EVERYTHING'S OKAY. Pam: NOTHING WILL MAKE HIM HAPPIER. UH, I'M GONNA CHECK THE TURKEY. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. SO, WE HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU. WHEN YOU GUYS WERE IN THE HOSPITAL, A LOT OF WEIRD THINGS WERE HAPPENING. NO, NO. WHAT HE MEANS IS WONDERFUL THINGS WERE HAPPENING, AND... WERE YOU GUYS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OF IT? YEAH. A LOT OF US THINK IT WAS YOU. IS THAT SO? IT IS CHRISTMAS, AND YOU CAN BELIEVE WHATEVER YOU WANT. [ CHUCKLES ] WELL, I'M GONNA GO GET DAD AGAIN. ME, TOO. WE'LL NEVER TELL. NEVER. OH, CHARLOTTE, I FORGOT TO TURN THE LIGHTS ON ON THE TREE.
