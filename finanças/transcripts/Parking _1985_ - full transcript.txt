To Jean Cocteau who loved the magic words: "Once upon a time.) I love you. Liar. It's true. Listen... I need you so tenderly, Sincerely, honestly Seeing you smile each day ls like Spring for me Living each breath with you Simply happy fight through I need you so, my love. I want only you, Totally, freely Every night dose to you I live again anew Seeing you fall asleep Hearing you say again I want only you, my love. Hove m; you, “away, Joyously, violently if you suddenly left me I'd km or I'd die. A day without you means despair Nothing exists when you 're not there I love only you, I want only you Simply I need you. Quite simply... It's him! There he is! O.K. Now give me the drums... Perfect. - Hi there. - Sorry I'm late. No. The lights aren't ready. We kepi picking up interference on the mikes, then had a short-circuit for an hour. Have you re-worked "the Styx"? Yes, but it's still not right... I've written a new song for Eurydice though. Hello everybody! Let's have a go at "The Styx". The words aren't right... nor's the music. When you're ready... This song is called "The Styx". One day, walking along the Seine, I met Charon, the grim reaper. He'd come to take me over to the other side, across the Styx! I was young without a care. I loved life, all its secrets I behaved in happiness on Earth, like a joyful Vagabond Ignorant of life's distress Love was the only thing I valued. As you drew close, I grew cold My fear was easy to see I sensed trouble ahead Why me? Why me? Why me? With your shroud and your scythe "I'm the grim reaper" you said Though my time hadn't come. Your bark bore me away Threw me oh the other side A drowned man drifting on the tide. From that dismal land of dread Nothing remains in my head But Cerberus at the gate Why...? Why...? Why...? Stop! That's not it... Let's take it again from the 3rd verse. I'm sorry. As you drew close, I grew cold. My fear was easy to see I sensed troubled destiny Why me? Why me? Why me? With your shroud and your scythe "I'm the grim reaper" you said Though my time hadn't come. Your bark bore me away Threw me oh the other side A drowned man drifting on the tide. That's not it. It's not good at all. Shall we take a break? We've been here since dawn. Good idea. Take a rest. I'll keep at it. Can I help? No Calai's, thanks. This song is giving me trouble. Maybe I'll drop it. It's a beautiful song. You like everything I do! Nearly everything... Want something? A beer? Yes, thanks. What's up? Just nerves. We open in two days. Give me 3 francs. I'm off... Where to? Printing error in the program. Someone's name is wrong... See you later. I was young without a care I loved life, all its mysteries I believed in happiness on Earth Like a joyful Vagabond Ignorant of life's distress Love was the only thing I valued As you drew close, I drew cold My fear was easy to see I sensed troubled ahead Why me? Why me? Why me? I've come for you, Orpheus. It's time now. Who are you? Charon. You don't know me. You won't need your guitar. I never leave my guitar. Come on, we're wasting time. Come on! Get in! I don't want to. Don't argue. It's pointless. Repeat: I must go with you. I must go with you. I obey your orders. I obey your orders. Good. Get in! Why are they all wet? A shipwreck. And those? Been to war. Excuse me... Come back! What about my rehearsal...? This way, please. Hey, you! Your papers. Orpheus. You're a guitarist? A singer. I write songs. I like songs myself. The golden calf is standing still... Something seems to be wrong. ENTRY DATA ERROR SEE WITH HADES You're not booked for today, sir. Mr. Orpheus, please. Yes, Madam. Mr' Hades is waiting. Right, Madam. Take this gentleman to Mr. Hades. This way, please. Mr. Orpheus... a very talented pop singer. Married, no children. Rumor has it you are very well known... and liked. I think so, yes. That gives you pleasure? I like singing. It makes people happy. That makes me happy. But I don't like the song I'm doing. it's giving me trouble. Do you see...? We are not here to talk about your song. Or happiness... Why am I here? He clearly knows nothing. Nobody told you? Told me what? You didn't tell him? That's hardly my job. Well, I'm afraid there's been a mistake. It's unfortunate... like all mistakes. We have your departure date, but there's nothing about your entry. The figures don't match. I've always had trouble with figures. According to our files, your death is not programmed yet. Look at that! Even his Social Security number doesn't correspond! It's unbelievable! How did we get in such a mess? It's the first time. We'll have to get rid of him! Get rid of me? You have accidentally discovered... "The Great Secret". As I said, it was a mistake, which must be fixed as soon as possible. I'm sending you back. Obviously, you must never speak to anybody... Nobody! about what you've seen or heard. You'll also sign our form. Claude, give him a form. Don't waste your time reading, it's a basic form. Just sign here. For now, you are alive, Orpheus. Vanish! These poor humans will never understand anything. You didn't have to... He wasn't in order. Nor are we. I distrust artists: they think, they talk, they dream, and they say anything they like. Since when do you care what people say? I don't. But it is highly disagreeable to hear unpleasant things about yourself. Follow this man and watch him closely. On what pretext? You'll think of something. You know him. Talk to him... There's no doubt about it... You don't seem very fond of me these days! - What happened? - I saw a shower of sparks, and he collapsed. How do you feel? I don't really know. - Better call a doctor. - I agree. - No, I just fainted? - You really ought to... No, I feel fine now. Completely O.K. I had a strange dream... l'll tell you later. Certainly not! The rehearsal's over for today. I have to finish the song. No, I'm driving you home. You can hardly stand up. Yes... I think you're right. I don't feel very well. It's useless now. You've got dozens... So? In my dream... I thought I was dead. I was in Hell, or what I thought was Hell. It's that song... There was an amazing guy called Hades and a very beautiful woman called Claude. They'd condemned me to live, when I woke up... Dreams always sound so stupid... Yes, it's true. Always. Don't say anything to Eurydice. - About? -About me fainting. She'd worry. Good evening, Clément. A woman called on the private line. Several limes, in fact. She didn't leave her name, or her number. She'll call back... You're late, my love. It's to make you anxious to see me. I like that. What is it? It represents our love. You and me. But it's not finished. That's logical. Our lover's not finished either. Don't say that. It might jinx us. I got frightened today. I was working on this when the man's head fell to the ground. I saw you dead, my love. It was about 5 o'clock. It gave me such a shock... I felt something had happened to you. Where were you at 5? 5 o'clock? Rehearsing. Listen, I don't want to die at all. The proof is I'm starving hungry. When I came back, he was lying there unconscious. I had quite a fright. You called a doctor? He didn't want to. Insisted he felt fine. Here he comes. Don't say a word. He doesn't want Eurydice to know. Dinner's ready! - Orpheus is dying of hunger. - Us too! What happened? Hurt yourself? I got stung by a bee. It's nothing. They still move. Coming? He told me a grim story about death and Hell which I didn't like one bit. He's just tired. It's true. I guess I take everything too seriously. Good evening, Clément. Good evening, Lucienne. Smells good... ls it pigeon? - Duck: "Canard Nantais". - Can I taste? - Careful, it's hot. - You greedy thing. It's delicious! - Are we ready to eat? - 5 minutes. No, I've already done that. What else? A Japanese tour next Spring... O.K.? Yes. - A kids' benefit on the 27th. - Yes. A video-clip project you should read. Nothing else. Have you seen Eurydice's ideas for the album? Not yet. He just got here. I've hardly seen him myself. The pleasure I get looking at you my love is quite unique. It's something I never get tired of. Don't you find my poet beautiful? We all love him. Even when he's temperamental. Isn't that so? He's not any more, now he's happy, loved and in love. It's true, I am happy... Thanks to you. Let's drink... to love. Anyone listened to the messages? No. Some woman called about 15 times. She left no name or number. My sister and I are in love with you... It's true... We'd like to... You know what... Asshole. I hate your stupid fucking songs. You make me sick... Nice guy. I run the A.S.S., and we'd like to have you at our New Year's Eve Ball. I'll call again tomorrow... Thank you. Mr. Orpheus, Claude Persephone speaking. It's urgent we meet. I have quite an exceptional offer to make you. Eurydice, come and listen. Is this the woman who called? Do you recognize her voice? I run the A.S.S, and we'd like to have you at our New Year's Eve Bah. I'll again tomorrow... Thank you. It's not the same. It was the one after, but it's gone. You erased it. No, I just listened to it. - What is it? - Nothing. I just don't understand... Come see Eurydice's projects. What do you think of them? I like this one. Not that, or that... this one I like a lot. Then we'll use it. I'll take it in tomorrow. - No regrets? - No regrets! It's ready. Let's have dinner then. - Somethings worrying you. - No... I'll tell you about it, but not now. What are you plotting now? Dinner's getting cold! You haven't mentioned the rehearsal. There wasn't anything to say. Except that Orpheus is dropping the Styx song. Good idea. I never liked it. Pity, I think it's beautiful. It weighs down the whole first half. Things don't take off. - Don't you agree, Calais ? - No! What don't you like about it? It's a song which doesn't have anything to say. It's about death. Well, I don't care for death. Yes, Ma'am, hold on... It's that woman... Pass me the phone. Seen the time? The nerve! I'll speak to her. It's me again, Claude Persephone. I apologize, it's rather late... You don't know me, but as I said in my message, it's urgent we meet. Meet me... Why? It's very important. I can 't explain over the phone. Meet me tomorrow at 5 at the "Café du Théatre". I know you're free. Tomorrow at 5. Pm counting on you“... Who are you? Tomorrow at 5! Who was it, my love? That woman. What about her? What did she want? Nothing. She wants to see me. Between you two my heart Between you two my heart swings My heart swings From you to you my Hie springs My life springs Between joy and sorrow Between fig and grape Between rhyme and reason Between your tune And my song Between you two my heart Between you two what pleasure What measure From you to you my heart From you to you my heart staggers My heart staggers Between the tall blond guy and the brunette Between the sun and moon Between black, between white Between morning and night Like a pierrot my heart Like a pierrot from one to the other From one to the other From the other to one my heart From the other to one my heart swings Pm just lucky You my virgin come from afar You my joy, my Gemini star You my two love children at play You two are my night and my day How to choose? Why choose? - Want to hear it? - How was it? - Alright. - What do you mean "alright"? I'm not crazy about it. What do you mean? I say what I think. It's not great. That's the best one yet! Yesterday Aristée gave me trouble about "The Styx". Today it's you. What are you all trying to do? Drive me mad? Calm down. It's only my opinion. That's what worries me. O.K., O.K. Everything you do is terrific. Want to hear it? Hang on... You really think the song is no good? I didn't say it was no good. I said I didn't like it. But that's what I dread the most. It's exactly what I don't want to hear. I want to please people, you understand? Women, men, dogs, cacti, stones... That's what kills me. - Please that woman, you mean. - What...? Who is she? What's this car park business? You wouldn't believe me... it's all too weird. Don't go! Why do you say that? Because I smell trouble. Eurydice does loo. Eurydice is jealous. And so are you. It's true, I'm jealous. I'm jealous... and it's new. A coffee... No, not coffee... Yes, coffee... With milk, Mr. Orpheus? No. Would you mind giving me an autograph? It's for my son. He has all your records, and goes to all you shows. Excuse me, I was on the phone. But... we know each other. No, I don't think so. I know you, yes. Who doesn't? But you couldn't know me. I swear, we've already met. In another life perhaps... or in a dream. A glass of iced water. Shall we sit down? I haven't been "up to Paris", as they say, for ages. I'm here for a publishing company I've been working for... for a long time. We mainly handle classical composers, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms... Your music interests us, and we thought we might be able to take care of it. We would of course sign a contract. What do you think? I'm very touched by your offer, but I don't need anybody. I have all the staff I need. I've an agent, two lawyers, an accountant, a manager, three offices, a secretary, two fan clubs... and more. I could make you, I don't know immensely famous... immortal even. You're kidding. My songs will die with me. My talent is for my contemporaries not posterity. I wanted to offer you a deal. I won't insist. Well, if you change your mind call me. The firm is very interested in you... very... There's no number, or address. Marie-Paule and Virginie are twins. They're perfect... physically, as you can see? Creatures of God or the Devil, They're new club members, but they'd come pose for pleasure. They're mad about you. That's really very kind. Just come and see us at the club more often. We have all kinds of interesting events, symposiums, seminars, round table conferences, etc. I work from morning till night. And Orpheus takes up the rest. Night to morning, I understand. Since you mention him, there is a small problem... I'm speaking not as a friend, but as the Club founder. Actually, we are very annoyed. God knows none of us can complain about you... In fact, we've even brought you a present, a souvenir of our Club nights... Thanks Dominique, but those days are over. For me, in any case. What are you getting at? It's simple. The Club had all decided lo go to Orpheus' opening night. We needed a certain number of tickets. Orpheus promised me personally. Well, yesterday some idiot told me it was full. I've never been so insulted! This faux pas could well turn against him. Our members could cause a scandal. We wouldn't want that. It's misunderstanding. I'll take care of it myself. You'll have your tickets tomorrow, I promise. Thanks, darling. Let's go. See you soon. We're counting on you. So you saw her then? Do you believe in death? We all die sometime. In the hereafter? Unknown forces manipulating us? Mysteries we think we understand... You're shaking! Remember when I fainted I said I'd had a dream... I told you I was taken away into another world where I met a very beautiful woman... I wasn't dreaming. I've just seen her again. I've discovered another world! Either you're still dreaming, or you're kidding me. It all seems too absurd? I love your shaggy dog stories, but wouldn't you rather hear the mix? Not now. After dinner. As you like. Clément was looking for you. He's in the kitchen. You wanted to see me? It's about the poplars that came down. Need cutting up, else they'll rot. They're in the way. Do it when you like. I'll make an apple-charlotte for the opening... Go set the table, you. It's late. What is it? You know I hate that kind of thing. That's the limit! I come to you and you shrink away in disgust. You think that's nice! Do you realize, or not? Wait, I don't get it. What? What don't you get? This scene is ridiculous. You start aggressing me... Me aggressing you? It's you that's ridiculous, my poor man! Have you gone mad? Is that what's making you edgy, my poor girl? I forbid you to talk to me like that! I'm not your "poor girl", pour fool! You wear me out! I wear you out? I can always leave if I'm disturbing you... I wear you out! Anybody'd think you lived with some... old bat. You are the one being difficult. You've become unbearable! Everybody's complaining. Who's "everybody"? Everybody. Your friends, others... Even Dominique Daniel, who came by. She's furious. You forgot to reserve the club's tickets. You know that's not my fault. Aristée takes care of that! She brought you this? Yes. So what? Not that again? Give it back! What do you really want? Give it back! Want to end up like Maria, Steve, Michael...? I'll end up how I like. Give it back! You' re hurting me. Let me go. I don't give a shit. Fighting now are we? Your hurt me. You brute! Monster, egoist, psycho... You're sick! I hate you! Pain in the ass, hysterical junkie... Yet you think you control everything! Just forget it! Hear the way my poet talks to me? Isn't poetry wonderful? I'm ashamed. I do my utmost to make this madhouse function correctly... I'm so ashamed! Tell her to shut up, or I'll... Shame on you... and on me! I'm sick of all this. Take your ring! Here's your ring. See what I care! - What's happening? - Madness. Calm her down. I can't take any more. Leave me alone. I'm loosing it. I've had enough. Don't cry. Calm down. It's over... finished. I never want to see him or hear his name again. I want nothing else to do with him. Nothing's over... You can see he doesn't love me any more. Everything I do annoys him. I irritate him, wear him out... You don't believe a word of it. It's just another fight. It's not your fault. He's nervous. There's something else. He doesn't like the show. He doesn't like himself. He doesn't like anybody right now. I know there's something else. Maybe he's met another woman. He no longer gives a damn about me, himself, or you. I'm tired, and I think I'm going to leave. Go somewhere a long way away. What are you looking for? My ring. Why? If you want a divorce? I never said I wanted a divorce. I said I hated him, and I wanted to go away. When you see him, wish him good luck for the opening, because I won't be going. Like a pierrot my heart Like a pierrot from one to the other From one to the other From the other to one my heart From the other to one my heart swings I'm just lucky. You my virgin come from afar You my joy, my Gemini star You my two love children at play You two are my night and my day How to choose? Why choose? Eurydice's still not here? Go back to the dressing room. Hurry. In Paris at leisure They search for pleasure From New York to Tokyo London to Toronto...

She's so obstinate! Did you call again? She won't answer. They want you back... - Go well? - You bet. 2nd set works much better. Is the 1st too long? Not for me. With the audience, it was tremendous. They loved it. It was great! I'll come again... What is it? - They want autographs. - Let him take his shower. He's not ready. O.K. Let me through, please. Orpheus will be at "The Renaissance" in a hour's time. It was in the newspapers. Don't push... An enormous success... amazing, magnificent. It's all booked up. You could fill the place for 6 months. Thanks a lot! You don't like success anymore? Yes, very much. But I told you, I don't like this show. What's wrong with it? Ii lacks power... imagination... spontaneity... I don't know... I'd like to give more... share more... There was no warmth tonight. No warmth! Didn't you see how they greeted you? All the reviews will be good. And you don't know what it's like outside! They'll break everything like last time... Remember at the racetrack? Police everywhere... Did you speak to Eurydice? She won't answer. And Clement and Lucienne can't be there yet. They've just left. The line must be out of order. It's busy? No. Try again. We'd better go. Everybody is waiting at "The Renaissance". I don't want to go. You can't do that. We announced it everywhere? Alright. O.K. This way. The bikes's in the yard. Call again. Tell her to meet us at "The Renaissance". Thank you. Thank you all for coming. Let's drink to your success! Long life and happiness!

I'll go. Something happened. It's serious. - It's dreadful. - Where is she? Upstairs. We didn't touch anything. Eurydice, my love... It's not true... I can't believe it... Forgive me. I'm right by you... I'm here... I love you... Speak to me... Give me that. Nobody must know. Not for anything. She killed herself because of me. Il was my fault. I killed her! No, it was an accident. You loved her. It's true I loved her. More than anything. I'll never be able to live without her... Will this lake long? It's a mere formality. I'm rather bored and I'm cold. Excuse me... But... what do I do? Nothing, wait here. Miss...! No, Mrs. You're right Mrs... Accident? An accident? It's been changed from suicide. Yes, accident. I don't like the idea of suicide. You can put "escape" if you like. Escape...? Impossible. I can't erase it now. It's too late. Off you go. This way. Your papers, please. I'm looking at her now. Intently. It's like she's moving... breathing... She's going to move...! I'm going mad. I can't bear this pain. I've lost her, Calais. For ever. Not for ever? That's true. I'll go get her. I know the way. I didn't mean that. Shake yourself out of it. You've got to go on living. Do you hear me? I'll never have the strength. That's not you talking. You've got to get to work. Write... You've got to sing again. For yourself, and for us, who need you. Do you hear? Sing your pain like you sang your joy. I'm here to help. I love you. I love you too, Calais. Like I love life. You are my life. No woman will ever replace Eurydice. No man will ever replace you. It's all over the papers. "Mysterious death: accident or suicide..." "Singer's wife's brutal death", "Singer silent..." "Orpheus: all concerts canceled." "Husband-wife quarrel: intimate friend D. Daniel tells all." I don't care what they say. I don't care it they know the truth. Eurydice's dead, and I want to be left alone. Put the phone off the hook! Driving us crazy! I'll shut the ringer. Don't touch anything. It could be her calling. Who do you mean "her"? You know, the mysterious woman... It's the TV They want details. I'll take it. You think she was joking? I don't believe anything. The Hades Company doesn't exist. I've checked. She's just some mythomaniac... One more wacky fan... Your considerable imagination made up the rest. She exists. The car exists! Charon too. I'm not mad! The café... What café? I met her at the Café du Théatre. She must know someone there? The landlord or bartender... I should have thought of that before. - Is the bartender here? - We don't have one. The guy who was here last week... No guys here. It's not that kind of place. He's coming to. - My head...! - Keep calm... It's not serious. You are lucky. Lucky...? Ah yes, the wall... A stupid, inexplicable accident. Apparently you drove clean into a wall. You must have felt faint and lost control. That's not it, I drove into the wall on purpose. I wanted to get to the other side. You wouldn't understand... This one's good. Let me see. Not bad. It's him. Look. That's Charon. See, I wasn't dreaming. But where is he? Where's that woman? Forget it. It's like some nightmare. Pull yourself together. He's right. Forget it. You must accept Eurydice is dead. I can't go on. I'm tired out. I've nothing left to say. I'm worn out, washed up, finished. My life makes no sense. Did you hear that? No guts... coward. Drop everything then, and us with it. They have short memories in this business. There are plenty of talented kids just waiting. Nothing they'd like more. Make room for the young! - Said your piece? - Not yet. I'd just like to add... Shut up. You're going too far. It's that woman from the Hades Company... Hello... Yes, it's me! I'm afraid I was out of town... I know what you ire going through. loan help. Are you ready? Ready for what? To sign. I can't talk over the phone. I need to see you. The Montmartre Cemetery in an hour. I've drawn up a new contract which annuls the other. Sign at the bottom. If l do, will you grant me a favour? I'm listening. I want to see Eurydice again. It's impossible. I don't believe you. It's not within my power. You can do anything! I'm afraid not. Who are you? Who do you work for? There's no Hades Company. I've checked. Hades is my uncle. I work for him. I made the mistake of marrying him. Satisfied? Now will you sign? Grant me this favour! You are intolerable. You'll see Eurydice again. Come. This is your pass. It mentions your request. Take Mr. Orpheus to Hades. This really is too much. Favors... privileges, partiality, preferential treatments... Why not a Good Deed while you're at it? And all that with proper forms... It doesn't bother you? I don't know whether... I do the talking here! I know you're a special case. - You've already been here... - I didn't ask to come. That's no excuse. Today you're back with this authorization. Legal, it's true, but I don't like it. It looks like my niece has gone mad. Where is she? You ought to know. You disciplined her yourself. ii wasn't nice. This is hardly the time for that! There you are. Now, what about this contract? Since when do you hand out favors like this? You told me to watch out for him. You're not going to make a fuss? We'll discuss it later! What is signed is signed. I won't go back on that. Have Eurydice come in, Charon. Orpheus, my love! I find this kind of display disgusting. You're free, Orpheus. We'll let you have her back on one condition: you must not look at her until you reach daylight. One look at Eurydice and you'll lose her for ever. That's ridiculous. Be quiet. Do as I say! Come, my love. Let's go quickly. You're perverse. It is merely a punishment. It's absurd and cruel. They'll never make it. Have you no compassion? We have to go on. Let's stop. Be brave. We're nearly there. I can't breath. I feel terrible. I need you. I want you to hold me tight. Make an effort, please. I need to look into your eyes. I want to touch you. I want to make love with you. If I look at you, I lose you. I'll blindfold you. We can love without looking. Some people who love each other don't even see each other any more. Now you're all mine. I can look at you all I want. You are so beautiful, Orpheus. I do love you so. My love, my sweet... My life... You're right. It won't be long. Curiosity will be the death of them. Love is well worth dying for. I've known you more cruel. Your trips to the land of the living do you no good. What are you doing? I can't walk with this over my eyes. Is it far? We're nearly there. See the light? At the end of the tunnel there's life! I'm tired. I can't go on. One last effort and we'll be free. Look at the light... Watch out, he's crazy! Eurydice Where are you? Eurydice Can you hear me? Pm calling you You're no longer there Eurydice Eurydice Where are you? Eurydice What are you doing? Eurydice Can you hear me? I'm looking for you But you're silent Eurydice, my love Where are you? Ever since I walk and breathe Eat and look around Sing and get bored But PH find you again Because there's only one step From my Hie to your death Eurydice Where are you? I want to see you again I'm looking for you I'm calling you Without you Pm nothing Can you hear me? Eurydice, my love Where are you? How was I? Terrific! That's all Magnificent. Knock out. Pure genius. Thank you. That's what I like to hear. What's new? It's sold out. I told you we needed a bigger place. I've got trouble on every side. We can't do a show for the Bacchantes. They're furious. - They always complain. - They sent a threatening letter. Let's see it. I left it at the office. It can't be serious. I'll speak to Dominique. I'll fix it. Shall we listen to it?
