There is a problem. It is too small. Sir, we took the deceased's measurements. -Whose? -Your brother's. Jean. Joseph... I know my brother. He is my height. It is too small. -What are you doing? -Dad, please. You see? It is too small. -We took the deceased's measurements. -My brother's. -Please. -Come on, ma'am. Come, let's go back up. Come, Dad. Please. Don't tell Joachim I did that. ...of the discourse, tied from the large thread, affects the constitution of the subject, that interests psychiatry. Well? A ghost. Well... Harmony indeed plays constantly on the meaning of "S." "S" as the signifier or "S" as the subject. Are you kidding, Joachim? Who do you think you are? You are meant to have been writing a thesis in psychiatry for two years. -You don't have a plan, I guess? -No. -Or the title? -No. All the students who have just left. They write, they work, they don't get extensions. Do you know why? Because their dad is not a friend of their thesis supervisor. How petty. I hate people who make you feel guilty. And I hate little jerks! I am asking you a question. You were my most enthusiastic student. Where did he go? -What are you doing here? -Are you getting in? No, I feel like walking. Andre told me he was seeing you today about your thesis? -What are you doing here, Ivan? -I didn't go to class. Joachim, did it go OK with Andre? -Yeah, I gave him a first draft. -That is good, right? See you at home. Your uncle was really metastasized. Thanks a lot. Yes, he was a good guy. Are you OK, Iris? Oh, I am sad... I am your cousin, Joachim. You don't do that to your cousin. -What is wrong? -What, "What is wrong"? Have you not heard of incest? Yeah, but... I think it is only forbidden with close members. Like with your sister. I have no sister. That is lucky. -Can I speak to you? -Of course. Excuse me. Listen, some colleagues from Jean's faculty came to see me, because they want to organize a symposium in his honor. I need your help. I almost... fainted at the funeral, I am tired. But... I told them you would be able to help them. No, I can't. I have to finish my novel. -What? -I have to finish my novel. When I find the date for my... I have left my practice, I got a substitute. -What? -I haven't told the kids. What do you tell them when you leave in the morning? I tell them I am leaving, but I don't. I go to a writing course, to do writing school, at a local organization. You are taking writing classes and no one knows about it? No. Why don't you say anything? I tried, then I got scared, I don't know. Yes, I... No, but you are a distant cousin, you are not even really a cousin. You are Jean's son's daughter. That is as first cousin as you can get. Freud says nothing about that. Let's go for a drink, one day. How about it? -Can I speak to you, man. -Wait, wait. OK, Iris? So, how are you, Ivan? So? You don't want to? Absolutely not. -What? What is it? -Dad... -What? -I don't know how to say it, he is... -Is he depressed? -He wants to become a writer. What you are saying, are you drunk or what? No, I only had one drink. What, you had one drink? Man, chill, you are chatting up our cousin... No, I am not chatting up our cousin... Anyway. What is all this about? He stopped the practice, he is no longer a doctor. OK, he is raving mad. How are you managing? -What? -To keep it together. I do as I have always done. Ever since I met him, I have been alive. Being crazy about him. I am scared for Dad. Next time, we buy plastic cups. For my funeral? Stop Dad, you are not funny. Don't listen. I was joking. Kids, I have something to tell you. I have given up my practice. When Jean became ill, two years ago, I solely dedicated myself to writing. Next week, a bookshop has asked me to read some extracts. -That is very good, Dad. -Yes, it is good. It is a great opportunity. I am tired, I am going to bed. You go to bed too. When we go to bed, it will never be November 23rd 2018 again. And? That is I want to explain to Melissa. Can you tell her? You tell her. I feel like she doesn't want to speak to me anymore. Tell her what, then? Well, the only way for it... What is "it"? Time passing by ineluctably. -"Ineluctably." -Towards death. Anyway, the only way is for us to go out together. -You want to go out with Melissa? -More than anything. Do you know she is seeing a guy? It is really serious. But I am a tiger. ...which means it is written with an infinite number of decimals, without any logical order. The first ones are 3,14, 159, 265. Pi occupies a particular spot in the mathematical world and it has been on the mind of mathematicians since Antiquity. -Rose! Have you told her? -The Greeks essentially needed geometry to calculate the surface of the earth and in architecture, to work out the proportion and size of buildings. Initially, they used the number Pi for practical and daily needs. SHE DOESN'T CARE It is funny that the more and more detailed analysis of Pi gave rise to, almost like a game, analytical formula that were more and more effective, from Antiquity to the Renaissance. In the third century B.C., Archimedes of Syracuse established that the surface relation of a circle... MELISSA, YOU HAVE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL NECK EVER ...to its squared radius is equal to the relation of its perimeter to its diameter. AND WHEN I SEE IT, MY WHOLE BODY STARTS TO HOLLER ...he knows how to calculate the perimeter very accurately. -For Melissa. -He applies this method by using, polygons with 96 sides and obtains an approximate value of the circumference... -Melissa! -...to work out Pi. The irrationality of Pi is even more surprising than the square root of two, since the square root of two is the solution of the equation: XÂ² = 2. In other words: what number should be multiplied by itself to get 2. "My fear is that I am never taken seriously." No, no, no. "It is that no one ever misses me." CIVIL AVIATION Move. I will be the greatest psychoanalyst in the world. I will be the greatest psychoanalyst in the world. I will be the greatest psychoanalyst in the world. I will be the greatest psychoanalyst in the world. "There is nothing shocking, believe me, "about a young man chasing girls and liquor. "No is flagitium, "no is..." Ivan? -Are you OK? You look worried? -No, nothing, I am tired. -Go and lie down, if you want. -No, it is fine. Lie down, translation is tiring, it is like a combat sport. Lie down. -You can speak to me, if you want. -In Latin? No, in French, to start with, it is better, I think. I dream in Latin, sometimes. I even had a sexual dream. A dream with a girl where we spoke in Latin. -With Melissa? -How do you know? Well, you told me about her last time. -Is she the one worrying you? -Can I make a confession? I called Suzanne yesterday. -Suzanne? -My brother's boyfriend. You mustn't do that, Ivan. They are adults. You see, before, he was strong. A bit like... Yes, like Putin. -Like Putin? -Yes, the Russian, you know? What are you saying? Since they split up, I don't know, I find him... not pathetic, but... He is a bit tired. I wanted to make sure they couldn't get back together. What did she tell you? That she didn't want to hear about him anymore. But I want to help my dad too. No, it is very kind of you, but it is not up to you... You see what my dad is like. Ever since Jean died... he has been weird. I feel something will happen to him. -I hope it will be busy. -Of course it will be busy. I invited friends from school. Did you tell the janitor's daughter, Melissa, to come too? I invited my Latin tutor. Are you taking extra Latin classes? Are you some kind masochist? I am going to sit the Latin entrance exam. -Aged nine? -Thirteen. Aged 13, you want to be a footballer or a cosmonaut, not a Latinist. Do you like Ovid that much? I prefer Livy. Anyway, no Melissa, then? My teacher told me she knew you. -She must be wrong. -She is Laura's best friend. -Laura? -Allan's friend. Your Latin tutor is friends with Laura, Allan's friend? Yeah. -Esther, right? -Yeah. Yeah, I think I know who she is. -What did she say about me? -She hasn't talked about you. She is tactful. She just asked me if I was your brother. -What did you say? -What do you think? Yeah, it is true. Don't worry, it will be busy. And dad is very stylish. It is going to be OK. -What is up, dude? -Are you good? -Are you OK, little dude? -I am going in. Have you seen my dad? He is inside, I think the bookseller wants to cancel. -Why? -I don't know. -It is nice of you to come. -Laura is here with a friend. Oh yeah, that is nice. Her friend likes you, apparently. Do you realize Laura is giving birth in a month? -Do you have a cigarette? -Here. -In a month. -Wait, what did you say? -I am going to be a dad in... -No, just before, about Esther. Apparently she likes you. I hope it will be busy. Hey, are you Ivan's friends? He is inside. Yeah, well... -He helps us in French. -What? He helps us in French and we hang out with him. -I am his older brother, you jerk. -He is over there, right? Shall we go? Let me introduce you to Joachim. My son. -Ah, the eldest? -The eldest. -The one doing his thesis. -Oh yes. Of course. Well... Sorry, Esther. Don't worry, I am a Latin teacher, I am used to empty rooms. It is awful, I even asked friends to come. Don't worry about them. Well no, they are friends. -Hello, by the way. -Hello. Shall we go and sit with Allan and Laura? Well, Ivan, you can go with your friends. OK. We are already 20 minutes late. Come on, let's go. Well... Hello. Thank you for being here. As you know or maybe you don't know, my brother has died. He became ill two years ago and that is when I realized that it was impossible for me to deny my unsociable desire of creation. So, of course, it is a bit disorderly. It is important for a writer, I prefer to keep little secrets. "Ivan. "My little Ivan. "His eyes latched on to mine, his tiny hand grasping the table "that he is about to let go to jump into the world. "They tell me: 'Dad, I am a bit scared.' "And my eyes reply: 'Go, my son.'" This extract... is far more rooted in the problem of the writer and... "For the first time, I am before this white sheet, 80 grams. "I bought this at the stationer's as if I was committing a crime "and here I am before this whiteness "attracting me like the cover of snow from my childhood. "I shiver at the idea of leaving my mark. "I wanted to put an end to this inheritance of pain "by laughing more than the others. "It is the promise I made to the child that I was. "The sum of all the women in my life, "a phallus with an angel's smile." Let me you read another one. "I am only here to test my strength, "a sort of clumsy Tower of Pisa." A last one, maybe. This is more intimate. More cavalier, I would say. "My heart beats like mad. "And my liquid soul spills over my first lover's large breasts. "She smiles at me. I set this moment in eternity." Well... Well, that is it. Ivan! -Fuck you, losers! -Hey, stop! Stop! Stop! -What is wrong with you? -You, loser! Do you want me to have a heart attack? I don't care! Wait, dammit! -Do you want my heart to stop? -I don't care! -What is your problem? -I have had enough of Dad and you, you are useless. Let me go! -Oh, calm down! -Let me go. Hey, calm down! Dad will never be a writer. He has no talent. You are even worse. You do nothing with your life. I hate you! You are not men! Calm down! Little jerk. Excuse me, do you have a light, please? What happened with Ivan earlier on? Nothing, he is just a little jerk. I don't even know how you manage to teach him. -Stop. -He talks too much. When you experience nothing, you can always talk. He is a little jerk, I can't stand him. Are you done? So, do you remember it or not? Give me some of your beer, please. Thanks. Do you remember the first time we met? It was two months ago, with Laura. You told me you would revolutionize psychiatry. -I am very uninhibited when I drink. -No, but it was lunch time. You told me that Suzanne was the Mont Blanc. -If we removed the Mont Blanc... -There would be a wind-swept plain. Oh so, you do remember? Yeah. Yeah, yeah... Do you think Ivan really hates me? Meet up again soon? I don't know. -What are you doing? -Hush, you'll wake up Dad. What is all this? Hey, calm down, dude. -What time is it? -I am sorry for earlier on. I hope you are too. I have to get up in an hour. That is fine, that way, you are awake. I just want to chat with my little brother, alright? I actually want to do something with my life. Fuck. She is good, your Latin teacher. Oh no, I can't believe it, not her again. Are you not supposed to be in love with Suzanne? I think I am in love with her. How can you be sad about a girl and love another? Did you never love Suzanne? She has a guy. I really am a fricking clown. You never think about anything. What you do means nothing. Hey, not so fast. OK? I will love Suzanne my whole life, but I am a... I am a tiger. You and Dad are completely insane. Come on, stop it with that now. Stop. No, fuck, Joachim, please. Joachim, these are my pens. I will sleep here. I don't want to sleep alone. Oh no, you fricking can't. -You can't sleep either? -I was sleeping fine two minutes ago. -I can't go to sleep. -We can talk about it tomorrow. The reading went alright. I don't care, I am not going to class. Of course you will go to class. I am the elder now. There is no one above me. Since Jean died... -Dad, stop, we are talking nicely. -No. I am between the world of the living and the world of the dead. It is fine, Dad. Ivan, don't listen. In my writing classes, I met a young woman who finds my style is not dissimilar to Tolstoy. That is good, Dad. She is funny. Move over! Like that. We are not going to run, it is too cold. We only started 20 minutes ago. No, we are really going to start running. -Ivan, tell him, we are not running. -I don't care. -Alright, thanks. -Come on, Joachim. This is torture. I can't believe it... Come on, come on, come on. Let's go! I am going for a piss. We will wait for you. Try and do relaxing exercises. If you are really that worried, stop smoking. I am smoking less. Stop smoking completely. -Are you cold? -What? Look at what you are wearing. Here. -I was asked to go to school. -Oh, really? Your brother writes saucy poems, which he distributes to the class. -No? -Yes, erotic poems. -It is very embarrassing. -What a jerk. Do you know what I found in his room? -You searched his room? -No, I did not... Hush. I did not search his room. -I just care about your brother. -I don't believe it. I found religious texts he annotates himself. -Really? -He is obsessed with Christ. Is the kid having a mystical crisis? -Shall we race for a laugh? -Come on. What is the crazy stuff with God? The first one who gets to the end. Oh, dammit! Dad! Dad! Carry him! -Fuck... -Carry him! -I can't! -Sir... -Dad! -Hey, come and help us! -Carry him! -Wait. Call 911. What is wrong with him? -Dad! -Sir, sir. -Carry him! -We need to get him up! Sir... At your age, I could have carried him. Why did you tell him to come? -You have no strength. -Come on, answer me. I wanted to see him, that is all. -Are you Joseph's sons? -Yes. Follow me. No, you stay here, Ivan. Ivan, stay here, please. His arteries will be 70% blocked. Anyway, death doesn't exist. He was just suddenly tired. -Sit down. -No, it is fine, thanks. He was just suddenly very tired. Your dad is fine, but it has weakened him greatly. His artery was over 70% blocked, -which means... -I know, I studied medicine. You know he must be very careful, then. Some gentle exercise and a very healthy lifestyle. No sudden movements, no emotions that are too strong... Is he still allowed to breathe? I am only saying to look after him. I can take you to go and see him, if you wish. Ivan, remain seated, please. Melissa, can I speak to you? -If it is to tell me your filth... -No, what I am going to tell you is serious. So, do you have the balls to tell me? -What? -That you are in love with me? -What? -Don't you want to tell me? -I... -You shouldn't be scared. First, I would like to tell you one thing. Have you been in love with me for a long time? -Soon after we started school. -Go on. Do you have feelings for me? -You didn't think that... -I am sure we would be good together. Sometimes, we think we are in love, but we don't know what it is. -I know I am. -So, what is it? I know we are in love when we believe we can't be alone anymore. -You are not alone. -I am. -No. -Yes! No. Some are really alone. You are not funny. You have your family... That has nothing to do with it! What I mean, is that deep down, we are alone. I am sure, deep down, you understand what I am saying. That is why I fell in love with you. It is because I feel you are a bit like me, we are different. The others don't think about these things, but we do. Do you know what I mean? I don't know. What do you mean exactly? I mean: I think there is something missing, deep down. I think we can cure it by being in love. Have you tried to close your eyes when you are alone in your bed? -Close my eyes when I go to sleep? -No... Melissa. There is a party at mine Saturday night, are you coming? I don't have time. -Leave us alone. -Little shit. When you close your eyes, you try to search what is deep inside you, it is scary. You need to realize if you stop thinking about what is around you and you ask what you are deep down, it is as if, in fact, you were a dot in the void. You know? No? So... We have a soul, OK? If you focus on what there is inside you, on what your soul is, you realize there is only you and that no one else will ever come with you deep inside you. Do you know what I mean? You had thought about it already? I don't know, a bit, I can't remember. Anyway, do you want to go out with me? No. Come on, let's go. Hello? Yes, it is me. Oh, hell... Sorry. Yes, sure. I am coming right away, alright? Yes. Joachim! -What is the matter with you two? -What have I done? Wait until they hear me. Come in. Hello. Joachim, my eldest. Hello. -Sorry. -Please take a seat. You picked the right moment. So, I looked at the file... Do that to Dad, when he needs to be spared. I know... -He is going through tough times... -I am here, ma'am. I know Ivan is going through a difficult time in his life, with your cancer. I don't have cancer. -You don't have cancer? -No. Did Ivan tell you I had cancer? A cancer where? Testicles? No. At the risk of disappointing you, I have only had a mere heart attack. -Oh, I am sorry, sir. -It is fine. I am sorry, Ivan. -Cancer of the testicles, really? -I don't speak to the weak. What has he done exactly? Ivan attacked one of his fellow students. He threatened to throw him into the tiger enclosure. -Tiger enclosure? -They were on a trip at the zoo. -He didn't do it. -Thankfully, no, but his fellow student is a bit traumatized. What is wrong with you, Ivan? I expressed my strength. No, you expressed your stupidity. -You are all losers... -No! Leave, Ivan. Joachim, go with your brother. Wait in Mrs. Prat's office. -How is the other boy? -He is fine, don't worry. -That is good. -But I have to take action. Of course. Meaning? Suspended for three days. He needs to think about his actions. I am going for a smoke. -Hello. -She is not here. It can't be, I come every Thursday. -No, she is not here. -I had an appointment at 3 p.m. Go away. Come back in 15 minutes, alright? OK. -Hello. -Hello. -You are not a student here? -No, correct. -You are not a teacher either? -No, I am not a teacher either. -So, who are you? -Actually, we are colleagues. Well, I am writing a thesis. -Where is your brother? -I don't know. Come on, come. Goodbye, ma'am. Goodbye. -Are you Ivan's big brother? -Unfortunately, yes. He has a certain disposition towards anger. How do you know? Does he come and see you? Yes, I have been here for two months and he comes to see me every week. -So, you are Joachim? -Does he tell you about me? Yes. You are the person he admires the most on Earth, with his dad. Well, your dad. If you can remind him, next time. So, how is it going with Suzanne? Sorry? Oh, I love her so much... Yes, I am sorry, don't get into that state, I am still in training, I am substituting the substitute. -They all had a burnout. -That is horrible. Yes, I know. I only have sad memories. I can't remember what she was wearing the last time where met. I think she was wearing a red shirt, but... I am not sure, maybe it was... maybe it was black or pale rose. You have no happy memory with her? Think carefully, come on. You will find some, I am sure of it. -I have one maybe. -Yes. -It is the loveliest memory ever. -Tell me. We used to do this thing, we went to the top of the city and we would watch Paris. We stayed there for 20 minutes and we... we kissed and we watched the city. -That is all. -It is very good. It is the loveliest memory ever. Have you been back? No, I can only go with her. Ma'am, I had an appointment. -Wait outside, please. -No way, I am staying here. Wait for your turn. Are you not seeing anyone? -A girl, you mean? -A psychoanalyst. I haven't been in touch for a year, I think everything is fine. Are you not Ivan's big brother? Why are you crying like that, man? -He told me... -OK, Sam, please. -What did he tell you? -He told me that... Come on, spit it out. Just that you were not very well. I have developed an ambivalence towards life. Between suffering and indifferent calm. -Do you want to go for a drink? -Yes. Er no, well anyway, you should go back. -To the shrink? -To the city, to see the view. -Don't tell Ivan anything, OK? -Of course not. I also have an ambivalence towards life. Thanks. -Dad, stop the car. -Certainly not. Dad, I want to get out, stop the car! Ivan, no! Ivan! -Hello, my son. -Hello, sir. -What can I do for you? -No one believes in anything anymore. My brother is a wreck and my dad is sick. -Forgive them. -No way. What is your mistake, my son? Sir, I am very in love with a girl in my class, Melissa, but at the same time... I think I want all the girls at my school. I imagine them naked all the time, I can't bear it. I want to be in love, sir. It is serious. You must find the truth in your heart, seize it. In my heart? Try and get closer to it. Are there not exercises that I can do, when I leave? Study your heart, my son. Do you have a light? Your flowers are really superb. -We can go for dinner another time. -What? Are you joking, it is fine. I will just get ready. -What happened with Suzanne? -What? What happened with Suzanne? I heard, but why? Why this question? -It is not just time? -No. Well then, something happened. I can't speak to you about that, when you are half-naked before me. -Tell me. You want me to cover up? -Certainly not. Well... How can I explain it all? We used to live in Athens. Me to write my thesis and she worked as an intern in a hospital. -She was a psychiatrist too? -Yeah. Everything was going well, but I started to see another girl. And then, a second one. Stop, Esther, honestly, because... It is the curse of lovers who are too young. She is the worst. Suzanne is a very devoted girl. She started having an affair with one of her patients. How is that worse? What? I am prepared to be open-minded but up to a point. Are there things you can do but that I can't? Exactly. -Isn't that a bit dumb? -Exactly. What? Did it last a long time with her patient? No, it was short and searing. Like colon cancer. I came back from Athens completely stripped down. -Do you miss her? -No. There are girls like that, who have a strange psychology, who want to repair flaws. It is not necessarily love, it is more... consolation. These girls are dangerous. -What are you doing here, man? -I don't have the keys. -And Dad? -He is having dinner with Agathe. -Why did you not call me? -I did. Well no, you did not call me. Oh you did, sorry. It was on silent. -Were you with Esther? -No, I was not with Esther. You can tell me if you were with Esther. I was not with Esther. I was with Allan. He is going to be a dad. Do you want to grab some food? Come on. -Why go to the pool? -I don't know, I... No, but it is fine. It is great. -See you soon? -I have to hang up, sorry. You didn't get anything to drink? Who was it? My friend. Get a Coke if you want. -What do you think you are doing? -Leave me alone, it is just beer. -Does Dad let you do that? -He is not here, so I think so. What did you do during your three days of suspension? Why do you fricking care? Did you not miss Melissa? The school janitor's daughter? -What did you do? -I read. -Your religious stuff, still? -Not stuff, it is the Old Testament. -You read the Bible aged nine. -I am 13. -At 13, it is good to be your age. -I don't need your advice. What happened, Ivan? We used to be such good friends. I have no more money, however. -You are going to buy me some drinks. -Easy, man. Can we have two shots, the green thing, please? -Yeah, Jet. -It is for me. I have never been this scared. I am going to be a dad. Just that sentence is crazy. You know what we are going to do? Have a shot every 10 minutes and at the fifth, take one every five minutes. You don't care about what I am saying? I am giving you the best answer in the world. So, in 50 minutes, we move on to a shot every five minutes? No, in 30 minutes. You drink a shot in 2 seconds, dude. What do we do between shots? Smoke cigarettes, I don't know. Or we drink beer. Shot, beer, shot, beer. How do you do that? I can't do it, it stings. Listen to me! -No, it stings. -You need to ignore it. -To Laura. -To you. Joachim? My 13-year-old little brother is a complete alcoholic. What do you mean? The guy drinks beers very casually in front of me. He did not look happy last time, right? I don't know what happened, but... Have you ever seen a guy aged 13 happy? -I was happy aged 13. -Yeah, me too, mind you. -Look at what you are now. -What? Man, we should have been sadder at his age. Did you know he believes in God? He tells me I believe in nothing. -No faith in God is not believing? -He is right. -Look at us. -Why us? Look at me, I miss her so much, man, I feel I am... -Mont Blanc. -No, the plain. If you take away the... Anyway. Come on, it has been 10 minutes. I need to go and sleep. Already? I finish this pint and I go home. I know you are going home. See you tomorrow, man. -Joachim, say see you tomorrow! -See you tomorrow! Hey! Let me take you to school! You can pretend you don't hear me, I don't care. Are you going to fight today? Hey, next time, try and fight for real, not those sissy punches! Even from here, you stink of alcohol. Is that Europe's youngest alcoholic telling me that? -Come on, go to bed. -I am taking you to school! Have a good day, Ivan! Dad? Dad? Come on, hurry up, please. -Wait, does it smell of cigarettes? -No. Just a brief quiet moment. Well, I was supposed to go to yours to teach Ivan. He has cancelled, he is going with your dad to an alumni reunion. An alumni reunion? Do you still want to go to Ivan's? Well, I mean, to mine? -Tonight? -Yeah. Do you want to come? I want you to come. Wait. Don't hang up, I have another call. -Yeah, Dad? -Your brother skipped class again. I don't know what to do anymore, I am tired. Why are you going to an alumni reunion with Ivan? I was not going to ask you to come. Anyway, you never do anything with us. -Where are you? -Going for a drive. Do you have the car? I would need it to go to the reunion. Wait, I am using it. Let me call you back later. Tonight, I am coming home with Agathe. Oh yes, good, Dad. Wait, I have to hang up. -Esther? -So, are you going to college? No, I have to go and see someone. -A girl? -What do you mean, "a girl"? If I had to go see a girl, would you be jealous? Wait, don't hang up, two secs. -Yes, hello, sir. -Yeah, who is it? I am the counselor at Ivan's school. Your dad told me to call you to discuss your brother's absences. -Sorry? -He told me... Yes, no, I heard, what is all this? Do you think Ivan is well at the moment? Listen, I have other things to do. Honestly... Call my dad rather, I am not his dad, well our dad, the real patriarch. So, would you be jealous? I don't know. Let me call you back, I have a call. -Yeah. You are very relaxed. -Can you tell me where you are going? Anyway, I am seeing someone, I need to sort something out. -See you at home tonight, then? -OK, see you later. Alfred? -Do we know each other? -I am Joseph's son. -Ivan? -No, Joachim, the eldest. Oh yes, it is true. -I need to tell you something. -But I don't have time. It is important. -What are you doing? -What are you doing? What is that? What is that shit? Why do you have that? Why have you sent a rejection letter to my dad, are you not friends? He was supposed to open his mail. Yeah, fortunately I was there. Do you know he is fragile at the moment? Hey, why are you such a traitor? Why do you refuse to publish my dad? You are crazy. Listen, Joachim, calm down, it is not personal. How can I calm down? What? You know he is fragile at the moment? -Is everything OK, Alfred? -Yes, everything is fine, thanks. Hello. I just want an answer. -Have you read it? -What, the letter? No, your dad's novel. No, I have not read it, but I know he is compared to Tolstoy. -I doubt it. -Please don't be rude, sir. -You are a nightmare. -You are best friends. No, no. I have much affection for your dad, but we are not best friends. Who told you we were best friends? Anyway, in the letter, you say it is incomplete. That means it is bad. It can't be that, right? Yeah, it is not Tolstoy. -It is that bad? -Do you want a coffee? Can you just call him to make an appointment and tell him you have not read it yet? He is fragile at the moment. -It is so cowardly! -Yeah, very cowardly. Do it, please. -Well... -I don't want any coffee, thanks. Allow me. Leave that. -Hello? -Joseph? Yes, it is Alfred. How are you, dear Alfred? So, have you read it? That is why I am calling. Did you like it? No. Well, I mean, I haven't read it yet. -Oh, alright, alright. -I am so busy. No, because I think you could really like it. Then, I would like to tell the kids, because they think I am... You know what they say... -A loser? -No, not that bad. No, no, a douche bag. No, I mainly want to tell Ivan, as the eldest doesn't care about what happens to me. -What shall we do? -Well, let's meet. -Very well. Shall I call you back? -Call me back, yes. See you very soon. What is a "douche bag"? A douche bag is a fool. We don't think he is a douche bag. -We are not staying long, Dad. -We just got here. Honestly, please. Joseph? How are you, Marc? Are you well? Very well. This is Ivan. Hello, Ivan. -It is your grandson? -No, he is my dad. And I have an older one too. -So and your practice... -He is not a doctor anymore. What? Are you not a doctor anymore? Sweetie, can you get us something to drink? Come on... I am a writer. Ivan, pleased to meet you. Ana, hi. Can I get you a drink? -It is free. -Ah, it is true. -I write. -Yes. -Thanks, darling. -Careful, it is not very good. Oh, look at your face. What is his name? Here. See how you look like me? Ana. Oh, Ana! -Do you want to go to the park? -I can't hear you. Come with me. -Jean-Pierre. -Jean-Pierre... Jean? It is fricking disgusting. Do you want some, it warms you up? -I am not cold. -Come on, have some! Leave me alone. My dad used to come here with his girlfriends. Lean your head back. -It is incredible. -See, it is crazy. I want some more. My mom told me stuff about your dad. Did they go out together when they were young? Your dad left it after two days. -What a jerk! -I agree. What, you agree? My dad is not a jerk. It is cherry flavor. It smells nice, right? It is just for the cherry. -I want you to kiss me. -So? -You just need to wear gloss. -What? Some gloss and I will kiss you. Fuck... Alright. So what is your thing about? Where is Ivan? My son, have you seen my son? -You just said gloss. -Do you want to kiss me or not? -Yeah, I want to kiss you. -So, let me do it. -You are pretty like that. -Stop. -You are prettier as a girl. -Are you done now? Ivan? Dammit! Ivan! Come on! Take off what you have on your face. Excuse me, I forgot my makeup remover. My sweetie, I don't want Agathe to see you like that. What? Too familiar with Tolstoy. -We are picking her up. -No, I am getting off, it is fine. No, no, you stay here. Ivan? I am going for a drink with Agathe! You are going home, alright? -The body of Christ. -Amen. -The body of Christ. -Amen. -The body of Christ. -Amen. -The body of Christ. -Amen. The body of Christ. I come to tell you I grieve God. Because when you have desire, you don't need God. -Do you often do that? -What is "that"? Well that, going to someone's house, to... Smoke cigarettes? No, going to a guy's house, when you have a boyfriend... You don't go to guy's house, when you have a boyfriend. Oh yeah... Do you know a law about that? Well, I don't know, a law, no, but morals in relation to God... Me neither, but you should say it with less confidence, still. You never know. It is none of your business. You say that because I am a girl. Do girls' desire scare you? Joachim? -What is it? -Are you alone? Well, yeah. -Can I come in? -No, wait, I am sleeping, dude. Stop calling me "dude." But why, are you alone? Why are you alone, where is Dad? He is having a drink with Agathe. What do you want? No, I just wanted to say you and Suzanne were awesome. I miss her a lot. Sleep well, brother. One second. -Joachim? -Seriously. What is it? -Everything OK? -Yes, everything OK! Ivan? Ivan! Good night, my loves. Joseph, what are you doing? Everything is fine. It is 4 a.m., what are you doing? I am looking for a cigarette. I met Isabelle when I was 18. Isabelle? The mother of my children. She left me... for a fop. A diplomat... Well, not a diplomat. He was vaguely working in an embassy. She left me when Ivan was born. Well, anyway, It is when I met her that I started living as a man. -Can I have one? -Yes. I was very disciplined, you know. Because as I was studying medicine, I was curious, I was avid, I wanted... I wanted to discover everything, know everything. Ever since Jean passed away, I feel like... like when my parents died. I was 11. Eleven! It is Ivan's age, it is too young. You know? Everything I did, I did it so my parents saw me. I won a prize and the day my parents died, they didn't see it. My older brother... He won't see how beautiful you are. He won't read my book. I did everything for our dad to see us and... he dies before seeing us. Give me another cigarette. Fathers can be... so selfish. Like me, with my kids, my darlings... I know what I am like. I was too hard with Joachim. I was too cold, I was... But I so wanted him to understand how lucky he was to have parents. I spoke to his thesis supervisor and he told me what an excellent student he was, quick-witted... Do you know what I felt? Jealousy. Yes... What kind of man can feel jealousy towards his own son? But Ivan... Ivan, it is pure joy. If you knew how joyful it was at home when he was born... Everyone loves him. Joachim slept next to him for a month, I would tell him: "But what are you doing?" and he would say: "I am looking at how Ivan is breathing." I feel like a wounded child. No, but we are all here. A bruised child desperately looking for the gaze of his dead. I am disappointed, Isabelle. I can't understand my kids. They are mysterious to me. I can't understand the world of the living. Sorry... We met at the wrong time, right? It is not that bad. Shall we meet again soon? Do we have to go with you, Dad? Yes, as you bring me luck, you are coming for lunch. No, but it is a work meeting, is it not strange to turn up with your two sons? -Ivan? -It makes Dad happy. Alfred is a friend, he will understand. No, but seriously, I am not going, I will wait. Why do you never do anything for me? Dammit, Joachim, come! Don't be rude. I assure you, I would be happier if you were here. I am staying opposite. Ivan, stay with me. -Come on! -Are you coming, Ivan? Come on! Because we are going to be late. Hang on, is it possible to put whiskey into Coke? Two beers and a whiskey and Coke? Why did you come with your son? Is that a problem? -No. No, no. -Go on, I am listening. -I sent you letters. -No. -I did. -Oh, no, no... I sent you letters, your son hid them away from you. -Ivan? -No, no, not Ivan, the other one. -Joachim? -Yes, Joachim. What is up with Joachim? Why would he do that? He hid the letters I sent you. He even paid me a visit. What are you talking about? He came to see me and... he asked me to publish you. He wanted to convince me. Why... Listen, let's go and chat outside. Ivan, please, can you leave us for five minutes? Are you sure, Dad? I didn't want you to come. What is the matter? You seem almost nice. Did you really go and see that guy in his office? Did you really go? It is incredible. -Show me my nephew. -Your godson, man, not your nephew. Oh yeah, my godson, sorry. We were scared he would have a heart malformation. Oh really? What is wrong with your little heart? But everything is normal, right? Do you want to hear the pulse of a guy who has wallowed for ages? It beats hard, right? It is because of your parents' friend. Because of the Latin teacher. -What are you doing here, Dad? -Ivan has disappeared. What are you saying? I went to the movies, I came out two hours ago and then, I have been waiting ever since and he is not here. No, but he cannot be far, calm down. What did you go and see at the movies? Something dumb. -I am sorry, it is my fault... -It is fine. -Go home. -No... Dad, go home. I will look for him. I am sorry, my sweetie, I... What are you doing? You are completely crazy. No one loves more than me in the world. You'll wake up my parents, they'll kill you! I fear nothing. -Come. -What do you mean, "come"? I am coming. I really want to sleep with you. -Yeah? -Are you OK, my brother? Where you are, I have been calling you for hours? I am opposite school. I love you. Me too, my brother. I am coming. Did you wait for me, Dad? Where is your brother? He had to do something. TWO SONS A FILM BY FELIX MOATI
