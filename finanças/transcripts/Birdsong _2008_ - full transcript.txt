SONG OF THE BIRDS Yes, look at that... It's so beautiful! If you look carefully, you'll discover certain things... At times, we're awestruck with the beauty of things. I wasn't expecting to see such a thing. Now we can see it with our own eyes. He who was born is the son of God. Nobody can ever do anything against Him. Because He is eternal. But those who fight against Him are not. It's worthless for them to try. It would always be in vain. Because they could never avoid their own death. Herod couldn't avoid it either. If we go on top of them, and water falls, we will fall too. But if there is water inside, high up as they are... we will still fall. There might be ice underneath. It might be frozen. - Inside of a cloud? - Yes. We need to know because otherwise... if there was ice, perhaps it could support us. Perhaps. We have been to many places where ice... has supported us. But at times, we sank. Yes, but not too much. Did you get wet? No, ice doesn't get you wet. I just sank in a bit. I don't know if I'll be able to, but I know that wherever you go, I'll go too. Well... if I were you, I'd think it over. We decided you're in charge. - You say "Let's climb!" - I say... if we're going up, let's go. Otherwise, forget it. If we can't... Because we're going to try and you won't be able to. Time to go! Decide. You're in charge. In my opinion, we can climb up to the top where the ice is. I know I can climb up. - Good, let's go. - I don't think we can. I don't think all of us will be able to make it. Some will have to make painful efforts. I don't know how we're going to manage... You're the one who decides. This is what I think: If we climb, it's to the top. If we think it's impossible, too bad. - Lf we can't, we won't go up. - I don't think that... We'll follow you. If we can't... What if we can't? If we know we can't, there's no use trying. I say, wherever you go, I'll follow. As you like. However, we mustn't fail. Fail... no, we still have a few days left. We could come back another day. That's what I'm saying. You're in charge. We'll walk if you do. We said you're deciding: Forward or about-turn. I think I'll be able to... There's a place where we could spend the night. We don't have to walk without resting. Wherever you want. You're in charge. You two decide. If we must climb, so be it. - Otherwise... - lf we must, we'll continue. Even if it's the highest over there. If we must, we must. I don't think he'll make it. - Lf I can, I'll follow you. - Yes, I know. Wherever you'd like. Do you want to go? - We will try. - No, not try. You want to go, let's go. As you like. I don't know if we all agree. It doesn't matter, you're in charge. We may fail because from here it looks easy, but it's different from there. If I'm unable to follow you, I prefer waiting for you here. I know I can climb. We all go, or no one goes. Do what you can. If we can't all do it, nobody will go up. - OK, you decide... - Then, about-turn. Yes... So, about-turn. You want to turn around and not climb. No. Well? Do you think you can follow? You're the one in charge... We still haven't decided! Do we turn around or climb? We've been discussing without doing anything for some time. - He, who's in charge, decides. - I told you... I'm turning around, but you don't know what you want. Go on, I'll wait for you. In that case, let's go back down. I'm ready to go wherever you want. He is in charge... Should we go back down? Could you lean a bit more on your father? You're always on top of me. You're on top of me. It's comfortable for you. Yes, very... with my neck like this! You're not comfortable? Darn it! Can we find a better way? Not in this uncomfortable position. It would be better if we spread out. OK, let's spread out. Because otherwise... We're on top of each other... Shall we sit up and spread out? Forget it. Try to hold out a little longer. "A flat country", yeah, right! Move over there, please. Look at this! Unbelievable! They're everywhere. Can you move? Move away from the branch. Move! There's no room. Good God... You always find the best spot! In the middle of the branches... There's room, but not much. That's better. Nobody crush me. We're a bit more comfortable now. We need to get up and find... a bigger place. I think that's a good idea. Let's go. - You don't won't to stay? - Come on, try. Move over. Let me out, I want to get out of here. Can't you get up without... without me moving? And you'll stay all alone. Do you mind moving so I can get up? Not like that! More! Shall we go? Let's go and leave him here. This way, over there. Over there! It came out. - Where is it? - Over there. Do you want me to hold it? Should I let it go? Yes. I let it go, I hold it... I can't. Joseph... Come up. Come on! Do you want some oranges? One? Look. Look at the sky. It's very beautiful. What time is it? Seven or eight o'clock? Is it almost Saturday? What do you want to do? I don't know... Here, want some more? No, thank you. Is the child sleeping? Jesus is already asleep? He peed on me! What's wrong, Mary? Come here. Do we have water for the sheep? Go fetch some water. We have some? You want it? I'm very hot. It's very... Come see Jesus... Mary, what are you doing? What's going on? Who are they? Look what they're bringing you... What are these gentlemen bringing you? We don't have a lot of time. Egypt is still far from here. We must leave now. The Romans are coming tonight. We don't have much time. I had a dream. I saw one of our Lord's angels who told me that we must flee to Egypt. Yes, he's breathing. We won't be coming back. We've had enough of this sand. It's too hard. We're like slaves. Do you understand? Like slaves. One day, I saw an angel fly out of the sky. He was flying. Tell us more... Once, high in the sky, I saw an angel flying. For a long time? Yes, he flew in all directions. Did you dream it? No, I didn't dream it. I said, "saw". There are many angels. Very many. And they're all good. They're all good, that's for sure. They're peace. Peace, tranquility... And love. Those hunters, who knows if they hunt with spears and axes... Do they kill a lot? I guess they hunt with axes, spears... Perhaps they killed... What do they hunt? Deer, wild boars? Some sort of mountain goat... How did they carry it? They carried it in a bag. Last night, in my dreams, I saw goat horns. Large ones? They curled around four or five times. Like this, four or five times and they stretched out. Like this. They stretched out. What did you hear? A baa... Were the goats dying? No, I just heard their cries. I don't know what was happening, but they were crying. Did you see how they carried them? Yes, I saw that too. - How? - They carried them around their necks. Like this... With two branches? Yes, one did. The other carried it without branches. I think they were hunters. Yes, hunters carry them suspended. - Not you? - Not me. I often dream of strange things. Yes. Once, I dreamt of goats that hunted and ate the hunters. Yes, yes... The goats ate the hunters. But that was just a dream. Of course, a dream. It's impossible. Yes, of course it's impossible, but... it's a dream. I saw naked men in the clouds. They were jumping from one cloud to the other. From top to bottom, from left to right... What were they doing? They were jumping. Where were they going? He doesn't know where they were going. I almost always dream about angels. Everyone has their own dreams. I don't like dreaming too much... I do. I always dream... of beautiful things. One day I dreamt that a snake was on top of me and it was biting my neck. - I dreamt... - I was bleeding everywhere. I dreamt that I was inside of a snake and it was crawling on the ground. Mine is even worse... I dreamt that a snake was eating me. It was very fat and very long and it gulped me down. It grabbed me and sucked me into its mouth and swallowed me whole. All snakes should be thrown in the fire. When I woke up, it was horrible. I woke up and I was still inside the snake. "How do I get out?", you thought. The angel said to me, "You'll get out!" And suddenly, I was out. - You flew out? - No, I didn't fly out. I was on the ground, out of breath. The angel came down and helped me. Are you cold? I'm not cold. Are you cold?
