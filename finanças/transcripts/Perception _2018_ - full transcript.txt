Hey! Hey! I didn't even hear you pull in. The city approved the plans. -Take a look. -Sure. -So how long for the demo? A couple of days tops. Look at it. As soon as it sees the bulldozer, it's going to fall over. You know, you are you doing them a favor. Next storm that passes through, that'd do the job for you. What the--? Hey, do you see anything? Yeah, back up. Thanks. What the hell? Jesus Christ! Are you trying to kill me? What the hell are you doing back there? Kid, out of the car! Now! What-- what's wrong with you? Are you deaf? Kid, come on. Get out of my car. Get out of my-- hey, we can do this the hard way. Come here. -Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. calm down, buddy, calm down. You're okay. You're okay, right? Stop. So, where did you come from? Do you belong to someone around here? Excuse me, is this your--? Okay. -Thanks so much. I'll see you next week. -Sure thing. Hi, can I help you? I think I found something of yours. This little guy belong to you? Yeah, that's my son. -Is everything okay? -Well, not really. I was out in your lot parked for about two minutes and he tried to stow away in the backseat of my car. I was halfway out on the street before I noticed he was there. Hugo, are you okay? Baby, did you go outside? You're supposed to stay right here when mommy's with a client. You know that. I brought him back right away, but you might want to try keeping a better eye on him. I mean you might not be so lucky next time. Excuse me? Next time? No, no, no. I'm just saying I'm a nice guy. At least I'm not one of those psychos you read about. -Do you have kids? -No. Yeah, I didn't think so. Look, I don't know who you are, -but I don't appreciate you coming into my store-- -Whoa, whoa, whoa. Your kid tried to run away. I brought him back. He's fine. Nothing happened. You alright? Right? See? We're all fine. I didn't mean to cause you any trouble. I just want to make sure you knew he was okay. I'm sorry. He's never done anything like this before and he's not like-- -thank you for bringing him back. -No problem. I was a bit adventurous when I was a kid myself. Just like you. buddy. He's got a thing for cars and trucks and all that. I can see that. Oh, you're a pretty talented artist for such a little guy, you know? -Actually, I was meaning to come in here. -You'd like a reading? A what? Oh, you're the-- I see. No, actually, I needed to talk to you. This is your store? I share the space with another healer. Oh, but you're on the lease? No, his name is on it and my mom's. They've been renting here for years. -Are they around? -No. He'll be back soon. And my mom, uh, is retired. Oh, okay. Well, see, the reason I'm here is I represent the new owner. We're redeveloping this whole block. Tearing it down. I mean... I'm sure you already knew that since-- I'm sorry. Maybe I should just talk to him when he's around. I'll come back. You can wait, if you want. He should be back soon. Okay. Let me give you a reading, on the house, as a way to say, you know, thank you for not kidnapping my son. A reading? Um, sure, why not? Hugo, baby, you stay right here, okay? Do not move. You understand me? Follow me. Tell me your name. Daniel. -Hello, Daniel. -What's your name? -I'm Nina. -Pleasure to meet you, Nina. Place your hands on mine, palms up. You have a strong will, but... you're impulsive. Alone. No family. And your work... you enjoy it. The competition. You like to win. Who doesn't? Well, ambition can be dangerous, but I see great success for you and soon... This deal that I have-- No. More than that. -Wealth. -I guess that's a good thing. If it's what you desire. Close your eyes. -You have a spirit following you. -Following me? I thought so, when I first saw you. Oh, Daniel. You've suffered a great loss. She-- you keep her very close. -Maggie. -Your wife? Uh-- Yeah. She's never very far from you. Can-- Can you talk to my wife? I can only feel her presence now. -I can't engage her. -Please. It takes time to develop a rapport with the spirit. How long? That depends. We'd have to build trust. That's Jro. He's the one that you wanted to see about the lease. Come back. We'll do another session. -Excuse me. Are you Jro? -Honey. I'll be whoever you want. What can I do for you? Why don't I ever get clients that look like that? Oh, come on. You know he's handsome. Is he single? Jro, aren't you upset about the store? Well, I could tell something like this was going to happen. It's in the air. And besides, I haven't had a new client in months. This place is finished. No, we don't need some sexy Angel of Death to tell us that. The universe wants us to move on. Oh, and look. He's making escape plans. Hugo wandered out earlier when I was with the client, the first one I had all day. That guy Daniel saved him. -Saved him? -Brought him back. Oh, he has a heart and a big fat throbbing wallet in those jeans that cost more than our rent. -Did you see anything good? -His wife died and I felt something there. Honey, you feel that dead wife all the way to the bank, you hear me? What? Clients like that don't come around very often and men like that don't come around ever. He needs your help, and you need his. Mona, there you are. I knew you'd be in today. I felt your energy the moment I woke up this morning. You're radiating very strongly. Mm-Hm, come in. Come in. Have you saved up enough for those crystals we need? -Yeah. -Hey, my man. How'd it go? Fine. No baseball bats this time. You were gone so long. Hey, listen. I need you to send the eviction notices by certified mail so they can't complain that they didn't get them. Right. I was going to put stamps on them. Oh, no. I need you to actually go to the post office and get them certified at the counter. Okay. Uh, hey, uh. When do I get an intern or something? -You don't. No intern. -I really feel like I'm ready for more responsibility. -Yeah, like what? -I want to do what you do. -Teach me. -Look, Andrew, it's-- it's your first week, man. -Why don't you just-- -Slow my sweet buttery roll. Hold my horses. Hold my stallions. -Yes, you do that. -Just calm it down. Right, take a chill pill, rectally. You can go. Yeah, I'm sorry. I knew there was a reason I came in here. There was a reason I came in to talk to you. My dad was-- I mean, sorry Peter-- not my dad, Peter was asking if you could come in and update him when you get a chance. Okay, tell him I'll be right there. Up top. No? Shut the door. Bye. -Peter, you wanted to see me? -There he is. -What are we celebrating? -I just wanted to toast my new senior VP in style. Senior VP? You've cleared those zoning hurdles in record time. And the way you hustled those tenants out of there. Did you tell them about all the asbestos? -What are you drinking? Rye? -That's great. Listen, you're pulling in better numbers than ever. The Tenth Street redevelopment is going to be big money for this firm... and I want you to run point. -Um, Peter. -I don't want any excuses, Daniel. I need you. I won't let you down. Good. Now, keep up the pace. The bulldozers move in the moment we close. Cheers to that. Good morning, Hugo. Hi, Nina. Hi, good morning. I'm sorry that we're late. Uh, that's no problem. Do you have a second? We need to chat. Yeah, sure. So, I don't know if you're aware but Hugo's been a bit aggressive lately. -What do you mean? -Well, for starters he stabbed me with a pencil yesterday. Oh, my God! Hugo did that? -I'm so sorry. -It's an occupational hazard. -Has anything changed at home recently? -No, no, nothing. Well listen, um, next year class sizes increase significantly. And if anything, Hugo needs more attention, not less. -I don't understand. -It's a much more unstructured environment when they move into the new building. I'm just not convinced that Hugo would thrive there. You want to hold him back? It would be good for him, but I can't. The district wants kids like Hugo to flow through the system as quickly as possible. Okay, so then what? Well, there are special schools designed for students like Hugo. I think he could really thrive in one of these programs. -Private school? -You're paying for more attention. I know it can be expensive, but there are subsidies you can apply for. -How much are they? -It varies. -Around 30,000. -A year? I know it's a lot. Just think about it, okay? It could be really good for Hugo. Yeah, okay. Thank you. Um, I'll figure it out. Hey, you're not in this alone. I mean, it is like he just deleted me from his life. -Our session's almost over. -Okay, I just... got to find this one text 'cause I think that if you read it, you'll-- you'll get a feeling. I don't need to read the text. I can read the energy. He's not the one. I knew it. He is such an asshole. -I'm going to die alone. -No, no. Another man is going to come into your life. A tall, dark-- a better man. Really? That must be my next client. That's going to be fifty. Oh, my God! Thank you. I feel so much lighter. You know what? I'm deleting his number. Hmm. Insurance should really cover this. You are so much better than therapy. Oh... -Ah. -Excuse me. -Hi. -Hi. You're back. I didn't know you could surprise a psychic. I want you to talk to my wife. It's not that easy. I told you, it takes time. And even if I do, what happens next is really up to her. I want to try. I have to try, please. I'll pay you. Mediumship is rare. I can't predict what it might take to try to connect with her. -How much? -Five hundred for today. Well, you were right about one thing, promotion, money. The universe is clearing the way for you to reunite with Maggie. So, how long you have been doing this? I used to watch my mother. She has the gift, too. I guess it must run in the family then, huh? You can say that. It's supposed to skip a generation. -I guess you just got lucky then. -Are we going to use that? Crystals are for looking into the future. We are going somewhere else. Well, does it really work? If you choose to believe it. Some people need symbols like this to create a space where they can believe. You and I don't need those things. We have real work to do. -I don't think we should do this. -Why? -The energy I feel, it's dark. -Dark? Angry. Right now, Maggie is on the other side. If we start trying to connect with her, I can't promise you that she's going to stay there. You mean like she's going to try and haunt me or something? I mean I already can't get her out of my head. I'm just saying it's dangerous to mess with these things. You have to have the right intentions. -You doubt my intentions? -No. I just want to make sure that you understand the risks. I didn't realize that she would be angry. Let's keep going, please. I'm seeing an image, a woman's face. It's a drawing, I think. The painting. Maggie was an artist. Daniel, thank God you're here. Welcome to the Freak Show. Ah, you must be Andrew. Your father has told me so much about you. -Congratulations on your show. -I know. It's all happening. It's just like, "What? I don't understand it." Dad, if you could move a few steps back from the art. There's a vibe that you're disrupting. Marcus, uh... You need a drink. Where's the bar--? Oh, here. Grab one of these. Yeah. Yeah, you know, mix, mingle, look at the... art. This is great. I'm working on it for a while. Sure. It's a metaphor. We call her mentor. I mean he said next proper option but... Do you paint a lot of this? I do. It's a metaphor. -Great. -Yes. Excuse me. It was nice seeing you again. Oh, my gosh! I am so sorry. It's fine. Well, it's my fault. Are you alright? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine but look at your shirt. Oh, no, no. it's fine. Don't-- don't worry about it. I'm very worried about it. -Here, come with me. -Oh, Maggie! Oh, I'm sorry. I'll-- I'll be right back. Oh, I'm such a klutz sometimes. Oh, God. That painting... the faces out there, that's yours? It's hideous, right? I was going to say more like haunting. You're very talented. Well, I didn't mean to make you my next canvas. That stain is going to set. You need to take that off. -Uh, what? -Your shirt. Take it off. So we can soak it. I-- I don't think that-- okay. Okay. I'm sorry. I just need a minute. It's a bit much out there. Someone's in here. Um-- I'm Daniel, by the way. Daniel. Daniel. Hi. I don't think that's going to work by the way. -What? -I don't think it's going to be dry. Shit! Yeah. Um-- I didn't really think this through. -Oh, here. -I don't think it's going to-- No, no, no, no, no. It will, it will. I just have to wring it all out. -I said just a minute. Honey, are you in there? That Freeze writer wants to talk to you. Um, okay. I'm coming. Um, sorry, I-- I have to go. What about my shirt? Um, well, figure it out. -Maggie, he's leaving. Okay, I'm coming. Um... It was nice meeting you, Daniel. Hey, these are for sale, right? She's gone. Um, like-- like gone gone? -For now. -I want more time. It doesn't work like that. On her terms. She guides the sessions. Why do you think that she wanted you to remember that? I don't know. Will she come back? Uh, not today. So that's it? Maggie sent you a message. Focus on that. See where it takes you. -Do you feel that? -What? A spirit. Oh, yeah? Who is it this time? I don't know her. Alright, Hugo. Take a pit stop. You got to go brush your teeth. Alright, can you say goodnight to Nana? That's not Hugo. Alright. Let's turn this off. And they all lived happily ever after. The end. Alright, time to go to sleep, baby. I love you. Just leave it. Take off your pants. What are you doing? I'm feeling inspired. We should go away. Oh, we could go lay on the beach. Let's go to Tulum. Tulum, let's go. What do you say? It sound-- that sounds like a nice idea, but I can't really go away right now. My gallerist will kill me if I don't have something to show at the end of the month. Oh, right. Do you mind? It's just really hard to work while I'm being watched. Oh. Oh, do you want me to go? Sorry. Is that horrible? I just feel a real creative burst coming on. Oh, you... feeling somewhat inspired right now? By me? Like-- like your muse or something? Sure. That's one way of thinking about it. I don't ever want to be apart from you, Maggie. You're so sweet. Look, Daniel, um, you know, we've been having a lot of fun, -but-- -Oh. But I really need to focus on my work right now. -It's everything to me. -Stop. Please, stop. One day I'll be ready to settle down, but now I get to put my work first. And I'm so grateful for that. Can you understand? What are you saying? Things have just been getting really intense. Why don't we just take a minute and let things cool off for a bit and then see how we feel? Why? I know how I feel. I love you. You barely know me. Sorry, I-- I didn't mean it like that. Look, I told you I wasn't looking for anything serious. -I knew it the first moment I ever saw you, Maggie. -Daniel-- When I saw your painting-- See, this is exactly what I'm talking about. You're being way too intense. You're forcing me into this conversation with you and I just want to put this energy into my work. I just told you I love you. Daniel... Look... Why don't we just forget about it, okay? We can talk about it later. I really have to work. -So you really want me to go? You're ruining this. Yeah, yeah, I really want you to go. Here... please. -Why that? -What? Why do you want to hear about that? It has nothing to do with me. Maggie wanted you to revisit it. Not every memory can be a happy one. Yeah, well that was a long time ago. We got through it. You know I'm not paying you to relive the worst memories of my marriage. I thought you wanted to reconnect with Maggie. I mean... isn't that why we're here? Yeah, well that wasn't her. She wasn't like that. She loved me. This isn't good enough. We're done. You, obviously, can't handle her. This is not enough for me. I can try to channel her, but it's not easy work. What's it going to take? -Just give me the number. -Ten thousand. Here, this is for today. Sorry about your store. -Maggie? -Ah! I'm sorry. I thought you were-- never mind. -Nina! Oh, hi. Is Nina here? -No. Are you packing up already? You still have two weeks on the lease. Huh? Do you see any clients? The only thing left here is your construction. -Will she be back soon? -No. -I really need to see her. -Well, I don't know. Maybe she thought you weren't coming back after your last session. -Do you know where she is? -I don't know. -You don't know where she is? -Oh, I know where she is. I don't know if I want to tell you. Please, I really need to find her. I did everything she said and I have what she asked for. Oh. Well, do you think I need to bubble-wrap her? Are you going to tell me where to find her or not? Dude, you are throwing me out of my shop. Have you thought about where I'm going to go? What I'm going to do? Have you thought about Nina? You're a lifesaver. Lucky number seven takes the lead, but Big Red is hot on its heels and we're at the finish line. It's Big Red! Big Red is the winner! Oh, the crowd goes wild. Mom, the crowd goes wild. Clap your hands, Mom. Alright. Can you clean up your toys for me? Cookies are going to be ready in five minutes. Hugo, can you get that for me? Oh, hey, little man. Do you remember me? -Hi. -Hugo, go play with your toys. -What are you doing here? -I had to see you. I have to see Maggie. I've got the money. You shouldn't be here. Look, I'm sorry that I got frustrated or whatever. I shouldn't have left things like that between us the other day. This work, what we're doing, this is-- this is important to me. Please. -Shit! Sweetie, it's okay. Sh. Sweetie, I'm going to be right back, okay? Can you stay with Nana? -You can't just show up here. -I'm sorry. I needed to see you. Here, the first half. Consider it a down payment. So, you'll do it? I don't have my studio anymore. We can use my house. Good. Can we do it now? I need time to prepare. I see her everywhere. That means that she's ready. Okay. Just talk to her. Um, Maggie... um. Are you there? I'd really like to talk to you, babe. She's here with us. Maggie, we call upon you tonight to reconnect you with Daniel from whom you were taken too soon. We open up this channel for you to return. My body is your vessel and I yield it willingly. Do you have the message? You have to write it down. Don't tell me what it says. Now what? Now we're ready. Arms up. Oh, uh. We have to be closer. Move behind me. -Like this? -Closer. -Whoa! Nina, breathe. Nina, Nina, help. Nina, what can I do? What's wrong? Nina? Nina. Oh, my God! Nina, can you hear me? Nina. Nina, breathe. Fuck. Breathe. Shit. Nina? Nina, breathe. Nina, can you hear me? Maggie? -Maggie. Maggie. Fuck. Maggie. I have a headache. That was... I can't believe you're here with me. Daniel, it's me, Nina. Nina? -Maggie's gone. -What? No. -Already? -Sorry to disappoint you. -Well can you bring her back? -I'm going to be sick. -Sorry. Uh, can I--? Are you okay? Can I get you something? You know, I didn't know-- was that-- I don't know, was that-- was that okay? I didn't know she would, uh.. you know, that we-- I didn't know that was going to happen. You two have an intense connection. I felt it before. When I invite her in I-- I can't control what's going to happen. Okay. Oh, shit, I have to go. I want to do it again-- see her again. We can get her back. It's just-- it'll be harder, you know. -It'll take more time. -Whatever it takes. I really have to go. Right. Nina... thank you. Yeah? I hear you. And I understand that. Yeah, I'm not going below 1.7. I've got a wait list a mile long for this property. They come in at 1 7, we got a deal. No, you've got till the end of the day. Yeah. That-- that is how you make that money. That is how you make that money! -Woohooho! Oh, so, uh, your bank just called. Um, they said that your wire transfer came through. I wasn't sure if it was your bank or the company bank. I didn't want to say because I know that you want me to sound like I know what I'm talking about on the phone. Yeah, right. Um, that's a personal thing. If they call again, just put it through to me. You got it, Mr. Vice President. I always knew you're going to land a big one. So, is it you or is it her? Whatever the way I see it, it's all healing. He's very demanding. It's pretty exhausting actually. Well, manual labor will do that. What are you going to do with all the money honey? -Hugo's new school and God, a nurse for mom. -Hmm. If I could find anybody that she won't drive away. And you, I'm going to get all of that back that I owe you. Oh, girlfriend, please. It all comes out in the wash. I do have to say that all that sex has done wonders for your complexion. You glow, girl. -Stop. -What? It's been so long. I thought you forgot how to do it. This looks good on you. Local bank in hot water over easy business loans tonight at eleven. I don't like uninvited company. Moi? It's okay. Hugo, how's it going? Are you getting busy in there? Huh? Oh, not your usual. You're branching out. Well, all great artists go through phases. It's a sign of growth. Please, don't leave me this time. I knew from the first moment I ever saw you we were meant to be together forever. Hugo. Hugo. Are you alright? What's happening? -Oh! Uh! I can't do this anymore. We have to end this. Why? She is gone. You have to let her go. No. -Daniel. -No, I said no. Daniel. You know what it was an intense session today. -Let's talk about this later. -No. No. This isn't over. Daniel. Maggie wants it to be over. No. No. No, no, no. That wasn't the deal. She wants to be with me and I can't live without her. Daniel, I have a life. I can't be here all the time. She's my wife. She is-- She is my wife. I need you to help me be with her. Please. Ple-- -I'm sorry. -Please. I have to go. You're just going to leave? Oh, my God! Jro! Jro! Peter, hey, hey. Oh, no, no, everything's perfect. Yeah, we are set to start demo tomorrow morning, man. We're going to knock this bitch down. I got some bad news, Daniel. We're going to have to pull the plug on the redevelopment. -What? Why? -The bank has frozen all pending loans. They're being investigated by the state. -We've lost our funding. -But I have bulldozers there right now. We're starting demo tomorrow morning. What's the value on the land without the new structure? We might have to do a short sale on the property. Uh... not even half. Peter, I've been working on this for months. Look, that's the business. This shit happens. Well, you're taking this awfully philosophically. Dude, I took a Valium. Look, knock it down, don't, I don't care. Just get this albatross off my books. My masseuse is here, I got to go. Peter. Fuck. God. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Oh my-- Oh, fuck. Right now, hmm. Who the fuck is this? What? -His health proxy? - He chose you to make decisions for him if anything were to happen. How is he? Is-- is he going into surgery or-- We are taking him into the OR shortly. You'll have to wait for an update from the doctor. Do you know if he has any supplemental insurance, -long-term care policies? -No. No, he-- he doesn't believe in insurance. Did he set anything aside for an emergency? I'll take care of it. Whatever it is, just give him the best. It's going to be very expensive. I'll take care of it. Okay. I'll need your billing information, please. -Hi, this is Nina, leave a message. -Damn it. What? -Everything alright in here? -Fine. What is it? Peter wants to see you immediately in his office. -He says it's urgent. -Tell him I'll be right there. -He wants you now. -I said I'll be right there. Okay. Oh, my God, I remember what I wanted to tell you. I heard the most random thing last night. Do you remember that girl Mallory at my art show? -Didn't-- didn't you guys hook up? Anyway-- -Maggie. Her name was Maggie. Right. She died. I had no idea. I totally thought she moved to L.A. and got famous or something. Oh, she was so talented. Of course, she died young. I should have done that. -Oh, so sad. Did you know? Bye. Hey. Andrew said you needed to see me right away. Daniel, come in. Shut the door. Take a seat. What's going on? -Daniel, this is Marlene, our lawyer. -Hello, Daniel. -I'm here to witness your meeting. -An innocent bystander. Daniel, I received a phone call last night from our accountant. At first I thought that there must be some mistake but he assures me he's certain. -Does this surprise you? -Do you recognize these transfers from the Tenth Street redevelopment fund? -I-- I don't know. -They appear to have been wired into an account belonging to you. -Peter, may I speak with you privately? -I'm sorry, -it's impossible. -Peter... Please. -What were you thinking? -It was only supposed to be in advance on my commission when the funding fell through. I was going to put it back. Why didn't you come to me? I-- I couldn't. Look, I can fix this. -I'll get it back. -Daniel, it's too late. No. It was a mistake. I can get it all back. I can get it back. Peter, please, just give me this chance. Please. Either the money's back in the account by the end of day or I'm calling the police. That's all I can do. Thank you, Peter. Thank you. You won't regret it. I regret ever hiring you. -I trusted you, Daniel. -Peter, I-- -I don't want to know about it. And Daniel, it goes without saying but... you're fired. Make sure you only take what's yours. ¶ You put your right hand in ¶ ¶ You put your right hand out ¶ ¶ You put your right hand in ¶ ¶ Now you shake it all about ¶ ¶ You do the hokey pokey... ¶ -Nina, I need to talk to you. -What are you doing here? -Daniel, you cannot show up at my son's school like this. -I know, sorry. I can explain. -You wanted to reconnect with your wife. You got that. -Look, it wasn't my money. -What are you talking about? -It was supposed to be mine. The deal, it fell through. Some issue with the bank. -We're getting our store back? -No. We're still knocking it down and selling the lot. It's an eyesore. Look, I advanced myself my commission from the sale of the lot to pay you. I'm not getting that now. Do you understand what I'm saying? Yes. And I already told you no refunds. Nina, you-- you have to help me with this. I'm sorry, Daniel. This has nothing to do with me. It has everything to do with you. You dragged me back in that studio for the reading. I didn't make you do anything. And, by the way, I don't have my studio anymore -because you kicked us out. -Nina, if I don't replace that money, I'm going to go to jail. -I don't have it. -What? -You couldn't possibly have spent ninety thousand. -I have expenses. Hugo! Hey, little buddy. Hi. You don't remember me? I'll get your money, right? It's the only thing. I'll pay you back. I just need you to lend me that money back now. I already told you I don't have it. -This conversation is over. -You sound like fucking Maggie. I am not fucking Maggie. Excuse me, are you here for a pickup? -What? Are you here for a pickup? Come on, sweetie. Get in. Get in, get in, get in. No. I'm sorry. Mom. It's getting cold. Do you want your sweater? -Oh, I'm fine. -Let me help you. I can do it. Nina, go back and do your homework. Can't you see clients are waiting for me? I don't want you watching TV. -Mom. -Baby, what is it? I think I made a big mistake. That man. -What? -That man, he came to this place. You remember him? Mom, did you ever go too far with a client? I did what I had to for my family. I have a daughter. I want her to go to a good school. I had a lover once. He came to me. He had lost his daughter. She was abducted. It was in the paper. He wanted to reconnect with her. He felt responsible. He asked me if I would help him. Did you do it? I couldn't find her. Maybe she was still alive. Maybe she didn't want to be found. He was broken. So I said what he needed to hear. I thought I could fix him. What happened? He broke my arm. You have to protect yourself. You know her? Mom, that's Hugo. No, I don't think so. Come on, let's go inside. Sir, can you hear me? You've been in an accident. She-- She is here. The other driver? They took her to the hospital. I can't-- she's-- Sir, I need you to stay with me. Can you follow my finger? Keep your eyes on me. Can you do that? -Is he drunk? -I don't think so. Thanks for the ride. Coming. -Daniel. -Oh. -Is everything okay? I had to see you. What are you doing here? -I got your messages. -What messages? In your art. Your painting. You've been speaking to me. -I don't understand. -We can be together. We can make this work. I know we can. I love you so much, baby. I'm here now. You don't have to go. You're not going. Wait a minute, you're not making any sense, Daniel. -Please, let go of me. -Baby, I'm here. You don't have to worry. I'm here. Look, it's been months. You really shouldn't be here. I need you to go, okay? No more pretending, Maggie. I know you need me. -I know it now. -Daniel, you don't sound well. I really think you better leave. Is that it? -Daniel. -It's incredible! It-- It's not finished yet. I love it. I get it. I get it. Get what? I get this. I understand you. Um, it's late. Why don't we just talk about this tomorrow? Maggie, you don't need to hide anymore. It's me. Look, I think you have the wrong idea. Stop with the act. It's just us. I know the truth. I know you're painting for me. Let me be very clear. I have no idea what you are talking about. -Look, I-- I've been seeing someone else. He's on his way over here. So I really think you better go. We don't have to be apart. I can help you. I can support you. -I love you, too. I do. -Daniel! Please. Don't you understand what I'm saying to you? Look, this is a mistake. This is all in your head. Sh, don't do that. It's okay. It's okay. Everybody-- everybody makes mistakes sometimes. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. You love me. Okay, it's time for you to go now. -No. -Daniel. -No. -Yes, Daniel, come on. No! -Daniel. -No! Why are you lying? What are you doing? No! No! Stop it! what are you doing? Stop. Stop it. Stop it. What are you doing? No. Why are you doing this? Why? Why are you doing this? I'm all you need. You told me that in the painting. I don't understand. You want me here. We are supposed to be together. Just go. Maggie. Get out of here! -The other driver? -They took her in first. Should be in surgery already. So what's he still doing here? A couple of GSW is downtown. Emergency is backed up. Figures. Look, I'm going to grab a cup of coffee. Let me know when he is awake. We got lot of questions. Poor girl. Hugo, I need to set the table. Yes. Hi. Yeah, this is she. No, I've been waiting for an update. So he's still in surgery? Wait, is that bad? Mom, can you turn that down? Yeah. Yes. No, I'll be over there later tonight. Okay. Yeah, thank you. Bye. Hugo. So the gallery called today and they want to give me a solo show. I know. I know. My own solo show. -I'm going to have the gallery for a full month. - That's great, honey. Now I just have to figure out which pieces to show. When's the opening? Maybe dad and I can come down. Um, it's-- it's the first week of June. I'd love it if you could come. Are you kidding? We wouldn't miss it. -We're so proud of you, Maggie. -Thanks, Mom. You know, I really better run. Clause wants to introduce me to a few local collectors tonight and I don't want to be late. Let me know how it goes. You'll do great. Thanks. I can call you after. -Alright. Bye-bye. I love you. -Okay. Love you, too. Bye. Maggie! Maggie! Maggie. Oh, my God. Maggie. Hello. Hello. 911, what is your emergency. Yes, yes, help. There's an accident, uh, Thorn Davis, the corner. Please help us, someone's been hurt. Send help. Come on, Maggie. Come on. You're okay. You're okay. Sit here. Sit here. Just breathe. Breathe, okay. Open your eyes. Babe, you open your eyes. Can you hear me? Can you hear me, Maggie? Maggie, look at me. Breathe. Look at you. You're okay. You're going to be just fine. I'm here. I'm here baby. It's me. We're together. We're together. It's okay. It's okay. -Hey, she alright? -She's fine. She's-- -she's fine. She's fine. She's fine. You're going to be alright. I love you. I love you. -I love you, Maggie. Maggie. Maggie. Maggie. Maggie, breathe. Breathe. Don't go. Don't-- don't go. Not yet. Not yet. Not-- come back. Baby, you come back. Come back. Baby. No! No, Maggie, no! He made it through surgery. The next few hours are crucial. If he survives the night, he'll pull through. Thank you, doctor. Thank you so much. Okay, bye. -Daniel, go away. -Oh, goddamn it. Nina, open up. I don't have the money. I just-- I-- I-- Nina, please. I just want to say goodbye. Um, I'm leaving town. No, Daniel. Nina, please. I need to say goodbye to Maggie. I want you to go. Daniel? No! Ah! You think you can say no to me? I'm giving you everything, more than I had. Daniel, please, my son is home. Where is it, huh? Where's the money, Nina? I told you. I don't have it. It can't be gone. Where is it? I'm sorry, it's gone. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I paid you to hear her voice and now I have nothing left. -Nothing. -No! -She's dead. Maggie is dead. -But you can bring her back to me, -so I can fuck with my wife. -Stop. -No! She wasn't your wife. -What? -You used her and left her alone. Shut up! You don't know what you're saying. You killed her. -I loved her! Mind you, she fucking wants me. She wants me. Get out of here! Hugo. No. Please-- Sh-- -What's going on here? -No, Mom, stay in your room. He isn't breathing. He isn't breathing. Daniel. Ah! -No, stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Ah! Hugo. My sweet baby.
