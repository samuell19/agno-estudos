[SOBBING] AHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! * MUSIC * MUSIC * MUSIC I'M GOING TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. ANDREW MASON IS NOT A KIND MAN. SOME WOULD EVEN CALL HIM GREEDY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIKE HIM. I KNOW I DON'T. BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE HIM A CRIMINAL. THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAS PAINTED A PICTURE OF ANDREW MASON AS A TYRANT, SOMEONE WHO WOULD STOP AT NOTHING TO GET WHAT HE WANTED, SOMEONE WHO WOULD GO SO FAR AS TO MURDER HIS COMPETITION. I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THE DA, BUT NOT TODAY. DURING THE TRIAL HE HAS TRIED TO MANIPULATE YOU, TO USE THE ANGER WE ALL FEEL TOWARDS CORPORATE BIGWIGS WHO THINK THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING. BUT ALL HE HAS OFFERED YOU IS INNUENDO AND CONJECTURE. WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE? WHERE IS THE PROOF? THERE IS NONE. WE HAD AN EXPERT WITNESS REFUTE THE CRIME LAB'S DNA ANALYSIS, SHOWING THAT IT WAS FLAWED, THAT MY CLIENT'S DNA WAS IN NO WAY CONNECTED TO THE CRIME OR THE CRIME SCENE. YOU HAVE A SOLEMN DUTY, A DUTY TO ENSURE THAT AN INNOCENT MAN NOT GO TO JAIL, A DUTY TO FIND ANDREW MASON NOT GUILTY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HELP, DOCTOR. ANYTIME. I DO LOVE WATCHING YOU IN ACTION. CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU. KATE. I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH. THE ACT ABOUT NOT LIKING ME, I THINK THE JURY REALLY BOUGHT IT. WHO SAYS IT WAS AN ACT? THE TRUTH IS WE'RE NOT SO DIFFERENT YOU AND I. WE BOTH DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. MISS WILSON. MISS WILSON. WE WERE CONFIDENT THAT JUSTICE WOULD BE SERVED TODAY AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. THANK YOU. THAT'S ALL. DID YOU GET ALL THAT? YEAH, I GOT IT. TIME TO MOVE ON. TIME TO MOVE ON. [CELL PHONE RINGING] KATE WILSON. THAT'LL BE FINE. WE'LL SCHEDULE THE DEPOSITION FOR LATE NEXT WEEK. THANKS. THANKS. SHOULDN'T YOU BE CELEBRATING? MAYBE LATER. I'VE STILL GOTTA SORT OUT CONGRESSMAN JOHNSON'S PLEA ARRANGEMENT. I SAW THE NEWS. THE PRESS LOVES YOU. I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOUR INVESTIGATIVE HELP. SO, WHY AREN'T YOU CELEBRATING? I DON'T KNOW. WHEN I WORKED AT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE I FELT LIKE I WAS GIVING INNOCENT PEOPLE A CHANCE WHO NEVER GOT ONE, LIKE I WAS DOING SOME GOOD. I MISS THAT. I THINK ANDREW MASON WOULD SAY YOU DID A LOT OF GOOD TODAY. YOU KNOW THERE'S NO SIN HAVING CLIENTS THAT CAN ACTUALLY PAY YOU WHAT YOU'RE WORTH. I GUESS. TAKE THE AFTERNOON OFF. GO CELEBRATE WITH SOME FRIENDS OR FAMILY OR SOMEBODY. [LAUGHS] YOU KNOW I WON'T. WELL YOU CAN'T SAY I DIDN'T TRY. AND, UH, IF YOU NEED ANYTHING DON'T HESITATE TO CALL. THANKS, LANCE.

I'M SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT CHERYL. DID SHE ALSO TELL YOU THAT YOUR FATHER AND EVERYONE ELSE THINKS I DID IT. YEAH, BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN THERE OR TALKED TO HIM IN YEARS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO. I NEED A LAWYER, KATE. YOU'RE THE BEST I KNOW. DON'T YOU ALREADY HAVE ONE? YOU MEAN THE PUBLIC DEFENDER THEY APPOINTED ME? I DON'T THINK HE EVEN KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING. AND YOU CAN'T AFFORD BETTER? WITH WHAT MONEY? ALL OUR MONEY WAS IN A SHARED ACCOUNT. THEY FROZE EVERYTHING. I'M SCARED, KATE. THE WHOLE TOWN THINKS THAT I'M GUILTY. THEY WON'T EVEN GIVE ME A CHANCE TO PROVE I'M INNOCENT. LOOK, I KNOW IT'S BEEN A WHILE AND I'M SURE THIS IS PROBABLY THE LAST THING THAT YOU NEED, BUT I WOULDN'T HAVE CALLED IF IT WASN'T IMPORTANT. AND WE SAID WE'D ALWAYS BE THERE FOR EACH OTHER IF WE NEEDED SOMETHING AND... I KNOW. I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO DO THE RIGHT THING. YOU ALWAYS HAVE. I REALLY NEED YOU, KATE. I REALLY NEED YOU, KATE. * MUSIC * MUSIC * MUSIC HEY, LANCE. IT'S KATE WILSON. I'M HEADING OUT OF TOWN FOR A FEW DAYS TO VISIT A FRIEND WHO NEEDS SOME HELP. I DON'T KNOW.

BECAUSE WE SAID THERE WEREN'T ANY INTERVIEWS. I'M NOT A REPORTER. KATE. HEY, DAD. SURPRISE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? DAVID CALLED. I THOUGHT I'D COME AND SEE WHAT I COULD DO. WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED? YOU DON'T COME VISIT YOUR FAMILY FOR WHAT, A COUPLE OF YEARS. THE MINUTE HE CALLS YOU COME RUNNING. HE NEEDS MY HELP. BESIDES, I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE WE COULD-. THOUGHT WHAT? OTHER PEOPLE NEEDED YOUR HELP, KATE. YOU DIDN'T COME. DAD. WHAT ABOUT YOUR MOTHER? IS HE MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHEN SHE NEEDED YOU? DO YOU WANT TO FIGHT AGAIN? DO YOU NOT REMEMBER WHY I LEFT IN THE FIRST PLACE? HE STABBED CHERYL FIFTEEN TIMES WITH A BUTCHER KNIFE. HIS PRINTS WERE ALL OVER THE THING. FINE. I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW THAT I WAS HERE BEFORE YOU HEARD IT FROM SOMEONE ELSE. GREAT. GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK, KATE. JUST GREAT. I'LL BE BACK IN AN HOUR. ALWAYS NICE COMING HOME. ALWAYS NICE COMING HOME. HEY. IT'S PETE. YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHO JUST WALKED IN HERE. * MUSIC * MUSIC * MUSIC YOU CAME. YOU ASKED ME TO COME. YEAH. I DIDN'T REALLY THINK YOU WOULD. THIS IS SOME PLACE. IT'S MORE LIKE A PRISON TO ME. I STEP OFF THE GROUNDS I GET SHIPPED BACK TO AN EIGHT BY EIGHT CELL. MAYBE YOU SHOULD TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED. MY LIFE HAS TURNED INTO A LURID TABLOID. THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED. COME ON IN. COME ON IN. SHE ALWAYS LOVED TO RIDE. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU KNEW HER DIDN'T YOU? A LITTLE BIT. SHE WAS MORE MY SISTER'S AGE. OF COURSE SHE WENT TO HILLCREST. AREN'T YOU GOING TO ASK ME? ASK YOU WHAT? WHETHER I STABBED THE WOMAN I LOVE FIFTEEN TIMES OR NOT. I'M NOT YOUR ATTORNEY, DAVID. I WOULD NEVER HURT CHERYL. I SWEAR ON MY FATHER'S GRAVE. OKAY. OKAY? THE WHOLE TOWN THINKS I MURDERED MY WIFE AND THE BEST YOU CAN SAY IS OKAY. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY? I WANT YOU TO SAY THAT YOU BELIEVE ME, THAT SOMEBODY IN THIS WORLD BELIEVES ME. WHY DID YOU COME HERE? I CARE. I FOUND HER IN THE BEDROOM. I FOUND HER IN THE BEDROOM. I FOUND HER IN THE BEDROOM. I CAME HOME AND I FOUND HER JUST LYING THERE. I TRIED TO HELP HER. IT WAS TOO LATE. I CALLED 9-1-1. THEY FOUND YOU WITH THE BODY? I HAD HER BLOOD ON ME. I WAS CHECKING HER PULSE. IF I KILLED HER, WHY WOULD I COME BACK? WHY WOULD I CALL THE POLICE? WHO DO YOU THINK KILLED YOUR WIFE? A ROBBERY? I DON'T KNOW. SOME OF HER THINGS WERE MISSING, SOME OF CHERYL'S JEWELLERY AND CASH FROM THE SOCK DRAWER. STABBING SOMEONE FIFTEEN TIMES SEEMS MORE LIKE A CRIME OF PASSION. DAVID? DAVID? IT'S SO HARD BEING IN THIS HOUSE. IT'S SO HARD. I HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO. COME ON. LET'S TAKE A WALK. COME ON. LET'S TAKE A WALK. I CAME HOME A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT. WORKING LATE? NO, NO. CHERYL AND I HAD BEEN OUT EARLIER AND WE HAD A LITTLE DISAGREEMENT. I JUST NEEDED SOME TIME TO MYSELF. YOU HAD A FIGHT THE NIGHT SHE WAS KILLED? IT WAS NO BIG DEAL. IT WAS JUST AN ARGUMENT. I CAME HOME AND FOUND THE BACK DOORS BUSTED OPEN AND THEN I FOUND HER. THE NEXT THING I KNOW THE COPS WERE HERE. THIS IS AS FAR AS I CAN GO, AT LEAST WITHOUT GIVING YOUR FATHER AN EXCUSE TO LOCK ME UP AGAIN. WHAT ABOUT YOUR PUBLIC DEFENDER? OH, HE THINKS I SHOULD TAKE THE DEAL. DID THE DA OFFER ONE? LIFE IN PRISON, NO CHANCE FOR PAROLE. YEAH, THAT'S WHEN I CALLED YOU. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I CAN DO, BUT I'LL HAVE A LOOK AT EVERYTHING AND SEE WHAT POPS UP. I HAVE ALL OF THE DISCOVERY IN THE HOUSE. I BETTER GET STARTED. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. YOU TOO. I KNOW THIS IS A LOT TO PUT ON YOU. IT'S WHAT I DO. I'M USED TO IT. LOOK, DAVID, I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR. I SHOULDN'T REPRESENT YOU. WE HAVE TOO MUCH HISTORY. I UNDERSTAND. I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. * MUSIC * MUSIC * MUSIC [KNOCKING] HELLO? IS ANYONE THERE? [KNOCKING] [KNOCKING] MISS WILSON? MIKE CARNAC, SANTA PAULA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY. DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE? A LITTLE LATE, ISN'T IT? YEAH. SORRY ABOUT THAT. I JUST FIGURED YOU'D BE UP TO YOUR NECK IN CASE FILES. COME ON IN. THANK YOU. HEY, IT LOOKS LIKE I WAS RIGHT. YOU DON'T WASTE MUCH TIME DO YOU, MISS WILSON? YOU DOVE RIGHT INTO THIS STUFF, HUH? JUST HELPING OUT A FRIEND. BOYFRIEND, DON'T YOU MEAN? OLD BOYFRIEND. IF I WERE YOU I'D BE CAREFUL. CHERYL WALKER FELL FOR DAVID AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO HER. YOU SEEM TO KNOW A LOT ABOUT ME. WELL DAVID WALKER BRUTALLY MURDERED THE DAUGHTER OF ONE OF THE LEADING CITIZENS OF OUR TOWN. IT'S MY JOB TO MAKE SURE THAT JUSTICE IS BEING SERVED. THINGS WOULD'VE WORKED OUT A WHOLE LOT EASIER IF WALKER WOULD'VE TAKEN THAT PLEA BARGAIN. WE COULD'VE AVOIDED ALL THIS NONSENSE. I'VE NEVER CONSIDERED DUE PROCESS NONSENSE. NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME. WE'VE GOT AN AIRTIGHT CASE. MOTIVE, OPPORTUNITY AND HIS FINGERPRINTS ALL OVER THAT KNIFE. FROM WHAT I'VE READ YOU'VE GOT A HALF-ASSED INVESTIGATION, SLOPPY SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS AND A CASE BUILT MOSTLY ON CONJECTURE. YOU SEE. I KNEW IT. I JUST KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO COME TO THIS TOWN AND TRY TO TURN THIS CASE INTO A CIRCUS. WELL LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. YOU MAY GET YOUR HEADLINES IN THE BIG CITY, BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WIN THIS TOWN OVER. HE'S NOT EVEN MY CLIENT. GOOD. WELL THAT'S GOOD, BECAUSE THIS TOWN NEEDS TO MOVE ON AND PUT THIS BEHIND US. WHY, MIKE? YOU UP FOR RE-ELECTION SOON? WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO HOME, MISS WILSON? THIS DOESN'T CONCERN YOU. YOU KNOW WHAT MY PROBLEM IS, MIKE? THE MORE PEOPLE TELL ME TO LEAVE SOMETHING ALONE, THE MORE I JUST WANT TO DIG IN. FUNNY, THAT SOUNDS A LOT LIKE MY FOUR-YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. [LAUGHS] I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION. DAVID WALKER IS GOING TO GET EXACTLY WHAT HE DESERVES. NOW YOU HAVE A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP AND ENJOY YOUR READING. NOW YOU HAVE A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP AND ENJOY YOUR READING. NOW YOU HAVE A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP AND ENJOY YOUR READING. YOUR HONOR, THE DEFENSE WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST A MOTION FOR CHANGE OF COUNSEL. YOUR HONOR, THIS IS RIDICULOUS. A CHANGE OF COUNSEL THE FRIDAY BEFORE THE TRIAL STARTS? MY NAME IS KATE WILSON WITH STERN-BUCKINGHAM IN SAN FRANCISCO. DAVID WALKER HAS RETAINED ME AS LEAD COUNSEL FOR HIS DEFENCE. IS THIS CORRECT, MR. WALKER? YES, DEFINITELY. SHE'S THE ONE I WANT. THEN LET ME BE CLEAR THAT THERE WILL BE NO EXTENSION ON THE TRIAL DATE. OPENING STATEMENTS ARE ON MONDAY. YOUR HONOR, I CAN'T POSSIBLY BE READY THAT QUICKLY. THEN PERHAPS MR. WALKER WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE HIS MIND AND RETAIN HIS CURRENT COUNSEL. UH, NO. I WANT KATE WILSON, YOUR HONOR. THEN THE MOTION IS GRANTED. I WILL SEE YOU ALL ON MONDAY MORNING. THIS IS A LAST MINUTE STUNT, PURE AND SIMPLE, A TRICK TO DELAY A KILLER'S DAY OF JUDGEMENT. MR. DIENZA, DO YOU BELIEVE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IS TRYING THE RIGHT MAN FOR YOUR DAUGHTER'S MURDER? I DO. NOTHING CAN BRING CHERYL BACK, BUT IF THERE IS ANY JUSTICE IN THIS WORLD THE JURY IN PANEL TODAY WILL RECOMMEND DEATH FOR THE MAN WHO KILLED HER. HE USED TO TREAT ME LIKE FAMILY. HE'S GRIEVING. HE'S A GOOD MAN. WE SPENT SO MUCH TIME TOGETHER. HOW COULD HE EVEN THINK I WOULD DO THIS? VICTIM'S FAMILIES OFTEN NEED SOMEONE TO BLAME, SOMEONE TO PUNISH FOR THE PAIN THAT THEY'RE FEELING. I WAS FAMILY. ROY DIENZA IS ALSO ONE OF THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTORS TO THE DA'S POLITICAL CAMPAIGN. I GOT A VISIT FROM THE DA LAST NIGHT. I MADE A FEW CALLS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT YOUR OPPOSITION, ESPECIALLY THEIR MOTIVES. MISS WILSON, ARE YOU PREPARED TO DEFEND DAVID WALKER THIS QUICKLY? IT'S EASY TO DEFEND SOMEONE WHO'S INNOCENT. CHERYL WALKER DESERVES JUSTICE, BUT I FEEL THAT THE RUSH TO FIND CLOSURE HAS LED TO MISJUDGEMENT. WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT'S WHAT THE JURY WILL DECIDE ONCE ALL THE FACTS OF THE CASE ARE PRESENTED. DAVID, IS THAT TRUE? ARE YOU INNOCENT? THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING. THAT'S ALL. THANK YOU. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? MR. DIENZA, PLEASE. FOR GOD'S SAKE, YOU USED TO SELL GIRL GUIDE COOKIES WITH CHERYL AND NOW... HOW CAN YOU DEFEND THIS MONSTER? ROY, PLEASE, I SWEAR TO YOU I WOULD NEVER HURT CHERYL. I LOVE HER. DON'T YOU EVER MENTION HER NAME, YOU SON OF A BITCH. HEY! I HOPE YOU ROT IN HELL. RELAX! ROY, YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT AGAIN AND I'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO TAKE YOU IN. COME ON. LET'S GO HOME. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND. YOU OKAY? FINE. WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF STUFF TO GO OVER. SEE YOU BACK AT THE HOUSE. HEY, LOOK WHO'S BACK. YOU WEREN'T EVEN GOING TO CALL AND SAY HELLO? I MISSED YOU, SIS. HOW'S THINGS AT HOME? NOT SO GOOD. ERIC'S OUT OF WORK. HE WORKED FOR DAVID, YOU KNOW. THEY FIRED HIS CONSTRUCTION TEAM AFTER CHERYL'S DEATH. BUT I DON'T WANT TO BURDEN YOU. I KNOW YOU'RE VERY BUSY, TOO BUSY TO EVEN VISIT I GUESS. JUST AFTER THE FIGHT DAD AND I HAD... FAMILIES FIGHT, KATE. IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY STOP SPEAKING TO EACH OTHER. AFTER MOM DIED HE JUST NEVER FORGAVE ME FOR COMING BACK. I KNOW YOU'VE GOT A LOT ON YOUR PLATE, BUT I WOULD LOVE IT IF YOU COULD COME TO DINNER TONIGHT. NO, I REALLY-- EMILY WOULD LOVE TO SEE HER AUNT KATE AGAIN. ARE YOU SURE THAT'S A GOOD IDEA? DOES IT LOOK LIKE I'M GOING TO TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER? [LAUGHING] COME ON. COME ON. COME ON. I KNOW I'M JUST A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR, BUT HOW DID YOU GET YOURSELF INTO THIS? IT JUST SORT OF HAPPENED. EXPLAIN TO ME HOW DEFENDING A MURDER DEFENDANT AT A TRIAL STARTING IN THREE DAYS JUST HAPPENS. HE'S AN OLD FRIEND. YOU SHOULDN'T BE DEFENDING ANY KIND OF FRIEND. THAT'S A CLEAR CONFLICT OF INTEREST. KATE, WHAT'S GOING ON? THIS ISN'T LIKE YOU. IT'S COMPLICATED. YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T DO IT UNLESS IT WAS NECESSARY. ALL RIGHT. LOOK, I HEARD THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE THAT THE FIRM WAS THINKING ABOUT MAKING YOU A PARTNER. DOES THIS GRAPEVINE HAVE A NAME? NO. AND DON'T TELL ANYONE I TOLD YOU. OH GOD. WHAT? WHAT IS IT? I THOUGHT IT WAS THE LOCAL WELCOME WAGON AGAIN. APPARENTLY SOMEBODY IS NOT TOO HAPPY THAT I'M ON THIS CASE. SHOULDN'T YOU BE CALLING THAT COPS? I'VE DEALT WITH WORSE. YOU BE CAREFUL. YOU'RE THE BEST THE FIRM HAS OVER THERE. YEAH, I WILL. YEAH, I WILL. DID YOU MARRY CHERYL FOR HER MONEY? NO. I LOVED HER. BUT IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE GOTTEN USETO THE MONEY. I'VE ALWAYS MADE MY OWN MONEY. I HAD MY OWN CONSTRUCTION COMPANY BEFORE I EVEN MET HER. BUT YOU WEREN'T OVERSEEING THE BUILDING OF MALLS, WERE YOU? THAT'S A PRETTY BIG STEP UP FOR A LOCAL CONTRACTOR. THAT'S RIDICULOUS. BECAUSE I WORKED FOR A LIVING I KILLED HER FOR HER MONEY? YOU KILLED HER FOR HER MONEY? IS THAT WHAT YOU JUST SAID? NO. THAT'S NOT WHAT I... YOU'RE TWISTING EVERYTHING I SAID AROUND. THIS IS EXACTLY WHY YOU CAN'T TAKE THE STAND AT YOUR TRIAL. I JUST SAID THAT I WANT A CHANCE TO DEFEND MYSELF. THAT'S MY JOB. YOUR JOB IS TO SIT THERE AND LOOK LIKE EVERY MEMBER OF THE JURY'S BROTHER, SON OR BEST FRIEND. WHAT'S THE USE? I HAVE NO ALIBI. PEOPLE THINK I KILLED HER FOR HER MONEY. MY PRINTS WERE ON THE KNIFE. THE KNIFE IS FROM YOUR KITCHEN. OF COURSE YOUR PRINTS ARE ON THE KNIFE. AND MONEY IS A STRONG MOTIVE, BUT I SEE NOTHING IN YOUR FINANCIALS TO SAY THAT YOU WERE SPENDING EXCESSIVELY OR IN DANGER OF LOSING WHAT YOU HAVE. WHY ARE YOU HERE? WHY ARE YOU HELPING ME? WHEN I WORKED FOR THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE I WOULD GET A LOT OF CLIENTS WITH NO MONEY AND A MOUNTAIN OF EVIDENCE AGAINST THEM, BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I WOULD LIKE IN THEIR EYES AND SEE THAT THEY WERE INNOCENT. MAYBE I SHOULD NEVER HAVE LEFT IT. MAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN A JOB WITH THE BIG FIRM. I MISSED FEELING LIKE I COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE. SO YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE YOU WANNA FEEL LIKE YOU MAKE A DIFFERENCE? WHY? WHY DID YOU THINK I CAME BACK? I MISSED YOU, KATE. DAVID, DON'T, PLEASE. I LOVED CHERYL. I DID. BUT I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU SOMETIMES. I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT WE MIGHT HAVE HAD. YOU AND I, IT'S A LONG TIME AGO. I CAN BARELY REMEMBER IT. ROMANTICISING IT ISN'T GOING TO HELP. I'M NOT ROMANTICISING. I'M TELLING YOU HOW I FELT. WHEN YOU WENT AWAY TO COLLEGE I WAITED FOR YOU. I WAITED. I SUPPORTED YOU. AND THEN I FINALLY REALIZED YOU'RE NOT COMING BACK. THAT HURT. IT WASN'T BECAUSE OF YOU. I JUST KNEW MY LIFE WASN'T HERE ANYMORE. WHEN MY MOTHER DIED, I KNEW I HAD TO LEAVE, EVEN THOUGH I KNEW IT MEANT LEAVING MY DAD AND LEAVING YOU. WHY? WHAT WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT YOU HAD TO LEAVE? I KNOW I COULD'VE HANDLED THINGS DIFFERENTLY, BUT WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN US, THAT'S NO ONE'S FAULT, DAVID. NO MATTER WHAT, WE CAN'T GO BACK TO THE WAY THINGS WERE, NO MATTER NOW WONDERFUL THEY MIGHT'VE BEEN. TOO MUCH HAS HAPPENED. I NEED A CHANGE OF SCENERY. I NEED A CHANGE OF SCENERY. I NEED A CHANGE OF SCENERY. MUCH BETTER. OKAY, I'M READY. FIRE AWAY. WAS THERE ANYBODY ELSE WHO MIGHT'VE HAD A MOTIVE TO KILL CHERYL? NOT THAT I KNOW OF. YOU SURE? SHE WORKED ALL THE TIME OR SHE WAS RIDING AT THE STABLES. THERE WERE PEOPLE THAT WERE AGAINST THE MALL, BUT NOBODY CRAZY. WHAT ABOUT MEN? ARE YOU ASKING ME IF SHE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR? NO, NO, NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT. NO. YOU'RE THAT CERTAIN? WE HAD UPS AND DOWNS JUST LIKE ANY MARRIAGE, BUT WE WERE FAITHFUL. OKAY. WHAT ABOUT FRIENDS? ANYBODY SHE WAS PARTICULARLY CLOSE TO? UM, YEAH. JENNA MAYHEW. THEY RODE AT THE STABLES ALMOST EVERY DAY ALMOST. DID YOU KNOW HER? I'LL BE HONEST. MOST OF HER HILLCREST FRIENDS WEREN'T EXACTLY THRILLED THAT SHE MARRIED ME. LOOK, I'M GOING TO NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT CHERYL, THINGS A HUSBAND MIGHT NOT KNOW. I DON'T WANT TO DRAG HER NAME THROUGH THE MUD. WE CAN ONLY DO THAT IF SHE WAS HIDING SOMETHING. * MUSIC * MUSIC * MUSIC [CELL PHONE RINGING] KATE WILSON. WHO IS THIS? [DIAL TONE] * MUSIC * MUSIC * MUSIC [HORSES NEIGHING] OH, I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. * MUSIC * MUSIC * MUSIC WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I WAS WONDERING OF YOU HAD A FEW MINUTES TO TALK. ABOUT CHERYL? YEAH. I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY. YOU DON'T THINK I'M SORRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED? IF YOU WERE YOU WOULDN'T BE DEFENDING HIM. ALL I WANT IS THE TRUTH. FINE. YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND WAS A LOUSY HUSBAND. HOW'S THAT FOR TRUTH? I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE SETTLED. SHE SHOULD'VE JUST LEFT HIM. WHY DIDN'T SHE? WHO KNOWS? SHE HAD HER CHANCE. WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? WAS SHE SEEING SOMEONE? THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE? YEAH. SHE NEVER SAID WHO IT WAS, BUT I THINK THEY USED TO MEET HERE SOMETIMES AFTER WORK. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO? SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING TO BREAK IT OFF. SHE SAID SHE COULDN'T RISK RUINING HER FATHER'S RELATIONSHIP WITH DAVID. AND NO ONE KNEW ABOUT IT? NOT EVEN HER DAD. NOT EVEN HER DAD. HEY, LANCE, IT'S KATE WILSON. I NEED YOU TO LOOK INTO A FEW THINGS FOR ME IF YOU'RE AVAILABLE. AS FAST AS YOU CAN. I'M ON ONE HECK OF A TICKING CLOCK ON THIS ONE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, KATE? I THOUGHT IT'D BE A NICE DAY FOR A RIDE. YOU KNOW, DIGGING UP DIRT ON MY SISTER ISN'T GOING TO HELP ANYONE, LEAST OF ALL YOU. AM I ABSOLUTELY CLEAR? ARE YOU THREATENING ME? LEAVE IT ALONE. LEAVE IT ALONE. LEAVE IT ALONE. HEY, DAD. UGH. COME ON, DAD. CAN WE PLEASE JUST GET THROUGH THIS ONE NIGHT, FOR BETH? FINE. DADDY SAYS YOU HELP CRIMINALS GET AWAY. IS THAT WHAT HE SAYS? I THINK BAD GUYS SHOULD GO TO JAIL. I THINK THEY SHOULD TOO. SO WHY DO YOU HELP THEM? WELL THE PROBLEM IS SOMETIMES THE PEOPLE WE THINK ARE BAD GUYS HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG. I JUST GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO PROVE IT. SO YOU ONLY WORK FOR GOOD BAD GUYS? SHE'LL WORK FOR ANYBODY, SWEETIE, AS LONG AS THEY'RE PAYING HER ENOUGH. ISN'T THAT RIGHT, KATE? ERIC, JUST GRAB THE STEAKS. WE'LL MAKE IT THROUGH THIS. I PROMISE YOU. I PROMISE YOU. I PROMISE YOU. CAN I BE EXCUSED AND GO INSIDE? SURE. SO, KATE, WHAT'S IT FEEL LIKE TO DEFEND A COLD-BLOODED KILLER? HONEY. DOES THE PHRASE INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU? NOT WHEN WE ALL KNOW HE DID IT. I DIDN'T INVITE KATE SO THAT WE COULD ARGUE. TELL ME DAD, DID YOU EVEN CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION? WHAT IF YOU HADN'T LEFT? THAT COULD'VE BEEN YOU. AHHHH! EMILY! STAY HERE! STAY HERE! DADDY! DADDY! DID YOU HEAR THAT? DADDY! AHHHH! AHHHH! DADDY! HEY. YOU ALL RIGHT, SWEETIE? COME HERE. SWEETIE, YOU OKAY? DAMMIT. ERIC, DON'T TOUCH THAT. ARE YOU HURT? YOU OKAY? DID YOU SEE ANYTHING? NO. IT'S TOO FAR AWAY. HOW'S EMILY? SHE'S A LITTLE SHAKEN UP, BUT SHE'S NOT HURT. BASTARDS. IT'S THE SAME TRUCK THAT RAN ME OFF THE ROAD YESTERDAY. WHAT? WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D CARE. KATIE, I'M YOUR FATHER. OF COURSE I CARE. DID YOU SEE ANYONE? NO ONE'S FACE, BUT... BUT WHAT? KENNETH CAME UP TO ME AT THE EQUESTRIAN CENTER. WHAT, CHERYL'S BROTHER? DO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF CAR HE DRIVES? WHY? YOU DON'T THINK HE DID THIS, DO YOU? HE THREATENED ME ONCE. KATE, I DON'T WANT YOU NEAR THIS HOUSE AGAIN. YOU HEAR ME, KATE? YOU STAY AWAY FROM MY FAMILY. SORRY, FRANK. KATE, MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST LET THIS THING GO. IT'S JUST NOT WORTH THE RISK. YOU KNOW ME BETTER THAN THAT, DAD. I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO THE MOTEL. ALL RIGHT. YOU BE CAREFUL. I'LL BE RIGHT BEHIND YOU. I'LL BE RIGHT BEHIND YOU. I'LL BE RIGHT BEHIND YOU. LONG NIGHT, DEPUTY? YEAH. SHERIFF ASKED ME TO KEEP AN EYE ON YOU LAST NIGHT, MA'AM. THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE IT. I'M HERE TO SERVE. I'M HERE TO SERVE. WELL YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SIGN FOR ALL OF THIS. I'M VERY AWARE OF HOW CHAIN OF CUSTODY WORKS. LOOK, WE ALL READY RAN ALL OF THE DNA TESTS. THE REPORTS ARE RIGHT THERE. YOU ONLY RAN AN STR? THAT'S KIND OF OLD SCHOOL. WELL IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO FIND THE MURDERER'S PRINTS. ALL RIGHT. WELL THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HELP. I'LL SEE YOU ON MONDAY. YES YOU WILL. AND YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME. THAT GUY'S A PIECE OF WORK. WHAT DOES HE THINK THIS IS YOUR FIRST TRIAL? DO YOU HAVE TIME TO RUN AN AMPFLP ANALYSIS? NO, BUT FOR YOU I'LL MAKE IT HAPPEN. THANK YOU. CHERYL WAS SEEING SOMEONE. I NEED TO KNOW WHO IT IS. MYSTERY LOVER, HUH? I'LL START WITH THESE TEXTS AND EMAILS. I ALL READY WENT THROUGH ALL THE PAPERWORK. I COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING. YOU MIGHT HAVE TO DIG A LITTLE DEEPER. JUST THE WAY I LIKE TO SPEND MY WEEKENDS. THANK YOU, BOTH OF YOU. THIS MEANS A LOT TO ME. YOU'RE VERY WELCOME. [CELL PHONE RINGING] KATE WILSON. HEY, I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO COME BY THIS MORNING. I'VE GOT A FEW STOPS TO MAKE FIRST. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. I'LL LET YOU KNOW IF ANYTHING COMES UP. SO I JUST SIT HERE AND WAIT? I KNOW. IT'S FRUSTRATING, BUT IT'S BETTER THAN BEING IN A JAIL CELL. SMALL BLESSINGS I GUESS, RIGHT? ALRIGHT. I'LL SEE YOU LATER. I'LL SEE YOU LATER. [PHONE RINGING] DIENZA RESIDENCE. IT'S KATE WILSON FOR ROY. IS HE EXPECTING YOU? NO, BUT TELL HIM IT'S ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER'S DEATH. NO, BUT TELL HIM IT'S ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER'S DEATH. NO, BUT TELL HIM IT'S ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER'S DEATH. EXCUSE ME. RIGHT THIS WAY. RIGHT THIS WAY. HE'LL BE RIGHT HERE. HE'LL BE RIGHT HERE. HE'LL BE RIGHT HERE. I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'VE COME TO APOLOGIZE. I HAVE NOTHING TO APOLOGIZE FOR. I UNDERSTAND YOUR GRIEF IS DEVASTATING, BUT DAVID WALKER DESERVES A FAIR TRIAL. WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT HE'S GETTING. WE DON'T NEED YOU FOR THAT. WE BOTH KNOW HE'S NOT GETTING ANYTHING CLOSE. WHY DO I GET THE FEELING YOU'VE BEEN OBSTRUCTING THIS INVESTIGATION, MR. DIENZA? I HAVE DONE NOTHING OF THE KIND. HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE YOU PAID OFF TO KEEP CHERYL'S REPUTATION INTACT? PEOPLE LIKE JENNA MAYHEW? YOU KNOW NOTHING OF MY DAUGHTER'S LIFE. BUT YOU DO, DON'T YOU? MORE THAN YOU'D WANT TO KNOW I'M SURE. DID YOU KNOW THAT CHERYL WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR? GET OUT OF MY HOUSE. HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS MYSTERY MAN ISN'T THE ONE WHO KILLED HER? BECAUSE THEY FOUND DAVID WALKER STANDING OVER HER BODY. HE DID THIS. HE TOOK MY BABY GIRL AWAY FROM ME. YOU WANT VENGEANCE. I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO STAND BY AND LET YOU WITHHOLD EVIDENCE FROM THIS INVESTIGATION OR USE YOUR MONEY AND POWER TO BUY YOURSELF A CONVICTION, OR TO RUN ME OFF. YOU KNOW SOMETHING; YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE COME BACK HERE. BUT I DID. AND IF I FIND OUT YOU'VE BEEN WITHHOLDING INFORMATION I WILL COME AFTER YOU AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WITH EVERY WEAPON IN MY ARSENAL AND I WILL TURN YOUR LIFE AND CHERYL'S PAST INSIDE OUT. NOW I SUGGEST THAT YOU HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH DISTRICT ATTORNEY CARNAC IMMEDIATELY. AND IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING PERTAINING TO THIS CASE OR TO YOUR DAUGHTER, I BETTER HAVE IT BY TONIGHT. I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO YOU. I'D CHECK WITH YOUR ATTORNEY BEFORE YOU SAY THAT. I'D CHECK WITH YOUR ATTORNEY BEFORE YOU SAY THAT. YOU GOING TO THREATEN ME AGAIN? MY FATHER'S BEEN THROUGH A LOT. I DON'T APPRECIATE YOU PUTTING HIM THROUGH MORE. I KNOW WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING, KENNETH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING ME AROUND, WHY DON'T YOU JUST LET JUSTICE TAKE ITS COURSE? THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I INTEND TO DO. I DON'T CARE WHO YOU OR YOUR FAMILY ARE, BUT DAVID DESERVES A FAIR TRIAL JUST AS MUCH AS ANYONE ELSE. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SCARE ME OFF. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET ANY HELP FROM US. AM I CLEAR? IF I FOUND OUT THAT YOU OR YOUR FATHER ARE HIDING SOMETHING, I'LL SEE TO IT THAT YOU BOTH GO TO PRISON FOR OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. AM I ABSOLUTELY CLEAR? FINE. YOU REALLY WANT TO HELP YOUR BOYFRIEND, LOOK AT THIS. WHAT IS IT? CHERYL WAS FILING FOR DIVORCE. THEY SIGNED A PRENUP WHEN THEY GOT MARRIED. DAVID WASN'T GOING TO GET A PENNY. SEE WHAT THAT DOES FOR YOUR CASE. THIS IS DATED A MONTH BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED. YEAH. SHE DIDN'T NEED TO USE IT. MAYBE SHE HAD SECOND THOUGHTS. BUT THIS IS MOTIVE. WHY WOULD YOUR FATHER KEEP THIS A SECRET? I DON'T KNOW. I ASSUME THAT MAYBE HE SHOWED IT TO THE DA, BUT MAYBE IT NEVER CAME UP. HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THAT I KNOW ABOUT IT. IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU AROUND HERE ANYMORE. THIS CAN'T BE RIGHT. IT'S HER SIGNATURE. I HAVE MY INVESTIGATOR TRACKING DOWN THE ATTORNEY WHO DRAFTED IT. SHE NEVER SAID ANYTHING. SHE NEVER EVEN SAID SHE WASN'T HAPPY. IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT CHERYL. JENNA MAYHEW TOLD ME SHE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR. WHAT? ARE YOU SURE? I'M SORRY. IT'S THE WAY IT LOOKS. HOW COULD I HAVE NOT KNOWN? I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU THAT THIS DOESN'T HELP OUR CASE, BUT I HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO PRESENT IT TO THE DA. YEAH, SURE. GO AHEAD. PRESENT IT TO HIM. SHE'S THE ONE WHO WAS IN THE PROCESS OF WRECKING OUR MARRIAGE AND I'M THE ONE WHO'S GOING TO PAY FOR IT. WE'LL PRESENT EVIDENCE TO THE JURY THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW. WHICH THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO BELIEVE. I NEED YOU TO HOLD IT TOGETHER. THAT'S ALL I'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE PAST SIX MONTHS. WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS. I'VE BEEN ALL THROUGH HER PHONE, EMAIL AND TEXT RECORDS. I DID FIND SOMETHING INTERESTING. INTERESTING SOUNDS LIKE AN IMPROVEMENT OVER THE REST OF MY DAY. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CALLS MADE TO THE EQUESTRIAN CENTER. YEAH, SHE RODE THERE ALL THE TIME. 10:00, 11:00 AT NIGHT? NOW THAT IS INTERESTING. THE LINE WAS SHARED WITH THE RIDING INSTRUCTOR'S RESIDENCE. APPARENTLY HE LIVES ON THE PROPERTY. YOU THINK THIS COULD BE OUR MYSTERY MAN? COULD BE. ALL RIGHT. I'M GOING TO CHECK IT OUT. LET ME KNOW IF YOU FIND ANYTHING ELSE. UH-HUH. * MUSIC * MUSIC * MUSIC [HORSES NEIGHING] [HORSES NEIGHING] [KNOCKING] ADRIAN? ADRIAN, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT CHERYL.

I'M GOING TO FIND YOU. [SIREN WAILING] YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE COME OUT HERE ON YOUR OWN. YOU TELL ME. IS HE WORTH YOUR OWN PERSONAL SAFETY? I'M A BIG GIRL, DAD. WHY ARE YOU EVEN HERE? CHERYL WAS CHEATING ON DAVID. WITH THE RIDING INSTRUCTOR? FRANK, I'VE SEARCHED THIS ENTIRE FACILITY. HE'S GONE. ALL RIGHT. WELL IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG DAY. YOU LISTEN TO ME. BE CAREFUL, ALL RIGHT? I WILL. SEE YOU LATER. WHERE'S YOUR CAR, OVER HERE? YEAH, IT'S RIGHT HERE. YEAH, IT'S RIGHT HERE. YEAH, IT'S RIGHT HERE. THE RIDING INSTRUCTOR'S NAME WAS ADRIAN ROMERO. TWO YEARS AGO HE WAS ACCUSED OF ASSAULTING A WOMAN AT AN EQUESTRIAN CENTER DOWN IN OHI. APPARENTLY HE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH THE WOMAN AND WHEN SHE TRIED TO END IT HE LOST HER TEMPER. SOUND FAMILIAR? WHAT HAPPENED? DROPPED THE CHARGES. THE VICTIM DIDN'T WANT TO GO THROUGH WITH THE TRIAL AND THERE WASN'T ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO HOLD ADRIAN. WOW. SO YOUR DAD IS LOOKING FOR HIM. MY FATHER SAID IT LOOKED LIKE HE SKIPPED TOWN. I'M SENDING THIS TO HIM RIGHT NOW. I'M SO SORRY. I SHOULD'VE NEVER ASKED YOU TO COME HERE. YOU NEEDED HELP. I KNOW, BUT YOU COULD'VE GOTTEN HURT. I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU. WHAT? I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME SOMEONE SAID THAT TO ME. PEOPLE CARE. I LIVE ALONE AND I SPEND MORE TIME WITH MURDERERS AND THIEVES THAN I DO WITH FRIENDS OR FAMILY. NOT TRUE. YOU'RE JUST NOT AROUND TO SEE IT. WHY DID YOU LEAVE? AFTER MY MOM GOT SICK I DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL, CAME BACK TO TAKE CARE OF HER. WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT HAPPENED? SHE SAID IT WOULD BE THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE, THAT SHE WOULD NEVER FORGIVE ME. I NEVER MEANT IT TO BE HARD ON ANYONE. MY DAD WAS SO ANGRY THAT I LEFT. WE HAD THIS HUGE FIGHT AND THAT WAS IT. IT DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T HAVE MY REGRETS. IT DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T HAVE MY REGRETS. SOMEBODY'S OUT THERE. IT COULD BE HIM. DAVID. WHERE IS HE? HUH?! WHERE ARE YOU? WHY DON'T YOU COME OUT AND SHOW YOURSELF LIKE A REAL MAN?!!!! YOU LEAVE HER ALONE, YOU HEAR ME? DAVID, DAVID... YOUR BRACELET. STOP. YEAH, HE THINKS HE'S ABOVE THE LAW. WELL HE'S WRONG. COME ON. LET'S GO INSIDE. COME ON. LET'S GO INSIDE. * MUSIC * MUSIC * MUSIC IN CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE THEY CAME FROM? LOOK AT THIS. THE TREAD, SIZE OF THE TIRE. THESE ARE CUSTOM TIRES, VERY HIGH END. I KNOW A GUY BACK DOWN IN THE CITY WHO DEALS IN AFTER MARKET MODIFICATIONS. I WANT TO MAKE A CAST OF THESE AND SHOW HIM. I HAVE A STRONG HUNCH WHO'S GOING TO TURN UP. IT'S ONLY GOING TO TAKE A COUPLE OF HOURS. I NEED YOU TO WORRY ABOUT OUR KILLER FIRST. AND WHAT IF HE'S DANGEROUS? AND WHAT IF YOU'RE WRONG AND THAT'S THE KILLER? THEN WE'VE GOT HIM EITHER WAY. DON'T WORRY. THIS CITY GIRL CAN TAKE CARE OF HERSELF. [CELL PHONE RINGING] HELLO? GREAT. ARE YOU COMING HERE? OKAY. WE'LL BE READY. GOOD NEWS. THAT WAS DR. STEVENSON. HE'S FINISHED WITH HIS TESTS. THERE ARE SEVERAL SETS OF PRINTS ON THE HANDLE OF THE KNIFE. THE CLEAREST ARE A PERFECT MATCH FOR DAVID'S. OF COURSE MY PRINTS ARE ON THE KNIFE. I COOK. I USE THE KNIFE ALL THE TIME. HOWEVER, SEVERAL OF THE PRINTS HAVE BEEN COMPROMISED. COMPROMISED? SMUDGED. SOMEBODY ELSE HANDLED THE KNIFE AFTER DAVID'S PRINTS WERE TRANSFERRED. EXACTLY. I STRONGLY SUSPECT THE PERSON WAS WEARING GLOVES. OF COURSE, THIS IS NOT DISPROVING DAVID'S INVOLVEMENT. BUT IT GOES TO REASONABLE DOUBT. HAS YOUR FATHER HAD ANY SUCCESS FINDING ADRIAN? NOT YET. HAVE YOU TRACKED DOWN THE LAWYER THAT DRAFTED THE DIVORCE PAPERS? HIS NAME IS DAN MOORE. I'VE LEFT HIM TWO MESSAGES, BUT FROM THE LOOK OF THINGS SHE DECIDED NOT TO GO THROUGH WITH IT. ACCORDING TO JENNA MAYHEW SHE WAS GOING TO BREAK IT OFF WITH ADRIAN. MAYBE SHE WAS GOING TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER CHANCE. SOUNDS LIKE A MOTIVE FOR ADRIAN. JEALOUS LOVER WHO GETS HIS REVENGE. I COULD SUBPOENA JENNA MAYHEW TO COMPEL TESTIMONY THAT CHERYL WAS HAVING AN EXTRAMARITAL AFFAIR WITH ADRIAN. THAT PLUS HIS RECORD SHOULD BE ENOUGH. I CAN CALL DOWN TO OHI. MAYBE HIS DNA IS IN THEIR DATABASE. AND I'LL TRY THE LAWYER AGAIN. AND I'LL LOOK INTO THOSE TIRES AND GET THE INFORMATION TO YOUR FATHER, AFTER I'M DONE WITH THE LAWYER. I PROMISE. CASE COMES FIRST. THANK YOU, LANCE. I SHOULD GET GOING. I'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO BEFORE TOMORROW. NO, NO, NO. I DON'T FEEL SAFE WITH YOU BEING OUT THERE ALONE. WHY DON'T YOU STAY HERE WITH ME? WHAT HAPPENED LAST WAS A MISTAKE. KATE. YOU'RE MY CLIENT. I'M MORE THAN THAT AND YOU KNOW IT. GET PLENTY OF REST. YOU'RE GOING TO NEED IT FOR TOMORROW. YOU'RE GOING TO NEED IT FOR TOMORROW. YOU'RE GOING TO NEED IT FOR TOMORROW. [CELL PHONE RINGING] HEY. THANKS FOR CALLING ME BACK. I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY. A FEW WEEKS AT LEAST. YEAH, I DON'T KNOW. A FAMILY SITUATION HAS COME UP. OKAY. WELL, I'LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN I KNOW MORE. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME? DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT'S BEEN FOR ME SINCE WHAT HAPPENED IN OHI? HOW HARD IT'S BEEN TO FIND A NEW JOB, A NEW HOME? YOU ASSAULTED THAT WOMAN. SHUT UP! THAT WAS A MISTAKE. I NEVER MEANT TO HURT THAT WOMAN. THAT'S WHAT I TOLD THE COPS. THAT'S WHY THEY DROPPED THE CHARGES. THEY DROPPED THE CHARGES BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO CONVICT YOU. I ASSURE YOU THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? AN INNOCENT MAN IS GOING TO JAIL BECAUSE OF SOMETHING YOU DID. WAIT. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CHERYL. I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HER MURDER. WE HAVE PHONE RECORDS. CHERYL CALLING THE EQUESTRIAN CENTER, YOUR COTTAGE. I KNOW ABOUT THE AFFAIR. FIRST OF ALL, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO THAT LINE. AT 11:00 AT NIGHT? I WASN'T HAVING AN AFFAIR. HOW DID IT FEEL WHEN SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING TO BREAK IT OFF WITH YOU, WHEN SHE WAS GOING TO CHOOSE HER HUSBAND OVER YOU? YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW, WHEN THEY'RE DONE WITH YOU YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO LEAVE. I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING! FREEZE, ROMERO! HANDS WHERE WE CAN SEE THEM!!! YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH. I'M FINE. COME ON. LET'S GO. COME ON. LET'S GO. PHONE RECORDS INDICATE THAT ADRIAN ROMERO WAS HAVING A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE VICTIM FIVE MONTHS PRIOR TO HER MURDER. WE HAVE SWORN TESTIMONY BY JENNA MAYHEW SAYING THAT CHERYL HAD GONE TO A LAWYER SEEKING A DIVORCE, WHICH WE CAN PROVE WITH THE ACTUAL PETITION. I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT. ACCORDING TO MISS MAYHEW, CHERYL DECIDED NOT GO THROUGH WITH IT BECAUSE OF THE BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HER FATHER AND HUSBAND. HMM. DID YOU CONFIRM THIS WITH HER DIVORCE ATTORNEY? WE HAVE NOT LOCATED HIM YET, BUT WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT HIS TESTIMONY WILL MATCH MISS MAYHEW'S. WE CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT THIS DECISION ENRAGED HER LOVER MR. ROMERO. WHAT EVIDENCE DO YOU HAVE ON MR. ROMERO? WE HAVE A DETAILED REPORT OF ACCUSATIONS MADE AT HIS PAST PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT, AS WELL AS AN ARREST REPORT FROM LAST NIGHT WHERE HE WAS ARRESTED FOR ASSAULTING ME; A CLEAR INSIGHT INTO HIS AGGRESSIVE AND VIOLENT NATURE. THANK YOU. AND WHAT WOULD BE THE MOTIVE FOR HIM COMING AFTER YOU, COUNSELLOR? APPARENTLY HE WASN'T TOO APPRECIATIVE OF ME DIGGING INTO HIS PAST OR HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE VICTIM. DID HE CONFESS TO THE MURDER? NO, YOUR HONOR, BUT THE INTENT WAS CLEAR. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD? IN LIGHT OF WHAT'S HAPPENED, WE HAVE NO REASON TO KEEP MR. WALKER DETAINED, PENDING FURTHER INVESTIGATION. MR. WALKER, I'M ORDERING A STAY IN THIS CASE. YOU ARE FREE TO GO FOR THE TIME BEING, BUT PLEASED BE ADVISED THAT THAT IS ONLY UNTIL A PROPER INVESTIGATION INTO MR. ROMERO'S INVOLVEMENT HAS BEEN CONDUCTED. COURT ADJOURNED. YOU DID IT. TAKE THIS MAN INTO CUSTODY. ON WHAT CHARGE? STALKING, HARASSMENT AND MAKING THREATS. THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS. THE TIRES MATCH THE TREADS WE FOUND AT THE SCENE. WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO? YOU THOUGH HE KILLED CHERYL AND SHE WAS TRYING TO GET HIM OFF. I THOUGHT IT WAS WHAT YOU WANTED. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT. ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU IN A COURT OF LAW. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE AN ATTORNEY PRESENT DURING QUESTIONING. IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD AN ATTORNEY, ONE WILL BE APPOINTED TO YOU. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THESE RIGHTS? COME ON, FRANK? WHAT ARE YOU DOING ARRESTING, KENNETH? HASN'T OUR FAMILY SUFFERED ENOUGH? ROY, YOUR SON HAS BEEN STALKING MY DAUGHTER EVER SINCE SHE CAME TO TOWN. HE TRIED TO RUN HER OFF THE ROAD AND HE THREW A BRICK THROUGH MY WINDOW AND NEARLY HIT MY GRANDDAUGHTER. THIS HAS GOT TO STOP. ENOUGH. OKAY. I UNDERSTAND. I HEARD WHAT HAPPENED. I WAS JUST SICK TO MY STOMACH. I'M FINE. SO, ARE YOU HEADING BACK TO SAN FRANCISCO SOON? I'M NOT SURE. I LIKE THE WAY THAT SOUNDS. I LIKE THE WAY THAT SOUNDS. WOW. YOU REALLY DO KNOW HOW TO COOK. I DO HAVE SOME TALENTS. I THOUGHT YOU SAID WE COULDN'T GO BACK TO THE WAY THINGS WERE. IT DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T TRY. IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN HELP YOU WITH? NO. YOU ALL READY SAVED MY LIFE. I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY. THIS WILL BE READY IN ABOUT 15 MINUTES. I COULD MAKE A SALAD. NO. GET OUT OF MY KITCHEN. OKAY. GO ON. YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE COOKS. I GET IT. I'LL KEEP MYSELF BUSY. YOU CAN DO DESSERT. WE'LL SEE. [CELL PHONE RINGING] HI, LANCE. KATE, I FINALLY GOT A CALL FROM THE DIVORCE LAWYER. OH, YOU DIDN'T GET MY MESSAGE? THEY ARRESTED ROMERO AND DROPPED THE CHARGES AGAINST DAVID. KATE, CHERYL WAS NOT THE ONE HAVING AN AFFAIR. WHAT? SHE WANTED TO DIVORCE DAVID BECAUSE HE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR. ARE YOU SURE? YES. YOU'RE SURE? MAYBE THE LAWYER JUST HAD IT BACKWARDS. I ASKED HIM TO DOUBLE-CHECK HIS NOTES. HE AND CHERYL HAD SEVERAL MEETINGS ABOUT IT. SHE WANTED A DIVORCE BECAUSE HER HUSBAND, IN HER OWN WORDS, HAD BEEN UNFAITHFUL DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR MARRIAGE. ALL THIS TIME. KATE. I'M SORRY. I HAVE TO GO. I ALL READY CALLED YOUR FATHER. HE'S ON HIS WAY. I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER. JEN, I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW. JEN, I CAN'T. I'M GOING TO CALL YOU LATER, OKAY? OKAY. I LOVE YOU. OKAY. OKAY. I LOVE YOU. OKAY, BYE, BYE. HEY. IS EVERYTHING OKAY? JEN? OH, THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK. YOU TOLD ME YOU DIDN'T KNOW JENNA. YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU GUYS DIDN'T GET ALONG. THE FOOD'S GOING TO GET COLD. COME ON. IT WASN'T CHERYL HAVING THE AFFAIR. IT WAS YOU. YOU LET JENNA IMPLICATE ADRIAN. YOU KNEW ABOUT HIS PAST AND YOU SET HIM UP. KATE, IT'S OVER, OKAY. JUST LET IT GO. DID SHE HAVE ANY IDEA? DID SHE HAVE ANY IDEA THAT YOU WERE CHEATING ON HER WITH HER OWN BEST FRIEND? IT'S COMPLICATED. NOT AT ALL. YOU NEEDED CHERYL OUT OF THE WAY SO THAT YOU COULD BE WITH JENNA, BUT YOU COULDN'T DIVORCE HER BECAUSE YOU WOULD GET NOTHING IN THE PRENUP. SO THEN THAT LEFT YOU WITH ONE OTHER OPTION. THAT'S RIDICULOUS. YOU KILLED HER. JUST CALM DOWN, OKAY, BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING PARANOID. AND THEN YOU CALL ME, YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND, TO COME AND DEFEND YOU, ALL THIS TIME USING ME TO SET SOMEONE ELSE UP FOR THE CRIME. THE LATE NIGHT PHONE CALLS FROM THE EQUESTRIAN CENTER. THAT WAS JENNA CALLING YOU. DO YOU HEAR YOURSELF? DO YOU HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING RIGHT NOW? IT'S CRAZY. * MUSIC * MUSIC * MUSIC [SIREN WAILING] [SIREN WAILING] GET OFF ME. GET OFF ME! YOU KILLED HER. SORRY. IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. IT'S KATE. LET HER GO! YOU HAVE TO THE COUNT OF ONE! MOVE! GET UP. ON YOUR FEET. YOUR FRIEND LANCE TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED. YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH, I'M FINE. JENNA MAYHEW. I'LL SEND SOMEONE DOWN TO PICK HER UP. OKAY. COME ON. OKAY. COME ON. HOW COULD I HAVE BEEN SO WRONG? WE'RE ALL WRONG SOMETIMES, SOME OF US MORE THAN OTHERS. DAD. I KNOW I HAVEN'T EXACTLY MADE YOU FEEL WELCOME HERE, BUT IF YOU WANT YOU COULD STAY WITH ME FOR A WHILE AT THE HOUSE. I'M SURE BETH WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU AROUND. WHAT DO YOU SAY? I'D LIKE THAT. LET'S GO HOME. UGH. YOU'RE ALL WET. COME ON.
