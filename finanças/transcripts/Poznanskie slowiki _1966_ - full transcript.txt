Doesn't matter, i have an idea -Me too Do you have money? -I do Dad's become generous and so has mum So how much do you have? - So which ones should we take? Those for 3 zloty are most economical there is less of it in those for 5 zl. Agreed. Take two of them for 3 zl. I'll take from that blond chick are you crazy? You've bought three of them? She did not have a change. That's good. the third one i take for my mum. Hey, what do you think? would happen if the teacher would see us? He would start preaching... The throat is a very delicate instrument... And voice cords are not made from steal . That's why the temperature of liquids is so important and ice creams are especially treacherous You really think that ice creams are treacherous? Those grown ups always think of something to deny us a pleasure. If you say that there is something better than ice creams then i give you a punch. What are you looking at? Listen, i forgot about the percussion lesson.. I need to go. Would you (??) be kind enough to have a look? What did you (??) bring? That's horrible Perhaps this? -That's even worse! There is nothing worth looking at Not even these ? -Thank you. We've chosen the best we had. There wasn't anything else in the store Please, live it all here and go. -Yes, madam O, dear! I completely forgot about you I would just want to try one more thing... That is for you and this for you Kristin Well... yes... That is your color Kristine... OK, I think that would be good.. Thank you... you can get dressed .Do you think i could ask her? I'm not sure... She does not seem to be in a good mood Looks very tired... But we always used to take dresses before the show -Looks like you have a date? At what time? -He will be waiting for me after work -Good looking? -So, so.... I hope he is not old? -Around 40 but he looks younger Married? - no idea...possible.. No!!!! ?? ??! -Big deal!

I beg you, calm down To start with... explain who is the person in question? Do i have to? Right now? -?? As if it is not enough that i am running from factory to factory and meetings ... Before you were just as busy but we managed to be always together Do you want a divorce? you're welcome! But do not forget that we have a son! My dear! As far as Paul is concern -I will definitely take him with me! Don't even think of it! He will stay with me! Are You fighting again? They ran out of "Grunvalds" so i bought "Vavel"(???????? ???????)

Were you recording? -Yes, practicing So how are things? - In school? There was no school. We went on an excursion No, i meant choir.. I think OK, the teacher said that.... -Boys! what would you like to eat? Lots of meat and salad And for you Paul? -Anything And a lot of coffee. I/ll be up the whole night. Why is that?

It was true until yesterday We've received completely new type of engines and i have to learn everything about them Do you think you 'll manage? I will not study unless i get a juicy stake and a salad. Me too! I want a big juicy stake and salad Should we eat the salad or hide it? Firstly, we eat it and then hide it. -OK.

We are going to sing in the museum -In the museum? -No body ever seen you there.. - But we were there just the other day Really? You are mistaken. I have not been there for two years now. "sleep my little son, sleep" "have a dream of happiness " Close your little eyes I'll seat here, close to you The planet Earth already sleeps Little children dream.. That on the planet is a paradise Given to us So dream baby(child) , dream ( keep dreaming) Give it to me.
