Marianita de Jesus is considered the author of the famous maxim which anticipates that "Ecuador will not disappear due to earthquakes but due to bad governments" But that's absurd because in those days Ecuador didn't exist as a country yet What people did say about governments in those days was: "Long live the King of Spain! Down with corrupted governments!" More or less the same as we say nowadays: "Long live democracy! Down with the president!" María Teresa Hernández Larrea.

Latitude: Zero Why are we stopping? Don't know looks like there's a caravan I'm sorry ma'am; do you know why we're not moving?

So why do you have to get to Cuenca today? Because a friend of mine is getting married Oh, great! Hey, do you know why the roads have been blocked? I thought it was because the gas prices went up but on the radio they said it had to do with Plan Colombia - Plan Colombia? - That's what they said the radicals who are against it have staged a protest in order to paralyze everything until the people who came to sign the Plan Colombia leave the country - How strange - Yep First time I hear about it too but nowadays people block the roads for any reason, so What's going on? Are there problems in Colombia? Yeah man, but from way back Yeah, yeah but What's going on now? Look: The thing is that these days they were going to sign an agreement that allows the gringos to access our frontiers more easily And are there so many people against that? Sure 'cause those guys are using the drug problem as a smoke curtain to set up camp here The Colombians? No, the Colombians would be ok the gringos And are you for it or against it? Against what? Well the plan, the strike, the gringos I don't know I'm against it Ok, but against what? The plan, the strike, the gringos, everything, I'm against everything actually I saw a movie once, where people were trapped in a bus station in the middle of nowhere and they couldn't get out Your country is so beautiful When I return I want to go to Otavalo I'm really thrilled with that market full of colours, you know Indigenous people are so cool!

Because he's my boyfriend, I mean he was, I don't know anymore But I can't let him get married He himself doesn't want to, and he's being forced to it Wow! You don't seem to fit the part stopping a wedding inside a church That sounds more like me But I'm going for it Do you want a tissue? Yes, thanks Is Alausí still very far? I don't think so It's so weird - What is? - To be here It happens sometimes while I'm traveling you know? I suddenly feel my mind goes blank and I don't know who I am or what I'm doing so far away from home That's weird With your travel guide and your camera one would say you never get lost No way I use the guide to avoid panicking you know? When I'm lost I open it and follow the instructions Gee that's tough Look Do you have a daughter? No, it's me Oh how pretty I carry it with me all the time My mum says I used to be a very happy child And who's that? Hi, I'm Jesus Oh my God! What are you doing in this paramo?

But this time I've had bad luck I couldn't even record the Chimborahua 'cause it was cloudy The Chimborazo, not Chimborahua If you call it Chimborahua, it's never going' to show up that mate likes to hide away from foreigners You don't mean that I'm serious; Chimborazo never shows himself to foreigners Let's see, Alausi 16 It says here that there's an ancient train station here in Alausí We could go visit the station while we wait for a car Don't you think so? It's breathtaking to think they could build a railway on these mountains a hundred years ago You guys are so much fun It's great to be on tour with you both Welll'm not actually touring with you girls and the only thing that takes my breath right now is to get to Cuenca on time for my grandmother's funeral - I'm sorry, is that why you're going? - Yep But your family will understand that with the strike you weren't able to make it on time, right? The problem isn't whether I get there on time but whether grandma does Ah, my granny She was from Cuenca but she lived in Quito and her last wish was that I, her eldest grandchild took her back to Cuenca or rather her ashes To spread them out in the Tomebamba River But since she was afraid of planes she asked to be taken by land So here I am What breath taken? Anyway What we should do is look for tortillas or something to eat 'cause we still got a long way to go Morning! What can I get for you sir? Good morning ma'am give us three cold sodas and a treat of tortillas please And a switch for the camera, if possible What is she going to tape today? People come out on Sundays, right now it will look all abandoned Excuse me ma'am have you heard anything about the strike on the news? No, I haven't Do you know when the roads will be open? Haven't they said anything on TV? There's no news at this hour Sir, there's a switch next to the door that you can use Thank you ma'am Please ma'am, can you switch the TV on there might be some information There's nothing at this time But strikes usually last one whole day They missed so many goals With love, to all my fellow Ecuadorian people Look, my favorite serial is already on LOVE LIES So what's your hurry? A relative of yours is ill or something? No way my story isn't worth telling Well I don't think so I find it very heavy What is it? It's just that a friend of mine is getting married tomorrow Matricide! In Cuenca that's sacred same as funerals, especially if they're your friends' Tell him, come on, maybe he can give you some advice The thing is I don't want to go to his wedding I actually want to stop it Well, that sounds interesting The thing is this guy isn't in love with his girlfriend I mean, with the girl he's marrying But he's marrying her anyway because she's pregnant And how do you know that? What? That she's pregnant? No, how do you know he doesn't want to marry her? Ahwell I don't know maybe he does but they're not at all alike Look: He's a biologist, a hitchhiker, he's got long hair he's the black sheep of his stuck up family and she's the typical Cuencano girl: Green eyes, works in a bank, goes to church and paints her nails while she waits for her husband to appear So he's more your type you mean Kind of And you've been dating him Yeah but not really dating 'cause I don't live in Cuenca Ok, but you're in love with him and you think he should marry you instead Marry me? No way What I think is he shouldn't be marrying anyone - That sure sounds strange - I think so too I'm sick of your lies I'm sick of your lies Ma'am can you give us three more sodas please Valentina, you couldn't deal with the truth But as a proof of love, Victor Manuel, I need to know who I've been married to all these years! But... What is it you really want with this guy? I want to be with him, but without compromising go out with him, travel with him be with him Shag with him? Yeah that too but that's not the issue Well, well You guys don't get it I'm sorry but I think it's you who doesn't get it You're in love with this guy like a teenager and you don't seem to realize it You don't take a trip like this just to chit-chat with a friend do you? So what are you planning to do to stop the wedding? First of all I'd like to talk to him face-to-face 'cause his parents, his brothers and all his relatives seem to have trapped the poor guy Even the in laws must be involved by now. I know how this works He must be virtually kidnapped by the family without realizing it He's about to confess everything! But I lied to you Valentina When you and I first met, I was in love with Sonia María When you and I got married I kept on loving that woman Two years ago, when her husband died I... Enough, enough, say no more, you're killing me! Shit, I left the camera switched on! Let's see First of all I'd like to talk to him face-to-face 'cause his parents, his brothers and all his relatives seem to have trapped the poor guy Even the in laws must be involved by now Ecuador ah? - You should put this house on tape - Which one? This one, Eloy Alfaro slept here the night before he was killed And who was that? That is one of the few decent military this country has had in fact, he was the first one to come up with the idea that this could be a country and not a bunch of haciendas ruled by priests The man built the railway to unify the Coast with the Highlands and they used this same railway to take him from Guayaquil to Quito to kill him - Hi where are you heading? - To Zhud - Is that near Cuenca? - It's on the way - Would you mind taking her? - Ok I'll tell her then He says he's going to Zhud Maybe I could go on ahead Sure, you do that Gee, it's too bad And you guys? And your grandma? Don't worry about my grandma, she hated motorcycles anyway Sure, go Ok bye Ready? You know Jesus my father wanted to be incinerated but when he died we buried him My mum wanted to have him near her, you know? And she said it was hard for her to convert him in ashes from one day to another No way you have to let people leave spreading away the ashes is a way of saying goodbye Because "freedom, Sancho, is the most precious gift men have received from the heavens"! Wait up; I'll have a heart attack if I'm left alone with this horse in the middle of nowhere Calm down! You're not in the middle of nowhere and as long as windmills don't show up, it's cool! Thanks a lot How much do I owe you? That's alright let me buy you a beer instead And I can help you find a place to stay in case you have to Thanks but I have to move on no matter how You've got someone waiting for you in Cuenca for sure Not really, but What, you're afraid of Ecuadorians or something?

Like everywhere else I guess And this friend of yours - What's his name? - The Puppy? We've called him Puppy since he was a kid His dad and uncles are best known as Dogs, so he's the Puppy - Ok, but your friend - He's finally going to settle down He's almost thirty already And who's the bride? His everlasting girlfriend: Blondie Crespo nice girl, beautiful girl indeed! He was so cool my friend I mean, he still is cool loves to party, enjoys life Blondie has been really patient with him, He spent most of his time at the beach He had the perfect alibi with marine biology So he's had a great life ah? That's for sure; the Puppy really knew how to enjoy life But Blondie gave him the ultimatum And you know how those things are in Cuenca mate I sure do That's why I don't want to get to Cuenca without his special gift It's going to be the Puppy's last joy No more beach, no more surf, no more hippy girlfriends 'cause he was a real lady's man handsome and charming as he was didn't loose a chance But now it's pay back time He'll have to uphold the baby take over the family business Now I want to see him when he has to put pesticides on the flower plantations, let's see how Mr Ecologist handles that But that's what we all have to go through some day, right? - If you say so - That's the way it is mate! Cheers! To all the Puppies that'll grow to be Dogs someday! Cheers! Another two beers ma'm! Seems like we're staying a bit longer here! You're great mates! I really like you people Cheers! Take it easy, it could be someone else What do you mean someone else? It's him Don't you see everything fits? Ok but did you know they called him Puppy? No I met him at the beach, not in Cuenca and he was on his own, not with that bunch of shitty relatives and friends he's got Here So I was just another hippy girlfriend of his! And he had a girlfriend waiting for him in Cuenca and haciendas and flower plantations The so called ecologist! Stop it girl, that's what this guy says But the real truth we don't know The real truth? It's pretty clear to me The bastard was only waiting to turn thirty to become a conservative just like his father marry a blondie just like his mother and bring up spoilt little kids just like himself! Wait up Sadness! You're merely repeating what this guy said But things might be different I remember you saying the family had kidnapped the poor guy Maybe he's just never met a girl as daring as you are maybe he doesn't even know that people like you exist! I mean when he sees you actually turn up there he'll realize life can be really different I don't believe a word you're saying But you're right In these things, once you get started, you have to go all the way Let's go What have I said, for God's sake! Ok mates, if you insist in getting to Cuenca today, you must stay here if not to the beach with me! What are we going to do? I don't know about you guys, but I'm staying here until someone picks me up Why would you stay here, this place's deserted! I'm staying anyway man, you guys keep going In any case let's grab some fruit, bananas, tangerines or something Sure, come on Hey Puppy! How are you mate? I'm on the Coast now man So what was your friends' name? Iguana? You're kidding me Puppy! You get me into so much trouble you bastard! Hey Puppy! And how was your farewell party? Wow! Great man! Sure I know the place I went there with you once! And how good were the chicks? Really? You're really hot man! Sure, that chick's gorgeous! Maria was there too? Really? You're the best, man! Blondie doesn't suspect a thing, right? Be careful mate Hey guys, I think I'm coming to the beach too - This place is deserted anyway - Sure, come on! I saw a movie once where a group of friends go on a trip to see a lake but when they get there it's so foggy that they can't see a thing But they stay there anyhow watching the void Although I prefer movies where people kill, take drugs, sleep around, do something, know what I mean? Sleeping around is ok with me Taking drugs I'd be willing to I'm not sure about the killing part though Look, if you wanted sex, drugs and fun, you should've gone with that guy! Hey, I didn't want to go all by myself, you know? And you could've been a little nicer The guy gave us a lift, he offered to take us to Cuenca he even wanted to buy us ceviches What else did you want girl? Look, the guy saw you were a foreigner and thought "hum, this chick" This chick what? The guy never came near me! Of course he didn't 'cause he didn't have the time But his invitation to drink beers on the beach was so obvious Might have been obvious for you 'cause if it had been obvious for me I'd have gone with him straight away - See? - I'm kidding girl! But I'm grown up enough to know what I want or don't want with a guy, right? But you make it sound like the wolf running after red riding hood the guy wants to eat up the foreigner the rich kid wants to have his chance with the little girls But what if I were the wolf? If I were given the chance to choose, I'd choose being the wolf and not red riding hood, who thinks shagging, is not an issue in life Here you go It's good eh Seems like the strike is over! The president quit they say - What do you mean the president quit? - Well, they made him quit actually Shit, look at me here! Completely unaware of what's going on out there! Relax there's not much going on really The fellow army principals kindly suggested the president to abandon the Presidential Palace It's amazing how quickly you people get rid of presidents here! With the same quickness they turn into presidents 'cause they're no real presidents, you know? Yeah, but Ah, this is Jesus And this is Francisco mate, but you can call me by my nickname: Iguana This is ridiculous, the country's falling apart and here we are, drinking cocktails, - with Iguana - Stop torturing yourself girl! If I were in Quito, at least I'd have the chance to go out to the streets to demonstrate or something! Demonstrate what? This morning you didn't know what was going on! I didn't know what was going on but I sure have things I want to demonstrate and shout, you know? Looks like you've had quite a few drinks here already Lady's Night mate What can I get you? Whatever they're drinking I guess Tell me, Jesus, why do they all kiss my feet? Lts Saint Peter, here, sitting in a bronze cast I cannot look aside nor give a kick because my feet are worn out, as you see make a miracle, My Lord! Let me go down to the river and be a fisherman again That's me! - Bravo, bravo! - Cool mate! - That's great - Another one! Come on! No, that's enough! Where are you going Jesus? I'll be with granny for a while, you guys stay here nice and quiet Do you mind if I take pictures of you? - These are My friends from Ecuador! - Wait a second there! What would you like? The Unicef Christmas postcard? With the smiling white, black and blue kids? Or would you prefer the National Geographic one with the savage man chewing his coconut What's wrong with you guys! I just wanted to have a souvenir from you Souvenirs are kept in here Otherwise you'll turn into one of those cable channel explorers who go on adventures but never get dirty Nor step on shit! Well guys, I might be a cable channel explorer but in your country, like in any other, there's tons of things to see and do So I'm not going to search out for shit! If I wanted to do that I'd have stayed in my own country Ho ho don't compare my country with yours! Why not? Both are shitty anyway! Excuse me girls, but this here would be like a different shit a unique one Right! And that's why, since the Pizarros, those ancestors of yours, arrived here all sort of pirates have kept on coming from all over the world My ancestors? You mean your ancestors, 'cause mine stayed back in Spain - in Extremadura, Sevilla and Valencia! - You've got a point there But only half a point actually 'cause your ancestors are my ancestors' ancestors, right? Enough is enough! We're not having a foolish ancestor contest here right? No, the problem here aren't the ancestors, but the present-cestors that turn into presidents, bankers, flowerers, banana-ers, whatever just to be able to grab the last bit of shit there's left But they won't make it - 'cause our shit is never-ending! - This country isn't pretty This country is cool! Look: Pretty is not worth it pretty is disgusting We're not like canned food nor Campbell Soups nor Nordic countries where they're white, pure and narrow shitted Here we're neither white, nor pure nor narrow shitted Those who say we're indians are not always indians Those who say we're not Indians, sometimes turn out to be just that Those who aren't black sometimes wish they were And those of us who are half this, half that and half whatever never know what to say when they ask us what we are But we're gutsy people! Gutsy! What's that? Cool, gutsy is like cool Only some of us though,'cause there are also some cowards, like Daniel's father who forces his son to get married to this girl only because of her name Something else is bothering you, girl Hey stop it! What a headache! Shit! Sadness!! Sadness wake up! Wake up! What's the matter? Our stuff's being dragged by the sea girl, com on! - Where's Iguana? - I don't know where he is girl! I'm telling you our stuff's missing! Jesus, come on, wake up man! Cool guys, cool! Take whatever you want but be cool Sadness! - Jesus - Jesus Granny took a short cut after all She was going to end up at sea anyhow Well if you look at it that way She was always on the go I wonder why I never get a happy ending story of my own It all depends with happy endings, you know What do you mean? Yeah, it all depends on where you decide to make the story end Look, if you'd decided to end this story the day you met Daniel at the beach there you had your happy ending final credits, music, applauses and everybody went home happy But now this guy got married to this blondie that means children and haciendas for him and that's were his story ends but your story hasn't ended yet I actually think it has just begun Santa Ana de los Ríos de Cuenca Registered in the Book of Councils as founded on April 12th 1557 granted by the statement of Andres Hurtado de Mendoza, Peruvian Vice-King of those days Ancestries: Cañari, Inca and Spanish Its previous names were: Tumipamba and Guapondelig Most recent surgical extractions: Removal of a significant part of its population due to massive unemployment emigration Hey, miss, wake up; we're closing the bus now Ah? What's going on? And Jesus? - The guy with the beard? - Yes, that one That guy got off before we reached the terminal Did he? Where? - Up town he did - Didn't he leave a message or something? No, but he forgot something on his seat, wait here - Gee, this guy - Oh brother - Is he a relative of yours? - No, he's our friend See? Well, weddings are all alike actually Can you imagine me there? My hair all made up, dancing with my in-laws, my feet all swollen, and having to smile on top of all so everybody thinks I'm happy Well, happiness, you know This time I really want to get drunk! If they tell you: We saw him all smashed Her not him Why do you say him if you're her! Sadness, stop correcting me all the time! We're just singing right now, aren't we? Let me have another drink What's wrong now? - It's that I'm not Sadness - What do you mean? Just that: My name is not Sadness And why would you lie to me on something like that? Do you think Jesus is Jesus' real name? - It's so weird - What is? - Being here - Hey, that's my bit, isn't it? Tomebamba River Fluvial Current that is born in the Highlands of Cajas and abandoning its name descends through the Eastern Andes Mountains to be successively named Paute, Namangoza, Santiago and Amazonas I'm sorry but, you're in my seat Her grandpa's books unlocked the doors of a different world for her Sadness!!! My name's Hope and you are?
