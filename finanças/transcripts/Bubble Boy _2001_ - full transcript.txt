Hi. My name's Jimmy Livingston. My mom says when I was born, I came gift-wrapped from heaven. Aaah! Whoa! Whoa! Huh. Well, I guess this is growing up My first memories are kind of hazy. All I remember is a place with white walls, bright lights, and a gigantic bird. I was there because I was born with no immunities. A single germ could kill me. But when I was 4, my mom took me home... To beautiful Palmdale, California. Mom helped me make friends right away. Let's go. Get him in! Our house was enormous like a castle, and for the first time, I felt completely free. There. Now you're safe from that evil, filthy world. You're home, Jimmy! And you'll never, ever, ever have to go out there again. Look at that. Look what mommy made for Jimmy. I had a big room with my own bed, lots of toys, and two pairs of retractable arms. "And the prince climbed "to the top of the tower and said, 'come with me and we'll live happily ever after.' "then Rapunzel left her plastic bubble and died." The end. Those evil doctors. Nobody's gonna get any germs on my little boy now. You'll always stay pure. Won't you, Jimmy? Jimmy! Breakfastie! I had my reading. I wish they had more than one magazine in the world, mom. So do I, dear. My favorite TV show, Land of the Lost. I wish TVs had more than one channel, mom. So do I, dear. And I had the best teacher in the whole, wide world. And then the Indians decided to move to the reservations where they could open casinos and sell tax-free cigarettes and stay out of the white man's way. Another A+. The neighborhood kids always wanted to hang at my house. Lives in a bubble, smells like poop Bubble boy, bubble boy Get out of here, you little buggers! Go on! But I liked to hang with my dad. Oh, mother of shit, Morton! Are you trying to kill him with that thing? Jimmy, lunchie. Suppertime was the best. Nothing could beat mom's homemade, vitamin-rich, soy-based, germ-free, fat-free fiber cookies. Mmm. Mm-hmm. I grew up like any other kid. At 16, I didn't get a car, but I did get an electrical rock-music guitar! I can't believe the things I found I need to find my way I'm lost, I'm lost I do believe I'm living in the Land of the Lost I'm living in the Land living in the Land Living in the Land of the Lost I was so happy. I had everything a boy could ever want. Until... Chloe. "And then Pinocchio "came out of his plastic bubble, "touched the filthy little whore next door, and died. The end." Ooh, baby Ahh Oh, yeah Over the next few years, I washed my window a lot. Ahh Oh, my Something was happening to me. But I didn't know what. Mom! What's the matter? Mom! Are you all right? What is it? Oh! Oh, my God! Ow! Don't touch it! Hands off! Now, just relax, don't get upset. It hurts! Just do what I tell your father... just say the Pledge of Allegiance over and over until it goes away. Come on! I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America... And to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America... And to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God... Thanks, mom. Can't touch this can't touch this... Dude! You live next door to the bubble boy. Hey, you know what I heard? The only thing that kid can drink is his own urine. Oh, yeah. True story. I heard the same thing, man. It's gross. Then what did he drink in the first place to make the urine? Well, it would, um... Tell her. Shotgun! He's not a monster, you guys. He's just a boy in a bubble. I am not a monster. I'm a human being. Bye, Lisa. Bye, Chloe. I wish I was the boy in her bubble. Oh, yeah! Let's hit the arcade. Hi, Mr. Livingston? I'm Chloe. I live... next door. Hyah! Oh, my gosh! What? Are you okay? What?

Take bubble Guinea pig, 'cause I don't want him anymore. So that's it? That's all you're going to say? Bye, Jimmy. Good-bye. Can you still remember how it seemed that we could live forever in a lovers' dream?

God... Bless America! That nasty little slut left just in the nick of time, Morton. I had no idea what I was up against. Chloe hadn't told me much. All I knew was that she was in New York, which may as well been on the other side of the galaxy, and I only had three days to get there. Three days. I just needed the bubble suit to last that long. Flying high now I'm so high now Ooh! Ooh! Oh, oh, oh! Getting strong now moving on now Uhh! Aah! Grass. Street lamp. Oh. Ooh. Dog poop! This is awesome! I'm running! I'm running!

"Pay $100,000 or he dies. Signed, the Jews." Are you kidding? Are you kidding me? Who in their right mind is gonna believe this note? It's the Jews, Morton! They're gonna want more than $100,000!

I could use some stinkin' patches. Gil! Gil, we love you! Welcome, my children. Welcome. Today will truly be a time of spiritual illumination. Now, can anyone guess why we're all here? Ooh! Yes, Todd. To find... No, the other Todd. To find out the final incarnation of the chosen one? Exactly. I can see you've been reading your Kloobda. The chosen one is among us! He walks the earth. His final incarnation will be... A round one! Yes, the round one. The holy messenger trapped in a living globe. We must find him and release him so that he may carry us, only true believers, to the kingdom of heaven. And those who reject him will mutate and burn eternally on planet PX-41. Or PX-42... If they run out of room. If there are no further questions, let's move on to the buffet. So they kicked you out of the bus in the middle of the desert to die like some perro? Yep. Where you headed? Niagara Falls. I gotta get there by Saturday to stop Chloe from getting married to the wrong man. Ha ha ha ha! Let's cut the vato, huh, ese? I wasn't planning on cutting the vato, no. Somebody run off with your old lady, legally you're allowed to cut him. She wasn't technically my old lady. I just never, um... I just never told her how I felt. When I was your age, I was in love with a woman. Debbie? No. Oh, Danielle. No. Wildfire! Oh, Wildfire! She looks really nice. Yeah, but she left me for some other vato. You know, real buttoned-down, "I gotta get a job" kind of vato, you know? To this day, ese, I regret not finding him and cutting his heart out in a really violent way. Don't be like me, ese. Don't live in regret. We'll be riding wildfire We'll be riding Wildfire - Ohh! I'm... I'm ok. Look at the lights! Now this is Las Vegas, Jimmy! Wow! Paris! That's beautiful, ain't it? And New York! That's big New York. This is amazing, Slim. Ha ha ha ha! Go faster! Go faster! You like the wind in your hair? Yeah. Ha ha ha ha! "We have the loosest sluts." That's "slots"!

Excuse us. Excuse us. Come on, talk to me, babies. Lookin' good! Yes, all right. Slim? Yeah. What's it like? Ha ha ha ha ha! I could tell you what it was like with me and Wildfire. 1200 ccs of American steel vibrating between your legs. Oh, man. I'm talking fourth gear. 4,000 RPMs! Ay! Ha ha ha ha! That sounds amazing! Ha ha! Hey, hors d'oeuvres? Oh, no, thanks. I got my own. Ok. Last one. You go for it! Oh, no. I couldn't. Go on. You want to win the money for our trip, don't you? But what if I lose again? You didn't get out of that bubble room to play it safe, did you? You're right. Go for it. Oh! I'm tapped out. I'm gonna go steal some quarters from that blind lady. Slim, I don't think... Wait here!

Hey, have you seen my little buddy? He's got, like, frizzy hair, and he's... he's in a bubble. Hey, what's up? Uhh! Have you seen this little bubble guy, ma'am? I didn't mean it. Excuse. Hola. We're a bit lost. Could you tell us the way to... Niagara Falls? I beg your pardon? Yeah. 'Cause that's where my little buddy was headed when you left him in the desert to die! Come back! You bright and shinies... come back and get shiny on my knife, huh? Hey. Hey. Hey! Hey! Aah! This looks like Area 51. Holy mother of shit, Morton! What is that? A space creature? An alien? Oh, my God! Jimmy! Bow-wow ba-ba-ba bow-wow ba-ba-ba-ba Jimmy! Stop the car! Jimmy! Aah! Aah! Uhh! Aah! I wasn't quite sure just how I'd gotten on board, but I'd always dreamed of riding a train. Thank goodness the worst was behind me... Or so I thought. Look, he's awake. What are we going to do? Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Shh! Dr. Phreak is gonna hear you! He's gonna hear you! What? You gotta hide! Um... Wh... what did you say? He said be quiet or the doctor will hear you. Shh! Who are you? They call me the human sasquatch. What's your real name? Um... Clark? So what's your deal? Why are you in a bubble? To protect me from germs. I was born without any immunities, so even a single one could kill me. But your doctor would know all about that. Be quiet! He's not your average doctor. He's Dr. Phreak. We're all a part of his new traveling phreak show. He owns us. Owns you?! Shh! If he find out you're in this train, he'll own you, too. Oh, look! Oh, now you did it, bubble butt. Here he comes! Run for your life! Run! He's a vicious brute. You're Dr. Phreak? Ha ha ha ha! You're so mini! Ha ha ha! Mini? Oh, no! No! Me, mini?! I'm not mini! I'm not mini! Not! Not! Not! I'm not mini! Who the hell are you? He's the bubble boy. Shut your beak! What are you doing out of your coop? I shut up. You know, I could use some fresh meat in my show. Why don't you hop your little bubble butt back on that train? Uh, thanks, but, um... I gotta get to Niagara Falls by Saturday to stop Chloe from getting married. That's so, so beautiful. I, too, once loved another. Yeah? For ten minutes. Then I kicked her ass out of the car. Okay. Well, I gotta get going. Going?! Oh! Oh! What are you gonna do? You're a freak, and I should know. No decent girl's gonna want to marry a bubble freak. Once you get that through your thick, freaky skull, then give me a call. What's wrong with being a freak?! Uhh! Aah! Oh! Oh! That hurt! Doctor? Is he okay? He looks so sweet when he's not yelling. You've killed him. What are we going to do? Whoa! Good luck! Bye! Uhh! Heads up, bubble! Okay. Bye! Get your own bags! What do you think I am... bellhop? Hey, where are you guys going? We're going with you, Dr. Bubble. We're going with you. Dr. Bubble? No, no! No. I... you guys are free. You can do whatever you want now. Oh, we're free! Free as a bird! On to Niagara Falls! On to Niagara Falls! All the way! Oh, I love it! Look, you guys. Uh... I gotta do this alone. Oh, yeah. Bye! It sure was nice of the train man to loan me his vehicle, but if I was ever gonna make it to the wedding on time, I was gonna have to find something with a motor. Oh, my God! He ain't eating meat! Can you all believe it? It's tofu! Tofu! Could anybody give me a ride? Tofu gives me such gas! Bloody red meat! Rare! Rare American meat! You know, that's... that's the stupidest looking hat I've ever seen. It's adorable! It's adorable! Hey! Hey! Stop picking on him. Oh! Oh! I don't want any trouble. I'm just... Really? Sissy beach ball! Why are you in that bubble, boy? Huh? Well, um, because I was born without any immunities, and I... Immunities?! What the hell are immunities?! Well, I ain't sticking around to find out! Me neither. What? Everybody out! He's got immunities! No, no, no, no! He's contagious! I don't have any immunities! Don't try to change your story now, boy! I don't have germs! I'm not contagious! I just need a ride! I need a ride! I hereby declare this place quarantined! I don't have germs! I don't... Oh! Ohh! What's going on, sheriff? Guys, I think your building's on fire. Carl Peterson's best pig just died! It's spreading! It's spreading! Burn, baby, burn Disco inferno Burn, baby, burn Burn that mother down, y'all Burn, baby, burn Disco inferno Burn, baby, burn Whoo! Just like Calcutta in the summer! Come! Follow me! Come on! Whoa!

Can you tell me, have you seen my son? He's wearing a large plastic bubble suit. I know what you want. I'll give you some candy. He stole my freaks, that son of a bitch! Oh! What a potty mouth you have! Where was he going? Screw you, lady! Aah! Thanks. Thanks for saving me back there. You're welcome. Those were some crazy vatos. For some unknown reason, Shiva has brought you into my life like a hot flash. You came to my defense, and the law of karma requires me to return the favor. You see, this ice cream truck is merely a catalyst, a way to teach the wisdom of the sacred cow. For who can resist ice cream, eh? I know I can't. So, how may I be of service to you, my zip-locked friend? I need to get to Niagara Falls by Saturday to stop Chloe from getting married. Oh. I was thinking more along the lines of a free snow cone, but, okay. Niagara Falls it is. Livin' in the Land of the Lost livin' in the Land... No way is this better than Jurassic Park. I can't believe you and bubble geek actually liked this show. The effects look totally fake. That's the whole point. What? It's supposed to look fake? I'm not here. Hello? What have you done with my son? Mrs. Livingston? Is he with you? How could he be here? Well, apparently he's on his way to your wedding in a bubble suit, exposing himself to all the wickedness and filth this world has to offer! And you're responsible! Come on! Over here! Come on! Come on! Over here! Come on! This way! Come on! Let's go, Morton. Correction. You two aren't going anywhere until I get my freaks back. Don't you take that tone of voice with me, young man! Morton, are you just gonna sit there and let him talk to me like that? Yeah, Mort. Are ya? My car! My freaks! Help! Jimmy! Aah! Jimmy! Help! Hang on! Hang on! Aah! Screw you, grumpy! Hop on, babe. Thanks for saving me, Mark. How do you do it? Immunities, baby. Immunities. Aah! Aah! Aah! Oh, dear. Oh! Oh! Look at that. It's an elk. Or is it a caribou? Or an American bison? I, uh... I think that it's a cow. Oh, really?! A cow?! I didn't know. What have I done? It's just a cow, Pushpop. It's not... Just a cow? Just a cow?! In my religion, the cow is the womb from which all life springs! Heh heh heh! I have transgressed against Shiva! Shiva? The six-armed goddess. Have you ever been karmically bitch-slapped by a six-armed goddess? I'll take that as a no! Oh! Um... It's ok, Pushpop. Your religion's all lies. Pardon? That's what my mom says. I mean... Bollocks. I must atone. His mother taught him. What nonsense. May Shiva shine upon your journey! Well, can't we, uh... Can't we drive and atone? No. One for the road. What? No, no, no. Um... There are germs in here! Frozen! No germs! No germs? When did this happen? Thanks for the lift! So long! Ice cream It was one thing that my mom had never heard of the bitch-slapping goddess, but it seemed like everybody should have heard of frozen, germ-free ice cream. Ohh! Everybody loves ice cream. Stripper. Dykes. Dear lord, if thou findest the stealing of this truck offensive in any way, please direct thy wrath upon that midget and not upon us, thy humble servants. Amen. All right.

Where's my Kloobda? Right there, Lorraine! Thank you. You're welcome. Wait a minute! You're not a shiny! Who are you? Uh... Todd? Oh! Hi, Todd. Wait a minute! What's the matter with your arms? What are you talking about? There's nothing wrong with my arms! We're too late! We're mutating! We're gonna get you out through the front of the bus. Oh, God! Why won't you help me? Ha ha ha ha! He's got a bubbly face and a bubbly nose Mr. Bubble Bubble, bubblicious the ultimate bubble. Tiny bubbles Tiny bubbles in the wine I know. I miss him, too. Come on, bubble boy! Hurry up! Come on! This way, guys! Hurry! This way! Ow! Guys! Oh! Hey! Come on! Todd! Hey, shinies! We have some unfinished business, huh? No, no, Slim. They're my friends. They got him brainwashed! No! No! No! Wait! Bubble, we're gonna help you out! Don't worry! I'll take you all on with one flipper behind my back! You want a mouthful of tuna? Free Willy! Free Willy! You're all... I'm gonna whup that ass! Yeah! Yeah! Aah! Oh, my God! Get it off of me! Get it off of me! Ha ha ha ha! Niagara Falls, and step on it! It's the cops! Wait a minute! Don't touch me there! Wait a minute! Where's bubble boy? You ask me if I love you and I choke on my reply I'd rather hurt you honestly Poon--! Huh? Chasing a dame, aren't you? Who am I to judge you Last time I was in a commotion like that, it was all on account of poon--! Oh, what the astronauts drink. No, no. My wife. My little China doll. Yeah, till that damn brother of mine took her off to Waxahachie. Snatched my poon--! right out from under me. 86 years ago. I ain't spoke to that bastard since. Don't live in regret, ese. He's your family. Family. Heh. I really gotta go! I told you, once we're on the road we're not stopping! Than mislead you with a lie And after all that, they still didn't get you a new puppy? No. Ohh. Poor little thing. No wonder you turned out the way you did. Ohh. And sometimes when we touch the honesty's too much Morning, Pappy. You must be tired. You get any sleep? Ha ha ha! Heh heh. I said, you get any sleep? Pappy! Pappy? Pappy? Pappy? Pappy! Stop! Aah! Oh! Ow! Yow! Yeah, I'm fine. You have a phone? Yello. Hello? Hi. Is Chloe there? Uh, who can I say is calling? It's Jimmy. Oh. Hello, Jimmy. Where the hell are you? I'm really close. Like, in New York, I think. Look, I don't mean to burst your bubble, Jimbo, but if you got a thing for Chloe, it's not gonna happen, okay? We're getting married in one hour. What are you expecting to happen, huh? You can't even touch her. How are you gonna have children? Do you even have sperm? Face it, dude, you're a charity case. Chloe just felt sorry for you because you lived in a bubble. Do us all a favor. Go on back to Palmdale where you belong. I wasn't quite sure what Mark meant about the sperm... But he was right about one thing. Even if I did get there... I couldn't ever really hold Chloe in my arms or kiss her for real. I really was a freak. Hello. Hi, Dr. Phreak. It's Jimmy. Jimmy who? The bubble boy. Jimmy?! Give me that! That's my phone! Hello? Jimmy? Mom? Jimmy! What are you doing with Dr. Phreak? Where are you? Oh! Okay, sweetheart, we'll be right there. Don't move! Morton, we've got our boy back! Gimme that. Aah! Ow! Ooh! Ow! Eek! Ohh! Son of a bitch. Mama. Ohh! Aah! I never stole anything before and I just fell off a dead man's car and this is the girl I love's favorite beer and I was just wondering, could I borrow it? Yeah, sure. Thanks. Now open the safe! Do it! Chop chop! Ohh... Aah! The sweet lord has delivered you from evil. Ohh! I must say, you put us through heck, young man! But I think you learned a valuable lesson. There's no place like home. Okay, Morton, load him in the car. The spirit's burning so strong in my bosom, I think I have to wee-wee. How... ahem... how was it out there? Was it fun? You can see the moon today. You know, it kind of makes you wonder what would have happened if Neil Armstrong had gone all the way to the moon... And then never stepped on the surface. Jimmy! Morton, where's Jimmy?! What happened? Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! Come to mommy! No, mom! I'm sorry! I gotta do this! It's all right to tell me I'm not coming home! Jimmy! Todd! Jimmy! Todd, we love you! We've come to set you free! Who the hell are you? Back off, bitch! He's the messiah! We love you, Todd! Jimmy, no! Pedal to the metal, flippy! Look! Well, I guess this is growing up Hey! Whoa! Oh! Jimmy! Ha ha ha! Vaya con dios, bubble boy. Hang on, kid. Pappy? Wh... aah! Watch out! Slim? Wildfire? Wildfire What happened to you, Pappy? I thought you were dead. I ain't Pappy. I'm Pippy. I ain't talked to that sumbitch brother of mine in 86 years. And that's all on account of that... Poon--! Poonani! Poonani? Sister to poon--! Well, Pappy talked about poon--! but he never mentioned any poonani, Pippy. Oh! Ha ha! Oh, my gosh! I made it! I made it! Ha ha ha! Niagara Falls! Niagara Falls! Oh, there's the church! There's the church! Chloe! Ha ha ha! Take me down, Pippy! Take me down! Oh, we're goin' down. Very fast. Pippy! Aah! Chloe! You didn't break out of that bubble room to play it safe. Don't live in regret, ese. No regrets. No regrets. No regrets. No regrets. No regrets! No regrets! No regrets! I made it! Ha ha ha! Score, dude. Mmm. Mmm. I'm late! I'm late! Do you, Mark, take Chloe... To be your lawfully-wedded wife? To honor and cherish, in sickness and in health, as long as you both shall live? Oh, yeah. I'm almost there! I'm almost... And do you, Chloe... Take Mark to be your lawfully-wedded husband, to honor and cherish, in sickness and in health, as long as you both shall live? Come on, babe. Easy question. Chloe! Chloe! Jimmy! Hey, dude, what the hell are you doing here? I thought I told you to head on home? Just hold on a second, vato. Vato? Shut up! Am I out of line here? Chloe, I, uh... What? What? Jimmy, what are you doing? Jimmy? Jimmy? I'd rather spend one minute holding you than the rest of my life knowing I never could. So if you don't mind... May I kiss the bride? Is it me? I love you. I love you, Chloe. Jimmy? Forever. Okay? Jimmy?! No! Jimmy! Jimmy? I love you, Jimmy. I've always loved you. He's dead! You killed him! Oh! Ohh! Oh, Jimmy! My little sweet Jimmy. Ohh. Oh, my angel. My precious little one. My angel. Tell him. What are you talking about? Tell him what? He's not dead. You're not dead, Jimmy. He's lying. Tell him. Tell him everything. Ohh... You're not dead, Jimmy. I'm not? Ohh! You developed immunities when you were four. I couldn't bear to let the world ruin you with its filth! There are so many awful things out there, Jimmy. There's so many horrible... I love you, mom. Oh! Ohh. Mmm. Ain't that sweet. Oh. So... Since I'm not dead, um... Wouldn't it be nice if we were older then we wouldn't have to wait so long wouldn't it be nice to live together in the kind of world where we belong May Shiva bless your union.
