Love... intoxication... that's obsession When you're obsessed... ''you skip heartbeats, and this is what you utter...'' that's life... being obsessed An obsession ''Sister, parties bore you. Yet you come with your son and stare at girls. Why?'' Because l don't want my son to remain a bachelor like you You mean parties get you married? But l've been partying since years Hello aunt. Come... ''l thought you weren't coming... careful, aunt'' ''Mr Mehta, meet Mrs Goyal. - Hello'' And this is her son. Mr Raj Goyal l'm honoured to have you here. - We've heard lots about you ''And tonight we see you in person, thanks to brother Vikrant'' My husband nursed a desire to meet you. - Just wanted to see the person... who never ever lost a case. Well l also hear that... those who have your visiting card can call you up without hesitation ''That's a rumour, Mr Mehta. Don't make that mistake, else you'll be in trouble'' ''How are you? - Fine, how have you been?'' Absolutely fine ''What's your name, dear? - Yana'' ''Yana...? Nice name, suits you'' By the way... You were saying something? - No... nothing ''Friends, tonight is a joyous occasion'' Our seventh music album is also celebrating platinum jubilee All thanks to my brother Abhijit's music ln taking Sky Audio to such great heights... two others have immensely contributed ''One, the famous music director, Mr Vikrant Kapoor'' ''Second, the one whose melodious voice and her breathtaking beauty...'' has cast a spell us on.

Whereas l'm a lawyer... ''l dare not say, ''Welcome to the court, you got a nice trial coming up'' ''Ma, meet Sargam. This is my Ma, and that's my uncle'' l'm here fan. - l'm also a great fan of you Are you alone here? l mean your parents haven't come? l have no one ''A few years back, in a car accident my parents...'' Do not think you're alone anymore ''l'm like your mother, come to me whenever you feel like it'' And l'd find a daughter in you Let's go before it's too late Praise be to Lord Shiva ''Bhulva! Banwari! Come here, quick! Call up the police'' ''Sir, we've sealed the entire house. The forensic guys are on it'' lt's been half-hour or so ''Take one picture, here'' He's stabbed here... here... Not in my entire career have l seen such a gruesome murder This is the height of animosity. The assassin could be a lunatic ''Sir, this man, in bloodstained clothes, is fleeing towards Madh lsland'' Hot news. Ashwin Mehta murdered Assassin caught redhanded ''Ashwin Mehta, who took music to new heights, is no more'' His corpse was found in his bungalow near Madh lsland The entire music industry bemoans his loss His corpse has been sent for autopsy ''Taran, Mr Mehta's assassin, was caught redhanded'' Killed a nice man. He should be hanged Sargam...? ''l'm so sorry, l can't believe... - l came to talk to you about it'' ''Sure, please sit down'' ''Sorry, l came without even calling up. - Please don't bother'' Please do me a favour. l want Mr Mehta's... You want me to get his assassin the severest punishment l want you to save him ''Taran cannot commit murder, Raj'' Now way. - How do you know Taran? ''He's my guru. What l am today, is all thanks to him. He taught me music'' ''But Sargam, he was caught redhanded'' ''Taran is innocent, l'm dead sure. l know, you always stand by the truth'' Lies and liars you can tell at a glance ''Which is why l want you to meet him just once, for my sake'' Then it's upto you to decide whether he's innocent or guilty l'm Raj. Raj Goyal ''l'm a lawyer. - To pay your fees, l don't have...'' Sargam sent me ''l was sure, Sargam would stand by me'' ''Tell me Taran, why did you commit this murder?'' ''l did nothing, sir'' Have you been arrested before for any crime? ''No, sir. - Raj. They call me Raj'' ''Do you stammer? - No, why?'' ''You feel so, sir?'' So you didn't commit this murder? - Mr Mehta was a nice man lt was due to him that l own a house ''He gave me 50,000. He was supposed to give me an opportunity to sing'' ''My tunes, my songs... he like them so much'' His death is a big loss to me Are you trying to say that you had no genuine reasons to kill him? ''Can any reason be genuine when it comes to murder, Raj?'' What were you doing at Mehta's house? - We had a music sitting l was waiting at the lobby when l suddenly heard a scream ''l ran inside, and saw him lying in a pool of blood on the floor'' Someone was running away from the backdoor There was someone else in the room? - Yes Who? - l couldn't see his face Then? - l remember nothing else You don't remember? What do you mean? ''lt happens to me, at times'' You can call it a disease. Suddenly l'm blinded For a while l go completely blank. - And you remember nothing? But... you did nothing... then why did you flee? ''When l came to, my clothes were bloodstained'' l heard the servants screaming that the assassin is inside l was petrified ''Nice! Amnesia is a convenient disease. - Happens, Uncle...'' like l forgot to sugar the tea. - And he forgot he committed murder? How could someone flummox you? l think this man is very smart ''lf he is so clever, would he present such a credulous alibi?'' Somehow l get this feeling... ln his eyes... l didn't see the convict's terror ''Sonia, do you know any psychiatrist?'' ''Following the incident, he might have entered...'' fused state. - Fused state...? Fused state relates to stress-related temporary amnesia Like sleep-walkers who don't realise having moved ''Also during fits of epilepsy, the victim enters ''fused state''...'' remembers nothing ''Doctor, l'll need your help on this case'' l'm rigging up this camera because l want to watch it over and over again ''Very warm in here, isn't it?'' ''Say something, about yourself, about your work, your parents'' Daddy was a renowned classical vocalist there was such magic in his voice... ''for hours on end, l'd listen to him .... when l was seven or eight...'' he died After his death... my mother was so traumatised... ''for days together, she'd walk the village streets looking for him'' And afterwards? l found a job as a janitor at the library l loved reading l read up all the books... became a librarian... all the time worrying for my Ma... worrying whether she has had lunch. Then one day... end of all worries Found her corpse in a well ''Tell me, when did you realise that you suffer from forgetfulness?'' After Ma was dead... l sat crying ''A while later, l asked my neighbours to help me carry my dead'' ''They were surprised and said, Have you gone mad?'' You just cremated your mother. Madam till this day... l don't remember setting fire to my Ma's pyre Defending this will be the worst mistake in Raj Goyal's career You think Taran is innocent? - Very soon... the truth will out. l believe truth always triumphs Make way Before making any statements l would like to show a few photographs Do these photographs prove that my client committed the murder? My purpose of showing the photos... - To create a sentiment... against my client before opening the case... with the intent of adversely influencing judgement by law... by using sentiment to upstage the truth ''Mr Bhullar, do you wish to present any other evidence or witness?'' According to the forensic report was the assailant... right handed or left-handed? - Wounds in the neck suggest... that they were inflicted by a left-handed person So according to you...? - Yes The accused is left-handed too. - Should a right-handed person... ''use his left hand intentionally, would it leave similar wounds...'' as were found on Mr Ashwin? - Yes You mean you can't be certain that the assailant was left-handed? ''No, cannot be said for sure'' ''When you apprehended the accused, he pleaded innocence'' Why made you refuse to believe him? - l arrested the accused... red-handed Were the fingerprints of the accused found on the weapon of murder? ''Which the accused may have erased. - Possible, but...'' ''after erasing his fingerprints, he bloodies his hands...'' ''and then he runs, so that you may catch him red-handed. Also feasible?'' We'll let it pass. But can you tell me... was anyone else present in the room at the time of the murder? That is anyone apart from my client? - No such evidence was found You found evidence to prove that a third person wasn't present? No Reason Motive ''Behind every act, there must be motive as yours is to deliver justice'' The public prosecutor's motive is to hang the accused l wish to save an innocent life. The motive to find what the truth is... brings everyone else here. Each and everyone here... has a motive ''But there's no motive behind so terrible a murder. Amazing, no?'' ''There's nothing on the chargesheet, nor in the police files. Well why?'' ''Taran, why are you talking like this? - Like what...?'' ''Don't you worry a bit, l'm around'' ''l won't let anything happen to you, l'll come to see you'' ''Sister-in-law, let's go'' ''For the first time ever, my son is interested in a girl'' ''lf he can't proposition her, he isn't ever getting married'' ''My dear sister, of late he has been seeing Sargam regularly'' They've struck up a fine friendship. - And all they discuss is the case ''lndeed. But to turn it into an affair... - We can do our bit, Ratan'' Go and buy some of Sargam's pin-ups. l'll call Sargam right away Are we to make an exhibition of her pin-ups? ''Of course, if you've thought it up we can work wonders'' Look! Posters of you plastered all over his room Raj did that...? - l didn't ''Not just posters. Look, all your cds'' My son has become your fan. - You know... ''l thought Raj is a serious sort, miles apart from music'' l can't fathom this either! All he ever read were books on law ''Now he keeps listening to your music, knows your songs by heart, word-to-word'' ''Uncle, is Sargam here?'' No... - Whose car is parked outside? Upstairs Welcome son ''What are you wondering about? Come on, give me a hug'' ''How are you, Ma? What's all this?'' Tea...? You want tea? Right away Are you secretive? - Secretive? You never told me how much you appreciate my music ''Tell me, which of mine is your most favourite?'' That... the biggest hit - Which one? The one about love and romance ''That's one number l love too. Come on, sing it'' ''Who me? - Yes, why not?'' ''l can't sing, Sargam'' l cannot sing ''Don't put on, your Mummy told me, you have a wonderful singing voice'' Really? Ma told you that too? Wonderful plot! - Wait and watch How did she get in here? - Through the open door Hi Yana! Welcome! - Where's Sargam? She has left. - Left already But her car is parked outside. - Handle that Cars are always parked outside. She went out with Raj With Raj? She asked me to come here. - She wants you to go home Home...? - Told you to take her car ''Her car? - She insisted, right away'' ''Must be something urgent... - Yes, very urgent...'' ''But next time you come, make sure you stay for tea'' How can you send Sargam's car away? - How else will Raj give her a lift? lndeed! Sister! Wonderful What if Raj refuses? ''Look, a fair'' ''As a kid, l loved going to fairs! - Oh yes?'' ''Even now, l wish l could go to fairs. But what to do...?'' ''You know, Taran's Daddy adored me'' Always took me to every fair ''Why have you brought me to this fair? - At times, do what you want to'' ''No! There's going to be a mob. - Nothing, just come out'' ''Look, Sargam... - You see a Sargam? She's a look-alike'' This is the right time for romance Romance is about to enter your life ''Who knows, she may be near'' ''Feel, it's a wonderful emotion'' Tell me about Sargam ''She says you are childhood friends, you grew up together?'' You even started learning music together? Yes ''l played the flute, she danced'' Come to me ''Wonderful pair. - Badri, l think...'' your girl and my boy are made for each other ''Makes life easier for me, l don't have to go looking for a suitable boy'' ''Taran, will you become my son-in-law?'' ''Will you love my Sargam? - Give him a reply, son'' Then... we were separated ''Her Daddy found a job, they migrated'' You must've been very sad. And what did you do? ''Let go of her. - Come on, son'' What's his problem? - He says... ''lf she goes away whom will l marry? - You'll marry Sargam, first grow up'' ''Go on, you'll miss your train. - l'll write to you'' As soon as you reach ''Silly, why are you crying? - Poor boy, she was his only friend'' ''Son, when old friends part, you find new friends'' l never found a new friend We kept the conversation alive until the letters finally stopped They had migrated again. - How did you find her? ''She was struggling to become a singer, the magazines carried an interview'' She said missed her village and her friend travelled to this city This is Taran! My best friend My playmate ''And we were together, always'' She talked endlessly... ''when day finished, when night began l never got to know'' Once she said... ''when l hear you sing, l feel lost'' l feel as if l don't know how to sing at all ''Taran, teach me how to sing'' ''The seven notes is known to the world...'' you are the eighth one ''The seven notes is known to the world...'' you are the eighth one ''The seven colours is known to the world...'' you are the eighth one You are the eighth colour ''Friend, find comfort in music...'' in times of despair ''Friend, find comfort in music...'' in times of despair ''Sing a song to light up your life...'' during moonless nights ''The moon is known to the world...'' you are the moon of my life ''The seven colours is known to the world...'' you are the eighth one You colour my life ''The seven notes are known to the world...'' you are the eighth one You are the eighth note You are the eighth note Sargam was right. You sing so well ls this your compostion? - Yes For Sargam? ''You love her dearly, no? - What do you think?'' Purpose. Reason. Cause. Motive... Four times this young genius raised this point... ''and four times, the court was adjourned'' ''Today, l shall state the motive'' ls this diary yours? ''l ask you, is this diary yours? - Yes'' Language of music. Your music? l'm asking. Your music? - Yes The songs... written by you? The same songs contained in the cds? But the name of the music director is Abhijit Mehta? Why not your name? Answer. Why is your name not there? ''Your creation, someone else gets credit? What's going on?'' l'll tell you. Abhijit's music that took music by storm two years ago... isn't really Abhijit's. lt's Taran Bhardwaj's music Taran Bhardwaj's music ''Taran sold his music for a paltry 50,000'' The fortunes of Ashwin Mehta's Sky Audio soared A flop music director is flooded with awards ''But Poor Taran, left high and dry. That's the genesis of jealousy'' He went looking for a fight. He had sold no more than a few songs But they had robbed all his music. Rage drove Taran insane ''Not money, he wanted fame! Some day you will own up'' ''That was my music, you will say it was Taran's music'' To bring his brother's murderer to the book... Abhijit has made a great sacrifice. He has destroyed his own career Only for the sake of justice What do you want? lsn't life dear? Want to go to the gallows? ''All witnesses, all evidences prove you guilty'' Everyone thinks you're a murderer. l'm the only one who trusts you And you never told me that it was your music l was sworn. He would've been brought to disgrace ''Had you asked me, l'd never have lied to you'' All this case lacked was motive And these guys are stressing that this was your motive to kill Mehta Plagiarism is common in the music world ''Sometimes it's called remix, sometimes inspiration'' But does someone murder over it? ''l admit l went to him, not to fight...'' but to know from the gentleman why he deceived me ''lt's an embarrassment for me, Taran. Abhijit didn't even ask me'' ''Can't help it. He's my little brother, after all'' ''Besides, it concerns his career. - But sir...'' ''l promise you Taran, you'll record the next album for me'' Here... take it. Find some accomodation l just wanted some place to stay. Music runs in my blood With my Father's blessings and the Goddess Saraswati's grace... l thought l would compose more songs ''Honestly Raj, l did not commit the murder'' ''lf there's someone who holds you back from death, it's me'' ''lf you keep hiding things from me, it'll be tough for me'' But it'll be even difficult for you. You understand my point? ''l won't be hanged, will l?'' Trust me ''We'll win this case, won't we Raj? - l can't afford to lose, Sargam'' Because alongwith my honour it concerns Raj's life l'll stake even my life but l'll get justice done to him ''l'm glad to be friends with a gentleman like you, Raj'' l can see Taran's pain in your eyes. You even waived his fees ''For you, l waived his fees'' For me? - Yes. Because l found a friend in you And as a friend you'll help solve my problem Problem? You have one? ''Actually, this thing called love, l thought it was all trash'' ''But after meeting someone, for the first time l realised...'' ''if there's something that's very special, that's love'' ''Without love, name, fame, wealth, respect...'' everything is trash So what's your problem? - l haven't professed my love yet Why don't you do it? - l fear her refusal How would she know if you don't profess your love? ''Okay suppose l profess my love to her, how'll l know if she loves me or not?'' ''lf she blushes, then it's yes'' ''lf she's furious and walks away, then it's no'' Shall l tell her? Really? - Yes lt's me. How are you? l need to tell you something ''Sweetheart you are endearing than love'' ''The more the love l feel for you, the lesser it is'' ''You set my heart beating, you stole me away from myself'' ln you l found life Love happens only once ''The bond l share with you, l share not even with God'' ''l can't hold myself back at the sight of you'' l send you in a tizzy? l too go berserk My state is no different from you ''You set my heart beating, you stole me away from myself'' ln you l found life ''Sweetheart you are endearing than love'' ''The more the love l feel for you, the lesser it is'' Your suspicions turned true Mrs Mehta surely knows something about her husband's murder ''Yes Raj, l recorded her argument with her brother-in-law Abhijit'' ''l mean, we taped it. - She can shed some light'' Absolutely. She wouldn't want it to be told in the courtroom what's personal ''Are you out of your mind, sister-in-law?'' What comes over you at the sight of Taran? Why can't you face him? Why did you leave the courtroom? - Because he did not kill your brother lt was God who punished him for his sin Please! Don't say such things over the phone What sin was your husband's? What was he punished for? There's surely something that's not easy to tell ''Please, break free from all bonds, and stand for the truth'' Your husband is no more But the person who is caught for his murder is still alive Please tell me. Tell me the truth! What am l to tell you? For the first time when you attended our party... that night... ''Come, Sargam'' You must accept a drink from me tonight Behind that innocent mask is hidden a lousy face l'm not working with you anymore ''We're drinking, and you seem to be sozzled'' ''You are Mr Ashwin's find. Whatever you are today, is because of him'' ''ln return if brother wants to display a little friendship, what's the harm?'' ''Well, Abhijit, you may not know the first note of music...'' but you sure do know how to convince girls for your brother Why don't you quit music and start pimping for your brother? ''Had l bedded this wretch on the very first day, she'd not be raving now'' Who do you think you are? You'll now see the lousy face behind this smiling mask. Right now Where is your brother? - He just went downstairs ''Yes, downstairs. - Why are you fretting?'' ''Oh no, we're enjoying the party'' ''Sister-in-law! Take her down, man! - Step aside, Abhijit!'' Don't... don't... - l could never imagine... this is how l'd have to repay l could see Karan's torment in his eyes l could see a tempest rising in his silent eyes... and the very next day...! You still haven't answered me. Are you in love with Sargam? l asked you something. - Can we discuss this later? My question isn't that tough What is the matter? l have a headache. - l see ''Tell me, has Sargam ever said that she loves you?'' Tell me Does that remain to be said? Love need not be expressed... love can be felt. - Then you have felt her love? l do not wish to discuss this. - But why? l told you... l got a headache ''So Mr Taran, what else do you feel?'' ''Shut up, bitch'' You talk a lot of crap l'm going to carve you up You got a sharp tongue l might use scissors on you Just what l feared. Taran suffers from a split personality ''Split personality? - Yes, two entirely different facades'' Taran must have suffered much insult But his good nature prevented him from reacting ''The rage he buried within, has bred the split personality'' l just had a brief glimpse ''lt's quite physical, rather violent'' He himself doesn't know what he might do Don't go in there Fraud! You lied about being innocent Fraud! Enough of your melodrama Admit it! You committed this murder Admit ''Don't look away, look at me'' ''Look, l know that you know what the truth is'' ''And l want to hear it from you. Tell me, say it'' ''Raj, l have done nothing, nothing'' Lies And l'm proving a criminal innocent! For the first time in my life... ''l'm cheating the law. - No, l did nothing'' ''lt was premeditated murder, committed in cold blood'' ''No, l have done nothing... nothing'' ''You are a murderous, lying, criminal'' Shut up ''What do you want now, Taran? You're always coming to me, crying'' Have you no dignity? Who are you? - You are who? ''Yes, Taran's lawyer. You scream at him? You scare him?'' ''lf you ever scream at him again, l'm going to carve you up'' But you never told me who you are. - Oh sorry. l'm Ranjit... l'm Taran's friend. And he can't do a thing without my help You mean Taran didn't kill Mr Mehta? Taran? He can't even talk properly. You think he can kill? He hasn't the guts. - Then... you committed murder? But... why? Bitch... life's a bitch... kills poor innocent sods They stole all his music ''One day he comes to me, l tell him, go kill them'' ''He says, no...no...no. l say, go and cry'' He comes again... ''Ranjit, they've ruined my Sargam! Tried to rape her'' He thinks Sargam is his wife. When they were kids... ''their parents wanted them engaged. Poor thing, he wept inconsolably'' l cannot bear to see him cry. l carved up the bastard Tore him apart. 56 times He was such a rogue! Even his blood was black What happened...? Taran is innocent. He's sick. He deserves medical help ''He doesn't deserve to be punished, Raj. His place isn't in the dungeons'' ''Poor thing, he is so unfortunate. He could never even express his love'' Sargam never understood his love l know hearing this isn't easy for you. But this is the truth... his suppressed desire also contributed to Taran's transformation into Ranjit You're still with me... l can feel you ''You will return to me, l'm sure'' My heart's grieving... since years now Such purity... such innocence... such ardour... such obsession... l never felt before ''At the very first sight, my heart said...'' you are the one... you are my life You are... my obsession ''Wonderful! Dr Sen, l appreciate your grasp of the subject'' But how can you be certain about Taran's split personality? l have witnessed his transformation myself ''You may see it too, if you admit the videotapes as evidence'' ''Behind closed doors, even l can act before a camera. Forget it'' Can you provide any other evidence? - Are you feigning ignorance? ''Just for winning a case, will you play with the life of an innocent?'' ''At the age of seven, he lost his father his mother went mad. Please, think...'' ''how his mother's condition might've affected him, at that tender age'' ''You mean, his mother's company drove Taran mad? Amazing...'' ''how come doctors who live among madmen for years, don't go crazy?'' What's so unique about Taran? Yes! His mother's lunacy must've been evil ''ln the passing, she bequeathed her madness to her son'' Bless the mother that bred a madman who forgets that he committed murder Enough ''Stop it, for God's sake'' No Raj... l don't want to contest this case. Let me hang What use this justice that ridicules... my dead mother's suffering? l have a headache ''Tell me, has Sargam ever said that she loves you?'' Does that remain to be said? Love need not be expressed... ''love can be felt. - So Mr Taran, what else do you feel?'' ''Shut up, bitch'' You talk a lot of crap! l'm going to carve you up We have only one option if we're to save Taran We must exhibit Ranjit in court. We can prove that he's mentally ill... ''if the judge sees Ranjit as we saw him. - But Raj, how...?'' Don't worry. l got something worked out but l need your help ''Do you even need to ask for my help? l'm with you, till the end'' You started your music career with Mr Mehta's Sky Audio? What made you sever ties with the company that made you famous? ''How is it related to this case? - lt is, we shall see very soon'' ''You didn't say why you did that, why wouldn't you work with Mr Mehta?'' ls it true that Mr Ashwin Mehta was janus faced... ''in private life, different from what he seemed?'' ''Tell us, is it not true that Mr Mehta had an eye for you?'' On the night of the Sky Audio party... ''Mr Mehta tried to rape you, he tried to molest you?'' ''Of course you know, Ranjit'' ''Tell us Mr Sargam, what happened that night'' ''Yes, that's true. Mr Ashwin Mehta wasn't a nice man'' ''That night, he tried to force himself upon me'' He was a pervert and he was malicious Bloody coward Mr Mehta's character is of no consequence to this case But he was a good friend of mine and he is being maligned in this court Therefore l shall not be silenced Tell me... ''lf Taran was your guru, how come you succeeded and he didn't?'' ''Luck, maybe'' ''lf you dared to bare to win favours from the rich, would you say you're in luck?'' Wonderful luck Mr Mehta told me how you encashed your beauty You used excuses to get close to him ''You were always inviting him home, you were ever ready to sleep with him'' Which night are you talking about? You wanted him every night Taran never had a problem about his beau having an affair with someone else ''Taran's problem was, he was gaining nothing out of the relationship'' He was gaining nothing ''Where are you going, you bloody cur?'' ''Even barking like a dog, holster-around-the-neck-and-all'' How are you? One dull headache... Do you remember what you did a while ago? l did something terribly wrong? - Whatever you did was right The court has acquitted you. Now you are free ''You will stay in a hospital, but only until you recover'' ''You have done me a great favour! Raj! To me, you are like a god'' ''What are you doing? Listen, l have done nothing for you'' You are a good man and the truth always triumphs ''Now stop worrying, Taran. l'll go to the hospital to see you'' Just take care of yourself. May l take your leave now? Mr Bhullar's neck... is he all right? Will you tell him l'm sorry? - l'll tell him What did you say? You can't recollect whatever happens during these seizures? How come you remember about Mr Bhullar's neck? ''Taran, l'm asking you something'' What for are you giving me that stare? Who am l? Taran..? Ranjit...? Who do you want to see? Taran? Ranjit? Or both? ''Mr Raj, you ought to be elated. My acquittal has made you famous'' ''Just sleep over it, don't dig too deep'' ''Ranjit-Taran is like a quagmire, you might get sucked in...'' to your death Was that a shock? The police caught me red-handed. lf not this disease... what other alibi was l left with? Like the wise old men say... knowledge never goes waste. Back home in the village... ''l read a book in the library, about split personalities...'' happened to be of good use Wondering why l told you all this? ''Sargam is all praise for you. Tells me, you didn't charge fees...'' for defending my case. Why...? ''For me, Sargam is my wife. lf anyone looks at her...'' it drives me crazy l could stab 56 times without realising it You're a nice guy. So... You get it? Stay away Thank you Mr Raj l should be leaving Do you stammer? ''You feel so, sir?'' You can call it a disease. l'm suddenly blinded ''Can any motive be valid when it comes to murder, Raj?'' ''Lawyer, wondering if l am Taran or Ranjit?''
