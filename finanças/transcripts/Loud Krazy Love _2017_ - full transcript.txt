[indistinct shouting on TV] [crowd cheering] [man on TV] Fieldy and Head from the band Korn whose album Issues hits stores today. [woman on TV] And the winner is... Korn, "Freak On A Leash." [Brian] I'd like to thank this band right here, the hardest workin' band in rock and roll. The band is named Korn and they are celebrating in New England. [David Letterman] I wanted to mention one thing before we get too much farther into the show. Korn rules. [indistinct chatter] [crowd cheering] [laughing] [cheering] I'm Kurt Loder with MTV News this hour with Chris Rock on the late comic Phil Hartman. First though, there's a baby boom of sorts going on in the music world at the moment. Korn has had to cancel this Saturday's Ozzfest date in England in order to allow guitarist Brian Welch to jet back to the States to be with his wife who is due to give birth imminently. And there's the inevitable... [baby crying] [Brian] The day Jennea was born was, like, the most euphoric... miraculous unconditional love, like total... purity in the room. But... I think deep down inside of me, I knew I was incapable... of being what she needed and deserved.

[Phil] He was like a normal kid. You know, if you see the picture of him in junior high, you know, he had on Dockers and a button down shirt and he... Short hair and... Then high school came. I don't think he thought he fit in. He discovered fairly early that hard rock music. Remember the Ozzy Osbourne and... Yeah. I don't know, Black Sabbath and... Some of those posters he had even when he was 10, 12 years old, on-on his bedroom walls. And I used to walk down the hallway at home and poke my head in and say, "Would you, please, play 'Ghost Riders In The Sky' so I can recognize what you're playing?" Oh, hey, dude. There's no, there's no metal on this one. Here we go. [Brian] We were just a normal family, you know. My mom and dad worked pretty much at, you know, 8 to 4, 9 to 5 type of job and, you know, we, uh... My school was at the end of the cul-de-sac, so that was cool. ♪ I'm hot ♪ ♪ And when I'm not ♪ ♪ I'm cold as ice ♪♪ [Brian] To, like, be given that dream... I mean, it couldn't have got bigger for us. It was just like, "Are you serious?" "Blind" by Korn [Reginald] He's like, "I wanna start a band. You know, I got a drummer." He said, "I need a bass player." He's like, "Bass is easy, you just kinda, just ride E." I'm like, "Cool." [James] There's always been a, a back and forth with our guitar playing. I mean, both of us are playing guitar. It's like one person. [Jonathan] He had something that no one ever heard before. When Korn came out, I was like, "What in the fuck is this?" We hear all the time that he's a genius at what he does. I couldn't recognize that, you know. Well, partly because of the type of music they play. ♪ Are you ready? ♪ ♪ metal music ♪ [Brian] Big as Korn was, I would still be callin' my dad. "Dad, my album went number one." He's like, "What? That's great." Backstreet Boys number two, NSYNC three, Britney Spears four, and I'm like, "How are we..." I almost thought it was like, "Are we... Is this conspiracy? Are we gettin' punked or somethin'?" It was a blur because not only were we partying every night... A-and you know, we're at city, city, city, city. So it just becomes like, "Do you remember that tour?" Not even that night. It's like the, the ultimate way of everything you could ever want. It was fuckin' amazing. You don't have to wake up and go to work in the morning. None of that shit. It's just having fun. And plus, I had a life. I didn't, I wasn't... I didn't party or do anything when I was growing up. I was the outcast kid. Everyone thought I was a fag and shit. So I didn't have... I didn't get to do any of that shit.

[crowd cheering] [bell ringing] [Brian] I had everything. I had to make people believe that I was happy when I had everything. When on you're on TV every day, when you have the checks rollin' in, when you have sold out arena shows, it's like... They're like, "Oh, man, you have it all." "Man, you're like the..." "You see Brian, he's doin' so good." "See the Korn guys, they're doin' so good, they have..." "Man." I had to play that role. That everyone thought I had everything, so I had to act like... I was happy and things were okay. And my dad, I guess I wanted to show him that I can make it on my own and, and be okay and... My mom, I didn't want to worry, so... So I just... It was just... I lived a lie. [indistinct chatter] I'm gonna get you, pancake. I'm gonna get you, dirty bag. Yeah, yeah, yeah! You and me, pancake, you and me. Yeah. Hi. How's it goin'? Check her out sideways.

You knocked over my beer. Yes, yes, yes! Oh, fuck you. The alcohol, like every day. Not just a couple of drinks a couple of times a week with some friends, like every day. There goes, there goes...

[male #1] Encore. - You got some? - Encore. - You got some? - Xanax? - Smells good. - It does, doesn't it? We should put it in a handkerchief and we'll huff it. There was no sense of any responsibility, I think. That's what it was and, uh, it just enables us it enables you to just act however you want. [screaming] [humming] Let's start the set.

It's like, this little baby, this, a miracle came into the world and I was there when she came into the world. I was there. [Rebekah] She is cute, huh? [indistinct chatter] [Brian] I was totally just in love with the whole experience and the, and the baby and everything but when I got home, it was like... There was like a fear that came on me, like, "Oh, my gosh. This is, this is a big deal. There's like another person that lives here now and I'm responsible for this person." So I'm just like, I was frightened and my wife came and she's like, "Are you in there? What are you doin'?

I'm a new person, I'm gonna be a great dad, I didn't drink and I stopped smoking. [indistinct chatter] And I was kind of bragging to my guys. I was like, "My life changed." And the next thing you know, they're like, "Hey, let's go watch Rage Against The Machine." Let's get some beers." And I was like... "Hm, I'll just have a couple of beers." What I was afraid of... I was just like... I was just stepping right back into those same patterns. [Phil] We knew something was wrong with him, but we weren't smart enough to figure it was drugs. [Maryellen] And he was a master at hiding it, but I should have known when... I mean, I feel guilty about that. When I... Hindsight is always better, but I should've seen the signs. I, I should have too. But we, we didn't see him that often. In our defense, we didn't see him that often and when we did, he was flitting. You know how he is. He's just... And he would crash when he'd come home a lot. And I think part of that was... what he was ingesting. [Jennea] Mm. I wanna say that... there is hope and... that, like, life doesn't have to... be just a drag. No one is on Earth just because... Like, there is, there is a purpose for everyone being alive.

"Blind" by Korn The day of the concert was great. I was clean for a while. It felt good. There was no drugs in my system. I was excited and everything. "Blind" by Korn We had an awesome slot. We went on, like, right when it got dark. So, we had the, like, the lights, we had the, the sound, we had everything. And, you know... it just crushed. "Blind" by Korn [screaming] [Brian] Ended up drinkin', ended up snorting coke. Me and my wife might have even took ecstasy. Got on the chartered jet home with Ice Cube and Limp Bizkit and Korn and people snorting Tylenol Pm to try to get to sleep 'cause they couldn't sleep the night before 'cause of the coke. And I was just trying to take care of the baby and... Yeah, Rebekah, she went off in the deep end and drank more and more and got psychotic and ended up attacking me and I ended up punchin' her in the face and... split her nose open. Blood went everywhere and... she ended up passing out on the marble floor. My daughter in the next room sleepin', my wife on the floor bloody and, and me, uh... just bawled up, just... crying.

I couldn't believe it was happening to me.

A lot of people watched Jennea over the years. A lot. Oh, look, Jennea, there's... [Phil] When they moved to Bakersfield, we would watch her and this other couple came with 'em and they took care of Jennea. - When he was out on the road. - Yeah. [Jennea] When I think about home, I think about the one in Bakersfield. It was a big house. Britney Spears! [laughing] We had, like, a crazy, like, a huge pool with, like, a bridge over it and I had a huge Hello Kitty themed room and I never slept in it. I always s-slept on the couch o-or the guest room. [Brian] Hey, did I scare you guys? To be honest, I didn't know what family was. I just thought it was a word that meant people who were related to each other. I didn't think it meant anything else. I'm still figuring it out. [female #1] Go, Jennea! Woohoo! [Brian] She's up on the blocks. Standin' on her blocks. - Take your mark! - She took her mark. [alarm beeps] [Brian] There she goes.

[sobs] Sorry, I need a... Daddy, I'm... I'mma got two medals. [Phil] Okay. B-blow your daddy a kiss. All t-the other kids had their mom and dad come to, like, their graduation or whatever or, like, Mother's Day or Father's Day. Um... Sometimes, my dad couldn't make it or m-my mom was never there. It was definitely hard and people would wonder, like, "H-how come your mom's not here?" I think I remember just saying like, "Oh, my dad's a rock star. He's, h-he's away. H's gone." I think I was like, I don't think I can change us, this is life. But I knew that, like... Sorry. [Brian] Everything in me wanted to do the right things for her and... But I just, I think deep down inside of me, I-I knew I was incapable... of... being what she needed and deserved. I get a gulp, like, in my throat and, like, my heart skips a beat when I come down this road... because... pure evil... was... in my life as I traveled these roads. Had drug dealers come to the house, bring me stuff and, uh, a lot of emotions when I come... when I come here, you know. [Doug] Brian would play shows and he'd leave me passes at the, uh, at the box office. Have an all-access pass, I'd show up with a sack of dope and, and we'd use and get high. I'd bring the meth to him. Um... And that went on for a few years. I'd pop in with a sack. And then I didn't hear from him after that. [crowd clamoring] [crowd cheering] [Brian] I couldn't stop bein'... bad to my body. I couldn't stop these addictions. They would always come back. [Brian] The thing about meth, it just like... It takes you down these roads where you can... be someone that you're not. One was awesome. You know, I'd go off and just for hours and work with music. It wasn't defiled, it wasn't... It just felt pure. And the other was... the sexual perversion. It seemed like millions of different videos, different categories just turned on by the sickness of it. It was, it was like I had become an animal. Fifteen years. [interviewer] You just decided to get clean. - I stopped everything. - Cold turkey? Mm-hmm. I was crazy for a year, but nothing'. No AA, no fucking God, no bullshit. 'Cause everybody's gotta replace it and all I did was replace it with music. [interviewer] So what was it like a few years later when you're watchin' Munky and Regi and-- It was fuckin' entertaining as hell. I mean, you gotta look at it. I'm in a rock band. I'm gonna be around drugs and alcohol 24-7. So you got either fuckin'... You could be a dry drunk, you could be pissed, and be... 'Cause I've seen other guys that had done that and they're just miserable, 'cause they can't drink or you just gotta embrace it, so... I was out there makin' their drinks, choppin' lines, rolling joints, doin' everything. It just... I think I was more addicted to the... uh, ritual of doin' drugs and drinking than I was actually partaking in it. 'Cause my hangovers would get so bad, I couldn't even play sometimes, so... Um, it was fun. I'd wake up in the morning and they'd be all hungover and I'd be... laughin', watchin' 'em do it again. [Regi] I was downstream in the gutter too. I guess more and more every day just hittin' more bottom even though we're a successful band. You're just goin', what is this? The balance starts to kind of tip the other way where it's like, I feel like shit because I-I did too much of this, we partied too hard and then your dreams kind of startin' to fade away in the distance. I remember I was on a Korn tour. I was on that two-year binge. [Brian] Yo, daddy. Vegas right there. All about money, money, money. And greed, greed, greed, money, money, money, greed. Jennea, she came to visit with some friends of ours that had kids too. And those people came into my room. It's really hard to say, but like, I remember one of the kids turn on the TV. Now check out daddy's suite. No girls in there though. The porno came on the TV that I was watching earlier. All the kids, like, looked at the TV and all the adults scrambled, "Give me the remote! You guys, close your eyes, close your eyes!" I felt the most intense shame. I just wanted to die, like, right then. I was just, like, mortified. I was like, "Who have I become?" That I would do this to myself, to my body, to my home, to my daughter? But I was stuck. I'd sunk so low into my secrets. I couldn't live with myself. You know, that's when I would be on my back, lookin' up sayin', "What is the meaning of life?" Like, "What, what is wrong with my life? Why can't I have it together?" - Oh, my God. What... - How's it goin', buddy? - What's up, my guy? - Thank you guys for... - Look at this guy. - Oh, my God. Oh. Dude, I haven't seen you since, like, '05. - Good to see you, bro. - You too. - Keep missin' you. - I miss you too. [Eric] I never knew the day you and I met at CoCo's and I gave you the Bible and we prayed together and you're all... Had your hoodie on, your glasses on. I never knew until I read your book that you were high as a kite that day. Yeah, I was high every day. It was like my, my Starbucks. [Brian] The coffee shop in Bakersfield where I met Eric Powers to, uh... I don't know. I just... He knew I was searching. I remember he got me a Bible and he put my name on it, you know. Whatever they... At the store, they... put my name on the Bible and so he said, "If you have any questions about all this stuff, let me know and we could talk." And he didn't push. He never pushed. And that was... I really, really liked that about him, you know, and... You know, I was like, "I can't pray and ask Jesus in my heart when I'm on drugs. I thought I had to like get off drugs and then go to church." You know, it's just, I was just out of my mind. And I had no concept of what God was like, so... This is it. I walked in. I had my hood up. Had a backpack with me with all the stuff I could tweak on if I needed whatever. Um... I just, I remember feeling that peace. I-it was weird, 'cause I went from, like, just total gutter up all night on meth and not any sleep and just, you know, trying to hide u-up here and just feelin' like... Just a feeling I never felt before, you know. Just a... There was a drawing of God to his heart. And it would go away because obviously I was on drugs, but... You know, but it was just God drawing me in. And I just checked into a hotel expecting to be there a week. I checked out in a day or two. Walking outside, lookin' at the trees and the sun and just goin'... "Why don't I feel horribly? Why am I not sleeping? Why am I not barkin' someone's head off? Why am I not in fits of rage?" Somebody told me, "God wants you to go home and clean out your house." I found a first-aid kit. I opened it and the 8-ball of crystal meth fell out of it. I dove into that... like it was the ocean. So I was like, "How do I know this is real?" Like, I was just like... I was so double-minded and just scattered 'cause of that last binge and everything. And one of the last nights I was doing drugs, I... I-I-I started grabbing my Bible. I got my Bible out again. I started reading it and flippin' the pages and it was like the scriptures were, like, goin' poppin' out at me, talkin' to things in my, in my life and I was, like, I'd shut it 'cause it'd freak me out, then I'd do it again. And I was just thinkin', I was like, "How do I know though?" Like, it just seems too crazy, like... How many people call Christians brainwashed? What if I'm gettin' brainwashed and I'm imagining all this? What if it's drugs that's makin' me think? All of a sudden, just... instant, like, eternal hug and it was a feeling of unconditional love and forgiveness and it was like God comin' in the room sayin', "I am real and I'm the father of every person on Earth." And I-I just looked up and I just said, "Father." For the first time in my life, I felt like I was home. It was like a feeling of a spiritual beauty and purity that was so beautiful that words can't express it. I'm just trying my best. The next day... I threw away all my drugs... I dropped to my knees and said... "God... did I pass the test? Am I too late? I'm yours. This is it." [male #3] The music world is buzzing. [female #2] Brian Welch AKA Head announced he was leaving Korn. Brian's former bandmates from Korn declined CNN's request for an interview. But in a statement said that Korn respects Brian's wishes and hopes he finds the happiness he's searching for. One night, I get an e-mail, a long e-mail... and I read through it and I was like, "This is crazy. Is this, is this really happening?" He's like, "Jennea, I'm quitting Korn. I-I'm gonna stay home," and I'm like... And I remember my six-year-old mind, I was like... "Wait, is that even allowed?" [Brian] I'm gonna show through my actions how much I love my fans. I'm kickin' it off next Sunday a-at Valley Bible. I'm gonna speak how I got to this place in my life. You wanna leave the band, fine. We gotta do this a way where you quietly leave and don't do all this shit, but he's like, "No, God's tellin' me to do this and God's tellin..." I'm like, I'm gonna... I fucking hate these motherfuckers, man. "God's not telling, your fucking head's telling you. Now chill the fuck out." So he drove his ass down to the radio station and just announced it right in the middle of our negotiating the deal. So I wanted to kill this motherfucker. I was on drugs in this church even couple of times, I was... I had addiction to... meth. Methamphetamine. [Phil] I think that was an act of love... for himself and his daughter. Mainly for his daughter. I came to a point, I was like, I didn't wanna live and I was just goin', "Why don't I wanna live? I got, I got the car I want, the house I want. You know, I got everything I want, don't I?" Then there's, that's how God talks to you. He's like, "No." But I got everything I want. Look at, look at my bank account. I can't even keep it all in there. "No." [chuckles] And then, um... And here I am. I'm so happy. You know, when he did, we're like it didn't matter. We're like, "Let's press on. Let's... We're gonna be even better, one guitar player, we're gonna..." And just had this attitude t-to still do it and make it. A long time, I hated his ass. I was like... This is just not cool.

[Brian] That conversation with Jennea when I told her that I was gonna, that I quit my band and I was gonna be home with her was just like... Her face just lit up and she was just, like, takin' it all in, like... Never in her life did she have a parent home. One that wasn't gonna leave. I didn't really r-remember my mom when I was younger. I... I knew she was out there, but I didn't really... I, I don't know. [Jannea] I pictured some... I don't know, some, like, dirty blond-haired, like, tall woman in, like, a cardigan and like a skirt, like a long skirt. I don't know why, like the ideal mom. But she came in her, like, miniskirt and, like, the tattoos and she's like, "Ah!" [Rebekah] I love you so much. So... So that was that. [Brian] You know, you think you're makin' the, the best choices for... for your daughter and everything and it's just like... It's just hard, man. It's just... 'Cause I was, like, following God. I was like, I wanted... I wanted to go to where I needed to be to get to my destiny in Him... and I also wanted to be a good father. But I immediately started makin' bad choices after I quit Korn. I was like, I hired a nanny. And I'm like, "Here, take care of my daughter, I'm gonna go write music." [Jonathan] That guy was fucked up on speed and of course, he's gonna naturally do that. It's... He found his thing to make him stop. So I'm sure he was gonna go 150 percent into it because he's just so fucked up on the other thing. And it's good. I-if you use religion to get off somethin' harmful, then that's... Go for it. Don't think, I just have... My problem with Christians and Christianity is their fuckin' assimilation tactics. Everybody's out to assimilate you into their fold. You know, "You're fuckin' goin' to hell and you need Jesus and..." It's just fucking irritating. Nobody wants to hear that shit. If they're lookin' for it, they'll go find it. [doorbell ringing] - I'm home. - Hi. - Hey. - Good to see you again. [Mary] I told Phil, "You know what? I need to go to church so that I understand what's happening to him." Because I don't understand how can anybody do this. How can you change so suddenly? I was really scared. Brian, pour some chips in there and we'll just put a bowl of chips on. Eventually, uh, Phil started going to church with me. And then... Because of the same reason. He was bothered by the fact that Brian, um, was so suddenly... a Christian. I spent most of my life until Brian's conversion... as kind of an agnostic. Maybe there is, maybe there isn't, I don't know. God, our Father, who art in heaven, we're so blessed to have our son here for a short visit. Uh, we miss him, he's gone a lot. We thank You for all of your blessings. Please bless this food we're about to eat. In Jesus' name, Amen. - Amen. - Amen. [Phil] I feel better about myself. I don't, I don't get his... riled up and uptight... kind of go with the flow, you know. God's in control. I woke up at, uh, at 5:20, went runnin'. The watch that Fred Durst bought me. From Limp Bizkit. I appreciate the gift, but I'm not about diamonds or money or nothin' anymore. Man, how do I pay a phone bill? In other words, living in the Holy Land will not make them holy. Hey, Jennea, get down, please. [guitar music] Alright, every time I listen to it, I cry. He was there with me when I did it. So no one can ever... Can I, can I call a bunch of friends? - No. - Please. Jennea, just give me someone you wanna call right now. Like, I said, when I was up there, I'm not afraid of nothin', man. Today proved it again. I used to be afraid! I moved to Phoenix just to get away from everything. I wanted to start over. I was like, "Jesus, I want you to be my role model. I want you to take me, do anything you want to my life." When I moved from Bakersfield, I had a few million dollars in the bank. I was off on a mission, to help the world to use that money, to change the world. And so in 2009, I lost, I lost my Beamer. I lost... It had 22-inch rims. It was like I had to relearn everything with this faith that I was living with. I got cheated out of that Christian guy. He was actually a gangster from New York. And when he did business, he'd rip people off. His family was like in the mafia type of stuff. I lost everything. I lost my house. Every company that I chose to get involved with crashed and burned within like three or four years. And I got to a point in 2009 where I was looking for quarters in my drawers to buy my daughter lunch at school. He had been physical, punching holes in walls and like screaming and like... saying like, "Eff you, God! Why did you do this to me?" I was just irresponsible for Jennea. You just give me somethin', just give me somethin'. I open my bible and I land on the scripture, like if you have food and clothing, be content with that. I'm like, "Dang it!" I wasn't scared. I was more... sad. And my spirit's fighting to live in faith. So it was like a baby, you know. You take away the bottle, all of a sudden, the baby... I guess I didn't understand why he did those things. I end up puttin' down my first Christian record, I start a label and I'm like, "I'm gonna get a Christian band signed and I'm gonna get the word out there. Finally, God, after all that stuff." The record company... [Brian] You know, it took a couple of years to untangle the web of just knots and it was just like a, a world of, like, negativity that was just... tryin' to hold on to you for dear life, that was just tryin' to bring me down, but I was in Nashville startin' a new life. [Jennea] It was like a different planet. It was almost like a fresh start. I assumed things were gonna be different. But I realized that it was... it was hard letting go... of friends and what-not, so that made it harder to accept that the change was good. [Brian] She just couldn't connect with anybody and... and it just got worse from then on and... she just became more withdrawn and... [Jennea] Of course, a lot of things did affect me. Like, my mom being gone and my dad not being the most... emotionally-dependable. Her life was so unlike... every other girl in this neighborhood that it was hard for her to relate to those girls and for those girls to relate to her. So that brings about insecurities, doubt, fear. It's hard bein' a young girl. I can only imagine how hard it is bein' a young girl of a single dad on the road on tour. [Brian] Things got worse for her. So why don't I try takin' her on the road? She would do her homework at like 3 a.m. some nights and just we'd crash at, like, 4. We are in a van. People offered her drugs a couple of times. It was just like... I can't win. [Jennea] Life was awful. I didn't wanna feel this way, but I did. And so I tried other things that I felt like would feel better and would help. But it, like, made it worse. It sunk back. The truth was that I was hurting. And that I didn't know why, and I wanted someone to help me. [Christi] He called me one day and I remember his voice. There was determination, fear and love, all combined. And basically, he was, he was asking for help and guidance, uh, with his daughter. I've made a mess out of my life. Um, I'm reborn. My daughter is... is lost in this world that I've created for her. Well, I think it was the shock value. - I really do. - Right. And she was trying to cover the pain and the vulnerability with the, the shock and the hardness and the rock and roll and, you know... [Brian] I went from like one of the biggest rock stars to... an out-of-work single dad. I've always struggled with anger even after I became a Christian and I wasn't... a perfect father by any means. [Jennea] I almost mimicked my dad. Like, I, I got physical. I flipped tables. [Brian] I would have bursts of rage with her, just with life, because I was stressed out tryin' to hold on to faith. I guess I kind of learned that he did to take off frustration, I picked up too. Because I didn't know of any other way. [Brian] We were home after a tour and she was just like, we were fighting and I was blowin' up. I ransacked the house. I screamed, "Eff you!" "Eff you! I effin' hate you!" She just started fallin'... fallin' down a deeper hole from then on to, uh, you know, depression... suicidal thoughts, sayin' suggestive things that no father wants their teenage daughter to say online for everyone to read. [Christi] I told him we need to have a plan and, and we need a nuclear button. The nuclear option was to find a facility that Jennea could go to and live in and learn life skills with loving people and peers around her. [Brian] One day she got so mad... she says, "I cut myself because of you" and starts bursting into tears. [Christi] Puberty, social media experimentation, discovering who she was without having any consistent friends her age around. I mean, she was freefalling. [Jennea] I just wanted someone to realize I'm hurting. I'm here, I'm, I am aching. What do I do? It's gonna be tough because Jennea's still gonna be on tour with you. We can do Skype sessions. And we can do it once a week. But basically, it's going to be like... small cups of water we're trying to get out of the sinking boat when buckets of water are just being poured in. [Jennea] I just got out of the shower and I looked at myself and I just started crying and I was bawling. And I said, "I effin' hate you. You're a whore." I had heard if you drink enough soap, it would kill you. And so I drink a bunch of soap and... Sorry, I need a... She's like, "I hate you. I hate you and I hate my life. I wanna die." [Christi] And all of it was hitting the ground with her at one time. We had to stop it. [Brian] And I would just be like at the point, I'm gonna just like, "Fuck you, God. Who are you? Like, why didn't you let me die from the drugs? Like, everything's goin' wrong. Like, I try all this stuff. I follow you, I give, I give to the poor. I, I... I did, I gave up everything for you. And now my daughter's cutting herself." I have, like, I can't control my rage. I'm stressed out. I have nobody that wants to come to the concerts. I'm just like fuck it all. [siren blaring] ♪ Stop in the name of love ♪ ♪ Before you break my heart ♪ [Brian] I love you so much, you know that? I really, really, really do. The camera? I'll tell the whole world. I'll get on my knees and tell you I love you, Jennea. I'll kiss your foot. [Brian] During Christmas 2012, she cut her arms from here to all the way up to here. Shoulder to wrist, both arms, while we were at my mom's and it just, like, freaked me out. That's when I set into motion to take her to Awakening Youth ran by Tiffany and Travis. She just was broken. Broken into pieces and she was just falling, and it was like, "Give your dad a hug. Goodbye." That was rough, man. [Tiffany] She's all he has. She's all he has. And so to, um... to put all that you have somewhere else... is really hard. [Phil] I cried. When he said he was gonna take her to that school and I knew, but it was the thing to do. Yeah, exactly, he had to do that. I was so sad that it had come to that point. Because when he took her to that school, it was basically an intervention. And, uh.. she flipped out, of course. [Jennea] It was weird not getting my way, if that makes sense. It was... it was humbling, of course, but it was like, "Well, she's not going to give in." That's weird. [Tiffany] I challenge them. Like I said with Brian, you're inviting me into your life. Like, you're not, this isn't a service. This isn't a... You know, I'm not just gonna, this isn't a nanny. This is, like, a life experience. We're-we're joining in this together for your daughter's benefit, for her life. [indistinct chatter] She needed a mother figure... in her life, and not that Tiffany's her mother at all, but, like, it's a female who is speaking nothing but strengthening stuff into her life. And loving her with tough love... and feminine love... all at once that she needs, you know, in order to make her a stronger person. [Tiffany] She was very confrontational in the beginning that we would try to take her mother or her father's place. There is a context, there is a mom. Uh, there was a love story. I don't think I-I can read it. You don't think... Would you like me to read it? It's okay. [clears throat] "Mom, hi. Dad told me that you have tried to contact me. I feel that it's best that we aren't in contact right now. There have been many situations in my life where I have been disappointed by you. And I think that it's best for both of us to focus on ourselves and what we have right in front of us. I'm not mad at you and I do not have hard feelings against you. I just think that this is the most beneficial option for me and you. Take care of Elanah and you and focus on being her rock in her life. Sincerely, Jennea." I am, I'm truly at peace, like, with all that. Like, I think, I think I communicated, like, what I needed to be, so... This is, uh, kind of a death-taking place but like a new life is birthing, too, and it's... If you think about birth, it's, it's always, uh, messy and painful, but then afterwards you get to hold a miracle. Being away from my dad is definitely hard. Like, you can't deny the fact that it is emotional. And even right now I think I'm gonna cry 'cause I kind of miss him, I don't wanna be away from him. But for this period of time, I cannot be... successful being with him 24-7. [Reggie] We went through guitar players and guitar players and guitar... No one's ever gonna fill that role until somebody can come that can bring it like Head did and have moves like a rock star like Head does, and have the presence that he had. All those things have to be better than what he was before anybody comes out on that stage right there. Never happened. [Munk] It was really hard. When Brian left the band, it was... all joking aside, I was devastated, I really was. Really, it was like a three-legged dog kind of hopping along the side of the freeway. That's how it felt without him there. He was just funny as Head, just... When he'd walk in the room, he'd light it up and he'd just walk across the room and not, like, think things over just like a cartoon character. I mean, that's the most thing I missed about him. Being without him on the road, I didn't have any of that. It was just like, you know, normalcy. [Brian] I was on tour with Love And Death opening for P.O.D. They had some shows at a rock festival and I was like, "Let me take Jennea to the show with you guys." Korn actually was the band headlining. I didn't let that stop me. [Jennea] All of a sudden, me and my dad were walking towards Munky's bus. Reggie goes, "We're putting you on Munk's bus right now." And it was kind of funny, I was there witnessing the whole thing and we're like, "Wow. Hope they come out huggin' and not swingin', you know." [Munk] At this point, I've been sober for a couple years and I was feeling like, you know, like I could sit down and talk with him one-on-one and have a... just a normal, catch up. I didn't care about the band, I-I didn't... Only thing I cared about is making sure I had his phone number, so we could call each other, you know. [Brian] Just asking forgiveness for everything, you know, just 'cause we've known each other so long. Kind of emotional, you know, it was crazy. [Munk] I understood. The moment I saw his face, I was like, "Wow, it all made sense." Jennea was with him reminding me that she's here with him because that's why he had to leave and-and then, that-that just stays in the back your mind when you're sitting there havin' a conversation. Then they come out laughing and that was a huge ice breaker right there. - Here we go, boys. - Does he know? - No. - Can I hang out? Dude, come on. I'm buying. - Yeah? - Yeah. [indistinct chatter] - You hear that? - Mm-hm. Brian Head Welch getting up to play "Blind" with us. Over 30,000 peeps in North Cackalacky.

[Reggie] I don't know, just one of those things that just, you just know, you know, like for some reason, it was not right for, like, eight years and then it just opened up. God opened the doors up and it was just right. God bless you. Goodnight, people, we love you! [Jennea] I could tell that there was, like he just felt... happy. ♪ instrumental music ♪ [Brian] I went home, got a phone call from Munky. He said, "Hey, we're going to start writing a record." I... He was, "I don't want to make this about you coming back, because I love to see you as my old friend and I love to be reconnected with you, so... But i-if you feel like you wanna do this, door's open, let us know." I was, like, "Well, are you gonna do it?" [indistinct chatter] [Brian] I finally flew down there to get together with them. It was instantly, like, just... a positive energy in the room. We went and ate at my parents' house, all of us. Like old friends just eating dinner together, breaking bread, you know, and... Wrote with them another month and just hung out and wrote down and... and it just got better, and better, and better. It's just, it's amazing. We hadn't hung out in a long time, so... just being able to hang out with him, I could see how he really was. Then there is no problem. He's not a preachy motherfucker at all. [Brian] All I can say is God has a plan and it could be the simple thing of grabbing these five guys together, become best friends again. Now it's, like, it's deeper. We're stronger when we're all together, for sure. And, um, I don't know what it is, but this thing has become bigger than us. [Tiffany] Okay, my life as I knew it is changing, and for a teenager, that's like catastrophic. Whereas for you and I, it's like, "Okay, this is only for a little while." [chuckles] An adult kind of wait it out. For them, it's like, "Oh, my goodness, this is this huge life-changing event..." [Tiffany] I was not for him going back to Korn. Like, if this isn't right for your daughter, if we tell you that you need to leave, then you'll leave. I'm not gonna get attached to this kid and build this relationship and, and all of this if you're gonna do something destructive or you're gonna self-destruct or, you know... And Brian very humbly said, "Absolutely, I left it once, I'll leave it again." "I left it once, I'll leave it again." [Brian] I know you're not a little girl, but we'll do something fun. - I just wanted to... - Thanks. [Brian laughs] [Jennea] He has matured amazingly. Him even managing his emotions and him learning how to talk to me and taking the time to... That's really important for me, is that he... No matter if he's in, I don't know... [sighs] Germany or some other place, he will make time for me.
