- I met someone. - What do you mean, met? - I think I might've met someone. - More realistic, more colorful. - A man? You met him at work. Is he there all the time? Like, have I seen him there? Does he hang out at that shitty coffee place with those rich guys-- - I don't know if it was the coffee place. It was somewhere I go. Hey Julian. - Hmm? - Tell me, how was your day? What did you do? Zero out of 10. I stared at a pile of important work, then it ended up just being blank pages with coffee stains. You have permission to murder me. - Like actually murder you or just fake murder you? - Fine, murder me for Mom's sake so she only has to pay for one of us. - Okay, Mom's okay, you're okay, I'm okay. - It's an okay orgy! - I don't understand how out of the three places you go you can't picture where you met this man, like you can't see him in any of them. - Brain's dumb. - Three dimensional plane. Our plane is two dimensional, and it was this process that helped us, it helped me. - How many hours of sleep do you usually get? - Depends, six. - Six hours. - Six hours and I'm fine. - I've never been fine. I slept nine hours and I still woke up dead. Did somebody introduce you to this man? Like, you don't know anyone. Okay, okay, Sunny's useless. Come on, guess, I'll give you a hint. - What is that? - Say it in speak. - Mom and Dad's house? - It was a part of me but higher than me. It controlled me, but freed me. A string was connecting me to another plane, and I could tug on it and reveal that person, and it would go around and around so beautifully. It's a loop. - And our subconscious screams at us, unanswered.

How do you feel about your problems? I want a sandwich! Why do you have so many problems? Where are you going in this life? Who are you going to meet? Where you gonna meet them? That shitty coffee place! You're really sleepy. You're really sleepy. You're sleepy. Where'd you get that shirt? Those bags look heavy. You carried 'em from the store to your car. And then you probably carried 'em from your car to here. So what I'm saying is you've carried them far enough. Take the help. You know, later your arm's gonna be sore. Your neck's gonna hurt. Your back's gonna feel like shit. What I'm telling you is you're gonna regret this. - I don't make enough decisions to have regrets. - Julian, high! I'm going out for dinner tonight to a bar and grill. David says that thai food tastes good. He says, he says they eat noodles. You're not listening to me, so I can tell you that David is really handsome and dresses so nice. Not like us. You can't hear me, but I don't think he knows how good-looking he is. David says I have a beautiful singing voice. He says that sometimes we don't have the ability to express ourselves using our own words, so we should sing other people's songs. - That's a crazy thing for someone to say. - He's gonna take me to karaoke in the city. - You don't sing. - Yeah, but he says I should try performing. Like, take the stage. I don't wanna sing in front of all those people 'cause, you know me, I get nervous to do things, but David says I should try everything once because, because he's very optimistic. - You're not gonna do that. - It's just for fun! - We don't care about fun. How you gonna get into the city? Look, let's just go to a movie. Let's just go in a dark, cold theater, where we can just be cold and unseen. - And we can wear dark sunglasses, so we can't see anything? And leave our sweaters at home so we're shivering? - Great, we can cover our eyes. - And we can sit eight rows apart from each other and get there in separate cars? - Separate theaters. - Different showtimes. - Different movies. - Hmm. I'm excited about my dinner with David. You have a beautiful singing voice. - The spirit gate is inside you. The spirit gate runs from your arm here to the tip of your small finger, a needling sensation like a heavy aching radiating up the channel toward the elbow. Calming in stereo or - How was last night? Mmm! - On a scale from zero to 10, how good do you feel right now. - Mmm, 9.5? - All right, always wanna allow a little room. We look alike, don't you think? - You're cuter than I am. - Me and David. - You have that mustache. David just has a face. He said he used to have a goatee. - Yeah, that's the only thing the Christians got back. The devil had goatee. I guess there's a similarity. You're up early, did you make coffee? - Didn't make your dumb decaf. It's the caffeine that makes you skinny, you know. - Let's not fight about coffee. - Right, with everything that's happening in the news, let's please not argue over breakfast. You didn't bring him in. - He had to go home. - Well, I saw him. - What'd you see? - What's David's last name? Where's he from? Come home for lunch. - Okay, can't. - For 20 minutes, 10. Come on, sit on my lap. I'll spin you around. What'd you guys talk about, Sunny? You talked about something. Didn't talk about anything? Come on, sit on my lap for a minute. I'll spin you around. Half-caf, half-decaf. Come on, Sunny, sit on my lap! Just for a minute, come on! Just get on, come on! Sunny! - David's coming over for dinner tonight! Around six! - If a person can have feelings, then a couch can have feelings, a desk can have feelings, a book can have feelings, a chair can have feelings, a telephone can have feelings, a television can have feelings. If a person can have feelings, then a couch can have feelings, a desk can have feelings, a book can have feelings, a chair can have feelings, a telephone can have feelings, a television can have feelings.

If a person can have feelings, then a couch can have feelings, a desk can have feelings, a book can have feelings, a chair can have feelings, a telephone can have feelings, a book can have feelings, a television can have feelings. A chair can have feelings, a telephone can. - Girl! Girl, Lily! Lily! Open your door! He's coming at six, I need to talk to you. - Identical things can move and change, in extremely, even though they are exactly the same, and they cannot be held up. The change can be good. The future is caused by the past, and when you think about-- - Julian, I know you always cook dinner. I have no excuse, really, coming into your apartment, cooking. But so I guess you'd appreciate the gesture. Both sprout from Europe. - Now if was just me, I'd probably skip dinner. I'd probably start dinner and then in the middle I'd just quit. I usually don't need to eat. I heard people say quitters never win, but I don't need to win. What could I want, what could I hope to win? This is jut a simple dinner, and I'm happy to cook it. Was I right, though? Do you appreciate the gesture, or have I crossed some line, some code, some Julian and Sunny secret code? I don't have any sisters or brothers. I'm an orphan, basically. And a dropout. - It's fun. We make our own fun. - Doesn't sound like your mother is having much fun. I don't mean that in any sort of harsh way towards your mother. Maybe she was having fun. She's not here to say. - Okay, we don't care about fun and not needing to eat, that's stupid. There's nothing to say about Mom. - Sounds like you guys got up to a lot of trouble. Go ahead, close your eyes. - You know, I'd love just one pill, takes care of all my meals. Simple, efficient, I don't need to taste anything. - This is different. Don't go away, it's the way it mustbe, but why should you not try what you so often wanted. - I don't wanna try. - No, when you're out to learn how to drive, how to swim, how to play the clarinet, you do not want to try. Your resistance ever could blame you. - Isn't that better? I kept losing my thoughts. Everything I wanted to say would just disappear. With the television, I'm one of those one thing at a time people. I love the feeling of focus. I can just focus on one thing for hours. - We have attention deficit disorder, me and Julian both. - We're both fine. - Wish I could've seen that house, it sounds beautiful. I grew up in the city, lonely. People think it's insightful to say it's a small world. I think it's a big world, no one knows anyone. There was this woman, I'd see her all over the city, the coffee place, the subway stop, walking down the street. A stranger. She had this very straight brown hair parted down the middle and a long sort of Roman nose. Once, even in a bar I'd never been to, my first time there, she was just sitting on a stool, but I didn't think, what a small world. I thought, it's probably not the same woman, but a version of a woman, the city woman, plain and pretty. I see them everywhere because they see each other everywhere, and then they can't help but become each other, 'cause of influence. I'm bad at faces, though. - What is this? - Just a recipe I found. - Recipe. - It's good, Julian, eat it. - Have you heard anything like Sunny's voice. Reminds me of a singer. - Which one? - It doesn't matter, I don't think. - Just this very talented singer. She had a high voice, tremolo voice, quakey and soft. - It's a compliment. - Did you play any instruments, Julian? - No. Could probably play the drums. - What do you do? - Do my own thing. - You work from home? It's the dream, isn't it? - It's complicated work. I barely understand it. I try not to even ask. - Oh, weren't you telling me about your coworker. - Oh. It's not that interesting. - No really, I'm interested. She's one of these women who sticks her nose in, constantly over your shoulder, right? - Yeah, yeah, that's exactly it. She just sits at her desk, crying. I can see her crying and crying. And sometimes she pretends to talk on the phone so she doesn't have to talk to anyone. I know what fake conversation sounds like. - What does it sound like? - I have absolutely no interest in this conversation! Your opinions of this coworker woman, they don't matter. I don't wanna talk about your thing. I wanna talk about my thing. - Sunny says you've been having insomnia. - I couldn't sleep. - Well, one glass of pink wine for me and... Light's out. - I'm not gonna sedate myself. You know those Renaissance painters only slept three hours a night. Look at the Renaissance. - I used to have trouble sleeping. Pressure points. Nerves are wires, they're all connected. See how I just press right here, and in response to that, your brain will ooze endorphins. No more pain, Julian. Release from tension. Pleasure. Balance. - It's working, David. - That's the spot. The spirit gate. That should set you right. But you need to relax, Julian. Just relax. - Naturally, you are hesitant. This is different, it is new. You have your way, and it is a way that works for you, so why should you want to try when it is so unfamiliar to you? - I don't wanna try. - No, when you are asked to learn how to drive, how to swim, how to play the clarinet, you did not want to try. You were resistant, and who could blame you? But now you are ready to feel comfortable in a trance, to go calmly. - I feel calm. - Nothing can heal your stomach because your stomach has been healing itself since the day you were born. You do not need to work or interrupt. Your stomach can feel warm and calm without any interference. - I know. - You have felt scared. Naturally, you have felt scared. Why wouldn't you? - Yes. - You have felt betrayed, uncertain. - Yes, so many times. - You eat poorly because it is a form of exercising. You are exercising choice. - Hmm. - You are two people. Don't let this frighten you. Let it free you. Let it liberate you. There are two yous. One you is for the fear. He is anxious and tormented. The other you is full of poise and calm. He is ready for your life. We all wake up from sleep every day. Our body does this on its own. We do not need to tell it. In a moment, when you wake, you will no longer stand in the way of your stomach's natural warmth. Your stomach will be strong and healthy because it always has been. - I have this anger, this rage. I called the Zwilling hotline. - Christine transformed me. She watched me through a dark time that I can finally say is over. The abuse that I suffered, the memories linger. And you come to have a relationship with the memories. You bond with them because they reinforce feelings of worthlessness. Feelings that, for some reason, you wanna hold on to. - I saw you on TV. - Sorry? - Zwilling. - What is that? - A hotline on television, I saw you. Tell me what it is. - It's not me. - Do you know David? - I said it's not me. - What's David doing to Sunny? - Sunny's your sister? - I know that. - I'm not on TV. I live here. - Okay. I saw you on TV, though. - Eastern philosophy has provided us with the helpful wood versus snake analogy. A man walks along a road, sees what he believes to be a snake. The man yells, "snake!" However, upon arriving at the end of the road, he is relieved as he discovers that what he's seeing is not a snake, but a piece of wood. As we get older, our reactions in the present are actually just reactions to past memories. The present plays a very small part in our behavior. Every experience we encounter is something we normally create inside our heads. We do not experience reality directly. Perception is projection. Perception is projection. What we perceive to be true in interaction with others. Perception is projection. Can I remember the sound from another's voice. What color is the real lethal weapon? Perception is projection. What you perceive to be true, you'll project on to others. Nothing can heal your stomach because your stomach has been healing itself since the day you were born. - Have you noticed that you can't open your eyes? Have you noticed that you can't open your eyes? Have you noticed that you can't open your eyes? Have you noticed that you can't open your eyes? - Within me is a peacefulness that will never again be disturbed. Breathing in, I calm down the anger. Breathing out, I smile with acceptance. Within me is a peacefulness that will never again be disturbed. Breathing in, I calm down the anger. Breathing out, I smile with acceptance. I avoid pleasure. I seek pleasure and avoid pain. I seek pain, I avoid pleasure. I seek pleasure, I avoid pain. I seek pleasure, I avoid pleasure. I seek pleasure, I avoid pain. I seek pain, I avoid pleasure. I seek pain, I avoid pleasure. I seek pleasure, I avoid pain. I seek pain, I avoid pleasure. I seek pleasure, I avoid pain. - What did you do? Change all of this back. This isn't the way that it is. I don't like it like this. Like, why is, why is every-- - Quitting my job. And I know that 'cause it was infectious, and I know that because I feel its influence every day. - What? - I'm gonna pursue my singing career. Eat the leftovers from David's dinner! - What food is this? - Eat it, Julian. It's still good. - This is not David's dinner! - Ha ha, okay silly, silly moose. - That's goose, stupid. This is, like, rice or something. - I know that. - Well, where's all the candy, all the marshmallow shit-- - The living room was meant to be understood as a reflection of the designer's personality. - No! - There's going to be a recital. David thinks I should do a show, a singing performance, right here for all of our friends. - I'm your only friend! - A living room is for living! - Hi Julian. Just watching. You ever people-watch? You ever wonder, where's he going, what's she up to. It's not a very profound thought, I know. Like her. Who is she? That automatic behavior. How many times have you driven somewhere or walked somewhere, and not remembered where you turned or even that you did turn, but obviously you did turn because you made it. How would she feel about us watching her, how we feel about her problems. How would she feel about our problems? I can work on that spirit gate if you're having trouble sleeping. Okay. Goodnight, friend. - Fuck! Fuck! Fucking liar, real fucking liar, fuck! Sunny? David? Sunny? Sunny? David? Sunny? David? Sunny! David, Sunny? - We all wake up from sleep every day. - David, Sunny? - Our body does this on its own. We do not need to tell it. - David, Sunny, Sunny, David! - In a moment, when you wake, you will no longer stand. - David, Sunny, Sunny, Sunny! - In the way of your stomach's natural warmth. Your stomach will be strong and healthy because it always has been. - I have this anger, this rage. I called the Zwilling hotline. - Don't you disturb us. - Breathing in, I calm down the anger. Breathing out, I smile with acceptance. Within me is a peacefulness that will never again be disturbed. Breathing in, I calm down the anger. Breathing out, I smile with acceptance. Within me is a peacefulness that will never again be disturbed. Breathing in, I calm down the anger. Breathing out, I smile with acceptance. Within me is a peacefulness that will never again be disturbed. Breathing in, I calm down the anger. Breathing out, I smile with acceptance.

Within me is a peacefulness that will never again be disturbed. Breathing in, I calm down the anger. Breathing out, I smile with acceptance. Within me is a peacefulness that will never again be disturbed. Breathing in, I calm down the anger. Breathing out, I smile with acceptance. - This is you! - I seek pain, I avoid pleasure. I seek pleasure, I avoid pain-- - It doesn't sound like me. - It's your voice. You're speaking to me now in the same voice. - I avoid pleasure, I seek pleasure. I avoid-- - I'm sorry. Okay? - I'm sorry to say, I'm very sorry, but your rent is late. - Sunny puts the check in your box. She always pays on time. - I do look at my box every day, and well, since I haven't gotten it, that can't be true. - You'll get it. I'll talk to her about it later. - Look, I'm sorry to tell you, and I was hoping I wouldn't have to say this, but I know what's going on in here. - This isn't what the apartment looks like. - It's just that people can hear it from the hallway. - Hear what? - You two, what you do in here. The noises you make together. - I don't, uh-- - Maybe we'll move. - Even if you do, I still need this month's rent, so I'm just asking you to get it to me. - We're not moving, don't listen to her. - There's a $25 late fee on that check, too. - Those aren't the rules. - Look, I'm a good person. - That's not quantifiable. - There rules are that-- - Those aren't the rules, and even if those are the rules, we have $25, we have a lot of money. We have enough to pay for everybody's rent on this floor. - Just your rent, plus the 25, thank you. What a mess, goddamn it. - Move, move! Come talk, come talk! - Oh, I'm sorry, my name's Amanda. - No, it isn't. - Oh, this happens. You think I'm someone you know, but really, you've just seen me on television. I do a lot of commercials, I'm an actress. Is that narcissistic? - Okay. ♪ There's no you or me ♪ ♪ There's no you or me ♪ ♪ There's no you or me ♪ ♪ Just wait ♪ ♪ Just wait ♪ ♪ Just wait ♪ ♪ Just wait ♪ ♪ Just wait ♪ ♪ Just wait ♪ ♪ Just way ♪ ♪ Mmm ♪ ♪ Mmm ♪ ♪ Ehh ♪ ♪ Ehh ♪ ♪ Heh ♪ ♪ Heh ♪ ♪ Heh ♪ ♪ Heh ♪ ♪ Ha ♪ ♪ Wha ♪ ♪ Woo ♪ ♪ Mmm ♪ ♪ Ha ♪ ♪ Ha ♪ ♪ Hoo ♪ ♪ Ho, ho, ho, ho ♪ ♪ Ho, ho, ho, ho ♪ - To our Sunny. Sharing a gift like that is not easy. She searched deep for that performance, can't you tell? What a moment. People say live in the moment or live for the moment, either one. But you all know there is no now. It's like imagining the ocean, and then the sand, and then a third thing, a line where the water meets the grains. There is no such line. Just sand, the water. The past is real. The future is real. But this thing we call the now, the present, doesn't exist. All my words are in the past. There goes that sentence, and there goes that one. What I'm trying to say is Sunny has a newfound perspective. She has a future. To our Sunny. - To our Sunny! - What the fuck, Sunny. Don't laugh like an idiot. You sound like Mom. Do you know any of these people? - They're my friends. - Name one! Name a friend. - They're David's friends. - You don't have anyone but me. - I could, though. - You're being manipulated. You're being used. You've never had a personality, but I'm telling you, you don't need one. - My personality is interesting. It's modern. - Nobody wants us but us. We're the center of our universe, so what's the fucking problem with that? - We're sad people, I think. - Oh, because David's happy? And he tells you you could be happy if you act happy? And that you can sing and that people will love you? You're going crazy! - But I'm the baby of the family. There has to be one. - David has my face! It's the same face! You know that he does! I don't know where they found him, but they did! - No, he doesn't. - Put out your hands. Put out your hands. You think that roses will suddenly appear, and you thinK that someone you love will just walk into the room and say, "Oh, how 'bout dinner "cooked a different way tonight." But when the food's gone, Sunny, it's the same regular plate, because anything else is impossible. After the first kind words, you're willing to accept anything of this life, even your own worth. And you think it's to sing, and then you don't have to talk, or you don't have to listen, but you're the same as me. And we live our lives together because it's the only way we know how. Because we're lazy and we're stupid and we'll never be amazing or even any better than this, but we do what we know, 'cause what else is there? Life is planned! This is not about love. - How do you know we exist if we never leave the apartment? - Oh, so out there we exist? Out there we're accepted? Say David looks like me. - He doesn't. - And Lily. - Who's that? - Just say what I want you to say! Stupid baby! Look, if I see myself in everyone else, it's because my self is all there is. My self and you! My self and you! - Focus on my finger, please, Dana. I'm going to drop my finger, and you're going to remain focused on the space between your hands. Imagine your palms are like magnets, and they are pulling your hands closer together. You know magnets, Dana, that is what your palms are. Like two people with a powerful attraction, that is what your palms are, magnets, and they are being drawn, forced together. And when your hands touch, when those magnets are united, you will feel a wave of relaxation, a wave of pleasure from your hair roots to the tips of your toenails. Go ahead, close your eyes. Now stay focused on that space between your magnet palms. We are ready to begin. Pulling. Pulling. Pulling. Pulling. Pulling. Pulling. Pulling. Pulling. Pulling. Pulling. Pulling. Sleep! - It's not working. It's not working, Christine, I'm not sleeping. It's not working! - It doesn't always. - What's wrong with me? I wanna try again. Put me to sleep! Put me to sleep. Put me to sleep. Put me to sleep, put me to sleep, put me to sleep. Put me to sleep. Put me to sleep! Put me to sleep. - He's gone. What do we do now? - Put the furniture back. - Then what do we do? - Less. - They love you. He loves you. I love you. He loves her. She loves him. He loves her. I love him. He loves me. He loves her. They love each other. They love everyone. Everyone loves one another. I love her, she loves me. They love each other. She loves him. He loves her. She loves him. He loves her. They love each other.
