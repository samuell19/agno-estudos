Come back to me. Beautiful, Addie, I never wanted to leave you. Please do this one thing for me. Please find these people, Dixie and Jimmy Riggs. They're in Ransom, California. All that gold we looked for, I think it's there. Don't be saddened by death. We think it's the end of life, but really it's just the beginning. Daddy left a safety deposit box for me at the bank. That's no surprise. You two with all your secrets. Why do you say that? Well, he didn't leave it for me, did he? He asked me to visit somewhere, a desert. Mom? Do you know those people? I'm sorry you've never been able to know what plagues your mother. She is a very broken person. I tried to help her over the years, but now that time is up. Come back to me. ♪ For an abandoned memory ♪ That could've kept me company ♪ In a time of light ♪ The ghost town that's inside of me ♪ The spirits that divided me ♪ The dark and its delight ♪ I didn't mean to leave you Who are you looking for? Um, somebody called Dixie and Jimmy... Dixie and Jimmy. Do you know them? Not many people go out there. You're looking for a horse? A horse? No. They take in horses, horses nobody wants. That's real noble. Where is it? When you get to the church there, you make a left. Keep going a short way, you'll see it. The Beautiful Place, that's what it's called. - The Beautiful Place? - Yeah. Big gates, The Beautiful Place. You can't miss it. You're looking for the museum? You wanna see the horses? Follow me. You'll have to wait till I tell Dixie you're here. She likes to turn the lights on and get all prettied up. It's all part of the show. Um... What's your name? Adeline Winter. Adeline Winter? Do you know somebody called Jack Winter? We were famous, you know? Um, are you sure you don't know someone called Jack Winter? Who was that you said? The name you just said? Jack Winter, do you know him? No, no, no, no. Please, stay a little while. Dixie, you should be getting some rest. I think I made a mistake. I'm sorry that I intruded. Please, Jimmy, tell her to stay. - I could come back. - Yeah. Sorry, you caught us at a bad time. I shouldn't have intruded. You will come back, won't you? Maybe I can look at the visitors log and see if your dad was here. How did you know who he was? Just a guess. Sure make Dixie happy if you came on back, it sure would. Please. Dixie and Jimmy. They're coming to take this place from us. We have to stay, Jimmy. How will she find us? I don't know, I don't know what to do. I can't save us, I don't know how. Sure glad you came back. My father and I, we looked for gold together. Did you ever find any? No. Well, you got to keep on looking for it. That's what he said. Smart fella. He told me to find you. Well, maybe your daddy knows something we don't know. Did he actually tell you to come out here? He left me a note. A note? Yes. After he died. Oh, my Lord. You did know him. No, I didn't know your daddy at all. Do you know my mother, Betty Winter? No, I don't. Does she know you're here? Come in. I have that picture in my room. My mother gave it to me. I'm waiting for someone. You're waiting for someone? Please help me. It's gonna be okay. You have to help me. No one's coming, and we can't hang around any longer. Please, help me. What... Who are you waiting for? She won't survive leaving here, you know? She said she was waiting for someone. Aren't we all? I got it, I'll handle it. We put together a pretty big offer for you people, and an offer that might help you out with some of the strain you've been feeling from the bank. We understand it, it'll help us out of our home. We're gonna need a signature on that sale. No. It's time you folks moved off of this trailer park and into some place more respectable. Jimmy, you folks will be evicted. There's more, Addie. I have learned that this experience of death is a reflection of how we've treated others. Ma'am, we're gonna need those papers. Let's get this done. It's all right. We can do this. Don't sign that. Don't sign these. You need to leave these people alone. Go! You will be evicted and you will be sorry. Come on. Who are you? It's just, it's not right, and that's all. I have to go home now, but I'll be back, I promise. Mom? Mom, are you here? Your mother was always so fearful that I would leave her one day. I tried so hard to take her fear away. And I couldn't help her. Funny, I thought they'd be dead by now. They gave me away. I waited for them every day to come get me. But they never came. And those people that raised me, those monsters, they cared nothing for me. I don't understand. I was adopted. They're my grandparents. They don't know who you are? It's you they've been waiting for. - They're waiting for you. - I can't. Don't go back there. I couldn't take it, not now, please. It's too late. They don't know who you are. Look at me, please, look at me. They don't know who you are. Please. But I always knew they were somehow calling her. I tried so hard to convince her to go to them, but she wouldn't. Fear, I guess. I am so sorry, Addie. I knew your daddy since he was born, a long time. He set up this account years ago for you and it's at $25,000. He used to say how you wanted to open up a trapeze school one day. There's no money in that. My father worked hard for that money, and that's what he wanted. Sure. I'll take care of this. Can I help you, miss? I'd like to pay what is owed on the museum property. Say that again? I said I'd... I'd like to pay what is owed on 110 Wilde Road. Well, total owing is $48,404.53. I have 25,000. But that's not what's owing. Now I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take your good money but then you got 21 days to come up with the rest. You have 21 days, not a day more. Never knew they had family. I'm not family. Who sent you? My father. He said there was a gold mine. Not a lot of people know that. Jimmy? No, it's me, it's Adeline. Come in. It's still not too late to take up the offer. I don't wanna mess this up for you. Why are you helping us, dear? Who are you? I just don't wanna see this place taken from you. We have to stay here. I'm waiting for her to come up this driveway. I've waited so long. And if we leave, she will never find us. And I just wanted to believe a miracle could happen. Miracles can happen. I know they can. I always wanted for her to meet these people, because then she'd find out about herself. She knows her mother and father deep in her heart. She will always have a memory of them, we all do. Why don't you just leave them alone? Lady, this place will go into foreclosure. Nothing I can do about that. No, it won't. Say what you like. There's no gold buried here. Now what makes you say that? You will not get this property. Now leave before I call the police. Stay up, Adeline. Stay up. So you're all show folk. My mother has blond hair, just like you. It'd mean so much to have a family. This is my family, all of this. We collected all these pieces of wreckage. We saved every piece like treasure. They made up for everything that we couldn't save, Jimmy and me. Why did you choose to play Marilyn Monroe? People back then, they used to think of her as just a piece of flesh. But she was so much more than that. She was a bright, bright light dressed as a person, a bright beautiful lost person. Jimmy used to sing. Yeah, Jimmy was a great singer. And I would be Marilyn. It's all right. What you got there, Johnny? Did you know she does the high wire? Did she tell you? Maybe people wanna see that. I would. Well, I'll be... We need to bring the people out there, Jimmy. Up in the air on a wire, imagine it. Sure love to see you do it. I don't know if I can do it anymore. My father was always there by my side. Our memories of who we are run in our blood and through our hearts. And she remembered them. Something very bad happened to me and Jimmy. It was her light. She was there waiting for me. I could disappear into her and leave behind the person that I was. Why would you want to do that? I gave away my child, a child I loved and wanted. It broke who I was. I had to become someone else. I had a baby girl, she was so beautiful. We waited here all these years hoping she would come and find us. She would come and find me. But time ran out, and then you came. And I'm starting to remember who I was. You know the truth now, Adeline. You must act. I don't know how long she's gonna stay with us, or how long we have here. I just don't know. Where's your faith gone, Jimmy? I never lose my faith, Dixie, never. Maybe she's some sort of angel. I think God sent her. Did you ever think that? Yeah, I do. Come to The Beautiful Place. All your dreams will come true. I think she's some sort of an angel. Come to The Beautiful Place. Maybe God sent her to us. Hey, come in. Have some lemonade. Did you ever record your songs? Ah, yeah. A fella laid down some tracks one day. Could I hear some stuff? I have one of them tapes, you know, just the one. Here, you can have it. To keep? Yeah. Have a seat. You know, we can face what's gonna happen to us here me and Dixie, we can. I just want you to know how much this has meant to us, you being here. And what you're doing, especially for Dixie. You being here has made her believe in things again. We had a daughter once, I'm not sure if Dixie told you that or not. The day we let her go, we came home and cried and cried. The only thing that kept us going is she was getting fed and took care of. We were living in a damn car when that baby was born. No heating, it was freezing, I'm not even sure, we wouldn't sure if we were gonna survive or not. We thought that she might have a better chance with someone else. I had a book that my dad gave me when I was a boy. It had a lot of empty pages. He thought I might draw in it one day, and you know, I never did. - A book? - Mm-hmm. Here it is, somewhere. I pulled that old book out and I wrote her a letter, trying to tell her how I felt that day. Had to get it out. It was burning my heart. Made believe she'd read it some day. And every year after that, I'd write her another one, and another one, and another one. This is for a whole life? Yeah, my whole life too. This here is her birth certificate. It's got this address on it. That's why we tried so hard to stay here, all these years, hoping for this one piece of paper, that one day she'd show up. You're the first person I ever showed this book to. Not even Dixie knows I have it. Why did you show it to me? I always pretended I'd give it to her one day. Day dreams. Showing it to you, it comes close. If only our parents were born at the same moment we were, how much heartache would be spared. But parents and children can only go after each other, not with each other. And the distance always lies between us, which nothing but love and change. Great show. I think you will love it. Thank you. Oops, here's your ticket. Here you go. Jimmy, come here! Look! Ain't bad. Yep. Well, well, I'll be... You look beautiful. I'm headed over to the church for a bit. Oh? I got some prayers. Tell her we're waiting for her. Always do, Dixie. Always do. Who was that man I saw you with today? What man? I thought I saw a man walking beside you along the driveway over there. My imagination, probably. What did he look like? About the same height as you, had a blue shirt on, sort of a light blue color. I thought I was the only one that could see him. Not today. Not today, Adeline. Bye, Adeline. Jimmy. Jimmy. All right, ladies and gents, you are in for quite a show. Firstly, the great Dixie Riggs. Yeah, yeah. And then, as you're leaving, you get to see the girl in the air. ♪ Old Mr. Moon makes hearts everywhere ♪ Go bump bump with the magic of June ♪ When Mr. East Wind shouts overhead ♪ Then all the leaves turn yellow and red ♪ Down in the meadow corn stocks are high Thank you, thank you. Our lives are not always what we think they are. Events happen to serve a higher good. Fire! Somewhere in Jimmy's heart, there is a belief that his death will bring your mother home. He knows that you are here now. He can let go. Jimmy... This is the end for her now. Jimmy held her and it all together. They waited years hoping that daughter would show up. All this hardship, all for her. Now it's too late. I should have told them. Told them what? There's something that I must do... for you and Jimmy. I should never have listened. - But I have to go. - Now? It's important, it's very important. We'll take care of her. Don't you worry. ♪ I hold this letter in my hand ♪ A plea a petition a kind of prayer ♪ I hope it does as I have planned ♪ Losing her again is more than I can bear I should have told them. I'm sorry. I couldn't do it. Now he'll never know. Your father made this for you. Open it. Can you read it? "My dear little angel." "Dixie and me, we made a pledge today" "that we would try not to cry anymore because you are gone." "But I'm sorry that I let you down." "I hope you can forgive me." "I know I will never forgive myself." He wrote to you every day on your birthday. My dear little angel, we have been truly blessed. I'm not sure if you know this, but your beautiful little girl has come to see us. She wants to help us. You must be so proud of her. He knew. He knew it was you. He knew. ♪ Something I did not mean to say ♪ Said something I did not mean to say ♪ It all came out the wrong way ♪ Love letter, love letter ♪ Go get her, go get her ♪ Love letter, love letter ♪ Go tell her, go tell her ♪ Rain your kisses down upon me ♪ Rain your kisses down in storms ♪ And for all who'll come before me ♪ In your slowly fading forms ♪ I'm going out of my mind ♪ Will leave me standing in ♪ The rain with a letter and a prayer ♪ Whispered on the wind ♪ Come back to me ♪ Come back to me ♪ Oh baby Do you mind if I smoke? Why didn't you ever go see them? I used to drive out there sometimes. Not long after you were born, when your daddy was away. I would park my car in the town street... and just wait to see if they would drive by. Sometimes I waited all day. Did they drive by? Yes. Yes. Why didn't you go up to them? I was scared. What if they turned me away? Everything I ever taught you has led you to this moment. You should not have paid all that money. The kindness of strangers. Yes. Jimmy is with the Heavenly Father now. What greater gift to give than that to his own loss, others are changed. I don't think I can do this. We can just say hello, we don't have to tell them anything. Okay? Yeah. Okay. Okay. I knew there was something about that girl. What Jimmy would have given to see this. I think he gave it, love. I think he gave it. See? She did come up the driveway, just like you said. Why did it have to take this? Sometimes people die and they think it's the end of their lives, but really, their lives are just beginning. Their real purpose is in their love. Death is not the end for them. It's their greatest gift. That was your father. You have altered the course of the lives of others in a way that is good. Always know that. Dad? Dad? Where are you? Death is just like a dream, Addie. Dad? Every night when you close your eyes to sleep, you go there, we all see each other... and then some of us wake up. I have to go on now. I have to say goodbye.
