- Did you see that, though? Yeah. I don't know. That came out of nowhere. - Should I, should I leave this on or do you think I should turn it off? - Um, I'm not sure. - I'll leave it. Hello, ma'am. Please turn off the vehicle. - Okay. How are you today? - Good. - Have you ever been pulled over before? - No. - Okay. So you're supposed to pull off to the side of the road. - Oh, isn't it dangerous to stop on a highway though? No, it's not. That's how it's done. It's for everyone's safety, yours and everyone else's. - Okay, sorry. - Have you had anything to drink or smoke today? - No, no. It's, it's 10:45. - License and registration, please. - Okay. Um, I think maybe there was just a bit of a misunderstanding because, um, I just, I was trying to merge into your lane and, and I tried to get behind you but we were sort of matching speed. So then I just tried to, um, to merge in front of you and then- - Hey! Hey! Hands where I can see them. - I'm gonna go to the glove box, okay? Could you help me with the- - Yeah. - Thank you. - Slowly. Okay, keep the vehicle off and stay right here. - Okay. Jesus. - What did he think you were gonna do? - I don't know. Okay, here you go. - Thank you. - Okay, so for the erratic behavior, I'm issuing a citation for careless driving. The amount and payment information or on the reverse. - Okay. Um, I think maybe there was just a bit of a misunderstanding because I was just trying to merge in front of you and I saw you wave me in, so I... I really, I was just trying to follow your directions; truly. I, I waved you in? I didn't wave you in. Drive safely. - Uh... Okay. Sorry. - Yeah. - Is he gone? - Holy shit. - Jesus. Erratic behavior? - That was crazy. - Um, sorry, you were, um, you were saying about, uh, growing your own vegetables? Woo! Okay. Keys. - Yes. - Uh. Uh, doorknob. - Yeah. - Deadbolt. - Okay. - And, um, I usually get home around six. And Rose has weird hours so I don't know when she's home. And Augie, the cat, should be somewhere. - Hiding. - Yeah. And I think that's, that's it. So, um- - Okay - I have to go. - Yeah, I'm excited to get settled. Thank you for helping me. - Yeah, it's... Yeah, okay. - I, I'm sorry, by the way, about that whole thing. That was crazy. - Yeah. Thank you. - Yeah. - It was just like so out of nowhere. - Totally. - And, I mean, it's totally not your fault. It's, I'm just, I'm just like rattled or whatever. - No, I get it. Yeah, it was nuts. I mean, go to work. - Yes, yes. Okay. - Okay. - Have a good day. - Thank you. Bye. - He said he didn't wave you in? - He said he didn't wave me in and he didn't try to match speeds with me. And he was being really aggressive about it. Like, you know, everybody puts their registration in their glove box; and I'm not like a threatening person, you know, I'm a short girl with glasses. - And you believe that he intentionally tried to block you in. - Mm. I mean, he blocked me and that's a fact. Whether it's intentional or not, I don't think I should have to pay for it. - Was there anything unusual happening today? - I mean, not really. I was, I was moving in a new roommate. My, my best friend and I, um, we live together now and she found this great price on this three bedroom. So actually it's unusual that I would be on the road at that time 'cause usually I would be at work. Like, actually, I should be at work right now. Um, is any of this relevant? - Um, see, I was just seeing if there was something strange, like an emergency happening. W, what I'm trying to do here is to get a sense of the whole picture. Uh, so you were helping your friend move in, correct? - Mm-hmm. - Uh, were you partying at all or were you up late the night before? - No, I, I work during the week, so I sleep weeknights. - Okay. Okay, good. Um, how much was the ticket for? - $300. - This is your first time retaining a lawyer, right? - Yes, I have not needed one until now. - I, uh... Okay, I understand. Now this situation did not in any bodily harm or in any damage to your vehicle, is that correct? - I mean, I'm still like shaking about it because I could have gotten in an accident because of this guy's reckless driving; but, um, you know... I mean, now that I'm thinking about it, I think I'm actually still shaking. - Okay. But, but you and your friend are all right? - Yes. - Is that- - Yeah, that's correct. - See, that is the important thing here. - Okay. - Now I will say that we'd happy to take on this, but, you know, for the amount of the fine is and the fact that you're okay, the car is okay, your friend's okay, this is... It's just not worth your while for you to pursue legal action with- - Really? - With me or with one of our lawyers. - Because I- - Yeah, I, I don't want you to get taken advantage of because it's your first time hiring a lawyer. Um, I, I know that, that, you know, some would certainly take you and, and charge you a PIA. but I don't think that's right. And for something this small, I mean we're talking $300, it's, it's just not worth it. - Okay, yeah. Like I, I understand. Thank you, but it's just, uh, you know.. - Yeah I, I, I, I know it's frustrating. Uh, okay, no, you know, thanks for contacting our firm. And, um, if there's, um, anything in the future, you know what- - You okay? - Yeah. - Yeah? Good? Yes? - Yeah. All pets must be approved prior to signing the lease. - Okay. What if we say, like, we just won't say anything. And then if he ever asks or comes around, we'll just, like, pretend that we're cat sitting? Like, like it's not a, you know, permanent thing. - Right? Uh, yeah. - Uh, or we could email him and say that, like, "Oh, we're considering getting a cat," you know, and just like not tell him that we already have Augie. And then when he says yes, we're gonna pretend that we just got him, you know? - I think it would be better if we don't lie at all. - Yeah. I'm sorry, but what if he kicks us out? - Well, I think he would actually be more likely to kick us out if he finds out later that we've been lying the whole time. Okay, here: Hey, I know it's late- - Uh-huh. We have Augie. - But we have a cat named Augie. - Very friendly. - He's very friendly. - Doesn't scratch furniture, doesn't pee on stuff. - And he's housebroken. - Yes, yes. Yeah. - Um... - We're hoping- - We're hoping it's not going to be a problem for him to live with us. - Uh-huh. Yeah. - Hi. - Hey. - Hey. - How's it going? - Good. Good, I was just checking out the neighborhood. Do you guys know what the visibility's like here at night? - Uh... - 'Cause I feel like you're far from downtown, so I don't know, I feel like it'd be good. - Ooh. - Yeah, maybe. - Okay, it's not a big deal at all, but I got you guys a little something. - Aw. - They're succulents. They're super, super easy to take care of. - That's so sweet. - They're so cute. - Just, you know, a little thanks to say thank you for helping me move and everything. - Well, thank you. Geez. - Oh, yeah, Molly he was just telling me about your adventure moving in. - Yeah, that was crazy. - Yeah. - Yeah, was it just like driving in a new part of town or something? - Well, it's like I, I told you, remember? Like, I wasn't in the wrong because... I mean, it wasn't my fault because it was, it was the cop who, who blocked me in. - Yeah, he, he was out of line, like for- - Yeah. - Yes. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. I just... The important thing is you're both safe and everything. - Yeah, totally. - Totally. - Absolutely, I'm so, I'm over it. - "Sure. No problem." We're good, we're good. It's fine. - Good? - "Sure. No problem." - Oh. - See? I got this. - What, what happened? - For you. - Thanks. Mm. Mm. I think I got yours. - You got a green tea? - No, I, I got a green tea latte. - You asked for a green tea. - Did I say green tea or green tea latte? Caleb? - Green tea. - What? - Oh, you actually did say green tea. - I thought I said latte. - I'm sorry. - No, it's fine. It's just strange if I think to myself green tea latte and I say green tea instead. Hey, did you get... Did you talk to the website people about the updated template? - Yeah, I can, uh... I can do that by end of day. - Did I ever tell you about the time that I got arrested? - No. - Detained, technically speaking. At the G20 Summit? You remember the G20 Summit, right, that happened in Toronto? - Yeah. - Didn't I tell you the story? - No. - Yeah, I was there protesting against climate change. And even what? 10 years ago we had all the evidence that we needed that global warming was actually a thing. And there were all types of people there protesting for all types of topics. You have the Tibetans marching against the Chinese. You got people marching against the occupation in Afghanistan and Iraq. And... Anyway, so I'm there, I, I don't even know exactly how I start a conversation with the guy who's next to me, right? And I'm telling him that I'm there for climate change, and he's like, "Oh yeah, right on. But you know what? We need to really worry about: chem trails, because everything starts from that." Yep. So chem trails, like, you know when there's an airplane in the sky, right, and you see like a trail of smoke behind it, which is essentially the fuel that it's emitting, I guess, right? These guys are convinced that's actually some mind control gas. I kid you not. Like, they're convinced that it's mind control gas that the government is spewing over the global population to, I don't know, manipulate us into, I don't know, doing what the fuck. So yeah, it was like... As soon as he says that, 'cause I'm there, so many of us are there protesting against the legitimate, legitimate topics. And I have Mr. September 11, you know, conspiracy theorist over here, telling me that he's there for some mumbo-jumbo reasons. So as soon as he says that, I'm like, "I'm out of there." I see the global warming, you know, climate change signs, I walk over to that direction. As soon as I reached their area, I swear to God, as soon as I stepped my foot in, that's exactly the moment in which the cops started kettling in on us, right? And you probably remember that's what made headlines, and so on and so forth. So we're the group that they trapped. And they, they detain us for an entire day, I kid you not, for an entire day. They accuse us of having thrown stones and rocks, and whatever at them. But we're, you know, we're in the... like the social media age, everybody's got a phone, everybody's got a camera on that phone. There's plenty of footage and photographs to indicate that nothing of that sort of happened. Nobody had thrown anything, let alone stones and rocks. After a day, they let us go. Obviously zero charges; yeah, of course. And, and that's it. Every time I think about it, I don't know. like I fume, I fume, but I don't know if I'm more pissed off at the cops for kettling in on us or at that fucking chem trail dude for giving me a reason to move and end up where I... where we got detained. - That's insane, though. Like, they, they shouldn't be able to do that. - Who, the cops? - Yeah. - Yeah, I know. Well, that's... well, that, that's exactly it. Like, they shouldn't be able to do that, but they can and they do. And when they do do it, you know, what can you do about it? There's nothing you... There's nothing we can do about it, so... - Molly, come in. - Hey. So, um, I'm in like a bit of a, a situation. - What's up? - It's, it's kind of a long story. But I was helping my roommate move in and, um, there was, there was this cop and he was in the lane beside me, and I was merging ahead of him and he waved at me. And he... I got this ticket that I shouldn't have received. But now there's footage, so I need to go to schedule a meeting so that I can contest the ticket. - Okay. Sorry to hear that. They can't schedule it online? - The guy said that I had to go in to give them my SIN number. - Oh, was this the other morning that you took off? - Yes. Yes. Thank you so much, by the way. I really, really, really appreciate it. She's, um, she's a barista so weekends are really, really hard for her. - Turn left on Denver Street, West. In 600 meters, you will arrive at your destination. - Thanks. - Hi. - Hello. - Um, I received a ticket and I was hoping to have it removed. - Okay, what sort of citation? Parking or traffic? - Uh, traffic, I think. - Let's take a look at that and see. - There you go. - Thank you. Okay, so this is a traffic citation for careless driving? - Yes, but it was actually given to me in error, um, 'cause I was, I was just merging on the highway and there was this cop in the lane I needed to merge into, and he w, he waved me in and he didn't- Listen, it's okay. Uh, what happened doesn't matter for this point. - Okay, sorry. - It's okay. So you wanna dispute the citation, right? - Yes. Yes, I do. - Okay. Alrighty then. Just fill this in here. Can I get your driver's license and social insurance number? - Yes, sorry. - Thank you. - Social. Driver's. Perfect. Thank you. - Take this back. Okay. Here you go. So are you familiar with the process at all? - Um, I was talking to somebody over email who said I needed to, um, s, set up a meeting. - You've gone through the online process then? - Yes. Okay. All right. So it's an early resolution meeting then. So we're gonna book you in for one of those and you'll meet with the prosecutor assigned to your case and you'll try to reach some agreement to close this issue. - Cool. - Now, here's a form for you to fill out. And you'll be notified by mail of the date and location, between 3 to 10 business days. And you'll be required to bring the received documentation to the meeting. It's gonna include all your information, case number and citation number. The prosecutor will have the issuing officer's original citation note, so you'll go over the incident in more detail. - Those notes might be incorrect though, if they're from the officer, because he was the one who said he didn't wave me in. - It's okay. You don't need to explain it to me. I'm just scheduling the date and getting you into the system. - Okay, sorry. - Yeah. - Hey! You've got, Augie. - Yeah. - Aww. - He's so sweet. - He's so good. Um, I know it's late, but I was, I was thinking of making some stir fry, and I was wondering if you wanted any. - Ooh, yeah, I'd be down. - Okay, great. - That'd be great. - I'll, I'll let you know when it's ready. - Okay, cool. - Okay. I'm, uh, I'm so sorry about that. - Oh my God, no, it's totally fine. - I feel so stupid. - No. Oh my God, don't. No, it's like, it's fine. It's just like, if it touches it, I'll still eat it, just I won't actually eat the, like, meat itself. - I will never do it again. - Oh my God. - I swear. - You're so sweet. It's fine. But anyway, it's like, yeah, their birthdays are usually pretty easy to find. - And you don't feel like it's more work than just like going on a date? - Well, no, 'cause I find it saves me time. Because if I see he's a Scorpio, I just like, "I can't." I don't have the time for all the lies and manipulations, I just don't go on the date, you know? - What month is Scorpio? - Late October, November. - Hmm. - Hey. - Hi. Well, it smells good in here. - Go get some. - Yeah. Woo, I had such a funny thing happened at work today. Oh my God. - What happened? - What happened? - So like this guy, he comes in, and he wants to like sign up for eight lessons, right? And like, that's fine. But he has this, like, half off coupon- - Mm-hmm. - And we've never given off this coupon before, right? And, and I had to tell him, like, "Oh, sir, like, this coupon isn't for here, it doesn't have our name on it." Well, actually it had like another company's name on it. Yeah, I know. - It's so weird. - So I had to like tell him that, but he was like insistent saying, like, you know, we're not who we say we are and, like, we need to like honor this coupon like right now. - That's so intense. - I know, I know. And I'm just like, "Uh, I would know better where I work," you know, just like... Yeah, it was, like, is was so wild that I actually had to like take him outside and to like show him the name of our company. - No way! - That's incredible. - I know. I know, yeah. And he still didn't believe me. - Oh my God. - Mm-hmm. - That's so funny. - It was so funny. - I love this man. - I know, right? - Lightning Board offers the perfect solution to your interdepartmental and inter-industry communication needs. On an enterprise level, Lightning Board's smart sorting connects disparate departments regardless of corporate or organization structure, fostering person-to-person cross industry collaboration and cooperation. Lightning Board, communication without boundaries. - Sorry. - Yes, I think this is a really good start. I think maybe we use communication too many times. - Well, I mean, I thought it was important because it's in our slogan. - Yes, but it's also... I think we can just revisit it with some synonyms. The whole disparate departments thing really works for me. But I'm also wondering about reworking the idea of cooperation. - What about something like, um, association, collusion, alliance, joint effort? - You don't think cooperation works? - I think collaboration works because it's people to people without regard for hierarchy. - Yeah, it's like, uh, what Elon Musk said about how the factory workers should be able to talk to the president of the company if they need to, and how VPs shouldn't just talk to each other. Uh, everyone should be able to talk to whoever they need to. - Um, yeah, that's interesting. I don't know the quote. But what I mean is that cooperation can sound a bit forceful. It's a bit of a loaded term. But I think this is a really good start. Let's just keep working on it and we'll revisit it next week. - Sure. - What's next? - And just as a point of clarification, sorry, just for the action items, um, we're not moving ahead with the Elon Musk quote? - No, that's right. - Great. - I mean, we can be inspired by it but we shouldn't connect this to him. - Yeah, totally. I just thought it was interesting. - Great. So moving on to the website then. What's the status there, Dean? - Uh, yeah. So things were going really, really well, uh, but then I had to talk to the website guys because all the graphics I had done were no longer there. Uh, based off some previous meetings we had had and some changes they had made, there was a problem with the coding language, it was a JavaScript or something, um, and the pathways to the previous work don't work anymore. And the work that we had done, it doesn't work anymore. - So what does this mean? Is all that work gone? - Oh no, it all still exists, it just needs to be, uh, manually reconnected. Um... Basically they weren't made aware of some architecture changes we made on our end. - Sorry. - Well, how did we miss that? Why wouldn't we notify them of the changes? - Oh, we did. Uh, Molly sent them an email. - Hmm? - I, I talked to you about it the other day, - Right. Just, uh, just one sec. Um. Okay, so, um, I'm just gonna have to send that right now because somehow it got missed. Um, I'm so sorry. - That's unfortunate. - Yeah, I, I, I don't know how this happened, but, um, I'm working on it. - Okay, we're gonna have to get that fixed right away. - Yup, yup. Absolutely. - Hi. - Hey, um, what's up? Sorry, I was at work. - Yeah, I figured. That's why I texted. - Um, so what's going on? - Uh, yeah, I've got this important looking letter here for you. It has important written right on the subtext. - Ugh, who's, who's from? - Court services. - Oh, okay. Yeah. - Yeah, I thought you might have jury duty or something, 'cause they can get you if you don't respond to those. - Yeah, no, no, no. It's not jury duty, I just, um... I haven't changed my address from my license. My license is still that address. - Okay. - Um, do you think you could maybe send it to me or mail it to me or something? - Um, I don't know. You still have some stuff here, if you wanna pick it up. - Yeah, yeah, that's totally cool. I can, I can come to you. Um... Does this weekend work for you? - Yeah, we can figure it out. - Great. Cool. - Uh, so what's it's for. - Oh, it's nothing. It's just, um, I have to talk to this court person about this thing that I'm sort of involved with, but I'll tell you about it, um, when I see you this weekend. - Okay, cool. - Cool. - [Michael How are you? How are you? - Good. I'm good, I'm good. How are you? - Yeah, I'm good. - Cool. Well, um, I have to go, but thanks. Thank you so much. I'll, I'll keep you posted. Okay? - Okay. I'll see you later. - Okay. Bye. - Bye. - Hey. - Hey. - Come on in. - Thanks. - Yeah, they changed the key code, so... - For, um, safety reasons? - Yeah. I told them you were going to come by today so that, you know, you might try and steal something. Anyway, I'm going to go get your letter. - Okay. So you're planning on staying here then? - Yeah. Um, it's actually a pretty good size just for one person, so... Uh, yeah, you should take all this 'cause I don't want it. - Oh, thank you. - Um... Yeah, sorry, so it, you know, came into my house and it said important on it and so I just opened it without thinking, but... Um. - Ey? - But, yeah, what is it for? 'Cause in the letter it just says that you have to meet with someone. - Yeah, it's just a stupid thing. I was merging on the 401 and there was this cop who wouldn't let me in, and then he pulled me over and gave me a ticket for careless driving; and so now I have to meet with him and he only meets during my work hours, which sucks. - Yeah, no, that'll get you. - But I literally did nothing wrong. It was a very safe merge. But it's so frustrating because there's nothing I can say to trump this guys, "You are an unsafe driver." Like, I have no power in this. - This was in the CRV, probably? - Yeah. - It does have some pretty bad blind spots, like if you're emerging, right? - Not really? - No, all cars do, um, like back where the mirrors don't reach. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it was never an issue of blind spots at all because I could see him the whole time, that's how I could tell that he wasn't letting me in. - Yeah. - It really doesn't have bad blind spots. I just think that you never knew how to drive this car. - Okay. - Why did you ask about, um, jury duty if you'd open this already, on the phone? - What do you mean? - On the phone you asked, "Are you going for jury duty?" and I said no, but you'd opened the letter already. Unless you opened it after we spoke on the phone. - No, I opened it because it came to my place and it said important on it. - Right. And then you called me and asked... Why are you lying about this? - I'm not lying about it. - Right, but- - I told you I opened it and there it is, open. - It just doesn't make sense if you opened it because it said important and then you call me because you saw obviously it has my name on it but then you pretended like you hadn't read it so you asked me if it was jury duty. But obviously you already knew that it was about a meeting. So either you lied on the phone or we had the call and then you decided to open it afterwards 'cause you wanted to commit a federal crime and you were nosy. - I don't know why you're trying to make such a big deal at this. Like, it's just... - I'm not making a big deal of it. It's just not that hard to figure out. It's, it's, fine. It's totally fine. - It's funny, it's cool. You committed a federal crime, everything's fine. - Well, if you don't want your shit coming to my place, you should change your address. - Okay. - Thank you for coming by. I'll see you later. - Okay. Okay. Bye. - So it's just like, you know, you're in the dark and like there's an instructor just like barking the orders , go, go, go. And, you know, you're just like cycling into like beat of the music and just like you feel great, and it's like- - Yeah, I know. I'm, I'm also not happy about it, but it's really not my fault. And it doesn't really matter anyway because I'm setting up a meeting to talk to a guy who's gonna deal with everything. No, I didn't hit anything. I know. I know you're worried. And that's why I shouldn't have told you anything at all because this is... You always get like this. So everything's fine. Um, I have to go. Okay. Bye. - Yeah. And, you know, your body just feels so good after. - Yeah. Maybe I should go... Maybe I should try it again. I feel like the first time... What'd she say? - Uh, I was born at 6:24 AM. - Woo. Okay, great. - That's so early. - Poor mom. - Poor mon. - Okay, um, okay, so your rising sign is in Virgo. Um, you tend to be very shy and not very self assertive. You are super critical about how you appear to others. Even though you may think you are uninteresting and dull, you're actually quite soft-spoken, orderly, neat and very likable. Never lazy or self-indulgent, you tend to be dedicated to your work ethic. - Ey! - Look at that! I was just saying that you work too much. - Oh really? - Yeah. - Okay, I wanna see what your moon is. - Mm-hmm. - Your moon is like who you are on the inside. - Great. - Your emotional self. Okay. It's awesome, Pisces! You have strong feelings and are extremely sensitive. It would help if you had a thicker skin. You tend to react emotionally to every situation you come across. - Ooh. - What? What is that face? No! No! Doing you think that's a bad thing. - Yeah. - I don't think that's a bad thing. I don't think... I don't know. I don't think being sensitive is a bad thing. All my exes are Pisces. - No, I understand the, the consequences of if I, if I miss my date, but what I'm asking is would it be possible to just change the date completely, um, to the weekend? Okay, but on the form there's a, a section that's, you know... I wrote down all my preferred dates and, and this is not on my preferred dates. - You need to take another day off? - Half day. Uh, I'm not sure exactly how long it's gonna be, but it's certainly not gonna take the whole day. - For the ticket? - Yes. - Molly, it's not great for morale when people are late into the office all the time. - I'm really, really sorry. I know. I, I did try to change the day. - Molly? - Yes. - Perfecto. You wanna to come with me. - Okay. - You can have seat right there. - Okay. Do you want this open or closed? - Closed is good. So then I tried to merge ahead of him and he sped up so he kept matching my speed. And then eventually he waved me in, so I merged ahead of him. And then he pulled me over and gave me a ticket. - And I see it makes no mention or note of him signaling to you in any way. - Right, which is my issue with the report. And it's also why I wanted to get the body cam footage because we'd be able to- - Right. Of course. - See the wave. - Okay. Um, I did look into that for you, and unfortunately there is no body cam footage and there's no dash cam footage either. So the way that they work is that they record over every 24 hours. So unless there's a reason that merits them transferring the footage, it gets overwritten. - It gets deleted. - Overwritten, yeah. Uh, they only really do it or keep it in the case of severity, like a shooting, or a high speed chase, or something like that. It's kind of the limitations of the technology. The good news is I'm looking at this, I'm thinking you don't have a record, it's a first offense. All things aside, I think we can get this thing knocked down to 50 bucks. How does that sound? You'll be in, you'll be out. I can print off a form right now. You pay it, you sign it, you're out the door like it never happened. - But this cop could have caused me to get into an accident. - Yeah. Um... Look, it's never, it's never desirable circumstance to be in your position, so I sympathize. And that's actually why I think it would be easiest if we resolve this way. All right, 50. All it takes is you writing the rest of it; name, address, et cetera. - Okay, but this $50 fine just seems odd to me that I would be paying anything if, you know, we're both agreeing that I was not at fault in this and that I'm not guilty in this situation. - Uh, right. Well, no, you are still paying the fine. So we're just sort of modifying it. And, and technically, yes, paying the fine does acknowledge guilt. But, uh, I mean, that's on the back of the ticket- - But I didn't do anything wrong. - In the eyes of the police officer you did. - Okay, so- - So this is a good deal. - Right. But I'm not gonna pay $50 if paying that means that it's an admission of guilt. I just won't do it because I didn't do anything wrong. I'm not guilty. - Okay. Well, I'll print off another form then. Um... But, you know, I, I would tell you... And I'm not allowed to legally tell you what to do. Um, if you're not going to go through with a guilty plea, it gets a lot more complicated and time-consuming, so we'd have to have another hearing. And then were you to hire a lawyer and if you had evidence, we would proceed to a trial. Uh, honestly, I've seen a lot of these, and it's usually in your best interest to take the deal. It's really not a lot of money. And you kind of gain the system a little bit like this because, you know, wiping out the fine altogether, it's almost impossible without very, very clear video evidence. The irony is not lost on me there. But without hard evidence, you know, it, it's, it's a monumental task to overturn a cop's testimony. - But I have a witness. - You do? - My, uh, my roommate was in the car with me. - Yeah. Right, there's... Okay. I see there's a passenger. I mean, that could do it. Uh, I just think that, you know, with the fee being as small as it is- - Hey! - Hey. - So I scheduled my hearing date for my ticket with the- - Oh, right, right, right. - Cop when you were moving in. - Yeah, yeah. - Um, so considering you're with me in the car, I have this form for you. And I was hoping that you could be my witness and just sort of come with me and tell people what happened and how you saw the cop wave me in and all that stuff. - Mm-hmm. Um, when would this be? - Um, they're gonna be sending me a letter in the mail, so I'll know soon. - Right. - And I'm totally gonna buy you like a big, beautiful bottle of wine because I know this is kind of a pain in the ass to ask, but... - Uh, I'm not super comfortable doing this, I don't think. - Um, I don't think it's gonna be like difficult or anything. I, I think it's literally just going to a place and saying, "This is what happened," and- - Yeah. - That's it. - I mean, the thing is like, I... I didn't actually see what happened. - What do you mean? - Like, I didn't see the whole cop car merging thing. You know, like, I don't have my license so I don't really know how cars merge, or how that stuff works. - Okay, but, I mean, I feel like you don't need to know how to drive to know that like, you know, cop car's in this lane and I'm over here and I'm trying to get into this lane. So- - Yeah, I mean I- - I need to be here. - I think 'cause I was moving that day, I think just like a lot of stuff was going on and- - Sure. - I was distracted and- - Sure, sure, sure. So, okay, um, what do you remember then. - From, from when like before we got pulled? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Before and also after. - Um... Well, mainly I was just like holding onto my plant 'cause we were going around that sharp turn and, like, I was just trying to make sure that didn't fall over. And then, um, the engine was running and, uh, we got pulled over and then the cop gave you a ticket. And I remember you saying that he waved you in and stuff, and he said that he didn't. - And you don't remember looking out the window and seeing a cop car? - I mean, like, I had the plant on my lap. - This plant? Okay, so it's on your lap so you can't see in front of you, but you can still, like, see in the rear view mirror, you can see things, you can look behind you and see a cop in this window over here, so... - Well, to be honest, I, I just wasn't paying attention. - But I mean, it, it was pretty hard to miss. - I just didn't see what you saw. - Yeah. - Hey, um, I was just thinking, do you remember when I asked, "Did you see that?" and you said you did? - Um- - Like right after it happened and we were waiting in the car, I asked you, "Did you see that?" and you said you did. - I don't think I said I saw it. I think I said he came out of nowhere, like maybe I just meant that I saw the sirens. Also, you know, you and I had just met so I think I was just like being nice. - But, like, if it didn't happen the way I'm saying it happened, then why would I ask, "Did you see that?" Because like if nothing happened then there'd be no reason for me to ask you, "Did you see that?" - I w, I was thinking, um... I'm really sorry. And like, I really don't want you to be resentful of me or anything. So I'd be totally down to like pay for half the fine, you know, considering that you helped me move in that day and like... You know, my ex actually got one of these and he just went in and he apologized and they gave him a way smaller fine. - But I'm not gonna pay to have people lie to me. I'm not paying for people lying to me. - But that's... I mean, that's an option at least. - Right, yeah. And, um, it's just that it's not, it's not really the money that I'm struggling with, it's more the fact that this, this police man is, is lying to me and I just kind of feel like I'm sort of on my own with it. So like maybe, I don't know, if, if you could help me out just like a little bit, it might really help me and sort of my, you know... Show that I have people behind me. - I am sorry. I, honestly, I'll pay for all of it. Like I, I just don't think it's worth us having any hard feelings between us. - No, no, no, no. Don't worry about it. It's fine. - No, but- - No, no, no. I'm sorry. - I am... Like, I am sorry. - No, it's fine. It's totally cool. Don't, don't worry about it. I'm... It's fine. - Are you sure? - Yep. Yes. Um, yeah. - Okay. - Goodnight. - Okay. Goodnight. - Head south towards St. Claire Avenue West. Head east towards St. Claire Avenue West. Head west towards St. Claire Avenue West. Head northeast towards St. Claire Avenue West. - So I received the documents in the mail about, um, scheduling my hearing. And I see that you've scheduled me for a weekday when I asked for a weekend. Yeah, it's Molly Richmond. That's R-I-C-H-M-O-N-D. Which is a weekday, and I work so I requested a weekend. But you've given me a weekday. If I, if I was lucky, I wouldn't be dealing with this. - You are practical and reserved, but very ambitious. An achiever and a hard worker, you respect success. Older looking and very serious as a youth. Things lighten up and you relax more as you mature. You are purposeful, self-willed, industrious, realistic and responsible. - Yeah, this is, this is nuts. Yeah, keep going. Keep going. - Okay, okay. - That's insane, though. - So your moon... Do you know what that is? - No. - Okay. So your moon is like your emotional, inner self, like who you truly are. - Got it. Okay. - Okay. So, oh, your moon is in Taurus, my moon is in Taurus! - Oh nice. - Yeah. - Cool. - Warmth, comfort, security, and familiar surroundings are necessary for you to feel at ease. Very loving and affectionate, you prefer a steady pattern way of life. - Yeah, this is... It's literally the way I feel. - You were born on the 9/11, or? - The 9/11. - My God! - Wow. - Wait, what time is it? - There might be a causal relationship between the location of the planets, or their location could also be the signifier of something else. - Right. Which is why then you asked me what city I was born and at what time because those two could have an impact or play a role into some of my characteristics traits. - Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I just don't think it's so crazy to find a relationship between those things, like where you were born and what time. And also, you know, like, scientists are finding out about dark matter, so there might be link there, like how the position of the planets directly affect us. - Yeah, that's really interesting. - So you're kind of saying that, that we don't have any control? - It's a theory. - Right. - You know? - Mm-hmm. - The idea that we're just like acting out the chain reaction of the big bang, you know. And if that's the case, then how does the movement of other physical bodies affect us? - Right. - So, like, how do you think, like, who decided what that effect would be? Like, you were sort of mentioning that like everyone born in November is a liar. - I mean, that's like... I was kind of generalizing and kind of joking. But yes, like, being the deceitful can be a common trait of Scorpios, which I'm sure they would all agree. But that's not the whole picture. - Right. But like, okay, so who, who decided what the effect would be based on the star pattern on any trait at all? - Well, it probably wasn't decided, but like observed. - Yeah, exactly. Yeah, like in ancient times, they first would have noticed that the moon controls the tides and things like that. - Okay, but that's like a little tricky 'cause you were talking about how you observed that Rose as an introvert, but I have never noticed that you have ever been introverted. And, I mean, like, Rose was the one who planned this party. So, you know, I could argue that I have observed the opposite even. - Yeah, I, I don't know, because like it's... Maybe it's like telling me that, you know, I have like a hard time being like extroverted, maybe I'm actually an introvert on the inside. - You're right, you're right. - No, I just... Well, I think there's also, like, an important distinction there. 'Cause it's not really just about observing people's moods, you know what I mean? And, like, given that the moon has an effect on our menstrual cycles, you know? I'm sorry. But it has an effect on her menstrual cycles and, like, it wouldn't be so crazy to then extrapolate and say it has an effect on our emotions. So it's, to me, like a tool of self-reflection in that way. - Yeah, it's a tool of self-reflection. - Yeah. - And I get the moon. - Mm-hmm. - I get the moon, I get our menstrual cycles. I get the tides. I get gravity. But really I'm sort of wondering about, like, being a Scorpio or whatever. Like, like if Rose isn't acting introverted, then how can you observe that? - She observed it herself. - Yeah, yeah. I did. - But y, you can't really be two things at once. You can think that you're introverted, but if you're acting extroverted then like... You know, thoughts aren't react, actions are real. - I mean, I think that people can be a multitude of things. - But people are, are their actions. Like, we can observe people's actions. Like you can... The stars can't see how we're feeling because we can all be feeling a lot of things at any given moment, right? But we're not our feelings 'cause, you know, the only thing that can be true is if we are one thing. And, like, in terms of our actions, you can only do one thing at a time. - I mean, think that, like, our thoughts and feelings are our actions. Like, we can, we can be thinking one thing and then doing something completely different. In fact, like, we're often doing that, all of us. - But you were sort of putting somebody else's words on, on Rose's emotions. Like somebody just like wrote something down and threw it on an app and then you sort of, you know, put an algorithm in and it said, "This is what an introvert is." and you said, "Yes, I guess that's true." Like, you didn't look at her or see anything to believe that, somebody just told you that and you believed it. - Do you need to top up? Are you okay? - I'm good, I'm good, I'm good. It's just, like, uh.. It, it's just funny that people are so, so eager to believe whatever you say about them in like a situation like this. Like, it's like your, um, your airplane chemicals, you know? Like, just 'cause people believe, it doesn't mean it's true. - Right. Well, chem trails. And I wasn't the one who belie... Anyway, long story. But, I mean, the, the difference probably is the fact that, you know, we're having fun, right? You learn things about me, I learned things about you. And not to undermine any of the stuff. - No, no. It's- - I'm just saying within a social context. - It's fine. Right. - You know? - Yeah. I also think that, like, if you believe something to be true, you can make it true by acting on that belief. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. - Yeah. - But beliefs are different than, like, you know, throwing all your responsibilities to the stars. - Yeah, actually, like, you... You, like... When we were doing the charts and stuff, like, you, you said some of them were true to you, you know? - Right. Yeah, it felt like there were a couple of things about your chart that you, that you found were insightful to an extent. - Yeah, yeah. - I saw coincidences, I didn't see fate. I mean, you were sort of... You know, you're saying that she's a Capricorn so there's nothing she can do about anything. You know what I mean? Like, like you were talking about the big bang. So, so, so we, we can all agree that we are in control of our decisions, yes? But, like, if you follow, if you follow this stuff, then you're deciding, you're deciding to let it control you and you're giving it all this power that it doesn't actually have. 'Cause like you... When you react to something, that's your decision; and th, and that's on you. 'Cause, I mean, right now your argument is... You're saying that, you know, because the stars are placed in a certain way, you don't have any choice in life. And actually, actually you do have a lot of choice in life and your choices actually... Your choices actually affect a lot of people and in a lot more ways than the stars and the moon, even. - I just, uh... Okay. I just think that that's a narrow perspective. - Well, my perspective is I'm just not seeing what you're seeing. - I should go. - Oh, okay. - Oh, so soon. - Well, it was great to see you. - Did the web track guys ever get back to you. - Yeah. They're, they're working on it. - That's strange because I checked today and there's been no changes. - It's probably because they're still working on it. - Well, I can't really do much until it's fixed. - So, um, so I go in and there he is, and, um.. Hey, how's it going? - Hey, it's, it's okay. - Sorry, jus go on. - No, it's okay. So, uh, I go up to him and I'm like, "Hey, it's Gabrielle. Great to meet you." He's like, "I guess so." I'm like, "Okay, something's weird." I'm like, "Well, I'm gonna go get a coffee," he's like, "Go ahead." So I'm like- - Hey, whose dishes are these? - Uh, oh, they're, they're mine. I just made dinner half an hour ago. - Cool, could you, uh, could you let me know when they're done? Thank you. - This is what I was talking about. Anyway, whatever. So, like, okay, so I'm like, "I don't know what's going on, either I'm late or what?" - Hi, Molly, this is Dan from court services following up on your request for a date change for your hearing. So unfortunately that change isn't possible, so it's still going to be the Thursday at 2:00 PM. The same detail that you received in the mail would apply. If you have any other questions, please- - Hi. - Hi. - What's up? - My uncle died. - Oh. - Mm-hmm. - I'm sorry to hear that. - Thank you. - So you'll want some time off? - Well, we'll the services on Friday, so... - Yes, of course, so you'll wanna to that. - Right. It's, it's really sudden, I know. So, so thank you. - Yes, it's been quite a month. - Yeah, um, I haven't really, uh, processed it all yet so that's why, why I'm not crying, so thank you. - From my perspective, you just started making fun of her beliefs and being kind of rude. So I don't know what's going on. - I told you everything is, is absolutely fine with us. - Come on, seriously, Molly. She found the plant. And things are so tense when you two are in the same room now. I'm sorry, but it's really annoying. I, I just think if it's just about the whole ticket thing, I don't think it should be a big deal. - The plant died, that's why I threw the plant out. - Molly, it, it didn't die. I just think this whole thing... Like, shouldn't you just pay the fine? - I'm not paying the fine. - Okay, well, Gabrielle did offer to pay, so- - It's not about the money. - Okay. Can you just please fix things with her. apologize or something? We all have to live together. - Everything fine. I swear I don't think I need to apologize. We're totally fine, we're cool. - Whatever disagreements you have, I just think you can still be nice to her. Like, sh, she was really upset when she found it in the garbage. - The plant died! - Okay, that one's better. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Great. Okay. So, uh, address is the same, same. And we have the same birthday. - Okay, so I can see where this is going, and we don't have time to go in circles. I'm ruling that for use of the court's time, I'll settle on a fine of $100. And now that a fine has been settled, failure to pay will result in loss of license. Any questions? - So it's divided into difference sections or houses, um, and then we're basically marking down where you are in relation to the position of the planets. So, um, you have mercury here and then Neptune and Uranus are both in Capricorn, actually. - Oh, yeah. That's cool. - Yeah, and then you just kinda keep... - Hey. - Hey. - Uh, how did it go? - It went well? - Yeah. - I won. - Oh. - Wow, that's... Congrats. - That's great. - Thank you. Yeah, I pretty much just told them everything that happened and, uh, the judge believed me, so they threw the whole thing out. - Wow. - Yeah, that's amazing. - Um, I was thinking about making stir fry tonight, and I got some tofu to try. And I think it would be fully vegetarian, if you wanted some. - Yeah, that's so nice. I would love that. Thank you. - Yeah, I'd love some. - Great. - So it's like we're here and you can like see where the planets are and stuff, right? - Mm-hmm. - So it's basically like taking a snapshot of the universe when you were born and your place in it. - Cool.
