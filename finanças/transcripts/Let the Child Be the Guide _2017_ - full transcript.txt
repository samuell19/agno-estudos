My daughter started at our local village school, and I set up my camera in the northern French town of Roubaix, in Christian Maréchal's kindergarten class, a class I chose for its faithfulness to the great woman's method. [indistinct chatter] My first impression is one of constant activity, real freedom of movement, yet also a calm in the classroom. My observations are based on Montessori's humanism and voice. "The child's way of doing things has been for us an inexhaustible fountain of revelations. We're faced with a being we should not consider a powerless being anymore. Their dignity will arise before our eyes as we consider them as the constructor of their own intelligence, the being who, guided by the inner teacher, works tirelessly and joyfully on constructing that marvel, a human being." "Children observe the things around them passionately but are particularly attracted by the actions of adults. They want to understand and imitate them. In this way, as they grow up, they become not just an adult but an adult of their environment." Seeing the children exert themselves, make big movements, repeat the same gestures over and over, I think of her main warning: Beware. A child is not a miniature adult. "When an adult knows how to do something, they always try to do it with a minimum of effort, to save time, to get someone to replace them. The opposite is true of the child. They act to develop their capabilities." "The developing child must constantly be on the move, acting, looking, thinking, reasoning. They must be active all the time." "The child has a natural irresistible tendency towards work. When I observed this phenomenon, I was surprised and incredulous, and it led me to think, to doubt, and to ponder for a long time until I was convinced." "The tendency to work is tied up with the child's nature and therefore with human nature." "We've learned another intriguing fact. Children find it very hard to concentrate on spoken words, but they have no difficulty concentrating on objects they handle. A beautiful toy, an attractive picture, a wonderful story can without doubt rouse the child's interest. But if the child may simply look or listen, their interest will be superficial and fleeting." "The skill of a human's hand is bound up with the development of their mind, and in the light of history, with the development of civilization." "The human hand expresses our thoughts, and we have left traces of our handiwork almost since we appeared on earth." Some children, like four-year-old Géraud, spend time every day exploring the classroom, for the joy of strolling, but also to learn by watching the others. "Envy is unknown to little children. They're not abashed by an older child knowing more than they do, because they sense that their turn will come when they are bigger. There is love and admiration, a true comradeship." In this class of 28 2 1/2- to 6-year-olds, I gradually discover each child's personality. Every day, I see touching little scenes, a multitude of beneficial socialization experiences. I understand why Maria Montessori continually defended the principle of large, mixed-age groups. "The higher levels of perfection of a class come through social life. The charm of social life is in the number of different types that one meets." "If we watch children without interfering, we see something apparently very strange. They do not help one another as we do. They give help only when it is necessary. This is very illuminating, because it means they intuitively respect their essential need not to be helped unnecessarily." I see on a daily basis how hard it is for us adults to not stand in for children, not advise them, and not help them do things more quickly or better, because our intentions are often good. [bells tinkle] "The child cares little about what others know. They want to learn on their own, experience the world themselves, and perceive it by their own efforts. We must let them do this, because their life will depend on their ability to act independently." By reading Maria Montessori and observing these children for days on end, I find answers to my questions. If we want to respect a child, it now seems obvious to me we must encourage independence. Otherwise, we delay their development and sap their confidence. We create dependence. Is that our wish as adults? Letting them experiment and discover their ability is proof of our confidence and love. I'm always surprised by the reaction of children to difficulties. They're determined to succeed at all costs. Not only do they accept challenges, but they redouble their efforts. They are capable of apparently difficult things. I can see that most of the time, we underestimate them. "Rhythm is an intrinsic characteristic of an individual, like the shape of their body." "The individual can't change it without suffering." Louis, who is three and a half, is fascinated by these letters. Like all children around age four, he is going through a period of sensitivity to written language. It means he can learn effortlessly and with determination. So it is a sensitive period for learning to read. If he learns later, without this natural enthusiasm, it will be harder. "The child does not learn to speak as we do a foreign language. The adult has no choice but to learn its grammar by heart and never fully masters it." "Whereas the child, until the age of seven, spontaneously absorbs the logical construction of language and the tiny differences in intonation." "There exists in the small child an unconscious mental state of a creative nature, which we've called the absorbent mind. This absorbent mind does not construct with a voluntary effort but does so according to the guidance of inner sensitivities, which we call sensitive periods, as the sensitivity is transient, lasting only until nature has done its work." I gradually came to understand the importance of these sensitive periods. They are essential. They invite us to change education paradigms, to start with a child's reality and not a program to be completed. I observe that some children, after months of passivity, start working all of a sudden and learn very quickly. We must have faith in every child, whatever their pace of development. Géraud has ample time to choose his work. Which will excite him most? "The acts arousing in the child not only interest but even enthusiasm are those which require of them the greatest exactness. The harder it is, the more enthusiastic they are." "No teacher could procure such phenomena of attention by any artifices. They evidently have an internal origin. The power of concentration shown by little children from three to four years old is only found in people of genius." By observing and thinking about spontaneous concentration, Maria Montessori laid the foundations of her educational method. "Movement is the key to keeping the child's attention. It cannot focus on one thing, as there are so many, or on words, but rather on movement, which engages them and their whole personality." Maria Montessori saw in the ability to concentrate, a century before neuroscientists proved it, the cornerstone of all learning, and more generally, of self-realization. Through her observations and experiments, she discovered that to arouse and develop concentration, children must be given the freedom to choose activities, and to repeat them as many times as they wish. "Knowledge attained is a point of departure for the child. They then begin to enjoy the repetition of the exercise, and they repeat what they've learned an indefinite number of times, with obvious satisfaction." "Just as to quench thirst it's not sufficient to sip water but to drink one's fill, the child must be able to fully satisfy their inner needs." "So it's regrettable what is done in many schools today when the teacher says to a pupil, 'No, not you, you know this already.'" For a child, concentration is a conquest. When I was filming, I tried not to disturb it. I failed. Géraud, who will not be put off by a child, by an adult, or by playtime, spends 20 minutes cutting out, thus satisfying his natural need of perfection. Will Charlie, who is intensively motivated by her work, manage to stay focused? Disturbing a child during their conquest of concentration can often cause them to abandon their task. "My particular method creates the conditions favorable to the emergence in the child of spontaneous phenomena." Whereas most often we try to provoke in them phenomena desired by the adult, we have concentrated our efforts on the study of these conditions. [chatter] Judging by my observations, these children are happy. And in this climate of freedom, they learn a lot. As for me, I wonder about the adults' place in this self-learning process. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ The first step in the integral resolution of the problem of education must not be made by the child, but by the adult educator. ♪ She must divest herself of preconceptions and change her moral attitudes.

[chatter] Without it being necessary to promise rewards or threaten punishment. Maria Montessori often stressed this point. Subject to the delusion of the most absurd procedures of ordinary education, I'd believe that to foster in the child a spirt of work and peace, it was necessary to flatter their basest sentiments, such as gluttony, vanity, or self-love, by means of some exterior reward. So I was astonished when I learned that the child who is allowed to educate themselves loses these lower instincts. In our system, the educator truly becomes what a mother should be, the guardian and protector of emerging life. She's always ready to answer and assist when necessary. She lets the life develop freely within the limits of the good. Her task is to give the child the chance to develop their inner forces and become master of themselves. ♪ ♪ [chatter] The educator must distinguish useful, productive activities from those that waste energy. [hushing] It's often said that the child must submit to the adult's will in order to develop their own. But by making them submissive and demanding obedience, we hinder the development of their will. Our aim is to cultivate the will and not to break it. [chatter] The educator's main task is to ensure the child can stabilize the wandering, passing attention by which they seem to belong less to themselves than to the objects they're drawn to. So the difficulty does not lie in finding material that can rouse their attention, but material that can maintain it. Only then can they progress and reveal the astounding results that we've obtained. The Montessori Method revolves around this essential point, the conquest of concentration. [bell chimes] The lesson is a call to attention. It presents the use of an object which, if it meets the inner needs of the child and is something that will satisfy them, will rouse the child to prolonged activity and they will want to repeat it. [bell chimes] [bell chimes] [bell chimes] [bell chimes] For the child striving to become an adult, what is really interesting and exciting is overcoming a difficulty, achieving a victory. The use of materials must lead to the satisfaction of having made progress. [bells chiming] The development of human potential must be the aim of education. When children learn by watching their peers, or an older child teaches a younger child, the educator must refrain from interfering, satisfied and certain that her discretion is the key to greater success. The exact and intimate lesson given to each child separately is the teacher's offering to the depths of the child's soul. To help the soul which is coming to life and will live by virtue of its own ethos. [chatter] The need to be the center of our attention, of our love, is in the soul of the child. When we bring something new to a child, we must devote ourselves exclusively to them. They know that for these few minutes that they alone exist and nobody else. Once they've been shown an exercise properly, the child needs no further lessons or instructions. They continue their work according to their judgment, adapting it from time to time to circumstances, just as we adults do. The real signs of children's activities are not easy to find. Ssss. We must believe in the good that lies hidden in the child and prepare ourselves to recognize it with loving concern. Only in this fashion will we assess the child correctly. Christian and I have thought a lot about the materials that stimulate children, and more generally about their spontaneous acts. It has become for me, too, a continual source of amazement and wonder. [child singing] Charlie is at real ease in her Children's House. She's very active and sometimes takes material she doesn't know how to use. Where is Charlie looking for the answer? She needs more time to understand that here she's not working to give the educator the right answer, but for herself to develop her own potential. If the lesson is not understood by the child, the educator should not let them know they've made a mistake. This might arrest for a long time this mysterious impulse to act, which constitutes the whole basis for progress.

[children shouting] ♪ The practical life and sensorial exercises are preparation for the basics: writing, reading, and maths. ♪ Every exercise in our method has an aim in itself, as well as an indirect aim to hone the child's abilities as preparation for the future. ♪ All these interlinked materials give our method cohesion. ♪ Everything we use in our schools is the result of experience, not in one country but around the world, and the choices were made by the children themselves. ♪ In the traditional school, the correction of mistakes is often humiliating and discouraging. Copying is not allowed and helping a weaker peer is considered wrong. [chatter] The pupil who helps a friend is considered guilty, as is the friend who accepts their help. This does not aid human cohesion. It leads instead to a decline in moral values. The important thing is not that the child should handle the material well but that the material has attracted their attention. They correct themselves by repeating the exercise or through the control of error inherent to our material. If the teacher interferes to correct or even congratulate them, the child's interest ends and the enchantment of correcting themselves is broken. The material replaces the educator's verbal teaching. It reveals the errors to the child using it and so provides self-directed learning. By using this material daily, the child gains self-confidence. They became aware of their potential. They could say, "I'm not perfect, I'm not strong, but I can do this. I know my strengths. I also know I can make mistakes and correct myself, so I know my path." In this series of sensorial objects designed to train the eye to perceive dimensions, the control of error is not mechanical like the stacking, but mental. The child detects the error and all the more easily as the single-color objects are only distinguishable by size. [wood clacks] With this material, the child learns to work alone on their development. The adult becomes aware of new, mysterious sensations within themselves and stands on the sidelines. They acquire a kind of humility when they notice, "This child can do so much without my assistance, without my urging them." What else can they do but observe them? For the child to grow, the adult's authority must diminish. Observation must be the point of departure and what drives the educator's reflection. Christian believes observation is an excellent way to stand back and think about his automatic reflexes, and he uses it mainly as a precious tool to monitor each child's development. Only through observation can Christian detect the children's sensitive periods. Seeing Géraud's newfound interest in language activities, Christian knows he must quickly respond to his enthusiasm and present him suitable activities. By grasping this impetus, in just two months' time, Géraud will be ready to start reading. [pronouncing letter] ♪ ♪ [match striking] ♪ ♪ [blowing] ♪ What's the greatest sign of success for an educator? To be able to say, "The children are now working as if I don't exist. I felt the opposite before. I felt I was the one teaching, the one delivering the program." But with these manifestations of their spirit, the greatest merit of the educator's contribution is that she has helped the life to achieve its creation, and that is real satisfaction. The teacher of children up to six years knows she has helped humanity in an essential period of development.

[child crying] [sobbing] [crying] The work of the child in their formative years is like that of an immigrant arriving in a new country they know nothing about, not even the language. They must make a huge effort to adapt to become actively involved in this country's life. No one can do the job of adapting for them. They have to observe, understand, remember, make judgments, and learn the language through laborious exercises and lengthy experience. [exhaling] [clapping] [laughter] What about the child, this immigrant who arrives still weak, whose organism is not yet fully developed in a very complex world in which they must adapt in no time at all? Whether born in the Stone Age, the Middle Ages, or the modern technological world, the process is the same. They will always absorb what their environment provides. They will accept everything easily, otherwise no civilization would ever advance. [children shouting] Nothing is as important for the child as feeding their hungry intelligence and opening vast fields of knowledge to their eager exploration. [rattling] [rattling] If we set about this task without any method, we're bound to fail. But the child has revealed a secret to us by which the problem can be resolved. The child must learn by their own individual activity, being given a freedom to take what they need and not be questioned in their choice. [low-pitched ring] [high-pitched ring] Nature determined the needs of man in course of development. The child indicates them by their spontaneous manifestations, by their progress, by their tranquility and happiness, by the intensity of their efforts, and the constancy of their free choices. [ringing] [Christian whispering] Alix spent her first morning standing by the window watching her mother walk away. No one disturbed her. Like Robin, Pierre, Adèle, and Antoine, she started working at her own pace. I see emerging in each child what fascinated me last year, this tension, this enthusiasm for their tasks, this joy in doing and observing, this inner freedom, the most precious asset for the future. It's important today that preconceived ideas about education be abandoned and replaced with the scientific recognition of the child's nature and the social proclamation of his rights. Each error made in their education is not only harmful to the child, it has far-reaching repercussions on society and civilization's progress. There is no Montessori Method, the great educator said, or technique to be applied. The classroom is a laboratory where one should merely observe and try hard not to interfere, break concentration, or put up obstacles, where nothing should hinder the incredible momentum in a child's self-construction. The child, in the joy of reasoning, following their instincts, exploring, works on their own enthusiastically in unfettered concentration, without fear of disturbance or criticism. This is how they construct their personality. There are other people besides me today who say that the most important part of life is not university but the first period, the period that extends from birth to six years. This period where not only intelligence is formed, the great instrument of man, but also all the psychic faculties. [bells ringing in a scale] [bell rings] When children are accustomed from earliest childhood to considering those around them as a source of help in exploring the world, they're not tempted to adopt a wary or hostile attitude towards people of different races or different religions. Later on, children raised this way will be of great help in the construction of a peaceful society. During these years of fatherhood and filming, I've grown up as much as my daughter. I've seen the incredible strength and possibilities of children when they're not hindered. I have learned to control my desire to interfere and to just trust. But this path is a daily challenge. I invite everyone to rise to it. Around me, I see violence toward children, inequality and conflict between people, the excesses of modern life, and the destruction of our planet. Maria Montessori clearly saw, in the bloody chaos of the first half of the 20th century, the revolutionary scope of the educational gesture. I believe her message is more relevant and necessary than ever. The work for this film confirmed my intuition. I should not ignore the questions raised by a ladder or swing scene. The prejudice concealed an unknown continent and essential revelations for my daughter's development and my future struggles. Maria Montessori always said that the child can do a great deal more for us than we can do for them. I saw before me the figure of the child. I didn't see a helpless little creature lying with folded arms and outstretched body in their weakness, but the child who stands before us with their arms held open, beckoning humanity to follow. And I made a promise, a vow even, to become a follower of the child as my guide. ♪ [ringing] ♪ ♪ [bubbles blowing] ♪ ♪ [bell ringing] ♪ [shouting] ♪ ♪
