- No! Let go! - Shut up, you hear me? - I'll kill you right now! Shut up! - Help! Help! Goddamn it, I'll kill you right fucking here! Let go! - Get off me! Get off! - Help! - Fuck! - Help me! - Please! - Shut up! Goddamn it, shut up! I'll blow your fucking head off right here! I'll kill you right here! Shut up! Listen to me! I want you to... - Police! Drop it! Now! - Stay back, Cop! - Stay back, or I'll blow her head off! - Help, Officer! Okay, just let her go. Just let her go, I don't want anybody to get hurt, I don't want to hurt you. Don't come any closer! Okay. Just let her go. Die, bitch! Shit! Okay, gentlemen, next victim. You killed the husband, but the wife killed you, Turner. In the field, you've got to have eyes in the back of your head. Graduating class. Attention! Ready? Move! I do hereby pledge declare... I do hereby pledge declare... that I will uphold the Constitution of the United States... that I will uphold the Constitution of the United States... and the Constitution of the State of New York... and the Constitution of the State of New York... and I will faithfully discharge the duties... and I will faithfully discharge the duties... of Police Officer in the New York City Police Department... of Police Officer in the New York City Police Department... according to the best of my ability. according to the best of my ability. Ready? Move! One second. Just one second. Thank you very much. Here we go. Excuse me, excuse me. Okay, there it goes! Oh Honey, can you take a picture, just me and Megan alone? We're going to go and take a picture of your mommy and me, okay? I can't believe it, you're a fucking cop! You're on the right side of the law. How does it feel? It feels like I need a cigarette. Megan, I'm really proud of you. I love you. Love you too, Tracy, thank you for coming. Come let's take a picture. I got a cop. - Oh, oh, oh, Megan! Look at you! - Not bad, huh? - Yeah, very... you know. - Yes. Hi, Honey. It's mom. I just wanted to say congratulations, and we're going to see you tomorrow night, I hope. Bye. - Have some more of this. - No more meat. It's so nice to have you here. Nice to be here. - Yeah, right. - Look, I give up. I guess the subways were all on strike, but, you know, I didn't read anything about it in the papers, but who's counting? Buses must have all had flats and I guess no taxis came across the river yesterday. I wanted so badly to be at the ceremony, I... - Shut up, Shirley. - Oh dad, just say it. - I have nothing to say to you. - Frank, don't. - I want to hear it. - Hear what? Now don't start. I want to have a nice meal. I got a goddamn cop for a daughter. So Turner, how come? For the action? - How come what? - You become a cop. - Ever since I was a kid. - Yeah, me too. I looked at the guys and men in blue and I thought to myself: "Nobody fucks with a cop." - Ever since you were a kid, huh? - Yeah, wanted to shoot people. No kidding? You're okay, Turner, you're okay. Turn in a minute, I got to take a leak. - Can I help you? - Yeah, two regulars. And one of these. Thank you. Come on, honey. Come on, honey, let's go. On the floor, all of you! You, give me the cash drawer, man. What, you want a grave, asshole? Hurry the fuck up! That's a dollar and fifty-seven, Ma'am. Ah, damn, shit! Open the drawer, man. Okay, calm down. Fucking cry-baby... Calm the fuck down. You think I'm some kind of fucking idiot? Where the fuck're your big bills?! Where're the C-notes?! Come on, open the fucking drawer, man. I'm not a fucking fool. You gonna fuck with me? Huh? Get me the big bills! Hurry the fuck up, man! Put your head down, you dumb fucking bitch. I'm not ordering Chinese food, fuck-face! Give me the money! That's right, the change in there, the change in there. All right! No one even fucking breathe! All right, all right. You wanted a grave, asshole? You already fucked up. Give me the bag, give me the bag. You want to play games, huh? You want to play some fucking games? You better give me that fucking change. Police! Don't move! Put the gun down! Get out of my face, baby. Put down the gun! Look, bitch, I didn't come here to fuck with you. I said put the gun down now! Oh... Fuck you! Holy shit! Jesus Christ, Turner. Fuck! - Good evening, Mr. Hunt. - Hi. 3-2, Mets. Let's go over it again. The only bullets fired were yours. You say the suspect had a gun but no weapon was found at the scene. The cashier also states the suspect had a weapon, but can't be sure what it was. When asked if it could have been a knife, the witness answered the affirmative. Chief Hoyt, I'd like to add, please. - The cashier was very upset. - Yeah, no question. The fact remains that you emptied an entire roll. You blew the fucking head off an individual who only allegedly had a gun. I suggest to you that there may have been some overreaction on your part. I've modified assignment, Officer Turner. Push pencils for a while. - You got to hear this. - Look, Nick... No, it'll just take a second, you'll piss yourself. This guy's in from Hackensack, right? It's Saturday night, he's got a hooker in the back of the cab, her head is buried in his lap, life is good, right? The taxi hits a pothole. Her head pops up. What do you think? She's still got a dick in her mouth. Okay, so the guy is bleeding all over the place, but he don't want to go nowhere, he don't want to go to a hospital because he's somebody, right? The cabbie, he's pissed off because there's blood all over his back seat. The hooker pulls out a needle and thread. Stanley, she sows his dick on backwards! I wonder what he's going to say to his wife. Officer Turner. 24 hours on the force, and she's already blown some poor slobs face off. 24 hours later, she's off the force. It was justifiable circumstances. - What did he draw on you? - Looked like a 44. - Why didn't you just tackle him? - Because he was 40 feet away. So then how could you tell if it was a 44? Because I could. - Do you mind? - Yeah. No gun found at the scene, Officer Turner, nothing on the victim. I know. I saw it. It was there, I saw it. - I saw the metal glint. - And then you drew? - No, then I fired! - He didn't shoot first? I asked him to drop the gun, he wouldn't, he swung it in my direction. - How fast? - What? Okay, look. Put that shit down. I'm him, all right? Hey, I'm just showing you something, okay? It's a comb. You know something, Turner? You'll be lucky to last 36 hours on the job. - Says who? - Detective Nicholas Mann, homicide. - I'll be seeing you. - Says who? - Sit down, just sit down! - Excuse me. - Hey Turner, your mom's here. - What? Mom! What are you doing here? Oh, I just had to come. I called you but you weren't home. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am about last week. - Do you want to get a cup of coffee? - Sure. - So this is where you work. - Yeah mom, this is where I work. You see all these other people wearing the same outfit as me? This is where I work. - It's right over there. - Look at you. What's the matter, honey? You know he loves you. Just has a hard time showing it. Does he still hit you, mom? No. No? 80! 80! 80! 80! Sold! Sold! 50 at 80! 50 at 90! 20! 20 sold! 30 at 90! 10 at 90! 10 at 90! 10 at...! Sold! Stop. Back up. Turn around. Go the other way. You seeing anybody? Nobody special. - Okay, no. Nobody. - I thought so. - I got somebody I want you to meet. - No, Tracy. - Trust me. Howard. - Tracy. Howard, this is Megan. Megan, this is Howard. - Hi. - Talk. - Nice meeting you. - I'm sorry. Megan? - You want to get a beer? - Okay. - So you're Tracy's friend, huh? - Yeah. I've known her since I was a kid. Tracy has nice friends. Thank you. - How do you know her? - I'm her CPA. - No way. - Yeah. You don't look like a CPA. Well, she has nice CPAs. Thank you. - So what do you do? - I'm a cop. - Come on. - Really. - Jenny, get off of there. Jenny. - Higher! - Are you okay? - Yeah, sure. Why? You just, you look bad. You look like you just ate something bad. A cop, huh? You wear a gun? Yeah. - You're not on duty though? - No. Can I ask you a question, just, you know, civilian to civilian? Sure. You're a good looking woman. I mean, beautiful in fact. Why would you want to become a cop? I like to slam people's heads up against walls. Well, it was nice talking to you. I really, I got to go. I got a lot of work to do. Bye. See you. Oh, wait a minute, Howard, just wait one second. - What kind of car are you driving? - Honda Civic. Why? Is it the silver one with the bashed in tail light? I was going to get that fixed, that's... You know the reason that I noticed the tail light, is because the registration is overdue on the car. Yeah, it's funny you should mention that, that's in my glove compartment. I was going to put that on this evening. I mean I really don't need a ticket if that's what you're driving at. Because I've got enough points on the license... Howard. Howard. Lighten up. Hey, what are you, fucking blind?! Hey mister, you okay? Hey, pal, that... Hey. Hey, what are you up to, buddy? Mister... Oh my God! Take it easy there, buddy. No, please! No! No! No! Please no! Unauthorized use of deadly physical force, Officer Turner. It's my recommendation that you take some time off. Excuse me sir, are you saying I'm suspended? Until further notice. Just a minute. I'll take that. And that. Taxi! You want to share? You're wet. - No, thanks. - Oh come on, it's no problem! - Miss, it's right here! - I like walking in the rain. It's nice. Hey, you remember what happened to Dorothy when she couldn't get out of the storm? Come on, it's right here. It's no problem, really it's not. Miss, I'm getting pneumonia. Where do you want to go? - Downtown? - Yes. Perfect. - "Expect rain today." - Really? Yeah. They're never right. - Hi, I'm Eugene. - Megan. Thanks for the ride. - Where are you going? - 17th and 8th? - Sure it's not in your way? - No, no. Not at all. By the way, I don't make a habit out of this. It's the nicest thing that's happened to me all day. - That good, huh? - Yeah. I don't like the rain, I prefer winter. I like it when it snows, the city gets real quiet. Everything feels still. All the noise stops. It feels like something's about to happen. I like it when it snows. It makes me feel safe. Safe. I hope you're not in a hurry. What do you say, do you want to wait out the traffic? Are you hungry? - Really? - Yeah, really. Come on. - There you go. Keep it. - Thanks, buddy. - Come on. - Sure? Yes, I'm sure. Come on. Thanks. - Good evening. - Hi. Two for dinner? This way, please. Look, maybe we should go some place else. - I don't know what I should say. - Just say no. I don't want to. Ma'am. - Thank you. - Yes, sir. This is very nice. I saw you standing there: it was pouring, you were wet, cold. You reminded me of a cat I used to have. Couldn't resist. So what gives? What gives? Hello. Nothing. Okay. I'll stop. All right. Do you like champagne? Go ahead. That's fine, thank you. Here's to meeting you. Here's to meeting you. So tell me something about you. I feel I haven't got very much to tell. I'm a trader. At the exchange. Commodities, gold futures, contracts, we buy them and sell them. It's kind of a misanthropic enterprise when you think about it. People who buy gold and they're betting that everything else in the world is going to go to hell. I don't want to talk about that. Now, the first time I laid eyes on you... This is very unusual for me, being with you here tonight, I... I'm glad you came. I'd like to get to know you better. I hope you'll let me me. Thanks very much for dinner, I had a great time. I hope I get to see you again. There's no question about that. - Goodnight, Eugene. - Goodnight, Megan. What are you doing tomorrow night? - Yes? - Are you Megan Turner? Yes. We're from Internal Affairs. We're going to have to ask you to come with us. - Can you tell me why? - Just come with us, please. Just give me a minute. This poor guy bought it on the Upper West Side tonight. If it wasn't so bold, it would be stupid. I wish all homicides were this easy. Give me an answer to this. - I have no idea. - Get an idea. - Get two ideas. - Think, Megan. Hard. Aren't there any other Megan Turners in New York? Yeah, one. Megan Augusta Turner, eighty-six years old, lives in a nursing home in the Bronx. We're checking but I'd say it's an exercise. Doesn't sound like the kind of girl that gets her name put on a bullet. I don't think of myself as the kind of girl who gets her name on a bullet either. You learn something new about yourself every day. Where were you around midnight? Sleeping. The officers woke her up, Nick. Okay. Come on, Megan, you're a pretty girl. Maybe you threw over somebody - had a violent streak. - No. - An old boyfriend or something. - No. What, no old boyfriends? Is that a personal problem? All right, how about an acquaintance? Look, I do not know anybody. I have my mom, my dad, my friend Tracy, her husband John. - Current boyfriend? - No! You know there's a chance it's not me. True. It could be Augusta, eighty-six. I mean maybe this perp's got a thing for oxygen tanks, but I doubt it. I think somebody out there likes you. This guy must know you, you don't know him. - She's our only lead. - She's suspended, remember? Not anymore. Nick, I think we should talk about this. I got bullshit other than her, boss. Could be she's a target to kill, means she pees, I got to know about it, right? I've got to position her with high visibility, minimum risk - within reason of course, and I cannot do that, if she's a civilian. Come on, Stan, you got to do me a solid here. - You take full responsibility? - Absolutely. - In your department. - Oh, Jesus. - Nick! - There's got to be some way around that. Around what? Around what? Christ. Turner. Take that. - What's this? - It's a detective shield. In name only. You know nothing, you know less than nothing. People like you get people hurt. Yeah, but I'm the one who should be worried, right? That's right. - Thank you. - Sign that. Detective Turner. I like the sound of that. How does it feel? Like it's been a hell of a week. Look. What? Me! You. Okay, what about you? Why me? Why you? It's such a stupid question, I'm sorry. I'm actually happy, I'm very happy to be here. Thanks. I feel like I'm on top of the world. You want to get higher? Look. You know, when you're way up here, looking down? People, they're just little specks. Like they don't matter much. It's just the two of us. We're the only people in the... In the world. Want to come in? Soon. Soon? Okay. You even put on pantyhose, I want to know about it. Shit! What the fuck are you doing here? How was dinner? - Fine! - Good. Mine was great too. Day-old tuna salad, no bread. You ever shop? - Nick, he works... - ... at the Exchange. Commodities, I know. - And? - And nice suits, good salary. Your mother would approve. In case you haven't figured it out yet, Turner, every aspect of your life is my business. I own you. Now you want to keep secrets, do me a favor. What's that? Shop. Hello? Where? Give me five minutes. Is this related to the other shootings? Detective! Could I get a rope around here? I really need a rope. Listen, there's too many people walking around here. Let's at least try to keep the scene fresh, okay? Megan, come here. Do you know this guy? Okay, look. Powder burns on the chest. He was shot at point blank range. Now, examine the crime scene. Looks like there was a struggle, - his briefcase is over there... - ...the body is here. So this guy might have run. Perp caught up to him, turned him around, popped him. Why? Maybe he likes them to see it coming. - Maybe. - Does it fit the pattern? Right there on the bullet casing. Shit. Come on Louis, take this guy. Friends and relatives showed up today for the funeral of the 42-year old construction worker who authorities believe may be the forth victim claimed by the 44-Magnum-killer whose identity continues to stump investigators. A police speaker has stated that a homicide task force has been formed to coordinate their efforts, but admitted that there are no leads at present. What? What? Who are you? Why are you talking to me? You... ...are a god, Eugene. You are unique, Eugene. But unto them that fear your name, shall the son of righteousness arise. With healing in his wings. You are not alone, Eugene. Stop. Stop! Stop talking to me! I can't hear you! I can't hear you! God! Want a date? Hi. Nothing? So far I have: the suspect is right-handed, wearing gloves, smooth, leather-soled shoes, uses an ordinary pen knife. That really narrows it down. Keep looking. Yeah. Only six hundred thousand more faces to look at. Every minute that you're not coming up with an idea about who knows you, somebody out there is coming a minute closer to losing their life. Fucking give me a break! Don't you think I think about that? Don't you think I think about it, for every second of every waking day? Who do you think I am? Come here! Oh, sorry. Oh no, don't be. - It's a thirty-eight, isn't it? - Not anymore. Don't. Eugene, I have to take off my gun. Don't take it off. In the morning, your face is there even before I open my eyes. I think you're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen in my life. Take it. Take out your gun and hold it. You want me to hold my gun? Both hands. Two hand grip. It's embarrassing. Hold your gun. Please. You know... You know, like... like this. Okay. That's perfect. I don't understand. I knew. I knew the first time I saw you. What? I have found my brightness. I've seen that brightness in you. My brightness? The supermarket. Eugene, I didn't meet you in a supermarket. You... You shot him without blinking an eye. I knew. You were there? You're the only one who's capable of understanding. His gun? Gave me my radiance. - Oh, God. - Megan. Just the two us... we could share... You have the right to remain silent. - Anything you say - You don't see it, do you? can and will be used against you in a court of law. Not yet... You have the right to an attorney. If you can not afford one, - the state will appoint one for you. - I know you better than you know yourself. This is Officer Turner requesting backup. 1013, Officer needs immediate assistance. 601, East 61st. Apart... The 15th floor. 1510. Apartment 1510. Also radio Detective Nick Mann. Nick Mann! Don't move! We're two halves of one person, you and I. You would do what I do if you knew yourself better. You will, in time. It's just starting between you and me. Oh yeah. It's just the beginning. Don't worry. You look... you look worried. There's no reason to worry. We've got everything to live for. I mean... death... is the greatest kick of all. It's why they save it for last. That's my jacket you're wearing there. And those are my shoes, man. That's my jacket, my shoes. My jacket, my shoes. My jacket, my shoes. What about facts? What are you teaching rookies these days? This guy's a commodities trader on the Exchange, he's got an impeccable reputation. That doesn't mean he didn't do it, counselor. What it means, my friend, is you better have a lot more than probable cause from some detective. With whom he's had relations. Uncuff my client. Why don't you listen to the charges first, Mr. Dawson? I've been as cooperative with these people as I can be. I'm getting a little tired of this. Are you the detective? I'm Detective Megan Turner. I'm the one who made the arrest. What's your evidence? Cumulative knowledge of the investigating officer. Well, what it looks like to me is that a meeting was arranged by the detective here for the sole purpose of arresting my client. And that's entrapment, Chief. En-fucking-trapment. I believe that Mr. Hunt is responsible for the recent murders going on in the city. You believe. You can lock a guy up on belief? - What is this, a joke? - No, I know. Good, good, she's good. Where did you find her? Does she read palms? The press are going to get their wet dream over this one. - Did my client tell you this? - No! Did you find the murder weapon? - No. - Then quite frankly, what you have is shit. - We stand behind our detectives. - I'd stake my badge on it. Well Detective, that's exactly what's happening. Now I want my client released this minute. And if I see anybody from this department within 15 feet of my client, I'm going to sue the New York City Police Department and the City of New York. And, Detective, you even talk to my client, you're going to direct traffic on the BQE for the rest of your career. Release him. - Were you going out with him? - Chief, this wasn't personal. Yeah, she saw him a few times. - Why didn't you mention that before? - Because I couldn't believe it was him! Well, you're in good company because nobody else seems to think so either! Now what makes you so goddamn sure he's the one? Because he said so! He didn't say it, he implied it. He said that the first time he saw me, was the night I killed the armed robber in the supermarket, but he wasn't there, Chief, he wasn't one of the fucking witnesses! He must have left the scene. He wanted to watch me hold my weapon. Chief, from the words he spoke I think he... sees me as some sort of... - kindred spirit or something. - We should keep an eye on this guy. No, Nick, you stay away from him! And that goes for you too! This guy is established here. We go near him, we're going to have my ass in a sling, we're going to have the department's ass in a sling, and we're going to have the fucking mayor's ass in a sling! See, if you'd gotten married and had kids, you'd know how to do this stuff. Yeah, but then I wouldn't be so dependent upon you. There, I boiled water. How's John? Right now, he's probably tearing his hair out. He's taking care of the kids. That's nice. Nice? You try it. No, I mean... It's nice, you and the babies, John, your life. Yeah. You too? I'm glad you're my friend, Tracy. I'm glad you're my friend too. And anyway, I'm going to cook Sunday. I'm going to cook lasagne which is my specialty. - Yeah. - John will be there, the kids will be there. You'd better show up because I invited that guy I told you about. Tracy, Tracy. Just do me one favor, okay? For the rest of my life, just one. Don't set me up. - He's a nice guy. - Give me a break, Tracy, so was the other guy. Just remember... Tracy! Run! What? Breathe deep. That's right, let's go. That's good. Keep breathing, just keep breathing. Come on, breathe. Breathe, you're coming home. Easy, easy, easy. - Take it easy. - That's it, there you go. Megan. Megan, it's Nick. - Tracy. - Easy, easy. She's gone. Come on, stand up. You all right? It was him. - I tried to stop him, Nick. - We can talk about that later. Let's just get out of here. I want her on her feet as soon as possible. No, Nick. He's going to die. He's going to die. Won't take him to trial. He's going to die. You need to get your rest, all right? - We're wasting time. - We're not going to do anything. - We have to stop him. - We've got to get you to a hospital. Now! All right, come on, let's go. You look lovely. Stand up! - Excuse me? - Stand up! Put your hands out where I can see them and turn around. Turn around! You look beautiful. I like your bone structure. Have you been thinking of me? When I think of you, I see my own life flash before my eyes. And then I see you dead. - What the hell happened here? - Why did you it, Megan? - Do what? - This. She died screaming, you fuck! All right, that's enough. That's enough. Hey, whoa. Detective, can I see your warrant? Huh? What the hell's going on here? Breaking and entering, searching without a warrant, harassment! Oh, Detective, you're history! Detective Turner is an eye witness to a homicide. All right, Turner, then you tell me, what allegedly did you see? I saw this man, shoot and kill my best friend, in front of my eyes. I've really had enough of this, Mr. Dawson. I was walking down the hall with her, she was leaving. He came up behind me, put a gun in my back. But she kept walking, she didn't see him. - And I tried to warn her. - If whoever it was, came up behind you, how could you know it was me? Detective, did you see the suspect's face? I told you he came up behind me. Then how can you make a positive identification? Jesus Christ, I think she knows him by now. She said she did not actually see his face! Well? No. Detective. I'm going to have your job by the end of the day. And furthermore, I think you need help. Mr. Dawson, I'm personally going to see to it, that your client is removed from the face of the earth. Dawson's going to make some real trouble in the Department. Hoyt's not going to be able to run interference for us much longer, you should know that. Do you believe me, Nick? We got nothing to go on, Megan. Nothing substantial anyway. It's all based on hunch, conjecture, instinct. Do you believe me, Nick? Yeah, I believe you. Listen, why don't you take tomorrow off? You need some rest. If you need to go anywhere, just let me know, I'll make sure... make sure the department issues you a car. Now, I'm not going to put you under surveillance or anything. So don't fuck around. I mean you're a cop, you're supposed to be able to handle yourself, remember that. She had two little babies. I know. I'm sorry, Megan. Mom. Mom. I'm so sorry about Tracy. - Mom. - Nothing. - What happened to your arm? - Nothing! - Mom. - Don't you say anything, Shirley. Did you do this to her? She had an accident, she fell down the stairs! Mom, did he do this to you? Just tell me! Just tell me. - You don't talk, Shirley. - Shut up, Dad! Just shut up. I've had just about enough of you. You hit her again, you son of a bitch. You don't have nothing to say about us! You're under arrest. Are you kidding me? My daughter putting me under arrest? All right, come on, that's enough. Come on, that's enough! You let me out of this car this goddamn minute! You hear me? Take these things off of my wrist! - Now you listen to me, I'm your father! - And I'm ashamed of that. Just give me one good reason why I shouldn't take you in. - I don't believe this, I don't fucking... - Dad! Why? I do not know. I get mad. If it happens again... Come on. - We're back. - Frank? Hi, Shirley, hi. Megan, honey, your friend is here. Frank, this is Eugene, Eugene Hunt. - And this is my husband Frank Turner. - Hi. - Mom. - What is it, hon? Nothing. Did I make a mistake? I thought we were supposed to meet someplace else. No. Mom, Dad, could I just speak to you guys in the kitchen for a second please? Megan have a guest now. Maybe I could just have a word alone with Eugene then. - Just us. - Oh come on Megan, we're not adolescents. There isn't anything we can't say in front of your folks. - Can I take your coat? - No. I have a cold, I'd just as soon keep it on. I have the same thing, I just can't seem to get rid of it. ...authorities investigating the 44-Magnum-killer terrorizing the city, believe they have found yet another body. Listen to this. Sit down. Dad, I don't want to watch TV. Do you mind if I turn it off? No, shut it off. I just wanted to come over here and talk to you, get to know you a little bit. Boy, Mr. and Mrs. Turner, you sure are a couple of lucky parents to have a daughter like Megan. Let me tell you, being with Megan, it's the biggest kick of all. I do have a couple errands I could run before we go out, so maybe we should just leave now. I'm just getting to know your folks. Okay. I can stay. Eugene, stay a while. You look like you're about to go. Yeah. What? Sit down. You look like you're about to go. That's right. I have to go. I'm sorry. I hope you don't think it's impolite of me. Well, I'm sorry that you have to leave so soon. I'm sure we'll see one another again. Yeah, I hope so. I'm glad you stopped by. - It's a pleasure, Sir. - It's nice to meet some of Megan's friends. This was quite a surprise. Nick, what about a warrant? Hoyt's trying as we speak. He's got to get a signature from the judge though. Dawson's going to tear him a new asshole. Shit. Where are you, Megan? Oh, don't tell me. Let me guess. You're staking out Eugene's apartment building. I'm just sitting here letting my car cool off. Okay. Remember, we got didley on this guy so... just watch, okay? What's wrong Nick? Don't you trust one of your partners? I trust you totally, Megan. Slow down, jerk! Shit! Fuck. Looking for something?

You can tell by the sediment at the bottom of the cup. Why were you following me? You didn't think I could handle it? - I wanted to watch you handle it. - Bullshit. - No shit. - Bullshit.
