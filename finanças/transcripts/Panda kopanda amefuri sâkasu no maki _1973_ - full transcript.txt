"Dad, Panny and I are all doing very well!" "That's because we met some terrific people!" "Who do you think it was, Grandma?" It's inside this house! Seems like nobody's home. No matter! Let's hurry and take it back! Mr. Tiger! Here, kitty kitty! IS ANYBODY HOME?!! You'll make the tiger run away! Mr. Tiger! Here, kitty kitty! Think it's okay, letting ourselves in? I don't like the feel of this. Mr. Tiger! Mr. Tiger! Are you in there? Nobody's here. I'm sure he's here! Let's look! Ouch! Boss! Find him? Take a look at this! What're you doing?! Get looking for him! It's just that I've never seen one this small. And there's a mid-sized one. Huh? And this big one! Boss... What now? What kind of person would use this monstrous tooth brush? Start looking, or I'll really get mad! Now where could that tiger have gotten to? Th-That seat...! That seat! What kind of person would have that monstrous seat?! And that monstrous spoon! That monstrous plate! And what kind of thing would eat salad like this?! Boss, there's no doubt about it! There's some kind of great big thing living here! Something like a man-eating bear! Maybe it even ate the tiger! Huh?! A... A footprint! Even a man-eating bear's footprints aren't this big! What is it?! I don't see anything. It was... it was... this big! Strange, I could've sworn I saw it. What? T-tiny and r-round! I don't see anybody. Huh? Over there!! Welcome! You guys are burglars, right? This is great! It's the first time I've ever seen a burglar! Wow! Wow! Burglars! Burglars! How do you do? I'm Papa Panda! Too bad. Just when I finally got to see real burglars...! They must be very busy. Mommy! Dinner! Dinner! Yes, I guess it's that time. Let's eat! Let's eat! Let's eat! Somebody ate it! Somebody ate my curry! Yeah, you're right. I wonder if those burglars ate it? I'll get you some more. I'm sure those burglars must've been very hungry. Just like me. Someone used my towel and got it all dirty. Someone broke my trumpet! Somebody's sleeping in my bed. Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Hey! It's a tiger! A baby tiger! Oh... This is my daddy. This is my mommy. Mine too! Mine too! Great! After the burglars, a tiger came to our house! I'm Tiny! I'm Panny! Wow! Wow! Tiny! Tiny! Wow! Wow! Panny! Panny! This is good. What a nice visitor! Come on, let's all have dinner together! More, please! Wow! Ready... settee... here we... come! We can't get out! They're sleeping side-by-side. Oh. Hey, Dad? I wonder where that tiger came from? Wonder if he has a mom? I'll ask around in town, tomorrow. Daddy! Hi! Dad! I'm going to run some errands. I wanna go, too! Hang on a minute. I'm just going to stick this in the mailbox. Stay off the tracks! I will. Me too! Mommy! Huh? Wonder where they went? Panny! Tiny! Strange. I wonder if they went on ahead? Mimi! Did you know the circus was in town? The circus? Yeah! It came in last night, on the train! Yeah, and there are lions and all kinds of animals! Hey, you wanna go? Is there a tiger in that circus? I dunno. Probably! Come on, let's go! Then maybe Tiny belongs to the circus... Which means... Well? Are you going, or what? Sure, I'll go! Oh, what a fix! Where on earth could that tiger have gotten to? We've turned the place upside-down. And I had my fill of that house last night. Gee, a circus! Huh? A panda! After it! It's that panda! Stop!! Oh, no! The panda's gonna get eaten by the tiger! No way. You children are naughty! Come on, just a quick look! Come on, just a little! No, I said. We're setting up. Come back tomorrow and see. And bring ticket money! Not fair! Mister! Have you seen my panda, Panny?! Panda? Yeah! The panda and tiger are lost! Tiny! Help! A panda's gone into the tiger's cage! A panda has..?! Hey, stop! Get back here! Come on... That's a good girl, let go of that panda. Come on... Pandas don't taste any good! Please, let him out. Please! No, stop! Stop! She's in danger! Mommy! Mommy! This is my mommy! This is my mommy! Hello, you must be Tiny's mom. I'm Mimiko, Panny's mom. Great! I'm so excited! Hooray! The tiger came back! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! How nice! The burglars, and Tiny, and the circus folk were all nice. Look! The boss gave us some tickets, to thank us. Let's all go tomorrow. Wow! Wow! A circus! A circus! Tiny's gonna be in the show with his mom. It's going to be very nice weather tomorrow. Oh... Huh? Hey, is it raining? Hurry, Dad! Right. I don't like the rain. I don't like the rain. I wonder if Tiny and the others are getting wet. They'll be okay. Rain is important; it makes living things stronger. And it's especially good for bamboo. I don't like when it rains. The circus will be cancelled. Don't worry, I'm sure it'll be nice out tomorrow. Hey, let's have a snack. A snack? Here! It's Tiny! It's Tiny! It's Tiny! "Dear Grandma." "The storm still hasn't passed." "The rain just pours down." "Panny is very disappointed." "I'm sure there's going to be a big flood." "I wonder how Tiny and the others are." "I'm very worried about them." Mommy, I'm scared. I'm right here. Don't be afraid, go to sleep. Is Tiny okay? Sure! Tiny's mom is very strong, after all. I'm gonna give Tiny my cookie! Wow, I'm sure he'll be surprised! Now close your eyes. Gee whiz! Dad! Hurry and wake up! Oh! Dad, look! Some fish! Isn't this nice! A nice flood. And the bamboo is especially nice! Dad! Time for lunch! Coming! Here, help yourself. Thank you. Daddy! Daddy! Yes? Since you're down there, get some jam from the kitchen. Sure. Tiny! Tiny! The circus ball. So the circus must be flooded, too. What could this be? Tiny! Tiny! Read it! Read it! These are Tiny's footprints, but... It says, "Help, help!" Signed, Tiny. So they're having trouble with all the water! Dad! Let's save them! Take this, Dad! Here. Got it. And we're off! Isn't it nice, Dad?! Look, the town looks like an island! Oh, it's Mimi! Boss, where are Tiny and the others? The animals were washed away by the water. Oh, that's terrible! So you guys took of f without them?! Well, uh... We tried to get them onto the train. But the water came suddenly... ...and only the people escaped. Gee! Hey, Mimi! Hurry, Dad! Poor Tiny and the others! Ah! Over there! Tiny! Tiny! You're safe, now! We re going to get you out! We have food! Just wait a bit longer! Here! My cookie! My cookie! It's going to get a little noisy. Come on out. There you are. This is fun! Nice, Dad! My turn, next! There. Here's some cabbage.

Sorry about the racket. You're the greatest, Dad! "And so, Grandma..." "...the people in town and from the circus were very happy." "And we're even happier than before, so don't worry."
