You'll find out soon enough, dear, when the governor unmasks her. And when he says to me, how's Trix, I says... well, I don't know, but I here she's in Nachez. Wait a minute, girls, you know way better than that. Balcony entrance. Alright, Joe, but just you wait till you ask me to put it on the cup again. Just you wait. Yeah, and you ought to either give up brass buttons or gambling! Take yo ease, take yo ease! Who do you think you is bustling down the street like you owns it? We's quality folks, that's who we is, poor trash! Don't you call me poor trash! I's got enough money at home to buy you, fill your big teeth with gold, then give you away. O go home, get away, woman. Go home. I got as much right to see who's gonna be beauty queen here tonight... ...as you quality folks. Mr. Lincoln emancipated and proclamated me. - Come on, Napoleon, where is she? - Your father said... Come on, what did they do to you, scoundrel, now, where is it? Please, Mr. Allen, I think you've had enough of her society tonight. Is there no gallantry in you, Napoleon? Don't you realize a queen is being crowned tonight... ...and one must always toast a queen? Ain't no sense in toasting her to a crisp. I still think you'd better leave it with me, sir. It'll be much happier with me. We were made for each other and I promise... ...never to stop caring until the day I die. Three fangs from an alligator and it'll all bring you luck and the promised land. Good evening, Mr. Alan, don't you want to buy a little charm for luck, sir? Not for me, Joe. It'll take more than a voodoo charm... ...to change the luck of the Aldersons. # I'm singing 'bout the conjure man # # I'm singing 'bout the charms I sell # Move over! Shut up or I'll spit on you till you's as green as a lizard. Take it easy, there, mama, take it easy! Why don't you move over and go ahead? Why don't you sit down? Get over! Don't you see a lady is trying to get down here? Oh, why don't you be yourself? You oughtn't to be bursting out! Shut up! Ladies and gentlemen of Memphis. At this season of the year... ...when our great city gives itself over to the gameless bird of carnival, it is our custom and privilege to select a queen. A girl who must typify the very flower of the south. From what I hear, Jack Morgan should be appointing himself king. Yes. Political king of Memphis. I wouldn't trust that Jack Morgan in my garden. My husband says he's done a lot for Memphis. And a lot for your husband. And it is no idle boast to say that this great city of ours... ...has for long years cradled the most beautiful, the most charming and the most aristocratic ladies of all Dixie. And so, ladies and gentlemen, it now gives me great personal pleasure... to present the man who will unmask your queen. His excellency the governor. As representative of the people of the great state of Tennessee, I take pleasure in introducing your Queen of the Mardi Gras. I know who it is. Juanita Desez. She's the only one that can walk down stairs like that... without falling flat on her... Mary Lou! Why, it's Jenny Blake of the Memphis Belle. A Jezebel who runs a gambling house. - Our boss! - It's Jenny! It's my baby! The Queen of the Carnival! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! I trust you're enjoying your little joke. Joke? Wait a minute. Wait a minute all of you! Ladies and gentlemen! If you think this is a joke, you're all fired wrong. Why shouldn't I be queen? I'm the one they voted for. If there's some of you who are a little disappointed... ...that you weren't chosen, that's not my fault. Not my fault either that I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth. Maybe some of you should get out your history books. I can name you a lot of queens that came from the wrong side of town. And a lot of lulus that came from the right side. I want to thank you ladies for coming. As for the gentlemen, you know you're always welcome at my place, the Memphis Bell, where you can be yourselves! And in the meantime, whoever wants to take over this being queen, it's theirs for the asking. And to show you there are no hard feelings... I'll toss in a cast-iron bustle with the compliments of the house. This is a downright scandal. Chin up, General. Your mustache is at half mast. Bringing us down here, making fools of us in front of our wives. Easy now, Your Honor. No harm meant, no harm done. I told you Memphis society wouldn't put up... ...with making a queen out of your Memphis belle. Make a queen? Out of Jen? Why, boys, she is a queen. And any time she wants to hold court... ...you'll be there. Put that thing away or I'll pin it down to your bussel. That ain't no bussel, honey, that's me. - Get me my hat. - Miss Jenny, - ...seeing as how you's have abdicated... - Take it, burn it. I don't give a picayune what you do with it. I look better in this anyway. Mr. Morgan says he doesn't like you in that gettup. He says it's too inebriated. What does that no-good son-of-a-horse-thief know about... You have to stop running down my father. He was awfully sensitive. Get out of here. And the next time you enter a lady's boudoir knock. Jack Morgan, if you show me any sympathy, I'll... I'll beat your brains out. Sympathy? You asked for what you got. Here. There's something in your eye. There's nothing in my eye but murder. Never you mind, baby. You was a queen what is a queen. And a hundred years from today this town will still be talking about you. And a hundred years from today the Jenny Blakes... ...will still be getting the axe from the bluebloods. Bluebloods? I could tell them a thing or two about their husbands. - Yes, but you won't. - Why not? - Yeah, why not? - Shut up! Why not? - Because you are a lady. - Now you's talking, Mr. Jack. - Get out of here. - Yes, get out. - Or I'll ship you back to Africa. - Yessir, I's going. After what happened tonight have you still got that society bug in your curls? More than ever. You're stupid, you know that, don't you, baby? There wasn't a woman at that opera house tonight that wasn't envious of you. If you don't believe me, think how dull their lives are. Save that fat shovel for the numbskulls that come to the Memphis Bell. Maybe I can get it through that blond dome of yours this way. Take this layout. Personally, I like it. But they think it's a museum where you pay to see freaks. Look at that hair. To me it's gold. But to them bleach is only used on sheets. Oh, forget them, Jen. Think what they did to you tonight. I knew they would. - You knew they would? - Sure. The men had to come, but they told me their wives would walk out on you. And you let me go out there and make a fool of myself? - Yeah. - Why you double-crossing son of... - Ah-ah... remember Father's feelings. - Why did you do it, why did you do it?! Because I love you. You got a swell way of showing it. Love you enough to show you once and for all that the two don't mix. Our kind and theirs. Look, sugar, you don't know how lucky you are. A handsome duck like me, fancy duds from Paris. And sparklers enough to light up all Tennessee. Oh, Jack, you don't understand. You won't understand. - It's what I dreamed of all my life. - Crazy dreams. Just because I was born into Mississippi Hollow, because Mother wore her eyes out doing plain sewing, because my father died of swamp fever trying to make a few potatoes grow. - Is that why I'm being punished? - Who's punishing you, baby? When I was a kid I used to go up there to that big house on the hill, peek through a picket fence. And what did you think you saw? Everything I wanted. And still want. To be respectable, to live up there with those fine people. To be a civilized human being. I don't want to be a gambling-house gal all my life. I want to be quality folk. Bankrupt gentry with patches in their pants. I want those patches. Oh, Miss Jenny! Almost ready for your number now. You'll find those patches tougher to get than the diamond jewelry. Tough, huh? I'll bet you that those same people that walked out on me tonight... ...will dance for me for their supper. Most of them could use a square meal. A fine bodyguard you are. Where have you been all day? Boss, what happened to me shouldn't happen to a dog. What happened? You told me to collect that money from Crane. - Yeah. - Well... I went to his house and he wanted to throw me down the steps. - How do you know? - How do I know. Because he threw me down. I thought you said he only wanted to throw you down. Well, if he didn't want to, would he throw me down? Why don't you send him back to Russia? Hey, Jenny, how does it feel to be crowned? Now I know. He's winning. Why don't you ask him to dance? I did. When you heel up, try again. - Hello, Jenny. - How are you doing? - Good evening, Jen. - Hello, Tom. Black. Thanks, mister. Looks like you're the only one who took up my invitation. Well, my bottle ran out, ma'am, and the instincts of a homing pigeon led me directly to your place. 14 red wins. It's my body you're supposed to guard. Sorry, boss, but that's my trouble. I can't say no. Boris, better go help at the bar. And no nipping between serves. Yes, ma'am. Young Alderson's losing pretty heavily, isn't he? - Hm-hmm. With both hands. - What a crust. With his family silver on its way to the pawn shop. What are you talking about? The Alderson plantation. It's going to be sold next week for taxes. - The Shadows? - Yeah. Say, I ought to buy it and give it to you for a playhouse. Alan Alderson wants you to take his IOU. Alan Alderson? You can tell him his credit's about as good around here as Confederate money. Just a minute. I'll take it. - Have you gone crazy? - Maybe. Well, you've got about as much chance of getting that money back... - ... as I have of leading a choir. - That's my business. Less chance. - There you are, Mr. Alderson. - Oh, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the management, I bid you all welcome to the Memphis Belle. This season we are presenting for your edification... the most spectacular production of your favorite number... "High Up In A Balloon, Boys". Featuring your very talented and charming young hostess, Miss Jenny Blake. I am, as you know, a Tennessee belle. who did captivate once a magnificent swell. He was envoy, ambassador, or something rare... to King whatsisname of... I do not really care. It was at Saratoga, a year come next June. And we waltzed, and we talked, by the light of the moon. There were squeezing of hands... ...followed up by a kiss. And as far as I remember... I felt just like this. # Up in a balloon, boys # # Up in a balloon # # All among the little stars, # # Sailing 'round the moon # # Up in a balloon, boys # # Up in a balloon # # There's something very jolly being # # Up in a balloon # # Up in a balloon, boys # # Up in a balloon # # All among the little stars # # And sailing 'round the moon # 18 red wins. # It's something very jolly to be # # Up in a balloon # # He bought her diamonds # # And a lovely string of pearls # # String of pearls # # And a tiara full of rubies # # For her curls # # For her curls # # # # By some misadventure # # He had gone adrift # The marriage kiss came. I practiced a tear. I got up a blush. And my veil was a dear. The parson was ready, likewise the champagne. But, ah, my false lover, I never saw him again. The wretch! The scoundrel! Scoundrel! Blunderer! Ingrate! I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, the fool! Where did he go? Where did he go? Come on, everybody, you know where he went. # Up in a balloon, boys # # Up in a balloon # # All among the little stars, # # Sailing 'round the moon # # Up in a balloon, boys # # Up in a balloon # # It's something very jolly to be # # Up in a balloon # # Up in a balloon, boys # # Up in a balloon # # All among the little stars # # Sailing 'round the moon # # Up in a balloon, boys # # Up in a balloon # # It's something very jolly to be # # Up, up, up, up, up, up # The queen was in the count house counting out her money. Come in. At your service and in your debt. Up to your ears. Unsociable fellow your croupier. He divested me of my credit at 5.000 and said you wanted to see me. I thought you might want to redeem these. Well, unfortunately I can't. Can't? Of course, with your back turned, I could tear them up. Ah, but being a gentleman, I wouldn't. No, you only leave me one way out. Have you a gun? That wouldn't wind up this affair. You'd still owe me the money. Dead or alive. You know... For thousands of years gentlemen have been killing themselves... ...over gambling debts and not one of them ever thought of that. You're pretty desperate, aren't you? Maybe I could help. Don't offer me a rabbit's foot. I've tried that. I have a proposition to make to you. I have what you need, money. And you have what I want. Background, position... ...and a name that everyone respects. Not recently. I want that name. Are you proposing to me, my dear? Call it that if you want to. I'm honored, ma'am. But here, I think you need this more than I do. I know it's unladylike to take advantage of the situation but... ...you're in a fix and I am taking advantage of it. Sure. But I refuse to be swept off my feet. I understand The Shadows is being sold for taxes next week. Yes. I had hoped that by a turn of the wheel I might save it. It's a pity to lose it. Nobody but an Alderson has ever lived there. Nobody but an Alderson ever should. Well, how about it? Shall we drink to a bad bargain? Boss, she's just come in. She's up in her room. - Excuse me, gentlemen. - Alright. Hello, babe, where have you b... What's going on? - Don't touch that fire! - Have you gone crazy? Let it burn. I need a fire in a cold night like this. - I'm not that cold. - I said let it burn! Now wait a minute, babe. Half this boat belongs to me. All right, go ahead, put out your half. You have gone crazy. I believe in burning my boats behind me. Then there'll be nothing left to remind Memphis that Jenny Blake ever lived. You're going somewhere, baby? Yes. And take your hat off in front of a lady. I just married Alan Alderson. So grand-looking, and stately, and old. Hmm, wait till it rains and that grand and stately dankness creeps into your bones. You know, this is the first time I've ever looked forward to coming home. - Good morning, Napoleon. - Good morning, sir. Jenny, the Aldersons. How do you do? The Aldersons, Jenny. My wife. Oh, Alan! I forgot to carry you across the threshold. Have you gone daft, you? Oh, come now, Father, no Alderson ever brought a bride home without carrying her across the threshold. Surely you must have carried my mother across. You will please not mention your mother at this time. Welcome to The Shadows, my dear. Catherine! - Yes, Julia. - Just a minute. I know how you all feel and I... I reckon I don't blame you. Very generous of you. If you were clever enough, young woman, to take advantage of my son's deplorable condition... and maneuver him into a marriage, you'll be clever enough. Please, I know this is an awful shock to you... - Of course you know who I am... - We do indeed! But what you don't know is how hard I'm going to try to be a wife here. That Alan respects, that you all respect. Julia, call the carriage. We'll find a way to arrange an annulment. Just a minute, Father. I must have neglected to tell you about Jenny. You may not be able to find my wife's family crest in the social Gazette... but she has something that I think you'll appreciate even more. Her financial position is unassailable. You know, money. Money, the stuff they make in Washington, not Richmond. We have a whole cellar full of Confederate money... but Father's like me when it comes to gambling. He always picks the wrong color. He put his money down in the gray and up came the blue. Alan, you must realize her presence in this house is utterly impossible. As you wish, Father, but as Jenny goes, so goes The Shadows. Sounds like the title of a song, doesn't it? As Jenny goes, so goes The Shadows... As Jenny goes, so goes The Shadows... Well, how about it? Aunt Julia, dear, aren't you going to call for the carriage? Wait, Julia. I thought so. Practical people the Aldersons. Why all the gloom? This is cause for a celebration. Please... Miss Julia, Mr. Alderson, you won't be sorry, I promise you. Welcome home, Mrs. Alderson. Open up there, country boy. - Who is you? - I's the lady that wants to get in. - I don't see no lady. - Then stop swillin' that corn liquor. If you looks right in front of you, here I is big as life. Personal maid to Mrs. Alderson. There ain't no Mrs. Alderson here. Big boy, does you want this door on its hinges? Coz I's built for going right through it. We ain't openin' no door to no waterfront woman. Then just stay right where you is... coz I's comin' through and croppin' you to death. Miss Jenny, Miss Jenny! Here I is, Miss Jenny. Where's you? It's me, it's Chloe. Well it's about time you got here. Here I come, Miss Jenny, laughin' and scratchin'. - The name is Mrs. Alderson. - 'Scuse me, Mrs. Alderson. Where will I put this junk, Mrs. Alderson? Put it down anywhere. What was that noise I heard? It woke me up. I had a scuffle at the door. That slave that calls himself Napoleon didn't hanker to let me in. - Is he alright? - Yessum. But they's gonna have to put in a new door. Looks like we both got a warm reception. Don't mention nothin' hot. When I think about my brand-new queen's dress... ...all burned and scorched-like. What are you shaking about? It was only a dress. Yessum, but I was in it. - Where's the groom? - He's combing lice out of his hair. I bet his folks sure was tickled when he brought home a beautiful bride like you. Hysterical. And now if you'll unpack and get me a dress, I'll go down and join my family. Well hello there. What kind of contraption's that? Well, ma'am, it don't kill no flies... but it sure gets 'em dizzy dodging it. Doesn't anyone work around here? No, ma'am. Ground's too poor for cotton no more and... ...Mr. Stephen won't plant nothin' else. so we just sets. No wonder the place has gone to pot. You can't make money when you just "set". No, but you can sure catch up on a heap of rest. - Oh, Miss Jenny. - Hello. I picked these flowers for your room. - Oh, how sweet of you. - And some mint to make you a toddy. David always said they were so refreshing. - Thank you, Miss Catherine. - Aunt Catherine. I'm so glad Alan brought you home. I'm glad to know I rang the bell with one member of the family. Oh, I liked you right away. Your brother and sister are so... so different. Well, Julia and Stephen have a lot of family pride. I do hope you try to understand and not let it upset you. I won't. And Alan is such a fine boy really. - Where is he? - I... I don't know. I haven't seen him. David would never have left me on our wedding day. - But modern men I guess are different. - David? - He was my fianc?. - Oh. He was so handsome. And we were so much in love. Like lovers are in books. But you never married. Oh, no, no... Everything was ready... My wedding dress was all white lace. But... But what? Here we are back again. I'll put the flowers in your room. He plays just beautiful. - Catherine. - Yes, Julia? - Your sleeve is torn. - Is it? That lovely lace that your grandmother wore. I'm so sorry. How careless you are. Where have you been? - I was just picking some mint. - How stupidly careless. With the few nice things you have. I'll go change. She's such a darling, Aunt Catherine. She was telling me about her fianc? David. What's she been telling you? he was starting to tell me what happened to him. What was it? He jilted her on the wedding day. We really were glad, weren't we, Stephen? Yes, he was just riffraff. - Catherine was well rid of him. - But she loved him. - Poor aunt Catherine. - Foolish Catherine, you mean. Come, Julia, it's time to dress for supper. If Alan's wife will excuse us. Yes. And I'm sure she'll want to change that costume she's wearing. What's wrong with this dress? It cost a pile of money. I sent all the way down to New Orleans for it. But of course the price wouldn't make it in good taste. It suits you perfectly. I didn't know you were home. Aren't you going to ask where I've been all day? - Why should I? - You're my wife, aren't you? It's a wise wife who doesn't ask. What's that you're playing? Oh, just a couple of thoughts I tried to put together once upon a time. Nice. Haven't you had enough of it yet? - No, I like it. The Shadows I mean. It isn't going to work out, Jenny. We Aldersons are a queer lot. We don't like one another. We like outsiders even less. So I gather. We are the shadows, don't you understand? No matter how hard you try, no matter what you do... ...you'll never become part of us. I'll take my chances. Why should you want to become part of all this darkness and bitterness? I made a bargain. You were cheated. We'll take everything you have to give and you get nothing in return. - Nothing at all. - That's my gamble. I should have told you all this last night. Last night I was too drunk to care what happened to either one of us. And now when you're sober? Give it up, Jenny. Leave The Shadows before you do become an Alderson. Thanks for the warning. Your carriage, Mr. Alan. Are you going out? I didn't mean to ask. Oh, that's quite alright, Mrs. Alderson. I'm dining out. I always dine out. Dining with my family is something more than gastronomic endurance can withstand. Come in. Hello, aunt Catherine. - I brought you a mint toddy, Jenny. - Thank you. Take it, dear. It'll perk you up. You look sort of tuckered out. Oh, I'm alright. It's so nice having someone in the house to do things for. Someone young and gay. Someone who laughs. I don't feel much like laughing right now. Oh, I'm so sorry, dear. I want you to be happy here. - Then you won't ever leave. - Leave? Please, don't ever leave here, ever. No, dear, I won't. Julia. Why are you here at this hour? I just brought Jenny a toddy. It's late. You'd better be getting in bed. Very well, Julia. Will you please not encourage Catherine? She's not very well. The least little thing upsets her. Then there's always trouble. Wha... what's that? Oh, nothing. Does you see anything behind my back? Yes, a tree. Ssssince when can a tree walk? It's just a tree outside the window. Oh. What's that? What's what? That flapping sound. Oh, Chloe, you're hearing things. Go fill my tub. Yessum. Did you say something then? I hope. No. - Did you breathe hard? - No. Then that's a ghost, that's what it is. Oh, Chloe, you don't believe in ghosts, do you? No, ma'am. But I's afraid of them. Shoo! Get away from me, ghost! Shoo! Shoo! Kangamuilili. Kangare futi. Kanga. Bumba kangadi futi. Bumba kangadi futi. Kangadi futi. Kanga. Bumba kanga dicala. Stop that voodoo babbling. It's just a raven. Raven? That's worse than ghosts. Ravens is a sure sign of death. Your superstitions will be the death of me. That's what I's sayin' honey. Let's skiddaddle out of this mess before the coroner with the dead wagon get us. You jumped right out of the fire in the frying pan. Voodoo tells me that we belongs to the levee. And let's get back there while there's still tide enough to take us. You go if you want to. I'm staying here. Dark, dank ol' house falling apart. Yes... yes, that's what's wrong. No wonder people have the hoops and jingles here. Chloe, we'll renovate the place. We'll make it bright and cheery. And while we're at it we'll do a little renovating on ourselves. So they'll be proud to ask folks here to meet me. What's wrong with ourselves? That costume, for instance. What's wrong with that? I saw a hundred men rise up and whistle... ...the first time you wore it at the Memphis Belle. That's what's wrong with it. Men aren't supposed to whistle at ladies. Honey, when men stop whistling at me I hopes I'm dead. Yes, indeed, Mrs. Ponsinby, The Shadows does look powerful nice since we freshened it up a bit. It was so charming of you and Mrs. Raleigh to drop by. It's too bad my husband's not here... ...but Miss Julia and Mr. Alderson and I will give our best to entertain you. Mrs. Raleigh, may I help you? Would you like another cup of tea? Tea. What I need is a shot of rye. Is the company going yet? There is no company and you know it. Yessum, but I's wondering if you knowed it. Honey child, I wonder if you sees what I sees. 'Pears like you's gonna have cotton after all. He wouldn't dare come here. That sure was a quick visit he paid someone. Chloe, come away from that door. You knows how it is, honey child. You can't stop a man from jes lookin'. Hiya, angel. Oh, hello. I was just passing down the lane and thought I'd drop in... ...and see how the great lady was getting on. Splendidly, thank you. - How are they treating you, Jenny? - Why, they're... they're charming. All of them. There isn't enough they can do for me. Taking me places, inviting their friends here. Yes, I see your name in the society column every morning. Thought you might be interested in hearing about an elegant little shack... ...I just opened, the King's Club. Where quality can spend its idle hours and loose change. Very interesting. We're throwing quite a shindig down there tonight to baptize it. And I thought that between dining with his honor the mayor and stopping by... ...Mrs. Reginald Fussbudget's soir?e you might like to drop in. For old times' sake. Yes, why don't you run down there, Jenny? I'm sure all your friends would miss you if you weren't there. And a lady never neglects her old friends even if she has to meet them clandestinely. My error, ma'am. Nice to have seen you, Jenny. Come in. Here's your toddy, dear. Thank you, aunt Catherine. It is refreshing. I'm getting so I look forward to it every night. So do I. And to our little talks together too. I do wish I could stay here with you instead of going to that old concert. - You'll enjoy it. - Don't you like music? Yes, I love it. Then why don't you change your mind and come with us? - Well, I... I wasn't asked. - You weren't? - Oh, dear, Julia said you... - Catherine. Come along. It's getting late. What you doing down here, honey, in this old, dark, gloomy room? Doing? Nothing! Talking to myself. Couple more moments like this and I'll start answering myself back. I's already is, and I's getting a parcel of mighty funny answers. They can't even try to be civil. It make me bile inside to see you set home alone day after day and night after night... - Get out of here, Chloe! - Yessum. But you should be makin' them sizzle down at the King Club openin'... ...instead o' settin' here hiberdatin'. Yes... Yes, it would be nice to go somewhere where... ...where somebody'd be glad to see us. - I said get out of here! - Yessum. But I knows somebody who'd be proper glad to see you. Honey, you is looking fine as fit silk and his eyeballs were wide o... - Get out of here quick! - Yessum. And order my carriage. Mrs. Alderson is going to town. Mine pal, that will teach you not to insult a lady! And you not to be pals with a pal who insults a lady, mine pal! Boris! Ai-ai-ai-ai-ai! Jennyshka! If I was only twenty years younger. Ai-ai-ai-ai-ai! - Where's Morgan? - Well, follow me... I mean, I'll follow you, Mrs. Alderson. I'm so glad to see you! - Well, if it ain't Miss Jenny. - Hello, Big Mike. - Glad to see you. - Thank you. # I used to have a man # # From that Beale Street town # Well, how do you like it? Oh, it's wonderful. The only thing missing is you, Jennyshka. # Has anybody seen my man # So I said, I hear she's... - Jenny! - Mabel. Oh, Jenny, what a treat for sore eyes! Mabel, you look grand. Flo... Flo! - Jenny! - Oh, what's the matter? Are you drowning your sorrows or just trying to irrigate them? That mujik insulted her. He had his arms around her neck... I was holding them there. He was asking me to marry him and I was scared he'd get away. I oughta make you marry me. What do you want with a man who couldn't lick Boris? The same thing that I'd want with a man who could lick him. Boris said ai-ai-ai-ai-ai. I'm not Russian. But I feel the same way. Sit down, sweetheart. It's beautiful here. Makes the Memphis Belle look like an old tug. It had something, though, that old tug. I miss it sometimes. Do you? I miss you, Jen. Not too much, I notice. Oh, you mean that? Well, my doctor thought that I ought to eat more and... ...and at the same time get exercise. So when I finish a course at this side of the table... I run around to that side... - Oh... - How did you like my number, dear? Great. Fine. Now you run along and give them an encore. Not a bad number herself. Well, what did you expect? Find me in sack cloth pouring ashes over my head? Expect me to go into mourning? Jack, you don't have to explain. I understand. Gotta have someone around to show off your new Paris duds. - Give me a cigarette. - Oh, no! I haven't any fire insurance yet. Your husband was just here. It's nice to see your money in circulation. Even if you're not. Mrs. Alan Alderson. Mrs. Alan Alderson. Why don't you quit fooling yourself? Look at your eyes going from table to table. Right now you're wondering what Flo's doing. Whether somebody's gonna slip a load of dice over on the house. Give you a couple of hours back here and you'll come to life again. You're not Mrs. Alan Alderson, you're Jenny Blake flying under false colors. Get out of that rig, Jen, and back into your beats. I'm never coming back. I've got what I've always wanted. - Respectability, a name? - And all that goes with it. Roots that go back for centuries. Is that all you're getting for your money, roots? I'm going home. Oh, Jen, I have a little present for you. It's in the office. - I don't accept presents anymore. - You're gonna accept this one. Even the Aldersons would approve. Where are you going, honey? I'm hungry. Good. Now you just sit right down, have your steak and get a little strength. 'Cause if I'm not back in five minutes, you can take another encore. You can be nice and thoughtful at times. I bought it for you this afternoon after our little chat at your house. I was going to send it to you. - Why you! - Ah-ah! Father hasn't turned over in his grave since you last insulted him. Well here's where your pop becomes a whirling dervish, you insulting son of a horse thief! His Excellency the Governor... His Honor the Mayor... Hm, Jenny's gonna have quite a quilting bee. Julia, how could you countenance such a thing? I knew nothing about it. Why shouldn't Jenny give a ball if she wants to? I won't insult those people by inviting them here. You're not inviting them here, she is. I tell you straight out your aunt Julia and I won't be here. Oh, I think you will, Father. Neither one of you would dare jeopardize your bread and butter. - I'll forbid it! - As you say, Father. But in good society who pays the piper usually calls the dance. - Did you want me, sir? - Yes, Napoleon. Deliver those invitatons. Yessir. - Napoleon, put those things in the fire. - Go and do as you were told. Have you taken leave of your senses? Don't be a fool, Stephen. No one will come. Not a blessed soul. I'll see to that. Yes? - Busy, Jack? - Oh, come in, General. I wondered, Jack, if you'd mind extending my credit for a few thousand more. Always glad to help you boys out. I've had confounded bad luck the whole blasted afternoon. But I'll get it back tonight. Some other night, you mean. Tonight, I said. Why, aren't you going to the big Alderson ball? Big nothing. Nobody's going. Why not? Just not, that's all. # Ezekiel saw the wheel # # Way in the middle of the air # # Ezekiel saw the wheel # # Way up in the middle of the air # # And the little wheel run by faith # # And the big wheel run by the grace of God # # A wheel in a wheel # # Way in the middle of the air # # Ezekiel saw the wheel # # Way in the middle of the air # # Ezekiel saw the wheel # # Way up in the middle of the air # # And the little wheel run by faith # # And the big wheel run by the grace of God # # A wheel in a wheel # # Way in the middle of the air # # You better mind, my brother # # How you walk on the cross # # Way in the middle of the air # # Your foot might slip and your soul get lost # # Way up in the middle of the air # # Ezekiel saw the wheel # # Way up in the middle of the air # # Ezekiel saw the wheel # Chloe! # And the little wheel run by faith # # And the big wheel run by the grace of God # # A wheel in a wheel # # Way in the middle of the air # # Come along, sister, don't you feel so blue # # Way in the middle of the air # # A while to get my cat honey too # # Way in the middle of the air # # Ezekiel saw the wheel # # Way up in the middle of the air # # Ezekiel saw the wheel # # Way in the middle of the air # # And the little wheel run by faith # # And the big wheel run by the grace of God # # A wheel in a wheel # # Way in the middle of the air # # I went up on the mountain top # # Way in the middle of the air # # And I'm making my way to go flippety-flop # # Way in the middle of the air # # Ezekiel saw the wheel # # Way in the middle of the air # # Ezekiel saw the wheel # # Way up in the middle of the air # # And the little wheel run by faith # # And the big wheel run by the grace of God # # A wheel in a wheel # # Way in the middle of the air # # You see that sister dressed so fine # # She ain't got heaven on her mind # # Ezekiel saw the wheel # # Way up in the middle of the air # # Ezekiel saw the wheel # # Way in the middle of the air # - What are you doing? - Loosening my corset. Makin' room. I's gonna eat a whole side of beef. No eating before the dancing is over. By then I's gonna waste away to a ghost. Ghost? Who said that? You'd better go fill my tub. It's getting late. And Chloe, are you sure Mr. Morgan got the invitation I gave you? That's the one I stuck out and took joy in delivering in person. Is he coming? He said I wouldn't miss that circus for nothing in the world. Then he just sat back and grinned from ear to ear. He'll swallow that grin when he sees who's here. Ain't that the truth. And honey child, you's gonna look like a rose. - Classy, huh? - No beads on it? No more beads for Jenny. Now you hurry while I go see how aunt Catherine's getting along. She's the one who's going to love this party. When I get the tub full, shall I dump in plenty smellin'? I'm gonna look like a rose might as well smell like one. Oh, Catherine, you look wonderful. Oh, Jenny, it was so sweet of you to give me such a lovely dress. You're more than welcome, darling. You're going to be the belle of the ball. Oh, you're just being sweet to me. Before you came I used to think I couldn't stand it here sometimes. You've helped me over some rough spots too. Oh, dear, I'm mussing your dress all up. I had a dress something like this the night I met him. I had my picture taken in it. Would you like to see it? I'd love to. Here it is. - Just as you are now. - Oh... All but the flowers in your hair. Well, I must get some flowers. If I'm to be the belle of the ball. Catherine. Where's Catherine? She's out on the balcony. I was just picking some flowers for my hair. Your face is flushed. I was showing Jenny my picture. I'm sure you were boring Alan's wife. I wasn't bored. I've asked you not to excite her. Tonight's excitement's not going to do any harm. Gracious, I've got to get dressed or I'll be late for the party. What have you been telling her? Nothing. I didn't tell her anything. I didn't, I didn't, I swear I didn't, Julia. I swear it. Put them by the punch bowl. - Light them in the next room there. - Alright. Napoleon, when the guests start arriving... ...be sure and announce them formally. I knows my etiquette, ma'am. This is my honey child's biggest night. I's so proud I's busting clean out o' my corset. Don't you bust around here. Coz in this family we don't mention no personal articles or feminine attirement. Humph! With them highfalutin' words... ...you should get your personality whitewashed, Napoleon! Mortify yourself, woman. The guests are about to arrive. - Don't forget to play lots of waltzes. - Yes, ma'am. I understand the governor likes them. So do I. Catherine. I think that dress is much too decollet? for your age. Oh, how can you say that about my... Oh, Jenny. - Everything looks so beautiful! - Yes, as it used to look, dear, years ago. Aunt Julia, we've had our little differences, ...but you've been so wonderful about this evening. I want to thank you for helping me. Oh, that's all right, Jenny, after all, you are Alan's wife. Even so, I do want you to know I appreciate it. - A very pretty speech, Mrs. Alderson. - Why, Alan! You're not even dressed. And in nice condition for the ball. What ball, aunt Julia? Your wife's ball, of course. Have you been drinking, aunt Julia? - Or don't you have to be drunk to lie? - Alan! Nobody's coming to your party, Jenny. Not a single solitary soul. My sainted aunt saw to that. Pay no attention to him, he's drunk. Yes, Jenny, I'm drunk. But I see things clearer that way, hear things more distinctly. The sly laughs to your friends, for instance. I just found out, Jenny, ...that she's had it whispered everywhere that this is your ball. That she, and my father and your devoted husband will be out of town. That's not true. Oh, isn't there going to be any lovely party? Well, my exquisite torturess, are you happy? Too bad I had to interrupt you. By the end of this evening you'd have been delirious with joy of watching her suffer. Alan, you know I have no patience with you when you're drinking. Brigadier General and Mrs. Rodney Pendergrass. Mr. and Mrs. Philip Summerville. Miss Rosalie Henderson. Mr. and Mrs. Josephus Allenby. They's here. The guests are arriving, honey. The honorable Mr. and Mrs. Peyton Lee. Mr. Samuel Bankworth. Good evening, Mr. Lawford. Good evening. - Mr. and Mrs. Lawford. - Mr. and Mrs. Lawford. Good evenings, Your Honor. Good evening. - His Honor the Mayor and wife. - His honor the Mayor and wife. Good evening, Your Excellency. His Excellency the Governor and family. Ah-ha! His Excellency the Governor and his family. So you changed your mind about your gambling daughter-in-law... ...and decided to appear. I might ask you why your refusal became an acceptance. A political wife shouldn't answer personal questions... ...until her husband's out of office. Then I'll write a book, Stephen, and you'll know why we came. Well, that leaves only Alderman Devons who hasn't shown up. Ex-Alderman Devons. As of tomorrow. I didn't like the laws he was passing anyway. Finished with politics, Mr. Devons! You see, you were wrong about aunt Julia. I can't understand it. You will tell her you're sorry for what you said, won't you, Alan? May I? Lovely party, Mrs. Alderson. You and your wife being here tonight means everything to me, Your Excellency. Thank you, my dear. Being here tonight means everything to me. Good evening. May I? - Lovely party, isn't it, Mr. Morgan? - Ain't it? Will you have the next dance with me, Mrs. Alderson? I'd be delighted, Mr. Morgan. - Don't you just love dancing, Major? - Oh, yes... yes, of course. - Sorry to be late. - Oh, that's alright. I know how hard it is for you to tear yourself away from Delores. Lovely gal, Delores. She eats like a horse but sings like a canary. Like a canary with a croupe. My taste in women is notoriously bad. I don't like ladies. You're not a very good loser, Jackson. They're dancing for their supper, aren't they? You don't know it, honey, but they're dancing for all three meals. And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs. Alderson has been fortunate in obtaining... for your pleasure and edification this evening... a corps of French dancers who have just arrived in this country... ...after making a sensational success in a new dance which is the rage of Paris. Ladies and gentlemen, Mademoiselle Florine and her corps de dance. Cost me $2.500. I sent all the way to New York for them. Come, come, come, come, come! # Come with me and you shall see # # A new Terpsichore # # It's new and very gay # # Dance in such a daring way # # First the lady rolls her eyes # # The lady softly sighs # # Then from pauper up to king # # Everybody starts to sing # # Ta-ra-ra # # Boom-dee-?# # Ta-ra-ra boom-dee-? # # Ta-ra-ra boom-dee-? # # Ta-ra-ra boom-dee-? # You's might breeze that way sometime. Days when I's has to bear you standin' up. Break down, brother! Come on, break down. Get unreliable. Oh Pa, Ma's done it again. They like it, Jackson, they like it. And they like you too. Or else. Wake up, honey baby. - Wake up, honey. - Go away, Chloe. - I don't want to wake up. - Party's over, honey. Just leave me with a memory and a busted head. Then it was real. If you had my head, you wished it wasn't. And that Napoleon! Baby, when that man loosens up he just dissolves. - Such a beautiful party. - Get up, now, honey. Miss Julia's downstairs. Says she wants to see you right away. - Miss Julia? - Yessum. - What does she want? - I don't know, hon. She just told me she wanna see you. - Give me my robe. - Don't move so fast, honey child. Gotta get the corn liquor wrung out o' my eyeballs fore I can see ya. - Go back to bed. - I can't. Unless I's gonna find a bed that'll spin with the room. Everytime I lays down that floor raise up, looks me in the eye and snares. - He's a beauty. - He's yours, Jenny. - Mine? - With a horse of your own... ...you'll be able to get around more. - But aunt Julia... - As you said yesterday, we have had our little differences, but that's all in the past. - I hope you'll accept him. - Oh, accept him? Whoa there. I'm sorry you're in trouble, Mrs. Dixson. I know now why the horse brought me down this road. Back there at the turn he made a turn before I had a chance to. Mrs. Alderson, my dark is not accustomed to seeing ladies drive. It's disturbing him. Would you let him get back to work? I'd like to be home in time to dress for dinner. Well, you hop right in here and I'll get you home before you can say bustle. You're awfully kind but I prefer to wait for my own driver. After all, Jack Morgan's not here to threaten my husband... ...into making me do something I have no desire to do. - Jack Morgan? - Yes. It was a lovely party, Mrs. Alderson. And I sent my note of appreciation... ...to Jack Morgan. - Where's Morgan? - Well, if it ain't sugar! So, you insist on sticking your nose into my business. - Now look, baby... - For the last time, stay out of my life! Jen! I don't know how Miss Jenny got here. She must have walked the horse all the way, I'm sure. 'Cause that horse is... Miss Jenny, miss Jenny! You hadn't ought to get in that carriage. I told Miss Julia when I sold her the horse that... Wait! Mr. Morgan, that's the horse I sold the Aldersons for stud. I'm not interested in the horse's married life. - But that horse is blind. - Blind? - Are you sure? - I'm not sure but I'm certain. I told Miss Julia when I sold her the horse. Jen! Jen. Miss Julia! Mr. Alderson! What is it? What's this? What's the matter here? She got shaken up a bit, sir. Terrible! Bring her right over here. What's happened to her? Apparently your wife's had some kind of accident. - She sure has, ma'am. - Get some smelling salts, Alan. - Here, give her this. - Napoleon, send for Dr. Childers. Yessum. I guess I... I guess I lost control of my horse. You reckon you're alright, Jen? Yes, I'm alright. What are you doing in this house? - I told you down there... - Yes, I know. Well, I meant what I said. The Aldersons don't care for your company. And neither do I. Alright, Mrs. Alderson. You wanted society now you've got it. And you can keep it. But we're changing the advertising down at the King's Club. I don't want quality there. Because you and your relatives might try to get in. And I don't want any part of you or them from now on. Glad we understand each other at last. When you go driving after this, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Look him square in the eyes and you'll find he's blind. Blind? Blind as a bat. Miss Julia ought to know. The veterinarian told her when she bought him. Goodbye, gentle people. You knew that horse was blind when you gave him to me. - Julia! - You can't believe that. It's obvious the veterinarian made a dishonest deal... ...and is trying to squirm his way out of it. Yeas, that's it. I've known the old scoundrel for years. You've also known your sister for a number of years, Mr. Alderson. Yet, from the look on your face you're not quite sure what she could be capable of. - Young woman. - Let her finish, Stephen. She seems to have some odd fixation that we wish her harm. Just why exactly? Because I'm Mrs. Alderson and you can't stomach it. Because there's something awful wrong here at The Shadows. Something I see in your faces when you... ...you don't think I'm looking at you. The terrible something that changed aunt Catherine... from a beautiful young girl to a... ...frightened, helpless old woman. Something you're afraid I'm going to find out about. That's why you dislike me. Dislike you? I despise you, just as every other decent person in this town does. And I demand that you leave this house at once. Me leave? Why, I own the place. Oh no, aunt Julia. I'm not gonna leave. You are! You and any other Alderson that wants to leave with you. Did you ring, ma'am? Take that toddy up for Miss Jenny. Yessum. Oh, Julia, that's my job fixing Jenny's toddy. Napoleon, do as you're told. But you never fixed it for her before. Now don't be childish. Julia, your shoes are muddy. - You've been to the swamp. - Yes. I went down to see how bad the poison hemlock was. One of the pickaninnies ate some of the berries by mistake and died. I must have it cleared out. Julia! That wasn't mint. It was hemlock. You put hemlock in that toddy! You want to kill her like you killed my David. Let me go! Let me go! I want you to be quiet. You heard what she said. That she'd throw us out. Aldersons. That barge of a woman! You hate her because she's beautiful. You're a cruel, jealous woman. You killed my David on our wedding night because you were jealous! He loved me and you wanted him. You might as well have killed me. And now you want to hurt her, but I won't let you, I won't! Be quiet! You're not going to think about Jenny Blake. You're going to think about us. About me, the first Alderson to be turned out of The Shadows. And by a stranger. You can't let that happen to me. Can you? Now, can you? Of course you can't. We're the same blood. Born in the same bed. I'm your sister. You'll never tell. You'll never tell! I'm your sister, your sister... Your toddy, ma'am. Put it over there. May I? I changed my mind since I was downstairs. I don't want The Shadows. I don't want to live here anymore. You can give it all back to your family with my compliments. Where will you go? To The King's Club? Well, hardly, after what Jack Morgan said down there. - Where will you go? - Don't worry about me. I'll take care of myself. I have before and I will again. I'm leaving here. That's all that matters. Jenny, you're a gambler. Did you ever begin playing a game for penny ante stakes... ...and then in the middle of the game find yourself playing for dollars? What are you talking about? Well, there must be some better angle on our bargain than the one we have. Maybe if we both looked forward hard enough. It wouldn't work, Alan. I've stopped fooling myself. Well, maybe in some other city. New Orleans perhaps. Where nobody knows that you're Jenny Blake or I'm an Alderson. You can't stop being an Alderson. No, I guess not. No, you have to see your way of life break apart. See your land die, and your house fall to bits. Your spirits broken and your heart incapable of anything but hate. Afraid to die but despising life. You have to see all of that, Jenny, to be an Alderson. And by Jupiter, that was a long speech and it calls for a drink. May I? Yes. Of course. You know, I've never been able to look at a full glass without drinking it. # There ain't no moon # # There ain't no sun # # In the place where time # # Ain't never begun # # The devil laughs when he picks you out # # That's what I's singin' all about # # I's carry charms 'gainst # # Murdering wives # # Stops the poisons # # And dulls the knives # # Hangman's ready and he's got his rope # Shut your big mouth, skinny bones... 'fore I mess up these steps with your remains! The place is full, auntie. I's a witness. Oh, alright. But why did this woman, this Jenny Blake from the Memphis Belle, murder Alan Alderson? What offense did this gentleman, this scion of an old and respected family commit against the defendant... ...to put murder in her heart? I'll tell you, gentlemen. I'll unfold her whole story step by step... ...till it becomes as clear to you as it is to me. How she schemed to abandon the sordid life of her gambling ship... ...to invade the precincts of high Memphis society. How she plotted with her sweetheart Jack Morgan... ...to become queen of the Carnival. How society rejected her. And how she plotted then to avenge herself... by tricking Alan Alderson into marrying her... ...but with no intention of being his wife, gentlemen. She had no need of a husband's tender love. Love she already had and continued to have from somebody else. And how for months thereafter... ...Alan Alderson endured his humiliation in silence. Until finally, desperately in love with her, and tortured beyond human ken, he sought his rightful place as her husband. And for that, gentlemen, the defendant killed him. - I demand a change of venue! - Order! The defendant has a right to a chance for her life... ...which she won't get in this prejudiced court. You're in contempt of court, sir. And I might add, Mr. Morgan. your days of demanding things in this State are just about over. You were aware, Mr. Alderson, that your son became despondent... after his marriage to the defendant, ...and that this despondency increased day by day? Yes. Would you say it was because of his wife's unwifely conduct toward him? I can't say. I don't know. You have stated that the defendant... ...was in the habit of meeting Jack Morgan clandestinely. Will you please tell us where? One evening in a secluded part of the garden. - There were other times? - Yes. Many other times. Did you ever visit Mrs. Alderson at The Shadows after her marriage? Once. You will please answer yes or no. Did she ever visit you at your gambling house? Once. You were in love with her, weren't you? I object, sir, I object! Order! Order! Kindly restate your question. You will admit that there was a sort of love between you and the defendant. Logan, I knew you were a double-crossing, no-good leech when I got you elected District Attorney. And I thought that someday I might have to remove you. But I didn't think I was gonna have to kill you. Give it to him, Mr. Jackson, give it to him! And if you need any help, you can call on us! That's right! There's nothing we enjoy better... ...than tearing district attorneys apart. - Sit down, ma'am! - Don't you shout at me! And what's more, don't you ever stand me up again! Did you see the glass of toddy in her room that night? Yessir. But I seen it there every night and there was no poison in it. I kinda sip it myself some nights when Miss Jenny didn't drink it all. And perhaps Mr. Alderson used to sip it once in a while... ...and Mrs. Alderson knew that. Nossir, he did not. Anyway, my honey child never mixed them drinks that night. Not my honey child. She wouldn't hurt nobody. She's a heart big and good. She isn't as bad as you's trying to make her. Nossir, she didn't mix them drinks. Now, Miss Alderson, I must ask you a few questions. Was it your custom to mix a mint toddy for the defendant... ...and take it up to her room every night? Yes. And on the night of your nephew's death, did you take her toddy? I... I can't remember. Now, pull yourself together, Miss Alderson, and answer my question. I'm your sister. Your sister. We were born in the same bed You will never tell. You'll never tell. Your sister, your sister. Did you take her the toddy? Yes. Did you mix the toddy yourself and know all its ingredients? Yes. And to the best of your knowledge, when you entered the defendant's room that night with the toddy, it contained the same kind and number of ingredients... ...you had used on previous evenings? Yes. # Jenny Blake # # They're gonna break your back # # Coz you come from the no-good # # Side of the track # Before I pronounce sentence upon you, is there anything you wish to say? I didn't kill my husband, and you know it. The reason I'm here convicted of a crime I never committed is because... ...I wanted to be like you. Quality. I didn't see the meanness, the cruelty, the jealousy... I heard laughter, but I didn't know how empty it was. I wanted to get away from the Flos, the Mabels and Jackson Morgans... ...because they were like myself, trash! I know now I left real people, warm people... for trash! Yes, trash that sits around hating. Sits around waiting for slavery to come back. For cottons to come back, for ghosts of their sons to come back! Zombies. The living dead who haven't the decency to lie down and stay buried. That's it, honey! Give it to 'em! Silence! Silence! You came here like vultures to see me convicted of Alan's death. To hear the scandal about Jackson Morgan and myself. Was I just his partner in the Memphis Belle or in further ventures? Even now you're still eating up with curiosity. Well move close and I'll tell you. I love Jackson Morgan and there's no law now that says I can't. You can hang me and I'll still go on loving him. Is that all? Jenny Alderson, for the willful and premeditated murder of your husband, Alan Alderson, I hereby sentence you to be taken to the place from whence you came... then to the place of execution. No, no! I lied. I lied. It was Julia. She mixed that drink. Put poison in it. She wanted to kill Jenny just as she killed my David years ago. I kept still because I'm an Alderson. But I'm glad Alan's dead. I wish we were all dead. All the Aldersons. Order! Order! I'm free! Will you... will you have me now, Jackson? Only if you'll promise to... sew my buttons and... cook my meals and... darn my socks. Alright, honey. I'll darn your socks. But I'm warning you. From now on you're gonna be known up and down the river as... ...barefoot checks. And you promised to cook, and sew and darn my socks. Why can't you keep your word? Because I'm Jenny Blake and no lady. Changing the name of this place to The Queen's Club. Everybody's saying I'm henpecked. My father'd be awfully unhappy if he heard this. Oh, go hang your father! Why, sugar, that's just what they did. Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
