- Hey, Doc. - Hi. Thanks for seeing me. My doctor moved away. His replacement won't hear of Subutex. He kicked me out the other day. - What's your dose these days? - 8 milligrams. That's pretty good. You can start cutting down now. Here's a prescription for 28 days. OK? Great. Give me your national insurance card. Remember Brahim? He hung around Gare du Nord, always wore a red scarf... Yeah... He died last week. - What happened? - They found him in the street. Either he fell or he was hit on the head. Or maybe he froze. Either way, he's dead. He told me something funny recently. He said he was against feelings. "Against feelings"? He thought feelings were shit. Useless, a waste of time. Life was too short, especially for guys like us. What do you think? I'm not sure. Our lives are short. He's right about that. But... Then again... If you take away the feelings, there's not much left. - Is this OK? - Yeah, perfect. Your copay is 7.50. Thanks, Doc. This is Dispatch. I have a new emergency. ... A child with stomach pains. The mother's really worried. Sector 1, we have a stroke. If you're in the area, can you take it? THE NIGHT DOCTOR You've been prescribing a lot of Subutex lately. In what context? I get a lot of calls from users. You mean drug addicts. Yes, drug addicts. - They pass your number around? - Probably, yes. And you prescribe Subutex for them. Exactly. Two-thirds of all substitute drugs end up on the black market. Yes, I know. - Doesn't that scare you? - It does. Do you see this as a political act? Of course it's political. Helping people nobody cares about is definitely political. I give them risk-free user kits. That's political. So is what you're doing. Making insinuations about my ethics because I help addicts on the street, that's political, too. This is just a routine summons, for now. But watch out. We're prepared to investigate further. Do you have any other questions? Fine. Goodbye. Enjoy your evening. How are my sweethearts? Did you have a good day? Daddy? Myriam is moving away. We finally got rid of her. - Don't say that! - But she's a pain. - She is? - Yes! - Where is she moving to? - Angoulême! She lies. Says she learned English when she was one. Sounds like a lie to me. And she says I eat too much at the canteen! She did? - Daddy? - Yes? I'm hungry. Out, girls. You're not allowed to park there. - Doctors are allowed to park anywhere. - Not true! Doctor! - Hi, girls. - Who's he, Daddy? A pal of mine. Hi, Pal. You're very pretty. Girls, go wait for me in the lobby. Go on! Why are you here? You can't just show up. I know, I know... Girls, go inside! Go on, I'm coming! Doctor... I really need a prescription. Please. Here. - Don't lose it. - Thanks. I found a place to live. - Really? Where? - In Villejuif. - It's clean. - That's fantastic. With my girlfriend, too. - You have a girlfriend these days? - Yeah. Mazel Tov! Thanks. Here... For you. - I can't accept it. - Sure you can. Dr. Kourtchine... the patron saint of junkies. I'm definitely no saint. Come on... Pray for us. Take it. He's one of my patients. Wash your hands, girls. I agree. That's why I put it in the notes... I purposely didn't put it in the text. It weighed it down. I put it in the second part. No homework? - Math! - Grammar! You can do it later, OK? You're working tonight? Yes. - Mommy! - Hi, honey. - How are you? - Look! How lovely! Show Daddy. They made drawings for you. Let me see. Beautiful! Is this our building? - You said you were off tonight. - I know. I'm sorry. Go to your room. I'm coming to do homework. I need to talk to Daddy first. Is Daddy working tonight? I don't know. Maybe. Yes. I can't. Are you even aware of it? - What's wrong, Mommy? - Play with your tea set. That looks yummy. Let's play "restaurant". You're avoiding me. You're laughing? - What's so funny? - Your accent. This is absurd. The girls know we're arguing. If I say "fuck you"... How's my accent now? I have real problems to sort out. You have problems? What problems? I'm dying to hear. Not in front of the girls. Get out. Take your things and go find Karim. - Take your things... - We're just arguing... It's no big deal. It's just an argument. Get the hell out! Now! It's no big deal. Don't cry, sweetness. We had an argument. It happens. You understand? People in love sometimes argue. They need to yell. It feels good. Yeah? Sacha? You're right. I'm sorry, I've been an idiot. I'll get it together. You're never home, Mikaël. You know I'm fed up. The girls are fed up, too. Something has to change. I mean it. Sorry, it's Karim. I have to answer. Hi, Karim. I have two calls for you. The first is a baby, fever of 103. The second is a 65-year-old man, epigastric pain. His son is going nuts. Sorry, but I can't. I have to see my cousin. Send Fabrice. He's in the area. Who gives a shit about your cousin? We're understaffed. Don't let me down. I promise I won't. I gotta go. Sorry, I had to talk to Karim. Mikaël? One last thing... If you come home tomorrow morning, it means you've chosen to be with us. If not, don't bother. I'm very serious. Bye. Sacha? - Hi there. - Hi. - Is Dimitri here? - In his office. Can we talk for a sec? Bad timing. Even better! - Sam, can you take over? - Sure, Sofia. Hi, Sam. All good? - They haven't fired you yet? - Not yet. - Hang in there. - I will. Good for you. What's up? Hurry up, tell me. Go on... We can't keep doing this... I don't want to anymore. What? What's so funny? You're breaking up with me? You can't. Why not? There's nothing between us. You walk in with your serious face... You know this means nothing, right? - Nothing? - Yeah. I see. Fine, I guess we agree. Is that all you wanted to say? Yeah. I have to get back. Otherwise, your cousin will fire me. Knock on his door before you go in. - Who's there? - Mikaël. Hang on a sec. Text me when it's delivered. Got it? Come on in! - They come to your office now? - Easier pick-up. - Who's he? - Never mind. What the hell? Don't leave my scrips out! I'm putting them away. - Something wrong? - Yes. The national health inspector called me in. - And? - She's threatening to investigate. - They have no proof. - I've had it. I want out. OK? They'll revoke my license. This is no joke. - You've helped junkies for years. - That's different. They're my patients. I help them clean up. You asked me to help for two months. It's been six. I'm done. No way. You can't stop now. If you do, Ossip will destroy my drugstore. Maybe even stick a knife in me. They sell our Subutex in Georgia. It's "your" Subutex. Guess the price. 200 a pill. And he gets it here for free. You think he'll just let us walk away? Find a new doctor. You know I can't. Stop it. - Here's two grand. - Are you kidding? You earned it. It's your money. Please take it. I do this to help you, not for the money. Buy Sacha a gift, like I do for Sofia. Isn't she gorgeous? Go on, take it! Look, if you're too scared, set up a meeting with Ossip. I'll explain why I want out. - Or I can call him myself. - You can't talk to him. He's crazy. - See you later, right? - What for? My birthday. Shit... - Did you forget? - Well... I... - Happy Birthday! - You idiot! I rented a club near Montparnasse. Bring Sacha. She won't come. - Why not? - We had a fight. Just make up and come to the party. Do my tie for me. I can never do it right. Italian-style, right? Here you go. - You look like your dad. - Shut up! - You look great. - Will Sofia think so? So... Make the call. No more prescriptions. I'll call him. Thanks. And happy birthday. Emergency Physician Karim Dispatcher Hi, Karim. - You free now? - Yeah. I'll do the epigastric guy. - Too late. Marie got it. - Damn... I have a woman with leg pains in the 19th. Great, I'll take it. After that? A 43-year-old woman in the 18th. Skin wound. Call me later. I have lots more. Everyone's sick. You're the boss tonight. Don't worry, I'm the boss. Speak to you later. Bye. Good evening. Dr. Kourtchine, the night doctor. Did you call? - For my mother. - What's wrong? She's having bad pains in her leg. - Is this the first time? - No, but it's worse than usual. I'm her daughter. Hello, I'm Dr. Kourtchine. Good evening, Doctor. How long has she been in pain? It's gotten worse over the past three days. She can feel her calf blowing up and getting harder. May I touch? Does it hurt here? Her vein is hard as a rock. - Any chest pains? - Lots of pain. OK. Take her to the hospital. She needs an echocardiogram. It's the only way to know. Excuse me... - I need to take this call. - Of course. - May I go next door? - Please. I can't talk. I'm with a patient. Tell me over the phone. What's up? I'm at 7 Rue d'Aubervilliers. I'll be done in 20 minutes. See you soon. Hey. Can you grab a quick coffee? I'm busy. I have other patients to see. What's up? I'm really sorry. I get why you want to stop. I apologize. You're the one taking the risks and you're doing it for me. I'm in deep shit with Ossip. What did you do? - I borrowed money. - You idiot! - How much? - Enough. Enough to cause trouble. I had a chance to get in on a deal buying wholesale meds. The pharma companies were in on it. We'd buy cheap, up the margins and I'd get rich. I'd buy an apartment for Sofia. She's the love of my life, you know. But I'm jinxed and the deal fell apart. Ossip helped me out so I wouldn't lose the drugstore. Where does all your money go? What's your problem? You asked me to write scrips to help you out. But it's never enough. You want more. I do it because I'm scared for you. Now you owe money to some Georgian... I'm done, Dimitri. I can't take care of you anymore. I love you. You know I do. - But I have my own life. - I know. - I told Ossip I could do Fentanyl. - What? Have you lost your mind? If I get some, I can pay him back. You want Fentanyl, on top of the Subutex? That shit kills 60 000 people a year in America alone. You want to get involved in that? Please, Mikaël. Just do it. Then, I'll leave you alone. No way, never. Forget it! Never. You hear me? Fine, never mind. Forget it. I shouldn't have asked. I'll sort it out. You'll still do a little Subutex, right? Can they can call you later? And then I'm done. - You're the best. - Last time. I love you, cousin. You're coming tonight, right? Yeah, I'll be there. Look good. Not like you look now! See you later. How do you feel? Now that you're here, - I feel better. - Let's take a look. - Are you OK? - I'm fine. Try to relax. I try, but I never seem to manage. Really? Why not? I wish I knew. Tell me if I squeeze too tight... It's fine. You can hit me. Or yell at me. I'd hit you. Or stick your fingers in my eyes. That's horrible! Perfect. 140 over 80. - Isn't that a little high? - No, it's fine. - It's high for me. - How long have you been anxious? I've always been anxious, but... This time, it came out of nowhere. Like a panic attack. May I check your prescriptions? Of course. I'll get off on this side, where my slippers are. Wait, I'll get them for you. No, don't trouble yourself. - Don't get up by yourself. - Thank you. Careful... where are they? - In the bottom drawer. - Wait... I'll do it. Pull it all the way out if you can. It's all mixed up. We'll sort through it. - I'm fishing around. - Go ahead. - It was here. - It's not this one. - There! - It looks like it. Yes, that's the one. This is fine. Keep taking it. - Is this you? - It sure is! - I was 36. - Really? - What a good-looking couple! - He was pretty handsome. Excuse me. - My eyesight is getting worse. - Really? Would you like the name of an eye doctor? No, I have one at the Rothschild Foundation. - Where are you? - Meet me in 20 min. Here. Read them to me. - What, the names? - Yeah. Fabio N'Congo. - Khalid Mektoub. - What? Khalid Mektoub. You see last night's game? PSG vs. Juventus? - Nope. - Not a fan? Here. They nailed us at the very last minute. - Stole the game... - You're distracting me. I wonder where you get all these cards. What do you care? - There's no Fentanyl here. - I don't do Fentanyl. They told me Subutex and Fentanyl. - I don't do Fentanyl. - Yes, you will. I need Fentanyl now. I need Fentanyl, for fuck's sake! Get the fuck out! Take your scrips and your cards! Get lost! You're in trouble, motherfucker! Hi. How's it going? Good. Is Anna here? - Yeah. - I'll go find her. You some want water? It's Mikaël. - Hey. - What are you doing here? I missed you. The last time I heard that, I owed the guy money. What's wrong with him? This gentleman says he's having trouble breathing. Hi, I'm Dr. Kourtchine. I used to work with Dr. Viard. - How do you feel? - Pretty good. I have two doctors all to myself! You're a lucky man. I can't get this thing to work. I tried on every finger. - No go. - Can I take a look? Give me your hands. They're frozen. Warm his hands up a bit. Hervé, tea please? This little sensor reacts to your fingertip. Here's some tea. Hold it tight. This will warm you up. - That's much better. - Let's try again. You can drink the tea, too. It's working. 97. Nothing to worry about. Nothing serious, just a little rush of anxiety. You're like me. You come here when you don't feel good. I'll wait for you outside. Take care, sir. I'll be right out. I'm closing because he's cold. Neighborhood Healthcare Unit So, what did you want to tell me? I was wondering if you were hiring. - You want to work here? - I think so. On the day shift. You said someone was leaving and I thought it might be a good idea. Chloe is running the team now. You'd have to ask her. You think it's possible? I don't see why not. Why now? I'm sick of working alone. I've heard you say that plenty of times. I feel like I'm drowning. That's not a good sign. I've heard you say that too. This time, I'm serious. Actually, I'm asking you for a favor. I have to get going. - I'll walk a bit with you. - Sure. Still working with your junkies? Someone has to. You be careful. You can't save all of them. I know. I'll talk to Chloe. Meet us around 1 am. Team meal at the Parigot. Thanks. No problem. May I take a look? Is everything OK? Please sit down. Everything is fine. Sit down and stop worrying. I think she's fine. Really. He's always worried. Yes, I'm worried. What happened? Did you fall? Yes, in the kitchen. - I bumped into the table. - Is it broken? I don't think so. Stop worrying so much. When we met, in the eighties, he worried. When we moved to Paris, he worried. When I gave birth, he worried. He's always worried. Even when everything's fine. He's worried because he loves you. I don't understand how he can be happy and worried at the same time. Isn't that strange? Other than her hand, is she in good health? Would you like me to examine you? You seem very... It's true. You're the one who looks sick. Hi, it's Sacha. Leave me a message. Hi, Sacha. I just wanted to say I miss you and I love you. And most importantly, everything will be fine. You'll see. Everything will be fine. No doctor will agree to see me. You'll be OK. If you have a problem, call me. Can you hand me that scarf? - This one? - Yeah, I'll take it. - Hey, you're here! - Yeah, I made it! You didn't change. No sweat. - This is Mikaël. - Hi. He's my cousin... Night doctor and benefactor of mankind. He's the genius, I'm the salesman. - Can I talk to you for a minute? - Sure. What's up? - Did you call Ossip? - No. - You didn't? - No answer. Let's call him now. Don't bug me. I'll do it later. Birthday time! Come on... Stop worrying. You worry too much. I'm so touched by everyone's presence. You all mean so much to me. Liar! I wanted to seize this opportunity to say a few words to Sofia who means even more to me. Sofia, I've waited my whole life to meet a girl like you. You're so incredible, so funny, so smart... I want everyone to know I think you're an extraordinary woman. With a pharmacology degree to boot! When you walked into my store, I knew my life would change forever. Now it's about to change even more, for the both of us. This may seem... a bit old-fashioned, but I want to do it right. Will you marry me? He's crazy! You're crazy! So, will you? Yes? Say yes! OK. She said yes! Come on! Let's go. Run away together. Right now. Mikaël! Leaving already? Sorry, I have patients to see. - You weren't having fun? - It's a busy night. Sure, I understand. You'll give the guys the Subutex scrips, won't you? - Yeah, I'll do it. - What about the Fentanyl? - What about it? - Do it. You don't get it, do you? No Fentanyl! You're putting me in deep shit. I almost forgot... I got you a present. A PSG scarf. Since you're a big fan... You'll save every junkie in town, but you won't help me. That's bullshit! Things have changed between us. Maybe they have. Hey, it's Sacha. I've been trying to reach you but you're not answering. I called Karim. He's been trying too. What's going on? I got your message earlier. I'm sorry I yelled. I hate it when I'm like that. Call me back? Love you. Get in. Hi there. You have the cards? - How many Subutex? - I just need Fentanyl. I don't do Fentanyl. Don't you people talk to each other? - You still want Subutex? - Yeah. You OK? Yeah. That's a bad cough. You want me to examine you? - I'm fine. - It's your lucky day. I'm a doctor. Take off your jacket. Turn around. Pull up your t-shirt please. Sorry, this may be a little cold. Breathe deeply through your mouth. That's it. Slowly. You can get dressed. I want to check your throat. Open wide. You have a pulmonary infection. Take this. It won't get you high. It's an antibiotic. - What's your name? - Nadège Rocher. I can recommend a place where you can get help. You're young. You can beat this. I don't think so. You're young, you really are. How long have you been using? Since high school. I started taking codeine with a friend, then we moved on to other stuff. Like what? Bromazepam... Tramadol, cough syrup, Oxy, Diazepam... You should be a pharmacist. You know all the names! What did you do after high school? We came to Paris. We slept in squats, met people, hooked up with dealers... We lived with a Georgian for a while. Who's that guy? My bodyguard. He'll take the scripts to Ossip. Here. This is for the antibiotic. This is the Subutex. Be careful. Hold onto it. I like you, Doctor. You're having trouble breathing? Do you feel any... tingling in your hands or your legs? No, it's just my breathing. And my head hurts a bit. Understood. Let's check your pulse. - Is it OK? - Very good. - Really? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Your heart rate is normal. I'll give you something to relax you overnight. It's very mild. Sometimes I feel like my heart is about to explode. Don't worry. Your heart won't explode. You must see lots of anxious people at night. Yes, quite a few. Times are tough. Yes, they are. I'll just leave this here. Are you OK, Doctor? - You're a musician? - I play the piano. Do you like music? I do. Would you like me to play something mellow for you? I insist. I'd really like to. Come over here. Sit down. Please. I'll play something soothing. Listen. Just sit there while I play. Hey... Did I wake you? It's OK. Look at this. You recognize it? Our very first apartment. It's beautiful. Beautiful, huh? Sacha... Everything will be fine. You'll see. I'll come home and... I'll be there for you. - I'll stop working nights. - OK. - You don't believe me? - Not really. You'll see. I swear. - You should get some sleep. - OK. Sweet dreams. I love you. You know that, don't you? Goodnight. - I love you. - Bye. Is there a problem? Shit! Look who's here. There he is! Yasmine, you met in the truck... This is David, who works with us. Nice to meet you. It's late! Where the hell were you? This one patient... It took a while. He sleeps with his patients. Night doctor and gigolo. Busy day! This is Mikaël. I told you about him. - Anna says you want to join us? - Yes, that would be amazing. - The pay is shit, you know. - I don't care. He doesn't care! - He's hired! - We lost our funding. So, we may get shut down. I'll take that risk. Strange friend, Anna. That's Mikaël for you! I want to do some good. You already do something good. - We'd love to have you. - Really? If Chloe says so... OK, great! Hi there. - You're not going to introduce me? - Sorry, of course.... This is my friend, Sofia. Hello. Meet Doctors of the World. Most of them. Hi there. May I join you? Welcome! - Want to eat? Our treat. - No thanks. I'm not hungry. But I'd love a drink. Cheers to you! Remember that university newspaper? Medicine and Utopia. Mikaël and I wrote articles. We were the intellectuals in the gang. Especially me. Vaguely Marxist militant essays. No, they were definitely Marxist. - I didn't know you were a Marxist. - I was. "Vaguely Marxist", she said. And he wrote poetry, too. Very bad poetry. You remember when we cleaned up a homeless shelter in St. Denis? The place was infested with body lice. We needed strong products. Mikaël and I stole 50 bottles of Stromectol from the drugstore. We were interns at the time. When we left the shelter, we were all scratching ourselves like crazy. I bet there were bedbugs. I'm terrified of them. Sometimes, after a house call, I strip in the car and disinfect myself. Is that her? Yeah. She's very pretty. Don't promise her anything. Who'll drop me off? I will. I'll call you, Anna. - Bye, Sofia. - Goodbye. Surprised to see me? I used my best voice on your dispatcher. He told me everything. He shouldn't have. Why not? He can't keep his mouth shut. And it never ends well between us. Bastard. So, what now? I have patients to see. Take me with you. - To see my patients? - Yes. What's your name? Aladdin. What's the problem? Terrible stomach pains. They're not going away. Can you lie down? Tell me if I hurt you. A little? Sit up. Deep breath. Mikaël? I want us to run away together. Karim Dispatcher 4 missed calls What the fuck? Where were you? Sorry, I just stepped away. Sacha's looking for you! - Your cousin is at your place. - Dimitri's at my place? What did you do? Sacha's furious, man. You better hurry! I'm on my way. Thanks. Later. Damn you, Mikaël! Where the hell were you? He's been here for an hour. - Where is he? - The bathroom. Get him out of our house. - What are you doing here? - I freaked out. Got paranoid. I wanted to make sure everyone was OK. Sacha, the girls... I fucked up. Not in here. Let's go on the balcony. What happened? I tried... I called Ossip and told him my doctor wanted out. - He went nuts. - What? He'll destroy your home if you don't write the scrips. We have to call the cops. - No. - Yes! It's time to call the cops. We can't. Do the Fentanyl. You want Ossip to show up here? You know what he'll do? He'll take it out on Sacha and the girls. Write the scrips. Just do it! Fine. I'll do it. Call this number. Nadège has the insurance cards. I'll let Ossip know. You're doing the right thing. You really are. You're leaving? What's going on? What have you done? - Nothing... - Stop saying that. I thought you were cheating on me. I have to go. Go. You should. Hi, Nadège? This is Mikaël. Dr. Kourtchine. Send me your address. I'm on my way. Is Nadège here? Who's Nadège? Let's do the prescriptions in my car. Hang out a little. I don't have time. - Let's go. - Come on, dance! I'm in a hurry. Get in the car. Wake up! Look at me. Look at me. - What are you doing? - Going to the ER. Stay with me! Look at me! Hey, how old are you? How old? Eighteen. What? - You saw her? It's done? - No, it's not! She's OD'ing! I'm taking her to the ER. - Where? - La Pitié. I'll call you later. Nadège, look at me! I need a doctor please! - What's wrong? - She's overdosing. - I need your help. - Stretcher! What did she take? A mixture of pills and alcohol. She was conscious ten minutes ago. OK, let's get her on a drip. Are you a doctor? Do an EKG. I'll be right there. Can you hear me, Miss? Breathe. Make a fist. Hey there. You're strong. You'll see. They'll take care of you. You'll be fine. You OK with that? Excuse me. We need to move her. Here... Take this. It'll bring you luck. Excuse me, sir. Feel OK? Yeah. I need to get Ossip's number from you. You have it? Tell me where he hangs out. What restaurant? What neighborhood? Thanks. So? The scrips? - Back off. - Write them! No, I won't. You hear me? Yes, you will. Write the fucking scrips! Now! Forget your damn scrips! I'm gonna find you... and I'm gonna kill you! A coffee, please. - Are you Ossip? - What do you want? I'm Dr. Kourtchine. Dimitri's cousin. What are you doing here, pal? Fuck! Don't move. I said, don't move! Quit threatening me and my family. You scare my cousin, but not me. I won't do the Fentanyl. Got it? - What are you talking about? - Get off our backs. Dimitri, too. He'll pay you back. I'll help him if I have to. Pay back what? His debt. What debt? What he owes you. Your cousin doesn't owe me anything. What about the Fentanyl? I never asked for Fentanyl. I don't do Fentanyl. What? Now get the fuck out, pal. Before I kill you. Now! Get out! You piece of shit! Why? I owe the whole world money. What choice did I have? I'm sorry, cousin. I fucked up. Can you forgive me? I never want to see you again. I'm not running away with you. I know that. It's Mikaël. Can I say a few things? You know... I've never stopped loving you. I love you. Being with you is the best thing that ever happened to me. And the most important. And the most beautiful... Can I come upstairs? I'd rather you didn't. I'll go back to my car and rest a bit. I'll be back later... On the intercom, I mean. Just to say hi and chat a little with... with Anouk and Rachel. OK? Talk to you later. - Wait a minute. - Yes? I'll come down. I'll be waiting. Hey, you son of a bitch! Oh, shit. Are you OK? - What's wrong? - I just... It's nothing. I think I was just stabbed. It's no big deal. I'll call an ambulance anyway. OK? I'll be right back. 16 Rue des Annelets. A 40-year-old man whose been stabbed. In the stomach. It's bleeding a lot. No, but he's a doctor. Maybe he knows what to do. Don't worry, it's nothing Sacha... - What do I do? - Apply pressure. - Press hard. - I'm hurting you. No, you're doing great. I have to lie down or I'll faint. Go ahead. Lie down. - It'll be OK. - Yes, it'll be OK. It'll be just fine. Look at me. I love you so much. So very much. Everything will be fine. Everything will be fine.
