Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad Bu Yeogu's camp, Hanseong, Baekje Break up your army. My father died an unnatural death. So did my brothers. Can you bring them back to life? So, do you intend to sacrifice many soldiers for Wiryegung's revenge? Were you such a foolish person? Jin Jeong, Jin Godo and Jin Seung. The Jin clan that you care so much for have joined this foolish person. So have the Yeon clan, Guk clan and other nobility clans. How is this just revenge for Wiryegung? You should be begging for mercy. -Why are you being so arrogant? -Keep quiet. Father. Since when was Baekje Eoraha's country? Baekje is a country of King Chogo's line, King Goi's line and the nobility. It doesn't become your country because you conquered a third of the peninsula. Take a careful look at why the Jin clan and the nobility are in a rage. Then you will know why we implemented this great plan. You call this a great plan? It's a rebellion that can only be punished by death. I told you to keep quiet. A servant has to have a mouth to advise even if it puts his life on the line. A king has to close his mouth and open up his ears. Why don't you say something? What do you think of her actions? Since you can't answer, I will. It is a shameful act of revenge. Revenge against Eoraha for losing your son and revenge against Wanwoldang. The nobility is just an excuse. The two of you wait outside. Father. Everyone, leave us. Am I wrong? No. Then you should stop. You have no cause because Yeogusu is still alive. Yeogeun. Father, mother. I looked for you. Prince. You can't call us like that now. You're a prince. Nothing changes because I'm a prince. I will always be Soekkop to you. Please help the Wiryegung ruler. Mother. She's your mother and Prince Yeogwang is your cousin. They are your family. Save them. Even if my uncle Jin Godo is helping you, you can't defeat me. I didn't know Goguryeo would be defeated so easily. You wouldn't be so confident if Sayu was still alive. So, are you going to kill everyone? My uncles, my loyal servant Seung, Guk Naho and Yeon Dosuk. It was their choice. Do the soldiers have to die because they met an improper leader? Do they have to be sacrificed by friendly forces? As you said, it's because they met an improper leader. Is it alright if Yeogwang dies, too? I saved Wiryegung before, but I can't this time. Wiryegung could disappear without a trace. He'd rather die as an honorable descendant of King Goi's line. I will give you until noon tomorrow. Settle this matter. Eoraha. The rebellion will be suppressed before the sun sets. Wiryegung will be annihilated. The Jin clan, Guk clan, Yeon clan and Hae clan will disappear from Baekje. It won't be that easy. No, since my uncle is leading them. Many Baekje soldiers will die. Not in Goguryeo, but in Baekje. In a land with Soseono's wish. Are you going to shed blood in our 400-year-old capital? Neither of us will be free from the tears of the remaining families. Our sins of killing our brothers won't be washed away even after we die. I received the final notice. I will go and wipe my soldiers' swords and provide food for them. One more thing. What about Yeogusu? If you die along with Wiryegung, he won't be able to live with that. Do you still wish to continue? Let me ask one thing, too. Go ahead. Is this why you sent him to me? Was it to make me waver, so I'd stop the rebellion? No. You had his identity kept secret and made him Wanwoldang's son. Why did you let the truth be known now? I thought you'd never be able to see each other if I waited. That's why. Jwapyeong. Wiryegung camp, outside Hanseong Jwapyeong What happened? She met Eoraha and left Guji. Do you know what they talked about? They met in private. This is Eoraha's command. At noon tomorrow, we will join the Liaoxi Gungong and annihilate the rebels. What is our strategy tomorrow? There is none. Commander. What do you mean there is none? How can a great commander say such a thing? You want us all to die? Exactly. Godo. We are fighting Eoraha. He conquered Mahan and Goguryeo. No strategy will work against him. All we can do is fight for our lives. He's right. Prince Yeogwang here, uncle here, dalsol Guk here, dalsol Yeon here, jwapyeong Hae here and me here. Maintain your positions and fight to your deaths. That is our strategy. Your Highness. Eoraha, you can't annihilate Wiryegung. Even if you kill all the other clans, you can't kill Wiryegung. The rebellion started there. When Wiryegung is suppressed, the Wiryegung ruler will have to be executed. Please save her for the sake of Prince Yeogusu. He won't be able to live if she dies at your hands. I have no choice. Eoraha, please reconsider. Eoraha, please forgive her. Later generations will say Eoraha was a great hero. He conquered Liaoxi and Mahan and killed the king of Goguryeo. You killed Sayu, but Eoraha will receive the credit for that. But what about his life? He lost his father and had to watch his mother die. He lost the throne to Wiryegung and watched his brothers die. What do you want to say? Do you intend to kill his uncles and cousin and King Goi's line to cause him pain? Eoraha has a filial son. Your Highness. You're only looking at things from Eoraha's view. You wouldn't say that if you looked at things from Wiryegung and the nobility's view. Wherever you are, whoever you're with, Yeohwa, you are my wife. Stop it. I can hear father's voice. Why can't you? I can't hear it. Even if I did, it doesn't mean anything to me anymore. Please stop this. I'm begging you. If you roll a rock from the top of a mountain, it doesn't end up where you expected it to. I might have rolled the rock, but it won't head in the direction I want. Then I will try to stop this. I will take the lead in tomorrow's battle. You can't. I don't want my father and brother to shed any more blood. Father suffered enough in his life. I want him to live a prosperous life as a great king now. I'll say my goodbye now. Tomorrow? Wanwoldang, Hanseong Palace Yes, the battle will begin at noon. Here is the strategy. Put Prince Yeogusu in the lead. Yes. That is too cruel. Wiryegung is his family. You can't make him take the lead to kill his family. It also has to do with Yeogeun's throne. Yeogusu can't be crown prince even if you don't do that. Wiryegung started this rebellion. He will be affected. It's too cruel to put him in the lead. He has to take the lead. Birang. I feel sorry for him, but Eoraha didn't designate Yeogeun as crown prince yet. To the people, Yeogusu is your son and a hero who killed Sayu. He qualifies to be crown prince even if he doesn't want to be. He is right. I will take the lead tomorrow. Yeogusu. Don't try to stop me. I have to do this for Baekje. Neither of us will be free from the tears of the remaining families. Our sins of killing our brothers won't be washed away even after we die. I will take the lead in tomorrow's battle. Your Highness. I'm alright. Please forgive me. It's all my fault. I followed the jwapyeong's order and tried to kill Yeogusu. I guessed that much. Please don't be disappointed with Eoraha. The fault was with my lord and me. Just kill me and tell the soldiers to put down their swords for Prince Yeogusu. Listen to your nonsense! My lord, it's been a long time. You don't have to call him your lord. He is the cause of all this. He can't be your lord. He made Her Highness and Prince Yeogusu suffer. If you disobeyed a command and fled, you should have stayed hidden. You dare to show up and talk a bunch of nonsense? Wiryegung You want us to break up the army? Are you saying you want to give up the rebellion? I don't know how the Jin clan will decide, but try to convince them. When the sun rises, I will go to Eoraha with Yeogwang. Does Wiryegung have to bow to Yeogu again? Eoraha's soldiers are back from Nampyeongyangseong. We cannot win this battle. We already lost. Did seeing him bring back your old feelings for him? Jwapyeong! Is this what women are like? Is Prince Yeogwang a burden to you now that your dead son is back? I thought you were different. Can you betray Prince Yeogwang like this? I want to put everything back in place even if it's too late. Is it because Eul Mahul said I tried to have Yeogusu killed? I will receive that punishment when our great plan is achieved. I will take my life on the day Prince Yeogwang takes the throne. No. She is trying to abandon Yeogwang. It's a battle we can't lose. If we can't take revenge, we must forget. Mother. Do you want Yeogwang to die before us? I am a woman and a mother. I can't help caring for Yeogusu. But this is also to save Yeogwang. Who said Wiryegung is in charge of life? Jwapyeong. What about my life? I stabbed the former Eoraha, my stepfather. My own father was killed by Yeogu. Prince Yeomin and Prince Yeomun's heads were displayed on the street. All of them told me to preserve King Goi's line before they died. 20 years have passed. Let's both let our ancestors rest in peace. Let's let them go. You want me to forget everything? I led Yeogwang down a wrong path because I was foolish. The soldiers who fight each other tomorrow could be brothers and friends. I just want to prevent horrible deaths. There is something Eoraha made me realize. Baekje isn't a country of nobility. It isn't King Goi or King Chogo's country. It is a country of the people. Nobody can demand the blood of the people for a battle like this. Break up the army. I can't go along with the Jin clan anymore. I'm going to take our soldiers and beg for mercy to Eoraha. Me, too. We can't put our lives on the line for a battle we can't win. We will surrender to Eoraha. If you say that, what about us? You should do the same thing. What is it? Yeon Dosuk and Guk Naho will be executed for leaving the camp. You can't do that. The soldiers will waver. Their soldiers amount to 3,000. I need loyal soldiers, not soldiers who keep changing their loyalty. This isn't the time. There is a time for everything. It's not too late to kill them after the battle is over. Is the Jin clan wavering, too? Prince! Why don't you understand what my uncle is saying? We can't fight without their soldiers. If you kill them, their soldiers will flee before sun rise. Nobody will leave. I won't let them live. Cut off their heads! Yes, sir! Yeogwang, you're just a tiny fish compared to Eoraha. I am dying because I was foolish to join you. But Wiryegung will end up like me when tomorrow comes. Cut off their heads! Commander, jwapyeong, I am disappointed with you for involving us. Why didn't you wait for me? Bring me a grinding stone. I'm going to sharpen my sword. Commander! What should we do? What is it? The Yeon clan and Guk clan soldiers are fleeing. We have to stop them. They're running for their lives. How can we stop them? Our soldiers are wavering, too. A young little fish who can't handle soldiers is ruining our great plan. I have a request to make. You want to take the lead? It is my duty. I shouldn't have brought you here from Gongna. I promised to be your sword and conquer Goguryeo. I kept half of that promise. Goguryeo hasn't been conquered yet, but I have no regret because of Yeogeun. I have one request. What is it? I promised Wanwoldang that I'd let her punish the Wiryegung ruler. Please tell her to go easy on the Wiryegung ruler. This is my final request. Give this to Eoraha. Bring jwapyeong Hae on the way back. Yes, Your Highness. I'm very thirsty. I'd like a cup of tea that you make. Yes, Your Highness. Hanseong Palace Mother, it's been a long time. Seeing you brings tears to my eyes. Thank you for returning like this. Honey. Princess, hello. You ran away for 2 years just because I scratched your face? What's the use of achieving merit? You're a terrible husband. I'm very sorry. You can catch up later. What is Eoraha's message? The battle is beginning soon. The rebels could come to the palace. He said to lock up the gates and be prepared for anything. I understand. I will remain here and protect mother and the princess. Who is taking the lead today? Prince Yeogusu. Did Yeogu order that? The prince volunteered. When the signal is given, annihilate all the rebels. Yes, prince! Nageunja. The only thing we can do is protect the prince. I know, but why do I feel like crying? How do you think he feels? It's time to send the signal. Eoraha! There is a message from Wiryegung. Are they surrendering? I have to go to Ungniha. Eoraha. Tell Yeogusu not to do anything until I give the order. Your Highness. Come in. I heard the Yeon clan and Guk clan soldiers fled after the dalsols were killed. Why didn't you break up the army? We already crossed the river and the boat is damaged. How can we cross the river again and coexist with Yeogu? It's my fault. Not yours or Yeogwang's. If that's why you wanted to see me, I'll get going. The battle will begin soon. I have to be by Prince Yeogwang's side. Give this to Yeogwang. There is no reason for me to deliver a message telling him to surrender. It's not that. I just told him how much I care for him. Leave it. I have nothing to give you. Your Highness! Your Highness! She went to see Eoraha. Where to? Bring me my horse! You'll have to kill me first. Your Highness! Your Highness! You can't leave like this. Your Highness! Why are you so late? They aren't moving. Do you know what's going on? What's this? It's a message from Her Highness. We first met here. Those were the happiest times of my life. Were they? You never know what will happen in life. I didn't know we'd end up like this. It's not too late. Stop the rebellion. Then I'm sure a day will come when you, me, Wanwoldang, Yeogusu, Yeogeun and Yeogwang will all be happy. Maybe that will be possible in the next life. Don't be born as a king in your next life. Yeohwa. Baekje is glorious because it has a great hero as Eoraha. But you weren't happy. A hero is a lonely soul. He has to suffer pain alone. Yeohwa! I have one final wish. What do you mean final wish? I caused all this. I should die. What did you do? This tree makes wishes come true. For Yeogusu, for Yeogwang, for jwapyeong Hae, for the Jin clan, for Guk Naho and Yeon Dosuk who dies for me, most of all, for you and the Baekje you dream of, I tie my ribbon to wish for a prosperous Baekje. Yeohwa! Yeohwa! Please save Wiryegung and Yeogwang in exchange for my life. I will. Think of Yeogwang as your son and take good care of him. I will. Save the Jin clan. Finally, please let me see Yeogusu just once before I go. Yeogwang, I'm leaving because I care for you. Please forgive me for making you live to take revenge for Wiryegung I hope you can live a life free of battle. Why are you doing this? How can you leave me like this? Aunt... Aunt! Yeohwa. Yeogusu is here. The son you missed so much is here. Tell him I died of a lung disease. I don't want to cause him anymore pain. Eoraha, you wanted to see me? Yeogusu. Mother. I rejected you when you came to see me. I'm sure you were disappointed with me. Can you forgive me? I yearned for you, but I wasn't disappointed with you. I always dreamed of holding you. I hoped to do so when I died. My son is here in my arms. You've become a fine man. Mother. Mother. Mother. Mother. Yeohwa. I have no regrets now. What more could I want? Don't be sad for me. I can go happy. Mother! Yeohwa. Mother! Mother... Mother... Mother... Yeogwang is going with Hae Geon to surrender. It was a lost battle. It was over when he killed Guk Naho and Yeon Dosuk. What will we do? I will go with Yeogwang. You can't bow to Wi Birang. Even if we all die, the Jin clan must survive. We would like to surrender to Eoraha. You started a rebellion to surrender like this? I am at a loss for words. Tie them up and lock them in prison. They will pay for their crimes when Eoraha returns. Eoraha didn't come out of Gomjaebyeolgung again. I'm suffering such pain. He must be suffering more. My lady. I don't have any words that could comfort your pain. Mother. Mother. Mother.
