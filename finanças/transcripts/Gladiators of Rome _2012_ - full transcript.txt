There he stood, the greatest gladiator in Rome, facing his toughest challenge yet, and the crowd roared: "finish him!" And then? With his very last ounce of strength, all the willpower he could possibly muster, with everything he had left, and... And? I got your nose! Oh no, mommy. Give it back! Okay, you can have your nose back for tonight, but only if you promise me to have good dreams with me in them, and you'll tell me about them tomorrow. To try is the best way to succeed. Good night, sweetheart. - Mommy... - An earthquake. - Mommy! - Don't worry. Oh, gods! Help me! Help me! Keep moving! Come on, hurry! Help me! Mommy? Oh... - Mommy! - Come with me, little man. - Let's go. - Mommy, no! What's your name? - Timo. - Timo, it's gonna be OK. I'll raise you alongside my daughter Lucilla in Rome. North by north west, pull together! Heave! Cover the children! Timo, motivation. You gotta have motivation! - Tweet. - About time. We got a tweet from Lucilla. "Dear Dad, I'm finally coming back home. Can't wait to hug you. See you soon, Lucilla." My daughter will be back! After all these years... Timo! Did you hear? I've gotta go. What are you doing? Not the face! - Loser. - I gotta go. - Same time tomorrow? - Timo? A little louder? A feudal dude in the next empire can't hear you. This is the only true Gladiator Academy in all of Rome. And most of you will not make it out alive. You call this training? Come on, show me a real gladiator! Cassio, you're my best gladiator. How's your uncle, today? Well, Chirone, Domitian says hi. The Coliseu m's almost built and he wants to celebrate with a tournament. And what's better than the old fashioned one-versus-all show for the Emperor of Rome? Good. I'm always pumped up by the chance to show off my guns in the arena. Come on. Cassio, you're a star. - Sorry, girls. Not right now. - Hi, Cassio. Here, it's all yours, kids. Iwasjust... Battle cry! This little piggy went to gladiator school. Your only shot at Coliseum victory is if your opponents die of boredom. I'm gonna leave it to you, fellas, OK? Did you see the forum? The thermal baths? How wonderful! It's so good to be home. Come on, Lucilla, what's wrong with you? Don't you feel good? No, everything's fine... You should be psyched! We're finally out of that boring school! I would've liked to continue my studies. Continue your... Are you kidding? What for? - You're going to marry Cassio. - The Emperor's nephew! Hug his muscles, caress his hair... Cassio... You'll travel the world, see the pyramids, visit Gaul. It's just... leaving school in order to get married? Wh at? There are other things besides muscles and money. What if he isn't the right one for me? You are weird, Lucilla. I'm exhausted. What's the matter, Goldilocks? Tired already? - Let him go! - You wanna dance, loser? - Let's dance. - No thanks, my card's all full. Make your move, tiny. - Come here! - Stop, you're tickling me! And here's what you pay to see. Need a break? Wow! Did your face just fart? Fox and onions for breakfast. Sorry. Stop fooling around! Oh, crap! I'm sorry. Munch my mud, mud-muncher! Time goes by, but some things never change, right? Timo? Hi! Cassio? Daddy! Grubbo? You're all grown up. Hey! Get back in line you blood-sucking spores! See you later, dad. Bring it here! Watch out! Careful! We need more bricks! Ave, Domitian, my emperor. Nice try, now cut it. How's the work? It's an honor... a really great honor. Your wisdom shines upon the whole Empire. Your gorgeousness rivals that of Apollo himself. And your regality is so... regal? We should have been open 16 years. We've had more blunders than blood! I want epic fights to the death but I'm choosing stones instead! My emperor, we're here to serve you. Do you want the Coliseum yesterday, or do you want it to last forever? Watch out! I'll kill you! So, did you and daddy get along well? Yeah : best bunnies, my dear. When you left to study, you were a child. Wow, look at you! So beautiful, just like your mother. It isn't right she couldn't see you marry the Emperor's nephew. Dad, I... Cassie's uncle is throwing a party for you two. An engagement party. I just want you to be happy. Only the best for my daughter! Sorry, but I have some night coaching for the boys. Get some rest. The engagement can wait, just think about it. Dad is always the same. It's so hard to talk to him. Who's there? A little bit more and... got it! Timo? - What are you doing? - We're on a full-pack hike. I snuck off. I had to see you. You look great. I look awful. Last time I saw you, you were a bony kid with pigtails and freckles. What happened? - I grew up. - I can totally see that! Nice. - But why so sad? - Long story. Does it have a happy ending? You never know. Wow, so much has changed. Yeah, for starters, no one told me you're pregnant. Too much time without you. It was a while, huh? Not that much. Well, it's only been eight years, ten months... and fifteen days. Timo, are you okay? I'm alright. Huh? Come on, let's go! Ciccius, Mauritius... Hey, guys, wait for me! By Jove, Timo, where have you been? Don't tell me you were with Lucilla. - I think I'm in love with Lucilla. - Well, you've always been. She's beautiful. And even more on the inside. You two are perfect for each other. If you were Cassio... Their families have already planned the wedding. And his family is worth a fortune. If you're happy and you know it Clap your hands Stop singing! Right now! If you're happy and you know it Clap your hands Zip it, Mr. Nightingale, I'm not kidding! - I love this song. - He's really got a lovely voice. If you're happy and you know it And you really wanna show it If you're happy and you know it Clap your hands ' Oh haPPY day... - Shut up! Say thanks to Timo and raise your pace! I want to see you fly like the wind! Come on, guys! It's not my fault! Really! You know him. Can I help it if Chirone doesn't appreciate the classics? Get out of my way. Good night, Ciccius. Good night, everyone. Sweet dreams. Why are you so hard on him? Timo is... At least, he was like a son to me. He would be extremely good if only he worked harder. He just... Why on earth does nothing interest him? - He's so apathetic. - All of which makes you angry. You haven't been here, I've done everything to motivate him. But he's been slacking off since you left. That's frustrating, but I know you love that boy. Maybe... - You could give him another chance. - Another chance is too much for me. Why can't he be more like Cassio? Speaking of Cassio... What are you thinking about? His uncle is the Emperor, we can't mess with him. But it's my life, dad... Lucilla, having Domitian as our patron is the only thing keeping us in business. And Cassio is the best fighter in Rome. He's the best match for you, my darling. I don't want to marry him, dad. I don't love him. SorfY- - Going somewhere? - I was just going for a walk. So was I. Would you like to join me? Daddy has always believed you could become a real gladiator. - What happened to you? - I was born. It was just downhill from there. - So... how was Greece? - It was very sunny. But I didn't get out much. I spent most of my time studying. - Did you learn what you wanted to? - I learned a lot, but mostly things that don't matter to me, right now. - Well, I... - Hey, remember this tree? - No. - Liar. Timo, come here! Wait for me! - Help! - Hold on, I'll help you! Are you okay? Oh, I'm sorry. This is for you. It's wonderful! Oh, not again! Wait! Daddy wants me to marry Cassio. He's a good fighter, and the Emperor's nephew. If only you'd put your heart into it, if you'd really focus, you would be the best. Hello! He kicked my butt! Isn't there anything that matters to you? - There used to be. - So what happened? - She left for Greece. - But we were kids. Getting cold, shall we go? - You'll never know if you quit now. - Know what? If the story has a happy ending, silly. Where in the end the beautiful girl changes her mind, and doesn't marry the rich champion? Doubt it. Idiot! Idiot! I'm an idiot! - You said that? - Rub it in, why don't you? Did I mention that you're a total idiot? I said that 5 seconds ago. Anyway, Chirone has already planned everything. Maybe if you beat Cassio, - it will make him change his mind. - Doubt it. "Doubt it" will be written on your gravestone. But maybe with a little help... And I think I know who can help you. I dunno... I've got a bad feeling about this. - Have we ever steered you wrong? - Yeah, you have, many, many times! - What if Chirone finds out? - Timo, I'm your friend. And I'm sorry to talk to you like this, but you're a loser. This is your only chance. What now? ls it what I said? - It's the truth! - What have you got to lose? It's cheating, a bad idea. A big steaming bowl of immorality! Ali's fair in love and war. You're getting killed in both. Alright... I'll do it. Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the most hairless of them all? - Hairless? - You? As they say... "One falsehood thrust aside another." Why not? What's wrong with me? For starters, you have a five day old beard. And you shaved this morning. - Grandma! That's seven more years, bringing your grand... - bad luck total to... - 2,401 years! I hate my life! Bat boogers, very rare. Don't worry, Grandma knows what she's doing. - If you say so! - You don't find this in stores. - I'm gonna hurl. - Taste! - Maybe later. - You're cute. - Come on, Grandma. - You can't rush genius! Know how long it took me to invent penicillin? - What's penicillin? - No idea. I also invented the blue pill. I dated a blind Phoenician pygmy who loved me to death. But don't ask! Goat's foot, lion's mane, it'll make you very strong. Try it, you'll be as strong as a beast! Drink it! Drink it! Not the fly! Gross! Drink it. It works. Here we go, Cassio! Great party, isn't it? Hi. We were young, happy, winners! Like my nephew, Cassio. Enchanté. Now it's all dinners with senators, temple openings, and repairs for aqueducts. Know how many fountains we have? No wonder the Empire keeps growing, we keep watering it! Yes... Fighting, competition, investing in those boys you train. I love it. When's your Coliseum going to be finished, Domitian? Without all the crumbling and cracks. Our tax dollars hard at work? - I'll miss her! - I'm told it will be ready soon. Is it true you're bringing killing back? Yes, the final round of the first tournament will have a life or death match! Wonderful! Those boost the emperor's approval ratings. - I don't need it, Cassio... - Enough, already. Let's cut straight to party time. Take your best shot. You deserve only the best. We all know who's the best here. Don't tell me. You're supposed to be the best? - Are you going to challenge me? - We'll see. I won't go easy on you this time. - Timo, what are you doing? - Try to stay alive... if you can. You're dead! He's on something! Give him a potion test! Performance enhancing potion. He's juicing. Pee in here, please. Okay. I can't do it with everyone watching. Go on! Could you say "pssss pssss"? - Thanks. - He's had this since he was a kid. - What have you taken? - Nothing! I swear! Not that one! It's one of a kind! Thank the gods! It's some sort of transformation potion. I won't stand for tricks like this in my outfit. You're out of the Academy for good! What... We're so sorry. We'll leave you alone. Come on, Mauritius. How could I be so stupid? Lucilla... You failed me. Please, don't do this, Chirone. You're a disgrace! Get outta my sight. But you're my only family. Is there anything you care about, anything at all? Lucilla. Stay away from her! She deserves the best. She'll marry the best, not a cheater like you. Get out and never come back! - Excuse me. - Watch where you're going. Wow... the Coliseum. Lucilla will never see me fighting here. Left turn! Keep it UP- Who's there? What did you say last time? "Try to stay alive"? Have you come to check the quote? Pathetic fool, you had to cheat to beat me. Can we talk about it? - Do you ever quit? - I don't know how to. Whereas you don't know how to try. You have no friends, and now no Lucilla! No, Cassio, please... Don't pass out on me, now. What gets me about you being dumped out of the Academy is that you'll never see me and Lucilla together. Nobody taught you that three-against-one fights are unfair? There's some for you as well, if you want. Come on. Let's g0! Who... Thanks for saving me. I feel so guilty about Timo. We made him take your grandma's potion. Grandma always exaggerates with the dosage. You should try her mutton. She stuffs it with a whole cart of garlic. Poor Timo, I wonder what he's doing. All alone, with no place to go. With nothing to eat... Don't tell me, I'm hungry just thinking about it. Shall we get seconds from the canteen? So it was Grandma's work? Thanks for the tidbit, losers! You'll pay for this too. So... did you find him? Excellent. By the way, was there a woman with Timo by any chance? Boys, you wanna grow up to be heroes? The coolest gladiators? The best of the best? Great, then go and spy on Timo then tell me what he's doing. And remember to floss. Hey... - How's it going? - Not so well. I'd like to read too, but every time I try, my head spins. Because you're holding it upside-down. I think I'll have to get more practice. Maybe with someone's help... I don't want to distract you from your training, but I can help you out. What's the sad face for? I'm really worried about Timo, I told him to try harder. - But you didn't tell him to cheat. - I fear he'll do something stupid. Knowing Timo, he will. Don't worry, I'll talk to your father. Perhaps I can make him change his mind, persuade him to take Timo back at the Academy. Thanks for everything, Cassio. Wait! Have you forgotten? Let's start with this. Who has time for this nonsense? Leftovers... yu m! Paws off, grabby! Kittie... "Are you a loser, a failure in love? Eating food from the garbage?" You got that right! "A failure, but you are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us." What about that? "Diana, personal trainer." "Emperor's nephew beat you and took your girl? I can even the odds." That's direct marketing... What... "Drop that drumstick and get your rear in gear." Let's give it a shot. Almost there. Right around the corner, right... around the corner. It's supposed to be here. Right this way... No, this way! Definitely not that way! No, I hatethese things, and they put them in every movie! Perfectly safe. One step at a time. Stop! Stop the bridge, I want to get off! It does taste like a bit like bread. Oh, great! Right into the wolf's mouth! Lovely... Spacious, pitch black, and... Hi, is that the bell? Okay, I'm leaving! Go away! What the... Looks like I made it. Wow, what do you know? Nice place. Watch that first step. - Hello. - Hi, my name is Timo. - I'm looking for... - Whatever you're looking for... you're looking at. Come inside. Do you have anything to drink? - Such as? - Any grape juice? Apple juice, orange juice, water? - Cherry? - Easy there, cowboy. Maybe later. Do you need a personal trainer to beat somebody up? Get the girl and live happily ever after? One of those deals? How fast are your reactions? - Your reflexes, are they fast? - Why? What the... Cut that out! Why don't you stop me? Look,ldon% wanna hit a woman. I really don't see that happening. Gotcha! One more sucker punch and I swear to the gods I'll... What? Huff and puff and blow my house down? We have work to do, let's not waste time. - I get half. - Half of what? The works. I train you and you give me half your earnings. Action figures, tours, sponsors, merchandising. You're a gladiator, right? That's big business. You guys are rock stars. Or you could be. What do you have to lose? What do you say? Clear your name, beat the bad guy, get the girl, and I get half. Deal? Deal. The pigs are embarrassed of you. Good night. A stable... Couldn't be worse. I knew it. It is worse! Lucilla's right, ifl really try things will get better. Morning, this is your most important weapon. Put it on. Why does it say "think"? Your mind. That's your most important weapon. Cute. Now run up that hill and fetch me water. What's the point? Exercise. Just climb and fetch me water. Way up there? Come on, it's easy. Quiet, Sparkles. He can do it. Your horse's name is Sparkles? - The clock is ticking, Nemo. - Timo. - That's what I said, Lino. - My name is Timo. - Yeah, I got it, Dino. - Timo! Whatever. Go! What kind of name is Sparkles, anyway? "Whatever. Go!" There must be giant beasts around here. Be careful, don't stumble. Darn you, leaf! Why made you leave your branch? Oh, come on! Help! Diana, help! Sparkles, go get Diana! You stupid... After we slept together in the same stall! Think... Gotcha! Thanks a lot, you're a great help. Relax, you gotta lose some to win some. "Think more?" We're in luck, because I am the perfect loser. How about that pail of water? Hit the hill. Fetch. "Think more", whatever. - So, who's the girl? - I don't wanna talk about it. There's a cockroach on the floor in front of you. Kill it. - I don't wanna kill it. - Kill it! I'm not a killer, I'm not into killing. Kill it, you yellowbellied sapsucker! Kill it! - You did that on purpose. - You just looked at the obvious. You weren't looking at what the obvious wasn't. You're a very weird trainer. I'm thirsty. You're gonna send me for another pail of water. - Aren't you? - Right. Okay. They're like mushrooms. I'm flying! Pay no attention to the man swinging on a rope. I know how it looks, but I'm not doing this to teach you. Lucilla. Stop that, Lucilla. Go away! Come back! I love you! Gino, you are smart, really smart. You... Yeah, me. Are you ready to go shopping? Move, we have lots of walking to do. All the way to Rome? It took me a day last time. Are you really that slow? Look. Shall we go... Mino? Timo, my name is Timo. - Why have we come? - What do you think? Stay here, Gino, I'll be right back. What is it? "Coliseum's grand opening. Gladiator smackdown!" I signed you into this tournament. - And I bought you this. - What? Thank you very much. It's three sizes too small, you'll fit in it when you're ready. Come on, Tino. No time to lose. Don't say a word, Sparkles. Timo's nowhere to be found, we have looked everywhere. - Cassio, I'm so worried. - Don't be, I'm sure he'll come back. Unfortunately your father... you know what he's like. - He won't take him back. - Thanks for trying. Sometimes he can be as stubborn as... As an emperor who's chosen his nephew's wedding day? My uncle insists our wedding will be after the tournament. - I've tried to play for time... - He's more stubborn than my dad. Timo better get his butt back here. It may be too late. I'll show you! I know, I have to go fetch water. I have a mission for you. Here we go! I'm not that stupid. Everything's fine. No traps... Everything's fine. And who might you be? Aren't you a cutie? Maybe it's an abandoned baby. Come in and let's have a look at you. You are the perfect toddler for my stew. These little feet will go great in my shrinking serum! Now stay there while I get my carving knife. Here we go, now pay attention. Brewing potions is an exact science. Or an inexact science, depending on what you want to do. If you mess up by the slightest bit it could spell disaster, So hold this very carefully... That is so funny! You almost got us both killed. I love you kid... boiled with a bit of garlic. Gesundheit! Filled up already? We're infested with bats! That's a pest problem. I call it ingredients! Potion's nearly ready, and now... Here we go, fresh finger nails, a touch of flavor. We're almost there. I think it's done. Taste it. What are you doing? That goblefs worth more than you. It looks fine, that means you may live. Where the... Kids... they grow up so fast. One minute they're babies, the next, they're out the door. It's freezing, yet she sleeps... and eats? That's just not fair. I really hate that horse. Be nice. One day you may need her. - Need her? How? - You know... Sparkles has... a lot of qualities. Lemme guess. No brain? Farts like there's no tomorrow? The meanest mare in the whole Empire. Coliseum's opening soon, and you have to be ready for the tournament. Why does Sparkles get a blanket and cookies? I want a blanket and cookies. If you go out without a coat in the cold, you find out what cold is. Go hungry and be lean. That makes no sense. I'm starving! Good. We'll wear away all that fat down to the lean tissue. - Then you'll see what it's about. - I don't know what you mean. The only time you define your character, is when you are forced to do without things. In times of hardship, you find out what you're capable of. If you never test yourself, you'll never define your character, you'll never win that tournament, and you'll never get Lucilla. How do you know about Lucilla? Who are you? - A thirsty girl. - What? See you later! A pail of water. Yes! It wasn't a mirage! Yes. Come on! Leave me! Get off me! - This chick sounds weird. - Tell me about it. You're losing weight. Yeah, I didn't know you cared. Cookies! I see you've put your name down for the tournament. Yeah, like I got a prayer. Cookies! Have you seen Lucilla? Wh at? - We saw her yesterday. - She was with... Cassio. Perfect. Great. Cookies! No way, big guy, you're in training. Oh, man... No, no, no! Hi, I'm Diana. I'm Choo Choo, this is Mozart. I mean Mauritius, I'm Mauritius, and this is Ciccius. I'm Shiny Shoe. - Your name is Shiny Shoe? - Who? No. - Are you single? - Gotta go, boys. Nice to meet you. Go ahead, have your cookies. Hang out with your friends. That will make you win the tournament. I'm on my way. If you ever want to resume your training, you know where to find me. I'm coming... I know it's stupid, but she has the right name. That babe, the one of the hunt. You know, Diana the goddess. She's a goddess all right. Oh yes! Go. Faster than light! Bucket. Parry! Never get distracted. Never run when not being chased. Look, what is all this? What are you trying to do? Here's the thing, Zimo. You've got it! - I do? - Yes. Sweet... Wait, got what? You're afraid of what you've got, but don't worry. One day you'll give it away, then someone else will get it. - I don't get it. - Exactly. I don't know how to tell you this, so I just will. - Is it Timo? ls he hurt? - Worse. Please, Cassio, just tell me. There's a woman. - A woman? Timo? - She's his tournament trainer. But I hear their relationship has turned into something more. - Much more. - It can't be. Who is this woman trainer? I hear she is a complete babe. A real goddess. No, I mean a real goddess. A goddess? What goddess? The tournament's tomorrow, this is your last lesson. It's called trust. Trust? What are you... Trust. Now I'll never get her back. I'll kill myself. Yes. - Hi. -Get off! Lucilla, wait! Stop! Wait! - It's not what you think. - Leave me alone. Whoa, horsey! Leave me alone! - She's my trainer. - I saw how she's training you. I'm doing this... ...for you. - Like when you took the potion. You always take the easy way out. You want to be a gladiator, but don't want to do the work. You want me but when I'm out of sight, you find someone else. Face it, Timo, you're just too easy on yourself. You always have been. I've changed. Lucilla, really, I've changed. Bravo, great move. Don't tell me you let her go? I did everything for her, and as always I screwed up. - Is this what I taught you? - Of course not! You taught me to fetch a pail of water from that hill. And? - And what? - And succeed. What's the point in succeeding if you can't share it with anybody? Hey, Mr. l-quit-at-the-first-obstacle. I didn't waste my time for you to run away like a loser. If you wanna show Lucilla, Chirone, Rome, you got your chance. Tomorrow. The tournament. What did you say? Never get distracted. And remember: it's all just for Lucilla. Not bad, go get ready. This evening we're eating out. We are going to eat? Really? Really. Nice big platter. What's in it? - A single lonely bean? - The veal chop you ordered. Tomorrow you fight. Tonight you enjoy a nice dinner. No tricks? That's beautiful. What is it? We are all much more than the sum of our parts. Just like this bracelet. The black pearl is obsidian it represents Vulcan, the god of all-consuming fire. Let go of your past. Free yourself. - Find a new beginning. - And this? Violet, Minerva's color. It brings wisdom. - And this? - This is red. Venus's color, so you can find your fire, your passion. And what about this one? Bright green, the hunting goddess's color. It represent the ability to commit yourself to what you really love. Relax, I know you love Lucilla. You have a big heart, Nino, never forget that. You are slow, awkward, but you've grown up, ready to fight for what you care for. Tickets for the gladiators! Get to know the gladiators! Don't be fooled by fakes. Official merchandise comes with real blood stains. Don't miss out. Gladiator action figures! Gladiator action figures in advance of the movie! - What's a movie? - Don't bother me, kid. Thanks... Buy your bronze bust of Cassio. Cassio's stone head. Stop! Stop! Stop! Go away! What can you tell us about this umpteenth opening? - Will there be another collapse? - We have solved... those little structural problems. The amphitheater is perfectly safe. This opening will be a huge success, you'll see. Today's contest has been much criticized. Why use gladiators from all over the world, instead of just Rome? Why not? This is globalization. The world gets small and smaller, while the Empire gets bigger. My nephew Cassio is the odds-on favorite. Put your money on him. "Ave, imperator. Morituri te salutant." Welcome to the world's biggest amphitheater: The Coliseum! Today the empire's fighters will fight each other. They are the world's most ruthless killing machines. The fight will continue until they are all out, and only one is left alive. "Only one is left alive"? - I wanted to surprise you. - Ha ha, funny. This is the greatest, most exciting, most incredible show in the whole empire. And it is just for you. Did you find it? Give it to me. I'm not an idiot like Timo, I'm not drinking that. That Will do it. Perfect. Rubbing it onto my muscles will be enough to make me win. And now... here are the challengers. From dusky Britain... From mysterious Arabia... From the Far Lands, more eastern than East itself... From the red hot dunes of Aegyptus. From the sunny Hispania! From the freezing coasts of the Germanicum Sea. From the remote lands of Africa. And finally, from the alleys of Rome, Timo. You're on your own, big boy. Make me proud. Yeah! You're great! The usual idiot. Keep an eye on that one, he cheats. The world's most dreaded warriors! Their aim is the final match. Ours is to show you the bloodiest match you've ever seen! And now it's their turn. Your favorite gladiators. The strongest fighters in Rome, they're simply... the best! Hi! Let the games begin! Watch out! Wow... Take that! Come here. Gimme more! NOW! Pin. Come here. Take these back. Come on! There must be something here. Not this... - Hey, that Lino rocks. - Timo, his name is Timo. Dodge the traps, just like she taught me. Hello. Watch your back! You had me worried, but you did good. - Thanks. - I'm not the only one impressed. He's been lucky, but he's really trying this time. - Who's she? - I don't know. She looks like somebody famous. Gimme more! I'm gonna win this tournament. Understand? Move! No! What the... I surrender. You won. There's something fishy here. He's cheating, he's using my grandma's potion. - I did it to win too. - And you paid for it. But you realized your mistake. More. I said more! Life or death, my foot! Third-grade dance performances were bloodier than this. My emperor, your mutton, goat-butter sautéed with apples and honey. And? Your fried chicken thighs with Caesar dressing. - Finally something decent today. - Yes, my emperor. If you please, I'll go and weep in a quiet corner. This time they fight to the death. In this corner, every girl's dream, every man's nightmare. The one, the only, the mighty Cassio! And in this corner, he's tough, he's too cool for school. I give you... Timo! Gentlemen, get ready. Die! Sparkles, go! - Come on. - Sparkles, go! That's it. Come on! I'm too fast and too furious for you. What now? No! Gotcha! What... Time for a little housekeeping! Look out! Check out the option package on my chariot! Look out! Gotta go, come on! Come on! I'll get you. No way! Hold it... Good horse, Sparkles. Thanks, you saved my life. A good fight needs a few surprises. Let g0! You two? We're done, but have a go at him if you like. Come back! Get off me! Stay down. This is my show, I won't let you spoil it. You're a nobody, got that? Now I'll show you. I will show you. You were kicked out, humiliated. Why are you still fighting? What for? To show her I can fight for what I care for. Lucilla's? Tough luck, she's mine. Poor Timo, the Wedding's already planned. I'll show what you're worth and she will be mine. That's my Cassio, the show I wanted. It's all about blood, gentlemen, always has been, always will. She'll never be happy with you. That's no big deal. It's all that matters to me. Stop the show, Cassids chea... He's changed into a Minotaur. Your grandma is a public menace. What's up with you? Put me down. Watch out! Okay then... I'm not like you. - Timo, no! - Stop him! Stop, Lucilla! Watch out! - You monster! - Go get him. Then you! Get behind me. Help! I'll save you, Lucilla! Trust me... trust! Guys, grab these. Come on. No. Go for it, champion. Knock him down! Timo! Let me go! What the... How'd that potion taste? As bitter as this defeat? If you run, everyone'll know I'm better than you. Loser! Come here. Got your nose! See you later. Come on, slow poke. What's wrong, huh? Can't catch me? Not again! Sparkles, are you okay? Lucilla, my darling, where are you? Answer me, Lucilla! Ruins, all in ruins! Ciccius. Mauritius. I'm fine. - Have you seen Timo? - No, I haven't. Look under the debris, quick. Lucilla, are you okay, sweetheart? I'm fine, dad, don't worry. Timo pushed me out of the away before the column fell. But I lost him and... Where is Timo, dad? Is he with you? No. He sacrificed his life to save yours. Oh no! Timo! It's not true, he can't be dead! Timo! Timo! - Timo? - Timo? Lucilla, no! - Run, run! - Stay back! - Oh, Timo... - Easy there. Lucilla, I was so worried. There was no reason, Timo was with me. You fought well, you've become a real gladiator, SOFI. You made it! What the... Wait, wait... Stop it! Get off me, you little punks! Opportunity, my emperor! What if this time we go pink? I'll show you pink! Come here. Easy, big boy, remember? We said fifty-fifty. But since we can't share this beauty, next time I'll take everything, deal? Deal. Lucilla, she... Diana isjust my trainer. I couldn't have won without her, believe me. Shut up, you may or may not be a gladiator, but you've always been the best man for me. Cute! Bravo, Timo! You know, for a moment I was afraid he wouldn't make it. Good luck, big boy. What... Okay... whatever. Subtitling : Vdm
