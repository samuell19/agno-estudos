Shift change in 30 minutes. All-day personnel are required to take full advantage of sleep periods. Coffee break? Yeah. Put it on the table. Thanks. No smoking till I get out, gentlemen. What's that? Pure oxygen bleed? That can't be right. A-com, this is fly director banner. Are you reading an oxygen bleed with scorpio one? Scorpio one, oxygen mix, now pure oxygen. My god. What's the chance of fire? In 100 percent. Fire on board! All personnel, secure... Corridor. No, not yet. Get me the president. Yes, Mr. President. Mr. President, we will find the best man for the job. Thank you, sir. Director parlow, Ms. Gibson is here with the files. Send her in. Sir. Who's available? Stevens is in Taiwan. Owensby is in the military hospital in Frankfurt. Christ! Three months to retire and this falls into my lap. Who else have we've got. Stone, sir. He's in Iraq, but I think he's just tying up some loose ends. Get him. In here. In here. It's all right. It's all right. You're going home, son. You're going home. Let's go, we got company. Come on. Go. Get out of here. Groans. Wait. No. No! With all due respect, director parlow, I am supposed to command a shuttled mission to scorpio one. If there's a chance that anyone is still alive on that space station, I need a rescue team that has space flight experience. I just don't see how your man stone fits into that picture. And with all due respect to you, commander Wilson, there are concerns about events in scorpio one that extend beyond the scope of NASA's interest. And that is where Mr. Stone and his team come in. Team? Yes. Accompanying Mr. Stone will be a team of five army rangers experienced in medevac. And I believe the signature at the bottom will, well, remove your concerns about Mr. Stone on a few days. Would you mind telling me what interest the CIA has in scorpio one? Sorry, commander, but I believe you would agree that there's no need for you to know that at this point. So, in effect, I'm just a space taxi service, a mother dropping off her kids at baseball practice. No. Look, commander, we don't really know what we're gonna find up there and we will need to rely on one another. This is my mission, but I will defer to your judgment whenever I feel it's appropriate. Fair enough. All right. Well, now, gentlemen, if you would excuse me, I must go dress for one of the many retirement dinners that I must attend. Gentlemen, check your helmets, too. Rogers. Rogers, check. Davis. Davis, check. Commander, radio team is good to go. It's gonna hurt much, Ms. Brey. Shannon, Mr. Stone. We're informal here. And it only hurts the first time, right, Carter? Like a roller coaster. You zoom up, then you puke. Thanks. Less chatter, people, you got a mission to fly. It's commander Wilson you got here in the last guy. Don't worry about him. He's been a little touchy ever since Nixon cancelled his Apollo mission back in '72. Apollo 20, I think, it was. Launch control, this is Houston, we are go for launch. Roger, Houston, Atlantis ksc t-20 seconds and counting. T-12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Lock is ready. We have lift off on the shuttle Atlantis. Holy shit. It's my entire life, stone. Houston, Atlantis has cleared the tower. Roger, ksc. We'll take it from here. Beginning all program. Roger, Atlantis. This is Houston, you are go for drop up. Atlantis, you are go for srp separation. Solid rocket booster, hang on. This must be the puke part. Atlantis, Houston, you are go for meco. Meco? Main engine cut off. Congratulations, stone, you're in orbit. Next stop, scorpio one. How long? At our current speed, which is about 17,000 miles per hour, I'd say 10 hours. Let's just hope somebody is home when we get there. Aye aye to that, sir. Today's launch is another example of how this government is wasting taxpayers' money. We're spending millions of dollars to launch a shuttle to save a trillion-dollar space station we never should have built in the first place. Now, folks... That dog don't hunt. Sen. Treadwell... Yes, ma'am. As chairman of the NASA oversight committee, isn't it your job to find ways to help our space program? I plan to help the space program. It needs to go on dying... Kill the sound. Who do we have on sen. Treadwell? Agent green is meeting with the informer tonight. You get Gary as Mr. Cottle. Does the senator suspect anything? Well, according to green, Cottle's been a trusted aide for a decade. Cottle told green that treadwell maybe involved with an arms manufacturer, march ocean laboratories. I know them. They supply weapons to terrorists. And apparently, the senator is diversifying his interests. You know, when I first began working with the agency back in '56, Alan Dulles told me something I'll never forget. He said 90 percent of the world's wars could be avoided with one well-trained assassin and one well-aimed bullet. I miss the old days. Jesus. Green? Green? Is that you? Green? Senator feels you've been talking to strangers too much, Cottle. That's very dangerous. No, I didn't say anything. Well, senator no longer requires your services. Senator thanks you for your support. Let him go. Atlantis to Houston, confirm a visual on scorpio one. Positive, Houston, we have a visual. My god. What could have happened to them? Scorpio one, this is Atlantis. Scorpio one? Any radio contact. Negative, sir. Standby for docking. Cap-com, Atlantis, docking procedure to commence in t-1 minute and counting. Isn't that one of those old Apollo capsules? Used as an emergency escape vehicle. Reliable old workhorse. Aren't there supposed to be two? Yeah, there were. Watch your speed. Got it. Easy. Well done, pilot. Cap-com, Atlantis, docking is complete. We'll prep our boarding party. Next contact in 60 minutes. Captain till, you and your men can remove the helmets. Thanks for the ride. That's an e-ticket. Captain, what next? Wait for orders, corporal baker. Same old army. All right, listen up, people. From this point on, the mission is under the command of Mr. Stone. You're authorized to assist Mr. Stone and the rangers in any way that they see fit, short of ignoring your shipboard duties or endangering the shuttle or the crew. What are your orders, Mr. Stone? Pretty simple, commander. We suit up, go inside and see what we can find. Hutton, I want pressure suites and oxygen ready for possible survivors. Have them standing by in the air lock. Roll it, commander. Carter, weighted boots. Aye aye, sir. And make sure that Mr. Stone's zipper doesn't get stuck. Roger that, sir. Be careful. We don't know who or what we might find in here. I don't feel weightless. Scorpio one is still generating artificial gravity. Battery remote sensor is armed. Give me an oxygen rating, please. Coming right up. I show complete vacuum. Scorpio one has opened to space. Your party, Mr. Stone. Carter, you take the rangers. I want you to cover the control room and the power cell bay. What about the lab? That's mine. You and Wilson go check the crew quarters and the rest of the tubes. Check it. Sure are locked? Yeah, these are m4 laser rifles. You fire on the same principle as a finely directed flashlight beam, but these lights kill. Careful, it's not a squirrel gun. I never liked guns. Well, Mr. Hutton, guns don't kill people, we do. What the hell happened. In here? Looks like fire, then oxygen loss. Tends to kill you pretty quick up here and a lot of damage to the ship. We may still have backup power. It's worth the shot. It still powered up. It's a sad fact to life, my boy. Astronauts may come and go, but NASA technology lives on. The crew. These guys were burned alive. Just like Apollo 1. Hatch is sealed, pure oxygen fire. Must have died in seconds. Poor bastards. I wanna take the left. God. Where did that come from? Power cell bay. Come on. What happened? Well, we found him inside the bag. He didn't check his helmet seal. Maybe. Captain, have your man move the bodies to the empty docking tube. Hutton, get up here. We have a problem with the onboard computer. What is it? I'm showing a critical power loss in our main cells. I just checked them. Atlantis to Houston, we're showing a power loss. Roger, Houston. I think it's a software malfunction. I'm gonna trigger a power surge. Standby. Jesus. Get me back our power, now! Houston, Atlantis? Houston? Atlantis, the problem is on your end. Yeah, no shit. Commander, we've lost our main power cells. Check with Houston. It could be a computer error. Commander, we've lost power. I'm on backup. Well, that's damn convenient. I appreciate you coming on such short notice, director. I have to brief the president in half an hour on this scorpio one mission. I'm afraid we're in the dark, sir. Atlantis has reported a power drain to 21, 24 hours, Houston confirmed, and one of our rangers is dead. Is this a sabotage situation? We're trying to found out. Stone thinks it looks like an accident. Tell me, wilfrid, are your spy boys ever gonna figure out what the hell's going on before another American dies on this thing? They are using every available resource, sir. Well, your resources ain't giving me squat, director. Senator, your car's here. Right, Johnson. There's another matter that I need to discuss with you, sir, before you leave. Your aide, Cottle, as you know, last night, he was found dead. Heart attack. Damn shocking. Cottle was a good man. Just couldn't handle the pressure. Washington's a tough town, and like I told dear Cottle, "if you can't handle the heat, get the hell out of the kitchen." It seems he didn't take your advice. At present, we only have enough backup to power life support and the ship's routine functions, and we lose that in about 24 hours. We're dead. Maybe not. Well, if we flood scorpio one with Atlantis' extra oxygen and then move everyone over there. We tie into their power cells and recharge our own. It's like jumping a car battery. It's never been done. So? So, what if we blow it? You don't even know if the circuits are compatible. But power is power. If I can calculate the amps correctly and don't blow too many fuses, I just have to be careful not to use too much power doing the work, but hutton and I can do it in, what, 12 hours? Absolutely. I have to shut off the heat in there, freeze your tails off. I brought my mittens. Where there any needle box? They didn't need it. Autopsy reported traces of a horse liniment called dmso. Bodybuilders used to use it. When you mix it with cyanide, it's lethal, absorbed through the skin, directly into blood stream, kills in minutes. Symptoms of a heart attack. The senator is getting a little too clever for his own good. Did he need to kill Cottle? Well, maybe he's panicking. Gentlemen, bank statements, the American Liberty foundation. A private pact that contributed a great deal of money to treadwell's campaign war chest and the American Liberty foundation gets its funding from a Cayman island account held by march ocean laboratories. Our friends in the press would call this a smoking gun. Mr. Green, I believe the march ocean laboratories have corporate offices in Los Angeles. I wanna stick a plane out there and break in. Nothing elaborate, you understand? Just play around a little bit on their computer. Excuse me, sir, I would like to go. I'm sure that I can break into their mainframe. This is black ops, my dear, an illegal break in. Are you sure? Come on, sir. I haven't had this much fun since Watergate. Get me status, Carter. Oxygen's at normal. Check. Heat level's normal, sir. Excellent. Scorpio's breathing again. Yeah. Carter to master control, it's like the Bahamas in here and the air is great. Good. You coming? Yeah. Just a second. Know anybody with wire cutters? Big ones. Excuse me, sir. Scorpio's got atmosphere again. Yes! Yeah. That'll buy 'em some time. Hot coffee and cold rations await your presence. Good, thank god. Thank you. Carter told me this crap is leftover k-rations from nam. You were in nam, Rogers, is that true? Yeah, I was in black ops. We ate rice and mud. Me and John Wayne, pilgrim. All right. How's my Violet? Hello, commander, cold, very. Hey, thanks. Thank you. Well done. Here you go. Carter, way to go, buddy. Thank you, sir. How'd it go out there? Making progress. Circuit boards are fried, but I think I can Jerry-rig it, so it'll handle the power transfer from scorpio. But, commander, why would anybody cut our power lines? A clean cut to the south feed lines. Now it had to happen after we reached orbit. A cut like that during the launch would have blown us up on the pad. I can fix it easily enough. I just can't figure out why they do it. I think somebody wants us to stay up here a little longer? We're up here as long as stone wants us to be. Well, maybe our saboteur doesn't know that. I'll find stone, maybe he has some answers. My god. Are you all right? Yeah. I'm all right. What the hell happened to you? It's a long story, tell you about it later. What? Wait. Easy now. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Right here. Right here, come on. All right, go ahead, open it. Can't get in. Sure we can. Just watch me. All right, we'll have the password in 30 seconds. Does that thing also pick safe? Gotcha. Ooh. Ha, ha. Well, look at this. Looks like sen. Treadwell and the boys at march ocean are supplying NASA with astronauts. See if anybody else is on there. Not now. Let's just copy it. Well, hey, isn't that one of the astronauts from Atlantis? Okay, all right, that's it. We got it. Go! Hey. God. Come on, let's get you to a hospital. It's too late. We're blown. Take the disk back to Washington. God. Go! So long, friend. Cross your fingers, I think we're good to go. Copy. Scorpio, we're ready for main cell recharge. Roger, Atlantis, standby. It's gonna be a hell of a blown fuse if your calculations are wrong. Well, if I know Shannon, there isn't a chance of that happening. Status? Hot damn, money in the bank. Scorpio, Atlantis' main's at full charge. Good work, hutton. Hey, listen up, people. Good news, Atlantis is powered up and we are going home. All right. Let's get ready. Let's start moving our gear back to the shuttle. I'm gonna go get some coffee. You need anything? Yeah. Give me a latte with whipped cream. On space station, coming up. And the sprinkle stuff on top, too. So that's what we came here for? This is what scorpio one died for. Whoever controls cold fusion is gonna run the show for a while. Incredible. A handful of this stuff could power up L.A. For over 100 years. What's a few innocent lives when you can control the future, you really think somebody killed all those people just for a lousy computer disk? It killed a ranger yesterday and it tried to kill me and he escaped, too. Somebody wants this disk in a big, big way. We've got a saboteur aboard my space shuttle, stone. What are you gonna do about that? I'm gonna find out who it is and I'm gonna kill him. Coming out of there? I want some coffee. I'm gonna double check a few things first. Stick around, I may need you. Aye aye. You anal-retentive bitch. My pilot tells me somebody actually cut our power feed lines. Somebody on board Atlantis. They figured I've got the disk. Then why don't they just take it? They'll try. Right now, they're just buying time. Beautiful. I got you now. Shit! Sir? What is it, corporal? Is there anything else we need to move aboard Atlantis? This computer. Come here, I want you to take a look at this. You are using us as bait to smoke out the bad guys, my crew as Cannon fodder. You are one cold-hearted bastard, mister. If I wasn't, by now, we'd all be dead. The invasion begins? You got it, soldier. Get him into the airlock. I wanna go home, man. Come on, open the door. Plan b, gentlemen. Stone still has the disk. We've got to persuade him to give it to us. Davis, you go back to the shuttle. Rogers and I, we're gonna grab the weapons and follow him, all right? Hutton. Hutton, come in. Go ahead? Davis is moving. Welcome to the prison ship Atlantis, darling. You son of a bitch, you sabotaged our power lines. Highly-paid son of a bitch. Airlock sealed. Hutton, kill the oxygen, free the scorpio. Sealed off from Atlantis? Commander, we got a problem. Scorpio, this is Atlantis. We've got us a little hostage situation here. We have your pilot, in control of Atlantis. Your advice, captain. Mr. Stone has something that we want. It's till. As you know, we've already cut off the oxygen supply to scorpio. You've got about an hour left. Mr. Stone has a computer disk. If I get it, I'll put your pilot back on board scorpio with an adequate oxygen supply for you and your crew. We'll fly home, you wait for the next shuttle. If I don't, she dies. Within the hour, the rest of you. If you kill her, how are you gonna fly that shuttle, buddy? I think Mr. Hutton will hold our hands. Hutton? Sorry to interrupt your retirement dinner, sir. It's all right. It's all right, my dear. The food was lousy anyway. They were waiting for us, somebody tipped them off. Sen. Treadwell. Yeah. Well, everything appears to be on the disk, enough to take down treadwell and march ocean laboratories, but not enough to save Atlantis. Any word? No. No. I'm afraid stone is our only hope... If he's still alive. Did you find whitley? In the rear airlock, what's left of him, rigged to look like an accident. They're not leaving any witnesses, are they? They can't. Look, they've already killed two army rangers, they took out the entire crew of scorpio one. All they have to do is wait for us to die and they come in and get the disk. They just want us to make it easier for them. Well, we're not gonna do that. Carter... Sir? Get me the telemetry data on our orbit. Aye aye. I wanna know what a five-second long burst would do to our position. Yes, sir. I'm curious. Why? Money, pure and simple. I've been killing for my country for a lot of years. And you know what, I got to be pretty good at it. Thought it was time I should start doing it for myself. Men my age needs to start thinking about retirement. I made friends with a very influential senator. Friends in high places. He made me an offer I couldn't refuse. What about you hutton? Got a lot of unresolved childhood anger. This is my chance to strike and blow for my inner child. Is that what you became an astronaut for? Shut up. Carter? Sir, a five-second burn will knock us out of safe orbit. Orbit deteriorates in two hours. I'm not gonna like this, am I? It means we'll burn up. Standby to engage on my command. Yes, sir. Time's wasting, boys. You got a deal, till. Now you are one smart spaceman. I want stone to put the disk in the docking tube. When I see it, you get your lovely pilot back. Affirmative. Is she listening? She's right here. I haven't touched her... Yet. Hang in there, Shannon. You'd get that Bermuda sunburn yet. Is this some kind of joke, Wilson? Now, Carter. What was that? Scorpio's locked us to the tube. Unlock it. I can't. It's remoted from their control panel. Hang on. 2, 3, 4... What was that? The bitch threw us out of orbit. Fix it. I can't, not when we're attached to scorpio. There's not enough time to calculate a correct burn. How long, Carter? 5.04, sir. Good girl. That Bermuda sunburn? NASA flight school, emergency course direction procedure. We're still locked on, Carter? Like a pitbull, commander. They control the fail-safe from their bridge, prevents disengagement of Atlantis' docking arm fails. We're gonna go get them. That's what they want. That's what I want! Move out! Son of a bitch. Oxygen level is at 50 percent. We have two hours before we run out of oxygen and burn up in the earth's atmosphere. Your call, Mr. Stone. Carter, let's go set up the surprise for our friends. I like this guy. Federal agents, put your hands up. Put it down. Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Nobody move. You're under arrest. Come on, Joe, I'm begging you. FBI, freeze. Get him out of here. Get him out of here. Go on, let's go. Go. Well done, my dear. Send in the cleaning team. I'm going inside. Stay there. No, no. No, senator. No. No. It's all right. It's all right, senator. Listen to me. It was an elaborate plan and not without style. Arbitrarily killing a handful of scientists and destroying a space station just so you could steal cold fusion. You know, when I figured out what you were doing, I decided to let you run with it. I wanted to see if you could carry it off. I even tried to help you. I slowed our internal investigation, set up one of our informants, one of our agents. My god, you were so very, very sloppy. Dmso mixed with cyanide. It's the same thing you used on your unfortunate aide. And as you recall, senator, the poison is absorbed through the skin and then pumped very quickly to the heart. Pump, pump, pump. I think you could call this dramatic irony. No, no, no, no, no, no, senator. You know, I'm getting very close to retirement, and it has occurred to me, this little scheme of yours could use some new blood, someone smart enough to take it to the finish. I'm taking it over. See you in hell, senator. Heart attack. How thoughtful of him. Anti-personnel mine, barbeque a bad guy with no messy fire on board. No mess, no fuss? They're coming. Commander, it's Carter. They're coming. Roger that, Carter. Take this one. Go place that on the rear corridor. Away from me, go. All right. Till, Davis is down, what do I do? Set the charges. I'm coming after stone. If you want something done right, I guess you got to do it yourself. Wilson, come on. It's gonna be all right, Carter. Come on, Carter. Get up here, buddy. Where's the light in this place? Okay. Now help me get up on this. Easy. Come on. You got any good drugs, commander? You damn hippie. I really did it this time, didn't I, commander? Well, I'm afraid so. Boy. Okay, here. Come on, just hold it there. Okay. Give me your arm. It's gonna hurt, is it? It's not gonna hurt at all. This is the feel-good stuff. Yeah. I'm getting all warm and fuzzy. What happened? He got through with the bad guys. They killed whitley. And me, more or less. Well, till and hutton are on board. Where's stone? Ready for till. Okay, tough guy. Come on. Atlantis. Who the hell is flying it? Hutton. Does he know how to fly one of those things? First time for everything. Come on. Come on. It's too close. Shit. He's ripped away part of the heat shield. He'll burn up on reentry. He's got a one-way ticket to hell. He just doesn't know it yet. Yes. Shannon, give me status. Atlantis bled some oxygen to us during the fire fight. Reserves at 25 percent. Reentry begins at 0940 and this ship isn't built for reentry. So that means no matter what, we're gonna burn up in about 30 minutes? Maybe not. What about the other Apollo capsule? We don't even know if it's operational. We don't have a choice. You think you can power up that nt, Carter? If you can fly it, sir. Seems to me, I almost did once. See, but that's the part that kind of bothers us. Shit. What? I forgot. We've got a couple of bombs on board. Where? In the power cell bay. We've got work to do, buddy. Wait! You should raise the capsule. Catch, Carter. I should have known better? Yes, you should. Easy. Got one. Yeah, me too. Come on over here. Hold your light right there. Got it? Hold still. Damn. These bombs cannot be defused. Can we lose these through the airlock? Not without going with them? We don't have any pressure suits. Can you still get in this thing? Watch me. Yes. You start your power-up procedure. Power-up procedure's under way. Pacific tracking reports Atlantis' position for reentry. Set your. Roger. It was on preset, auto reentry code, set. Can you raise them? - No, sir. Atlantis entry blackout phase. All right, check your telemetry, sir. Roger. Telemetry is full function. You're just a kid, how did you ever learn about this old tin can? I was a spaceman in junior high. You guys are my heroes. Don't forget to tie your life support to backup battery, sir. Yeah, got it. Okay, thank you, Carter. They should be. In a blackout by now. Cap-com? No! Pacific tracking reports, burning debris. I think we're there. Let's rock and roll. All right, the bad news is the bombs cannot be disarmed. About four minutes, we're gonna be toast. Can she make it? No pressure suits, heat shield is 20 years old, parachute's probably full of moth holes, but she will fly. All right, we're going. You better hurry up. All right, Carter, come on, let's go. No. There's only oxygen for three. My weight, it'll throw off the telemetry. I'm dead anyway and you guys haven't got a snowball's chance in hell, sir. I don't really give a shit what you think. You're going. Come on. Come on. Don't. He's right. Thanks, darling. Put your ass in here. Stone... Did you get what you came for? Yeah, I got it. Good luck on the other side, buddy. Watch your first step, it's a big one. Well done, Carter. Aye aye, sir. Stand by to fire explosive bolts. Five seconds from my Mark. Standing by. Mark, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, fire. In 3, 2, 1. How long? Fifteen seconds. Any time now, give or take a few seconds. Now what? Reentry, if the heat shield holds up. Otherwise, it's been memorable. Houston, we're picking up an unidentified flying object over the south Atlantic. The shoots are good. Houston, you're not gonna believe this, but it looks like we're gonna have ourselves a good old fashion Apollo splash down. Cap-com, could you repeat that please? We've got an Apollo capsule, 3 chutes open, Navy copters on the way for resave. Command module looks good. Apollo. Floatation collar. Splash down successful. She's still holding up after all these years. The ship is secure, commander. Apollo 20 has landed. Yes. Give me some of that air. God. Holy mother of god. Here he comes. That's a great old car. Yeah. They don't make them like that anymore, do they? Well, I've heard they don't make anything like they used to anymore, even war. You have the disk? You should know that's not secured information anymore. What do you mean? About an hour ago, I put that on the Internet. You see, I think no single government should have that much power. And how long have you known? Ms. Gibson called me this afternoon after she spoke to the Pentagon. I've had my suspicions ever since the senator's aide died. How did treadwell know we were on to him? The mess in L.A. confirmed it. The march ocean people knew we were coming and you were the only one who could have told them. You know, when they built this car, it was supposed to last forever. Nothing last forever, wilfrid. I don't think that I can last for a trial. Appeals, it takes so many years. That way, there'll be no pension for the family, you know. You mean I have a choice? Thanks... For leaving it in my hands.
