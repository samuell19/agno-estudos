Oh? Oh, come on, guys. It's not so scary. Uh-uh! You're not gonna get Scoob and I to go into that creepy lighthouse, and lure that gill-faced ghoul into your trap. No way. Shaggy, are you okay? Sorry, Scoob. Just reliving the moments that led us to acting like live bait for that finny freak. "Will you do it for a Scooby Snack?" Uh-uh. "Will you do it for four Scooby Snacks?" Sure thing, Fred. Why wouldn't we? - I like Scooby Snacks. - Who doesn't? But I tell you what, Scooby-Doo. It's our obsession with those all-natural delicious treats that led us here. Trying to lure a monster from the top of a lighthouse. That's it! We are swearing off Scooby Snacks once and for all. - We are? - That's right. No more Scooby Snacks means no more us being monster bait. We solemnly swear off Scooby Snacks forever. Huh? Scoob. Please tell me you just closed the lighthouse door behind us. Uh-uh. Not me. Don't tell me the Sea Creature isn't, like, up there, but right behind us. Sea Creature! Yikes! We're trapped, Scoob. It's a dead end. Huh? This is no time for fishing, Scoob. No. Sorry, Slimy. Looks like we're the ones that got away. Like, let's get out of here, Scoob. You said it. Yes! Fred, I just don't think they're in there. They have to be. Shaggy and Scooby are the best in the live bait business. All we have to do is have the trap ready when they come out. I think we'll be waiting along time, Fred. Look. Watch where you're going, Scoob. I can't bear to look. Huh? Whoa! Huh? Like, all this fishing is making me hungry. - Right, Scoob? - Yeah. Now, let's see who the Sea Creature really is. The old lighthouse keeper? You mean that old creepy dude in the painting? But he was lost at sea years ago. That's why it can't be him. It's really... Verona Dempsey? Exactly. Her real estate business was falling apart until she accidentally stumbled... Stumbled across an old treasure map and used the legend of the lighthouse monster to scare away any... Blah, blah, blah. Yes, and I would have gotten away... You would have gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for us meddling kids. Got it. Are we done here, Sheriff? Hey, what's the hurry, Shaggy? So hungry. Dude, we were just live bait. - You know that works up our appetites. - Mmm-hmm. How about some Scooby Snacks to tide you over? Mmm-mmm. Sorry, Daph, we're like, off Scooby Snacks, permanently. We need a real, healthy, well-balanced meal. And we need it pronto. - What? - Huh? Buns. You said it, Scooby-Doo. This is more like it. Shaggy? Scooby? Uh, what are you doing? How about 10 burgers a minute? But we're just getting warmed up. These burgers aren't for you. They're for the contest. Oops. Like, sorry, Walt. We'll come back and make more. We'll even join the contest. - Yeah, we're still hungry. - Uh-huh. Um, I'm out. Are you kidding? No way. - No, thanks. - Too rich for my blood. I don't think so. I can't beat those guys. Well, looks like we have a winner. Congratulations, guys. So, Walt, where's the fabulous get-away-from-it-all vacation anyway? Not that the title of World's Greatest Guzzler isn't prize enough. Why, didn't you know, Shaggy? You and all your friends have just won an all-expense-paid trip to fabulous Hollywood. Hollywood? Hit the road then hit the town Let's get lost until we've found This big world This brand-new world Every road a mystery Where we go is the place to be In this big world This brand-new world 'Cause life ain't nothing like a movie screen They're so much more than what they seem All I need in life is friends An open road that never ends In this big world This brand-new world Each new day is not in line So much to see, so much to find In this big world This brand-new world Hollywood, California. Well, gang, here we are. It's all been leading up to this. Our guided tour of Brickton Studios. - It looks so, so... - Old? - Rundown? - Scary. Fabulous. This is a real Hollywood studio. I've never seen anything so glamorous in all of my life. How do I look? Hmm? Hello, welcome to Brickton Studios. Home to the world's scariest monsters. Like, did he say monsters? Movie monsters, Shaggy. The only thing to fear at a movie studio are their sequels. This is where all your favorite classic scary movies were made, Shaggy. Hi, we're the contest winners from Crystal Cove. Here for our free studio tour. Oh, contest winners, huh? Well, congratulations. You sure are lucky. Or maybe not so lucky. What, with all the crazy spook sightings going on around here. Yikes! What? I mean, it's probably nothing. Just silly rumors. Aside from the unholy creature I saw the other night. Go ahead. Pull in and park. The tram tour will start in a few minutes. Welcome to Hollywood. Hollywood. Hey, like, I remember now. Brickton Studios made The Headless Horror movies. And The Marauding Mummy flicks. Scooby and I loved those. Here's your ticket. Leave the keys. Hey, aren't you... Huh? Hmm. Welcome to the world-famous Brickton Studios tram tour. My name is Junior and I will be your tour guide. Please watch your step as you board, and get ready for an amazing trip to one of the greatest movie studios of all time. Hey, aren't you the security guard? And the valet parking guy. I'm something of a detective, you know. Well, yes. Ever since Brickton Studios fell on hard times, I'm also the janitor, night watchman, tour guide, and most importantly, page. - Page? - Like in a book? I've always wanted to read one of those. No, Shaggy. A page is a... A page is a small fry who gets paid to do exactly what I tell him. Not to stand around yakking with yokels. Move it, Junior. Time is money, baby. It's Chet Brickton, the famous film preducer, studio owner and Hollywood mogul. He is a legend. His reputation is the size of a mountain. I guess in Hollywood, they make mountains out of moguls. Right, Scoob? Yeah. Pay attention, kid. I want you to make this an extra special tour for our extra special guests. More important than your contest winners? Yes, definitely more important. As I was saying, this is Mr. Atticus Fink. He will be along for the entertaining, educational and absolutely monster-free ride. What's this about monsters? Who said anything about monsters? No monsters here. Right, Junior? That's right, Mr. Brickton. The monsters are really the ghost of the great character actor... That's enough talking for now, Junior. Let's start the tour. And stick to the script, kid. Yes, sir. Climb aboard, Mr. Fink. Thank you, young man. Hi, I'm Fred. Nice to meet you. Is it? Our first stop is our classic Old West town, where you will enjoy the world-famous Brickton Studios gun show. Excuse me. Hmm. Studio tour guide. You know, Scooby-Doo, that's probably one job you and I could handle. Yeah. Mmm-hmm. No! He got me! - Wow! - Oh, wow. - Wow. - That was impressive. Is he okay? Thank you. You know, Scoob, I don't want that job after all. Me neither. And now, the next attraction on our tour. Sharp-eyed film buffs will surely recognize this famous movie location. The Grimsley Mansion. That's right. The Grimsley Mansion. Birthplace to one of Brickton Studios' most well-known creations, The Grimsley Zombie. Wait a minute, we've been to the Grimsley Mansion. We solved a mystery there. I don't remember any zombie. Do you, Shaggy? Sorry, Velma. We've been to a lot of haunted houses. They tend to run together after a while. I used to love those movies. Especially number three and six. The other ones, they just didn't have enough zombie in them for my taste. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. Personally, I think they're all great. This sound stage is where they shot the long-running hit TV show, without any monsters in it, called Brickmasters. - It's kind of dark in here. - Yeah. Like, can we get some light? Huh? Did anyone else hear that? It sounded like a horse. Junior, is that part of the tour? What's the problem here? Uh, the tram. It won't start. Junior, are you okay? Junior? Sorry, I thought we could use a flashlight. What's that sound? Not listening. No scary sounds. That's it! The tour's over for me. I'm not waiting around for whatever's out there. Mr. Fink, wait. Should we go after him? We should stick together until Junior can get the tram started. Phew. Someone must have turned on the lights. Um, I don't think so. Yikes! Like... You might wanna hurry on that. Come on, come on, come on. Come on. Isn't this exciting? What are you talking about, Daphne? We're being chased by a monster. Yes, a Hollywood monster, in Hollywood. Whoa! Ah! Fred, do something. Junior, there. Get us close to that wagon. Oh, way to go, Fred. Oh... That's it. Junior, make a loop and bring the headless horseman back this way. What are you going to do, Fred? I'm gonna shed some light on the situation. - Great work, Fred. - That scared him off. Speaking of scared off, where did Atticus Fink go? Where do you think I went? To find Chet Brickton's office and complain about this outrageous treatment. That's where. This place is like a maze. I couldn't figure out where I was. But I knew I didn't wanna be anywhere near that thing. I know where his office is, Mr. Fink. Climb aboard. What say we walk instead? We'll walk with you, Mr. Fink. Just to make sure you get there safely. Oh, Shaggy? I'm sorry about the Hollywood get-away-from-it-all vacation. But, gang, it looks like we've got another mystery on our hands. But, Atticus baby, it's the steal of the century. I'm selling Brickton Studios to you at a tenth of its value. Steal is right. You're stealing from me. How do you expect me to develop land that haunted? Good night! Like, what do you mean by sell the studio, Mr. Brickton? Yeah. Look, kids. Sorry to burst your bubble, but Brickton Studios is bust. I'm trying to unload this place before we finish filming the last Brickton movie ever. What? Then you should stop shooting this dumb, mushy, cookie cutter rom-com, and make a great horror movie like you used to. Sorry, Junior. No one cares about horror anymore. No, that's not true! Scary movies make people happy! Wow, he's really passionate about horror movies. He has aright to be angry. Those movies are what built this studio, brick by brick. Here, follow me. I'll show you. Welcome to News of the Earth. Hollywood mogul Chet Brickton does it again with the release of Curse of the Tomb of the Mummy's Shadow. Another hit for Brickton Studios, who brought you Son of Zombie and Nephew of the Headless Rider's Curse. And the star behind this string of hits, none other than Boris Carnac. The man of 999 faces. With the unbeatable monster maker team of Brickton and Carnac, horror lovers should have plenty to scream about. Wow, Boris Carnac. I've heard of him. He had the ability to play any monster. That he did. Ever since Boris passed away, we haven't been able to make one successful movie. - I'm not sure why? - I know why. Vampire! Hey, that's no vampire. That's Drella Diabolique, the greatest late night movie hostess ever. That's 10 points to the kid with the chinstache. He's not as goofy as he looks. But then, how could he be? She is funny. I'm sorry, but who are you? You don't watch Drella Diabolique? She plays old horror movies and intercuts 'em with her doing corny jokes. She has millions of fans. Millions of fans. Millions of fans. Drella, to what do I owe the honor? You heard the sarcasm, right? You're not spreading more of those ridiculous curse rumors again, are you? Curse? Listen, Brickton. I may be funny for a living. But the curse is no joke. Boris Carnac was the best actor that ever lived. Too good, in fact. He played otherworldly creatures so well that when he passed on, his spirit came back to haunt the studio as his most famous creations forever! Gets 'em every time. There's no such thing as a curse. Oh, how do you explain the Horseman? Or the other monsters that have been seen on the lot. - Other monsters? - Huh? Well, I... Why did you install the security cameras everywhere? It's not to catch mice. That's for sure. You're playing with Boris Carnac's legacy, Brickton. You just watch yourself. Was she right, Mr. Brickton? Have you had more monster sightings on the lot? Whoa! And my mom says I watch too much television. I'm gonna show you some footage we recorded over the last several months. You're in luck, Mr. Brickton, because mysteries are our specialty. Maybe we can help. I'll take any help I can get. How about you guys hang out for a few days? See if you can get to the bottom of this so-called haunting. That sounds great, Mr. Brickton. What's that? That's Two Hearts in Paris, the romantic comedy we're filming. Looks like they're getting ready to film a scene. Right now? A film? Do they need an extra? May be someone that would bring pizazz to the screen? Some young, feminine, yet strong personality that would add to the story so much so, that the Academy would do nothing but give her the award for best actress to ever exist in the history of the world. - What? - Junior. Yeah, take these kids over to the Two Hearts in Paris set. Maybe while you're there, you can figure out what's going on around here. Some get-away-from-it-all vacation. It didn't even get us away from monsters or mysteries. Oh, lamp, you're the only one who understands. I love Sebastian and I hate him. But I love him. Oh my, isn't it wonderful? There are no monsters in it at all. In that case, we give it five stars. Yeah. What's this movie about, Junior? Oh, yes, it's the touching yet hilarious story of two opposites who meet in a ridiculous way, and then, after a series of wacky misunderstandings, find they're meant for each other. O-M-G! That sounds like the best movie ever. Sorry. It sounds like every other cookie cutter movie that exists out there. - Yikes. Touchy. - Cookie. Ooh. Scoob? Scooby-Doo? - Food. - Huh? Ahh... Uh... Excuse me, Junior. Um... What's that table? Like, over there? Craft services. It's basically an all-you-can-eat table, reserved only for those working on the movie! Just our luck. Huh? - Did you hear that? - And smelled it. A horse. Who brought a horse onto the soundstage? Oh, wait. Maybe a horse would help this scene. Cut! That's a wrap! Out of my way! That movie just got 10 times better. Outstanding! Yeah! We have to get out of here. Daphne? Where's Daphne? Daphne, what are you doing? - I'm breaking in. - We need to break out. - Where are Scooby and Shaggy? - Where do you think? We have to save the food. Yeah. Save the food. Yikes! I think you might have gotten ahead of yourself. Scooby-Doo, where are you? Over here. I'm through, Brickton! Find yourself another director. That's it. I quit. I'm going back to volcano exploring, where it's safer. No, wait, wait, wait. You can't go anywhere. We're not done filming yet. My set. My movie. I'm finished. There's gotta be something we can do to help. Unless you've got a cast and crew up your sleeves, I'm afraid I've got no choice but to declare bankruptcy and sell this studio at a loss. We cando it. - Do what? - Finish the movie. Velma is smart enough to handle the camera. Yeah, yeah, it just might work. - Fred, you can direct. - Direct? No, I can't direct. Eh, who says you can't? Well, I don't have an artistic point of view or any original ideas. What? Are you kidding? You're a natural, baby. Besides, you're wearing an ascot, aren't you? Well, I never thought about that. Yeah, that's more than most directors have. Of course, you'll need a star. Of course. Someone charismatic. With that special something. It's like you're reading my mind. Someone good-looking. Well, if you say so. - Someone like... - I accept. - Shaggy. - First, I'd like to... What? Shaggy? Me? Gosh, Mr. Brickton, I don't know. Like, that's a lot of pressure. Not to mention the fact that being a celebrity goes against my counter culture principles. But we need you, Shaggy, baby. You got that certain special something. And by that, I mean, you're available right now. Let me handle the negotiations, Mr. Brickton. Shaggy, will you do it for a... Don't say it, Fred. I'll tell you what. I'll do it if you stop offering me Scooby Snacks. Hmm. But won't you get hungry? Shaggy, you'll have all the free craft services you want. Huh? - 'min. - Me too. - What about the female lead? - That's right. What about the female lead? Hmm. She'll have to have grace. She'll have to have presence. Did you know that I was Ms. Crystal Cove, five years running? Which is no easy feat, when your talent demonstration is knocking things over. And lastly, she'll have to have great hair. Oh, I got it. There's only one girl who could possibly fit this bill. Yes? Yes? Drella Diabolique. You rang? Argh. No offense, Mr. Brickton, but Drella doesn't really fit your description. No, but she's here. And she's got a pretty good following on social media, $0, what the hay? Don't worry, Daphne. I'll make sure we get you some screen time. Oh, Fred. You're the best. Well, what are you waiting around for? Let's make a movie. I'm putting myself in your capable paws, honey. I want a whole new look. Hmm. Yeah. Mmm? Ta-da! Huh? Uh... Huh? Oh... Ah, perfect. You're a genius. All right, Drella. Are you ready? Are you kidding, blondie? I've been ready for this my whole life. - Great. - Rolling. Nothing's happening. Fred, you have to say "Action." Oh, right. Okay, everyone. Action! Sitting here in Paris, the city of love, without anyone to share a cup of coffee with. I said, sitting here in Paris, the city of love, without anyone to share a cup of coffee with. Shaggy, that's your cue. Like, right. Excusez-moi, Miss. Do you mind if I share your table? Mind? I'd be offended if you didn't. So, Mister... Eh, what is in a name? It is nothing but a word that our mother writes in our underwear, when we go to camp. No? I can tell. You're deep. - Cut. - Take two. Action. Ow! - Cut. - Take 22. And action! - Cut. - Take 52. Action! Ow! Cut! Let's give it one more try. This time, with a few changes. Okay, everybody. Let's take it from the top. I don't know, Fred. Hanging from this drone isn't very comfortable. Art isn't supposed to be comfortable, Velma. The creative process is raw. It's dangerous. Uh-huh. Take 76. Action. Closer. Closer. It looks like this is the beginning of a beautiful... No, no, no, no, no. Cut! What is all that noise? That, like, wasn't us, Fred. Uh, looks like that's a wrap. Velma, I'm the director, and I'm the only one that gets to say, "That's a wrap." Uh, not that type of wrap. - The mummy kind of wrap. - Huh? Okay, now, that's a wrap. - Like you said it, from head to toe. - Uh-oh. Some leading man. I've got more grit in my toothpaste. Drella, come on, this way. My set. My beautiful set. Uh, Fred, let's not wait around to see what else it tries to tear to pieces. Never, the director always goes down with his film. That's, "The captain always goes down with his ship." Directors never go down with their film, they get, like, 10 more tries. What in blazes is going on here? I'm trying to run a business across the street and... Galloping ghouls! What's that? It's either a ghost dressed up as a mummy, or possibly, a mummy's ghost. Either way, run. Good idea, Scoob. Saving the craft service. Phew. We may have single-handedly saved the whole movie. Without food, a movie can't operate. You said it. But still, this studio is crawling with monsters and ghosts and mummies. This food isn't safe. If only there was, like, someplace we could put this food, where those ghouls couldn't get at it. Like, I like the way you think, Scooby-Doo. We can hide in here. No one would dare to disturb a star's dressing room. Not even the ghost of Boris Carnac. Dressing room? Isn't this just an unused corner of an abandoned soundstage? No, I just have a very large dressing room. Wow. I guess black is the new black. Lesson number one of being a star, always look good in a crisis. Always look good... What are you doing? I am writing your lesson down. It's not every day you get acting advice from a movie star. Have you always dreamed of being a famous movie star? Yes. Ever since we won this trip to Hollywood, three days ago. Are there any more tips you could give me? Acting isn't something you just pick up in a minute. It takes time to perfect one's craft. We have at least an hour before Fred's able to reassemble the set. Oh, that's more than enough time. Oh, Drella, it's hopeless. I can't act. I can't dance. Honey, in my book, that makes you a natural. But what can I offer the entertainment industry? Plenty. When we get a little time, sweetie. I can give you a makeover that'll make you as glamorous as me. No, Fred. It's too dangerous. It'll take a lot more than the ghost of a movie actor dressed like a 2,000-year-old skeleton to stop me. Nothing is going to get in the way of my movie. The Mummy. It's gone. What kind of ghost appears to wreck a set, and then disappears? Look, Fred. The Mummy left the camera untouched. Oh, my sweet, sweet movie. It's okay. Freddie is here to protect you. Hmm. Something smells mighty fishy here. Smells? Who cares how the movie smells, Velma? It's not smell-o-rama. How can you call yourself a cinematographer if you don't even know the basics of film making? I don't call myself a cinematographer. I'm a mystery solver, first, last and always. Now, let's see if we can find some clues as to why a ghost is trying to break into the movies. Excuse me. I'm afraid that I'll have to be arresting you on charges of unlawful eating, don't you know? Huh? Relax, Scoob. It's just me. Check out all these crazy movie costumes. Gad zukes. Like, everybody, into the pool. Space, the final frontier. I'm Batman. Grr. Walk the plank, ye scurvy dog. Hey, who you calling scurvy? Oh, sorry, Scoob. Ha! Huh? Oh... Mmm. Huh? Like, what was that? - A mummy? - It's getting closer, Scoob. It was nice knowing you, buddy. You too, Shaggy. Shaggy, Scooby. What are you guys doing here? Oh, man, are we glad to see you. We thought you were the Mummy. You mean, the ghost of Boris Carnac? No. It's just plain old Junior. Mr. Brickton asked me to find everyone and see how the movie is going. Where is everybody? Scared away by the ghost. I don't get it. You were terrified of a ghost, and stopped to eat all of the craft service food and try on costumes? Yeah, and all these costume changes are making us hungry again. Hey, look there. Footprints. Footprints that lead right up to Chet Brickton's office. Quick, hide. What are they saying? I don't know, because you're whispering at me. That's strange. The last time we saw those two together, Atticus Fink was refusing to buy the lot because it was haunted. A failing studio, the ghost of an actor, amummy, a headless horseman. What does it all mean, Fred? I've been doing a lot of thinking, Velma. It's like I've been walking in a thick fog. But suddenly, seeing that mummy, everything fell into place. I have got the answer. - You do? - Yes. I know exactly how to fix my movie. Whoa! Thank you all for your selfless dedication to my film. I know not every crew would be willing to risk their lives for the sake of art. Like, risk our lives? - What about Drella? - What about Drella? If you think a little thing like annihilation at the hands of a supernatural being is going to keep me from my big break, you've got another thing coming. Okay, everybody, I'm about to save this picture. What it needs is thrills, action, danger. In a romantic comedy? My genius refuses to be pigeonholed into one of your neat little boxes. Bring forth the stunt plane. Junior? Listen, kid, I need you to run an errand for me, pronto. Sorry, guys. Duty calls. Fine, I'll do this film alone if need be. My masterpiece will be fully realized. Okay, Shaggy, the Crocodile King has captured Drella and locked her in that tower. It's up to you to save her. Fred, I don't understand. Are we in New York City or the Louisiana bayou? Oh, hello, logic police. It's a metaphor. A metaphor. A metaphor what? Look, if I just tell you what everything means, then it wouldn't be art. All right, Shaggy. All you have to do is jump into your biplane and pilot it toward this ramp, where you'll make an immediate impossible ascent to the top of that tower, where Drella will grab onto the wing and you'll swerve out of the soundstage and into the open sky. Well, gee, Fred, that sounds like... - Kind of dangerous. - What? Shaggy, come on. You're one of my closest friends. Do you think for one minute I'd put you into any kind of dangerous situation? Well, I guess we are buddies. Of course we are. Roll camera. Rolling. Action. Help! Somebody, help! Fear not, my little crepes-suzette, I shall save you. Lose the French accent, Shag. It's taking me out of it. Don't worry, my love, I'll save you from that mean old Crocodile King. Or whatever it is. Cue stuntman. - Wait, should I cut now? - Ah, we'll fix it in editing. All right, Scoob, all you have to do - is take off in the airplane, - Huh? make an immediate nearly impossible ascent up to Drella and we'll have an artistically satisfying blockbuster on our hands. Excuse me, Freddie, but isn't Scooby-Doo one of your closest friends, too? Yes, that's why I gave him a helmet. Oh. Fair enough. Good luck, dude. - Look! - Scooby-Doo, look out! Hmm? Zombie. Zombie. Oh, no. Not the food. Anything but the food. Oh, no. He's coming! - We have to help him. - Keep shooting, Velma. This is cinematic gold. Gold! Fred, we have to stop that zombie. Don't worry, Daph. That zombie is gonna pay for ruining my shot. One phone call and he'll never work in this town again. Huh? Ah! - Huh? - Oh-oh. Ha-ha! Uh, Fred, can we cut now? No, no, no, no, keep rolling. Keep rolling. This is all free production value. He'll swerve away at the last second. He's a ghost, he's not crazy. Velma, jump. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoo-hoo! Whoa! Phew. Sorry, Velma. I got a little carried away. Are you okay? Mmm-hmm. Mmm. Zoinks! That was too close. I can't imagine anything worse than being run down by a headless horseman. I stand corrected. Huh? Something really seemed to upset that zombie. Or ghost or whatever it was. Yeah. Right when he was about, like, here. Jinkies. What? What is it? Don't look, Fred. No. No, it can't be. The film exposed. Ruined! You were so good. You were so, so good. I couldn't see from the top of the fake building. - What happened? - The Headless Horseman attacked. Oh, no. And a creepy zombie showed up from nowhere. How terrible! And, like, Fred's masterpiece was totally destroyed. Well, I guess it wasn't all bad. Goodbye, my love. Goodbye. Freddie, are you okay? Gang? It's one thing for a ghost to come back and haunt the living, for monsters to threaten and terrorize the innocent, but when they destroy a man's artistic masterpiece, it's time to stop being Hollywood phonies and start being mystery solvers. - Yeah, that's right, Fred. - Let's go. Atticus, baby, have a heart. This is highway robbery. You're just lucky I'm willing to pay anything for that ghost-infested rattrap, Brickton. Now, just sign on the dotted line and all your troubles will be just a memory. Along with your studio. You can't do it, Mr. Brickton. Your studio is a piece of history. It's about to be history, kid. Mr. Brickton knows he doesn't have a choice. Sorry, Junior. He's right. There's nothing I can do. Without that film, there's no chance of getting back in the black. I have to sell the whole place for a song or I won't get anything at all. Oh, well, I guess that's showbiz. - This is so sad. - Yeah. No! No! Ah, lovely. First thing in the morning, I'll hand this over to my lawyers, and Brickton Studios will be leveled by noon. Not so fast, Atticus. That contract gives me 24 hours to say goodbye. Fine. Be sure to say goodbye to the ghost of Boris Carnac. Tell him he's about to be paved over. Well, I guess that's that. Is it? I'm not so sure. I know that look. What is it, Velma? Atticus mentioned Boris Carnac. The studio is supposed to be haunted by him in the guise of the characters he played, right? Like, it sure is. But we saw the Headless Horseman and the Zombie at the same time. That's right. Even a ghost can't be in two places at once. Jeepers. I'm starting to smell something fishy about this haunting. That might be Scoob and me. There was a lot of day-old sushi on that craft service table. Yeah. Mmm-mmm. What'd you have in mind, kid? Every time we tried to shoot, a ghost showed up to sabotage the film. I think this is a case of, "The show must go on.” Right, Fred? Huh? Oh. I don't know. Maybe for some better director. Fred, you are a great director. - Really? - Absolutely. Just not at directing films. Then what am I good at directing, Velma? Traps. Well, if we're gonna trap two ghosts, it's gotta be a pretty tricky trap. I've got something that just might work. If you're still up for that Hollywood makeover. Ready when you are, Deedee. And we're gonna need some live bait. What do you say, fellas? Will you do it for a Scooby Snack? Nuh-uh. No way, no how. Sorry, Daph. Like we told you before, we will not be live bait for Scooby Snacks. But we will do it for a different reason. And what would that be? Because the show must go on. Another perfect morning Under a California sky So let's get down to business No time to sit and wonder why I know it may seem Just like any other town But something happens here when dreamers come around Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood Come on, let's work together We can get through whatever now That sunshine on my shoulder Is all I need to show me how But Tinseltown is more than fame and merchandise Because with you here all my daydreams come to life Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood Everybody, places, please. It's time for some action. What in blue blazes is going on over there? You okay, Scooby old buddy? Can't whistle. Too scared. Too scared to whistle, huh? Well, don't worry. Just a few more shots, and we'll have this movie in the can. How's the shoot going, Fred? Terrible, just terrible. I'm surrounded by amateurs. Back to first positions. Going again. Action. Huh? - No, no, no, no. Cut! - Huh? - What's wrong with that? - Good for me. Was it? Well, that's just great. But you're not the director, I am. Do it again, faster, louder and funnier. - Is that enough? - I think so. Velma can you... No problem. Be sure to get your... I hope you weren't planning on a career in front of the camera, because you've got a perfect face for radio. Yoo-hoo! Hey, Mr. Zombie. Looks like we've got a final scene to film, and you're in it. Ow. Huh? Expecting someone else? Don't give up now. We're finally into the third act. Hmm. You're doing great. But sometimes to get the best performance out of an actor, the director has to give them a little push. Don't lose your head. Huh? Huh? Huh? Whoa! If you know what's good for you, you won't come any closer. If anything happens to me, I promise to come back and haunt you forever. Totally not kidding. Huh? Huh? You won't find me there. And now, I will haunt you forever. You know, for a dead guy, you scream an awful lot like one of my blind dates. And cue Scooby. Bombs away. And cut! I told you I could turn you into a glamorous movie star. Congratulations, Fred. It looks like your directing debut is a wrap. I don't get it. Wow, kids. Great job! I can't believe you actually did it. But who are they? And why did you wait for me to get here to find out? Mr. Brickton, if my time in show business has taught me anything, it's how to do things with flair. You sure there aren't more of them out there? From my security feed, there's at least a mummy runnin' around. I'm sure these are the only two. How can you be sure? Because I know who they are. You do? Whoops. Sorry about that. As I was saying, the Headless Horseman is really... Atticus Fink? I started suspecting something was wrong the minute we got on the tram. Inside the darkened soundstage, Atticus Fink had a panic attack and ran off Just before we were attacked by the Headless Horseman. I noticed when Atticus reappeared that he was blinking an awful lot. Indicative of someone who had just been blinded. Later, my suspicions were confirmed when we were in his office and I noticed his decor. Atticus is an accomplished horseman, and the only one that has a vested interest in making sure Mr. Brickton never gets his movie made. But wait a minute. We saw Atticus at the same time we saw the Mummy. It couldn't be him. We'll circle back to that. Fink, you really are a... Fink! It doesn't matter what you say. You signed the contract. In a few short hours, this studio will be a parking lot. Actually, I have a copy of the contract right here. And pursuant to Article V, "In the case of fraud on the part of the buyer, “all purchases will be null and void." What? Why, you... You meddling kids. Well, at least someone knows their lines. I would have had everything if it wasn't for you and your mangy mutt. Well, Atticus, we'll be seein' you, in about 10 to 15 years. Take 'em away, boys. What about him? Who's Atticus's accomplice? He's not Atticus's accomplice at all. Our zombie here has his own separate motive for haunting the studio. Junior? Oh, he seemed so nice. Why? Mr. Brickton said that the ghosts of the Boris Carnac characters started to appear around six months ago. Right around the time Junior started working here. When a creature did appear, I noticed that he always left the camera standing. Like he wanted to make sure the movie was getting made. The kind of movie he wanted. Junior loves old horror films. He hated the fact that Brickton Studios was now making romantic comedies. She's right. I couldn't stand that Brickton Studios, known for the great Boris Carnac films, was making a boring romantic comedy with her in the lead. Me? What do you have against me? Your late-night movie show airs these amazing monster movies. And you interrupt them just to ridicule them. Oh, sweetie, I love these movies more than anyone. I do what I can to keep 'em alive. Especially the ones with Boris Carnac. Because he... Hey, wait just a minute. You're a dead ringer for Boris. - Yeah, he looks just like him. - He's his spitting image. That's because Junior's full name is Boris Carnac, Jr. He's the son of the man with 999 faces. Uh... I didn't mean any harm. When I first started working here and found my dad's old monster workshop, I decided to try and help Mr. Brickton in the studio by showing him how relevant Dad's old characters still are. Let him go, Officer. Well, I suppose your heart was in the right place, son. But it's too late for Brickton Studios. Without Freddie's film, we're going to declare bankruptcy and lose everything. Play that part again. Look at how scared we were. Is this really the time to be watching that, guys? Why not? This is, like, the best viral video I've ever seen. - Viral video. That's it. - What's it? All the security footage. We can cut it together into a found-footage horror movie. You're right, Freddie. Fans love those fake found-footage things. Well, what are we waiting for? You kids are the greatest. This is Bryan Lakeshore, reporting from the hottest ticket in Tinseltown. The much anticipated premiere of Security Cam Monsters: The Adventure Begins. It looks like the first star has arrived. Miss Diabolique, Miss Diabolique, a moment of your time. With a face like that, you can have two moments, gorgeous. Uh, what can you tell us about this movie? I don't want to spoil it, but it's a throwback film with a new type of attitude. You'll have to pay for a ticket if you wanna know any more. Come on, baby. Look, it's Boris Carnac, Jr. The long-lost son of the original man of 999 faces. Junior, over here. How does it feel to step into your father's footsteps. Oh, it feels great. I feel like I'm finally doing what I was supposed to do in my life. Remember, kids, your dreams can come true, even if your dream is to be a monster. Oh. Look. Arriving in true Hollywood rebel style, the film's director, Fred Jones, with his entourage. Uh, Fred. Word of mouth on this movie is great. Any idea on what your next project will be? Well, Bryan, I've decided to retire from directing. I mean, once you've created the most amazing film ever, it's a little like climbing Everest. So I've decided to focus all my artistic energy on mystery-solving. Oh, well, that's great. And you, Daphne? Horror Heroines magazine says that you give a gut-busting, hilarious performance that might even have an award nomination attached to it. Yeah, Daph. Thinking about hanging up the mystery-solving hat for Hollywood? Never, Freddie. You'd miss detective work too much? I guess. Mostly it's just that the paparazzi constantly taking flash pictures of me is disastrous for my hair. Look, up in the sky. Please sign this, here. Please, please, please. Sorry, gang. No autographs, please. What about for a Scooby Snack? What do you think, Scoob? Are we back on Scooby Snacks? We're live bait, anyway. That's right. Even without Scooby Snacks, we still ended up as live bait, so... One autograph per Scooby Snack, please. Sounds great. Tell me why we gave these things up. Ah, I can't remember. Come on, everybody. The movie is going to start. Wait a minute. Hey, everyone. Gather around. Selfie. Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
