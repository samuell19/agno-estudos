NS 50 has passed an important milestone in Singapore's nation-building journey Grandma, your phone Hello I got activated for open mob What open mob? The Open Mob Exercise in which I have to return to camp Help me dig out my field pack and uniform I'll come back for them later Found it I predict that 2018 will be a fruitful year for our company Boss Based on our market analysis, this'll be the focus for next year Thank you　-Good! There's another thing that I would like to share. My other plan... Alex Can you see me? I'm over here. Talking to you Shit　-Leave it on We are all colleagues and a family over here Alex, let's hear what your Grandma has to say I washed, starched and ironed till it is really hard and stiff It's so hard that it can stand Grandma, what's so stiff it can stand? Temasek Green? Grandma, that's Father's Mine don't require ironing It's wrong? You don't wear this now? They changed it? The Army is so rich They change it and change it... I wore this for 30 years without changing OK, bye I didn't know you're still like a small boy Relying on your Grandma Boss, my open mob just got activated What? You mean you have to go? Yes Alex, this is a 30 million dollar project The entire team has been working over the entire weekend You mean you have the heart to go at this moment? Boss, I have no choice I am one of the key personnel I'm the Platoon Sergeant That's why I need to be there for my men It's the same here You are like the Platoon Sergeant of the entire team How can you leave all of us behind? Right? Alex What Boss means is you should call your unit now See if they can make an exception for you so you don't have to return We really need you now Why don't you just call and try? Come on, we need you, man Boss I really need to go Fine Anyone else here need to report back to camp? No, we're not Singaporeans No reservist Amazing Now all our foreign talents can be fully on standby and reserved for my company Something must be wrong here Every soldier in Singapore has to be called back for open mob exercise every year or two Seriously, I don't mind two years of National Service But the following ten years of ICT and open mob constantly interferes with our life To be honest We are all so helpless I have seen so many men malinger but as a Platoon Sergeant I need to set a good example Not only can I not slack I even need to deal with those who do Sergeant Robert has some family problems He can't leave He told me to help him report Here's his identity card You think this is a collection for NDP tickets? He must come here personally This is by law I told him so How about this? Hello? Robert? I'm in camp now. You speak to Sergeant Hello, Robert Sergeant, listen to me I wanted to come but I really can't make it It is the big day at my temple I need to be here on standby My God needs my body to serve his followers My schedule can be changed but my God's time can't be changed Sergeant, please help I've told Richard to represent me Robert, tell you what I'm very reasonable You tell your God If you don't turn up today you might get charged you might also get thrown into DB (Detention Barracks) But if your God can save you you don't need to come OK? Enjoy your stay. Decide for yourself Bye I have to report to camp. Sorry It seems that a lot of NSmen do not understand the meaning of open mob Everyone takes for granted that Singapore will always remain a safe country A lot of them know the importance of National Service But it’s more important to them to let other fellow Singaporeans handle it Sad to say, there are many malingerers around you trying to downgrade to avoid combat duty For a small country like us our people are our greatest resource There is no one but us to defend Singapore in times of need After 50 years of NS in Singapore we have established our defence system And perhaps, we cannot imagine that those we are so familiar with always sitting right next to you belong to the main fighting force protecting Singapore Who are they? Come, let me show you They are everywhere They could be your colleagues sitting right next to you in the office Or they could be your brother or father Sitting right next to you at the dining table We have approximately a quarter million of them And all are frontline soldiers Ever ready, fit to fight, all the time Stupid SAF Always activate us at the best time So how is the project? Sorry Boss, JMP got the deal What? Didn't we focus on the app? Yes We mentioned they are not just any insurance company right? Yes We also mentioned they offer free enrichment classes for clients right? Yes Then why? I don't know They just preferred JMP's proposal Just like that? Yes And that guy from JMP He's always acting blur and cute His PR skills are super good We underestimated him I heard that he is from your platoon Can you please do something about it? This is not the first time already Aloysius Jin Seah Lan Boss, we need to clinch the next deal Or else your father will let your sisters take over the company OK, I got it Do we have anymore projects launching soon? Yes The one that you're holding right now This one? Yes The budget is big right? No Not a big budget But the budget is... Huge! Really? Now we have energy Let's brainstorm, any ideas? -Brainstorm... ICT begins in the blink of an eye It always come with a weird feeling for all of us Let's look forward to a successful 4th ICT Thank you Gentlemen, the 4th ICT begins Lobang, will we get in trouble for coming here? Don't be a wimp. This is ICT standard operating procedure Canteen breakfast priority. You scared? You can go back first What is this? What? Gave me all coins? Don't you think our canteen should have contactless payment? Then we can just use our card, tap and go Short and sweet You need your card for $2.50? Don't you have $2.50? Brother Everytime I use this debit card I get a 2% rebate Which means I get $2 for every $100 spent You married?　-Yes No wonder So all married men are like this? So calculative You are not married so shut it Anyway, good news guys I'm going to be a father soon Congrats!　-Thanks Did you check if the baby is yours? Just joking Eat Don't say I didn't share with you guys There is this POSB Save As You Earn (SAYE) account that even NSF can sign up for 2% interest Sounds good Hurry and sign up Fatty, why are you so late? Got robbed? I aligned at the front gate And walked all the way in I treat it as my morning exercise 4th ICT and you still have no car? Hello, Baby Where am I? In your heart of course Guys I just went to the toilet and you all disappeared to the canteen Didn't call me Why didn't you call me? Free food Gentlemen I was right You guys are really in the canteen Such outlaws You dare to come? This is illegal Officer will charge you Detention Barracks I am not scared 4th ICT already. I don't care Who the hell cares? Eat Good morning, Sir You don't care? Seriously though Did you go to the doctor? You're so skinny now. Is it cancer? Come on I followed my Kungfu Master's instructions and tips Eat clean, sleep well and exercise more Lastly, my secret is no... Ah... I will shut up Guys, what's going on? What's up? You argued? Aloysius You stole my seat Crazy I thought talking to your baby is more important? Come on, Bro. You know it too Every guy here is the same Don't believe me? Ask Lobang Don't lump us together I have a pretty wife and cute daughter We belong to different worlds. Amitabha Please be on your way Seriously We're back here so soon ICT really is a waste of time All the training and revision is repetitive Guys I.P. Man is absolutely right We were trained during our active days So we know everything inside out upside down If war really comes we'll definitely know what to do Why do we need to revise? Well said In times of war, give me my rifle and I'll know what to do Guys, pretty girls Not pretty at all You're not married yet. Beware of karma Stop laughing They are looking at you Seriously? Shit Ong Called so many times and no one picked up Next time you guys want to come here at least inform me You know Old Cik's patterns He's very annoying I will suffer from it OK, we got it ICT is a short time Don't make it difficult for me OK, everyone fall in. Faster Come guys, sit down, don't play Some married with kids already but still behave like a kid Sit down, don't play Hello everybody! You got fatter Don't laugh, I can still run, OK? Encik Still at the same rank? No progress Just like your hair, no growth Rank doesn't need to be too high As long as I'm high enough to charge you That's enough Need to handle clowns like you every year Who wouldn't suffer a hair loss problem? But the two of you, very good Ideal hairstyle Want to be a copycat? Ask me for copyright first Anyway Don't cut and paste. Same same Sort it out I.P. Man Encik Under shelter need to wear headgear? Encik, it's okay My girlfriend said I'm handsome like this Your girlfriend must be blind then? Take it off I don't want to, Encik What? What are you concealing? Take it off No Don't act like a virgin Take it off Chinese New Year decoration? You better do something about it Encik, don't worry I'll show you magic later You better or else I'll make your whole hair disappear I will "kiwi" your hair Don't let me show you my true colours It has been so long One year already How's everybody? Good? Yes Sir We've got some new postings today They are from different units I want you to welcome them warmly Okay? Alright, first we have CPL Tan Kai Kai Next, we have CPL Chong Junyuan Alright, next We have CPL Chua Yong Wei Tan Keng Long And last but not least We have CPL Oh Chong Eng Alex? Shit, man Bingo, man (2nd Sergeant) (Corporal) Post to other unit? You just got posted from other unit and now you request to post to other unit again? You're making things difficult for me Sir Listen, I am not being choosy As you can see I am the CEO of my group It's ridiculous for a Boss to be listening to the commands of his own staff On top of that how do I follow his instructions and commands during training when he can't follow mine in the office? Sir I hope you can give this a second thought I'm really in a very difficult position What I can do is arrange inter-posting within this company I can post you to other platoon Okay? No, Sir. It's not about being in a different platoon As long as we are in the same company he will surely abuse his power to take revenge on me Although I won't do anything to him but as my Boss he can abuse his power any time he wants I am quite sure he will abuse his power in the company I am quite sure he will abuse his power in the company Sir Please Post him out Alex Also went to see the OC? Waste of time OC is full of talk Nothing will be done Boss how come you have ICT? Bloody hell I purposely defer my ICT I kept deferring Thinking that NS will forget me In the end I still got discovered and they chucked me here You know our company has several projects This is a total waste of time But remember what I've taught you? Think positively Maybe this is a blessing... in disguise Alex, come Boss, the weather's hot Do you want a drink? No, it's okay You sure?　-It's okay Life is so funny You work in my company Now I am in your company What a coincidence So coincidental This is my first In-Camp Training Don't make it too scary for me I'll try my best, Boss Luckily I am a positive person I heard that he's your Boss? Yes I don't like the way he walks You want me to do something? Do what? I can make his ICT become ICU Can you still do that? You crazy? What era are we in? Please 1970s We are kings Now, 2017 The men are kings I have it worse My Boss is my man Tough Alex How come I am the Platoon IC? You sabotage me? No Boss,　this is CSM's idea CSM? I am your CEO, not a three year old kid You wait and see Platoon 2, fall in I give you two minutes. Move it Faster What faster? We are reservists, not recruits What are you yelling for? Have you not been a soldier before? I'm the Platoon IC. This is my job Move it. Come on Boss No use shouting like this no one's listening Still walking You must insult them Just like they are recruits Shout like this My grandmother can walk faster My grandmother can move faster than you Come on, move it Then ask your grandmother to come serve ICT Shout so loud for what? He talk louder than you? We are Armour Armour people talk loudly This is fire power. Tell him I talk loudly because we are Armour This is fire power Move faster Don't make me use vulgar words My vulgar words are very powerful, OK? You like to use vulgar language Hokkien Soldier? I am English-speaking Heard of this before? I think you cannot get that up Alex, what did he say? "I think you cannot get that up" You dare to use vulgarities on me? It's not vulgarity. I'm just joking Come on. Go fall in Lobang I heard that for lessons later we'll have a female instructor Really? A pretty lady I want to sing a "national" song There's a national song for chasing women? Nation. Nushen. Nation. Nushen (Goddess) Platoon 2, watch your front Platoon 2, at attention This is reservist No one will stand at attention The commands have changed? Boss NSmen don't do that anymore We just count This feels really weak This is how we do it OK guys, gather Stand properly, let him count I think all is here All here?　-How many? 30　-30? Boss, you can join them OK guys, come Get closer Sorry, my voice is not very good today Those at the back make sure you can hear Right now, the vehicle shed is still being used So... we still have quite a bit of time Those who need to go to the toilet, go Those who need to eat, eat Make sure you clean up when you've finished Don't sabotage me You rush us, in the end we still have to wait Waste of time I.P. Man, is this your first time in the army? This is the trademark of SAF Wait to rush, rush to wait. Right, Alex? Must follow the RO. No choice Need I say more? Got anything to eat? They are right Rush to wait, wait to rush In the commercial world I will not allow this to happen in our company Do you know why? Because time is money? Yes And money is time Look at all these people wasting time It's a waste of money Why? Hello? Boss, they're looking for you They can't get through to your phone This is an advantage Hello Guys You changed the colour so quickly How did you do it? Magic, Bro Magic? BRAND'S is not... Bro You are here for ICT, not work Why work so hard? Don't disturb me I'm working on a very important investment right now Work is never-ending. Relax Look. Everyone is just eating and drinking Why are you so uptight? Hello My name is Handsome They gave me this name You like coffee? I like this one As the weather is very hot Where did you come from? I was from DB Demolition Battalion? Detention Barrack You know why? Because I walloped the officer that talked too much Very irritating Kept on asking me stupid questions I whacked him till he couldn't remember his own name Share? Look at those two over there The fat one and the tanned one Watch out for them Very smart Look for Alex if you can't find me I get pissed just by looking at them Why don't we give them a blanket party on the last day? Blanket party? I thought that was a myth I heard of it, too What is a blanket party? You've asked the right person They call me the NS database You ask me, I'll tell you Blanket party is... During the 70s there were some hard-to-handle Hokkien soldiers their arrogant attitudes exasperated the corporals and sergeants No matter how they punished or charged them the soldiers didn't seemed to be afraid During the 70s if you see this kind of tattoo "Parable of the prodigal son" or "Green Dragon Emerges" This is not body art This is a sign of the triads Sergeant, are you unhappy? Come on One-on-one Good job No guts Continue playing Although the corporals and sergeants are not gangsters they have no other alternatives but to communicate with this kind of gangster they have to use the triad's way to handle the gangster This is called the gangster's language What they do is a few of them will gang up take a blanket and cover him and whack him hard, give him a good one In the end, he won't know who hit him Please don’t laugh at this "crane beak" During the 70s it was very popular Don't think that it's　just the gangsters who will receive a blanket party sometimes the corporals and sergeants can get it too During those days some corporals and sergeants behave like animals they like to bully the soldiers they treat it as a hobby, a pastime as if it was a school's CCA (Co-curricular activities) Strangely enough, back then there was no such thing as ill treatment they do anything they want they really think that they're the kings But nobody dare to complain because once they found out they will finish you But sometimes Things are not so simple it depends on what kind of soldiers you meet As you can see now the SAF blanket is not only for sleeping it's also for the blanket party I am a sergeant Don't fool with me I know who you are The same practice They will take the blanket, cover him whack him hard, give him a good one and then run away Sometimes in tactical movement This is what they've learned from the sergeant They used it back on the sergeant They have never once failed and no one ever gets caught so this is called Blanket party Guys... I think it shouldn't be called blanket party Then what? I know Since this party has so many people so much action we should call it People's Action Party OK, not funny You all dare to laugh? So loudly? You guys are watching a movie Laughing is not a problem for you Please continue The place we are heading to now is what we call "the vehicle shed" Before we go to the vehicle we have to draw personal and heavy arms first You can't imagine how many equipment and weapons we need to draw The vehicle shed is just like a second home to us It is where the big heavy boys are parked And it is also where we spend most of our time outside of the vehicle other than being outfield Do you have tissues? No Don't mind then Don't mind what? This Lobang Yes, baby What am I doing? Training And... Thinking of you I am thinking of you too Baby, call you later Big Boss coming Is she bigger than me? Her big is different from yours I'll call you later Tell me the difference Guys, the pretty instructor is here This one is really solid Like Mao Shan Wang This is the best Good afternoon, Ma'am Are your men ready? Yes, they are almost done Come on guys, gather Guys, gather Hi Guys As to achieve happiness, prosperity and progress for our Nushen Calm down. Relax Sorry, Ma'am. They are NSmen So can be quite rowdy But they don't mean it It's okay. But why are they singing this national song to me? I know Because this song is specially sang for goddesses Nation. Nushen. Nation. Nushen Right? Thanks for your compliment That is my idea Don't use my backside as your face Don't steal my lines Your line? I saw it on the Internet before You wrote that? OK, so... Are you guys ready for lesson now? Yes, Nushen For male officers, you address him as Sir For me, Ma'am. Understand? Yes, Ma'am I under... stand now I beg your pardon? I.P. Man Don't know how to respect female officer? Relax, I was just joking Okay, okay I under no stand. Happy? Bro, you shouldn't have said that Yeah, shut up, I.P. Man Hello What you just did is sexual harassment And it wasn't funny Because you stole my funny line Ah Ong Listen up I give you a chance Ma'am is here Apologise to her, we let this go If not, we'll charge you Apologise? I did nothing wrong I was only joking. She cannot take jokes? Attention To the left March on the spot Left, right, left, right Guys, got shower gel? Thanks　-I'm back Got fined? How much? Only $100. Small sum I still asked if they have unlimited package for being charged You know why? Because I have nothing but money You know what happened when they heard? Their jaws dropped Till now they can't find them You really said that? Nope, thinking only Crazy I knew you wouldn't say that Shut up Unlimited packages are still troublesome You should apply for GIRO deduction Next time you are charged no need to pay cash You know I'm always joking So why was Alex so serious? When you say things about female officers in front of Alex he has no "face" This shows he has no control over his men Charge you. Sacrifice you To show her that all of us are still under his control To bring back his "face" He has been my staff for many years I know him best Relax Now I know it is all about the "face" Yes, this is the "face" problem In the past, we could be crude and nothing will happen Better be careful now As long as the Female Instructor is there Alex will punish you for his "face" How long are you going to take to wash your face? Hey, it is all thanks to you If you hadn't rub engine oil on my face I won't need to do this maintenance The problem is not with your face Then? You should change your whole head No need I use this to deep cleanse now It'll get rid of all my blackheads Remove all the excess oil on my face Refresh and revitalise my skin My skin will be so smooth and shiny just like Andy Lau It's such a waste You're a medic Don't even need to dismount Why would you need it? It's more worthy for me Lucky I didn't buy. Free stuff, just use Use sparingly Rookie I'm warning you Next time when I'm talking you better learn to keep your mouth shut Do you know that the "nushen" line is my line? You know why I got charged? Why? Because I have no line to impress her That's why she is unhappy So I got charged Sorry Sorry? Just like that? I got charged Newcomer When in Rome, do as the Romans do What do you want me to do? You behaved atrociously and still dare to ask me what I want? Alpha Company, arms clear Arms cleared. Book out Count yourself lucky I am going to book out Your face? Forgot to wash it... Guys... Do you know why I have to charge I.P. Man? Do you want to know? Because of your "face" Grandma, I'm back My precious grandson is back You are early today You said you made chicken soup so I came back earlier Yes There are many other yummy food too Grandma, I will do it myself No worries, no one is taking pictures Sleeping right after you get back? Wake up, I have a feast for you You're already so busy with work With reservist, you're even busier So busy you can't return home and when you're finally back home you just sleep Let me ask you You're so busy How will you find a girlfriend? Grandma, finding a girlfriend can wait You slowly find, I'll slowly age Slowly I'll make my way up there Grandma, don't say that You're not young anymore It's time to get married It's so expensive to get married these days And it's so difficult to find the right one Where to find one? Difficult to find? It's very easy Grandma, how come you didn't tell me we had company? It's inside out Hi I prepared today's dinner specially for you I hope you'll like it Thank you Enjoy your meal I will go watch my Korean drama "Descendants of the Sun" You two look just like them now I like your Grandma She is very honest Actually I am quite popular But I know what I want I want... This is for you Thanks But I wanted the... remote control Are you hot? Honestly speaking I do like you a bit What about you? Me? I like one person You like one person? Who is that? Just... One person I know But who is that person? Just one person Do I know her? Grandma never mentioned it Is that person your colleague? Your classmate? Or your friend? No, no I like... one person I like to be alone Oh... Alone Yes I'm so stupid It's okay By the way Now? Yes There is lipstick on your teeth Mummy, I'm at lessons now I don't want to Can you stop bothering me? I don't want to We'll talk when I am back on Saturday Okay, bye Good morning, Ma'am Your men? Taking their own sweet time like they're on holiday No Ma'am, NSmen is like this You mean you allow this too? No, as in... This is the culture of NSmen They should walk in a group be more organised and disciplined And behave like a soldier You know what looking at this mess makes me feel? What? I am in the "Train to Busan" Why would you say that? I am facing a bunch of zombies Zombie is the right word Anyway, you must understand All these NSmen they work outside They are very tired and stressed That's why when they come to ICT it's the best time for them to take a break from their lives Look at their faces Physically, they are here But actually, they are not So what's your point? My point is... I feel that you should look on the bright side Currently we're at the 4th ICT They may look like zombies, but... they are still young and good-looking zombies By the 7th, 8th or 9th ICT they will decompose into big, fat zombies By that time you will be even more disappointed So enjoy it while it lasts Get your men to fall in Ma'am One last thing For NSmen as long as they follow instructions go through motion and follow the safety regulations I feel we should be more lenient with them Alex Sir Everything OK? -Everything is great Can we start? Start now, let's go.　-Ma'am, let's go OK, come Starting already, let's go Walk Prepare to mount vehicle through ramp Mount Redo What are you doing? Stupid Four-Eyes Don't take your own sweet time Come on, come on Look more like soldiers I know this is reservist But please look more like a soldier Guys, how old are you? Stop playing and act your age Redo Redo Are you okay, Soldier? I am okay, Sir Be careful. Remember safety is our number one priority Safety. I've said it so many times Faster Redo One more time, let's go Vehicle overturn Sorry guys, I cannot hold it in This stinks I.P. Man. Open the door What are you doing? Why do you come out? You have to wait for the ramp to be down to dismount What are you guys doing? Go back. Redo Redo Vehicle overturn Sorry　-What's your problem? This is not a playground PC! PC PC fell down PC Sir Sir, are you okay? Platoon 2 Yes, Sir Always remember safety is... a number one priority Yes, Sir Gentlemen Do not think that you are only NSmen just here to go through the motion Don't take safety for granted I want all commanders to bear this in mind I do not want any more casualty Is that clear? Yes, Sir SGT Ong　-Sir We still have some time. Go back and wait for instructions Yes, Sergeant Alex Don't you think you are too lenient on your men? That's why they are so playful And maybe that's why the accident happened Ma'am like I explained earlier most of the NSmen are like that And it's not just in armour it is the entire SAF And to address your point I am not lenient This is just my way of handling and connecting with the guys You are still new here As you hang around us more you will understand why Okay I will find out more Thank you, Ma'am Can I remind you all of something We have been in the same platoon for more than six years Including our NSF days Can you not allow such a small matter to break the friendship? Our new female instructor, LTA Xinyi is very unhappy with our performance so far And we are the NSmen we are the "old birds" You know how bad this makes us look? Don't make this difficult for me Yes, SGT Ong. I'll improve myself Sorry Guys, food Share Share I heard that PC bought insurance from you Will the claim take long? No We are very efficient Look My colleague is already processing it The claim is quite a lot right? Secret You're so clumsy I think you should get it No need I can't even afford my child's tuition fee How to buy insurance? I heard from people that ICT has market potential, especially for insurance Now I see it with my own eyes You don't need to worry about your child's tuition fee But I really can't afford it Who says you need to pay? Don't need to pay tuition fee? No need Really? I'll settle it for you Really?　-Really Actually, I love coming to ICT Got good resources Good contacts And good friends. Steady Steady Wait Don't be too happy. Check properly first Why are you so nice? For good karma? No We do whatever we can to help people What will you earn then? We earn... Happiness Are you sure? We feel happy helping people I see you are very unhappy Because you've never helped anyone What's so funny? I ask you Is buying insurance expensive? Why? You want to buy too? No, I don't need one My body is like paper Even if I fall... You're not paper. You're bamboo. Confirm break. Better buy Fatty, I think you need to get insurance I bought already Nobody cares about you You better buy for your section Yes, I agree to that The way you drive the vehicle is like driving us to death Not funny Are you trying to scare me to death? I.P. Man Why you keep changing your hair? I want to prove to all my friends that even if I am in ICT I can still have coloured hair I also want to surprise my girlfriend Dude Don't you need to ask if you take someone's stuff? What do you want? You've asked this twice So what do you want? This is the third time Don't piss me off I will make life difficult for you Brother If you want to fight, I am up for it But win or lose you're still on the losing end I don't have any family I can go to DB Can you?

You are not allowed to book out tonight Ma'am I think you don't understand The person I am meeting is a huge client This deal is worth a few million dollars If I miss the meeting my company is going to lose this project Is SAF going to compensate me for my losses? I am so sorry But tomorrow's IPPT is very important I cannot let you book out I can always take the test another time But if I miss this meeting my company is going to be in deep shit Ma'am To me this is a matter of life and death If I let you go you will book in late tonight You will not have enough rest for tomorrow's IPPT test This will be a safety issue Ma'am Why can't you be more flexible like Alex? Don't teach me what to do Mr. Ken Chow This is your 4th ICT You know the game Are you trying your luck here just because I am new and a female officer? No, Ma'am I'm not Just wanted to see if you could compromise Apparently not Anyway, can you please excuse me? If not, I will have to report sick Repeat what you said Nothing... Nothing... I just... Let me remind you If you get caught for malingering you will be charged Don't say I didn't warn you Anything else? Crazy woman She said I cannot book out because I won't have enough sleep In the end, I didn't sleep the whole night If I fail IPPT, it is all her fault You must tell her we are NSmen Our focus is our careers. Not in-camp I've already told her that But she is bloody deaf Women are so troublesome This female PC is different from the fat PC She does everything by the book Just like... who was that Female Police Traffic Officer? No compromising Let me tell you These pretty officers don't like the softcore ones They like hardcore men Not that I'm bragging But only I can handle her You know what I'll do? First I will scold her. Then I'll slap her Then I'll kick her Then I hug her, then I kiss... So that's how you see me? No, Ma'am What I'm trying to say is... I think you are quite pretty Can become Mediacork Star Why did you sign on and brave all these obstacles with us? You got a point But it is the 21st Century Gender Equality Whatever men can do there is nothing we females can't do No There are many things that females can't do Example? For example You all cannot stand up and pee Alex What the hell are you trying to do? Sorry You just got charged for insubordination Why are you doing the same thing by insulting Ma'am again? How many times do you want me to charge you? Alex I was only joking... Whatever, charge me Wow Alex There's no point in charging him Because he is very rich He won't learn anything I have a better plan for you I am sure you will learn something from it I want you to write 2500 lines "I must be respectful to my female superior in the future" Understand? Ma'am Don't mind Don't you find this punishment funny? Yes It is funny That's why you are laughing Or would you like to change it to something not as funny? What is it? Weekend confinement This one's really not funny You guys are funny Ma'am Don't you think the punishment is a little childish? Childish? Yes, it is childish Because you behave like a child You want a mature punishment then behave like a gentleman And a respectable soldier You're really childish I've told you so many times already Sorry, Ma'am Prepare for a run What are you doing? Alex is different now He is not on our side A cup of coffee for your long night ahead Good night!　-Thanks, Bro So bright! How to sleep? Lights off, lights off Guys, why'd you turn off the lights?

Man write 2500 lines He has completed and submitted it to me Good job The purpose of this was actually for him to learn how to respect Female officers But during the process I found out something else You think I'm blind? This is dishonesty, my dear Ma'am This may look like dishonesty to you But please Take a look at the bigger picture When I was in trouble without begging them all my brothers automatically came to help me Sorry, don't mind me saying This is something you might not understand... This is what we call Brotherhood Nice Ma'am Actually, writing lines has nothing to do with combat skills It's the same as polishing shoes and ironing the uniform Nothing to do with winning a war Army realised this and removed these requirements I think... to win a war, the main factor is what kind of weapons we use what tactics we apply and how strong we are Yes, well said Yes I really want to know how strong you are Let me tell you the truth Actually, I didn't want to be your PC as I heard you guys did very badly for the first three ICTs And I don't like NSmen Because you guys are a bunch of old and stubborn uncles Do a little bit of training and already can't take it Keep complaining From first day slack until the last day And still... you think you are smarter than all the trainers here Ma'am, did you just call us Uncles? Do we look old? Not only old But fat also Look at yourselves You still have the face to ask me this stupid question? What are you trying to prove? We are not old! And we are not fat! We are not bad!

Best time to drink some icy cold chrysanthemum tea Relax Why is there chrysanthemum tea in your combat ration?

He is still trying to smoke me No, Ken. Cool down Let me repeat again Come on, guys The vehicle is already so noisy And you guys are arguing over this kind of thing Sometimes we really cannot hear And then we get left, right, centre This is very common, right? So can we stop blaming each other? And in the future, just echo so everybody can hear Okay? Okay? Settled Section dismount Hello? I'm in the middle of training why you always call me? Okay Wait Ok, I'll call you back later Can, sure can CEO Ken Chow Hold on What? Shit What are you doing? Taking cover You call this take cover? I'm hiding behind this tree You, you, you See me later Hey, guys I'm actually quite worried for Ken Chow He's now in PC office. He's sure to get it You took cover behind a small tiny tree You gave the wrong directions You ran around and throwing helmets And you! Dismounting without a helmet What are all these? Treating the training area like a circus? Ma'am In war time, all of us know what to do Now is training. If you nitpick all these it will never end Yes, Ma'am All this wear helmet, put on camou hide behind a small tree These are small things It's all about the motion, not the action That's why it is not important You wouldn't know when is your turn That's why we always take safety precautions Yes, Boss I mean... corporal Safety is one of the top priorities during training Ma'am is just concerned for your well-being I hope you understand Ma'am I hope you don't mind me asking Are you AI trained? Of course I am AI trained Then you should know how hot the vehicle is That's why I took off my helmet We shouldn't be blamed for the vehicle's limitations If the vehicle has air con All of us would've worn helmets till the end It's so hot so we didn't wear the helmets It's so noisy in the vehicle so we couldn't hear the instructions Don't know which direction Whose fault is it? Hello Wei Ming, what do you have to say? Yes, we already know the problems and limitations of this vehicle ST Engineering is already looking at it There'll be a new improved model coming up It's very impressive Really? Of course If you guys are interested You can go to the air show next year to check it out You can also see how ST Engineering products in robotics and cyber security help Singapore and other cities Don't say I didn't tell you The way you lecture us and focus on the small stuff It's just like my mother Nag nonstop I nag nonstop like your Mother because I want all of my sons to be safe Mum I mean Ma'am Ken is not alone In fact, 80%... No, 90%... No! 100% of all the AI never wear helmet inside the vehicle Because it's too hot Don't believe me? You can ask him He never wear He never wear This one confirm never wear No, Ma'am. It's not true A lot of us still wear helmets during training I think in this case, to be fair to those who abided to the rules those who didn't should be punished Alex This is the rule Good Because all of you did not treat the training seriously That's why you have to be punished OK, charge us Yes, just charge No I'm not going to charge you No, no, no 2500 lines We are not your sons Stop treating us like kids Alex Ma'am Go back to the bunk first I'm not going to write What time RO? Very shagged So what happened? I gave her a piece of my mind We went to wash car you went to wash her face? I couldn't take it The crazy woman treat us like recruits She's the childish one still dare to say that we're childish So you got 2500 lines? The four of us got the childish punishment But I represented everyone stood up to the tyrant Plus we are super united Confirm won't write Ah Long, you're in, right? -All in -Nice CEO? All in for you Nice Ken I'll follow you I will not write the lines too! Follow me? Crazy You are the one that sabotaged us Lobang, you know what he did? He told Ma'am everyone didn't wear the helmets in the vehicle Absolute madness Can't believe you This has been a secret for so many years and you had to tell What did you grow up on? Yes, I admit I told PC everyone didn't put on the helmets inside the vehicle But my purpose is if she wants to charge you she'll have to charge everybody Because it is impossible to charge everyone she cannot charge you and you will be safe I actually gave you a vaccination Isn't this an ingenious idea? That is utter bullshit What you did will sabotage the entire platoon Stay away from me Bro Don't be angry Just now, your attitude was not good I'm a bit worried about you Don't worry, I did the right thing Guys, relax You think she's going to charge the entire platoon? This kind of thing never happened in SAF before Come on, we are all NSmen Don't worry Sounds reasonable Got it. Go and bathe Bathe Ms Lee, how is it? Urgent mission. Are you here yet? Boss, I'm here This place is too far I got lost trying to find this place Boss, I'm here Why is there still such a secluded rural area in Singapore? There is even a tank over there Pass it to me quickly What about it? Is it done? Yeah, don't worry Most importantly, are the sentences written correctly? No worries I gathered those with managerial positions and above to complete this You wanted 2500 lines Yes I counted. We gave you 1500 lines more A total of 4000 lines Don't need No worries, you can keep them for next time Nonsense No need Call me if you still need help I'll get the whole company to write for you Even 10,000 lines are not a problem I've already said no need Most importantly are the handwriting the same? I monitored them personally Definitely the same Hi,Alex First time seeing you in uniform So handsome Boss You look cute and chubby in uniform, too You can go now Why don't you two come in uniform to the office next time? Leave now Take care, Boss Boss, in your hand Sorry, sorry Boss You ask Ms Lee to write lines for you? Yes Just like the Army This is the Civil Resource Requisition Exercise I only copied. Nothing wrong Recently I.P. Man got caught for this Why did you commit the same mistake again? That's why I learnt from his mistakes I.P. Man doesn't notice the details That's why all his handwritings were different Look at mine All the handwritings are the same From our company It's not about it being the same or nice This is an offence. You are cheating And you are a CEO That's why I'm smarter Remember the code of conduct We can do whatever we want Just don't get caught What if you get caught? Then you cover me But I am your platoon sergeant You're also my manager Platoon sergeant cum Manager Protecting the Boss It's very natural Don't forget I pay your salary Enough I tell you I officially resign Alex Let me tell you something This is an army camp And you are in my territory From now on, you address me as Platoon Sergeant Ong Time and time again I've given in to you to make your life as easy as possible in the ICT but you keep stepping on my head Make me look bad in front of the guys and the other trainers I will not hesitate to ask OC to charge you or send you to DB Do you understand? Today's our book-out day! Book-out, book-out Today's our book-out day! Book-out, book-out day Sorry, we're going home first Bye-bye Why can the other companies book out first? When can we go home? Where is the bloody COS? When can clear arms? Stop shouting Who's our DO? Our sexy and pretty PC Shit I just realised something That day you said If she want to charge, she cannot charge the whole platoon But if she can punish us there is no need to charge Right... Like how? Like now She'll take her own sweet time Then we don't need to go home Wei Ming Can your company have a new system to clear arms without DO? Can you automatically shut up? Can't you see that we're already frustrated? Yeah, Fatty Can't you feel the tension? I tell you. Don't talk so much You have no car, right? Later I don't send you home Kidding What tension? Relax Let's be positive Things might not be as bad as we think She should just punish the person who made the mistake Why drag all of us in? Who is it?　-I also don't know Why're you staring at me? It's not me Don't mind me saying From what Ah Long said last night The delay could be because of you and your bad attitude towards PC I was very respectful. What's wrong? It is possible I'm thinking Ma'am is trying to punish you in another method What do you mean? She wants to punish you But she don't want to punish you directly So... she punish all... Of us Just to make everyone... hate you, make you feel fat I mean bad Now she achieves what she wants You just got punished See This method is very common in SAF Stop calling me fat, you bamboo stick Stop making things so complicated It is actually very simple This delay is because Aloysius told Ma'am we don't wear helmets in the vehicles So now she is punishing all of us Because of what he said Ken The 2500 lines Have you written them? No, of course not We all agreed Don't write means don't write We're all super united Confirm? Confirm How come you don't know? Don't know what? Come, come United? 　-Yes United 　-Confirm Bro You see?

I wasn't in ICU Ah Mei told me you were in ICU Hello, Alex Finally, I see you What happened to your face? And your lips? Wait a moment Just now, during my training You kept messaging me saying that grandma is in ICU You kept saying ICU, ICU, ICU Did grandma really go to the ICU? She did... Pass by. But she didn't enter The doctor say must observe And I haven't seen you in such a long time I wanted to see you Do you know how anxious I was during training? Grandma, I'm glad you're alright Now, I need to see the doctor I really feel like charging you Alex Don't I look smart like this? Alex Entering a restricted area is a serious offence So many men got injured And we need to answer to their families I understand, Sir My decision was a breach of safety and it put my guys in danger There's no excuse Sir I should have let him go for his family matters before the mission This is partially my fault, too No, Ma'am. It's entirely my decision Sir, I take full responsibility Okay One more thing I am very curious I heard that when everybody was running for their lives during the bee attack Why did you run towards the beehive? Exactly At least Ma'am got her camouflage scarf You went in there almost clean fatigue Are you out of your mind? Committing suicide? Sir To be honest, at that moment I had no idea what to do because we never trained to encounter such a situation before The only thing I could think of was to stop the bees from attacking my men And the only way is to do it was to run towards the beehive And cover it up with a trash bag True armour spirit Swift and decisive Yes You are a true Armour leader But... I still need to go by the book We'll still need to charge you I understand, Sir CSM, please prepare Yes, Sir You all can go Good afternoon, Sir Good afternoon What's the matter? Sir SGT Ong brought us through the shortcut It's not wrong for you all to charge him But he saved everyone with his life I hope you can take note of that Sir You didn't see how big the beehive was And how the bees attacked us But what you also didn't see was How Alex sacrificed himself to protect us That's courage, Sir The spirit of self-sacrifice creates trust If not for this situation I wouldn't realise that SGT Ong Is a true leader with a good heart I think we should reconsider the situation And recognise his efforts Sir, he leaves no man behind It's because of a man like him In times of war I'll trust him with my life and I'll follow him Sir Other than SGT Ong There is one other person that deserves a special mention He saved the lives of myself Balan and CEO He really is very brave Aloysius Thank you You're welcome, Ken After all, we are the force the family and the future Okay, guys I want to take this chance to apologise to all of you For putting you all in danger because of my own selfishness I want you all to know That I appreciate every single one of you And it means the world to me that our friendship is back on track back on the same page And we're back to normal Actually, if you think about it We are just like a swarm of bees Work together as a team We protect each other But the only difference is...

They're my colleagues from camp Him, too? That's great Hi Ma'am Our hands are tired Please carry on Thank you, Ma'am Hi... I thought we said our goodbyes We have strived and survived our 4th ICT together The bee attack has transformed this bunch of selfish sloppy soldiers into the band of brothers we used to be Our Armour spirit has once again proved to us that we are unbreakable As the Force, the Family, the Future As we grow older each year we might not be as physically fit as we were before but that does not hold us back Because what truly makes a soldier a soldier is not just the physical fitness but also our attitude and our mentality We have enjoyed half a century of peace and safety as a nation and that is not by chance We live in an unpredictable world that we have no control over And that's why we cannot take peace for granted Never forget we are the frontline soldiers And Singapore is our homeland that we must protect with our own hands Platoon 2 Move After our ICT we have resumed our civilian identities and we are back at work as for Wei Ming who is both an armour trooper and an engineer at ST Engineering he strongly believes that we will be having much smarter military equipment with stronger fire power and better protection in the future and hopefully, these equipments can be designed and built in such a way that they are self-cleaning and totally maintenance-free so that soldiers like us can concentrate on fighting to win any war And who knows? Maybe one day we can operate from within the vehicle with full protection using unmanned technology to fight for us then we don't even need to wear helmets anymore We can carry out our missions confidently and effectively inside the comfort of our air-conditioned vehicles and unleash the full potential of technologically savvy soldiers and intelligent unmanned machines Till that future becomes reality for the current future, we now have... The Next Generation Armoured Fighting Vehicle Any ideas?　-No You?　-No You?　-No What about you? So? Any taglines yet? No I've got a great one And it's in chinese some more Ready? Drink BRAND'S everyday and not only once in a while It rhymes Who taught you? ICT
