[CELL DOOR SLAMMING] He loves me. Is that why he hit you? Out of love. You don't understand. I've been with him half my life. He was the only one. We had fun together. We really did. [CELL DOOR SLAMMING] I kept thinking I was doing something wrong and I could just get it right, he would stop. Did he? Well... [SIGHS] Afterwards, he'd always... Apologize. And things would be happy... For a while. [BELL RINGING] Weren't you scared he'd hit Lily? Never. Clay has his faults. But he's a good father. He loves her. Just like he loves you? No! He would never hurt her. Never! I should've killed him. [CAR HONKING] BRIANNE: Okay, all right. Here she comes. Whoo! [HORN HONKING] WOMAN: You're late! Cleary sisters are always late! ♪ Holy, Holy, Holy ♪ Thy works shall Praise Thy Name ♪ In earth, and sky, and sea ♪ Holy, holy, holy... You're late. You're late. The Cleary sisters are always late.

Be patient, dad, I've to check out for eligible bachelor. The only eligible bachelor left is Father Porter. [LAUGHING] You should've listened to Da when he told it was a sin to get divorced. LILY: Mommy? Lily. I got it, Brianne. Your thug is here. [CHUCKLES] Don't start. You know he's been havin' a tough time. Nobody's filled in right now. He's been out looking every day. Looking for what? Oh, Brianne, come on, it's Sunday dinner. It's been a long time since we were all together. I'll ask. CLAY: Hi, baby. BRIANNE: You wanna come to dinner tonight, honey? I thought we'd spend some time alone together tonight. Maybe go out. LILY: Mommy? Daddy! Hey, baby. How you doing? Where are we going? Well, you are gonna spend the night with granny. And your mother and I are gonna paint the town red tonight. Can I stay with aunt Margaret instead? She'll bring her home in the morning. I think she should stay at my mother's. I'll see you at the house. [CAR ENGINE REVVING] Smile at your sister's husband. Lay off, Da, he's an accident waiting to happen. I seem to remember saying the same thing about another young man some 20 odd years ago. You were wrong then. And you're wrong now. THOM: Your mother, God rest her, didn't think so. [LILY SCREAMING] Now you be good with granny. She's always good. Spit-spot on the outside, spit-spot on the inside. Right, Lily? Yes, granny. You just listen to what she says, okay? Mom, you'll come and get me first thing in the morning? Real early, we'll have breakfast together, okay, peanut? CLAY: Come on, Brianne! BRIANNE: What's wrong with you? She can stay at your sister's next time, I promise.

[GROANING] Nothing happened. I just wanna dance. Don't do this! [CAR DOOR SLAMMING] [ENGINE STARTS] [REVVING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [GUN CLICKS] [BRIANNE EXHALES] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hey, Modell! Over here. Come here! I got a little unfinished business to take care of with this guy. [MEN LAUGHING] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] [GUNSHOT] [GROANING] MAN: Some body call the cops! [TIRES SCREECHING] [BRIANNE GASPING] [THUD] [MEN SCREAMING INDISTINCTLY] [SCREAMING] CLAY: [YELLING] Shut up! Shut up! [CLAY YELLING INDISTINCTLY] What did you do? [BRIANNE SOBBING] [SIREN WAILING] [YELLING INDISTINCTLY] [GASPING] Shut up! [SCREAMING] Shut up and look at me! Shut up! [SCREAMING] [SIREN WAILING] COP: Stick your hands out the window where I can see it now! Open the door and step outside. Now! Get out the truck slowly. Put your hands out where I can see 'em! Back towards me. All right, look at me! Put your hands on the window. All right, now, come out of the truck. Slowly. Up against the truck. WOMAN: You wont believe what's happened. WOMAN: Clay's been arrested. They say he killed a guy. MARGARET: Was Bree with him? WOMAN: They took her to the hospital. MARGARET: Oh, God. MARGARET: Is she okay? She started hyperventilating or something. Da is going down to get her now. I don't know, let me ask him. No, no, no. The answer is no. Brianne is my daughter and I'll take care of her myself. You stick your nose in too many times as it is now. You wanna do some good? You go find Lily and bring her home to our family. [HANGS UP] Son of a bitch. What? [SIGHS] Clay again? No. My father. He can be such a damn bully sometimes. What happened? Hawkins is finally in jail. If we're lucky, maybe they'll keep him there forever. Oh, Brianne. I was so scared. Come on, girl. Put this on. If you're not going to be eating these sausages, Brianne, I wouldn't mind. Sure, Da. You're not helping his cholesterol any, Brianne. It's only one sausage. Don't be daft, lady, if you're gonna talk about me, at least have the courtesy of talking behind my back. Brianne, darling, why don't you go get some ice cream. Ice cream for breakfast? Sure, why not? Pin for penny, pin for a pound. Did you know this Dale Modell? Seen him around once in a while. That's it. And Clay thought he was flirting with you? It's hard to know what Clay is angry about. You don't get into trouble unless you're with trouble. You know you never understood him. No, you don't understand. Now someone's dead because of it. Why doesn't that seem to bother you? BRIANNE: It bothers me. And what are you gonna do about it? Leave her alone. No! She could've been killed last night. How dare you? And what about Lily? You're living in a house filled with guns. Don't you ever think about what might happen to her? I'm a good mother. [EXHALES SHARPLY] No one's saying you are not a good mother. [PHONE RINGING] Hello. It's him. Hi, Clay, are you okay? COP: Hawkins, let's go. [GROANS] COP: Take it easy. CLAY: You bet. COP: Move it, Hawkins. CLAY: See you later boys. [CELL DOOR UNLOCKS] CLAY: Hey, baby. [CLAY LAUGHING] BRIANNE: Oh! CLAY: Ah, let's get the hell outta here. CLAY: Now, you know don't worry about a thing. Everything's gonna be just fine. I promise. THOMAS: That's a last time I put a bail for you, buddy boy. Thank you, Mr. Cleary. Hey. I did it for Brianne. Now you just have to have faith, Brianne. CLAY: No, come on, baby. You gotta tell the truth. Every detail is important. No. Ugh, please, Clay, I gotta go to the bathroom. Not until you remember it. I don't know what's the matter with you. Usually, you know every little detail. I already told you what I remembered. No, not yet! Please, Clay, I gotta go so bad. [SIGHING] Leave the door open. Don't you remember the way he came on to you? Bastard! He didn't even care that you were married to me. BRIANNE: I didn't tell him right away. I know, but when you did, it didn't slow him down much. He showed you no respect. I could've handled it myself. But you were scared. And that's why we went back. We just wanted to make sure the guy left you alone. That why you bought the guns? That's right. I tried to talk to him. But he threw those cards in my face. Remember? I grabbed one of the guns and dropped the thing on the floor of the pick up truck and I couldn't find it. And you grabbed one of them and you went to put it in the back and you reached in and you tried to take it from there and that's when you accidentally shot him in the face. But I never touch your guns. I hate your guns. You were drunk, Brianne! I... You don't remember! [GLASS SHATTERING] How many times do I have to tell you? How many times do we gotta go through this? What do I gotta do to make you see? We've been through this over, and over, and over, and over again! And I am not gonna go to jail for the rest of my life for this! [GASPING] But... I'm so confused. Honey. You gotta tell the truth. There's no other way. MAN: Mr. Cleary? Hi, I'm Tim Robert. I'm representing your son-in-law. I know who you are. I paid you retainer, didn't I? Who are you? I'm Greg Thorpe, Mr. Cleary, I'm your daughter's lawyer. Bree. What do you need a lawyer for? I'm gonna tell the truth, dad. Bree. Just what might that truth be? It was an accident. It was my fault. I shot Dale Modell. [FOOTSTEPS RECEDING] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] BAILIFF: This Grand Jury is now in session. Place your right hand on the Bible. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? I do. Pull that really hard, right. [GASPING] [BOTH CHUCKLING] How's he doing? Who knows. Your father would never admit something's wrong with him. I'll go get dad. This is gonna be a quiet dinner. We gotta support Brianne, not attack her. You remember that, Margaret. [PHONE RINGING] NORA: I'll get it. What you got there? Is that a mousey? Have you told the little one yet? [RELUCTANTLY] No. Clay thought it'd better to wait. She's gonna hear about it at school. [WOMAN CLEARING THROAT] It's your husband. He wants you to come home. Right away. I just got here. Lord preserve us. For Pete's sake! I'm going out the stairs. Da. [COUGHING] Oh, thank you, darling, thank you. You know what, be a deary and get my medicine, would you, please? Of course. Hey, hello, poppet, come here. How you doing, kiddo? Are you okay, Grand Dad? Oh, I'm fine. Don't you know I've got a host of little people looking after me? Are they looking after me too? They look after all little girls. How about Mommy? Do they look after mommy? Daddy looks after mommy. Even when he's drunk? Go on downstairs, get your coat. Come on. There. Bree, sit down. I wanna ask you something. Will you just answer me one question? I know you didn't kill that boy. But I... I don't... understand why you're lying, Brianne. And I do not understand the control that he has over you. To make you willing to go to jail for him. He's my husband, dad. And he takes care of me. Just like you used to. [SIGHS] [RAPID KNOCKING ON DOOR] I'll get it, Margaret. Mr. Cleary. BRIANNE: I'm sorry, I didn't realize... Lily? You let me down again, Brianne, you let me down. What happened? The grand jury decided for prosecution. They're gonna try Clay. GREG: That's not the worst of it. They're also charging Brianne with first degree murder. Oh! Oh no! [WAILING] [SOBBING] THOMAS: No! No! PRIEST: "The Lord is my Shepherd. I shall not want. "He maketh me lie down in green pastures. "He leadeth me beside the quiet waters. "He restoreth my soul. "He guideth me in the path of righteousness. "Surely goodness and loving-kindness will follow me all the days of my life. "And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever." [SILENT SOBS] NORA: Thank you, father. [KNOCK AT DOOR] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Oh, you're here! Take your coat off. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hi, how are you? Hello. Hi, Father. Hi, Father. How are you? Thank you. Have something to eat before it's all gone. You know Wendy Hawkins' cream cheese, and sardine sandwiches are are going like wildfire. Look at him. He's not fooling me, and nobody is. Oh, for God's sake, Margaret. You act as if you were the devil himself. If you go to heaven and heaven is just everything... [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] [SIGHS] Are you okay? Yeah, I'll be fine. A room full of people at the house and it's so empty without dad. [SIGHS] Oh. Guess we're orphans now. We still have each other. Margaret. Do you think that... Daddy's death is my fault? Oh, no. It wasn't anyone's fault. He had a stroke. It was his time. [SOBBING] I miss him so much! [BRIANNE SOBBING] I don't think I could survive without Clay and Lily. Clay. Oh, why can't you just leave it alone? Oh! Can't you see that I'm doing the best that I can do? God! [SOBBING] NORA: Stop treating her like a child. Some things are better left alone, Margaret. That's what Da would say now. You promised. [CRYING] Now, that was a good move, you see, but... you've left your knight exposed. Oh, daddy, please don't take my horse. If I don't take your horse, honey, you can take my bishop. I promise I won't take your bishop if you don't take my horse. Well, it's not how the game is supposed to be played. Come on. [CLAY GRUNTING] [GROWLING] It's a deal. It's a deal. Hey! You took my bishop, you little liar! [SNIGGERING] Ah! [GRUNTING] All right. Time for bed. But we didn't finish the game yet. Checkmate. Game's over. Hey, that's not fair! Is it, mommy? I don't know the rules, honey. Don't be a sore loser. What did I tell you about that? You're supposed to congratulate the winner. [SARCASTICALLY] Congratulations, daddy. Do like dad says, go on. To bed. Go on. Will you come with me and check for monsters? I already checked, you'll be safe. Are you sure? CLAY: Close the door, behind you, Lily? LILY: Goodnight, mommy. Goodnight. Hey, honey. You want me to rub your shoulders? [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Come on in. Hi. Where's Brianne? Oh, she went shopping a little while. Well, when is she coming back? She didn't say. I called. I told you I was coming and I need to talk to Brianne. You want a beer? No. I keep trying to get her to return your calls, Margaret. But she just doesn't want to. What happened? You two were always so close. Did you have words or something? [MUFFLED CRIES] Is that Lilly? I'd appreciate if you didn't get involved, Margaret. Lily's being punished right now. What did she do? Oh, kids stuff. You know, children still gotta be taught consequences, right? You're just the one to be teacher of that consequences, aren't you, Hawkins? You want me to give Brianne a message? Yeah, tell her to give me a call. I can't promise anything. You know your sister's got a mind of her own. You can't keep her from me forever. [DOOR SLAMS] Sorry, daddy. It's okay. You can come out now, pumpkin. [CROWD CHATTERING] MARGARET: Brianne. All rise. At least she got a woman judge. That's a good sign. I think. Miss. Bogart, you may call your first witness. And while you were... busy, as you put it, uh... "making out with your girlfriend," did there come a time when you noticed the defendant Clay Hawkins? I sure did. He almost knocked us over when he came out the door of the Broken Spoke. Was he alone? No, ma'am. He was with Dale Modell. And what were Mr. Modell, and the defendant doing when you first saw them, Mr. Richter? There were going at each other a little. You mean fighting? Yeah, it wasn't much of a fight. BOGART: And could you also hear what they were saying? RICHTER: Clay wasn't saying much of anything. Modell did most of the talking. ...Brianne, partner. BOGART: When you saw them pushing and shoving, Mr. Richter, What did you do? RICHTER: I laughed. CLAY: Outta my way. RICHTER: He was pretty funny. [CHUCKLES] After Clay Hawkins went home with his wife, what did Mr. Modell do then? Same thing we did almost every night. He and a bunch of us started playing poker on the hood of some car in front of the bar. When the game broke up, Dale asked for a ride home, and I said... Sure thing. And we started walking. And then there is this... blue truck. An old pick up, parked over across the parking lot. And somebody yelled at Dale. I guess it was him. [SNAPPING FINGER] Dale said, "Hold on a minute. I got a little unfinished business with this guy." Dale was standing... right outside the side window, arguing with the guy. BOGART: And what happened next, Mr. Blogert? He reached his hand, and like... they were gonna shake or something, but... Then I saw a flash come out of the window and I heard a loud bang, and... And then Dale started falling. LILY: Faster, daddy, as fast as you can. CLAY: Faster? All right, hold on tight then. Why do you and mommy have to go to court every day? Well, 'cause some people lied and said your mommy and daddy did something bad. Are they gonna send you to go jail? CLAY: Not a chance in he... in heck. [CHUCKLES] Clay, honey, slow down. What would happen to me if they made you go? Well, you'd go to granny's, baby. Do I have to? Do you have to? Do you have to? [CHUCKLES] Do you have to? [LILY SCREAMING] Clay! [LILY SCREAMING] Clay, you're scaring her. [LILY SCREAMING LOUDER] Clay! You're the one who scared her, baby. [RADIO PLAYING] [SIGHING] [LILY SOBBING] Oh, my goodness, peanut, did I forget to check for monsters again? Ooh. Are they here? No. Under the bed? [SQUEALING] Oh, sweety, honey, what's wrong? I love grandma. But I don't wanna live there. I promise I'll be good. You're always good. Don't worry. Daddy will take care of everything and we'll be together just like we are now. What if something does happen? Let me stay with Aunt Margaret. All right? CLAY: Brianne! [SIGHS] I have to go take care of your daddy. Okay? Will you come read me This Little Engine That Could? Again? Again. I think I can. I think I can. BOGART: If the two of you didn't intend to kill Dale Modell, then, why did your husband bring the guns? To scare him, I think. Wouldn't one gun have been enough for that? Dale Modell was a violent man. Clay was just trying to make sure he could protect me. By cold-bloodedly shooting Dale Modell in the face? That's not how it happened. BRIANNE: Clay tried to talk to him. But he just threw the cards in his face. He reached in and knocked the gun out of Clay's hand. And while he was trying to get it... Modell went for the other gun. I got it first and tried to throw it in the back. But he grabbed my arm... and tried to wrestle the gun away from me. It went off. [GUNSHOT] I'm still not sure how it happened. I don't know anything about guns. I hate guns. No further questions. JUDGE: You may step down. [CROWD MUTTERING] [DOOR OPENS] BAILIFF: Be seated. Miss. Foreman, have you reached a verdict? We have, your honor. As to the charge that the defendant, Clay Hawkins, has committed the crime of murder in the first degree, How do you find? FOREMAN: Guilty as charged. [GAVEL BANGING] BAILIFF: As to the charge that the defendant, Brianne Hawkins, has committed the crime of murder in the first degree, How do you find? Guilty as charged. [CROWD GASPING] [GAVEL BANGING] As I'm certain counsel has informed the defendants, a verdict of "guilty" to the charge of murder in the first degree leaves me no discretion in the matter of sentencing. By state law, you are both hereby sentenced... To life in prison. It's regulation. Clay? What do I do now? Brianne. Brianne. We'll appeal. Brianne? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Yeah, yeah, we're back. That one's for the men. PRISON GUARD: Move along, girls. Right there? Guess they wanna shove it in our faces what we can't have. PRISON GUARD: Stand in front of the camera. To the left a bit. [CAMERA CLICKS] Now turn and face the wall. Turn your whole body. Get your hair out of your face. [CAMERA CLICKS] Mouth, nose, ears, underarms. Squat and cup... Spread your toes. Oh, look, such little itty-bitty toes! You know not many people can spread their toes like that. Toilet paper and delouser. Dries up your hair something awful, but at least it kills the cooties. Go on! It's all yours tonight. Ain't nobody gonna be peeking in on you. This way. [SOBBING] WOMAN 1: Oh, shut up, will you? I'm trying to sleep. WOMAN 2: Just think of it as summer camp. Only you don't get to go home for a real long time. [CELL DOOR UNLOCKS] Miss me? [SIGHS] Of course, I do. Hey, did you see us on the news last night? [LAUGHING] Didn't turn out quite the way we planned, did it? I know. I'm sorry, I really screwed up. Please don't be angry. No, no. You stick to your story and everything will be just fine. Clay. I can't stand it in here. And I worry about Lily, and I don't know how long... I was watching you last night. I can see you. [MACHINES RATTLING] Geez. What the hell are you doing? Get down from there, Hawkins. You found something pretty for you to look at? BRIANNE: My husband. He's watching. Sure he is. They all are. At least yours is in a cage. Slow down. What's your hurry? I'm sorry, I'm always late, my daughter's in there. What's your name? Brianne Hawkins. Hmm. Okay. Hold it. [SIGHS] Take it easy. Just turning your tag around. That tag faces the other way, it's solitary. You're gonna be here a long time. You better learn to follow the rules. Can I go now? Go on. Mi Casa su casa. [DOOR OPENS] LILY: Please mommy. Granny yells so much. She just has to get used to having a little peanut around, that's all, honey. LILY: But she won't let me do anything. [SNIFFLING] [GUARD CLEARS THROAT] What is it, honey? Monsters? Do I need to... [KNOCK AT DOOR] Teach you how to... [KNOCK AT DOOR] Scare away the monsters? It wouldn't do any good. The monsters like her. [CHUCKLING] [RAPID KNOCK ON DOOR] [CLEARS THROAT] LILY: Can I stay here with you, mommy? I wouldn't be afraid. I wish I was as brave as you are. It's time to go home, Lily. We have a long ride home. Stop being a baby. I love you. Goodbye, mommy. Bye, Lily. [DOOR CLICKS] We got it. Ha! We're getting our appeal. It's set for next month. Ah, thank you. Don't be too excited. Judge Thaler will be hearing the appeal. Wait a minute, can't we get another judge? She's the one... She's not the problem. I keep telling you the odds are that your sister's gonna spend the rest of her life in prison. [SIGHS] We'll see. Oh, there's one more thing I want you to do for me. What? I want you to file for custody of Lily. And when were you planning on telling me this? I'm telling you now. Does Brianne support this? I don't know, I haven't asked her yet. Yeah, well, she only does what Clay says. He wants Lily with his mother. We have to try. Well I have to tell you there's not much hope for this either. In cases like this, courts tend to give custody to the grandmother. The only person I can see them giving custody of Lily to over Mrs. Wharburton, would be the maternal grandmother and isn't she dead? She has to know. How can you even think about breaking your word? Keeping secrets has only hurt this family. But you promised to Da. We all did. I don't care! Well, I for one, am glad Da is not around to hear this. Think of what he'd say. Do you know what I think he's say? I think he'd say, "Go on, girl, "do whatever you can to get Brianne out of that place." [DOOR SLIDING] Hey. Hi. How you doing, peanut? You haven't called me that in years. [SIGHS] Do you need anything? Socks. I need some socks. Okay. Some shampoo. Whatever you use. Clay says you have such nice hair. Okay, I'll bring it next time. Bree. I wanna talk to you about Lily. Is something wrong? Oh, she's fine. Oh. I want her to come live with Ernie and me. Clay would never allow that. [SIGHS] You know she's not happy with Mrs. Hawkins. She needs to be with her family. She is with her family. I'd be a good mom to her, you know that. You'll never get custody. I can with your consent, Bree. No! [SIGHS] I talked to your lawyer. He said that the maternal grandmother has precedence over the paternal one in child custody issues. Yeah, well, so what? Mom's dead. My mother is dead. Not yours. I'm not your sister, Brianne. I'm your mother. You're my daughter. I was barely 15 when I met your father. He worked in his family's diner. I was crazy in love with him. Da wouldn't hear about us marrying. He said I was too young. That I was ruining my life. The truth is he hated Nick. He'd been in trouble a few times. Just like Clay? No. Not like Clay. He never laid a hand on me. He was kind and gentle and loving. Why didn't he love me? Bree, he never knew about you. Da shipped me off to Ireland to stay with cousin Maureen. And when you were born, I was supposed to give you up for adoption. But the minute I looked at you... I knew I couldn't give you up. Not ever. I begged Da to let me keep you. And he finally agreed, but only if we said you were his and mom's. I had to do what he said. We all did what he said. What do you want me to say? That I forgive you? You want me to fall in your arms and call you "mommy"? You'd never be my mother. And now you're not even my sister anymore. You're nothing. Nothing to me, Margaret. [DOOR UNLOCKS] [CAR APPROACHING] [ENGINE STOPS] [MARGARET SNIFFLING] I, uh, I take it didn't go well. She was, uh... Just... so cold. So, I don't know. What? Hmm? You hide the truth from someone their whole life, what, expect them to give you a big hug? Tell you, you did the right thing? Nobody likes to be lied to, Maggie. Not Brianne... not me. You should've told me sooner, Maggie. [CLICKING TONGUE] [SOBBING] [CAR HORN HONKING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Come on, ladies, let's go! Everybody, come on, let's go! Let's go, girls. Everybody out! Time's up. Move it, move it. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] PRISON GUARD: Hawkins! Are you in there? [SIGHS IN RELIEF] What's going on, girl? You crazy or somethin'? Get up, Hawkins. My ladies don't sit on the ground. I saw your little girl the other day. Cute kid. Lily, her name's Lily. Nice. See that lady over there? She comes in once a week. She's helped a lot of women who've had problems with being separated from their kids. Who says I'm having a problem? Okay, but if you do... I've to ask my husband first. If Mr. Hawkins agrees to let you see the doctor, you let me know. Good luck on your appeal tomorrow. [CLEARS THROAT] Your hair feels like straw. I'm sorry, it's a shampoo they give us. Well, tell them to give you something better. I already have. Clay. Yeah? I don't think Lily's happy with your mother. She could use the discipline, you know. Clay, honey? They have this doctor at the prison. And she talks with the parents in the... [GASPING IN PAIN] I don't want some shrink stranger butting her head into our business. No. No. No strangers. On each of the occasions that I met with Brianne Hawkins, her husband was always there. Any telephone conversations would also include Mr. Hawkins. In fact, after the initial consultation, all the meetings were dominated by Mr. Hawkins. But... She is your client, surely you'd be asking her opinions. GREG: Well... Yes, I did, your honor, but... My recollections of those conversations are that... the responses of Brianne Hawkins were only an acquiescence of what her husband was saying. You're not giving me any new information, Mr. Thorpe. This has all been gone over before. [CROWD MUTTERING] MARGARET: Socks, and um, shampoo. Toothpaste, soap. And uh... I brought you some extra T-shirts too. The warden's very particular about how her ladies look. I think she's gonna start prison fashion magazine. [LAUGHING] Anything else you need? BRIANNE: Could you put some money in my account, I could use a chocolate bar every once in a while. Okay, I'll take care of it next time I come. Thank you. Well, you're sure in a good mood today. Any special reason? [SIGHS] Maybe it's because I realize I don't have to see you if I don't want to. It's a mean thing to say. I'm only trying to help. How? By trying to act like my mother? I am your mother. My mother's dead. I never should've told you. But you had to, didn't you? To get custody of Lily. That's what you really want, isn't it? To get custody of Lily? I thought that's what you'd want. [MOCKINGLY] Oh! Why? Because you were such a great mother? Because you were always so loving, and nurturing and supportive? You were no mother at all. If you had been... I wouldn't be in this mess. I'd be with my daughter instead of you. This is Clay talking. You know what Clay would say? You and Ernie can't have kids and now you wanna steal mine. I'm not trying to steal her, I'm... I'm not trying to replace you. I... I only wanted to take care of her, because I failed you so badly. Guess what. My daughter's not your penance. [MARGARET SIGHS] Hey. Hey. Why don't you take a break? Come on in. I made some dinner. No thanks, I'm not hungry. Actually, I thought you might wanna spend some time with me. Don't do this to me, Ernie. Please, not now. Why is it so hard for you to understand that this... This mission you're on, affects me too? [SIGHS] ERNIE: Maggie? Why are you shutting me out? Why couldn't you at least tell me the truth? I promised Da. No one outside the family was supposed to know. I'm not family? You're not a Cleary. Ha! The Clearys. [SARCASTICALLY] The Clearys. Always the Clearys. You know Nora's not the only one who's never left that house. Your father never let go of any of you. He tried to do what he thought was right. And that justifies everything? Get out! Even from his grave, he's still holding on, Maggie. There's enough blame for everyone! Me, most of all. [EXHALES] So... What are we looking for? Anything that proves I'm Brianne's mother. [SIGHS] Thorpe said he needs documentation. If I'm gonna go for custody of Lily. If "we"... Are gonna go for custody, Maggie. "We." I'm still angry. Don't think I'm not. I'll do this for Lily. Not for you, not for Brianne, But for Lily, okay? [SIGHS] Remember the name of that hospital in Ireland. Pinky? Pingney, Pingney! That's right, how did you know? It's a bill. [LAUGHING] What? Apparently, Brianne had to go back in the hospital. Jaundice. I remember. Well, you look great. Thanks. Well... [LAUGHS] Soft, it's just the way I like it. Margaret got me some new shampoo. How's your appeal going? Okay. You mentioned my name at all? Maybe just a little, I guess. Oh, well, I'll hear about it tomorrow. Oh, you didn't know. Yeah, that sweet lady judge of yours, She, uh... She wants have a little looksie. Not even jail can keep us apart, can it, Bree? [SHARPLY] Can it, Bree? You really think that bitch of a sister, or mother, whatever the hell she is, can get you out? You belong to me, I can get you any time I want. In here, or dead. It's your choice. You can't do anything worse to me than I already almost did to myself. You're a liar. You don't got the guts to kill yourself. The only thing that stopped me was thinking about Lily. [SNAPPING FINGER] Speaking of which... I wonder how Lily's enjoying my old bed. I know my mom said that she was doing real well. Nice and healthy. Let's just hope she stays that way. You wouldn't hurt Lily. Oh, [SCOFFS] I wouldn't be the one hurting Lily. You'd be the one hurting Lily. You know they won't let him near you. You don't know my husband. You don't know me. Good morning, Bree. Mr. Thorpe. [DOOR OPENS] [CHUCKLES] MAN: Let's go. [BUZZER SOUNDING] Time's up, ladies, back to the salt lines. Hey, Dan. Right now, even you'd look good in an outfit like that. Come on, move it, let's go. Come on, let's go. Come on, Brianne, let's go. Did you hear me? I said let's go, now. Come on! I got three more minutes. It's more like two minutes and 15 seconds. Don't make a habit of this, Hawkins. JUDGE THALER: And so the case before presents an assertion of a serious threat to the process of justice. The coercion of one witness to give false testimony in order to free another. When the two parties involved are husband and wife, then that assertion must be given even more weight. However, in this particular case, the assertion is simply not supported by facts. None of the so-called new evidence presented at the hearing is either strong enough, or new enough to have the potential to change the verdict. The petition for post conviction relief is denied. Court adjourned. [BRIANNE HUMMING] [LILY SNIFFLING] Don't go, mommy! [SIGHS WEARILY] I have to, Peanut. Oh... Stop crying. You'll ruin your dress. How many times have I told you? Spit-spot on the outside, spit-spot on the inside. I'm sorry. This isn't about you. I've decided to support your petition for custody. I hope you can be a better mother to her than you were to me. I'm beginning to think you don't love me anymore. I wanna talk about Lily. I don't. Please, Clay. You and me, we made a mess of our lives. Can't we do better for her? Drop it! I can't. [EXHALES] I know you want her to be with your mother, but... Lily's miserable. We're gonna be in here for the rest of our lives. She needs someone that she can... Margaret. She's Lily's grandma, too. I'll tell you what. When I see her this afternoon... I'm gonna tell my mother to file for full custody. I think that makes the most sense. No. Pardon me? [FIRMLY] No. Get off her, Hawkins! Let go of her. Pull it off! Get off! Cuff him! Get him down here! Easy! [MACHINES RATTLING] Ernie? Hey. [GASPING] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where's the prison break? Oh, please Mr. Danforth. I have to use the phone. After 3:00. You know the rules. It's really important. No way. You know what could happen if somebody were to catch you. [WHISPERING] Don't argue with me, Margaret. You've gotta do it now. Visitation starts in two hours. If he gets to his mom before you get to Lily... I don't... Your machine's fixed. [YELLING] Do it now! [MAN OVER PA] Attention, attention. Visiting hours commences in ten minutes. Visiting hour will commence in ten minutes. Must have already gone in. MARGARET: For once in my life, I'm early. The lines aren't moving. No one's gone in yet. Nothing you do ever turns out right. What are you talking about? I'm talking about two grown women outside a prison waiting to kidnap a little girl. You don't have to be here if you don't want to. Somebody's gotta see you don't get arrested. My whole life, I spent taking care of this family. First Da, and now the rest of you. It was your choice. Well if you listened to him, none of this would've happened. You never listen to anyone, and so you ended up pregnant. Oh please! I'm tired of being the whipping boy for this family. "None of this would have happened if Margaret hadn't gotten knocked up." "None of this would've happened if mom hadn't died." "None of this would've happened if moon were made of cheese." There she is! Now, what do we do? [EXHALES] Uh... Slide over. Get ready to drive like a bat out of hell. Come on, baby. Over here. [CAR DOOR OPENS] It's hopeless. [CAR HORN HONKING] Stop fidgeting. You'll meet your daddy in a minute. Come on, baby. Come on, baby! Now what is it? Granny, your slip is showing. Grandma... Spit-spot on the outside, spit-spot on the inside. Run, baby. That's my girl. [ENGINE STARTS, REVVING] Hurry up, hurry up, hurry! Hey! Lily! Lily! Tell your mother that we have rules here. If she wants you to know your daughter's with her, she'll have to wait till you're out of the hole like everyone else. [LILY READING] "Up, up, up "Faster and faster And faster and faster "The little engine climbed. "until it lastly reached The top of the mountain. "'Hurray! Hurray!' Cried the funny little clown "and..." The judge agreed. Children need discipline. She'll spoil you rotten. [EXCLAIMS HAPPILY] [EXCLAIMS] Do you have enough money left to pay the lawyer to get my mom out of jail? Hey, I'll tell you a secret. If your mom doesn't get a new appeal, then grandma here is gonna bust her out of jail. [CHUCKLING] BRIANNE: You don't know what it's like. I couldn't breathe. I would have done anything to get away from him. Is that why you married Clay? To get away from your father? He loves me. Is that why he hit you? Out of love? You don't understand. You're a liar! [SCREAMING] It was our anniversary. Yeah? You think I didn't see the way you looked at him? [WHIMPERING] You think I didn't see? You think I'm blind? Please, Clay! BRIANNE: I kept thinking I was doing something wrong. And if I could just get it right, he'd stop. Did he? Well, afterwards, he'd always... Apologize. And things would be happy. [CRYING] CLAY: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Bree. Don't you understand? I have never loved somebody so much in my whole life. You forgive me, don't you? Baby? Bree? Why are you doing this? [BRIANNE CRYING] I love you so much, and you're killing me. No. Why don't you just do it? Why don't you just get it over with? Kill me. Come on! No, stop it, Clay, just stop it. Come on! Aah! Did Lily ever see him hit you? BRIANNE: Yes. Weren't you scared he'd hit Lily? Never. Clay has his faults. But he's a good father. He loves her. Just like he loves you? No! He'd never hurt her. Never! Don't look at daddy, okay? Come back here, Brianne! I ain't through talking with you yet. Just going to the store, we're outta milk. We'll be right back. Bree! I don't want you to go. Fifteen minutes, Clay. I promise. Yeah? ERNIE: [SOFTLY] Maggie. It's getting late. Come back to bed. Again, Ernie? LILY: Grandma? Hi, honey! Uh, you're supposed to knock, Lily. Sorry, Grandpa. It's okay. ERNIE: Hey. What have you got there? It's one of the little people Grand Da gave me. He protects me. Your own personal Leprechaun! It's really a piggy-bank. It's for mommy's lawyer. Oh, sweety. Thank you, Lily. Come here, pumpkin. Upsy-daisy. And I wanna talk to the judge. You do? Everybody else gets to talk to the judge. Are you sure? Sweetie. If you talk to her, she's gonna ask you lots of questions about mommy and daddy. Things that might be scary to talk about. You sure you wanna do that? Will daddy be mad at me? Well, if you tell the truth, I think you're daddy will be really proud of you. Ernie... Come on, we have to be honest too. No one knows how your daddy will feel about it, sweetie. LILY: If I talk to the judge, will it help mommy get a new trial? It might. I want mommy to come home. JUDGE: Are you sure you saw your dad hit your mom? He didn't think I saw. But I did. Where did he hit her? Mostly on her head and neck. She used to cover-up her boo-boos with make-up. Did your dad hit you also? He had this belt that he made. Did you tell your mom when he hit you? You have to say the words Lily, otherwise the lady can't write 'em down. Okay. No, I never told my mom. Why not? Sorry, daddy. Because... daddy said... that if I told... he would know. I was scared. Did you ever tell anyone else? A friend, a teacher at school, someone else in your family? No. Nobody. Why not? Because I thought it was normal. Do you know your mother said at her trial that she shot the gun that killed Dale Modell? She couldn't! She hates guns. My daddy has a lot of them. But she wont even go near them. Why would your mom say it if it isn't the truth? [GLASS SHATTERING] [GASPING] Maybe because she was afraid and did whatever he told her to. She was just like me. GREG: That oughta be enough to get a new trial. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Uh, finished. Not yet, Hawkins. Come here! What? You gotta be kidding. Do as I tell you. I'll be in to get you real soon. [DOOR SLAMS] PRISON GUARD: Hawkins, get your butt out here. There's more work to be done! Listen, Danforth! You can put me in solitary for the rest of my life, but I am really... ♪ For she's a jolly good fellow ♪ For she's a jolly good fellow ♪ For she' wants A jolly good pardon ♪ Which nobody can deny ♪ [APPLAUDING] I forgot. Hopefully not all in here. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I mean it. This is a really happy birthday for me. Make a wish. GREG: And who were your husband's fits of rage normally directed at? BRIANNE: Usually me. Almost always me. But on the night of the murder, they weren't directed at you, were they, Mrs. Hawkins? No. And who were they directed at? Dale Modell. And were you afraid of what your husband might do? Yes. If that's true, Mrs. Hawkins, and remembering that we're talking about a man with two loaded guns in the car, why didn't you at least try to phone the police, or try to get help? Why did you go back to the Broken Spoke? I had to. I thought it was the only way I could stop him... Like I had in the past. Or at least direct his rage at you. [SIGHS] Or direct his rage at me. Come on, honey, let's go home. They could be playing cards all night. Be quiet. They're breaking up now. Hey, Modell. Over here. Clay, it was all my fault. I should've... I should've told him to leave me alone. Treated me like dirt! You come back to see me, sugar? No, just go away. Are you sure? You don't know what you're missing. I think you owe me an apology. And if I don't? If you don't? How tough are you? BRIANNE: No. Little boys shouldn't play with guns, Hawkins. You're damn right, they shouldn't. BRIANNE: No, Clay, can you stop it. Don't! No, Clay, stop! [SCUFFLING] Stop it! No! Clay! [GUNSHOT] [GASPING] So all your testimony to the grand jury was a lie? Is that what you're telling us now, Mrs. Hawkins? Yes. And I'm... [DOOR OPENS] [CROWD MUTTERING] [GAVEL BANGING] GREG: Your honor, might we approach the bench? How could they do this to her? She'll handle it. GREG: Your honor, I don't think he should be here. BOGART: Your honor, defense counsel is stalling. Your honor we've objected to this before. BOGART: We've argued about it before. Go ahead. Thank you. JUDGE: You may proceed, Miss Bogart. And the reason you lied to the grand jury was not because you were afraid of going to jail for the murder of Dale Modell, it was because your... husband... brainwashed you into saying the shooting was an accident, is that right? Yes. So, what you're telling us now is that... everything was your husband's fault. He wanted to kill Dale Modell, he pulled the trigger, he thought up the lies, he masterminded the whole enchilada. And you... you were the innocent victim. No. It was my fault too. I was too scared to stand up to him. But you're not so scared anymore, are you, Mrs. Hawkins? No. BOGART: The fact is... You're brave enough to do whatever it takes to get out of prison, aren't you? Do anything, say anything... make up a whole new set of lies. Isn't that right, Mrs. Hawkins? Objection! Counsel is doing nothing but badgering the witness. Sustained. You don't have to answer that. Yes, I do. If I had to make myself believe one more lie, or do one more thing I didn't know was right... even to keep from spending the rest of my life in jail, you could leave the gates wide open. Leave that prison empty, and I would never take one step... outside. LILY: And grandma and I ride our bikes everyday. Almost every day. And grandpa helps me with my homework. He hardly ever yells. And grandma says I can get this cat, Elliott. But the problem is, I think that grandpa Ernie is scared of cats. Isn't that silly? [CHUCKLES] That's very silly. Honey, why don't go show Dan your new bracelet? Go on. Okay, be right back. MARGARET: Hey. Penny for your thoughts. I was thinking about Da. Hmm. You think he'd be proud of me? Da was always proud of you. You were his little girl. And then I was Clay's. I always had someone to take care of me. At least that's what I thought they were doing. I keep thinking that if I'd told you sooner, that if you had a mother to come to, that you wouldn't be here. I think being here saved my life. Without prison, sooner or later... Clay would've killed me, or Lily. I came into this big scary place and I survived. Now I know I can survive anything. All on your own. You're late. No, you don't. That's my daughter in there. JUDGE: The issue of married woman syndrome is raised as a defense in a criminal trial. We hold that the burden of proof is not on the State to disprove it, but rather on the defendant, to prove the existence of the condition by preponderance of the evidence. In this case, the evidence clearly shows that Clay Hawkins' domination, enforced by vicious pattern of physical and mental abuse, prevented Brianne Hawkins from assisting her attorney in presenting an adequate and truthful defense. The petitioner, in this case, has sustained her burden of proof. Case reversed, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. [GAVEL BANGING] [CROWD APPLAUDING] What happened? I think we can cancel prison break. [GAVEL BANGING] [CROWD CONTINUE APPLAUDING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] LILY: Mommy, mommy! Honey! Hey, mom. Hi, Peanut! [CROWD APPLAUDING]
