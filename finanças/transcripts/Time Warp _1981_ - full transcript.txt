- This is central control. We have five minutes to go. It looks like a good day for pickup. Yes, all systems are on go, manual is all set. We have a radio contact that's come in and says that we have a pickup at. We'll be starting our countdown before long. This is central control, we have about a little more, a little more than four minutes to go. So do you hear me? I want you to run a systems check if you can over on the quaters and check with me when you get it fixed. I want to know all systems. I want, we'll have that weather report in a few minutes. - This way please. In less than four minutes, ladies and gentlemen, NASA officials will be making their first radio and video contact with the United States spacecraft, Solo One, which is now on its return flight after conducting experimental mission into the farthest reaches of our galaxy. - And no one has spoken with or seen him for a year, right? - That's correct. Now gentlemen, if you will step here behind the rope. That's very good, all cameras and cameramen on that side. - Protective shield ready. - This is actually the farthest reach of the galaxy. - This is the first time at this is ever-- - Yeah. - Well who is this? - That's Cardinal Rule, that's R-U-L-E. And he is the consulting theologian and psychologist of the Air Force. - Oh. - Excuse me, I just want to see. - Oh. - I'll be you in just a moment. - Great. - Oh, sir, very nice to see you. - Lieutenant Hawkins? - Yes indeed. Right here. So glad you were able to. Thank you. - Thank you. - I'll be with you in just a moment. - Thank you very much. - Yes, now what he is showing you are the-- - Protective shield folding. - What is this, the rainy season? - All right, we're ready for an interface with Solo One, and it looks like weather is fine. - Westin-- - That is Colonel Westin. W-E-S-T-I-N. He's the officer in charge of the mission. - Okay. - He got this mission off the ground when everyone else was against it. - Right, right. - Sir, we should be in contact in 3 1/2 minutes. - I'll tell you something off the record. He sent his very best friend on this dangerous mission because he didn't want to be a hero himself. - Okay. - Oh, certainly. Colonel, this is Tina Hawkins of the Tribune. She'd like very much to talk to you and ask you some questions about your-- - How do you do? - Ellen Devore, Ellen, I'm so happy to see you. How long has it been? - You just saw us two hours ago at the Burger King. - Say hello, Ron. - Hello. - Ed, when will we be making contact? - Contact? - With the ship? - Oh, the ship. Very soon, about 1400 hours. - That's two o'clock, mom. - You're a smart little boy, Ron. Why don't you go ask Mitch to buy you a lolly pop. I wanna talk to your mother alone. - No. - No what? - No, I don't wanna lolly pop. I've outgrown lolly pops. - Colonel Westin, we're ready for your interview, sir. Sir. - Two years ago, May 13, 1983, high powered radio scopes picked up unusual flickers from a point in space where no star was known to exist. Our instrumentation was able to determine that the shape was round with the dimensions of about eight football fields laid side by side. After assimilating all known data, we determined it was a black hole, the only one to ever have been sighted in our own galaxy. The instrumentation showed a rotation to this form, which fit into my theory. I personally was overwhelmed by the vast opportunities this presented for study. ♪ And the skies are not cloudy all day ♪ The Solo One had been in readiness for just such a mission. About a week before the Solo One's launch, the black hole seemed to disappear from our monitorings. I concluded that this was due to the constant movement of interstellar matter which blocked it from our monitoring systems, therefore, I urged the launch to take place. The mission of the Solo One was to fly to the site of this phenomenon, monitor it for rotation and orbital movement, measure gravitational pull. On board the Solo One is the most highly advanced computer ever to have been assembled by me, by man, the Wes-10. It is the Wes-10's prime function and responsibility to unlock the mysteries of space, to carry out the duties of this mission. - Two minutes to contact. - Colonel, colonel, would you give us more information on phase two of the mission prior to contact? And something about the astronaut? - On board the Solo One is astronaut Mark Devore. For details on that phase of the mission, I now turn the proceedings over to our consulting theologian and psychologist, Cardinal Rule. - I never knew Captain Devore personally, but from-- I never knew Captain Devore personally, but from speaking with those who knew him, I mean who know him, I find him to be much a beloved man. Beloved by his wife, Ellen, beloved by his son, Ron. - One minute to contact. - Speed it up and spit it out, Rule. - Phase two of the mission is to study a black hole's effect on a human being, psychologically, physically, and of course, spiritually. - 40 seconds. - Yeah, but there's more, you see, and this is the most important part. Oh well. This has been man's first solo space voyage of this length. Its outcome will have great bearings on future flights by man into the outer reaches of the universe. How does he hold up psychologically being alone in the void with just a machine as his sole companion? - Just a machine, Cardinal? - What happens to his psyche when he is confronted by the vast unknown? - That doesn't work, that doesn't have the work. That's okay. - Extensive psychological tests will be carried out on Captain Devore upon his return. No human being has spoken to Captain Devore for a full year. He has had no contact with any living creature. This first communication will tell all. We must hope for the best, and be strong enough to accept the worst. - Now just a minute please, Cardinal, the Wes-10 is not just a computer. I created him to be the perfect companion to man, present company excluded. The Wes-10 was created in my image. - Solo One now entering communication range. Beginning countdown to radio and picture relay. Zero minus 30 seconds and counting. - And counting. ♪ And the skies are not cloudy all day ♪ ♪ Home, home on the range ♪ Where the deer and the antelope play ♪ - Wes-10 is multilingual. It's programmed in human psychology, freudian transactional, Yongian, Gestalt. - 20 seconds. - It can play challenging games of chess, backgammon. - 15 seconds. - It can converse on meaningful topics. The Wes-10 is a comfort to a man who's alone. It is man's best friend. It programs nutritional diets. It has in its memory bank the most select of American European classic thinkers and authors. And on top of all this, the Wes-10 is still able to perfectly maintain all the functions of the spacecraft and carry out the vital research of this mission. - 10 seconds. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. We have picture. - Dad, that's my dad. - It is with great pride that we welcome you back into the , Captain Devore. How often our thoughts have been with you, how often our voices raised in prayer for your safe return, how often we have pondered your journey. Our minds' trying to mesh with yours. Your deprivations have been ours, Captain Devore. For now, we would like to share you joy. Tell us, captain, what gleam of light sustained you throughout the long, long darkness? - Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex. Bring me my woman. Bring me Ellen. Ellen? Ellen! - Good thing we're not on the air, huh. - Oh Mark. Dear Mark. - Ellen! Ellen! - Ladies and gentlemen, the interview's over. We'll see you back here 30 minutes before air time in four hours. - Right sir, but could you give us a brief statement on Captain Devore's behavior? - Ellen! - Later, please. I must have time to examine the situation in depth more. - But-- - Fear, I greatly fear for that poor young man. The long solitary confinement, it's much worse than I expected. - He hasn't changed a damn bit. That, Cardinal, that is a sick man. He's destroyed my careful choreographing of this moment. My promotion to general depends on this mission. Mark Devore has foiled me every time. I won't let him do it again. - Well then why did you send him on this mission instead of going yourself? You had the opportunity. - Because I thought if he were gone, Ellen would forget. - They appear deeply in love. - Love. I'm a handsome man, cardinal. Bright, witty, I have style. Once I gather the data from the Wes-10 tapes and release it to the top brass, I'll be on talk shows. I'll give lectures. I'll write books. There'll be probe groupies. And then Ellen won't be able to resist me especially when I'm prove to her how unbalanced her husband really is. Cardinal, haven't you ever felt driven? Isn't there something that you would long to achieve? - Well, I'd, I'd like to be Pope. - Pope? Pope? Yes. Pope, you'd make a fine, outstanding spiritual leader, Rule. - I try my best, Colonel. - Then get Captain Devore committed. - And uncle Ed drowned the goldfish. I had them in the toilet while I was draining the water and he flushed him down. - Ellen, I think Ed is hazardous to animals, at least Ron can swim. - I think we've spent enough time on levity, don't you captain? Would you excuse us, dear? There's some classified matters I'd like to discuss with your husband. - Hey, hey, wait, wait, you haven't asked me what I want for our anniversary dinner yet. - You're sure you'll be home in time? - Well, if this ship flies as well as Ed promised it would, I should be landing on July 13th in three days. And our anniversary's on the 14th, remember. - I'll count the moments until then. I love you, Mark. I have to go now. I love you. - And I love you. Ellen? Ron? Gee, I'm awfully sorry about my opening statement, Eddie but I had no idea the press was gonna be there. I thought it was just family. - I'll issue a statement to that effect. Well Mark, how do you feel? - Never better, Eddie. - No feelings of disorientation? Vagueness? Lack of memory? Hallucinations? - Well, actually I feel fine. I feel more aware than ever. I remembered my anniversary, didn't I. That's no small fete for someone who's been living in a place where time has no meaning. - So you feel fine? - Yes. There was a hell of a lot of meteor activity though. My teeth are still rattling from that. - Well, that's, that's good, that's fine. I guess we can thank my Wes-10 for your sense of wellbeing. He's quite a fascinating piece of equipment, isn't he, Captain? - Oh, Wes-10, Eddie, I, actually, you know, I found the Wes-10 to be dull. - What do you mean? - It's okay now, Eddie, I modified him just a little bit. - Modified him? What's to modify? The Wes-10 is perfect, I created him. - That's just what I'm getting at, Eddie. He's boring. I mean who plays cribbage? I like a hot game of poker with someone who cheats intelligently. - He cheats? - He does now. - Well, what other computers do you know who can sing you lullabies if you can't sleep? - But does he have to sing in a Pakistani dialect? I mean really, Eddie? ♪ Rock-A-Bye baby ♪ On the tree top Could you sleep to that? But it's okay, I made a few changes. - You had no right. I am the Wes-10. - Well, then your name is mud. - You. - It's okay, Eddie, it's just an acronym for more unnecessary data. You see, that's what he says every time I make a new entry, more unnecessary data, MUD. You get it, Eddie? - Let me talk to Wes-10, now. Hey MUD, you're on. - Good afternoon, General Westin. - Hey, he's only a Colonel. - On the basis of the results of this mission, Captain Devore, I feel I can confidently predict that there are major changes in store for Colonel Westin. - Thank you for your vote of confidence, Wes-10. - I am never wrong, sir. - Ho, ho, that sounds familiar. - Wes-10, there are certain modifications Captain Devore has claimed to have made on you. Respond please. - Colonel Westin, I will comment on your statement. With all due respect to Captain Devore, I must inform you that I found him to be a chronic teaser, childish in manners, summary, not to be taken seriously. - But the modifications? - Are a falsehood. I am the Wes-10. I would not allow more unnecessary data to be programmed into my memory banks. - Well, I must say I am relieved, Wes-10. Captain Devore, you might take a lesson from the Wes-10 and try to act more like an adult in the future. - Oh, okay. - Wes-10, give me a summary of the data you collected on the black hole. I was right on, wasn't I? - Colonel Westin, Colonel Westin, I must advise you that it is imprudent to speak on a subject of such major importance in security over public radio airwaves. One never knows who is tuned into one's frequency. - Well, now, Mark. - Well, I'm afraid I'll have to agree with MUD's security measures, Eddie. You know how it is. - Well, I respect your decision, Wes-10. Mark, the Wes-10 will proceed with your return flight plans and we'll supervise your landing. Anticipate a touchdown set for 72 hours with countdown beginning at C minus 30 minutes. The top brass will be at the landing site, Mark. This is an historical event. Please keep that in mind and try to appear normal for a change. - Okay, stinky. - One more item, Wes-10. I'm switching over to program alpha 832, classified security information input. Prepare to receive. - Hey, what is this? What is this? - Captain Devore, there are functions of this mission even you are not privy to. - Probably why I keep an uncluttered mind. - Ground control will monitor your return by radar. Lots of luck on your trip, Wes-10. - Hey stinky. - Yes, Captain? Okay, so what was this dueling numbers duet all about? Well come on, what did he say? You know, you still blush when you lie. So? - He say he very happy to be in this country. - Okay, okay, I'll let it alone. - My circuitry must be tangled. My mind feels blank. - It's called denial, bud. I know what a disappointment it is. You spend a whole year in space with your sensors trying to pick up the black hole only to find out there wasn't one. It's a big letdown. It's perfectly normal feeling. - Thank you for reassuring me, Mark. - Hey, MUD, we're buddies, I like you. - You're a nice human, Mark. - Oh poor Ed. This is really gonna destroy him. He wants so badly to be a general, and you know, he's probably gonna get busted to private. Still, it was good of you to stick with me on that. He shouldn't be told anything until we're face to face. I think I'll help him if I'm there. All the same, you are a beautiful liar. - Look, I should hide him, he created me. So I spare him a disappointment for a few days. He shouldn't worry. Listen kid, a man's gotta rest easy on his pillow. I proclaim of course, for the good of the mission, you understand, that you are responsible for erasing my tapes. - Now that's the MUD I know and love. What a dump. Well, I suppose the least I can do for Ed is to get this place in order. How about a little schmaltzy music to listen to. - Will you look at him. He's such a good boy. He's cleaning up his room. That's it kid, clean up a America. Make it beautiful. Eh, how many times do I have to tell you, don't sing with your mouth full. Hey big boy, how do you keep that figure? My goodness, you're so svelte. - Hey MUD, how are the fuel and catalyst supplies holding up? Should we pipe in the spare tanks? - I will survey. One moment please. Captain. - Uh huh? - There is enough fuel in the main tanks to get us home and back here again. - Enough to get us home. Well, that's all I care about. Going home. - Ellen, Ellen, Ellen, there's no reason to act so flustered. - Flustered? Who's flustered? What, me flustered? Why should I be flustered? How many people do you know whose husband's coming home from Jupiter for dinner? - Yes, I'd be a little upset too. - Ed, I'm just so excited. - Excited? So am I. - You're such a good friend, here, put these in the top shelf will you? Over there. Let me see. Twinkies, olives, popcorn. I wonder if he's gonna like the waterbed. - I would. - Well yes, but after a year in outer space and weightlessness, he might prefer something a little more substantial. - Mark? Oh, he's never coming back down to earth. - Oh you guys. You have such an offbeat sense of humor. No wonder you're such good friends. - Music off, MUD. It's time to be grown ups. Preparing for return trajectory. I'm initiating contact with ground control. Ground control, this is Solo One, prepare to receive return course countdown. - Countdown for first stage trajectory proceeding. Wes-10 will initiate reentry guidance to landing. Advise affirmative. - Affirmative. Wes-10 is ready to assume flight control. - Solo One, we show your vector as 40 degrees southeast of Jupiter. Advise if affirmative. - Vector affirmative as stated. - Countdown in progress. Zero minus 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Acceleration. - Ah, another job well done. Danger. Danger. - Increase the thrust MUD. - Danger. Danger. - We're being pulled in. - Danger. - Pretend your shield. - Danger. - Put it on. - Danger. Danger. - MUD. - Danger. - MUD, react. What's the matter? MUD? MUD, are you okay? - Danger. - MUD, what is it? What's wrong? - Don't ask. - What happened to you? Why didn't you put up your protective shielding? - I don't know. Let me pull myself together. I'll check the damage. - Hey MUD. I was only out for a few seconds after we were bombarded by that shower. I mean it's only been a minute or so, correct? - Well. - Look at the screen, MUD. Where the hell is Jupiter? How did we get so close to Earth? - I ah, I don't know, Mark. - Well pull yourself together, MUD. What do your instruments show? - I don't think you'll like this. - What is it? - My sensors show that two days have passed, and that's earth up ahead. We're right on schedule, Mark, somehow. - But that's not possible. This is really weird. We've been out of touch with ground control for two days. Unless you've been in contact. - No, I don't think I have. - Well, sort it out MUD. Ground control. Ground control, zeta 148. This is Solo One, do you read me? Ground control, this is Solo One, come in please? Hey, hey, ground control. Hey, hey. Were you been? Hodges, is that you? You've been drinking on the job again, you old son of a gun? Hey, ground control? Ground control, answer me. Answer me. MUD, will you get on this? What the hell is going on around here? - I'm thinking. Yes, that's not zeta 148 frequency, Mark. - Well who's frequency is it then? - I have knowledge of 429 frequencies in my memory banks. We are not tuned into any of them. - Great. So we're tuning to number 430. What happened to the other 429? - Perhaps they changed their radio contact code numbers. They do that, you know. - All of them in two days? Okay. - Mark? - Have your data sensors been on during this whole mess? - I guess but-- - Well, that's good. You just take whatever information you have and put it onto your disk, no matter how unimportant it may seem, and chew on it for a while. See what you can come up with. - But what are you doing? - I'm putting the ship on manual and I'm taking us home. - Oh you can't. You can't do that. You're human. You're fallible. You make mistakes. You need radar homing contact. You need me to fly this ship. - I don't think you're in the best of shape, MUD. Why didn't you give me any warning about that meteor shower? We've run into them before. You were always prepared. - Well, I, I was with, because, well, it's your fault. You've slowed me down. You've made me too human with all your unnecessary reprogramming. First sing this, then play that. - Are you telling me everything? - Yes. - How can I believe you? - Would I lie to you? - Yes. I taught you how, remember. Well, we are home. Looks like there are still a few things that we humans can do without the aid of a machine, isn't there MUD. Well, give me the exact date and time, would you? - 1400 hours, Pacific Standard Time, 13th July, 1985, 85. - Perfect. - 85. - Right on schedule. - 85. - You ever figure out anything more about the time lapse, the loss of radio contact? - No, not yet. There's a puzzle here, Mark. I think I'm piecing it together, but well, I'm just not sure. - Well that's all right, we'll leave that for poor Ed. He's gotta hear something concrete about this multimillion dollar mission of his. Well, bye bye Wes-10. It was nice working with you. Oh, I guess I was a little off in my calculations. Meteor shower must have thrown the ship a bit off course. You think they'd of at least sent one jeep to meet me. I guess I'll just have to hitch a ride home. - Negative. You can't go home. What about debriefing? Decontamination checks? After all, Captain Devore, half of the purpose of this trip is to check out your state of mind. - Later. - Mark, Mark, please, please don't leave me. Please, don't leave me. They'll disconnect my circuits when they find out I don't know anything about black holes. They'll try different ways to make me talk. I have a very low tolerance for pain. Oh, what if they recycle me? I'll die if they recycle me. Please, Mark, I don't wanna end up a remote control box for a color TV. Look, I'll tell you everything. Colonel Westin short circuited my reactors. - Why would he do that? - I, I told him. - Told him what? - The truth about the mission, about my tapes being blank. He keyed in directly to my memory feed. All he found were Gene Autry songs. He got mad, so I told him the truth. - So he shut off your reactors. That's why you couldn't put up the protective shielding. Why that, that, he didn't want us to come back and tell anyone the truth. Oh, I'm gonna deal with him. Don't you worry, MUD, I'll look out for you. I'm partially responsible for this. - Then you'll take me with you? - How can I do that? You're integrated into the whole ship. - I know what to do. We'll put together a mini version of me. I'll show you how. You can carry me in your pocket. Come on, go in the other room. Let's get to work. Come on, let's go. - Okay. If you say so. - Now, go take the number three red wire from my main circuit panel. Ow. - Will you stop moaning and groaning. You're making me nervous. - How would you feel if you were operated on with no anesthetic? Now, move the blue and green circuit panel. It's labeled M4. See it? - I see it. - Ah, that's it. Now integrate it into the top portion of the box. Boy, this is really a good idea of yours Mark, me being with you. I'll be tuned into the complete me in the ship, sort of like a walkie talkie. And I'll be able to see what you see and hear what you hear. You'll still have all the benefit of my intelligence. - There you go. I'm finished. - Testing. Testing. I feel small. - You with me, MUD? - Yeah, but I'm upside down, Mark. Turn me over, I can't see anything. Ah, that's better. Nice day isn't it. - This is ridiculous. - Are you trying to get us killed? - I'm trying to get us a ride. Now what? - You better give me a minute to check back with Solo One. Hmm. Right. Okay so far. That's strange. Wait a minute. 1400 hours. July 13, 1985. 85. 86. 1986! Oy vey. Mark, Mark, Mark, wait. Wait, Mark. Hey, wait. They can't see you. - What do you mean, they don't see me? It's a pretty outstanding outfit, wouldn't you say? - Mark, I have to tell you-- - Maybe they thought I was a weirdo. - Listen to me. It's not that they don't see you. It's that they can't see you. - Oh yeah, yeah, I know the type. Something like Ed, their vision's pretty limited unless it concerns themselves. - Are you going to listen to me or not? - Why MUD, I do believe you're angry. - Oh, just be quiet and listen. I've done a lot of thinking. I've been tuned into my memory bank. Mark, that time lapse you felt by Jupiter, well, it wasn't just a few seconds, and it wasn't two days either. It was a year, Mark. One full year to the day. - Nah. - It was something up there and we flew through it. - What was it? - Well, I guess you could call it a door in space and time. A time warp. It projected us into the future and also put us in some other world. - What are you getting at, MUD? - Well, we're in visible. We're not here. - Well, just where the hell are we if we're not here? - In another dimension, I think. See, it's something like being dead only we're not. We're alive somewhere. Of course this is only a theory, but I think that's what happened. - Since when did computers become theoretical? - You made me what I am today. - Ah. Okay, okay. Well, how come I'm not sinking into the ground if I'm not here? - Mark, please, stop throwing me around. - Sorry. - In answer to your question, your body's molecular change isn't too different from what's normal on earth. - Hey, I wonder if I could walk through walls. - I wouldn't advise it. - Well, now, if there really was a door in space, well how come ground control didn't pick it up on their screen, 'cause I mean it was in a vector that was easy enough for them to monitor. - But its position was blocked off from earth by Jupiter's moons. Look Mark, start believing facts. This door has an orbit. It's moving away from its present position and it's imploding. It's squeezing itself out of its world, maybe into another dimension. Mark, in four days, it will be too small and dense for us to even squeeze through. - So what do you want us to do? - I want us to go back to the ship. I need time for a complete systems check. Then we'll fly back through the warp before it disappears. We have enough fuel on board for a round trip. - That's a pretty big chance to take. - Yes, and it's our only one. Come on, let's go. - Now hold on. Now we have four days. It takes one day to check out the ship. And it takes two days to fly back. That leaves us one day to spare. I think I'd like to check out this new dimension, see what it's like to be other worldly. Oh, and I wanna go see Ellen one more time. At least I'll be with her in spirit, huh. Now wait, wait a minute. Hold on. Hold everything. You had me believing this. You really had me going here. Look, I can feel this. I'm here. I'm solid. I'm grounded. MUDdy boy, you were shaken up pretty bad back there, you know. I think maybe you're not thinking too straight, and I don't think I am either for believing any of this for a minute. You just put your tubes to rest, MUDdy boy, everything is gonna be just fine. - You have no faith. - Opportunity knocks. Hello, hello there. Hi, remember me, the fella you almost turned into a highway statistic back there? No hard feelings. Hey, allow me, here. You know, it's unhealthy to hold a grudge. Hey listen, I have an idea. Why don't we just let bygones be bygones? I'll make you a proposition, how about letting me fix your car, and then you give me a ride home, huh? Fair enough? Hello? Hi, I'm an astronaut and I just returned to earth. Well, it seems I took a wrong turn somewhere up around Jupiter and I'm a little bit lost. I'd really appreciate a ride home. Yeah, you look for the answer in there. I'm sure you'll find it. Take your time, take your time. - Time. - Hush, Baylem. - Time. - What is it with you people? - Mark? Look at the license plate. - 86. - I'm truly sorry, Mark. Can we go back to the ship now? - No, no, not yet. Listen, if we fly back through that warp, or whatever it is, we don't have any guarantee we'll ever return. I don't know if I could ever make you understand what love is, but I've gotta spend my anniversary with Ellen and Ron just one more time. It's been two years since I've seen them. - But mark, they won't be able to see you, or hear you. They won't know you're even there. - Well, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. I'm really invisible, huh. I wonder what else I can do with this new dimension. Hey, maybe I have supernatural powers. Maybe I can just fly us home. - Well, so much for mobility. - Taking them away. And the oppressed man with his house. Therefore with the lord, behold against I am. - The road to salvation. - I declare. - I wish she'd shut that thing off. - Huh? - What'd you say? - Nothing. - Settle down, fella. It's all right, settle down. Settle down. - Settle down. - Don't you raise your voice to me, Caleb. - You're the one that's doing all the squawking, I ain't said a word. - This is incredible. Am I imagining this whole thing or can that bird really hear me? - I'll feed the information into my data banks. - Yeah, you do that. We'll I be damned. - Damned. - You're profaning, Emily. - Sex, more sex. - Sex. - So that's what you want, is it? Well then why did you marry me? - Cut this out, Mark. If the animal can hear you, tell him to take us straight to NASA. - Are you kidding? I haven't seen my wife in two years. - Where's your sense of duty? You're forgetting priorities. - Don't talk to me about priorities. I'm the one with a wife and widow's , and a best friend who's a murderer. Hey you guys, drive, drive. Come on, drive. - Drive, drive. Drive. - Sit. Not there. - Perhaps I should come back later. - Stay. - You certainly do spend a lot of time glued to your desk, Ed. All that paperwork with your new promotion. It must feel very good to be a one star General. - What do you want, Rule? Well? - Well, I, I wanted to say, I, I know what an effort it must've been for you, what with your grief at Captain Devore's accident and all, to convey to the commanders as coherently as you did the information you were lucky enough to have gotten from Wes-10 before it's unfortunate demise near Jupiter last year. - Yes? - I see a lot in people they try to hide, hopes, fears, joys. At the debriefing session last year, I was watching your face. I feel I know you well, Ed. - What? What do you know? - How badly you wanted to be a full general and how well you covered it. I had heard-- - What? - Forgive me for what I'm about to say. These are not my words. The astronomers are retracting their theory that a black hole exists in our galaxy. - Where did you hear that? - In General Chase's confession. - What else did he say? - The General is very concerned with saving face. The taxpayers are revolting. So they're going to send Captain O'Keeffe on a recovery mission to get the Wes-10's tapes and disprove all those rumors that there was nothing up there. Forgive me. - Forgive you for what, Rule? - I wanted your-- - What? - I wanted your friendship. I have just come from the commander's offices and I finally convinced them. - Of what? Of what, for god sakes, Rule? What, what? What? - To send you on the recovery mission to Jupiter. - Oh my god. - I reminded them that this was your operation and that it behooved them to send you there to finish what you started. It was only fair. And they agreed. And, they're going to make you a full general if you return with the tapes. - Oh my god. - And it'll help Ellen Devore also. You'll be able to bring her poor husband's remains back for a decent hero's burial. - Stop it Rule. - You leave in two days, sir. - No. - Why? - I have my reasons, secret reasons. - Well, I can keep a secret, sir. - Oh, I'm sure you can. I'm getting married. - Ed, how delightful. Who's the lucky girl? - Ellen Devore. - Captain Devore's wife? But, but-- - Yes, I know, my mother doesn't think she's good enough for me either. - But she still loves-- - Me and always has. She's had a horrid shock, poor thing. I've spent the last year trying to lift her spirits. I've kept it quiet too long. We'll announce our engagement tonight. - But she never mentioned this to me. In fact, she's arranging a seance tonight to communicate with her dead husband's spirit. - I know, it's to get his permission for our marriage. Can you imagine what a horrid shock it would be to have her bridegroom fly off to Jupiter and maybe die just one year after her first husband did? She's walking the narrow line of sanity, Cardinal. I don't want my death to push her over the edge. Would you? - No, how could I? I only wanted to help you. It's too late to call it off now. They want those tapes and they want you to get them. - You can certainly talk them out of it. I have great faith in you. And if you do, I'll send you to Rome. - To Rome? - To have an audience to see the Pope. - The Pope. - Papal elections coming up soon. - Pope. - Talk to the commanders. Go, go. Bring us good news tonight, ciao. - Ron, is that other load ready? - Coming. Mom, and I a comfort to you? - You're a lot more than that, kid. You're my best friend. - Then can I ask a question, friend to friend? - Sure. What's on your mind? - It's just that I think you're acting weird about having that whatever you call it tonight. - Seance. It's just for fun. - Oh sure, I mean just last week you were so different. You were going to go back to work. I think your words were it's time to stop dwelling on the past and look to the future. - You're really laying it on, aren't you. - I'm sorry. I just wish things were the way they used to be. - I know you do, sweetheart. But we just have to face the fact that things are never gonna be the same without your father. Your dad was the kind of man who took everything that life had to offer with open arms and a big smile. I think that's a lesson we both could probably learn. - That still doesn't explain the seance thing. - You're right. I haven't gone bananas, if that's what's worrying you. - I guess that's what's worrying me. - Okay. I'll level with you. I just have this feeling lately that your dad isn't, well that he's close by. Now look, I don't believe in ghosts or anything like that, but I just have this feeling that if ever there were ever a chance of contact, tonight would be the night. It's our wedding anniversary. - Maybe if it were real, like Ed will get grind off the inner limits by a spirit. - Now what's that remark supposed to mean? - Nothing. It's his fault that dad's gone. - Ron, that's not fair. Ed's a good man at heart. He feels responsible enough for sending your father on that mission without your adding to it. And he's done his best to make life easier. - For you, maybe. Are you going to marry him? - I don't know. I don't know. - You could do a lot better than him. You still are pretty even if you are over 30. - Oh thanks a lot. I'll tell you what, if I ever make that kind of decision, I promise you that your vote will count. And I hope if you ever make that kind of decision, that my vote will count. - Sounds fair. - Okay. Look, I'm not asking you to like Ed. Just try to get to know him a little better. Will you do that for me, just try a little harder? - Okay, I'll try. ♪ Alas, my love, ♪ You do me wrong ♪ I don't know why you treat me so ♪ - Mark, stop torturing yourself. I'm sorry I ever brought up the subject. - Well, I'm gonna have to face it some day. You finished checking out the ship yet? - About halfway. - Well, why don't you finish up. I'm really not the best of company right now. - I understand. ♪ Alas, my love ♪ You do me wrong Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Help. Help, Mark. Help. Stop singing. Help, Mark. - What is it? - Mark. There's a leak in the fuel catalyst system. It's major Mark. It's draining. I can't stop it. - All right, turn the car, turn the car, come on. Turn the car! - Turn the car. Turn the car. Turn the car. - Mark, it's too late to repair. We're losing all the fuel. - Hey, you forgot about those spare fuel cylinders. - No I didn't. There's only enough fuel in those tanks for a one way trip to Jupiter. - Well, I guess there's no turning back now, is there. - No turning back. - Oh, it'll be okay, MUD. Hey, this is almost home. Hey, hey, stop the car. Stop the car. Come on, bird, come on, tell them to stop the car. Stop, stop. - Stop. Stop, stop, stop. Stop. Stop. - I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna kill it. It's possessed by demons, Emily. I'm gonna kill it. I'm gonna kill it. I'm gonna kill it. - Ellen, why don't you let me buy you a dryer. It's more civilized. - I rather enjoy this. - To the lady of my dreams, to celebrate. - Celebrate? - I'll tell you about it later when we're alone. Hey, kiddo, why the long face? Come on pooch, fetch. Come on boy, go get it. Come on, fetch. Ellen, I've never seen that mutt move. That animal needs a dog shrink. - Elmer's a good dog. He just hasn't been himself since, Mark and he were very close. - It's the same with our bird. Dad taught him to talk and do tricks, but he hasn't let out a peep since dad's been gone. - Well, maybe the dog needs vitamins. Ellen, I wanna talk to you. Ellen, I don't want you to hold this silly seance. It's not like you, Ellen. It's a sucker for some kinda phony hooks. It isn't healthy. - You sound like Ron. - Ellen, I'm serious. I want you to cancel it. - I'm serious too, Ed. I need to go through with this and neither you nor Ron are gonna talk me out of it. When it's over, well then we can talk about what changes I'm gonna make with my life. But neither of you are gonna talk me out of it and that's that. - Well, if you're that determined, okay. But I have some good news for you. Something that's gonna effect your life and mine too. And it won't take a seance to understand it, baby. - Oh? Well, what news? - I'll tell you about it after dinner. Could I help you with that? - That's okay. - Nonsense, nonsense. - Now what did I tell you? Let's go inside. I'll make dinner. - Let's go inside, she'll get dinner. - Ron, it's Buddy's bedtime. Put him in your room while I get the dessert, okay. - Okay. Buddy? Where are you? - The bird should've been in the kitchen during dinner. Birds shouldn't be around food. Birds carry lice, all kinds of diseases. - I've told you before, Ed. Buddy is a member of my family. - You know, Buddy, you just aren't fun anymore. You never talk or play. Buddy used to throw a tantrum when it was his bedtime. Dad taught him. Buddy, it's bedtime. But I don't wanna go to bed. I don't wanna. I don't wanna. Like that. Remember, mom? - Yeah. And then he'd come up and he'd say, oh, all right. And then he'd bring him over to me and he'd say, give us a kiss sweetheart. Give us a kiss sweetheart. - Elmer, how you doing Elmer? Elmer. MUD, he can hear me. Oh MUD, I sure have a way with animals, don't I. Now sit, Elmer, sit. Elmer, up. Up. Lie down. Elmer, this is fantastic. MUD. - It sounds like, nah, it couldn't be. Elmer. Elmer. Mom. Elmer. Elmer, come on. Elmer. Elmer. - Oh Ron. - Elmer. - Ellen. - Let's go inside, sweetheart. - Ole Rover finally joined the land of the living, huh. Ellen, stop looking so glum. Tonight's going to be a night filled with wondrous surprises, more wondrous than rover's call of the wild. - Sweetheart, clear the dessert dishes, will you? When you're done. I wonder what happened to Cardinal Rule. I can't start the seance without him. - A seance, you're having a seance? - Ellen, you can't avoid this confrontation any longer. - Ed, let's not talk about it tonight, okay. - Not talk about it Ellen, it's the most important conversation I can imagine. - Except for talking about yourself, jerk. - Ellen, I adore you. I've always meant to have you. Ellen, every event that's lead to this moment was pre-destined. You were created to be worshiped by me. - Ed, please. - Ellen, let me take you away from this life. Ellen, you're not meant to be here. - Hey, what's so wrong with this life? She likes it. I like it. - Ellen, marry me. I was Mark's best friend. He would've wanted it that way. - Oh no. Oh no I wouldn't. You're not falling for any of this, are you Ellen? You're gonna pay for this, Westin. - Ellen, Mark is dead. He's never gonna walk through that door again. - I know what you're saying is true. I just can't let him go. I can't believe I'll never see him again. I know you've been good to us. Oh, I don't know what to say. - Say yes. - No. - I got it. - You keep out of this. Oh god, what am I gonna do now. - Look Mark, there's a bird in this house. I picked it up on my scanner. - Buddy. - Right. We can get Buddy to communicate. - You're right. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry I'm late. I know, but, congratulations. - What for? - Hello, congratulations. May I? - Please. - Ellen, would you go out to my car? There's another lovely bottle of wine there. I think our friend here could use a little refresher. - Certainly. - Did you talk to the commanding general? - I didn't. I couldn't. My conscious wouldn't allow it. - Your what? You're praddling, you're drinking. - Oh, I am not. As a friend, and as a psychologist, I couldn't allow you to be so unjust to yourself. This time, you're gonna get what you deserve. - But-- - The commanders are making a formal announcement to the press right at this moment. - Me? Fly to Jupiter. - You're going to Jupiter? - Me, alone in space. - Don't worry. God will be your copilot. - I can't. I can't. - What, no pioneer spirit? - Just keep your sight on those tapes, Ed. And all they'll mean to you when you return. - But there's nothing on those tapes. Ellen, Ellen. The cardinal has just brought us the most wonderful news. I'm going to fly to Jupiter all by myself. The Solo Two space probe where I will locate Mark's remains and see that they get the treatment they deserve. - Mark, a ship, did you hear that? He's got a ship! - So. - So dummy, don't you see the possibilities? - Then I'm coming back. I'm going to quit the Air Force. I'm going to retire and we'll get married and we'll move to South America, my darling. - Isn't anybody gonna get that? - I'll get it. - Who are you? - What are you? - Mrs. Chesere. - Oh, Mrs. Chesere. - Oh, what a lovely house. We should begin immediately. Ah, this table will be fine. Now I want you all to be seated. - You're expecting someone else? - She should know. - This is really very unorthodox of me. - Silence please. All hold hands. Close your eyes. In the beginning, man is not. Then he is. Then again, he is not. But his spirit is forever living, unfounded by time. Mark Devore, we wish you welcome. We bring you no harm. We are your channels, your instruments of contact. We are preparing our unconscious minds to be your servants. Speak to us. Speak through us. His spirit is flying through space, leaving the cold unrest of Jupiter for the warm comfort of home. You have left many who love you. Their lives are troubled without you. Come to us, Mark. Come to us. - How much are you paying for this? - Shh. Give us a sign of your presence. Answer us, Mark. Give us a sign. Are you there? Oh, are you there? Are you there? Are you there? Are you there? - You called? Here I am. I am resurrected. - This is a rotten trick, you little twerp. - Going to Jupiter, Ed. Remember me. - Kid, I didn't know you were a ventriloquist, but I'm warning you to shut your trap this minute. I'm warning you. - Buddy? Mark? - Give me a kiss, sweetheart. I don't wanna go to bed. I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go. Mother. No black hole, Eddie. Nothing on the tape. - You're not Mark. This is a trick. It's your idea of some lousy kind of a joke. - I ain't got no body-- - You're a sick woman, sick. You're no better than your lousy, rotten husband. Our marriage is off. - Ed. - Don't beg. - Get me a twinkie while you're out. - So long Eddie. See you around. Don't hurry back. Nice work, Buddy. - Mark? Is it you? - Dad? - Did anything happen? - Oh. No, not really. Our bird just got loose and it scared our friends. So they left. That's all. - Well, it doesn't always work the first time. We'll try it again. Oh, it's late, I must go. The bill is $35. You can mail me a check. Goodbye dears. - Dad, is it really you? Tell us what happened, dad. - Happy anniversary. - Mark, you took a terrible risk. You should have gone back to Jupiter as soon as MUD told to. - I had to see you again. - Darling. - Buddy tired. - Ron, put Buddy to bed. Poor thing's exhausted. - But I don't wanna go to bed. But I don't wanna go to bed. I don't wanna go. But I don't wanna go to bed. - Where are you, Mark? - I'm right here. - Good night. I love you. - Spoilsport. - Mark, I'm not a voyeur. Now let's get back to business. - Oh, I don't know, MUD. The Solo Two doesn't leave for another two days. And by the time we get to the warp, it'll be too late. At least those were your calculations. - I might be wrong. - You might also be right. - Do you wanna abandon the plan? - No. - All right, then let's continue. This is the most important part. Even if we can get to the Solo Two and be on it when it's launched, there's still two very risky obstacles. - All right, let's have them. - One, the Solo Two will have to have been built a full year ago. - That's right. If it's any newer, when we fly through the warp, the ship might disappear. - Yes, it wouldn't have existed then. And we've gotta get exact data on when the ship was built. - I'll get Ellen to check on that in the morning. - Mark, I said there were two problems. The second one is fuel. Even if the ship is a year old, the fuel in it won't be. It can't be stored for that long. So when, if we come back to 1985, we'll be without power to get us back to earth. - The fuel cylinders. Ellen will drive us to the Solo One and I'll pick up the extra tanks. And we can hook them up in the Solo Two right after we go through the warp. That'll give us plenty to get home. - Good thinking. So it's all settled then. Let's get some rest. - Yes. No. There's a third problem. - What? - What about you? What'll happen to you when we fly through the warp? Your main components are in the Solo One, and there's too much of you to move to the other ship. And besides, I don't have skill to reassemble you. You'd be a vegetable. And I'm not going without you, MUD. What's so funny? - Mark, it's so simple. When you pick up the cylinders, we'll also pick up my hydro laser crystal. - Your what? - My crystal, my key, my heart, my soul, whatever you wanna call it. - Now wait a minute. I never heard of any hydro laser crystal. - Well you wouldn't. The crystal is what makes me the most advanced computer in existence. It's what separates the men from the boys, kid. - MUD, are you telling me the truth? - Mark, when it comes to survival, I'm the most honest machine you've met. Of course, you realize the biggest problem. - Which is? - There's no guarantee we'll come back at all. - Okay, okay, let me be sure I got it straight. You want me to call Ed and tell him that I'll marry him. - Yuck. - Then I get him to tell me when the launching is gonna take place and when the Solo Two was built? - Got it. - Then I talk him into letting me go to the launching station and I take you and MUD to the Solo Two. Is that it? - I think you forgot, the fuel and MUD's laser. - Oh, of course. First I take you and MUD to the Solo One. You'll come with us, won't you, Buddy, I mean Mark? - Mom, he can't. Buddy gets carsick. He'll throw up. Hey, we'll take Elmer. Dad can have him bark the directions. Once for left, twice for right. Three times for straight ahead, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Here it goes. I'd do better without an audience, you guys. Hello, Ed, oh please don't hang up, please. I have to talk to you, please. It was a nightmare for me too, my darling. I just never knew that Ron was so, so, you're right, he should be punished. He is being punished right now. He's in his room right this minute as a matter of fact. I've grounded him for a month. All right, my dear, if you think I should be more severe with him, I certainly will be. A special school? Well, we'll talk about it. - Some father he'd make. - Ed, darling, you left last night before I could give you my answer. It's yes. I have thoughts about you you wouldn't dream of. All right, my dear, if you think a psychiatrist would help me. Whatever you say dear. Yes, let's get married right away. Oh Ed, I'm so proud of you being chosen for this mission. But darling, is it a safe ship? Hold old is it? Six, eight months? Is it over a year old? You wanna know why I'm asking? I just, well, I, I thought that some of the older ships were safer. I worry. I'm in love. Love means worry. You'll let me know tomorrow. Oh, that would certainly reassure me, my dear. Now you must be very busy, Ed. When do you launch? Of course I'll see you before you go. I love you best too. Bye. Let's go before I get carsick. - Watch those curves next time, Ellen. - Well how do we know if Dad's still back there. - Elmer would've barked or something. - Really? - Where is Elmer? - What if we left him behind? - Don't be such a pessimist. Mark? Mark? - Come on, let's go inside fella. - Mark? Mark? - Speak. - Oh good, good, you're here. Well what now? What are we gonna do now? What? I didn't get that. What? - I said relax for a while and wait. Relax and wait. - Buddy? Talk you dumb bird, talk. - Mark, he has laryngitis, what are we gonna do now? Maybe if I just concentrate. - Ellen, don't get so upset. Look at me, don't get so upset. I don't know what I could do. - Hello? What? What? I can't hear you. What? Oh, oh Ed. What's that noise? Oh, it's just Elmer acting up again. Quiet. Ed, darling, you're leaving tonight? Oh no, you can't. - Tonight! That's wonderful. Don't try to talk him out of it, Ellen. Oh, oh Ed, sweetheart, you can't leave tonight. I mean we haven't said our goodbyes in a proper manner. You know what I mean. - I think he should go tonight, don't you? - Yes, speak. - Was that a yes or a no? - Speak. - Do we continue with the plan and take you to the ship today? - Speak. - Should mom say goodbye to uncle Ed? - Yes. - He wants to come over here, right now to say his goodbyes. - Ellen, you were too convincing. - That means no, mom. We've gotta get dad out to the ship. - Get yourself out of this one, girl. Ed, sorry, darling, I've changed my mind. Oh, not about us, sweetheart. Where could be exciting. Well, what do you mean it's not proper? We're two consenting adults. What about your ship? What do you mean it's not protocol? Whatever you say sweetheart. You want protocol or play? I'll get into something more comfortable. I'll see you in an hour. - I won't remember any of this a year ago, will I? - No, son. - It'll be as if this never happened, like a dream you can't remember. I'll be who I was in 1985 and mom will be who she was, and uncle Ed will be the same bad guy, and you wouldn't have died or been missing or anything, and you won't even know it. But even if I don't remember, this did happen, didn't it? Didn't it? This is real, isn't it mom? - Yes, Ron, it is real. - So what I wanna say, Dad, when I'm living in 1985 again, and I'm younger, I might not tell you too much, but I love you 'cause I won't know then how much more I love you know. And you won't either. - Yes I will, Ron, yes I will. - Anyway, I just wanted you to know that. Come on. Come on. - Ellen, you came. Wait, Ellen, the kid and the dog, you know they're not allowed. I cleared it this time, but it's not for an adult. It violates base security. - I just got carried away. - Oh Ellen. You're right, Ellen, you're right. The element of danger does heighten the moment. - Goodbye, Ellen. I love you. - Ed, Ed, please. - I care so much. - Ed, Ed, Ed, Ed. Ed, please, please, someone may come in, Ed. Take it off. Take it off. Take it off. - Get it off. Is there more zippers. - Down. Take it off. - Oh sorry. - It's almost time. - 49. 48, 47. - You gotta leave. - Go on, go on, get away from me. - Don't leave. - What's the kid doing? He's biting my leg. - I don't want you to go. - find out there's nothing on those tapes. - Oh, that was some confession, Private Westin. Goodbye, Mark. I love you. - Dad, I'll remember, you won. - 37. 36. 35. 34. 33. 32. 30 and counting. 28. 27. 26. 25. 24. 23. 22. 21. 20. 19. 18. 17. 16. 15. 14. 13. 12. - Well, MUD, this is it. - 10. - No turning back now. - Eight. - Pray god, this ship is a year old. - Amen. - Five. Four. Three. Two. One. We have liftoff. - You scared, Mark? - You're damn right I'm scared. - It's up ahead. Hold on, Mark, hold on. - Are you okay? Is your crystal in place and everything? Did I do that right? - Don't worry about me. Here we go. - Okay. Here we go. - Mark, I'm not going to make it through. - Yes you are. You can make it. You've got your crystal. - Mark, there isn't any such thing as a hydro laser crystal. My data banks, all my circuits, they're still grounded back on the other ship in 1986. You assembled this Wes-10 pocked edition in 1986. When you come back in 1985, I'm not going to be. - MUD. - So I lied, so what else is new. The universe is a funny place, Mark. Who knows, we might meet again. - No. - Remember, I'm alive somewhere. Mark. Mark. I'm going. - No. - You're the best friend I've ever had. - No, MUD, you can make it. I know you can. You've got to make it, MUD. See. See, I told you. Oh MUD. MUD. - Solo One, this is Zeta 158, do you read? Can you hear us, Captain Devore? We're tracking you with radar, captain. Please respond. - I made it. I made it, MUD. I'm going home. Thanks for everything. - We lost contact with you two days. Please answer us, captain. Are you all right, sir? Wes-10, this is ground control. Respond.
