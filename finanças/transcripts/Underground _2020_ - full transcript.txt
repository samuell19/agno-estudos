The explosives may have gone off on 4-50. The whole level blew up, we're missing five guys. If the guys loading in 15 weren't on site, they may only be hurt by the shock wave. If that's the case, we have to find them. But if they were on site, we can expect the worst. The guy next to them in 13 probably set off the blast with his drilling rig. If that happened, the drill might've fallen on him. So go straight to 15, but on the way, check out 3 and 13. -Clear? -Yeah. Let's go gang. Good luck. UNDERGROUND There they are! My victim just threw up. I've got two code reds. I'll bring up the one who's awake. Can I split up my team? Team split approved. Everyone, we're going back up. Max, get the basket, we're going up. Max! -What are you doing? -Going to get the others. No, you're coming up with us. I'm not leaving anyone behind. Max, you'll put yourself in danger. We can save these two guys here. Let's get the fuck out. -Like hell. -Max, stop! Fuck off. I'm going. Go after him! Max, get the fuck over here. Let go, fuck! 2 MONTHS EARLIER -Everything clear? -Yup. You're okay in here and up here? -Yes sir. -Here he comes. Seb, you're with me today. -He's not going on the Jumbo? -You bet. No shit, man. He's a good one, he's got heart. Have a good day, boys! Geez, what a prick. Wait, wait. Alex had a run-in with her too. Alex isn't the benchmark! -Who? -Vaness. The barmaid at the club? She really gets around, man. She's screwed everyone. Ah, shit. He was sure he'd found the one. She was fucking dirty though. I filmed her blowing me, she made a real show of it. I got a great POV. I'll sell it to you, 50 bucks. Shut your mouth man. Come on, get in. You started drinking again, eh? -C'mon, don't be jealous. -Don't get greedy, you. That'll be the day. -Don't move the line so much. -Okay. Doing okay? Fucking awesome. -Time for you to retire, buddy. -Don't say that! Hello? You fucker. Hey man, what are you doing? With your mom? No, no. Myself. That's a good hike, you'll be feeling it tomorrow. That Julien? Say hello to him. Alex says hello. Okay. Well, tell him that if he wants to say hello to me he can do it himself. What flavour did you get? Why are you calling me? I just wanna know what's new with you. Nothing. Nothing. Bye, Max. Francis! Hi Julien. It's been awhile. What's up? Well, I'm working on physio. You guys? We're expecting, end of August. Holy shit, good job. And we're building a house. Ah, shit! We want to be ready for when the beast shows up. Yes. See you next time. Where? Where are you building? The development outside of town. Oh yeah, it's... Yeah, it's a nice spot. That, I, before, I seen it. Take care now. Yes. You. -Check your seal, okay Max? -Yeah. Down on three. One, two, three. -Starting CPR. -Wait till he's done. Jesus, I know. -Lift your hands. -What? Keep going but lift the front of your hands. -What? -Keep pumping! Shut up! Did it go well? Do we need to clear anything up? I think we all need to review team hierarchy and basic protocol. Anybody having trouble following the team leader? I find that the protocol slows us down. It's there for a reason. Protocols are for everyone's safety. But it sucks if we can't save someone because we're following protocol. Yes it sucks, but if there are victims, we can't put the rescuers' lives in danger. I get it, but we could've moved faster. No! When you can't see, you don't go forward. Okay. Safety first. That's not hard to understand, is it? If you can't get it, I'll call the director of Rescue Operations and someone will lose their certification, is that clear? Who's winning? My dad, of course. A word of advice to those without kids: don't fucking make 'em. What's the problem? Since I've been here, the little one got the gastro, passed it on to the baby, then to my girlfriend. And if that wasn't enough, the little one's teething. My home's a fucking mess and I'm stuck here, I can't help. -That's the job. -It still pisses me off. What do your girlfriends do? Mine has a fucking tough time. Facetime is great and all that, but there are limits. You gotta help out when you're home. When I'm there, I make the meals. Baloney and chips? Go fuck yourself. I don't make poor man's food. It's Haute Cuisine, the whole bit. I bet you don't do the dishes, though. I have my limits. To each his own task. Gotta keep your foreman's hands nice and soft, eh? Fuck you. And draw two cards. Shit, I just sunk the eight ball. You didn't pass on any of your talent to that poor child? Here. Mario, your turn to play. Don't feel like it. C'mon. It was stuck in the ice. You okay? This week, let's bring Julien out on the boat. On the boat? Like in the good old days. I told you, I don't feel like seeing him. Ah, come on. It'll do him good, he's in a rough spot. That's fucking cold that you won't see him. I know, but seeing him like that, I don't know what to fucking say. Same as before. He hasn't changed up here. I feel all screwed up around him, he makes me uncomfortable, that's it, that's all. Hi. I'm glad you're home. Any new exercises to show me? Same. It's been the same ones for a while now. No progress? No. I spoke to your physiotherapist. She says you're going through a bad time. Yeah, it isn't easy. Is that why you want to find a little job? Yup. Listen to me, Julien. Your mom would never say it, but people will laugh at you if you do that. Just a job, while I wait. Who's gonna hire you? There's not a lot you can do. But it's just to do something. I just don't want you hitting a wall. Yeah, that's good, it's moving. Go, go, you can do it. Yeah, that's it! Look, it's moving a bit. You can do it, that's my boy. Hello babe. You're fucking gorgeous. -Cool, you tanned. -Shut the fuck up! Hey, I'm darker than you. Shit, yeah. It's possible that at first, I might not be very good at changing diapers. Me neither at first, we'll be learning as we go. Why, are you stressed out? No, but... -You are stressed. -No. It's only normal. I've never changed diapers. And, you know, I don't have much experience with babies. At first, I might forget to hold its head. You won't. Believe me. It'll be your baby, you'll want to take care of it. Everything'll be fine. You'll be a great dad. Shit. Hey! What are you doing here? I told you not to come back here. I can tolerate you at the mine, but not here. -I don't want to say it again. -Stop. I asked him to come. Mario, I'm just here to help. Come on, Julien! Excuse me. May I see the manager, please? That's me. Ah! Okay. Well, I've come to leave my... -CV? -Yup. You were a miner? But I had a... With a car. I'm not... I'm not up to working at the mine, but in the meantime, I'm good to go for... -Okay. -To work. What skills do you have? Well, I'm sociable, and I'm resourceful. But, my... His hand is... My hand is like... This one's good, I can... There's lots of stuff... To work here, you need basic skills. We can't hire just anybody off the street. C'mon, that's a bit much. This isn't a welfare office. You're managing a fucking fast-food joint. Think you're better than me? Fuck you, I'm a miner. That fucking big truck out there, it's mine. Wow, I could've been his boss. -You're fucking arrogant. -Sure, buddy. Put a few burgers up your ass, that'll open up your mind! Fuck! I should've crushed him. Who does he fucking think he is, working in a lousy fast-food joint. He acted tough, but he was shitting his pants. Shut up! You're fucking too much. You defend me everywhere because I'm too fucking handicapped to... You call me from the mine to remind me that me... no. You talk to me about your girlfriend to remind me that I don't have any... anymore. I can't fuck anymore. All the girls see is a fucking retard. What a good friend. Okay, go. What are you doing tonight? Andrée's off tomorrow, so we thought we'd have supper together. Okay. But I can rearrange things, she'd understand. No. What would you like to do? I can cancel with Andréanne. It's okay Max. Call me if you change your mind. Maxime. Babe? Andrée? Andréanne? You alright? What happened? The clot in the toilet. I think it's the baby. We said it would be our last in vitro. I'd like to try again. Seriously? I can't, my body won't take it anymore. And I can't handle any more miscarriages. -We can still do it. -No, not me. I really need a break now. There's another option. You know it. C'mon, Max. Why won't you even talk about it? Me, I could make you a million fucking babies if I wanted to. Well, fuck. What are you doing? Maxime! Maxime Bérubé! Max! We went to the beach. Then we went to a restaurant. Who is this girl, anyway? Sarah. Fuck, Sarah who? Touzin. Oh, fuck. Hey, Gaétan... Ah, shit. Gaétan, did you know you got a new son-in-law? What? Your Sarah's got a new boyfriend, did you know that? Yeah, who's that? Grandpa, here's your new son-in-law. -So, you're the one. -Yup. Shit, he's not gonna do her no harm! Don't be shy, say hello to your dad-in-law. Fuck you, Marc-Antoine! Hey, Gaétan, a word for Julien's birthday. Hey Julien! We think about you a lot. -We all hope you get better soon. -Yes sir. Okay Gaétan, for our buddy Julien's birthday, how much are you donating to the Brain Trauma Foundation? I've got $60. -Is that enough? -We'll take what we can get. -See you, Julien! -And you, dad? Here, take it all. Good luck! Put this on. Let's go see the boss man. -Hey buddy, which one you want? -Take the brown one. Which one? Highball! Hey, François. Look who's here. Cheers Julien, happy to see you. -Here put this on. -No, I hate hats. Have a fucking happy birthday Julien! Can't wait to see you back at the mine. Everybody say bye to Julien. Happy birthday, Julien! It's crazy how much cash we got. Happy b-day, Juju! I'll count it up and text you, okay? Make it rain. You bet, make it fucking rain. -Bye. -See you, buddy. Dammit. You met your new son-in-law in the showers yesterday? -He's supposed to be a good kid. -Yeah, sure. I talk with my girl often, but she never told me. I did notice a little glint in her eyes, though. Gaétan, if it's not too personal, your girl's adopted? Yeah, why? I'm not saying it's a bad thing, just... You and your wife, you couldn't make babies? No, it wasn't working on my end. Okay. Okay. Why, you got a problem with that? I'm just saying, it must be fucking weird to not be able to make any. That's all I mean. Max, is this necessary? Fucking calm down, it's just a question. Well, that's life. We make do with what we've got. Well, yeah, sure. But you know, my little girl wouldn't have had such a good life if we hadn't adopted her. Wait. Okay. Fucking shit. Fuck. C'mon. God damn it! Fucking jammed. I'll go get it. Let's see. I forgot I had that. Found it in my bag. It'll get better for him. -It'll get better. -Yeah. Well, good night. You alright? You? Sorry for not returning your calls. I needed some time. Do you still love me? I think so. Andrée. I'm in. You screwing with me? All of a sudden, you're... Why? How? What happened... It's as if it suited me that it wasn't working. It's hard to explain but it's like I thought that I didn't deserve, that I didn't have the right to be happy. But now... Now I'm ready. For real? For really real? Hello. How's it going? I was wondering how you're doing. You haven't called me since my birthday. Yeah, the past two weeks have been rough at the mine. Do you feel like having... C'mon fuck! A beer with me tonight? Listen, Julien, I gotta say, I'm pretty tired. You don't sound so good. You alright? Just some business to deal with. You know, if you feel like talking, I don't talk so fast but I can listen. Okay. Okay. Bye. Bye. Highball! Hi! Trying to drown your truck? -You good? -You bet. Seb, gimme another beer please. There you go. Your, uh... your girlfriend is... How's it going at home? -Yes, and the... -The kids? -It's going good. -Yeah? I might have another job at another mine in town. Not on the Jumbo, though. You worked the Jumbo? Yup, I worked the Jumbo. But I want to be closer to my family as the kids grow up. I don't want to miss that. It's still a drag. We're gonna miss you. Yeah, me too. And you, what's up with kids? Seems to me you're due. We're checking things out. In fact, we are going to have a child. -Andréanne is pregnant? -No. We decided to adopt. -Yeah? -Yup. -That's insane man. -Yup. Wow, good job. That's great! And it's a nice gesture, like Gaétan said. You bet it's a nice gesture, congratulations. Thanks man. You... Cheers man. Can you open it? Of course, I'm so sorry buddy. You'll see, having kids is crazy. It's really cheesy to say, but it's the greatest thing. To have your kid sleeping in your arms, that's... Gay. Shit. -Are we going in? -Yes. -You're hot? -Yeah, I'm going in. Let's go. Julien, you want to swim? -No. -C'mon. I'm here, I'll help you. Sit down here. Your leg. Okay. Just sit on the edge. Give me your right hand. Shit. I'm holding you. That's it, that's it. -You good? -That's it. Everything good, Julien? I even went swimming. No, no. -You were able to? -Yup. I had a floater on, but still. No, no. I've done that a few times now. Yeah? Can you do other stuff like that? Out of my way, I'll do the splits. Mario, you gotta stop tilting at windmills. We need to be happy with the little victories from now on. As time goes by, there'll be fewer of them. That's what the physio said. It's over. Someone's here. Shit. What does he want? Stay put and call Daniel. -And say what? -Tell him to come. Hi. Can I help you? Life's good, eh? Nice truck, nice woman, nice house. What more do you want, eh? Alright, what's going on? You ruined my life. -Let him be. -I didn't do anything to you. Didn't do anything to me? You took everything from me! -I'm trying hard to make up for it. -You can't give me back my son! This is going nowhere. -You stole my life. -I know, I know. I know. Mario, I can't go back. This is all I can do. Everybody drives drunk. Even you, for fuck's sake. It happened to be me behind the wheel. I can't change that. I can say I'm sorry a million times. Cry myself to sleep every night. Mario, I can't turn back time. You alright? I'm alright. I'm fine, Dad, but he's... Mario. Hey, Mario. I don't know... C'mon. I'll take you home. Give me your keys. Andrée-Anne, will you follow me? Fuck. Mario. Mario, can I help? Mario. You okay? Yeah. Ready? Come on. You two will finish loading the explosives that didn't get done last time on level 4-50. Then head to 21 and get to work there, okay? Okay, thanks. -Safety first, boys. -Yup. Mario? Mario. Today you're drilling a longhole at 4-50, in 13. Take care, because Sebastien and Marc-Antoine will be loading explosives next to you in 15, but don't worry, there's enough room between you. -Good? -Yup. And you're okay in here and up here? -Yup. -Okay, have a good day. Safety first. Aren't you in bed yet? You're not underground? Yeah, I'm going later. What's up? Gaétan texted to say that Mario's not doing so well. I figured we could bring him up and give him a day off. Yeah, he didn't look so good earlier... Thanks for letting me know. Fuck! What is it? I forgot the logger on the fucking charger. I'll go get it, I gotta take a dump anyways. Make it quick! Was that a blast? Yes. Maybe an explosion. That's not right. Send an alert down and leave the ventilation on. What level was it? You think 4-50? Call the hospital in Val-d'Or, tell them to send two ambulances. Yes, thanks. Did you hear that? Okay Catherine, you're my team leader. Daniel, you're with me until backup arrives. Have the gate closed and call in the rescue team. Okay, I'm on it. Where's the list of rescuers? My desk, top drawer. I'll call the superintendent. The mine is in a state of emergency, close the gate. I'm sending someone to the camp to get the rescuers. Okay, I'll take care of it. There was an explosion underground, we're in a state of emergency. Yes, we're getting the team together. In five? Perfect, thanks. Hi Alex, it's Catherine. There's been an incident, we're coming to get you. Is this a drill? Don't know, but there was a big bang and a shake. This is Gaétan Touzin in the safe room at 4-75. Any rescuers here? No rescuers. Alright then, I'm in charge. No, no strange odours. Nothing else abnormal. One guy heard a loud boom. Were you blasting? So, is this a drill? Not a drill. Yes, we're... Hold still for a sec. Eleven. Twelve including me. Yeah, we got Gougoune here, shit, what's your real name? Martin Brunelle. There's Eric Dostie, Marie-Hélène who? -Vaillancourt. -Marie-Hélène Vaillancourt. No, sit down after I call your name, okay? It'll be quicker. Geneviève Dubé. Martin Audet. Nicolas Saint-Jean. Is that all? Perfect. Don't leave the safe room until we call you. Okay, thanks. -I'll take it from here. -Yup, go. Gaétan, Gaétan... Fuck. Who's missing? Him. Him. Marc-Antoine, Sébastien and Mario. Shit, I knew it. Daniel. Max is coming. I don't want you to tell him who's down there, okay? Okay? -Are you with me? -Yes. It's going to be okay. It's going to be fine. Now go sit down, I want to keep an eye on you. Go on. Fuck. Fuck, it wasn't supposed to... I don't get it. It wasn't supposed to blow, I don't get it. It was more than 15 metres, Mario said it was okay. I don't get it. Stéphane, stop. Look at me. You have to do this with us. It's not your fault. Not your fault. Yeah. It'll be okay. Yeah. Okay? Yeah. -How many victims? -Five. Alright. It'll be okay. Yeah. Fuck. I have to get to the fucking manway. I can't stay here. I can't stay here. Open on three. One, two, three. Jesus Christ. The explosives may have gone off on 4-50. The whole level blew up, we're missing five guys. -Who? -Max! Two of them were loading explosives in 15. One was drilling next to them in 13. Two others were working on ventilation in 3. -Who? -Hey! -I mean... -Shut up. Thanks. If the guys loading in 15 weren't on site, they may only be hurt by the shock wave. If that's the case, we have to find them. But if they were on site, we can expect the worst. The guy next to them in 13 probably set off the blast with his drilling rig. If that happened, the drill might've fallen on him. So go straight to 15, but on the way, check out 3 and 13. Clear? -Yeah. -Let's go gang. Max. It's 02:26. We're leaving station 17-50 heading for gallery 3. Anybody remember who was on 4-50 today? I heard Sébastien was loading explosives with Marc-Antoine. Fuck. Sit down. You didn't have to fucking ask that. I just wanted to know. Well, I didn't. Isn't Marc-Antoine dating his daughter? Let's stay calm. Team 2 is on standby, ready to go down. I'll keep you posted. We're here. Gallery 3 is on the right. Over there! We're splitting into two groups. Everyone focus. -Alex, you take him. -Got it. Maxime and Bordeleau, with me. Spinal board and oxy here. Stretcher and ventilator for Alex's team. The site is secure and accessible. Starting triage. Airways are clear. -Who is it? -Don't know. Injury on his right leg. Okay, I'll take care of it. We're in 3. Two men down. Looks like they fell from their scissor lifts. I've got one victim on oxygen. He's confused. Rapid breathing. Weak pulse. No visible wounds. Alex, what's your victim's status? Unconscious. Rapid breathing, weak pulse. His right leg is wounded. Max is stabilizing him. He's on the ventilator. He's gonna throw up. Okay, my guy just threw up. I've got two code reds. I'll bring up the one who's awake Can I split up my team? Team split approved. Morin, Bordeleau, stay with him. Everyone else, we're going back up. Strap him in. Max, get the basket, we're going up. Aw, fuck. Make sure his airway is clear, then put him on the oxy. Everything okay? Is he stabilized? Ready to go. Max. Max, the basket. Max. What are you doing? Going to get the others. Aw, shit. No, no, you're coming with us. -We're going back up. -I'm not leaving anyone behind. Max, you'll put yourself in danger. We can save these two guys here. Let's get the fuck out. We just put 'em on oxygen, they'll be alright. Bring them to the safe room. Then we go get the others. No, it's load and go. Catherine, bring him up now. You're crazy. Fuck, stop wasting time! -Did you tell him? -No. -I'll stay with him then. -Max, don't do this. Stop fucking around! Fuck off. I'm going. C'mon, Max. -Run after him. -Fucking hell. Maxime just took off the other way. Team 2, let's go, let's go. Max, calm the fuck down. They're right there. Let me go! Look at me. Focus, Max. Team 2 heading for the deck. You've got a fucking problem, man. What are you thinking? We got a job to do. We know them, I saw it in my father's eyes. And they're gonna die if they don't reach the safe room. What's wrong with just going to check? This guy's alright. We could've at least gone to check! Holy fuck. Give him a chair. Water. Is there any water? Marc-Antoine isn't with you? Put him here until the ambulance arrives. One, two, three, down. -You aren't going back down. -I sure as hell am. You're staying right fucking here. You stay on the surface. Stop it. Stop now. Fuck, Catherine! Boys. Sébastien just got to safe room 4-75. Yes! D.O., are you there? Stéphane here. Work site 15 has completely exploded. Is the truck there? No truck. Sébastien told me he'd left his partner at the site to go get something with the truck. We're in a difficult situation here. It'll be hard to identify the victim. Who was his partner? Marc-Antoine. D.O., are you there? Stéphane here. We're in 13. There's a guy next to the longhole. We're checking his status. -He's unconscious -Who is it? Say it. Probably Mario. C'mon Mario, fuck. No pulse, he's not breathing. He's dead. Fuck! In his room. Julien. Did you know that Ge... Ge... my ex... -Geneviève? -Yes. Geneviève. She opened a hair place. -A hair salon? -Yup. Yup. Shit, my mum goes there and I didn't even know. I ran into her. Geneviève. And we talked about before. And man, I realized how much I've forgotten. We talked about my old grey beater. Yeah? Fuck, we had fun in that car. We'd smoke so much weed behind the cross-country ski hut. You don't remember? And her dog. Yeah, her fucking ugly dog. I had no memory of that. But it's crazy because with my father, I remember everything. The igloos. And those things, the hot-dogs after... -After soccer games. -Yup. Yup. He would tell me that I could be my own worst enemy. He'd say that? Yes. I remember his his hands, his big hands when I was little. I couldn't sleep and he'd come and stroke my back until I fell asleep. And I feel him. Even now, when I can't sleep I feel his presence. I feel him. He was a good guy, my dad. Yeah, he was a good guy. 450 and 600.
