First, finish this case… Then, let’s see. Hello sir. Come in, come in Crowd Chattering Madam, sir has called you You kept asking for a case right? A suicide case was reported last night Take it. Address is there… Listen This is just your first case. Don’t try to act smart. Multiple suicide cases are reported on a daily basis. Each and every case cannot be investigated. Identify the victim and hand over the body to the family. Song playing -Check if this key fits anywhere in the house -Ok, Madam Coming, madam! What happened? Madam, this key doesn't fit any of the doors or cupboards Umm, Okay Inform the forensics and get the post mortem done ASAP. There's a chewing gum stuck on that chair. Get that checked too. Okay madam Are you the one who witnessed it? What madam? Madam, he doesn't know Kannada … Were you the first one to witness it? No madam. The night watchman was the first one to see it. How many houses have been occupied on this floor? Madam, there are no occupants on this floor yet. However, in many of the houses, carpentry and painting work is going on… Then, who is this? is he the house owner? I don't know madam. You need to ask the security chief Collect all the footages from the surveillance camera Okay madam Collect the flat owner's details from the manager. Okay madam And you also mentioned the night watchman right ? Get him along with the security chief to the station. Okay, madam Walky talky announcement Come in He's the apartment manager Hello, madam Sit down Madam, this is the night watchman. Tell madam what happened Madam, it was around 12 at night… And, it was time for my daily rounds… As it was new moon that day .. It was although more scarier…. However, I was left with no choice, so I had to go. While I was passing by the house on the sixth floor, there was a foul smell. I knocked on the door, in order to find out what was wrong, but nobody answered. However, I opened the door with the keys I had… There was also a power cut.. So I was terrified. I switched on my torch and went inside I was taken aback to see a man hanging from the fan After witnessing it, I was so petrified that I got a fever. Even now I am sick, you can check for yourself madam. Sorry, Madam I removed the computer cable Assuming that the surveillance camera wouldn’t record anything. Assuming that the surveillance camera wouldn’t record anything. Assuming that the surveillance camera wouldn’t record anything. I spent my childhood in a colony where there only one house which had a TV Since then I was crazy about watching TV. Every Sunday at 6 P.M there was a program which was telecasted, For which everyone used to line up right from 4 P.M. No matter how hard I tried to get done with my work It would end latest only by 5:30 P.M. Even if all I wanted was to find a spot by the window, people used to shoo me away… Do you know why? Because, I was just a small boy. That's why they would shoo me away… That is when I thought, That one day, I would sit in my house, on my couch, watch TV with my legs crossed. But that never happened. Even today I sit on the floor and watch TV At this age, I only earn ₹ 10,000. With which I have to run the house, send the kids to school etc.. Tell me madam, how is it feasible? I know I have failed. In such desperate times, to turn my dream into reality I used to secretly indulge in watching TV in a few houses of the apartment. But, I did not steal a single penny from any of the houses. I swear on my children I didn't do anything madam Sir please explain them I have not done anything wrong, madam. At least you tell them, Sir… I have not done anything It's alright, come with me. I have not done anything Hold on, sir ! -Please believe me. I didn't do anything. Go, sit in that corner. Madam, in many of the houses in the apartment Painting and carpentry work is still going on The work is still in progress But, many potential buyers keep coming in to check the houses, So, we have given a set of keys to the security guards. They have the keys at all times They go on routine rounds at 6 pm to check, Then the night watchmen also go on rounds to check But, I am uncertain as to why he would indulge in such an act… Madam, it's only been 2 days since we installed the surveillance cameras. We've already handed over all those footage. If required, we can you give you the register as well. Madam, the flat owner’s details are in this file. But, he stays in Canada He bought this house 6 months ago. I don't think the guy who died here is the owner On a call Can we leave, madam? Yes, you may. This is definitely a homicide. He only must've done it. Did you not observe the chair fallen next to the body? What happened to the orchestra boys? One of the boy's father paid money and bailed them out madam. What is it? I have a doubt on the watchman from the suicide case. We have taken him under our custody. Why unnecessarily? Okay Put him in the lock up for two days and release him. Also, have you identified the body? It's happening, sir. First get that completed I'll do it, sir Did you find anything? We have analysed the body. Looks like a suicide to me. Time of death should be about 2-3 days ago. I am not sure. Will know for sure once the post mortem comes in. When will the postmortem be done? It'll be done soon We have recovered the victim’s phone and wallet and sent it to your station. Collect the owner details. We'll go check the address. Also, get the call recordings Okay, Madam Tell me, ma What do you have to do? You just have to sit in one place and report files, that is all. Who? Me?

You were asking about some guy, who took the Aadhaar cards, right? Yes. Do you know him? I don't know him. But I've seen him with Kunta Kunta? Who is he? Do you know where he is? I don't know. That dude over there might know This dude? Do you know where Kunta is? Kunta? He'll be sloshed in some bar. Why? Can you take me there? Madam, let me check if he is there. Madam, Kunta isn't there. But his drinking buddy is. Who is he? The only lone old drunkard over there.. You know Kunta, right? Not really… We just drink together. Where is Kunta now? He should be here, any minute. He'll be here. Can you call him and find out when he’ll come? He has a million phone numbers. How am I supposed to know which number to call on? What does he do? He is currently jobless. However, he wasn’t doing anything legitimate. What was he doing? Weed, Shoe-Polish, Brown-Sugar Even worse, He used to sell spiked ice cream to school kids. Is he still into it? He was just the peddler.. His Boss has stopped all such activities. So he doesn't have any job. Who's his boss? Take a wild guess… Crowd chattering in a bar Munirathna. This bar's owner. Utter another word, you'll lose your tongue. You go on. Try speaking now, I dare you. Tell me What was the boss involved in? If you open your mouth, you'll not leave this place. Tell me Dude! I don't think they get it. Let's show them. Bro You're going first this time too? Guru Brahma, Guru Devo, Guru Vishnu, Maheshwara! In everything Guru is always first, bro. Now speak -Is this where you make a lady sit? -Sir, that.. Shut up! Do you have any sense? Listen, if you want to enquire about me, ask me. I'll answer. Don't come here unnecessarily I've changed for the good. I've filed my nomination for the upcoming elections. I want to do some good to the society. This is the only bar I run. A lot of shady things goes down in other bars. Instead, you are here... He is Kunta. Ask him anything you want. You know Prashant, right? Don't you recognize him? Look, women shouldn't be here. If there's anything, I'll let you know. Now, please leave. Have a closer look .. and tell me. I ain’t going to forget your face. I will find out who Prashant is and what he does If I discover any connection between the two of you… Have you realised what you've done? I'm getting calls from another jurisdiction. You created a ruckus at some bar today! Before going to another jurisdiction for investigation Don't you have the common sense to inform their Police Station? Has the body been identified? Complete that first. You get some Adhaar cards and wander off to some bar! Brother Enough! Hey, no no. I have to get home. I've told my wife that I'll be back. She's angry that I'm not there. If I don't go home tonight, she'll kill me. Indra, I'm going to bed. Don't let your uncle drink too much. Okay. You go sleep now. I'll leave after this game. So, how's retired life treating you? What else do you expect? You tell me. Your career is just starting. I've got my first case. But? If it was a murder, there would have been a motive. But I don't understand why would someone commit suicide? Isn't it cowardice? One cannot just say that He would make everyone laugh He had everything, so why? On a personal note I knew someone He seemed to be a very happy man He spoke happily that night. But by morning he was gone. But why? Only he knows why. Only they know what's bothering them inside Their trouble might seem petty to us but it may be a big deal for them. Each person and their personalities Why? How? Who knows? Only they can understand The way you cornered me reminds me of my brother. Your father. Wasn’t he the one who taught you to play Chess? He wished to join the Military, as well? Since I was older, I joined the military first. Our mother didn't want both her sons joining the military. That's why he wasn't allowed to go. If he saw you now, he'd be very proud. No dear. I have to leave. Enough. I have to go home. Listen Whatever case comes your way, don't break your head over it. - How do you know Prashant? - Which Prashant? You have purchased an apartment with Gupta Builders, right? - Yeah! - Prashant has committed suicide in it. What? In my flat? Prashant? Oh yes. He's the agent who got me the flat. He was looking after the painting and interiors for the flat. Did Prashant work with Gupta Builders? Maybe Do you know anything else about Prashant? He got in touch when I put up a post wanting to buy a flat. During my previous visit, I purchased the flat. What happened in Kolar? I met Prashant's family, Madam. They're innocent. He's the only, working member in the family. But they don't know what kind of work he does. He sends them money every month, on time. Did you inform Prashant's family, about what happened to him? Not yet, Madam Its been 10 days since they spoke to him. They even tried reaching out, To his friend friend.. Madhu? No, Mani! They tried calling him too. But they couldn't reach him. Okay, inform Prashant's family and dispose his body. - Alright Madam. -You mentioned someone named Mani - Yes Madam. - Enquire about him Also, interrogate the painters at Gupta Builders. Okay, Madam -There's no one named Prashant working here. -Is there any other branch? If Prashant is not your employee, how can he sell your flats? I don't know, Ma'am Can you show this photo to your employees? Please check -Can you check if anyone knows him? -Okay, Madam. Ma'am I know him. Where have you seen him? How do you know him? Where have you seen him? How do you know him? I don't know him personally, But I've seen him in the office. I don't know him personally, But I've seen him in the office. Are you sure its him? I remember it clearly. When I was getting coffee, he was at the reception. He took the gum from his mouth, and tried sticking it under the seat. I got angry and shouted at him. I got angry and shouted at him. Then he threw the gum into the dustbin. The receptionist said that he had come to see the boss. But what he did was wrong, wasn't it? The Receptionist remembers it as well. Let's go ask her - Okay - Come Ma'am - Is your boss Gupta, here? - Sorry, he's not here. - When will he come? - I don't know, Madam. - Can you give his contact details? - I don't have it, Madam. Prashant's body has been disposed. But, we haven't received any information on Mani, yet. We asked Prashant's parents about Mani. They claim to have never seen him. But they've spoken to him over Phone. Try harder, Kiran. We'll find something. Also, those Painters? Have you enquired with them? They've only painted one layer. Prashant had asked them to come and paint the next layer. I called the house owner, where Prashant committed suicide. He says that Prashant got him the house But Prashant's name isn't there on Gupta Builder's employee list. But, Prashant has met Mr. Gupta. And that, I don't understand why And we're not getting any further information about Gupta. We must find this. I'll Inform the inspector. Ok madam Has the body been disposed? All the formalities have been taken care of. You can leave now. Sir, the thing is... I need permission to meet Mr.Gupta, the owner of Gupta Builders. Why do you want to meet him? Sir, Prashant has met Mr Gupta. If we meet him, we'll get some clarity Is Mr.Gupta the only person Prashant has met? He meets thousands of people. Tell me, why do you have to meet him in specific? True, sir. As far as we know, Mr Gupta is the only who Prashant met if we meet him once, all the confusion will be cleared, sir. Look, these real-estate Businessmen, have contacts, with influential politicians. Tomorrow if something goes wrong, I don't want, to be blamed. You may leave now Please wait I found out where Gupta lives. - What do you want? - I want to meet Mr. Gupta. - Who are you? - Indra from Crime Branch. Kiran, talk to him. - We might get some information. - Okay Madam. -You can go inside, Madam What are you doing? Please sit. Tell me What did want to talk about?

He is the one who had hacked phones and called you. We've given the money, to the second caller. Yeah, two people from the same gang have called. So what? If its the same gang, why is one call from a stolen phone, And the other from a hacked phone? For this reason, they've done it. You're confused aren't you? They've done it, to confuse us.

All these numbers belong to Air-Voice. What about Mrs. Gupta. Is it Air-Voice too? Yes, Madam. That's why I have been sent from Air Voice. - And their internet connection? -It's Air-Voice, Madam. The bills from these 8 houses, They're all from the house-burglary case. The network users use Air Voice. And Mrs. Gupta, does she use Air-Voice as well? Yes, Air-Voice. then.. The 2 ransom calls, made to the Guptas. from Chandigarh and Chennai. Can you please check the network connection of those numbers? The numbers are all from Air-Voice, Madam. What I'm saying right now may or may not be true. I think an employee from Air Voice, Has hacked these numbers. After hacking, He finds out the movement of the residents. And then he robs those houses. And maybe the same person hacked Mrs Gupta's phone to rob them. And I think, that's when he found out, that Mr. Gupta's daughter has been kidnapped. And then used this situation to his advantage But the actual kidnapper Did not ask for any money. Why? Maybe they're all part of the same gang, Madam. Is there anything else that's common between Mr Gupta's house and the burgled houses? Maybe the installation guy or Someone from the call center Or maybe the service engineers? No, madam. Its not possible to find out now. But I can tell you once I get to office tomorrow. Why can't we go now? Only the call centers will be open right now. We won't find any information there. Once I get to the office tomorrow, I can give you all the details. Sign here Give his clothes Hey.. Go back to your village or else all the pending cases will fall on you I guess he'll never learn -Yes, Ma -Yes, Get some milk on your way back I'll get it We've already given you 1 crore. You said you would show us our daughter But did not show her at all 1 crore? I never asked for so much money If you give me 15 lakhs, Your daughter will come back to you -Who is it? -Yes, yes. We'll give the money. Where should we come? Come to Majestic bus stand in 2 hours with the money But please, can I talk to my daughter just once. Please. Tell me, Diamond They just got another ransom call. I'll send you the recordings. Please check them. Give me 15 lakhs and take your daughter -This sounds like the first caller's voice, doesn't it? -Yes, madam Which area did the call come from? One second, I'll check, madam. -I told you its two different people -Yeah -Can you send the details I asked for quickly? -Okay madam Your daughter is right here She hasn't eaten anything all these days I don't think she has the strength to talk But, i'll give it to her If she talks to you, talk Talk to me Aishu Aishu, please talk to me Is she speaking I told you, she isn't in a condition to talk Give me the money and take her Ok, ok. We'll get the money There was a call made again from the same area. He said the girl is with him. I'll go check. Is there any accused named Mani here? I dont know madam. I'll have to check. I want the records of all the petty thieves I will take a look at it We've been calling him Kunta for so long we didn't realise his real name was Mani He just got released Here's the register You were the one who created a scene at the bar the other day, right? Have you seen Kunta? Over There Crowd chattering was someone limping and running here? He went that way Why are you laughing? Where's the girl? What did you do to her? I had got mouth cancer two years ago I used to smoke a lot So I quit smoking But now I can’t talk without a beedi in my mouth What have you done to the girl? I didn't do anything. She was here when I left a while ago I had tied her up. She didn't even have the strength to get up. How many of you are involved in this kidnap? How did you do it? I don't know how they did it. My friend Prashant kidnapped her I was just looking after her I did it because he said he’ll give me 15 lakhs once we release the girl At the bar you said you didn't know Prashant Why did he commit suicide? I don’t know I got to know about his death through the people in his home town That girl was right here I was supposed to get 15 lakhs That's why I called them You called once. Why didn't you call all these days? How could I? For someone else's crime, they put me in the jail I got released today so I thought I’d Send the girl and take the ransom. How will you send her? Where is the girl? She was right here I had tied her up. You've seen it yourself, Madam.The door was open I found Mani. He said the girl was with him. But she's not here anymore There are few blood stains in his house. Get it checked. Inform the forensics and the inspector I'll send you the location now Madam, I checked the details In 8 houses that were robbed and in Gupta's house, the WiFi was installed by the same guy And he also worked in customer care He quit his job a week ago I'll send you his photo and address. Please check them. Madam, this is the house. I asked around. They’ve gone out somewhere He is the reason for all this drama. Do you know? The girl was kidnapped by Prashant -But do you know who asked him to do it? Her father I told her about it this morning Do you know why? Because the girl kept saying that her father will come to save her I couldn't bare it So I told her the truth I dont know why he did such a thing, Madam. My apartment the same one Prashant committed suicide in In that apartment, 80% of the flats are still empty No one's buying it My money is flowing out of my hand like water But I have another huge land I wanted to sell that land And compensate for the loss incurred in this apartment Two years ago The government came up with a scheme To rejuvenate all the dried up lakes When people found out that my land also was a lake, no one wanted to buy it. Okay I thought I'll build an apartment myself But The area's MLA and the BBMP officials Didn't give me the permission to build I tried really hard They asked for 50% of the projects value as commission to grant permission How will I give? I used my political influence as well And then I had a thought What if I become the MLA? But people don't know who I am They know my company Gupta Builders But they don't know me. They don't recognise my face. I've done a lot of charity work -social service, donated books to children. I've done it all But that wasn't enough for people to sympathise with me. The media should find out in 2 days Newspapers will report it TV channels will talk about it After that, my daughter Aishu will come back to me After she comes back everyone will question as to who did it My name shouldn't come up at any cost You surrender Confess that you did it And if they ask why you did it Tell that MLA Shivakumar asked you to do it Sir, you betrayed me If I go to the prison, will you get me out? I know you very well Imagine. My photos will be everywhere and world will call me a criminal Not only that People will talk about it to my parents What have they done, sir? If I accuse the MLA for the kidnapping, Would he spare me? I'm already a dead man Then why should I live ? And that’s why I am going to die, Try to find your daughter if you can. Hello madam, we checked the blood samples, It is matching with Aishwarya’s blood group It'll take some time to get the DNA reports But the inspector got the news He's on his way to Gupta's house Ok madam We found the place where your daughter was kept. But she's not there anymore Only her blood stains are there For a little bit of fame and money, you kidnapped your own daughter? Madam, I doubt this is our guy. He looks innocent. I doubt he has 1 crore with him. Come in Please, come in Sorry, this is my daughter's work Just out of curiosity, how did you figure it out? 8 houses burglary I was the service engineer for all the 8 houses I didn't know the police were so smart to solve it Forget that. What would you like to drink? Coffee? Tea? It's not very difficult to make money Think a little out of the box Do you have any idea how helpless a man is when he has no money? That's why I decided. I started stealing. But who did I steal from? They're all poisonous demons When they breathe, there's only drought Each one of them is Vritrasura (God of drought) You may not see it But when you see from my perspective, you'll understand Its not a dragon, Ma. It's a demon called Vrithra It was me He is a demon who kidnaps his own daughter for fame and power. What's wrong if I steal from him? Who benefits from all of this? When you were waiting outside my house there was a delivery boy there Did you notice? 7th cross builders house robbery That money got him the bike And that bike got him a job and the job settled his life And someone else got a tailoring machine In someone's house there was a baby shower There was no tension I went to get back my wife’s gold which we had mortgaged But I couldn't. She would be very happy if she’d got the jewellery back But if she asks me where I got the money from What would I say? He's not the guy I had told you, Madam You can leave. I'll go by cab. Ma, since childhood I've always wanted to learn new things solve crime cases, catch criminals And to pursue that I joined the crime branch But I learnt one thing to solve cases and catch criminals Hey, hey don't jump to any conclusions. I don't even know who this girl is. Just like hacking everyone else's phone, I hacked her mom's phone too That's when I found out she had been kidnapped Then I got an idea I found a way to make money You were the one who got me 1 crore rupees i might look like a criminal from your perspective But I have conscience too I started to worry about what happened to this girl Just like how you worked hard to find this girl, I too worked hard to find her I found the girl two hours before you did My dad never restricted me And I never disobeyed him In fact, I studied abroad for my masters to support him in his business. Lie Everything was a lie My wounded heart can never be healed impossible I want to find myself I want to live my life on my terms The money is here, I'm also here You did all of this for your selfish motives and now you are preaching about moral high grounds? Haven't you ever felt what you did was wrong? What's right? What's wrong? Selfishness is in human nature When a mother feeds her child Its because of the selfishness to see the child smile There's nothing without selfishness here But the only difference is Some people’s selfish motives does good but some people’s selfish motives destroys everything. If people benefit out of my selfishness I can do whatever it takes I don't have the habit of feeling guilty unnecessarily. I did what I felt was right You do what you feel is right. You said you don't have the habit of feeling guilty. Then why are you explaining yourself so much? You should know what you've done is right or wrong What have you done to Gupta? He's gone mad I didn't take any money from him He's not in a condition to talk This is just for your reference, Sir I've already sent a copy to the commissioner's office What is this? Have you gone crazy? Just because you can't handle a case, you're resigning? You are being immature. Don't you know how hard it is to get a job here? You should make use of the opportunities you get. But you...
