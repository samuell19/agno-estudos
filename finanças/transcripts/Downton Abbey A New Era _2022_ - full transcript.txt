A Mr. Murray will be here soon. H-He's here now, milady. He... he says you're expecting him. What? Why didn't you tell me? You shouldn't be so untrusting. Ah, have you told them, Lady Grantham? Good. Please. She's told us nothing. Well, that's easily done. I've come into possession of a villa in the south of France. And now I've given it to my great-granddaughter Sybbie. What? What bit didn't you understand? I don't understand any of it. What villa? Where? This is too extraordinary for any words. It's called La Villa des Colombes, and it's near Toulon. But why was it yours? And why have you never said anything about it? Because I thought it was a joke. - Start at the beginning. - (Mary sighs) Years ago, before you were born, I was in France, and I met a man, the Marquis de Montmirail. And he invited me to spend some time at a villa he'd just bought. A year or so later, he wrote to me and said he'd transferred the villa into my name. I never thought he was serious, so I didn't pay any attention. - But it wasn't a joke? - MURRAY: It seems not. He died recently, and to his widow's alarm, the villa they've been using every winter for years was registered to Lady Grantham. He never changed it. - Now, I'll need some signatures. - Oh, yes. Why have you given it to Sybbie? Your children are well set up here, and Edith's are more than taken care of, but Brompton will go to a child of Tom and Lucy's. So darling Sybil's only daughter will inherit little, and I wanted to correct that. What family did he have, uh, this M-Montmirail chap? The widow and a son, the present marquis. The mother is keen they should take the matter to court. - Well, you can't blame her. - VIOLET: Why? If her husband wanted me to have the place, who are we to argue? You never thought to turn it down? Do I look as if I'd turn down a villa in the south of France? Mr. Murray? - May I ask a favor? - Please. I have a task for you. It's all explained in this letter. I'll telephone in a few days in case there are questions. Of course, Lady Grantham. - Now, I hear my train calling. - Goodbye, Mr. Murray. And thank you. You want me to tell you why he did it when the truth is I do not know. (door opens) And with that, I will say good night and leave you to discuss my mysterious past. Now, Denker, don't steer me. I'm not a racing car. More's the pity. I beg your pardon. You really must try... It does seem odd. They spend a few days together in the same resort more than 60 years ago, and he gives her a house. I suppose he wasn't just a lunatic. Well, that's what they'll try to prove. Well, I think it's marvelous of Granny to take care of Sybbie. Even if Monsieur de Montmirail was as mad as a rat. But why did Mama never say a word? ROBERT: As far as she's concerned, she received a very eccentric letter more than half a century ago, she considered it potty at the time and never gave it another thought.

What's the point? BERTIE: Well, I suppose there'd be a fee. ROSAMUND: When does Henry get home? MARY: Not in time for this. Where is he now? His last message was from Istanbul or somewhere. But as far as I'm concerned, the whole idea of a rally is barmy. You can manage it without him. I see. So it's down to me, is it? You can't expect us to deal with kinema people. First, let's just listen to his proposal. - CORA: Hmm. - Come along, Mary. I'll keep you company. The money would be useful, surely. EDITH: Is everything all right with Henry? He's in love with cars. He's in love with speed. He's in love with adventure. He's also in love with me, I think. But I don't seem to cancel out the other three. And you thought you would? I suppose I did. NANNY: Ready for you. (laughing) (engine rumbling) ♪ ♪ BARBER: It's perfect. Until recently, filmmaking was largely confined to the studios, but now the process has opened up. Abel Gance's Napoléon last year showed what a camera can do on location, filming in real houses, real landscapes. What sort of film is it? The Gambler is set in 1875. Uh, an earl's daughter, Lady Anne Erskine, falls in love with a man who turns out to be a gambler, to her family's horror. I can imagine. They meet at a house party in the country, and things soon spin out of control. There are visits to a smart gambling club, which we'd do here. A gambling club at Downton? That would finish Granny off. And Papa, too. - We must have time to think. - Of course. Here's my card. - Mm-hmm. - Ring me if you have any questions at all. I'll get Barrow to see you out. I suppose there are two questions that we would need the answer to before we can really have the discussion. Uh, we'd be here for about a month, and if you turn the card over, you'll see what we'd pay. Of course, that's negotiable. - MARY: Goodbye, Mr. Barber. - EDITH: Goodbye. And that's the starting point? (thunder rumbling) ROBERT: I think it's a horrible idea. Actresses plastered in makeup and actors just plastered, scrambling over our things. We'd have to keep counting the spoons in the pantry. The locals might take a dim view. Well, you mustn't let that stop you. The county takes a dim view of everything. You have to consider the fee. We don't need to talk about money. EDITH: Oh, but you need to think about it. You could have a new roof, for a start. You could soon be looking at real flooding, and then what? If you turn them down, do you think we could persuade them to drive further north to Brancaster? (scattered laughter) Mama, where do you stand? Mary, dear, will you take your father to see the attics? I don't think he's been there for quite a while. (thunder rumbling softly) I haven't been up here for years. Well, this is the situation we're in. With the money, we can bring the house up to snuff, to match what we've spent on the estate and enter the 1930s with our heads held high. - But if you don't want to... - No. No, you steer ahead. You're the captain now. I am aware of that, even if you think I'm not. - (light laughter) - (Mrs. Hughes sighs) And now I have the unenviable task of breaking the news to Mr. Carson. DAISY: I can't believe it. To make a film here? Can they do that? Would there be film stars? Famous ones? Oh, give her some water before she passes out. Nothing's decided yet. MRS. PATMORE: It's all very fine to get excited. You live at the farm. The rest of us will have them in and out and round about every hour God sends. DENKER: And what of Her Ladyship? - Hoping for a peaceful end... - Mm. ...and suddenly plunged into a three-ring circus. Well, I agree with Daisy. We'll get to know men and women we've only seen upon the silver screen. - And if it's good for the house... - This is the point. An injection of cash could make all the difference. They mention how much? It's not our business if they did. - They did not. - Well, good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night, Mrs. Hughes. Still, times change and we must change with them. Mrs. Parker. We should be getting home, too. Very good, Mr. Parker. I'm coming. (Mrs. Patmore chuckles) Daisy's more obedient with him than she ever was with me. Maybe he makes her happier. Well, I did me best. CARSON: A moving picture? At Downton? I know it sounds unlikely, but I'm not sure it's quite as awful as that. I disagree. Rough and vulgar actors and actresses strolling through the rooms with their sticky fingers, sitting on the chairs, eating at the table where the King of England once sat? Oh, this smacks of the worst excesses of the French Revolution. Should we ask them to stay standing and put them in gloves? This is a comedown, Elsie. This is a falling-off. They are flirting with mob rule. But it will pay, Charlie, and they need the money. Oh, by that argument, why not open the place to the public and have them poke and pry in every corner? We tried that once, and I thought we'd all decided never again. You carry on like that, you'll give yourself a heart attack. I'd be better off out of it if this is what we've come to.

I'm bound to in the end, and then where will we be? Murray's had the will translated. Apparently, Montmirail refers to an idyllic interlude he spent with Mama as a young man before he was married. What else did Murray have to say? Why, it's odd. The widow wants to fight the will, but the son believes it can be settled in a friendly way. I'd cover the villa with barbed wire and board up the windows. (chuckles) He says he'd like us to visit him there. Now, clearly Mama can't travel, but he asked us to bring Tom and Lucy with us now that he knows Sybbie is to be the beneficiary. What do you think? Well, we could get to know Lucy better. And with any luck, it would mean we'd miss the whole of Mary's frightful film. I found it. Myrna Dalgleish. I knew I had a good one of her. Her beauty is so classic. I've got one of him. Guy Dexter in Casanova. The very thought of it makes me blush. There is something about him. Like a wild animal ready to spring. Ready to spring on you, you mean. - (gasps) - BATES: That's enough. You'll have Andy and me jealous if you don't watch out. Oh, I like the sound of that. (chuckles) I hate that you'll miss all the fun. I'm nervous now, leaving you alone with Guy Dexter. The chance would be a fine thing. (laughs) - MARY: What do you think, Bertie? - CORA: A complication. Tom says they'd have to bring Maud Bagshaw. She's living with them until her house is ready. We can all stay in an hotel. In that case, can we come? I'd love it. We wouldn't be in the way? So everyone's going except me? And me.

Well, I'm glad to hear you're doing something with your brain again. Well, let's hope it's still there. ROBERT: I'll telephone Montmirail tomorrow and explain we'll be in an hotel. I should think he'll be relieved. (quiet knocking) Come in. - I saw the light was still on. - (chuckles) I suppose you agree with Papa that the whole idea of a film is too common to even be considered. Nothing is too common if it will help to keep Downton afloat. Well, we'd have enough money for a new roof. At the cost of one terrible month. Honestly, I do think it will be pretty terrible. But the sight of old washbasins catching rainwater in the attics is terrible, too. We got through the war. We can get through this. But you must be firm, Mary.

That's the Duke of Westminster's yacht. ♪ ♪ Let me sum up. In the years since 1864, the late Marquis de Montmirail made four wills. In every one, he refers to the fact that he gave the Villa des Colombes to the now Dowager Countess of Grantham in 1865. I brought the originals. I will leave copies. Then clearly it wasn't something that slipped his mind. He meant to do this thing, and he stuck by his decision. I feel better for that. MME DE MONTMIRAIL: She must have had some hold over him. She must have blackmailed him. Maman, this is a foolish response. We shall challenge it in court. GANNAY: On what basis, madame? You have other houses. There's no question of hardship. Your husband bought the villa and disposed of it before he even met you. My advice would be to surrender the property without delay. (scoffs) Thank you so much. - Do you mean to accept this? - Of course. My father made me sole executor, Lord Grantham. I like to think it was because he trusted me to carry out his wishes. Then why did you invite us here? Because I was curious to meet you. My father and your mother spent a week together in October 1864. And I was born in July 1865. Precisely. I think that's the key to why he gave her the villa one month later. In gratitude for your birth. In short, I believe you and I have a great deal in common. - (both laughing) - (seabirds screeching) - We should thank old Lady Grantham. - Of course. At least now we know that for her to have the villa wasn't a random choice or a foolish mistake but a decision that was firmly endorsed over many years. Feels funny, in a way, to know my own child is part of this golden circle where, because of your blood, lovely things happen. Just as Mary will have Downton and we will have Brompton. Yes, but they're working estates. This place was made for laughter and fun. Wouldn't Sybil have been pleased for her daughter? And encouraged her to use it for the good of others? Yes, I think she would. Then let's do the same. I long to bring Sybbie here. She'll love it. (sighs) Look at that view. Don't you feel grateful we're alive? I love you, you know. In a way I thought I'd never love again. And I love you. So that's all right. TOM: Shall we go back in? The water is... CORA: They look very happy together. - So they should. - EDITH: Mm. It's thrilling for Sybbie, for all of them. I like the idea of Tom and Lucy hosting a gathering here every summer, until it becomes a family tradition. (sighs) The sun has made me sleepy. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll have a nap before dinner. You look a little tired, too. Why don't you do the same? I won't be too long. She's right. You do look tired. Never sure how helpful it is for people to point it out. Oh, I'm sorry. Keep writing, whatever happens. Mama, if something is troubling you, please just say it. No, no, it's nothing, honestly. - (crickets chirping) - CARSON: I've had to change the setting of the dinner table again, but I think they've got the hang of ironing His Lordship's shirts at last. You should've let me do that. They must be very grateful for your help, Mr. Carson. CARSON: Well, maybe. When I showed them how to do it, they certainly spoke a lot of French very loud and very fast. Is anything settled yet? It seems the villa now belongs to Miss Sybbie. Lucky girl. Do you envy her, Miss Baxter? I'm not a big believer in envy, Mr. Bates. I know what I want, and I can live without a villa in the south of France. What do you want, Miss Baxter? Oh, come now, Mr. Carson. We all know what Miss Baxter wants. Her affections are very firmly engaged. Not engaged. Not engaged in that way, perhaps, but thoroughly taken. Are we discussing Mr. Molesley? We are. But suppose he never steps up to the mark? Then I will be a spinster. You'd never marry anyone else? (chuckles softly) It took me long enough to find him. Madame. I don't know how long he's thought about it, but once he checked the dates, he was sure. I was born exactly nine months after-- and I quote-- the "idyllic interlude" they spent together. And he gave her the villa soon after I was born. I'm sure that's all coincidence. Are you? It would explain the mystery. Your father loved you very much. - But Rosamund's the one who looks like him. - (knocking) I hope this helps, milady. CORA: Thank you, Baxter. - Good night. - Good night. What's that for?

I expect, when she got home, your grandpapa was jolly pleased to see her. - (Bertie and Lucy laugh) - Anyway, what's clear is Monsieur de Montmirail was madly in love with her. - When did he marry? - BERTIE: Oh, I know that. I looked him up. He married in 1870, five years after Robert was born. And the present marquis arrived in 1873. So the villa was a sort of parting gift to your grandmother before he looked around for a wife. That's what it sounds like. Evidently. DAISY: I'm gonna sound him out. - About Mrs. Patmore. - You can't. I can. You know she's got a house of her own. You know she's lonely. It's a solution for all of us. You look very conspiratorial. We were talking about Mrs. Patmore and how much she likes you. Does she indeed? Well, I like her. - She's a fine woman. - She is. But I worry sometimes that she's lonely. She's got her own cottage, of course, but I think she'd like some company in it. (chuckles) I know what you're thinking, but the answer's no. You've always said you admired her. And so I do. But I couldn't live off a woman. It wouldn't be right. - Even if she wanted it? - Even then. There are things that are right and there are things that are wrong, and I can't change that. Thank you for taking it on. I owe you a great deal. Is everything in order? Well, (sighs) once we've recorded sound for the scenes we've already shot, we'll need new material for what's left... MOLESLEY: Ooh. M-May I have a word, Mr. Barber? Of course. I-I've been through all the dialogue cards that w-would've been shown if the picture were silent, and I've started to sketch out scenes that would cover the needs of the plot. You mean you've written a play? Well, I've started one. - Could I read these scenes? - Of course. And if you're content, I'll do the rest. Am I bound by the plot synopsis? For instance, when she finally casts him off, might it not be better with a big romantic climax? I don't understand. Well, Bill Benson's about to throw away his life on the tables. Alone, hollow and without hope. Then suddenly he lifts his face and sees Anne standing there, tall, serene, graceful, her eyes shining with unshed tears. On an impulse, he snatches back his money. Rien ne va plus! The wheel spins. (whooshing) (imitates roulette wheel clicking to a stop) And every last thing he owns would have gone. But no. Her love, her beauty have saved him. She takes his hand, and they walk away. Together. The end. I think I'm going to cry. Mr. Molesley, please finish the script however you think best and bring it to me. Right. - You say he used to work here? - MARY: Yes. He was a footman. But we weren't aware of his hidden talents. (insects chirring) MAUD: Poor Carson. He must be cooking in those heavy clothes. Isn't there a lighter version he could wear? - I believe so. - Thank you, monsieur, but we English are never too hot to wear the correct attire.

You needed it. And then love came. And we have been happy, haven't we? (whispers): Oh, darling. You have been everything to me. Everything. And I hope I can be everything for a while yet. Now... - ...we must make an early start tomorrow, - Oh. and it's hours past my bedtime. (chuckles) (chuckles): Oh, dear. Hope we can still get tickets on the Blue Train. ROBERT: Oh, yes. (jazz music continues) - (music ends) - (birds chirping) (quiet chatter) Why is the camera in a padded cell? Anyone would think it was a lunatic. Well, it's certainly unpredictable. The microphone must not pick up any noise - unless I have approved it. - Mm. The padded box contains the sound of the camera working. So we're really in your hands now, Mr. Stubbins. Your words, not mine. Everyone ready? Let's go for a take. And... STUBBINS: Uh, please be aware of where the microphones are and speak clearly. And, uh, this time, Myrna, mime but don't talk. - Not a word. Do you understand? - I'm not stupid. We only want to hear Lady Mary. Mary, please. Very good. Uh, Albert, you ready with the clapstick?

I'm sorry. - Right, that's it. - I've had enough. - Myrna. You take your hands off me. - Get out of my way! - Myrna, darling! No! Now what? I knew she'd be trouble right from the start. She's rude. She's surly. ANNA: True, but now she also feels humiliated. Moving her mouth while Lady Mary's voice comes out of it. MRS. PATMORE: And this is her first sound film. What happens to her next? MRS. HUGHES: I suppose her career's finished. I suppose a lot of them are finished. The point is they've got to get her back to work. But what if she won't come? They can't force her. Why don't you two have a go? You know how to reason with her. They don't. (Anna sighs) Myrna, darling, please come down. We can't do anything without you. You can talk without me! Just go away! Milady. I think it would be a good idea to let the maids see if they can make her comfortable, Mr. Barber. All right. If you think so, yeah. Stand back, everybody. (knocking) Please let us in, Miss Dalgleish. We understand what you're going through. That's true, and you know it. (lock clicks) I'm not going down just so they can humiliate me - and laugh at me. - They won't do that. Oh? You should've heard them at every premiere. "Don't speak. Don't open your mouth." They despise me. Why didn't you take elocution lessons? Lots of people do. I tried. I couldn't get it. Couldn't get the knack. Something's upset you since the day you got here. - What is it? - It's this. I knew I was finished the moment I saw The Jazz Singer. It's been like a sword hanging over me. I thought maybe I had a few more films ahead of me, but this one will be me last. You don't know that. You look good in the bits I've seen. And how do I sound, eh? But the fact is I'm washed up, as the Yanks say. I'm yesterday's news. (Myrna sighs) Come on, lady. You're not talking to your fan club now. What? You're famous, beautiful and rich. So what if your film career is over? There's any number of things you can do. Now, dust yourself off. And while you're at it, try being polite - to the people who serve you. - Come on, Daisy. You're one of us, not one of them. Just remember it. Now, chop-chop. Straighten your hair, and let's get going. (knocking) How you doing in there? DAISY: She's almost ready, Mr. Barber. You are, aren't you, Miss Dalgleish? I had a sister just like you once. I miss her. Every day. You remind me of her. She died of the Spanish flu in 1919. Didn't think it would touch our family, but you never know, do you? (inhales deeply) Shall we go? (Myrna sighs) I'm not worth it. MARY: You're worth it to me. Rien ne va plus.

Watching you, it took me back to the plays you three used to put on in the attic. Except there's rather more riding on it this time. I don't mean to be harsh, but how do we know she's any good? Oh, she's absolutely superb. I showed Granny Papa's telegram, Tom, but you ought to look in. Perhaps we should go up now. Maybe you're right. It ought to be you.

Death by microphone, eh, Guy? Our business has always been a game of chance. Well said. I have an idea, Miss Dalgleish, which might just help. I'm taking your mama to the hospital first thing in the morning. I'm dreading it, of course. But that's for you to hear, not her. I thought they might put up more of a fight. So did we. The mother wanted to. And then Edith found this. It's inscribed to you on the side. Oh. ♪ ♪ (chuckles) I...

I think we got on pretty well in the end, don't you? I think we did. In the end. You weren't quite what we had in mind for Sybil, but we got past it. And that's life, isn't it? Getting past the unexpected. And perhaps learning from it, which I think we can say we've done. You've been a good friend to me through the years, Violet. I hope I've been a friend to you. And now you're settled. Maud's back in the family, and everyone's happy. When was the miniature painted? Did you sit for it? No, we... we went for a walk in the town one day, and there was a shop where a man was taking photographs. Yeah, I remember 'cause he was the first photographer I'd ever seen. They must have copied it from that. Montmirail sent it to me in London with a silly scribbled letter. I sent it back. Of course, I should have burned it. We'll leave you to rest. But we wanted to say how very grateful we are. And Sybbie will be, too. It's a beautiful place. That I do remember. (door opens, closes) (sighs) Time for bed. Yes, I'll just tidy these up. What are they? The letters of Monsieur de Montmirail. Oh. They're clearly labeled? (chuckles) I'm afraid so. (chuckles) So she was lying when she said she remembers nothing. "Lying" is a harsh word.

What would they say? I don't care. I've lived in America for ten years now. I don't believe in that stuff anymore. Please, call me Guy. What's your real name? Quentin. Quentin Sidebotham. That was a good decision. (Guy chuckles) Do you know what you're doing next? I don't think anybody does. I shall go home and await developments.

You'd run the house and organize our journeys, make me comfortable. Make us both comfortable. Of course, if my career folds, then we'd have to think again, but... Your career won't fold. Good. Well... You let me know when you've... come to a decision. (typewriter clacking) (door closes) Right. I have everything I need. I will come up to the house with the results as soon as I have them.

But even if everything is as bad as it could be, there's still a surgery. Let's take it one step at a time. Oh, God. Robert doesn't see it, but things could be a lot worse. How many have to face this kind of thing feeling they've wasted their lives? I don't. Not at all. How are things at the farm? Cramped. Poor Mr. Mason. He'd be so unhappy to hear you say it. He's been talking about you lately. Oh, yes? Saying what a fine woman you are and how much he admires you. Does he? Really? But he won't take it any further. Why not? Because he can't ask you to live at the farm and he couldn't be dependent on a woman. Oh, couldn't he? We'll see about that. Look what we've found. When I was going through Violet's things. "The letters of the Marquis de Montmirail." EDITH: Oh, dear. It doesn't look good for Papa if she felt the need to keep it a secret. Well, let's not jump the gun. Oh, I'm so sorry. Are you in the middle of something? No, no. Could I speak to you alone for a moment, please? Yes. So what happens now? Well, I thought we could read them together. Bertie, you and I can do it and report back what they contain. And we'll break the news to Papa. (Barber clears throat) What is it? You have to help me. We're just about to film our last set piece, the-the dinner when Benson realizes he must give her up and rushes off to London. I know. I've just been learning it. Molesley's done a wonderful job. I told you the extras were fed up with not being paid, and I don't blame them, but I'm still waiting for the money. Well, they won't do anything too drastic. Won't they? They say they're not coming into work. But how can I help? Could your servants stand in? You're welcome to ask them. (chuckles) Is there something else, Mr. Barber? I could never have got through any of this without you. If that's true, then I'm glad. (sighs) May I kiss you? No. Don't you want to? I'm afraid I'm too old-fashioned to believe that what I want is the only thing that matters. - Have I offended you? - Not at all. Nothing is nicer for an old married woman than to find she's still an object of desire. (chuckles) Well, you better not tell your husband when he gets back. He might, uh, hit me on the nose. Mm, wouldn't that be thrilling? Two gorgeous men fighting for my favors. (knocking, door opens) You rang, milady? - So she'd kept his letters? - Seemingly. Every one. I won't ask what she had to hide, in case you tell me the answer. Well, most of them are rather sad. There was clearly no love lost between him and his wife. But what do they tell us about the days they spent together in France? I'm afraid that they didn't write to each other then. So we still have no proof of what really happened. BERTIE: I suppose that is where the mystery resides. I'll come and see Violet tomorrow. (sighs) Should I do it? No. You're what the lawyers call "an interested party." I'm not. You mean we'd be up there on the screen with Miss Dalgleish and Mr. Dexter? - (chuckles) Are you sure? - (excited murmuring) - That's exactly what I mean. - Well, I'll do it. Mm, so will Mr. Carson. (excited chatter) Mr. Molesley will want to join in. - How many do you need? - BARBER: Uh, we need ten. Miss Denker, are you up for it? Certainly not. I want to keep an eye on Her Ladyship. - What about Mr. Mason? - I could always ask. No, hurry to the farm and ask him now. And they've got costumes for us? BARBER: Oh, well, they'll need time to fit them, so you should go upstairs to wardrobe - before the end of the day. - (chatter, laughter) What about servants? - Who's going to wait on us? - (laughter) Well, I was thinking we could use Albert. - (gasping) - Would I be serving Miss Dalgleish? - I suppose so. - Oh, well... - (excited chatter) - Right, let's get back to work, please! - All right, come on now. - Come along. ISOBEL: Filming must be the slowest occupation known to man. It makes a glacier look impatient. I suppose Robert's in hell. He was longing for it all to be over by the time they got back. You could ease his pain if you wish. We found the letters of Monsieur de Montmirail. But Robert still doesn't have the answer he needs. I won't pretend not to understand you. Did they tell you about the miniature? What's its significance? Well, could you fetch it? It's in the bottom right-hand drawer. If you open it at the back, you'll find the letter he sent with it. It's still there after all this time. Could you read it? "Chère Violette, we have missed the chance "to know perfect love. But we still can if you would only change your mind." Why didn't you just tell us? There was nothing to tell. Nothing happened. Apart from years of being pestered. Well, no. That's not quite right. Then what is? I never saw him after that. I knew I'd have given in. If I'd been tested again, I would have failed. Oh. I was a fool for love in those days. A few years later, we went to Russia, and I got into terrible trouble. Well, I nearly did. With Prince Kuragin. Yes, I know. How did you avoid it with the marquis? I can't think. He was the most attractive man I'd ever met in my life. (chuckles) But I hadn't long been married, and it must have seemed a shame, you know, to spoil that. I wish you'd said all this. I didn't want you to think my life had been a fraud, when it hasn't. I was happy with Robert's father. Well, (chuckles) happy enough in that English way, when you never talk about anything but you trust each other. If they'd put Kuragin and Montmirail together, I would have come out as some sort of scarlet woman. (chuckles) You don't seem very scarlet to me. Well, I'm trusting you to make sure that's not how I'm remembered. Well, the next earl will be Matthew's son, my grandson, your great-grandson. I'll do my best to see he values you. I know you will. I know I can trust you to do the right thing. That's very generous of you. Well, because we've had our tussles, you and I. Well, it's true, but I'm glad you came to Downton. I'd never known anyone whose opinion I could trust, you know, to be morally right, not for years. Well, not since my mother died. You must have wondered why I asked you to go through my papers. I did rather. When I think about that world of long ago, when I... I was a girl in my first crinoline... ...in those moments, I feel as if I've been transported to a different planet.

Why do you think he gave you the villa if it has nothing to do with my birth? I think it had everything to do with your birth.
