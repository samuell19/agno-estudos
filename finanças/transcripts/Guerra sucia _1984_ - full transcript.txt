Apart from the fact that one of the company engineers will be giving us a hand. Okay, where do I come in? You'll enter the building 12 hours before the others. You and the gentleman I spoke of, the engineer, will deactivate the alarm system and open the safe. What if that engineer of yours doesn't cooperate? Then you'll have to deal with him, of course. When you have deactivated the alarm, Kurt and the others will join you. If he doesn't get flattened by a girl. Why don't you tell him what happened in Munich, Kurt?
