- Do it. - All right. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. How did you do that, bro? Charlie. The Mexican demon named Charlie. A Mexican demon named Charlie? - Yes. - You mean Carlos? Oh. What, Vic? Come on, bro. Busted, man. Come on, man. It's just a game. It's a stupid game, jeez. Sad! What do you have to say for yourself? You guys wanna try something with a little more kick? Like what? You can thank my dear cousin for this hookup. What's that? No, man. This thing first killed a kid in the '90s - named Charlie Grimille. - Oh. - Grimille, right? - Yeah. And after that, his spirit started popping up everywhere. - I'm gonna like this. - Yeah. So, the real Charlie challenge is... Okay, wait, wait. We're going live. Okay. "The year is 1710." And yet, if I knew it was the last year "of the life which is mine..." "I am but a lowly peasant..." and I, too, long for something more. More than the life my mother gave me. "She bestowed upon me the name August Benjamin Rutherford." Whoa. Vic, how are you doing that? Whoa. It is scary. - I ain't doing it, guys. - Victor, man, come on. What do you mean you're not doing that? - What are you doing? - What do you mean no one... Whoa. - Marcus? - That that Charlie thing? Marcus is freaking messing around. Marcus? God, man! It's just Marcus screwing around. Scott, I didn't do that, dude. Hey, you saw what happened. Marcus, what the f... Come on, man. Vic. Marcus. Help me clean this mess up. Marcus. You down here? Marcus. What are you doing? Hey. You all right? Hey. Marcus! Whoa! Whoa! - Stop doing that. - Woo! Uh, yeah, Dad. Hey, Rubies, it's Auna Rue. Super exciting day today, because I've hit a million followers. Just kidding. There's like 200 of you, um, but maybe someday... there will be more. Anyways, uh, other big news today. In an hour, I'm moving into Lisa's place. And tomorrow morning is my first day at Fellbrook High School. Fellbrook High School. It's like... the greatest school ever. Uh, their drama program is insane. Fun fact: Craig and Kate Parker went there, only two of, like, the biggest Broadway stars who probably have a million followers. I'm so excited. And, uh, it's gonna be awesome. It's gonna be really awesome and I'm happy and excited to share it with you. Anyways, uh, rambling. I'll have more very, very, very, very, very soon. Hey, you! How was the ride? It was good. Wow. I love all the vintage... and the bodies. Thanks. Gunner. I missed you so much. Sorry. One sec, okay? All right, no worries. Hey, dog. - Crazy busy, huh? - Yeah. This big show is just kicking my butt, - but it's good. - Yeah. Your whole line on display! Yeah. What is that? That's Guymon the Gargoyle. He keeps the bad spirits away. That's funny. Uh, so where should put my stuff, roomie? Um, you can put it just back there to the left. Um, I'm actually gonna be staying out in the studio leading up to the show. I'm just gonna be working late. It'll be easier. Oh. Yeah, of course. But it'll be cool, you know what I mean? You'll have the whole place to yourself for a while. So cool, so cool. I'm sorry, this is never ending. I really have to take this. Hey, I'm so sorry. - No, no, no... - Thank you. My sister just got here. Yeah. It's been three years and two children, Daniel. I didn't ask for this when we got married. Your son needs you. I need you. It's gonna be fine! I think it's a good monologue. It's a Bertolt Brecht play, it's perfect for you guys. I think you should do it. Uh, we got to get... We got to get moving. Okay, everybody. Let's get it together. All right. - James P? - Here. - Crystal? - Here. Oh. Auna... Auna Rue? Our new student? Here. Oh. Welcome. Okay, guys. Many of you already know this, but I will repeat it for our new thespians. NYU Tisch School of the Arts' top scout, good friend of mine, Scott Lamont, will be stopping by here later in the semester. So, we will focus solely on our fall monologues and those are gonna serve as your audition pieces. So, I need you guys to bring your A-game because this is a big opportunity. As I've always said, what have I said before? You can have all the talent in the world in here. What does it matter unless they see it out there? You got one shot, one opportunity. Are you quoting Eminem? Hey, hey. No, I'm quoting me. You know, I was background in 8 Mile. Okay? All right. Who wants to go first? Um, Mr. Schlake? Can I? Eager beaver. Are you sure you don't wanna take a little more time to workshop some material? No, I... I have something. Mm-hmm. Empress of Thayolund. Shh! Shh! Mom, Dad, look. I'm a princess. Shh! Auna, be quiet. No one can see my greatness because it shines from within. Um... None of this mattered. Today, I live for me... and today, I can... die for... - Stop it. - Um... - Look. - Auna, stop it. Auna? Why don't we stop there for now? And you can revisit the material and keep working on it, okay? Sorry, someone's in here. No! Sarah! If you do this, no one will see your greatness. Yes. No one can see my greatness because it shines from within. No one need remember me because it doesn't matter. None of this mattered. I know that now. Today, I live for me. And today, I can die for him. I went in, dude. Just knee-deep, did not care. Grabbed and snatched it right out of the sky. What were you on last week? Yo, why are you pouting? - Still sad about Gina? - He totally is. - No. - No? Well, well, well. It's my main man, Don. - The ladies' man. - Hey, man, you still rocking that V-card, though? Oh, man. I heard the ladies can't get their hands off of him. Yeah, when you rock this pink shirt, - I mean, why not? - It's just rewiring. Oh, heartbreaking. - Let me get her number. - Shut up. No, she was shallow, though. Come on, man. It could work out well. You're just like a regular stand-up guy. - I could take a few lessons... - Hey, Don. Uh, we're still on for tonight, right? Because, uh, I was thinking about coming over around 8:00, if that's okay with you. - Y... Yeah, it... It still works. - Cool. - See you, Don. - Yeah. We'll see you later, Stick. Let her go, man. It sucks it didn't work out, bro. - You have to... - Yo. - Hey. - Uh, hi. I was about to do the whole randomly-bump-trays- with-the-new-girl, but, uh, I thought it might be a little... - Little clich√©. - Yeah. - I'm Cade. - I'm... Auna. Right? Yeah. How did you know that? I maybe saw you on stage today. Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay... Hey, it's fine. It's fine. Oh, believe me, it was... It was not fine. No, seriously. Well, I've heard that class is tough. Um, honestly, I don't think I fit in here. Ah, it's not such a bad thing. You know, what you did over there. For Don? That was pretty cool. You saw that? Well, it was... It was really nice meeting you. Yeah. I'll talk to you later? If you're lucky. Okay. - What are you waiting for? - What happened over there? What was that? "If you're lucky"? Enough. "The year is 1710." And yet, if I knew, it was the last year of the life which is mine... "August Benjamin Rutherford." It's really scary. Victor, man, come on. What are you doing? Hi. Um, I'm looking for a stage play called The Gallows. Let's see. I don't think we have that, but you're welcome to check very quickly. Stage plays are aisle three, on the right. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. But we're closed. But I just... I'm sorry. Um, can I... I called you five times, Auna. - I'm sorry. - It's been an hour. - I was in the library. - And you didn't hear your phone in the library? Lisa, I'm sorry. Okay? I just... I got caught up reading a play. So, if you like scary stuff, I'm trying something called... Charlie Challenge. By the way, we could see... some craziness. "Sorrow, torment, pain." Fear with every breath. I am never alone, wanted am I, hunted am I. Ruin... "beckons me." Okay. Maybe you guys saw something that I didn't. But, uh, I hope you enjoyed my Charlie Challenge. Yes? Hey, can I borrow your charger? Gunner chewed up mine. Uh, yeah. I just, um... I need it back because my computer's on its death-bed. Good night. You slept in. Crap, my book. Auna, I'm gonna be late. Oh, you took your spirit protector thing down? No. Okay, 232 in your books, everyone. Two... And we're gonna be talking about three inventors in particular. Thomas Edison, Christopher Sholes, Alexander Graham Bell. Obviously, Thomas Edison, the electricity light bulb. Christopher Sholes invented the typewriter in 1867, and Alexander Graham Bell, the telephone in 1876, okay? So, in a very short period of time, the world is changing very quickly. We have light bulbs, we have typewriters, and we have... Okay. And see, that's what you did. So, you notice she changed her tactics... right when it... Silence the phones and witness the magic, people! All right, who's next? I'll go. Auna. I... You went yesterday, yes? I'd like to go again. Well, we don't... Sorrow... torment... pain... fear... With every breath, dost thou know such malevolent anguish? For I, I am never alone. Wanted am I. Hunted am I. Ruin beckons me. Shall I seek the one I love again? I call out... but the darkness, it answers not. Yea, the hangman's noose raises the hairs on my limbs and quaketh the depths of my marrow. Yea, even strike the very fear of death unto my soul. He cometh... for me. It's two different people, honestly, like, you know... - No, but seriously though... - Thanks. How did you memorize your lines? Auna! Hey. Hmm, good luck. Hi, Cade. This makes me lucky, right? Hey, you talked to me twice. Oh. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you're basically winning the lottery right now. Hey, um, there's this really good ice cream place that I bet you haven't been to. You doing anything tomorrow night? Uh, yes, yes. Oh, okay, yeah, maybe some other time. Oh, wait, no, no, no. I... I... I mean yes to the date, uh, slash hangout or whatever. Did you say date? You did not say date. I'm sorry, uh, I'm saying date but... Hey, it's a date. Let me give you my number. Okay. Uh, sorry, it's still off from theater. I'll wait. - Everything okay? - Uh, yeah. Yeah, everything's fine. Ooh. Your phone is blowing up. - Sure you're not already booked? - Uh, nope. - There you go. - Thanks. - So, I'll see you tomorrow? - If you're lucky. Oh, my God. What? Pain... fear with every breath... I bid thee... Dost thou know such malevolent anguish? Verily... "Oh, my love..." How art thou unafraid? For the hangman cometh for thee, for us both. Yea, although I fear death, "I cannot abandon my love." Okay. Shit! Yeah, it'll all be done by tomorrow, and I'm so sorry about the delay. No, no, no, I'm finishing up the sleeves and everything today. Thanks, Stacy. You got me. Oh, hey, Mom. Uh, no, I haven't seen anything. Hold on a second. Let me pull it up. No, don't worry. Yeah. I'll talk to her. I love you, bye. I don't know what happened. I don't know if it was just like adrenaline pumping or what. I... Mr. Schlake and everyone even applauded. Well, ice cream toast. - What are we toasting? - To you. So what happened in the first one, the first audition? Because that was really bad. - Do you want me to leave? - I'm kidding, I'm kidding... - Do you want me to leave? - No, no. Uh, yeah, it was pretty bad. - You don't wanna talk about it. - No, no, no, it's fine. - No. - It's fine, it's fine. I've wanted to be an actress since I was really little. Your name up in lights kind of thing? No, no, it was never that. That never even crossed my mind. I, um... I guess I just thought... maybe, if I had a chance someday to, like, prove myself, I could make an impact. You know, like, do something really important or timeless. But my parents and my sister... - You're just Auna. - Mom! They never really got it. My greatness shines from within! Auna, stop it. Nobody did. And, uh, that comes back to haunt me sometimes. But this Charlie Challenge stuff, all the views and the followers, it just... It just feels weird and very real. I know, but... is this Charlie stuff really gonna leave that impact that you want? I don't know. But it's nice to finally be seen. What's up, Mr. Hollywood? Hey! Just taking out this lovely girl - for the best ice cream. - Damn straight! - Hi. - Hi. - I'm Auna. - Auna. Did you know that you're on a date with a superstar? Now, Wally, come on. - What? - How's the folks doing? I ever tell you that I was in a production with them once? Only every time I come in. Who were your parents? Oh, it... It's nothing. - It's not important. - Cade. Girl. Hey, you're gonna be surprised. Take a look at the picture on that wall. No! Hey there, honey! Come on in here. Oh, my God. This is insane. Um, I'm Auna. Nice to meet you, Auna. Oh, my God. Why didn't you tell me your parents are actors? You never asked. I bet he didn't tell you about his old dream, either. - Oh, Mom, please don't. - No, she will. He played Little Ronnie Simmons on The Redenbachers for two and a half seasons. - You did not. - Oh, God. Oh my God, I see it, I see it. Our first Broadway opportunity called for a pregnant woman. - We committed for the role. - Oh, we committed. Oh, gross. Oh, that's just the story we wanted to hear, Mom. Be nice. Eventually, I just got tired of it. I got tired of having it pushed on me. I know acting is what they really want for me, but... Hmm. Sounds like your parents would swap us if they could. Yeah. You're probably not far off. Opposites attract though, right? Hey, do you want anything? Uh, yes. One Ronnie Simmons lunchbox, please. Okay. Now, if this is gonna be a thing, we're gonna have a problem. - Hi. - Hi. Sorry. We didn't mean to scare you. - We just, um... - That's okay. - Is that her? - Yeah, it's her. Could we get a quick picture? Yeah. Hi... Yeah, and another. Yeah, one more. Okay, cool. Uh, we saw your Charlie Challenge videos - and we totally subscribed. - I subscribed first. Thanks, guys. It was so cool that Charlie was, like, actually in the room with you. Yeah, I can't believe he picked you. Wait, sorry, what are you... Uh, thanks. - Keep making Charlie videos. - Thank you. Well, I hope my family didn't freak you out too bad. Oh, uh, no. No, it was... It was awesome. Yeah, I thought so too. Just hold still. - What? - You've got something. Oh, shoot. See you Monday? Lisa? God! God, Lisa! - Sorry. - Was that you? What? - What are you doing awake? - What are you doing awake? Auna, what? What happened to your hand? I... I slammed it in my closet. God. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. - Look, I talked with Mom, okay? - God. And look, I agree with her, all right? You're wasting your time with all of this Charlie... garbage, I mean... What are you doing? Good night, Lisa. - Auna. - Have fun playing dress up or whatever it is you do. Okay, good talk. Um... "Sorrow, torment, pain..." Jesus, what is it? Um... Are you okay? This isn't like what you did before. Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm just a little off. - You sure? - Yeah, um... "Yea, the hangman's..." Be right back. - Mr. Schlake? - Yes, my starlet? Um, I've been doing some thinking and, uh, I think there's still some time to try another monologue. Oh, no, no, no, no, listen, Auna, everyone's had doubts. Heck, I've had doubts, right? And I know your confidence in this particular material has dipped, but, Auna... people are gonna remember this one. Just do whatever you did last time. Okay? Sorry, what was that line? I'll see you. Where are we going? Uh, I just wanna show you something. Come on. Not very many people know about this. Uh, who built this? Nick did. But I helped a little. Oh, frick. Come on. It's cool, huh? This thing looks really janky. So... you bring all of your lady friends up here? Yeah, only the tens, though. Although, there was Gina but... she was more like an 11, so... Ow! I was kidding. Are you okay? Yeah. I mean, she actually ended up being really fake, you know. She's not as genuine as... some people. - What's this for? - Hit record. - I need a partner in crime. - Wait, what? I need to practice my monologue and the fans have been waiting for a new video. So I thought we could do something... Oh, Auna, come on. Not... Like, is it that important? Yeah. Yeah, it is... it is important. My fans are important and so is the monologue. And if... I have to show them I'm something, Cade. - You understand... - Hey, hey. If I mess it up, it... I'm sorry. You'll do this. And maybe you don't see it, but I do. I cannot... abandon my love. I cannot abandon... my love. I cannot abandon right in front of... Cade? Cade? - I don't know what's happening. - No! No! Stop, stop! - Are you okay? - Me? Auna, you were choking. I thought you were gonna pass out. Auna? Just tell me what's wrong. Cade, can you take me home? Right now. Yeah. Let's go. Ow. Auna! - I'm sorry. - Oh, my God. Did you... I'm going to bed. Mr. Schlake? I need to switch monologues. I can't do Gallows anymore. Auna, that's not possible. - You're... - Just let me give. Return to Thayolund another try. Just watch. I never saw him again after that night. Marcus... I don't understand what's happening. I can't think straight. I can't sleep. There's no one to talk to. Auna. Auna! Wait. I'm all alone. Except that I'm... never alone. Since that night, I've had this. He is everywhere. 35th president of the United States, John F. Kennedy... Auna? Would you mind reading that section for us? The middle of 460 please. "In September 1961, JFK signed the bill" enacting the Disarmament Agreement, and lo the terrors that consume me cometh "by the Hangman." - It's everywhere. - Uh, I think you might be on the wrong spot. Try 470. I can't escape it. I feel... so hopeless... and so out of control. I don't know... I don't know... how much more I can take. Well done. You about gave me a heart attack! Oh, good. Good. I'm so glad you decided to stick with the Gallowspiece. - It's just dynamite. - Wait. What? Scott's gonna be very impressed. Mr. Schlake, can you help me real quick? Yeah. Stick to it. That spotlight calls. Auna? Animal control will be here to take care of the remains. You two just take care of each other, okay? Thank you. Look at us. Wait. Why do you still have this? Lisa, stop. - No. Don't do that. - Get this trash - out of my house. - I can't believe you. This thing is hurting you, it's hurting both of us. You don't know anything about it. Oh, yeah? Auna, what... What the hell is this then, huh? What, are you hurting yourself? Auna, please. Just tell me - what is going on. - Oh, you care about me all of a sudden, huh? After treating me like a stepsister - our whole lives? - Auna, stop this. No, you got everything from Mom and Dad. They supported you, they believed in you. Now, I'm finally proving you all so wrong. I'm finally making a name for myself. And people are appreciating me. Auna, I can't do this, okay? My show is tomorrow, my job is... What about my audition? Wake up, Auna. Nothing is gonna come from that audition. There are literally thousands of other people trying to do the exact same thing, and with a lot more talent. You can't do this, Auna. You never could. Just give it up. Auna... I'll let you pack. Auna, please. Good luck tomorrow. I've reached the end. The peasant hangs himself. No, don't. This is... This is live. I'd like... I'd like that. He's right behind... He's in the room with you. No. No. No. No, please stop. - I need this. - No. What are you doing? - That's mine. - Someone is trying to commit suicide. She just took my charger and said someone was trying - to commit suicide. - She said what? No! So we're gonna need some administration down here in the computer lab. We have a serious situation with a student. Hey. Wait. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey. Stop. Auna? Five minutes. God. Hush. Mary walks. The smell of the moon follows her. But her eyes follow my cousin. Would she kiss a poor fishmonger? Would she wrap her arms around the stench? Next up, Auna Rue. Auna... you can go now. Hey, hey, where is she? Where is she? Do... Get out there. Auna. Auna, go. Auna. Auna. Auna, that was incredible. - That was incredible. - Thank you, Mr. Schlake for everything. I knew you were a star. The right person to set the scene. Auna? Yes. Scott Lamont, it's a pleasure to meet you. Oh, um, believe me, the pleasure is all mine. Listen, can we... Can we chat privately for a moment? Oh, of course. Auna, this scholarship is something you really want, isn't it? I... Yes, um, being, uh, a great actress is my dream. Good. I got to tell you, your monologue was out of this world. I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it. How would you like to attend the NYU next year on a full scholarship? Um, I'd love to. - I would love to. - Great. Great. Oh, you know what? Uh, I'm just curious, what's that monologue from? I don't recognize it. It's called The Gallows. Oh, The Gallows, that's the one the kids are doing, right? Because it's haunted? This Charlie kid, he, uh, um, he hangs himself. "Oh, now the show is cursed." Some nonsense. These superstitions, this, uh, Macbeth, break a leg, Charlie, Charlie is all a bunch of poppycock. Auna? Are you... Well, we'll be in contact with you and, uh, Mr. Schlake. So, um, great. Hey, it's me. Um, I just wanted to say, um, I hope you have a great audition tonight and, um... And I'm sorry. About the things I said. You're talented, Auna. You deserve better. Call me back and, um, let me know how it went. I love you. Bye. What do you want? Hey, it's me. Um, I just wanted to say, um, I hope you have a great audition tonight and, um... And I'm sorry. About the things I said. You're talented, Auna. You deserve better. Call me back and, um, let me know how it went. I love you. Bye. Mom? Charlie Grimille? You shouldn't say that name. Blake! Blake? I need you back here. Hey, wait there! Hey! Cade? Auna. Hey. Hey. It's good to hear your voice. Listen. I'm sorry. I am so sorry about Lisa and... I guess I just... I didn't understand everything that was happening. Cade, I'm so lost. I don't know what to do. It's really good to hear your voice. I've been doing more research on this play. Auna. I think I found someone who can end all of this. Hey. What are you two doing in here? Did you check in at the front desk? Uh, nobody was at the front desk. We came to visit her, uh... we're her cousins. From Independence. She hasn't seen us in a long time. Whatever. Front desk. Never anybody at the front desk. Story of my life. You got five minutes. Don't do anything stupid. I'll check in at the front desk. I didn't know what it was. Uh, I didn't understand. I thought it was a stupid game. The Charlie Challenge. You should be careful. Using his name. Why? Why do you say anybody's name? To call upon them. That's why you need to be careful. You really don't know. Do you? My sister is dead. I need help. The key is sacrifice. What kind of sacrifice? The willing kind. I did the show for my father. To make those that did this to him pay. Reese... He willingly gave his life for me. It was beautiful. What are you talking about? Just tell me what to do to make it stop. It won't stop. The killings? They'll never stop. Until a willing sacrifice is made. He wants you! He's coming for you! - Nurse. - He wants you! - Wait, wait, stop, stop. - He's coming for you! Let go. Let go of me. Don't fucking touch me. Hey, are you okay? Auna? Hey. You okay? Yeah. Oh, I won't let anything like that happen to you. What are you doing? It doesn't matter. Just... I wish I had realized that sooner. Auna! Cade! Help! Help! Auna! No! Cade! Help! Let go of me. Let go. Don't hurt her. Stop your struggling. Cade? Cade! - Auna, are you okay? - Cade! Cade! - Stop. - Let go. You're "almostfamous." Auna. It's the one who sent me the Charlie Challenge video. The one who's been messaging me, watching me. Stop! It must be one of you. What the hell are you talking about? You're insane. Cade. Get us out of this. It's the sacrifice. - A willing sacrifice. - No. Auna, please. This? Don't even talk like that. One of you must be willing. That is what he wants. Who is he? One of you must be willing. That's what he wants. - Take me. - No, Cade. - Auna, stop. - No! It's my fault! Stop. I love you. No! No! Stop! It's my fault. Please, don't do this to him. It's my fault. Let him live. Take me. Let him live. Take me. Auna. Why don't we stop there now? - Right, Lisa? - You can't do this, Auna. You never could. - Give it up. - Mom! Dad! Wait. Read this. Remember, your greatness... shines from within. Today, I live for me. And today, I can die for him. We did it, we did it. This is "almostfamous99." And I hope you enjoyed a perfect Charlie Challenge.
