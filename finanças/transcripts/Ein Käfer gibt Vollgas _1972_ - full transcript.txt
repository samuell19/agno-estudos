he's on the phone of course whatever you say this is plato why don't you come here and bring the letter when you come good that's a good place sure i'll be alone all right goodbye go see what's taking them so long it appears that stan shibulski had the other plate somewhere in the villa according to this good it almost solves the case he sounds like a cop or the fbi not exactly i work for the fbscn and just what the hell is that the federal bureau of security for coins and notes that's right it's an organization that's supported by the international banking community for the purpose of stamping out the worldwide traffic in counterfeit banknotes and now i need your help general service at your service in your plato of course we always take ten percent that can be arranged what do you want us to do let's see what if i were to talk the market into searching the villa we'll let him do the work and when he finds the plate you folks will move in with the police here first you'll contact this number give them the exact location of the house where chebulski lived we'll set up an observation unit in the house next door and you give us a sign as soon as you find the plate that's a good idea maggie if you'll let us up the market first we have an old score to settle i think i can arrange it watch it i think we have company coming good luck i'll be counting on you we'll do our best all right it's about time they found the place we'll have to move in then they won't be expecting anything i can take care of them that's easy to say is that the trick kane well what's it filled with what gun powder gun power yeah is that all the equipment i get well what more do you want you'll see jimmy shall i record the whole thing of course i hit something senor is that it yes the underside forgetting one thing they're mine you know shapiro see that our friend gets what's coming to him will you whatever he's got coming i'll give him double yeah if you think we're that stupid you got it wrong mister i suppose that means you think you now own these printing plates you bet we do samuel do you intend to make counterfeit money with them as much as we possibly can these engravings are of extremely high quality market what's my cut in the deal i can't believe you'd seriously think of parting me from one cent of my money you're very wrong there marchese either pay the price that those engravings are worth or this time they can send you to prison him shut his mouth one day yours is stanley chubowski around i thought perhaps what's that you boys studying archaeology who are you

work jimmy that's that look plato do you want the marquesa to escape if he gets to his boat before we do we'll never see the plates again get dressed and follow me what's going on deploy 40 men as fast as possible along the beach refuel the motorboat and wait for the signal to attack that's all senior plato will need every man you've got i wish i could do something for him but i can't why not the information we just received indicates that the marquesa has summoned his entire bodyguard to cover the coast you should send for reinforcement shouldn't you i already have but there may not be time for them to arrive from lisbon dodo come as fast as you can hurry surely you know plato needs help i must wait till reinforcements have arrived jimmy yeah wait don't you think there's too many of them for you i'll let dodo take half the gang i can manage the others if there are any left over you're welcome to them oh all right just me and you now i hope not you're all mistaken aren't you you'd

keep them safe till i come back which one of you is plato he's plato i see you've had some trouble at these ruffians should i arrest them no no actually i prefer you to arrest the man responsible for the counterfeiting of dollar bills before he gets away with the plates excuse me inspector may i and where is this man he's right over there but you'll have to run to catch him you can't prove he's a counterfeiter without plates and neither can i arrest him yeah that's why i wonder sometimes why i gave up my profession as a schoolteacher you refuse to arrest him not just on your accusation can't you see he's escaping so what get it out there's got to be a way of helping him photo's better at that than we are dodo we need help now come as fast as you can engine switch over to automatic pilot
