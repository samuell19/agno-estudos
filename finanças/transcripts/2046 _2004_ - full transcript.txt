Intheyear2046 every railway network spreads the globe A mysterious train leaves for 2046 every once in a while Every passenger who goes to 2046 has the same intention They want to recapture lost memories Because nothing ever changes in 2046 Nobody really knows if that's true Because nobody's ever come back Except me If someone wants to leave 2046... how long will it take? Some people get away very easily Others find that it takes them much longer I forget how long I've been on this train I start to feel very lonely As I recall many have gone to 2046 You're the first to come back May I ask why you left 2046? Whenever one asked why I left 2046... I gave them some vague answers Before... when people had secrets they didn't want to share ...they'd climb a mountain They'd find a tree and carve hole in it And whisper the secret into the hole Then cover it over with mud That way, nobody else would ever discover it I once fell in love with someone After a while, she wasn't there I went to 2046 I thought she might be waiting for me there But I couldn't find her I can't stop wondering if she loved me or not But I never found out Maybe her answer was like a secret... that no one else would ever know All memories are traces of tears Didn't you promise not to come back? I came to see you Why? I have no prospects here So I'll see how things are in Hong Kong When are you leaving? The boat sails in two days Why are you telling me? I thought we might go together You know nothing about my past, do you? If you'd rather not tell me I don't mind If you win, I'll join you She found an indirect way of rejecting me As I recall... ...that was the very last time we saw each other Right after that, I left Singapore I got back to Hong Kong at the end of 1 966 There was riots in Kowloon due to the price rise of ferry ticket I wasn't sure how long I'd be staying... So I took a room in a small hotel in Wanchai I wrote columns for the Newspapers They paid HK$1 0 per thousand words It was pretty tough at first As long as I could make ends meet ...it made no difference what kind of stuff I wrote 'Diary of the Bezooke Hero' The new star at Club Luk Kwok is Fai Fai! A knockout beauty with amazing bezookes! A smash hit with tit-lovers! Hang on, of course I exaggerate I can't say her tits are fake, can l? I soon got used to this kind of life I became an expert of ladies Lots of one-night-stands Never mind nothing lasts forever anyway 24-Dec-66 Is that really true? Why would I lie to you? You really know me? Weren't you in a show in Singapore in 64? Yes You're Lu-lu I was then Not anymore What's your name now? Why should I tell you? On Christmas Eve 1 966... ...I ran into a friend from Singapore in a nightclub We'd been rather close But that night... ...she'd apparently forgotten me Have we really met before? How could you forget? You said I looked like your last boyfriend You taught me the Cha-cha Go on... You were always dragging me to the casino You'd hit a losing streak You owed a fortune My friends and I paid for your passage to Hong Kong You talked a lot about your last boyfriend A Chinese Filipino from a rich family You planned to marry him But he died young You said he was the only love of your life At this time of year... I shouldn't bring back sad memories But do you remember that Christmas night... we went drinking? We talked a lot Was she just pretending she'd forgotten me? I took her back to her hotel She was drunk She'd had too much to drink... ...so I left quickly On my way out I noticed very a familiar number If I hadn't run into her that night I wouldn't have seen that number ...and I wouldn't have written '2046' Can I help you? Is Miss Lu-lu in? Lu-lu? There's no Miss Lu-lu here There was a Mimi... ...but she's moved out But I was here two days ago! Do you know where she's gone? No! What do you want with her? Nothing, really I have her key. I wanted to return it You can give it to me Thanks You want to rent the room? I'm just back from abroad I don't have my own place yet If the room's vacant I could take a look This is just a small hotel But our residents are all decent people What's your line of work? I write for newspapers Great! A fellow artist! I haven't always done this I used to be an artist too Really? I took singing lessons in Haerbin By then, I was a tenor It'll be a pleasure to have you here When will you move in? As soon as possible But... 2046 has to be redecorated 2047 is vacant Take a look at it Never mind I'll come back when it's ready Why that particular room? Maybe it's the number It has some significance for you? I'm joking Tell you what... Take a quick look at 2047 If it's okay, you can move in Then switch to 2046 when it's ready How about it? Can I see the room? Of course! Please... Once I moved in, I found out... just the night before... Lu-lu was stabbed by a jealous boyfriend A drummer from the club She'd really liked him... ...and compared him with a bird that could never land For all these years... She has been looking for her leg-less bird Most of her affairs ended badly But she didn't mind sad endings No matter what happened... ...at least she was always the leading lady Good! Sure! Go! Let's go! Let's go! I'll go with you! Good. I'll go with you! Sure! I understand! You know what I mean? I know... I understand I got it! Can I go? I can go! Sure! I understand! Got it! It didn't take long to finish redecorating 2046 But by then I was used to 2047 Sure! I started hearing a strange voice through the wall I thought someone had moved in But it was the daughter of the hotel owner, Mr. Wang Definitely! I'm definitely going! Okay, let's go! I had no idea what she was saying The staff told me it was Japanese It seems she had a Japanese boyfriend Tell the driver 220 Granville Road Ge... ran... wei... 220 Granville Road Turn from Humphrey's Avenue near to Kimberley Road Can you say again? Don't turn down Salisbury Road Slowly, please... I'll draw you a map No, that's my pen! I'll repeat it once more Turn from Humphrey's Avenue Near to Kimberley Road But don't turn down Salisbury Road Understand? No I'll draw you a map No Granville Road Turn from Humphrey's Avenue Don't turn down Salisbury Road Remember, don't turn down Salisbury Road His company in Japan had sent him to Hong Kong When he got here he checked into this hotel The world is full of men! Why do you have to choose a Japanese? Get rid of him! I will never meet him! You want my blessing? Not while I'm alive! It had been going on for ages But due to Mr. Wang's opposition So they had to break up Can you tell me what you feel? Do you like me? Or not? I'm scared to hear your answer But I have to ask anyway Leave with me Goodbye The man finally went back to Japan That's when Miss Wang began talking to herself Hey, ask your boss to turn it down a bit! Mr. Chow you'd better ask him yourself Mr. Chow... Hasn't he left already? Why is he back? I will not see him! If you won't give him up... Get out! Go away with him! I assumed that Mr. Wang played it so loud... ...because he loved his opera Actually he didn't want anyone to overhear the family matters What are you doing? Come back for me when you're a little older! I said, wait till you grow up! I like it Mr. Wang's biggest trouble ...is about his two daughters The elder one was crazy about her Japanese man The younger one was precarious for her age She kept coming into my room for drinks Then she ran off with another drummer from a club band After she left her elder sister got into trouble too Hey, have a word with your boss for me I'm a bit late with the rent Anyway, he has my deposit Mr. Chow, tell him yourself He's in a foul mood these days What's eating him? First, one daughter ran away Now the other one's in hospital That's why he's so angry Why is she in hospital? He wouldn't say he was quite strange... Stay clear of him! So, that's it? Anyhow, give him my invitation It's my father's birthday banquet He can deduct his gift from the rent I owe Later they imposed a curfew in Hong Kong Home-made bombs caused panic The economy stopped then I stopped going out Some thought I was a reformed character Actually, I was writing a story called '2046' All about men and women looking for love... ...risking everything to get to a place called 2046 What's that? Let's go to... I made it as bizarre and erotic as possible without crossing the line The readers liked it Some didn't take to the science-fiction angle But all '2046' meant to me was... ...the number of a hotel room I made up the whole thing But some of my own experiences found their way into it People I ran into in the normal course of things... ...turned up in my stories I felt more and more at ease in my fiction world Around that time Mr. Wang's music got louder again More trouble with his two daughters... But also because of the bad state of the economy A lot of the rooms were empty Then in September, the rioting ended Life went back to normal Soon, someone moved into 2046 Have you nearly finished? It's too early in the day for that! Some of us are trying to sleep! Peeking? The woman next door is quite a dish! What are my chances? You're off your head! A father-to-be shouldn't have that on his mind! Now she's pregnant My wife won't let me touch her! Come on Put in a word for me Okay... How much? How much have you got? Only $1 00... Wait for my call Mr. Chow! Mr. Chow, a call for you! Would it be too early, huh? She's not up yet Why come over? I told you, it has to be arranged She's not some street walker! A fellow artist like you Show her a little respect, will you? Yes, I'll tell you right away! Miss Bai, your key You're back, Miss Bai Who is it? Who are you looking for? Mr. Chow suggested I come by... You're back, Mr. Chow Did you win on the dogs? I lost! I won a little Looking for me? I think you know this person? What are you doing in that room? You said you'd arrange it! I paid you! When did I say it was this room? I want this one I said that room I said this one Your girl's in that room I said this one How embarrassing! Please excuse him I told you, the room on the left! I said I wanted that one! Shut up! Who is it? Oh, you again! I just wanted to apologize for last night Forget it. Go away My editor was out of line But he's not really so bad Just a bit stingy! Never pays his way! Always says he's broke when the check arrives So I thought I'd play a trick on him At my expense? Didn't you go a bit far? He only fall for it because you're so beautiful You're quite a flirt! Just stating the fact! A small token of apology please accept it I don't want it You're still mad, aren't you? Please accept it No! Come on... No! It's just a token... Don't make fun of me. I mean what I say! Now, get out! That's good, let it all out How can I make you feel better? Slap me again! Think I wouldn't dare? Come closer! Bastard! Don't be so petty! That's enough I'm courteous enough not to slap you again That doesn't mean you can take advantage! This time I'll give you face If there's ever a next time I'll be less polite It won't happen again My face is still numb Accept it! No! They're just a token of my regard I chose them myself See if you like them If you don't, just throw them away Good I'll leave now Calm down! It's none of your business who I dated last night! Who? Dabao! Which Dabao? The fat one or the skinny one? From Shanghai or from Shandong? The trouble is I know so many men named Dabao How should I know which one you mean? Yes, I did What are you going to do about it? Fine! I'll be waiting! Let me just say... Get out! You think I can accept this? Her or me You'd better choose! Now get out! 24-Dec-67 You're back early! It's Christmas! Shouldn't you behaving dinner with your boyfriend? What boyfriend? Then let's have supper! Come on... You have so many girlfriends! You need company? Go out with them! They all want to be with me but I can't choose The fairest thing is to see none of them Come on, no point in staying cooped up in your room I'm not in a good mood tonight I might get drunk... ...and slap you again That's okay I'm used to it! If slapping me would make you happy take that as my Christmas present! Come on... Come with me Let's go! I didn't expect to spend Christmas like this What were you expecting? We'd made plans He was taking me to Singapore He says it's warm there at Christmas So I didn't even pack winter clothes What I'm wearing now... ...is for summer! Have you been to Singapore? I worked there for several years What kind of work? One newspaper Is it fun there? It's okay Tell me more I won't be going... so I'll just have to imagine it What do you want to know? How's the climate? Pretty warm All year round Sometimes you can't tell what season it is The food stalls are great! Ping and I ate there after work We'd eat and drink till dawn Our landlord was a funny man Short and fat and he always wore a skirt what the Malays call 'sarong' But when you're away from home ...it sometimes gets bored That was a dull meal! Another drink somewhere else? You really like to drink? It makes things easy When I'm drunk, I have no worries! Won't your girlfriends be missing you tonight? They're not stuck to me! They see other men too We just have fun together They still need to make a living! I don't get it Where does all that 'fun' get you? If you find the right person... ...why waste time on the others? If I find the right person! A man like me has nothing much ...except free time That's why I need company So people are just time-fillers to you? I wouldn't say that Other people can borrow my time too And this evening? Are you borrowing me or am I borrowing you? No difference! Maybe I borrowed you earlier... ...and then you're borrowing me Ridiculous! Don't get me wrong I don't intend to take advantage of you If that was what I wanted... ...I had plenty of options I just want us to be drinking pals Is that okay? It's hard But I'll give it a try Okay... Let's try! Where to? Let's drink! Mr. Chow, you seem happy tonight! I certainly am my friends are buying me dinner This way please... Ping! Is it someone's birthday? Better than that Chow has a new girl friend! Definitely worth celebrating! Mr. Chow what would you like to eat tonight? Something expensive! Snake? Yes, snake would be good Snake isn't cheap Sure you'll win the bet? Shut up! Don't mind him What'll it be Mr. Chow? Snake! And a lamb casserole too And bring Hoi's whiskey Yes! Good! Can't let this go to waste it's delicious Where's your girl, Chow? It's already 2 a.m. Is she coming? She isn't coming She can't be coming I don't think she's coming It's all your fault It's because of you that this happened Why blame me? You brought this on yourself You said she was gentle and obedient Now we know the truth! I said she was sometimes obedient... ...and sometimes gentle But she's full of surprises. That's fun So, what next? Yes, what now? What's more I can do? Whatever you feel like doing And then what happened? Tell me! How are you going to thank me? Pervert! Open up! Who is it? Open the door! It's late You played a fine joke on me tonight I finished work late Too late to get there So I didn't come What's this? That's your fault too How could I know you'd stand me up? I thought I'd wine few hundred Instead I lost my moustache This is all your fault You deserved it Who pushed you into the bet? I'll tell you something... Ping asked me not to show up Anyhow... I wasn't that fond of the moustache You look younger now Don't you like it? You're making fun of me! You tricked me! I'll get you for this How will you make it up to me? At least give me a kiss You bit me! Come and get me! You're in for it when I catch you! Don't touch me there! You fool are you going to peel my skin off? You think you are being merciful? I am bleeding I wonder if the weather matters Just a lamb casserole and I am like this Do you think I've gone wild? What? Don't move! What are you doing? Shaving you Don't! Who knows where that shaver's been It may bring me bad luck Let's go for Round Two! I don't want it Why are you dressed? I'm going back to my room... I'm exhausted This is all I have Aside from loose change for the bus Here's $200 Please take it I don't want it I wasn't selling That's not how I meant it I want to pay for your torn dress Please take it I see... You're afraid I'll cling to you is that it? Fine... I'll take $1 0 Think of it as a discount rate If you ever want to come over again ...I'll charge the same I'm going back to my room Come here Not tonight Why not? Not in the mood? Can't take the strain tonight Anyhow, I'm a bit short of cash Never mind, you can owe me No... I don't like being in debt The reception's at 6, dinner at 8 I don't mind if you can't make it just send your gift No more than you do! You hold banquets all year round! I've had four birthday invitations from you this year! I'll send over some more invitation cards later Think of people with money... Write in their names and send them invitations! Okay. That's settled Mr. Chow, holding another banquet? You know we have birthdays in different calendars? Another of mine has come around No doubt Here's one for your boss Alright Tell him that since we're so close... He can deduct his gift from the rent I owe Make sure he gets it Okay It's late, what's so urgent? Just got back from Macau Chow asked me to bring you a present You two went to Macau? Yes, we had some days off So we went to the casino Oh, it's beautiful He says he found some money... ...in his pocket So before losing it all at the tables... ...he bought you a present Where is he? Not back yet. You know what he's like Extravagant at the start of the month ...and broke wall before the end He made several thousand hosting that party So now he's really enjoying himself! Is he there alone? Of course not! There's a gang of them He likes company Was he always like this? Let's not talk about him Let's have a drink But I should warn you... I know you like Chow a lot Don't waste your time on him He's not serious! Guess who? There's only one possibility! Let me have a bite first! What are you doing here? What am I doing here? What do you think? I thought I was pretty wild But you're much wilder! Pay up! I haven't seen you for ages I've been busy Liar Tell me the truth I am! Who was that woman the other day? What woman? Don't pretend I saw her leaving your room Who is she? A friend A friend? What was she doing in your room? Don't be nosy, alright? Go back to your room I have work to do I won't! I'm sleeping here tonight An overnight stay is expensive No problem Name your price I'd pay anything to be with you Every day Retail is fine Wholesale is out of the question Why? I just don't like it Could you make an exception for me? No You treat all women like this? Except one Who? My mother I'm serious I don't mind you having other women But I won't be treated the same as them I don't care if you love me or not I'll love you anyway Since we got together I haven't brought other men back I hoped you'd think the same way Will you promise me that? No I see... Then we're through I'll never bother you And I don't ever want you in my room again Here, $1 0! Tonight, I'm paying Thank you! If you're ever in the mood feel free to come over I'll charge you the same Having fun? What do you care? You were rather loud last night I meant to be You bring back women why shouldn't I have men? I want to see if you really don't mind I won't go why don't you come here instead? Forget it! Don't come! After Bai Ling moved out... ...she started dating Dabao And I saw other women too If our paths ever crossed we'd pretend not to see each other Rather pathetic, I know But it was better for us to end it this way We haven't kept in touch for long Despite the fact that... she pops up in my stories Your change, please check it Thank you Are you going out later? Why? Could you post this letter for me? Sure Then Miss Wang came back I knew from the familiar sound coming through the wall Please take me with you! Good! What are you doing? Wasn't I clear? Don't contact that Japanese man! Why are you writing to him in secret? Aren't you ashamed? Return his letter! No? What are you reading? A martial-arts novel You like them? If your friend wants to send you more letters and you don't want your dad to know tell him to send them to my room I'll pass them on to you She looked happier when she came back this time We talked more often Mr. Chow, another letter for you Another! Those Japanese girls are so passionate Let's see each other again Then if you still think we shouldn't be together... ...tell me so, frankly That day, six years ago... ...a rainbow appeared in my heart It's still there Like a flame burning inside me But what are your real feelings for me? Are they like a rainbow after the rain? Or... ...did that rainbow fade away long ago? I'm waiting for your answer Why do you write all that stuff about sex? So I won't starve! Don't you worry about your reputation? Maybe I'm not such a nice guy Why not try writing something else? Who'd read it? How about a martial-arts novel? People love them That's too hard I tried once co-writing it with someone We locked ourselves away for months Just got sore heads Those were good times... I like writing too It's hard to make a living by writing I just do it for fun I'll show you some of my stuff Please do Here you are, read this first Wow, you're prolific! When you've read it tell me what you think Don't forget to give it back! Sure! Have you read my story yet? I have What did you think? I think you should never write another word Why not? You're so good You could put me out of work The Spider Saga thrusts out his right fist! Two chopsticks take off like rockets! They land with explosive force! Kaboom! The mountain splits apart! Slow down, I can't keep up Come on, they' re waiting for it Alright... Caught up? Go on Where was l? The mountain splits apart... Right... The mountain splits apart... ...smashing lron Abacus to the ground! Iron Abacus? Isn't he dead? Is he? Then make it lron Head Where did lron Head come from all of a sudden? Hey, anything goes in martial-arts novels! Why don't you get some rest? I'll finish it for you Okay It felt like having an assistant When I was late with my copy I asked her to ghost it for me She was just a girl... ...but she could write as realistic as the best of us We got along very well That was my happiest summer ever But it didn't last... I encouraged her to face up to her father But she didn't dare She wanted to pay her own way So I got her a job in the cloakroom at a club Thanks! She told her father... ...she was going out with me Sometimes I found an excuse to pick her up after work You're here late If you're ready to go I have a taxi waiting I can give you a lift back No thanks Then I won't wait Feelings can creep up on you unawares I knew that, but did she? She was always asking... ...if there was anything at all that never changed I could see what was on her mind I promised to write a story for her based on my observation Something to show her what her boyfriend was thinking As a joke... we thought of calling it '2047' But maybe I was being too oblique I'd begun to feel that it wasn't about her boyfriend at all Rather it was more about me So I began imagining myself as a Japanese man... ...on a train for 2046... ...falling for an android with delayed reaction If someone wants to leave 2046 how long will it take? No one can say Some people get away very easily Others find that... ...it takes them much longer It takes great strength And it can hurt terribly I forget how long I've been on this train I start to feel very lonely It's rather boring at first But you slowly get used to it We have a range of cabin attendants They can satisfy your every need They will serve you devotedly Like an intimate friend But you must never fall in love with them Who'd ever fall for an android? Who can say? Events can creep up on you... ...without you even noticing It happens all the time Paragraph 201 in the Passengers' Guide... ...warns that Area 1224-1225... ...is especially cold The train heating won't be strong enough Passengers are advised to hug each other to keep warm Since I'm the only passenger... ...I hug my android cabin attendant I wonder if it's her mechanism or just my imagination... But I sense some responsive warmth in her artificial body It hurts... Why do you want to leave 2046? Do you know... ...what people did in the old days... ...when they had secrets they didn't want to share? They'd climb a mountain... Find a tree... Carve a hole in it... Whisper the secret into the hole... And cover it up with mud That way... ...nobody else would ever learn the secret I'll be your tree! Tell me, and nobody else will ever know I always... I... I always... Very funny! I... I always... Whenever anyone asked why I left 2046... I always... ...I gave them some vague answer I always... I once fall in love with someone I couldn't stop wondering whether she loved me or not I found an android which looked just like her I thought the android might give me the answer 1 0 hours later I have a secret to tell you Leave with me I have a secret to tell you Leave with me I kept on asking But she never answered I began dreaming up excuses for her silence Do you know the Buddhist canon? 'The 5 Decays of Celestial Beings'? The 5 Decays of Celestial Beings It's all about the gods... and how they go through this process too Our cabin attendants are superbly designed But there's one problem When they've served on so many long journeys... ...fatigue begins to satin They might want to laugh... ...but the smile would be slow to come They might want to cry... ...but the tear wouldn't weep till next day! This one is falling fast I think you'd better give up I grew desperate I felt like giving up But I was soon trying again I have a secret to tell you Will you leave with me? I have a secret to tell you Will you leave with me? Do you know what people did in the old days... ...when they had secrets? They'd climb a mountain, find a tree Carve a hole in it... I slowly began to doubt myself The reason she didn't answer... ...was not simply that her reactions were delayed It's simply that she didn't love me So at last I got it It's entirely beyond my control The only thing left for me... ...was to give up 24-Dec-68 Why are you inviting me to Christmas dinner? You know how much I'll lose in tips by not working? Wouldn't it be awful to be alone tonight? I need company That means me? Your boyfriend hasn't written in a while I told him not to Anyway, it's hopeless No point waiting for me Why is it hopeless? Go and look for him! If you don't, it really will be hopeless My dad will never give his consent If you were him... ...what would you be doing tonight? Why don't you ask him? Have you got his phone number? I can't hear you Can you speak louder? I'm already shouting! I felt like Santa Claus that night I took her to the newspaper office... and let her make a long-distance call to her boyfriend I was happy... ...to see her so happy In fact, Area 1 224-1 225... ...meant Christmas Eve and Christmas Day On the night before Christmas... ...many people need a bit more warmth than usual I didn't get that Maybe that was for the best 1 0 hours later I realized... ...the reason the android didn't answer... ...had nothing to do with her mechanism wearing out Nor that she didn't like him More likely... ...she already loved someone else Soon after that, she went to Japan I gave her a copy of my story 2047 I hope she read it 1 00 hours later 1 000 hours later Love is all a matter of timing It's no good meeting the right person... ...too soon or too late If I'd lived in another time or place... ...my story might have had a very different ending I have to tell you... Yes? I'll be away for a couple of days Please pay my daughter this month's rent She's back? Not Jingwen? I mean pay my younger girl, Jiewen So your worries are over! Going on holiday? No, I have to go to Japan But you hate Japanese! Why go to Japan? Jingwen is getting married Congratulations I wasn't sure whether to go or not Now I've decided... I just want her to be happy When do you leave? Can you help me choose a present? No need for that She wanted me to ask you something What is it? She read your story '2047' She likes it a lot But she finds the ending too sad She wonders if you can change it? I'll see what I can do An hour later 1 0 hours later 1 00 hours later Taxi! I also like the story to have a happy ending But I don't know how to write it Some years back I had a happy ending in my grasp But I let it slip away Don't turn your back on me! Has he been here? What's it to you? While I was depressed I ran into Lu-lu again She hadn't changed still intensively jealous You think he's yours? I thought you knew him well! That's the way he is! We've just been amusing ourselves So control yourself, Missy! Watching her taught me something When you don't take 'no' for an answer... ...there is still a chance you'll get what you want 1 8 months later Hello, is Mr. Chow there? I know I have no right to ask... ...but they say I need a guarantor The man who recruits girls for the nightclub... ...says he knows you Can you talk to him for me? No problem I know the man you mean I'll see him in a day or two Why did you choose Singapore? I don't want to stay here any longer I've been thinking about it for some time I went to take a look at the place Don't drink too much You don't look well Don't worry, it won't kill me You know what? I came by here at Christmas I thought I might run into you Why didn't you call me first? I don't know I came on impulse I don't know why That night I suddenly missed you so much Of course, we're drinking pals Of course you'll miss me You're right We're drinking pals Let's go Waiter Yes The check Okay Where are you staying? In a hotel, a rather small room But it's not too bad I'll see you back No, thanks I've just moved in, it's a mess I'll invite you once it's cleaned up I'll go first Seeing how much Bai Ling had changed... ...I was suddenly overcome by a feeling of grief Indeed, last Christmas... ...I was not in Hong Kong 24-Dec-69 Have you seen Miss Su? Miss Su... not for some time Any idea where she might be? Probably back in Phnom Penh I didn't want to spend Christmas 1 969 in Hong Kong So I visited Singapore and went back to the casino I waited for several days but Black Spider never turned up No one knew where she was Some thought she'd gone back to Phnom Penh Others thought she was dead Ping and I began working in Singapore in 1 963 When my life lost most of its meaning... ...I started gambling every day Those were hard times for me And only one person came to my rescue A professional gambler Some said she was a cheat She always wore black They called her Black Spider She kept her black glove on for 365 days of the year Nobody knew why for sure Had her hand been chopped off for cheating? did the glove cover up a fake hand? Nobody really knew Why do you wear that black glove? It's a habit You're not from here? I am from Phnom Penh What a coincidence! I was just in Cambodia The place is in chaos what were you doing there? The newspaper sent me You're a journalist? Not anymore Why's that? They made some changes and I'm now a 'consultant' On half-pay, with next to nothing to do So why are you spending your time in the casino? I tried to win enough to pay my way back to Hong Kong You lost a lot? A few thousand You should never sat foot in a casino in a bad mood You won't win I didn't expect to win I just hoped to get back my stake If you have any left... ...I can help you on one condition When you've got your money back stop gambling Why are you helping me? I take a commission 1 0% of whatever I win for you Think it over What good to her... were her tiny commissions on my winnings After that, we went back to the casino night after night We'd eat at the stall next to the railway station She won back all the money I'd lost! Thank you Don't thank me. It's yours If you need me again tomorrow... ...I'll be waiting here after dinner I still don't know your name It's Su, Su Lizhen A few years ago I fall in love with another man's wife Her name was also Su Lizhen It was because of her that I moved to Singapore I never dreamed I'd meet another Su Lizhen I told her a lot about the other Su Lizhen At first, we kept it secret But gossip soon spread Later we moved into a hotel We had Room 2046 When I think back the whole thing was like a dream You loved her deeply? It's history Let's change the subject You, what did you do before? You want to know about me? Come on, we'll play high-low If you win, I'll tell you everything It struck me that her past... ...was like the hand she always kept gloved A mystery with no solution Of all the men I've met... ...you've been the best to me I'm already missing you Why won't you come with me? Didn't you... ...promise not to ask? Hold me It may be years before we meet again The night we last saw each other for the last time... I told her... take care Maybe one day you'll escape your past If you do, look for me Now it strikes me that what I told her was actually meant for myself In love, you can't bring on a substitute I was looking for what I'd felt with the other Su Lizhen I didn't realize that myself But I'm sure she did When the peony blooms She stands tall And then goes away Does she mean 'No' or 'Yes'? All for me? You want to get me drunk? I know you're a good drinker Let's drink! As much as we can! If there's any left over... ...finish it next time you're here One small thing I have to ask you Here's some money, please take it What for? I know you borrowed from a friend for my plane ticket Pay him back If there's any left, pay my rent for me Where did you get so much money? An old customer He's always been fond of me He treats me well But he's too old for me so I never paid him much attention I ran into him yesterday while I was shopping He insisted on buying me dinner I needed money So I went After dinner, I told him I needed money He said I could have as much as I wanted I told him I needed $5,000 At first I planned to save it for Singapore But I'm using it now Don't be silly You're still young You have great prospects I borrowed the money from my friends They don't need it back yet So keep this for yourself Pay me back later, there's no rush Why are you so kind to me? Perhaps it's fate T oo bad it didn't last I wish it could have gone on longer Don't be like this Let me buy you dinner tonight Waiter, the check! Coming No, let me You're too kind You've spent enough time and money on me already I don't want to owe you too much I need to make a phone call Please settle the check, I'll be outside Will you come in? No, thanks Get some rest I'll see you to the airport tomorrow Please don't I'll be terribly sad if you're there Take good care of yourself Why can't it be like, it was before? Please don't go Stay with me tonight Let me borrow you Do you remember? You once asked me... ...if there was anything I wouldn't lend I've given it a lot of thought And now I know... there is one thing I'll never land to anyone As I recall... ...that was the very last time we saw each other I haven't seen her since that night Why can't it be like it was before? He didn't turn back It was as if he'd boarded a very long train Heading for a drowsy future Through the unfathomable night Everyone who goes to 2046 has the same intention They want to recapture lost memories Because in 2046... ...nothing ever changes But nobody really knows if that's true or not Because nobody has ever come back
