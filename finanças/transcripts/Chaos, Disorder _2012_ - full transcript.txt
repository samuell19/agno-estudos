Who do we target this time? Let's target Toktok. Toktok? Indeed. Don't be surprised. He's sly, but he's no match for us. - Tell you what… - What? - Hand me the rifle. - Here. Let's hit one of Oum Ghada's pigeons. Oum Ghada's pigeons? That goes without saying. You just get yourself ready. Deal. MONDAY - DAWN Faster, Balgham! Or are you here to warm your body? Come take this bottle, boy. We'll head out. Wait a bit. What? You're the one standing in the wrong place. Got a cigarette? Got any cigarettes? Check Toktok's box. You'll find cigarettes there. Find me a lighter. Hand it to him. You cheapskate, why don't you carry a lighter? He likes to smell matches. - Come here, kid! - Me? Good morning. The water truck has arrived, fellas. Back up, girl! I came before you! That's my place! You back up! God curse whoever pushes my jerrican! Let's respect each other instead of cursing one another. Move! God may answer your sinister prayers and doom us all. Out of my way, Soaad. Move it, girl. I said, move! That's how it's done. Someone place a bet already. Two cigarettes. The first to pass will be a fat girl in blue. Want me to hit Mounir's eye? No, aim for Toktok's neck, that son of a fatty. Want to bet on me hitting Manal's belly button? You'd be royalty if you hit one of Oum Ghada's pigeons. One, two, three, four. Test. Okay, here we go. - Don't sell me out! - Every man for himself! - Don't play dumb, Manal. - What do you mean? Are you high? Believe me, I'm second to no one. I'm solid. I'll make you a queen, as good as any movie you've seen. I'm better than anyone on your mind. Don't make me throw myself at your feet. You are indeed high. Why don't you cut it out before my slipper assaults you? Because he has a sad, cracked voice. What use is that talk? It's not like it would bring back my pigeon. That's on you, Oum Ghada. You should've made a meal out of it. - Enough, Toktok. - Okay, Coach. Every day I wake up to a dead pigeon in the cage. What could he possibly do? Bring it to life? Bondok and Nomah knocked over the falafel. Shut it. I've had it with my good-for-nothing brother. He brings me a new problem every day. Take it easy, man. Why the anger? What is it, Coach? Are you worried about me or about the equipment? To hell with the equipment. It's not mine alone. It's yours too. Then cut me some slack. Why so touchy? Who ruffled your feathers out there? Seeing you with her always makes me wonder. You don't look the type. - That girl's playing me, Coach. - That's just devious thinking. No. I'm not stupid. That girl's playing me. And she's playing Mounir. And playing her dad, feigning innocence. She's playing the whole neighborhood! And I'll be damned if I don't expose her in front of her dad! I can save you all that trouble. You know I'm your friend. This girl is not like you say. TUESDAY - MORNING - I want to use the cell, Amm Sayed. - Sure. - No one's answering. - Okay. Hello? How about a pack of cigarettes? What do you want? - Good morning, Haj. - Good morning. - Can I get a pack of Mu'assel? - Sure thing. - No. I won't have it. - But that's too much, Haj. - It's nothing. - I pray to God we never lose you. Goodbye. You know what? I hate the sight of you in the morning. Send me one of your deadbeats, quick. The whole neighborhood must be waiting impatiently for the truck. Here you go, Balgham. Go see what Haj Sayed wants. Balgham. Replace my canister with a new one. It's Haj Sayed's canister. Both of them are Haj Sayed's? One for Haj Sayed and the other for Zaki. Who's got a problem? What's that supposed to mean? Don't egg me on, Mounir. What coach? Stop tripping. Do you think it's just the coach? It's the coach and Zaki and a whole bunch of them. Forget about Zaki. I can handle him. Would Zaki sell out the coach for you? All done. How about another cigarette? You just had one. I swear it fell while I was carrying the canister. How about I give you another one in exchange for a favor? - Agreed. - Carry it for her. Deal. - Just out of chivalry? - He's the chivalrous one. Stay with her till it's replaced and carry it home for her. Is every canister you bring for Haj Sayed? I don't have a say in it! - How many canisters do you have? - Why? One for Haj Sayed and the other for Zaki. But this is yours too? Both are for Haj Sayed. Right, honey? The gas canister truck is here. Why, folks? A queue for men and another for women to prevent harassment! We all remember the incident when Oum Mimi took her slipper to Amm Elwi's head and split it open when he harassed her three years ago. Learn your lesson! Shehta, only one canister per household. Where, man? The two in the front are Haj Sayed's! Shehta, don't forget Haj Sayed's canisters. Two of them! Absolutely. Your wish is my command. Okay, goodbye for now. Hey, Amm Kamal. Viagra is nothing compared to these pills. Sweet. And what do I eat with them? No, take them 15 minutes before eating. - How are you, Amm Kamal? - Hello, princess. What's up with the second canister you sent with Balgham? It's for Oum Hend. Amm Kamal, can you find a buyer for the ice-cream machine? It's of no use here. The buyers are countless. When do you want it gone? Remember, take it before eating. Good morning. How are you, Zaki? Pull up a crate and sit with us. Sorry, I'll pass. I've got laundry to do. Zaki, look at me. - Balgham. - Yes. Take that home and bring the spanner at the gym. Okay. - What? - What's your deal? - What deal? - The deal with the laundry. I need to do my laundry. Because I told you my dad saw your underwear at our house? Or are you playing dumb? Behave yourself, will you? It's enough that I saw you with Mounir and said nothing. Curse your tongue! You dare say that? About me? Stop lying, will you? My eyes burned watching him checking you out! I swear none of that happened! The next song is "On My Mind, My Love," dedicated by Manal Sayed to an unknown person. See? Don't keep me hanging, Zaki. Tell me if you don't want me. But don't spread rumors like that about me. What makes you think you can do this to me? Or is it because I'm over you? Although I'm a girl, I'm a hundred times manlier than you. Then what do you want? You're shouting at me? You want to hit me to feel like a man? Okay, Zaki! Today, Bahari neighborhood team plays Sultan Hussein neighborhood team. Forget about those loser teams and come play for Bahari. You played for Sultan Hussein and conceded four goals. - What good does this bring you? - The same it brings you. Bottom line is, I'm betting on Bahari. Where to? To my cousin Soaad's. Why don't you fill in for me? I have an errand to run. Team Bahari and Team Sultan Hussein meet exclusively this afternoon. We'll bring you the details as they come in, from the ref to the teams' lineups, and we'll have the commentator, Romany. Come in, Haj. The woman swore she wouldn't touch the food till you got here. We're burdening you, Haj Sayed. Did you get the canister? Hend and her mother are thankful. You're all they have. They have you too. How are you, Hend? Come here. God only knows what you mean to us, Haj. Look how the girl is sticking to Haj. Say… Why isn't Abu Ashraf eating? He's been avoiding food since he got his disease. I had my fair share of food, Haj. Light the coal, woman. Wait till she's done eating first. No need to rush. Yes, I mean after she's done. I did nothing, I swear! You think you can get away from me? I swear, I did nothing! - I'll show you. - Let the kid go! I swear, I'm going to string you up! Listen to your brother, you brat! WEDNESDAY - NOON Haitham! Go home. Your mother's looking for you. Do they have nothing but taro? Have at it if you can afford it. - And don't cook taro if you don't like it. - I have to like it. I just hope the vegetable truck isn't any later than this. "I challenge the whole world when I'm with you." A song dedicated by Mounir Mohsen to an unknown person. It's a beautiful song by the artist Saber Al Rebaï. The vegetable truck has arrived. Here's Oum Mustafa's taro recipe. Taro can be made with chard or with red sauce. The steps are as follows. Cut the taro and drop it in the soup with pre-prepared chard, butter, two cloves of garlic and some coriander in addition to leek. Awaiting your feedback. Oum Mustafa Bilya! Oum Mustafa! Where's Ashraf? What do you mean, you can't? That's how it's always been. What do I do? Be patient, fellas! As you wish. See? I've got you covered. This is theft. You're giving out crates left and right, leaving out the poor girl. I told her I'd give her any leftovers. If Haj Sayed's daughter says so, give her two crates! - Fine. - Where to? Here. Not for me to say. I'm afraid if I wait, you'd forget about me. - My man. - My dear taro-filled friend. - Why did you come and leave your dad? - To ask you for Mu'assel. To hell with Mu'assel. Drink up, girl. Don't be silly. Here, drink it. - Here's Abu Ashraf's Mu'assel. - But that's too much. Not at all. And take a vegetable crate on your way. The top crates are the worst. Go ahead. - Bless you. - You too. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Hold your mother's hand. - Did you "finish"? - Finish what? - Finish bringing the two crates. - You're all about women's crowds, huh? What women, Mounir? It's just every week's gig. Tell me, Mounir. Is the needle choosing a thimble? I'm talking about Haj Sayed. - Which thimble is he poking? - Oum Hend. I feel a whole vibe between them. Where are you going? - Off to sell our two crates. - Make sure to do Ghusl. Do you want me to send you a jerrican of water? Your company sucks. Taking it from a bunch of kids? Play, girl. By God, I think there's something wrong with your head. Because you laugh on your own, and then… you cry on your own. And I bet you'll do so now. Stop sounding like your friend. You're both in love with drama. Zaki? He's just an innocent kid. Who's an innocent kid? Zaki? He can burn me to a crisp with a mere look. Damn him. Well, you humiliated him. Take it from me, you'll find no match for him in the whole wide world. The vegetable truck has left. Those who didn't get any will get some next week. THURSDAY - AFTERNOON - What's riding on the match? - Juice. Zaki! Zaki! I told Haj Refaat more than 30 times about this. Go Eagles! Any news? What news? We barely even started. Go Eagles! Go Eagles! There's a goal. How's that for news? Don't play dumb. I'm asking about Manal. Look. He's going crazy. "What a player!" He thinks he's a TV commentator or something. More than 30 times… Go put the wires back properly. He'll add some spice. What's the deal, Soaad? Silence the kid or send him to his dad. Go Eagles! Where were you, Zaki? It's an intense match. Will you play in the next match? Forget it. - Haj. - Don't pester him. Zaki's going to play for team Hilal. And we're back on! Once again, welcome to this important match between Team Eagles, led by Ibrahim Tuna, and Team High Dam, led by Captain… Where's the tea, Menna? High Dam on top! Tell you what, guys. I have an important errand. I'll be back. And the next game, Haj? Team Eagles is solid… Careful! …although luck is not always on its side. My man, the OG. Team High Dam is pushing strong. And I think that its leaders are strong, and love what they do. Make room, Toktok. To hell with me if you want. So yummy. There are no stars in the match. Where's Haj Sayed going with that girl? - How would I know? - Indeed, how would you? Her own pimp of a husband doesn't say a word, so of course you wouldn't. - What's your deal, Manal? - Nothing, Zaki. What's your deal? - Why are you braying? - Me, braying? What are you saying? Flaunting your manhood in public at my expense? In public and in private and in any place! What's your deal? Shut up already! Okay, I'll shut up then. By God, if you were playing, it would've been over already. Whose side are you on, Toktok? - Whichever side you're on. - I'm on your side. Lovely! What will become of me after such sweet talk? I'm not standing, I'm flying. Mr. Airplane, fly off and watch the game elsewhere. - Because I'm powerless, right? - Just go already. Go Eagles! High Dam on top! High Dam on top! Is this to your liking? People will get bored with matches. And if we allow that, we'll lose the payoff. What do you want? Instead of sitting here, dare him to a bet that will be the end of him. Or are you afraid of him? - You should've been called Bee. - Bees make honey. - But they sting. - I'll tell him you're in. Lovely. Want me to split him in half for you? Absolute bad luck for team High Dam. Your pal is so smug, no one can talk to him. - Who's the smug one, Toktok? - Mounir. Tell you what, superstar. How about a bet to shut him up for years? Zaki! Don't listen to him. The snake wants to turn you all on each other. - He's over there. Why not ask him? - Stop it! Why are you so burned up about it? Move it. I'm out, you sly bastard. Meat is riding on the next match, big man. Go Eagles! From here, I see a dangerous attack… - You completely humiliated me. - That's on you. - But when you were angry, you looked... - What? You looked sexy, I swear. Pleasure seeing you. How about a match between you and me? Why so eager? So you'll play? Okay, I'll play. - Winner gets the meat? - I said, okay. When? Set it up and let me know. Here's the juice truck. Where's Haj Sayed to see this spectacle? Juice trucks shouldn't be allowed on the soccer field… FRIDAY - SUNDOWN I don't know why I said that to her. - Did you swear at her? - Not even. All of a sudden, she held the necklace, ripped it off and threw it away. Are you just going to watch? Man, she could be laughing one second and crying the next. And she plays these games in front of anyone! For example, a guy like Toktok could be around, and she'd break into a slutty laugh. We need to renovate this gym. The equipment is barely functional. Are you even listening to me? Have a heart! Why are you evading me? Remember we have a PlayStation match. Look. I'll come back after a while. I say to every lady, you can preserve meat for a whole week. Do you want to know how? You will after this song. Will you play for ten kilos of meat? Twelve. - When will we play? - I'll tell Haj Sayed. Zaki and Mounir agreed on the match, chief. - Did you lose anything? - No. What's that about Mounir? I'm telling you, Zaki and Mounir agreed on the match. - Making deals behind my back? - Nothing of the sort. The guys agreed on a match that can't be played without the chief's permission, chief. You're the chiefly chief! Could a match ever be played without your permission? - Who decided what's riding on the bet? - There's no bet. There's talk of 12 kilos of meat, but people are waiting on your word. There will be 22 kilos riding on this game. Understood? Ten for the winner and two for the referee. And I'll provide the chairs, setup and electricity. And what's your cut, Haj? Ten kilos. And your main man who made it all happen? My main man who made it all happen gets his cut from the winner. Now, scram. I have important business. Today's advice is from Mahmoud Saber Mustafa. "He who digs a hole for his brother, falls in it himself." Been looking for you since yesterday. Where were you, Haj Sayed? - When will you marry and get off my back? - When you get married first. You spent the night where? Why do you make me feel like a cheating husband? I spent the night with my friends, and I didn't want to alarm you. So I came in the morning to open the shop. What's wrong with that? Leave that! Leave the pot here. When the meat comes, I'll send it to your doorstep. Now, shake a leg. Go on, girl! I swear to God, whoever marries you is in for trouble. I told you to get going! Come on, girl! Get up already! Dedicated by Manal to Haj Sayed. An old song, but a nice one, Manal. Meat is very important for humans because it's the source of protein, which is very important for human development. Nothing's better than eating meat! Rub the loofah under your nose and keep at it till it bleeds. But use a good loofah, and you'll find mustache hairs coming out from under the skin. But they won't be thick. Are you going to blow it up or flip it over? If only I would grow a mustache. Finish up! Did the truck arrive? Not yet. Whose mustache do you envy, Bondok? It's full of nails now. What will you do with it? You're running away? How come when it's my idea, you idiot? - Where to? - To your mom's. Say what? If you get into any more trouble, I'll break your bones! How are you, Coach? Stop it! Get off me. - Let's have a look. - Stop already! Will you play me? - I'm leaving. - Where to? Why did you stop? Get up. Get up, girl. What are you doing there? What are you doing? Speak up! - What's up, Coach? - Hey. - What's up with Bondok? - I don't know, and it's pissing me off! - Let go. - Speak! Have you seen Zaki? I saw Zaki a while ago. Don't hit him. - Have a heart. - Fine. Okay. I'll let him off the hook. Oh, I thought you were working. - Manal is with Mounir. - How did the game go? Are you ignoring me? Look, Coach, I don't care about those who don't care about me. Do you think I'm going to screw Mounir just because he's seeing Manal? You love her. Oum Ghada is on fire! Fire! Fire at Oum Ghada's house, folks! Everyone, please proceed to put out the fire and evacuate the children. Let us know if Oum Ghada's well! Belal! The meat truck's here. What's this? The meat truck's on fire too! No, folks! We've been hit by the evil eye! That lowlife, pretending he's a man. Are you going to let this pass, Mounir? I swear you're the root of all our problems. Who do you mean? I just mean Haj Sayed Arabie, Manal's father. By God, I can burn down his shop for you. We really are pushovers who deserve to be fooled if a bastard like that can steal our meat wager from us. Why are you so worked up? Because I don't like getting screwed and taking it like you do, Mounir. - And who's screwing you, Toktok? - Haj Sayed, man. Hold up. - Hold up, boy. - Stop. You thieving bastard. You set fire to Oum Ghada's place and punctured the tires to steal meat? - Hands off, or I'll call my brother! - I'll call him myself. - Where are you taking this meat? - Summon the coach. Tell him Bondok torched the house, blew the truck's tires and stole the meat. No, Mounir. We're going to take the meat and let them go. Bondok and Adham are like sons to us. I'm willing to let him go with the meat in exchange for a favor. You see Haj Sayed's shop over there? I want you to get me something from there. SATURDAY - NIGHT Stop. My brother's coming. Balgham. Oum Mounir sent you this cup of tea. Why did you think of painting the room? Talk some sense into him, Balgham. I just felt like it. Hang out the laundry to dry. It's not like it's going to rot, Mom. Damn you both. Tell me, Mom, why is my brother Mounir painting the room? His mother is rich, and he has his father's inheritance. I'll get the ladder in a sec. Where's that laundry you want me to hang? - Don't be long. - Yes, Mom. I got you two hot movies full of clean-shaven women. - It's just soft-core stuff. - Not at all. Just take it. There's biting and humping right off the bat. A song dedicated from Ola and Shaimaa to their friend Mona on the occasion of her seventh birthday, which we're all celebrating. Mohamed Hassan congratulates chief Ashraf on his new baby, Hamada. The sip and see is in two days. Sarah sends greetings to Waleed and wishes him the best. Congratulations on Wafaa's engagement to Saeed. Here's to the big night. Daddy Essam and Mommy Suheir congratulate Pakinam on quitting the pacifier. I didn't get like this until my second kid. But you're bottom-heavy, Soaad. Soaad's not bottom-heavy. She has muffin tops. You forget how Shawkiya was before marriage. Shawkiya who? She's always been ugly, married or not. Ugly? You're the ugly one. Hey! Manal forgot her basin. - Hi, Nadia. - Here, you ditz. You forget everything. - Thanks. - Don't be like my sister Soaad. - What's that smell? What are you burning? - Butt out, girl! Whatever I'm burning or not burning is none of your business. Here you are, pampering yourself. What pampering? I just did my eyebrows. What? Something wrong with that? Just your eyebrows? Your legs are all shiny. Yeah, right. You already brought the basin, so you can go now. Please. I just want to groom my eyebrows. Girl, I don't want any problems with your sister, okay? Know who I saw? I saw Zaki. I just saw him with Shahinda, daughter of Yehiya, the barber. Just groom my eyebrows a little. What's this crap? What's wrong with you? Turning this into a waxing parlor! - What's this madness? - What's the deal? No one came near you. You want to wax all over the place while I just shut up about it? Have a little respect! By the way, this isn't the first time. But it's the first time you get upset. Fine. When you have your own house, do whatever you want with it. Even if it's turning it into a brothel! What's this crap? It's not waxing that turned you on me like this. Must be something else. It's not decent what you're doing with that little girl. What's wrong? I have enough troubles. I don't need you on my case right now! Do tell. I lost my cell phone. And I'm mad with anger, so just stay away from me, girl! - Stay away! - Okay. Good luck finding that cell phone you're looking for. Hi. And what is this crap you've done to yourself? What? Don't you like it? Isn't it better than that other girl? Yehiya, the barber's daughter? Shahinda? I've neither seen nor met her. You poor thing. I feel sorry for you. - Then how come you were holding hands? - Who? Where? When was this? Play innocent. Go ahead, have at it. Play innocent? Who told you this? Unbelievable. Manal, don't make a scene. Why the tears, now? I'm crying over my misfortune. I don't know what you see in her. I swear she hooked up with the entire neighborhood. I care for no Shahinda, girl. Have you gone crazy, girl? Are you tripping or what? Wait till I drag her by the hair in front of her house, throw her at my feet and have her begging for mercy. Damn you both! I swear to God, I neither saw Shahinda nor met her. Manal, don't bust my chops. I've got enough troubles already. You give me nothing but grief. I'm the one getting her chops busted. I just had a huge fight at home with my dad. - Why? - He lost his phone or something. He's become unbearable since then. And how did he lose his phone? Perhaps he dropped it? Look, Manal. - I want you. - Zaki! SUNDAY - NIGHT Other than that, there are many miracles. For example, the cow that birthed a puppy. Nothing is in our hands. Good evening. Good evening, Manal. Where's Haj Sayed? I came and didn't find him, so I'm resting my legs. And in nature are wondrous forms of mountains. - How are you, Oum Hend? - Can't complain. - And how's Hend? - She's good. - And Abu Ashraf? - He's fine. - What's your deal? - I have a splitting headache. Just keeping my eyes open hurts. Did you take any medication? I've taken every pill there is, but nothing works. I don't know where that man disappears to. I'll go look for him. A rug has blown off or been stolen from Magdy's. We're not accusing anyone. Do inform him if you find it or know something about it. And there's a plastic mat gone from Oum Yehiya's balcony. After tomorrow, Sameh and Haj Fathi's daughter - will say their vows. - What brings you here? What brings you here? I'm out searching for you. Off you go. Go home. Oum Hend awaits you at the shop. The guys are at odds over the timing of the match. Some say today and some say tomorrow afternoon. Look, I don't have time for this nonsense. Scram! People are waiting for the chief's word, chief! Is this really necessary? Why the fuss? He told you he'll cover all costs. Haj Sayed. I've brought them all to you before someone drops dead tonight. I told you I'll take care of everything. Will you go big or go home? Let's hear it from the chief. Look, Mounir wants to play the match with Team Challenge tonight. - And Zaki wants to delay it till tomorrow. - Why not wait till tomorrow, Mounir? - We'll play in the morning light. - I want to play this very night. Lighting and all preparations are on me. All from my own pocket. He'll have it all on a silver platter. I swear you need someone to... Hey, Coach! Respect! Let's keep it decent, people. We're in the chief's presence. It's a soccer game, not pro wrestling. Do us a favor and stay out of it. It's okay, Coach. It's okay. That's you showing them you're a man? Some man you are. Have some respect, the both of you! Are we in a gutter or what? Now listen up. I will not tolerate any more of this hooliganism. I'm the chief of the neighborhood. If you have some money you're dying to spend, why not spend it on your mother and sister? The costs of the match are on me. Equipment, chairs and electricity. Now, off you go! And come back in an hour with your team to play this match, whether you like it or not. No, Haj Sayed! You let him have his say! Whose say, Zaki? He's a hooligan. He has no say. Fine. Today is no different than tomorrow. Toktok! Stop by Refaat, the electrician, and Abu Nabil, the equipment renter. And go by Mr. Sedky too, to be the referee of the match. Sedky's daughter is getting circumcised. Tell Abu Heba. He's even better than Sedky. And tell him the referee gets a kilo of meat! Blue is the color of sadness. Red is the color of love. Green is the color of prosperity, while yellow is the color of jealousy. - And white is the color of… - Don't film me! Mounir, the prince, cutting through the defense. That was sweet how you played them, man. And your buddy sitting behind the desk almost trembling, some lion he is. But just so you know, had I not saved you from the coach's hands, - he would've bashed your face in. - Where to? I'm going to summon Refaat, the electrician. You know what? I swear I was dying to tell Haj Sayed… The sweets truck has arrived! The sweets are in! Refaat's truck is here! And riding on its cab is Toktok, dynamo of the hood and lover of the sport. Haj Sayed. What now? Is there anything else? I love you, Haj Sayed, more than my own father. What's your deal? Are you possessed by a devil or a fever? - For you to show such disrespect. - Dare I disrespect the chief? Stay away from the coach, or he'll kill you. No one can touch me. As long as I'm under the protection of the chief, Haj Sayed. I'm your man, Haj Sayed. You can't see me, that's all. Look, Mounir. Our contact ends with this match. Win or lose, you'll get out of my hair. Why, Haj Sayed? I can do something for you. Something only I can do. Mounir, Mom wants me to tell you that the guy from the sweets truck never gives me the full ration, so get it yourself. The cell phone you want with the video on it... I can bring it to you right now. Two kilos of mishabik! Don't just give me a piece or two! But on the condition that we play the match. - If I lose, you take the cell. - And if you win? You still get the cell phone, but I get Manal. Me? Giving you my daughter? Zaki may win anyway. I swear to you, Haj Sayed, this stays between us. No one will know about it. Not even Manal. You think I'll sell you out, huh? But I swear to you, Haj Sayed, I love you. And I wouldn't want our chief to be scandalized. Now chill out and put your hand in mine. I beg of you. I've painted the room, and it's all set. I have a good heart, and I will take good care of Manal. The cell will be yours after the match. Hey, you! Go get a chair for Haj Sayed! What's the matter, Haj? You were fine a while ago. What is it? What did he tell you? By God, I'll mess him up for you. Say something, Haj. My cell phone was stolen. It has something personal on it. - Mounir wants to change the bet. - What does that mean? Five on Team Challenge, Toktok. Good call. My boy Toktok, four on Team Hope. It's Uncle Toktok to you, boy. Team Hope is hopeless. - Toktok. Three on Team Challenge. - Attaboy. Challenge! - Want me to kill him for you? - So the whole thing blows wide open? God is giving me cover, and you want to blow it. He's a son of a bitch, that boy. If you kill him, everything will be revealed to the whole neighborhood. Who knows? Maybe Zaki will win and cover my ass. Okay, but he might also lose, Haj. Anyone worried about getting hurt can go home! Take it easy. Hey! Stop! Ladies and gentlemen! A very good evening to you all. An evening we've been awaiting for years. Everyone's invited to the big soccer game between Team Challenge, led by Mounir, and Team Hope, led by Coach Zaki. If you're sitting in the third-class seats, Team Hope will be to your left, and Team Challenge will be to your right. Oh, how I miss such matches and lovely evenings! Coach Zaki with the kickoff. I can see that his spirits are very high. Zaki! What a player! Advance! Mounir's getting close. Even closer. What will he do? Zaki's advancing. Zaki still advancing. What's he going to do? What's he going to do? Tell me the truth, Manal, by your father, Haj Sayed, whom do you cheer for? Toktok! Are you going to sit quietly or scram? Challenge! The boy's playing with one eye on you. - Which boy's that? - Don't play dumb. Of course it's Zaki! Team Hope! - Why, Zaki? - What's this? What luck, Zaki! I told you! Shut up, or I'll bury your head in the field! Here goes Zaki. Will he do it? He's moving forward… And he scores! Zaki did it! Zaki did it after the second attack of the game. What a player! Team Hope! See what Oum Hend's gone and done? You could say the devil got the better of her. Go ahead, Haj Sayed. Ask her daughter. She was sitting there, totally fine. Then she poured kerosene on herself, wanting to set herself on fire. - I swear the devil got the better of her. - Fix us some refreshments. Hend, come so you can get me a packet of tea. What now? Are you going to blow this wide open? I told you not to film, but you wouldn't listen. You know what? I should've never told you that I lost the cell phone. I told you so. Oh, Lord, what will become of me? We'll get the cell phone back, for sure. My word is final. Tonight, after the match, you'll have the cell and burn it yourself. - How about that? - It's too late. Whoever saw it already did, and I've been scandalized! What brings you here? Go watch the game! Scram! Team Challenge! Mounir advances. More and more. - Where's Haj Sayed gone to? - He's at our house. - Where's your dad? - My dad's at home. Mounir getting close. What's he going to do? He's done it! Mounir's done it! Scored the ball from far off. Smacked it into the net! What a player! Mounir Mohsen... What a player! Summon Haj Sayed. Tell him to come quick. The game is almost over. He told me to come watch it. I'm telling you to go call him! What's there to understand? Why don't you settle down, girl? In and out of the house all day. I was watching the game when Manal told me to go call Haj Sayed because people were fighting in the match. She's not going to sleep for a second until you come back. I know her well. Come back later, Haj. And I'll set up a hookah for you. Mounir, the prince, cutting through the defense! Mounir, the prince, cutting through the defense! The penalty is correctly called, and the kick will be taken. Hamdy Orany tackled Mounir when he was advancing to score. Right in the penalty area. I'm sure you'll ask me if a penalty kick can be taken in extra time. Sure. If he scores, Team Challenge wins. If not, we'll proceed with this nerve-racking match. Somebody get a doctor! - Coach! - Give him air! Make room, people! MONDAY - DAWN Subtitle translation by: Noura Hassan
