[People Chattering] Hyah! Hyah! [Quiet Grunting] Hyah! [Grunting Continues] [Keys Rattling In Lock] Hyah! [Water Dripping] [Metal Gate Opens] Hyah! [Footsteps Approaching] You're Bolt? Jefferson Bolt? Very good. I'm impressed. But I don't have all day. Come on now. [Grunting] Ask me what I want. Hyah! You'll tell me. You've been here a week. You wanna go for two? There are two kinds of people in the world: those who want things done and those who run errands. You're an errand boy. That much I know. So get it done. You want to get out of here? Yes or no? Coax me. All right, then, Bolt. Let's move it. [Ship Horn Blowing] [Children Laughing] [Laughing Grows Louder] Your friend's here. He'll like your apartment. I live in a four-by-two hotel room myself. Guess it pays pretty good being a professional courier. This place must set you back 7,000 or 8,000 Hong Kong dollars a month, at least. [Doorbell Buzzes] Right? Wrong. I own the building. Perhaps you know who I am. Yeah, you iced me into that Chinese cooler. I forget what charge was invented. Something about, um, assault on a police officer I never saw. Well, you should have pleaded innocent, old boy. I did, old boy. Six or seven times a day for nearly a week. Well, it's over now, and there's money in it, good deal of money. Well, enough to ease the pain, as I'm sure you've been told. Well, take the bloody thing, man. Was that necessary? He's a pretty tough cookie. [KeyJangles] He poked me in the teeth with a.38, said he'd make me eat it. [Key Rattling In Lock] I wasn't hungry. - [Both Grunting] - All right, Carter. Stop fooling about. I haven't got all day. [Moans] Ooh. Now it's your turn. Out. Not until I tell you why I've gone to all this trouble. Well, I'm gonna take a shower, so you don't have much time to capture my interest. How about $20,000? U.S. dollars. Any currency you want. Doin' what? You're a professional courier, one of the two or three best in the world, it says here. Interpol report: "Jefferson Bolt. "Six years carrying special shipments, Africa to Rome, Amsterdam, London, New York. Three attempts to take you." Four. Let's see what the Americans have to say on you. "Maintains homes London, Los Angeles, Hong Kong and Paris. "Six trips to Las Vegas in the past year. Business and pleasure." Some of it's rather racy, old boy. "Captain, U.S. Special Forces, "Graduate of Cal Tech. Masters Degree, M.I.T., physics. "Holder of the black belt. "Known to have killed three men, Rio deJaneiro, 1969. "Self-defense. "Now working as a courier, bonded and licensed, "specializing in currency, high-value items. Listed as dangerous, to be watched." Like to know what the British have on you? I've seen it. Same old scam. Don't be modest. Yes, you're absolutely the right man. Yeah? For what? Carrying a million, U.S. currency, Hong Kong to Mexico Cityvia Los Angeles. Leaving Wednesday. Why all that muscle and a week in that crappy tank? Call it insurance. A little time was needed to get things together. Besides, we thought it might be healthy if you knew where the power was... and what it would mean if you said no, old boy. You're a real giggle, old boy. Oh, you'll do it. Believe me, you will. That week we hadyou stashed away had a lot of thinking behind it. It gave us a chance to look, amongst other things. In the hat, old boy. You learn something new every day. I know more about this apartment than you do. Of course, it took a metal detector at the end to do it. You had to have a special safe someplace, a place to keep things that you didn't want found, like papers and records and extra passports. Three of them. Various names, various countries. Very illegal. Now that we understand each other, I won't need this anymore, will I? And you, of course, will want your passport. Oh, your legal passport. Oh, incidentally, we extracted this from your mail... the day we put you away. It's from the International Banking Agency, a Mr. Martin. He mentions a shipment to go by courier... which will turn out to be that million dollars. Wouldyou be interested? You, of course, will sayyes. Ifyou wantyour illegal bits and pieces back, whatever he says, you'll do it. Money make you nervous, Mr. Martin? This much, anyway. I wasn't expecting you to be with anyone. I'm with the American Consulate, Mr. Martin. Customs Service. I'll have to seal that up so our friend here won't be held up on the other end, after we register the money, of course. We prefer to do this in our office. Bringing me to the bank was his idea. He scares easy. Anything wrong with that? No, I just wasn't expecting anyone. Excuse me. Five packs this way, three the other. Yes, sir. It'll fit perfectly. [Customs Man] It's really quite simple, Mr. Martin. We just make a record of the serial numbers, that's all. I'll need receipts from both ofyou. All four copies where it's marked. Well, that just about does it. A lot of good that'd do you, if somebody really wanted it. True. All the cuffs are supposed to do is slow things down while somebody saws off my hand. [Intercom Buzzes] Yes? [Woman] Mr. Martin from the bank is on the line, sir. He says it's urgent. This is Mr. Kumada. What is it, Martin? It's about that man Bolt, sir. He had a United States Customs official with him. He registered the money. He did what? I couldn't help it, Mr. Kumada. [Kumada] That's all right, Martin. I'll take care ofit. When does Bolt arrive in Los Angeles? [Martin] Noon tomorrow. Pan American Flight 846. Flight 846. Wouldyou like me to contact our people in Los Angeles? I said I'll take care of it! I'll take care of everything. [Airplane Engine Roaring] [Tires Screeching] [Woman On P.A. System] A ttention, please. All passengers arriving on Pan American Flight 846... from Hong Kong, please claim baggage in customs area-- They called from the field. What is it this time, the Hope diamond? All passengers must clear immigration. Why don't you just paint a sign on me, George? Sorry about that. Lost my head. Welcome to Los Angeles. I just carry corporation papers nowadays. Pays less, but it lasts longer. I'll have to check your luggage. I sent it through yesterday. Well, that's it then. He's got to be tall and dark, especially dark. Oh. Thank you. My pleasure. [Woman On P.A. System Announcing Flights] Hello? Hey-- Hey, Mary? Yeah, this isJames. I'm fine. I just got a new car! Yes, ma'am. I-- How? My welfare check, it came in. It's a pretty car too. White on white. Yes, ma'am. [Chuckles] [Woman On P.A. System] Mr. Bolt to the information desk, please. Mr. Bolt to the information desk. Mr. Bolt to the information desk. - Would you move aside, sir? Just over a little bit? - Who, me? - Yes, sir, just a little bitty bit. - When I'm ready, buster! Want to move by yourself, fat boy, or you want me to move you? Okay, DeVargas, move it. You are-- Yes, of course you are. Listen-- You send my baggage on to Mexico City? It's in the car. What are they doing in the car? There's been a change of plan. [Gasping] Hey! Talk fast. What change of plans? We are taking delivery here instead of there. What do you care? I care, friend. A change means trouble. [Man] You got it. Don't move too fast, black boy. They said he had the key to the cuffs somewhere. Take a look. Your friends in Mexico know about this? Just let's have it, then we walk away. Nobody gets hurt. I got it. Hold that up where I can get at it. Ain't he nice? Ohh! Hyah! Charming. - Hyah! - [Crashing] [Toilet Flushing] Don't forget to wash your hands. I'm sorry, mister. Resident parking only. Hey, Mr. Bolt. I didn't recognize you. Hi, Walter. I ain't seen you in a couple of months. Why don't you park this thing for me, bring my car down. Oh, hey, your car's down already. Oh? I brought it down when your friends came by asking for you. What friends? They're right up there in the car waiting for you. - Get down, quick! - [Gunshots] [Tires Screeching] [Gunshots Continue] [Horn Honking] [Horn Honking] [Sustained Honk] Charming. [Bell Dinging] I'd like to rent a car. Bring it back when I'm finished with it. About a week. [Horn Honks] [Man Talking, Faint] - Who do you want? - Connie Mellis. - What do you want to see him about? - He'll know when I tell him. Tell me. You're new here, okay. You don't know me. That's okay too. But you're getting in my face, man. It's gonna get worse, nigger. You hear me? Understand that? [Yells] Difficult to get it like that, isn't it? And if you do, I'll break off your thumb. Let's go see Connie. Maybe he'll give you a raise. Now, you push it. Push it. [Groaning] [Buzzing] Hey,Jeff. Connie. Tell this muscle here not to lean on me. Mickey, take it easy. I'm gonna hold still for that? He's family. Anyway, he'd take you. Sit. Elaine, this isJeff Bolt, a friend of mine. Put him in the V.I.P. suite, all right? Anything he wants. Anything at all. Forget it. He's wired. Hey, Sam's still here. Yeah, I saw it on the marquee. Hmm, I always get the fat ones. Sorry about Mickey. I didn't know you were in town or I'd have left word. I'm getting a little uptight about being muscled. What idiot would put the muscle on you? I was set up by somebody here in Vegas, somebody from Casino Enterprises. Looks like I struck a nerve. Casino Enterprises owns 40% of this joint, but that's all. Nobody owns 40% of me, and what that bunch does has nothing to do with anything. Hey, Connie. I didn't think it came from you. This is what they're after. What's that? A big one, in hundreds. - [Whistles] - Heavy, huh? Maybe too heavy. No, no. I'll take a reading as quiet as I can. But you're hustling the house man. He's theirs. He looks over my shoulder. He'll know you're in town, so anything I can do for you has got to be fast. You can run a scan on this from your money room. Got an idea about it. Camp? [Man] Yeah, boss? Round up Eddie and all his equipment. Make it fast. I knew it. I knew it. The serial numbers-- They were put on by a different machine. It's phony, the whole thing, but real class. It would get by a bank, but not me anymore, not once I've spotted it. He ever make a mistake? All he does is sit in that cash room, watching the bills go by. Right, Eddie? I got three to ten in Folsom for thinkin' I was this good with a burin. Well, I wasn't this good. Best I ever saw. Much obliged. Good night, Eddie. See you. Well, it adds up. Does it? I just got a phone call about you. Oh? You turnin' me over? They didn't even ask. The guy I talked to's got the shakes about you. I said, "All the man wants is to get paid. Pay the man, you get your stuff." Do you know what he said to me? He couldn't care less if you ate it.

Ooh, ain't it? How you been keeping yourself, Sam? Bad-tempered and depraved. Does that scare you? I'll take my chances.

Damn your beautiful brown eyes. You really know, don't you? - Pay 19. - One of these days I'm gonna turn you off, cut you loose, if it's the last thing I do. I don't think so, Sam. You can't.

[Sam Chattering, Laughing] [Laughing Continues] [Chattering, Laughing Grows Louder] - [Sam Grunts] - [Glass Shatters] [Glass Shatters] [Gasps] [Body Falls] It's your turn, friend. - You got it wrong,Jeff. - Don't hand me that jive, Connie. I spread that funny money all over the casino, waitin' on your expert to blow the whistle. Not a peep out of him. That stuff about putting the serial number on separately, that's the way it's always done. - That stuff is real. - It's not my action,Jeff. I take it whichever way it comes, but Sam wasn't in the deal. What's with Sam? She's dead, wasted, just like you're gonna be. Get up. In my business,Jeff, it doesn't pay to have friends. I'm sorry about Sam. Any ideas? Yeah. It was DeVargas. I knew... he was in on this. He's connected with some high-powered group in Hong Kong. You fouled him up-- something about registering the money... so it could be traced. What about Casino Enterprises? They're out of it. They were supposed to trickle the money across the table for a commission. Then they got scared off. That's all I could find out before they used me for a punching bag. Sorry about your face, Connie. Well, it wasn't much before. Anyway, I'm still alive, so far. We'll stay that way as long as I got this. Jeff. What do I say if they decide to put the boot to me again? Where will you be? I'm gonna even it up for Sam. [Bolt] Tell 'em I'll be in Hong Kong. I want them to know where I am and what I'll be doing, so they'll come looking for me. That way, I'll find them. [Phone Rings] [Typing] [Traffic Noises, Horn Honking] Sorry to keep you waiting. It's taken some time to inquire into the, uh, extraordinary circumstances you outlined. - Cut it short. I'm in a hurry. - We checked with Mr. Foster at the American Consulate. He confirmed your story. A transaction such as you described did take place... between you and our Mr. Martin. It, uh, doesn't appear in our records, however. Therefore, it was not bank business. Presumably, Mr. Martin was dealing with you privately, a matter which is strictly prohibited. I get this feeling, and it's building up fast, that Mr. Martin's health has gone downhill since I saw him last. His body was recovered from Victoria Peak last Saturday. The coroner's verdict was accidental death. You can understand how grieved we all are. Yes, of course. And I suppose that lets the bank out? A slight correction, Mr. Bolt. The bank has never been in. You're in, all right, right up to your distinguished British ass. You can tell whoever you're working for that they can deal with me directly... or get left behind. Good-bye. [Tires Screech] [Doors Closing] What took you boys so long? Ooh! [Groans] [Groans, Grunting] [Groans] [Groaning Continues, Gasping] [Groaning Continues] What's happening, Doc? As you see, Mr. Bolt, the art of acupuncture can also cause great pain. It's all a matter of knowing where to place the needle. Just don't get blood on my pants, Doc. [Grunting] [Loud Grunt, Panting] Now tell us where the money is, Mr. Bolt. - Aah! - [Bolt Yells] [Gagging] Yaah! [Pounding On Door] Sorry. We're closed. [Pounding Continues] Hyah! [Yells] [Groans] [Fireworks Whistling, Explosions Continue] [Whistling Continues] [Loud Explosions] Charming. Morning. [Speaking Chinese] Chen Kwo. Now that's real good. That's real good, old boy. Where do you learn all these clever dodges? Okay, friend, what is it? The man in the bowler hat, he wants to see you. Well, it's about time. I've been makin' loud enough noises all over Hong Kong. You got your car keys with you? Yeah. Why? I need a lift. Is that it over there? Uh, yeah. Hey, listen! Wait, listen! Hey, open the door. Come on. You're holdin' me up, man. I said he wants to see you. He told me not to come back without you. Hey, don't get all shook. I wanna see him too. You know where Ho Man Tin Hill Road is? Well, that's where I'll be for the next hour. 157 Ho Man Tin Hill Road. 157 Ho Tin Man-- No, no, no. Ho Man Tin Hill Road. Ho Man Tin Hill Road. Good fellow. Ho Man Tin Hill Road. Ho Man-- Hey! Hey, that's my car! [Bell Ringing In Distance] [Clearing Throat] Gentleman wish bath of thousand pleasures? Uh, no. I was told I'd find a friend here. An American, tall. - Ah, chocolate man is so. - Well, I wouldn't call him that myself. He says all right to call him chocolate man. Chocolate with nuts, he says. That's the one. You wait. I'll tell him. [Chattering] - You are wanted. - [Speaking Chinese] [Speaking Chinese] [Speaking Chinese] [Screeching] [Screeching] [Laughing] Chocolate man says you come. [Giggling] What the devil are you doing? What is it? Now look here. I'm here on business and not that kind of business either. Now just cut this out. Help! Help! Oh! [Speaking Chinese] [Women Giggling] Oh, help! You really tried to drop me in a bowl of chop suey, didn't you, friend? You did that when you brought your friend from the embassy in to register the money. - After that, it was easy to trace. - That's beside the point. You introduced me to this ball game in the first place. Is DeVargas one of your flunkies? Hardly. Anyway, it's "was," isn't it? Seems he was found among the dirty linen. He'd been machine washed several times. I don't suppose that's news to you, is it? Is your Cantonese fluent enough to tell Mrs. Godzilla here I don't really need this? [Chuckles] Somehow I don't think she'd believe me. Very amusing. I hope you keep your humor when I tell you... the airport baggage room was broken into and robbed, top to bottom. So was my apartment. I tell you, nothing is safe nowadays. Someone is interested in a certain courier case you brought here with you. A lot of unpleasant people know that you're back. I'm afraid you're in for a rather hard time of it, old boy. Now he tells me. [Yells] [Speaking Chinese] A massage a day keeps the wrinkles away. What do they do here, sandpaper the rest? I understand you wanted to see me. What do you want to talk about? What do you know about a place called Ch'en Fu? Yeah, yeah. It's a, uh-- a island off the coast. They have a Buddhist monastery there where I, uh, studied the, uh, ancient arts of self-defense. - Why? - Well, it seems they've corrupted the arts a bit. Now it's a school for killers, training assassins from all over the world. Do you hear me? Hello. I say, are you there? Uh, yeah. I hear it's run by a former old monk. [Grif ths] It's a throwback to the Samurai system apparently. Once you hire them, pay their price, they carry out any assassination they're assigned to. While we can't be absolutely certain, it seems as though someone's gone to a great deal of trouble to hire a killer from Ch'en Fu, and the target is you. [Grunting] [Speaking Chinese] Spider. I'm rather curious to see who they're going to get to do the job on you. Well, just stick around, friend, and we'll both find out. By the way, what became of the money? Money? Oh, yeah. I spent it. Would it make you a little more cooperative if I told you who I am? I already know, friend. You're government. I've known from the beginning. The only question is, which government? The one that's interested in the money you spent. Would you like to know where it came from? I don't give a damn where it came from. Good. It came from all over Asia. Black market, bribery, prostitution. A little at a time until there was over 10 million in nice, clean $100 bills... with only a little of the original stink left on it. That much we know. There was more. Was? There were other couriers, including one of our own, who was found in the water off Macao recently. You were the lucky one. You came back. No thanks to you. And you can shove all that jive about bein' lucky. All I want to know from you is one thing: Who am I after? I suppose I could tell you that if you were working with us. No deal. I don't care whether you're C.I.A., C.I.D... or just plain c-o-p. No deal. A target. That's all I want from you. In your own words, old boy, no deal. But if you work with us, things could be different. [Chuckling] Well, thanks for the offer, but I don't need the work. Oh! Ah. I can't imagine why they call that the bath of a thousand pleasures. It must've killed more Chinese than the black plague. Think it over. The long knives are out for you right now. And your chances of survival are pretty slim, going it alone. You need friends. Even bad ones, like me. Good day. [Door Opening] [Grunting] [Ship Horn Blowing] [Bolt] Makes for very interesting reading, doesn't it? Especially the fact that one name keeps popping up: Kumada. He's one of the wealthiest merchants in the Orient, besides being a very respected banker and ship owner. There are two of his tankers in the harbor now in quarantine. Why quarantine? Oh, merely a safety precaution. Both tankers are carrying full cargoes... of strategic chemicals from the United States. Nitrous oxides. That kind of thing. Explosives. I'm told they're harmless enough... as long as you keep the oxides, or whatever they are, separate. But you mix that tanker with that one-- Half the harbor goes up. Precisely. Sounds like a very heavy case. He's a product of theJapanese occupation of China. A born survivor. He survived the Chinese Revolution, the conquest of Manchuria, finally got out through Korea with most of his wealth intact. Obviously, Mr. Bolt, he's a man ofgreat power. Great power, indeed. Okay, Governor, you've been leading up to something. When do I get to meet this illustrious character? Oh, this was delivered to your apartment this afternoon. I-I took the liberty of bringing it over. You're invited to a reception and dinner given by Kumada this evening. 8:00, black tie. Oh, I'm invited, too, along with half the Colony. ♪♪ [Jazz] [Man] Ah, good evening. [Man #2] Good evening, Mr. Kumada. This is my wife. So glad you could come. Mr. Bolt, of course. I was beginning to think you might not come. I'm Kumada. I have anticipated our meeting. Then let us take a moment to get better acquainted. Please follow me. This way, Mr. Bolt. We won't be disturbed here. I understand you were victimized in some way by an executive-- a former executive-- of the International Bank. Your bank. That fact is not generally known, Mr. Bolt. Very well. I'll keep it quiet. Do you have reason to believe I was in any way connected with your difficulties? That's a good question. Were you? [Chuckling] I enjoy your spirit, Mr. Bolt. I'm not often bearded in my own den, so to speak. Perhaps if I were to show you something-- This is a report on Andrew Martin, the man you had dealings with at the bank. It's from the police. He was deeply involved in some sort ofinternational ring. Counterfeiters, no doubt. That would make it neat and tidy. Yes. Those bills were found on his body, as a matter of fact. Very clumsy work. Apparently you were given a rather large consignment of those bills to take to Mexico. That was the general idea. And what, may I ask, became of the, uh, shipment? What does it matter, if it was counterfeit? Oh, not as money, of course. But my bank is indirectly involved through Mr. Martin. It might become embarrassing. No need to worry, Mr. Kumada. - It won't be found. - You destroyed it? Now, would I wanna be caught carryin' an armload of counterfeit currency? No, indeed. No, I don't suppose you would. Well, then, the matter seems to be closed. No, not quite. You see, I haven't been paid yet. [Laughing] You're quite a remarkable character. Quite. Your bank is involved. Indirectly, of course. It might become "embarrassing," I think you said. I will certainly give the matter thought. No doubt I will decide that you should get what you deserve. You've come at precisely the right time. Tomorrow night will be the Chinese New Year. The time when what is due must be paid. You are familiar with our customs, I see. Especially that one. Before the new year, all debts have to be settled. I always pay my debts, Kumada, in full. ♪♪ [Continues] Excuse me. [Woman Laughing] Oh, no. [Laughing Continues] Dominique Kuan, one of Hong Kong's most prized possessions. Or should I say, one of Kumada's most prized possessions. I'm told he's extremelyjealous. Oh, there you are, Miriam. I've been looking for you everywhere. Oh, thank you, darling. I haven't been looked for for 20 years. Come along, they're having a duel in the garden. Oh. I understand you're a student of karate, Mr. Bolt. Would you care to participate? No, thanks. I have, uh, other plans for the evening. Hyah! She has no liking for blood sports. O-Oh, yeah. Spider. Hyah! [Grunting] He is good, I think. Very good. - One of the best, if he lives. - We all might say that, Mr. Bolt. Spider is your best pupil, is he not? There is only one man who is better. The best student I ever had, his name... is Bolt. Of this, as Master, I am certain. Spider does not agree. Thus, it becomes a matter of honor. He would rather die than lose. [Moaning Pleasurably] [Moaning Continues] [Door Opens, Closes] [Car Engines Starting] Knowing you is extremely bad for my heart. [Chuckles] By the way, you missed a fabulous meal. No, I didn't. - Is he here? - What is it? [Dominique] What is it? Now, read! Read what it says! It says, "Happy New Year." [Speaking Chinese] Spider! Spider! [Grunting] Hay! Hee! Hyah! [Grunting] Hyah! Yeah, yeah! [Screaming] Is this the way of a Ch'en Fu Master? I thought I was to be honored only by the best of fighters. [Ambulance Siren Wailing] Another time, another place, my brother, if you are willing. [Water Running] [Speaking Chinese] [Speaking Chinese] You've got a lot of nerve coming up here. How'd you find me? Oh, that was easy. I just asked people on the street... where the most beautiful lady in Hong Kong lives, and they said here. And here I am. Liar. Yeah, that's true. That never was one of my strong points. What do you want? Just more. After what you did! That was very naughty of you to do that. You know, he threw me out. He hit me first, then he threw me out. Just because of you. Oh, well, I didn't intend for that to happen, Baby-san. Oh, he'll call me back. He always does. Then he buy me presents. Then I have to tell him everything that happened. You're not the first, you know? Oh, I'm surprised to hear that. You're sure of yourself, aren't you? He hurt me. Look what he did. Ahh! Does that feel better? Mm-hmm. Much. Did he hurt you anyplace else? Mm. All over. Good morning, Baby-san. Good morning. Mmm, what's that? Ah, fresh coffee. What are you doing up so early? Something happen? I'll be leaving in a few minutes, driving into town. Oh, yeah? What's your hurry? Oh, I see. He's forgiven you already, has he? Well, it's back to the same old routine, huh? Oriental doll for sale. I've no choice. After all, he's Kumada. What he wants, he gets. Why don't you just walk away? You don't seem to understand. You just don't walk away from Kumada. Forget about Kumada, or you will end up dead, like your friend, Connie. [Woman] Telephone for you, sir. It's a Mr. Bolt. All right, put him through. I was beginning to hope you were dead, old boy. Going away, where? All right, I'll look into it. Where are you now? Very well then, where will you be? Of course, I know the place. It's a bit public though, isn't it? [Receiver Clicks, Dial Tone] Hello? Hello, are you there? No, you are not there. [Engine Rumbling, People Chattering] The police are looking for you everywhere with a number of embarrassing questions, and here you sit, right out in plain view. Obviously that's the best place to hide. Tell me about Kumada's operation. It's taken us years to put it all together. It's a two-way operation. Drugs. Literally tons of it. Someone supplies Kumada, and he supplies them. Like strategic chemicals. Unreported purchases made through phony U.S. businesses, financed with the kind of money you were carrying. Those tankers out there with that nitro-- Nitrous oxide. Rocket fuel. That's it. The whole island is one large series... of storage tanks for liquid rocket fuel... with extremely tight security. How many men you got inside there? Two, and they're first rate. Why? Well, look like there gonna be three. You might just end up getting yourself killed. Look, friend... They killed Sam. They wiped out my friend, Connie. I've been knifed, acupunctured and shot at. So what's so new about me getting myself killed? And I've had just about enough of this Kumada. Now if you wanna sit here on your fat ass, that's all right. But not me. I'm gonna destroy that bastard. [Bolt] He owes me something, and I'm gonna collect it. First off, some early fireworks in honor of the newyear on that island of his. A fter that, it's him and me, man to man. [Bolt] Didyou get everything I asked for? [Man] Yes, boss. [Dog Panting] [Barking] [Barking Continues] This'll just put him to sleep for a while. - [Tranquilizer Gun Fired] - [Whimpering] [Tranquilizer Gun Fired] [Man On Walkie-Talkie Speaking Chinese] It's his walkie-talkie. [Man On Walkie-Talkie Continues] [Speaking Chinese] [Alarm Blaring] [Sirens Wailing] ♪♪ [Whistling] Happy New Year, Kumada! All right, thanks a lot, boys. I'll take it from here. It's about time I paid a call on my friend Kumada. [Yelling In Chinese] [Motor Starting] [Speaking Chinese] [Yelling In Chinese] [Slams Receiver] Bolt? Yes, Bolt. And they let him get away. [Truck Rumbling] [Soldier] Hello? Hello, the house. Jenkins here with group four. We're at the waterfall, starting our patrol now. You tell Mr. Kumada that if that blighter Bolt... is anywhere in this end of the estate, he hasn't a chance to make it to the wall. Out. Oh, no, man. It's been a long night. [Grunting] [Groaning] [Kumada] Very sporting, Mr. Bolt. You have given me a New Year's celebration I will long remember. And it is questionable now, which of us is in debt to the other. But I think it is I, and I intend to be paid. - Ay! - [Gunfire] That wasn't necessary. I had him. [Speaking Chinese] I'll take that. Thank you very much. [Shouting In Chinese] Oh, naughty, naughty. You mustn't talk to Mr. Griffiths like that. I can assure you that my mother never did any of those things. At least not that I'm aware of. Your papers, old boy, as promised. Just like that, huh? No luggage, no money? Consider yourself fortunate to be getting off so lightly. Now go and sin no more. Well, at any rate, go. I hope you don't regret it. If we do, we shall conceal it as best we may. Good show. What the devil are you-- How does he manage that? [Woman On P.A. System Announcing Flights] Ah, Mr. Bolt. Well, I'll take it now. Okay. I was in a hurry the other day. Didn't get a chance to pay you. Ah, you're rich. Thank you, thank you. Have a good smoke. Come back soon. At these prices, it'll be my pleasure.
