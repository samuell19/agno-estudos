[bagpipe music playing] -Why have you told everyone that I'm leaving or selling the ranch? -I don't want you wasting your life here in this-- so I won't, Sophie, I won't. -Dad left me the ranch and I'm staying. You know that, Mother. -Let's not now, not today, please. -High heels-- high heeled shoes. I came here with-- with one, only one pair, bridesmaid shoes. The mice made a bed in them first season, first year. 30 years later, I'm still standing here in flat shoes, washing dishes. And every other girl in the country who looks like you can at least expect to come away from university with a man who can buy her a dishwasher. Will you put away your father's damn books? You don't know [inaudible] from [inaudible]. -Mother, please go in and lie down. I can do these dishes myself. This guy is late, and I've got lots of time. -You know perfectly well it's not the dishes. And don't pretend it is. Fine. Your father had dreams, charming in a man. Thank the good Lord for that bit of money my grandfather left me. Ian was a loon to leave you this ranch. And you're a worse loon not to sell it. You can't afford to hire someone to work you don't know. -Well, I can't do it alone, and I am going to do it. So his mother says he's a very good worker, and he knows the farm. -Well, this young buck, Alexander Bresnyachuk, as it so happens, is-- [knocking] -Come in. Hi. -Hi. -I'll just carry on with the dishes. -So I, uh, [clears throat] well, I suppose your mother's told you everything about the job. And now it's not a lot of money, I know. But, um-- didn't we go to high school together? -Yeah. SOPHIE: Well, it's been a long time, I mean, since, what, high school, I guess, huh? -Yeah. SOPHIE: 15 years? About so. -So is your mother moving to Vancouver? -Yeah. She's got a sister there, so she's going to go live with her, and-- -I'm sorry about your dad. -Yeah, thanks. The uh, ranch ends in that valley there, and past that point it's the, uh-- -Burley's. -Burley's land, thank you. -So what'd you do in Toronto? -I was a lounge act. -A what? -I played piano in bars, you know? "Don't Cry For Me, Argentina," "Moon River," like that. -Really? SOPHIE: Yeah, the fences are all in bad shape, but we sold off the cow calf operation when Dad got sick and kind of let them go. -It's good land for cow calf. -Well, horses, I was thinking. So I understand you were away for a while. -Yep. -But you've moved back, I guess. -Yeah. -For good? -Oh, I don't know. Four men in one home's pretty tough. -Try two women. AUCTIONEER: Seven in the ring, boys. Same old, same old. All right. Good. You bet. You bet they're good steers, boys. Eight quarter and a half. Eight quarter. [auctioneering] -Don Herman bought some of your father's breeding stock. Misses, is it? -Miss. RANCHER: Miss. [auctioneering] -You're not interested in anything here. It's pretty basic, but uh, I think you should have a look at Sherlake Cross. It's real good stock. -I don't know. My instinct's still horses. I only want to live and work with things I love. -That's pretty sentimental. Horses aren't very practical. -SOPHIE: You never get used to them, do you? -Beg your pardon. -Sunsets. -Maybe you would if she'd ever repeat one. -So I gather you don't think horses make sense for me. -Oh, they're pricey, Sophie. I mean, you could breed quarter horses, but it'd cost you enough. You got some pain for it in three years. -Three years? Boy have I been thinking day to day. -Why are you staying here anyway? -Because I don't want to spend my life in some smoky bar wearing a sequin top playing "New York, New York" for potential heart attack victims, that's why. [chuckles] Who was it you dated in high school, Alex? Alex? [dog barking] We're at my place. -God, I guess I was sleeping. -I guess. -Did I snore? -Well-- I'm only kidding. You didn't. Do you want a cup of coffee? -No. Thanks. -If you wanted to, you could take the truck from here, get an early start in the morning. -OK. [dog barking] [car starting] -Come here. Come here. Hi, girl. Yes. Yes. Yes, you're a big, stupid girl. Yes, you are. -And now we're willows, weeping willows. Oh, boo-hoo. Waving in the wind. Nothing's giving our bodies. Waving-- -I must say, you ladies make the most graceful forest. [giggling] -And waving. And now we're strong maples. Reach up. Very, very strong, and very, very tall. -So how was the cattle auction? -Lots of cattle. -Lots of Alexander Bresnyachuk? -Oh, I just remembered what I hate about small towns. -They sure love women like you. I went to see a [inaudible], OK? -You want to see one every day? -Ew, a bit transparent. -There are a few things you don't know about Mr. B. -Gossip's so attractive in a man. -Fine, fine, OK, no problem. -I suppose you and, um, uh, Alex have, uh, plans for Saturday night. -No, of course we don't. Great. Pick you up at the usual time? -Ab! -And since you're not interested, I promise not to tell you anything more about Alex-- like why he left. But I'll bet you wish I had. -Lemonade? -Yeah. -Thompson just delivered the irrigation pipes. -Did you check them off against the invoice? -No, but I'm sure they're fine. -Mm-hm. Well, that rig's coming in Saturday, so we should probably hire a couple bay workers through Sunday. -Yeah, OK. Well, what about your brother, Luke? No. -Take your eye off him for a second, he's got his nose in a book. So uh, I guess you'd be going out Saturday? -No. -OK. Good. -United Church Bridge Club give prizes, like the little bars of soap with-- with beads and stuff like that stuck in them with pins. Nice to look at, but you can't dust them. [laughs] Sniff that one. Five diamonds, game. -Well, I'm off. Bye-bye. WOMAN: Where are you going? -Into town, a movie. WOMAN: With Robert? -Why is there only one phone in this house? Robert, hi. Hi. Yeah, I'm glad I caught you. Listen, uh, oh, you won't believe this. Something really stupid's come up, and I can't, um, yeah. I know. Really, I'm really sorry about this, but it-- no, stop. Of course I am. I just-- I forgot I had this prior thing. You know, I can't-- yes, quite frankly, with Alex. Well, sorry. You too. -Oh, Sophie, no. -No what? -Well, I hardly think it's appropriate. -Appropriate? -Well, I don't see what you're going to talk about. He's not educated. Well, I'm only thinking of you. Now you know I don't care, but other people-- I mean, he's-- -Ukrainian. -We're going to a movie, not breeding. -Well, I for one think that Robert is quite the gorgeous thing. -Well, he's free tonight. -Your father-- -No fair. [car honking] WOMAN: He's no manners. -Don't wait up. [door closing] [music playing] SOPHIE: You know, I worked here my last year of high school. God, I thought if I ever saw another grilled cheese-- oh, it's uh, oh-- Walter, hi. -Hey, Soph. Alex. -Walter, you hated it here. -Oh, well, you know, I'm supporting three kids now and big Ruth McIntyre, so's I guess I better like it. -Oh, wow. -Besides I, in part, own the place now. -Do you? -In part. So what can I get you? -Uh-- ALEX: I'll have a burger with gravy on the fries and a milk, please. -You got it. -Oh, you don't sell the rice pudding, do you? -You bet. We sure do. SOPHIE: Great. I'll have that WAITER: Drink? SOPHIE: Pineapple shake. No, I won't. I'll have soda water. WAITER: That's good. -Ooh, look at this. Do you have a quarter? -Yeah. "Brown-Eyed Girl." "He's so. Fine," "You Can't Hurry Love." Oh, oh-- do you remember this? [music playing] -This is-- um-- -No. -No, after you. -Well, you know Robert Marcovich at the high school? -I know you're seeing him, yeah. SOPHIE: Well-- -Jerk date. -Well, then it's some kind of guy competition thing, because-- -No. Sophie, um, there's something I've been thinking about, something I want to talk to you about. -Hm? -You know I want a place, right? I want a ranch, and uh-- SOPHIE: Great, thanks. --[clears throat] Well, anyway, I uh, I think you got what it takes for ranching. I really do. I guess I didn't for a while there, though. -Really? Thank you. -So what it means is that we both got something that the other one wants now. So you think I'm, uh, what? -You mean what do I think of you? -OK. -I think you have just about the nicest forearms I've ever seen. [chuckles] -Well, I'm not sure quite what you mean. -You want to stay on your father's place, right? -Mm-hm. -Well, I want to stay on your father's place, too. -I'm sorry, you've lost me completely. Can we just go back a bit? -I'm proposing that we get married. No, I'm serious. You know, we could have a long engagement till you could, uh-- till you could see that-- -See what? -That we could do it, that we can make it work. See, I think I'd make a good husband. And I'm pretty sure you'd make a good wife. This would be business. [car starting] Did I insult you? -Look, can't we just sleep together like reasonable adults? -Sophie, I'm 29, OK? You're even older a little, right? Like a year. I mean, you must want to have kids. Well, I do too. I want to have kids and a wife. SOPHIE: Put an ad in the paper. -But this is done. -Believe me, I know. -I mean, it's how it happened for my mother. -I know, Alex. I've traveled. I've been to India. I've seen the results of a lot of arranged marriages. -And they didn't work out? -No, actually, a lot of them were fine, but-- -Look, I know I could do something with that place of yours. -Why don't you just buy it then? -Because every rancher should have a wife. -But should ever wife have a rancher? -OK. All right, you're just-- you're too smart for me, I guess. -I'm sorry. I just don't know how to take this seriously. -Think about it some more. -No. Alex, no. [cars honking] [piano playing] -And running, and running, and stop. What do you see? Why, it's a beautiful flower. And you pick it and smell. Wonderful. Now use your scarves, and lightly, lightly on your toes. But where is our prince? Where could he be? Wasn't he here just moments ago? Our hearts are so big and so full. And we are swoon and fall. [bell ringing] Very nice, ladies. You may go. That's all for today, Soph. -OK, we'll see you Wednesday. -Bit of a traffic jam in town the other night? -This is not making you more attractive to me. -Look, Sophie, great women simply do not walk into this town. You're looking at a man in pain here-- dumped, rejected. For what? Some bo-hunk. Sorry. Anyway, I gather things didn't work out too well the other night. I hope. I hope. No melancholy baby for me? Guess not. It's not that he's a creep. I mean, I'm a creep myself sometimes. -Oh, say it isn't true. -As long as you know what these Ukrainian guys are after, with the exception of myself, of course. -Meaning what? He's after my ranch, but you, you're just after my body, right? ALEX: You been thinking about it? SOPHIE: Alex, I don't know you. ALEX: First thing after I left, I worked in Le Duke. Then I got to thinking, what-- what the hell are you doing? You know, you're 22. You-- so I finished school. I went back for three months. -Finished in three months? -Yeah. Well, all the other kids were 15, and my knees didn't hardly fit under the desk. So I wasn't going to hang around. And then I went north and worked the rigs. It's a miserable occupation. When the booze and the fighting kind of emptied me out, I hitched home. -It's really not sex, is it? -Sophie, all I'm saying is I think us marrying is your best shot at a working ranch. That's straight goods. -So you're looking at me and you're thinking cattle. That's terrific. All right, Alex, how about we simply court in a traditional time-honored fashion, OK? We have a quick bout of nude wrestling followed by confessions of doubt leading to mutual rejection, and then if by some miracle it is true love, we cry, we say we're sorry, and we wrestle some more. I'm not marrying a man I don't know, Alex. Coming, Alex? Listen, Alex, If we have sex, it won't make me not nice. -Hey, one thing that I think, that I feel, there's probably a whole lot of that tough city girl crap you'd do well to dump. [piano playing] [crying] -That song-- I'm sorry. -No. No. It's just that I've never barbecued before. He had always-- your father cooked the meat. [crying] -It's OK. -I don't even like barbecued food. It's all burnt and dirty. When I get to Vancouver, I'm going to date. [chuckles] I'm serious. Don't laugh. -OK, that's fine. -Tell me about a party you've been to, how ritzy, sophisticated, all those gorgeous university men. Was there a special one? [inaudible] letters that first year. -A bit nervous I like Alex, are you, Mother? -Just don't forget your dream. -Whose dream? -Oh. Look what you made me do. Burnt the burgers. -Listen, I'll tell you, I finally figured out who those university men wanted to date, versions of themselves with long hair and tits. -Oh, Sophie. [laughing] -You-- just tell me that you're going to sell this place and have yourself a life. Oh, no. -Ooh. [chuckles] -Are you OK? -Yeah. [sighs] You win. -Beg your pardon. -OK. All right. -Um, what do you mean? -I mean, OK. -You're saying yes? OK, well, that's, uh-- [sniffs] that's great. Uh, listen, we're gonna have to-- gonna have to call Thompson's in the morning about-- about this motor. -OK, good. -OK, good. -I'm going to wake up Mom. -OK. VERA: I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. No! -Mother. -She's artistic. She's educated. What do you have to say about Mr. Beethoven or Mr. Mozart? Sophie, you've never been a fool. Don't tell me now that you're getting married just on the basis of-- of what? Sex, I suppose. -No, it isn't sex, believe me. -My parents-- -Your parents are Ukrainian. -Whoa, Mother. -Stop that. I don't believe what I'm hearing. And if your father were here-- -You know he wanted me to stay. -Your father did not give you this ranch just so that you could give it away. -I'm not. We can make it work. Between us, this is a business. It's a partnership. You understand that. -Understand? Understand? Why should I understand, Mr. Bresnyachuk? What is there to understand? You should have been married a long time ago, and you know that I sure enough understand that. -What is that supposed to mean? I wasn't going to say it. I wasn't going to-- I was not. -Alex? -She's talking about Bennie. -You tell my daughter the truth. -He's my son. -With whom, Alex? -Annie Malone. -I knew Annie. -That's why I left. -I see. You got her pregnant and you left. Is that it? So where's your son now? -He's in, uh, Marcovich's class. -Why didn't you just tell me? Why didn't you just tell me the truth? I wouldn't have-- [sighs] Fine, I'm so tired. Alex, tomorrow, this little arrangement between us has not happened, all right? You work here. I pay you, and that's it. Good night. Go. -Sophie, you just-- -Don't. It's not sexual. I knew the first moment he said it. If I wanted to keep the ranch, I needed his help. And I find-- VERA: You could be a concert pianist and travel the world. -No, I can't. Mother, I don't have it. Whatever it takes, it's not there. And I am not here because I think that I failed. I am here because this is where I want to be. And this little incident isn't going to force me away. I'm not going to make that mistake. -I can finish up the season. -What? -I decided I'd better go. -Yeah, fine. -Listen, Sophie, I shouldn't have-- -Look if you think it's a threat, it's no threat, OK? Just so you know. -No, I wasn't thinking that. I just thought that, uh-- [car honking] -I'm going to lunch. I'll be back by 3:00. [music playing] ANNOUNCER: Thank you, rodeo fans. And now here's a young man making his first appearance in a long, long time, Mr. Alex Bresnyachuk. [horn] [cheering] ANNOUNCER: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. He turned in a time of 4.94. We'll move on down now to the arena. -Hey, Sophie, listen, you want to take it easy. He's gonna be pretty feisty if hasn't been rode. -Ridden. And I've not been neglecting my horse, thank you. I'm OK. Ma? Ma? -No, no. Now listen, doctor-- you know Dr. Morrison? He's right here. Says you just have a mild concussion. But you're to stay put. -Did you get my horse? VERA: Alex got the horse. -Did he get the horse? VERA: Yeah, the horse is fine. OK, now you just rest. -Just give me-- VERA: Yeah, we'll look after him. [music playing] -Annie? -Yeah? -Hi. I'm Sophie Ware. Mind if I sit down? -Take the load off. Did you say you were drinking, Sophie Ware? Fizz, swing, something with peach schnapps in it? -Nothing, thanks. -Who are you? -We went to high school together, uh, Livingston. Do you remember? Actually, I was a couple grades ahead of you, so-- but you know Robert Marcovich, right? He's the school principal. Yeah, he said I could find you here, and I just would like to have a talk with you, if that's OK. -I'm going to the can. Rob attacked me in here, broke the mirror, went after me with these shards, fingers all bloody. I decked him. Got some jackass beating up on you? -Fell off my horse. ANNIE: Better than saying you walked into a cupboard. Well, what? -Well, it's rather complicated. I'm involved with someone you used to date-- Alexander Bresnyachuk. -Alex never beat up on a woman in his life. -What? No. No, I really, I-- I really did fall off my horse. -Here, hold this. I'm gonna do what I came here for. I can still hear you. -Um, well, I just found out. He just told me about you. ANNIE: What about me? -About Bennie. ANNIE: Yeah, there's a Bennie. -Well, I thought we could straighten things out. You know, I just want to do the right thing. ANNIE: Yeah, well, you and Alex, too, eh? Sends me these checks, $20, $80, $130. Keep it. I still got three. -He's back, you know. He's here now. -I got a man, honey. What? You writing a book? -I remember you, Miss Sucky Piano at school. -Can I buy you another beer? ANNIE: Sure. Never refuse a beer. [music playing] -You're telling me you're too good for him? -I just hate to think that he walked out on you, you know, like it was your problem. WOMAN: Get me a drink will you? -I booted him out. [train bells ringing] There he is, nice, big, popular white kid, and an Indian girl up and gets herself pregnant and ruins his life. Think I wanted that hanging over my head, in this town? Screw that. I raised that kid alone. It was fine, just fine. -Really? -Not easy, fine. ALEX: Hi. -So how you doing, Sasha? -Fine, Annie. -So I heard you got married. -He's away a lot, long haul driver. -So how's Bennie? -Good. Why don't you just talk to him? He's funny. -So I guess he doesn't like me too much. -Why? Because you left him alone with me? That's kind of insulting. Trish. TRISH: Yeah? -Sasha's buying. We'll start with three double whiskeys. [laughs] -Why didn't you just tell me? -Ow. It wasn't my story you wanted to hear. It was hers. -So now I suppose it's my turn. -For what? -Well, I have a ranch. And I thought I might marry myself a ranch hand just so I didn't have to pay him. Just a business deal-- you think you're interested? -Yeah. Come on. VERA: Well, all I know is that she's promised me she'd sell. And this is the last I've heard from Herman. I caught him forking out the sign, just plucking it right out. Can you imagine? You assume quite a lot, young man, you really do. -I'm sorry. I guess I thought you'd talk. -Mother, I've changed my mind. -No you haven't. No, no. Well, I guess we could just leave it there as a joke for Eleanor. -Eleanor? You're kidding. -Oh, did I forget to tell you, she called. Yeah, she called, and I invited her here next weekend for a few days. That girl will lighten the mood around here a wee bit. -And Eleanor just happens to be a real estate agent, am I right? -Kissing outside the bar on Main Street. You're a disgrace. -[speaking ukranian] -First time I've gotten this far at meeting the parents. -They were real happy when I called. They think I'm marrying you for your money. -You are. -You'll like my mother. -Not your father? -She walks to me, all blonde, red dress. I am [inaudible]. She is traitor. And uh, she comes to me and she says, Rudolph, kiss me. Well, I didn't know mama then, Sophie. But our bloody men, [inaudible], I kiss her. -Then he shoots her. [laughing] -Oh, Papa. He makes it up. You turn yourself into a joke. MAMA BRESNYACHUK: Alex. -No, it's all right, Mama. It's OK. I-- I forgive them. But you made a sour note, Sasha. And it's all for you. So we talk marriage. To Rudy, the oldest, I have to leave all land, yeah? Sasha, money. And the Luke, nothing. [laughing] Nothing. -Negotiations later, Papa. Is it OK, Sophia? -Oh, yes, of course. -Your father, Sophia, is a wonderful man. Not everybody says it. He comes here from city, Mr. Green Acres. -(SINGING) You are my wife, goodbyes. -What do you say, Sophia, that Alexander Bresnyachuk is a good looking boy, yeah? But your papa would look at him and say, that one is a good worker. -Yes, like buying a horse. -Yeah, good, very good. Your mama is-- -I think we should be leaving. -OK. -Walk with me. Sasha. -Because he has a grandson he does not know, it's so hard for Papa to forgive him. I thank God for you, Sophia. -She's a modern girl, Papa. She won't. -No negotiation, no. She's strong, you see. She's smart. It must be done. -Well, it won't be done. -Her mama, you tell her to come. It's for her mama to decide. -No, Papa, I won't. -Don't be ashamed of us, Sasha. Never be ashamed of your family. It's me? Me? I embarrass? This one at least you marry first. ALEX: He's been in this country 40 years. How the hell does he hold onto the accent? -What? Alex, we're engaged. Do you fine me attractive? -I've never even dated a girl with a diploma. [laughing] -Oh, Alex. Are you sure you wouldn't like a little coffee, tea, or-- -No. Thank you. Good night. [honking] -Eleanor. [screaming] -Oh, stop. God. Where is he? Where is he? -Oh no. What did she tell you? -Oh, you're getting married. You're not getting married. You're getting married. -Oh, Mother, such wonderful things. -Oh, god. -Eleanor. -[grunts] How is he? Wait a second. Really shoulders? -Yes, yes. -Ooh. Tall? -Oh, stop. -Oh, god. I'm dying. I'm dying. I'm dying. I'm dying. Where is he? Where is he? What? Are you hiding him? -No. -Come on, Soph. Tell me, where is he, Sophie? -He's, um-- -What? -Why don't we go for a little walk first? -Wait, wait-- -We could-- -You want-- you want me to go for a walk in my full priced suede mod [inaudible] pumps? What, are you crazy? We'll take my car. -OK. No, wait, wait. Let's-- let's take my truck. -What? Truck? What, are you crazy? Oh. [chuckling] So you own this too? -Well, it's here. -Oh. Well, what do you say we condo-ize? No, no, no, really. It's clear potential. I mean, there's more than enough room here for an in-ground pool. Oh my. Now doesn't that just break your heart? -Yeah, it's beautiful. -Beautiful. Kind of makes you think of the old girl stuck in this shack, waiting for her man to come home. She's lighting her little lamp, nobody to talk to but entirely unfashionable rats. -No rats in Alberta? -Oh, no. Any man that sticks a woman out here is definitely a rat. [laughing] -You look fabulous. -Eh, it's a makeover. Cost a small fortune. -How's Arnold? Well, let's just say that there's, without question, rats in Ontario. [laughs] So listen, this fiance-- -Mm-hm. -I do hope he's worth the easy $300k plus you could get for this place. Oh, I'm sorry. All right, so tell me about him then. -Well, he's not impossibly rich or intellectually intimidating. -What am I hearing? -I think you're hearing me mimic you. He's straight forward, clear-headed, and I can be myself with him. -Ah. So is it, uh, L-O-V-E? -No, it's business. -Soph. SOPHIE: You know, Eleanor, listen, I've been here a while, and I can't do the shtick thing anymore, you know, and I don't even want to. -Wait, so you think this guy's going to think that I'm totally superficial? -Yeah, he is. [laughing] Listen, I know how seductive that whole urban cynical thing is, but I got to tell you, you know, I-- I watch him ride his horse or play with the dog, and he is so under the surface. -All right, all right, I promise that I will be on my best behavior. All right? So then, what, his disposable income is under, what, 40? So-- wait. VERA: I've seen it happen before. The eldest inherits land, and the younger boys marry generations of plain girls, with handsome husbands who are never at home. ELEANOR: She's not playing, Vera. VERA: That makes it worse. That boy just wants property. -What are you thinking? -I was just waiting for my dad to come out of the barn for lunch-- make him a toast and meatloaf sandwich, maybe. He never once admitted he was dying. ALEX: To you or to himself? -You know how I knew? Last month I was getting ready to go back to Toronto and I was packing and running around, and he asked me to come in, sit down, and read his will to him. Him sitting right there, and I read, "To my beautiful, smart daughter, Sophie, I leave this." Oh, he could look right into you. But he wouldn't let me cry. -Oops. [chuckles] Hi, Soph. Eleanor Cruise. How very nice to meet you, Alex. -Hello, Eleanor. So you're on holiday? -Oh, I am. Uh, and it is such a beautiful spot, except for the extreme lack of shopping. [laughing] -No, there's not much of that. Ah. Sister of mercy, you are an incredibly good looking man. Listen, if its that easy, I think I'm going to buy a farm and get one too. -Try some of this. Did you tell her? -Vera, no-- -Uh, Ellie thinks that, you know, with the way that, uh, city people are buying up country properties and with the proximity of Calgary-- well, it's not too late. -[sighs] Oh, hey, Soph, face it. I mean, you won't last two years here. I know you. Oh, I'm-- oh yeah, I mean, he's gorgeous, sure. But-- -I don't believe it. Wait, no, Soph, come on. Just hear me out, all right? -I have to get to the school. -He's not worth it. [shouting] -What happened? -Grape vine has it he up and hit Greg Burley in the fist with his nose. Go clean yourself up, and I'll give you a ride home. -Put a cold washcloth against it, Ben. You like him, don't you? -I'm not sure it's safe to. Yes, I do. He's different. He's a philosopher. He's very good at math, believe it or not. And I teach math, so there you go. Come on, you guys, break it up. -I can give him a ride home, Robert. So I hear you're pretty good at math. -Hate it. -What do you like, baseball? You know, I have this ranch out on the old number two, passed the bridge. I'm always looking for some good part time help. -You a social worker or what? -No, I'm not. Why? -You sound like one. -How so? -You're full of suck, suck, suck, sucky. Suck, suck, suck, sucky. I know who you are, right? With who. People know, so don't social work me. -I just think your father would really like to talk to you, Bennie, and I know you'd like to talk to him. Where'd you get this suck act? Don't tell me what I think. Because what I think is that he looks like an asshole. -Well, he isn't. BENNIE: He's done nothing from here once, just hiked up my mom's skirts. It's got nothing to do with me-- nothing, not a thing. WOMAN: [non-english speech] -Um, Annie. ANNIE: Sophie. -Hi. ANNIE: Hi. Bennie had a little mishap at school, and-- -It's OK, Ma. She's no social worker. She's a friend. -That's the nicest thing I've heard all day. -Third season we were here, put the bales in damp. Sun got hot, pressure built up, the whole place blew, like the crack of thunder. There we were, back in debt. Tea? -Yeah, thanks. -Why do men almost pretend not to be vain? Telling me your papa wants to negotiate with me, Alex. Brilliant girl, my daughter, and with money. Go anywhere, do anything-- anything. She's already had a taste of that anything. Sophie has performed solo on stage at the Ontario Place. She'll leave here, end up with you holding a wrench and her chances. -But didn't her father-- -Don't you dare mention her father. I'll negotiate. You tell your papa I'm prepared, and I know exactly what to protect and how. -I'll let them know. -You don't talk of sense and business. I watched you moving your spell. A woman who loves a man who doesn't love her is a fool. A fool's ugly. Now bring the thermos back to the house when you're finished. -He won't confront things. He won't fight with me. When did he leave you? -I don't remember. Yeah, I do. Want a cheese slice? That's what there is. -Sure. -He left town three days before the birth. Mama Bresnyachuk came to the hospital to tell me. brought me pierogies. But I figured, he'll be back, check it out, make sure he's got all his fingers and toes, his son. I didn't care if he was in town, I just wasn't marrying him. Should have known better, though. When that boy is gone, he's gone. 12 years and only checks. First I thought it was his weird papa sending them to me. He sure is one beautiful man, though. -Between you and me, makes the backs of my knees sweat. [chuckles] --[clears throat] So Vera tells me she thinks you two haven't been sleeping together. [laughs] Is that true? It's kind of like the blond holding out for the mink. Do you love her? Look, I sort of know psychology. My friends call me the lay shrink. But this is a new one on me. I mean, you could have just about any woman you want, right? Look at me. You hurt her, and I'll come back here with a rusty spoon and have your balls. That girl saved my life. I love her. She's the only real person I've ever met. Well, I know you heard me. -Come on. -Eleanor, you did your best. -We'll see you, Vera. -Drive carefully. -I'll miss you, Soph. -Yeah, well-- -Soph, I'll miss you. SOPHIE: Eleanor left early. You know, as bad as she must have seemed-- ALEX: No, I liked her. SOPHIE: What? Really? ALEX: Yeah. She's loyal. She's tough. SOPHIE: So tell me what goes on at these negotiations exactly. ALEX: Well, Papa will try to-- it's so both parties can marry as equals, but it can get kind of hairy. I don't know about your mother. SOPHIE: Oh, hey, don't. Secretly, she's thrilled. I mean, picture it. A few vodka toasts, hugs, weeping, an all-out frenzy of competitive gift giving. -Sophie, you know, it isn't-- -Oh, don't. Don't worry, I'll behave. I can't believe we're doing this. VERA: Well, the Scotts are no fools either. -Either? -I've always quite liked his mother. -Welcome. -Mr. Bresnyachuk. -Welcome to Bresnyachuk farm. VERA: It's lovely. Of all the ways the wind doth blow, I early love the West. Do you like poetry, Mr. Bresnyachuk? -[sighs] From that fence to that tree, it's always mine VERA: Fine piece of property. Oh, it's beautiful, yes. Some of machinery goes with Alex. That he earned over several years hard at work. -I certainly hope you've got a better tractor than ours that he can take. -Um, no. No, no, tractor is promised to my brother, Alexei. -Oh. I'm sure we can figure something out. I'm ready. MAMA BRESNYACHUK: Mrs. Ware will have some more sherry. -Oh, only a very little. Thank you. -Sasha is an electrical mechanic, also plumber, furnace man, refrigerator fixer, and mud man. -Oh, mud man. Oh, I don't believe-- -Mud man is not correct? On oil rig. Oh, very, very smart-- grade 12. -Certainly a good farmer, which he must have learned from you, Mr. Bresnyachuk. Done an excellent job for us. -Sasha will be good father, too. Is loving children. -And of course, our Sophie was an only child. -Which I think they probably already know. -Is lovely girl. -Sophie, maybe you would like to take a walk, you and Alex. -Uh, yes, yes. Uh, Sasha and Sophie, walk. -I'm not moving an inch. PAPA BRESNYACHUK: So that settlement, it's very easy, split 50/50. -50/50 is too much. -Oh, naturally. The question of control, yeah. -Well, we can't dissolve the trust fund, for one thing, because I have to live on the proceeds until I pass away. So that leaves, essentially, the value of the land itself, and the profits from the harvest, if there are any, and the money that we've already banked from the sale of the reading stock this spring. -[groans] [speaking ukrainian] -[speaking ukrainian] -It's none of our business, Papa. -Trust fund-- how much? -Well, that is money from my side of the family with which I have kept our ranch afloat, and from which I currently derive my income, and that money will pass to Sophie and remain solely under her name in perpetuity. So there's no point in disclosing. Now I do have a suggestion. -[speaking ukrainian] -[speaking ukrainian] -I was going to suggest that we fix a flat sum on Alexander out of Sophie's share of the harvest. That way he can get started properly. -Good. So now it is question of land. -No, no land. -Oh, yes, land. -No, no, no, no, no. That's not good offer. -Alex? -Only with a full section I will agree. My boy won't marry without enough of land. -Well, [chuckles] I guess the wedding's off. Thank you, folks. You've worked wonders. -Sophia. -Papa, it's fine. Enough, all right? -Just a trick. -Sorry, no sale. I don't like the deal. How can you just stand there? You know, I suppose I thought that that was going to be about how much I was worth. Like a charming old world harem concept. And you know, I'd even thought, oh, kind of funny. But we were buying you there. My poor widowed mother and I were trading land for a good worker. Well, I draw the line at buying myself a husband, thank you. Double standard, you say, damn straight. And also, quite frankly, do you realize you got marked down? I'm going to bed. [door closing] -Good night, Alexander. [water pouring] -You have no idea what I feel. SOPHIE: Come here. Come here. Come here. [dog barking] [music playing] MAN: [inaudible] away from that crap. Nope. You're stuck loading [inaudible]. You're a businessman with business. [inaudible] You sure ain't the type to love a lady stupid. -Well, there's a limit to what I can fight. -Oh, sure. Both of us knows, if you did love the lady, nothing is [inaudible]. Nope. You'd hike, lickety split, back, maybe with a gift, maybe. You say she likes horse? BENNIE: Yep! -Hi. Is, uh, Sophie here? -They're gone. They went swimming. -Oh. -What? -Can I come in? -No. -You want to punch me, or what? -Don't flatter yourself. I already saw the movie-- punching, and we're supposed to cry and hug and that crap. Why should I go through with it? Ain't my problem, as I see it. I mean, uh, what would I get out of it? -Nothing, I guess-- except this horse. -You serious? -Yeah. -Gift's a good idea. You want a beer? -You gonna have one? -Hell, I'm only 13. I'll take the horse. -Yeah, that's not bad. You want to drop this one a little bit. Give her a little more head. That's it. -That's-- -Keep bending your left. That's fine. Hold up here, so it's loose, all right? -Yeah, but it's twisted. Should I turn it? -Uh-huh, it's OK. Then you just-- you hold the slack up and you ride. And you don't hold on to the horse. -Can you, like, wrap it around? -No, don't wrap it. OK? Now you're trying to feel it mostly in your legs. Can you feel her underneath you down there? -Yeah, you can feel her moving, yeah? -Yeah. -That's cool. I mean, this is great. Any time you feel guilty about anything, you can buy me stuff. -[chuckles] All right. -OK, you're on. -Want to cantor? -Yeah, let's try. -[clicks] Come on. -Ever had sushi? -Yeah. -What is it? -It's raw fish. -[chuckles] Saves some time. -He's taking off, Annie. -I'd introduce you to my brother-in-law. Can't see you with a guy with loose dentures. Sorry, Soph. Sophie. Who's that, Bennie? -He gave him to me. -Hi, Annie. -Figure out how much the feed is and add it to your next check, big shot. -Hi. -Hi. -I got that horse for you as an engagement present. I gave her away. Hey, Soph. -Mm-hm. -What do we do on our wedding night with our folks at home? -[laughs] Oh, thank you. -For what? -You just thought about me without thinking cattle. -We always fight, Sasha. Now never again. Today I-- I have no words for what-- -Pop, you don't have to apologize. -Apologize? I am no apologize. Apology is weak and sorry is weak. And I am not sorry. I say what I mean. How about farming. Maybe we'll just talk about farming after the wedding. -Just farming? -Hm. OK. You need new tractor. [knocking] -Ma? It's for you. -It's your wedding. -Well, it's just a little something. It's-- -Oh. Oh, um, [inaudible] drive me to the station in the morning. -Oh, good. -I think she's going to sing at the wedding. -Oh, no. -High heels? High heeled shoes. Oh. And plum, to match my hat! -Yes. [laughs] -Oh. [crying] I only hope that you and Alex have as much fun in this room as your father and I did. -Look at that. Do you see that leg? Why are they going tractor, Papa? They can use the car. What's the matter with the car, Papa? WOMAN: Bye! [engine turning over] [laughing] -Oh, you're kidding. -Well, not much we can do. -So what are we going to do? -Oh, I've got a couple ideas up my sleeve. -Well, there's got to be a first time for everything. [laughs] Oh, checking me into the no tell motel? ALEX: Nope. SOPHIE: Oh, you dirty, dirty dog. You planned this. -You city girls don't miss much, do you? [cheers] [music playing]
