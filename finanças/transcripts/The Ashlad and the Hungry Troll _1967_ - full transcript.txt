The story of Ashlad and the Hungry Troll ...in the courtyard were running. One hen took flight, in the garden it went. Paul could sense that the hen felt the danger. It must be the fox. Cluck-cluck the hens cried together. Cluck-cluck the hens cried together. Paul was nervous. "I do not dare to go home to my mom". Well, if it isn't Mr. Asbjørnsen! This way, Asbjørnsen! Come here and join us! Drink and be merry! Healthier to be legless, than to be keg-less! It's healthier that I sit over there. Well, if you don't want to, I shan't force you. I can drink it all myself. Hey, there, Tallow-Peter! Fancy a drink? Leave the candle alone! Costs a farthing. Here's the money for the candle. If you can eat that, Tallow-Peter, you'll be ok for a drink. - But it's almost brand new. - Leave the poor man alone. Fill it up! Yes, go on. No, no, eat up. I think you've earned your drink, Tallow-Peter. I'm like the boy who had an eating contest with a troll. Quiet! Tallow-Peter will tell a story. To you lot? I'd sooner pay poker with the grim reaper than tell you a story! Drunken swine! You peasants! - You'll do it for another dram, then? - It'd better be a double. Yes! A double for Tallow-Peter! Just to the rim. Just to the rim, that's the way. Hey, what about the boy who had an eating contest with the troll? Here's the story. Once upon a time there was a farmer who had three sons. The man was very poor. Old and frail, he was. - And his sons were too lazy. - I have two sons. Same old story. Now, belonging to the farm, was a large, lush forest. In which the father wanted his sons to do some logging, - - so that they could pay off some debts. After a short while, he finally talked them into doing it, - - and the eldest son was sent off into the forest first. He had gone deep into the forest, - and started chopping at a huge fir tree, Suddenly before him stood a great, big troll. "If you chop down trees in my forest, I will kill you!" said the troll. The first son ran home, where the old man called him a coward. The trolls had never frightened him, when he was young, said he. The next day the second son went off, but the same thing happened to him. He took to his heels, just like his brother, - - as he saw the troll. The old man was furious. Can you imagine that? Two grown up sons, and they flee like chicken at the mere sound of a troll. I was never frightened of trolls when I was young. I'd like to go and chop some trees. Are you going logging? You just poke about the ashes all day. You'll do fine. Never mind that you've barely been outside the front door. I'll try my luck. Perhaps you'll give me some food for the long walk, mother? Oh, my poor baby. I haven't got much. A fresh piece of cheese I can muster. There'll be plenty of logging in the forest today. You'll be home with mommy before you can say "chicken". Best of luck, and give my regards to the troll. I think... I think I smell man's blood again. Are you here already? Better an anticipator, than a sprinter later. I'd better break out this cheese. Is he here already? Oh yes, I can smell him. But where has he gone to? I'm getting old, and my eyesight's not what it used to be. - Here I am. - Ouch! There you are. Hello! - I see you're chopping down my trees. - It's my father's forest, so why not? Oh, really? Is it now? Your father's forest? The forest is mine see. And if you are going to chop down any of my forest, I will have to kill you! You watch it, or maybe I'll get you! I have never heard of such a thing. Look, I told you to stop it, you upstart, or else... You stop it or I'll squeeze you, like I am squeezing water from this stone. Oh, no! Have mercy! Spare me, please. I'll even help you cut down the trees, if you like. That's better. But I'm extremely hungry. I think I'll eat first. Oh yes, now that you mention it, I'm hungry as well. You can come home with me. My house is very much nearer than yours. Alright. You can sit in my back pocket, for the ride, and we'll soon be there. Could you go and fetch more water for the porridge? The buckets are over there in the corner. No sense in taking those little things. I'll go and fetch the whole well. Oh, no. Dear me. I cannot lose my well. Please, if you'll just take a seat. The porridge is quite fine as it is. Yes, the porridge smells good, and I'm really hungry. What would you say to an eating contest? Yes, an eating contest. A tiny thing like him? How can I lose? Yes, I am in for an eating contest. So I win then. You can't stand any more, can you? Of course I can, wait a moment. That's it. I just had to relieve my stomach, you see. Oh, that's much better. And we're off again. Oh no, I don't think I can eat another thing. Giving up? I'm even not half finished. Do what I did. Cut a hole in your stomach, then you can eat as much as you like. Oh, my dear. But, isn't it terribly painful? Oh no, not really. Is it true what you say? Doesn't it hurt? Far from it. You can trust me on that. And I can eat as much as I want to? Until sunrise, if you like. I suppose I could give it a try... So the troll did as Ashlad said. And that was probably the end of him. The boy took all the troll's gold and silver, and brought it home. With that, his father had no trouble in paying off all his debts. And that goes for me as well. Give me another drop, will you? Yes! A dram for the storyteller! What a great story, Tallow-Peter.
