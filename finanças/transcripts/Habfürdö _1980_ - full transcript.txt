In a downtown textile shop window, Crouching there in the window on the Grand Boulevard, with pins stuck in his ass. - Heehee! It's good, huh? Tell me honestly... what does my ass have to do with all this? Huh? Aunt Manci's joke stabbed my very heart. Or rather, my ass. Anyway, it was a lie. It was pincushion in my pocket.

Yes, it's over, for sure. Thanks for the congratulations. Thank god, it's over. It's so distant... my wedding! You sure you don't want to tell her yourself? Who? Me? What for? So finally, I'm here. Klari, I have something unpleasant to tell you. Don't be angry! Wait a sec! You seduced my groom, haven't you? I didn't seduce your groom! It's a misunderstanding! Haha! Not you, I was talking to Zsuzsa! Imagine, we've been engaged for a year and a half! Annie, I suggest you get a husband. At least once in your life. It's a hell of a lot of fun! I have unpleasant news for you. I'm busy. Talking with somebody else. The number you have dialed is wrong. Hang up and try again, sweetie. I know the whole story by heart. Oh, yeah. It's about work. Another workplace incident. Even on my wedding day, ooo, So on my wedding day, too! Oh yea, it's so rude of me, Oh, lord knows it, I deserve it. I deserve it, for getting married to a man. Ooo, what an unforgivable sin! Oh, of course, I'm sure I know. Our favorite head nurse got it in her head, in her head. That she'll be the one who can break up my private life. Oh, yea, the files again, It's always some missing files. No pardons for that! Oh yeah, I understand her. Since she can't understand herself. She's got nobody. Nobody to boss around. So she tells you: Call up that Klari! Why is she so happy? What is there to smile about? And all those men? Why are they chasing at her skirts? I'll be a pain in her neck as long as she's never been to a discotheque! I deserve it, for Finding a man to marry. Ooo, what an unforgivable sin! She's lying if she says I'm not professional enough. Last week she made a fool of me in front of my parents. So the number you have dialed is wrong! It's my day off, sweetie, so long! - Listen to me, please, Klari! - I'm not angry with you, Annie! You're so nice and proper. You're just a little too servile, An ass-kisser and so obedient. Let the old gals envy my happiness. Just don't believe a word Judy says, or Emily, or Maria. Or go on believing, that everyone is good. Nurse Agi is an immaculate saint. The angel of head nurses. The head nurses, are angels. And those doctors, they're gods. So, listen here. Take a seat. I'm having babies. A happy mommy, a happy daddy. Every 3 years, a new baby. So every 3 years a baby, and every 3 years more Maternity leave! I'll have 5 babies, legally not working for 15 years! Understand? 15 years of freedom! After that, I come back to work with you all. Get the picture? You'll lose touch with the latest advances. Listen, Annie. Take my advice! You and the other girls, too. All you old maids, bursting with envy because you can't Find normal partners! Annika, dear, my message for Zsuzsa, Ethel, Emily and the rest: Get your noses out of my private life, understand? Leave me alone, it's none of your business. And you can all go 'pop'! Watch out for the draft! The dog stole the pheasant! Why did I have to do that! Dear Doctor Lady, what would you say, if a 40 year old shopwindow dresser, with a blown engine and a shabby car, one fine day asked for your hand, would you say 'yes'? Silence means consent. I'm not a doctor lady. I've got a '68 volkswagon, doctor. Why do you keep calling me: Doctor Lady. You have no idea how deep that touches me. Those people would never appreciate my art, Doctor Lady. That's enough about art. Listen, I'm not joking now. Lately, I've been scared of losing myself. I'm doing what others want, not what I want. Oh it's true, why bother them with this? They'll Find out at 5 o'clock. I truly hope it becomes a national scandal. When did you first imagine doing this? How long did you work protecting babies? For 3 years. If it cries, if it whines, if it whimpers... The formula, the medicine, the best of modern advances, The dandling, the rocking, 3 times a day: Breast feeding. If it cries, if it laughs, if it yawns, if the diaper's full. If it cries, if it whines, if it whimpers... Why do you think Klari hates her work, her chosen profession? - Do you smoke, Zsolt? - Oh, thank you very much. Coffee? Silly question. Well, Klari doesn't hate her work, she's just getting even with us old maids that is, her 25-35 year old female colleagues. Natural, no? - What cruel person! - I can understand her. I adore children. How can one not love children? Klari, wants five children. - Hahaha. Just look at me. How could I produce five children? - Why not? I'm done for. I need a nurse. A loving heart. Who can give me artiFicial respiration anytime, and first aid. Try a sanatorium, Zsolt. Haha, or a mortuary! The coldhouse. - Mmm, this mocca is delicious. - But it's only second-rate. That blouse looks nice on you, Annika. That's 3.20 at the GoldBug store, am I right? - No doubt, you're an expert. - Does your work satisfy you? If it satisFied me, I wouldn't want to become a doctor. But I like it. - Circle of friends? - Sorry, no circle of friends. I go by myself to the theatre or cinema. Not to cafes. I feel like it makes me look lonely. I hate when people try to make conversation. Sorry, but I don't believe in lasting relationships. Sorry, but I don't believe in lasting relationships.

Annie, I've gotta go. Zsolt has no idea where I am! I'll get Nandi back somehow. Listen to me! Good thing that Nandi can't hear us. Strictly confidential! I'm going to tell you a secret. Good old Zsolt can't know. Husbands don't need to know everything, right? Bless you. I'll be going soon. I've got 200 people waiting on me. - Forgive me! Oh, forgive me! Don't be crazy! Sit up and listen. Listen, this is the secret! No word of this to Old Zsolt! Before Zsolt there was Pete. Because I was lonely, feeling alienated and I needed Pete, So at the age of 14, I was his. Pete left me, but I didn't cry afterward. But I got lonely again and feeling alienated. Good old Zsolt wouldn't get it. But Annie, of all of the thirty some men afterward... I never loved anybody as much as that Pete. - What are you laughing at? - I didn't say a thing. Funny. Sounded like gargling... Nandi is snoring... hm. I'm so nervous, I need a smoke. Funny, like somebody gargling. I have to go. We'll both say our 'I do', and that will be for life. Oh, Zsolt! You must never know that I'm marrying you to get revenge on my true love, Bertalan! This is a real insult, Bertalan! You recognized my beauty but... you belittled my education, and called me a simple mid-level apparatchik. But Zsolt is waiting for me! You can be late for the movies, the ushers won't scold you. And clapping late at the curtain of a theatre play is Fine. Fields waiting for spring, sleep beneath the snow, Day and night are so patient, The sun and the moon are so slow. But run! And rush! And scratch! And bite! And don't try to save your voice. If he rings, if he calls if he says it's good here and he'll share your troubles. That's a dream! - But here's the ring on my hand. That's a dream! - It's time for a celebration. That's a dream! - You're wrong if you're thinking... I can only receive, and I can't give! But run! And rush! And scratch! And bite! That's a dream! - But here's the ring on my hand. That's a dream! - It's time for a celebration. That's a dream! You're wrong if you think I can only get, and I can't give! As many long years go by, As flames die to embers, I'll glow. The passion will go, but I'll have devotion. That's a dream! - Here's the ring on my Finger. That's a dream! - It's time for a celebration. That's a dream! You're wrong if you think that I can only receive, and I can't give! It'll be good to listen to his coughing, and give him a quiet nod. Or laugh about nothing. Or call him by his pet name. A nice present on my birthday. A book, some english linen. Sometimes it will be fine to make fun of our common friends. If he explains or scolds me, I'll devotedly listen, 'Don't you be such a wild one, and try not to act so ignorant.' It'll be good to listen to his coughing, and give him a quiet nod. Or laugh about nothing. Or call him by his pet name. You'll be my loyal companion, You know, I'm a twice failed suicide. Because loneliness is murder. But now I'll have a man beside me. He isn't getting a bad deal. I really do love him with all my heart. That qualified window dresser! I love his sense of humor, his gentle heart, his bony face, his balding head, his husky voice, his bachelor whimsies! Zsolt! Give me your hand... and stay with me until the very end! This comic, tragic drama! Passion is bittersweet. The curtain falls. This comic, tragic drama! One day all dreams end. The curtain falls. This is the life of a diver: Bottles and oxygen! Those words, I thought, you can't... how would ever you understand? This is the life of a diver: Bottles and oxygen! Those words, I thought, you can't... how would you ever understand? Come on, Diver! Truly, how deep is this soul? Reach out your hand to me and you will see. This comic, tragic drama! Passion is bittersweet. The curtain falls. This comic, tragic drama!

Those words, I thought, you can't... how would ever you understand? Diver, Oh! Truly how deep is the soul? - I've gone for a walk by the Danube. - Fine, go on! ONE YEAR LATER Zsolt! Welcome! Anna Paradi, Med school freshman? That's me. Come on in! So glad to see you. How's the baby? He must be big! And Klari's health? - I hardly get to see you and Klari. - We noticed. We talk about you often. - Unfortunately... - University keeps you busy! Listen, If I lift something heavy, and my back hurts for a week if I bend over. - What could that be? - Age! You're getting rusty. Like us all. I'm taking this Phormifer, Pharmifor... you know a pharmi... Pharmifor. Listen, darling, next week we're having the christening. - The baby's christening! Wow! - Anni, you're our closest friend. You're the only godmother we could imagine? Nobody else. Understand? No-body. There's a little party afterward, at the company, it's a formality... Anni, Klari is terribly nervous. She's taking that Flexaron, Flexiren... ...but they shouldn't make fun of me. Zsolt, I am who I am! - I remember, last year... Leave me alone. It's idiotic. Why should I be somebody else? This is a strict self-examination! But you're right. Here at home, there's this... invisible membrane around you. - What membrane? - Everybody's surrounded by one. Sure. That's why it's so hard to establish human relationships. - We shouldn't be surprised if... You and me, we couldn't break through- - No, we couldn't. Even though... - we'd have been good together. - Klari! Look if Klari couldn't... Well, if she knows one thing sure... She really can break through that membrane. I envy her. I envy you. - There was Charley, then an Andrew. - Was? Only was? Bad memories. Neither lasted a week. Let's forget it. Darling Anna, you and your standards. You expect so much, you're too picky! I am not. I'm just not made for life. All I'm going to say is: Come on down off your high horse. We warmly welcome dear mothers and fathers, godmothers and godfathers, guests and the little ones. We're gathered here for a real celebration of joy. To greet these new lives, our future hopes, the little people who will carry on our work and continue our fight to realize our dreams for our future of this world. I'd like to announce that Miklos Alaki and his wife, Zsuzsanna had a baby in Budapest, in 1979... I'm just saying, Annie's a good example. And if anyone dared hurt her, I'd... Too bad she has glasses. What do you think? Is it a disadvantage for a woman to wear glasses? Say something. Don't you envy Annie? For her spiritual power. Her sense of purpose. I do admit I envy her, friend. She'll have her degree in no time. What I wouldn't give for one. I know you're in love with Annie. A little. The beautiful spinster. But I'm not jealous of her. Well, yes, I am jealous! Where are the baby vitamins? Oh, here they are. Where's the bubble bath? It's not on the vanity shelf? Wait, I'll get it for you. I owe you a confession. I've... deceived you. Yes, I admit it. I've deceived you. I mean, I sent in an application. I applied to the medical university. Zsolt! I want to become a doctor, too! THE END
