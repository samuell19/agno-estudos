Come on! Let's go, let's go! Get them, Michael! Go, Michael. Ian, get to the ball! Alec, run! If you won't run, get off the field! Can you believe he's humiliating a kid? It's not the world cup. They're just kids! Shh! Kid probably didn't want to play. Honey, look. It's Michael. Yeah! Yes! Yes! Get him, Michael! Get him but be careful! Go, Michael! Go! Go! Go, Michael. Son, let the other boys get hurt, too. Get it! Yeah, yeah, yeah! He's open! I sense an injury developing. Go and get it! Hurry up! Hurry! Come on! Get it! Michael, you can get him! Uh! Hurry up! Come on! Oh! Oh, foul! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Are you o.K., baby? How many fingers is this? Three. Are you o.K.? He hit me in the ribs. Get back in there and get even, all right? What do you think I should do, dad? I think you should stay here and catch your breath. It's just a stupid game. I was trying to protect him. Oh, come on. He's shooting baskets now? Yeah, he's upset. He shoots baskets when he's upset. See, this is what I hate about sports. A few kids feel great. Everybody else feels like garbage. It's not just sports. You need to spend more time with him. I just took him to the movies yesterday. I mean guy stuff. Oh, boy. This isn't about going camping again, is it? I see him on the playground. He lacks confidence around the boys. Donna, he's just like me. He's artistic. Not everybody's cut out for that Steven seagal stuff. There is a place in the world for sensitive men, you know-- Michelangelo, Da Vinci, Mozart, bill moyers. We've all made our contribution without killing an animal. I just think he needs more male-oriented activities to boost his self-esteem. Otherwise, he could end up like... Like me? I didn't say that. You were thinking it. I was trying not to. So, what are you saying? I'm failing him as a father? Oh, of course not. You're a wonderful father in most ways. You took him miniature golfing 15 times last year. In a couple sundays, I'll take him in the mountains, and we'll go hiking. That would be a start. Good. I got plenty of male animal in me. Oh, you do? I've demonstrated that to you. Ha ha ha! Mmm. Talk to him during dinner. Tell him something to make him feel better. You can count on me. You know who the biggest sports fans are? Orthopedic surgeons. They make a fortune sewing these guys up. One shot in the knees, and the guy's finished-- 2 minutes of glory, 40 years of agony. Thanks. Want some more? No. Why don't you show him that letter, hmm? What letter? You and Michael have been invited to go on a camping trip. Camping trip? Mm-hmm. Who would invite me on a camping trip? My school. Your entire school is going camping? No. Just his class. The boys and their fathers have been invited to go to Catalina island for the weekend to camp buffalo valley. No kidding. Mmm. It's called a dad and lad weekend. Isn't that cute? Oh, that's adorable. They'll sleep in tents. Wow--tents. I guess you want to go on this. Of course he wants to go. He doesn't want to be the only boy who doesn't go. I was asking Michael. All the other kids are going. With their fathers. It would look really bad if Michael didn't show up. Right. It would be terrible if you were the only kid that didn't go. The other fathers are going? All of them. Well, then we'll go, too. This isn't a psych? No. No, not at all. It'll be fun. I've never slept in a tent before. Yeah, and you know, I hear Catalina island is beautiful. Movie stars go there. Hey, we'll do it-- rock-'n'-roll. This is going to be so cool, dad. I'm going to go call all my friends. I'm going to die over there. You know that. Do me a favor. Could you pack my aspirin, insect repellent, and allergy medicine and a cyanide pill in case things get bad? It's two nights on Catalina island. Two nights where I won't get a wink of sleep. I get claustrophobic inside a sleeping bag. Inside a sleeping bag. That's why I wouldn't go to Woodstock. No sleep-- that won't kill you. I really feel like a wuss. You might enjoy this. I spent one day in camp my entire childhood. I know. And a bully ate your lunch and stole your pocketknife. Your mother said you didn't have to go back. Your father was too busy drinking to care, and that's why you're the bundle of neuroses that you are today. Help me. I am not whining. Actually, I'm grateful for my neuroses, you know. I'm a writer. I depend on traumatic childhood memories in order to be creative. Times like this, though, I wish I was more like your brother-- brain-dead and devoid of emotion. [Michael] I'm ready! All right. Me, too-- raring to go. I'd rather get a prostate exam than go on this trip. I hate that about myself. I'm working on liking myself better. I'm working on everything. Well, your father survived the korean war. I'm sure you'll survive this. My father won the korean war single-handedly. I wish he were alive to take Michael to camp. He'd jump out of the plane to get there. Go! All right, Donna, if they medevac me back, take me to ucla, not some clinic with people who have tuberculosis. You got it, stud. Catalina island, here we come. Man, here we go. You have fun, o.K.? Buckle up. Bye, honey. Why did they have to pick a Friday night for this trip? The whole city left town on a Friday night. Oh, man. What are you looking at? What's this for? Uh, never mind. If somebody beats me up, can we go home? I was going to ask you the same question. Michael, nobody's going to beat you up. I remember a time a bully beat me up. My dad started giving me boxing lessons. That's why I had these bonded. We're never going to move. Oh, great. Would you look at this guy's truck? What's the point of having that in Los Angeles? That's chip Johansen and his dad. They're going on the trip. Why does he need a four-wheel drive? To survive the savage wilderness of Burbank? Dad, you're not going to put everybody down over there, right? No, of course not. You know how when we go out for a pizza, and you get mad because we have to wait a long time, and you complain to the manager? You're not going to do that at camp, right? This is just a weekend. I'm totally chilled out. Nothing will bother me, o.K.? The guy's got 14 extra headlights. Where's he going? To Jupiter? [Honk honk] Hey, you guys, watch where you're going! Oh, man. Look at this place. Hey, ed, are you sailing tomorrow night? Can you believe this? I give up. Oh, god. I don't know. Your mother said-- Michael! Michael! I could use a hand here. Don't worry about me. I live for your pleasure. O.k. Excuse me. Hey, over there! Give me it! Excuse me. Oh, man! Ugh! Oh, gosh! Ugh! Have a little accident? I think I'm fine. Let me help you out-- always prepared. Oh. Oh. Uh... Have we ever met before? Third-grade parents' day. Oh, that's right. You're, like, an FBI agent. Deputy sheriff. I think you got that. Thank you. You're a musician or something? I'm a writer. Yeah, I knew it was some hippie job. Uh, so, uh, you guys going camping, too? Mother/daughter camp-out. These broads drive me nuts. They can't go anywhere without their hair-dryers. You know the type. Yeah. Jo and me--we brought our rock-climbing gear, survival tents, hiking boots. We'll do some exploring, right, Jo? Catch you later, bud. Take care. Hey, dad, the boat-- it's so cool. The trip takes three hours. You're kidding. Want pizza? No. I just had some. [Horn blows] Attention, please. The Catalina express... That's us. What did he say? Just tell them you're in the fourth grade. Michael, I could use some help here. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you, son. Proceed to the loading dock. Yeah, I got it. All right, campers. Just stack your gear neatly in the pile inside the boat. Now, I hope everyone remembered to write their names on their sleeping bags. We're all friends here, but no sense setting the table for temptation. Know what I mean? Michael, you could carry something. I don't want to go. You were looking forward to this. I changed my mind. Look, your mother says we have to go, so we're going. Hike! Oh! Boy in the water! Just hang on a second. Boy in the water! [Blowing whistle] Who is that kid? I'll pull you in. This is no way to start the weekend, son! This is a good place. Let's sit by the window. The sun will set soon-- great time to start a three-hour boat trip. Hi. Mind if we buddy up with you guys? Oh, gee, that'd be perfect. Great. [Horn blows] We're going to move! Brent, you're going to lose-- hi. I'm Aaron deutsch. Spenser Paley. You're the writer, aren't you? Want to make something of it? No. That's great. You're doing what you want. I'm a film editor-- well, I was. I'm trying to move into commercial real estate, which is crazy-- the economy being what it is-- but you got to pay the bills. That's what life's all about-- trying to make the best of things after you fail at what you love. Michael, want to get something to eat, son? Sure. Anybody catch the Dodgers' score? Not that I think they won today. The line-up isn't hitting worth anything. I'm hanging in for football season. Know what I mean? Yeah. I'm going to get some food. Excuse me. Avoid the chili. The burritos are good. [Burp] Hi. Which are better-- the ranch-style salad-dressing potato chips or the onion-soup-dip flavored potato chips? You know what? I'll take one of each and two root beers. Hi. I'm married. [Bag rustling] I'm sorry. [Crunching loudly] [Horn honking] We're here--Catalina island! Wake up, you sleepyheads! Grab your gear and assemble on deck. The fun begins now. Come on, Michael. We're here. The fun begins now. What time is it? Oh, jeez, it's almost midnight. It's crazy to keep 10-year-olds up this late. We'll get to bed soon. Come on. There it is! Hey, watch who you're pushing. This is it? I feel like we're landing in Vietnam. You were in 'nam? No. It was all volunteer by the time I came up. How about you? Marines. My father was in desert storm. Wow. Great job. He's a fire fighter and a paramedic. If I burst into flames here, I'll call you. Come on, chip. Let's go get our stuff. Step out. You got everything? This is so neat. Where's our flashlight, dad? Dump your gear under the sign and wait at the end of the road. Dump your gear under the sign and wait at the end of the road. Dump your sign-- I mean gear-- under the sign and wait at the end of the road. Dump your sign-- whatever. [Blows whistle] Put your gear under the sign and gather on the road. Why? We're trying to stick to a schedule, sir. We'd all like to get to bed soon. Where is the camp? I can't see anything. [Horn honks] Let's bring that truck down here now. Everyone, get off the road. Watch out for this drop-off here. Bring it down here. You having a good time, Michael? This is cool, huh? Oh, yeah. Let's all pitch in and toss this gear into the truck. We just finished tossing it on the ground. Do what he says. Sometimes, it's important to question authority. But all the time? That's it. Everybody pitches in. Everybody helps. As soon as we get the truck loaded, we can hike to the camp. Hike? For those of you on your first visit here, the road gets narrow, especially where it winds along the cliffs. This is insane. Dad, be quiet! So make sure you all have your flashlights. If we keep up a good pace, we should meet the truck in the camp in, oh, 45 minutes. You'll have all these kids taking a hike in the middle of the night? Who's the wimp? Dad, I'm not tired. Can't we take the truck? Because my arches-- that's a good point. For insurance reasons, no one can ride in the truck. But it's o.K. To hike in total darkness? Toss the wuss back on the ferry! Dad, you're embarrassing me. Don't worry. Why can't we take a ride in those boats over there? Sir, the water taxis are to take the girls to their camp. Why is this idiot in charge? You'd want to be? [Blows whistle] Take off, driver. If everybody's ready, let's light up those flashlights and get marching-- two by two, quick time. Ho! [Blowing whistle] Come on! Check it out! It's a 45-minute hike. The camp's a couple miles away. What other choice do we have? You know, $50 for all 4 of us wasn't bad. Sir, I guess you probably make a lot of money doing this. The little guy Peter out? My daddy didn't want us-- Michael, try and relax, son. You're very, very tired. Tomorrow morning, nobody will remember that we didn't hike over with them, o.K.? Just rest, my son. Careful. So this is it? We don't have to walk any further? Well, this is it-- what there is left of it. Thanks for the ride. In case you want to leave early, call me. Thank you. Good night. I guess all our problems are over now. Can we go home now? Come on. Let's go, guys. Gee, it's dark. Ow! What happened? I stepped on something. What? Do we want to know? Here's a tent. Now I know what they did with the equipment from the Spanish- American war. Great. This must be the four-star dining accommodations. Hey, there's our stuff. There is a god. O.k., there it is. There it is. Thanks. We're here first. We can pick the best tent. They're all the same. Oh. So, what do you think? You know, maybe we should look for a better one. Michael? I guess this one's fine. O.k. Aw. O.k., Michael. [Kiss] [Zipping up sleeping bag] I knew this was going to happen. No. No, thank you. [Cough cough] Ahem. [Clunk] [Squeaking] Please don't let it rain tonight. Michael? Michael, wake up. What? We lived through the night. Come on. Let's go hit the showers. I smell like a bait boat. Michael, don't do that. You're not home. Get up. Michael? Michael? There's only one stall open. O.k. Watch it. It's slippery. How you doing? Fabulous. I'll bring my wife here for our anniversary. Funny guy. Keep your flip-flops on, all right? O.k., dad. Turn it on all the way. It's on all the way. You're kidding. I don't feel dirty. You feel that dirty? No. Let's go. I don't know. Probably pancakes or something. It's been about six hours. They were supposed to serve breakfast at 7:30. It's almost 8:00. You said nothing would bother you. Anybody get any sleep? Michael slept pretty well. You snored. I slept? The cots are hard. Our floor is wet. Don't be a wuss. Stop that. He is. Fine. Don't call him that. Crickets in our tent drove me nuts. Good morning, men! Good morning. It's been a half-hour. When do we eat? We're working on it. How do you work on breakfast? Just burn some toast and throw it at us. [Laughter] I'm sure it'll be just a few minutes more. That's my gym teacher. I have him all year. Don't make him hate me. I won't make anybody hate you. Just relax. Do you have French toast? My son doesn't like scrambled eggs. I like 'em. You never eat them. I like 'em, dad. If you could do me a favor-- here's 5 bucks. Fry my kid a couple eggs. I can't touch anything except this spoon. I see. Well, you're doing a fabulous job. I'll submit your name to represent my district in congress. Ha ha. Ha ha. The coffee's pretty good, huh? How was the water-taxi ride, baby? You said no one would remember. No more boat rides. We won't even take the ferry back tomorrow. We'll swim like dolphins. They ran out of food. They ran out of food? We got prunes and tang. Don't combine those two. It could cause a nuclear reaction inside your stomach. They got this food where they got those tents. They say make sure you're prepared-- to order a pizza. If you don't like it, get out of here. I don't think anybody wants to leave. I do. We're just joking around. Try that at the firehouse. The food's pretty bad. Look, my kid really looks forward to coming here every year. Now, I don't want it ruined by girls who can't stand a little inconvenience. Humor might make the situation more fun for everybody. It's a school camp-out. We're not retaking Kuwait. You're knocking the war? No. No, not at all. Thank goodness we got that emir back on the throne. I'm going to watch you. Thanks. If I do anything funny, take my picture. That guy will kill your dad. [Honks] Good morning. I'd like to make a couple of announcements. ♪ Announcements, announcements, announcements ♪ ♪ what a heck of a way to start the day ♪ ♪ announcements ♪ ♪ announcements, announce-- ♪ Oh, boy. You campers really got me that time. I won't make that mistake again. I do have just a few brief...Notices. Please don't throw stones into the cove. It took mother nature millions of years to wash all those stones up on the beach. If each of us throws six stones into the water, there'll be no stones left there. And the world would come completely to an end. You'll get us in trouble! Sorry. Also, campers, the west drainage basin is now officially open for volleyball and, uh, other kinds of ball. That would be the swamp. Dad! Sorry. Our first activity this morning is archery. We'll see you at the range in 10 minutes. Did anyone find those bows and arrows? Right. Well, we'll stay on top of that. And finally, remember that we are guests here at this camp, and...and what, campers? Good campers are good guests. Leave this camp the way you found it. A toilet. Dad! Sorry again. Nice shot! Right in the middle! All right! Yeah. They have fancy bows. We got this kid stuff. They brought their own. Nobody said we could do that. We would have brought our own. We don't have our own bows. But we could have rented some. Have you done this before? Sure. A couple times. What do I do? Watch me carefully, o.K.? You simply take the arrow and rest the back of it on this little doohickey thing here on the bow. Then you shoot, right? No. Uh, Michael, you know what the secret to archery is? It's mental preparation, o.K.? You have to really just close your eyes and imagine the arrow flying through the air and hitting the target. You look stupid. I may look stupid, but I'm not really stupid. This is ancient zen Buddhist philosophy. This will work. Just watch. I just draw back on the arrow here, and my mind is at peace-- it's better if you're not talking-- and then-- and then I just let go. The ancient zen masters didn't care if they hit the target if their mind was at peace. Your turn? Sure. O.k., carefully take an arrow. Put this up. O.K. Now, just clear your mind and let your thoughts guide the arrow. All right! Practically a bull's-eye. It's not him. It's his equipment. They said we weren't supposed to use the canoes unless somebody was watching us. I'm watching us. Here, grab an oar. It's a paddle, dad. Of course. Turn around. I could have been a championship canoer if I had done it more than once. All right. O.k., here we go. [Groaning] Um, dad, we're going to hit the rocks. This isn't working. I'm paddling hard. You're doing great. You know what the secret to canoeing is? It's teamwork. We paddle on opposite sides. That gets us going straight. You got it. There's a rock under us. Stay away from the rocks. Away from the rocks. Away from the rocks. Say it with me. Think zen-- think away from rocks. Away from the rocks. Let the rock hear you. Stay away from the rocks. O.k., here we go. Go! Go! Row! I'm rowing! Uh-oh! Don't worry. I did this once-- in a dream. Get away from that rock. I'll get us out of this. Here we go. Paddle. O.k. Paddle, son. I'm paddling. Whoa! Don't worry about it. We're moving now. Here we go. I'll do the other side. O.k. We know how to do this. Excellent, excellent. Try the other side. Want to race? You're on! First one to the buoy wins. Let's not race, dad. We have to, son. We don't want them to think we're wusses. O.k., let's get going, boy. O.k. O.k. Oh, very good. Come on! On your Mark, get set, go! Michael, give it all you got! I'm trying! You're slowing us down. Sorry! You're getting it all in my glasses! Put the paddle in. You're holding us back. I'm sorry! You're getting me wet! Michael! Oh, man, she's way ahead. You're getting me soaked! Come on! We're not going fishing! You're rocking the boat, dad. I'm not rocking the boat. We can't let them win. Michael, you're getting it all over my glasses! Sorry! You've got to steer. You wanted to do this! Think zen. Think-- I'm coming up front to steer. Uh, dad! You're rocking the boat! Whoa! Oh! Oh! Michael? Dad! Oh, now we're in trouble. Oh, no! Bail. I think we want to go towards shore, son. It's that way. Don't worry about it. You should have worn your life jacket. I'm floating. I got some buoyancy. I still think $400 is a little steep for a 30-year-old canoe. Attention. the father/son penatha-- the father/son pethanta-- what's this word? Pentathlon. Pentathlon. You just want to concentrate. That's all it is. So this is where my breakfast went. This will redeem us for the canoe. And the archery and the water taxi. Look, it's one race. I'll do the best I can. Thank you. These things poached? The four relays are the first parts of the pentath--yeah-- to be followed by the basketball competition this afternoon. Each dad and lad will receive points based on their times in the relays. We're going to lose. No, we're not. I have my master's degree. In journalism. We're going to lose. I won't be the laughingstock of this camp. On your Mark... Get set...Go! Go! Run, dad! I'm one with the egg. I'm watching the egg. Come on, dad! Don't drop it! Oh! Ooh, I feel like humpty dumpty. Come on, dad! Let's go! Come on, dad! Come on, dad! Go! Go! Go! Go, chip! Go! Get it by the-- put it on here! Go! Michael, go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Pick it up! Come on, Michael! Pick it up! Come on! That-away! Come on, dad! Watch it, kid! Go! Go! Come on, dad! O.k. Whoa! Go, dad! I'm fine. O.k., get it. O.K., my foot's stuck. Out of his way! Careful! Careful! Go, chip! Go! Go! Go! Go! Keep going! Watch your balance! I'll get ready with the M&M's. Uh! Suck, dad! Suck! I'm sucking. I'm sucking. Suck, dad! Suck! Suck harder, dad! Suck! Something's wrong with my straw. Go, dad! Go, dad! Go! Go! Go, Brent! Go for it! Go, Brent! O.k., it's a rhythm thing. You're doing good. Remember what I told you about being zen? I'm trying! I'm trying! You can't do zen in the three-legged race. Hut! Hut! Hut! Hop! I got you. Yeah! Yeah! Are you o.K.? Did we win? Yay! Yay! Woo! Woo! You all right? Yeah. Watch your step there. I see a lizard. When we get home, I'm getting back into shape. I'll tell your mother to stop hanging the dry cleaning on the exercise bike. We got a chance at winning this pentathlon today. The neanderthals are only a few points ahead. With basketball this afternoon, I can close the gap. You said winning didn't matter, that it's just a stupid game. I don't want you to become some overly competitive jerk. What are you? I'm enjoying the weekend. I'm having a good time. If we drive that guy Chet and his son, chip, into the dirt, so much the better. I can't talk to you. Now you sound like your mother. All right, men, as quickly as you can, let's gather down here. Gather in here. Now, dads and lads, before this next activity, I just have one announcement. ♪ Announcements, announcements, announcements ♪ ♪ what a heck of a way to start the day ♪ ♪ announcements ♪ Oh, you're just too quick for me, but now for one of the most unusual and exciting features of our camp buffalo valley-- a real, authentic abandoned silver mine. Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! This is a real silver mine that was actually worked first by the Spanish in the 1700s and then, oh, 130 years ago by two Americans who really mined real silver right here. I'm sure you remember our friend Mr. George rosebrock. Hello, George! Gentlemen. Hi, George. Hi, George. Mr. Rosebrock has agreed to take us on a tour deep into the bowels of this mine. Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! This is so cool-- a real silver mine. Maybe there's bats. And salamanders. So for those of you who don't suffer from claustrophobia... Let's check out those flashlights and go down in the mine. Isn't this great? Yeah. How bad can it be? They're letting kids go in there. For a mine, it's probably very spacious. I'll go anywhere I don't have to hop. What if we get trapped in there? Once on TV this guy was checking out a mine, and he got stuck in this crack. They had to lower food and water in a bucket. Then the mine collapsed, and he was buried alive. Michael, please. Nothing like that will happen. A friend and I were exploring a cave, and he got stuck-- will you shut up! I'll shut up. [Scoutmaster] Fathers, be careful as you enter the mine because the ceiling is very, very low. I guess the airy, spacious part is inside. I'm an old spelunker from way back. [George] All right, gentlemen, if you're ready, follow me into the very bowels of the earth. Here we go. [Spenser] I'm thinking airy, spacious-- airy and spacious. I feel air. It looks spacious. [Spenser] Duck down, Michael. This first shaft was carved by the Spanish and their Indian guides some 200 years ago out of solid rock, and somehow these old walls are still holding up. So with any luck, we may get out of here alive. Ha ha ha! Now, once there was two men that were mining this claim, and one of them got to suspecting that the other was stealing silver and hiding it in an abandoned shaft deep in the recesses of the mines. Ooh! Deep in the mine with no hope of ever getting out, they became the mole people! Ha ha ha! [George] This will be a tight squeeze, so watch your heads, and we'll go through one at a time. Here we go. Oh, boy. If you weren't careful, you could get stuck. Come on, dad. Hey, spense, you o.K.? Spenser, spenser... Hey, dad, what's the matter? Help him up, somebody. There's something wrong. What's wrong? Scared? Out of the way. Spenser, spenser, it's Aaron. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Spenser. [Boy] He fainted. [Doctor] What's the boy's name? [Father] Spenser. You have a nasty break, spenser. I'll have to set the bone, so I want you to put your arm out as straight as you can. This may hurt a little. Be a man, son. Be a man, son. Be a man, son. Be a man, son. Be a man, son. [Scoutmaster] Feeling better? [Aaron] Too close, huh, spense? Where are my glasses? Thank you. Where am I? You're in my tent. I'm glad you're better. We've never had a father faint before. I didn't faint. You looked like you fainted. Dad, are you o.K.? I'm fine. I just got a little dizzy. It was probably something I ate. It had to be. Perhaps you should go to your tent and rest. I don't need to rest. I'm fine. Is it 106 in here? I'd be o.K. If I wasn't in this sauna. All right, so, what's next? Well, everybody's at the beach. Then we're there, too. These are fascinating. You ever smell one? I'll steal some and put them under your mom's nose when she snores. Let's get our suits on. Be careful, Mr. Paley. First thing you do is hock one in here-- some spit. Then move that loogie around in there. That will clear off your lenses. Great. [Michael] Can we try scuba diving? Scuba diving? You don't want to do that. That's very, very dangerous. You got to be certified. You need $10,000 worth of equipment. It's very, very dangerous. Your mom doesn't want us doing that. Snorkeling is better, and your lungs don't explode. I bet I can spot more fish than you. Uh, o.K.? Yeah! Hey, they're loving it, man. I can't see anything. It's too muddy. I know. This stinks. I'm going to mess around with the guys. I'll be working on my sunburn. Be safe. Hey, spense. Hey. So, what's wrong with scuba diving? I don't know. What? Nothing's wrong with it. It's a little dangerous. A lot of things worth doing are dangerous. Like what? Like scuba diving. There's more adventurous ways to spend time with our sons than the movies. You know, I'm starting to realize what the point of this whole weekend is-- to prove we're lousy fathers. [Tweet] [Tweet] [Tweet] Excuse me, sir. I believe we asked everyone not to throw stones into the cove. What? Oh. I'm sorry. I forgot. I will not do it again. I just have to ask you to retrieve the stone and put it on the beach. You're joking. If you get away with it, everybody will throw stones. The beach will be destroyed. You want me to go into the water and find that rock? Yes. Or you and your son have to leave the beach. Are you going to dust for fingerprints and find out which one's mine? Find a stone similar to the stone you threw and put that back on the beach. O.k. Fine. You want your power play? You can have it. I'm going in. I'm finding a rock. Here's a rock of similar size and weight. Call the Sierra club. The rock is back. That's it. I'm sorry, but technically that rock was still on the beach. Wade out. Pick up a rock. Or would you prefer I call the harbor patrol? The harbor patrol? Are you nuts? Will they show up in a speedboat and arrest me? Ow! I stepped on something. I've been poisoned. [Tweet] [Tweet] [Tweet] Jellyfish! Jellyfish! Everyone out of the water! Jellyfish! [Man] Sam, come on! Let's go! Come on, Mr. Paley. Let's go to first aid. [Scoutmaster] Come on! I'm fine. It's a little sting. Brent, get out of the water! Michael, you and Brent know where to find me. Come on! Don't hold me so tight. Just watch your-- I'm fine! Ow! Jeez. Come on. Sorry, sir. These jellyfish stings are nothing to mess around with. It's o.K. Treating these stings is our policy. What is our next activity? Basketball, but I don't think-- we'll win that pentathlon. What about your sting? It's fine. Winning that pentathlon is my policy. Come on. Call it, Mr. Paley. Heads-- no, tails. Heads it is. Half-court rules. First team to seven baskets wins. [Tweet] O.k. Listen to me. What we need here is teamwork. Pass the ball to me. What did he say? Pass the ball to him. Just like in school. "Don't shoot or we'll beat you up." Is that foot well enough to play on? It's fine. Blow the whistle. [Tweet] Uh! [Cheering] The score-- Johansen, one basket to zip. Maybe we should just quit now. It's only a game. We're going to win it, Michael. You'll get him next time. Score--two baskets to zip. [Spenser] Michael. Don't be mad at me. I didn't do anything. I'm sorry. Here's what we'll do. Let me take a shot. I'll pass to you. I'll get underneath the basket. Shoot high to me. I'll just catch it and pop it in. Dad, I can make the outside shot. It's very risky. You can't depend on it. You Chuck it to me. Go ahead and shoot. What? It's just like baseball and soccer. We're supposed to be the ones having fun, but they end up telling us what to do. I say go for it. Michael! [Brent] Come on, Michael, let's go. Michael! Let's go! Let's go! Come on, Michael! Shoot, Michael, shoot! [Cheering] Paley scores. 2-1. You got the shot, you take it, o.K.? Thanks, dad.

Before the evening ends, there are a few things I'd like to say. Boo! Now, hold on a minute. I always give a speech at the campfire. We're trying to stop you. Spenser should give a speech. At least he's funny. [Cheering] Dad, just don't embarrass me, o.K.? When have I ever-- o.k. I won't embarrass you. I promise. O.K. All right. [Cheering] That's not necessary. If you'll pardon me, I know what the problem is. It's your uniform. Did I spill something on it? No. If you'll forgive me, it separates you from us. We're relaxed, sitting around the campfire. You look like a cop. What do you mean? You need to be a leader, but you need a relaxed image. Right? Yeah! Yeah! What kind of an image would that be? May I demonstrate with your outfit? Yes. Go ahead. Let's hear it for a good sport. [Cheering] Take off your clothes. No, no-- just your shirt. Take off your shirt. You're kidding. Want him to do it? Yeah! Yeah! O.k. All right. It's a lovely shirt. You have that beautiful choker with the medal-- I made that. [Spenser] That's fabulous. No sweat stains. You're impressive. I never sweat. Tom Jones impression. Catch, ladies. O.k. That looks great. Let's put your suspenders back on. Let's go all the way over. O.k. One more. Here we go-- over again. Isn't that fabulous? Yeah! That didn't hurt, did it? No. And the final finish. Isn't that more relaxed? Yeah! Yeah! [Spenser] Should he finish his speech? Yeah! Yeah! Thank you. Excuse me. Coming through. Dad, he looks like a jerk. But did I embarrass you? No. Then I kept my promise. [Scoutmaster] I don't know. I... I guess I just wanted to say that I know that I will always... Always remember the camping trips I took with my dad. What was important was that we did them together. That's what these weekends are about-- bringing fathers and sons together. And that's something that we need to do once in a while. Something just hit me. What? I'm having a really good time. [Scoutmaster] The games we've played-- those aren't what matters here. If you have gotten to know each other just a little bit better and gotten just a little bit closer, then believe me, this weekend has been a success, and you're all winners. Now, in the morning, we'll have our treasure hunt in the silver mine. Aw, yeah. That's awesome. We're going into the mine? [Scoutmaster] Yes, sir. Thank you all, and good night. Dad, we don't have to do the treasure hunt. It's no big deal. Let's not talk about tomorrow. This is one of the best nights... [Michael] Aw, man. What happened? Maybe a bear got in there. There are no bears here. Maybe a cat. I think I know what happened. It's just some good-natured hazing. We'll help you clean up, pitch your tent back up. Excuse me. Dad, it's o.K. Guess you thought that was funny. What do you mean? You trashing my tent. Oh, that. It's a tradition here. First-time visitors get their tents trashed. I wouldn't take it personally. Look, if you don't like me, that's fine, but if you have a problem, don't be a coward and go after my son. Let's just forget about it. We've had such a nice night. Are you calling me a coward? Only a coward would do that to a kid. Dad, come on, don't... Let's not start anything here. O.k. Michael, let's go. Are you running away? Get out of my way. [Aaron] Stop it! Come on, guys. [Michael] Stop! [Aaron] Break it up. Stop it! [Scoutmaster] All right, guys, I'm not having any of this. Get up. Get up. Stop. Stop. Stop! [Scoutmaster] All right, Mr. Paley, let's go to first aid and patch you up again. I'm fine, Michael. Michael! [Aaron] I'll go after Michael. Get your nose fixed. You're not the first person who's suggested that. You know, Mr. Paley, I'm starting to hope that you don't come back again next year because this camp can't afford to take care of you for another weekend. Michael, where were you? I was worried. I took a walk. You want to go canoeing tomorrow? That last time was a freak accident. Forget it. How about archery, then? We didn't really focus on it before. The zen thing was fun. I want to go home. Why? We've still got another day. I want to go home! En garde, dad. Oh! Hey, Michael... Look, I've been a jerk this weekend. I know that. I'm not that good at this dad stuff, but if there's one thing I've learned this weekend, I've realized it doesn't matter what happened to me as a kid. I'm here to help you become a man. I'm scared that if you and I don't work this out while you're still my boy, one day you'll have to come back here or a place like this by yourself. Look, dad, I don't want to hear about it. Listen to me. You might not understand what I'm trying to tell you, but sorting this stuff out when you're a grownup-- it's harder than you can imagine. I still want to go home. Look... If I go in the mine and we look for treasure, will you finish the weekend? You'll just faint again. Then I'll sniff my smelling salts and pull myself together. I want us to find that treasure. You two going back? O.k. Thank you. We've changed our minds. That will still be $3.00. No problem. Each. All right, here you go. That's a good boy you got. You're lucky. I know. Just in case. Thanks. O.k., Michael, let's go. Michael? Michael, you know, you could help me. You could help me sometimes. Just grab a sleeping bag. You have 30 minutes. Watch out for bats. May the best pair win. [Tweet] Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! I'm right behind you, buddy. Aw, again. Again. Watch your head, dad. Are you o.K.? Yeah, I'm fine, Michael. Should we go back? No. No. Let's keep going. Dad, look. These boards are loose. They might be holding this place up. There's another tunnel in here. Yeah. Let's keep going, o.K., Michael? Somebody stuck these here. They're not nailed. Leave them alone. The treasure's here. These boards are to fool us. This isn't a good idea. Michael. I'm positive. Come on. Come on, dad. Michael! Michael... Michael! Come on, dad. Down here. Michael, maybe we should be heading back. I'm sure it's down here. Agh! What's wrong? Just a spider web. Remember, your mother would be going nuts now. Let's go. Is the tunnel getting narrower? I see a light. That's exciting. Don't move. You can kill it with this. No, I can't. O.k. Here. What kind of snake is that? Looks like a kingsnake. Great. That relaxes me. All right! Did I kill it? Here. Don't pick it up! It's rubber. What? Well, somebody's going to get sued. They put it there to scare us. We're in the right place. I think you're right. Excellent, dude. Cool! Let's go. Cool. This is the first mine I've seen that wasn't built by Spielberg. Look at that. Looks like someone lived here. Yeah, but not recently. Look. Roast mutton. Hey, look. Somebody's a real comedian. Ah! Michael. Treasure. Ha ha ha! Real gold! Well, I don't know about that, son. Look. Here you go. What do you think? Delicious. We found it. All right! We were here first. That's true. You can't have it. What are you doing? Hey-- uh! Aagh! Ow! Uh! Aah! Agh! Uh! Get off me! Dad! Dad! Dad, are you o.K.? Hey, answer me! Aah! Get them! Get them! Michael, are you o.K.? I think. Chip? Dad, are you o.K.? Yeah. Are you? Yeah. How about you? I don't know. I think I'm stuck. How about you? I think I'm fine. Dad, where are we? I don't know. Hold on. Let me get around here... Get around, chip. Wait a minute. Whoa. Don't anybody look down. We're in some sort of cavern... A very deep cavern. [Crack] Let's get off this ledge. I'm scared, dad. We'll get you out of here. All right, everybody just stay calm. You're the fireman. What do we do? [Wood cracks] This won't hold our weight long. Are we going to die, dad? No. No. No, we're not. Uh...o.k., see that timber? If I slide it over, maybe I can get your leg out and boost you up. O.k., let's go. Hold this flashlight. Don't take it off, o.K.? Shine it right on his foot. You guys hug the wall. [Wood bangs] Hold on. O.k. Hold on. 1, 2, 3. Aah! O.k., can you put your weight on it? I don't know yet. I think so. Come on. We got to hurry. Can you put weight on it? Yeah. I'll boost you out. You can get the kids out. Hold each other. Let's move it. Come on. Wait a minute. O.K. 1, 2... Uh! O.k. You o.K.? I got you. You're doing great. Be careful, dad. Careful, now. O.k. Got it? Yeah. Do it. Push. You ready? 1, 2, 3! Uh! I got it. Pull yourself up. Get your other foot up. O.k., o.K. Get the boys. Pass me the boys, quick. Come on, chip. Michael, hold this. O.k. I got it. Come on. Come on, buddy. Let's go. Hold on to that peg there. You o.K., Michael? Chip, just keep looking up here. I got you, man. A little more, son. Careful the way you're straddling this. Don't get a splinter. All right, that's it. That's it, buddy. Give me your hand. Right here, buddy. O.k.! Got him? Yeah, I got him. We're almost out of here. Give me the light. O.K., hold on. Come over here, son. O.K. Dad! I'm scared, dad. You're fine. I got you. Chet, don't leave. We're out of here. Come on. There you go. Keep going. Take my hand. Pull yourself up. Up. You can do it. O.K. Pull yourself up. A couple more feet. You're almost out of here. Grab ahold of Chet's hand. That's it, son. I got him. O.k., spenser. Give me your hand. I love a camping trip. I got you. Come on, dad. Dad! Let's get out of here. Hey... You, uh... Saved my kid's life. Thanks. Let's go, son. [Scoutmaster] And the treasure hunt winners are... Michael Paley and his dad spenser! Come on up, now. Come on up. Your names will be engraved on our perpetual plaque, and it will be displayed prominently in the lobby of the school for everyone to see. Now... Spense! Spense! Spense! Now, this year, we have a special award for heroism. In recognition of their courage, we're giving the paleys each a special medal for bravery... Thank you. And service to their fellow campers. All right! Congratulations. Way to go, spense. Thanks, dude. I'm going to miss you guys. Maybe we'll do it again next year. Ha ha ha! No hard feelings? No. Acting like a wimp doesn't mean you are one. Acting like a macho-- let me put it another way. I understand why this place means so much to you. It means a lot to me, too, now. I'm glad. It's the place where I had the worst scrambled eggs ever. Men, let's get this gear to the truck. Everybody pitches in. Come on! Let's go! Michael! Michael! We fell down a secret passageway and got stuck in a cavern. We could have died, but dad saved us. We got medals for being heroes. Wow, that's great! I'm not kidding. It really happened. Well, I believe you. She doesn't believe us, dad. That's her problem. We both know what happened. We know we're heroes. Yeah, we know. I said I believed you. Look at the time. You got school tomorrow. Time for bed. O.k. I'll come tuck you in. Mom, I don't need to be tucked in anymore. I'm a hero. There isn't really an abandoned mine on Catalina island, is there? Just a small one, the normal kind-- dark, dank, low ceilings, narrow, dripping fluids from the ceiling. And you went in there, with your claustrophobia? Actually, I got over it. It, uh, didn't really bother me that much. And you got trapped in there on a ledge over a bottomless cavern, and you saved Michael's life and the life of another man and his son? I did what any seasoned outdoorsman would have done. This isn't a psych, is it? They gave me a medal, didn't they? Well, all right! Ha ha ha! Does this mean we can go camping in yosemite this summer? With 10 million other people in motor homes and generators and lawn chairs? O.k., I'll think about it. I got to tell you. This was great. It was like a Greek myth. O.k., maybe not exactly, but...i really want to thank you for making me go. It was one of the best things you've done for Michael and for me. Thank you. Well, you're welcome. I'm proud of you. Thanks. This was just the beginning. Michael and I will spend more guy time together. We'll go to baseball games and basketball games. Great. Michael will love that. Next weekend, we start our scuba diving lessons. Let's check on our kid. Sc-scuba diving? I'm glad you guys bonded and everything, but when I said you should do guy things, I meant like playing catch in the driveway. Aw... Good night, pal. So what do you think of white-water rafting? This is what you always do-- you get a good idea and go overboard with it. It's a nice way to relax after bungee jumping. Let's talk about this.
