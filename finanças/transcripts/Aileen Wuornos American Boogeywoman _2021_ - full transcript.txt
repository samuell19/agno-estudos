I was telling you at dinner that I believe that money, clothes, adulation, et cetera, was a necessity with you. That some people are impelled towards an objective without even consciously knowing why. Is there something criminal in my being ambitious? Why no, criminal? Of course not. Unless your ambitions take a perverse form, and you will stop at nothing, right or wrong, to get what you want. They say the female of the species is deadlier than the male. I guess I always did dream of being famous. Grew up watching them glamorous movie stars and them black and white pictures, you know. Lana Turner. Rita Hayworth. Barbara Stanwyck. They were hot. You all doing another primetime special about me? No, this will be a documentary. So, you wanna talk about them seven pigs that I had to kill? You're known the world over. They call you Aileen Wuornos: "The Hooker From Hell", "The Damsel of Death". Personally, I like. "Angel of Death". Suits me better. We were hoping for something different. Something you've never discussed in a previous interview before. Shit, man. How many more times do I gotta go through this? I guess not many, since any day now, they'll be putting me down like a rabid bitch. Tomorrow, Aileen. Your execution is scheduled for tomorrow. So... Exclusive, huh? Inside scoop? I bet you didn't know that once upon a time, I was young and beautiful and married. Are you referring to your rather brief marriage to a wealthy yacht club president? - Commodore. - Pardon me? The head of a yacht club ain't called a "President." He's called a "Commodore." Now, do you want to hear this story or not? I do apologize. Please, go ahead. Tell us about your marriage to the Commodore. You wanna hear a story? I'll give you a goddamn story. What the fuck, bitch? I said no mouth kissin.' You said "everything." I paid for everythin'. Get off of me, motherfucker! Oh, what the fuck?! Fuck! What the fucking fuck? You knocked my fuckin' tooth out, bitch! How the fuck am I supposed to go home like this? Damn! My wife's gonna kill me! Yeah, well, tell her you got robbed. Here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna hand your wallet real slow, and then you're gonna drive the hell out of here real fast. You're a feisty one, ain'tcha? Well now, now you're gonna pay. I was different back in those days, ya know? Real ignorant about life, a lot younger. Slightly prettier too, I guess. Hey, there. What's your name? Aileen. My friends call me Lee. Well, good to meet you, Lee. I'm Jennifer. My friends call me Jen or Jenny. Take your pick. Come join us. Come on. Come on. Everybody, this is Lee. Lee, this is everybody. - Hi, Lee. - Thanks. How you doing? It's a... it's a real nice... Nice beach. Nicest private beach in Volusia County. And my pad's got the best view. So. Where are you from? Jesus, Grady. Lay off. Lee and I are just having some fun here, aren't we, Lee? That's a pretty manly name you got there. "Lee." Did your daddy call you that 'cause he couldn't tell whether you were a boy or a girl? Grady, cut it out. Mitch, can you do something. Yeah. Cool out, man. Leave her alone. Momma took off and left you when she found out you were nothing but a big, pussy-eating dyke? - Oh, God! - Oh, shit! You need to stop, you motherfucker. Get off him, get off him. Relax. Hey, hey, hey. You don't know a goddamn thing about me. I'm sorry. I'm real sorry. I-I didn't mean to ruin your party. Hey, let me take you home. - Mitch? Okay. - Yeah. Of course. Go. - Hey, Lee. - Lee, wait up. Leave me the hell alone! I don't need no trouble. Are you ever gonna grow the fuck up? Really? Because I happen to think what you did back there was totally fucking amazing. - What do you want from me? - Nothing. Well, I guess I just want to get to know you. Besides, once word about what you did gets around, you're gonna be a hero to all the girls who wish they'd had the courage to stand up to him. Hey, you got a place to crash? Well, come stay the night with me then. I've got some good weed at home. Here's to the Bicentennial and the greatest country in the world. Land of opportunity. Come on. I only came back 'cause you know, my mom got sick last year. She, uh... she died a couple months ago. Well, now my dad needs me, so, here I am. I hope you like Russian water. Okay, so now you have to tell me, where are you actually from? Michigan. Michigan? All right. Well... but do you still have family or friends there? Nah, I ain't got no ties. None that I give a damn about anyway. I mean, I do have a brother. His name's Keith. I hightailed it outta there when I was 12. Shit! Jesus H. Christ. Thank you, dear. Oh, um, Dad, I forgot to mention, I let a friend stay the night last night. Well, hello there. Good mornin'. Morning, Lee. Where did you find that robe? Oh, it was just sittin' in the bathroom. And uh, I couldn't find my clothes when I woke up this morning, so. Yeah, I figured, after last night, you might want to sleep in, so I put them in the wash. I-I'm sorry. Do you mind if I ask you to put on something else? It's just that robe used to belong to my mother and... No, no, no, no. You look perfectly fine in that robe. Jennifer, are you going to introduce me to your friend? Uh, yeah. Sorry, Dad. Um, this is Lee. She's new in town. Um, Lee, this is my father, Lewis Fell. Folks around here call him "Commodore." Oh, Commodore? Man, I love those guys. I'm not that kind of Commodore. I used to run boat tours for filthy rich people with far too much time and money on their hands. Now it's just a hobby with me. Well, I'd say, from the looks of this pad, you didn't do too bad in the filthy rich department yourself. Well, I've made lots of good investments over the years. Well, it's a real pleasure to meet you. Sir. My employees call me Sir. My friends call me Lewis. Yeah. Well, my friends call me Lee. But a... handsome older gentleman like yourself can call me Aileen. You want some coffee, Aileen? - Yeah. - Okay. Oh, Jesus, Dad! Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - You okay? This damn no-wax linoleum's gonna be the death of me. Yeah. Well, you can always have them write on your tombstone, "Here's the spot where Lewis Fell." Well, I'm a happy man that you were here to rescue me, Aileen. And I'm hopin' we're gonna see a lot more of you around here. Yeah, thank you. Ah, it was really nice to meet you, Mr. Fell. I mean, Lewis. "Here's the spot where Lewis Fell." Thank you. For what? For making him laugh. I haven't seen him do that in a long time. Oh, no sweat. He just needs to lighten up, have a little fun. Listen, um, I don't know what your plans are, but some of us are gonna go shopping and maybe grab some drinks after. Hey, no problem. I got your drift. I'll clear out... No, I... I didn't mean it like that. I was wondering if maybe you wanted to come along? Yeah, look, you're... you're cool. And I appreciate you lettin' me crash here and all, but... I don't got any money to spend at the goddamn mall. You don't gotta be so nice to me. I'm nothing like you. Look, I'm just trying to be your friend. I'd really like it if you stuck around for a while and... Well, I think my dad would too. I gotta get my shit. Time to go. I don't know what it was, but suddenly I got this rush of... I guess you could call it "adventure". I mean, when you got nothin', you got nothin' to lose, right? So, I figured... what's the worst that could happen? Let us in, let us in. Stop. My Dad's asleep. Stop it. Good. Let's go skinny-dipping. No, not right now, Mitch. What the... Jen, what's wrong? Oh, shit. Did I feel bad about what I did? Hell if I know. Besides, I'd already gone through more shit in my life than anyone ever deserved. So, it was time I got some payback for once. Well, you know, I'm not always so good with words. But... I can only say what I feel in my heart. Lewis, the second I laid eyes on you, I knew you were the one for me. I love you, Lewis Fell. And, oh yeah, I can also say these two little words. "I do." By the power of God, and the power vested in me by the state of Florida, I pronounce you, Lewis Gratz Fell and Aileen Carol Wuornos, husband and wife. You may now kiss the bride. Of course, they all said the marriage was doomed from the start. But as a wise man once said, "What the hell do they know anyway?" You don't have to move out to the pool house, Jenny. This is still your home. No, it's not, Dad. It's yours and it's hers. Ugh, I should probably find my own place anyway. But I promised Mom I'd look after you, and that's exactly what I'm gonna do. Just from a safe distance. You know I'm always going to love your mother, but she's gone now. Don't I deserve a little happiness in the last years of my life? Yeah, of course you do, Dad. But you didn't have to marry her. I really hope we can be friends again someday, Jen. Ugh, don't bet on it. I love my daughter. I didn't mean to hurt her. Of course, you didn't, baby. You know that blood's not always thicker than water. I'm here for you now. I always will be. Let's go to bed. Double shot of Jack. Neat. Make it two. Rough night? Come on. The least you can do is say somethin' after I bought you a drink. Yeah. Don't recall askin' you to do that. Hell, looks like you should be buying me a drink. In fact, looks like you should be buyin' for the whole house. And it looks like you should fuck off. Hey, why all this hostility, baby? I had a real shitty day, okay? Well, what was so shitty about it? I got married. Christ, woman! You really did have a shitty day. Well, hey. To the freedom we once had. Hurry it up! Hold your horses, woman. Fuckin'-A, that's good. I needed that, man! It's been too goddamn long! Then help yourself, pretty thing. There's plenty to go around. Holy shit! I'm rich! I'm fuckin' rich! Oh, fuck. I feel dizzy. Can I sit down? Yeah, all right. You're all right. - Damn it. - I got you. I got you. What're you doing? Stop. - Oh, no, babe. - No, no, no, no. We're just starting. Come on. No, no. Stop. No! What're you doing, man? I told you I'm married. Yeah, so am I. Stop! Okay, hold on, babe. We're going for a little ride. No, no! Fuck, bitch! Get that bitch off. God! Bitch's crazy! Get the fuck off of me! Step aside, boys. This one's mine. Remember me? Cops are here. Let's go. Yo, fuck this! I'm outta here. I didn't do shit, man! Arrest them, goddammit! They tried to rape me. Fuck! This bitch is crazy. The court orders that the charges of assault and disorderly conduct be dropped and that the defendant be released to the custody of her husband, Mr. Fell. I'm sorry, baby. I'm so damn sorry. I just had one drink. And then I was gonna come right home but this asshole started comin' on to me... I don't want to hear it, Lee. I really and truly don't have the patience right now. Oh, please don't hate me. You know, I... I just... you're the best thing that's ever happened to me in my whole miserable, pathetic life. And I won't do it again. Promise. I wanted to surprise you with this at breakfast this morning. But instead, I got called downtown to bail my wife out of jail. Why the hell did you do this? Because I happen to be proud of the woman that I married, that's why. I never asked you to paint my goddamn name and face all over town. I don't know what's gotten into you, Aileen. I honestly don't. But I don't like it. Hey, look, I'm sorry, okay? I just, like... I just don't feel like I fit in here. You know, I'm just trying to be the best wife I can be to you. I just feel like everyone hates me here. It just takes time, that's all. And no one hates you. Least of all me. Not now, Mitch, please. Here's an idea. Stop sulking and go and talk to him. No! No, I refuse to support this sick sham of a marriage. Not now. Not ever. So, what are you going to do? Live in exile out here in the pool house for the next 20 years? This place wasn't exactly built for intimacy, if you know what I mean. Well, at least from out here, I can keep an eye on things. Without having to be under the same roof. Since I've been playing mediator between the two of you, he invited you to go sailing with us. Grady and Dad are going, and I think you should, too. Me and "The Wicked Stepmother" on an afternoon sail? Sounds delightful. Maybe if she fell overboard. Maybe you're right. What's that old saying? Keep your friends close. Keep your enemies closer? This is the mast. It's connected down here to the boom. Boom-chick-a-boom-boom. You gotta be real careful with the boom. Because if it's not properly secured down here, it'll snap like a twig and uh... Ka-boom? Ka-boom. Just grab on right here. And this... right here. This is called... A steering wheel? No, my darling. In... in nautical parlance, it's referred to as "the helm." - Well, then. - To helm with you. Beautiful day for a sail, Commodore. Welcome aboard. You remember Victor from the wedding? And of course, you know his son, Mitch. Good to see you, again, Aileen. Charmed. Fortunately for me, Victor is a far better CPA than he is a sailor or a golfer. Oh, you will eat those words next weekend at the tournament, I assure you. Hey! Ah, the prodigal son returns. I told you 1 p.m. sharp. - Where the hell have you been? - Sorry, Dad. I was stuck in traffic. That's not all you got stuck in. This indolent underachiever is my youngest son, Grady. It is such a pleasure to finally meet the new Mrs. Fell. Got room for one more? I hope you don't mind if I tag along. I have missed you. I'm so glad you decided to come. It's not the same without my First Mate. Oh, I'm so glad you came. All aboard! I didn't know which one was the lesser of two evils. But one thing was for sure, I was trapped on a voyage of the damned. And if there's one thing that makes me sicker than phony-baloney rich folks talkin' about themselves, it's bein' anywhere near the water. I get it, I get it. Let them win, okay? Let them win. I get it. Yeah, that's why I love it with the game. Long time no see, Lee. It's not just me, Lewis. Everyone's talking. Like I give a shit what everyone thinks. I know this isn't what you want to hear. But as your business advisor, mostly as your friend, I have to ask you, how much do you actually know about this girl? What the hell, man? That one beatin' not enough for you? Hey, settle down. I think we started off on the wrong foot. Why don't we, maybe be a little more friendly with each other? Clean the slate, so to speak. Maybe... have a little party? I don't think so. Now if you don't mind... Actually, I do mind. You got some real balls, I'll give you that much. All I'm asking you is just let me check her out. If she comes up clean, no harm done. If she doesn't, I can make it all go away. Quietly. Come on, bitch! You know you want it! A trash-dyke girl like you really has... Come on, bitch! You know you want it! Now you needle-dicked, mother-fucking, piece of shit, you're gonna turn and go back out of there and tell your daddy it's time to go and never show your face around me again. You dig? Um, Lee, are... are you okay? Can we go home now, baby? Please. What's wrong? You don't feel good? No. No, I don't. Actually, Dad, I was kind of hopin' we could get back too. I have some errands I wanted to run in town. You know, I was thinking that maybe Lee... Aileen, you might want come with me? Okay. All right. Watch your step, Dad. Lee! Hey, Lee, wait up. You didn't have to do that. I can handle myself. Yeah, I know you can. But listen, we gotta start looking out for each other. Especially if you're gonna be a part of this family. Come on. That looks utterly sublime on you. Oh, thank you, Courtney. I love it. It's perfect. Your fiancé will fall head over heels when he sees you in this dress. We're not engaged. Not yet. I love it. Let's wrap it up. Lee, um, you know I wanted to buy this dress. Oh, yeah. So, buy. Maybe we'll get a two-for-one discount. I always dreamed of having my own Christian Dy-er. You mean Christian Dior? How about I go find something that might be a better fit for you? Excuse me? It fits me just fine. Okay. Well, why don't you go change and I'll take this up front... "Take it up to the front?" What? You think I'm gonna steal it? Of course not. I wasn't suggesting anything... Yeah, maybe your mouth wasn't suggesting it, but the look on your face sure as hell was. Okay. Um, you know what? It's okay. I don't need to actually buy anything today. I'm just gonna come back another time. I am so sorry, Courtney. Don't you dare apologize for me. What, you think I'm not good enough to shop here? Because I don't dress right? 'Cause I don't look down my nose at other people like all of you and your goddamn Christian Dee-yore? Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. Oh, yeah. Toss the trash out on the sidewalk. Yeah, y'all think you're all high and mighty, but let me remind you of somethin.' I'm married to a very rich man. And you work in a fucking shop. So, while you're sellin' your 300-dollar dresses to these sunburned old skeletons, why don't you do me a big fat favor and go shove it up your ass! Lee! I am so sorry. I'll be right back, and I will... I'll pay for everything. I promise. I'm sorry. Lee! Lee, stop! What is wrong with you? You took me to this place on purpose. You set me up. I what? I'm trying to help you. Help me? Yeah, you can put on your little innocent act in front of Lewis, but I know what you're up to. Now you're just like all of 'em, just a spoiled, stuck-up little bitch who thinks your shit don't stink. You know what? Fuck you, Lee! Yeah? Well, fuck you too! You and all the rest of 'em. I don't need no one. Goddammit. Lee, ugh. Whatever. Jesus. Aileen! What are you doing? Your father doesn't like anyone snoopin' in his office. Good morning, Miss Fell. Well, check 237 is definitely missing. Well, that's criminal, isn't it? Unfortunately, no. Immoral, maybe, but perfectly legal. How could she cash a check without having the approve...? Aileen came into the office about a week ago. She requested a signature card. She made herself an authorized signer on all his personal accounts. Well then, I want her taken off. Not that simple, Jenny. Why not? I'm his sole beneficiary. My mother made sure to give me power... Not anymore. Aileen had you removed. She what? I'm sorry, Jennifer. But she specifically instructed me not to tell you. You work for my family, Victor. God, for years, we have trusted... It's complicated. As his legal wife, she does have certain rights. And I'm not legally or ethically allowed to even... This woman has no ethics. Believe me. I know. A little side project I've been workin' on. Jesus Christ. Please tell me that you've told my father about this. No, and you can't tell him a thing. Not yet. Not until I'm certain that I have enough evidence. This isn't enough evidence? She's a convicted criminal, for Christ's sake. She hasn't committed a crime against anyone in your family. Not that we know of. I'm calling the police. Let me handle it. I don't want your hands or your father's anywhere near this. Let me clean it up for you. Discreetly. And off the books. This is a duplicate of everything I have on her. I want you to have it. For safekeeping. Any sign of trouble, you know what to do. All right. Lewis is at his weekly yacht club meeting. I don't when he'll be back. No, I didn't come to see Lewis. I came to see you. So how are you adjusting to life here in DeLand? It's taken some gettin' used to, but... I like it just fine. I can imagine it's quite different from your home back in Rochester, Michigan. What the hell are you doin'? You been checkin' up on me? I prefer to call it doing my due diligence on behalf of my clients. Anything in those records you'd care to dispute? Get the fuck out of my house. So you agree, we have a situation? No, you're the one with the situation. Get your ass outta here before I call the cops. Oh, be my guest. The sheriff and I, we play golf every Sunday. Go to hell, man. What the hell is this? Well, it looks like 10,000 dollars in cold hard cash to me. Feel free to count it yourself. You want to give all this money to me? If you leave town. Forget all about Lewis Fell and his daughter. I'll take care of the divorce papers, the annulment. And you walk outta here with this briefcase and disappear... Tonight. You think you can buy me off and run me out of town for a measly 10 grand? Yeah, fuck you! My husband is worth millions and so am I. You? You're worth nothing! You are nothing. You're just a little, little grifting, conniving, low-life whore. Oh, God, oh, God. Holy shit! Dad?! What the fuck did you do to him, you bitch? Fuck! You shot me in the dick, you bitch! I'm gonna kill you! I will kill you! Condescending, male chauvinist motherfuckers. Like father, like son. As far as I'm concerned, they got what they deserved. Pardon me if I seem incredulous, but a good portion of what you told me doesn't add up. Are you claiming that you're responsible for the murders of these other two men? Let's just say that I had to take out the trash that night and make it disappear. No! No! No! You feel it. You have to, uh, make an observation. I'll get blamed if we're late for supper. And I... I thought of that, and I... I don't know what made me think of... What the fuck? Keith? Hello, Lee. What the hell, man? How did you find me? Would you look at you? My big sister livin' a good life. Fancy-schmancy husband. Fancy-schmancy house. You got out, sis. Just like you always said you would. Yeah, I'm doin' okay. What happened to you? Esophageal cancer. All them years of smokin' and chewin' and fornicatin'. Comes a time we all gotta face our day of reckonin' for our sins. I'm givin' my life over to Jesus. I had an awakenin', Aileen. And I want to share what I've learned with you. Because the Lord God is truth. And the truth shall set ye free. I ain't do shit, man. You got it all wrong. Little red dots on the porch... Little red dots all over the driveway. I've seen them, Aileen. I've seen everything. What do you want from me? I don't got nothin' to give you. A dying man don't need much. I just want to do everything you'll get to do after I'm gone. A chance to see a world he never showed us. After everything he stole from us! Okay, so just stop it! Stop! You remember all those nights, huh? What he taught us, what he made us do to ourselves, to each other? You promised you'd never leave me. You said you'd always hold me. You've found paradise! Stop it! Stop it! Just stop it! No! Stop! Stop it! I hate you! I hate you! I hate... When a dog's dyin', we don't let 'em suffer. We show 'em some mercy. And come totally before the throne of God Almighty. Always wondered why it's considered a sin to do the same for people. Have cause in the air, and they have done a pouring from under our commander, the God. Now, I wanna point out that when the preacher switched regions, and when the preacher stopped followin' people, the people that don't... Now, that's exactly what you're seeing in this country. You've had the Bible... All of this is very interesting, Aileen. But our reports say that your brother died in Michigan from his cancer. Not in a Florida motel room from asphyxia, much less a bullet wound to the head. I don't give a shit what your goddamn reports say. I'm tellin' you the way it really went down. Now, they don't want you to know the truth because it wouldn't fit with their agenda. They've gotten in here and infected us, okay? Now, are they in control, or am I? 'Cause I ain't no Calamity Jane, man. I ain't in the business of tellin' tall tales and jazz. Now do you wanna hear the rest of this or not? You don't have much time, Aileen. And if you want to spend it this way, go right ahead. Then buckle up, buttercup. 'Cause this is where it really gets good. Come to find out, I was the one gettin' paid off by Keith, not the other way around. Seems he'd made me the sole beneficiary of some fly-by-night life insurance policy. Ten G's. Not too shabby. I didn't want to kill Keith. But like the others, he had it comin'. You don't jab a rattlesnake with a stick and expect it ain't gonna bite you back. I just had a bit of housekeepin' to take care of, then I'd be home-free. Girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do. Your father was onto something. Something big. Aileen didn't come to DeLand looking to marry a rich older man. She came here looking for someone else. Who? I'd like to close these accounts, please. All of them? I believe I said all of them. How y'all doin' tonight, folks? I saved you the best seat in the house. Weatherman says we're in for a real storm tonight. Rain tears through this little valley like a son-of-a-gun. What can I get your kids started with? You're a lot younger than I expected. What do you mean by that, dear? Your name is Diane. Yeah. Diane Pittman? I, um, believe you have me mistaken for someone else. My last name is Spool. I'll be back when you've had a chance to look at the menus. I know where your daughter is. Your daughter is Aileen. How the hell in the world did you find me? I haven't gone by Pittman in over 20 years. We didn't. My father did. And now, he and my brother are missing. I don't know what I can do for you. I married at 14. Aileen, "Little Lee," as I used to call her, never met her real daddy. He was a very violent man. He was put away for crimes against children. He ended up hangin' himself in his prison cell. I didn't have the means to care for two children. So I thought it would be better if I left them in the care of my parents. Yeah, she told me all about her grandparents. How-how they abused her, violated her. Heck, they put her out on the street when she was just 12 years old. She is a liar, and a very dangerous liar. She does not have a conscience like other people. Like her daddy, she lives in a constant state of paranoid delusion. She manipulates, she controls, she takes whatever she wants. And once she is done with you. She kills. Aileen, it's time we have a talk. About what, baby? About everything. About who you are. And what you've done. You're not thinkin' clear, baby. It was Jennifer. She's been tellin' you more lies about me. She's trying to make it seem like I'm the one... Stop it. Aileen! You stop it right now! I want you to explain this to me. Explain what you've done. The bank called me an hour ago. They told me you took it all. Every last cent. I don't know what you're talking about. You've got it all wrong. Jennifer told me what you were up to. What Victor already figured out. So we went to the bank this morning, and... we moved the money to other accounts. What you stole, it's only a drop in the bucket compared to what I'm really worth. Do you think I'm... just some tired, feeble old fool who doesn't see what's happening under his own roof? Baby, don't you see? Jennifer hates me for comin' into your life. For bein' the woman that took you away from her. No woman will ever take me away from my daughter. I know what you did. Now I know who and what you are. And I'm calling the police. You had your chance with me, Lewis. I gave you my youth, my looks, my body. But everything comes with a price. And now you gotta pay. You get out of my way. Where you goin', baby? I want you out of my home! I want you out of my life! Aw, just when we were having so much fun. That's the spot where Lewis Fell. That gate's not working. Looks like the power's out. We're gonna have to make a run for it. - Okay. - Come on. Dad? Dad, are you home? The storm could have knocked out the power lines. I'll try the fuse box. No. Daddy, no, no, no! Please, Daddy, no, no, no, no! Daddy, please, please! Daddy! Mitch! Mitch, help me. Daddy, please. Oh, my God. Where do you think you're taking my husband? You fucking bitch! What did you do to him? What did I do? I think the question the police are gonna ask is, "What did you do?" No. They'll never believe you. I-I have evidence. Evidence that proves who you really are. Oh, yeah? You mean that little file Victor put together on me? Yeah, I took care of it already. Took care of him... and your rapist pig of a brother too. Fuck you! Here, help me. Help me. We gotta get him up. One, two, three. - Let's go. - Okay, come on. Let's go. Come on. You got it. Watch your step. Be careful. You'll be okay, Lewis. We're gonna get you out of here. All right, come on. Just a little bit farther. Hang on, Dad. Please hang on. - This way. - Get him to the hospital. I'll deal with Aileen. No! I am not leaving here without you. Goddammit, Mitch! Get him outta here! Just go! Now! I can't swim. Take my hand. Lee, here. Reach. I can't. Aileen! I see you, Aileen. It's over. There's no way out! I coulda been like you! You're no better than me just 'cause you were born into money! You know, I coulda been someone too! I have nothin'! I am nothin'! It's over, Aileen. Oh, God, please. You're just as stupid as a man. Aileen! Oh, Dad. Thank God. She's gone now, my dear. Aileen's gone. So... that's how it ended for Mrs. Lewis Fell the Second. She even got a burial at sea, which I thought was kinda cool. In actuality, I washed up somewhere off the St. Johns River. Guess I was lucky the gators didn't find me before some old fisherman did. Keith's life insurance money kept me going for a spell. But it didn't last long. Before I knew it, I was back to my old tricks again. Remember me? It's payback time, bitch. Doctors never could put my teeth back right. Whatever. I like my smile. I think it gives me character. I'm not doubting that you were married to Mr. Fell for a short period of time. But as for the rest of your story... You mean to tell me that after all that, you still don't fuckin' believe me? I don't know, Aileen. Should I? Well, maybe you should just figure it out then, huh? Peter? A raped woman got executed and used for books and movies and shit. Embellish and stretch the truth, 'cause that's what they all do. That's what fuckin' sells! They sabotaged my ass! Time's up here. Society, the cops, the system! Well, fuck you all! Fuck 'em all! A 109 in the dayroom. Back-up needed. I'm sailin' with the rock, and I'll be back, like Independence Day, but with Jesus! Calm the fuck down! I'll be back on June 6th, just like the fuckin' movie! Come on. Big motherfucking ship and all! - Aileen! - Thanks, society... For railroadin' my ass. Back up! Back up! - I'll be back, goddammit. - Where is the... That back-up? I'll be back!
