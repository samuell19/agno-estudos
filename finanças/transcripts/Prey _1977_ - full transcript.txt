Kaytor to command ship. Command ship. I am now in orbit. Proceed with mission. - Switching to portable transmitter. Jo, Jo! - What's the matter? - The lights and the noise. It must've come from the village. - No it came from the sky. - What did? I woke up and the whole room was filled up with this green light and there was this noise like a roar and then the light disappeared. It must've been a dream. I saw it I tell you, I saw it. It came from the sky. Why did you scream? I was having one of my nightmares. I thought that had all stopped now you've moved into your own home. It was horrible. I was dreaming about you and Simon and then this creature started chasing me and I called out to you and Simon. And then I woke up. Simon's always in my nightmares. That's strange. - I guess I miss him coming to see us more than I realized. Perhaps you do. Hey come on that's enough. Oh come on it's alright. No get off me, get off. I think you better take me home. Where are you going? For a pee, do you mind? Who's there? Dirty bastard. Anderson? Anderson? Oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh. Oh, thank god, I thought... What happened, what was it? Muesli? No thanks. - It'll do you more good than that chemical muck you drink. I'm addicted, a muck addict. - You'll regret it when you're older. Do you know it takes five years for caffeine to get out of your system, like tobacco. - I know, one day I'll stop drinking and smoking. Cross my heart. - And when the lady finally got up in the morning she found out just what? Her whole kitchen ceiling had fallen in and her bedroom was literally hanging in the air. Who said it wasn't a crazy world folks? This is your favorite DJ Davy Hagerty with your favorite radio breakfast show on 174. It's the greatest. You know I think of all men I hate Davy What's It the most. I think I'll eat this in the conservatory. - And what about flying saucers? Not exactly a floating bedroom folks, but certainly something that goes bump in the night and that's just what happened nearby only last night. Village folk here are claiming to have seen flashing lights in the sky during the night. You see? Could it be UFOs? Unidentified flying objects, or just a clever hoax? Well experts at Bristol University reckon it's neither. They say that the lights could've been caused by freak local atmospheric conditions which they say are not that unusual, but well who knows? Could the little green men have landed at last? Mangy bird. - Let's just go and check. - Okay why not? You never know. - It's a good day for taking a book out anyway. Of course I know you're right, there won't be anything there. Jo. ' Yes? You're not listening. No. Come on. What's wrong? What could've done that? Fox. - It must've been traveling incredibly fast to catch three at once. A fox. I heard they talk about us. - Who? People in the village. Why? I don't know. They're jealous. Jealous. Seems like a million years ago that my parents went doesn't it? I'm so glad you decided to stay on Jo. You've taught me so many beautiful things. I only want to make you happy. You do. What we have is real Jessica. We must never loose it, never. See you later. You frightened me. Frightened you? - I heard you walking behind those trees over there. It wasn't me. Must've been a squirrel or something. Jo. - Mm-hmm? - I think I'd like to go away for a while. We're going away in July. And in September we'll be in Paris. I don't mean that I mean by myself just for a little while. No Jessica. We can't risk it. - Why? We've been through this before. - Can't you imagine that I might want to be with somebody else sometimes? There can be nobody else. - But Jo we're not the only people in the world. Jessica if you went away and allowed yourself to get screwed up- - I might find somebody who could understand, who could share. No. No I could never let that happen. I don't want to discuss it. Jo you're frightening me. Jo. Jo listen. I don't want to discuss it. Who are you? What are you doing in there? This is private property. Anderson. Anderson, my name is Anderson. I'm a stranger here. This is private property. This house, does it belong to you? Goodbye Mr. Anderson. I'm sure you know the way out. He's hurt Jo. Mr. Anderson! The man's limping. He was obviously just resting in the lodge. Can't we give him some water or something? Alright. - Mr. Anderson would you like a drink? Have you had an accident, can we help? Yes. I can't remember. My leg. - Nevermind, come on back to the house and rest. Besides it's a long time since we had a visitor. I'll go and put the kettle on. - She's a little nervy today, don't worry. Why don't you sit down and rest that leg? What're you looking at? That. It's Wally. Oh yes. He's very old. Do you have many Wallys? No. There's only room for one parrot in that cage. We used to have dogs though and a cat. My father loved dogs, but Jo my friend thinks they're dirty so now there's only Wally. Dogs? Yeah three of them, an Alsatian and two silly sheep dogs called Mop and Duster. Do other people live here? Only the two of us. - Will other people come to live here? What a funny question. No, no I don't think so. - And you, have you always lived here? No I was born in Canada, but my father had to work in England so we came here. Jo comes from the Midlands. - Many people come from the Midlands. Yes, many as London. London? Where do you come from? - What? I asked you where you came from. London. Yeah? I wonder what's keeping Jo. Excuse me a minute. He's weird don't you think? No weirder than most males. I don't mean that. There's something strange about him. - I've barely spoken to the creature. Well you talk to him. Jo, about earlier, I'm sorry okay? Come on. I think Mr. Anderson likes Wally. He's a stinking nuisance. He is not, he's lovely. Sit down Mr. Anderson. Do you take sugar? I suppose so, most men do. Thank you. Are you alright? It's hot. Leave it until it cools then. Where are you going when you leave here Mr. Anderson? You must be going somewhere. Are you going to London? Yes, London. What are these for? What does one keep plants for? I don't know. We keep them 'cause we like them. They're beautiful don't you think? Yes, but I prefer- Wally? Very strange. My father brought the from India or Singapore or somewhere. I think I'll go and get the eggs. - Your tea's getting cold Mr. Anderson. Oh yes. Good. What's your first name? Anders. Anders, Anders Anderson? Yes. Nice and poetic, Anders Anderson. Swedish? I saw this flashing light so this morning we went out to look. What did you find? Three today, not bad eh? - Excuse me, I better go and help her. Why? 'Cause he prefers parrots to plants? That's not very strange, not for a male anyway. No Jo, he's weird. Everything about him is weird, can't you see that? No. - I think he might've escaped from an institution. Oh? Maybe I ought to phone somebody. What's the name of that place, Crayly? - No, you are not to phone, do you understand? But... - Anyway, we're gonna ask him to dinner. Dinner? - I've decided that your friend will stay for dinner. My friend? - Perhaps he might have to stay the night too. Jo that doesn't sound like you. Doesn't it? You said he thought the man was mad. If he stays 'til dinner we'll soon find out won't we? Bye for now. I thought Jessica was here. Well now that you're here you might as well stay for dinner. Thank you. We eat at eight, never later. We interrupt this program with a news bulletin. The police wish to locate the whereabouts of a white Volkswagen, registration number OHM4F and its two occupants. Anyone with any information is requested to contact their local police station. All information will be treated in strict confidence. - Take down this Volkswagen, OHM4F, it's a '67 Volkswagen. You can check it over now. There's nothing here at all. Oh, is this your vehicle sir? Just a minute sir. - Head him off, head him off the other way. Oh hello. You been here long? For a short while. We better go back to the house. Dinner's at eight you know? Come on. What do they call you? - Jessica Anne, but everybody just calls me Jessica. Are you going back to London soon? London? Yes. I'd love to go to London. Please sit here Mr. Anderson. We're vegetarian. If we're to appreciate the real inner beauty of life we cannot allow ourselves to behave like animals. - I'm sure Mr. Anderson understands that Jo. Do you think so? - I'll give you a little bit of this. Everything we eat is home produce. Home produce? That's right. - I think you should know that Jessica and I are lovers. Jo. No, he must know. Ours is a pure love, without the foul animal function of breeding. I understand. - Good. Eat. Are you alright? Anne. Are you okay? I'll try to get you something else to put on. Oh my god. Simon. Jessica where are you? I'm in the bedroom Jo. What're you doing? What're you doing darling? Darling what are you doing? - I was just looking for something for Anderson. - There are no male clothes in the house, Jessica you know that. - I thought I might find something of my father's. - Leave it to me, I'll see what I can find. - It's funny Simon doesn't come and see us anymore. Is it? - I wonder why. - Probably he's tired of hanging around. He was very attractive. For a man I mean. Was he? Maybe it was just his little cap. Do you remember the one he always wore? Funny I've never seen him without it. Don't talk about him. So, he doesn't come around to see us anymore, so what? That sweater. Sweater? - It belonged to someone I used to know. Josephine gave it to me. She must've found it. Anders, have you ever been scared? I mean really really scared. Yes. When? Not long ago. - What happened? You'd never understand. - What would you say if I said I was scared right now? Right this very minute. Well? Do I scare you? No, no, it's not you, it's... We were talking. About music. - Oh, what sort of music do you like Mr. Anderson? - Classical, he like classical music, especially opera don't you Anders? Do you have the facilities to listen to opera at the Crayly? Crawl? - I've got to get something from my room. - She's been acting very strangely today, I don't know why. Yes. Yes. But I think it's your fault. Have you got what you came for? Yes. What was it? Oh, nothing. - You've been quite stupid all day Jessica. I think that man is contaminating this house. He must go. I think I'll make the coco. What's that? Coco, would you like some? I better show you where your room is. I use this room when I want to be alone. Listen I can't explain now but you better keep the door locked. Why? There's no time, just do as I say. Let's go to bed, eh? Kaytor to command ship. Command Ship. - I've made contact with human lifeforms. Their immediate reaction, aggressive. Forced to take terminal action. New identity established. Continue with mission. Success of total operation's essential. Avoid discovery and conflict. I understand. Will continue surveillance. Anders? Anders? Good morning. It's a lovely day. Brought you some tea, it's not hot. That's Barnaby, he's my favorite. Did you sleep well? Oh god. Oh you bloody beast, I'll get you for this! That's Jo! - I was right, it was a fox that killed those rabbits. I'll kill it, I'll kill it. Jessica you go to the left for about 200 yards. Anders you go to the right 200 yards, do you understand? Come back towards me making as much noise as you can. See if you can flush the bastard out. Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey! Oh shit! Shit, I missed, I missed, I missed the bloody thing! It was only 10 yards away and I missed. He's probably in the next county by now. We won't get another chance at him today unless he blunders into one of those traps. I will get you. I know you will. You, what happened to you? You were supposed to be beating. I could've kicked myself it was so close. All I had to do was take my time. I'd give anything to get that animal, anything. Where's he gone? Do you think Anders is gone for good? Does it matter? Only that it was someone new. He seemed very gentle. It was to protect you. He seemed very strange and you had to be protected. That's all that matters to me. You know that don't you? Oh you got it. There is some justice. My way of thanking you. Oh revenge is sweet. I only wish I'd done it myself. We must celebrate. The hunter has been successful. Thank you Anders. Now get rid of it, the smell's making me sick. Jo can we have a party? We could dress up and we could have champagne. And I'll make a cake especially for you. Alright. What should we wear? - Something really nice and I'll put my hair up. But what can Anders wear? I know exactly what he can wear. He'll be lovely. How does it look? Great. He'll look very pretty. I feel silly doing this. But it's for you. Isn't she lovely? - She's got a better figure than you too. Thank you. And now the champagne. on. All for one and one for all. We're all alike now. To the hunter. The fox. Yes to the fox. If it wasn't for the fox we wouldn't have anything to celebrate. - Which trap did you find it in Anders? I gave you the fox. Watch it. It's alright. There's plenty for everyone. Just so long as we have a good time. I'll put on some music. - Yes, you prefer classical don't you Anders? What would you like? Classical, whatever Jessica likes. Just happy music, fast music. Do you dance Anders? # Last night she came to me # She came again # So very softly # And then she laid by my side # She swore to me she did say # It is so much we long love # 'Til our wedding day # And then she moved to the ground # She was so glorious # And then she moved to the ground # And then she was gone # And then she was gone # And then she was gone The cake, I better go get the cake. Now you two should dance together. # Accept the way of a stranger # Move through the world that shadows leave behind # But be aware for the danger # You lose pathways or your mind # Accept the hand of a stranger # Could be a lover, a broken heart to mend # Away from the fault you remember # That you were meant to pretend # Perhaps he'll tame you or rearrange you # Or buy and sell you, then you'll say goodbye # You drift on like a fading song # Knowing it's no good to cry # Accept the arms of a stranger # You'll lie there breathless # As constant as the moon # For you're aware Look, do you like it? I thought the fox was a nice touch. A memorial to something that tried to harm us. Now we can eat it. Anders would you like to make the first cut? It's my cake. You made it for me or have you forgotten? No. 'Course it's your cake, but he's the guest. Don't be upset Jo. I'm sorry, it's just that my mother always offered the first cut to the guest. There. You brought the fox, you must have the piece with it on. # Rearrange you, buy and sell you, then you say goodbye # Drift on like a fading song Excuse me. # Accept the arms of a stranger # You lie there breathless as constant as the moon It's a lovely cake. # For you're aware of the sound of I'm sorry I was angry before. I love you so much. I didn't want to share you with someone else. Jo do you realize we haven't seen Anders eat anything since yesterday? Who cares? Let him starve if he wants to. Let's play a game. - What do you think he'll be able to play? Hopscotch would challenge him. Drafts are probably all they let him get up to at Crayly. - Stop it Jo, he's only trying to help. He brought the fox back for you, not for himself. Alright, then what should we play? Hide and seek. This house is so big it's perfect for it. With any luck he'll get lost. - We're gonna play a game, hide and seek. What's a game? What you play silly. Hide and seek is like hunting. One of us is the hunter, he counts up to 50, then the others run and hide and he has to find them. I understand. I'll be the hunter, I'd like that. To the chase. May the best man or woman win. Come on. 47, 48, 49, 50. This way it's easy for the hunter. We'll be caught. Like you. - What do you mean, we've never played this game before. You're like a caged animal. No Anders it's not like that. I can do what I want and I can go where I want. I prefer to stay with Jo because she protected me and she likes me. - That was easy, no imagination at all. - It was just a practice run so Anders would understand. Now it's your turn to be the hunter. Count to 50 and we'll hide. One. Two. - Let's go separately, that'll make it difficult for him. You stay up here and I'll go downstairs. Good idea. You frightened me. I don't know why but I suddenly got paranoid you were gonna hurt me. It's silly, silly. How'd you find me so quickly? Your smell. I smell? We must look for Josephine. I thought it was him. Did he find you? Yes and he'll find you too. He smells us. That's what he told me. He said he smelled me. What's that for? He is dangerous. I think he's mad. I went outside through the kitchen and I found the fox or what was left of it. - You're making that up, he couldn't. - Only the skin was left, all the flesh was gone. You're trying to frighten me. Show it to me. It's outside. I couldn't touch it. I want to see it. You always told me terrible things about Simon you couldn't prove either. I only did it to protect you. He is insane. It's only a game. He is an animal. You must believe me. Come outside and I'll prove it to you. He's hidden it. I was outside. Believe me Jessica, the bastard's bloody mad! Let me help. - I didn't intend to frighten Josephine. I was just playing the game. She's very upset. I guess the party's over. How very sweet you both look. What a very attractive couple you make. Ask him why he never eats Jessica or are you afraid he'll tell you? Rabbits, chickens, the fox, and the fox wasn't caught in a trap, he caught it with his bare hands. Let him caress you with those hands. Oh stop it! It's late, I want to take a bath. We should all go to bed. - I think I better leave in the morning. Yes. Oh you bitch, you frightened me. I thought you were in the bath. That's Why I did it. Things aren't always as they seem. No, they're really not. Kaytor to command ship Command ship. Proceeding as planned. I've made preliminary tests, unsatisfactory. Will continue until alternative supply located. Jo? Jo? Jo where are you? What were you doing outside? Just walking. Want some tea? Is Anderson still here? Yes Why? - It's just that people always seem to leave before I get out of bed. You get up late. - Even Simon, the one time he stayed here he was up and out at the crack of dawn. You know why? He couldn't get out of here quick enough when he found out about us. But Simon was a friend. Funny how he didn't even wait to say goodbye. What do you mean by- What was that? - Maybe he can't swim. - Swim to the shore. Help! Hold on, I've got you. Come on, let's go, let's go. Let's get him out. Jessica. Oh okay. Let's go. He's drowned. Oh no he's not, it's just shock. Come on get him to his feet. Come on. Why go into the water if you can't swim? Swim? Come on get up. Would you like some brandy? - What were you doing in the water anyway? Just walking. - Walking? Walking on the water? Water? Go and get a towel. Come on, let's get you dry. Get changed in here, it's warmer. Walking on the bloody water. Here. I'm gonna take a bath are you coming? Yeah. Good morning Wally. - As soon as his clothes are dry he must go do you hear? Maybe I should go with him. Are you mad? He's not well Jo. - You are staying here, you are not leaving. - I want to, you can't just keep me here. Can't I Jessica? Just try me. This is becoming a nightmare. Don't try it! - I'm not trying anything, I want to leave this house and I'm leaving with Anderson! What do you think you're doing, keeping me prisoner here? This is my house remember? Shit. - You said you were going to London, I'm coming with you. I've had enough, I can't stand anymore! I'm leaving! Jessica. - No. It just doesn't work! You're going to far this time. I'm leaving you bitch. Jessica! - I'm leaving. Don't leave me! Afox has got Wally! Stop it will you? Stop it you stupid. Will you, come here. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Stop it. So this is your beautiful love? Carry her upstairs. Here. Take this. - Why? Take it, you'll need it. I know what it's like to be fleeing from one of those places. Crayly's not the best. Now get out of here. Don't come back. You silly little bitch. You'll never leave me now. Where's Josephine? She's gone out. You've got to help me. " How? Come along, I'll show you. See? See this knife, she killed Simon with it. I saw you in the night. - Don't you understand, she killed him. You were together. Listen to me, she killed him! You belong to Josephine. I belong to whom I choose. If I belong to you would you take me away from here? You bitch. Bitch, you filthy little bitch. I loved you. I cared for you. Silly little bitch! What's wrong? - Join the others you filthy little bitch. Kaytor calling command ship. Send advance parties immediately. Have now established humans high in protein and easy prey.
