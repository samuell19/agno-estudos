Inmate Zineb Agha to the departure office, please. I hope your prison stay went well. OK, here are your jewels, here's your bag. Check them. Nice bag. I think that's her. Yeah, it's her. Your sister's over there. Mina! How are you? -Shéhérazade. -No more Shéhérazade. -I'm going by my real name. -So you won't kiss me? Meet my children. One-year-old twins. Beautiful, huh? In three years, you could've visited at least once. I can't stay long. What's the disguise for? -You on a grift? -Stop it! I'm married now, I'm doing really well. I've got a good husband, a nice place, beautiful kids. Hamdoullah! Everything's great! "Everything's great"... Doesn't look that way. Here, the keys to your apartment. Don't know if you want your sister back, but as you can see, she likes playing grandma. Wanna come home with me? Like old times! I've paid my debt to society! PALOMA DELIGHT Oh my soul, I still love him! Could you lower the music? Of course, ma'am. Different music, maybe? No, thanks. You know, the Paloma in the song... She existed, it's a true story. No kidding? Of course she existed! It all started with the Alhambra Theater case. Shéhérazade was handling the case. Yes, that was her dressed in nun's garb at the prison gates. -'Morning. -'Morning. -I'm here for the audition. -What audition? The dance audition. Who said there was an audition? Weren't you informed? No matter, you can audition. What would you have me audition for? -Whatever you like. -You're cute! -Hey, you're late! -My heel broke. Come quick, it's this way. Go on, go on! Don't mind me! -What? -Think I'm blind? I just told her where the audition took place. Careful! You know I love only you! You sure? Long live youth! Mrs. Bellil wanted to divorce her husband but keep her theater. And the cashier, of course! You're a professional dancer? I know the Algiers, the Kabyle, the Setifian, the Chaoui... This theater shows only Egyptian movies. You dance to Egyptian music. Can you belly dance? My name isn't Shéhérazade for nothing! Let's give it a try. She's great! Thanks, miss, but it won't work out. Why, honey? She dances really well! -And she's beautiful too. -It's not what I'm looking for. What're you looking for? You've seen a dozen girls and you always turn them down! It's not what I'm looking for. -I'm hiring her! -I said no. Think you'll fill the theater with a dance number? No means no! What's his problem? Tell Mrs. Aldjéria I wanna see her. Think she'll be much longer? No, I don't think so. -Mrs. Bellil. -Yes? -Sure you won't have a seat? -No, thanks. They were born this morning. Are you her son? Sorry, I didn't introduce myself. I'm Riyad. Mrs. Aldjéria only son. Sure you won't have a seat? Yes. I was on another case: the Fleur Du Jour restaurant. 10:15 sharp. No, I have no doubt whatsoever. Good-bye. They'll show up on Monday the 7th, at 10:15. -It's really gonna happen? -Of course. -You'll be the king of sorbets. -Thank you! As agreed, 50% in advance. 25%. -"25%"? -How do I know it'll work? Shéhérazade, 25%. And the rest on the 7th. Please. Will you be there, Mrs. Aldjéria? Of course I will! And no funny business, or your fast-food goes down! And you along with it! And that's a promise. Get it? Mrs. Aldjéria... We're canceling everything! I think he suspects something. -Let's go into my office. -They're born, Ma! See this man out, please. Gimme back my money, I'll figure something out. -It was just a first meeting. -I said I want my money back! Let's discuss this calmly. There's the woman who can't even belly dance! -Your husband's a wet noodle! -What's she insinuating? Enough, Shéhéra! Mrs. Bellil, please... This type of operation wasn't new to Shéhérazade: seducing a man, meeting him at a hotel in order to be caught in the act of adultery. I'd met Shéhérazade in 1995, in the little square near Nelson Market. In 1995, at the height of terrorism, I had to be discreet. Life for a woman like me was always at risk. It's 10,000 dinars. To make ends meet, I sold 14-karat gold from Turkey. Get your hands off! That's when I heard... Get your hands off! I'll get even some day! You're not a man! Beat it! Your wife can blow you! After things calmed down, I went to see her. Looking for trouble? No, looking for you. May I? I won't offer you bread, it's disgusting. My name's Aldjéria. People call me Shéhérazade, but my name's Zouina. Men like it. Makes them dream. What's your real name? Everybody likes "Aldjéria" too: men, women, dogs, cats... But my real name's Agha Zineb. I prefer Aldjéria. -Do you like "Shéhérazade"? -Yes, a lot. It's true that Shéhérazade made men dream. But Mr. Bellil was hard to please. -Water? -No, thanks. Mrs. Bellil, never lose hope. I promise you'll soon be free as a bird. I'd like to know how! Mrs. Aldjéria, these auditions won't last forever! He'll find a girl eventually. -Know what I have here? -I don't care, I want my money! Bombs. Atomic bombs. Even worse, nuclear bombs! To make Iranians swoon. I'll show you pictures of gorgeous girls. Which of these beauties would your husband fall for? Mina's calling for you. Choose a girl and we'll contact her immediately. Right, Shéhéra? Keep an eye on Shéhérazade, but don't overdo it. OK, I'm coming! You're just on time, Djaffar. -What's going on? -No tie? Want me to put it on? Of course! She's nuts. She wants her money back. -What? -She's right, put on your robe. -Not the robe! -Yes, it's impressive. Want me to help you choose? I know all the girls. Yes, please. -I recommend Baya. -"Baya"? -What're you doing, Riyad? -What? She's stunning! He's right, she's stunning. -Up for anything? -Yep! Tell her she's screwed without me. Counselor Djaffar is a longtime associate of my agency: "Aldjéria Makes it Happen." A lawyer is practical when you want to fiddle with the law. -I told you stay at the office! -Everything's fine. I rushed over to tell you, as will every lawyer in Algiers: You can't come out unscathed with our present Code. You're stuck. The only solution... ...is Mrs. Aldjéria. I know it's illegal. But at least it's effective. I've seen women end up on the street without a centime. And not just anyone: university professors, doctors... -Even a lawyer! -But that theater's mine! -I inherited it from my dad. -You don't have kids, right? He's the one who's infertile! He won't have the Alhambra! That all depends on you. Mrs. Bellil, the Family Code is hard on us women. -Have you picked a girl? -Yes. Baya. Good choice. A hard worker. Who cares? Just get rid of my husband! Don't worry, we'll take care of him. Baya... The exact opposite of what I'd said. Lazy, and a petty thief. I'd fired her, even though she'd brought in lots of money. Shéhérazade had forgotten to remove her photo. That's a lie, I never stole a centime! "A lie"? Customers are always right and whores are always wrong. That's how it is. Thanks for calling me a whore! OK... I'm sorry. Why didn't you stay for breakfast? Maybe he'd have felt like seconds. You would've earned more, and honestly. I hate it in the morning! "Hate it in the morning"? You're fired. Bitch! Plus she was helping Riyad get a visa to go find his dad in Italy. I wasn't that worried. Without his military service, he couldn't leave the country. You OK? I'll explain later. What'd I miss? No military card, he can't leave Algeria. -What're the options? -The boat. No way, I don't wanna end up with just anyone. I'm an honest smuggler, Baya. I'm not talking any old African tub. I'm talking luxury cruise as far as Melilla. -Sounds good. -Then what? Long live Europe! It's Schengen. Spain for you, Italy for him. Can't you get him a military card? That's a one-way ticket to prison now. Well, what'll it be? We'll think about it. Better think fast, I've got people waiting! -I know! -OK, fine. -Having second thoughts? -Your mom fired me. What? Why? -Why'd she fire you? -Bad timing, I need money. -Tell me why she fired you! -Don't count on me anymore. You can't bail out on me! With or without your mom's money, I'm going to Spain. -I'll talk to her. -Right... -That ship's sailed... -Don't worry, I'll talk to her. -I didn't do it on purpose! -No? Is it my fault her photo was in there? "I recommend Baya. She's stunning." Don't think I don't know what you're scheming with that hussy! -Thanks a lot! -You're welcome. -He wants to find his dad. -Aldjéria... I'll talk to him. -Now call Baya. -Never. You know I can't abide by thieves, Djaffar. Beautiful girls are a dime a dozen in Algiers. Monday, July 7, at the Fleur Du Jour. 'Morning! Rachida, that lady's waiting! Take her order. Yes, ma'am. -Ready to order? -What's your specialty? -Paloma Delight. -What's that? Jasmine sorbet, served with crushed almonds and rose petals. -Is it homemade? -Of course. Everything here is homemade with natural products. They don't seem very laid-back. You'll have to resew that button. Paloma Delight? -Yes, Paloma Delight. -Paloma Delight! Don't drag your feet. I was a bit anxious. I was afraid the operation would fail. Yet it was only 10:00. Public Health Services were due at 10:15. -A homemade Paloma Delight. -Thanks. -Rachida! -Yes, ma'am. While savoring the sorbet, I realized the waitress would be just the thing for Mr. Bellil. -Liked it? -Very much. -Like working here? -It's OK. What a waste! -Too pretty to be a waitress... -What do you see me doing? I don't know, but not waitressing. -Model? -You'd like to model? -No. -Oh, yes! -Rachida, please! -Yes. In case you want to model... ALDJÉRIA MAKES IT HAPPEN Keep the change. Of course Public Health didn't show up at 10:15. Still, they got there at 11. 'Morning! I'd like to see the owner, please. -That's me. -We're with Public Health. -What? -Public Health. -Whaddaya want? -We've had complaints. -Know where you are? -The Fleur Du Jour. We know your reputation, but there've been complaints. -From who? -What kind? Patrons who ate here and who got sick. A few cases of diarrhea. "Cases of diarrhea"? Who is it? -Me, who else? -I hadn't recognized you. -How long will it take? -For what? Before they close the Fleur Du Jour. -A month. -That's too long! With this heat, in a month, if you don't steal all their customers, it means your ice cream is shit. Too bad, it is shit. That's what I did: giving that little push to businesses... -My husband's cheating. -...to couples... Got a picture? ...to divorce proceedings. Sometimes people don't know how to get things done. -I'm listening. -I own a plot of land. But I couldn't get a building permit. I even paid a chipa, but to no avail. -Where's the land? -In Ben-Aknoun. Could you show me on the map? Of course. And we sold a bit of love, to ease the loneliness of certain men. In fact, I'd become a national benefactress. Could I have a smoke? Of course. Thanks. Been working under the table long? A little over two years. -Does it pay well? -Yes, it's got its advantages. No taxes and stuff like that. As for me, I wasn't struggling for a plot of land or a theater. Even less to sell ice cream. I was striving to realize my dream: Aldjéria's Thermal Baths, in my hometown of Fouka. It's back to my roots, kids! We're in Fouka. Fouka! It's 10 km past Fouka. -She says we're not in Fouka. -Of course we are! She can't possibly remember. Back then, it was a little village of Sicilian fishermen. -Ah... Now I understand! -"Understand" what? Why we've become mafiosi, Mamma! I don't understand. I could swear I saw a Caracalla Thermal Baths sign. How silly of me! That was before the barbarian invasions. Mina says it's lower down. I'll call Counselor Djaffar. He'll know for sure. Maybe Mina's right. The line's busy. When was the last time you came here? Ages ago. Since my dad's death in 1965. He wanted to be buried in Fouka. It's also the year Mom stopped working at the baths. Never since then? Yes, once with Riyad. Remember that? -You must've been five. -Yes, I remember. Shall we visit Granddad's grave? Not today, we don't have time. For me, the Caracalla Baths were vital. I absolutely wanted a new life. A new life for Riyad, for Shéhérazade... For all of us. Yes, that's what I did! But I can't find the sign. Yes. I turned left, then drove up. I passed the gendarmerie. Hey, hurry! -We found it. -I think they found it. OK, talk to you later. Not finding our way was a bad omen. -But I didn't take heed. -You got lost? I was too happy to go back to the baths of my childhood. Yes, but I'm so happy! To rekindle with the smells... This is a great idea. It'll be wonderful! The sea, the baths... Mom and I always went in through those doors. It was the staff entrance. Can you hear the goldfinches? Caracalla! I always wanted to kiss him, but I was too little. Yes, I remember! Mina tried giving me a leg up, but it never worked. You're all grown up now. -You can kiss him. -Try to stop me! The Caracalla Thermal Baths were nationalized during Boumediene's presidency. Closed for over a decade, they were going to be privatized. This is the frigidarium level, Caracalla's most beautiful room. The "Frigidaire"? No, frigidarium is Latin for "cold room." -You remember it? -Of course, Mr. Merad. I spent my childhood here. And here's the famous frigidarium. I could buy the baths for next to nothing. "Frigidarium," the cold room. I was quite willing to pay the chipa, or bribe. We'd slide here, remember? Yes! Carlotta. Carlotta was our friend. You remember! You got to see the greats of the world in their birthday suits! Mr. Merad...! -Even the Pope. -No, not the Pope. -John Paul II came here? -Shéhérazade! John XXIII! -Shéhérazade, John XXIII. -Yeah... I remember John XXIII's stay. Mom wasn't working. Arabs'd been given the day off, for fear we'd cut his throat. The French have never understood us! In my day, it was Fidel Castro, Arafat, Amin Dada. Mind you, the Queen of England almost came. -But she didn't! -Shéhérazade! You were told the establishment was listed? -Yes, I told her. -He did. You can't tear it down to build... ...a bazaar, for example. I don't intend to, Mr. Merad. Mr. Merad was to vouch for me before the president of the Commission for the Privatization of Tourist Resources. He who drinks this water is freed from worldly constraints. My freedom, however, depended on a celebratory drink. In this country, everyone is thirsty. Starting with him. Don't worry, water cures will always be popular. The myth of eternal youth! I was thinking about something else. Am I allowed to change the name of the baths? What would you call them? Aldjéria's Thermal Baths. Why not? My childhood dream would finally come true. Despite my savings, I still needed more money. Not quite, but almost. -Know who's getting married? -No... It must be nearby. -Four. -Is it enough? Can't you see you're bothering me? -Give that back! -He'll never notice. From which wad? That one? It's OK, then. One, two, three, four, five... Get out! You made a wish at the baths, by the fountain. I did nothing of the sort. -I saw your lips move. -Yeah, so? What was your wish? I can't tell anyone, or it won't come true. -But you can tell me. -I told you to get out! -Go on... -What're you doing there? Turn that off, please! My word, you're rutting! Don't talk to me like that. If you don't like it, then stay in your own bed. -I'll do what I want. -Please, Riyad... Out! -I just finished counting. -And? We should be OK. Two or three more jobs, and it'll be over. Good night. -Want me to close the window? -No, that's OK. Good night. I knew full well what was going through her mind: leaving me to get married and have kids. Yet I'd promised she'd run the beauty salon at the baths... So I can't joke around with my son anymore? Seems like fun! She made a wish. She made what? Shéhérazade made a wish. You didn't notice, when we drank from the thermal waters? No, I didn't. So? She wants a new life. We all want a new life. Really? You want a new life too? Of course. I'm tired of solving other people's problems. Thank God! The thermal baths'll be the start of something new. What'll you do, at the baths? I know what you're thinking, but I'm running the till! I'm going to Italy. Don't start that again! Start what? Isn't it normal that I wanna find my dad? If I knew where he was, I would've told you! -You don't have a photo? -I didn't own a camera then. It's not funny, Ma. Maybe you don't know who my dad is! Whaddaya take me for? Of course I know! You must've been drunk. -Now that hurts. -I'm the one who's hurting! I know it's not easy for you. But what can I do? What's done is done. Want me to shoot myself? Think it's easy for me to be an unmarried woman? But that's what gives me strength! -I don't even have a name. -Don't like your mom's name? You don't like "Riyad Agha"? No, you'd prefer an Italian name like Spaghetitto! "Agha" is a nice name. The descendant of a Janissary. Who were the Janissaries? They were bastards. Never stopped them from being at the head of an empire. Sweetie, nothing's stopping you from realizing your dreams. Stop wallowing in self-pity. If it's any consolation, your dad was a good man, the only man I've ever loved. Right... Next you'll say you made a vow of chastity ever since. Now that's my son! Of course I've made a vow of chastity. Have you ever caught me with another man? Besides you? I don't want you to leave me. I don't want you to. Come on, let's dance. True, I know nothing about his dad. Except that he was an Italian volunteer I met at the beach. So? Is that a problem? Tell the man who left me The man who forgot me That I still want him back I hoped that seeing me run the Caracalla Baths, he'd be more than happy to give up his plan. The Bellil case was still pending. Thanks for the pastries. I was staking out the Fleur Du Jour, waiting till she came out. I wanted some pretty girls for the baths as well. Don't get the wrong idea! The Aldjéria Baths would be a respectable establishment. I was afraid Shéhérazade would ditch me. I needed a new partner. And one Paloma Delight! I'd never have recognized you! I had to be incognito for a job. So what happened? -Nothing, the place is closed. -For good? -Till they inspect the place. -You sure about that? That's what they told me. Sorry, but I gotta run. -What's your hurry? -My bus... -Why? Where do you live? -Tipaza. You mean you commute every day? No, I sleep at the restaurant. 'Bye, gotta run! -Wait! Can't we chat a while? -I'll miss my bus. I win! Your turn. -What're you doing here? -Hi, Rachida! Public Health closed down the restaurant. -"Public" what? -Yeah, pastries! Thanks. -No more work. -Explain that to your dad. -You got married? -No, she screwed up! Whose is it? -Whose is it? -I wasn't there! It didn't take long before she called asking for work. -Your sisters? -Yes. They're pretty. -What kind of work, exactly? -A bit of everything. We handle weddings, divorces. We tail people, carry out investigations. -I've never done that! -You'd rather be a model. -No. -I can see it in your eyes! No. What's your dream, then? You must have a passion, we all do! It's dance. -So you like dancing? -I love it. -How old are you? -21. "21"... Your family doesn't worry about your wanderings? I raised myself, I do as I please. Fantastic! -We're neighbors, you know? -You're from Tipaza? Almost neighbors. I was born in Fouka. -No kidding? -Yes. I know it well. Since the end of terrorism, I often go swim there. You live there? No, but we're soon moving back. I'm working on something big! I prefer this area, Algiers is too chaotic. True, but Algiers is where the money is. Here. I'm giving you an advance. Take it, you need it. Don't give it all to them, OK? -You'll come when I give birth? -I don't know. -How many floors? -17. Wait till you see the balcony! It overlooks all of Algiers. -The elevator's out of order. -We're walking up? Indeed. I see Shéhérazade is taking a bath. -Who's she? -You'll soon meet her. It's hot! Riyad, could you bring me some cold water, please? Listening to cooking shows now? -Yes. -Wanna settle down? Stop, not my hair! -How's that? -Great! 17 floors! -Wait, wait! -How old do you think I am? -This is too much! -42. Wrong! -This is too much! -55. -What's her problem now? -She won't see reason! What's the matter now? -What's going on? -The water's leaking. -A lot? -Yes, a lot. -So? -You're going too far. -How so? -You're going too far. -We're doing it on purpose? -Yes, you are! -Go back to your man, you tart! -Calling me a tart? Aren't you ashamed? I've had it! This is my home. There you are! My sister Mina. Hi. She's a deaf-mute, but she's still a chatterbox! That's Rachida. She's going to work with us. -What's she saying? -That you're beautiful. Thanks. Enough about that! Here, put this away. Come, let me show you around. -Seems big. -It is big! The living room. It's also my son's room. He's interested only in birds. Soon he'll grow feathers! My parents. Mina, who you just met. Shéhérazade, my partner. And my son Riyad, the one who loves birds. -What a handsome boy! -He loves only birds. -Want to surprise them? -"Surprise" who? Riyad and Shéhérazade. -Wanna dance for them? -No. Yes, you said you wanted to dance. And we'll have to find you a pretty name. Why? I like my name just fine. A name that makes people dream. If you think my real name's Aldjéria... What'll you name me, then? Paloma. -"Paloma"? -Yeah. But I'm not a sorbet! You're a jasmine sorbet. You're the petals of a rose. You are... ...crushed almonds. You're the flower of the day! Shall we go? -Let's go! -Let's go. You have to turn off the tap, kids. I just ran into the tart, she's furious! Where's my CD? -What're you looking for? -Nothing. What's going on? Bravo! What do you think, Shéhérazade? -Where'd you find her? -At the Fleur Du Jour. Shéhérazade! What's gotten into you? Hi. Hi. You OK? Yeah. I've never seen Algiers from this vantage point. I'm from Tipaza. You can see Tipaza from here. Liar! Those your birds? Yeah. -You like birds? -Yeah. We need a girl like her, no? I never said we didn't. But now I have to start looking out for myself. I feel old and tired. How should I respond to that? With the thermal baths, we'll put all this behind us. -You can run the beauty salon. -I don't know. Whaddaya mean? Who do you think I'm doing this for? For you, Riyad, Mina, and me! Does she know what the job entails? There's my Shéhérazade! -They're ugly! -No, they're not! They'll be beautiful later. They'll look...like this one. It's a mule. A canary mother and goldfinch father. We have to go slowly with her. Know what I think? I don't think she's been deflowered yet. I have a nose for that sort of thing. I have to dance? Perfect, huh? Since you like dancing so much. Thanks, Mina. I just love fresh watermelon! Can I take a gander? Give it back! You're lucky, I thought he was older. Shéhéra, you've met him. He really look like this? Will you shut up? -Let him have his fun. -Your type? Mrs. Aldjéria, what exactly am I supposed to do? It's simple, you'll go to a dance audition. Don't worry, Shéhérazade will explain everything. Right? You'll help her. Yeah, Shéhérazade'll train you. She's got tons of experience. -Very funny! -It's true. Even old geezers go hard for you! -Shut up! -Just tell the truth. -You run an escort service? -Why do you ask? 'Cause I know plenty of girls who make a living that way. It's simple. When someone is lonely, but from a good family, we provide company for him. I'm not that type of girl! -Let me explain... -No need. Seduce him, not sleep with him! Wanna act all virtuous now? I'll put you on dry bread. You'll see how acting all virtuous pays off. So you'd better get her back. Now! Leave me alone. And get my smokes! Now! Open this door. -Want your bag? -Yes. I'll go get it. What's the job, exactly? Setting up the old man so his wife can divorce him. He won't lay a finger on you. What's your name? -Paloma. -"Paloma"... Pretty name. -Are you Spanish? -No, I'm from Tipaza. Paloma is my stage name. Are you dancing elsewhere? No, I wouldn't dare. Dance has such a bad reputation. People always think dancers have loose morals. Then why are you auditioning? I told myself dancing in a theater would be different. It's a theater! Where'd you learn? I'm self-taught. By watching Egyptian and Lebanese TV... Fifi Abdu, Samia Gamal, Tahia Carioca... Want to try on an outfit? What're you doing here? Run along, he might see you! It's safer if you wait for her outside. Know what? It's in the bag! Mr. Bellil had finally taken the bait. That very night, we introduced Paloma to her new life. It's packed tonight! 'Evening, Mrs. Aldjéria! How are you? -Fine, thanks. -Nice seeing you again. The latest recruit! Not bad... Baya! Still slogging away? I do my best, Mrs. Aldjéria. If you need my services, your favorite's available. I'll think about it! Riyad, I need to talk to you. -Later! -Thanks. -A quiet spot, please. -OK, follow me. -I want nothing to do with her! -I know. -From a patron... -Oh? Which one? That man over there. -You know them? -Yes, they're friends. -Have a good evening. -Thanks. Thought we were taking a break tonight... -So they're not friends. -Yes, they are. The Miami! I often came here with Shéhérazade. To relax and have fun. It had a friendly atmosphere. Few fights, and you met great people there. I'd be curious to know what the Miami's like, three years later. -What's going on? -Open up! Mrs. Agha... You OK? I've got the keys. I'll go fetch them. Is Aldjéria back? Yes, but this isn't the time... I had to install padlocks. They wanted to move in... I had to call the cops. Thanks. It's nothing, just doing my job. Alas, not in time to stop them from wrecking the place... Riyad, stop putting holes everywhere! That's enough posters already. Mamma! Ti amo, bella. He's incorrigible! Today, Thursday, June 15, 2006, the MCA soccer team just beat the USMA team to win the Algeria Cup. Before telling you the rest of my story, I'll have a beer at the Miami. -Mrs. Aldjéria... -Still working here? -How are you? -If I'm here, I must be OK. This next song is dedicated to Mrs. Aldjéria. And the requested song is, I Think of You, Paloma. Not dancing to your own song? How old are you? Why do you ask? I'm old enough. Thanks, that's sweet. You remind me of my son. -Oh? -Another beer? Yes, please. Thanks. Long live youth! The Miami's changed a lot in three years. It was altogether different then. Long live everybody! First bid! That's Cheb Rafik, the MC at the time. He'd launched the single I Think of You, Paloma. For 500,000. Amine dedicates this song to all his friends here, to his lovely girlfriend, his very heart and soul! And to Mrs. Aldjéria. I loved it! The dedications, the bids... 500,000, one million, two million... Party! Nobody works for me Nobody fills my cart Your dirty gossip! Only losers think like that Nobody works for me Nobody fills my cart You dirty gossip! Only vultures think like that Hasta la vista, friend! Ciao! One million! From the bald-headed man! Yes. He wants to say hi to Baya, his life, his all. Against Mrs. Aldjéria's table. I'm not to blame... Poor Baya, daring to steal johns from us! What a frenzy! Here I am! Stop everything! One million! More. Two! Yes! Three! Three million! Three million! Now Mrs. Aldjéria has the floor. On behalf of Paloma... Yes, on behalf of... Where is this Paloma? Long live Paloma! On behalf of Paloma from Tipaza... Against Baya, till the morning. Condolences, Baya! You're dead! You're banned till dawn! Stand up, sweetie, don't be shy. Give it up for this superb example of womanhood! I dedicate this song to you. I Think of You, Paloma. I think of you I think of you We sure had fun at the Miami. Are you going to join us at the Sheraton? Right behind you, Shéhérazade! Be right there! -I'll drive. -You're drunk, Ma! I'm not drunk, I'm just happy. Happy to have spent such a nice evening with you. We're going home. No, to the Sheraton for drinks with Mr. Zhang! There'll be no Mr. Zhang or Sheraton! We can't leave Shéhérazade alone. Your job is to protect us! It's to take you home when you're drunk! Fine, then. I'll go to the Sheraton by myself. Come back, Ma! Why don't you want to go? Whaddaya think Shéhérazade is going to the Sheraton for? Mrs. Aldjéria! He's ruined our evening, exactly like he wanted. Paloma, we'll take a cab and go to the Sheraton just the two of us, OK? I'm tired, I wanna go home too. I see... -So we can go home now? -You've ruined her evening! You're the one who ruins everything, not me. I know what you're brooding over. What am I "brooding over"? Want me to have a guilty conscience? Well, no, my conscience is perfectly clear. Drop the act, Ma! Don't think I dislike Shéhérazade! I adore Shéhérazade! I'm very fond of her. After all, I'm the one who took her off the streets. So she could turn tricks in hotel rooms. See? He talks about me as though I were a monster. That's the perfect word to describe you. Stop it! I'm not a referee! Or I'm the one who'll leave. Are we going home? OK, for you. And please don't apologize! What should I apologize for? Enough! I've always turned a blind eye to the relationships Riyad had with my girls, as long as they remained discreet. What I hadn't noticed, or didn't want to notice, was that my son had fallen head over heels for Paloma. Hey, you! Give the keys to me next time! Yes, ma'am. -She sleeping? -Yes. -Thanks. -Don't mention it. Sorry about all this. About what happened... I'm used to it. At home, with my mom... Got many siblings? Yeah. Already tried it? A few times in high school. I still remember when I'd get back to class, the teacher seemed so tiny! I see birds aren't your only passion. Rome. Naples. Venice. A lot of my friends moved to Italy. Seems all the men are handsome there. -I'm living proof. -"Proof"? My dad's Italian. -Your dad's Italian? -Just ask Aldjéria. She can tell you a thing or two, at least I think so. Don't look at me like that. I'll take you to Italy if you want. -How'll you manage that? -You'll see... That summer, everyone thought of Paloma. I think of you, Paloma Paloma had been dancing at the Alhambra for some time. It was going well, too well. I was afraid she'd acquire a taste for it. -Magnificent. -Really? You were watching? As always. -You were sensational. -Thanks. Mr. Bellil had to meet her at the Port Hotel, a hotel I worked with. The place was full, Mr. Bellil! 'Bye, Mr. Bellil. -See you tomorrow, Paloma. -See you tomorrow. Paloma refused to lead him on. She wanted Mr. Bellil to break without being provoked. I was losing patience. -Well? -No. And what was brewing between her and my son... Should I put an end to it? And Djaffar had no news about the baths. Yes, counselor. Sorry, we can't take your case. Shéhérazade, give her the list of associations. Have you heard anything or not? OK. Here, ma'am. There are few associations. Oh? They've gone missing too. Thanks. -Your son? -Yes. -You'll find him, God willing. -God willing. 'Bye, ma'am. Nothing, her son's missing. -Send her to Human Rights. -We did. I had a strange dream. I'd dreamt that the Caracalla Thermal Baths had been sold, and turned into a bazaar. And that I was shopping there, as if it were completely normal. There were cashiers, like in a supermarket. They called out to me, "Mrs. Aldjéria!" Don't worry, I speak to Mr. Merad almost daily. He assures me we have every chance. I can't talk, I'm driving. I'll call as soon as I hear anything. When Djaffar was involved with someone, he had time for nothing else. -You were smoking hot! -Thanks. Now go and start a fire up there. Did you hear them, Mr. Bellil? They were singing, I Think of You, Paloma. You were brilliant! Thanks. I think of you, Paloma Hand me my clothes, please? Good-bye, Mr. Bellil. Wait. I want to kiss you, on the lips! -Let go of me! -Please, just a little kiss. Forgive me, Paloma. Don't apologize. It's not your fault. I'll be at the Port Hotel at 11 a.m. tomorrow. 11 a.m. tomorrow, Port Hotel. So soon? Not good? Sure, but we'll have to move fast. Then what're you waiting for? Call your mom. -You OK? -Yes, fine! Don't worry, it'll go smoothly. -Don't just stand there! -We have time. My husband's very punctual. See? Go downstairs and call as soon as he arrives. -Let's go. -I'm counting on you. -'Morning. -'Morning. See that? He didn't warn us. -'Morning. -'Morning. -I'm expected. -Papers, please. -Room 25. -Thanks. Careful! Wait. Wait! Please wait! Come. Come... Sit down. Sariyah. His ID. -Mrs. Aldjéria. -Thanks, Sariyah. Well? We wait a while longer. Riyad! What're you waiting for? -Why didn't you call us? -I didn't see him arrive. Go back downstairs and don't let anyone in. -Damn boy! -Come what may! Mr. Bellil, I'm your wife's lawyer. Recording of adultery. Thank you. How'd it go? -How'd it go? -Normally. "Normally"? Want a play-by-play? Paloma! Barely over the commotion, and already back at work! -That girl'll go far. -Maybe... True, she's still resisting, but I think she's starting to like it. That's really important. I'm afraid he may be in love. -We need to talk. -Let go of me! -We need to talk! -Can't you see I'm busy? Wanna dance? -Paloma! -Love... It's all about love. Shéhérazade... You wouldn't wanna be in love? Who doesn't dream of being in love? Your mom proud of herself? Ask her. You're in love, right? It's plain as day! Look at her flaunting herself! -Who's that over there? -My brother. Your brother? Does he mind my dancing with you like this? No, he's very modern. Hey, that smuggler assured me we'd get our visas. -I don't have any money! -Chickening out, huh? Your mom's loaded, why not help yourself? -She hides it away in a safe! -So? Break into it! Want me to help you? Might as well get drunk! I'd love to put Baya on a boat and set her -adrift for all eternity! -Aldjéria, please. Forget about her! The Bellil case is finished, and the baths a sure thing. The Commission president is a former Human Rights minister! -Yes, I know. -Those people are considerate! -What? -Nothing. -What's so funny? -Hamdoullah. I love him when he pays I love him when he treats me I love him when he's alone An Iranian industrialist wants to spend the night with us. Go get him. -From a patron. -My! Champagne... I told you that girl would go far. 'Evening! Hope I'm not intruding. -Not at all, have a seat! -Thanks. One should never drink alone. Drinking alone is evil. Baya... Can you do me a favor? If you ask nicely, sweetie. I'd love to! Is your new whore up to speed? -Get lost! -Bitch! -Stop, Paloma! -I'll break your face! -Security! -I'll destroy her! You disgust Riyad, he doesn't want you anymore! -Bitch! -Never come back here. Angry, Baya? You wanna murder us? She's not used to this. You wretch! This isn't a seedy dive! This is a four-star joint! The more he bangs me, the more I love him The drunker he gets me, the more I love him Let go of me! Riyad! Come out, Riyad! -Stop, Baya. -You shut up! I love you, Riyad! Come out! -I'll call you a cab. -Come out if you're a man! Come out, Riyad! Never lose hope It's never too late I still love him Never lose hope It's never too late I still love him Your absence is a burden Your exile is a burden Why so much resentment? Your absence is a burden, love Your exile is a burden Why so much resentment? Charge! That's Mr. Benbaba, former Human Rights and National Solidarity minister, who presided over the Privatization Commission. He wasn't greedy, not in the way I expected him to be! Don't thank me. Besides, any excuse is good for a party! That's what I always say! You eat barbecue with your fingers. -She's a connoisseur. -Thanks, sweetie. Have fun, my love. My wife has always dreamt of having a boy, but fate had other plans. He'd even organized a barbecue with the chipa I'd given him. Forget it. -What'd she say? -Nothing. -No, I don't like meat. -People like that exist? I forgot to tell you, Mr. Benbaba, Paloma'll be our ambassador, the Aldjéria Thermal Baths representative. I'll handle the beauty aspect. I'll be in charge of the beauty salon. Excellent choice. I'm counting on you, girls! -I'll do my best. -So will I, Mr. Benbaba. I think of you, Paloma -Bravo! -Thanks. I can't believe you know that song! Always stay in touch with the people! That's my motto. I thought I was finally home in Fouka, at the Aldjéria Baths. The Aldjéria Thermal Baths... It's a brilliant idea. -You like it? -A lot. What does Caracalla mean anyway? It doesn't speak to us! Is Aldjéria your real name? -It's a nom de guerre. -War veteran? No, national benefactress. "Benefactress"... A toast to our national benefactress! May the Aldjéria Thermal Baths bring us health, beauty and youth. To good health! -To youth... -I have a surprise. "A surprise"? Be right back. -What kind of surprise? -You'll see. You seem worried. They're the real deal. I had the Fleur Du Jour reopened just for us. I never got diarrhea! Hot? No, it's nothing. Two Paloma Delights! Eat, it'll do you good. You know, Mr. Benbaba, the Caracalla Baths are vital to me. Mrs. Zineb Agha, it's a big risk you're making me take. You know things have changed. Algeria's like Europe now. They throw you in jail over a trifle now. And the press'll sling mud at you over nothing. Can you imagine the headlines? "A minister sells state property to a mafiosa." 60 for you, 40 for me. Nothing scares you off! Like I said, this is vital to me. No. 40 for me, 60 for you. That's right. When you've been Human Rights and National Solidarity minister, you can't be insensitive to an old whore like you. "Whore" maybe, but not "old." Is it a real one? -You like birds? -Yes. Then it's a fake! Me too. What fun they're having! Mr. Benbaba... How beautiful! I'd love to send them on a trip. -Send who on a "trip"? -Your son and my wife... Why? To the Balearic Islands for a week, they'd love it! Let go of me! Cut it out! Forgive her, Mrs. Benbaba. She's handicapped. -She called me an old hag! -She can't even speak! -She went... -Gibberish! Stop. Everyone into the water! To the sea? No, the sea's polluted. Into the pool! Come baptize your pool, Mrs. Aldjéria! Be right there. I want to go. Come, Paloma. You're plastered. I am, and I like it. He's completely sloshed! Don't worry, he'll sober up. Come. Let's go join the Benbabas. I'll meet you there. -He knows everything. -Who? Mr. Benbaba knows all about me. It's only natural, he's the Commission president. Former ministers know everything about everyone. He wants to send Riyad and his wife on a trip. So? Your son's no spring chicken! If it'll help things, where's the harm? Stop drinking, you can't handle it! Whaddaya want from me? -You can't handle it. -Leave me alone! Think you're better than me? Paloma! -Why are you following me? -Paloma! -Paloma... -Let go of me! Are you hurt? -Paloma! -Stop calling me Paloma! I'm sorry. -I don't see the boy here. -Mrs. Aldjéria! -Yes? -Come here. -Where's the boy? -Your son. -He can't be far. -Go get him. -Have you seen my son? -Which is your son, ma'am? -A cognac, please. -Coming right up. -This'll give you strength. -I don't drink. Do we have any Coke? -No coke, sir. -Water. Open this sluice and you get as much as you want! Here, it's spring water. Thanks. I think you're right, this is a fiasco. OK, stop! Polluted or not, everyone into the sea! You look like him. -What's your name? -Zouina. Bilal. The likeness is uncanny! -Have you seen them? -No, sir. They can't be far. Maybe in the ruins. Go find them. Riyad! Riyad! Caracalla was the straw that broke the camel's back. My activities came out in public: procuring, corruption, illegal acquisition of state property. And this time, I couldn't bribe my way out of it. I got busted so that others could get off scot-free. Caracalla's crown was too heavy for my little head. She was screaming her head off, "Riyad! Riyad!" Poor Baya! Any news of her? Yeah, she managed to get a visa for France. Yep... Traveling builds character. But she got deported, she's doing Sofia Square now. How sad! When I was in prison, I met deported girls. From Spain, France, Italy... Everywhere. Even Egypt, believe or not! Know anyone on this earth who likes Algerians? Reminds me of a song by Cloclo: I'm Mr. Unpopular. -Know it? -Of course. I miss Riyad. -You gotta put that in a bag. -Put what in a bag? Drivers don't like beer bottles in their cabs anymore. -What do I care? -Mrs. Aldjéria... Don't worry, I still have good legs. See you soon, Mrs. Aldjéria. Not a wrinkle in three years. Some said my son's death was divine punishment. But for me, Riyad and Paloma are in Italy. I often dream of Riyad on a train crossing Naples, Venice, Rome... In first class, of course. I can see my grandson running to catch up with his dad. Little Nanni lays his head on his knees. Riyad reads his newspaper. Paloma's there, her nose in a book. In front of them, their two daughters playing. I also see myself at the train bar. I hear Riyad asking his son, "Where's Grandma?" The boy answers, "At the bar, where else?" Riyad laughs, so does Paloma. She wants great palaces Of pink marble Replete with staircases For her sleepless nights Hanging gardens Hanging over time Where her lovers will meet She wants love, Perfect and flawless In the deep Of far-off horizons A bittersweet bite of ideals She wants the start without the finish She wants so many things To knock down the sky With half-closed eyes A spark And that the night rise In her heart She wants something new She wants so many things To dream her life In her dream lives To cross the sky To run off She wants something new She wants new dresses Turn over a new leaf A designer heart In red satin Always going back to square one She wants a fiesta She wants it lively She wants every sunset The gold of the flesh Exhilaration, glory Naked truth, a sight to behold She wants everything She wants chaos She wants so many things To knock down the sky With half-closed eyes She wants that spark That the night rise once more In Technicolor She always wants something new She wants so many things To crack open the sky To hoist up a flag And take you all for a ride And write it out in the sky She wants something new
