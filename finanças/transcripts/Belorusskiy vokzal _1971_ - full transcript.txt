Stefanski Creative Association 'Tovarishch' - Hello, Viktor. - Hello. This is how the things stand, brother... I think I saw Dubinski. Really? Is he gone already? But he knew that I am here. There he is. Well, hello, I guess. Why were you sitting there? I was thinking. I see. Let's go? Oh, here goes Vanya. I came too late. Now it's everyone. Everyone is here. What a blow. How was he buried? Was there a salute? Were those his soldiers? I met them at the gate. Yes, there was a salute. Hello, Ivan. Jesus, hi, Vitya. Nikolai! Liosha! Do you remember when we all met last? September 27, 1946. On his birthday. Yup. There was tons of spirit, but only potatoes in the jackets to eat. Yeah, and we still in our army jackets. - Well, this is probably it. - What do you mean? We should, you know... for Valya and for our meeting. Yup. We are Russians after all. Sure. - I'd have to go back to work. - Oh, you are so indispensable. Well, I have to. Eh, get in. - So I don't say goodbye, Kolya, right? - Yes, gut. Hey, really, don't be silly. Who knows when we'll see each other next? Ok, sure. - Blockhead. - Isn't it that our wagon? No. The plates were similar. Seriously, no. None of our cars is here. All of them are at the plant. What do you mean, no cars? And who is transporting scrap? How should I know? I just saw the operator distributing the tasks. - Go back to the plant, hurry up! - I can't turn here. Look for a turn, a short cut, whatever you want, but hurry up! - Bossman, you'll get dirty! - Don't worry, it'll wash off. How are things with the metal? Bad. But I am not to blame. I went to Balashov myself. What a mess! The metal we have will last only a couple of hours. Balashov is right, we can't work without a magazine. - What about there? No space? - Well, it's possible to put it there. But what are we do? Fly over it? - You were looking for me? - Yes, I am looking for you, just one moment. You asked me not to interfere with your things. - Right? - Yes I did. You see... Balashov, I don't understand you. You are the Chief Engineer. You have to understand that a foundry shop can't stop working. I understand that. We gather scrap here, on the plant. I gave an order. If we run out of metal, for every minute of foundry's down time I'll withhold from your salary. Well, do as you please. Please, understand me, there is no risk. We've calculated, it?s better for the plant... Cut it off, I am responsible for production. Put the cars back and let's not quarrel. - Well, this wasn?t my point. - But it?s my point. - Well, wasn't it quick? - Lightning. All right. Now let them complain. Some people here were complaining about me. Romantics. - Is Volodya back for long? - 10 days excluding traveling. Did he see his father before he died? We were stranded on Dikson because of the snow. - Viktor, do you have cigarets? - In my coat. Please, meet my friends. My friends from the war front. - Nice to meet you. - Prikhod'ko. - Kiriushin. - General Pukhov. So you were fighting together with Matveev? Yessir, General, Sir. In the same battalion. The First Belorussian Front. I was to the north of you... freeing northern Poland and conducted a forced crossing of the Oder, near Szczecin. Please let me pass. This is not the best place to stand, comrades. Pardon. Gramp, where is your... - Sedatives? - First-aid kit. - It is in the kitchen. How is she? - Well, she's just sitting. Is she crying? She will not get through this. What can we do, we have to start. We can't keep all these people waiting. You need to ask, not to rummage through other people's things. Excuse me. - Have you had lunch? - Ugh, I s?pose not. Let's go. Katia, dear, feed comrade driver. You may as well help us out a bit. - Do you know how to open the bottles? - Well, this ain?t difficult. Well, I suppose, you'd love to have a drink too? I warn you, here, in the center, road policemen are like animals. That's all right. Well, see for yourself. - You'll hurt your hands! Take a corkscrew. - Thank you. Viktor Sergeevich, thank you for coming and helping out. Hello, Liosha. There was something I wanted to do... Ah, yes. There... His personal things, maybe you'll want to take something as a souvenir? I want you to take something. - Lida, I have left my work and home phone numbers. - Thank you. - Call me anytime. - Thank you. But please, call. Don't feel embarrassed. - Thank you, don't worry. - I'll visit in a couple of days. - Liosha, do you live in Moscow now too? - No, I am going back today. But I'll be in Moscow soon. We will not leave you on your own. - How are you, Lida? - All's good, Dad. - Thank Heaven. Let's go. - How's Volodya? - Just a minute, he feeds the little one. Viktor Sergeevich, Liosha, let's go. And than he would come on a leave and the house would be brighter. Otherwise me and madame were alone all the time. And the evenings are long. - Well, but there?s TV. - What about TV? It's just a box. Eat, please, eat more. I like people who eat heartily. I never though that I would have to talk on Valya's funeral feast. It?s not normal for old people to have to grieve the young. Normal is when the contrary happens. Maybe those who knew Valentin better than I did... You, Lida... Or his sister Anastasia Ivanovna, or his friends... Probably, they would be able to speak about him better. I didn't fight alongside him but I can tell you the kind of soldier he was. A Communist and a soldier... He was a real fighter, who didn't break at defeats and get spoiled by victories. And I?d like to add that he wasn't a goody. He was straightforward and strict with others. And he had a right to be. Because he was very strict and had no mercy for himself either. He... was... Excuse us. We came here to see comrade Colonel. Could we see him just for a second, if possible. My father is not here. Is this the apartment of Colonel Matveev? He has died. Excuse us please. - What about the suitcase? - It is for the Colonel. Our friends asked to give it to him. It's smoked cisco. Lida, don't. Please, don't, my dear. Please, don't. Calm down. Listen, Gramp, clear the table, do me a favor. All these drinks and food. Let's postpone this. - Where is Ivan? - Devil knows. Excuse me, Viktor Sergeevich. Uncle Liosha... I didn?t recognized you. - Hello, Volodya. - Hello. The situation is awkward, but I hope you?ll stay? Don't worry. All's good. - What name did you give to your son? - Valentin. Take care of your mother. Hold on, Matveev. Don't count your chicken until they're hatched, as they say. - Can I come in? - Oh, yes, please, come in. But all in all, I am really grateful. Please, tell the whole brigade that I am extremely grateful. Well, all the best. Nikolai Ivanovich, I?ve wanted to see you since morning, I wanted to talk to you. - Did you go to the bank? - No, to the cemetery. What will we do with you, Nikolai Ivanovich? What can you do with me? Why are you saying this? This way it will never work out. Let's talk. Like normal people. All right, I will try my best. Nikolai Ivanovich, we have been working together for half a year now and we still don't understand each other. - Such a situation is not normal. - I agree. Yesterday I had a meeting in the Chief Directorate. They asked me what was happening with our chief accountant. There are rumors around. I told them it was nothing. I went, I have nothing to reproach Dubinskiy for. Nothing to reproach... Well, maybe only... for being a little bit too pedantic. Well, but this is... Our officer used to say that every wrinkle on our blanket is a creep-hole for the agents of imperialism. And he was right to a certain extent. To a certain extent... I do not understand one thing. I remember your personal file very well. 20 years of impeccable work. Veteran. 8 war decorations. I thought that we?d move mountains together. Nikolay Ivanovich, what are you afraid of? Catching a cold. There?s nothing else I could be afraid of. Why haven't you endorsed my order concerning Sofronov's brigade? It?s unlawful. The instruction issued by the Ministry on May 28, 1949, prohibits spending. What about my latest order? The one from yesterday? There is an instruction issued on October 2, 1954. It seems that while you ride the train you are fast asleep! Wake up, dear! Wake up, Dubinskiy! You missed your stop a long time ago! 1949... You had to get off sometime around 1956. Excuse the straightforwardness, but it?s impossible to work this way. You?re on my back with your hardened bureaucratism. I?ll tell you this. You can shout at me, insult me. I?ll be able to live on my pension, of course. And you?ll get an obedient flunky in my place. Someone bendable... You will jump one outdated instruction with him, then the other. And then you will smash your face into a bloody mess... Because your whole philosophy is contained in one single word - 'perhaps'. Perhaps it will pass, perhaps it will go down. The winner takes all. You?re a brave young man. You?ve got a good head on your shoulders. You're very energetic. So why don't you go to the Chief Directorate, to the Ministry? Go and argue there, fight, bite... do whatever you want, but make sure that they cancel these outdated instructions. But as long as they... As long as I... Nikolai Ivanovich, are you all right? Liubov Dmitrievna, come here for a second. What?s wrong? What?s the matter with you? Do you have your medicine on you? Is it your heart? - What?s happened? - Please get a doctor, quick. Pour him some water or, better, if you have some brandy. Yes, I have some. Are you sure? May he have some? I need some. It dilates the vessels. Thank you. - Just a moment... - Please, stay here. I?ll go and see about the car. Do not worry. It will go away soon. No, please stay here. It?s better for you to sit calmly now. - Have you come to see me, comrade? - No, I am his comrade. - I see, good. - Will you stay here? - Yep. - I'll go and see about the car. Don't worry. We have a car. Nikolai Ivanovich, what?s happened? It's a fine mess... Please, excuse me. Have lunch without me. Who was calling? You need to ask! How many times do I have to repeat the same thing, Polina? I don't know. Probably late. Did you recognize the voice? It wasn't Balashov, was it? It's all right, it's all right! All right, I?m wrapping myself and buttoning up. I?m not taking it off. All right, see you. - You?ll be the one I?ll send to fetch my death. - I know. - Nice. Clean and full of light. - Like an aquarium. - Vanya, let?s switch seats, please. - Why's that? I don't like sitting with my back to the door. Who would have thought... - Sausages, fried eggs... - What about grilled meat? None. But the prices! Oh, all right. Too much of the good life has spoiled you. We used to dream about tinned rations. You know what I miss lately? The Army. There you just stand in the line and think about your own things. They order you to turn left - you turn left, "forward march" - and you march. Where to? Why? Well, they know where to. The main thing is to be in step, and you can think about things. - And what were you thinking about? - I s'pose, how good civilian life was. Guys, I am in no mood for laughing. What the hell... Maybe I just don't get it? Earlier I knew what was allowed and what wasn?t. But now... They say: "more independence, more initiative". But what are the limits of this independence? How should I know? Today I take the initiative and tomorrow I'll get it in the neck. - These are not funny jokes. - I'm serious. I am tired. You refuse to support shady deals and you get called a die-hard conservative, bureaucrat or whatever names they can think of. - But you are a bureaucrat. - See, here you go! Independence, my ass! For instance, you can be a bureaucrat or a loafer, yet I still can't fire you from my plant. You'll sue me to death. You and your type, just give you an inch, you?ll take a mile! There was not a single week the entire last year without some commission getting on my nerves! I got used to it. If there's no one for two days, I get bored. I?m not running things at the plant. - We've seen. - You've seen nothing! Balashov? He only looks like a wimp. Walking, melancholy all over his face. Do you know how much of my blood he has drained? He arrived there after all the hard work was done! When I was appointed to this plant, they were producing spoons. They didn't know how to make a hole in a colander. There was an engineer and a half on the entire plant! And now we have an engineering department, product development... You saw only Balashov, while I have thousands of them. Try to hustle the way I hustle. I need to think about the plan and quality, and little 'bonuses' for the workers and all of this without additional investments. I'd rather we talk about girls. Huh? I am bored with this. See this? Oh Vanya! You all think this way. Full coffers and good food and you?re set. - Are you ready to order? - Not yet. One minute, please. This goes without discussion. Yes, please. - A bottle of brandy... - Vodka?d be better. - Listen to me. - Well, to me it?s all the same who I listen to. We don't have spirits. - How come? - Just like that! - What about beer? - No beer. - What do you have then? - Punch, cocktail, dry wine, coffee, ice-cream. Then bring us cocktails. Four cocktails. - Is that it? - What else? - I don't know. - That's it. Well, this is not how one goes to the restaurant. There's a shop nearby... Stop fluttering around and sit down! - Then what? Pouring it under the table, just like... - All right, all right. - Are we allowed to smoke here? - Well, there are ashtrays around. What are you looking at? Don't you recognize me? - Vanya, where's your moustache? - Moustache? Mixing things up, comrade bossman? I've never had any moustache. It grows weird. - Dubinskiy had a moustache. - Really? - Sclerosis? - And what about you? The same. That's all right, I'll retire soon. I have a small plot in the country. 5 ares. ? It has electricity. - Do you have a cow? - No. - Get one. And a couple of chickens. - Oh, lay off it, Vanya. - How many kids do you have? - Two. A boy and a girl. - What about you, Ivan? - Four. 'cause there's no electricity in our summer cottage. - Where is it? Well, there ain?t no summer cottage either. Summers we spend with my mother-in-law, in a smaller city. Will you be on time for you train? What the hell! I was standing there, at the cemetery, my head understood that it was Valya Matveev lying there, but my heart didn?t understand. As if it were not his funeral. As if he is yet to come. Do you remember how he used to walk, waddling. That's exactly it. He will never come up to us. Never. And we are screaming the loudest we can and make the most of our guitars. Why should we be quieter? We'd better play louder and for you. Well, fellows-recruits, time to go home? It?s not even the kids? bedtime. Let's go to my place. Let's buy some good meat, I'll cook it myself. - Hell, why not. D?you remember that horse? - Oh, Ivan, come on! I gotta stop by my place so the situation doesn?t escalate. Well then... So that's it. We sat for a while, chatted a bit - and that's it? All right, be well. Wait! Wait! Ivan! Don't act the fool, will you? I?m telling you, let's go some place. - I left in the evening and since... - Get in. We will issue you a document about your courageous defence. Well, mine is a person with attitude, but let's stop by. Just in case. - Well, I am off to give myself up. - Good luck. Little Sergey is fidgeting with his potty on the floorboard. Your lunch is in the kitchen. Mother said that she wouldn't reheat it 20 times a day. Who let you take tools without permission? Dad, Leshka took your keys as well. You're a piece of work, aren't you? - Haven't they taught you a thing or two at school about tales? - They have. Well, not enough, apparently. Why are you like that, Lyuba? What's wrong? You think that I... You well know that we've buried Matveev. Then we got together for a while. Now we are going to Dubinskiy for an hour or so. The guys are waiting in the car. Whatcha up to there? Go on, get out! - Nope! - Oh, you'll get a beating! - You'll get one yourself! - ?nuf talking. Got stuck you little imp? Oh boy, but you?re a fake. Go now, go and play. What's wrong? I mean, really? Did I come home drunk? Well? If you want, tell me and I?ll not go. But it?ll be awkward. Whew, if you only saw Kharlamych! Important man! Liosha Kiriushyn. Dubinskiy?s there too. All our guys. We left the cemetery, you see, and it was so gloomy... Valya, well, he was the favourite. And we're standing there... We haven't seen each other for years... There's never any time to look around. We're standing there, you see... - What's wrong with you? - What's wrong? Do you remember how we were drifting with Tonia? And none of them, neither Kharlamych, nor Valya... All right, let him rest in peace... But no one! They knew all right how after the war you had roamed the hospitals for two years. Did you write to them then? Why don't you answer? Give it a rest! A lot?s happened since then. What is... No point mixing them all together - It hurts, Vanya. You have no pride. - Cut it off, you know... No pride at all. Now you will go and drink vodka with them, remembering what heroes you were on the front. You keep out of this. Right. But my war did not end in 1945. I hadn't written to anyone. - Dad, your Peter came over, he took the keys. - What for? - Something happened at your section. - Why haven't you told me? You've got me all mixed up. - I've been meaning to ask you... - Since yesterday, have you? Why no, for a long time. I?ve ruined your life, did I? Vanya, you're a fool. My God, you're such a fool. I?m in a bit of a pickle here. Could you give me a lift, it's not far? Dad, you forgot it again! Well, little fella, go on home now. - I will not hold you back. - That's all right, no worries. A pity this has happened... My workmate is a green fluffy pup, fresh from vocational school. - Will you write to me, Ivan? - Sure thing. Slow down here. - Don't you worry, Kharlamych. - What makes you think I worry? Just saying. Kolya, be well! Don't cough. All the best, Ivan. Let me help. Guys, it looks like a cable?s been punched. - Where the hell are you going? - Oh, be quiet! There's another manhole around the corner. Open it, but don't go in. It's a gas pipe. Peter! What's happened to you? Peter! Oh you... - I have switched off the gas, uncle Vanya. - Sweet Jesus... I went from the corner, there's no one there. Wait, not me. Help. You pup. Look at this wacky hero. - Uncle Vanya, I only wanted... - What did you want? - Who allowed you to go there? - Calm down, Ivan. - What's wrong with him? - Received electric shock, didn't you? - A bit... - Don't worry, I'll add to it. Hey, what's wrong, Peter? Lad, what's the matter? Hang on! We need to call an ambulance. Hey, friend, give us a lift to the hospital. There?s a person here who needs help. - We can't. We're late. - What? - I'm telling you that we can't. - Open it, please! I'm telling you, open, please. - Are you deaf? - What? Have you lost your mind or what? I will not carry anyone. - Call a taxi or ambulance. - Please, understand, it's urgent. Please, I am begging you. Please, get away from the car. - Let me go, stop fooling around. - Oh you little nasty bugger. Sasha, please, don't. Get away from the car, old man. I asked you politely. - Who called me little nasty bugger? - I did. I'd love to give you a dusting, but I feel sorry for you. You'll kick the bucket soon enough. Nikolai, are you out of your mind? Don't worry, it's all right. Leave me alone. Leave me alone, I tell you! Hey, let's go? You're going to regret this, bastards. He does not want to. The keys are in the car. Why is he sulking? - I am not going anywhere. - To hell with him. Will you find a hospital? - The one on Sadovoye kol'tso? - Yes, I know. - You forgot this in the car. - Thank you. Surname! - Mine? - No, of the patient. I don't know. - Well, yours then. - Kiriushin Aleksei Konstantinovich. - Your address? - Kaliningrad, Volgogradskiy avenue, 17. - And yours? - Well... Shipilova Natalya Aleksandrovna. - Did you bring that boy? - We did. - What's wrong with him? - A shock. He's better now. Do you want to drive? There's a lot of dirt. You need an antiserum shot. - Sure, and bed rest. - What has happened? - Nothing. He's poking his nose where he shouldn't. - How's Peter? - All is good. He?s started smiling. - Well, enough of this. - Wait, let me tie this first. It all holds on spit and baling wire. Ivan, it shouldn't be like that. Are you messing with things again? - Just look at it! - Don't touch it! What I need now is just another boss! I would?ve hauled you over the coals for this. You wouldn't have recognised your own folks afterwards! This ain't my responsibility. They?re such tightasses about new purchases. Then when it comes to old repairs, they?ve got money. But on the plus side, no additional investments. - Hey, easy. - Sure, easy. You better drag this cable with Liosha instead of standing here. - Where do we drag it from? - Drag it from? From over there! Look at them activists. Heave-ho! Well, Peter was on time. Spare me. His heroics will backfire on someone, truly. I?ll take care of it. Don't be afraid. Wake him up. Give him time to prepare. No, there's no gas. I know it. I would've smelled it. Okay, I will check it up to Gorokhov lane. Bye, that?s it. - Can I get city on this one? - Which city? - Have you gone crazy? - Easy, easy. - Where are we? - In Russia. - Hey, Kerya! - Throw it! - Nikolai! - Thank you, I'm fine. Liosha, why are you so sad suddenly? Missed your train? Don?t interfere. See, man at work, composing an article 'The Blast that Did not Happen' Oh guys, go to hell! Hey you, writer, you have to write, not philosophise. Who's the writer here? Him? Do you remember how our Kerya threatened that he would write a book about war and love. Why would he write books? His life is good anyway. - What's wrong? What's happening? - Are these the ones? - Yes. Follow us. - Follow us. - Hey, fine. But hands off. - But what's wrong? - Ivan, be calm, calm down. - What is happening? What's wrong? - Calm down. Do you need a special invitation? Have you forgotten this again? Oh bloomin' heck! Have any of you seen my tote? - The black one? - Yep. - Well, it had business of its own. Oh you, ham-fisted. Easy. Easy! Look at him, he finds this amusing. I haven't been in a more ridiculous situation in my life. Come on, you?ve been in sillier and more ridiculous situations. No, I?ve not. That's idiotic. Don?t worry, tomorrow they?ll bring some prison broth and cut our hair. But that's fine. They say it grows better afterwards. And then we'll go, comrade Kharlamov, to do some exercises with the broom in the fresh air. Under your leadership... Ivan, stop being a buffoon! - Nikolai! - What are you... Well, that's something. Damn if I know what's wrong with me today. I usually can contain myself. But sometimes I really feel like smashing some bastard's face. I'm really itching to do that. Well, you control yourself until he gets your wallet or throat, you grin and bear, grin and bear... Kolya, you've burned out your fuses. These things happen. No... You know, for a minute I felt as if... Well, how did you feel? You know, I suddenly felt as if I were at the battlefront again. Everything's clear. There's an enemy. Good guys are next to you and our cause is the right one. That's that! In the beginning it was all right, but then it seized me real good. I was hospitaisedl in ?47 and got stuck there for 2 years. The wound wasn't really serious, but some gland got damaged. I thought it was it for me. Such a nuisance, the war was over. But I pulled through and came home. My Lyuba... She was such a beauty, my Lyuba... Until... Well, her life didn't turn out to be so sweet. I came back. She drew a bath for me, had a bottle ready, of course... Clean sheets, everything... And me, you know, I am sitting there like a brute. Completely smashed, of course. I can't say even one kind word to her. I feel short of breath. It can't be, I think to myself, that such a young woman, just in bloom, in 2 years - and not even once... It just can't be. Time passed, but the though stuck in my mind. Once I pretended to go to my shift but stood standing at the building?s entrance waiting. And I see, here she comes. In the new little dress she has never worn before. And a headscarf. She goes... Oh you... Well, - I think to myself, there?s gonna be a murder. And I follow her. I tell myself, it's better not to, better call her. And still, I continue. And then she goes in, can you imagine it? She goes in a church! I haven?t heard her utter a word about Christ in her entire life. Well, I think, so she has a date in this church. I go in, it is very dark in there. Old women. The candles are burning. She takes a candle too, pays 30 roubles and goes to the icons. I follow. And suddenly I hear that she thanks the Lord for the victory, for Stalin and that Him above didn't let me kick the bucket. I wanted to tell her, Lyuba, don't. Let?s get out of this place. You need to thank that professor and Vitya Kharlamov, who carried me on his back through the snow. His feet got frostbitten, yet he carried me. But it feels stupid to have followed her there. Here you go, brother... Why didn't you write? Well, you know, Liosha. Times were tough on everyone. And I thought I would manage myself. - You're a fool. - Eh, all righty, all's good. All's good. What the hell is this? Well, indeed. I don't understand you, guys. We're whining and worrying, but no one stirs a finger to leave this place. - What do you mean, leave? - The door is over there, go. - Go to hell. It's locked. Well, go and try it. Get your ass off the bench. You're a mechanic. Alexei, are you out of your wits? Liosha! Guys, quit fooling around. Vitya, move. Are you out of your minds? Honestly, what kind of horseplay is this? Kolya, what's wrong with him? Oh you... - What do you want? - Please, come through. Sign please. - May I go? - You may. Fine mess it is. What am I supposed to do now? Get personal information from these comrades, please, their names, addresses. Then you can press charges against them. I can't do anything else for you. - So you will just let them go? - Yep. 5 minutes after you leave. What's your name? I will file a complaint. My name is Lieutenant Voronkov. Let me give you another piece of advice: don't hang around the station for more than 5 minutes because you may need to look for eyewitnesses again. - Thank you. - You are welcome. - Good bye. - All the best. A polite one. Why didn't you explain this to me from the very beginning? Well, thank goodness, we got that straightened out. Sorry. But you are also something, you know. Got used to shouting at people. - Good bye. - All the best. Long live freedom! Oh, quiet. - Have you missed your train? - Ah, to hell with it. How is it here by you, in the capital? Everything is closed already, right? Look here, guys. I know one place. Where is it? - I want somewhere clean and bright. - Oh Vanya, you and your ideas again... Don't worry. Thank you, Natasha. Oh, that's nothing, indeed. They wait for you. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. Let's go. It will be clean and warm there for you. We get off here? - Good evening! - Hello. - How are you? - Thank you, not bad. Vitya, follow me. We aren't expected. Who are you looking for? Ivan, you and your childish pranks again! - Excuse us. - Jesus! Guys! Raya! That's all right. Kolya! Dubinushka, is that you?.. Lioshka, you... Vanya, how could you? Take that! Guys, this is you, indeed! If you are all together and looking like this, it must be you! - Are you gonna let us in or not? - Come in, come in. How?d you get yourself so dirty? Aren't your wives keeping an eye on you? - Nah, rather on TV. - Good? - Yep. - It's ticklish! - Hey, get back in line! Oh guys, you are so well-rounded now! Liosha, where are your scars? A bit lower. Oh, old lady, already forgotten, have you? - But they are barely visible. - You've always healed as good as a dog. Well, you manage yourself here, I'll be back in a sec. Why did you keep us in the dark, bastard? You should get it in the neck for these jokes of yours. Oh, sure, go on. Damn, how should we tell her? Vanya, it's all it says, who else! Valya looks real smart. Well, rogues, are you hungry? What a strange question. - Do you need help? - Oh, come on, I'll manage myself. Go and join other guys. - Let me peel potatoes at least. - All right. Don't go on a spree. We brought sausage and cheese. I think that should be enough. Oh, be quiet. You better tenderise it properly. Kolya is an authority when it comes to meat. Have a heart, don't pound it so hard. Ok, I'll take care of the sausage. Hey! Careful. You may hurt someone. So... Everyone's busy. And you, why are you here, to boss us around? He can?t be trusted with anything anyway. Well, Vitya, dear, you come under Ivan?s command. Vanya, keep an eye on him. - Could I entrust him with getting rid of potato eyes, huh? ? You can. That?s it. The lady of the house is driven out. What a temper! Still the same as before! - Raya! Do you have a phone? - There, in the hall. All right, I'll do it later. - Vitya, where's your sleeve? - Tear away the other one too. Ivan, why didn't you tell us where we were going? Why on Earth you were silent? - I forgot. - How come? - And you, did you remember her? - I thought about her. - He thought... Hey, Kerya, why do you behave as if we were a total mess, and you rub our noses in it. As if you had all your things sorted out perfect. - I am the same as you. Look everyone, he's not sparing himself. Should we decorate you for that? Your apartment is really nice. Is it co-operative? Ah no! The state issued it to me. We used to live in a real shack. But it was happier in there. We'd gather, 9 women in the kitchen, hell was let loose! - You got two rooms for yourself? - I am not alone; there are two of us. - Two? - Me and my daughter. Why didn't Vanya report? He met her. Well, he'll get it... - How old is you daughter? - She's big already. Taller than me. - Should I salt it? - No, I'll do it myself. Well, go and sit at the table. Everything's ready. But wash your hands, urchins. - Raya, where do you work? - I am a sister of mercy. Is that a nurse? Sister of mercy. Vitya, you of all people! Just listen to the sound of it... sister of mercy! I see that you aren't generals either? Well, no. He's a general, but civil. - Really? - Yeah, listen to him more. You should be respectful to him. If something goes against his will, he immediately starts shouting: 'Where is your boss?'. - Oh, you bigmouth. Guys, this is really nice of you to come. You don't even know yourself what a great thing you've done. - Yeah, we're like that. - For me just a drop. - Why's that? - I quit. - Liosha, why are you silent? - Let him be silent. - I worry less when he's silent. - Me too. Guys, let's drink. For all the good things. There were more good ones than bad. Where's bread? - Where did you get so dirty? - There was an episode. Why didn?t Valya come? He was here in winter, he found me. He came with wine, with flowers. Such an escapade, right? He saw my daughter and goes: Let's marry her and my Volodya! We'll drink this up, he says, and catch a plane, all of us, and go to Volodya, to Dikson Island. We almost did it, by God! Valya died. Ivan, check things in the kitchen, something there?s burning. - When? - The funeral was today. How could you... Kolya, you really are off your game today. - Leave him alone. - This is not a way to do things! Maybe it is not, maybe it is. I don't know. My Polina brought me a doctor recently, full of inkhorn terms. He said that drinking is bad, smoking is bad, being nervous... He said that one should spare himself. He had such strange ears. As if covered by moss. I'd ask Valya now if he regrets that he didn?t spare his nerves, that he wasn't egotistical at the front and didn't whore himself afterwards? That he didn't hide behind his father-in-law general's back, but went to the middle of nowhere as a battalion commander, that he lived as a human being, not as... - Right you are. Don't worry, Vitya, we're gonna make it. Raya, sing for us. Vanya, how can I? Sing. Sing, Raya! Our song, of the 10th water-resistant battalion. Our favorite. Birds do not sing here, trees do not grow. Only we, shoulder to shoulder, grow here into the earth. The planet is burning and spinning. There is a smoke over our Motherland. This means we need only victory, one and for all - whatever it will cost. One and for all - whatever it will cost. The deathly fire is what awaits us, and yet it has no power over us. Away with doubts, goes in the dark night fearless, our 10th assault battalion, our 10th assault battalion. The moment battle faded we get another order. A postman will go crazy trying to find us. The red rocket flies high, the machine gun is tireless. This means we need only victory, one and for all - whatever it will cost. One and for all - whatever it will cost. The deathly fire is what awaits us, and yet it has no power over us. Away with doubts, goes in the dark night fearless, our 10th assault battalion, our 10th assault battalion. From Kurs and Orel the war has brought us under the enemy's gates. Brother, that's what?s happened. One day we will remember this and won?t believe it ourselves. But today we need only victory, one and for all - whatever it will cost. One and for all - whatever it will cost. The deathly fire is what awaits us, and yet it has no power over us. Away with doubts, goes in the dark night feraless, our 10th assault battalion. Our 10th assault battalion. - Valya... - Oh, Mom. Do you want something to eat? No. Why aren't you sleeping? This is Kharlamych, commander of our engineer company. Vanya, commander of our reconaissance unit. Dubinushka - radio operator. Liosha Kiriushin - mineman and demolitionist. Mom, what about Matveev? Sleep. THE END
