Oh, shit. What happened? What the fuck is this? Damn. This whole thing is too high. Oh, Mr. George, help us. Help us! He doesn't understand what I'm saying. Help us! - Help us. - Sorry. You fucking pig! Don't go away. You fucking pig! - I wanna get out of here! - Shut up! I'm gonna tie your coat to this. - Please, take it off. - You take it off. Okay. I throw this end out... and it will catch something, ok? Hang on to this end so it won't... won't fly off. Fucking motherfucker! Motherfucking shit! - Okay. Hold it tight! - Okay. Okay. Shit! Nadja, we are only short a little bit now. Please! Smoking is prohibited! No. I heard so much bad about this route that I'm not going in there. No, I'm not going in there, no way! Don't you understand what I'm saying? You don't understand what I'm saying? This is my last word: No! You are a total wacko! Which part of "no" don't you understand? I'm telling you for the last time, you faggot, I won't go in there! Why do I have to be shouting all day? Try to understand that I'm not going on that route, because I'm not! Fucking hell, enough is enough. It's very dangerous, and I'm not driving there, whatever happens. There is absolutely no way that I'm going in there.
