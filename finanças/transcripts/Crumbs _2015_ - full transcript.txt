I brought you a Christmas fir... for your garden of dwarf trees. I love you, my Bird y. I love you too. Where is your amulet? I lost it. Don't let them push you around, Candy. Are you a chicken? The bowling machine started working on its own again. It's like... a huge magnetic field is directed towards it. I'm falling asleep. It's been a hard day. Maybe... someone is trying to send us a signal. Who, my Bird y? I don't know. Perhaps... the spaceship. People say... that the spaceship has been rusting in the sky since the beginning of the big war. Very interesting! It's a Samurai Turtle figurine, made in the third century and worn by Molegon warriors as a lucky amulet. Industrially made from a rubber mold with acrylic paint, it is believed that the inspiration dates back to pre-apocalypse years. What do you want to do? Sell it? Pawn it? - I wanna sell it. - How much? 56,000 Crols. I've seen several of these in recent years. They're very difficult to sell nowadays. I'll give you 1,500 Crols. Rethink your offer, Grandpa. Please! That's funny! You think you can intimidate me with a Gamo Turbo? Not even a child would be scared! Hello! Hello! What happened, my candy? Nothing. I'm dizzy. Sometimes, I think... that maybe I'm not strong enough for you. One day I might get killed in that dessert. My Bird y. Listen.. Who loves you like I do? Who? I'll visit the witch, ask her what's happening. Are you okay? You're acting strange. I'm okay. This sword was manufactured by Carrefour. The last total artist. It will protect you during your trip. Einstein IV. San Pablo Picasso. Stephen Hawking Ill. Justin Bieber VI. Paul McCartney XI. Carrefour! We'll meet in the spaceship. In that garden of vegetables. I want your wisdom. I dream of you. The "Max Steel" sword. Highly regarded back in its heyday, as only 490,000 units were produced. It was used by Molegon warriors. Its maker was not the Second Carrefour but Mattelo. The design is believed to date back to the pre-apocalypse. Do you want to sell it? - Yes, I wanna sell it. - How much do you want? 93,000 Crols seems good to me. I'm interested in acquiring a "Max Steel", but not for that price. I can offer you 2,600 Crols. 18,600. 3,500, last offer. What about 5,500? 3,500 is my last offer! I have no choice. It's a total rip-off, you loan shark. Let's sign the contract. Witch? The ducks are coming back. I don't see any ducks. - What do you want? - I need your help. How are you gonna pay me? This is supposed to pay for your wedding. I can't accept it. But I need to find Santa Claus. My back is too old for that job. Be strong. Come on! Clean that side. - Is that enough? - Carry on! Thank you! I see what you see. Santa Claus is inside a dark hole. What else do you see? There's an abandoned pond. It's inside a park. Where is this? It's in the old city. The old city? I'll never get there. It's so far. I don't know the way. The train will guide you. The train? The train. Bird y says that the spaceship is turning on. Is that true? There is someone up there working. - Who's there? - You ask to many questions! So my Bird y is right. I should go. The day is coming. Where are you going? You forgot your record! I don't need it anymore! Take it! I don't need it! There's that sound again. I'm sure that the spaceship is turning on. I know it. Who's there? Where are you? It's a dream. Don't be afraid. Santa Claus will give you anything you want. Do you know? Santa will make it real. It can't be true. I am... a peaceful man. I'm not looking for trouble. Do you know how to turn it back on? Are you deaf? Why don't you speak? The cat got your tongue. You know... I'm not from here. And I don't belong here. I remember where I came from. Crevices in the rocks. Big canyons. And within these cracks, caves carved in quartz where we lived... protected from the frozen winds... that flowed over the surface. ...thtsss horn... ...to the cit... ...Finxzxzx Santa Cla... ...The Spac... ...to my Planet! Michael Jackson's Vinyl. Third century. Popular among the Molegon warriors to instill courage. It is believed that perhaps he was a farmer in the former United States. His music was electrifying. Where did you find it? It was a gift. Do you want to sell it? I'll sell it for 132,000 Crols. That's an old price. I can't accept it nowadays. How much would you give me? I'll give you 40% of whatever I sell it for. You want to trick me? What's going on inside the spaceship? The spaceship? What spaceship? Quit pretending. You know what I'm talking about. I really don't know. Someone is working up there. You know what? Take this as a guarantee for the album. What is this? The train will guide you to the city. What a joke! I recognize the Molegon warrior in you. But the war ended centuries ago. The spaceship is turning back on. My love and I will go back to my planet. A journey through the limits of this strange universe. Nebulae, planets with rings of impossible colors, comets with the longest tails. Then one day, the morning breeze. A day in spring- Fields of wheat. The noise of tractors in the distance. Take the baby! I've seen this lion before. Remember to follow the lions! Oh, now I see. I'm going to be a father. My son will be the new king of the stars. They're coming for you, my son. My real man... You're so handsome. So resistant. Yes... please. He'll be our son. Our son. My love. He's coming for me. Where are you, little girl? Have you been a good girl? I know you're a good girl. Tell me your wish. Tell me your wish, little girl. What do you want? The car, the bear, whatever you want. I can give you everything. Just tell me your wish. I'll make it real. What's wrong? Why don't you talk to me? I can give you anything! Don't hide your wish! You can't hide your wish from Santa Claus! Why aren't you telling me? I'm not a good girl. I'm not. Here's an Andromeda baby figurine. In the late third century, during the brief period of peace, he was adored by Molegon Warriors. Soon after, he was forgotten. It is believed that, before the apocalypse, inside the pyramids of Cheops there was another Andromeda Baby living there. Where did you find it? Someone forgot it inside an old wagon. How much do you want for it? Enough for a seat in the spaceship. Pardon me? Welcome! What are you doing here? Tell me, little boy. Have you been a good boy? Santa Claus... with the greatest respect... I'm not a kid anymore. I've travelled a long way. And now that you've reached this point, have you already written your list? I don't... But I don't need it, Santa. I know my wish. You must write the list, and send it by post. My assistant will receive it, put the official stamp on it. Then we'll prepare the presents for Christmas time. You get it? But I'm already here, Santa Claus. You write the list, and send it by post. My assistant stamps it, and we'll bring the gifts at Christmas. Santa Claus... I want to leave with the spaceship. Make an exception. Can you please forget about bureaucracy? What the hell is up there? The only way to go to my planet. They're waiting for us! My son will be crowned new King of the Stars! We're coming! Wait! Are you crazy? Who the hell are you talking to? Listen, Santa... have you lost your mind? My wish is to go back to my planet. You come here behaving like one of those second generation Nazis, without any kindness or respect, while I am being polite. You aren't a good boy. I am the son of a Molegon warrior! I retain the nobility of my father. You need me to teach you some manners? Calm down. I have a mission to accomplish. So you better take it easy! But if you insist, I'll kick you in the face! With this bicycle, I'm going to... You know? Just a second. Bring the bicycle if you want. But look at this. You recognize this symbol, right? I don't. It looks like a Nazi symbol, or something like that. It's the symbol of the old breed. The supermen! I'll teach you some manners! You'll learn! Santa Claus! Stop, please! You're going to kill him! Hello? I can hear you, little girl! Listen! Have you been a good girl? Tell Santa your wish. Santa will make it real. Please, Santa... Please. Bring me back my Candy... That's not your wish. Santa doesn't fulfill false wishes. That's not your wish. Murderer! I'll never tell you my wish! Never! I loved you so much. I loved you with all my soul. You didn't protect him! You didn't even protect him! I've offered you every inch of my body! I hate you! I hate you. I'm tired. It's enough. I can't stand anymore. I wonder what happened to the kids in this terrible world. There's no more respect for Santa Claus. So... Santa Claus is quitting his job. Enough is enough. Listen, old man. How long has this movie been playing? Forty years, non-stop. Just a moment, kid. Give me your hand. It's you? Is that you, little boy? Don't you remember? How are you? You used to come every day. It was your favorite film. Old man... you're confusing me with someone else. I am... like in the film Superman... a visitor from another planet. You're wrong. Listen, my dear boy. I knew you would return. Your father was very sorry to the end of his days. When the war came to the city, he sent you far away, with your uncle to the countryside. He always dreamt of seeing you again one day. He loved you so much! I brought this for the baby... ...whenever she comes. Tell me I'm not dreaming. I love you so much, my Bird y. I love you too. Do you mind if I play some music? I love it! I want to buy it as well. No need to rush. I have several containers full of antiques. You'll see how much you like them!
