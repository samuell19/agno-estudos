How are the cats on the corner, the neighborhood? Now that's a trip. There's different cats now in the neighborhood. When I was growing up, I used to run the neighborhood. I was the biggest jitterbug. Now you got guys just 16, 17. They don't care about me. You know, I say, "I used to run this neighborhood." - They say, "You used to." I cannot move my mother out of the ghetto. I try and I say, "Mamma, move." "No. Mm-mm." I became pregnant, and I lost it and then again and again and again. And every time I became pregnant, I would lose it. Until I become pregnant with Teddy. He was the seventh but he was the first birth. My husband walked away. And I was left to raise a son all by myself. What I'd like to do is start from the very beginning and just kind of talk from childhood, just kinda go through my life, you know. The Mighty Mother Fuckers. And these guys were terrorists. If they couldn't get you, they would come to your house and get your family. It was a tough neighborhood. You either had to be predator or prey. It was tough going to schools. It was just tough trying to be... on the right side of things. ♪ Do you wanna party, do you wanna dance? ♪ Teddy had the bottom mouth, talked a lot of trash.

I got up and stood him on a chair because he was so little. Everybody could see him and he started singing "If I Could Write A Letter To Heaven." And he couldn't hear my voice. He stopped, and looked up at me and he said, "Sing, Mother, sing," and then he kept on singing. When he finished, the applause. You have no idea how I felt. The joy, to see my baby. Ooh! The New Testament says repent. It is time for America to repent now. The promises of the great society have been shot down on the battlefields of Vietnam.

We were doing high school together and that's when we got put out. They moved us out of school 'cause we was cutting class and singing and drinking wine and our parents didn't know that. The most important thing about any particular city that has music talent, it really just boils down to community. Philadelphia is one of those towns in which people stick together, so a lot of song writers, a lot of musicians, um, kinda work with each other and network with each other, and collaborate with each other. That's what makes Philadelphia special. This gentleman is Kenny Gamble. Over here is Leon Huff and the gentleman in the middle is Joe Tarsier. This is perhaps the happiest triumvirate you'll ever meet. The recordings these guys have made together are played on every radio and television station in the world. That famous Philadelphia sound could not have reached the level of prominence it enjoys without the mighty Blue Notes. Harold Melvin was a genius. He probably could take me and Huff, make us the Blue Notes. Yeah, yeah. ♪ If you don't know me by now ♪ Harold Melvin was the person who found Teddy. Huff called me up and said, "Man, you gotta hear this guy." Teddy's voice rang out over all the background. It just stuck out. Tried him on a song, "I Miss You." And um... I said, "Gamble, this guy, he sounds great," you know. I was really high on him. Really excited about him. "I Miss You", that was our first record and we got in the studio and started like doing... You know. "That's it! That's it!" ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Oh, oh ♪ - ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ - ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ I miss you, baby ♪ Not only was he good-looking but he had a presence and uh... and uh... he had a special voice. ♪ Ah ♪ ♪ 'Cause ever since the day you left ♪ ♪ I don't know what to do with myself ♪ ♪ Oh, I wish for your return ♪ - ♪ And, oh, how I yearn ♪ - ♪ How I yearn ♪ - ♪ 'Cause I ♪ - ♪ Oh, I ♪ ♪ Oh, I ♪ That was our first tune. He came out with, "Ladies and gentlemen, 'I Miss You' from Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes," and everybody was like, "What the hell is going on?" It's the Blue Notes. But Harold, he put his name on the front, without us knowing it. With guest stars Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes. Harold told Gamble and Huff it was all right with the guys. You know, he lied to Gamble. Harold wanted to have his identity a bit more because Teddy was so dominating that people thought that he was the leader of the group and Harold was the leader of the group. We said let's rename it Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes. But at that particular time we were so happy to be out there, we didn't know later on down the line it was gonna bite us in the butt. I was on the radio in Washington DC when I first heard Teddy and played his music. Many people thought those vocals belonged to Harold when they in fact were Teddy. Harold did sing some leads but the big hits belonged to Teddy, so I didn't know if Teddy was Harold Melvin or Harold Melvin was Teddy. I just thought that Harold Melvin was the lead of this band. I couldn't piece together that it wasn't Harold Melvin singing those songs, that it was Teddy Pendergrass. Harold's success came from the mouth of Teddy Pendergrass. We got hits after hits after hits. You know, and to this day, there ain't too many groups can mess with us. Gamble was the lyric writer, basically, and I played the keyboard, and we'll be at Gamble's office where that upright was. You know, two guys in a little room, and recording, and then the whole world is singing your song. ♪ Don't leave me this way ♪ ♪ I can't survive, can't stay alive ♪ ♪ Without your love ♪ It was like lightning struck.

Teddy was really making the money for the group. It was just Harold just messing everything up. Being greedy. We were playing at Total Experience in Los Angeles and, um, a royalty check had come in and Harold had cashed it. Bernie, Teddy and Larry were staying in motels, and Teddy walked to the Beverly Wilshire, where Harold was staying in a suite. And Harold said, "I don't think I got it. I'm a little low on cash but I'll go upstairs and check it out." And he saw these... looked like thousands of dollars. He had a stack of money on the bed, I mean stacks of what they have in the banks, you know, with the little wraps on them. Harold gave him 200 and told him not to tell us. ♪ Wake up, everybody ♪ ♪ No more sleeping in bed ♪ I had to remind myself that that was a Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes song. Because it's really a Teddy song. ♪ What it used to be ♪ ♪ There is so much hatred, war and poverty ♪ If it were Teddy Pendergrass and the Blue Notes, that would've made a difference, but you can't keep a good man down. ♪ Wake up, everybody ♪ We called it "Break Up, Everybody." Because Teddy left Harold. The Blue Notes left Harold. And Teddy went on his own. The Blue Notes went on their own. Harold started up another group. Teddy was preparing to leave Harold and Harold had made some serious threats about what would happen to Teddy if he did so. His life! Threatening his life. Harold came to me and said that he wanted to stay with the company but he didn't want Teddy to be there. I said we can't do that. Business is business. - Right. - You know, and um... I think we made a great decision. Harold was very angry and didn't wish Teddy well when he went on his own, said that he would fall on his face. But then once I heard "I Don't Love You Anymore," that's it, gone. ♪ I don't love you anymore ♪ ♪ It's just that simple ♪ ♪ No, no, no, not like before ♪ ♪ Such a shame, dirty shame, yeah ♪ You quit singing for a while. How come? Yes, um... we recorded a record once and um... heard no more from the producer or the record and we kinda just.. - That happens, though. - But I was a kid. Sixteen years old, it meant a lot to me, you know. - I stopped singing and-- - Completely? Yeah, for a while. I said, "I'm gonna play drums and beat my troubles away." You played drums for other people? Yeah. I played drums for Harold before I sang with him. Harold Melvin? I bet you don't play drums for him after this. I'm gonna get him to play drums for me. No! Oh, Harold, you got a big one coming. That's funny. Who plays drums for you now? A gentleman named James Carter and I really wouldn't want his job, because I am hard on him, yeah. I was 21 years old, you know, at the time, and I probably was a little tiny bit more handsome than I am now, not much more. When I met Teddy, he said, "Good, you're gonna be all right. They say drummers with gaps in their teeth can play." Taaz Lang was the manager. So one day I got a call saying we need to put a band together. Teddy knew that I was a band leader at the Uptown and Teddy asked me to take over the band, and I did, and that's how it got started. ♪ Ooh ooh ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh ooh ooh ♪ I was walking along 52nd Street trying to get a gig. - Trying to get... - She will do anything. - She will sing. - Yes. And he said, "Do you know me?" And I said, "No." And he said, "I'm Teddy Pendergrass, you know. I left Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes and I'm gonna be big," and I was like, "Yeah. OK." In the audition he says, "What's going on with you?" I said, "Those guys got the job, they're great musicians." He says, "No." He said, "You played what was on the paper. You can have the job." I remember just sitting there and, I mean, I'm the white boy, I'm the youngest, in a flannel shirt and jeans and hiking boots. Everybody else is looking Italian. I just really... We commune through the playing because I kinda understood, you know, the music. One night Teddy saw us performing and Taaz, his manager, called the studio, and asked if we would dance with him. We didn't know who he was. "Who is he?" But what clicked for us was they said, "Well, he's opening at Carnegie Hall," and we thought, "Carnegie Hall? Yes, we'll dance, and we can go to Carnegie Hall." ♪ Ooh ooh ooh ♪ Taaz Lang, she said, "Hey, you need to stay here, it's gonna be good." Ted loved Taaz. He always made it very clear how important that she was. One of the most important relationships in his life is how he had put it to me. I knew Taaz pretty good. She had a beauty shop, like, talkative, make-it-happen kinda lady, you know what I mean? Is that a shop we rehearsed at? It was a show we rehearsed in, yeah. She was a good girl but she was firm. - She was very firm. - Oh, extremely. We had left by bus so Taaz saw us off and we went on Thursday evening. And Teddy had rode with us that time. Was strange that he was on the bus with us. And soon as he got into town, he went to make a phone call, and he was informed that Taaz Lang had been shot. Killed, murdered. Henry Evans, Teddy's road manager, called Teddy and said that Taaz was dead. And I was like... the look that I got from both of them, I was like, "This is not right." It's uh... filled with some kind of regret. I'm looking at somebody that's full of relieved, like... The hits come faster on the "Sonny Hopson Show!" I said OK. She had been shot. She was killed. There was a lot of thug life happening, you know, in the record industry at that time. He intimidated me, you know. Sometimes I would be scared, excuse the term, shitless, in the studio. Where you have money, you have mobsters usually. You knew you had to be a part of things because you're doing a show but you didn't wanna get 9too friendly with anybody like that. Taaz started making threats. She could ruin his career. That's a big threat for an entertainer. "I can ruin your career, I can change your whole life." Who killed Taaz? It was the Black Mafia, just I don't know who. Just don't know who. Never found out who did it. Their main business was drugs and the business was violent. You can't let anybody steal from you. If you do, they had to pay a price, either break their legs or take their life. - The story never came out. - Never came out. It's one of those unsolved mysteries. Like it's been said those who say don't know and those who know don't say. One of those kinda deals. Didn't surprise me about why they would kill her because she had total control over Teddy Pendergrass and I had heard the rumors that she had too much. ♪ This one's for you ♪ I was blessed to play at her funeral, and Cecil Du Valle played organ. I played piano and Teddy sang "This One's For You." And you could tell the emotions that Teddy put into that song for Taaz. Wow, it was very sad playing that song. ♪ That I'm the one who cries ♪ ♪ And I ♪ Jesse Jackson preached the eulogy. ♪ And I'll fight so hard ♪ ♪ To hide my tears 'cause... ♪ ♪ This one is for you ♪ I was fairly successful as a young manager who got a reputation of being different, and Alice was one of the artists I managed so I got on a plane, I went to Philadelphia to see Teddy Pendergrass. I didn't realize till I got to the show that it was the lead singer of Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, who happened to be one of my favorite groups in the world. Would you do me a very big favor, please? Give a round of applause to the Teddy Bear Dancers! But I hated the show. Dancers. He was dressed in a cape. I didn't like it at all. But I go backstage, all the Jewish managers in the business are at the backstage door. I didn't wait. I just left. So I went back down to Philadelphia. He lived in a penthouse. This gorgeous lady in lingerie opened the doors, like a set of a movie. And I come in and then Teddy walks in the room. And in person, Teddy is overwhelmingly handsome. Overwhelmingly sexual. Overwhelmingly magnetic and remarkable. I had no idea what to say. So I came up with the most outrageous thing I could possibly think of. "You have no way to tell which one of us Jews is telling you the truth. It's like a foreign lang... And the guys you had there? They're all the best at lying. And I happen to be one of them. The one thing you probably know how to do is get high. And I know how to do that too. You probably get higher than you should. There'll be times when you have money in your pocket and someone may take it from you. I get as high as you but I keep it together, and I make sure I have the cash so when you wake up..." And he just looked at me like, "What?" I said, "Meet me somewhere, bring your best drugs, your best women, whatever you want, and we'll see who goes down first." ♪ Come on and get down ♪ ♪ Down, down, down, down, down ♪ And three days later, Teddy collapsed. I managed him the rest of his career. So we first sat down, I told him, "By the way, the show goes and you gotta get rid of the dancers." Where I come from, we say dance the ass off. We were fired! So that was how he met Karen. They told Teddy, "You don't need dancers. You're a star, you can do this." Teddy said, "Now you don't work for me, will you go out with me?" And that's how we started dating. We went to our first show. Teddy Pendergrass! - Thank you! And now the show's over I found the promoter in the bathroom. I said, "Hi, I'm Shep, I'm the new manager." He said, "We didn't bring any cash." I said, "What do you mean? Do you have a check book?" "We'll send it to him." "You'll do what?" And finally got a little crazy and he ended up giving me his ring. He said, "Tell Teddy to keep the ring till he gets the check." I went into Teddy's dressing room and I said, "What the fuck is going on?" So, anyway, I left and I started talking to friends who knew that world. Um, and they explained to me that this thing that I had heard somewhere in the back of my head but never really thought about, which was the Chitlin' Circuit and it was black promoters, black record companies, getting black artists to play their venues basically for free 'cause they thought they had to to promote their records. They had to work for something. You know, and sometimes they would work for almost nothing. I just didn't want to be a part of it. So that night I said to Teddy, you know, "Fuck 'em." Um... "We're going to play for white promoters. You're gonna get paid and let 'em go abuse somebody else." And he said, "Listen, I didn't tell you this before." "What's that?" He said, "My last manager was shot to death." Uh... So the table soon turned at that moment where I had to really think, and I said, "Fuck 'em. You're in, I'm in." He said, "I'll take the ride with you. Let's do it." Can we have a warm welcome for Mr. Teddy Pendergrass! The first show we did was at the Roxy in LA. White promoters. We got death threats. FBI protected us. We got security from them. But we got through it and sort of opened the floodgates and at least at the live level, the concept of Chitlin' Circuit was gotten rid of. For me that's the most important thing to get out about Teddy. He risked his life to make it easier for Afro American artists after him. And that's big. I'll tell you a secret. No offense to our white brothers and sisters but the hotel said, "I've never seen so many niggers in my life!" But I'm glad we all came down. It's nice to see that we can all sit together. Some of you in the front and some of us in the front there. We don't ride the back of the bus no more. We went to California to see them perform. - What was the place? - Roxy. Roxy. Yeah. - We knew it then, we said, wow. - Yeah. This was not the usual. Mm-hm. You know what was amazing too, Gamble? Teddy didn't even open his mouth yet and the females just went crazy. I thought, "Wait a second. Let's just do shows for women only." There was a full-page ad with a teddy bear and an invitation. We had a recorded message from Teddy with a phone number and you called it and he invited them to it. This is Teddy Pendergrass. Join me, won't you? Now that I got 'em in the hall, how do I really get 'em crazy? We came up with chocolate teddy bear lollipops that we gave out to the audience so the girls could lick it and bite it and... We sold out... - In a second. There has been screaming at the Greek Theatre. People think they've found a new king, a successor to Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley.

And the women were just... I thought they were nuts. - Oh! - What appeals about him? His body. His body. Mm-mm-mm! They loved Teddy. They loved Teddy. They showed him any way they could. Rush the stage. Throw panties on the stage. He would meet a woman and within 11 seconds, he could get it to a point with her that if I had met her I'd have to go out a couple of times, I'd have to meet her parents. I'd have to go through all this just to get to the point where he was in 11 seconds. It wasn't even fair. Who's the one in the shows that's screaming and hollering? It's the females. So you gotta write for them. - And that's what we did. - And that's what we did. May I just list the first four songs on the album? "Come Go With Me." "Close the Door."

I just like the way he just sings it. He sings it good and I like the way he's just altogether, you know. This is billed as a "for women only" concert. That doesn't mean anything. Here's my lady right here. I want to see him just as bad as she does. The guys that did come to the show, he would say to 'em, "I'm not here to take your woman, I'm just starting them up for you." "I'm getting them ready for you." "When I get finished I'm going on the bus.

I don't like to do that. He was a charismatic, strong, emoting performer when he was center stage, and the women just went ga-ga over him. They went crazy for him. Black and white. Black and white. We'll sing whatever comes to your mind. Would you say that again in the microphone? This lady came backstage and I walk out the door and she has this knife and she pulls it out of her pocket. She says, "If I can't have you, nobody can." Yeah, and she lunged at me with this... I mean... This was a black lady and it was a black knife. - That long, huh? I seen some things that my dog wouldn't bark at. We had girls pull knives, guns. We had girls buy maids' uniforms. They'd be waiting for him in the suite. If you love a man like that you know that part of the real estate is a lot of other homes. That he is the property owner of many residences. I would not go on the road. He would even call me and say, "I want you to come out," and I would not go. I'm like, "Don't send for me." I would not go on the road. I didn't want to be a part of it. When Ted came into a room, you knew it. It was like a hurricane literally walked in. Just adorable. I loved the way he smelled. I loved the way he laughed and I loved the way his face would light up when he saw me. It felt great. It felt great, made me feel special. Teddy rode past me in a blue Rolls-Royce. He called me to his car and I got nervous, I ran from him. I thought he was a pimp. A pimp. My sister showed me an album. I said, "That's the man who stopped me." She said, "That's Teddy Pendergrass, stupid." I said, "I ran from him." So we'd both kiss the album. But he was very handsome, I must say that.

There was just a whole spectrum of people wrapped up in that one person. He talked about not knowing his father and that troubled him. And when he met his father, he didn't like how his father handled him with his mom. I promised him, before I leave this world, I'm gonna let you see your dad. I'm gonna look him up and I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna let you see your father, and I did just that, when he was 11 years old. And we dressed to kill that day, wow. And I turned to Teddy and I said, "This is your father." And he looked up at him and he dropped his head real quick and I said, "Honey, look at your father. Make sure when you see him again, you will know who he is." Me and Teddy, we went on a trolley and started back for home. The next time we saw him, he was in his coffin. ♪ I give myself away ♪ ♪ Oh-oh-oh-oh ♪ ♪ I give myself away ♪ ♪ So you can use me ♪ He always said that because his father wasn't in his life, he always wanted to be in our lives. No matter what. And at times he could be selfish or he felt like it was all him, that he had to always do everything. Whereas though that probably came from the fact that he didn't have anybody to lean on growing up. So it made him strong but it also made him feel like he was all he had. He just wanted to protect us from the world. I guess he lived and he saw it all and he just didn't want us to go through half of the things that he went through. Get funky for me one time! I liked him most of the time but he was a guy that if he made you love him, you loved him. If he made you mad... He made you mad! Teddy had a tremendous ego. He also had a tremendous talent and I was trying to imagine what it would have been like to be thrust into the limelight, into being a star at the pace that it happened for him. A complicated guy. A complicated man. A weird combination of ego and vulnerability at the same time. And I do think a lot of those characteristics helped him put those songs over. ♪ Life is a song worth singing ♪ ♪ Why don't you sing it? ♪ ♪ Life is a song worth singing ♪ ♪ Why don't you sing it? ♪ Five platinum albums in a row! - That's some kind of record. - Yes, thank you.

Philly International I believe was 313. So all Broad Street knew when Teddy Pendergrass was in proximity because the sound of shrieking women shouldn't be that loud at 12 p.m. in the afternoon. The second you start hearing the shrieks it's like... "Yeah, Teddy Pendergrass is over." It was chaos and he ate it up. Teddy Pendergrass was Philadelphia's king. Its prince. He was a sleek-looking guy. Brown brother. Nice hair. Nice features. And dressing sharp. When you ride with Teddy it was an adventure 'cause he would have his drink here, his pistol here. And whatever other paraphernalia he had. And I'm hanging on and he'd say, "What's wrong, Jesse, you scared?" Goddamn right. The only thing I ever worried about with Ted is the police gave him such a hard time in Philadelphia that I never knew when something might happen. Whenever they saw his car, they were right behind us and they were following him and just looking for an opportunity. I lived in Philadelphia from '65 to '70. Some tough years down there for relations between the races. There was some tense moments in North Philadelphia. I got to know the neighborhood rather well. I've got a couple of scars that I can show you from some of those days. It was rough. Somebody dropped a dime. And because of the police siren, everybody ran. Well, then Teddy ran too. He was innocent, he didn't do what the police said he did. Somebody was robbed or something and he fit the profile and he was locked up. When we had the hearing, Teddy told the story. The judge said, "But you shouldn't have run," so they took him to the Youth Study Center. He called me. "Mom, come and get me." He stayed there five months, I think it was. ♪ Had my dream so near ♪ ♪ I could reach out and touch it ♪ ♪ I could touch it ♪ - ♪ And I lost it ♪ - ♪ And I lost it ♪ ♪ And I lost it ♪ The police would come by the house, and, of course, it escalated and next thing you know, they're taking him off in handcuffs. The police harassed him a lot. And Teddy didn't take any stuff from anybody and if he felt he was right, he was gonna stand up for himself. And here is this big black man with that Rolls-Royce. Millionaire. So the police felt like that's a target. ♪ Whoever you are, be a star ♪ ♪ In Celebrity Jeans ♪ Be free, be someone special with Teddy Pendergrass Celebrity Body Jeans. - You got them Teddy jeans? ♪ Whoever you are, be a star ♪ We were ready and we had all these elements and we had a clear path to stardom.

My market is very loyal to me and I'm very, very grateful to that and I would never ever leave but what I wanna do is expose my way of doing things to other marketplaces and give them a chance to say whether they like it or not. He was positioned to be really a major artist, crossover artist, because he had that talent, and he had the music behind him and he had the right management team. His job was to become, at least I felt, and I think he felt the same, to become the black Elvis. He was about to go worldwide and he would have been a total phenomenon. You know, in that range of Prince or Michael Jackson, whatever, he was getting ready to take it to another level.

We were on the way but we still didn't cross over yet. It was, it was trying to. We were just finding the right couple of songs. Teddy had asked me to do an arrangement on "Lady." And it made a lot of sense to do that because Teddy's voice would have brought in the black audience. But the choice of song would have brought in the white audience. And the combination of the two would have been a hit. - ♪ Lady ♪ ♪ I'm your knight in shining armor ♪ ♪ And I love you ♪ ♪ You have come into my life ♪ ♪ And ♪ ♪ Made me whole ♪ ♪ And for ever ♪ ♪ Let me wake to see you ♪ ♪ Each, each and every morning ♪ ♪ Let me hear you whisper softly ♪ ♪ In my ear ♪ ♪ In my eyes ♪ ♪ But in my eyes ♪ ♪ I see no one else but you ♪ ♪ There's no other ♪ ♪ Love like our love ♪ ♪ Oh yes, oh yes ♪ ♪ I'll always want you near me ♪ ♪ I've waited for you ♪ ♪ For so long ♪ ♪ Oh-oh ♪ ♪ Lady ♪ ♪ Lady ♪ ♪ Lady ♪ ♪ You see, your love ♪ ♪ Your love is the only love that I'll ever need ♪ ♪ And right here ♪ ♪ Right here beside me ♪ ♪ Oh, that's where ♪ ♪ That's where I want you to be for ever and ever ♪ ♪ 'Cause my love ♪ ♪ Oh, my love ♪ ♪ There's something I want you to know ♪ ♪ Something I've just got to let you know ♪ ♪ That you're the love of my life ♪ We had a little ritual that we would go to the basketball game to see Julius. Watch the game and sometimes go out afterwards. And I said, "Let's get out of here," let's stop at this little club we knew. While I was sitting in the lobby, I saw this person, and everything she had on was too revealing. I saw Teddy again at a club, the Warwick Hotel at 17th and Locust. He was with this girl named Yvette and one of Teddy's friends, Brinkley. And he asked me did I want a drink. No, I didn't feel any threat from any other woman. Are you kidding me? Teddy treated me like a princess. So he says, "Well, I'm gonna take one lady home and then take the other lady to my house." Um, he was driving kind of fast and so I said to him slow down. Slow down. And so he slowed down. He uh... got me home, walked me to the door, kissed me good night and I said, "Make sure you call me when you get home." I was wondering why he didn't drop me off first 'cause I only lived about three, four blocks from the club. But I just went along for the ride. So on our way back, the car started going really, really fast. Everything got completely quiet. I didn't know how bad the car was damaged. All I know we both were alive and I was thanking God for that. And out of nowhere, a man came up to the car. Approximately 1:30 in the morning Engine 19, Ladder 8, Battalion 9 and Medic 16 were dispatched to Lincoln Drive. Lincoln Drive is a notorious section of highway where there's a lot of accidents. Slick conditions, a lot of switchbacks. Many people drive too quickly so there's frequently accidents; sometimes very bad accidents. We arrive on scene and we have a Rolls-Royce into a couple of trees. The passenger, Tenika Watson, seemed uninjured. The driver had been thrown into the back seat. We put him on a spine board and removed him from the car. They got us out of it and I was thinking maybe I can get away from here but when I got out Teddy whispered, he said, "Don't leave me, don't let them hurt me." And I was like, "Who is they?" It was like a fear came over him. I don't know why he said it, but it kind of made me nervous too, like, "Who wants to hurt you?" Everybody knew who he was. I intubated him myself to make sure that his airway was established safely without damaging that wonderful voice. My mother called me. What they had heard on the news was that there was a girl in the car with Ted and everybody thought it was me. You know, you're just like in shock for a moment and, you know, you just have to sit still, say, "What do I do?" I get out of the cab and go through the hospital revolving door and the doctors are already doing a press conference. We don't know the answer because only time will tell us. Only time will tell the neurosurgeon. He has some limitation of movement in his arms. He is able to move parts of his arms. We can't define it any more than that because it's uh... - It's not stable at the moment. - Not his hands? He broke his neck. If you think of the spinal column as a tube, if you tear it and then shift it, whatever's running through the middle gets squished. Once a certain level of damage has happened to the spine and it's unrecoverable... I got off the elevator and Karen and the doctor and Mrs. Pendergrass were there. And, um, they took me in a room, they said, "Listen, um, Teddy's not gonna walk again. We're going in the room now to tell him." And I... Whoa. I went in. Teddy was lying on a table. Strapped down. He was crying a lot, he was very upset. And I almost fainted there in the room. I mean, I had to... I had to sit down on the floor because it just... You don't think it will ever happen until reality sets in and just seeing him that way, I was pretty woozy. His eyes were closed and it was the weirdest thing. He heard us come in and sort of opened his eyes and... The doctor said, "Can you hear us? If you can, blink once." And he blinked. And, um, we told him that he would never walk again, and that he had to start his rehabilitation, but he was gonna live, and we were gonna get through this with him. And that was rough. It was the toughest moment I've... Yeah. That was tough. I pulled myself together and you couldn't move him because he was pinned in and you couldn't get... So the back of his head, I just ran my finger under his hair like that. And that was satisfaction to him. We were doing a show in Charlotte and I went to bed early so I could get up. We had to be at the airport six o'clock in the morning and four o'clock in the morning the phone rang. They said, "Turn on the radio, turn on the radio." So I turned on the radio and then that's how we heard what had happened. They said Teddy Pendergrass was in a very bad accident, was paralyzed from the waist down. It was like, you got to be joking, you know. - I couldn't believe it. - Unbelievable. You know, it's like, so I um... I called Henry and said, "Teddy was in a car accident?" He said, "Yeah, we're gonna leave later because I don't know how..." None of us knew it was that bad. - That serious. - None of us knew it. And he called back later and said we're not going anywhere. - And I was like, wow. - We never went anywhere again. ♪ But those days are gone ♪ ♪ Don't leave me ♪ ♪ Here alone ♪ ♪ So I'm standing here, standing here ♪ ♪ All by myself ♪ ♪ Don't wanna be ♪ ♪ All by myself anymore ♪ He had everything he wanted.

I never saw anyone, especially black people, this devastated. They weren't going to school. Oh, God, we were next door to Philly International. Everybody was devastated. - We were in Jamaica. - We were in Jamaica. Writing songs for him for his next album. Yeah. That was a sad day. All day, the talk on the street was about Teddy. I really liked him. I thought he was really a good singer and a good man. Really sorry. I just hope he sings again, that's all. I'm praying for him a lot and I hope for a speedy recovery because he is my man. Steady Teddy. He had been drinking but he wasn't intoxicated. No. I would not have allowed him to drive me in his car if he had been drunk. They didn't find anything in his system. They didn't say he had drugs in him. I didn't. He had had trouble with that car ever since he bought it. It had no brakes. A lot of people believed that this accident was a setup to get rid of him. I think the car was sabotaged, I think it was. Because of other cars that he had. I mean, every car that you have, something's gonna happen to the car? Really? He pulled his Corvette out one day and the brake lines were cut. He had a Mercedes, 450 SL, brake lines were cut. A friend said it was an organization that wanted to kidnap him for ransom so all types of things were happening. He didn't know who his friends were or who his enemies were. I don't put anything past show business during that time in Philadelphia. ♪ He's my man ♪ He lived a big life and he had really used up most of his funds. - More? - ♪ Girls, let me turn you on ♪ ♪ To the big Bull buzz ♪ ♪ One sip will make you ♪ It's got more taste than beer ♪ We had a very large beer company that sponsored Teddy. I told them what happened to Teddy and we were gonna have to cancel and would they put together an endowment for the kids, and they said, "Yes, we'll definitely do something. We'll do some kind of a fund, some kind of charitable donation." Then I woke up in the morning and the newspaper said the girl in the car was a guy. And I knew I'd never hear from the beer company again! There was a police lady and she said that she had arrested me before. And she knew my past, that's how I got into the paper. Everybody believed it was a woman. She was striking. I wouldn't dispute how impressive she looked. And my assumption was, knowing Teddy, that he was driving with her, put his hand down between her legs, felt the penis and had the accident. I started hormones when I came to Philadelphia. And five years after I started hormones I had my surgery. That was 1977. I'm a woman. I've been a woman, completely a woman, for 40 years now. So my whole theory went right out the window. ♪ I used to have lots of money ♪ ♪ I had 'em in big old stacks ♪ We needed to generate money for his family.

If it had been a little higher, he would not have been able to breathe and would have been tracheotomy and respirator dependent. He would just be quiet and keep to himself, you know? He had a sad look on his face and people had to feed him and he was just sitting there. He was paralyzed forever and I didn't want him to be like that. I wanted it to be like the old times. He said if I want to commit suicide, I couldn't. And I realized he was correct. I didn't think about it until after. He couldn't. He couldn't. He was very depressed. He had sleeping pills to take to sleep at night, and he would ask me to give him all the sleeping pills and I was like, "No. No way." You know, we cried, and we boo-hooed, and I tried to read the Bible and make sense of all this, and he kept saying, "I will never be able to walk again." And I said, "But you're alive." ♪ Is this my beginning? ♪ ♪ Or is this the end? ♪ ♪ When will I see you again? ♪ ♪ When will I see you again? ♪ ♪ Sweet, sweet love ♪ ♪ When will I see you again? ♪ Dr. Gottlieb, God thank you. Dr. Gottlieb got in touch with him and told him, "No, Teddy, don't give up." I have a visceral reaction when I hear things like that. My heart breaks and it did for him because I knew where he came from and where he was going to end up. To be honest with you, it was just a few years after my accident. I knew what he was going through. But I was also in the depths of my depression, and at the deepest level, saving his life felt like saving my own. And an average therapist who had these feelings would not treat that patient. Probably shouldn't have. But this was different. There were no quadriplegic therapists. I was the only one around. He finally decided that he was gonna to take his life. But I said to him, "Teddy," I said, "if you're going to do this, you have a moral obligation to talk with your mother, Karen and your son about this decision." And he agreed. They all came in. We had a family session. They all cried. They all understandably tried to talk him out of it. They begged him, especially his poor son. Um... And he didn't cry in that session. Um, which is more troubling. So at the end of the session Teddy says, "I probably won't see you again." And I heard that word. "Probably." And I said, "Teddy," I said, "Get your ass back in here." So he came in. I said, "What do you mean, probably?" And that's when I made the proposal to him. I said, "We're gonna stage a funeral for you so you'll know what it's like for them." Little Teddy, Mom, myself and Teddy had to invite all of the people we felt, you know, were our closest friends, family, whoever. And he put a sheet over Teddy. And he said, "OK, you're dead." And he said, "You can't say anything," and one by one we had to walk up and express to Teddy what we felt about him taking... about him being dead. Our job was to tell him... how we feel about him and what life would be like without him. I remember a lot of people being mad, angry, hurt, because everybody felt that he had so much to live for. And they took that sheet off of his face. And Teddy sat up in that chair and said, "I don't wanna die." He said, "I want to live." I don't know what that did to him but death was not even a question after that. He was determined to be able to sing. Everybody with whom he consulted except for me, told him it was impossible. A couple of months after it happened, I tried singing. I was scared to death. And I remember it was in the afternoon, there was a coffee commercial. And I said, "You know, there's... Doggone it, you know? It's a possibility, yeah. You know, if given the opportunity, yeah, we can do this." I thought it was unlikely that he was going to be able to sing fully the same way that he had before. But that we would get him singing again and then he would have to decide whether that was a good enough sound to go back into the studio and to go out in public. So the next thing I did was get a hold of all the video tapes that I could to study his voice and his technique and find out what we were trying to restore. ♪ Taking the bumps and the bruises and all the things ♪ ♪ Of a two-time loser ♪ ♪ Trying to hold on, faith is gone ♪ ♪ It's just another sad song ♪ It's not a coincidence that Teddy Pendergrass's accident and the slow, quiet fade-out of Philly International happened at the same time.

And there was a lot of fighting back and forth. With the accident and not being able to secure another deal with CBS Records, time had run out. For everybody. Your record company left, they walked away, right? So long, you can't do it for us anymore, goodbye. That must have hurt. Tremendously. Tremendously.

They were unsure about going forward with Teddy Pendergrass. I was not really aware of how serious Teddy's problems were. I had heard the rumors. I asked Shep, "Shep, what is the truth?" He told me what the truth is. I said, "I am in." Teddy had some residual arm fluxion. He was able to use his biceps. So we created for him a belt-like apparatus that went around his waist so when he needed more support for his singing voice, he flexed his arms and everything around his abdomen and back tightened and he was able to sing again. This is his first live television interview since the car he was driving crashed 26 months ago. He was left paralyzed. Teddy got his voice back and he regained some strength. I have accomplished something that um... was at first unsure that I'd be able to do. People would say, "Oh, the guy's dead, he's gone. He won't be back. That's it for him. Wash-out. He's gone." And I set out to prove that nobody will determine when I'm done but me. I went back to Bob Krasnow and I said I think we can do an album. This album is a product of two years of thinking. I've received a lot of love and I hope to give that love back through my music. ♪ I'm a tried and true romantic ♪ My focus was I have millions of women who love Teddy, who know about the tragedy.

One song in the middle of Live Aid and it's goose-bump moment for everybody. He was so scared and everybody, we were so reassuring of him. "Dad, you can do it and we're so happy for you. You can do it, we love you." We were like a mini entourage, mini family entourage. We would get behind and get beside him and went out and a number of artists and other entertainers were excited to see him, see him out. You know, he always had a certain standard, and he wanted to continue that standard so of course he was nervous. How would people receive him in the wheelchair? Oh, he was nervous, he was... nervous. I was nervous so I can't imagine what he was feeling but because he was our friend, if he thought he was ready then we thought he was ready. Teddy went out at the bottom of the ramp and he was looking really slick. But I could see something was wrong. I went over to him and he said, "I don't think I can do this. I can't pull this off. I don't think I have the power to pull it off." I said, "Well, we're here, we've gotta do it." And he said, "I don't know." I said, "Teddy, I'm wheeling you out there. You don't have to sing but you're gonna be there." Put your hands together and give a big round of applause to Mr. Teddy Pendergrass! When he rolled himself out, I remember it was almost like choreographed, we kind of backed away from him. And it was such a long applause. More applause than I've ever heard in my life. Oh, listen, Ashford, thank you so much. When he rolled out on that stage, everybody just cried. We just lost it but it was like a happy time. We were so proud of him.
