[gong banging] [music playing] REPORTER [ON TV]: Oh, another cramp. That's the second caught by the Oxford stroke, Saturday Keith. And if nothing else happens in this race, that's a record anyway. Still, they're picking up the stroke very well. But Cambridge are rowing well together and not a bit tired. I'd say they're at least three legs ahea-- yes, three lengths at least as they shoot the bridge. Oxford have recovered, and now Keith is picking up the stroke. He must be striking-- MAN: Oh, stop fiddling with him too. REPORTER [ON TV]: Yes, a good 32. But I'm afraid that they'll never recover from their setbacks. They just can't close that gap. This has been quite a fast race. I doubt if any records have been broken. What do you say George? GEORGE [ON TV]: Oh, about two minutes earlier. [cheering] REPORTER [ON TV]: Well, this race was even until Haman Smith. But then Keith, the Oxford stroke caught his first cramp. They lost quite a bit. But after this second disaster, they have no chance. [laughter] Very unlucky. Keith is trying to pick up the stroke again, but they can't make any impression. [chatter] Saturday Keith is the youngest member of a famous rowing family and is known as the undergraduate poet. His new book-- Where is Aviron Shakespeare, by the way? REPORTER [TV]: --has just been published. But I think he'll need more pull and poetry to push past-- [chatter] [music playing] [chatter] Saturday. Voila. [music playing] A success, ay? How solid. Ke-- Oh, light as feathers from an angels wings. Sweet as true love. April's Southern spring. At your creation, genius stood at hand. Saturday, you missed yourself catching two crabs on television, My dear, Matthew, this morning I was inspired. I invented a new dish, Crabalaki. First catch your crab. Oh, may I look? Going to read all about the race. Heaven's no. Benbow, you know the critic was going to review [inaudible] today, my agent told me. Huh, here it is. What's the matter? He says my poetry is grim and grimy. Th-- that it's out of date and ought to be out of print. That meter lips hazard had fallen arches. Professor Benbow is a very nice gentleman, sir. He likes the [inaudible]. He's here tonight. Where? Over there. Sir. Professor Benbow. I am Saturday Keith. I've had the pleasure of seeing you earlier this afternoon, Mr. Keith. A very illuminating experience. Have you read this? Certainly, I wrote it. Words fail me, sir. It was obviously the moment I read your book, sir. However, we all have value of bad business. The great thing is to get rid of it as early as possible. Perhaps you would be so good as to tell me how you dare criticize a subject about which you obviously know nothing. Would you suggest that a priest from long experience is unable to distinguish between good and evil? I have lived among poets and poetry all my life, sir. And as a result, I'm asked to give an honest opinion as to whether a work is good or bad. And my work is bad? Unfortunately not, merely indifferent. However, let us leave this distasteful subject. Would you care to join me in a glass of wine? I'm not one to bear malice, sir, but I would not join my worst enemy in a 1922 Burgundy. A very good year, sir. A very indifferent year. '23 or '26, possibly, but not 1922. How dare you criticize my choice of wine, sir? How dare you criticize my choice of words. [screams] Get out or I'll have you thrown out. I have also been slandered in the press by a half-witted windbag. [laughter] This-- this is the last time I shall stand amongst you. [cheering] Tomorrow, I go away to shoot big game. Oh, to thee ply of Jersey. Short horn or other ilk, who from your bovine bounty for his pure streams of unpremeditated milk. Oh, from the bull, isn't it? [mooing] Hi. [whistles] Hi. [music playing] MAN: I told you we were having a repeat tonight. What do you think this place is? The Ritz? Go and do as you're told. What do you think you get paid for? Go on and get on with it. And put some more beans in that [inaudible].. Hello, sir. Where is everybody? What? I said, where is everybody? Uh. What do you want? We don't encourage hikers. Obviously. I want a Romansome lunch. A bit late for lunch, aren't you? But not too late for a room. You can have 23. Sign the register. Not much trade, ay? No. Pity. Must have been quite a decent pub. Turn to the left to the top of the stairs. Look where our Bonnie face expensive stands to welcome cheerful guests with open hand. Dryden. Two soups. She wants it clear. [inaudible]. Off. Hare. Off. That's last week's. Well, what can I eat then? Tickle clear roast beef. Boiled or mashed greens. What is the soup? Brown. Thick or clear. Clear. Bring me a pint of it. Right. I see there, there's Keith, Saturday Keith, a purge writer. There. I wonder what he's up to now that he's come down from Oxford. - Wendy. He looks quite old. Hmm. He went up after the war. He was in the RAF. Expect he wishes he were back. I generally wish I were back in the army. Don't be absurd, Quentin. Just a minute. Look at this. When was your beer engine cleaned last? If you got any complaints, care to let them directly to my husband. I'd be delighted. Hmm, sir. Now, that's a really nice man. Got some stuffing in him. Oh, bags of it. Writes poetry. Frank. Well? I see above the front door that you are one, Frank Lott, licensed to provide accommodation, food and drink for travelers. That's right. I've seen the accommodation, it's unbearable. I've tasted the soup, it's unbeatable. I've sipped at the beer, it's undrinkable. There's another pub in the village of your serve particular. Yes, I am particular. The charge for lunch is five shilling. I haven't had any lunch. You've had the soup. On the contrary, you seem to have shared it. Mr. Keith, come over and sit at our table. Do sit down. Even if the food is intolerable, one can always choose one's company. Thank you. I'm Lady Mercy Cotton. This is my son, Quentin. - How'd you do? How'd you do? He knows you of course, but of course, you don't know him. Now, look here, I don't want people like you in my hotel. Did you say your hotel Mr. Lott? Yes, I did say my hotel. Then you're quite wrong I'm afraid. It's mine. My husband's always buying me pubs. It's my hobby. I always say, one must do something. So do go away, Mr. Lott. If you don't believe me, ring up Cotton's Breweries. Now, Mr. Keith, when can you start? When can I what? You're going to manage this hotel for me. I decided that when I heard your views on the duties of innkeepers. But I have no qualifications, no practical experience. You're wearing blue, aren't you? Oh, yes. That takes guts. And you know good food, when you taste it. Of course. - And wine. - Certainly. You imagine that the late Lott has any of these qualifications? Well, no but-- Very well then. [music playing] Quentin. What on Earth is that? It's not a kangaroo, it's meant to be a Pelican. You know, its beak holds more than its belly cap. How coarse? Should be accurate. Ah, there's Higgins. - Where did you find that chap? Oh, he was in the repose with my brother Tuesday. And his cousin was in the Ark with my brother Thursday. What about Wednesday? Oh, he's in the army. QUENTIN: Kangaroo. [bell ringing] Morning, sir. Ready for captain rounds, sir? Very good, Higgins. How are staff settling down? - Oh, a bit slow at first, sir. But I think I've got them shipshape now. Good. But don't you worry, sir, we should be ready for action as soon as you open the house. Everything under control Truscott? - We're booking up nicely, sir. - Good. [music playing] [whistle blows] Captain's rounds. Well, put a jag in it. Bullock. Position. Ready for inspection, sir. Morning. ALL: Morning, sir. Yes, that's more like it. Shaping very nicely, Higgins. Good job. Well done, everybody. Ah, makes you want to cry, Saturday, ay? Just look at my stock. I know, Holly. Brewers do their best, but it's just the usual stuff. Yes. It's good rough drinking, but nothing for the trained palate so to speak. Got some news for you. Sir. My oldest brother, Sunday, do you know? Yeah. Selling down his cellar. Cognac? Gavazzi mostly. Contra? Kirsch. Kimmerle? Curacao? Russian star? [music playing] BENBOW [VOICEOVER]: [inaudible]. This means a masque, ay? Probably make a mess of that too. Here in Downy, we have that famous old Austin river Downy Pelican. We are now about to pass it on our left by. This ancient coaching inn is now being managed by the celebrated Oxford blue, Mr. Saturday Keith. [music playing] [birds chirping] Good day. Good morning, sir. Have you any accommodation? I should require a room with a bath for a few days. Uh, we've got some room, sir, but, uh, no private bathrooms, I'm afraid. I was afraid of that too. Would you please sign the register, sir? Certainly. How'd you do? My name is Keith, I'm the manager here. Hi, I'm Van Buren. All right, Truscott, I'll show Mr. Van Buren around. Very good, sir. Here's Lester, Elizabeth and Essex, sir. This way. What a charming place this is. So quiet and peaceful. You over here for long, Mr. Van Buren? No, I am expecting a call back to New York at any moment. My partner is a rather sick man. I heard my old friend Professor Benbow and his daughter Joanna were down here, and I'd hope to meet them. Much ahead. Thanks. There's got to be a law against men like that having children. - You think so? [non-english speech],, faithful and enduring. Well, you certainly had to be both when Elizabeth was on the throne. You know, these old rooms have a great charm for us Americans. A friend of mine at one transferred Bodley to Michigan, Boulevard. How did it look? Terrible. That's a very old and a very bad painting, if I may say so Mr. Keith. You may indeed. The story goes that it was sent here by Elizabeth some years after Essex's death. Indeed. [clears throat] You see there's a well-known legend-- [clears throat] Yes, Truscott. Her ladyship has arrived, sir. Uh, would you like to meet my mother? It'll be a pleasure. May I have this room Mr. Keith? Yes, of course. Truscott, send up Mr. Van Buren's luggage. Yes, sir. [birds chirping] Oh, thanks. Who are you? I'm a maid. Not permanent, I hope. No, don't go, I want to talk to you. I love talking while I work. You haven't been here long, have you? Long enough to know my way around, excuse me. Uh-huh. It's a charming hand. I'm a friend of Mr. Keith's. I suppose a man in his position must have all kinds of acquaintances. And so many opportunities. [screams] Uh, there you are. Hello, mother. Hello, darling. Oh, this is Mr. Van Buren. My mother, Lady Keith. - How do you do? How do you do? I'll just get them to rustle up some tea. Oh, lovely. Let's sit here. Thank you. You're an American. Yes. I can always tell. Americans have good teeth and bad complexions. [chuckles] And the English, are just the other way around. - Do you mind if I smoke? - I like it. Thank you. Are you a millionaire? Unfortunately, no. Ooh. When I was a girl, all Americans were millionaires. Made things so much easier, don't you think? Do you work? Well, I'm a collector, Lady Keith. [chuckles] Rent or rates? Well, I collect beautiful things, pictures, jewels, tapestries. I sell the ones that have no personal appeal to me to enable me to keep the ones that have. Damn, how fascinating. I wish I knew all about art. I don't even know what I like. Thank you. Now, milk and sugar. Thank you. Registration. Mobsters, bureaucratic red tape. Aah, so this is where you've ended up, ay? Gone into pub keeping. Very sensible of you, I'm sure. I must apologize. I'm afraid I was rather rude to you. Forget it, my dear boy. To paraphrase Voltaire, you talked unmitigated rubbish. But it's a free country. - That's very good of you. Don't be so meek about it. Write your trash if you want to, only don't expect me to read it. In fact, I've made an oath never to read anything of yours again. However, I've come down to see this masque you're putting on. I hope you didn't write it. Don't worry, sir, it was written 300 years ago. Age isn't always indicative of excellence. Our local folklore expert, Mrs. Horsefell-Hughes knows all about it. It was her idea to act it here in the garden. Sir, isn't that an American fellow over there. What's his name? - Van Buren. Yes, argumentative fellow but queer notions. Oh, well, I like him. You might go and see what my daughter is up to, will you? She's putting the car away. She's not safe with cars. Very well, sir. Oh, hello, sir. Hello, Holly. You're dressed again? Well, you've got to be cruel to be kind, sir. Want any help? No, thanks. Just finished. You're Miss Benbow? Yes. I don't believe it. You don't have to. It's a miracle. You mean that we got here? Because if we get anywhere, father's unsafe with cars. Yes, a miracle. I see. You're not ill or anything, are you? No. Are you staying here? Yes. It's my hotel. I mean, I manage it. Oh, you're Saturday Keith. Yes. I do hope you and father aren't going to be rude to each other again. I expect we shall. Seems to come naturally somehow. But look, how did he manage to have a daughter like you? He managed. But you're beautiful. You're really beautiful. You are a beauty. Aphrodite. Helen of Troy. Caper. [screams] Oh, I'm sorry miss. Do you always pursue your guests like this? Ha, she does teach the torches to burn bright. Her beauty hangs upon the cheek of night like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear. Blimey. Broad daylight too. I maintain categorically, sir, that William Shakespeare wrote Hamlet. My dear sir, Francis Bacon undoubtedly had-- Utter balderdash, sir. I will refute to my dying day the monster's accusation of that lean soul mean-minded petty fogging pentagon Francis Bacon ever wrote one single word of the play-- what is it, Joanna? Daddy, why don't you and Mr. Van Buren have a nice little shouting match after dinner? Yes, of course. Um, in any case, now, I present my daughter Joanna. - How do you do? - How do you do? And, uh, you remember Mr. Van Buren, of course. Glad to see you again. For you Miss Benbow with my apologies. Thank you. It's a very pretty gesture, Keith. A very pretty gesture indeed. There's rosemary, that's the remembrance. There's-- BOTH: Fellow for you and columbines. Quick, cross your fingers and wish. Shakespeare. Bacon. [laughter] Well, we must go and see about our rooms. I put you in the Walter Raleigh room, sir. Raleigh. Raleigh. And you Miss Benbow in the Gloriana. [bell ringing] Elmer Van Buren, I'm rather delighted to see you again. That's mutual. Do you ever run across to you that Queen Victoria wrote the works of Tennyson? Nor that Mr. Barclift wrote his daughter's verses? Oh, dear, I wish I knew who they were talking about. Did everyone write everyone else's poetry. So it seems. Who wrote yours dear? Professor Benbow, but don't tell. Uh, George, can you show the Professor and Miss Benbow their rooms? Yes, sir. Well, I'll see you later. Excuse me. Splendid fellow, Raleigh. Pipes and potatoes and all that. Who won a bed that Elizabeth slept in? Oh, naturally in the Essex room. This is one of his gloves. They were found here after Her Majesty had been visiting the house and the Earl was supposed to be somewhere quite different. If you look, you can see his monogram. I wonder where the other one is. Well, no one knows. Somewhere in the hotel according to local legend. I wonder if she ever got the ring. The ring? What did you read at Oxford? Oh, economics and psychology. A lot of pseudo scientific nonsense. If you read it anyway, educated, you'd know that Elizabeth sent Essex a ring. And tell him to send it back to her if he got into trouble. Well, he did get into trouble and got sent to the tar and sent back the ring. And didn't get any reply, and got his head cut off. Bruu! History told to the children. Did my heart love till now? For I swear it's sight. For I near saw true beauty till this night. Blimey, he's at it again. Oh, good afternoon, sir. What would you like? Scotch, please. There you go, sir. Lovely afternoon, isn't it? Hmm. Wonderful old house this. This house of yours seem to grow right out of the ground itself. My country they mostly build houses that stand on the surface that never look permanent. Oh, that wouldn't do for us, sir. Tell you funny thing. Whenever you see a deserted farmhouse in America, anywhere from New York to California, it's an ugly thing that you shudder it. But over here, a ruined house is-- well, it's glamorous. It's something you want to write poetry about. That's the main difference between my country and yours. Well, I just can't figure out what it signifies. Well, you know, perhaps it has something to do with all the years that people have been living in them, sir. Yes. But these old places could tell a tale or two. And this one more than some. You don't happen to know any secrets about the Pelican, do you? - No, I can't say I do, sir. After all, it's not my line of country, is it? What? No secret passages? No priest holds? Nothing of that sort? - No, sir. [scoffs] Pity. I think it's wonderful out here. But I don't understand it. Oh, I mean, I do understand it, but it's not like you. What are the critics going to say? Oh, nothing worse than they said about my last effort. Yes-- I'm sick of doing dreary little things. I want to do something really big for once. I may have made a fool of myself. Yes, but. I didn't expect you to be the first to say so. Oh, that wasn't what I was going to say. I'm all for it. Bigger and better, that's what I say. I'm kind of sensitive about it. I know. But like a mountain might be, if it was a smashing great elephant I'd be getting accustomed to ridiculous mice. Do you regard babas destiny as a mouse? Oh, blast, I've said the wrong thing again. Let's talk about something else before I put my foot right in it. Tell me, who's the new glamour puss you have here? Where did you meet her? In one of the bedrooms. Only she was in, I was out. I spoke to her she answered flick, like that. Huh, doesn't sound like her. She's rather quiet, reticent like a shop window with one hat in it. Oh, you obviously haven't got the right approach. She's not your type at all, Saturday. Too independent. Well, I don't mind independence, but the girl doesn't have to contradict everything she hears. Most definitely she's honest. People talk such rubbish nowadays. Anyway, this red haired beauty isn't-- Red haired? But Joanna is blonde. And who's Joanna? The girl I met is as red as the Kremlin. The girl I'm talking about, it's a maid of some sort. Oh, you mean Nelly Bly. Yeah, it's pretty girl, isn't she? - Yes. - Tell me about, Joanna. No, you'll meet her. Time for a pint. Isn't Nelly Bly a ridiculous name for a girl like that? I once knew a girl called Emily Stout. I know Anna Hill called Papa Cat-- papa-- yeah. A couple of pints, please Holly. I've done it Mr. Keith. I've done it twice. Both of them different, blue cocktail, sir. Nobody's ever made one like this before, not proper blue like this at least. Mr. Keith, I'm an inventor. Why that's great. Uh, what's the recipe? That's my secret, sir. Wild horses wouldn't drag it out of me. And quite right. Well I ask you, would Marconi have told? Would Edison, would Whittle? Well. Don't you tell them, Holly, it'll make our fortune. Pour for me your triumph. - Very good, sir. You know, this is the only notable thing that's happened to me since I was blown up by a landmine. They're blue. Can I have one? - Two, more Holly. Right you all, sir. Quentin, Professor and Miss Benbow, Quentin Cotton. BOTH: How do you do? Light or dark blue? Dark. The Oxford blue. We're not going to drink Cambridge in your pub whatever we do outside. There you are, Holly. They're christen for you. To you Mr. Holly. Gentlemen, I give Mr. Holly for his contribution to the art of life. - Oh, thank you. - Holly. - Mr. Holly. [blows nose] Cheer up. REPORTER [ON RADIO]: Racing at Newbury, 2 o'clock merry time. Sir Roger. Eager. 2:30, Pega Maheart, Margarita Jewel Star. 3 o'clock, night jar, black Peter. Caravan. 3:30, Jack Tar. I beg your pardon, sir. Good evening, sir. I want a room here for a few days? Yes, sir. Would you, um, please sign the register, sir. Uh, just, uh, just there, sir. There you go. Thank you. Have you any luggage? Yeah, there it is. Oh, yes. The, um, the Phillip Sydney room, sir, is vacant. I hear you have an Essex room. Uh, yes, sir. Is that vacant? Uh, I'm afraid not, sir. Hmm, what a pity. Yes, sir. Great pity. Yes, sir. As you can already see, we have a Mr. Elmer Van Buren staying here. Yes, sir. Yes. Um, straight up the stairs, sir. Thank you. Thank you, sir. REPORTER [ON RADIO]: You never know, and that's the end of the racing results for the day. [laughter] A magnificent effort considering the times. A most excellent dinner. Your son seems to have found his vocation, Lady Keith. Yes. Isn't it nice? All my sons are now settled. All men? How many have you? Seven. And all called after days of the week? Of course. And all of them poets? Oh, dear me, no. Saturday's the only one who who's given us any trouble. Uh, Keith, that dinner calls for a glass of port. Have you anything drinkable? He should have from Sunday Cellar. Why not try something different? I've got a surprise for you. Have you ever tasted lamb's wool? Did you hear what he said, father? Lamb's wool? What sort of drink is that? I've been experimenting with an old recipe. Added a few things of my own. I need some help, though. I was wondering if you, uh-- Of course. But who can make lamb's wool except lambs? [laughs] Silly boy. It's a very old English drink, Lady Keith. I once tasted it and I shall never forget it. Great. Heavens, what's that? It is. Can't be. I do believe it is. Professor Benbow. I don't suppose you remember me, Daisy Ray Horsefell-Hughes. I attended your summer school pitch in 1954. But, of course, you're the authority on the Danish poets, aren't you? - Well, I don't know that-- I'm delighted to meet you. Can I introduce you to Lady Keith, Miss Horsefell-Hughes. How do you do? Miss Ray Horsefell-Hughes Hughes, and this is Mr. Van Buren. How do you do? How do you do? And this is Mr-- Mr. Sedgwick. - How do you do? Do come sit down. Ooh, I'd love to. Oh, it is splendid to see you again, I've got so much I want to talk to you about. It's been ages. I've had a particularly interesting time because I've taken up mainly study of the 16th century poets, and I made a very special study of Campion. I do think he's moved awfully interesting. Do you happen to know about him? I think he's most interesting of all as a matter of fact. I-- I simply can't tell you how interesting, I think he is. [suspenseful music] Hello. Where are you going? To the Village Hawk. Oh, I see. May I join you? Of course, but, uh, Mr. Higgins is taking me, but I know the kitchen maid's looking for a partner. Tickets 2 and 6 including the buffet. Gold. I shall look forward to seeing you. Good evening. Evening, sir. A couple of sugar, Higgins. Half and half of course, there's much to share. Did you hear me, Higgins? Yes, sir. And now certain spices and two eggs. Two, eggs, Higgins. Uh, mace, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg. I'll put them in. Good. 3 eggs. You're sleeping, Higgins. - No, sir. Your brother Tuesday is handsome, less uncooperative. Good. This probably means sausages for breakfast, but here goes. Of course, in Miss Beaton day, you know, ratio was a dozen. Now, a glass of whiskey. Oh, whiskey. That's Holly's department, sir. You know, you really do this sort of thing rather well, don't you? - What do you mean? Mixing drinks? No, the whole thing. Running pubs and making us feel at home. I'm glad you think I'm good at it. I regard it as rather important. Let me have a go. Here, not widdershins. it's unlucky. Anticlockwise. Oh. Smells good. What about poetry, are you writing? Yes, I've just started on something rather big. [clears throat] Oh, hello Higgins. Hello, sir. Holly is inclined to be touchy, sir. He considers drinks his pitchy. Oh, not this drink. Miss Horsefell-Hughes and Mr. Sedgwick have come alongside, sir. Good, are they happy? Well, not Mr. Sedgwick, sir. Of course, not worthy. He's supposed to have written the greater part, the masque himself. He stayed a night in the Essex room here to get inspiration. And the outcome was of course pure poetry. He wrote the most exquisite iambic pentameter. Oh. Oh, I'm so sorry but my head is going round and round. Forgive me Lady Keith, there we go again. And me. And me. And Mr. Sedgwick. Ah, at last. Ooh, wine. Enter the 7 to Bacchus for the steaming nectar. Standby to spice the main drink. My eyes are big. Of course, this is the traditional Saturday, right? [chatter] Would you mind, sir? Pass me ram, will you? Certainly. I thought it long. Thank you. And another. What does one toast to in lamb's wool? To drinking another lusts of the flesh. To redheads. To crime. To my guests. To the Downy Pelican. To-- to-- to poetry. [birds chirping] [dog barking] Good morning. Good morning. Will you rush this, please. It's urgent. Hmm. We don't know about rush, Miss. Not often we get telegrams here. [bell ringing] Well, did you enjoy that installment? Oh, I'm awfully sorry, I just came in to buy a stamp. And being fond of reading. Only stories with happy endings. That should be right. I think-- I can't stand those gloomy Russians. My first husband was a Cossack. Did you say your first husband? Perhaps, I should have said my only husband. I gave Boris my youth, my faith. Everything. After him, nobody mattered. No, I suppose not. You won't say anything of this to Mr. Keith, will you? There's nothing to be ashamed of but, well, I-- I have to make my own living now. Of course, I understand. Well, I knew you would. You've got such a kind gloomy face just like a Russian. Has it? Have I really? By the way, perhaps you could tell me, I've always wanted to know about the Cossacks. How do they do this trick of riding under the tummies of their horses? I haven't a clue, I'm afraid. You see, Boris was a foot Cossack. Good morning, sir. All the question of balance, Van Buren. Just watch this. Right. Right. Right. Blast! Aha, too easy. Tell me, this collecting business, what's the idea? You can't take it with you. No, but there is something in possessing beauty while you can. Yes, I know. I met a fellow once, we had a Rembrandt. Kept it locked in the cellar and took it out once a year to look at it. Said he bought it off a crook, obviously stolen goods. Must be mad. Could be. Good morning. Good afternoon. Tell me, who is that egregious nincompoop? I think his name is Williams. He checked in last night. Do they keep lemonade in the bar? Yes, madam. I need a stimulant. Everyone so cleaver here. Good morning. Good morning, milady. Oh, how very pretty. What are they? Cocktails, milady. I've never drunk a cocktail, but these are so pretty. Do you think one would hurt me? Put new life in there milady. Delicious. Just like elderberry wine. I've been quite teetotal since dear King Edward's coronation. 9th of August 1902. How clever of you. I wish I could remember things like this. Ah, well, you see, you should have been a smoker, milady. A smoker? Ooh. If you want to know things, that is. Look, all on cigarette cards, all the different series. British Birds. Railway engines, this is a handy series. Al Amanda bus pipe. Whooho, what kind of a pipe? Well, any old pipe. Confound that man, Williams. Caught me of my stroke. Lost me the game. Well, never mind. Thanks Bert Aah. Tell me, what you think of this Keith fellow? I like him. I must admit he grows on me like rather a curious kind of Ivy. He's very attracted by Miss Benbow. Miss Benbow had better not be attracted by him. Why? What have you got against him? Bruu! Read his versus? - No. Are they that bad? Lamentable. You'd look pretty silly if he turned out to be good. You've got it all wrong. A critic's perfectly safe so long as he condemns everything, good or bad. It's when he begins to praise something that he has to look out for his reputation. From what I understand, yours is in no danger. Ah, Joanna. [chuckles] Hello, there. Hello. I'll see you both at dinner. What have you been up to? Saturday Keith has been telling me about his poetry. Bruu! Great heavens. Van Buren likes the fellow, do you? Well? He's rather sweet. Joanna, I recognize the symptoms and I won't have it. That any daughter of mine should refer to an illiterate puppy as rather sweet. What a nauseating statement. I will not have you casting sheep's eyes to that unlettered buffoon. Oh, keep your beard on, daddy. You astonish me, miss. You astonish me. Do calm down, dear, Saturday's coming. Since when do you call him Saturday? Since this minute. Hello, sir. I, um-- would you like a drink Miss Benbow? My daughter does not drink. You mustn't mind daddy, he's just lost at croquet. Do you play? No, I'm afraid golf's my game. And mine. Why say, do you think we might play? Well, why not? Tomorrow? - Tomorrow. - Explorers. Mm-hmm. Film stars. Poor dears, always being discovered. So embarrassing for them. Famous jewels. Oh, I'm so fond of jewellery. My husband was always taking mine to be mended to a place called Hock. Oh look, the Kohinoor, the Hope Diamond. Oh, and Lord Essex ring. Lord Essex. Oh, Mr. Van Buren was telling me he stayed here once, you know. Really? Mm-hmm. It's a very large ring, isn't it? It is. Hmm, I feel so warm. I'm just going to sit-in the sun. Ooh. Oh, may I borrow your album? Well-- I'll take great care of it. Thank you so much. [hiccup] Ooh, sorry. Is it Thursday or Friday? It's Wednesday. Don't be absurd, Wednesday has a mustache. Silly, man. [music playing] I've decided to investigate you. You're a bit of a mystery, young Nelly. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Why? For trying to take advantage of the innocent redhead? In fact for taking advantage? [screams] NELLY BLY: Ah. Stop it. Let me go. That was only a sighting shout, an outer at 5 o'clock. I can prove on that. You have the most beautiful spine I've ever seen. Oh, Quentin, you've made things so much easier for me. Now, I can trust you and tell you everything. I can trust you? But of course. And you'll help me? Of course. Without reward? Of course, I-- I may declare a bonus. No, not now. You haven't heard my story yet. Then tell me. No. No, tonight. Will you meet me at 11 o'clock by the well? I will. Tonight then. Oh, hello. Hmm, just as I thought, very pretty set up. Can I help you, sir? Oh, no, no. I was just having a look round this lovely old room. [music playing] [SINGING] Half a world away from half a government. Being too mean. Half awake I pray that all the little dreams will see. Do space. No, I've never been to Bournemouth. I know Eastbourne intimately but not Bournemouth. Three diamonds. And we met such interesting people there. And Mrs. Silverstein and her sister Miss Priscilla Littlejohn. They recommended us to come here. They simply raved about Mr. Keith. Four hearts. Today. I suppose he is attractive if you like that type. From what I could gather from Mrs. Silverstein, she is Mrs. Martinson. He's quite a menace. Five diamonds. I'm not surprised. Some happy rumors. Mrs. Silverstein hinted at quite a scandal. I couldn't get her to be more explicit but still. Oh, is it my bid? Uh, six diamonds. Double. Well, poets always regard themselves as chartered libertines. Rather shocking, isn't it? 7 clubs. I know Pricillah Littlejohn. Mr. Keith treated her shamefully. Seven diamonds. Double. Re double. Pricillah Littlejohn has taken to the bottler I hear. Really? Yeah. Such a nice simple girl too. And now with a new look, her legs really don't matter. Nice people, hmm? Charming. No bid, Mrs. Walter, how's you contracted to make a grand slam in diamonds, doubled and redoubled? Do mind if we not play some bridge? Well. Look not into my eyes with fear. [mumbling] [dog barking] Oh, Nelly. Quentin. You're late. And you're dreaming. I walked right up to you before you saw me. I thought you were a moonbeam. Nelly, Nelly, you're the loveliest housemaid I ever kissed. And you're the nicest follower I ever have. We came here to talk. Well, we are talking in between times. No, you're suspicious of me. You must listen. All right, my darling. The night is young. Well, we met in Split. I beg your pardon? Split. Very blue the Adriatic. I was young and-- and lonely. He was experienced, dynamic. You mean Boris? Who? Oh, oh, B-- no. Elmer Van Buren. Oh, Elmer Van-- oh, but he's not-- he's a collector. Collected me. I wrote him letters, foolish letters and he kept them. Now, he's trying to blackmail my-- my father. - Your father? Yes, don't ask me who my father is, but if those letters were published he'd be ruined. I see. So when I saw you this morning you were-- Exactly. I was trying to find the letters. Let me do it. I'll go in there and beat him and I'll chew him. Oh, and shh. No, I-- I must do this my own way. But, uh, you can help. How? Watch him. Let me know whenever he's not in his room. I'm sure he keeps them there. And above all, don't draw attention to me. Of course. But hasn't he recognized you? Oh, I'm keeping out of his way. Anyhow, you-- you don't suppose a fiend like that remembers every girl he's deceived? I still think I should beat him. No, don't do that. You know, you're really rather sweet. You can, uh, have that bonus now if you'd like. Excuse me, sir, would you just sign this, please, sir? Thank you. Did you fix it at the food office, Truscott? A very pleasant interview, sir. Good. Goodnight. Goodnight, Nelly. Well, I'm just about at it, sir. I'm [inaudible] now. Goodnight. Goodnight, Holly. Well, I think I'll be popping off now too, sir. Goodnight, Truscott. Goodnight, sir. Aah, the plot thickens. What have you been up to? My lips are sealed. They're a bit pink too. Hmm? [laughs] Blast you! Good night. Good night, sweet, Quentin. And flights of housemaids sing thee to thy rest. [birds chirping] SATURDAY KEITH: Oh, closed it. JOANNA: Bad luck. Oh, this ruff is hopeless. Never mind. It's an awfully nice wood. Ooh, well, look. Would you care to marry me? Yes. No. No. I mean, no. Why? Well, a huge reason I suppose. Oh, but I hardly know you yet. Well, think what a chance I'm offering you to get acquainted. That sounds rather like going inside the lion's cage to get a good view of the lions. - Oh, no, Joanna, I'm serious. No, I'm not going to kiss you. I'm not going to marry you. I haven't had time to think. Besides, it's so early. It isn't 4 o'clock. [laughter] Do you start at 4:00? No, I don't start at all. No, I'm not going to kiss you. I'm not going to marry you. I'm never going to marry you. Is that quite clear? But even if you don't marry me-- I suppose you're not used to opposition. What do you mean? Fairly obvious, isn't it? [birds chirping] You look so silly skulking behind this thing. Hey. Oh, my skirt. Oh, Saturday, it's torn. Let me go. - And will you marry me? - No. - Why not? Lots of reasons. What about Priscilla Littlejohn? Oh, good heavens, who the devil told you about her? Never mind. But it seems to be true. Well, even if it is true, it doesn't matter. Well, since you've asked me to marry you, I'd say it does matter. And since you refuse me, a comment in the least. Well, of course, if you're content to accept my refusal. No, but I'm not. Why do you suppose I asked you? I thought perhaps you might have formed the habit. Listen, I've never proposed to anyone before, and I've certainly never married anyone else. So what difference would it make? A lot of difference. How? Be honest, tell me how. I don't quite know. But I'm not going to let you kiss me again. Not even when we're married? - You won't want to then. So we are going to be married? Well, certainly not if you never want to kiss me afterwards. But I didn't say that. But you did, or at least you inferred it. Oh, my head's going round and round. That's what comes of losing it so often. Hey. I'll speak to your father tonight. Oh, blasted! Don't cry, Joanna. I'm sorry, darling. I'm a clumsy idiot, but I do love you. I'm not crying really but why the Dickens didn't you say so. [screams] [laughter] [bell ringing] Oh, Higgins, what's the time? The time, sir? Yes. The real time. I mean not all this bell nonsense. Why, 5 o'clock, sir. Good heavens. The little mink has been playing that absurd game since half past 2. Uh, You're not a golfer, sir. I'm not. I play chess and croquet, and I'm profoundly grateful to say that I'm equally bad at both of them. Games are the curse of our civilization. Can you imagine Shakespeare playing hockey or Goethe playing golf? Uh, Miss Benbow on the pub now, sir. - Ah, there you are, my dear. - Hello. - Good evening, Keith. - Good evening, sir. Take her away, Higgins, I want to talk to you. All right, sir. See you later. Right. What's happened to your skirt? Well, you see daddy, Saturday was chasing me through a wood. The unspeakable, Sata. The unmentionable missile. And he made me cry too. Did he by him? Yes. And he kissed me. Assault and battery. But I made him sorry for it. I told him a few home truths. Splendid. Now, he knows exactly what I think of him. Excellent. And what I think is that I'm going to marry him. What? Blood pressure. Ah, that's better. I should watch my blood pressure. I enjoy good raise myself. We all do. But when you get to my age, it's dangerous. Excuse me. What's the matter with him? I don't know. He's most unsociable fellow. Furtive too. It's most unfair but I can't get it out of my mind that because I dislike him, there must be something wrong with him. Grave error, sir, I agree. But surely it's worse thing that because you like somebody that can't be anything wrong with him. For instance the American bloke Van Buren. Do you like him? Everybody seems to like him. Very likeable fellow. Beats me at croquet, and I beat him at chess. Ah, you see. He's fooled you just as he's fooled all the others. But not me, who if I could only tell you. Great, heavens, boy are you insinuating there's something wrong with Van Buren? My lips are sealed. Hmm, blood pressure. Have you been maddening the Professor? - No. - What'd you say to him? Oh, I just said my lips are sealed and he went off like a bomb. I particularly wanted him in a good mood this evening. What were you talking about? I was warning him against Van Buren. Now, I bet you're going to tell me you like him. Van Buren? Of course, I do. I'm quite fond of the old boy. Old fiend. Haven't you noticed the look in his eye? What look? This look. Don't do that, that's a good chap. No, honestly, I wouldn't trust him an inch. Not with any girl I knew. I mean, anyone I was fond of for instance. Nelly Bly for instance. Well. Do you mean to tell me do you think Van Buren has been making a pass at Nelly? - Well, no. Not exactly. Oh, serious Saturday, this is serious. Trouble with you old boy is you've got a bad attack of housemaids knees. [suspenseful music] "Tennis Will Proceed," a poem by Saturday Keith. [suspenseful music] Well, don't let me disturb you, Nelly. I was looking for Mr. Keith. Oh, it's quite all right, Lady Keith, I'm just finished. But of course you understand we can't guarantee-- just a minute. I beg your pardon, madam. Yes. I will attend to the matter personally madam. Nelly, Lady Mercy Cotton is arriving any minute now. Run upstairs and see that her room's all right. She's in the Ben Johnson. - In a minute Mr. Truscott. No. No, no. Hurry along now. Everything must be right for Lady Mercy. [knocking on door] Come in. Uh, Keith. Come and help me with this confounded tie, will you? I, um, I asked Joanna to marry me today. I hope she refused you. As a matter of fact she didn't. Then the girl's a bigger fool than I took her for. No, I don't mean that. You can't get it right. I have nothing against you as a man, but as a poet I think you're disastrous. Well, if you insist on having a major poet for a son-in-law, Joanna's chances of getting married are not so hard. Not so tight. You don't understand what I mean. If a man sets out to do something, I expect him to do it well. You set out to be a poet, but have you succeeded? That seems to be the point. At the moment I'm a publican rather than a poet. And as far as it goes, rather successful one. Oh, blast it! Exactly, as far as it goes. But in my opinion, the mere fact that an unsuccessful poet becomes a successful publican is no qualification for marrying my daughter. You don't know anything about my poetry. You loved it. You haven't read my last poem. You don't know what it's like. I do and I know it's good. What do your publishers say about it? Well, they haven't seen it yet. So the opinion's entirely you own? Yes. Very well. If you're prepared to stand or fall by this particular poem, I suggest we postpone our discussion until it's published. Then, if competent critics in the general public are on your side, I won't contradict them. So we have to wait for months? Months? My dear wife and I were engaged for seven years. Hmm, that must have been cozy for you. After all it seems to me that you're so confident in your ability, I'm the one who's taking all the risks. What do you think? Yes, all right. I'm afraid I've been rather impertinent. It's not a bad thought sometimes. Now, how about a drink before dinner? You know, I almost hope your poem is a success. Entirely remarkably good though. Thank you, sir. Nelly? Oh, Quentin. The very man I was looking for. What is there? No, silly. Quentin, I think I've got a clue. That's more than I have. What it's all about? - Come and give me a hand. MERCY COTTON: Come down and help me with the costume. DAISY HORSEFELL HUGHES: Lightest thought. There you go Sedgwick MERCY COTTON: And that's the jumper. Yes, come along with it. Please, lead. That's right. That's right, Henry. Bring the bags into the hall. Yeah, hand me what you've got there. Will you now take what you can't manage? I think I've got that hat and this. I'll just have a look and see if he's left any. None at all. Come on down. Here we are at last. I thought we'd never make it. - How do-- Oh, don't bother to introduce yourself, I'll soon find out who you are. You all know me, of course. Where's Mr. Keith? - Oh, he's-- Oh, it doesn't matter. Here are the clothes. - Oh, good. - Come on. Are you all right? Yeah. Hello, everybody. I said it is getting exciting, isn't it? Hello, Professor. I say we're counting on you to be one of our courtiers. - Delighted, I'm sure. - This should be fun. I borrowed them from the Old Vic. They didn't want to lend them. [interposing voices] --a short prologue. I don't know whether you happen to be a quick study. But I really-- Well, I'm sure you'll manage prettily. Your dressed as an Elizabethan page. Oh, I say, what fun. Yeah, I think it will be. Hello, Mr. Cotton. Good evening. What's the matter with Quentin? Nothing mother. You look pale and guilty. I'll see about that later. I've got such good news for you. The Vic has got the mumps and you are Essex. Oh, I can't really. Mother. - You've got to. You've got to. Where's his hat? There. No, surely, somebody else, perhaps could do it. You'll look absolutely splendid in this. One, two, you are Essex. Now, watch my feet very carefully, people. Are you ready? 1 and, 2 and. 1 and, 2 and. Altogether. 1 and, 2 and. Where's your partner, dear? He'll be here this afternoon. We can't do it without a rehearsal. I'll take his place. Oh, watch your self. - Keep going. Oh, you keep going, Lady Mercy. Keep going Yes, don't forget we're in the 16th century. Oh, how stupid of me. It's all right. Now look, think think, concentrate. Now, who's hands do I have right now? - Is this big as it is? - No. No. Keep counting, keep counting. Now, is everybody smiling? You're very happy, you know. Yes. [inaudible] You're not going to have this ready by this afternoon. Never mind Miss Ray. It looks quite finished. Does it really? Oh, good. I'd like you to have another go now. Come on everybody, start right again. Are you ready? Most royal sovereign. Essex bends his knee in loving homage. At your slender feet, he throws his heart. At one glance from your eye, his cosmic sun thunder in his ears. But a deep sigh rises from his breast. I say, how are we going to utter this utter bosh? Oh, cheer up, Quentin, you look very pretty. Well, I can't say we thank him. What's going on in here? Can you spare a minute? It very soothe my Lord, right willingly. How do I look, Saturday? Come into the office and I'll tell you. All right, now, keep going keep going. Are we looking happy. Ah, Truscott, I've got a tip for you. A tip, sir? Confidence trick. Confidence trick. 330, 331. Here's a five, I have a bid. - Ooh. And I'll split my winnings with you if you telephone my bookie at Regent double 6 7, double 7. 25 is the win. Ah, do it from the public. I don't want anyone here to get it. Very good, sir. I have a surprise for you. Shut your eyes. All right. Now, come over here. Stand there. No peeping. What? What's the matter? Well, my poem is gone. I left it here last night. Somebody has taken it. Oh, no, Saturday. Well, I put it in here. No. Well, where can it be? It's the only copy. - Perhaps you took it upstairs. Well, I'm sure I didn't. We'll go and look. Here, you've been behind my bar. Me? You. - I haven't been near it. - Oh, sir. Not just now. But sir. Oh, Mr. Quentin, you know my cocktail recipe? It's gone. It's been stolen, sir. Have you searched Mr. Van Buren? Mr. Van-- You're joking, sir. I wish I could get my hands on that teeny. Ah, Mr. Williams, you've made a discovery. May I look? Could you write it again from memory? Not a chance. It's a 12,000 works. VAN BUREN: You don't say. Hey, now, what's going on in there? Good heavens, it's the missing glove. How thrilling. Where on Earth did you find it? Ask Williams. In here. Oh. I love it. Those were there too. I've got an idea, why don't you wear them. - Can I? - Well, it's the perfect touch. We'll go and get the other one. - But Saturday, your poem. Really can't be far, we'll find it later. [music playing] This is the argument. That Venus then took mortal shape. Transformed into a queen, she clasped Lord Essex in divine embrace while Gloriana slept her maiden sleep in violet. While heaven stood on god, and all the stars came out as sentinel. [applause] [trumpets blowing] [laughter] [applause] [laughter] My Lord Essex. Most royal sovereign, Essex bends his knee in loving homage. At your tender heart, he throws his feet. At one throb. At one throb from your pulse his ears make bit of thunder in his eyes. Had a deep breath surprises from his thighs. [laughter] Come on Mr. Sedgwick, you missed your entrance. My brother Philip's messenger on horse. What is the news he brings us with such haste? [trumpets blowing] Come on, Mr. Sedgwick, let me help you. That's right. [laughter] Where is my brother's messenger on horse? What was the news he brings us in such haste? [trumpets blowing] Could you possibly unlace me? I'm frightfully tight. The horsemen should come now. Unless his horse has taken queer and foaming lies without. To meat-- to meet the gentleman with that. What on Earth happened? The beastly horse won't budge. How ghastly. Hi, Nelly, enjoying it? Say something. [applause] The quality of mercy is not strained. It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the Earth beneath. What on Earth has happened? [inaudible], Cedric. [laughter] Cedric. Oh, Saturday has been telling me about that glove. How terribly exciting. May I hold it? Yes. Oh, look at that jewel in the ring. They're both covered with jewels. Miss Benbow, do you collect cigarette cards? No, why? Oh, you should. May I borrow it to compare it with something? Yes, of course. Thank you. [laughter] Oh, hello. Good afternoon Miss Benbow. Aren't you out watching the masque? Never mind that. This little bottle contains vitriol. Unless you do exactly as I say, I shall be obliged to throw the contents on your very charming face. What are you playing? Walk into Mr. Cotton's car. I and my little bottle will accompany you. Now, get going. [applause] [screams] Quiet. Another sound out of you and I will use this. Now, get in. Oh, no you don't. Hey. Hey, come back. [engine roars] Lady Keith. Look. Lady Keith, Williams has taken Joanna Benbow away in Quentin's car. He seems to be threatening her. - Oh, don't be silly, child. It's true. Tell the others to follow. Tell the others to follow. What? Mr. Williams? Ooh. Ooh. [music playing] Stop. Stop. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Please, stop. It's Mr. Williams, he's eloped with Joanna in Quentin's car. What? Mr. Williams has threatened her. Who? Nelly? Oh, no, no, Joanna. That is and dearly I hope. Dear, oh dear. Oh darling, you're ill. I'm not, I'm not. Go and see. The cars are gone, I tell you. And Joanna, with Williams. And Billy. Mr. Sedgwick, where have you been? [trumpets blowing] Hi, wait for us. Stop. - Stop. - Blast! Now what? My rose is gone. Holly's car. Follow me to the courtyard. Get in, Holly. - Ay? Get in, get in. Don't ask any questions. Get in. Ahoy, get in. Section stations. Miss Benbow has been kidnapped by Mr. Williams. All right, come in milady. [chatter] Wait until I lay my hands on that mean soul. [inaudible] bad man. Wait till I lay my hands on him. Hey, hold up. Oh, let me take it. Don't stop me now, I'll see you later. You [inaudible] this afternoon? What's going on down there at the Downy? It's Miss Benbow, she's been kidnapped. Uh. Ay? It's Miss Benbow, she's been kidnapped. [laughs] Traveling at 60 mile an hour. That's a bit fast for a built up area. Don't you understand, Miss Benbow might be murdered by now. Driving to the public danger at that speed. Sorry, Mr. Higgins, I'll have to take your name. What is it? Step on it, Holly. Step on it. Ay? Oh, Sorry. Can't you get this resonating matchbox to go a bit faster? Well, I've got my foot right down, Professor. Oh, blimey! Rastard surp. Get a move on you, item. Ballads! Hey, look, Jordan. [chatter] Are you all right? [chatter] Why aren't you keeping the right side of the road? Oh, she's all right. - Are you all right, miss? - Oh she's all right, all right. So medical she's doing all right. Though we didn't know. If there's anything we can do miss. Are you sure you're all right? - I'm all right. Oh, come on, she's all right. Let's go. All right. Mr. Williams, is this some sort of ridiculous joke? Oh, no. No, I'm a criminal Miss Benbow. High class criminal. Hey, stop. Are you all right? Yes, I'm all right. But any luck we'll catch. They forked left. Right, no left. Get out. Uh, the gloves, please. - The gloves? - Yes. Yes. The glove which was found in the Essex room this afternoon. Why, I don't understand. May I have it please, Miss Benbow. I haven't got it. I didn't want to have to use force, my dear young lady. But I haven't. There. [groans] - Where is it? Where is it? I don't know. Lady Keith had it. She wanted to-- Lady Keith. [suspenseful music] It's Williams, he's alone. Turn back. No, Joanna. Williams on the road. Turn the car around, Holly. Turn the car around. Oh, Saturday. Joanna, darling. Oh, Saturday. - Did he hurt you? - Oh, no, I'm all right. But hurry, we must get back to the Pelican. He's after the ring. - Oh, what ring? Never mind, come on. I'll tell you on the road. As I were saying, it's no excuse you saying-- Now, look here, you and I have been pals for a long time. --you was on urgent business. There he go, it's him. It's Williams and he's alone. Who? All goes like running [inaudible].. Hey, come back here. [suspenseful music] - I think that awesome-- - Where's-- where's Lady Keith. - We-- I-- - Come on. And where's Lady Keith? She's in her room, sir. [knocking on door] Lady Keith. The Tudors who's emblem is the rose. Combination of the roses of York and Lancaster Lady Keith. Add Tudor herbs. Such spices. [suspenseful music] Where's Mr. Williams? He went up to see Lady Keith. Well, come on quick. W-- uh. Oh. Oh. It's murder. She's dead. I hope not. Don't do it, Wendy. Come on. Come on, oh dear. Come on. Are we going back to my daughter? When the body works. And I'm getting short of juice. I haven't got, sir. [groans] Go on, take it easy. Ooh. Ooh. Everything's under control, milady. Excellent. Where's Lady Keith? She's upstairs, milady. She's all right. Only she's been drugged. I'll deal with you later. Now, there. Holly, lend us a hand. All right, Mr. Truscott, you leave him to me. Ah, Joanna, thank heavens you're safe. Yes, I'm all right. Get me out of this mobile sardine. Where's Williams? I don't know. Now, where is he? Well done, Higgins. Good for you. I caught him in your mother's room, sir. My mother? Is she all right? Well, she's all right now, sir. No, thanks to this here perisher. She was drugged. - Don't blame me. She was like that when I got here. [growl] Hold him. Hold him. Professor. That's the idea. Yeah. I mean, you can go faster than that can't you? SATURDAY KEITH: Don't be no fool. Nelly, wait, I want to talk to you. There's no time now, I must go. Why? Because I'm a journalist, and I think I can see a front page story in this. [interposing voices] A journalist? Helen Blaisdell of the Picture Mail. I'm present writing a feature called Ancient Ins of England. Excuse me. [groans] My toe. Oh. Don't be an old fool, sir. Oh. All right. We can manage. Salacious beast. Now, what about that ring. Search me. I mean literally [inaudible] indend to. I admit I was after the ring but someone was ahead of me. Who? May I take it that I'm free to go now? There's a little matter of kidnapping. Yes, by him. Don't daddy, it was all a mistake. Mistake my foot. Well, if I tell you who has got the ring, will you let me go? - Yes. - Right. It was Van Buren. Nonsense. I told you he was a fiend. Isn't that so, Nelly? Shh. Did I hear my name taken in vain? Ah, there you are Keith. Sorry to leave you at this time, but I've just had a cable, my partner is a rather sick man and I've got-- Sorry to see you go, sir. Well, ask him if he minds being searched. - Yes. - Do you mind? You're being asked, Quentin. But this is absurd. Williams obviously stole the ring and has hidden it somewhere. Since you arrived, nobody has mentioned a ring. How did you know it was stolen? [gasps] Oh, I say. Goth. Vandal. Hung. All my life I have searched for this jewel. Every clue was followed-up, every rumor traced to its source. And I learned it was here in the Essex room. I know you want to understand Professor but it is possible in your life there are things you value more than honesty, and in yours too Keith. Even though you wouldn't sell the ring. It isn't mine to sell. It belongs to history. Now, you better go. But aren't you going to have him arrested? No. Thanks. Wise of you. The scandal wouldn't have done any of us any good. Now, either you're off duty or you're on duty. If you're off duty, the public bar's around the corner. And if you're on duty, where's your warrant? Uh. [laughs] Come on. Come on, Trusty. That's weird, isn't it? Holly, a glass of breadly for Lady Keith. Make it two. I could do with one myself. A sword, sir. Damned Vince. [laughs] Oh, Mr. Holly, here is your album. Thank you, madam. Thank you so much. It really is the most interesting book. The cards have lovely pictures on the front and instructions on the back on how to make things. Mr. Holly made up such a lovely drink from series 38 number 18. I think he called them blue cocktails. Now, sir, we've got to get something settled once and for all. - Have we? Keith, what's that? Keep calm, Nadia. Saturday and I have made up our mind. Yes, and it's quite obvious after what happened today that you need someone to look after her. She's got me. Yes, and a fat lot of good you are. She's constantly being kidnapped and abducted under your very beard. - What? No, wait a minute, I agreed to wait until my poem is published. I thought at the time it was fatuous thing to do. Now, there is no poem until I've written another one. So again, get married poem or no poem. Thief. Hung. Vandal. - Goth, dear. Thank you, darling. Goth. Hypocrite. There you were standing like a-- - Buddha. Nonsense child, Buddhas always sit. SATURDAY KEITH: Clasping your thing-- Nelly, are you really a journalist? Quentin, you don't think I'd tell you a lie, do you? Don't look at me like that. Now, listen, Nelly, you and I going to have a nice long chat. I want to hear all about Saturday's poem and Van Buren. Oh, and Boris, of course. And Split and the Picture Mail. And why you're masquerading as a housemaid. Quentin, you're a beast and a cheat. And after that, darling, we'll talk about other things, your eyes for instance and that innocent look you put on. We're just going to tell a complete whopper. Now, about that poem. Well, I was out in the garden and well, suddenly, something whiz past my head. The Earth is the ship teles sailing through space. That's a very good idea. And space is the sea. That constitutes the Alexandrians dragging their slow length along. You've got it, the slow surge of the sea. And the heroic couplets, of course. - Daddy? - Yes, dear. Is this a good poem? Good? It's a major work. If it weren't, I wouldn't be discussing it. Shows tremendous promise. Now, as I was saying Keith-- what is it Joanna? Daddy, you and mother were engaged for seven years. Seven happy years. Well, Saturday and I are getting married in seven weeks, so do you mind if we start now? What? Seven weeks? Well, yes, of course. [laughs] [chatter] Oh, look. [inaudible] much more. Oh, it was a lover and his lass. With a hey and ho, and hey nonino. [inaudible]. Ewe. [laughter] [music playing]
