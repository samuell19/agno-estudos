I was proud of you. I don't need anyone who is proud of me. I did that for me. This, no, sorry ... Carla, get involved, okay? Thomas, I don't need this! OK. A little hasty if you ask me but ... "Anxiety" is a term from the Indo-European. From "ango". That means as much as ... "cramped" or "cornered". And that's what it's about here. Free yourself from it. You want me just see naked. That's exactly what I mean Don't you really understand what I say? Carla, you're scared. You are anxious. And I help you. Why are we here? Be naked and you are vulnerable. But imagine: Nothing happens to you. I'm with you. Trust life again, Carla. No matter what was done to you. - But are you looking? No of course not This is about more important things. It's about your trauma. Trauma? You called it that. - It's called that. Who is "man" now? - The police. Hello, as always? What happened to me in the refugee home happened ... - turn around. ...that was not nice. Maybe the guy wouldn't have done anything. Maybe he was traumatized from the crossing across the oh so cold Mediterranean. - You are so blatant sometimes! The man in the home wanted to rape you The touch could have been a coincidence. That's why he was naked. He has changed. - In front of the women's toilet. There are not many places in the home ... I reach for a can I want to tear them open. But he didn't Because you were lucky man, Carla! You speak like the typical victim forgive me. You want a terrible one Not admit the facts. Shut up, shut up. I as a cop have to deal with it every day. With people who are afraid can no longer live. So here! Soft color wish? Shut up, shut up! Dry for eight minutes, then put on. Have a nice evening. Uh-huh. Man knock! Excuse me. You have to talk something over. I am busy. But it is important. Watch out. Can you think of what between dad and me? Hm? Yes I mean ... You also notice that ... That the air is out of there? And? Well, I got an idea and... I want to ask you if you help me. By which? It has to get going again. I thought to myself, bit jealousy? Can't hurt, can it? What do I have to do with that? He trusts you. Look ... You just had to stick him that you think I have a lover. Hm? Seriously? Thank you. Now don't mess around that long, right? Do not forget, to sort out your books. Night! We don't have that much space anymore. You too, my lady. Sleep well Close the door! - Sorry. Also elsewhere anticipation spread Because since his wife moved out, had the market leader helped themselves up with no other Fire accelerator XL? Nixe74? I am Janine. Haile. - Hey.

The botanicals for this tonic are in the Andes at 1742 m ... Your life is rather boring, isn't it? Oh, nonsense! I have dealing with people every day. It's never boring. For example, today a customer wanted have any kind of chips. It's done, because they weren't in stock. We had to Let sit in front of the door - unfortunately. And do you know what the crazy thing is? The variety does not exist He would have invented that. Crazy, isn't it? What kind of kind was that? - No matter, that's not the point. I was interested in the person behind it. What happens in such a person? I am with my employees asked, and they knew him. He always has sausage cuts bought from us. But there's no more. Hence the anger. I feel the despair of the guy totally went to the heart. And then I didn't torch long. - Mhm. Everyone can change the world. Fuck regulations. Zack, boom! Now there is again. - Whom? Strand sections.
