I heard that Celadon Goryeo is worth billions Same with winning the lottery Look at Namdaemun Even though it is the number 1 national treasure, it still has a national soul There's no point in saying that Why? Can't sell, it's no use Burning and screaming to fix things What is the true cultural heritage Which is not easily accessible to most people Like designer handbags in department stores You can buy it if you have money Like two noble ladies Only real upper class people recognized its value And it's kind of a limited edition Look at this Engraving that looks simple but beautiful Smooth grooves from bottle mouth to bottom of bottle Look at this crane As if about to take off to the sky Ahh really ?? Goryeo Celadon true cultural heritage How much is this worth? Appreciate this cultural heritage That in itself doesn't make sense But because of my profession If you insist on setting a price for this job -Maybe worth ... yes, 50,000 yuan-50,000 yuan, correct Who?

Goguryeo tomb style From stone graves to closed ground graves Develops over time Where do we want the mural Namely in a rock-covered grave room When I gave an explanation You should focus and write notes I'm listening I'm focused I am listening very carefully In short, most of the stone space graves were covered in dirt Placed near the Pyongyang or Yalu rivers Are we going to North Korea? Really crazy Yes, North Korea needs reunification before we go there After all, it is very easy to approach the tomb with frescoes Namely the ancient cemetery in Ji'an, China This will be the excavation site for the Goguryeo expedition What a ridiculous Goguryeo expedition Yoon Sehee is in charge of transportation methods and customs I am responsible for entering the grave Doctors are responsible for destroying the mural Really good !!

I don't like the looks I don't like the doctor's appearance either Just work together There They put guards By the way, how do you plan to enter the cemetery? Just find the entrance The entrance to the Goguryeo Tumulus It is closest to the ground How can I find it? I can't dig up all of them Just taste it Because the land won't lie Are you an earthworm? Why eat poop all night? What flavor are you looking for? Bad body odor The smell of corpses? Have you ever eaten a corpse? Hey, youâ€¦ -Dig in here -Ok! There are Police! Get down! I'm nervous to continue this If caught, sentenced to death, I lay there I found it The smell of corpses Now it's my turn to play Goguryeo frescoes Usually coated with chalk for painting Because it's been placed underground for a long time Very sensitive to temperature and humidity Looking at it this way, let's just destroy everything Spray the stabilizer on the surface before cutting Dig around the mural lines with a wire saw Use a wire saw to cut the mural Currently the wire saw should use diamond saw blades Put the motor on both sides Cut it neatly Watch Out Good hard work What are you doing? I'll take the mural This person has watched too many films This is in the real world, where are you going to sell it? Bro, he's not kidding! You have done something wrong The police won't let you go when they hear gunfire Money here can make anything Who sent you here? Know who it is. Is it safer for you to die?

Would you not ask a question like that? Are you alright? I'm fine and I brought a mural here Is that true? Where did you get that fake? Don't think what you get from China is fake You are also Chinese, why are you so unpatriotic? Be careful with your mouth I will confirm its authenticity The main representative cannot give an opinion Just saying Maybe the master was watching from behind -Transaction harder today -Campret !! If you break like this, you will be scolded by the owner Hello, dog owners You have to pay when I get the goods Otherwise, I will destroy it My name is Jones This is the Chairman who can eat Namdaemun in one bite The aura is just amazing How about that You can feel it as soon as you see this little piece, right? Lord Yoon will be grateful Left hand delivery, right hand take money This is the rule I don't care, pack it all up I will return to China Young man you are rude Usually the tricks of the liars are the same Throw something And stab in the back while doing big things But this time you stabbed it a little deep You really bastard, don't fuck much! Mister Kang Dongjiu, what do you mean? This person is very attractive Brave and talkative What? Am I recognized by the President now?

Do you have money to pay for gas and insurance? -So what happened? -The opponent doesn't let go of his weapon I make fast moves Toku If only regular speed Dongjiu, it must be dead I come from the special forces Your story is as fun as the action movie itself I don't see any of that Of course you don't see Because it happens instantly in the dark I understand, that's what happened Dr. Jones Now it's time to make the next film Well the next film Where is the location? Just say it ! Pyramid? Angkor Wat? Macchu Picchu? Sunling Sunling? Sunling in the Gangnam? Are you really going to go inside? How to enter? Get in well Grave robbers like Jiang Dongjiu It's impossible not to know that during the Japanese Imjin chaos Now Sunling What will you do when you enter? Go to an empty grave without corpses The Japanese think there is treasure in the grave Excavated But I didn't find anything there After North Korea respected Confucianism They will not bury luxury items in graves So the hot Japanese Because I burned Chengzong's body You know very well But others don't understand There is actually some good stuff there What is going on over there? Chuan Mito When Li Chenggui returned to being a soldier from Waihua Island The sword was held high in his hand The Joseon version of the King's Sword The sword is in the museum now It was a clone made by Taizong Li Fangyuan I'm talking about the real Chuan Yudao Which was covered in Taizu Li Chenggui's fingerprints The sword killed Queen Yu in legend And disappeared after being crushed Legends are just legends In fact, the secret of the royal family's treasure has been passed down After the Japanese Imjin Rebellion When rearranging the burning tomb of Chengzong To calm his spirit in the sky Bury the sword that symbolizes the standing of North Korea in the coffin That's the fact If it's a fact, you have to present evidence That's easy, Chief It's straight to the point Where did you get this file? Oops, Chairman I heard that the company is hiding their name Enter other people with anonymous resumes Is birth or hometown important? Better to have credibility Correct? This is a doctrine written by Seonjo himself. Through King Taejo's sword Fill the funeral at Seolling It is also not recorded in the "Five Royal Ceremonies" How could that be written in the books that Mao and Agou read If it's a leak I'm afraid someone will rob the grave again Xuan Zu Ling Li, Cao San Shu Shen Xishou Deliver this doctrine in secret I couldn't believe it until I saw this document You have worked hard How do you plan to get it? Are you afraid that I will gamble without chips? I am ready to listen and watch Do you want me to showdown first? That won't work Chuanyudao's level is extraordinary The most valuable treasure from the Joseon Dynasty Can't just leave it to anyone? What do you want to say in the end? I sold a painting by Jin Hongdao several years ago The buyer hangs it in his bedroom But accidentally burned I made up my mind Even though money is important, I don't want to put cultural heritage on it Just give it to Xiaomin Especially Chuan Yudao is no ordinary treasure -At least for the ready customers. -Want a glass of red wine? You want me to taste what expensive red wine? This is collected by year Oh my gosh It's really amazing here Professor Hongjun Yu must see this I have to write another cultural heritage survey There are more relics underground than above ground Finally immortalized here you are So happy to see Buddha again But you don't collect them just to keep track of the rewards Some will appear in the world when the time comes It took 10 years before the statute of limitations to sell. Good fix What is this? I heard it had been burned by fire This is Yu Rong King Sejong, right? It's not really the same as 10,000 faces Wait, a bit like me, don't you think? Take a look Here is a collection of the life history of our country Where did you collect all this from? You're quite smart, huh Real white porcelain exudes natural beauty Where did you get this? Where it comes from does not matter, ask good things Yes, I once said, can not ask hometown Who are you? Why are you approaching me? It was the chairman who approached me The person who wants to steal my Buddha statue is you Asked me to knock down the Goguryeo mural Also under your command Why do you want to look here? I just said that in terms of storage ... Your body can be stored here forever I want to say if there is anything that can be stolen Isn't that the grave robber? So is there anything special here? Looking at the security system, I won't be able to enter Even if you told me to come in and let me go in Korea I'm afraid it's not that easy Rather than betting life here Better to go to Sunreung to get a royal sword Now believe me? I don't believe in grave robbers like you! I only believe in my collection Right, I am relieved to see this You are indeed qualified to become a Chuan Yudao master That shouldn't be yours Bring Chuan Yudao here Good But the price is a bit expensive -How much do you want? -100 million Plus a hundred Is it expensive? This is the sword of the Joseon King The man with the sword can rule the world You are the chairperson of the Cultural Heritage Foundation I should know that time is running out The land will soon dig up Sunling The government will make repairs on July 1 This is because the Sunneung area is very often inundated by water I want to take this opportunity to repair underground pipes And check for damage inside Sunling This is the official construction goal But rumors of the ruling party fell his approval ratings They planned a history And the electoral strategy to advance the national spirit Then why dig up Xuanling first? Does the government also know about this sword? Before the election Find the sword that symbolizes the founding of North Korea Played a great symbolic role for the ruling party Tell the grave robbers to do it Fully support what is needed Yes, sir ! But does the sword have such a value? Isn't that just a rusty sword? Guangzhe, that is no ordinary knife To make Lee Sung-gye the King of Korea Legendary sword If you can get hold of that sword The President will become a legendary protagonist You guys monitor the grave robber Don't let him mess around Yes, ready sir! How? Is this studio space spacious? Still smaller than my room But only you can use this Since when did you change? The meaning? When I got lost Me? I won the good deeds award at school -You never really respond well ...- Hush! This is my favorite song Wu Xijun the singer Do you know this song too? Shut up! If the sword isn't there, you will die! You will die if you don't get it Wouldn't you kill me if you brought him back? {\ an8} (A new start here) Uncle Is that monster shovel uncle?

Disappeared since mine closed Come back later The excavation is said to have been less than a month Across the street from my bedroom You dig 500 meters yourself Steal oil from the pipe Uncle's shovel is legendary 650 meters to be exact It took 21 days and 11:35 am If the Olympics have a tunnel project This older brother can win a gold medal Who told you about me? You're famous, sir I heard from other than the Police Do you live in the mountains digging tunnels? Come on, come on! You invite the wrong people, I don't dig the ground anymore Is this uncle really a shovel expert? His arms were thin and his stomach was rather large Shovel monster? I thought it was weird I just confirmed it The mining industry reported that he was dead Now the name remains Do you want me to introduce a woman? What? Hey Uncle! Do you really want to get in the car? Give him a way Why can't this door be opened? You just jumped? Cultural Assets Bureau restoration project Construction will start on July 1 Only a month and a half from now First, find a place to dig a tunnel It's not easy to find I guarantee you won't leak construction noise -Close to the location of Seolleung -Great !! When I'm willing to give you a little more royalties Isn't it better to close it quickly? It is very close to the subway station There are many restaurants nearby and parks Even though this is semi-basement, look sir! Bright light This price is near Xuanling station You won't be able to find a house this good This is suitable because you have a good impression I just sold it to you But will you live in this house alone? Isn't there a wife? Correct I live alone Good Everyone enter They are employees of our company This is Agency Boss What company are you? Sunneung will be built soon. That's our responsibility Did your job fix Sunreung? Are you a good person? Incidentally if you are here during the rainy season Housing prices fell due to flooding It's really sad That's why we're coming You will be better here One month remains before construction begins at Seoulling From the bottom of the building to the inside of Seolling Tunnel length of 200 meters Dig at least 7 meters every day To shorten the time {\ an8} (Goguryeo Expedition Team) I will dig a drainage pipe in Sunreung Park Along the sewer Go to the place closest to Sunreung Dig from there to Seolling The coffee shop on the first floor posted info on interior decoration And it works only at night Adjust to hotel working hours Someone is ready at the door to answer; already full It's full, please come back. -What? Help back To prevent construction noises from being heard outside Always keep the volume up Dugouts Taken transportation via an internal hallway to the coffee shop on the first floor Transported naturally like decoration waste Seol's tomb was more difficult to excavate than the other tombs Refurbished because it doesn't want to be stolen again The outer wall protects the coffin Lime is stronger than concrete After we dissolve chalk with chemicals There will be granite protecting the graves There is no point hitting it with a hammer Because it is surrounded by 80 cm thick granite There should be a door to insert the coffin, right? The entrance door has also been closed with lime and granite Usually the thinnest place is the bottom I never expected to dig from the bottom before But what about a drill? Because it's not easy to dig from underground Bombed !! -Why are you surprised ?! What if the treasure above was also detonated? President Chen will definitely love you very much, right? What would you do? Don't worry, I have my own way Before the wall of fate, you were indifferent in the skyâ€¦ At the end of my life Smile day Walk with me I'm not here to play Next time OK, OK What a cheapskate you are!
