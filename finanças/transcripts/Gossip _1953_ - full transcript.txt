GOSSIP Pretty clever birds the parrot they can actually talk pronounce words of course they have no idea what the word means. So we never take them seriously. Unfortunately that's not true. With got them they use words just as carelessly as the Pirates but sometimes we take them seriously and offer an innocent person the time. You think the don't stop to think but where the things they influence our national life and in the war. They are a powerful weapon got to parse words around the perilously but no more sense of the harm that can and I heard somebody say gossiping is monopolized by women far from anyone who used the word carelessly especially Poppy Harlow someone fact that the got a little story about a guy. This is Marion Hi my school. I'm the principal George Eastman there were some people at my office this particular morning Mr and Mrs Gage on their daughter Jane. They told me Jane would have to leave school. Why because of the malicious gossip about it. I was shocked and I asked for details to see if we could do something about it. We began putting even though Jane thought it was already too late. Let's burn Mrs Gates would open the grocery store at the start of the purse and helped out after her. Usually it's difficult for a boy or girl entering a new school to get acquainted make friends but in jeans case it was easy to get very good on her first drawing want to school award and the prize winning picture was posted on the bulletin board. That's a new over the doors for the all the girls were in the pit anxious to meet. The first friend she made was Janice Nelson. of course Marion private co-educational and the other half of our student body is always interested in the pretty popular new girl song while Jean new friend Janice Nelson was introducing her to some of the other girls the black one. Roland Bill Alice are to writing Cazenove as we're making a little bet. At the which would make the first date with her. Below us made the first move. It was waiting on the set when Dennis and Jean left school that afternoon and soon was off to a running start in the competition. What we call the best broken field runner in Merion history for nothing beside the still had some props in the van. Like an open convertible. But it helped quite a few times in the past. Bill didn't know it yet but he was about to be outmaneuvered by it all break the fake black wire. Jack was well a lead now he drove twelve blocks out of his way to drop generous offers. Then he took his son getting Gene back to the grocery store. They didn't produce Jack to a mother and father and presto he'd won. He had a date with Jane for by the night of the time Jack called for her and all during the afternoon and evening Jean kept thinking to itself how lucky she was that her father had moved the story here. So she could have him out there with a brand new student that already had won the art contest made a whole circle of friends had been asked to put her. Girls Club and now here she was out with the most popular boy in school. But when they brought home clean began to learn a little more about Jack. Its popularity had gone to his head he was completely sure of themselves confident that none of the girls had resistance. Gene left didn't hurt his face but it certainly injured his pride to drive a laugh it off but he was thinking that he'd have to get even. Jack didn't lose any time giving the other boys a highly colored version of the bait. To regain a self-confidence and build themselves up and there I was the added a few details remarks about being completely on the crew then got to sell them worry about the proof. Now the gospel began to spread colored a little more and passed it on them because the matter is both over first to use our lunch hour to tell a story to every girl who would listen and that included practically every girl in the school. When she got home she took over the telephone call. Although she'd missed. Yes got the spreads like wildfire. Especially with the help of girls like Christine. And by the end of the day the harm was done. Jane reputation was ruined the next morning Christine. Still wasn't through she'd been jealous of the new girl's popularity and talent from the start now with a chance. But the picture gave Gina her first inkling that something was wrong. You knew it had been torn down deliberately. To ask your friend Janet that she'd done something wrong but Janet was too I'm comfortable embarrassed to tell James Webb Space. Everyone took pains to ignore her she felt like an outsider couldn't imagine why Gene was a person B. Will they marry. Hi It seemed so wonderful. Only last week now. It was like a completely different school gossip. Jane was lonely and miserable all week but she was still hopeful that once she was initiated into the girls' club things would be better. However Jean had already been blackballed even before the club got under how to start it but instead of pulling the club president had made James assignments far more difficult than the other girls hoping Jane would fail that's the qualifying yourself. Not knowing this James started out on the scavenger hunt as eagerly as any of the others. He was willing to work twice as hard as the other pledges the be initiated. The rest of the pledges and finish their assignments and been notified of that acceptance before Gene returned. Now the girls were really about Jean came back with every one of our assignments completed. What could she do next. Nothing christenings older she'd been blackballed she wasn't wanted. Jane couldn't understand she'd done our assignments as well as any of them. Why had she been rejected for things that Jane knew very well. Why because they didn't want her kind of girl in their club didn't build it and understand. Janice finally had to explain that they all knew about her about Jack's story Jeanne with Don How could anybody believe that about her. When Mr and Mrs de jure Paymah home game told them what had happened but she hadn't been accepted by the club because of the gossip about it she thought she was quitting school. So that's the story she told me that's where the gauges came to see me they agreed with Jean it would be better if she left school but I asked them to wait. Give me a chance to do what I could gossip is difficult to fight. You have to go right to the source and stamp it out. That's exactly what I did I called him Jack one role asked him point blank if he was the God that Jack was surprised he thought only women gods of man just well talk. He admitted he'd start of the park but he never realized the harm it would do when I finished explaining what his loose pocket done to Jean Jacques asked me what he could do and I told him the way the only way he thought it over it wasn't going to be easy it would be embarrassing and we both knew it but he finally agreed to give Jack credit he went through with it is voice broke a few times but he managed to tell them all that there was nothing to the gossip that he had made up the story and was to blame for everything but that wasn't quite right. I told him but anyone who listens the gossip is almost as much to blame as the person who spread that we were going to discuss the problem of the family make the whole school aware of the danger and make sure that no American student whatever again be hurt the way Gene was. The next day the whole student body realized what they had done the gene. Now they wanted to make it up to it. She made a fresh start. It was still one of my and most popular girls one of our real leaders. What could have been another got the project they had been a happy ending but don't forget that. There needn't have been so much as a near tragedy of our students instead of imitating this bird because the big parrot had instead copied three far wiser creatures the three little monkeys who see no evil hear no evil and speak no evil.
