- Hurry up, Auggie, ugh. Auggie, hurry it up, time is short! - Yeah, I'm coming. - August. - This is just great. - Stop playing games! We've got work to do, come on! - I hate this place! Dad? Keeper. - There, what is it, Auggie? - What are we doing here? A man could get killed in this storm. - Yes, he could. That's exactly why we're here. Now, come on, get inside. No power. - Of course, there's no power. - Oh, just a loose bulb. - Let's get outta here. - Auggie, do I need to remind you that our family have been the harbor masters and the lighthouse keepers in Owl's Point for... - Five generations, I know. - And you, you Auggie, are the sixth. - I got a sixth sense that aint gonna happen. - You don't know what you're talking about. - We're here for the tourists, to show them what life used to be. Dad, we're actors. Dad, let me help. - I'll get the light. - But... - Just stay here. - I've got your ticket out of here. I said, I got your ticket out of here. Chicago to L.A., nonstop. - Rhonda, hi. - Is something wrong, August? - No, I was just thinking about... - Thinking of a way to thank me for being the only manager that could get you out of the national tour of the show that you made a Broadway hit to get you to L.A. in time to star in the movie based on the show that you made a Broadway hit. - Rhonda, you read my mind. - There's no need to thank me. It's my pleasure. Besides, the 30% interest I own in you is all the thanks I need. You leave for L.A. tonight. - Tonight? Why tonight? - Why not tonight? - Rhonda, you know how I feel about flying. - Did I mention your ticket is First Class? - I just wanted one last night to celebrate with the cast. Give me one good reason why we need to leave tonight. - I'll give you three good reasons. The Terry Parsons Show booked you for tomorrow afternoon. You're the featured guest on Spotlight Tonight tomorrow night, and you're scheduled for lunch with Gerald Winfrow. - Who? - The writer of the movie. - Writer? I've been doing this role for seven years. I can do the part in my sleep. The fact is, I probably have. - Exactly why we need to get out of here. We need to change. No more dirty, old, disgusting, run-down theaters. Hollywood, August. Sunshine, swimming pools. - Movie stars. - Movie stars. - And here comes the next big thing. August Starr... - Curtain in 10 minutes, August. Oh, hello, Rhonda. - Terry. - Thanks, Tony. Who died? - You did, kind of. The cast and the crew, they wanted to... - "To August Star, the brightest star of them all. "See you on the red carpet." - How witty. - Thank everybody for me. - We love you, man. - It's been great run. - We loathe you, ma'am. - Good riddance, Timmy. - Tony. - Hm? - Oh, hey, huh? - What's this for? - Sign the wall. - Hey, Timmy, move out of the way. - No. Always reach for the stars. I'll catch you on stage. - Maybe I should finish the tour. - Maybe you should leave decisions like that to me. - Really, Rhonda? When is your contract up? - Ah! - Excuse me! - Oh. - August, we need to talk. - Not now, Rhonda. I have a show to do, remember, acting? It's what got us here in the first place. - August. - Later, Rhonda. - August? August? - August! - Hey! - August, what's going on? - I'm fine. I'm just tired. You told me I had a month before the movie started. - You do. - I was planning some time off. - You're kidding, right? Do you know how hard it was to book you on the Parsons Show? You're not exactly a household name, not yet. - Great, then let's wait until I am. - Hey, but it's not gonna happen unless you do the Parsons Show. August, hey! - Rhonda! - August! - August! August! - Sh! - Okay, hey, hey! You know I only have your best interests at heart. Okay, fine, and my 30%. - Rhonda, I appreciate everything. Really, I do. You work hard. Thank you, but I work hard, too. I need some time. Hey. - Hey Auggie, ready for sound? - Yep, ready for sound. - All right. - Let's get this thing done. - I appreciate all the flowers you guys sent me. That was really nice. - All right. - Testing, one, two, three. - All right, you're good. - Thanks, Bobby. - You bet. - Time off, sure. No problem. - Yeah right. - August, you're right. It's been a long run. You need to rest. - I do! - My first job will be to schedule you a nice, longer vacation. - Really? - At least a weekend, a long weekend. - Rhonda! - But first, there's this. - What is this? - Your scheduled appearances for the next... - Two weeks? - Sh! - I didn't agree to any of this. - Yes, we did. Remember, what's hot today can just as easily become what's not tomorrow. I'm here to make sure that doesn't happen. - If you change your mind, let me know. My number's on the bottom. - Yeah, I will Tony. - One minute August. - Thanks Kim. What's that about? - My cousin. He moves specialty cars. I was gonna take next week off and drive that down to Vegas to a client of his, but someone who shall remain nameless decided to quit the show. So I requested to stay here and help the new guy for the first week. - Sorry. Sweet ride though. - It is. And my cousin isn't one for taking no. Hey! Hey kid, you old enough to go to Vegas? Forget that, you old enough to drive? - 20 seconds. - Tony! - Cue in five! - Okay, okay! - And this. - Nice car! - Yeah, thanks. Hey, do me a favor. Keep an eye on it for a few minutes. - Yeah, sure, thanks! - Waitress. - Waitress? It's worse than that, I own the place. - Sorry. - Can I help you? - Kate is it? - Great deduction. - Kate, I'll have a skinny caramel latte with two shots of espresso. - Decaf or regular? - Regular. Thank you. Yeah. - Where are you? - Good morning to you too boss. - The limo service that was sent to pick you up at LAX says you weren't on the plane. - Yeah, that's correct. Well, didn't I tell you? - Tell me what? - I'm driving to Vegas. - Vegas? - Mm-hm. Yeah, I'm in... Excuse me, where am I? - Cedar Creek, Iowa. - Iowa. - I-O what? - Listen, as soon as I make the delivery for Tony... - Tony. Okay, I knew he would be messed up in this. What about the Parsons show? - You'll figure something out. I'll be in Vegas in two days, three maybe. After I make the drop, I'll head to L.A., promise. - Look, you listen to me, you get yourself... - Rhonda, you're cutting out. I think it's a bad connection. - Don't give me that. I know you can hear me perfectly well. - Rhonda I'll call ya back when better signal... - August! - Look, I just told you, two to three days at the most! Just leave me alone! - Am I speaking to August Star? - Who's asking? - This is Amanda Benson. The administrator at the Owl's Nest Nursing Home. - What did he do now? - Excuse me? - Did he escape again? - As a matter of fact, yes. - How far did he get this time? - To the harbor. - You guys really need a better security system. - Mr. Star, I'm sorry to inform you that there has been a significant deterioration in your father's condition. - Oh. What do you mean? - It's safe to say that tomorrow won't be as good as today. He keeps asking for you. - For me? - I'm assuming you're Auggie? - Used to be. - If there is any way you could find the time to come visit your father, I would recommend you do it now. Mr. Star? - Yeah. I'm... Looks, thanks for the call. - Hello? Hello? - Would you like a warm-up? - No. No thank you. Keep the change. - Come back again real soon. - Later Rhonda. Hey! Hey, do you know how to get to Owl's Point Wisconsin? - Oh, yeah, yeah! So what you're gonna do is you're gonna take this road down to Highway 151 North, and then get onto I-43 North and just keep going. If you hit water, you've gone too far. - All right, thanks bud. - Yeah, no problem. - Yeah, this is August, please leave a message. - Oh, I'll leave a message all right. - 911, please state the nature of your emergency. - Yes, I would like to report a missing actor. - Stop! - Is everything all right? - Not exactly! - Good, none of it spilled on the car. - What! Thanks for your concern! - Sorry, it's not mine. - I see. - Oh, are you all right? - I'm fine. - Let me buy you some replacement coffees. It's the least I can do. - You're August Star. - Yeah, I am. - I thought you looked familiar. - I'd like to keep it quiet that I'm here. - Maybe I should have got hit. "Celebrity takes out local resident." What a headline. - Look, let's pretend this never happened. - I see. Money solves all ones problems. - It doesn't hurt. - It's nice to see you again, Auggie. - Do I know you? - Probably not, but I know you. - Wait! Who are you? - I'm Mandy, Kirkwood. Roger's little sister. - Oh! Mandy! How are you? - Well, for nearly being run over by a car, not bad. - You were what? In seventh grade when we were seniors? - Yeah, that sounds about right. - What's Roger up to these days? - He owns a marine dealership down on Sturgeon Bay. - That figures. - Well, he always liked the water. Not like some people we know. - Who? Me? - Roger said you couldn't wait to get off Owl's Point. - Can you blame me? Other than some summer stock theater and the state park, there isn't much opportunity for an actor around here. - I heard you're making the jump from stage to screen, congratulations. - Thanks. I'm on my way to L.A. now. - Owl's Point is sort of a round about way to Hollywood, wouldn't you say? It's nice to see you again. - Wait. Let my buy you lunch. - I just ate. - Okay, coffee than. I owe you. - Thanks, but I'm already late and you are procrastinating. Auggie, go see your Dad. - How do you know I'm here to see my Dad? - I work at the Owl's Nest Nursing Home. - Really? Let me give you a ride. - The Nest is right down the street. - Well then, let me walk with you. - It's a free sidewalk. - Same old Owl's Point. - Yup. They're gonna change the lighthouse into an observation tower. - Really? - Yup. Gonna replace the light with the tower viewer. - A what? - You know one of those things you put money into to look through to... - Oh, yeah! Wow. - Keeper isn't happy about it. - I bet not. - So how long has it been since you've been back? - A few years. Maybe six or seven. After the show closed on Broadway, we took it on tour. I haven't had much time off. - I see. - Besides, there hasn't been a whole lot of reason to come back. - What about Keeper? - Keeper? My Dad and I don't exactly see eye to eye. - Well how do you know when you haven't been here to look him in the eye? - Let's just say that my departure from Owl's Point did not meet with his approval. After all, who'd wanna give up all this for life as an actor? - Is that a rhetorical question? - Don't get me wrong, Owl's Point is great for some people. - For uninspired people like me. - Didn't you ever wanna see what's out there? What's out beyond that lighthouse? - Tell me, August the Star, what's out there? What's out there that can't be found right here? - To each their own. - And who are your own? The paparazzi? Fanatic fans, the suffocating crowds? - Don't knock it til you try it. - What about the people who really love you? - Really love me? What's, what's real? Real is what you pretend real to be. I'm an actor remember? - What about Keeper? He is real. - I pay for his care. - That's right, money solves all ones problems. - It's a lot more than some people do. Look, my Dad's nickname is more than accurate. Especially when it comes to me. He saw his duty was not only keeping that lighthouse, but keeping me locked in it at all costs. Even at the cost of my happiness. Is that love? - So you were abused? - Just detained. - Maybe Keeper thought he knew what was best for you. We all make mistakes. - And some of us are able to admit to those mistakes. - Maybe the apple didn't fall far from the lighthouse. - Maybe this walk wasn't such a good idea. - Then maybe it's a good thing we have arrived at the end of the line. Hi Carol. - Hello, how are you? - It's nice to see you again August. - Nice to see you Mandy. - You'll find Keeper's room down the hall and to the right. Don't forget to sign in and sanitize your hands. - So, what are you? A secretary or something? - Something like that. Goodbye Auggie. Afternoon ladies. - Amanda. Mandy, of course she'd be the boss. - Sorry, excuse me. - Hey Dan. - Oh, hi ladies. - Dad? Dad? - Oh, he's sleeping. - Oh, I'm sorry. I thought he was alone. - I'm Mike, our caregiver. Keeper's one of my regulars. You must be August. - How did you know? - You just called him Dad. - Right. - It's nice to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. - Really? Anything you can repeat? - Well, actually all of it. I heard about your many fishing excursions for bass. Right, your sailing adventures to Willow Island, and oh, your hunts buried pirate treasure along the shore. And how you and Keeper worked together protecting the coast by making sure the light never went out. - That was a long time ago. - Not to Keeper. To him, it happened yesterday. What is it? - Do we know each other? You look familiar. - Well, maybe for the fact that I was witness to you nearly turning the center's Administrator into a speed bump. - That's it! You were the guy that ran in the middle of the road. - You seemed distracted. - Yeah, well, I thought I... You didn't see a man and a boy in raincoats sitting outside the ice cream parlor did you? - Well, I can't say I did. Why? - Nevermind. I'll come back later. - Why later? - When he's awake. - What you see is what you get. - Really? - Pretty much. When you sleep 20 hours a day, losing 15 minutes is not gonna make a big difference. Keeper. - Keeper! - Keeper wake up. I have a surprise for you. - What is it? - Look who's here. - It's about time. What took him so long? - Well better late than never, right Keeper? - What's for dinner? - Lasagna, your favorite. Maybe August can join you. - Auggie! Where is he? - I'm right here. It's good to see you again Dad. - What's going on here? - It's me, August, Auggie. - I don't know you. - Keeper, it's your son. - That's not my son. Auggie's at school. - Keeper, August drove all this way... - I told you, that is not Auggie! - It's okay Mike. - Get him out of here! - But Keeper... - Look at him what's wrong with you! - I better leave. - Good, get out! Out! - Come back later, August, these things take time. He'll be fine when he calms down. - Sure. See ya Mike. - Why did you let him in here? - I'm sorry Keeper. - That's not Auggie. Auggie's at school! - I know. - What's for dinner? - Lasagna. - Oh, my favorite. - Sir, don't forget to sign out. - August, stop playing games! We got work to do, come on! - I hate this place. - Excuse me. Excuse me. - Oh, hi. Can I help you? - May I have your autograph? - My autograph? - Yes please. - Sure, I'd be happy to sign. What's your name? - Olivia. - Olivia. To Olivia, always reach for the stars. There ya go. - August Star, oh. - What is it? - I thought you were famous. - Famous huh? Who told you that? - My Mom. - Where is she? That's your Mom? - Yeah. Can I go play with my friends now? - Sure. Stay away from the water. - Okay! - Here, let me take your pen and notebook. - Thanks. You're a pretty good guy, for a nobody. - Thanks. Yup, definitely related. No doubt about it. An autograph? - Oh, I didn't want you to feel like a fish out of water here in little old Owl's Point. I know how much you show people you crave attention. - We do? - Yeah, you do. - That was my manager's doing. - Oh. Of course. How was your visit with Keeper? - Good. - Really? - Yeah. - You're not gonna win any awards with that performance. - All right, it could have gone better. - For who, you or Keeper? - Excuse me? - You haven't been here in how long? - So my leaving caused this? - No, this would've happened to Keeper if you were here or not. But Auggie, you haven't been in his life in a long time, have you? - I suppose not much. - Listen, this isn't a scientific explanation, but it may help you understand what your Dad is going through. Picture the brain as a head of lettuce. Memories from the past are in the center of the head, and the more recent memories are the leaves on the outside. And as you peel those leaves away, those memories just... - Disappear. - Yeah. Keeper does remember you Auggie, but to him you're a teenager. - And your daughter? - What about her? - Olivia's Dad. Mr. Benson I presume? - You presume correctly. - How long have you been married? - Next month, it would have been 11 years. - So he left you? - He left me when his Humvee ran over an IED on a desert road in Afghanistan. Rob was deployed five months before Olivia was born. They never got a chance to meet each other. Listen, I knew what I was doing when I married the Army, and I would do it all over again. Besides, Rob and Olivia aren't the parent and child we need to talk about right now. - Let's not go there. - Listen, I have an idea. - Hm, what kind of an idea? - A good one. At least I think it could possibly be a good one. Maybe. - That's reassuring. - Just listen. - I'm listening. - Miracles do happen. - Nice. - Just promise me that you will drive that fancy car of yours over to the Owl's Nest and nine a.m. tomorrow. - But I'm... - Promise? - All right, I promise. - Great. I'll see you tomorrow. August, where are you staying? - Frankly, I haven't thought that far ahead. - Here, take these. - You're okay with me staying at your place? - Those are Keeper's keys to his house. Your home Auggie. - You know, maybe staying at your place wasn't such a bad idea? - What's the matter, are you uncomfortable? - Well... - Auggie, sometimes you have to be uncomfortable to be comfortable. See you tomorrow. Nine a.m. - Right! Hey Mandy! - What! - What's the second key for? - I don't know. I'll see you tomorrow. - Is there anything else I should do? - No, let's just let the situation play out for now. - Very well. - Mike. Time is short. - I understand. - Tony! Tony, I know you're in here. Get out here this instant! This is ridiculous! Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony? - Hey Rhonda. - What kind of trouble have you gotten August into? - Trouble, no? There is no trouble. He was supposed to take the car and drop it off in Vegas like we planned. - You and your plan. Turn that light off. Who's that with you? - Where is August? - Iowa. - Iowa? He should be further than that by now. - Who are you? - Nobody, just a concerned party. And where in Iowa might we find Mr. Star? - This morning he was in Cedar Creek, but he hasn't responded to any of my calls since. Wait. You don't think there was an accident? You don't think he's hurt, do you? - If not, it could be arranged. - What? - Why don't we continue this conversation somewhere else? - No, I think I'll stay here. Tony, hey! Let go of me! Tony! Tony! Tony! Let go of... - Well it's time! Roger's here to take me to the station. - Auggie, I don't like this. - Of course you don't Dad. But for me, it's now or never. - But you know this show could end tomorrow. - You're right. And I would've never had a chance to be a part of it. - Auggie... - Dad, look, I know you think I only got the part of an understudy, but this is a legitimate way into the theater. And who knows, maybe it could lead to my big break. - Well I know, but, what about the light? - You got it covered Dad. Come on. I'll call you when I get there. See ya Dad! - Bye Auggie. - Take that! And that! And that! Never! - Ho! - You'll never take me ship! - Never? Then Captain, welcome to never. - Aye, a feisty one are ya! Whoa! Ow! - Dad, are you okay? - Ouch! Hey, what was that for? - Just a lesson Auggie. Never lower your guard. - Ouch! - Have at ya! - Never! - All right, okay. You know, this is one fine ship Auggie. - It's the best one yet! - You know, I believe it is. So, what are you gonna do when she's finished? - I'm gonna sail away from Owl's Point. - Why? - To find adventure. - Ah. Well then, maybe we better not be in such a rush to finish it. So, how was school today? - Fine. - Fine? Didn't anything interesting happen? - Does anything interesting ever happen here? - Well listen, how about after supper we play... - Homework. I've got a report to do. I'm gonna eat in my room and get at it. - All right. Did you say your prayers? - Yes, I said my prayers. - Good, always remember, check in God when you first wake up, when you go to bed, and many times during the day. You promise? - Promise. - Good. All right. Hey, how about a quick round of the question game before you turn in? - I should get to bed. - One round, for old times sake? - All right. - Good good. I'll start. Thinking. Thinking. I'm thinking. Okay, I got one. - Is it a thing? - Yes. - Is it on Owl's Point? - Oh, you're good. - Is it tall? - Only the tallest. - Dad. - Come on, keep going. - Is it the church steeple? - No it is not the church steeple. - Is it bright? - When it needs to be. - It's the lighthouse. - How did you know? - Because it's always the lighthouse. - Oh no, not always. I mean, sometimes it's the lantern room. - The lantern room is in the lighthouse. - True. True. Okay, your turn. - I can't think of anything. - I don't believe that. - All right, I got it. - Okay. Is it a thing? - No. - Is it a person. - Yup. - Are they living? - I don't know. - Man? - No. - Woman? - Uh-huh. - Is she living in Owl's Point? - Not anymore. - Do you know her? - That's a no. - Boy, you're right, it is getting late. I think we should... - Don't you wanna know the answer? - You were thinking about your mother. - Where is she? - Honestly, Auggie, I do not know. - Why would she leave us? I was just a baby. - I know you were. But she... - I hate her. As much as she must hate me. - No, no, no, no, no, Auggie. Don't hate her, if anything, pray for her. - Pray? For her? - Yes. Pray that God brings his light into her life. Come on Auggie, after all, she gave us something really special. - And what's that? - Each other. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Oh, you ready to blow out the lamp? Okay. One, two, three! - Who in their right mind plays the lute? Auggie's shows? What? What in the world? Oh come on. Give me a signal. Oh, there we go. Rhonda, hey, this is August. Listen, I need a few days, something's come up. I'm at home in Owl's Point, Wisconsin. Do me a favor and tell Tony I'm gonna be a few days late delivering the car to Vegas. I'll fill you in on the details later. I... See ya. - Owl's Point, why? - That's the question of the day. Seems like a good place to hide. I gotta tell your cousin. - Cousin! - Ow! Hey, why? Why would you do that? - You sent August out in a hot car! - Whoa, the car ain't hot. - The car isn't hot... - It's the contraband that's hidden in the car. That's hot. - See, the contraband is... Oh boy. - What contraband? - You two stay put. - Take your time. What's so funny? - I love this place, I love my job. - Stop messing around! Your cousin? We're being held hostage by your cousin? Nice family. - Listen Rhonda, I didn't know anything about any contraband. You have to believe me. - Yeah right. - And, in fact, if we be in it'd be safer for all of us if we didn't know. - Safer for all of us? What do you mean? - Well let's just hope that August doesn't stumble upon whatever is in that car. - So help me Tony, if we get out of this alive, I'm going to kill you. - Sit down. - Today's your lucky day. We're taking a little road trip to Wisconsin. I love cheese curds. - I'm here as promised. - Keeper, I would like you to meet someone. - What's going on? - This is Keeper's day to go for a car ride and he sure appreciates the volunteers who come every week. Don't you keeper? - I don't care. - Oh, don't you wanna see Owl's Point? - I've seen it. Can we go back inside? - Oh come on, it'll be fun. This nice mans name is Harry. - Thanks. - Well Harry, she won't rest until we get this over with. - Tell me about it. - Well what, are 12 clowns gonna jump out of that tin can? - You two have fun. - Hey, Mandy, I was wondering if we could talk? - Sure, what is it? - Not here. I've some questions about Keeper that I was hoping you might be able to shed some light on. - I mean, I really don't know much about him prior to his arrival at the Nest. - Any insight would be appreciated. - Okay. Tell you what, Olivia's staying with a friend tonight, I can meet you at the Bayview restaurant at seven. We could talk then. - Great. It's a date. - Hey, are we going or what? - Yeah, yeah we're going. Where, I don't know. - Well get a map. - I have GPS. - You have what? - I said I have GPS! - He says he has GPS. Is it legal to drive with that condition? Stop! - What? What's wrong? - Not here. At the stop sign at the corner, I didn't want you to miss it. - Thanks. - What are you doing? - I have no idea. - That's what I thought. Harry, what are we doing here? - I thought we'd take a trip down memory lane. - Oh. - When'd you get that? - 1972. - You remember. - It says it right here. Can't you read? "Regional Champions 1972." Boy, I had a 196 average. - That's right, you did. Who made this? - Oh, Auggie and I. Took us two months. - An hour every night. - Right. Auggie must be at school. - Yeah, school. Hey, what are these? - Oh. I don't know. Never seen 'em before, garbage. What are you doing? - I thought we'd take a few things back. - Back where? - Back to your room. - My room is right through that door. Auggie must be at school. - Can't you see Auggie is right... - Harry, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Hey, you know, I think I know where we might be able to find Auggie. - Really? Well, let's go. - Come on, let's go take a look. - What are we doing here? - Looking to see if Auggie is here. - You won't find him here. - Why not? - Auggie hates this place. Oh yeah. Yeah. - Go figure, it burns out right when we walk in. - Oh, you see, right there. Right there is where Auggie said we were just actors. Can you believe it? - Yeah, that's awful. - What'd ya say? - Oh, I just said that maybe Auggie changed his mind. Maybe he doesn't hate this place. Oh. Looks like they started the remodeling. That's right, they took the light out and they're gonna put in an observation deck. - Observation deck? For what? - For tourists. - Tourists? You're crazy. They can't do that. The light's too important. - Times change. - Yeah, yeah. There's something here for Auggie. - What's here? - The light. - I just told you, the light is gone. - Remind me to tell Auggie that it's here. The light is here. Well, come on Harry, let's go. Harry! - Yeah, I'm coming Keeper. Well Keeper, we're back. Did you enjoy your trip? - Well, it wasn't the worst. - Would you like to do it again sometime? - Maybe. - Well, at least that isn't a no. Here, let's make sure you got all your treasures... - Look what you made me do. - Sorry. Here, let me help. - All right. Wait, what's this? - I don't know, what is it? - It's my marbles! I thought I'd lost my marbles. - Can I help you? - Yes, I'm Special Agent Ketchum and this is Agent Howard. We're with the FBI. - Farm Bureau? - Federal Bureau of Investigation. We're looking for someone who may have past through town recently. - Agent Ketchum? You're kidding, right? - I don't understand. - Of course you don't. - We're looking for someone who may have been driving this car. - I didn't see any car. - Well, anybody come in that seemed like he was from out of town? - You mean espresso boy? - Excuse me? - The fella that left you with that $50 tip. - Oh yeah, there was this handsome fella. - He wore a baseball cap and dark sunglasses. - Sunglasses inside. That's odd. - You think? Must've been trying to hide something. - What did he do? - Just drank his coffee. - Anything else? - No, just drank his coffee and talked on the phone the entire time. - To whom? Who did he talk to? - Well, if I recall, the conversation was with somebody he called boss. - Boss? - Said he was going to make a drop in Las Vegas. - Really? Is that all? - Well pretty much. For that call. - There was another call? - Yup. Someone thought it was important that he knew there was an escape. - Escape? Well, thank you. You've been most helpful. - You won't find him in Las Vegas. - And, why not son? - Because I know where he went. - And do you know how to get to Owl's Point Wisconsin? - Oh yeah, yeah. So what you're gonna do is you're gonna take this road down to Highway 151 North. - Evening. - Hi, Mandy Benson? - Yes, Benson right here. - Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late. I wanted to pick these up for you to thank you for everything you've done. - How sweet of you. They're beautiful. But you shouldn't have. - Hey, where are mine? - August, this is Martha. She is a resident at the Owl's Rest Nursing Home. She has known Keeper for many years. - Hi Auggie. - Hi Martha. - Have a seat. Take a load off. - I thought Martha could shed some light on Keeper's life after you left Owl's Point. Here's a menu. - Thanks. Good idea. I guess. - You were right Mandy. - Right about what? - Nothing. - You are even better looking in person. - Really? And so are you Martha. - You dog! Flattery will get you everywhere. - Martha, why don't you take a look at the menu. We should probably choose what we're gonna eat tonight. Although I've suddenly lost my appetite. - Until Keeper started to, well, you know, forget things. He could tell almost anything about marine life on the Great Lakes. - Don't I know it. - He would always say, "I don't have to go see the world."... - The world always comes to see me. - That's right. From his advantage point on top of that lighthouse, he saw the ships from all over the world. He met Captains and their crews. He insists that one time during a full moon... - In 1965, he spied a Russian submarine. Heard it! - Look Auggie, I'm sorry I can't provide you with any new information about Keeper. - I'm sure August appreciates your time and for being a good friend to Keeper. - Yes, I do. Thank you, Martha. It's just that, well, last night, I came across these at Keepers cabin. - They're theater tickets. Unused. - For the opening night of every city I've ever played. - It was nice of you to invite him. - That's just it, I didn't. - How do you think he got them? - I don't know. I don't mean to brag but, most of these tickets sold for a small fortune. - I can see that. - Martha, did Keeper ever mention anything to you about tickets? - Not specifically. - What do you mean, "not specifically?" - I mean, he never mentioned tickets, but he did always know where you were, what show you were in, and how well you did in the reviews. - Power of the internet. - Right. The internet. Keeper? The closest he ever got to a computer was the timer on his coffee maker. And it usually started brewing at three in the morning. No, the net Keeper ever knew was on a fishing boat. - Well, then I guess the case of the unused theater tickets will remain a mystery. Who cares. - It would seem that you do. This place has the best blueberry pie. Are you sure you two don't want a piece? Have you tried contacting Keeper's sister? - What? - Keepers sister. To shed light on the tickets. - Martha, what are you talking about? - Keeper's sister. You know, Auggie's mother. - My mother? - You didn't know that Keeper is actually your Uncle, did you? More coffee please. - All right Keeper of secrets, you've got company. - Sir! Please sign in. - When you sleep 20 hours a day what's 15 minutes of lost rest? Right? All right, let's really test your memory and see what lies you can muster this time. Keeper, it's August! Keeper! Keeper? - Huh? - Keeper, is that you? - Auggie? Watch out for the pirate. - Pirate... - Auggie, hurry it up! Time is short! - I hate this place. - And here comes the next big thing. August Star. Remember, what's hot today can just as easily become what's not, tomorrow. - If there is any time you could come to visit your father, I would recommend you do it now. Owl's Point is sort of a roundabout way to Hollywood, wouldn't you say. Tell me August the Star, what's out there? What's out there that can't be found right? - What's real? Real is what you pretend real to be. - I don't know you. That's not my son. What did he tell you! Get him out of here! - Keeper does remember you, Auggie. But to him you're a teenager. Sometimes you have to be uncomfortable to be comfortable. - You were thinking about your Mother, but she... - I hate her. - You won't find him here. - Why not? - Auggie hates this place. - Keeper's sister. You know, Auggie's Mother. - My Mother? Ow, my head. - Auggie? Auggie is that you? - Where are we? - The lighthouse. Red skies in the morning, sailors take warning. There's a storm a coming. - I think it already hit. - Those pirate friends of yours, they play a little rough. - Pirates? - Not very creative though. The best they could come up with to say was, "Where's the loot? "Where's the loot?" - Where are they? - Well, I told them where the loot was. - Where? - Where else? In my treasure chest. - Hey, what is this? - It's kind of a dumb thing to scavenger for though. I can't remember the last time I played it. - Your lute. - Oh! - Sorry. - Auggie, are you okay? - Why are you calling me Auggie? - Well that's your name. Are we being some kind of characters? Sir Francis Drake? Sir Walter Raleigh how can I be your service. - No, Auggie's fine. - Okay, as you wish sir. - Dad. - Huh? - What happens when the pirates figure out that the loot is your lute? - Well, they, they said something about coming back here to finish the game. I wish they would hurry. It's cold, cold in here. I'm tired. - Hey, hang in there Dad. - I'm so tired. - It's been a long time since I've been up there. - Up where? - The lantern room. - Oh. Not a big fan of lighthouses, are you Auggie? - I wouldn't say that. - I would. - Well, it doesn't help when you have a fear of heights. - A fear of heights? I never knew that. - Yeah, I should have told you earlier. - Well, it doesn't matter, does it? - It does when you're supposed to be a lighthouse keeper. - Yeah, but, you're never gonna be a lighthouse keeper are you Auggie? - No Dad. - Well good. You have to follow your dreams for your life, not someone else's. - My life? - Yeah. What is it you wanna do again? - Act. - Oh, that's right. Well, you were pretty good in that last play of yours. - Really? - Oh yeah, yeah. I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down. By golly, Auggie you did. - Fifth grade. Thanks. - Auggie, there's one thing you have to promise me. - What's that? - No matter where you go, Auggie take the light with you. - How is that even possible? - Oh Auggie, all things are, all things are possible through Him, who gives us strength. - Even raising a kid all by yourself? - Well, I'm trying. - You're doing a good job. Hey, what can you tell me about your sister? - Beautiful, beautiful girl. Beautiful. You know, my parents, after me, I think they decided to call it quits. But eventually, I guess they forgot about all the trouble I was and 16 years later, if you can believe it, along came Lily. - Lily? - Yeah. - Where is she? - Well, Lily herself in trouble. She, she made a mistake. - Am I that mistake? - No. No. You are my son. Oh Auggie, I'm so tired. - Stay with me Dad. - So tired. - Hey, Dad. You remember this one? - Huh? - What? What's that? - Just go back to sleep Dad. - Huh? - Just go back to sleep. - That's him! - August! - Rhonda? What's going on? - FBI. - Thank God you're alive. - How'd you find us? - Well, brains don't exactly run in Tony's family. When the FBI went to your Dad's house, they found us and the car in the driveway. - And then you came here? - No, the nursing home. That little lighthouse lamp you left in the window, it was an awesome clue. That was really great thinking. - I didn't leave a lamp in the window. - He's burning up! - Auggie. - Yeah. - Is the game over? - Yeah. It's over. - Who are you? Where's Auggie! - Let's get him out of here. - The game is over. - Not quite yet. - Excuse me? - Mr. Star, I have some questions for you. - Like? - Like, for instance, where are they? - Where are what? - The diamonds? - Diamonds? - What's going on over there? - I don't know. Some sort of interrogation? - All right, let's calmly try to go over this all. - One more time. We've been at this for hours. We've searched the house, Keeper's room, the car, the lighthouse. I have no idea where the diamonds are! - Mr. Star, if you refuse to cooperate, we'll just take you in for further questioning. - What? Arrest me? I'm a victim in all of this! - The diamonds were in your possession when they disappeared. - What do you mean, "Disappeared?" How can something disappear that I never saw in the first place? - How convenient. - Look, this is all a big misunderstanding. Why would I drive a car full of hot diamonds all the way to... - Las Vegas! - Vegas! - So you admit you were headed to Las Vegas? - Yes, to deliver the car. - With the diamonds. - What diamonds? - So you didn't go to Vegas? - That's right. - That was your mistake August! The plan was to go to Vegas! - The plan? - There was... - I see. - There was no plan. - Yes there was! My cousin's plan! Which obviously neither August nor I had any part in planning. I mean, just the execution. - The execution? I see. - I see, you see nothing! Tony! Stop talking! - Maybe you both should stop talking. At least until an attorney is present. I'll call Bernie. - Bernie is an entertainment lawyer. We're not negotiating a three picture deal here. - Wait a minute, this would make a great movie. Whatever you do, do not surrender the story rights. - Hold on! This is my story too, I set the whole thing up! - You heard him, he just confessed. Lock him up. - Did not Rhonda! You just wanna keep me from a producers credit! - Producers credit? The day you get a producer's credit... - Can everyone please just settle down? You're agitating the residents. - Oh, no need to stop on our account. We haven't had so much fun since Homer knocked off the pharmacy on Mardi Gras night! - It was not one of our finest hours. - Back to your game boys. - Yes ma'am. - Homer only got away with a case of laxatives. It's not as bad as it sounds. - It's not bad if you want wall to wall... - Back to your game Winnie. - Well, without the jewels in hand, we can't let you go until it is proven that there was no colluding. - Colluding? - Or obstruction. Gentlemen. - What are you doing? - You have a right to remain silent... - You're kidding me, right? - No, I wish I was. - Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law. - He's not kidding either. You know, I had a buddy who didn't know he was being recorded by some stool pigeon so he said... - Shut up Tony! - Fine, fine. My lips are sealed. Unless, unless I can work a plea deal. Yeah? I could. Hey, it's nothing personal. - You have a right to an attorney... - Not Bernie. - If you cannot afford an attorney one will be provided... - Excuse me please, coming through. - Hello Martha, how are you today? - I'm still breathing. I'd love to stay and talk, but I'm late for craft class! Hi Auggie. - Martha. - Well, don't let us stand in your way. - Last time I made this necklace. - Oh, it's beautiful. - This time I'm going to make matching earrings. If Sophie didn't take all the good bling. She's a hoarder you know. - Oh, there there Martha. - Carry on. - As I was saying, you have a right to an attorney. - Wait a minute. Agent Ketchum. - Am I too late for the good ones? - No, no Martha, right on time. Now everyone, don't forget to thank Keeper for donating his bag of broken marbles to our craft time. - All right then, let them go. - Can I make a pair of earrings? Just a small pair. Nevermind. - So, what do we have here? - What is it? - You owe me a dinner. - What are you talking about? We had dinner. - A Martha free dinner. - August, I don't think we should... - Or I could ask Agent Ketchum to take a closer look into the laxative Mardi Gras caper. - That's blackmail. - No, no, that's desperation. - Okay. I'll get my coat. - The light. - Keeper! - The light. The light! - Code blue! We need help here! - Dad? Dad? - Code blue! Keeper? - Code blue! Hey. - Code blue! - What's his status? - His pulse is low, he's having difficulty breathing. Pneumonia. I don't think he's gonna... - Shh. - Keeper. Dad. - Auggie. - I'm here Dad. - The light. - It's me, Auggie. - The light, need the light. - I... - What is it August? - I can't stay here. I have to go. - What are you talking about? What are you doing? - I have to do something. - You have to stay with your Father. - I'll explain later. - August, I don't think there's going to be a later. August, what could possibly be more important than being here? - Being there. - August! - Rhonda, stay with him, please? - I have to tell you something... - Rhonda, please! - Okay. - August. - I have to go. - I know you do. - Oh great, no car. - Just stay here. - No. I'm coming up. Sorry Keeper. Sorry. The Bible? Lily? "Thy word is a lamp to my feet. "The light to my path." The light. The light! Come on. Answer. Answer! - Keep him as comfortable as possible. This is Amanda. - Mandy, August. I need your help. - I'm a little busy right now. I'm with a dying resident. - Good. - What? - He's still alive? - Barely. - Mandy, please listen to me. - I've got to go. - Please, listen! - What do you want? - I need you to move Keeper's bed to the window. - Are you crazy? Any... - Please, just do it! Please Mandy. Now! Move Keeper's bed to the window, please! - Fine. Help me move his bed to the window. Can you help us? - Ah. Hello. - Hi. - All right, the bed is at the window. - Okay, open the curtains. - What's going on? - I have no idea. All right, I'm opening the curtains. August, I... - Please, Mandy, can Keeper see it? - Keeper. - Come on Dad. - Wake up. - Please. - Keeper. I need you to wake up. Keeper. Wake up. - Come on. - Keeper, look. Look at the lighthouse. Look at what Auggie did. - Auggie? - Yes Keeper, Auggie. - He sees it Auggie, he sees the light. - God is light. In Him, there is no darkness at all. - None at all. - Come in. Welcome. - Oh, thank you. - August Star I presume? - Yeah, August Star senior. Not to be confused with my son, August Star junior. - Believe me, I'll never confuse you and Auggie. How 'bout I call you Keeper? - Well, all my friends do. - Well then it's appropriate. Please, come in, sit down. Would you like a cup of tea? I have an Oolong that's out of your world. That's a joke. - No, no tea for me, thank you. - Keeper, do you know who I am? - You are the Author? - I am. What is it? - Well, it's just that you, I mean... Forgive me. - I already have. - Right, right. It's just you're not... - Oh, you were expecting Charlton Heston? I get that all the time. August Star senior, this is your life. Or should I say was your life. - Look, I wanna apologize. - For what? - For this, my life. - It's too late for apologies Keeper. Keeper. Do you really believe what you said you believe is true? - Yes. - Come with me, I wanna show you something. Please. - "In the beginning, God created the Heaven and the Earth." - Not a bad opening if I do say so myself. - "For I know the thoughts that I think "toward you sayeth the Lord. "Thought of peace and not of evil." - To give you an expected end. - "Fear thou not, for I am with thee. - "Be not dismayed, for I am thy God." "I will strengthen thee, "ye will help thee. "Ye I will uphold thee "with the right hand of my righteousness." - "And we know that all things "work together for good to them that love God. - "To them who are called, "according to His purpose." Every great story deserves a hero, don't you agree? - "For God so loved the world "that He gave His only begotten son. "That whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, "but have everlasting life." - Do you believe Keeper? - I do, with all my heart. - It is finished. Welcome home Keeper. This is the point where new arrivals usually show a little more excitement to be here. - Yes, I'm very happy to be here. - But. - But I lived my entire life on Owl's Point. I should've been out and about telling other people this story. - Let me show you something else. Keeper, do you know what these are? - Books? - Each book is a life. - Wow. How do you keep 'em all straight? - God only knows. Hey, you tossed me the ball, I had to hit it. Anyway Keeper, these are stories. Lives. In which you have been a character of great influence. - All these? - Every one. Your story has intersected each and every life you see here. Some of the meetings you don't even recall. Nevertheless, by your example, a sentence, a deed. You helped to write a new chapter in all of these stories. You helped to write events that have and continue to bring people through that very door. Keeper, you have helped the light to pierce the darkness and guide many through the storm far above your duties at Owl's Point. Well done. - What about Auggie? - Your sons story is not yet complete. There are many chapters yet to come. I can't tell you the ending, that would be a spoiler. - I wouldn't mind. - Well, what I can tell you is that the fire you helped to kindle in Auggie's life will continue to burn. Your work is done. - That's what worries me. - No worries here. Auggie is in good hands. Now, how would you like to take a little tour? - Sure. - Michael here will show you the ropes. - Mike! - Good to see you Keeper. - Is he dead too? - Well, I, sort of work here. Come on, I've got a lot to show you. - This place is full of surprises. - You have no idea. - Wait, wait. Thank you. - I'll see you at dinner. And try the lasagna. - Oh, this really is heaven. Come on, what are we waiting for? - I sent them. An opening night ticket for each and every city. - I always wondered why there was an empty seat third row center. - He was very proud of you August. He loved you like a... - A son? Did you love me like a son too, Mom? - I was 17 and alone. I knew you were in good hands. After all, he was the 5th generation of Keepers, and he needed a noble heir. - I was a disappointment to him. - No August, you gave him purpose. The light he cared about was never this old thing. It was you. - And the Word. I sort of turned that switch off after I left here. - He thought we might... After a lot of trouble he found me. He told me you had gone off to follow your dream. And he thought it might be a good time for me to reenter your life. I didn't know how. But I thought you might need a manager. I sat through 12 of your performances in four cities before I got up the nerve to pitch to you. - At least I know where I got my acting chops. - I can't tell you how many times I wanted to tell you. - The truth? Why didn't you? - I didn't wanna lose you. I figured at least as your manager I could be a part of your life. Am I fired? - Yes. You're fired. As my manager, but not as my Mother. I've let too much come between me and family. But not anymore. - Can I have you as a reference? I think there's someone else that might like to have a word with you. - I know one thing's for sure. - What's that? - I will never again think of Owl's Point as a remote, out of the way, hole in the wall, where nothing exciting ever happens. - Told ya so. - You did. You told me a lot. - Sorry, I can be sort of opinionated. - That's a good thing. - Not every time. - Mandy, thank you. You never gave up on Keeper. Or me. - Well, I've learned that just because two people can't talk to each other doesn't mean they can't still listen to each other. Besides, it was good training for me. - Training? - I think I'm gonna have another wanderer on my hands in the not too distant future. - With your love, she'll always find her way home. - That's my part. So, what's next for August Star? - About that. I've never been so uncertain. - I bet for a control freak that's kind of scary. - Real scary. - Well, I've learned that whenever I'm the most uncertain, the answer is usually right around the corner. - That's what you found? - Yeah. - Well, I guess I should get going. - I guess. - Mandy, could you do me a favor and thank Mike for me? I know how much he meant to Keeper. - Mike? - Mike, Keeper's caregiver at Owl's Nest. - Auggie, we don't have a Mike on staff. But I mean, I can always check one of the volunteers... - Nevermind. You know actors, sometimes we have trouble separating fantasy from reality. You're real aren't you? - Last I checked. - Well, I guess this is goodbye. - Goodbye August Star. May your next chapter be your best chapter. - Just around the corner. - Auggie. I'll keep the light on for you. - To?
