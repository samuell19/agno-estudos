# I'm riding a big blue ball # # I never did dream # # I would fall # # But even the day that I do # # I'll jump off # # And smile back at you # # We don't even know # # Where we are # # They tell us we're circling a star # # Well, I'll take their word # # For I don't know # # Well, I'm dizzy # # So maybe that's so # Attention, please. Flight 432 arriving Salt Lake City from Los Angeles via Las Vegas. There he is! There he is! Gotta tuck in my shirttail. Who gives a shit about your shirttail? Oh, yay, you're tall. What'd you expect, a midget? No, I'm just glad you're tall. Hey, cousin, good to see you. Oh, sorry. This is my husband, Johnny. Was that everything? This is it. This is all I have. So let's get the hell out of here. Okay. Tired? Little bit. I'm happy. They kept giving us these little, tiny bottles of liquor on the airplane. Well, I guess you're entitled to be a little "snockered." # This time if you want m e to come back # # It's up to you # # But remember # # I won't allow the things you used to do # # You're gonna have to the marks and walk the line... # I feel like going jogging. Oh, man, you got to be nuts, tired as you are. Oh, God. I'm out. I'm really out. Yeah. You know, Gary, I can't look into your eyes without feeling full of sadness. Oh, yeah? Well, don't be too sure about that. Whoa-oh-oh-oh. Hey... You're a real criminal, aren't you? Ah, cousin, it's just that I like you a lot, that's all. Shh! Shh! Shh! Gary, I know what you're saying. Believe me. Don't you dare mess up. Understand? Okay. # Well, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy # # Girl, you're surely looking good to me... # Brenda, will you always tell me the truth? Better believe it, buddy. How come you're taking a chance on a man who's spent half his life in the can? Gary, I've been married four times. First time when I was 15. Couldn't live without the guy, right? After two months, I couldn't live with him. And, I guess I sort have been in prison ever since, you know? In my way. So get it straight. The reason I want you out is... Well, let's just say I got a real soft spot for you. Okay, Brenda, I think I understand. Yeah. How's Vern? How long has it been since you've seen him? 25 years. Well he's a lot older, Gary. Here, Gary, let me give you a hand. Yeah, Sterling. Oh, yeah. It's a rush job, Gary. I'll do it myself. Vern? I feel useless. Well, you can't learn everything immediately. Yes, Mrs. Mann? Vern, I really need those shoes. I just wondered when I could have them? I'll get them for you. Don't you worry. Hi, Sterling. Look at that, man, I haven't seen nothing like that in 12 solid years. Mama! Shake it! Oh, man! Mmm! Get back to your shoes. What do you think of my nephew? He's a nice fellow, Vern. Awful horny guy. I didn't always have red hair. I used to be an ash blonde before my divorce. And then it was a little brown, but it was just yuck. Settled on red 'cause it suits my temperament. Being a redhead is being me. Well, you haven't been in a bar lately, have you, Gary? No. Let's play the jukebox. You make the selections. Okay. # Well, I left Kentucky back in '49 # # Went to Detroit working on assembly line # # First year, they had me putting wheels on Cadillacs # # Every day I'd watch t hem beauties roll by... # Why'd you tell Vern you'd go out with me? It's simple. You need a friend. And I need a new friend. Seem to be getting no place with my old friends. Do you normally do this? Just drive around like this? It relaxes me. It don't bother you, me being here? Not in the least. Will you go to a motel with me? No. I am here to be your friend. If the other is what you want, you better look someplace else. Well, I'm sorry, I haven't been around girls very much, you know? You can't have it all in five minutes, Gary. You have to earn it, bit by bit. Yeah, well, you know, you got it real easy, you know? Listen, I work hard. I've worked super hard to have my home and my car, and my color TV. Jesus, I don't want to hear anymore of that. Well, you're going to. You want to hit me. Don't you? Can I hug you? Don't rush so, Gary. You got time. You're not going to see me again, are you? I'm sorry I messed it up. Vern will probably be disappointed in me. I guess you think I gobble like a pig, kind of quick. I noticed you eat fast. You see, in prison you get 15 minutes to get your food, sit down, eat it, and get out of there, otherwise you don't eat. But you managed. Yeah. Well, now, why don't you take a little more time? # Slippin' and a-slidin', playin' dominoes # # Leftin' and a-rightin' ain't a crime, you know # # Well, they got to tell the story, folks # # Before it's time to go # # Are you ready for the country, ready for me? # # Better get ready for the country # # Get ready for me # # Yeah. # Get the crowbar, and I'll find the blowtorch. Gary. Gary! You're, uh, running that drill in reverse. Didn't know it had a reverse. Hey, Spence, I'm sorry I'm late. Well, it's the first time,Gary, it's no big deal. I couldn't hitch a ride, I had to walk it. You walked the seven miles from Provo? Yeah. You been doing that every day? Yeah. I been trying real hard, Spence. I ain't learned how to fly yet. Hey, you're all right, Gary. You know that? You got the makings of right good stuff in you. Tell you what. You stick around after work tonight. I'm gonna make sure you get a ride home. Now, this car is tagged at $795, but, uh, I need space, Spence, so I'll move it for you for $550. That sounds reasonable, Val. But look here, Gary's only taking home $95 a week after taxes. Uh-huh. If I put in the first $50, you carry him for the rest at $25 a week, okay? That sounds functional. # Too many roads # # I've been up and down # # Too many nights # # The days of one more round # # Too many times I done kicked my body down # # And I don't know if I can get it up to get it on again # # Da, da, da, da, da # # Too many ins and outs and downs and rounds # # Too many times I done kicked my body down... # I haven't seen Sterling in a while. Mommy. I'm here. We're gonna see Sterling. We're gonna go see Sterling. Come on. All right. Come here. We're gonna go see Sterling. Come on, sweetheart. Sterling. Say, "Hi, Sterling." Well, hi, there. Hi. Oh, hi. How you doing? Hi. Hi. You look nice tonight. Now that my old lady's left me, I'm a hell of an attraction to you girls. Uh-huh. Well, thank you. Hey. I know you. How do you know me? I know you. From some other life or some damn thing. Stop kicking your feet. I told you not to do that. Momma, he's real nice. This little girl could wind up in reform school. Maybe I'm the kind of moth that does that to her children. Oh, hey, I, I was on ly wanting to talk to you. I just wanted to count all the freckles on you. Of course, you can't count the freckles on an elf. Come on. Go get some beer. I can't. I have to take my kids home. Your girlfriend ain't ready to leave here, yet. Nicole, go with him. I'll take your kids over to Sue's. # That's all that's left of all those years # # You had to leave me, you had to go... # This banana's for your kids, by the way. Thank you. State sent me to school for a week so I'll learn how to use a power sewing machine. But as soon as I got the hang of it, they put me on another one. The new machine screws up when you least expect it. I never let them put me in no shop. You put in time? Half my life. You another loser? Oh, I figure I'm paying off my karma. I heard that word. Is it like reincarnation? Yeah, right. See, after you die, your soul comes right back to Earth. Then it's reborn in a new body. And you're supposed to pay for what you did wrong in your last life. That's the only thing that makes any sense. You have to face yourself. That's the whole point of living. If you don't... your burden's going to grow. I have thoughts like this all the time. But I never knew you could have a conversation about them. Hey, uh, I think I'm going to crash for awhile. Good night. Good night. I don't want to just jump in bed with you. I want to make love to you. You know, I'd sleep with a fellow instead of hurting his feelings. I've been married three times. Only I haven't been with a guy in a long time 'cause I don't want to. But you're so beautiful... and fresh and young. And sweet. Gary, I've dated more guys than you want to count. I don't care. You're my guardian angel. Guardian angel. Listen. My mother... was once stranded with my brother and me in the desert. My old man took off and left us. in Humboldt Sink, Nevada. I was only four, and we didn't have any money. We hadn't eaten for days. We hitchhiked it home to Provo. And there were no cars. And then a man comes walking down the road out of nowhere, and he said, "Here, my wife fixed a lunch, but it's more than I can eat." Mom said, "Well, I'd be really grateful." And we were so hungry, we just started eating. And when I finally looked up to thank that man, he was gone. Right out on the desert, on a long, flat stretch. I didn't know it, but that man was my guardian angel. And I lost him, a long time ago. When you came in here tonight... I said to myself, "Boy, you got your guardian angel back." This your address? I wouldn't lie to you. Truly? I'm coming over after work. Hey, just a little bit too much beer. Yeah, I want one. No, more cookies. I told you to stop worrying about it. You'll get better. You remember the first time you did it? Vaguely. What do you mean "vaguely"? Wasn't that big a deal. I was 11. You're a tolerant guy. You're perfect. I've heard that one before. No, no, you're an angel. Really, I believe that's so. Do you love me? I don't know if I've ever been in love with a guy. It's like I have crushes. You got a crush on me? With you, I feel like I'm in the right place for the first time. So, where do you live? Yeah. Down the road. Springville, Spanish Fork, what? Spanish Fork. Mmm, she got it. Yeah. Like a pickle? Thank you. Mm-hmm. Hot dog, please. One hot dog. Don't you love her, Brenda? Huh? Oh, yeah. Yeah, don't you? Oh, yeah, sure do. Like it? No, I don't. Well, I think it looks kind of nice. Yeah, well, it's done with a real nice, steady touch, but it looks a lot like you stepped in shit. Where's your bathroom? Uh, it's back there, turn to your left. I really love that girl, Brenda. You think she might be too old for me? Oh, no, Gary. Not at all. I think you're both on the exact same level of intellectual maturity. Yeah, and well, you know, sometimes I feel like I'm 19. Like her, you know? Gary, why don't you grow up? You're 35. You're blunt. Yeah? Well, damn it, Gary, you come in here with this welfare witch who's living on the government forever... You want my good opinion, Gary? A real space cadet. You're rotten. We're going. I don't want to go. Brenda, you're really ignorant. Mommy, I don't want to go home. We're leaving, and you're a disgrace. Oh, Gary! Get in the car, Jeremy. Gary, just a second. Gary. When did you paint your mustang? It's her car, man! What, same year? No, we bought our cars on the same day. Can you see the beauty in that? It's a sign! I love her. All right, Gary. Psst. Gary. God bless you. You got yourself a good-looking girl. I love you. Hot dogs? Hmm? Baby, I never believed that women could be as sweet-smelling as you are. Damn, you're glorious. You're an angel to babysit for Nicole and me. I'm going to go phone her right now. Vern. Looks like Gary just tried to proposition your granddaughter. I want you to stay away from that child. What? What are you talking about, Vern? I was just asking her to babysit. Pete says he saw something. Now, I don't know what he saw, Gary, but I don't want to think there's anything out of the way. Galovan, get over here! I'm here. What did you see me do, man? I didn't see you do nothing, Gary, but the appearances left no doubt in my mind. Maybe I should've kept my mouth shut. But it seems that your interest in Vern's granddaughter don't look right to me. Okay, motherfucker, you draw the line, now, man. You want to fight? Get out back. You had enough? Let him up! That was rotten, Gary. Hitting a man from behind. Get out of here right now, Gary. I'm calling the police. All right, man, let's go again. Now, come on. Geez. I'm going to call them anyway. You do what you have to do. Pete Galovan! Galovan, why'd you call them? You're absolutely right, Nicole. I'm the man who got in touch with Gary's parole officer. But let me tell you, he hurt me. My neck is in pain right now. Pete, the guy's been locked up a long time. It takes awhile to get used to being really out. Yeah, but he hit me from behind. Gary's dangerous, he needs help. I'm the only one that can help him. That's because I love Gary. Love is the only way to really help a person. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Love can bring the spiritual power of God to a situation. But this is a bad situation. Your man is far gone. He wants to kill me. Pete Galovan, if you press charges, they'll arrest Gary, and then they'll let him out on bail. He'll get you then. Even if they lock him up right away. He's more important to me than my life. He's a hell of a lot more important to me than your life. If he don't get you, I will. All right. I'll drop the charges against Gary. Maybe your man needs another chance. But now I want you to kneel with me. I want you to pray. It's for you and Gary. You're both gonna need it. Our Father in heaven, please have mercy on Nicole, this young girl, and upon Gary, the possible father of her children. God bless them, and... please give Gary some control in his life, which is essential to... to his well-being. We ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. They sent me here to the nuthouse when I was 11. What for? They catch you with your first boyfriend? My first boyfriend happened to be my uncle. Uncle Lee. Your uncle? Well, he wasn't really my uncle. He was just a friend of the family. I'll kill him for you. Too late. He got burnt in Vietnam. Nicole, come back here! Can you hear tho se psychos in the nuthouse? Yeah. You think they call up spirits? I believe they can. I think crazy people are very close to the spirits, yeah Yeah, they call 'em forth. Are you the devil? I had a friend one time in reform school named Paul. I held him down while he got raped. Well, see, I ran into him later on in prison, and he was making this ring out of silver. I said, "Give me that ring, punk." And he said, "Are you the devil?" I didn't answer him. I just took his fucking ring. When I got married for the second time, my mother was so mad, she dressed me in a black wedding dress. It was short with a slit up the sides. Nobody in the house took a picture of the bride. Motherfucker! Endorse it. Do what? Write your name on the back of it. Gary, I don't want to go around knocking on doors. You bring the 50 bucks in, not a six-pack. I don't like that Mustang. It gets left at intersections. Mm-hmm. Well, let's get it straight, partner. With your credit, I'm doing you the favor. What I want is a truck. You got a white truck right out here in your lot. I'm very highly interested in that truck. Well, you pay for the Mustang first. That truck is mucho mazuma. Lists for $1,700. Too much truck for you, partner. Hmm. My uncle Vern will cosign with me. Your uncle Vern ain't in shape for that kind of credit. Give me a credit app, Val. Oh, boy, Val, is he hot. I don't give a damn. People come around me to get hot. I think that's about two pounds worth. I'll just put it on a scale and see. Honey, I think the kids ate all the peanut butter. Better get some. You know Bishop Christionson's son is going to go to Brazil on his mission. And there's eight... Hey, Mister! Here you go, Vern. Well, it's very nice of you to offer me a case, Gary. How can you afford it? I don't need money for beer. You realize you're violating your parole. You gonna turn me in? I might. If it persists, I might. Fuck it. Gary, stop. It's a bummer. Sorry. I'm not used to sex with girls. You're using downers, Gary. I got that headache. Don't hassle me. Well, then don't start what you can't finish. Sometimes, when we're, making love, there's an old nightmare that comes back to me where I feel, uh... like I'm in this closed up space. And there's that old, uh, terrible smell of oldness comes back and I feel like I am dead. Come inside. I'll mellow you out. We thought I was gonna improve. All right, now... This? Keep it straight, get it straight. Keep your aim straight. # I got me a habit that I surely gotta quit # # Ain't got a habit but I'm hooked a little bit # # Every time I try to see you # # Lord you're nearly never home # There you go. # And I wouldn't call at all but you give good phone # # Talk good boogie but you won't get down # # Tell me that you love me but you won't come around # Not bad, huh? # Talk good boogie but you won't get down # One hot lady.

No! # Every time I really think I really got a chance... # Sterling, it is your birthday and you are owed one birthday kiss. Mmm, hell, I'll take you up on that. Okay, Gary? You having fun? Mm-mm-mm! Mm! Mm. Hey, man, we want them sunglasses back! That's a birthday present from me to Sterling. I do not want them ripped off. Cool out, Gary. Fuck you! Fuck you! You're messing up the party. Yeah! Enough, enough! Gary, no! Damn it! The party! Jimmy! Stop, Jim! We're going. It's over, Gary. This is fucked. I don't like to get whipped. I hate to see it. Oh, baby, I got whipped in front of everybody and yet you're still being real nice to me. Yeah, well, I love you all the way. No, goddamn it to hell! How you doing, Gary? I want that white truck. Well... we're not anywhere near it, Gary, till you come in with the money. I'll bring in the money. All right. What's the matter? This car, man. This goddamn car. Well, now, hold it. Let's get some jumper cables. We'll get it started for you, partner. Gary. Oh, pardner. Don't call me "pardner." I love it... I love it, pardner. Yeah? Well, why don't you get yourself a little boy? Oh, no, baby, I hit you... I'm sorry sweetheart. I'll never hit you again, sweet... baby. It always ends the same way. I'm so... No, no, no, no, baby, you gotta forgive me. Sweetheart, please, please forgive me, baby, I'm sorry. I could die. You want to die? No, I guess I don't. That's right, you don't. You don't. Eat that up... that's good. I've been telling you all day I don't want to go. I need you and the kids... I don't want no state trooper pulling me over 'cause I don't look right, okay? Well, I ain't driving in the car with those guns. Nicole, I found a guy to buy them. Lousy stolen guns. Shut up, Jeremy. Oh, no. I know. Hey, what's happening? Hi. Trying to get out of here, huh? The guy ain't there. That's the second place he ain't there. This evening's been right-out wasted. Pull over! You're gonna kill us all, pull over! Damn it! Stop it! Shut up! Shut up, you're driving me nuts! Fuck you! You be quiet! Just be quiet, I'll let you go. Hush! Goddamn! Bitch! Ow! Get out of the car. Get out of here. Go on, take your fucking kids! Fuck you! Come on. Come on, Jeremy. Go on, get out of here. Go on! Wait a minute! Get back in the car; you're gonna get run over. Help! I hate you! I hate your guts! Come here, bitch. Help! No! Keep it going. I hate you! I hate you. Nicole, is that you? Nicole. Pepper. Oh, Lordy, Pepper. Hey, get over here, bitch. This is a family affair. I've known Nicole since she's six years old, and you ain't family. Come back here, bitch. Come on back here, bitch, you get back here, bitch! Come here, bitch! I love you. Gary. She's out of my life, can I stay here tonight? Come on in. My old lady's back, so coolit. I'm gonna hide for a few days, Mama, and I ain't gonna tell you where. I would never tell him nothing. He's awful persistent. Hi. Kathryne, I want you to take good care of this beer. It's stolen property. My gosh. Weren't you afraid? No, I always act l ike I own the place. What have you got yourself there, Gary? Guns. Guns? Yeah. Oh. Want to leave them here for a little while. My God, Gary. Just for a little while. What do you think of that. 44 Magnum? It's nice, they're all nice. I gave Nicole this real sweet little over-and-under Derringer, to protect herself. I want you to have this Special. You're a woman living alone. Gary, I still got my ex-husband's Magnum. That's too much for you, you need a Special. Kathryne. I want you to give this picture of me to Nicole. Where you going? I'm gonna look for Nicole. Sue, these cigarettes are for Nicole. I'll give them to her if I see her. If you see her, you tell meabout it. Sue, where is she? Sue, where is she? Look, I've been looking everywhere for her. I looked in the Laundromat five times. Where is she? Gary, I don't ever know where my own husband is. We're out of draft, want some CornNuts? No. Oh, baby. Gary. Let go of me. Baby? Baby. I have to get away, man. Ain't living with you anymore. Go ahead, shoot, shoot. Get away from my car. Too bad, pardnerer. You're leaving the accessories to the vacuum cleaner, and they're gonna get ripped off! Shit. All right, damn it, Gary. I've accepted the Mustang as a down payment, plus another $400 you've promised to bring in tomorrow morning, plus another $400 in ten days. Oh, Val, Val, you can count on me. Well, you just get the money, Gary. Get the money! You seen Nicole? No, Gary, I still ain't seen her. As far as I'm concerned, she can go to hell. Straight to hell. Gary, I can't believe you'd use words like that for Nicole. I want that Special back. You can have it tomorrow, when you're sober. If I'm gonna use a gun, this little baby right here will take care of it all. All right, man, I'll get it. Stay on the porch, April. Gary, Gary! My mama, she won't take me to the Kmart to get new guitar strings. Get in the truck. April, you can't go. I'll bring her back. Maybe Nicole will be here when we return. Gary! # In this life, there's no concern # # And you get a whole lot of hurtin' # # A heart full of sadness... # Gary, my guitar needs new strings. To attract more harmonious spirits. You're in tune with the heaviest strings, aren't you? # I can see there'll be no forgettin' # # A heart full of hurtin', a heart full of tears... # I want to stay out all night. Oh, yeah. I'm in orbit, too. You had to leave me, you had to go Oh, Gary. # It's not like holding you # # In this life there's no concern # # And you get a whole lot of hurtin'... # I'm gonna make a phone call. # A heart full of tears # # That's all that's left of all the years # # That's all that's left of all the years # # That's all that's left of all the years. # Hi, can I help you? Yeah. Go inside. Give me all your money. Now go to the bathroom. Lay down on the floor. Put your arms underneath your body. This one's for me. This one's for Nicole. Let's drive a little. Judas Priest. Do you believe this guy? Now, what kind of an idiot would do that, shooting a guy for nothing? I can understand if he has to fight for the money. But... but to take anybody who'd take the cash, then take the kid in the back room, lay him on the floor and shoot him in the back of the back of the head, twice! I mean, he's gotta be a psycho maniac. Maybe that fellow deserved to die, Val. Oh, come on, Gary, to shoot a kid for nothing? You gotta be crazy, man. Val, would you like a beer? No, I don't want a beer. I want you to remember that if you don't bring the $400 in by tomorrow, you lose the truck and the Mustang. Yeah, yeah. Hey, Gary. You've been away for hours. Yeah, I'm really sorry, Spence. It's the fourth time in the last two weeks you lost half a day. Well, yeah, I know, but I've... my girl's had a really bad case of acute indigestion I've been cleaning up puke all afternoon, I'm... Go to work. Hey, Spence, you know I'm really sorry, but you know, I know... it's a real bad time, and I just hope you'll bear with me. Just go to work. Oh, Spence, I got a friend that's got some guns to sell on commission. You think I could interest you in 357 Magnum with a six-inch barrel? Good God, Gary, I don't need a howitzer. Now please go to work! Yes, sir. I am telling you, if a woman don't want to see you, it's no use looking for her. I don't think I can take this. You and Johnny always been real happy. You don't know what this is. Uh-uh, Johnny and me have come very close to getting divorced, Gary, it can be real frightening. You think Nicole went out with some other man? I don't know. I think I'm gonna... I'm gonna kill her. Great, you that selfish of a lover? Fuck it, I'm in misery. I got this ulcer starting up. Put it in the bay, we'll check the thermostat. I'll do a little visiting. All right. Vehicle is being impounded at 200 North... Vern? ...be able to psyche out his younger, less experienced opponent. And he makes it, Vasili Alexeyev of the Soviet Union snatching 195 kilos with power to spare. Can I help you? Somebody help me! Please! Please, somebody! Somebody help me, please! Somebody! Somebody help me! Shit. All fixed. You get it all done? Yep, all done. Just... just put it on my tab. Okay, hey, take care. You look a little wasted, get some Z's. Yeah, I think I'll crash. Open up a line to the hospital. 29? Close off the intersection. Car 23, close off the off-ramp at BYU. Close off the on-ramp at the interstate. I want every room checked. Find out if there's anyone els e who saw... All right, check around. Here's the bag. Okay, let's get some CPR going, guys. Look, that's a police car. Two, three,... Somebody call and get another unit. ...four, five... We're all right! Vern, Gary did it. How do you know? Did you see him do it? No. How do you know I didn't do it? Vern, there was blood all over his hand. Officer, listen. This guy left blood all over my gas station. I caught his license, he's driving a white truck. Phil? It's possible my nephew, Gary Gilmore, had something to do with this. You'd better check it out. Dad? Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Vern... do you think Gary did it? Yes. Dumb son of a bitch. Somebody shot... that nice man Mr. Bushnell next door. They seen Gary running away. He'll come to you; he always does. Yeah, right. Could I talk to the chief, please? Yeah, Chief, hi, this is Brenda Nicol calling. Could you catch my neighbor, Toby Bath, before he goes off duty, please? Yeah, just... just ask him to stop by Johnny Nicol's house, all right? Thanks a lot. Sterling, I want you to take me to the airport. Gary, I ought to bring you to the hospital. Hospitals don't understand ex-convicts with gunshot wounds. I guess not. Go call Brenda for me. How you doing, Gary? Brenda, I had this dumb accident. Uh, I'll explain it to you later. It's... I got shot in the hand. Uh, it's hurting real bad, and, um,... can you come to me? Yeah, of course I'll come, um... I'll bring some codeine and some bandages. Now, you just gotta tell me where you are, Gary. Okay. Right. Either I'll be coming or Johnny will. Okay, honey. Toby, um, Sterling's got a wife and a kid. You can't pick up Gary there. You'll have a shootout. All right, let's go down to police headquarters, and maybe they can figure something out. Brenda, in the meantime, will you stall Gary? Say anything. How long has Johnny been gone? He must be having some trouble with all those weird roads in Pleasant Grove, Gare. He's always getting lost there. Don't worry. He'll find you. If Johnny's not here in five minutes, I'm leaving.

Mr. Gilmore, you're under arrest for criminal homicide You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to talk to a lawyer and have him present with you while you are being questioned. If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent you before questioning, if you wish. You can decide at any time... Locally here in Orem last night... ...was apprehended by police. He's been identified as Gary Mark Gilmore. Yeah, hello. Brenda, why didn't Johnny show up? Gary, you commit a murder on Monday, you commit a murder on Tuesday. I wasn't about to wait till Wednesday rolled around. I called them. Well, don't lose no sleep over it. You just go soak your head, okay? What about your mother, Gary, what do you want me to tell her? You tell her what you're gonna tell her. You will anyway, you snitch. Fuck you. Give me that. Nicole? I'm Lieutenant Nielsen. I don't want to see him; he'll just mess me up. Well, it's your decision. Nicole, you want a beer? I'll tell him. Hold up. Maybe I will. You can sit right there. Hello, baby. Hello, Gary. No physical contact. Did you do it? Nicole, don't ask me that. Baby, I wrote you a letter. They'll give it to you on the way out. I love you. I... I don't know what I feel. I got to get out of here. Nothing in my experience prepared me for the kind and open, honest love you gave me. I'm so used to hostility, deceit and pettiness, evil and hatred. These things are my natural habitat. They have shaped me. I look at the world through eyes that suspect, doubt, fear, hate, cheat, all selfish and vain. I truly belong in a place this dank and dirty. Gary! Gary! Gary Gilmore! Gary! Yeah, babe! Gary! Gary Gilmore, can you hear me? Gary! Gary Gilmore, I love you! You gotta leave. Why? You can be arrested for doing a thing like this. I didn't know they can keep you from expressing yourself. They say I gotta go, I'll write to you! Write to me again! You read all his shit? Gary writes a lot. Maybe I don't read every word. Just scrounge through? No, I read them. Every night. You answer them? Every night. You're crazy. I got your letter today where you wrote that you fucked a guy twice. Twice. I can't stand the thought of some man holding your naked body. You gotta be all mine, baby. I'm locked up, I can't get it. Why can't you go without, too? Nicole, I have to keep thinking of the men who've known you, used you and hurt you. I try to understand as well as I can. I tell myself that you get by on very little money, and you raise your kids to the verybest of your ability. You are true and sincere, and I realize that I love you utterly. I can't see you anymore, you got to go. You're a flake. That old man of yours is gonna get nothing but lead poisoning. Bang, bang! Bang, bang, bang, bang. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. Is there anything the defendant would like to say to the jury? Well, I'm glad to see that the jury is finally looking at me. No, I have nothing to say. Since the verdict of the jury is death, do you have an election as to the mode of death? I prefer to be shot. Very well, that will be the order. You're not gonna find this like the county jail. Big boy, there ain't nothing you can tell me about state prisons; I've been there before. I'm here to see Gary Gilmore. I'm glad you came. Well, you invited me, didn't you? Yeah, but you weren't gonna come, were you? No, but I came. I couldn't resist looking a stupid man right in the face. Maybe Iwasstupid. Yeah, you don't believe it. I might. I mean, after all, you gave me a chance and I blew it. I... I want to tell you I appreciate that chance. Now, we don't want to talk as if we're friends, cause we may not be. I don't like what you did at all. It was mean and dirty. I'm a bad man, I guess. You're bragging. What would you say if I told you I deserve to die? I'd say you we re a damn fool. Don't pay any attention to what I say. Pay attention to what I do. Your Honor, the Supreme Court of the State of Utah... ...Mr. Gilmore has asked me to act as his new attorney. My name is Dennis Boaz. Mr. Boaz, you may proceed. Mr. Gilmore asks that the motion for appeal filed by his former attorney be set aside and that he be allowed to be executed. Gary Gilmore, are you in fact at this moment ready to accept execution? Not at this moment. But I am ready to accept it next Monday morning at 8:00 a.m. That's when it was set, and that's when I'm ready to accept it. Mr. Boaz, how does Gary Gilmore feel about the decision of the Utah Supreme Court to lift the stay? It brings him peace. Well, Mr. Boaz, why do you think Gary Gilmore committed the crime in the first place? Let me answer that as if I were a right-winger, which I am not. The prison system is a completely regimented, controlled way of life. Just check it out. For more than a dozen years, Gary was told when to go to bed, when to get up and when to eat. That's totally contradictory with our capitalist lifestyle. Then one day, they put Gary out on the street and they say, "Here, today is magic. "Now you're a capitalist. Go out and do it on your own." "Find a job, get up in the morning, "get to work on time, manage your money. Do everything we taught you not to do while in prison." Guaranteed to fail. I reckon your karma's got a lot to pay for if you commit suicide. I'm not asking you to. But you want me to. I want us to be together. I love you more than God. If I do, what about my kids? Your children come through you, baby. They're not of you. Everybody's an individual soul. You're not really thinking about my kids. Baby, if you have to, I know you'll stay alive and take care of them. Only once I'm gone, I don't know what I'm gonna do if you're with another man. I wish we were dead together. Did Gary seem like himself when you saw him today? He told me he'd just as so on be shot right now. Yeah, what did you say back? I said maybe he should. You really got a sense of humor, girl. Listen. Get one thing straight. Gary deserves the death penalty. You don't understand him. You try understanding them poor women that has to raise their kids without a father while you're running up every cockeyed day to see the killer. I don't want to hear a goddamn thing you got to say. Raise your arms. Lift your foot. Lift your other foot. Yard door is open for recreation. Repeat, yard door is open... Open section twelve, Harry. Thank you. I got it. How many is it? 25 reds and ten downers. Hope it's enough. Remember when I asked you if you was the devil? Yeah. Are you? The devil doesn't feel any love. I may be further away from God than I am from the devil. I know evil very intimately. Oh, oh, I trust you. I'm gonna do it. Go to sleep now. Go to sleep, Sunny bunny. Go to sleep, Jeremy. Mom, please do not resent my leaving this life. If I could spare you all any pain, I surely would. I love you all. Please love my kids always as they are part of the family. Never hide truth from them. Try not to grieve for me or resent Gary. I love him. How did he get the stuff? Is he going to be allowed visitors? Is he conscious? What did he say? Get back! Yeah. Okay. Oh. No. No. No. No! No! I can't put Nicole in a mental hospital. If you don't sign, we have to get a court order saying she's incompetent and suicidal. It's a lot of awful publicity. Mrs. Baker, it's just not safe to let her out. Gary Gilmore will talk her into suicide again. Dr. Brooks, Dr. Brooks, wanted in O.R. Dr. Brooks, Dr. Brooks, wanted in O.R. I don't want him ever to get near my daughter. There won't be anymore contact visits. I'm sorry. I gotta talk to you! Sit here, please. You can use this telephone to talk to him. It's temporary while he's over here at the prison hospital. Gary will you pick up the telephone, please. ...Warden Smith, Henry Bay. George... Well, we didn't end very good, did we? I don't think I'm very mad anymore. I'm glad to hear that. I need you. Whatever for, Gary? I want you to act as my representative, take care of things. I'm a shoemaker, Gary. I don't think I can handle it, something as big as this. Vern, with your business ability and my practical sense, who can stop us? Let's shake on it. You know how to do that through glass? Hey, Gary, you ol' shit head. Looks like you're gonna pull through, huh? You ain't changed none. You still mad at me? Well, I don't give a damn. Glad you're alive. Only I'm wondering, Gary, how come you didn't take enough pills to do the job? What are you talking about? Well, Gary, come on. You know a whole lot about drugs. You know how much to take. I bet you just wanted to stay around long enough to see whether Nicole was dead or... maybe just damaged in her brain some. I don't think like that. Ah, come on, Gary. If she's brain damaged, nobody else is gonna want her, right? You're a wretched woman. And you're a scum-sucking pig. You have a vile and dirty mouth. Miss Baker is not going to hear Gilmore's name any more than necessary. Make it clear. No aid or patient here is to mention it. That may be impossible. She has to be allowed to see her relatives. Well, warn them. She's under our supervision now. As far as I'm concerned, Gilmore is out of her life. Locally, Pastor Confare stated, "The Old Testament idea of an eye for an eye, "was replaced by the New Testament concepts of love and rehabilitation." Pastor Confare stated, "Gilmore doesn't want to be rehabilitated." He also pointed out... Let's show'em, gang! ...kept alive by machine in the hospital, who wants the plug pulled. And because of the many questions Come on, guys about Gary Gilmore's sentencing, Governor Rampton has asked the Utah Board of Pardons to review Gilmore's deat sentence at their next meeting, that means the execution... Hi. cannot take place as scheduled. And this morning Provo County attorney Noall Wootton stated, Chocolate milk, please. "I've done my job. I asked for and got the death penalty." Lou, there is no way that this story can miss. Look, if we get Gilmore's okay but no Nicole, we do a scenario of a guy who comes out of prison, struggles with old con habits before killing a man. On the other hand, if we can get the girl but we can't sign Gilmore, then we focus the whole thing completely on Nicole. I mean, here's a study of an adolescent, saddled with children, who falls in love with a criminal. I am sure of the potentialities. And I want the network to back me in a real way. I want to be able to get in there and deal for this property. Everybody's here. The stamp is on the meat. I'm prepared to offer yo u a total of $75,000 for all rights, of which Nicole will get a third. In effect, I'm offering Gary $50,000. This is a firm offer, Mr. Damico. This is not a bargaining stance. These are the real prices that are available. Other producers eventually may tell you that the property may be worth $10 million. Watch them only offer a small amount now. The likelihood is, the big piece will never be seen. Mr. Susskind called me from New York. He said the difference between him and you is the difference between a high school football team and the Dallas Cowboys. Mr. Susskind is right. Heisequal to the Dallas Cowboys, and in his eyes I'm maybe just a high school football team. But I am here, Mr. Damico, all suited up, ready to play. Where are the Dallas Cowboys? They're not even in the stadium. I'm listening. Mr. Gilmore, your uncle has asked me to serve as your lawyer, but I can't represent this case by myself. There could be a conflict of interest. Suppose you change your mind and want to appeal. Then the movie and book rights to your life story will be worth less when Mr. Samuels gets around to selling them. I don't want to ask myself whether your death will be more profitable to me than your life. So I've asked Mr. Stanger, here, to represent you on your court appearances. Okay, let me talk to Samuels. Warden Smith, Warden Smith, report to the visiting room. Who's gonna play me in the movie? Well, who'd you have in mind? Well, there was this guy in, uh, in that movie "Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia" (1974) That's Warren Oates. Yeah, Warren Oates. I like him; I want him to play me. Put it in the contract. Warren Oates might not be available. I might not want Warren Oates. You're getting into my part of the business. I have to say no. Larry, we both know Warren Oates ain't handsome enough to play me. All right. Who do you really want? Gary Cooper. I was named after him. Are you a Hollywood producer? How much is Gilmore being paid? Who do you represent? Has Gilmore spoken to his girlfriend yet? Have you spoken to Gilmore's brother? Gilmore's family's appealing the state. Who are you paying for the rights, Samuels? Who do you represent, Samuels? Why was Dennis Boaz fired? I want to apologize for driving you around in a Rolls Royce. It's my boss's. I don't care about the accommodations. I just want to get to the prison to see my brother. It's been four years. Yeah, well, you will. I succeeded in getting an unrestricted visit. There won't be a glass window between you. Mikal, you realize Gary's execution is going to have fatal results for a lot of men on death row, everywhere. The guard says Canfield brought you out here in a Rolls Royce. It's not important. Those liberals are idiots, Mikal. I might have to help them. Who do you think the ACLU is? A bunch of holy men? They're using you so they can get to me so they can make headlines in New York. That's how they make their money. Gary, they won't be doing it, I will. Would you really appeal, against my wishes? Violate my privacy? Gary, save it. I know you too well. Every time you broke into a house when you were a kid, you spoiled it for the people who lived there. You violated their privacy. You're an incredibly selfish human being. Watch it, kiddo. No I want to speak. I've always been too frightened of you to say anything, but face it, brother, I may appeal your execution. Maybe I believe your redemption can only be found by your choosing to live. Very well put, Mikal. But you don't have to live here. And I do. I've been here so long there's nothing left in me. When they first sent me to juvenile hall, two boys held me down and raped me. Right at the bucket. Two years later, I was the one holding down the new kids. On the inside of every wolf, there's a scared little punk looking for revenge. I see. No, you don't. I don't want anybody holding me down again, Mikal. I want to die while I'm still strong. Good-bye. I'll see you in the darkness. Minicam Two, ready. We're live to New York. And today, in Washington, DC, the ACLU filed a motion to appeal the execution of Gary Gilmore. Locally, the Board of Pardons, tomorrow, will review Gilmore's death sentence. Imagine that cheap killer getting all this attention. We, of the Board of Pardons, are meeting here at the request of the governor to review your death sentence. Do you have a statement you'd like to make? I accepted the sentence that was given to me. I've accepted sentences all my life. I didn't know I had any choice in the matter. Then everybody wanted to jump up and argue with me about it. Seems that the people of the State of Utah want to have the death penalty, but they don't want any executions. When it became a reality, well, they started backing off on it. Well, I took them literal and serious when they sentenced me to death. Just like they'd sentenced me to ten years or 30 days in the county jail or something. I thought you was supposed to take them serious. I didn't know I was a joke. In my opinion, you're all acting like a bunch of moral cowards. Mr. Gilmore, in spite of what you might think of us, we on the Board of Pardons here are not cowards. We will make this decision on the statutes of the State of Utah, and not your desires. This morning, the Supreme Court ruled in your favor. They said you made an intelligent waver of your rights. Well, I could've told you the Supreme Court knows I'm intelligent. It's the people of Utah that don't. Now, the execution is set for the 17th of January. Good. It doesn't seem to affect your mood. Someday you guys are going to realize I'm serious. Oh, we do, Gary. Okay, let's get on with Samuels' questions. Samuels is rough today. I warn you. For instance, here's the first one. You speak of this cold, murderous rage you felt on each of the nights of the killings. Samuels wants to know if that rage couldn't have been vented in sex. I don't answer questions that pertain to sex. I think they're cheap. You seem to find it easier to talk about murder than sex. That's your judgment. Next question. What are some of the evil acts you could not perform? Well, that's easy. I don't think I could torture anybody. Isn't forcing somebody to lie down on the ground and shooting them in the back of the head torture? It's a very short torture. How can any crime be worse than taking a life? Well, you could alter somebody. You'd maim 'em, blind em, fuck 'em up so bad the rest of their lives would be in misery. Now, to me, that's a lot worse than killing. I mean, if you kill somebody you might be assuming their karmic debts and thereby relieve them of the burden. So there are crimes you deem worse than murder. I mean, Jesus, look what some governments do to their people. I'm talking about the forms of brainwash, like all the forms of behavior modification, like the irreversible forms. Like lobotomies and Prolixin. I mean, uh, you don't interfere with people's fate, is what I say. Didn't you interfere with Jensen's and Bushnell's lives? Yeah. You think you had any right to do that? No. Did Jensen resist or did he show fear? No, he did not resist. He did not show undue fear. In fact, I was struck by his kind and friendly... smiling face. Next question. Was the second murder any easier than the first? I would say it was a little more certain that Mr. Bushnell was gonna die. Why? Because it was already a fact that Mr. Jenkins had died. Jensen, Gary, not Jenkins. Oh, damn! I hate getting his name wrong like that, man. Damn! Hang in there. Gary, paperboy time. Thank you. Jimmy Carter. Betty Ford. Body of Mao Tse Tung lying in state. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, and do you know who else is right here on this page? Gary Gilmore. No question about it, I'm by now the best known convict in the United States. Father, I'd so much rather be known for my humanitarianism and my intellect. Like Jimmy Carter. Gary... whatever's fair. Move it right in here. Come on, move it in. Just follow him. Move it in here. May I have your attention, please? Are you that dumb that you'r e going to go to your grave not forgiving me for what I did? I'll forgive you, yeah. I guess. I don't know. We got different codes of ethics, after all. Yeah. Anyway, I feel like I ought to say good-bye. Gary... Well, I guess you know that I'm... going to the hospital from here. They're operating on me early this evening. Yeah, I heard. They didn't say what for. It's my insides. They just got to cut out a couple of knots. God, Brenda, you sure are a mess. I love you. Hurry up, Jerry. Is that Gilmore's lawyer? Yeah, and that's his uncle with him. Hey, here they come. Mr. Damico, do you think Gilmore's repented of his two murders? Do you think there's going to be another stay? Has the ACLU spoken to you, Mr. Moody? Will Gilmore make a statement to the press before the execution? Is it true thata great many state officials have been invited to the execution? What's Gilmore going to have for his last meal? When they said, "A blessing for us, too." He said, "Si, si, tutti-frutti, tutti-frutti." # First year they had me puttin' wheels on Cadillacs # # Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by # # And sometimes I'd hang my head and cry # # 'Cause I always wanted me o ne that was long and black # # One day I devised myself a plan # # That should be the envy of most any man # # I'd sneak it out there in a lunchbox in my hand # # Now, gettin' caught meant gettin' fired... # Oh! Hey, Doug. # Can't stop the pain # # I don't want to see you at all... # # Looking at you while you're looking at me # # I'm happy you do # # You're sure good-looking # # You're good enough for me # # And you're so good, woman # # You're just too good for me # # Couldn't love you, boy, you couldn't love her # # They were off and ran for cover # This execution is a brutalizing horror and a dangerous precedent. Who can justify it? This is judicial homicide. Your Honor, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Mr. Gilmore has "intelligently waived his right to appeal." That should remove any doubt in the mind of the court. Now, the State asks that Ms. Canfield's request for stay be denied. It is true. Mr. Gilmore did say, "I do not want to appeal." But that does not release the State of Utah from undertaking a mandatory review of this case. Right now, we don't know whether the Utah death penalty statute is or is not in contravention to the U.S. Constitution, since it hasn't been examined by the U.S. Supreme Court. In addition, public funds are being spent for the purpose of executing Gary Gilmore. Unlawfully spent. The Utah death penalty statute has not been held unconstitutional by any court, and... If I may, Your Honor. Ms. Canfield is attempting to stop an execution, not the wrongful expenditures of taxpayers' funds. Thank you, Mr. Dorius. Say, Al? Al? Al, the warden wants us to proceed as though the execution is on. So everyone, uh, you'll all have to say good-bye to Gary Gilmore, now. Have you heard from Denver? No, there's no word, but if they do overturn Ritter, we don't want to be caught sitting on our hands, okay? You been really great, you know that? So long, Gary. So long, Gary. Good luck to you. See ya, Gary. You're all right, man. Really. Bob. So long. Don. Uncle Vern. They overturned Ritter. It's on! It's on! Hey, it's on. It's on? Oh, wait a minute. Hey, you guys. Get up, it's on. It's on. All right, come on, it's on. What's happening? Get a shot of that. Wake up, wake up! It's on, it's on! It's over there, huh? We getting this? Yeah. # Too many roads I've been... # Leave it on, please. # Too many times # # I done kicked my body down, and I don't know # Sure you want me to leave this on? Yes. # Too many hits, miles and miles around # # Too many times, I done kicked my body down # # I don't know if I can get it up to get it on again # Stand over here. Not too tight, you son of a bitch. Gary wants to speak to you. Come on, Vern, I'll give you ago. Come on, come on. Gary, I could pull you right out of that chair. Would you? Come on. Having been found guilty of the crime of criminal homicide, murder in the first degree, by a jury of his peers, and the defendant having been given the election to determine the mode of death as provided in Section 77-36-16 of the Utah Code, annotated 1953, as amended, and he, having elected to be put to death by shooting, the warden of the Utah State Prison is hereby ordered to execute said judgment of death on the 17th day of January 1977. Do you have anything you'd like to say? Let's do it. Depart, oh, Christian soul, out of this sinful world. In the name of God the Father, Almighty, who from nothing created thee. In the name of his son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who suffered and died on the cross for thee. In the name of God, the Holy Spirit who sanctified thee. Let peace be your abode. We send you forth with a blessing. In the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Dominus vobiscum. Et cum spiritu tuo. Everybody can leave now. # I'm riding the big blue ball # # I never did dream # # I would fall # # But even the day that I do # # I'll jump off # # And smile back at you # # We don't even know where we are # # They tell us we're circling a star # # Well, I'll take their word # # I don't know # # But I'm dizzy # # So maybe that's so... # Come on. Is this is where our Mommy is? Let's go.
