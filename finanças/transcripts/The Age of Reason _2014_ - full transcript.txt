Summer sucks. What're you talkin' about? Summer doesn't suck, it's the best time of the whole year. It used to be, but now that school's over, it just goes on forever. Yeah, well, now we have like, all the time in the world. And time is money, so now we're like super rich. If we're super rich, how come you wear the same shirt every day? Hey, I like this shirt. So you're a mega millionaire, you can do whatever you want, and you're just gonna move out of your dad's house - and buy a car? - I'd buy a really cool car. I guess if I could do anything, I'd buy my own baseball team. Okay, yeah and I'd be like manager, so I could be like, "what're you, blind? "You were safe by a mile!" And I'd be closing pitcher. - I'd shut 'em down every night. - Not while I'm manager. You're benched for long hair and a bad attitude. You can't bench me, I'm the owner. Look, if I'm gonna manage this team, I gotta do it my way. You should use one foot, man. Look, man, I have two feet, so if I use both, I could just learn how to drive twice as good as everyone else all right? Just keep one foot on the gas and don't take it off. - Well, when do I let go? - When you wanna stop! I wanna stop at my house. Your house is that way. Look, man, I know where my house is, okay? I just gotta learn how to drive forward before I can learn how to drive in reverse. So, there's gonna be a tryout, Monday. For what? For the majors. Well, where's it at? Nashville. Oh, man, I wish I could've seen your dad flip out, when you asked to use the car. I didn't, but I gotta get him to sign some waiver 'cause I'm under 21, so I can be eligible. Just forge it. This isn't a report card. Yeah, well, I told you to use your left hand. You know, like me? Disguise your penmanship. But you're left-handed. When'd you get new neighbors? New neighbors? Watch it! Oh, shit! Frank, did you hear that? Everybody stay inside. - Back up! - Stop yelling at me! Go, man. I can't. The hell are you doin'? Watch the arm, man. Give me that! Ruby, call the cops, now! Looks like you got it under control, Frank. Get your mother to call the cops! Get your mother to call the cops. Somebody's mother better call the cops! Dialing. Look, I can buy you another mailbox! Can I talk to the cops? He doesn't even know what cops are. Yeah, I do, they have guns. I pay the mortgage on this house, so the last thing I need are a couple of punks tearing it to shambles, before I get a chance to unpack my dinette table. "Move to the suburbs, Frank. "It'll be good for the kids, Frank. "You'll love it, Frank." Why are you calling me, Frank? Hey, I'd watch it, man. - Gwen, get in the house. - That's Oz Ventura. He could throw so fast, you'll have to squint your eyes so they don't catch fire. So, what're you, his manager? Huh? Do you have big guns? "Best school district in the state," my ass. When I grow up, I'm gonna have loads of guns. Ruby, put a shirt on! Freddy! Mom! I can't study when you're making those stupid Pina Coladas! God, it ruins my vibe! What, do you want me to make smoothies while you're in Pilates? No, of course not! Ruins your concentration! Oh, shit, man. - Have you seen my glove? - I don't know, maybe? I think I left it in the car. Yeah, whatever, we'll get it or somethin'. Tomorrow. Freddy? What? What were you doing out so late? Nothing, geez. Out all hours of the night? Hold it, mister. Aren't you forgetting something? - Let me see your eyes. - Why? - Let me see your eyes! - Stop! Uh, Tom is spending the night. - Who's Tom? - Freddy, you are filthy! When was the last time you did your laundry? When was the last time you did my laundry? Do your laundry. But I don't know how. Sorry about that. Kayli? What's wrong? Daddy won't wake up. He was in his chair, I was trying to wake him up to show him my front walkover, why won't he wake up? He's just sleeping. He's not sleeping. He's sleeping really hard, okay? He's dead. He's not dead. Then wake him up, Oz. Robert. Oz. Hey. Oh. What time is it? Did work call? Tell 'em I'm sick. It's fine, it's night time. Oh. Hey, don't let me sleep in. I got a lot of work to do, okay? Don't worry, Dad, you got nothin'. Huh? Hey. I got you. Come on, I'll tuck you in. Oz, are you leaving? No. You're not gonna go play baseball? No. I'm gonna stay here and take care of you. What're you gonna do, besides that? Get a job or somethin'? But you're not good at anything, except baseball. Yeah, well, sometimes you gotta do stuff, even if you're not good at it. Life's just a bunch of stuff you don't wanna do. You'll figure that out when you get older. Mommy. Yes, Tyler? Can I kill it? - Kill what? - The monster in the tree. You can try. Die, die, die! You see something you like? Geez, you scared the shit outta me. I saw you yesterday, that was some fancy driving. Yeah. So, you new, or what? What? You know, I don't know you, so... Your shoes are untied. So, you know, I think I would've known you, if you were here and you weren't new. Well, who are you? Freddy. You live around here? Yeah. Nextdoor. Here. Loop de doo, tie it up. Pull it tight and then get it. Ruby? Give me a hand. God, Frank, can't you see that I'm helping my new unfortunate friend tie his shoes? Just cut the crap. Grab a box, you've been draggin' ass all day. Fine, if you don't want me to make new friends, then I won't make new friends. Hey, Freddy, my mom's new husband says to screw off. Okay, see ya around, later. Ruby. So, Freddy, is it? That was you last night, wasn't it? Neighbor. The car, the mailbox, that was all just a mistake, right? An accident? You know, 'cause accidents happen and I'd hate for us to get off on the wrong foot over an... Okay, see that was no accident! Kids. Drive me nuts. Oh, yeah, bills. - Hello? - Daddy, hi! Hey, Ruby, how'd the move go? You get your room all set up? I hate it here, this place totally blows! I wish I could just come home, why can't I stay with you? Ruby, why don't you just settle down, and try to make some friends before school starts? Don't worry about me. We can figure out a good time for you to come and visit. When? - Soon. - Promise? It's a deal, and Ruby? Yeah? You know, Frank's not such a bad guy. You should give him a chance. Don't do anything stupid like run away again and give your... Shit. Why are you sneaking out? Where are you going? Nowhere, don't worry about it. Well, when will you be back? When you stop being annoying. Freddy. So glad you could stop by for lunch. What're you doing here? I live here, that's what I'm doin' here. Aren't you supposed to be at like work, or somethin'? What would you know about "work, or somethin'," huh? It's Saturday. So what? Hey, Oz is in his room. What, is he like packing or? He's packing heat, packing sardines, packing... You know, Nashville tryouts, like baseball? Hey! I'm gonna start lockin' this house! Hey, you hear me? You're not gonna have much luck. What's that supposed to mean? Look around you. People here drive their car straight into the garage, close the door and shut out the world. They sure as hell aren't gonna stop for you. 10 bucks says I get a ride. Yeah? Good luck with that. We're gonna have a talk to your father, man to man! - I don't have a father, man! - Well, we'll see. Let me go! Come on! Look, no one's home, man! No one's home, huh? No one's home. - What do you want? - I'm your new neighbor, okay? Just moved in, the name's Frank. I don't care, get your hands off my son. - Your son! - Yeah. Has been wreaking havoc on my property. Looks like you've been wreaking havoc on my son. Yeah, man, all sorts of havoc! Looks to me like we might have to involve the authorities! Yeah and tell them about the havoc. Okay, now listen, you got the whole wrong idea. Your son has been destroying my property since I moved into the neighborhood. - Frederick! - Don't call me that, man. Is this true? Don't lie to me! - Son. - Yes, sir. Frederick's father. Yeah, he trashed my lawn and my mailbox. Whatever, man. Mailbox, well, that's not good. How's he gonna get his mail-order brides or whatever? What? Son, you get in here right now! You know the drill! I'm gonna beat the shit outta you and make you... - Eat worms. - Eat worms! For messing with this guy's mailbox! Don't worry! I'm gonna like punish him, a lot. Hey, man, call me Frederick again and see what happens. Hey, man, it was all part of the act! Hey, what're you doin' with that? So what, you just like go into people's houses, and like, go through their junk when they're not even home? I mean, weren't you taught any like manners or nothin'? Raised in a barn, what can I say? You could say whatever you want. Hey, man, you wanna see something cool? I found this thing, you know, and it was like, in the street and I was like, "what the hell?" You know, like people throw out cool shit, you know? I mean, it weighs like, 80 pounds or somethin'. Took me like half an hour to get back here. You want first swing, man? I mean, you could have it, if you want. No. What about you? I'm good. Hey, man, you think I'm like, qualified? For what, like the minors? Like a job. Well... What kinda job? I don't know. Repairman? What do you repair? Televisions. Well, I got a television right here, man, I mean, you can fix it, if you want. Yeah, I don't know. Look, man, you want the job or not? Freddy, you dingle-wad, I already saw you right there! It's Billy, man. You think he knows you messed up his car? I know you messed up my car, Freddy! Get out here, face me like a man! You get out here and face me like a man! You're such a freakin' pain in the ass! Oh, god, it smells like garbage. Oz, what up? Watch it, man. Hello. Hi. Funny thing happened to me yesterday. I was comin' home from school and I parked my car in the driveway to go write my essay on animal communication. You talk to animals at college? It's a G.E. Anyway, as I was sayin', I was writing my essay for an-comm and I go outside and I realize my car's been completely demolished. It couldn't have been that bad. - How would you know? - What's your problem, man? You screwed up my car, Freddy. Why would I wanna screw up your car? 'Cause you're a screw-up, Freddy, and that's all you do. Is you screw things up. Listen, man. Anyone could've stole your car. Got it? You're gonna pay. What, you don't have insurance? I got ass-kicking insurance, Freddy. So, pay up, or I kick your ass. Yeah? Go and try it. I will. Tonight, dump. Eight o'clock. Be there. Oz. Late. Later. Do you guys think that he'd really call the cops? I don't know, I mean, he's got no proof, so like, what's he gonna say? He's got my glove. Yeah, but it's a glove, right? Lots of people have gloves, I mean, Billy Walker probably has tons of gloves. I'm talkin' about tons of gloves, I'm talkin' about my glove. Well, did you put your name on it? - No. - Then how's he gonna know? I don't know, but I still need it, okay? You guys are cute. Don't call me cute, I'm not cute. Okay, you're not cute. Do you have anything to eat here? I got some stuff at my place. Oz. Hey, man, where's the, uh... The what? Nothin', I got it. You don't have any more ingredients? I need like ketchup. Always yellin'! Hey, you know what? I was just like you. I mean, just like you. I don't know, I'm one of a kind. Whoa, so was I. Come on, Kayli, let's go inside. But you and I, you know, we're practically the same. Hey, your sister's really good. Hello. Hi. So are you here to give my son direction in his life? Lay off, man. Put your hand on me like that, I'm your father. Um, you're out of bananas. And peanut butter. I don't care, outside. - Ruby, come watch me... - Oh, oh. Hey, honey. - What's going on? - Oh, nothing. Nothing's going on, we're um, just go outside and play. - What's wrong? - I said nothing's wrong. Now just, come on. Are you gonna eat all that? Come on, Kayli, let's go outside, sweetie. Hey. You. Leave. You sit down. You stay. I gotta go pee. Leave. Good. - Oh, my god. - Wow. Kayli, let's go to the front yard. Thank god. I'm glad to see you're not dragging that baseball glove. Are you supposed to drink with those? These? No, different meds for different ailments. This is for baboom-baboom, my heart, huh? This is for my, oo, soul. Oz, I knew what you're up to. It is a huge mistake. - I'm not up to anything. - Oh, cut the crap. You're plannin' on going playing baseball. That's what you're plannin' on doin', I'm not stupid. Hey, how fast can you throw the ball? I don't know! Exactly. So what? Okay, listen, smart guy. Ask any five-year-old what he wants to be when he grows up. What's he gonna say, what's he gonna say? Okay, I'll tell ya, nine out of ten times, they say they wanna be astronauts. Now, I myself, I don't know any astronauts. Now, how many astronauts do you know? I'm not five! Well, you certainly hell act like you're five. You behave like you're five and you piss like you're five! Are we taking your dad's car? Hey, man, can I drive? Does your dad know you're leaving? Don't know how he found out. I'm not goin' anyway, let's go! Wait, you're not leaving? No, man, I can't just leave you here to rot by yourself. So, what're we doing? Driving. What're you doin'? Sitting. Did you wanna like go somewhere or somethin'? Isn't that the point? There's nowhere to go. You don't know that until you get there. Yeah, Oz, live a little. So, what's cool around here? I don't know, there's like a dump outside of town. Some people say it's haunted. No one says it's haunted. Well, no one says it isn't haunted. What do you do there? Um, break stuff? Throw stuff. Kick stuff. It's almost eight. So what? Billy's gonna be at the dump. Well, sometimes they leave the lights on at the baseball diamond. We could go there. Let's check it out, I've got an idea. Does this idea involve like kicking or breaking or throwing? 'Cause if so, we've already thought of that. Found you. Don't worry, I found Freddy first. Freddy, you're it! Better start counting! One. Two. Three. Shouldn't we split up? He'll be expecting it, come on! Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14, 15. Ready or not, here I come! They're on a timer. I wanna see you play. Why? I don't know, I wanna see you do something you're good at, and even though baseball's usually boring, I get to eat nachos. What if they're outta nachos? Then it'd just be boring. Well, then I'd get a hot dog. Plus, it would be fun 'cause I'd get to see you play. I don't need a fan club. You were right, we should've split up. Look, maybe I just don't like people watching me when I play, you know? Well, maybe you're not that good. See the hole in that fence? My dad cut that. Said when I can stand on that mound and throw the ball through the hole, then I'll know I'm good enough. And did you do it? It's a trick. The hole's too small. The ball can't fit. Found you. This game sucks. I should be getting home anyways. You gonna pay up, all star? You owe me 10 bucks. How's that? Someone picked me up. Your shoes are untied. So? I like 'em like that. Lets my feet breathe. Busted. Ruby, are you trying to give your mother gray hair? I think you're doing fine on your own. You know what? You need to show your mother some respect. - Young lady. - Frank, I'll handle this. Why didn't you answer your phone? It must've been on silent. And what were you doing with that boy? Frank. What's that supposed to mean? I saw you outside. What were you doing with that Freddy kid? Tying his shoes. Okay, you know what? You may think you're funny, but you are now grounded. What, I mean, she is, isn't she? Frank, let me deal with her. I need to be part of this family junk, because the kids won't respect me, otherwise. Maybe I shouldn't leave tomorrow. No, no, no, no, that's ridiculous. I can handle it. Goodnight, Dad. I can do a back handspring, do you wanna see? - Maybe later. - Why not now? 'Cause I gotta go. Can I come? No. What happened to your glasses? Stay out of my room, okay? Oz, wait, just watch me do my back handspring. Please? You're pretty good at that. You wanna try? I don't think I'm cut out for that kinda stuff. You won't know until you try! Little man, come on over here and say goodbye to your mother. Mom, why can't I come with you? Ruby, come here. Die, monster, die! I want you to listen to Frank. He's in charge, okay? Okay. And wipe some of that lipstick off. It makes you look cheap. Kid, you can't kill a tree with water. It's just gonna drink it up. You're stupid. - You're stupid. - Drive safe. - You're stupid. - You're the stupid one. Trees like water. You're soakin' wet. - Eat water! - Tyler, don't spray the boy! Now you're wet and stupid. Ruby. I don't want you near him, you understand me? Been playin' in the sprinklers? What's that supposed to mean? You're all wet. Yeah, I know. - Well, what happened? - Nothing. So, you're just minding your own business and all of a sudden you're sopping wet? No. Look, I need to talk, okay? Okay? Well, did you ever feel like everything you do is like, wrong? Oh, Freddy. People do all sorts of things, and there are a million ways to do things, and not all of those can be the right things, you know? My shoes keep coming untied. Are you on drugs? What? No. - Look at me. - Mom, stop! Sometimes I just, I feel like I'm a screw-up or something. Freddy, you don't have to get screwed up - to have a good time. - That's not what I'm saying! Just listen to me. I am. Okay, well like, I'm tryin' to talk to you and... Freddy. Why are you wet? Why don't you just ask your boyfriend? Tom? What do you mean? Just forget it. Tom, do you know why Freddy's wet? One foot in front. Put your hands down and go over into a split. - And do a split? - Oh. - A side split. - Side split, okay. I don't know what that is. Like this. That was great. So why don't you come in here and, uh, jump around and make me some coffee, okay? Okay! Hey, uh, how about we have a good old fashioned family dinner tonight, huh? You don't cook, ever. Well, tonight, I do. I just wanna get the family together and lay all our cards out on the table. What do you think? It's up to you. Yeah, sure. Yeah? Great. What? Your mom wants to know why you're wet. Yeah? Well, maybe I just wanna be wet. Did you think of that? Look, man, I could care less if you're wet or not. You could be covered from head to toe in petroleum jelly, for all I care. You mean it? Yeah. It's not here. Well, maybe he hid it somewhere. Where would he hide it? I don't know, like the glove compartment? Nothin'. Look, I don't know what he's bitchin' about, though. I mean, he's got like tons of insurance in there. Let's get outta here. Hey, hey, hey! Get the hell away from my car, you chickenshit ass munch! You never showed! What's up, Oz? Look, man, I don't know what you're talking about. Shut up. I waited all night at the dump just to kick your sorry butt. Where were you? I was at the baseball field. Yeah, man, like you said. "Baseball field, eight o'clock." Yeah, yeah, like you said. No. I said dump. Yeah, that's 'cause he likes to dig around in trash. Think you idiots need to clean out your ears. - God, I just wanna hit you. - Hey! - Right in your stupid face! - Hey! Look at him, he's stupid. Did you find a baseball glove in your car? Glove? I need it, Billy. Look, man, you wanna fight, then let's do it! Let's do it, right now! Come on, you don't have to wait on account of me. - Now? - All talk, huh? Look, man, I got class in 15 minutes! I'm not takin' another D for nobody! Can you believe this tool? Attendance is mandatory, so be there, at the baseball field tonight and we'll fight. We'll show, you just bring the glove. Okay, so don't vag out on me like last time, or I'll come and find you. I can be relentless. You're gonna bring it, right? Oh, yeah, I'll bring it. Enjoy your last day on Earth. Probably spend the whole time pickin' each other's boners. He's a buffoon. Ruby? Ruby! Tyler! - What? - Have you seen your sister? I don't, I don't know. Turn my back for one second. Man, I thought Billy used to be our friend. I mean, I know we always used to make fun of his harelip and all but geez. - Cowlick. - He changed, man. He used to be cool. Guess that's what happens when you go to community college. Aren't you afraid you're gonna get some sort of like flesh-eating disease from digging around in the trash? Ruby? Hello, Ruby? No. Who's this? Freddy. Oh, I should have known. Freddy, the neighborhood ball sack. Who is this? Just put Ruby on the phone. Uh... She's not here. Look, I'm not stupid. Who are you? Her father! - Sort of. - Oh, then you're wrong. You are stupid. Who's that? My asshole neighbor. Ruby's dad? Sort of. High school was long enough. Like, waiting for death row or something. Minus the conjugal visits. Time probably moves slowly when you're waiting to die. Just like, thinking of everyone you killed. Maybe it goes super fast. 'Cause you know it's all the time you got left. Maybe we should call like Ted Bundy or somethin', - and ask him. - Hey, boys! Ted Bundy's dead. Freddy! You look nice and... Dry. What, now you want me to be wet? Hop in, I'm making an early dinner. I just ate nachos. So you don't have any room for meatloaf? What about you, Oz? I can't, I got a family dinner tonight. Maybe we should start doing something like that. Hey, mutt. Thanks. Tom doesn't know why you were wet. Freddy, if something's going on with you, you can tell me, it's okay. Nothing's going on. Okay. It's just that you've been so quiet. You hardly ever say a word to me anymore. I never know what you're doing, where you go, who you're hanging with. Do you have new friends, is that it? I don't have any friends. Billy Walker's always been such a nice boy. And if you did have friends and those friends were doing something that made you feel uncomfortable, then they're not good friends. I know it can be hard when everyone else is doing something. There's a lot of pressure to join in, and then there's that curiosity. You know Frank. He's offered to give us a little help. I would've stopped! Relax, I'll find him. Hey! - Come on, kid, let's talk! - Shit. Who's there? Cut the bull, Freddy, I know that's you. There's no Freddy here. Stop doing that idiotic voice and get out here. Christ, I'm not gonna hurt ya, I just wanna find Ruby. There's no Ruby here, you got the wrong house. Open the god damn door! Uh, my mistake, sir, I didn't mean to disturb you. Well, you have. You haven't seen a kid around here, have you? No kids, no animals, no insects. No one comes in my house, but me. I think I saw a boy climb through your window. Well, that would be trespassing, wouldn't it? I guess it would. I shoot trespassers. I shoot kittie cats and I shoot puppy dogs. Now, leave me alone before I shoot you. Tyler, I'm not going to tell you again. Stay inside. Thank you. What's wrong? I'm not that fast. Could've fooled me. I take it you got a thing for planes? Nope. Could've fooled me. It's kinda cute. Don't say that. Say what? Cute, don't call me that. Don't call me cheap. I didn't call you cheap, I called you fast, and you are. You're like a bolt of lightning. Sounds kinda cute. I used to build these with my dad. I wanted to build cars. He always brought home planes, so that's what we built. Then he had a stroke, he couldn't keep his hands still, so it didn't matter anyway. Well, it's nice he wanted to spend time with you. My dad won't even answer the phone. That guy's a jerk-off. Who, Frank? Frank's not a jerk-off, he's an idiot. And he's not my dad, he's my step-dad. My dad lives in Nashville. Well, near Nashville. Well, at least he's not breathing down your neck all the time, reeking of whiskey, making you take care of your sister. She really listens to you. You'd make a good dad. Slow down there. Oz, why's your door closed? None of your business. Oz, you have a girl in your room. I did. Now I have two girls and that's one too many, so get out. Cute. Oz, this is tomorrow! Yeah. In Nashville. - So? - Are you gonna go? Yeah, I gotta get my glove but yeah, I'm going. Are you nervous, are you excited? What's the difference? I wanna see you try out. I don't know if they let people watch that kinda thing, you know? How long are you gonna be gone? When are you taking off, how are you getting there? I don't know, I just kinda decided to go this morning. Oz, we gotta figure this stuff out. Can we take your dad's car, do we need to take the bus? Stuff like that. We don't have to figure out anything. Come on, I'm ready to get the hell outta here. - Let's figure this out. - You just got here. Besides, I don't wanna have to worry about anyone else. You won't have to worry about me, and plus, my dad lives in Nashville, so we can stay at my dad's house. I thought your dad didn't want you around? I said he didn't answer my calls, not that he didn't want me around. What's the difference? There's a difference, okay? And plus, he's not gonna turn away me and my boyfriend. This is why people think you're like... Don't call me fast. I wasn't gonna call you fast. I was gonna call you cheap. Fine. You know what? We're breaking up. Were we going out? Out! Freddy. Oh, my god. - What, what? - Look at your arm. - You're bleeding, that's what. - I'm fine, just stop. No, we have to get you cleaned off. I'm fine, just let me... Freddy, you have to learn to take care of yourself. Mom, just stop, just stop! No, let's just get you cleaned off first. Mom, I need to ask you something. What, you have my attention, what is it? It's like, high school's over. And it's not like I was good at it or nothin', but like, you know, they told you what needed to happen, and all these things that you needed to do and I hated that, you know, like I hated that more than anything. You know, teachers always telling you to sit down and like be quiet and show your work and they call you dumb 'cause you don't feel like lugging around a 50-pound biology book all day and... Go to a community college. They don't care what kinda grade you had in high school. No, Mom, I'm just sick of school. I just, I wanna do something I'm good at. - Well, you're good at things. - Like what? Well, remember when you used to ride around on your tricycle all around the neighborhoods, and you used to smile and wave at me with one hand? Oz is good at like baseball and like, girls and driving, you know? Well, some people are better at some things than other people. They have a talent, they're born with it, but everyone's good at something. I just don't wanna rot. Oh, Freddy, don't be ridiculous. You said it yourself, I need to take care of myself. I'm like rotting, I'm like turning into garbage and I don't know what to do, I mean, what should I do? I don't know, Freddy. You're an adult, I can't tell you what to do. Adults figure things out on their own. I know, okay? How about you figure out something for yourself for a change? You never could do anything without Oz. Oz is my friend! I know, but like you said, he's doing something, isn't he? He's good at things. He's not gonna be hanging around forever. Just shut up! And then you're gonna be on your own, - and then what're you gonna do? - I don't know, okay? Well, it's time to figure it out! I can't hold your hand forever. Freddy, what are you doing? Put that down. Freddy, I mean it, do you hear me? This is my house! This is my house, too. No, Freddy, you just live here. Yeah, well not anymore. What's the problem? Nothing. It looks to me like there's a problem. I'm okay. Young people, you're always okay. You're never good or bad, fine or not, you're just okay. The thing is, okay doesn't really mean anything. Okay's just something people say so that they don't have to say anything else. Okay? Thanks. Now get off my grass, I just had it mowed yesterday. Nice plumage. What? Your flower. Plumage is feathers. Yeah, well. You know, when a peacock is displaying its plumage, it's lookin' for a mate. I'm not a peacock. Well, are you lookin' for a ride home? I live right there. We could take the scenic route. Hey! Dinner's almost ready. You said you were gonna cook. Oh, your mother always done the cookin'. Yeah, I know. Come on, don't do this. Look, there's chopsticks and stuff. Dad, I want you to do somethin' for me. Honey. It's dinner time, okay? Please just sit down. There you go. What's this stuff? Food. I wanna talk now. Oh, god. Okay, we'll talk over the food, come on. Nothin' like a little chow to get the juices flowin', huh? Nothin' like a little juice, either. Right, who's gonna say grace, huh? Seriously? Yes, seriously. We're about to eat and I think we should give thanks. Hm? Oz, why don't you lead us in the prayer? You used to love this stuff, come on. That was a long time ago. Please, Oz? Yeah, please? Good food, good meat... Good God, let's eat! Amen. Dad. Isn't this nice, huh? This is nice, isn't it? We're all together as a family, sittin' here. Dad, I'm leaving. Why don't you shut up and eat your kung pao? I'm goin' to Nashville to try out for baseball. Kayli, why don't you give your brother his fortune cookie? - Kayli, go to your room. - Oz. Don't tell your sister what to do. Kayli, go to your room. Honey? Open your fortune cookie. - Dad. - Fine, I'll open mine. Let's see. Wow. "Your unappreciative son will neglect the fact "that you still have no gainful employment, "nor any way to stay afloat, and instead he's going "to throw away his life and the life of his family's "to pursue the hopeless dream of playing... "Major League Baseball." Oz, please. Stop this nonsense of runnin' away to play games. It's time for you to be part of the real world, you know? You're not goin' to be a Major League Baseball player. You're not, like you're just gonna be like everybody else. I'm not gonna be like you. You lost your job because you're a drunk. You shouldn't... You shouldn't speak to your father like that, you know. Dad. I'm goin' to Nashville. Okay. How're you gonna get there, kid? I'll figure it out. Uh, grab all your stuff and meet me back here in one hour, and then we'll take off for good. Nashville. Bright lights, big city. So, is your dad gonna be cool with me goin'? My dad isn't gonna turn down his daughter and her boyfriend. No, yeah. Of course. Thanks. Yeah. Spyder. No, yeah, Billy, from class. I need a huge, huge favor. Figures. Tyler? Tyler, come here. Uh-uh. What's wrong? The monster. Billy? Where's my glove? I've been waitin' for ya, Freddy. I ain't Billy, but that don't matter. Billy Walker's the one that got me through intro to econ, which happens to be a pre-rec. Billy Walker tells me to come down here, because some joker jacked up his ride. So here I am. Look, man, I'm not Freddy. I just wanna get my glove and get outta here. Okay, you're not Freddy, that's cool. Show me some ID and I'll be on my way. Why are you wasting my time? You're making it harder on yourself. Don't you know I got places to be, I've got a life? What the hell? Freddy! Where's Billy? Billy's not here, man! Come on, Billy, show yourself! Help! Come out, Billy, I know you're here! What the hell, man? - Where were you? - I was comin', I was late! - What's your problem, man? - Don't "man" me, you dick! I'm not fighting for you anymore! So what, you just gonna fight me 'cause I was late? That guy could've broke my arm! All I want is to get my glove and get the hell outta here! I didn't come here to fight no one! So why are you fighting me? What if you go to Nashville and don't get picked up? Then what? You're just gonna end up right back here. How do you even know you're good enough? I don't know. But I gotta find out. Well, you can't leave without your glove. Ruby! Tyler! Ruby, I thought I lost you. Shh! - Look. - The monster. - The what? - The monster in the tree. - What monster? - Shh. You guys stay put. Frank. Frank, where are you going? Come on. Frank! Just stay back. - What're you gonna do? - I'm gonna kill the monster. - Monster. - You have a gun? Yeah, I have a gun. It's my constitutional right, second amendment. - Oh, I want a gun. - It's not a real gun. - It's a real gun, Ruby. - I want a gun. - It's a BB gun. - It still shoots. - It shoots BBs. - It's a real gun, Ruby. Oh, I want a gun. Tyler, you can have your own gun when you get older. It's his constitutional right. Besides, someone needs to kill the monsters. - I want that gun. - It's a toy gun. - Frank! - Whoa. Frank, kill the monster. Okay, just relax, I can handle it. Oh, my gosh. Good shot. What the hell is that thing? Wowzers. I'm beat. Better turn in. Thanks, Frank. Ruby. Thanks for bein' there, for Tyler. He needs all the help he can get. Whoa, no, no, don't play with it. I'm just gonna flip it over. Hello, old man? You home? No one's here. Bizarro. It's pretty cool, huh? I mean, look at all this junk. Let's just get the glove and get outta here. Yeah. It was, um, over here. Uh... Junk. Junk. Oh, hey, check it out. Cut it out. That's "cut it out, sir," soldier, to you. Now, drop and give me 20. All right, we'll, find the glove. Geez. Heads up. - What're you doing? - Just playin' some ball, man. Yeah. Look, whatever, it's just a bunch of junk, all right? I mean, see? Junk. Watch it! Seen my glove anywhere? No. Who's there? Freddy! Stay outta here! Come out, thief. I know you're here, you tried to sneak out the window. You can't hide, thief. Stop! Stop right there! Turn around, thief, let me get a look at you. Oz. Oz! Your friend's long gone, boy. So what do you have to say for yourself, thief? Speak! Speak! I'm sorry. I'm sorry about all your junk. Junk? There's no junk here! These are my collections! These are my possessions! There's no junk! What're you looking for? I've caught you, boy. I could shoot you right now and nobody would bat an eye for the life of a thief. Oz is coming back. A thief and a liar. What're you holdin' there, show it to me, what is that? It's just a glove. "Just a glove?" It's my glove, you're stealin' my glove! It's not yours. You stole it. I did no such thing. I know you did. You probably stole everything in this room. You shut up! No, you shut up. You're not gonna shoot me. Why the hell not? Because you're old. That's why. Go ahead, take it all, take all the junk! Look, I already have the glove. I don't want anymore junk. Nothing? Hey. Are you awake? No. Look, Kayli. I'm sorry. I know, but I'm gonna miss you. Well, I'm gonna come back for you. After you get drafted? Yeah. After I get drafted. Just promise not to hate me, okay? I fixed 'em. Good as new. Dad. Come on, get up. You're coming with me. - Right now? - Right now. What about Dad? Dad said it's okay. Okay. Ruby! Ruby! Hey, man. I can't believe you fell for that, dude. You broke my nose! You broke it! Hey, man. You gonna get in or you need me to open the door for ya? Nah, man. Nashville's more your thing. Are you sure? Sure, I'm sure. Your dad let you borrow the car? Yo, Oz. You gonna like pull Nashville off the map? Hell yeah. Hell yeah. I really think you broke my nose, Freddy. You're gonna pay. No, no, no, I was joking, I was joking!
