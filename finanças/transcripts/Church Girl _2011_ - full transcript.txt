A day I will never forget. It was crazy at The Sapphire that night, and, I mean, although the police had been there many times before, that night, it was just... it was different. How did a preacher's daughter, raised in the church her entire life, end up in a situation like this? I mean, how did I get here? My name... is Emily Franklin and this is my story. ♪ Holy ♪ Most holy and everlasting Father ♪ ♪ I'm blessed ♪ By you ♪ Father ♪ I had enough I had enough ♪ ♪ We ask of you ♪ Help your anointing Father ♪ ♪ Help your anointing Father ♪ ♪ On these ♪ Young ♪ Children ♪ Lord we ask that you cover ♪ ♪ Let your angels ♪ Walk beside them Lord ♪ ♪ Whoo ♪ Oh Lord oh God ♪ Beside them ♪ Let the spirit ♪ Walk up beside them ♪ ♪ Oh God, oh God ♪ Let them spirits all around them ♪ ♪ Every ♪ Every ♪ Every ♪ Every ♪ Woo ♪ Every day ♪ Day ♪ Oh ♪ Oh Lord, Lord ♪ Oh do it to them ♪ We believe you in church right now ♪ ♪ In the name of Jesus ♪ Whoa God ♪ Ooh I was 12 years old then. God knows we loved to sing, and that's exactly what we did. We sang and we sang. Some people came from everywhere, all over, just to hear my best friends, Kaleta, Amber and me sing. That's when we knew we had a gift. Mom always warned us that our gift could either be a blessing or a curse, and I didn't understand it then, but looking back on it, I'm so glad my family prayed for me. ♪ For the Bible ♪ Tells me so ♪ Jesus loves me ♪ This I know ♪ For the Bible ♪ Tells me so ♪ It tells me so ♪ Little ones ♪ To him belong ♪ They are weak ♪ But He is strong ♪ Yes ♪ Jesus loves me ♪ Oh yes ♪ My Jesus, my Jesus ♪ He loves me ♪ Yes my Jesus ♪ My God loves me ♪ For the Bible ♪ For the Bible ♪ Bible tells me ♪ So ♪ So Sunday morning at Redeeming Love Church where everybody is somebody and Jesus is the reason why.

Oh, oh. That beautiful lady right there is the honorable Maya J. Franklin, our pastor. That's my mama, y'all. And hear me when I tell you, nobody could preach like my mama. Have we had a good time in church today? [ALL] Yes! I feel the Holy Ghost is here today. [ALL] Yes! I feel the spirit in here and while I feel the spirit moving... I want to challenge you to be ready. Keep on your minds what we talked about today. Be ready, be ready, be ready. Don't get ready! Be ready. Because the Son of Man is coming back for a church without spite or wrinkles. I believe Matthew 24 and 44 says, "Therefore also be ready because you know not the hour that the Son of Man come." And when you think he's not coming, he's coming. Look at the events in the world, look at the disasters in the world. Deacon Sanders, will you be ready? Preachers, will you be ready? Oh, God! Choir, will you be ready? Yeah! I know I wanna be ready when He calls my name. We'll be blessed at service when the Lord finds us doing. "Pastor Maya, what do you mean by that?" Well, I'm talking about when he calls my name, I'm gonna be found singing. I'm gonna be found singing. I'm gonna be found singing! Oh bless the Lord. Oh my soul. I will continually have His praises on my lips. Oh, yes, Lord! Can the church say yes? Yes! Can the church say yes? Yes! Be ready, be ready, be ready, be ready, be ready! Yeah, come on! Hallelujah!

Girl, yes, and he is fine! Okay, where did you meet Mr. Fine? Girl, I was standing at the bus stop one day, right? And this big beautiful blue shiny Bentley pulled up on the side of me. Honey, he rolled down the window, I look in, he looked at me, told me I was fine enough to be a model and then he asked me if I needed a ride. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Please tell me you didn't get in the car. Hell yeah, I got in, he was ballin'! ♪ Lola ♪ You know it Hey, hey, stop it. Oh, sorry. You cannot be cussin' in the sanctuary. Forgive me, Jesus.

Okay, so how long have you known this guy? I can't hear nothing on this side. Whole eardrum gone. Gone. Amber? Huh? How long have you known this guy? Girl! Girl! Yeah. About a month. A month. That explains a lot, why you haven't been to church, Sunday school, choir rehearsal, we had a bake sale... See, that's why I don't tell you nothing, 'cause you always judging me. I'm not judging you, I'm just saying we miss you here at Redeeming Love. Okay, and I miss being at Redeeming Love. Girl, come on. There are so many memories for us here. Oh, my goodness, me, you and Kaleta, I can remember us growing up, we were a mess, girl. Yes. A hot mess. Sorry. What was that song we would break out into? Oh, when Mama came? The Clark Sisters!

What were the late nights together, the shopping sprees, the dinners, all of that, was that... was that all a lie? A lie, Amber? Now, less than a month ago, I found you at a bus stop with $5 in your pocket. I told you I would expose you to the finer things in life and I did that. I took you to places you had only dreamed about and dressed you in designers you couldn't even pronounce, and now I am giving you the opportunity of a lifetime. So tell me, in all of that, where is the lie? That's what I thought. Now... please remember, Amber. You can always go back to the bus stop. We have work to do, people, this is gonna be huge!

You just keep singing. [MAN] Just keep singing, baby. Keep singing. [EMILY] Jacob's words took me back to when my dad was the pastor of our church. I used to love when he would bring me up to sing with him. He made me feel so special, like I could do anything. Nobody could sing like my daddy. Now, baby, I brought you in here this morning with me because, first of all, I want to tell you how beautiful you are today. Your mother did your hair very, very nice. Thank you. Got your nice dress on and everything. And little earrings is blinding me in my eyes and stuff. It's all right. But you look very, very beautiful. But I brought you in here with me this morning because I want you to sing with me in service. Is that all right, huh? You wanna... you willing to let the Lord use you this morning? Yes.

I heard you the first time, Jacob, and I swear, if I hear you mention that girl's name one more time, I'm gonna slit my wrists. Are you serious? No, the question is, are you serious? I'm not blind, Jacob, and I'm not crazy. I see the way you look at her. It's the same way you used to look at me. You're out of control, Cat. I am not out of control. Do you understand what I have sacrificed to be with you? Do you? And, Jacob, I've given up everything. Everything... my friends... my family, my life. And I've done things for you that I would never do for another human being on this planet. I have put my life in jeopardy for you, Jacob. I have been there. It was me. I have been there, right there, by your side through things that would have destroyed any other woman and you know it. You know it, you know it, you know it. You wanna know what? I would do it all again. I would, I... I would do it over and over again because I love you. I love you, Jacob. It's me, I love you. Do you understand? Just listen to me, it's me, honey.

Who makes people say yes when everything in them wants to say no? I do. Stop it. Oh, God! And who has the power of life and death in his tongue? Jacob, you're hurting me. Open your damn mouth. No, you do, you do. Absolutely right, Cat, and you'd do well to never, ever forget it. Now, I'm gonna ask you again. Did you get Emily's measurements? No. But I'll take care of it right away.
