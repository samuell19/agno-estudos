A man burned to death at Pablo psychiatric hospital. The hospital claims the patient had no extraneous materials needed to start a fire, and no such materials were found at the site. Local investigators say all the evidence points out that the victim was burned from within, an uncommon phenomenon known as self-combustion. The local priest working with the patient informed us the patient claimed to be possessed by a spirit. The priest is quoted, saying, there is no natural explanation for something like this. I have failed him. - Oh. - Oh wow, look at that. - Unbelievable. - Wow, so pretty. Oh, she's gonna love that. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday dear Cora ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday dear Cora ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ - Oh! - Oh!

I just love it. It's going great. I'm working with this new artist out of New York. It's incredible but, he's very superstitious. He only paints on odd numbered days. That's strange. Religious thing, I don't know. But I'm telling you, he could be famous if I could just get him to focus and finish. - Religious or lazy? - Exactly. Yeah. I'm gonna get a cookie. So, how is Derek handling your hours. Amazingly well, at least that's what he tells me. I don't know, how do you deal with it? Cora! Cora! - Oh my god. - Cora. Cora, are you okay? - What happened? - What happened? I don't know. I find Cora in the water. I pulled her out. It's okay, I was just playing a joke on you guys. A joke? Fake drowning is not funny and you know it. She's fine. Look, you scared us half to death. She's fine. Come on, sweetie. - Oh, come on. - Did she hit her head, Leo? - Did you see? - Sorry, I didn't. Thank you. Thank god it's over. I'm exhausted. No, keep it on, I like it. I shouldn't have gotten so mad. No, I get it. She scared me, too. Maybe she wanted to be rescued by Leo. You mean she did it on purpose? Maybe. I don't know, if she's anything like I was, we are in so much trouble. Tell me about it. Mm, this is so good. Where'd you get it? I thought you got it? No. Must have been marta. I'm surprised so many of the neighbors came. Especially the ones across the street. - It's nice. - Yeah. I sure do love you. Cora. Come on hun. Wake up, we're late, chop chop. Hun, can you make sure she's up? Cora, let's go, honey. You gonna be home for dinner tonight? I have no idea what today looks like. Oh my god, Derek. What the hell happened? It's brand new. Power surge, or electrical short? I don't know. The whole house could have burned down. You should get going. - I'll call on the fridge. - Okay. Are you sure? Yeah, it's under warranty. They'll have to replace it. Wow. Cora, let's go. Come on, we're late. Let's go, go go go. Breakfast. I'm not hungry. You will be. Okay. Backpack. Apple is in your bag for later, okay? Bye. Have a good day. Let's go. Right, but this is from the sternoff collection. I've got this cache of Neo-realism beauties. All European. What else you got? Picked up a couple I think you might like. This new artist. No, this new artist I'm telling you about, he's incredible. What kind of stuff? Variety, Christian, iconic. No, I am telling you, he is the next walkdorfski. Get in early on this guy. All right, I'm getting another call. I gotta take this, okay? All right, bye. Hey babe. So what do you want to do for dinner tonight? Do you want to go out? Sounds good. Cor, you want to go out? Cora? Uh, maybe not. Maybe we'll stay home and watch a movie. - You sure? - Yeah, kind of. What do you think, veggie pizza? I'll let you get veggie. Uh, pepperoni and black olive. She's not coming down. She says she isn't hungry. - What? - Yeah. It's early. This is her favorite show. I know. When did she become a moody teenager? Boys. You saw how awkward she was around Leo. Yeah, he better watch it. Oh my god. What the hell was that? Stay here. No. Cora. Cora? - Oh. - Oh my goodness. You hit your head. I'm okay. Oh, come on. Let's get up on your bed here. Here we go. Okay. - Oh. - Oh, hey. - Oh, it's okay. - Hey. Hey, it's all right. - Bad dream. - I'm okay. Let me see, let me see. Oh. Up. Down. Down. Left. Right. Great. Tell me, did she have previous concussions? No. No. I don't know. Allergic reactions to medications? No. Well... we can do a ct scan... if you want. Cora, we are ready for you. This patient's alive? Yeah, I watched her walk into the room. But it might have changed. The machine has malfunctioned. We checked after the first round, it's working fine. No it's not. Let's run her again. Whiskey? Whiskey? Want to tell? One patient, a girl. Her ct is the same as... Will you be able to help her? The second shot was normal. Hmmm... that's it. How are you? My affairs? Nobody asks the bartender about his business. They tell him theirs. Cheers. Hey. It's okay. Hello? There you are. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Where are you? How come you're not at work? Shoot. What time is it? Time to be at work. - I overslept again. - It's crazy. The police are here. A lady went through the window. The little girls parents were pissed. First her cat scans kept changing, then she is in the room with a jumper, and they took the girl home. Stop talking, please. I'll be right in. All right, hurry up. Thank you, darya. Sorry. - There you are. - Oh, hey. What the hell is going on? I've been interrogated. Can you imagine? First time in my life. They've been asking me all those questions. Did I see anything? Did I hear anything? Hello, can I speak with mr or mrs Walters? This is he. Cora Walters' father. Yeah. This is Nina from the hospital. I just wanted to check in on your daughter. How is she? Not great after she saw that woman commit suicide. I'm so sorry about what happened. These incidents can be very traumatic for a child. I would like to come over for a formal visit. Is it okay? Sure. Kolya, hey! I told you! Hey... what's this! What's going on? This is a mess! You... come in... sorry! Come on, pick it up! Well, we have taps. Well, and who pays? It's from your salary. What have I got to do with it? I'm just stuck, that's all. - You can! Come on! Hey! - Ok. Hi, I'm Nina, from the hospital. Oh, oh, please come in. I'm so sorry about what happened. Oh, thank you. After the incident, we kind of left in a hurry. We didn't feel comfortable leaving Cora there. I understand. Can I see Cora's release documents? Oh, yes. Cat scan is. This is Nina from the hospital. Hi, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. Should we sit? Please. So, hysteria is a form of neurosis in which emotional disturbances can turn to physical problems. It could be related with family stress, death of a family member. Is anyone in your family ill? - No. - No. Then it could be hereditary. Any history of mental illness? Not that we know of. No. Then, it could be, as we call it, free floating. Which means it has no particular reason. Has Cora any kind of strange behaviors after she left the hospital? Um. Let me show you. Wow that's. She's a very sweet girl. This isn't like her. Does she walk in her sleep often? No, not at all. Not that I know of. Well, this could be, a night terror. What's that? A night terror is having feelings of intense fear in the middle of the night. Relatively common but usually at a younger age. The child appears to be awake, but actually they are in a dream state. They don't understand what they are doing. So what do you recommend we do. Right now, observation. We're not taking her back to the hospital. Actually, it's better for the patient to see him in his everyday environment. You mean here? Yes. Who would observe her? I can. If you're okay with that. Cora, do you like Ukrainian food? It's fine. So, what brought you to work in Ukraine? My grandparents were Ukrainian. Really? I was born in the states but we visited here a lot when I was a kid. One time I liked it so much I just decided to stay. What's your background, exactly? I studied here in Kiev, in bogomolets university. Then I worked in a sleep clinic for a few years in the United States. And then I came back to Ukraine. Why'd you come back? I thought I could help more people working here, in a hospital. And I got frustrated by the sleep clinics. They observe patients only in the clinic, but when it comes to sleep disorders, that's ineffective. You need to see the patients in their everyday sleeping environment. Cora, we've invited Nina to stay. - She's gonna. - I know. She's gonna watch me while I sleep. All of these paintings were here when we came. Which, some of them are very beautiful. Some of them, really good. Yeah, yeah. It was kind of cool to see them when we moved in. And towels for the bathroom. - Thank you. - Mm-hm. It's usually pretty warm in here, but if you need another blanket, they're in the closet. Can I get you anything else? I'm fine, thank you. Okay. Have a good night. I'll see you in the morning. See you tomorrow. Mom. It's okay. It's okay. Did you go into the wrong room? Come on, sweetie. Cora. Nina? What's going on? How was Cora? At around 3:00, Cora came into my room. She just stood there, staring. She was sleepwalking? Maybe. And honestly, I never seen anything quite like this. So, what do we do now? I recommend more observation. The hospital needs a report and, before I know more, I'm not sure what to tell them. Hey, come on in. Get you set up upstairs. What have you got in here? Cameras. I also put a camera in the hall so I can watch her. Night terrors occur between stages three and four of the sleep cycle. At that point, your body's temperature continues to decline as you head over to rem sleep. If the temperature is prevented from dropping properly, it can trigger a night terror. That's why I gave Cora a lighter blanket, and hopefully she'll agree to wear it with thinner pajama. Do night terrors run in your family? I have no idea, why? Usually it's hereditary. Has Cora had any anesthesia recently? No. Maybe she takes any medication like asthma or allergy? Not that I know of, why? Just all possible causes. And, we are on. I thought Cora was at home already. She's at school. Oh, they're here. Hey, how was school? As her. You gotta check this set up out, it's pretty cool. Okay. Okay go, upstairs. I'll be in my office if you need me. Hey, how's it going? Wow. Has Cora had any trouble adjusting to a new country? Well, with the school changes here and the house. Anything that might cause an anxiety. She likes it here. I mean, it's obviously been a bit more stressful lately, but. Derek said you work long hours. Yeah. How that goes, that makes an impact in your household. Problems with your marriage? No. I'm just trying to get a clear picture of Cora's home life. We're happily married. I know we joke about it, but do my long hours bother you? I don't know, what's the right answer? I can see that one going either way. The honest one. I miss you, but sometimes it's good to miss someone. Do you still think I'm hot? Of course. Prove it. I said, prove it. Prove what? Prove that you still think I'm hot. Hm. Wait. Are there camera's in here? Are we being watched? No. Wait, microphones? Can she hear us? I don't think so. Stop. I don't want her to hear us. Oh, who cares? I do. Let's be loud. Make her jealous. Cora? Cora. Are you okay, honey? Are you okay? What happened? We went for a walk. Don't tell your parents, okay? Okay. This will be our little secret. Cora looked good this morning. How'd it go last night. It was, well it can be some nebulism, or sleepwalking as you said, but unsure. There are many possibilities and they're difficult to determine. Okay. Jennifer, please be patient. It just takes time. I'll talk to Cora and try to make a connection. See you tonight. Can I come in? Yeah, sure. Which doll is this? Is this one? No. Is it me? Maybe. Wanted to see your drawings. Can I look? Do you want to be an artist? Maybe. Probably one day, your father will be selling your paintings. Maybe. Do you miss having your mom around? Kind of, but it's not a big deal. Oh, you have a Teddy bear. He protects you? It's a stuffed animal. True. But it has a meaning behind it. I have one and I believe he protects me. Maybe. I have a great idea. Follow me, come on. Oh, I'm not allowed to have soda. My mom doesn't let me. Let's break the rules for tonight, okay? Okay. And, we're gonna have a fancy dinner. Just the two of us. So we need some fancy glasses. Let's taste it. And. - Cheers. - Cheers. I need to show you something. Okay. Is it food? No. Then what is it? And now I play yours. What's going on here? Nothing. We're having a fancy dinner. Do you want to join us? Yeah, looks like fun. Is this soda? I love soda. I told you that was a good idea. I love these too, did you get these? Yeah, I bought them. We use them as feet. As your feet? - Bad dancing. - Hey. Where you going? I'm going to bed now. Well it was good to see her smile for a second. Yeah. Bloop. I think you can eat it now. I think I'd like some real wine. You? Why not? You ate like half of it. I just like strawberry. Yeah, I could tell. Want some more? Yes, please. So, how is your art dealing business going? It's fine, I'm just trying to figure out what to do with ruined paintings. Yeah, it's so bad. I guess there's not much to decide. Pretty well destroyed. Why are you laughing? To be honest, half of this work was trash anyways. Oh my god, cheers. Don't tell them I said that. What's going on? Where's Cora? She just went to bed. I'll go check on her. Goodnight. You gonna offer me a glass of whatever it is you're drinking? Uh, yeah. You bet. How was your day? Long. Why? Do you like her? Yeah. I mean not like that. I like what she's doing for Cora. She was great with her. You should have seen her tonight. Aw, is someone jealous. Stop. Come on, where is this coming from? Where is this coming from? I have a stranger living in my house with my husband and my daughter, having fancy dinners and drinking wine and doing god knows what else while I'm at work. Oh my gosh. Come on, that's ridiculous. You think this is funny? Yeah. Okay, yeah. While you're at work, I'm having an affair with the specialist. While our daughter sleep walks around the house, ruining my paintings. Don't mock me. Asshole. Hey, what, what are we doing? She just pulled a bunch of stuff out of the closet. - I don't. - Cora? Go get her, yeah. Cora? She's not here. She isn't there. Where is she? Nina. Nina, wake up! Where's Cora? Oh shoot. What time is it? Oh my god. Cora, hey! Cora. Oh my god! Oh my god. Get her. I can't get her. Watch her head, watch her head. Cora. Cora, breathe. Breathe into her mouth, breathe into her mouth. Oh my god, Cora. Please. Please, breathe. I think she's sleeping now. All right, I'll be back. How could you fall asleep? I'm sorry. She could have died. I know, I'm sorry. It will never happen again. Get out. Get the hell out of my house. I want her gone. - Okay. - Tonight. Get out. Hey, Cora can hear you, quiet. Hey. Hey, I need to go. I'm sorry. He will protect you. - Anton! - Sorry, we are closed. Ah, it's you. I need a drink. Can I offer you something special? Thirty years of whiskey, cures everything. Soft, fragrant. You'll like it! At the expense of the institution. Will you give me ice? This one is just clean. Bad day? Can I have more? I just want, I just, I'm just talking to you. Stop, stop. I'm just. I'm sorry if I hurt you. I, I didn't want to. Who are you? Did you draw this? That's none of your business. Who drew this? A young girl. Wait, I'm not gonna hurt you. Please, wait, wait. This girl is in danger. What are you talking about? If you care for her, you will hear me out. I'm a priest. Why should I believe you? I fought the enemy for years. The enemy? Evil. It's not just a coincidence that I happened to see these drawings. I've seen this picture before. This is not just a drawing. This is a demons face. One of the devil's disciples. The devil creeps up on us in many different ways. Through dark thoughts, visions, dreams, nightmares. Tell me about this young girl. You must help her. They're still not answering. Why do you keep plastic fish? What? Your fish. They're dead, soulless. Turn right, up ahead. - No. - Cora! No, what the hell? Cora. - Cora. - Help! It burns. - It burns. - You're okay, you're okay. - No, help, help. - We're right here. - You're okay, we got you. - Help. - Hey hey hey. - Calm down. Cora. Cora. Cora? Cora? Oh! Cora! You okay? Cora, what are you? Ah! I don't see her. Cora, Cora no! Stop it! Let go, Cora, let go. Oh my god. Leave me alone! - Come on, come on. - Put her down. Leave me alone. - Cora, we're here. - Help. Get her down, get her down. Help. Cora, it's mom and dad, Cora. Help, help, come on. Move, move. What do we do? Hold her down. I'm trying. Push. You. Drunk failure. Go back to London, throw yourself off a bridge. Maybe it'll work this time. Oh, look who's back. Why don't you go spend time with your real daughter. Oh, that's right, you can't, she's dead. Cora, please. And who's fault is that? Shut up, mom. You god damn liar. Cora, stop. Get your hands off me. You're not my real father. Who are you? Agrr. Is that your name? Yeah. Cora. Oh, Cora. Do you have a daughter? What? A daughter. Do you have a daughter? Yes, but she died a long time. How did she know that? She knows about me, too. What's happening to her? Is she gonna be okay? She has a fever, that's good. She's fighting. Take her to the bed to get some rest, and get a cold compress to cool her off. - Okay, I got her. - Go quick. - I got her. - Take her. Who is this guy. A priest. He knows what he's doing. Come on. Sit down, sit down. She'll be okay. How do you know him? I, We. This is Alexander. How do you know him? We. We don't have time for this, tell me. He. Is Derek Cora's father? Please don't tell Derek. It happened right before we met. I didn't want to tell him. I didn't want to lose him. She's all right. She's resting. What do we need to do? We do what's best for you daughter. I know the demon is inside her. I can get it out. The church has criteria that must be met for me to do this, but there is no time. I can help her. You must believe me. Courage the change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference, amen. How nice of you to stay with me. Do you want to see her? Take me to her. ♪ Na na ♪ ♪ Your fault ♪ ♪ It's all your fault ♪ ♪ It's all your fault ♪ ♪ It's all your fault ♪ ♪ Your fault, your fault ♪ ♪ It's all your fault ♪ ♪ It's all your fault ♪ Don't listen to the demon, he lies to you. Hey, open up. - Open the door! - Open the door. - Unlock the door. - Open the door. Open this door. It's not working. - Unlike the door. - I can't. Do you still have my cameras in her room? Do you still have my cameras in her room? Yeah, I think so. Right here. Oh, come on. Here we go. You noticed your presence here violates the church. They threw you out like trash. You lack in faith. You have no power here. Church law clearly points out that recitation in no way effects the order of power. I can give you true power. Just tell me what you want, I'll give it to you. I can give you everything. Come on, just say the words. You can get whatever you want. Oh, is it the body you want? Is it the girl? Well too bad, she's mine. Oh. My baby. I've been in this home for generations. And I will not leave her body until she bears me another and my home is rebuilt. I cast you out, unclean spirit, along with every satanic you have, every scepter from hell and your fallen companions in the name of our lord, Jesus Christ. And stay far away from this creature of god. Run from this place. Fermenter of discord. Author of pain and sorrow. Why then do you stand and resist knowing as you must that Christ the lord brings your plans to nothing. Burn, burn. Crucify his name, yet triumph over the powers of hell. Be gone then, in the name of the father, of the son, and the holy Trinity. Be blessed to the holy spirit by the sign of the holy cross of our lord, Jesus Christ. Lord. I command you, tell me your name, wicked one. Cora! Open the door! Open this door! Cora! Derek, help me! Help me open the door! Cora! Come on, open the door! Derek!

I got ya. I got ya. Father. So what do we? Are you okay? I'm fine, I'm fine. Stay back. It's okay. It's okay, I'm fine. He didn't burn completely. I must burn what was left of Alexander to destroy the demon. I know where he's buried. There isn't much time. So, what do we do now? Ashes to ashes. Come, I need your help. Oh my gosh. - Cora. - Hey. Hey. - Cora. - Cora. - Hey, can you hear me? - Cora. She's really hot. Can you hear me? Screw this, screw this. We're going to the hospital. - Come on. - Okay. - You got her? - Yup. - Here. - Thanks. You're okay baby, I got you, I got you. Okay, you're okay. I got you, I got you. I think the spirit was toying with me. What do you mean? When I touched Cora, she took me to somewhere else. I was in my flat and I could hear my daughter. Your daughter watches you from above. She's in a good place. I don't know, is she? That was my fault. I saw that cat scan and I knew that something was not right, but they told me she'll be okay. I never got to say goodbye. Don't listen to her. Take me back to Cora. What's happening? I'm fine. I'm just hot. Leave me alone. Why do you do this to me, andrey. Shut up. You can't live with me in side you. I can't live within you. You are not blood. Return me to the girl, or you and she will die. I won't let you kill her. That son of a bitch Alexander destroyed my body. It's only right that I should be able to stay in his daughter. If I burn the bones. She will slowly burn without me. Kill this bitch, kill her. We could be free. Let's go. Help, help us. Come on, come on. Come in. Come on, be careful. Cora, we're right here.
