VANITY Vert Bois Hotel, LTD Restaurant building Armatures - north, south, east faces Vert Bois Motel Sustainable development conference? They said there'd be a lot of people. But it's quiet. No, I'm not here for sustainable development. We put off closing another month for it. I'm sorry. Number 8. I'd like to settle now, if that's OK. Okay. If you're hungry, you can get snacks at Hollywood. Where? The Pentateuch One moment. - Where's Claire? - She broke two ribs. - Really? - Yes. Decorating the organization's Christmas tree. We tried to reach you, but your cellphone's out. Thanks. - Are you alone? - He'll meet us later. - Can I take your coat? - No it's fine. I'll wait. OK. What do you mean you'll wait? Well... we're going to go, aren't we? Claire was OK with... - "With"? - With doing it here. It's a hotel. We can't. OK. My wife was an architect. We did this motel together. That's why... OK. "After a final interview "during which you ask the member "if they are completely sure of voluntary termination, "in a quiet setting, "with their witness, "administer the member a tablet of Domperidone "20 minutes before the dose of Pentobarbital. "Once they're ready, "prepare and administer euthanasia "with the greatest respect and calm possible." Are you nervous? It's not easy. I promise not to file any complaints. Your customer service department must not be very busy. 100% customer satisfaction. We're an organization, not a company. And we say "members", rather than "customers". - Claire was nice. - Yes. I'm sorry. Especially for her. And we can't put it in a cast or anything. We just have to wait. Mr. Miller, is there nothing that could change your mind? Are you sure about this? I believe I was clear with Claire. It's procedure. I'll ask the question again a few times. You can stop at any time. I don't change my mind. - What is it? - Your hands are shaking. So... Did you get to eat beforehand? No, but it's fine. So you don't want to spend the holidays with your family? Credit card minimum, 20 CHF Why's the music so loud? No one's here! - It's to bring people in! - Ah! You wear those for every customer? Member. - Do you always wear them? - Yes. No. I do when I feel like it. So... Something simpler. - Croque-monsieur? - Croque-madame. But no egg. And no cheese. Hi. - Have we met? - No, I don't think so. You'll have to handle cheese. She put it in a machine... Required documents: Medical report Right. I can summarize for you. Born in '42. "July 8, 1942." - You're an architect. - Precisely. Married in '62, in Lausanne. A son, who's late; a wife, deceased; one cancer already. The rest is detail. Here. This is what was missing, right? Thanks. "The patient's medical situation "is incurable, with a low life expectancy." I know nothing about you. You want to know my age? That's not too polite. Three years younger than you. You look less. It takes work. - Portuguese? - No. Spanish. - But Esmeralda is... - No. Esperanza. Spanish. Been doing this long, Espe? Since I retired. I'll let you do the math. What's he doing? The one time I need him, he has to be late. - Don't be too tough on... - Cecil. - I thought it was a boy. - Cecil, no E. It's also for boys. Give me the anti-nausea pill. It'll make him come. When he gets here, I'll drink my glass and you can join your husband by midnight. What says I'm married? You don't choose earrings like that. Someone gives them to you. So, I'm saying... What do I know? In any case, tonight I'm here for you. You are married though. Yes. - Is he waiting? - I don't fret. A fine answer, Espe. You're terrific. And you're sure ironical. Not at all. I'm quite sincere. Go on, tell me about this husband. What do you want me to say? I don't know. What your home is like. What's it like when you come home after... After this. My husband's not for all this. I mean support, Elexio. So when I get home, we act as if nothing happened. - He doesn't want to know. - Really? But tonight, for instance, he knows where you are? Of course. I always leave an address. What's his profession? Fernando did construction. In Spain he did everything. But here, he did concrete his whole life. Then he retired. The kids left home, but we didn't budge. I think you have the wrong room. This is 8. It's next door. - How naïve you are. - I believe in people, that's all. A Slav alone in a motel room is a Russian whore, to you. Great mentality! And the guy before, just a passing friend? I don't know. You smoke? So you're shocked, huh? I think we ought to cut them some slack. You here for the conference? No. We live in Lausanne. Ah... A change of rhythm. - We aren't married. - I got that. - What's that? - Do as you like. See that? He took me for a prostitute. No, come on. Why not? It's for you. - Come. - No, I'm not moving. - I won't come in. - We'll talk in the car. I know you asked me. We haven't seen you for years. I never thought he'd do this. But he never told you he agreed. You don't refuse something like this. How long has it been, Mr. Miller? The little shit stopped talking when he was 18. He wasn't at his mom's funeral? Just as we weren't at his wedding... What did you do to the boy? Nothing. Well... No, nothing. I never liked him. That's all. From the start, I couldn't feel him. He was so red and ugly. You don't know what an 18-month scream is like. I had three boys. You have a maternal instinct. Not Françoise. Not at all, unfortunately. And me neither. Françoise could have had an abortion, even back then, but we let it live. It's a bit pompous to be mad, since neither of you wanted him. Not true. We tried. It was a time of experiencing. So having a child, why not? We gave it a shot, and figured it'd come little by little. When Cecil was 2, Françoise was hired to teach architecture in the US. We left the kid with friends who couldn't have children. Cecil stopped wailing the second he got there. My wife and I lived in Boston for 5 years. Fabulous years. When we came back we could have taken him, but he was so happy there. Did you ever miss him? No. No... - You find that selfish. - Sorry? As if raising kids isn't selfish. Offing yourself is also selfish. You can't do that! I give the pills. In order. And I'm not giving you anything. I can't. It's strictly forbidden without a witness, and you know that. Hello again. Can I talk to you for a second, please? I don't do couples anymore. No, no! Wait! It's not that. It's hard to discuss here. Can I get you a drink, in Hollywood? In the bar, the Hollywood. It's an old English car. Reliant Scimitar GTE. 1972. - You like cars? - No. Too much trouble. I just care about design. It's stupid to have built the office here and the rooms there. It's the era, the '60s. It's the American style. The Americans are listening to me. Don't criticize everything. I think it's an interesting architectural idea. - Totally stupid. - Stupid, but interesting. I don't get it. I have terminal cancer! As they say, kaput! - I'm sorry. - It's not your fault. - I'd like for you to help me. - Yes. No! No. No. Why don't you do it manually? Under a train, or off a balcony. Suicide? Oh no! Elexio is euthanasia. - Ah! - It's not really the same. OK. I'm not a very brave guy. That's why I need your help. Why don't you let things happen? If you're very sick, God doesn't need your help in his work. God and I don't talk anymore, you see. I don't want to die in the street or a hospital, with strangers. Or worse: idiots! I don't want a natural death. I don't think death is natural. For David, hoping he understands Why don't you go to the hospital? They have specialists. I've gone enough. I know the specialists. Espe? Espe, if you're hiding, we see you. Meet Constantin Gabril... - What? - Gabrilovic. Gabrilovic Treplyov, my new witness. I see you're not too hot, but what's the protocol? Are you of age? - ID? - I need ID? - You're leaving? - No. I was waiting for you. - You understand, Treplyov? - Just about. And you're not scared? - It doesn't hurt. - No. But you need an iron stomach. Why "iron"? It isn't guaranteed painless? It's not easy to watch someone die, Mr. Miller. Ah! I've seen that, at school. Sergei. He was my football buddy. He was squashed by a milk truck. There were bits of Sergei everywhere. No milk for a week. How long for Mr. ...? Miller. 15 minutes or 20 hours. - "20 hours"? - "20 hours"! No. Theoretically. The maximum. - It never happens? - Never. - What's your longest? - A few hours. That's no good. I have a client toward 10. It's a regular, sorry. And you'll be... I mean... - How long? - Yes. Him, no problem. He's gentle as a sheep. - Meaning? - We talk, manual labor... Okay, okay... Not long. He's an ER doc. And I know what I'm doing. - And then? - For now that's all. I thought I'd be busier, with the conference, but they take the train here and sleep down town. Or they don't like sex. So let's say 10:30? 10:30? There's no one client, big, small rich, jobless... It's democratic. Sometimes they come mainly to talk. Or they don't want to talk at all. Some men come to vent. Hazards of the trade, like working on highways or in schools where the kids are armed. - And so? - I don't know. I can't hear. And so? This isn't a film, Espe. This only works in the movies. - What? What? - Shhh... I hear a sound. He couldn't come. So I showered. That OK? "He couldn't come"? He broke down? No. Come. That's why. - Do you have another job? - No. I studied design, and did this to help my family. - It's better. - You can't compare. Especially the degree. I work when I need money, for plane tickets or other stuff. Has it been long? And you? Tell me, I was wondering... How's it work, with two men? - You're interested. - No, no! It's just... Just to know. I... He's very curious. Will you keep doing it? Yes. Why? It's a bit sad, isn't it? Like dying in a motel room. Well. - Oh, sorry. - Thanks. How much, per hour? Depends on what you want. - The works. - 300 francs, about. I've 50 francs. 250. Will that do? This can't involve money. I didn't hear it. - You're not payed? - It's her hobby. Let's go. You need another Domperidone. Is he... Is he dead? No. It's to keep him from vomiting. That way when he takes the product 20 minutes later, it doesn't come up. Well, answer it. Sorry. Yes? No, still here. Why? Wait. It's my client. - Now he thinks he can... - Now? It's desire. It can't be controlled. - What do I say? - For 300 francs, say yes. Okay. But right away. I have others after. Electronic cigarette. For health reasons. No smell, no cancer. Old school smoking. - Old school lung cancer. - No thanks. I have a wife and kids. - You have kids? - A wife? Well, yeah. - Want to see? - Yes. Not that. Not that. Excuse me, it's my work phone. There. Helena, and behind, Dimitri. And little Erik. You're not...? Single? Not at all. iMaricón! You're not gay? I mostly sleep with men. You're homosexual by trade. We're all a bit bisexual, no? - You should try. - It's a bit late. I was educated by nuns. The whole way. SOS Doctors - I'm ready. - Ah, sorry... See you later. - Is this cupcake yours? - Don't knock my car. Looks like a hand vacuum. Is it on? What's the point of a motor if it's silent? You hear the music better. Wait. It's Nougaro. Don't know it. From Toulouse. Some's in Spanish. To Lausanne ears, maybe. But in Sevilla, this is like German. Really, I led almost a parallel life to your husband's. I designed buildings, he laid concrete... We lived the better part of the century. I don't know if you can compare pouring concrete and designing buildings. No, but I'm not complaining. I was very happy. And I still can be. Do you want... - It's the handle. Pull. - I know... I'll help. Sorry! That way he swings in French, makes me want to cry. Cry. It'll do you good. Since chemo, I've really tried... but not one tear. Let me help you. It's actually you slipping the noose around my neck. It's easier to do on oneself. Mind if I make a Windsor knot? No. Not at all, no. So? What? Your ER doc? Very good this time. Thanks. He's gentle as a sheep. We say "gentle as a lamb," not a sheep. Very well. Thanks. There. You're handsome as a lark. That's good, there. Pull. Very good. What happens after? I mean, when Mr. Miller... When I no longer feel Mr. Miller's pulse, I'll record the time of death and call the police so they can note... - "The police"? That's bad. - You don't have papers? - Yes, but not my own. It'll be fine. They're used to it. Mr. Miller, I'll ask for the last time: would you like to turn back? No. One moment. David... Can I hug you? This has taken long enough. Let's go... Once you drink it, you can't go back. Understand? Thanks, Esperanza. Don't do it, Mr. Miller. You mustn't give up. I beg of you. Please. If I listened to people like you, I'd be in a hospital bed, awaiting my 4th operation. Excuse me, but... But shit. You should be where? Nowhere. Wait. I thought that in your state operations can't do anything. What's the difference? Do you have cancer? Yes or no? - Yes. What do you think? - I don't get it. He has a chance of making it. For me, that changes everything. I signed a contract with your group. - Keep your promises. - It's false. I have connections. Have you realized the consequences? You live by abusing others. I've always done as I wanted. Now... for my death, I demand it be the same! - Demand? - And I assume the consequences. What an ass you are, Miller. You want to live in denial of others. You want to control everything. Very well. I'm out of here. You want to teach me a lesson? Vengeance of the working class? No! We should have put exposed beams. What an idiot! What an idiot I am... Broken down? The batteries go in the cold. It's electric. It doesn't break down. Going, Treplyov? You killed my desire to work. I'm sorry. What's that mean? Between "trash heap" and "enemy of humanity". Accept my apologies. Please. Oh! Sorry. What's "denial"? "Denial of others"? Deliberately not seeing something. - How's it used? - When bawling, or at the shrink. Ah, OK. See? You gave me a word, and got one in return. Nothing's free. It's true, this lot is ugly. What a thought, in front of the windows. I'm not saying anything. Imagine how it was here in the '60s. My wife and I were young architects. We took aspects from along Route 66, in the US, and reinterpreted them. The roof bearing column there, we saw that in a drive-in in Hext, Oklahoma. Closing permanently, December 13, 2014 December 10, 2014 If you'd seen that, Treplyov. Behind each room, the pool, tennis courts... - A pool? - Yes. It had to be filled in in 1987. It wasn't poorly designed, but regulations changed. You're dripping. I'll bandage you up. You're going to lose it all. For David, hoping he understands. Listen, Treplyov. "I was there when you came by the organization... "I only do filing and cleaning there. "I'm not allowed to accompany. "You had the mark. The same as Fernando, my husband." Information sheet "You were born the same year and day as Fernando. "I don't believe in chance, Monsieur Miller. "You didn't see me, but I heard you. "Your file was incomplete. "You lacked a medical statement. "I was alone at the office when you called back." Vert Bois Motel, 301 R de Berne, North Lausanne. Room 8. "I don't believe in chance, Mr. Miller. "I thought I had to help you, "where I wasn't brave enough for my husband." Come, Constantin. No, no. Climb atop me. Really? All right? Tell my son... that his father is truly sorry. Sorry for what? Just tell him I'm sorry. OK. Your son... where does he live? Ah shit! Uh... Rue... It's two something. Two hills? Two churches? Two...? - Two bridges, "ponts"? - That's it. I have a client on Rue des 2 ponts. He lives exactly between the two bridges... OK. Come on, that's enough. Come on, Treplyov. "Come on", what? Smother me with this pillow. - I can't do that. - Quit your la-di-da... I won't move. Count to 100, and it'll be over. Go on. I don't want to kill. It's not "kill", it's a favor. Look. I'll be good as gold. Come on. Come on, Treplyov. Come on. Come on, Treplyov. Come on! Come on, smother! Come on! Treplyov... Hello? Hello? Mr. David Miller is expected at reception. The architect Miller is expected at the pool office. I'm not here, Mr. Miller, right away! The regulations changed. The pool was fine. To reception, now! I say, it wasn't me! The regulations changed! What did I do? There's a problem with the pool. Sorry. Explain yourself regarding code. Excuse me! What did you do? I never accompanied anyone. I just do filing and cleaning for the organization. But with you, it was different. Fernando, my husband, begged me to help him die every day. Even when he could no longer speak, I saw it in his eyes. One day, he handed me a plastic bag, and he wanted me to... to wrap it around his head. Me, the mother of his children. I couldn't. In 50 years, we were only apart for 2 days. He was my world. A priest say that sickness is a gift from god, that it leads straight to heaven, and his suffering was a chance to expiate a life of sin. But Fernando was a good man. A good father. A good husband. He had nothing to expiate! That was all bullshit. So, Miller... David, do what you have to do. No one will judge you. Wait, it's almost midnight. A little effort and you'll see a new day. I came back for you, not for my husband. The Ambassadors, by Holbein the Young. Room 5 has The Lone Wolf. In 17, A Monet, The Gare Saint-Lazare. And my room has a copy of an Albert Anker, The Strawberry Girl. She looks like mother. - Fortunately they're closing. - What will you do? I found a motel on the outskirts, by the convention center. What's that? Ah, that! Come. Down. On your knees. See the skull? No. - More to the side. - But... Trust me. Bend like this. Yep. Ah, there! It's a vanitas. - It isn't a skull? - It is. - It's also called a "vanitas." - Ah, OK. It took me months to spot it. What were you doing on all fours? - Where's your gadget? - Out of batteries. - No comment. - But you're thinking it. It's gone. Glioblastoma? Multiple oligodendroglioma. I'm very proud. - Metastasized? - Very locally. On the parietal lobe. If the doctors mess up and I end up a vegetable, will you tell them to unhook me? I'll strangle you with my own hands. Promised. And I'll help. Yes. As a family. Thanks. Wait. Now. Two-Bridges Path Rue des Deux-Ponts. What? What are we doing here? Talking to your son, Mr. Miller. I'd rather go to the hospital. I'll do whatever you want after you talk to him. Treplyov's right. Get out or I'll honk and wake everyone. One after the other. Yes, oh... Go on. Who are you? A big perv who watches kids at night? I'm Santa's travelling salesman. I'm here to check if you have a chimney. - There's a chimney? - No. That's just it. No. - I wonder how he'll get in. - Santa doesn't exist. Yeah? So... In fact, you're sleeping. I'm just a dream. And if I shoot you, will you die? And what do you do when I'm not dreaming you? Now it's time for bed. A new dream awaits you. Will I see you again? In dreams or for real? For real. It's up to you. I don't know... Yes. Did you cry? Don't joke. It's cold, I'm tired... What did he say? Nothing. Father-son things. That's all. Ancient mists that drive across the surface of this lake, bind you our eyes with sleep and show us in our dreams that which will be in twice ten thousand years! VANITY Subtitles: Eclair Media
