Nayla! -This is for you. -Thank you, Uncle Reno. You're welcome, Sweety. -Take care of your mom. -Okay. Happy birthday. I didn't forget your birthday. But I haven't bought anything for you.

But before sleeping, what if we play the shadow game first? -Let's do it. -Come on. Hi. My name is Toni. My name is Tania. Hi, Tania. May I kiss you? May I? -You may. -I may? Come here and I will kiss you. -Kiss! -Kiss! And may I... Are you sure you want to resign from your job? I really can't work here anymore because I have to take care of Nayla. I think you can take leave. You don't need to resign. And when you're ready to go back to work, just call me. Okay? Have you talked to Reno? -I don't think that's necessary. -I will call him. Thank you. Now it's my turn. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten! Nayla. -Nayla. -Yes, Mom? -Who are you playing with? -I'm playing with Nyai. -Nyai who? -My friend, Mom. But I don't see anyone else here. Nyai is my friend, period! Nayla. Nayla. All right. I'm sorry, okay? Nayla. Forgive me, okay? Please open the door, Kid. I'm coming in now, okay? Why is your room so messy? I'm sorry, Mom. All right then. Come here. I apologize. Right, I cook your favourite meal. -Are you hungry? -Yes. -Let's go eat then. -Let's go. I want to ask you something. With whom did you play earlier? Nayla, I'm asking you a question. Mom, I told you. I played with Nyai. Hello, Aunty. -Ros. -Aunty. -Thanks for coming to keep me company. -It's okay. -Please come in. -Where's Nayla? She's sleeping in her room. How's Nayla? Nayla now... has an imaginary friend. What do you mean by imaginary friend? She... likes to play alone and talk to herself. And she keeps mentioning the name "Nyai". Nyai? There's something I want to talk to you about. Do you know what is it? What is this? I have never seen it before. I found it when grandma passed away. Okay. It's late already. Get some rest in the bedroom. What happened, Mom? I guess I'm too tired. I just had a dream. You go back to sleep. ♪Lullaby♪ ♪Oh, lullaby♪ ♪If you are not sleeping♪ ♪The mosquito will bite you♪ ♪Lullaby♪ ♪Oh, lullaby♪ ♪If you are not sleeping♪ ♪The mosquito will bite you♪ ♪Lullaby♪ ♪Oh, lullaby♪ ♪If you are not sleeping♪ ♪The mosquito will bite you♪ Nayla, wake up, Sweety. Hurry up. What's going on, Mom? Ros! Ros. Nayla. It's better if you and Nayla stay at my house. I have a maid who can help babysit her. And there's plenty of toys too. Nayla can do whatever she wants. Nayla wouldn't want to move from here. Because she said she had an imaginary friend now. -What do you mean? -Actually I'm scared to live here too. -But... -Okay then. You and Nayla stay at my house for now. Listen to me, Ros. I will stay here to keep you company. I can babysit Nayla too. So you can work again. (Cinema Five) -You guys are still here? -Hi, Nes. Yes. -I'm leaving now. Bye. -Be careful. Ros, I'm glad that you're back to work again. -But who watches over Nayla? -She's with my aunty at home. That's good. Things are settled now. Before going home, what if we eat first? But you pay. -It's your idea but I have to pay? -Once a while. -You go first. I'll meet you outside. -Hurry up. -I'm hungry. -Okay. ♪Lullaby♪ ♪Oh, lullaby♪ -Rosma? -My hand is blee.. -What's wrong with your hand? -My hand was bleeding. The blood... Nothing's there. What's the matter, Ros? I'm not lying. There was a ghost there. And that ghost looks exactly the same with the one I saw at my house. I even fell and hurt my hand. Where? Your hand is not bleeding. Ros, I bet you are tired and you have a lot on your mind. Listen. We can take a rain check for dinner. So you can go home and rest. Okay? Since I'm starving now, you don't mind if I go first, do you? Okay. -You scared me! -You haven't gone home, Rosma? I'm going now. Bye. Okay. Be careful. What's wrong, Ros? Aunty, that doll is supposed to be in Nayla's room. But it's in my closet now. -Maybe it was a dream. -No, it's not. -All right. I will sleep with you here. -What about Nayla? I will carry Nayla here. Wait. Nayla? Nayla? Nayla. Nayla! Nayla! Nayla.

Nayla, you're a smart kid, are you? Come on and get off the car. You said you wanted to make me proud. Come on, get off, Sweety. But I don't live here. Is it okay? If you need anything, I will introduce you to the maid. -Peace be upon you. -Yes. One second. Nayla, Rosma, this is Mbok. If you need anything, just tell her. -Please take this. -Yes. -Come on. -Thank you. Get in. -Peace be upon you. -And upon you too. It's good, isn't it? We have swimming pool, garden over there. Nayla, come here. Quick. Just like the kids nowadays. Hi, guys. Look who's here at Uncle Reno's house. Smile. This is Nayla's first day in Uncle Reno's house. Guys, I think Nayla is not too excited. To make you excited, come with me. One moment. Is it nice? What a beautiful room. You like it, don't you? Isn't it nice? I want to show you one more thing. A toy room. Come here. Here it is. Nayla's toy room. Aren't they great? Sit down. Let me show you. We have a tent, a toy horse. A pony, giraffe. We have Barbie, teddy bear, violin. And this. I am Princess Aurora. Hello, Nayla. Why don't you smile? Hello. I'm Princess Aurora. Hello. Hello? Hello? Nayla? Hold this. Nayla, you know it, right? I love you so much. I know you feel lonely because I'm busy with work. But I work hard for you. I really want to be able to buy you anything you want. Because I love you. You are my world. My weariness and sorrow are gone when I see you healthy and happy. So don't make me sad, okay? I can lose anything for you. You are the only one I have. Hi, Nayla. Are you sleepy yet? I don't think so. Don't lie. If you lie, I will pinch you. -Seriously. Are you sleepy or not? -I'm not. I think you lie to me. I'll kiss you then. -Do you like playing the shadow game? -I like it. Thank you for agreeing to live in Uncle Reno's house. Okay, it's late now. -Time for you to sleep. -Okay. You have to wake up early tomorrow. -Okay. Sleep now. -Yes. Bye. You still haven't finished your meal? Here, let me feed you. I saw you looked so happy sitting on the swing last night. Of course. Because I played with my friend. -Who is your friend? -Nyai. Don't tell my mom that I played with Nyai. Or Nyai will be mad. I'm done. Nyai? -What's the matter? -In the toilet, just now, someone tried to strangle me. Nothing's there. -Don't hallucinate. I'm here. -No, I'm not. I'm sure it will follow me home. There's no way it will follow you home. We're going home now. What is it, Mbok? I saw Nayla played on the swing alone last night. She laughed alone. And when I asked her whom did she play with, Nayla said... that it was Nyai. -Where's Nayla now? -In the toy room. Let me talk to Nayla. Nayla. Is Nyai here? Come here, Sweety. Don't think about it too much. You need a rest too. Nayla. Wake up, Sweety. It's morning already. Nayla, wake up! Who drew this, Nayla? I did. So this is the ghost that you keep seeing? I think it's also the one who killed Aunty Dahlia. (Recorded) (Recorded) Nothing. Just stay calm. I need to get ready now. I have a meeting. Okay? Your grandma... What about my grandma? Your grandma had a contract. What contract? Rosma. Sir? Sir? What's the matter with you? That old man... From the first time I came here, he's been watching me. Old man? Who? Mbok! Mbok! Come here. What is it? Is there any old man around this house? No. No old man. Thank you, Mbok. Okay. Stop this nonsense. Reno, I think we have to go to my grandma's house. I saw my grandma went into this room a few times. She brought egg and some incense. She went into that room? Rosma. Grandma? Where am I, Grandma? You have to carry out the contract. Rosma. Rosma! What contract, Grandma? My contract with Nyai. When I die, my children and grandchildren will carry out that contract. Rosma! Rosma! Rosma! Rosma! Rosma! Rosma! Rosma! Rosma! Rosma! Rosma! Reno, this is the Kyai that can help you and Rosma. But I'm sorry, I still have work to do. So, good luck. -Thank you. -Sir. Good luck, Bro. Go ahead, Sir. That way, Kyai. I know. In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Rosma! -Wait! -Rosma! -Kyai... Rosma! -Wait! Rosma! Rosma! She has to carry out the contract. Do not disturb her! Get out! Do not interfere! Get out! She has to carry out the contract! Rosma! In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Rosma! Rosma. Rosma. Praise be to God. Praise be to God. Nayla. I want to ask you something. Do you still see Nyai often? Nayla, answer me. Do you still see Nyai often? Rosma. Rosma! Nayla. Get out of there, Sweety. Get out of there. Rosma. Nayla. Nayla. Rosma. This is Rosma. Rosma, this is Abah. Here. Sorry. There's a missing part over here. Where is it? I don't know. That is all we got. "Whoever you are, you will have to carry out the contract with Nyai." "And whoever tries to intervene, Nyai will kill them." What contract is that, Abah? It's not explained here. If the paper was still intact, then we would be able to know about the contract. Pardon me, Miss. I'm just a Sundanese translator. Thank you for your time. You have to leave me, Reno. No matter what happens... I will never leave you or stay away from you. You hear me? Whoever intervenes, Nyai will kill them. And I don't want anything bad to happen to you. Hello. Okay. I'm on my way. Yes. I have to go to work. I will take you home now and we will meet at the cafe. Nayla. Please do me a favor. You have to help me. It's important for both of us. I need to know what contract that Grandma Naroh made with Nyai. Answer me, Nayla. Hello. How's Nayla? She still doesn't want to talk. -I'll be on my way in a minute. -Okay. I'm going to work now. You stay home with Sri. Hi. Thank you. I think we've met before? My name is Dewi. I'm Lina. Oh right. I have a name card. Here. I'm sorry. Thank you. Hello. (Cinema Four) I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Are you tired? -No. -I will order some coffee for you. -I'm fine. -It's okay. I'll get the coffee. -I want one coffee. -Okay. One minute. Thank you. Reno. The old man I saw yesterday at your house, he starred at me again. When I tried to chase him in the alley, he disappeared. I'm worried now. All right. Listen. I will spend a night tonight. I will be standing guard. Reno? Reno? Open the door, Reno. Reno. The door. Nayla. Nayla. Nayla, wake up, Sweety. You have to help me. Nyai is trying to kill Uncle Reno. Only you can help him. You will help him, won't you? Come on. Nyai! Please let him go, Nyai! Uncle Reno is very kind to me. I beg you. Let him go. Nyai! Nyai! Please! Reno. I will resign from my job. I will focus on taking care of Nayla and you. I will get my stuff in my locker today. Sir? Sir? Who are you actually? Her descendant has to become the servant of Nyai. To replace Naroh, your grandmother. That's the contract. Surrender your life to Nyai. If you refuse it, the people that you love will have to pay the consequence. This is a timeless contract. The contract between human and Satan. Her death will bring forth a new servant. I don't want to serve the demon. All of the descendants... of the people who have served Nyai... will carry out this contract. Thank you, Nyai. You have given me knowledge. I will devote my life to you. I will give my descendant to you when I die. If not, all of the descendants of your grandma will die. I don't want to do that! I'm sorry, Miss. But I only translate the Sundanese language... written on this paper. -Please forgive me. -Rosma. I know everything now. Nyai wants me to be the successor of my grandma. I'm sorry, Reno. I'm the one who makes your life miserable. Don't say that. Okay? Everything will be all right. Rosma. What if our prediction is wrong? What do you mean? That contract. The curse. Nyai wants a new servant, the descendant of Grandma Naroh. And Grandma Naroh's descendant... is not only you. Nayla! Nayla! Mbok! Where's Nayla? Nayla is not here. I found it in her room. Reno, this is my family's gravesite. Let's go! Nayla! Nayla! -Nayla! -Nayla! -Nayla! -Nayla! Nayla. Nayla! -Nayla! -Nayla! Rosma! Rosma! Nayla. -Nayla! -Nayla! Nayla! Nayla! Open the door! Nayla! Nayla! Nayla! Open the door! Nayla, please open the door. Nayla. Nayla! Nayla, open the door! Nayla! Nayla! Rosma! Reno! Reno. Reno! Reno. Nayla! Nayla! (Reno Isvandiar bin Zoeibir Mahmoed)
