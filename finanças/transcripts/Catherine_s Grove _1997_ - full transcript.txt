[dramatic music] [shower running] [uptempo Latin guitar music] - [Ernesto] Believe me Jack, this is a damn good deal. - Well, the only way to know is to taste 'em. Mmm... Ooh, that's good. - Havanas. Churchill. - Mmm, taste real good. - Joya del Mundo. - Joya del Mundo. - How do we know those are the real thing? - Oh, come on. Take a look, you see this Y over here? - Yeah? - Almost looks like a P? That's deliberate bad printing. Those Cubans, they think they're very smart. Now if the Y would be open, that's Dominican knockoff. Not even worth 99 cents. - I don't know about this. - Hey, you gotta trust me, guys. You know why? Because I know about cigars, and you don't. - See? I trust you, Ernesto. - [Ernesto] Good. - We'll take 'em. - How many? - All of 'em. Load 'em up. We gotta make some money. - You got a deal, man. [Jack laughing] See you later, buddy. Hey. - What? - Are you in on this? - Am I in on this? What do you mean am I in on this? Do I have a choice? You just gave him all our money. - Hey, relax. - How much are we gonna sell 'em for? - 70 bucks a piece, five cigar minimum. - Five cigar minimum? - Five cigar minimum. - A five cigar minimum? - Yeah, man. We got a hot item here. These will all be gone by the weekend. - I hope so. Don't give me that smile. Shit. [sniffing loudly] - Aren't you a little old to be doing drugs in the bathroom? [sniffing] - What egg did you break out of? Better go look for your mother duck. - And that would mean? [scoffing] [frenetic electronic dance music] - Hey! [Sally laughing] Do you have to go away this weekend? We could have so much fun. [knocking] - Hey, Jack, come on in. - Jack, what you got for me? - 30 Havanas. The best money can buy. - Great. Stay and have a drink. - No, no, no, I gotta get going. - Never knew you to refuse free booze, Jack. - Well, I have a girlfriend now. - So what? - Family is prison. Maximum, minimum, and work camp. Believe me, I've been to 'em all. - [Man] Hey, watch it! - Family is everything. As long as they can accept. - This is a private conversation, Carl. Carl. - I'm not Carl. I'm Carlina. The most beautiful girl in the world. - Yes, well could you go be beautiful someplace else? - I have to go. - What's the matter, Catherine? What the... [Sally sighing] - What? She can't talk to me? - Put it on my tab. - Russian ice cream, double scoop. - [Bartender] You got it. - What's this? - Hmm? - 30 times 70 is 2,100, not 1,900. Dave, you owe me 200. [Dave scoffing] - Jack, he's the mayor. - What, I don't give a shit if he's the pope. - You gotta give him a break, for Christ's sake. - They're buying 'em for 70, they're selling 'em for 90. It's a hell of a deal. You owe me $200, Dave. [Dave sighing] Come on. - He is not gonna be happy about this, Jack. - Good luck. [siren wailing] - Well, if it isn't Jack Doyle and Nick Pirelli. I thought you boys were on pawn patrol. - [Nick] Oh, man. - Hey, I know this guy. Vinnie Costello, he was a waiter at the Club Monaco. - What'd she do nights? - [Jack] Danced his ass off at the Club Ignition. - Cigarette found nearby. Herbal. - Any witnesses? - Yeah. Neighbor said he passed him last night on the catwalk. - See anything unusual? - No, but in his description, he said our girl had on a tiara. - He ain't wearing no tiara now. - I doubt robbery was the motive. - That makes three dead queens in two months. - Same weapon? - Medical examiner says looks like one of them little hammers again. I'd like it better if they'd just beat these freaks up. - If I hear a comment like that again, I'm gonna write you up. - What is your problem, Pirelli? - These guys pay your salary. Why don't you have some respect for the dead, you asshole? - Asshole, callin' me an asshole? - Hey, hey, man, take it easy! Hey! - He called me an asshole. - It was just a joke. Chill out, man. Come here. [siren wailing] - There's a pair for you. Bleeding heart liberal and a con man. Jerks! - Hey, Marla. - Hey, boys. - [Jack] Five bucks says he's got a bug up his ass about my boat. - All we have is a cigarette. No footprints, no fingerprints. - Nope. - How about the tiara? - Oh, you heard about that? - Nobody pawns costume jewelry. - Do we have anything else? - No, sir. - Then it's back on pawn shops. Find that tiara. The basis of good police work is detail. By the book detail. Doyle, I want a word with you in my office. - Yes, sir. - Where'd you get the money for the boat? - Side gigs. - How much was it? - 40 grand. - 40 grand for that piece of shit? - That's an antique, sir. Besides, I'm only in for half. I'm splittin' it with Charley. - Do you know what Internal Affairs could make of this? - I do my job and I work hard. - Well, right now, that's pawn detail. - Yes, sir. - And know that I'm watching you. - [Thomas] It seems to me that you're saying you're gonna ignore this. - That's exactly what I'm saying. Look, I'd like to help, but I'm afraid there's nothing the police can do. - [Thomas] Yeah, but I want to find my sister. - Your sister's 29, you haven't spoken to her since Sunday, and there's no sign of disturbance in her apartment. Unless there's signs of foul play, there's nothing we can do until she's been gone for a week. - What do we pay you for again? - Legally, your sister's not missing. I've taken down the information, but I can't activate a report until the end of the week. Look, 99% of all missing women in South Florida turn up in a couple of days, with a tan, a smile and a return ticket from the Bahamas. Stay by the phone, just wait a couple of days. - You don't know my sister, this isn't like her. I'm afraid something might have happened, or something may happen. I can't just wait around. - I could recommend a private investigator, but it'll cost ya. - Money's not an issue. - Look, call him. Maybe he can do something to help find your sister. - Thanks. - [Jack] Hey, did I just get the next payment on my boat? - Come on, we gotta hit these pawn shops. - You owe me five bucks. I was right about Ridges. He had a bug up his ass about my boat, but you can keep it as a referral fee. - [Nick] You know, I don't know why everyone says you're such a cheap bastard. - Hey, my baby. Working hard on the boat, hmm? So... What have we got here? [Charley chuckling] I hope it's not another divorce case. I swear, I'd prefer to swim in a sewer than to deal with those women. - Missing sister. - Missing person? - Mmhmm. $3,000 up front. - Interesting. - And $3,000 when we find her. - Hmm, very interesting. - Hmm, yeah. [Charley chuckling] We'll meet the guy tonight. - Okay. - That gives us a couple of hours. What do you say we, um, fool around a little bit? A little celebration. - Hmm [chuckles] are you, like, trying to take advantage of me? - Yes. - You bad boy. [sultry Latin guitar music] You know, you're not really attractive to me. - No? - Uh-uh. - Well, I love a good challenge. - You do, huh? Okay. I-I will pretend that... That I'm enjoying this. [gasping] Oh, Jack... [dramatic music] [crow cawing] [Blue whining] - Catherine! Get back down here, right now! [rock music] - You know they're dealin' drugs out of this joint? - I like it here. - Okay, you're the boss. When was the last time you saw Catherine? - Uh, last weekend in Winter Haven. My family owns a small estate up there. Not much, an old house and some orange groves. My uncle maintains the property up there and we visit him from time to time. Uh, Catherine returned Sunday morning, uh, I think she had to be back for a hair and make-up job at a wedding. - She never made it to work? Does she have any friends she might be staying with? - She kept pretty much to herself. This isn't like her. - Okay. How about a photograph, you got a photograph of her? - Yeah, in her apartment. Uh, here are the keys and her address. I also wrote down her work address. Do you ever say anything, or are you just here to look pretty? - Where's the down payment? $3,000. Uh, maybe that's a little out of your league, eh? Thank you. - Baby, I love ya. [uptempo Latin guitar music] [gasping] - Oh, Jack, I love that song! Baby, let's dance, come on. You know, when I was little, they used to play that on the radio all the time. Come on, let's dance. - No. - Yes. - Baby, I'm not gonna dance. - Come on. - What? - Well, Jack only likes to dance in funerals and weddings, so, dance with me? Besides, it will take your-your mind off things. [Charley chuckling] Sorry, I don't mean to lead. - Oh no, it's all right, I have no idea what I'm doing. - That's not true, you are doing quite well, you know? - Yeah? - Yeah. I mean, guys don't really know how to dance. Take Jack for instance. I mean, I give him, give him a six pack, rock and roll, oh. Oh, and some hokey pokey, you know? He goes crazy with that. [laughs] Yeah. But you know, play something like this... He just doesn't get it. [Charley chuckling] [Charley shouting in foreign language] They smell like shit, they look like shit, and I don't know why you have to smoke those shitty things! - I smoke them because they cost 40 bucks a piece. - Yeah, well, oh! Jack! - What? - "What?" I mean, gah, oh, [scoffs] great, I mean, a fair price to pay to puke, you know? I mean, 40 bucks. [Jack gagging] Oh jeez, leave me alone, Jack. - Oh come on, come on, hey, let's go sit and relax. - No, I do not, I do not eat those things, they're fried, you know? So, I don't like it. What? Oh, sometimes I can't stand you. - [Jack] Oh. - I just don't know what... [Jack humming] What are you doing, Jack? - I'm doing the box trot with Thomas, 'cause Jack won't dance with me. He only dances at funerals and weddings. - Would you just please leave Thomas out of this, huh? And look at yourself. I mean, look-look-look around. You've been here what, almost a year, right? And-and-and you're still in boxes. What are you gonna do, Jack? Are you gonna stay, or are you gonna move out? - Now wait a second. - No, wait a second, no! Oh, just stop eating those fucking things! And you look like a pig! - Listen, I just sold the rowing machine. Nick gave me three cigars for it. If that isn't the beginning of a commitment, I don't know what is. - No, okay? I want you to think before you talk. I don't want you to say anything you're gonna regret afterwards. Oh! [objects clattering] Jack! What is wrong with you? You pig. Enjoy your fucking cigars. - Open up, Cath! [Sally sobbing] Cath! [hissing] Cath! [Sally meowing] - Sally! It's 1:00 a.m.! - Who the fuck cares? - I am the manager, man. - If you're the manager, why don't you go get a key? - Shh! - Shh! Shh! Shh... - Don't, shh! [Sally stomping loudly] Let is go, Sally! - [Sally] Open the fuck up! Wilma! Open up, Catherine! Open up-- [water spraying] [Sally screaming] - Now, calm down! [Sally laughing hysterically] [Burt chuckling] - Hey, stop it, stop it! [Sally grumbling] - No, stop it! - No, goddamn it! - You gotta calm down! No! [screams] Oh it's cold, it's so cold! Stop it! Drunk, you're drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk! [Sally screaming] And quiet! Man! - Fuck you! [Sally shrieking] [door buzzing] - It's the livers of a certain breed of goose. It's raised in a small village just over the border from Switzerland. Now, the secrets of how to breed and raise these geese have been passed down for generations. The bird's abdomen is massaged daily by the supple fingers of Alsatian girls to purify the tissue. I mean, it's not food, man. It's art. - It's liverwurst, brother. - Pardon me, sir. Your friend is extolling the merits of Alsatian foie gras, undoubtedly the world's finest. Uh, I myself am a partisan of a slightly less known region-- - Do you like cigars? - No. Uh, not an aficionado. - Hmm, that's too bad. Well, I myself am a cop. - We're looking for a tiara. A rhinestone tiara, would have been placed with you in the last three days. - Oh, well, I-I'm afraid all of my tiaras have been in stock some time. Uh, you see, we don't have a large request for that sort of thing. - Have you sold any lately? - Uh, no. - Well, there you go. - But I do have a wonderful selection of heart-shaped ankle bracelets, and for the well-pierced, some very tasteful costume-gemmed nose and nipple rings. Uh, if-if not for you, maybe for your wife or girlfriend? - I don't think so. - They make wonderful Christmas gifts. - Alsatian foie gras. - How do you serve this stuff up? - Preferably with a nice truffle sauce. - Truffle, chocolate? Liver and chocolate? What are you, sick? - Man, you're hopeless. - Nothing on the nationwide. That's good, that means they haven't found a body yet. All right, let's check every motel from Tampa as far south as San Juan by five o'clock. - I do have another job, remember? - Yes, I do, honey. Didn't mean to press you. - [Charley] I'll try to get a temp to track down the information, all right? - All right, thank you. I appreciate that. - [Charley] I'm still mad about last night, you chauvinist pig. - I know you are honey. Listen, can we talk about this later? - [Charley] You're still on probation, you know? - All right, thank you, bye-bye. - Begging and groveling, it becomes you. - Thank you. I gotta make a stop. - I should have never given you that case. We're supposed to be-- - Supposed to what? Be anticipating a run on rhinestone tiaras? [chuckling] I think the pawn shop can wait a few minutes. Man, why don't you relax, buddy boy? Why doesn't everybody just relax? - It's been a long time, hasn't it? Don't worry, Italians are my specialty. Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm! God, who did your hair? Don't speak. An emergency procedure during Hurricane Andrew done by someone straight. God knows no friend of Dorothy would ever have done this to you. - She said she was going up to her family estate for a few days. - With her brother, Thomas? - Yeah, with Thomas. [upbeat pop music] - [Jack] Uh, do you know Thomas? - Catherine talks about him all the time, but I've never met him. - Well, I've seen his picture. Ooh, you can give that boy my number any time. ♪ Ooh, give that tin man my heart ♪ - Where's her station? - Over there. - Press-on nails. - I know she lost her parents in some godawful car crash about a year ago. Way too Jayne Mansfield. - Any friends? - Sally. - Sally Willows? Blonde gal? - Bottle blonde. - Two bottles, hmm? [hairdressers chuckling] Watch out for that witch, she is the wicked fuckin' witch of the west. Honey, she will neuter you so fast, you'll think you stopped off at the vet's. Relax, you're safe with me, Fabio. - So, how about a manicure? - Uh, I don't think so. [sander whirring] [Jack whistling] - What? - Can I come aboard? - Oh, whatever, suit yourself. [sander whirring] Oh, damn it, Jack! I don't know why we are struggling to fix this boat when we can't even live together. I mean, we speak different languages, and-and-and I don't mean Spanish/English. - What are you talking about? I'm talking about living together. You know, like for you, it's a huge sacrifice, commitment, and for me, it's sharing a life. You know, I mean, some guys get it and some guys don't get it. And you are definitely in the don't camp. - I got you a little surprise. - What? - Foo gwa. - [Charley] What? - Foo gwa. [Charley laughing] - You see what I mean? Different languages. I call it liverwurst. Oh, and by the way, it's foie gras, okay? - [Jack] Did you get that temp? - Oh yeah, I did, and uh, they checked hotels and, you know, everywhere, and couldn't find nothing. You think she's still alive? - I don't know, I can't read this one. - I can't either. [dramatic music] - I don't think you're doing your fair share of work, son. That so? - I don't know, sir. - We'll have to do something about this. I want to see you load all these oranges up in the back of the truck. - All of them? By myself? - Do I have to use my belt on you? - William. - Goddamn it, Mary, the boy flunked physical education. I never heard of a kid flunking gym before. I'm gonna teach my son to be a man, any way I have to. You understand? Do you understand? - Yes. - You'll do what I tell you if you know what's good for you. Now go, boy. And I don't want none of you Julios a-helpin' him neither, comprenden? Or y'all be lookin' for work in another goddamn grove. What? Get in the truck. [water running] - Does that hurt? - No, no, not-not really. - You sure? I'm so sorry, Thomas. [phone ringing] - Ah? - [Joe] Thomas? Uncle Joseph. - Hello, Uncle Joe. - Did you get your check? - Yep. - Did you put it in the bank? - Not yet. - Are you taking your medication? - [Thomas] Yep. - Good, good, good. Listen, Catherine's never coming back here. It's just not gonna happen. I want you to accept that. Do you understand me? Do you understand me, son? - Yes, sir. - You'll be happier this way. Trust me. You'll understand. - Medication... ♪ Twinkle, twinkle, little star ♪ ♪ How I wonder where you are ♪ Way above the earth so high ♪ Like a diamond ♪ In the sky ♪ Twinkle, twinkle, little star ♪ ♪ Don't I wish I was in the bar ♪ [laughing] [tense music] ♪ Twinkle, twinkle, little - Oh, you're here to make up, aren't you? No, no, don't speak. Let's capture this moment before it floats away like a tiny little bubble, above the earth so high. I do ramble on, don't I? - Here's the manager, let's go to the manager. - No, we don't have to go the manager. - No, let's go to the manager. - It's over there. - I know where we're going! - No, let's just do it right, we'll go to the manager-- - Oh, yeah. - And then they won't think we're breaking in. - You're always right, here. - Gimme those keys. - Yeah, I'm-I'm always wrong. [knocking] [Charley sighing] You see, he's not in, come on, let's go-- - Wait. - Well he's-- [knocking] We know where it is, Jack, ask him-- [loud rock music] - How may I be of service to you guys? Whoa, chief. There-there's no contraband in there, man. Here. Try-try a hit of this. - Oh no, he doesn't like this. - Wait a second. Wait a second, what do we got here? Joyo del Mundo. - Joya. - Joya, jewel of the earth. - No, of the world. - The world, jewel of the world. - [Charley] Yeah, you never remember anything-- - Hey, whoa, whoa, guys. Like, it's the best Cubans that money can buy. - [Jack] That's right, how much you pay? - 80 bucks. - 80 bucks? I can get 'em for 70. - Whoa, really? - Jack, we're not here for you to sell your cigars, okay? I mean, we're here on business, okay? I mean, just get on with this. We're looking for Catherine Amos. - Mason. - Mason, Mose, Mason. - Mason. - Mason! - Catherine Mason lives here. She-she's in trouble? - No. - Yes. - No she's not. - Well, she is. We think, we don't know. - She kept to herself, mostly. - Friends? - Uh, not really. - How about a gal, she has blonde hair, late 30s. Her name is Sally Willows. - Sally Will, you-you know Sally Willows? Man, like she was, she was just here. I-I, you know, it was like, uh, night, night before last, I think. You know it's the time thing. You know, when you start to leave this plane of existence, it's like you immediately realize how ephemeral and confining time really is. - You're tellin' me. - It's a real downer, man. - Yeah. - Well, um, yeah, so-so you said that-that Sally was here. About what time? - It-it was like, uh, you know, one, 1:30 in the morning. - Did you hear Catherine? - Well no, that's just it. She wasn't even here. Yeah, I mean, Sally's poundin' on the door. She was totally out of touch with her center. - Hmm. - It was like her karmic energy was like, stuck in-in the wrong chakra. You-you know, man? - Yeah. - Oh. - And-and so like I gave it just, you know, a little jolt, uh, to move her psy-psychic energy like to a whole different, uh, level. - That's good. - Yeah. - And then what happened? - Uh, oh, she left, man. I mean, uh, you know, I don't, I don't even know if I helped her to find her center, you know, but [chuckles] it-it did get her to leave. - Hmm. - Good. - Yeah, here-here it is. - Thanks. - Okay. Hey, no, uh-uh. Do you, do you mind staying here and smoking your cigar so that maybe you can find, uh, your center? - Hey, f-fine by me, little chief. - [Charley] Good. - Yo dude, I-I'm gonna wait right here. I wanna get your number about some cheaper Cubes? - Cool. - I'll be here. - Here, babe. Here. In case this becomes a crime scene, you know? [voicemail beeping] - [Pamela] Hi, Catherine, it's Pamela. Uh, call my phone number please. - [Jack] This must be her. - Hmm, cute. - Quickly, bye. - Uh, can I-- - So what are we doing? Tampering with the crime scene here? - Oh, come on, she's gonna come waltzing in that door any minute with Tony Montana on her arm with a big smile, looking at us, wondering what the hell we're doing and call the police on us. [chuckling] - Ay-yi-yi. - [Jack] Man, I can't stand that. - What? - Chicks and answering machines. Yada-yada-yada-yada. - [Pamela] Catherine? Pamela here. I'm getting right there, okay? - No comment. - This is a funky little place. - [Pamela] I don't know what's going on, I'll forgive you. Just show up, thanks. - You know, that is a little concerning. - What's that? - Did you ever know a girl not to check her answering machine at least four times a day? You'd think she'd listen to messages and erase 'em. - Four times a day, huh? - Well, well, at least two. - You know, I thought, uh, Thomas dropped her off. - That's what he said. - Well, there's no blow dryer here. No make-up, no toothbrush. And the towels are dry. - [Jack] Well, either she's and gone-- - Or she never came back. [sniffing] - This smells familiar. [sniffing loudly] - Mmm, brilliant observation, detective. That's my perfume, Midnight Passion. [Jack chuckling] - I knew that. The smell of that makes me horny. - The smell of soap makes you horny. - Hmm... [phone ringing] - Stop, we're working here. - Hello. - [Nick] It's Nick. Another transvestite was murdered down at the pier. - All right, I'll, I'll meet you there. Sorry, I gotta go, real work. You're on your own, Sherlock. What do we got? - Another decomposing cross-dresser, not too far gone. Probably last night. Surfer spotted the body about an hour ago. - Name's Carl Spoon. - His name's Carlina. The most beautiful girl in the world. - Looks like she got done by a ball-peen. - Yep, just like the others. - Does that leave us any possible leads? - It sure does. Every owner of a steel-hulled boat in Southern Florida uses 'em to pound the dents out. - Cigarette burn on the dead man's face. - We found a cigarette butt at the last scene. It wasn't tobacco, though. - Hey, hey, let's keep that under wraps. - No problem. - Clove, Canadian brand. Lab that says that, uh, lipstick found on the last butt was also imported. - Gentlemen, this makes number four. I don't want to see number five, huh? Olsen, you're in charge. - [Nick] Olsen? - This guy used to hang out at the Ignition. I suggest we start with the nightclub scene. - Parking tickets. The guy had over 40 outstanding parking tickets, and you are gonna sort 'em out. In addition to every ticket issued within a one mile radius of every murder scene within the last 24 hours. - Are you kidding? - That's how they caught the Son of Sam, junior. Are you guys too good for that? - So, I'm sorry we don't have much yet. No police reports. We haven't found her in the hospital or morgues. - Well, I guess that's good. - Oh yeah, it's good. And then we've been searching hotels, car rentals, we checked her place-- - So in the meantime, I'm just gonna have to wait, is that what're you're telling me? - Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, you have any ideas? - Not really, I didn't know many of her friends. Maybe you ought to talk to Uncle Joe. - Okay. Who the hell is Uncle Joe? - I told you about him, at the bar. - Oh yeah, I remember, yeah. - He takes care of the groves, he lives at the house. - Okay, yeah. And-and what about your parents? - They died in a car accident two years ago. Catherine and me are the only ones left in the family, except for Uncle Joe. He showed up at my parents' funeral, and he never left. - Hmm, why, why is that? - Do I get to ask you some personal questions? [dramatic music] - Oh, you know, just, we're just trying to find your sister. - I know. Uncle Joe. Uncle Joe. - Uncle Joe. - Who knows why he does what he does? He's been married a couple of times. Been in trouble with cocaine. Got three years' probation. I think he was lonely. That's why he came back. My grandpa hated him. Joe was a rebel. He didn't work a regular job. He wasn't into the home and family thing. Grandpa left everything to my dad. But Uncle Joe is trustee of the estate until Catherine and I turn 35. - You miss her a lot, don't you? - I feel like a part of me is gone. - Tell me about her. - She's, uh, kind. She's very smart. She's my best friend. Growing up on the farm together, we were playing all the time. She was everything I wanted to be. I thought the world began and ended in Grove 38. That's her, uh, her special grove. My dad even named it after her. Catherine's Grove. - [Jack] I spent the whole afternoon going through parking tickets. I feel like I'm in exile or something. - I had lunch with Thomas. - Well? - Mmhmm. - Spending an awful lot of time with my client, aren't you? - Mm-mm, our client. Mmm. We went to his house, ah, such a beautiful house. Oh Jack, you know, it's like, right on the beach, and it's so romantic. - Yeah? - Yeah. - And where do you think he got the cash to buy a joint like that, huh? - Hmm. - Probably selling drugs at the local high school. [Charley sighing] - How about family money? - Family money? - Yeah, family money. - What a waste. Let me ask you something. - [Charley] Yeah? - Who's the least likely person to commit a crime? - The victim. - [Jack] Seriously, who would you least suspect? - Hmm, I dunno. - The person who reports it. - No! - Yes. - You-you-you think that Tom is involved? - Absolutely. - But why? - It's very simple. Greed. He wants Catherine's half of the estate. - That's ridiculous. - You think so? - Yeah, completely, of course. I mean, just face it, okay? I mean, you don't like the guy because, because he's just, uh, so different from your beer-sucking, ball-scratching cop buddies. - Let me tell you something, Charley. That guy is beach trash. I bust punks like that every day. - If your life ever evolved past the caveman stage, [chuckles] you would understand what I'm talking about. You know, can I ask you something? You know, if you had that kind of money, how would you live your life? - If I had his kind of money? - Yeah. - I tell you what, I'd be livin' large, man. Balls to the wall, pedal to the metal, flyin' down the highway, wind in my face in a 1967 candy apple red Corvette. And I would also have a 35 foot cigarette bowl with 454 twin engine Chevys blastin' black and forth to the Bahamas every day. Probably have a couple chicks in there too. - What about me? - Um... - Don't say anything. I... [sighing] Case closed. - All right, well, anyway, I don't have his kind of money and I don't know what I'd do with it, but I'll tell you what. This neanderthal man... - What? - Neanderthal, that's caveman, you called me caveman. This caveman's beer gut instinct tells me that Catherine never came back on Sunday, and Thomas knows a hell of a lot more than he's tellin' us. - You really think so? - Mmhmm, absolutely. - Okay. Well, you know, before you get too crazy with your ideas about hanging Thomas and all that, I think you should just go up there and meet with Uncle Joe. He's the one running the estate. - I think I will. Meanwhile, why don't you drop in on Sally Willows? I think she'd be a little more comfortable talking to another woman, if you know of which I speak. [birds chirping] - I think you'll find everything's in order. All you have to do is sign on the dotted line, Mr. Mason, and the money's moved. - Fine. - Are you sure you want to do this? - I've never been more sure about anything in my life. I am the trustee, right? - You got that right, sir. [dramatic music] - This is a letter from my doctor. I've got a little problem with my nerves. He-he thinks I should take a few days off. - Uh, this isn't exactly the best time. I mean, we've got some dead bodies around here. - Yeah, I know sir. I... But I also know that you [chuckles] you think I'm a bit of a screw-up and, otherwise, why would you have me on [sighs] pawn shop detail and checking parking tickets, and, look sir, I-I-I'm telling you, I think the answer is, is in those nightclubs. I-I just think that you're afraid you're gonna find the mayor down there or something. - Or-or half the city council. Look, we have people on the clubs. I mean, no stone's left unturned. - Yeah, well, that's what I'm talkin' about, see? You got it covered, you don't need me. And besides, I just, uh, [sighs] I don't know what's going on. I just need to lay down for a couple of days. - You're kiddin' me, right? - No, captain, I'm not kidding you. [breathing deeply] See, it's happening right now. I think I'm having another anxiety attack. Can I... Have a glass of water, please? - You're killin' me, Doyle. - Hey, man. I'm gonna take a couple days off. - What do you mean, a vacaion? - No, just a little R and R. - You're gonna leave me with 1,200 parking tickets! - Hey man, that's the way they caught Son of Sam. - I'm the one who got you this gig. It's supposed to be moonlighting. - Yeah, well, this guy knows a little more than he's lettin' on. - Oh really? - Do me a favor, go to the Ignition Club tonight will ya and check on this Catherine Mason? And while you're at it, check out this Carlina. Maybe we can get a line on the vestie murders. [sighing] Maybe you might wanna get some new clothes, you know?

Uh, your nephew Thomas, he-- - Is he all right? - No, he's, he's fine. He-he-he hired me to find his sister, Catherine. Did you know she was missing? - Missing? Well, I guess that's really not, uh, the right word for it, but-- - But you know where she is? - Uh, I do. I appreciate you coming all the way out here and, uh, taking out your time looking at this, but I can assure you that, uh, everything's in order. And, uh, my-my-my nephew, he-he-he tends to overreact sometimes. - Yeah. - And, you know... - Well then I guess you can explain why she hasn't talked to anybody in three days and she hasn't shown up for work? She didn't even leave her toothbrush in her apartment. [both laughing] - Yes, I can. Uh, because she's here. - She's here? - Yeah. - Well... Thomas said he took her back to her apartment. - Well, he might have, but then, uh, she came back out here. - But her car is still at her apartment. - Well, we've got lots of cars around here, uh, Detective. I appreciate you coming out and-and-and, look, there's really no big mystery going on. And Catherine is here, and she's fine. - Well, you don't mind if I talk to her? I just want to express Thomas' concern. - Well, uh [sighs] actually, we're a little bit more concerned about Thomas than we are about Catherine. Thanks very much. Take care. - Thank you. [dramatic music] Well... [phone beeping] [phone ringing] - Yeah. - Thomas? Uh, listen, we got a problem. And you've got to let her go. - I'm really worried about her. - You gotta stop worrying about her and you gotta stop thinking about her altogether. You listen to your Uncle Joe, if you know what's good for you. And fire Mr. Doyle today, you understand me? - Yeah, I'll try. - [Joe] No, don't try, you do it. - Do you mind if I smoke? Well, it's my house. So, you wanna know where Catherine is? I suggest you ask Thomas. - He's the one who hired us to find her. - Really? - Yeah, really. Surprises you? - Nothing surprises me anymore. - How do you know Catherine? - I met her at a club, down at the beach. Hmm, a couple of months ago. - Ignition? - You know it? - No, I've heard of it. - That's the problem with those damn clubs. The minute you feel comfortable in one, everyone knows about it. - Yeah, it's a big problem. [chuckling] So, do you know Catherine well? - Well, we get together from time to time. - How do you know Thomas? - Well, actually, it was Catherine who introduced me to Thomas. Look... I care a great deal about both of them, hmm? They're like family to me. - And you just met them a couple of months ago? - Miss Vas-quez-- - Vasquez. - Yeah. I'm sure you come from a very large family, being Latino and all, but some of us, we have to take what we can get, hmm? [phone ringing] - Hola. Thomas? Thomas, are you all right? Listen, wait for me, okay? Don't go anywhere, I'll be there in five minutes. Thomas, I'll be there right away, okay? Okay. [Thomas sobbing] Thomas, Thomas! - No! - Thomas! Thomas! - No! [bottle shattering] - Thomas? - You fuckin' bitch! - What's wrong? What? - Get away from me! - What's wrong, Thomas, what's wrong? - I thought you and Jack cared about me! - Oh, Thomas, we-we do care about you. - She's been gone a week! She's been gone almost two weeks! - I know, and we're doing everything we can to find her. You gotta trust me. What? [dramatic music] - I think I know where she is. - [Charley] What is it? - I think I know what happened to her. [Thomas sobbing] - [Charley] What? What happened? - I remember... No! - Shh, calm down! - I know! - Calm down, it's okay. - I think I killed her. - What? - He made me do it. He made me bury her in the groves. - Who made you do it? Who, who? Who? - Uncle Joe. - You listen to your Uncle Joe if you know what's good for you. - Uncle Joe, we buried her in the groves, in Grove 38. In Catherine's Grove. - Oh my God. - He made me do it. - Oh God. It's all right. - He made me do it! - It's okay. It's okay, baby. [Thomas sobbing] Oh, God. - Are you at his apartment now? - I think he's harmless. Yeah, well, he's sleeping right now. - Harmless? What are you talking about, Charley? The guy just told you he killed his sister. I don't want you there alone, call Pirelli. - Okay, I will. Baby, do you know where Catherine's Grove is? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've got the directions. Don't worry about that. I do not want you there alone. Call Pirelli, now. - Okay, I promise I will, all right? Now you be careful with the uncle, okay? - I can take care of the uncle. Call him, now. I'll talk to you later, bye. - Goodbye, I love you. [phone beeping] [phone ringing] [voicemail beeping] - [Nick] Hi, it's Nick. I'm not here right now. Leave me a message. [voicemail beeping] - Yeah, hi Nick, it's Charley. And, uh, well, I'll just call you back later. Okay, bye. [suspenseful music] - Oh boy... What the hell? [tense music] Ah! [breathing heavily] - There she is. You're a bit, uh, jumpy for a detective, aren't you? - It's my first grave. [Jack chuckling] - You got a warrant? - No, I don't. - Come on up outta there. I'll tell you a story. [dramatic music] [phone ringing] [voicemail beeping] - [Nick] Hi, it's Nick. I'm not here right now. Leave me a message. [door buzzing] - [Bouncer] What do you want? - I wanna get in. I'm supposed to meet some friends here. - [Bouncer] You look like a cop. - I'm friends with Jack Doyle. - [Bouncer] That's our kinda cop. - [Joe] How do you take it, detective? - Straight. - [Joe] That makes two of us. - Thank you. - I was kinda hoping that, uh, you'd keep your nose where it belonged, and stop sniffin' around in other people's business. - This is my business, your nephew hired me. Look, all I want is the truth and I'll just [laughs] I'll just go home, collect my fee and be on my way. - Yeah. I don't know how much truth is possible in all this. Going all the way down the coast, are you? Gonna do some dancin', huh? I bet you will. Have a good time and don't worry about them kids. I'll take good care of 'em, all right? - Thanks, Joe. - All right. Have a good time, and I'll see you. Come back when you feel like it. - Bye, dad. - I was pretty wild then. - [Young Thomas] Bye. - I was stupid, heedless. But sometimes, uh, you don't know 'til it's too late. Okay you kids, now, your Uncle Joe only has one rule, okay? You don't bother me, and I won't bother you. Okay? - Yeah. - Is that a deal. - That's a deal. - All right. - Okay. Run along and play now. - Bet I'll beat ya! - Come on! - Things got a bit out of hand. Mostly my fault, I guess. Hey. What'd you bring me? - Some candy for your sweet tooth, baby. [chuckling] - Get on up here. - Let's party. [slow rock music] I need another bump, babe. [sniffing] - Thomas, get away from that door! What'd I tell you? - Just leave him alone. - What did I tell you? [dramatic music] Catherine! Catherine, I know that's you! - Thomas! - Get back here! Catherine! - Thomas! Thomas, help me in! Help me in, Thomas! - No! - Catherine! - You'll get me in trouble. - Get back down from there! You listen to your Uncle Joe, if you know what's good for you. - Help me in! - No, you'll get me in trouble. - Get your ass back down here! - Let me in, Thomas! - No! - Right now! Don't make me come up there! - [Young Thomas] No! [Catherine yelling] - No! - No! - I as good as killed her. At least, that's the way I see it. We left the room exactly as it was, kind of a memorial I guess. Uh... [dramatic music] Ah, that's the last picture of her ever taken. - [EMT] Excuse us, please. Stepping in, please clear. Okay Tony, legs up. Excuse us. Okay, that'll do it. Okay, door closing. - What the hell were you doing up in that tree house at night? - Bill. - Huh? - [Joe] Bill, he didn't do nothing. - What the hell were you doing up there, huh? What were you doing up there? - It's not what you think! - [William] It's your fault she's dead! It's your fault! - No, no, no! - She's dead, damn it, it's your fault! - No! - Goddamn! [William sobbing] - Thomas... - I guess I never really had the guts to, uh, tell anybody the truth about what happened that night. It was an accident, you know? Uh, Thomas... Never said a word. Never said a word about it to anybody. I guess I... I don't know, I guess I always figured I kind of owed him for that. Owed him big time. - [Jack] Got some company. - [Joe] Oh, that's someone I'd like you to meet. His name's Dr. Lee. [frenetic dance music] - Scotch and soda. - [Nick] Thanks. - I couldn't bear to ruin good single malt. I'll let you do it. It's on the house. - Thanks. Excuse me. You ever know a Carl Spoon? - Not really. - How about Carlina? You know her? - Very well. - You see her the night she died? - Sure. Here. Stoli on the rocks, that's what she liked. Russian ice cream, she called it. - Anything unusual happen? - Nah, nothing much. Well, there was a little argument between Carlina and Sally. - Sally Willows, bottle blonde? - Yeah, she left with Catherine. Yeah. That's her. - Any cops ever ask you about this? - You're the first. But, um, if you know Doyle, everything's okay. [dramatic music] - Joe and I have been friends for a long time. Joe brought Thomas to me so that I could help him live a more normal, integrated life. We thought we were making progress. - Why does Thomas keep Catherine alive? - Listen, my brother Bill used to beat up on Thomas. You know, he was always smackin' him around for one thing or another, and the poor kid lost all of his self-confidence, all of his self-worth. The only person that ever seemed to care about him at all was Catherine. She was kind of his, um, his lifeline, his strength. - [Dr. Lee] Catherine was a person that Thomas could never be. Someone loved. - See, daddy? Catherine's all right. She's okay. [belt lashing] [Young Thomas groaning] - Goddamn it! No son of mine is gonna fuck around with this girl shit! [belt lashing] [Young Thomas groaning] - I... I love you, dad. - He disassociates. It's a common defense mechanism for abused children. If you can't fight back, and you can't escape, you go somewhere else in your mind. You create another personality to take care of the pain. - Lately, things have been, uh, getting a lot worse, as you know. Catherine, uh, is becoming more real. - We thought that by recreating the funeral ceremonies, by burying that wig, we could put Catherine to rest. - Man, burying wigs? The more I listen to you two guys, the more I think you're crazy. - Listen, young man. Thomas is only dangerous to himself. - Why don't you send him home? - Here? - Yeah. I'm the only one that cares about him. - Let me ask you this. Uh, do you care about Thomas, or his money? [Dr. Lee chuckling] - That money that Thomas has is not family money, it belongs to Joe here. - That's right, it's mine. I made it on my own. - Yes. He has funded the family trust for many years. - Listen... [clearing throat] I'm dying. Plain and simple. I'm dying of cancer. Thomas is the only thing left that I care about. He's my nephew, and I love him. He's the only one left on the tree, and I want to protect him. [sighing] He's the only reason I ever came back here. I bought this place out of foreclosure. I did the right thing with my money. [dramatic music] [phone beeping] [phone ringing] [dial tone ringing] [phone beeping] [phone ringing] - Who are you? - Thomas? - Thomas isn't here. - Well, I can see that. Loud and clear. - I demand to know, who are you? - I'm Charley. - Charley. You fucking my brother? - No, I'm, I'm just his friend. - I don't think he has any friends. I'm his only friend. - Catherine? - Shut up! Can't you see I'm trying to think? I gotta get back home. Uncle Joe's trying to get rid of me. I can't let daddy treat Thomas this way. I'm still wondering who you are? Thomas doesn't deserve this. Uncle Joe wants all the money. They mock us. Oh, I need to be at the wedding. Need to call Pamela. Sally knows. Don't let them bury me. Don't let them bury me. Charley, don't leave me. Please. [slow Latin guitar music] Would you like to dance? - Um... I'd love to. [suspenseful music] [tires screeching] Oh, what beautiful tattoos you have. - Don't. Don't, don't. - They're just like Thomas'. - Don't. Don't, don't! Don't try to confuse me! Don't try. - Catherine-- - Hey, take your hands off her. I said take your fucking hands off her! - Oh my God! - It's okay Charley. Do it, take the fucking wig off! Take the wig off, you goddamn freak! - Stop that! - It's okay, Charley. It's okay. - It's not okay! Why are you doing that? - It's okay, it's okay! - You stupid idiot! - What are you doing? - What are you doing with that? - What's the matter with you? - What's the matter with you? - I'm trying to help you here! - Well, you're not helping me! Oh, get away from him! You make a mess of everything! Always have to use a goddamn gun! Shh! It's okay. Just... [Charley breathing heavily] It's okay. [waves lapping] - Sorry about the gun, Thomas. I guess I overreacted a little bit. - It's not a problem. - And, uh, we talked to your uncle, and he's waiting for you. - You sure you can make the drive alone? - Yeah, I'll be fine. Thanks for everything. - Sure. - [Thomas] You two make a great couple, by the way. - Oh. [chuckles] - Yeah, well, thanks. I'll put your bags in the car. - Well... Bye. - Nasty-smelling things, those cigars. - No kidding. - If you want him to quit smoking cigars, you should have him try one of these clove cigarettes. They're Sally's. Nastiest things you can imagine. - Thank you. [waves lapping] - I've been, uh, thinking about us. And I know I can do better. And, uh, well... If you stick around, I'll work on my end. - I wasn't planning to go anywhere. - Well... I was also thinking about, well... [both chuckling] - What? - I sure could use a cigar. - Well, you know how much I hate these, but Thomas wanted you to have them, and, uh, he doesn't like them, they were Sally's. - These are clove cigarettes. - [Charley] Yeah, so? - Our killer wears imported lipstick, smokes clove cigarettes, is Sally's height, and kills transvestites. Where does Sally live? - On Seminole, by the Galleria. [knocking] [keys jingling] - Looking for something? - Jeez, Sal. - Well, I guess Catherine's found. So why this now? We can move on. I'm not talking Catherine and me. I'm talking you and me. And you and me and Catherine. - I don't want to be here, can't you see that? - [Sally] No, I can't. - Catherine loves you, not me. - Catherine doesn't exist, Thomas. - Watch it, Sally. - Okay. - [Thomas] Goddamn it, where... - Not there. [phone ringing] - Hello? - Nick? I'm gonna need backup. - Huh? - 3800 Seminole. I think we found our murderer. - Okay. - 10 minutes? - I'll be right there. - All right. - You mind just, you know, stopping at the stop sign, at least once in a while? - Oh, shit. - We belong together, Thomas. - Belong with you? - Mmhmm. - You're so pathetic, Sal. I don't want you. Maybe Catherine liked you, but not me. Get that through your fuckin' head, you stupid cow. - She just can't vanish. Her love for me cannot disappear. - Yes it can. It did, it's gone. - No, you can't do this to me! You're all I have! - Get over it! - Uh-uh. - Catherine's moved on. Now let me get her stuff and get outta here! - Oh, you want her stuff? You wanna get outta here? This, huh? Is this what you're looking for? Mementos? Oh, little mementos! Little girlie-girl times on the town, huh? Remember? You know, I kept your secret. I protected you. [Sally breathing heavily] I kept your secret that you were two different people. Oh, the vesties knew, but they didn't mean any harm. They just wanted to know your tricks of the trade. But you couldn't stand that they would see you for who you really are. Do you think you deserved it when your daddy beat you? [dramatic music] Or did you like it? [suspenseful music] [tires screeching] - What took you so long? - Second floor. - Hey, Thomas. Or Catherine. Whoever the fuck you are now. [gun cocking] Listen to me. I covered for you. They mocked you. I protected you. I loved you. You're not gonna walk out on me now. I found a little hammer with some blood on it. Is that what you were looking for? - You're really crazy, Sally. And everybody knows it. - I may be-- [door crashing] [Sally shouting] - Drop the weapon! [Sally yelling] [guns firing] [Sally groaning] - Found this in the back closet. It looks like the murder weapon. This lipstick matches the same kind found on the cigarette at the murder scene on the beach. She had an argument with Carl Spoon the night he was murdered. She also smoked clove cigarettes, so everything points to Sally Willows. - Hmm. - She was also very popular on the underground party circuit. - And of course, you know it well. - Yes, I do. - Well, it looks as though we got our serial killer. - It looks as though Pirelli and I have our serial killer. - You know, I gotta tell you something. This is a good example of how a complete fuck up lucks into solving a case. - Well, that may be true. But at least give Pirelli credit, he's a hero. You ought to give him a medal or something. [birds chirping] [Joe coughing] - Is there anything you need right now, Tom? - A nap would be nice. - All right, then. Well, it's nice to have you back. [dramatic music] - Thomas! - No! - Thomas, let me in! - No. - Please, Thomas! - No, I can't. - [Catherine] No! No! No! [dramatic music] - Hello, Uncle Joe. Surprised to see me? [objects clattering] You thought you could bury me, didn't you, Joe? In my own grove. But you're not gonna get away with it. - Jack, Jack, Jack! My darling! [Charley speaking foreign language] Yes, yes, yes! - What, what? - Paid in full by the uncle! - Oh yeah. - Yeah! - That's over three payments on the boat. - Looks beautiful, doesn't it? - Hmm. - Yeah. Okay, hold me, hold me. Yes, hold me, baby. I love you. - I love you. [Charley giggling] Ay... So you know, I was wondering. Do you think we'll ever get this thing out on the water? - Sure we will. - Yeah? - Right after we get married. - Oh! [Jack chuckling] Oh, baby. I don't know if I can wait that long. [sighs] It's beautiful. Hmm... Well, here she is. - Well, I don't think she's gonna be bothering anyone ever again. Case closed. - Here, Blue. Come here boy, that's it. Come here. That a boy. All right Blue, sit down, sit, boy. Attaboy. You'll do what your Uncle Joe tells you if you know what's good for you. [chuckling] [dramatic music] [uptempo Latin guitar music]
