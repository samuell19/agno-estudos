Bharatan A fake seer, who sexually abused a 16 old boy on the pretext of curing the boys illness through his prayers, from Thrikkunnapuzha in Alappuzha district, today Morning The Fake seer, Abdul karim, hails from pathanapuram in Kollam district He was arrested by the Police under the POSCO act, In the morning , Abdul karim visited the house of the victim and enquired about the family The plus one student’s mother informed the fake seer that her son is suffering from fever Abdul Karim, on convincing her that he can cure the boy with his prayers took him in to a room and abused him By the time the neighbours rushed to the house, hearing the mothers loud cry Welcome Sunita Prabhakar, Reporter of Sky news This is an amazing surprise I have been trying to get through to you on the phone for the last two months. Where were you? Babe, my job is not to walk around holding a mike, like you do Nobody can predict when a private detectives phone might get turned off Won’t ask you about more things. What is the idea behind your arrival? I am chasing a chase, which can’t be said to be murder or unnatural death One Mr. Mohammed from Malappuram who was working as sale man in Dubai, went missing suddenly one day After three days, his corpse was brought home When his body was being bathed, relatives saw many surgical marks on the body They approached me with this case After some days, his family got 25 lakhs Once they saw the money they backed out of the case, but I for some reason, didn’t feel like leaving this case I continued my investigation and found out that, not just Mohammed but two more Malayali employees from the same supermarket had gone missing under the same circumstances One Mr. Gopi from Trivandrum and Juby from Wayanad You mean, similar operation marks on their body too? Yes, it was there. Even their families got 25 lakhs, from Golden hands charitable trust I once attempted to do an exclusive story on this charitable trust Okay The Binami’s of this charitable trust owns, super markets, construction companies and hospitals in the gulf dead bodies are supplied to medical colleges from the old age homes run by them I received information from a true source I did an exclusive story The channel did not air it When I enquired about it, it was the same Golden hands charitable trust behind it Hmm yes. Many similar allegations like this had come up against this trust, but for this case, i think they are involved in Donor Mafia Okay I understood that all three of them had lost their internal organs So same people, same company, Golden hands charitable trust I feel that there is some connection Okay Master I know that you have started hearing bad news there too That lady detective is also missing. Don’t know what to do Hire a Contract killer The police department also is suspicious about the activities of Golden hands, but without any strong evidence, we can’t do anything I know that. My idea was to find out the full details of the trust, including the pre medical camps they held whether you can collect for me Okay, I will try. Anything more? Hmm, okay Jagan, you be careful They are too dangerous Come in You guys sit, I will bring something to drink Anu, what happened to you? Why are you not stepping out at all? We all really miss you Anu? Anu... Anu, why are you avoiding us like this? We can’t bear to see you like this What happened to you, Anu? Anu, did you know , in our boney’s class She has been like this for some days Don’t worry, she will become all right What is t? What happened? Aunty, I will be back in a bit What is it? Say what it is? no aunty, nothing Where did they go? Brother Vivek, Brother Vivek, this has some videos of Anu in it. What is it? That What is in it? Check it Come Come, Arjun you come with me. Rahul, you stay here Brother Vivek, that’s the place Is this? Are you sure that, this is the place? Yes, this is the place Hmmm... Okay Right A total of 740 camps have been conducted under chengannoor foundation in Kerala. From 737 camps out of them, nothing like what we suspected has been reported From 3 camps, Nadakkavu in Kozhikode, Mannuthy in Thrissur and Perumbavoor in Ernakulam from these three, one person each has gone missing. Though the characteristics of all three cases are the same, but we are unable to find a link. So... we need to find out how to move ahead now. I don’t think that these missing case and the blood bank have any connection In India, no private person can run a blood bank on his own That is the rule Then these many number of blood donation camps There is something else going on behind this Jagan, tell me one of the missing persons name The guy who went missing from Kozhikode is Ratish Tell me the other two names Athira Gagan Gokul, She is from Assam Got it. A rare blood group, Bombay O Positive All the three people who went missing have this same blood group All over India, there are only fewer than 400 people with this rare blood group Their organs sell for crore’s in the international market Can you check and tell whether there is anyone else with this blood group There is one more person Shit Sir, this? Yes Jagan, do you know this kid? Can you check the date and tell me when she took part in this camp? If we get the details Yes, Thirteenth of this month Jagan, what happened? Yes, on this 15th even this kid got kidnapped but the very next day she escaped from their clutches and came back I figured out that she was abducted by a Tamilian and two Hindi speaking guys Yes Jagan, this is that for sure That kid would have seen her kidnappers, through her we can reach those guys I am sure, Jagan. There is a problem in it This kid’s family is not interested in pursuing the case There is one way for it, let us see Any old paper, plastic, iron scrap, bottles for sale?

I want to leave Vivek! Your investigation is never going to reach anywhere Anu wasn’t kidnapped by a small gang, like you believe. It’s a big Mafia Anu is not their first victim To reach them, I need your help No Vivek, it won’t work out. I know what i did to you was wrong I agree In that state of mine, things happened that way Please forgive me In the name of this I can’t send Anu along with you I don’t know when Emmanuel is going to be here Vivek, you leave No Aunty, Without Anu I won’t step out from this flat All your issues are sorted, but my situation is not like that I want to know who and what is behind all this All that won’t work out, Vivek It better work out I will see to that your daughter is unscathed You should trust me No, nothing can be said now.
