Goodbye. Menzi? Travel safe. Do not divorce your husband, my child. Do not part with him. Stay in the marriage as we did. Hang on. Everything shall be well. Things always get better. How can I stay with someone who doesn't want to stay with me? Muzi no longer loves me. He doesn't love you? No, my child. There is still hope. Stay as we did and be patient, my child. Even if it means you do it for Siya. He cannot grow up without his father being present. And you know what? He is still too young. He cannot know that his parents are fighting. Don't forget that kids hold memories, and they never forget until it becomes a wound. My grandson, you don't look pleased, my child. Granny, I want to go home. My child, what do you mean you want to go home? This is home as you see it. There's nothing missing here. It's still home, my child. What am I going to do? Please do tell, when last did you hear from Menzi? He's been quiet. We last spoke when he left for the city of gold. So he hasn't written to you? Well... everyone knows... that the city of gold changes men for the worst. Even the trustworthy ones. I'm telling you, sister. It's a good thing you came, sir. Your grandchild wrote you a letter. I think your letter should be in here. Excuse me. Siya. Siya, my grandson, please help me. Find his letter so you can read it out to him. Such a young child can read letters? Yes, he can. What is the good sir's name? Sontsele James Khuzwayo. Are all these letters mine? A dark cloud came over us when my husband died. He used to read the letters. Now they have piled up. My boy will help with the reading now. May I begin reading for you, sir? You may read for me, my son. Read. "Greetings, Grandfather. I trust you are well and that Granny is getting better. It makes me happy to tell you that I have passed all my modules." Oh. That's really her. It's really my granddaughter. "In this cold weather, I sleep next to a man... who snores like a pig." I apologize. "I miss your body close to me, keeping me warm throughout the night." Hello. May I please have some sugar? Hello, Nobuhle. Hello, granny. How are you? There's a letter for you here. As we were looking through the stack with my boy, we found a letter written out to you. Please wait as I go and fetch it. Hey, Siya. Look through these letters and look for a letter written out to Nobuhle Mthembu. And then you read the letter for her, my child. Can we go sit over there so I can read for you? "Hello, Nobuhle... my love. I trust you are well. The candle is about to burn out... so I will be brief. I traveled safely on my journey to the city of gold, and life around here is just fine. I trust you are doing well. I miss you very much, my love. During the night and day... I'm always thinking about you. I'll be back home... soon. Menzi." Thank you. I love you too. Hello, Nobuhle. I trust you are well. The candle is about to burn out. With that said, I'll be brief. I traveled safely on my journey to the city of gold, and life around here is just fine. You'll agree with me that our marriage has long died. Maybe it wasn't even alive. I have started a new life and home here in the city of gold. Due to that, I release you to start a new life without me. I apologize if this letter is received in the wrong light. I wish you a prosperous life. It is I, Menzi. Is everything going well, Siya? All is still going well, Grandmother. It's just that I feel a bit tired. Good morning, Nobuhle. -Good morning, granny. How are you? -We are doing well. Hello, Siya. Wow, aren't you such a beautiful lady. Wow. Your beauty is angelic. You are so beautiful. Hello, Nobuhle. There's a letter from your husband. So a letter makes you behave like this? Can we maybe go sit over there? Excuse me, young boy. My husband's name is Dumisani Cele. Haven't you come across a letter sent by that name? I'm not sure. I just knew that it's not there. It's fine. If you really want it... Maybe it's there. I'll look for it just in case. It's not there. I'll look for it. I promise. Is it fine if we sit here? Is everything okay, Siya? Yes, everything is going well. May I begin reading for you? "Hello, my love. My beautiful wife. I really miss you... and I love you. I miss your body... close to me... bringing me closer... keeping me warm... all through the night. I will come back... home very soon. I love you very much, my love. Menzi." Menzi. Nobuhle. You look beautiful. About the letter I wrote to you... I lost my job. Nobuhle. Siya. How are you? It's been a while. Yes. I wanted to let you know that today I'm going back home to the city of gold. You're going back to the city of gold? Yes. Travel safely, Siya. Thank you for everything you have done for me. I hope we will meet again. I hope so too. Oh. Looks like I have to leave now. Goodbye. Nobuhle! I have a letter from your husband. Goodbye. Did you enjoy your stay with your grandmother, my boy? Yes, I did. Mom, when can I come back to visit Granny again? You can come back whenever you'd like to, my boy. Yes, your mother is right, boy. You can come back whenever, but during school holidays.
