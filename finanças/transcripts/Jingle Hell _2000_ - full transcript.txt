[upbeat music] Peg: Seamus, the children haven't seen the new house. I want it clean. Seamus Fitzgerald, you're wearing white socks with business shoes. You look like an old man. Seamus: I am an old man, 65 years old. Peg: You're 64. Seamus: I'm in my 65th year. I get senior citizen prices at the movies, the video store, Denny's and Tuesday [unintelligible]. Peg: Now go change those socks before the children get here. Seamus: [sighs] Socks. Peg: Dark ones. Sean: I don't know. I wish I could. Yes, Exit 71 east. We'll be here. They'll be here in about 20 minutes. Jeanne: We can't wait 20 minutes. Sean: Well, we haven't got a choice, have we? Kate: I thought you said we were picking up a car at the airport? Scott: This is the airport. Kate: No, the airport is three miles away. This is a deserted parking lot. Scott: At least I found us a car Kate. It was either this or an '81 Chevette. Kate: Hey Scott, did the Chevette have a stick shift? Scott: Stick? I'm going to do it Kate, just you're making me nervous. Kate: Okay, okay, okay. Clutch. Scott: Would you take your hand off the stick shift please? Kate: Just, just, just - Scott: I can do this. I'm a grown up. [car screetching] I'm a man okay? Kate: Fine. Do it. We'll just spend the night here. Scott: Oh fine that's very encouraging. Kate: Look, just clutch and gas. Scott: I know that. Kate: Clutch. You're tearing up the transmission. Scott: Look, just leave me alone and let me drive will you? Peg: Seamus, hurry up. Children should be here soon. Mmm. Jeanne: Mom says the new house is very modern. I wonder what it looks like. Sean: Honey, Mom's idea of modern is built after the Civil War. Jackie: You know the Michaels went skiing this Christmas. Can't we do that instead? Jeanne: No, we can't. [Unintelligible] trip to the hospital. Sean: They made me an offer. Sarah: Dad, about Santa Claus. Jackie: And I'm not kissing Grandpa this year. He's got bad breath. Jeanne: Jackie stop it. Jackie: But it's true. I'm not kissing Grandpa. Sean: It's Dr. Fitzgerald. Can you page Dr. Ralph with Pediatric Oncology? Jeanne: I don't care if it's true. You kiss your grandfather or you're in trouble. Now settle down. Sarah: Can we get a puppy? Sean: I'm checking the bloodwork on Elizabeth Westley. Jeanne: Animals don't fit in Santa's sleigh. Peg: You're alone I see. Did you call him like I said? Meghan: Yes, Mom. I called David and left a message on his machine. Okay? Peg: Don't worry. He'll come. Nothing's so bad that it can't be worked out. Every marriage has its little problems. Brian: Has its little problems. Leave her alone. Hi sis. Meghan: Hi. Brian: Oh shit! Peg: Brian, watch your mouth. Meghan: Is Shannon coming for Christmas this year? Peg: No, but she sent us a Christmas card from Seattle. A new boyfriend, job at a coffee shop. Brian: Good God, is she going to be the hornery teenager forever? Peg: Brian she's had a hard time. Brian: Oh come on Mom. You've given that kid everything she ever wanted. Meghan: Oh, saw your Law and Order episode last week. It was great. Seamus: You made a spectacular corpse. Brian: Thanks Dad. Seamus: Is it in the shed? Peg: Did you say hello to your daughter? Seamus: Hello daughter. Meghan: Now what's that all about? Peg: Oh! Here they are! Meghan: What? Peg: Oh! It's so good to see you! Sean: This place! Mom! Meg! Peg: Oh hi! My little angels! Brian: Good to see you man. Sean: How long have you been here? Brian: Too long. Jeanne: Hey, the place is so interesting. Sean: Are you okay? Really? Meghan: Yeah. [screaming] Jeanne: How are you? [everyone talking at once] Seamus: It's not in the shed. Sean: Hey Dad. What's going on? Seamus: Women and holidays. I'd rather be working. Jackie: Hi Grandpa. Seamus: Jackie! Brian: I know. It's called halitosis and he was supposed to talk to his doctor about it. Peg: Sean, Jeanne come on. I'll show you the house. Brian, Seamus get the rest of the bags and bring them inside. Jeanne: How are you? Meghan: Good, good. Brian: Dad, you have cat breath. Either it's something serious or that corned beef addiction of yours. Seamus: Of all people to be diagnosing me. That corned beef was reviewed by News Day's dining critic in '78. He gave it four chef's hats. Brian: Yadda, yadda, yadda. It put Fitzgerald's Pub on the map, but whoever heard of a phony Irish bar serving good food? Seamus: That phony Irish bar allowed you to spend seven years in drama school so you could be a waiter at Howard Johnson. Besides the Irish are great cooks. Brian: Yeah? Name me one great Irish chef. Seamus: I said cooks, real food. Not that namby pamby crap they serve today. Would you believe that last week at the Knights of Columbus luncheon they served us a salad with flowers in it? Brian: You still haven't named me one great Irish chef. Seamus: Seamus and Peg Fitzgerald. There's two. Brian: When your family has been in America for over a century you don't count. Seamus: I'm as Irish as the next - Brian: The next third generation American. Peg: Sean and Jeanne said the living room is very modern. Isn't that a nice thing to say? Seamus: What a waste of money that room was. Jeanne: Four bedrooms? Peg, why so big? Peg: I intended to have room for all the grandchildren I was supposed to have. Brian: One down three to go Mom. Jeanne: I've already made my contribution to the grandchild fund. Peg: Two children is not a family Jeanne. It's just a start, and you're so young. You have perfect hips for child bearing dear. Sean: We're happy with just two Mom. Besides I don't want to be coaching baseball when I'm 60. Peg: 60 my backside. Seamus: Tony Randall fathered children at 77 and 79. Anthony Quinn was 80. Peg: Well I had Shannon when I was 42. Sean: Exactly. Peg: Sean, I don't understand you. First she doesn't take your name and now you're only having two children? Sean: Mother! Brian: Yeah, what kind of man are you anyway. You know, I expect more from my brother. Peg: Probably using birth control too. God forgive them. Jeanne: Why couldn't they retire to Florida like normal people. Jackie: This is a disaster. Sean: Mom, you didn't? Seamus: Indeed she did. Peg: I have been saying for years that all this family does when we get together is watch sports on TV. So I've done it. The TV is gone. This year we are going to behave like a family. Brian: You know we could go to McGillicutty's and watch the game. Seamus: Ah she'd find us though. She's like God almighty; she knows everything. Peg: Meghan, get me the milk. I need it for the potatoes. Jeanne: Peg, why don't you let us buy you an electric mixer? Peg: Nonsense, I do it with love. They taste better that way. I saw that. If you'd just watch me maybe you'd hold on to David. Jeanne: How late do you think Kate is going to be? Peg: Oh, you know Kate she'll be along. Besides this is just a little something I've whipped up at the last minute. Sean: Oh mom you threw that together? Jeanne usually throws together macaroni and cheese. When I come home late from the hospital and I don't call to tell her I'll be late, causing the filet mignon she was going to serve to become overcooked and in a desparate attempt to feed her family she whips together a little macaroni - I'm just going to stop now. Jeanne: Nice try. Peg: Come on now Jeanne, you can do better than that. Only two children, both of them in school. It's time you started cooking again. Well, maybe you should take lessons first. Meghan: Uh, Mom, Kate, how's she doing? Seamus: I never thought I'd live to see the day a daughter of mine worked for the Alliance of Liberal Political Organization. Brian: The Fitzgeralds have produced a liberal democrat. Who'd have thunk it? Seamus: Kennedy was a great man, democrats were a great party until they nominated that peanut farmer, whatever his name was. I can't remember names anymore. The one that told Playboy about lust in his heart. Sean: Jimmy Carter. Dad, how do you know what he said in Playboy? Brian: Come on Dad. Seamus: In the closet! Is the TV in the closet? Peg: So, Kate is bringing home her latest boyfriend. Oh, pardon me she says her significant other. Brian: For a feminist she sure keeps company with a lot of men. Peg: I know what you're implying Brian Fitzgerald and you will be civil in my home. You left a bit of skin on these dear. She better not think that she'll be sharing her room with this boyfriend under my roof. Seamus: Not in the closet. Peg: And he's also a bigshot with the ACLU, and he's divorced, but we'll talk to Father Michael about an anullment if it comes to that. But what's his name? I keep getting all her boyfriend's names confused. [rustling paper] Scott Flynn. She's finally dating a nice Catholic boy. All together: Amen. [humming] Brian: This is unbelievable. He's eating even more now. Sean: Dad, your doctor wants you to watch your cholesterol. Seamus: I am watching. I'm 65 years old and I'm damned if I'll change the way I eat at this stage in my life. Peg: You're 64. Seamus: You see a story on the news about some such or another that's good for you and then the next day they're telling you it causes cancer of the whoseit. Brian: And the whoseit would be where? Seamus: I'll eat what I will. Brian: Mom, I can't believe you're going to let him eat like that. He's going to have a heart attack right here at the table. Peg: Well it's not healthy to be a vegetarian either. Brian: Actually, it's very healthy. You see animals - Seamus: Are delicious. I love them. Meghan: Sean, you do know the Heimlich maneuver right? [pager beeping] Jeanne: You planned that. Sean: I did not. It's the hospital. Seamus: I'm thinking about planting a sycamore out back, maybe a larch, but I don't know if a larch grows around here. It's from someplace out west. Sean: No, that's okay Dan we were just fighting our way through dinner. Peg: You're father's taken an interest in horticulture. Sean: Really? Could you stabilize her? I'll be right there. Jeanne: I know you, you gotta go. You going to be all right? Sean: It's one of our patients in trouble. Dan asked me - Jeanne: That's not what I asked. Sean: Bye honey. Jackie: Bye. Sean: Bye sweetie. Sarah: I need to talk to you Daddy. Sean: We'll talk as soon as I get home. Okay? Peg: But Sean! Seamus: It's the corporal work of mercy Peg. Leave the boy alone. Peg: That would drive me crazy Jeanne. He's very thin. He looks so tired. Are you feeding him well or do you still order out too often. Jeanne: He's been working very hard lately. Katie: I saw Sean leaving. Did you drive him crazy already Ma? Oh! That tree is fake, it's too small and it's leaning. Peg: Not in the house. Katie: Wait, I need a TV. I gotta see something on CSPAN. Scott: Ah, well Kate wanted me to tell you that I'm Scott, Scott Flynn. Uh, hi. How are you doing? Jeanne: Hi, I'm Jeanne. Scott: Hi Jeanne. Nice to meet you. Seamus: Hi Scott. Meghan: Meghan. Scott: Pleasure. Brian: Brian. Scott: Brian, hi. Peg: Peg. Scott: Peg, nice to meet you too. Wow this is great. Katie: Okay, I give up. Hi Dad. What room's the TV in in here? Oh, did a FedEx package come for me? Wait, there is only one room in this house. How can you stand it? Scott: Kate, come on. You don't have to watch the Congressional Woman's Caucus Hour every week. Kate: Okay, I give up. Where's the TV? Peg: You've had three FedExes since noon and there's no TV in the house. Katie: What? What do you mean no TV? How are we going to spend the entire weekend together with no TV? Meghan: We're going to talk. Seamus: Here you go son. Scott: Thank you. Seamus: Scott, where are you from? Scott: Oregon. Seamus: Oregon? What's the capital of Oregon? Peg: What part of Ireland do your relatives come from? North or south? Scott: Excuse me? Katie: In her own perverted way my mother's trying to ask whether your Catholic or Protestant. Scott: Oh, actually my mother's Jewish and my father's Catholic. Well they decided they'd let me pick what religion I wanted to be when I grew up. So, I decided to be an atheist. Seamus: What about larch? They got larch in Oregon? Scott: Larch? Brian: Gee, I wonder what's on cable. Scott: I'm a satellite man myself, 300 channels, nothing on. [laughing] Katie: I only watch CSPAN. Brian: Kate, grow a life. Peg: Let's play Scruples. Brian: We can't play Scruples, they're lawyers. Scott: Oh ho ho! Seamus: I hate that game. Your mother always wins. Brian, did you bring your ears? Brian: You mean my Walkman? Seamus: Yeah, give me your Walkman. Seamus: I can certainly listen to people talk about my game if I can't see it in all its technicolor glory. Peg: Everyone else in? Everyone: Yes. Katie: I'm always blue. Politics and history. Brian: Politics and history is orange in this set, and Agent Scully could you possibly spend a weekend without your cell phone attached to your ear? Katie: No and science is orange. Brian: No, we're playing with a different set of cards. Politics and history is orange. Katie: Fine. Read it. Brian: Name the town in Massachusetts which was thrice attacked by Indians in King Phillips' War. Katie: Springfield. Scott: No, it couldn't have been Springfield it's too big. Katie: It wasn't too big in the 1600s. Scott: Fine. Katie: Springfield. Brian: Hatfield. Mom, Meghan your turn. Katie: No way. Scott: Good one. You're good at this aren't you? Peg: Oh dear, literature. Meghan, that's one for a teacher. Meghan: Mom, they don't teach literature in kindergarten. Scott: Oh, this is an easy one. Uh, what classic of Indian dramatic literature was presumably written in the 2nd century BC? Meghan: No clue. Gone With the Wind? Scott: That is incorrect. The correct answer is the Nia - Brian: Nitya Stotra. All righty, entertainment. Scott: Impressive. Meghan: Okay, what famous musical features the song There's no Business Like Show Business? Seamus: Annie Get Your Gun. Everyone: Dad! Seamus: Back then they really had singers on Broadway, Ethel Merman. They didn't even need microphones. Brian: Dad, that's because they didn't have amplified instruments in the pit back then. If Ethel Merman were on stage today - Scott: She'd look awful. Brian: Even she would need a microphone. Scott: How do you know this stuff? Brian: I'm working on Broadway. Scott: Really? That is so - Katie: Howard Johnson's, corner of 46th and Broadway. [phone ringing] He's a waiter. Scott: Interesting. Jeanne: I'll get it. Brian: I'm an actor. Things have been a little dry lately. Jeanne: Hello? Hello? No I haven't lost my mind yet. Give them some time. They're already asleep. Okay. Well, then I'll see you when I see you I guess. All right, I love you too. Bye. He won't be home until late tonight. Peg: Must be hard on you. Jeanne: I knew what I was getting into when I married a doctor. Peg: And Lord did you want to marry a doctor. Jeanne: Excuse me? Peg: I'll never forget that day that Sean called up and said he met this girl in the hospital. He was a fourth year resident and you were a teenage candy striper. What were you 16? Jeanne: 20 and I was a nurse's aide trying to meet my tuition bill, not a doctor. Brian: Jeanne met Sean one day when she was carrying a tray into a patient's room and she spilled the tray all over Sean. [laughing] Peg: Remember that wine you spilled all over Uncle Kevin last Easter? Jeanne: Oh God. [laughing] Brian: Anyway, it may not be the most romantic tale ever told, but it sure beats barhopping at the local Hooters. Scott: Well Hooters ain't so - It's a horrible sexist place. Jeanne: Anyway we're married, next question. Katie: Yeah, but you should have heard it when Sean called and said that he'd asked you to marry him. Mom thought you were knocked up. Peg: I thought no such thing. Katie: Oh yes you did. Peg: Well, we were all very relieved when you weren't. Although I'd have another grandchild then wouldn't I? Brian: Allrighty then entertainment, again. Scott: Okay, what song does this lyric come from, We Don't Need - Seamus: The Wall. Is the TV hidden in the the wall closet by the bathroom? Katie: That counts. Jeanne: That does not count. Katie: Yes, it does. Brian: Then we get a - Peg: The Wall - [everyone talking] Peg: Meghan and Kate will sleep in the first bedroom on the left. Katie: Mom, Scott and I are going to share a room. Peg: Not under my roof. Brian: Fornication, F-O-R-N-I-C-A-T-I-O-N, fornication. Katie: Mother this is ridiculous. Scott: That's fine Mrs. Fitzgerald. Peg: And Brian and Scott will sleep in the first room on the right. Now, there's a little sky light in there and it may wake you up a little bit early in the morning, but it's right next to the master bedroom. Brian: Oh God, not next to you. Seamus: Wear your earplugs. Brian: My earplugs only reduce sound up to 30 decibels, and when you're sleeping next to the Concord that ain't much. Peg: Your father doesn't snore. Seamus: He was speaking of you Peg. Peg: I don't snore. Seamus: Darlin' the sound coming out of your nose would tumble the Great Wall of China. [doorbell] Peg: Now who could that be? It's almost 11:00. David! We've been waiting for you. Hey! David! Seamus: Can I get you a sandwich? Brian: Can I fix you a drink? Meghan: So glad you came. David: Yeah. Peg: Oh, oh dear. Now we'll have to redo the sleeping arrangements again. David: No, no. Don't change anything on my account. I'll sleep on the couch. Peg: Oh fine. I'll just go get you some blankets. Jeanne: Yeah, well I think I'm going to hit the sack too. Katie: Night. Meghan: Night. Katie: Scott. Scott! Scott: Huh? Oh. Good night. Meghan: Night. Thanks. Peg: Good night. David: Night. Meghan: Night Mom. Meghan: David, I'm really glad you came. I hope - David: Meghan stop. I don't want to talk now. I need to figure out whether I want to stay at all. Meghan: Oh. Okay. Um, I guess good night then. David: Good night. Katie: I hate this house. I don't know why they couldn't have just stayed in the old one. They only moved ten minutes away. Meghan: They bought this house so Dad wouldn't have to go up and down the stairs. He refuses to have that hip replacement. You know that so stop being a smartass. Katie: My, my you and David must be having the troubles. Meghan: Yeah. Katie: Well come on. You can't just leave me in suspense. Meghan: Yeah, I can. Katie: Even after you stole him from me? Meghan: You know, you went out with him twice in high school for pete's sake, Kate. Katie: Well, looks like he should have stuck with me. Meghan: Oh! That's it! I'm sick of you already. I'm going to go sleep in Brian's room. Katie: You can come out now. Just make sure you're out of here before my mother wakes up and checks in on me. Scott: Why bother, Kate. I'm sure she knows. Kate: My mother and the Spanish Inquisition have a lot in common. Now go to sleep. Scott: Sleep tight dear. Seamus: That's my boy. I always loved you more than the others. Sean: I took it from the doctor's lounge. Seamus: Put it over there in the basement. I'll hide it with my tools. Your mother will never see it. Sean: Dad, what are you eating at 4:00 in the morning? Seamus: Swedish meatballs. You want some? Sean: Sure, why not? How old are these meatballs? Seamus: Not old at all. They're left over from Thanksgiving at Uncle Kevin's. Sean: You must have a cast iron stomach. Seamus: Here, I made the corned beef yesterday. So how's your patient? Sean: Not well. Dad, what would you say if I told you I was thinking about leaving my practice and going into research? Seamus: Why would you do that? Sean: My psychiatrist would say that I'm joining the ranks of the burned out pediatric oncologists. Seamus: Your psychiatrist? Sean: Yeah. Seamus: You knew when you specialized you were getting into a tough field. Sean: Yeah, well I was an idealist then. Somewhere along the line I lost my God complex. Seamus: I wanted you to be a plastic surgeon to the stars myself. Actually, you're my first born son. I wanted you to be a priest. Sean: I'm asking your advice here. Seamus: Sean, I don't have any advice to give you. I own a pub. You're a doctor, you save lives. You make a damn good living for your family. Goodnight son. Jackie: What are those? Is that candy? Kate: Yeah, you could call it that. Jeanne: Why don't you go find your father okay? Go. Kate, if you ever show those to my daughter again I'll tell your mother. Jackie: Dad, wake up, wake up. Mom said you'd take me to get my ears pierced today. She said it was a Christmas gift. Really. Sean: Honey. Jackie: Yeah? Sean: I'm tired. Not stupid. Jackie: But Dad. Peg: Have you fed them breakfast yet? Sean: No Mom I'm just getting up. Peg: Oh goodness Sean. It's almost 9:00. They're growing children they need their breakfast. What is Jeanne thinking? Brian: Yeah Sean whatever is the matter with your wife? Breakfast at 8:00 am. Oh, by the way Dad told me about the the TV in the basement. I have never been so proud to have you as a brother. Good guy. Sean: I'm going to take a shower now. Jackie: Hey, Uncle Brian will you take me to the mall to get my ears pierced? Sean: Jackie I heard that! Brian: [laughing] [doorbell] Brian: Oh, thanks. Shannon: I split up with my boyfriend. I left Seattle and I thought I'd come see the new house and I was wondering if it'd be okay if I came home to stay this time and this house is interesting. Peg: Of course you can dear. I've been so worried about you. Sean: Here we go again. Brian: Merry Christmas everybody. What Shannon, your new boyfriend throw you out? Peg: Quiet Brian. Shannon, come have breakfast. Brian: So Kate how are things over at Alpo? Paying for the defenses of any husband killers lately? Spending any more of our valuable tax dollars on issues of earth shattering importance like transexual prostitution in Singapore? Kate: It's not called Alpo Brian and transexual prostitution - Peg: Is not a topic for conversation at my breakfast table. Now, let's talk about something pleasant. Seamus: All these atheists in Oregon, Scott, where do they live? Peg: Oh, for pete's sake. Scott: Actually my mom and stepdad moved us up to a commune in Oregon when I was just a teenager. Peg: Oh, you're from a broken home? Kate: Mom, mind your own business. Meghan: Can we change the subject please? Scott: A broken Winnebago is more like it. They were all hippies before it was popular. Seamus, could you pass the eggs please? Peg: So, do you think your parents divorce had anything to do with the breakup of your first marriage? Scott: No, I think it was my wife's girlfriend that caused my first marriage to be unsuccesful. My second marriage, however - Peg: [coughing] Sean: Hey mouse what's up? What's wrong? Sarah: Well, at home the other day Jackie told me that - Kurt: Shannon! Sean: You know what I already made my contribution to the Save the MTV Generation. Thanks anyway. Shannon, I think that's for you. [knocking] Kurt: Shannon! Sean: Listen - Sarah: I know, I know why don't I go and play. Shannon: Stop shaking your head at me. You're not my father. Brian: Oh no. Not him. Sean: Who is this guy? Should we know him? Brian: Remember when Shannon had that pregnancy scare? Right before she took off for the second time? Sean: How could I forget? Mom lit enough candles to burn the church down. Brian: Yeah, and remember the weird neighbors, the Zanders, the freaks next door who put up so many Christmas decorations that people still drive over just to make fun of them. Sean: Mrs. Zander, the woman who used to come to the door in her lingerie when we had the paper route. Brian: Oh, yeah. Remember that? Anyway, he is their son. Kurt: I never wanted to break up. I'm so glad you came home. Shannon: I didn't come home to be with you Kurt. Kurt: Then why'd you come home? Shannon: Look, it's complicated. Kurt: What do you mean it's complicated? I haven't seen you in months. You took off without saying goodbye or anything. Shannon: Look, I just came home. I just walked in the door, my family is all there. Kurt: You've just got to give me a few minutes. Shannon: I don't know. Meghan: David, we have to talk. David: I'm all ears. Meghan: I don't know what more I can say other than it was a mistake, and I'm sorry. And I really want us to work things out because I still love you. David: Well, then all our problems are solved. Do you think it's that simple? Meghan: I didn't say that I thought it was that simple. David: Meghan, you had an affair. You broke my heart, all the usual cliches apply. Meghan: And I don't know what I can do to make us work again. David: Neither do I. Meghan: Do you even want to try? David: I thought I did. Meghan: Then why did you come here? To embarass me in front of my whole family? So that all my brothers and sisters could have their say on the sorry state of our marriage, or was it just because I asked? David: Yes, Meghan it was. Hard as that is for you to believe, I came because you called and asked me to. Maybe someday I'll learn to stop jumping when you say jump, but it's a hard habit to break. For one of us anyway. Meghan: That is not fair. David: [sighs] Meghan: Great. The silent treatment again. You know, if you weren't so - Gosh darn insular I never would have looked at somebody else in the first place. David: Is that why you cheated? Because I'm quiet? Meghan: Quiet? David it's got nothing to do with quiet. It's the way you act like everything bad that's ever happened to us is my fault. David: Oh, I can't believe that you're finding a way to blame your sleeping with another man on me. Meghan: I am not blaming you Dave, I'm - David: If things were so bad in our marriage why didn't you just - Meghan: Talk to you? David: Right. Meghan: You mean like we're doing now? David, you wouldn't even listen to me. Until the night that I told you about that stupid irresponsible fling that I had and it didn't last anyway. David: It did't last? Well for God's sakes Meghan. You told me it lasted for three months, or do you want to revise that now too? It wasn't just a fling. It was a lot more than that. [sad music] Jeanne: Oh please Kate, everybody knows how you cook pasta. Water, boil, add pasta. What do you make for dinner when you're home alone? Kate: Reservations. Kurt: Don't you remember? We were going to open up an aroma therapy supply store in Massapequa? Shannon: I wanted to go to Sri Lanka and work with the Dalai Lama. Kurt: But the Dalai Lama is in Bangladesh. Kate: India. Kurt: No the Dalai lives in Bangladesh. Peg: Meghan, I saw you talking to David. How'd it go? Sean: Oh! Sorry, sorry, sorry. Scott: You're the doctor? I need a drink. Sean: Hey! That's Sarah's Barbie dream house. Scott: Nothing like an ultra sissy toy under the Christmas tree to warm the cockles of your heart. Brian: He cheated on her. That's why they're separated. Yeah, David cheated on Meghan. Sean: That's too bad. Brian: Don't you want to do something? Don't you want to talk to him? Sean: No. Seamus: Brian, it's your sister's business, not yours and certainly not ours. Brian: But she's our sister. Seamus: Brian, trust us. We're married men. We've learned our lesson. Mind your own business. Brian: Why are you all so calm? Have you ever? Sean: No. Brian: You didn't know what I was going to ask. Sean: [laughing] Oh yes I did. Seamus: No. Halftime. Scott: May I? Brian: What about you? Scott: What about me what? Brian: Have you ever had an affair? Kurt: Huh? I'm not married. Brian: Not you Einstein. Kurt: Kurt. I changed my name from Howard after Kurt Cobain died. Kind of a tribute. Brian: I know your name Howie. I used to smash your pumpkins every Halloween. I was talking to Scott. Scott: Well, now that you mention it. That's why marriage number two fell apart. Seamus: And to think I liked you. Here. Kurt: All right. How come the Beverly Hillbillies is on PBS? Brian: That's the Grapes of Wrath Kissinger. Kurt: Kurt. Sean: Dr. Fitzgerald. I just received a page. Hi Rick. Damn. I'm leaving now. I'll be there in maybe half an hour. Yeah. Sorry it's one of my patients there. Jeanne: Go. [kiss] Sean: I'll be fine. Jeanne: Sean. Sean: I said I'm fine. Jeanne: No you're not fine. Did you get a chance to talk to Sarah? Sean: When have I had time to talk to Sarah? Jeanne: Great. Sean: Honey, we can't have this discussion now. I've got to get to the hospital. There's no time for this. Jeanne: There's no time to talk to your own daughter? Sean: What about that little girl at the hospital? Jeanne: Okay. What do I say to that? [door slams] [phone ringing] Sean: Fitzgerald. Oh no. Yeah, I'm still here. Right. See you Monday. Kate: Like all these stay at home mothers? Look at Jeanne. All these soccer moms just do not get it. Where are they going to be when their husbands leave them for some trophy wife and they've got to get back into the job market? Jeanne: Where did you get all this garbage you're filling your brain with? Peg: You need to use more frosting dear. In my day the mothers didn't have any choice but to stay home. Jeanne: Actually, I'm going back to teaching next year. Peg: And our children benefitted from it. Jeanne is doing the right thing staying at home, at least until her girls are in high school. What was that you said dear? Jeanne: Nothing. Peg: But I hardly think you can describe Jeanne as conservative. Kate: She's a hell of a lot closer to Betty Crocker than Betty Friedan. Peg: Betty Crocker? I don't think so dear. Really now? She didn't even take her husband's name. Jeanne: Peg, I did take Sean's name. I'm Jeanne Quinn-Fitzgerald. Peg: That's hardly taking his name dear. Kate: And hardly keeping your own. Jeanne: I hate these conversations. Kate: And when 50% of all marriages end in divorce, keeping your own identity is so important. I mean look at Meghan. What is Meghan going to do? She's a kindergarten teacher for God's sake. That's hardly a career. Jeanne: Who says it isn't? Kate: And now she's splitting up with her husband. Or Shannon. Now there's a case. She didn't even finish high school. What is she going to do? And what are you going to do with her Mom? Are you just going to take care of her forever? Jeanne: What about you? Kate: What about me? Jeanne: Well you've deconstructed everybody else in the family. Now, let's psychoanalyize you. What's the deal with Scott? Meghan: Yeah, what ist he deal with Scott? Peg: Yes Kate. I really do feel I must speak to you about Scott. Kate: I know. I know Mom. I know. He's a twice divorced atheist and so we should all just shun him or rend our clothes or whatever the Catholic equivalent of that is. Peg: I'm very hurt by that Kate. I only have your best interests at heart. Kate: Oh boy. Here we go. Peg: He is a divorced man who doesn't believe in God. Kate: You know it's amazing how quickly the conversation turns to religion around here. Peg: And why shouldn't we? God sees everything Kate. Kate: You know I don't mind if God sees, Mom. It's you that I mind. See God doesn't give me that, "How could you possibly I'm so disappointed in you," eyes welling up with tears lower lip quivering thing that you do so well. Peg: I'm sorry if it offends you Katherine Mary. But I raised my children to believe in everything that you have seen fit to spend your entire personal and professional life trying to degrade. Kate: Oh come on, give me one example. Peg: Eighth grade graduation from Saint Killian's. You were the valedictorian. Your entire speech implored the church to rethink its views about the all-male priesthood. Kate: Well it should. Peg: High school prom. You organized a sit in against Sacred Heart's refusal to allow condoms in the nurse's office. I was not pleased to have to go down to the Westbury Holiday Inn to negotiate with you about the hostile takeover of room 124. Kate: Mom, that really didn't have anything to do with condoms. Peg: Law school graduation. Again, you were the valedictorian. You spent your entire speech berating the university trustees about their record of investing in South Africa. Kate: And they divested the very next week. Peg: Sometimes I have felt like Jane Fonda's mother. And yes, yes it does hurt me. And yes, I am disapointed, but not in you. In your choices. Kate: Oh come on. You're just angry I don't go to church anymore, and don't worry. I'm going to mass with you tonight. Peg: Oh, don't do me any favors. Kate: You know I have never done anything that I regret. Jeanne: Not even throwing your bra on stage at that Bee Gees concert back in 1976? Kate: What? Who told you that? That never happened. There was no bra. It was a bikini top. Jeanne: Oh! Boy do you belong in politics. [phone ringing] Meghan: Oh come on. Everybody knows about that. [phone ringing] Jeanne: Hello? Oh Dr. Reid. No, I thought he was at the hospital. Peg: Meghan, you should have a baby. That way you'd hold onto David. Meghan: I don't think so Mom. Jeanne: I'll be back in a while. Somebody watch my kids. Peg: But Christmas Eve dinner. Jeanne: I'll be back. Meghan I'm taking your car. Meghan: Okay. Peg: What has gotten into these people? Kurt: Can I ask you another question? Scott: Mm-hmm. Kurt: You're a lawyer right? Scott: Well, I have a law degree. I don't practice law. Kurt: Well, that's cool. What I want to ask is, you know mattress tags? Scott: Mattress tags? Kurt: Yeah. If I pull off one of those mattress tags, am I breaking the law or something? Scott: Yes, Kurt. In fact, it's a violation of US Code, Section 1234, the Posturepedic Protection Act of 1954. Justice Department takes it very seriously. It's a felony. Kurt: Oh man! I'm a felonist. Scott: Your secret's safe with me. Seamus: Ah cheese and crackers. Brian, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's been a long time since you brought a girl around here. Brian: Dad, the last time I brought a girl home Mom kept questioning her about whether she wanted to have a big family or not. Seamus: That's a fair question. Brian: We'd only been dating three weeks. David: What's the score? Scott: 34-10, Alabama. David: Need any help? Seamus: Nope, we're doing just fine here. Thanks. David: Ah. [can opening] Scott: So, you used to date Kate? David: I went out with Kate a couple of times in high school. We broke up when I asked her if we could go steady. Scott: Mm. David: She said she'd never belong to any man. Scott: [laughing] Yep, that's my Kate. Davd: Mm-hmm, but don't let her hear you say that. Scott: No, no, no. [laughing] Funny, I can't picture you and Kate together, even in high school. David: Me neither. [laughing] Scott: Come to think of it, sometimes I can't picture me and Kate together. You know what I mean? David: Yeah, I think we all know what you mean. Scott: But I love her. So, any tips about this family you'd care to share with me? David: Run like hell. Scott: No, I mean it. David: [laughing] So do I. Scott, you can't marry into this family. You have to be born into it, otherwise just hang on tight, keep your arms and legs inside the car. Don't ask me. I'm just passing through. [birds] Jeanne: Hi stranger. Sean: Hi. Jeanne: I thought I'd find you here. Sean: She was only 7 years old. Jeanne: I know. Dr. Ried called looking for you. Sean: Go ahead and say it. Jeanne: Whoever you are and whatever your plan is, I want to know where you're hiding my husband. Sean: Jeanne. Jeanne: He looks a lot like you, only he smiles more and he likes his work, and he's not distant and distracted around his family. Sean: Guilty as charged. Is this what a midlife crisis feels like? Jeanne: I wouldn't know. I'm not there quite yet. You're scaring me, Sean. Sean: I can't do this anymore Jeanne. I go to the hospital and I dread being there because every parent that I look at could be us and every child that I look at could be ours. And I give them my standard speech about the great advances we've made in treating childhood cancer and how so many of them will go on to lead normal lives when I know that too many of them won't because none of our advances are enough. Then I go to the office and I fight with an HMO who won't allow bone marrow transplant because they've decided that anything more complex than a drive thru tonsillectomy is an experimental procedure, when I know and they know that an experimental procedure is the best chance that some of these kids are going to get. And then I dread going home because everyone there knows that Daddy's in a bad mood again and that he treats his patients better than he does his family. And I tell myself I'll be a better father and a better husband and then I wake up the next day and nothing's changed. I'm still, at best, a halfway decent husband and a sometimes attentive father. I still have patients dying on Christmas Eve, and I don't know how to change it. I got into medicine to change it. Jeanne: Always the idealist. I love you for that you know? Sean: If I leave my practice our lifestyle is going to have to change, drastically. Jeanne: Well if my options are a smaller house, or an unhappy husband I'll take the smaller house. Sean: In Rochester, Minnesota? I don't now. It sounds like Pennsyltucky to me. Jeanne: Sean, anything west of Hackensack sounds like Pennsyltucky to me. Sean: The clinic wants an answer on Monday. I'm going to have to think some more about this. Jeanne: All right. Hey, do me a favor and think at home. You're mother will have my head on a platter if we're not back by supper. Sean: Marry me again? Jeanne: Anytime. [kiss] Kurt: Hey. Shannon: Kurt, what do you want? Kurt: Marry me? Shannon: For the third time, no. Kurt: Well, what are you going to do? Shannon: I have no idea. Get a job at McDonalds or something. Kurt: That's cool. What about me? Shannon: Kurt, just go back to whatever it was you were doing. Kurt: I can get a job you know. I can support you. I can get a job at Dairy Queen and we can buy a house or something. Shannon: I want to know how to support myself. Maybe then my brothers and sisters won't treat me like dirt. Kurt: Maybe they treat you like dirt because you don't respect them very much. Shannon: What would you know about it? I know we're not back together. Kurt: Well then can I just kind of like hang out here, like Darlene's ex-boyfriend did on Rosanne? Peg: Meghan, that's now how you make gravy. Meghan: No Mom that's not how you make gravy. It's how I make gravy. Don't worry about it. Brian: No Kate I'm telling you you're wrong. Kate: I am not wrong. Seamus: Where's the salt? Peg: Seamus, it's on the second shelf where it's been since we moved in. Seamus: No, it isn't. Kate: Do you make this stuff up? Kurt: So, everybody - Everybody! I was wondering if it'd be okay if I kind of stayed here a while even though Shannon and I aren't like together or anything. Kates: You're nuts. You're dreaming. Peg: Somebody take the dessert out of the freezer. And have it defrost. Where's David: Meghan: I don't know Mom, around I think. Mom, knock it off! Brian: I'm telling you Kate two of them were not mentioned in the song. Sean: I can't stand this right now. I'm going to call the hospital. Jeanne: I'll go check on the girls. Seamus: Where's the salt? Peg: Seamus Fitzgerald, look for it. Don't just stand there asking me. Brian: The Professor and Maryanne must have had really bad agents. Kate: Well at least they had agents Brian. All together: Amen. Peg: I'm sorry we have to rush dinner, but we have to be at church at 8:00. Brian: Mom, I know midnight mass is crowded, but don't you think leaving four hours early is a bit extreme? Jeanne: It's at 8:00? Seamus: Houliganism. They had a problem last year at midnight mass with houligans. It was the choir. Peg: Seamus it was not funny. Seamus: They had a Christmas party before mass, came in drunk and sang Grandma got run over by a reindeer for the processional. [laughing] Father Michael was very displeased and he moved midnight mass to 8:00. Peg: It was sacrilegious. Seamus: Too many Italians in the choir. Christmas Eve is a big thing for them you know. Brian: What does being Italian have to do with it? Peg: So, will you be going to midnight mass with us Scott? Kate: Of course. Scott: I don't think so. Kate: Yes Scott, you will. Scott: Hey, why would I be going to mass? Kate: Because it's Christmas. Scott: Kate, Christmas to me is an afternoon at the multiplex and dinner at Szechuan Kitchen. Kate: Welcome to the family. You're going to church. Scott: And why are you going? You're a pro birth control, pro abortion, pro assisted suicide, anti tuition tax credit anti marriage liberal who's living with a divorced atheist. Seamus: You're living in sin? Brian: Oh, couldn't be. She's Irish. Seamus: That's true. Brian: It is not true. We are not Irish, we just pretend. Shannon: [laughing] Sean: Shannon cut it out. Shannon: Cut out what? You're looking a little worn out there doc. Is being the best loved, first born son getting to you? Sean: You know since we're talking about living in sin dad, look no further than your darling Shannon. She sleeps with Freud thinks she's pregnant and she runs off to God knows where only pop up again here on Christmas Eve with - Brian: Einstein, Churchill, Thomas Edison. Sean: Thomas Edison in tow. Kurt: Kurt. Shannon: You're not my father Sean. He is. And don't make fun of Kurt. Sean: I'm not talking about Kurt Shannon. I'm talking about you. While we're on the subject, what would possess someone to change their name to honor a drug addled rock star who blew his own brains out? Kurt: He was my generation's martyred saint. Shannon: You're just jealous. Sean: Of what? Brian: I just love Christmas with the family. Pacem in terris. Jeanne: Brian, you live for this. You've always been the instigator. Brian: Well excuse me miss perfect hyphenated homemaker. Jeanne: You think my life is perfect? My brain is turning to mush while my husband works an 18-hour day, six days a week, and I sit at PTA meetings trying to make decisions like whether or not we should have a bake sale or a poinsettia sale. [talking over Sean] Or whether or not we should paint the cafeteria teal or maroon. That's the perfect life? Brian: Okay, don't talk to me. Not after what you did to my sister. David: Who me? Brian: Yes you. Scott: I thought you said you had to be born into this? Brian: And you who admit to your girlfriend's father and brothers that you cheated on your second wife. You had an affair with some tramp yourself. Kate: Hey, that tramp you're talking about is me. David: You think that I cheated on her? Did you tell them that I had an affair? Meghan: I didn't tell them anything. I didn't tell them that I couldn't have children and he wouldn't even talk to me about it when all I really needed was your shoulder to cry on. And I sure as hell did not tell anybody that anybody had an affair. It's true. Only, I'm the one that had the affair Brian. Not David. It was me. Seamus: Would you please pass the gravy? Peg: Nobody is passing any gravy. I don't want to know what commandments you've broken this week. And I don't want to hear anymore about which of the seven deadlies you've committed lately. And I don't want to hear anymore about this ugly house that we've moved into because we're getting older and it's not so easy to move around. Because we both know that the next step is one of those horrid little retirement communities in Florida where every pharmacy sells more adult diapers than baby diapers and there's a Pancake House on every corner serving earlybird dinners until 6:00. So, while I can I am trying my best to give you a pleasant Christmas, which isn't as easy as it used to be when I was younger and I had more energy. So I want you all to calm down, to shut up and to eat the gosh damn Christmas Eve dinner I've worked so hard on. Now then. What did you think of that breakin at the US Embassy in Manila last week Scott? Scott: It was terrible. Peg: Yes. Scott: Terrible. Sean: Are you going to smile for me? Sarah: How will Santa know that we're here? He thinks that we're at our house. Jeanne: I told you. Santa is very smart. Brian: That's right Sarah. Santa is a Mensa member. Jeanne: Let's go get that apple. [door opens and closes] Meghan: He left. Brian: Meghan, I am so sorry. Meghan: It's all right. It's all right. You guys would have found out anyway. It'd have to come out Catholic guilt and all. Sarah: For the reindeer. Don't eat. Brian: You are just like Mom and Dad except for they had that spotlight on top of their Super8 camera. Meghan: You know, I think you have reindeer apple duty Brian. Brian: I can't believe I'm doing this. Meghan: I don't know what I'm going to do without him Brian. I always thought we'd stay together forever and have a bunch of kids, and I'd stay home like Mom. When we found out I couldn't have children, it just - Brian: Adopt. Meghan: I know, we could adopt, but do you remember Laura Daniels? Brian: Mm-hmm. Meghan: About a year ago they adopted a baby and the birth parents took them to court and they took the baby back. I just couldn't - I can't go through that. Brian: Hey, that's a risk you're going to have to take. Meghan: I know. I guess I should have thought of that before I started having - Brian: Please. You're my sister. Don't conjure up any unsavory visual images. Meghan: I guess I have to go face the music huh? Brian: Meghan. Meghan: What? Brian: Does this look like reindeer bites? Meghan: Oh my God. I think it looks pretty good. Brian: All right. Kurt: I'm not high in the mountaintop and it's not weird and boring. If you had kids would you want to take them to church? Shannon: I said no. Kurt: So, if we had kids - Shannon: We're not having kids. Peg: Seamus, get up and eat the cookies we left for Santa. Seamus: Cookies. Kurt: Just the fact that you're talking to me at least gives me hope. Shannon: I'm talking to you because there's nobody else to talk to. Jackie: Sarah, you can't go out there. Sarah: Jackie, stop it. Sean: Brian, Brian! Guard the hallway. Peg: Sean, I've been meaning to speak to you about Shannon. You must be easier on her. She didn't have all the advantages that you had. Sean: Advantages? Before Dad took over the pub I thought that spam was a food group. Peg: That's exactly what I mean. Meghan: What are you doing? Jeanne: Writing the girls their letter from Santa. Meghan: Four score and seven years ago. [laughing] Jeanne: Looking for inspiration. Meghan: I guess. Sarah: Uncle Brian. Brian: Hey, back to bed. Peg: I'm sorry honey. Everything will be all right. I promise. Meghan: What does she have up her sleeve? Sarah: Dad, I can't sleep. Sean: Try harder. Sarah: I still need to talk to you. I'm coming out there. [yelling] Jackie: You're not going to read The Night Before Christmas to us again are you? Sean: Oh, yes I am. Scott: You can't write them checks. Kate: They'll love it. Scott: Get up. Kate: What? Where are we going? Scott: The toy store's open until midnight. Come on. Kate: Oh Scott. Scott: It's Christmas dammit. [phone ringing] Whoever you are, whatever you're calling about all I have to say is, it's Christmas dammit, go home. Oh, and Merry Christmas to you too. The Secretary of State wishes you a Merry Christmas. Come on, let's go. Sean: Are you sure you won't join us? I think she's too cool for us. Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. The stockings were hung by the chimney with care in hopes that Saint Nicholaus soon would be there. The children were nestled all snug - Over to the window, I flew like a flash tore open the shutters and threw up the sash. The moon - More rapid than eagles his courses they came and he whistled and shouted and called them by name. Now Dasher, now Dancer, now Prancer and Vixen. On Comet, on Cupid. Sarah: You can stop now. She's a sleep. Sean: What's wrong princess? Sarah: You have time to talk? Sean: Yeah. I'm sorry princess it's been a busy couple of days. Sarah: Is there a Santa Claus or not? Jackie told me that there isn't. Sean: Maybe this is one for your mother. Come here. Let's see. Jeanne: Penny for your thoughts. Sean: We're so lucky. Jeanne: Yeah. Sean: Jackie told this one about - Jeanne: Oh. My sister did the same thing to me. I guess they have to grow up sooner or later. Sean: Why does it always seem like it's sooner? Pretty soon Sarah will be after us for pierced ears and saying - Sean and Jeanne: [together] Whatever! Sean: I'm going to accept that offer at the clinic. Kate: Meghan. Meghan: Hmm? Kate: I'm sorry I was rude last night. Meghan: I know. Scott was under the bed. Kate: In the closet. [laughing] Kate: Why don't you marry him? Kate: You're a funny one to be recommending marriage. Meghan: Why not? I made such a success out of it. [sighs] Look at Sean and Jeanne. Look at Mom and Dad, for that matter. Kate: I do. That's why I don't get married. Meghan: Funny. That's why I did. Kate: I said something wrong again right? Meghan: No. I'm just not tired. I think I'll - I'll go tree gaze for a little while. Kate: Meghan. Meghan: What? Kate: I'm proud of you. Meghan: Thanks. Night. Kate: Night. Peg: Hi there. Meghan: I didn't see you over there. Peg: Tissue? Meghan: No, I think I'm okay for the time being. What's the matter Mom? Peg: It used to be so simple, a bandaid, a kiss, all was better. I was good at that. But I'm not good at troubled marriages and runaways and whatever's troubling Sean. Meghan: Don't forget the lawyers and the actors Mom. Peg: Why didn't you tell us about the problems you were having? Meghan: Did you really want to know that I was having an affair, Mom? Peg: Well, maybe I could have stopped it. Meghan: [laughing] You're a crazy old woman, Mom. Do you think that David and I - Peg: Meghan, don't ask me that. Everything has changed so much. It seems the world has passed me by, and I don't know what to think anymore. Meghan: Then just tell me everything's going to be okay. Peg: Oh, that it will. Somehow. [upbeat music] Jeanne: Too early. Go back to bed. Sean: Oh honey, it's too early. Go back to bed. Jeanne: No. Sean: Uh-uh. Jeanne: No. Sean: Uh. Jeanne: Okay. You win. Jackie: Wake up Daddy. Wake up. Sean: No honey, it's too early. Go back to bed. Jeanne: No Sean. It's 6:00. We might as well get up. You girls go wake everybody else up. Jackie: Woohoo. [laughing] Sean: I was hoping that their discovery about Santa would get us a little extra sleep. Jeanne: Not a chance. Sean: [sighs] Hey, hey, look. Oh! Santa was here too. Jeanne: Thank you. [kiss] Sean: Merry Christmas. [kiss] Jeanne: Merry Christmas. Brian: I can't believe you let them wake us up at 6:00 in the morning. Sean: Here we go. Jeanne: Yep. Kurt: Spielberg. Spielberg. Spielberg. Oh. Shannon: Weirdo. Seamus: Oh. I think I'll go downstairs and look for that antique model train set. Sean: Right. [patting] Brian: Oh, you got it Dad. Scott: Maybe I can help. Excuse me darling. Kurt: Oliver Stone. Peg: Seamus Fitzgerald freeze. Do you think I don't know what's down in that basement? Seamus: But darling. Peg: Do you think that I don't know that you boys have spent a good portion of the time this weekend watching television on a television set that is supposedly hidden from me in your tool cabinet? A television set that my first born brought back with him on Friday night after his first trip to the hospital? And do you think that I don't know that it's 44-42 Bulls with two minutes to go in the second quarter? Seamus: But how did you find all that out? Peg: Seamus, darling. I know everything that goes on in these four walls. And you should go to confession Katherine Mary, but pity the poor priest who will listen to your confession. He'll have a sore bottom by the time you're done. Scott: [laughing] Kate: Yeah, what's so funny? Scott: Your family. They're just like mine. Kate: No they're not. You're family likes me just the way I am. Scott: They'd like you a lot more if you'd stay at home and have children. But we can talk about that some other time. [kiss] Peg: But you Seamus darling, are oblivious to many things that are obvious to the female eye. And Santa has brought you one present, which you haven't yet found. So, sit down. Kate: Oh no. Peg: Well, open it Seamus. Seamus: I'm afraid to darling. Peg: Nonsense dear. Open it. [paper crinkling] Seamus: All right. [everyone cheering] Now I'll be a happy man. Peg: [laughing] Seamus: But where did you hide the old set? Peg: Oh, some place I knew you would never look. It was hidden behind all the cleaning supplies. [laughing] Uncle Kevin's family where be here in an hour. Kate: Ever notice how the women spend their holidays cooking and cleaning while the men spend them in front of the TV? Jeanne: Kate, I'll let you in on a little secret. If men were in charge of the holidays we'd have our Christmas dinner of Kentucky Fried Chicken served on paper plates surrounded by dirty clothes thrown on the floor. You wouldn't want that would you? Peg: Jeanne, wine glasses go all the way to the right. These are on the left. Shannon: Sean? Sean: Yeah? Shannon: Can we talk? Sean: Yeah, sure go ahead. Shannon: No Sean. I need to have a serious talk. Sean: Oh. Okay. What's up? Shannon: Why do you hate me? [door slams] Sean: I don't hate you Shannon. I think you're irresponsible. Shannon: I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I don't know what I'm doing period. I can't stick with school, I can't stick with a job. I tell myself I can do better and I will do better, but I never do. Sean: Shannon, I apologize. Shannon: What? Sean: I'm sorry. I know I've been pretty hard on you, but I just don't think that you're being fair to Mom and Dad. You've given them a pretty hard time. First you disappear to Seattle. Then you pop back up here - Shannon: They knew where I was. Sean: You let them know that you arrived safely after you hitchhiked across country. Honestly, if one of my girls does half the things you've done, I'll be terrified. Shannon: But what do I do? Go back to school? Get a deadend job? Sean: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I've never been there. I can't tell you what to do. I can only tell you what not to do. I know I'm spouting platitudes. I'm not good at advice. I'm good at self righteousness. Shannon: Of course you are. You're a Fitzgerald. [laughing] Sean: Listen, Shannon. If you ever need Jeanne or me all you have to do is pick up the phone. You'll have to listen to me tell you everything you've done wrong, but we'll be there for you if you need us. Peg: Sean, Shannon, could you go pick up Nana? Shannon: Oh boy, has she bought a hearing aid yet? Sean: [yelling] Can't hear a thing! Shannon: [yelling] What? [laughing] Huh? Nana: Margaret, this cake is dry. Why don't you just make it from scratch? All good cooks make it from scratch. Seamus: So, when I was up at church I got an update on the annual choir Christmas party from Father Michael. Seems Dan Waznowski spent last night in jail. Scott: What can you do? The Polish have tempers. Seamus: That's what I said. But Father Michael said the folk group tried to crash the choir party, and it got a little bit out of control. Brian: I can see it now. Just like the Jets and the Sharks. Kate: You know, behavior like that is probably why you can't get a job. Peg: Okay, all right thank you. Uncle Kevin: Oh no. We didn't take pictures. [yelling] Nana: Am I seeing lightning again? [everyone talking] Nana: Oh, I hope I closed the windows. [everyone talking] Margaret, this cake is so dry. It chokes me. Brian: Nana, you want some water? Nana: Dear, you don't need to yell. I'm wearing my new hearing aid. Aunt Mary: Elizabeth Ann was dating a lovely boy until a month ago. Sean, you know any nice doctors for my daughter? Nana: Well maybe Sean could find you some nice doctors in Minnesota. He's moving there you know. He and Shannon were talking about it in the car. Sean: Well. Uh. I, um, I guess I have an announcement to make. I'm giving up my practice. [everyone yelling] I've accepted a position at researching a new therapy in childhood cancers and I've been invited to join the faculty at the medical school. Kurt: So, is that the T2 Z protocols? Sean: Yeah, it is. Kate: The what? Kurt: T2 Z is a type of drug found in the leaf of the basilicus carnate plant, or it's better known as serrata plant. That's what the natives call it. This plant has many pharmaceutical uses, but most important when they tested it on rats they found that it reduced the size of preexisting tumors. I'm over simplifying of course. Sean: That's basically right. Brian: Hey Einstein, where'd you learn that? Kurt: Scientific American. Sean: Anyway, I won't be leaving until February. Kate: I don't understand why you'd give up such a lucrative practice. You must be taking a huge paycut. Sean: Kate. One of my friends is a pediatric orthopedist. He says that the greatest joy in his life is seeing his patients grow up. I don't get a chance to do that nearly enough. So, I'm going out there to see what I can do about that. Anyway, you're all invited to Minnesota for next Christmas. Scott: Hey, I'll be there. Uncle Kevin: Since we're all making announcements, Patrick tell them. Patrick: Well, I've been in the seminary since September and I've decided to become a priest. [applause] Sean: I guess I've been upstaged. [applause] [upbeat music] Sean: Hey Brian, you need a ride? Brian: No actually my ride is on its way. Sean: You want to grab some of the stuff on the porch? Brian: Sure. Kate: No, I don't think so. I'm driving. Scott: No, you're not. I got us here. Kate: It took six hours. We stalled every four minutes. I'm driving. Scott: No you're not. Jeanne: You okay? Meghan: Yeah. Sean: You almost ready? Jeanne: Yeah, where are the girls? Sean: Sarah is in the car. Jackie is admiring her new double pierced ears. Jeanne: Her what? Sean: Shannon was just being helpful. Brian: Bye. See you brother. Jeanne: See you later. Brian: My ride is here. Peg: Bye, love you. Brian: Scott, nice to meet you man. Peg: Brian! Aren't you going to introduce us to her? Brian: What am I crazy? Peg: Well that was very rude of him not to introduce us. I'll have to talk to him. Kate: No, that was very smart. I'll have to call him. Sean: Hey, hug me. Peg: Oh! Kate: Well okay. Meghan: Bye. Sean: Call me. Meghan: I will. I'm going to follow you guys out. Sean: Don't call me please. Kate: Yeah. [everyone talking] Meghan: I'm going to follow them. Okay? Seamus: [sighs] Well that was fun. Peg: [laughing] Seamus: Now let's go watch some TV. Peg: Seamus. Seamus: Yes darling. Peg: That girl Brian was with, do you think she wants a big family? Seamus: I don't know we'll get the chance to ask. Peg: What do you mean? Kate: See? See how easy this is? Scott: Thank you I learn so much from you Kate. I love you. [music]
