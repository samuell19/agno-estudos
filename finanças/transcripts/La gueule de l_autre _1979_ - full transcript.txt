Scumbag! PERRIN FOR TOMORROW Good morning, gentlemen. If I'm too much, say so. We're not taking a group photo. Why so close? There he is. So what do we tell him? No more debates! But that's impossible, Garrivier! Can you read? A seven-point drop in the polls this morning. -So what? -I'll tell you what! It's a great representation of the CIP on TV! Let's not exaggerate, he's still very popular. No, Bertheau, people are starting to seriously wonder about him. Ah, that's lethal! And with the rumors going around… They've been going around for months. We're not dead yet. Wait for the show on Thursday! It's a front row seat to the funeral! Chin up! Keep working! Second-guessing Perrin five days before the election is total suicide. There are others. The CIP isn't just Perrin. We have all kinds of men with less questionable pasts to counter Favereau on Thursday. -Bon appétit, gentlemen. -Martial. So, you want to replace your old friend on television? -No, hear us out, Martial. -You're right, you have a nice physique. But I'm afraid you still lack a bit of authority. I wouldn't want you to fall on your face in front of millions of viewers. That would hurt me, wouldn't it, big guy? Stay on the playground a while longer, really get used to it. I'm sure you'll be on TV one day. You know, I won't be around forever. I don't want to disturb you. You must have more to discuss. I just came to pick up my mail. Chin up! You want a fight? Then, you're going to get one! The only way to avoid taking a beating on Sunday is to cut ties with Perrin. -I'll issue a press release. -Are you kidding me? -Excuse me? -Oh! Perrin is who he is, but he's the only one who measures up and you know it. -If I have one piece of advice for you-- -I don't need advice, Mr. Constant! I'm not Perrin. I don't need someone to write my speeches. Got it? We don't want to keep you, Mr. Constant. A reminder that on Thursday at 8:30 p.m. you will be able to watch the last debate of the electoral campaign. It will pit Roland Favereau, Secretary General of the Central Union, against Martial Perrin, leader of the Conservative Independent Progressives. At the end of Thursday evening, you can tune in to the show Presence of Jazz. There's my dog. -My old Gambetta. -Hello, Martial. -Hello. -Are you having dinner? No, I have a meeting at 9 p.m. -You have to eat or you'll get sick. -Yes, but I don't want to stuff myself, because tonight is going to be rough. …against the attacks on freedom, those who trample the dignity of man, against all the sellouts of this country's independence! A speech that highlights statements made by Roland Favereau at the Press Club last Sunday. The Pope's trip to Beijing continues to be a topic of mixed discussion in the international press. The news has still not been confirmed by the Vatican and Chinese authorities have made no statements on the topic either. Breaking news has just arrived: Krauss the Gunman escaped this afternoon. A large police force has been established. This individual is dangerous. Recalling the threats he made at the end of his trial, he may be looking to settle a few scores. Your husband's carrots. It's natural, it's new, and it's sensual. It's the scent of Odoroflor. It only takes a few drops and unpleasant smells-- It's the classic story of a garbage collector who smelled so bad that even his coworkers had taken notice. I smell bad, but I'm taking care of it! Look at your cousin Brossard deodorizing himself. Very interesting. My poor darling, it has gotten bad. I should have drowned him when we were kids. Smelling good is easy with Deodophyl! Deodophyl Seriously, Martial, have you seen yourself? -Your tie. -Just leave it. Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. Tonight's headline: The escape of Richard Krauss. The frightening "Gunman" we all remember. He escaped from prison in an ambulance, and preliminary searches have been unsuccessful for the moment. There is worry that the terrorist network he led and that had been dismantled after his arrest may resume. Nothing about the Krauss case was straightforward. He was arrested in Djibouti, but his activities and network extended throughout Africa and across all of Europe. As far as he's concerned, he was accused of murder, but at the time it was often said that certain political figures owed him a lot. Give me a break, Marie-Hélène! Do you hear me? Seriously, Martial. The most disturbing rumors were still circulating at the time. Also important, during the investigation and trial, Krauss issued vague yet aggressive threats. I wasn't the only one involved in this case! They want me to pay for the others! I know what I'm talking about! Who are the others? Coming in the middle of the electoral campaign, this news could trigger revelations and even revenge. Overall, it's an event-- Good evening. -Hello, Marie-Hélène. -Hello, Constant. I don't know what's wrong with him tonight. He's nervous! It won't be long now. Just a little patience. You'll need it, I swear! -Shall we go? -Where? Really, Martial! "Where?" The meeting. -I told you he was acting strange. -I'll try to have him back to you early. Shall we? Let's go. What's going on with you? There's something I'm processing. …and according to the information we have, Mr. Jacques-Henri Steiner was killed by a rifle bullet fired at long range. By whom? Why? We'll share more details in our next edition. In Tanzania, the situation remains… Didn't you know Steiner? No. He wasn't with you in Djibouti? No, I don't remember. Constant, come over here by me. Don't be shy, come on! In other words, it's France with a capital F. What's wrong with him? We've gathered his last supporters. Ladies and gentlemen, our friend Martial Perrin has just arrived. And I give him my place at the podium. No! It's from here, among the faithful defenders of our freedoms, that I wish to address you this evening in a profound call for unity! I'll say it loud and clear: It's only by remaining united with one another that we will win this decisive battle. How much better we feel, drowned in the anonymous masses. How strong we feel-- How strong and bold we feel! That is why, before leaving, steadfastly anchored to the left of those centered on the right, and to the right of those centered on the left, we'll keep repeating: "The future is tomorrow." A one-minute speech was perhaps a bit short. I said what mattered. No more pointless babble. Well done with the part about unity! I couldn't have written it better. I don't know, I suddenly felt passionate. Hey, what's wrong with you? I told you, there's something I'm processing. Europe 1 Hello, this just in: Dr. Petrucci was murdered around half past midnight as he was leaving a restaurant. It seems that he was shot by a sniper on… -What's wrong? Are you sick? -I have a weird taste in my mouth. Obviously, rinse it out. …It's impossible not to associate this murder with that of Mr. Steiner. Are these crimes linked with Krauss's escape? Will there be another victim? To be continued. Before we talk about the campaign… Have you seen the time? I'm exhausted. It's not your meeting that should have tired you out. You know… Marie-Hélène, right now… Yes, I know. Ah! Remember we're having people over for dinner for our anniversary. Whose anniversary? Our wedding anniversary, my dear. You know we're married, right? It's already been a year! It's been 10 years. No, I mean, it's already been a year since our last anniversary. It has… Time flies, taking our youth with it. See you tonight. Are you OK, sir? I don't know what's wrong with me. I must have a fever. Shall I make you an herbal tea? No, come here! Come, close the shutters. Close the shutters. The light is hurting me. -Ask who it is before you open it. -Surely, it's Mr. Constant. OK, then tell him… Tell him I'm sick! -Hello, Therese. -Mr. Perrin isn't up. -What do you mean? -He's resting. He's sick. He's sick? -There you are! -What's going on? -What? -Oh, Constant, I'm not doing well. -What's wrong? -Everything is tight. All of it… I tell you, everything is tight. All of what? Are you in pain? Yes, I'm suffocating. Does that ever happen to you? -Oh, I'm suffocating… -You don't have a fever, anyway. -What do you know? -Well, you aren't hot. Well, so what? It's… a cold fever. Unfortunately, they are the worst. You know… Excuse me. Go on! It's my lungs. I'm not doing well. There's just something… I see "heartburn." This is for your stomach, not your lungs. Yes, but unfortunately, the flu always affects my stomach directly. Really, Coricide? Does it also affect your feet? When you're in pain, it's better than nothing. -You take what you have. -Well, if you don't have a fever… -Ah, no! -What? Now, listen! You're not going to make me get up, are you? -But there's the parade. -Yes, but in my state… Are you completely oblivious? If you don't participate in this parade, with how things are now, you leave the field open for Garrivier. Do you think your disaster at last night's meeting had a positive impact? Oh, yes, ah! You're good with that spray. You look like your cousin Brossard. I don't even have energy to read the papers. There's nothing interesting! They're just talking about Krauss, so there! Leave, it's not nice watching a man slip away. -It's over, isn't it? Is it over, Perrin? -You know… If Garrivier takes you down, I go with. So, if you don't mind getting up. You have no right to talk to me like that. I have every right! You wouldn't be much without me. If I were standing, you wouldn't dare speak to me like that. -Up and at it! -Ah, no! Go find Brossard! Put him in the parade! You're completely insane! But Brossard is very good. He'll leave us alone for once. -You're talking nonsense. -They mistake us for one another. Come on, is the show over yet? -What? -Oh, hey… Are you still there, Constant? I can't see you anymore. Farewell. There's to be no national funeral. I simply bid Marie-Hélène and you… farewell. You ham! My hands make your skin shiver. Surrender to me. Be my mistress for this seductive dance called the tango. Hey, Gilbert! Would you quit trying to sweet talk the customers? You don't mind, do you my dear? And we're off! You've completely lost it, Mom. Did you go out again last night? Quit coughing or at least cough on the beat. -Smoking like that is ruining your health. -Like you have any room to talk! But it's different for me. I smoke to keep myself from eating candy. I gained two more kilos, you know. Go on, play! Better watch out, I can still give you a smack! -Maybe you could make an effort. -Oh, hey now! I do this to help. It isn't my job. -What is your job? Being a slacker? -And the conversation gets better. -You're pathetic! -Yeah. Poor guy. You dance as badly as you act. I'm tired of killing myself to feed two freeloaders. Just think, I could be Mrs. Perrin right now. Hey, quit your whining. I've heard it all before. -Your cousin chased me quite a while. -I know, but it's not worth going over it again, because things between us aren't super great. I made a mistake. It's fate, huh? Nothing we can do about it. You would have made a nice couple. With that mug of his! His mug is worth more than yours, dummy! Not everyone is lucky enough to retire at 28, after being whistled at for half an hour in Swan Lake. Come here. You have to perform to be whistled at. That's something you don't have to worry about! Because I don't want to play just any role. That's what high standards in performing arts looks like. Well… Wait five years, my dear, and you'll see! What will you be doing in five years? In five years, I'll be in the prime of my life! I'll be able to take on all the big roles, like Cyrano and Hamlet. When that day comes, Mrs. Gisèle Brossard, ex-rising star… Yes, your highness! It's Mr. Louis XIV! -Mr. Brossard? -What is it regarding? The Art and Entertainment Agency. -Art and…? -Entertainment, yes. -And you are… -I'm a talent manager. -Can I have a word? -Please. -Hello, ma'am. -Leave it alone. -Well, still… -Just leave it alone. -As you wish. -Uh… you'll excuse me. You'll have to excuse me. I'm needed for work. If you'd like to follow me to the kitchen. If you'd like to… -This way. -Very good. Is it about a role? In my opinion, I'm pretty sure he's still in Paris. If he's in Paris, it's to find his former accomplices. He will strike again. He's a man desperate for revenge. And in my opinion… Steiner and Petrucci are the first on what could be a long list. Who's next? International Insurance Group, hello. The owners aren't home. We're investigating protective measures in France. Security locks, anti-theft devices. The owners are not here. Just a quick look. Excuse me. Metal shutters. Excellent. I said the owners are not here! I'm going to get into trouble. Now, that's my kitchen. There! Gentlemen, where are you going? What are you doing? The parade will disperse by seven o'clock at the latest, then you're free. My dear cousin must need a favor to think of me. A favor for 2,000 francs can't be too bad. Well, I'm catching up a bit, because, you know, he's made me miss out on a lot business. As soon as I show up for a role, I'm told I won't work, because I have his mug. I'm starting to get seriously fed up with having his mug. -You're wrong, he loves you very much. -Oh, I'm sure he does! When we were kids, he took advantage of our resemblance and blamed everything on me, you know. Let's move on. Oh, those were just jokes between cousins. Perrin could at least afford a good tailor. This doesn't fit right at all! -You look great! -I'm bursting out of this! It doesn't matter. I'll make up for it with my vigor and style. I'll act very friendly. "Ladies, my dear friends, these are the captains of Gascony." You're not going to act at all. You're going to be Perrin, with no more vigor, style, or cheer than he has, OK? -That's not how I see the character. -Well, that's how you'll have to see it. If you want it to be crappy, we'll do crappy, but it's a shame. You're wrong, because, believe me, I could have played the role of Perrin much better than him. That's right, come on. Where are you going? This is the beginning, my friend. My big break. And it's going to hurt a lot. DRESS SMALTO PERRIN FOR TOMORROW Please get in the set order. PERRIN FOR TOMORROW Signs followed by large banners. CONSERVATIVE INDEPENDENT PROGRESSIVES The section from Neuilly-sur-Seine in front of the 16th district. Thank you. We're going it alone. So much for party unity! We're about to start. -Stay put! -Ah, seriously! Go ahead. Loosen up. Find your stride. Not so much. Stand up straight. Smile. Look how he's walking. He's gone completely mad. Give a wave, now. No, that's Julius Caesar. FOR THE DEFENSE OF ALL FREEDOMS Move your hand. In a forward and backward motion. Smile. Stand up straight. -Do you understand anything I'm saying? -Watch it or I'll leave. OK, don't do anything. Just smile. There you go. Everyone for Perrin, the future is tomorrow! Everyone for Perrin, the future is tomorrow! Everyone for Perrin… We're broadcasting live from the events taking place this afternoon in Paris. The parade of Conservative Independent Progressives is heading toward Republic Square. It's also near Republic Square, but not on Boulevard Voltaire, where, in the rain, the big parade of left-wing parties and main central trade unions is taking place. An event of several thousand supporters, according to the organizers, and a few hundred, according to estimates from police headquarters. May I have an autograph? The little one recognized you. "I smell bad, but I'm taking care of it!" What's your name? Brossard. Gilbert Brossard. Oh, yeah! You see, that man smells bad, but he's taking care of it. Unlike your dad. Come on. It's the Russian retreat. CRS SS! CRS SS! Let's stick together! Garrivier! Let's stick together! -This way! -Watch out! Wait, let me go, I'll talk to them. Soldiers! No! -Soldiers, friends! -Leave it! Get down! Spread out to the left! Fan out! -No, wait! -Come on, let's go. CIP, follow me! CIP! CIP, follow me! Come here! You dressed up like the middle class to lead these thugs? How smart! No, listen. I'm Jean-Louis Constant from the CIP. Hey, come on, now. -Hey! -Come on, in you go. -Let's go. -Get me out of here. -Oh, it's Martial. There's my boy! -Hello, Mom. Mrs. Chalebouis, this is my Martial. Oh, Mrs. Perrin! Handsome, isn't he? You better have some port, it'll do you good. It's the one he brought me for Christmas, the last time I saw him. You must not see him often. Not as much as I would like, but he calls me regularly. Or he has Mr. Constant call me. He's very nice too. Isn't that right, my boy? Stay a while. -You're in your pajamas. -Hmm? You're in your pajamas. Yes, I was napping, but then I wanted to see you. So, I just threw on a jacket. What time is it? Almost 8 p.m. -Will you eat a little something with me? -Yeah, yeah. -Can I help you, Mrs. Perrin? -Yes, of course. I'm going to make you a nice omelet like when you were little. Yes! It's been three years since I ate with my son. Do you remember the little snack on Rue de Rivoli? What a great memory. Ah, as soon as he saw-- Won't you shut up? …the arrest of Richard Krauss the Gunman. He was arrested at a police checkpoint on the road to Pontoise. By the end of this report, we should have more details. Our reporters are already on-site. Look, I found the foie gras you gave me for my 70th birthday. -What are you doing? -I'm leaving. Yes, Mom, I have a job. Say, you wouldn't have 100 francs, would you? Yes. No, Mom, 100 new francs. Oh, all right. Oh, boy… -Here. -You don't mind? With the 800 francs you give me per month, I have plenty. -I'll pay you back. -When you can. -See you on Christmas Day, right? -Of course. -Will you be here between 4 and 5? -Where else would I be? You look good, you know? He is kind. Good evening. PUBLIC ADVERSARIAL MEETING PERRIN FOR TOMORROW The policy we pursue cannot be the work of a single individual. Men come and go, no one is immortal. -Ah, Perrin is here. -Yes. It's with these ideas, and these ideas alone… Mr. Constant. How are you? I'm fine. EMERGENCY EXIT …apart from any issue of personality. -No more fever? -Say, I was supposed to be free at 7 p.m. Where's Perrin? What are you doing here? They picked me up. But I'm telling you, I'm not staying! …the progressives of tomorrow. Hey, no! It's more for overtime! …tomorrow! Who better than us to ensure the continuity of the modern world? -Where were you? -At home. -I was looking after myself. -Brossard is here now. You brought him here? Are you completely mad? Come on, let's go! -So, your lungs are better? -Let's go, before it's a disaster. You're not going anywhere. Not in this outfit! Shit! I'll ask Brossard to give you the suit. -Wait there. -OK, but hurry up! If one day, by some sort of aberration, a member of this office were to lose our trust, we would part with heavy hearts. But the CIP's honor would remain intact. Give us strength to separate from one another when necessary… I'll be back. …for the interest of our cause. Save my spot. And as I speak tonight, from this podium… RESTROOMS No. -Go in there and undress. -What? Give me the suit, quickly. Honestly! You shouldn't treat me like this! I have a heart and a soul. Well, OK… Money can't buy everything. The jacket, the shirt, and the tie, come on! OK, one second! Europe 1 A special report to inform you that there was an error in the broadcast around 8 p.m. regarding Richard Krauss's arrest. The police picked up one of his accomplices. The Gunman is still on the run. MODERN HOTEL What's gotten into you? Oh, no. Where are the pants? I'll see if I have the next size up. Perrin! Let me speak! Listen to me! Listen! It's Brossard. Are you there? Constant, are you there? Mr. Constant? Listen! Listen to me! Oh, listen! I was saying, Perrin may have his faults. But then again, who doesn't? FARMING FOR FARMERS -Are you there? -Obviously, where else would I be? Get dressed, fast! Here, try the 48. It's a bigger size. Let's go! "Perrin! Perrin!" Listen to these idiots! My friends! Shit! Will you get me Perrin's recording? -Why, he's not speaking? -No, he… -The Tourcoing speech? -As usual. What recording? Perrin's speeches are pre-recorded. But what do you want me to do? Just follow along! Are you crazy? I've never done this. Just move your lips. You're far away, they won't notice. Go on. SO OUR CHILDREN CAN LIVE My friends! My worker, craftsmen, trader, farmer, and executive friends. My fellow citizens, my brothers! Who understands you better than I do? Who knows the problems you face better than I do? Then, who better than me to find the solutions? The answer? Nobody! What great hope we have before us! If you knew what a wonderful path we could take together. And… Let the others come and try to delay our march toward the future! Yes, I declare tonight, with great enthusiasm, that your fight is my fight! And you will always find me on the front line, strong and resolute! With all my power and all my strength! Please excuse our friend Martial Perrin. He is tired from a long and challenging campaign. Victory sings, for us Her gates have opened from afar Liberty leads all of our strides! And from north to the south The mighty horn of war Came the time for its battle cry! Tremble, enemies of France Kings drunk on blood and pride The sovereign people shall advance Tyrants descend in graves to hide! The Republic calls for us! Let us know how to vanquish or how to fail For she has given the Frenchman his life And for her he must give to prevail! For she has given the Frenchman his life And for her he must give to prevail! The Republic calls for us! Let us know how to vanquish or how to fail For she has given the Frenchman his life For she has given the Frenchman his life And for her he must give to prevail! Oh, 11:15, Gisèle is going to moan again. You could have skipped singing "La Madelon." You heard them. They didn't want me to leave, I had to do an encore. What? No, don't thank me. That would be too much effort. You have been paid. Yes, but a kind word every now and then wouldn't hurt. Artists are sensitive, you know. What's wrong? Why do you keep looking in the rearview mirror? Watch where you're going, damn it! What… Oh! Speed up, maybe. Speed up! This isn't the way to the Porte de Pantin. No, but I wanted to lose them. Oh, I don't like this at all. This thing really moves. We had a hard time following you. Captain Javert. -Javert? -Yes. He was my great-grandfather. My regards, Mr. Perrin. At night, it's better to avoid the ring roads. They're not safe. Where were you going? To the Porte de Pantin. -The Porte de Pantin? -Yes… To his sister-in-law's house. I'll escort you. You can go to her house later. -No, it's-- -Yes! Ah, no! I'll take the side streets there. I won't be in any danger. I'm sorry, Mr. Perrin, but I have very strict orders. If something were to happen to a public figure like you, during an election, they would never forgive me. I have four children, you know? -Ah, no! -Mr. Perrin… By the way, I had totally forgotten the 100 francs you lent me. It was 500. -Oh, yes! -Come on, Mr. Perrin, please. -Oh, boy! -Come on. -Yes. -Come on, get in. OK! I'm not taking this lying down. Want to sit down a second? You've been pacing two hours and haven't said a word. You're making me dizzy. If you don't want to, say so, and I'll go to sleep. I don't know why you hit on me. You're being strange. Don't worry. I'll give you a little something. Who do you think I am? I'm not a whore! Well, why did you come up then? It gets so boring at night, all alone. It's either this or go to the movies to see stories of people who are bored. Oh, really? Well! At least someone's having fun. And I felt sorry for you, looking so lost. We make a great match. Hey… you look like that other guy. That other guy from the CIP. We should rise up against scum like that, shouldn't we? We would be shot. We'd get our heads blown off, and it would be over sooner. Aren't there days you'd take a bullet in the head just to get it over with? Yes, well… -What's wrong? -Huh? -Are you hiding? -No. -Are you wanted? -No, let it go. Police, open up! -It's the police! -Leave it, we'll die together! Get off of me, it's the police! Shoot! What are you waiting for? No, don't shoot! She's crazy! -Get up! -Dirty cop! Your papers. I forgot them. I'm Brossard. Gilbert Brossard, the actor. This actor is mouthy! Come on, load him up! They're here, Marie-Hélène! They're finally here! It took them long enough. Martial! What were you doing, Martial? We've been waiting for you. We're starving! Happy anniversary, Martial! What's going on? It's your wedding anniversary… Well, it's theirs anyway. I had completely forgotten. Tell your friends to come have a drink. Come on up! That's nice, Marie-Hélène, but these gentlemen have to go. No use in worrying his wife for no reason. Good evening, gentlemen. Thank you very much. Good evening, gentlemen. Thank you. -Good evening, gentlemen. -That's it. There you go. Very well. Let's go in, otherwise they won't leave. Stay here and keep an eye on things. I don't want trouble. I've got four children. OK, Taboureau? I've got three, Captain. Then, I don't want to see seven little mouths go hungry. Happy anniversary! Happy anniversary, dear Marie-Hélène. It's a beautiful day for us all, because by making Martial happy, you're making France happy. Bravo! You're more beautiful than ever. You're literally glowing. It's all the memories. She's adorable. I love you. What? What's wrong? -You're bloated tonight. -It's the fatigue. Oh! Hey, now! What is it, Gambetta? You don't like your master? He's playing. Dirty bastard. Unfortunately, we're not going to be able to stay. Martial just dropped by for a hug, and… Are you crazy? We have a night session with the steering committee. Martial didn't have lunch. He needs to eat. Shall we eat? No, further down. Keep going. Over there, at the end. Go on. Sit down. I told him, "My dear friend, you are a jerk." My dear Solange… If anyone talks to you, speak generally, OK? Just general ideas. Oh no, dear. This is my spot next to Martial. Oh, excuse me. Constant, you're to the right of the minister. Oh! There are special moments in life. I would like to thank you for the kind things you said about Martial this morning on the radio. You know he has all our support. The minister has spoiled you again. Martial! -Martial! This morning, on the radio. -Yes. Oh, yes! Martial knows that if we win on Sunday, it will be thanks to your support. Right? -Right, Martial? -Oh, yes! Of course he knows! Martial knows it very well! I said to Father Mulot, "Forgive me, Father, but you're a total moron." Oh, salmon! Fish is good, isn't it? That looks good too. Carrots? Oh, the poor man! I know they're not exciting, but only three grams of cholesterol. -Yes, but the one time I'm here… -Yes, Martial. Marie-Hélène is right. Can I at least have some dressing? No, my dear. See, Gambetta doesn't want you to. What's different about Martial? Excuse me? Yes, there's something different about Martial. Nothing has changed. It's just the fatigue. What do you expect! Campaigns are getting harder. It's crazy. It's complete madness. -Thérèse? -Yes, ma'am? -Relight the candles. -Yes, ma'am. No, Marie-Hélène. It's nice. It sets the mood. So, Perrin, in the long term, what role do you think the franc will play in the international monetary system? Uh, well… I think it will depend on the structures and prospects of the new Europe. Forgive me, Constant, but I'm asking our economist, Perrin. Well, yes… I do believe it will depend, to a certain extent, and I could be wrong, but I think it will depend, to a certain extent, if I may, it will depend on the prospects and structures of Europe. And not only of Europe, but, I will add, of the new Europe. The new Europe, to which, if I may, I raise my glass, and say to you all, from the bottom of my heart, bottoms up! Rossi, the door! Go ahead. Hey, take it easy! We're not animals. Go on. Hello. What's the matter? Krauss took out another guy tonight. -Seriously? -Yes. -That makes three. -You don't say! And it won't be his last. Good, makes for fewer scumbags. Dear Martial, doesn't it bother you that there's a guy who looks like you on television? Who looks like him? Let's not exaggerate. Oh, yes. I think so. -Who are you talking about? -"I smell bad, but I'm taking care of it!" There's no resemblance. He has such a vulgar face! He looks like a real idiot. Well, I think the boy is very good. It's not easy. It's not easy to do. -Martial, you're fibbing. -Oh, now! You get hives every time you see him on TV. Very interesting. I thought Perrin loved his cousin very much. You talk about yourself in the third person? Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Like our kings. Are you related to this man? Yes, ma'am. -He's my first cousin. -Ah! I didn't know. Yes, ma'am. And there is nothing… There is nothing to be ashamed of. There certainly is. A Brossard… A Brossard is as good as a Perrin, you know. What do I have… What do I have that he doesn't? You're smarter. You have more charm. Me, I have more charm than Brossard? Really, are you… Are you kidding? Brossard didn't have a chance. Because he slaves away, and he doesn't always have enough to eat. -No, but he drinks enough. -Yes, OK, he drinks… He may have his reasons. Hey, I'd like to know where my cousin is right now. That's for sure. OK, good night, Martial. I hope you get better. Yes, he'll be fine now. Good night, Marie-Hélène. Don't get too crazy for your anniversary tonight. -These Perrins are idiots. -I was going to tell you. Good night. -Get up! -But… Come on, stand up! Get up, now! Are you crazy or what? Well, Marie-Hélène, I think we too… -What? -Well… -We're going to have to go. -Have you seen the state he's in? I know, but unfortunately, three days before the elections… Screw your elections! You're going to kill him. You nearly have! But there are still things to be done. You have become inhumane, Constant. Politics are all you care about anymore. At times I wonder if you aren't just as impotent as our poor cousin! -Which cousin? -Brossard! -Brossard is impotent? -You were the one who told me. -Be nice and leave us, my friend. -What's gotten into you? Leave us, I said, or I'll break you in two! -You're crazy! -Brossard is impotent, huh? Humiliation has its limits! Life has been unfair enough as it is. There comes a time when we need to tip the scales in favor of justice. Don't do it, Perrin will be home soon! Let him come home! Brossard! Put on your leathers. -I'm sorry? -Put on your leather suit. You want me… Leather? Do you listen to music? -Ah, you're still here? -Yes. Are you worried about something? No, it's fine as long as he stays home. Would you be informed if anything happened? Yes, I've got the prefecture here. …Strasbourg, at the crossing. -And nothing special tonight? -No. Wait, Zimmermann, an industrialist, was shot. -Oh, really? -Over by Étoile. Really? He had a card pinned to him: "Souvenir de Djibouti." Funny, isn't it? -Huh? -Oh, yes. -Yes, that's very funny. -It's funny. You're going to beat me, aren't you? I know you're going to beat me, you brute! What are you doing, Véronique? I can't sleep with all that music. The Bol d'Or is back again. It's been a long time! Go to bed, Véronique, you have school tomorrow. Where are their manners? Beat me! What are you waiting for? Why are you looking at me like that? You dirty biker! Over here, my dear. You'll be able to hear better. -It's Perrin's place. -An explosive. I don't know, I can't explain. It just happened. They must have blow up the stereo. There's so much smoke. -You called, Chief? -Yes. -You're from the 8th district? -Yes. -You have a car? -Of course. -Is that the car? -It's over there. Now, I don't dance the tango anymore. I just do meetings. -That's nice. -And parades. -And I sing. -Yes. -Victory… -Right. -Victory sings… -That's right. There was a big explosion, so obviously… Go on, hide him in the car until Javert gets here. -I'll be better. -You will. Explain that to these gentlemen. Let me explain, I have this outfit but there is no motorcycle. -Yeah, yeah. -Easy. It'll be OK. I don't want to take the blame. -Yeah. -Let's go. -Where's Perrin? -In the car with colleagues. Which colleagues? What car? -In the car… -What car? They must have left. Early retirement, Taboureau. At quarter salary. Do you have a radio? -Yes, in my car. -Then, let's go. That is, I would just like to explain what happened. This outfit was loaned to me. Hello? It's Max. We did it. We have the package. -Oh, really? -OK. -Over. -I see. It's over, they have the package. No, but I'm telling you, this outfit was loaned to me. Hey, you know? That's what you need to understand. It's… "Martial Perrin." See that? That's right. There's no package in it. That's his name. "Martial Perrin." Block all roads leaving Paris. Activate the Marguerite plan immediately. Over. -What? -Perrin is missing. -I know. -How do you know? -He was just kidnapped. -Really? No, I didn't know. -But I felt it. -Not a word, OK? It'll be better for me and for you. Let's go! We had a hard time getting our hands on you, Martial. You don't look happy to see your old friend again. Excuse the somewhat cavalier way we snuck you out, but it was the only way to get you out of there. My dear Martial. Not very chatty, huh? Less talkative than at poor Krauss's trial. Champagne? Whiskey? Ouzo? Or some candy? Huh? You really held poor Krauss's head under water. I think the Gunman is going to be happy to see you again. -The Gunman is coming? -He's on his way. Steiner, Petrucchi, Zimmermann, and the two of us. The Djibouti crew. And since he likes you best, I intend to make him a deal. Your skin in exchange for mine. But I'm not Perrin! He'll say anything when he's afraid. Still the frightened little animal I met on the beach of Mykonos. But I'm Brossard. Gilbert Brossard, the actor. "I smell bad, but I'm taking care of it!" That's me. I'm not Perrin. No, I'm not Perrin. I'm not Perrin. "Martial Perrin." -It's not good to lie. -No, it's not mine… It was his wife who forced me to wear this. It's for riding motorcycles… If you aren't Perrin, now you know too much, so I'll kill you right now. Oh, yes. I'm Perrin. Perrin, that's me. -Mr. Brossard? -Gilbert Brossard. Please. Say, haven't I seen you somewhere? -I'm an actor. -Ah, that must be it. You're an actor? So, actors just walk around without their papers? -Where do you live? -Thirty-four. That right? Euh… No… Twelve. Euh… Rue de la… Pompe. Near the Porte de Pantin. You seem confused. I often have memory lapses. Must be a pain for an actor, right? Rooster! Run a verification on… Mr. Brossard. Do you have a phone? -Yes, but… -Want the number? -Yes. -You don't have it? Find Mr. Brossard's number and place the call. Yes, Captain. Is that really necessary? Absolutely. It's a mandatory formality. Thank you. Are you related to Martial Perrin? Yes. Why didn't you say so, Mr. Brossard? You should have told me! How was I supposed to know? Hey, listen… I'll have someone take you home. -No, it's not necessary. -No, I want to, Mr. Brossard! My bosses would hound me. -No, no. -Yes, yes! Rooster, have someone take… No, take Mr. Brossard right to his door yourself. -No… -You're welcome. And my apologies, Mr. Brossard. -Thank you. -Oh, euh… As for the person who was with you, I'm unfortunately going to have to keep her. She insulted my men. Do what you have to, Captain. -The law is the law. -Ah, I… -Yes. -Oh, really? My regards, Mr. Brossard. -Captain. -Have a safe trip home! He's been killed. I'm sure he's been killed. I told you, he's safe at the Ministry of the Interior. I want to see him. I swear, he'll be here this afternoon. I want to see him right now. Everything is fine, ma'am. Calm down. No, I don't believe you. You're hiding the truth. He's missing. You didn't protect him. You didn't do your job. That's the truth! You're all worthless! -I'm going to alert the press. -Please, ma'am. Please! No! In the name of God… It's OK. Oh, leave me alone! Maid, go get me one of your boss's suits. I'll bring Mr. Perrin back home. DANCE So, did you have a good night? Disgusting pig. Ha! We'll talk about it tonight. Don't just stand there! Get to work. Take Miss Lambert. Take Miss Lambert. Didn't you hear me? Gilbert, take off your jacket. Ah, the scumbag is just waking up! Pathetic man! Mr. Brossard, can I talk to you? -What is it? -Mr. Brossard? Oh, yes. Yes? Gilbert Brossard. The actor. -Captain Javert, may I have a word? -Gladly. You good? Are you good? Get comfortable. They're here. -How many are there? -I don't know. Is Krauss with? I can only make out their silhouettes. Play! And sing. All of you, sing! "O Tannenbaum." Sing, Martial. -I'm not feeling very vocal. -Sing. I don't like being spoken to in that tone. O Christmas tree O Christmas tree How lovely are thy branches That's it. Your boughs so green in summertime Stay bravely green in wintertime O Christmas tree O Christmas tree How lovely are thy branches Are you afraid, Martial? Nein, meiner. Ich bin tired. Such a beautiful romantic death. Like in Mayerling. That's the dream. O Christmas tree O Christmas tree -Wilfrid, Perrin, get out of here! -Catch him! I'm sorry, Martial, but you're too unruly. Krauss, I have Perrin. He's all yours! I loved you… Martial. I'll be damned, it looks like it was made for you. Perrin stands up straight. -Yes, I know. -Well, then, do it. Here, take your papers. Come on, let's go, Brossard. Unfortunately, you don't have your cousin's style. Ah, he's leaving again! You're very busy lately. Ah, that mug! You won't last long! Come on, Mom, back at it! -There! -Leave him be! Leave him be, for goodness sake! I told you he wasn't dead. Go on. -Mr. Perrin! It's him. -Let him through! -Mr. Perrin! -Let him be! Why weren't you on the radio this morning, Mr. Perrin? What… It's nothing, just basic intimidation. Hey, there you are. Hey, between us, Perrin is pretty well off. There you are, my dear. -You're finally here. -Mm hmm. Where were you? I couldn't find you after the explosion. Oh, it was such a good night. What's wrong? Nothing, I'm just a bit tired. I'm going to get dressed. Hey, that's enough, Brossard. Don't overdo it, you're not at home. Ah! You know who it is? Brossard, the mutt. To buy some time. Pretty good idea, huh? You wouldn't have thought of it. Ah, no. His wife is relieved, the press is relieved, I'm the only one who isn't! But seriously, where is Perrin? For God's sake. -You're a real piece of work. -Watch it, Constant, it's me. Yes, I know. Where were you? It couldn't have been Brossard. Marie-Hélène couldn't have slept with impotent Brossard! Obviously not. I've been spared nothing. Good night. -Where are you going? -To bed. Yes, but after the elections? -I'm going to bed and staying there. -Yes, but after the elections? I didn't get rich in Djibouti. Yes, my friend, everybody knows! I have a position to secure. Right, Perrin? So, listen carefully… We need to double our numbers. Got it, Taboureau? Captain, we're ready to go. -Where? -On TV. -What for? -The debate. -With whom? -With him. -Brossard? -Yes, Brossard. -You're crazy. I won't risk it. -But I will. -What? -If I lose my spot, I'll kill you. I'll kill you. Got it? I'll say you were a Palestinian agent. -Do I look Palestinian? -Or Auvergnat. Come on. Hey! Damn it! BUS STOP -Want to get in? -No… No, I'm just walking. -Go on. -Huh? Climb in. -Come on. -I'm going. POLICE STOP Impulse. Headsets, Cameramen. Get your cameras ready. We're ready to go, kids. Hurry up. Move two back. What's that shadow on three? It's a headset, they said. Relax, Favereau is looking at us. Damn, he looks good. Smile, it will lower his confidence. They're looking at us, smile. It'll mess him up. It's going to be a bloodbath. -The mutt learns quickly. Is it working? -Yes, it's working. -Still no news from the other one? -The other one? -The other one! -Ah, no… What a mess! The two guards at Gate C have been knocked out. It's Krauss. Perrin! SHOW DEBATE DRESSING ROOMS Call for backup. You, go find Brossard. -Who? -Euh, Perrin. Mr. Javert, a patrol just arrested a guy at a checkpoint. What do I care? His papers are under the name Martial Perrin. Oh, that changes everything. -Bring him to me now. -OK. -Let's go, Taboureau! -Yes, sir! Wrap up the mic check, please. OK, good evening, ladies and gentlemen. The debate will start in a few-- Don't start quite yet. -I've got a homeland security problem. -We're going on air any minute now. So, you'll be late. -It won't be the first time. -You're very kind, thank you! Mr. Favereau, please. Close the doors. We're on air in five minutes. -Looking for something? -The debate studio. It's back there. Jean-Jacques, go get the actors. Let's get started. OK, let's go. -Director, good morning. -Everything going well? -Let's hope. We'll see. -Perfect. Here he is. We found him. Oh, I could almost kiss him. -Where's the other one? -I don't care, I have the real one. -Yes, but we should find him. -I'll tell my men to take care of it. -Oh, a weight has been lifted. -Not for me. Lambert and Pajot, join the others, OK? And no mess-ups, you hear? Berthier, be a dear and go ask Mr. Perrin to take his seat. Thank you. It's not double-breasted, but it has the stripe. -They won't notice. Come on! -What are you doing? You're going on TV for a major station at peak time, with a 60% viewing rate. -When? -Now! To take Perrin's place in the debate? Oh no… Listen, let's not do this again! Seriously… It's the chance of a lifetime. Do you want to miss it? Listen, I don't know this thing. I'm an actor, I need a script. Here, take a look at this. It's an outline of what you should say. You can improvise. You do that very well. -That I know. -This is completely insane. I can see it now! You're going to be great! -No. -Yes! -In front of ten million viewers. -No, no… -For five thousand francs! -Yes, well. Five thousand francs, OK. But the other guy is going to ask me questions. -Yes, that's the idea. -What do I do? You sneered and say: "I'm glad you asked." After that, don't let him speak again. Then you say: "Sons of laborers, grandsons of laborers, laborer myself." -Build on the theme. -Yes. -It's not hard. -No. -Is that what you think? -Yes! With two months of rehearsal, I'd have it down for you. -We don't have two months. -Every detail! "Sons of laborers, grandsons of laborers!" Maria, where is my tunic? SHOW THE APOSTLES -Take your places quietly. We're live. -OK. This man must be condemned. What is his name? Jesus, son of Joseph. Pontius Pilate is the procurator of Judaea. He is the one you should speak to. -And then, what do I say? -Whatever you like. -Talk about your problems. -I have plenty of those. So, go for it! Cost of living, job security… -My wife? -Sure, if you get stuck. Listen, keep it simple. That's the best I can tell you. -And natural. -Yes. Let your opponent speak as little as possible. -Gentlemen, please. -Yes, we're going. "Sons of laborers, grandsons of laborers…" "Laborer myself." Come on, suck it in. Huh? Break a leg. We did a random name draw to find out who will open the debate. Mr. Favereau won, therefore, Mr. Favereau, you have the floor. I would like to start off by congratulating Martial Perrin on his ability to frequently change his mind, a feat that requires great skill. -A great start. -Bravo, Mr. Perrin. Well, I'm… I'm very glad… you asked me that question. But I didn't ask you anything. Really? No, but… No, but… No, but… you should know that! -I just wonder if the Martial Perrin… -Yes. who was left of center-right, -then right of center-left, -Left… is the person in front of me. -That's right! Are you asking me? -I'm asking myself. Oh, really? Well, then… So? -I don't think so. -You… This is going well without me, so I'll go. Please! Mr. Favereau, it's time to cut to the chase. Since it's the moment of truth, tell us, Perrin, what was your exact role in the mysterious Djibouti case. Thank you for asking the question. It's an… It's an interesting question. Let me finish. I didn't interrupt you when you were speaking. Ah, no. We are hanging on your every word. "Sons of laborers…" "Sons of laborers, grandsons of laborers, -laborer myself." -Yes, we know the spiel. -Yes. -What an actor! -You don't like actors? -I do, but only good ones. I'm not a good actor? Not good enough to fool French citizens. Your empty words have ostracized you from the Republic, democracy, and the people of France! -Repeat what you just said. -I'm not afraid to repeat it. You are being ostracized by the Republic, democracy, and the people of France! -What a pig. -Please, go ahead! At first, it was fine. He said it well: "Democracy, the Republic…" Really, that part was fine, but then, at the end, he said: "The people of France." You know? It lacks conviction. You really have the gall to give me lessons in conviction? Yes. Oh, no. The people know who their true friends are! I love the people! -Oh, woe is me! -Listen, this is unbearable! Mr. Perrin, I think we've gone off-topic. Not at all, my friend. We're completely on-topic. You have to admit, it's interesting knowing whether or not he loves the people of France. Because the way he said it, I don't believe him. We don't believe him. Do you believe him? This is crazy. Mr. Perrin, I must call you to order. Yes, I love the people! And I'll shout it out loud! -Yes, but… -I love the people! But my friend, it's not… How can I explain this? It's not a… It's not a matter of saying it out loud, it's a matter of feeling it inside. I… I'll show you what I mean, if I may. -I love the people. -Yes, I love the people. Yes, but… it needs to come from your gut. -Yes, I love the people! -I love the people! Then, after that, you're in control of your text, of your breathing. OK? Then, you can say: "I love the people." You see? "I love the people." Then, you can do whatever you want. "I love the people." You can change it. "I love the people." A bit lighter. Yes, I love the people! No, now it sounds like you're talking about a casserole. Listen, if this joke is going to continue, I'm leaving the set. No! Mr. Favereau, please. The debate has just begun. -Sit down. -Sit down a moment. SHOW THE APOSTLES -What are you doing? -I had to find another tunic. Are there 12 apostles there? Let me count. This is the last meal we will have together. The time has come. What must be done shall be done. It is in honesty, that I tell you, one of you will betray me. And it's you, Judas, who… -"…will deliver me." -will deliver me. What's going on? Who is this idiot? -Cut! -We can't, we're live! You bastard! You hired this guy with Perrin's mug to play a traitor! As we get ready to close this debate, Mr. Favereau, it's your turn to ask Mr. Perrin one last question. I completely agree. So, let's get to the question that myself and all French people are wondering: How do you and your friends intend to tackle the high cost of living, the ever-increasing price of bread, and steak that costs 80 francs per kilo? Per kilo of what? -Steak. -Are you talking about fillets? Sure, I don't know. My friend, you're talking about a different world. I'm talking about what I've seen, what the people have seen. Let's talk about shoulder and ribs. -Sure, let's talk ribs. -Do you know how much they cost? -Of course. -Give us a number. -It's outrageous, like everything else. -I'm asking you for a specific number. I can't give you an exact number. It depends on the season. Sixteen francs. -Sixteen francs per kilo. -You're well informed. -I'm the one who does the shopping. -Good for you. Do you realize how much it costs nowadays to make beef stew? You need a kilo and a half of ribs. You have your vegetables, carrots, turnips, and sausage. It's really… -"Sausage," really… -You mustn't eat beef stew very often. I will not allow you to say that. I eat it, like all French people do! -And you don't put sausage in your stew? -No, I don't. What do you put in it? Same as everyone. I use vegetables, shank… -Ah, yes, shank! -Yes. How much does it cost? -That's not the problem. -Mr. Perrin, please! Do you mind? Would you allow me to make my case? As I was saying, for four people… You can take notes. For four people, you need a kilo and a half of ribs. You need your vegetables, carrots, and turnips in equal proportion. Don't forget your herbs and onions. It's unbearable, I'm telling you! Gentlemen, please, we only have time for-- What was that? It's Krauss! Lock everything down! -Lock it down! -Lock the exits. Easy! Oh, Perrin! My dear cousin! You bastard! Listen, Gilbert… Listen… I'll show you! You want him to shoot me instead of you, huh? Scumbag! You better tell him! You better tell Krauss that you're Perrin! You bastard! You better tell him! It's just us two, my friend! Brossard… Scumbag! Don't shoot! This was a role for Belmondo. It smells bad, doesn't it, Brossard? Yes, but I'm taking care of it! Let's go, scumbag! Perrin! Hold on. Hold on, I'm coming. No! -It's Perrin. -No way. Help me, Taboureau. We're good, it's Brossard! Keep going! Go get the ambulance! Come on, over there! Wake up, Perrin. Krauss is dead. You're safe, Perrin. No, no more Perrin, I tell you. No more Perrin! -Everything is fine, calm down, Perrin. -No more Perrin… We have to keep going after what happened. -OK, Perrin? -OK. Make it better, Constant. -Come on. -I can't take anymore. -Let's go. -I want to go to bed. I want to go to bed. TO MY DEAR COUSIN I'm going to say a few words at my grave. It's a rare opportunity. Are you coming to listen, Mr. Constant? No, I'm drafting your speech for the National Assembly. Write something good, something touching. -That's what I'm best at. -Leave it to me. OK. Hey, one day I'd like to wear a uniform. You know, with stars and everything. Think about it, OK? Farewell, Brossard. You're better lying down than you were standing. The immortal legends of theater pay tribute to you. And I'll say to you, as said in Hamlet, which you would have played so well, I'll say to you: "Good night, sweet Prince." "May hosts of angels, sing you to sleep." Thank you. Thank you for him, thank you very much. Thank you. That's it. My condolences, dear Gisèle. There, there. I know, but it's over. Oh, there. You loved him that much? -Of course. -There you have it. You don't know what you have until it's gone. Remember that in the future, my dear Gisèle. What will become of me? Don't worry, I won't abandon you. I'll talk with you about him. About the admirable man that he was. -Admirable, I don't know… -Oh, yes. You know, I really want to get to know you better. Oh, me too. Yes, of course. I have my life, but maybe once or twice a week? Maybe three times… Huh? Come on, I promise. I promise. Subtitle translation by: Emily Moorlach
