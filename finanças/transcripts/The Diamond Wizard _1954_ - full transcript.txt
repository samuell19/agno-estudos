(dramatic orchestral music) (sparks crackling) (pensive music) (explosion booming) (horn honking) (bright swing music) (coin clattering) Operator, give me long distance will ya, please? Long distance. Put me through to your chief supervisor will you, please? Hello? This is a federal agent speaking. The code number is X688J. I want you to put me through to Washington D.C. Capital, 0404. Thank you. What? Well, can't you clear the circuit? This is important. No, no, no, no, all right. Well, you better call me back. The number is Minneapolis 6792. And hurry it up will you? It's important. Goodbye. (music continues) You like being in the dark? Not particularly. That's why I'm here. You met the boys like you promised? No, no, I didn't. A million bucks is a big deal. I'll need a little more time. I'm afraid you've run out of time. [Sweeney] Hey, put down that English cannon. What's the idea? Hoxie. Hello, Sweeney. [Man] So you know him, huh? I ought to. He set me up for five years once. He's a Treasury Agent, a TEA man. - [Man] Dirty lying cop! - (fist thuds) Easy. Remember, he's got something we want. Yeah, that right. Come on, Sweeney, where is it? (fist thuds) (Hoxie grunts) (bright music) (lamp clattering) (fist thuds) (shot firing) (siren wailing) Cops! Come on, let's try the roof. Come on! (sirens wailing continues) (phone ringing) (airplane engine whirring) (typewriter keys clacking) (gate agent speaking faintly) (men chattering faintly) - Sergeant Hunter and Mr. - Dennison are here, Sir. Oh, good. - Send them right in. - Very good, Sir. You can go in now. Mr. Dennison, may I introduce our Commissioner of Police, Sir Stafford Beach? - How do you do, Sir? - How do you do, Mr. Dennison? - Thank you, Hunter. - Thank you, Sir. This is Mr. Pritchard of the South Africa High Commissioner's Office. - How do you do, Sir? - How do you do? Mr. Hawkins of the Gems & Minerals Department, British Museum. - How are you? - How do you do, Sir? And Mr. Blake, one of London's leading precious stone experts. How do you do? Do you have it with you, Mr. Dennison? [Joe] Here you are, Sir. (anticipatory music) I've called you gentlemen in because we'd like to have your opinion on this stone. Certainly, Sir Stafford. If you'll just give us a minute. Yes. You sent for me, Sir? Ah, McClaren. I want you to meet Mr. Dennison, United States Treasury Department. How do you do, Mr. Dennison? McClaren. Inspector McClaren, Special Branch. See? There. Well, gentlemen, what do you say? In our opinion it's a very fine stone. Quite flawless. In fact, I'd say very valuable. Could you give us any idea just how valuable? (chuckles) Well, it's rather difficult to say after just a cursory examination. I would you say somewhere in the neighborhood of 20,000 pounds wouldn't you, Paul? Mm hm. I can't quite place where it's from. It has a most astounding depth of color. Hm. I don't think it's Brazilian, but, but... Thank you very much, gentlemen. You'll send in your written report as usual? Yes, certainly. Goodbye. Goodbye. Good day. - Bye. - How are ya, Mac? [Mac] Fine, thanks. - [Mr. Pritchard] (sighs) - I still can't believe it. Well, we'll soon know for sure. (machine whirring) Refractive index, 2.42. Weight, 23.70 carats. Specific gravity normal for diamond. Color, perfect blue/white. Well? It meets every test I can give it. It's a perfect diamond, except is artificial. Made by man. So it's come at last. The perfect synthetic diamond. We'd hope that your people in Washington were wrong about this. If these stones can be produced in quantity, passed off in the world market as real, the whole economy of my country is wrecked. And if their production lies in criminal hands, a world standard of value will have been destroyed. There's no possible doubt about it? No, Sir. Many attempts have been made in the past. Hanae, Sir William Crookes, Moissan, and somebody in America. Didn't he succeed, Sir? Yes, Sir Dr. Hershey of Macpherson Cancers in 1924 made some perfect stones, very little ones but true diamonds. But how? By imitating nature. Diamonds are carbon in crystal form. Put carbon under enormous heat, cool it quickly under great pressure and diamonds result. Exactly how, only the man who made this stone can tell us. (eerie music) (machinery whirring) (dramatic music) There's a room here off my office you can use if you like. It's a bit small I'm afraid. It's fine. It's like my one at home. Ah, nice view of the river. Old father Thames. Yes, Sergeant? The young lady has just arrived, Inspector. Oh, ask her to sit down will you? I'm just going to interview a country woman of your. Come in if you like. Oh, thanks very much. Oh, by the way, my name's Hector. Mine's Joe. Hector? You mind if I call you Mac? I'd appreciate it. (door closes) Ah, Ms. Miller, it's good of you to come. I'm Inspector McClaren. How do you do, Inspector? And now maybe you can tell me what this is all about. Well, it's just a routine inquiry. Nothing to be alarmed about. You arrived in London last night, I believe. Yes, from America. I'm with Trans World Airlines. Yes, just transferred to their London office, eh? Why, yes. I came over here to be with my father. What's the matter, Inspector? Have I broken some regulation or something? Oh, no. As a matter of fact, it's your father that I wanted to talk to you about. He wasn't at home when you arrived last night? No, no, he wasn't. There's nothing wrong is there? No, but when a man of your father's importance disappears leaving no forwarding address, we naturally have to make inquiries. Oh, that. Dad's just a wee bit absent minded. Whenever he gets a problem or something, he just wanders off somewhere, goes fishing. Have you tried any of his favorite fishing haunts? Yes, all the lakes and rivers throughout the country, and I'm afraid we haven't had a single nibble. Cigarette? No, thank you. Your father had a great deal to do with the hydrogen bomb. Surely you don't think he's been kidnapped? No, but he is in possession of very vital secrets, Ms. Miller, and they'll certainly be relieved at tower when he turns up again. Until he does, I'm afraid I shall have to pester you a little. Oh, it won't be pestering, Inspector. But I'll try and not trouble you at your office, so I think it's far better if we keep this just to ourselves for the moment. I'll drop into your apartment one evening if I may? [Marline] Fine. [Mac and Marline] Goodbye. - Not that door. - Whoop, sorry. The next one. Marline! - Joe Dennison! - Well, what do you know? What in the world are you doing in England? Oh, chasing some poor man, I suppose? Yep, you're right, and don't think he's so poor either. Whose bank did you bust to get in here? What do you say you have dinner with me tonight? Like the last time in Santa Barbara? Oh, now that's not fair. When a guy works for Uncle Sam and Uncle sends him sudden travel orders. I wrote to you. Yes, two postcards. One from Chillicothe, Ohio of all places, and the other from the Canal Zone. You know what, Joe? I remember every tender word of each message. - You do? - Mm hm. They both said, "Hi," signed "Joe." Oh, well how much can a guy write on an open postcard? Come on, have dinner with me tonight and this time I'll be there. Sorry, Joe, but I'm spending the evening with Inspector McClaren. What? Oh, yes. Yes, of course. Call for me at seven will you, Inspector? Nice seeing you, Joe. Gum? No, thanks. I'm cutting out cigarettes. It helps, I think. Mm hm, that's why I stick to a pipe. Nice kid, isn't she? Lovely. She's not in any sort of a jam? No, her father's missing. Maybe it isn't anything serious, but they're worried stiff at (indistinct). Say, you seem to know her quite well. Well, not as well as I'd like to. See, I met her on a case while I was in California. Her father was there then. Oh, yes. But that was before he came to us. Mm hm. You know, he's an important man. He's got to be found. Nice looking old chap, isn't he? Nice guy, too. Well, Inspector, what do you say? Should we get started? Right away. I haven't got much, but what I've got is in here. When our undercover agent Mickey Sweeney was working on the Treasury Ball robbery, he ran across an English smuggler who was also trying to contact the thieves. Mickey posed as a go between. Smuggler found him out and killed him with an English pistol. - This one. - Hm, Webley .38. I'll send this over to the labs and they can do a ballistics test and see if it's on our record. Good. The local police surprised the killer, almost caught him, and he's flat he lost that gun. This is a photo stat of a thumbprint we found on the frame. Probably left there sometime when he cleaned it. And in his fight with Mickey, this contact lens. Mickey got in one good punch at least. Oh, brown uncorrected. That's right. Uncorrected for astigmatism, near sightedness or anything else. Disguise? Killer has mismatched eyes, one brown and one blue. He wore this brown one to even 'em up. And you managed to trace him through that? What makes you so sure he's over here? We picked up his trail in Mexico City and lost it, and we caught it again in Havana. He changed dollars into pounds, met another guy and they vanished. We figured the second fellow was a member of the vault cracking mob. Oh, with the Treasury money? That's right. Right now somewhere is our killer friend with the mismatched eyes and this other chap with a bag full of nice new United States currency. An English gun, an English smuggler who changed dollars into pounds. That makes sense. My hunch is they'd like to swap that dough for diamonds. Like the one you brought? Yeah. Yeah, like the one I brought. When Mickey had it clamped in his jaws. They had to pry open his... Have you got an extra bit of that gum? Thank you. This fellow Mickey, he was pretty close to you, eh? We played ball together all through college. He followed me into the service. He coulda had a crack at the big leagues, too. Well, those are the breaks, I guess. Hey, where's your gum? Oh, good Lord, I must've swallowed it. (Mac laughs) (Joe laughs) (shot firing) (analyst grunting) Ah, we've got the little monster's fingerprint. Let's see if we can find out what it's been up to. One day the first one I take out of there will be the right one. You hope. Let us know if you find anything. - Of course. - Immediately. (analyst sighs) Now we go and see what Sergeant Smith has dug up for us on gentlemen with odd eyes. - Good girl. - What girl? Smith. What? Smith's a girl? Good Lord, I suppose she is. There are only five suspects on file, Inspector, answering your description of a man with mismatched eyes. All right. Thank you. How about the fingerprint on the Webley? No, it doesn't match up with any of them. Oh. Could be a print of a former owner with no record. Hm, could be. Well, let's have a look at these fellows anyway. Well, this one's in Dartmoor, life sentence. Reported missing after the Battle of El Alamein. Oh, this fellow has one green and one yellow eye. Cat split. Well, at any rate he's safely away in Pentonville doing two years. Ah. "Smuggling, attempted murder. Present whereabouts unknown. No convictions for the past three years." It's a possible. "Karl Hunziger. Left eye brown, right eye blue. Folkston, 1946. Arrested trying to sparkle package of emeralds, fine and confiscation. 1947, South Hampton. Charged with smuggling diamonds, resisting arrest and illegal possession of firearm. Sentenced to three years penal servitude, released 1950." Sounds like one of these two could be our boy. Yes, at least it gives us a couple of suspects. Now, if that Webley has a record that ties in we'll know who we're after. Thank the lady. What? Thank the lady. Oh, thank you very much, Sergeant. Good day's work. Thanks. Let's hope the Webley has a very exciting past. I'd like a little excitement in the present. Where would a lonely man go to find it in jolly old London? I'm sorry, I wouldn't know. I have a date tonight, remember? That's right, so you have. You wouldn't happen to have Miss Miller's phone number handy would you? Just as handy as my memory. I'm sorry, it's against regulations to give away information that might put a witness in danger. Oh, I see. Under the circumstances, I think you better regard that information as strictly confidential. (Mac chuckles) (Joe chuckles) Goodbye, Mac. Goodbye, Joe. (gentle violin music) (gentle piano music) You like it? It's charming. I do wanna thank you for being such a good sport and backing me up today. I should thank you. But if you don't cheer up a little and smile a bit, I shall think you never want to have dinner with me again. I'm sorry. It's just that I've been thinking all afternoon about what you hinted, that maybe dad's been kidnapped. You've got me worried. Well, I didn't mean to. You say the most your father ever slipped away for was a week? A few days to a week. When did you see him last? On the ship when he left the States for England. Oh, waiter, there were only two of us. Who's the third one for? For little me. Delighted? Excited? Surprised? No. You've been doing a little shadowing, eh? So help me, Mac. I said food, the hotel porter said Soho and here I am. And I thought you'd given up smoking? Yeah, yeah, so I have. I suppose you carry them just to prove what a strong will you have? Well, if I couldn't feel a package in my pocket, it'd be worse. May I say, Ms. Miller, that you're looking very sharp tonight? I love that hat, if it is a hat. A very expensive one. That's a very nice broach, too. Thank you. I'm especially proud of it. Dad gave it to me. It's my birth sign, Pisces. He cut the stone himself. Your father cut it? Yes, it's his newest hobby. Where does he do this work? Oh, I don't know. He said in the letter he'd rented a garage somewhere. He's only taken it up in the last year or so. You can see how well he's doing. But dad's just one of those people. He's good at anything he tries. I agree with you entirely. Should we order dinner now? (alarms blaring) (pensive music) [Yeo] Can't you stop it? I don't know! That's what I'm trying to do. (dramatic music) You stupid fool! You have closed the exhaust vents! Do you want us all to be blown to bits? (music continues) If you ruined things you lout! Now take it easy, Mr. Yeo. - It's all right. - It had better be. And Hunziger almost here. If you clowned that- Take it easy. It's all right, I tell ya. Look! Your man is Karl Hunziger. The lab have tied him in with the gun that you brought over from the States. Just listen to this. "January the 1st, 1951. A bullet from this gun killed a Chinese restaurant owner, Lou Lee Lou, a known smuggler and informer." A happy know you to you all. Lou was the man who gave our customs officers information about Hunziger's attempt to smuggle in emeralds. The report goes on. "July, 1951. A bullet from the same gun wounded a police constable in attempted jewel robbery. The assailant escaped unidentified." Now at last we've got the gun, we'll get Hunziger. This I'm gonna enjoy. Here's a start. All right, all right, that'll do, Martin. Oh, hello Inspector. We're looking for Karl Hunziger. Karl? I haven't seen him in months. Honest, Inspector. But I'll let you know if I do. You better. Oh, of course, Inspector. Goodbye, Sir. (anticipatory music) I came to you as soon as I found this out, Inspector. The word around is Hunziger's not in the country. Is that all you found out? You know me, Inspector. I tell you me right age. I know it already. All right, you can go. Thanks, Inspector. Bye, Sir. Well, that's great. I'm right back where I started. You know, Joe, I think you're right about him coming over here, but I don't think he's here yet. What? [Mac] Well, it's a long way from Havana to London if you're coming by tramp steamer. Tramp steamer. Well, if you were in Havana and you wanted to sneak into another country, how would you go about it? Sure, I'd bribe passage on some crummy ship. Exactly. Yeah, but it's a long time since I lost him in Havana. Even if he's coming by row boat, he's getting close. What do I do now? I think you'd better see Commander Gilles of the Coast Guard. I'll have Smith take you over. Smith, will you come in here a minute? (boat horn blaring) And we have every reason to believe that he was coming by ship, Commander. Hm, he's no beauty is he? Well, we'll send out a description to all ports, notify all Coast Guard stations and patrol boats. It is very urgent, Commander. Certainly. But let me warn you, Mr. Dennison, that there's a lot of coastline, a lot of ocean and sometimes a lot of fog. Now, if you knew the name of the ship- - It would help. (phone ringing) Excuse me. Hello? Oh, yes. It's for you, Mr. Dennison. Yes? Oh, oh, hi, Mac. Yeah, well, what's up? Yes, yes, we're just about finished here. All right, I'll come over right away. I'm sorry, Commander. That's all right, go ahead. Thanks very much. Hello? Gilles here. Send out a priority message, all ports, Coast Guard stations and patrols. We're expecting an attempt at the illegal landing of the following man. Karl Hunziger, 511 1/2". Right eye blue, left eye brown. Yes, that's right. Weight's 14 stone, age about 40. Dark brown hair, thinning. And you're sure Sam, there can be no possible error? No doubt, Sir. Hi, Mac. What's up? I found Dr. Miller's workshop. Well, did you get a lead on where he is? Possibly. Oh, Sam, this is Mr. Dennison who I spoke to you about. Sam's with our fingerprint department. You go ahead, Sam, and tell him. I've been working with you, Mr. Dennison, behind the scenes so to speak, running a check on the fingerprints your people found on the Webley pistol. You no doubt noticed the small scar that disfigures the central Delta. Makes quite a pretty picture. But today, examining Dr. Miller's workshop for Inspector McClaren, in addition to Dr. Miller's own fingerprints, I found the same scar print twice. - Thanks. - Certainly, Sir. Thank you. What do you think? I hate to think. Still, I had some such thought the first time I saw Marline's broach. Yeah, yeah, me too. All seems fairly obvious now. Nuclear heat and fuels expert suddenly takes up laboratory work and then disappears. - And then the diamonds. - Yes. Anything else that ties him in, Mac? The print on the gun that killed your friend in the United States, and the same print here in Miller's workshop. I'd say he's tied in pretty tight. No, Mac, look, these prints don't tie Dr. Miller in with the phony diamonds. Supposing he just met this guy through a mutual hobby, wanted to show him his workshop. Maybe they got the- Joe, Joe, I know how you feel. You know, I like the girl too. There's a chance I can prove it tonight. One way or the other. (clock chiming) Good evening. Joe! I'm sorry, I'm late but at the last minute we had to get on an extra flight. Oh, I'm glad businesses are good. Shall we go? Like this? Oh I'll can't, I'm not dressed. Well, you better get off the street then. You'll cause a scandal. Come on in with me while I change. Oh! It'll only take a minute. [Joe] Where have I heard that before? Bills. Nothing from your father? No, the last news I had was in a letter to New York just before I came over. Having anything yet, Joe? No, no, not that I know of. About this letter, do you have it? Not with me. It's coming in a trunk with a lot of other stuff I couldn't bring on the plane. Oh, I see. Did you tell this to McClaren? No, I just this minute remembered it. Is it important? Can you recall what was in it? Well, dad never writes much. All he said was, "Have a good time, say hello to all our friends." And then he said, "I sometimes feel I'd like to come back and see the flowers again.” He meant the camellias that grow all around our cottage out there in Oak Ridge. He loves them. That's about all. I see. I'll go get dressed now. There was one other thing. He said he'd met a man who raised camellias, a great ugly brute of a man, and that he won prizes with him. Well, you should have told this to Mac, we might have something. Well, I don't see what that- - Are you sure that he used the phrase, "Met a man?" Yes, yes, I'm sure he did. Well, that could only mean a recent acquaintance if we can find this camellia fancier. Then he might tell us something about Dad. Yeah, yeah, he might. Well, I'll tell Mac about it in the morning. Let's try and find this flower lover tonight, Joe. - Oh, look- - Please. The waiting, the not knowing, I've tried to make myself think it isn't anything, but I just can't take it any longer. All right, now you go on in and change and we'll give it a whirl. (dial spinning) Information, please. Information? Yeah, I want a telephone number. Oh, oh. Directory inquiries. Thank you. Hello, directory inquiries? Have you a listing for a camellia growers association or a camellia society, something like that? Yes, camellias, flowers, that's right. Yes, I'll hold on. It'll be a pleasure. Just take your time. (beer sloshing) (patrons chattering) [Woman] Jolly good, jolly good. - Well done. - Yay! (chattering continues) I certainly hope this is it. All the man at the Camellia Society said was that he thought a fell like that ran a pub some place in Chelsea. (sighs) Now I know why they call it pub crawling. And farther and I'd have to. Let's sit down and have a drink here anyway. Mr. Yeo? Hm? That girl just come in, Miller's daughter. Where? In the saloon bar with a tall fella. Mm hm. I'll go and have a word with 'em. Well, take it easy. Look. Everything all right? [Man] Yes, thanks very much. Ah, Bill, haven't seen you in for a long time. - Oh, thank you- - Oh, yes, it's him all right. Real bull elephant, isn't he? He looks like he might be coming over here. If he does, you ask him about your father. Being attended to? Well, no as a matter of fact. You're Americans, aren't you? I could always tell. Get quite a number around here looking around, you know? Enjoying your visit? Oh yes, yes, very much. Business or pleasure? My business is always a pleasure. Oh (chuckles), that's good, that's capital. You know, I must remember that one. That's worth a drink on the house anytime. What'll you have? Thank you, gin and tonic, please. I'll have a beer, cold please. We were admiring your flowers. Oh, these (chuckles)? Camellia japonica, formal, full double (indistinct). Hm, my, my. You'd never know, would you? Raise them yourself? I do, Sir. [Marline] They're beautiful. Yes, took second prize at Chelsea Flower Show last year with some just like that. You know, when I was a youngster, I used to be a bit of a weight lifter. Now I raise camellias. So a man changes. My father wrote me how much he admired your flowers. Your father? Yes, a Dr. Miller. I believe he's a friend of yours. Dr. Miller. Well, I probably wouldn't know his name. That's the thing we're most discreet about in public houses over here in England, even with regular customers. Well, I'll go and get your drinks. [Joe] Thank you, Mr. Yeo. How did you know my name? I saw it painted on your door lintel. "T. Yeo, licensed to sell beer and spirits to be consumed on the premises." You have very sharp eyes. Thank you. How can you stand it, this running into stone walls? I've got a very thick skull, but you mustn't get discouraged. That's one of the first things that a detective has to learn is not to discourage easily. About anything. Am I by any chance being pursued? By comparison, Little Eva was a piker. (gentle music) No more sudden travel orders, Joe. No more sudden travel orders. Least not tonight. (music continues) In here Mr. Dennison, we shan't be disturbed. Thank you. Sit down, won't you? [Joe] No, thanks. Well, I'm at your service. What can I do for you? Do you recall the diamond that you examined the other day at Scotland Yard? I do. Yes, I do indeed. It was a very fine stone. If you saw another of the same sort, I mean one exactly like it, do you think you could recognize it? Mr. Dennison, in your profession, you're trained amongst other things to remember faces by the little things you see in them. A mole, a scar, weakness perhaps, or strength. In short, character. Well, it's the same in my field. That stone had character, very strong character. Some of which I confess baffled me not a little, but because of that very fact, the answer to your question is yes. I think I could recognize a similar stone very easily. Yes, Mr. Dennison, this stone is essentially the same as the one you showed me at Scotland Yard. Same unusual depth of color, same striations. In fact, I should say it is an identical stone. Something wrong, Mr. Dennison? Have I perhaps given you bad news? Yes. Yes, a matter of fact, Mr. Blake, you have. Oh, well. Thanks anyhow. Not at all. Not at all. If you ever come across one like it for sale, you'll let me know won't you? If there's ever one like that for sale, you'll know. The main stone is the same as the other one, Inspector. Synthetic, same fine quality. I see. Thank you. Sorry I held out on you, Mac. Oh, forget it. In your shoes I'd have probably handled it the same way. So, what do we tell Marline? "Don't worry about your father. He's not dead or hasn't been kidnapped. He's just a crook.” Is that what we tell her? It's tough, I admit. Excuse me, Sir. Here's the enlargement you asked for. Ah. Hey, Dr. Miller, isn't it? I must confess, I've been holding out on you a bit too. This is an enlargement of a candid photo taken of Dr. Miller by a street photographer. I found it in the pocket of his smock when I was searching his workshop. He'd stated about four days before he disappeared. What about the photographer? Have we found him yet? No, Sir. Unfortunately, he's casual work and he's moved on. Well, don't worry about him. Just find a door front like this with a comic knocker. But this is a Georgian house. If all the houses in London with Georgian door fronts and brass knockers were laid end to end- - It would look sort of ridiculous. (Mac chuckles) But still, it is an idea. Have them try all the district's Georgian houses, Helban, Bloomsbury, Hampstead. Try and locate this gargoyle knocker. Very good, Sir. - Oh, Smith? - Yes, Sir? Thank you very much. Thank you, Sir. Oh yes, there was one other little thing I found. Some indentations on a pad. You did? Yes, looked like doodling. I'm having the lab bring it up for reading with the IDing fumer. You'll be sure to let me know what it says won't you, Inspector? But of course. You know, there are two things that bother me. Only two? Yes, one, how you went about getting this broach in the first place and two, how you intend to go about giving it back. They both bother me, too. Hello, Inspector. How's it going? You find your Dr. Miller? No, but we have found his old workshop in London. Have you had any luck with those impressions I sent you on that pad? Whoever wrote on the sheet above this had a very heavy hand. Let's try the IDing fumer. The spray should settle in the indentations all right. Anyhow, we'll soon know. (fumes hissing) There's something coming up. That's all right. "Tomaszow. Tomaszow." Well, who or what the devil is that? Tomaszow? And your fare will be 313 pounds. You may have this if you like? Thank you. Good day. Hello. Anything I can do for you? You're not planning on leaving us? No, not yet. And I'm afraid I'm all alone. I've come in to ask you, is this your father's handwriting? No, no it isn't. Well, has your father ever mentioned a man called Tomaszow? Tomaszow? Tomaszow. No, I'm sure he hasn't, but I have seen the word somewhere before. Wait! Tomaszow. It's a city in Central Poland. I knew I'd seen it somewhere before. It's a stop for Polish National Airlines. Hm. What does it mean? Does it concern Dad? Well, that's what I was hoping you could tell me. Is there any word yet? No, no, not yet. When there is, you will let me know right away won't you, Inspector? Course, of course we will. Good day. (bell ringing) Just a minute. - Hi. - Hello, Joe. Hm! Well, that was hardly worth waiting for. Better. (chuckles) Say, you know, the darnedest thing got into me. I don't know what's matter with me. I must be losing my mind. Look. My clip. - I missed it. - Yeah. I've been looking all over for it. How did you get it? Oh, I don't know. I just picked it up. You just picked it up? Mm hm, yeah. You know, I probably picked it up, looked at it and stuck it in my pocket, sort of absent minded. I don't know what kind of a mind you've got Joe, but it isn't that kind. There's something going on I don't know about and I don't like it. What were the police doing at my father's workshop the other day? Oh, that was nothing, Marline. The woman next door told me all about. And today Inspector McClaren asking me a lot of questions about some city in Poland. I wanna know what's going on, Joe. I've got a right to know. Yes, I guess you have. All right, Marline. Scotland Yard don't think your father's disappeared. They think he's mixed up in some kind of a phony diamond operation. Stone in this clip's of phony. They think there's a lot more like it. You believe that? Well, I can't and yet- - And yet you stole my clip to make sure it was a fake, and involved my father in some dirty business. Well, my father isn't that kind of a man. Oh, Marline, I told you. You've told me enough. Why didn't ya ask me for it, Joe? Why did you have to pretend to make love to me to get it? [Joe] Marline, I wasn't pretending. Get out of here. (pensive music) (dramatic music) (engine rumbling) Don't try and get up. You're hurt. I'll fetch a doctor. No, no, just gimme a hand. Oh! If you'll help me get a cab, there's a doctor at my hotel. No registration number, no description of the driver, nothing? No, no luck. I'd say you were a very lucky man, Mr. Dennison. No broken bones, just a few minor knocks and bruises. Here, take one of these every four hours if you feel any pain. Thank you. You'll probably feel a little stiff in the morning, that's all. Well, goodnight. Goodnight, Doc. - Goodnight. - Thanks for coming down. (doctor coughs) Must do something about that cold. Does this mean anything to you? "Tomaszow." Is that the city in Poland that Marline spoke to me about? Oh, so she mentioned it, eh? Among other things. This was the indentation I found on the pad in Dr. Miller's office. Oh. (Mac blows) Well, take it easy, Joe. I'll see you in the morning. Of course, this attempt on your life means they probably know why you're over here. It also means they haven't made their deal yet, but will soon. Goodnight. Goodnight, Mac. (Joe sighs) (machine whirring) (pensive music) (indistinct) No good. Full of carbon spots. What's the matter, Doctor? The first stones you made were perfect. These are useless. Go back to your first formula. What was it? I have forgotten. [Yeo] You're lying, Dr. Miller. Yes, because I don't trust you anymore, Yeo. When we started this work, we agreed to sell the stones for what they are, synthetics for radar or electronics. But now- - Don't be simple. We can make 10 times the money by passing them off as natural diamonds. That's one of the things I don't like. [Yeo] What else don't you like? Once we were partners, now I'm a prisoner. I'm watched, and that too I don't like. Listen to this. There's a million dollars on its way here. Did you hear that, Dr. Miller? A million dollars. All for a measly handful of our stones. It's a profit to all of us of over 300,000 pounds. Now, do you think I'm gonna let you sabotage our work? I'll kill you first. Well? - He missed him. - I missed him? He heard us! Oh, I should have known better than to trust fools like you. Yeah, but listen, I'll tell ya- - Oh, get outta my way, I'm busy. I asked you a question. What was in your first formula? What was in it is in here. Here it stays. If you have it, you don't need me and I am dead. I do not cooperate with criminals, Mr. Yeo. You will from now on. Read him the clipping. "Miss Marline Miller, daughter of the eminent nuclear physicist, Dr. Eric Miller arriving at London Airport last night from New York." (unsettling music) [Yeo] Now Doctor, for her peace of mind, will you be sensible? You wouldn't harm my daughter? No? You don't think so? Now, will you run another batch? How many more do we need? I don't know, I'll have a look. Meeting with Hunziger is all set for tomorrow night. Can we make it? The last stones will have to go uncut. So they go uncut. Go and get them started for another run. I'll go and see the boss now and tell him his little scheme with the clipping worked. "Tomaszow, city in Poland, southeast of Lodz. Population, 20,257 named after General Thaddeus Tomaszow, Polish national hero. Named after a man. Let's get basic. What other things are named after men? Monuments, buildings, bridges, the George Washington Bridge. Tombstones. Dams, Hoover Dam. Cocktails, Tom Collins. Roman cars. Manor houses, libraries, ships. Ships, Mac! [Mac] The Lloyd's register. [Joe] How many of them are named after people? Hundreds! S.S. Tomaszow, Polish registry... [Joe and Mac] Gilles! Let's get him over here right away. (boat horn blaring) (pail clanging) (seagulls squawking) (pensive music) (waves splashing) Uh, uh, mustn't touch. Oh, it'll be ours soon enough. Just as soon as we get the stones. (groans) Lousy stinkin' ship. (bell clanging) What time was that? Time have you stop complaining and get your things packed. I got everything packed right here that interests me. Yeah, mind you're careful with that when we get over the site. (chuckles) Me drop a million bucks in the drink? Not a chance. What is it, Sergeant? [Sergeant] Gortmouth is trying to contact Commander Gilles, Sir. [Gortmouth] This is Gortmouth. Gortmouth calling Commander Gilles, London. Come in, Gortmouth. Over. [Gortmouth] The Tomaszow was logged past here at 08:10 hours here this morning. Tried to contact her by wireless. She has not replied. Over. Thank you, Gortmouth. Over and out. She's got no clearance for any UK port. She may not have any clearance, but she'll hit the coast of England somewhere, that's for sure. Where's Smith? Why isn't she here? I'm sorry, Sir, she's gone off duty. Off duty? Well, get somebody in here. Well, what do we do now? We wait. Well, we've got a lot of practice at that. (man speaking in foreign language) Must mean us. - Yeah. - Come on. [Ormesby Coast Guard] Ormesby here, calling Commander Gilles, over. Gilles here, come in Ormesby. - [Ormesby Coast Guard] - Tomaszow is still off the coast, Sir. Barely keeping steerage way. I got beach patrols out. Very fowl weather here. Hold on a moment. Where's Ormesby? North of Great Yarmouth. Well, thank you Smith for coming in. (waves splashing) (seagulls squawking) (anticipatory music) (music intensifies) (engine revving) Is everything okay? Beach Patrol 3 calling. [Ormesby Coast Guard] Ormesby calling. Ormesby calling. The Tomaszow landed two men in a small boat. They went through the dunes. They were met by a man in a Jaguar car. Registration number believed to be NLC 589. Our patrol was on foot, so sorry this was the best they could do. What direction did they take? What direction did they take. - [Ormesby Coast Guard] - South toward Lowestoft. Phone, please. Thank you, Ormesby. Sorry you had such rotten luck. Information room? Put this out immediately. All stations Lowestoft area, be on the lookout for a Jaguar saloon car containing three men, registration number NLC 589. On contact call McClaren, Scotland Yard. That's all, thank you. Anything else I can do? [Mac] No thank you, Commander. You've done your part. Well, good luck. (engine rumbling) 5D calling, 5D calling Scotland Yard. You requested information, gray Jaguar, registration number NLC 589. Just passed us traveling south. Lowestoft, Ipswich Road. Out. What's the code letter for Fox & Hounds in his area? R for Robert. Put Operation Fox & Hounds, R for Robert into effect immediately. Fox & Hounds, what's that? Well, it's a plan we have for locating any car in England. [Officer] 7X calling. Will car with telescopic ladder report- - Take that man off the air, this is priority. Yes, Sir. [Officer] Occupier has mislead- - [Officer] Calling Inspector McClaren. We're on a side road, Sir. Off the Lowestoft Road near Bentley Heath. Good. Now, you're Fox & Hounds 1. The Jaguar is about- - Two miles. Two miles away from you, approaching you from the direction of Lowestoft. Pick up and follow. Follow? Mac, move in and grab 'em. No, if we do that and they'll just keep their trap shut and we won't get anything out of them. Leave 'em alone and they'll lead us to what we want, and I want the whole works. And I want the guy that bumped off Mickey Sweeny. We can't take a chance on losin' him now. Joe, I shall have to run this my own way. Yeah, yeah, I guess you will at that, Mac. (engine rumbling) [Officer] Fox & Hounds 1 calling Inspector McClaren. Fox & Hounds 1 calling Inspector McClaren. Come in, Fox & Hounds 1. We've picked up the Jaguar, Sir. It's heading south along the Lowestoft and Ipswich Road. We're following. Keep well back. Don't alarm them. They tell me to give you this. What's that, your new eye? Yep. Hey, hard just walkin' around like this. Ah, shut up. (Hoxie laughs) I think it's time we pulled out, number 1. McClaren calling Fox & Hounds 2. Evan's here, Inspector. [Mac] Are you in position yet? Over. Just got here, Inspector. The Duke of York, public house on the road to Whitham. Over. You are Fox & Hounds 2, Evans, replacing green Morris saloon. When it drops out, you'll take over. Right, Inspector. Over and out. [Officer] You will drop out at the Duke of York Public House on Witham Road. 2 is taking over. Report back to me. Very good, Sir. Did you get that? What's the matter? It's nothing. I had a feeling we were being followed. It's all right, he pulled into that pub back there. (engines rumbling) [Evans] We are still in position behind the Jaguar. Evans has been on them 16 miles now, Sir. [Mac] Oh, thanks. McClaren to Fox & Hounds 3. This is Fox & Hounds 3 reporting. Sergeant Graves here, Sir. Ready to take over. Thank you, Sergeant Graves. You will start as soon as the Jaguar has passed you and will take over from the (indistinct). Pretty neat. (engines rumbling) It came this afternoon while you were out and I asked the man to bring it up here and do you know, I thought he would never get it 'round that bend in the stair. It's a very tricky turning, you know, and you- (Marline sighs) What's the matter, my dear? Nothing, Mrs. Sayer. I'm looking for a packet of letters. I'm sure they're here somewhere. Now isn't that a queer thing? Do you know, I lost a letter myself last week and I searched this house from top to bottom, and you know where I found it? (engine rumbling) Ashley, calling Inspector McClaren. I'm in the outskirts of East London. Well, they're holding to a steady 30 miles an hour. (chuckles) Evidently don't want any trouble with the police, Sir. (horn honking) (tires squealing) Come on! You look where you're going. (girl speaking faintly) (engine rumbling) [Ashley] Calling Inspector McClaren, Inspector McClaren, urgent. Come in, number 7. [Ashley] I'm in Arrow Street south of Bow Road. I've lost them. Lost them? (operators chattering) Put out a general call, all stations London area. Pick up Jaguar saloon car, registration number NLC 589. Car last seen Arrow Street and Bow Road. [Operator] M2GW general call. - Calling all stations. - General call. Pick up Jaguar car NLC 589. Last seen... (door creaking) Mr. Yeo, Sir. Look at them. Aren't they beautiful? $1,000,000 worth of little gleaming pebbles. (inquisitive music) Magnificent. Proof that a dream can come true. My dream that one day a man would conquer this secret, and the fact that I control the secret makes it worthwhile, doesn't it? Dr. Miller may have something to say about that. I've made some arrangements to take care of him. Well, we mustn't keep our American friend waiting. I'll see you back here. Good luck. Very nice. (dial spinning) Oh now, this is very pretty. 5th Avenue, well, well. Scotland Yard. Is Inspector McClaren there, please? He isn't? Well, is the American, Mr. Dennison there? Oh, this is Marline Miller. Will you tell "em when they come in that I have something very important for them and I'm on my way over now? Thank you. Thanks, Mrs. Sayer. Thanks a lot. Scotland Yard? Well, well. (pensive music) (music intensifies) Oh! Help! (Marline yells) Help! Oh! Help, someone! Help! Help! (tires squealing) Hold the line a minute. Tell that to Inspector McClaren. Hold on. Inspector McClaren, Sir, call for you. McClaren here. Police Constable Wilkens, St. John's Wood reporting, Inspector. The Jaguar car, license number NLC 589 is parked at the corner of Thomas Avenue and Queville Road unoccupied. They found the car. Good work, Wilkens. We'll be with you right away. If anyone comes back for it before we get there just, well, kick up a bit of fuss about parking, detain them and don't scare them, got it? Let's get moving. Get me a report on that Constable Wilkens. (soft music) (patrons chattering) Been parked here quite a time haven't you, Sir? (men grunting) (fists thudding) The call box he used is down the next street. Turn right at the crossing, driver. (shot firing) Step on it. (alarm ringing) Police! Come on! (shot firing) (fist thudding) Hold it, Hunziger. Just come to papa. Don't shoot, I'm not armed. Don't tempt me. (shot firing) (Hunziger groans) (escalator creaking) (pensive music) I'd like to throw 'em all over London. Joe, I'll have to impound your gun as evidence. You'll be needed at the inquest, of course. For him, it'll be a pleasure. [Susie] Smith to C19. Inspector McClaren? Come in, Sergeant. McClaren here. [Susie] They found the house with the gargoyle knocker, Sir. 8 St. Johns Wood Lane. Good work, Susie. You heard her. I've got it. Everything went as smooth as silk. Well, then we'd better get out and feed the hungry mobs. Seems a pity, doesn't it? (engine rumbling) Police. Out the back way. Leave the lights. (knocker banging) Come on. We'd better go this way. I'm only a servant, Sir. I don't know anything. So you've told us at every opportunity. Find anything? His passport. Are you sure you can't open this? No, Sir. Mr. Blake's the only one that touches that. Nothing here. Let's go. When the fingerprint boys get here, have them give the place a good dusting, especially the handle of that safe. Very good, Sir. Hello? Hello operator? Operator, I was talking to Washington D.C. I've lost my connection. Yes, that's right. What- Hello chief? Yes, yes, that's much better. It's a Minneapolis mob. Same gang did the Denver job. You can move in and get 'em. What's that? I can't hear you, Chief. Yes, yes, Hoxie named 'em all. No, no, he doesn't know a thing about the setup over here. As a matter of fact we're stumped. Right, right. Sir? The lab have just rung through. The fingerprints on the Webley revolver and those in Dr. Miller's workshop are Blake's. Blake. Get his description on the air, and have them hold him for questioning it. - Inspector? - I can't see anybody now. But it's kidnapping, Sir. I found him knocked out in Hampstead. Said he picked up a fare, a young lady, and two thugs set about it. Yes, and she just asked me to drive her in, Governor. That's why I brought him along. Well, have him make out his report to the duty officer. Very good, Sir. Wait a minute! Isn't that Marline's handbag? It is. What happened to her? The two men took her away in a car. Well, did you get the make, the registration number? He didn't know, he was partly unconscious. - Oh. - All right, well, see he's looked after. Very good, Sir. Come on, I'll give you a cup of tea. (speaks indistinctly) Joe, he said she was trying to come here. She must have found out something. - But what? - (bag contents clattering) This is the letter from her father that she told me about. Got to find her. There's nothing new here. It isn't even dated. How about the post mark on the envelope? Mac, Mac, this wasn't mailed from London. It's mailed from a place called Springwell in Kent. And it's dated four days after he disappeared. This is what she was going to tell me. We've gotta try it, Mac, it's our only chance. McClaren here, get me a car and two men immediately. You see, Dr. Miller, there isn't very much time, so I hope you're not going to be obstinate. All you have to do is to tell me the ingredients of your formula. No, I told you before, you have that and I am dead. And you won't tell me? No. I think you will. (Blake's fingers snapping) (pensive music) (dramatic music) Dad! Marline! (Eric gasping) [Marline] Oh, no! No! (fist thudding) (Marline groaning) Tell them to stop. (Marline sobs) The base was gum arabic- - Just a minute, I wanna write this down. Gum arabic. Solvent 996, pure galvanized iron filings. (engine rumbling) Heat range, 5,700 degrees centigrade, 67 minutes. Well, that seems to be all right. Thank you, Dr. Miller. You know, I was beginning to doubt your reputation for intelligence. [Eric] We can leave now my daughter and I, we can go? Of course, shortly. I just have to arrange how you'll go, you're a much wanted man. Besides, we must run a little test on your formula. I'd like to make sure. His name is Miller. Are you sure you hadn't seen him in the village or the neighborhood? Never seen him. Well, what about this man? No, nor him neither. Anybody doing any research? A new factory, anything like that? Not that I know of. If we're on a wild goose chase- - We're too late. Any places around here empty, abandoned? Plenty, Sir. Several farms, an old ruin castle, a bombed out brewery. Utilities! Mac, if they'd open up one of these old places, they'd need power. Where's the electricity out? Right down the street, Sir. Fine. Excellent. All right, tell the others to come in. Right. Shan't keep you much longer, Ms. Miller. You gave your word we could go. Just a few more details to attend to, Doctor, and so on. (objects crashing) (door rattling) (door bangs) There they are. In the cabinet. Cottage. Oh, don't bother about small parts. Just try the big places. Righto, Sir. Brewery. No, it's not the brewery. Well, what about the old ruined castle? Saint Vivian's. Saint Vivian's. Right. There we are. Yes, it is! Look at the size of this- - Get your constable and show us the way. Right, Sir. Where's Yeo? He thought he'd better move the cars. Well. Dr. Miller, I'm sorry we have to say goodbye. (suitcase latches clicking) Gentlemen? Empty! (door closes) (pensive music) (men yelling) (fists pounding) What are you up to? Why you- Wait a minute. Even a million can look pretty small if you divide it too many ways. Where is the money? Come with me. (dramatic music) (glass shatters) There you are. What about the others? (electricity whirring) (suspenseful music) The chair, quick! (chair banging) [Yeo] We'd better get out of here before the whole place blows up. Yes. (shot firing) (music continues) Joe, Joe over here! This seems to lead inside. (dramatic music) (flames whooshing) Look out! (shots firing) Mac! Mac! Use my gun! Joe! (Marline's fist pounding) Joe! Joe! (shot firing) Joe! Joe! [Joe] Marline! Yes, yes, Joe! I... (dramatic music) Dad, Dad! Joe, he's hurt! Get your father out of here. (music continues) (flames whooshing) (shots firing) (pensive music) (shot firing) (dramatic music) (flames whooshing) (bag thudding) Easy. Take it easy, he's been shot. Thanks, Joe. Joe, you can't go back in there. You mustn't. The whole place will blow up any second now. (dramatic music) (foot thudding) Help, help! Help! Help! (music intensifies) (castle explodes) (Marline screams) (Mac exhaling) (pensive music) Joe, the money. What happened to the money? It was new currency, Mac, unissued. Burning it up is just as good as recovering it. (soft triumphant music)
