"Education, which is the right of all and duty of the State and of the family, shall be promoted and fostered with the cooperation of society with a view to the full development of the person, and preparation for the exercise of citizenship and qualification for work." Constitution of Brazil, article 205. I want to be an adult- child-youngster-teenager. I don't want to be a youngster, I wish I could go straight to adulthood. I think I live in a dream world. I'm a manufacturing defect. That's who I am. I'm different from everybody else. Death is my only certainty. So I have to do everything I want to do while I still have the chance to breathe, to live. When they took my dreams away from me, I gave up my dreams, too. I want you to come out of your shell and grow up. It feels like a storm and I don't think it's a coincidence that the first philosophic movement to define youth and adolescence as a decisive life stage PSYCHOANALYST was called "Sturm und Drang": "Storm and Thunder". These great cloud masses start building up, which is a bit like what happens in our bodies, in our own life experience, our sense of self changes, and, from time to time, it triggers a kind of lightning, a kind of connection between two worlds: the world of air and the world of land. It's this force that we feel, this power. AGE 16 STORM AND THUNDER When I was a child, I really wanted to be of age. Like, I was dying to be a teenager already. I thought it was something like, "Oh, I'm going to be free now." AGE 17 I wanted to own the world. I thought it was all easy. So when I realized it wasn't anything like that... AGE 17 I was a bit frustrated. We have to leave our mothers' arms and make a living, face the world. AGE 21 It feels like the world is about to fall on our heads. Some days I feel so happy, but some days I'm like: AGE 17 "Lord, why is this happening to me?" Adolescence is a difficult moment to live through. - But it's unforgettable, too. - It is. I'm a person many people would call crazy, many people would say I'm many things. And I say I'm all of these things. AGE 18 Like, it's difficult to build your own identity. AGE 17 If I spend a lot of time with Júnior, then, soon enough, I'll be doing whatever his doing? In my opinion, I don't think adults should look at young people AGE 16 and try to understand, like: "He's young, what do I do?" You have to be fun and mess around. Do you want to get married and have children? What do you like? What do you want to work with? You have to drink and be that laid-back kid, you have to hook up with all the girls. AGE 20 It's hard for me to make friends. AGE 15 I don't feel good around people I don't know. I love the crowd following me, don't I? I like the masses. I love roughhousing, the night life. I'm a teenager now, I'm smart, I'm in my best shape, living my best moment. I want to go out and have fun. AGE 17 I think we're moved by curiosity, by our desire to do things. AGE 19 At 15, you want to be a lawyer. At 16, you want to travel the world. You change your mind very fast, you change your musical taste very fast. You start owning your life, you change, you evolve. AGE 16 I don't know what I want to do with my life anymore! I like so many things and I want to do a lot things, but I don't know where to begin. AGE 17 It takes me hours to make any decision in my life. And, sometimes, I don't make any. AGE 16 Because I can't. I'm too indecisive. I think kids these days need to be more objective. Young people say: "I want to do this." "No, I don't want that anymore." When I make up my mind, it stays made up. That's how it is with most kids here. AGE 16 I've always wanted to be an interior designer, but now that I'm grown, I want to go to Law School. I considered a degree in P.E., then Biology, then Economy, Journalism. ANTHROPOLOGIST Experimentation is at stake, the possibility to experiment with things. Taking risks is part of being young. It's part of this moment in life, the life cycle. It's a space of great intensity, which is always bordering rupture. Of course you live the intensity of this possible rupture a lot more than it effectively happens. ECONOMIST There's no rite of passage among Indigenous peoples and particularly the Baniwa, without, for example, suffering and pain, because we understand these are necessary to face life. INDIGENOUS TEACHER The way I see it, high school is basically a rite of passage in white people's world. We look at the world and see, and find out, that the world is a stage, that people don't speak their minds, they don't do what they want to do and there are miserable lives. So, in the face of this spectacle, you get fascinated, you're bitten by a passion of the real. What is worthwhile? What would you give your life for? We're millions in this world. Dispersed beings. Loves, temptations, we get carried away by moments. Cherish hearts, warm whoever is near you. For some, a dollar sign counts the most, but do bank notes make you smarter? As for me, I prefer other crowds, words, solfeggios, verbs. Life is made of lessons. Calm down your soul and learn with time. Then you'll see your worries will be gone with the wind. There are so many dreams, so many ideas, THEATER DIRECTOR, WRITER AND FILMMAKER but very few people listening to make them come true. People often think everything is just a phase for the youth, AGE 19 that our opinion is just a phase. No, it's not. It's my opinion and you've got to respect it. AGE 17 There's no dialogue, they never ask us what we think in school. Kids are very angry. There's so much angst, you know? And there's so much we want to say, but we can't. We feel we're going to explode. AGE 19 Here we are, we have the right to speak up and to choose and we can change things around us. POET They don't want to be "the other" anymore. Even when we ask: "What's your future?" we're treating them as the other, as if the youth weren't present in what we're building right now. So I see a huge desire and a claim for taking part in what's happening now. How can we think schools, public schools, high schools, not just as a passage, but as reality, where things happen? Things that can change society, that can enrich both kids and adults. I believe the youth can go further, they are free to make up their own narrative, to walk around the city, make up a place for themselves. Let the youth make up the world. Can we say every Brazilian youth has the same opportunities? Of course not. So, we'll always talk about "youths". There are "Brazilian youths". The youth can dream. But who exactly can dream? Who's the youth who has the time to dream? PROF. JOSÉ DE SOUZA MARQUES STATE SCHOOL To wake up and make plans? He's daily life is laid out before him. He's got to wake up and go to school all the way to the other side of town. My life, for instance, could be a movie. A tragedy movie. AGE 15 A movie. It's all influenced by my race, but also by my culture. I'm black, I still live in a small town, I didn't go to a very good school. And all these things I've just said... AGE 18 won't let me have a shot at a better place. We're scared of the future. How can we secure our space, how can we work if there are not enough jobs? When will it be better, when will it be our turn? AGE 16 Will there be anything left for us? I've never tried to outdo no one I just show my talent to those who have The will to improve, so listen to the beat and come With an open heart and show your zen side I'm the top dweller of this parallel universe... WANTED Based upon reality I build my own castle I'm tired of being a joke and all this pain That's why I want it, bro, how I want it You tell me to look ahead I don't see a thing That's that. I think the idea of meritocracy is great, but it's also a great excuse not work some problems out. They set up a race to get to the top of the building, but the guy starts from the 5th floor and I'm at the underground. Plus, he takes the elevator. WRITER For the most vulnerable, less favored youth, childhood gets shortened. So they play less. They're harassed by the imminence of having to work early in life. They have a strongly instrumental relationship with learning and education. That is, they learn for something. They learn an activity, a craft, for a job. They learn the simplest version of things, they learn without ambition. This compression of childhood and adolescence produces what appears to be the main psychological sequel, which is the shortening of dreams. This is worse than offering inequitable opportunities; this is killing the future. I basically live with no guarantee of tomorrow. So I don't expect much, I try to plan something for my life, but no great expectations, you know? The only opportunity I've had, like... -I think, I don't know... AGE 21 I mean, I've never had any opportunities, you know? It's tough, right? I'm 18, sophomore, trying to finish school. Looking for a job when they ask for CVs and we don't know what to offer. Then we have to pay for prep courses and money is short. So it's hard to tell what will be of us. AGE 18 It feels like gambling. It's stressful to watch them PROF. JOÃO LOYOLA MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOL waiting for these opportunities, because for each of these possibilities, they always have to go through a selection process. And "being selected" also makes it stressful. Not just for them, but for me as well, as their teacher. If you restrict what the youth can see, you're impoverishing the country, the future, the society. Because that's exactly the phase when possibilities arise, desires, the hunger for knowledge, that's when they might want to have access to cultural assets. Poors, slum-dwellers and blacks are on the bench. What gets you in the game is reading and studying. There's nothing else. THE KEY I have great affection for my 5th grade teacher. That woman has no idea the change she made in me when she said: "Keep at it!" And she put a cute note on my notebook, which I still have. That made all the difference to me. It was that notebook in my neighborhood school that made me say: "Yeah, poetry's cool. That's what I want to do." Education has this intrinsic value. It's beautiful to see someone thinking, it's beautiful to see someone learning. It's a gateway to a thousand other rights. Without education, you can't secure your right to health care, or your political rights, because you don't understand the society you live in, you don't understand yourself. ECONOMIST I've always seen education and school as fundamental tools for freedom. Not just to secure the continuity of our present values, but to make it possible to build new values, new and improved life possibilities. Getting somewhere where you have the key to open these doors is very scary, because it's a kind of power. You realize when a politician steps on his platform and starts lying to you. You watch a television broadcast AGE 18 and see all these schemes going on undercover. And you realize it's been like that your entire life. That's the only thing they can't take away from us. AGE 16 It's the only thing I have on my mind: my education. I wake up at 6 a.m. every day thinking: "This is my future." AGE 17 The idea we have of the marginalized youth, or any youth, is of an uninterested, careless person, TEACHER AND EdD who's irresponsible, violent, but that is not true. Our youth is going after what they want. This empty-headed youth doesn't exist. There's no one in the classroom who doesn't have plans. The crowds of teenagers in public schools today are working hard to get a job. They want to work, they want to be able to study, to go to university. And they often want to get married, have children. They want to be happy, it's what they want the most. Everybody here wants to be somebody in life. AGE 18 They don't want the jobs their parents had because people lead very hard lives here. Humble people. I'm going to be really rich. I'm going to have an awesome house, raise my children, go to Las Vegas. I'm going to have a pool with my name on the bottom. I have many dreams, which is a pleasure. But thinking about how to get there isn't so good. Because I know it'll be hard. You have to work really hard, study, to see if you can get somewhere. AGE 15 AGE 17 I'm afraid my wishes won't come true, that I won't fulfill my dreams. Our political leaders, those in power, never had their children studying in public schools. That's why I think public institutions are so neglected. There's a quantity issue: you have to make it universal, to expand attendance capacity. There's a quality issue: you've got to make it all better. PHYLOSOPHER, PROFESSOR AT USP AND EX-MINISTER And there's the issue of innovation. Public schools serve 82% of the Brazilian children and teenagers. I said 82%. PEDAGOGUE AND PsyD That isn't trivial. Out of 45 million, how many millions is that? If you stop and ask yourself: "What kind of school are they attending? What kind of education are children getting?" Then you get hopeless. TEACHER AND CULTURAL PROMOTER We had no teacher for three months here. Then we just had to skip the content. There was no class today. That's how it works: when we try to study, the school doesn't let us. I remember nothing from my junior year. I remember only what I did to pass my exams. I passed, got to the second year, but I learned nothing. So that's very disheartening, we don't feel like studying and I think many people drop school because of that. AGE 17 Because they'll find a better place outside school. AGE 17 NOT EVEN IN A WILDEST DREAM Evasion is like a ghost haunting our school. By the end of the year, HÉLIO RANGEL STATE SCHOOL 50% of the evening students are gone. Bro, school was the best part of my life. Studying and meeting new people, AGE 18 hanging out with friends, skipping school and so on. I think we neglect the youth when we assume just offering a school space is enough. Youth want schools with classes. Schools with good classes. Schools with good classes in which they can participate. And that, at the end of day, they come out better. A broad-based struggle for the democratization of Brazil, for the reduction of inequality, has to include a transformation of schools themselves. Every time schools give up on students' learning, they're raising the cost of society. They enter the labor market in a precarious and untimely manner, mirroring their families' situation. It's hard to study at 17, man. Because you have to work, your family is starving, you know? There's nothing at home, you need money. So you have to go to work. It was heavy for me. I had to be at work at 4 p.m. AGE 16 and sometimes I'd only leave at 1, 2 or 3 a.m. I was really demotivated, I had this impression that working would be faster, more practical. AGE 18 I felt that keep studying wasn't the best option for me. All day carrying gas cylinders on his shoulder, RONILDO'S MOM those big, heavy ones. I felt it wasn't right. He wasn't right. A young man can't be stuck in time like that, out of school. They're all at a loose end, young people who aren't in school are at a loose end. The sun sets, the sun rises, and they're wondering around. Because nothing happens in this town. We're giving up a project for society that can put our country in the 21st century in a dignified, consistent, transformative manner when we make schools uninteresting, causing students to drop school and go to waste. There can't be a perfect, emancipatory school in an oppressive society. Society wants the slum to stay a slum, man. My school for me was a place of discrimination. It was the place where I suffered discrimination because I was discovering myself as a lesbian, where I suffered from racism, and that's very hard on a teenager who's looking to find themselves in this world. AGE 31 It's hard to be underage, a woman black and poor. It's hard. AGE 17 I mean, education and school are of the utmost importance. I want education for all. But sorting out education is also solving these ethical conflicts that we have in our society TEACHER AND EdM and that strongly impact school on a daily basis. Around 38% of teenagers between ages 15 and 17 are not enrolled in high school or any other school, and they're not working. So the question is: where are they? We lose them because of drug dealing, pregnancies. We keep losing them, we can't keep them in school. And we never stop to ask, we never listen to these kids. "Why don't you want to stay in school?" SOCIAL WORKER We say they don't want to study, they'll be good for nothing. But who becomes the most feared criminals? Those kids nobody wanted. But why are they so amazing for the crime world? And that we can't see: because he could also have been a great leader for us. A career in drug trafficking brings you respect, honor, the possibility to protect your loved ones, it brings you authority, that is, a handful of advantages that, honestly, where else can they get? Especially if you pressure kids to show what they're all about at 15, 16, 14 years old. I've seen a lot violence, people dying. I got to my teenage years watching my friends join the world of drug dealing. And just these days a friend of mine died. He had barely started. So, you see, it's not worth it. AGE 16 It doesn't have to be the best school, to have everything, but we have to feel like coming to school. We have to be able to come to school and not find people selling drugs on the sidewalk, with fire guns, the police, not knowing if we'll be able to get in or out. In 2013, we lost five kids in 15 days. Murder. They were all students here. And that was so sickening, because these are kids you hug and kiss, ELZA CAMPOS LEMOS ANDREATTA MIDDLE SCHOOL who are there with you all the time. People say: "School is so boring." But even the most boring of schools saves thousands of lives in our country. We've engaged in a long struggle to fight child mortality and now we kill them all at 11, 12, 13 years old, because there are no public policies for the youth. We all pull the trigger for every boy murdered in this country. And our girls are falling behind, too. ADOLESCENT PREGNANCY I'm a young mother, a mother already. I got desperate, but then I accepted it because the people around me supported me. AGE 15 When I got pregnant, everybody said that I wouldn't be able to finish school and be someone in life. AGE 16 So I kept on studying. There was a lot of prejudice. But I paid no mind and stuck to it. I dropped school to work because I already have a son. So I started working to build a house, to have a place to live. AGE 23 Now I do. I'm a professional bricklayer. When I got pregnant with her, I decided to stop. I decided to be a mom. And I bring her with me because there's no one to watch over her and also because I don't trust anyone to do that. Some days, she behaves in class. Other days, not so much. This is a small town in the middle of the state of Piauí­. 50% of the population is illiterate. These people are our students' parents. We often have to fight the parents, because they say their children don't need to study that hard, that they'll die of studying. AUGUSTINHO BRANDÃO STATE SCHOOL My parents aren't successful, so they didn't encourage me, they didn't support my studying. They thought only rich kids go to university. I don't think they believed a poor kid could be knowledgeable, could be smart, you know? For them, getting a job after high school was the best I could do. Work on the plantations, or as a salesperson. For them, not even in a wildest dream could I be a psychologist, could I ever be a teacher. They never dreamed I could be a doctor. They had no dreams, so they didn't teach me how to dream. I learned how to dream by myself. I'm learning how to live pretty much on my own. Most teenagers nowadays go to school, they have their classrooms as a refuge from their parents. Most people here in Juazeiro have small businesses and such, and kids are expected to work there to keep the business running. I was one of these kids. That's why my parents don't like me very much. They wanted me to work there with them. But life isn't just work. What's the use of wasting your life on work and then suddenly losing everything? I started working when I was nine, caring for an old lady. When I was six, my father left. He said he was going to get examined or something and four years went by before we heard of him again. From six to nine, we went through great difficulty at home, we starved. So when I was nine, this old lady asked if any of us would like to go live with her. So I said: "I'll go." I spent a year and a half at her place without any kind of contact with my family. It was me, myself and I. I could choose to study, or not. Then I moved to another woman's place to care for her five-year-old daughter. Such an unequal Brazil doesn't make any sense. All dimensions have been shredded by this inequality. The cultural and environmental dimensions, the daily dimension, the housing dimension, the dimension of urban mobility, health, safety, education. We hold parent-teacher meetings. A hundred parents attended the last one. But there are 1200 students. Parents just don't come. I think they lack affection. When you talk to them, sometimes it makes you want to cry. Some students have so many problems, there are even cases of sexual abuse. We spend more time here with teachers and friends than with our parents, because they leave to work early... AGE 16 and come back at night, we don't see them. I live with my mom, but I don't get much advice from her. AGE 17 I don't see her leave, I only see her before she goes to bed. I'm very reticent to blame it all on the family. The family is responsible, that is a fact. But there are sides to this, because sometimes family is just one person, like a grandmother who raises her grandchild. So if we don't work with differences in family composition, it's unlikely that these families will show up at school. Because they already know that their kid is problematic, unruly, etc. Why don't you tell me something new? Your kid is amazing at drawing, your kid is amazing at writing. Did you know he's a good writer? No. We often speak ill of a kid, which is exactly what everyone else is doing. I used to take my personal problems to school. AGE 17 And when I did that, I realized I wasn't very productive. I'd think: "What will I study for?" "Education? I don't even know if I'll be alive tomorrow". I was very rebellious, I gave teachers a hard time. I'd sleep in class every day and, when I was awake, I was the devil. AGE 15 I didn't go to school to study, I had no interest in studying. I didn't care about teachers, I wasn't afraid of the principal. I went to school to play, to mess around and to eat. I just waited for break time to get my snack. I had a snack at 9:20 a.m., during break. But there was no lunch. So there was this library lady, an old lady, actually, her name was Laudinha. Sometimes she brought me lunch, you know? She knew I was going to stay at school and brought me lunch. Yeah, she helped me a lot. She encouraged me to read, too. I asked students if they had had breakfast at home. "No, I haven't had anything." So we started serving breakfast and there were no longer students passing out, feeling weak. I was checking their homework one day when a student came to me with his notebook, which was dirty with soil and some coffee spilled on it. It was the kind of situation that you look and get kind of grossed out to touch the notebook. But I had to do it. PROF. JOÃO LOYOLA MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOL And I remember I was very tough on this boy. Years ago, when the neighborhood streets weren't paved and there were only this narrow dirt roads, I made my way to his house, passing open sewers. It was all very precarious. When I got to his house, a lady carrying a baby welcomed me, there were other children around her, too. I said to her: "I'm Rurdiney." And she went: "Oh, so you're the Math teacher." I was surprised she knew who I was. So she invited me in for some coffee and showed me around. It was a very humble dwelling. It was basically a square with wooden walls, cardboard linings, a pile of mattresses on one corner, a small stove on the floor to cook meals. She told me: "My son really likes Math. He's passionate about it. He does his homework in his little corner over there. He lies on the floor with his notebook, some coffee and bread, and does his activities." She told me in detail how he studied, which took me back to the classroom and made me think of how I had treated him. And I got really disappointed in myself at the time. I think it's very important for teachers to understand their students' background so they can take that into account when they're teaching students something new. Ever since I can remember, every principal in this school fought for the school to be remodeled. The structure of our school, just like all other schools that have the same problem, is representative of the decay in education. The school hasn't been remodeled in over 30 years. I wish I had the money to remodel this school. I would've done it already. The least we can do for our students is to give them a dignified school to study in, because they deserve it. ANTONIO BATISTA BELO DE CARVALHO MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOL If the school architecture is repressive, if it gets people anguished or very stressed out, there's a tendency that our learning will be affected by that. ACTOR AND THEATER DIRECTOR The buildings look like coffins. There's no dialogue. You walk into a school and it feels like a prison. A prison, with bars everywhere. They keep high bars outside school and a low bar inside. MUSICIAN Every discipline is taught in isolation. Knowledge is totally fragmented. DIDÁCIO SILVA MUNICIPAL SCHOOL At the end of the day, after so many classes, students can't put the pieces together and see the big picture from above. BARS Education has become small for all the creativity that children and teenagers have. Youth is much bigger than the education given to them. Society is changing, AVERTANO ROCHA MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOL and schools are trying to keep up, but they can't. That's what I see. There isn't much discussion about the content. In general, I wouldn't say they're not interesting, because they might be. The problem is they're not important for what mankind needs today. Our youth is being left out of this party, as I call it, which is the production of contemporary knowledge. I think schools are trying AGE 16 to train alienated citizens who don't question our reality. I questioned my Sociology teacher. I wanted to know about the military dictatorship. You don't learn about it in school, because they want you to learn what they think you should know. They repress your opinion. Sometimes you're criticized for thinking differently. We should learn to question everything. Debating is very important because you can learn a lot from other people's opinions. Some teachers walk into the classroom and won't even say "good morning". They walk in, get into the topic and... Screw you, they don't care. I think a teacher should be excited about teaching. Why did he go to college, AGE 16 why did he choose to teach people if he won't even look at their faces? Our school has military ancestry. We learn to memorize, we don't learn how to learn. It's very much focused on passing exams and getting into university. They forget the human side, those things you need to learn, like socializing, learning naturally. AGE 18 Honestly, I've never used the Pythagorean theorem for anything in my daily life. There's so much unnecessary stuff of which just a basic notion would be enough. Many people say the school belongs to students, but it doesn't. It belongs to the government, to whoever is in power for that period. It's theirs. If you can't decide anything, it's not yours. If you can't do what you want, it's not yours. You're part of it, but it's not yours. It's a place where you go to spend your day locked in a classroom. You often don't know what the teacher is saying, you just have no idea. So you sit on your chair and decide whether or not you're going to pay attention. I'd like to use a microscope. I wanted to study Astronomy in school. I'd like to see the planets and the Moon up close, AGE 17 with a telescope. But, unfortunately... Structured learning is very unpleasant. But there are ways to make the content pleasant and link it to real life. But teachers aren't trained for that, neither are school coordinators and supervisors, because of the education they get. It's not their fault. In university, they weren't taught how to work with youngsters. He must be on top of the content and that's it, you know? That's a mindset from the 1930s. It's last century and he still haven't changed it. We're trained in a classroom in university just like the ones we teach in. How can we do it differently if you're not trained for that? Our students come with family issues, but we're not psychologists or social workers. PADRE LUIS FILGUEIRAS MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOL During the period you're in the classroom, it's war, you just want it to end. Time doesn't pass. Most teachers are on countdown mode. And they don't realize that there are tons of dreams, frustrations, tons of non-dreams, the impossibility to dream. It's all in the classroom. I think education in Brazil is so messy right now that we're on the verge of exploding. Our country doesn't value knowledge. When we talk about education and its importance, it's mostly lip service. And it's not schools' fault. I don't think we should say schools have to work this out, because it's not a school issue. It's a social issue. I believe our federal authorities should learn more about schools, they should understand better how a school should work and, above all, they should understand that you can't solve major problems like the ones we know to exist in our country's education, with a mere signature, at the stroke of a pen, as we usually say. The way to solve it is through dialogue. PADRE LUIS FILGUEIRAS MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOL The people who need to be listened to the most haven't even been mentioned in this situation, who are the high school students. It makes me sad to say that, because the school is ours, and to see that no one cares about something that belongs to you is kind of sad. They say the youth is the future of the nation, but what are they doing to make our future better? I like to quote Sartre: "What I do with what has been done to me." You have a problem, you're screwed, the world tramples you, leaves you out. Then what do you do? Just sit down and cry? Or you take up the fight and try to work things out? I decided to take up the fight. When faced with the impossibility, you stop. You cease your action. When faced with utopia, you have no reason to stop. You keep going. That's why man could make a machine heavier than air fly. Because it wasn't impossible, it was just utopian. I wouldn't like to meet a student again who gave up their dreams because one day, back in school, I gave up on them. It's a choice I make every day when I wake up. Nothing but problems at school, students don't want to go, there's no water, there's no transport, no meals for them. But I wake up full of heart and say: "I'm a teacher." CAMPOS SALES MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOL UTOPIA If compared to other professional groups in our country these days educators, in all our fragility, from a training standpoint, are still a very engaged group. It's what Salgado Maranhão calls an "addiction to dreaming", which is when the teacher realizes it is possible to make education happen in harsh conditions. Our town is among the 30 cities with the worst HDI in Brazil. Among schools that serve low-income students, we're the best school in Brazil. Every year, 70 to 80% of our seniors get into university, but we've managed to get 100%, a whole class. In a group of 10 seniors, surely seven or eight will get approved. That's for sure. They study whatever they want. We have former students going to med, law, engineering schools. We've got Olympiads for everything. There's the Math Olympiad, the Rocket Olympiad, which happens together with the Astronomy Olympiad. There's the Portuguese Olympiad, the Senator Games, there's the Robotics Olympiad, The IT Olympiad. Let me think. There's the Physics Olympiad, the Chemistry Olympiad. - Geography. - The Geography one, too. There's even an Oceanography Olympiad. AGE 17 Since the very first edition, our school has won medals. That's what made us famous. There was a year when our state got four gold medals. Three came from our school. I'd much rather stay at school all day than hang out by the waterfront, at the mall or something. AGE 16 But today we're going out. I think we're all proud of school somehow. We used to run from school when the bell rang. AGE 17 Now we spend the afternoon here. Students get here at six and stay until three. We do have a lot things going on in public schools that could be better shared, offered to teachers elsewhere. They don't have to reproduce anything, but it could work as stimulus, inspiration. But, unfortunately, most schools dance to a bureaucratic tune, and don't come out of their comfort zones either. I speak mostly for the state of São Paulo, which I'm familiar with. We work with 124 of these schools, but there are almost six thousand in total. For me, to make schools feel attractive to students first of all, we have to abandon the concept of conventional school. How you say it matters. Our talk has to charm students. That's where the magic is, we have to bring a feeling to the content. There's more to be gained if there's an exchange between teacher and student, so we move away from the medieval view of the teacher on his pedestal, unreachable, who's there to simply bring information to students, like teachers have nothing to learn from them. When, actually, there's so much to be learned from them. In our Geography class, we'll talk about the Amazon Basin, which is the biggest basin on the planet and contains the largest amount of drinking water in the world. The hotter part transfers heat to the cooler part. Or, physically speaking, the part with the higher temperature transfers heat to the one with the cooler temperature. So the Sun, which is hotter... We learn better, we hold it in memory. I think most students had already played in a natural pool and noticed our body weight changes in the water, but we couldn't explain why. It was nice to hear the explanation while doing the experiment in the water. When we got out of the city because of the noise, as they said it, it was peaceful and we could interact with nature. Our trip was very stimulating... AGE 18 the time spent with classmates, even if just for a while. We brought together people who go to the same school, on the same days, but don't speak to one another. And these people had the chance to get to know one another better and learn in a very special way. An unique experience. I talked to my friends and everybody loved it. I think that's the way. It was so exciting, really good. This relationship between men and their environment determines how culture works. Schools have to be like that. A school can't be insensitive to the light of its premises, to its contours. Most teachers I've had here in my high school were able to engage us in content, using their own life experience. And this engagement makes the content stick, it comes to stay. It's not a subject matter that I'll learn just to pass an exam, but I won't remember anything about it a year later. Ten years from now, I'll tell you how my teacher taught me that topic in detail. AGE 16 These are things we remember. It's about the teacher, not the content. Teachers make lessons interesting. The only reason I attend certain classes is because I like how they're taught. The content sticks to your mind. AGE 15 Students need to realize it's cool to be in the classroom and teachers need to lose the perception that stepping into the classroom isn't letting a bunch of animals loose, it's about having fun. I have fun in class. When we tell Math teachers to get them their students out of the classroom and take them to the Math lab, they go: "But my school doesn't have a Math lab." Your school building is a Math lab. AVERTANO ROCHA MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOL Show the kids the ceiling angles. You can find triangles on the construction ridge. They can learn the content through a song, a parody, a poem. PROF. JOÃO LOYOLA MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOL We find out that the student that nobody would vouch for, the one with bad grades, who doesn't care, doesn't participate, doesn't do the activities, who's always on detention, he's the best in class. I decided to work with the worst students in school, the ones with the worst grades, zero discipline, aggressive kids, bathroom trashers. I decided to take all 17 of them under my wing. I said: "Guys, come here, I want to talk to you." I took them to the library and said: "Look, I have a friend who has a sports training center in Guaratiba, and he wants a school team to take part in a tournament. And you are my team." They were like: "What do you mean?" "You are the school team. Don't you play ball?" "Of course, I'm a whiz." They all started bragging about their skills. I went: "Let's see then. There's no time to practice. It's this Saturday. We put on our jersey and play." I got a bus with a friend. I said: "Hey, lend me a bus. I'll pay you when I have the money." So I took the bus to school, put some snacks in it. On Saturday, I took them to Guaratiba. When we got there, they looked at the place and were impressed with the soccer field. So they played, and they lost. They went to the locker room looking defeated. I walked quietly into the locker room and heard them talking: "Man, we let the principal down. We came here saying we would win, the principal believed in us and we lost." So I came in and said: "Nobody lost, everybody won. You're still the school team. PROF. JOSÉ DE SOUZA MARQUES STATE SCHOOL From now on, we start practice and I want to tell you that you lost because you didn't study. What's a good result? Who wins the game? The team that practices the hardest. These guys you played against practice every day. They're here every day, practicing. So, from now on, you have to start practicing so we can win." On that evening, one of them said: "Man, nobody's ever believed in me like Andre." And since then, 60% of these boys have moved on to the next grade, 20% had to retake tests in some discipline and the balance 20% failed, because they had to fail. I don't want to save the world. I can't and it's not my ambition. But realizing their lives were different and somebody had believed in them triggered a change in them. These are the same guys who no longer trash the school, they actually take care of it. Last week, I was painting a classroom when one of them came and offered me some help. So they came to help. That proves student performance is directly connected to management, to the way you treat students. When I talk to a principal and he blames school problems on students, I can't say that's a good manager. For me, a manager's main quality is to like people. We have to look at people above anything else. They're going through a formation process that shapes their future lives. And that's very important. MUNICIPAL SCHOOL DIDÁCIO SILVA Our June Festival is coming! Everyone get ready for the event that will take place next Friday! All classes must be prepared! I've always liked to talk and listen, to understand how these kids see school. From these talks came the idea to reactivate the school radio, to organize the library the way it's set now. During "Cultural Saturday", students have access to other kinds of culture. They feel more entitled to school, more comfortable, they feel more connected to school. We have teachers who incorporate art to all subject areas. AGE 17 We used to improvise plays. We didn't know what it would be like, we had to make something up on the spot. It was great. Seminars are very dynamic, too. You read a book and act on it, you know? You can discuss it, it's great. AGE 16 We need more culture-related classes. They're good for finding talent in school. AGE 17 We want to know what History was like. There are so many movies that help us see what it was like in the old days, right? Culture and education are two buddies that can never part. It's important for motivation, but also to change our reality. It can get boring sometimes. You're always within those four walls. It would be great if a genie came and we could ask the four walls to change every day. AGE 18 That would be awesome. If the lesson is about organs, the walls show the inside of the human body. If it's about Caatinga, we can see the landscape on the walls. Then, you wouldn't just listen to the teacher talk, you'd actually see and hear it. We feel like astronauts building rockets and all. It's really cool to see that thing we put together fly really high. It's awesome. We see that thing we made actually works. It's very rewarding. AGE 18 Dear friend Francisco Ronildo da Silva, it's been a while, so we decided to invite you to return to school, which is fuller of surprises with each passing day. Here we can express ourselves, ask questions, state our opinions, listen to others' opinions, and draw conclusions on everything the schools proposes. Don't waste any more time. Come back right away and make your dreams come true. Love from your schoolmates who never forget you." I had quit, I was very disheartened. I thought I was just another pea in the pod. I also felt incapable. I didn't feel good at school, contents felt weird to me, I couldn't get ahead. It seemed to me people didn't care, they wouldn't help me. It seemed like it was every man for himself. The letter came to me as a big surprise. I wasn't expecting it. I was even more surprised with some of the signatures on it. That made me really happy, to see them show concern. They came over to talk to him as well. That really encouraged him. Sometimes they look at us as if we were their light at the end of the tunnel. There's no way I can say or do anything that will make them feel otherwise. PADRE LUIS FILGUEIRAS MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOL We have to respect their individual time and understand their individual dreams, too. Often, we almost feel like forcing that boy to finish high school and go to university. But sometimes, all they want is to be a farmer, a truck driver. Some boys here want to be cowboys, which is a very common job around here. If you want to be a cowboy, be a good cowboy. Or a good truck driver. Brazil also needs truck drivers and cowboys. Just be good at what you do, be a good citizen for this world. When you see the human side of a student, knowledge takes up a whole new meaning. PADRE LUIS FILGUEIRAS MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOL I don't want to be a glossary for complicated Biology terms. I want them to feel there's somebody for them. Understanding youth has to be a methodology, a working tool. I say the school principal was a father to me, you know? When I came from my town, I had nothing and no one. He's not just a principal, he's our friend, our mate. He jokes around, but he tells us off when it's necessary. But, above all, he's our friend. AGE 15 Students elsewhere study the same things as we do. But the way he teaches us is different. I think the difference is the relationship between students and teachers we have here. We play soccer with teachers, there's friendship involved. They're not just teachers, it's like we're friends. That makes us feel like we have to study harder in class. AGE 16 We came from private schools. The relationship between teachers and students is very different there. Here, we treat our teachers with all respect in the classroom. But outside, there's a beautiful friendship. AGE 17 Everybody here is an equal, you know? Regardless of religion, sexual orientation. The affection I don't have at home, I get here. So I feel comforted enough to study and get prepared to get into university and to plan my future, but also to live my personal life, to keep physically and mentally healthy. My teachers believed in me until the very last moment. They helped me to believe and to dream. That also helped me think over my condition, where I was and where I could get. My perspective on life and the future was none. It's good for teachers, who improve their skills. It's good for students, who can understand themselves and the world around them. It's good for society, because when students change, the environment they live in changes with them. It's a win-win situation. I think our profession becomes mediocre when we think small, negative thoughts. ORCHESTRA These guys don't accept what's laid out in front of them. They want more horizontal relationships, they want to start collectives, they want to learn in networks. So there's a revolution happening in education right now which is led by youth. TEACHER AND EdM Unfortunately, authoritarianism is a weakness, but people don't get that. The moment I shout, PROF. JOAQUIM BRAGA DE PAULA STATE SCHOOL I show I can't work things out in a better way. And if I can't see others, I can't identify what isn't working. We need to save our youth urgently, but it's either everyone together, or everybody loses. JOSÉ BEZERRA DE MENEZES MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOL Parents, students, teachers, the friends of the school, entities, associations, they're all our partners. Everybody's got to help the school. You're the conductor, you have to know how to lead your orchestra. We need an extremely sensitive leader, with a very attentive ear to achieve harmony. ANTONIO BATISTA BELO DE CARVALHO MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOL Because an orchestra without harmony... You know that girl who interrupted us, holding a broom? She was cleaning her classroom. She does that every day. I keep repeating this: "public" doesn't mean "free". You've been lied to your whole life. Public schools are very expensive. So, don't trash it. Take care of it. Students really enjoy spending time at the library. When Ricardo told me they would have to shut it down, I said: "Isn't there anything we can do?" So I decided to come help in my free period. We collected bottles and sold this material to buy paint for the walls. On my birthday, I came to work and the little ones had a surprise party for me. I cried my eyes out, it was so touching. AGE 16 I think it makes me feel prouder and prouder of myself. It's rewarding to see them recognize the work I do. I feel we've been programmed to think that changes for the better only happen with big actions, with very revolutionary events. What makes a difference are the small things. ELZA CAMPOS LEMOS ANDREATTA STATE HIGH SCHOOL The first thing that should happen in a school is it should have its own dreams. ECONOMIST A school should have its own goals, which are born from within, and common goals with society. The goals are the guiding light, the thing that directs your work every single day. It's where you're going. And you can get there naturally by doing your work right. I look at this school and see what it should be like in ten years. Goals need to be met because it can't stay as it is. When doing public management, what we really need is to create mechanisms to strengthen good experiences. When governance isn't good, everything falls to bits, it's all fragmented, and even the very positive things can't get across. ECONOMIST Our modus operandi in public education is still treating each individual to make it work as a hero. We celebrate a few great educators, people who are doing it right, but what happens later? What's left from that? We have to build a status quo in which good is normal, not the exception. What's beautiful and interesting about my school? What do I take from my time as principal? I'll end my time as principal leaving behind a group of people who believed in what I did, who believes in what we do and can keep doing, and who believes education is possible. Here, education is possible. It stops being possible when it gets to the first and second steps of our educational policy. But in school, it's possible. It happens here. Why don't we value these amazing experiences? Is it not working? Then look closely and act on it. But we don't do that in Brazil. The Brazilian society must want to be a knowledge society and make sure the country is going in this direction. If our government started seeing education as the solution, it would be easier to work. But, these days, our government sees education as a problem. I think the collective disappointment we're experiencing now, the fact that the youth now rejects our politicians, that's a sign of change. PEDAGOGUE AND PsyD I think the next generation is different. Somehow, it's different. DATES So what's left from all that? A revolution? I don't know. But I think schools won't stay the way they were. They just can't. If changing our school is what we can do, that's what we're doing. It's our legacy and we have to care for it, because future generations are to come. AGE 16 We have to start today. It's a way to lift our country out of poverty, out of misery. We're dreaming of a less unequal society. I hope it's not a very distant future. I don't look at it like it's going to take 20, 30 years. I see it as an achievement, a dream, a wish coming true. As a present time achievement. I don't want to leave Nova Olinda, I want to stay in Cariri. I'll be a proud teacher, because now I see new possibilities. AGE 21 And it all happened here in Nova Olinda. I want to be a part of the change. I don't want to be the one to applaud the change: "Well done." No, that's not it. If that's what we all want, we can make a change. I'm very optimistic and I think we're moving quickly in this direction. I think there'll come a new generation of pedagogues, educators and managers who are more sensitive. That's how it should be. We're doing it already. We're fighting to have the school we want. And most importantly, we're doing it together. The students are working with us. Education is my guiding star, AVERTANO ROCHA MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOL what gets me going. My life makes no sense without it. It's my weakness, what I live for. I feel like every one of them is like a son or a daughter, I'm very fond of them. I ran into a former student who's now a teacher here at school. And that brought me such joy, I'm so humbled to say that. We can't just think what we did was worthless, or that it simply got lost in the way. We know, sooner or later, we'll see the results. There are some plant species, like the dates, that you only reap the fruits after a hundred years. So you plant it, but you don't harvest it. You won't harvest it yourself, but it's important that you plant it. The future is now. Already. Already gone. RESPECT STUDENTS I've been told I wouldn't be anyone. Now I'll focus on my goals, go to college and make my dreams come true. AGE 17 I want to be a lawyer because I'm deaf. AGE 21 And I want to help my deaf friends, too. I was able to overcome a difficulty. So I want to help other people overcome their problems. I want to set up a rehab clinic focused on social issues. I want to help people. I want to be a pediatrician, which was my mom's dream she never fulfilled. I want to do that for her. I'm not a good student, but I want to go to business school. AGE 17 I want to challenge myself. I want to learn difficult things, too. A while ago, all I wanted was to apply to the Air Force Academy. But now I want to study Chemistry, I want to do Theater. Maybe Physics, but it's very hard and boring. Maybe not, but maybe yes. AGE 16 I want to get my B.A. in Arts, be a teacher. then I want to get my master's and doctoral degrees. It's a dream. I want to try a career in filmmaking, I'm into editing. Policewoman. AGE 17 I've always dreamed of it, I don't know if I can. AGE 16 I dream of wanting everything. Of knowing the world. One of my biggest dreams is to go to college in London. I like it there, I don't know why. It's a desire I have in my heart. AGE 16 I want to major in P.E. I hope to graduate from a pilot training course. AGE 16 I dream of being a fashion designer. I want to be a super pretty lawyer. AGE 14 I want to go to law school. I want to be a vet. Call me Dr. Samara. AGE 28 Who wants to be a dancer? I do! I want to be a dancer. AGE 17 If I don't become a teacher, I'll be president of Brazil. I'd vote for you. I think I'll travel every corner of Brazil. I want to see all of it. I want to meet everybody. When I've seen this entire world, I'll travel somewhere else. When I've seen this entire planet, then I'll go to Mars, then to Saturn. That's the way I want it. - Physiotherapist. - P.E. teacher. - Military officer. - Marine biologist. - Gastronomy. - Psychologist. - Art. - I want to study poetry. - Pedagogue. - Scientist. - Electronic engineering. - Sergeant. - Civil engineering. - Psychologist. - Business administrator. - Marine. - Visual artist. - Medicine.
