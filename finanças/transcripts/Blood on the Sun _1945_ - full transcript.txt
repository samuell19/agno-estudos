As the world observed the MEIN KAMPF's first successes... few people knew the existence of an Eastern Hitler... Baron Giichi Tanaka. The success of his plan to conquer the world, depended... of the secret. This film narrates how was he unmasked by... an American journalist in Tokyo. TANAKA PLANS AN ATTACK THE UNITED STATES. CHINA, FIRST VICTIM OF THE PLAN TANAKA OF CONQUEST OF THE WORLD UNVEILS A COPY ATTACK PLAN. Gentlemen, I did not know anything about Publication of this article. I was not in town. I will read what your newspaper publishes. If Japan wants to control China, we must first crush... the United States just like in the past, we had to do... the Russian-Japanese war .. Gentlemen, as you know for 25 years the Chronicle... supported the government, all governments. It's too late for explanations. This insult to Baron Tanaka and the Japanese people caused... great troubles. You know the penalties in case of non respect of censorship. If my editor broke the law, I will fire him. Nick! Nick Condon! Someone knows where Nick Condon is! He came out, something important .. He asked that we do not disturb him. It would be with the Emperor that I am do not worry, let him come immediately! Call him, Kitchan. As you wish, Mr. Sprade, but he will not love. Call him anyway. Hello... - Hello Oshima, What is it? - Nick. We need to discuss, if it does not bother you. No, very good. This is an official question of great importance. Well, come on, we can start. - Nick, please! - Okay, okay... Give me that towel, will you? Lies, lies, these are only lies. There is not a word of truth. A moment. You must disclose the source of information. The police must know the name of the traitor. Well, that seems fair to me, they have the right to know. The traitor is the American press. This article appeared in three New York newspapers. - I can not believe it. - Ah really? Ask your consul in New York. It's a shame when newspapers Americans publish these insanities... the good Americans get an idea false the friendship of the Japanese people I agree, I agree. You know, if there's one thing I hate, is someone to get a wrong idea... of Japanese friendship. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You can not do that to me anymore my tension will not resist. Suppose they took me down. When I arrived here two years ago, to take care of the newspaper... it was on one condition: to direct it. I know Nick, but you can not. You sell twice more of copies we have increased your... salary, you never won that much money! You do not shoot yourself not bad. You win double that you were given in Shanghai. You want to come back on our agreement? I appreciate what you did for the Chronicle but publish this. That's why newspapers exist, that's why people buy them. Not for Japanese propaganda. But it was only a rumor. Yes, and American entrepreneurs have the right to know these... rumors. I know, I know Nick, but a lot Japanese read us too. Well, I think it's more than a rumor for these two zigotos to come here. - I think I'm going to dig up this story. - Crease? You must forget it! You must write a disclaimer! I will write it when I get demonstrated that it is a lie. Nick, Are you sure this article appeared in New York newspapers? The Japanese censored them. - In New York they read it yesterday. - Hier? So how did you read it? Read it? I have written it. Nick, Nick, for heaven's sake. Hi Nick, I thought you were in jail. Someone will have to kill you to save face. Is not it a little early for that? No, no, it's just an impression. I learned that the police withdrew the Chronicle of all kiosks. I hope you all have yours. I can provide you with copies. No thanks, I want to stay in Tokyo, I just renewed my contract. - Have you seen Ollie, Ollie Miller? - No, no, me no. When Ollie Miller is not in this bar is that he is sick. - See you soon. - Goodbye. Hi Nick, this is Joe Casel, coming from Shanghai. - Nice to meet you. Sit down. - Yes. - Thank you. - You drink? - Scotch and soda. Me too Thanks. - What would you like? - Three Scotch with soda. Joe Casel... Joe Casel... You worked for the Daily Telegraph of New York. Then you went to Russia and Beijing, you worked a while for... the American Press Association since I lost track of you - You are famous - No, you have a good memory. - Are you looking for work? - No, I'm going home. This morning, I was at the embassy. Your article has upset them. It was fun. - That breaks the monotony. - Where did you shoot him? A little here, a little there... There is not an atom of truth and you know it. - I do not know anything, do you? - Enough. Our Chinese friends are trying to raise public opinion... against Japan. Why? To divert the attention of their internal mess and trust me... "disorder" is a weak term. - I just spent 4 years there. - I have lived here for 6 years. 4 years are enough for me and note that I have a great admiration for the... Chinese people... I'm sure some of your best friends are Chinese, right? Finally. - Hello guys, Hi Gugaloo, - Johnson... Did you read Nick's article from this morning? It's Dynamite, huh! How about drinking something? It's my tour, I pay. - Do you pay? - All you can drink! - So a double whiskey with soda. - A Bourbon with water. - And you, Gugaloo? - Me, a lemonade. You know what I drink. - Finally, Mr. Condon, China through the centuries... - Sorry, gentlemen, here... Ollie Miller. "Yes, gentlemen, I am leaving. - Again? Have you ever seen this? - Thank you. - Keep the change. Two tickets for the house, and on the first boat leaving tonight. The Nagata Maru. Where did you get the money? A new invention. A machine secret, you press a button and... there are 10 and 100 bills. In this case, what happens to 30, what do you owe me? It's a pleasure, it's a pleasure and here the 10 you did not want... lend me. Pay yourself another drink. We will continue next time, Miller has arrived. - See you soon. - Goodbye.

Where did you get the money? - I found it. Do not talk nonsense, where does he come? I could take offense to your tone of skeptical voice... but I prefer to be generous and Remember that you are my friend and former boss... and attribute it to a bitter desire of my good fortune. Ex boss? We're leaving tonight, Edith and me with Nagata Maru. Where did you get the money? Nick, accept my advice, come in to the fold. It gets hotter than the guts of Fuji-Yama. There will be blood on the streets tomorrow morning, it will flow like a river... before the summer ends. Are you involved in something fishy? Me, Ollie Miller? Do not forget, deck A, cabin 23.

Come on, tell me. Nick, suddenly, everything is wonderful, from poverty to wealth. How does Ollie explain it? As he explains everything. Sorry. By dodging. - He said nothing? - Vagently, very vaguely. Something about a book that he will write... a big literary contract, a big advance on rights... Well, good. Nick, no matter how he got it. Maybe he stole the treasure from the Emperor, all I know is that... we're going home. This country Kill him on fire and me too.

My concern is that he did not do it. Will you come tonight on the boat? Yes, of course, with two magnums of Champagne. - To make Ollie talk. - He already talked for less than that. Yes. Well, until then. Nick in case I could not tell you that night... You'll be the only one I miss here. I would like you to come back with us. Thank you, I'll see you on the boat. Now I go there.

You see that there is nothing, and now, get out of here! Yes, but you will come with us to file. Okay, okay, that's what I intended to do. If you do not mind, I will call my desk... You are not allowed to call. Listen to Oshima, I'm getting sick of it of all that.. Your leader, Yamada, is a good friend, I do not want to have to get caught. - Please come. - Good. Condon san. Tobacco, give me some tobacco. Hello, Condon san, I did not think find you a day here, except as a friend. Can I call? Hello? Here is the Tokyo Chronicle. You will have to explain, Yamada. Yes? Pass me Charly Sprade. Among other things, my government do not like being imprisoned... its citizens without the slightest burden. The Japanese government would not do that to an American, Condon san. Here is the indictment: Nicolas Condon, esteemed editor of... the Tokyo Chronicle, celebrated a feast private at his home, there was a lot... cheerful and a lot of noise, causing complaints from neighbors. These complaints remain unanswered, the police was forced to ask politely... let the noise stop. This request remains ignored, the police entered your house at 10:30. Where she found Nicolas Condon with two girls. Two, Condon-san? Mr. Condon, very affected by excessive sake requires the departure of the police, the police demand the departure of the two girls... Condon tries to chase the police, Condon was very drunk. Aimably, the police brought him at the station to protect him from himself. Hello? Hello? I was cut off, take me back Tokyo Chronicle, please. And as he is a very esteemed man and of great prestige... he is no longer mad at police protection... you can leave. Thank you. Hey Charly... Nick, please, go home and sleep a little. Yesterday you have us... all panicked. We even woke up the Ambassador. I do not know how to tell him things... Newspapers only talk about your exploits. Too bad, too bad, I'm happy that we have called the Ambassador. Remind him and tell him I have to see him immediately and then come... pick me up, huh! Yes, and take a camera, yes. Sergeant Oshima, do you know our good friend Condon san, Chronicle? We see each other often, it's an honor. It is not mutual. You murdered two Americans last night Oshima... One on Nagata Maru and another in my house. A serious accusation, Condon san, Do you have proof? Condon san and sake fought each other tonight. Sake won. I guess you were not at port nor to my house. We took our families admire the cherry blossoms towards... the middle of the night, a beautiful evening. Forget the nightmares and go to sleep Goodbye Condon san, and if I can afford a joke, I hope I do not see you again... here too fast. I think you are an experienced judoka maybe we could... measure us one day. Of course, but that day, it will be face to face .. You can put away your device. Ollie broke this window last night and they replaced it. Proof number one, there is even lipstick, proof number two... Yes, they did not neglect the details. They even cleaned blood stains. Yes, good work. What's going on Nick? We call, will I see who is it? Yes. Mr. Condon, please? - Come in. - Thank you. Mr. Condon. Thank you. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Let me lead you with his excellence... Prime Minister Tanaka. That's it I'll be busy during a few hours. Tell him... that I will go through his office this afternoon. Wait, not the offices, his excellence awaits you at his residence. It is an honor. Give me a few minutes, please. - You accompany us Miss Hilliard? - No thanks, prínce Tatsuki... I'm tired. Iris is not very happy these days. Unfortunately, it was necessary to involve him in this unfortunate... case. Colonel Tojo wanted it. Since when, Baron Tanaka, give in to the sordid demands... Colonel Tojo? I did not give in, prince Tatsuki, I approved them. In the future, I would be very happy that one does not oblige me anymore to... search the luggage of a woman horribly murdered. It will not happen again, my dear. I promise. - An interesting woman. - Yes. - Metisse? - Yes. - His mother was... - Chinoise. Baron, I shared my fears to the Emperor as to... the road on which you want to lead the nation. Your Highness, the decisions have already been submitted to the emperor. Your great influence could to curb the militarists. I'm just an old man, whose voice no longer has any authority. But you are one of the members the most esteemed of my cabinet, your highness. Valued? Esteemed as a liberal screen. I am the parchment of the poet, behind which we sharpen... the sword of the Samurai. Without an armed force, we will perish, That is my opinion. These views will lead Japan to disaster. We see the problem differently. That's for sure, to defend my ideas I will die in honor... You, Baron Tanaka, you will only die to clear your shame. Mr. Hayashi and Mr. Condon. Nice to see you again, Mr. Condon. Colonel Tojo, of the Imperial Army, you already know the major... Kayoka from the secret police imperial. Mr. Nicolas Condon. Sit down, please. Thank you for being here, it's much nicer than at the office. Here, journalists do not bother us. We consider your article yesterday, Mr. Condon was a bit boring. I can not please the world. Of course, we understand that you could not foresee the inappropriateness... of your statements. In short, Mr. Condon, some subversive liberal factions of our... country want to create an incident to weaken this government. These are the authors of the malicious rumors that you have regrettably published. As I said, Mr. Condon, the article in itself is not important. These rumors about a document planning the conquest of the world are... ridiculous, but if this rumor was taken seriously by the wrong people... that would cause a fire that for Japan would be... expensive to extinguish. I see, what you would like is the chronicle launches campaign to put out the fire... - Is not it? - No Mr. Condon. In the last 24 hours we have discovered a plot to leave the country... this false document. A man named Oliver Miller, one of your former employees, is involved. We could have retrieved the document by force, if we had wanted it... but we would prefer that you persuade us to return the document. It seems like you did not know, Excellency, as well as your secret police, major, that Mr. and Mrs. Miller... were murdered last night. Yes we read in the press your that little night's escapade Mr. Condon. In your inconsistent state you have evoked this unpleasant fantasy. Since we were even more concerned that you... Mr. Miller's fate, we made a small survey of the captain of... Nagata Maru, a man of all trust. Mr. and Mrs. Miller, are at edge of Nagata Maru... both in perfect health, both surprised by the investigation.
