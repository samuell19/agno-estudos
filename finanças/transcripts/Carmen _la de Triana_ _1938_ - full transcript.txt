But if I just wanted to deliver one little thing, Sergeant? Enough, I said no. Out! 'Out! Out!' As if I were being thrown out like a dog. I warn Your Grace that I'm not just anyone. Hasn't Your Grace heard talk of Salvador Lorca, picador of bulls? Even if you were the king himself, outside of visiting hours, you can't see prisoners. Who's talking about seeing prisoners? - Then what do you want? Listen calmly. I go in, I give him this, and without saying anything, I fly away! Fly away! You're going to 'fly away' right now. Pest! - Ah! Sergeant. Where's the commandant? - In his office, Brigadier. In the last year, we’ve neglected too much of this mountain range. From Medina-Sidonia to the Valley of Pinar. This area is now the smuggler's foremost field of operations. Captain Moraleda. You must urgently reinforce all of these posts. At your service, Commandant. I'm Brigadier José Navarro of Vitoria Garrison. There you have your new brigadier. Basque? - No, Captain. From Elizondo, Navarre. Is there a police service in Vitoria? No, Commandant, but we all know the rules. Theories which in practice don’t help anyone. The Andalusian smuggler, our greatest enemy, is bold and daring and we need to vanquish him. Understood, Commandant. Additionally, we must make a real show of austerity. All right, Commandant. And deal with the villagers as little as possible. Your service papers. Damn it. They'll stab you in the back. Salvaorillo! I haven’t met you yet, king of bullfighting. Bad woman! - Hey! Thanks for the compliment, ‘Picador.' Do you have anything for Antonio? Are you going to see him? - Take him this tobacco. Wait, kid! Don't you have a little… I was going to say remorse, but I won't say it. - Oh, boy. Fine, I’ll say it! The tiniest bit of remorse! The poor thing is in jail because of you. Because of me? - You're saying you didn't know that gypsy, so you can give that to Antonio? - Oh, good God. What are you saying? What gypsy? I never saw him in my life. - Liar! You let the curse into our house. The best bullfighting of the year. That’s what you're happy about? - Me? Yes. How brave. When you read your name on the posters you must make sangría. A joke, huh? A joke? - Go now, fat man. Don’t go to the barracks, Carmen. Leave poor Antonio in peace. Besides, they won’t let you in. - Who, me? Not you, nor the king himself in the flesh! The sergeant just told me. I have a talent for entering where I want. You’ll see what the guard is made of when I get by. Bah, they’ll shoot you! Hey you, pay attention. Hey, handsome. May I go in? Permission to see a poor prisoner? Hey, boy. Don’t make a face as if I were that ugly. Look at me already. Man, I thought you were cardboard for a second. Look, wonderful. Look. I have a doubloon. Like the sun, huh? For you, precious, if you let me enter. Take it. Drink to the health of Carmen, the gypsy. Hey! What are you doing over there? Oh, nothing, General. I heard Antonio Vargas the bullfighter was here, and I brought him some tobacco. He’s not allowed to see anyone. Out! Hey, don’t treat me like that. - Go, I told you already. Don't touch me! I'm leaving already. You. Give back the doubloon I gave you! - To the street! Sergeant. It’s disgraceful for a Spanish soldier to treat a woman like that. She's a gypsy. - She's a woman. What does she want? To see one of the prisoners. - Antonio Vargas, the bullfighter. Apologize and accompany her to see the prisoner. Shall we? God bless you. Let's go. Antonio! Carmen! - Kid! How did you get in? - There are good people in the world. Give your thanks to him. Soon we'll make some real money. - What are you going to do? Pay you what I owe you, that’s all. Because of me you're here and because of me you'll get free. Thank you, Carmen, but money’s already on the way. What shall we do? I told you my plan. Take this tobacco. Sorry there isn’t more. - I see you’ve remembered me. Don’t flatter yourself too much, peacock. Where will I be able to see you on the outside? - Oh... Nowhere and everywhere. When you get out I'll have forgotten you. I'd rather be dead I’d rather be dead than spend all my life imprisoned in the Port... Port of… Port of Santamaría. Sentry, sentry, it's your fault that I stayed awake all night... Where will I go in that little boat that cruises the serene sea Some say Almería, and others say Cartagena. Some say Almería, and others say Cartagena. and others say Cartagena. Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay! Little sailboat that comes from Cádiz, that comes from Cádiz, from that bay. that comes from Cádiz, from that bay. and doesn’t reach port, and doesn’t reach port, Port of... Port of Santamaría. Silence! Hey, get out of here! Be quiet, Admiral. You thought the prison belonged to you. Goodbye, Antonio. - Not even a hand, woman? Well why not? Here are two of them. Let's go! Let him finish! Jerk! Bye Antonio. - Give me the carnation in your hair. You’re too late! This carnation already belongs to another. Who? - Someone who defended me like a knight. And who's that? - Didn't you hear me? Ask Solomon. He who knows everything. - Very well, Carmen. Come back whenever you want, precious! Let's go. To the street. Here. Are you dancing, Carmen? - No. To see me dance, go tonight to the Mulero in Triana. Oh, tell me yes. Oh, tell me no, I love him like no one has ever loved him. My coalman, black as coal. It’s your fault that my heart is black. It’s your fault that my heart is black. The moon is hidden, the moonstruck moon, The coalwoman has opened her window, the coalwoman. And the coalman goes to the mountain singing in starlight. The day arrives. The day arrives. Casting clear light on the olive groves. Casting clear light on the olive groves. Oh, tell me yes. Oh, tell me no, I love him like no one has ever loved him. My coalman, black as coal. It’s your fault that my heart is black. It’s your fault that my heart is black. He wears a sash of silk, my coalman, and a Marseilles jacket, embroidered with velvet. And on the hat, there's a ribbon that says, ‘For you I die.’ The day arrives. The day arrives. Casting clear light on the olive groves. Casting clear light on the olive groves. Oh, tell me yes. Oh, tell me no, I love him like no one has ever loved him. My coalman, black as coal. It’s your fault that my heart is black. It’s your fault that my heart is black. Oh, tell me yes. Oh, tell me no, I love him like no one has ever loved him. My coalman, black as coal. It’s your fault that my heart is black. It’s your fault that my heart is black. Oh, tell me yes. Oh, tell me no, I love him like no one has ever loved him. My coalman, black as coal. It’s your fault that my heart is black. It’s your fault that my heart is black. Come here. Hey. You sang very well, Carmen. - Thank you. What do you want? Wine? - What do you want? I don't drink. But I like when men do. In that case... sherry. Hey. What you did for me this morning... Would you have done that for any woman? - Yes. Even a slattern? - I don't know what a slattern is, but yes. And I’d figured… Of course. You're a gentleman. Can I ask something? - Go ahead. Would you leave already? Who is the prisoner in the barracks? - With a willow staff in in his hand, by a path that leads to the river, went Antonio Vargas Heredia, the gypsy. Between the orange trees, the moonstruck moon cast its light of orange blossoms on his forehead. and when the light of the day arrived reflecting the green of the olive grove, the green of the olive grove, Antonio Vargas Heredia, flower of the gypsy race, let fall the staff from his hand and the carnation from his mouth, From Puente Genil to Lucena, from Loja to Benamejí, From Puente Genil to Lucena, from Loja to Benamejí, the young girls of Sierra Morena die in sorrow crying for you. Antonio Vargas Heredia, they die in sorrow crying for you. Antonio Vargas Heredia, the gypsy, the most arrogant, and the most handsome, and in all the surroundings of Sierra Morena, there was no one better, more handsome, nor honest. But because of a gypsy girl he sunk his knife in a man’s chest, infernal jealousy clouded his eyes. and prisoner in a cell of rage, he wept, of rage, he wept. Antonio Vargas Heredia, flower of the gypsy race, let fall the staff from his hand and the carnation from his mouth, From Puente Genil to Lucena, from Loja to Benamejí, From Puente Genil to Lucena, from Loja to Benamejí, the young girls of Sierra Morena die in sorrow crying for you. Antonio Vargas Heredia, they die in sorrow crying for you. Now you know who's prisoner in the dragoon’s barracks. Now. A man who risked his life for you. You'd never do that. - I wouldn't? You want to put that to the test? What do you know about love in Seville? No, don’t laugh. You’re made of wood. You’re as cold as marble. Would you be capable of loving me like that? I’ve loved you ever since I saw you this morning in the barracks. You see a few hours have passed? Well I feel as if I’ve always loved you. You don't believe that, Brigadier. I swear to you, Carmen. - Carmen! You're on, Carmen. Carmen! Carmen! Why don’t you give up this life, Carmen? - Why? Because I’m a gypsy and I have to die like one. And a man has to love me on my terms. Hey. Now go. I don’t want you here while I work. What are you doing? - Quiet! Where is the Mulero? What happened here? - Nothing, Captain. Two girls from here– - Nothing really, Sir. One dancer pulled out another’s hair. And that made blood gush from her face? Look, Mulero, I know you and your dancers. This is the second fight in a week. If there’s a third, I’ll close the café. Brigadier, arrest those at fault and take them to prison. Do you realize what you’ve done? I’m going to claw her eyes out. - You’re crazy. Leave me alone. Well, let’s go. Where? - To the prison. As a prisoner? - As a prisoner. There's no other way. Oh! I pulled her hair because of you, and you want me locked up? What a stroke of luck. How ungrateful! Please understand. I took the uniform. I have no choice but to carry out my duty. I rot in a dungeon so you can carry out your duty, is that so? Would you prefer I be punished? How long will I be in jail? - I don’t know, for a little. And how long is a little? Twenty days, a month. I don't really know. Move along. Hey... Can't we put off prison until tomorrow? Such a truly Sevillian night makes one sad. There’s no helping it, Carmen. Hey, not even for a little while? So I can say farewell to my Triana and to my river. All right, let’s go. You don’t think I'll escape? I don’t think so, woman. They say, Soldier, that Seville is in love with Triana. Do you think places can love each other like people? Triana! Oh, my Triana! Triana! Oh, my Triana! In the crystal of your river I often looked at myself. And in your streets of perfumed jasmine, the moon kissed my forehead. I have no greater treasure to sing of than the neighborhood that cradled me. Oh, the bells! of my Santa Ana! Sunny Triana, the murmurs of my soul are more flowery when I return. Triana, I must see you. I’ve lost you, my neighborhood, like the Moors lost Granada. And so great is my grief, that I no longer know how to cry. As God is my witness, as great as is my blame, greater was my punishment. As great as is my blame, greater was my punishment. Triana! Oh, my Triana! Let’s go, Carmen. It’s already late. Hey. They say there are rats and bugs in the prison. Is it true? - No, woman. I'd like to change my clothes. May I? Are we far from your house? No, it's around the corner. Let's go. Turn around. Carmen. What do you want? Oh, nothing. I'm ready. Whenever you want. Whenever you want. Shall we? Hey, José. Don't tie my hands. I can’t wait any longer, Carmen. For the crime of abandoning service, we condemn Brigadier José Navarro to be stripped of his rank. Two years solitary confinement in the Castle of Gibralfaro. May God protect His Majesty – Seville, July 25, 1835. Stop the wagon. Hey, come here. Let’s go. Damn it. Who are you? Did you hear me? Don’t be like that, Brigadier. You're among good people. Here you have it. Carmen. Did you do this? - Who else would it be? I told you that when gypsies love, they overcome everything. You'll see I'm good for it. I pay with solid gold and false coins. Freedom is good, huh? The best thing God ever made. Is this him? - That's him. Go on, drink. How'd it go? - Wonderfully! Hey! He doesn’t seem so bad. Say something. He's very reserved, you know? Better. - That’s right. Better. Well our business, my friend, is like any other. We go from Gibaltrar to Spain. Sometimes it goes smoothly. But other times, it's a challenge. What happens... Can you ride a horse well? - Oh! What were you in the dragoons? Colonel? Brigadier. - It's all the same. Well, give him the clothes and we'll talk. Let's go. You brought me here for this? This doesn’t suit you? Well… go then. I haven’t tied you up. So... you want me to be a smuggler. I don't want anything. But I told you, the man who loves me has to love on my terms. You only think about yourself. Men want everything while giving nothing. I’ve sacrificed everything for you. My career. My military honour. That seems like a lot to you? I’m not worth more to you than that? Go on and leave then. Antonio Vargas Heredia... flower of the gypsy race… - Carmen. let fall the staff from his hand. Do with me what you will. I appreciate it, Brigadier. Bravo. Congratulations, Lieutenant! - Brigadier, nothing more. Salvador! But how? Free? - I paid the fine of fifty ounces. Oh! How cheap freedom is! Bravo. Bravo to pretty women! - Oh, the women! Do you still remember that gypsy girl? - Yes, I remember. Where is she? I don’t know. She got in a fight in the Mulero and no one's seen her since. I like that girl. - Let's get going! Onwards! At your service, Commandant. Brigadier García, present. The captain has ordered Moraleda be substituted for Navarro. We will reorganize the squadron to make a heavy raid on the smugglers. It’s scandalous. Daring to abduct a military prisoner. I don’t believe he was abducted. - What? The assault was orchestrated by Navarro himself. - Incredible! That would bring shame to the squadron. The gypsy girl has to be at the center of all this. Well. Leave immediately for the mountains with our best men. Locate the smuggler’s den and bring back Navarro, dead or alive. Triqui! Hey, did you bring something from José? - I brought… Wait... - Let's see! This! A little something! How precious. How pretty you are! Let's see. How pretty you are! Hey, tell him that I will go see him tonight. Don’t tell him, Triqui. You never let me go. Women! If you don't come dance tonight they'll suspect you have contraband. Everything prepared? - Yes, Señor Juan. But José says we have to take another route. Another route? - Yes, he drew this. He says we need to go through the Valley of Pinar, through here, around the mountain, and then up. Why? - Because the dragoons could come from below. All right. He'd know best, after all. Be more careful than ever. - All right. Hey, anything for José? Well... - What? One thing you can’t bring him. All right, woman. Goodbye. - Goodbye, Triqui. You say he’s in Zahara? - Yes, with that brigadier. With the brigadier in Zahara. How rich, how rich. But best be quiet and keep it to yourself. He says he doesn’t know anything about her. But I think that that woman is in Seville. Damn it. Look, Salvador, I’ll give you twenty ounces if you find Carmen for me. Twenty ounces? Where has that woman got to? No vehicle can remain without registering. - Mount your horses! Can we follow the usual route, Captain? I’ve marked a new one here. - Ah, to avoid an ambush. Remember that Navarro is with them. And if I stumble on him? - Don't concern yourself with that. All right. - Look. This is the route to follow. To arrive at the Valley of Pinar, turn to the right, go around the mountain and return to the road. The patrols always go through here. We must go through here to avoid passing over the summit. Sure, but it’s the longest road. But more secure. - That's no worry of yours. What you have to do is… - I don’t want to encounter the dragoons. You don't like to quarrel with your men. - That would only make me a jerk. Come now, come now. - Hello, Triqui. You’ll have plenty time to kill yourself. Señor Juan doesn't agree with the route change. Well yes, Señor. He agrees. Bring out the merchandise. Why didn’t Carmen come with you? - She asked me to tell you… Hey! Are we telling secrets? - Secrets... She wanted to come, but Señor Juan wouldn't let her. You're still keeping that up? What would you have me do, stuck here? Stay at your post while the others make the shipment. You know what? I’m already fed up of dancing for those people. Business is business. And now one must be more careful than ever. Why? Are you afraid of something? - Well, I’m afraid of… And what do the cards say? - Nothing good. I’m drawing nothing but swords. Look. A three, a five. And here’s poor José in the middle of them. - What nonsense. There he is. José. Carmen. Don’t go tonight, José. - Why? I don’t know. - Because the cards said not to? Oh, gypsy girl. But when are you going? - I'll be back tomorrow. Tomorrow. And tonight? Carmen... These three are coming with me to Zahara. You go ahead. And remember what I told you. Let's go. You're so calm. - Yes. Promise me you’ll do what I told you. - I promise. I'm not afraid anymore. You need to burn that deck. Goodbye, Carmen. See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. Be careful, José. Who goes there? Carmen. Why are you trembling? I'm afraid. The man you love… will die because of you. A curse hangs over you. Like blood. You lie! - Sure... but the man you love... No, no! You lie, you lie! Witch! Come, they're waiting! - Let go, I need to see José. The dragoons are in the café. - Let go! You have to entertain them. - Let go! José! Let go, Juan. José! What do you want to sing? - “The Coalmen!” All right, “The Coalmen.” The moon is hidden, the moonstruck moon, The coalwoman has opened her window, the coalwoman. And the coalman goes to the mountain singing in starlight. The day arrives. The day arrives. Casting clear light on the olive groves. Casting clear light on the olive groves. Oh, tell me yes. Oh, tell me no, I love him like no one has ever loved him, my coalman, as black as coal... Keep going. Keep going. Let's go. It’s your fault that my heart is black. It’s your fault that my heart is black. What happened, Juan? - A patrol went after them. Oh, I knew it. - Shut up. Jesus! What was it? - There was a tip-off. We stumbled on the dragoons. - What else? They took the Jerezano, and José was shot in the shoulder. Is it serious? - Looked like it. And the merchandise? - It’s all wrapped up. They took José to the cave. Don’t go to the village until you hear my order. All right. Take her. I could almost stab you right there. - Well go on! Why didn’t you tell me Carmen was in Zahara? Don’t deny you knew. - Because the less said, the better. Tell me with whom you're... hey! You’re an embarrassment. - Here comes the bull! Tomorrow we go to Zahara. - Tomorrow there’s a bullfight in Ronda. Then we’ll go after the bullfight. Squad! Steady! Forward! March! Did he come yet? - He’s on his way. Carmen. You were dreaming. If only it had all been a dream. Pass me my uniform… Go to sleep. Hey, Triqui, take me to town. - You're leaving, Carmen? Never to return. I'm not good luck. When he’s healed, tell him it’s for the best. And he can still be the gentleman he always was. Where are you going to go? - Me? To see the world. To sing and dance to entertain people. Salvador… The very same. How are you? And Antonio? - Good, thank you. We’ll see if you think you’re the only woman in the world. For Antonio, no? Ah, a pity. Besides, you already have someone else. Does he have someone else? - Sure, he has anyone he wants. Well that’s that. Hey. Tell that boy that whenever I want, he'll come to me begging to kiss the ruffles of my dress. You heard me? I'll make sure to tell him because he'll laugh. That's why I told you. So he would laugh. Come off it. It's not worth it. Thank you. - And why didn't Brigadier García come by? He's in Seville - Partying, huh? No, Señor. He went to look for reinforcements. - More soldiers? Well, that’s all right. To finish in fifteen days with the contraband. - That's right. Well done, Señor. Well done. Well, and did many come? - It seemed like a squadron to me. Good, man, good. You all come around here. - See you tomorrow. Goodbye, man. I am here, Salvador. Have you seen her? - Who, Carmen? Not a trace. How can that be? I hear her voice. What, her voice? - Can't you hear it? You're a scoundrel and will pay for this. You deceived me. - Man… Hey, do you like this? Do you want it? You don't want it. I know you're not interested. You like it, huh? Well take it! Carmen! Ah, it’s you, king of the bullfighters. The very same! - Well, I'm here so you can reject me. Who, me? - Yes, you. You, the peacock who will reject me. You, who have as many women as a sultan. Are you serious, Carmen? Come on, kiss the ruffles of my dress. - As you wish. Damn it. Crazy, you’re crazy! You see, Salvaorillo? All that's left is for him to cry. And it will be drool that falls. Damn it. Anything else? - Yes. Leave right now because my husband is coming. You're married? - Yes, lawfully done. A priest, a sacristan and eighteen witnesses. Is that true, Carmen? Is it day right now? Well, as true as that. I am on honeymoon, dripping syrup from all over my body. Are your eyes welling up, king of the gypsies? Come on, be happy. It was all a lie. Swear to me. - By this! Oh, kid, how bad you are! That hurts, kid! If you knew, Carmelilla, how I suffered searching for you. I haven’t loved any woman in the world as much as you. I know, Antonio. But between you and me, there can’t be anything more than bars. Iron bars, so that you are free. Flee from me, Antonio. I'm cursed. - That's how I love you. With a cursed love. To suffer with you, but always by your side. There's so much suffering that I can’t bear my heart to love you. For me you’re like the sun that warms me, but doesn’t embrace me. I don’t want you to turn off your light. - By your side forever, understand? But the iron bars are between us. A woman treated me well, and that woman left when I needed her most. While she was at my side, I could have forgotten everything. But now I must put an end to that. Well, you know what you’re doing. - Does Carmen know that? No. Go. Go then, Juan. - Wait, José. I’m going to give you your money. - No... You take it. I don’t need it. - Me? Yes, to buy what you want. - I’ll keep it in case you change your mind. Spend it as you will. - Thank you, José. Goodybe, Triqui. - Goodbye. José. What? - The law will want to make you talk. Sleep well. A shame. - What’s a shame? He brought us bad luck. Besides, do you think he’ll turn himself in? I don’t want to talk, because… - No, no, talk. You know reinforcements are coming. He's a coward. No, José didn’t know that. - But he knew it, it’s the same. What are you saying... - That I'm up to the neck in traitors! Stop that nonsense. Hey, Miguel. I thought that before the reinforcements arrive we could demolish the bridge. And if a complete squadron arrives… It's a good idea to blast the bridge, but when the soldiers are passing. And who will go through with it? - Me. The path through the gorge is extremely dangerous. I’ve been through it often, Commandant. - In any case, be careful. And trust in Garcia, who knows those people better than us. Yes, Commandant. Carmen. Triqui. You're here? - Yes. Where's José? - He went to Seville to turn himself in. When did he go? - This morning. On horseback? - No, on foot. He didn’t want to take his mare. Do you think we can make it on time? - If we leave now. Wait for me outside the village. Something to eat? - A bowl of soup. Do you want some bread and wine? Sure. What’s happening here? - Nothing really. The bullfighters are arriving from the Seville Fair. Ah. The soup will get cold. What’s this? - This is proof... that Frasquito knows how to treat good bullfighters. Well, thank you very much. Oh! With all this commotion I'd forgotten you, sir. Which one is Antonio Vargas? The dark one in front of my boss. The others are from his gang. Are you going to the fair? - No. You're going to stay here without seeing the bullfight? That's right. - What a shame! You're missing the best of the year. Come now, Señores. To the Seville Fair. - Bravo! To the most valiant bullfighter in Spain! One moment. Will you allow a poor traveller to toast? - I allow it, Señor. Antonio Vargas Heredia, I am going to toast to the woman you love. You know her? Very well. - Carmen? Carmen. What did I do, king of gypsies, for you to treat me so badly? A drop of blood for every drop of wine that spills. The sentence wasn’t carried out, so I don’t have to cry for you. Don’t disrespect me, Pharoah. I give you blood from my own lips. Because I don't need any of your light. Now throw down your knife. Yours too. The dragoons are coming right now to look for you. Juan and his men are waiting for them. Now go, if you want. - You’re lying. Calm down. No need to hurry, Vargas. Why did you come, Carmen? I can't watch a bullfight? Sit further back, so Antonio doesn't see you. - Leave me alone. Did you see how great he is! Go higher up. He's coming. - I said to leave me alone. The best, the best! The best! Did you see? Carmen's here. - Yes, yes. Hey, give me the cape. Thank you, Carmen. When the bullfight is over, take this cape. I want you to make a gown for Our Lady of Mount Carmel with it. Thank you in the name of the Virgin, Antonio. Goodbye, Carmen. - Good luck, Antonio. A toast for this bull and the woman I love. The prettiest woman in Spain. It's for you, Carmen. José! What are you doing? Don’t worry. I’m going to turn myself in. Come off it, José. Travel the mountains with us. - Not anymore. Listen, a squadron of dragoons is going to arrive from the path in Arcos. They're crazy! - Why? They've all been paid. And you also. In Arcos, you said? - No, at Pico Bridge. And what are you going to do? - Miguel is going to blow it up as the troops pass. You're sure it’s Pico Bridge? - Yes, didn’t you hear what I said? Do you have a horse? - Yes, yours. Like you... at the foot of my cross, see me weep. Give me faith to suffer my sorrow and my pain and my solitude. Antonio Vargas Heredia, flower of the gypsy race. You risked your heart in the game of love. How bad I was! And in the light, like the sun, your light has been extinguished. And in this darkness, this blackness of pain, my life will be. If with blood in my veins I could make you live, the carnation that withered, my kisses would open it. Oh, what pain! Like you, at the foot of my cross, see me weep. Give me faith to suffer my sorrow and my pain and my solitude. Hurry up, Miguel. There goes the gunpowder. Come on! And warn us when they pass the bridge. Not even their arses will be left. What’s happening, García? - No news, Captain. Hey! Light the fuse! Halt! Who goes there? - The dragoon Navarro. Captain, the squadron has fallen into a trap. They want to blow up the rocks at the edge of the gorge. We can’t lose any time. Squadron! Turn around! Take the cart. Navarro. Navarro… Let me in, for charity's sake. I only want to put down these flowers. - Get out of here. I wanted to see him one last time. - No one may enter. Leave her be. Come, Carmen. In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, we reinstate all the military rights acquired during his service, to Brigadier José Navarro. Brigadier José Navarro. Yes, sir! José...
