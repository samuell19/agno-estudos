All you need to be a doctor is confidence. Confidence doesn't cure cancer. You think you could tell a dying man what medicine he needs without it? I think the drugs would help more. Of course, it doesn't matter in the long run. A patient who has cancer is probably gonna die anyway. If you're tending to him, maybe. Doesn't change the facts. All men are mortal. I can't believe no one's thought of that before. Hey, hey. There's a first time for everything. Sure, and maybe someday you'll just shut up and do your work without complaining for once. Some things are beyond the reach of man. With what we have here, we're firing in the dark. We might as well give up. What's the point of saving anybody's life if they're just gonna end up dead? So, if there was a bullet in your leg right now, what would you want me to do? Why, you planning on putting one there? If you don't stop being so stubborn, who knows? Well? Sure, I'd want you to call an ambulance. But it wouldn't matter. Even if I were to survive, even if I were to recover, someday I will die. And someday so will you. Another brilliant observation. If you're gonna be throwing this many nuggets of wisdom my way, you should really be charging by the hour. I consider it charity work. It's just one life, one death. Sure, a couple people may cry over it but it wouldn't matter to the world. Not to history, not to eternity. Unless you were someone like Jonas Salk. But even then. Even then? Salk is dead, but his work lives. And not because of some text book but because he made the impossible possible. But even if he never did that, it wouldn't matter. At the end of the day, there's just really one disease. I've been pouring over this brick for three months and I can assure you that there is, in fact, more than one disease. There's only one that matters. Can I help you? This is... This is Wagner. Yeah, I know what he is. Be nice. Of course, it's always nice for the dropout to drop in. Stop it. You know, that's a bad guy you go with. Do you have the pills? These are breath mints. Oh, sorry. Thanks. Do you have the other thing? I had my friend run some tests on those samples. Is this... Is this true? Trust me. My friend's very scientific. Gretchen? Come on, get up. Five more minutes. I wanna get some food. Where? I don't know. We'll figure it out on the way. Fine. Okay, actually, I have to use the bathroom. You ready? Yeah. Elevator dinging I was thinking pizza. You down for pizza? Ah, Faust? Tacos. Oh, I could sure do with some tacos. I saw your book. You were in my bag? You're trying to change the subject. I can't believe you did that. I want you to look me in the eye and tell me there's no cause for concern. You wanna hear me say that, hmm? Fine, there's no cause for concern. Are you serious? What's the use of saving people's lives if they're just gonna end up dead? You wanna bring back the dead? That's step one. After that I wanna end it all. This pestilence, this mortal prison forever. It'd be the greatest advancement in human civilization since the invention of the wheel. This is insane! It's not insane to want to make the world a better place. So you're gonna do that with some asshole who thinks he's the devil? He's not some asshole. He's the real deal. So, you're gonna sell your soul to the devil? That's your fucking strategy? I'm gonna have to find him first. It's poison, it's all poison. You can't judge a book by its cover. The arsenic, the cyanide? Purely experimental. Get over here. He's dying. We all have to die someday. He's not dead yet. So, Chinese okay? We're done. Gretchen, Gretchen? I don't know who you are anymore. And I won't watch you destroy yourself like this. You gotta be kidding me. I've endured watching you burn yourself from the inside with Wagner's shit for years. That medicine is prescription. Prescription cocaine? That was one time. One time that I know of. But see, that's not the problem. The problem is that you're weak. I don't need this from you, I don't, I don't. Stop. Weak. Now listen to me, kid. I'm not your fucking mommy. If anything, I'm the guy that's fucking your mommy. And the moment I'm done fucking her with my big demon cock, she's gonna be the first person that you're going to have to resurrect. Nice to meet you too? So you wanna talk to the dead, huh, kid? I don't just wanna talk to 'em. I wanna bring them back. Why, why do you want to raise the dead? You got a wife? Girlfriend, kid that died and you want to see them again? If you want my advice, you're better off with a shovel and nightly access to a graveyard. And pay off a guard or two, that usually works. Huh, do graveyards still have guards? I don't think so. Oh boy, I could tell you some stories. Where was I? Breaking into a graveyard. With a shovel? Right, you're better off doing that than worrying about this necromancy bullshit. You can get into a graveyard, you can get your hands around a body. You can loot 'em. You can fuck 'em. That's absolutely disgusting. Don't kinks-shame folks, it's impolite. I didn't mean any offense. Offense is taken. Not given. But nevermind that. Let's quit the foreplay and start fucking. We've got a transaction to make. Your soul for the ability to perform necromancy. Perform, you should get yourself a crowd, do it on stage. Although that'd make for a hell of a entertainment, that's not really the point. At least not for me. You see, I wanna make the world a better place. I think you came to the wrong guy. You're the devil. So why'd you think I could help you on your crusade? You wrote the book on it. To cause chaos! Horror, mischief. I've got little patience for men with noble motives. Why do you care? As long as you get your soul, right? To the point, I like that. I'll get some bite out of you yet. You know, I don't entirely hate it that you got good intentions, kid. Thank you? If I ever need somebody to pave up the driveway by my house, you'll be the first person I'll call. You a doctor? Yes. You ever seen a man die? Yes. You ever killed anybody? No, not on purpose. Well, that's where we're gonna start. What? You heard me, bitch. I'm sorry, I thought... Excuse me but I want to raise the dead. Well, somebody's got to kill them first. I'm sorry, I don't think I can. Listen here, now you're not gonna be a cunt now are you? Are you? I wasn't planning on it. You definitely don't wanna do that now. I won't. I just sealed the deal in blood with magic. That's fairly obvious. Dark magic. Wow, and here I was thinking this was the kind of blood sacrifice one would describe as using the good kind of magic. Now Faust, you're going to do everything that I say you're going to do. Exactly when and how I say it. I want you to follow my instructions no matter how difficult to follow they might seem. If you don't, I'll torture the everliving shit out of you. And ensure you die an extremely slow and painful death. That seems reasonable. Well then, let's start. Lesson numero uno. You have to know how it is to take a life before you can bring anybody back. And if I do this, I get the powers that I seek? When you get down to it, Faust, I don't care what your intentions are. What you want... It doesn't matter. What matters is that I get my reward at the end of our deal. My soul? That's the idea. Three kills, one week, that's your training. You don't deliver, you never get to get your dick hard on raising the dead. And there will be hell to pay. You can't do this, it's been less than a week. You're not my mother. You went through a month's supply in less than three days. No, he took them from me. Replaced them all with breath mints. I told you he was a bad guy. Do you have it? Do you have the money? I'll get it to you. No money, no deal. But I thought we were friends. Fine, but just this once. Help! Please, please don't kill me. You're a worm. You can't do this. You're a doctor. Well, I guess this gonna be the first time a doctor ever killed anybody then. Please, is this what Gretchen would want? She doesn't know what she wants. And you do? I know her better than she knows herself. She asks me to do things for her. Yeah, I know how you poison her. Things she'd never ask you. It's in here. Thank you for doing this for me. I know it's a little gross. No problem, I assure you. It'll be my pleasure. What's that supposed to mean? She gave me blood and urine samples. And I passed them along to an acquaintance of mine. Another one of your victims? Another one of my friends. Yeah, you have so many. She ran a variety of tests. Off the books. Don't worry, no written logs, no electronic records, no nothing. You know what I found? I found out, just like your precious Gretchen did, as a consequence of her little hobby, it's entirely possible and to be quite frank, fairly likely, that her heart could literally explode at any time. Explode? Pew, explode. But you already knew that. After all, you know her better than she knows herself. You poison people. And what's that in your hand? Cyanide You know, maybe you're not so bad-- You just bought yourself some time. A couple of hours at most. There's no way you're gonna get away with this. What you gonna do, hmm? Call the cops? So what? You're gonna rob me too? Nah, I'm not a thief. I have no passion for those baser human instincts. Sometimes, sometimes you gotta break a few eggs to make an omelet. Enjoy your last day, asshole. Hey, Gretchen. Hi. Your breath is minty fresh. Is everything okay? Tell my mother I love her. Excuse me, we're kinda in the middle of something. Okay, why can't you tell her yourself? I think that's why. Oh my God, Gretchen. Gretchen, look at your phone! Look at your phone! Okay, supposed to be here any minute... No, hey, hey, hey. No sneak peeks, this is for cast and crew only. I'm just here to see my girlfriend. Oh, Gretchen? Yeah, you know her? Oh, she's on the floor over there. Why is she on the floor? She dead. This must be some type of sick joke or something. No, for real. She's dead. I think she moved. She dead. I think I saw her do it. She definitely moved. Oh, oh, she alive now? I could've swear I did. Okay, she might be alive though. Oh, she alive? She might be alive. I think y'all just like touching her. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, what? Okay listen, I'm gonna check the pulse. I'm gonna check the pulse. Oh okay, touch her then, touch her then, touch her then. Wait, wait, wait, wait. You being a pussy, touch her! All right. Oh no, she dead than a motherfucker. I killed her. I killed her. I killed my girl. I killed my girl. Gretchen, oh my Gretchen. Hey buddy, I'm sure that's not true. I killed her, I killed her. Gretchen. Yeah but, uh, no, no. Like we saw her kill herself. There's no one else to blame. I killed her! All right, you got it, bro. Hey, maybe you should move aside. Wait until we get some medical attention for her. Get a ambulance, a stretcher, or a doctor, okay? Okay, let me move back. A doctor? A doctor, I am a doctor, I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor, I'm a doctor. It's okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Gretchen. I'm so sorry. Hey, you're that guy. Your girlfriend Gretchen, she killed herself. That was crazy. Damn dude. Anyways, since I ran into you, I think you should know that the play is tonight. We had to push the premiere back after everything that happened. I thought we should go ahead with what we had planned but with your dead girlfriend on the floor, everyone else was against it. What's your opinion on the matter? I don't care. I really don't give a fuck about your stupid fucking play. Really? If you care so little about our play, then why were you at the theater the other night? I was planning on bringing my girlfriend some red roses. I knew she liked to visit her friend when we... when we... Oh, but she was dead. White orchids, sympathy lilies would have been much more appropriate for the occasion. I didn't know she was dead at the time I was at the boutique. I suppose that's a reasonable position to have. But all that bullshit aside, you oughta know it's a pretty good play. As I said, I do not care. It's people like you that makes me wanna makes me wanna kill myself. Do you think that they'll get to us? We can run. We can run, run, run. But we can never escape our destiny. I don't think we need to worry about escaping destiny. For now, I'll settle for just escaping the Nazis. You know, Emil, I don't think this is the best way of dealing with the imminent threat of the Gestapo. I think we should stay here. Just call it a night. And then what? What if things get worse? We'll burn that bridge when we get there. That Nazis already burned that bridge down. That's why we took the long way around. I'm not a coward, Claude. You're not de Gaulle either. If I die, I shall die as someone who was true to himself. Yes, but you'll be dead. Yes. So, what do you suggest we do? Go home, go back to what we were doing. Ah, this is madness. No! This is Vichy France. We have to have faith in ourself, Claude. Go back to doing what we were doing. Show those rat bastard what we think of them. We shall continue to write highly provocative satirical poetry about the Vichy government and the Nazi regime in general. Ah, they'll kill us. Not if our observations are incisive and astute. They'll guillotine us. We're not dealing with the Jacobins here, Claude. We're dealing with the Nazis. Nevertheless. Do you really think that'll work? Absolutely. The only thing that will stop the Third Reich is love. I hope you all enjoyed the show. I have a announcement and a special surprise here. As you may know, our dearest friend, Gretchen killed herself last week right here. That was the announcement, onto the surprise. Her boyfriend is with us tonight. Come out here you handsome devil. Thank you, thank you, ladies and gentlemen, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to speak about something. Actually, I'm here to speak about someone. I'm here to speak about a murderer. Faust, come out here, you dog. This is the man who killed her. You're a rotten liar. Wait a minute, dude. I did hear you saying you killed her. No, no, I didn't kill her. Not directly, but I'm indirectly responsible. That's what I meant. He killed her, dude. No. You killed her, dude. No! You killed her, dude. You killed her, dude. You killed her, dude. You killed her, dude. You killed her, dude. You killed her, dude. You killed her, dude. You killed her, dude. You killed her, dude, you killed her, dude. You killed her, dude, you killed her, dude. You killed her, dude. You killed her, dude. Oh my God, Oh my God, what am I gonna do? You should be asking me. What do you want? We had a deal. Well, I should probably inform you that we don't anymore. Where the fuck are my bodies? This was a mistake. This was all a mistake. Where the fuck are my bodies? I am not a violent man! It's a regular old murder. Not like anybody's getting hurt. No, no, you can't make me do this. We'll see about that. I asked for three fucking corpses. You give me three fucking corpses. When I ask for three fucking corpses! Now what the fuck did I ask for, huh? Three corpses. I'm sorry, I can't kill anybody. The fuck are you talking about? I'm not a murderer. I'm a doctor. I don't get it. You're three feet away from home base and I'm trying to coach you on how to get there. And you won't let me. It's not like I'm starting you from scratch. What's that supposed to mean? You killed... What's her name? Gretchen. I mean, that's one out of the way right there. I didn't kill her. Yes, you did. And as a matter of fact, you got a two-for-one deal on that, you devious bastard. Good thinking. What? What are you talking about? You don't know? You don't know! You don't know. She was pregnant? Yeah. So she died. Yup. So this wasn't planned? No! This was an accidental abortion? That's my favorite kind. Oh my God. Don't get all drama queen on me now, Faust. I mean, it's all just facts. She killed herself for a reason and that reason was you. Take it back. I'm trying to give you a compliment. Take it back. No, it's the truth. Although, I should point out that, you know, given the fact that she had to deal with you for years, I'm actually surprised she held back on killing herself as long as she did. Now, I'm not the guy that you should be getting mad at. I am not a killer. You killed two people. I just want one more. It's not an unreasonable request. I am not a killer. Jesus, now look, I understand that you think that this whole thing might be-- A terrible miscarriage of justice. But you, Faust, you decided to pursue the art of necromancy. You decided to send me that fateful fucking email. And you decided to kill Gretchen. No, no, I'm done with this. And I'm done with you. Bitch, you called me! You promised me a soul. You made a contract with your blood and you promised you weren't gonna be a fucking cunt. And look now, here you are. Do you have any idea how many people ask me for the same exact thing you did? Not even just favors they want from me. Do you know how many doctors have reached out to me over the years to learn necromancy? For the express purpose of making the world a better place. How many? A fuck-ton. And most of 'em were a breeze. A pleasure to work with. Oh, but you. But you. Most folks wouldn't dare. But when cunts like you do, I crucify them and set their still-dying bodies on fire! Do you take their souls? They are not worthy. I take my pride in my work, boy. I take a great fucking deal of pride in it. But I've never taken a soul unless I've earned one. And I've earned my fair share time and time again. If you had so many students, how come none of 'em ever sought to make the human race immortal or work to the extinction of death? Once they figure out how to make themselves more than human, people don't wanna share that luxury with others. Their luxury only remains a luxury if it's rare. What about their secret knowledge? I don't give a flying fuck what they do with it. When immortality has lost its new sheen and... Poof. They take it with them. That is the option they choose. Always. Always. Always. That won't be me. You won't get there. You die in this room, you die here now. I refuse. Not bad, not bad at all. I am a charmer. Now, let's chalk this up as lesson number two. You're a pain in the ass but I'm pretty hungry and I think we had a good talk. If we're gonna do this... You gotta know I'm doing this to save this rotten world. Not because you scare me. Aw, that hurts. I don't scare you? My will is more powerful than you could possibly imagine. Do your worst. Happy to oblige. I hope you fucking burn in hell. Hell's got no circumference, kid. What's the time, kid? Five to midnight. Perfect. It's the best time for this sort of thing, I tell ya. The witching hour's the bitching hour. That's what I always say. He's really dead. Let me check that for you. Yeah, he looks pretty fucking dead to me. Abracadabra. Abracadabra. Abracadabra. Abracadabra! What the fuck, dude? You're the devil. No, I'm the devil. So what? You're gonna kill me too? No, he is. But I just brought him back to life. You have to know what it's like for that to mean nothing. I'm sorry Wagner. No, you're not. No, I'm not. Abracadabra. Abracadabra. Abracadabra! Ebrah k'dabri. I'm sorry. I know everything that happened. Faust. If I knew what he was doing, I would've stopped him. I'm sorry. I should be the one apologizing. Why, it's not like you're the one who killed me. Yeah, I totally didn't kill you. Wagner, that son of a bitch. Total son of a bitch, bitch of a son, a son of a bitch of a son of a bitch. That motherfucker. Total fucker of mothers. I wanna apologize for the way I was before. I'm sorry. It's... This can't go on, not after what happened. Gretchen. I can't go on. Living? Oh, no. I'm not gonna kill myself again, I promise. Once is enough for a lifetime. But then? Thank you. Very much for resurrecting me but this is goodbye. Gretchen! At least for a while. Tough luck, kid. Yeah, I know. It's about to get tougher. No. No, no fucking way. We had a deal my friend. You do everything that I say you do. When I say you're going to. And you're gonna do it exactly how I say it. This is not a charity. I don't do my job, I don't get my soul. And when I don't get my soul-- I get hungry. And when I get hungry-- Let's just say, I'm not me when I'm hungry. I can't do this. I might be the devil, but I'm not a fucking communist! I want my soul. I could do everything else. I have done everything else. But, I can't do this. You told me earlier that you wanted to make the world a better place. I do! Did you mean it? Absolutely! I don't think you did. I don't think you mean half the things you said. I don't think-- Cut the shit! I'm gonna get the pitchfork again if that's what it takes. I'm not afraid of your fucking pitchfork. Then you're a fool. And I'm not afraid of you either! Then you're a bigger fucking idiot than I thought. I didn't think it was possible. But here we are. Yeah, here we are. What are you afraid of? Dust. I said we couldn't do this, at least for a while but I... Are you all right? Please sit down. I made a pact with somebody. I sold my soul to the devil. Don't you dare say what I think you're going to. He's cruel, unfair. But if he gives me what I need, at the end of this, I could end all human suffering. That ever was, that ever will be. And what do you have to do for that? He likes to torture his students. Sounds like a lot of teachers I've had. What torture, Faust? I have to kill you. Jesus. But I could bring you back. Right away. It's wrong, this is all wrong. And you know it. It's necessary. You'll get arrested. You'll be thrown in jail. You will be punished. The arc of the moral universe is long but it bends towards justice. Somebody has got to do the bending. We all want the same thing in the end. I don't want to fucking die. We both know that's not true. You absolute cunt. It's not personal. Why do you think he's having you kill the one person you are closer to than anyone else? Please, stop. You don't have to do this. This is not who you are. I sent the text. What? I beat the shit out of Wagner, I took his phone, I thought it would help you. I thought it would be good for you. You thought wrong. I thought it'd make you stronger. If you ever loved me. I do! More than anything in the world. Not everything. Most things maybe. But not everything. I'm sorry. But this? This is for the greater good. This is for the future. This is for mankind. Liar. I can help people now. You can help anybody you goddamn want to. But let me ask you a question, kid. Was it worth it? The few who knew what might be learned foolish enough to put their whole heart on show and reveal their feelings to the crowd below mankind has always crucified or burned. I now know that there's no nobler cause than that which possesses my heart. And what is that noble cause which so dearly possesses your heart? Life. Human life. What it once was, it'll never be again. And I'll make sure of that, I promise. And God help anybody that gets in my way. I knew a cunt like you once. I remember he said to me the exact same thing, the exact same way. Would you like to know what he ended up doing? Are you sure? I don't think you can handle it. It's knowledge. Not poison. He called it reason. Only to pollute its use by being brutaler than any brute. That's not me. Maybe you shouldn't have shot me that email. Maybe you should've just broken into some graveyards and fucked some corpses. It would've been much easier. I'm a necromancer, not a necrophiliac. Hold on. You're not gonna take my soul? Well, my dear boy, the devil's in the details.
