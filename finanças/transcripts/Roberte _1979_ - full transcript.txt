Phew! Nobody! Another minute outside and I’d have been done for. A bunch of idiots who take their restlessness as the enrichment of life. No pleasure from any richness gained by pausing to look at themselves live. For what is richer than life that gives itself as a spectacle? There, holding its breath, suddenly suspended in its fall, it unveils itself. Eyes for the fires of concupiscence, ears to open to immoral discourse, a tongue to prostitute to calumnies, hands to devote to theft, feet to run to the crime. Andiamo! You villains! Who was that person? Antoine’s tutor. Antoine is Roberte’s young nephew. You have to admit amazing things happen in this house. Blind despite his eyes. Deaf despite his ears. Forget that incident, cousin. I find it inadmissible that Roberte voted in the House against the subvention in favour of non-state schools. Inadmissible, you say, but for me, as far as Roberte is concerned, I think: contradictory. I’d like to show you a very curious painting that marvellously illustrates that contradictory logic. “Lucretia and Tarquin”. You’ll have to attribute words to Lucretia to really feel, like me, that perfectly contradictory something that the painted movements and the restlessness of her body suggest. Who did this painting? A little 19th century master. One Frédéric Tonnerre. “Mirabile dictu! Duo fuerunt, et adulterium unus admisit.” Look at the attitude of the hands. One lying, and the other confessing to a crime that seeps through its fingers. The irruption of pleasure in Lucretia’s body coincides exactly with that of the moral repugnancy in her soul. Cousin, I’m giving you this painting for your charity auction. You are guilty, Octave! You take pleasure in visions where you think you recognize a woman whom you’ve led to err. That painting is a fake. A pornographic fake! March 1958. Here I am resuming… the dear old… habit… contracted… in childhood… of writing… a journal… of free enquiry. Those fifteen years old images are as strong as ever. It seems that, far from weakening them, my married life with Octave is reviving them. But how could I reconstruct the scene of the “grave offence”? In vain I re-read what I wrote in autumn ‘44 in Rome, once I’d got over my emotion. I’d hoped to see those burning images consumed in oblivion. Instead, they’ve smouldered beneath their embers. Thou whose death finally allows everyone to say: I am the truth, receive here the fruit of Thy teachings. May I put into practice thy sublime words, “Let the dead bury the dead”, according to the exegesis that I attempt to draw from it: let remorse bury remorse. Roberte, don’t move. Father, can I confess? Have you forgotten what you have to do? That’s why I’m here, Father. Why dress like that in a place like this? Don’t worry, and don’t forget your role. My role? To act with or without witnesses. We need those documents tonight. What documents? Relax, the old lady is not bothering us. Why should she? Courage, Roberte. Act, and make the most of the candle she’s just lit. There, she’s heading for the exit. You who have insulted the Word, who are you? Heavens! Behold the corruption from Paris to New York! Sad times. Sad times. END OF ROMAN IMPRESSIONS First fragment Ah! Justin, if one could put a stop to the corruption infecting all our young people. It’s a desire that does credit to your new functions, Madame, but… Inspectress of Censorship, surely that’s a heavy task for a woman. Hold on, Justin. I haven’t said yes yet. The dragon’s watching, my friend. I’m off! Antoine is an orphan, too young still to be left to his own devices. Since I don’t have children, he’ll be my brother and my son. I shall preserve in him the greatest purity of intention. I shall teach him not to confuse his adventurous impulses with a deceptive need for justice. Why did you call me? I’ve done nothing wrong. Antoine, I don’t much care for your classmates from that private school. Because they come from a wealthy milieu, they think they know all and possess all. They’re only the golden boys of a bourgeoisie condemned, I trust, to disappear. You don’t even know them. All you like is to lecture me as if you were still at the House. Precisely! I intend to take you in hand and enroll you in a state school. What are you saying? I want you to learn to create your own truth, Antoine. You don’t like mussels? Yes, yes, I do. - It’s scented. - Thank you. Do you like working in your bank? I beg your pardon? Well, you’re at the start of your career, aren’t you? Yes, I currently handle the deeds. I didn’t care for the State exam. But I have a degree in Political Science. What do you think? It’s not bad. I’ll need a secretary for my campaign. Would you like to try? You are very kind, Madame, but your activities… I fear I won’t be able to help you as much as you would wish. Come with me. You’ll understand immediately. Can I clear the table? Obviously. Not at all, I have nothing to do with that financier. Those around him are at each other’s throats. I’m well-placed to know how they make the shares go up and down at the Exchange or how they secretly control the investment companies that deal in property and give them public funds. How can you be seen wearing such a monstrosity? What time do you have to be back at the bank? If I can still give you some clarification, it can wait. You couldn’t be better placed to inform me. Isn’t the experience provided me each day by my collection of Tonnerre’s unexhibitable paintings a deceptive derivative to that which I aspire? The sharing of an asset all the more immutable that it remains incomprehensible? One only lends a precious and rare object with the utmost reluctance. But how to lend one’s wife to other men? Would I gain anything by seeing her treated as a value? Will I be punished for offering her as the hint of possessions to come? And yet, such sharing of a dear but living being is not without analogy to the hallowed gaze of an artist. Life itself, the physical life of my wife can belie the sincerity of my generous act. The prestige of a jouissance freely given, the vulgar call it the favour of a woman who’s bored. But no one sees my emotion. It has no reference for this mercantile race. Hello? Yes, he’s here. Hold on. Is it you, cousin? Is it definitive? I’ve been excluded from the Faculty. That’s enough. You're wasting my time. You have to call my bank to say I’ll be late. You still haven’t told me what you think. She looks too much like your wife. Blind despite his eyes. Deaf despite his ears. Disgusting old pervert! Worthy of the bitch! What a cow! Justin, whom are you talking about? Madame, of course! Madame! One is supposed to be jealous like that mercantile race. The snaps you’re going to see were taken by the press office of the Palais Bourbon, probably during the campaign on the politicians in the street. Thus, under everyone’s eyes. However, one detail, anodyne if it didn’t concern Roberte, gives those anecdotic images the whole value of an exhibit. Look carefully. That you could think there was a trick or a staging of those photographs wouldn’t take anything away from their documentary value. On the contrary. You don’t notice anything? I only see my aunt passing people I don’t know and pulling on her gloves again. Pay full attention to the way she slips on her gloves. I’ll take it back. Does that shot seem to you identical to the one preceding, or the one following? I quite like this one, Uncle. Why is that? Perhaps because Aunt Roberte is looking… Anything else? Does her hand seem to be in a natural position to slip on a glove? The thumb is raised too high… but, that way, it stretches the flesh of the palm, makes it perfectly round. I’d like a copy of that photo. Out of the question! However, it is the forfeit of an operation to which I agree to initiate you if you know how to keep silent. I swear to you. But prior to that, I would have to ask you a few embarrassing questions. Expect to be less free, even if you refuse to answer. I don’t care about my freedom. I don’t know what to do with it. There is someone at this moment between you, my nephew, and me, your uncle. It’s not my fault if things have gone that far. It’s not your Aunt Roberte I’m talking about, nor the disputes I have with her about your education, but someone who perhaps affects her in some way. But between you and me, who else is there, Uncle? The one who prevents us getting along at this precise moment. And yet, without him, we couldn’t succeed. A fourth person? No, a third person. The one who intervenes between you and me, between me and Aunt Roberte, between you and your aunt. And this third person is a pure spirit. You must be joking. I have never been more serious. I have named Roberte to him. - What are you driving at? - At fulfilling your desire… You… me with my aunt? Don’t go so fast! Turn off the light. Nothing is more impalpable… despite appearances. It all depends on him. What’s happening to you, Uncle? Listen carefully: I named Roberte to the Pure Spirit. “You and your laws of Hospitality! My poor Octave, you think that my conjugal honesty and my lack of religious beliefs make me a monster of inconsequence. You think I am chaste. You think that by committing adultery or prostituting myself I would end up suffering in my soul until finally I believe it immortal and that a salutary shame would be born from the satisfying of my senses. That I would finally be divided, open to grace for having opened myself to what you call sin. But you are misjudging us. A woman is totally inseparable from her body. Nothing is more foreign to her than the distinction between the physical and the spiritual, and the insurmountable misunderstanding begins with the idea that she is a mere animal. But the thing is, her body is truly her soul.” Here he comes! Professor, I’d like you to meet the man to whom you owe Frédéric Tonnerre’s paintings. My friend Vittorio de Santa Sede. Pleased to meet you. Very pleased indeed. If only you knew how your discovery has brightened my final days. I’m delighted. I’m almost certain… that Frédéric Tonnerre was a pupil of Courbet. Undoubtedly. Salomon told me we are on the same side. You’re a professor at the Catholic Faculty, I believe? Of Canon Law. Well, I myself was an adviser to the Vatican, but the war, alas. Salomon, do me the favour. Bring Monsieur de Santa Sede to the house. I absolutely must have other paintings by Tonnerre. Would a deposit do? Count on me. Delighted to have met you. Thank you very much, Salomon. See you soon. Goodbye. The deal was one thousand. I myself shall give the five others to the maniac. When it’s all done, you will put that in her bag. That Octave has the inconceivable arrogance of thinking himself the author of my misbehaviours is all for the best. But as for thinking he’s at the origin of my temperament, the poor old dear hasn’t the faintest of what I’m capable of without any help from him. Could it be that a woman, since she is honest and respectable, is actually seeking that violent feeling of shame? I remember I felt ashamed. Did I enjoy it any the less? Are you feeling all right? You’re a bit pale. All things considered, what should I rebuke those people for? If they have enjoyed a pathetic pleasure. For me, it’s now that pleasure begins. Turn off the light. Are you feeling all right? You’re a bit pale. How calming is the fountain fall beneath the plane trees. How delightful is this city as it slides gently downhill. What’s going on? - She went to enrol him at the lycée. - It’s in the bag then. Antoine will no longer languish in a private school whose regime he couldn’t bear. By enrolling him in a state school, I took the situation in hand again. But isn’t it a challenge to have him here permanently when Octave has the sabbath prevail? Roberte. Roberte! Roberte? - Yes? - It’s me, Octave. Roberte, I would like to introduce an excellent friend. I’d be happy for you to accept him as Antoine’s tutor. You have to admit Antoine needs private tuition. Monsieur de Santa Sede’s references are irreproachable. But I leave it to you to decide, and to inform him of the circumstances that made us call on his services. Do with me whatever you please. From me you can only expect indifference… and forgiveness for the rest. We only met a moment ago, it’s pure madness to entrust Antoine to you, but I count on your common sense for total silence. I don’t want to know how you escaped the Germans in Rome, and then the Allies. I’m not curious either of the fate you reserved for Von A. and his victims. Cigarette? It’s up to you to choose between a revenge that would cost you dear and a behaviour strictly limited to your functions as a tutor. I would never have had the audacity to accept your husband’s offer if I had known I’d find you here. My good fortune never ceases to surprise me. Who would have thought the sensations experienced ten years ago in wartime circumstances would be renewed within so charming and welcoming a house. Out! This is mine. Antoine, this is Monsieur de Santa Sede who’ll be helping you prepare your Baccalaureate. What a torture, what an injustice is that Baccalaureate. Madame, when will you vote for the school reform? Not before Antoine has passed it. But that is pure cruelty, isn’t it, Master Antoine? You may go. You’ll have plenty of time to get to know each other. Why tell him I’ll be his tutor? I was ready to leave and disappear forever. I can see what your game is. Now that you’re here, you’re going to stay. Come with me. You’ll stay at the other end of the apartment. Here’s your room. But be warned. You won’t move from here without my knowing. You’ll only come to me when I call you. At your service, Signora. There wouldn’t be any if you hadn’t given him bad habits. It’s more than time, at sixteen, that he stops considering himself a rich kid. What does it matter? I wonder what entertainment he’s eagerly spending all his money on. On those, obviously, that are soiling our screens. That’s what’s bothering you. Go ahead, spoil him rotten. Anyway, as soon as I’ve my back turned, you throw him to the mercy of a tutor discovered under a gateway. I thought I had your tacit agreement. Tacit! What bad faith. Antoine will get on marvellously with Vittorio. Of course! This Vittorio will have plenty of misadventures to entertain him with: at the Vatican, with war criminals… What are you on about? The Vatican? War criminals? Only one thing matters to me: to protect Antoine’s still intact common sense. But what do you do? You throw him into the arms of that degenerate aristocrat who has resigned from the Papal Guard. That should reassure you, surely. Following I don’t know what gambling scandal or corruption of minors. Who, when the Reich occupied Rome, was a Fascist liaison officer, then a secret agent charged with keeping an eye on the Vatican. Who, suddenly disappeared, to be changed into a parachutist and drop from the sky, a monstrance in hand, right into the middle of the camp of Communist hostages. It’s too good to be true. What surprises me is that you’re the one dishing out all those details. What else do you want me to tell you? Your Vittorio is one of the picturesque phenomena of this century, amusing, touching for you, I agree, but disturbing once you want them to contribute to the education of a young man. What can possibly fixate willpower in goodness? Certainly not resisting temptation in order to deserve I don’t know what fantastical beatitude. It is the idea of deserving, the idea of temptation itself that I want to suppress. For that, only one course: to never regret any of our acts. That’s what I shall teach Antoine. What about the method of this charming education? Challenging him to coldly face up to its consequences. So, if ever the idea of murdering me or raping you entered his mind… Such a crazy idea, my dear, could only come to him under your influence. - And if he makes a mistake? - He will pay. Roberte, tonight. Your great mistake, Madame, is that you serve two masters, because you… Antoine, is it you? What do you want? Come down! I’m with X. He has something for you. Look out! He’s coming. What do you have for me? This. A hundred francs. But what is it? If you want to know, pay. But why a hundred francs? That’s what your tutor gave to have the other. If you want, you can feel it… Don’t worry, you won’t regret your money. Fifty francs, that’s all I have. That’ll do. Look what you made me do! Don’t you have an essay to write? You scared me! It’s late. You forgot to turn off your light. I’m hot. You have no reason to worry about your exams. All will be fine. A lot of things are troubling me. Take this. It’s a light sedative, it’ll help you sleep. I wasn’t aware you knew my friends. They told me you bought something from them. All those close to you interest me. My aunt criticizes everything I do. She criticizes the Latin tuition you give me. Your aunt has important responsibilities in all she undertakes. Everyone treats me like a child. Swallow that tablet. You need a good night’s sleep. I’m sure your aunt regrets not taking care of you as much as you deserve. Ah, Canon. I’m happy for you. You’re looked upon from high places. Really? I wouldn’t be surprised if your merits were rewarded with some honours. “Bishop in partibus”, for example. I shall support you. I really don’t understand that nomination of Roberte at the Censorship Commission. Is it a manoeuvre by the Socialists? I’m tired, cousin. Tired of a world where Madame leads the honourable fight for universal democracy and fraternity while I’m consumed by beauty, thus dying for the villains’ cause. Admit at least that you’ve done everything to condemn yourself to that solitude. I’m very worried for Antoine. He’s obsessed by a story of stolen gloves allegedly ripped from his aunt’s hands. Most vexing is that Roberte doesn’t do anything to set the story straight. How could she? She is surrounded by informers and betrayers waiting for the slightest mistake on her part to compromise her. That’s without even mentioning certain rumours that circulate almost openly. What do you mean? Papers have been seized, with indications of addresses and floors. I thought at first there were calumnies, but the news is spreading more and more in our parish youth clubs. Some of our leaders, and even younger people, boast quite openly about their exploits with a lady they all call Roberte. I would like to believe it’s only a coincidence, alas, I must admit I’m no longer so sure. Roberte is a simple heart and I made her ashamed of it. So she has contracted with the greatest simplicity what in others is but the fruit of a hideous soul. If you were nothing but a Pure Spirit, as you sometimes pretend to be at the Censorship Board, you would nonetheless be constantly assailed by thoughts more outrageous than the one you allowed yourself to have tonight. “Has Octave made me to that extent submissive to his infamous visions for me to enter straightaway the portrait he enjoys now depicting in his 'Roberte, ce soir'? Or am I reduced to live in the truth of yesterday just because it is the lie of tomorrow? To hasten his end would then remain the last, inconceivable resort. But wouldn’t that be typical of him? If I wish him dead now, it’s because he unnecessarily survives his oeuvre and prevents me living like he always wanted me to be.” “My poor Octave, why do you wish me to be so prudish? Vittorio, whom I don’t love, at least has the merit, in my eyes, of allowing me to be as I like to see myself.” Do you remember, Philippe? We had agreed to bring back to its former royal aspect, if not the whole of France, at least the Parisian region. For that, no more factories! As a result, no more red belt. Let the Jerries take away everything, send them as many men as possible. Empty France of its troublemakers, only keep the women and children, see Germany blocked with labour, and eventually choke on its industrial crises, its riots, finally rot under Moscow’s thumb. We’d trade North Africa and Indochina and sell to the highest bidder and, rich in currencies, we’d lock ourselves in our revived Syagrius kingdom. It was common sense. With a density of population carefully controlled, we’d become again an artisan civilization, a manual civilization! Eh! Manual in many skills. Paris would become inaccessible! It would be impossible to find a job in Paris, where only families who’d lived there for a minimum of seventy-five years would be allowed to reside. Few young men, but girls and women in abundance, and many old men. A well-organized poverty, clean, benefiting from a modest life, a dwindling working class, destined to disappear with the last factories. As for Paris, it’d only be libraries, museums and shows. For a century, the old men have saved this country. The petulant youth ruined it. It was never generosity that was a creative force in the social life of our country, but suspicion, malicious gossip, denunciation, cold-blooded malice, that’s what made us grow up with the most perfect contempt for our fellow beings. All virtues that only blossom with the coldness of old age. To teach the young there is nothing more important than preparing for their old age, if they can reach it. To stay sober and continent. Then, with all the pent-up vitality, all the sperm hoarded as much as the money, carried by the change of life, to enjoy the golden sunset of life. What is it? It’s a stone, Uncle. It was thrown from the street. Go and see what’s happening. “Your paintings are fakes. They are all in cahoots. Enough!" Signed, Frédéric Tonnerre. Would those fakes be real then? I can’t see anyone, Uncle. If she has already taken part in… Let her take part one more time. Let her pose for a last tableau, a tableau vivant this time. So I shall know finally. Don’t move! How shameful. I can still see. I shall always see. Peace, finally. But is it possible? Octave has been recalled by his God. What alleviating miracle could drag from me more sincere, more joyful thanks? God, if you exist against all evidence, you have saved me from my final blunder, and my father the pastor wouldn’t fail to say: “You won’t be tempted beyond your strength”. But though I can’t bring myself to believe in the supreme judge, it’s more difficult for me still to believe Octave is dead. Beyond the grave, he spies on me. Am I to remain his walk-on part forever? Am I to let myself take part in posthumously staged scenes, to strain my ear for his applause? Or could it be the disappearance of his gaze that suddenly takes me by surprise? Excuse me. I’m happy to go to Rome with Antoine. So much beauty and gentleness will help him bloom. I took upon myself to prepare your luggage and his in that very spirit. I hope he’ll like the outfit I chose for you. Antoine freely expects only one thing that I’m called upon to freely satisfy. And since life is no longer a spectacle, it starts all over again, seriously and solemnly. And more seriously still as it’s a matter of educating a lover. There’s no light? If you allow me? Here I am, alone, restored to myself, and there won’t be those perpetual comments on my gestures, on my movements. But since life must resume, let me find once more that turning where I left myself some fifteen years ago. That glimpse in my life that I dread is from now on even more frightening. ROMAN IMPRESSIONS Continuation and end More. Your cool hand is so soft and soothing. - What is that key? - This key opens the tabernacle where a list is hidden. The Allies are coming! The Allies are coming! Schwester, let me see your breasts… What harm could it do? Very well… but first, give me the key! This list… is it the one with the Jewish children? And the convents where Vittorio has hidden them! - To think I was supposed to kidnap him. - “Him”? Pius XII, can you imagine! To take him as hostage to Nuremberg. That list means a hanging for me… on the spot! Earlier, my angel, you promised me something. Help! Leave me alone! Help! You little spy! Perfumed and powdered to arouse the wounded, to make war prisoners talk. You procuress of the gallows! Forgive me! I didn’t want that! How’s that? For once you wouldn’t have anything to regret… It’s you, Roberte, I’m afraid, who’ll be so strong as never to regret anything… We who don’t regret anything, our day will also come! - What’s he shouting? - The Pope is dead.
