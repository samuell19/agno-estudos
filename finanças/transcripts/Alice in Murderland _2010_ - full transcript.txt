The loft is beautiful, Miss Glass. I can't believe you'd sell it with everything in it. I can't believe someone so young can afford to buy it. My family is wealthy. Louis is your family name? You can call me Anne. The rich tend to run in the same circle. Do your parents share the same last name? No, I'm recently married. I have a one year old. We just moved here to raise our kid in a nice town. Who said it was a nice town? Can we look at the kitchen? This way. I'm afraid the kitchen is not too impressive. I'm not much of a cook. It's fine. I like the idea of living in a place like this. Lots of bedrooms and bathrooms, a big loft, an office. Yeah, you should see the basement. Lots of strange stuff down there. There is storage for Sewing machines, a bathroom. Why sewing machines? My mom fixed and repaired them and now, I have to get rid of them, or the new owner will. You seem really young to have a child. I turn 21 today. Wouldn't this loft be a wonderful birthday present? Sure, so is it a boy or a girl? A girl, I have a little girl. Alice. Alice? You know if you'll excuse me there's something I have to attend to but feel free to inspect the kitchen, and go upstairs, Oh, and the basement. I think you'll find a nice surprise in the basement. Miss Glass? Is that you? Hey Alice. Alice! Hey! Snap out of it! I was just thinking about my mother. She died when she was 21 and I turn 21 this Saturday. I know! It's your birthday! That's why I'm here! We're gonna plan the whole thing! I don't think we should do anything for Alice's birthday, we didn't do anything for my birthday. Hmm, I think that's because you're a bitch. But everybody loves Alice. You shouldn't talk to Tiffany that way, Mallory. It's just rude. You have a summer birthday Tiffany, we celebrate them all on the last day of school. I don't do sharing. Yeah, we don't do sharing. Lets go. Hey! Um, I'm sorry, Mallory! I'm in, for any party. And I'll bring the drugs. You can bring the drugs, Pima, just don't bring those crazy mushrooms. My shrooms are kick ass. Hey! We should have a themed party. That's a bad idea. No, I was thinking, we could have an Alice In Wonderland themed party. Oh, I hate Alice in Wonderland. It freaks me out. I'm in! Oh, perfect, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum. I don't get it. Hey, Kat, I was thinking, you could be the Cheshire Cat because you're always disappearing. Yeah and you always have that goofy smile on your face, even when you don't try one of my kickass shrooms. Okay Pima, you haven't been here long enough to know who I am. Let me guess, Mallory White, you will be the White Rabbit. I should be Alice because I have the perfect hair for it. No, I think you should be the Red Queen. The Red Queen? Okay, I can live with that. You'll be great as the Queen, Tiff. I know. Ok, so guess what? My uncle just bought the Glass place and we could ask him if we could have the party there. Alice? Alice, are you okay? I need to see my Aunt Lena. The Glass place is where Alice's mother was murdered. Probably not the best place for a party for Alice. There's my favorite baby face. Alice? Everything okay? Aunt Lena, what happened to my parents? You know what happened. Yeah, but nobody has talked to me about it since I was like, twelve. It's not easy to talk about. Whatever. Well, you know your mom was found dead. At the Glass place? She was looking at it. I think she wanted to buy it. She couldn't afford it of course. She just wanted to see it. And they never found the killer? Your father was never found and the owner of the Glass House disappeared. Police figured one or the other was the killer. Could my father have really killed my mother? Your mom was my older sister, ya know. She was so sweet. Just like you. Your father was okay. Not good enough for her, in my opinion. But I don't think he did it. I always figured he found the body then was murdered by Charlene Glass who then ran away. But why? Honey, I wish I could give you more answers but nobody really knows what went on that night. Twenty years ago this Saturday. Yeah. What was she like? You look a lot like her. She was beautiful. All the guys teased her, but she was pretty shy. She was strong though, brave. Strength of character. Never afraid of the next challenge. And was always there for me, always there for her friends. Hey Guys. Oh hey, Valerie! I'll let you guys do your thing. Hey, you doing okay? I'm good. I wanna go to the party this Saturday. Good. It's Charline Glass. I'm at the Glass Place right now. Do I think it's wise? Answer this, do you think it's wise that you sold this place to some Renee White? Who is she anyway. It's a man? A professor at that shitty college? Look, there's something you need to know. Please, have a seat Andrew. Tell me what's on your mind. Well, uh, Mr. White. I need to retake my last test. As I recall, you missed my art appreciation class on the day I gave the test. Right, so uh, I need to take it again. Do you have a good reason for why you weren't in that day? Say, a doctors note? Or a death in the family? Yeah, that's it, a death in the family. Oh, very sorry to hear about that, Andrew. Yeah, I'll be okay. Who died? What? It's a simple question. Which of your family members passed away causing you to miss my exam. Man, what difference does it make? Just give me the stupid test already. Well, if I had to give you a stupid test that is something I'm certain you would pass. What? I saw you in the class that takes place right after the one you missed. So I'm to believe that this funeral you attended for the as of yet to be named family member just conveniently lasted for the duration of your art appreciation class? Look, if I don't retake the test, I might fail. If I fail, you fail. Are you threatening me? Look, screw the test, just makes sure I get a C in the class. What's going on here, Andrew? Your boyfriend is threatening me, Mallory. I thought I told you to leave my uncle alone. Look, just makes sure I pass the class. I'm sorry about that, Uncle Renee. I have never approved of your selection of young mates, Mallory. But, I do admit, I'm very fond of you. And I'm very fond of you. Can I ask you something? Is it urgent? I have to get to another class soon. No, not really. I'll catch you later. But, just think about this. Alice in Wonderland. Oooh, I'm intrigued. Good. Dee! Dee, wake up. Did you hear that? Dee! Dee! Donna! Are you in here? Hello. Dee, why are you sleeping on the counter? Oh god, oh, Dee, I had a nightmare about Alice in Wonderland. Go to bed, brain dead. Brain dead? Hey, are you making fun of me? You're insulting me, aren't you? Hey, I figured that one out all by myself. Who's the smart one now? So here's the deal, we're having a party for Alice and it's her 21st birthday party so it's gotta be really special and I was wondering if we could use your new place. The Glass Building? I heard it's amazing. Mallory, that's probably not a really good idea. Why not? Well for one, the loft isn't ready yet. And it's not a house so to speak. I mean, it's got junk all over the place and in the rooms. There's sewing machines stored in the basement. Well we can have the party in the loft, so what if it's empty? It's in a bad part of town, over by the junk yard. Did I mention you're invited? You mean, I'm invited to a party at my own place? Ok, did I mention it's an Alice in Wonderland party? Really? You really are great friends with Alice aren't you? Yes, she's my best friend forever. Do you have a Mad Hatter yet? Yes. You! Come on, Uncle Renee, come on, who else can play the Mad Hatter, huh? So? So I just spoke to my uncle and he said we can use the place as long as he can play the Mad Hatter. I heard the place is by an old junkyard. It is, but he's totally fixing it up. Oh, and there's a big room that he's turning into a theater and I think we could use it for the party. I've always wanted to see the glass place. Hey sorry, I forgot my key. It's okay. So check it out. Everything is in place. We just need to figure out who to invite and what characters they're going to go as. I thought I heard Kat's voice. Where is she? She's right... Kat! She was right here. She's the perfect Cheshire Cat. Always disappearing. Hey, if you gotta room with someone for 4 years, she's perfect. Hardly there. I don't get how she can be a psychology major though, she doesn't even talk that much. Oh, she talks enough. So um, do you wanna invite guys? No guys. Yeah. Who wants their ex boyfriend at their birthday party, huh? Is it okay if Andrew doesn't come? Yeah, he's on my shit list anyway. I know he's going to try to get in, but I'll just make sure he doesn't. Do you really think the whole no guys thing will really work? It's possible. With everyone except for Tiffany. But my Uncle does have to be there though. He's cool. Some people don't even consider him a guy. I'm pretty much cool with anyone you want to invite. Let's just keep it simple though. So, sorority sisters. Sounds good to me, but how will that go over with Tiffany? I heard no guys at the party. Can you believe that? Just because I date Alice's ex boyfriend. It's not my fault he finally got good taste. I know, you're way hotter than Alice. Matt! What are you doing? I saw Alice coming through the front door so I know I'm not supposed to see her since we broke up. I want you to come to the party on Saturday. But I thought it was females only. Don't be such a pussy, Matt. What? Oh look, your shoelace is untied. Look, I like to please you, do you like to please me? I sort of don't think my shoelace was really untied. Just, just come to the party on Saturday. Kay? I'll make sure you can stay. And I will guarantee that you have a good time. Will you wear the special panties, the one's that say.. Look, let's keep what they say a little secret, okay? I think it might not be that big of a.. You leave the thinking to me. I'll make sure we get guys at the party. No guys and it's final. Um, I think we should vote. Ok, who votes to have guys at Alice's 21st birthday party making her miserable with Tiffany hanging off Alice's ex, Matt. Ok, who votes no guys? It's all about the Alice. Thanks, it means a lot you guys. What about your Uncle Renee? He may have a girls name, but he's a guy. Well it's his place so he will obviously be there. He ain't much of a guy, anyway. So, I have a list of everybody's costume right there in the kitchen. I want you guys to go in there and once you get your costumes, I'm going to send them ahead to my uncle's place. It would be cool if we didn't bring cell phones. Right, no cell phones. Any cell phones that get brought inside will be confiscated by Kat. Kat, I'm going to make you the enforcer. I can do that, if I find one I will smash it. Ok, my phone costs more than your education. You're not smashing it. If you don't want it smashed, don't bring it. You ain't really gonna make me and Donna Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, are you? Well actually, yes, I am. Right, oh my gosh so I had this nightmare last night about the Mad Hatter and he killed Dee and me. I mean, he didn't really kill us because we're sitting here but I think it's some kind of warning. Like, some warning that that Mad Hatter is gay? I guess we'll be Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum anyway. Isn't anyone going to dress as the Jabberwocky. Hm, I'm surprised you even knew that the Jabberwocky was in the Alice stories. No, no Jabberwocky. I thought I heard someone down here. Andrew, you have some explaining to do. I'm here for the party. First of all, the party isn't tonight, it's tomorrow night. So I'm early, sue me. Secondly, there are no men invited to the party. Except for me of course. Yeah right, okay, whatever. You don't really care if I'm here, plus Mallory is my girlfriend. That's not how I see things. So what are you doing here anyway? Making traps? This looks dangerous. Come on, Man, it's just a joke, Man. It's not even real, see? Just pretend you never saw me. They'll all die laughing. You'll see. I'd like to see you leave right now. I'd like to see you make me leave. We'll have the police sort this out. I'm leaving, Asshole. Good riddence. Ok Ladies, put your homework away. It's time to finalize the details for tonight's party. So, I took the liberty of sending all your costumes to the Glass House already. Um, not mine. I still have mine. Well, I guess you'll just have to bring yours yourself. So, what's the plan? Okay. Sure, we can all drive there and park in the back ally, but I thought it would be more fun to hike through the junk yard. The junk yard is kind of creepy. Yeah, and if I didn't get there before dark, I would blow junks. Oh my gosh, I made a pun! What pun? I said blow junks and it's a junk yard! If you hike through the junk yard at night there are all sorts of things you wouldn't see until it's too late. Yeah, but it would be an adventure and then we would try to have to get there before dark. So who's with me? Pathetic. I can't believe only two of your sisters came out to hike with us. I'm just doing it for the shrooms. What? I here they grow wild here. I don't think anyone is going to smoke anything you find in this junkyard, Pina. Hey, you never know! It just depends how bad the party is. Ok, I'll be honest. I'm kind of scared about going to the Glass place. Ok, I thought it would be cooler. This place is so ghetto. What's with all the bars on the window? Let's knock. Did you hear that? I think someone is following us. I don't see anyone. Come on guys, let's go. Come on. Where is this guy? Come on. Oh, where's Mallory? And the guest of honor? The lovely Alice. They decided to walk through the junkyard to get here. My, my sounds dangerous. Hope they get here before dark. Oh, please come in girls. We're almost there. Oh, hurray, you girls made it before dark! Please come in. There were three floors here. Here's the staircase that leads to the basement, but don't go down there. Back there is the stairway that leads up to the loft. And right through here, I've locked this door up. This is where Andrew broke in. The theater is right this way. Well I'm converting this area into a theater. This will be the stage of course. I'll have some chairs right through here. Then we could put on some stage plays. Isn't that exciting? Yes. Ok. Well, happy unbirthday to everyone! Except Alice of course. Ok guys, uh your costumes are in that suitcase over there! So, lets try them on! Guess that's my cue to step out. Give that back to me. You know the rule! No cell phones. I am warning you. Yeah, give me your best shot! Give it to me right now freakazoid! It's all yours! Well that's perfect, because ya know, the Red Queen dress keeps falling off. We don't get to see thong. That's cause she's not the Red Queen yet, silly. Off with your legs! Give it back! That hurt! Had enough, Tiff! No! What's going on here? Cat fight! That's good. I don't get it. Cat fight. Her name's Kat and she's in a cat fight. I stil don't get it. I have a strange feeling about this place. Something seems wrong. Oh, I caught Andrew setting traps last night. I'm sorry, I must have missed that one. There's a bathroom right around the corner with extra towels. You know what, I'll go with her. Cat fight, ah I get it! You girls need to be careful about these traps, I don't know how many he set before I caught him. Boring. Do you have a cell phone that I can borrow, Mr. Black? It's White. Whatever. Actually, Andrew knocked away my cell phone during a scuffle we had last night in the sewing room in the basement. I haven't been able to find it yet. You got into a scuffle with Andrew? Hey, what's a scuffle? Is that like something in a porno or... You have a sewing room? Yeah, there's all these old sewing machines in the basement. I guess there mine now. I'm going to find somewhere else to change. You can stay here and change, Samantha. Actually, it probably doesn't matter much. But if you don't mind leaving so we can finish changing. Oh, of course. This place is really freaking you out, isn't it. I'll be fine, I need to have a good time right? Yeah, it's your 21st birthday, you gotta have a party that's off the chart. Did you bake me a cake? No, but if you're good I won't make you wear a stupid pointy birthday hat. Dork. Geezer. Slut. Virgin. We're supposed to be having the time of our lives. It's the last year of college. That's what my Aunt Lena says at least. I'm loving it, are you not? I don't know. I shouldn't worry too much. What am I going to do after I graduate? What am I going to do with a music degree? Teach? I'm not right for that. Hm... You're right. You think I'd make a bad teacher? No, I don't know about that. I just mean you're right, you worry too much. Okay, look. Why don't you just put this on? The sun has gone down and the moon is up. It's time to take Alice through the looking glass. Oh, you girls look simply lovely! Fabulous! Bravo! One and all. I thought you were supposed to be in a caterpillar costume? Have you ever tried to buy a caterpillar costume? They're like 200 bucks. Besides, caterpillars turn into butterflies and costumes are way cheaper. Well, more money for drugs. Right on. Aren't you supposed to be the white rabbit? Yeah, but see I find black to be much more flattering. And they ran out of white rabbit costumes. Where's the red bitch? I think you mean Red Queen, Dear. She had to take care of some business, she'll be back soon. Kinda worried about her. You're worried about Tiffany? I think we should go look for her. Alice is right, she's a sister. Hey, let's try to find her. We'll split up, we'll find her faster. Does that mean Dee and me have to split up, too? Dee and I. You're splitting up with Dee, too? Why don't we all just take 10 minutes and we'll meet back right here. Um, question, if we don't have our cell phones how will we know it's been 10 minutes. What took you so long? Most of the windows have bars on them. There's a ladder, I used it to climb up to that window and it took me a while to get in. Hmm, I've heard that one before. I really think this is a bad idea, Tiffany. No, come on, I even wore those special panties that you like just for you. Really? Yeah, if you play your cards right I'll let you see them around my ankles. I feel bad for Alice though. Come on, she broke up with you, right? I don't know, I guess so. She just is so deep, dark. I don't know. It's just, maybe.. Less talk, more action. Alice. I'm sorry. Oh come on, Alice. I know Mallory said no guys, but what's a party with no guys. I was going to keep the necklace you gave me, Matt, but now I don't want it. You keep it Alice. You two are pathetic. You know, I thought I can convert you, Matt, make you fun. But you're a terminal loser. I miss you. There's something strange about this place. You know, it's where my mother was murdered 20 years ago this day. Then why even come here? Especially now? I don't know. Maybe, you know, if I could just get through the night it would change everything. I would get over it. I should go, I shouldn't be here. Is there something you want to tell me, Matt? Um, see ya around. Alice, is that you? What's with the costume? I told you to keep the necklace, please! You want me to spill my guts? Is that what you want? It's what all you chicks want. Fine. I loved you. I just went with Tiffany to make you jealous. I know she only dates me to make you angry. I thought maybe we could get back together. Say something. You want more? You want me to spill my guts more? Oh god, Freak! You scared the crap out of me. Funny right? So did you find Tiffany? No, and I think our 10 minutes are up. So uh, where is everyone? Don't know! Wanna get high? I can't believe you have that shit here! Yeah, I got the connect. Besides, if you want guys, eat one shroom and you will see the man of your dreams. I don't feel anything and I don't see no dudes. Give it time. Everybody's been looking for you, what have you been up to? Looks like you were just putting your costume back on so I could ask you the same thing. It's none of your business. Ditto. Okay. Well, we should get back to the theater because this party is about to be wild. Look at all the pretty lights, these will be great for when we put on plays! Can we play some music or something? Oh, I haven't set up the record player yet. What's a record player? You have speakers right there. Those are for the theater when I get that set up. I can rig them to my iPod. I have a better idea. How about we all play charades? You know what, I'd rather play Russian roulette. I didn't know you were Russian! This party is so lame, I can't believe you guys didn't want to have guys here. It's so stupid. Right, so you invite Alice's ex boyfriend. That's exactly the reason we didn't want to invite guys. Oh no, actually, you're the reason. You know what, I don't need to be here. I can find plenty more exciting things to do. Like, washing my dishes. We're sisters, you're staying. I'm warning you, don't you ever touch me again. In the Alice in Wonderland book, they have a tea party. Why not have a tea party? That's what they do before they cut their heads off. Off with their heads. Alice, are you okay? Is she going psycho or something? Kat, you're the psych major, what's going on? You want my opinion? Yeah. Well, Alice knows her mom was murdered here 20 years ago on this very date and they never found the killer. And her father disappeared on the same day meaning he either killed her mother or he was murdered and they never found the body. That would be enough to traumatize anyone. Hm, makes sense. I mean they might not all be freaky like Alice. She's not freaky, just introspective. I'm right here, I can hear you guys. Yeah, but now add into play the rumors. Maybe someone was having an affair with her mother. The murder, or murders could have had something to do with a psychotic jealous rage. Alice is at the very scene of the crime, meant to realize some horrific destiny. I'd say that would make you fucking weird. Ok, nice diagnosis Freud. Hey, I haven't even graduated yet. That's the best I've got. Way to kill the party buzz, Kat. Oh, it was dead a long time ago. Come on Samantha, we're finished here. Yeah, we're finished here. Oh, I warned you. You bitch! Oh, what's wrong? What's the matter? Girls, please! Nice undies. It's hard to imagine you with an open backdoor. I'm not leaving, I'm just taking the fun party upstairs. Anyone else who likes to have fun can join me. Hey, Alice, want a mushroom? No, thanks, I don't do drugs. Yeah, I'm going upstairs. Whoa, the mushroom just hit me. Wait, so I'm confused, is the party upstairs or downstairs? The party is where the mushrooms be. Upstairs. I don't get it, should we just leave? No, I have a plan. We'll call it "Tiffany's revenge party." So, what happens now? I could pour you some tea if you'd really like some, Alice. Yes please, I would. Ladies? Yeah, please. Oh sure, why not. I'll live on the edge. Ok, so we're going to set up the traps and if we're lucky, they'll blame Andrew. My hat's green. Who is she talking to? Oh, no worries, it's just the shrooms. I think she's hallucinating. Oh, thank god. I totally thought Dee was talking to me and I really wasn't following her at all. She's saying something about the Mad Hatter but I'm not the Mad Hatter and Mr. White is totally the Mad Hatter. I'm Tweedle Dum, or Tweedle Dee? Ok, we need some rope or string or something. Does anyone have anything like that? Oh, I've got floss. About 200 yards. What? I floss a lot. Shrooms get stuck in your teeth. Those mushrooms are disgusting. I just need to prepare them better. I'm going to clean them and take off all the bad spots. I think Dee got a gnarly one. Yeah, well they smell like armpits. Do them in another room. Dum, I'm Tweedle Dum. Ok, take her with you. Yeah, take her with you. Come on genius. My hat is green. I'm not sure if I've ever had tea. Do you think I should try it? Sure, it's your birthday and today's horoscope said it's a good day to try new things. Definitely. So, Pima, how did you get to be so smart? What? Who says I'm smart? What, I've seen you studying! You know all sorts of stuff about junk. Oh, I read a lot. Do you read much? Read much what? What's your major? Oh, it's undeclared. Wait, you're a senior. How could your major be undeclared? I don't know, it's been like that a long time. How long have you been a senior? Hm, six, seven, nine? Nine months? No, nine years. My parents pay and the sorority lets me stay here. Sometimes, I even pass my classes. I think that's impossible, Donna. Hey, my grandma said anythings possible if you put your mind to it. You're a chemistry major, right? Yeah, really impressed you remembered that! I just decided to make my major it so I could fully appreciate chemicals. As they pertain to partying. I just like making people feel like they could just let go, just really explore... Pima, can you just stop talking? My head is kind of hurting. Did you want one of my shrooms? Is it going to make me like Dee? I think she had a bad one, but this one should be good. Am I high? I can't tell. So ugh, let me get you some more tea! Where's the Cheshire cat? She was here a second ago. She must just be doing her thing. She really shouldn't be wondering around the place by herself with all the traps Andrew set. Ya know what, I'm going to go ahead and look for her. You two stay right here. Alright, they're clean now! Who wants some of my shrooms? No. No. They're coming up fine. Who? I know he's coming. He won't hurt Donna, I love Donna. She's stupid. She's actually dumber than dirt. But I still love her. What are you looking for, Tiff. Something heavy to fall on their heads. Oh. I think that's way too heavy. What do you think, Donna? I think Dee's talking about me. Oh Donna, you've got a smudge on your nose. Here, let me get that for you. Thanks. Okay, well... Who wants to try one of my magical mushrooms? Let go of me! Mad Hatter! Mad Hatter! Dee, Dee stop it! Let her go! Oh, sorry about that! I thought you were the Mad Hatter. Nobody wants one of your messed up mushrooms. Take Dee to the bathroom and fix this problem, Pima! What am I supposed to do? I don't know, you got her like this! Just make her like us! Well, don't make her like me. I mean, she's already kind of like me. Just hurry. Go with Pima, there you go. Ugh, ooh. I don't like that look. Come on, we just need to make it to the bathroom in one piece. Mad Hatter! Mad Hatter! Dee, I'm not the Mad Hatter! Mad Hatter! You bit me! You were trying to kill me! I'm really freaked out! You thought I was the Mad Hatter! I'm really scared of the Mad Hatter! My mom used to read me and Donna the story when we were kids. He's so creepy, you know! Okay, let's just get you something to eat and maybe you'll feel better. I can't believe you bit my leg. I'm all about the survival. I'm the kind of person that does whatever it takes. Nothing personal. So what are you afraid of? Nothing. Well, maybe everything. Some of the other girls in the sorority had it easy growing up. Not me. What about you? I've always been the bad ass chick. Getting in fights for saying whatever I want. If you're ugly or stupid I ain't afraid to remind you. I tell it like it is, I'm not afraid to speak the truth. Mad Hatter! Mad Hatter! Damn! You bit me again! We need to find that bathroom. Now. Miss Glass, I must confess something. I really can't afford to buy this place. I just wanted to see it. I know, you gave birth to Alice and that has changed everything. I don't understand. Your husband no longer loves you, he wants you dead. I want you dead. No. Your husband loves someone else. I'm sorry, but you have to go. No, I need to raise Alice. I need to be there for her. If I'm not, there's no telling what will happen to her. I think you know exactly what will happen to her. I fell asleep, sorry. Why didn't you wake me up? It looked like you were having more fun sleeping. Hasn't turned out to be such a fun party after all. Sorry, I should have let you invite guys. It's okay, you know a bunch of guys running around in Alice in Wonderland costumes wouldn't be too hot anyway. Where does Kat go when she disappears like this? You know, I have no idea. She's been my roommate for 4 years and I feel like I hardly know her. I think something happened to her mother, too, but, she never talks about it. I think that's why she's a psych major, try to cure her crazy. I don't think Kat's crazy. No crazier than I am at least. What do you think happened to your mother? I don't know. I kind of... I'm sorry, I shouldn't have mentioned your mother. You know what, let's talk about Tiffany. I didn't see you snap that photo of her! Tiffany is going to hate that! I know, and guess what, I'm going to put that on YouTube, and Facebook, and whatever other technology I can get my hands on! You're a good friend, Mal. I love you, too Sweetie. So, I'm going to take a quick trip to the little girls room and if Kat comes back before I do, keep an eye on her and do not let her out of your sight. I will guard her with my life, black rabbit. Ok. I can't believe you bit me again. What are you some type of cannibal? What do I look like now? Hm, a talking giant bumble bee. Ok, you need water. Let's get in the shower. Taking clothes off. Oh, wait, crazy cold. I think I'm turning back. I'm coming back. Good, okay. What do I look like now? Wait there's um, two of you. Pima wearing a butterfly costume and it looks like jabberwocky. I'm not afraid of you, Jabberwocky. You're not really there. But if you were there, damn, you're one ugly son of a bitch. Isn't anyone going to help me? Help you what? I'm working on setting up a trap. Get a clue. Oh, glue? There's glue right here. It's the strongest glue ever. You could totally use it. It's not violent enough. Well, what's your plan? I'm going to rig this door so that when someone walks in, something falls on their head. Mallory's head. Except I want something more dramatic to happen. Like, um, electricity. You know, shock her, too. I could rig wire on the door and put water on the floor for when she comes in. Your engineering degree finally comes in handy. Don't just stand here, get to work on it. Hey, doesn't it seem like Dee has been gone a long time? She was pretty messed up, I'm sure she's fine. You okay? Yeah. Any sign of Kat? Nope. Your potty break wasn't so quick. Yeah, well you don't wanna know about that. Did you take pictures? Oh, a joke. You must feeling better. I'm kinda worried about, she's been gone a long time. Where have you been? You know how I get about messes. That basement is truly a mess. I'm certainly going to have to do something about it. So you didn't find her? No, I'm afraid not. Find who? Ok, I really hate it when you do that. How long have you been sitting there? Long enough to appreciate that I was missed. Look really guys, you really don't have to worry about me. I was just checking the place out. This place is a legend. Oh you like? So any words from the bad girls? They're upstairs in the loft. Probably up to no good. You guys I am super duper worried about Dee. Have I told you that? Like a million times. Why don't you go look for her? Yeah, that's a good idea. Okay. I think it's all done. If you flip the switch on that lamp chord it should send juice to the door knob. Just leave it off when you want it safe. And I've got the brick set to fall when the door swings open. Go downstairs and get Mallory and Alice, make sure it's only those two. How can I do that? You'll manage. Just don't screw this up. You can count on me, my Red Queen. Um, penguin? Charlie Chaplin? The tramp? The crying game? Girls, Girls. You're supposed to be guessing Alice in Wonderland characters. Tiffany needs to see you right way, but just Mallory and Alice. Is there something wrong? I should help. It's a chick thing! And I'm not a chick? Trust me, she needs to see Mallory and Alice and just them. For them, this will be shocking. Alright, let's do this. Alright, I guess it's tea time then. I'm quite the little expert on Alice in Wonderland actually. As a matter of fact, it was written in 1865 by Lewis Caroll and ugh, many people think it was Lewis Caroll but that was actually a pseudonym for Charles Ludwig Dodgson, the author's real name. And, oh, heavens. Missing again. I'm certainly going to have to do something about this. Well, go on in. You first. So this is your big surprise? A brick falling on your flunkey's head? I'm not a flunkey. Yes you are, your stupid trap didn't even work. Ow! On second thought, I'm really glad you guys dragged us up here because this is entertaining. Would you say it's more entertaining than playing Alice in Wonderland charades. Oh, I'd say it's close. Where is everyone? Pima went to help Dee come down from her mushroom high, Donna went to go check up on them. Help! God, I'm stuck. What do you mean you're stuck? Well this guy in this dragon mask came in and he grabbed my head and knocked me out and Dee is dead! She's right there in the shower. She's not there! Where is the body? I don't know, can't you just help get me up? Please just pull. Ow, Ow, Ow. What are you trying to do rip my skin off? Okay, okay okay. We'll go downstairs and get you some help. Yeah, be sure to stick around. Ha ha ha, but what if the dragon guy comes back? Here, spray him with this. We'll be back soon, don't worry. Yeah, I won't worry. Where's my uncle? I don't know, I went for a pee break and he was gone when I got back. Ok, we need to use his cell phone because Dee might be dead. What? What are you talking about? Donna said that she saw Dee dead in the shower and there is lots of blood, there's no body, but her clothes are still there. Oh my god, where's Donna? Glued to the toilet. Of course she is. Ok, so we need to find my uncle so we could use his cell phone and call the police. He said his phone was lost in the basement and no one else here has a cell phone except me,but some idiot smashed mine to bits. Yeah, way to go. Ok, who drove? We took my car. Ok, perfect, you and Sam go to find help and then we will try to find my uncle, we will unglue Donna from the toilet, and we will find Pima and get the hell out of here. Finally, you say something that makes sense. The door must be locked, does anyone have a key? We lost the key! Well then what about a window? All the windows have bars on them, we need to find my uncle and ask him! Are you sure you want to find him? Maybe he's doing all this. He wouldn't hurt a fly. Well then who, who would do this? How about Charlene Glass? Who? She was the owner of the building, very creepy from what I hear. She was the one who showed Alice's mother around 20 years ago and she was in the house when Alice's mother was murdered and she's never been heard from again. So that makes sense because it's 20 years later and because I'm here! No, that doesn't makes sense because how would she she know that you're here? I say it's Mr. White. My mom told me that Alice's dad freaked out after he heard about the murders. He just disappeared. Maybe it was him. My mom she told me that Alice's dad was jealous and that her mom.. Ok, ok, can we all just shut the fuck up? We need to get out of here now. You heard the lady, Tiffany and Samantha, why don't you guys go upstairs and look for Mr. White and check on Donna. Mallory, Alice go downstairs and look for Mr. Whites cell phone. And what are you gonna do? I'm gonna go check this level for a window with no bars and look for Mr. White. By yourself? Do you have a better idea? Works for me, come on Sam. Mr. White, are you down here? Ok, we need to find that cell phone. I'll look over here. This is like looking for a needle in a hay stack. Ow. Well, found a needle. Ow! Why are you doing this to me? Help! Help! What? That was Donna screaming, don't even pretend you didn't hear her! So what are we supposed to do? Run into the bathroom and get ourselves killed? She's our sister, I'm going to help her. Did you hear something that sounded like a scream? No, did you? I don't know. We gotta find that phone. Oh my gosh, child, what happened? I'm stuck to the toilet seat, please you need to get me off. Get you off? Yeah, just pull my chest. Pull your chest to get you off? Just do it. Oh, oh. Ok come on, harder. Ok. Harder, harder. Oh my lord, child let me help you. I can do it, I can do it. Oh, of course, of course. This must be very embarrassing, I would imagine. Em-bare-assing? Are you trying to be funny? Me? Funny? I don't think so. Oh. I'm sorry, I'll give you your privacy. Okay, I'm sure I heard a scream, come on. Oh, Donna. Oh gosh, my butt got ripped off, and I'm bleeding, and my panties got torn. Oh here, use these. Did they tell you Dee's dead? Someone is running around killing everybody and I don't know what's going on. I know, look your good as new. Ouch! I'm sorry. Gotcha! Oh my god! Oh Lord! Kat? She was so nice. Hm, I think my butt stopped bleeding. Why Kat, why would you do this? Screw that, how do we get out of here. Oh, you don't get out, I kill you one by one. Alice is last. Me? My mother was the one that killed your mother. It was all about your father, the man they both loved. Kat, you've been my roommate for like, four years and I never knew you were like this. You're crazy. You people see what you wanna see. So what happened to my father? I don't know. He left, I imagined. He probably moved somewhere and changed his name. You see, everyone wants to believe that they're someone else, not who they really are. That's what I've struggled with since I found my mom hanging in our living room. And then I read and destroyed her suicide note. You don't need to listen to this Alice, we don't need to listen to this bull shit. I have finally come to terms with who I am, my mother's daughter. A killer. And Alice, your mother is the one who triggered my mother and you're the one who triggered me. Look at me, Alice. You can sense this is our destiny. You knew it from the moment you entered this house, didn't you? Tell me how to get out of here or I will rip your head off. You're the Red Queen, off with my head. We need to calm down and think, violence never solves anything. No, we need to find a way out of here. So let's look. Alright, you four go look. Samantha and I will stay with Kat. Maybe she will tell us something. Ok, don't do anything crazy. So this is what you use to kill? Sometimes. I also used a knife, an axe. Mixed it up a little for variety. Remember Tiff, we're not supposed to do anything crazy. Tell me how to get out of here. You really wanna know? Oh, I thought you were just insane, are you stupid, too? Of course I wanna know. Come closer, I'll tell you. No, you can just tell me from here. No, I'll tell you, just not Samantha. Those are my terms. The only way you'll get out is in a body bag! What are you laughing at? Sorry, I thought it that was kinda funny. There's a bathroom, down the hall and around the corner. There's a small window in there with no bars. One of you might be able to squeeze through. How about we use this? Ok, put that down that's not gonna help. Um... Let's use the window. Help me get it open. I'm gonna go through there. Maybe I should do it. What are you saying I'm fatter than you? No, I'm just saying maybe I should.. Shut up, I'll do it, okay? Give me a hand. Okay, I'm stuck. Okay, fine, I'll push you. Ow, that's not working. Okay, how about I pull you? Ow, that's not working either. Ok, I'm not being nice anymore. I'm going to cut you up until you tell me how to get out of here alive and not in some body bag. Wait, wait don't hurt her Tiffany she's my sister. Don't be stupid Samantha, she wants to kill us. No, you don't understand. She's really my sister. Four years I followed Mallory around just to be close to Alice's best friend. Samantha stayed close to you. Listened to your whining. Made you think I gave a shit about what you said or what you did. God, you are such a pompous arrogant bitch. Yeah, if Samantha wasn't crazy already, you finished the job. That's for everything I had to put up with from you. That's it sis, four years of Tiffany's crap and you repay her with one tiny kick? Better, but... Tell me again, Sis, what is it that the red queens always say? Off with their heads. Say it again, like you mean it! Off with their heads! Now show me! Hole in one, you're good. Now let's go see if we can get some of those others up here. Let's hear your best scream! It won't budge. What should I do? Just go ahead without me, you know where to find me. What was that scream, child? Where's Mallory? She's stuck, but she's okay. We need to go upstairs and see what happened. Where did everybody go? What happened? Kat got loose somehow, she killed Tiffany. I tried to stop her but she hit me with the bat. I think she's headed for the theater. She's not here. We need to find her before she hurts someone else. Is someone there? Alice? Is that you? My butt still hurts. Gosh, you are not Alice. You want more of that super glue? That whole glue your ass to the toilet seat thing is pretty hilarious, don't you think? I didn't think it was funny at all. And you're not a very nice person, you killed a lot of our sisters. I didn't kill you. You tried. By gluing your ass, you think I tried to kill you? Well there was that one slap to the leg. I thought you'd say something funny, but you just screamed. Just like the others. Aw, you're not gonna cry now, are you? You killed Dee, she was the only person who was ever really nice to me. Boo-hoo. You hurt me enough already, why can't you just leave me alone? I don't think I can, you're too much fun. You really don't have any idea how funny you are, do you? You wanna see something funny? You know I do. I never would have guessed that you would put up the best fight. Kat please, don't kill me please. I'm sorry, Baby. Sleep well, Princess. Donna! We've got to find a way out of here. The windows open, there's a ladder. We can all get out. What, Samantha? He's one of the killers. Kat had help, he helped her. He was with me when Kat got away. Oh yeah, I guess that leaves me. Are you crazy? Actually, I think I am. Kat's my sister, older by a year. Same mother, different father. Our mother was a whore, she killed your mother. Committed suicide. Kat and I have a theory, insanity runs in the family. Anyway, if it wasn't them, following Tiffany around for four years sure as hell drove me insane. I can help you, Samantha. You and Kat, we can all just walk out of here together and find a way to make you better. Right. Sweet, innocent little Alice. Always looking for a way to be good, do the right thing. Did it ever occur to you that we don't want your help? Stay still, will ya? No, I'm not going to let you get me. Right, just like how your mother stopped our mother? All she stopped was an axe. Alice, Alice! Stop, stop! Her mother killed my mother! She and Kat killed so many of my friends! Dear, it's horrible. I know. You can have a good cry about it tomorrow, we both can. But I need you to be strong right now. Kat is still somewhere in the house. Hello, Alice? Guess again, roomie! Ok, Kat, can you help me? I'm stuck in the window. This is quite the predicament you got yourself into. Let's preserve the moment. Ok, see if you can guess what I have in my hand. Get me out. Get me out is the incorrect answer. OW. Come on, Kat. Don't do this, we're sorority sisters. Ok, try again, but the penalty for being wrong becomes much more severe. Ok, the machete. You have the machete in your hands. Wrong again, I just set it down. OWWWWW! Come on, Mal, think. I want to preserve the moment. The camera, you have my camera in your hand. Very good. What are you doing? Come on, Kat, don't let me die. Don't let them find me like this. Come on. Don't you even want to know why I did it? How I did it? Who I killed? I bet you didn't even know that I killed Charlene Glass and took her keys. Ok, I wanna know. But I wanna know face to face, okay? No, I don't believe you Mallory. You don't care. You know, my opinion for what it's worth, you're pretty superficial. You know if I cut your hip, right there, it'll hurt, and you'll bleed out. Eventually. A slow, painful, humiliating death. Come on, Kat, don't let me die like this. Oh, how about you beg a little more Mal? Come on Mal, please! Ok, you know what, I do wanna die. Why don't you just kill me so you can put me out of my misery. Because I am sick and tired of hearing you talk. Okay? Remember this, Alice. Once you killed somebody, you are a killer. And once you become a killer, you are a killer until your last breath. Just like me, Alice. You're insane. So, what are you gonna do with that dress now, Alice? I am going to burn it. That seems a little extreme. Hey, I cut my rabbit costume into a thousand little pieces. I thought Kat did that for you. Alice, now that you've been through the looking glass you have a sick sense of humor. Is that sick as in good? No, just sick. Alice, honey, what's wrong? We lost a lot of friends. I just can't stop thinking about what Kat said. You know what, don't even think about what Kat said because you know she was out of her mind. What is it? What did she say Alice? She said once I killed, I'd be a killer until my last breath. And here's the really good part, she said that just like her, I'm insane.
