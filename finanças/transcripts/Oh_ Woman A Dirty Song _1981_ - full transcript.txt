Why are you no longer with your wife? She wanted a kid. I also want a child with you. Do not forget that I am a woman .. Our marriage is long over. So when do you marry me? Why you do not know I take care of you... My manager told me that if a man really loved a girl... He would not let her work in a bathhouse. As soon as you have a passing opportunity, you let me down. But that's not true. "Then it is true?" - If it was the case? I would tell it to magazines with scandals. Why are you kicking me? I'm fed up! I'm losing my best years! I could have been a normal girl, Now I'm exhausted! Would you rather have a quiet life with a normal guy? Staying with me will destroy you even more. You will be happier if you leave me. My apologies. Without disturbing you... when is your next concert? - I'd like a coca. - I'm not a bar waitress! What am I supposed to do here? It is true that she needs little company. - So... you want me to pull myself? "Bring the affairs of your wife." If the skull radio graph is normal, it should come out in the next few days. - He's not my wife. - It's true? So you have to be still in shock. I am in shock... but I will bring his things. You impress me! Want to be impressed? She has a problem ...? I'm in my period... It's dangerous... if you enjoy indoors. I'm fine, but... She is at the hospital. Yeah... I understand... I'm coming... Thanks. Hello! Do not be wild. You're scaring me. What are these stuff? For the next disc promotion campaign. I'm gonna have to go to the record stores... As a vulgar folk singer? Your fears are well founded! This is your program! This can raise the audience for your last song. Good... I've been rock in 'for a long time... I'm not a kid anymore. I'm not going to beg people to buy the record. How much do you think we can sell? Tell me! If you think I like it, But we have no choice. If we can not sell records, it's over. And for you... Same! Excuse us... can you use your toilet? Jyoji come and change you! - No need. - Okay. - Where are the electrical connections? - Over there. - Good. - I have to hand in his poster? - Yes thanks! Can you put it in the window, please? Test... Test back... Jyoji... it's ready! The new single from Jyoji Takagawa! You can get it right now! An autograph, please. - Your name? - Izumi, Yuka. - You know the box "Story of a night"? - No. No? They make free entry for women. - You should go with your girlfriends? - Okay. Thank you very much! Stop this song shit! Chant rather "Yosaku"! Come on... We're going... I do not want you to think I'm a bitch. Take that off. I do not fuck at the first appointment. Do you prefer me to stop? I undress. The patient recovered. She has already left the hospital. For you. You're petty. I know you bought them for her. I am pregnant. Is this a joke? Off course. Ms Suzuki... I want to be your boyfriend, but without commitment. {0}6.{/0} {1} {/1} {0}6.{/0} {1} {/1} I have already forgotten! Sorry... you can write it to me? And we're all done! I have not worked for a few days... so I feel clean inside. - Make love. - Mmmm, I'm sleeping... I do not want you to know my body... Please... Let's make love... Continue like this... Why is he late? Why do you allow him to hang around so late? Stop this thing! I'm worse than fed up with you! Bringing money once a month does not make you a husband. Bringing toys or cakes to birthdays does not turn you into a father... 11800:26: 12,170 -> 00:26:19,802 I'm sick of this life. I do not live anymore. Almost dead. But, dear... Do not touch me! I took my decision. I ask for a divorce. - You are serious? - I'm. What are you going to do with Yusuke? Do not worry. I'm not asking you to take care of it. I will raise him alone... as I have always done. Did you find someone else? I am looking for one... able to accompany me to the meetings parents-professors. Yusuke will soon return to college. - I do not want to get divorced! - Let go of me! I do not want to grow old just waiting for you! Leave me... Go! Pars! No! Go away! No! No! Good evening mother! Mom, Yutaka bought me roller skates. Ah, are you here? Yutaka... You're too nice. Yusuke, thank you? I begin to understand. Do not think anything. Yutaka is not like you. Are you kidding me? Would not you be able to lie quietly? Can you repeat that? Shut up! Make us peace. We hear even more music. - There's a lot of people tonight. - What is this song? - I do not know... - I've heard this before. A new singer? Not important. Wait... Looks like an Elvis song... Elvis Presley was a god of song. Compared to him... it's just shit. - You have a problem? - What are you doing? You can make less noise? We do not care about this song! You want to fight? You want us to go outside, huh? - Standing! - You gave him his account... Miss Suzuki... you can take an emergency patient? I do not have any hardware here. But are you a nurse? I have no medicine! I only have one bed. - Dis... - Ouch! - Dis... Oh! Hello. He's there? He was not with you last night? Huh? I went to set up contracts with nightclubs. It has a planned concert. Thank you for warning. I count on him. Excuse me... Do not stop... I'm near to enjoy... Hello? Hello? Continue. Stop! No! What's wrong? You forgot something? - He was here? Do not tell me the opposite. - He just left. - How long has it been? - Since you came to the hospital. - It's filthy! What are you doing for him? You're not even his wife! - And you... what are you then? - The same thing as you! No, it's different. He lives with me. So it's the same. He was also here. You're just her last sex toque! It does not matter! The fact is he was here with me! I'm going to kill you! What did you do to him in Jyoji? I made him a miso soup! A miso soup, that's all? When he can not live without me?! I buy her panties, her cigarettes... everything! You can not make love with him without buying him things? You do not know what I'm doing for him. .I sell my body! If he asked you to work in baths... would you? So, it's a mac? How awful! Debt Recognition for 100,000 yen. He promotes his new song. But yes, we're going to get married. It's planned, mother! Where did you go?! He wants to have a child with me... I'm not ready... but he wants me to eat small fish... To have a healthy girl. Huh? Yoshie... Do not you? Hello? Hello? You're not at work? You're horrible! How long have you been sleeping with this nurse? I have nothing to say. Do something! Anything, excuse you! I smell its smell! I want you to make me a child... Now... right now. The other day... you're totally misguided. I do not care what you think... But it's not just for your wife. How many times? You drive Me crazy! Are you planning to marry a woman who has a child? And you disturbing you? You do not care? - Let's go. - Yeah. Hello everyone. Well... Mark the 2nd and 4th time... I need power in chords... He has returned... He came back for me. - He's here now? - No. - So you just call to hurt me? Not at all... I wanted to talk a little. Did you smell my perfume on him? I only felt its smell. I want to talk to him. Give him the phone. No. Divide between the musicians... There is not much. I would do it for the better. Good morning. What are you doing here? He told me that the textures of our skins were very different... You, it's a rubber bullet Me, silk. Small liar. Where is he? - He has someone else? "Perhaps at his wife's?" We are only two more. Decidedly, he is insatiable and we can do nothing about it. What do you feel when you think he's with someone else? I do not like this, of course, but, you have to do well with. And why? Because it does not bother to kiss me on the floor while you're bedridden to the side. - You wanted it too. - But no... he raped me. You did not want to? You make me shit! I was not looking for sex. "You deserve to be a concubine in a vase." - Explain to me?! After having been dismembered by the Empress! Good evening. Cats. I allowed him to stay here... But you are mine. Its good? Is not it? @3 = ~He's mine! It looks really good! - Come on. - So it's good? So it's good? So it's good? Yes! Its good! Go away!! Stop it! Good news! The audience liked your performance... You're first! The performance on stage... but not the music? I am teasing you. Your song has just entered the Top 30. - You are not funny. - You do not believe me? - You know how many songs I made. - I know it. Was there a single success among them? Huh? Ouch! Ow! You are heavy... Ow! Look! Sit down. Hello? Radio Television Tokyo? I would like to know the current ranking of "One Night Lullaby". Please thank you! - You hear? - 29th. Do you believe me? {48942}{48978}You're hurting me. Hello! - Hello! I brought a gift. - Thank you. We're busy now. We'll discuss it later. I'll come back after the concert. She's one of your fans... I'll introduce her to you afterwards. Superb... Jim Morrison would be blue with envy. Say .. You've gone far! Manager, I have to talk to you. I'll be right back. Great concert! - How was I? - Wonderful! What are you doing? No! I come to see Yutaka... Yutaka! Help! Oh... what's going on here? Why did you do that? She is my girlfriend! You thought there was something between your wife and me... So I wanted to introduce you to my girlfriend. You're a good bastard! I did not know... You did it because she's my girlfriend. You think we're leaving now. If you think about it then break my mouth! No... I will not hit you. You're connected! If you said "no", nothing would have happened. You let yourself go! Do not tell me you were raped... A girl can struggle. Huh? Kazumi... It's your idol... I hope you shouted "help!" While you kicked him. I hope this story will stop him from turning around the girls. - You're too naive. - You think? His career is over. All this work for nothing... When he had just entered the Top 30. What will become of him? He will only be my pimp. "You only think of yourself!" "And yet it is the truth." If he can no longer be a singer, he is no more than a disgusting old man! That suits me. I would like to open a small bar with him. We would work together behind the counter. He would make music from time to time. You see the world only through you! I am honest with myself. And you, what do you think? He kissed everything with a skirt. You deserve me to drown you! Oh, Kazumi! Why did you file a rape complaint? You destroyed his career. I'm his manager. What do I have to do? You are my girlfriend... Please, withdraw your complaint. You said I did not really fight... I want you to know it was rape. Go tell the police that you tried to seduce him, because you were his groupie. But he was cold. And after making love, you were angry. Please, Kazumi... Withdraw your complaint. Pity! He or me? Who is the most important in your life? You count a lot... But, I like it too... In between. I asked for the divorce. Since when I accepted?! If you want to challenge the court, you can do it. You're just a bitch! You feel irreproachable? What are you going to do for Yusuke? Your birthday cake did not have enough candles! He was six years old and you did not know! Please be nice to Yutaka. If Yutaka drops you, you're done. It's not your business! Go to hell! Bye. It looks like a rotten fruit... Even if you marry her, your life will remain miserable. If I were you, I would look for someone else to start a family. And I would leave Jyoji. It's way too late now. If I were you, I would do it anyway... However, I will not withdraw from this situation. Besides, I am curious to know what will happen to him. Either we can also enjoy it... Either we will be the ones that will stay on the tile. You are severe, but you still wish to be with him. I only have him. I'm no longer young like you. I do not know why we pinch both for this guy... It's nothing but a big con... - Say? You want to take a bath together? - Both? "I do not like bathing in the nurses' dormitory. - Why? Because I do not have much hair on my pussy. - Guys like that... - I'm embarrassed to show my slit! - Mine is too bushy. It's embarrassing too. - But why? - That irritates their skin. - Not possible?! I burn the hair with a stick of incense... one by one. You want me to wash your back? - Say? - What? "Will not you get angry?" - Okay. What do girls do in a bathhouse? There is a "foam dance"?! - You want me to show you? - For real? I wish I could! So lie down... You tickle! This tickles too much! Relax! Turn around. He is free. Kazumi, I apologize. You saved my dignity. Jyoji, my excuses will not change anything in the past, but I'm sorry. The rockers who do not sing anymore fall into oblivion... Then I'll help you back up. This will take at least a year or two. You will have a hard time recovering it. It does not matter! It's just a girl! - Do not make your hard. - I'm one! Go for it! Go! Do not stop! Continue. Debt Recognition... You are pregnant? You're young... It's easy for you to be pregnant. I hate you! Sir, I can not make you enjoy it. You must be sick. What? Go ahead. - Have you ever enjoyed before? - Go ahead! A guy unable to fertilize a woman is not a man! But do it! Get out! I do not want your money! - Do it! - No! I can not anymore! Yoshie is deceased. She's gone. She is dead... The baths called... They say a customer killed her. Poor Yoshie, she died without knowing for my abortion. - I choose you. - Thank you. This way... If you allow... If you allow...
