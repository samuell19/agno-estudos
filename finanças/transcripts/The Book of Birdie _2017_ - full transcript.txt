I do hope you'll like it here... and really start to think of this as your home now. It's a simple life but a wholesome one... and in time... perhaps you'll start to think of us as your family. I appreciate your taking Birdie on, I simply... Of course. We'll safe guard the child until she's of age... or should she choose to take the veil. Have you ever felt called to the spiritual life Birdie? Yes ma'am? Have you ever felt called to the spiritual life? The chapel is through here. Prayers in the morning at dawn, then six, then breakfast and the refectory is across from the library there. This is your room. Keep it neat. If you wish, you may join us for vesper shortly. But for tonight, if you prefer you may rest and reflect. I do hope... you will find comfort here in your life. Birdie. Birdie. We missed you at dinner. Everyone was so looking forward to meeting you. A fresh new face. I don't think I should be here. No. The first night can be hard. You'll soon find your special gift. Now, you eat something. Thank you. So, Birdie, how do you like it here? I noticed you're not familiar with our morning prayers. Where did you receive your education? You're quite the Chatty Cathy. - Enough! Sister Clarence? Did you sleep at all last night, Birdie? Do you suppose she's a mute? I think we would all do well to reflect on compassion... and leniency towards Birdie... as she starts her new life with us here. It's important to make a plan for your career. It's so much harder to achieve recognition now... than it use to be, to bring grace and honor to your order. When I take my vows, I wanna go to Africa and help sick babies. What do you wanna do? Oh, it's all right. You have plenty of time to decide. I mean, you aren't even a novice yet. But I do recommend considering international work. There's far more acclaim abroad than there is here. There's hardly anything for us to do here any more. Teaching, feeding the homeless... completely thankless careers if you ask me. These, too? - All of them. Oh, that's Julia. Her father's the groundskeeper here... but he's hurt his back, so she's helping out. It's all right. She grew up here on and off. She isn't one of us, but she respects our way of life. Or maybe respect isn't the right word, but... you have nothing to fear from her. Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God. Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. Ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost it's savior where forth shall it be salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing... but to be cast out... and to be trodden under foot of men. What am I supposed to do? Oh Philomena! Favorite daughter of the Queen of the heavens Your mother delights in your beauty she glories in your graceful virtue and she rejoices for the flowers and offerings made to you by all nations. Oh Philomena! Help us oh generous Virgin and fearless Martyr to meditate the mysteries of the Faith and to remain like you faithful to Jesus Christ until death. Amen. Oh dear, oh dear. God... help. Oh dear. Oh dear. Oh dear. Hi there... little guy. How are you? Ignatius? Blessed. You've been blessed. Ignatius! Birdie, come here. Are you not eating your porridge? I'm sorry, I'm not hungry. Wastefulness is a sin, Birdie. I knew Jesus was the only man for me when I had my first communion. I felt the wafer sizzle in my mouth. I felt him calling to me. Everything I've done since then has been to prepare myself for the spiritual life. I want to be the best. I wanna save unfortunate souls from sin and deprivation. There are some nuns who become quite famous, of course, but... no one's sainted untill after they die. Birdie, your bed was found in quite a state. I must say I'm shocked you're even sleeping on it like this. You must know... the nurses station has all the supplies you need, to manage your... women's curse. Is your bleed always this heavy? Yes, well, until it stopped. But now it's back, I'm very blessed. Well, I'll have to look into buying a mattress pad for you... because we can't afford to be buying mattress every month. Every month? The damage to the mattress must be addressed. I'd like for you to recite 31 Hail Mary's as you work. Hail Mary... Hail Mary... Hail Mary. Hail Mary. You okay? Yeah. So, what happened? Conducting pagan animal sacrifices up there? It was more of a... visitation. I see. I'm Julia. Birdie. It doesn't surprise me, really, from what I've heard about her family. I heard Father Bartholomew... was intervening before with her mother, years ago. That's pretty. This? This is my papa's from the war. It's handy, otherwise I'd be smoking some... sad skanky jags. So... what do you miss the most? - Miss? Yeah, from your old life. I don't know, comic books. Seriously? Now, I'll never know if... Alex manages to merge alternate realities... or if Leah's only interested in the Scarlet Beacon. Alternate realities? - Attacks while defending his science lab from burglars. And the ring? Are you making fun of me? - No, no. I just, I just hadn't pegged you for a hero fanatic. Oh, no, hey, it's okay. Some of those books are just... they are really... boss. So, Julia's nice. - Yeah. She usually keeps to herself. I'm surprised she's so friendly with you. You know you can talk to me about anything. I'm your friend, too. Well, I was wondering. What's the story of the nun in the tree? The what? The... the nun? So, you're the new chickie. Yes. No, not exactly. I see. Are you working toward your novice vows? Don't know. You're a little confused, aren't you, dear? That radiator's not behaving. I'd best scramble, catch you later. - Oh, okay, thanks. Birdie, vespers! So, you got the parcel? - Yes. Thank you, so much. They're wonderful. No, it was nothing, really. I just came across them in town. I know it's dumb. I'm really too old for comics. No, no, it's a... we all have our things, you know. Has anyone seen Birdie? You're the blood sin. He has touched you. Marked you. You've made the devil... let him enter you. I didn't. I didn't let him. He was bigger and stronger. Satan goes where he is welcome. He only gives his special gifts... to the vain and the hungry. It'll be your turn soon to take the veil. You know you must. Blessed be his Holy Name. Blessed be Jesus Christ, true God and true man. Blessed be the name of Jesus. Blessed be his most sacred heart. Blessed be his most precious blood. Blessed be Jesus in the most holy sacrament of the alter. Blessed be the Holy Spirit. Blessed be... Blessed be... Blessed be the great mother of God, Mary most Holy. Blessed be her holy and immaculate conception. Blessed be her glorious assumption. Blessed be the name of Mary, Virgin and Mother. Blessed be St. Joseph, the most chaste spouse. Blessed be... Blessed be, blessed be the Holy Spirit. Amen. Pure Virgin, full of grace then and now... Your whole being was raised Heavenly in full glory... To be elevated above all the hosts within the Kingdom of God. Oh, heavenly Mother... Queen of Heaven and earth... I recognize the glory of your highest title... The Immaculate Heart of Mary! Loving Mother, dispenser of endless blessings... You who continuously intercedes on our behalf... Birdie, dear? Yes Sister? I can't hear your voice when we sing. Sorry, Sister. - Birdie, I'd like you to allow your voice to honor our Lord. We try the Amen? Let's try it again, just the end. Good, a bit louder, Birdie. Beautiful, Birdie. Really good. Thank you, Sister. I'd like to hear more of that, wouldn't you? Yes, sister. I'll try. Glad to hear it. Now, you run along and enjoy your free hour. Thank you. Hello, Chickie. - Hello, Sister. How are you doing then? Good, thanks. I brought some cookies, you want some? Oh, aren't you a dear? I do miss cookies. Sadly, I couldn't possibly swallow a thing. I see. Did you... do that to yourself? I'm afraid so. Why? I mean, sorry. - No, no. It's all right, chick. It was a silly decision... in a fit of emotion. Do you regret it, then? One tries not to have too many regrets. I wasn't particularly suited for the religious life. No. But you... you are touched. - Me? Yes, you. Oh, I knew it the moment you arrived. You're special. Do you hear Him speak to you? Yes. Ever since he arrived that night. He speaks to me and tells me the most wondrous things. I knew it. You are blessed with the holy of visitations. Birdie. Can you see Michigan? Nope. I don't think it really exists. Michigan? I don't think the Dakota's exist. Are these things real just because people tell us they are? Nah. For me, it's not real unless I experience it. Hundreds have suffered. Not just the bleeding and opened wounds... but also ecstatic visions. Were they spiritual before the stigmata... or did the stigmata bring them to the Lord? Well... most documented cases have been Catholics. Though, there are a few who were not. But, surely God is deliberate... with whom he selects for these gifts. Oh, of course, Sister. The great Dr. Embert said: 'The life of stigmatics... is but a long series of sorrows... which arise from the divine malady of stigmata... and ends only in death'. One cannot know God's plan, dear. But we must understand he has one. I'm king. No, I knew this guy. Yeah? - Yeah. Is he cool? - I can't see his face. I prefer it that way. So... will you ever get out of here, you know? Don't know. It feels safe here. Nothing can really get to you. You just have to pray a little. Okay, well... what about the whole wide world out there? Michigan, the Dakotas... North and South. Maybe someday. When I want proof. But right now, I have to see about some other things. I wanna see it all. I... cannot... wait to get out of here. It's like, nothing every happens, and it's... killing me. You better go. You... listened to the devil. Nothing can come to the likes of you. Blessed be God. Blessed be His Holy Name. Blessed be Jesus Christ, true God and true Man. Blessed be the Name of Jesus. Blessed be His Most Sacred Heart. Blessed be His Most Precious Blood. Blessed be Jesus in the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar. Blessed be the Holy Spirit. Blessed be the great Mother of God, Mary most Holy. Mother of God, blessed be. Blessed be. Oh my. These were found in your room. Is that bad? The church does not condone this type of literature. I'm sorry, I didn't know. May I keep them? - No. No... you cannot. Now, Birdie, I need you to try very hard. In future... I want you not to keep this kind of thing from me. This order is based on honesty and devotion. You understand? - Yes, Mother. But I think you've got more voice in there. Try breathing deeper into here. Birdie, honey? What is it? Funny tummy, I think. Beautiful, Birdie. And no more vandalism. Do you hear? I feel like it was 'cause she couldn't say a word. Angelic, it was. Angelic. Sisters, the Bishop has requested... that the finger bone of St. Lucretia... be sent to it's new home in Milwaukee. The convent will officially close in six weeks' time. Mother, if there were something truly special about our order... would they allow us to stay here and continue? It's possible, but... nothing of a relevant caliber comes to mind. Mother. Sister, this is a very serious claim. Now, I know you're a very ambitious young woman... but these are matters not to be played with. Not me. Not me. Birdie. What on earth makes you say something like that? Mother... I've seen things I can't explain any other way. Julia? Hey. Shouldn't you be praying for the sun to rise? No, that's only on Tuesdays. Right. I love you. My... Birdie, my scholarship came through. I have to go today. Look, this is, this is happening really fast. My semester starts next week. See, with a scholarship, this is a chance for me to get out. Like, you know this. Clair, I'm so sorry. Please understand. That's great for you. I have to go. Birdie, wait, wait, wait. Mother of silence... who watches over the mystery of God. Save us from the idolatry of the present time... to which those who forget are condemned. Purify the eyes of pastors with the eye-wash of memory. Take us back to the freshness of the origins... for a prayerful, penitent church. Mother of the beauty that blossoms... from the faithfulness to daily work. Lift us from the torpor of laziness... pettiness, and defeatism. Clothe pastors in the compassion that unifies... that makes whole. Let us discover the joy of a humble... brotherly, serving Church. Mother of tenderness... who envelops us in patience and mercy. Help us burn away the sadness. I am so glad you were able to come. Poor child, she's not well. What do you mean, she's not well? I brought her here thinking everything was going to be fine. You were gonna protect her. - We are protecting. You wouldn't continue to protect her, no one said otherwise. What's happened? Reverend Mother tells me you've had some bleeding. I supposed that's a relief. But you look quite ill. Have you seen a doctor? I wanted to do the right thing for you. Couldn't bear the thought of you going away with your mother. I couldn't protect her. When her need came back, I knew I couldn't protect you either. I'm told there's a place reserved for you... at a very good school for girls in Chicago. Can't I go home with you, Gran? No, my dove. You're safer with the Lord. Now. Let the good sisters help you... to heal. And, you're still certain? Yes. I think she understands, but... I suppose she ought to see a doctor. And did you tell her about her friend? No, I... couldn't bear to upset her further. Can you tell her when she's stronger? Let her pray. She will find peace and comfort from the Lord. Birdie. Birdie. Mary? My sweet girl. Birdie. You're good enough.
