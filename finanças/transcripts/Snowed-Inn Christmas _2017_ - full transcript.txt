RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM Kevin Jenner, travel writer extraordinaire. Doofus. Do you seriously answer your phone like that? Meg, is that you? Yes, it's me. Can't you just add me to your contacts so you don't have to ask every time I call? I don't add anyone to my contacts, it makes answering my phone more thrilling. Hey, I got an important day at work today. Can we, can we talk later? No, I have to talk to you. Do you love me? Do I love you? Yes, I love you. You're my favourite sister. I'm your only sister. Hey, Meg, what's up? Do you need a kidney or something? What? No. I want you to come home for Christmas. Kevin? Did you hear what I just said? Yes. You know I can't do that. I'm going to Aspen on a luxury Christmas piece. It's a big one. I thought your boss hadn't assigned who was going yet. She's choosing me. If I ever get to work. She's picking today. But you haven't been home for Christmas since... Mom misses you. Are you sure everything's okay? Meg, work has been hectic. All right? I'll be there next year, I promise. I'll see you in the new year. I love you. Tell Mom I say hi. Good morning, writers. Good morning. How's everybody doing? Good morning. Nice to you see you. You all look very dapper and beautiful. I like the red, very holiday. All right. As you all see we are in mid-December and our holiday content is in full swing. Epiphany has never looked more festive. Look at it. I am very proud of the hard work that each and every one of you has put in this last year. You've done a great job. Thank you. However, Epiphany's traffic has gone down about 20% since last December. Yeah. I mean, it's like competition in the online magazine world is fierce, I could hardly keep up. Let me guess. Another pregnant woman needed saving on the way to work this morning? No, no, no. It was... Litter of kittens. Very sad. As I was saying, Epiphany's readership has taken a turn. People, they don't want any more of that New Age hipster holiday fluff. They want stories of hope, they want stories of redemption, they need the proof that the Christmas magic still exists out there somewhere. So it's really important, really important, for each and every one of us to start finding stories that speak to the heart of the season. And I hate to have to say this but our jobs depend on it. How do our jobs depend on it? Are you saying there's going to be cuts? Likely in the new year. Unless we all get a Christmas miracle. And I hate to have to break this on you guys right before the holiday but unfortunately that's just the way it is. So, any other questions? Have you decided who's getting the Christmas Aspen piece? Yes, it's going to be you. You're picking him? Yeah. And you too. Sorry? Excuse me? What do... Wait. What do you mean that we're both going? We have two completely different writing styles. Yeah, that's right. One is interesting and fun. It's clean and professional versus messy and disorganized. One is boring and bland. Boring and bland? Really? I've been here... Come on. Will both of you please stop it? Stop it! I said stop before I... Or do I need to send both of you to detention? I mean, these are tough times in journalism. Our readers, they need to be part of a story that puts them in the Christmas spirit so they can remember what Christmas is truly about. Which is what exactly again? You know, that is for you two to figure out. All I know is that our readers should be so enchanted that they are rushing to plan their own Aspen Christmas. And that is why I picked both of you, my two best writers. Because you two are wonderful but you're skilled in different ways. And I know this may sound a little harsh but I really need to figure out which one of you is my most valuable writer. No, really. Do my readers want soft and warm and historic? Or do they want fast and bold and straight to the point? Why are those mutually exclusive? I don't understand. Well, it's simple. It's simple. Whichever one of you can write the piece that gets the most traffic to the site, then you are my most valuable writer. And what happens to the person that doesn't get the most traffic? Like I said, we all need a Christmas miracle. Flight leaves 1:00 pm sharp. Please don't be late. I don't care how many kittens need saving, Mr. Jenner. Yes, ma'am. Miss Hudson, I need to speak with you. Enchanting is my niche. Why am I being sent to Aspen with the class clown? Will you please stop it? Please. I need to protect this company. Now, how are you doing? I know this is a hard time of year for you. I'm fine. No. Really. I need to know, Jenna. It's only been, what, a month since you and Andrew broke up? And I know how excited you were to meet him and his family for the holidays. Oh, no. Everything's great. I'm happy. I just want to work. You know what I think? I think that it would be good for you to meet someone new. No, really. Be open to new experiences. And you never know, you might meet somebody in Colorado. Oh, boy. I'm going to go now. Let that hair down a little bit, girl. No, really. Loosen up. Can't write with my hair down. It's itchy. I meant that figuratively and you know that. I know. Loosen up! Goodness. What was that about? We're stuck sharing the article. Well, I'll be on the slopes most of the time anyway. Do you board? Do I look like I board? That's right. Robots don't board. Look, Aspen is a big place. We'll just stay out of each other's way. Fine by me. Me too. Where you going? To organize. And pack. We don't leave 'til tomorrow. Ha. Toothbrush, phone, passport, floss. Taxi. - Hi? - Hey. Sorry for dropping in on you like this. What's up? You going somewhere? Aspen for work. You got the Aspen gig. Good for you. I knew you would. When's your flight? One o'clock. My taxi really should be here any minute. Flight's not for another four hours. Andrew, if you want to talk about things I could probably... I think I left my lucky tie here and I just wanted to grab it before the office Christmas party. It's in the second drawer. Great. Yeah! You ironed it too! You're the best. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Welcome to flight 1215 departing shortly for Aspen, Colorado. We anticipate a bit of a bumpy ride this afternoon. Blizzards are making their way across the Midwest. So, please don't be alarmed by any turbulence along the way. We hope you have a comfortable flight. Thank you. Of course she put our seats together. Excuse me. Sorry about that. This plane's taking off in four minutes. Did you seriously just get here? I ran into a cute girl at the souvenir shop. Unbelievable. She wanted a piece of my chocolate bar. Trust me, it takes really charm for me to share my chocolate. Yeah. Did you get her number? Tell her you were going to Aspen? "Hey, I'm going to Aspen." You think you got me all figured out, huh? You are so not that complicated. Thanks for sharing your chocolate with me, Mister. Anytime. Have a good flight. So cute. What's that noise? What is that sound? Are you afraid of flying? What? No. I fly all the time. Me. This is going to be good. This is a special news weather update. Low pressure systems and a sudden onset of blizzard-like conditions are making their way across the Midwest. Oh, yeah. Too fast. I'm too fast. That is so loud. What is that hunk of junk? Electronic Quarterback, totally addicting. You know there's, like, 1,000 apps you can download instead of lugging that thing around. I got this thing for Christmas when I was five years old from my dad. All right? I held the top score since I was 12 years old. The top score? The top score. On your own game? That's impressive. Trust me. You do not want me as a competitor. Is that so? Yeah. In anything. You care to prove me wrong? No, I'm fine. Thank you. Oh, no. No, please. Be my guest. Nope. I'm good. Thanks. Be my guest. I'd love for you to play it. No, I really don't want to irritate on this place with all the crazy noises that thing makes. You're afraid of a 12-year-old's score, is that what it is? No, I'm fine. I'm good. Yeah? I can understand there's five buttons on this thing so I get it, you know. You don't know how to play. All right. How do you play this? All right. Do you know what foot... ball is? Yes, I know what football is. So there's three offensive players and six defensive computer controlled players. Okay. You press the blue button to run. You press the red button to pass. Okay. There we go. Just like that over and over again? Okay, just... Yeah, don't press the buttons so hard. There I go. Look. I did it again. It gets more difficult. As you get to the fourth level. Did it again. Let's see. Here we go. I see that you're doing it. All right? Okay. I feel like I'm winning. I feel like I'm just winning one right after another. You're doing okay. I mean, there's still... It's great. Look how close I'm getting to your score. Touchdown! Hey. Sorry. You're making a scene. It's just turbulence. It's going to be all right. This is your captain speaking. Due to inclement weather conditions in Colorado the Aspen County Airport is now closed. What? What? We're preparing for an early landing. I assure you there is nothing to worry about. Simply a precautionary measure. I apologize for any inconvenience. Emergency landing? It's supposed to come out of the ceiling. I can't breathe. It's not... it's not an emergency. Relax, okay? I can't breathe. Don't laugh at me. I can't breathe. We're going to land and then we'll take the first flight out to Aspen. All right. It's not a big deal! Oh, god. You don't know that. Yes, I do know that. Trust me. We will begin our descent to a local airport just outside of Santa Claus, Indiana immediately. Did he just say Indiana? Did he just say Santa Claus? Can I have a... May I help you? Yes. Yeah, we need the first flight out to Aspen, please. I'm sorry, all flights are cancelled right now. We have no clear idea when we'll be able to fly anyone out. Listen, we're actually not on vacation like everybody else. We have to get to Aspen because our jobs depend on it. I'm sure you can understand. We can't stay in Indiana. Well then, you better start wishing for a Christmas miracle. Smooth. No, I understand. Thank you. No vacancy there either. One more person tells me to wish for a Christmas miracle I'm going to lose it. This is unbelievable. We're not going to get to Aspen, we're going to lose our jobs. I'm not losing anything. Let me tell you. That lady was right. We need a Christmas miracle. There's no such thing as miracles! It's nice to be positive during the holidays. There's no such thing! Okay? Well. I haven't seen such big frowns since the Christmas with no snow. Here. Thanks. So, what seems to be the problem here? You don't have to worry about it. Our plane was grounded and we don't have anywhere to go or stay. But, you know, we'll figure it out. Well, that's quite a frosty pickle. That's one way of putting it. Do you happen to know of any hotels in the area that would have vacancy this close to Christmas? Funny you should ask, my husband and I own a small inn in town. If you need a place to sleep and a warm meal, I assure you we are the coziest place around. That just sounds... miraculous. There's Chris now. What have we here, my petal? These kids need a place to stay for the night. And I don't think I know your names. How rude of me. I'm sorry. I'm Jenna Hudson, I'm a writer from New York. Well, I'm not from New York but I went to NYU for journalism... She asked for your name. Not your resume. Columbia. Hi, guys. I'm Kevin. Hi, Kevin. Well, I'm Carol Winters and this my husband Chris. Wonderful to meet you both. We'd be delighted to have you stay with us. Absolutely. No excuses. We should be going though, it's going to be dark soon. I'll go fetch Rudolph. Like the reindeer? Don't be silly. It's what we call our car. Welcome to the Winters Inn. How old is this place? It's been standing tall since 1832. Look at the detail in that mahogany. That stained glass window. My goodness, this could be the work of Louis David. Who? I've always admired Georgian homes, you know, they're so symmetrical and balanced. Well, somebody knows their architecture. You're such a suck up. I have a subscription to Architecture Digest, sue me. You kids must be tired, we'll get your room ready. Lucky for you, the Mistletoe Suite is available for tonight. What? Oh, no, no, no. No, we can't. We're not together. I would never ever. Oh, my god. Well then, why are you travelling together for the holidays? We're on assignment. We're both writers for Epiphany Magazine. Yeah, I'm supposed to be in Aspen right now in a luxury chalet writing a heartfelt Christmas piece. I'm supposed to be boarding knee deep in powder at a legendary mountain. And then I was going to have a holiday cooking cuisine class with a triple Michelin-star chef, which is very exciting. There's a natural spa actually. I don't think there's any natural spas in Aspen. Appointment at the springs. My mistake. I'll put you in separate rooms. They'll have to be side by side though. Can you two manage that? Oh, yes. Yeah, yeah. That's perfect. Thank you. Oh, hi. Will this do? Carol, thank you. It's perfect. There are complimentary pajamas in the drawer if needed. And the bell will ring at 8:00 in the morning for breakfast downstairs. Well, great. I think I'll be up and about well before 8:00. Very well. I'll see you then. Knock knock. You know, you could actually knock like a normal person. What? You laugh now, huh? It's like I'm in a bed full of bunnies. Wait 'til you try yours on. It's like I'm wearing nothing. But I'm not. You really have a way of putting things so even a two-year-old can understand. I have my own pajamas, thank you. Not a lot of light in here, huh? I like it. My bed's softer than yours. Is there something you needed? No, I just wanted to know if you wanted some help unpacking your broom and cape. Goodnight, Kevin. Goodnight, Jenna. Well, well, look who came late to breakfast. Yes, I slept in. Haven't slept in since I was a child. Sounds like the saddest thing I've heard in my entire life. Have you looked outside yet? Looks like we're living in an Indiana snow globe. Yeah. With no way out. Yes, that's what a snow globe is, you're stuck inside. What is your issue with Indiana anyway? Maybe that it's not a luxury chalet in Aspen surrounded by beautiful snowcap mountains? Thank you, Carol. We might not be Aspen but there's no place like the Winters Inn. You'll see. Well, you're lucky to be here for our last Christmas before we close. You're closing? Why? Oh, dear. The developers have been threatening to shut us down for years to build a big luxury hotel. You're still here. Sure. Since this place has been designated as an historic site it can never get approval. What happened? They made a case that the man who founded this inn in 1832 is a fictional character. And therefore the building has no historical significance. Who founded it? Well, the great Saint Nick, of course. I'm... so sorry to hear that's happening to you. Is there anything that can save your inn? Only if we can prove that it is a national historic landmark. Good morning, my dear. Good morning, you two. Morning. Morning, Chris. Any word on those flights? Looks like the snow is disappearing and we really... We should get started, we should go. The blizzard is still in full effect in Colorado. There are no flights in or out of Aspen. You got to be kidding. What? On the bright side, all this fresh show is perfect for our sleigh rides this afternoon. That's very sweet. So, you're saying there's no way into Colorado? I can't drive there. There must be another way to Aspen. A private airport. There's a lot of rich people in Aspen. It's a great idea. What, are you going to charter your own jet? Did I say I was going to charter a jet? It sounded like you meant that, yeah. Why don't you and your pancakes mind your own business? Okay, fine. Yeah. We'll just sit over here and enjoy our carbs. Okay, okay, okay. I'm sorry, you two, it looks like you're snowed in. You're snowed in?! Yeah, there's no way in or out. This is a disaster. I need your pieces uploaded the site by 9:00 am on Christmas Day. What am I supposed to publish now? I know. And where did you guys say you were again? Indiana. It's Santa Claus, Indiana to be specific, and there's a lovely couple who's let us stay at their beautiful historic inn. It's decorated like Santa's Village in here. Because it's Christmas time. I mean, what is wrong with you? Would you look at this place? Okay, wait a second. Did you just tell me that your plane landed in a town called Santa Claus one week before Christmas? Yeah. Why do you make this sound like it's a good thing? Because it is a good thing! You guys, you need to stay! There's a story there, I can feel it. Simone, okay. I have spent weeks organizing my research. Will you please be quiet, both of you, and figure it out? Or find another job. Now, I thought I'd taught you that the heart of being a good journalist is finding the extraordinary in the ordinary. So, find it! Wait! Simone! Simone! Guys, guys? Merry Christmas. Wait! All right? Bye. Oh, gosh. They get on my nerves. Don't you just love decorating the Christmas tree? Yes. It brings people together in such a special way. How about you, Kevin? Did your family decorate the Christmas tree together when you were a kid? My dad would take us Christmas camping. Christmas camping outside? No, no, no, no, we... we'd camp out in the living room in front of the Christmas tree after we decorated. We'd, just keep the tree lights on and eat Christmas caramel popcorn and my dad would read us Christmas stories until we fell asleep. Kevin, that sounds beautiful. You dad sounds amazing. Yeah. He's the best. How about you, Jenna? Yeah, yeah. We had plenty of great Christmas traditions. My mom used to make this peppermint hot chocolate that all the neighbourhood kids went crazy for. And we made homemade marshmallows. And, on Christmas eve my parents would set our stockings at the end of the bed, and then early in the morning we would wake up and have, you know, something to open before... everybody else. You okay over there, Jenna, you look a little frazzled? Nothing, I'm fine. Thank you. Don't tell me you're reading about this place when you could be outside experiencing it. Yes, I think it's important to know the history. What did you find outside? I found a great coffee spot. They roast their beans in house. Came across a couple local kids tobogganing. Took their saucer down a hill, it was electrifying. Sounds terrifying. You never tobogganed as a kid? No, never. So, what are you, what did you find in your book? I'm not going to tell you. Go do your own research. What do you think this is, huh? I think that's coffee. Show me your research. Let's see it. It's all up here. I can't believe you're my competition. Come on, no, no. Tell me. Tell me one fact you learned in your book. No. Pretty please. Okay. The legend is two centuries ago old Saint Nick crashed his sleigh here one Christmas Eve after delivering Christmas presents but he liked it so much he decided to stay and make it his home. The North Pole was too conspicuous? Apparently it's tradition now to look up in the sky at midnight on Christmas Eve and see a golden streak. A golden streak? Yes, it's a dash of the Christmas spirit marking the end of Christmas Eve and the beginning of Christmas Day. And, only those who believe will be able to see it. Sounds like you're wasting your time. It's magical, right? You know Santa Claus isn't real, right? Yes! You just asked me what I was reading. Because I wanted facts. I didn't want some ridiculous fairy-tale. Well, I happen to think this is interesting. Forget it. Jeez. All right. Yeah. Hey! Sharing is caring. What, did your father not teach you any manners as a kid? My father taught me everything. Well, he skipped over common decency. You're just upset because you know that I'm going to find a better story here and you're going to start the new year off unemployed. You've got some nerve, pal. Pal? Yes! And you know what else? You're really lucky you don't believe in Santa Claus because you would be getting coal for being this irritating. Irritating? Carol, tell me about living in Santa Claus, Indiana. What's your favourite part about being here during the holidays? Are there any traditions everyone participates in? Certainly our Christmas Eve festival here at the Inn. We all gather here, sing carols, and we dance and we eat the most delicious treats. That sounds fantastic. It's enchanting. I'm going to miss it next year. I'm so sorry they're closing this place down. It would sure take a Christmas miracle to save it now. Carol. That's it. What's what, dear? I'm going to write my article on saving your inn. It's going to be a story of hope and redemption and Christmas spirit and everything Simone wants. You're very sweet, but it'll be hard to find any proof. No, no, no. I'm a journalist. And I'm a good one. Research is what I do. I just wouldn't want you to get your hopes up, Jenna. No. Anything is possible at Christmas! Right. Let's do this. Cheers. Cheers. Good morning. Here they are. Thank you. It's a big one. Merry Christmas. Is all this mail for you, Chris? We're the only town in the world whose post office bears the name Santa Claus, so the town gets thousands of letters every Christmas from kids asking for things. No one else in town knew what to do with all that mail so I volunteered. Here, read one. "Dear Santa, it's me Oscar." Oscar. Heh. "This year I'd really like a megastar scooter in blue. "I promise I'll share it with my brother Coby "even though he never shares his candy with me." Coby. Yeah. Do you... Do you ever respond to any of these? Every single one. Well. I remember once upon a time believing in Santa Claus. What happened? I grew up. Somewhere along the way I stopped celebrating Christmas altogether. That's a real shame. You know, Christmas is meant to be spent with loved ones. Even for those who have lost their Christmas spirit. Yeah, well. I'll do that in the new year. This Christmas is all about keeping my job. If you say so. Hey, what's going on? What, are you following me now? Yeah. That's exactly what I'm doing. So, what do you think the story is here? What's your angle? Like I'm going to tell you. I'm just trying to make conversation. Fine. I was thinking of hidden Christmas getaway the whole family will treasure. Hidden? The town's called Santa Claus. All right. Well, it's a working title. What do you have? I'm not going to tell you. You're ridiculous. I'm going to go meet Santa. Adorable. This is great. Of course he's the town Santa. Are you sure you don't want to visit Santa and tell him what you want for Christmas? How come? He thinks the kids are all going to laugh at him. One second, all right? Hey, buddy. What's going on? He can't hear you. I'm sorry. Thank you so much. You know sign language? A little. My grandfather lost his hearing during the war. My mom grew up always talking sign language to him and she wanted my sister and I to learn so we wouldn't miss out on getting to know our grandpa. Sounds like a great mom. Yeah, she's the best. What did you say to him? I told him I personally knew Santa and I'd let him know what he wanted. What does he want? Video game. I wonder if he'll keep it for 30 years. That was a good one. "In 1935, Congress passed the Historic Land Act "which authorized the US Secretary "to formally and legally record historic properties "as having national historical significance. "With this status "it cannot be torn down under any circumstance. "Search your property "to check for its historical significance." Okay. Winters Inn. Indiana. Okay. "Although there's a rumour "that the Winters Inn in the heart of Santa Claus, Indiana "was once formally granted a legal certificate in 1937 "starting its historic significance, "it has gone missing from the records "and the significance is now unknown. "Myth goes that the sealed document has been hidden somewhere within the old inn for over 50 years." Oh, boy. Please be a good idea. Hello? Hey. I miss you too, sis. What you guys up to? You decorate the tree yet? You are? That's... that's nice. I wish I could be there too. Aspen. It's... It's amazing. The chalet's unbelievable. The boarding conditions are perfect. I know, I'm lucky. I'm very lucky. All right, say hi to Mom. Bye bye. Hey you. I'm here at the Chicago office and I can't stop thinking about you. I can't wait to get home tomorrow. I miss you so much. Man, this heat wave is killing me. Typical for July, I suppose. Anyway, I love you. Yeah. I got to go. Okay? I'll see you tomorrow. Yes. What are you doing up? It's after midnight. Couldn't sleep. I'm hungry. What are you doing awake? I couldn't sleep either. I'm hungry. You want me to make you something? Do the honours. You know, all the finest chefs in the world crack an egg with one hand. Show me. Ooh, sorcery. And what's this? It's the Christmas Eve Festival. Didn't Carol tell you about it? It sounds great. They, sing carols and dance and eat snacks. It sounds fun. Well? What? Go ahead. Aren't you going to make fun of it? I'm going to hang up my Scrooge top hat. Ghost of Christmas Past, Present and Future can haunt somebody else for tonight. And the Grinch's heart grew three sizes that day. Hey. You're not supposed to play with it, you have to make cookies out of it. Okay, all right. All right. Yeah, all right! Does it look like a house? It doesn't look like a house? It depends. Here. Here! - We got a tray. - Hot. Hot. Did you just touch it? What's wrong with you?! Hot. They have to cool down! Hot. Okay, okay. What? Nothing. I just... I've never seen you with your hair down. It looks good. Is that Kevin Jenner sarcasm I'm detecting? No. You know, I'm not always a jerk. Can I ask you something? Yeah, of course. Why'd you want this Aspen assignment so badly? What do you mean? You seem like you have a great family. Why don't you want to spend Christmas with them? It's a big piece, it could really push my career forward. You know that. Is that the only reason? There's that and... Also I try to avoid Christmas at all costs. Thanks. Yeah. How about you? Aren't you missing your family at Christmas? No... To be honest, Christmas was never really much of a big deal. Why? What about... the peppermint hot chocolate and the marshmallows and the stockings? Right. I was put up for adoption when I was a baby and I was never adopted. So, I never did get to spend a real Christmas with a real family. I just usually watched cheesy Christmas movies in whatever agency I was in that year. And I always wanted to wake up on Christmas morning with stocking and a family that really loved me but... You know, being here is the closest I've come to having a real Christmas with a real family. I thought I was going to get one with Andrew's family this year but that didn't pan out. Andrew? Yeah, my ex. We broke up, well he broke up with me. He felt like he couldn't follow through with our five year plan. Five year plan? Yes, I know. I know. It sounds... high maintenance. But it made sense, you know? It seemed like it was a really reasonable thing for us to do. We were right on paper and we should map out our future and take a look, make sure we're on the same page, make sure there's no surprises. Surprise, we broke up. Can you really plan out your future? I thought we could. Everything seemed like it was right on schedule. We were supposed to get engaged in three months. I had a ring picked out. You miss him? Sometimes. Honestly, since we've been here I haven't thought of him too much. It's been kind of refreshing. So... Maybe I just missed the idea of him. I just... I don't think you should have to try so hard to fall in love, I think it should be exciting and impulsive. And unpredictable. That sounds awful. Have you ever been in love? Does Kelly Kapowski count? No. Look, I could jump out of a plane at 12,000 feet. But falling in love, like, really, really falling in love... scares the hell out of me. Finally something we have in common. Well, thank you. I should be, getting to bed. I have a lot of research to do in the morning. Yep. Goodnight. Night. Hey, wait. You want to get some fresh air? It's two o'clock in the morning. So, what else are you afraid of? You mean besides being stuck in Indiana with you? I... I write about what I'm afraid of to get over my fears. Like what? Like, what's the scariest thing you've ever done? By far, swimming with Great White Sharks in New Zealand. Yeah. I remember that article. It was so great. My heart was racing so fast I could hardly finish it. How about your article about saving the Great Barrier Reef? That was amazing. You read one of my articles? Well, yeah, I've read them all. You're an amazing writer. Really? You think so? Why do you think I've been such a baby about being paired up with you as my competition? That's really funny how things turn out. What do you mean? We've worked together in the same office for all these years and only had a real conversation now. I always thought you didn't know who I was. I felt really invisible in that office sometimes. You felt invisible? I noticed you the first day you walked into that office. If anything, I thought you were ignoring me. Well. There's one thing I can say about you, Kevin, it's that you're impossible to ignore. That's true. Do you guys remember ever seeing a certificate from the 1930s? It really would be the golden ticket to saving this inn. It's an historical legal document the developers could not argue against. You have any idea where it could be? Oh, that. Last time I saw that, Theodore Roosevelt was president. I'm on a really tight deadline. I was doing some research and, well, it's a certificate that I need in order to write my piece about saving the inn. It's exactly the kind of story our readers need right now. It would fill them with hope and belief in the magic of the season. It's the perfect Christmas story. Good morning, everyone. Morning. Morning. Hello, good morning. What's on the agenda today, son? You know somewhere we can rent a car? Rent a car? Where are you going? Is this for research? 'Cause you know Simone wants us to stay here and write. You know, actually I was thinking you might want to come with me. Why? It's a secret. Well, I can't. I really need to continue researching and finish writing. We only have three days left. Don't be silly, Jenna. You've lots of time. You can borrow Rudolph. I think it'd be good for you both to go out for the day. Thanks, guys. All right. Okay, we have been driving for 45 minutes. Where are we going? We'll be there soon. Don't worry about it. All right. Well, wherever we are, it's very beautiful here. Yeah. It is. We're going to see my family. Your family? Like your... what kind of family? My immediate family. You grew up in Indi... You grew up in Indiana, we've been hanging out for three days, didn't think once to mention that. You know what? I heard you talking to your sister on the phone and you lied to her, you told her that you were in Aspen. Why did you do that? The walls are thin. What's going on? It's complicated. Don't give me it's complicated. You brought me all the way out here. There was no reason to tell you. What is the deal? My dad passed away three years ago. Suddenly. And I never had the chance to say goodbye. I haven't come back for Christmas since. I'm sorry. So, you haven't seen your family in three years? No, no, no. I see my family all the time. I love them. My niece, Tori, she's the cutest thing you'd ever want to see. It's just... the thought of spending the holidays without him is... Yeah. I get that. And that's why you wanted the Aspen assignment so bad. Hooray, we're here. You ready? Yeah, I think so. Okay. You coming? Yeah. Mom? Megan? Kevin! You're home! How are you? Kevin! I thought you were in Colorado. Hey gang, what's going on? I missed you! Surprise. You're here. I'm here. I'm Wendy. I'm Wendy. And this is Megan. Hi. Jenna. Hi. So good to meet you. Thanks. You too. Uncle Kevin! Hey! That's our Tori. How's my favourite niece? I'm your only niece. That's... that's right. You are. What's all this commotion? What's going, stranger? How's it going, man? It's good to see you, good to see you, great to see you. This is my husband Eric. Hi. Jenna. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Beautiful lady. Congrats, man. Congrats. Oh, no. No, no, no. We just work together at the magazine, we're coworkers. Of course. Okay, of course. All right. Who's hungry? Do you put honey on your mashed potatoes? Honey? That smells amazing. Thanks. It's a two-hour meal, so I would hope so. Can you help me put this on the tree? Yeah. I would love to. I made this one myself. No, you didn't! Oh, my gosh. You're so talented. Guys, she's so adorable. We know, man. We know. Put it there. Are you two writing together? Simone has us on separate pieces. We each have to write something about Christmas magic. It's actually an experiment to see who the readers like more. It's not ideal. So, you two are competitors? It's a cutthroat industry. You know? And we had no choice. So, what angles are you both taking? That's a good question, Mom. Yeah. You should tell them, I'm sure they'd be really interested in hearing what you have to say. I'd really like to know, I think the whole... You've been doing so much research. You guys aren't telling each other what you're writing about, are you? No. Maybe not. Mine's not really coming together anyways, so there's not much to say. How's your coming, Kev? I haven't started yet. Of course you haven't. I never start writing until the last day just in case something more inspiring comes along. Because you're a master of your craft, that's why. Thank you. That's just his way of saying he's a master procrastinator. Procrastinator, you? Never. Mom, artiste. I'm an artiste. Okay? It wasn't an awful Christmas, it was a great Christmas. I got the train set. "To Megan, love..." To Megan? It said, "To Kevin." I gave you the blue and the green ones. Yeah, out of a 10-piece train set. You locked it in your bedroom? That's like 40%. Little weird, huh, Jenna? Is this why you have trains in your office everywhere? Busted! He does. They're lined up right by the window. There's no trains in my office. There are so trains in your office! Trains in your office. Trains? No, there's one train. I'm so happy you came home for Christmas. Thank you. Here I am to be able to tell my half of the story. I'm all ears, man. I'm all ears. I even had it etched on the caboose. What book you got there, sweetheart? The Christmas Miracle. That's a good one. That's a good one. "Once upon a time there was a boy named Charles "who couldn't stand the Christmas season. "On Christmas Eve he would run up to his bedroom "and jump on his bed and put his pillow over his head. "He didn't want to be like the other boys in school "who tried to stay awake all night "just to hear Santa's sleigh bells. "This Christmas Eve he..." Your family's really great, Kevin. You're lucky to have them. I know they loved having you there. I know I did. Me too. Thanks. That was a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. It's almost like my dad was there with us. He would've liked you a lot. Yeah. Look, Jenna, I hope this isn't too forward but I would love it if you came home with me on Christmas Day. That was, really nice. Thank you for inviting me. That was fun. Hey, about the article, I know there's a lot at stake. I just don't want work to get in the way. Get in the way of what? Our friendship. You want us to be friends? Yeah. Yeah, I think you're really nice. Thanks. Thanks. I'm sorry. Was the article the only thing you were thinking about all night? Because not everything has to be a competition, you know? And this is coming from Miss Competition? I'm not... I'm not competitive! I'm organized and I'm assertive! And impossible. 1842? Okay, I got to talk to you. I need to talk to you as well actually. Okay. You go first. Look at that picture. That's Christopher and Carol. Right? I mean, I can't be 100% sure but that's them, right? That's definitely them. It looks just like them. Flip it over. 1842. It can't be right. I know. But look at the paper, look at the clothes they're wearing. The photograph is definitely over 100 years old. There's no way. It's impossible. Unless... Maybe it isn't? What are you trying to say? Maybe Christopher is actually... Santa Claus. Is that so crazy? Yes! Jenna. You're not a kid anymore, okay? You got to stop thinking about Santa Claus and start worrying about your article to save the inn. Okay? How'd you know I was writing about the inn? Well, I... I might've overheard you talking to Christopher and Carol about finding the certificate to prove this place is a historic landmark. You don't think it's a good idea? I didn't say that. I didn't say that! I can see it all over you. All over me? There's nothing on me. I'm just... It's just Christmas Eve is in a couple of days and if you don't find it I don't want you to be crushed. Well, thanks for the vote of confidence. What'd you want to talk to me about? I... It... Oh, god. I want to know if you want to come to the Christmas Festival with me. It's happening in a couple of days. And I'm going to be done my article. And I want to know if you can be the first person to read it. You can maybe give me some spelling corrections. You want me to copy edit the Christmas Eve Festival? That's not what I meant. I want you to be the first person to read my article. Okay. I should be done with mine by then, so. Cool. Maybe we could swap, you know, it'd be kind of a peace treaty. Okay. I'd like that. So would I. This is... No. Okay. You're right, you're right. I just need something! Let it go. Well, we've only got two days! Yeah. Okay. Hello? Hey, how goes the battle, Jenna? Hi. I wouldn't call it a battle. It's more like a friendly competition. A friendly competition? Wait a second. So, what, you guys are friends now? Yeah. Yeah, I guess it means we're friends. He's not completely driving you bananas? He is. But, you know, once he lets his guard down he's actually... He's a good guy. He has a kind heart. Stubborn but kind. Wait a second. A kind heart? What are you talking about? I... it just sounds like I hear something a little different in your voice. Do you like him? No. No. Of course not. I mean... No. Maybe. I don't know. God, he drives me crazy. You like Kevin Jenner. That's perfect. Oh, honey, I'm so sorry. That's not why I was calling. How's your story coming? Great. Yeah, it's great. I've got everything laid out. I just need to find the certificate from the 1930s. What? Explain. So, if I can find the certificate it means that I'll be able to save the inn that we're staying at. Which is... It's really the heart of the town. But they're going to demolish it. So, we're talking about, like, redemption and conflict and hope? Keep looking. This sounds interesting. I will! All right, honey. I'll check in with you later. Bye. To all those reading this, I encourage you to look at Christmas in a new way this year. Because with a little bit of luck and a dash of Christmas magic, you too could find yourself falling in love with the last person you ever expected. The end. Hi, Chris. Jenna. What a pleasant surprise. How are you, my dear? What's on your mind? Is that you? Hey, guys. Hi. So, you, you found Chris' man cave. Yes, yep. Came in for a little... pep talk. Chris, what time is the party tonight? Guests usually start arriving around 8:00. Is it formal? I don't think I have a... Yeah, I don't have anything fancy. Don't worry. Carol and I have found some elegant clothes for you to wear from our youth. Do they fit? Don't worry, we had them tailored just for you. Sorry to interrupt, Chris. I need your signature... the new sleigh insurance. Did you say sleigh insurance? You can't be too careful. Okay. Is James Cagney calling for his suit, say? What? Never mind. This Meg? Yes, add me to your phone already. Okay. One second. All right, there you go. Well, did you finish your article? I did actually. You found your inspiration. I did. Well, come on. You're leaving me hanging here. Spill! It's about how I found Christmas magic again. And how did you find it? By falling in love. With Jenna. That's so romantic. Does she know? No, no, not yet. I'm telling her tonight. We're swapping articles at this Christmas Eve Festival thingy. This is so exciting. You haven't been in love since the 10th grade when Cynthia Gilmore broke your heart. Hey, too soon, Megan. Too soon. Okay? Do you think she feels the same way? I do. Okay, hey, hey. I'm going to get off the phone with you right now so you don't go into cardiac arrest. Okay, okay. I'll... I'll see you tomorrow, big brother. Both of you. All right. One more thing! I need to find Jenna a traditional Jenner knitted stocking. Mom doesn't have time to knit one before tomorrow. I mean, unless we use... Yeah, he'd be happy to share it. Have fun tonight. Thanks. Top of the world, Ma. Hey, guys. What a great party. Isn't it something? Now, you wear that well. Yeah. Not like you. Hey, have you seen Jenna? There she is. I knew it would fit you. I knew it would fit. Thanks. You look... You look beautiful. Thank you. You don't look so bad yourself. Don Draper. Well, my friends, I must take off. What? Where? I've got a lot of things to get done before the night's end. And you have a lovely evening tonight. I have a feeling it will be very special. Thank you. Thanks, Chris. Have fun. Thanks, guys. What's wrong? I didn't finish my article. And I've never not finished an assignment. I don't want to think about it tonight. I just want to enjoy the party. I think we should dance. Yes. Where did you learn to dance? My dad always told me the way to a woman's heart wasn't through shiny things but the two-step. Does that work? Why don't you tell me? You know, Jenna, I know that I haven't been the easiest guy to work with. But I just... I have something to tell you. I really think that I'm... Jenna. Andrew? Andrew? Kevin, Andrew. Andrew. Kevin. Mind if I cut in? Be my guest. Happy Christmas Eve, Jenna. What are you doing here? I called your office and Simone's assistant told me you were here and I had to come surprise you. Yeah, I'm surprised. These past few days I have missed you so much. And I was afraid I wasn't ready to take the next step but now I am certain that I am ready. I've been lost without you. Andrew, I'm really confused. You said specifically... I know, I know, I know. ...that you didn't want to be in a relationship. I am so dumb for letting you go. I want to take you home. Home? I want you to finally meet my parents. I want to try again. Please. I haven't finished my article. I'm... I'm on assignment here. I can't just leave in the middle of everything. I know. I'm sorry I'm putting this all on you at once. But I can help you finish it. You know we make a great team. Come on, I got us a room near the airport. In the morning, we'll fly home and we'll go and spend Christmas Day with my parents together as a big family. And not here dancing. In some old timey movie. Come on. Wait, I just... I have to... Can you just give me a second? It's okay. You can go. Of course you want me to go, you get to keep your job. 'Cause I'm the competitive one? I look forward to reading your article tomorrow. Please tell your family that I said Merry Christmas. Yeah. Come in. Hi. Hey, Carol. How are you doing? I should've told her how I feel. I always do this. Well, there's nothing scarier than love. But it's the only thing worth risking everything for. Sweet dreams. You too. Hey. Hey. Hey, what time is it? Almost midnight. What are you looking for? Dash of the Christmas spirit. No way. I... The golden streak in the sky! Can you please tell me what we're staring at? You didn't see that? No. I'm going to turn in. We got an early flight tomorrow. Okay. The certificate. Christopher Kringle built this place in 1832. Jenna was right all along. Okay. I've got a deadline to make. We can do this. It's not too late. It's never too late. I cannot wait to get back to the city. Indiana is such a bore. So, tell me what I should expect from your family for Christmas. Do you guys have any traditions? I mean, it's not really all that festive. Christmas isn't really a big deal at the house. Okay. Do you have a tree that you decorate? Yeah. Yeah. The maid gets it out of storage and she decorates it. She does a good job. Do you, open stocking? You mean like stocking for kids? No, I mean... We'll just exchange gift cards and then sit around, watch the news after the big Christmas feast. Homemade feast. That's great. You know, I make a great apple pie. We can stop at the store and get some ingredients. You don't have to worry about any of that. Normally we just get this Thai takeout from a restaurant around the corner. It's great, you'll love it. Now boarding flight 223 to New York City. Great. That's us. Hang on a sec. Hi, Simone. I'm sorry. Honey, what? Why are you sorry? Your piece is amazing. My what? Well, you and Kevin's piece. I just can't believe you found that certificate! I am so impressed. Wait, the certificate was found? Do you know that your piece saved that inn from ever closing? It's trending on Twitter. People are already booking their stay for next year. I... How? I never... Honey, you should be so proud of yourself, honey. Well done. Be careful! Listen, I'll see you soon. These kids are driving me crazy. Okay? And hey, who knew he was such a softie? You're a lucky girl. Aw, merry Christmas, Jenna. Merry Christmas to you too. Hey, stop running around this house! Babe, we got to go. They're boarding. My article was published. That's amazing. Come on. Can you do that on the plane? No, no. Wait. You got to wait. Oh, my gosh. "How two writers found Christmas magic "just in time to save a historic inn. "By Jenna Hudson and Kevin Jenner." Wait, hang on. I'm confused. I thought you said you didn't finish it. He finished it for me. Us. He found the certificate in Chris' jacket. Final boarding call for flight 223 to New York. "I never believed that Christmas miracles existed "until I was snowed in with the one person "that embodied everything that Christmas should be about." "Thanks to the Winters Inn..." "Falling in love was the greatest Christmas miracle "I could've ever asked for." Okay. Look, we're going to miss our plane. What's your favourite article I ever wrote? What are you talking about? Where is this coming from? They're all amazing. Just tell me your favourite. My, okay. Let's see. Well. The... Okay, I'm sorry. But in my defense you never asked me to read any of them. But I promise as soon as we get back to the city I will read all of 'em. Okay? So, let's just get going. Jenna, are you coming? She's an alien. You don't see an alien. Where's an alien? In there. Where? Over there. Where's the alien? Over? In the tummy. In the stove? No, in your tummy. In my tummy? These are delicious as usual. Thank you, Wendy. I'm Alien Man, Rainbow Alien Man. I read your article this morning. It's really good. It's getting some nice buzz. Thank you. Simone should be happy. Have you heard from Jenna at all? There's still hope. Your article does say that Christmas miracles happen when you least expect them. Guys, guys. Thank you very much. Let's stop talking about work. Let's just enjoy Christmas morning together. All right? Okay. I'm proud of you, Uncle Kevin. Tori, thank you. Thank you very much. I'm proud of you. So is Santa. 'Cause you got all these gifts. Must be the carollers. Mom, I'll get it. Hi. I read your article. So, what do you think? I love you too. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. I have something for you. Okay. I think he'd want you to have this. I love it. Thank you. Open it up. You're giving it up? It's so good. I think the reigning champion deserves it. Merry Christmas! There they are. Just in time for a great game of Christmas charades. You got no food in your hands. Well, you know what? We'll play for food. Okay. All right. Go ahead. There's a spot for you right there. You don't want to play me, Eric. I'm the charades master. You know what I heard? There's a blizzard warning for New Year's Eve. Really? You want to get snowed in with me? I'd love to. We're playing without you! All right. Okay, guys. Yes. Here we come. So, we figured out one word. One word. Second word. Second word. Star? First word. Star fish. Fish? Star... Star? Shining star! Yes! Shining star. I told you I'm a natural at this game. There you are. Ooh. Another magical year. It was a great one. One of the best. They found the certificate. Well, of course he did. You know that. Merry Christmas, my darling. Merry Christmas. Santa.
