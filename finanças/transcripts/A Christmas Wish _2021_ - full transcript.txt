[air whooshing] [bells tinkling] [lively rhythmic music] ♪ Oh ♪ Oh oh oh ♪ Oh oh oh ♪ Oh ♪ Oh oh oh ♪ Oh oh oh ♪ Oh oh oh [Roz sighs] - Two bills in and already at 400. - Uh oh, is it bills time? - Mm, you got it. Just hope my paycheck can cover the important ones. I mean, of course my paycheck will cover everything. - Including this new gymnastics class I wanna try out next month? Oh, and kids in my algebra class, were talking about doing a Secret Santa. And, you know, I don't wanna be left out. - Okay, where's this class, how much is it gonna cost, and who's running it? - One of the teachers at school, Ms. Sherman, is running it with her sister. It starts after Christmas and it's only $300. - Whoa. I'll see how much is left over after I pay the bills, Esta. - [sighs] Hey, what about Dad? - What about him? - Maybe he can help pay for the things I need. - No. - Why not? - Because I don't need your father's money, okay? I can figure things out. - But Mom, you shouldn't have to struggle alone to take care of me. Look, I'll go talk to him. You won't have to. - First of all, struggle is a strong word. I'll figure out how to get those classes before registration, okay? - Okay. - Struggle. And I need a refill. [gentle music] [phones ringing] Where is she? I need to talk to her. - Where is who? - Principal Austin. I need to see her right now. Ms. McKenzie. Mrs. Austin's already left for the day. - What? No! No, she can't just lay me off and leave for the day like nothing ever happened. - I'm sorry, but she's gone. - Well, I need to see somebody. I need to see an administrator about this. - Okay. Try and calm down. Please have a seat. I'll try the AP, Mr. Matlock, for you, okay? - Calm down. Need to calm down? You still have a job. [gentle orchestral music] [Roz screaming] [dog barking] [Roz sighing] [phone ringing] Oh. Hey, sweetie. - [Esta] Hey, Mom, where are you? - I'm at, at school. Something came up I needed to take care of, why? - [Esta] Remember, you were supposed to come pick me up. - Oh. Oh, shoot, honey, I'm sorry. Give me about 30 more minutes to wrap things up. Can you stay at school that long? - [Esta] Yeah. I'll find something to do. See you soon, Mom. - Okay. Great. Bye-bye. [Roz sighs] [gentle music] [slow jazzy music] Dalton, what the hell are you doing in my house? - I'm pretty sure this is still my house. - I won it in the settlement, so it's my house. - Right. - Dad. - Hey, baby girl, come here. [chuckles] How are you? - What are you doing here? - Came to see you and to pay your mom a little visit. - Well, we don't have anything we need to discuss so you can get out. - Mom. - Hey, don't worry about it, baby. She can't get rid of me that easy. At least not tonight. - We don't have anything we need to discuss. What do you want? - Dad, can- - Eh eh. - [sighs] It's okay. I'll come get you after I'm done with your mom, okay? - Okay. - Thank you, Princess. - What do you want? - See you got the house all decorated nice and pretty. The tree is nice, but outside is really amazing, you know. I can't even front. You always had a thing when it came to decorating around Christmastime. - Thanks. What do you want? - Why the hell did you put a motion for child support? - Because we're divorced. - I've never had a problem with taking care of my child. I don't need a judge telling me that I'm on child support. - I don't trust you to do the right thing willingly so I'd rather have a court do it. - You don't trust me with money, girl. - No, mm-nn. - [laughing] Girl, are you tripping? No, I don't trust you with money, remember? You and money are the reason that we are divorced right now. - Here we go. Or did you forget? - Here we go. - What? You're terrible with finances. [both scoffs] What? I digress 'cause I'm not really trying to get into all that with you right now, okay? So listen, I have an account already set up for Esta. She can pull money from that whenever she needs, okay? - What, you have a what? - Yeah, because I don't need some uptight judge telling me how much I need to pay for my child. - Ooh. - My daughter can get- - Freaking [indistinct]. - whatever she needs from me, okay? - I'm not trying to go back and forth with you right now. I've had a horrible day. - Who cares? Nobody asked you that. And plus this is way more important than your day, all right? Plus, you've gotten way more than enough from me from the judge already. - I got enough from you? - Yeah. - All I got was this house and a whole lotta bills. - Well, whose fault is that? Because you asked for this divorce and you are the one who created these bills, all right? Am I lying? Where's the lie? Tell me I'm lyin'. - Dalton, you either go upstairs and be with our daughter or get out! But get out of my face! - [chuckles] You ain't right, girl. No, you ain't right for this, girl. - Ooh! Ooh, I hate him! [lively holiday music] [Roz sighs] Oh, what am I gonna do? [light knocking] Come in, sweetie. - This is the form I need you to fill out for gymnastics. The money's due December 14th and Ms. Sherman's holding the last spot for me and she's doing me a huge solid here. - Where are these classes held again? - At the center she runs with her sister. I think it's up north somewhere. I have the info. - Hm. - Oh, and don't worry about the price that's listed. Remember she's giving me a discount. - Yeah, 300 instead of 450. I need to get into this racket. - Mom. - Sorry. - Remember if you can't pay for it, I'm sure Dad can do it. - I'm sure. - Well, he also said he has an account set up for me for whenever I need it. - He told you that? - Yeah. Is he lying or something? - I wouldn't know. I don't control your father's money. - Well, he said I can use it whenever I need it. So might as well use it. - Enough about your father's deep pockets, okay? - Understood. Not trying to be all in your business, but why was there so much school stuff in your car earlier? - It's just extra stuff I don't need in the classroom. Decided to store it there. - Okay. Gotcha. - You need to go to bed. We have an early morning. What, why? Tomorrow's Saturday. - Yeah, we're setting up the food pantry at the new church, remember? This'll be great for the church and the community. - Um, I'm so sorry, but I totally forgot to tell you that I'm doing breakfast tomorrow with Dad so he can help me with my algebra and yeah, can I make it up to you, please? - Sure. - Thank you, Mom, good night. [gentle music] - [sighs] Fine. [bells jingling] - Well, things are really looking good here at the food pantry. Thank you so much. - Thank you so much. I really enjoy doing this. And you are? - Oh, sorry. I'm Noel Preston. Pastor Preston. - Oh! Oh my goodness. [both laughing] It's an honor to meet you. Thank you for allowing me to do this for your church. - Oh no, no, no, no. When you contacted us about doing this, trust me, we were the ones blessed. - It's important to bless others when we're in a position to do so. Yeah? - Amen, sister. Amen. Well, I guess I should let you get back to work as I have some work to do myself. [chuckles] As I will down the hall in my office if you need me. - Okay. - You have a great rest of your day. - Thanks. You too. [Noel chuckles] [light upbeat music] [Roz chuckles] ["Jingle Bells"] Hey. - Hey. - Your dad help you with your homework? - He sure did. Dad's awesome. I really miss us. - I know, baby, but for now we need to detangle these lights so we can get up in the backyard. - [sighs] Mom? - Hm? - I really miss us. Especially during Christmastime. Not spending Christmas together as a family is gonna be different. Like I don't even know how to do that. - I know, baby, but we just have to learn how to deal with that. - But do we really? Mom, I wanna spend Christmas together as a family, even though we aren't. I know it's the one thing I want for Christmas. - What if your dad isn't available? - How could he not be available for Christmas for me? How could you not wanna do this? I want my family for Christmas. It'd be the bestest gift ever. - Hm. We'll see. But for now let's get the yard decorated so we can have a festive atmosphere around here. Need more lights. - Okay. What child doesn't want their parents together for Christmas? [gentle somber music] [gentle holiday music] - Oh. [gentle music] Oh. [gasps] [sighs] Still works. Dalton bought this for me when Esta was born. [phone ringing] Oh. Hey, Dalton. - [Dalton] Hey. You got time to talk? - What about? - [Dalton] You know, holiday plans, you know, since it's the first year we won't be together and all. - Yeah, well maybe we should. - [Dalton] Oh really, we should? - Esta mentioned it to me and maybe we should hang out with her for her sake. - [Dalton] Okay. That sounds cool to me. - I, um, I'll hit you back later. I'm kind of in the middle of something. - [Dalton] Yeah, okay. Cool. We'll just talk about it later. - Okay. Bye. [gentle orchestral music] - Good morning, Mom. - Good morning. - I just need something quick to take because Shayda's mom is on her way to pick me up. - That's fine. You're not even gonna warm it up? - Nah, I'm good. Why are you still here here? Usually leave before me. - I just have something to take care of before work, so yeah. - Okay. [lively ringtone ringing] Oh, Shayda's here. Gotta go, Mom. Bye. - Bye. - Love you. - Love you too. Be good. - [Esta] I will. [tense music] [door clattering] [lively holiday music] - Okay. It's December 10th. Got laid off on Friday. So that means I get one more check. Hm. Ooh. - [Noel] Hey, good morning. - Good morning to you. - What's that? I'll get that for you. - Thanks. - All right. [chuckles] Uh, what brings you here so early? - I called to check in and they said Mr. Joe was sneaking cans of corn out under his shirt. I said, let him take the corn. I'll bring some more. [Noel laughing] - Of course, that's what we're here for, right? - Yeah. - So, what do you do during the day? - I teach at a school, but not today. Crazy situation. - Well, you wanna tell me about it? I'm good with counseling people. I do it for a living. - I, I don't think I need counseling, Pastor. I just need to stay busy to keep my mind off of certain things. - Okay, okay. I totally understand. I mean, I know what you're going through. - I don't think you know what I'm going through, Pastor. - Listen, you have the power to fix whatever it is that's troubling you at the moment. Just find it within yourself. Oh no, I got it. [door clatters] - Just gotta find another job before the little genius figures out anything. [door clattering] - Oh, Mom, you're home. - Yeah. Been home about five, 10 minutes. - You musta flew outta work when the kids left. - I guess so. How was school? - It was school. Remember that Secret Santa I was telling you about? Well, that's happening. The class agreed on spending no more than $20 on a gift. - $20? When I did it, it was five. - Some kids wanted it to be a hundred. - What kinda jobs do these kids have? - Oh, and Ms. Sherman asked about the money for gymnastics. She wanted to know if I was still interested. I told her yeah. Just waiting on you to hand over some money. - I'll get it. We have time. - Okay. [sighs] I'm gonna go start doing my math project. - Oh. Need help? - No. Dad's the math whiz. I'm good. [somber music] - Dad's the math whiz. Finance whiz. Secret handshake whiz. Might as well knight him Sir Dalton McKenzie. - Hey, Dad. What are you doing tomorrow after school? Um, I wanna go over there and talk to you. Bye. [gentle holiday music] - Pasta. You cool with that? - Yeah. I'm gonna hang out with my dad tomorrow. You cool with that? - Why? - Because I wanna spend time with him. Is there a problem? - Nope. - Cool. - "I wanna spend time with him. Is there a problem?" [Roz sighs] [Roz tsks] ["Jingle Bells"] Dalton said you were supposed to be good luck. Right now you just feel like a hoodoo doll. Everything that could go wrong is going wrong. So... I need you to be good luck. [light jazzy music] - Come on in, baby. Come on. - Dad, your tree is naked. - I know. I just picked it up yesterday. I knew you was coming so I figured we could decorate it together. - [Esta] Excellent. [tense music] - [Dalton] What's wrong, baby girl? - I gotta talk to you, Dad. - About what? What's the matter. - I wanna join gymnastics, but I asked Mom to pay for it and she isn't giving me the money yet. - Oh, so now you just coming to ask me for the money, right? - Well, yeah. You are my dad. Plus I just don't think that Mom has the money for it right now. She's always talk about paying the bills first. Mama's become, I don't know, weird about money. - All right, but, you gotta understand now she's the head of the household over there now, you know. And it's not easy. So you gotta cut her a little slack. - I guess. - It's just gymnastics, right? - Well, why don't you just give me the money instead? It's only $300. - $300? For gymnastics? - It's for a private class. Anyway, let's talk about something else. - Well okay, I don't blame her. I can teach you how to flip. You know that, right? [Esta scoffs] Well, look, what about Christmas? Mom said she would actually be fine with the idea of us bringing in Christmas together as a family. - [chuckles] Really? Are you? - Yeah. Of course I am. I get to be with my baby girl. What do you think? - What about seeing Mom? - I mean, [chuckles] that'd be nice too I guess. - You guys trip me out. - Where's all this talk... [chuckles] Where's this coming from, little girl. - You two. I don't get why y'all are not together. Can you explain it? - There's a lotta details that happened between me and your mom, okay? But you don't need to know all that because you're too young anyway. - Well, tell me this. Do you wish it never happened? - [sighs] Come here. To me when it comes to your mom, there's a lotta things that I wish didn't happen, okay? - [sighs] I told Mom that I wanted to spend Christmas together but that's not the only thing I want. I want us back together as a family, Dad. Do you ever feel like that? - Yeah, of course I do. Look, I never wanted any of this separate holiday stuff. I mean, it's weird. You know, you got a tree at your mom's house, a tree here. This is never what I wanted for us. - Then fix it. - I can't. I mean, it's not all on me. It's your mom, and you know your mom. She gets what she wants. And I guess this is what she wanted. - Let's just say it's time that we get what we want, our family back together. - Yeah. Look, you're doing all this talking. Are you gonna help me with this tree or not? I need you to get it pretty for me 'cause I'm not gonna do it by myself. - [chuckles] Okay, okay, Dad. - Come on. [sighs] I'm gonna go upstairs and change clothes. [gentle somber music] [bells jingling] [door clattering] Good. - Yeah I can't wait to eat it. - It better be good. [Esta chuckling] - Well, it's about time. - Hey, Mom, we brought dinner. - Dinner's cooking. You should've called and told me if you were bringing food. - Come on, Roz. It's just food. - It's always something with you. - Mom, come on. - Esta, go upstairs. - Bye. Really? Was all that really necessary? - Is it necessary for you to bring her home late? - Roz, [laughing] it's only eight o'clock. - She has school tomorrow. - Well, she's already done her homework and I know it's right, because I helped her, so why are you tripping? - Are you finished? - No, actually I'm not. She tells me that you can't buy some of the things that she needs. - What? - Yeah. You having financial issues again? - If I am having financial issues again, it's because you're refusing to pay child support. - So, which is it? You can pay for the things she needs or you can't because I won't give you your little child support money? - It's both. I can hold things down here, but you gotta take care of your daughter. - Whoa, whoa. I take care of my daughter and I will get her whatever she needs, okay? - Good. - Yeah. Good. I just don't think I need to be on child support right now. - Well, I do and that's that so let's get up on outta here. Come on. - Really? - After you. - Wow. Is all this really necessary? - [Roz] Yep. - [Dalton] [laughing] Okay. Cute. Real cute. - And I will drop her off after we have our breakfast on Christmas morning. - No, no, no. Esta thinks that we're spending Christmas together as a family. She's already excited about it. Come on. - She'll get over it. - Wow. - Hurry up. [door slamming] [light knocking] You got no right telling your father I can't pay for anything. - Mom, I didn't tell him that. - Whatever you told him, don't do it anymore. How dare you literally give him the ammo to use against me. - I... [panting] [door slamming] [gentle holiday music] - Oh. Hey. - Hi. Looking good. - [sighs] Thanks. You care to sit? - Sure. It's been a weird couple of weeks. Lost a job that I loved. Like it feels like everything is coming down on me at once. Like life is just tough in general. Until I come here. I always feel better when I leave. - It's, it's the spirit of Christmas. [chuckles] And this building. It brings a lot of joy for a lot of people. - Well, I have some work to do in the pantry. So I'm gonna get started- - Mrs. Roz McKenzie. - Miss Roz McKenzie. - Please, forgive me, Miss Roz McKenzie. Things are gonna get better for you. I know it's all gonna work out and if you need anything and I do mean anything, I'll be around. - I'll keep that in mind. [Noel sighs] [light holiday music] [footsteps clattering] - Oh, you're in a good mood. - I suppose so. Breakfast? - No thanks. You know what's in the bag. - Oh. Hey, I wanna apologize for the other day. I shouldn't have snapped at you and I'm sorry. - It's cool, Mom. - Don't be late. Oh. [chuckles] - Love you, Mom. - I love you too. You look so cute. - [Esta] [giggles] Thank you. - I'm a great shopper. [light upbeat music] [gentle holiday music] [door creaking] - Miss McKenzie, you could come in. - Okay. Hi. Thank you so much. - You sure you don't need a ride? - Nah, my mom's on her way. - Where's your mom been? - What do you mean, at work? - Nope, my sister goes to the school that your mom works at. - Yeah, I know. - Your mom ain't been there in like a week. - Wait, what? She's up every morning cooking breakfast and- - Your mom's classes were split with the other second grade class. Oh, your mom's coming up. See you tomorrow. ["Jingle Bells"] [upbeat music] - Got your popcorn. - Yay! [comical music] [dynamic music] You know, Shayda told me something that blew my mind. - Let's talk. [woman screaming] - You know she has a little sister that goes to your school, right? She says that you haven't been there in a week. - Hm. - Isn't that crazy? She says that your class got split into other second grade classes. [Roz sighs] Mom, isn't Shayda wrong? Right? [somber music] - Esta, I did not want you to find out this way. - Mom, why aren't you at school? What's going on? - I got laid off. - What? When? - Last Friday. - But you're up every morning dressed like you're going to work. Where have you been going? - I've been going on interviews and helping out at the food pantry. - Wow, Mom. - Let me start from the beginning. Remember when you asked why I had all the classroom stuff in my car? - Yeah. You said that you had to bring home some extra stuff. - It wasn't extra stuff. That was the day I got laid off. - No, no, no, no, no. They can't do that to you. You're a first year teacher. They said they didn't have enough students to justify keeping my position open. - But they did when you first got it. Why is it different now? - I don't know, baby. It's just the, the drama of working in public education. [light emotional music] - You're so calm about this. - Mm. - How? - Well, I have to be, or else I would be worrying and, and it would rub off on you and you'd be worrying like you are now. It's gonna be okay, baby. We'll get through this. I even had an interview today. - And how did that go? - It went really well. It went great. Haven't heard back from the principal yet, but I should hear something soon. Oh. Cry. - Do you really believe that, Mom? Do you really believe that we're just fine? Do you really just tell yourself that at night and actually believe it? - Esta. Esta, I have to. I have to. Or else I'd be worrying about, about food and bills and things that we need and it'll be okay. We've gotta stay positive about this. All right? - [sighs] No wonder why you couldn't pay for the gymnastics. I feel awful stressing you about it. - No, no. No, you deserve to do what you want. And if you really wanna take those classes, I'm okay with you asking your dad. I know he won't have a problem giving it to you. - Really? - Yeah. Yes, dry those tears. - Okay. I'll go call him. - Why don't you do that. [gentle somber music] [light upbeat music] - Hey, Mom. - Hey. - Wanna take me to school today? - Uh, I can if you need me to. - [chuckles] Oh, I'm just messing with you. I have a ride. What are you gonna be up to? - Oh, stuff. Maybe plan out our Christmas breakfast menu. Search for a little present. - Mom. I don't want anything. - Honey, yes, you do. - Okay, I want what I told you before about our family. But don't spend any money. - Sweetie, I put a little something aside for Christmas gifts, okay, Love? We don't have to worry about that. - Mom, yes we do. You have to keep your money for the real things. Don't you ever worry about running out? - You let me worry about the finances and you handle school, okay? - Okay. [ringtone ringing] [horn honking] Oh, Shayda's outside. - Oh. - I'll see you later, Mom. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye, honey. Have a good day. - [Esta] You too. [keyboard clacking] [light upbeat music] [message alert beeps] [gentle somber music] [Roz sighs] - Messing up my hard work? - Oh. No. Hi, Pastor. [Noel chuckling] - Hi. - Christmas is just days away. - Yes, indeed it is. - Time flies too quickly. - Ah, so what's going on? - Same crap. Life. Uh... [Noel chuckles] Feel like I'm on a hamster wheel sometimes just running in place. Do hamster wheels ever go backwards? Sure feels like it. You know I got laid off from my job last week. And I've been trying to interview for other teaching positions. I even had one on Friday. - Yeah. - I thought it went great. Thought for sure I'd get it. Then I get word this morning that they went with someone else. - [Noel] [sighs] Oh. - So I just don't know. - Yeah, well, getting laid off. Unfortunately I know about that. I was laid off my first year in education. - [Roz] You were in education? - Yeah. I was a teacher for 10 years. [chuckles] I had third grade my first year and yeah, I got laid off, you know, budget cuts. Then I got hired at another school and had a fifth grade for nine years. - I would've never guessed. - Oh, well, I kinda stumbled into it. My mother was a teacher so I think I just stayed on that path. [both chuckle] I, um, it was hard for me too, after they laid me off, so I started to question if education was my calling and started focusing on the philanthropy and ministry work. You know, the summer they laid me off I really started to struggle with wanting to open my own church, being a minister or yes, going back to education. - I take it you chose ministry? - No, actually both. Manage all my mission work and I didn't wanna stop helping people. Think I went back to teaching because of that and wanted to help children and keep them on the right path. - Yeah. I miss working so much. Just too much time to spin out of control especially emotionally. - Yeah. - I've gotta keep a cool head for my, my daughter. Don't want her absorbing all this energy, but it's getting harder. - Well, I can only imagine. Does she know? - Uh, she found out before I could break it to her. - Oh. No, how? - [chuckles] One of her nosy little friends told her everything. [Noel sighs] - Oh, it's gonna take time, but it will work out. - It'll work out? - Yes. - [laughing] How? How? I've got a teenage daughter who needs things, lots of things. Legal fees, the ghosts of student loans past. Pastor Noel, it's expensive to breathe. - Okay, Roz, I get it. We've all been there. But maybe you're looking at this all the wrong way. - My eyes don't deceive me when I open up the mail. - Yeah, but your focus on how fast you need to get another job might be wrong. [gentle emotional music] Look, sometimes we need to lose something to truly figure out what and who we need in our lives. Good things are gonna happen for you though. [Esta panting] - Daddy, oh my god, come in! - Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Come in! - Hey! I got your message, why are you rushing me over here like this? - Because Mom's not home. - So? - Come on. I gotta talk to you. Come here! - Oh ooh. Okay, baby girl, tell me what's going on. You in trouble or something? - No, Dad, gosh. - Then what is it? - I need money for teenager things. - Money? You coulda called me and told me that over the phone. - It's better to happen in person because it's gotta happen before Mom comes home. - Why are you so worried about Mom coming home? - I need $2,000. - $2,000? [scoffs] Girl, you talking crazy. You're too young to be asking for money like that. What you need, bail money or something? - You said you have an account set up for me for whenever I need things, and well, I need things. - $2,000 worth of things? Uh uh. No, no, don't you try to hit me with the big eyes trick. I'm not giving you $2,000 unless you tell me what's going on. - Mom lost her job. [Esta sighs] - What? No. - A friend told me, but it's true. A few weeks ago. I mean, who fires someone before Christmas? - [sighs] Wait, so you saying she's been out of work for weeks? - Yeah, but you can't tell her that I told you. Just gimme the money to give to her, okay? - 2000 bucks? And then what? You don't even get an allowance. Where you gonna magically get $2,000 from? - She's struggling, Dad. You guys barely even talk so she ain't gonna ask you. This is the only way. - All right, wait, look, calm down, okay? I'll handle it. Just let me handle it. - No, no. You can't tell her. - It's okay, if she says something, I'll take the heat for it. Don't worry about it, all right? [Dalton sighs] [door clattering] Okay, look, I'm gonna go talk to her, all right? Calm down. Just finish your work. Stop stressing out. You're too young for that, all right? - Dalton, what are you doing in my house again? Esta let you in? - Yeah, she did. - She's home early. - She is. What about you? Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Just long day. Tired and hungry. - At work, right? - Why? You don't care. - [chuckles] Come on [drowned out by cups clanking]. You know that I care. Just can't turn feelings off for somebody, especially after 14 years of marriage. - No? Try. - Try. So work, you said it was crazy today, right? - The usual, but I'm good. - 'Cause it's funny, 'cause I called your school today. I wanted to talk to you about Esta. - She okay? - Esta is fine. But they told me that you weren't there today. - So? - So? - I don't feel like playing games with you, Dalton. - Well, I don't feel like playing games with you either, Roz. Come on. I know you got laid off of work. - Who told you that? It's not true. - Are you, are you gonna do this right now? Come on. So you're gonna sit up here and lie to me? Talk to me, tell me what's going on. - Fine. I got laid off a few weeks ago and I've been lying about going to work. There. You happy? So go ahead. Talk your trash, make your insults, go right ahead. - Roz, I don't wanna insult you. I'm not gonna talk trash about you. - That's hard to believe. - Why do you think I wanna do that? Roz, can you just cut the tough girl act out for one second and let me know what's going on with you? You don't have to do everything alone, okay? You're not superwoman. Stop it. - [chuckles] Are you serious right now? - [Dalton] Yeah, I'm serious. - No, Dalton, I know you and you love to be right. - Come on. Roz. Listen, I'm serious, okay? To lose your job the way that you did right before Christmas, I know this has to be hard on you, all right, so just let me know what you need. - Dalton, I don't want your pity. I can handle this. I'll find another job in no time. - Then why haven't you found one yet? - I've been looking. But I can handle this on my own. - That's the point. It's not about you, all right? Look at me. Esta's involved, okay? And that little girl is worried sick about you. She's too young to be stressing out like this. And she doesn't need to see you scrapping and fighting trying to get things together before Christmas. I don't wanna see that either. And regardless if you believe me or not, you don't have to do everything on your own, okay? So if you're not gonna do it for yourself, then please at least do it for Esta. - No. Nope. I don't want your money and I want you out of my house. - Roz, come on. - No, Dalton. Get out. - Can we please not do this right now? - Oh, we're not doing this right now. Take your coat. [Dalton grunts] Get out. - Regardless of how you feel, the offer still stands. I wanna help you. - Goodbye. Esta! [tense music] - Where's Dad. - [Roz] I threw him out. - Mom, why? He can help us. - Somehow he knows [somber music] I got laid off. He said he called the school looking for you today, but I don't think that's true. - I told him, okay? - Esta, why? - Mom, he can help us. Even if it's for a short time, he can help us. Dad won't care. He's not trying to be mean or trying to show off. He's just trying to take care of us until you get back on your feet. Mom, you gotta let him help us. Please. [tense music] - Gotta think about, this young lady. But right now we need to have a sit down about what happens in this house stays in this house. Come on. Go. [fingers snapping] - Roz. What happened? Talk to me. - Yesterday was not good. He knows. - About what, your job situation? - Yep. - How? Did you tell him? - No, my daughter did. - I see. Are you okay with that? - No, I'm not okay with that. [sighs] I understand why she did it. She's always worried about me, us, concerned about what might happen, but I can't help but feel like I'm living with a little mole. - Mole? Why? - [Roz] Because he's my ex-husband. He doesn't need to know everything. Hello, boundaries. - Yeah, but whatever you're going through affects him because of your daughter. Don't you think he has a right to know? - No, it's not his business. And, and, and get this, he wants to help me. My ex-husband wants to help me. [scoffs] Can you believe that? - [Noel] Wait a minute, Roz. What is so wrong with that? [Roz sighs] - Why would he wanna do that, huh? - Maybe because he cares. He doesn't wanna see you in a bad situation. - Oh, please. He wants to stick it to me. That's what he wants to do. Wants to make it seem like I can't, I can't make it without him, Mr. Auditor. - Why do you think the only way he wants to help you is financially? - How else would he help me? - Emotional support. [Roz scoffs] Huh? Being there for you and Esta? Maybe, maybe he just wants to be in your corner while you're going through this. - Nope. No, he wants me to feel bad. He wants to swoop in like a savior. He's been doing that the last few years of our marriage. I'm not gonna give him that satisfaction, not anymore. - Seems like you resent him as a provider. - What? No. No, he always tried to make it seem like I was wasteful and reckless and he had to save me with another balance transfer. No, not anymore. - You know what? - Done. - With all due respect, Roz, I think you have a few hangups and perhaps some projections that come from your own actions. What if you are looking at this through the wrong lens? - I have 20/20 vision, Pastor. With all due respect. - Look, your husband is being concerned about you. And he just wants to help and it seems to me with no strings attached. - Why would he do that? Hm? - Because he still cares. [Roz scoffs] And he loves you. And deep down I know you know that I'm right. If he didn't have these feelings for you, then he wouldn't have offered to help you in any way. Now, even you can admit that. Yes? [Noel sighs] All right. All right, all right. [gentle somber music] You don't have to admit it, but, Roz, don't be ashamed to accept help from him. Sometimes we have to realize that not everyone has an ulterior motive or are out to stick it to us. Think about it. If the people who came in here to get food from this pantry were too proud and too ashamed to accept help from anyone, they'd be out there on the streets doing God knows what trying to survive. Sometimes you have to just let go of being proud. [Noel sighs] Talk to him. And just talk to him and see what help he'll truly offer. Roz, look at me. Look at me. You need this. [chair rattling] [bells jingling] [light knocking] - Hey. - [Roz] May I come in? - Yeah. - I'd like to talk. - I mean, you wanna take your coat off or- - Uh, I don't know. Not, not yet. Right now I just need you to listen. Can you do that? - Yeah, I'm listening. - Okay. - First I just want to apologize for how I reacted the other day. - For which part? - A good part of it. But you gotta understand this. How, how much it might sting for my ex to see me down and out. - I wouldn't feel no type of way about that. - Yeah right. - All right, maybe I would just a little or something, but I wanna apologize too. 'Cause I'm sorry for the way that I came at you. - Thank you. - Yeah. I just didn't want you to know. Didn't want anyone to know, Esta included. - That's my point. Why would you even wanna go through all that, you know, alone when you don't have to? - You gotta understand this. I need to go through this alone. I can't have you bailing me out of another financial jam. God knows I didn't care for it when we were married, Dalton. - Is this some type of insult? - Does it sound like one? - Yeah, when you say it like that. Listen, you have to understand, I didn't get you out of financial jams because I was trying to belittle you or make you feel like less of a person. I did it because I care about you. You're my wife. I mean, my family. I am supposed to take care of you. All right, I know I am, I was, you were my wife. Okay? - But it made me feel so small, Dalton. Like, like you didn't trust me to handle any responsibility for anything. Do you know, my dad used to give me an allowance and then hold it and then ration it out. Why would you give someone something if you're just gonna control it, hm? - Yeah. - It was like he didn't even trust me. And all I wanted was some ice cream. [Dalton chuckles] You didn't trust me either, Dalton. Admit it. - Well... Not gonna admit that, but I will admit that I let my business rollover into our marriage a little bit. - Yeah, Mr. Auditor. - [laughing] So way to go. [chuckles] Auditor. - Oh my gosh, I married my dad. - Wait, whoa, whoa. Slow down now. - No, no, no. You know what I mean in a child psychology sense. - Oh, right. - But with you, it felt like I wed the entire IRS. - The IRS, right? At least the reception was a little exciting. - Not one of your people had any rhythm. - Not an ounce. [both chuckling] So are you telling me you didn't want me to find out about you losing your job because you thought I was gonna treat you like a spreadsheet? - That, yeah. And it just, it's not your business, Dalton. - It's none of my business? - [Roz] No. - Look, I need a drink 'cause you stressing me out. [Dalton sighs] - I need a drink too, 'cause you're stressing me out. - Well, I guess we gonna be drinking. It's none of your business? Did you forget about that little beautiful, brown, big-eyed girl that we have together? She is my business, okay? You losing your job affects her. So in turn, that affects me, okay? You missing out on checks, next thing you know you out on the street with my daughter? Uh uh. I don't care what we got going on, the past or whatever, we're here right now. And you have to understand something about me. I will never let that happen. - I understand that about you, but you have to understand why you have to at least let me try to handle this. - [sighs] You will handle it. You'll get another position. Come on. I've seen you struggle before but I also seen you reach all your goals. Just like you made it through school when I was hitting you up and all over your line. Yeah. So you'll get it done, but in the meantime- - You still wanna help me? - Yeah. I do. Christmas is in what, nine days? Not 'bout to have our daughter stressing out over me and you and our problems. Why can't you stop being so proud for one minute? - I'm not being proud. I'm being cautious. - Cautious? Cautious for what? What are you being cautious for? Don't. Why can't you just take it as a, a genuine offer, you know? Good guy in the spirit of Christmas. Does that work for you? Please, just take it as a genuine offer 'cause I don't want anything from you in return, all right? All right, I'm lying. I do want something from you in return. - What's that? - Can you please just not see this as a rescue operation and acknowledged the only reason why I'm doing this is because I still really care about you. - Okay. Okay. Deal. - [Dalton] Deal. - I um, I really appreciate this. - [Dalton] Don't worry about it. - And I promise I'll pay you back. - You don't have to pay anything back. You know the account we opened for the house in emergencies? You can just pull the money from there. - You didn't scoop your portion out right away? 'Cause I did. - Trust me, I know you did. [Roz chuckles] And no, the money is still there. I left it for emergencies for Esta and you. - Good on you. - Yeah. - Wow. - Speaking of Esta, what are you getting that girl for Christmas? - I asked her what she wanted the other day and she said she didn't want anything I had to buy. However, she did mention one thing. She wanted us to be- - [Bothy] Back together- - For the holidays, right. - Yeah. Mm hm. - [sighs] That's our baby girl. - [Roz] Yep. - Do you know when you got laid off, she asked me for $2,000. She said it was for personal things. - [laughing] Really? - Really. She was gonna take all of that money and she was gonna give it to you. - Hm. She's something else. [chuckles] - Yes. She is something else. Just like her mother. You know what? Maybe we can give her what she wants for Christmas. Maybe we can spend time together as a family. - Maybe you're right. She's a good girl. - [Dalton] Right. - We certainly put her through the ringer with our issues. [light upbeat music] I think that'll, that'll be just fine. - I think it'll be great. - I should go. Yeah. - Gonna rush out, bad? - You know, I gotta go do something about my life. - [Dalton] You sure? - Yeah. And, and, and you know, whatever I use, I'll put back. - You don't owe me anything, Roz. - [Roz] Yeah, and, and I'll call you and figure out where we spend Christmas. - Hm. I really appreciate that. - Hm. Okay. I guess I should get outta here. Okay, talk to you later. Bye. [dramatic music] [Roz sighs] [Dalton sighs] [dogs barking] [Roz sighs] [Roz laughing] Yeah. [Roz sighs] [comical music] - [Woman] Wah hoo! [woman shouting] - Mom. - [Roz] I went to see your dad. - Really? Uh oh. - Don't worry. It wasn't bad. I apologized to him. - [chuckles] Say what? - Yeah. And he told me about the $2,000 you asked for. You're crazy for that. But thank you. - You're welcome, Mom. So are you gonna let Dad help us? - I am. - Really? So we don't have to struggle anymore. - What did I tell you about that word struggle? We just hit a bumpy patch. He's gonna help smooth it out a bit, temporarily. - See, Dad isn't so bad. - I never said he was, not to you. - You know, Mom, he still cares about you. Do you know that? - He said something like that. - Do you still care about him? - All you need to know, my dear, is that our Christmas plans are back on track. Yep. We're gonna spend Christmas together like a family. Just like you asked. - Because we still are a family, Mom. It doesn't matter if you guys split up. Which, why did you guys split up again? - Why did we split up? Hm. - Y'all just need to get it together. [upbeat music] - You just need to stay out of grown folks' business. [Esta chuckles] Yes! Go Dad! [Esta giggling] [slow upbeat jazzy music] [lively music] [phone ringing] - Hello? Yes, this is Roz McKenzie. Oh no. It's not too late. [tense music] Tomorrow. Yeah. 1:15? [Roz chuckles] I'll see you then. Woo! [lively upbeat music] - [Esta] Oh my gosh, Mom, what's going on? - I just got a job interview for tomorrow, baby. - For real? - Yes, for real. Oh, Esta, I feel like this could be it. It has to be. - I really hope you get it, Mom. - Me too. What should you wear? - I gotta find something to really wow this principal for tomorrow. Oh, I... Which one? - The black blazer is fine. - Yep. - Well, Roz, it's been a pleasure spending this time with you today. You'll hear from us one way or the other, okay? - Okay. Sounds good. - But, you know what, wait. Let me show you around. [gentle music] - I'd love to see the school. [upbeat music] - Well, thank you, Sophie. [indistinct speaking] [light knocking] Oh, we'll get back with you. - Hello, Pastor. - Roz, hello. Wow, you look so much more happier today. - That's because for once I really am. I just came from an incredible job interview, second graders, right before they turn into gremlins. - [laughing] Oh, that is good, Roz. You know that position is yours. Accept it. - Oh, the principal said she had one more interview to do that day and she'll let me know first thing tomorrow morning. - Yeah, well, she's going to hire you. - How can you be so sure? - I just know. - Thank you. You know, feels odd when I'm in your presence, almost like you know me and what's going to happen in my life. - [Noel] Ah. - You a psychic? - [laughing] No. No, no, I just think that if it's the right thing for you, then it'll happen. I mean, look at me, I am a testament to that statement. - Yeah. - By the way, how things go with you and Dalton? - Oh, we worked out the help thing. I'm going to accept his offer. Not gonna fuss about it. - Because he still cares deeply for you? You ever wonder why the two of you got a divorce when you clearly still love each other? - How do you know these things? - I mean, love is love, right? - [chuckles] Well, I guess so. Honestly, sometimes I do wonder about the divorce and if I acted too hastily. I don't know. - Ah, yes, you did. [chuckles] But it's okay. He gets it now and so do you. Now after you work out the budget and figure out which of the finances are a priority, you will develop a tool to be more savvy with your finances. - You might be on to something there. What do you know about that job I just interviewed for? [gentle music] - Only that it's yours. [Roz chuckles] ["Jingle Bells"] - Hm. Time for another grocery run. - Mom, your phone keeps vibrating. Someone must really trying to get in contact with you. - Whoa, these are school system numbers. - [chuckles] Two? Go, Mom. [Roz chuckles] [tense music] - [Ms. Mosley] Good morning, Ms. McKenzie. This is Ms. Mosley calling on behalf of Mrs. Austin. If you have not accepted [light upbeat music] another position, she was wondering if you would like to return to work. - Mom, you got your job back! - Whoa. That is unexpected. - Sure is. I mean, they put you all through this mess only to want you back. Who does that? - Shh, shh, there's another one. - [Miss Miller] Hello, Mrs. McKenzie. This is Miss Miller calling you back in regards to the interview. After reviewing all of the other candidates, it would be my honor to offer you the position. - [Both] Oh my gosh! - Oh! - If you could call me back today, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. And I hope to hear from you very soon. - Oh my gosh, Mom, you got two jobs to choose from. Whoa. What are you gonna doing? - I'm gonna sit down before I pass out. [Esta chuckling] - So Mom, we don't have to worry anymore, right? We can just enjoy our Christmas and you don't have to stress about finding a job. - Esta, this is the best news ever. - [chuckles] Right? And well, if I had to make the decision, I already know what I would choose. - Oh yeah? - It's not easy for you? - Well, it's 50/50, maybe 90/10. Do I wanna go back to a school that laid me off? That principal didn't even have the decency to tell me to my face. - Oh, are you serious? - She left a note in my mailbox. - [sighs] Wow. That's cold. That school would never see my face again unless I was truly desperate. - And we are never desperate, honey. You're not even gonna toast it? - Nope. - Let me call them back before they give my job away. - Yep. - Hi, Principal Miller please. Hi, this is Roz McKenzie. Miss Miller, about that job offer. I absolutely accept. [Esta giggling] Oh, sure. See you soon. [Esta giggling] Bye. [both shouting and laughing] [Esta laughing] Oh. [gentle holiday music] [slow gentle music] [footsteps thudding] - Ah, hello, Roz. - [chuckles] How do you do that? - [chuckles] Ah, it's just a little trick I learned over the years. - It's for you. - Oh. [chuckles] Thanks for the gift. - It's my pleasure. You're welcome. - Oh, you are so different now. - Hm. - You're in a better place. - You got that right. [Noel chuckling] - I got the job. [chuckles] - Oh, I knew you would. [chuckles] - You know what's crazy is that I wanted to cry today I was so happy, but I contained myself. Feels great to be back. - Yeah. I am so happy for you, Roz. - The crazy thing is, is that the clerk from my old school called the same day the new principal called. They wanna give me my old job back. I'm not going back to a place that let me go. - I'm glad. - [Roz] Yeah. - I told you that if it's meant to be you'll get it. - You sure did. [chuckles] - Does this mean I'm not gonna see you around here anymore? - Oh, no. No, I definitely wanna continue my volunteer work here. I wanna help you continue this pantry throughout the whole year. - Oh, that's perfect. I love it. - You gotta meet my daughter too. - That would be nice. Does she and your ex know about your great news? - Esta definitely knows. Haven't told Dalton yet, but I will tonight. - Excellent. - Well, in case I don't see you again, I wanna wish you and your daughter and your husband a Merry Christmas. - Husband? No, Pastor, you will see me again. I told you that. Merry Christmas to you too. [gentle music] [Noel sighs] - Well, off to the next person who needs a friend. - [chuckles] I may be turning into Miss Auditor. Ah. Yep. I can do this. [doorbell ringing] Still allergic to hats and gloves I see. - Ha, you got all the jokes. Can I come in? - Come on in. - It's cold. [sighs] So where's Esta? - She's upstairs, but I need to talk to you alone first. - What's up? - Come on. Online with all of her friends I had to upgrade my internet service because of her. - Oh, Lord. - For starters, I got the job! - Wait, what? I mean [laughing] that's great. When did that happen? - Oh, quickly. I saw the post online, applied on Monday, hired on Tuesday. How awesome is that? - It's awesome. I'm really happy for you. - Thank you. And I thought we might revisit the child support issue. - Come on, do we have to? I mean, I kinda thought we progressed, and, you know, it was moving in a positive direction. - Why? Because you hit me with a, "You can stay over if you want"? - No, I mean, you know, that was a spur of the moment thing, but also yeah, come on. - Oh. Anyway, I was thinking we might be at a point where we can handle things on our own. - Okay. - Maybe put the legal stuff on hold. Just keep your word about being there for her. - I'm always gonna be there for both of my ladies. [gentle music] Maybe now we can get in those gymnastic classes. - Yeah. - Yeah that'll make her happy. - She would love that. And for Christmas I was thinking you could spend it over here. - Really? - Yeah, with us. Dalton, I... I can honestly say that I miss you and I miss us. - Well, that's the best news that I've gotten in a long time. 'Cause I miss you. And I miss my family. - Then it's set. Wanna stay for dinner? - [Esta] Dad? Is that you? - Yeah, it's me, baby girl. Just let me know when it's ready. - I, I was thinking maybe we can hang out first alone. Yeah. He'll be up in a second. [lively jazzy music] - Thank you, Mom. Thank you, Dad, for one of the greatest gifts of my life. - You're welcome, sweetie. - Merry Christmas, Roz. - Merry Christmas, Dalton. - Merry Christmas. [bell ringing] [lively jazzy music continues] [upbeat holiday music] [upbeat jazzy music] [upbeat music] [upbeat holiday music] ["We Wish You a Merry Christmas"] [upbeat jazzy music]
