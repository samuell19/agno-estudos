How could a soldier steal royal treasures just because the country is ruined? Goryeo will not fall. If you are truly a loyal man, do not stand in my way. General. IN 1388, YI SEONG-GYE TURNED HIS ARMY AROUND IN WIHWADO GENERAL CHOE YEONG SENT HIS MEN BUT WERE DEFEATED THUS THE LAST PILLAR OF GORYEO FELL GORYEO GENERALS WHO FELT THE THREAT STOLE THE KINGDOM TREASURES AND FLED FAR OUT TO SEA I mean, I know that we're thieves... ...but why are we being pursued as traitors? Well... ...we did commit treason. What are you talking about? We'll be in the afterlife soon, so I'll be truthful. Do you remember the Samcheok tree? Of course. I made this spoon out of it. - This one? - I've never seen a tree like that. That was for the pillars of the new palace. The pillars? The new palace in Gyeongbokgung. The one Yi Seong-gye's building in Hanyang to make it to the capital? Yi Seong-gye searched all over the country to find wood for the pillars to support Gyeongbokgung and found that tree at the top of Taebaeksan. The one we stole in Gwangnaru? How'd it taste? Eating with the pillars of Gyeongbokgung? Good? The reason they stopped building Gyeongbokgung... It's all... because of this spoon. Why? Why did you do it? Probably not just to eat with it? Are the pillars of a thousand-year dynasty supposed to be a tree or the people? His vision never included what was right in front of his eyes. Really got on my nerves. So because it got on your nerves... You made thousands of soldiers chase after us. They're probably still after us. You're laughing? Dammit! Let me go! If I die, will my thirst die as well? I'll go a day early to save you all seats when I get there. I'll cut off your head! - Oh get off! - Let me go. Let me go! Let me go! So they've come, at last. They've come to take me. Are you a woman who lives in the land of the gods? How can someone be so beautiful? That I should have to die to meet my destiny. Here. Take me with you. Get up. Leave me alone. You're not getting up? THREE MONTHS AFTER THE RESCUE One. Two. Let me put on some clothes first. Captain, how long are we keeping these bandits on our ship? They're extremely lazy. They poop anywhere they like, the disgusting, dirty bastards. I have no idea what kind of ship this is. Is it a pirate ship? Are you pirates or fishermen? And if they're pirates, why only attack Japanese pirates? You must attack merchant ships for the money to feast on meat. We're like the Joseon navy, only attacking the Japanese. - Exactly! - Ugh. Getting sick just from looking at seafood. Ugh. Filthy. Who did that? Who threw precious food on the deck? She asked who threw food on the deck. Who? It was you. I've had it with these ungrateful bastards! - Get over here, you thieving scums! - Go on! - Thieving scum. - You did it. It was you. Go on. Hurry up. Come here. Now! Uh, I'm a pirate. - Never see you before. - This is my fifth day. - Dismissed! - Yes, sir. Something funny? Bandits, come here. Come here! - Come here! - Yeah. I didn't think so. Come here! Come here! Come here! - Come here! - Come here! Japanese pirates! Japanese pirates on the horizon! Japanese pirates on the horizon! Japanese pirate ship? Woohoo! Yeah! Hey! They look pretty rich for a Japanese pirate ship! Huh? We'll be eating meat soon enough. Captain, I'll cook you the world's most delicious steak. Let's slowly grill the beef over the fire. And we'll feast on boiled pork! Black clouds. Strong winds. It's perfect weather for sword-fighting. Black clouds and strong winds? Hey. Do you even know how to use a sword? Huh? Ah, you've heard of me. Up until now, I've only dried squid, but trust me, on the mainland, they call me Goryeo's Greatest Swordsman! I guess we'll see about that. Goryeo's Greatest Swordsman? Out of my way! All right! The time has finally come! Today, we bandits will stand on the frontline! You pirates stay here and prepare to feast on the meat! Mu-chi! Stop all your bragging and come down! Don't worry about me. And build the fire, my lady. I mean, Captain. Come on! Let's go! Full speed ahead! Come on! Come on! Perhaps it isn't a fishing boat? I'm sure it is a fishing boat. The best swordsman in Goryeo is coming! Hey, you bastards! And I suppose these are fishing rods? Pull! More! A bit more! Yes! Follow my lead! Go! Idiot. - Let's go! - Hold on! We don't need help from pirates! We do need help, Captain! Please, help us! - Lend me your sword. - Damn it. Help! Whoo. I'll have an easier time fighting without those guys getting in the way. Kill him! Amazing. Mu-chi! Let's see what you can do, Mu-chi. You're laughing? I'm holding a sword. Oh. Goryeo's Greatest Swordman. Amazing! Amazing! Truly amazing! Shut up! These waters belong to Joseon. Because you have plundered in our waters, I will be taking that plunder back. This is ours... Yours... Ours... We are sea-faring folk who follow the current. We make no distinction between our waters and your waters. Done? They say these are their waters too. What? That's a bit short. That's all, Captain. I lived on a Japanese pirate ship until I was ten. These are all your waters? All yours? You idiot. That's not what I said... Shut up! He's saying the entire sea is theirs! Captain. I looked everywhere, but there isn't any meat. There isn't even anything like chicken? Hey. I have no idea. All this crew eats is pickled fish. Please spare us! We're just... Shut up! We just came here in search of treasure. A huge stash of gold and silver... I'll kill you! What did he say? Oh. He... he says they're on a search for an enormous stash of treasure. Treasure? Boy, tell me. Where's this treasure? Where's the treasure? Me? This looks like the maps they use in Goryeo military camps. Yeah. It is. I used ones just like this. "Joo Bang." General Joo Bang, who led the Goryeo Imperial Guard? That Joo Bang? The one who swept up the treasure of the imperial family and disappeared? You mean this is General Joo Bang's treasure map? They said it's Joo Bang's treasure. We could eat meat! Quiet! Quiet. Why you little... How dare you tell us to be quiet! Captain, let's do it. If we get this treasure, we'll never have to look at another damn squid ever again. Oh, please, please. Huh? It's treasure. Treasure! - Please? - Huh? Okay! Let's raise our sails. Let's go! So I see the dragon's daughter is at a loss when it comes to being on land. Oh, here. Look, it's right here. Don't tell me you can't see it. Seriously... Come on! The dragon is master of the sea, but the tiger wins on land. Uh... Right! You'll follow me from now on! Let's go! Greet your guests! Goryeo's Greatest Swordsman, Wu Mu-chi, and his men have arrived! What was that? What was that? What? What the hell did he yell at? Over there! Over there! You saw it! A cow! Do you see it? A cow! Looks like the meat is coming to greet us first! Before finding the treasure, let's fill our bellies! Stop! Do not act out of line. Head to the tunnel! Come on! Cows! Cows! Cows! - No! Come back! - Turn around! No! Come back! Why? Get out of the way! Turn around! What's happening? Boss! Why? He was too full of himself... He died such a sudden death after living such a lowly life. Leaving behind only his spoon. Captain. We should go. Captain, look! Look! Look over there! How did he survive? Look who's back, huh? Here. Your hand. Kang-seop. Kang-seop. Now I understand why there's a tusk drawn on the map. This is the real treasure map. Let us return to the ship and feast. Yes, Captain. A treasure map. A treasure map. Why would you enter the cave when there's a herd of cows coming? I'm injured too. Honestly, unbelievable. I had a bad feeling about that cave. Who's making that damn whiny noise? You thieves, listen here! I said we're honest bandits. I took you in because I pitied how you all fled to sea after being branded as traitors to Goryeo. But I didn't think you'd stick around with us. Seeing how fat you've grown since then, I think the time has come to tell you. Are you telling us to leave? Listen! From this moment on, on my ship, only pirates can sail with us. Pirate! And if a bandit becomes a pirate? Then I'll accept him. Kang-seop, as you're second-in-command, I'll name you as first mate with A-gwi. Captain! Are we pirates now too? This will be good. Hey! Hey. Who said you could name him as your first mate, huh? Wu Mu-chi, I will... make you my quartermaster. You'll make me your underling? Wu Mu-chi, Goryeo's Greatest Swordsman? Just as the sea has only one Dragon King, a pirate crew can have only one captain. You're not just trying to play queen bee? Watch what you say, Quartermaster. Be careful. Don't call me quartermaster! Take a second to look at your bandits, Mu-chi! Every day is like a war, balanced on the line between life and death. You cannot lead a group if you confuse them with two different orders. You telling me to go? If that's what you want. Listen to me! I'm abandoning the ship and staying here. Look there! The path by sea is unclear. Who will walk the righteous path with me? It's fine. Stay seated. You're staying here with me anyway. Don't get sick. - I'm coming too. - Beats being a bandit. Let's go! Those who follow me are known as pirates from here on out. Take care. Is there really no one who will follow me? One, two. One, two. Those... Look at those disloyal morons, huh? Kang-seop, you stand for what a bandit should stand for. - For what is a bandit? Those united by... - Thank you for everything, boss. Take care of yourself and watch out for soldiers. You'd... Hang on, Kang-seop! - Come on, man. - Hurry up! - Wait for me! - Come on. It's you and me! Now, Wu Mu-chi... I said wait for me! Kang-seop. Stay here! Come back here! - Come back here! - Wait! One, two! Go on, then! Go! Good riddance! Good riddance! I'd heard that you killed the leader of Jurchen in Kuju. YI BANG-WON It appears that was true. The throne, you say? So you think I took command of a few hundred soldiers just to take the throne? You don't have enough men for that and, also, they seem unprepared. You are the real traitor. I appreciate it, you remembering that. Just come out with it. Prosperity. One does not claim the throne through rank but rather with power. You can have an army with wealth, and with an army comes power. I don't have wealth, I must admit. If I told you there was a hidden treasure, will you take it? Now this is a pirate ale! Hey. Give it here. The treasure is now within our hands! Well, I wonder if he ate anything. Shall I go and quietly bring him back here? If he wanted to come, he would have swum here already. I'm so full. Man... Captain! The elephant tusk is gone! What? What is gone? - The elephant tusk is gone! - Who did this? Who do you think did it? Ugh. That dirty, thieving bastard! I can't believe I ever called him boss. Dammit! Wu Mu-chi! Wu Mu-chi, I'm going to kill you if I ever catch you! Why do you think he left us his location? That idiot. Hold on. Is this a trap? A trap? I've known him a long time. He's not that cunning. Trust me. What is this growling? What else will growl like that? It has to be a tiger. A tiger? Run away! Rang? - Is this real, or a dream? - I'm going to kill you, you damn thief! - It would be nice if it weren't a dream. - I'm going to kill you! That hurt! Ow! - Get up! - Wait! Wait a moment! Why did you return? Did you miss me already? Are you proud of your thievery because you're originally a thief? Hey, Hae-rang. I told you I'm honest. All right, wait. Just wait. Listen to me. Who discovered the tusk? I discovered it, but you... You call it thievery. Yeah. I only have a couple things to say to you. Hmm. One, you should die for the crime of stealing from your brothers. I'm the one that found it. Two, simply return the tusk to me and I won't kill you. What an impressive threat. Did you forget? Greatest swordsman. - Even a crying tiger... - Please stop! Never say the "ger" in tiger in front of me again. Hey! Hey! Wait! Stop! You're really trying to kill me! Dammit! Give me the tusk. - I don't have it. - Really? Answer honestly and I'll tell you. Did you find me because of the tusk, or because you missed me? Mak-yi took it. Boss. The tusk? Thief! What, were you planning to find the treasure and keep it all to yourself? - Do I look that dishonorable? - Then what? Soon she'll come to find me and beg me on her knees. Who? Captain Hae-rang? So your plan is to use the tusk as leverage to get your position back as boss? Tell me, why bring a blanket if you're planning on going back anyway? I wasn't thinking straight. Now that we've sailed here together, our fates are linked, huh? There are soldiers in every direction here. - Soldiers? - Yeah. Since you know the mountains now, you climb to the peak first. To the peak? And if the coast is clear, strike your flint. Clack, clack twice. - Twice. - And I'll follow with the baggage. Mm-hmm. Right. - Right. - Right. - You're right. - Okay. Uh-uh. Leave this to your subordinate. Boss, you need to focus on the bigger stuff, not chores. You... Mak-yi, a subordinate? Upon my return, you're my quartermaster. - Yes, boss. - Yeah. How many strikes? - Twice. - Twice. Right. Go on, quickly. You got this. Go on, quickly! - Go. Go on. - Right. To the left. Chump. So naïve. That night, I kept striking the flint all night long. Idiot. Starting to feel like all you pirates are like that. No more self-pity. The rumor is spreading that Wu Mu-chi is selling the tusk. It has already spread even across the sea. Mak-yi, son of a... BYEOKRANDO - You can't go in there! - Out of my way! I'm so sorry, sir. He just burst his way in. I've come because I have a rare item. I am Wu Mu-chi, Goryeo's Greatest Swordsman. The one with Hae-rang? That Wu Mu-chi? I'm embarrassed that you know my humble history. After conquering the vast ocean, I cared for Hae-rang just like a sworn sister. Let me introduce. Who? Hae-rang. Who is? I am? Only 10,000 nyang. Only 10,000 nyang for an elephant tooth? It's what that legend is about. What legend? It was a day when lightning struck the Kingdom of Goryeo. Yi Seong-gye turned back his army from Wihwado. General Choe was defeated. There was no other choice. However, they say, even as the country was in ruin, there was a great general who made plans for the future. He took the gold from the Royal Treasury and Office of Internal Affairs. He wouldn't cede the kingdom to Yi Seong-gye. And using the treasure his military would rebuild Goryeo. W-what? I'm hearing this for the first time. Of course, you are. Everybody who knows the secret has died. You have before you the treasure map that leads to that royal treasure. The one that disappeared. Now you must show us your boldness that makes a mockery of 10,000 nyang. 10,000 nyang for an elephant tooth. You should take it. You will not regret it. Out of the way! You son of a... Kang-seop, damn you! What are you doing? What's going on? Oh, Captain. Damn it. What do I do? This bastard. How... How did you... You look so extravagant. Yes, yes. I was just about to take that... Yes? So this is, uh... Wait. So this must be the girl you said was your sworn sister. You said you couldn't stand her because she was too stubborn and hot-tempered. Captain, please... Please just kill me! That I will. And you are? Well, I'm the last princess of the Kingdom of Goryeo... Tie them up together! A princess? How dare you! Hey! Okay. You saw that? Untie me! - You're tying me up too? How dare you! - Wait. - Aren't you gonna untie me? - Pipe down! Everything we have, we earned with the blood of our brothers. But Wu Mu-chi broke and discarded that loyalty, and colluded with Mak-yi, who recently joined us. It wasn't c-collusion, I was kidnapped! Don't interrupt the captain while she's delivering her judgment! Say your last words! - My lady, as the last princess of Goryeo... - I'll judge you separately. - Such impudence. - Who is she anyway? Gom-chi. Gom-chi! Captain, don't! Please! Not only have I not married yet, I haven't even held a woman's hand! So... Gom-chi, Gom-chi, Gom-chi! I... I was born on a Japanese pirate ship and was abused for ten years just because I wasfrom Joseon. My mother and I fled together. Too bad you were captured by a slave-trader ship. I spent another ten years being abused there! And even lost my mother. Gom-chi... I'll go first! A true boss does not let the subordinate go first. Ooh. That's the first time you've said anything like a boss! I'll send you first. Come on! Whoo! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Come on. Everyone, stop! Especially you! Archer, don't you move! Lower your bow! I said lower your bow, dammit! Your captain promised me! She said she would spare me if I gave her the tusk! Didn't you? I did, but that tusk already belongs to us. Oh yeah? You sure? It's in my hands now. On the other hand, you want it in the Dragon King's hands. No! Stop! I'll let it go! I'll really drop it! Hmm. Give it. Hae-rang, Were you really gonna kill me? Hmm. Well, I knew you weren't going to die because you were hiding a knife. You saw that? I see a man who cries then laughs. Just as I thought, you're prettiest when you're being mean. Save me! Save me! Let's run away, boss. I can't live as a slave any longer. You'd be a quartermaster now if you hadn't betrayed me. - You should've struck the flint properly. - You! I struck the flint until I got blisters on my hands. You should've struck it until until the blisters burst! You... you shut your mouth! - Mister, they're messing around. - Get off me! Quartermaster, how do you know the Goryeo military way of cracking the code? I told you. I was the last warrior of the Kindgom of Goryeo. Dogs and cows claim to be the last warrior as well. If you gather all of them, you'd have a million soldiers. Dogs and cows? Get on with it! That's it. Let me see what's written. Dammit. It's a code. It's an old military cipher only used by Goryeo officers. Were you a private? Private Last Warrior? Private The Very Bottom. What have you found out? I searched for General Joo Bang, starting with those who died in battle from the Office of Internal Affairs. Three things disappeared that day. First was General Joo Bang. Second was the treasure of the imperial family of Goryeo And the last... ...was Joo Bang's wife. Of course, Joo Bang must have had someone backing him. Did you find his wife? She shaved her head... ...and became a Buddhist nun. Goodness. You must have searched every temple and hermitage in the country. What happened? Did she tell you where the treasure is? So, where... is it? "Haegildo"? "A sea cave beneath a rock with no shadow." "Haegildo"? Isn't that the p-perilous sea route? The sea is the sea, however perilous it is. - You don't know anything about it. - There's treasure? The... the water goes... Hey! Since you've lived trapped on that cramped land, you don't know anything. The whirlpools there, they keep swirling, and... A river flows under the ocean! Poop is poop and farts are farts. How can a river flow under the sea? I'm telling you it flows! Why you little... It flows! - It flows, it flows. - Forgive me. There's diarrhea too. The problem is that we don't know how long the river is. In other words, no one's gone under and come out the other end. Well, then I'm not going. I give up. I give up. Captain, let's not go. - First mate! - Yes? Bring the boat to shore and catch ten pigs. Yes. Raise the sails! If what you're saying is true, it surely is an amazing amount of treasure. What do you want in return? Become the king of Joseon. Yah! And you? I want to be the king of Tamna. Enjoy your trip, Boss! Bye! Oh no. What is that whirpool, huh? Whoa! There's no way of knowing where the river under the sea ends. Do not let go of your pouch. Yah! Yah! You said we might die. Are you afraid? Someone so afraid shouldn't be a leader. Uh... A leader who's afraid can find a way for us all to survive together. We're risking our lives to survive together. Yeah. Sure. Captain, our boat will be swept away if we go any closer to it. We'll ride the current from here! - Let's go! - Yes, Captain! - Ugh. What's this smell? - Go on! They're the pigs bladders that you washed so earnestly. They're filled with air. - I thought it smelled like piss. - I didn't wash mine thoroughly. I'm so scared, mister. No, don't! You go first. I can't make it. Hurry up and go, you bastard! Don't worry! I'll take care of the boat! Have a safe trip! Get up. Clench your teeth. Mak-yi? That stinks! Captain, it's not here either. Really? Just where is the treasure. I mean, really. Captain! There isn't another path! It's completely blocked off! Look harder! Captain, what's next? This is why I wanted to sell the map, in case this happened. I thought Hae-rang would be different, but she's just the same as those fools getting tricked by a fake map. - It's not here either? - Ugh. I'm hungry! Hey. It's not there either? Hey. Gather around. Get over here, quickly! He said gather around. I'm saying it because it came up. If we had sold the map, where would we be? - Shut up! - I'm not wrong. What should we do? Should we check again? Okay, okay, okay. What are you gonna do? They're all waiting for your next order. You risked our lives bringing us here, hmm? Whether you give them despair or hope, the leader needs to take responsibility. Hey, Hae-rang. A leader must... must use their brain. Yeah? Huh? Did he...? How dare you touch the captain's head! - Watch closely. - You bastard! What? What the hell is that? How will he kill him? Now you're a goner. You still think you're the boss. Too bad you don't have your sword. Never in my life have I lost a fistfight. Neither have I. Gom-chi! Such imeciles. I discovered this path that was blocked by a stalactite. Captain, please go ahead. Hey. You upset? You all right? Whoo! Captain. What? You could by 100 rolls of silk with just one of these. - It's enough to build ten palaces! - I know! Move. - Hmm? - Out of the way. He's acting all haughty again. I'm a bit disappointed. Why? I'm happy with it. Why are there only silver bottles? The royal treasure should have gold pieces. Gold pieces? A box of these silver bottles would be worth... one piece of gold. How many gold pieces should there be? About this big and this much. This much. This... It's said that it filled up the entire Royal Treasury of Goryeo's palace. We must find the gold! Find the gold pieces! - Hurry! - Over there! You aren't lying, are you? I'm honorable. I'm Wu Mu-chi. What is this? This isn't a flag they use in military camps. At first glance, it looks like the face of a goblin, but when you look at it up close... When you look at it up close? I have no idea. Get out of the way. It's an earthquake! Captain, it's an earthquake! A-gwi, Gom-chi, go back to the boat and bring more rope. Yes, captain. Gom-chi, hurry! Follow me! Everyone, get back! Someone's here. Halt. Yes, sir. - Huh? - Help move these. Wait. Isn't this a... a sea chart? What? A map? Joseon, Japan. And h-here is Inazuma Island. Inazu... w-what... zuma? Run back to the pond! Hurry up! Come on, quickly! - What about the captain? - Still in the cave. What the... - You okay? - Ah, it hurts, dammit! Captain! Captain! Get the captain out of here! Get them! Wu Mu-chi. You bandit scum! Officer Bu Heung-su of Tamna. Reporting the successful decapitation of the enemy general. Prepare for battle! We attack them at nightfall. Reporting! I have a direct order! Evacuate the wounded and make camp. The enemy line is closeby. We ambush them tonight and... It's an order! Evacuate the wounded first and make camp... Deliver the message that we have no wounded. There are only two kinds of men in my unit. Fighting or dead. You marched on after killing the wounded? Isn't that how war is? You killed your own men with your own hands? In exchange, I offer the general's head. His Majesty promised to make you king of Tamna if you brought him the enemy's head, correct? What of it? I won't allow a man like you to become king. You'll be punished according to military law. Arrest and bind him, now! Yes, sir! You dirty thief. You'll kill me and take credit for my success? - Lower your sword. - I don't intend to hand the credit to you! Again a mistake. So you need treasure, do you? Watch out! Another one goes in for each step you take. Will you steal what is mine, you aging thief? If you still covet what is out of your reach. If not for you and your men, I would've already been a king. A king? How can someone who's lower than a beast be a king? You can go to hell! Whoa, whoa! The treasure! Whoa! Captain! Sorry. Why aren't they coming up? Do you think something happened to the captain? I better go down there. The rope! - Come on! - Get them up! Pull! Captain! Boss! Thank you, Captain. Farewell, Boss. She's gone to a better place. Where did the sea chart go? Where's the captain? Where's the captain? Huh? Whoa! Not that way! This way, this way! Wait, wait! What about the silver? - The whale! The whale! - Whale? No! Not this! Give us the treasure! What's that, Captain? It was a sea chart. I thought I should sort some of your things. Seems like you're stealing as well. I'm not stealing them, I was just sorting them out. These just got all tangled together. How are you feeling, Captain? Thanks to you my head hurts now. These clothes are really quite pretty, but strange. There are a lot of unusual things in western seas. I'm the only woman on board, so everything I've gathered is piled up in the storage. You can wear whatever you want. Then please get some rest. The things hanging from my belt, they were inherited from brothers who've already died. They are my prized possessions. Oh dear. Oh crap. They're yours. I pledge my loyalty... What loyalty? We find ourselves in the same situation. That's why we should be honest with each other. I hope you realize that you can depend on us. Don't struggle on your own. What does it matter between two thieving women? These just keep falling out of nowhere. What are you doing? The sun's up. Do-mi, you better stop drinking so much. You okay? What? Do you love treasure that much? You could've died out there. We all wanted it, Mu-chi. It's worth it, even if getting it means risking my life. What will you do with it once you have it? Stop it! You wouldn't understand. What would I not understand? We're a big family out here on the ocean. But the ship isn't the only place where family is. We have family elsewhere. The family of those who've died before us, and more family to come in the future. Right now... there's nothing I can do for those people. Is that your responsibility as captain? That's some... pain in the neck. I want to know! Why did you think the treasure would be gold pieces? If the tusk is right and it's supposed to be enough to rebuild Goryeo, it would be all the gold pieces in the Royal Treasury. - Gold pieces? - And what about that goblin flag? It's back in the cave. Turn around. We're going back to the cave to get the flag. - What? - Huh? That flag is an inverted sea chart. A sea chart? It might be a map to the treasure, to the Royal Treasury's gold. Turn the ship around! Turn the ship around! No. No! No, no, no, no, no, no. - No? - No? There's no need to go back. - What are you doing? - Just hand it over. - Hand what over? - You have it, the goblin flag. What was that? I don't. - What? Hey! - You... Where did you hide it? - Wait a minute! - Where did you hide it? Fine! The treasure... Search him! Come here, you! - Strip off all his clothes. - I lost it! Just kill me instead! You must be having a rough time, huh? Captain, please. - You poor thing. - It's been so hard. Blow. Have some heart. How could you be so cruel to Mak-yi? Make it stop. End this cruelty. So cruel. The goblin map. You saw it, right? Did you happen to see any of the markings? Yes. The location? The island of Inazuma. What "ma"? In our language, it's, um, "Beongaesum." - Beongaesum? - Beongaes... Hey. Wait. The Beongaesum from the stories? Are you joking? Storm clouds rain down lightning there 1,000 times a day. Every time it comes down, it's ten years' worth of lightning in one go, like pop, pop, pop! Ten years worth? Bullshit! Hey. It's true, okay? Where is it, then? I've only heard of it. I've never been there. Never been there? - You little... - He's not lying. Oh. So you've been there, Captain? Sometimes, the whole sky fills up with lightning as far as the eye can see. It sounds like quite the spectacle. I've never actually seen it either. It had to be Beongaesum. Swirling winds rip the sails, the lightning snaps the mast. It's a living hell among hells. And who told you that? Despite how I look, I'm a man of the oceans. I was born on a pirate ship, traveling the oceans since suckling my mother's breast. Hang on. That means you know the way? Jeez... This is ridiculous. Woohoo! What is that big, bad boy? That's the Fire Dragon Cannon that the Emperor Hongwu bestowed upon King Gongmin to suppress the Japanese pirates. Weren't we after treasure? There's more than just Japanese pirates. Yeah. Those other pirate bastards. Captain, if I may, I'm gonna give this bad boy a try. Me too! Do you like killing that much? Isn't that the joy of life? Out of the way. Out of the way! Get out! With a blanket of dark clouds, the entire sky is filled with lightning, like zap, zap, zap, zap, zap. So where is this exactly, huh? Will you quit interrupting? We'll be up all night at this rate. - This bastard! - Whoa! Captain! Stop cutting him off! Okay. Where was I? Anyway, we can't go there. We'll definitely die if we do. Okay, I understand. So why don't you just tell us just the location. All right? - Hmm? - I told you we'll all die. You're a good boy. Right, Mak-yi? We won't go. So tell me, where is it? If you're not going, why do you need the location? This bastard! - Give me a sword. I'll just kill him now. - Here, Captain. Let's not go there, Captain. Those waters sound too dangerous to cross with mere courage. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. To be afraid of the sea, of all places, you can't call yourself a pirate. Can you? He's a fisherman. We are pirates, and the open sea is our domain! The gold is waiting for us! No one can stop us, not even ourselves! To find the treasure! Let's go! If you guide us to Bongaesum, you can keep a tenth of the treasure there. Why would we give it to him? Give it to me now, while I'm still alive. If I'm dead, what good is gold? Is there something else? There's nothing here worth exchanging your life for? Well, it's not that there isn't anything I want. It's not like you're going to give it to me, so... What is it, then? It's... I can't bring myself to say it. What is it? Say it! - Only I know how to get there. - Yes, indeed. - Only I have been there. - We know, we know. With that in mind... See... I got it! You want to become the captain. What? It's unfair for me to die after being treated like this. So just at least until we find the treasure, Pirate King. Are you mad? Do you want a swift death? Put it down. Shouldn't the captain decide? Well? Ah. As a captain you can risk your life, but you can't give up your authority, huh? I'll ask everyone! You can choose one or the other. Shall we go find the treasure after fulfilling Mak-yi's request? Or shall we kill him right now to maintain order? Those of you who want the treasure raise your hand. Come on, Captain. You need to close your eyes. Mother, I am the Pirate King. Let me greet the Dragon King! I am the new... Pirate King, Mak-yi! Captain, uh, leave this kind of chore to your subordinates. All right? Think of it as a vacation for a few days, and take a break. Dammit! The captain is the one manning the helm, of course. So just call me Rang, the quartermaster. Come on, Captain! It's almost dinnertime. Off you go! I mean, how could we possibly do anything when you're down here working, Captain? Get out, dammit! Please. Okay, okay, Rang. - Rang? Did you say Rang? - Come on. She seems upset. Big time. She's sensitive about the situation even though it's only for a few days. Even if it's only for a few days, they're all blinded by the gold. Dammit! I'll kill the ones who raised their hands! - Why are you hitting me? - You kept your eyes open. Chin up, yeah? Rang. As far as I'm concerned, I really felt relieved. How about you? Hey. Money is the real boss these days, you know? You just lost against gold. How do you win against gold, hmm? Don't mind it too much. Tread carefully. It's not about the position. I was willing to give it up if there was anyone worthy. Worthy how? Captain Mak-yi, time to eat! - Who am I? - The new captain. New captain, sir. From now on, no fishy food on my plate. Bring me a cooked chicken and rice wine. Hey, captain? Halfmoon Island is on the right. Didn't you say to make a left here? You're a moron. Why didn't you tell me when you saw it? But I just got up here. Why couldn't you get up there sooner? Because someone was standing up here until now, acting all cool and showing off. Don't give him any food. Even old squid is wasted on that fool. No food for you. Eat that! - Jerk. - Hey. Wipe here. That's enough. Get lost. - Hey, Witless. - Yeah? Go up there too. Isn't one person enough? You can't really see once the sun sets anyway. - We need to have dinner, Captain. - I'm hungry. You'll eat your dinner up there with that other moron! How could he change that much? It's pissing me off. - What are you muttering about? - I didn't say anything. Yeah! You are incredible! Hey. How did you... did you make sardines taste like this? Not all sardines are the same. Ocean flavors, if you know them, you can draw the real flavor like this. Wow! I knew you had good cooking skills. But I never expected it to be this good. Seriously! Mmm! Hey. The Captain should not be cooking! She's better as a captain than a chef! I finished it! All of it! Take your time eating. I'll make it often from now on. Huh? Mmm! I'm telling you it's very serious I can't sleep. Come over here. Take a look at this. The legs of the bed are all bro... ken. All fixed now. Good. Excuse me. - Why would you fix the bed, Rang? - Why not me? Do you have any idea how hard it was to break all of those? Huh? Seriously... I mean, why did you... I'm sorry. It's okay. Could you help me out and let me borrow that red stuff? The thing you put on your lips. I have no such thing. You know. Come on. When you're around Mu-chi in the kitchen, and you put it on to... Rang, are you there? Did you ask me here to see this? You like it? I forgot the night sky was always so beautiful. What did you put in your hair? My hair? Uh, it's oily from not washing it. Who the hell was it? Who touched my sesame oil? They're looking for you. Rang, what do you know of love? That's personal. Huh? What are you talking about, personal? Love means something different for everyone. Just like waves of different sizes. Then is love you give to courtesans a big wave or a small wave? - I only drank there. - Yeah. Sure. I only drank. I swear. Your quartermaster, Kang-seop... I don't recall asking about that. Really, I only drank. - Kang-seop... - I'm going back down. Rang. Rang, wait. Take a look at this. Rang. "Meaning is as deep as the sea, but courage is hidden in the dark. Pass by the flash of light and find the light of the truth." What does it mean, captain? We have to solve this riddle in order to find the treasure. Impaling the head on a spike is a punishment usually reserved for traitors. Do you know who these 12 men are, captain? The sea is boiling! What? The sea is boiling? What's that? Dark clouds will roll in soon. We must fold the sails, now. Fold the sails! Fold the sails! Not yet! - Don't do it yet. - Not until I say so. If we mistime it, we'll be swept into the Sea of Fire! Trust me, Captain. Do tell. How does the former captain not know Bongaesum, but knows the Sea of Fire? I was swept into it by a rainstorm when I was young. And this rising haze looks just like it did then. The Sea of Fire appears after passing Bongaesum. Even a ghost would die there, but you survived? I wouldn't be standing here if I hadn't. I've heard that hundreds of thousands of dragons live in the Sea of Fire, so... You've seen a dragon? When you see it for real, it's not dragons, but huge pillars of fire. Hundreds and thousands of pillars of fire piercing the sea and surging into the sky! The black clouds are rolling in! We must hurry and fold the sails. If we lose the sails, we lose everything! I just said not yet! I know the way. Huh? Everyone out of the way! Lightning! Quickly fold the sails and batten down the hatches! Fold the sails! Get out! Keep your heads down! We're all gonna die! Captain! Captain Mak-yi, take the wheel! You know the way! Captain Mak-yi! The wheel is spinning by itself! Captain Mak-yi, go quickly! We'll all die up here! Get below deck! Go down! Go down! If the boat fills with water, you'll all die! Don't go below deck! Get back up! Get back up! Tie yourself with rope. Captain Mak-yi, give the order! Do that! Do that! If the ship wrecks, you won't be able to escape! Don't tie yourself! Just hold on! Hold on! Everyone, follow Rang's orders! If you just keep your mouth shut it'd be fine Wu Mu-chi! That's what they're for, captain? As expected of our captain! Hold on tight! Help me! Quickly fold the sails and batten down the hatches! Quickly! Go! This isn't ten years' worth of lightning! It's like 10,000 years'! Pull yourself together! Grab my neck. Not like that. - Help! - Save us! Ah, shit! What? This is it! We're finally here! Save us! We're over here! Save us! After the first lightning strike, you get out of the way? Your first storm, huh? He was the first to run away, dammit! - Get off! - You're all idiots! Captain Mak-yi, where's the treasure? We have to find it. We don't have the map. What? It's a small island. If we dig around, we'll stumble across it. Small? You call this small? I ought to kill this fool. What? Why are you all staring at me, huh? You're the leader. When did you treat me like one? Not one of you ever followed my orders, dammit! You all talk behind my back, then put me on the spot when things got dangerous? It's like being a damn slave! That's what being a leader is. You didn't know? He's right. That's insane. Right. Just a moment. - He remembers. - What is it? I quit being the leader. I'll crush his head! I'm serious! Bongaesum ahoy! Where? Let go of me! Let go! I'm walking! Boss, this is the land, not the ocean. The dragon is master at sea, but the tiger is on land. So, now I, Mak-yi, the Pirate King... ...will follow your orders. I've been away at sea too long, Captain. Quartermaster, you dare to lead the way when Captain Mak-yi, who knows the way, is behind you? Come here, Captain Mak-yi, in three, two... It's over there. Looking for something? A stream of water. You sure are a natural leader. Joo Bang would have done the same. Hurry! These folks sure rest peacefully here. This is why no one's seen Joo Bang since he disappeared. By the way, did you solve the riddle, Captain? "Meaning is as deep as the sea, courage is hidden in the dark. Pass by the flash of light and find the light of the truth." There's nothing here. If you're not gonna trust me, stop digging! The lightning is striking the same place. Now! - Hmm. - See? It strikes the same place over and over. Just when you think it's done, it... There! Right now. Whoa. Is there something there? - It seems like it. - But what? - Shall we see? - Shall we? Don't dig there. Dig right here. Should we dig more? - Dig more. - More? Just a little bit more. Ugh. Dammit. Wow. Look at all you've dug! These morons just keep digging because I told them to? Something's here! He found something. Let's bury him here when he comes over. - Alive? - Hey. You... you've found something? - Treasure. - Get that son of a bitch! Get that bastard, dammit! I'll go on my own. Gold is truly amazing. Hmm? I've never seen you doing something without someone ordering you to. It's because you want it. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be here. Or stayed on that damned sea at all. The first time I saw you, I thought you were the angel of death coming for my soul. My heart fluttered thinking of a death with you. I was happy to be dying. Eat this if you're hungry. Wow! This, uh... Delicious. Hmm. Mmm. Thanks so much. Don't mention it. "Traitors." We've come to the right place. Yi Seong-gye. Jeong Do-jeon. And that's Left State Counselor Cho Min-su. All the founders of Joseon are all gathered here. Those were the twelve traitors of Goryeo. Pull out the spear of the one that served his majesty and dig underneath it. Go pull out the spear! Now! Move faster! I said move it! Go! Pull the spear out, now! Pull out the spear, now! There will be a greater reward for those who show courage! You heard him! Pull out the spear! Get a move on! Hurry! If you run, you're dead! - A trap? - It's a trap! Get back! Choe Yeong. YEONG The last general of Goryeo who fought against Yi Seong-ye. That's General Choe Yeong's flag. Choe Yeong. Goryeo's last general surrounded by the founders of Joseon. That's the one. Captain, the apparatus! The apparatus! It worked! Of course, that's the one. What are you? A bird or a fish? What? Gold! Unbelievable! There really is gold here. Mak-yi, you ass! I can't believe you. If I find you, I'll tear off your head! I found it! I found the gold! He found it? Where? Over here, you jerks! - I found it! - Where's the gold, Captain Mak-yi? - There. - Where is it? You found it? Where is it? That little... You better get back here! Enough. Who are you talking to? First mate... ...it was like a bird that looks like a man. Or a man that looks like a bird-fish thing. This creature had a huge piece of gold in it's mouth. He was right here, like this. I call bullshit! The last straw. - Kill him! - I'm tired of this! That lying mouth! - What is that? - What is that? Gold. Did you see? Did you see? Do you believe me? Do you believe me? Then hurry up and find it. The gold is waiting here for us! If you can't take it from here, you're not worthy to be a pirate! Let alone a jellyfish! Yeah! - Find it! - Find it! Where did you get it? Say something already! Are you asking the bird? Bird? You still don't get it? Here. Give me that. Watch this. You saw that, right? You saw that? When have we ever seen an animal that wants gold? Have you? Have you? - No. - I haven't neither. You might fool the others, but you can't fool a former merchant. Are you saying that is actually a person? Ugh. This is so damn frustrating! Come on. Say something while we're still being nice. Where did you get that gold, huh? I'm being nice. Do you have to bleed to start flapping that beak? I've never seen someone as stupid as you are. Forgive him, birdie. I, Captain Mak-yi, apologize for this rotten bastard crewmember. Could you tell us where your leader is? What is that? It's a cannon. Captain, the government ship. The ship's here. Fire! Huh? We found it! We found it! Pull it up. Hurry! It actually exists. Pull it up! Yeah! The little rat. Wu Mu-chi. You've done a good job finding a treasure that belongs to someone else. And who is that? Me. Leave it to us to cut off that crazy bastard's head! Don't stop now! Fire! What do we do? Captain? Listen up. Whether you die fighting with me today, or turn your back and live in regret for abandoning us, the choice of where you die is yours to make. But I promise you as a captain, I have no intention of dying on this island. And I won't let any of you die on this god-forsaken island either. Captain, I will stay with you! Me too! Me too! Captain, we must stay together from now on. You live life only once. Let's have our way with gold and welcome our fate! Yeah! Let's take down the government ship! And find the treasure too! Okay! Let's take the government ship now! Quartermaster, go rescue your boss. Draw the enemy's attention until we take the ship. As former bandits, we're good on land. Let's climb that mountain, find our boss, and have a long overdue reunion! - Let's go have some fun! - Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! - Let's go! - Let's go! Out of the way, man. You're blocking us. Let's go! Forward! I thought I was captain. Let's go too. To find the damn gold! Hae-geum! - Where's the treasure? - All that's here are rocks! - Find it! - Captain! Catch him! Get him! "Entrance"? There's another entrance? Where are you going? Huh? What are you doing? Let's get going! Just come here! Let's go! Our teamwork is terrible, seriously! Bu Heung-su! Do you need this goblin mask? Seems like it's the final key to find the treasure. If you hand it over now, I'll spare your life. You probably don't even have a ship to carry the treasure, anyway. Ship? But I only need one ship. If you're not a coward, me against you. Let's duel for the treasure. Just don't run away. - Huh? - Oh. Stop! This is a leader's duel. Can we go a little faster, please? Dragons. The dragons are awakening! You've been tricking me all along! You bastard! You'd better run, you turd! I'll rip your legs off if I catch you! Got you! Get him! Why have you been trying to pick that up? Just focus on fighting! What? What's this? Huh? It's the same. I have no excuses, Captain. We're alive? We're alive? And Hae-geum? There's pirates! - Prepare to die! - You're all dead, dammit! Lose some weight. I found the treasure! Whoo! I found the treasure! I found the... Wait. So... Ah, shit. Birdies, just listen to me. I'm not saying I'm going to keep this all for myself. I'm saying, first, let's get off this island, huh? Then we divide it evenly. You should know I have an enormous number of subordinates, okay? If I get caught here dillydallying... It's... it's a waste of my... Ow! How dare you! You're pushing your luck! I'm the Pirate King... Huh? Captain, the ship, it's in terrible condition! We have to stop fighting and repair it immediately! We must repair the ship. If this ship sinks, we'll all die! You're about to die, anyway. So why do you care? I've returned. I'm here to save you all! It is I, Mak-yi, the Pirate King! Throw away your sword! Hold on tight. - Hold on tight. - What's happening? Is a phoenix taking off this time or something? Get down quickly! Hey. You okay? Why do I see two ships? You too? Yeah, but what's that sparkly thing? Did Joo Bang's ship survive? Is that all gold in that ship? Well, look at that. That's enough to build a new kingdom. Gold! Kill them all. Kill them all! Everybody, cross over! Captain! - Shoot at them! - Hurry, Captain! Fire! Captain! Let's go! - Captain! - No! Captain! I got you! Captain! Captain! - Hey, hey. Don't touch there. - It hurts! God. I almost died. The captain's okay! Yeah! I'm still the captain! It's starting again. After a battle against countless dragons in a sea cave, I brought these treasures. How many dragons were there? 3,873. Now that we have the treasure, it's time to go home! Let's go home! What's that sound? What was that? A horde of dragons has awakened. Raise the sails! Captain! When I give the signal, be sure to secure the sails! Yes, Captain! Everyone, get ready! Pull yourself together, men! Now pull! Pull! Someone help me! Are we alive? This must be the afterlife. We're alive! We're alive! We're alive! We're alive! So you made it, Captain! 'Cause it's my turn now! Don't die on me, Wu Mu-chi. If I die on this mountain, will Rang remember me? I wonder. In the end, the strongest always wins. Wu Mu-chi! - Boss! - Kang-seop! Wu Mu-chi succeeded as well. Look at this! I found the treasure! Huh? Hae-geum. Is she alive? Hey. Did you eat yet? I wonder what happened to Joo Bang. He wouldn't have been able to leave the island without a boat. He's probably asleep on the island somewhere, full of sorrow for his ruined country. What ruined country? Goryeo's been rebuilt. Joseon's it's name, now. A country is its people, the pillars of a thousand-year dynasty. So now that we found the treasure, um... ...what's Boss going to do? Boss? Well, if you insist on staying on the ship, I'll have to rethink the leadership then. - What do you say? - I need to think it over. How long are you going to think about it? Your vacation is over... Captain. Attention! Are you really leaving us? Do I have any other choice? You cannot have two dragons on one ship. If it is our fate, I suppose we will meet again. As long as you're still on the sea, Captain. But I'm confused. Where's the island here? I asked to be taken to a safe island. The island is over there. Where? That island. That's not an island, it's a rock. We paid particular attention to the safety you mentioned. There are no mountain beasts or wild animals. What's more, no soldiers either. Exactly! I assure you there's no safer place. He's right! When there's no fresh water, or room to stretch your legs! There is no place in this world that is perfect. Exactly! Joo Bang, rest in peace. 'Cause we are honest bandits. we'll use it well to help the common folk. So you didn't answer my question. Hmm? Ah. Oh, Hae-rang. - Hmm? - Hey. Just stay still, will you? What? My answer. Are you saying you'll stay? The former Greatest Swordsman chooses to walk alongside you. Idiot. For me to know, you have to do this. Captain? Huh? What? Since when were those two... You didn't know? While they were cutting fish heads. What's going on? Them too? What's the use of treasure, dammit? Ugh. I don't need any of this. Please, stop already! Stop! Come on!
