I mean all of us, we have a big smile on our face. That's, uh, that's a good thing about it. When you do a race weekend in Formula 1, you be always so serious, so concentrated that it doesn't leave much space to see who is the person behind. And in those events, everything is a little bit more easy. And you should see a little bit more about the personal side. COULTHARD: What I've always done in explaining to people what Race Of Champions is, is that they can see up close and personal why we love competition, why we love getting behind the wheel of a car. It doesn't have to be a race car, It can be any form of car, whether it's the buggies or the KTM's. And it's just pure competition. -It's tough, you know. It's a quick shootout. It can be one way or the other, but so far I feel good. So, let's see. You know, the fans are ready. So, I did need to do my bit, to make sure I survive the group stage and then we see where we go.

It's fantastic to see Filipe Albuquerque coming from so far, ending up beating the world - Formula 1 World Champion and the World Rally Champion in the same night. It's proper racing. COULTHARD: Any loss is not good, but the reality is if you look at the most successful driver in Formula 1, Michael Schumacher, he lost more than he won.

I mean, nobody wants to look bad. My off-road background certainly helped, but I did feel like I struggled pretty bad driving in the Canaries because the vehicles we were in for ROC were four-wheel drive and everything I raced was two-wheel drive. But there was a big high speed left-hander at the bottom of the course and I came in, in my instinctive flick for a two-wheel drive vehicle and then counter-steer to catch it, jump on the gas; I did all of that. And with four-wheel drive, you know the front tires pull you where they're pointed and with the counter-steer that I put into it, the car went right and there was an opening cut in this big dirt berm and I stuffed it right in that opening. I felt so bad, but that's the only - honestly, the only time I've ever raced a four-wheel drive. -You spotted any potential placs where you might be able to get an advantage here? -I've spotted plenty of opportunities to get in trouble.

He was fearless; he was trying to drive the car like he would drive the Sim car and it doesn't work like that in real life. So actually when Enzo did beat Lucas on the track, I felt extremely proud that he's come through the process. Now, he's very, very fast and that just shows that they proved it: They can get in a real car, they can learn the craft and actually be very, very quick and beat some extremely good, quick, fast pro drivers. ♪♪ COULTHARD: It's no big surprise to me to see how successful some of the eGamers have become, not only as professionals in their own fields, but also in the crossover to full-time motor sport. GRANT: They totally changed. They listen, they learn, they take information, they process it, and then turn it into real life action. So honestly, I feel quite proud on the journey that they've had. They're representing the whole community from eRacers. This is a massive achievement for them, massive. -They go from these scared kids, "Oh no, I'm going to get in this car and die." To actually jump out the car at the end and they're like, "Oh wow, That was brilliant." LEIGH: When I was a kid, I wouldn't even want to go to answer the door to someone; I was that shy. And then being put on a plane, come to the event, drive some real cars, meet some famous people. And to be around racing drivers who are very, very successful and to pick up little bits of knowledge what they've done in their life and I can start implementing it into my career, really gave me a lot of self-confidence. And since then I started to grow as a person. I think that information for me is unbeatable. ♪[dramatic rising music] ANNOUNCER: A new line-up for team Germany as Mick Schumacher joins his father's old teammate, Sebastian Vettel. -I'm really looking forward to Race Of Champions. We will come out on top with Sebastian. And yeah I'm just really, really thrilled for it. COULTHARD: It's emotional to see Mick representing team Germany, given the difficulties that the family has gone through, and the difficulties that Michael has gone through, but we hope that we can see Michael there watching Mick compete and get some victories in the future. JOHNSON: Win, lose, or draw, the experience of ROC is unlike anything else. KRISTENSEN: It's always within a tiny little fraction of either winning or losing. VETTEL: At least one of us will get defeated. PRIAULX: There's only one winned anybody can lose around here. KRISTENSEN: If any time you thik that you have the upper-hand, you're not going to win. JOHNSON: There's always risks wn you put it on the line. COULTHARD: The very nature of the competition means that you race absolutely to the line. Because in normal competition, you can keep your competitor behind you, but the fact that you're on your own track, you never truly know whether you've won or lost until you cross the line. ♪[music swells] ♪♪
