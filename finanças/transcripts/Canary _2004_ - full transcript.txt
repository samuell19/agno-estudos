So, please Chant the mantra with all your heart "Your mother was a total failure as a human being" That's what Grandpa said, at the Child Welfare Center So I lunged at him, and tried to strangle him While I was doing that... I thought I had every reason to kill him Tama Zoo This the street? Hey, wait There may be cops I'll go scope it out IWASE Apologize! Death Penalty Parents are Culpable Hey, what are we going to do, now. Find Asako And just how are we going to do that? Huh? Wander all over Tokyo without any money? According to testimony by former members, the three additional Nirvana suspects accused of three counts of murder and manslaughter, in addition to the subway terror attacks, are Nirvana's top leaders, Tsumura Yoshio, aka Junana, Tsuji Shoichl, aka Ronchenva, and Iwase Michiko, aka Lucia Concerned that these desperate fugitives may attempt further attacks, investigators have stepped up safety measures They are also planning additional raids on the dozens of Nirvana-affiliated sites throughout the nation Hey, Yuki I don't know what you're planning, but I'm against it What's wrong is wrong Yuki! All right Then, I'll steal Steal today, steal tomorrow, steal day and night, whenever you get hungry? Besides, if you steal you'll go to hell, won't you! Here's your lunch money What? Nothing Hey, hey, what the... Hey! What the! "Alone, alone, 'the never-ending trail, "is a long hard road 'but take heart "Every steep climb "leads to a descent 'Endlessly, endlessly "again tomorrow, "on the never-ending silvery trail" Ravana! Yoshioka! Ravana Koichi Shuropa Did you escape from Child Welfare? Cosmo Recycling OK... We're almost ready I'll help, too Where's grandma? Kimura san went to get her Koichi, I'm not Shuropa anymore I'm Izawa Akira That's true for all of us here We're all former believers, starting over together And Garusha? She stayed with the Order Koichi Do you hate me now? We'll get one of the old crowd to find out where your grandpa is Make yourself at home here, 'til then You, too, Yuki This is the Yuki I mentioned Oh, Yuki? Why, thank you Yuki... such small hands Thank you kindly Ready? - And up - we go OK, OK Thanks Hey, wait, Koichi OK? And up we go Be careful, you two Hey, don't overdo it No sweat Thanks That's it We're off Off you go Ready Off you go Koichi! I'll help you Like this... Thanks Izawa san planned to swindle his Dad out of this place and donate it to the Order Lock his father up and steal the deed from him... All so he could move out of the Children's Division to better work It makes sense All his younger recruits were promoted ahead of him Take that old woman... Her daughter donated all the family goods, so, essentially, she joined the Order because she was homeless What the hell... were we thinking? Yuki san, shall I make you some origami? Grandma... you can make origami? Sure, I can make you anything Grandma, can you make a flying bird? You mean a crane? Like a crane, but different Its wings make this flapping sound My Mom used to make them for me before she died Oh... Watch carefully, now, Yuki So? Grandma, let me try I'll go show Koichi Yes, hello... Where... are you now? Tsumura... Please call me Junana... Shuropa Junana Did you... really do it? Do what? You want to make me to say it? What difference would my answer make? You'll just implicate yourself In fact, you know very well If you place your question within the Master's teachings, the answer will reveal itself Isn't that true? At this time, I have absolutely nothing to fear The police will never be able to catch me It's impossible for them to catch me Because the Master protects you...? Because we are practitioners of the Truth Because we offered our very selves in quest of absolute Truth, beyond the logic of the material world Authority and society function on the basest, human level But we are different We are devoted to Laws of Truth, beyond the human world Even if such people managed to apprehend our physical bodies, they would never capture or imprison our souls That's absolutely impossible You can't believe a word of that. If you did, you wouldn't sit here and lecture me about it You don't believe it, you just want to believe it! Because unless you believe, you'll fall apart I know that all too well... Now, I do You're the one who's lecturing And you're the one who wants to believe... no? It was a mistake to come and see you I respected you for first showing me the way, out of my unenlightened ignorance What a shame Can I ask you one last thing? Yes Can you contact Lucia? What for? Lucia's son is staying with me His grandparents rejected him and he's adrift I want to help him I cannot contact Lucia I cannot contact anyone I understand Isn't there anything I can do? No Thank you It looks nice on her Oh... good I'm happy Koichi, your grandpa's address? Don't you lose that, now And... would you, Kimura san? It's not much, but it's a farewell gift from all of us here You can pay us back once you start making a living Thank you Koichi Koichi, what did Nirvana mean to you? For me, Nirvana was a dream It was my future I hoped that by practicing at Nirvana, I would transform myself beyond recognition, and then transform the world That's what I believed But... it was a colossal mistake Nirvana was just another reality... A reality exactly like this reality, just a different one... Shuropa I told you I'm not Shuropa anymore The Shuropa inside me is dead Koichi You're not a child of God Nor a child of Nirvana Koichi, You're you You, yourself You're not anything else And so you have to decide for yourself, exactly who you are That may prove to be a harsh undertaking You may not be able to stand just being yourself But Koichi, don't let that weight crush you Just like I'm only me, you can't buckle under the weight of just being yourself You don't have umbrellas, do you? When you go, just take one of those umbrellas They've been forgotten here... We interrupt our broadcast with this news flash Shortly after 2PM, in an apartment in the North District, 6 bodies of Nirvana members wanted for terrorism were discovered The bodies showed no external wounds, and authorities are investigating the possibility of a mass suicide The confirmed dead include, the Nirvana leader presumed responsible for a terrorist attack, suspect Tsumura Yoshio, aka Junana Koichi... Likewise, suspect Tsuji Shoichi, known as Ronchenva... suspect Iwase Michiko, known as Lucia, and Nishioka Masato! Koichi! Don't, Koichi! So what if your mom's dead! What'll happen to your sister if you die? What'll happen to that sister, who's waiting for you? I'll go get her for you And if I can't bring her, I'll die with you I 'On the long, long, "never-ending trail, "a winter storm "rages, but... 'It's springtime In the valley, "and flowers bloom "Alone, alone "another day alone, "on the never-ending silvery trail" "Alone, alone, 'the never-ending trail, "is a long hard road 'but take heart "Every steep climb "leads to a descent 'Endlessly, endlessly "again tomorrow, "on the never-ending silvery trail" Grandma Koichi's... he's doing just fine No point talking to her She can't hear a thing Who are you? I've come to take Asako to Koichi Otherwise, I'll have to die with him I see So, Koichi's still safe Your name? Yuki Yuki... how old? Twelve Michiko was twelve when she learned to swim Her mother and I took her to the sea... She was so timid I had to scold her, but... she learned how to swim You mean, Koichi's Mom? This morning, Michiko called She demanded I put Koichi on the phone, saying he must be here I told her, I had refused to take him She went silent for a while, and then said in a tiny voice, "I couldn't "save your soul, father" That's all she said, and then she killed herself I can't let Koichi have Asako Why not? I'm starting over with Asako I won't screw it up with her I'll never screw up like that again How dare you You tear Koichi and Asako apart How dare you? That's a huge screw up already. Koichi and Michiko are the same It just won't do What the hell is that? That's no... That's no reason. Why is that? Kids... we can't choose our parents. Can parents choose their kids? I... I finally get it You're just like my father You're human scum! Koichi "I... "am... "He who... forgives all..." "What'll you do now?" "Go on living."
