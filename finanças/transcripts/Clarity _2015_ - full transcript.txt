- You know what? Just one second. - Hey. Can't you be excited for your sister? - I won't ruin Princess Maggie's day. - What did she ever do to you? - I took my earphones off alright? Leave me alone. - Maggie's home. - Alright shh! Wait wait. Shhh. - Mom? Guys? In here Maggie. Surprise! - Dr. Jameson. - Thank you everyone but I'm not a doctor yet. - Oh that doesn't matter to us. We're just so proud of you. - Speech, speech. - Speech! - Umm, I don't know how to, how to tell you guys how much I, how much, - Maggie! Oh my god. Maggie. Maggie honey. Mal, Malcolm do something. - Jason, call 911 right now. Maggie Maggie! Maggie listen to me Maggie! - Excuse me. Can you step outside for a moment? I don't know how to say this. - Just say it. Just tell me the truth. - She has Alport Syndrome. - What is that? - It's a disease of the kidney. It's hereditary. If left unchecked, it slowly deteriorates the kidney's function. It's quite rare. What's even more rare is how aggressively it's attacking Maggie. Does your family have a history of kidney disease? - No. No. That's irrelevant. Is she gonna be okay? - Well that depends. - On? - On getting a new kidney. From a perfect match. - Oh god. - You going to be alright? - Yeah thank you. - What happened? - She's dying. - Look at me mom. What's wrong with Maggie? - Her kidneys. - What about them? - They failed. - They both failed? How is that possible? - Maggie needs you. - What do you want me to do? - Find her family. - You alright? - What are you doing? - I don't know if this is the right path for you. - Now look we don't have time for this. Let me have the folder. I don't understand. What is this? - The truth. - It can't be. It can't be! It's as if she didn't exist. - What do you mean? - Life just goes on and if she dies in here, it's as if she didn't exist. When you and I die even the memory of her dies. - There are people who love her. - That's not what I mean. I don't know how this is going to end but I do know that we're doing what's best for Maggie. - Okay. Well once we start this, there's no going back. - Just bring her here. - And if she won't come? - Then she doesn't have to. We just need her kidney. - Hello sir, I'm Malcolm. - I know who you are. - I spoke with your Captain. - Come in. - Where's Carmen? - I wanted to meet with you first. What can we do for you? - I think you know why I'm here. - I know a lot about you Malcolm. I know who you are. I know where you come from and I know what you did. I just don't know what you want. - I need to speak to Carmen. Alone. - Well that's not going to happen. - You know why I came to you? Because it was the right thing to do. I don't think people like you know what the right thing even looks like. - Oh yeah? Well look around, because this is what it looks like. - I am looking around and you know what I see? I see a person in a place where he has no power. This is Mexico. We don't live our lives by your rules. - You're right. Sorry to have wasted your time. - So that's it? - Oh, no sir. I have a deadline to keep and I will keep it. I will speak with her. I thought maybe I would get your help but I don't have time for this so perhaps your captain can help me. - If you go near her, - What will you do? What will you do huh? 'Cause I know things too Omar. I know that you have three kids. I know their names. I know what school they go to. - If you even think about, - Oh but I am thinking about it and I will do it. You know I will. I mean you said so yourself. People like me are capable of anything. - Wait. I'll bring her. - Carmen. - Gracias. - Hello Carmen. - Pleasure to meet you. - So what is it you want? - I want Carmen to meet her daughter. - She's beautiful. Yes. - She's a woman. - What do you want from us? - Maggie, Claridad she's sick. And her mother wants you to come to meet her right away. - Is it serious? - Yes, she's dying. - You have some nerve. Carmen and I have started a new life. There is no need to bring up the past. - Isn't that for Carmen to decide. - I'm her husband. I decide what is right. - I'll go. When shall I be ready? - As soon as possible, tonight. - Thank you, no. You keep it. - Carmen. - Don't worry about it. I'll make sure she gets there and back safely. You have my word on it. - Your word means nothing to me. I'm coming with you. - That's not such a good idea. - Either I come or I see to it that she doesn't. That woman is my family. And my family means everything to me. - That's all very admirable, but not necessary. - It is if you want her to come. - If you wish. Just make sure that you and her are packed and ready to leave at five o'clock. - That's three hours. - I didn't ask you to come. - I'll be ready. - Hi Mags, it's me Cary. Please wake up so everyone stops crying. Do you think she can hear me? Yeah I do. - Why doesn't she get up? - She will soon hunny. She's just resting now because she's sick. - I'm not a kid anymore mom I can handle it. She is dying isn't she? - Listen to me. Your sister is not gonna die Cary, do you understand? Do you understand me? - You're hurting him mom. - Sweetheart, oh my god. Cary go get the nurse. I said go get the nurse. Hunny, oh sweetie how do you feel? - I'm tired, sore and my arm hurts very bad. - Which arm? - The one you're sitting on. - Oh god. - I'm just joking mom. - We're gonna get you outta here soon hun. - Considering I'm only leaving this place in a coffin, I prefer later rather than sooner. - Shhh, don't talk like that. - I'm not dead yet and I'm also not deaf. I heard you and the doctors talking. - Sweetheart, I should have known about your condition. - How could you have known? - Hunny I made so many mistakes. Now you're paying for them. - I don't remember you being this dramatic my whole life. What's goin' on? - I have to tell you something. - I'm adopted, I don't care. For better or for worse, you're my mom and always have been. - How did you know? - I'm not deaf. - How are you feeling? - Tired and very sore. - That's from the drugs and the dialysis. It's good to see you up though. Is there anything I can get for you? - I could use a margarita. - Me too Maggie. - Let's go get one. I'll meet you downstairs in five. It's gotta be happy hour somewhere. - Sounds great. It's a date. Doctor will be here in a few minutes. - He was handsome. - He's not my type. - Oh no, what is? - Anyone with a compatible kidney. - Where do you find your strength? - I guess I'm never bothered much by the little things. - Hunny this, this isn't a little thing. - To you and the people who love me it isn't but in the end aren't we all just little things? - This is not your end. - I appreciate your optimism mother but I can feel it. - No you don't understand. Malcolm found your real mother hunny. She's flying here with him right now and she's gonna give you her kidney. - What? In less than two days, Malcolm just found my real mother? - Cary could you please wait in the waiting room? - But mom I wanted to her - I understand but this is important. Please wait in the waiting room. You can talk to her when you get back. - Alright. Mags, you promise to be awake when I get back? - I promise. - Hurry up mom. - I am very excited. This sounds like it's gonna be good. - I don't really know how to tell you this so I'm just gonna say it. - Ooh, now I'm worried. You never have trouble telling us what you think. - Maggie. - Wait! My real mother is Kris Kardashian and we're gonna be on a reality show? - Maggie stop it, please! Your real mother didn't put you up for adoption. You were taken from her. You were kidnapped and sold to us. - Why would you do such a thing? - Hunny I know it sounds horrible but you have to believe me I didn't know. I never knew. I was 24 years old. Some idiot doctor told me that I was infertile. I was devastated. And then one day your father came home and brought me a book with pictures of these young children who all needed a home. He told me to pick the one I wanted to adopt. And hunny I chose you. - You didn't think that seemed a little suspicious? - Yeah maybe I did. Maybe I just didn't want to know because three weeks later hunny you were in my arms and I didn't care where you came from. Your father arranged the whole thing. He did it out of love for me. - Can you leave my room? - I never lied to you. You have to believe me when I tell you I just found out myself. - Just give me a minute okay? I need to absorb this. I don't know what to think. - Maggie? I'm glad you're up. I'd like to examine you if you don't mind. - Sure Doc, but can you make my mother wait outside? Certainly if that's what you want. - It is. - It's fine. I'll just be in the waiting room just around the corner. - So I'm thinking about grabbing a movie later and I might have a date with that nurse, so if you could just hurry this along. - Well I'll do my best. You mind sitting up for me? There you go. Take a deep breath. Again. alright let's finish the exam shall we? Good. - Speak English while you're in this country please. Why? - English. - Okay, why? - I don't want to attract attention from these people. I don't want her family to see us as Mexican. You made me learn English for a reason and I want to use it. - But I am Mexican and I'm proud of it. - I am too but being Mexican can be a crime in this country Is that why you can't sleep? - I can't sleep, I can't. - Well you need to try. I don't want to have your daughter seeing you like this for the first time. - English please. - What is wrong with me? Maybe we should go home. Maybe she's going to be embarrassed of me. - Your daughter is dying. I don't think she's going to care what your hair looks like. - What is wrong with my hair? - You know the first time I saw you, I knew you were the most beautiful woman I had ever seen? - That was 20 years ago. - I still feel the same way. Only now, you're even more beautiful on the inside. - Thank you for coming. I don't know how I could have done it without you here. - We're in this together. - Malcolm. Are they here? - Yes. In a hotel close by. I figured I'd let them rest and then go get them in the morning. - Wow, that's good yeah? You did good Malcolm. - I did what I had to do. - I just can't believe how quickly they came. - Yeah well I'm glad she chose to come in the way she did. The alternative would have been messy. - So she's ready then? - Not exactly. I didn't tell her about the kidney. - What? Malcolm, the process has to start tomorrow. We don't have time. - Look she knows almost everything already. I didn't think she would come if I told her about giving us her kidney. - But why not? - I guess you didn't read Maggie's file. Maggie's illness comes from her mother. If she gives Maggie her kidney, she may die herself. - Oh god! - God is not a part of this. You have to be strong. - Did I do the right thing? - I don't know if you did the right thing or the wrong thing you did the only thing. - I mean at what cost? - Sharon, you didn't know. - Didn't I? I always knew there was something wrong, even in my gut. I may not have done it but I certainly turned my head from it. - Okay, then knowing what you know now and the woman that you've raised, would you do it again? - They're here. Hello. We are so happy you're here. - Thank you. - Thank you for coming. Please come and meet my family. These are my boys, Cary, Jason and Taylor. - Hello. - Taylor. - On behalf of our whole family, we want to welcome you to our family. - Thank you. - Are you ready to go upstairs to meet your daughter? - Yes of course. - Good, come with me. Carmen, before you go in, I was wondering if I could have a word with you in private? - We don't keep any secrets. - Okay um well, I just wanted to say from the bottom of my heart, how truly sorry I am about all of this. I only found out two days ago myself when we first started looking for you. I can't imagine what it must have been like for you. - I think like watching your daughter die in front of you. - Maggie is expecting you. She's um just through those doors, 2nd door on the right. - I'll be right here. - You can come in. I won't bite. - Hello. - I don't know what to say, you're so pretty. - No I am not. You are. You have become such a beautiful woman. - Now I guess I'm not. - You are, I can see you. - Where are you from? - Mexico. - I'm Mexican. - Yes. - Well. - I have a picture of us if you'd like to see it. - That would be nice. - You were two years old. - Can I ask you a question? - Anything. - Do you still know my father? - No. I don't. - Did you get divorced? - No, I was young. - I see, I was a mistake. I guess that makes sense. - No, no, don't ever think that. If you were a mistake, then my whole like was a mistake. - I don't understand. - Can I ask you a question? - If you tell me who my father is, I will answer your question. - I don't know who your father is. - Oh geeze. Too many lovers? - No, I was a virgin. - Then tell me please. Don't make a dying girl beg. - When I was fifteen years old, my mother had just died. I had no family or friends. I was on my own. I needed to take care of myself so I got a job as a maid at a resort. It used to take me one hour bus ride to work each way and I told them that I was 18 years old and, because I looked older they believed me. And the people were nice to me. Other than my mom, nobody was nice to me. At first I loved working there. It was so beautiful. My job was to clean and prepare the rooms. I met so many people from so many parts of the world. Most of them so nice to us. We were never supposed to go into a room if someone was still inside. They would always tell us to leave the door open when cleaning the room. Housekeeping. So I went into room 505 and it was a mess like you can't believe. Empty alcohol bottles everywhere, sheets covered in dirt. I was so focused on cleaning the mess. I did not here the door close. - What's your name baby? Don't be shy. What's your name. - Carmen. - That's a beautiful name for a beautiful girl. Don't be scared Carmen. This can be fun for you too. - Please don't hurt me. - Well that is up to you. If you fight me you will get hurt very bad. Look at me, no crying. Do you understand? Good girl. Take off your clothes. - I am so sorry. I wish that it was something romantic or foolish. I am so sorry. - So, I'm a kidnapped baby who was the product of a rape by a nameless, faceless animal. I bet looking at me laying here, you wish you had just aborted me. - No, not for one moment. I loved you. You changed my life. I still love you. - You don't even know me. Shit, I don't even think I know me anymore. Can you just give me a minute to process this? - I may not have seen you in the last 20 years, but I have always been with you right here. I was always there. You are not a mistake. You were the one good thing that I had in my life. - You okay? Come here. - She is a wonderful woman. You did a very good job. - Thank you. - I think we should leave. I think me being here has upset her. - Okay. - No, no, you can't leave. - I think it is the right thing to do. You are her family. We are not. - But you are, you are her family. In fact, you're her only family. We need you to stay. - I appreciate it Sharon but the poor girl in there is dying She should not have brought up all of these emotions. What she needs is peace and love. - No, she needs something else. - What do you mean? - She means Maggie needs the love of her real mother. - No Malcolm. We don't have time for this game. Would you please just sit down and hear me out? Maggie is dying. Now it could be tomorrow. It could be a month from now. However, there is something that can save her. A new kidney. - I knew it. - From a perfect match. - Omar please. - Carmen, you could be that match. - Why didn't you tell us this before we came? I knew you needed something. - So what you're saying is, she can live if I give her a kidney? - If you're a match, yes. She'll live. We just have to run some tests, see if you are. - Well I'm sorry, she can't do this. Carmen we have to go. - Omar, stop it. - No. - What is this? - She got her kidney disease from me. I have been taking pills for the last 20 years to slow down its progress. - So you understand what she's going through? What's the problem? - The problem is, she gives Maggie her kidney, she could threaten her own life. - Even if she is a match, giving her a bad kidney isn't necessarily going to help her. In fact it may kill them both, do you understand that? - Okay can we just do the test to see if she is a match? Otherwise this is all for nothing. - I will take the tests. - Thank you. - Omar, Omar. I'm just going to get tested to see if I'm a match. - Omar please. Please speak in English. - Just because they took her away from me doesn't mean I am not her mother. - And what about your family at home? Are you not their mother too? - Omar how dare you? - These people are evil. Can't you see what they've done? - I don't know Omar. I don't know about what they did or did not do. - I don't know about all that Omar. I don't know. - Hey, I'm sorry. I just don't want to see you get hurt. what if you're a match? Then what? - I don't know. Please, come with me. Please. - Carmen the doctor is ready to do the tests when you are. Oh Omar I don't think you can go back in. - Yes I can. - It's alright, if he wants to go let him go. - Can I sit? - Absolutely, if you don't mind the smoke. - I didn't know you smoked. - Yeah neither did I. I just started two days ago. - Does it help? - If I didn't smoke I would be eating five gallons of ice cream. - Can I ask you a question? What would you do in my position, if the roles were reversed? - I would do it. - What about your other children? - They'll live. I mean isn't that all we can really ask for in the end, that our children grow up to live long and happy lives? It's a burden us mothers carry. My husband, Maggie's father, and all the other men and their actions that brought us two mothers together right now. What are we left with? The final decision and the burden. Are the results in? - Not yet, but your daughter is requesting to see you. - Me or Carmen? - Both. - Can you guys come sit with me? I just wanted to ask you both a question and to tell you something. - What is it sweetheart? - I was wondering if it would be alright if I could also call Carmen "Mom"? - If it's alright with Sharon then it's alright with me. Mom? - If that makes you happy. - Okay good. I was worried about that. - What was the thing you wanted to tell us? - No one every tells you what it feels like but you can feel it. You can actually feel death coming. I don't know how long I have but it isn't long. Mom, I don't wanna die. - Oh, honey. You're gonna be okay. - And mom, you have been with me my whole life. You being here has meant the world to me. - What honey? - This song. How do I know this song? - You used to get so excited when you would watch it on TV. And it is also your name. I mean the name I gave you was Claridad. - What does it mean? - Clarity. At that time, I didn't know what my life was going to be. And you gave a girl like me perfect clarity. I knew no matter how hard it was, I had to keep trying for you. - Would it be okay if you called me Claridad ? - Maggie. - Claridad! - Nurse, Nurse! Listen to my voice honey. Honey, honey listen to my voice, stay with me baby. Stay with me. Nurse! Maggie, Maggie stay with us. Jonathan, prepare 10 CC's of Atavan stat. Maggie, it'll be alright. - Where's Carmen? - She went for a walk. - Oh. - You know, even if the tests come back positive, there's no way Carmen is going to risk her life to save your daughter. - Well I think that's Carmen's decision. - Really? Would you risk your life for 15%? - 15%? - It's the chance she has to live if she ever damages her good kidney. - How do you know that? - The doctors told us. - The results are in. - I'm Doctor Mason. Doctor Conway asked me to share the results with you. Carmen you're a perfect match. - Oh thank god. - Now if you decide to proceed, I will be the surgeon. So we need to discuss what happens next. - So now that she is a match, can you say for sure that Maggie won't reject the kidney? - No, there is no certainty with this type of thing. We only have the information that's in front of us so we have to act based on that. - So she could still do this thing, risk her life, and it not help anyone? - That possibility exists and especially with this type of procedure and since your condition could deteriorate we will need to have extensive waivers of liability from you Carmen. - But you can say with certainty that Carmen is putting her life at risk by doing this procedure. - I can tell you that there is risk involved with any procedure, particularly this one due to its nature. - Can I ask you a question doctor? Yes Malcolm. - Can you say with absolute certainty that if Maggie does not get this kidney, she will die. - Yes I can say that with certainty. When, I don't know but she will have no quality of life. She is at the end stage. If we don't do something now, it'll be too late regardless if you have a kidney or not. You all have much to discuss so I will leave you to it. Take as much time as you need and Carmen, I just want to say I've been doing this a long time. This is a decision that should not be made by anybody but you. You are giving a gift of life to someone. In the end, it should be your decision and yours alone. Have the nurse page me when you decide. - Thank you Doctor. Can I have a little time please? - Okay look, that's precisely what we don't have. We need to know. - This isn't a used car. This is a life and the life of another person. - Omar please. - So she needs to take her time and decide what she's going to do so that your daughter can live. - We will give you time but just know that we are in this together and I will do anything for Maggie. Anything you need, anything your family needs, anything just - Okay Sharon. Let's give them a moment. We'll wait outside. - Carmen, I have never begged anyone for anything in my life but I am begging you. She's your daughter too. Come on Sharon. - And you can decide whether she lives or dies. - That's enough Sharon. - So what do you think? - I hope she makes the right decision. - And if she doesn't? - Look, look at everything. Look at us. Look at the children. Look at the last 20 years. Just think about this moment right now. This situation. Why do want to do this? I've asked you a dozen times and you don't give me a straight answer, why? - Because, I chose to bring her into this world. And now I get to choose what happens to her. - I can't watch you die Carmen. - I was already dead when you met me. Do you remember that first night? I decided when you left for work that morning that I was going to end it. - Why didn't you? - Because, I found someone who looked at me like I was a person. Like it meant something to him. - So why throw it all away? - I am not throwing anything away my love. I am giving someone that I never gave anything to, a chance at life. I owe her that. No matter where she is, she will always be my little girl and I can't turn my back on her. - So why play these games? Why not just tell them that you'll go through with it and be done with it? What if I take you out of this place right now? And I drag you to the airport? - You're too good a man to do that. - This isn't fair Carmen. - I need you to do something for me. It will sound extreme but it is important to me. For once, they are going to have to pay a price for what they want. - Did she make a decision? - She has. Come inside. - Have you made your decision Carmen? - I am going to do it. - Malcolm! Malcolm, why is he tied down? Malcolm, Malcolm? I don't understand, what's, what's happening here? - I have decided to give Claridad my kidney. - Yes I know I think that's wonderful but, we should really to it because we're running out of time. - I find it funny that you say the word, we. There's no we in your life. There is no we in any of your lives. - I don't understand what you're saying. Please just say what you mean. - I will do it under two conditions. - Okay. - The first is money. - Okay fine I have lots of money. If that's all you want, this is, this is not necessary. - You didn't ask how much. - How much? - Half. - Half of what? - Half of all of your money. - What? - I think you heard me. - You must be kidding. Do you have any idea how much money I have? - No I don't but I am sure that it is enough. I'm wondering what is the price you are willing to pay to save Maggie's life? - You don't think I love my daughter? You don't think I would give anything for her? - There's only one way to find out. I don't want all, just half. Don't I deserve that for my life? Or is the life of a Mexican woman not equal to yours? - I never said that. I would do anything for my children but this is extortion. - You can leave any time you want. You leave and I leave, head straight to the airport and go home to my family. - Okay, fine. You have my word. I'll give you the money. - Call your financial guy. - Right now? - Yes. - I I don't think Maggie has that much time to waste while we do this. - Well then you better hurry because you don't get to our 2nd condition until the first one has been met. Have them wire the money to this account. - No matter what happens. Make sure Claridad gets my kidney. - Okay. - No I cannot hold. I need to speak with Todd right now. - We can still go home. Are you sure you want to do this? - Yes. I told you I couldn't have done this without you. - Yes yeah I know I know. I don't care if the bank is in Mexico, just send it. Do it! Alright. Thank you Todd, I appreciate it. It's done. What was the 2nd thing? What is this? - It is a way for us to get in the same boat. I am taking all the risk here. I have a family too, three boys just like you. And a husband who loves me. Why are we always taking the risk while you rich people use us, abuse us, and discard us like we are nothing? You never get your hands dirty. We pay the entire price while you collect the prize. Your life never has any fear. If you shoot me, then what? - Then I'll shoot him. - If you shoot him then I will leave and Maggie will die. - What do you want? - I want us to share in the sacrifice together. - And how do you expect to do that? - Omar, please explain. - As you know, Carmen only has a 15% chance of surviving if she gives you the kidney. - Yes I know. - So you know how to use a gun? That's good. Pick it up. Open it. How many bullets are inside? - Five. - And how many chambers? - Six. What's one divided by six? - I don't know. Tell me. - Have you ever played Russian roulette? - What? - My wife only has a 15% chance of living after this operation. There's one empty chamber in the gun, which means that you have a 17% chance. - Alright, okay. Those are better chances than my wife. - Okay, just we are all under a lot of stress here. - That's just it. We're going to make the same sacrifice together. I am willing to take these bad bets to save Claridad. Are you willing to take the same risk to save Maggie? - What are you doing? Shoot them! Come on! Shoot Carmen in the fucking face! Put one in his head too. - I can't. - What are you planning on doing with this? - You better kill me Omar. Otherwise I'm gonna go to Mexico and I'm gonna personally rip the kidneys out of each and every one of your kids because they're probably a match. - You told me that if the roles were reversed, you'd do the same thing. Well they are. You do this and I will give her my kidney. - Please. I can't. Please. - Come on Omar. - Wait wait wait. - Everybody, can I get your attention? Umm, I just wanted to officially welcome our new extended family from Mexico. We love having you guys here. I also wanted to say how much I love you all and appreciate all that you have done for me this past year. It was extremely difficult but I was able to get through it with your help. And finally, I would like to ask you all to take this time to remember our loved one who is no longer with us. She is gone but she will forever be right here. - Cheers. - Would you like to propose a toast mom?
