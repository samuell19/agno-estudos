Excuse me. Do you work here? - Yes. - Well... I want to buy some fish, but I don't know what kind. My therapist said fish can help my insomnia. Can you recommend something? I don't know what kind of fish will help. What are these? They're Peacock Fish. I'll just buy some Peacock Fish then. They only live two years. What? Maybe not even two years. Are there any fish that live longer? Make sure to change the water. What? Change the water. Sure. Okay. Okay then. Thank you. If you change the water every week, the fish will live longer. Sunshine Aquarium Happy birthday! Look! All your favorite dishes. Thank you, Mom. Let's start. Eat the fish first. It won't be good if it's cold. Have some rice with it. Here. I was talking to Madam Liu about you today at work. Did you know she has a daughter? She's a nurse at the hospital. I arranged for you two to have dinner on the coming Saturday. You're almost 30 years old, but you're still not married. Maybe I just haven't met the right one yet. Since you haven't met your Mrs. Right, so I'm helping you with romantic opportunities. Look at you. You're so handsome and refined and I've raised you to be so polite. I'm sure Madam Liu's daughter is going to love you. I don't think so. I'm not going to be with you forever. Do you want me to spend my entire life worrying about you? No. That's not what I meant. Good. Okay. Let's take a photo to remember! Hold on. Your hair's a little messy. Let's make sure you look good. Smile! Let me see your teeth. Okay. Make three wishes. Say two out loud and keep the last one silent. My first wish is for our good health. My second is for our happiness. Good. Blow out the candles. Happy birthday! Hi. Are you Xiao-Hong? Yes. I'm Ting-Ting. Got it. I'm Xiao-Hong. I know. I heard you work in a fish store. Yes. I also like animals. I have a really cute Corgi. His name is Mantou. Do you like dogs? Yes. I like dogs. What's your favorite kind of dog? Sorry. It's okay. You can answer it. It's okay. It's okay. Maybe you should answer it. It could be an emergency. Xiao-Hong? Why didn't you pick up earlier? Yes. Xiao-Hong? I didn't hear the ring. What is it? How's the food? Not bad. Ask Ting-Ting if she likes the food. My mom wants to ask you if you like the food? It's not bad. She said it's not bad. So do you think there's a chance? I'll tell you when I get home. Okay. Talk to you then. My friend asked me to go see a movie. I should probably get going. Can we get the check? Sure. Maltese. What? My favorite kind of dog. Xiao-Hong. Guess where I went last night? An army buddy of mine is getting married. We showed him a good time. We took him to a private place where you need a referral. And do you know? The girl I got... She still has me hard! Meiling. Do you know how many radishes we have in stock? No, I don't know. What's wrong? Nothing. Your daughter thinks she's so special? What does that mean? Nothing, forget it. I wasn't going to say anything, but since you brought it up... Ting-Ting said that Xiao-Hong isn't normal. She isn't normal. My son is just shy. Ting-Ting said your son is a mama's boy. Mama's boy? - What's wrong with that? - Mom... Are you ready? Wait for me outside. My son picks me up from work. How sweet. I didn't want to say anything, but your daughter should really watch her weight. Listen to my call, bringing forth a spring chill See me turning the fields yellow Who is anxious about autumn's glow I wander in the forest, full of feelings Xiao-Hong, hold on. Forget about Madam Liu's daughter. I know plenty of other girls. I'm sure they'd love to meet you. Mom. Can you stop setting me up with girls? Why? It's kind of... Awkward. Awkward? What's awkward? How else will you meet a girl? Tell me how to make it less awkward. Okay. I'll make sure to find the right one for you. Red flowers fall Maples turn red Wake up! Get moving! Xiao-Hong. How was your date the other night? Don't play dumb. Your mom told my mom about it. How did it go? What? Nothing happened. Are you kidding me? With the genes our family has? I forgot you don't have much experience. Let me help you. How? Never mind, I'll just walk home. What are you doing? But you... Where are you going? Come on. I'm doing this for you. I've arranged everything. Come on. Forget it. If you don't, I'm going to tell your mom. But... I didn't do anything. I'm going to tell her you did everything. Come on. It's okay. Over here. We're already here, just relax. I promise. Girls here are unlike those on the Internet who don't even look like their photo. Overnight or hourly? We're here to see Ms. Lele. We have an appointment. Where are you going? Are you guys coming or going? We're already here. Why would we leave? This is my cousin, Xiao-Hong. It's his first time. He's a virgin. So I hope that you will take extra good care of him. This handsome kid is a virgin? - Stop teasing your cousin. - It's true. You're all set. Peach is in Room 617 waiting for you. Go ahead. Okay, thank you. We'll pay together. He celebrated his birthday not long ago. So this is on me. Your cousin treats you well. Ms. Lele, since we're paying together, is there a discount? What discount? Do you think we're a supermarket? Of course not. I was just joking. The first time is important. It should be full-price. This is the best birthday present ever. Okay, hurry up. Okay, thank you. Then... - Please take care of him. - Don't worry, I got it. Room 671? Room 617. Okay. Thank you. Are you really a virgin? What? If you are, you get a lucky red envelope. Okay. I booked Apple especially for you. I'll walk you over. Apple. He's all yours. Come in. Go ahead. Are you going to just stand there? Sorry. How should we start? It's really up to you. You can take a shower first. There's a bathroom. Do I have to shower? It's up to you. Some guys shower first. Some guys shower after. It's up to you. I'm okay then. Then sit down here. I'm going to blow you. Okay. Thank you. Sit up a little. What are you doing? I'm sorry. You don't like it? What are you doing out here? I'm done. Don't go anywhere. Xinyi. Call Apple and see if she's okay. Okay. Apple is fine. Okay. Good. Sorry for the misunderstanding. We have to be careful. There's still some time left. Do you want to go back upstairs? That's okay. That was enough. Okay. Sorry. Can I wait for my cousin here? Of course. Thank you. Do you work at a fish store? What? It's written on your shirt. I see. Yes. I have a fish tank at home. I used to have over ten fish, but somehow I killed almost all of them. There's only one that survived. What kind of fish? I don't know. What does it look like? About this long. With a red belly. It's probably a Lantern Fish. They aren't hard to raise, but they're afraid of light. Plant some algae and they should be fine. You know a lot about fish. Ms. Lele. Go take a break. It's early. Okay. That guy was a "manager." What's a manager? They arrange the girls. They bring the girls to me and I schedule them for you "guests." Xiao-Hong. What are you doing out here? What are you doing out here too? I don't need any more time. I'm efficient and accurate. So you're laughing now? Why so fast? Did you waste my money? He just walked out too. Right before you did. Your cousin is efficient and accurate too. Not bad. Pretty good for a first-timer. Let's go get a snack. Thank you, Ms. Lele. Wait. If you want to come back, just call me directly. Thank you, Ms. Lele. Bye. What was that? I'm leaving. Bye. - Goodnight, Ms. Lele. - Goodnight, Ms. Lele. Ms. Lele. Send me more customers like that one tonight. Which one? The kid that ran off early. He panicked before we started and left. I like innocent ones like that. Stop dreaming. None of them are that innocent. Bye. You look tired tonight. I'm tired every night. Here. Try this. This is a strong pour. It's strong, but you'll sleep better later. Hey. Do you know him? I don't. But he's always smiling at me. Another doomed romance. He's not bad-looking. Do you want to give it a try? No, thank you. It might be fun. Don't take it seriously. Would you like to dance? Okay. What's wrong with you? I'm just messing around. Don't be mad. Remember those biotech stocks I bought? I didn't make shit with them. The number you dialed could not be connected. I'm glad I dumped them early. Playing the stock market takes patience. I'll tell you though... Making money on stocks is faster than anything. A friend of mine bought a bunch of houses playing stocks. He's better than any stockbroker. I bought some of the same stocks. They kept going up! It's crazy! Do you hear that? They kept going up! - I can introduce you sometime. - Sure. So how many houses have you bought? What does that mean? I'm just trying to help you out. If you don't want it, fine! - I didn't say that. Thanks for your offer. - Weijie. Keep your advice to yourself. This is for you. The money for these two boxes. Thank you. Thank you again. This wine is really hard to get. Not for me! I have the right connections. I'm starting up my own business. Really? I have a website already. Check it out. Amazing! It's no big deal. The number you dialed could not be connected. Make a right up here. Mom! You scared me to death. I've been calling you. Why didn't you pick up? I need to talk to you. Didn't I just lend you money? It's not money. There's something else I want to discuss. I'll tell you more upstairs. You were working late again. I had meetings all night too. I've only just finished. This apartment is getting old. I'll get you a new place once I make some money. My friend's in real estate. We're pretty close so he gives me some great deals. I plan on buying a place in the next year or two. I'll buy one for you too. I want to tell you about an investment opportunity. Check it out. This bottle usually costs 10,000 dollars. I can get it for only 500 dollars. So what are you doing now? Selling fake liquor? It's not fake. We have a viniculturist in the US. The wine he makes is exactly the same. Take a look. Even the label is identical. What does this have to do with me? Everything! You can be my investor. We'll split the profits. You can make back your money in a week and double it in two. I already have a website. I'm not interested. Go ask your dad. Dad moved to Shenzhen to open an Internet cafe with his girlfriend. He didn't tell you? I don't know what he's up to. Anyway, he won't answer my calls. I can't reach him. Are you sure you won't consider it? I'm hitting it big this time. Please save your money. I'm just glad you're not borrowing money. I'm not interested. Mom, please just think about it. Or how about... Lend me 50,000 dollar? It's not what you think. I need to pay my friend for the first shipment. Do you think I'm a bank? I don't have that much to lend you. The most I can do is buy a few bottles. Just leave me alone, okay? I'm going to take a shower. Don't forget to lock the door when you leave. I'm leaving now. Xiao-Hong. Time to get up. Xiao-Hong. You're going to be late for work. Get up. Mom, I'm running late. Hold on. I packed it up for you. Eat it on the way. Okay. Why were you out so late last night? Wen-Hao took me out for a late-night snack to celebrate my birthday. But why didn't you tell me first? I was up all night waiting. I barely slept. I'm sorry. It's okay. Don't do it again. I know. Let's eat. Xiao-Hong, time to eat. Hello? Hello? Hello. Is this Ms. Lele? Yes, speaking. Who is this? It's Xiao-Hong. You gave me your business card downstairs a few days ago. Okay. You're the one that works in the fish store. Do you want to make an appointment? Yes. Okay. When do you want? Is tomorrow night okay? Sure. What type of girl do you want this time? The same as before is okay. No problem. Apple is free. Is tomorrow night at eight okay? Yes. Okay, then see you tomorrow night. Bye. Thank you. Olive oil is buy one, get one free. You can go grab another bottle. But I can't use so much by myself. Do you want another one or not? How about I get another one and give it to you? No, thank you. That will be 29 dollars. Thank you. Mom. I'll be home late tonight so I can't pick you up. You'll have to go home on your own. Bye. Meiling. Your son isn't picking you up tonight? He's still at work. I see. Too bad for you. You're here. Hi, Ms. Lele. You're all set. It's Apple again in Room 612. Okay. You can walk over now. Have a good time. Okay. It's you. Come in. Listen to my call, bringing forth a spring chill See me turning the fields yellow Okay. That was very good. Ms. Chiang. You were off-key on the chorus. Just a little bit. - Who is anxious about autumn's glow? - Who is anxious about autumn's glow? -I wander in the forest, full of feelings -I wander in the forest, full of feelings Hello. I'm a new member of the group. Everyone calls me Wu. I'm treating everyone to tofu desert, do you want to join? Sure, I can go. How about you? Thank you, but I'm going home. Why is he so generous? I heard he's a retired police academy professor. Maybe he has a big pension. Hello? Ms. Lele. I'd like to make an appointment. Hello? Ms. Lele. I'd like to make an appointment. Ms. Lele. I'd like to make an appointment. Sure. Apple is in Room 612. Okay. Ms. Lele Thank you. You're too polite. Hurry up. We don't want to hear any more crap. If you don't get us the money, we won't give you a single box of wine. You get none of this. I know. But I just have some slight cashflow problems. If you can just give me the wine, once I sell it, I'll pay you back right away. I have a website already. Fine. Let's not make life so difficult. I'll make an exception this time. Thank you, Mr. Wu. Thank you. No big deal. My personal belief is young people have to strike out on their own. I won't disappoint you. Hi, Ms. Lele. We have some new girls. If you want to try something new, I can arrange it. That's okay. Apple is fine. Okay, you can walk over now. Ms. Lele. I brought... Hello? Okay, I'll be right down. What are you still doing here? Get going. Mr. Zhong, is there something I can help with? Routine inspection. I just want to take a look at your guest list. No problem. Xinyi, did you give them what they need? I gave it to them. Sir, everything looks fine. The names in this logbook are all hotel guests? Of course. What else would they be? You know that we've always been a legitimate business. Go check out every floor. Xinyi, I can handle this. Please take him upstairs. Sorry, can you please make sure not to disturb our guests? - Thank you. - Okay. Sorry for the trouble. No big deal. Thank you. Aren't you bored sitting there? Do you want me to watch some adult movies with you? That's okay, thank you. Is everything okay? That weird kid left this for you. What is it? I don't know. What is it? I think it's algae. Why would he give you algae? I don't know. How was he tonight? Same as usual. We didn't do anything and he left. You guys never do anything? That's right. Easy money. Xiao-Hong. I have a hot date tonight. Close up the store for me. I'm leaving, bye. Okay. You're closed? Ms. Lele. What are you doing here? I was getting my nails done and realized your fish store was close by. So I thought I'd come by and check it out. Thank you for your algae. You're welcome. Have you been working here long? Yes. A couple of years. It's my uncle's store. Apple told me what you guys have been doing. You guys haven't been doing anything. Do you like wasting money? Or are you just bored? Go karaoke or get some food with friends. It's better than wasting your money. I don't have many friends. You don't have any brothers or sisters? No. Anyway... Don't come and see our girls anymore. I feel guilty taking your money. I didn't go for the girls. Then why do you keep coming? You really are a weird kid. I have the night off tonight. I was going to go get a drink. Do you want to come? What? Do you already have plans? No. Then let's go. Okay. Sunshine Aquarium So you really never had a girlfriend? No. How's that possible? You're actually not bad-looking. Pretty clean-cut. Fix yourself up and I'm sure girls will like you. Maybe... I'm just not that good with girls. I make them uncomfortable. Have some confidence. When you're talking to people, look them in the eyes. If I say you're fine, then you're fine. Say it with me. "I'm fine and girls will like me." Try it. I'm fine. Girls will like me. That's better. Ms. Lele. Do you know him? Not really. He's a pretty good dancer. He's okay. Do you know how to dance? Yes. Waltz, cha-cha, rhumba, blues... I used to dance here when I was younger. It has been almost 20 years. So I know this bar well. Do you still dance? No one to dance with. I met most of my ex-boyfriends through dancing. But it never ended well. I have bad luck when it comes to romance. You're in a good mood tonight. You're on your third drink. It's none of your business. Hey, handsome. Do you want a drink? I can buy you a shot. How about it? That's okay. I came here by scooter. That's not fair. Ms. Meixiu hasn't bought me a shot in forever. You're not a handsome boy. Ms. Lele. Can I give you a ride home? That's okay. I'll just take a taxi. That's very sweet of you. Where to? Jinzhou Street, thank you. Ms. Lele. Can I come see you again? Of course. Come by the hotel anytime. Bye. Bye. Are you dancing? What? Are you dancing? Yes. I'm sorry. What do you need? Well... I want to buy some rocks for my fish tank. Rocks... Here. The rocks are here. You can pick some yourself. Okay. Ms. Meixiu gave us shots. So she only treats handsome boys? Of course. Here. Let's down it. A drink won't hurt you. It's still early. Cheers. Not bad. Girls don't like wishy-washy guys. Ms. Lele. Do you want to dance? Do you want to dance with me? I thought you didn't know how? I watched some clips online. I think I can try. You learned how to dance? Let's see you dance then. Left, right. Left, right. Left, left, left, right. Left, that's it. You don't need to be so formal. Just relax. Here, follow me. Left, right. Left, right. Left, left, left, right. Left, right. Left, right. Left, left, left, right. Mr. Wang. Where do you want these? Get that garbage out of here! What's wrong, Mr. Wang? You're asking me what's wrong? Two of my customers passed out from your wine last night. They had to go to emergency. You're ruining my reputation! I can guarantee you that had nothing to do with my wine. Get out of here now or I'm calling the police. Mr. Wang, you already ordered these. Okay then. - Mr. Wang, you're going to cost me money. - Tell it to the police. Get out of my sight! I never want to see you again! Darn it! What kind of attitude is that? No way. Darn it. Xiao-Hong, what are you doing? Come help me with these! They're heavy! Here. I'm going in. Mom. Do I need to pick you up after class? Why are you asking? Are you busy tonight? I might go see a friend. What friend? Hi, Meiling. Hi, Ms. Chiang. You don't have to pick me up. - I'll get a ride home with Ms. Chiang. - Okay. Ms. Lele. Can I give you a ride home? Sure. Xiao-Hong I brought late-night snacks. Xiao-Hong. Thank you. Ms. Lele. I want to tell you something. What is it? I only went back to the hotel to see you. I know. I've had a good time. You'd better get home. Ride safely. Good night, Ms. Lele. Good night. Where were you? Why are you home so late? You've never acted like this before. I'm sorry. You haven't told me who your new friend is. You're not going to tell me who it is? Who were you out with so late? Lele. Lele? A woman? Yes. Are you dating? Kind of. Why didn't you tell me? How did you meet her? Wen-Hao introduced us. Wen-Hao? Your cousin finally did something useful. I want to meet her right away. I want to see this Lele. Hello. Who are you looking for? Is Wang Weijie here? He doesn't live here. What do you want? Are you his mom? Your son owes us 50,000 dollars, but we can't find him. The money he owes is one thing, but he almost got us in trouble with the police. So next time you see him, tell him to hurry and pay us back or we'll come visit you again. Talk to him if he owes you money. It has nothing to do with me. Excuse me. Can't you tell we're really bad guys? This is Weijie's problem, not mine. Don't come here again. I know the police very well. I'll call them if you show up again. How scary. Your call has gone directly to voicemail. Please leave your message after the beep. Xiao-Hong! Who's this? This is my cousin, Xiao-Hong. You're coming here on your own now. You didn't even ask me along. - Not bad. - Do you come here a lot? Not really. Listen. Don't get addicted, okay? What if your mom found out I was responsible? So tell me... Which girl are you here to see? I'm not here to see a girl. I'm here to see Ms. Lele. You again. I'm just here to see Ms. Lele. I was waiting for her downstairs - but... - She's smoking on the roof. Thank you. Ms. Lele. You should go home. I'm a little tired today. What about you? Are you going home soon? Yes. I'll take a taxi home later. You should go. I think... you should stop coming to see me for now. Why? Things are a mess right now. I want to be alone. Is there anything I can do to help? Hey! It's locked! Did you lock the trunk? Unlock it again. Sweet! Excuse me. What's your relationship to the patient? I'm his mom. What are you doing here? Happy to see me beaten up like this? What exactly happened? I asked you to help but you didn't. So I had to borrow money, but the police took all my inventory. These guys are like loan sharks. They kept adding more and more interest. Who are you? Why are you just standing there? I'm Xiao-Hong. What are you doing here? He's my friend. What friend? What are you doing here? I'm keeping Ms. Lele company. Company? What are you keeping her company for? I'm talking to my mom. Get lost! Xiao-Hong. You should go home. I'll call you later. Okay. Bye, Ms. Lele. Hope you feel better. Get out of here! So how much money do you owe? It was 50,000 dollars at first. But with interest, at the end of the month... it'll be 100,000 dollar. I don't have that much money. Forget it then. Just leave me for dead. Nurse! Can you ask her to leave? I want to get some rest. I got married when I was really young. We divorced right after I had Weijie. His dad spent all his time with girlfriends, never with Weijie. I couldn't take care of him because of work. Honestly... Every time he shows up, he asks for money. I can't ever believe a word he says. I have no idea what to do with him. Xiao-Hong. What are you doing here? Hi. Sorry to disturb you. Xiao-Hong. Where were you last night? - It's okay. - It's okay? I asked you where you went. It's okay. I'm tired. I want to sleep. I don't care if you're tired. Where did you go? Xiao-Hong. Meiling. What? Ting-Ting said that a few days ago, she was working late at the hospital and she saw Xiao-Hong. What a coincidence. Yes, what a coincidence. She also said Xiao-Hong was with a friend. Maybe it was his new girlfriend, Lele. That girl... She's really nice. So have you met his girlfriend? Not yet. Why? Why do you care so much? Hello? Xiao-Hong. Are you at work? Yes. Ms. Lele. Is everything okay? I'm in kind of a bad mood. Can you come keep me company? Of course. Where are you now? I'm at the hotel. Okay. I'll go over now. Okay. See you soon. See you soon. Hold on. On your way over, can you buy some beer? Okay. Sure. Thank you. Bye. Your call has gone directly to voicemail. Leave a message after the beep. Welcome. Where is Xiao-Hong? What are you doing here? Where is Xiao-Hong? He left work early today. He left work? Why? To go where? I don't know. You really don't know? I really don't know. You really don't know? You really don't know? I... Xiao-Hong. Thank you for being with me. What? Ms. Lele. Do you want to dance? Sure. Where is Xiao-Hong? Where is Xiao-Hong? Who are you? I'm his mom! Hello? That's my mom! Can I help you? Where's Xiao-Hong? Xiao-Hong? I see your backpack... Xiao-Hong? So you're Lele? I am. So what? What's wrong with you? - Mom, what's the matter? - Madam, you need to calm down. Who are you calling madam? You don't get to call me that! Shameless woman! You seduce my son! - Now you're insulting me? - Yes, I'm insulting you! So what? - Let's go home. - Mom... Just go home. Do you know what this place is? I had to hear from Madam Liu. It's humiliating! Mom, please stop yelling. I'll yell if I want to! Let's go home. Mom... Please go home, okay? So do you want to hurt me? What would your dad think of this? It's not like that. Then come home with me. I don't want to. You'd better not regret this. Madam, we have to follow the procedure. No! You have to go there right now. The police have to crack down on this. My son is still over there! We'll follow the standard procedure, but your son not coming home sounds like a domestic issue! What kind of attitude is that? I want to speak to the captain! Madam. You can't just see the captain when you want to. Fine. Just wait and see. Wu! Meiling? Why weren't you at rehearsal today? I'm sorry, Ms. Lele. That's just how my mom is. She has always been protective of me. Maybe it's because she has taken such care of you that you're such a good kid and so sweet. I don't know. What on earth? Darn it! This is all your fault. Weijie. Stop playing innocent. Your mom called the police. Ms. Lele. I'm sorry. I didn't know my mom called the police. It's okay. It's not your fault. Let's go. Why isn't it his fault? That's enough. I see. Your boyfriends are getting younger and younger. That's enough! You treat everyone better than me! Stop it! Wang Weijie! What kind of mom are you? You'd better not let me see you again. Or I'll beat you again. Are you okay? That was when I was still a kid. Ms. Lele. I'm sorry. Stop apologizing. You didn't do anything wrong. I love you. Ms. Lele. Are you okay? You should go home. Don't come and see me anymore. Why? What did I do wrong? You didn't do anything wrong. It's my fault. I was lonely and I wanted some company. I'm sorry. Xiao-Hong! What happened to your face? You're injured... Why did you go to the police? You know you got Ms. Lele arrested? She deserved it! She's awful! No, you're awful! No, you're awful! No, you're awful! I'm begging you, stay out of my life! Xiao-Hong! Ms. Hsu, this way please. Are you okay? Why are you so down? Look at the fish... You're depressing them too. They're all bummed out. I didn't mean to. Weijie. It's Mom. Are you there? How did you know I live here? I asked your dad. This place is just temporary. I had a much bigger place, but the landlord took it back... I paid back the money that you owe. They won't bother you again. You paid it off? Where did you get the money? I took out a loan on my apartment. I was thinking I could sell my apartment and rent a bigger place. Would you want to come live with me? Why aren't you eating? I'm not hungry. Are you a martyr now? You're not eating? Can I help you? I'm sorry. I'm looking for Ms. Lele. She doesn't work here anymore. What? Really? Yes. But I can help if you want. What type of girl would you like? I can arrange it for you. That's okay. Thank you. Hey! I have something for you. Hold on. This is from Ms. Lele. For me? Yes. You finally lost your virginity? Xiao-Hong, thank you for saving my fish. I'm looking for Ms. Lele. My mom is not here. Is Ms. Lele moving? Yes. We're moving. It's none of your business. Xiao-Hong. Are you okay? You can stop here. We'll perform tomorrow night. I'll spend a few days walking around Tainan. Okay. Don't be so upset, okay? You'll be fine. Bye. Meiling. Hello. Your son... Is he okay? He's okay. He learned his lesson. So did I. Excuse me. The goldfish I bought all died. It has only been a month. What? I don't know why they all died. Did I put too many rocks in the tank? I'm sorry. I can give you some new ones. Really? Wait a second. Okay. Is your insomnia any better? What? Your insomnia... Are you sleeping better? Yes. Thank you.
