NO! Please no! What happened? He's been under a lot of stress it was just finally too much for him. NO! Please Daddy, NO! In 1935, Dr. Dexter uncovered what has become known as The Pnakotic Manuscripts a series of scrolls that detail what some researchers believe is a history of a civilized race that predates humanity. While the Manuscript itself is under lock and key at The Dexter Estate, we have fragments of the manuscript here at Miskatonic's own library. Sweet But don't get too excited; they're in the Forbidden Lore room, and we all know how difficult it is to gain access. Now, we've had some of the world's foremost authorities on Primitive Religions visit to study them. A good reference easily accessible to you is Blake's "AStudy of the Pnakotic Manuscripts", and that is available here at Miskatonic's own library - and all you need is a student ID to check it out. Can I help you, miss? I hope so. I'm assuming from the slide that this is Primitive Religions? That's right. I'm Asenath Waite. I just transferred from Innsmouth. Asenath Waite. You're Ephraim's daughter. Uh listen, more tomorrow on The Pnakotic Manuscripts, so do your reading. Your father was my mentor. He was instrumental in shaping my career. I know. My father wrote of his assistants frequently in his journals. Although you weren't exactly given a glowing review... I believe his words were tirelessly mediocre. Well. I was sad to hear of his passing. Class starts at nine-oh-five, Miss Waite. I look forward to it. I'm curious to see how much you've grown. What was that all about? - I don't know. Listen, I'm really interested in seeing those Pnakotic fragments. And I was wondering if you could sign me off for the Forbidden Lore room. I'll think about it, the Manuscripts are pretty intense. I'm not going to try anything. But I gotta write my thesis on something, and I'm interested in the mathematical code... Alleged mathematical code. That was Ephraim's theory, you know. The code. So...? I said I'd think about it. Hey there. Hi. Hi, Edward. Hi. Hey, Richie! What's up? He got an A on his math test today! Right on! I knew you could do it! Thanks to you. It's nice having a math genius for a tutor. (laughter) You forgot this. I know, thanks. What are we doing for dinner tonight? Steak tonight. Are you interested? Sounds great. Good. We'll see you around six then. Come on, you. See you tonight. - Bye Bye. - Bye Daddy! Bye Edward! Bye. Don't you have a class? Oh, shit! Uh, Okay, I'll see you later tonight. What was he like? Ephraim? Intense. Arrogant. Brilliant. He had a charisma about him, a way of getting people to do things that they didn't want to do. He was very respected when he came to Miskatonic... highly knowledgeable in the Pnakotic Code. He did his thesis on the Pnakotic Code, trying to prove a mathematical correlation between the Pnakotic language and symbols. Fascinating. I was lucky to be chosen as his assistant, along with another student, Robert Black. I got along well with Ephraim, but he connected with Black on a much deeper level. Black was a brilliant student... So what happened? One night Robert Black just decided to slaughter his entire family as they slept. His parents, his eight-year-old sister, his very elderly grandmother, who lived in the house with them. The rumor going around was that he tortured the grandmother for hours before she died. Jesus. Ephraim resigned shortly after that, with no real explanation. Black claimed no memory of the incident and was committed to Arkham Sanitarium. So what happened to Ephraim? He was put in Arkham as well. Asenath was raised by his live-in servant, I think. Some people think that Ephraim went crazy... ...from what he learned in the Pnakotic Manuscripts. Personally, I think the Manuscripts are hogwash, pseudo-science at best. I think you'd be better served writing your thesis on something different. You're not going to sign me off on the Forbidden Lore room. No. For your best interests, Edward. It's already been done. (laughter) Come on - Asenath. Come on - Asenath. It's a little unsettling the first time. Oh my God. Hey. Hey. What's going on? - Nothing. Asenath can do this really cool hypnotizing thing. She can make you think you're looking at yourself. It's wild! Really? It's just an illusion... parlor trick my dad taught me. Come on. Do it to him! No. Ah, come on. I want to see how this works. It's really difficult. What? I'm not susceptible to your charms? You can't do it to me? Alright. Okay. What do I do? Nothing. Just relax. Holy Shit! What the fuck?! Fuck me! Edward? What's going on? Nothing. I was just showing Edward a little illusion I learned. Yeah... it was nothing. Uh, just a little trick. Well, do you think you can get those books I asked for when you're done with your little trick? Yeah. I'm sorry. They're right here. Jeez, what's up his butt? No kidding. How did you do that? It's just an illusion. A kind of hypnosis. No way. That was no illusion! I was in your body... looking at my body. It's nothing, just something my father taught me. An old Pnakotic trick. I'm looking forward to reading your father's thesis. I was thinking about writing my own along similar lines. Upton won't teach you anything, will he? He won't let you go through the actual Manuscripts. He refers to it as pseudo-science. He thinks I'm wasting my time. That was always his problem... never believed, his disbelief made it impossible to... You know, my father made many contributions to this school. I have access to a lot of the forbidden books. You'd be able to view them whenever you wanted... if you were with me. Would you like to go out sometime? I thought you were going to show me something. Watch and learn. Ready? - For what? For this. Oh. My. God. Feels weird, doesn't it? Jesus. I had no idea. Can you teach me how? Doesn't work with everyone. And it takes a long time to learn. - How long did it take you? Twenty years. Bullshit. What, you started practicing in the womb? Maybe. Those things'll kill you. Or haven't you heard? Yeah. But I could always find a new body. Man, don't even say things like that. I could teach you this, and more. But you'd have to keep it a secret. Of course. - I mean it. Nobody can know. Especially Upton. Whatever you say. - Whatever I say? Now this would also suggest that Dagon played a prominent part in doctrines concerning death and future life. As to the ritual of his worship, little can be gathered from documents or scripture. Most of their records were destroyed with the rise of Christianity, and The Order of Dagon did not appear again. (cough) Yes, Miss Waite? That's not quite true. In the early nineteen hundreds, there was a revival of Dagon worshipping here in Massachusetts. I suppose you're referring to the events prior to the naval bombing of Innsmouth in the twenties. There's no evidence to support that Order had any ties to the original worshippers. Several scholars do believe that. In fact, it's been theorized that the bombing was a response to the cult activities. The bombing was a result of a federal crackdown on a huge organized crime-ring that had ties to Asian shipping magnates. The Order of Dagon - if it even existed - was a front for laundering stolen artifacts. You can research all of this in Gilman's excellent "Shadows Over Innsmouth". Rubbish. Gilman's account was clearly a cover-up. Most historians are unaware of the inconsistencies between his story and the events as they transpired. You act as if you were there, Miss Waite. Whatever happened, happened over eighty years ago. Would you ask me to believe that someone born sixty-some-odd years after the fact has a clearer interpretation than someone who survived the events? Okay. For next week I want everyone ready for the test on South Pacific religions. Sarah wanted me to invite you to dinner tonight. It's been weeks since you've been by... she's making some kind of a salmon-thing. I can't tonight. I've got plans. Tell her thanks, though. - Sure. (knocking) (knocking) Mr. Derby! Come on in! Clive, please. - Ok, Clive. I was hoping I could talk with you a bit, Professor. Well certainly, as long as we drop the professor and call me Dan. Listen Dan, I came to talk to you about Edward. Okay. Um, come on in. Is everything alright? You are aware of his relationship with the Waite girl? Asenath, yes... I... Did you know that they're getting married? What? No... I... You may have heard my wife's very ill, and this isn't helping. Asenath's father and I did not get along. I was on the board when he was forced to resign. I didn't know that. I was hoping you'd talk to him, maybe make him understand how foolish this is - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa - He respects you, he'll listen to you - I can't do that, he hasn't even told me that he's getting married yet- This is killing his mother. Okay. I'll talk to him, but you should know that we aren't as close as we were, ever since - Ever since he met her. She's taking over his life Dan. I'll talk to him. Ed, can I have a few moments? It'll only take a couple minutes. Okay. How yeah feeling, Ed? You look a little tired lately. I'm fine. Mid-Terms comin' up is all. How's everything else? Your Folks? How's your mom? She's fine... you know, good days and bad days. Yeah. How about you and Asenath? Everything all right there? Did my father tell you? He's just worried about you. I know. But he's projecting his feelings about Ephraim onto Asenath. Maybe you're rushing into things. I mean, you've only known each other for a month, and now you want to get married. Oh, fuck off. What? I'm so tired of your fucking meddling. You've never taken a risk in your life, you've never bothered to reach for anything beyond what you can touch with your own fingers, see with your own eyes. And here you are, cautioning me about rushing into things. As if you had any authority on the subject! I'll thank you to keep your nose out of my business, Upton! You don't want to cross me! Where am I? It is very dark here. I cannot see. Ephraim? It would appear so. Why are you here? I'm dreaming. I'm dead. Your friend will be coming soon. Edward? What do you mean? He will damn his knees at the Altar of Yog-Sothoth. You cannot save him. What is she doing to him? Nothing. I'm dead. You must leave. He's coming. Do you mean Edward? No. Him. (gunshot) Honey? What's wrong? Nothing. It's just a bad dream. What? - It's Edward. He's packing. What do you think you're doing? My father just called. You can't leave now. We're getting very close. Asenath, my mother... This isn't about your mother. You've lost your spine, boy. I just need to spend a little time with my family. I'll be back after my... afterwards. Of course. What was I thinking? You do what you have to do. We still have plenty of time. Call me if you need anything, please? I will. Thank you, As. Meet me in the library. Perfect. You gettin' in or what? I forgot something. One moment, alright? Meter's running. Thank you, Mrs. Babson. Edward. Why are you knocking? (gunshots) Edward? What are you doing? (gunshots) Oh, Edward. You had us so worried for a moment there. What? I don't... You passed out just as the taxi was arriving. Scared us all half to death! Serious bit of flu, the doctor said. My father called... Yes, I called him after we got you in the house, he said not to worry, they'll catch up with you again soon. Right now you need to concentrate on getting better. Dale, still no leads in the brutal double-murder... ...that shook Arkham's residents last week. Today finds stunned family and friends here, at Arkham Cemetery, where the funeral for Clive and Miriam Derby has just ended. Hi, honey. Hey. How was the funeral? Very sad. Well, believe it or not, he wasn't here. I know. He hasn't been at school all week, well... that's understandable. I'm going to go in and check in on him. Okay. I'll see you in a bit. Bye. (knocking) (knocking) What do you want? Uh hi. Is Edward here? - No. Uh, how about Asenath? No. They're both gone. They won't be back for quite a while. I'll tell them you stopped by. What's all the racket up here? Please, Asenath, let me out. No, let me out of here... Let me out of here... Bitch! Dan was right about you all along! Upton's an idiot. And you, you're a fool. God, you disgust me. Why doesn't Edward come around anymore? He's very busy now. Edward just got married, and he doesn't have as much time as he used to. Is he mad at me? Of course he's not mad at you! Why would you say that? The little girl said Edward was gonna hurt me. What? What little girl? The girl with the funny coat. Well what girl? What's her name? I don't know. Well, you find out. Never mind, I'm going to find out, I'll go talk to your teacher tomorrow. Okay? Now... you go to sleep. And no more... no more silly talk. Okay? I love you. Love you too. Well you better. I'll see tomorrow, okay? Okay - Good night. We're going to have to have a talk with Richie's principal. Some girl at school is telling stories to scare him. I mean, I know kids are kids and all that, but we gotta nip this in the bud. You know, it starts out as nothing, he starts having nightmares, then he starts wetting the bed, and before you know it... he's up on the water tower with a rifle, taking potshots at joggers. So, do you want to talk, or...? Jesus Christ, keep it down! Richie's just upstairs yeah know! Holy shit. What brought that on? Did you like that? Oh yeah. It was incredible. We haven't done that since... We've never done that. Did you like that? Well, you know... What's the phrase again, Upton? Oh yeah: Tirelessly mediocre. What? What did you just say to me? (laughter) Lately though, some scholars suggest that the Canaanites may have confused two different moon gods, and that Jarih is completely different from Erah, although both were worshipped as lunar deities. So, for tomorrow I want chapter eight read, and expect discussion. And also, your papers are due on The Esoteric Order of Dagon. Jesus, Edward! Are you alright? You have some forms you'll have to fill out here, Sir. Edward, come on let's go. God Dan, I was there, at the Pit of the Shoggoths! I told her I wasn't ready, I told her I didn't want to do it anymore, but she took my body! Down the six-thousand steps! She was right there the whole time! I didn't believe her, I mean, who would? But it's out there, waiting... Waiting for someone to wake it up... Edward... I took it back, and I found myself there, and I ran. Something chased me Dan, a Shoggoth, I'm sure of it! She's getting stronger... I hope you'll forget my attack back there, Upton. I'm afraid my mind hasn't really gotten over the shock of it all, and I find myself imagining all sorts of terrible things. I've been under a tremendous amount of stress lately, And please disregard any crazy things I may have been saying about my wife or things in general. That's what comes with overstudying a field like mine. Please don't blame Asenath, she's really a very understanding woman. I really appreciate this lift home. No problem. EDWARD!!!! So, is Edward coming back, after all that's happened? Yeah. I don't expect him back for some time. Really? Okay. Perhaps he was disgusted by the substandard levels of teaching in this school. In this class in particular. Maybe he wasn't comfortable working with a rapist. How's your wife, Upton? What the hell is going on here? You! You're behind this! I don't know what you're talking about. I'm only here to tell you Edward and I will not be returning to class. We're leaving Miskatonic. Good-bye, Upton. You shouldn't be here. Asenath? Yes. Why are you here? He put me here. I've been here for a long time. If you're not careful, he'll put you here too. Who? Edward? Why? Yog-Sothoth commands him now, and he is eager to rise again. He is the gate, and the others will follow. I don't know what that means. You might be able to save your friend, but you can't do it alone. Maybe he can help you. (knocking) (knocking) (knocking) (knocking) Jesus Christ. Alright already! Edward! Can I come in? Of course! What's going on? I don't know where to start. I had a huge fight with Asenath. She's gone for good. Just packed up and headed back to Innsmouth. Jesus, Ed... uh... I don't know what to say. Well, how about congratulations? She was stealing my body, Dan! What are you saying? At first it was kind of fun, we would switch places and nobody could tell the difference. But then she started doing it when I wasn't ready, crowding me out, locking me in the house while she went out with my body! Please Ed, you're beginning to sound like a tourist. You can't believe what you're saying. One minute I was riding in the car with you, and the next I was locked in the library at our house! You must have ridden with her the rest of the way home. Couldn't you tell the difference? Why... I mean, how could she be able to do something like that? It doesn't make any sense. There are people who can do things nobody should be able to do. She belongs to a cult, Dan. They worship a being called Yog-Sothoth. They believe that when the stars are right he can be summoned by one of his priests... and he can be used as a gate between the two worlds. That's what they were trying to do when I escaped from the Pit! Edward, you're exhausted. You just need a good night's sleep. You don't believe me? Why do they need you for all of this? I mean why are you so important for this summoning? Because I'm starting to understand the science! Ephraim was absolutely right! It's not supernatural! It's not Magic! It's just a different science rooted in a different reality. I can't believe it took so long to figure out! Dan, it's all in the Pnakotic Manuscripts! It's all right there! And, besides, Arkham's history has proven itself... ...to be a focal point for strange happenings! Okay, enough. Let's get you to bed. We can talk about it in the morning. No way... No way... (phone rings) (phone rings) Hello? Dan? It's Edward. Hey. How are you feeling? Much better. I just wanted to say thanks for letting Me stay at your place last night. I know I said some crazy stuff, and I appreciate you not freaking out on me. Well, you've been under a lot of stress lately, what with your parents... I know. I know. My parents... and Asenath, you can go ahead and say it. Look, she really screwed me up for awhile, but that's all passed. She won't bother me anymore, Dan. I've made sure of that. Yeah. Yeah, I think I will. Maybe tomorrow. Good. Well, take your time, there's need to rush things. Right. Thanks, Dan. For everything. Come back here when you're ready. We'll see you soon. Okay. Bye. - Bye-Bye. (phone rings) (phone rings) You've reached the Upton residence, please leave a message. (beep) Hi Dan, this is Edward. I'm really not feeling up to coming in today, Still a little punch-drunk from everything that's happened lately. I'll try to make it in later in the week. Bye. Edward? Ugh... Damnit! Edward... Hello? Edward? It's Dan... is everything alright? Edward, are you ok? Shut up! Edward? What is it? Dan! What are you doing here? I was worried about you. I mean... Edward, what are you doing? God Dan, it's pulling, tugging in my brain! She's trying to come back. Asenath? Is she calling you? Has she been trying to... She's whispering things to me, scratching at the back of my mind, she's trying to get back in. She just won't give up... Look, we can have this taken care of. We can go to the police, get a restraining order or something... come on. Beyond body... beyond life! Nothing can stop it... not even death. It's good that you brought him. We can sedate him, make sure he gets a couple nights good rest. I didn't know what else to do. You did the right thing. Once he's calm and lucid, I'd like to run some tests, see if we can't determine what caused this situation. From what you describe, it sounds like simple mental exhaustion. That's usually attributed to stress, and it sounds like he's been under quite a bit. Mr. Upton? Are you feeling alright? I knew this man. I went to school with him. I knew this man. I went to school with him. Would it be alright if I spoke with him? Mr. Upton, I don't think that's wise. He's not the person you knew. Please. I think he'd speak to me. Robert? You have a visitor. Do you remember your friend Dan? Yeah. She told me you'd be coming. Who told you, Robert? You know who. Doctor, would it be alright if we spoke in private? Is it okay if Dan talks to you? You can say no. It's fine. Like I said, I've been expecting him. Two minutes, Mr. Upton. No more. Thank you. I've been dreaming about you. Yeah. Me too. It's all jumbled, and I don't really know what's going on. But... you need help... your friend needs help. Yeah, but I don't see how you can help me from inside here. Upton, you never believed... that was your problem. And your salvation, maybe. Maybe if I hadn't believed, I wouldn't be here right now. But... it's time to let go of all that skepticism. Because... whether you believe it or not... it's real. It's not magic or sorcery. It's just science and it's real. It's all... math... man Is there some way to stop her? What? You think I just did all this for fun? How do you think I've kept myself safe all these years? If she can do this, why hasn't she tried it on me? I don't know. Maybe you've got some kind of natural psychic defense. Maybe your skepticism somehow made you immune. Doesn't really matter, does it? I... - Shut up. You only have two minutes. There are books at the school that can help you. Formulae and symbols. The Pnakotic Manuscripts, The Book of Yog-Sothoth, De Vermis Mysteriis. Stay away from the Necronomicon. It can't help you. Mr. Upton? Okay. Thank you. Good luck. You're going to need it. Will you do what must be done? I don't know if I can. The formula is too complex, I can't tell if I'm doing it right. You're not. It's too late now, anyway. But I've done what you said. I talked to Black, he showed me what to do. Too little, too late. I can't help you now. I don't know how to stop her. What am I supposed to do? No, there's another way. I just need to figure out the formula! Yog-Sothoth is The Gate. If The Gate is opened, The Others will come through. You must stop him from opening The Gate. Now do you understand? (phone rings) (phone rings) Hello? Edward? No... Dan, it's Sarah. Are you alright? Yeah. Uh, what's going on? It's Richie. He's had a really bad dream. He's pretty upset, and he'll only talk to you. Sure. Put him on. Dad? Hey champ. Can't sleep? Nightmares? I dreamed you were talking to Uncle Edward, and something really bad happened to him! Dad? Dad? Are you there? Yeah. I'm here. Uh... That was just a nightmare. You know that buddy. Must be watching those scary movies again, huh? It didn't feel like a dream. Shh. It's just a dream. Put your mom back on. Okay. I miss you. I miss you too, buddy. Hey. I know things haven't been that great since that night, and I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. Anyway, um... I'll call you tomorrow. Dan. I'm scared. I feel like something really bad is going to happen. Nah. Everything's fine. You'll see, we'll get through this. Okay? Alright. I love you. I love you too. Bye. (phone rings) Hello? - Hello. It's Dr. Russel at the institute. Dr. Russel! Is everything alright? Everything's fine. In fact, I'm calling to tell you That I've been talking with Edward, and he seems to be recovering. I'd like to keep him for observation for a few days, But if you'd like to visit him today, you certainly may. That's great news. I'll be there shortly. Wonderful... Good-bye. Bye. Too little, too late my ass. Mr. Upton! Edward will be so pleased to see you. He's asked for you repeatedly. Yes. Doctor, how is Robert Black? I'm sorry, Mr. Upton. Robert passed away in the night in his sleep. I'm told he went peacefully, there was no pain. Oh. Jesus. Here we are. Upton. Good of you to come! Things were a bit rough there for a while, but as you can see, I'm feeling much better now. These past few days have taught me much. I'd love to discuss it with you once I'm released. And do say hello to Sarah and Richard for me. I'm ready to leave now. (phone rings) (phone rings) Hello? (peculiar noise) Hello? (dial tone) (thunder) (dial tone) (knock) (light knock) (light knock) (light knock) (light knock) (light knock) (light knock) (light knock) (bell) Asenath? What happened? What's going on? Do you need a doctor? Dan, By now you must realize that everything I've told you is true, And perhaps even suspect what it took so long for me to figure out. It wasn't Ephraim who died in that cell ten years ago - He had switched bodies with his daughter, Ensuring he would live long enough to see his unholy Summoning completed. I lied when I said she left me. I killed her. I had to! The time of the Summoning was near, and she was becoming too powerful. I was in my right body, and she let her guard down. I shot her. (gunshot) But I could feel her trying to worm back into my mind from beyond death, And last night I found myself trapped in her corpse. I can't talk, but I can still write. I'll get this letter to you somehow. Go to the asylum and kill it - It is not your friend anymore! If you don't, he will complete the summoning using my body. You've been a good friend. I'm sorry I dragged you into this. I'll be at peace soon. Edward. Asenath, I... Edward? No. This is some kind of sick joke Mr. Upton! Hey. Do you think it would be alright if I spoke with Edward for a minute. It's a little late for visiting hours. I know. It would only take a minute, and it's really important. Don't tell anybody, though - you could get me in trouble! Oh... I won't. Five minutes, Mr. Upton - I mean it. Thank you. Can't sleep, Upton? Nightmares? You're too late, you know. Your friend is dead, and all of your amateurish preparations could not prevent what has been foretold for centuries. And what is that? The coming of Yog-Sothoth. He is The Gate in which the Old Ones will return to our dimension. I'm not going to let that happen. God, Upton. You're so predictable. As the hour draws nearer, this body is imbued with the power of Yog-Sothoth. I cannot be stopped. HE cannot be stopped! You're a weak-minded fool, Upton. You always were. Surprised, Upton? Of course you are. Your tiny mind never could comprehend the power of the Old Ones. But now I see that you have the look of a true believer, no longer my Doubting Thomas - Upton. Upton, let go, this world has no place for you. No! What have you done? Goodbye, Ephraim. (gunshots) Look, I know the story is unbelievable. If you just dig a little deeper, I'm sure that you'll find things that point to the truth. Oh we have... dug a little deeper, Mr. Upton. The dead body we found in your house is indeed Asenath Waite. And she was shot and killed... ...with the same unregistered gun you used on your friend Edward. Interestingly enough, that same gun was used on Edward's parents last month. Look, Upton. We know you've been having problems lately. Your wife has recently moved out of the house. There was a blow up at several students in the classroom. All the writing on the windows in your home... And your star student suddenly gets married and leaves school. Am I detecting a little jealousy, Upton... hmm? So you decide to kill everybody that's keeping him away from you? Is that what happened? Jesus. Get him out of here. Richie! Daddy - Richard Little buddy, everything's going to be fine. Daddy, what's going to happen to you? What are they going to do? No, no, everything's gonna be fine. I'm going to be fine. As soon as we get this all straightened out, I'll be home soon. You really think after you killed Edward and his parents and his wife they're going to let you walk free? Ah well, you never really were that smart, Upton. In fact, you've always been just... tirelessly mediocre. Get out of my son, you bastard. Get out of my son, Ephraim! Get out of my son, you son of a bitch!!! NO!!!! NO!!
