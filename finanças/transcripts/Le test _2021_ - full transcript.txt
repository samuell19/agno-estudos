I forgot to tell you. Noah did a drawing of the whole family last week. All four members... even the dog. Incredible, right? At his age, drawing fur with such detail, it's amazing! Did I tell you Antoine saw a therapist, to evaluate his abilities? Oh, really? He has the mental age of a 4-year-old. Isn't Antoine already 4? No. 3 years and 3 months. At that age, the difference is huge. I didn't get it why he never listened, why nothing interested him. He's simply too mature. Not interested, so he gets bored. My little Noah is just the same! - It'll do him good to skip a grade. - Absolutely. The therapist never said "precocious", but he said: "I've never seen a case like this". Well, not exactly that. He said: "I've rarely seen a case like this." Or "I haven't had many cases like this". Anyways, can't remember but he... - How's your daughter's bulimia? - Constance? - Yeah. - She's not bulimic. Her condition is known as bulimia. No. Bulimia's an illness. Constance listens to her body, it's different. I've read loads of articles, serious studies... In fact, it's just like cats. She needs to vomit to self-regulate. Marion Cotillard has the same issue. Really? Marion Cotillard makes herself vomit? All the time! I talk about it on my blog. I did see her in a magazine recently, she does have a beautiful complexion. She listens to her body. It's important. - Next. - Good evening, Jean Luc. Hi, Helen. How are you? Please, you first, Annie. Laurent could help her bulimia. - Nah, it's not bulimia! - Yes it is! - Nah... - I'm sorry but it's bulimia! Antoine wasn't born in January... - He was born in March. - Beginning of March. - Yes, the 14th. - That's right. The 14th isn't beginning of March. It isn't the 30th either. I was hoping it would be possible... No, I'm sorry. Not possible, Mrs. Castillon. Please understand, if I put every student born in March in the section above, as if they were born in January, the ones born in April will complain. So I'll have to add them too. Then I'd have to put all the preschool kids in the year above. No point in having different levels. But since the therapist said... - Antoine was particularly bright. - Yes, so... Therapists say what they want... I'm sorry, nothing personnel. Yes, of course. But don't you want to look at his ability test report? Yeah sure. Sorry, but there are people waiting. These are nice! Helen, it's your turn! Hi, Jean Luc. That's so kind. - You shouldn't have. - My pleasure. Thank you for your time... And I left you the test report. Have a look it's well detailed, very well done. - I left you my number too. - Sure. Asshole. I'm not finished with him. He's in for a surprise. - Hi, Gaspard! - You ok, Annie? Hello! What a fucking asshole. Oh my! What an asshole! - He refused? - He said no. Forget it, he's an asshole. Asshole! Don't say that! Asshole! Antoine, what did I say? Don't say that. You took another appointment? - Yes, in three weeks. - Asshole! No, Antoine, don't say that. Fucking asshole. Asshole! Antoine, stop it. Mom, drop me off first, please? No, we've established an order. First it's me, then Poppy, then you. - If we start... - But Juliette's boat is leaving! - Max, you're a pain! - Yeah but... No can do... And the Mayor is expecting me. Mom's not at your beck and call. Fine, Max, I get it. Could you drop me off before Poppy? - What? No way! - Yes, fine. - Let's do that. - Perfect, thanks. So, nobody cares about me. That's not it, bunny, but you don't mind. Serves you right! Your teacher is always late anyway. Can you find a ride back home? Yeah, no worries. See you later. - See you. - Bye. Bye! - Hi, Max! - Hey! Excuse me, hi. THE TEST Thanks, Max. Can you stop here, please? - Thanks. - You sure she won't mind? No, it's romantic. - Meet me at the parking lot afterwards? - No worries, I know. - Love you. - Love you. It's not romantic, it's lame. It's cute. C'mon, please! Stop playing with them! Hello. Cesar? - How are you? - Fine and you? Chill. Am I disturbing you? No, it's ok. They're just pissing me off! Driving me crazy, running around like that! Stop running now! Fucking hell! It's our 3-year anniversary today, remember? Oh yeah, right. Yeah! Crazy, isn't it? You need help? - Nope. Really, please, it's fine. - You don't need my help? - Nope, all good. - Ok, fine. Wait, you're ready? Give me 10 sec to do a video. - Yeah ok. - Ok, wait. Ready! A little kiss. Yeah. - You smell of fry-up, no? - I smell... Guys, you're really pissing me off! Come here now! - No! - Stop running! Don't talk back! - Hurry, the boat is leaving. - C'mon hurry! Wait, Juliette? Yes. Just a sec. Strike a pose. Act like a sailor. - Is this ok? - Yeah, perfect. I'm off. Love you. Love you. - You guys ready? - Yeah. Juliette? Yeah. Can you hold the bar, please? Raise your hand and act like... - No, c'mon. - The bar in front of you. - Yeah there. - It's going to make me puke. Just raise your arm... Yeah, like that. - Crazy! - Is this ok? Totally. - Kisses. - Kisses. Cut! - Say goodbye to Cesar. - Bye-bye. Bye. I love you! - Kisses. - You know I can't come with you. I have a council meeting. You'll be ok? Yeah, it's okay, don't worry. - Poppy? - Yeah? Did you take your leotard? No, Mom, it's way too ugly. Make an effort. It cost me a bomb! - Please, I have a nicer one in my bag. - No, really. Seriously, Mom! Please. Ok... Hi! Hey! - I'm super late. - As always. Nice leotard. Really? Yeah, it's beautiful. Seriously? Yeah, it's really... flowery. Are you taking the piss? It sucks! It's the best costume ever. - Stop the bullshit. - Nice, right? Yeah. I thought it was ugly. I must have shitty tastes. Why are you laughing? - Don't you like it? - Well, no! Don't be such a fool. It's so ugly. Why did I believe you? Anyways, we all look ridiculous. Look at Esther with her little fish. You can talk! Yours is ok with its flames! Stylish. But, look... Ah! Damn! Hello everyone! Let's regroup please, come closer. - How are you all? - Fine. - Yeah? Your ankle? - Yeah. First of all, I wanted to say, the outfits look great! I love them! Well done, Moms! Especially your flower. - It's so cute Poppy, I love it. - So it seems. What? - Nothing, sorry. - No... I know you're all ready girls... and boys for Sunday's competition. Unfortunately, like I've said, we can only have a team of 5. Those selected are... Esther. Cleo and Chloe, no surprise there. Noisette. And Na√Øma. Well done, girls! Get in line. Chloe and Cleo take the lead as usual. I know you're disappointed, but there will be other competitions. - This one's crucial, think of the team. - But we worked so hard! - Yeah, that's great. - We busted our balls off. - And our costumes! - They're nice. You'll wear them next time. Now, warm-up on the side please, ok? Ready? - Bitch. - What? Nothing. Let's warm up anyways. We're not on vacation. Nice and wide! Yes! - I'm going to talk to your coach. - No, Mom, please. - Are you sure? - Yeah, it's a shame. If you don't get your chance after having trained hard for weeks... That's a problem! Feet off the seat! Here comes our driver. So, was Juliette happy to see you? Yeah, it was great! Go straight ahead. Pass the Center and come back. That way we go for a little spin. Really? Can we go somewhere that way for once? This is going somewhere. Ok... Forget anything? Oh, damn it! Seatbelts on? Yes. Mom, I'm so tired of parking lots. Can't we go on the road? - Like normal people? - You're different. Look your 10:10 isn't even right. You're not ready. - Careful with the car ahead. - I'm sorry it's 10:10. Careful! Hit the brakes! See, on the road, that would've been an accident. Start the car, we're blocking everyone. Yes. Your brother wasn't such a pain. He didn't make a fuss of everything. Are you serious? He failed 5 times and gave up. You traumatized him. - That's true. - And it's my fault? I don't have to sacrifice all my weekends for you. - No. - No, nobody's forcing you to. No... Look, let me show you. For the breaks, I push on P for park. That's all you have to do. I'm just saying that for you. Hey, is the trunk going to empty itself? I'll let you lock up. It's busy. - Hello, Mrs. Guibelini. - Hello. It's occupied. Fuck... - Yes? - Can I come in? Damn stomach flu. - I love my job. - Look. What's that? Well, look. It's not mine. I just found it. Ok. Where did you find it? In the bathroom trash. So what? So what? No! Whose is it? I don't know, why are you asking me? Probably one of my patient's... They all wander into the house. Laurent, you're a geriatrician. I don't know then. It can't be Poppy, can it? Poppy? No, she's barely started her periods. Can we do a blood test? - DNA Test? - No, it won't work. Why? There's no DNA in urine. - Are you sure? - Yes. Can we talk later, ok? Maybe it's Juliette? Where's my Wednesday Pilates class? Did Mom cancel it? How do I change it? You can't. Mom's the administrator. Mom, did you cancel my Pilates? - You have a test the next day. - Yes but... - Cesar. - Yeah? - Is this yours? - What? That's disgusting. Mom, you peed on it? Oh, you're pregnant? No! - Cesar, can you call Juliette please? - Why? She spends all her time here. Maybe it's hers. - Well, yeah. - Do you think so? She would have told me. We protect ourselves. - Call her. - What about Poppy? - Stop talking nonsense. - Let me see, Mom. No. This isn't Poppy. - It's Juliette's. - Stop, Mom! This isn't yours, is it? What's that? Fucking disgusting. I can't believe it! Max! Stop it! Don't play with that! She's on her scout trip with no phone. This can ruin your future. Do you realize that? What future? Prep school, University! Your internship in Toronto? You can't go if you have a baby! I didn't even know those were my plans! - You want end up like Peschard's son? - Mom? When was the test done? I need to know. Max, please, let us talk. Ok, it's maybe mine. - Ok, fine! - What? Call your girlfriends then. Did you call CSI Miami? Cesar doesn't want to call Juliette. I can't! She's out on a trip for the 2nd time! Ok, so I'll do my own investigation. I can always call Myriam. Who's Myriam? - Juliette's mother. - Yes, call her. No, you're not calling Myriam! I shouldn't tell you guys anything, and do like Max! What does that mean? He doesn't mention his girlfriends and you let him be. Max has never had a girlfriend! If he had, we would know! He studies romantic literature and plays in a symphonic orchestra. And takes Pilates classes. You think it's just a coincidence? He's always surrounded by women. That's because he's... sensitive. Unique... Yes, that's it. Of course. I sent out a message to everyone. I'm waiting for them to respond, but nothing yet. So, normally... It can't be her... but we'll find out tonight. Her, I don't think she'll answer. But the others will. - Then her... - Ok. Come with me. - Where do you want to go? - C'mon. Where are we going? Mom? We don't have to do this, she'll call back. - We're here now, we're going in. - No, Mom! Plus she's working! We can't go in! - No, Max, we're doing this! - No! No! Ok, fine! I'll go. You're a pain! She sure is... No, he's bluffing for sure! Or he's making an appointment. He may be bluffing, but she's hot. No, he's bluffing, for sure. They seem to know each other well. I'm sorry but this is a set up! Did you see that? - Laurent, did you see that? - No, but... It's not sure anyways. Ok, it's not her. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - Absolutely sure. - Wait... She's been to our house? Yeah, several times. And so you... I mean... Ok, let's go! Are there more? Yeah, a few. What's wrong? Nothing... - You're sure it's the last one? - Yes. Not this one, it's the next. - Here? - Yeah, right here. Just here! Shit, her parents are in. - Good. I'll talk to them. - No, I'll go. Discrete mode. No way. House is pretty nice! - What did he say the parents do? - They're oncologists. What's their names? Maybe I know them. Quiet Laurent! - Who is it? - Hey there! Max? Who are they? Good evening. My parents. What do they want? We have a question please, if you don't mind. I'll be right there. Cool. She's super nice. Don't embarrass me. What's she doing? - That's super dangerous. - She's used to it. It's amazing. - Good evening. - Hey! - How are you? - I'm fine. - It's great seeing you. - Yes! I called but you didn't answer. I'm in "Do not disturb" mode. Ok, so... are you pregnant? No. Why? - You're sure? - Yeah, I would have told you. - Ok. - This is not yours? You kept it in your pocket? - I washed it! - It's not mine. I don't use that brand. What do you mean this brand? I use the pink one. - It's faster. - You use lots of pregnancy tests? I haven't counted but... Does June use this brand? Dunno. Ask her. - Can you ask her please? - Yeah. Cool. June? Who's June? - Her sister. - June! She lives here? - June! - Obviously, it's her sister, Laurent. - Oh Max! - Hey! You ok? - What are you doing here? - Are you pregnant? - What? - Pregnant! No. Ok. Laurent, what are you doing? - What? - What are you doing? I'm coming! So who's next, Max? So, there's no more? - What about your Pilates class? - No, all's ok. Your teacher is good looking. No, Mom, not my teacher. She's good looking. Yes, I know. What about at University? University? No. - It's all good there. - And the conservatory? No, not the conservatory... - Oh shit. - What? Shit! Constance... - What did he say? - Constance. - Constance? - Constance. Constance... Oh fuck... - Who is she? - I'm sorry. Oh no, Max, you're a pain! - I didn't do it on purpose. - Of course you didn't. - It's her! - Who is Constance? You were supposed to take music lessons? We did but there was... a small misunderstanding... What do you mean a misunderstanding? I don't get it here! I'm so sorry. - Do you realize what you've done? - Put yourself in my shoes... No seriously, you're a real a pain! - Actually... - No, you're a pain! - Couldn't help it. - Answer! Who is she? - You can't keep it under control? - I didn't do it on purpose. Yeah, right. This just fell on you? I can't believe this! - I'm sorry, Mom. - Ah, you're sorry. That's enough now! Stop it! Constance... - I'm sorry... - Who is it? I still don't see who she is. Ok, go! Don't you want to go instead? - You're kidding, right? - No. Since you know her, it'll be easier... It's precisely because I know her that - I'm not going! - At least, can you come with me? - No, Max! - Mom, please! - I'm not going. - No, we are going. Let's go! You're a real pain. Thanks. Ring the doorbell. Noah! Stop barking when the doorbell rings. - Annie? - Hi, Helen! Hi. You ok? What's going on? Sorry to disturb you so late. - You know, Laurent? - Of course, good evening. - Good evening. How are you? - Hi Max, you ok? - Hi. - So tell me... We have a problem, Helen. Make it quick, I'm putting the baby to bed. Little genius isn't in bed yet? Noah, no! Leave the lily alone. No, I'm sorry. He's so bright he gets bored. I have to give him medication. He's decompressing, it's normal. What kind of medication? American medication. So, tell me... What's going on? We think Constance might be pregnant. I found a positive pregnancy test in the bathroom. Max told us that... Well... they... I mean... with Constance so... That's not possible. Right? Not with Constance. Impossible. I'm so sorry. You were supposed to play music! That's what I said! You were supposed to play music! Don't worry, Helen, we'll get through this together. Laurent knows a lot of specialists. - Laurent? - Yes. - Yes. - Sure, yes. Constance! - What? - Come here, dear, please. What's going on? - Max? - Hey. Honey, you know I'm here, right? Ok? You know you can talk to me? Yeah? About what? Why has Annie found a pregnancy test in her bathroom trash? - But hum... - Do you realize what that means? The end of high school, your trip to Tokyo... Why are you telling me this? How long ago was it? I can't remember... - Be precise, Max. - Yes, think. But I'm not pregnant! - You sure? - Yes! Since your Mom said you've been throwing up lately... She's self-regulating, that's normal! What do you mean self-regulating? - What? You told her? - It's just a question, Constance. You tell others about me? - C'mon, don't take it like that. - Why did you do that? - Please. - It's none of your business! Hey! No! Why did you do that? - You are such a fucking pain! - Constance, a bit of respect! - Hey! - I hate you! I will not tolerate this behavior. We will talk later. I know you are there. - Don't stay on the computer all night. - Nah, don't worry. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Mom? - Yes? - Did you find out who it was? - No. But we'll find her. Ok. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Goodnight, Mom. Thanks for watching over Antoine. It was nothing. You're a great big sister. Would you tell me? What? Are you pregnant? No, Mom. - Goodnight, sweetheart. - Goodnight. Don't sleep too late. No, don't worry. What's wrong? Nothing. - Goodnight, Mom. - Goodnight. Were there any others? - Others? - Girls? No, don't worry. Ok, fine. Goodnight. Are you sure? We weren't like that at 19. - We weren't like that at 19. - Like what? Max. All this sleeping around. We can't complain. Look at Franck's daughter, Dora. She has tampon parties every weekend. He's thinking of sending her to boarding school. Tampon parties? Yes, tampon parties with her friends, they soak tampons in vodka and then they put it up their ass to party. Up their ass? Yes. That's how they get drunk and keep their breath fresh. We'll never ask her to babysit again. I'm going to bed. I miss the taste of your sex. Think of Peschard's son who is starting his day... That kid's an asshole. - Goodnight. - Yeah, won't be easy. It's our 3-year anniversary today, remember? - Oh yeah, right. - A little kiss. You smell of fry-up, no? Guys, you're really pissing me off! Come here now! Stop running! Don't talk back! You're seriously talking back? Just a sec. Strike a pose. - The bar in front of you. - It's going to make me puke. Just raise your arm! Yeah, like that. Done? You ok Joel? - There, yeah. - It's gonna make me puke! Just raise your arm! Yeah, just like that. Done? SYMPTOMS OF PREGNANCY: SIGNS YOU ARE PREGNANT PREGNANCY NAUSEAU - You smell of fry-up, right? - I smell... AN ACUTE SENSE OF SMELL (HYPERSOMNIA) Guys! Stop fucking running! Stop talking back! Get in the boat! It's the 6th time I've told you this! HYPERSENSITIVITY AND IRRITABILITY You're seriously talking back? Come here now! - I'm going to miss you. - Stop running, please! You're really pissing me off! - A kiss? - Yes. Hi guys! Do you know where Juliette is? The small path behind the tents. The path behind the tents? Ok... Sitting by the window I watch - The lonely souls... - Hi everyone! - Hello. - You ok, Juliette? - What are you doing here? - Come here. Sorry, Joel. I've been thinking. I love you. and I think I want to keep it. - I've been thinking too! - Yeah... So? Things are going too fast between us. I don't understand. First, you send too many texts... And your videos, why do all that? Dunno, to make you happy. If you don't like it, just say so. - It's not complicated. - And the joint calendar you did for us? You added an event "wedding 2024"! It was just for fun. I thought you'd understand. - It's scary. - Ok well, you know what... Let's just delete it then. You're an administrator too. You can do it. Just go on the app. Where is it? It's over, Cesar. You mean us? Yes. Fine. I'm going. I'll leave you alone. I'm sorry. Don't worry, no problem. It's really not a problem. - You ok? - Yeah, great. - Are you sure? - Yeah, absolutely. - Bye... - Bye. Sorry. Bye, Joel. See you. - You ok? - Yeah, no worries... - You sure? - Yeah... During autumn I can hear The sweet melody... - Mom? - Mm? Can I go to Zoe's tomorrow night? No, don't you have school? - Yes, so? - So, no! - Why? - It's a school night. I won't come home late! Who's picking you up? Me? - Yes! - No! It's 5 minutes away. I can see how this will end! You'll ask if you can sleep over. You'll go to bed late. I know Zoe's mom. She doesn't care. She lets her daughter sleep as late as she wants. It's out of the question! What's her mom got to do with this? Proof: Zoe's last in her class! So, sorry but you're not going. If we start comparing with others all my friends can go to sleep late. - And I can't! - Your friends do what they want. I don't care what others do! - We have rules here! - Fuck! - You must follow them. - Fucking rules! I said no! It's not complicated! You're fucking pissing me off! - I said no! Is that clear? - But why? I'm not going to discuss this for hours. - I said no! - Always a test or something... I've revised for my test! I've done everything! I haven't seen you working much lately. Your rules are fucked up! I can never do anything! - Can't do anything, you poor thing! - I can't do anything! Hey, your apple desert! Hello? - Mom? - Yes, honey. What's the matter? Hello? What's wrong? You're crying? No, it's ok. I can sense you're crying. Can you come to pick me up, please? Where are you? - Villeneuve. - I'm on my way. What's going on, honey? That bitch can go fuck herself. So, she's not pregnant? Right, Cesar? Did you ask her? - It's not her test? - No, mom, it's not hers. Don't worry, it'll work out for the best. Hello? Yes. How are you? I'm with Cesar. He's not well. - Who is it? - Wait, I'm on the phone. I don't get it. They were so cute... I just picked him up. He's not well. It's horrible, you know. It breaks my heart. He's devastated, he's crying. Can you check on your side? What? Who is it, Mom? - Thanks, Myriam! - Oh fuck! - See with Juliette. - Mom, hang up right now! - I said hang up now! - What's wrong? - Give me the phone! - What are you doing? Give me the phone, Mom! - Mom, hang up! - But Cesar! - Fucking hang up! - What are you doing to me? - Hang up! - I almost had an accident! You're fucking stupid, Mom! Why did you call Myriam? A broken heart doesn't give you the right to talk to me like that. - Grow up! - Shut up, Mom! Shut up for once! - Why did you call her? - Fine, ok! I won't interfere anymore. I just wanted to help. I'm sorry. Start the car. - You want me to call Myriam back? - No I don't! - She can talk to Juliette. - Don't fucking call her! It's your dad. Can I answer? Go ahead. Yes? No, I made mashed potatoes with carrots. No, please, your tortillas are disgusting. No, I'm with Cesar. No, he's not feeling well. I know, but it's my fault. It's true I interfered when it was none of my business. - I think he's a bit angry with me. - Fuck, Mom! Forgive me. I hate you. So, I talked to him... He's not mad at you anymore. Maybe he's right. I'm always on their backs. Stop it, you're great. You've always been great. They know that. Don't worry. You're sweet. And you? When are you leaving? When am I leaving? You've been wanting to leave for weeks but don't know how to tell me. Well, yes... You know when I started putting the pieces together I thought... Maybe it's just me... I'm not so young and fresh anymore. I'm almost 50 and completely asexual. It's normal that he's out there, looking for something new. So I thought... I can live with it. After all, you see each other in secret, is that so bad? I want us to stay together. In spite of me, of us. In spite of our boring couple. Because we're a happy family. We're a nice family, right? Yes, we're a nice family. But... You love each other more... And nobody can do anything about it. Not you... Not me... Not him. Him? Christian. Christian, no. What no? It's not Christian. It's Isabelle. - Who is Isabelle? - She's Christian. Christian is Isabelle? It's the name I put in case you'd read my texts. Obviously, you did. Christian is a woman? That's it. Fuck. Yeah, fuck. So, you're not... No. Did you bring her here? No. Yes or no? When I went to see my parents with the kids? No, it's not her. Impossible! - I want to see her! - No. I want to see her! No, Annie. - I want to see her! - No, Annie. She poured out on us all her frustration for not having had a career... She felt she had sacrificed everything for us. We didn't ask for that. - No, I want to see her! Where is she? - You can't go in like that! - I'm sorry. - Sorry, Isabelle, - I couldn't hold her back. - It's ok. It was bound to happen. Excuse me, Geraldine, we need to end the session here. I'll see you on Thursday, if you don't mind. Next Thursday. Sorry. She thinks you're pregnant. Annie, I'm 56 years old so... So, it's impossible. There. Should I apologize to you? Maybe that's what you came here for? Well I... I don't know actually... - He's been lying for months. - Well... To tell you the truth, I wrote you an email. - I'll read it to you. - No. We'd said it wasn't really a good idea. But it's just an explanation email. Annie needs an explanation. Obviously. Right? So, please, have a seat. No... I'll read it to you. Have a seat here. - Really... - Please, Laurent. Have a seat here. It's on my phone. I'm not really good with phones. Yes, I'll put my glasses on. I had several versions. But I think the last one is the best. I managed to find the right words in this one. "Annie, "since we met with Laurent, "at that congress in Annecy"... I don't know if he told you, but we met in Annecy. No. So, "I'm looking for the words "that'll touch your heart. "Far from wanting to hurt you"... I think I'd rather read it myself. - That would be better. - Really? - Yes. - So I... - Yes. - Fine... I... - Yes, later. - I'll send it to you. What's your email address? - Annie... - So... annie... .castillon... Dot castillon. Yes? @... I never know where the @ sign is. Oh right, yeah. @... gmail dot... dot com? Not dot fr, right? - Dot com. - No. Dot com. Otherwise, you'll never receive it. - So, dot com. - Dot com. Okay. I got it. When you read it, call me. - Doctor! - Yes? Excuse me, I'm sorry. Mr. Leblanc forgot to take his medicine. I'll finish up with Annie, then send him in. I'm going to go! Really? I'd rather you don't come home tonight. I'll walk you out. Are you hungry? - Do you want pasta? - Cesar? Cesar! Come and help. Coming... There you go... When are you coming? I said I'm coming. - Cesar... - Don't start, Max, please. - Cesar! - Damn it, Max! Open wide. You're ridiculous! Stop it! Where are you? Annie? Hope you're ok. I talked to my friend, Franck. The test belongs to his daughter. You know, the babysitter we had last week. Apparently, she wasn't only into tampons. So, I don't know, let's talk. I hope you're ok. Kisses. Lower the fucking music! I can see you, no use in hiding. Mrs. Castillon? Yes... Are you okay? You want a beer or something? Your parents are never home, are they? Since they've retired, they travel a lot. It's as if they had won the lottery. Do you have to listen to it this loud? - What? - The music. Do you have to listen to it this loud? Yeah, because it's Krautrock. That's how you listen to it. It's Can! You're gonna explain Can to me? You know Can? I went to their concert at the Berlin Festival. - You? - Yeah. I hitchhiked with friends to see them play. - Really? - Yeah! It was great. - What? - We managed to sneak in. We even went backstage! Then we followed them to the bar. Then to their hotel room, a huge suite. You what? And then? I snogged him! I even followed him into the bathroom. We flirted and... Anyways, it was lots of fun. What? He was cute back in the day. Pass me your thing... Fuck, Mrs. Castillon. Call me Annie, because Mrs. Castillon is... - Incredible! - Yeah... - You roll a mean joint! - Thanks. It's actually funny because when you become a mother, you don't know what to do, there's no explanation pamphlet, so... You act like an adult. You pretend to be one. And you pretend so much that you become an adult. Then you buy Geox shoes... What? Ouch. You ok? You're as fit as a fiddle. Are you looking for this? Yes. Thank you. You want some? Perhaps coffee instead? No. Tea maybe? Oh well... Here. Peschard's son. Peschard's son! - I said that? - Yep. You loaded it. Fuck. Hey! Well, hey! Where were you? I was here. We called you all night! I was next door. You were here or next door? I was at the Peschard's house. What were you doing there? Have you been drinking? You look terrible. - No, not drinking. - You couldn't have warned us? Why have a phone if you don't call? She's been drinking. - Yeah. - Where's dad? - Has Antoine had breakfast? - Yes. We gave him breakfast, we weren't gonna let him starve. Good! And Poppy? She's hiding in her room. Good. Why is she hiding? - Well... - You didn't get the text message? No? Poppy, Honey? Open the door. It's Mom. No, Mom. I don't want to go! Don't be ridiculous. You'll see, you'll be amazing! You've been training for weeks. It's gonna be great! No, Mom, I'm not ready! I don't want to go! If the coach called you, that means you're ready. No, I won't go! Go away! You know what? Do what you want... But open the door. It's dangerous to have closed doors like this. Anything can happen. Open the door! Nonsense. Please, Poppy, open the door. Don't be ridiculous. Tell her I made lemon cake. Max made lemon cake. Really? Yeah. Did he add whipped cream? Yes, loads. Yes, loads. With chocolate chips. With chocolate chips! Milk chocolate chips? Of course. Of course! C'mon, open the door. Open the door, honey. Ok. That's good. You promise you won't make me go! Promise. You're a big girl. You can do what you want now. - The cake's downstairs. - Grab her! No! - Put her in the car. - No! Let me go! I don't want to go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! I don't want to go! - I don't want to go! - It's going to be great. No! I don't want to go! Let me go! I don't want to go! Just shut the fuck up! Fuck! - Max. - Yeah, I'm coming. You ok, Poppy? Here we go! - You ok, Mom? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Yes. Ok, I'm completely stoned. Cesar, you drive, ok? What? I swear it's for the best. - No. - Yes. - Are you sure this is the right time? - Yes, it's actually the perfect time. Fuck, no, Mom. I don't know if I can. I promise, it's best you drive. Seatbelts buckled? Yes, c'mon, who cares! Go ahead, start the car. - Seatbelt! - C'mon, just drive! - Cesar, drive! - Yes, Mom. C'mon, the brakes. Now, accelerate at the same time! C'mon! Drive! Careful with the rear-view mirrors. You barely have the room... They have right-of-way. They have right-of-way! Fuck! Yes! Sorry! - Sorry! - Right-of-way means? Cesar concentrate! We almost had an accident. Yes, Mom, I know. Sorry. We'll never make it. There's no point. - C'mon, start the engine. - Yes. - On D. - Yes, I... No, put it back on P. - Push on D. - Yes. - C'mon. - On D or on P? Choose! - Cesar concentrate please. - Stop stressing me, please. - You're not on D. - Yes I am. - No, it's not working. - I'm... Oh fuck! No! You're going backwards. - Cesar you're going backwards! - Yes I know. Hit the brakes! Cesar the brakes! Yes! - Can't you concentrate? - Mom! - Put D and start the engine! - Mom! Fuck! It's your fault. I only drive on parking lots. We're going to be late! Get a move on! Mom! - Mom! - What? Shut up and get in the back! - I'm talking. - You're useless. Get out! I can't say anything... You're so touchy. C'mon! People are waiting. C'mon! - You've never learnt how to drive? - Can you hurry, please, Mom! Take your time! Mom, it's too late, let's not go. All year, you did our heads in with your gymnastics! - Are you listening? - Yes. Cesar, push D. Ok? 1... 2... 3! Well it's about time! There you go. We almost had an accident. Mom? Shut up! Yeah, shut up, Mom! It's not a right-of-way sign, it's a stop sign. - I'm telling you now. - Mom, shh... Careful, it's not a right-of-way sign, it's a stop sign. Ok, can you speed up? Trust yourself. I'm not ready. Yes you are. You're going to be great. I'll do your makeup. - Is this your bag? - Yeah. It's the blue eye shadow. No need to congratulate me on how well I drive! Honestly, you're remarkable. Always more than needed. Look up. Careful, boys, I'm doing Poppy's eyes. Take it easy, no bumps. - Ok. - Let's see. Show me. Poppy's so beautiful! She's going to be amazing. No, she's ugly. Hey! No, she's not ugly. That's not nice. - The road. - Yes, I know. Slowly. - I'm fine, calm down. - Right line. I feel fucking comfortable! C'mon! Hurry! - It's not too late? - No, it's ok. - Your bag! - Thanks! Mom! Yes! - Hello. - Hi, Dora! I know what happened. If you ever need anything, if you need to talk, - I'm here. - What for? Your father told us. Oh fuck, the tampon story? He's been telling everyone. - It happened once, no big deal. - Oh no, not that. The pregnancy test I found. What are you on about? You old people have too much free time. You need new hobbies. You need to let us live a bit. I'm gonna warm up. I can see you! That was the Montpellier RG team, ladies and gentlemen, let's give them a round of applause. - Are you stressing out? - Fuck yes. Don't worry, it'll be fine. And now The Glitters! It's our turn. Let's go and have fun. Let's clap for them! Look, she's over there. She didn't wear my leotard? Your leotard was ugly. It's amazing how much she's grown. Yes? It's her! Who? The pregnancy test. It's Poppy! Yes, it's Poppy. Did you know? Yes. But why? Why didn't she tell me? Why didn't she tell me? She was afraid to tell you. She was afraid you'd panic. So... She handled it alone, with me. It went well. She's a strong girl. You can be proud. Let's hear it for The Glitters! Great job! You were great. Your spin, Noisette, was great. So, the group work, you've never done it so well, it was brilliant! Just the pench√©, - I think you can improve your pench√©, - Poppy? like we did this morning, it was much better, so well done. Did you see the girls before us? I'm sorry about the leotard. No big deal. Are you ok? What's wrong? I'm sorry. I should've been there with you. I should've listened to you. No, I'm the one who's sorry. I'm sorry. I should've told you. I was afraid you'd hate me. I was afraid you'd get mad. That you wouldn't want to talk or see me anymore. I'm so sorry. I don't want to be a monster. But you're not a monster. I love you more than anything in this world. You have to tell me when I'm being an old fool. You're embarrassing me in front of everyone, but you're not an old fool. You're beautiful. Thank you. Your leotard is nice. Go ahead, they're waiting. I didn't say 2nd place. I said 1st place. Yeah. Don't take it too easy. It can always be better. C'mon, our little prayer. Hey. Get up. Stop making me smoke at night. Can I have coffee with you? No. C'mon, get up. See you tonight, Mrs. Castillon. See you tonight. - Good morning, Kevin. - Hello. Can you pass the bottle of milk, please? Thank you. You're going to show me how to make your bottle. Careful. We're going to... - Hello. - Hey. What do you want? - Hot chocolate. - Three, two. Hi everyone! FOUR MONTHS LATER Are you sure you don't need my help? No, don't worry. It makes me happy. Everything's fine. I swear, we're gonna be late. We're going to win! Antoine, behave with your sister. - Mom? - Yes. Can I drive? Yeah, if you want. Max, hurry up! Yeah... Did you check-in your instruments? - No worries... - Follow the classes. - Don't worry, Dad. - And enjoy. Don't worry. My great artist. Isa and I will come for Christmas. Don't make that face. I'm going to miss you. Me too. It's a bit scary though. Nope, it'll be fine. You're not alone. I'll call you, when I get there. I should've put condoms in his bag. He'll bang everyone on the plane. Do you wanna have lunch with us? Who do I drop off first? - Poppy? - Aren't you seeing Antoine's therapist? Oh yes, right. We're going to cancel, ok, Antoine? - Let's cancel the therapist? - I don't want to go. Very good. He's an asshole! No, don't talk like that, Antoine. - That's enough. - He's an asshole. - Stop saying that. - I don't want to go. - He's an asshole. - Antoine, stop it! That's enough. Poppy! Wake up. Come see! - I have something to show you. - No... You're a pain. Let me go! Look! What's going on? There, you see! Fuck, that's Mom! She smokes? Who cares if she smokes! C'mon, this sucks. Poppy!
