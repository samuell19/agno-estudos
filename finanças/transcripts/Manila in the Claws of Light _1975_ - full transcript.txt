MANILA - IN THE CLAWS OF LIGHT Your name? Julio Madiaga. I came to you last week. You told me to come back today. Ever been a labourer before? I have. Where? In Cubao, sir. But the building is nearly finished. They don't need labourers anymore. Ok, you got the job. But I don't like lazy people. I'll pay you 2.50 pesos a day. But my former employer paid me 3 pesos. Then go work there! Sorry, sir, I just thought... Omeng! Have him replace Gorio. Put Gorio back in cement mixing. Thank you, Mr. Balajadia. Thank you. What's wrong? It's probably from hunger. I haven't eaten since yesterday. What happened to him? He probably fainted out of hunger. Never go to work on an empty stomach. What's going on? Hasn't eaten since yesterday, He passed out. Wait here. Where's his food? - What? - His food? Idiot! He has no food! Exactly. Ok, back to work. Your work is waiting for you. Come on! Come on. Let's all go back to work. Here. Go eat something. - Just leave some for me for lunch. - Thanks. Watch out for the foreman. He'll surely give you hell. Thanks, man. Thanks. Haven't smoked these in a while. How did you end up here? I don't know. Tough life back home. I was just a fisherman. Tougher out here. With money, living here is bliss. Otherwise, it's hell. - Got any relatives here? - I don't know. I probably have some but I don't know them. - Have you been here long? - About seven months. How did you manage? I had some money with me. Sometimes, I'd find some menial work here and there. Where do you sleep? Anywhere. Tough situation. Be thankful you're still fit for work. I had a body like that when I first came here. But look at me now, thin as a grill rack. Why don't you find another job? Like what? Hey! We're trying to sleep here! Damn it! - I'm just practicing. - Practice later! Take Benny, all he wants to be is a singer. But somehow he ended up here. He's lucky, he doesn't have a family to take care of. Unlike me, with a wife and 6 kids. That's 8 mouths to feed. - How much does Balajadia pay you? - 7 pesos. That's 42 if I work all week. What is Fatso paying you? 2.50 pesos. Crafty son-of-a-bitch! That's how much he paid me when I first started. In 5 months, all I got was a peso raise, - Plus "taiwan." - "Taiwan"? What's that? That means "selling" your wages. This is how it goes: on your payday, say this is your pay. The contractor says: "There's no money... But there's "taiwan". We'll give you an advance. But... ...we'll take a 10% deduction." So what can you do? A poor guy like you, living from hand to mouth? What else but "borrow" your wages? Even if it means getting less. What really hurts is "buying" your wages with money... ...that is actually owed to you. Like being fried in your own fat. Try complaining and you're out of a job. Not easy to find work these days. I'll be leaving tomorrow. I'm going with Mrs. Cruz. Is that your decision? I'll try my luck in Manila. That is what Mother wants. You can come to Manila, too. That's okay. I'm better off here. I will wait for you. Abobo, Francisco. Bondallan, Maximo. Madiaga, Julio. Why does it say 4 pesos on this paper? Don't be a smartass! If I say sign, Yo" Sign! That's my business! - But... - Son-of-a-bitch! But why write 4 pesos? That's the scam. The pay's bigger on paper. That's called magic! Don't dare complain again, or you're out of a job. You can sleep here. A lot of workers sleep here, so you won't be alone. What's this for? For cigarettes. Thanks, man. Frank. Gido. Imo! What's up? Take care of him. They'll take care of you. They cook their meals here. You don't sleep here? No, they go home to their families. See you. Stop singing and eat. Where's Imo? In the back, washing himself. Imo! Chow time! Okay! Imo's ambitious. He goes to night school. You should do it, too. Or you're stuck here forever. Times have changed. Everyone needs a diploma nowadays. The only way to get respect is to finish school. One thing I don't like about you, man... What? You can't sing! Smartass! What about you? Any plans to study? I'm too old. So what? Older people than you are still studying. Like Maximo and his balding head! Idiot! Stop picking on my head! How old are you anyway? 21. You're only 21? Imo's 33, losing his hair, but he's still studying. Moron. Who's 33? You mean 23! 23? Did you hear that? Good God! Your move! Get an education. Take my example. Even with 4 subjects at a time, I'm nearly finished. It just takes persistence and, of course, some brain power. When did you stop studying? I only finished elementary school. Elementary? Well, that's a little difficult. So listen, Benny: go back to school before you shrivel up. There is no future in this hell-hole. See you later, guys! 'Bye. Study well, my son. Protect your head from the cold night air! Assholes! In a way, I'm impressed with Imo. He's got ambition, that fool. As for me, I'm content with this. Got no problems. How about you? What? Nothing. What do you mean nothing? What do you want to know? Why are you here? I don't know. You ran away from home? Yes. Same with me, I ran away, too. Around two years ago. I'm from the South. But now I'm a Manila boy. With a heavy Southern accent! Wooh! That's hot! Someday, it won't just be steak or liver for me. In the province, I get better food than this. Then go home, stupid. Sometimes, I think about it but... There's nothing for you in the province. What are you going to do there? I'll plow land. Then I think twice, and I decide to stay put. It's still better here. Right. With all the hardships come all the pleasures. With 3 bucks, you can buy all the happiness you want. In the province, probably not. True! Even with little money, there are many places to see. And lots of women! Not only that. Living here may be hard, but as long as you're here, there's always the chance of hitting the jackpot. That's right. Like me, if I make it as a singer here, I'll make it big time! That is if you get lucky. I'm sure of it! In the province, if you're born with the plow, you die with the plow. So it's settled, I'm taking her to Manila. She's taking you to Manila. But... The work's easy. And you'll be with girls like yourself. You get free food while earning 30 pesos a month. Just think about it, God knows you'll never earn that kind of money here. I'll even send you to school. See? Think about that. You can even send money for your siblings' education. Madiaga! Get off your ass! Where's Imo? Why are you late? I was just looking for the chief electrician. Why? Do you work for him now? I just returned the newspaper I borrowed. Do I pay you to read? Go on! Start working! Lazy bums! You're being paid to work! Go ahead, sing. Hey! It's too early for that. Now you can sing! As loud as you want! Any request, Imo? Crazy guy! I was just kidding! What's your request? Sing "Thirst"! "Thirst"? OK. My broken heart grieves Give it to me! Forever... Watch out! Let's go! Quick! That's what happens when you fool around. Let's move him slowly. Be careful of his head. Is he dead? Call a cab, quick! To the Makati Hospital? No! Take him where it's free! Fuck! Anywhere! Hurry! Hurry UP! Be careful with his head. Make way! Take him to the hospital. You over there! What are you still looking at? Slacking off? Go on! Get back to work! Why are you still standing around? Get back to work! Useless bums! What about you? Get back to work. That goes for all of you. What about you? What are you sitting around for? Sorry, sir. - Get back to work. - Yes, sir. Take off your shoes for now. You're lucky you only got hit on the foot. Yeah. Poor Benny. He was too carefree. Don't! It hurts! It's swelling. Maybe you should go home. It might get worse. It's okay, I'll bear the pain. Can't lose half a day's pay. That's still 1.75 pesos. He's dead. What happens to Benny? Who cares? He's dead. He's finished. Has he got relatives here? None. If no one claims his body from the morgue, it'll probably be sold to schools, to be dissected by medical students. Lay off the wheelbarrow. Stick to shoveling. Your foot could get worse. Thanks. This is where we live, it's a slum. Whom do you live with? My father and my sister. And your mother? She's dead. What's it like here? You get used to it. We get by somehow. The canal's really black. All of them are. Atong, what's wrong with your foot? A piece of lumber fell on it. - Be more careful. - I will. - Early to work? - Hard to find a cab. - Pretty today! - None of your business! I just itch looking at the water. - What happened to you, Atong? - Accident at work. Be careful! Eat well! Don't be shy. We may be poor, but we manage to eat. What about Perla? She'll eat after Father's been fed. Look at those kids, not a care in the world. That won't last. Wait till they grow up. Julio, you're taking too long! I'm pushing as hard as I can! You fell! C'mon Julio. Stop that! My father is paralyzed. He was shot in the spine. Why did he get shot? Our land was taken away from us. We used to farm 5 hectares of land in Quezon City. Till Giazon, a Spanish millionaire, took it. We lost the dispute. We were ordered to leave, but we refused. Father was stubborn, he said they'd have to kill us first. When the bulldozer came, he charged with his bolo knife. But one of Giazon's men shot him. How did they get the land if it was rightfully yours? We didn't have any papers to prove ownership. But Giazon did. Father insisted the land had always belonged to our family. Even our ancestors were born there. But that didn't matter. We still lost the case. Duck eggs! Want a Chinese girl? She's a student and very young. It's your lucky day. How about it, Mister? She'll give you a manicure, a pedicure, the works. C'mon, Mister. She's really good. Here comes the paymaster! The paymaster's here! Fall in line. How can I say this? Contractor's got no funds again. Really? Then it's "taiwan" again! Quiet! That's better than nothing. "Taiwan" it is. Okay. 6 Pesos? Yes, my last price. I'll take it for 1.50. I say 6 and you say 1.50? That's not dried fish! - Buy elsewhere... - I'm just trying to bargain! - You call that bargaining? - Okay, fine! I don't want your money, you can shove it... You're wasting my time. I don't want to buy this anyway! - Bitch! - Just like you! - Ugly hag! - You're uglier! - Come here! - And what? - Wanna fight? - Get out of here! Go shop in a flea market! Ma'am... - Bitch! - You're the bitch! - Stuck-up bitch! - Pest! Ma'am... I'm sorry, sir. How much for this? This one? 9 pesos. My best price. I'll give you 6 for it. The fabric's kinda thin. That's too low. 8 and you can have it. Still too much. 6 is fine. But this is good fabric. Can't afford it. Let's go. It's a bargain. I'll make no profit if I sell it for 6 pesos. Sir! Come back! 7, okay? How about 6.50? I'll lose money. 7.00 pesos is as cheap as it gets. Wait, Sir! How about 6.80? I'm sure we can agree on that price. Okay, wrap it up. You're lucky we're closing soon. This is a losing sale. Julio? Julio? Mrs. Cruz! Help! Police! What's wrong? Julio! Thanks. Why did you run after her? She looked like the woman who took Ligaya. Ligaya? Who is she? Just between you and me, Ligaya is my girl from back home. What about the woman you were chasing? She looked like the woman who brought Ligaya here. I didn't know her but... They called her Mrs. Cruz. Fat, like the woman I chased. Mrs. Cruz came to our town looking for young women. She said they'd be factory workers in Manila, and they could study, too. She recruited three women from our town. One of them was my girlfriend. Where is she now? I don't know. I mean, I'm not sure. Does your family know you're here in Manila? No, I left without telling anyone. Your mother must be worried about you. My parents died a long time ago, leaving four orphaned children. We got split among aunts and uncles. We grew up separately. I ended up with an ill-tempered uncle, who loved coconut liquor. He became abusive whenever he drank. What now? What do you mean? What are you going to do? I don't know. What happened, man? I lost all my money. H OW? Someone brought a woman here. At first, only Enteng was interested. I wasn't really interested. But when the show started, I got all horny, I lost control. How can you ignore something happening in front of you? Like the devil himself jumped on my nape. Where are they doing it? Over there. Gido just finished, he was 6th in line. Isn't that prohibited in here? Prohibited? Try stopping them now! How did they get inside? The guards must have let them in. Fucking hell. Why did they let those devils in? Hey buddy... You got money to spare? I need some for my exam expenses tomorrow. Here's 3 pesos. What about you? Don't worry about it. Thanks. I owe you. I shouldn't take your money but I really need it. - Till next payday. - Okay. How was it? Was it good? Great. Gotta shower now! How about you? You want some? Cheap, like I charged your friends. Look, he's the last one. Psst...Come over here! Just look at her body. That body! Just take a look at her. You don't want her? I'll pass. You might regret it. No. Okay, it's up to you. It's your loss. Listen, everybody! The building is nearly finished. As you all know, I have to let some of you go. Some of you are no longer needed. If I call out your name, that means tough luck. You broke it! Just leave and I'll take care of it. So careless. Cost me money. Ligaya! Hey. What happened to your girl? What girl? A certain... Ligaya? Who told you about her? Atong did. Ligaya is my girlfriend. For a long time now. But her mother didn't approve of me. I was only a fisherman. Her mother had high hopes for her. One day, this Mrs. Cruz arrived in our town. Fat woman, looked like a pig. She was looking for girls who wanted to work in Manila. She guaranteed them jobs and a chance to study. She told stories about the good life in Manila. Especially for the pretty ones. She convinced Ligaya's mother to send her to Manila. Ligaya was reluctant, but she was also curious about Manila. She even asked me to go with her the last time we talked. She wrote me just once. I wrote her a few letters, but she never replied. One day, a letter arrived at Ligaya's home. Her mother was in tears. It said that Ligaya was missing. Mrs. Cruz wrote that Ligaya ran away without notice. And that she was missing a pair of diamond earrings. She said that Ligaya showed her no gratitude. That filthy pig. Where's your girl now? That's why I came to Manila. I had a lot of money at first. 137 pesos to be exact. I searched all over Manila. But... I couldn't find Ligaya. I must have scoured every corner of the city. One day, in Pandacan... I got mugged by a group of men. Luckily, they didn't take my diary. It's where I keep Ligaya's only letter. What did you do then? What else could I do? I couldn't search for her on an empty stomach. Thankfully, I found a job at a construction site in Cubao. A new building like this one was going up. There I became friends with Pol. He was a co-worker. He's also a student, like you. I told him about Ligaya. He told me that "Mrs. Cruz" was probably just an alias that she uses when she's on the prowl for girls. Pol said Ligaya was probably pretty. I told him yes. Ligaya is beautiful. She's the most beautiful woman for me. The most beautiful girl in our town. I took Pol's advice and went to Doroteo Jose street. I got lucky. Within that first day of watching, I spotted Mrs. Cruz. She looked like a pig. She probably has the soul of a pig. I followed her everywhere. But... Nothing happened. Then one day, I followed her again... ...until the Sta. Cruz district, to a house on Misericordia. Then she entered a house with a sign that said "Chua Tek." I waited. Probably for half an hour. When Mrs. Cruz left, I approached the door. What is it? Does Ligaya live here? Who is Ligaya? Ligaya Paraiso. I don't know the name of the master's wife. I'm new here. But... Who is it? He's looking for someone named Ligaya Paraiso. There is no one here by that name! What are you planning in case you're right? I'm thinking perhaps... Can I ask... ...the police? The police? Are you crazy? You can't just do that. Especially if she's already married to that Chinese. It's tough to get her back. Maybe if you had money. But the guy's Chinese, they always have lots of money. By the way, can you pitch in for me tomorrow? I've got an important appointment. You should tell Mr. Balajadia first. No, I won't. He'd only get mad. He'd never let me go. But I gotta skip work for that appointment. What'll I tell Mr. Balajadia? Tell him I have to be at a relative's funeral. Really? Who died? No one! I just made it up. I'm applying for a new job tomorrow. Where? At an advertising company, man. Hey, man... Wake up. Hey. You can't sleep here anymore. Why not? According to the contractor, laid off workers can't sleep here anymore. It's the contractor's order. That's why I'm here. Where are you gonna sleep tonight? I don't know. It doesn't matter. Wish I could take you in but there's no room. I got six kids. You can sleep at my place. I was thinking of that. What about tomorrow? What are you gonna do? I don't know. That's unfortunate. It's almost Christmas. I'm saving up for Christmas. I can finally buy Perla new shoes and a new dress. She hasn't worn anything new in a while. She should look "fresh" this Christmas. Right? Yeah. How much are you paid for overtime work? Same as the regular rate. It's like half a day's pay. It's only another 4 hours. Shouldn't overtime pay be higher? It should, but our contractor doesn't do it. If you tell Fatso that, he'll say he doesn't force anyone to work overtime. Doesn't matter. Overtime's a big help. Hey, man, that lucky guy's gonna have a merry Christmas! What guy? Imo. What a lucky bastard! Some people have all the luck! How much are they paying you? 250 pesos, man! Imagine! 250 pesos! Will we ever see such money? Some people just have all the luck. Just coming home? Had a busy night? None of your business! - May I have some of that? - Watch it! You dirty old man! Bastard! Your child's hungry! Where are you going? Don't know. I'll manage. Don't worry about me. Thanks for the breakfast, Perla. - Come back soon. - Sure. Take care. But why work in Manila? It's Mother's wish, Julio. And Mrs. Cruz says I can study in Manila. Don't you want that? She will also give me work. That means I can help Mother. Please say yes, Julio. I won't be there forever. Please... Some harm may befall you. Don't worry, Edes and Saling are coming, too. I've been looking for this kid. Sorry to bother you, sir. Thief! He snatched my bag! Stop him, please! Thief! Somebody call the cops! He's getting away! Help! Call the cops! Please! I won't do it again! Mister! Mister! Thanks! Let me win! Let me win! Presenting, Miss International: Aurora Pijuan! You're so lovely! A man... Fall in line! Quick! Hey, stud! What a snob! Looks like our plans won't go through. Here he is. Looks like he just got out of bed. What do you want? Nothing. Hey, man, got a light? You hang around here? Why are you here? No reason. I thought you didn't have a light. I was kidding. One can't be too careful here. Cigarette? It's not safe here. Especially if you're alone. A lot of thieves. I've got nothing worth stealing. How about you? Why are you alone? I know a lot of people here. I have lots of friends. What's your name anyway? I'm Bobby Reyes. I'm Julio. Madiaga. Any plans tonight? None. Wanna have some fun? No, thanks. I'm broke. I'll take care of that. Thanks but I just wanna rest here. This place is dangerous. You might end up in jail if you stay here. Come to my apartment, if you like. It's in Ermita. What work did you do in construction? I was just a labourer. How much did you earn? 2.50 a day, 4 on paper. The foreman's scam. 2.50 a day? How'd you survive? You can stay here while you have no other place. Won't I be a bother? Your apartment's really nice. No bother at all. Where's your family? They're in the province. My work's here in Manila but I visit them once a week. What's your work? I work in a night club. Can you get me a job there? That would depend on you. You'd need nice clothes. Wait a minute. Try this shirt on. Wear this instead of that one. This is a bit too much. No, it's okay. That's old but it still looks good. Here are pillows. You can sleep on the floor for now. Maybe I shouldn't. You're too kind. Hey, you're my guest. Okay? Thanks. Slowly... See you. Thanks, Bobby. I'll call you. Okay. A friend. Thanks. Let's eat. Why don't you wear the shirt I gave you? I'm not going anywhere special. Who was that man? Well, that's my job. Don't worry, I'm not gay, if that's what you're thinking. That's my job. I'm a call-boy. What's a call-boy? What do you call women who sell their bodies? Whores. What do you call men who do the same? Man-whores? How do you think I can afford all this? What should I do? Work in a construction site? For 2.50 a day? Not me. What's wrong with this? Our clients are people, too. How else can I afford to eat like this? Don't worry, man. I won't force you into this. But if money's your problem, this is the solution. You gotta have the stomach for where we're going. You worked in construction, so you're probably tougher than me. Where are we going? To Cesar's apartment. In one night, you can easily make 20 pesos. More if you're diligent. Just a moment. What's the matter? Nothing. I thought I saw someone I knew. C'mon. This is no time to play Peeping Tom. Come in. Don't be nervous. Welcome to Scheherazade, the House of Pleasure! Bobby! Who's that gorgeous beauty with you? Come in, don't be shy. Welcome, Bobby! This is our newest recruit. His name is Julio. Julio, meet Pitay. This is Veronica. Meet our friends. This is Jerry. That's Bert. And that's Perry... Edgar . Peter. Ricky. That's Lito, Pete. And many others, like Boy. There's Ricky, then Romy. Hold on for a second. Romy. And there's Jong. Oh God, there are so many of you. Call me later, around 9? Ok? Julio. Meet Cesar. He owns the place. This is Julio. How are you doing, Julio? Is he ready? Coming? Come this way, the Jasmine room is ready. Veronica, any vacant room? In a moment. I've been waiting long. Do you want to work here? Do you know what to do? There's only one reason why people work here. Money. If that's what you want, you can find that here. Easily. But a little cooperation is needed. No one here's forcing you. We can always negotiate. This one's finished. - Next! - Thank God! Well? What? The first time is the hardest. Did Cesar say you can refuse certain tricks? It's true. Pitay tells the client about each guy's specialty. You'll be okay. Ricky! Welcome back! Come in, you fabulous thing! Sabrina! Welcome! Pitay, call the boys. We have many new discoveries! Come in, all of you. Choose anyone you want. There you are, Ricky! They're so lovely. It's been a long time, Ricky. We've missed you so. Make your choice. We have a lot of new recruits. New superstars from all over the country. That's Edgar. He can do wonders with that mustache. He's really good. And Perry with a great body! Then there's Boy, whose long legs will drive you crazy. Latin-type Bobby, seasoned stud. Julio. Well, he's new... There's Peter, There's uh... Romy, Johnson... And there are the new arrivals, like Mario... So many! You'll have fun tonight! They've been gathered here tonight so... I wish you to enjoy, my dear. - Your puppy's having a fit! - I like him. That's Julio, our newest discovery. - Julio, our Mexican beauty... - I want him. We need to instruct him well, knowing how finicky you are! Which room would you like? The Blue Room? Veronica, give Julio instructions. We don't want to disappoint Ricky. It's been a long time since he was here. I'll get the Blue Room ready. Make it good, Julio. It's like hitting the jackpot! You're his type! Are you finished, my dear? Give us a moment while we fix your room. - What's your name? - Julio. How old are you? 21. What's wrong? I'm quite new to this. I forgot you're new! Come here, I'll work on you. C'mon, don't be shy now. Come on. Please. You're being coy. Just relax. Bullet, not there. I told you not to bother us. You're very naughty! Wait till Mama's finished. Stay there and be a good dog. Bullet, what's with you? You're being a pest. Bullet, I told you not to lick Julio's feet. You're so annoying. Can't you see I'm busy? Don't do that again. Just stay there. C'mon, Bullet, it's all over. Mama's finished. Now you can be annoying. Before I forget... This is for you. If you want to earn big bucks, learn all the tricks! Otherwise, you'll be a flop. Let's go, Bullet! Anybody home? - Good morning. - Good morning to you, too. - What do you want? - Is Pol home? - May I know who's asking? - Julio, a friend. POI! Pol! A friend to see you. Okay. Julio! Nice to see you! Come in! Have some eggs. Thanks. When were you laid off? I haven't seen you in a while. It was a bit sudden. Maybe there's a spot for me where you work. Okay. Come with me. - Hey, man, you want some...? - No, thanks. What about you? She's very young. Look. We don't have any money. Then borrow some, right? Look. We said no! Don't be a jerk. Have you tried asking if Ligaya lives there? Just the one time I told you about. Want to try again? Okay, but... they may recognize me. Can you do it for me? Okay. I'll be right back. Well? No Ligaya in that house. That Chinese has probably told the maid what to say. Let's go. Risky to push it. We're wasting our time. - Good morning. - Hey, man, come in! Have a seat. I'll leave you guys alone. Have some coffee. This is nice. Any good news? Yes, we've got work again. You available next week, Julio? Yes, of course. Great. Another big job? Yup, a wall around a big property. Where? At Loyola Heights, in Quezon City. Where's that? Near the Jesuit university. An upscale place. Many rich people live there. It's a big property. I'll need a couple more workers. You know anyone? - Yes! Atong! - Who? I worked with him at La Madrid. Nice guy. Hardworking, too. I can vouch for him. Is he the guy you told me about? Yes, he always helped when I was in a fix. Doesn't he have a job? Probably. But not much longer. The building is almost finished. Hey Julio! What's up? Omeng, it's Julio. - Hey, merry Christmas! - You've put on weight. How have you been? Long time no see. You look smart. How are you? This is my friend Pol. Eddie, this is Pol. What brings you here? I'm looking for Atong. Didn't you hear? Atong is dead. What? Happened last week. We just buried him. What happened? Balajadia was probably involved. He and Atong had a big fight. He withheld Atong's pay because of a broken soap dish. Atong became livid. He said the soap dish came in broken. Atong attacked Balajadia. Next we hear Atong's in jail. Then he's dead. He got beaten up bad while inside. Turns out Fatso's got a cousin who works there. Stop reading and work! They live here now but they once owned land in Quezon City. - But they were forced out. - Why? I'm not sure. Atong just mentioned it briefly. I thought our place was bad but look at this. Right, we're lucky in a way. I slept here once, there's plenty of mosquitoes and it reeked of... - The sewer? - Yeah. But Atong was a good friend. He always said I could count on him anytime. - It's you. Come in. - Perla. Please, sit down. Good morning, sir. Perla, I'd like you to meet Pol. Sit down. He helped me get a job. It wasn't me, really, but my friend. By the way, have you eaten? We have. Don't worry about us. I just learned about it, Perla. Had I found out sooner, we'd have been at his funeral. Are you sure you've already eaten? I can cook something quickly. We've eaten. What about your case? Aren't you filing charges? No one can do that... except me, but I don't know where to start. A person talked to me, a detective. He told me he'd take care of it, and I should just wait for his report. But I know nothing's being done. That's a problem. Why would they act when they're behind the crime? People here keep telling me... that I should just keep quiet. Because if I don't, some harm may befall me. It's because I'm practically alone. A young man who lived here was beaten up by the police. When his parents complained, thugs came and threatened them. What's your plan? None. I don't know. We're leaving now, Perla. It's still early. We'll be back. Goodbye, sir. Take this, Perla. A little help. Thank you. This is from me, Perla. It's nothing, really. Take it. Thank you. You know what? Perla's my type. And she's used to hardship. A lot of men go for rich women, but me, I like the poor ones better. You agree? Sure. A girl used to dried fish... will be happy with smoked fish. But take a girl used to ham, and feed her fish... and it's a big showdown. It's easy to please a poor girl. Right. Why don't you court her instead? She's like a sister to me. - You sure? - Yeah. - Seriously? - I'm serious. You won't be sorry if I courted her? No. Okay. Merry Christmas, sir! Take this. Thank you, sir. Here, I've finished writing it. Thanks. - How much will you give her? - 10 pesos. Is that enough? That's about right. Here, add this. She'll think it's all from me. That's okay. Let's add a note. The 10 is from you. That's not necessary. If you say so. Hey, are you going anywhere tomorrow? No. Why? You should come with me. Let's give our present to Perla. Sure! Excuse me. Do you know where Perla is? Perla - The daughter of Pilo, the cripple? - Yes. She's gone. And she probably won't come back. I saw her last night. She was in an ambulance. Her father was burned. - Where did they go? - No idea. Are you a relative? No, we're just friends. She wasn't here when the fire started. She'd left to get some thread for her knitting jobs. When she returned, the fire was almost out. Mrs. Cruz! Where's Ligaya? Who? Let go of me! Ligaya Paraiso! The girl from Marinduque! - I don't know anyone by that name! - Where is she, Mrs. Cruz? Police! - A thief! Police! - Where's Ligaya? What's going on? He tried to steal my bag! You bastard! No, sir! I know Mrs. Cruz! Do your explaining at the station! You thieving piece of shit! Let's go! Do you have an ID? This is not an ID. That's all I got. This won't do. Let's go. Wanna fight me? Why won't you come willingly? I did nothing wrong. You were stealing someones bag. Go! - Bastard! - Give me back my diary. Later, at the station. I need it. You don't trust me? Wanna get beaten up? No, sir, but that letter is important to me. Wait here. Don't move. I'm going to the bathroom. Miss, did you see a guy in blue, with a mustache? Yes, he went that way. If I see his face again, I would kill him. I don't care about my money, but he also took Perla's! And Ligaya's letter... But I'll never forget that face. He shouldn't show himself to me. So you're broke? If you ever need money, just ask. Forget about what happened. Tough guy, huh? Go ahead, it's just the heat. He's smaller than you. What now? My friend's not scared but there's nothing to fight about. C'mon, shake hands. Let's get drunk one day, Toro, and settle this over liquor. - Okay? - Sure. 2 pesos, my best price. Too much. It's got a long shaft. - Your last price? - Okay, 1.50. - 1 peso. - 1.50. 1.50 is a bit much. Okay, you win. Hey, man! - Don't you remember me? - You startled me. You look guilty. Guilty people startle easily. It's been a while, man. Where are you headed? Nowhere. C'mon, let's grab a bite. Come on, it's my treat. - I can't. - Come on. How's Omeng and the others? I don't know. I haven't seen them in a while. I bet they're still in construction. You know what? You've got no future if you're stuck in construction. Did you hear about Atong? Yeah. I'm glad you mentioned it. Can you clean this up? I just heard about it recently. Guess who told me? Who? Ever met Atong's sister? Perla. So you've been to their place. Yeah, where is she? You met up with her? She told me about Atong's death and the fire that killed their father. Where is she now? At Etang's place, in Makati. Do you know about it? Why? Where is it? You don't know? It's where men go... You know, when they're in heat. I couldn't believe it when I saw her. I was surprised to see her there. You should visit her sometime. She's always there. 20 pesos and you're set. 12 for the girl and 8 for the beer. Reasonable! You can afford it. Did he take Perla? What do you mean? Did he take her into a room? Fuck him... if he did! She's his friend's sister. He didn't say that he did, but they talked. What did Perla say? Why is she there? Imo didn't say anything about that. Who's Imo? The guy who invited me to eat. Let's go see her. - Perla? - Yeah. Are you crazy? She'd be ashamed to see us. I'm to blame for what happened to Perla. Why? I'm unlucky with women. I like Perla. I should have courted her. This is the third time. Remember? Ligaya? How are you? Okay... Why are you here? I've been searching for you. You've changed. Where can we talk? You decide. How've you been? I'm fine. And you? I'm happy. Because I found you. What happened to you? I've been in Manila for a while now... About a year. I've been looking for you, because you stopped writing. We shouldn't talk here. Where should we go? Do you remember Mrs. Cruz? She must be the devil personified. She took me to a big house. I don't know where. It had a big yard... with high walls... and tall acacia trees. Guards manned the gate. Mrs. Cruz said it was a factory and the manager would see us. And the fool that I was, I just followed her everywhere. And then she spoke to a woman... who looked like a witch. And then... we were taken to... a room... that looked like an office. We were told to wait there for the manager. Then someone brought in a drink. Orange. I hadn't finished the drink, but I already felt dizzy. Then I woke up in bed. With a Chinese beside me. Ah Tek? How did you know? The house on Misericordia? I've been watching that house. I was hoping to find you there. I followed Mrs. Cruz from the flat on Doroteo Jose. The address you wrote me. And then, she walked all the way to Misericordia. I got the feeling you were there. Yes. Mrs. Cruz collects money there. Ah Tek pays for me. I lived 2 months in the house where she first took me. Ah Tek came to me twice a week. There were many girls there. I couldn't find the others because... I was locked up in a room. A room so small it was like... living inside a box of matches, where no one could hear even if you screamed. But sometimes... sometimes I'd hear... screaming, crying. And then one day, Ah Tek told me... I was lucky he took care of me. You know. Like I was somehow... indebted to him. The fool confessed... he liked me. The other women who lived there... served different men every night. 3 or 4 men. And I was the only one not injected with morphine. He said I should be grateful for that, too. He said... I had only him to thank... Because otherwise, I would be addicted to morphine. If I get injected with it, I would lose all my inhibitions. I'd be displayed before men and made to dance... dance naked. But he didn't want that to happen to me. Because he liked me. He'd already given me a lot of money. He had paid a lot for me. And he felt like giving me up. But, he liked me. He didn't want me to end up like the others. So if I agreed, he'd take me out of there, and I'd live with him. But I had to follow his every wish. Because if I didn't... I'd be sent right back. It was an ultimatum. I kept silent. So he called that woman, the one who looked like a witch. Then they took me to another room. Inside was a woman... being shot up with morphine. Then yet to another room. Inside was another woman... who was being denied the morphine. She was going insane. How does he treat you? He's good to me. He always consoles me and... He buys me things. A watch, a ring... A bracelet. But I can't leave the house. I'm like a prisoner. Whenever he steps out, someone else watches me. How did you get out today? I got out only today, the first time in a week. Don't you want to go home? Why don't you? You're free now. If you want to go home, you can do that now. I can't leave my baby. How old is your baby? 4 months. Did he marry you? No. It's better that way. By the way, how are they doing back home? I don't know. You know, I've written them about 3 times. I sent them money. But Ah Tek hardly entrusts me with money. He gives me some only when I need it. Do they know? In the province? No. I've told them nothing at all about me. They think I live a good life here in Manila. But I've never told them where to write me here. Help me. Help me. Hush now. Don't cry. I'll take care of it. We'll run away. We'll take your baby with us. It's not easy. I tried escaping before. I was caught and that Chinese nearly killed me! He said that if he caught me again, he'd really kill me. I can't take my baby because of the nanny. She sleeps beside my baby. You can always try again. How about tonight? Let's go home together. That's not possible. You don't know Ah Tek, he'd really kill me. If you really want to leave, you mustn't stop trying, no matter what happens to you. You don't know how angry he can get. If you really want to escape, you'll try anything. Nothing else matters. Pity my poor baby, should anything happen to me. If that's how you think, you'll never leave that place. So how about tonight? Ligaya? I'll wait at the Arranque market. It's a good place. Like I'm just waiting for a ride. That's safer than hanging around your house. A cop might notice me. Maybe not tonight. Just try. I'll be waiting whether you come or not. Shall we say midnight? How long will you wait? It's up to you. Until 3:00 a.m. Alright. Nothing? Hey, man! Wake up. - What time is it? - 5:00 p.m. Get dressed, let's see a movie. C'mon, won't take long. Or we could go dancing in Grace Park. I don't know how to dance. Doesn't matter in those places. Just embrace the girl, kiss her neck, caress her thighs and you're set! - No, thanks. - C'mon! You need to relax. If you don't care for Grace Park, there's always Pasay. What are we gonna do there? Women, what else? Just 6 bucks apiece. You scared of women? It's a waste of money. That's why I borrowed some, so we can have a good time. - How much did you borrow? - 30 pesos. You should save it. I still have the 25 you lent me. Don't worry about it. Keep it. Let's just go out and eat. Try the noodles, they're good. For a long life. Just look at those people. You'd think they were deaf. Miss, come here. Can you turn it down? It's too loud. The man who played it might object. Just a bit. Fuck! That's what I hate about this place: that jukebox! We should have gone somewhere else. I like the food here. If it's not the jukebox, it's those English-speaking snobs! Fuck you! You snobs! - Some more beer? - No, I'm set. I'm full. - One more! - No, thanks! You sure? Cigarette? You sure you don't wanna have some fun tonight? Let's just go home. C'mon. Lighten up. I know what's troubling you. It's Ligaya, isn't it? What did that Chinese threaten Ligaya? Killing her. What do you think? Think he meant it? You know, in India, there are people... ...who walk on burning coals, yet they feel no pain. They're called fakirs. Think you can do that? Think you can put out that cigarette on your palm? I'd get burned for sure. Put it out on my palm. You've only had one beer and you're already drunk. Do it. Come on. - No, I won't. - Come on. I can't do it. If you won't... then I will. Ligaya is dead. It says she fell down a flight of stairs and her head hit the concrete floor. But the autopsy showed some bruises on her neck. WHERE IS JUSTICE? This writer is demanding an unbiased investigation. Earlier today, as I was borrowing money, I thought of looking around several funeral homes. I got lucky and found her. They say the burial is tomorrow. At least, that's what I was told. Whatever's on your mind, you need to control yourself. Let's make Ligaya's burial peaceful. Join the struggle! Have no fear! Down with bureaucratic capitalism! Join the struggle! Have no fear! Are you going somewhere? I'll walk around a bit. - Aren't you tired? - No. Here's the money you lent me. Keep it. You may need it. Just return the money. Okay. - Alright, but don't join that! - Don't worry about me. - Sure. - Thanks. Where's Ah Tek? What do you want? Tell him I want to talk to him. Who are you, anyway? Tell him a friend wants to see him. Wait there. Who are you? What do you want? Help! Help! Police! He's got an ice pick! - What's he done? - Killed a Chinese! Let's beat him up! Let's do it! Let's teach him a lesson! He's helpless! Get him! Subtitles: L'Immagine Ritrovata, Bologna
