(heroic orchestral music) - [Narrator] It is spring of 1945. The dream of the Japanese Empire is fading. The great battleship Yamato is caught by an American strike force and he's in desperate need of a safe harbor. There is one island that suits their needs and one man who stands in their way. (light orchestral music) (bell ringing) - Hmm, Sunday... Come on guys, give me a break. This ain't room service. (soft orchestral music) C-41 to Coast Watch. Come in Coast Watch, over. C-41 to-- - [Coast Watch] C-41, we're having trouble reading you. - That's 'cause I'm so far behind you, for Christ's sake. When are you to come and get me, Coast? The war is over, over. - [Coast Watch] Don't you wish! You've got it easy as hell down there, you don't appreciate it. Up here the nips are giving us a really bad time. At least when this war is over your ass will still be in one piece. - Yeah, that's a matter of opinion. I'm going crazy out here. - [Coast Watch] That why you volunteered the first place, jerk. Over and out. - Do you hear that, guys? I asked for this shit. (light orchestral music) Ah, enter Mother Superior from the left of stage. The defiled woman quivers with guilt and remorse, dashing off to the church to wash away her sins. Until the next time. Hallelujah. (crunching) (tense orchestral music) Shit! Coast Watch, Coast Watch, do you read me, over? Come in, dammit. (speaking foreign language) Go! - That you may worthily proclaim His Gospel. - Everybody clear out! - In the name of the Father, and of the Son... - Everybody out! - Mr. Gibb, what are you doing in this church? - Warship in the bay, Father! Japanese troops coming ashore! - Sit, everybody sit! - Come on, come on! - Let's move, we don't have any time! - We're safer in the church! If they fire we're safer here! Everybody stay, stay here! For two years I've been telling you. You and that infernal radio! Didn't I warn you it would bring them here? - I'm sorry. - We always knew it would come to this. (shouting) (energetic drum music) - Oh shit! (guns banging) (tense orchestral music) (speaking foreign language) (tense orchestral music) - Jesus Christ! You... - That's a hell of a way to spread religion, Sister. - They're gone because of you! The Japanese have taken everyone! - I don't have time for this crap. We gotta get out of here. (speaking foreign language) Look, whatever you said is fine with me. Just tell it to the Japs. - Japanese are gone. - That's what they want us to think. Oh no, please, don't help. (pensive orchestral music) Okay when I pull up alongside just stand up and climb in, understand? Do you understand? - Yes. - Take it easy! (shrieking) Take it easy. Wait, wait! Aw, dammit, dammit! Hold it, you'll tip us over. Hang on. God dammit! Gimme your hand! You gotta help me, Sister. Well, we can kiss the Thompson goodbye. (eerie orchestral music) Modern science. Little wind, a few prayers, and we're back in business. - That's why they came, isn't it? To stop the radio. Was it worth it? - Look, so far you've been one major pain in the ass. Don't push it. This is war, Sister. - That's too easy, Mr. Gibb. - Is that so? What I've been doing here is necessary. - Not to Father Fitzpatrick. Not to anyone in the village. - I never heard the island girls complain. - You arrogant conceited man! - Yeah, that's true. And that's on my good days. - [Sister] So what makes you think the Japanese are still on the island? - Too quick, too easy. Doesn't make sense. I was with my father in Nanking when the Japanese invaded in 1937. They killed over 200 thousand people. Officers to bits. Who could cut a man in two with a sword vertically? - You seem to have survived. - My father was the Swedish consul. After the occupation, he got ill. Father Fitzpatrick tried everything but he never recovered. - So you became a nun. - I'm not a nun. Not yet. How long have you been away from civilization? (whispering) - Civilization is different things to different people. - You live in marriage? - She died two years ago leaving England. Her ship was torpedoed. - So that's the reason you're here? - Lady, I'm the reason I'm here. (tense orchestral music) Shit! (shouting) Geez, lady! (intense orchestral music) Help me! Dammit woman, help me! Japs hit the island yesterday. I got one radio, cleared everybody out. It's just me and a woman from the mission. - One objective, C-41. - Listen, asshole. - The Japs are trying to shut me down permanent. They're trying to secure the island, now you gotta get us out of here. - [North] Gibb, this is Major North. - Sir? - [North] Three nights ago we had a run-in with the battleship Yamato 300 miles off sea. We figure it's hit and hit bad. She'll be needing some repairs, looking for deep water cover like that bay you've got down there. We need your eyes there, Gibb. We've gotta find that bastard and deep six it. - Sir, you're not listening. The Japs are here now for whatever reason to finish me. - [North] We can't cover every damn foot of beach in the whole South Pacific, asshole. You're on your own 'til we can get there to you. Got it? Until then, keep us posted. Gibb, do you read? Over. Come in-- - They're not coming in, are they? - We're going in. - In? But why? - Because if there are more of them, they'll be coming after their dead friend back there. - But they'll have to cross the water to get to us. We'll see them. - We just got lucky, Sister. - Lucky? (tense orchestral music) (snake hissing) (gasping) - I'm not gonna hurt you, but they will. You're making too much noise. Watch me. Watch the jungle. Got it? When they come, be very fast. Stay close, be quiet. Not far now. - You said that three hours ago. (energetic drum music) - Move, Sister! Sister, not a good time for this. - How much further, Mr. Gibb? - Round there. (gasping) (shouting) (intense orchestral music) (yelling) (tense orchestral music) - Mr. Gibb, Mr. Gibb. Are you all right? (screaming) Come on. Those shots will bring others. (light orchestral music) - [Sister] What if they find us? - [Gibb] They're close. (shouting) - What is it? - You look... Better. - How long have we got to stay here? - Until they quit. - That could be a long time. - What do you make of this? - Traditional sword hilt. Sword, which gives life. Blade, which kills. They're still samurai at heart. It's more than a weapon. The only truly honorable way to fight, and die. - The only honorable way to fight is to live. (speaking foreign language) (clattering) Hey... Psst, psst! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! No, no. Psst, hey! Oh shit. (intense orchestral music) (gun banging) (light orchestral music) I'm gonna regret this. - Don't you need this? - Not as much as you do. - Thank you. - [Gibb] Why a nun? - My father wasn't a passionate man. Father Fitzpatrick was different. He has a burning passion for everything. I like that. I began to think a vocation was the most important thing in the world. Now sometimes I catch myself trying to bargain with it. I've promised anything to be free. His answer always seems to be the same. All he wants... Is what I'm afraid to give. Myself. - By the way, Sister... What is your name? - Katherine. Kate. - Nice. Nice. (tense orchestral music) C-41 to Coast Watch. Do you read me, over? Coast Watch, Coast Watch, do you copy, over? Son of a bitch! Batteries didn't charge long enough. There must be some kind of time table to all this. They're bringing in the Yamato. They'll be here soon. - The Yamato? - Biggest battleship ever built. - But why here? - Bay's deep water. May be hit, need repairs. Good a place as any. - I see. Then they must kill us. (light instrumental music) - No! - You know I have to. - Hungry now, but by night they'll be climbing the walls. Gotta go when I can still think straight. - Please don't. - You know how to use this? Hammer back, safety on. You have to use it, safety off, pull the trigger. - There must be another way. Wait. You'll need this. What if he comes? - Shoot the bastard. (tense orchestral music) (speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) (soft orchestral music) (speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) - Son of a bitch! (speaking foreign language) (dramatic instrumental music) (yelping) (speaking foreign language) Go screw yourself. (speaking foreign language) You want exercise, jerk off. Up yours! Okay, okay... (tense drum music) Don't get too excited, Tojo. (speaking foreign language) Water... (speaking foreign language) Water! (speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) (tense orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music) (booming) Kate? (speaking foreign language) (light orchestral music) - Don't leave me again. Never. - Come on, it's not safe here. - Never. - Never. - [Kate] How long will it take? - One, two hours. Should be enough charge. - The battle could be over by then. - That battle and this one have very little to do with each other. He's not gonna surrender. He's gonna die here. Try and take me with him. I want you to stay here out of sight. (gasping) (soft orchestral music) - Kiss me. (dramatic orchestral music) - He's here. I'm not leaving you. But we have to deal with this. One at a time. Here. Take it. If anything comes through that doorway that isn't me, shoot it. - Please... (rustling) (dramatic orchestral music) (shouting) (speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) - Please! Don't. (speaking foreign language) (booming) (speaking foreign language) (light instrumental music) (shouting) (dramatic instrumental music)
