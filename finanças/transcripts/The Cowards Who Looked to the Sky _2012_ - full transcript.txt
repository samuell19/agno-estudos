Have you been a good girl, Anzu? Yes, my Muramasa. Oh, Muramasa! "Powerless, Anzu embraces Muramasa…" "Powerless, Anzu embraces Muramasa…" I'm gonna cum! I'm gonna cum! I'm gonna cum! I'm gonna cum! I'm… cumming! Oh, Muramasa… No, wait… I can't… hold back. I'm gonna cum. Cum inside me. "Have you been a good girl Anzu?" "Yes, my Muramasa…" Muramasa moves his hand up Anzu's skirt… I can't wait until you're on winter break. Why? So we can be together from the morning. - Stop it. - Are you ticklish? It'll get hard again. That's okay. Hey… Is it okay?… Me never using condoms. Don't worry. It's okay. I know my cycle. Yeah, but… If it happens, I'll have the baby. I'm just kidding. My husband will be home soon. Anzu. Hey! (Fugainai Boku wa Sora wo Mita) --- - THE COWARDS WHO LOOKED TO THE SKY - --- Takumi… I really like you. What do you think of me? Aren't I good enough? No, it's not like that. But… could you give me some time? You're already dating someone? Don't worry about that. I… feel the same way about you. It's time for home-room! Take your seats! I'm handing out the end-of-term schedule. That sucks! Nana?… said that to you? Yeah… When? Earlier today. Before home-room. No way… You gotta be kidding me. A chick you like confessing she likes you first? That's awesome. 'Awesome' is a little over the top. Oh, so that's how it's gonna be. You won't have time to hang out. Say what? Am I outta line? Won't she be waiting? You have to walk her home, right? No, it's not like that. I haven't said yes, yet. Are you nuts? Because… there's this thing… What thing? What? Of course I will. Hey! I'm asking you not to. Okay, okay. Don't worry. The break's over, Fukuda. Rearrange the beverages. Okay. See ya later. Oh, wait… My mom said you can call her anytime. - Okay. - Later. A free hand-out? Hey, shut up. It's got nothing to do with you. Fukuda. Liquor section. Okay. Whoa, it sounds like a porno movie. She's really getting drilled! She wants to come out. Just a little more! You can do it. Sorry, are you okay? I'm fine. Try to calm down. Okay. You're doing fine. You got a minute? People think we're watching porn in here. Never mind. Just help. Hurry. Chizuru. Excuse me. I'm back. The sacrum, the sacrum. I know, okay? I know what to do. I'm sorry only my foolish son is available. Not at all. He's very skilled… "I'm waiting for you. The key's in the usual place." Are you a Lyrica (anime) fan? Not especially. They're not that popular anymore. You two are hardcore. That's not true. There are still lots of fans. Right? It's his first time at a convention. He'd make a good Muramasa. Don't you think? Yeah. Takumi as Muramasa? We're childhood friends and nobody's ever said that. Your name's Takumi? I'm Yoshikawa. You two are great as Lyrica and Muramasa. Thanks. This might sound a bit strange but can you take a photo with us? Seriously? I was gonna ask the same thing. Over here. Is here good? I'll take it. Yes, please. Ready? Say 'cheese'. Get it? - Can you take one? - Yeah, sure. Here we go… 'Cheese'. Is it okay? Yes, thank you. Shall I send it to you? Of course! You, too? Well, okay… I'll send it now. What's your address? Hold on a sec… I'm sending it. Where'd you come from today? Kawanobe City. Whereabouts? Kita Izumi. Me, too… It's over. No… Later. I said no. No. This is no good. No. Hey… Hey! Think of your husband. No. You can't. Anzu, you're just buying me with money! No! It's over! Ow, shit! Is it all my fault? Damn you! I know you'll be back! You'll be back! God-damn you! Um… Not outside. Your mom's a midwife, right? Yeah. And your dad? What does he do? I dunno. Seriously? I wanna be a midwife someday. No sleep, no holidays, no money. It sucks. But I really love babies. That doesn't mean you can handle the job. I didn't mean you. My mom always says that. We want to have this baby as naturally as possible. And… I want to avoid fish and meat for the baby's sake. And… I heard that you pay proper attention to… …thanks… meal preparation here, so I'd like you to use the organic vegetables I usually order. I don't mean to scare you, but our number one concern are the lives of you and your baby. If we can't manage the birth you'll be brought to a hospital we're associated with. Please understand that. We're not having this baby in a hospital. Not to worry. We understand… Please follow your current diet, and I'm sure with your eagerness you know this, but walk as much as possible and ensure you stay warm. Okay? While you're here, we'll do our best to meet your needs. But can you promise us one thing? Yes. It's not a big issue. Starting today, please cut down on the internet. Your eyes get more tired during pregnancy. Oh, I see. And do you know the most important thing for a child? Parents who love each other. As her husband, please support your wife as best you can. Right, of course. Your baby 'sees' everything, from inside your belly. If I follow all the rules, this baby will be born naturally, right? Don't you want to just tell them the truth? It pisses me off when they go on about 'natural'. Mixing childbirth and 'natural' this, 'slow life' that, it's no good. I'd be a lot stricter. If they'd at least listen to the info in prenatal class. Spending too much time on each person becomes impractical. That time should be spent on the birth itself. You're actually pretty harsh… about the 'net. Someone as naive as her takes it as gospel. Once they get bad info it's hard to undo. Worrying about things that are one in a million. Actually, you're downright sinister. Silly. We have to put food on the table, too. Right? What do you want for dinner? Whatever. 'Whatever' is hard to buy. Just hurry up. I need some tampons. Ugh. Yes? It's… me. Use your tongue more. I want you. I can't hold back. I love you… Anzu. And I love you. Huh? Not so yummy. "From that day forth, Anzu filled my thoughts." Regarding the artificial insemination, it's the 2nd day of your menstrual cycle and there's still been no conception. In your case, your fallopian tubes are quite narrow, Satomi. Another cause for your fertility issues is your husband's sperm. His count is low, and the sperm are lacking motility. It seems to be your husband's condition behind this issue. ♬"Parallel Princess, next level!" ♬"Parallel Princess, next level!" ♬"I'm not who I was yesterday." ♬"Princess of love!" I could hear you singing all the way outside. Oh, welcome back! I didn't even notice. Dinner? Hamburger steak? It's already prepared. I just have to fry it. 20 minutes? Okay. By the way… Yeah? The artificial insemination didn't work. You can let my mom know. A baby… with DNA from two bullied kids like us would never make it. Goodnight. Oh, good morning. Good morning. I bought vegetables at the market. Here. - I'll take this. - Thank you. Breakfast at this time? So late. We sleep in on Sundays. It looks good. It could use some vegetables. Let's use these. I'll wash them. No, I'll take care of it. Housewives need Sundays off. Go take a rest. Thank you. All ready. Here we are. That smell brings back memories. Waking up at such an hour. You can't leave it all up to Satomi. Men do housework these days, too. I do my share. Right? Let's eat. The vegetables are delicious. Bon appétit. Bon appétit… Mmm, good. Oh, almost forgot. Here… Pickled egg juice. Heard of it? Never. Silkie fowl eggs pickled in vinegar. You remember your old classmate Keiko? A neighborhood friend's daughter drank it and got pregnant, so I thought it might work for you. Here. Drink it now? Of course, now. All in one gulp is best. If your mother had been alive when you were young she could've provided nutrition like this. Everybody said getting married at 20 was a bad idea. Two years later, they were divorced. Was there a reason? Mainly an affair. Yoshiko, my friend… it was her daughter's fault, too. Neglecting her child? No time to play the field before they got married. It was the worst ending to a shotgun marriage. Then her daughter started working. She left her baby with Yoshiko every day. It was doubtful whether she was actually working… Poor kid. Yoshiko's the one raising her now. It's unbelievable, being her first grandchild. She puts on new clothes and shoes, and takes her out to show her off. Children are not pets, are they? So… you should try in-vitro fertilization. Actually, we're not… Oh, don't tell me! You're worried about money. Don't fret about that. My late husband left us enough. If I use it for my grandchild he can't say anything. We should try everything. Once upon a time, a wife who didn't bear a child for three years was told to get out. If that was the case… we should've had your body examined by a doctor. That way… I'm really sorry, Machiko. - Thank you. - Over here, please. Another pose, please. Anzu, look, look! That guy in the checkered shirt. On the right. He'd be a perfect Muramasa! I want to dress him up in this! Talk to him, then. No way, you know I can't. I'm too shy! Oh crap, here he comes! Hello. You didn't get lost? I didn't recognize you out of costume. Wow… This is really embarrassing. No, you look fantastic. Could you come here? Okay. Good. Now from this angle. Face this way. Is this fun for you? It's my escape from reality. No, don't look at that. Please… Why not? You have talent. No, really. You won't laugh? There's nothing funny about your pictures. Okay. When did you draw it? In college. This is the best Muramasa I've ever drawn. It's true. He's my dream man. Please be a little more gentle. It's before my period. Sorry… Get undressed. Just a moment. I can't hold it. You can cum. It's okay, don't worry. Cum. Will you see me again? Will you? Yeah. "Slutty pig!" "Disgusting geek" "Pervert!" "You'll do it with anyone." "Don't spread your disease, whore!" To aid embryo development, stimulation is employed to increase fertilization chances. To induce ovulation… Clomiphene is taken orally and there are injections. Ultimately the follicle count will increase, as you see here. Open your hand. Apply pressure on the cotton, please. Open your hand, please. You'll feel a prick now. - Are your legs feeling numb? - Yes. Women have to keep this part warm. How do you know that? My mother… What about your mother? Nothing. Don't. When you laugh it vibrates inside. I'm extracting the egg now. Just a moment. All right, please stay still. It's coming. Here it comes. 125.68, Doctor. It… didn't work. Hello? What's wrong with you? I never should've let you marry my son. But Kei'ichiro was set on it. So I turned a blind eye to your past. My past? Money can buy anything. I know everything about you. All of it. What you were called in school. But Kei'ichiro still wanted to marry you. All I wanted was a grandchild. Why can't you give me that? Not being able to have a child isn't only my fault. Kei'ichiro also has… How dare you say that! He works so hard every day to put food on the table for you. These days both people work, with mothers raising more than one kid. And you? No job. You can't cook. You can't have kids. We chose a loser! You blame my son?! You need to be a better wife! Say something! You blame us for everything! I always knew you were useless. Defective goods! Poor Kei'ichiro! Satomi? Please leave me alone. Sorry. ♬"Parallel Princess, next level…" ♬"Parallel Princess, next level." ♬"Parallel Princess, next level!" ♬"Parallel Princess, next level!" ♬"Parallel Princess, next level!" Muramasa! Anzu's been waiting for you like a good girl. Muramasa… It's over. No… Later. I said no. Don't. This is no good. No. Hey… No! Hey! Think of your husband. No. You can't. Anzu, you're just buying me with money! No! It's over! Ow, shit! Is it all my fault? Damn you! I know you'll be back! You'll be back! God-damn you! Wow, a real princess! Look, Mommy. A princess! I'm back. Machiko. Muramasa… Muramasa… Without kids, this is what happens… Oh, God. Muramasa… A woman with too much time on her hands gets up to no good. It's been a long time since Kei'ichiro noticed your strange behavior. You never realized that? But he has no intention of separating from you. We're still going to find a way to get that baby. If I could have done it myself, I would've had your baby. I'm sorry, Machiko-san, but please let me get divorced! They have great hospitals in America. There are coordinators here who can help find a surrogate mother. But first, we'll all fly to America so you both can get tested. And don't worry a thing about money. I won't divorce you! If you do, I'll leak this video everywhere! To his house, the school… The whole world! Yes? It's… me. Use your tongue more. I want you. Can't hold it. I love you… Anzu. And I love you. "A new life created from sex so pleasurable," "is truly a miracle." Grandma! Grandma! You can't eat that, okay? Come on, spit it out. Just put it down. Down. "Takako" "Ms. Takako Fukuda: Notice Regarding Course Fees" "Electricity 517" "National Pension" "Marutake Loan Co." What the hell are your parents doing?! I can't even get a hold of them at dinner time! Hey… This convenience store ain't your fridge? Got it? Good evening. Taoka. They're shoplifting again. You should scold them. I can't do it. You worked at a cram school, right? No can do. I worked at a prep school. My students were high-schoolers. Dammit. What's with these punks from that 'ghetto'? Sorry. I don't wanna say this but, since you started here, these kiddie shoplifters have increased. It might be a coincidence, but don't be filling their heads. I can't take anymore of these punks. Shit-head. We're not their guardians. Hey… Have you heard from Takumi? What about him? Have you seen him recently? I've been busy here. He hasn't come to school recently. I thought you might know since you're good friends. We look that way? You're not? You like him or something? Huh? No? What? Ain't that why you're asking? That pervert? Whatever. Wait a second. Don't steal again. Take this stuff with you. Thank you. Thank you. See ya. What's this about? My big sis likes anime… Does she? She makes fanzines and stuff. It's super geeky. Anyway, she found something on a message forum. Here. Wanna see? Yeah. Is that Takumi? Looks like it. He hasn't been at school. Maybe that's why? You know that character? I don't really know about anime. It's called Magic Girl or something. Some old TV show. It still has fan sites. According to my sis, this was sent to them with his name and address. Did he send it by himself? Nobody would do that themselves. And… what's really crazy is the video… Like a porno? My sis said the women dating him might've sent it. By the way, how are things going between you? Well… It seemed like it was going okay for a while… Don't. I didn't mean to hurt you. I'm sorry! It was my fault. I'll throw it… Can I have it? And the website address. You wanna see it? Yeah. Oh, okay… Sure. Because I still like him. What a nut. He's totally lost it. Filming sex is gross. His life's over. Imagine if he came to school in that costume? Oh, Muramasa! He's coming for sure. No way. I'll bet 1,000 yen he's not. He'll definitely be here. For sure! No way! He can't. Hey, put 'em in here. Teacher asked me to collect them. Is Takumi quitting school? "Cosplay Sex: Mr. T.S. from K*** High School." What is it? More of those e-mails? Yep. "Your son's a pervert!" "The world doesn't need scum like him, you understand?" And this was in the mail box. Oh, God. He's just a kid. What? Good afternoon. May I come in? Ryo. Good afternoon. Miss Nomura. Is Takumi here? What was he thinking? Thanks again for the lunches. Takumi? I'm coming in. The shit's really hit the fan. Someone leaked a photo of you doing weird cosplay. Who's that woman? "Muramasa!" Oi! Well… the reason is… I mean… The fool. He'll be down soon. I didn't know you were pregnant. When's the baby due? What? The delivery date? Huh? What?! How? How'd you know I was pregnant?! Your belly… But I haven't told anybody. What? Have you seen a doctor? Just once. When I missed my period… Are you keeping records. I'm not even sure I'll marry my boyfriend yet. Does he know? You should discuss it with him and get a check-up at the hospital. Then we can offer you help. No way, I can't do it! I can't bear pain or needles. Don't you get it, woman?! You don't just have a quickie abortion anymore, stupid! Once you get pregnant, you should have the baby. Mitsuyo, you're going too far! How come she's so scary? Because you're a bimbo! With teachers like you, Japan is screwed. How can you say that? I can take care of you if you deliver it here. You're too strict… I just came by to see how Takumi was doing. Fukuda. Isn't this yours? Oh, just throw it away. Your sentences are a mess, with basic mistakes. But if you improve your spelling and idioms you could get 20 more points. You're spelling junior high-level words wrong. Did you mean 'another'? This says 'anatar'. Bring your textbook. I can teach you on break. Nah. I hate studying. You shouldn't say that in 2nd year. You still have time for university exams. I'm not going to university. I've got no money. Never mind money. There are scholarships and grants. There's plenty of ways. Plenty of people can't get jobs even though they went to university. Right now, you really don't have anything. Your parents aren't rich, and you have no special talents. So at least get your degree. Do you know the job rate for high school grads? Lessons must be boring when you don't get it. They're boring, period. That's when I sleep, after my newspaper job. Teachers are just no-brains. At my high school, the teachers and the students are all shit-heads. I can imagine. If you just graduate from your stupid high school, you'll have a shotgun wedding and keep pumping out babies. You'll have an asshole boss like our manager and stay in that 'ghetto'. But that's not so bad, right? No way I'd take that shit! Okay, then. Let's study. Fukuda… What do you keep smiling about? I'm not smiling. You're happy Taoka's worried about you. Be careful, though. That's how he gets close. You don't know? He's a homo. The son of a rich hospital owner and working at a convenience store? It's weird. He's fishing for boys. Do you have proof? You had the same look when you were in elementary school. You're all happy that you would have a new dad. He never came. You're no better. Where'd your 'company president' old man end up after all? Right back here. Whatever… I don't care what you believe. However much we struggle, We'll never escape this dump. Those… give me half. You're no good. Really useless. I ate all the rice in the cooker. Ryota, that cash I gave you. I need it back. I'll return it. Hello? Is Takako Fukuda there? Hello? Sorry… she's not here. She hasn't been back for three days. When she comes back, tell her to settle her debt by the end of this month. Who are you? Her son? Yeah. I see. Tough break. Good luck. Are you okay? You can come to his apartment to live with us. What about Grandma? She's your dad's mom. I don't have any obligations to take care of her. Leave her here. Eventually she'll… Hey? Where's my bank-book for all my New Year's savings? I'll give it to you when you turn 20. I've been saving it all since you were a kid. I'll crash here tonight. I have a morning shift at the factory. It's closer from here. Every human being is unique. Nobody can be the same as you. Nobody can replace you. Each and every person has their own individuality. That individuality shouldn't be judged by anybody. Each person's uniqueness is wonderful. Right. We should respect Takumi's individuality, too. Aoki, give this to the teacher. You do it! You're good at stuff like that. Tell her we have a student with wonderful individuality. Do it now. Okay, I'm going. Idiot, I was just joking! What a big-mouth. … Let's appreciate your parents and your friends. Take it easy. Stop it, Fukuda! Hey, cut it out! I said stop it! God only tests people he believes can overcome tribulations. Ryo, what happened to your face? Don't act like you're the only one having it tough. Enjoying cosplay… Fucking her… Your video was leaked. Stupid asshole. Just die if you want. Hey… Why'd you have me? It was an accident, right? You should've had an abortion. Because you didn't want to be a bad person? Don't have me for your convenience. No food for bums. Hey, Fukuda. Welcome back. What the hell are you gonna do now? Everything's soaking wet. Your grandma left the faucet on, and threw buckets of water everywhere! My tatami mats are ruined. I don't give a fuck about your place. What about my damage? I'm very sorry. You old bitch! I'll chuck you in the river. I'm really sorry. Forgive us. I want compensation. Just forget it. My room is fucked up. I'll clean the rest myself. I'll wipe the floor. You can't do it by yourself. It was on the door handle. Don't worry, the manager's not with me. She should be in hospital. My hospital has good facilities. You can't control her. I can't afford it. I've kept telling you. When you need help, call me. Why? Why are you helping me? Is it like a hand-out? I'm… a hideous person. So the rest of the time, I should do something extra good. Anyway, you guys should stop spreading that photo. Akutsu left a copy in the store machine. If you have that much time, think about how to get out of that place. Going to university… think about it. "Convenience store worker arrested for child molestation" "Convenience store worker arrested for child molestation" He was taking his counseling seriously. "Convenience store worker arrested for child molestation" He himself knew most that he needed help. He was crying. I don't believe that. The writer of the article is the one who's suspicious. I'll take out the garbage. He didn't touch you, right? "Mission to raise Fukuda's test score! English vocabulary - Test 10" There's only idiots in this town. He said he'd teach them, but dragged them to his car and took photos of them naked. Disgusting! And scary. Imagine, someone like that living around here… Were you hit? Don't touch me, pervert! I prayed to a mean-spirited God. Please don't leave him out in the cold tonight. "To: Mr. Takumi Saito" "To: Mr. Takumi Saito" Did you order the childbirth package? Yes, I did. What happened? Takumi… It's an urn. "Bones of Anzu's and your baby" Waist, 85cm. Uterine fundus, 30cm. Are those… really from Takumi's. Of course not. Maybe fried chicken bones or something. When they're washed they look pretty real, huh? I threw them out. What a horrible thing to do. I'm glad it's garbage day. I can't believe there are people who've never been stupid in love. Exercising? As you told me to. I'm walking every day. You're not overweight. It looks good. Thank you very much. Mitsuyo. Please sit up slowly. Easy does it now. Um, by the way… The timing's not good with Takumi having trouble, but… Well… I've decided to marry my boyfriend. Wow! Congratulations! It's all thanks to Mitsuyo. Mitsuyo? We took him out and convinced him to marry her. Or else vasectomy time. Is that how you 'convince'? It worked. Mitsuyo… Thanks to her, we're tying the knot. Making threats. I'm doing a pelvic exam. Okay. 2 to 3cm. Bring her forward. That's good. Opaque amniotic fluid. Understood. Mrs. Nishimura, can you turn on your side? That's it… we'll help you up. It must be painful. You're really doing well… But your baby must be getting tired. Just in case, let's go to the hospital. I'll call an ambulance. This will be a bit cold. That's why I told you to have the baby at a hospital, not this weird place! Let's think of your wife and baby's safety first. Are you okay? How are you doing, Mrs. Nishimura? Mrs. Nishimura? First child? Yes. Her amniotic fluid is opaque… It seems like the delivery will take longer. I understand. We'll take care of it from here. Thank you very much. Big talk about 'natural childbirth' but your patients still end up here. If something happens to the baby, it's your fault! Prepare her for surgery. Doctor… Aya… You'll see your baby soon. I didn't make it. Having a baby by C-section… I'm a failed mother. What are you saying?! You did well. You're going to be a mother. Be strong. To the operating room. Please take care of her. Thank God. Aya's birth went well. Mitsuyo, being a midwife is… not only about bringing a healthy baby into the world. When I worked at the hospital, I saw more children die than I expected. I did all I could do, but some babies died right after being born. When I think of those cold, hard babies' corpses, I can't sleep. But that wasn't your fault. I think that was just their life-span. If I don't… If that's true… If their life-span’s so short, why are they even born in the first place? I really wish somebody could help me understand the meaning their short lives had. Truly. Hello? Saito Maternity Center. This is the last time. Sorry. Hows Takumi doing? Why don't you find out? I'm useless as a father. Then don't ask me such a thing! "Cosplay Housewife", "Pervert's House", "Get out!" I'm going to America. America? Yes. Which part? West Virginia. Transfer? We're going there to meet a person having a baby. Baby? Whose? Mine and yours. I'm joking. Someone who might be able to have a baby for me and my husband. Don't go! Why? You can't! Don't go! Thank you for everything. No… Don't! Why? Don't go. Don't leave me! Okay? It's time… you went home. "Takumi, I'm very sorry. Even though I'm a stupid, perverted housewife" "who can't have a baby. Thank you so much for being with me. Anzu" I come here to pray, and meet my own son. What are you praying for? For children. Of course, including you. All children. Babies who will be born, babies who couldn't be born. All babies who are alive and dead. Mom… I'm sorry. You don't need to apologize to anybody. Takumi. Don't give up. You're one of the living. Be alive… and be here. "God, please protect this baby" Good morning. Good morning. School? Yeah. I'm off. See you. Muramasa! "Do we really choose the lives we lead?" You should use an emoticon. Don't peek at my phone. Liar. You're talking crap. The test. You did it? You did? Me, too. Don't worry. It'll be okay. Thank you. And, exhale… Inhale, through your nose… Good. Exhale once more. And inhale again… through your nose. Good… and push. Doctor… I can't take it. You're doing great. I can almost see the baby's head. Just push a few more times and the baby will arrive. Hang in there. Takumi, water. You'll meet your baby soon. Your husband's helping, too. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale once more. Inhale slowly. And push! Good. Yes, I can see the head! Stop pushing now. The shoulder's out now. The shoulder's out. Your baby's here! Congratulations! You did it, Chie. You really did great! He's a healthy boy. You were amazing. I'm so glad you can finally meet. You were great. I'll put a cushion under you. Okay. Takumi, the futon. Futon? This one? Yes. Here. You did great. If you feel nauseous or that you're bleeding a lot, please call on us. I will. You… were born with a devil of a thing.
