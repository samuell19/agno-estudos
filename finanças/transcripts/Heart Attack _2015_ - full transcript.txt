Individuals should sleep at least 6-8 hours a day. - Ministry of Public Health - That's stupid. We can go without sleep for at least 2 days! I did. It's day 3. Day 3 See, I am still okay. I'm not dead but it's day 3. So my body is heating up a little bit. Cooling down now. Last time was also like this. Je, just wait. I just need another 10 seconds. 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 HEART ATTACK Why are you here? Four hours left. The client has been calling non-stop. How many photos left? Seven Seven photos. How many minutes per photo? I don't know. 7 photos, 4 hours. We won't make it. Just call and postpone. We can postpone it won't look bad. Seriously. I will call them now. Je don't. No dude. I accepted the job. I must do it in time. They're making you do too much. How many times have we fixed it? Not just 1 or 2 times. That's not the point. For real, you think you can finish it? I don't know. I promised them so I will get it done. So you won't postpone, right? Right. You'll make it? Yeah. Okay. Hey stop being paranoid. I'm about to unlock my new power. What the hell kind of power? Anything to eat? I don't know. Je doesn't know that I'm unlocking my new power in 3 seconds. 3 2 1 The 96 hour mark. We can go without sleep for 4 days for real! Day 4 Je, I'm finished. Je, wake up. Wake up. C'mon! Hurry. Wake up. Yoon, I've seen it. It's marvelous. There's no time. My boss won't change anything. I think it's alright. But still not right. But we fixed according to the brief already. Yes, I know but... It can look more than this. I think it can be more high-end . Honestly, are you happy? Do you really like it? So how should it look? Hey that's your job, not mine. Why am I hiring you then? Right? I'll be back to have a look. Make it quick. Yoon. Shit. Make it more high-end within an hour. Paragon Fifth Avenue Champs-Elysees Almost done? The print shop will give our slot away. Done? Just a bit more. Yoon! Stop fixing it already. It's already perfect. We won't make it. It doesn't look like the first brief at all. Well... It's a lot better. I love it. Print it. Good work. If you ever quit working freelance, come see me. I'm feeling warm. It's so romantic. This time I feel like I disarmed a bomb. Excuse me. Your food is here. Je, what's the date today? 27th. Your brain it's all gone. It's my friend's dad's funeral. Shit, should I go? What did he die of? He died of old age. That's all. That's okay, right? Not like dying tragically in a car accident. Pass him an envelope with 2,000 THB in it. And that's okay? Yeah. This is my close friend's dad. You have close friends? Of course. Pongsatorn. When was the last time you met up? I don't know. I forgot. Close friend huh? Ask him first if you're his close friend? Of course, I am. I don't know. But the deadline is 8PM. I forwarded the file to you already. You have 5 hours left. If you were me, would you go? If I was to make up an excuse, what excuse? I don't want, I'm sick or too busy. So? I don't know. - I only know your deadline is 8PM, I got to go. - Wait. Where are you going? Going to the office. Pongsatorn, I'm sorry. Does this temple have WiFi? Damn Yoon. What the hell for? I have to send my work from here. Gosh, what's the matter with you? C'mon don't be upset. I'm sorry. I really have to. I don't know. Go ask the monk over there. Good evening. Does this temple have WiFi? Oh you can use the one from my dwelling. Alright. Server: Kaewking Temple Dwelling 1 WiFi. Password? The password is 'Indiansubcontinent79'. How do you spell that? I finished it in the taxi ride here. But I just got WiFi and charged my battery. Uploaded already. Just check it. Alright. Pongsatorn. Please don't be sad. Death is part of the natural life cycle of this planet. If you're not free for my funeral, don't come. I am sorry man. Yoon, I gotta call you every time for your cheques. Do you want your money? I'm sorry. I'm very busy. Here. Your cheques are about to expire. Oh. Thank you. All done. Wow lots of cheques. Keeping them must be hard. Hey Peng, hello. Hello. I wasn't free. That's why there're so many. How are you? I heard you stayed awake for 4 days? 4 and a half days. Oh really. I think in Je's line of work. Three days is enough. You're getting old now, you know. You're right. I guess. Hello. Hey just in time. Jerd, this is Yoon your idol. Hello Yoon. Hello. Talk to him. Meeting him in person is not easy. Yoon, in school I studied your work quite often. You inspired me a lot. Wow thank you. So does he work for you now? Not yet. I met him at a competition. His work is good so I approached him. I wanted to get to know him. Sounds familiar. Actually when I met Jerd, I thought of you. He is hard working just like you. When I saw his pimples I could tell. Keep it up. I might send some work your way. Thank you. Thank you. Peng, I have to go. I've got work to finish. Sure. Peng, if you have any work, just send it over. I've been wanting to work with you. Sure. I'll ring you. Alright. Bye. Hey Yoon. What's wrong with your neck? Shit! What the heck is it? Rash: 2 spots Damn! My work speed has decreased 10%. Scratching like this wastes a lot of damn time. Gosh how annoying! Rash: 2.5 spots Yes? I'm not in front of the computer. Okay. How is the feedback in general? Okay. Oh. Uh huh. So do I have to fix anything? Sure. I can jot it down. Okay shoot. I think you should check on the other stuff first. When I get back, I will get it done. Oh, so you decided to go with the 1st draft? And what about the 15th draft that I did? 6,785 THB. Let me call you back. Wrong patient? Mr. Assanai Srisiri, correct? Yes. 6,785 THB. Do you have health insurance? No, I don't. Then 6,785 THB. 1,500 THB. Paracetamol, I have at home. 3,285 THB. 2,000 THB. Damn it's all gone. I just got this cheque. Take before bedtime (May make you sleepy). Shit 7,000 THB. I better take it then! Je. Sup? Send me June's photo now. Her tummy is hard to retouch. Okay. Just a sec. Wait, just one sec. I'll send it by 9AM. Damn elephant tranquilizers. Rash: 2.5 spots Shit! Rash: 4 spots Damn! It's spreading. What the hell! Why a turtleneck? Cold? I'm using a Mac. Steve Jobs died you know. I want to look cool. Can't I? A turtle neck in the wrong season. Chicks won't dig it. It's a giveaway too. Leave me alone! Just so you know. I don't know about everybody else, but if you're sick, I won't give you any jobs. And what's wrong with your finger? Rash: 5 spots Shit. The thing on my neck is just a warning, right? Kidney disease. Mosquito borne tropical diseases. Drug allergies. Can lead to death. Shit. What the hell is wrong with me! Public hospitals are cheaper. The doctors are more experienced. Get treated here and get better. Contact the Dermatology Institute. Dermatology Institute. 6:00 AM. But save up to 7,000 THB. Dermatology Institute. Excuse me. Where is the registration? Booth 4, the next one over. Shit! I didn't get here early enough, right? Number 15. Number 15. Number 16. Number 16. Gosh another 159 queues. Number 177. Number 177. Number 177. Number 177? 175, I called 10 times. You have to wait. Your file is in the records room. You just passed my number by two queues. Mr. 175, don't be selfish. Sit and wait. I will call you again. And please pay attention. Number 178. Number 178. Gosh! If I just paid 7,000 THB, I'd be done already. Who said we can't buy time! Shit this is a real waste my time. Actually, in 3 hours I could remove 20 pimples. Retouch another 30 boobs. Damn! Forget this! Number 175. Number 175. I'm 175. Please go to room number 5. Damn doc, if I don't get better! Good morning. Good morning. What's your name? Assanai. Surname? Srisiri. Je. If you pick it up, I won't examine you, ok? Okay. So what's matter? I have a rash on my arms and neck. Let me see. Also on my fingers. Okay. For how long now? For a while. What's your occupation? I'm a graphic designer. Graphic designer? So you are around ink all the time, right? Oh not that kind. I work on a computer. I do retouching. Like resizing boobs for magazines, something like that? I also remove pimples and stuff too. Whose boobs are the hardest to work on? I'm not at liberty to say. So you've seen a lot of boobs then? Guys like you are good at... that program Photo...don't scratch it. Photoshop, right? Yes. I tried to use it, but it's hard. You use Photoshop too? What for? You know sometimes I have pimples and I have to post my photo. So you know, it's embarrassing. But in the end, I didn't know how to use it. To remove pimples, use the Clone Stamp. See. Over my head. It's not hard. Yes, it is. Let me see your fingers. Are you still studying? Oh yes. Doing my specialty training. If you don't feel comfortable, you can change doctors. Oh it's not like that. I thought doctors are older. But you're not. Let me have a look. So you don't really sleep much, do you? How do you know? It's obvious. Just looking at your eyes. I can tell. Shit! Why am I feeling shy? Stop sweating right now. Please stop. Are you hot? Huh? Are you hot? Because... you're sweating. Am I? Yes. I don't know. You really are not well. Now, pull up your t-shirt. Why? I have to examine you. Don't be shy. It's okay. Pull it up. This is the most f*cked up moment in my life. You said it was only on your neck and hands. You scratched here, right? Rash: 13 spots Yeah you scratched. Look at that. Shit, I wish I could do some sit-ups right now. Are you itching anywhere else? Yeah that's it, just on my arms like I said. How about your penis? It's important. Oh man... C'mon. A penis is also an appendage. Just like our arms and legs. No, it's not. How is it alike? I will do an Infographic for you later. Hey you're already 30 years old. It's all the same. It's just a sore. Don't worry. I've seen over a thousand penises. I'm okay. I've seen only one penis. I'm not okay. We're very busy here. Lots of patients are waiting outside. I understand. See it is the same as here. You see it, right? They are all the same, doc. Hmm... okay. What's okay, doc? Gosh! A man getting raped must feel like this. Did you get raped or something? Shit! She could hear my thoughts? All done. Next checkup is next month, ok? Next month? My schedule is always changing. I am quite busy. I will prescribe you some medicine for this month. The pharmacist will explain how to take them. I need you to do 4 things for me. Listen carefully. First, take all your medicine. Second, stop eating all kinds of seafood. Third, go to bed before 9PM. Fourth, exercise 30 minutes a day. All of that? And do not scratch. I want a get-better-right-away pill. I'm kind of in a hurry. If you are in a rush, then exercise for 1 hour. There's no such pill. No, I mean only take some medicine and get better. Something that doesn't make me sleepy. Mister, your damn body is at war with you now. Shit doc said damn too. Wow she rocks! I'm sorry I said damn. Sorry. Well.. your body is trying to communicate that inside of you is not okay. I think it's actually threatening to kill me. Correct! All right. See you again next month. Ms. Toi, next case please. Take this and read it. Here is your next appointment. See you next month. I hope you get better. If I'm not free, can I reschedule? Hey c'mon, the date is set. Don't reschedule. I want to see you. Okay. Bye. Bye. Excuse me. So what's wrong with me? I don't know yet. I just know you have an allergy. An allergy? Bye. Stop staring, it makes me stressed. Almost finished. Normally you are not late. I'm not late yet. Almost. Je. Huh? I'm curious about something. Sup? Have you ever had a breast cancer exam? Yes, why? You have breast cancer? So you've got them checked? Yeah. Weren't you embarrassed? Why the hell are you asking? Just shut up and work. Your hands, keep them working. I want to know. So when you show your tits to a doctor, you aren't embarrassed? They see tons of tits, they don't care about mine. Even a guy doctor, you won't be embarrassed? Nope. Only when... I showed my boyfriend my tits the first time. Way too much information. Well, you asked. I asked about your doctor, not your tits. And why did you feel shy? Uh.. because I like him. Usually we feel shy around people we like, right? Why are you asking? Are you asking for someone? No, I'm just asking. For real? Yeah. Hey just tell me. What's going on? I just want to know. Is that so? Done! See I told you I wouldn't be late. Okay. This one? I'm taking it now? Okay. This is what they call late. How is it late? You are 3 minutes late. Not more that 5 minutes, it doesn't count. Usually you finish an hour ahead. Anything to eat? Here, I got in line for you. See how kind I am. It's your favorite. The rest you can send later. Okay. Let's go, Suchart. Shit! I'm conflicted. What about the shrimp dumpling you order everyday? I don't know either man. But I heard that if we're allergic to something, we must eat more of it and we'll get over that allergy. Like using snake venom to make snake serum, right? You never heard of that? No. Never. Fight fire with fire, man. You're full of shit. For real. Shit what to do! Kai, do you think we eat to live, or live to eat? Live to eat of course! Or else why bother living! Agreed. But if you say we eat to live, then I'll throw it away. You don't have any work to do or something? Huh? I'm very busy that's why I'm here asking you. So what will it be? Okay. Eat to live. Eat to live. Got it? Right? Eat to live. Shit. But it tastes so good. What should I do? You talk too much. How about this? Trade your dumplings for my foot-long cheese sausage? I'll give you two. Damn, why aren't we allergic to macrobiotic food? Damn everything yummy is bad for your health. But a life without yummy food is a very sad life. Freaking waste of time. I spent 10 mins talking about dumplings. I've made my decision. Rash: 23 spots Damn shrimp! Sent. I will see you at the meeting later. Okay. Why did you send it late? Beyotch, it's not late. Stop saying late. I don't like it. Take before bedtime. May make you sleepy. This one I'll have to skip, doc. I feel so guilty. What to do? Yes, Mister? I want to be a member. Monthly or lifetime? Lifetime. All done. Damn, just holding it makes me feel healthier already. I will be back. You aren't going to exercise today? Not yet. I have to go back to work. I see. Posting a pic of my new shoes makes me breathe easier. This is the starting point of a healthy lifestyle. New shoes...New life... What's up, Je? "New shoes... new life" Someone like you, jogging along in the morning sunlight? Why not? Even some rock stars play Ping Pong. So? A job is better than a sunburn, right? Oct 7, pick up the brief in the morning. Okay. Okay. This print job has 5 pictures. You've got 4 days. You know the way to Joe's place? Remember? You've been there. Je. What? What day? Oct 7. Appointment: Wed 7 Oct 2015. I can't make it. What? A second ago, you said okay. I've got another job. Sorry. October. Damn. Dark circles. She will know just by looking at me. Rash: 33 spots You're not helping me at all. I did what you told me. New shoes? Have you jogged in them yet? Judging by your rash. No, you haven't. No cream residue. You've been scratching, right? It's itchy, doc. So I have to scratch it, right? If I scratch, my itch will go away, right? Wrong! The more you scratch, the itchier you get. The more your lesions will get worse. And the bedtime pill, you didn't take either, right? If I didn't take them, you can tell? No. But based on what you just said. I know you didn't. And how is your penis? Doc, you don't miss a thing, do you? I'm really upset. What you ask is too hard. It's like asking me to become a monk. This... Who sleeps at 9PM anyways? In my profession, it's impossible. What I am asking you to do isn't hard. It is hard. Do you sleep at 9PM? Or you work 24 hours? Yes. No weekends off? Nope. Wait...not even on Sunday? Why take Sunday off? You need money that bad? It's not about money, doc. Let me explain. The freelance industry is very tough. Whatever work comes in, we have to take it. Or someone else will. And if I don't take the job, they won't hire me next month. My calendar will be empty. I'll be jobless. Hire someone to help? Get help. Then they will call and give it to that person instead. And the other thing is when they call they want me to do the job. So I should be the one doing it. Do you think your body will stop at just a rash? It's just getting started. F*ck you body. Don't scratch. Do you have a nickname? Yoon. Yoon. I'm Imm. We're around the same age, so let's be friends. When I'm treating someone, I take it very seriously. I think you also take things seriously too. So we should be able to understand each other. Because when I treat someone and that patient doesn't get better, it's like I'm doing a bad job. You know what I mean? You may wonder... why I ask you all kinds of personal questions that seem like none of my business, but... just trust me, I really do care. Think of this as a partnership. Nice working with you. Shit you're so screwed man. And if next time you aren't any better, I'm going to get you for real. See you next month. Bye. Hey no need to do that. We're friends now. Don't scratch. It's perfect already. Just check and send. You'll miss your bedtime. Huh? Damn her nail is broken. F*ck it's almost 9PM. You take long showers so you need spare time. Damn you also have to apply cream. Stop being paranoid. No one will notice it. This tiny. Enough. Done. Stop. Save. Send. Sleep. Just hit Command-s. Save. Sent it. Hey did you finish this too quickly? I'm that cool. Yeah yeah. Too late to fix. Sent it already. Turn off the computer. Turn off the computer. Turn off the computer. Turn off the computer. Turn off the computer. Damn it. You shook her hand once. Now you're all messed up inside. That's the bravest you've been in 7 years. The last time you were in bed before 9 was 7th grade. Lord Buddha Lord Buddha Lord Lord Hold on. I have another deadline on Wednesday, right? Damn it. 7 hours gone with the wind. I should have fixed the nail. Shit! I'm lying down but can't sleep. Her nail is still broken. Forget it. No one will see it. But if you can see it, someone else might too! How could you send such crappy work like that? Shit her nail is broken. If you try too hard to sleep, you can't sleep. If you want to fall asleep, don't try so hard. But her nail is broken. Just sleep! Actually we can stop thinking... Shit! But her nail is broken! Stop thinking of stop thinking already! Excuse me. The hell kind of machine? This heavy, who the hell can lift it? Damn! Hey do you need any help? I am coming for you. I'm gonna get you. You damn rash! Wait. Shit I forgot to turn on my cell phone. Je Damn it. 57 missed calls. Did a client die? What's up? Sup? Didn't you call me? Never mind. Never mind? Just tell me why you called? Nothing. The Girls Group's cover, I noticed a nail was broken. But I already got Jerd to fix it. So it's ok. Hey! You sent my work to Jerd. That really sucks. C'mon it was just a little job. Little? Any newbie can do it. It will make no difference. How can you say that, Je? No difference? It was a simple little job. Be reasonable. You turned off your mobile for half a day. What was I supposed to do? I had to fix it. You weren't here. Are you seeing someone now? The hell! Have you ever seen me with a girl? No. But if you do, that's cool. But turning off your cell phone. That's too much. Normally you're more professional than this, you know? It's good that I noticed it first. How could you miss that? Even I noticed it. "Normally you're more professional than this, you know?" Shit! It's not going away. Not better. So tired. A waste of time. What am I doing? Hold on. Shit! November. There are less spots, doc. Rash: 31 spots 1 or 2 spots doesn't count as better. But at least it's less. Thank you. Did you do exactly as I told you? Yes. Really? Yes. So what went wrong? Let me ask you more personal questions. I need to find out more. What's your favorite food? Shrimp dumplings from 7-Eleven. Your favorite food is from 7-Eleven? Nothing else to eat at night. And it tastes good. They also have rice balls. Are you joking? I'm not joking. They really have them. Then on your free days, what do you do? Whoa that's hard to answer. No, it isn't. How about movies, music, the mall, and the beach? Nothing? Everything you said is a waste of time. How is that entertaining? Go to the mall, to do what? To buy clothes? I don't buy any. You don't buy any clothes at all? I can still wear my old ones. If I go there, I got to shop around. I'm too lazy to choose. You can go out, just to hang out. It's fun. What do you mean, "go out just to hang out?" Go out just to hang out you know? I don't get it. What are you saying? Sometimes I think you are messing with me. I'm not messing with you. Why would I do that? What do you find entertaining? Hmm... Thinking of new projects. Hey that is work. No. Work is when someone hires us to do something. This is thinking of stuff to do on our own. Then how about sports? Sports? I like to play badminton but I have no one to play with. You don't meet up with your friends at all? I meet them sometimes at funerals and weddings. But I can't really invite anyone out, since my schedule always changes. Do you have a girlfriend? Dang! This has anything to do with my rash? Seriously. Some people think there is no link, but a patient's lifestyle has an effect on their disease. And if I don't, what is your medical opinion on having one or not? It actually depends on the person. Some people have one and it's good, but for some, it's bad. Like being so co-dependent you flunk your test. You are like a detective. I'm close to identifying the bad guy. You already know half my life story. Some of your questions even my mom has never asked. Are you saying I'm nosy? No. Why would I say that, doc? You should get more sleep, doc. How do you know I didn't? I am an expert on this. Just looking at your eyes, I can tell. Lately, I have exams. I recommend Redbull mixed with coffee. You can stay awake until dawn. And that's good? It's okay. It's not like we're 20 anymore. Back then, staying up 2 nights was nothing. But in our 30's, our body starts breaking down. How long can you stay awake? 5 days. Like the X-men. It's my special power. But I'm okay. I feel totally fine. I can do it, doc. It's... necessary. I think you should stop. This is my profession, how can I stop? If you can't stop, can you do less? I can't. But... I see other freelancers, they don't work this hard. For normal freelance people that is true. But I feel I can do more. So why do I... have to be like other normal people? I think your rash not going away has nothing to do with your job. Make sure you take the bedtime pill. I did. If you did, you'd be complaining about being sleepy. Shit! What do you think? See! It's okay. It's as good as if you did it. Actually, Jerd is like you 5-6 years ago. People are saying he is Yoon 2, you know? So why did you ask me to come? Wasting my time. Adidas Japan. I'll do it! Shit doc, I'm sorry. That was automatic. Good. You get to work on an international brand finally. I know you've been dying for this. You know how hard it was to land this? I need your best this time. What's up with you? Are you possessed? No, I was just thinking if I had anything else to do? If you do, make sure to clear your schedule. Make sure this is your first priority. If you do this well, there are more jobs coming. Doc, don't worry. I won't break my promise. Hey... You can't charge your laptop here. Sir, I really need to download some work. Just a little while? Yes. This medicine may make you sleepy. I'm taking it doc. Shit! Damn it! Only half an hour left. Are you done? Here. Thank you. Just half for now. Tomorrow morning I will send you the rest. You haven't finished it yet? This is a big project. Je, what are you doing? I'm calling Jerd. Why are you calling him? Tomorrow you will get it. Yoon. Je, don't call. Send it now or we're screwed. Je, stop dialing. You have another 50% to finish. It's not... Doesn't matter. I will finish it. But it isn't, see? I'm finishing it. Hello Jerd. This is Je speaking. Yes. Are you free now? I've got a job for you. It's for Adidas. You can, right? So you're free? Okay. Where are you now? Okay, I will send you the file. Bye. Yoon. Save the file for me now. No, I won't. Yoon. No. This isn't the time to be afraid of losing a job. Have you lost it man? I'm not afraid. You are not afraid, huh? What do you call this? I said I'll send the rest tomorrow morning. You have another half. You won't make it in time. You taught me that freelance work is all about being responsible. If you can't make it, don't take the job, remember? But I will finish in time. Is this in time? Yeah. Seriously you think you can. But it's impossible. You have another 50%. I've been waiting for this job. I don't want it to go to someone else. Do you want me to beg? Je, please just this one time. Tomorrow I will send the rest. When you talk like this, what do you expect? Let's go Suchart. This medicine may make you sleepy. Bring it on bedtime pill! I'm not afraid of you. Kai, let's play badminton. Huh? Badminton. What? Hurry. Alright. Don't hit it left and right like that. I'm tired. What's with all this technique! Gosh! I'm so beyond this bedtime pill. December. Number 190. Number 190. Number 190. Next number 191. Je, I sent it. I really hate you sometimes. You always have it your way. Okay thank you. I will send it in. You still have time to see me? I've been standing here for a while now. I feel like I'm making life hard for you. Seriously, why are you here? I'm trying very hard, doc. This is trying? Yes. It's spread to your ear now, you know that? Rash: 50 spots If on the outside it's like this, the inside is probably worse. I understand doc but... I've been dying to do this job. And it finally arrived. You want me to turn it down? Opportunities like this come once in a life time. But you only have one life, right? That's right. We got one life, so we should do what we want to do. And do the best we can. You look like you aren't afraid of dying. You just said that we only have one life, right? So we should find what makes us happy, right? And what I do makes me happy. I don't feel tired doing it. So I work hard and I'm wrong? And everyone has to die anyways, right? You're a doctor. You should know that. You obviously know little about dying. I might know more than you. That's why I'm not afraid. Hold up. I've met other people who talk like you. They don't have anyone in their lives to care about. Are you one of those people? I think your diagnosis has gone too far now. Being called out nosy is actually quite harsh. I didn't mean it like that. Okay. It's a doctor's duty to never turn a patient away. So I got to continue treating you. Sorry for wasting your time. You still have the medicine, right? Here. Next time if you want to change doctors, you can. Just inform them at the counter. Never felt lonely. Because I have me, myself to care. Damn, so music video of you. Up yours. What's wrong? Are you sick? No. You sure? You want to see a doctor? Damn. To say sorry I have to wait another month. Yoon. Yoon. Yoon. Yoon. Yoon, he said the crack doesn't look good. It looks retouched. The photo is unrealistic. Okay. One more thing I am sorry to bring this up, but you forgot to erase the finger of the guy who's lifting the athlete's leg. Shit! Don't try to make any excuses. Shitty work is shitty work. Shitty work because you suck! No excuses will do. Yoon. Yoon. Are you listening? Yeah. About Adidas. The 2nd lot. The set with the girl, they want to take a break. Who's doing it then? Nobody. It's just a break. Just a break? No such thing. Who is doing it, Je? Jerd. Hello Peng. Hey, I heard you lost it? You heard about that? Even though I'm in another office, when Je got chewed out, I knew about that. Accidents happen sometimes. But some people who are hit by car once are handicapped for the rest of their lives. Working freelance, you must always do good work. Or be jobless before you know it. I know I suck. C'mon. Think on the bright side. At least during New Year this time you can relax at home like everyone else. It will be a new experience for you. Anyway, I got to go. I got a briefing. Bye. Happy holidays. You ready to be happy for once? From today lots of people start traveling home. And plan to travel around here and abroad. Only the first day, I'm already going insane. Damn I'd die for a job now. Your mail sir. Happy New Year son. Stay healthy, and take good care of yourself. Mom. PS. The photo I asked you to retouch, when will I get it? It's not that kind of work, mom. Shoot Je! Shoot what? Umm... What's up? I'm off to Japan. You want anything? You? To Japan? To do what? My boyfriend surprised me. Going to countdown to the New Year there. Counting down at Central World would be the same? Just as boring. You want to say that to my boyfriend? You're leaving now? Yeah, boarding soon. So you want anything? I don't know. No. Just go. Have fun. Alright. Happy New Year in advance. Happy New Year. Je. Jerd Pantagan "Working over New Year's Eve is the highlight of my life". #Haven't slept for 5 days. Damn! How the hell did I get to this point? The point where my whole calendar is blank. Oh wait, maybe I won't be free. Doctor's appointment. Excuse me. Do you have anything that is scientific, yet artsy. What do you want it for? I'm buying it as a New Year's gift. Royally inscribed stone monolith, 4,200THB. Sir Isaac Newton head, 2,900THB. Let me browse around first. Okay. This highlight needle pen has the perfect mix of science and art. First, place the box in the center of the paper. This activity is so 6th grade. But it's actually kind of fun. January. Number 133. Sawasdee Pee Mai (Happy New Year in Thai) Happy New... Sawasdee Pee Mai is better. Hello doc, Sawasdee Pee Mai. Umm doc, last month I'm... Number 134. Sorry... Damn your hands are freaking cold. Just like when you rode that roller coaster, right before it flipped upside down. I'm Assanai. Am I in the wrong room? No, you are not. Doctor Chonnikarn is doing rounds in the ward. Today let me check on your progress. That's okay. I can come back next month. Why? So I can be examined by Doctor Imm. She's handling my case. I'm following her treatment plan. She wrote down all your history. So your treatment plan is the same. C'mon. I studied the same specialty as Doctor Imm. I won't kill you. Let me see your arm. Here. It's a sore. How long has she been treating you? Half a year. Wow that's a long time. Doctor Imm's patients never get better. Stop bitching you chink. Chinky, stop chatting in Line. Focus on me a little? Here for you. Doctor Imm. Tell him if he has to stay awake, do not stay awake for more than 1 day. Take the bedtime pills. And get some rest. I feel the chemistry inside my body is changing. But I don't know what it is. Oh! Tell him, do not scratch. Doc....I.... Hey, you're just supposed to read it. Can I please just reply her? Doc. I am sorry about last month. Read. Can I just read her reply? Happy New Year. Get some rest. Turn off your computer and go to the beach. See the sunrise or something. Same to you... That's enough. This is not an internet cafe. Bye...computer. I must get some rest and relax. Doctor's orders. No turning back. Are these all the patterns you have? Whatever the pattern, they all float the same. But they aren't pretty. Fun. Yoon! Hella entertaining. What's next, doc? I didn't bring a computer with me. I'm sorry. The next time you call, I'll definitely do it for you. Please give me a call. Okay. How do people just lie around and do nothing? Doing nothing is totally useless. Dear Goddess Tubtim, even though I'm picky about my jobs lately, I still want some jobs to come in. Holy shit! I didn't even finish yet. Je give it to me. Hello Yoon, please come in to get the brief. Sure! The photo looks too cheap. Wedding photos are supposed to look more fancy, right? I want more classic, and hi class. I'm not doing it. Say what? You get back from the beach and you're indie now? Why now? I got knocked up. So my man proposed to me. No. Why did you have to quit too? I'm pregnant. He doesn't want me to work. You can still work even if you're pregnant. If I was pregnant, I would still work. You don't understand. I am having a baby, and it will affect the baby. If you play that card, there's nothing more to say. Why are you upset? I'm not upset. You told me we would work side by side forever. Yeah I did say that. I'm sorry. But you understand right? I don't. You can't do this to me. Are you really mad? You have no right to be mad! Why can't I? No. Listen and stop worrying. Your jobs won't disappear. I'll find a new person to take my place, okay? Why so mad? Because nobody can replace you. You can find someone better. But I don't want it. It's not you. For me, there is no Je 2. I'm sorry. No need to be sorry. It's my fault. I knew this day would come. I thought I'd be okay. But in reality, I can't take it. I am sorry too. I am so sorry. I didn't mean to leave you hanging. But there comes a time when we have to choose, right? And I just didn't choose work like you did. Can I ask you to do one thing for me? Even if there's no work, call me sometime. I'll call for sure. As soon as I give birth, you'll be the first person I call. Oh shit. I can't. I have to call my dad. Then I will call you 2nd. You go do whatever you want to do then. That photo I have lots of pimples. Erase them for me. No hurry. Your deadline is 2 days. Beyotch. Make my boobs a little bigger too. - Is this man the best you can do? - When did I have time? I'm always with you. Surprise proposal clip of Je and Shane. Wait. You have moment like this too, Je? How the hell is this a surprise? This is the most cliche thing in the world. Je. We've been together for many years. If you're so happy, you cry. Tomorrow I'll kick you in the head. Will you marry me? Alright. I'm sorry, I didn't cry. It's okay. Hold on. I'm crying. Shit! What the hell! February. How could you make the wrong diagnosis, doctor!? This is a person's life, not some pig, dog, or chicken! You shouldn't be a doctor! Go do something else! Please calm down, sir. Calm down please. Doc. Here a New Year's present for you. Last time you didn't come. So I'm giving it to you now. Thank you. Let's have a look. Rash: 24 spots Better. See you again next month. Any medicine left just tell the pharmacist. Doc, I have something to tell... Doctor. Are you alright? I suck. I've been treating that man's nephew for so long. But he hasn't gotten better. In the end, I made the wrong diagnosis. Talk about bad luck, having me as your doctor. Maybe you should've gotten better sooner too. No one wants to waste time seeing a doctor, right? I am sorry. I.... I know I am not that good, but I try. I'm trying my best. Shit think of something to say to make her feel better. What should I say? And what the hell is wrong with me? Standing, eating this junk food with nitrates. As a kid I ate so much of this I went to the hospital. But if eating it makes you feel better, then it's okay. It's not standard medical practice but.. the better you feel the faster you heal. Shit, it rhymes. Sounds sweet like a poem. Am I seeing a doctor? Actually I just realized that being a doctor is tough. You have to say things that make patients feel better. I feel I've been a bad patient all this time. Feeling better? Yeah. Thank you so much. You aren't busy today? I'm not wasting your time, am I? I lost my job. I screwed up and word got out to the whole industry. No one wants to hire me. So I'm free everyday. I should say that's great, right? So you can rest. Okay? No more black circles around your eyes. I retouched under my eyes for you. I will erase the rash for you too doc. Actually our occupations have a lot in common. I don't know if you still want to die. But you are not allowed to, got it? You must get better. Okay? "The way you look at someone says more than words. And feelings sometimes cannot be explained." Shit! How did he come up with that? So warm and romantic. My work at the center of Shibuya #IloveAdidas #MomIdidit Jerd you make Thai people proud. Wow you've come a long way my friend. Congratulations bro. It looks like a funeral in black and white. My boyfriend wants it more dreamy. What do you mean dreamy? You know dreamy. The fact you took these at the park is lame. Don't tell me you want pink grass too. Just do it to make him happy. For real? Yup. Do you want jumping rabbits in the background? Okay if the client wants it, I'll do it. Being in relationship isn't a waste of time, really? It is. But I made my choice. Actually it's quite fun. I've learned new things. Learned what? Not telling. I don't want to spoil anything. Holding back on me now. I've learned how to love. How was that for a sweet answer? But don't you argue? It's a lot of hard work. Surprisingly it feels good. Weird huh? So did you hit it yet? Hell there's nothing to hit! Rash: 0 Shit! They're all gone! Shit. They're all gone. So I don't have to go see the doctor anymore? March. I thought you weren't coming. Why are you late today? Well I couldn't sleep last night. Oh! So you didn't take the bedtime pills? I did. But I still couldn't sleep. That's odd. So how are you today? Feeling better? Let's have a look. C'mon. This side. They're all dry. Let me check your neck. Wow they are all gone. Lift up your t-shirt. So there aren't anywhere else, right? All gone. So you are cured. Yes, I am. Why you sound like you knew it already? Oh that's why you didn't wear a jacket. You know if you're all better, you didn't have to come. Done. Congrats. So next month we won't see each other anymore. It's all good, doc. Thanks a lot. Hey... You are okay. It's all good. You understand. It's all good. Before you went you knew this would happen, right? So what's wrong with you now? Anyway, you're not going to see her anymore. Why do I feel like heartbroken, just like my 2nd year in college? But this time how can it be a broken-heart? It can't be. A relationship like this where... we meet for a few minutes a month, the doctor is just doing her job. There's nothing more to it. So how can I say that I'm heartbroken? But just now I said heartbroken 3 times. Shit. There is no way I'm heartbroken. You're way brokenhearted bro. It's not hard to tell. I've given you my diagnosis. No way. Why not? Sure. You have all the symptoms. You can't eat, or sleep. I know. I was a teenager once. But we didn't even pass go. But from what you've told me, you've gone far enough. Why did you drop all your work to go see her? You even asked me to play badminton to exercise. Right? I was sick. So I went to see a doctor. I exercised to get better. You did it so she would give you props. You did it for her. You wanted her to see you doing good things. You'll be ok because you want to be ok for her, right? Gosh bro, this isn't hard to understand! Love is like a disease. You can treat it. I will prescribe you some medicine. Here, shrimp dumplings. Just eat this yummy stuff you like. It will help. One more thing, you have to find something to do. So you won't be free to think too much. Working is good. Way back when I was like you broken-hearted. I almost flunked out of college. I kept working. Then forgot everything, even being broken-hearted. Stop being sad, no time for that. Just worked. It works! Songkran I am free. A 2-day deadline that's doable. Yes. Yes, sir. Hi everybody. I am back! Rash: 1 spot I've got my life back. Hello. Hello. This is Peng. Are you free? I have a job for you. I'm free. That's what I like about you. Driven. So let's meet up tonight. 9PM. Alright. I am really in a hurry. See you bro. Okay. This work is from my friend, Lisa. She's having a gallery exhibition in New York. Extremely urgent. And this is part of her exhibition. It's installation art. And it needs some retouching. Everything needs to be done quickly. It's so urgent that I thought of you first. On this planet, no one but you could finish it in time. Day 1 You have 2 weeks. But you must send an update every day. And Lisa will give you her feedback right the way. No problem. Kai. But this job, you must do solo. Because she is very paranoid about her work leaking. If you can do this job, the Shibuya job Jerd did will pale in comparison. When you're done, let's go to New York together. Day 2 Yes, Peng? I sent you the feedback for the previous lot already. Is this lot done? Not yet. Why are you so slow? You must work faster than this. Okay. Day 3 Isn't this going overboard, bro? Your body might fall apart. It's okay. I've been up for 5 days before. Kai. I'm really thankful that you told me to work. It really works. Shit. My head is so heavy. Day 4 Yoon. You accepted the job from Peng? Yeah. You know the scale of that job is 2 months of work. You've only got 2 weeks. And you accepted it! Yeah. You know even though I... I didn't screen it, you should have known better. Why did you take it? Peng always takes advantage of people. You're the only one who looks up to him. You know when he said that you're the first person he thought of. He lied! You know that? At least someone thinks of me, Je. Thought of you, that's f*cked up. He only cares about his job. So he sweet talked you into taking this job. - Je, I'm happy. - He asked you to do the work alone. - I am okay, got it? - You know how small our industry is? Are you... Day 6 Shit day 6 I've broken my record. Day 8 Day 9 Hello. Why didn't you pick up my calls? Done? We're out of time. Yes. Yes what? You need to hurry. You're falling behind you know that? Yes. Day 12 I've heard that people can stay up for 11 days. This is day 12. I've broken the world record. Where no one has gone before. This means more than a Cannes Lion award. We're born once, so we got to give it our all like this. I think... I've reached the apex of work now. If Peng could see me now, he would know I gave it my all. My chest hurts. It hurts badly. Body. You're so unreasonable. Let me do my work first? Only 2 photos left and I'm done. Shit. I can't breathe. Hey body. You really mean to get back at me now, right? Bring it on. I'm not afraid. Death is a natural thing for me. I used to think we should all design our own funerals. I want my funeral... to not be at a temple. It can be in this room. Just a nice coffin and flowers. I like TK a lot. Never seen them live. I would want them to sing at my funeral. I want them to sing the song 'Handkerchief'. It's a hit song so everyone can sing along. Guest list. Je Kai Pongsatorn Mom 4 people. That's it. Not many. I'm not sure whether I want the doctor to come or not. I am sorry, doc. I...I died. I broke my promise. But please don't be sad. It isn't your fault. Hey everyone at my funeral, you don't have to be sad. Death is natural. Just...feel a little bad. I won't get to see Je's baby's face. Kai I won't get to play badminton with you anymore. It was really fun that night. Shit! In the end, I forgot to retouch the photo for mom. Doc I didn't get to tell you about the beach. Actually, I wanted to say sorry about the other day. And... I wanted to talk to you again, even as just a friend. Shit! Actually I'm missing out on a lot. So the doctor told you not to die. Body. I am sorry. I surrender. But you won't forgive me, right? Goodbye everyone. Is this the last thing I see in this life? It isn't even beautiful. Hello Peng. Hey you. Don't call me a douchebag. But your job isn't finished. Just a little more. I asked Lisa to send one day late. If you get up now, you will finish it in time. You can work here. I brought your computer. There's WiFi too. This is why I told you not to call me a douchebag. But this is about finishing work and being responsible. Just a little bit more. Only 2 photos. If you finish this job, you can rest as many days as you want. And when you're done, we'll go to NYC together. Ok? So what did you say to him? I told him I want to sleep. Damn. Was Peng angry? He wasn't. Just told me to fuck off and change careers. Don't worry. I will find you some jobs. Will you do one thing for me? Don't do anything stupid like this again. I'm asking you as your best friend. Alright. Je. You have to have a baby. What? I came back from the dead just to see your kid's face. So you are free today? Yeah. I came to take care of you. I have so much to do. Number 116. Mr. Assanai why are you back? I thought you got better. I miss you. So I thought I'd visit. Yeah? Room 5 please. Number 117. That day if I thought of you only as a patient, I wouldn't have felt anything. But being that we're friends, I felt sad. So I hoped that you're feeling well. And I wouldn't have to see you again. I'm feeling well, doc. I just wanted to see you again. There is one thing I wanted to tell you. But I didn't get to tell you. When you told me to go to the beach, I really went there. I never thought I'd want to sit and watch the sunset. But you told me to. So I watched it that day. Honestly, seeing the sunset was a waste of time, but that day I don't know why, I... I sat there for hours. That day I felt like I could breathe easily. And I was happy. Just like every time I see you. Thank you very much, doctor. I thought you said you were feeling well. I hope next month we won't see each other again.
