THE QUIET DUEL Doctor. Doctor. Doctor. Are you alright? How many more? Many more. Patients keep coming. Pretty bad. - Miguel. - Yes. - Fan. - Yes. - Pulse? - A bit fast. Do something. Take it off for me. Are you alright? Bring some Iodine. He is getting weak. - Camphor. - Yes. I want to see my wife. I haven't seen her for three years. There are lots of women everywhere. My wife is to die for. You know, I don't want to have any weird disease here. But because of a disease you might be able to go home. You... - Private Nakata. - Yes? Do you have syphilis? Do you? - Do you have it?! - Yes. - Horiguchi! - Yes? - Yes? - Ah. - About the soldier, Nakata... - Yes? - Do a blood test on him. - Okay. His cut doesn't close yet. He seems to have a spirochete. I can only test for the blood reaction here. - Yeah. - Alright. Do my blood test in a few days. What? Your blood test, Doctor? This cut was soaking in his blood for an hour. Horiguchi! - Horiguchi! - Yes! Haven't you received the result of the blood tests yet? No. It's been more than two weeks since I sent my blood. What did you receive from the head office today? Yes... Why can't you say? Since you are hiding it, I know the result. I tested positive, right? - Doctor! - I know. Yes... We don't have Salvarsan here, do we? I think we have a bit. Antiphlogistic? - You can go now. - Yes. SURGERY OBSTETRICIAN AND GYNECOLOGIST Hey. - Where is the doctor? - He is here. I am terribly sick today. Are you playing sick again? Poor people should die early for their own good. Are you still mad I stopped you from killing yourself? As the doctor said, can't you start your new life as a nurse? What about the baby? - What can I do with this tummy? - I'll tell you... - you'll be glad to have the baby. - How does a man know it?! You can't give birth to a baby. The doctor here is the same. If he wants to help me, he should get rid of the baby. He's at the operating room. - Will it be long? - I think so. - It's an "appe." - Okay. - What's an "appe"? - Appendicitis. "Appe." "Appe." You start to sound like a nurse now. By the way, she is the wife-to-be of the young doctor here, right? She was his fianc?. - "Was"? - Ms. Imai told me so. He made her wait for six years. Now he doesn't want to get married. All men are like that. Don't be ridiculous! The doctor here is a fine man. He is weird! Ms. Imai was complaining... that this hospital used to be clean. Miss Minegishi! Miss Minegishi, help us! I'm okay. No need to worry. Don't feed him for 24 hours. Not even water. - Can I take him back home? - That's impossible. - At least one week... - You'll bankrupt me, idiot! I can't pay 300 or 400 yen a day... Dad, I'll cure it at home. Could you buy me a glove, though? Doctor, can I go home? What's your batting position? - Third. - Alright. Sleep well and dream of home runs. If you get worse, you can't play baseball. Alright? Don't worry about the money. We have extra rooms. Hey, you look happy. Hi. I didn't know you were coming today. Wow, what beautiful flowers. Thanks to you, this shed finally looks like somebody lives here. What were you looking at? We were all young then. Your house was very dirty. What a rascal Kyoji looks here. Can a war change a person so much? Miss Misao, about Kyoji... Somehow... I don't know what he is thinking these days. I am really sorry. After making you wait for six years... he started to say he didn't want to get married for a while. I don't know what to say to you and your parents... Sir, please don't worry about that. I don't care about it... I don't know what to say... I don't know why... but I feel like the time I spent with Kyoji was an old fairy tale. A fairy tale? I am not a child any more. I'll be fine. I can... take care of myself... - Kyoji, take her home. - Ah. - But I still have a patient. - I'll do it. Take her home. My father is getting very weak these days. My father seemed to have given up our marriage... a long time ago. He started to say he'll look for a man for me. Then, is there a man for you? - What do you think? - If there is... Should I marry him if I like? What if I say I'll wait for you until I can marry you? I think I told you my thoughts about it... But you haven't told me why you can't marry me. I'm scared to hear it. But I'm prepared to hear even a terrible thing. Please tell me. Please. Suppose... there is a man. This is just an assumption. It can be a man or a woman. The person... The body of the person... is pure, but not pure. It's dirty. Have you ever imagined those kinds of conditions? Miss Minegishi! Miss Minegishi! What? It's weird. A box of Salvarsan is gone again. - Do you know about it? - Salvarsan? It's an injection for syphilis. What?! What made you think I know about the medicine? Are you accusing me of something? I haven't fallen that much. If I do things that can give me syphilis, why I am so poor? You said the body is pure, but not pure. I know you don't have such a genetic disease. Why can't you tell me the truth, that you don't love me anymore? I don't go to your place anymore. Please give my best to your father. You... You can rest now. You are working hard. You must be tired. I used to get that shot all the time. It's vitamins, right? "Salvarsan." - Good morning. - Good morning. Did you dream about a home run? No. I only dreamed about clean water running. Can I drink water? It's been 24 hours. Okay. But just a little bit. - Tea is good. - Okay. See! I told you it's been 24 hours already. Mother, you aren't flexible at all. Doctor, there is a flea in my plaster cast. - Everybody says that. - It itches so much. - Can I give him this much? - Sure. It's special. Go ahead. What? That's it? Doctor, when can I eat? Huh? After you pass gas. After an appendectomy, you'll be fine if you pass gas. - Gas is the best. - What's "gas?" - Farts. - What? That's it? I came here again somehow. My legs were moving toward your place without knowing. Kyoji, you are unhappy, aren't you? Why? Please tell me why. Why? You're suffering from something. Why? Why have you changed so much? - I just got old. That's all. - That's a lie! Sometimes you seem like you're from... a different world, somewhere far. Oops. Did I interrupt you? Are you studying for the test? What? What test are you talking about? A test for nurses. It's not fun being a probationary nurse. That test? Sure, I'm studying for it. But, I'm not sure a one-time dancer like me... can do such a sacred job. Even a reliable person like Ms. Imai... says she'll quit soon. I asked Ms. Imai to stay, but... I can't force anything on anybody. A nurse's job is tough. The world isn't that easy a place... as a young lady thinks it is. Right. It may not be. I don't care if you speak ill of me, but... Oh, did I speak ill of you? No, you didn't speak ill of me. What I meant is... You can criticize me... but I think you should appreciate what Kyoji did for you. Of course I do. I got pregnant... I couldn't eat... I was abandoned by a man. Then I tried to kill myself and he saved me. He even offered me to stay here. But if I had money at that time... I would've gotten rid of the baby... and lived happily ever after. If you didn't want to have a baby, why weren't you more careful? The father is an asshole who took a dancer to a hotel... and can't take responsibilities for his own baby... You should ask him for a certain responsibility. - That's troublesome! - You're a monster! - Miss, are you running away? - Miss Minegishi! The baby you have already has eyes and a nose. You're such a humanitarian. You're good at pretending. But then, why are you injecting Salvarsan?! Life is funny, isn't it? There are wheels within wheels. I was surprised. I thought there was no one in the examining room... and turned off the light. They moved suddenly. The doctors are still working. They were talking about something serious. Their financial condition must be pretty bad. You are an innocent girl. The father and the son may be secretly doing something bad. - No way. - Then... do you know who's been stealing Salvarsan? That's why you are so innocent. - Where are you going? - I'll eavesdrop on them. When people speak secretly, you can sometimes hear the truth. I... will beat up... the hypocrite! He called me a monster! He is the monster! I shouldn't have asked. I wanted you to tell me that Minegishi was wrong. I didn't want to believe you've been injecting Salvarsan. I can't believe... my son has... How bad is it? Wassermann reaction is 3 plus. Kyoji! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? I can't forgive you! I can't! I can't forgive you for Misao. - Father, I was... - I don't want to hear your excuse. I cut my finger while operating. And I received this spirochete from the patient. When I realized the patient had a horrible disease... I... thought of the worst disease. And... I was right. Kyoji, I'm ashamed. I imagined a foolish thing. - That's okay. - No. Even if I'm your father, I have to apologize to you when I have to. Please forgive me. But, Kyoji... why didn't you tell me earlier? I don't understand the politics of the country. Now I know why you are refusing Misao. I know why you are helping unfortunate people, too. I have experience, too... but misfortune makes people stubborn. I'm talking about Misao, too. You don't have to be so meticulous to her. I know. But... it might take three or five years to heal it. I was sent to many places during the war. Without medicine, my disease worsened. How old is Misao? - Twenty seven. - Right. But, Kyoji... I think... you should tell Misao everything. So that Misao can forget about you. I can't tell her that. I thought of it a lot. - But I can't tell her. - Why? If I tell her everything... I know she'll say she'll wait for me for five or ten years until I heal. I can't do that to her. I know Misao will wait. - She is such a woman. - Then, Kyoji... I don't have the courage to take away her life like that! Mr. Kondo! Mr. Kondo! Please be quiet. It's after 11:00. It came out! What? What came out? The kid's gas! Quiet now or the doctor will be mad at you. How was it? What did they talk about? Do you want some? Yesterday... your father came to my house. He came to decline our engagement formally. I asked him the reason many times... but I couldn't understand why you are breaking off the engagement. Half of my heart gave up. But the other half of my heart... doesn't give up and wants to know the reason desperately. I've been thinking... I've been depending on you too much. You knew our house needed a woman's hand. So you came here every day to help out. I asked you not to come anymore. But I was still depending on you. I'm selfish, but please don't come here anymore. I'll come here tomorrow, the next day... every day. What do you want for dinner tonight? Come in. The appendicitis kid wants to say goodbye to you. Okay. Miss. I decided to take the nurse test. Really? Kyoji will be happy to hear that. I'll give birth to the baby, too. What a change. - Miss. - What? I have a favor to ask. I think... the doctor is great. Could you tell him that I said that? I realized that I misunderstood him. I know I should apologize to him myself. But it's kind of late. But I at least told you that. I feel good now. Hey. Are you studying? I can't be a probationary nurse forever. You have changed. How's your baby? He's sleeping in the nurses' room. He is cute, isn't he? Kids are troublesome. That's all. You still have a sharp tongue. - You came here for treatment? - Not today. I want the doctor to come to my office. I have an injured guy. It's a terrible story. My colleague was inspecting cars... and suddenly a passenger attacked him. He is quite a gentleman, though. - He is a mad dog. - That's right. He suddenly raised his stick and... Ouch! I think I'd better examine his head, then. How's he doing? He's investigating now. - Come to see me when you can. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thanks. - Address. - 1-11 Atano-cho, Minato-ku. - Name? - Susumu Nakata. Oh, hi. Thank you very much for coming. How is he? He is fine. The injury will be cured in one week. - Can I come in? - Yes. Come in. Did you just say you are Nakata? Hey! It's you! Thanks for taking care of me at that time. - How is it? - Good. My wound adhered now. Did you go to a doctor about the disease? I went to see the doctor many times. - But I'm healed now. - The doctor said so? I can't go through everything the doctor said. But a spirochete is a very dangerous bacteria. Yeah. But there is nothing else I can do. - Did your baby fall asleep? - Yes. The great doctor was holding him. I feel sorry for him. He could've held his own grandchild by now. - Shall I give you an injection? - Yes, please. How's the result of the blood test? It was 2 plus. How long do you have to inject this medicine? I inject it for three months and rest for a month. I need to continue doing that. - Until the medicine is gone. - Then... how long does it take to heal completely? Well, I aggravated the disease. So I don't know how long. I hate him! The guy who gave you this disease... Is he alive? I heard it. - From my father? - No. I heard it when I was still pregnant. You and your father were talking about it here at night. At that time, this place was more lively. Don't you think? Ms. Imai is gone. Miss Misao hasn't showed up since. I heard she is getting married. Doctor! Don't you blame the guy?! I'm talking about the guy who gave you the disease! I would curse him to death! What a pest you are! I'm not your patient anymore. I think it is my duty as a doctor to warn you. I told you my disease is cured. That's what you think. That's unreliable. Is the fluid of the spinal cord minus now? I don't think about anything unpleasant. But you have to think about other people's happiness... rather than your own. What does that mean?! Four years ago, on the day you were sent back home... I told you that... - a spirochete... - Infects even by saliva. Right? But my wife is totally fine. - Your wife?! - That's right. Our child is growing fine in her tummy now. In half a year... I'll visit you with my healthy baby. See? Surprised, aren't you? I am surprised... by your reckless act. I don't want to tell you this. But I'll tell you because I want you to be serious about it. I got your spirochete in my body. When I operated on you at the field hospital... I got it from this cut. No way! Just listen. It's not a lie. Mr. Nakata, my disease isn't cured yet. And I'm still undergoing the treatment. Damn you! It's none of your business! Come to my hospital tomorrow with your wife! I'm not coming! My father is a gynecologist. He will try anything he can to save your baby. - Is the examination over? - Yes. What did he said? He wants to talk to you. It's a hard job. Is that for the baby of a patient? No. It's for my baby. Really? When did you have him? Just 50 days ago. You're counting the days since he was born. - What? - Well... Because you answered me quickly. Yeah. Without knowing it. I mark the calendar, so I count days without knowing it. You're having a baby, aren't you? Hey! You asked me to come here to humiliate me?! That's ridiculous. That's why I didn't tell your wife anything. I'm sorry if we offend you. But, as doctors, we have to tell you everything. If the mother is in serious condition, I have to consider the worst. What?! What does it mean? Are you saying my child will be retarded?! That might happen. If the baby gets early treatment, he'll be fine. But if it's too late, the baby will be premature or stillborn. There are many more gynecologists out there. Father, please let me talk to him. Mr. Nakata, let's talk about it calmly. We have to think how we can save your baby. You are calm because it's not about you. But this is my first baby! That's why... That's why I warned you not to do such a thing. "Get treatment when you get back home." "Don't spread your disease." "If you do, you'll ruin people's lives." This is nobody's fault, but yours. Please let me join your conversation. Were you listening to our conversation? Yes. Sit down. Mrs. Nakata. I just wanted to tell Mr. Nakata what I think. I thought it better for the two of you to talk quietly alone. Akiko, it's already happened. Alright? I'll be careful from now on. You're talking like it's about someone else. Men always talk like this. But we think a lot. Right, Dr. Fujisaki? I won't ask you to apologize to me deeply. Because that won't change anything. Mrs. Nakata. Can we talk about it calmly? I'm single. So I don't know what a husband and a wife is like. But if you guys talk calmly about it... you might be able to come to a good solution. Maybe you are right. Anyway, let's go home now. You haven't come here in a long time. The wedding day was fixed, so... Are you getting married? My father is pretty weak now. Women are no good in those situations. I think you are stronger than most women. I thought so, too. But... - Is Kyoji here? - Yes. Hi! Long time no see. It's good to see you. I've been busy since the wedding date was set. - How are your dinners? - Don't worry. Miss Minegishi has been taking care of everything. She is not good at cooking, though. I was worried. Even when I was busy, I was worried about it every evening. And I thought of the kitchen here. Do you want some tea? Sure. I'll be a guest today. Just like when I came here for the first time. Excuse me. What are you thinking about? - Nothing. - Don't make me worry. Please, sit down. You're a guest. If you love someone else... and because of that we have to say goodbye today... I can give you up easier. That must be true, considering your personality. Here. I haven't understood the reason yet. I don't want to say goodbye, but... I'm sorry... When is the wedding? Tomorrow. Tomorrow. That's very sudden. They decided it suddenly. - You'll be happy. - Thank you. Thanks for everything. At what time is the wedding? The wedding is at 2:00. We're leaving for our honeymoon at 5:00. The train will be crowded. That's what I heard. Kyoji... Promise you won't laugh. What is it? I want you to change your mind. And I want you to take me somewhere... leaving your job and everything. I... am going home. I don't have much time today. I'm sorry I can't cook dinner for you. I'll leave them here. Please be happy. I can't wish you that enough. Maybe I'll be happy. But I'm not sure how you'll do. You better go home. Yes. How's your father? He is playing with Miss Minegishi's baby. Should I go and say goodbye to him? You'd better not. My father isn't good at goodbyes. Please give my best to him. Good bye, then. I won't take you home. I don't want you to take me home, either. - Do you want your injection? - Yeah. Is it about Miss Misao? She was a great lady. Ms. Imai used to say to me... she didn't understand why you didn't act like other men. She said that even if you weren't getting married to her... it was impossible to control your desire forever. Imai is a realistic person. Tell me, doctor... is it easy for men... to control physical desire? Why do you ask? Because you are really calm. There are two kinds of patients, right? Some scream in pain. Others put up with pain dripping with sweat. Then you are the dripping with sweat type? Because I don't like losing... and I am a doctor. But doctors are human, too. Right? Right. Today I found out she will be the wife of some other guy. I thought I could give up everything. I can't! Now... I am fighting with my own desire. If I think back... my desire is such a poor thing. Before the war... I restrained the desire to pretend to be a decent man. During the war, I kept telling myself... that a peaceful marriage was waiting for me. Misao was waiting for me. So I controlled my desire. But one day... because of the blood of a shameless guy... my body became dirty without knowing any pleasure. I sometimes think... if I knew it would happen to me, I would've done things differently! If I'm being too honest, my physical desire will never be granted. Why do I have to suffer so much?! I'm a syphilis patient. But that's not my fault. My desire has nothing to do with it, either. My desire doesn't know anything yet. It's still pure. It sometimes screams. But... I have this conscience... I have this moral conscience... trying to kill all of my desire. My conscience is killing my desire! I want to destroy this conscience and live as my desire wishes. That's honest as a human, right? I'm just a fool pretending that I don't have a desire. I'm just sentimental now. Misao is a woman with a future. She has a body with a future. I've been longing to have that body for six years! Why do I have to see quietly as she becomes someone else's! It's not too late. I can still get Misao. Right, Miss Minegishi? I'm right, aren't I, Miss Minegishi? I'm sorry I told you embarrassing things. I'm a doctor. I have to live... with a doctor's conscience and a man's conscience. It's very hard. But, Doctor... if somebody wants to satisfy your desire... If somebody put herself in that position... what would you do? If there was a woman who didn't care about your disease. What does it mean? I decided not to have a husband at all. I'm thinking of putting myself in that position. Are you trying to be a hypocrite? Don't say such a thing. I think I love you. A hospital is a funny place. I wonder why I can't say anything in a businesslike manner. Where is the record of the man who had the operation? He has a high fever. I'll check on him. Get ready. I need disinfectant. I received a postcard from Misao. Really? Does she sound happy? Yeah. It says Hakone in snow is very beautiful. Well, Miss Misao doesn't like to lose, either. She can always find her happiness by herself. Dripping with sweat, right? I didn't know you were here. - The doctor? - He is here. Please come in. I didn't hear you come in here. Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Kyoji! Kyoji! - Help me operate. - Is she that bad? - Yeah. - But if it's an abortion... It's not an abortion. The fetus is dead already. Ma'am, what is wrong with you? I want to ride this car, too. You can't play with it now. Boy? Hey, kid! Doctor? Mrs. Nakata, do you want to wait for your husband to come? I left him and don't mean to go back to Nakata. - But... - Doctor? Is Nakata... causing you trouble or something? What kind? Did he do something to you during the war? He said you were making up the story about his disease. But lately I started to believe... the opposite of whatever Nakata says. We are a foolish couple. - Kyoji, we'd better hurry. - Yes. Everything is done. What happened to my baby? I knew it. Can I see the baby? Just once? No, you can't! But I... I don't think you should see the baby. Hey! Fujisaki! Hey! Please give me a hand! Are you drunk? What's wrong with being drunk?! Hey! Fujisaki! Please be quiet. This is a hospital. Hey, Fujisaki! Hey! Fujisaki! Fujisaki! Hey! You! How could you destroy my family?! Because of you, my family is messed up. - Because you told her that. - I... Shut up! The world is not what you think it is! A cold man like you never gets the hardship of humans! - You don't understand it! - What?! While you were drinking, your wife... went through a lot! What?! I heard you say you would operate on my wife! You'll be sorry if you do that! Where is Akiko?! I can't let you see her like this! Shut up! I'll see my wife! Your wife needs to rest! - As a doctor... - Shut up! Why are you giving me a hard time?! - You're giving me a hard time! - What?! You are the one who criticized my child! You are the one who told me you got my disease from your finger! But you must be having fun all the time. What crap a doctor can tell! You! You gave the disease to the doctor! What a bitch! A bad doctor and a bad nurse! - Jerk! - Miss Minegishi! Asshole! Because of you, the doctor's suffering so much! It's not only the doctor! You make your wife suffer, too! And your baby! You should see how your baby was born! Stop it! Nakata! You don't trust me?! Then go to the examining room! Let this jerk see how his baby was born! Mr. Nakata, don't! Doctor, he...? - He shouldn't have seen it. - No. It was a matter of time. The spirochete was already eating up his brain. Nakata. Nakata! Hey! How are you doing? Okay. My body is doing fine. But sometimes I feel like I'm still having a baby. - Tell me, Miss Minegishi. - What? Please tell me the truth. Am I going to end up like Nakata? That's ridiculous! Don't be afraid of even the worst spirochete. If you continue the treatment calmly... orderly, and patiently, you'll be fine. Take for example the doctor. Is it true? Then I still have hope? Of course you do! You don't have children. Your life has just started. I have a child, but I think my life has just begun, too. You can't walk looking down. You have to walk proudly with your chin up high. Well, that's what the doctor says. You like the doctor, don't you? Ms. Akimoto! Ms. Akimoto! Could you help me? Okay. I know. She must be the new nurse. Yes. Minegishi is pretty strict. She is giving her a tough time. She is doing what Ms. Imai did to her. Hey, hey. Kid, your mom is a great nurse now. Right? - Here. - By the way... do you know what the chief says about your son? He says there is a saint among doctors sometimes. A saint? My son is a saint? - Right. - I don't know about that. He is just trying to give hope back... by the people who are unhappier than he is. If he had been happy, he might have become a snob. Please help me, doctor. I have four kids. Doctor... will I be able to go back to work someday? Doctor. THE END
