Carlie, I'll do just one more before the one after that. Carlie. Yeah, ignore me. That's just great. - I'm Kevin. Sophy. - Sophy. - That's a pretty name. - I do all right with it. - Can I buy a drink? - Thanks, but I'm meeting someone. Someone. Boyfriend, husband? I'm not seeing a ring, but lack of ornamentation doesn't necessarily mean shit these days, so? Not really sure. Normally I can tell when I'm wasting my breath on someone. - But you're hard to read. - Wow. - Does this work for you? - You know what, you'd be surprised. - Mm, that's an understatement. - Harsh, but accurate. - So how 'bout that drink? - I told you. You told me, yeah. He, maybe she, she's not here yet. Besides, it's a drink, not a marriage contract. - Another one, Kevin? - Oh at least. - And if the lady would oblige. - Okay, fine. - What'll you have? - Can I do a diet and coconut rum? Took you for a vodka cranberry kinda girl. Aw. There go your instincts. Leading you down the wrong path again. - You know they say that the best rum in the world comes from Jamaica but I can tell you from personal experience nobody beats the Cubans. And here I was thinking that was only cigars. What? No. It's rum too. And I should know, I spent all last year there. For work. I'm a scientist. - Hmm. - Oh yeah. I study the sky, I study the stars. Wow, okay. Didn't ask, but that sounds fun. It is fun. - Thank you. - Thank you, Carlie. So yeah, where were we? - Just leaving. - No! What? No okay. Yeah, don't mention it. (SIGHS) So I guess this is goodbye. Looks that way. Well I'd be lying if I said I was gonna miss you. Ah come on now, Officer Martin. We had some good times. Yeah. Like that time he almost ripped your ear off. Simple misunderstanding is all it was. Little love bite. - And then there's you, Mitchell. - What about me? I can see why they're sending Tullis up to the five yard, but you always struck me as more of a mild type. What'd you do to earn this transfer? - I requested it. - (LAUGHING) - You requested a five yard? - Yeah. I mean I never took you as a rocket scientist. But damn, you can't be that dense. Wait, what's wrong with five yard? Oh don't worry, you'll find out soon enough. Don't listen to 'em, Ronnie, as long as I got your back you got nothing to worry about. That's rich. Doubt all you want, but having me as a friend's a better deal than most folks realize. And that's for getting on my bad side. Yeah and we know how that turns out. This, this could be the end of the line for you now. You're gonna spend the rest of your wasted existence in the deepest, darkest hole the DOC has to offer. Funny thing, that. - What? - Life. It's when you're sure things are going a certain way that fate starts pitching curve balls. Oh boy, oh boy. Shit boy, you look like you're about to have seizure back there. What? No, just nervous. - Hold it quiet, Ronnie. - Huh? Keep it together. Wow. Hey. Ethan. - What? - We have to get up. - Oh no. I don't want to. - I know. But Allie's probably already waiting for us. - Just five more minutes. - Hmm. - Oh yeah. - I know what you're trying to do. - You know nothing. - Okay. I'm going to make us some breakfast and you have five minutes. - Is that a kiss? - It was. - That was sweet. - Hmm, I know. - I love you. - I know. I love you too. Five minutes! - Oh, smells good. - Hmm, yeah. - There's some fresh coffee too. - Yes, thank you. Oh. So did I overhear that right? Allie's got a friend coming with her? - Yeah. A boy she goes to school with. - Boy? - What boy? - Oh it, I can't remember his name. - Crazy. Little Allie's got a boyfriend. - She swears it's not like that. - Right. - What? You think that she wouldn't tell me? No, no, I just think that regardless of what she says I bet the farm he thinks he's got a shot with her. - I mean it's possible. - More than possible. Yeah. Because you were able to climb out of the friend zone with me. Wait, I didn't know I was in the friend zone? Um-hmm. Yeah. - Really? - Big time. Huh. HELLOC A-2090048 What is your status? Approaching sector 19-773264 Cryogenic sleep is stable Hey girl, what you doing this weekend? Going camping with my sister. Are you sure we're even on the right road? I told my sister I'd have the car back an hour ago and.. - Yes dude, just keep going straight. - This road isn't even straight. I'm telling you man, it's gonna be the weekend. - Why? What's happening? - Allie. - Finally getting in there. - Oh bullshit! She's practically been begging for it. Why else do you think she invited me on this camping trip with her? - You're dreaming. - Hmm. Yeah, we'll see. - Sure will. - What, you don't believe me? - Let's bet on it. - You already owe me like 30 bucks. Oh, well double or nothing says I close the deal by Sunday. Keep your money. Well pay me back what you owe me. But keep the rest. Turn here. - That's the place? This is Allie's house? - Pretty nice, right? Oh shit. Anyway I would invite you up but I think Allie wants to spend some alone time with me before her sister picks us up. All right bro. Wish me luck. Good luck. I heard a rumor that Dylan is coming with you guys? - So? - OMG, it's true! We're just friends. Allie? Dylan. Hello? Whoa. Hey. Oh my gosh, Stew get off him. - Hey. - You okay? - Yeah. - Don't worry, he's all bark and no bite. I'll be down in a minute. - Hey. - Hey. - I was just.. - Hungry? - Looking for something to drink. - Oh help yourself. Can I help you find something? My charger, can't remember where I left it. Here it is. What? Nothing. Kevin. Hey. - For Christ sakes, what? - You're sleeping on my floor. - Dammit Kevin, get up. - In a minute, okay? No. Not okay. Come on. - Fuck, Amy, really? - Really. Get up. Then again for those viewers just tuning in, a massive man hunt is under way for these two men, Jacob Tullis and Ronald Mitchell. Details are still unclear. But both men somehow managed to escape last night from the Southerland Correctional Facility. We will keep you posted on this very important story.. - That's crazy. - As it develops. Be safer and smarter with Big Buck's personal guarantee. - Is there any coffee? - It's half past three in the afternoon. All right, how about some of that wine, then? I think you had more than enough last night. Yeah, but that was last night. As for today. - I didn't see you car out there. - Took an Uber. You know me, safety first. We need to talk, Kevin. This isn't gonna be good. You can't use my place as your crash pad anymore. I know. I have no interest in telling you how to live your life, I just, scenes like that are why we broke up. - Got it. - I'm serious. Just because I haven't changed the lock doesn't mean you can barge in in the middle of the night, - pass out on my family room floor. - I hear ya. You say that. - But I don't think ya do. - Oh no, I get it. You dump me and now you need me to let you get on with your life. - Kevin. - Ah! This hangover's killing me. Where's your stemware? Oh fuck it. - What? - You look like shit. Yeah well take into account how drunk I got last night, I think the fact that I'm standing upright is accomplishment enough. God. I don't know how I'm gonna get through my shift tonight. Look, go take a shower, I'll put a pot of coffee on for you, all right? - Hey Ethan. - 'Sup man? - How much further? - 20 minutes tops. I'm not sure I can wait that long. I really have to pee. That's what you get for downing all that soda. Can you pull over real quick? Yeah, sure. Perfect, it's locked. Oh this damn door. Where the hell is he going? I think he's probably just gun shy. - You know how it is. - Such a dork. A cute dork, though. You know, I'm surprised Mom let him come with us. It's not like that. - Really. We're just friends. - Oh yeah, does he know that? Allie, you have to be straightforward when it comes to things like this or he might get the wrong impression. (SIGHS) Much better. Jake, why did we stop? 'Cause you're gushing like a sieve. If we don't change them dressings you'll be gone by morning. I don't like it man, being out in the open like this. Guess you'd rather bleed out then. Keep your head down. I'll be right back. - Afternoon. - You got any first aid kits? Aisle three next to the tools and auto. Thanks. $31.50. Just enough. - Hello, excuse you. - Hey Roy. Ed. Fill up on three. - You got it. - What's that you got on the TV? About last night. Jail break. - They still ain't got 'em? - Apparently not. - Huh. What's the reward? - Didn't say. That'd be a hunt worth joining for sure. Hey Roy, Ed. - Hey Matt. - Matt. Just came down the wire, they're having me pass these out. 10k, that's all these boys is worth to 'em? Hardly worth taking a bullet over. I'm sure they're on a beach somewhere sipping margaritas as we speak. You do me a favor, hang that in your window? Yeah, sure thing. Hey Matt, it's good to have you back in town. I's sorry to hear about your little girl. Yeah, condolences man. Armed and dangerous. Shit. For 20k maybe. - What the hell took you so damn long? - You see that cop? Yeah, I saw him. - Question is did he see you? - I don't think so. - Let's get the hell outta here. - Not gonna argue with that. - Yo Jake. The highway's back that way. - Fuck the highway. - What? - There'll be checkpoints every 50 miles - from here to the border. - What then? Cut through the park. Might be the slow road, but it spills out a stone's throw from old Mexico. - I don't know man. - You gotta learn to trust me a little more, Ronnie. I got us this far, didn't I? In case you didn't notice I'm bleeding to death. Man, there's no pleasing some. Helloc A-2090048 What is your status? Approaching Sector Z-773592 Solar System 00471 - (PHONE RINGS) - Buck's Brakes.

I mean as small as that shit's gotta be. At least it stands tall, huh? You seem to know an awful lot about Lil Buck's member. Is that the answer to the question how you got this job? - Fuck you, man. - Oh hey Doc. You know I plumb forgot I had an appointment today. All right, well I'll be right over. Thanks for calling to remind me. See you in a short while. - You boys seen Lil Buck around? - Yes sir. He actually just took off with Ms. Gina. Gina Waxman?

Meteor impact approximately 1900 hours. Coordinates 43.7 I739 and.. - What the hell? - What does that mean? I'm picking up a signal. Patching into it. - That noise? - Holy shit. - What is it? - Shh!

Sure did. - What? - You have any idea how sexy you look holding that? (CHUCKLES) Wait. Okay. You are so hot. Yeah? Hell yes. Are you ready for your close up? You're such a dumb ass. What the fuck? - What, did you forget to charge it? - I guess so. Who cares. - This is crazy! - You musta blown the breaker. I'm gonna go check the fuse box. All right, hurry! Come on, come on. Come on, come on. Shit. 112-617 to dispatch, do you copy? 112, this is 617 to dispatch, do you copy? Great. - Hector, what's taking so long? - It's not the breakers. - And the backup generator is also offline too. - Okay, what does that mean? I don't know, but the odds of them both going, and then there's this. Grab your phone. They're not working. Anything electrical around here isn't working. Interesting. Right before we lost power I recorded some kind of energy surge in there. It's possible the surge caused a massive short. - What does that mean? - It means that some kind of electronic emission has actually managed to cause a full blackout. - And what are we gonna do? - You do as you like. I'm heading to that impact site. Did you cum? You gonna take me home? Oh so soon? You know how this works. What, being the guy on the side? Yeah, it's fucking great. Really? What? I don't know. Car won't start. - Can I see your phone? Mine's dead. - Yeah. - And so's yours. - No, it's fully charged. Oh perfect, I was coming back for a flare. This is even better. Why don't you just come with me, man? No. Whatever caused this could be dangerous. It could also be a find of some real scientific significance. And I'm not passing up the opportunity to be the guy that first discovered it. So what do ya say? That's the spirit. Really? - Son of a.. - My tablet's dead. - Just like my phone. - Yeah, mine too. God damn. Rose, Allie, I was just gonna go looking for you guys. Strangest thing happened. We saw something crash and like a beam or something. - And suddenly our phones died. - Ours too. Yeah, I was just trying to charge mine at the car but I can't even get the car to start. - This is getting scary. - Wait a minute. You guys said you saw something crash? - Like a meteor. - Followed by beam. Crazy. What do you guys think it.. - Shh, hear that? - Hey there. - Hey. - Our car died all of the sudden and I saw your fire. I was hoping you folks could lend us a jump. Yeah, I don't think a jump is gonna help you man. - Why's that? - For some reason ours won't start either. - Shit. - I'd offer you my phone, but it's dead too. It's kind of an emergency. See my buddy and me we're out hunting and he accidentally shot himself. If I don't get him some help soon he's not gonna last through the night. - Where is he? - Back at the car. Boy's lost a lotta blood. Maybe you fellas could help me move him, spare some water. - I don't know, man. - I'd be much obliged to ya. Look, I'm sorry to trouble you, but if we don't at least keep him hydrated he won't make it through the night. I guess I'll go. Look, we've gotta help the guy. It'll be okay. All right. What's the matter? It's incredible. I don't like this. Oh wow! - Is that a? - Yeah. - It looks like he's hurt from the crash. - Maybe we should go get some help. And leave my discovery behind for anyone else to claim? Not happening. (ELECTRICITY SPARKING) Fuck! Hey Kevin, you okay? Good job, Kevin. It's an energy field protecting the alien in case it falls unconscious or something, like a defense mechanism. Hey, something's happening man. No, no, no! - Is this you? - This is me. Okay. Hey Ronnie man, I got you some wa. Ronnie? Damn. - Is he okay? - Shit brother. What's up? What's the matter, is he okay? He's dead. Are you sure? Maybe he's just.. Leave it alone. Okay. Hey, hey, yo, I think it's a cop. Hey man are you, are you a cop? Okay thank God. - Can you help us? - What's wrong? There's a dead guy in the car and we're, we're stuck out here. Thanks. Hey man. Is there a problem? No. No problem. He's, he's in the car. Easy now. - Shit. What the hell man? - Or you're gonna end up just like him. Now we're gonna do this real nice and easy. Okay just, just put down the gun. Next one's for you, law dog. My hands are in the air, I'm not moving. Okay stud. - You're up. Really slow now. - What, what? I want you to reach and take Johnny's piece and hand it to me. Just do what he says kid. There. I feel better already. Just so you don't get any ideas, I don't miss what I aim at. No ideas. - Are we cool? - Move. Both of ya. Try it now. - Nothing. - Piece of shit. You know we could've walked back to town by now. Oh, and leave my truck out here? Yeah, the hicks'll be using it for target practice. I don't think so. Look, just crank it again. I've been fucking trying, Buck. (THUDDING) Buck? Oh my god. (ROARING) (GUNFIRE BOOMS) Who's out there? God dammit Smiley, man, if that's you this shit ain't fucking funny. (GUNFIRE BOOMS) (SNORING) Hey. Tiler. - Tiler. - Hmm? - You're snoring. Babe. - I'm sorry baby. (SNORING) Oh dammit, Tiler. Sorry, it's just one of those things I can't help. No, I know. Where are you going? - Gotta pee. - Where are you going? Pam? Babe? Pam? No, no! No. Pam! No Pam. What hap? Pam, oh my god. No! No! Pam. You're back. Thank god, I was getting nervous. - What's wrong? - Evening, y'all. Let me introduce you to Johnny law dog. He's gonna be joining us. - Ethan, what the hell's that? - Just, just be cool. That's right, cool as cucumbers. And we won't have any more problems. Make sure you tie him off nice and tight now. All finished? Yeah. - That leaves only you. - No. Come on man. - Dylan! - What the hell, man? What? You act like I shot him. Hey, listen to me. This doesn't have to go this way. Don't I know it, law dog. Don't I know it. - Come on man, you're taking our food. - First rule of survival. Well folks, it's been a real pleasure but I must be on my way. Come on boy. - Come on boy. - No! Come on. What? - Go, go, go. - Go, go, go! - Oh, shit! - Oh my God! Ethan! Come on, come on, come on, let's go! Come on! - Let's go! - Come on, let's go, let's go. - Shit. - Rose. - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, I just took a bad step. - Okay well let's move. - Come on. God. Worse than you thought? Yeah, I twisted it. It hurts like hell when I try to move it. You guys go ahead. - I'll do my best to keep up. - No way. Yeah, we're not splitting up. Dammit Allie, you saw what that thing did to Ethan. - That's why we're not leaving you. - No, go! - Hey kid, what's your name? - Now! - Dylan? - Dylan come gimme a hand. - Okay, is this any better? - Oh, it hurts. Okay, we gotta move slow, but we're gonna keep moving, okay? Okay. Well, look what we got here. - This is it. - This is what? - Here, gimme your hand. - Thanks, gimme a second. Sit down. Search and rescue's been abandoned for a while now. There might be a first aid kit around here somewhere. - Any water? - I'm not sure. You'd have to look around. Let me see how bad it is. How can you see what you're doing? Ha! And let there be light. - Are you crazy, Dylan? Put that out. - Why? You don't think that's gonna attract whatever that thing is out there? How are we supposed to fix your sister's leg in the dark? He's got a point. Okay. - I'm gonna have to set this. - Yeah, okay. - It's gonna hurt. - I know, yeah. Okay. - Ready? - Yeah. Just do it already. Okay here we go. Okay. Okay, the worst of it's behind you. What now? - Splint, hopefully some bandages. - No, I mean, what are we gonna do? What's the plan? We're gonna head back into town. Try and find some help. Ethan. Oh my god, I can't believe he's dead. Find anything good? Should make for a halfway decent splint. So have you ever seen anything like whatever the hell that was back there? No. It's definitely no animal I've ever seen. - Yeah, almost looks like.. - Something out of this world. Come on, that's crazy. I'm sure what the hell that thing was. There's one thing I do know, - it's a hunter. - And we're the prey. Yeah, something like that. Then why are we holed up here like some sitting ducks? Hey, that girl's really hurt. When she's up for it, we'll move. Look man, I feel I gotta be straight with you, all right? Whatever the odds are about running that thing and making it back to town, they get substantially better if we're not slowed down by Rose and her busted leg. - Some friend you are. - I don't even know her, man. - Wow. - I mean, I've been trying to tap the younger sister but she's been blue balling me all semester. So no great loss there either. Am I right? Listen, pal. If you think I'm gonna keep you from leaving, I'm not. - If you wanna go, go. - I don't know the way. Head south and hope for the best. Good luck to ya. Jesus man, tight enough? You're cutting off my circulation. Sorry partner. You already broke outta one clinker and I ain't about to take no chances. Fuck man, you gotta hear me. We ain't safe here. No worry son, old Roy gonna take good care of you. Just gotta get that truck started first. Ah dammit. That's not gonna do any good, man. You're not gonna get this thing to start. Ye of little faith. You don't understand man, nothing's working. No phones, no flashlights, anything with electronics've been fried by the monster. - The monster? - Whatever you wanna call it. This thing that attacked us. Trust me man, you don't wanna cross paths with it. Yeah, don't fret, son. Old Roy's not gonna let nothing happen to you 'fore he can collect that reward. But, it would appear you're in the right about the truck. So... we walk out. On your feet, now. Are we ever gonna get out of here? - How you feeling? - Better. - Will you give it a shot? - Yeah. Finally! - How much further? - Just over the bluff is the freeway. - Then it's all pavement, okay? - God. Are you okay to keep going? Yeah just, just gimme a minute. - Sit down. - Shit. - What was that Dylan? - I didn't say anything. - Unbelievable. - What the hell is your problem? - Look, she's just slowing us down, okay? - Give her a break. She's hurt. - I can't believe you're being like this. - Yeah? Well believe it, 'cause there's no way in hell I'm gonna die out here in the middle of nowhere. - How can you be so selfish? - I'm selfish 'cause I wanna live? - No, selfish because you.. - He's right. I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. Stop talking like that. Just rest here for a second and we'll help you the rest of the way. - Right? - Yeah, whatever. - Shit. - Run, run, run! - Run, run, run, run. - Shit. Almost back to town. Hey, keep moving. Whoa. You see that? - What? - Somebody's coming. - God damn you're jumpy. - See? There. - Could be him. - Him? The monster, man. - The monster? Keep moving! - No, fuck that. You wanna shoot me, go ahead. But I'm not taking another step. Don't tempt me, tough guy. Hey! Who's out there? - Quiet man. - Shut it. - Hell. Just a skinny kid. - Oh gees. - Hey. - Howdy. - You. - Hey kid. Mister, watch this guy, he tried to rob us. Don't you worry boy, I got him well under control. - Where are you taking him? - Back to town. Turn him into the sheriff. - Can I tag along? - Suit yourself. But I ain't splitting the reward. Whatever. I just need to find my way back to town. Move. Well come on then. - Wait, wait, wait. - What? We're going the wrong way. This is, this is further into the desert. - No. - Oh shit. With all the confusion I lost my bearing. Well which way's the right way? I don't know. It's hard to tell. Shit! I'm really sorry. - It's definitely past midnight. - Yeah. It means it's the 11th. It's my daughter's birthday. Oh. How old is she? She would've been six. Would have? She passed away four months ago. Oh, I'm sorry. I figured if I came back to work early, kept myself busy, that would've been the right decision. But after today, I'm having second thoughts about that. Okay, let's try this again, okay? Well if we head that way we're liable. to run into that thing again. Yeah, you're right. We're gonna go this way. And that thing, I noticed the last few shots that I put into it, it seemed to slow it down. Hopefully a couple more will stop it for good. You think so? I'm gonna hope so. Come on. Hey man, what's your name? - Don't worry about it. - Anyway, you saw that thing. Can you please explain to Grizzly Adams here what we're up against? You should stop talking. I'm trying to tell him blunderbuss won't save us if we come across it again. Hey, one more word and I swear to god I'll kill you. Yeah, well that thing has already killed two of us already, so I think it's safe to say if it finds us we're all fucked. What? Now you've seen this monster man too? - Yeah. - Well I don't care what's out here. Ain't nothing keeping me from my reward money. Speaking of the devil. - What the hell is that? - Shoot it! Come on man, untie me. Why, so you can ditch us like last time? Look, the only way we're gonna survive this thing is if all hands are on deck. Jesus kid at least gimme a fighting chance against that thing. Think you can live through this without my help? Now fucking untie me! Okay. This way, old boy's done for. Where do you think it came from? Well I've heard stories over the years about sightings or whatever you wanna call 'em. Sightings? Never really thought about it until tonight. Wait, you mean like? - Like aliens. - That's crazy. - Do you smell that? - Yeah. You asked me how it got here. It has to travel somehow, right? Yeah, like a flying saucer? A spacecraft of some kind. - Yeah, I wonder. - What? Well, this afternoon we were at the lookout peak and we saw something fall outta the sky. Not sure what it was though, but it landed pretty close to us. Well I have a feeling we're about to find out. - Where are we going? - To get my gun. - What good is that gonna do? - Better to have it than not. Besides, the bullets back there hurt it more than before. - Yeah, it did look that way. - See? We agree on stuff. This partnership might just work. You should gather any supplies you can fit in that bag. - You pretty much took everything else. - Okay then. Let's go. Hey. We gotta get going. - I can't do this. - What happened? My sister's dead and Ethan is. Listen to me, okay? I know it seems hard right now but we gotta keep moving. Do we have any other plan besides wandering around in the dark? We're gonna stick to my plan and that's to move into town. I hardly got to see her since she moved away to college. This trip was supposed to be a fun weekend together. And she just got engaged and.. I get it. Sometimes losing the ones we love the most is what life hits us the hardest with. Yeah. - And to think. - What? I know you came here to meet that boy. If I see him again I'm kicking him in his nuts. Come on. So what happened? How'd you get separated from your friends? - I left 'em. - Why? Well her sister broke her leg and started slowing us down. I told 'em leave her ass behind. Survival of the fittest, common sense. They didn't wanna leave her. So I took off. Damn. - And I thought I was cold. - Whatever. So what happened to your friend that was shot? - He's dead. - No shit. - How'd that happen? - Running from the law. Trying to get to freedom. What's that? - No idea. - Looks like campers. You know what that means. More supplies. Oh wow. Come on. Are you crazy? I'm not getting any closer to that thing. We gotta keep moving. - Oh boy. - Oh shit. There's another one. Ah, this is not definitely not good. Ew. I think I just stepped in poo. I don't think that's poo. At least not from any animal I've ever seen. I just stepped in alien shit? I'll find something to help you clean it, okay? - Did you find something? - Yeah, I found something. What's that? I have no idea. You know what I think, whatever that thing is, was already hurt when this crashed. - What are you getting at here? - Hopefully it is already hurt. If we're lucky it's dying. Come on. - You hear that? - We're not alone. - Come on. - What the! - You gotta be kidding me. - Stop, both of you. - Listen out of the good ear now. - You're lucky he's here or I'd be kicking your ass right now. What's with everyone trying to kick my ass tonight? - Shit. - What brings you guys here? - To ask you the same thing. - Following the smoke? What the hell is that thing? You should put your gun down and go find out. Oh I'll find out with my gun. And I'll be taking yours too. Go on, take his gun. Sorry to do this to ya again but I can't have you shoot me while my back is turned. All right, let's go have a look see. - Move. - I can't believe you left us. Your sister would've gotten us all killed. - You're an unbelievable asshole. - Yeah, but I'm alive. Holy, this can't be what it looks like. I'm pretty sure that's how it got here. He really is a freaking space man. Why don't you go take a closer look? It found us. What the hell is it waiting for? I'd say it's trying to size us up, decide which one's the weakest link. I'm defenseless here, man. Help me out. All I'm trying to do is make my way to Mexico and both you and this thing stand in the way of that. So no, officer, I will not give you your gun back. What are you waiting for, dude? Shoot! Here we go. Go, go, go, go, go! - What's wrong? - I'm tired of running. We gotta keep moving or that thing's gonna catch up with us. - Exactly, my point. - What are you talking about? It doesn't matter how much you run, that thing's just gonna catch up to us. If we just stay here, that doesn't change anything. - Where are you going? - I don't know! We have no weapons, we gotta keep running. I heard something, move! Come here, move, move. Hey scumbag. Put that thing down before you hurt yourself. You've been nothing but trouble since we've met you. Just looking out for the one that matters most. - Me. - Look where it's got you. Okay, gimme the gun, gimme the gun, gimme the gun. Just a few more shots and I think we can kill that thing. - What are you saying? - We can try to set up a trap for it, like an ambush. - That's crazy! - Girl has a point. Shut up! I've had enough outta you. I've been outgunned or outnumbered or outmatched my whole life. The only reason I'm still here is 'cause I know a thing or two about this cat and mouse game. Okay, you know what, that's enough convict wisdom for the night. - Okay, we're leaving, let's go. - Come on man, think about it. Girl's right. We've already managed to hurt it bad. All we gotta do now is finish it off. Look here, it's always attacked us one at a time. Say we strategize a little bit we might just get the upper hand for once. We tried running, Matt. That thing killed Rose. If we're gonna die tonight, I'd rather die trying to fight back. Listen to yourselves. It's crazy talk. I'm leaving. Law dog's afraid to stand and fight. Coward. I told you to sit there and keep your mouth shut. - Prove me wrong then. - So what if we run, Matt? If we're lucky enough to make it to town that thing's just gonna follow us. Right now there's only three of us in danger. But as soon as you hit civilization those numbers go up. Fine. Fine. We'll try it your way. So what's the plan, law dog? First things first, you're gonna stop calling me that. Hail Zeplon. We've locked onto your coordinates. How long till you arrive? I have sustain heavy damage. We'll be there by moon's end. (PHONE VIBRATES) - Guys, look. - Oh wow. Whatever the creature did it must've worn off. It didn't wear off. It's dying and losing its power. Shit. We just might make it through this after all. 617 to dispatch, do you copy? Dispatch 617, do you copy? Shit! - The power must've went off. - Or they're all dead. Gimme your phone. There's no signal. We get back into town.. Anything to avoid a fight. Why can't you see this for what it is? Thing's on its knees. Now it's time to finish it off. I'm taking you both into town and we're waiting for backup. And that's it. Then remove the cuffs and gimme my gun so I can finish it. I know when to scrap and when to scurry and now's not the time to scurry. You know what, if you wanna deal with this thing so bad, you be my guest. Best of luck. I can't. - Run along now, friend. - Sorry Matt. You listen to me, okay? This is a big mistake. Okay? You're gonna get hurt. Maybe. Looks like he was expecting us. - So much for the element of surprise. - Hey cowboy. You don't look so good. All right, he's getting ready to strike. When he does I'll go left, you go right. Understand? Yeah. Come on man, take him out. What are you waiting for? - Gotta get a clear shot. - I can't hold him much longer, dammit. Take the shot. You alright? Oh shit. - I got shot. - Yeah. I thought you were dead. Takes more'n a gunshot wound to get rid of me. Come on, we gotta take care of this. - You alright? - Yeah. Is it dead? Yeah, looks that way. Jake saved my life. Yeah, I guess he did, didn't he? You two cut that hero shit out. Hey, are you sure we're heading the right way? Trust me. - I've found my bearings. - Don't worry, if we gets lost, - I can always find my way to Mexico. - Still trying to escape? I ain't going back to jail. (siren wails) - Did you hear that? - Man you must have dog ears. Yeah, that must be the first responders. Come on. - Holy shit. - I'll say. It's like no one responded. They're all fighting for their lives. Looks like the fight's just getting started.
