Come on, boys! Let's go! Look at 'em, Cage. Ready to bust loose. Pretty soon they'll be jumpin' fences. Tomorrow we'll let 'em run, not today. Little rustle in the air, boys. Time to get inside. Ain't they something, Billy? - Have you ever seen horses like 'em? - Not quite. Come on! Get inside. Let's get into town and out before this hits. Jacob, how's the missus? Glad to see ya. - Fellas, Mr. Ballard. - Howdy. My God. Looks like half the association's shown up. We appreciate it, gentlemen. Mr. Ballard, we're gonna win this fight. Thank you. Good luck to you, Ballard, cuttin' Carey Sartin off from water. You just bought that tract to spite him. Hey, Morgan! Pete! All of ya. You didn't need it. Hope it makes you feel good. You sayin' a man can't buy land when he wants to? I'm sayin' Carey's hardworkin'. I think you've gone a little bit too far this time, Ballard. Now, come on, Shelby. Let's be friends, huh? Nobody wants that old rock garden of yours anyway. Be friends. Come on. Kermit Dover? - Get out here. - Excuse me. On a sweet Sunday when I ought to be home resting my poor old bones... and you makin' a fuss over a petition for statehood. - Where'd you get this idea? - It's in from Cheyenne. All official. - Who says it's official? - Judge Wilkins has seen it. - That good enough for you? - There's a delegation comin'... in a month to make Cheyenne the capital city. - Look who signed up, Slater. - Hunter Jarvis. - Big and bold like John Hancock. - That Slater looks sideways on alcohol. You suppose he just forgot the good turn we done him when he got flooded out... last spring and the bank said "no"? Hunter! I need to remind you of somethin'. Hunter has gone. He probably heard I was gonna come and reason with him. - What do you think of that, Ollie? - Look like a three dollar bill to me. Myrl, how 'bout you? You're a smart young man with a future. Where do you stand? Statehood ain't worth fussin' over. - Cora, let me help you. - Is that so? It's gonna happen, no matter what. Next year, five years from now. I wouldn't waste your sweet Sunday worryin'. Wait it out is my thought. And the vermin will sweep in like a grass fire. The only people I see around here are hardworkin'. Eyesores and riffraff. You talkin' about me? What do you say, Cora? Do I look like an eyesore? No, sirree. You're a handsome man and my sweetheart forever. Smart little lady. Honey, Cage is waitin' for us. We gotta get movin'. You're a horse trader. You pull your weight in town, unlike some other folks. But I don't need no strangers from Cheyenne... come in tellin' me who I got to neighbor with... where to put my road, my fence... tellin' me what's mine and what ain't. I founded Rawlins. I made it. I thought Indian traders and trappers come here first. I put my roots and my law down here, boy, when you was still just a pup. I got a wife and two sons in the ground. Now, your bein' new to the territory... maybe you ought to plant your feet and take a stand. Now, to say the truth, I wasn't gonna sign the petition for statehood. I didn't think it was that important. But since you put my character to the test... You hand me that paper you got there, Kermit, and a pencil? - Sure. - There ya go. I'm a free man like you, Ballard. I can say "yes," and I can "say" no. I say "yes" to statehood. I bought a lot of horses from you, boy. From now on, maybe you ought to sell 'em in Cheyenne, if you can get there. Doesn't matter one way or the other where I sell 'em, Mr. Ballard. I give you the same fair price I give everybody. Now, if you've got some other stand you'd like me to take... I'd be more than glad to accommodate you. Let's go, Myrl. Will you please? Let's go. Good afternoon. Thanks, Myrl. - See ya, Myrl. - Bye, Cora. You didn't sell no horses today. I said what was true. You don't always have to say what's true. I'll do better at the auction in Casper. That man's sure got a bug up his twirl. He's runnin' for somethin', isn't he? You showed him up in front of town. He ain't gonna forget that. Aw, he'll get over it. Come on, pony! Right over here. I know how you feel. But that's the way it is with the horse trade, Cage. You grow to love the animals you raise... but there comes a time when you got to sell 'em. I need cash to run the farm, pay wages, you know? That's the way it is. You got it. That's the way it is. But be happy with what you and Billy did. These are beautiful stallions. They're gonna make Clay Williams happy and we're gonna earn a profit... to buy the land we need. - Right? - Yeah. Okay. Come on. Let's load 'em up now. You see that dog? You wash him, or I'll sell him too. Safe trip. Be back in a few weeks, sooner if the weather holds. Take care of your mama, Cage. - Sure, Pa. - Surprise me with a present, Myrl. - Like what? - Ooh, like, uh... Some nice soap, maybe somethin' sweet, and... Oh, a bicycle! And some of those fancy bloomers from the Sears Roebuck catalog! And cellophane like they have at the world's fair in Paris. - And don't forget lamp oil! - What? Otis elevator. Come on now. Step up. Hey, Myrl! Has Woody always been a dusty old cuss? As far as I know. See, Billy, I was thinkin' when I get to Casper... I just might grab me a bath. Come on, now, step up. Here we go. Straight on through. Come on, now. Step up. How you figure that, Myrl? Good-lookin' fence you got, Slater. What's it for? - Keep rustlers out, mister. - I didn't know Ballard owned this land. I just bought a new parcel. It's all official, papers and all. - Cost you ten dollars to come through. - Ten dollars? - Yes, sir. - This pass is closed, Mr. Redding. - You ought not go too far, Ballard. - How's that? Puttin' up a fence and charging. Well, rustlers like to slip in, pick off strays. I get the fence, all right, but what about the ten dollars? - Keeps the riffraff out. - You're makin' trouble, is all. Look, I got no cause with you horse traders. Come and go as you like. Where are you headed? - Casper, for the auction. - Mind if I take a look at what you got? Looking's free. - How much for these blacks? - They're sold. Little knotheaded, but put a pistol to my head, I'd give ya fifty each. - What do you think, Ollie? - We need work horses. Yeah, we do. And since you ain't heard the new rules till now... I'd let you come and go two... no, three times... for one of them blacks. No sale. The it'll cost you ten dollars to pass. Pay Slater. Ain't got ten dollars to give. I got to pay for food and lodging in Casper. - Then go around. - Auction'll be over before I get there. That ain't my doin'. Ten dollars. Oh, I near forgot. You're gonna need a permit. You gotta have one. Gotta be official. Must have crossed 50 times without one. Where am I supposed to get a permit? You can see Judge Wilkins in Rawlins, or you could get one in Casper. Yeah, Elmo Whitaker in Casper. He'll write you one up. You know Elmo, don't you? I'll give you five now and the rest when I come back. Good enough? How do we know you're comin' back this way? Because I said I would. Maybe the horse dealer could put up some security. Now, that is a good thought, Ollie. You know, I try to be a reasonable man. I'll go along with ya. Just leave the two blacks and pick 'em up on your way back. Take it or leave it. I ain't got all day. Billy, cut the blacks off the string and leave 'em. - Don't leave the stallions here, Myrl. - Put up the roans if you have to. - The blacks is promised to Williams. - Leave 'em... or go the long way around. - That'll do. - All right. - Don't do it, Myrl. - I ain't got no choice. I ain't got the money, and the auction's in a week. You stay with 'em, Billy. We'll pick you up on the way back. - I ain't feedin' no Crow. - He gotta sleep in the barn. Take what you need from the pack horse. Been a real pleasure doin' business with you, Mr. Reddings. Let 'em through, Slater. - Son of a bitch. - Hey, come on, now. Let's turn this thing over and get this out of the way. Mr. Reddings has got to come through. No way. He's gone too far. Pretty soon we'll be goin' around the Rio Grande to get to Casper. - Hey, Myrl? - What? There ain't no use payin' attention to that old man. - What do you make of all of this? - Like a church with no roof. You got the Almighty braggin' His head off. Yeah. What do you figure He's saying? Remember who did this. Don't get to big for your britches. I guess. Fair enough. Seventy-one, eighty. Look at this. Now 80. Now 90. And now $200. Howdy, Browder. - Myrl. - Seen Elmo Whitaker? He's over there somewheres. - What do ya say, partner? - Woody! Good to see you. There it is. - Hey. - Yes, indeed. - Where's the stallions? - Henry Ballard got 'em. I thought Myrl promised 'em to Clay Williams. Ballard's holding 'em till Mryl pays him a toll for crossing his property. I heard about that gate. Ballard's crazy tryin' something like that. Yeah. Myrl's pretty angry about it. - Don't blame him. - Say, Browder... you ever hear tell of one of them English dogs, Jack Russell Terrier dogs? Can't say I have. They say if you get 'em riled up enough and they sink their teeth into you... you're just gonna have to saw their jaw apart before they let go. And that right there is Myrl Redding right about now. A man with a bull head and a Jack Russell jaw. Quite a sight. I'll see ya, partner. See ya later. I got him at twenty, now five... - He told you to see me? - That's what he said. He's fuckin' the dog on you, Myrl. Ain't no such thing as a pass for a pass. He owns the land. He's been buying land like it's goin' out of style. But I don't know what this permit crap is all about. - Including that parcel around the pass? - Oh, yeah. And he can do what he wants with the land? Unless the governor steps in, and that's a long wiggle down the road. - How's business, Elmo? - Pretty good. - Cheatin' the hell out of 'em, are you? - Only them that tries to cheat me. Take care. At 25 now, one at 75. A 50 now, 60, 70. Now at 70, now 80. One hundred, two hundred and fifty. That's it, and I got mine. What'll I tell Clay Williams? Tell him I'll be back in spring. I'll have the horses if he still wants 'em. - He still wants 'em, all right. - Tell him I mean to keep my word. - All right. - Pleasure doin' business with you. Have a safe trip. - Take care, Woody. - Browder. Ma'am, do you realize that you are bidding against your husband? My foot's in the stirrup My bridle in my hand Good-bye, old Sue I'm leavin' Cheyenne Good-bye, Old Paint I'm leavin' Cheyenne I come for my horses, Slater. - You owe me five dollars. - Pay him. - Where are they? - They're around. Billy! They ain't in here, Slater. I said they're around. Woody, check the corral. Easy, now. Bastards. Easy, now, boy. - It's okay. - It's all right. Come on. Oh, Christ. Slater! Come out here, boy. I want to talk to you. Those are not my horses. What did you do to my horses? I didn't do nothin'. Why don't you ask your Crow? I will when I find him. Where is he? Jesus, I don't know. He was makin' trouble. Sores on 'em! Tied to a pigsty! 'Cause your Crow took off. I can't take care of 'em by myself. - You've been workin' 'em in the field. - What's the trouble here? Listen, I should have put the dogs on him, boss. What did you do to my animals? He's bitchin' about me working his horses too much. He says they ain't his. Maybe he wants you to buy 'em. - I wouldn't sell you a coyote. - Did you get his five dollars? - Yeah, he's paid up. - Then get your horses and get. I can't move 'em 'cause they can't walk and I ain't gonna injure 'em any more. I left you with well-fed and healthy horses, and I want 'em back that way. - Them is all you're gonna get. - These are not my horses! I don't even recognize 'em. You got two weeks to put 'em back into condition. Two weeks, two years... I ain't gonna condition nothin'. Two weeks, old man. You got somethin' you want to say to me? Yeah. I'm tired of your statehoodin' mouth. In your spittin' image, Ballard. Healthy and fat. - Whoa! - Myrl. - Where's Billy? - He's inside. - Where is he? - He's in the kitchen. Sorry about the horses. - What happened? - Slater... - Slater run me off. - Why? Long as I was there he couldn't work the blacks to death. I told him they were young and they'd never been in harness. He tied 'em to a pigsty in the mud. Wouldn't take the harness off. After a week, they were filthy. One day I came out... he had 'em hooked up to a log pull. Come on, now! For Christ's sake! Then that ol' Slater and Ollie... they beat me, then they set them dogs on me. They might have killed me if I'd went back there. You did right leavin'. - Why don't you let Billy eat? - I ought to kill 'em. Boy. - What? - Why don't you let Billy eat? Rest easy. Damn it! What are you gonna do? Get my horses back the way I left 'em and damages for Billy. Ballard ain't gonna do that 'cause you tell him to and pay Billy to boot. He'd be the laughingstock of Rawlins. You're settin' yourself up for a fall, Myrl. Ballard ain't gonna do what you want him to. He just won't. Yes, he will. You got chores to do, boy? - Yes, sir. - Then get to 'em. I don't know, Myrl. - Ballard's got a lot of friends. - What does the law say I can do? - Well, you could sue him. - Then I want to sue him. - It's not as simple as that. - Why not? Well, you gotta figure on things like how much it's gonna cost ya. - Can you win? - I don't care what it costs. You go up against Ballard in this town, you're gonna go through Judge Wilkins. Now, Wilkins has got shares in Ballard's cattle association. I want my horses back in the condition I left them and damages for Billy. - Do you wanna handle it? - Jesus, Myrl. You're askin' Wilkins to rule for you and an injun against Ballard? I believe that God is to man as man is to animal. You treat 'em with respect. You set dogs on a man, you pay for it. Now, the law upholds these ideas, and I mean to see the law has its day. Do you want to handle it? I'm trying to tell you something here. You're wastin' your money. Yes or no? I'll file if you want me to file. Cost you $20 in advance. - Twenty dollars? - In advance. Half now and the rest when I see what you come up with. Now, you file it. Sure. Two boxes. Here we go, Myrl. It's good havin' you back. I think you paid up last time, so we're gonna start fresh. - Okay. - Mr. Redding. You got two swaybacks stinkin' up Mr. Ballard's stable. I'd appreciate it if you'd pick 'em up real soon, ya hear? Otherwise, we're liken to... chop 'em up for slop or somethin'. All right, Slater. You wanna take it on back to the room? Kermit, next time Ballard or one of his fools comes in... tell 'em the law will take care of Ballard. And if the law don't take care of him, I'm gonna take care of him. One way or the other, there's gonna be justice. I will have it. Ballard himself is gonna feed and groom my stallions... make 'em shiny and beautiful, just like I left 'em. No matter what it costs me, that's gonna happen... sure as sunshine. Will you tell Mr. Ballard that if you see him? Hear me. I speak the truth. And poker as usual at my place Tuesday night. - I appreciate the help, Judge. - You're welcome. Oh, Judge! Judge Wilkins! I was just comin' up to see ya. I don't have time for you today, Rayborn. Come around next week. We're waitin' on your decision, Judge. It's been a couple of weeks now. It's been a couple of weeks now, Judge. My client's getting nervous about this. Sit down, Rayborn. You make me nervous. Yes, sir, Judge. I'm just waitin' for your decision, Judge. I, uh, hope the petition was in proper legal form. The way a justice of your integrity is used to seeing. Nothin' special. It was okay. You talked this petition over with Redding? Yes, sir. Seems like a pissy-ant fuss to me. Redding wants to file that suit, or is that your idea? Oh, no. I give him counsel to the contrary, Judge. Mind's made up. Tell him to take his horses home and forget it. Well, ya see, my client views them as prize stallions, Judge. "Prize" is in the mind, Counselor. Ballard don't want 'em, so what's Redding gonna do? Leave 'em there? - Well, it's like the charges says... - I know what the charges say. Yes, sir. Foolishness, prideful foolishness is what this is. If I was you, I'd talk sense into him. I got five towns to cover, Counselor, and you bring me this? I don't have time for a hearing. Fifty dollars for Billy Redwood? A Crow? Jesus H. Well, I give him honest, realistic counsel on that. Ya did? He wants it filed. Just wonderin' when you want a hearin'. That's all. Well, you don't have to decide right now. Just when you get a chance. Ain't gonna be one. I'm throwin' the case out. Lack of evidence. I advise you to tell Redding to pick up his horses and get on with his life. - Yes sir, Judge. - And I advise you... to pick your clients more carefully if you want to do business in this town. - Yes, sir. - You're hauling shit up a mountain. Careful it don't spill on ya. Shit up a mountain. Thank you, sir. Hey, Myrl. Word is Ballard's still workin' them horses in the field. - Where'd you hear that? - Mac Turner's come in through Casper. Says he saw 'em. Thought they were yours. Maybe not, though. Just take him longer to put 'em back into shape. Well, there ain't nothin' more I can do, Myrl. 'Cept, maybe, uh... Billy, leave the room, would ya? I want to say somethin' plain. Anything you got to say to me, you can say in front of Billy. Well, word I get is, Ballard wants to do business with you. He wants to settle with you on the horses. - But he won't pay Billy. - Why not? - Billy give him trouble and run off. - Billy didn't run off! Ballard's fools run him off. The suit stands the way it's writ. Well, then, he won't settle with ya. It's gonna be a standoff. - Not to my mind. - Well, what else you gonna do? Whatever it takes. - Cage, you want more stew? - Please. Are we ever gonna get our horses back? I don't know, Cage. Now, you sleep tight. You let me worry about it. I'm goin' to Cheyenne to see the governor... before any of this happens. You know, or whoever runs the law. If that don't work... I'm thinkin' about it. - Doin' it all over again, ain't ya? - Don't you know me? Know there's no way I can let a man do what that man did? - That it's not possible? - I know you. If people are gonna kick me, I'd rather be a dog than a man, Cora. So if justice is to be done, don't deny me the freedom I need to get it. No. This is not just about you and what you think is right. I'm a part of you, and so is Cage. - We just get thrown in? Is that it? - Cora, please, keep your voice down. - Cage is listenin'. - I'm not sayin' don't go after Ballard. But you're doin' exactly what he wants you to do... to scare people away. Let me try something, Myrl, my way. If it don't work, then you do what you have to do. - I'll stand with you no matter what. - What are you talkin' about, Cora? You know I'm better at politickin' than you are. Let me go to Cheyenne for us. I know the attorney general's wife... Judith Metcalfe, I met her at the statehood rally last year in Casper. I spent the whole afternoon with her. She'll get the petition to her husband. That'll be the end of it. You get the horses back the way you want 'em, and something for Billy. - Cora, this is not your fight. - It is my fight! It's my family. Look out that window. If you don't stay and fix the barn, we'll be livin' hand to mouth soon. I've been prayin' for a miracle so there'd be peace between Ballard and me. But nothin' comes back. No answers, no ways to go, nothin'. I'm your miracle. I'm what you prayed for. What sort of woman is she, the attorney general's wife? - She's a fine woman. - And her husband? - I'm sure her husband is fair. - I don't know, Cora. What your askin'... Truth is, I got a terrible fear if you go off chasin' Ballard... I'll never see you again. You're gettin' sassy with your old man, is what I'm hearing. Better watch that. So it's all decided. I'll be back in two weeks. I'll take Woody with me. I'll see the attorney general, and I'll get the lamp oil you always forget. Two weeks is a long time. Nothin' like a little separation to make the heart grow fonder. Also, I'm smarter than you when it comes to politickin'. Or did I say that? Yeah, I think you mentioned that one. You're a miracle, all right. - Take care of my bride, Woody. - You betcha, boss. If I meet a handsome cowboy, I may go right on to Philadelphia. Well, if you do, send Woody back. I need him for the roofin'. Wouldn't be jealous, would ya? Better come back, hurry up, lose my man. Get down off of there, son. Cage, kiss your mother and get off there. Cage, go on, now. Get out of here. Get workin' on that barn. Bye, boys. That's right, folks. Come on in and see it all. Toenail it in before you let go! - Cora, I'm going to the blacksmith. - All right. - I'll come find you. - I'll be here. These are the original documents in the case? Excuse me a moment. Mr. Crawford, you're next! Now, okay, I will take these under consideration for the attorney general. You are Mr. Wakefield, is that correct? You might want to take a seat. We'll get to you as soon as we can. - Look. - You know, any one of these things. He started to go off to the one side when we came up over the last hill. I think we got to go visit an old neighbor of ours. - Mr. Metcalfe, please. - Do you have an appointment? - No, I don't. - All these folks have appointments. You need to write ahead so we can give you a time. Mrs. Lipton, you're next! I come from Rawlins to see Mr. Metcalfe. Could you make an exception in my case? This week is out of the question. He's across town with the statehood people. Judith Metcalfe said anytime I was in Cheyenne to come look her up. Sorry. There's nothin' I can do. My name is Cora Redding, from Rawlins. My husband is Myrl Redding, the horse dealer. - Maybe you know him. - No, ma'am, I surely don't. Well, Mrs. Metcalfe does, and she would want to know that I'm in Cheyenne. So could you please see that she gets this? I'm staying at the Wainwright Hotel. It's important that she get this message. Thank you, Captain. No end of 'em. Yes. Boy, we rubbed that up along the way, didn't we? You okay there, Hoss? And get the hell out of here! Someone get a doctor! She's still breathing. - Call Doc Patterson. - What happened? - She got run over. - Who is she? Her name is Cora Redding, from Rawlins... and she come here to see the attorney general. Well, sir, I am the attorney general. She come here... to give you this. Handsome woman. Crazy bastards out there. It hurts awful, Woody. Oh, I know. I'm sorry I let you down, Cora. I'm so sorry. Don't let me die here. Oh, no. You ain't gonna die. I ain't gonna let you die. We gotta go home. You hang on, and go home. Everything's gonna be okay now. The attorney general got Myrl's petition. This petition doesn't belong here. Send this to Judge Wilkins in Rawlins. Yes, sir. Private! - Yes, sir. - Put that in the pouch to Rawlins. Hey, everybody, Ma's comin'! Hey, yeah! Look at that! Right on time! I swear your mother clocks better than Union Pacific, Cage. What happened to my wife? What happened? I'm so sorry I wasn't there for her. I should never have left her. - It's all right. - I'm so sorry. You weren't lookin' for trouble. "Be praised, my Lord, for those who forgive through Your love. And bear sickness and tribulation. Blessed are those who endure in peace... for they will be crowned by You most high. Be praised, my Lord, for our sister, bodily death... from whom no living thing can escape. Blessed are those whom she finds doing Your holy will... for the second death shall not harm them." Ante up. Nickel ante, Mr. Ballard. Five card draw. Then what happened, Ollie? Woody started it. He said I smelled like pig slop. I stroked him a good one. It would have pleasured me to have been there to see that. You take my advice, you'll steer clear of Redding. Sent his own woman to Cheyenne to beg for him. What kind of man would do a thing like that? Keep buyin' as we been doin'... and next year there'll be nothing but pasture from here to Landers. No way they can stop us, even with statehood. - Quarter to you, Mr. Ballard. - Keep the land rollin' in. That's the ticket. Calm everybody down. That means you, Ollie. You and Slater. Good things are happenin'. We don't need trouble. - Is that a quarter to me or the judge? - I want three. Gimme three. A quarter to you, Judge. Shelby. How are you? Shelby, this is your change. I know you been wantin' to expand. - You want to sell out? - Maybe. After all you put into it. Yeah, I'm interested, Myrl. I'd be a fool not to. But I gotta think about it. You come on me all of a sudden. The whole lot. You seen this, so you know what I'm talkin' about. - I know it's prime, all right. - The whole lot. Gimme a hand. All right, Hattie. - You're serious? - Rayborn's working up the papers now. You been a good neighbor, Shelby. I wanna give you first crack. - You're talkin' the whole spread? - And what's on it. Well, I gotta tell you up front... I don't have a need for all them horses. No, the horses ain't part of the deal. I got plans for the horses. So what we're talkin' is the price of the land. And what's on it. I come up with three dollars an acre. Three dollars an acre? That's a fair price, Myrl. You betcha, that's awful good. As long as you understand, cash on signing. Why are you doin' this, Myrl? I mean, you got water. You got one of the finest tracts of land in Rawlins. I mean, if it's all because of Ballard... hell. That land is your future. There are bigger things than land. I'll help you out. - You want a cup of coffee? - That'd be nice. Welcome. - Hello, Mr. Rayborn. - Cage. - What did he say? - Well... attorney general sent your petition back. I mean, he's awful sorry about Cora and everything... but he had to turn you down. He says it's a local matter, and it's up to Judge Wilkins to decided. That's the law, see, and he's got to obey it. Just like you. What are you tellin' me? Well, Wilkins already ruled, so that's it. I put in a lot of time on this, Myrl. Have you? - How much do I owe you? - Twenty-five. Plus what you already owe. Hi, boys. That's all I got. I'll give you the rest later. I won't be needin' you anymore. I'm awful sorry about what happened to Cora. That's an awful thing to happen. Just awful. Whole town's upset about it. If there's anything I can do, just... I wrote somethin' I want you to read. Tell me what you think. "I, Myrl Redding, by authority inborn in me..." "As a free man living in a free territory... demand that Henry Ballard, within seven days of receiving this note... bring to my stables the horses he took from me... groom and fatten them with your own hands to the condition I left them. And to injuries caused to Billy Redwood who did nothing to you... pay him $50." It is signed Myrl Redding, owner of the horses. Let the law take care of it, Myrl. There's no way Ballard will do what you tell him to do just because you say so. Yes, he will. And if he don't, I got plans to convince him. To hear the particulars, come to my spread tonight, and I'll spell it out. I hold no man responsible for the death of my wife, but me. I let her go... and I gotta live with that the rest of my life. Judge Wilkins. In a town where there is no law a man is obliged to make his own. Isn't that the way it works around here? Wouldn't you say, Judge Wilkins? Seven days. Henry Ballard, come talk to me. I'm delivering a notice of law on you. You got seven days to read it and answer. Seven days, and I'm comin' for you. I should have killed him. Shelby'll deposit the rest of the money in your name in the bank in Casper. If I need any, I'll come to you. - And remember, it's your money. - Why can't I just go with you? I need you to stay here with Mr. And Mrs. Dykes so I don't worry. All I want is to go with you. It's your job now to hold down the fort till I get back. Somebody's got to take care of the spread. Now that's a big responsibility. Do you understand? - Sure. - Cage, do you understand? - But all I want is to help you. - I know. Hell, we all know it. - Ballard's gone too far. - Yes, he has. Puttin' up a toll gate, decidin' who's to pay and who ain't. If he can get away with what he done to Myrl, he can do whatever he wants. It's time we all woke up. I know you're all real busy, so I'll get right to the point. I'm invitin' you to ride with me against Henry Ballard. No. What Ballard did to Billy and your horses sure was bad. Now, I'd like to help. But this ain't my quarrel. You're right, Dewey. It ain't your quarrel. But there'll come a time... and this toll gate is just the start of things... when Ballard decides to box you in some more... maybe take some of your land... or cut you off from water like he did Carey Sartin. Then you'll come and say, "Look here, Myrl. Look what Ballard's doin'. I need your support." And I could say to you, "Dewey, it ain't my quarrel. I run a horse farm. I live over there. Two-hour ride." But until statehood comes along... all we got is Ballard's law. That's right. And there's no future in it. And I did not come 1,500 miles to tolerate that. - I ain't lookin' for a shootout. - Well, neither is Myrl. Overpowering 'em with numbers. That's the idea. Scare 'em into doin' right. Folks like you and me comin' after 'em. - No bloodshed. - What if he runs? Let him. We'll follow until we find him. - How long's it gonna take, Myrl? - Maybe a day, maybe two, maybe longer. I don't care. I'll provide the horses and grub. - As long as it takes. - That takes money, Myrl. My spread's for sale. Shelby and I worked out a deal. Every man jack of you gets $15 a month... for as long as it takes to bring that man in alive and working these stables. Myrl means business! I'm for it. I'm sick of Ballard beatin' us. - I know men who'll ride against him. - Bring 'em along. If you don't want to go, it's okay with me. I'm going after Ballard anyway. And if you don't want to go on principle, then go for money... because I pay cash on the barrel head. He ain't comin'. Who's he gonna come with? Well, he's got Woody, and an injun. If he shows, he goes home in a pine box. Hey! Hold up there! Mr. Ballard, it's Redding, and he's got a whole army with him. He's got a hundred men with him, Mr. Ballard. Get out of here! Go! Get 'em up in the bunkhouse! Tell 'em to get their guns on! Hurry up! Get the hell out of my way! Hey, get back here! Get back here, you sons of bitches! Where you goin'? Get on back there. See? Nothin' here. Come on, son. Get up there. That'll do. - Anything? - Nothin', Myrl. - Slater and Ollie? - They hightailed it. Any man who treats an animal that way... he don't deserve a stable. Wouldn't you say, Billy? Get the other animals out and burn it. Straight on through. There you go. What have you done? That'll do. Myrl, Ballard's keep. Ma'am, where's Ballard? I don't know. 'Cause of what your boss did, my law's now the law. If you hide him or help him in any way, I'll burn you out. Do you understand? Whatever's done, mend it. Where's he goin'? - I don't know. - Don't lie. Maybe headed for Cheyenne. That's a long haul. He's got to stop somewhere, doesn't he? Please don't burn me out. I've got nowhere else to go. Maybe headed for Medicine Bow? Who does he know in Medicine Bow? Tub Weller, his brother-in-law, owns a feed store there. We leave for Medicine Bow tonight. Let's go! Henry Ballard, you in there? - Come out! - Get off my property, Redding. Check inside. We ain't been introduced. How come you know my name? I don't want no trouble. You been hidin' a fugitive. That's a crime according to my law. - Where is he? - Gone. Where did he go? I got nothin' to do with your grudge against Henry. Where and when did he go? Come on. While you're thinkin' about it, Billy, light me some fire. I'll ask you one more time. Where and when did he go? You get the hell off my property, Redding. To back where you come from. You ride with Crow. If I knew where he was, I'd hide him to spite you. Would ya? Burn him. Fire! I'm looking for a man named Henry Ballard. Do you know him? Is there a printer around? I got a job for him. I pay cash. Pardon me, ma'am, miss. - You a printer? - Yes, sir. I do print. This is what I need printed. Two-hundred copies. - How much? - Ten dollars. I'll give you 15. I need it right away. I'll see what I can do. - As big as you can make it. - Yes, sir. That's what I do. Big. Always. As I said before, I'm looking for a man named Henry Ballard... who cheated me out of my horses, injured them and beat up my man. If you hide him or help him in any way, I'll burn you out. I, Myrl Redding, by authority inborn in me... as a free man living in a free territory... demand that Henry Ballard, within seven days of receiving this notice... bring to my stables the horses he took from me. Groom and fatten them with your own hands in my stables. For injuries caused to Billy Redwood who did nothing to you, pay him $50. It is signed Myrl Redding, owner of the horses. He's over at the barber's. Hey! I need a room. Can you move 'em any quicker than that? - All right, men. Let's mount up. - You better leave some men at Redding's. Ballard ain't goin' there. He went to his brother-in-law's house. If Redding finds Henry, he's sure as hell coming back. Maybe, but I ain't splittin' my men. I need all I got if you expect me to get Redding. Let's go, men. Terrible situation, Judge. I tried to control it as best I could. There's just no turnin' him. You know, he tried to pay me for my work. I wouldn't take his money. No? There's a funny smell around here. Governor, I think you should look at this. - "Henry Ballard." - Mm-hmm. Where is he? He was at the Wainwright Hotel. He keeps moving. - Myrl Redding? - He's outside of town somewhere. Clear him out. I can't. I've got a hundred men on escort duty. So go with what you've got. What I've got is ten men, sir. Redding's got 40, 50 guns and Crow. Every drifter in Cheyenne is signing on with him, so I need at least a company. Great. Just what we need. With a statehood delegation coming in from Washington. What's the attorney general doing in all of this? Mr. Metcalfe sent Redding's petition back to Judge Wilkins. And? Well... Wilkins kind of works for Ballard is what it comes down to, sir. Got shares in his association. I hear this is what caused the trouble. Ballard don't sing our song on statehood. I don't care where he stands. He's entitled to protection until the matter's cleared up. Tell Metcalfe I want to see him on Redding's petition. Yes, sir. It's a miss. When do your troops get back? Two, three days. Find Ballard. Tell him we can't guarantee his safety. Tell him he's on his own. Tell him for his own good, he ought to leave Cheyenne. Is there anything you can do to calm things down? About the only way to calm Redding down is to shoot him down. Follow the sheriff. Let me know where he camps. Wake up, Sheriff. Strip him! Now quit, Myrl. You've gone too far. Far enough is when I get satisfaction, Sheriff. - No animal's worth what you're doin'. - In your opinion. Well, you're goin' to jail for torchin' Ballard's spread. As long as he's in there with me. You'll get these back as soon as I find him. Remember me, coward? Remember me? Oh, damn! You stinkin' savage! You all seen what happened. Slater drew first. He was gonna shoot Billy in the back. You all seen it, right, Sheriff? Slater moved, but Billy had the upper hand. Slater drew first! Right? Slater moved first. You all heard the sheriff. Don't forget what he said. Damn it! Ollie, listen to me. You gotta get to Judge Wilkins. Tell him that Redding shot Slater and he burned down Ballard's barn. Tell him to file charges. Go on. Get goin'. I know when the delegation arrives... we will all show them the hospitality and friendliness... that Wyoming people are known for. We are not separate ranchers, farmers and settlers... of the Wyoming territory, but united today... as citizens of the future... great state of Wyoming! Yeah! - Where's Ballard? - Holed up in a hotel. Refuses to leave town. Do I have that correct, Colonel? Yes. I posted two soldiers with him. That's the best I could do. It's just a matter of time before Redding finds him. This has gone too far. Jail him. - Who? - Thanks for your support. - Jail who, Governor? - Ballard. - On what charges? - Any charge you want. Any charge he'll agree to. Disturbing the peace. See if he'll buy it. If he wants protection, jail is the safest place for him. Thank you. Colonel, tell Redding if he quits going after Ballard... the attorney general will reopen his case. I don't know. People are upset. The delegation arrives in two days. I want the streets clear. Amnesty for what Redding's done if he quits going after Ballard. Put it on paper. Colonel, find him and give it to him. This is nonsense. The statehood of Wyoming will not be held up... by a piss fight over two horses and a Crow Indian. Understand me? I want this settled now. - Do you understand? - Governor, let's get a picture. - You know the ladies. - Yes, I do. Smile, everybody! Great. Thank you for comin', everyone. Let's go eat! Billy, come with me. Woody, go on around. We'll catch up later. Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Don't shoot! Daisy. Daisy. I'm sorry. It's gettin' so I don't recognize none of these guys anymore. Yeah. I didn't think it out. I should've known you'd draw fire comin' out of nowhere. It was wrong to kill Slater for what he did to us. I still can't believe Cora's dead, Billy. I keep hopin' a miracle will happen and she'll come back to life. God forgive me for lettin' her go. I'm comin' after you anyway, old man. I'm comin'. What day do you suppose it is? I don't know. Riders comin'! - Governor wants to make a deal. - I'm listening. You lay down your arms, come in peaceably... he'll reopen your case against Ballard. You do this, and we'll drop all charges against you. - Where's Ballard? - He's goin' to jail. I don't want him in jail. I want him workin' in my stables. That's something I can't negotiate. Governor promises a hearing right away. And if I say no? Then I go after you with the army, and you lose. Billy's part of this. I gotta talk it over with him. They say they'll drop the charges if we come in. I don't trust them. That's what they say. Rivers are not to be trusted. Neither are white man's armies. It's a trick. Maybe. You decide for you, and I'll decide for me. Take care, my brother. We'll see each other again. Just not on this road. - Good-bye, little brother. - Good-bye, Billy. Hold it! Stop the work! Take it outside, boys. I got a hearing to run. Hear ye, hear ye! The court of the territory of Wyoming is now in session. The honorable Joe B. Tolliver presiding. Judge, it is a real honor... This is a legal hearing, and you will get your chance to be heard. - Be seated, except Redding and Ballard. - Everybody take your seats. Raise your right hands. Do you swear to tell the truth... the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? - Yes, sir. - Please be seated. - Are all the parties here? - All but Billy Redwood. - Where is Billy Redwood? - He left Cheyenne, Your Honor. - He refused the offer of amnesty. - Murdering bastard! Keep your mouth shut, or I will have you jailed for contempt! I want to get to the bottom of this in two hours or less of my time. Now, Mr. Redding, this is your petition. - Do you wish to change any of it? - Is that the one from my wife? - Yes. - No. - Will you accept cash for the horses? - No. I accept what the words say. Since Billy Redwood has refused amnesty, you may drop him from this petition. - The suit stands the way it's written. - So be it. Mr. Ballard, let's start with you. What's your side of this mess? Well, Your Honor, this troublemaker Redding come on my land... on his way to Casper to sell some horses... and I made a neighborly offer that he could pass, pay me $10. Well, he had a near fit, said he didn't have no $10. Now, still trying to be helpful, I told him... Sir, I can understand you from over there. Uh, if he would just leave two of his animals... when he came back, he could pay me, pick 'em up, it'd be all right. Uh, and he left me two swaybacked old bones. When he did come to get 'em, he said, "These are not my horses." I said, "Of course they are." He cursed me and left. Now, that's all there was to it. You can ask Ollie, 'cause he was there. - Poor old Slater... - Slater ain't part of this hearing. Now, even before we hear Redding's side of the story... I got to tell you I don't believe the part about the two swayback old bones. But that's what they was. Ain't no dealer I know would travel 100 miles to sell a five-dollar nag. - I know horses... - So do I. Now, did you put up a toll gate on your property? - It's my land. - Did Redding know it'd cost him $10. Whether he did or not is nothin' to me. You charge everybody the same $10 to come and go? - You bet. - You're under oath, Mr. Ballard. - Some do and some don't. Is that it? - Well, I am a cattle rancher. Judge Wilkins over in Rawlins just filed two counts of murder... and one count of insurrection against Myrl Redding. Anything you want on your property, including a damn toll gate... Excuse me, gentlemen. Would you take it outside of my courtroom, please? - Sorry, Judge. - Apologies. Thank you. Although putting up a toll gate, to my mind, is a hostile act. And if it happened to me in my travels, you would feel the lash of my tongue. He said the governor doesn't have the power to grant amnesty for murder. What murder? A rancher's wife named Daisy Mathes and one of Ballard's men, Slater. What's relevant here is the law. I judge cases on law. Law is the king with me, 'cause if it wasn't, this territory... even if it becomes a state, wouldn't be fit for a prairie dog. Now, Redding, what's your story? He's lying. Hold it! Order in this courtroom! Please take your seats! Continue. Wilkins claims Redding shot them both and burned down Ballard's barn. - This happened before the agreement. - Before the amnesty? Goddamn, we didn't know anything about any shootings. - Does the governor know about this? - I thought I should tell you first. We need to figure out how best to take this to the governor. "Come in peaceably, and all charges will be dropped." Who wrote this? You? No, sir. I did, sir. You did? What the hell is he doing writing a legal document? That's the way it just worked out, sir. He doesn't know the first damn thing about law, much less amnesty! Francis, I've been attending the statehood delegation. You are the attorney general... and you allowed this... him... to write an amnesty agreement! Sir, there was no one else. If I didn't do it, it would not gonna get done. Do you realize the position you've put me in, Hoyt? I am on public record forgiving murder. We were unaware of that at the time, sir. When did these murders happen? As near as we can figure, sir, a couple of days before Redding's amnesty. So, we covered him. - Is that what you're saying? - Well, that's a legal question. If a legal mind had prepared the amnesty, we wouldn't be in a legal mess. You're right, sir. This is all your fault, Hoyt. Get Judge Tolliver. - Well, he's in court, sir. - I wouldn't advise bother him now. Get him anyway! Now! Yes, sir. Them horses were promised to me. I went to Casper to pick 'em up... but was told that Myrl didn't bring 'em. That surprised me. Myrl don't do business that way. Myrl gives his word, and that's it. What, in your judgment, was the value of these horses? They was mint stallions, Your Honor. I was willing to pay $200 each for 'em. You ever seen 'em before? Yeah, when they was yearlings. You're dismissed. Thank you, Your Honor. Anyone else have an opinion in this matter? Anyone? All right, Mr. Redding, you will have a guard with you... at all times until this case is over. - I don't need a guard. - There's angry people all over Cheyenne. You can either have a guard, or you can share a cell with Mr. Ballard. I'll take the guard. Hearing is adjourned. That's everything. You're all set. Burn him out! You all, this is over two horses! Two horses, and I think three, maybe four people dead. Oh, this is madness. Excuse me. This man Redding is threatening to burn down the Wainwright Hotel. This place is not ready to be a state. I can tell you that right now. Well, we can talk all night long, but the people want something done. Something will be done, Conrad, but it's gotta be according to the law. The question is, can Redding's amnesty be revoked? You signed an executive agreement forgiving a man for something he did... and you put a date on it. I gave my word. I'll honor it. But if Redding violates the terms of his amnesty... you can revoke it and try him for murder. But you've got to do it legal. If he doesn't violate his amnesty, you've got a problem. You've got to prove in court what you knew when it was granted. In the meantime, gentlemen, if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go pee. I think it's time for me to retire, Francis. Thank you. Good evening, Hoyt, Colonel. Small thing, if you don't mind. Good night, gentlemen. Good night, Conrad. - Ballard wants to see you. - No, not with the trial coming up. He feels wronged, sir. He does own a lot of land. Just a word, sir. He ain't gonna plead his case. Just a moment. No more, Governor. - Show him in. - Yes, sir. Mr. Ballard, the governor will see you now. Sir, this is Henry Ballard. What the hell is goin' on here? You got a murderer runnin' loose in Cheyenne free as a jaybird. I ain't done nothin', and I'm locked away in jail. Now, I'm one of the biggest cattlemen in this territory. I ain't gettin' no respect. I ain't gettin' no protection. Now, you're talkin' about statehood... for this tinhorn shanty, ain't-worth-a-shit city. To hell with that! Where's my protection? Where is the army? We don't have an army. - What? - The army we have... is on escort duty protecting the folks from Washington... coming here to take this tinhorn shanty... ain't-worth-a-shit city... and turn it into the capitol of the State of Wyoming. Under the circumstances... you can hightail it out of town and take your chances on the road... which would suit me fine... or you can cool your ass in jail until things blow over. Either way, get! Yeah. Well, that wraps up a good, productive day. He can't just go in somebody's house and burn down their barn! He can't just ride up and shoot somebody's wife! Where's the army? That's what I wanna know. He's just goin' around... He needs to be stopped. Billy wants to know how the trial's going. Judge ain't decided yet. How is it for you? It's bad for us. If we get caught, they'll hang us. Billy wants to know if you'll join us. I'm keepin' after Ballard. I better spell it out for him. Take this to him. Good luck, friend. Judge, how does this affect the amnesty? "I don't know how it will go with me, but if I lose... God willing I have the strength to continue my fight. And with your help and friendship, I will." If Redding wrote this, it means he intends to break the agreement... and continue his fight with Ballard. You can revoke the amnesty. I say we arrest him and announce it to the crowd. That'll be the end of it. There's a trial coming up, Mr. Metcalfe, in which you... as chief legal officer of this territory will have to consider all the facts... including murder and armed insurrection, and not just part of it. That will be the end of it. Sir, somebody owes you an apology. I never quit, old man. Remember that. You'll find out, boy. Order! Order! Let's get on with this. The injun moved first. I seen it with my two eyes. Billy stalked Slater with a knife while Slater was on the ground. Redding, watching all the time, he didn't say a word. Didn't say, "Hold on, Billy Redwood. What are you gonna do? What are you up to?" See, Redding knew that it was Slater who beat up the Indian. It was Slater who fought with Woody on the day that Redding's wife was killed. So when Slater moved to defend himself, Myrl shot him dead. It was premeditated murder. Billy come riding up all of a sudden. The injun out front. I winged the Crow pretty good... and then for no reason, Redding started firing. And then Daisy... She... God have mercy on her. She... She heard the shootin', and then... she came runnin' out to protect me. And then that man... that man shot her. I didn't know nothin' about a quarrel. All I know is, Daisy and me had nothin' to do with it. Now she's gone. I'm sorry for your wife, but you're a liar. Mr. Redding, I have here in my hand a letter which may seem familiar to you. Did you write this letter to Billy Redwood? Yes, I did. Would you do me the favor, please, of reading it aloud to the jury? If you like. "Dear Billy, I'm sorry I got you into this. It doesn't look good for you. The judge says you have no claim because you didn't show up. I don't know how it will go with me, but if I lose... God willing I have the strength to continue my fight... and with your help and friendship, I will." "With your help and friendship, I will." Will what? Continue to burn people's barns and property? Continue to murder innocent people? Is that what you're saying? No, that's not what I mean. I said I will continue the fight against Ballard, and I will. But I didn't say how. And I never said I done everything right. And I take responsibility for that. But Grady is lying when he says I killed his wife... and the sheriff is lying about how I killed Slater. I didn't go looking to kill anybody. It's justice I'm lookin' for, and it's justice I'll get. I'll track it as long as I'm breathing, and even if it costs me my life. Hear ye, hear ye! The court of the territory of Wyoming is now in session. The honorable Joe B. Tolliver presiding. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict? We have, Your Honor. Thank you, Miss Hayden. Myrl Redding, please rise. Mr. Foreman. On the charge of killing Slater Morrison... we find the defendant, Myrl Redding, not guilty. On the charge of two counts of armed insurrection... in the killing of Daisy Mathes... we find the defendant, Myrl Redding, guilty as charged. Order. Thank you, Mr. Foreman. Myrl Redding, Henry Ballard, please approach the bench. We got him! I told you we'd get him. How do you like this justice, boy? Wipe that smile off your face, Mr. Ballard. This is serious business. You first, Mr. Ballard. The petition of grievance against you... by Mr. Redding has been upheld. You are to, with your own hands... restore the health and good condition of the two horses... left in your care by Myrl Redding. Further, in your testimony to this court... you lied when you described the condition of the horses... as swaybacked old bones. Nothing could be further from the truth as testified... by those who knew the value of the horses. Lying under oath is a serious offense. I therefore sentence you to two years in jail for perjury... three months of which will be spent working in Myrl Redding's stables. - Get your hands off me! - Order! Myrl Redding... you've been found guilty of armed insurrection and murder. Do you have anything to say before this court passes judgment upon you? I took the law into my own hands. I did it because there was none in Rawlins. I wrote my own law, but I didn't create it. I used what was there all along... in my mind. That law was there before we were born. I am sorry for Daisy Mathes. When we rode off, we never knew she'd been shot. For my part in it, I beg her husband's forgiveness. I'm a horse trader, Your Honor. All I was doing was taking my horses to market. That's it. You wanted justice. You got justice comin' to you. - Ready. - The horses misused by Henry Ballard... will be restored to their former condition and to your satisfaction. - Following that... - Aim. It is the sentence of this court that you be taken to a place of execution... and hanged by the neck until you are dead. Fire! And may God have mercy on your soul. - Court is adjourned. - Die, you son of a bitch! He's comin', son. Real good. Can I just take a moment with my son? I guess. Hey, come on, now. You're the man of the house. Come on. Your mother and I'll always be with you. You'll just have to make it on your own. Why are they doing this to you, Pa? Two people died, me chasin' Ballard. Somebody's gotta pay. But why? You didn't kill nobody. I killed Slater, all right, but I didn't kill Daisy. It's important to me that you know I didn't. Her husband must've shot her by mistake. But I caused it. Did you see the horses? - How do they look? - Great. - Promise me something, son. - Sure, Pa. Don't ever sell 'em. I'll never sell 'em. Never. They're the best two you and Billy ever raised. A lot of pride in those stallions. Come from a great line. You can build on 'em. So, how much money you got in the bank? Maybe $200. Well, you've got the rest of the money Shelby owes. He's a good man. You can trust him. He'll take good care of you. Shelby says that there's... we could bust out. There's a lot of folks in town, and they're talkin' about... No. It's time to put an end to this. There's still time. We could do it together. Cage, they'd find me sooner or later. I don't want any more killing in my name. Do you understand? Now listen to me. Somebody steps on your rights, go after him. Never give up. Never. Just be smarter than I was. All right? Come on. Let's go look at the horses. Mr. Redding, here are your horses. Well, sir? These are my horses. Beautiful animals, wouldn't you say, Judge? You want 'em? You got 'em! I hope you burn in hell, you son of a bitch! - You got nothin' from me! - You did what I said you'd do. You got nothin'! Nothing! That's all you got! Want a cigar? Well, I worry about you and me, Judge Wilkins. I swear to God I do. 'Cause if this country gets ruined... it'll be ruined by people like you and me. This is a territory of unimportant people. Most folks around here can't even write their name. You and me, we're the important people. Trouble is, there's not enough of us important people to go around. We're spread thin, so sometimes... important things get ignored or don't get said. Like take care of the little fellow. See to it that he don't get ignored or cheated or insulted. Make sure that his dignity does not get trampled on. Now, you're feelin' bad right now, and by God you ought to... seein' as what just happened to a decent man. Myrl Redding did not fail the law. The law failed Myrl. Just so you'll know who's behind it, this is a copy... of a letter that I wrote to the governor asking that a committee be called... to evaluate your fitness as a sitting judge. It is my earnest hope and desire that that committee finds you wanting... and that articles of impeachment be drawn to remove you from the bench. I'm doing this out in the open. Everything's on the table, up and up... so you'll know who the son of a bitch is who's gunning for your ass. It's me, the honorable Joe B. Tolliver. We're closed, Judge, out of respect for the condemned man. For you, Judge, I'm willing to make an exception. Ten bucks a shot, if you get a permit. Gotta have a permit, Judge. Good-bye, Cage. Be strong, as I know you are. I love you. I love you, Pa. Cage, come here. Take care of my son. I know you will. Don't wanna quit. I'm sorry for the pain I caused... but so help me God, I could not have done otherwise. In my heart, I am just. Let's do it. Come on, Cage. "You created the moon to count months. The sun knows when it must set. The truth is subtle, His law complete... His justice absolute. Let my words be rooted in honesty... and my thoughts be lost in Your light, unnameable God.
