Children, children. Shut that noise. Stop that noise I say. Billy goat! Go back to the zoo! Go away. I shall report you to the police. You are disturbing the lecture. Prefects must observe these fundamental rules of deportment. Now sometimes these rules may seem ridiculous. But. They keep us on our toes to see to it .. That our own personal conduct is at all times free from reproach. Now, as students of political science. You have to remember only one thing about the subject of protocol. Diplomatic etiquette. Diplomatic etiquette is much like ordinary personal etiquette. And is based upon courtesy .. and .. Thoughtfulness. Gentility. If you want to stay in the Foreign Office. You are expected to keep your life free of any taint of scandal. Remember, as Frenchmen. You have a reputation. And if you live up to it. You will be in trouble. We are grateful to Monsieur Talbot. For taking time off from his duties in the Foreign Office. To come here to address us on statecraft. And now you may ask questions of Monsieur Talbot. Well? Monsieur. What is the difference between a note between countries and a memorandum? Suppose your neighbour's baby were keeping you awake at night. You would first send your neighbour a memorandum saying how unhappy you were. If that got no results you would then send him a note. Threatening to call the police unless he sound-proofed the baby. Monsieur. Monsieur mentioned that the private life of a diplomat must be above reproach. Does that mean that he must be beyond certain normal instincts? If .. If the following of those instincts were opposed to the good of his country .. The diplomat would, I think, be expected to ignore them. Monsieur? But suppose for example that .. He were to be attracted by a woman he couldn't resist. Well .. He would probably be very brave and put duty before pleasure. I thought the brave deserved the fair. Unfortunately .. Diplomats very seldom get what they deserve. Now, Monsieur. Well? Forgive me, Monsieur. But I had to ask you one more question. If a girl fell in .. I mean .. If a girl were to be attracted by a nice young diplomat .. And wanted to go home with him. Would the Foreign Office approve? Home. But .. will the Foreign Office approve? I will ask them in the morning. Tell me about yourself mademoiselle. Or .. Is it Madame? Madame. Widow? No. Divorced? No. Well .. The Foreign Office makes such beautiful rules to protect its diplomats. Does it do nothing for the women who fall in love with them? No. You felt you were pretty clever throwing all those questions at me, didn't you. How did you get in there anyway? I just made a face like a student and walked straight in. You made me feel like a vaudeville comedian with a stooge in the audience. But darling, I am your stooge. That is what a wife is for. That is your opinion. Come, darling. You will love the man who lives here. Tall. Brilliant. Dashing. Darling, close your eyes. - What? Close your eyes, and no peeking. Promise? - I promise. Careful. Two steps. One. Two. Now. Darling, your birthday. But 91 candles? Huh? No, of course not. Let's see. Now, no, no. Don't tell me. 91 candles? 91 days. We've been married three months. - And you have forgotten. Oh, my darling. Excuse me. Yes, Pierre? - For Madame. This came for you. - For me? Oh! With the compliments of the groom. Darling. And this came for you, Monsieur. It's perfectly beautiful. Well. Did you pick it out yourself? Oh David. Do you know it makes me feel just like a bride. Darling, you will always be a bride. David. When does a bride become a wife? David? What is in the letter? What's in the letter? "Dear, Jean." Well, that is not for you. - It is addressed to me. "Allow an old friend to congratulate you .." "On your noble career. Accept my good wishes for a happy life." "You are now able to pay me that old debt of one million .. francs." One million francs? - Now read the rest of it. "May I suggest that you deliver the money to the old deserted farm .." "Chantilly road. Throw it over the .." "Boarded-up gate." "I am sure you will understand the reason for these exotic instructions." "And the reason why this letter must remain unsigned." But what does it mean? - I have no idea. What are you going to do? There is only one thing to do. David, I am frightened. Carlos Le Duc. You are brought to the bar of justice and charged by the state with extortion. You are accused of writing an anonymous letter to David Talbot. In which you ask for repayment of a debt to the amount of one million francs. Monsieur Le President. The defense will prove that the letter written by my client. Was a straightforward request for monies owed him. And not an instrument of extortion. The defense will also prove I presume .. That creditors these days request that debts be paid by .. Throwing the money over a wall in a lonely park? My creditors are not so imaginative. Your creditors might be if you were living under an assumed name. And they were considerate enough. To help you keep your deception a secret. The court wishes to know to whom do you refer as living under an assumed name. If the court will permit my client to tell his story. My reference will become clear. Very well. He may tell his story. I first met this gentleman. David Talbot in 1919 Right after the war. But in those days his name wasn't Talbot. Then he was known as Jean Pelletier. He had a reputation as petty criminal. With a list of crimes charged against him as long as a bell rope. Well, perhaps not quite as long as a bell rope but quite an extensive list. I claim the court's indulgence. But what has Pelletier's record to do with the charges against this defendant? It seems quite clear that if a previous relationship existed between .. The defendant and Monsieur Talbot, whatever his name may have been. There is a possibility that the debt actually existed. Proceed. - One talent, he had. A talent for escape. He was never caught by the police. It was in 1922. Later on, that he came to owe me a million francs. It was a decent debt. Nothing dark about it. What were the circumstances of the debt? I regret I am not at liberty to give further details. Perhaps Monsieur Talbot will explain? I cannot. Continue. Years passed and I never heard of Jean Pelletier. Then one day a month or so ago .. I saw his picture in the paper. It announced his marriage to Lucienne de Coville. I realized from the newspaper that Jean had changed his name. But whatever his little game, I had no wish to spoil it. I only wanted my million francs. And I wrote and asked for it. The answer I got. Was a big knife in the back. If, as Le Duc has testified, Monsieur Talbot is in reality Jean Pelletier. Then one of the greatest hoaxes in the history of France .. Has been perpetrated upon the government and the people. What started out to be an unimportant trial of an extortionist. Now assumes the proportions of a celebrated cased. Particularly as Mr Talbot is rumoured to be our next ambassador to Brazil. Please my friends, excuse me. Will you please let me through. Quite a crowd, isn't it. Just a moment, my friend. There are no seats left. But I am a witness, Monsieur. Sorry, go ahead. - Charming. Thank you. A witness. - One moment, Monsieur. May I see your summons please? Most certainly. I have it right here. I had it right there. I really should carry a strongbox. Yes, I am sure you are. But Monsieur, I am telling you. I am a witness. A very important witness. Dr Andre Tessier. Now, clear the hall. Go back behind the rope. Is Andre Tessier here? - Yes, here. Come, come. I am so sorry, Monsieur. - Thank you. Dr Tessier. Where is Dr Tessier? - Here I am. Exciting, isn't it David? Oh my dear, you look so lovely. Dr Tessier. I am wanted. I love that old man. Do you swear to speak without fear, to say the truth and nothing but the truth? I do. I don't hate anybody. Dr Tessier. According to the court records you first met David Talbot in 1922. I first met Monsieur Talbot when he was brought to my hospital at Avignon. That was a few days after the wreck of the Paris/Marseilles Express. That was a great disaster when a train hit an open switch .. Yes, yes. I know. We are familiar with the details, Monsieur. Well, I examined him. And I diagnosed his injuries as a comminuted cranial fracture. With an attendance of dual haemorrhage which had become thrombosed. Will the learned doctor be kind enough to explain these scientific terms. Just what do they mean? For our information, Monsieur. They mean that his head had been cracked open. Like a ripe watermelon. You know. You are a psychoanalyst, doctor? I am a physician, Monsieur. Specialising in mental diseases and nervous disorders. It is true I sometimes use psychoanalysis. But sometimes I also use castor oil. No, no. I'm not a psychoanalyst. I am a doctor who deals with the brain. My office is at 41 Rue De Torrance. Continue, doctor. Continue. David was very strong and in a few days recovered consciousness. But, to my dismay. I discovered that the damage to the brain. Was greater than I thought. There was complete amnesia. He knew nothing of his life up to the moment that he awoke. I never thought I'd be going through this again. He knows what he is doing. How did you know that the patient brought to you was David Talbot? He was identified. - By whom? By the captain of the freighter who brought him from Martinique. Quite right, Quite right. Captain Maurice Durrant. He died a year later in a wreck of Madagascar. Only one man identified the patient, doctor? David had never been in France before. There could be no-one else. And that man is dead. Please continue, doctor. Under careful and prolonged treatment .. David became normal in every respect. Except one. Memory. He is still cut off by a veil of blackness from that time of his life .. Prior to 1922. Go on. Well, there is little more to tell except. That during these years .. I became a friend as well as his physician. I know his soul as well as his brain and to say .. That David Talbot is a criminal is rubbish. Thank you. Monsieur Le President. May I request that you call Dr Dubroc to the stand. Dr Dubroc. Pompous Dubroc. I do. Will you define amnesia for the court. Amnesia. Is a functional or organic embarrassment of the brain .. Which renders impotent the ability of the memory .. To retain sensory impressions previously acquired. In other worlds, it is loss of memory. I suppose so. As a general rule how long does amnesia last? The cases of retrograde amnesia. Resulting from physical injury. Clear up in most instances within a few weeks, a few months at most. Now, is there such a thing as .. Pretended amnesia? Indeed there is. Actually, most cases of amnesia are either pretended or self-induced. More rubbish. Dr Tessier. I regret this interruption. But I wonder if it will be possible for me to ask my colleague a question? You make take the stand with Dr Dubroc, Dr Tessier. I would like to thank Dr Dubroc for his definition of amnesia. In as much as I have sought a definition for it during these many, many years. However in defining amnesia, he used the word "memory". Which brings me to my question. I wonder if Dr Dubroc would define "memory". Why, memory is the function of the brain which enables past experiences .. To be retained or recalled to consciousness. Ah, yes. Very good. Very good. Now just one more question, Dr Dubroc. What is the nature of that function that makes a memory possible? The function is that .. The impression is registered on the brain so that .. no. The .. The experience is retained. This is ridiculous. No-one knows how the memory functions. That is an absurd question. I mean no offence, Dr Dubroc. But if we don't know what memory is .. And amnesia is a condition when memory doesn't work. Well, I wonder if we know what amnesia is. Well, perhaps Dr Tessier would give his definition of amnesia. Well, that is a fair question. It is a very good question. One that exposes my ignorance. I will be very frank. I have not the slightest idea as to the exact nature of amnesia. Not the faintest. There are no rules. No precedents. There are never two cases that are the same. What conclusion do you think the court could draw from this discussion, doctor? That there are no conclusions. Do you agree with the witness, Dr Dubroc? Perfectly, Monsieur Le President. I think Dr Tessier has demonstrated conclusively. That no case of amnesia can be proven genuine. "But Dr Tessier's testimony was totally shattered by Dr Dubroc's statement .." "That no case of amnesia can be proven genuine." "From this point on in the opinion of your commentator .." "The guilt or innocence of the prisoner Le Duc .." "Will be secondary, compared to solving the true identity of David Talbot." "Personally, I think the people of France .." "Are entitled to know the background and character of their servants." "Who aspire to high places." "Perhaps we'll learn things from Talbot when he takes the stand this afternoon." Monsieur Talbot. You just told the court that the first time you ever saw the prisoner Le Duc. Was at the preliminary hearing. - Yes, Monsieur. Then what is your explanation of the debt to which the prisoner refers? I have none. I can only say it is the most fantastic piece of fiction I've ever heard. Thank you. Any questions? Monsieur Talbot, can you tell us where you were .. On the night of March 27th 1922? Of course. I was on the Marseilles/Paris Express. And how long had you been in Marseilles before boarding the train? Two days. I arrived from Martinique on the 25th. How do you know? How do I know? You heard Dr Tessier testify that the Captain of the freighter identified me. Monsieur Talbot, I also heard Dr Tessier testify .. That there is a veil between you and all that happened prior to March 27th 1922. That's correct. Then how, may I ask, can you possibly remember having been in Marseilles? Well, I .. I don't remember. I was told. You were told? Then will you be kind enough to explain to the court .. If you can remember nothing prior to the accident .. How can you remember that you do not owe one million francs to Carlos Le Duc? What was the point of the defense counsel's statement? Only this. That we will prove that Jean Pelletier was also on that train. That David Talbot perished in the wreck. And that the man brought to Dr Tessier .. Was not David Talbot. But Jean Pelletier. Monsieur Talbot. Since what Dr Tessier has referred to as your re-education. Have you made any effort to trace your origin or to forge links with your past? Monsieur Le President. I have made every effort. That I was aboard Captain Durrant's ship has been well established. He said I came aboard at Fort-de-France, Martinique. Three years ago I went back there. I .. I found nothing on the island that I could recognize. And you found no relatives or friends who knew you before your accident? None. The name of Talbot was unknown on Martinique. It must be very disturbing to know nothing of your past. Well. Not really. Not when one's present is so very full. Monsieur Talbot, what are your duties at the Foreign Office? The gathering and correlating of information from our agents abroad. Are government funds allocated for that purpose? - Yes. Where those funds are kept? In my office, largely. Would you be betraying a government confidence .. In telling the court the extent of those funds? Well, it varies from 500,000 to as much as 5 million francs. Is it conceivable that a bump on the head will so change a man's character .. That a petty thief could become a man to whom the government of France .. Would entrust the custody of 5 million francs? I ask you, is it conceivable? One question, Monsieur Talbot. Are you the one who decides how much is to be paid and to whom? Yes. And am I correct in assuming .. That because of the very nature of these payments .. The transactions are extremely confidential? That no .. no receipts are signed? No vouchers proving payment exchanged? Correct. Monsieur Le President. I am sorry. But I cannot accept the argument .. That the mere fact that the witness occupies a position of trust. Is any proof of his integrity. Many embezzlers of funds have occupied positions of trust for years. Before committing their defalcations. One moment, please. Monsieur Le President. I have been summoned to this court as a witness for the state. But the defendant's attorney is treating me as if I were the prisoner. I must demand that he confines his examination to the real issue. Or that I be formally indicted. And given an opportunity to defend myself. Your point is well made, Monsieur. The court will give it all due consideration. Next witness, please. Madame Lucienne Talbot. Do you swear to speak without fear, to say the truth and nothing but the truth? I do. Madame Talbot, when did you first meet your husband? Three years ago at the home of the Foreign Minister, Monsieur Deval. At that time were you aware that Monsieur Talbot was a victim of amnesia? Of course. It was no secret. And you have never had any reason to doubt your husband's identity? Why should I doubt his identity? He is my husband. I am proud to be his wife. Madame. Have you any positive proof that your husband actually is David Talbot? Is this a new custom? That wives must make their husbands present proof of their identity? Of course not. But I hope the reason for her confidence isn't just the faith of a woman in love. Do you know a better reason, Monsieur? Thank you, Madame. That will be all. Next witness please. Mademoiselle Michelle Allaine. Was it alright? That defense attorney? Ha! I thought the medical schools turned out all the idiots. Do you swear to speak without fear, to say the truth and nothing but the truth? I swear it. Your name? - Michelle Allaine. Occupation? I am a singer at the Sirene Club. Do you know or did you know a man by the name Jean Pelletier? Yes. Where did you meet him? At the races. - What was he doing? Gambling on the races. What else? You were in love with him? Yes. Mademoiselle. When did you last see Jean Pelletier? On the night of March 27th 1922. Where? At the railway station at Marseilles. What was he doing? He was boarding the Marseilles/Paris Express. And you never saw him again? No. Do you recognize that man, Mademoiselle? No. Monsieur Le President in order to make the evidence conclusive .. Couldn't Monsieur Talbot come closer to the witness? I'm sure the witness can see Mr Talbot perfectly well from where she stands. Madame. Mademoiselle Allaine, the truth! He is Pelletier, isn't he? Yes. I have never seen this woman before in my life. The court must decide that, Monsieur. Please sit down. Mademoiselle, can you tell us anything about Pelletier that might identify him? A scar .. a birthmark? Some individual habit. No. No, nothing. Nothing perhaps peculiar .. About his hands? No. Yes. There was something. He always wrote with his left hand. Monsieur Talbot, with which hand do you write? Why .. with the left. Just a moment, please. There is a mistake. I must speak. Dr Tessier, this is the second time you have violated the order of this court. Now, what sort of evidence is this? A left hand. Of course David writes with his left hand. When he was brought to me, his right hand was crushed. Paralysed for three years. He had no use of it. I taught him Monsieur Le President to write with his left hand. Thank you, doctor. Your information will weighed along with the other evidence. Thank you. Call Henri Sarrou. Henri Sarrou. Mademoiselle, will you step down from the stand please. Thank you. Do you swear to speak without fear, to say the truth and nothing but the truth? I swear. In this note you say .. "Monsieur Le President, I have vital information bearing upon this case." "And I ask permission to present the evidence." "Documentary evidence pertaining to it." That is true, Monsieur Le President. - Your name? Henri Sarrou. - Occupation? Wine salesman. - Give the testimony. I have just arrived from Africa, a few weeks ago. On reading the papers about this case I ran across the name of Jean Pelletier. Immediately I felt it my duty to testify. For many years I've represented my firm in North Africa. Four years ago I became ill. And was brought to the hospital in Sidi Bel Abb?s. In the bed next to me .. Lay a man dying of fever. I felt sorry for the poor fellow and talked with him. I gained his confidence and he told me his name and the story of his life. It was a pathetic story. Bad friends. A woman. Thievery. The usual road downhill. Two nights later he died. But you refer to documentary evidence. I did. I have these papers here which the dying man gave to me. His name was .. Jean Pelletier. Darling. - Yes? [ Portuguese language ] Thank you. But what does it mean? Why, that is Portuguese. It means you are lovely, you are beautiful, you're exquisite. You give me vertigo and I adore you. That's a rough translation, of course. - Well, not so very rough. Monsieur Talbot. A gentleman has just arrived, Madame. Well, Monsieur Sarrou. How nice. - Madame. I am very happy to see you, Monsieur. You are having guests. Forgive my bad manners calling at an awkward moment. At least, you must have a drink with us. Well .. - Please do. I can't impose on you like that. - No imposition. Come along. Victor. We tried to look you up but you're not in the phone book. I wish you had found me, Madame. Paris is the wrong city in which to be alone. It is indeed. - Thank you. We are deeply indebted to you, Monsieur. I wish there was some way we could express our gratitude. No, really. Monsieur. Madame. To your happiness. Madame and Monsieur Martin. You will excuse me. - Madame. Well, will you be remaining in Paris or will you be returning to Africa? I certainly admire your nerve. You double-crossing swine. Goodnight, Monsieur. Goodnight, Madame. - Goodnight. Now by rights, I should tell David. - Oh, please let me. Alright. Everyone changes partners at this point. Oh. Thank you. David, guess what? - What, darling? Deval talked to the Premier. It looks almost certain that you will get the Brazilian embassy. Isn't it wonderful? But David .. aren't you happy? - Darling .. Pardon me, David. But you can't monopolize your own wife all evening. I should have taken lessons. I only play be ear. Well, what is it? What's your game? It's no game. - Why have you come here? Oh .. Possibly because I forgot my cigarette case. What is it you want? I want one million francs. From me? Why should I give you one million francs? Because you are a man with such a delicate past. That to talk about it would cause you great embarrassment. Get out of my house. - Wait a minute! I have a story to tell you, old friend. I'd like to tell it to you personally. But if you prefer share it with your guests .. You know, that was a wonderful moment in court. When the defense attorney asked you: "Monsieur Talbot". "Where were you on the night of March 27th 1922?" What would you have answered if he'd said: "Where were you on that morning?" That would be a difficult question for a man with a memory to answer. Oh yes, of course. I forgot. You've lost your memory haven't you. Please forgive me. Well, I haven't lost mine. I remember where I was that morning. I was in Marseilles with my friend Jean Pelletier. It was a cold morning, that March 27th. I remember the old messenger wore earmuffs. As he stepped out of the bank carrying a rather large attach? case. He dived into a taxi and ordered the driver to the Credit Lyonnais Bank. And I also remember that the driver turned up a crooked little street. Where, for no reason at all. The motor stopped. Suddenly, the old messenger had visitors. Doors on either side of him opened and two men stepped in. Politely, they ordered him to hand over the attach? case. But the old man was brave. He decided to fight and lashed out like a tiger. So one of the men drew his gun. And shot the old man squarely between the eyes. Just here. The messenger fell to the floor of the taxi. He was very .. Very dead. But of course, you don't remember that. By the time the crowd gathered. The two men had gone. And so had the attach? case. Which contained two million francs. And the taxi driver who called hardly speak French. He was a Russian refugee, you know. It was before the time that he called himself Le Duc. When the police questioned him .. Well, he .. Had a slight attack of amnesia. You know. And couldn't remember that one of the men was myself .. And the other .. the man with the gun .. Was you. You still don't remember? You don't remember the burn on your finger from the flashback of the gun? Come now, Jean. You testified at the trial. That you took a train that night to Paris. But you didn't testify you were to go on to Holland .. To convert the money into foreign currency. We were to meet you in Rotterdam. But we never saw you again. You skipped, my friend. With our share: one million francs. And now we are going to get our money. Get out. So you are going to bluff your way out of this? Darling, is ..? It's my fault, Madame. I came back for something I had forgotten. My cigarette case. Please excuse me. I apologize again for intruding. Goodnight. Please don't bother. I'll find my own way out. Well .. Well. How odd, isn't it .. That he should come back for his cigarette case. He knew we had guests. - Yes, he .. He is rather strange. Perhaps he is lonely. - No, no. It's something else. Lucienne. Our dance is almost over. Come, come. I am so sorry. I will be with you in just a moment. Nobody will miss you. Get me the Prefecture of Police please. Hello. I .. I am sorry. That was a mistake. Well, I don't know. David. Yes, Monsieur? I am a little disappointed in this South America report. What's the matter with it? - I don't think you handled it too well. I did the best I could, Monsieur. Personally, I thought it was a very excellent job. David, you're not yourself this morning. Sorry, Monsieur. Perhaps I had better have another go at it. David. My boy, ambassadors don't have nerves. Yes, I know. I am counting on you to do big things, David. Don't disappoint me now. Relax. Take yourself in hand. Thank you. [ Buzzer ] Yes? "Mademoiselle Allaine to see you, Monsieur." Who? "Mademoiselle Allaine." Show her in. Mademoiselle Allaine. Come in. Jean, darling. Can you ever forgive me? For what? - For what I did at the trial. I lost my head. I may have done you great harm. You might indeed. I'm not made of stone. You look straight into my eyes as though I were a stranger. You .. You didn't want to hurt me? Of course not. I'd do anything in the world rather than hurt you. Why, Madame? Madame? Jean, you are going to the top. You are married. The world is spinning like you want it to. I can understand you not wanting to remember but .. I have no reason to want to forget. What is it you want? I don't want anything, Jean. I came here only to warn you about Sarrou. Oh, Sarrou. Yes. You know what he is, Jean. He is out to ruin you. Sarrou? Well, what would you advise my doing? You have influence. Get him out of the way. Anything. But whatever you do, don't pay him. It will only be the beginning. He'll bleed you white. Thank you. I am very grateful. When you go back to Sarrou. You may tell him that he will never get anything from me. When I go back? Jean, what are you saying? And tell him also. That if either of you so much as calls me on the telephone. I'll turn you both over to the police. Sarrou was right. You have changed. You're cold and hard and selfish. Afraid you will have to share with old friends. Shall I call the police now? Shall I call your elegant wife and tell her all I know about her fine husband? Don't worry. I'll tell my wife every lying, blackmailing thing you've said. Blackmail? Before Sarrou gets through you will wish you were dead. Does that look like blackmail? Go on, look at it. Where did you get that? Where did I get that. Santa Clause gave it to me for Christmas. Wait for me. Madame Allaine. Good evening. How do you do, Madame Talbot. I hope you remember me. Why yes, I remember you. Monsieur. - Evening. May I sit down? Please do. - Thank you. I suppose you are wondering why I came. Well I am rather surprised. Well you see, I felt it only fair to you and to myself. To justify what I did at the trial. You see .. This locket is always coming loose. I must have it fixed. I'm terribly afraid of losing it. Have you ever seen one quite like it? It is very lovely. - May I have .. I've had it for years. Very charming. Yes. Isn't it. You were speaking of the trial, Madame. Oh yes. I wanted you to know the truth. As I explained to Monsieur in his office this afternoon, I .. Oh, but perhaps you have already told Madame? No. I just go home. Oh. Well. Would you care to tell her now yourself. Or shall I? Madame came to explain. She made a very human mistake. It's happened to you, dear. You are walking along the street. And suddenly a face appears. And for a moment you think it is someone you know. Yes. - Well .. In court, when Madame saw me it was just such a moment. A case of mistaken identity. I imagined at the time it was something like that. Yes. It's been terribly on my conscience all these weeks. And I felt that I owed you a personal apology. That's very kind. Well I must go now but perhaps we'll meet again sometime. I am at the Sirene Club. Maybe you will drop by some evening. - Thank you. What a lovely room. That's what's I'm going to have someday. A room, exactly like this. Goodbye Madame and thank you for being so understanding. Not at all. And you Monsieur. You do understand don't you? Oh yes. I understand. I am glad. Oh .. my locket. How stupid of me. Sorry. Thank you. Well, au revoir. Au revoir. Well. That was very nice of her. Wasn't it. Yes. Wasn't it. Some tea, darling? I think the water is still hot. Thanks, dear. I think I will have a little Cognac. A busy day, darling? Yes, rather. Come. Sit down next to me and tell me all about it. Did we have our usual cabinet crisis? We have them only on Fridays now. - I forgot. You know, darling. Sometimes I sit at home feeling sort of useless and empty. And then I think of you and how important your work is. Then I think, well I am his wife. And if he is important, so am I. Then my ego is all fixed up. You are very nice. Including your ego. Darling I will have to hurry. We are having an early dinner tonight. And alone for a change. Ah. "Mademoiselle Allaine. The truth." "He is Pelletier, isn't he?" "Yes." You don't remember. Yes I do. Now wait a minute. Yes. That funny little restaurant in the mountains at the back of Caen. St Paul. That's right. Remember the old man with the violin? The Hungarian? I thought he was going to put your eye out with his bow. He kept getting so close to you. - You were jealous. Yes, I was. Excuse me just a moment, darling. - Of course, darling. For you, Monsieur. Marked private and important. Thank you. What's the matter, darling? Tell me. Office. - Really? But I thought Deval said everything was going so well. Oh yes it is, but .. Oh, how the work piles up. You know, if I could just go back there for a few hours alone. Tonight? Would you mind? No. It wouldn't take me very long. Of course, that's alright. - Darling. You sure you wouldn't feel like a wife? No, of course not. I love you. I won't be very late. I'll run all the way. Bonjour, Monsieur. Have you a reservation? I'm going to the bar. - Yes, Monsieur. "I shall be true." "And wait for you." "Until you return." "Wherever you go." "My heart is there you will know." "My heart." "And you will see." "It's not in key." "Until you return." "I shall deny temptation." "Each time I breathe your name." "You came." "And fanned a flame." "Will we begin." "Loves charms." "When I am in." "Your arms." "No-one will do." "No-one." "Until you .." "Return." Good evening, Monsieur. Rather crowed tonight. You should have made a reservation. Where can I talk to you? - My apartment is upstairs. Sit down. Would you like a drink, a cigarette or something? You can forget the amenities. Where is Sarrou? What do you want him for? I think you can guess. Well, you might want to ask him to your house to dinner or .. Then again, you might want to turn him over to the police. I want to talk to him. You can talk to me. After your kindness to me this afternoon in your office. I had a little talk with Sarrou. I am going to help him in every way possible. Every shred of decency I have tells me I shouldn't do this. I'll give you fifty thousand francs and that will be the end of it. Fifty thousand? Oh no. No, Cherie. You are not talking about cabbage. We want caviar. Besides, checks make Sarrou nervous. I can give him cash. - But not that kind of cash. Not fifty thousand francs. No. Madame, we must understand each other. At the moment you have a certain nuisance value. That is worth just so much to me. But don't make the mistake of assuming that I believe this Pelletier story. You fake. For thirteen years you have lived a lie, Jean. You fooled your wife your friends and even your country. You must have known that someday we'd meet again. What makes think you can fool me? I can see I made a mistake coming here. - You are forgetting something, Jean. Sarrou got you out of that courtroom. He can put you back into it again. Just a moment. Before you are locked up you'd better provide for those you leave behind. It won't help you if the court hears you let your own mother live like a pauper. I have no mother. - Oh no? Then go to 19 Rue Rachot and see a ghost. Good evening, Madame. Monsieur. May I come in? I .. I am an old woman. I .. I receive no visitors. The hour is late. Madame, I am in trouble. I need your help. Please. Thank you. Won't you sit down, Monsieur? Madame. I have a strange question to ask. Yes, Monsieur? Do you know me? Yes. I know you. From the trial of course. I followed it very closely. I saw your picture in the papers. I was so relieved when it was over. Why were you relieved? You were in trouble. Madame Pelletier. Do you have a son? When he was little he was a gay one. Always as busy as a bumble bee. They grow up so soon. Have you a picture of him? No. No, no, I .. I've never had a picture of him. Would you say there was any resemblance between your son and me? Some might think so. A resemblance? Yes. But to a mother .. No. I couldn't be your son? My son is dead. Everyone knows my son is dead. Why don't they leave the dead alone? Ever since the trial, people .. People have been asking questions, questions. Idle gossip. I swear it. I want only my solitude. I'm sorry. I'm an old woman, and .. I need peace. It's late. I must ask you to leave. Please, Monsieur. I need rest. Oh, Monsieur. It is a bad night. You should wear your wrappers. You will take cold. Yes. Yes, thank you. Madame. No .. no. Monsieur. God keep you. Madame. Madame. Is that you, David? Yes, dear. Darling. Don't wake. I thought you'd been asleep for hours. - Oh, I couldn't sleep. I was so worried about you. Worried? Why, dear? I didn't think you would be gone so long. Oh, darling. You promised you'd run all the way. I'm so sorry, darling. Do you know what happened? I never got to the office. Just as I was going into the building I .. Ran into one of our men who is just back from Brazil. He said he had some very important information for me, so we .. Went around to the club and got chatting and I had no idea it was so late, dear. I am so sorry. Darling. I love you so much. Don't ever leave me. And then this morning after David left for the office it .. It all came back to me again. Maybe Sarrou did forget his cigarette case and .. Maybe Madame Allaine really meant to apologize for what she said in court. But David. He is so different. I am frightened, Andre. There is nothing to be afraid of, dear. Nothing. Your nerves have had a shock. You went through the trial so beautifully. And never once did you let anyone ever see those little pangs of doubt .. That must have stabbed at your heart. You know, Lucienne. People with courage always give way to fear when the danger is past. You know that don't you. I wouldn't know what to do without you, Andre. Oh. I am ashamed now. Really. Maybe Sarrou just wanted to be paid for his testimony. That's possible, isn't it? - Oh yes, that's very possible. Andre. I have a little money and my house and the jewels. I'd give everything I have to .. - I know you would. I know. You know. The funny part is that .. If I woke up one morning and .. Found that David was Jean Pelletier. It wouldn't make any difference. Does that sound strange to you? - No. It would sound strange to me if you said it did. Alright now, Andre. You won't say anything to David? - No, I won't. No. Now you go home and forget the whole thing. David, if he were in trouble, he would come to me. He has always come to me with everything. Ever since .. For thirteen years. You know .. Oh, what a beautiful pin. Yes. David gave it to me. I love it. Goodbye, Andre. - Goodbye Lucienne, my dear. That's quite possible. Diplomacy is a craft the world no longer wants. Like staining glass. France needs soldiers today, not diplomats. Do you agree with me, David? I beg your pardon? David, I am somewhat of an important man. I just made a profound observation. I am so sorry, I was daydreaming. I agree with you, Monsieur. Diplomacy is bureaucratic deception. How are you, Monsieur? Hello. How are you? - Very well, thank you. This is Monsieur Sarrou. Monsieur Deval. Martin. Delauze. Sarrou. I am very glad to know you Monsieur. - Thank you. I owe you a debt of gratitude for what you did for our David. Won't you sit down? I would like to talk with you for a moment if I may. If you will excuse us. We will order later. - Thank you, Monsieur. You shouldn't have come here. I'm the fellow who loses his temper, Jean. Not you. What are you up to, sending that old goat to see me? What are you talking about? - Dr Tessier. Dr Tessier? - You insult my intelligence, Jean. Did you expect me to blab to the third party: "Talbot doesn't know I am here." I didn't send Dr Tessier to you. Perhaps you did send him and then forgot about it. That memory of yours again. This is no time .. If you were to meet me later .. - That's exactly what I want. To meet you tonight. And don't come alone my friend. Bring one million francs along with you because if you don't .. Then the police will have the solution to a murder. A murder in which you participated, don't forget. Yes, I've been waiting for that one. But you, not I, were the man behind the gun. And then too, there is another element. When a man turns State's Evidence. The State finds a lot in his favour. But in spite of all that. I'll rot in jail before I let you get away with that money. I've waited 13 years, Jean. Time is up. Tonight. I'll be at the La Sirene club until ten. Think it over. Is the doctor in? - Yes he is, Monsieur Talbot. Andre? - Hello, David. How are you, my boy? Andre. Why did you go to Sarrou? Well, I .. Why shouldn't I go to Sarrou? Why should you? Well .. I went to see him about this Pelletier. It's a very interesting case. Sarrou was in the hospital with him in Africa. I thought he might be able to give me a fine clinical account .. Of the behaviour of a criminal who was about to die. That's interesting, isn't it? Andre, that isn't why you saw Sarrou. - Why should you doubt me? You went to him because you didn't believe his testimony at the trial. You are afraid for me. Isn't that it? Anything that concerns you. Is important to me, David. Andre. You believe that I am Pelletier, don't you? David. The first time I ever laid eyes on you. You were in a coma. I was in the room when you first opened your eyes. As far as I am concerned you were born that day. You believe that I am Pelletier, don't you? Since that day you have been kind, honest and loyal. You are those qualities to me, David. Not a name. Andre, why won't you answer my question? I am only a doctor, David. I cannot tell you what I don't know. Let me show you something. See those books over there? Hundreds of books. Meyer, Jung, Hall, McDougall, Freud. The sum total of man's knowledge of his fellow man. And yet. In a moment like this .. they fail. That's why when I am faced with such a moment .. I always turn to this book. Older than all the others, by thousands of years. Ah, here we are. Proverbs. 23rd Chapter. 7th verse. "As a man thinketh in his heart." "So is he." As a man thinketh in his heart. That's all that matters. Solomon was a very wise man, David. Even if he did have a thousand wives. That's just it, Andre. I have only one. And if I ever thought .. If you ever thought what, David? If I thought anything could happen to Lucienne .. Why David, nothing can happen to Lucienne. Nothing can happen to her. You're right, Andre. Nothing will happen to her. Nothing. - No. You are a good friend, Andre. One ticket for Saigon, Monsieur. You take off from Le Bourget at 11:15. You arrive at Istanbul at 12 noon tomorrow. After a 3-hour stopover there you will continue on to Saigon. Via Bombay and Calcutta. You have your passport, Monsieur? - Yes. Be sure you don't forget it, Monsieur. You will not be able to fly without it. Thank you. I'll not forget it. Thank you very much. Good evening, Monsieur. - Good Evening, Pierre. Where is Madame? - Madame is in her room. I have laid out your evening things, Monsieur. Thank you. Pierre, didn't I hear Monsieur? In the library, Madame. Darling, have you forgotten all about the Devals? We are late already. Yes, darling. I know. Our passports. David. Brazil? Well. Tell me, tell me, tell me. Is it official? Darling, it isn't exactly official, no. But .. I think that privately you may address me as "Monsieur L'Ambassador". Oh, won't it be wonderful. And darling, just think. Two whole weeks alone on ship. Can't we go somewhere and celebrate? Do we have to go to that party? Oh, I forgot. I began to say. I've left Martin at the office. He's up to his ears in reports. He asked me to help him and .. He has done it so often for me that I simply couldn't refuse him. What can I tell Madame Deval? It's so late. - That's alright. You run along and I'll join you later. About eleven? Alright. And afterwards we'll do every nightspot in the town. From Zero's to Sully's. Alright, we'll go to the marketplace and have onion soup for breakfast. Yes. But, darling .. Don't mention Brazil to Deval because we must be very surprised when he tells us. David, I will swoon. - Good. Now you run along. Oh, I hate to go without you. You do? - Uhuh. Now will you go? Yes. Monsieur L'Ambassador. See you at eleven. Lucienne. Yes? That's all. [ Telephone ] [ Telephone ] Hello? Yes. I just want you to know that you're not catching a plane tonight for Saigon. Or any other place for that matter. No, no, no. I won't stop you. The police will. I've been keeping a sort-of watchful eye on you. Protecting my investment, if you know what I mean. You left the restaurant this afternoon. Then spent some time with the old goat. After that you went to Air France and bought one ticket to Saigon. Do you find my report accurate? It is? I thought you would. Well. What about our appointment for tonight? What? No. No, that won't satisfactory at all. Meet me at La Sirene tonight at ten o'clock with the money .. Or I give you my word you will be behind bars charged with murder. For heaven's sake Henri, sit down. You are driving me crazy. I don't suppose he is not coming. No, no. He has still got ten minutes. Ah, I knew he didn't have the nerve. I told you not to come here. - You told me a lot of things. You told me I'd get my money in a few weeks, but I haven't. I've been living in that rat-hole for three months now. Doing my own work. Look at my hands. Stop whimpering. We are all in this together, aren't we? You are frightened, Sarrou. When you make a man believe he is someone else, time becomes the essence. Give him enough time and he is bound to find out. Well, I did my part. I made him believe. What a performance. "My son is dead." "Everyone knows my son is dead." "Why don't they leave the dead alone?" He cringed, my dear. Positively cringed. Alright, alright. You are a great actress. I would have been if I hadn't left the stage and married Le Duc. When are you going to get him out? - Shut up. He has just come into the caf?. Hurry, up. Hurry up. Get out of here. Alright, alright. Take the bottle with you. Compose yourself, Henri. You are supposed to be the cat, not the mouse. Remember? Don't try to be funny please. You're in this too you know. - I'm not forgetting it for a moment. Are you so terribly stupid .. That you don't see what happens to us if this fool ever suspects suspect that .. Shush. Here he is. Come in. Come in, Jean. Come right in. Have you got the money? No. Well, your influential friends now have until ten o'clock to rally round you. Sarrou. Can a man just go to his friends and ask them for a million francs? You have a very devoted wife. Yes, and those jewels must be worth .. Well, at least half a million, not counting the house. But I cannot go to my wife and say: "Darling, I am a murderer". "Please let me have a million francs." I can. Say just that. Madame, your husband is a murderer. Just a small loan. Would you mind? Well, there is no sense in wasting any more time. Sarrou. I want to get you the money. I'd do anything to have this nightmare off my back. Believe me, it hasn't been easy for me. Sitting up there in my office handling large sums for the government. He handles large sums of money for the government. Go on, Jean. That money isn't mine. That is a trust from the republic. Oh, please. No vulgar appeals to our patriotism. - No. This is business. But .. don't you see they would know in a minute. The safe is in my office. I'm the only one who has keys. Jean. You have forgotten a lot of things you used to know very well. I don't know what you mean. - Oh, come now. A man goes to his own office where he has a perfect right to be. While he is opening the safe, he is attacked. Bound and gagged. The next morning he is found by the char woman. The safe has been rifled. You are completely innocent. You go back to your own life. Your career. Your wife. Brazil. What guarantee have I that .. We'll disappear. You'll not hear of us again. What about that picture? Well, that you can have as soon as we get the money. Something to remember me by. Good evening, Monsieur Martin. Hello Charles. - Lucienne. Where is David? Didn't he come with you? - No. I haven't seen David. But I thought when you saw him this evening that .. I didn't see him. I've been in London all afternoon. I just flew in. Oh. Well. I must have been dreaming. Do forgive me. Marie .. my cape please. Certainly, Madame. Pleases tell Madame Deval that I was taken with a bad headache and went home. Yes, Madame. Wait. Follow that cab. Good evening, Monsieur Talbot. - Good evening. I have to get a cable off. Won't be long. A fuse blew out, Monsieur Talbot. I will fix it right away. That's alright. I'll find my way. The light. It is simpler opening them with keys, isn't it Jean. Beautiful. Beautiful. Alright. Leave everything just as it is. Lucienne. David, no, no, no. David. Lucienne. You mustn't be here. Don't do it. Don't. Please don't, David. There is nothing else to do. - But there is. There must be. You are frightened now. I know you are but I will be with you. We will face it together but can't you see this won't help anything. There is no other way. I won't let you do it. I won't. I'll .. I'll tell the police. I leave here with this money. Or I will call the police. You be the judge, Madame. Why do you suppose I am doing this? What do you want me to do? Help me tie him up. Come on, Jean. You found him robbed and gagged. Tied in a chair. The perfect alibi. Give me a chance to get out of here. And then you can scream as loud as you like. Alright. Put your finger here. Come on. Hurry up. Alright. - Hmm. Did you hear something? No. Madame Talbot, I hesitate to enter your name into the police book. All France knows your family and its record of honour and integrity. Monsieur Le Commissar, my wife had nothing to do with this. She came to my office tonight quite by accident. She had been there for .. Take your hands off me. What am I, a peasant that I should be dragged off by these .. dog catchers? We only want you for questioning. - Questioning? You recognize these two men and this lady don't you? Come now. You were a witness in the Le Duc trial. Where Henri Sarrou presented evidence .. Which proved that this gentleman was not a criminal named Jean Pelletier. Monsieur Le Commissar. I am Jean Pelletier. David. David. On March 27th 1922 I participated in the robbery of a bank messenger. I was also involved in his murder. No. No, it isn't true. David, you don't know what you are saying. But I do, Lucienne. I do. Please, Monsieur. My husband hasn't been himself. Monsieur Le Commissar. You must ignore this man's statement. He has complete retrograde amnesia. He can remember nothing .. Prior to waking up in my hospital after the wreck. This murder took place two days before that. Thank you. Is this true, Monsieur? - Quite true. Then how do you know you were involved in this robbery and murder? I was told. - By whom? By my accomplice in the crime. Henri Sarrou. I can't go on knowing that I helped murder a man, Sarrou. I can't live with it anymore. Ever since you told me .. - David, please. Sarrou, I beg of you, and you too Michelle. Let's confess everything and throw ourselves on the mercy of the state. Mademoiselle Allaine was connected with the crime? At that time, Monsieur. She and I were .. Well, we were more than just friends as you can see from this locket. She drove me to the station after the murder. No. No. I never saw this man. Not until that day I testified in court. - Shut up. Henri, this is murder. Do you want the guillotine? We'd nothing to do with murder. I'll do the talking. You've talked too much. That's why we're here. The perfect blackmail plot. It couldn't fail. Shut up, you fool. - I won't shut up. He is not Jean Pelletier. Pelletier was killed. In the wreck of the Paris/Marseilles express. Sarrou and Le Duc went to the hospital after the wreck. And found Pelletier among the dead. While they were there they also learned that one of the survivors .. Monsieur Talbot. Was suffering from amnesia. And you waited all these years to blackmail me? He waited until you had something to lose. He planned everything. Even that picture in the locket. It's a fake. A superimposure. Well Monsieur Talbot, I think we've heard all we need to hear. Henri Sarrou. Michelle Allaine. I hereby order you to stand trial and decree you be remanded in prison .. Until such time as you are tried by the state. But it was his idea I tell you. - Come along. You hysterical fool. - Hysterical? Wait until you hear me at the trial. Well, Monsieur Talbot. You certainly took a desperate chance. Oh, not really Monsieur. I knew I wasn't Pelletier. David, this afternoon when you left my office you were so convinced. When I left your office this afternoon I thought it was the end of the world. And darling. When you left me at home tonight. I thought my heart would break. And then dear, as I stood there staring at our passport pictures. Something about it reminded of this picture in the locket. Yes. The association of ideas. That is very natural. But still I don't understand how you .. - Andre. When I was brought to your hospital after the wreck. On which side was my hair parted? On this side, David. On the right side. His head was cut open right along the part. He had to take seven stitches. - Right. And then afterwards .. We changed the part to the left side so that my hair would cover the scar. But David, what has that to do with .. - Look, darling. That picture is supposed to have been taken before the accident. Look at it carefully, dear. What's wrong with it? Of course. The part is on the left side. - Exactly. Then you knew that this picture must have been taken after the accident. Oh darling, you are wonderful. Ahem. Sorry. Of course, when you phoned me tonight and told me to send for the police. He thought I had gone out of my head. Mind you, setting the trap was easy enough. The problem was how to get Sarrou into it. How did you do it, David? By two simple little words, Monsieur. "Government funds". He took the bait at one gulp. My boy, if you handle the Brazilian embassy as well as you handled this .. We'll all be proud of you. And if you don't, there will always be a job for you in the Bureau of Detectives. Let me go! Let me go, you pig! What is the meaning of this? 0h, it is you, Monsieur. Why have they brought me here? Tell them. They shouldn't disturb an old woman in the middle of the night. Mother. I am afraid you are a dead pigeon. I do not understand. All I ask is my solitude. That is what you are going to get, Madame. Ten years of it. Ha! Ten? Darling. Please. Remember where we are. Remember. But darling, how can I? I have amnesia. (Ro_s)
