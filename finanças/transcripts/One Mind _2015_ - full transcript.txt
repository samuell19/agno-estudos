You're back! Get me your ordination ID. Is this space free? You can stay here. - That space is taken. Let's look next door. - There's space next door. I got here yesterday. Here is good. - Let me get you some hot water. I've got hot water here. In ancient India and ancient China... people placed great value upon their hair. Especially the people of ancient India. Cutting someone's hair off was almost worse... Well let's just say, he'd rather you kill him. It would be too humiliating. And in China it was the same. The ancient Chinese thought... that because this body comes from our parents... ...we don't dare defile it. So they respected hair and beard. But a monk wants to destroy his concept of "self". Take the self and break it apart. Not a single piece of this flesh and blood is "me". The Buddha wanted his monks... to break apart this kind of attachment to self. So he made them shave their heads. Householders think it's very beautiful to adorn their hair. But Buddhists don't think like this. Beautiful or not... when you die it's still just a pile of bones. There's nothing worth holding on to. It's okay, I used to raise turtles. This one doesn't listen. That one wants to run off. But those two won't run off. Just three? Don't run off! "Find refuge in the Buddha, refuge in the Teachings, refuge in the Community..." Don't kill. Don't eat meat. Eat vegetarian! The others are so well-behaved. Why are you so naughty? Be good. Find your enlightenment! Have all three been blessed? Put them straight in the water. No, no, over there! Be careful with them! Being Buddhist means cultivating a kind heart. But we aren't just born with this kindness. It takes many lifetimes of hard work. A kind heart must have deep roots to grow strong. This is the seed of buddhahood. You didn't plant the squash yet? - Not yet, I'm planting the pumpkin right now. Which way should my group go? Which way? Wait for the team leader, he'll take you up there. A lot of monks are out working today, so we need to coordinate. Team leaders can show you what's left to be harvested. Everyone's going up the hills today. I'm going to split everyone into two groups, okay? You all will go up last. I didn't learn to grow tea until I came down south here. I didn't know a thing about tea. This is a perfect leaf. We call this "two leaves, one bud". This Zen tea... you need a quiet mind to experience it. When you drink tea... be mindful of the place from where mind arises. If there are thoughts there... then when you drink the tea... you won't taste Zen. This tea, is mind. But you don't need mind to know it. Wrap it up! Let's head back! Prepare for evening meditation. Look at all the tea we picked. Pretty good. Whoa, look at this brother here! He's up there all day and this is all he comes back with! Because I only pick the best leaves. Before becoming a monk I was a salesman. I sold health-care products. To sell things I'd exaggerate how good they are. Then maybe I'd not mention the bad things. I think every salesman exaggerates the truth like this. And maybe they hide something too. Sleeping at night, my conscience got the better of me. I felt conflicted. Everyone said this is normal... But I couldn't fool myself any longer. Come back! Three days ago, I'd just taken over this work. The ox had run into the forest there. The next day he was running all over in the fields here. He fooled around there, turning and lolling about. I was asleep here. I woke up and chased him again. But he'd disappeared. You have to keep searching after him and stay vigilant. Soon as you look away, he'll run off again. It's tough to be human. You want to get a grip on this mind... But it's not so easy. Just about ready!
