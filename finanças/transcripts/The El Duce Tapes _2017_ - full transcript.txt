[Cheering] Alright, alright, alright, shut up! Shut up! Shut your goddamn mouth, and let me make a piece of my mind. Alright! Everybody that likes to rape women, say, "Sieg Heil!" [Crowd] Sieg Heil! What are we doing? We... [♪ Music plays] [♪ Music plays] Yeah! [Siren wails] [Indistinct police radio] [Man] What's up? [Woman] Huh? I guess we're going home. I'm trying to bring peace to this world. I hope you guys are happy. It's real stoked. Peace! Love! Whatever... - No it doesn't. - It happens all the time. It's good shit, man. [Applause] We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons. [Cheering] [♪ Distorted version of "The Star Spangled Banner"] If you believe in free speech, people have the right to burn a cross people have a right to burn the flag. It's offending people, and it's offending somebody's religion or offending somebody's love of country. What's the difference? You offend people every day. Should you go to jail? [Screaming indistinct lyrics] I wanna take the president, chop off his head, and mail it to them in a garbage bag. [♪ Music plays] ♪ Hinkley had a vison ♪ Hinkley had a vision... [♪ Indistinct lyrics] [♪ Indistinct lyrics] [Audience] Jerry! Jerry! - Jerry! Jerry! - [Jerry] Thank you very much! [Announcer] 'And now, here he is, 'the conservative voice of television, 'Wally George!' [Overlapping dialogue] Today we're gonna take a look into the world of shock rock, rock music that is violent, scary, and even perverse. We have one of the most disgusting perverts I've ever seen in my whole life on the show here. [Booing] [Jerry] Here is El Duce. [Applause] [Booing] [Wally George] Hold on! Hey, hold it! How do you describe your music? [El Duce] Well, it's rape rock. - [Wally George] "Rape rock"! - [Booing] You know, I wanna be polite to anyone who comes on our show, but I gotta say, when I hear that you promote rape, that is not only thoroughly disgusting, but it can't possibly be viewed as entertainment. Well, it is to me. [Man] Duce! I have two sons, a sixteen-year-old who's sitting in the audience now, an a ten-year-old, and I try to teach my sons how to be respectful, and that sodomizing people... Do you realize that Sodom and Gomorrah in the Bible was destroyed by God because that was wrong? Do you realize that? I like music, but I do not like things that promote violence against people. Let me ask you something. When were you raped? I was raped in '70. You look kind of familiar, I have to say. - No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - [Audience groans] Sorry. [Jerry] That's just... That's just plain disrespectful. - I mean, that's not... - He doesn't know any better. That's not a point of view. [Audience cheering] Oh, Wally! You shouldn't have the right to be on any stage or any radio station in the United States of America. [Jerry] And now, here they are: Gwar. - Uh, you like Gwar, huh? - Yes. Is it OK that some of the message, let's say, is violent? - Would that be OK? - Yes. That's OK? [Cheering] Well, um, obviously... I think, yeah, ours is simulated. [Man] And theirs is real! - One time... - When he's on the sauce! When he's on the sauce! One time, we had the misfortune of taking El Duce... Being on bus with him is horrible. ...from New York City... The whole band, the whole band... There's sixteen of us, and all of them in our bus. It was like... no room at all to do anything. We were taking him from New York City to Richmond. He had this punching balloon like kids play with. He kept whacking it. First, he started spitting on it, like, licking big loogies on it, and then he'd go, boogey-boogey-boogey... so it splashed everywhere. - Yeah. - But then... - But then... - He peed on it. And he was, like, running around the bus, going tk-uh-tk-uh-tk-uh... into people's face with this pee balloon. He gets on stage, pulls his pants down, pulls his dick out, and starts flopping it around and stuff, and then some super sick gross slut runs out on stage and starts sucking him off in front of the whole audience. - And... - Gross! Eurgh! In front of the whole fucking audience! And the bouncers didn't do a goddamn thing. [Woman] OK, this is because.. He's one of the weirdest guys I know, man. I like him. I like him, because he's always nice to me. He always is nice to me, but I really... You know, it does bother me a little bit, the way he treats women. Very early on, he started referring to the band as "rape rock", which I... If you asked me earlier, was there anything, any song or anything that really, uh... I thought was going a little too far, when he first came out with that, I thought that was going a little too far. Personally, I'm not in favor of rape, you know, I think it's hideous, and uh... So, to that extent, I think that's going a little too far, but again, that's his personal vision. [Ryan] What kind of people go to your gigs? Uh, we get sort of a broad mix, you know, we get a lot of your kind of nihilistic punkers and some of your intellectuals. [Ryan] What do you think of your brother? I think he's rocking. Is he? - He's a real man. - Yeah. El Duce, your brother, is a real man? - He's a real Aryan man. - [El Duce] Yeah! Yeah! Sieg Heil! [Grunts] ♪ Your daughter is my victim ♪ Yeah-eee-ay! [Ryan] So El Duce is, um... Do El Duce's lyrics offend you? No, not really. The one song, "On The Rag", kind of... [Laughs] "When I'm On The Rag", that bothers me. But... Do you think he is serious about his lyrics, or do you think he's kind of just trying to have a laugh? I think a little of both. I don't know which more, you know, which one is more... But... Does he ever scare you? No. He's... you know, he's pretty nice, you know... for being a Mentor, you know. Where do you think he gets his ideas for lyrics? Mm... From um... what he's seen other people cringe about. Like a few... He loves to see people cringe. [Broy] Even once or twice I think they picketed, feminist groups have picketed the man. [Chanting] Rape rock is not a joke! Rape rock is not a joke! What do you think of the demonstration that's going on outside? I think it's great. [TV] 'Ted Weatherhead, CBC News, Winnipeg.' You know, a lot of girls trip out about it, but... you know, they shouldn't take that all so seriously. Do you think it's clever? Yeah. Yeah, the way they come up with these ideas. It's pretty perverted, but, you know... It's really funny that they think of these things. I figure, you know, El Duce is his own man. He's, uh... In his own way he's a genius and a great comedian and a great musician. So I don't want to attempt to put his point of view through my filter. You know, I'm content to play my part with the music and whatever he comes up with in terms of his lyrics, uh... You know, I'm a great El Duce fan, just from being in the band, it's great to watch him come up with new lyrics and funny lines. So I would consider myself probably one of the greatest connoisseurs of what he does, and I'm able - at least I think I am - to recognize a good El Duce performance from a bad one. I think to a certain extent, he's, like, a great artist in that he doesn't really give a damn what people think of him. You know, if you look at a Van Gogh or something like that, these guys are so far out in their own thing... they're just doing what they're doing, they're on the auto pilot. And I think he's on auto pilot. He's not calculating anything in minute details. He's not saying, "I'm going to sing this particular line "cos I think this is going to make the biggest impact." I think he's going to do what he... what comes naturally. It's a legitimate expression of his own psyche. Um... That's kind of a tough one, I guess maybe "Free Fix For A Fuck" is a big favorite of mine. The lyrics that sort of pictorialized abuse to women and all that doesn't bother you? Well, I like the "Straight Out Of Compton" NWA tape, too. I heard that and I ran down and bought it. It's talking about stuff that is in some people's heads. He'll bring it out. Like... If El and them... If they were just running around raping chicks that didn't want to be raped and doing all this shit, if NWA was out gangbanging, I wouldn't be into their music. But they're musicians, they're not into that stuff at all. You know, they're just talking about a reflection of part of the human condition. And El has just... He has such a humorous twist to it, nobody could take it offensively. [El Duce] Turn on the camera, I'm ready to rock. [Ryan chuckling] You better have that camera on there, Ryan. Is that right? [Indistinct] [Man 1] Does this light work? [Man 2] Yeah. Peaceful rape. What's peaceful rape? That's when you knock a broad out on... [hiccups] Thorazine, maybe some, um... 'ludes. So you don't believe in, uh... No, no, let me finish. Then hypnotism. Babe... take your bra off. Slut. Peel your panties off. [Snorts] [Smacking] Your clitoris here. Lock them legs. [Blows raspberry] [Squelching, slurping] Uh! Uh! Mm... [Blows raspberry] Ah! Swallow it. It's as easy as that. Heil Hitler. Mm! Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm... Mm! Mm! Mm! Have you always drank for relaxation? I've been an alcoholic all my life. I stole my first beer from my dad. - El Duce likes to drink a lot. - Yeah. He says he has an alcohol problem. Yeah he's a full-on alcoholic. El Duce when he's sober is a really nice guy, when he's drunk he's horrible. That way I know that only I can drink it. Anybody who drinks it, drinks my spit. El Duce drinks a lot when he's around you? Yeah. He probably drinks a lot when he's not around you. Yeah. Is that a problem for you? Sometimes when he's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. [Laughs] What do you think of El as a human being? Well, see, personally I'm really fond of him, and... I don't know, part of it is because we worked at the Ivar Theater together for a long time, We have memories... you know, about all the shit that went down there. You also are the Master of Ceremonies at one of the grimiest places I know of in Hollywood, the Ivar Theater, which features naked dancers. [Belches] You worked at the Ivar Theater? Yeah. Is that the best job you ever had? Yeah. I worked there for about eight years, I got to run the spot light and play the girls cassette tapes and play the porno movies and announce the girls, all up in the light booth. Yeah, he was the light man at the Ivar. Yeah. So, he brought Steve by? No, actually he wanted me to go dance, do a show cos the chicks he had doing his show... were flaking out. And I'd listened to his music, I thought his music was really good, but that wasn't my scene, I wasn't into going. But my girlfriend Zylmar says, "Yeah let's go, let's go." So I said, "OK." And then when I started meeting these other guys, you know. Yes. Yes. I'm stripper at the Ivar Theater, and I'm damn proud of it, too! Right on, Duce! Hey, all you sluts out there, are tired of hanging out with a bunch of low-life glam rock fags? Why don't you go for a real man, a booze-guzzling, porno-reading man? Just enter the Mentors Dream Date Contest, and you can win a good date with me, El Duce. [Cackles] Do what they're doing in these dirty magazines with me, baby. How long have you been El Duce's girlfriend? Um... About six weeks. So, how did you run into him? The first time that I met him, just hanging out in Hollywood, just hanging out drinking, trashing. Do you remember the first time you met him? Yeah. Yeah, I remember. Saw him on the street. It was him and a couple of his friends, and I was the only girl there, and they wanted to not hang out in Hollywood drinking, cos of the cops, and they wanted to go to this one place. First I was up for it, and then I started thinking, "This is El Duce. "There's three guys and just one of me." And I just kind of blew them off. I was like, "I forgot I got something to do." You know, I thought something would happen. What did you hear about him? Oh, a lot of stories. You know, El Duce stories, his reputation. - Like what? - About... [Laughs] About being a big pervert and stuff he does to girls and stuff. You know, cos this guy said, "Oh, he'll piss all over you, he'll rape you," this and that, you know, and I was kind of scared of him. Do a lot of girls come on to El Duce at the concerts? Enough do. Yeah, I... I think one is enough, you know, too much. Duce say anything to 'em? Oh, yeah, he loves it. Does he treat you nicely? Yeah, he treats me pretty good. How did you all get together as Mentors? Well, The Mentors got together in Seattle, and we've been childhood friends. I've known El Duce since we were in 4th grade. We went to the same elementary school together, and then I met Sickie when we were in 7th grade. We're all the same age. 1976. Right when the Sex Pistols came out. - Before. - Before? First of all, I can't believe that El Duce is only 32, though. How old are you going to be this birthday? - Same age as Jesus Christ. - As they were nailing him down. Hey, if he could be nailed, I'll be nailed. If Jesus could take it, I can take it. When did you start playing music? When I was about seven years old. And then I got really into the drums and I'd listen to records that my mom and dad would play and stuff. When my dad was drunk and in a good mood, trying to fuck my mom, and they'd put on the Tijuana Brass or whatever, you know, and I'd listen to it and I'd go like, "Wow man, "I dig that drum sound." You know. [♪ Drums and brass playing] He started drums very early. I think he started drum lessons in 3rd or 4th grade, and he had so much native talent that he established himself very quickly in the drumming classes. The best student, essentially. And I think when he was in 6th grade, he joined this All City Youth Orchestra, you know, which was like the crème de la crme of all musicians in Seattle, you know, the child musicians. So he played big concerts at the Symphony Hall with this youth orchestra. Then he was later in drum corps, which is a marching kind of drum corps thing. He was always very good at that. He could read music very well and knew his way around the drums perfectly. What really motivated me was Jimmy Hendrix Experience. I wanted to play drums like Mitch Mitchell. Then I got a hip to The Who and I wanted to play like Keith Moon. And then I got into jazz fusion music. Then I wanted to play like Billy Cobham. And then as time marched by, I just kind of combined all those styles, all into my own style. He was into sort of funk and jazz rock and stuff like that which we were into, too, like Mahavishnu Orchestra and Chick Corea, "Return to Forever", and all that kind of fusion jazz rock that was going on at the time. If you were into this kind of advanced Jazz fusion type of music that not many people were playing, kids your age anyway, how did you end up in sort of the punk rock and metal areas? Well, I guess in a way it was sort of a conscious sell-out. We were so into this fusion thing and we tried to play fusion, we worked up a lot of these original songs in the band before The Mentors, the Eldon Hoke Band, we played exclusively instrumental fusion. But there was just nowhere to play it. There was one club I remember that they advertised that they wanted that kind of stuff, and we went in there and tried to get a gig there. They wouldn't let us play there. It just was going nowhere, so it was sort of the kind of thing that we... I guess you'd consider it a conscious sell-out. Well, see, no one really understood our fusion music, so I said, "We got to entertain these clowns, "so let's sing some dirty lyrics. "Throw them in there." So we went from jazz fusion... to perversion, and then we just broke it down into easy rock that they could understand. - Punk rock. - Yeah, punk rock. The Dean of Students at Roosevelt High school. I used to cause a lot of vandalism, cos I hated everybody. I used to blow up toilets with M-80s, and... you know, write dirty drawings all over the walls and shoplift. I did everything, and set fires, I did all kinds of shit. Anything that raised hell, I would do it. You know, I used to urinate in jars and pour them on the radiators in the morning because it was freezing cold in Seattle, like it was 40 degrees outside, you're freezing cold. You come into the school, you want to warm up, and here is a radiator with urine smell pouring off of it. I used to shit in foil and stack it in the freezer and I'd take it to school, let it thaw out, and then I'd smear it all over the door knobs of all the classrooms, and vomit. I did all kinds of sick shit. I could go on for hours telling you all the sick shit I did. But I was just the number one nuisance to the school. So finally I'm in this language arts class, and the teacher gets this call, "Will you send El Duce down to the Dean of Students?" Oh, no! Some dipshit finked me off. So I go down there, and sure enough these two idiots that were working for me... [Farts] So I go in there, acting all smooth and shit, and I sit down, the Dean of Students goes, "Alright, El Duce... "I have had reports that you are the one behind everything. "You're the mentor." And I go, "What?" He goes, "You're the mentor behind it all." I just drilled it in my head and I go, "Mentor? "What do you mean, mentor?" And he goes, "Look it up here in the dictionary." And he throws the dictionary and he goes, "See that? "Read that to me." And I go, "Mentor, the one that everybody looks up to..." "You are the one who instructed all these guys "to shit and piss and throw garbage all over the school, "because you are the mentor." And he threw this big fit about me being the mentor. So I just said, "Fine, that's the name of the band, "it's got to be The Mentors." [Laughs] [Applause] Rockin' and a rollin' all the way Do you guys fight a lot in the band? Um, me and Steve don't, but Sickie throws in the wrench every time he can. Boy, maybe you should write down some questions. Me and Sickie bicker probably the worst. What do you bicker about? Little petty ass things, the more pettier, the more we bicker. Do you fight about the music? No, we fight about whose beer is whose. - No, I said Miller's Special. - You owe me five bucks. How do I owe you five bucks? Because I loaned you the money to get it. Wow, Miller's on sale. Do you have a car? Yeah, you came out in a car. After the gig, while Broy's waiting around getting paid, we can trunk up, so we just better get the six. Miller in cans, I hate that shit. You owe me five bucks. How do I owe you five? Because I paid for the fucking beer, and you owe me two beers and you wanted me to loan you the money. Broy owes you the money, he couldn't pay you, so I gave you five bucks out of that. Duh. Just take five dollars' worth. Yeah... - I want my $5 back. - That's the whole thing... I loaned you five dollars so he could get some beer. - Right. - Right, so you owe me 5 bucks. No, you get your two beers. No, you owe me five dollars. I owe you five bucks but if you want to get... And two beers! Five dollars and two beers. It's not that hard to figure it out. We've got this one clown, Ed Danky, in our band that's sort of in the band and sort of not in the band. [Belches] I think Mr. Danky has something to say. We're over here, and this is Sneaky Spermshooter down here on the ground. - Time to rock. - It's time to rock? We're ready to blow. - Ready to blow? - Yeah, heavy rock is coming up. He doesn't believe in the Four F club, and, you know, it doesn't work. How long have you known El Duce? Oh, I've known the scum bag about, oh, 10 grueling years. In what capacity have you worked with him? I do a little background vocals for them sometimes, and I jam with the guys all the time, and you know, I guess I'm like the Billy Preston of The Mentors. I remember you at that bar when you saw that. I saw this, and I went apeshit. A lot of the songs are sex oriented. Were they back then? Uh, yeah. Yeah, we kind of hit upon that as a gimmick. See, El Duce was... The one thing he was known for when we going to junior high was, he was known as the guy who had all the pornography. His dad was a porno collector, and his dad tried to hide this porno from El Duce. He had this little work room that was all locked up in the basement, but El Duce knew how to pick the lock, and he'd go down there while his dad and mum were off at work, and he'd have his buddies come over and he'd show them all the porn, and he'd give some of the magazines away. So, El Duce had a real reputation as being sort of porn-meister. And El Duce would do this drum solo with these dildos he bought, these, you know, like, about 14 inch dildos he bought down at the porno store, and it was just a big gimmick thing, you know, I guess. I don't know if we thought of it like that, but that was basically how it wound up. [♪ Music playing] ♪ I got a donkey dick ♪ It will make you sick ♪ I got a donkey dick ♪ It's big and thick Not all of our stuff is pornographic. I mean if you listen to it carefully, you know, the total catalogue, now I haven't tabulated it all, but I'd say maybe 50% is not wholly concerned with sex. First thing we do when we wake up in the morning - is take a shower... - [El Duce] No. - ...and put on a fresh hood. - Jack off! This hood smells like Sickie, though. - I know. - Disgusting. That's what you get for putting on his hood. It's not a fresh hood. [Ryan] Why the hoods? [Broy] That was El Duce's idea. He had this idea when we put together The Mentors, that they'd have this very strong image. [El Duce] I saw it in the horror films and I go, "That's what we'll do, we'll all wear execution hoods." You see, I saw KISS do their thing. I go, "We got to be as outrageous as KISS." El Duce told me that he scheduled their first tour by calling around people and telling them that he had the most incredible KISS cover band that there was, and then he took just the KISS album, like, he taped a compilation of KISS records and sent them as a demo tape out to people, and then, like... You know, that was his press kit, it was this demo tape that was just KISS, and he's like, "We're one of the most incredible KISS simulation "that has ever been," - and then they show up and... - Play El Duce! ...and they're the fucking... they're The Mentors. [♪ Music playing] [Ryan] How do you describe Mentors music? What is it to you? Uh, male chauvinism rock. ♪ All women are insane ♪ Some were born with no brain ♪ Bitch and cuss on the rag ♪ They are one hell of a drag ♪ If everything don't go their way ♪ They must fuck and suck me for their pay ♪ Males are superior ♪ Females are inferior Do you think Mentors music is a joke? No it's a form of life. I just speak about what's on my mind and what I believe. So when did the ideology emerge in him? Uh, the whole... become fully flowered you mean? It was probably after The Mentors had been together for about two or three years, when it really... you know, became very monolithic like that. It was just sort of a slow evolution. - What about "Golden Showers"? - Oh, yeah. See, I caught this one girl cheating on me. She goes, "He was so cute, can you blame me?" and I go, "Yeah, I can." "I'm going to have to give you the treatment." She goes, "Whatever you want, I love you... "Oh, I love you." I said, "All right, prove your love." Now Mr. Chairman, one point we've already made, the material which has caused the concern is new and different. It's not just a continuation of controversies of past generations. To illustrate this point, we would like to show a slide presentation. The purpose of this presentation is to acquaint you with the type of material that is in question. I will be covering the themes of violence and sexuality. Bear in mind that what you are about to see and hear is a small sample of the abundant material available today. Ozzy Osborne, on his first solo album shown here, sings a song called "Suicide Solution". Ozzy insists that he in no way encourages suicidal behavior in young people, and yet he appears in photographs such as these. For those of you who can't make that out because of the lights, it's a picture of Ozzy with a gun barrel stuck into his mouth. My apologies. How bad can it get? The list is endless. This album was released just recently by a band called The Mentors. It was released on the label Enigma Records, which also launched Motley Crue's career. The album includes songs like "Four F Club: Find Her, Feel Her, Fuck Her And Forget Her", "Free Fix For A Fuck", "Clap Queen", "My Erection is Over", and the song "Golden Showers" which says these words, "Listen you little slut, do as you're told, "come with Daddy for me to pour the gold. "Golden showers, all through my excrements you shall roam, "bend up and smell my anal vapor, "your face is my toilet paper, "on your face I leave a shit tower, "golden showers." Mr. Chairman that concludes my remarks, I thank you. [Chairman] I'm sorry your time has expired. [Laughing] Thanks to the PMRC, we tripled our sales, we're like a nothing band for a while, then the PMRC came up there and bitched about us, next thing you know our records skyrocketed. It's all just bullshit. I mean, he's successful because he gets a reaction. It's like there's a need for that in society, otherwise it's just boring and dull. I mean, people... you know, they get all upset and they go to the Senate, and they do all this protesting and all that stuff that just hypes his trip. The records start selling more, and I mean, mean they're doing the... They're giving him just what he wants. And I got to give him a lot of credit. Man, he gets away with it. He's exactly... he's a total success in himself. [Cheering, booing] [Man] El Duce! What kind of clubs were you playing before the PMRC? Holes in the wall, dives, somebody's backyard, but when the PMRC... [Laughs] When they snapped into action, man, we started playing big halls, auditoriums. ♪ Bend up and smell my anal vapor ♪ Your face is my toilet paper ♪ Golden shower... [El Duce laughs] [Ryan] What kind of bands did you play with? Well, we started off playing with just everybody's local brother's band, you know. and then once the PMRC kicked into action, we started playing with big groups, like Metal Church, Montrose, Ronnie Montrose, Plasmatics. Probably the biggest bands we played with is, like, Fear and Killing Joke, Black Flag. What's the best road experience you ever had with The Mentors? Probably with Saint Vitus. I got laid about seven times on that tour. If you just look at LA, you know, the past few years, there's a huge explosion of metal bands that are coming out and being very popular, Poison and you know, whomever else, Warrant. But I think these guys are extremely calculated. First of all, they're part of a very big money making machine. Any time you're in that... your league, you're talking to a big conglomerate putting a lot of money into you, expecting you to behave professionally as far as not blowing shows, you know, showing up on time, producing a record on time, things of that nature. This band, you know, Mentors is not set up for that at all. I'm not sure if people will listen to us in 100 years. I think they might... as opposed to a band that's somewhat disposable, enjoyable music, quality music, but yet easily replaced. So you see Mentor's music as what? As art, I would consider it art to the extent where most music that's sold is less art, and more of it just product, it's a commercial product. What constitutes art to you? I think art has got... True art is something that is independent of time. Uh... I would say it deals with lasting human themes that are, again, time-independent to an extent. They sign a lot of these glam rock bands, tens of thousands of these bands and all look the same, all sound the same, you can't tell one band from the other. but you could always tell The Mentors, cos we stand out. We're tired of sissy groups like Motley Crue and all this sissy stuff. We want rape rock. Sneaky, what do you think of the Beatles? - Who? - The Beatles. They don't rock. ♪ You ♪ Are ♪ My ♪ Sex slave They could say, "Bon Jovi is really on an up move," you know whatever, I don't care if he goes up or down. I've got my lyrics, and if they don't like it, they can eat shit out of my ass. I want to ask you something. What does your mother think about you? Huh? Was El Duce... Early on was he a sort of a teddy bear of a guy or was he mean, was he good? Was he... I mean, he was obviously your friend. Yeah. Um... I wouldn't call him Mr. Nice guy. He had a lot of weird aspects to his personality. He was... See, he was from a family of four, OK? As far as other kids. He had two sisters and one brother. Now, one brother and one sister were older than he was, and they were very good students, and his father is... or was a highly paid, high-up in the bureaucracy, engineer at Boeing. He was an aeronautical engineer. And so there was a certain amount of expectation put on El Duce to follow in the good student footsteps of these two elder siblings. But he just wasn't cut out for that kind of thing and he... You know, I think a couple of times he almost got put back a grade, and that kind of scarred his personality to a certain extent. [Ryan] Was, um... As a kid or a teenager was El Duce lazy? Extremely. Extremely lazy. Did he... Was he... Always since birth. - Dramatically different than... - Since birth he was... And he's one of those people that work harder at not working. Like if he would... You know what I'm saying? All these lengths to avoid doing the simple task, if he would have done the simple task, he wouldn't have to go to all this other bullshit, you know what I mean? Does that make sense? Now, I don't give a damn about books... because I don't care what year George Washington flipped a coin across the Delaware River or whatever, I'll find that out later, when I'm damn well ready. So how did he become such a good drummer? It was the one thing that he clung on too that he couldn't... I think also he could take out a lot of anger on those drums. A lot of anger towards my father. You know what? That's me as little bastard right there. I'm going like, "Who's going to fuck up my life, "then make me the weirdo that I is right now?" Right? Tells myself, "I ain't fucked up, I ain't weird, I ain't nothing." What's your family like? Square. My dad designed bombs. He designed part of the Apollo 11... that landed on the moon. What about your mother? She was a secretary. What was your childhood like, growing up? Oh, my dad beat me all the time. He got a thrill out of it, boy. His eyes would light up when he cracked that whip. Bam! [Screams] And I'd go like, "Yow!" The more I yelled, the more he got a turn-on. And your mother? Well, she just closed her ears and closed her eyes and said, "It's not real, it's not real." I said, "It is real." And I started the ball rolling with my dad, because of my grade card. I got nothing but flunks and bad grades when I was a kid. He goes, "Why aren't you as smart as your brother and sister?" And I said, "Well, because I'm smarter. "I do not submit." I mean, that's what I was thinking on my head. I didn't tell my dad that, but that's what I was thinking. I do not submit to people that order me around. He says his dad... he says your dad beat him when he was a kid. Were you aware of that? He spanked him really hard with a paddle, yeah. He did that to me, too. We feared our father like Hitler. We did not... we didn't respect him. It wasn't healthy respect, it was downright fear. I mean, this is what my dad used to do there. He drilled holes like that big around in his paddle... to get a good swing on it. Bam! And crack my ass. He'd beat me an average of about twice a week for not doing this, not mowing the lawn right, this or that, I'm a retarded person, you know, any excuse he could find to beat me, he would beat me. Do you think your dad feels responsible in some way? No. I think he absolved himself of all of it. Because, you know, my dad's a sicko. He designed bombs for the Vietnam War that tortured and killed people. He helped design, what they called a Bouncing Napalm Bomb, which is a spinning bomb. They shoot it out of B52, and it goes down right through the tree line, and it spins and drops off canisters of napalm. So for a five mile stretch, it blows like in "Apocalypse Now". My dad designed that motherfucker. El's just like, you know... He's everything that is my dad's worst nightmare, and that's kind of great, too. My dad needs that karma. He does. My dad is demented, sick, warped and retarded. I'm normal. So, you do love your family? Yeah, I love my family. Who doesn't? Do you go home at Christmas? Nope, not this year, because my dad told me to get lost and never come back, and I said, "You got your wish. "I'm going to dance on your grave when you get cancer!" Bleurgh! Alright, come on. since you're helping me move it. Yeah, one more thing to get up. Wait till you see my drum set! [Conversation continues indistinctly] Hey, I didn't see you on... I missed you on "General High School". Oh, I'm going to be on on August 7th. - August 7th. - Yeah, one more show. What are you bringing to set the pace? A Walkman with about 200 cassettes and an amplifier and a couple of pairs of socks and underwear, and that's it. Hey, look at that, there's plenty of room in here. You can fit how many people in here with the equipment? We're going to take six people, and the amps back there, and the drums on top of the amps, so it looks like pretty good shape. I think we've got enough room for everybody. What's the farthest East you go? New York City. Where are you going to play in New York? - The Ritz. - Really? Yeah. No. No, I think this one's under control. Are those tools? I got a phone number for tools. - Here's your hood, Sneaky. - Yeesh! [El Duce] I got a phone number for a guy that's really good. Don't leave home without it. So everything else you have you're just going to leave here when you leave the road huh? Yeah, more or less. - Can we get... You think... - [El Duce mumbling] you think Sneaky Spermshooter will throw it all away when he realizes you left without him? Oh, yeah, he's going to be damn pissed. So you just sneak in and tell him you are just taking the stuff for a minute, - and you see him tomorrow, huh? - Yeah. [Laughs] But you guys are gonna be in St. Louis - and he's gonna be here, huh? - Right. [Laughing] I'm sitting there looking at him, sitting out in the electric car waiting on... So, uh... we were going to kick him out of the band anyway right before the tour, this last tour we did with the Revolting Cocks, but we didn't know how we were going to tell him. and then, uh... luckily he was so gone towards the end, that he just up and died, killed himself, shooting up dope, speedballs, and... so that was a big load off our shoulders. I liked that guy, Ed. Well, I didn't really like Ed. He was kind of a... Sneaky Spermshooter, you know? - Yeah, he's dead. - He's not dead, is he? - Swear to God, he's dead. - No way. He's dead. - You swear? - I swear to God. - Who told you that, Ed? - I know he's dead. How do you know he's dead? Ed didn't tell me he's dead, no. Did you feel, I know you kind of skirted around, so... Well, see, I was bummed out because I lost my pad. And I lost a lot of clothes, my color TV, my espresso coffee maker, my popcorn, hot air popcorn popper. I don't wish that on anybody, but, you know, he was a little bit of a... I mean if he's dead, he was an alright guy. [♪ Music playing] [♪ Music stops] [Crowd cheers] [Indistinct announcement] [♪ Music resumes] [♪ Music plays] [♪ Music stops] The way the band's set up, there's so much infighting going on, so much personal stuff, that I don't think the band has got what it takes to totally go to the top. I just don't see that happening. And so what drives you then is just your enjoyment of playing music, you know, just doing it, and you have to enjoy doing it just for the sake of doing it. ♪ Heterosexuals have the right to rock ♪ Heterosexuals have the right to rock... ♪ He comes down pretty hard and is pretty anti-homosexual and such very terrible things. Well, you got to understand, the appeal of The Mentors in a lot of ways is very juvenile, and it's sort of a male bonding thing, a thing that 16-year-olds can get together and listen to and set themselves apart from all their friends by being into this band, The Mentors, and... As you know 16-year-old males in general are very homophobic, and I think that's where it comes from, you know. He's not the kind of guy to go out and "fag bash" or anything like that, it's just part and parcel of the whole Mentors package that these things come into the music. Yeah. - Do you like that guitar sound? - Yeah. AJ. Go get fucked up! AJ. I like the devil hearts. Thanks, man. What's up, man? Alright, kid? Get that hood on right. [Woman] It's not... You're nobody to look up to. I'll tell you right now where you're going. Your next gig was going to be where? This White Power movement thing. See, there's a lot of these fanatics down at Huntington Beach that want to... They want The Mentors to play there. But I don't know, I got a lot of black friends, too, you know. I... I got... Living in LA, you got all kinds of friends, you know. I got Chinese friends and Mexican friends... You know, it wouldn't look right for me to go down there and play for a bunch of... a limited amount of people that don't think too deeply. Why do you, uh... I mean I believe that whites have rights, you know, and if there's a black movement, there should be a white movement. I'm proud of being a white. When I become sheriff of this county, I'll be like Buford Pusser. I'm going to be the strongest. I'm a Klansman, I'm a redneck, hallelujah! And I'm going to get them, and you know what? When I become sheriff of this county... I'm going to carry a bat so big it's going to have spikes sticking of the sides. and then when they see me coming with my Nazi German helmet, the crack dealers are going to spread like ants. But to tell you the truth... I'm American all the way. All liberals must die. Why? They stand up for gangs and wars and literacy and... How the hell do they expect to... That calls for a drink. I like him because he's a Nazi. So you agree with both the liberals and the conservatives? What do you think of that? I think it's a pile of crap, we're already overpopulated. What are they going to feed them? Alfalfa leaves and welfare stamps? What's that? They don't want to pay us, but if they want us that bad, they'll have to pay us 150 bucks and a keg of beer. As far as El Duce's sort of philosophy on Nazism and homosexuals... Oh, he picked that up from a friend. I think he picked that up from a friend of his a while back. That's just something he's latched on to just to be offensive. It's not to be taken seriously? No, one of his best friends is as black as your pants. Are you racist at all? No. I got a lot of black friends. Do you think he really idolizes Hitler? Not in a serious sense, I don't think so. Just in terms of the entertainment of it? Yeah, I think he... In terms of the entertainment, yes. But no, he doesn't idolize Hitler, certainly, you know, doesn't read books about Hitler, nor have pictures of Hitler up on his wall or anything. Your dad beat you, and you resented that and you hated that, and yet people like Hitler and Idi Amin, brutalize and torture people, and you like that. - Yeah, I do. - How do you justify that? Because it's entertainment, and I've finally grown up to realize what a fun party he is. Did you think it was entertainment when your dad was beating you? Oh, yeah, he got a kick out of it. You didn't, though? Hell no, I was a victim of it. You know what it's like to be the victim, how come you like the idea of it? Because you grow up, and now I'm going to do it to somebody else, cos my dad did it to me. Is that fair to the person you do it to, though? Hell no, he's going to learn how to do it to the next victim. [Laughs] It's a chain reaction, brother. [Laughs] [Blows raspberry] Mom, if it were only you and El Duce in the room together, what do you want to just say to him? You know what you're doing to kids? Do you realize that you're making boys think that they can go out and do this to girls, and take their innocence away when they don't want it taken away? Well, girls shouldn't go out there advertising for it. No, I'm sorry, I wasn't advertising for it, I was only 12 years old. This dive is where The Mentors started from. They threw me out of here because Stoney T said I set fire to the dumpster. Let me tell you I'm going to buy this club and fire everybody. But these guys are my friends. That's right, brother. - Eldon! - Yeah, what's up there, buddy? How are you doin'? This is El Duce. I named my dog after him. "I named my dog after him!" - What? - I named my dog after him. I'm your fucking wife, asshole. [Indistinct chattering] Good to see you. OK. Big stash. There you go. Thanks for welfare. And then, see, he works part-time for me now, so he'll help me in my business. So we got this mutual thing going there. What do you do? I do private parties. I'm an entertainer, too, and he's... He comes a lot, he carries my shit in and out, cos I go do private parties in people's houses, he carries the shit in and out for me. What kind of work do you do? I paint apartments, do some plumbing. [Belches] Movie extra work. well, that sounds pretty bad. Well, it's not good news. But it's better than the gas chamber. How many 40 ounces do you drink a day? I don't know, about two or three, sometimes four, sometimes six, sometimes eight. How many before you pass out? Probably around six. Do you pretty much pass out every night? No, I'm... Some nights I don't even sleep. How is, uh... Has El Duce's alcoholism ever affected shows? I mean, I love being in the band and everything, but it's affected the band to such a degree that probably only 50% of the shows we're gonna do are gonna be any good, just due to the fact of the alcohol problem. I mean there's been more shows than I could count where he's been so out of it that he literally could not even play, barely even talk. He's even gotten sloppy on his drums, I mean there's another side of... he just cruises. This lyric shit is the same variations of the same crap. He's lazy about that, he can't even write lyrics anymore, he just goes and improvises recordings and everything. [♪ Music playing] [Smacking] [Blows raspberry] [Blows raspberry] [Smacking] So that has been extremely detrimental, now of course there has been lot of times when it's been humorous... [Laughs] El Duce might get mad about this one, but this one place in Florida where he was frying... I'm going to fucking get in the ring, and I'm gonna... Ooh! Yeah. Maybe I'm gonna be a wrestler. The Billygoat! Everybody thought he was talking to somebody, like, "Who is he talking to?" This was, like, four hours' talking, you know, all this shit, like the wrestling guys in WWE? Doing all that shit for four hours, and finally I got up to see who he was talking to, and he's talking in the mirror. He'd say stuff about, "Yeah, I'm gonna kick this guy's ass." You know, he's doing all... [Laughs] That was really funny. [Roars] I'm going to take on anyone, I'll lose the match, who cares? I'll get the chicks and the money afterwards. Do you feel that the band kind of keeps him from getting clean? Uh... Well no, no, I don't think so, I don't think so. I mean, to a certain extent his persona of El Duce is being, you know, this rock and roll party animal. Sure, that reinforces that behavior to a certain extent. But to point to any one thing and say, "That's why he's the way he is," or "If he wasn't doing that, he wouldn't be drinking," I don't think one can make those statements or assumptions. I think alcoholism is a very tricky thing and certainly there's millions of alcoholics in the world who aren't in rock bands, you know, your doctors, lawyers, truck drivers... Drug abuse and alcoholism, they're chronic endemic problems with people, and it's not necessarily attributed to any one thing or any two or three things. I started messing around with Vodka 100 Proof Smirnoff, the blue bottles, and I was drinking that shit, a fifth a day, and that just tears your shit right up. Your shit is gone within a month. You know, drinking that stiff. Cos I thought I was Superman, I could do anything, you know. And then I woke up in the hospital, tubes stuck in my arms and stuff, and I was like, "I got to do something." They gave me all these knock-out pills and shit, so that I could kick the booze. And then I drifted back into drinking, but now all I drink is... Cos I can kind of control it. You know, having grown up with the guy, being a close friend and everything, nobody wants to see somebody they know destroy themselves in that way, but you know... You now, I kind of, to a certain extent, wash my hands of it. I sort of made my attempt to get him clean, it didn't really work, and, uh... I just let him live his own life now. Whatever he's going to do, he's going to do. I can't assume any responsibility for him in terms of his own personal wellbeing. When do you feel bad for him? When I see him, like, with a bottle, half of a bottle of vodka in his hand. And he just wants to be duced, cos I know that thought, I have been there, too. And it's just... I don't want to go back there anymore. And he's... It took such incredible will for me to get out of that, and I don't think... I mean, I know Eldon doesn't have that will. He doesn't even have the will to, you know, get a regular place to stay, and clothes and shower, and that's too much responsibility. You have to be so determined in mind, and he just isn't. So, where do you live? Well, it depends on my attitude. Either jail, cardboard condominium, Sickie Wifebeater's, Dr. Heathen Scum's. I do the couch tour. Um... It's like being on the road. But I'm on the road in one little area. It makes me a nervous wreck. Makes me want to drink more. I'm going to show you how real kings live. Who needs a job? You do. Who needs the booze? I do. Who's an asshole? You are. Who's a creep? I am. Let's get out a dictionary and write down the words. It's funny how you find your real friends. Last I saw him, he was living in a box. Oh, yeah! He was living in a box on the side of the highway in LA. We got to Hollywood, and we pulled over, I mean we're, like, sitting in this parking lot in our bus, and all of a sudden we hear this... There's this empty, deserted, like, broken-down cube truck, and we hear this... [Growling] And then we look over there, and this whole refrigerator box falls out of the back, and El Duce comes crawling out of it. And he looks up and he goes, "Gwar?" See you, brother. You wouldn't be able to spare a nickel? Spare what? You wouldn't be able to spare a nickel, could you? Nickel, what is that? A quarter. Oh, you mean money? What are you going to do with that nickel, man? You are going to do what? Buy booze. - Booze? - Yeah. Hey, Thirty... How do we make money? I bum. Yeah, but how to be a perfect bum? [Man] Eldon Hoke. That man's, like, true terror, left and right. That guy used to work at the Ivar Theatre. Get over here. What? Tell them what I'd do at the Ivar. Tell them what I'd do at the Ivar. In 1984, he used to work as an announcer at the Ivar Theatre, which was a totally nude burlesque theater. That's where I became an announcer also. Tell them what we did in the light booth. I am not even going to speak such things on camera. Sorry. [Annetta] I mean, I grew up with him, I watched him become El Duce, you know, slowly. I mean, from drawing little chopped off arms and axes and torture scenes in the fourth grade... instead of Bambi pictures and shit. I mean, he's always been real different. Do you get along with her the best of anyone in your family? Yep. I love my sister. She's the only family I got, really. Everyone else is gonna die a gruesome death for their evil. How would you like to die? Uh, maybe a lethal injection or have me a... hmm... parachute without a parachute that doesn't work. Yeah. The expression on their face when they go. Because they think they had everything going together, and then when it's time for them to die, get a good look at them! Argh! He talks a lot about death and dying. How seriously do you take that? Well, you know, he first started coming up with that about ten years ago. He'd start saying stuff like, "I have seen death and I want to die." When he gets really drunk, he'll go off onto this death trip he's got. I guess when he first started coming up with it, I got pretty concerned about it. I thought it was maybe indicative of what was soon to follow. And I'm certainly still worried about him expiring early. I mean, the guy's been a serious alcoholic for 10 or 15 years. Certainly, you know, I don't know how much time he has got left, but, again, I just sort of close my mind to it. I figure my only alternative is to not associate with him. I don't want to do that, I mean... I enjoy being around the guy when he is more or less sober. I like working with him, playing with him. He is a friend of mine, and I think I just have to accept him for what he is, and if part of what he is, is to die early, then so be it, although I don't think anybody wants to see that. Mm... yeah. He is fascinated with people dying and killing and getting hurt and all that, but he seems to be a peaceful guy. Yeah, he's harmless. That's the ironic thing about it, he's totally harmless. Didn't seem like he'd hurt anybody. He wouldn't. He is absolutely nonviolent. Do you mind taking your mask off? [Applause] [Booing] OK, put it back on. I am an ugly motherfucker. I admit it. I don't care anymore. Do you find his problem with alcohol to be inhibiting? No, see that's his own thing. He's always talking about dying early and stuff, and that freaks some people out, but I figure we all got to go at our own pace, and maybe the alcohol is preserving him. [Laughs] - What, uh... - It doesn't bother me. I don't give a fuck what he does. [TV ad] '...the value of your home. 'It's even tax-deductible, so consult your CPA. 'That's 1-800-227-2888.

[Laughs] Having maybe reached the apex of commercial viability with The Mentors, why not now just play a type of music that you have always wanted to play? Well, I think we do, we do play what we want to play. Right now, it's what we want to play. You don't feel the need to go off and, uh... I mean, El Duce doesn't feel the need to find his fusion roots again? - Uh, no. - I'm just getting back to... Yeah, I know what you're saying. I know exactly what you're saying. When we started out, it was contrived to the extent I've already described. But that... we're way past that point now. It's no longer a contrived thing, it's a real legitimate artistic thing that we do, and there's very little pretense behind it of that nature. So I think we are doing what we want to do. I mean, I guess... I think El would've wound up the same way whether or not he was ever in The Mentors. And so I guess I'm glad that, um... he was in The Mentors so he will be remembered for something. El Duce, this is for you. I hope you roll in your fucking grave.
