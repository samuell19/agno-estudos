Katrinebæk. How I love that name. It's like sucking on a piece of candy. Can't you taste it? You're insane. Damn beautiful. Those two silos are darned ugly, though. Like putting a moustache on the Mona Lisa. They were just as expensive as they're ugly. Let's throw a hand grenade at them. How many pigs are we processing now? "We"? We are processing 10,000 per year. Disgusting. Organic, of course? No, that's right... I should've shot you when I had the chance. You don't shoot your commanding officer. Shit, Ernst. Just look at them. Why don't you retire? You're loaded. And Lasse is a musician. He doesn't want to take over. Look at me: a quick trip to Hamburg. Cheap beer. A little lady on my arm. It's not as hunky-dory as you think. Did you see that? He's a boozer, your dad. And you're drunk. Louise has made up a bed for you. You know where it is. Will you marry me? Where shall we put the children? - At the bottom of the bed. - No. THE BUTTERFLY SWING You must have seen it coming, Ernst. - I can't talk now. - We can't grant you an extension... You only just called me the day before yesterday. - Can't we do something? - The bank has talked to the council. - That is out of the question! - It's the only option. I have to go now. Bye. Ernst! Are you coming? ... through happy times and adversity will find that day and night they are getting... - Grumpy this morning, are we? - No. ... that they have really their hearth-flame dearly surpassed with love surpassed with love. Three cheers for our golden anniversary couple, Louise and Ernst. Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! Now kiss each other. No, a real kiss! On the lips. With tongue, Mom. Hurray! - Dear friends... - Vidar, not now. We can't understand your accent anyway. Have a drink. I'll just have one. Who wants a shot? It masks the stench of manure. - We have the smell under control now. - Morning, Dad. Congratulations. Congratulations. - I'm overwhelmed to see you all. - Thank you. You look perky. - Your son doesn't seem to think so. - He has no clue. Uncle Ernst, piggy walk, now. Excuse us. We have our little routine. Piggy walk. See you later. Being on time is hard, eh? Thanks for coming. - Piggy walk. - Yes. I'm allowed. I never see you. - Mom, please. - Excuse me. - As I always say: more booze. - No, coffee and rolls now. - I'm going to be drunk. - More booze! If you shoot a butterfly, a man in China dies. - You don't believe that, do you? - It's true. I call that baby pig Little Butterfly. - The one with the tattoo. - That one is sick, Luna. Please don't shoot it. It's our livelihood, you know? The Chinese want pork as well. Please don't shoot it. It'll bring bad luck. Hardly. Ernst speaking. Someone's sneaking around Enghave Farm. A big Audi. An Audi? I don't know... Just a minute. Luna, go join the others. - I just wanted to let you know. - I don't know what that is about. Hello? Hello? It's you. I thought it was burglars. I had to leave breakfast and the brass band. - I took the liberty... - We already discussed it. I understand. End of story. This is your lifeline, Ernst. We're giving you a great offer. - You'll never sell this pile of shit. - No, but... Lots of empty rooms. You own five other empty farms. Dad would spin in his grave. Grandma as well. I can still whoop your ass even though you're all grown. They don't belong here. We've have enough problems as it is. Now scram. There's nothing to discuss. You're my nephew. I'll try to be cordial tonight but stay away from me and stay quiet. I'm fighting for your loans. I'll be kicked out if you mess up. - Get lost. - I'm trying to help. I never asked for your help! Idiot! Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! Cheers! What happened to you this morning? Why did you run off? I just pottered about the fields and had a look at the winter crop. You should have a look at the long hairs in your ears instead. Aren't you excited about the party? Henning! You were born with dancing shoes on your feet. You bring good cheer. We've always said that when we were expecting you. You will move out here, won't you? When you're old, I mean. Louise, hurry up. - I just love this season. - You love all the seasons. I suppose that's true. Ernst Nielsen is more of a winter fan. Aren't you? You'd never have come this far if he hadn't challenged you, Louise. My lovely, grumpy, stubborn, old fellow. That's cousin Jens in a new car. Seems he just stopped wearing diapers and shat on your new carpet. Looking good! Careful, now. Don't ruin the bank's expensive carpeting. The blacksmith brothers Alf and John. That's you, right? Still collecting unemployment benefits? The party has arrived! How about that, Vidar?! - Want to trash his car? - We have the right tools for it. We would like to ask anyone who wants to get plastered to come inside. - Come on... Stop it, Vidar. Don't... - Hello! Congratulations. - Here you go. A creative gift. - They didn't have any white ones. - Louise has lots of chickens. - This one doesn't require much space. We are happy to see that you're sticking to your principles. We've got to stop the influx, right? All right. Let's party. Ow! - Did she peck at you? - Yes. We'll leave her out here. Idiots. This isn't a kids' party. A goddamn bantam! Hi, brother-in-law. - Let me see. - Enough. - Do you love me? - Stop it. That suit is awful. I don't know how you can stand it. Hi, son. Oh not you, too. - Hi, morons. - Hi, Sis. Come here... Ow! Hi, Maja. Thanks for coming on such short notice. Hans, damn it! - Hans, I'm stuck. - You're way too fat, Mom. Shut up, Luna, and behave yourself just for tonight. Mind the dress. Thank you. Where did the kid go? Luna! Congratulations, Ernst. Just a minute. Oh thanks. What are you wearing? That's right, you've never seen us perform. - But today you're forced to. - And I'm not happy about it. Positive as always. I think Ernst would look good in a red suit. You didn't marry the most cheerful lad on Earth, Mom. Cheers. Damn it... - The old man is in a foul mood. - He's never heard us play. I don't think it would help. Of course he's in a foul mood. He's been married for 50 years. This is like a funeral. The guests are too old to dance. And what else are they too old for? Always bitching, Theis. Speaking of bitches. Your cousin with the big tits... - What's her name? - Stop it. - Seriously. We're working. - Lasse, the choirboy of Theis Tequila. "Lis has just put on clean sheets." "Lis is driving me home. Lis is picking me up..." - Don't you want to try another woman? - Lasse! - Dad, can we talk? - Of course. You're behind the drums. Give me your pants. Wow. Nice. Are you ready? We were born ready. Service Grethe is ill, so Mom asked Maja to help instead. Lærke's mom. Okay. That's fine. Is she here now? That's great. Will you give us a signal when Grandma and Grandpa enter the room? - Great. - Just thought you should know. This one just came. Thanks. Nice, huh? From the bank. You look nice too, Grandpa. From the bank? - Are we that close with the bank? - Apparently. Holgersen, you came. - HI, Henry. - Hello, hello. These are for you, Great-grandpa. You're so nice. - We'll play later. - You bet your bippy, my darling. You talk funny. Got your own driver now, Dad? One day you'll be able to afford it too seeing as you've inflated everything. Ernst? Ernst... What's the matter? - It's nothing. - Rubbish. - Come here. What's wrong? - Nothing. Sit down over here. Sit down. - Have you had this before? - It's nothing. - Can you keep a secret? - Yes, of course. What is it? The bank declared me bankrupt. The day before yesterday. What the hell are you saying? Bankrupt? You've got to be kidding. Holy crap. Louise... What does she have to say about it? She doesn't know. - Let's give her a great night. - Yes, of course. They say all youth parties start with a bang. Mission accomplished. Welcome. That bantam, you know... The guy in the suit. - Does he know? - Yes. - So you're moving to a smaller place? - Ernst and Henning. Are you coming? Just in time, Mom. Are you angry? That thing yesterday... Did you talk to your dad? - You promised. - Not at Grandma and Grandpa's party. - What do we do about it, Christian? - Maybe it'll pass. Pass?! What the fuck is my mom doing here? - They needed one, so my mom asked... - And where do you stand? Welcome, everyone. Ernst and I have really been looking forward to this. You could say we've been looking forward to this for many years. For 50 years. 50 years ago today I stood as a city girl blushing and young... ... very young, in the church with a principled, quiet and stubborn man. But he was also a very handsome and a very lovely man. And he happened to own this big, beautiful farm, Katrinebæk which we love. We love the peace and quiet the smells and the changing seasons. Then we had Lasse, our lovely son and you, dear Lis. And our grandchild, Christian. We wish everyone a great and joyful party. We are celebrating love today. Love and intimacy and not least endurance, right, Ernst? I don't even know if you're supposed to get each other gifts, but... Lærke? Thanks, sweetheart. I bought a sleeping bag for two. It's for you. You may not believe it, but even though we live at the most beautiful farm in the most beautiful surroundings we've always dreamt of going camping in Sweden. And now we're going. Congratulations to the two of us, Ernst. Welcome once again. Enjoy your meal. Promise not to leave the party hungry. Thank you. Come on, Ernst, your turn! Speech! Come on! A speech... Thank you, Louise. I think I will give my speech inside this. - And it will be a great speech. - I can't wait. Thank you, everyone. Cheers. The groom can test the sleeping bag while the rest of you enjoy our brilliant keyboard player Krede. Take it away! - Come here. - I'm going to be late. - What's happening? - I've been calling and calling. - You need to tell me more. - Let me take my coat off. You call and tell me my husband is screwing around. It wasn't very subtle, I know. I just think... What do you think? I saw them by the woods in your car. Together. They were really going at it. - I don't know her, but... - You will. She's waitressing. What? Here? Lis, listen. I don't know exactly... People park there all the time. People get bored. Maybe it's just a fling. Who knows? Go fuck yourself. Ernst Nielsen has a farm with pigs, piggy, piggy, pork. Ernst Nielsen is a strapping guy, piggy, piggy, pork. With an oink-oink here, and an oink-oink there here an oink, there an oink, everywhere an oink-oink. Ernst Nielsen has a farm with pigs, piggy, piggy, pork. Ernst Nielsen has a lovely wife, humpty, humpty, hey. A lovely girl so full of life... Oh, how time flies by. A man with lots of energy, piggy, piggy, pork. With a boom-boom here and a bang-bang there boom-boom, bang-bang, Ernst is going at it. Louise has a lovely guy, handsome, wise and sly. Bravo! Bravo! - There's no room. - You haven't eaten a thing. Oh, it's you. A sleeping bag for two? You're going to need it. Did you tell Louise yet? 30,000 a month. The bank can accept that. The council's paying, and you have the space... One: Mind your own business. Two: You do your job, that's fine. I do mine. - Three: I've taken a stand... - A stand? Some clowns burned half the nursing home down. This could save your ass. Are you really that xenophobic? - It's Lasse's plan... - There is no plan. Keep it to yourselves. Don't tell anyone. You hear me? Your friends are trying to wreck the rescue plan. Good night, Ernst. Tired already? - That's not how I remember you. Tired. - It's just a present, Ruth. I heard. How nice. You hear everything around here. Everything. The food is delicious as always, Ruth. No, no, no! No... We're having a private party. You cannot park here. No. You cannot park here. I don't care. This is a private party. - Good to see you. - What are you up to now? - It's just inside, guys. - Who are those criminals? It's a surprise, Dad. This is the most tone-deaf thing I've ever seen from you. Dad, you're wrong. What's the matter? No need to be so grumpy. Hello. Can I have your attention, please? All right. What do you give your parents for their 50th wedding anniversary? Mom and Dad. The world has become smaller. And music transcends boundaries and touches hearts. You taught me that, Mom. Or it ought to, and my friends here always touch my heart. I give you an international and beautiful musical experience which I hope you'll enjoy. Right, Dad? Be quiet. - Shut up. - No, Frank. Shut up. - Make them stop! It's our party. - Let them sing. It's a present to us, Frank. Stop it! Sit down. You fool. - We had better stop now. - Yes! Thanks to those of you who were kind enough to listen. Congratulations, Mom and Dad. And... now the red meat is being served. - It was beautiful. - Sweetie, thanks. - Sorry about them being assholes! - Good riddance. My God, you're an idiot. - I wonder if we'll get paid. - Sure. There's food for you in a moment. Are you still coming to Copenhagen after graduation? - Easy now. I don't know... - But we agreed. - Have fun. - You're so stupid. Stupid? It's over, stepbrother. Lærke, let's talk about it. What did the substitute teacher call you? A boxhead. You're such a boxhead. Cheers. Cheers! On your feet! Was it you?! - Geez, Luna! - It's Luna. You're impossible! I don't know where you get it from. Now stay put there and you'll get some dessert later. Hey there, Lasse boy. What's up, cousin? Not a smart move, those... singing... I don't know where the heck they're from. - Did you talk to my dad? - Talk? I've yelled my lungs out. It's a no go. - It's a damn smart solution. - We have to talk to my mom. Not today, of course, but soon. I gotta get back inside. What a nice surprise. It's so wrong for me to be here. I mean, why? - Was it your idea? - No, Lis's. - Are you okay? - No. It's nice of you to help out. You look gorgeous. Not here! Shit! It's better than Noma. They don't make this there. Listen up. Right... Pig farmers only get bigger. Not you, Louise. You keep fit. No, "bigger" as in land purchases. Gotta feed those pigs, right? But what about all the empty farms, Ernst? There's no life left anywhere. Yeah right, but some of us enjoy the benefits of it because what do we do at the empty Enghave Farm on a Wednesday night? You're about to find out. - Hi, Ruth. - Hi. The food's delicious. - And this is the dessert? - Well, what do you think? I think Christian's girlfriend's mom should serve Ernst and Louise's cake. The one with all the flags. It's so nice of her to help out. Okay. Keep up the good work. Cyprus was a safer place when Ernst and I left the island in 1972. Two handsome fellows if I do say so myself. In blue berets... We called them elephant diaphragms. And... well, I'm sorry, Louise. But... many Cypriot women had trouble sleeping when Ernst, the handsome soldier, roamed the streets. Handsome, muscular... And charming. I'll say! And virile. And well-hung. More wine. You'll feel it if you dance close with him tonight. No, no, no! Dear Ernst. Thank you for our long and faithful friendship. And you, Louise. Joy. That ought to be your name. What is joy? Is it a big, beautiful farm? I don't think so. Joy is having someone like you, Louise. A wonderful woman whose embrace is a haven, when... Well, when age takes its toll. When you hit the wall, as they say. When your strength and drive fail you. Ernst, damn it. You still have Louise. A wonderful wife. When you no longer need to expand and build, build, build! And build and build and build! Congratulations to the both of you. Farmers are pigs! Ernst fucked me when I was 17. And here I am waiting on them. Good grief! But he really was handsome. - Your cousin, what's her name? - Lene. Men are a bunch of pigs! I totally agree. Wimps and boxheads. Boxheads? What do you mean? - Christian is lovely. - Lovely. Fuck if I care. Dear golden couple. Dear Ernst. We know you didn't burn down the refugee center at the old nursing home. Not that you didn't want to. But your ever-dedicated input your sound stances, your courage... Damned impressive, Ernst! Impressive. You're not obliged to gather the threads. - I don't know if I should say this... - Yes! It's a huge sacrifice, and we're damned proud of you. Ernst, it's no secret, and I'm sure you and Louise have talked it over, so... Oh no! What's going on? Haven't they been kicked out yet? Louise doesn't know anything, so keep your mouth shut. Enjoy the party. Oh, there's the little Talibang! We've made a little bed for you here. Sleep tight! Oh my God. Turn off the lighter. Go back. Now's not the time. Ernst, leave it and come back. Vidar... oh, come on! Your new friend, Frank, what did he mean when he said we'd talked it over? - I have no idea. - Speak up! Ernst, this song is mainly for you from your old hunting buddies. We're living in a godless country. And godless times. The Lord have mercy on us. But here... Here is where the heart is, and here we stick together. Congratulations, Louise and Ernst. Hardworking Christians. - I don't understand his accent. - God sees you! - God sees you. - Oh, he's invited, too? He's right here! A farmer born and bred, his wife keeps the homestead. His wife keeps the homestead and she keeps the farmer fed. An enterprising man, his farm he must expand. His farm he must expand, he's a proud bull of a man. Louise is his rock... Have you seen them? You want women to be housekeepers. Fucking chauvinist song! - It's just for fun. - You're all sick. Hurray, hurray, hurray! Your wife's a busy bee, her pork roast is heavenly. her pork roast is heavenly, there's enough for you and me. - Oh cut it out! - Hillbillies! And what's wrong with that? Louise plucks the poultry, we eat it happily. We wash it down with beer and a dram for good cheer. We'll see to it no harm befalls Katrinebæk Farm. Hurray, hurray, hurray! Here comes the tribute verse, so put away the snouts. You're serving up a feast for each and every guest. And each and every guest thanks you both for such a feast. And with a bit of luck we'll shoot ourselves a duck. We'll shoot ourselves a duck without shooting some poor schmuck. We thank you for the meal and for such a lovely do. We tip our hats in thanks and we raise our glass to you. Let's all stand up and cheer and shout a loud hurray. Hurray, hurray, hurray! Cheers! In a lovely garden filled with sunny droplets and the scent of lilies roses, violets. There I met... It's the little piggy's song. Let's go and play with it soon. Sure... Or we could do something else? No? Lift it up. Little butterfly... Come along! Go find somewhere to sleep. Here comes the dessert! Oh dear, clumsy me. Well... Congratulations to the couple, who... ... provided me with... ... my hubby up there with the guitar. Lasse. That's my husband, Lasse. - Cheers. - Cheers. This white wine is really good by the way. We like that, don't we, here in our little piece of heaven? The wind in our hair and the woods and the beach... But... let's get down to it. Dear you two, whom I'm very fond of. Everything's great. What a... wonderful party... But he's always been spoiled rotten. So sweet. And... I'm sorry, Louise, but... ... you talked about fidelity and intimacy. Well, I guess it skips a generation. You never know. But... Cheers. That cake is not going anywhere. Yes, well... Oh my. What a shame. Well... Apart from that I just want to say to the two of you... I'm very fond of you and... ... this is such a lovely party with wonderful people. And I'd just like to say thank you and godspeed. Let's toast the silver... no, golden couple. Cheers. More white wine. No, you're staying here. Let them deal with it themselves. Lis. Are you okay? Okay? Christ, Lis, what's going on? Lis. Calm down. Easy now, Lis. - What's going on? - Yeah, what the fuck's going on? You're my damned husband and you're screwing around. - Nonsense. - Nonsense! You're fucking that bitch in our car. Aren't you? - It's nothing, honey. - Don't honey me! Nothing? It's our entire life! Don't believe everything... You're such a liar! I saw you before. I bet you've fucked anything with a pulse on your little concert tours. Not tonight. Pull yourself together. It's my parents' golden anniversary. I can't... I have to go play. - You're finished, right? Out! - No, no, no. Please sit, it's fine. What the fuck are you doing? - Do you need anything? Coffee? - I doubt your dad agrees. Keep my dad out of this and mind your own business. Listen. You guys were great. I thought it was great, but these guys were just acting stupid. What did you say? I called you stupid and rude, which you were. - You smug bastard. - This was my present for my parents. Okay? Sit down. Be seated. But the three of you... You disgust me. Seriously, you disgust me, Frank. Did you hire those monkeys to provoke your dad? What are they doing here? - What did your dad ever do to you... - Nice guests, Dad. - Is there no end to your provocations? - Provocations? Yes. Are you serious, Dad? Shame on you all. Spare us your leftist nonsense just for tonight! Get out! - Come on. - Sorry, guys. Sorry, guys. Thank you. I thought it was great. Bye. You're an embarrassment. What are you so afraid of? The little accordion guy in front of your DIY store? Does he scare you? You're pathetic. And you, Dad?! - Keep it down! - Dad, get back to work. - Thank you. - No thanks! Come. It's the bridal dance. So you managed to squeeze in a quarrel with our son? Go at it, Ernst. Should I feel if Henning was telling the truth? That's not funny. About that thing out there... Where do you think you're going? - I don't owe you an explanation. - You're staying right here. - What's going on? - You tell me! Did you even think of Christian and me? You're ruining everything, you home wrecker. - You're a whore. - What?! What are you saying? We're not stupid. You're fooling around with Christian's dad. - Stay out of it. - You're fucking my boyfriend's dad! You just got dragged through your own shit. - Lis said they were desperate... - Desperate! You're so fucking naive! - I'm sorry, sweetie. It just happened. - It just happened? You're an adult. Didn't you think it would fuck everything up? - Yes... - So why the fuck did you do it? Because I haven't felt this way since Dad moved away. Look, we fell in love... In love. Shit, that's lame. Sweetie, I would never do anything to hurt you and Christian. Okay? I'd never do that. - He just came over... - No details, thank you. You can't just take off. You're staying here and helping out. And break it off with Lasse. Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Bastard... he's a bastard. Who, Lasse? Yes. And Maja, that waitress slut. Oh, the girl with the sizzling cake? Was that your doing? Karen sells party novelties, you know? I spent the entire afternoon putting extra powder in the sparkler. But you're insane, Sis. - What a shitty party. - There now. Come on. On your feet. Up you go, up you go. I want to go home! Sis, they're serving the soup soon. You love soup. You'll feel better. - Get back in the saddle now. - It's my own fault. I drove him into the arms of that bitch. I'm such an idiot. Here you go. Stick out your boobs and get back into the game. - That's the spirit. - Come on. There now, Sis. We'll have a chat with him. This one is for you, Louise. Lasse may not know a thing about pigs, but he sure can write songs. This one actually made the charts. And guess who his inspiration was. Let's get a chain dance going. Is Madame's dance card full? Is Madame's dance card full? - May I have this dance, Louise? - Of course, Jens. Ernst, you need some fresh air. We'll dance later. This is our dance. Go have a glass, Ernst. - No, no, no. - It'll help you think. Find herself a toy boy, did she? - You're a mess. - Everything's a mess. Let's dance. Come on. You have a straw in your silvery hair, Louise. - Come back, okay? - I promise. In a hay stack you always want to show that you can roll. Come, Louise, and roll along with me. My arms are made for squeezing, let me see your smile again. I will give you just ten seconds, so I'm gonna count to ten. All together now! One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten! And then Louise came, she took my hand and said, let's go. I was chosen by Louise all those many years ago. She's grown a little fleshy, but she's still so cute and sexy. And today she's even still got that straw in her hair. Ernst. Ernst! Intimacy. Whatever happened to that? I see. I saw Jens whispering to you. And no, it doesn't look good. Bankrupt, and half the town knows about it. We should have canceled this party. But we have lots to celebrate. We're bankrupt. Why didn't you tell me? - Well? - What good would that do? What do you mean? The costs got out of hand, but it's my department. I'm the one putting in all the hard work. You... you just go around singing. I just go around singing? How dare you?! Well? I married a stubborn stick-in-the-mud and keep a huge house and garden. You never let me into your grumbling building binge. I've worked like a madman! - And you didn't mind us growing. - Fine, put the blame on me. Are we really going to be evicted? That's what the bank says. Jens says we can rent out the empty farms. - Did he try to sell you that hogwash? - Hogwash? We don't use them. - And doesn't Lasse get a say? - Lasse? - He doesn't care about Katrinebæk! - That's not true. - I can't be bothered with this now. - You can't be bothered? What's the matter with you? It's pathetic that we're being uprooted because of your bigotry. You quarrel with Lasse, and things between him and Lis seem to be bad. Everything's a mess, and now we all have to suffer under your stupid principles! - Stop it! - You stop it! We have loads of space! And we can't sell the farms. So let's turn Katrinebæk into a refugee camp and have the monkeys running around on my fields? Hell no! Your fields? You mean our fields. They're my fields, too! What has happened to you, Ernst? - How did you get to be so misanthropic? - Misanthropic? What are you thinking? Can't you see we're being flooded? I can't handle this... Maybe not, but we're not done! You're a bitter, stupid and stubborn... I can't stand the sight of you! You've ruined my evening! I'm going in smiling. Did you know? Yes. Ernst just told me. Has he completely lost his mind? Sure. I thought you knew that. - Coffee? - Thank you, dear. And perhaps two will be three by next year. Would you like to dance? I'd rather not. I hear you loud and clear. Oh dear. Oh? Once wasn't enough? The floor sure gets clean today. You're the loveliest... Crap song! A bottle of red wine as the prize keeps everyone on their toes. You shouldn't aim at anything when it's loaded. There's a party going on, darling. Let's go to the party. It's hot in here, Uncle Ernst. Can we go say goodnight to Little Butterfly? It's sleeping. Lærke says everyone bangs everyone out here. Such a beautiful woman. So sad. - So melancholic. - Yes. A quiet dance to the next slow song would help. But perhaps a little drink first. What? - You want to drink something first? - Yes. Luna, if anyone asks, we just went to check up on the pigs. Okay? We just went to check on the pigs! Okay? I took her to the movies, and off we go she was so cute, my heart soon sang O Sole Mio. She got the biggest bowl of popcorn and was ready for it all. I was hot and all excited, I knew it was my call. Did you hear that Niels at Lykke Farm let in the Pakis? You're pissing on my shoes. Lærke, will you please hand these out? You're such a boxhead. Thanks for the drink. It's a greeting from the book club. It's nice that they can read, but they must be deaf. What the hell? Get the fuck out! Get out! Shut the damn door! - Shut the door! - Where's Lasse? Shut the door, hillbilly... Hey, hey! Goddammit! Calm down, goddammit! He's the lead singer! He's the singer! - I'm sorry. - Stop! - Why the hell did you hit him? - He can still sing, can't he? What happened to you? - I just took a beating for you. - For me? Yeah, I don't get beaten up for fucking your cousin. It was the moron, your brother-in-law. - Yeah, it's because of me and Lis. - I kinda figured. And your cousin took off. Too bad, she was a shitload of fun. - So Lene took off... - Yep. She's quite something to get off on. Ladies and gentlemen, time to move to the "Knight of Sin". Hi, Lulu my curvaceous cutie. You think the box of love is missing a screwie. Take me in bed, make me crazy wild. Are you waiting for me to take you on a ride? You're a stupid bitch. You know that, right? Right? Let me just put this down... - No! Lis, don't... - I'll start by tearing your eyes out. Stop it. - Can't you hold on to your own man? - Let's talk about it later like adults. Adults?! Do you hear yourself?! - Stop! Stop it now! - No! Stop it! Leave my Mom alone! Leave my Mom alone, Lis. Come on. I'm your knight of sin! Someone forgot a gift in the bathroom! Sweetie... We never got to say goodnight to the Little Butterfly pig at your farm. You didn't? Were you there just now? What is it? Why don't you have a chat with Henry? If you're too tired to dance, go to the bar while the rest of us shake a leg... Come. Where are we going? I know that marriage is one big compromise. But to think that you'd just leave me. Bang! The end to your problems. - But... - I never expected that. Shut up. Luna told me. To lose face, is that what you're afraid of? Losing face? I know you, Ernst. I know you're moody, but this! Jesus, you're a cowardly bastard! - Louise, I'm sorry. - Coward! Louise, I'm sorry. Louise... If our lives are coming to a halt, we're going to do it in style! How long has it been since you touched me? Exactly. Huh? No... sorry. Come here. Hey! Scoot over. I'll drive. You're not driving! - Go back to the party! - No! Get out. It'll find its way home! Stop that! - You can't drive! - Get out! Go! - Easy now... - Sis! Stop... Lis, stop! - Lasse... - Easy, you two! Hey, stop it! Lis... Are you in love with her? Yes. Yes, I am. I'm so sorry, Lis. I'm sorry it had to be like this. - Come on out. - No. Get out. Okay? Get out. Go on. All the way out. Lis'll get home okay. But you're an asshole. Yeah. What the hell are you all laughing at? The wheel is all bent out of shape. She wrecked the whole side! Fuck, man! Don't you have insurance? You two... You two! - Blacksmiths! - You could've studied, too. - Go back in, Jens. - Fucking asshole! Isn't it more fun to run off with me? - It'll cost a fortune, man! - Go on inside. - Go inside, Jens! - What a shitty atmosphere, man! Would everyone come closer? So, here you are with empty paper plates. Not exactly characteristic for tonight thanks to you, Grandma and Grandpa. Old love, which we're celebrating here, isn't something I've experienced yet but hopefully I will. Your intimacy has always been palpable and the stubbornness has come up numerous times tonight. But stubbornness can also wear you down. I'm your only grandchild and I find that a bit lazy. I thought you went hard at it out here. But now, we'll go on a field trip. We'll go out into the night. Because I find the quiet out here the most beautiful thing. So if you'll all put the plates on your ears, just put your ear in the hole. - Here you go. - That's right. And if you'll all go outside. Have you seen them in there? Damn morons. Listen to the nightingale. To you, my wonderful grandma. I remember you singing in the cellar. You have been a great musical inspiration to my dad. And I know that a great voice was lost in you. Under brightly colored lanterns I'm dancing close to you. And the full blue moon is lighting up the park. Beautiful, Louise! Go, girl! And this area also offers up other funny sounds. Such as when wise and accommodating farmers talk to their underlings. No! Put it down! You're not in charge! That's not up to you! I don't know how many boots I've worn down following you around. But I've seen how hard you've worked, Grandpa. Like when the roof flew off the barn. Or when we took my toy excavator to the hill because you said we needed to dig up a Viking ship. You wanted us to hold on to our history. And there's something to hold on to. Something to live up to. I don't agree with all that you do, but I'd like to thank you. To thank both of you. I'm ready to take you in when the day comes for me to take over Katrinebæk. All right, Christian! Beautiful, Christian! Thank you, sweetie. Congratulations, Grandpa. Lærke. - You leave just like that? - It looks that way. It seems my fella has decided to stay put. Can't we work this out? I'm crazy about you. For God's sake, don't you get it? My mom and your dad! - Where are you going? - Take a wild guess. And if you hit the roof, it's gonna be rough. The flying saucers, the flying saucers are about to take off! We're going to call it a night now. You've been a great audience. Are you taking a piss? Anything wrong, Christian? - Is Mom okay? - Yes, she called from home. But the car's a wreck. - What did you tell those two? - You know... First I whipped out some leftovers. They had grave faces but then I surprised them. Roast beef and chicken salad. I told them the car drove into the ditch... before the party. They asked more questions, but then I slammed the chicken salad on the table. What about your girlfriend? - The little pretty one? - It's not good. She's gone. Launch a surprise attack. How hard can it be? - You're young and handsome. - The chicken salad won't save this one. So think up something else. She called you a boxhead. Prove her wrong. Ernst, goddammit, the most principled man of the area. I hear you stuck your nose in the business with our empty farms. I just said what we all thought, Ernst. Get home safe. Thanks for a great night. You left the party. Did you talk? - Not a whole lot. - Good for you. You have a straw in your silvery hair, Louise... - Isn't that Grandpa's sleeping bag? - I promised to break it in. You really are a hillbilly. I thought I was a boxhead. He promised! Yes, yes. That's right. Okay, there, there. Welcome. Welcome. - There. - Bigger wings. - Bigger than this? - If they're too small, it can't fly. Could we... could we... Yes. Yeah, more. Oh, we have guests. - Good luck, Little Butterfly. - You're a chatterbox. - And you're a pig murderer. - You're a very tough employer. That's not funny. Out you go. Welcome. Hello. - Hello. Welcome. - Hello. Welcome. Welcome.
