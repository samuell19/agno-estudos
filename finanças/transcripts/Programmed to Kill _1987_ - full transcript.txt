(bright music) (ominous music) - Alexander The Great came to this beautiful island 2000 years ago. You know who was Alexander? No? I will tell you. Alexander the Great was a very great man. He conquered parts of the world. He made very beautiful buildings, (indistinct) from the gods and works of art. (guide speaking in foreign language) (lively music) (man shouting in foreign language) (bus honks) (lively music) (ominous music) (guns firing rapidly) (crowd screaming) (guns firing rapidly) (grenade explodes) (people screaming) (guns firing) (man speaking in foreign language) - [Reporter] Good evening, our top story tonight. Terrorists have attacked a marketplace in Mes Creek today, killing 24 and wounding over 50. Two American children have reportedly been taken hostage. Their identities are as yet unknown. A PLO splinter group known as the United Freedom Fighters has claimed responsibility for the attack. Their leaders, Hassim Nair, and American ex-Patriots, Samira Assad, have been linked to two terrorists bombings earlier this year. A spokesman for the State Department indicates there's been no communication as yet from the terrorists. - [Donovan] What are their demands? - Release of political prisoners, Recognition of their organization and a worldwide press conference to condemn the policies of the United States. - So what's new? - The same old shit. Let every third world terrorist bring us to our knees. - What operatives do we have available? - So, what about Eric Matthews? He's in that part of the Mediterranean. I think he's our best shot. - Matthews? You've gotta be kidding me? - He's in the area and he'll get the job done. He's never failed us. - No way. Matthews and his group of mercenaries can't be trusted. It's as simple as that. Who knows who the hell he's working for now? - All right, do it. We don't have time to argue. Get Matthews. - Thank you, sir. You won't be sorry. I'll make all the necessary arrangements and I'll contact Matthews. - Blake, you and Bob get that Cybertron project of yours finished or I'm pulling the plug. - [Chris] Eric, you got a call! - What? - Eric, hurry up. It's important. - Yeah? - Code one, Retaliator. This is code 104. Well, I'm glad to hear from you. You keeping outta trouble? - Yeah, sure. As long as I keep away from government work, I'm fine. Working for you people can get a guy killed. - Eric, let's let bygones be bygones. I have something you may just be interested in. - That's funny. I heard I was being phased out. - Now, Eric, you know that I didn't have anything to do with them trying to replace you. In any case, the agency needs your help and this time it's a big one. I think we finally got Hassim. - Where? - Outside Beirut. He's got two American hostages. Both children. - I want no government interference. - You got my word. Pouch is on the way with the usual fee. And Eric ... It's good to have you back. - Right. - [Chris] What's up? - You know, Christopher, it looks like we're going back to work for Uncle Sam. We're going after Hassim. - Hassim? Bitchin'. - Yeah. (oriental music) - Coffee? - Thank you. - This is terrible. - Give it back! - Oh, come on. I was joking. - Thank you, dear. - You're welcome. (man speaking in foreign language) - Mind your own business. (man speaking in foreign language) - Hello, little pigs. How do you like it here? It stinks, eh? - Yeah, it stinks. Just like you. - Big mouse. American little pigs. - Listen, mister, the marines will take care of you. - The American soldiers are scared. They would never come here again. - Oh yeah, you wait and see. - What? You'll wait and see. And you wait and wait and wait and wait. (man laughing) (mysterious music) (boat engine whirring) (man speaking in foreign language) Hurry up! - Come on! Go, go! (truck engine running) (suspenseful music) (guns loading) (truck engine roaring) (knocking on roof) - Eric, there is a checkpoint. I see two guards. If I whistle, get ready to shoot. (guard speaking in foreign language) - Got cigarette? (suspenseful music) (guard speaking in foreign language) (knocking on roof) (truck engine whirring) (suspenseful music) (rifle fires) (suspenseful music) (gun fires) Get Hassim! (gun firing) (guns firing) Move it out, move it out! - Americans. - [Eric] Go look for the kids. (guns firing) - Eric, I've got Samira over here. She's over here! (gun fires) (gun fires) - Hey, Eric. Hassim has escaped. - Shit. Move it! Let's go! We'll take her with us. (guns firing) (suspenseful music) (gun fires) (kids yell) I'm taking you home. Let's go. (suspenseful music) (guns firing) Eat this, asshole. (grenade explodes) (truck engine running) (dramatic music) (guard speaking in foreign language) (suspenseful music) - See you next time, Eric. - Thanks for the help. - Come on, let's move! Bring the other one, come on. Come on, get in. (suspenseful music) (Eric yells) (tense music) (boat engine roaring) - Gonna trip over that skateboard. What's happened? - Eric's been hurt. - Where is he? - At the clinic. He'll be okay, but I think it'd be a good idea for you and Jason were with him. - I'll get my car. - What's her temperature? - 26C and falling. Prepare the sump for introduction. - Suture. - What's going on? - We've lost return to the oxygen meter. - Temperature at 25C. - Clamp! - You're losing her. - 25 CC's, cardioplegic solution. Now! - [Receptionist] Dr. Diamont to ICU stat. Dr. Diamont to ICU stat. - How you doing? Okay- - I got a surprise for you. - Hi, dad. - How you doing? - It's gonna be all right? - Better than ever. - Ow, ow, ow. It's okay. Hello, Sharon. I wanna thank you for coming by, Ned. You've been a good friend. - [Receptionist] Dr. Sarlouie to ER one, stat. Dr. Sarlouie to ER one, stat. - What's the prognosis? - Massive internal bleeding. There's nothing anyone can do for her now. - Is she alive? - For all practical purposes, the woman's brain dead. - I said, is she alive? - You wanna call it that? As long as she's on life support systems. - Look, I don't care how you do it. You just keep her alive, understand? - Yeah. - Good. - [Receptionist] CCU, code blue, room one. CCU, code blue, room one. - That's a nice way to wake up. - You do realize that you fell asleep in the middle of that press interview? - Did anybody notice? - Oh, no. - Where's Jason? - He's gone to get some film for his camera. He promised the school newspaper an exclusive story with photographs. - This hero stuff is getting way outta line. I have to talk to him when he gets back. - Good luck. - You all right? - Yes, fine. - Listen, mister, I have-- - It's okay, dad. Just this once. - What do you mean "It's okay, dad, just this once." - Just a couple. - What, that's enough. - Stop. Talk to him. - Okay, now picture of you, Mom. One more. - No, just one. Talk to him. (mysterious music) - Won't work. - In theory, it'll work. - Fuck theory. Has anybody ever done an operation anything like this before? - Well, with that kind attitude, how can you expect results, huh? - We're fully qualified to execute this. If anybody's qualified. We're years from this kind of experimentation, decades from this kind of surgery. - Somebody's gotta do it first. Might as well be us. - Yeah, but let's do it on a chimpanzee, not on a human being. - Dr. Brock. - Gentleman! - Morning, gentleman. - Morning, Dr. Brock. - Dr. Brock, I don't think I wanna take any responsibility for this operation. - What's the matter? - Well, I don't think it's gonna work. Replacing the frontal lobe with micro circuitry is too dangerous. We can't be sure we're gonna control the subconscious. It's too powerful. - You want out? - You bet. - Show the gentleman out. Anybody else want out? Good. Follow me. (mysterious music) - Doctor, do we maintain control of a neuroanatomy? - Those portions of the brain that produce creativity and logic and ethics are still far too subtle for us to fully understand. Let alone completely control. But the simple motor responses that govern physical movement, speech and sense perception. Those are within our technical grasp. - What about residual memory, Doctor? - Wiped clean. Remember, this patient is brain dead. - You're talking total erasure here? - Yeah. - I hope they booted up the newer observational systems. - We can't afford to worry about the unconscious. - I'm just talking motor functions. How big's the unit? - Five centimeters by 11 centimeters. That'll be 55 cubic centimeters. We have to remove that much white matter? - Correct. - And if this works, let's try it on your nurse. - I think you'd have to ask her permission first, Doctor. - Who's the volunteer? - I hope he doesn't have any skin diseases. Back at the clinic they scrape 'em off the freeway and expect me to work miracles. - I think I braided the fourth green one yesterday. - Guess we're clean. - Gentlemen. (mysterious music) Let me introduce you to the patient. - [Doctor] Jesus. - Move her slowly now. - Watch the line. Gentlemen, let's move her in unison now. (keyboard clicking) (computer beeping) - A nice synchronous rhythm here, Doctor - Laser on standby. - 100 watts. Point one second pulse mode, standby. - Drill ready? - Ready. - Another drill, please. - Showing a marked decrease in the alpha rhythms in the right side. - It's third grade. And there's the violin lessons. Can make her the perfect woman. Make sure she never speaks again if you remove her broca's area. - Very funny, Doctor. - [Doctor] Blood pressure's rising. Blood pressure still rising. - How high is it? - [Doctor] 200 over 120, you gotta get it down. - Shit. Cut the anterior cerebral artery. Give me a medium clamp. A clamp. We're gonna need (indistinct) and thank you. We'll get it in there doctor. We're gotta stop this first. - [Doctor] Don't put too much traction on that optic nerve. - Shouldn't matter since we're replacing that eye with the video lens. We have to connect this through other precentral gyrus. Otherwise we'll only have control of half her body. - I know which half I want. - I think we're leaving her too much residual memory by saving the temporal load. - How many times have I told you, she's brain dead. She won't remember us or the operation. (suspenseful music) - Wake her up. Welcome back, Samira. - It's been a long time, Harry. - What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be in the hospital. - It's good to see you. - What happened to the hand? - A little accident. - No, I heard you were hurt real bad. They said you were supposed to be in the hospital a few more weeks. - But they were wrong. I'm ready to go back to work. I just need to talk to my prisoner. - Look Eric, there have been some changes. How about a drink? Huh? - No thanks. Just tell me where I can find Samira. - Well, I - I can't tell you that, it's classified. - What do you mean classified? This is my operation. She's my only lead. I need her to get to Hassim. - Look Eric, you've been taken off this one. The agency has sent in a new operative. - What are you talking about? - The agency's trying a new field operation. A new system. They're gonna get Hassim. - Harry, we know each other a long time. We've been through a lot together. Believe me, this one is mine. - It's not up to me. There have been some changes in the department. Now, I don't like it anymore than you do, but there's nothing I can do about it. - Yeah, maybe there's something I can do about it. - Eric. Leave it alone. It's out of my hands. It's not your war anymore. - See you, Harry. Yeah, Derek, I need your help, man. I'm knee-deep in bullshit and I'm sinking fast. They took me off. Yeah. So you gotta help me find Samira, my only link to Hassim. I want you to come over to my place right away. Yeah. Thanks. - Make it move. Very good. Very good. Back, back. Ready? One more. One more. Excellent, excellent, excellent. Okay, okay. This way, this way. Very good! Hey! What's happening? - Hi. How you doing? When you say, Jay? Hi, Sharon. - Hi. - Can I get you a beer or anything? Nah. - You want some lunch? - Sure, love some. - How do you like yours? - Any way you make them. - Hey, can I talk to you a minute? - What? Yeah, sure. - I'm cooking. I'm cooking. - Yeah, but they're burning. - They're not burning. - Come on. - Go away. (Sharon giggles) SQ? - Yeah, I found out about Samira. - What happened? - She didn't make it. - What happened to the body? Where's the body? - That's a strange question. - Really? A top terrorist is captured, brought back to the United States and suddenly everybody's dead quiet about it. I think that's strange. - [Sharon] Lunch is ready. - I'll be right there, honey. - Hey, it's not your problem anymore. Forget about it. You got a beautiful house, a great family. Enjoy it, you've earned it. - So you can blow it up one or two fields. - Anymore than that, it starts to get grainy. - Lots of your pictures are grainy. - Yeah, well I plan 'em like that. - Why don't you just take tighter shots? - Because sometimes I like the way they look when they're grainy. - Well, it sounds like to me you're just trying to cover up for your mistakes. - Oh really? Let's take a look at some of your master work, all right? Okay- - Let me see. - What do you think? (ominous music) Dad? Dad? - Go to the kitchen and gimme a Coca-Cola. - Samira. (knocking on door) - Ned, Ned. - Hey Eric, what the hell's going on? What's so important? - Thanks for coming by. I need to show you something. Take a look at this. You know this man? - Where'd you get that? - I thought I asked you a question. - It's Alex Brock. - Oh, come on. Who is he? - He's G-6. He's a special scientific consultant to the Pentagon. Runs a place called Cybertron. - [Eric] Do you have any idea who this woman is? - No. Should I? - It's Samira. The terrorist I brought back from Beirut. - [Ned] So what? - [Eric] So tell me what Brock's doing with her. - I don't know. I don't wanna know. Neither should you. Eric, I said it's G-6. Whatever they do is none of my business. - So I'm gonna make it my business. (somber music) - I can't live like this anymore. - You knew what you were getting into when we got married. - I thought there'd be an end to it one day. - It's my work. It's all I know how to do. - What you do, what you know. What about me? Don't they have the right to a husband and Jason doesn't have the right to a father? We never know whether you're gonna come waltzing through the door or they're gonna bring you home in a box. You know what happened the last time you went away? I can't go through it again, Eric. I can't. I can't. (gun firing) (tense music) - To a certain extent, she's self programmed. She can monitor 20 different conversations at the same time. In person, through radio waves in the middle of a knife fight. - Any problems with her personality? - She hasn't got one. - Congratulations, Dr. Robert. - Thank you. - Victor. She's stunning, a job well done. - I'll take that as a vote of confidence. - Absolutely. Absolutely. (tense music) - [Radio] Kilo six, IRM. Kilo six, IRM. - Yeah, hello? - [Eric] Mike, this is Eric Matthews. - Eric, is that you? How the hell have you been, man? God, I been reading a lot about you lately. Seems like you really left them begging in Beirut, huh? - Yeah, well that was yesterday. Today it looks like the agency can do just fine without me. I've been taken off that case. - Well, those kind of things have happened before, huh? - Believe me, this time is different. - What do you mean? - This is gonna be my last assignment. I'm getting out, but not before I get this terrorist Samira. I'm gonna break into Cybertron. - Cybertron? Are you kidding man? That's G-6 - The security there is tighter than the White House. - You got it. Now, I might need some help. Can you come by my place tomorrow in the afternoon? - Sure, pal. Anything for you. I'm looking forward to seeing you. - Thanks. - I'm sorry. (car engine roaring) (suspenseful music) - Dr. Brock. There's someone on the roof. - Guard. (alarm siren blaring) (suspenseful music) (slow suspenseful music) - Where are 12 year olds around when you need one? (guards chatting) (suspenseful music) Oh, great. - [Guard] There's somebody, let's go. Stop! You there! He went to the left, let's go! - [Eric] Shit. (guard yelling) - [Guard] He's getting away! Come on, let's go! Stop or I'll shoot! Stop right there. (gun fires) (suspenseful music) - [Guard] Hey! (suspenseful music) (guns firing) - Come on. (suspenseful music) (machine gun firing) (tires screeching) (machine gun firing) - [Road Worker] Hey, stop! (tires screeching) (suspenseful music) (tires screeching) (suspenseful music) (car explodes) (tires screeching) (doorbell rings) - You sure know how to make a guy feel welcome. - Come on in. Come on. - Well, how are things going with Sharon? - She went away for a while. - I can't say I blame her. I mean, this whole thing's given me the creeps. You know what I mean? - Yeah. - Hey, did you get anything at Cybertron? - Matter of fact, I did. Grabbed that on my way out. - Oh, God. You know, there's a reason you call this software. You gotta take it easy with these things. Oh, incidentally, have you seen this? Looks like Hassim wants Samira back. - She's becoming a real popular lady. Run that disc right away for me. Come on, move it. - Okay, I'm gone. - Wait til you get a load of this. Where did you dig this up? We used to use this for surveillance a few years ago. It's been in storage. I got a hell of a buy on it. - I bet you did. Hey, about the disc. Find anything? - You'll love this. The agency, they brainwashed Samira, sent her back to Beirut to kill her own people. - What? - Yeah. - Samira? - Yeah, your friends at Cybertron did some reconstructive work on her as well. Brain muscles, all her internal organs, if any, have either been replaced or modified. - So you're telling me that Samira is now a robot? - Not quite, she's a living machine. A perfect killing machine. - Nice place, Beirut. Looks like the tourist season's a bit down this year. Yeah, I hear they're putting in a new amusement park called Gaddaffi Land. Where an e-ticket means you get to kill innocent people. - They don't have e-tickets anymore. Just all day passes. - It was a joke. It's just a joke. - Well, I don't like being here. - Relax, the pay is great. It's gonna be so much fun watching her rip terrorists in half. Hey, the new action Barbie. We're in at the ground floor. - What if something goes wrong? - What if Yogi Bear kills the president? You can't worry about things like that. - Maybe you're right. - Shit, this little girl is gonna be so much fun to watch. And we get to rub her up. - So this is it? - YEP- It's time to let this baby go to work. Okay, Barbie, go find Ken. - Got any quarters? (ominous music) - Well, can't expect everything on the first date. So I did take her out last night in a van and I pushed some buttons. - Mark, that's 4.7 on the red. We're 14 minutes from drop point, sir. - How many operatives do you know who would walk unchecked into Hassim headquarters and kiss him on the cheek? - Not another living human being, sir. (tense music) - This is great. Wherever she goes, we go. - I wish we had some popcorn. (guard speaking in foreign language) (guard choking) - Wow, scratch one terrorist. - It looks good, sir. - [Guard] Samira, Samira? - [Assistant] We're five by five on telemetry now. - A total success. - Congratulations, sir. - Thank you. - Oh, man. I love these terrorists. And their camouflage suits with the trees and leaves on them. If they'd wear clothes with blown up cars on 'em, they'd blend in better. - Keep going. Keep going. (tense music) Bingo, there's Hassim. - All right. (tense music) Fucking A! - What? (men shouting in foreign language) (guns firing) - Barbie Rambo killing machine. - Total success. (guns firing) Okay boys, bring her in. - Activating homey. - Okay, come on home, darling. (ominous music) - Welcome back, Samira. - Job well done. (gun firing) - Congratulations Dr. Brock. - [Assistant] Sir, there's something wrong. - [Dr. Brock] Yeah, I can see that. - I'm not communicating. - I've got a problem. Dr. Brock. Sir, I'm giving her command and there's no response. (guns firing) - Congratulations, Doctor Brock, a job well done. - Welcome back, Samira. Samira. (tense music) - [Chris] What's she doing? - I have no idea. - [Chris] You made her. - [Dr. Brock] Tell her to self-destruct. - [Chris] She's flipping out. - [Dr. Brock] I said self destruct! - Right. It's not stopping. - [Assistant] The self-destruct is not kicking in. - Close the door, man. We're getting the hell outta here now. (Chris screaming) (gun firing) - [Assistant] What shall I do, sir? - Triple command, search backwards, purge memory. We must shut her down. - The healing mechanism is working, sir. Her arm will be repaired in 20 seconds. - You're next, Brock. - [Assistant] We've lost her, sir. (airplane engine roaring) - Hi, I'm Richard Nuchapon. Do you like flying? I mean, you know, not flying like a bird soaring through the sky or an airplane 'cause that's natural flying. But, and come to think of it, if you were to try that, you couldn't do it. And if you were up in the sky, you'd come crashing down and go splat! (man laughing) Right. Sign language-- (man yells) - If I want you to say anything, I'll let you know. - Chemical warfare, Agent Orange. Now this, it's all experimental technology. - You have got an operative outta control. She killed one of my men. - It just seems that something may have gone haywire. - Yeah, something sure did go haywire, Harry. Why? - She was programmed for one purpose, for one job. But for Christ sake, the program's malfunctioned. It's a computer. Something went wrong. I'm sure it'll be stopped before anything can happen. They have ways of deactivating it. - Try telling that to Chris. - Connect me to Victor Blake. - Brock's people lost control of Samira and it seems that they can't locate her. (computer beeps) - Wait a second, hold on. I'm getting an important call. Look Turner, I'll get back to you, okay? Yes, Blake here. - This is Harry Carlson. Your project's finished. Your assassin killed one of our own people. - What are you talking about? - [Harry] I'm closing you down. - Wait a second. Wait a second. Wait a second. That project was successful. Hassim Abair is eliminated. Do you know that? - If I knew something like this was going to happen, I should have stopped you before this. - [Blake] What do you mean stop me? - I'm gonna blow your operation wide open. - [Harry] I'll make sure it'll be as though it never existed in the first place. And if I have to, I'll let Congress string you out to dry. You're finished! - You go ahead, you try that. But don't you ever dare threaten me, you understand that? - It's no threat. (phone dialing) (gentle music) (telephone ringing) - [Brock] Hello. - Brock, this is Victor. - What the hell is going on? - [Brock] Victor? Hello. It's a shame you couldn't make it tonight. Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves immensely. - Brock, cut the shit. Your goddamn robot's killed some of my men. - [Brock] I'm afraid we've lost complete control of her. - [Victor] No Alex, you lost control of her. (people chatting) I am not taking the fucking ax for this, Brock. - Believe me, I did everything that I could. I'm afraid there's nothing I can do until she surfaces. - [Victor] No, Brock. That's not good enough. We'll find her. (Brock choking) Brock? Brock? Brock, what's-- (Brock choking) - [Receptionist] Beckman Import Export. - Suite 402. 1-3-2-7-4-3-8-3 G-6, Alpha Five. - [Benedict] Alpha Five. - Benedict, is this line clean? - Of course. - Well, things have gotten outta hand here. I have some work for you. A little house cleaning. - Who? - Carlson and one other, Matthews. Eric Matthews. (ominous music) Terminate with extreme prejudice. - Understood. - Hi, love. I tell you, the things we do to keep ourselves looking good. Hairstyles, designer clothes, makeup, huh? Perfume. And for what? So we can vamp some total geek into buying us a crab salad. Please, what do they think we are anyway? Dolls? Robots? Oh. It's a wig. I get some pretty strange reactions sometimes. But what the hell? - Beats selling yourself downtown. - [Man] Okay then, show us how it's done. (people chatting) - You or me? Let me handle this? (phone beeping) (Samira beeps) - What is it? - [Tech Guy] We have a break into the computer, sir. - What level has been breached? - [Tech Guy] Priority level four. They're into the personnel records, names, addresses. I can put the information they're getting up on your monitor. - Please. Matthews? And Hazard. - Hey, baby. Don't be so anti-social. Just join us for a game of pool. Maybe you like to play some other games. Can I buy you a drink? - Go away. (computer beeping) (country music) - [Harry] Eric, this is Harry Carlson. Samira has surfaced and killed Dr. Brock. I'm afraid you are the next likely target. She's broken into our computer and pulled up a number of addresses, including yours and Mike Hazards. It looks like she's going after anyone involved with the project. I suggest you go under, deep under. And Eric, take your family with you. - [Sharon] Hi, I'm at my mothers and we'll just wait until this is all over and you can call us here. - [Jason] Hi, dad. I love you. (suspenseful music) (silenced gun fires) (silenced gun fires) (suspenseful music) - [Operator] 9-1-1 emergency. - I wanna report a murder. - [Operator] What is your location? - 2,907 Glen Oaks. - [Operator] Are you a family member, sir? - No, I'm a friend. (furniture crashing) (suspenseful music) (glass shattering) (railing crashes) (water splashing) - Carlson said you were the best. Looks to me like you've lost it. - Where is he? What's happened to him? - He's dead. So are you. (man yells) - Who sent you? Who are you working for? Who? - Forget it. (suspenseful music) - Freeze! - What the hell is (suspenseful music) (motorcycle engine revving) - Wanna eat at El Carters when we're finished with this guy? - Yeah, sure. That sounds good to me. (cop yells) (suspenseful music) - Help! Help! Get me out. Get me out of here. It's gonna blow. Come on, let me go. Get him out. (suspenseful music) (motorcycle engine roaring) - Government code 6-0-1-6, emergency one. (phone beeps) Yep? - Donovan, what the hell's going on? I can't get through to Carlson. I can't get through to anybody. - Carlson's dead. Everybody's dead. The whole security community shot to shit. Brock's damn cyborg has gone berserk. Eric, she knows you're still alive and she knows how to get to you. - [Eric] What are you talking about? - Sharon and Jason, they've just got back. We're holding them at the Federal Reserve Base at Camarillo. - [Eric] And what's your plan? - Don't worry about me, Ace. I'm a natural born survivor. Oh, hold on. There's another call coming in. Yes? (Samira screaming) (car crashes) - Donovan! Donovan, can you hear me? Donovan, come in! (motorcycle engine roaring) (suspenseful music) - Dad, I'm not feeling too well. May I be excused? - No, you don't. - Why? Why don't you just go on upstairs? (downbeat music) - Why do we have to wait here? - Not gonna do us any good in running. She'll just come after us. Why does she wanna kill us, dad? - She wants to get everybody who's responsible for the capture. Turning her against her own people. - [Jason] You gonna kill her? (suspenseful music) How are we supposed to stop a robot with a ship? (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) - Who the hell they think they're scaring? (soldiers yelling) - [Military Leader] Beta seven, yellow sector. We're clearing the south perimeter. (gun firing) (barrels exploding) (guns firing) (vehicle explodes) - We've got her. Come on. (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (gun firing) (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (gun firing) (gun firing) (gun firing) (suspenseful music) - Soft target, men. Come on, let's go! (suspenseful music) (truck explodes) (suspenseful music) (bulldozer engine roaring) (rocket launcher blasts) (suspenseful music) (Samira screams) (dramatic music) (somber music) (gentle music) (oriental music)
