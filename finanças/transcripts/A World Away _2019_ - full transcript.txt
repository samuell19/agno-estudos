(dramatic music) (flames roaring) (dramatic vocalizing) (spaceship whooshing) (dramatic music) - [Kem] The Zeta ship is closing, Captain. - Stop swerving! - I have a lock them, fire! - Fire! - [Evil Queen] Don't fire! - [Pilot] Fire! - Fire! - Stop firing, you morons! We'll destroy it! - Destroy it! - I need the source intact! - We, ah, need the source! - The source must be protected at all costs. - [Evil Queen] The source is my only hope! - What hope? - Only hope! - Could you give it a rest? - Like a nap? Ah! - The source is everything and everywhere, as it is here now with us. (tense music) - They're reducing their speed! (spaceship whooshing) - Eject it, where it shall remain hidden. (laser beams firing) - Towards the wormhole! They're ejecting the source! - Ejecting the source? Why would they do that? - To hide it. We know where it goes but not when. - He's right, they're playing with us! Follow the ship! - The source supplies almost all the energy powering this ship, Captain. If we eject it, we will not survive. - I'm well aware of the consequences of ejecting it, Lyra. - Yes, sir. - Prepare entry into Earth's atmosphere. - The source will be mine, and the universe will be mine! - Captain, our mission specifically restricts us from entering the Earthling experience. - Our mission comes secondary to our responsibilities to the greater good. - Fire the ship! - Let's fire! - No, do not fire! Follow the ship! Follow it! - Ah! - [Pilot] Fire! - Fire! - Don't fire! Don't fire! - Ah! - We will not, we must not let it pass into the hands of such wretched creatures, even if it means sacrificing ourselves to do so. - Yes, Father. - Follow the ship! - Ah! - Those who are evil will seek to tarnish its purity. - We will take it and we will destroy the ship, and the universe will be mine! - Destroy its veritas as they would destroy us and everything that we stand for, including them. - [Kem] The shield is at 5%. - She will hold. (console whirring) - Wait, there are Earthlings present. - Eject the source. - Captain, they will find it. - Yes, my daughter, they will find it. They will seek to use it for their own benefit, but nonetheless, the source shall guide them. And we, we will trust that it will return to us at a time known only to itself. (uplifting music) And our sacrifice shall not be in vain. What's beneath us now? - Geo-scan confirms we are headed for a large desert, mostly of sandstone. No sign of intelligent life forms. Semi-arid landmass. - [Kem] Nothing is responding, Captain. We're in a free fall. (console beeping) (spaceship exploding) (dramatic music) (crystal humming) (birds screeching) (horses chuffing) (elephant trumpeting) (flames roaring) (dramatic vocalizing) (people chattering) (crystal ringing) (baby crying) (dramatic music) (guns firing) - [Mom] Where is it? - Where's what? - Danny? - What are you talking about? - Do you think I'm crazy? Do you ever want to play your video game again? Where did he hide it? Behind your back, hand it over, Danny. Hand it over. Okay guys, I've gotta leave. Bedtime is at 9:00 p.m. sharp, do not give Grandma any fuss. Are we clear? - This is your third dinner meeting this week. You sure it's not a date? - It's business, and no more video games. Annie, honey, you feeling any better yet? - I don't. - Hey kiddo, kids can be mean, but if you let them see how much it affects you, that's their ticket to keep doing it, okay? I love you guys. - Good luck. - You know you're not supposed to be-- - Shut up. (gentle music) - [Grandma] Hello, my angels. - Hey, Grandma. - You didn't even look up at me. (electronics beeping) (guns firing) I might be a wolf dressed up as your grandma, and you wouldn't know it. What's wrong, princess? - She's upset because she doesn't have any friends. - That's not true, those aren't my friends! - Fine, the kids who aren't her friends are being mean to her, so she cried a lot. - I might have a remedy for that. And you are disrespecting three women. Your mom, who told you to put it way, your grandma, who just took it away, and above all, your little sister, who you should be protecting. Now, I think I have the perfect story. Who wants to hear it? - Me, Grandma, sit next to me. (Grandma chuckling) (Grandma sighs) (gentle music) - How about whoever listens to the story gets dessert? I might have some Mars Bars in the freezer. (Grandma chuckles) So, there was a girl who lived alone, not all alone, but it definitely felt that way. It was just her and her dad, and he was usually very busy. Always working, just like your mom. She was an only child, no brothers and no sisters. She lost her mom when she was young, and her dad, who was really protective, kept her at home where her only friends were the horses that lived on the ranch with them and a goofy kid down the road, three years younger than me. - Huh? - Wait. What's a ranch? - Oh, it was a house but where animals also lived. So, this girl who loved to read, which both of you need to do more often. - [Kids] We know, Grandma. - Even though she felt lonely, she always knew that somewhere out there, life held great adventures and more often than not, what we imagine for ourselves becomes real. (uplifting music) (eagle screeching) (hooves pounding) (horses neighing) (hooves clopping) - That was delicious, thank you, mm. - Am I ever gonna really graduate? - Sure, from your college graduation. I'll see you later, hon. - [Carmen] Mom would let me. - You know, rumor has it, there is a new panther exhibit at the zoo, and if someone gives Daddy a little smile, I'll protect her from the panther. Here comes the panther. - No, Daddy, don't do it! (Thomas growling) You can't escape the mighty unicorn. - The what? The unicorn? I don't see any unicorn. (Carmen neighing) Oh, there's a unicorn in here! - [Carmen] I'm gonna get you! - How did that happen? (Thomas laughing) Ah, okay, I'll see you in a little bit. - Bye, I love you. - [Thomas] I love you too, honey. (sullen music) - Welcome, friends and family and parents, and especially to the graduates of 2015. (audience applauding) And now, I'd love to announce the winners of this year's overnight excursion to the Grand Canyon. Here to help me do that is Mr. Thomas Landry. (audience applauding) (Thomas and Principal Garcia laughing) - [Audience Member] Sounds good to me. - Thank you, I'm so happy to be here and a part of this wonderful event, past three years have been great. - They've been wonderful for us too, thank you. - Yes, yeah. - And of course, Thomas is too modest to let you know, but once again, he has donated the use of his personal private plane. (audience clapping) Wonderful. And also, for all of the kids to stay in your very exclusive cabin just north of the Canyon. (audience clapping) - Woo! - [Audience Member] Woo! - It's not that exclusive. (Principal Garcia laughing) - [Principal Garcia] And now, would you please do the honors? - Yes, of course, the first name. - All right, here we go. Zoey Cristopolos, come on up here, Zoey. (audience clapping) - See, I told you you would win, it's high probability. - There she is, give her a bog hand everyone, come on. Let's give it up for Zoey. Give it up, everyone. Congratulations, Zoey. - [Zoey] Thank you. - All right, next we have Jessica Patterson. - [Students] Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! - All right, that's enough. (upbeat music) I don't know how her name got in here either. - Congrats. - Go get a new outfit, Zoey. - I actually like just bought this recently. - Jessica, maybe you need to go shopping, maybe you could find the other half of your pants. (audience chuckling) All right, next we have our valedictorian, Henry Jefferson. Congratulations, Henry. Wonderful. - I told you, it's rigged. - Fantastic. - Yeah. - Jessica. - And next we have Theodore Williams. (audience clapping) Theodore, there he is. - Can you walk a little faster, Teddy? - Yeah, Tubby Teddy. - All right, zip it. Okay, congratulations, Theodore. And last but not least, Mateo Experanzo. (audience cheering) - That's my brother! - Congratulations to the winners and happy graduation everyone! (audience applauding) (mellow music) - Huh? See, now you can graduate like everyone else today too. - (sighs) I wanna really graduate. - Carmen, we've been through this. I'm not sending you to public school, and they're aren't any good private schools in this area anymore. Plus, you're doing great at your independent studies. You're way ahead of the other kids. Boarding school is just out of the question. - But it's not fair, I wanna be like the other kids. I'm sick of this house, I wanna have real friends. - You have real friends. What about that kid Ralphy down the street? Right? (Carmen sighs) And there's plenty of stuff to do around here. I bought you an Arabia filly last Christmas, and you barely even ride her. - That's 'cause you won't let me take her out of the arena. - Carmen, we're not putting this up for debate, okay? You're not going to public school. Hey honey, one day, you'll thank me for this. - No, I'll hate you for it. You always tell everyone to be unselfish, but you're the one who's selfish. You're just afraid you're gonna lose me like we most Mommy to cancer. - Hey, that's not fair, young lady. Do no bring your mother into this. One more outburst like that, and no electronics for a week. Now, go to your room. - Fine. - And don't slam the door. (door slams) (Thomas sighs) (bell clanking) Hey Ralphy. - Hi, Mr. Landry, is Carmen here right now? - Not now, now's not a good time. - Are you sure? She told me to come over. - [Thomas] Oh, she did, huh? Look, why don't you tell your parents that you said hi, and we'll do it another time. - Well, we can do homework. (Thomas laughing) - All right, why don't you come back tomorrow night for dinner, okay? - Fair deal. Bye, Mr. Landry. - Bye, buddy. - Wait a minute, if the girl had no other friends, why'd the dad just send that boy away. - Yeah, and why doesn't he let her go to school? - I don't know, it was difficult for him to pick a school, and remember that in every story, characters have lessons to learn, even the adults. - Especially the adults. I'm sorry, Gram, but I think that dad is really mean. - You might think that now, but a lot more will happen, and that might change. - Maybe. - I have one more question. - Mm-hmm. - Do we go on the trip with those kids, or do we stay on the ranch with the sad girl. (Grandma laughing) - So many questions. Shall we let the story unfold? Can I continue? Good. So, that night at supper, Carmen was still really sad, and she said to her father, "You promised me "that if I finished my homework, "you would let me play with it when you get to the house." (sullen music) - [Carmen] Hi. (Thomas sighs) - I know it's been hard since Mom died. And I know I've been too protective. It's just, I'll try to ease up, I promise. - I just, I wanna be like the other kids. I wanna have friends, I wanna have fun. - I know, honey, I know. Listen, I have an extra seat on the plane for the trip with the eighth graders to the Grand Canyon. Do you wanna go? - Wait, really, the eight graders, seriously? Oh my gosh, that would be so fun. (Thomas laughing) - Well, actually, they're high schoolers now. - Yes, thank you, thank you, I love you. (horse neighing) (adventurous music) - [Teddy] Sorry. - Hey. - Hey. Yeah. How you doing? - Hi guys, I'm Carmen, my dad's Mr. Landry. - Oh, hi. - Oh yeah, hi. - [Teddy] Hi, hi, Carmen. - Hi. - I'm Teddy. - Hey guys, look, it's the beauty and the brawn. - Who lives here, the Lone Ranger? - Give it a chance, Jess. - So nice of you to grace us with your presence. - I'll be gone for one day, Mom. - Hey guys, who's ready for an amazing adventure to the Grand Canyon, huh? Who's ready for an amazing adventure to the Grand Canyon? - Woo! - Yeah. - All right. Now, I know you guys have been waiting for this day for the past few weeks, and here it is. I want you to take a look across the road. You guys know that that is? Lady Luck, she's been with me for 10 years. Never had a problem, always had her maintenance, so don't worry, you're in good hands. Now, I don't wanna brag, but I'm an ex-Navy pilot, so it's all good. All right, in about an hour and a half, we'll be landing just northing of the Canyon. We'll meet our tour guide, and she'll take us down into the Canyon and show us around. I hope you're ready for some amazing views, some wildlife, great pictures, and a great time. - Woohoo! - Yeah. - Yeah, I like your spirit, honey. - Thanks. - Okay, so I want you to text your parents that we're gonna be back here tomorrow at 4:00 p.m. Tell 'em, "Be here or be square." (laughing) - (laughs) What? - Okay, so on that note, let's load up. Here we go, come on, Carmen. And at some point, I'm gonna get a smile outta you. (adventurous music) Okay, we're all set. Now, wait a second, missy, you're ridin' up front with me. Come on. Let's try to be on our best behavior, and remember, most importantly, the rules of the aircraft. - What rules? - Look right over there. - One, two, three, Ranger Rick here, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, dogs, riffraff, who's ever out there. Listen up, we got some news for you. You're headin' out there to Grand Canyon, and it's gonna be a bumpy ride, but you're gonna listen to one man and one man only, Captain Thomas Landry. - That's me. - You know it is. If Captain Thomas Landry tells you, "Spin around "and do a little disco," then you do the disco. You're gonna listen to the rules. It's gonna be fun, you're gonna enjoy it. Ranger Rick, out. - Hi-tech, huh? Okay, come on, honey. - Don't worry, Jess, it'll be fun. (plane engine whirring) - [Thomas] Okay, young children, you can take your seat belts off. - Guys, look, over there, that's an alluvial fan. It has water coming down the hillside, and in the convergences where-- - Give it rest, nerd, we're on vacation. - Hey, that wasn't very nice. - Who even are you? - I'll have you know that my dad's the one taking you on this vacation. - Figures, spoiled little brat. - Oh, come on, Jess, she's like eight years old. - I'm 11 1/4. - See, 10 years old, might as well leave her alone. - I'm actually very mature for my age. - Bet you are. (gentle music) - What's happening? - Oh, the plane's going through differences in the density layer, it's-- - We're just going through some bumpy air. It's called turbulence. - It's totally normal in this area. The captain has turned on the fasten seat belt sign. Be over soon. - It better be over soon. I don't feel so well. - It should be over soon, what's that supposed to mean? - It's all good, it'll pass. - Sometimes, when I'm not feeling too well on an airplane, I wear these and imagine I'm on the top of rollercoasters. - Not all over us are five, Zoey. - Try to be nice. (Teddy retches) - What was that? Are you kidding me, Teddy bear? You couldn't have kept those graham crackers in your stomach for at least a few more minutes? These are brand new shoes. - [Teddy] I'm sorry, Jessica. - [Thomas] Is everything okay back there? - [Zoey] Yeah, we're good. - Technically, you shouldn't wear new shoes on days like this due to potential wear and tear. - Here. (tense music) - What's going on? - I don't know, it's not responding. - What's not responding? - Don't worry, she's been through worse than this. - Who's she? - She's a common usage for all mechanically-driven apparati. - [Mateo] Seriously? - Mr. Landry, I heard the engine stop, I heard it stop! - Venus control, this is Lady Luck 134. Mayday, mayday, we have lost control. We are in a free fall. - [Jessica] I told you guys this, we're all going to die. - 112.12 west, I have lost control, we're going down. - Mr. Landry, you have to do something. We're all going to die. - What? - Everybody, we're going down, put your head between your legs, hold on to something, brace yourselves. - [Zoey] Get down, get down. (tense music) (wormhole whirring) - What's happening? What's happening, what's happening? - [Zoey] Are you guys seeing this? Seeing this, seeing this? - I think we're in another dimension. Another dimension, I think we're in another dimension. (warbled speaking) - [Zoey] Are you guys seeing this? Are you guys seeing this? - Yeah. - I know I'm dreaming. Dreaming, dreaming. - Daddy, what's happening? Daddy, what's happening, what's happening? (dramatic music) - [Zoey] Guys, what's happening? - I've seen it-- - [Zoey] I see it too. - [Henry] That's, it's the desert, we can-- - [Zoey] We're getting to the ground. - You okay, is everyone okay back there? - You almost killed us! - I think so. - Hold on, we're gonna land down here. - Okay. (Jessica sighs) - Good. - Good. (suspenseful music) - I'm gonna land us right over there, hold on, guys. (plane engine whirring) (kids gasping) - Okay. - We're good. We're good. - We're okay. We're good. We're good. (Jessica gasps) - Oh my god! (Jessica sighs) Oh my god. - I'm sorry. (Jessica whimpers) - Grandma, I'm confused. Where are they? - Not here, that's for sure. - Well, it's a little more complicated. - I get it, it's just another planet, but not in our solar system. - Uh, close, but not exactly. - What was that thing they traveled through? A diamond, um, dimen-- - Oh, dimension. - Yes. - Well, you both know that travel involves two things, space and time, so space where you went. Time, time isn't quite so simple. - Yes, it is. Time is seconds, minutes, hours, days. - Yeah, but it's not just that. All right, for example, when you're playing your games your mom says, "You have 10 minutes left," but it feels like two minutes have gone, and then you're doing something else, like sitting in a classroom and the clock on the walls says 10 minutes till the end of class, but it feels like forever. - I hate that feeling. - (chuckles) I know. So, how can you be sure that they were both 10 minutes? They felt completely different, but the clock said they were the same. So, what do you think so far? - I just hope they're okay. (Grandma chuckles) - I like that the stuck-up girl got thrown up on. (Grandma laughing) And I'm gonna work on a new planet colony when I grow up. - Are you now? Ooh, sounds dangerous. But you know, you have to get good grades even to be considered. - I'm not scared, and I can pay attention when I want to. - Oh. Does that mean that when you're being bad, you can control it? (gentle music) - I get it. (Grandma chuckles) - So, shall we see where they are? - Yes, finish. - All right, where were we. Ah yes, so they were sweltering in the desert trying to figure out why there were two suns in the sky. (Grandma sighs) (Thomas sighs) - Okay guys, I'm just gonna go outside for a minute. I'll be right back. Gonna check the plane for damages. - Why does the sun look like that? - Oh, because we went through a dimensional change. - What's that supposed to mean? - It means, Henry thinks we're not home anymore. - Well, of course, we're not home. - Does anybody realize that I have barf all over me? Henry, if you're so smart, could you please tell me where the nearest shower is? - Sorry, Jessica, I-- - Shut it, fatty, you've done enough. - Well, more specifically, I think we've slipped into a time/space vortex. We could be anywhere really. - I still don't follow, that's the desert, we know that. - And I'm sure Mr. Landry will have us out of here in no time. - I wouldn't plan on it. - Okay, here's what's goin' on. The plane looks mostly good, but both engines are shot. (kids groaning) Don't worry, I got a distress call off. - Seriously? - Okay? We must've only flown off course a few miles. - I don't feel so good. I gotta call my mom. Hey, can I use your phone? Mine died. - Sure, just not for too long. I'm pretty sure I get charged extra around here. - Yeah, no kidding, we went through a time/space vortex. - Wait, mine's dead too. - Mine too. - Yeah, that's the other thing. Our electronics aren't working. The only thing that seems to be working is my trusty old Timex windup. It's a Timex, so-- - I know, I know, it takes a licking and it keeps on tickin'. (Henry chuckles) - No phones? - Wait! - No phones? - Hey, I told you I got the distress call off. They're gonna come for us. Look, when I was in Desert Storm, I was in a situation exactly like this, except behind enemy lines. - Dad. - We had to take cover in an old well to keep from being found. - Dad. - And then, well, there was this local farmer, and he came out to use the well, - Dad! - and then there was-- - We know, all you had was a camel and a Timex. - Right, honey, sorry, what I'm trying to say is, everything's gonna be okay. Believe me, it could be a lot worse. - Have you ever been through a dimensional change before? - What? - A dimensional change, you know, like the thing we just went though? - Did you hit your head? - That's what Henry says, at least. You know, like the things you see on the education channels. - You saw that episode too? - Yes! - [Teddy] No. - It was an electrical storm, and that explains why the gauges and our phones aren't working. Everybody just relax, okay? They're gonna come for us. Jessica's got it, look. Relax like that, okay? (tense music) (thunder rumbling) (Jessica sighs) - I can't take this anymore. No one's coming. - They're coming, Teddy. It's okay, just hold on, I know it's hot. - Daddy, it's really hot, and it's been a really long time. - I know, pumpkin. - Weren't you guys supposed to provide us with lunches anyways? - Yeah, I can't do anything about that now. - Well, what about water and electrolytes? - Okay, okay, all right, guys. Because it's only getting hotter and hotter in here, and as Zoey pointed out, we're already running low on water. So, we're gonna get out, take a short hike up to that ridge and try to find some water. Who knows, there could be a town on the other side of the hill or a spring along those rocks. - A hike? Oh man, I really didn't sign up for this? - Well, then you can roll back down the mountain, Teddy bear. - Don't call me that. - Come on, guys, let's keep it together, okay? Look, it's not gonna be far. So, everybody line up single file, grab only what you need, and if you have water, bring it. (suspenseful music) - [Zoey] Here. - Thanks. - I want you to stay close, okay? Keep your eyes peeled for rattlesnakes. - What? Rattlesnakes? - Don't worry, just stay close, you'll be fine. (hissing) - What was that? - Nothing, Jess. It's just a hike through the desert. Don't be such a baby. - You know what, Mateo, shut up because you know the creepy crawlies and spiders and snakes are not my thing. - Neither apparently is emesis. Emesis, guys. Barf, vomit. - Go read a book or something, Henry. - [Henry] Like what, Vanity Fair? - [Mateo] Come on. - Come on, guys, knock it off. Keep up, okay? This is serious. I can't have anything happening to any of you, all right? Okay, now have any of you been a Boy Scout or Girl Scout? I knew I saw a scout in you, Mateo. Okay, you bring up the rear. If anything happens to me, you guys listen to Mateo. (Jessica sighs) Okay? Zoey, you come up front with me and Carmen. We need a trail guide. Honey? Carmen! - Carmen! - Carmen! - Carmen! - Carmen! - Carmen! - Carmen, where are you? - [Henry] Where are you, Carmen? (animal growling) (suspenseful music) (Carmen screaming) Carmen! - Carmen. - Carmen. - Carmen! - Where did you go? - Just right over there. - Didn't you hear me? I said, "Stay right here." - But I saw-- - No, you disobeyed me. - But I, but it-- - Listen, when I say, "Stay here," you stay here. Now, everybody, stay right here. I'm gonna go scout that ridge, I'll be right back. (Carmen sighs) - I saw something. - Hey, hey, hey, I believe you, but what exactly did you see? I mean, wolves aren't really common around here. - Well, it wasn't a coyote 'cause those live in the hills around my house, we-- - Oh, it wasn't a coyote because they live in the hills by her house. Do they play with your ponies? - No, my Arabian Thoroughbreds are always kept in the stable. - What a little spoiled brat. - Hey, hey, she's just bitter 'cause her parents aren't ever around. - Thanks, Henry. (dramatic music) - [Thomas] This way, guys. Gotta keep goin'. Careful on this ridge. - [Mateo] Come on, Teddy, move. That was one long hike. (thunder rumbling) - [Henry] I'm so thirsty. - I'm thirsty too, Daddy. - I know, honey, everybody's thirsty, okay? I'm just glad we made it up here in one piece. - That's weird, there is the plane. That makes no sense. - I don't get it. We were hiking for over an hour. The heat's playing tricks on me. - So, now what? We climb this mountain to do what? There's no water. It's just desert in every single direction, and no one's coming for us, Mr. Landry. - Now, hold on. - We're screwed! - They are coming for us, guys, okay? - When are you going to get this your head, Mr. Landry? We don't know where we are, and for all I know, we could going through that wormy hole thing the geek suggested. I mean, we don't even know if we're in Arizona. (thunder rumbling) - We're in Arizona, see? Monsoons. - What's a monsoon? - No, a monsoon, it's traditionally defined as seasonal reversing winds accompanied by precipitation. It just means quick and heavy rainfall. - Exactly, see, we're in Arizona. - Wait, rainfall, as in heavy rainfall, as in barf-cleansing rainfall. - [Henry] Yeah, it should be sufficient. (Thomas sighs) - [Thomas And Henry] Rain catching. - Wait, what are you guys getting at? - Rain catching, I mean, only if we get something big enough to catch all the rain. - The tarp. All right, guys, I gotta go back to the plane. - What, no, Daddy. - Yeah, honey, we need water, it's the only way. - But it's so far. - No, it's not that far. And I'll run there and back, all right? Mateo, you're in charge. Everybody, listen to me, stay right here. Okay. - Mr. Landry. - Yeah? - Can you check under the seat that I was sitting in? I think I might have left a box of candy bars there. - Sure, Teddy. Honey. You always said you wanted to be with your friends, right? So now, I want you to stay right here with them, okay? - Okay, Daddy, good luck. - Thank you, sweetie. But I don't need luck. I didn't see any camels, did you? (Thomas laughing) I'll be right back. (thunder rumbling) (tense music) - [Jessica] Come on, Teddy bear. - [Mateo] Hand over the goods. - Come on! - Why are you holding out on us? - What goods? - You know what goods. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Really? - [Carmen] Hand 'em over! - I was gonna tell you, I promise, but I was just waiting for the right time. (dramatic music) - Carmen! Carmen! - [Carmen] Guys, guys, my dad. - [Henry] Where is he? He should've been there by now. - [Carmen] We can't leave him. - [Thomas] Where's that hilltop. - Guys, let's get outta here. - [Mateo] Way ahead of ya. Go! (kids yelling) - [Jessica] Wait up, Mateo! - [Mateo] Guys, in the cave! - Come on, hurry, we have to get in, guys. - Go, go, guys, come on! - [Carmen] Guys, come on! Come on, it's getting closer. (tense music) Guys, come on. (kids chattering) You're good, good. - Okay, okay. - [Carmen] Yeah, yeah, you got it, come on. - See, that wasn't so bad. Is everyone okay? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Okay, okay, it seems straight now. (kids chuckling) - So, what do we do now? - We wait. - [Carmen] For what? - [Mateo] The storm to pass. - What if it doesn't pass? - What's that? - What's what? - [Zoey] That. - [Carmen] It's my grandma's necklace. (crystal whirring) - [Henry] I mean, why is it doing that? - I don't know, I mean, it's never happened before. - [Zoey] It's so pretty. - Wow, can I have it? - I just told you, it's my grandma's. - So, how much do you want for it? - It's not for sale. - What kind of a stone is that? - Yeah, I've never read about a stone that does that. - I don't know, I mean, she never told me. All she ever said is that it was special and important and to protect it. - Yeah, no kidding. Can I examine it? - Sure. - Hey guys, look, a light! It's the same color as your stone, and there's a tunnel. (inspiring music) - It looks like metal or something. - As long as it's not muddy guck. - [Zoey] Quite remarkable. - [Henry] What do you think it is? - I don't know. - Well, how do we know what's in there? What are you doing? - Don't worry about it, Jess. - Shut up, Zoey. - I'm not sure, but does anybody else think that it's weird that it's the same color as her stone? Like, they're connected or something. (inspiring music) Wow. - This is amazing. (Carmen sighs) - Ow. Sorry. - [Mateo] Come on. - [Teddy] Maybe we should go back. - Might as well have an adventure, right? - But my dad said-- - Your dad isn't here, and he isn't gonna be with all that rain falling outside. - I'm afraid she's right. We're stuck here until it lets up. - Don't you wanna know why your stone is lighting up? I think the highest probability of an answer has to be with that matching light down this tunnel. Whatever it is-- - Henry, this tunnel is never-ending. When are we going to get to whatever that thing is? - What if it's a monster or something? - Monsters aren't real. - [Mateo] We'll be there soon. Look, there's another passage way. (Jessica sighs) (tense music) - Come on. (water babbling) (Carmen sighs) - Let's go. - Wow, I've never seen a rock. - Wow. - Look. - Whoa. - Let's look. Look at that. Look at these. - [Henry] Very interesting. - Hurry up, Ted. Move. Henry, what is that? (light whirring) - Look at it. - Quite remarkable. - Wow. - Wow. - Look at it. - [Mateo] What is it? - Okay, now this is getting weird. - It wants us to go there. (rocks rumbling) - [Mateo] We gotta go! - [Teddy] Hit the deck! - This is no aftershock. - [Teddy] Cover yourself! That's really not good. - My gosh, we're stuck, now what? We're stuck! I told you guys that we were going to die in here. (water splashes) What was that? - [Mateo] What was what? - That thing, that thing in the water. Didn't you see it? - No, I didn't see anything. - I swear, I'm going crazy today. - Hey, maybe we can just find a way to the top there and get out that way. - Doubtful. - [Teddy] Yeah, that's impossible. - Yeah, I agree, I personally think wherever the light is, that's where we should be headed. - Yes, but how do we get over there? (Carmen screams) - Carmen! - Carmen! - [Teddy] Carmen! - [Zoey] Carmen! (inspiring music) - [Arture] The source must be protected at all costs. - Come on! - Come on, Carmen! - Come, wake up. - Breathe, breathe! Carmen, breathe, I'm sorry I didn't do anything. I was scared, I'm sorry! (Carmen coughing) (dramatic vocalizing) - Wow. (dramatic music) - Wow. - Are you okay, Carmen? - I think so. What happened? - Carmen, was that you in that video? - Yeah, that's when my grandma gave me the stone. - I knew it, I knew they existed! - [Zoey] What existed? - Other worlds, her stone is from another world. - So, where are we now? - We're a world away. - Who saved me? - The light saved you. It's a long story, but it looks like somebody is on your side. - We'll tell you later. I think we should get out of here, guys. This place creeps me out. - No, we have to follow the light. It's the reason we're here. - [Henry] The light! - Guys, look at the passageway. - Shouldn't we find a way out before going deeper into the cave? - No, it's guiding us. And plus, whatever that is, is our way out of here. We need to follow it. - What if it's a monster trying to eat us, like in the lake? - You saw it, what else are we gonna do? - I don't wanna go. Coming down here's only gotten us into trouble. - Yeah, and if it wasn't for you two, we wouldn't be down here in the first place. - Us two? - Yeah, you two, oh, let's go on an adventure, it'll be fun. - He's right, you're the one that led us down here. - You didn't have to follow us. - Oh, so just because you two are selfish means we all have to suffer? - Selfish, who are you calling selfish? - You, miss prissy. I do what I want, say what I want, but I really don't have a soul because no one loves me, not even my parents. - Well, technically, a lot of factors have converged on this-- - [All] Shut up, Henry! - Hey guys, come quick, look. - I don't know, guys, last time going down a tunnel didn't work out too well for us. - It's our destiny, trust me, I know. - How would you know that? - She's wearing the alien device. - Why don't we just find a way out of here like Teddy said? - There is no other way. We have to follow the light. Searching for another way will only lead to hurt and sadness. Follow me. - [Jessica] Since when did you become a philosopher? (tense music) - I have got to get a class of water. - Wait! - No, Grandma, stay! - [Grandma] I'll be right back, honey. - Can't believe she stopped now. - What's even happening to them? - I think the aliens are just using Carmen to get their rock back. - You mean, the source in her necklace? - Yeah, that's why Carmen's leading the group, but the bad aliens also want it. What was the thing in the water again? - That was so scary. Danny, do you think aliens are real? - Yeah, and I think they're in your closet. - Stop! - [Grandma] Are you teasing your sister? - No, I was just saying, if aliens are real, then I'd protect from them. - Ah, I should hope so. But, move over, you might not even be able to see them, and they might be friendly. - But they're still strangers. - Yeah, and why wouldn't you be able to see them? - Well, if they come from another planet, another galaxy, they could be physically composed of a different matter than we are, something that we can't see. (Grandma chuckles) They might be here right now. So, shall we see if the kids escape? - Yes, finish! - Yeah, what happened to the dad? Is he okay? - You wait and see, I'm gonna tell you right now. All right, this is where we were. So, he was sitting in the airplane. - What have I done? What have I done? (tense music) God, I know I haven't talked to you in a while. (thunder rumbling) I'm sorry. Please, please, don't bring Carmen into this. If something happened to her. (Thomas sighs) (dramatic music) (Thomas sobbing) ♪ It's black and it's white ♪ ♪ We fight, we make up ♪ ♪ We kiss, we break up ♪ This way. (tense music) - Outstanding. - [Mateo] This is amazing. - Go ahead. - [Henry] Let's rest in here.' - Guys, it's looks like Carmen's necklace. (sighs) It's cold. - [Mateo] It's looks manmade. - [Henry] No, it's alien-made. - [Jessica] Well, whatever it is, it looks dangerous. - There's a reason we're here. - [Ature] Trust the source, it will guide you. Trust the source. - Oh my gosh! - I don't know what's happening. - Why are we here? - What's going on? - Let her go! - [Jessica] You took us here, what's happening? - What's going on, oh my, my whole body's dissolving. - [Zoey] What's happening? - [Jessica] What is going on right now? - [Zoey] I don't know. - What's going on, I don't understand. - [Zoey] I don't get what's happening. - [Arture] Facing the darkness opens you to the light. - What have I done? - [Arture] Confront your shadows. - Help! Oh my gosh! Mom, Dad, just leave me alone. Since when have you guys cared anyway. Oh, this isn't funny! - [Arture] Parts of yourself that you're most ashamed of. - It's almost laughable how easy that test was. How did anybody not get an A? Okay, where I am? This doesn't compute, this doesn't make sense. What is going on, how did I get here? - Am I flying? I could wear fancy clothes and do my makeup and my hair. What's going on? I don't need that. - Where am I? Maybe they're right, I should stop eating junk food. - What's going on? What is this place? Are you kidding me? You think I need these stupid drills? - Fight your minds and open your hearts. - Whoa. (fire roaring) (dramatic music) - [Jessica] Come on, Mateo, I wanna get out of here. - It's magma, did you, the composition of magma-- - [Mateo] Just stay away from the edge. - Okay. - Watch your step. - Ah, it's hot. - Really, we're in a volcano. - Well, not technically, but I'm pretty sure that's lava. - Ah, this just keeps getting better. - Why are we still here? It's like we're camping but worse. I mean, we don't even have toilet paper. How am I supposed to live like this? - Didn't you learn anything back there? - Look. (gentle music) Thanks. - Watch it. - [Mateo] Wouldn't want to be the one to fall in there. (kids screaming) - Help! - Help us! - [Teddy] Oh my god! Two, three, four! - [Zoey] Oh my god, oh my god! - Thanks, guys. - Are you okay? - Yeah, thanks. - No problem. Come on, we're almost there. - She's right. (inspiring music) - [Zoey] Is that what I think it is? - It sure looks like it. (triumphant music) - Well, who's first? - Me, me! (dramatic music) - Are we sure we're ready for this? - Absolutely. (electrical whirring) - [Zoey] What's going on? - This is weird. (tense music) - Where's my stone? - We have been waiting for you. We have waited many hundreds of Earth years for the light to find you. - We followed the light and it led us here. - We are very grateful to you for bring to us the source. - When we were separated from the source, we had no way to get back home because the sources powers our ship. - Why did you call it the source? - We call the stone the source because that is what light is. It represents the beginning and the end. It holds all knowledge and all things. - So, the stone powers the ship, lights up, and shows us memories and other things like that? - It is a unique and creative essence that does much more than power a ship. - It taught us all something in the crystal cave. We saw these visions. - Only those with a will to see the stone for what it is are allowed its light. - That's what my grandma used to tell me. - Your grandmother was a wise being. - How am I, I mean, we supposed to tell everyone about this? - What is there to tell, young one? Lead by example, lead with love. I see greatness in all of you. And if you carry its message, so too will it pass to others. - [Arture] Kem. - [Kem] Captain, the eruption is commencing. We must leave now. (ship beeping) - Follow me. (dramatic music) - But what about my dad? - We're communicating with him right now. - [Arture] Embrace the light. - [Kem] I have him in transit now. - Carmen? Carmen? - Daddy! - Hey. Are you okay? Hey, guys, hey. How mom's necklace is powering this ship? - Yes, the source. - And now, we're traveling in an inter-dimensional vortex back to our planet? - We are taking you to your home. - Wow, this is a lot to take in. It's like a dream. I'm just glad you guys are okay. Oh god, I was so scared. - There is more. - [Thomas] What? - We feel a need to tell you and your daughter, precious one, your life is going to change once more. Our scan confirms, Carmen has three years, 173 days to live. - What? - We are truly very sorry. - I saw it in a vision in the crystal cave. - [Thomas] No. - There is another way, however. - [Thomas] What? What way? - Unfortunately, we need to keep the stone to power our ship back to our home planet. If Carmen so chooses, we may take her back to our home planet where she will be healed and have the opportunity to live a very long and meaningful life. However, only she may go, and you will be returned back to your planet and time. - You're not bad, kid. - [Carmen] You neither. - Thank you, Carmen. - [Carmen] For what? - Everything. - You're everything to me, and you will be every day for the rest of my life. - You don't have to be scared. Good will come of this. - I don't have a choice, do I? I love you so much, but I can't lose you too. I can't, I don't know how I can live. - Someday, you will see what I see, and hopefully, someday, you will forgive me for leaving you. - Hey, this isn't your fault. Listen, you didn't do anything wrong. I'm sorry, I'm sorry for not letting you be your own person. I'll always be right here. I love you so much. - I love you, Daddy. - We have learned that there is only one constant, and that is the light of love. (gentle music) Love will never separate you. You shall always be together. - It is time. - Take care of her. - [Arture] We are approaching now. (dramatic music) (sullen music) (spaceship whirring) (inspiring music) - You okay, Mr. Landry. - Everybody, call your parents. Let them know you're okay. - Hey, Mr. Landry. Thanks so much for having me over for dinner. She said you'd be home soon. - [Thomas] Who said? - Come on. (suspenseful music) (electrical whirring) - Is it really you? - Yes, Dad, it's me, it's really me. - But how? - There are no beginnings or ends. Time can only be defined by how you spend it and by how much love you share. I love you, Dad. (uplifting music) (dramatic music) - Source, source, source is back! The source. - Ah! - Right now, right now, the source is back. Do not fire! Go after the ship. Start the engines, fast, fast! After 5,723 years, finally, the source will be mine! Hurry after them. Why are we slowing down? Why are we slowing down. - I think-- - Hurry! - I think we're-- - What? - Out of gas. - Out of gas, out of gas! Out of gas? (spaceship crackling) (speaking in foreign language) - Ah! - In the end, the girl was healed by the aliens. She returned to Earth where she lived a long and happy life full of many other adventures. (chuckles) - I wanna meet aliens like that one day. - Well, you might. When you're working on another planet. (chuckles) - The dad never gave up on her. - No, he never lost hope. (gentle music) And they got along. And even though he almost lost her, he learned that a big part of love is accepting the fear that you can't, that you can't always protect the people you care about. - That was a great story. (Grandma laughing) - Feeling better? Hey, you ready for some dessert? - We don't need it. Mom wouldn't want us having it before bed. - So mature of you. You know that your mom loves you both more than the world. - Yeah, and she's always working to take care of us. - Yeah. - We're lucky to have you too, Grandma. (Grandma chuckles) - I'm luckier, and don't let those kids bother you. They're just lost and scared, hmm? You two, be brave. - I hope I get to have great adventures. - You will. It's in our destiny. (crystal whirring) - [Kids] Grandma? (dramatic music) (solemn music) (dramatic music) (uplifting music) (dramatic music)
