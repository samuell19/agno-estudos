A MAN STICKS TO HIS STANDARDS, HE'LL ALWAYS BE OKAY. IT'S WHEN HE STARTS OPERATING BELOW HIS STANDARDS... GETS HIMSELF IN TROUBLE. WHY ? HE BETRAYS HIMSELF. DID I BETRAY MYSELF WITH DIANE ? THAT'S A QUESTION ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER FOR YOURSELF. YOU KNOW. SHE MAKES YOU HAPPY, RIGHT ? I DON'T KNOW. I THINK SO. THE THING ABOUT DIANE IS, I WAS SO PROUD OF MYSELF FOR MARRYING HER. I DREAMT ABOUT HER IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND YEARS LATER, I CHASED HER AND I GOT HER, LIKE SHE WAS SOMETHING I EARNED. LIKE A TROPHY ? MAYBE. CHECK IT OUT. HMM ? 3:00. BORN TO BREAK HEARTS.

[ Laughing ] IT'S TOUGH TO FIND A MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP NOWADAYS. THAT'S WHY ALL I REALLY WANT IS TO FIND A WOMAN... WHO WILL LIKE ME FOR WHO I PRETEND TO BE WHEN I'M WITH HER. EXAMPLE: MY LAST GIRLFRIEND. TOO DEMANDING. SHE KEPT SAYING TO ME, "BARRY, I WANT TO GET TO KNOW THE REAL YOU. I WANT TO KNOW WHO YOU REALLY ARE." I SAID, [ Laughing ] "YOU ARE WAY OUTTA LINE. NOBODY GETS IN HERE. NOT EVEN ME." WHICH IS GOOD, BECAUSE I'M SHALLOW ENOUGH THAT WHEN I DO GET DEPRESSED, I DON'T EVEN KNOW IT. [ Laughing ] [ Woman ] BORING ! YOU KNOW YOU'VE BEEN HITTING ON ME ALL EVENING. NOT IN YOUR WILDEST DREAMS, YOU SEXIST, PERVERTED ASSHOLE. I WAS GONNA SLEEP WITH YOU BEFORE YOU SAID THAT, BUT NO.

I KNOW SHE'S YOUNG. MAYBE THERE'S ANOTHER GUY. NO. IN HER PAST OR SOMETHING, WASN'T SHE ENGAGED ? IT'S OVER. IT'S OVER. ALL I'M SAYIN' IS BE CAREFUL. I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT, BUT, BOY, WHEN I AM WITH HER... I FEEL SO-- WHAT'S THE WORD ? I FEEL SO... ACCEPTED. IT'S A VERY POWERFUL FEELING. AS OPPOSED TO BEING REJECTED, WHICH IS ALSO A VERY POWERFUL FEELING. [ Robert Laughing ] DID YOU SEE THE FACE ON THAT NUN... WHEN YOU DID THE SIMULTANEOUS ORGASM BIT ?

HE COULD BE YOUR PRESS AGENT. SHE'S GONNA BE HIGH UP IN THE ADMINISTRATION. PROBABLY SECRETARY OF FEMININE AFFAIRS. THAT'S THE RUMOR. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS A CABINET-LEVEL POST. IF BROWN'S ELECTED, SURE, YES. WE'RE ALREADY LOOKING FOR HOMES IN WASHINGTON. BIG HOMES. I'LL COMMUTE BACK TO L.A. FOR MY COMEDY GIGS AT GOVERNMENT EXPENSE, WHILE THEA MAKES MAJOR POLICY DECISIONS. WE'RE GONNA BE THE NEW POWER COUPLE OF D.C. PEOPLE MAGAZINE. COVER OF TIME. THE WHOLE BIT. IT'S GONNA BE GREAT FOR MY CAREER. I CAN NEVER TELL IF HE'S SERIOUS OR IF HE'S JOKING. I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE TAKES IT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE AGAINST HIM. I THOUGHT HE WAS FUNNY TONIGHT. AS A WOMAN, I WAS OFFENDED. THE MAN HAS PENIS ON THE BRAIN. HE'S SEXIST. HE OBJECTIFIES WOMEN. HE'S PART OF THE PROBLEM. WHAT PROBLEM ? YOU KNOW. "THE PROBLEM." YOU USED TO HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF HUMOR. SEE ? THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. YOU'RE HIS BIGGEST FAN. IT'S LIKE YOU WROTE HALF HIS MATERIAL. THAT'S NOT TRUE. WE JUST TALK A LOT. CHRIST, WE GREW UP TOGETHER. I DON'T KNOW IF "GREW UP" IS THE RIGHT WORD. [ Sighs ] OW ! W-WHAT'S THE MATTER ? AGH.

WE WOULDN'T EXACTLY BE LIVING TOGETHER IN THE CLASSIC SENSE. WE'D... WE'D BE ROOMMATES. WHO JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE SEX EVERY NIGHT. THAT'S NEGOTIABLE.

I JUST KNOW IT. SEE, THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH MEN. WE DON'T POOL OUR RESOURCES. WE DON'T SHARE OUR KNOWLEDGE. KNOW WHAT I'D LIKE... AS A GESTURE OF PEACE ? IF, AS A COURTESY TO GUYS, THEY'D HOLD A SYMPOSIUM, A SEMINAR, LIKE THEY DO IN THE SCIENTIFIC WORLD, AND SHARE WITH US THE TRICKS OF THEIR TRADE. THEIR TECHNIQUES. TECHNIQUES THAT HAVE BEEN PERFECTED FOR CENTURIES. HANDED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION. OTHERWISE, WE CAN'T COMPETE. ALL I WANT... IS A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. YEP.

DID YOU READ THE EXPOSE IN THE WEEKLY ? I WAS STUNNED. THIS COULD DESTROY THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ? WHEN JERRY WAS IN INDIA, HE MADE MILLIONS IN A KICKBACK SCHEME WITH MOTHER TERESA... SELLING DEFECTIVE CONDOMS TO THIRD-WORLD COUNTRIES. IT'S AN OUTRAGE. YOU ARE SUCH A DORK. I CAN'T HAVE YOU ABOUT HERE. WOULD YOU PLEASE MEET ME OUT FRONT ? HUH ? YEAH. I DO RESPECT WHAT YOU DO ! NO, YOU DON'T ! YOU BARGE INTO MY OFFICE. TO YOU IT'S ALL A GAME. YOU TREAT ME LIKE I'M A CHILD. IF YOU FEEL THAT, IT'S BECAUSE I'M A CHILD MYSELF. THAT'S THE FIRST HONEST THING YOU'VE SAID. I'VE BEEN DOING A LOTTA THINKING ABOUT THIS "SEEING PEOPLE" THING. IT'S DEFINITELY NOT A GOOD IDEA. YOU GIVE ME THAT GREEN LIGHT, WOMEN WILL BE HURLING THEMSELVES AT ME. I DON'T WANNA SEE YOU HURT. SPARE ME, BARRY. IT'S THE GOATEE GUY WITH THE TIE, RIGHT ? MUST BE "HEAL THE BAY," "SAVE THE SEALS," "JOE CONGRESS." I'M RIGHT, RIGHT ? I KNOW I'M RIGHT, BUT I'M RIGHT, RIGHT ? I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT THIS NOW. I KNEW IT. WHAT, "MR. POLITICALLY CORRECT" ? HE'S PROBABLY A STOCKBROKER, I'M TELLING YA. DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH ? 'CAUSE I'LL TELL YOU THE TRUTH IF YOU WANT. NO, I JUST-- I'D LIKE YOU TO TELL ME THAT YOU ONLY WANT TO BE WITH ME. I CAN'T SAY THAT. BUT WE'RE HAVING SUCH A GREAT TIME. WE BELONG TOGETHER. I DON'T WANT THAT NOW. TELL ME WHAT I CAN GET. YOU CAN'T ! WHY IS IT WOMEN LOOK THEIR MOST BEAUTIFUL RIGHT WHEN THEY'RE TELLING YA IT'S OVER ? IS IT A PLOT TO MAKE IT PAINFUL ? I'M NOT IN THE MOOD FOR YOUR ACT NOW. I USED TO HAVE AN INTEREST IN THAT PART OF YOUR ANATOMY. SHUT UP ! I'M SAYING, IF YOU WANNA BE A SLUT, BE A SLUT FOR ME. THAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH YOU. YOU ARE SO SELFISH !

I'M WILLING TO CHANGE. IT'S TOTALLY NEGOTIABLE. I DIDN'T WANT IT LIKE THIS. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FUN. YEAH ! THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT ! WHAT ? FUN. BARRY, I-- WHAT ? I JUST WANT TO BE FRIENDS, OKAY ? YOU ARE MY FRIEND. YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND. NO, I MEAN-- I MEAN JUST FRIENDS. JUST FRIENDS. SPECIAL FRIENDS. OKAY, SPECIAL FRIENDS. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. SO, OKAY-- WHY DON'T WE DO THIS THEN ? WHY DON'T WE STRIP ME NAKED, PEEL THE SKIN OFF MY BODY, POUR GASOLINE OVER ME AND LIGHT ME ON FIRE ? 'CAUSE THAT'S GONNA BE A LOT LESS PAINFUL THAN BEING "JUST FRIENDS." YOU'RE NOT LEAVING ME WITH A LOT OF OPTIONS. THE WAY I SEE IT, RELATIONSHIPS ARE A LOT LIKE... THOSE SPIKES YOU SEE AT THE ENTRANCES TO PARKING LOTS. YOU SEE THOSE THINGS ? SURE, THEY'LL LET YOU IN EASY ENOUGH, BUT JUST TRY BACKING OUT. "SEVERE TIRE DAMAGE," IF YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

TALK ABOUT A DESPERATION, "HAIL MARY" PASS. WITH NO TIME LEFT ON THE CLOCK. YOU'D THINK IF YOU LOVE SOMEONE HARD ENOUGH, THEY HAVE TO LOVE YOU BACK OUT OF COMMON COURTESY. UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S NOT HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS. AFTER EVERYTHING SHE PUT ME THROUGH, I COULD NEVER GO BACK TO HER. UNLESS, OF COURSE, SHE ASKED ME. FORGET ABOUT HER ALREADY ! THERE'S PLENTY MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OLD BARRY ? WHEN I WAS MARRIED, YOU WERE MY HERO. YOU SHOULD FIND BETTER ROLE MODELS. SO ? WHAT DO YOU THINK ? IT'S GREAT. IT'S GREAT. YEAH. DIVORCE. THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME. THANK GOD FOR LESBIANS. COME IN. IF I CAN'T GET LAID NOW, I HAVE A LEGITIMATE EXCUSE FOR SUICIDE.

I'M TELLIN' YA, IT'S LIKE SHOOTING FISH IN A BARREL. THE PLACE IS LOADED WITH WOMEN. THERE'S MORE DESPERATION IN THAT ROOM THAN ON THE TITANIC. WHAT'S IT CALLED ? "JOURNEY TO THE MIRACULOUS." WOMEN GO CRAZY FOR IT. COME ON. IT'S JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED. THE TRICK IS NOT TO FIND THE MEANING OF LIFE. [ Laughs ] THAT IS WAY TOO BIG A TASK ! THE TRICK IS TO FIND THE MEANING IN YOUR OWN LIFE. THAT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN DO ! NOW, "THE JOURNEY TO THE MIRACULOUS" SAYS... THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT EXISTS ONLY IN A WHAT ? RELATIONSHIP ! THE KEY TO THE INNER TEMPLE CAN ONLY BE FOUND... THROUGH THE INNER TEMPLE OF ANOTHER. THE PATH TO YOUR OWN SOUL IS ONLY ACCESSIBLE THROUGH ANOTHER SOUL. NOW, HOW DO YOU FIND THAT PERSON, THAT SOUL ? HOW DO YOU GET THE TRAIN TO STOP AT YOUR STATION ? HOW DO YOU INVOKE THAT LIGHT UNTO YOURSELVES ? WE LIVE IN TWO STATES. A STATE OF LOVE, WHICH IS A STATE OF INNOCENCE, AND A STATE OF FEAR. WHEN WE LIVE IN A STATE OF FEAR, WE BECOME JUDGMENTAL, CRITICAL. WE EXPRESS NEGATIVE KARMA ONTO OUR PARTNER, AND THEREFORE BACK ONTO OURSELVES. "THE JOURNEY TO THE MIRACULOUS" TELLS US... THAT WITHIN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE IS THE CAPACITY FOR FORGIVENESS. AND WITHIN THE CAPACITY FOR FORGIVENESS... IS THE TRUE CAPACITY FOR LOVE. FORGIVENESS, LOVE. LOVE, FORGIVENESS. TWO CONCEPTS, RIGHT ? WRONG, PEOPLE ! IT'S ONE AND THE SAME ! TO FORGIVE IS TO LOVE, AND TO LOVE... IS TO FORGIVE. [ Driver ] THIS IS IT. WATCH OUT FOR REPUBLICANS. COME ON, WE GOTTA GO.
