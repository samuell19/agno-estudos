Okay. My name is Mark Gentile. I was born in Acerenza, Italy. I never knew my father, he died before I was born. I immigrated to the United States with my mom in the mid 60's and, well, education was very important to my mother. I worked hard, and after high school I went to university, eventually getting a degree in law. I met the love of my life, Marina, a Canadian graphic designer. She convinced me to move to Toronto. Big fucking mistake. Shortly after we were married, our daughter Laura was born. Maybe that's too much detail. I... I just... I've been with Santius Automotive for seven years. Gordon Welsh was my friend, my mentor. He moved me into management and then gave me the awesome responsibility of being chief executive officer. I proudly hold that position today. We are finding ways to minimize the environmental damage caused by our products... See, you could rephrase that. Why?! Well, you don't want to sound negative about our cars. Oh. Well, that's a good point. We continue our commitment to ensure that Santius remains affordable and sustainable. You know, why don't you just stick with your achievements? Why don't you forget about all the personal stuff. I know Gordon always used to encourage that kind of thing, but, um, you know Barbara, she... she's... she rolls her eyes at that kind of stuff. No, no, no, Gordon was right. I mean, of course the presentation needs to be relatable. You know, forgive me but Barbara doesn't quite do "relatable." But do we care what Barbara thinks? What we do need to care about is the fact that you need to get out of here if you're going to be on time. All right, we got to go. - I'm ready. - All right, let's do it. - Mark. - What's up? Thank God I found you. I begged them not to make you do this. Begged who? The board. I fought for you, I really did, but they insisted. What's this? A revised presentation. The board said there's merit to your recommendation, but our shareholders need to know that we're going to be profitable. Major green initiatives are expensive. In the beginning. Look, Mark, I tried. Believe me. I made that man a promise. A promise I don't plan to break. And one day you'll make good on that promise. Just not today. Ladies and gentlemen, Mark Gentile. And so in order to... ensure sustainability... for your investments... Uh... Uh... Mark? In here. Um, what are you, uh...? What are you doing home so early? Taste. Oh. Okay. Mmm. Very nice. Thank you. Um, I can't remember the last time you cooked. Or shopped. Sit. Okay. Mm. Thank you. Here, let me take that. Mmm. Very nice. Well, if you like that, take a look at this. Where are we going? - Italy. - Italy! Oh, my gosh! Mark. Oh, my gosh. So... Wow, what's the... what's the... What's the occasion? Well, I need to... I need to... I needed to get outta here. I mean, not here, here, you know, But Santius. I took a leave. Uh, permanently. You... you what? Uh, no, but it's... it's, uh... It's a good thing. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, this is a good thing. It's a good thing. And here I thought all of this was... What? For once after us being distant for so long you were actually trying to do something romantic. I was, I am. I mean... Wait, we're "distant"? But you... You sleep in Laura's room. Yeah, I've been working late. Why did you quit your job? Wait, does it have something to do with the presentation today? I... Honey, I was... I was standing there, you know, and... In front of all those people and I'm thinking "How many good years do I have left?" And I... I had this epiphany. Oh, my God, men and their epiphanies. You can't just quit your job. I mean, we haven't even discussed this, we haven't talked about anyth... I mean, when... when were you thinking of leaving? - Tomorrow. - Tomorrow?! But I'm working tomorrow! Call in sick. I can't just call in... I mean, how long are we going for? Oh, my Gosh, it's an open ended... It's a first class open ended ticket. Have you lost your mind? Mark, what the fu...? - Here you go. - Gratzi. Good evening. So are you visiting Italy for business or pleasure? Oh, I don't know. You fly all the way here from America... Canada. Same thing. You flew all the way here and you don't know why? That's how you wind up on a watch-list, sir. I have to tick a box. Where are you staying? Acerenza. My grandfather's. And what are you doing there? Visiting. Ah, now we're getting somewhere. You are going to visit your grandfather? No, he's dead. And you're just showing up now? I'll put "pleasure". You work it out on your own. Welcome to Italy. Arrivederci. Goodbye. See you tomorrow. C'mon, Amelia! Jump! On your marks. Get set. Go! Hurry, I want to beat the train! Bye Marco! See you tomorrow. Bye, Marco! Bye, Luca! Well done, Marco. You just barely beat it. Soon, we will have to find a more worthy opponent for you. Let's go. Shut up, you. Next stop, Acerenza. Cathedral city. Acerenza. Excuse me. Excuse me. Perdonami. Um, taxi. Uh... Um... Acerenza. There are no taxis here. Oh. There's a bus. Ah, grazie. Buon giorno. Buon giorno. Excuse me? Excuse me. Sir! That's my bag. What the hell do I care? Let me see it! Take your hands off it. Give it to me. Leave it. My bag. What do I care? Now it's mine! Leave the bag alone. Am I under arrest? There's a report of a gang of banditi. And I... I look like a bandit to you? Could be. ID please. It's in my bag. And where is... this bag? - It's behind...! - The bag, the bag, oh! You're pissing me off. Ow! Oh, Bello, You're under arrest. you got a lot of nerve coming back here like this without even calling, Marco Gentile. Huh? - How long we know each other? - What?! "What?" You were this high, and I was this small. You looked right through me, and I knew you the second I see you. I was sure it was you. - Luca? - Si, Luca. Oh my God. Luca Morrani? - Mm-hmm. - Oh! I didn't recognize you. The... The mustache. Yeah, my mustache looks good. I grew up a little bit. Stop it! Don't move! You are under arrest okay?! The driver thinks I'm arresting you. Word goes around very fast in this town. You're under arrest, handsome. Come on. - Ow, can you loosen these things? - Shut up! - Americano shut up! - Ow! Open the door! You have, uh, much crime here on the mean streets of Acerenza? Well, Marco. It's not like it used to be, you know. I can't remember what it used to be. I haven't been back in 45 years. I tell you what happened two days ago, okay? Antonio's dog was barking, and he woke up Canio Cataldo's dog. So, he came out of his balcony and starts screaming "Hey, your dog, he woke me up. I'm going to kill him." And Antonio said, "You get close to my dog, I'm going to bomb your house." He has a gun, the other one has a bomb. Lots of weapons. Yes, it's crazy. Very dangerous. - Rough! - Molto rough. Rough. Where you taking me? Come in. Don't move. Stay right there. Everyone! Your attention, please. This is a very important event for Acerenza. This very dangerous American criminal - Canadian. Canada, say America, it's the same shit. Anyway, this desperate criminal was born and raised here in Acerenza, Then against his will, he was taken to Canada. No, not against my will. I make it more dramatic. Anyway. I'm going to show you. Now he's under my custody, right? This gentleman's name... is Marco Gentile. Oh, you remember him? Marco Gentile. Yes, I remember him well. Even his grandfather. My nonno? Marco Gentile. - Ciao! - Ciao! Peppino, off you go. - Marco. - Si. Remember me? Amelia! Ame...? Little Amelia? Oh, I... It's nice to see you all grown up! How are you? You turned out beautiful. Oh, thank you. - Oh-ah! - Oh, oh, oh! Ay, oh. Boom, boom! Eh. Laura? Hey. We haven't spoken in three years and you're already back to nicknames? Well, well, I... I'm just glad you called. Well, I'm not calling for you, Dad. I'm calling for mom. Ho, Marco! Ho! Are you at a party? Uh, yes. Luca. I ran into him. He's taken me to Bandini's. Accordion music. Who is Luca? My friend. Mom is very worried. No, no, I wanted her to come. I begged her to come. Yeah, I heard. I just don't understand why you needed to go... Marco. I remember when we were kids... This coming from the guy who lost his shit when I needed to figure things out. You are unbelievable. Yeah, right. While you and yours were stealing olives from ours. What? Look, it's... it's not the same. Well, you know it's not about you, Dad. Laura, you quit school. And I didn't call to get into... Hello? Hello? Lau? Dad? Ah, Marco! Marco, I deputize him to drive us back home. And tonight... you will stay with me. No, I can't. I... I have to stay at mio nonno. His grandfather's? You drunkards. Let's go. What's wrong? This is the Imposta Municipale Unica. Property tax. No. This land is ours. It belongs in the family. My nonno's estate... must have been able to cover the taxes. Marco, when they make me put up the sign I tried to reach you. No phone, no Facebook, no address, nothing. Well, I'm going over. No, no, no. As an officer of the law, I can't allow that. But as your friend, I'll give you boost. Give me your foot. Come here. Shit, he's heavy. Deputado, you boost. Stop calling me Deputy. I'm your nephew. Push, push, push. Okay... Oh! God damn. That's a good lock, huh? You're totally insane, uncle! Take this. Good night. Good night. Let's go. - Honestly, Mark... - Calm down, Dad. I am calm! - Is that why you're yelling? - Nobody's yelling! Do you know how proud your mother and I were that you even got into McGill? So she's isn't going to your alma mater, sweetie. It's not the end of the world. What are you, the counsel for the defense? Three semesters she's been out of school. Three! Dad, people take time off. Y-yes, they do. Of course they do, and hopefully they have the courtesy of telling their parents they dropped out! Over a year you've been out of school, not living at home, - we don't know where! - Shh, shh. I mean, I'll be sending checks for books, for tuition. You say nothing! Are you on drugs? Do I look like I'm on drugs? How would I know? Where are you going? Laura! Laura! Oh, my God. I wasn't through. Yeah, well, yell louder. That's obviously getting through to her. What else was I supposed to do? I don't know, Mark. Anything but that. Who's shooting? - Ho! - Ah! Nonno! Come! Let's go pick some of Morrani's olives. Why are you throwing stones? This is your room. It's more fun down here. Come on! Okay. What if they catch us? We're not stealing! It's a trade. They take our figs, we take their olives. Everyone's happy. Nonno, if it's not stealing why are we doing it at night? Because dreams are more beautiful in the moonlight. The best ones are up high. No, no, no. It won't hold me. I-I-I'm an old man. Of course it will hold you. You're just a boy. I don't see the point in all this subterfuge. Subterfuge. I don't know the meaning of that word. But we have an unspoken agreement with Morrani. If we took their olives in daylight, then we'd have to talk about it. Then it wouldn't be unspoken. But Nonno, it just doesn't make sense. Bambino, look at the moon. Smell the air. Listen to the wind through the trees. Why would you give up all of this? Why give all this up just to make things make sense? Aye! Damn you. You disgrace. I'll cut you! Cut you! But you, you're beautiful. You're even more beautiful. I'll give you a kiss. Will you kiss me back? I'm not kissing you. Hello! Enzo! I told you a thousand times to stay away from the house. Get out of here. Uh, no, uh... Eh? You're not Enzo. Mark. Gentile. The lawyer Gentile? I used to help Canio Gentile when he lived here. I used to call him Uncle Canio. He taught me how to do everything here. This is all him. He was great. Um... What are you doing here now? The town pays me to keep the place nice. But I don't keep it too nice, or else they'll sell it. Who's, um... Enzo? Enzo. Never mind Enzo. Marcello. Hey, Marcello. Mark. Marco. Ah, Marco. So what do you think? I do this all by myself. Si. Very nice. I keep the vines healthy. Barely. I talk to the vines whether they are good or bad. Otherwise, they feel abandoned and they forget their purpose. Understand? Um, are there... many wine makers left? No, no, no. The vineyards were abandoned long ago. Acerenza's youth no longer live here. Here, there's only one man who makes wine. Who? Me! I make a few cases each year. Always in the memory of your grandfather. But I also like to drink. A little. Are you hungry? Enjoy your meal. Grazie. Buona. Ah, si. Have you gone to see your grandfather? Um, no, not yet. When, uh... mio nonno morte I was fresh out of college. Married, mi amore, mia bambina... responsibility. You know how it is. Go. Go see him. Good morning. Okay, who is that guy? Enzo. He's particular. Special. He lives here. Not in the house. Outside. He refuses to leave. He doesn't want to. Wait, squatting? He's squatting here? Si, si. He lives in a shack at the back of the property. I tried to get him evicted, but he doesn't want to. He says he has rights. It's the law. I can't do anything about it. My hands are tied. Hello. Are you coming? Oh! When supper was ended he took the cup. Again he gave you thanks and praise. He gave the cup to his disciples and said, take this, all of you, and drink from it. This is the cup of my blood, the blood of the new and everlasting covenant. It will be shed for you, so that sins may be forgiven. Do this in memory of me. Blood of Christ. Blessed are you, Lord, God of all creation. Through your goodness we have this wine. To offer fruit of the vine and work of human hands. So it will become our drink of salvation. Blessed be the Lord over the centuries. Receive us humble and repentant, O Lord. May our sacrifice, which is fulfilled before you, be acceptable to you. Wash me, Lord, clean from all guilt. Purify me from all sin. Pray, brethren, that our sacrifice, may be acceptable to God, the Almighty Father. Pray, brethren, that our family gathered in the name of Christ can offer sacrifice to God, the Almighty Father. Mark, thanks for coming. H-how are you feeling, Gordo? That's for Doctor Applebaum here to determine. Barbara, thanks for coming. Mark, you know Barbara. So, how are the grandkids, Gordon? Mark, listen, as far as soulless attorneys go, you're one of the best. Not just legally speaking. You've got a mind for business. Right... right into it, huh? I'm sorry. How are Marina and Laura? They're not talking to me. Excellent. So where were we? You were buttering Mark up by disparaging his profession. You're damn straight I was. Thank you. You okay? Mark. When I decided to make cars, everybody told me I was nuts. They said the market competition was too stiff to make a dent. So you know what I did? Ignored them and did it anyway. Bingo. So my question to you, Mark, is this. How would you like to run this outfit? What? Whether it's in a courtroom or in a boardroom, you never cut a corner, break your word, or take the easy way out. You'll do the right thing once I'm gone. But don't worry, you'll be working alongside me until you're ready to take over. The board will make sure of this. The body of Christ? The body of Christ. Uh... Amen. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. I welcome you in the name of God. Talk to me, son. Forgive me, father... You can speak English. Thank you. It's been, uh... a long time since my, uh, last confession. I don't know where to start, I... made a promise to this dying man and I betrayed that trust. Betrayed in what way? Uh... Yeah, by trade I'm a lawyer. Maybe you are beyond salvation, my son. What? Forgive me. It's a joke. Look, I'm trying to be serious here, Father. I betrayed my own ethics. How is that a sin? I gave him my word. The man was dying, and I promised him, and I lied. So then, rectify what you did. Oh, I can't, I... I quit in protest. You ran away? Cowardice is not a virtue. But it's not a mortal sin. I don't know what to do. Get over yourself. The real sin here is your obsession about your mistake. The answer lies in service to something other than yourself. To God? God doesn't need a lawyer. To who then? It's for you to decide. God bless you. What, no Hail Marys? - Buon giorno. - Buon giorno. I'm sorry, Nonno. I'm sorry I... I took so long. I wasn't there for you. Jesus, I sound like an asshole. Yes, you do. Didn't we already talk last night? I needed to apologize. Why are you worrying? You made your choices and now you live with remorse. Apologizing to the dead now doesn't change anything. Maybe now you can make better choices. Marco, this land is part of you. Italy? Ha! This land. My land. Cheers. Done? Done. Marcello! Marcello! Let's make a little wine. Laywer, what's up? We're open. What do you mean, "make some wine"? You want to grow here? To sell grapes? - Impossible. - Why? There's only two of us. Two men. We need other people. Ah, Acerenza has people. Acerenza is full of old people. - The youth have all gone. - We'll get 'em. No, no, not a good idea. You don't even own this land! You're a squatter. Like Enzo! No. I own it. I paid off the back taxes. This is good news. Oh! Nice going, Serpico. No, this is not a good idea. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning Amelia. Can I make an announcement? Go ahead. Are you preparing to run for mayor? Nice girl. Tell them I'm making pastries with ricotta. If they pay for one, I'll give them two. Attention. Attention. Well then... Silence! Marco Gentile's got something to announce. Thank you. I'm thinking of reopening my grandfather's vineyard. You're thinking of? Or are you actually going to? I'm thinking of going to the moon. Okay, have a good trip! How many? It depends. It depends on them. Why? Marco, what do you expect? We've all been here for many years. We're hard workers, but full time jobs are difficult to find. This could be that. You're dreaming. Sometimes... dreams come true. Can I give you some advice? If you build this vineyard in honor of your grandfather, it can become everyone's dream. Not only for you. but for everybody. Are you crazy? There's no jobs here. What jobs? The vineyard. Who sent you here? He said he's opening the vineyard. Who told you that? He looks angry, Marcello. Si? Si. The foreigner. What foreigner? Him! Lawyer! I already told you! To reopen the winery and harvest everything is not a good idea. Why? My grandfather, he did it. What's the harm in trying? Let your grandfather's soul rest in peace. He would sell wine off the back of a donkey! He says your grandfather used to sell Vino with... How do you call the animal... 'Hee-haw, hee-haw'? - How do you say it? - So, it's... So we'll get a donkey! Okay, lawyer. You want to go broke? It's up to you. Me? I'm going home. - Mm. He's going home. - Go! - Wait, I need him. - Yeah, just call him. - No, no, hey! Marcello! - Call him, call him! I don't know how to make wine! Marcello! Lawyer. You want to make a case or two of wine? It's my pleasure to help you. But this idea... This gives everyone false hope! I want no part of it. I better not translate, I mean, he's mad, okay? Does anyone know how to make wine here? Nobody. Nobody. Okay, so we Google it. We Goog... Um. We'll search for it with Google. Okay, let's go. Marina Gentile. Mrs. Gentile, Bryan Jessup here. Oh, hi, Bryan. How are you? Oh, fine, fine. I was just sorry to see that your husband closed your retirement account. I tried calling him, - but he didn't answer... - I'm sorry. He did what? Here's 70, 80, 90... 110, 150... That's it. Okay, buona sera. - Tomorrow? - Yes, si. Same time, same place. - Tomorrow. Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. Oh, piacere. He forgot his... Okay. Oh! Michelino! Ciao. - Hey! - Oh, hey, honey, I-I'm so sorry, I... - Is he not back yet? - No! Nothing! - What is he doing? - I don't know! I think the medical term for it is "losing his fucking marbles." Let's look into flights. Oh, sweetheart. Oh, you don't have to do this. Mom, don't worry about it. This job is gonna be here when I get back. - Trust me. - I know, but... but, honestly you don't have to come with me. He is not your problem. Mom, you are not going alone. Look at him... Feeling the soil like he knows what he's doing. "I smell nutrients. Look at me! I'm the dirt whisperer." Who does this desk jockey think he is? He's a corporate stooge. A company man. He thinks he can make wine! You don't know what you're talking about. I was born here. You were a kid when you left, Marco Gentile. You didn't even come back for Nonno's funeral! And now you're bald! You want to reopen this place? Take my advice. Forget it! Go home. We don't need guys like you around here! Guys like me? Yeah, you'll screw up this place like you screwed up your life! My life is good. Really? How's Marina? Or Laura? Do you ever talk to your daughter? Will you...? You're crazy! Says the guy who's talking to a plant. Shut up! Shut up! Good evening, miss. Marcello. Over there. Thank you very much. Over there. Marcello! Marcello! Que? The vines are yelling at me. What did they say to you? They were generally nasty. If the vines talk back, it's you talking. Maybe you should listen? No, no, no. I got to do this. I... I don't even know why. But it could be good. For the people, the town, maybe even me. It's only one vineyard. Only one vine. You understand? It's not the saviour of Acerenza. And neither are you! Understand? I'll take you home in the morning and see what kind of mess you've made of my vineyard. You're gonna help me? If you want to go crazy, that's your business. You want to make wine? That's mine. Si, I help you. So we need an irrigation line? Do you know what type of grapes these are? Don't be a wise ass. They're red. In this region, only one grape grows - Aglianco. Aglianico. Aglianico can not be irrigated. Okay. No water. Only the rain. Natural water. Si. From God, okay. To make irrigation for one plant, you need permission. Permission from the Aglianco jury. Okay, no permission. Water from God. Marco, there are no shortcuts. With Aglianco del Vulture there are a lot of rules. You need patience... ...and love. And money. The finest flavours of Basilicata in one bottle. When you drink it, it's full-bodied, very red. It cleanses your mouth. We harvest in the fall. Now let's take a look at the barrels. No, no, no, no. It's not enough. We're going to need more. The best is French oak. Well, what's that going to cost? I just paid 20 years in back-taxes. Don't worry. I know a man who can get us many barrels. If it rains, it'll be no good. Lawyer. It's time. I... twelve people... To work in the fields. Yeah. We need twelve people to work in the fields. Is lunch included? He want to know if lunch included. - For 20 workers? - Yes! Um... we'll see. Bene! Signora, bene. Okay, let's go to work. Prego. - Hello. - Salve. Posso. - Hello. - Hi. Are you traveling to Italy for business or for pleasure? Um... Don't tell me. You're going to Acerenza? How did you know that? Just a hunch. Hold on. Buon giorno. Has the day arrived? What day? The day of my eviction. But I'm not going without a fight. - I'm not... - Hold on a minute. Are you even the legal owner of this property? Enzo was here before you! Uh, I'm not going to evict you. Ah. Come in. Grazie. Sorry. Uh, you, uh... take the nice... chair. Grazie. You're welcome. Y-you have... connections for, uh, the barrels? The Vino. The Vino. Ah, si, si. Fabbrica, uh... Factory! - Si. - Si. I need you to help me purchase many barrels. No, no. Enzo retire. What are you talking about? You're mid-forties? I take a "early retirement." Okay? I can not help you. I don't think I'm making myself clear. I... I just need an introduction, I'll pay you. I said I can not help you. Arrivederci. But... but you don't understand, I need... Ciao! Ciao, ciao! We have arrived. Marco! Look who I found. Oh! How'd you find 'em? At the train station. What? Taking another nap? For you it's a nap. For me it's watching who comes and goes. Oh! Aw, why didn't you call me? I decided it was best we just show up. Uh... How are you, Laura? It's weird to see you without a suit on. Ah, yeah, it... it's just as weird for me to be working with my hands Marcello! I'm so glad you're here. You're just in time for the harvest. Hey! This is my wife and mi figlia. Marina and Laura! - Pleased to meet you. - Oh. Marcello. What a beautiful girl. Just like the mother. - Pleased to meet you. - Hi... Oh. Right, two. Hi. Hello. Um, so, what... what harvest? The grapes. I'm reopening my Nonno's vineyard. You're reopening the vineyard? - Uh-huh. - Is that why you cleared out our retirement fund? Uh... I needed money for, uh, back-taxes and, uh, wages. - Oh. - Had to turn on the electricity. Uh... uh... But... but let me show you your house. I'm gonna show them the house. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - The house? - Yeah, well, you just stay with them. Stay with them. What is even happening? What are you doing? Come, come. Your mother's out like a light. Well, that's probably because she hasn't slept since you've been gone. So, can I ask you something? Of course. What the fuck, Dad? Hey! This mid-life crisis vacation is not fair to Mom. It's not a mid-life crisis vacation. Then what? Because whatever it is, I think we... That she... deserves to hear about it. It's complicated. It's not. You had a hissy fit and walked out on your job, on your wife, on your life. When I... When I quit, I wasn't angry. I... I felt like I had to run. You know, uh, I can actually relate to that. I quit school because I felt all this pressure from you. And it was so heavy. And I felt so lonely. And all I did was complain about money. Well, I tried to talk to you about it, Dad. I did and you didn't want to hear any of it. When?! What, you want dates? Because I... I don't remember! But what I do I remember is, is needing to go to the exact same school as you and be exactly the same as you and you never left any fucking space for me. You... you spend all this energy trying to turn me into you. And you... you cast a hell of a shadow, Dad. I'm really glad you came. Comfortable? Listen, Mark, when we get home, you need to book an appointment with Dr. Rosenfeld. You just got here! Yeah, well. We are flying home in two days. I... I can't. - You have to. - Don't I get a say? - No! - Can we please talk about it? Oh, you want to talk about it now? Now you want to talk about it? Do you know you gave me 12 hours to drop everything and follow you on some cockamamie trip to Italy? You disappear for... for weeks. You clean out our retirement fund! You didn't want to talk about any of that, though! - Marina... - Did I get a say? Did I? Okay, what else do you want to talk about? How you would spend six, sometimes seven days a week at the office? Well, I mean, of course that's when you had a job, but quitting wasn't something you felt the need to talk to me about. And then I arrive here and you're running a vineyard and you're making wine like you're Francis fucking Coppola and it doesn't even warrant a call to your wife! I want to be a team, I really do. It's what I signed up for. But... if you have changed your mind about that, let me know. Two days. We should have these talks more often. Hey you guys. Where are you? Hey, guys, we're back in business. That's not what I heard! I heard you got two days. Hey, don't worry about that. Marco, why are you doing this? He's doing what the priest said. Serving someone other than himself. He wants to be an altruist! So? What's wrong with that? Can I get a little support here? Okay, but it won't be easy. So. What's easy? Sure, but we have a union! We'll have demands! Okay, I'll hear them. Don't listen to him. That one's a communist. Oh-ho! Spoken like a true fascist! Come on. Can I count on you guys? Atención a tutti! We're back in the wine business! Thank you. Thank you. Do you believe this? A wine union! I ask you. Who were you talking to? - When? - Just now. Myself. No. I was talking to the vines. You're talking to the plants. They seem to like it. Marcello does it all the time. Sometimes he yells at them. Oh. Did you tell him we're flying back? Oh, I certainly did. He's talking to the vines now. You know, I am standing right here. So is this like a "Field of Dreams" thing? If you brew it, he will come? Voices telling you to make Chianti? That's how much you know. You can't grow Chianti here. Ours are Aglianico grapes. Aglianico del Vulture. Ah brava! Our bella knows her wine! You're not encouraging my husband's delusional behaviors, are you? Excuse me please. What's going on? Is there a party here? You have your hands in your pockets? The vineyard is over there. Let's get to work! Let's get to work. Hey, Deputy! I came for crowd control. Special duty. It's like stopping a moving freight train. I don't know what to do. We stay on course. He's coming home and that's all there is to it. - Ciao. - Ciao. My name is Gio. I'm Laura. Pleased to meet you. It's raining, but it's beautiful at any time. Mm-hmm. I'm Italian. No, I can see and hear that, yes. You are make here from Canada? Yes. ♪ Life is a highway ♪ ♪ I want to ride it all night long ♪ Tom Cochrane! Do you know him? Yeah, we're neighbors. Yeah. We live next to each other. - Oh! - Oh! Ah! What planet am I on? Italia. Yeah. It's close to Mars. Do you like it thus far? I like it, yeah. I like it. It's a little cold... Uh... Colder than I thought. A little bit more than I thought. The movies don't show you that. Hold on, Marco. Hold on. When you push the cap down the gas comes up from the bottom. It's carbon dioxide. CO2 Don't breathe in the gas. You'll faint. You look at the candles. If the light in the candles is out, it's dangerous. It means there's no oxygen. You understand? You have to run out... leave the door open. Candles. Blow 'em out if you don't want to start a fire. - You understand? - Si. Hey, Papa. - Mr. Marco! - Ho! Oh, scusi. Um, can I make talk with you? Si. Enzo used to work at the barrel company. But, they, you know, close. Um... It was no good. I... I lose, uh, my wife. My house. I move into this shack. Eh, it's the story of Enzo. Well, I'm sorry for your trouble, Enzo. Oh, no, no. No, you don't understand. Before you open, when people see Enzo uh, in the town, they say "Go away Enzo! You stink! You bum!" But now, when they see me they smile. You have made Acerenza very happy. Thank you. I, uh... I still have friends at the barrel company. Enzo is retire no more. You want barrel? Enzo get you barrel. Well, I need barrels. Thank you. Prego. Okay! Let's go. - Come on... - What, no... I know we're leaving tomorrow, but you've got to try this at least once. Are there not machines for this sort of thing? Yes, but Marcello says that he wants to do 30 percent of the wine in the traditional way as good luck. - Uh, he does, does he? - Uh-huh. It's the secret ingredient. Foot fungus is your secret ingredient? - Get in. - Here. Watch out for the stems. How does it feel? Ew! Ew! I can feel the grapes popping under my feet. Oh! Marina, you look like, uh, right there... You look like... like Audrey Hepburn in the movie with Gregory Peck. In Rome, the Trevi Fountain, when they're splashing around in the water... - Wait, "Roman Holiday"? - Yeah. - No, you have your movies mixed up. - Huh? You're thinking of Anita Ekberg and Marcello Mastroianni in the Trevi fountain. W-what was the name of the movie? Come on, you don't remember the name of that movie? No, you're the artsy movie aficionado. Please, I'm not an aficionado of anything. I haven't done anything arty in years, unless you count dental floss bus ads. Ooh! I don't know if I want to kiss a man with purple feet. Am I... Am I chasing you for a kiss or... a movie title? "La Dolce Vita". Yes. It is a sweet life. No, silly, that's the title of the movie! Okay, what happened? Uh... er, I... You know, I was just thinking that maybe I would... I would stay another... A couple of days. Oh, my God... You had sex in the wine! No, it's not wine yet. Yeah, I'm never gonna be able to drink wine again. No, we didn't! - Can I talk to you for a minute? - Mom! This is... I know... So... Is everything okay? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Is everything purple? Uh... No, not... not everything. No, you sure? Let me check. Don't lie to me, Marco. Don't lie to me. You're kidding, right? Well, what's another couple of days? Mom! After he left you? After he's risking your entire future. Everything you guys have built together. Look, I really think you need to take him away from this fairy tale. Listen... Look, I'm having a hard time looking at you while you're purple. Oh, I know! I can't... I can't fly when I'm purple. Try explaining this to customs, huh? Mom, I have to get home, though. I have an actual life. You get that right? I know you do. I'm just... I was just hoping that you might consider spending a little while longer. - Just a tiny little bit. - Don't do that! You sure those are wine stains or are you just drinking the Kool-Aid? Oh, you're funny. You're a funny girl. Come on, just think about it. - Mom, maybe don't get so close to me because... - Why? I feel like this purple's contagious. No! Midway through the passage of life's journey, I found myself in a dark forest, where the right path was lost. - Come on, come on. Dad! - Marco... Come on! Dad? There we go. There we go. Okay. Hey. Are you okay? Did you not see that the candles were out? What candles? Mom, they're a fail safe. From the punch down gas. There's too much CO2 in here. You have to air it out before you come charging in to work - Take it easy! - Dad! Dad, Dad! Take it easy. Okay, let me get him... Okay. Okay, okay. It's okay. We're right here. How do you know all that? How did he not know that? You could've fallen in the vat and drowned. Oh! What a way to go. Grazie! Thank you so much. Ciao! You rebooking your flight? - No, I did that already. - Oh! Yes, I did do that. I was just talking to the... Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita. Is that the wine board? Uh, yeah, more or less. Basically, if Dad wants to be taken seriously, he has certified by the DOCG. - Otherwise he's just gonna be another amateur winemaker. - Mm. Uh, so now I'm an amateur? Uh, no. I was just saying to Mom that you have to be certified. - Oh. - Yeah. - And crazy. - Well... So how are you feeling? Okay. I was on a call with these guys, they said you have to be certified. There's a process and these are the steps you have to go through. - So you're not going home? - Well, I am leaving. But I think if you're gonna do this insane thing, you might as well do it right. Oh, thank you, bella. Thinking about joining the organization? No, no, but you do... Listen to me! You have to bring in your samples by Friday or else you have to do this next year. - Mm. - You have an appointment at 11:00. No, wait. The samples are not gonna be ready. You have vats full of them. No, it's not wine. It's gotta be put into barrels, then... then aged. Er, it takes a year. While your wine is aging, what are you gonna do? Wait. Why don't you come back home and then you can come back once the wine is aged? No. These people... They're depending on me. I made them a promise. No, no, no, no, Mark. No, we cannot afford to sit around and wait an entire year while your wine ages. Why not? Yeah, easy to forget in all the fun and grape-stomping, but we have a life back home. No, not a life. Jobs. Yes, I have a job. Yeah, not a life. You said yourself. We were distant. All right, but a vacation in Italy doesn't fix that. It's a Band-Aid. So, let's... let's tear the Band-Aid off. I mean, we've been working our butts off. It's not a vacation. It's a... It's a new life. Good luck with your barrels. See! Barrels. Enzo is still good for something. Enzo, I'm proud of ya. What the...? - Hey! - John! - Don't I know you? - What are you doing here? Well, I was in Rome. Thought I'd pay you a visit. A nice, leisurely five-hour drive. What, are you keeping an eye on me? Uh, well, you know, I heard through the grapevine you were here. - See how I did that? You get it? - Mm-hmm. So you came back to your motherland, huh? - Yeah. - How's the wine business? Uh, you know, having fun losing my shirt. That's an interesting business model. You want the latest Santius update? So... after you left, so did half the R&D department. You're gonna walk out like that? You can't walk out on your contracts. Anybody with any talent went to a different company. The stock prices. The stock prices went down like a 747. So, long story short: Cavendish is out. I... I have zero interest in coming back. Okay. All right. But, just know that if you did, any company would be glad to have you. You can pretty much name your own price. Yeah, well, I... I have a job. I'm happy. Okay. All right, just hear me out, okay? I've got the perfect opportunity for you. It's a hotel chain. Not too many locations. Just twelve worldwide. Here's the big thing... They're restructuring. One hundred percent green policy. - Progressive. - Mm-hmm. I thought that might interest you. I know how hard you pushed for that with Santius. But, you know, if you're not interested. Ooh... Restructured how? - It's good to see you again. - Same here, John. Best to your family. Thanks. You'll let me know? Yeah, I'll text you a time and place. All right. Lawyer! What's up? It's time. - What? - It's time. Ah! Marco. The process is very simple. There's where the wine ferments. Understand? The wine ferments for eight days. There is a tube that will bring it here. This tube goes into the bunghole. Understand? Then, when it's full you take it out and place it in the other opening. Until you've done all the barrels. So we just have to spear all these bungholes. Yeah you gotta make sure you slide in the hole. Can you do that? What is it? What is it? Oh, honey, - I'm... I'm so sad you're leaving. - Mm. But I'm so happy you came. - You got a ride to the airport? - Yeah, uh, Gio keeps offering to drive me, so... You know, you could miss that flight. - If you wanted. - Okay... Hey, remember the DOGC is still coming - to get that sample at 11:00. - Oh, shit. Marcello! Meeting now! Marcello, something important came up. An opportunity. Uh, the timing is terrible. The DOGC guy is coming today. Patience, lawyer. Patience. No, no, it's gotta be now. I have a meeting with a hotel chain in Rome. - For work? - We'll see. Lawyer, the wine hasn't aged yet. We will have nothing to show them. No, no, you told me that you make wine every year. Three, four cases, yes? Or... more. Okay, so same process my grandfather taught you. Same vine, same soil, same French oak barrels. Si. Si. I give to him the oak barrel and then he give to me my beautiful house. Great. Now the secret is out. Enzo got me a few barrels, I let him squat. Don't worry, that's... but the wine! The wine! My wine is the same wine. We can give it to the jury to be certified. Si. Si. What time does your flight leave? Uh, call me as soon as they render their decision. Yeah, we're going now. Good luck. Now you're talkin'. - Ciao. - Ciao. Thank you for the opportunity. My grandfather's wine. Just taste the damn stuff, will ya? Are you ready to go to the airport? It was a pleasure to meet you. Thank you. Thank you. Is that the certification? This is it. Oh, what a day! The wine has been certified and your father's coming back home to work. - What do you mean? - Yes, he called. He's coming back tomorrow morning because everything worked out with the hotel chain. I mean, this whole Italian adventure has somehow fixed everything! What a magnificent day, Mrs. Gentile. Si, si. Hi. You look sad. Um... I know I shouldn't be upset. I've been trying to leave ever since I got here, but I finally get why this place is so special to him. Acerenza is special. I feel so... connected to it. Like, I... I finally get exactly where I came from. And it might be the sweet Italian air clouding my judgment, but ever since we got this, it's like I have this rush of ideas, you know? Like, um, like a picture of a life that... That washes over you in a split second. You have no idea what I'm talking about, right? Sorry. Now that it's, uh, coming to an end, I feel sad. Sad. End? My father is leaving. Uh, he's taking the job with the hotels. Uh, mi papa. - Si, Marco. - Marco... is leaving. Your father is leaving? Mm-hmm. Oh, I'll get the... the thing. One sec. Marco Gentile is leaving. He got a new job. So, let's have a drink, huh? Si. Vino Salute. Cheers! Yes! Cheers! Exactly. Put your feet down. Mm. There's nothing left to do, huh? What? I heard you're closing the vineyard. First it gave us hope. But now you want to ruin us and our families. Uh... They're mad at me. Yes, they are. They think you're closing down the business. How are you feeling? Okay. Who's our PR person? I don't know, why? What do you mean? Everybody thinks we're shutting down! What? I didn't say anything. But maybe... maybe Laura? - Laura! - Wha... She's still here? Yes, I think she's out back. Laura! - Hey! - Hey! - Where have you been? - Um... I was up late paying bills and then we... We went out. - What is... - Oh, my God. What are you doing? Make sure her father doesn't find out. What did you tell these people? I didn't tell them anything. We gotta get you Rosetta Stone. Okay, so I went to Rome last night for a business meeting, that's true. A small boutique hotel chain. They were interested in me to run their business. I brought Marcello's wine. They drank it. They loved it and, uh... starting next year, we are going to be the premier wine maker for the entire chain of the hotels. So, everybody, we still have a job. We're still in business! Marco, Marco. They don't understand a word. I'm going to translate what he said. You didn't understand anything he was saying, right? The vineyard is staying open! I told you it was going to get done. We're gonna need someone who is compassionate, knows wine, and doesn't take any bullshit. Have any ideas? Well, I might have some salary requirements. Talk to the boss. We should sell our house. Don't I get a say in this? Well, I've been thinking. You know, it could keep us afloat for another year. When we bottle our wine, we're gonna need a label. So what do you think of that? Oh. It's beautiful. May people drink this wine, and continue to smile long after we're gone. Salute. Salute. Salute! Salute! Cheers. - Mmm! - Salute! Oh! Mwah!
