Kaspar! Please! Don't take her away, she is my child! It's dangerous, stay away. Nina! Damn you Kaspar, damn you all. She'll be with her own kind. Home Ali, home. Master White, Master White - it's Mem, Master White. Mem, she is burning everything. Just let her be. Look further ahead. Just push it. Keep going. Master White, let's push on. This path is impossible Aunty Mem, Aunty Mem. What is it? Limah, the baby is coming. You go ahead, I'll be there soon. A little more. There, it's coming. Push. It is an English ship. Stay well hidden, wait until I come back. I have the newspaper for you There’s a new treaty Means we will have our Gideon jet flying over this territory within a month Finally we will get something done about those damn pirates Getting worked every month Those pirates are none of my business I am just-- a lone Dutchman On this god forsaken land Nina.. What a wonderful surprise You look…..you’ve grown up Hello Father Welcome my dear I trust your journey was safe Everything alright? I need to rest Mrs. Fink never wrote to say Nina was coming home Rather odd Circumstances ol’ boy—never easy for a half cast girl in Singapura No no—she loves it there around her own people—what exactly happen? Well it’s a young chap from the bank. Mrs. Fink adored him, thought she was courting her Emmer, When she found out he was courting Nina- She expelled poor Nina with orders to never return. Damn that old hag—Jealous of my Nina’s beauty She was never happy there you know—those two Fink girls always treated her with contempt—Well she is not white you know. She is a beautiful girl Well she is a good girl—but she keeps her thoughts locked out—even from my wife. At least she is home Mhmm well, best get on our way. And don’t you worry about the passage money, I know you are a bit short. Want my advice? Just leave her alone —Oh did you hear about ol Linguard? —He is dead—In the castle —Sorry Kaspar – Looks like he won’t be finding that mountain of gold he was always talking about. My child. It is me Mother. Nina, my child. Sambir was not the same without you. Since I'm not pure white and I'm a woman - Oh Mother, I did nothing wrong. I know, I do know. When I was very young, Lingard sent me to the white school too. Four years I lived in their world with their rules, their religion, their men. They wanted me to eat pork! Me too. I am not an infidel, I didn't even touch it. Did they make you wear those layers of clothes? And the days here are so hot! Dresses of course. And Petticoats and under garments. Leather shoes, the worst! They just crush your toes! Cakes, cakes. Can we have some? Go ask your mothers. Water spinach is her favourite dish, could Nina get it in Singapura? Singapura is not the white men's country. Just where do you think Nina's from? She is a child of Malaya. That white blood in her? There is no white blood in her. They sent her to Singapura, to attend their Christian school. But a river fish, however you cook it, will always taste like a river fish. Will you eat upstairs today? Your Master White eats upstairs with my child. I will eat right here. I will never want to eat with him. No thank you. Ali will be pleased, not to cook Master White's meals anymore. He was scared I would poison him. He knows I won't poison Nina. How could he think I would poison anyone. Peace be upon you, Your Highness. And upon you. Your Highness is here to see Master White? To do some buying. Let me introduce my nephew, just back from doing the Haji. Haji Sayed Rashid. And this is Orang Kaya Tinggi, His Highness' most trusted man. You look well. With Allah's blessing, Your Highness. Welcome Your Highness. Thank you. So, Your Highness, how can I help you? Do you have guns for sale? We need two - a present for the head man, a token of friendship with the aboriginals. That’s a very worthy present.—and I, have very worthy guns. —And for you, Tuanku, I will sell at a very worthy price. And gunpowder? We need more this time. Of course. Master, we need more resin. Allie will get some for you.—Allie!—I need those ready for the river as soon as possible. Things seem better for him. Since the daughter returned, business improved. People are paying their old debts. She brings him good luck Your Highness. Did you notice the boats he's building? Is he still searching for Lingard's gold mountain? I belong to Mahmat. Belong? You mean his wife. No I'm not. But perhaps one day. I live with his wives. I was brought here, from my home far across the seas. His wives make the cakes, and I sell them. How many wives does he have? Four. So he must divorce one to marry you. But which one? And you, Miss Nina? Me? Marry? Nobody wants me, I still don't belong to anyone. I'll probably end up an old maid, taking care of two old rotting houses. You're starting all over again - aren't you? What now? I told you already Kaspar, tell His Highness. He is there now - right now. Ask for his help. But not you, you want to use these aboriginals. They can't help you. He is an important king, we share the same ancestors. He'll help you find the gold. What gold? What gold are you talking about? Go, go away. I am your wife Kaspar. Your wife in the eyes of your religion, your law. Don't you forget that! Damn you woman. I am not your slave Kaspar. Lingard was my father - not yours. I have a right to this house and that gold, to everything you have. Look, look at me. I have nothing, not even jewelry. I want my share Kaspar. You have no idea how much I have missed you Nina. —We were so close when you were little. —Remember how we used to get in the sand pan and explore the waterways together. Yes. I remember. —Why did you send me away father? It was your grandfathers wish. Old Linguard? Yes—He wanted you to have a Christian education and become a fine lady. But your my father, you could have— A young girl can not get a proper education in this place Nina. It was best for your future, But it broke my heart to see you go. Yes. So you wrote, in the beginning, and then your letters stopped coming. Why didn’t you bring me home? At least for a visit Believe me, I wanted nothing more, but things here started detreating. —Nina, your mother went mad, She destroyed this place, everything to her heart, and business well, it’s been disappointing, I didn't want you to see your home like this, All that is behind us now—Allie!, Everything will be better now that you are here, my dear Nina Excuse me. He thinks I'm a fool. I know about his grand plan. Making boats for his crazy expeditions. He can't hide it from me. All night he studies old Lingard's maps and notes, trying to find the moutain of gold. Were you forced to marry him? It was Lingard who chose Almayer, I didn't want to marry. Almayer never wanted me. It was the trading business and wealth, that Lingard promised him if he married me. Now that old Lingard is dead, Almayer thinks he can find the gold, and be the king of the seas. But what does he know of the jungle and people? This country will never tell its secrets to a traitor. If he wants to find the mountain, he must listen to me. I was born and bred here. I am a Malay! And you are Malay Nina. Your Highness. There are too many white man's ships. They must pay for the use of our waters. I don't want any trouble here, I want peace for all people. Do you understand? I understand Your Highness is wise. But I need much more gunpowder. I don't have any gunpowder. My father, The King of Sagu island, will appreciate the help you give his son. I have sailed a long way to do business. Many people come here, from Chinese to Arabs. Even a white man lives here. Then I am correct to come here for gunpowder. The English made it illegal to sell gunpowder. I will tell no one, Your Highness. I will pay generously, considering how difficult it is to obtain. How much do you want? As much as I can get. Are you willing to pay extra? As my father used to say, when others give, don't just take, but also reach out. If there is any, it will come from the white man across the river. The Arabs? They will talk. I bow to your superior wisdom. Go and see the white man. He can get powder from Singapura or Batavia. He is weak although he thinks he is strong. He can be talked into selling gunpowder. This a difficult time, but since the Raja sent you, I believe I can safely help you with the powder. Excellent. And perhaps we can do other business together, that would bring handsome awards to both of us. I assume you are an experienced ship captain. I have sailed a long way, and been to many different places. And then you are familiar with the rivers of the Inam jungle I have crossed the thickest jungles. My daughter, please understand that western women have different customs. Yes, of course. Pardon me for disturbing your family. I shall return another time to finish our business. What is this stupidity? Are you going crazy like her? Who is that man? What concern of that is yours or anybody else’s? You want him to take you to the gold, don't you? He nuks? Intriguing. What do you think about him father? He’s decent, formally, Of course with all those jewels he is no doubt a pirate. Anyone with eyes can see, that beautiful young man is a prince. Nonsense. With all those jewels? Now Lingard - he was a pirate. You say that about the man who saved your life! Who adopted you! It wasn't adoption - I was kidnapped. He was a pirate. Enough women!—Linguard was a trader, a business man, just as I am. Business? Your business is drinking, the Devil's water! On behalf of the people of Sambir, we express appreciation and pledge faithfulness to the government of Great Britain. We treasure our allies. And the pirates? Do not be concerned, you have our co-operation. The co-operation of all of us. Including our Dutch friend Master Almayer. That's true isn't it, Master Almayer? Those pirates wouldn't dare to come here. I’ve heard Mr.Almer, you are bit of an adventurer, you know the local terrain and customs. I have been all over this part of the world. Then tell me, what is this gold I have heard mentioned. It’s not only gold, but diamonds as well, Lying right on the ground of a mountain they call ganuga mass which translates to “Gold Mountain”. The only problem is that no such mountain exists HAHA! It is the stuff of local legend, mythology. Whose house is that? My house, my dream house. All mine Unfinished I see I’m building it myself, The locals will not help, or at least until I plundered into the mountain of treasure and pay for the matter haha. You are aware of this treaty that we signed with the Dutch; It had to be done really, We need to work together to control this invasion of pirates flooding out of the war in Arche. I am Your faithful subject, what about if— Look over there! Ahh! They continue to celebrate our arrival. That’s a good sign, very good sign for these aboriginals you know? There that’s not around Ashley, that’s the Arrows. What do you think about Almayer? Hmm, He is in his own world. Ha wow Wait, What was it they called it? Almayer's funny. Master Almayer is an important man in Sambir. We are grateful to Allah, that we live together in peace. And as the head of the Arabs here, I will offer help with anything you need. On this day of celebration, we come with the best of intentions. Nina, has grown into a beautiful girl. She should have luxuries. Rashid already has several local Malay girls, but now he seeks a wife he truly cares for. Nina, will be mistress of the splendors of his house. The other women, will be merely slaves. This is three thousand ringgit, as a token of our sincerity, for your daughter, Master Almayer. Nina….. is young, and she is more dear to me than anything in this world, But she is not well schooled in religion. Not well enough for the religious Hajeem Rasheed, He would not be happy, He would want a poise Wife. The white man thinks he is too good for us. There are many other girls. He wants a white man to marry his daughter. No white man wants to live here. They come only to make their fortune. He has no choice but to stay here. One day he will regret not respecting me. Its sweet of you to protect me father. I could never allow you to become a slave of an arrow head and their barbaric customs. —Be careful Nina when you go out paddling around, who knows what they will do now. Nina? You hear me? They wouldn’t dare. When we are rich Nina, I will take you to the Netherlands, You shall have a cultured, wealthy European husband. In their eyes father I am not white, they will not want me there. Of course they will want you. Mother said the only reason why you married her was because Linguard wanted you too. That’s not true. He gave you a business and a house. That Witch is filling your head with non-sense. —I must take you back home to the Netherlands as soon as possible. Return? You've never even been to the Netherlands. Have you? You were born in Singapura. It is my homeland women, birthplace of my parents, my grandparents. If that's how you feel, go. Go wherever you want. But don't ever involve my child. As soon as I return from my exhibition, Nina and I will leave this mosquito infested, disease ridden place forever. Over my dead body. Cake girl, come here. Come here cake girl. Don't be shy. Get rid of the flag, remove all the insignia. Make sure nothing of the English can be seen. All of you, hurry up! Start down there. Yes sir Does this look like a pirate ship? We are honest merchants. It is true Sir. These are trading goods from Makassar. Rattan, food, cloth. You neglected to mention the barrels of gun powder. This is not mine. It belongs to the Raja. If you take this, you will have to answer to him. He has a license for this powder. Not anymore Four of you continue to search Yes sir. Someone informed the English. Your Highness, we want peaceful business dealings. But if people work against us, it will be difficult. We help each other Your Highness, I have paid a deposit, and now I've lost everything. Rasheed, That's enough. He is young, Your Highness. We are business men, we make a profit, we lose; all as Allah wills. Don't worry about the deposit. I will take the responsibility. It is the white man who betrays us, he is one of them. It is not good to spy. I'm not spying on anyone. You speak Malay? I was at your house, I am Dain Maroola. I know who you are. You came to trade with my father. Yes, with Master Almayer. Your name, Miss? White skin... White face... But not the eyes of a white woman. Where have you been Nina? And who is this? My apologies, I am Dain Maroola, from the Island of Sagu. I was accompanying Nina back home, one has to be cautious. A humble gift for the beautiful lady of the house. People here call me Mem. And you met my daughter? Yes, you must be proud of her. In all my travels I have never seen such beauty. Master Dain, we are grateful. Our hands are too small, to contain your great generosity. Compared with your perfection, my gift is of no consequence. Excuse me, I must see Master Almayer. Thick jungle. Do you know that side of the Island? No, not yet. Rapids and fierce currents everywhere. But with strong boats, I can go there. I hear that the local aboriginals are particularly vicious. True. But we need their help. And they will want to help me, as I trade goods and other items they want. So I am in a position to help you. Ahh, Now I will have to tell the Raja everything. Let it be. Dain please, I don’t want the Raja to know anything about this. He heard nothing. Did you, old man? With no eyes, an old crocodile will sun himself all day. Is that not so? Yes, Your Highness. And when you have no ears, an elephant farting is nice to hear. Is that not so? Yes, true Your Highness. And if you have no tongue and need to speak, the infidel will scream in hell or remain silent. Isn't it true? Yes, it's true. Allah has made the sun shine, the birds sing, and the ears that hear sweet whispers of beautiful virgins in the night. Shall we? I am almost at peace tonight my darling. This will be the last time that I will be gone. Cold Nina, and snow, I will have to wrap you in furs to keep you warm darling. Goodnight. Goodnight. Girl, 485, what cakes are you selling today? I have coconut cakes... Who is that? Cakes, Your Highness. Would you like one? Don't leave! Pretty ladies shouldn't be in a hurry. Especially ones with coconut cakes. Father calls Mother a witch, Mother calls him the devil. So what does that make me? -------------------------------------- 496 You are a bestowal from Allah, a gift for men. I wish for a place where no one is angry. No hatred, no accusations, just happiness. On my island, the paddy fields are yellow... The water is crystal clear, and the fish swims to your palm. It won't be much longer Master. You have two days. Two days, no more. Yes Master White, it will be done. I'd like to take you to my island. I have to go away for a while Nina. Where? Why? I will come back for you. In the morning, meet me at our special place. Load this box of gunpowder. That was the last box, Master White. Be careful, keep it dry. Everything is ready. Cover the boxes well. Of course he will give me more... Who has ever given me anything? Am I a slave? No, I am the mother of a Queen. So you saw? That is a lot of money. It's mine! For you. He is a son of a King. My daughter will be his Queen. Is that what my return means to you? To sell me? Like selling a possession? You are my daughter, how could I sell you? There is no such thing. This is our custom, our old tradition. A dowry. Nina, he wants you as his wife. This is just the beginning. He will give more before he takes you to his island. His father is a King. You hear me? A King. And you are worth much more. The great grandaughter of Kings. There should be more. More, and more. Dain, wake up. Someone saw us. I think that's Taminah. She sells cakes at my brig every morning. Quick. Did you see who that was? Did you recognise them? Wasn't it Dain? With Nina, the white man's daughter? Nina, return on your own. How long will you be gone? Would I willingly stay in the dark? I am a blind man without you, Nina. I won't be gone long. In love with Dain! Mahmat's slave, Taminah. Her face was red. She was furious they were in the same boat. Where is he now? Gone. Back to his island. Kaspar, dinner. Dain. At last. I’ve been waiting for you every day and every night. I nearly given you up Nothing can stop me from coming back here, not even death. What do you mean? What is it? What’s wrong? Nothing. Tomorrow I will see you and we will talk. But now I must go to the King. Dain, You are not going to abandoned me now, are you? Now that everything is ready There are things I must do yet, for your own good and mine. Till tomorrow. Paddle. Did you hear a boat not long ago? No There was a boat, and in it was Dian. He just went to see the Raja Rashid. Did you speak to him, father? Yes I did, My dear Nina. I’m confidante now you and I shall soon be on his ship bound to the Atlantics. And this life of misery will fade into dim and distance memory like a bad dream. It’s not easy trust him, Malay. I must admit Dain is a perfect gentleman, a perfect gentleman. Did you ask him to come here? Of course, He’ll be here tomorrow and then we start our expedition the day after that. We mustn’t lose any time. Are you glad? I am, I am glad. Naturally you can’t image what is before you. I haven’t been to Europe either, but I’ve heard my mother talk about it so many times. I can picture every detail in my mind. We shall live a glorious life. Eh, another thunder storm. Well, no thunder will keep me awake tonight. What is joy to a poor man, except the generosity of a great trader? We heard boats were stopped in the estuary. His Highness was worried, even unable to sleep. Be quiet, idiot! So speak Dain. I have heard many rumours. Rashid came with bad news, about you and your brig. My brig is in the hands of the English, that is true Your Highness. Believe me, the English have friends in Sambir. How else would they know we were here? It's true, we did escape Orang Kaya Tinggi. And the English will pursue us here. The English will seek their faithful friends, His Highness and his slave, Orang Kaya Tinggi. And they will rejoice. Did you hear me, ruler of Sambir? Are we not the sons of great kings, who should be protected? We are here to seek refuge, we need to know your decision. You came here for the white man's daughter. Your refuge is as the son of the Supreme King. Am I to protect all his Princes? When love enters the heart, a man is like a child. You came here with sweet promises of trade, I looked the other way, while you persuaded the white man. What do you want now? It would be easier for me to have you killed. Much easier. Much better. Many of my men are dead. I warn you, the English are dangerous. They have never based themselves here. And I don't want them in my Kingdom. I am the Ruler here! They will come here. Give me your men. I will lead them and we will defeat the English. That is dangerous, the English are too strong. Deception will be more effective. Then hide me. You can hide, but not here. Where? Near Mahmat's house. Much further down the river, where the English cannot find him. They are after the white man. They hate another white man who betrays. Master White will be caught, and taken away. Once the English leave with Almayer, His Highness Dain will find the treasure for you. One person less to share with. Your Highness and, Dain alone. Will you go to Mahmat's house, until the danger is over? You have to leave now, before it is bright. The English won't reach here till tomorrow night. I must inform Almayer of our arrangement. No Your Highness, no. I will inform him myself, before sunrise. The river looks angry, logs are drifting everywhere. The water is rising. Will you still go? Anjang! I am here Your Highness! If the English come here, and take Almayer to Singapura, they will interrogate him. What do you think he will say? I don't know Your Highness. You are a fool! He will tell them where the treasure is. Apologising, begging for mercy. Almayer must die to keep our secret safe. He must die soon Orang Kaya Tinggi. You must do it. Tomorrow? Yes. Before the English reach here. Orang Kaya Tinggi... Your Highness? I cannot sleep. Bring me the music box. Yes Your Highness. Husband Mahmat, won't you eat first? I've eaten. I want to check the raft house, see if the rain swept it away last night. Be it Allah's will...a body. There's a body in the river! Quick, call for help. Someone's drowned! Hurry! Master White, Master White! Master White, they have found a body. His sarong was caught in broken branches, his head under water. When I saw it, I pushed it to drift away. Why must we bury this stranger in our village? We've had enough of ghosts, frightening our women and children. But I realised the body will end up at sea, so Master and Kaya Tinggi might be angry, so I dragged the body ashore. Allah! Why wail like that? I touched the body from who knows where. I have been defiled. If not defiled, I may be cursed. Really. Look at the anklets. No corpse wears anklets and appears at midnight. This must be the work of witchcraft. However, I still want these anklets. For protection against ghosts, so I am not afraid. Allah is great. Do you know who this is? It is fate! Look! Look down by your feet white man! I recognise the ring on that finger. Everyone leave. This is men's work. Leave! I claim this body in the name of His Highness. No one remain here except Almayer's people. Go away, leave! Alee, roll him over. I don’t understand? What is this about a ring? The body has been crushed by logs. The head must have been caught between. The face is destroyed. The flesh and bones, lips and eyes are still there, but who can recognise who it is? Quiet Mahmat, enough! Take your eyes off the anklets! You pig. Master Almayer, have you seen Dain this morning? No, I am still waiting for him. Wasn’t he with the Raja? He left last night during the storm. The night was dark. He came to see you, by torchlight. Even with the river so full, and logs - he insisted. And now, here he lies. How do you know it is him? Nobody can tell. Look at this ring, Nobody can tell. Dain never removed this ring. I will have to tear the flesh to remove it. Disaster, Nina. He is dead. I may as well bury all my burdens. I awoke this morning thing there so much to be done, because tomorrow was the day. The day of the expedition, but now… Dain is dead. What are you half alive? Dain is dead. Do you understand?! Died. And you don’t care. I struggle and suffer, well you sat around like some unfeeling princess. You have no heart. You have no mind. Because if you did, you’d understand everything I did, everything I did was for you and your happiness! Say something Nina! Don’t you have an ounce of sympathy for your father? I love you more than life itself, Nina. Lay it there. Just there, right. He is an infidel, a dog - a friend of the white man. He drank the white man's devil water. I saw it myself. Have I done well, Miss White? Yes, good. The ring, just keep it. Boats! Boats! English are coming! They are nearly here! Rashid. Did you hear about Dain's death? The whole village is talking about it. Four days ago the news was he was killed by the English - on his brig. Who would you believe? Whatever happened, he is gone. It was fate. He no longer poses a danger to people. Allah be praised. Cake girl. Cake girl! Come here! The English have arrived. Now we will have opportunities. We shall see. White men are quick to anger, and slow to appreciate. Here. Over here. There will be many white men in Almayer's house. You sell your cakes there. Everything you see and hear, you report to me. You understand me? We have rather unpleasant business with you. What? Can’t be anything too serious, surely? Well, if you think the attempt of blowing up forty men isn’t too serious. You would find yourself in the minority. Blow up what? I’ve heard nothing about this. Who did it? A man who you had some dealings, he passed through here under the name Dain Maroola. You sold him the gun powder we had and the ship we captured. Ship? I know nothing about this. A local Arab trader recently sent word of your leadings to Batavia and Singapore. And you trust the word of an Arab, over gentleman’s? We want Dain Maroola! We know he is hiding here in Sandia, and we are pretty sure you do too. Where is Dain! If you catch this Dain Maroola, what would you do to him? That’s a question, not an answer. What would you do to me? We present don’t have orders about your person, but we expect your assistance in capturing this Malay. Exactly, you can’t do anything without me. But as I know this Dain Maroola well, I will help you find him. Steady gentlemen, steady in my own time, and in my own way. First, we dine, then you can have him. This is preposterous Almayer! This man is a criminal! He’ll escape while we dine. I give you my word of honor. He is not going anywhere. Now let us dine! Gentlemen, allow me to introduce my daughter Nina. These gentlemen, officers from the boat outside have done me the honor of accepting my hospitality. Please join us. Allow me to offer this to your table. Wine...very kind. Explain again Kaya Tinggi, I was only half awake. The night Dain left here Your Highness, he went to get the white man's daughter. Dain nearly drowned in the rising waters. He made it ashore and Nina saved him. Forgive me, you knew I would come back for you. I never doubted you Dain. We have to help Anjang. Anjang... he is dead. They brought the crazy woman, and told her everything. Take off the ring. Now swap your clothes with his. You must go to the place beyond Mahmat's house. The English won't find either of you. Just leave me here. How can I believe you? Sounds like a myth spilling from a woman's mouth. Everybody has been deceived. The white man was grieving, and fled into his house. I didn't believe it and questioned the woman. Fearing my anger - and you might Your Highness; she confessed everything. Listen here, Orang Kaya, I am not well and shall rest. You go over and deal with the white man. Yes, Your Highness, I will go at once. Dain? Arrange as best you can, my heart is troubled. Your Highness. If we find the treasure, he should have no part of it. I will take him away by canoe, using a different route. His father will be pleased with your help, and the alliance with him will give you more power. Then Almayer will deliver the dead body, to the English- who they think is Dain. Then the foolish white men will say, "Well done." "Let there be peace"; then the trouble will be lifted from your heart. That's right Orang Kaya, that's true. All this will be accomplished by me, your humble slave. I am sure you will reward me, Your Highness is generous. We shall see. Listen, he is drunk. He must sleep soundly tonight, we don't want him to hear anything. Sometimes the devil water will keep him awake. Pacing up and down, cursing at everything. But he will be drunk - confused and weak. He can kill. Trust me. I'm already old, and I'm not afraid of death. I want to live! I need your King's protection, he will remember when we were young. Disloyal, what of our glorious empire has ever done to make me loyal? You have no grip of this country! I had to take care of myself and when I ask for protection, what do I get... threats and contempt. The Arabs throw slander in my face, I, a white man. I believe it’s time for you to deliver the prisoner. I take it you have Dain Maroola stored away somewhere. I wanted to say a little gold for a little powder what’ that? I know, I know No, you don’t know. No! No! No! None of you know, not one of you knows. There is gold, heaps of gold. And I am the man, the man who knows. Well, I warn you, but he won’t speak. You’re a fine fellow. That’s it! Gather the men now! Gather the men now! In the compound! I want some scene out of the old fool. Hey! Almayer! Almayer! Wake up man! You are very young, plenty of time for a full and rich life. You must keep your promise! What is this promise you speak of? How dare you come to my house and insult …. Well he promise to delivery us a man. A man who in a time of peace took the lives of innocent men. I am sure you heard of Dain Moorla. We know he escaped up this river, perhaps you could... And he killed white men? I regret to say they were white, yes. Two white men lost their lives to that scoundrel’s actions. Only two? Yes... why? Well, I’ll get him for you myself. You’ll leave then?! Taking your white faces, and gentle voices, your sweet words for any pretty face I hope to live here without seeing another white face. But this You’re a good girl Nina. You are drunk! But not too drunk to know what you are doing. Enough fooling around! I wouldn’t want to arrest you in your own house Arrest! Arrest! I’ve be trying to get out of this inferno place for 20 years. 20 years, you hear me man! I can’t, I can’t. And I never and I never will. NEVER! Unhand me! Let me go! Come follow me every one please. I have something I want to show you. Here, look at your dan-ge-rous man. Obverse, cold... like the hunt rat. I’m sure you disappointed that you cannot hang him. Gentlemen, Dain Maroola I kept my word, this corps was my last hope I have nothing left now. You think there is one dead man here hm? No, let me assure you I’m much more dead. Why don’t you hang me! ---------------------------- 946 If you are not telling the truth, I will tie you to a tree myself. This is his ring. So it must be Dain. I kept it, so it wouldn't fall into the wrong hands. I knew it was Dain all along. He might fool other people, but not me. I am the one who found him. If not for me, you wouldn't have him at all. But what have I got for all this? Nothing. Nothing at all. You will be a great queen. But remember, the strengths and the weaknesses of men. Tremble before his anger, show him your fear during the day. Laugh in your heart, because at sunset he is your slave. Slave? He is his own master in all he does. Mother, you don't know him. Nina... What do you know of men's anger or love? Have you seen a man sleep in fear? Have you seen a hand, ready to stab a beating heart with a dagger? Have you? You are becoming more like a white woman. If I am a white woman, what would I be doing here, ready to leave? Mother, I want to see Father once more. No! No! You are my daughter now. I will not let you go to that house again. I forbid you! If you move another step, I will cry out. There are angry white men after the man you love. My voice will wake them, and lead them to where Dain is waiting for you. Leave now, before the moon rises. When will we see each other again? Never. Why should you return just to see my grave? You'll live far away, in happiness. When I hear of white men driven from the islands, then I'll know you are alive. Remember what I say. I will always remember. Listen to me, Nina. In the future, there will be other women. There will be other women. Hide your anger. Don't show it on your face. No Mother, not him. Receive him with joy and be smart. Because in sadness or doubt, he will turn to others. There will be many other women. But if there is only one other woman, show that she-devil no mercy! Master White. Wake up Master White. Get up before it's too late. They have gone. Nina, Master White. Dain, Master White, Dain! Your house is empty, the women have all left. She has left. I was afraid to wake you Master. The spirit of a sleeping man wanders. If I had woken you suddenly, the spirit would leave your body and never return. Then you would never wake up. You were talking in your sleep. What the hell are you talking about woman? Tell me Dain, Master White! I am the one who loves Dain! But Nina came and stole him away from me. They were always together behind your back, Mem knew all about it. Now he pretends to be dead. But he is hiding. Mem planned all of this. Nina has gone to join Dain. You must stop them! Nina is gone… Liar! Who sent you woman?! Nina! They are waiting in the clearing at Mahmat's. I can’t believe this! Nina! Wake up everyone! Dain, Nina - hiding at Mahmat's. Orang Kaya Tinggi should be here by now. We have a long journey ahead of us. What is that? Stay behind me Nina. Father. Let us talk! It is too easy to seek death. We choose life now, and we don't want Nina hurt. Nina want is this madness! Come to your father! Come to your father! Talk to him. Who wouldn't grieve at losing you. Nina do you know what is waiting for you if you follow this rouge? You’ll be a play thing, a scorn slave, judged, a servant, just a fight of fancy for the man Is that true Dain? Before Allah in heaven and on earth, I am willing to give you my life. I breathe with your breath, I see with your eyes. I think with your heart, and give you my heart forever. I see through your eyes, I breathe your breath, I think through your heart. You’re a thief! That is not true Sir! I professed my love like a man. She heard my heart cry out and answered it. What have I done Nina? What have I done? To make you give yourself to this savage? He is a savage! There is a barrier between you. I can see it in your eyes Nina. There’s madness. No, I know you want me to dream your dreams and see your visions, visions of life among white people. I tried to listen to my own voice, father, and then Dain came. You call him a savage. Then what did you call my mother, your wife! Come here! No! Let me go! No! You listen to me! In time our voices; his and mine will speak together in tenderness. And now we go to a place where no one can follow, at least of all you. I am Malay now Father. This is my life. My life is with him. My love for you has never changed, but I cannot leave him. I cannot live without him! Enough! Ali is waiting in the creek. If you don’t come with me now, I’ll tell me to inform the English. You can’t escape Nina. I set your canoe a drift. Now let’s go! -No! I will not go! -Now come with me! Holding hands, I want you alive. Listen to me Almayer! It is too easy for me to stab you with my dagger. You should leave. I give you my life, Nina's life, and your life. Orang Kaya Tinggi? Yes, I'm here. Hurry to my canoe, run. We must leave immediately, the girl has talked. The girl? The she-dog Taminah. Mahmat's slave. She yelled at Sayed Abdullah's gate, till the whole of Sambir woke up. The English are here. Taminah has shown them the way. Go now if you want to live. Will you go and leave my daughter? I will never part from Nina. Master White, The canoe is hidden at the creek, in the bushes. They say the white men are here. Wait for me, Ali. Keep the canoe hidden. I will never forgive you, Nina, never. The memory of night will burn in my heart forever. I have no daughter. You Dain Maroola, whatever your name is thief! I will take you and that woman to the mouth of the river. Orang Kaya promised a boat will meet us. Talk to her. Her tears are worse than the wrath of Allah. All I ever wanted for you was happiness. What happiness, if there is no life? Life must mean love. When that thief came, I also saw the blue skies and the sunshine, then a thunder bolt struck, and now my world is dark. Tomorrow, I shall forget you Nina. You only say that because you love me. You love me! I know you do! We should go now. Those were your Father's last words, for you Nina. Goodbye. Father. Take her away. Master White - he is upstairs. He speaks to himself, perhaps with the devil. I can’t forget.
