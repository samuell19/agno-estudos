A good friend once told me the human brain can stay functioning for up to 15 minutes after you're dead. Or was it 50 minutes? I forget. Well, I guess it's in these 15 or so minutes, I tell you this story. Instead of showing us what we want, you're here wasting everyone's time. Officer, I'm late for work. Work? What is even the time? 8 p.m. So now, when your mates, they go out, at that time, you leave for work? Truly, you are an internet fraudster. He's clean, we should let him go. Let him go? Have you checked everything? You don't check his laptop? Check his laptop, look in his browser past! Browser history. Officer, be careful with my laptop. The only thing I can get from there is that… This guy watches a lot of porn. Damn! You're sick in the head! Hope you know that. Officer, what's all this? This is an invasion of my privacy! Don't you know that? Continue, MC Grammar, I'm listening. Look here, just because we didn't find any evidence doesn't mean you are not a criminal. Okay, give us something for the weekend and be on your way After you have harassed me and wasted my time, when I told you I was late? Calm down. Just give us something small and be on your way. Stop that incoming car. - Who are you giving this to? - Officer take! What is this? Am I your child? Take from me! You're too tightfisted, leave this place! Hey, what's happening there? Who's that? Park properly. Officer, well done. Well done. Identify yourself, please. What seems to be the problem, officers? May we know you? What do you do? What do I do? What kind of question is that? Open the door. Look, officer, I'm going somewhere now and I'm running late. I said open this door! The sun is scorching today. Seems like the last person to enter hell forgot to shut the door. But look how cold your car is. Money is really good! So what's your name? My name is Brume. Brume. So, Brume, you are not a novice and I am not a novice. We both know how this works. So how's it gonna be? What sort of question is that? Brume, Brume, Brume, don't prolong this matter. Listen, there are two ways we can do this. The Ikoyi way or the Mushin way. How do you want it? Well, I'm going to Ikoyi, I'm on my way to Ikoyi already. The traffic at Sandfield is going to be bad. So let me just start heading there now. Okay, I guess you prefer the Mushin way. Okay. You want the mainland way then. Okay, open your laptop. - Open. - Okay, wait! I will open it! - Take it easy. - I'll open it. You better do what he tells you to do. What's the story, Felix? This guy is not a small fish, he's big time. He's a big fish! Your chickens have come home to roost! Boss, this guy is rich! Offshore and onshore accounts! - Oh, yeah? - I don't know. Yet I think ten million would be fair. - Ten million naira? - Yes. What job do people think you do? Or do they believe you're a music producer? We're your guests now. Treat us nice. At least give us drinks. I have water? Beer? No! We are on duty and can't drink beer. Do you have champagne? Oh, boy! Whoever says crime doesn't pay should be struck by thunder. Him and all his generation. All right. Can we just get down to it? Let me get my phone and make the transfer. Ten million is fair. Five million for you, five million for me. I'm okay with just five million. I think we should ask him for 15 million. 15 million naira? Of course! 15 million naira is good too, we split 7.5 each. Look at you! I thought you said you were okay with just five. Wow. Look at this place. Go easy on this stuff. It's not like beer. Okay. To a good partnership! A good partnership! Sure! Let's cut to the chase, your bill is 20. Twenty million naira! This is no joke. You hear me? You do the transfer now and we are out of your hair. Where am I supposed to get twenty million? Look, we know you have more. We can clear you out, but we are being generous. So how is it going to be? Look, I don't have that kind of money, please, I don't know what you talking about. Please just leave my things. Let's just... When we get to the jungle, you go explain everything. Take his laptop. What's the matter with you? - Stand up! - Officer, please, just… - Move! - Please, officer, wait! Move! What's all this playacting? Come on, let's go. What is happening? Officer. Officer. Are you okay? The champagne went straight into your head? He should've warned you. It packs a punch. Najite? Brume. You are late. Yeah, I'm sorry. Traffic at Sandfill. You're very lucky that I had this to keep me busy. What's that? Hyacinthe Kakou! Le Fou du Carrefour. French? Ivory. Playwright. It's a play. I see you're not into e-books. No. All e-books do is ruining the reading experience. I know what you mean. It's like seeing a movie online versus the cinemas. So, what is it about? Well… It's about an industrialized African city, overrun by waste. Everyone complains about it. But no one ever does anything about it. So, one day, a not-so-jolly citizen decides that enough is enough, and he's going to clean up all of the waste. They nickname him "The Madman." 'Cause he must be so crazy, right? Why think he can succeed where everyone else has failed. However, he successfully cleans up all of the waste. And everyone's happy. Then all those who profited from the waste, become broke and jobless and of course very upset. So they throw The Madman out of the city, and the waste starts to build up again. And then everyone starts to complain. So he said I was a nerd. Did he? Not in so many words. Edgy, booksmart. But he said you'd definitely be my type. And am I? Wow, straight to the point. Okay. Well, I don't see the point of wasting any time? He was pretty sure that we would get along. And he said you guys have known each other since you were like what? Five? Our parents were neighbors. So what else did Mr. Big Mouth say? Well… that you are divorced, and that you would be late, because you never wear a watch. But however, not to hold those two things against you because you're really a good guy. He said that? He is not serious. There you go. Come, let's get out of here. After all, we're your guests now. You are supposed to take care of us. Treat us nice. At least give us drinks. Your mates spend one million naira a night at the club. Even more than that. This guy claims he left his phone at home. Joker. Where's your house? - My name is Brume. - Brume. So, Brume, you are not a novice now. Boss, this guy is very rich! Offshore and onshore accounts! - Oh, yeah? - I don't know… Ten million is fair. We can do this the Ikoyi way or the Mushin way. How do you want it? Okay. To a good partnership! A good partnership! How long was I out for? Long enough. What? Where's the cage? Guy, forget about the cage now. I couldn't carry it all by myself, could I? Let's just get this thing over with. Hey. Wake up! Now listen to me. You see all this? The dreads, the rings, the gold chain, the complete starter pack. I even thought of throwing in a tattoo, just for the fun of it. But it turns out I didn't have to. Your chickens have come home to roost! Sir, please. Please, let's talk. You know us from somewhere? Just shut up. You're feeling like a champion, huh? You think you're Anthony Joshua? If you're that confident, why you no untie me? - Let's see then. - What are you doing? What are you doing? You are losing control! You know what they did. You know what they fucking did! Yes. I know. But you need to calm the fuck down. Sir, what did we do? Please. I want to use the toilet. Pee in your pants! Babe. What happened? Najite, one. Stupid, crazy bottle that won't open easily, zero. Come on, give the poor bottle a chance. Happy birthday, darling. - Babe, I thought we… - What? Sorry? Sue me. We also said no birthday gifts. No, come on! There you go. Babe. Now I feel bad. Don't feel bad, babe. It's really okay. Okay, open it. Okay. Wow! - Okay. This is beautiful. - I know. I thought it could help you with your little lateness problem that you have going on there. Okay. I do not have a lateness problem. You definitely have a lateness problem, babe. Okay. You'll be late for your own funeral. Tell me again, when was your expected delivery date? When was that? - March 28th. - March 28th. And when is your birthday? - April 28th. - April 28th. That's what I thought. Boom! I knew telling you that story was a bad idea. That is what happens when you try to show off for the Queen on your first date. You end up snitching on yourself. That was a beautiful gift. I know. And you are beautiful. Hopefully, we'll get some good news tomorrow. Tomorrow? What's happening tomorrow? You already forgotten that we have our appointment with Dammy tomorrow? - That's tomorrow? - Yep. That's tomorrow. Shit! From the tests, you are both completely healthy. You're fertile. There's no reason why you shouldn't conceive. It's baffling. Medically baffling. - Is this some kind of joke? - No. Look, when I took over from Dr. Idowu, I promised that I would pursue this until we get results. But this is not a result, Dammy. This is neither here nor there. Guys, I know you hate to hear this, but maybe you should start reconsidering adoption. What? Are you suggesting we give up? No. I can keep running tests, but Dr. Idowu did so many. I can run you through these tests. This guy! Brume! - Babe. - Come on. Guy. Look, Naj, - I... - It's okay, Dammy. It's fine. Okay, it's not your fault. Don't worry about him, he'll calm down. I'll call you later. He's lucky I didn't knock his teeth out. He was only making a suggestion. Which was the same suggestion Dr. Idowu made right before he jumped ship. He has helped many, many, many couples conceive. Are you sure he'd even give them babies from orphanages? He's your good friend. One of our best friends. That's why I didn't want us to use him in the first place. Well, I thought that he needed the work. He's been… doing quite badly lately. Guy, what the fuck? Why now? We can't upload the video with your face in full view. Fuck the evidence. What the hell does that mean? Look, let's just get them to confess as planned. And I said fuck the evidence. And I said let's just get them to confess. I don't need them to admit to anything. I don't need anything else from those bastards. Guy, you're not suggesting what I think you are. And? Wouldn't the world be a better place without them? Brume. Brume. Press the control key. Get a fucking grip. They took everything from me. They destroyed my life! If you don't see a reason why they need to suffer, then you shouldn't be here. You invited me here, remember? You asked for my help. You never said anything about offing those guys. That is what you're suggesting, isn't it? What happened? Bro, I said I need to pee. I already told you what to do. Why now? This not fair. What is our offense? Have some mercy. Keep quiet. He said he wants to pee. Allow him. Keep quiet. This is not fair. This is not fair. What is our crime? We didn't kill anyone. We're not different from you guys. Except for the small roger we collected. It's not fair. I need a crap. Crap in your pants. I really need to crap. And I said crap in your pants! Look at his face. The guy's going to shit and stink up this whole fucking place Let him stink the place up, I don't care. Suit yourself. But I'm not picking up anybody's shit! Fine. One hour. You hear me? One hour. If they behave, they get toilet privileges. And you fucking take them. As it is now, you are just an accomplice. You haven't done anything we cannot overlook. I beg, release us. Release us. Boy. This one is two drops. One before food and one after meal, okay? Come. Come here. This one. You chew it, but spit it out. Don't swallow the seeds. Now, this one, you make sure you put it under your pillow whenever you want sleep with your husband. I was wondering when we are going to get to the jazz part of things. Mum, you have a PhD in Applied Sciences, and you still believe in all these things. But this is not jazz now, this is natural alternative medicine. So see this one, you pour in your palm, add rub, add some oil though, and rub on your belly every night. Okay. So, these are all for me? Yes. Okay. Where are Brume's herbs? Where are they, Mum? - Najite, everything is for you. - I don't see them. So you knew that when the woman wants to have a baby, the man and the woman both have to contribute resources, all right? The X chromosome from the woman and X and Y chromosome from the man… Stop being condescending. Like you said, I have got a PhD. Now, this one, you make sure that… the urine drops in your tea, while this is blood tonic in case you're anemic. You add some of those juice into it - when boiling it. - You want me to drink the urine of a turtle? - You want me to drink its pee. - It's all natural! Somebody's son is in trouble tonight. Somebody's daughter is in trouble tonight. Move! Is this how you always allow him to bully you around? To tell you what to do and what not to do? Keep talking and you'll poop your pants. Sir. My friend. I have a deal to offer you. Shut up and get out! I know good people when I see them. My friend, you are a good man. You're merciful. You allowed him to go to toilet Are you mad at us? This is pure money. Clean. Just go. Go. I heard talking. What was he saying? He was just begging. Hey, look, I need a drink. You want one? Shut up. You hear me? Not a word from your mouth. Not a single fucking word, but screaming and shouting, screaming and shouting. Screaming and crying! What did we do? What is the matter with you? Please, sir. Please, let's talk. You know us from somewhere? Shut up! My squad get one retirement fund. Over $50 million. Isn't that what you and your friend are really after? Over three weeks ago, police arrest some armed robbers that robbed Senator Osita-Park's house. It's on the news. Now over 100 million. We find, but did not "declare" the full money. You know how this works. This is pure money. Clean. How much naira are we talking about? No. Not right now. Yeah, things are a little tense at the moment. Dammy. Dammy, listen, you of all people know what I went through. I lost everything, dude. Someone has to pay for that. You know what? No, that's no what I said. Fine. Never mind. We'll have this money conversation later, okay? Bye. Sheesh. Your mother, right? What makes you say that? Not much. Just that your stress lines double every time you speak to her. By the way, my mother is coming down this weekend. Isn't that something that we should have talked about? You know I can't tell her not to come. But we should have at least discussed it, babe. Yeah, that's what we're doing now, babe. We are discussing it All right, see you later. I gotta go. - Love you. - I love you. What's the matter, you don't like the food? You call this food? This is no food. This is a spiritual medical prescription. I can taste neem leaf. In jollof rice! She is only trying to help, okay? Just… And what else would I expect you to say? Sugar is not good for you. Happy now? I saw that. Now they've beaten us like small kids, when they gonna release us? When they come beat us again, I will ask them. Looks as if they are trying to gather evidence. Do you recognize them? Maybe. I'm not too sure. But the one that took me to the toilet is the weak link. He might be able to help us. How? How? I'm already sowing seeds. But the guy is not stupid. But I have plan B. You carry a stick against two guys with AK-47s? We just need to get our hands on one of the guns. Do you have a better idea? My friend. My friend, how about our discussion? I can see that you don't approve of what your brother is doing. You better just keep quiet. Look, you can gain something out of this. Fifty million dollars. And I know where we can get it. Please, I need to pee. Or you want me to piss my pants like my friend? Here is better. I didn't want to talk too much in front of Felix. Humor me, where is it? That would be like sending a penalty kick for a throw-in. - You know I can't tell you yet. - And you expect me to believe you? It's the truth. The money is buried somewhere. Somewhere close. Just release me and I can take you there. Bullshit. Just go. Okay. There is a video. It's on my phone. Just keep me alive and I will tell you more. I will tell you everything! I double dare you! Easy. Easy. Dead men tell no tales. Move! - All my kids are Canada bound! - Straight up. Who the hell is Beyoncé? She'll perform at my next birthday party. Pinch me, I must be dreaming. - This is no joking matter. - Why are you recording us? Just calm down, okay? She's just trying to help. For real? She's trying to help? Help who? Who is she trying to help, Brume? - Us. She's trying to help us. - Really? Please tell me how much tortoise extract have you drank in the past few days? How many roots have you chewed? Because I have eaten so much crap, that I've actually lost my sense of taste now. You know what? It's fine. I am just... I am done. I'm done. And there is absolutely nothing that anybody can do about it. I'm done. Fine. I mean, I don't understand you. How? How are you so fine with only me... Just me being pumped with all that crap? Okay, that's enough. Okay. You have disrespected my mother enough. How? How have I disrespected your sweet, sweet mother? Come on, Naj. She's only trying to help. She wants to carry her grandchild! Why am I the only one she's doing the help to? Don't you understand what I'm saying? Must I explain it to you like a child? She's old school. Okay. Of course she thinks it's your fault. She is educated right? She's an African mother. Education is secondary when it comes to traditional beliefs and superstition. That is just dumb, okay? That's not an African mother's thing. It's just dumb. Did you just call my mother dumb? Listen, I just... So what now? You want to flip the script? Stay on the subject, Brume. And what is the freaking subject? Did you tell your mother anything about me? What I told my dumb mother is none of your business. Brume, what did you tell her? I told her the truth. That… all of this might be your fault. There. I said it. How? How is any of this possibly my fault? How isn't it your fault? Tell me... Help me. Tell me, how is it my fault, Brume? We both got tested. Me and you, right? And they said there was nothing wrong with me. Well, there was nothing wrong with me too. But I wasn't the one who had an abortion for my ex. Come on. Hey. Babe, I'm really sorry about all of this. Okay. Like I said, I really didn't mean it. It's just my mom… And no, I'm not blaming it on her, I just… I am just sorry, okay? Please let me know that you are okay. I love you. Prime liver. Guess how much? Brume, what is going on with you? This thing? Can't be easy to do to another human being. Justice or not. Good. 'Cause I consider them less human. So why are you having second thoughts? Me? Second thoughts? Nah. I'm only salivating. Their bodies. Have you figured out what you're going to do with them? I think so. Well, care to share? Nah. I'd prefer you're less involved. It's for your own good. When I leave here, I'll eat recklessly. We don't see their face. We know their house. We are not leaving here alive! Why? - You said you have a plan, right? - What plan? That stick plan. We have to do something. Yeah? What can I do with a stick against two men with AK-47? That plan is gone. We have to do something, I cannot die today. Which day do you want to die? We're hungry! Or you want to starve us to death? - We can still walk away from all this! - Don't start! At least we need to feed them. - They deserve some... - Mercy? They deserve mercy? That's what you were about to say, isn't it? If we don't feed them, they're going to start suspecting where this is going and get violent. They're cuffed. Desperate men are dangerous men. All right. It's time then. Is it you or Anthony Joshua that cooked this rubbish? You better shut up and eat or I will pour the food on the ground and make you feed like dogs. It's not bad. Not so bad. Better than what we give them at the station. This is not even fit for my dog. Well, maybe Duke has better tastes than its owner. Duke? You live at Number 13, Arowolo Street. Your wife, she sells akara in a little kiosk in front of your house. On Sundays, she attends Miracle Ministries. Where she belongs to two groups. Prayer warriors and church welfare, correct? What is all this? What is all this? Eat up. You are going to need your strength. Stop! Stop or I'll shoot. Get him off me! Get him off me! I said stop! Do your worst! You act like a dog, and you get treated like one. I'm tired, sir. Please, release us. I want to go home. I want to go home. I can't take this anymore. Please, sir. If we defrauded you, we'll refund. Tell us what we did. I am only trying to survive. I am only trying to survive. Whatever we've done, please have mercy and forgive us. I'm doing this for my children. Please. I'm doing this for my children. I don't want them to suffer like this. I don't want them to end up like me. Please. Please. We are all trying to survive. What makes your own any different? Hey, people, come see how beautiful my wife is. And she's in the kitchen. Booyah! Wait, do you want to try this? It's hot. - Do you like it or not? - It's so good! You are so good, baby. Babe? What's going on? I love you so much. This is good. Thank you. Yes! Oh, my baby. What are you doing? Cooking. Or something that looks like it. Listen, I am two months in, okay. I am not handicapped. - Okay, please. - Okay, no. - What are you doing? - No. "Hey, people, come and save me. "My husband is doing up all the chores. "He loves me so much, it's suffocating." Very funny. There's no difference between you and your mother. Okay. And what is this anyway? You know you owe me an apology, right? I do? Yes, you do. What for? Pray tell. After berating me for all the herbs she was feeding you with, guess who's pregnant now? So she's not so dumb after all, right? Let me get you food. Are you okay? Yeah. No, you look… This isn't right. The heat must be getting to you, come. No, no, I'm fine. No, you're not, come here. - I am. - Just go. Put your feet up. Okay. Go. I'll get you the food when it's ready, okay? Let me serve this. The test can be performed in the eighth week of pregnancy. These are the forms, you can fill them out. If you change your mind… And this test is noninvasive, and the most accurate way during pregnancy? Yes. It's 99% accurate. It involves taking blood samples from the father and the mother to conduct a fetal cell analysis. Blood? You're going to need Brume's blood? But he won't do that without asking questions. Look, I can't lie to my patient. It would not be ethical. Dammy, Dammy, Brume can't know about this test. Listen, I know that he's your friend and that you're consulting for us as a couple, but listen, this has to stay between you and I. Dammy. There might be a way around it… Dammy, Brume cannot know about this test. Not yet. I legit don't understand her. I really thought after she got pregnant, she'll be better, but things have just gotten worse. She just cries all the flipping time. Did she tell you anything? Like what? I don't know. Like if there's anything digging at her. I really don't know, she doesn't talk to me. Listen, remember when we had that clash, right? Yeah. I said nasty things to her. Okay. - Things I shouldn't have said at all. - Yeah. Ever since then, she's just… Things haven't been the same. And I think she's right. Maybe I pushed her too far. Maybe... Maybe she's done, you know? Nah. Remember what my life used to be like before I met her? Dude, I was in a dark place. - I almost contemplated sui... - Hey. I remember. Crazy times. But that was all in the past. She's everything to me, man. You know. Dinner is ready, boys. I'm gonna go get the table ready. I'll come help. Listen, I am going to throw myself against a pile of rocks if you don't let me be. I'm pregnant, I'm not bedridden. See? Hey, she'll be fine and you'll be fine. All right? Yeah. My friend, I know we didn't conclude, but I hope that you have made up your mind? You've watched the video, right? So what if I've watched the video? You'll take us to the exact location where the money is. - We will go to confirm it and… - Sir, I'm not an idiot. The moment you get hold of the money, that's the end of our lives. Well, that means you lose either way. At least with my plan, you get a chance. Okay. Your friend, Anthony Joshua, we both know he's been trying to kill us. Do you know why? 'Cause he is the one my people gave the money to. And the money must be in this house too. See, we're not here by chance. Okay. Your friend? He is a banker, right? Look, there is a photo in the living room. Check it out. Your guy and one of our guys, Officer John Okoli. They know each other. If I show you where I think the money is in this house, will you at least let us live? Guy! Guy! Guy, make sure. I want carry one of these guys go toilets. Come watch the other one. Toilet again? Slowly. Look, the whole squad is supposed to split the money, but if three of us split it, you know how much that is per head? I know he's your friend, but I also know he's not going to allow us to walk through that gate alive. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. So, we have to knock him out. Suppose you give him more of what you put inside our champagne. There's still some left, right? Enough talk! Show me the money. Both of us know you can't afford to release us. And both of us know there's no money here either. Now is my turn. Turn around. Release him. - Release him. - Please, Brume. Brume, please release him. Please, please. Watch him. Drop your gun! After you! Okay, let me tell you what's happening now. Your guy here is bleeding to death like a fowl. After two seconds you no drop your gun, I'll go shoot! Story, drop your weapon or I blow his brains out! Officer. Officer, please. He will shoot. He's not lying. He has been preparing for this day for over six months. And I am a policeman. Trained to handle the gun he's holding for over 25 years. Go ahead. Please don't shoot. How many years' experience do you think I need to blow his brains out? Tell me. - I don't want to die. - See? Your friend here agrees with me. Drop your gun! You cannot! Felix, do not worry, I've tested him twice, he cannot shoot. God, I don't want to die. I don't want to die. Don't shoot. I am going to count to three. And that's it. Drop your gun or I'll shoot. Brume, please! Don't do this! Don't do this. One! They've got $55 million hidden somewhere. And you believe them? Come on, man. Come on. Come on. I know it won't change anything but at least let's get out of this with something. Tell him about the money now. You ask him, ask him. Ask him what he and Okoli did with the money. - Two! - Dammy, they're using your head. I don't want to die. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Fine, I'll help you. You better get back. Get back. - Stop, or I'll... - Or you'll what? You see this? Twenty-five years experience using this gun, right? Drop it. Dammy, are you okay? I can't believe you gave me an empty gun? You fucking risked my life, man. You did that all to yourself. Now focus. Here, apply pressure. I know. I'm a fucking doctor! Naj, I thought the earlier news would cheer you up. What's happening? Come on, babe. On the back seat is a sonogram of our babies. Twins, can you believe that? What? After all we've been through, this is the reward for patience. You know that? After all the tests. I had men groping my balls. Do you know that? But look at us now. Four years! Four years nothing and then, bam, two out of nowhere. This life. It's crazy. Imagine if we had adopted, we would have two extra mouths to feed. Maybe we should have adopted! Look, I don't understand you, to be honest. I don't. I don't know why you are not happy? - You should be happy! - Why are you so happy? - Why shouldn't I be happy? - Because they might not even be yours! What did you say? What did you say to me? Babe, I'm sorry. Sorry? Wait, wait, wait, sorry for what exactly? I made a mistake. I made a big, big mistake. - Baby, I'm sorry. - Don't touch me! I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry. I don't know. - It was a mistake. - Just shut up. Fuck! Stay away from me. Stay away from me! Who was it? Tell me, who did you cheat on me with? It was one of my exes. It was one of my exes. I'm sorry. I understand that you're upset, but I just want you to know that I love you, Brume. You are carrying another man's children. No. No. I said that... I said, "might." I said they might not be yours! It's not a sure thing, there's still a good chance. You expect me to believe that, right? Wake up. Siesta is over. Sir, please let me call my wife. She'll be very worried about me. Please. That ship has sailed. - Please! - Stop begging them. Why? What did we do? Do you remember how you got that gold watch? So this is all about a gold wristwatch. What do you want, officers, please? This is... I'm not just in the mood for this, I need to go home. I need to go home now. And we don't have homes to go to, right? Don't say anything. Not a word from you. Identify yourself. Or what? Identify myself or what? Can you hear him? This one is a proper fraudster. At least I told you. I didn't have to. I could have just kept... Najite, you cheated. You fucking cheated on me. Gosh, I never thought I'd ever say that in my entire life. - Where is your laptop? - What laptop? You want us to believe you don't have one? I do not have a laptop. You are hiding it from us, right? They are wasted, please be careful. Who is wasted? Did you hear what she said? - Two of you, come down from this car! - I'm sorry. You must think I'm kidding. - Come down from this vehicle… - I'm coming. …before I fire your head. What is the matter with you? Something wrong with you? Both of you are messing around with me. I'll teach you a lesson. Where is your laptop? It appears you have a death wish. Where is your laptop? Or I'll fire your head now. Officer, wait a minute, please. Officer. Please. Move away from here. What is your problem? You want to hurt me? Or you want to… Look at how beautiful you are. Beautiful lady, come give me something. Sit down there. What is the matter with this one? What happened to you? Shut up there. Check if there's anything else in there. You... You have the guts to slap me? And that was the end of my Najite. Mother of two unborn children. There was nothing they could do to save her. She died bleeding on the hospital bed. I didn't know. Please, have mercy. You didn't have mercy on my wife while you kicked her. Why should I have mercy on you? Please, have mercy! You don't have to do this. I have a family. I have children! Yes. You have a family. Two of your children attend Ansarudeen primary school close to your house. Your son is shit at his schoolwork because he is a truant, except on Fridays, when his teacher gives him sweets. - And your daughter… - What's the meaning of this? What's this? What? When you killed my wife, you gave me no choice. But I'll be merciful to you and give you one. Yes. Either you die and your wife and children live, or you live and they die. Choose. Choose, or I'll choose for you! I want to live. I want to live. I want to live. You are despicable! Get out. Get out. Go! No! No! What? Brume, no. Why? Fuck! Fuck! Brume, Brume, no. I will not beg you! I will not. The only thing worthwhile in your miserable life is your dog Duke. Too bad he won't miss you in dog heaven. Maybe I should have said Duke tastes better than its owner. You are a bastard. - Brume, Brume, listen. - You are a fucking bastard! Let just ask him about the money. Just tell us where the money is! Tell us where the money is! Tell us where the money is! Fuck! What the fuck! Why? - There is no money, he lied to you. - I saw it. Fifty-five million dollars, Brume. I saw it. I saw it with my own eyes. I said he lied to you, Dammy. He doesn't have it. Wait. The money is with you? Focus. There are more important things than money. This is about Najite. Fuck! What the fuck? Who did you cheat on me with? Who? Tell me now, who? No, no. Who? It was one of my exes. I trusted you. I fucking trusted you completely. Another man and I would've let it go. But you… You were my best friend. And you were her ex. And you never said a word about it. What? You want to blame me for this? It was your fault! You chased her back into my arms! - What the fuck was I supposed to do? - The right thing! The right fucking thing. Fucking another man's wife is the wrongest of wrongs! And you went and got her pregnant. - No. - Yes. - No. - Don't lie to me! No. The reason you're here is to get revenge, isn't it? For your unborn children. I saw the test results. It had your fucking signature, Mr. Doctor. But you're right. I didn't do enough. We share in the blame, all of this, you and me. She was… She was trying to protect your marriage, you fucking idiot. She was trying to protect your marriage. She was scared you'd put two and two together. Before she could... Before we could clear up the mess. That test… It wasn't your blood. It was mine. The results, they were mine. You fucking... You fucking liar! - It was negative. - You fucking liar! Negative. The babies were not mine, Brume. They were yours! They were yours. They were yours. They were yours. Everyone complains and no one does a damn thing about it except The Madman. A good friend once told me the human brain can stay functioning for up to 15 minutes after you're dead. It's not a sure thing. There's still a good chance. Or was it 50 minutes? I forget. You expect me to believe that? Well, I guess it's in these 15 or so minutes, I tell you this story.
