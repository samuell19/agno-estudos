[female voice] This...is the story of a story. Once upon a time, there was this... story, and the story said to itself, "How shall I begin?" [male voice] Try the usual way. What, in the dark? With a man and a woman and a story that's still to tell itself? Well, you've got to start somewhere. Say, "Long, long ago" or "Far, far away" or just "Once". That's good. "Far away" so you know the place is close to your own heart. "Once" is nice, so we know it always happens. Hmm. Once there was this... hero. Some hero. Some man, then. Any man. Say, a man, a woman, and some children. Don't forget the children. What's he doing now? Still building the fire. Hiding, you mean. He's scared of us? Some dad, huh? Ha ha... Well, it's been four years. He's getting fat. [giggling] So what's in the story? A man on a beach all washed up. A shipwreck. A heartbreak. Freedom? Betrayal, regrets, old shoes, a crust of bread, a bunch of roses. Could be my story. Anybody's story. A journey. A long, long journey. Yeah. That's the story. A long, long journey to... where, exactly? [giggling] Go home! Go on. [female voice] Once upon another time... so long ago, nobody had got around to caring whether the world was round or flat... there lived--in a cave-- a man, a woman, and some children. Grr... Grarr! Dada, look. Oww, ow! [sniffling] Inside the cave, it was as safe as... houses. And every day, they awoke into the only world they would ever know. [children laughing] Stay home. Dada's hunting. Go. Dada. No. Go home. Go. Maybe if the man knew the whole story, this very well might have been different. But this seemed a morning... like any other. [distant voices] [laughter] [shouting] [speaking barbarian language] [shouting] Go! We go! Move! Arrows. Up the hill. Beach. No. They're down there. I saw them. No. Other beach. No. Up the hill. Can't. Up hill! You're wrong. Oh, you're wrong, you're wrong. Shut up! [shouting] Go! Ma-mama! Leave me! Go on! Don't lose the children! Come, dada. I get food. Now, stay here. No noise. Don't move. Dada... Don't cry. Shh. Dada... Dada, come. Don't leave. [voices] [speaking barbarian language] [laughter] [voices] Of course the man had heard the stories of the wandering men, the ones who came and took everything. A story to frighten his children with. But up till now, that's all it was to him-- a story. [moaning softly] Yaaa! Mine! Mine! Yaaa! Yaa! Yaaa! Yaaa! [laughter] Mine! Mi-- And they all turned-- at a loss-- to the priest for guidance. He said, "Look up there. The stones. We should surely pay tribute." With these men, suddenly everything was out of kilter. As they led their captive by the rope, even the priest was hoping... when they got there, he'd somehow know... what to do. [speaking barbarian language] And the poet was already making up the story of this strange day. Not mine. Not my stones. The leader stared hard at these stones, thinking till his brain hurt. Was it to make the sun work? Was it supposed to be one man over, one stone on top, or what? [shouting] Huh? Oss. Oss. Oss. Oss? Uh... Oss! Oss. Oss. Schtorek... garre. Dada. Dada? [speaking barbarian language] Dada... Dada... Dada. If the world is round... you could still fall off the edge. No. It's not round like that. It's round like... this. You believe everything that Greek tells you? Where are we, then? Rome must be in the middle... here. So we must be out here... somewhere. Right. Another time, there's this man, and he had a woman and a child and a bed, but it was not his bed... not his child... not his woman. Everything he had, even his smallest humiliation, belonged to his master. [man] All must stop, Lucinnius. No sign of the ships. Bad omens, Hector. Bad omens. Everything's gone wrong since the earthquake. I knew that it was a sign. The gods were trying to tell me something. I think the gods were telling everybody something. What could be worse than to be a slave... unless... it's to be a slave to a foolish master. Bad omens, Hector. Not an omen, an accident. It's a bad omen. An accident. Get me something to eat. Spoiled his day, meeting your old man. Been avoiding him all week. The big bit. Not the big bit. His ships have gone as well, we heard. What have you heard? Last night. Nepos knew. Pirates. They're sunk, he reckoned. That could finish him, eh? This is the worst it's been. He'll be up for sale before you know it. Ha ha... Will he lend you the money? He was honest about it. He said so plain, simple, No. That's a problem. He didn't want any rope? No. And the ships have gone. I know. I told you? No. But you knew? Yes. Who told you? Julian's men. Who told them? Nepos. Then Cyprian knows already. He'll want his money back, too. You get a chicken and fetch Hermas the diviner. Are my ships from Sicily still afloat? No, no. Offer the grain first. Sprinkle some on the altar. Making another sacrifice, father? Shh. Leave us alone. And we can't ask the gods specific questions. It's a gentle, probing inquiry. General questions. Well, let's see. General answer-- No. What do you mean? The liver says no. Do it again. I want you to do it again. Is it the gods' will that Cyprian... be well-disposed towards me... in the future? Doing it again means another chicken... and another 15 sesterces. I'll have my first 15 now, please. And, uh, that's 2 for the chicken. It was our chicken. Oh, yes. Of course. Sorry. It's all right. Cyprian loaned me half a million to fit out these ships. I'm finished. Just when things were going well. I had plans for you, too, Hector. In four or five years, I was going to make you free. You could've found your family, brought them here, everything. Sounds good. It does, doesn't it? I shouldn't give up. I can't. I'll visit Cyprian... first thing tomorrow before the others get to him. He's got to see reason. I can pay him back... sometime. It's the only chance we have, Hector. Should I do it? You must. You're right. I must. Thalia, I think I need one of your massages. Hector, you can finish the lamps. Lower, Thalia. Ahh... lower. Ahh... [snoring] [thunder] Why does the thunder always stay out at sea? It thundered like that before the earthquake, remember? If he goes down, I'm asking for my freedom. He owes it to me. And yours, too. We'd be free. Then what? What do you mean? What we talk about. We talk about going home. Yours is that way... mine is that way. Your family's that way. I made that up. I don't know where they are. We can't talk about families anymore. It's been too long. It's what you talk-- We talk about it because it can never happen. It's just you and me now. Save your breath for blowing in my ear. I think you'll leave. You are going to leave me here. Shh. And, every morning, the man awoke into the only world he would ever know. I can't sleep. Get me a chicken. I want to make another sacrifice. We'll do it ourselves. [rooster crows] We'll be first, Hector. Definitely. No one else will be there. Not this early. Were they friends? Well, they were as close to friends as a master and a slave can be. I'm Cyprian-- I mean, Lucinnius. I've come to see Cyprian. Do you have a gift? A gift? No. Join the line on the left. Thank you. Leave the stool. And as his master went in to meet the master of his fate, the slave was free, free to feel the sun on his back and squat in the dirt amongst the litter carriers and chicken imitators. Cock-a-doodle-dooo... Bawk bawk bawk bawk... You seem much happier. Relieved, anyway. Relieved that it's over at last. So... He's going to help you? I have to kill myself by tomorrow morning. He has my letters to Titanius. None got through. He says it's treason. He says I should want to die. I'm done for, Hector. [man imitating chicken] It's strange. I--I feel kind of good now. The struggle is over. Ha ha ha... Ah, we've seen it through together, eh? Let's get home. We've a lot to do. Tonight... peace at last. I don't feel so good about it now. You don't have to do it. If I don't, they will. He made that clear. They need a sacrifice, and I'm it. [laughing] Why is he always laughing? What's he got to be happy about? Why is everybody so happy? 'Cause they're not me, that's why. Let's go home. No. No, I can't. [laughter] We'll do it with a knife, Hector, when everyone has gone to bed. The two of us... to the end. I don't understand. What can I do? I couldn't help you die. We'll help each other. We must. We've been through this whole mess together. You don't understand, do you? I'm asking you to die with me. You're my closest, my dearest slave. What would they say about me if you refuse to die with me? You keep saying "we". Why we? Wh-what have I done? I've done nothing. I--I know nothing... At Cyprian's this morning, I had to sign certain papers, tell a bit of a story. What kind of story? A confession. That we were plotting against Cyprian and the provincial senate and were short of names. Most of the people I know were in the room, people I thought were my friends. So I mentioned you. And what did I do? You stole money from Cyprian to bribe and corrupt members of the senate. You're a rebel against the state-- nasty piece of work. Can I sit down? Of course. Do you think we go anywhere else when we die? I don't know. They say so. I hope not. I just... want it to stop. Just stop. If I die a slave, will I be a slave forever? I would think so, wouldn't you? I'm sorry, Hector. But I would be honored... if you would die with me. Father, can I talk to you? Not now. I want to tell you about the world. You can tell me... later. Thanks, Hector. If he eats the grain, it means yes. He's eating. He's saying yes. Yes, we should die. You asked if we had to die or if there's another way. It's saying, "yes, there's another way". No, it's saying, "yes, we should die". What? Get the knife. We'll do it the other way. Solus, I'm eating chicken again. I ate chicken yesterday and the day before that. Will I be eating chicken again tomorrow? Why am I always eating chicken? That's what we have in the kitchen. The chickens have just been turning up. Two men have come to see you... from Cyprian. Good evening, Lucinnius. Cyprian sent us to ask if we could be of any assistance in the business you have to conduct tonight, to make that business as comfortable as you would wish. Uh... Thank you, gentlemen. I will be capable of taking care of my affairs tonight without your help. Thank Cyprian for his kind thought. We're spending the night at the house of Nepos across the street. Don't hesitate to send your man for us. We're anxious that things go well for you. Thank you. Good night. We'll call in the morning. Good night. Thank you. He looks like the kind that's going to need some help. You ever killed before? Just a couple of chickens. It's not much different. Use a thin blade, but long. Get it in deep, the heart. Go between the ribs. Or go in from the back, any place he'll let you. Getting it out's not as easy as you'd think. You have to twist to get over the stickiness. If it gets messy, you come and get us. If we're going to die, can I die a free man? I don't want to die a slave. Very well, Hector, you're free. I don't know the exact words. I've never done it before. Can you put that in writing so when they find me in the morning, they'll know I died a free man? Very well. It's a nice thought. You were right to ask. Thank you. Well, freed man, let's do it. What do you want me to do? Nothing. Not--not to me. I have to do it first. You understand? I understand. And then you. No. Oh. Oh. Oh. If I don't succeed... Stop it, Hector. Then you... You must help me. Oh. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Aah! Aah! Aah! I can't do it! I can't! [crying] I can't! Aah! I did it. On the stairs I did it. It hurts. It stings. This is hopeless. Help me. You've done it. Lie down. Lie down. Better? Thank you. Thank you. Close your eyes. You did it. You do it now, Hector. Be still. Hurry! Do it. Do it. You promised. I'll need the knife. Take it. Do it, Hector. Oh! Take it, Hector. Take it, take it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. And so... wearing his master's cloak, best foot forward in a dead man's shoes, the man walked out into his own story... Come on. A free man. The captain wants to see you. Up there. But that is another story. [priest] We want to praise god because we live in this ultimate age when all things are done. O.K., this man... he'd been through the wars, and he'd been traveling a long time through strange lands, but he was on his way home. [priest] All god's chosen gathered in paradise. I struggle against it. I will not join myself carnally with any woman. I will carry my unspilt seed from this world to the next, as should every man. I've written a small treatise in favor of virginity, sister. We could discuss it later, if you like. What are you talking about? It's simple, brother. If we cease carnal union entirely, in 50 or so years, we'll all be rid of our earthly lives, and god can proceed with his reign over his heavenly kingdom, that same paradise that god gave to man before, but which man was so unfit to inhabit that within seven hours, Eve was already tempting her master and mate, and within nine hours, the lord had to expel the both of them. [urinating] [shouting] [horse whinnies] [sword fight] Help me! A bit cold for a walk. [speaking Italian] I don't know what you're saying. [speaking Italian] A man, a woman, neither speaks the other's language. They understand nothing. "Well," said the story to itself, "I suppose I must be a... a love story." Keep out of the way of temptation. I saw the way you were eyeing that widow. If anyone's going to dally with her, it will be me. You couldn't handle her. She'd bewitch you. Why don't you get off up the road tomorrow? I'll catch up in a few days. No. Why do I talk so much? You weren't even thinking of her till I opened my mouth. But I trust you, Hector. You're not a sinner. You wouldn't do anything to anger your god or me. Give me some bread. No. Why, you little squirrel? What's wrong with you? Nothing at all. I just said no. I brought it because I was near the table, not because you ordered. This woman's got to you. It's not her. I'm fed up being like your slave. I want to go my own way. In a month, we'll be at the channel, then home. The little ones that you talk about when you're drunk, don't forget 'em. I won't. I'm going home. Give me some wine. No. May the lord forgive us for our sins-- Those we have committed... and those we as yet only dream of. Ha ha. And so it was, as it ever was. The country they traveled through was troubled times. The weather was wars, as regular as rainstorms. Love broke out like epidemics of the plague. [moaning] You, priest, get to work on him. He's not ready for heaven yet. There's 100,000 on his head if I get him to Paris alive. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. [speaking Italian] Why do you speak so different from everyone else? [moaning] You must be sore. Was it your dada? If his head's small, he might be O.K. Does your dada got a big head? [moaning] Are you a long way from home? Home. Home. [speaking Italian] No, I don't want your word for home. I want you to say mine. Casa. Casa. Casa. Casa. Ha ha ha. Casa. Pulce. Un pulce. A flea? Pulce. Flea. All right. You itch? [horse snorts] My name is Peter--Peter. Say it again. Goodbye, Peter. You're a busy man. There's nothing wrong with helping someone die in peace. Nothing at all. You do it well. You're leaving? Aye. I feel lost, Ronald. I'm far away from home. I just want to be there. What about the woman? We're sharing a few days on the road. I'm going home. I told you she might be a witch. Witch, my ass. Wait for me. I still have the money from Venice. We can get home in a month. You've got work to do here. You'll make a good priest yet. Do you think so? You're a strange fellow. I've been with you a year, and I still don't know who you are. You never will. Are you a priest? I don't know. We're moving soon, father. They need you in the valley. I must be. I can smell her off you. Keep the sun on your back, and you'll get home. [Beatrice] Hector. Hector. [speaking Italian] And so this man... who so long did not know which foot to put in front of the other unless he had his friend to follow, without a qualm, for once, went his own way, which was the way of a woman. [speaking Italian] Only when the woman slept could the man catch his breath. [speaking Italian in her sleep] [wolf howls] [birds tweet] I bought that in Jerusalem. It's one of the cups from the last supper. I don't know which apostle. Might even be the cup of Christ himself. Christ? Aye. Jesus Christ? Oh. Hey, you! Move on! He's a dead man. What was the story of the dead boy? A mystery-- Money? Revenge? A jealous uncle? A war is a good time to settle old scores. [speaking Italian] [praying in Italian] By the dead boy, the living lovers loved. You put magic in that stuff, didn't you? You're bewitching me. I don't know what you're saying, but I like it when you talk. [singing in Italian] Thank you. Until one fine day, they crossed a river, and... [speaking Italian] everyone spoke like her. Beatrice... wait. We're going the wrong way. I've got to have the sun on my back. My back. [speaking Italian] No, the sun on my back. Lower. [singing in Italian] Thank you. Wash? You want me to rest? Man's dead? His clothes. You want me to stay, don't you? I like that. A bed. Soft. Better than a field, aye? [boy calling in Italian] Mama... [speaking Italian] Questo Hector. Questo mio madre. Huh? And the dead boy's shoes danced the live lad's feet. What's that? [speaking Italian] Where were his own children? Far away, right? What were the wonders they'd be showing some sweet stranger who wasn't their father? Bread, you eat? Blue. Your mother wears blue. Roses, oh. Smell. Oh, that's nice. In there? Mama. [bird squawks] Buon. Hector. [speaking Italian] I have to leave here. It would be wrong to stay here, even for just a while. I've got to go to home. This was true. He could not speak her language, so he'd not needed to learn to lie. Sorry I have to go. I've got a family... like you. Like you. Oh, you smell good. I've got to keep the sun on my back. Hector. Mama. You'd think the man would have wanted another helping of chicken stew. Second-day stew is always better. You'd think he'd have been content with another man's coat, for there was plenty of wear in it and precious few patches. You'd think the man would've wanted just one night in the woman's bed, for is not a feather bed softer than a ditch? But a man... this man... could not be happy with such happiness. He walked on his own two feet... forever out of this woman's story. That's it. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Tomorrow the boatman would be back, and he could cross over. Only this fine morning, the man crossed the river, but before night fell, he'd left his lover. [cough cough] [singing in Spanish] Andre. Hmm? I just had a wonderful dream. I was lying beside a river. I heard the water. It was beautiful, clear water. I drank some. I think I ate some raspberries, too. Hmm. I would like to drink some water. They've been doing that all night? Mmm... Ever since we came ashore. You remember that. What happened to Francisco and Ursula? They're safe. Where are they? Over there. Sometimes one day changes everything. Sometimes years change nothing. I won't look. Do you think I'll still see Europe? I think there's more of a chance of me eating you. [father Diogo] God has seen fit to preserve us for six days on this raft and bring us safely to shore. I don't think he'll abandon us now, so let's get to work, my friends. Come, come. Africa must be full of meat and drink. See, there's this man, and he wakes up into the only world he'll ever know-- shipwrecked, washed up. The worst of it is, he's washed up once again with the lover he had so cruelly forsaken. Where's the small box? We had it on the raft. Dona. Dona Ursula. Let me help. I'll get it. Allow me, please. No. Let me help. Let me help you. Leave me alone! Don't be a martyr. Let me have it. Señor Hector. Uhh! [Andre] Come and help me. Let me help. Don't. [Andre] Look. I found the box. I'm sorry. What was the story between this man and this woman? Shipwreck? Heartbreak? The usual. Yeah, lots of different stories washed up on this shore. How many made it? 80 men, 10 women, 18 children, and 45 slaves. 10 women? We got you a big chair. Where do you want it, in or out? Out. We got your table, sir. Where do you want it? Uh, right there, please. Hurry up with that table! I've lost a rather valuable ring, and I'd like it to be found. Please. Francisco, I have some cloth and carpet. I thought if we worked together, we could make a better shelter. At least ask dona Ursula. I don't have to ask her. I know she'd agree with me. Leave us alone. Well, at least take the cloth. The carpet, the cloth. Keep it. Build your own hovel somewhere else. Leave her alone, Hector. Francisco, I have some rope. Thanks, Nuno. I'll see you later. All right. Life is harder now. Where's my hat? It's in the bag. Dear god. Nothing. Send 2 parties of 10 men each-- one to the north, one to the south. Bring back what you can-- Game, fruit, anything. Are you serious? Send someone back when you find fresh water. Any trouble, discharge three shots. No, j-just one. One shot, perhaps two. [gunshot] Ohh! Ohh! [bang] [bang] [bang] [bang] They run off with the dried bread, sir, And most of the fresh water. There were eight of them. We got these two. Why were you running away? Why were you leaving us? You men are deserters, and you will die tomorrow. With all respect, these sentences can't be lawful. You don't think so? Of course not. They must hang. They were stealing our bread. I didn't steal any bread. Gomes stole the bread. He's away. [Dom Paulo] What do you think, father? I'll comfort them whether they live or die. [Francisco] There must be proper justice. [deserter] I didn't steal any bread. [Salgado] You must decide, sir. Gomes told us to run. [Dom Paulo] I'll decide! No, I won't. We'll all decide. Most of the people that matter are here. We'll have a vote. Who agrees with Salgado and me that they should die? And those against death? You can't vote! This isn't working out, dom Paulo. We need authority. You must decide. Very well. Da Cunha. Sir? The cross the carpenter's working on, have him turn it into a scaffold. Have it erected away from the women. Executions will be at sunrise tomorrow. Tell father Diogo. Take them to the raft. Are we all in agreement with hanging? Should we shoot them or what? Hanging is fine, sir. Very well. Who's going to conduct the executions? Shall we choose someone Or have a volunteer? Hector. I'm not good with ropes. I can barely tie my own shoes. I'll do it. At sunrise tomorrow. Send the priest to them tonight. He found your ring. Me. We found it. Well... thank you. I found it. Good work, Andre. Thank you. You go sleep by the big fire. Oh... Yes. Good night. Well, they were as close to friends as a master and a slave can be. Keep warm. I'll try! And the woman... Well, perhaps they were as close to friends as two old lovers can be. Hector? One moment. Oh! Nuno. Here's what they found. There are four for each of us. They taste kind of milky, but sour. Thank you, Nuno. My mother ate three and she was sick, so try two. But she was sick before. Maybe you can try three. I'll start with two. Hector, Lopo, the boy they're going to hang tomorrow, he was my friend on the ship. I was going to take him something to eat. I thought... maybe two of yours and two of mine? What about tomorrow, Nuno? What am I going to eat tomorrow? Dom Paulo would call it a waste. [women singing] You've got to keep yourself strong. That's what he'd say. God knows what's going to happen to us. We need you to be strong. What if I take one to Lopo and the other to dona Ursula from you? Thank you. And if they don't let you talk to Lopo, give them both to the lady. Thank you, Hector. Thank you. So, what was the priest to do but bless the men? There's water for one more day. What do we do then? Keep hanging people. That'll solve the problem. I wish they'd hurry up with these two. Hector! What? Hector, please! Hector. Yes? Thanks for the fruit, Hector. Promise me when we're dead you won't let them eat us. They said they would. Who said that? That was a joke. That was a joke. You won't eat us, will you, Hector? Oh, no. I won't eat you, Lopo. Thank you. You won't eat me, either? Oh, god, no. I'd never eat you. No offense. Thanks. You're welcome. Come on. I'm going to walk. I want to walk! Please let me walk, for god's sake! Please let me walk! Everyone kept their distance. What now? God knows. Like any priest anywhere, all he wanted was a sign. We're being watched. We're being watched. I bet some gunpowder would scare them. No. They might be friendly. Then they'll have food. That's right. We mustn't be timid. You. Go and talk to them. No. Go on. Go on. Get up there. That's right. Be friendly. Smile. Go on. Don't you want a little drink of water? Go, go, go, go. Oh...god. What's this? A bit of bread and raisins. Thought everything had been shared on the raft. Well, that wasn't. It's for her... and for you. I must speak to her. He could talk to them. There's just the two. Their leader arrives tomorrow. Well, thank god we're safe. Oh. And they said not to sacrifice any more men for them. They don't like that. They don't like that. Nuno! It's stuff from the ship! Did you give her the fruit? Yes. What did she say? She said thank you. Anything else? Well, go on. Run! Don't just stand there. See if there's anything. Run! Look at it! Ha! Just look. [laughing] Look at that! Right up on the beach! Turtle eggs. Dr. Correa was shipping them to the royal zoo. I think he was hoping they were going to hatch. Eggs for supper tonight for everyone! Eggs! Eggs! Eggs! Why is she doing this to me? Why won't she let me speak to her? [women singing] Oh! You'd think in this awful situation-- death and pain all around her-- that she'd want to reconcile herself to someone who cares for her. Why can't I see her? I just want to apologize. Oh... You have any eggs left? The slaves only got three. Yours were fine? Yes. I'm unlucky, Andre. I'm unlucky with women, I'm unlucky with eggs. Have you eaten all of your eggs? Yes. At least one of us is well-fed, huh? How are you doing, Andre? I only have one small problem. You still keep calling me Andre. Oh, god. I'm sorry. I did promise, didn't I? I want to die... at least with my real name. Indro... Indrabooti Fadradakeeli. Now I remember why we call you Andre. Indrapoo-- Indrapoop- Indra-- Indraboot... Indrabooti Fadradakeeli. Indrabooti Fadrabak-- Fadrabakeemi. Indrabooti Fachabak... Ohh. Ohh. Five deaths this morning. We've stopped people eating the fruit, but some people just ate too many eggs. The nuns have gone. How many eggs did you have? Three. I had them boiled. I had four. I don't feel very well. Four's all right. The really sick ones had 8, 10. Let's not talk about it. What do you have? We'll have to trade for food. They'll go for this--copper... nails. We're going to meet a king today. Hup. Dom Paulo, they've arrived. Excellent. That's it? [mules braying] Where's the king? He's not a real king, But they are his camels. [speaking native language] He doesn't know if you're real. He wants to see your navel so he'll be sure you were born like real people. My navel? You four also. Now he wants to see you breathe. Breathe. Breathe. And it shall be called the way of holiness. The unclean shall not pass... and the thirsty land springs of water. Water. And the mule. And the mule. So many stories-- crosses, eggs, nails, shipwrecks, hanged men, feasts, ropes, corpses, bread, wine, lovers. Suck out the marrow. That's the best bit. But in the end, isn't every story all the one story? Where's Francisco? Dona Ursula's sick. [Da Cunha] What about the sick? How are they going to walk? I'm staying here. I'm going to work on that raft, then I'm sailing home. You can't. They've taken all the nails! What about them, dom Paulo? I've been discussing it with father Diogo. I can't see how a hundred of us can carry back 70 sick. Going to take your big cross into the desert, Diogo? I thought we'd make a smaller one. [laughing] I'm going to search the scriptures tonight to find an answer. An excuse, you mean. Francisco. Will you share a bottle of wine with me? I've had it since we left the ship, and I want to drink it tonight with you. You should hang for this. Some of the people might have lived with a glass of this in their stomachs. We'll save Ursula a glass. Yeah, we will. The natives are taking us to water. We're leaving tomorrow. She won't be traveling anywhere. I'm staying with her. I know. That's why I had to see you tonight. So you want to tidy things up before you leave? Put your conscience to rest? Not just for me. For all of us. The pain and effort she puts into despising me must be tormenting her... and you and I. Am I selfish to want to stop that? I'm your friend, Hector. Your only mistake was getting on the same ship home. I never meant to get on your damn ship. If I hadn't gotten on that ship, I'd be home now, safe. Understand me. Tomorrow you're leaving. Ursula and me, we're staying. Believe me, many things no longer matter to us, Ursula and me. Vanities, hurts from the past, they're nothing. They no longer have meaning. This is my last bottle of wine. I think tomorrow she'll talk to you. You do? I do. And what does it matter? I'll never forget you or what you're doing for these poor people. Good luck to you. It breaks my heart to leave you like this. What else can I do? God protect you. Well. We're leaving the big cross with you. Oh. Thank you. And I'll comfort them as best I can. You're staying? No. No. I'll comfort them before we leave. I think my place is with you, don't you? I think so. I'll ask her. In you go. Thank you for seeing me. I don't have much to say except I'm sorry for all the hurt I've caused you. There are so many things I could explain. How we stupidly misunderstand each other. Later we can talk. Later? Yes. Later. There's no later. I'm leaving now. You're leaving? Yes. You're not staying with us? I'm living-- leaving with the others, and I want to tell you that I will pray for your soul in Lisbon. Oh, you'll pray for my soul in Lisbon? Yes. I will. At the cathedral? At the cathedral. Every day. [laughs] Oh... Goodbye, Hector. Have a pleasant journey. I'll try. What? Ursula, don't turn away. I have so much more to say to you. We seem to be misunderstanding each other again. Idiot. You've made your peace with her? I think so. Yes. Thank god. Well... Goodbye. You want me to take anything back for you? A message, letter? If you were carrying something for me, I'd have to worry about you. If you go empty-handed, I can put you out of my mind. I want to ask you something. There's no easy way to do it. Go on, Hector. Your boots. What about them? Can I have them? You can have my shoes. They're perfect for here. I've got to walk 600 miles, Francisco. 600 miles in these sandals. Yes. You're right. I daresay my boots would take you 600 miles. I look after them. I'll look after them, too. I'll walk all the way home, and I'll remember you in the cathedral in Lisbon. In my boots? Yes. Oh... Hector, you have surpassed yourself. Sit down. Take my boots. Really? Yes. Go on. [laughing] Oh. These are fabulous. Are they made by Da Fosco? Ohh. Best bootmaker in Goa. Oh. Hey. Pray for my soul in Lisbon, Hector. I will, Francisco. Pray for your own. Ha ha ha ha. You really think you're going to walk out of here, don't you? All the way home, Francisco. Those are fine boots. Aren't they? They look a bit big for you. Probably more my size. No. They're fine. Boots the wrong size are worse than no boots at all. Really? Aah! Oh. [speaking foreign language] Ya. Brooklyn. I'm going to Queens. Do you know the lady? Think you'll go to jail again? Will you release some public comment to the press? Will you talk to us? Oh, Anna. Thank god. Yeah. Listen, I'm at that building in Queens. Oh. I need your help. Come get me. Yeah. There's cops, dogs, everything. I'm all right. I need your car. I don't have time to get the rental car. They won't let me out of the building, Anna. Building warrant, license... I'm calm. I'm all right. Here's what you do. It's not my building. It's my partner's building. I took the call. I came to see if I could help. Slow down, troup. So, it's 3:15 on a Friday. You are staying here until mr. Santiago gets the paperwork. Get your partner over here. This is serious. It's 3:35. I might have to close the place. Why? What happened? I danced with a prince on my 18th birthday! And now look at me! I warn you Monday! I told you the floor was making noises. It wasn't me, mrs... Philippopilis. Philippopilis. Oh, castrate you... Are you all right? My son sees his mother laying here... he gonna sue you! I'm not the landlord, mrs. Philippopilis. Yeah. I'm at the building. She fell through the floor on her toilet. It's not funny. No. You get down here. Why'd you do this to me, Boris? They want all sorts of documents. The place is crawling with-- Oh, yeah. [speaking Greek] Mrs. Philippopilis, this is my lawyer. He wants to ask a question. This place is a mess! Mrs. P, you poor thing! That doesn't sound good, Leonard. I don't think... Hey, troup... You moving out, mrs. P? Is the apartment going to be available? He's not going to the hospital. I've got a family emergency. Emergency? What do you call this? All right, listen. O.K., um, listen, how's Tuesday for you, George? I'm no good in the morning. Maybe in the afternoon I could meet you in the hospital. I'll bring flowers. Fuck flowers. Who'll pay for this? Who'll check her in the hospital? Your building fell down. It's not my building. They won't let me leave. They'll love this in court. You didn't even ride to the hospital? You got a credit card or something? Yeah. Wait. The guy you want is right there. Can I get him? That's my partner. Can I bring him back? Well, they were as close to friends as two mutual slaves to money may be. Boris, asshole, it's never been this bad. Did you bring all the papers? Yes. We seem to be covered for everything. What do you mean "we"? [siren] Hey, it's your problem. How is she? She's a fucking voodoo witch. She didn't break a single bone. She's yelling at me, "Jump through. Break both legs." Why did you fuck me on this? Why? I didn't-- Listen, I'm sorry. I just put your name on the lousy forms. I didn't plan this. I told you, don't do that anymore, O.K.? Just stop doing that. It's my name, O.K.? My name is mine. Use your name on the forms. Remember that? Remember your name? I got it. Boris Borlanski! Don't let it spoil your weekend. You haven't seen these kids for four years. I'll take care of it. Who's in charge up there? Cobb. I don't know him. Cobb... All right. Go on. I promise you'll walk away from this. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I blew up at you. You got to get out of this business. Here she is. Enjoy your weekend. I'll straighten everything out. Good luck. It's never been this bad, Boris. Everything can be fixed. Always. What's up? Am I glad to see you. Hi. Uh... You can drop me off at the shop, right? Yeah. You bring my bag? Yep. Where is it? It's back there. Your camera's in there, too. Thanks. Take some photographs of the kids. I will. That's nice. Thanks. Don't worry. Come on, relax. This is the beginning of something, not the end. Yeah. I'm jealous. You're going to start to be a father again. Thanks for talking me into this. You were totally ready. You're right. I am ready, aren't I? It's been long enough. I'm ready. Oh. I'm going to fix that shit with Boris. Good. I can't go on. No. I want my freedom. And the kids-- it's going to work out, isn't it? When it does, they can come over, right? That was the plan. When we get a bigger space. That's all we need. We'll get a big apartment together. You just said a bigger apartment together. I said that, didn't I? Yeah. What? Hector. What? You're a man of decisions today. I like this! I am. Now get out of my car. I don't want to drive around the block. Already it's your car. What's the freedom part? Freedom's from Boris, not you. I'm your slave. I'm your love slave. You know? Come on. Thanks for the car and everything. Do the best you can with them. I will. what are those? Oh, my god! You have to deliver them! I don't have time. It's two blocks before the bridge. It's a five-minute detour. Who died? Nobody died. It's a golden wedding. Yeah? Listen, please don't ask me to do this, O.K.? Honey... Please. Honey... What? You have to. You want my car? You need my car? This is how we help each other. This is a relationship. All right. All right. Thanks. Phone if there are any catastrophes. Don't suffer alone, asshole. [chuckles] Thanks. Hector! What? No gas. Great. Hector, have a great time! [horn honks] And once again, the man crossed the river. Don't stop. Hell. [honk honk] [siren] Hello, Hector. You made it. The kids are just coming. They're not crazy about going to the beach house, I should warn you. I would have made other plans. I thought this was a good way to start, but maybe it isn't. You should be allowed to make your own mistakes. It's just for a couple of nights. They can take it. Check into a hotel if it gets to be too bad. They love room service. Come on, guys. Let's go. Your father's waiting. Here's where we'll be if anything crops up. Thanks for the break. Maybe this is a little sudden for them. I should come by a couple of nights and get to know them that way. By Monday, you'll know them. You've grown. Well, here he is-- the invisible dad. That's what they call you. Hi. Hi. Hi. Well, you three have a good weekend. If it gets too miserable at the beach house, your dad will take you to a hotel. Good luck, Hector. Thanks. See you Monday, Hector. Are these flowers for mom? Oh, god! Gee! What have I done? Ohh... No. What's wrong? A lot. I can't face her just now. Let's go. [car honks] Have a nice time. Portable phone. You want to make any calls? Tom? No. And it's Thomas. But we called you Tom. That's what's on your birth certificate. I changed it. O.K...it's your name. You can do what you want with it. Hey, you guys, you got to help me here. We need supplies before we get there. Keep your eyes peeled for a supermarket. We also need gas. Oh, god, we really need gas. We're running on fumes here. Steaks. What? Let me keep a couple of steaks. Give the chickens a break this weekend, O.K.? Want some hamburger, too? O.K. Obviously, we stay away from the luncheon meats, huh? What was wrong with that? It's just kitchen towel. It's paper. It's bleached, and it wasn't recycled. This is better for the planet? Mm-hmm. You don't recycle? No. You just buy junk. I don't eat steak. I eat chicken. What's this? Those are sweet rolls. You like sweet rolls, Thomas? No. Why don't you ask us what we like? It'll save you money. You buy junk, we won't eat it. Why don't you show me? I'll just tag along. You know what you like. I do it every week anyway. She does. She tells us what to eat. We let her. O.K. She seems to know. Are you Anna? Who? The name on the car. No, I'm not Anna. She's my friend. She loaned me the car. Your girlfriend? A good friend. Very close. What about the flowers? They look like they should be delivered to somebody. Is that your job? Something like that. I get it. But you're not going to. Well, I forgot. I was slightly distracted. You know, that happens. Now we're on the wrong side of town. That's it? Yeah, that's it... I guess. I see. You're not seeing me at my best today. [tv] O.K., so you're an aquarius on the cusp of pisces. What can I do for you today? I'm thinking about moving. You're thinking about moving. You mean out of your house? Is that what you mean? Far away. Be as specific as you can. Hone in on the problem that you have. I'm thinking about moving to California, Rob. Let's see what the stones say about that. I can see a move to California. The stones are a little tentative, and they're wanting to know why you want to move to California. We passed the fun fair last night. Why don't we take a walk there today? We don't go to fun fairs. Let's just take a walk. I brought some books. I want to stay home and read. No. Let's take a walk. All right? Fine. Good. Don't tell me-- Donald. Yep. In a gale, it just about powers the radio. It seems to want to make the house fly at the same time. What are you doing? This is a metal detector. Donald give you that? Yep. He's a regular mr. Wizard-- Donald. I guess you could say that. Donald's shoes leak. O.K., give me $10 worth. Here you go. Thank you. Thank you. Well, let's go. Let's go have fun. Both of Donald's shoes leak. Hey, let's go on the ferris wheel. It makes me sick. How about the bumper cars? Those are great. No. No. O.K. Hey, look, a roller coaster. How about that? Nah. No. I don't want to waste these tickets. Let's go on this. Three, please. Here you go, bets. The seats are wet. Didn't count on a kitchen towel. Unbleached, biodegradable, and recyclable dry seats. Huh? Ha ha ha. Here you go, Thomas. Thanks. This is ridiculous. Let's go someplace and talk, O.K.? All right. If you want to. How do you land these things? Lots of people get divorced. Doesn't mean they disappear. You're right. After that, I went kind of crazy... for a long time. I did come to see you a couple of times. You remember? No. Not really. It wasn't very easy. She and Donald happened so quickly. I missed you terribly. I thought I should stay away until your mother got settled. That's not the truth. I missed you, but I was still crazy. We got married so young. All that freedom went to my head. Then you moved to New Jersey. It's 40 minutes away on a slow bus. You're right. Not too many excuses for the first year. The second, it's easier. I was in jail. What for? I was working for the government doing big contracts. There's a lot of money in that... and a lot of temptations. My boss asked me to juggle a couple of papers. I did, and I got caught, and I had to testify against him. It was like killing somebody. Well, Thomas wanted to visit you in jail, but mom wouldn't let him. You did? We didn't even know when you got out. I wasn't in great shape, and I didn't want you to see me like that. I went back to work in real estate with this guy I met in jail. He's a good guy. He's a good man, really. He's my partner, but he's also my friend. What about your girlfriend? Anna... Oh... She's nice. She can't wait to see you guys. She likes flowers. Well, you know that. Monday she'll probably kill me. So you haven't been staying away because of us? What do you mean? Is that what you think, I was avoiding you two? You mustn't think that, all right? That's terrible, uh... I left you two, didn't I? I left you all alone. We weren't all alone. The rain stopped. You want to go? I didn't leave because it was two days before your swimming test. It was just a day your mother and I decided. But you weren't there. I'm sorry. It doesn't matter. It's all right. How'd you do? I passed. I'm a lifesaver now. Thomas, come on! We're going to have a barbecue. Betsy said I could have steak. Hurry up, Tom. Not supposed to call him Tom. I'm allowed. You are? Always so far away. How can I get to him? It's easy. All he wants is a hug. No. That's not all. He's been talking about it all week. When he was little, you'd squeeze him so hard he couldn't breathe. He said, "I bet dad'll do it when he comes to pick us up... on Friday." When your mother and I split up, She said, "Don't lose the children." Didn't mean much at the time. She was right. Who said I'd let you eat a steak? I thought I could get that by you. Hey, sport. Look what I found. This is pretty neat. [together] What is it? Keep it. Yeah, thanks. It was nice talking to you, finally. Mmm, me, too. She was sitting behind me. This incredible perfume. I'd been in jail nearly two years with 400 sweating males. She got off the train, and I followed her. That's how good she is. She listened to a bum who followed her off the train. I guess I'm lucky with women. [chuckles] I should say. Mom, Anna... You. Well, I might not be such a pushover. Yeah? No, it's mostly roses. The azaleas go all the way around the outside. $12 each? Make it 32. Two dozen. What are eight more roses going to do? Biggest basket you have. Must be delivered tonight. It says, "A lifetime of love from Stasia, Andros." Dad, your credit card. They need the credit card. Just get it. Hurry up. "Melanie, little Melanie, Alex, little Alex--" I thought he was taller. It's been a while. You're bigger. I guess so. He has gotten fat, though. Think of all the junk he must eat. Bet I could beat him at the front crawl now. So, with his family and warmed by the very thought of a fire he'd built for himself, the man seemed to feel something in his heart ease. What was it? He looked out on the world, the only one he would ever know, and wondered. Dad! Dad! The boat's stuck! It's filled with water! I can't move! Help! Help! Come on in, Thomas! That's not safe. I just found you. I don't want to lose you. Your mother would kill me. Throw me the rope. Throw it! That's one useless piece of rope. [laughing] Come on. Oh... Why does it always go so fast? Just when I'm ready to put the sun in, it's gone. Hurry up, dad. I'm still wet. Huh? She even gets angry at the sun. What chance do we have? I used to know how to do this. Oh, yeah? I was really good at this. Come on. That's the smell of civilization-- scorched meat. You can have a steak. I'll have a piece of chicken. Have some meat. O.K. I forgot that--how he eats, how dedicated he is. It's like his religion. Things I like. You used to hum while you ate, like everything was fine in the world. I forgot about that. It feels good. [humming] The weekend's turning out fine. Relax. I am. I will. Yeah. Hey, Thomas, look. There's old Mercury. Remember? We used to watch stars. You could name all the planets. You could recite them like in a poem. You'd sit up in that little window. You remember? No. And that's Saturn. Sorry. Glad you kept up with your astronomy. That's real good. I'm not into stargazing so much. At school, we're working on a computer model of a biosphere for deep space travel. Everything's going to be O.K. What do you mean, "going to be"? This is it. What? This is as good as it gets. This might be the best moment of your life. How much better do you want it? Not much. Enjoy it. Thanks for the tip. I will. But they say the universe might be like a piece of string with the ends in a knot, so infinity isn't really infinity. When did he become Einstein? Be quiet, Einstein. Come up here. Your dad wants to hug you to death. That's been a while. Wait till I finish my chicken. I'm almost done. You're amazing. You'll get used to it. Hey, Thomas, don't worry about infinity. Know what that is out there? A big black sheet with holes poked in it to let light through. That's the latest. That's what I heard. The whole universe is inside a speck of dust in a ball of fluff in the cuff of a pair of pants hanging over the back of a chair. That's not it. You know what it is really? The whole thing is actually stars, planets. Everything is on the skin of a bubble of milk that's about to pop. It's in a bowl of cornflakes that someone's about to eat. Skim milk. You don't get bubbles on skim milk. Don't be so logical. Don't be so unscientific. I finished my chicken. [Thomas giggling] Whoa! Don't squeeze him so hard he can't breathe. See? Come here. Sit down. I've got a better one. Well, we're all inside a speck of pollen stuck to the wing of a bee. That's good. The bee's sitting on a flower. Don't mention flowers, Betsy, please. O.k.? Sorry. It's all right.
