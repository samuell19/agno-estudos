[Reverend] I have been called apart by God, to lead mankind out of the chaos and evil that besieges him and bring him back to the Garden of Eden. I bring you the gift of love and with that gift, we shall transform the world. The word is the power. Love! [crowd] Love! [Reverend] Love of your fellow man! [crowd] Love! [Reverend] Love! [crowd] Love! -[Reverend] Love! -[crowd] Love! [Reverend] Love! -[crowd] Love! -[Reverend] Love!

And love of your Reverend... who will lead you out of the darkness... into the light. Strive... that you... may enter the palace... of celestial tranquility. [applause] [cheering] Bless you, Reverend! Lead us! Lead us! [crowd] Lead us! Lead us! Lead us! Lead us! Lead us! This then, is our failed assassin. You are fearful, but I know you feel no pain. The needles have been inserted only to a point above the nerve center. If I press in this manner... So now you understand the nature of your problem. I'll only ask a couple of questions. You needn't be here long. Who hired you to kill me? [gasps] I'll let up, so you can answer if you wish. S... St... [Reverend] Stark? -Sta-- Stark. William Stark. True? [Reverend] Loosen the belts That wasn't so bad. Please leave by the door you are facing. By the way... What did star pay you for your troubles? 10 thousand. So little. Insulting. [karate yell] [groans] [door looks] [Reverend] Stark keeps pressing... and pushing. We should have taken more than his legs. Find him, Carl. Sue... Sue. Damn! Shit! No! [screams] [screams] Stay there, Bob. [doorbell] Hello, I'm Mr. Becker. I have an appointment with Mr. Martin. Yes, you're just in time. Mr. Martin's out back. [Becker] Stark isn't with you? [Jim] He's coming along in the van. Join me for breakfast. I'd love to. [Jim] My students make me breakfast every morning. But first we have to get there. [Becker] Oh... -Morning. -Good morning, sir. [Becker screams] [Michael screams] [Jim] Fine, Michael. [Michael groans] [Becker] Actually... a cup of coffee back at the house, would be sufficient. Everybody should start the day off with a good breakfast. -Care to lead. -Ah... Huh-uh. [Becker screams] [karate yell] -[karate yell] -[student groans] Hurry, hurry! I can't take it! [karate yell] Up. [whines] Fills the appetite, Becker. [Becker] Well... Well, that wasn't so bad. No, no. -See, here we are. -[chuckles] Good, good. Ah! I don't know how you did it. Whatever got you through that. -I was hungry. -Oh. Come on, sit. Eh! [Jim] Mr. Stark. Hello, Jim. How you doing? I'd get up, but as you can see things have changed. I never thought I'd see you tie down. All that energy... he was practically a father to me back in college. I heard. How did you ever get so tacky, Becker? Breakfast. Get right into it. You've heard of Reverend Rhee? From time to time. Reverend Rhee is the leader of a worldwide church with a very large following of dedicated young people. I thought it was more of a cult. That's closer to the truth. Hank... run that first piece of tape, please This island is owned completely by Rhee, and his group, and out from under the jurisdiction of any government. But he doesn't want any incident to occur, that could be used as an excuse for any foreign government to move in on them. Like the Marines. [Stark] Yes. Most of these young people are from wealthy families. To join Rhee's church, they must relinquish all their worldly goods. Sign away their inheritances. The head of a bull? Taurus is used as a symbol by Rhee, to represent strength, purity, and courage. This building intrigues us. It's very heavily guarded and called the Palace of Celestial Tranquility. To be allowed to enter it seems to be the ultimate attainment for these young converts. As you can see the newsmen couldn't get too close. [Jim] Anthony Lester chairman of the board IGT, great family wealth. [Stark] Exactly... and the young girl is his daughter Cindy. College had become a silly exercise. She quit school soon after and joined Rhee's organization on the island. [Reverend] Once you reach the state of grace, where your own live and thoughts are totally subordinate to that of God... you will join me in the palace for a life so sublime and peaceful, that you will never want to return to the ugliness of the lives you have known. Every time he speaks it's like someone just turned a light on in my head. Yes. I really got into what he said about material possessions and how they burden us all. That's my father, all he knows is money. We got so much we don't even know what to do with it. Sue made it to the palace. Yes. She said she'll get word back to me about it. I bet she's forgotten, Cindy. We've got a chance too. We'll be called one day. [Jim] Buster wants her back. [Stark] Yes. We planted an assassin on the island to kill Rhee. I haven't heard from him. I presume he's dead. I caught Rhee's attention. Several of his... men caught me off guard... broke up my legs a bit... don't work the same anymore. Christ! Came off better than most. I'm in this with you. How many men do you need? Rhee's personal guard numbers about 50. Five very special people. Yeah. Hey, you were born to wear it. Well, what do you think Mary? Maybe. Billy Ortega? Over there. Telegram. -No buttons on it... -[Mary] Oh, no. Doesn't do much for you Ralph. Well, stuff it up you pachata. What was that? -Did he say what I think he said? -Are you nuts? Se√±or... Well, here. You stuff it up in your bachaga. Now what do you want? The old man told ya... stay away from his daughter. I haven't gone to see her. She keeps showing up. I told her, it's over. Very sweet girl... The old man don't want no spic like you fooling around. I told you how it is. I know, Billy. But I guess we gotta fix a thing or two, so she don't have anything to come see. [karate yell] [groans] [moans] [karate yell] [screams] [motorcycle engine running] Glad to called, Jim. I got this number out of your girlfriend. What the hell is all that noise? There's some folks that wanna talk with me. [Jim] Well, tell them to hold down the racket. [Lockjaw] I'll try. I've got something for you. Can you be here tomorrow? Lockjaw? OK. But if I don't make it by tomorrow, forget it. [groans] [groans] [screams] [groans] [screams] [groans] [screams] Wup! Well... That's kinda the way it worked out. You're... sitting on my money, fella. Keeping the warm. Ah... Yeah, but it worries me... maybe your fat ass is sucking it up and gone. There was another hustler that took me, once... he talked quick like you. Got away, huh? Mostly... but... I've got two inches of his tongue, in a quart jar of alcohol, back at the shop. [everyone laughs] I'll tell you, boys, something... when I win... I laugh... when I lose... I cry... but one way or the other... the money always... changes hands. [karate yell] [groans] [screams] [groans] Where's my money? I don't like being cheat on! What the hell? Looking good. Good evening, Fred. [toucan croaks] [croaks] [croaks] [Laurie] You were clever enough to get in here. I'll forget about it if you clear out now. [toucan croaks] [toucan croaks] Ah... OK. OK. Hey, it's me. Of course it's you. [groans] That elbow in the stomach. That was lucky. Like hell it was. When did you figure it's me? Hmm... Well the hairstyle is different, but... I always know it's you. I still remember New Years of Miami. Two years. We've been wasteful. You were testing me, weren't you? [snorts] You thought I've lost my stuff. That was dumb of me. [chuckles] I heard you'd contacted some of the team. I figured you'd show up. [moans] What I need is a woman who can think and fight, and chew gum at the same time. [chuckles] And you're the boss? That's it. Well... I won't say sir. [croaks] [Stark] It's been the longest day, Hank. Take tomorrow off. [Hank] Yes, sir. [Stark] Ah! Let me help you. [Stark screams] [Hank] Ah! [groans] [Stark groans] I'm here for a name. Who's back? Am I to believe that's all you want for me? Just the name. You fucking cripple. Telling you won't save me, you bastard. [groans] [whistles] [engine start] [groans] Make a wish. [Stark screams] [Jim] It's usually the kids from affluent families that are listed in brainwashed all in the name of God. He's just milking their desire to be a part of something big. And when they're dry? Nobody's sure. And Mr. Lester is a very large contributor to Senator Forrester. So he's prevailed upon the senator to make an investigation. Now, we could hardly refuse a request from an American senator. He doesn't want to appear to be hiding anything. How come you know so much about that? I was briefed last night. It slipped. [Jim] Well, I see we're all here, except for Willard. He's psycho. He's all right. I like him, we laugh a lot, me and him. When will he be here? We'll pick him up. He's in prison. You mean, we have to get him out? Christ! It'll give us a chance to work together as a team, before we have to take on Rhee's Island. He's in a federal prison in Ecuador. Apparently, he got caught on the wrong side of a political turnaround. Willard could lose it for all of us. We need a good chopper pilot. I admit that emotionally, he could be a little unpredictable. -And-- -[phone rings] -Martin. -[Jim] Yes. Mr. Stark is dead. He's been murdered. Rhee? We can assume so. [Jim] Will we go ahead? Please. Please. Looks like 18 to me. [men speaking in Spanish] What? [groans] [karate yell] [karate yell] [Jim] From the main gate, cell-block six is to the rear, on the right side. I think we're almost there. [speaks in Spanish] FEDERAL PRISON [guards speaking in Spanish] [hustle and bustle] BLOCK OF MADMEN [screams] [Lockjaw] Jim, look out! [hustle and bustle] [hustle and bustle] [screams] [screams] [karate yell] [screams] [Ezekiel] Hurry! Willard isn't worth it. Shit! Alright, you wanna bet. It's open. Come in. Willard! Hey! Martin? I'll be dead. Laurie? Alright, we're getting you out of this place. Oh. And we got to get out of here fast. No, you have to. Why would I? Hey, compadre! Hey, Billy-O. How you doing? -You old wetback. -Oh, not since Panama City. Well... brother Ezekiel. Shit! Lockjaw! We don't have time, Willard. Wait a minute, is this rescue mission for your benefit of mine? Both, we have a project. Well... don't we go? You undoubtedly ruined it for me here. -What's the best way out? -Ah, ah, ah. The best way. It's this way. The Commandant's daughter. Nina. Nina, darling. Nina. Nina. I have to go with these people. It'll be very bad if I don't. What is worse... they have to use you as hostage. You do that for me? They'll help me. They told me that Nina, it's gonna be left unharmed, at the river. I'll be right back, Daddy. Hey! Let's not push it, alright? Willard... all we want to do is get out of here. It went well? Your trip to San Francisco? We found Stark alright. But I didn't get a name. Why is that? Oh, that idiot... he refused to tell me. Unusual... did you get impatient? Maybe I did. After he said, it didn't matter if he told me or not. And then it didn't matter. Senator Forester will arrive this Sunday. We'll want to clean up any loose ends before then. Hi. Still happy here? Oh, yes. I think more than ever. Why do you ask? You testing me? No, just interested. I'm a natural sniff. What about Reverend Rhee? [John] What do you think of him now? [Cindy] I think, he's what the world needs. Don't you? Absolutely. I'm glad to hear that your convictions haven't changed. Oh, if anything they've gotten stronger. Have you heard from sue? Not a word. It's really not like her. And you've turned over your inheritance Soon... and I'll be happy to get rid of it. All I ever heard at home was money. -Did your father approve? -Hardly. But then, I don't approve of my father. -You are testing me. -Not so. Your convictions are a rock and I know better than to... try to stick pins in a rock. Go with God. And you, John. [helicopter whirring] The closer we get, the more I think about it, the less I like it. We'll soon have proof enough, Senator. It better be indisputable and overwhelming. Freedom of religion is a very touchy subject. I don't intend to be caught on the wrong side of that. Ha! I wouldn't even be here, if old man Lester hadn't put on the pressure. I always thought his daughter was rather flighty. Yoga and all that shit. My new name is Bob Jinx. Yes, Jinx. Yeah, yeah. [helicopter whirring] Girls. [Senator laughs] [Senator] Well... Hello, hello. Well, thank you, thank you. Thank you very much. Well, is that charming? Thank you, thank you. -Well, you all look so wonderful. -Senator! You're welcome, Senator. You honor us. Delightful. Thank you, thank you. -Let's go ahead. -Oh, well yes, yes. I was just commenting as we're flying over how beautiful an island you have here. -[Jim] I think you look very good. -[Willard] You got it. [Carl] You have to leave, now. [Willard] Oh, right. Just a minute. Yes, sir. Sir. We'll be back in two days. Arts and crafts. Oh, yeah. Very nice, very nice, Beautiful here. [explosion] What do you suppose the trouble is? [helicopter whirring] That was lucky. Yes. We'll wait word on that. [Carl] What the hell is going on here? [Willard] I've got an electrical fire here, I don't know what caused it. Let me introduce you to my aides: Laurie Brand, Je--Jakes... Bob Jakes. And Ezekiel Thomson. [Reverend] Ezekiel is a fine biblical name. If I had a son... I would call him Ezekiel. They claim electrical fire, Reverend. [Reverend] I see. We are not prepared for anyone but yourselves. They will have to stay with their machine. Assigned a few men to help them with anything they need. I'm sure you'll want to see some of the work, these young people are doing. While they are preparing for God's calling. Now we're here to learn, Reverend. [Senator] Nice. Very nice, Reverend. That fella's coming back. Christ! Well, it's in here somewhere. It's going on bad. [Senator] Oh... Beautiful. Reverent... what's the building behind the iron fence? [Reverend] That's a temple sacred to our religion. Only a few, who have attained a state of grace may enter. It is a condition that all who come here strive for. We wouldn't be allowed in? I'm afraid not. It would be an act of profanity. I say this... without wishing to offend you. We understand. Well, I'm more in need of a bath now than edification. Fine. Ah, beautiful. Absolutely beautiful place. This way to the dormitory. [Senator] Fine, fine. Who was that man you recognized? John Stephens, he's a reporter from New York He's here to write an expose. Probably, I wonder if he understands the risk he's taken. [disciple] This way. Beautiful. [Carl] Reverent. You were right, sir. He's not what he claims to be? It's worse than that. Works for a newspaper in New York. Oh, my. Let's join the others. [crowd singing] ‚ô™ Onward, Christian soldiers ‚ô™ Marching as to war ‚ô™ With the cross of Jesus ‚ô™ Going on before ‚ô™ Christ, the royal Master I think you're mistaken about this people here, it's beautiful. ‚ô™ Forward into battle ‚ô™ See his banner go ‚ô™ Onward, Christian soldiers ‚ô™ Marching as to war ‚ô™ With the cross of Jesus ‚ô™ Going on before ‚ô™ At the sign of triumph - ‚ô™ Satan's host doth flee -Ah, here it is. - ‚ô™ On, then, Christian soldiers ‚ô™ -Welcome, Reverent Rhee. Wonderful, you people are magnificent. [Willard] Sounds like Reverent Rhee knows how to party. It's more prayer than party. You're happy here with the Reverend? He's the Messiah. I'm waiting for the day that... he perform his first miracle. You should be too. [Lockjaw] What? Oh... I am... I can't stand the suspense. [Billy] Amen. - Yeah? -Try to find Cindy. -OK. -She should be in one of the tents. And tell Ezekiel to stay here. I'm going to look around. OK. Uh! Look! What was that? Out back. [screams] Back here! [groans] [screams] [John groans] [John yells] [John groans] [screams] [John groans] [John groans] [John yells] It was a sound like somebody yelled. Well I didn't hear a thing. I'm not waiting around for it to happen again. Me neither, and I'm afraid I'm gonna step on something... slimy. Yes? Cindy, may me I speak to you? You're with that senator, aren't you? That's why you know my name. I came with him, yes. Are you afraid to be seen with me? Of course not. We're free to do as we wish. There are no restrictions here or guilt. There are people who think differently, you know? We all know you're here to try to pin something on the Reverend. All great men are subjected to ridicule. And a man like the Reverend happens to be an easy target for character assassination. But he won't fight from the same gutter. All we're asking is that you widen your vision a little. Is everything perfect here? Do you have a question or two that have troubled you? That you've pushed aside because of your love for the Reverend? Have people disappeared without any explanation? Have you heard from any of the people that have left? A letter, maybe? Surely some of them were friends of yours. Everyone was gone from here. Has been admitted to the palace, or sent around the world on missionary work. Your questions are insulting. Cindy... have you signed over your trust fund? How do you know about that? Your father-- My father? Leave me alone! Do me a favor. Don't sign anything just yet. I'll do you a favor. If you leave right now, I won't tell anyone you've been here. There's little about you that we don't know. [screams] [whines] [Reverend] There was someone else out on the ground with you. No one. [groans] [whines] Who is he? I don't know. I can only believe that you were helped by someone you don't know. [panting] Let him up. [groans] [trotting hooves afar] Ah! Ah! [bull moos] [bull moos] [screams] Hey! We've got something here. [yells] [grunts] [karate yell] The four of you had every chance to distinguish yourselves against a single man last night. Each of you fail. Now... you must defend your right to live here among us. [yells] [groans] [yells] [crack] Thank you now, young man. [door closes] This is Reverend Rhee. With the great sadness. I must report, that someone last night, broke into the holy palace and caused extensive damage. This has never happened before. It is an insult to all of us. And a great personal affront to me. I wish to apologize to our distinguished guests for this embarrassment. If any one of you observed an unauthorized person out on the grounds last night. Please contact me, as quickly as possible. Reverend Rhee has asked to see you. Right now? Yes, in the palace. Wow. The Reverend is waiting. Yes. Where's John? He's always here in the morning. I don't know. Good luck, Cindy. Hey, Cindy! You've been asked into the temple? Yes. Reverend Rhee called for me. Bless you Cindy, bless you. Praise God. Praise the Lord! They've taken Cindy in to the palace. All right let's shop how know this, Ze. He coming up fast. [knocking at the door] Come in! [coughs] [whispering] Better lay off that for a while, Senator You may need to see clearly. As soon as you can. You better tell Rhee, you're gonna have to cut your visit short. Apologies and all. Somehow, I'll get Cindy down to the beach. By tricking her or kidnapping her. Well take off, then we land on the beach and pick her up. [whispering] It's madness. That's right off the top of my head right now. We have to improvise on that. I better get back and don't leave this room. I'll have to know where everybody is. [opens and closes door] This, then... is the day you've been waiting for. You seem nervous, Cindy. It's nothing. I just expected... high windows and all that. This is but an office to conduct church affairs. Mundane and efficient. The best part is yet to come. Here have the papers, that allows the church to handle your affairs. But also obligates the church to see to you welfare. Your lifelong needs. You shall never want for love, nor a home... this is your home. Yes? Nothing, Reverend. I'm happy to be a part of it. I'm glad you've asked me. There. Fine. Cindy... We will celebrated happily this evening. Your generosity is how to care in the eyes of the Lord. And this evening... I'll see you again. I'm sure you'll find your way out. Thank you, Reverend. I knew I'd seen Martin somewhere before. -I still can't remember. -Obviously. He can't leave. And the State Senator? There will be a helicopter crash, an explosion. All on bard dead. It will have to be staged here. Look, just sit here on your ass until somebody gives you the word. No word? Any word! Your job is to do it when you're told to do it. -You have to stay here. -What? -Back in the helicopter. -The senator-- Back! [sobbing] [laughing] Yes, oh, yes. I want to see the Reverend anyway. You see... I can no longer stay here. We have got to get going. I have got to get back to Washington. Fine, then you can say goodbye to Reverend Rhee. He's expecting you It's Carl, isn't it? Ah. Good man, Carl. Cindy, what happened? Cindy! [knocking] [knocking] John Stevens is dead. Cindy found him. Now we're going to get out of this place. Are you ready to go? Had enough? We've got to get people together. Lock the door for you me, will you? [locks door] [knocking at the door] Senator! [knocks] Nothing. He understood he was to stay here. Young man. Yes, sir. -We're looking for the Senator and-- -I can witness. I can testify The Senator was escort in to the palace. You'll see. He'll be converted. Glory. How many guards will with him? Guards? There were no guards. Disciples. Six, there must have been six, and Carl. All right, thank you. It'll be a grand day this day. Glory! We've blown a cover somewhere. Well Rhee must figure as long as he's got the Senator, he's got us . I've got to get in. Go down to the helicopter, Ezekiel hasn't come back yet, I don't know what that means but get everybody you can over that wall. -OK. -All right. Before we go, I want to have a little farewell drink with you to thank you. For the hospitality that you-- Oh, shit. I beg your pardon. We shouldn't have come down here to this mission, he's not gonna let us come back. We're all going back, the Senator has been taken and Martin's going over the wall. Well, there's only one way to do that. [karate yell] [karate yell] Hurry, let's take the sucker to Rhee's backyard. [groans] [karate yell] [helicopter whirring] [karate yell] Come here! [karate yell] Billy! [Ezekiel] We gotta get to the basement! Sanctified bastard! [karate yell] Thanks God for Black & Decker. [karate yell] [groans] [karate yell] [screams] [yells] Your guys are losing out there. [trotting hooves] Oh, shit! [Jim groans] [karate yell] [Jim panting] [karate yell] [helicopter whirring] [Senator] From adversity... from the very pier itself. That is where true character is formed... and each of you... and you'll face the tomorrow after that. And you'll face it with renewed determination, -to rebuild once again-- -[Jim] Senator! -Come on! Come on! -even the ashes-- What the hell are you doing? I want to encourage this youth! Sorry, kids! Take it easy! -[applause] -Up with it! I had 20 more minutes. I had them right on my hand. What's the hurry?
