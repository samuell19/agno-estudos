[Theme music] [Grand music] [Tense music] [Horse snorts] [Gun cocks] [Neighing] [Thumps] [Thuds] [Baby crying] [Gunshot] [Speaking foreign language] [Speaking foreign language] What tribe are you with? Where are they from? [Speaking foreign language] Where are you from?! [Speaking foreign language] Could be up from Mexico. Where are the rest of their men? Odds are, about a day's ride ahead, looking for food and a place to hide. I'd put one of them on a horse and have him tell the tribe they have to come to San Carlos if they want to see these people again. Sergeant rudabaugh, I want to move out. [Sgt. Rudabaugh] Yes, sir. You heard the man! Thompson, bring those horses up here! Collins, get these people lined up. Men together. Women and children together. Let's move it! Foothills by sundown, sergeant. - Yes, sir. - [Woman] Mister... For the love of god! Who are you? What's your name? Do you have a name? Oh, Nick. Nick! Come on up here! Get her name. Some kind of name. [Speaking foreign language] You can talk to me. Do you speak English? What is your name? Sarah. Sarah. That's fine. Your name is Sarah. Carver. Sarah carver. When were you captured? Long... time. Were there any survivors? All... dead. It's over now. Do you understand? It's all over now. Come along. Buck, bring that horse up here. Hurry! [Speaking foreign language] Let's go. Come on! Carver party. Outside lemmington... About 10 years ago. Found a man, a woman, and three young boys. I wonder what she went through all those years. [Man] All right, everybody, move out! You sure picked a hell of a way to end 15 years with the army. I don't mind getting out alive. Ho! Sergeant rudabaugh, you take over. Forward! [Tense music] - Apaches? - Yeah. - How many? - Just one. But there were three men. They were all armed. One set of tracks and a buffalo rifle. Salvaje. I thought he was in Mexico. He was here... Not more than a few hours ago. [Sgt. Rudabaugh] The last I heard of salvaje, he was clear down to window rock. [Commander] What the hell is he doing up here again? He took on 10 troopers down there, killed four of them, and not a one of them got a look at him. Let's Bury those people. Get moving. [Commander] Sergeant rudabaugh, form a burial detail. [Sgt. Rudabaugh] Collins, foster, burial detail. - [Man 1] What the hell's going on? - [Man 2] What's happening? [Sgt. Rudabaugh] Salvaje, that's what. Let's move! [Hoofbeats approaching] Hey, collie. - Look after him. - Pulling out in the morning. Open up! Clear the way! We must go now. I must go. My dear woman, just be thankful you're alive. We cannot stay here. Of course she'll go! She's not staying here! You won't be staying here. [Doctor] She wants to go now. [Man] Today? Yes. Please. [Man] I can't give you an escort today. Sam! And if I could, where would you go? Do you have a place to go? [Doctor] Where do you come from? [Carver] Columbus. Would you still have people there? Yes. [Man] Well, either way, there's no sense in going today. You and your boy should rest now. Get some food in you. [Doctor] You're wasting your time. What do you mean "I'm wasting my time"? She insisted upon seeing you because she wants to leave here, not because she wants to be fed. We've been all through that. Well, she's not leaving. Sorry, I can't give you an escort out of here for another five days. If I could, I'd have you on your way right now. The only person who will be leaving here is Mr. Varner... In the morning. And if I can, I'll keep Mr. Varner from leaving, too. Now, you go on back to your tent. We'll give you an escort to silverton by the end of the week. You can contact government agencies. They'll take good care of you. Toomey, escort this lady and the boy back to the tent. Yes, sir. God only knows what's going on in that poor woman's mind. Going. Where is she gonna go? You know, you're not gonna know how to live out there any more than that woman will. Well, what the hell is so important out there anyway? After 15 years. One more year, that's all I ask. That's all you asked last year. That's all I'll ask next year. I'm short of good men. I need you, Sam. You've got Nick. No. Nick's a breed. - He's good. - He's a breed, Sam. If he wants to move on, he'll move on. He's here because you took him in. If he cares about anything, it's not about this army. Not this year, major. I got a place to go to, and I'm going. Thank you for the whiskey. Place to go to. [Sgt. Rudabaugh] Thought you was leaving. Sunrise. Seen Nick? Not here. - Buy you a whiskey? - No thanks. Your breed ain't too happy about you leaving, yo know? Well, he'll get used to it. Time he was on his own. I try to win you a little money. I figure I'll buy you cow for your farm. Ranch. Yeah, ranch. There goes your cow. Come on. I'll buy you a drink. [Chuckles] Come on. I got a drink. Maybe someday I show up. You teach me grow onions, huh? You want to grow onions, you know where to find me. [Thuds] You teach me everything so good, huh? I'll do it again. I got to draw blood, huh? Be a big waste of 10 years, wouldn't it? [Whispering] Mister. Yes, ma'am? Are you going to silverton? No, ma'am. I'm not going to silverton. You can take us. I'm not going to silverton, ma'am. The major said. Oh, well, he said I was leaving in the morning, but I'm not going to silverton. We have to go. Well, you get an escort to silverton in five days. Too late. Well, I'm sorry, ma'am. Please. I'm going to new Mexico. I don't go by way of silverton. The army will take good care of you. You don't have to be afraid anymore. Good night, ma'am. Please. [Solemn music] [Whispering] Please. Tell the major that the lady and her boy will be needing a transportation voucher. Take you to hennessy, ma'am. You can get the stage for silverton from there. As far as I'll take you. [Steady music] [Clanging] [Clanging] Silverton stage? Day after tomorrow. We can use some rest. Julio, ven acá. [Wind howls] [Clears throat] Well, we're going to silverton together? Those of us who are going. I sent my family back to Wichita. That's where I'm heading. [Laughs] You know, this man in hopperville has real strong hope for this territory. Why, just the other day, he says, "Lee, now, if you wait it through, you can bring your family back. [Laughs] "Sooner or later, we're going to run all the Indians out," he says. [Laughing] [Wind howls] Ashki! Ashki! Ashki! [Man] He took my knife. Tried to kill me. Ashki! What's the trouble? Ashki! Ashki! My boy. He's gone! Bring out my horse. [Wind howls] [Neighing] [Tense music] [Neighing] [Neighing] [Neighing] [Neighing] [Ominous music] [Creaking] [Cocks gun] Never... seen... Nothing... Like him. Salvaje. [Music continues] [Scraping] He'll come back. Not here. We should go now. He'll come. We're not going anywhere. He's finished here. He did what he came to do. He is not finished. He came for his son! He'll come back for his son! [Thwacks] You pulled us out here knowing all the time he'd come after us? I thought he would not get to us in time. Five days! You couldn't wait for five days? You could have had an army escort in five days. Is that worth five days? He will come back. We cannot stop. Well, we've stopped. Whoa. Where's the mex? What's going on? He's dead. They're all dead. Salvaje. Nobody leave the wagon. We're moving out. These people are going to silverton. Government travel papers. All right. All right. Put them on. Hurry it up! Just show this to the stationmaster at silverton. You riding with us, mister? Sure feel better if somebody was riding behind us. I'd appreciate it. Hah! [Upbeat music] Whoa. Changing horses! 15 minutes! Much obliged. Depot. Train comes in over there. Come on. We'll get your tickets. Columbus? You said you wanted to go to Columbus. I don't know. Well, you said you had family in Columbus. My... family is dead. Well, must be somebody left there... Friends, somebody. All right. Columbus. I'm afraid this won't take them to Columbus. This voucher can't cross them into Ohio on the revel line. And there would be a change in Kansas City to the revel line. Get them to Topeka. Uh... what about Topeka? You want to go to Topeka? It's far. It's in Kansas. All right. Topeka. Two? The lady and the boy. Train should be here sometime about 2:00 or 3:00. It'll take them as far as taspola. They'll have to change there and wait on for a train to gallup. Shouldn't be more than a few hours. Then they can ride this ticket through to dodge city. God willing. Then just wait till Tuesday. Then they can just take the bdr&o right on through to Topeka. Could you get along without that shoe box? Well, I figure I can travel some before sunset. Much good luck. Thank you. [Neighing] He buried them. He can tell you more than I can. All right, Ollie, get that team ready, and get the passengers on. We're moving out. [Man] Ready to go, Shelby. You buried them, huh? We're all out of beer. All out of ice. Got some coffee, and there's still some cereal left on the stove if you want. Coffee. [Man] Ready to go, Shelby. Giddyap! A hell of a way to live... Driving a stage. Can you cook? I got a parcel of land in new Mexico. Uh... Bought it through the mail. Only seen it once. For the last eight years, I've been sending money down there to an old man who's supposed to be buying cattle for me. It's not much of a house, but a... place to live in. The old man and me would probably get more work done if we had somebody to cook for us. It might be better for the boy than the city. You might not like it. I never lived with anybody in my life. But I've agreed with myself that you're welcome to come, if you want to. I have to sell my horse. [Slow music] [Engine chugging] [Train whistle blows] [Steady music] [Grand music] Buenas tardes. Buenas tardes. - Buen día. - Sí, buen día. [Cow mooing] [Metal squeaking] There's a pump around the side. [Slow, bright music] [Dog barks] [Dog whimpers] Hear you had a bad winter. Lose many cattle? It was a bad winter. Near kill them all last winter. [Dog whimpering] Come on, boy. Come on. [Grand music] Now, I know that uh, we agreed that uh, you'd come down here and do the cooking, and I appreciate it, but I can't say I'm real happy about the way you stand around the room. Now come on, sit down at the table, both of you. Come on. Come on. With food on your plates. Now, from now on, we'll be taking our meals together. I got nothing against talking. I don't mind a little talking now and then. Anybody feels like saying anything, well, just ought to say it, you know, uh, anything. Pass the peas. Pass the meat. Just whatever you want to say, you just speak up. Speak up. Pass the meat. And give me the salt. Tell that to the boy. Go on. Tell him if he wants some peas, he ought to say, "pass the peas." Let's get this thing settled. [Speaking foreign language] What's the boy's name? He wasn't given his name yet. Well, let's give him one now. What would you like to call him? What was your father's name? Thomas. Good. Good. You want to call him "Thomas"? He wouldn't understand. There is already too much for him to understand. You, uh... Anybody wants to say anything, well, just go right ahead and say it. Pass the peas. Pass the salt. Whatever you want passed. It's... It's not easy... For me to talk. It's... been a long time... Since I have talked. But I would like to say this... That it pleases me... To be here. And I think... it is a beautiful place to be. It's not much, but it's better than sand. Plenty of blankets and uh, more firewood just outside. I want you to know that you're free here. You can come and go as you please. There's a view from that north Ridge... Sometimes I think you can see all the way back to Arizona. Good night, miss carver. [Door shuts] Good night. [Solemn music] [Music swells] [Slow, grand music] [Music quickens] [Solemn music] [Thunder rumbles] [Rain falling] [Thunder rumbles] [Tense music] [Horse snorting] Yeah, I think Sam varner make you better scout by now, boy. [Speaking foreign language] [Horse snorting] [Chuckling] Ah, you son-of-a-gun, you picked me up, huh? I spotted you from the Ridge about four miles back. I tell you the truth, varner, I figure I find you dead over some onion patch, huh? I listen at the fort. I hear from the Indians about the boy. You know what he is, this boy? Yeah. Oh. Well, I figure maybe you don't know. So I ride hennessy. I dig up that grave, hennessy. I figure maybe you're in it. Goodbye, Sam, huh? Then, I ride silverton. Silverton, they're all dead, too. Even your horse dead, silverton. Then, I hear he stops wagon at oakley. Two days later, he's already Columbia pass. I figure it out. I come tell you. He's on his way. Figured good, huh? Real good. [Snorting] [Peaceful music] [Horse snorts] [Hoofbeats approaching] Nick will be here for a while. Salvaje is on his way. [Tense music] [Snorting] Have you told him anything? I think... He already knows. There's a Mexican family down the road. Ride over in the morning... warn them. [Suspenseful music] It has nothing to do with you. It has to do with me. I didn't have the courage to die. I knew what I had to do to stay alive. I chose to be with him. Tomorrow I'm going to take my boy away... And salvaje will find us, and maybe that will be enough for him. It won't be. It... Will keep him from here. What about after here? I buried his dead at hennessy. They're all dead at silverton. Dead all the way across Arizona. I have to think about that. If I can, I have to stop it. You and the boy aren't leaving here. I want you to stay here. It's right that you're here. [Solemn music] [Horse snorting] Hey, old man. You want to make card game? I teach you poker, huh? You talk too much, huh, Nick? Hey, boy. Hey, come here. [Speaking foreign language] Hey. [Speaking foreign language]. Come here! Come here! [Speaking foreign language] You going to be white, you better learn white man's game, huh? Yeah. [Shuffles deck] Pretty good, huh? Sit down. [Speaking foreign language] See this? That's cards, huh? See that? That's numbers. Numbers. All numbers, huh? Say this number. Four. Four. That's four. Say that. [Speaking foreign language] - Four. - Four! Attaboy. Say this one here. Say that one. Three. Three. [Speaking foreign language] - Three. - Three. Three. I teach you count, huh? Okay, say, "ace." "Ace." Ace. Deuce. Deuce. - Deuce. - Three. - Three. - [Speaking foreign language] Four. Four. Four. - Four. - Five. - Five. - Attaboy. You going to make good poker player. You want a cigar? You take cigar. Attaboy. [Suspenseful music] [Door shuts] [Cocks gun] [Bleating] [Snorting] [Banging] [Whinnying] [Banging] Where is she?! We didn't see nobody. She's gone. The breed's looking. Get inside. Bolt the doors and windows. [Door closes] Nick! I lose him! Someplace I lose him, damn it! [Splashing] [Tense music] Tell the boy she's not dead. [Speaking foreign language] [Somber music] Tomorrow morning. [Door opens] You all right? Yes. [Gun cocks] We have to start before the sun's out. [Suspenseful music] [Bird hoots] [Music continues] [Horse whinnies in distance] [Horse whinnies] He's doubled back! [Music intensifies] [Gunshot] [Whinnying] [Gunshot] [Gunshot] [Dog barking] [Gunshot] [Gunshots] [Speaking foreign language] [Yells in foreign language] [Gunshot] [Gunshots] Open up! [Somber music] [Whinnying] [Tense music] [Growling] [Fire crackling] I teach him poker. I teach him take your money. How come you never give me chance beat you, varner? Come on, I play you stud. Maybe you make him tough scout, huh? Maybe. Maybe this one don't want to be tough scout. Maybe not. Figure you beat the man, you win the breed, huh? I'll tell you something, varner. Maybe the man beats you. Maybe this half-breed, he'll be Indian. [Clanking] Feed my dog. [Tense music] Here, boy. Here. [Gasping] [Whispering] Ned. Ned. Ned! Ned! [Footsteps approach] [Whispering] Ned. Ned. [Screams in distance] [Suspenseful music] [Cracking] [Thuds] [Gunshots] [Cocks gun] I saw something. You find the old man? Yeah. [Door opens] [Door closes] [Suspenseful music] You won't hear him. I'll hear him. It doesn't happen that way. He just comes. I'll hear him. I'm going across the clearing. Head for the north side of the corral, into the trees. I want to draw his fire. If I don't, at least he'll be watching me. When I get to the middle of the clearing, I want you out the storeroom window. Our best bet's still having two of us on him. Keep well behind me. If I can keep his eye on me, he'll still think there's one of us in this house. Let him know when I'm halfway across. He's there! [Suspenseful music] [Music continues] [Music intensifies] [Gun cocks] - Sam! - [Gunshot] [Gunshot] [Gunshots] [Music fades] [Gunshot] [Gunshot] [Whinnying] [Gunshot] Hey, Sam. Yeah. [Somber music] [Thoughtful music] [Shuffling cards] [Music fades] [Clicking] [Creaking] [Slight noise] [Slight noise] [Clicking] [Blowing] [Slight noise] [Gunshots] [Tense music] [Tense music] He's hit! [Suspenseful music] [Music continues] [Gunshot] [Gunshots] [Gunshots continue] [Gunshot] [Gunshot] [Tense music] [Rustling] [Rustling] [Thunks] [Music intensifies] [Music continues] [Gunshots] [Breathing heavily] [Music fades] [Steady music] [Music swells]
