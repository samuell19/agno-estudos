Lie down with your head here, please. Don't worry, it won't hurt. Jean-Pierre... Understand what I just told you? Left temporal tumor. Inoperable. Sorry, I wanted to make sure you understood. Best-case scenario, can I make it with chemo? Yes. You'll need a replacement. Stop work to stand a chance of beating it. You have a spot. Of ink or coffee, here... 'tug mg! Let's get undressed. We'll take a look at you. I told you, Mr Gaucher. You should dress more simply when I come. - Hello, doctor. - Hello. What happened? I got stuck in the cattle locking yoke. I can't bend my hand. Turn the TV down. Whose are the blue and red trainers? Enzo's. Is he here? I can get him. Now the other. All right. Something wrong? No, nothing serious. I'd just like him to have a lumbar x-ray. There may be a slight imbalance. My trousers too? Don't piss me off! Get lost! 300 liters. Let me see... - They billed you for 500. - I know! Does your gauge work? I've no idea. Your dad always checked by putting a stick in the tank. Where's the stick? Your tank's full to the brim, Mum. It's the gauge that's not working. I know, I'm late. Santana... You need to realize you'll be living on 720 euros a month. - How much is your rent? - 455 euros. - How'll you manage? - No idea. You won't have much left over. Your employer may be able to help. You're entitled to wage benefit. I'm making no promises... I'll write a letter for the local social worker. All right. The lady's name is... Mrs... Le... bre... ton. Mrs Lebreton. You'll recognize the letters? No drawer sign... That doesn't hurt. That's it, right there. The interior meniscus. That's good. Two more centimetres. You're straightening up, gaining confidence. Good! Stop or I'll start blubbing like last week. Don't worry, I have plenty of tissues. Undress so I can examine you. We're going to make it. When you're in the midst of a depression and you think you're worthless, it's tough. You're doing well. You have projects, your driving test... You're looking to the future. The pills won't cure you. I know who'll pull you through. You will. Thank you, doctor. Good bye. Excuse me... I'm Nathalie Delezia. Come in. Have a seat. Good evening. Let's hurry. It's 8:30 and I just refused someone. So, what's the problem? Dr Norés didn't let you know? He said you need someone to work with you. - You're a doctor? - Yes. Ever worked in a country practice? No. - In town? - At a hospital. You've never done a replacement? I just graduated. Medicine is long, but you must have redone a few years. I started late. I was a nurse for ten years. Really? After my thesis, I worked at the Mantes ER in the meantime. In the meantime? Before moving to the country. Hospital's not my thing. Nores told you I needed someone? Did he say anything else? No... I know the area. I spent holidays at my father's place in Thorigny. Working here and spending holidays isn't the same thing. It's not? You're an idealist, hmm? If you say so. Country doctor isn't a trade you can learn. I'm here because of a headache. The pain began two weeks ago. I can't remember how. Fairly suddenly, I think. But in the evening, I'd... Is the pain there all day? - The morning mostly. - On waking. My head aches when I get up but... So mostly on waking. Is the pain on one side? Front or back? It depends. It's usually at the front but... At the front then. Mostly at the front. All right. I'll examine you. You're doing both the questions and answers. Wasn't she leading you, Nicolas? What were you about to say when she interrupted the first time? You said, "The pain began two weeks ago, I don't know how, but in the evening I'd..." I'd started the new treatment for my diabetes. I'll examine you. A doctor interrupts a patient every 22 seconds on average. The secret is to let them talk. 90% of the diagnosis is provided by the patient. - Can I put some music on? - No. Go on your own. What is it? Mr Jallet, I'm Dr Delezia. Where's Werner? In consultations. I'm doing his calls today. Can he come tomorrow? He trusts me, you know. He sent me here. I'd rather see the doctor. Quite frankly... I'm surprised. Jallet is usually a nice fellow. Really. Some people can be moody, but him... I don't understand. Try it alone again. I'll make a call and join you. What are those ducks? Yes, all right. What ducks? There! Didn't you see them attack me? They're not ducks, they're ganders, male geese. I got attacked once too. 22 stitches. You have to humiliate them. How do you mean? You stuff their beak up their ass. It humiliates them and they back off. The beak up the ass. - It's risky, but worth it. - I get it. What? Why are you giving me a hard time? Get lost, stop pissing me off! Get lost or I'll have you for dinner! That's my son's. He's studying architecture. He's on Von Leron's team. He did the Madrid opera. Know him? No. Medicine wasn't his thing? Being a doctor here is 24/7. That soon put him off. He followed his mother to Paris. Tomorrow, I can do house calls and you consultations. But I start at 7 tomorrow. If you want to come, you can. All right. See you tomorrow. Fanny, can you move the dog to let us in? I'm a nurse, not a vet. How is he today? He hasn't eaten much. I did the LMWH and took a blood sample for you. His temperature's up to 38°C. Gently. Turn. Sit down. Give me that... Do you feel all right? - Jean-Pierre? - Yes. How do you feel? This is Dr Delezia. She works with me. Hello, sir. He's not too hard on you? He is, but I'm tough. That's good. Never give up. That's not bad. It's not bad. Open wide, show me your tongue and that'll be all. Very good. Open your pretty eyes, I still feel that weight in my chest. Relax. Stay calm. Come on... Everything is fine. Hi, Guy. - How's it going? - Okay. He's the gloomiest man I've ever met. Never a smile. Each time they need someone to host a village event, he volunteers. - What do you think? - He's a bit... I meant the patient. What do you say? A nightmare. I see ten reasons to hospitalize him. He has peripheral arterial disease, untreated diabetes, a lung infection, an INR at 3.2... His CBEU shows a urinary infection... A new antibiogram would be a good idea. That's good. You know a lot. A few days in internal medicine would help us see more clearly. In theory, but not in this case. Why not? Because each time he comes back weaker. Worse after than before. So I've kept him here. It's what he wants, to stay in his home. So we believe and deal with it. If he gets septicemia, embolism or arrhythmia... Hospitalizing him would be much simpler. What do you think? - About? - Hospitalizing him. Why? We're doing a bad job? No. What do you think? - You want to hospitalize him? - I never said that. We've kept him two years thanks to Jean-Pierre. Don't change that. Let's make some room... It's good to see you. We're short of doctors around here. Everybody knows. Here's Francis. He'll say it too. Francis. I'm the mayor. How do you do. Nathalie Delezia. How are you doing? Enjoy your lunch. - Do you know the area? - A little. Her dad was from Thorigny. I have a health centre project. A real estate project. What'll you put in your health centre? A physiotherapist, a speech therapist, a nurse... I spoke to Fanny. She'll join it. They hate progress here. They live in the past. Things mustn't change. A new soccer pitch, they moan. Chop down two poor trees, they moan. Plant flowers to prettify the place, they moan too. Know Maroini's syndrome? No, I don't. - Really? - It doesn't ring a bell. You usually diagnose it by chance via a chronic intellectual deficiency. Get the idea? I have an interesting case to show you. Maroini's syndrome. Look it up online. With an I at the end? No, not at all. So how's it going? I'm getting my bearings. And with Jean-Pierre? Fine. Getting your bearings? Exactly. We told you before, you can always change your mind. I know. Thank you. Tell me, does Maroini's syndrome ring a bell? What syndrome? Maroini, with an I at the end. An intellectual deficiency. Intellectual deficiency... H! check and call you back. Take care. You too. Look at this. Not so bad. The platelet count is low. The white ones are okay. You need to rest. You can't keep on like this. Why did I send her to you? To piss me off. I didn't want anyone. Really, she's a great girl. A mature student, proving she has guts. She's a former nurse, perfect in an emergency. I do medicine, not emergencies. Why won't you let anyone help? Why not say you're ill? Who to? Your family, your mother, your son's mother, your friends. Nathalie too, instead of hassling her. As a doctor, she can understand. Let her consult and do house calls alone. Let her help you. It's early days. This will get much tougher. I don't feel so bad. Cut it out! Yes, everything's fine. I have all the names and addresses. Don't worry. All right. Yes, I'll call if there's a problem. And if I don't know, I'll call you. I'm entering Omerville. I have to go. You'll call me? Get in. Hi, this jerk's got a hook stuck in his thigh. Excuse me, I'm looking for Mrs Caillon's house at La Fare-Basse. Mrs Caillon? Head straight out of the village and follow the dirt track. I'll stuff your beak up your ass! Sorry. Say if it hurts. I'll try to be gentle. There we are. This will hurt a bit. I'll wet it. Tell me if it hurts, okay. - Does that hurt? - No... That's painful. Be careful. - I'll be gentle. - But it's okay. Shit! If the girl takes your place, you can take the butcher's. Shut your mouth. Where is she? She's fled already? She's doing house calls. On her own? Who's she's seeing? My mother. Shit... 21... 21428. That's it. 22075... 22... How much? Everything's fine. No worries. No, it's okay. Two more and I'll be back. All right. I have to go now. Bye. Are you hurt? I never saw him! I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. Call an ambulance. - Talk to me, young man. - I'm okay. - I'm not hurt. - Nowhere? I'm not hurt. Roll into the safety position. Don't move. How do you feel? - No signal... - Try over there! I'm not a grunt, I'm a clown! Don't try to move. You came off your bike. You're in shock. I'm a doctor, I'll take care of you. She thinks I'm a grunt! What happened? Mum... It's okay, I'm a doctor. He fell off his bike. An ambulance is coming. No, leave him. He's my son. - He's my son. - It's nothing. - What? - Nothing's good. - Where does it hurt? - Nowhere! He's okay. He was born this way. - It's okay. - She thought I was a grunt! No, She didn't think you were a grunt. Well? Fine. Fine fine? Really fine. No real difficulties? No. And you? No worries then? No. Yes... A couple of Maroini's syndromes. Med school jokes... Haven't you outgrown them? Ever read this? Bulgakov's "A Young Doctor's Notebook". A present for you. - A young doctor... - With a lot to learn? Exactly. Thank you. Do you smell burning? No. I must have left something on the stove. Dr Delezia... All right. On the Magny road? Absolutely. I'm on my way. An emergency at the gypsy camp. You haven't finished eating. I have. What? It's dark there at night. You thought I'd let you go alone? Good evening. Dr Werner. Dr Delezia. It's this way. It's Mum, she's really not well. My colleague will see her. Go on, Delezia. Go on. She's been in bed for three days. She's really not well. She won't eat, she had a drop of water today. Good evening, madam. I'm going to manipulate you. Where does it hurt? Here? Let me see if your neck's stiff. Any vomiting? No? No fever either? No, it doesn't feel like it. Could I have a teaspoon? Give me the spoon. Stick out your tongue... Thank you. I'll manipulate you here... Breathe normally. Does your arm hurt? All the way down to the hand? Grip mine. All right. Cervicobrachial pain syndrome. - Is it serious? - No, painful, but not serious. All right. I'll give her an anti-inflammatory shot. - She's scared of shots. - Yes, shots... - Let the doctor work. - Okay. Go ahead, madam. It won't hurt. Keep still, Mum. Don't move. Here we go. That's it, nearly done. There. She'll be okay, doctor? She'll soon feel much better. - Thank you, doctor. - You're welcome. In Lagny. In Lagny, opposite the cinema. We'd like to see you, if possible. - All of you? - Yes. We all wanted to see you. Really? I'm flattered. Especially the kids. They're not well. It must be a stomach bug or maybe flu... - Thank you. - How's the grandmother? She's very well. - Did she sleep well? - Yes, we're pleased. A new file for each patient we just saw? Yes. Why not? Ever thought about a computer? What for? To save time maybe. To save time? Entering data is quicker? Finding it takes 20 seconds. - Give me a name at random. - What? Any patient's name. Poinard. Poinard... Hold on a second. We saw him yesterday. A tougher one now. The file... for Mr Bardat. Bardat... 1, 2, 3... 4, 5, 6... 7, 8, 9, 10, 11... Bardat! Great! Another idea? The file for... Nathalie Delezia. Very funny. The Board keeps asking for a medical certificate. So see a colleague. I've been too busy. It's a formality. Just sign it. I don't do bogus certificates. You could be hiding an illness. Come on. No, really. - Seriously? - Yes. Examine me then. I'll take your blood pressure, then. 120170. Are you on the pill? Yes. - Do you smoke? - Yes. Any medical history? No. Any allergies? - I undress? - Yes. It's all right. Lift your shirt a bit. Breathe a little deeper. That'll do. Very good. Fit for duty. We're done. Hi, it's Dad. How are you? - Everything okay, sir? - Yes. You manage to rest between sessions? We're going to begin. It's this pouch here, okay. It'll take about two hours. Call me if you don't feel well. Don't hesitate. I won't be far. - Thank you. - See you later. Sorry, I have to take a look. Your friend may have passed on her genital warts. They come and go. It can be an old infection, like herpes. Can you lie down? I thought it'd be Dr Werner. I'm used to this. She's seen others. Go on. It'll be okay. Can you lower your boxers? Here we go. It's a genital wart all right. You hear that? I heard! I already said sorry! - Can I get dressed? - Yes. What do you want? What are you doing? I'm watching a film. You watch TV standing up now? I might doze off if I sit down. You can sit down if you want. No, I'm okay. Stop staring at me. Don't you have work to do? I love you. - It's your first pregnancy? - Yes. My boyfriend heard about a girl whose baby died. She had it in the car 'cos the hospital was too far. We're not going to abandon you. Give me that. Lie down. Magny has closed down. I'll have to go to Gisors, another hour away. I know. For now, Dr Werner and I will take care of you and we won't let you go to give birth all alone. I hope I'll be up to it. Of course you will be. It's normal being afraid. You can ask me anything you want. Can you put crosses on the circles? That's the lot? Yes. Minor hemisphere syndrome. You can't perceive the left side. What can we do? Continue the chemo. Let's hope the tumor shrinks, so the syndrome will vanish. The other day, I smelled burning. I was working with Nathalie. I ran to the kitchen. There was nothing at all on the stove. You have to tell her. I know. I'll do it. I'll do it. His breathing's bad. Show me your hands. Let's see your legs. Can you help, Fanny? I'm going to look at your calves. Tell me if I'm hurting you. Am I hurting you, Mr Sorlin? How does that feel? And here... Hold on, this leg now. What are you saying? He wants Jean-Pierre. He's not answering. Embolism is bad. He needs antibiotics by IV. Maybe anticoagulants too. I'm warning you, I can't take the dog. Right, we hospitalize him. Nathalie... I need a word. Why's he here? You hospitalized him? Yes. What did I say? I tried calling. He was in pain. He needed treatment at home. He had phlebitis, a fever, chest pains... - I feared embolism. - So? I had to hospitalize him. - Don't come back. You're done. - What? Give me back everything! - You can't! - I promised him! He was in pain, with a risk of embolism. He's 92, he's exhausted. Know what the hospital's like? I'll tell you. He'll wait for hours on a stretcher in the ER. They won't know what to do with him because he's confused. A 92-year-old patient is always confused in hospital! They'll give him a feeding tube and stop him from ripping it out! If he does have a massive embolism, they'll do nothing. Why? Because you don't resuscitate a confused 92-year-old! He'll die in internal medicine, far from his family! It isn't as black as you paint it. Yes, if we're more positive, maybe he won't die. They'll send him home weaker and worse than when he went in. I asked you not to hospitalize him whatever happened. Hold on, I don't understand. What? No, calm down. Calm down, I don't understand. Where? Jean-Pierre! Over here! The grinder slipped and hit me. You need stitches, but I can't do it here. Nathalie? It's Jean-Pierre. I'm on Maroini's work site. He's severed his femoral, it's pissing blood. Yes, I understand. Call an ambulance. I'll be there first. All right. Tell me that calmly. The narrow road after the final street lamp. Yes... After 500 metres, the "work site" sign... He's in hypothermia, with a thready pulse. I'll put him on a drip. - Where's the ambulance? - On its way. Let me take over. Perfect. Slide the machine along. It's heavy. Pull it towards you now. Now lower it. There. Switch on the test light. There. Cover the whole plate. The ankle... has to be at the centre of it. There. Perfect. The marker on the other side. There. Okay, let's go. Put on your protective gear! You see the gauge? Put 50 kilos, 15 BMI. 50 kilos, 15 BMI. That's it? Ready. All right then. Let's go. Don't move. Perfect. I think I bashed my collarbone too. There. - Is it ready? - No. A few more seconds. Let me see. Higher. A bit longer. You did a great job earlier. That should do. Let it drain... There. Put it on the line. A sprain, nothing broken. And my collarbone? Well? I'm looking. - Well? - Everything's fine. - Need a hand? - I'm okay. The tumor seems confined but there are spots on the right lung. We began chemotherapy five weeks ago. Will he pull through? It's hard to say. It's fifty-fifty, maybe better. Why didn't you tell me? Doctor-patient confidentiality. That's the easy way out! What do I do now? Keep learning your job. That's the best thing, for you and for him. And if I tell him I know? Thanks. See you. I couldn't work here. How do you do it? Normal. Something's in bold print there. It's nothing important. So why is it in bold? It's outside the lab's norms, but means nothing. It's just a bit high. I don't understand. Is it within the norm or not? It's not within the norm, but it's unimportant. For you, it's not serious. Why measure it in that case? I work from a global view, not individual results. So you take useless measurements? Yes, exactly. Sit down and I'll check your blood pressure. Again? What use is that? - It's a key constant. - I know that. Well? What is it? 110/70, perfect. Sit down. I came for nothing. Are you fully qualified? No. I studied one year, then learned on the job. 23 euros. Cheque or cash? It's me. Jean-Pierre. How do you feel? We're looking after your dog, in the meantime. What meantime? Try to do a different row for each kind. Hello. How are you all? - Hello, Guy. - Hi, Nathalie. Nathalie the doctor. You're beautiful, but I'm not surprised! Everyone knows the doctor? Nathalie the doctor. I'm here to see Nicolas. Here he is! How are you, Nicolas? Good evening, goodbye, Happy New Year. You're in love with Nicolas! You are, I can tell. Shall we go? - Go on, Nicolas. - Tomorrow. Nathalie won't be here tomorrow. Let's calm down, please! You do yours, okay? Remember me? You thought I was a grunt. I'd rather make shells. Shells are better than boxes. Not the same use. What are these boxes? The women made them during the 14-18 War. Pity, they wouldn't have let me. I'd have let you. You'd be a great munitionette. What's a munitionette? A woman who makes shells. You know the German legend? No one does. What's it about? About a stab in the back. An attempt to shift blame from the German army for the defeat, by making the civil population responsible. That myth undermined the Weimar Republic and assisted the rise of the Nazi Party. You know your history. I know the 14-18 War. Hello, everything okay? How's it going? Hello. Too bad you can't dance. Go ahead, have a laugh. You realize I nearly died? I had to crawl 100 metres to reach the phone in my jacket. I'd like to see you try it! See the guys selling beer outside? They're the hunters. The ones on the bar inside are the non-hunters. That's the key to this village. Which side is your dad on? He's above that. He's God here. The day he retires, or dies since he'll never retire, no more village. People will stop breathing and living. They'll just let themselves die. He thinks the world will end with him. I'm kind of worried. I hadn't seen him in a while. He seems tired. How's it going? - Am I interrupting? - Not at all. I host laughter yoga once a month. You should come. Laughter yoga? It's very serious. Laughing is good for your health. It improves circulation and boosts antibodies. I'll be in Paris, Guy. Sign up for it, Nathalie! - Okay. - You have to come. I'll come and try it. Thank you. Excuse me. Nice, isn't she? What? How are you? Fine. And the baby? You never came back to see me. Actually, we didn't keep it. We felt it wasn't the right time. Are you really okay, Ninon? Yes. Goodbye. A beer, please. I saw Sorlin. He's in a bad way. I'm sorry. I spoke to Norés. What did he say? Hospitalizing Sorlin was a dumb idea. Thank you all for turning up for our 8th country music festival. Thank you very much. I'd like to thank everyone at the town hall for helping me organize these events that allow us to get together... and enjoy life in our village of Chaussy. Have fun, have a great time. We'll be dancing all night. You know General Gallieni? General Gallieni? No. He was a soldier. And a great dancer. Can you dance? Yes. A little. I'm a great dancer. Really? Why aren't you dancing? Will you dance with me? A van's blocking the performers' minibus. Are you okay? Yes... See you tomorrow. Go on, I'm listening. I hoped for better. The tumor’s still there. What I suggest is a new protocol. A mix of radiation and chemo. Don't panic, it won't be too tough. We don't have any choice. And, quite frankly, it can give excellent results. Sorry, Michel, I won't do radiation treatment. What's wrong? I didn't call before, he was calm. Follow me. Send in the troops! Let's go! Stretcher-bearers! Stop or I'll shoot! Don't worry, I'll go. Nathalie, step forward! See, I have all the military gear. - Can I shelter too? - Look at it. Come down. So what's this? - An army helmet. - It's great. No, that one's a fake. - How old is it? - It dates from 1918. From the 14-18 War. - The one on your head too? - Yeah. Not the same use though. I know loads of war stories. So I see. Stories of the 14-18 War. How come? I learned them by listening to TV. - Documentaries? - Yes. - Seen a lot? - I saw a lot when I was 12. - You saw them more than once? - Yes. I watched them more than once and over again. - You speak German? - Yes. What does it mean? That means station. Station, "bahnhof". Yes, "bahnhof" means main station. Know how they say Roger Zabel in German? He's always been like that. He gets totally obsessed about things. I'll lighten the treatment. Let me know how it goes. All right. He has an exceptional memory and that's rare. In fact, I think it might be autism. But... I was told he lacked oxygen when he was born. He was blue. I really can't be sure, but it's worth considering. What difference would it make? You know... If it's autism, he can get special care and make progress. Maybe even read and write. Let's try anyhow, okay? Don't worry, there's no rush. We'll talk again. All right. Just a second. Here you go. We have a real glut of them. Thank you very much. It's very kind of you to do all this for him. I think he likes you a lot. It's better than with Dr Werner. We won't tell him that. Good bye. I'm keen about this health centre. Very keen indeed. It's my project. Why? Around ten years ago, we had two doctors here. Here's Cécile. Come in. Sorry I'm late. The departmental council, always early. I'm just joking. What was I saying? Yes, we had two doctors ten years ago and now just Jean-Pierre. And he won't live forever. So I think we need to consider the future. Yes, Mr Maroini. The regional council knows all that. Now, I'd like to hear what Dr Werner has to say. Of course. But careful, Jean-Pierre has a very personal view of things. Like Francis just said, I think we need to plan ahead and find a way to bring young doctors here. Sorry, but I don't understand. I don't get it. You said you were against the project. We need a solution. Right. Fanny, our nurse. I think it's a good idea. Yes, very good. Guy? Same thing. I see my job as team work rather than a solitary thing. We've often talked about it. Strength in numbers. Hold on a second. We want to work as a team? But we do that already. We all communicate. You're tackling it wrong. There are no doctors. Even with a health centre, they won't come. Other places do it. It's simple. In two years, we have four times as many health centers. Don't be so hasty. Most health centers are real estate deals, pure speculation. And they don't always work. They work in towns with a pharmacy, dentists, etc. But not in the country. The department helps doctors from the EU to settle here. In Verneuil, for instance, a Romanian stayed two months. It's not easy to adapt. That health center’s empty now. Imagine the cost. All right! So we do nothing and wait to croak? Francis, Nathalie has a point. We had an idea. Municipal transport could be good. Old people could come to us and the specialists in Magny. Right? Not bad. Also, the town council could help to computerize the doctor's office. Exactly. Excuse me, but that's not our remit. We're between two departments. The duty doctor comes 40 km for night emergencies across the Val d'Oise. For an emergency 4 km away in Normandy, it's another doctor who drives two hours there and back. It's absurd. If you'd fallen 50 meters away, you'd have been in Normandy. They pissed me off. I've screwed up. I'm with Sorlin. No, he's in the car with me. I've screwed up, I know. I'm on my way. Here's what we'll do. We'll relay each other. You come every morning at 11, Guy. Then Giséle will take over for his midday meal. Fanny, you'll come twice. Morning and afternoon for his treatment. Okay? Brigitte, you'll give him his dinner. Can the council have his meals delivered? Of course. Perfect. You can go home now. I'll stay with him a while. Thank you. See you, Guy. You know, this is a harrowing job. I feel I've spent 20 years working with suffering, with hardship, with worries... We mend... That's it, as doctors we mend. We mend nature's fuck-ups. We have to face the facts. What I call nature may be something else for believers. But don't tell me nature is beautiful. Nature... There are beautiful things, but horrible ones too. Nature is a barbarity. So we continually fight against a barbarity. It's good. Even if we know it will win in the end. Because it's not going to end. I'm glad you're here. I'm glad. You're next, Ninon. It's best if you wait here. Of course. Hold my coat? Hello. I haven't been sleeping well lately. For how long? I don't really know. Three weeks, a month. I'm not sure. Do you feel a bit depressed? Yes. A bit. Something happened? I had another abortion. You don't use contraception? No, we want a baby. Your friend asked you not to keep it? Yes, but he's right. I don't know if I could raise a child. I blow a fuse at times. What do you mean, blow a fuse? For instance, if he gets back late at night, I get angry. I know I shouldn't react badly, but I can't control myself. So he says it can't go on between us. He says I'm just a kid and not mature enough to have a child. Do you go out with girlfriends?
