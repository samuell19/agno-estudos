DRUGS: Paris sends commissioner JORDAN in Marseilles. - This cop means business. - Yes sir. He's also no fool. And if we don't watch it... our peace and quiet... ... are gone. As our lawyer, how do you think we should react? The police in Paris has sent their ace cop down to Marseilles. He's not the kind of cop we're used to around here. We've got to adapt to him. We've no choice. What do you mean? What makes him so tough? We can get rid of him easy. Everyone thinks that the world is full of things that are so easy. At first. Well they're not. To begin with, I'd prefer having him on my payroll. Just for a little while. Dominique! I want you to go to Marseilles with Cappa at once. Understand? I want to know all about this cop. I mean everything. After that, I'll know what to do. Yes sir. Police! Hands on your heads! I said put your hands on your head! Hey pal? Didn't you hear what I said? You got one hell of an act allright. You're new around here? Just slumming that's all. - Empty your pockets buddy. - He gets the pig of the year award. Now aren't you the cop on that tv series every Tuesday night? I said put your hands on your head and don't move! You can keep going, I'm a virgin. Another crack like that, and you'll die a virgin smartass! - What's with you? Trying to hide? - No. Empty your pockets! Faster! Hey Tonio. Why do you make me run after you? - Want to give me a heart attack? - No. - I've been looking for you for days. - Hey! You're still my pal? - Sure, yeah. That's better. When's it for? - I don't know man. - Look, cut the bullshit. When's it for? Three, maybe four days. Three, or four? Three. And what boat are they using? I want the name of the Goddamn boat the drugs are on! The Mister. Mister Nicholas. Well, there we are! Ah they can't catch us now. Calling control center. Hello! This is Delta Fox track 30. - Go ahead, Dumas here. - Mister Nicholas is leaving our territorial waters. - What do we do? - You catch them, that's what you do! - Go after them! - We're going as fast as we can. Sounds like your crew would be better off rowing. Mister Nicholas is beyond our reach. We're giving up the chase. Dammit all! They're too fast for us. They can go 50 knots faster than us. And besides that Mister Nicholas was only spotted three miles inside territorial waters. It was too late. Hello Marianne. I want to speak to Louis. Hello this is Jordan. Hey look, how about going up for a spin? Okay! What are we after? It's a heroin delivery. Head south - southwest. Hey, is that the one you're looking for Jordan? They're leaving. Cut the engine! If you're real smart you'll be fine. If you're real stupid you're in trouble. Get the stuff. Get down below, sweetheart. And you blew it. 200 kilos of heroin! And you act as if nothing happened! You break all the rules Jordan! You operate like a punk on the street! Not like a cop. Just look at the way you dress! Really Jordan, you think you look like a police commissioner? What the hell got into you? That heroin should be here in this office. We had everybody with us. The media, public opinion, governement. And Meccacci? The only man that I care about is Meccacci. Where would you like to begin? With the facts. Mister Meccacci is very, very annoyed with me. Right? No you're wrong commissioner. The police in France and in America are wrong about him. Everyone's wrong about him. Mister Meccacci had a stormy youth. That I grant you. Smuggling cigarettes in Tangiers, the casino war in Nice... - In Nice you do remember that he was the victim. - Sure I do. And he would never deal with heroin. You can check his record. It would be rather regretable if the incidents of the past few days weren't stopped in some way. If not they could move the commissioner to a different job, with a lot less prestige attached to it. - A commissioner who arrests hookers and cheap crooks. - Or maybe no commissioner at all. - Or maybe no commissioner at all. - Now you listen to me! You wanna know something? I'm not wrong, the French police aren't wrong and the Americans aren't wrong. Your client's a shithead. And you know what you can tell him? That since his youth was so lousy, he can look forward to an old age of peace. Because he'll rot in a cell doing time. I'll make sure he gets the message. Do that. - Hello. - Hi. - How are you? - Fine. Yeah? Sure, don't worry. We're on our way. I don't know you, you don't know me. That's better than nothing. - Big crowd tonight. - Well, well, commissioner Jordan. What brings you here? Somebody told me you were having a seminar. I'd like to see one of your professors, Alfred the chemist. - I've looked all over. - He's in Paris. But we don't know where commissioner. Why don't you go look somewhere else for Alfred? One day you're gonna find yourself arresting hookers and cheap crooks. That's funny, I've already heard that somewhere. From mister Meccacci, commissioner? You're right! Whenever I hear the name Meccacci I get all uptight. Ain't that weird? Hey, no need to get uptight commissioner! Have a drink with us instead. Your friend too. Claude, give the commissioner and his friend a drink. Here we are. The light. Wellcome. Walk right in. Sit down and make yourself at home. What are you drinking? I got cognac and whiskey, I got some orange juice too. Sorry. The party's over. Quick! Out you go. Wait there for me. Where is he? - They called the office. - Anonymously of course. Well now, was it you? Was it her? What shall we say? You are aware that we've got to have a story. - Why don't we tell the truth? - Jordan, let's be serious. Just kidding. We could say nothing and flush him down the toilet. Hey go on. Get yourself some fresh air. It can do wonders for you. Now. Just what do you suppose will happen to you? Nothing. What were you expecting? A reprimand direct from the chief? No, I'll be transferred out, that's all. For them it's an unofficial sanction. The boys upstairs call it "sweeping out the barn". You know someone high up. What can he do for you? - I thought he was your pal. - Sure, I've known him for ages. But you know what? About ten minutes ago our friendship ended. That I can guarantee. -There you are. - Thank you. Over here please. I want you to take good care of mister Meccacci. - Thank you very much. - Enjoy your dinner. It's a special occasion. You know, we're celebrating the departure of someone. The beautiful city of Marseilles has one less idiot to deal with. - Who are you talking about? - A friend of mister Meccacci's who works for the police. Champagne! Yeah, he's smart this Meccacci. Two years ago I had a chance. I was about to book the guy. I had proof and witnesses. I had him like that. And would you believe that the bastard got me into a jam. He made it appear as if I had accepted a bribe. Well you know, finding an envelope in your drawer, or a dead body in your house. What's the difference? Just as long as virtue's triumphant. I understand you like playing cowboy. You'll find things more peaceful around here. There's not much chance of you going on anymore airborne missions. Pigal is a very small neighbourhood. Petty crime isn't as exciting as what you're used to, but it'll keep you busy. - 3000 cases a month. - It's not a police station, it's a factory. Maybe. But you'll see that all the men here do very fine work. And they always do it as a team. That's a very important rule. That we all accept. Simon... Gablier... ... Rosenberg and Rojinski who you know already. And you. And none of you works for a sheriff, but for a boss. - You. - Right. This desk is for you. And this is my locker. Believe me commissioner. You're very lucky that you're here. You're lucky you're still alive after your caper with that helicopter in Marseilles. Meccacci could have finished you off once and for all. Why press the trigger? Actually is easier to just press a button. Are you implying I'm somebody's lackey, commissioner? I wasn't implying a thing. I don't like to be taken for an idiot. It's not my fault you're a cop sugar. Christian Rigo. Born 4/4/1955. Entered France in 1981. You know your residence permit's expired? - That's serious. - I know, I forgot to renew it. - It only expired two days ago. - A day's enough for us! I'm holding you overnight for not having a permit. - Up yours. - Shithead! You open that big mouth one more time, you hear? And I won't just book you for the permit. I'll hang a morals charge on you as well. The Turkish express. Ever hear about it? How about Mother Kemal? I've stopped chasing pushers. That's all over. That's a pity because three Turks just arrived this morning at the airport. As soon as they got in, they went right to Mother Kemal's. I told you, it's all over. The Turks all work for Selim Bay and Mother Kemal works for Meccacci. You don't mean our friend Meccacci? Yeah. The one and only. The scum of the earth. I guess we both must mean the same guy then. Police! C'mon! Get up! Tired? Rough day? - Where's the stuff? - I don't know what you're talking about. Welcome back to Paris buddy. Get over here. - Where's the dope? - I don't know. - I'll tell you where it is. It's right in there. Before the plane leaves you fill your gut with plastic bags. You're the Turkish express. Your belly's full of dope. And for three days you got to shit the whole cargo out of you. What do you creeps got to say? You're sweating? Afraid I'll hit you? Cause you know what'll happen. A little sack might explode in your belly! C'mon, easy now. You hit him in the stomach and he's through. What if I hit the lady? Think she'd help and give me a couple of names? Pretty quiet, aren't you? That's the report on Mother Kemal? No need to finish it up Jordan. The affair opened at Cite Bergere and closes at Cite Bergere. You're not thinking of letting them go, are you? I mean... They're diplomats. They'll be in Instanbul tonight. - But they... - No "buts" Rojinski. We cannot hold them without any proof that they're guilty. Look in their stomachs. You'll find plenty of proof. I think cutting them up is a little radical, if that's what you're suggesting. Who's this? This is mister Mansur. Assistant to the ambassador of Turkey. And he came for what, mister Mansur? He came to accept on behalf of his ambassador... ... your excuse. Or an apology if you like. That's why he came here. Well, you're the boss here. Do we cave in? Yeah, we cave in. It's the old foreign service tradition of dropping your drawers, so tell him we're sorry. It's two hours I've been here. I'm sick of your questions! Let me go! Let me go! Name, address, profession. I'm talking to you! Name, address, profession. If you don't answer I'll hold you here for 48 hours. Now, for the last time. Name, address, profession. You can beat her all day. She won't say a word. - There's a better approach. - It's the only way to get her to speak. Hold it, let me explain. Sit down pal. Where were you last night? Son of a bitch, you're mad! You see? It didn't work. You're uptight. Now, we'll try again, calm down. Let's try it again. Where were you last night? You're out of your skull! I said calm down. We're only talking. It's like I told you. You give someone a wallop, he gets mad at you. He climbs up, right? You hit him again... ... you've lost him for good. - Leave me alone you Goddamn nut! - You can get anything you want if you do it with style. It's a question of style. Livia Dolores Maria Monteblanco. 10 Rue Saint Jacques. Profession hooker. Well there you are. It's been a long time man. C'mon, get in. - About time you dropped by. - I've been busy. How's Janine by the way? Janine's fine, she's just fine. She cleared out? - It's a shame. You did your best for her. - I sure did. The studio for example. - The autobianchi, new dresses. - How come she split, just like that? Were you too hard to take? 4 hours cycling, 5 hours rugby and boxing at night? It's not easy on a girl. Well you weren't much for sitting around. You know what? You're right. I'm pretty much like you. Sad though. One hell of a broad. Is business always this lousy? Pretty much. I've got to find a few new customers. Yeah, you'd better. Because your studio, for example, new car, lots of dresses... ... this place isn't gonna pay for all of that, is it? - No. - It's a front, isn't it? I got 50 machines in Pigal, 60 in Clichy, the north of Paris is my territory. If I stay on homeground, I'm set. Sounds good, till it goes bad. It's legal. Even the government gets a cut. It used to get a cut on whorehouses too. Until one day it was over. - They earn you a lot more money than hookers. - Sure, they're an improvement. Discreet as hell. No worries about them ever getting sick. Or being jealous. - They don't talk to cops, either. - And what would they say if they were able to talk? They might tell me who's the bastard financing it all. What if I began asking you about Marseilles and the dead body they left as a souvenir? Cut the bullshit and get this through your skull. Two years ago, when I last saw you, you were a small time crook. I wasn't crazy about it, but you know, it was okay. No problem. I get back, and what do I find? This. And don't think I don't know who's behind all this. - These machines stink of heroin. - Come on now, first of all... - There's no first of all! And no second of all. Listen Francis... ... the small stuff, I've closed my eyes to. But I can't keep them closed forever. Not even if I wanted to. Listen, these people don't ever let you quit on them. It all seems great at the beginning. But soon... ... you find the road ends with a bullethole. - You understand that? - Yeah. I heard you allright. - Why don't we talk about other things? - Yeah? Like what? We've been through hookers and boxing... we can't talk about work, cause it's a sensitive issue... that's it I guess. I guess that's the way it goes. Hey, listen! I was playing poker and the guy I beat was broke, so he gave me this in exchange. That is an armoured car. Armoured? That's pretty good. - Does it run? - It sure does. 300 horses under the hood. How do you expect me to find someone to buy this thing? Say, you know anyone who needs protection? Yeah, maybe. The pope! C'mon handsome. Hey, out shopping? - Hello.- Hello. - How about it? No thanks. He's cute. I'd like him for an hour or two. You want anything to drink? - Or you're waiting for your date? - An orange juice. No wait, let's live it up. I'll have a cherry and soda. I was looking for someone. Actually, his friend in Marseilles is looking for him. Alfred. Alfred. That his second name? Or his first? He's also called "the chemist". Freddy the chemist. The guy you're looking for doesn't come here anymore. We're kind of sorry he left. He was always here flat on his butt. The guys used him to wipe their shoes on. How would you like to take his place? It'd be a pleasure wiping my shoes on your face. You know you're very amusing. If you break anything you pay! Fight outside if you want. Yeah. We don't want people to stare. You ought to put something on, a brassiere. I'm sure it would suit you. - I'm right behind you. - Not too close sweetie. Ladies first. - You're trying to rile me? - No, just teasing buddy. Let's go. Sweet dreams sweetie. Son of a bitch! I bet you forgot. Livia Maria Dolores. - Where you're going? - Wherever you are. There's scotch, scotch and scotch. Scotch. - Big place! - It's a bit cramped but I manage. - Who is she? - My maternal grandmother. Remarkable woman. Here. You know, I never thought you would live in a place like this. - No, never. - Oh, yeah? Why? I thought it would be more modern. - With plastic and neon lights? - How do I know? It's funny. It's just like you live with your parents. It's not as funny as you think. A few years ago I had a studio in the Latin Quarter. But when my parents died, I... ... I wanted to keep all the books and furniture... ... as they were. Rooms and things I've known as a kid. I couldn't figure out any other solution. So I packed up and came home. That's it. Are you happy here? Was Louis XVI happy at Versailles? Who knows? But it was still his father's pad. If we give up our traditions, where are we? You're laughing? Why? Because for a policeman you're pretty funny. You're unbelievable. Most cops want me to tell them what I'm doing here, where I'm from, my reasons for being a hooker. Because I know the answer. You were raised in poverty. You had 24 brothers and sisters all of whom mom would beat up because papa hit the bottle. And when you were 12 years old you began to wonder what men thought when they looked at you. Certainly not about Louis XVI. Fifty fifty. God bless you my friend. Of course the machines belong to you. They're yours. But you've got to be careful you know. A few people, simply out of jealousy, threatening your machines and your life... Aren't you afraid of that? They'd leave you in peace if they knew mister Meccacci was behind you. But not if you're alone. I want to make a proposition. Strictly on a friendly basis. 30,000 a month and you stay safe with me. As far as everyone else is concerned, you're the boss. For everyone else, but not for me. I hate to make you feel worse about it Francis... ... but you see your opinion's unimportant. Hey Tonton, remember you asked me to come here. Why the unhappy face? The last time I saw you, I ended up in this hole. Okay, tell me what I can do for you. Not me. I don't need anybody's help. I got 20 years and I'll do them all. You cops don't know what it's like... ... 20 years in an 3x5 cell! What do you care? I wouldn't care either if it wasn't for the kid. When you arrested me she was left with nobody to look after her. A 12 year old kid. Hey, you should have thought of that before. Catherine's 16 now. If you don't spring her from where she is, she'll be lost for good. You hear what I'm saying? She'll be lost. Lost at 16. These junkies got their hands on her. She's a prisoner in this house on Rue De Lyon. It's crawling with dope. They fill her with heroin and then they screw her! - One day they're gonna kill her. - Since when are you a crusader against drugs? When you sold dope to kids and got them hooked you didn't lose much sleep over it. As long as they paid you. And now I've gotta go to a house full of crazies, spring your precious daughter and probably get cut to pieces doing it. Any thing else you'd like me to do? Why ask a police officer? Why not a gorilla? You're not a police officer. You are the best gorilla I know. Could be. Tonton, I've got the perfect deal for us. Between two gorillas. Alfred. Think now, you've got a good memory. Freddy the chemist. And you can fuck off Jordan! You know what I think of you? As a father you're nowhere. As a friend as well. Because if I don't get to him now, before Meccacci's hoods do... ... Alfred, the chemical genius, is all through, like Pasteur. Except they won't name a street after him. Commissioner. Simon? Do me a favor. Tell me about the house on Rue De Lyon. Oh no, you can forget about that. These quarters got a lot of west Indian musicians. It's a political thing. We were told not to touch it. I see. Turkish diplomats, Chinese restaurant owners and west Indian artists. Thank you very much inspector. What do you think of Simon, anyway? A sellout, a fool, or just a chicken? He works for the boss Garnier, that's all. Who does Garnier work for, then? No one except maybe Garnier. Jordan on the level now, what the hell do you care about those quarters on the Rue De Lyon? Because I'm telling you, getting in is easy, but try getting out. - That's just in case you were thinking of paying a visit there. - Who me? You out of your head? - What the... - Catherine Serudi. 16, blond, her old man's worried about her. - Why the hell you're asking me for? - She's in there. We both know it. So you're gonna tell me exactly where. What do you want? This is Jasmina. And I want 100 francs. - Catherine. Where's she? - She won't cost you anything at all. She's everybody's girl. The room at the end of the corridor. Is that Catherine? Yeah. My name's Speed. She's been like this for two days. It's your father who asked me to get you out of here. Help me with her. What the hell's going on? You expect me to let you leave just like that? What's the matter, you in a rush or something? Yeah, I'm in a rush and I'm leaving just like that. Speed, my car's a black Renault. You'll see it when you leave. Get her inside. Speed! Stay where you are! - Speed, I said a black Renault. - Now he's giving orders! Listen to this son of a bitch! If you hadn't played the smartass, I would have probably let you go anyway. She can drop dead whenever she wants, I don't give a shit. The deal's off, so don't expect to get out of here alive. I said a black Renault, now get a move on. Well, you see? What was the point of getting angry? You can go faster than that. - What do you want? - I wanna talk to Freddy. - He's upstairs. - Thanks. Looks delicious girls. - Who's there? - Commissioner Jordan. Commissioner Jordan. But I thought you in Marseilles. No I left Marseilles. You left Marseilles, Tonton left Marseilles. Pretty soon there won't be anybody left in Marseilles. Tonton, huh? Why did you mention Tonton? Was it he who sold me out? Nobody sold you out. Call it intelligence. We all do it. Don't we Alfred? Don't you miss Marseilles? Those were the days. Gangsters and business suits. Two tone shoes. Luxurious cars and hotels on the old port. The stuff you made was 90% pure. You were the best, you know that, don't you? And now I find you hiding in this flea trap. You come up here just to tell me that? - I know you've been looking for me all over the place. - I'm not the only one looking. Meccacci's also looking. Why? Any idea? Meccacci hates junkies like me. And he hates faggots. That gives him more than one reason to be looking. Gabriel, my boy, why don't you wait for me next door? And no lectures please on your mister Meccacci. You want Meccacci, you got him. - For a price. - A big one? - When you look like I do and you're getting old as well... ... and you're going on a honeymoon... ... you have to be loaded with it. I want plenty. What's "plenty", Alfred? How much? A million francs. 3rd race official results; Winner number 9, place 11, show 3. 100,000 francs is hard enough. This is a million! And what's more, you can't make me lend you the money. No, I can't make you do anything. But who's gonna make me shut up about your little rip-off of the Arabs? And besides, the Arabs, no one can make them cut your throat, but they could. So, no one's making anybody do anything. Well. I guess there's nothing more to say. - The moment you feel like it, give me a call. - And what if it's... why don't we talk some more? All right, I'm going to look into your problem. Don't you mean you're gonna look into your problem, pal? I would advise you to drop your gun. Now lean up against the railing. Spread'em! Okay. Now march. Let's go! Mister Meccacci, Angelo wants to speak to you personally. Hello Angelo. Mister Meccacci, Alfred's had a serious accident. Something happened between you and the commissioner? An argument? He's really crazy. You know in Marseilles he almost killed someone. If it's narcotics you should have told the boss about it because he won't like it at all, from you especially. It's not quite the same. This time it's a murder. Commited on Alfred Gonet, alias Freddy the chemist. Old Freddy's dead? Isn't that sad? He used to give us a run for our money. But why was he killed? He should know why. He's the guy who murdered him. - Hey, what are you, crazy? I don't know who you're talking about. - That's because you don't pay attention. A man called Freddy the chemist. - Never heard of him. - East end station. Ever hear about it? - I know it exists but I never go there. - And Meccacci? You don't know him, I suppose. - I don't know any Mopacci. - And the guy that you were with, you don't know him either. You couldn't have seen me with anyone. I'm a loner. I don't know any guy. I live all alone with my cat. Wow, inspector. Our friend here lost his memory, but I'm sure it's just temporary. - Hey, that's not legal man. - Oh, yeah? Is that legal? 48 hours from now our friend here is gonna tell us his boss's name, also the name of his pal... - ... and maybe the name of his cat. - I think he'll crack sooner than that. Hey, that's dangerous, you're risking a lot! What if I have a heart attack or something? What do I know about medicine? It's not my field. But, if you think you might collapse on us, I'd prefer having your confession right away. Then we get inspector Rojinski here to tape it, and everything is cool. And you can fuck off! Well, keep him on ice, okay? And if he gets back his memory, call me before his coma starts. Now, I must go. My private life starts properly at eight. And I mustn't keep the lady waiting. Gentlemen. See you Joe. Commissioner! The shirt you ordered. - Think it's pretty? - That's for you to tell me. You see I only bought it to have lunch with you. I prefer you in a sweater. And I prefer having dinner to lunch. Suppose we make it another time. - Hey, what you're doing here? - Waiting for my mother. There! I found your date for dinner. He's free. Sorry sir, you can't park here. What's the matter with you? Dammit, how do you expect me to do my job? All right! Cool it man, two minutes. Hi. Is Livia here? - What is it? - Look at this. Why did they do that? Because I make love to a cop, that's why. If I do it again they said I was finished. Great! Is that all? A couple of them want your ass in a sling. And who are these moralists? They're the Tourian brothers. If I wanted to find them, where would I look? They love gambling. The "Shanghai", the "Paradise", or the "Winner's Garden". Sorry. - Hello. Have you seen the Tourian brothers? - They haven't been around tonight. Be careful. They're pretty tough. Hello Jack. - What's up? - Hello commissioner. - You seen the Tourian brothers? - They're in front of us. Second row. - What's so funny? I was thinking about that cop's face. - When he first lays his eyes on her. - You know the guy? No, but I'll bet you he's one of those 98 pound weaklings. - I bet the only excitement the guy ever had was getting off. - Yeah. Good evening everyone. I'm hungry waiter, and I'm in a hurry, too. - My name's Georges. - Hello Georges. Steak and fries. A pinch of salt. - Georges! - Hey watch what you're doing! - It's all my fault, I wasn't paying attention. Please Georges, a refill. - Gentlemen the drinks are on me. - That's enough! - Don't get upset. Why you're upset? My name is Jordan. Commissioner Jordan. You are the brothers Tourian and Tourian. Handy with a razor, especially with defenceless women. You know, someone told me you'd love to have my ass in a sling. Good idea. Would you like to begin? Well Georges, my steak. After you called I looked at my alarm clock. I couldn't believe the time! I can't imagine you ever getting up at 6 a.m. - I'm always asleep. - Now, you want coffee, coffee, or coffee? - Tea. - Coffee! - But I want tea. - Tea. Ah, the Tourians. I won't forget that. They won't forget it either, believe me. You know, I would have liked it better at Maxim's. There's atmosphere and music. - You've been to Maxim's? - I went there one night with Mario. He's a dancer. A good friend. - Maxim's is the place where they got an orchestra. - Yeah. - Where there's dancing. - Yeah. - With a view at the river. - Not from there. Are you sure it wasn't "Maxie's" where you went with Mario? I'm always doing that. I'm awful at getting names right. Say, you know my name is not Gustav? - You know that? - Don't worry. - What's my name then? Francis? Listen, something came up, but I'm on my way. I'll be right over. Okay, I'll wait here. The table's reserved, so don't you worry. Okay. See you. What a small world. I look through the rear-view mirror and who do I see? Inspector Simon. Stay where you are. I wanna look at your dog collar. - Listen Jordan, I'm warning you! - Ah, just what I thought it would say. - If lost, please notify chief commissioner Garnier. - I have the right... On a leash. You belong on... a... leash. Look, my battery's dead. Bastards! Get out! A 100 miles an hour chase through the streets of Paris! And finishing up with two gangsters getting blown up and before that, the escapade at East end station! A shootout in broad daylight in the middle of the rush hour! When the illustrious mister Jordan got here, I told him he won't have much chance of using a helicopter... ... and going airborne again, because it was a small neighbourhood, but... ... I shouldn't have underestimated the man! Even without using a helicopter, he can still be a shithead! And now I'm closing the Jordan file forever. I'll let the ministry deal with it for a while. Tell your friend that, if you're lucky enough to find him. - But sir he tried several times to get ahold of you but... - Aaah and he couldn't get through to me. I've got one too many shitheads as it is, Rojinski. Just in time. The boss reviewed your record for us and told us that he thinks you're a shithead. - And he begun with the Turks. - No, East end station came first. Whatever he says I don't care. I'm interested in our good pal Marc Villa. Does he miss the stuff? How's he making out? He's making out okay now that he's gotten his fix. The guy's on cloud nine, and you'll be too when you see this. Answer: No, I was sent over from Italy. They felt they needed somebody unknown to follow commissioner Jordan. Question: You mean to kill? Answer: No, simply to follow him around and lead me to Alfred Gonet. And were you supposed to follow Gonet? Answer: No, to murder the guy. Question: Who was your first contact? Answer: His name is Baldi. All I know is his name. - Baldi! I know him. - Meccacci knows him as well. Baldi. Otherwise known as "Snowhite". - Antonio's not here right now. - I thought he'd be asleep at this hour. He sleeps when he wants to. Tell Antonio that commissioner Jordan would like to see him. Baldi. Commissioner Philippe Jordan. Have you ever heard of him before? Yeah. I want you to make sure we never hear of him again. Well, he's a cop and... you can't just knock off a cop. Those ideas are old fashioned. Yeah, Francis was always getting into trouble. With his bikes or his cars. But never once did he get arrested. So I figured if Francis got to be a cop he'd have a good chance of never being arrested. But the guy was hopeless as a cop. He never arrested anybody. It depressed him. He said it was a waste of time because the next day we'd just let them go anyway. He might not have been altogether wrong. Did you know him for very long? For sixteen years. He was center forward for the Diablos in the play-off. A very nice guy in the gym, but during the game, tough as they come. But when you were his age, you were tough, right? No, not till I was older. Did you have a little brother, or a little sister? No one but Francis. Rojinski. First I've got to make a link between Meccacci and the machines. Then two, I connect the machines to the crime. And the crime to Meccacci. And then, I just let it all work out. I've got something to do now. Look up the past. - You mean you're leaving? - Sure, you can stay here, you'll be allright. - Stay with Livia? - Yeah, of course with Livia. Why, you're afraid of her? - Where is he? - Gone. - Did he say anything? - He told me to stay. So I said "with Livia?" and he said "why, you're afraid?". That was kind of dumb, huh? From the time Francis died he hasn't been the same with me. This is Antonio Baldi. - I hear you wanna see me. - Yeah. Well I'm downstairs. Well now, I'm here. You mind telling me what I have done? - Someone mentioned your name. - Who's that? Marc Villa. - Doesn't ring a bell. - He's a junkie. He told me you were the one who hired him to get rid of Freddy the chemist. A junkie would sell his own mother for a fix commissioner. But I didn't come here for myself anyway. But because mister Meccacci's waiting for you. I'm just a messenger. You should have told me that right away. Because any time I wanna see Meccacci, I can summon him officially. Sure. If he shows up. The last time you tried to get smart, he got off, and you got transferred. Okay. What do we do now? We'll go and see mister Meccacci. Where we're going? Are we having a little game of billiards in Clichy? No. It's the head office tonight. He never discusses serious things anywhere else. Here we are. Wait for me, I'll tell him you're here. - Hey what the hell are you doing? - Uh uh, you wait for me. You're crazy. Now get these things off me. What's with you, huh? I don't buy your story. I think it's a trap. We're both gonna wait. But not together. Don't leave me here commissioner! Let me out! You've got no right! They'll be here any second. Let me go! Let me go! Don't leave me here dammit! Baldi? Is that you? Baldi is dead. What are you doing here? I'm not here Meccacci, I was murdered. I know you'll miss me. I was good for laughs, remember? Of course you do. The cop arrived, showed you his badge, shouting "police, you're under arrest". Then your buddy Cappa came in and the farse had begun again. The trial was a joke. One more time you went home. And then mister Meccacci punished the wise ass cop. They sent him to another town. The wise ass was me. And just what are you here for, now, mister Jordan? You figure it out. There is one possibility. You can take the easy way out. Make things simple. No arrest, no trial. Yes. But... it's completely... ... crazy. Crazier than pushing dope to kids as they come out of school in the afternoon? So that a few dirty old men can pay for 12 year old hookers? And you? I wonder what age you prefer your whores. After so many years I'd nearly given up hope. Of what? Of watching you die. But then the theory won't work anymore. There will be a trial, but I won't be tried. You will. But for it to be my own trial, I would have to be using my own gun. And this one belongs to Baldi. Sir are you commissioner Jordan? - Yeah. - We looked just about everywhere for you. Will you follow us please? Hello? TB 7 here. Get me inspector Rojinski on 2909. Tell him commissioner Jordan is here waiting. Inspector Rojinski. Guess what Jordan? Someone just killed Meccacci in his club. - You're kidding? - No, I mean it. Happened two hours ago. They just got it over the wire. I wanted you to be the first to know, that's why I've been trying to get in touch with you. Now wait a minute. Who do you think would want to get rid of someone like Meccacci? You got any bright ideas? No, it beats me. It could have been someone in the organisation wanting to take his place. I'm positive it's political. Nowadays everything is political. Maybe you're right. See you around pal. Thanks a lot. You want a ride back?
