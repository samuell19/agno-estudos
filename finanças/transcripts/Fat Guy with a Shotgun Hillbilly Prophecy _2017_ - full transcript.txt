Master Ambrose He gave me a long list of whereto's and whatfor's And it is a long list because he is a wordy motherfucker But, what it all boils down to is a fat man had to die. So, if you could get out in an orderly fashion And then say... run for 20 feet in that direction, in a straight line of course I'd consider it a kindness. What exactly did I do to piss off what was it? MASTER Ambrose? Shit son, I don't know. It ain't like Master Ambrose and I have cookies and tea, y'see? If it makes you feel any better...

Special Agent Duane Delmont Federal Bureau of Investigation This is my partner Dwayne Dellmont You boys twins? No sir. No relation. Look, you boys need to get in line Because I am looking for an escaped convict. Uh, we're working a kidnapping. I'm afraid our case takes precedence. The girl has been missing for 43 hours and.... seventeen minutes. Damn its uh... gotta be embarrassing. To get all dressed up and uh two other gals show up with the same shit you got on. Sweetie. I'm so glad you're home. I missed you. Ahhh, sugar. I missed you too. It was a long day at the office. How was your day? Busy I had to clean the play room. You forgot to walk her before you left this morning. Ohhh, hunny. Sorry, I forgot to walk that bitch this morning. It won't happen again. It wasn't a problem. Did my brother stop by? Yes. And did you do everything he needed done? Of course. Otis needed help twice. I figured you two could discuss that later. Good Girl. Daddy's tired. I think I'll go to the playroom and housebreak that bad girl. Dinner's going to be ready in a half an hour. Perfect Hello, little girl. I'm here. Daddy's home. I hear you had a little accident. No, that's not good. You've been a bad, bad girl. Fuck... that bitch bit me. Master Ambrose shore does pay well. DID YOU SAY AMBROSE? Who the fuck are you?" Did you say....Ambrose?" FUCK! You can't hit shit, you fat fuck! Can I interest you in some primo meth? What are you doing this Tuesday? I can make Tuesday work. You serious? You'll marry me on Tuesday? Cause I was... I had this whole thing YES. Yes, yes, yes. Uh.... This is funny. I had something I wanted to tell you too. Well, my news obviously wins You know, cuz.... This beautiful dame just agreed to marry me. Can you believe that? Well, THIS Dame... Is also pregnant. I... uh... uh... UH.... You can speak. It's allowed. You're going to be a Daddy. Huh.... Tuesday? No, we have a few months left for that. What the hell man... what did we ever do to you? Not a goddamn thing. But you work for Ambrose. And, I need to send a message. Fuck you. You know, that looks pretty bad. Might want to get someone to take a look at that. You know, if you live long enough. You should go tell Ambrose that death is coming. On second thought. I'll tell him myself. And then he destroyed my final minion. Well, it looks like you're running out of minions there, Lou. Stupid Fucking Game. Uh... em... I'll just.... THERE! I WON! Now, Lou... all games have rules. Rules are for losers. Ask him about Uz. Tell that to the man from Uz. That's right. You're the evil one. Beezelbub Abbadon, destroyer of worlds. Don't get cute, Doc. Those guys are all amateurs. I'm Lucifer. Ahhh... I forgot. Tell me about Job, Lou. I made a deal with God. I bet that I could turn Job away from God. Hmmm, God won that wager If I recall. But, at a might steep price I still got my pound of flesh. Sure you did Lou. Sure you did. Are you questioning my powers? Tell you what. Strike me down. Go ahead. I'll wait. Huh? Eh. Hmmm. It doesn't work like that. Of course it doesn't. So, what happened next? Hey! Look, I already gave my statement and they already yelled at me and handed me my walking papers. You were the one driving the convict? No, I was riding shotgun. We were on a long stretch of road. And my partner was giving me water we missed the last bathroom for a 60 mile stretch. I just had to go, take a piss. I had no idea that he would try and kill the convict. WHAT? Yeah, my partner was paid by someone to kill the convict. That is not what the Sheriff or the Department of Corrections told me. Of course not they're all on the same payroll Why are you telling me this? I promised the fat man that I would tell the truth. And I intend on doing just that. So, he didn't violently escape? Oh, it was violent already but it was self defense pure and simple. But, he did kill other convicts at his previous prison? Yeah, but only after they jumped him. He killed them all at once? Yeah. The paperwork says, that he killed five other convicts over several months. No, it was all at the same time. I was there. He killed them in the shower with just a goddamn bar of soap. There were a lot of naked body parts that I had to pick up I transferred to transpo the next day. You can only handle so many uh severed members before its time to rethink your career trajectory. Probably a good idea. Did he mention where he was going? No offense, lady when a fatman is holding a shotgun to your head its really not time to ask him his evening plans. ANYTHING? He didn't say anything. Just between you and me Mayor Ambrose pays a lot of the bills around here if you catch my drift? I know for a fact that my partner did some off hours odd jobs for him. The mayor? You say mayor. We say God. But, you didn't hear that from me. Thanks. What the fuck am I gonna do? My Daddy told me to be a cop, be a cop he said GOD.....DAMMIT Well, this here's the Harlan house. So... You know they have a door, right? I ain't allowed on the porch. That's fair. What the hell are you doing here? Now, Arthur, I'm just here to deliver the feds. The Feds? Special Agent Duane Dellmont this is my partner Special Agent Dwayne Delmont Ya'll related? No relation, sir. Well, what can I do for you? May we come in, sir? Yeah, ya'll are welcome but leave the local fucknut ARTHUR! Leave the retard on the porch. ARTHUR! Leave the special needs student on the porch. Bettah! Again, that seems perfectly fair. Thank you Deputy. Yeah. OWWW! I ain't a GODDAMN retard. Your granddaughter has been missing for... 45 hours and 12 minutes. THAT WE KNOW OF. That's when we first called it in to the local fucknuts. Local law enforcement. How long had she been missing before that? She left for classes. Uh... She's a theology student. At the university. Near the top of her class. Was she unhappy? Not at all. Any enemies? Of course not, she's a young woman. Ma'am in our experience age doesn't matter. Anyone who might want to do her harm? Angry boyfriends? No but we did have a breakin here about 4 days ago. Why didn't you call it in? Is that what they told you? I did call it in. Sheriff Bojangles and Deputy Fucknuts told me it probably wasn't anything. ARTHUR! Estelle! I love you. 45 years of matrimonial bliss with you, but I swear to God if you correct my accurate portrayal of that idiot one more time It ain't mean, if its true. There is a polite way and an impolite way to call someone a fuckin' idiot. And you don't call that fucktard a fuckin' idiot in front of strangers even if he is a wicked fucktard. Ma'am if we could focus. The fucking idiot said? She said, fucktard. Thank you, my mistake. They came out, told me kids or animals, or Look, ain't no animal leaving a size 12 boot print. Did you see them? Uh... no, but the neighbors did. Wonderful people. Lutherans. But, we can forgive that indiscretion. Ma'am. They described a group of gang members Gang members? Yeah, we got us a bunch of kids who think their pants shouldn't fit driving around all tough and inner city hard while they're driving past cow pastures. You know, I used to act tough too driving past cow pastures except mine were in Nam! Oh, you were in Nam? Do you have any description beyond that? Well, yeah. Neighbor said they all kinda looked alike like they could be brothers. I know where they live if it helps. Wait, you know where they live? Well, it is a small town. Sheriff told me to... stay away. And I've been doing that. But, I swear to God, if they had anything to do with this I will SHOW them what I learned in Viet-NAM. All right, that's all the questions we have right now. Thank you both for your time. Semper Fi. Do or Die. Semper Fi, boys. You bring her home. She'll come back, right? Well, at least we have some professionals on the job now. Instead of the wonder twins of ineptitude. It's dinner time. I caught me some road kill. Think I need to teach him a thing or two about talking to outsiders Did he learn? Well, he ain't talkin'. I say it's a lesson he won't soon forget. Well, we still gonna do this here ritual tomorrow night? Well, it is the blood moon. Why? You growing attached to your little toy? She is fresh. Heh... she still screams when you mishandle her. Well... It can't be your wife She's already over 21. The sacrifice has to be a woman under 20 years. You know the scripture as well as I do. Wait... we could snatch you another but, The Feds are starting to sniff around. No, that's fine. We'll just put this bitch out of her misery and then I'll get a new one when the Feds aren't around. Or, maybe Lucifer will get me a new one, kinda as a reward? You sure you won't stay? I made pleny. Even baked some bread. No, I better get back to my toy while I still have her. Don't overcook those ribs. There are some things you can say to me, brother. Insulting my ribs is a touch too far. Well, you gotta eat 'em. Whatever makes you happy, brother. Makes me happy. Can you believe that? He had the affrontery to comment on my ribs... well, your ribs. That's just downright rude. Awww I think your ribs will be just fine. May I ask where your crime scene unit is? Did you hear that Tennessee? Federalis want to know where the crime scene unit is? Crime scene unit... that's funny boss. Why is that funny? You're in Appalachia County now boy. We are the crime scene unit. We've got a deputy marshall out there with the finest ass you ever did see. She's on the job. Did you just call my partner, boy? Aw hell It's just a term of endearment around here. For colored boys. Term of endearment that's funny boss. Bet your kind used to call slavery, having house guests. Oh, hell yeah. With benefits. I will cheerfully take your racist ass outside. What are you gonna do? Assault an officer? What do you know? Well, it was bloody. Any sign of the girl? That's right, you boys are looking for a girl. I hate to break it to you hoss All the body parts we found were male. Were they all brothers? What you trying to say? All us white boys look alike? Uh... Its a term of endearment, deputy. How many people did this? A witness said it was a fat guy with a shotgun. Aw hell no... I don't reckon we have witnesses around these parts. Oh, well that's cute. The witness says you haven't got any cops around these parts. WHO SAID THAT? Tell me where they are and we're we're going to take care of dem. All right, Tennessee. Do you gentleman want to take this conversation where its a little bit less.... stupid. Uh... yes... please. What kind of uppity yankee bullshit, is that? Yeah. Tell you what though, with an ass like that, its hard to hate that bitch. Yeah well, she probably reminds you of your Mom too. My Mom? Boy, whatchyu know about my Mom? Nothin'. Nope, nothin' nope. So, the shooter matches my guy's description. But, the bodies are the ones who apparently took your girl. How do you know that? WELLLLL..... I managed to swipe these before that sheriff even decided to mosey on up to the crime scene. Wait, you took these off of an active crime scene? What? SERIOUSLY? You going to bitch at me for contaminating their crime scene? Uh, no deputy, just impressed. We should team up. Pool our resources. Ignore the inept locals? Uh, they call them fucking idiots here. Actually, its fucktards. It's a term of endearment. Is that a yes? You have a deal. Okay then. A King belongs in his castle. Now Lou, not every powerful man is a King. No, but you haven't head of a King paying child support and eating dog food either. Preach it, BROTHER! You may enter. Oh look, honey. It's our local sheriff. And to what do we owe this honor this evening, sheriff? Is it time for another charitable contribution to the local law enforcement doesy-do? You got yourself a problem. And that problem would be? You got a fat guy out there killing all your boys. GOOOOOD! That's good? Walk with me Sheriff. Did you just sass me? No darling. My back was just hurting... a little. I'm sorry. Are you sure? Baby I would never- Goddamn right. Now, you just sit there and look pretty. Now... there's some questions that you have, I bet. Yeah, I got a few. Awwww you taste good, child. Ya all right sheriff? I'm fine. I don't mind covering for ya'll's family but I'd rather not watch this depravity. I don't give two shits on a stick, what you want. About this fat guy? Of course. Now, I didn't want to hurt the boy I just needed to get his dander up a little bit. You see... the fat guy He's my long lost brother. The baby? Baby boo.... Is he horseman? Hell yeah! Only the most glorious one of us all. It's gonna be bloody. WELL.... it IS the apocalypse. Now, you knew that when you signed over your soul for your pound of flesh. Tell me sheriff... How is that sweet young thang I sent over to you? She's fine. And, the sex? Is it everything you ever dreamed about in your entire life? Yeah. Well then the price has been bartered for you are bought and sold. And if I should tell you to lick the shit off the bottom of my boot. You are gonna hop to it... post haste! What do you want me to do about this fat guy? Tell you what you let him kill a bit more He needs to embrace his role of death. Tomorrow night! Under the blood moon... we cut this tasty treat from her snatch all the way to her throat. We let her blood bring forth our daddy. And then we rule the world by his side. AMEN....brother. What about me? Don't worry sheriff. In a world ruled by the darkest of souls there's always going to be a need for a good LOYAL Sheriff. Now, you get some of your boys together here and uh you pick a fight with my little brother and you let the blood flow. Yes sir. Shhhhhhhh Oh, you can see yourself out, you know where the door is. My brother and I have a toy that needs our undivided attention Shhhh Yeah... Oh this one is just too good We should have some fun first. No....no... You know the prophecy calls for a virgin sacrifice Now... we can play with the merchandise but we can't plaaaay with the merchandise. Well shit Rayland. I's got to get my willie wet. What do you think my wife is for? Awww... I'll take the back door. I guess I'll take the front door. Lead on brother. No, brother, after you. What a friend we have in Jesus So, what will you do if you finally win? WHEN. When I finally win. Of course, of course....WHEN you win. I'll give humans total freedom. Freedom from morals. Freedom from empathy. Freedom from God. God? You see Hell is... The rape of the Congo. The Armenian genocide. Nanking. Wu han Jewish ghettos Cambodia. Gaza Sri Lanka Sierra Darfur, Croatia Bosnia It all happened on his watch He gave them free will. That was his first mistake. So, you ask me what I'll do when I win? The first thing I'll do is eliminate adults from the equation. I'll raise children to bow before me. I will provide order where he provided chaos. I WILL BRING KNOWLEDGE. You won't let them discover it on their own? OH PLEASE... he would let them walk blindly through the wilderness for all of eternity. I'd give them direction. But, what will you do when they question I'll give them answers. To everything or... just to the questions you like? See... humans grow and learn they question. They try and they fail and they try again that's what makes them unique. Some try to follow God's instructions and some fail. Some will misuse his name or, misinterpret his intentions but, that's not really the point. So, what is the point? The point is that He was just the God of their creation. THEY are the Gods of their destiny and you want to rob them of that. NO... I want to harnass it. Some books say that God tried to harness it once and you and I both know what came out of that mistake. Then he should have ended the experiment. Let's talk about your wife Lillith. HEY! We agreed you would not bring her up. Lou, I am here to help you work through all of your anger and that includes the anger towards your wife. My EX... my ex-wife. You want to play? Okay, but what's the game? Go fish. Is your mouth ready to receive a python? I've seen your pecker Tenny. Its a garter snake at best. Goddamn she got you good.

God Damn... (footsteps You know that's what I love about Appalachia. Man can't find him a woman But goddamn he can talk his sister into a freebie. Fuck you, Sheriff. Fuck me, honey? I ain't the one in the midst of foreplay with her goddamn brothers. Well shit, Sheriff. It ain't incest if you're paying for it like everybody else. Allright what the fuck you want here?

Tell me about your tour. I'd rather not. All right, it was bad. Isn't that enough? Maybe for your buddies But you and I are here to help you get past this terrible ordeal. You have it all in your records. I know. But uh... tell me in your own words. In my words. I was the only goddamn survivor. What the fuck do you want me to say about it? That is a....uh... interesting choice of words for the only survivor. Sometimes life can also be a death sentence, doc. So, talk to me. Okay, initially it wasn't just me. Initially there were three of us. We made it the whole way with very little food. We were starving. We were gettin' real thin but, not just... thin yeah... We were holocaust skinny. The three of us Mikey had it the worst. Mikey was dyin'. In front of our eyes. And for some reason I wasn't losing the weight like everyone else was I still had my strength I could hack the pain. So... We were gettin' whatever little rations we had I was givin'a lot of em out. Mikey mostly. The amount of food I was givin' I guess his stomach burst. You know, you hack it through the march. Survive those fuckin' hellships. You get all the way to the camp. And just because some buddy gives you some extra bread. That's how you go? So, you're blaming yourself for an act of kindness? Wouldn't you? World War Two? What? Tell me about your childhood. Gettin' really tired of talkin, Doc. All right... its all in the file. No, its not John. All it tells me is you grew up in a group home and the work houses. Doesn't tell me anything else. All right, I really don't remember much. I know I was born in West Virginia. I know my Mother gave me up for adoption I worked in some shoe factory shortly after I turned six and I stayed there really, until I was old enough to enlist. And shortly after that I was in 4th Marines headed to the Pacific. Workhouses? How the fuck old is this guy? Pretty sure I have some siblings somewhere. Well, have you ever tried to find them? Nah... not really. Well, I've always believed um... the family that you choose is far more important than the family that you are given. I agree with that. You are a good man, John. So? We all done then? Almost John, almost. Have you ever... looked into your past? Not really. A little bit. I know the family name on my birth certificate says Ambrose. I met a woman. And uh... I'm going to ask her to marry me. But uh, I want to make sure the uh the nightmares stop first. Well I can't guarantee the nightmares will be gone forever, John. But, I do know you are a good man.
