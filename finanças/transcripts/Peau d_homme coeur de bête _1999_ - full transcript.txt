Skin of Man, Heart of Beast My sister and I have our life, both of us. Especially her. She has her own little life. She's 5 years old. We pay no attention to her. Especially last summer, we paid no attention. Today, I look at her. She doesn't speak anymore. She looks at me in silence. I know what she's thinking. I think about it every day, too. "In conclusion, I feel it is essential "to suspend Inspector Pujol from duty. "An extended sick leave "will allow him to examine the failure of his marriage, "given that he refuses therapy." Signed: Nicole Girard, police psychologist. That bitch is sick! I'm strong as a 15-year-old! I know! Kalfaoui is in hospital with broken ribs. Now give me your gun. I was drunk! Frankie, I have to take your gun away. Come on! Show me your wrist. Does it hurt? Henri! Let go! Animal! - You okay, Frankie? - He's fine. He needs a vacation. He'll come back nice and tanned. Right, Frankie? Animal. Go back to your village and see your daughters. Go on! Aren't you happy to see them? Aurélie! It was late summer. Dad had left us with Granny. Mom had gone away, so it was better. We were with family. Where were you, honey pie? We were happy. We felt safe. Then Dad came. You're not in Marseilles? Didn't I tell you? I'm on vacation. - What's with your hand? - A woman hit me. Give me a break! Will you stay so the girls can see you? You brought a storm. It's good for you... It's invigorating! Aurélie and I were waiting for Mom. It was our secret hope. But it wasn't she who came. Aren't we all the same? Waiting for something, for someone from the past, bringing back happiness. Looks like it's calmed down. Don't move! Drop your pants. Mom! They're waiting. Frankie's there. I've seen you in underwear before. Is the Gap girl going? What girl? You talked about a girl to Frankie. Mom. There's someone in my bed. Coco! Wake up. My God, you're here at last. Recognize him? Hi, Mom. I can't resist. Can I kiss you? - Dimwit! - Bibof! And René, your dad. - I came with my father. - Papa René. You haven't changed. Didn't you join the paratroopers? But I didn't re-enlist. Now I'm a security guard at the supermarket. He's not bad. Not bad... Excuse me, everyone's waiting for me. Go right ahead. Alex is coming. You can start. This is my Aurélie. Say hello. You're so pretty! There's Christelle, too. She's 13, but she's at a friend's. Doing her teen crisis. Looking at my fingers? Why are they twisted? Because I'm old. All worn out. Everybody! Quiet, please! Just a second. Sing us a song! Just a second. We're all here for Miss Espitalier who's leaving for a retirement home. Because women work, too. So they say! Caguette, shut up. We were all Miss Espitalier's students. She was very patient with all of us. Especially you. We loved you, Miss Espitalier. We were all... We were all in love with you. I loved you the most! I'm going to sing you a song you taught us back then. Get a load of my memory! We were 20 or 30 bandits in a gang All dressed in white, like... You hear me? All dressed in white, like shopkeepers. The first theft I ever did in my life Was stealing a wallet from... You hear me? Was stealing a wallet from a priest I went into his bedroom My God, it was so big! Come on. He's our brother, Frankie. What brother? Let me go! I lost him 15 years ago. No news. I should kiss him? Mom gave him a nicer welcome. I was in the army. He thinks I'm stupid. You think I'm stupid? Military service doesn't last 15 years. Afterwards, I signed up. In the Foreign Legion. Bastard! You're a real asshole. You okay? You okay? See? I kissed him. You haven't changed. You haven't changed. You've lost a little weight. Didn't he? You're the same, too. Sure! I'm out of shape now, right? Look at this. Put water on it. - Does it hurt? - No. I'm really out of shape. Did you puke, Henri? Excuse us, Miss Espitalier. We need him. Go right ahead. - We're doing a drinking contest. - Dance instead, it's better. No way! No fucking way! I'm Caguette! "Dumb-fuck Caguette." Remember me? Coco! My little Coco! Hot-ass Annie! If he's entitled, we all are! Where were you? Lay off him. He's tired. You could have sent us a postcard. Leave my brother alone! He's no circus freak. Did you get stuck in traffic? Yeah, like he walked here! I did walk here. You haven't danced with a girl in ages! You don't recognize me. Is that it? I was in love with you and Frankie. She hasn't forgotten her Coco. Look... Remember now? At school! But you were my favorite. Do I remember? It doesn't matter. You're sweet... Go sleep it off under a tree. - What the hell? - Just a harmless kiss. Tonight, I'm getting dead drunk. My asshole father! Here's to the three Pujol sons! And to their father! Now that was a man! Dad! Stop it! Their father had the balls to blast his brains out. He was my friend. We had a hard time in Algeria. Cut the crap, Dad. Dumb son of mine! Algeria belongs to France! Stop it, René! Cool it, guys! Calm down! He's back! - How are you? - Fine. Anthony, these are my brothers, Frankie and Coco. Make yourselves at home here. Have a ball. Alex is my buddy. You can always count on him. - Enjoy yourself! - If you want anything, just ask. Champagne for my pals! A live show in a cage. It's arty. They get my juices flowing. I'll rape me one. Aren't they something? Just do like this. Champagne! Serve my friends first! Have a great time, guys. Dance, drink, fuck and enjoy! Which one do you want? Which one do you want? I'll open the cage and give you one. What? I'll open the cage and give you one. Go on! Here's our go-go dancer of the night! Move it, Frankie! Up on stage and in the cage. Coco, look at him! I like your shoes. Real flashy! Get lost! - It's Alex's brother. - Damned faggot. I'm a friend of Anthony's. Here you go, Coco. Forget about it. - Is there a problem? - None. I asked about his shoes and he pushed me! I like his shoes. His shoes with the blinking lights? Give him your shoes. Relax. Take a deep breath. Get up, deadbeats! I don't see any ass! Listen to that. Does it remind you of anything? Annie! I'm going to eat you alive! Let me at her! No, stop! Bibof, don't let him climb on! - Grade-A tuna! - Stop it! I want to get off! Fuck off! Don't come near me! Beat it! Come on, Coco! Look at these tits! One for each of us. Your brother's got devil blood. Funny shoes. Are you cold? Want my jacket? Here you go. These stones are killing me! Every summer you screw me and... And what? You want us to get married? Hey, guys! I'm getting married to Annie! Stop it! This hurts! The stones are digging into me! I want you. You're going to refuse me? You give your ass to everyone and I don't get any? Why not? Tell me why! Come here! Stop it, you're scaring me. I have a present for you. To celebrate our reunion. Weren't there fireflies before? Before... but not anymore. You spent the night on the town. We went to see some ladies. With those teeth, you're not much of a ladies' man. Daddy's one. That's why Mommy left. He knows lots of ladies. Who told you that? Christelle? No, I saw Daddy's ladies at home. What are you talking about? You might as well take up fiction while you're at it! You bring your lady-friends home? You don't like having a son who's a real ladies' man? I wish you knew how to keep just one. I've always only had one and one alone. You, Mom. I'm full of piss and vinegar! Do like Daddy. Take nice deep breaths. I feel fit. I'm a lucky guy. I have a great little girl and the legs of a young man! Now look how fast Daddy can run! Take off my watch. I'm going for a dip. About Coco... He's not built like a legionnaire. He's a little skinny, a little frail. Maybe they don't feed you well. Take this. If anyone calls, I'm not in. I'm in the pool. Do you think Coco can teach me a few things? The combat stuff they do in the Legion, like Chuck Norris. See that? I'm bad. - Pretty supple. - Yeah. I keep fit, Alex... When you work nights, it's either keep fit or get fat. I like this dumb little swimsuits. No bones about it. Johnny Weissmuller in Tarzan. 40 meters, swallow dive. Hey, geezers. Her dad's on his way. - Hello, Jessica. - Who's he? Your uncle Coco. I heard you were dead. - Are you crazy? - He's your uncle. Watch your mouth! I don't like him. You don't know him! That guy's your uncle? It's party time! Christelle! Turn it down! It's my favorite song. Are you deaf? You two, get out of here! You're grounded. And it serves you right. I hate you! I hate you all! I'll get even. She'll be a pain in my ass all summer! You want something to drink? She's not thirsty. I came for my jacket. Ask Coco. I stole his money, Mom. I couldn't help it. Where is it? It just happened. How much was there? - What's going on? - Nothing. Keep quiet! - How much? - More of this shit? - More. - Stop it! - You can't do that. - Leave me alone. What's this crap? If you need money, say so. I shouldn't have paid him back. He's a good-for-nothing! Isn't it the truth? How stupid of me. He'll drink the money away. He's my friend. Your friend? Your friend? Over the past ten years, how much does he owe us? How much? How often did you pay for him? So Coco helps himself and I think he's entitled to. But next time, son... steal from the rich. You're a cop and you're laughing! - So? - A cop? My brother the cop? What about it? It's not funny. Eat... You never know who'll eat you. Who's going to eat us? No one, it's just an expression. I'm going to eat you up! With lots of kisses. Kisses that swallow you whole! If only your father were here... He'd be so proud of you. Especially of Coco. Still the same, Coco. Still the same asshole. Remember when Dad dumped the manure in the bar? With Bibof's father! If I had something to hide, it'd be hidden. Wrong room. I wanted something of Dad's. We know your story by heart. - What's his problem? - I'm working tomorrow. It's summertime. Have some fun. I don't like that! Will Coco be staying long? He said he'll be living at the house. Pain in the ass! Things were cool before. I like Coco. He's nice. You're crazy. He looks like he kills women. I dreamt about him the other night. We were walking in the woods. All of a sudden, Coco was behind us. He smiled, but I looked at what was in his hand. What was it? A knife. He wants to kill us. Not true! Not true! I'm telling Daddy. It was just in my dream. You know what else? He ate us. Are you okay? Wake up... It's me, Alex. I'm here. You're not alone. Too many blankets. It gives nightmares. I saw Ronnie. My friend Ronnie. Who? Christelle? - Was your dream true? - Yeah. Want to know the rest? So, Coco killed the two of us. He cut us into little pieces and put them in the refrigerator to eat later. The next day, Granny made dinner. Good meat cooked just right. They were hungry. And happy to eat together, like in the good old days. Smells good! To welcome him home, they gave Coco the place of honor. It was up to him to cut the meat. No one was worried that we weren't there. Even Granny had forgotten us, so proud was she to see her boys eating. They ate, without knowing that it was us. Except for Coco, of course. He nibbled away at the tiny bones because Granny had bought him a new set of teeth. They drank wine. It was our blood. Suddenly, Daddy started choking on a piece of meat. He swallowed it anyway. Suddenly, a little voice rang out from his tummy: "Meanie! Eating his daughters' flesh!" "Meanie! Drinking his daughters' blood!" The little voice turned into a sob. Everyone's tummies began sobbing. The sobs become enormous. Only Coco didn't feel a thing, savoring his revenge. So Daddy spat up his meat. Then what? The pieces got glued back together and Daddy killed Coco. No, not Coco! If he doesn't scare you, get me some food from the kitchen. And ask him why he's not married. Where are Daddy and Granny? They went to get my new teeth. Where are you? Run! Let go! What kind of game is this? I don't like how you look at me. You're not the only one who suffered. Oh yeah? What made you suffer? And you! You say you were in the Legion. Where are your papers? They're not in your bag. Aurélie, go on. Ask him your question. Why aren't you married? Let's go. Do you feel nauseous? She's mean, isn't she? Ronnie... I can see his eyes. Is Ronnie your friend? At the café, he paid for my lunch. He asked me questions. Why I wanted to die and all that... Why I wanted to die... Who is it? It's me. It's Alex. I have a stomachache. Hey, honey! Not in bed yet? I'm not "honey." What? I can't even have fun with my little brother now? I mean it. Either you preach or you tease. Sorry, it's because I'm dumb. I'm lousy with people. Do you have dreams at night? As you can see, I don't sleep. And when I do, it's like a black hole. I had a dream. We were kids, playing outside. Suddenly, Dad comes. He says: "I want to play with you." He falls in the grass and can't get up. He stares at us, shouting: "I want to play with you!" We don't move. We don't help him up. We just look at him. That's not a dream. It's a memory. Coco and I didn't help him up. We were scared. He was in his hospital pajamas. Mom was at work. We locked ourselves in the house. I was carrying you in my arms. We stood inside watching Dad shouting. Then he just stopped. He went into the basement. He came back out with a rifle. He whistled for Tundra and they walked off into the woods. Three days later, he still wasn't back. Mom asked me to go look for him. I found him... lying in the grass. He'd taken off his clothes. He'd put a bullet through his head and one through Tundra's. Are you okay? You're not asleep yet? Take something if your stomach's upset. I'm fine. Go back to sleep. I didn't know all the details. You were just a baby. Forget about it. Go to bed. Good night. Alex! My father's coming! You've done a good job. Let me show you something. Come here. You have to take it. It's your pay. For the work you've done. No, it's too much for me. At your age, you always need a car like that. Did you really fight in Indochina? Yes, I did. So did my father. Then he fought in Algeria. When he came back, he wasn't the same. I don't know, but... Let's not talk about such sad things. Do you have a girlfriend? You're going to impress her. - Actually, I don't have one. - You don't have a girlfriend? A handsome kid like you? Idiot... Listen. Great music. It's nice. Can you hear it? Fine as lace. Here it comes! The death bend! Let's see your new set of teeth. The girls are going to love it. - How do you like my BMW? - It sucks! It sucks? Sure! Good evening. Fucking Arab! I said no Arabs. The Starflash had a shootout. Two people died. They're sick. The Pujol Dynasty! Alex, my protégé. Meet Max. Coco, his brother. Say hi to Coco. He just bought golf shoes. Not her! She puked everywhere! - Get lost! - I know her. I know Alex, too. Pretty little baby, cute as a button. I know Coco, too... Coco the nut. Did you just escape from Mars Attacks? - Nice suit. - Hands off! - You're hot shit now. - Your ass is grass! You're still young. All these pretty boys, just for me. No one even lights my cigarette! There's one for you. I'll go tell the cops. It's that Frankie! He tried humping me on the stones. I don't care. What the fuck do I care? Coco would never have done that. Coco's a sweetie. Stop it! He's shy. You'll turn him off to women! I need a girl now! Frankie the beefcake! Here he is. We were one short. Won't you even look at me? Look at the stones. What stones? - I haven't even shown you my back. - It wasn't good on the stones? The girls are crazy today. Full moon. Forget it. - The cops will love it. - Beat it. - They'll love it. - Beat it. - The cops will love it. - Beat it! Get the fuck off me! Cut it out! Go inside, guys. I want to go inside, too. I want to go inside, too! This is great. Just look around. Not one woman! And don't come back! This is my place! Listen to that squawking! Listen to that squealing! Have yourselves some fun. So, Mr. Legionnaire, how's tricks? While walking down that long road Remember, remember The older ones walked down it Before you, before you Before you From Gabäs to Tataouine from Bel Abbes to Constantine Knapsack in the dust March on, Legionnaire! Were you in the Legion or weren't you? I was in it! I killed for France! You're lucky you're Alex's brother. Daddy! - Go to Granny. - She's sleeping. What's it like when you're dead? Daddy's tired. What's it like? Your heart stops beating. Your heart is what pumps your blood. So... your heart stops, your blood stops, and you stop breathing. So you die and get buried. Then it's all over, so long, bye-bye. Does it hurt? No, when you're dead, you're dead. It doesn't hurt. Am I going to die, too? Am I going to die, too? No. Children don't die. Will I die one time? When you're old one day, maybe. Very old, worse than Granny. Your shirt has a spot. Go back to bed, Aurélie! You're waking me up! - You're mean. - Yeah, right. Do you know where Coco is? He didn't spend the night here. He's not a baby anymore! Okay. There's a problem. Fucking asshole! Unbelievable! Don't ask how he did it. When I got here, he ran away. Once I find him, he's dead meat. He broke everything inside! The bar, chairs, mirrors! - It'll cost a fortune! - Shut up and start cleaning. Excuse me, ma'am. He wiped shit all over the walls. That sicko crapped all over! Where were you last night? He was always like that. I remember now. Remember what? You were just a baby. I'll talk to him. Hey, you, come here. I want to tell you something. We're not savages here. If you don't like a girl, just ask for another one. That's all. There's no use hitting. What do I do with a girl who has a busted nose? I have to keep my business running. Now beat it. Right, Alex? I'll do whatever you ask of me. Don't worry. We'll work things out. Granny's making me a fairy dress. Mom... I'm hungry. There's plenty of food. I saw Ronnie. He's not happy. He thinks you're fucking with me. Who's Ronnie? Eating can be noisy. I went to the zoo. I saw hippopotamuses. - They have big rear-ends. - And little feet. I saw monkeys, too. They eat lice like this... Gross! I eat lice, too. Stop looking at me. I'm not. Granny? Tac-Tac sent me. He said Marlene had something for me. Wait here. Get in the car. Are you Marlene? No, I am. Take her to Tac-Tac. - Is that all? - That's all. He has another key. Are you okay? Yes, I'm okay. What happened? It's okay, it's okay. - Tell me what happened. - It was Coco. Coco, where are you? Come out! Come out! Are you plastered? Are you okay? Look at you. - Let's swim in the river. - I have no swimsuit. - Annie will be there. - I have no swimsuit. Where's my pizza? Tell me... Did you ever fuck Annie? Come on... Back at school, you were always together... I did it once with her, that's all. She only had eyes for you and your brother. She'd feast her eyes on you. You never noticed? He's in the house. He's here. I'm sure of it. The girls! Coco's not in here? No. And knock next time. Close that window. Give me some money. I don't have any. No spare change? Get lost. Get lost! Fucking retard! You all want to drive me crazy, but you won't. Aurélie and I will pull through. We'll run away! Run away? You can't. I have to talk to you. I have to talk to you. Things aren't good. Christelle wants to leave. She can't. We're her family. Talk to her. She can't just leave her family. You know what? You know what she said? That she's going crazy. - Crazy? - It's serious. Very serious. You beat up and then you come back? How about you? - You lock her in and go out nights. - Shut up! Careful! Careful, I saw you. Yeah, I saw you. You make women bleed. Get out of here! Don't ever come back. Never again! Not tomorrow, not in 15 years. What's that noise? Nothing. Sleep. See this door? I'll tell you a secret. It leads to the basement. If you ever want to run away, use it. Are you okay? Come here! It's me, Annie. Come here! I'm not going to eat you. Come here! Get in. So? I'm not skinny-dipping. I know Bibof, not the other guy. Turn around while I put on my bathing suit. How about you? Are you skinny-dipping? Coco, are you okay? Dad... Mom? A fairy! Got a wish? Can you give me some money, Miss Fairy? As much as you can. Here. Can you give me some real money now, Miss Fairy? Real money. Yes. Close your eyes. Open your eyes. Open your hand. Thank you, Miss Fairy. I'll pay you back. Come help me in the kitchen. Go pick me some tomatoes. - How many? - A lot. When they come home, they'll be hungry. Help me set the table. This is... Good day, or good evening, rather... This is Frankie Pujol. Can I talk to the Chief? Yeah, I'm still here. Then I'll tell you. Didier Pujol killed Annie. Yeah, Coco. My brother. Granny! I know you're there, Mom. Let's play hide-and-seek. Go to your room. Mom, please... It's Coco. It's me, your son. Open for your son. Open for your son. Bitch! Let me in! Let me come inside. Why? Why? Don't cry. I'm back! Mom! Stop it! Coco, stop it! Go away. Kill me. Kill me or I'll start again. Go away. Go away. I turned you in. Go away! I'm scared. Come on. Come this way. I can't run fast. Babar's shoes aren't my size. You know... I'm in a little trouble. I did some stupid stuff. But I understand now. You're my family. I'll stay with you. Frankie doesn't want me to. You can explain to him. If you explain, I'll do whatever you want. Whatever you want. Because now... all that counts... is love. This doesn't count! It doesn't count! The weather report... I'm going windsurfing this weekend. We're almost at the village, Alex. That night, Aurélie dreamt about prehistoric beasts. They're enormous. They move towards us. They crush tractors, men and mountains. They crush everything in their way. The next day, we woke up, we packed and we left. Are you okay, Aurélie? You don't feel nauseous? You're not talking? Cat got your tongue? At school, you're going to learn to read and write. Come on, Aurélie. What's wrong? Talk to Daddy. Talk to me. What's wrong? Say something. Drive faster. You'll see, Aurélie. There's a magic mountain. We're almost there. Look! Look! There it is. Come on, Aurélie. Look! Look, Aurélie! See that? Next summer, I'll teach you to swim. And we'll play table soccer. Know what? Tomorrow, someone will knock. It'll be Mommy. You'll go buy your schoolbooks together. It'll be over soon. It'll be over. It'll be over... Translation: Andrew Litvack
