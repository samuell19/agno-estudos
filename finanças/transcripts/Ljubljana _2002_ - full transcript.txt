I've had enough of this! Someone left a note for me over the phone. Have you no clue how important this was? Why didn't you leave me the message, you idiot?! You're crazy! I left you that note! Right there by the phone! That's a lie! There was no note! Clean up that mess around the phone and you might see it. Look at you! Lying there like a butterball! Let him start paying the bills or get him out of here! It's wild! When it hits, man, you just can't believe it! That teeny weeny pill, just a molecule, you know.. Those guys bolt them down like candy. But it's unbelievable! It just nails you! Like a rocket! It hurls you around the entire hall ...10cm above ground! I danced all night! You know how I dance.. ...two minutes and back to the beer, tired out like a dog. No longer! It's like...like being blessed. It's so cool! Everybody's dancing, it's great! Only, typical, I overdid it again... My back.. I ended up lying there, everyone around me dancing wild. Gotta do something about this, I mean exercise, toning the muscles.. No connections, none of this, or that,and you can't start from zilch! But something's opening up now. They called me from Koln for an audition. No shit! -Yeah, so now just entire days...really...I'm going to make it! You know him! It's the same guy I was with in Split for that course.. Which guy? -That German... Man, you should see him play! He's the one who invited you to Koln? - Yeah, for an audition. It's wild! I could play all night long just with him... -Great! Yeah, and if the others are the same, then I'm all for it. If they are.

The babe's all moist and hot..sorry, I gotta jump on over to the station for a johnny, be right back! ...she wont wait, I'm saying! Brring, brring from down below... two cops come up and: "Turn it down to room level, the neighbors below are very upset." So I told them: "We're also very upset... Just listen to this piece!! Little bitch... -But he's cool... he told this babe to take a hike! Can you imagine? Three years with this girl and then she supposedly just happens to get pregnant? - Man, it's classic! 9 out of 10 getting married... knocked up, you know? Imagine it! Mom's and dad's, aunts and uncles, the whole mess.. ...then jamming away every day from ten to two... No crap! But the philharmonic orchestra's great! For what?..to get the flocking urge? One's up there waving away at you, and you're down there amidst a bunch of fossils... Oh, come on! - What?!...I've done it before! They're always watching the clock like hawks, waiting for their shift to end and then retirement galore! - And all this ultra-light, titanium. Forget plastic! I already told you where the money is! Farms,my boy! The less asphalt, the better. You drive up, see the old house, no dog?...you honk! Mammy comes out. Hello! How are you? Not so good. No? Why's that? The roof leaks? No problem! We'll fix it! How will you fix it? You have those government papers, certificates? But they're worthless.. You give me the papers, I give you 2000 DEM.. Mammy gets a new roof, I get her shares. He's so adorable...cause he's so into fixing things so they can fly! Don't tell me you're serious for a guy that screws toys together?! Come on!I didn't say I was getting serious.They're not just some toys. You should see it all. Stuff that should never fly... But it does! And so what, even if they are toys. That's just what I like about him... that he's still into dreaming. OK, but could you spend ten years with him, or have a kid with him? Tihi called me the other day. He wanted to go out for a drink. And? -And what?! Of course I said no! I can't go out for a drink with him! Maybe you could by now. Yeah, right! No I cant, and that's that! Even if I wanted to, I can't. How old is he now? - I think he's almost a year. But you don't know what it does to me when I see them. You know...cause with him I could have a kid. Really, I would! Why do you always have to stir up the same old shit? Let him go! The guy has a kid! It's over! Did you ever see your folks have sex? What? - Or heard them? Their room was always at the other end of the house. Thank God! Just a little more than 24 hours ago, last night at exactly 9:46 pm, or just before 6 a.m. local time, western Japan suffered a terrible earthquake, rating 7.2 on the Richter scale. The destructive earthquake was thirty times more powerful than the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The consequences are truly tragic. Let's have a look at the latest update. The worst earthquake in Japan in the last 50 years... Yes, hello? No, it's Mare.. yes, his son. No, he's not home. Sure, yeah. Yes... He'll get the message. Definitely, yes. Bye. Hi mom! How are you? Nothing... just a cold. It's been going around. No, not a virus. Yes, I'm taking care of myself. Yes. Me too. Hey, mom? You know these sales ...I saw a jacket, blue, real pretty ...only a few are left. And they're on sale.. No, they don't take checks. They'll be gone, no way! The guy set me up again and I wont get my paycheck til the 20th. You'll get that back too. I can't leave your cash with the doorman, you said so yourself. Why do you have to complicate over every shitty penny?! No, I'm not nervous... I just have a fever. This shit always happens whenever I call, always... You always say how much you love me, you miss me, and then when I ask you for something... No, you don't, no of course not... I can hear him in the back pumping you up... You know what?! You go tell that shit to your crappy boyfriend! Yes? Oh hi, it's you... just taking it easy, all day... yeah... really? That's great! I can't today, sorry, not today. Hey, let's go tomorrow? Tomorrow at 8:30 in front of the cinema. OK. Ciao! Ana...do you want some tea? - Sure. So, you're home? - I didn't feel like going today. Aren't classes mandatory? - Not really.. You know, you could clean up a bit... don't you think? Did you go to class yesterday? No. And not the day before, or Tuesday either. Actually, I haven't been yet this week. But you know that! And what about exams? Exams aren't until September.And I won't be finishing school anyway, ...cause it's stupid and a waste of time! Don't you think it would be a shame to just give it all up? I've got three years left... do you know how long that is? I'm sick of schools, classes and shit! Look, I've got this friend who had fantastic grades, among the best in the class, and his dad's the head surgeon. And what did he get?! Small-town Kranj! Please! So, it's pretty obvious that I don't stand a chance! Where will I end up? I have zilch connections, bad grades... probably some town in outer space and for that miserly pay, too! Honey, you gotta do something. You have to have a profession. Look who's talking... ...as if you haven't been getting a free ride on dad your whole life! Look mom, everything will be alright. Just trust me a little. I'll get by on my own. Name and surname. - OK, turn a little bit around..good. Hair color. Eyes. - Other direction. Lower your head.. Social security. ID number. - Lift up your arm a bit. OK. Next. The guy from our class,the one who kinda lost his sense of orientation You mean Tomaz? -Yeah. Do you think that even in his dreams... that he gets a hard-on for girls, or is it strictly just guys? And I recall how we were both crazy for the same girl in school... What a paradox! Man, do you get these guys? From dawn til dawn they're praying behind those walls, so careful not to commit sin, and all the while they're cultivating... those mala fide, little green pears into schnapps, so that later, their drinkers can be found lying dead in some ditch. Man, monks! What's up you two? - Hey, Mare! So what's happening here today? All around someone from our class Are you going to the Iggy Pop concert? Nah...leave him in the 19th century! So, what are you doing here?! This music rules here... Aah! Checking out the options? - What else! Hey. What's up? - What are you up to? It's been a while... - Happens.. So, how are things? And you? - Fine. Fine. I heard you're living with that blonde...? So what happened when... ...you never know what... Check out the graffiti - a circled A. 50's anarchy 'in' again? Who gives a shit about anarchy. That's an A for amphetamines. That's what's 'in' these days. OK, well...I'll see you around... - Yeah, definitely. See you. Katja. Hello!
