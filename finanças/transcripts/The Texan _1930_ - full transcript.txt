The Lord be with you, brother. I don't like to be pilin' work up on ya, but my pony threw a shoe. Oh, it's all right, brother, it's all right. A horse is one of the Lord's critters. I'm bound to serve him. I'll be much obliged. You're ridin' him a little hard. A little. Stranger in these parts? [man] Yeah. Do you mind if I hang my saddle over there. Anywhere you like, brother, anywhere you like. Is this your coat, sheriff? Hangin' on the peg, yes. Do you mind if I hang your coat over my saddle so nobody will steal it? [sheriff] Go right ahead, but it won't be stole. It's a good book you're reading. [sheriff] Good for everybody, I hope you'll carry one yourself. No, not just now. I'm traveling light. Another holdup, I see. [sheriff] Just another unbelievin' sinner temptin' the Lord's wrath. Well, looks like he done pretty good so far. His time is not yet. His day of sorrow is comin'. I don't reckon it'd be safe for this Llano Kid to ride into your territories. The Lord watches with me. That bandit rides my way, the Lord'll deliver him into my arms. Must be sort of comfortin' to have the Almighty for your deputy. I don't fancy that kind of jokin', stranger. If the Lord's on my side, it's because I'm on his side. I don't tolerate blasphemin' any more than I do thievin' and killin'. So I noticed, sheriff. How soon my pony be ready? Maybe an hour. Well, it'll take me an hour to wean my thirst. Good book says, "Wine is a mocker, and strong drink is raging." So I hear, but liquor and cards kind of agree with me. Wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction. Yeah, well, so long, sheriff. So long, brother. ♪ Here the call O, put your armor on ♪ ♪ Rest the Spirit's mighty sword ♪ Whiskey! [singing in Spanish] [man] Two pair's all I got. [man 2 laughing] [singing in Spanish] Ah, is there no one in this town who can play poker? [laughs] Come back again, amigo. When you get more money, I'll give you lesson. [laughs] [whistling] Can you beat fours? [man 2] Papi... Tens? Easy, my friend, easy. Four aces. [laughing] [man 3] Just a minute. While you was dealin' yourself four aces, you got a little mixed up and dealt me one too. Stick 'em up! Line up against that bar. Turn around! [man] Boys, the Llano Kid! [people shouting] [guns firing] Let me arrest you, brother. I'll see that you get a fair trial. [Llano Kid] I ain't riskin' my neck with 12 of that card shark's friends on the jury. All right, brother, run away then. But remember, you can hide from the eyes of men, but you can't hide from the eyes of the Lord. I don't reckon he's got much time to look my way. You'll pay for this, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. What's that, an Injun curse? You mean well, sheriff, and I sure hate to cheat you out of that $500 reward. [sheriff] The Llano Kid. Your chief deputy didn't do you much good that time, did he, sheriff? He will. The time is not yet, but He'll lead me to you wherever you are. Well, so long, brother. [train whistling] [bell clanging] [train clacking] Sorry, stranger. [people chattering] Ticket. Your ticket. How many you want for one train ride? Well, I'm a... I stuck it right in there. Look in your pockets. I know it ain't there. Then look for some cash unless you want to get out and walk. Walk? All the way to Galveston? -Galveston? -Yeah. With him? No, he must have got on at... Did he have a ticket to Galveston? In his hat. Hey, you. Wake up, you! Hey, where did you get your ticket to Galveston? [speaking in Spanish] What did he say? He says he hopes I'll have a pleasant trip. Not without a ticket. Look again, and I'll be back. Lucky for you you can't talk English, you long-legged lyin', thievin' horse thief. I never seen a fat man yet that didn't talk too much. Now you stole my ticket! Sit down, stranger, that was my ticket. -You...! -My ticket, wasn't it? Yeah, reckon I was mistaken. [Llano Kid] All right, stranger, I accept your apology. Hey, I ain't just curious, mister, but if you don't mind tellin' me, where are you headed? You oughta know. You bought my ticket. I mean, after Galveston. Why? Well, if you're as gun-lovin' as you look, maybe I'll buy you another ticket. Where to? Hey. How'd you like a good drink of liquor? I'm sure glad I didn't have to shoot you, mister. [laughs] Thacker's my name, Abner J. Thacker. Say, go easy. That's powerful strong. Now I know you're the hombreI'm lookin' for. You don't say. Yeah, see... That platform's more private. Hey... How'd you like to take a nice trip to South America? What for? Well, you look kind of peaked. I thought maybe you were travelin' for your health. I figured you'd listen to a proposition for makin' a whole heap of easy money, wouldn't ya? How 'bout it? Keep right on talkin'. I'll stop ya if you go wrong. Well, with your heavy sunburn, you look Spanish, you talk Spanish, and you got some takin' Spanish ways. I've been took for Spanish before. But what's your game? Well, you're the right age, and any mother would be proud of such a big fine-lookin' son like you. I don't know much about mothers. Mine died before I had a chance to get acquainted with her. Suppose I was to tell you that your ma is still alive and hog-rich too. What? Here, read how much she wants you home. One thousand dollars is only chicken feed. But we ain't after chicken feed. I said she was hog-rich, didn't I? Well, maybe that is my ma after all. [laughs] I reckon this ain't the first time that somebody's offered a reward for information concerning your whereabouts, eh? [laughs] Let me see your left arm. That kid, and only one mark of identification. And it was tattooed right there. A beautiful mermaid ridin' on the spine of a sea serpent. [wind wailing] Sure has healed up nice, sonny. Say, how'd a ten-year-old kid get tattooed like this? He wasn't born thataway, was he? That's how come he run away. He got a sailor to tattoo him. The old lady raised such Cain that he stowed away on a fruit boat bound for the States. Won't it take more than that to fool a lovin' mother about her own brat? She ain't see him for 15 years. Any Spanish-looking hombre your age with that tattoo could fool her. Especially an innocent-lookin' maverick like you. [laughing] Well, I'd feel better if this was just a plain straight-up shootin' affair. This is the only way we can find out where she's got her money hid away. She's such a fool, she'd tell a perfect stranger? Stranger? Listen, sonny, you were her only child. That's why she's been storing up gold all these years, just to give it to her darling Enrique if he'll only come back home. This playacting don't set well on my stomach. And all them fool questions she's gonna ask me. [Abner] Ain't I teachin' you everything about the family and the servants and the town? Hey, that old lady's got confidence in me. I've known her for years. Well, if she can swallow you whole, I reckon she won't choke on me. Well, we're gonna do some swallowin' too, $50,000 worth. Go on, get busy practicing your manners. [Llano Kid] Looks kind of unhappy, don't she? All your fault. You had no business running away from home. What'll she do when she sees me? Oh, it won't be so bad. She'll kiss ya some and hug ya some and cry over you some. Not out before everybody. Ah, you know how affectionate them Spanish is. She'll probably be sittin' on the dock, waitin'. Well, I ain't broke to women like her. The only kind I know, you don't have to play act with. You don't need no manners. I'm learnin' you manners, ain't I? Go on now, start your practicing. My little mother of the silver hair. After all these years, your Enrique... Say, your ma calls you Quico for short. Your Enrique of the sorrowed heart has come back home for you. Now go on, in Spanish. [speaking in Spanish] Say, you know, she ain't such a bad-lookin' old heifer at that. [Abner laughs] [bell clanging] [bells ringing] [indistinct chattering] All right, you take that. There we are. Well, what do you think of your old hometown? Filled up so I can't hardly recognize it. That's the first time church bells every rung for me. It's right complimentin'. Oh, them ain't for you. Them's for the ship. Why, the whole town's in town at the dock to watch it come in. You know, like the old 5:15 back in Texas. [indistinct shouting] Seen my ma yet? There's her carriage. I see Pasquale. Who's Pasquale? Somebody else I gotta kiss? No, the coachman. You remember. [speaking in Spanish] [woman speaking in Spanish] Wait up, Pasquale. [speaking in Spanish] [Abner] Well, I'll be... Senorita. Senorita... [speaking in Spanish] Who is she? Do I kiss her? If you remember me, Quico, yes. If you do not remember, do as you wish. Sure, he remembers. Now, why must you play jokes on your cousin, your dear cousin, SenoritaConsuelo? See, ma'am, I wasn't exactly expecting ya. Yeah, I told 'em you went to school in England. We didn't know you was back. I had to return, the senoraneeded me. Oh, how is the dear senora. Enrique's been powerful anxious about her. She is not well. That is why she do not meet you here. Well, I'm sure sorry to hear that. Your letter was such a shock but a shock of joy. She will be so happy to see you, Quico. Come, come. Well, you're kind of cramped in here. I'll just set up here. [speaking in Spanish] Dona Marguerita will wish to be alone when they meet. But... but Thacker... It is better, Don Quico. [people chattering] Well, all right, I'll get my gripsack. Quick, who's the fat one? -That's the duenna. -The what? Duenna, a chaperone. What's that? Kind of a sheepdog to keep wolves away from the lambs. Do I have to kiss her too? Blazes, no, don't pay no attention to her. Come on, Quico. [people chattering] [speaking in Spanish] Dona Marguerita wish you to call tonight. She will reward you. [people chattering] Don't forget your manners to your ma! Oh, really, Dona Marguerita, he was wild but not bad, I think. SenorThacker write that he has grown very tall, like you English. Like his father, he grew up very tall and so straight. But no matter how tall Quico have grown, I know he's still a little boy at heart, full of tricks. Whenever I scold him, he always want to run away. [laughs] [horse hoofs thudding] [both speaking in Spanish] [people chattering in Spanish] He is home. My Quico is home! Please try not to excite yourself. All of these years, I wait for this day. Now I am afraid. What if he no longer love me? Please, Dona Marguerita. Oh, it has been so long, so long. What if he do not remember me? Oh, I must... I must be brave. I must not let him see my tears. You mustn't do that, ma'am. I punish you. You do not forgive. Well, that's quite all right, ma'am. No, you do not love me. You do not take me in your arms. Oh, my son, my son. [speaking in Spanish] Stand up. Stand up. Let me look at you. How tall you are, just like your father. The same clear eyes, the same bone mark. And so handsome, so handsome. Oh, Dona Marguerita. Nay, it is nothing. All right, nothing to fear. My son, hold me in his arm. And all of these years, you have been cowboy in Texas? Mostly cowboy, mostly Texas. Strange we do not find you before. Well, I never camped long in one place. [Marguerita] No, why? Kind of healthier moving about. Was it not wise to take such good care for his health? Why did you change your name, Quico? Well, them cowboys did that for me. What did they call you? Oh, a lot of things. [both speaking in Spanish] He has come for his reward. You must forgive his terrible customs. He have a good heart. He was once the agent of your father. Well, well, well. Evenin', senora, evenin', senorita. I am glad to see you, Mr. Thacker. Well, didn't I tell ya I'd find him? What I say I'll do, I do. I am grateful beyond words. Senora,my pleasure at seein' him here in the bosom of his family is beyond all words too. Hm, yes, ma'am. When I see a lady grievin' her heart out, I don't stop at nothin'. [laughs] Only hope he don't prove disappointin'. Disappoint me, my son? Never. He will always be the joy of my life. Well, I calculated he'd be the joy of somebody's life. [laughs] You may sit down, please. For you we have something. Come. Well, senorita, what do you think of that growed-up cousin of yours, eh? He has changed. Sure, he has. Suppose you'd been knockin' around with Texas cowboys for 15 years. Wouldn't you have been changed? Sure. [key clicking] All them bags gold? Yes, you did not know? That is nice surprise. You are pleased, no? The one on top is for SenorThacker. [key clicking] Oh, no, they are yours now, my son. When I first come down to South America, I was just as raw as Enrique is now. Me and my ma are sure are grateful to ya. And it goes a lot deeper than just this bag of gold. Oh, thank you, Don Enrique. Thank you, senora.[laughs] I'm taking this 'cause I know you'll feel hurt if I don't. But I want you to know one thing, what I done was a labor of love. There ain't nobody here that's any happier than me the way things is comin' out. [laughs] No, siree, Bob. Why, would you believe it if I...? If you don't mind, I'll just bite into one of them there bananas. Say, you wouldn't believe it to look at me, but you know, I was so excited about this reunion, well, I couldn't eat no supper, no. I always says, eat plenty of fruit and keep the doctors away. [laughs] This way, senor,do you know when I first come to this country, I had the meanest case of rheumatism you ever seen, yes, sir. The pill doctor told me. He says, "Hey, look here." Maybe I better see you to the gate. Huh? Oh, yeah. Sure, sure, sure. Yeah. Sure. Well, as you folks say down here, don't wear red near a bull unless he's colorblind. [laughing] [speaking in Spanish] [footsteps tapping] You are happy? [laughs] Do I have to say it. But he is so... so strange, so... American. Oh, but what does it matter. Even if I have to learn to know him all over again, I have him back. That is what makes me so happy. My son is once more my own. Oh, don't be a fool. I tell ya, we couldn't do it. Sure, we can. We can wait till they're all asleep. I can get the gold, and we can hide out till the next boat. Hide out where? With only swamps on the coast and pampas inland, I tell ya, there ain't no way for us to get away from this town except on the boat that we came in on. And that won't be back for two months. Well, I can't stand this for no two months. Stand what? Living off the fat of the land? That old lady keeps hugging and kissing me. [laughs] Well, she ought to get somethin' for all that gold. Well, I ain't used to bein' pawed over. I bet you don't mind bein' pawed over by Consuelo. I'm still sayin' you can be back here by midnight with some horses. Say, listen, we settled this on the boat. Getting that gold is only half of it. Wait till you ride over this ranch tomorrow. You'll see the finest herd of cattle you ever set eyes on. And in two months' time, it'll bring $25,000 or more for you and me to split. That gold in the house is enough for me. I ain't no hog. Well, look here, maybe you're satisfied to get that gold. But I'm after a big enough haul to take it easy for the rest of my life, and I want that cattle money, savvy? I ain't so sure. Now let me tell you something, sonny. If you think I'm gonna let you spoil my plans, you're mighty mistaken. You're gonna sell that herd, and you're gonna stay right here until that boat comes back in, Mr. Llano Kid. Hm, didn't think I knowed who you was, did ya, huh? Thought I was a greenhorn, eh? Well, I seen how you dodged daylight in Galveston. Yeah, and I looked you up. And I know all about you and that racket of yours. I even know why you was in such an all-fire hurry the night we met. Wanted, dead or alive, eh? There's an American consul in this town, savvy? Now go on in and comfort your little mother with the silver hair and stop your bellyachin'. Hey, tie it on, wake up! [driver speaking in Spanish] Sunday, the padre will say a mass of thanksgiving to celebrate his return. Oh, we have make fine plans for you, my son. We give a gay fiesta and all the beautiful senoritaswill be there. You shall see. We shall give you a welcome as befit your father's son. Oh! Oh, I am so tired. So much excitement in one day. [speaking in Spanish] You will take me to my room, yes? [moans] Your arm is strong. [laughs] It is. I will send him back to you. You remember? You can well be proud of your father, my son. He live without reproach and die without fear. You remember what it mean, my son? Well, well, it's sort of hazy like. [Marguerita] Honorable death is better than base life. [speaking in Spanish] Oh, you have make me so happy. Now we must say good night. Good night, Mamacita. Don Enrique. [speaking in Spanish] I'll sure be glad when tomorrow comes along so I can swing up into a saddle and have the feel of a horse under me again. What's the matter, did I say something wrong? No. It is just I am so happy. It is your mother, Quico. She is like someone born all over again. She has not many years to live, and you must try to make them happy. Promise me you will always be kind to her, that you will never, never hurt her again. Well, I... Promise me, Quico. I... I'll do all I can. Now, we must talk of your future. Let us see what things of importance you have forget in all these years. Many accomplishments are expected of a young man in your position. You can sing? Me, sing? No? Well, I used to hum a little to my pony. But I wouldn't call it singing. [laughs] I will teach you. But you can dance, yes? Well, my feet kind of get all tangled up. Here you must dance with all the beautiful senoritas. Well, I never was much of a ladies' man. That also I will teach you. Here this is much gay life, and you are important man now. You will go into the affairs of the consul. Your father was governor once. Maybe you will be too. Me, governor? Why not? And then, someday, you will marry. Do I have to do that, too? But yes, the family name must always live. And nothing would please Dona Marguerita more than a grandchild. Why... [laughs] Why, I reckon I'll be pretty busy lookin' after the ranch. Maybe you leave your heart in Texas? No, I've still got it with me. There is no pretty American girl to return to? -[man singing in Spanish] -Oh. [laughs] That is very nice. For all the beautiful senoritas. [man continues singing in Spanish] Right pretty, ain't it? What man could keep from singing on a night like this? And what woman could keep believing? [singing in Spanish continues] ♪ Was in the merry month of May ♪ ♪ I started for Texas, far away ♪ ♪ I left my darling girl behind ♪ ♪ She said her heart was always mine ♪ [speaking in Spanish] -Chelito! -Quico. [laughs] You do that so much better now. Mighty nice of you to come and meet me. I was afraid you might run away. Not after I knew you were here. You are glad to see me again? Sort of reading my mind, ain't you? [speaking in Spanish] Look out, here comes the jealous mother-in-law. [woman speaking in Spanish] [both laughing] How's my ma, all right? Counting the hours until she see you. The business with the cattle, she was good? Kind of disappointing. Oh, the cattle did not bring much money? Plenty. Oh, that is wonderful! The money part is, but I didn't get much fun out of it. I couldn't keep my mind on the cattle. No, what did you keep your mind on? I'll give you one guess. You mean me? First time in my life I ever knowed there was such a feelin'. You like it, that feeling? Like it? It makes me wonder what a man ever wants with liquor. It's a fact, Chelito. Getting drunk on your own feelings is a happy way of... What is it, Quico? Quico? It's nothin'. You look as if you had seen a ghost. Why, it is only the ship from America, the one you came on, back here again. You start to tell me, Quico, what was it? I'm listening. Nothing. Don't you remember? About your feelings? It slipped my mind. I know, it is that ship. It does make you want to go away. No. We'd better get going. [shouting in Spanish] [dog barking] My son, my son. It is almost worthwhile having you go away for the great joy to see you return. The trip has done you good. That's enough to explain it. [laughs] You are glad to be home, yes? Everything is all right, yes? Yes. Why, what is the matter? You are well, my son? Oh, I reckon I'm just a little bit tired. Of course, how selfish of us to keep you here. You go right upstairs. Take a nice warm bath and rest before supper, yes? I think I'd better stow this gold away. Oh, there is no hurry. I'd like to get it off my mind. I have big surprise for him. You wonder why I go so many times to see the good wife of the American consul. Well, she have teached me how to make all those Americans things Quico say he love to eat. Doughnuts. Beautiful! Pickles. Apple pie. Magnifico. Will he not be proud of his mother when he see. What a joy to see him eat every crumb. Oh, he's coming, he's coming. Here, cover, cover. He must not see. We must surprise him. Oh, we have a big surprise for you. You are very hungry, yes? No. Oh, why, sure. Sure, I'm hungry. I was only fooling. I haven't eaten since morning. [laughs] Oh, you joke with your mother. You come right upstairs. You think you are such a serious grownup man, because you are so tall, don't you? [laughs] You don't fool Mother. The tallness is all on the outside. But on the inside, you're just the same sweet, nice, funny little boy. Yes. [singing in Spanish] What is it? That song, I was tryin' to recollect where I heard it before. Your own song you forget? I made it up for you myself when you were little baby. You used to sing it all the time. [laughs] Oh, that terrible memory of yours. Now, you go to your room, dress for supper and don't forget you are very hungry. [singing in Spanish] [Dona humming softly] [singing in Spanish] [laughing] [Llano Kid] Just a minute. While you was dealin' yourself four aces, you got a little mixed up and dealt me one too. [Marguerita humming] Quico? Quico? Quico! [upbeat music] [people chattering, laughing] Well, I... Just don't sail without me and my partner now. I'm sailing with the tide at 4:00 in the morning. We'll be aboard at 2:00, you can count on us. [people chattering] Hello, good evening. Hey, that was the captain of our ship you just passed. It's all fixed. I got passage for two, and we sail at 4:00. I want to see you, private. Sure, right this way, Don Enrique Granadas-Ibarra. Gangway. Hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here to let me know you was back. I'm watching you all the time, sonny. [laughs] I ain't taking no chances. How was that cattle break. Little better than 25,000. That's the ticket. That should be 80,000 for you and me to split. Huh, now admit it. You was a crazy cuss for thinkin' we would pull freight when you first come down here. Hey, didn't I tell ya I knowed what I was doin'. Now, listen, sonny... Now you listen, I got some bad news for you. I'm callin' our deal off. Huh? I just found out somethin' that changed my mind about our whole proposition. I'm declaring myself out. And you too. You don't say so. Declarin' me out, are ya? [laughs] Takin' a mighty lot for granted, ain't ya? Maybe, but I ain't doin' anything to hurt that old lady. And I ain't lettin' you hurt her neither. [laughing] You better laugh less and listen more. She's the only human being that ever cared whether I was fed or hungry or dead or alive. Ain't there some sheriffs in Texas who'd care whether you was dead or alive? Ah, livin' off the fat of the land's gone to your head, ain't it? Gettin' sweet and sentimental about that old woman, are ya? Suppose I was to tell her just who you are? Why, then I'd have to let the people of this town know that you took $1,000 from one of their best citizens for passin' off a fake son. Oh, now, listen, son, think of me a little. Haven't I played fair with you? Ain't no use to argue. Oh, you got too much good common horse sense to go away and leave all that gold behind. I ain't goin' away. I'm stayin'. I ain't been able to figure out why. But that old lady loves me just like I was her own son. She almost died when he run away. She wouldn't pull through a second time, so I'm stayin'. So that's it, eh? You count me out, so's you can stay here and get it all to yourself. Well, that don't go well with me, you dirty, cheatin', yellow-livered coyote, you! I reckon the American consul will mighty glad to know where he can put his hands on the Llano Kid. Listen, I left Texas on account of one killin'. I can just as easy leave here on account of another. I got just one more thing to say to you. There ain't no more Llano Kid. From now on, it's Don Enrique Granadas-Ibarra. And it ain't on account of that gold, neither. It's on account of that old lady. Because the man I killed back in Texas had one of these tattooed on his left arm. Hey! Hey, come on, stop it! Oh, I know you want 100 pesos, all right. But how bad do you want it? -Now, look... -No, the knife won't do it. -Take a gun. -That's a good idea. You got five or six men that would like to mix pesos with excitement? There's your crew. All right, listen. Tonight... [horse hooves thudding] Quico! I was so afraid. The boat... I thought you had gone forever. What is it, Quico? I've got something to tell you that we must never let Dona... Dona Marguerita know. You see, I... Oh, I did not tell you, your friend, Mr. Brown from Texas, he's been waiting for you. I reckon you're right glad to see me. Yes, brother, I'm always glad to see whatever the Lord opens my eyes on. Excuse me, please. I will tell Dona Marguerita. I'll take that gun of yours, young fella. Listen, sheriff, let me... Put up your hands! I told you the Lord would lead me to ya, didn't I, brother? He couldn't have picked a worse time for it. I picked up your trail in Galveston. The captain of that ship is a friend of mine. And he's sailing back at 4:00 in the morning. You ready to travel? You seen the old lady yet? Only the girl. Listen, sheriff, since that night in your blacksmith shop, I've rode a mighty strange trail. I've got to tell you something, and you've got to believe me. -But... -'Taint no use. Now quit arguing. All right, then, sheriff. Then do just one thing for me. Don't spoil her happiness tonight. Wait till they've gone to bed before you take me away. All right, but don't try none of your tricks on me. I'll be watchin'. Quico? Be careful what you say. My son, where have you been? I've been so worried. Just to town on a little business. Oh, Quico, you gave me such a fright. Don't ever do this again without first telling me. I won't, Mamacita. Oh, this is a friend of mine from Texas, Mr. Brown. The Lord be with you, sister. Oh, you will honor with us by staying to supper, Mr. Brown? Thank you. I reckon I will. You will sit here, please, Mr. Brown. For what we are about to receive, may the Lord make us truly thankful, amen. Oh, you would like to know what is there, yes? That is my surprise for your American appetite. You like, yes? Hm, just what I've been wishin' for, pickles, pie and donuts. Then eat all of it, every crumb. It is good, yes? The best I ever ate, aren't they, Mr. Brown? Whatever the Lord sets in my mouth, I'm thankful to chew. To come such a long way, you must want to see my son very much. Yes, I surely do. You see, I had to leave Texas in such a hurry that I had to leave some important business unfinished. [Marguerita] And you have come to help him finish it? That is very kind. Whatever the Lord wills, I try to do. My son is very important man in Texas. He is very well known, yes. He's mighty well known. And Texas, she would like to have him back, yes? Yes, Texas would be mighty glad to get him back. Never will she get him back. He was lost to me for years, but never will he leave me again, no? -No. -No. You are married, mister? [sheriff] Yes, ma'am. You have a son? No, the Lord ain't seen fit to bless me with no offspring. I feel for you. You are missing greatest joy in life. If you had a son, you would know what it mean to me to have my own boy back again after all these unhappy years. I knew you would not be hungry. Now listen, you go around the corral. If they see us, you fellas keep 'em busy while me and Henry get in the house for the money. [man] We understand. Now don't take any chances. Shoot and shoot to kill. But I do not understand, what is the hole for? You cannot eat it. [all laughing] [speaking in Spanish] Excuse me, please. [speaking in Spanish] [speaking in Spanish] Just a little mix-up at the corral. Would you excuse me, please, Mother? Yes, but do not be too long, my son. I won't. You're fond of horses, Mr. Brown. Maybe you'd like to come along. I kinda think I would. Excuse me, miss. [both speaking in Spanish] Listen, sheriff, Thacker's coming after that gold, and he's trying to take us by surprise. Don't leave me like this. Let me have my gun. You fooled me once, young fella, but you ain't gonna fool me again. The Almighty will never forgive you, sheriff, if you leave these women to be robbed and maybe murdered. I'll take my chances with the Almighty, but I ain't takin' none with you. All right, then, follow me and see if I'm lyin'. Well? See that? Still I don't see nothin'... [guns firing] Get the Philistine, son. Smite 'em, hip and thigh. [both speaking in Spanish] -No. -They must go. They must go. Smite the thieves and may the dust destroy them! -Quiet, dear, quiet. -Where's my boy? Came in through the other door, after that, dunno. -Oh! -Darling. [indistinct chattering] [indistinct shouting] -[speaking in Spanish] -Quiet, dear. I reckon you'll be wanting this back now. Did he get ya? Not so bad. I'll still be able to make that boat with ya. [speaking in Spanish] It's all right, Mamacita. Just a little hole in the shoulder. Come, let's get you upstairs, quick. No, I will send Sixto to the town at once for doctor. You know, there is one thing I will never cease to marvel at. Our maker moves in mysterious ways, His wonders to perform. What do you mean? Well, ma'am, Don Enrique didn't tell you that I really came down here to hunt for a man named the Llano Kid. Wanted in Texas, dead or alive. And there he lies, ma'am. Deader than a doornail. Are you sure you recognize him, sheriff? The state of Texas ain't as wise as the Almighty. There's more than one way of paying an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. I'll go and get some things to patch you up till the doctor gets here. There's something I've been trying to tell you. And you've got to listen to me. No, no, my dear. Not now. Later, if you wish, I will listen. Maybe you will find out after all, there is nothing to tell. People see only what they want to see. Your mother, she want to see no difference between you and her little Quico. So she see none. Me, I want to see a little difference, so maybe, right away, I see it. [gentle music]
