I got the feeling. Baby, baby, I got the feeling. You don't know what you do to me. People are heavy down in misery. Hey. Love. All right. Ow. Ah. I got the feeling, all right. Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby. Baby, baby, I got the feeling baby. Baby, sometimes I'm up. Sometimes I'm down. My heart, I'm around the town. I'm level with the ground. Baby. I said level with the ground. Ah. I'm 12 years old. It's the house where we grew up. It's the 4th of July. And I'm waiting for the fireworks. Dad. Dad. Our father left that night. He never came back. The fireworks were so beautiful. My sisters and I saw them as a sign. We could do anything, everything, if we stayed together. But when it came, we weren't ready. We were so not ready. God. Watch it lady. It's a disaster. Enid's still on book. And the lighting guy says that none of her marks are going to work. Because, she's, like, six inches shorter than Alexandra. And the drama critic from the New York Times is coming. Yes. We've been working him for weeks. And did I mention that our electrical is not up to code. And there is a fire marshal and inspection at this very moment? Is he good looking? Look, we'll do anything you want. I can sleep here. At the crack of dawn, we'll work together. We'll fix it. I think I've got to get an article written about how you make this city safe. Because you're the one, let me tell you. I've got a friend at The Times. I can't let you open, sorry. Look, I'm begging you. Why don't you stay and see the play, on me, of course. Hope you mean that literally. Because that's about the only place left to sit. You're a riot, Michael. I've got major celebs coming tonight. OK? Jen, Jen, we have to cut all the references to curly hair. Here because it... it's... it's not working. It's just not working. I can't do it. Oh, my God. I'm going to faint. Oh, you are so beautiful. Can I tell you how stunning you are up there? No. There is no one else for this part but you. No, it's... Jen, I need more time. Really I do. I'm freaking out. I know, OK, OK. Don't freak out. I want you to just look into Jack's eyes. Oh, God, you two are so hot together. Just love him. He's your anchor. All you have to do is pull him in. OK, th... Can I get a banana? Can we get a banana here? Banana. Lay it on me. OK. This lighting guy is about to walk, OK? He can't get our fabulous new director to go over the lighting cues. So he wants you to talk him through a refocus. But of course, first he wants to have a... Good show. Thanks. Jen. She was really annoying. Why was my eight-year-old sister locked in the bedroom listening to Frank Sinatra albums when she could have been out on the football field taking orders from me? But, eventually she stopped being annoying. And she st... she... she became amazing. She inspires me. Someday I'm going to write about her. I've always wanted to write about her. Hey, bud. Did you like it? I liked parts. I really liked other parts. All right, so you didn't like it. Scott? I thought it was really great, Jen. What did you think Meredith? I thought Jack was terrible. I know, but what did you think? I think he should be so lucky to get you. Just go for it. No, stop it already. We're just friends. We like to hang out. Come on, Kitty, let's go. Let's go. We were young. And we were all gonna live forever. For you are the lover I have waited for. You're the mate, fate had me created for. And every time your lips meet mine. Baby, down and down I go. Round and round I go. Can we talk about Jack? - No rush. - Listen. - What? - I know that I'm pretty. But I'm not the right kind of pretty for him. Oh, God. Do you know what I'm saying? Um, no. What is the right kind of pretty for Jack. I don't know, like, maybe Nina. Oh, hopes. Oh, God. I's so easy for you to say. You're both married. Oh, Jenifer please. I am so sick of this. It is not so bleak out there. I think I'm spending too much time in that little office. What are you... It's the hottest office in New York. Yeah, 95 degrees and the paint is chipping. I think I have asbestos poisoning. You do not have asbestosis poisoning. That's crazy. I don't know though. I've just been so tired lately. Oh. Why don't you come up this weekend? Yeah, and call Jack. You'll fee better. - Would you not call him? Ah. What? The baby. Oh. She's kicking. This is the thing about my big sister. She has the most strength and grace and beauty. Valerie, Jenifer, and I are very close. It's like we're one person. It doesn't leave your thoughts. You can't juggle. I can't juggle. I mean my mother... she goes to the movies with her friends. I can't imagine. There's so much to do. Anyways, I'm getting off the subject. Um, I still think we're going to get out of this. Come on. Come on. Breathe Breathe through the contractions. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. OK, I'm here. Breathe. Breathe through the contractions. Breathe. Now we can be begin. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Shut up. Shut up. Let's talk about... talk about something else. Ah. How about them Nicks? Mom. It's a girl. Her name is Jane, 6 pounds 4 ounces. Ah. I know. It was amazing. You should have seen it. No, what would I have done in there? You girls know what to do. Well, Meredith, all of us, we wanted to be there. I can't believe it. My baby's had another baby. You wanna come see? She's not ready for visitors. You're her mother. Put that out. Of course I stopped smoking through all this. How could you not? I've learned so much from Jenifer, from all my daughters. Three sisters, one heart. She has true courage and true grit, true grit, Jenifer. We had this deal. When she won her first award, she'd say I owe it all to my mother. But the funny thing is I feel like I should be saying that about her. Did I mention I had three properties in escrow? Oh, Mom, that's great. I'm sure they'll fall through. Oh, maybe not. Maybe they'll just... I don't know why people assume that selling real estate is easy. It isn't. It's a lot of hard work for not a lot of lira. Mm. Hm. You know my friend Jack, the one who was the lead in the Chelsea. Mm-mm. I think I kind of like him. I mean, like more than a friend. That's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard. That's really supportive. I just want you to be happy. My point exactly. You can do a lot better than that Jim. You're right. Brad Pitt is stalking me. How am I going to let him down easy? Your lack of self-confidence concerns me, Jenifer. I don't know where you get it from. They say it's genetic. Oh, oh, gosh. I'm sorry. Ah, it's just water. Explain that not to my 2 o'clock customer. I've been knocking things over lately and falling a lot. What you need is a soup to nuts physical. Why don't you come home, quit your job, live with your mother? Mm. Feeling better already. I love you, Jenifer. Love you too, Ma. Can we pick up the pace here? You know, mother is going through a really hard time right now. What else is new? Hey, we came here to work, not talk about mother. Kick it. What's up with you? I know you're not exactly a triathlete, but... Oh, it's getting... look at that. Look at my arm. That's lactic acid. That doesn't sound good. Your muscles are tired. You're fine. Ah. Ten more. Come on, you're doing great. I don't see you doing any, Mary. That's because I already finished sit ups and running. Typical. Come on. Huh. You got it. You got it. God, I can't. Sure you can. Just breathe. Oh, I don't know what's wrong with me. Don't get me started. Hey, you're starting today, right? Starting what? Oh, that stupid idea I had for that play last year. Oh, the thing about the mother and the daughter. That's a really great idea. Yeah, it's genius. You gotta write two hours a day. If I've got time. Make time. There's always time, one hour. What's with these diversionary tactics? Come on. You got 10 more. Whoa. Then can we have breakfast? That's the whole point. Ah. oh. Ouch. Ah. Oh, my God. I can't believe this. This is incredible. Oh. Oh. Michael. You gotta stop throwing yourself surprise parties. Are you kidding? This is the best recurring role I've ever gotten. When your birthday is July 4th, you're gonna make your own fireworks. Own fireworks. Oh, carpe Jack, babes. Do it or I will. Eh, you're right. Forget it. You two don't have anything in common. Sure we do. We both think he's gorgeous. Jenifer, go. Go up to him. Just ask him to dance. Oh... we're just friends. Get over there right now. No way. No way. If you don't do it, I will. Do you want to dance? OK. Come on. Have you ever seen The Way We Were? That's kind of like a chick movie, isn't it? A chick movie? Like Robert Redford would be in a chick movie? Oh, I thought that, you know... I was kidding. I was so kidding. That movie kind of reminds me of us. You're Robert Redford and I'm James Woods. I don't think so. The music plays when you display your heart for me to see. I had a beer and now out here you're calling out for me. And I hope that I don't fall in love with you. Now the room is crowded with people everywhere. And I wonder should I offer you a chair. You want to get out of here? Sure, if you want to. Come on. I know there's a word for this. I know there's a word for the way I'm feeling. I know there's a word for this. I know it and it's on the tip of my tongue. But it won't go any further. I know there's a word for this. What's this going to do to our friendship? Who cares about our friendship. Dictionary. And when I find what it is. Jen? Well, hi. Hi. Are you coming out? Come on. I got to go, Jenny. Let's... let's a bite to eat or something. Can we get together later? No, I can't. I got to go back to L.A. today. remember that callback? Can I see you before I leave? Look, why don't I just call you later? OK, fine. But if I wear the dress won't it look like I'm trying too hard? Wait a minute, Valerie, hold on. Let me conference in Meredith. Hey, Meredith. No. I won't be more than 15 minutes late. I promise. I'm telling you, he's the nicest guy in Peter's office. He seems really stable. Oh, that's a ringing endorsement. Oh, I feel really good about this one. Yeah, you know what? I'm not going. You're going. She missed Jack. You miss Jack. And I right? - Call him. He's in L.A. Yeah, but? Anyway, I hate blind dates You've never even been on a blind date. Just try it. I'm going to have a shot of vodka. - Don't do that. - No, don't do that. Let go. It's my ball. - All right, gotta go. OK. Have a good time. Taxi? Hey, how you doing? Who goes there? Um, your date. Hey, I'm just on long distance. I'll buzz you up. Fifth floor. I hope they fixed the elevator. Oh, she's here. Yeah, I gotta go. OK, bye. Hi. Hi. Um, I'm really sorry. The elevator must still be out. I've ah been working out a lot, probably too much, huh? Um, can I get you something before we go? Yeah, like a towel, some Gatorade, an oxygen tank. No, maybe just a towel. I mean, I wasn't just a little sweaty. I was, like, drenched . You were drenched. Yeah, like I said, I was hanging on to the banister and literally pulling myself up the steps. Was there an elevator? So, you think it's all in my head? Do you think it's all in your head? I've gotta tell you, Ms. Estess, it's not all in your head. The results from the CAT scan, MRI, all of it are normal. Your head's fine. How can it all be in my head when my thighs are actually twitching? How are they twitching? I don't know. A twitch is a twitch. You're an M.D. I am. Do you think you might want to take a look? Do you wanted me to take a look? I'm going to run this one last test. All right, I can practically guarantee negative results. OK, which is a positive thing. Where are you going to put those? Everywhere there's a muscle head to toe. Put this gown on, OK? I'm afraid there is something. I'm surprised as you are by the test results. It's ah... I ah... you know, it's unusual really. I would never have expected ah... What? Expected what? Motor neuron disease. You have some kind of a motor neuron disease. What's a...a motor neuron disease? It's a tricky... it's a funny umbrella. There are many variations, permutation... Doctor, doctor, please, please, we're trying to understand here. Is this something temporary? Is this something that's going to go away? I mean, you...you're giving us nothing. I can't say anything with certainly. But I... I can get you a referral. Scotty? Hm? How do you do a search? What are you going to search for? Motor neuron disease. ALS. What is that What is that Ah, type ALS. Hit search. Well, one last test Ms. Estess. And it's really very simple. I'd like you to sit down on the floor there. Hm. OK. Good. Now can you ah get up please? OK. Heh, heh, ha. Ah. I can't. I can't do it. Here You have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Jenifer, or motor neuron disease. But it's more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. ALS destroys the neurons that carry instructions from your brain to your muscles. Oh my God. How old was Lou Gehrig when he got this? 36. And when he died he was... 38. But I'm hoping in your case that the disease will progress much slower. You have a strong spirit, Ms. Estess. You're very young. Is there medicine? Science needs to better understand ALS before we can effectively treat it. So you're not going to write me a prescription? I only wish there was one to write. I am going to refer you to Nurse Vandemal at ah Hobson Memorial. She's a bona fide expert. She can answer all of your questions and help get you situated. Everything will be fine, you'll see. There's gotta be something out there, right? Maybe we'll get lucky. The truth is, you're going to have progressive trouble getting through the day. If there's a take-home point here, it's plan ahead. Because your disease started in your limbs, your arms and legs are going to go first. I can get you a brace once your foot drops. When my foot drops? It's amazing to think of how many of our everyday movements depend on healthy muscles. Try walking without responsive ankles. We have a loan closet here. I'll take the Prada sweater. As you have additional trouble, feel free to come to us for the loan of a foot drop brace, a wheelchair, a walker. About the wheelchair, like I said, you're gonna want to plan ahead. You should start working on the paperwork right away. You're going to want a chair that will serve your growing needs, your increased inability to sit up, speak, swallow, breathe. If you opt for a respirator, you're going to want a wheelchair that can accommodate it. I'm sorry, a respirator? ALS proves fatal when your breathing muscles stop working, your diaphragm, your chest muscles. Oh, ah... Dr. Richards didn't say anything about. Well, it's suffocation pure and simple. But let's not go there. Will we have to go there? Well, everybody's different. Some last six months, two years, five years. Mm, I don't see anything really emergent here. So I'm going to give you some pamphlets to take home. I'm going I want to see you in a couple of months. And whatever you do, do not forget your rubber band. I'd rather have some kind of pill. Put that on your wrist. When you have a negative thought, snap it. Snap out of the negative and into the positive, OK? OK. Ah, oh, ah I'm right here, Jen. I'm right here. I'm right here. Sh. I'm right here. Well, I can't fake it anymore. I'm having trouble lifting my feet and my shoes. They're not cooperating. And shoes and I used to be like this. Someone's not wearing her rubber band. Yeah, well, I was wondering if there was a safer shoe that you might be able to recommend. Must I do everything for you Ms. Estess? Ah, excuse me? Look, I don't want you to crack your head open. There are tools at our disposal. These might help. There is no shame in using them. What about the shoes? Could we just start with the shoes? People have survived AIDS, cancer, I mean, there is no reason why Jenny can't pull through this. I saw this woman doctor on PBS. And her thing is that attitude affects health. What? Michael, I am just saying that there may be something to that. Yeah, look, Jules, what she needs to do is she needs to lose the cane, OK? Because it's like wearing glasses. The more you wear them, the weaker your eyes get. Hello, I'm right here. Jenny you are so tough, OK? You can beat this. I know you can. We can beat this. Uh-huh. It's your body. You take control of it. Uh-huh. I mean, it... it's like a river, OK? You put a boulder in it. You change its course. Your illness is that river. And we need... we need to change the course. A river? What are you... I don't have a cold. What part of I'm dying don't you understand? There's no medicine, no treatment, no nothing. Oh, you guys. I feel like there's a rope that's pulling my muscles down to the center of the Earth. And there's... whoo. Sorry, I'm tired. I'm just going to go up. Jenny. Honey, I'm going to bed. This is unbelievable. The experts know nothing. No one's doing anything. There are tens of thousands of people dying, Scotty. And the fact is, there's not a single effective treatment, not one. I mean, you'd think in this day and age some answers would exist, at least, that there would be some plan of attack. Doesn't this bother you, Scotty? Is there anything that bothers you at all ever? That's not fair and you know it. Val. I gotta get back to work. G'night. Yo, Pete. Back it up. Jen? Jenny? How are you? Hi. It's great to see you. - Oh. - Whoa. You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Hey, hey, I'm shooting in the city this weekend until Monday. I was going to call you. Come on in. I want you to meet the guys I'm working with. Oh, I... I gotta ... Well, what are you doing this weekend? I'm going to be out of town. Well, well come on in. Just sit for a while. You'll love these guys, I'm telling you. Oh, great, but I can't because I got a thing. You gotta go. I'll call you. OK. Oh, it was great seeing you. You too. Take care, huh? Maybe ah... if I'm in town again, we could do something? Bye. Bye. Hello? Are you on the other? No, I'm just doing some reading. There's one name that keeps coming up, Dr. Richard Feldman. He's actually looking at some potential treatment for ALS. Valerie, I don't think I can live alone anymore. The city isn't my friend, my city. Your motor neurons are dying off. Unfortunately, they'll never be replaced. Um, if they transplant hearts and lungs, why not motor neurons? Cell transplant is pure science fiction. This is the maverick? Let's give him a chance. Look, you've got a whole lab here. You've got to have something. Well, yeah, there's...there's a lot going on. It's just that there's nothing that translates into therapy right now. ALS is a complicated problem. I've read about growth factors on the internet. Right, yeah, the internet. Stay off the internet. Growth factors are good in theory. We've tested them extensively. But there's nothing so far. All right, he's saying he has nothing. Wait. So- so what do you suggest we do? A lot of my patients start eating all the junk food they want and maxing out their credit cards. I don't know. Is there any place in the world that you haven't been that you'd like to see? Dr. Richards said there was one approved drug. Yes, it extends life for maybe three months in mice. Do you have a good nurse? Oh. Gimme a minute. Don't take their poison pill. Um, I was wondering, I've really to ask you um love and men and ah... how this is going to affect that part of my life. Right. You know, if anything, emotions tend to intensify with ALS. Us The problem is your ability to express them will change too. Now I know he meant I eventually wouldn't be able to touch someone, to move, to hold. Now I know what he meant. But I didn't know then. Jen-Jen. Jen-Jen. Jake, get back here. Jen-Jen. Hi Jakey. What's going on? Mom, what are you doing here? Um, I need a lift to the station, OK? Well, I came to see Jenifer. She doesn't want to see me. So are you just going to sit there until she does? That's the plan. Look, I really gotta go. OK. Well can you just drop Amy at the station while you wait? However I can help. Well, I was going to get you the indoor Nerf basketball thing. Where? But since you want the Barbie... Ah, ha. Get off the bed. Give her a break. Oh, please leave them. They're like pumping oxygen in here. It's her I don't want to see. I don't want to see her either. But she's staying for dinner. She's so nervous. She just makes everything worse. No one's playing with me. Didn't Amy play with you? Who's Amy? It may be time to get a new baby sitter? No. How about someone wine, Jenifer? - Mother please. - Would you leave her alone. She doesn't want to come out. I want soda, grandma. No soda. Call me crazy. But she seemed stronger to me the other day. Jen-Jen said we could. Well, Jen-Jen says a lot of things. Oh, let them have soda. It's my fault. I promised them. Jen-Jen bought me toys today. Enough with the toys already. Soda, soda, soda, soda. I got it. Soda, soda. Me too, daddy. Soda for Janie girl. I'm telling you that sugar is the biggest killer of them all. I'm sick. Yeah, sure. This is really great. Terrific sauce, Meredith. Hopes. Mom, Jane's spilling. Janie. Ah. Jenifer. Ah, ah. What's wrong? What happened? - You're OK. Somebody go get... get some ice. I got the ice. Ah, Scott get a pillow for her head. You'll be fine. You'll be OK. Sh. You're OK. You're OK. OK, this is getting a little creepy. Come on Willis. Give it to'em slugger. Well, the quickie is probably our most popular model. In terms of independence, it's definitely got my vote. This is the Breezy. It's lightweight. It's collapsible. So am I . Do you have anything sportier: Well, for my nickel, nothing beats the Star. Well, you've always wanted to sit on a star. You know that add where the granny's are all in their electric wheelchairs and they're scaling the Grand Canyon? The Mountaineer. That's right. I don't want that one. All right. Com on, Willis. Come on. Honey, why don't you give him a hand? - Me? - Yeah. Help him get started. OK. All right, hold on. Mama's gonna do this a little bit, OK? Just to get your guys going. All right, go stand with daddy. OK. Whoa. What's with all the cutesy names? Why don't they call this the nightmare. Once you get it, you'll never get out. Would you like to see how it fits? I got it. Ah, ah, ha. Thank you. I'm going to get so much candy. Ow. All right. Oh, I can't. You can do it. You can do it. - No, I can't. - Yes, you can. Yes, you can. Look, you heard what the physical therapist said. The only ALS patient she's ever worked has actually gotten stronger. You do get better with what I have. This is lunacy. - You're not even trying. You guys, come on. Keep it down. I'm sorry. I'm a little confused. I'm dying but I'm not exercising properly. This is not about leg lifts or rubber bands or me giving up. . What is happening to me is out of my control. I can't take this anymore. Hey, ah we gotta tighten it up a little. Yeah, I know Peter. The kids are sleeping. Thank you. Well, it didn't sound like it. I'm becoming a burden to everyone. - Jenifer please. - How could you say that? Please, just shut up. That's such a slap in the face. Well, then why do I feel like I'm letting you down. You're not letting me down. Well, that's how I feel. Stop that. Stop yelling both of you. You know, I was thinking about you the other day. I was out with my little nephew. And I had to bend down to hear what he was saying. And I thought, this must be what it's like for you. Well, it's a little more than that. It's a very gun to your head kind of thing. If you're feeling suicidal, I have to warn you, that's not really an option for ALS patients. Suicide? Well, my late-stage patients can't really take pills. Because their hands don't work. You can't exactly jump out of a window. The only other thing you might be able to do is smother yourself. But even that would be a challenge. I can't. I can't do this anymore. God, I hate that nurse. She's an animal. I just have had enough. What do mean? I'm saying that maybe it would just be easier on everybody. You... you want to die? Is that...is that what you're saying? It's over. OK. You want to die? Great. Let's go for it. Meredith, come on, slow down. Come on, Meredith, what, are you crazy? Slow down. Look out for the car. Meredith. It costs ... I'm liking the new apartment, kiddie. It's downtown closer to me finally. I always wanted us to be roomies. Yeah, you keep that music down young lady. I just had to give Meredith her space. The phone hasn't stopped, Jenifer. Everyone wants to see you. Speaking of which, I ran into some guy named Jack. He got written out of his series. And he's back in the city. And he was asking about Kitty. You should call him. No, I'm not ready to see people. And I don't want people to feel sorry for me. Jenifer, just let me do it. Let me tell people what's going on. Nah, forget that Jules. Come on, you're back in New York City. Let's go out an celebrate. Um, let's order some pizza. No, I mean out, out. Oh, no, not tonight. You guys go. Jenifer, I can push a wheelchair. Try getting me in it. Come on Jenny. We'll go out. Just like we used to. - Yeah. - Oh, no. - Come on. I don't wanna go. - Yes. - No. Come on. It's just like dancing. I got you. Oh, God. This is mortifying. OK, I your hand. You guys. I can do this myself. That's true. Oh, Michael. Oh, Michael. So what would you like on your pizza? Hello? Jack. Jen? How are you? Jen? What's the matter? I need to talk to you. It's not so good. What? Jen, what is it? Tell me. I'm sick. I have ALS. I'm coming by tomorrow. Do we have stuff to drink? Lots. Chips and salsa? I made guacamole. Oh, genius. Julianne. Mm? We need flowers. OK, you want me to go? No, I'll run on down there. And I'll be back like in two or three years. No, wait, Jules, wait, wait, wait. No, it's excessive. All right, look, you'll open the door. Mm-hm. And then I'll be here. He'll see me in the chair. No, wait, OK. Put me on the couch and get me in a really fetching position. And I'll do a whole Deborah Kerr thing. What? Get the buzzer. Buzzer. Hello? Jack's here. Yeah, OK, send him up. Ah. OK. OK. OK. All right. Great. OK. - OK, thanks. - OK. All right, afghan. Afghan. OK. OK. Oh God, get the door. - OK, coming. - How's my hair? All right, hold on. Let me see. Good. Go... Good. OK. Oh God. Hi. Hi Jules. Come on in. Can you come sit here? Let's go out. I thought we would just stay in and rent some movies. OK, tomorrow night. Tonight we're going out. Probably not. Jenny, it is a beautiful night in this lovely city. And you should not miss it. Come on. Ah. Good? OK. We gotta to take it slow. We'll go slow. Mm, it's lovely to be out here. Isn't it? Hey, there's a Fellini film up in Lincoln Center. What do you say? What, you're going to push me five miles? We don't have to. There's a bus. Oh. Woo. Hey, ho, ho. Hey. She wanted me to bring her back... Oh, listen guys. We're pretty full up here. There's another one about five minutes behind. Come on, come on, let's go. I'm going to be late, OK? What are you talking about? You... there's empty seats back there. You got plenty of room. Hey, buddy. You heard the guy. You're holding things up. Look, I'm running schedule already. I think you'll do a lot better waiting for the next on. Jack, let's just wait. No no, no, no. We're not going to wait. You are going to lower that thing. You are going to lower that thing. Or else I'm going to call every news station in this town Or else I'm going to call every news station in this town and tell'em that bus driver number 87439 is refusing to pick up beautiful girls in wheelchairs. Your choice. My ordinary days are spent inside the maze. Of never changing ways such ordinary days. My ordinary spin showed itself again. It never seemed to end. Then you came waltzing in. Waltzing in, I'm falling, I'm falling in. I never knew the likes of you, extraordinary thing. I do believe that you are indeed an extraordinary thing. My ordinary game predictable and plain. has never been the same since you came waltzing in, waltzing in, I'm falling, I'm falling in. I never knew the likes of you, extraordinary thing. I do believe that you are indeed an extraordinary thing. I never knew the likes of you... Maybe we could do better than those other groups. Why would anybody take us seriously? We'd have to run it like a business, raise a lot of cash. Right, right right. We gotta shake it up. We gotta pull it out of the shadows. We gotta make people see what it is. Yeah. You gotta make doctors accountable. Well, make them care about this illness. Give them serious funding with conditions. Right on. Enough of these academic exercises. You work together. You work for answers. Or you're fired. Yeah, yeah, take these guys down from their pedestal. Hold a gun to their head. Do everything faster. Run it like a movie studio. Yeah, remember The Manhattan Project? Okie dokie. They brought together the best scientists in the world to design the atom bomb. That will be our model. We'll call it um ALS Project. Ah, I... - Ah, ah, Project ALS. - Yeah, I like it. Jen? Yeah, that works for me. Project ALS. Project ALS. Hm, see, sometimes, you know. We figured if we could produce a play for naked angels, we could produce a cure for ALS. And the...the turning point was Donna Hanover, who's the first lady of New York. And she invited Project ALS to hold its first press conference at Gracie Mansion. Did I ever have any doubts about moving in with Jenifer? No, why would I? God, I hate this. This is insane. You know how I feel about public speaking. Get over it. Remember to talk about the entertainment industry uniting with corporate America. I can't do this. It's you turn now, Jenifer. You have to. Just take a deep breath, sit up straight. That's what I do when I'm scared. Mother, she needs help. I am helping. Lipstick. Oh. Let's how we can do this. I'd take 10 years in the wheelchair right now, 10 years in the wheelchair. Mom, don't. I need you to be a mother right now. Oh. Oh, that's much better. You see, Meredith? You're much better at it than I am. I guess I'm really going out there. You look beautiful. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce a friend of mine. She is a woman of courage. She is brilliant, beautiful, and tenacious. And she is leading the fight against a disease that should concern us all. Please welcome Jenifer Estess. Thank you, Donna Hanover. Hello. My name is Jenifer Estess. When I was first diagnosed... when I was first diagnosed, I was just another city girl living the city girl life. And now I'm just another city girl who's been told she has three to five years to live. I needed a lot of help getting here today. I needed help getting dressed. I couldn't put on my own lipstick. I can't walk pretty much at all. I have ALS. It's a disease that comes out of nowhere AND is always fatal. And there's no medicine and that's just unacceptable. I've come to realize that I shouldn't be going through this, nor should anyone else, not in this day and age. So we've started an organization, Project ALS. Because when we find a cure, and that is our goal, not ways to make life more manageable but a cure. When we do that, we will beat this disease and other related problems like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. But we need your help. And I know that if we work together like a family that we can change the face of modern medicine. Thank you. Yeah. What we're wondering is since the FDA already has so many approved drugs out there why we can't screen some of them to see if they apply to ALS. Well, that's a crude approach. There's got to be something. You know, there are only 30,000 people in this country at any given time with ALS. The government regards it as an orphan disease. There's no critical mass of patients. But aren't the numbers at any given time so low because people with the disease die so fast? Ugh, I just want to go home. I'm tire. Come on, we've got one more meeting set up. We might as well go. Meredith, forget it. Come on, this is the guy that you found online. We should just go and ask him if stem cells might work in ALS. He'll probably just laugh us out of the room. Hi. Hello. I'm Dr. Sanders. Donut? Ah, no. You sure? They're very good. Thank you. OK. I thought I'd ah... put a little slide show on for you guys. Um, for 14 years I've been ah transplanting stem cells into mice that basically mimic children's brain diseases. They seem to travel to areas of injury in the brain, set up shop, and in some instances they actually transform themselves into healthy new cells. In layman's terms, they're like seeds. Flower seeds know to become flowers. Grass seeds know to become grass. Stem cells are like really smart seeds. They go into the body and become whatever it is they need to become. You've heard of multiple sclerosis haven't you? Mm-hm. Well, now, here we see stem cells transforming into cells that were once destroyed in MS. It's amazing, isn't it? Could stem cells replace damaged motor neurons in ALS? You're the first person to ask me that question. Yeah, I think maybe you could. Jenifer? Hey, Jenifer. This is going to be the Project ALS theme song. I hitched a ride with a vending machine repair man. Hey, I think we're really get out of this. What happened with the Princeton guy? No, no, forget him. We're going with Sanders. Yeah, we're going to put him together with Feldman. Feldman and Sanders together. Stem cells. Yes, I think stem cells are the answer. Lay back, enjoy the show. Everybody gets high. Everybody gets low. These are the days when anything goes. Every day is a winding road. I get a little bit closer. Every day is a faded sign. I get a little bit closer to feelin' fine. Ah. I believe you said Jenifer's motor neurons are dying and they'll never be replaced. So what do you think, Rick? I think I owe the sisters Estess an apology. Yeah. All right, hold on. We still have a long way to go here. Yeah, but at least we're going somewhere. Good job, Aaron. Anything goes. Every day is a winding road. I get a little bit closer. Every day is a winding... Where is Jack? He's getting the theater tickets. What are you doing? I... I'm sorry. I don't do it as well as he does. Jen, you want Peter and me to transfer you? No, I'll just wait for Jack. Would you like to order? We're waiting for someone else. We could order some appetizers. Nothing for me. Jen, I could help you. No, not here. Who wants a drink? We should toast the People Magazine article. And the Today Show spot. Yeah, the Forbe space. Got'em. Fourth row, right on the aisle. - Mm. I had to schmooze the house manager. Mm-hm. But I got'em. Oh, oh, oh. You look great. You hungry? Starving. This is a good place. Mm. I'm taking you on a trip. My folks have a place upstate. They're never there. I can't. Come on. It'll be great. A weekend in the country. Don't you think it'll be a little bit more like Weekend At Bernie's? I'm scared. Trust me, Jenny. I got you. Ready to go. Take me along. I want to ride shotgun. I want to laugh at your jokes. I want to know you better than anyone. But anyone can see why you, you'd run. I packed a small bag. Can't you see a truck full of things you cherish. What about me? Take me along. I wanna ride shotgun. I want to laugh at your jokes. I want to know you better than anyone, but anyone can see why you'd run. When I tried to find a substitute a box full of hearts and letters. But he wasn't you. I wish Valerie could have you at both doctors. Put my arms around you. I love you. I'm so in love with you, Jack. I love you, too, Jen. But you... I understand, really I do. But I want us to spend this time together. I want us... Jen um... I'm... I wouldn't want to do anything that... you're incredible, Jen. If I ever hurt you, I'd want to die. I want to spend the rest of my life with you however long that is, whatever that means. Jen. I'm sorry, Jen. Sh. Sh, sh, sh, sh. When he went back to L.A., it was just brutal. You know when I got sick, I couldn't listen to music anymore. I just couldn't do it. But with Jack I could listen again. He led me back to a place in my life. I never thought I'd have that again. Oh, so pretty. Oh that party rocked. Oh. Girl's got to know when to cut her losses. Don't you find this job a little depressing, Lorna? Not really, know. I like helping people. I guess you've seen a lot of people die. Some. Some get better. What's it like when people die? Jennifer, why you always want to talk about such things? OK, have you ever seen anyone as sick as me get better. And you have to tell me honestly. I took care of. A boy once. He had AIDS. He was dying. I mean, he was just skin and bones. And then they came out with that AIDS cocktail. And he took it. And you should see him now. He's fine and walking around. I just don't want to put my sisters the position where they have to decide for me. I think you're going to be around for a long time to come. OK. Let's put the BiPAP on. And I will let you breathe through me. I will let you be with me. Yeah. Lorna. - Ma'am are you all right? - Hm? - Can you hear me, ma'am? - Y...yes. - Do you see my fingers? - Yes. OK. What's her name please? - Jenifer. - Jenifer. OK, Jenifer, what I'm going to do is I'm going to remove the sheets from you now. OK, so I'm going to remove this mask. Do... Don't worry. All right? Here we go. Ready? One, two, three lift. I will let you breathe through me. I will let you be with me. Whenever I'm alone and you're lost out there, I can feel you breathe cause our lungs we share. I guess it's time for the Hamlet question, Dr. Richards. To be or not to be? To trach or not to trach. Do I bow out gracefully or do I go on a Respirator Jennifer, if your breathing and swallowing get any worse, you're going to have to make that choice. A tracheotomy is a fairly straightforward procedure. But you may lose your ability to speak. You will be completely dependent on a respirator. I can't imagine that life. Hello Dr. Richards. Hello. Why don't you start thinking about that trach? With the other option being? The other option being that you can help make you comfortable. Call me if you have any questions. Thank you. Too sleep pretends to dream and never wake up is what he means. Look, I think what my sister is saying is that project ALS has been funding all of your research. You guys, please, we need a new game plan. Aaron where are we? What do you need? Well, there's a fellow in Georgetown who specializes in spinal cord injury. Really smart guy. I think it would be really helpful to have him in our lab. So wh... what's the problem? Well, he... he lives and works in Washington D.C. So we'll bring him here. He has a family. We'll move his family. People are getting sicker. Understood. But there are procedures and protocols that we have to follow. Where do we stand with the animal model? Well, we've just injected stem cells into our first litter of ALS mice. And? And, now we wait and see. OK, but if we see real improvement in this litter, then we're ready to start the human trials, right? Ho...ho... hold on, OK? Now, let's just understand something. These experiments take months to complete. Months. She's having trouble breathing. She's on the BiPAP most of the day. Where are the stem cells for Jenifer? Meredith, if you're asking us to save your sister, there's no guarantees here. You guys have to look at the bigger picture. But Rick, you can cut some air out of your schedule, can't you? I don't even want to talk about schedules or... or experimental models. Where is the shot for Jenifer? This far gorilla science, OK? It's a new way of working for us. And we're grateful to you. But you're not giving us a chance to do our jobs. OK, what my sister is sa... What I'm saying is that we're running out of time. And I don't want my sister to die. I don't know. Tonight, the most important voice you'll hear belongs to the people living with ALS in a time of no medicine. Here to read the words of one of them is the star of stage and screen, Ms. Nina Capelli. Woo hoo. Please tell me this is not happening. I'm so young. I was just hitting my stride when I learned I had ALS. I look at my sisters, I want to tell them, this will go away. I want to take their children in my arms and tell them I will be at their high school graduations and that I will teach them to dance to Frank Sinatra. Please tell me this is not happening. Today I'm in a wheelchair. I used to express myself with my hands. Now they seem to belong to someone else. I long for my life and my body the way that it was. But the love of my family and friends keeps me going. And it's that kind of compassion that will unlock the mystery of ALS. People with ALS get sick so fast that they have a hard time fighting for themselves. Maybe that's why so little has been done. But I believe that together we can change the landscape of this disease. Jenifer Estess, New York City. We have got to get her that shot. I mean, we've raised over $7 million dollars so far. But we have got to get more. We've gotten the best doctors, the biggest stars, the press, the ads. But where is the shot? Where is it? We need it now. I just want her saved. I read about your benefit. You raised a lot of money. It was a huge success. I understand most of it is going to stem cells and other research? That's where it's going. You're neglecting patient support. Clinics like this one, Ms. Estess, which cater to the growing needs of patients. You know better than anyone that is the best medicine for people living now. Are you asking me for money? For patient support. Research is years away. You call this what you're dishing out here patient support? Suicide tips and a closet full of walkers? Patient support is compassion and kindness and heart. And all the millions can't buy you that. By the way Nurse Vandemal, you're fired. Get my sister. Lorna, I need another bite of bagel please, sorry. Oh, go and get ALS, the big kahuna. It's so annoying. So dramatic. Eh, now all we have to do is re-invent the wheel. Mm, sorry. Yeah? Janey, can I have a kiss? I already did. Mm. I need another one. Meredith make her kiss me. Go kiss Jen-Jen. Like she's going to listen to me. This is amazing. Yes, I know. I know. I realize that. Don't play it so cool. This is fantastic. Oh...OK right. Um, I'll check in with you later. The mice, our mice, the stem cells are working. Over 50% of them have restoration and movement. They are walking around Jenifer. That's great. Where's Jen's shot? Yeah, how long Valerie? Nine months to a year before human trials can begin. Can you just hold out? Nine months, I don't know. Can I hang on for nine months? You'll have to. Mm. I feel that what's important in life is where your heart is fundamentally. I love Jenifer in the best way I can and in the way that she has allowed me to love her. I believe Jenifer knows how I feel about her, what she means to me. And I know in my heart that my love and my commitment to her are unending and boundless. And that will never change. Can I take this off now? Listen, I'll come down there and paint the house myself. Ha, ha. That's what I told them. If you want a half a million dollars for a house, you've got to spruce it up a little. Oh. Some people just don't get it. Mom, the BiPAP. I'll get Lorna. No, she's at the grocery store. No, it can't wait. Just push it in. I don't know Jenifer. Push the hose in. I won't do it right. I need you. Oh. Mom. Mom. Mm. Now. What? I can't put my arms around anyone. Well, I could hold you. if you want me to. I can't hold you back. Well, if you don't want me to. No mom. I want you to. Hey. Hey. What you doing? I'm working on a speech for the spring benefit. Can I hear use some of it? It's pretty lousy. Mm, I doubt that. Promise me you'll keep writing. I promise. Thank you, Lorna. You know the scariest part of death for me is the thought of never seeing you guys again or being alone without you. We will always be together, no matter what happens. Easy for you to say now. I've always believed that. What are you talking about? Oh, life and death. You want to get dinner? Yeah, why don't you guys order. You'll go on the trach when you have to. You'll get better. You'll come off the trach and reverse it. I don't know if I want to live with a trach. And even if I go on it, I'm only going to get worse. And there may just be a point where I just want to let go. You know that we will never let you suffer. If you think that you can't go on... But what if you don't go on the trach and in six months they find the medicine? Look, whatever happens, you guys gotta promise me that you're going to go on with your lives. You are our life, Jenifer. OK, one more thing. You both look like crap. Nice Jenifer. No, I'm not kidding. You looking exhausted. What time is it? 7:30? Meredith, do you know where your children are? No, you don't, do you? Willis is at karate. You guys should be home with your kids and your husbands. I don't know if they'll have me. I think we got it covered, Jenifer. Well I need you to know that it's going to be OK, no matter what happens, no matter if it's in time for me. And that is so all right. Because no one should have to go through go ever again. I may be crazy. But I think we're gonna get out of this. Mm-mm. Yeah, let's go into inner sanctum here. Peter. Peter's eating. Meredith? Hi. Hi. Hello, hello. Oh, look who it is. - Kitty. - Lorna and my Kitty. Lorna, take me to see my sweet baby James. Come here. You can do it. Oh, you can do it, James. Yes, baby, yes, James. Oh. I can't believe it. This just might work. Project ALS is really moving things along remarkably fast. Um, can I show you something? You want to see what stem cells look like? They look like fireworks. Make of our lives, one life. Day after day, one life. - Finally, I - think that's what we were. We were like those cells. Each of us became what we needed to become. We did what we had to do. Even death won't part us... us now.
