All right. We already started filming. You can begin to surprise us. You will tell me the operations you are going to do. Now I'm applying the foundation. You have to spread it well. No, the technical details do not interest me. Ah, ok. I just have to mark the operation changes. Ok. -Is she speaking loud enough, José? -No. My name is Ana, and I am an actress. My name is Ana, and I am an actress. So started the script written four years ago. And that should be, or almost, the first image. I wanted that to be the first image of October in Madrid. Do you think it will take longer than you told me? -I have no idea. -You do not know? Remember, you need to make your eyebrows a little harder. Yes. It is necessary that you speak louder. Now, the eyes. How many meters? 127 feet Hello? Yes. No, Marcel is filming. Can you call back later? In fifteen minutes. This girl is an actress; she lives in Madrid. -Don't lean forward. -We are not in October. I associated the words "Madrid" and "October" for their sonority. This film is a film both of freedom and obligation. A film of truth and fiction. A film to exist, to become true, it goes through all the difficulties, beyond the real difficulties caused by the contradictions found by the filmmaker at every moment. At this very moment, for example, in which I try to say this text, to read this text, because I am writing this text and I'll reread it later with a microphone in a recording room. -Now, I put on my lipstick. -I am saying it. I was told: "You should not comment on your own images yourself. Your voice is too serious, too slow, too sad. "It would be a mistake." I catch that word on the fly, I make it mine, I'm going to break it, caress, twist, bend, let fly, restart and break. I want it that way, like I wanted this film. I'm ready. Fine, thanks. Finished. October in Madrid I've been coming to Spain regularly for several years. I'm here this time for a few months. I liked Spain well before knowing it. Exile is dear to me. Exile is a wall for surrounding yourself. My first image of Spain was that of a bull trapped in his solitude. I followed him with a telephoto lens until his death. The film is called La muerte Del toro. My second image of Spain was that of Christ. I filmed during Holy Week in Valladolid high place of old Castile. Le Christ dans la cité I now have 3,000 meters of film to impress with a borrowed camera, but with the constraint of not knowing the results until my return to Paris. For a long time I want to narrate the bullfighter's private life. Guillermo introduced me to two young novilleros. We start filming their training. We spent one morning at the Casa de Campo. It is of little relevance to know what made this morning unique and that this record is unfinished. I just accepted to make news reports for television. Here is Roncal, valley of the Pyrenees. It was to be about the tribute that the French shepherds made to the Spaniards. I did not film the ceremony itself. I had no desire to after walking thirty kilometers in the rain. El Verdugo The Executioner They asked me to make a documentary about the filming of this film by Luis Berlanga. I accompanied Berlanga and his team to different locations in Madrid for a week. There, the idea of October in Madrid brutally shines. One day Berlanga was to film in the Plaza de las Comendadoras. The sight moves me because of its rigidity and greatness, for the oddness of its details. An electric antenna planted in the center. A pendulum that always marks eight o'clock. I decide that this square will be part of the script that I have left to solve. I later made a documentary about Sofia Loren filming in The Fall of the Roman Empire. I thought of the scenario for October in Madrid. An extra, a slave of Sofia Loren, who lives in the Plaza de las Comendadoras, every morning she travels from that square to the Roman Forum built 15 kilometers from Madrid. Opposition of two anachronistic worlds. Dream, daily dazzlement of this extra Carmen who goes from one mediocrity to another more artificial and more deceptive. Fall of her dream, at the end of the filming. Fall of my dream. It was obviously impossible to realize that idea, even thinking about it under the logic of the documentary. Anyway, I have the main character of the film. It crystallizes, as in my previous film, in a woman. The women of Une simple histoire and Le Huitième jour. Ana, the actress, for a film that never saw the day. The garden of the Retiro, in Madrid. It's Sunday. What will Carmen do? What will Carmen be? Who will Carmen do? What character are we going to shoot? I have been told from Paris that my tax collector threatens to seize me. Seize me with what? Carmen will not try to escape her mediocrity by exceptional means. She will be a seller in a big store which she'll walk to every morning from Plaza de las Comendadoras. She will have a boyfriend, she will dream of children, and a good house. The big store where Carmen will work will be, for example, Galerías Preciados. Nadia introduced me to her father. He is a painter and engraver. He proposed I use his studio as a decoration for the film. Maybe it's Carmen's boyfriend studio, who will be a painter and will be called Guillermo. My name is Carmen. My name is Carmen. Marcel, your film will not be easy. I think you have a very interesting idea. The problem will be not to tire the public with a story told with too many words and few images. Obviously, it can be done in several ways. I think that cinema is, above all, a form of expression through images. The word can add or counterpoint the image, but you can not count on the word to develop that story. I'm sure that you'll be able to overcome this problem and that you're going to make a really interesting film. Continue to tighten them. What do you think of the film? Remember that conversation we had in your house in front of the television? I think that the film shouldn't be linear. You have to make films like life itself, or even the brain of man. It doesn't go in one direction. There is simultaneity. Many directors tried to do things in that sense, but few have achieved it yet. Maybe even without knowing it, artists sometimes achieve... Nadia likes the idea of the film. She proposes to help me, and she does it with extraordinary brilliance. ... sometimes in a conscious way, and I hope you do... Pregnant, and until the day before delivery, she is by my side. I happen to be discouraged, and she gives me energy. I filmed it in the studio of her house. She will be part of the film. Some months after finishing the shots, I'll return to Madrid to record the ideas she proposed during the shoot. She finds them in the smallest details. ... it can be done with images or through words. With Nadia I film a Sunday the preparations for a religious procession in Plaza de las Comendadoras with the intention of filming Carmen and Guillermo one day to convert them, through editing, into testimonies of this procession. Carlos' sister will be Carmen's character. Carlos is one of my friends in Madrid. He gives me an effective and discreet help since the first time I was in Spain. I still haven't found the character of Guillermo, Carmen's boyfriend. Carmen is a tall, beautiful brunette. I'll shoot her later. I live in Madrid, Plaza de las Comendadoras. With Nadia, I film the documentary aspect of the Plaza de las Comendadoras I want to describe the place where Carmen is going to live. I find it hard to believe that this place is not the one of a town and that it's very close to the store where I work. Children and the elderly are almost intermediate generations. They tell me, "We are not beautiful, why are you filming us?" I answer that they are beautiful. That is what I think. I need money to survive until the film ends, to put gas in my car and move freely. We have to shoot a boat ride with Carmen and Guillermo in the lake of the Retiro Garden, from Carmen's point of view, without ever seeing her. There will be sun in the trees, and a finger of Carmen in the water. I want Carmen to come across, at some point, a communion of nuns. Later I will film that communion in Montreuil sur Bois, near Paris. Guillermo will take Carmen home for the first time, and they will make love for the first time. They will have to go dancing. Time pass. I go through Madrid. I'm looking for places, ideas. I film everything I want, everything that is presented and that I like. A procession between virgin and bayonets. El Rastro, a sort of flea market. Wouldn't it be very picturesque to take Carmen there? How will Carmen be dressed? La Castellana is a very wide avenue and very busy around eleven o'clock in the morning. A market of old Madrid. My car's tailpipe is broken. Death. A peasant on his donkey lost in the Paseo Del Prado. He asks me where is Glorieta de Cuatro Caminos. I guide him, and I give him a tip for having filmed it. He refuses with dignity. A light of my car does not work. Is the film going to be made? Is it going to end? Will I make it to the end? Néstor Basterretxea. He is a friend of Nadia. He proposes to me to photograph an industrial short that he is making. I agree I'm bailed out. My film is going to be made. I write a summary on a page and a half. Now I want the most free and different film. My janitor. She comes from Asturias, a mining country. Luis, I met you while you shot the film El Verdugo. I followed you for a week. I made a documentary about that film for television. It's from the film El Verdugo by Berlanga that the idea came for October in Madrid. On Sunday I'll film Luis Berlanga at home. I will seek a new breath in that encounter. Maybe an answer to my own problems. I will record Berlanga's observations as well as Nadia's, a few months later. What has prevented me from seeing it is that there had been many cuts. Which are the sequences that have been deleted. -I prefer to speak in Spanish. -Yes I express myself better in my language. The cuts they made in my film can not be free. That would mean that censorship would not respond to anything. It would be so anarchist and surreal like us as creators. There was an obviously absurd intention in making those cuts because everything I wanted to say about society and about the problem of the relationship between the individual and society it is still evident in the version that was exhibited in Spain, although on the other hand they have altered the dramatic progression of the film. The intention of the censorship has not been in any way to eliminate the hardest parts or stronger showing the executions of those condemned to death in Spain, but to suppress the dramatic accentuation of this conflict of man and society. I get happy every time I make movies. I film in an increasingly vegetative, spontaneous and sleepwalking way. I get to wonder if we really do the cinema we want, that we like, and if we feel it when we are doing it. I practically corral my films. They are there, they exist. I love them or I let them love themselves. Until how it is possible to love or hate a creature at certain times. I do not have any project. I like to do things, both in the cinema and in love, in the most vegetative way possible. It is absurd to talk about projects for a man like me, who likes to find unforeseen things along the way. I have projects, but precisely because I have them, I do not like them anymore. I do not have the least affection for them anymore. What do you think of the young Spanish cinema? I start from the base of believing in individuals as good anarchists, and in the author's policy. I do not believe in schools nor in a general definition of what we could call it "young Spanish school". Individually, there are authors that I like and interest, and others that interest me less. We must look for our roots. Maybe I'm a bit old, but the Spanish must, in principle, face that immensity that is ahead, and external problems. We are not going to start being introspective like the French or Italians. We are not yet capable of introspection in the cinema. It is with this prescription that Spanish, by tradition, not in a pejorative sense but because of the authentic Spanish tradition, it floods all things, including the cinema. I think that every young Spanish filmmaker can film what is proposed, but his records usually give the impersonation of something external, Foreign, about him. This is how you think about something, but that something is not the truth. It does not matter if you are on the street, in our country, in our geography. What you must feel is a violent impression of chaos before the things instead of simply reflecting them. Yesterday, Sunday. Guillermo took me to the Retiro Garden. We rode in a boat. He was the one who rowed. I know Maribel from Carlos, Carmen's brother. Maribel married a soldier she hasn't seen in four years. She must leave for Rio de Oro, where her husband's garrison is. My name is Carmen. I live in a pension of a fat and kind woman, whose husband works in Paris. She is from Toledo, like my family. The woman who is to become the one who hosts Carmen in Plaza de las Comendadoras. Carmen's family lives in the province and Carmen in this woman's boarding house. This woman's husband works in Paris, on the street De la Pompe. He sends her cash monthly in exchange for some other adventure with Parisians skinnier than her. I was born in Toledo. I left my mother in Toledo. I did not know my father. He died in the civil war a few days before my birth. Toledo Old city of Jews and Arabs. City of calm and balance, city of distancing. Architecture immobile in time. In a slow train like those who exist in Spain, It seems I go back in time to go to Toledo. Agustín is not the ideal character for Carmen's boyfriend. He will not be a painter. The studio where he'll take Carmen will be a studio lent by a friend painter At the same time I filmed Carmen and Guillermo's walk along the lake of the Retiro Garden, I capture the ordinary aspect of the place. A young girl who looks like a eighteenth century English painting. I ask her if she can wait for me to film her. the time it takes to go and look for a roll of film in the car. She is late and she tells me she will be scolded. It was the first time I had gone to Guillermo's house. There were bright and moving pictures there. We can see Madrid and many terraces with hanging clothes. There are also iron sculptures. We went for a walk after the lake of the Retiro Garden. Carmen abandons me, she does not want to be filmed anymore. However, we did the make-up scenes, and we chose her wardrobe. Will I be able to make her come back? This is the party of the Plaza de las Comendadoras. Every year there is a procession in honor of the Virgin. We saw it with Guillermo. Afterwards, we decided to go the dance. Guillermo is a painter. Artist and painter. It was my friend Guillermo Delgado who suggested the name of Carmen's boyfriend and the idea of making him a painter. With little natural light and a single lamp I did Guillermo's scene as a way to sustain the cinematic aspect for which we have great resources. Otherwise, everything is impossible. These are the draft of a correspondence with a girl opposite of him, a French girl, and for a few mornings she has undressed in front of him, knowing he watches. Guillermo, while we were shooting your sequence, You asked me something that shocked me and also gave me pleasure. -You asked me- -What do you like what you do? It's formidable, you found the same infirmation. And that's the question I wanted Do you think it's normal to ask me that question without knowing me enough? Do you think I can like that job? -We're speaking artist to artist, right? -Yes. Well, I think that is... the background of the ethical question of the artist: Enjoy what you do. Particularly in these times, so... -So? -So prostituted. -Prostituted? In every sense of the word. My friend Carlos. He is the brother of the girl interrogated to make Carmen. I will never film Carmen. Her boyfriend forbade it. Carlos's intervention could not reverse that decision. She is Spanish, and her name is María Carmen Miguela. Together, we filmed La muerte Del toro. I had met her on my first trip to Spain where I made my first film. It's been five years since then. Five years that passed like a storm. I lost my actress. I lost Carmen. I'm looking for Carmen. I am looking for a possible Carmen. I film at random in the street Will I find Carmen? The garden of Consuelo. The mother of Consuelo. The neighbor of Consuelo. Consuelo has black eyes like those of a gypsy. I have met her in front of the Prado Museum. With María Carmen Miguela, we went to her mother's to ask her if she allowed Consuelo to participate in the film. The mother excused Consuelo of not being able or wanting to go to the appointment we had set where I had saw her for the first time. My reflectors wait for Carmen. My camera waits for the reflections there. My friend Jorge. Poet and mining engineer. He returned from an oil exploration in Rio de Oro. He has been interested in the film, and has helped me. I wanted to fix his image. A mutual friend tells me this news by a letter from Madrid. José Antonio, poet. Correspondent in Madrid for a Parisian newspaper. He helped me in filming Le Christ dans la cité. The dance hall that I chose for Carmen and Guillermo It is almost empty. It just rained. The ballroom was almost empty. It had just rained. Guillermo wanted to take me to his house. I decided to shoot another dance that does not correspond to my characters. There are no Carmens, there are no actors. My friends are not free. I film from a balcony in the rain, the houses around, the street. An accident. Aranjuez, 60 kilometers from Madrid. One of the best bullfights of the season. Nadia tells me of this bullfight and she recommends me not to miss it. New York: "Jump" screams the crowd to the man desperately perched on the second floor. Yemen: The rebels are shot in the public square before ten thousand people. Saigon: A rebel is shot before television cameras for several million viewers. Atlanta: White policemen in a car for several kilometers they chase after a group of blacks grade-schoolers. Before losing consciousness, he pointed his murderer: his daughter. Jean-Claude, 19 years old, kills his cousin with hammer blows, a beautiful baker who rejected his advances. The crew of Russian American cosmonauts. It is in its thirty-third revolution. The two members went out one by one from the capsule. A dance in the surroundings of Madrid. The dance was never visited by Carmen and Guillermo. Jeanette, actress. Also sells stamps and butterflies near the Gran Vía. My name is Carmen. My name is Carmen. Every morning I walk to work. Two friends introduce me to Jeanette. Blonde and white, she's cute. She is not Carmen. I like her. She will be Carmen. The idea of Carmen walking to work every morning makes me want to record with my teleobjective Jeanette, free in the streets of Madrid. I try to show her from multiple angles. Free of all obligation. Free like I was and I am, and how I want to continue being. Carmen is not going to know this location, as we had anticipated in the script. She will not have met Guillermo. I will not have met Carmen. The empty location is useless. My phone has been cut for several days. I still have to film the first and last shots of the film. Before leaving Madrid, I organize a flamenco party in tribute to my friend Juan, among other friends. It's September 26, I believe. The tape recorder that I have is not synchronized with my camera. It was backing and advancing that I could mount these images. By the way, it doesn't matter. I did not use the same order to organize the image reels and the sound reels. This must be the last image according to the script written four years ago. I wanted it to be the last image of October in Madrid. Jeanette taking off her makeup, and so she repeats the gestures of Ana, the actress. Subtitles by Swain and Gundenspand
