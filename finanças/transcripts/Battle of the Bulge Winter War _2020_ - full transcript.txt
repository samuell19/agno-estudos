You okay, sir? Yeah, Joe. Just a bit further, sir. Little blue, little blue, over. Little blue, little blue, over. Little blue, little blue, can anyone hear me? Come back, please. Any luck? I don't know, sir. The battery's just not liking the cold. Deader than a can of corned beef, sir. - Can you fix it? - Well, depends. If we can get the battery to warm up, we might have a chance. Jason? Nothing, sir. I bet if we get to higher ground, we might have better luck. The whole damn German army behind us and we don't have a radio that works. All right, I'm gonna go give it a try. Orders, if we can't get out of here in 10 minutes, salvage what you can and destroy the rest. Don't leave anything for the Germans. Sir, yes sir. Mark, why don't you flip the lights on for a minute and see if that warms it up. All right. How's that? Yeah, just give it a few minutes. - Oh, shit. - Any luck? I don't know, I didn't get a clear look. Jack, I'm asking you if they saw you. I don't know, I don't know, okay? I don't know. Corporal, they gotta be coming. - We need to fight 'em off. - Shut up. Hey, what's your name? Shut the hell up, would ya? Okay? If you give away our position, then we're dead. - We can't just stay here. - I know, I know. All right, here's the deal. Listen up. I want a perimeter spread out down this tree line. Tight and quiet, nobody shoots unless I do, got it? - Yes, sir. - Okay, go. Take it easy, you understand me? Yeah, I heard him. Damn 106th transfers are a pain in the ass. Yeah, no shit. Hey, keep that bar down, we're laying low this time. - What's going on? - Germans. - What? - The Germans. - What, Nazis? - Yeah, Nazis. You're a man of few words, chief. - Hey hunt, gimme one. - Yeah, yeah, me too, me too. - It ain't time. - Just take it from our count. Yeah, come on. - They better all be in here. - They are. - What about a light? - Shut up. The hell with that. What the fuck? - Piece of shit. - Put it down. What the hell is that? Piece of shit jammed on me. Whoa, hey, hey, hey. Look at me, all right? Look at me! Follow my orders or I'm gonna fucking kill you, got it? Yes corporal, sure. - All right. - I got it. Get your shit and let's go. Hey Jack, what do you want me to do with this? Next time, try taking off the damn safety. Listen to me. Look, you're gonna get us all killed. Listen or we're all dead, you understand me? I said do you understand me? Yes tech-corporal, I understand you. - Sir. - Haas. Has general Omar Bradley arrived yet? No, sir. Not yet. But we have everything set up, just like you asked. Updates? Reports keep pouring in. Sector h is withdrawing all along our lines. The German 12th and 9th panzer divisions seem to be in full force and knocking on everyone's front door. All units reporting enemy contact. The spotting plane, is it ready? Can it go up? We are working on it but the weather still isn't ideal. All planes are grounded. Haas, I need to know what's going on out there. I need aerial observation, come on. We will double our efforts, sir. You heard from captain Daniels? Not yet, sir. He hasn't reported. - He hasn't reported in yet? - No, sir. What about lieutenant cappa? We haven't heard from him either, sir. This is the big one, isn't it, major? Well, we got our work cut out for us, captain. Yes, sir. Give me a hit of that, chief. Chief? You know I'm Italian, right, not Indian? Wait, you're not Indian? No. Americanos never know the difference between us, mi amigo. You're Mexican? No. Don't tie your boots too tight. You're gonna cut off circulation. You're not gonna be able to feel your feet. I can't feel my feet as it is already. - Jack. - Hmm? You wanna turn it like this. You know back home, whenever I went on a stroll in the woods or anything like that, I'd always take a compass with me so I could find my way out. Sure. My brother on the other hand, I mean he could find his way out of anything. The kid would just use the sun, the woods, the stars, you name it, I mean he was a Lewis. I was no Clark, let's put it that way. Right. Do you miss him? Yeah. I do. Is he in the service? Yeah, actually when this whole damn thing started, we enlisted together. I guess we thought we'd be in the same unit and you know the army, they had different plans. Yeah well, I know how that goes. I found that out the day I got the draft notice. Okay, you were drafted. - I was. - Get outta here. I was a shoe salesman in Chicago. - No. - Yeah. - Jack was a shoe salesman? - That's right. Just crabby old ladies mostly. Maybe you should have this. Jack, you're doing fine, okay? Okay. All right, we gotta move. Tell the guys. Yes, corporal. Asshole. Little blue, little blue, over. Little blue, little blue, anyone out there? Over. All right, try that. Shit, turn it off, turn it off. Hey, hey, hey, you killed my radio. You're the one using all the juice, lefty. So what do we do now? Looks like we walk. Thank Jesus. You boys having some trouble? We're glad to see you, sir. What's wrong with her? Battery's dead. Yeah well, batteries don't like the cold much but then again, who does? The radio still work? When she's got juice. So if we were to go ahead and give you a jump, she'd work just fine, huh? Yeah, I reckon it would. So you think you can give us a jump? Anybody else know you boys are out here? No. Just us. What's going on, sir? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Y'all can't even do it right. I really am sorry. All right boys, let's clean this puppy up. - English, please. - Sorry, captain. What do we do with the bodies? Leave 'em. Yes sir. All right boys, let's go. We need boots on the ground in 20 minutes. I need this thing purring like a goddamn cat. Let's go, let's go, let's go. We got chili on the stove. We got people to see. Jesus Christ almighty, Mary, Joe and Joseph. Keep up. Damn thick snow. It ain't gonna get better. My damn feet, they're as cold as ice. I told you not to tie your boots so tight. The bar was a bad choice. - How you do that? - Old Indian secret. What secret? Don't volunteer to carry the bar. I have no idea. Well, the Germans could be anywhere. Loud as hell, corporal. I can hear y'all for miles. Take it easy, fellas. Can't be too careful these days. Plenty of German patrols in the area. Why don't you come with us? We'll get you back to friendly lines. - Hot food? - Sure, if we're lucky. Why don't you boys come along with us? We got a couple of jeeps ready to take you back. All right, go on. - So what do you think? - I don't know. Something feels funny. Coming, corporal? Yeah. Just tell 'em to keep their eyes open. Gott. What the fuck? Hey! Come on. Hurry up. You're one crazy cracker, you know that? Fire, fire. Hey, hey, hey, look out, look out, look out. Lieutenant. Get me anything you can on the whereabouts of the 755th and where the hell those goddamn German panzer tanks are! Are you okay, son? My whole platoon is in the 755th. Our last communication was yesterday. Nothing. Listen up, son. Those boys you care about so much, they need you now more than ever. Understood? - Right, sir. - Okay, lieutenant. You found out where they are and then get 'em back in the fight. Yes sir. All right, listen up, all of ya. We're still in this fight and I don't want to see any more defeated faces around me, understood? Yes sir. All right, carry on. Attention! Continue gentlemen, don't let me stop you. General. Looks like we are in the thick of it, eh Mike? Well I hate to say so, Brad but it would seem that way. Weather blew in a major German offensive, eh? Yeah, a bitter cold wind. Give it to me straight. Well, all reports said the same thing. Infantry, tanks, artillery, everything and well, they're right down the elsenborn road, they're coming down the Gavin road and the andar bridge. You don't think this is a feint? No, it's not infantry doing reconnaissance enforces. These are crack panzer divisions, I think Hitler's last reserves. And your division is in retreat? Well, tactical withdrawal, we're referring it as. Do we have any available resistance? Any units that can muster a defense? No, only small isolated units, platoons, companies doing what they can to stop the advance. I'm afraid that our flanks are exposed and they could surround us. Reserves? Unknown. I mean, we can't keep a comm wire up more than five minutes, much less lay a new one down. If they have our flanks, then they can cross the meuse river. Right, and if they cross the meuse river, they can go all the way to antwerp and cut off the english channel at our backs and separate us from the British who are up in Holland on our left. Our armies would be trapped behind German lines without any hope for resupply. Ike wants to know what I want to do. But I want to know what you want to do. - May I speak my mind? - Speak it. It just doesn't make any sense. What doesn't? Well, if the Germans are going to try to make it all the way to antwerp, they're gonna have to refuel. Those panzers use a lot of fuel. Lieutenant. We need current fuel reserve estimates of the German army. Hold on son, you're gonna want to pay attention to this. We're making history here. If you're right, if he is right, then the Germans are going to want to refuel with our gas which is, where is it? Well, our biggest reserve is right here, just north of lanzerath. Which is where? Right down the elsenborn road. I think you're onto something there, Mike. Carry on. Get me those numbers, son. All right, you boys wait here. We'll go on ahead and see what we can do to help you all out. It just doesn't make any sense. I know, what the hell are these mps doing walking around in the woods? Yeah, and you see the markings on that Jeep? Uh-huh. That's one of our headquarters jeeps. I mean it could be, there's a lot of jeeps around. It could be a coincidence. Success? I got them out. Why are they here? Why didn't you just kill 'em and be done with it? These men might be useful. Fine. Keep 'em alive, for now. Yes, sir. Looks like I got you boys a ride. Right this way. What about food? All you can eat. - What do you want to do? - I don't know. We don't have a choice now. Jack. Now you boys be sure to keep your eyes peeled. Them Germans, they're everywhere. Welcome back, lieutenant. You're lucky. The bullet barely grazed your side. I had to sew you up myself. Couple of days rest and you should be okay. Where am I? Field hospital, lanzerath, or what's left of it. Thanks for fixing me up, ma'am. But I really gotta get going. You shouldn't be moving yet. The stitches need time to set. Lieutenant cappa can't die. He's got the lord on his side. Doc. It's good to see you too, sir. I found these. How? I was picked up by a patrol and I was brought here. I decided to stick around and help out where I could. I really appreciate the fix, ma'am. I just can't stop... Here, you'll need this. Change the old with the new in the next 24 hours. Harris has the command room set up in the mill house, you can't miss it. Who has command? - Sergeant Harris. - No officers? I'm the ranking officer here, lieutenant but they don't take field orders from nurses. Captain, I didn't mean- - yeah, he didn't mean nothing by it. It's okay, lieutenant. Change that bandage or I will find you and change it myself. Yes, captain. - Good to see you, doc. - Sir. Do you think he knows? If he doesn't, he will soon enough. Attention. At ease, fellas. Glad you're still with us, lieutenant. Thanks to you. What's your name? Gene cappa. I figured any man able to keep ahead of the whole damn German army is a man worth saving, lieutenant cappa. Graze wound, hurts like hell, don't it? Ain't no ticket home though. No, it's not. And even if it was a million dollar wound, no one seems to be going home these days. Are you the ranking nco? Yes sir. Any officers? We lost lieutenant Briggs a few days back. Just us now, 350 field artillery. At least what's left of us. Where's your guns? Destroyed. We have a few long tommys and a handful of rounds between us. Just you coloreds? We picked up a few white doughs a day or two ago but we have 'em spread out along our checkpoints. Is it as bad as it looks, sir? We haven't had any contact in a long time. The Germans are making a major push this way. Heavy infantry, tanks, artillery all coming this way. The last orders I received, hold at all costs. So it's like that? So it seems, sergeant. We created a few makeshift checkpoints and choke points around our perimeter and we're here in the middle. The Germans have been probing all along our lines trying to cut off our position. I mean hell, it's probably already cut off now and they're just trying to take it. Artillery? Incoming I guess but they're either short or long, nothing too close. But they don't have you zeroed in? It's not that, sir. They know exactly where to hit us. Well if they have you cut off, why aren't they advancing? I'll show you. This is the largest fuel supply within 1520 miles I reckon. Why didn't you blow it? A black man destroying army property? No sir, no orders to do that yet. What do you think we should do, sir? What do you mean? Well, I mean no disrespect but you are the only officer here. What's the best route into town? The main road coming in. All right, let's go have a look. Any sign of the Germans? No, not on these roads. Sully. You're alive. Well they haven't killed me yet. I can see they've tried. - Are these your boys? - What's left of 'em. The Germans hit us hard, we scattered and fell back. A lot of that going around. Nowhere left to run, sir. All right, show me what you got. Sir, we have a plane in the sky. One of our best pilots. Braxton four, Braxton four, little blue, over. Braxton four, we copy. Captain, what do you see up there? Thick soup, sir. I don't know how much longer we can stay up here, over. Waters, they say that you're the best, can fly through anything, rain, snow, sleet or hail, over. The best? Is that how I volunteered for this mission? Qver. Captain, you are my eyes and I'm blind down here, over. If you don't mind me, sir, what are we doing up here? You're looking for the goddamn German army, waters. We need to know if it's a major offensive, over. So what am I looking for? Over. You'll know it when you see it, over. Copy that, over and out. Goddamn fly boy. I'd like to get him down here with the 2nd division. Sir. - Private? - Quiet. Germans, they're crawling over there. Plane sir, that's one of ours. How can you tell? The low hum of that engine, that's one of our scout planes, no doubt about it. A scout plane, huh? I'd like to try something. Little blue, little blue, over. Little blue, little blue, over. Little blue, little blue, come in. - Major? - Daniels, is that you? Jeez, it's good to hear your voice, sir. Where are you? In a recon plane in the clouds. We're looking for the enemy. I must be in range of your plane, sir. If you're looking for the Germans, they're not too far away. You see them? They're right in front of me, sir. We're gonna try to get a better view. We'll keep trying, you keep the line open. Roger that, sir. Well get underneath the clouds. I don't know what is underneath me, sir. We could run into a tree, that'll end this real fast. Waters, just do it. My, that is a lot of Germans. Confirmed. It looks like the whole damn German army. Location 479 south 687. Repeat. south 687. Sir, I can't stay up here much longer. That's all I need, captain. Get out of there, come on home. Copy that. Did you get that, sir? Over. Sir? Over. Dammit! Ok, it's time to go. Just trying to keep the ice off her, sir. But she sure will run smooth. He rounds mostly, sir, though we do have a handful of ap rounds. The boys and I scrapped up everything we could, couldn't we, boys? Does it drive? Shot, sir. Drive wheel hit by a German mine. It was a hell of a time getting it out here. No, the tranny's done. This is our girl's last resting place. Old logger road, not many people know about this spot except for the locals. We thought it'd be best to move the tank here. But if the locals know about it, the krauts know about it. Yeah, but it doesn't appear to be in action. So cool, should be a surprise when they come down this way. The valley creek should protect us from the east and the mines should protect our south flank. You know about those mines. The Germans will have a tough time coming through here. Damn right. But they will come. We're low on ammunition, not much for tank defense. No hope for friendly fire, artillery or reinforcements. Sir, we can hold these positions. We can fight. The Germans haven't attacked in force and they will and then what? What's left? Who's left? My platoon was ambushed. King tiger came out of the woods, took everyone out. These guys here, these men, these are are all we got. But sir, I just, I want to fight back. I owe my men that, I owe myself that. No, I'm losing no more men on my watch. Get your platoons off the line, pull out in 30. Yes, sir. Linens, bandages, syrettes, morphine and plasma. How much longer? Maybe enough for another day, maybe two if we're lucky. Ma'am, we don't have much left of anything. Food, water, maybe three days more is all. Find the ones that take priority. We ration the rest, make do the best we can. Yes, ma'am. Something else, hope? No ma'am, it's just that, well, how can we help these men? Take it one day at a time. I stopped the bleeding but we need more ab negative. We are out. No, we aren't. - Matthew. - Mary, it's okay. I can make more. Hell, it is the lieutenant. We knew you were too tough for those krauts, sir. When we didn't run into you in the woods, we thought the worst. Hey, where's rock? Rock didn't make it. He was a good man. He was. Lieutenant, are you the one in charge here? Yes, sir. This depot is still intact, guns, fuel, ammunition? Yes sir but we were just about to blow it. Sir, I gave the orders to blow the depot. Leave nothing for the Germans. Well that's very smart lieutenant, very smart indeed. I mean them Germans, they'll be here any minute. But y'all don't have to worry about anything else. Just make sure you don't leave anything on the way out, all right? Sir, I've already given the orders. Well the orders have changed, lieutenant. We'll handle this. Sir, we have wounded and they need to leave. We'll get them evacuated as soon as possible. Sir, may I speak... I'm sorry. Am I the lieutenant or are you? All right, when I say "jump," you say "how high?" That's how this works, all right? I'm in charge. Tell me you understand, do you understand? Do you understand me? But sir, we have critical wounded and I'm not leaving without 'em. Let me know if you need a hand. Thank you, sir. See you around the depot. We're with you, sir. Let's start gathering the wounded. Well, that confirms it. Major German offensive, tanks and troops in the thousands. Recon was a success? The elsenborn Ridge is the northern edge of the German offensive. All they gotta do is swing up from the north and cut us and the British off. Yes but if we could form a bottleneck on that road, we might be able to force the Germans southeast and patton and his 3rd army are down there. Yeah, but that won't stop 'em. Well maybe not but sir, I have to say that's rough terrain. Thick forests, thin intersecting logging roads. The Germans will have a hell of a time trying to supply their tanks there. I'll report this back to ike, see what he wants to do. Okay. Now there have been some disturbing reports of english-speaking Germans dressed in American military uniforms moving in and out of our lines. Krauts pretending to be Americans? Speak pretty good english too. That's troubling. Command has been put on high alert. That bad? Yet to be seen. Mike, it's good work. Doc? That's the last of those that can be moved, sir. The rest need to stay where they are. Sir, I'd like to request to stay behind. Are you sure? Yes, sir. You're not authorized to take that Jeep. This is one of ours, it belongs to our hq. Sergeant, this does belong to us. I'm sorry sir, I can't let you take that Jeep. What's the problem here? Sir, this Jeep belongs to our division and we need it to move out our wounded. Request denied, lieutenant. We need these vehicles to conduct our operations. You and your boys, the wounded, y'all are gonna have to walk out of here. Well then we're not leaving, sir. Are you disobeying an order? No, sir. Just waiting for clarification. Well fine, go ahead. Take 'em. We're running out of time anyway. Gentlemen. Sir, something's a little bit off about our new friends here. You might need this. All right, let's move out. Let's go. Inform haufsfuehrer Piper that the petrol supply is ours. And the American outposts? Any remaining, see that they're disposed of. What do you want us to do with the remaining American wounded? - Them too. - Yes, sir. What do you got for us, sarge? They gonna reinforce us? We're falling back, Jax. It be that bad? No, just tactical withdrawal. Keep the men low. I don't want the krauts to know what we're up to. Outposts? Pull 'em last. Sure thing, sarge. This is my war now. Haufsfuehrer Piper, sir. Hello, sir. Yes sir, I'm looking at it right now. Yes, sir. Advance into town. We'll be ready, out. Get them boys on the petrol first. - I don't want a drop spilled. - Yes, sir. Take the lead out of your boots, sergeant. Come on, get a move on. What are we standing around for? Let's go, come on. I have to do everything around here. Sir. Get your men prepared to move off the line. We're blowing the depot. But what about the Germans? We're gonna regroup, then link up. Are you okay with that? Yeah. The mps, they're just gonna have to handle it from here. - Yes sir. - Someone gimme a hand. Daniels? Captain. Hell of a day to find you. Let's get him to this Jeep. - Get water, water. - Here you go, sir. Heavy German infantry and army coming down the road. It's a good thing we found you then, sir. Hey, we're getting outta here, pulling out. Hey, where'd you find this? Mps in town, sir. Figured it was one of ours. Military police? That's right. This is my Jeep. This is my Jeep. My men were ambushed by military police. They killed everyone, I managed to get away. You think those are the same guys? It had to be. This is my headquarters Jeep. You guys came in with them, what do you think? Something sure did seem off about 'em, sir. If they're German, sir, we gotta go back. Sully, we got heavy German armor coming down the road. Tanks, half-tracks, half the damn German army. - How were they looking? - Sergeant? Were they expecting a fight? I don't know, sarge. They don't know we're here. I suppose they didn't seem ready for a fight. What do you think, gene? We can't leave the depot. So what do we do, run and hide or do we stay and fight? We have to fight. What's your plan, lieutenant? - Gimme some runners. - Yes sir. Okay, listen up. I want everybody locked and loaded, all right? If we gotta shoot our way out of this place, we need to be ready. Sir, m1 garand. I haven't shot one of those since basic. Give me something else. Okay uh, all right. How about a grease gun? That's something else. Hey, what's going on, private? - Check in on frequency 473. - What's it say? "The Germans are preparing." Hold fire until the last minute and then we fall back. We're blowing the depot. "Good luck, gene." We fight? We fight. Hey, we fight. Tell cappa's men we are ready. Right, sarge. - What now? - Ready the tank. Let's make sure they don't see us unaware. Hey, it's the lieutenant. We heard you had a change of heart, sir. Those American mps, yeah, they're Germans in American uniforms those sneaky kraut bastards. Germans are coming in thinking they hold the town. We're gonna get the jump on 'em, they're gonna be mad as hell. Yeah, we've been ready for this. When you hear the depot explode, that's your signal to fall back. - Hell yeah. - Good luck, sergeant. Yes sir. We're going to war. - Hey Rudy, Rudy? - Yeah. Where's that Wayne kid? Haven't seen him. Everybody's ready, cap. All right, when we get into town, let me do all the talking. If there needs to be any shooting, wait for my signal. Yes sir. You sure you're ready for this? I'm the only one they won't recognize. Just make sure we have time to blow that depot. Germans coming in. That's our cue. Good luck. The men are ready, sir. Good. Think the Germans will fall for it? Think these will help? This can work. This will work. Is there a problem, soldier? Say that again, private. Hell of a thing, sarge. The Germans are coming and our officers are looking at fighting them. Checkpoints are still up? It's looking that way, sir. And they sent you back here to tell us that? Not exactly. I figured shooting it out here would be better than in the woods. You did good, private. You did good. Okay, okay. All right boys, wait for it. Come on. Come on. Here you go, here you go. We're all friends here. Oh boy. Hey, the krauts are coming. Hey sarge! Eyes forward. Sarge, what's going on! The krauts are making a push, be on the ready. Get ready boys, get ready. Rifles at the ready, no one fires until I give the signal. That judge ready? Jury's in session. Sir, we got a problem. What is it? The Americans still hold the checkpoints. Get command on the radio now. What are you doing standing here still? I don't care if you've gotta walk barefoot, get your butt out there and do something. What do you got, lead in your boots? Let's go, on the double. Goddammit! Come on, guys. You're sure this is gonna work, right? - It's gonna work. - All right. Just keep smiling and waving like an idiot. Wait for it. Wait for it. Wait for it. All right, time's up. Hit it! Go, on the double, move. Ford, neuhardt, on the western flank. Scott, pike, I want you on the south. Look sharp. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. What can I do for you, captain? Hi. Hey! Wait for it. Now! Hit 'em! - Fire! - On the way. Reload. Hit 'em again. Again, hit 'em again. Here they come! No one fires until I give the signal. Hold it. Hold it. Fire! Sir, we're under attack. - Ready? - Yes sir. Just get me there and I'll do the rest, sir. Just wait for my signal. Covering fire. Pour it on 'em! Again, hit 'em again. I'm running low on the 30. All right, I'm on the 50. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! - Form a perimeter. - Yes, corporal. - How long? - Five minutes to set the charge, five minutes to get the hell out of dodge. - Just say 10 minutes. - You worry about the time. - Let me worry about this. - I'll cover you. Covering fire! Running low on ammo, sarge, 60s. How much longer we gotta hold 'em? When we get the signal. Get us out of here, lieutenant. You sure this is a good idea, sir? Best idea I've had in the war. Yeah, I heard about boucage. I hated the boucage. Sir, how many shots we got? Two. Better make them count. All right, let's go, let's go! Corporal, we've got a problem here. What is it, pavlov? My timing device, it's not working. - What does that mean? - That means someone has to stay behind to do it manually. I'll do it. Oh no, no. Wayne, what the hell happened? I'I do it, I'll stay behind. No Wayne, we can't just leave you here. Please, let me do this. Okay. Five minutes. Thank you. It's okay, go. Let's move out. Let's go, go. Jack, there! I'm ready. All right, let's go. Can't keep this up much longer. - Did it work? - Like a charm. Five minutes, this town lights up like Christmas. Move out! The petrol, the petrol, the petrol! Go, go, go, go, go, go. The petrol, the petrol! Go, go, go! Don't move! That's the signal, fall back, fall back. - That's the signal. - Everybody, move it. Fall back, fall back. Sir, the general. - Attention. - At ease, sir. Mike. How was your trip? Any trouble? No, no, no trouble. Though I did find myself detained by the military police as a suspected German infiltrator. Oh, how's that? What's the capital of Illinois? Springfield. Yeah, so I thought myself. Which is when I suspected this young man as he himself being an infiltrator. That or a product of poor education. Or simply harboring fond memories of a trip to Chicago. We're determining the rates presently. But these krauts, I tell you, they've got us all twisted up. They're cutting wires, they're turning road signs, they're sending us all Willy-nilly. And 376th regiments through walerscheild. And? And the krauts switched all the road signs. Half the division turned up in Frankfurt. Oh god, and what about our artillery? Half made it, half got jammed in the rear. Jesus, what did lke say? We're gonna meet to discuss the options. Mike, you've been in the thick of it. What would you do? Where do we make our stand? Bastogne, all reinforcements to bastogne and that's where we make our stand. I'll tell the general. And sir? Thank you, sir. You know, I said it before, Mike and I'm gonna say it now, perhaps hopefully with more meaning. Thank you. Major. What are your orders, sir? We're going to bastogne, haas, prepare my Jeep. Yes sir. All right, listen up everyone. Orders to all units, turn and fight. Stop the Germans or at least try to slow 'em down. We need to buy time. Send out the order, now. Yes sir. Bastogne. Is this all that's left? Good to see you, sergeant. Hell of a show captain but next time, make it quicker. I'll take that under consideration. East, the roads are open east. - Bastogne? - Bastogne. All right, get in. We don't have any time to lose. Mount up!
