He's gone all to pieces and lost his head. Don't panic, Penfold! I'm just over here at Fourth Dimension. - Eh? - Um... well, my head is. Look here, you fiend! I don't know how... Henry, would you please hurry up! Okay. Down in a minute. Same every morning! Stupid old trains! Yes, he's removed the door and the demon to Alpha Centauri. Hello? Hello? Mummy! Oh, please. Oh please, stop. Please. Please, stop! Please! You stinking fat bastard! I'll catch up, don't worry! Pig! - Henry, for goodness' sakes! - Coming! And this is a model engine. Let's see what's inside, shall we? You see, there are four tubes called cylinders, and inside each cylinder is a kind of plunger called a piston. You see? Have you got that, Chumley? The engine has four cylinders, and inside each cylinder is a plunger called a piston. Okay, Mr Whoopee, go ahead. Oh! Well, a little gas and air come into the cylinder. Now, gas is very, very explosive. So when a spark plug in the top of the cylinder makes a spark... Interesting? Not to you. Try me. Come on, Linda. You don't want to know about my hobby. I can't care if you don't talk to me about it. Can't I? Hmm? You baiting me? Now, why would I do a thing like that? Chooga-chooga-chuff-chuff... Hey ho. Hey ho. Linda, what's wrong here? - You'll be late at the clinic. - Again. Bye-bye, sugar. See you at six. - Have a nice day, Henry. - Bye-bye, sugar. See you at six. Surprise, surprise. Come soon. Oh, come today. I have to say it. I don't normally approve of the disfigurement involved in tattoos. - What? - But I wholly approve of yours. It's admirable! Just what the hell are you trying to say? The simple word, "Mom". The way you've got the word "Mom" across the heart like that. Listen, fella, you just don't jump up a man's truck and start talking about his tattoo. That's some bad judgement. I presume you love, or loved, your mother? What?! I take it you had feelings of the warmest possible affection for your mother? Yeah. I did. Everybody should have a mother. But I never knew mine. They took me away when I was only two or three days old. Where to? The funny farm? Yes. Two days old. Think of it. I was born in this country, you know. I should have had my childhood here. But they took me away. "...I don't give a frog shit." To the Minister! Look, I said, I've got to live in this town. At least you don't have to tidy up his toys. Rather have that. You ever wish you were someplace else? Okay, buddy. This is where you're getting out. What? I'm putting you down here. Erm... but... what? Listen, fella. You ain't done nothing but run your damn mouth for the last hour and I ain't understood but about half of what you said. I didn't want you to feel lonely. Look here, fella, this is a little old biddy town. There ain't nothing happening here at all. So they ought to be damned glad to get you. Now get your ass out. You think I talk too much. Is that it? Nooo! But that don't matter none, good buddy. What? I'm just practising. I don't want to stand out like a sore thumb, do I? Who's that mother? I'm that mother! Go on, get out! Thanks. Well, I guess maybe they're thinking of doing it more like last year. Always the same. They just go on and on and on... Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh. - Good morning, Dr Henry. - Good morning. Oh, I didn't notice you, Bernard. Good morning! Why don't you try a little harder, Henry? Pretty soon you'll be able to say "good afternoon" when you arrive. You wouldn't happen to have such a thing as egg and chips, by any chance, would you? - What? - I mean, erm... Shit, what do I mean? Ah, fried egg and French fries. Sure. How do you want your egg? - I beg your pardon? - Easy over, or what? - Do I have an alternative? - Do you have what? That will be fine. Splendid. Ta very much. What's "easy over"? Are you English? Um... is it that obvious? I mean, I've scarcely opened my mouth. You don't mind, do you? - No. - Do you? No. Go ahead. As long as you don't think I'm being impertinent or anything gross like that, but there's something about your face that sort of reassures me. - I'm not intrusive, am I? - No. - Am I? - No, of course not. How do you do, Madam? My name is Martin. And spot on, quite right, jolly shrewd. I'm from England. I've come all the way across the pond in search of my mama. Oh, hi. I'm Linda. Well, welcome to America. Hey. - This is my friend Arlanda. - Hi. Arlanda. Arlanda? Isn't that the name of an airport? Hello, Arlanda. Come in, please! Are you receiving me, Arlanda? I don't know. Is it? Yes. It is. Stockholm. In Sweden, you know. I'm not sure I like having the same name as an airport. It's better than a railway station. What is it? What's the matter? No, no, nothing. There's not something on my face, is there? I haven't got a bogey on my nose, have I? No. I remind you of someone, don't I? - No... - Don't I? Yes. Yes, I do. Well, it was real nice meeting with you. I hope you really have a nice vacation. - Oh, are you going? - I'm going. - But I will see you again, won't I? - We've got to go. I will see you. I will. - Yeah, we'd better go now, sir. - I doubt it. - Excuse me, sir. - Well, I don't. I certainly don't. Jesus Christ... Enjoy. Shut up! Piggy. Little piggy. No... Daddy? Daddykins? Which ickle-lickle naughty ickle girl wants to be a bad lickle girl? No, Linda. Daddy... Ickle Linda can't go bye-byes. Not now, Linda. I've hardly had a wink of sleep. Ooh, but I'm a naughty ickle girl. Daddy... - Daddykins! - Oh, for goodness sakes! What the hell! Oh, for Christ's sake, Henry, you're so goddamn boring! What's the matter, Linda? Linda, I'm tired. Chooga-chooga-chuff-chuff! Linda, would you put the light out? You know I can't sleep with the light on. Linda... He's outside, you know. He's come back. He's outside, and he's waiting. Oh no he isn't! Linda? Linda? Linda? Linda? Why are you looking at me like that? Like what? It's not exactly a friendly look, now, is it? Have I, er... upset you in some way? You sure have. Daddys'll smackoo. Daddykins will smack little Linda... - No! Not that! - I, uh, I thought that... My God, Henry. You're so obtuse! Yes. I guess I am. I'm not one of your geriatric patients, you know. No... You're so used to treating those old has-beens, or... or playing with your trains. I do not play with my trains. Well, what do you do with them, then? Every morning, every evening, it's driving me crazy! "Unreasonable" is a better word. You're being unreasonable. You didn't even use that... that pretty little snowplough I bought you for your birthday. It's a Canadian Pacific snowplough. I don't have a Canadian Pacific loco. There. You see? You see? We know nothing whatsoever about each other. Nothing! We'll talk about this later. Henry. Henry, I need that child. I want that baby! Linda... I'm suffocating. I'll just die without that baby. It is not, not, I repeat, not possible. We've got this big house. You're a doctor. We're good people. We could give it... him... everything a child could possibly want. No, Linda. Love, security, everything. It is not possible. I can't go on like this any more. It's just so empty. There's no shape. No purpose. You know very well no agency, no court anywhere is going to allow us to adopt a child, and you also know why. You cruel bastard! If you say so. You're selfish, Henry! Totally and completely selfish! Now stop getting yourself worked up. We've had all this out at least a hundred times. Why get overwrought? Bye-bye, sugar. See you at six. - I'll kill myself! - Yeah, yeah, sure... I'll be at the bottom of the pool! I mean it! My baby! Bastard! What did you say? What? Did I hear the word "bastard" from your fair lips? It's not a word that I care to hear, myself. Gets too personal. But, as the Bard said, "God, stand up for bastards!" - What the hell are you... - Hello. Hello? What do you mean, hello? I suppose I ought to have brought a big bunch of flowers. What do you want? How did you... A bouquet of English roses, red and thorny. No, a bunch of forget-me-nots! How did you get in here? What are you doing? You almost overdid it, didn't you? No air left in your lungs. You might even be dead. Hmm? - What are you... - You are Mrs Linda Alice Henry, are you not? - I'll call the police! - Who used to be Linda Alice Carter. - Correct? - How did you... Look, you haven't told me who you are, or what you want, or what you were doing staring up at this house last night. You're so much younger, and so much more beautiful than I ever imagined. Who are you? I've come a long, long way to find you, Linda Alice Carter. Do I know you from... We were very, very close once upon a time. As close as close can be. Do you not remember the tug of my lips on your tender young breast? I'll do this for you, Nurse Stein, if you'll do the same for me! Okay, Mr Ennis. Come on, darlin'. Up on the table. You got a nice piece there, don't you? - Nurse Stein, please. - Jealous, Doc? - Hey! Never mind that needle! - I forgot to ask you to call my wife. You want me to call your wife? Oho! That's the way it is, huh? Tell her I'll, well... I'll be home late. Very late. I didn't have an opportunity to, um... I forgot our little gathering this evening. You forgot the Trainorama? Well, one should sometimes be economical with the truth. I'll do this for you, Nurse Stein, if you do the same for me. I'll do better than that, Henry. - Hey! - Mr Ennis? Is there something you like about my butt? - What? - You want to keep on looking at it? You want I should keep it stuck up here in the air all day long? Now, now, now, now, now, Mr Ennis. Hold still, please. Holy shit! That hurt! There. That should do nicely. Our plucky heroes left on their perilous quest. - Harry felt a little confused. - Yeah, must be the tropic zone. Er... no, it's my watch. Anyway, although they scoured the area, not a sign of Zero did they find. No sense in going any further. Let's... Aren't you the nice lady, then? Aren't you at all the kind of woman I always thought you were. Be so kind as to cast your mind back to the summer of rock and free love. - What? - The end of flower power. Scruffy sods giving each other daffodils and the clap. Peace, and all that shit. Remember? What were you doing then? I was at school. Bet you were good at biology. What? The reproductive system. It can't be. It can't be. I'm very tired, you know. I'm very, very tired. I mean, I've spent all my life looking for you. As well as all my money. For God's sake please, who are you? I'm your little baby boy, Mummy dear. My baby? My little pink baby? Mother... It's blown the whole building away. But at least there's my Junior, my little boy. I... I don't know whether to believe you or not. No? I can't... - I can't take it all in. - You abandoned me! Didn't you? - I... - Well? I had no choice. I had no choice. No choice. No choice. I didn't! No choice, no rights, no nothing! I was taken over and humiliated and bullied! Made to feel the dirtiest, wickedest... I was a schoolgirl. Pregnant schoolgirl. Somebody who didn't know what to do, or where to go, or who to turn to... or how to escape, or nothing! A very scared little girl, with an overbearing father and a dimwit mama... Come on, hey. Come on... There hasn't been a day since I haven't thought about what happened, or what should have happened. I spy! I spy with my little eye something beginning with... B! What are you do... Don't be ridiculous! - Please play with me, Mummy! - No! Something beginning with B. Now, think! What's the matter? - What are you pulling a face for? - Let go of my wrist! I'm only playing. How do I know you are who you say you are? You could have followed me from that diner, or... could have found out about me. Two days after I was born, which was May 17th, my birthday, I was given to a middle-aged couple called Brennan. You know. She was a cleaning woman in your mum's house. But within a year... back to England. With me. Little me. Then it's true. My child! Where's my child? - There's no reason to fear! - It's really true! Underdog is here! I've got a new cassette I want to play. It's the most fantastic... You sure this isn't going to give you cardiac arrest one of these mornings? Hurry up. Hurry up! You want me to lock the door, don't you? Be patient, Doctor. She wanted me to be daddy again last night. It just disgusts me. It does not come easy to me. It's not what I like at all. Wait, wait, wait! There's a terrific bit coming up. Now! - I spy with my little... - No! Now you cut it out. I mean it! Hey! What... where'd you go? Martin? Martin? I'll be all right... be all right. Be. All. Right. - Guess who? - God, you scared me! Why don't you like games, Mummy? - Martin loves games. - Well, I don't! What's the matter with you, anyway? Are you out of your mind? Oh, don't say that. Don't ever say that. I've been ill. That's all. Sort of. Ill? How do you mean, ill? - Where are we going? - What? In this nice car. Where are you taking me? I hope it's somewhere exciting. Well, you'll just have to wait and see, won't you? I'm not a bit like you thought I am, am I? Eh? It's the shock just beginning to hit me, I... - I never thought... - Something beginning with B. - What? - Do you give up? Well, do you give up? - What are you talking about? - Something beginning with B. You can't guess it, so... you give up. Right? Oh, this is no fun. This is no fun at all. What sort of mummy are you, anyway? And where are we going? - To the clinic. - What? - I must see my husband. I have to. - No! - Stop it! - No! We are not going to any clinic. Well, my husband is there. I have to talk to him. No clinic! No doctors! Nothing medical whatsoever! No... maybe not. Definitely not! What is it? Are you going to make up for lost time? How... how do you mean? All the years. All those years. The lost years. Martin, how can I? - I'm sick to death of being grown up. - What? You owe me. Oh, certainly you owe me. Definitely you do. - Or am I just the dirty little secret? - No. Don't say that. You mustn't say that. You've never been that, not to me. You can kiss me, if you want. You can kiss me. I mustn't get drunk. Henry says I have to stop drinking. You never cuddled me, did you? And you never played peep-bo. And you never kissed it better. Kissed what better? - My knee. - Oh. Did you... You never brought me a light in the dark, and you never waited outside the school gate, and you never let me follow your finger along the line of... nice, big words. Oh please, what words? "Once upon a time." All that stuff. You know, kids' stuff. - I used to tell you stories in my head. - Yes, ma'am? I wasn't talking to you. - No? - No. Did you really? Did you really and truly? Yeah. Snow White, Rumpelstiltskin. That sort of stuff. Yes. Would you tell me one now? Will you tell me one for real? Will you? Will you? "Once upon a time..." Come on. Come on. "Once upon a time..." Scary. Excuse me. She's sitting there talking to herself with tears in her eyes. Long, long ago, there was a little girl who was as pretty as she was good, and she was so very, very excited, 'cause her mama told her the fair was coming to the town, with wooden horses, going up and down... up... And the bumper cars... the bumper cars... There was this young man, he was helping with the bumper cars. Yeah. And... Come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on. No. I can't. Come on! Oh, come on! I don't know how to. I've never done this before. Please don't. No. Don't. I've never done this before. Please... Come on! Come on baby! Come on! Come on! Yes... yes... yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! What am I gonna do now? Who shall I tell? What shall I say? Oh, you wicked bastard! My baby... Would you like a drink, or...? A drink? Do you think I should? Well, no, maybe, um... yes, wash your hands. Wash my hands? Do I have to wash my hands? Not... not if you don't want to, I... - I just thought that... - Are you going to make me? - Look, why are you behaving like this? - I don't want to wash! I don't want to! And I won't! I won't! I won't! Now, Martin, stop this this minute, do you hear me? I mean it! - Am I a naughty boy? - Yes, Martin, you are! Come here! Are you going to make Martin go bye-byes? Are you going to put me to bed? Are you? Mummy. Mummy. Do forgive me, Bernard. I know you said to come at once, but old Mrs Hanwell was being more than usually difficult. And, well, here I am. - Mrs Hanwell? - Yes. - Varicose veins, isn't it? - Yes. Varicose veins. No, amend that. Varicose brain. Well, do sit down. Please. Yes. Thank you. - Er... is it anything in particular? - No, in general. Nothing serious, I trust? - Doctor Henry... - Mmm. - What's the matter? - Doctor? Rather formal, Bernard. At eleven-fifteen this morning, you gave Mr Ennis an injection. - Yes. - Could you tell me what it was? Ooh, er... Penicillin, yes. I thought he had... - You know what this is? - Yes, of course. Then read it. I should have checked, of course. But I... But? Well, I know, of course I'm sorry... Mr Ennis quite rightly says your mind is not entirely on your work. - Well... - How's your wife nowadays, Henry? She's, er... Perhaps your domestic situation is affecting your professional life? I don't think so. I don't think you have any right to say these things, Bernard. No? Everybody makes the occasional error. Oh. By the way, I'm going to have to let Nurse Stein go. You understand my meaning? Ah... I, er... you're referring to... my therapy..., I... Therapy? Your therapy? Is that what you call it? Er... s-s-sciatica. The sciatic nerve. - Extremely... - Painful, yes. He never does anything interesting. Poor Henry. Very, very nice, but... boring. What you marry him for, then? Mummy? I needed to. That's all. Hey! - What are you doing? - Playing. I'm playing. I like playing! Yes... I've decided to have my American childhood. What? I am entitled to an American childhood. ...trying to get the crowd wound up here a little bit. They're having a great time. Look at the smiles on their faces. Ball of energy today. Maybe next year, if we're here for the parade still... Spoiled! Choo-choo! Pampered! Over-indulged. The whole package, as you people say. I've been utterly fed up with being a grown-up for a long time now. What do you mean? There's no fun in it. There's no magic. There's not even any marbles, or kites, or bedtime stories. There's nothing. But that's how it... What? Just... yakety-yak! Yakety-yak! About bombs, and interest rates, and... stuff like that, from old geezers with prostrate trouble... fucking up the world. Being a kid again is as good an occupation as any. It's better. In fact, it's a pretty good career! Like Princess Diana. That what you mean? Got to work at it. You can't expect it to be easy. I'm going to try really hard. Who wants to dig prostate glands out all day, anyway? On my terms. In my way. You've compromised my dignity. - Looking forward to the speech. I really am. - Oh, thank you. Thank you. Hell, I've been looking forward to this evening for so long. I mean, the honour of the keynote address and everything. - But now... - I didn't call her. What? What do you mean? Why? Why not? - It's time we stopped pretending. - Look, I'm all strung up. I've lost my job. I'm worried about this speech. Bull! I'm not backing out, but this has got to be done my way. - Bull! - Bull? This is it. You either leave that neurotic drunk or... Or what? Or I'll never lay another finger on you again. Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! And now, without further ado, let me introduce our national leader, Doctor Henry Henry! Thank you, thank you! When the ignorant and the ill-informed say to me, and they sometimes do say to me, if they can find the time to empty their heads from the soap and the football on TV, when they say, "Fancy! A grown man, "a doctor, playing with toy trains." - Do you know what I feel? - What do you feel? - Shall I tell you what I feel? - Tell us! I feel damned sorry for them! Yes, I'm proud of my model railroad! Yes! I'm proud of the mental discipline. The intellectual hygiene of perfectly scaled miniaturisation. For there, in the layout, is the record writ small of what built this great nation! Shining tracks from shining shore to shining shore. Whoo! Okay! And I say to you, I say... as I close my eyes at night, the day's work done, the troubles all at bay, I see a picture of my little train coming down the track, a picture of long ago, when we knew who we were! What we were! And where we were going! Thank you, thank you. Pardon me... ♪ Pardon me, boy, ♪ Is that the Chattanooga Choo-Choo? ♪ Yes! Yes! Track 29! - All aboard! - All aboard! All aboard! All aboard! All aboard! Hello! All aboard! All aboard! Fantastic! Whoo-whoo! Fantastic! Yes! Yes! The Oxnard Shores to Lompoc train labours a little on the incline! Good and high! The signal bell tolls! Clang-clang! Clang-clang! Clang-clang! Clang-clang! The whistle a-blowing! Whoo! Whoo! That's it! That's it. Yeah, yeah! I'll catch you on the way back. Out of the darkness she comes... ...into the light! God bless the model railroaders of America! Bastions of innocence! Of decency! Of healthy family life! Mummy... - You can't catch me! - Yes, I can! I won! I won! Yes, you did! I'm fast, I am. Mmm, aren't you a clever one? Am I a good boy? Am I? Am I? I don't know. Won't play. Oh, please! Well... I feel like I've turned some sort of corner. You know that guy who was talking to me after my speech? Truman. He runs a modelling factory. Makes everything from locos to little animals. Including hogs? The point is, he's offered me a job. If I can p-p-put up... Er... he's undercapitalised. - Nasty complaint. - Yes. Well... of course, I'd have to relocate. And you, too. What do you mean? Well... up there, on that platform, all those upturned faces loving me. They did. They truly did. Made me realise a few things. Personal things. - Like what? - Like knowing who I am. What I want, and who I want. Especially who. - Or is it whom? - Who? It's not whom? I've never known about that one. Grammar's always been a problem for me, and yet you can't say that I'm not well educated... Henry! What's the matter now? - Who, Henry? Who?! - If you say so. Oh! Oh! Well, you, of course.

Arlanda? Oh, Arlanda, thank God! Arlanda, help me. - Arlanda, please come over. - What? - Please. You have to. Come now. - Now? Yes. Okay! Are we gonna be completely marooned? I mean, no visitors at all? You didn't say anything to Betty? I didn't say anything to a soul, honest. Well, have a nice voyage to nowhere. I'll see you in a day or two. Don't get lost on the way home. Linda? Linda? Linda, are you there? What is it, Linda? Keep your voice down. - Come on. Quickly, this way! - What... what's happened? Shhh! Quietly. ...be able to stand all this shattering peace and quiet? - Oh my God! - Don't you worry about Nancy. I don't know what to do, I... - I think I'm going out of my mind! - Well, whatever's happened, Linda? Where's Henry? I don't know! He... He should have been home hours ago! I shouldn't get so excited, I expect he's been delayed at the clinic. Have you called him? Look. Come on, now. Come on, sit down. Come on. Just sit down, now. Sit down, and we'll just talk about it. - I don't want him to hear us. - Who? Oh, I'm scared. I am so scared. What are you talking about? I... I think he might have... I think he might have broken poor Henry's trains. - I don't think he likes Henry. - Who? Who has? Who doesn't? Oh... and Henry... Henry will be heartbroken and then he'll blame me. He'll say I did it! - Linda... - He came to the door, I... I mean, to the pool. And suddenly... he was just standing there. - Who was? - I had to let him in. - I had to. Had to. Had to. - Linda. That young man. Yesterday. At the hamburger place. - That Englishman. - What? Wait a minute. What have you been up to, Linda? Oh, now, come on. You ain't that scared. I had to. I had to. Had to. Had to. Linda? When you've kept something down inside you for so long, so very long it isn't easy to bring it all out in the open. I... I don't really know how to tell you. Even you, my best friend. Tell me what, Linda? On my fifteenth birthday... Go on. Go on. Well, we went to the travelling fair. My friends, my school friends, in the field outside the town. There was this guy on the bumper cars... I mean, he ran them, I suppose. Red cars, green cars, blue ones... Don't you just love the way the sparks fall down from the top of those poles? - With a crack, and a hiss, a phuzzzzt! - What? Ah, phuzzzzt! Electric! That's just the way he was. Electric! Bumper car man. The others, they got bored and drifted away. He wasn't interested in them, anyway. I was the prettiest. I always was the purty one. Yes, I was! But, Lindy, why are you telling me all this? I kind of hung around. Letting him come on to me. Wait a minute, now. - All the time. - You proposition me. - The distance, and... - You, instead of Nancy. the fairground music was... was churning... Now, your husband... Churning about. It was as if it was inside my stomach. - God. It made my legs go weak! - But he ain't never gonna forget it! This sounds like True Confessions, with a soundtrack. I'm sorry. I... I'm sorry. - ♪ When the red red robin comes... ♪ - What? The music. In the distance. Oh, that music! ♪ Comes bob-bob-bobbin' along ♪ Come on! No. I kept saying no! No! Don't! Don't! "Come on, baby!

For Christ's sakes, Linda, cut it out, you're scaring me! Jesus... He's gone. He's gone away. I knew he wouldn't stay. Who's gone? They always take him away from me. Who's gone? Go and look, Arlanda. Go look. Please. Please do this for me. Listen, Linda, I don't know what the hell's wrong with you, but what the fuck are you talking about? Please, please, please, Arlanda. Go and see if Henry's trains, I... I think I might have done something to them. - You? - Yes. Me. I... I think I might have smashed up his fucking trains. I tell you, this is giving me the creeps. I mean, I don't know what you're playing at. But, if it makes you happy... Hello, Arlanda. Did I scare you? Oh, Henry. Thank God you're here! What's the matter? It's Linda... Linda. - Oh, my God. - Linda... look at me. Look at me. - Poor ickle Henry. - Stop it! Please, Linda, stop it at once. Henry, what's wrong? What's happening to her? She's crazy. That's all. Totally loco. Henry! You have no idea. - You just don't know. - But, Henry... Do you think you could make her a hot drink? - Chocolate or something. - Why, yes, of course. Anything. Thank you. Poor thing. Hot drink, yes... Poor ickle Henry Henry. You bitch. You crazy boring idiot! Stop it! Do you hear me, stop it at once! Shut up! Shut up! Choo-choo. - What? - Choo! What do you mean? Are you referring to my trains? Chooga-chooga-chuff-chuff! Henry! Get off! I know what I'm doing. I know what I'm doing! They wouldn't even let me stay in school. After all, I am a doctor. They took him away from me. They... they pulled him out of me. And then they... they pulled him out of my arms. He didn't even cry or anything. He was only just born, you see. Yes, he did, he did cry. I heard him. Just once. They said God would punish me. My Daddy said, "Punish! Punish!" You haven't done anything to my trains, have you? - For Christ's sakes! - You're probably in on this with her. I know what you women are like. If there's one thing I've learnt in this world it's that women and trains don't mix. Listen, buster. You're the crazy one, going on about your toys like this! - Toys?! Toys? - I couldn't buy him any toys. Why shouldn't he play with yours, Henry? If you've... I'm going to go see if you... Oh, Linda. Linda, I just don't know what to do. I don't know how to help you. - Help me? - Well, if I could. - You want to help me? - Well, of course I do. The only way to help me now, Arlanda, is to remember. Remember everything you've seen and heard here tonight. Lock it in your head. Write it down. Well... what... why? - Linda, I... - Arlanda, please. Before Henry comes back down. - Yes, but... - Um, really, I know what to do now. Bye. Linda! Linda! Come here, I want to talk to you. No more clinics. No more drunks! Linda! Come here at once! Do you hear!? Well, I didn't do it. It wasn't me. I told you he'd come back to me. I always told you my baby would come back to me. Linda? Where are you? Here, Daddy... Linda? Linda? All aboard!
