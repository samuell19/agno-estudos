- There it goes! There it goes! It's over there! It's huge! - Come down here! Quick! We're getting closer! - Here comes the octopus of death! - Lucky shot! - Quick! - Throw the other hook! - We can't hoist it, it's too heavy! - Whatever. We'll cut it up while it's in the water. Tie it up! - Wow! That liver is huge! - We'll have three days' bait with this one. You, help him out! Grab it! - Hot damn. Hand me the machete! - I give it to you because you're my friend, but you'll have to pay for it. - Of course. I'll give you the money so you can carry out the monthly payments. Pigua! Take the cayuco and tie it to the stern. - You've bought it! - Good catch today? - You bet! The sharks came and came and Don Aurelio tried to catch what he could... We didn't even stop to eat, there were so many sharks. I even - - Shut up! Once you start talking, you never stop. I'll give you these in exchange for the cayuco and the nets. - I have enough of these. Look there. - I don't have anywhere to put the shark meat. Look. We caught about sixty last week. - Look at this tiny one. I'll cook it with some onion, tomato, habanero... - You make more elaborate dishes with these than even a woman does. - A woman's meat won't feed me. It's getting late and we're still having biscuits and coffee. - Alright, we're going. How does one say "goodbye, see you" in Korean, Don Pepe? I think he just insulted me. - Manela! Where are you, Manela? Over here! What's the matter? The cayuco! Don Aurelio bought the cayuco! He's got it! Hurry! It's over there! - Really? He's bought it? - Yes! A really good cayuco... ...and he's got the gear too! Nets, ropes... Hey! Among men, this is how things should be done. I speak freely here and everywhere. - As it should be. - If I help you work, you do the same for me. - That's fair. - I heard about the girl. Your daughter. I'm willing to teach them a trade where they can make a living. Whatever they need, right? Look, here they can fish just about anything. There are nets for sharks, for snooks, small fish... - Will you give them to us? - I'll give them to her. - Hold on, what do you mean? - You do the work, and you'll get your share. This is... a business... an investment. A commercial venture. - Alright... But what do we get out of it? - Hold on, Rosa. - I'm doing this for her. But, as I've said, this is a business matter, and I want my share. - The large one, I bet! - Look, for each... let's say for each 100 pesos made... ...she gets 25. Then 25 for each one of you... ...and 25 for me, for the investment I made. - They've got no children. I have a wife and a bunch of kids. No, this doesn't suit me. - Does getting drunk suit you better, huh? Waiting for some ship so you can work loading cargo? Have a little faith. This equipment will give you food for your kids... ...it'll get you in good health, get you clothes... - Don Aurelio speaks the truth, son. We are poor. We were never able to afford any of this. - The sky and the moon are enough for you, right? - Yes. - Well, there you go. Now... take care of what I give you. You come along. Now you see, I always keep my promises. I couldn't leave things the way they were. - You're right. - Although that doesn't really solve much. - Not really. - I don't even have money for myself. - Who gets it? - No one! - But I should give you some, right? - Well, if you w- Oh, now I've hurt myself here... - Today is not my day. A while ago, I - - Of course it's your day! It's a good day, the best! - Now you are somebody. You have your gear. Nobody will mess with you. - Yeah, just Rosa. She hits me. And she hits me because I let her, because if I... - She'll go easy on you now, because now they'll be living off of you. Well, off of what I... What's the matter? Don't you know that what I've given you is worth roughly 5000 pesos? And I'll have to pay for it with sleep and cigarettes. That's what I like... about the rest, I don't really care. - Oh, what can be done with you... Let me see your hair... Look... I'll build a shack where your dad's standing, so you can keep your salt and your nets... - For us both! - I want you to be independent. I don't want you to sleep among the others no more. Now, I'll tell you what I've told your father: Take care of what I've given you. And the best way of doing that is to take care of yourself. Hey! Come over here! Are you listening? You don't need to stumble around anymore... ...or mess around with anyone. - Me? When have I done such a thing? - You've done so twice. - No way! Only once. - And what about me? Am I made of plastic? - You... I like you. - And what about the other one? - Well, I was younger then, and he gave my a scented soap. I don't know why you're so funny. Pigua! Over here! Get over here! Here's $50 for Pigua. - Why don't you hold it for him? - I'm sick of being your money safe. - No, it's just that since I'm a little short on cash... ...I could be tempted to take some of it. But, no, that's the boy's money. - Oh, Aurelio. I've never seen anyone make such complex arrangements with money. Well, we did just fine today. ...but with all these lost days and the bad weather, I don't know how I'll make up for this month's payments. All this work and I've got no money... ...so I can buy a shirt or some decent shoes. - You're neck deep in water, yet you still want someone to pull your feet down... ...so you can drown. But of course, when someone catches your eye... - Ah, what are you talking about? The deal I made with the girl is strictly business. I get my own share, I can assure you that. If the fishing goes well, I can make 200 pesos a week. That way I can pay for the gear and still have some left for myself. - Eh, Aurelio, nice deal you've made, huh? What I'm not too sure about is the "fish". - I'm a vulture, man. And I don't really care if she's pretty or ugly. - Alright, let's have some fish tacos. - Hey! You were looking for me, so... here I am! - You earned 50 pesos. Don Raul is holding on to them for you. - But... we want to eat. - There's some fish over here! - But we don't want fish... we want to eat something else. - And... we want to go to the movies. - "We" is a lot of people, isn't it? - Just us. - Alright... here. But you wash the deck right now, understand? - Where's the bottle? - Right here, but it's empty... ...and I have no means of filling it up. - Don't worry, I'll give you some money to fill it up. - Yeah, hopefully you'll give something for once. - There goes Aurelio, fisherman of many fish. Be careful, you'll hurt yourself someday. - How are you doing, little brother? - Chilo! The great cook of the seas... ??? - What's been going on? How are things? - Very bad, Aurelio... I'm really poor... I swear. Won't you give me some dogfish sharks for me to sell? - Sorry, we only caught large sharks today. - Well, give me some change so I can eat, then. - There's some fish over here. - Stick it in your cellar! - You only want money to get drunk. - So what? Drinking is the only joy I have left. Aren't you going to give me for a drink? You were the one who left me one-eyed. - But I bought you a better eye. - Yes, prettier and sturdier. But I can't see out of it! Eh... I don't need to see, though. I've seen everything anyway. Alright, here you go. - We're done! Can we go now? - Yeah, get lost. - What do you want? - A can of sardines and a can of condensed milk. - Open it up well. - Just pierce this one. - Who is it? What? - It's me. - Get in. - I wrapped the coffee in this old skirt to keep it warm. It has plenty of sugar. - It's perfect. Really, I don't know how you do it. Pigua! Get out of here. - What will I get? - A kick in the you-know-where if you don't get lost. - Alright. You, follow me. - Did one of your kids get sick? - No, why? - Because you're sending more than the usual amount... - It's for books. They cost as if they were made out of gold. Here you go. $1800 and the post money. - This month's been a tough one. But as long as the sea doesn't dry up... See you. - Bye. I'm coming! Damn machine. - See? I told you there were more. - Hey! Leave that there. - Why? It's mine. - I need it to know what day it is. - Let go of it! Now you're going to tell us what to do, huh? You think we're your servants? Damn Korean! Tyrant! It's that damn blood of yours! - Son... Your mother's blood has been insulted. You have to feel pain somehow. - No, Roman, no! I swear I won't do it again! No! Please don't hurt me! - Stop it! Aurelio is here. - I'll leave this here. - Would you like some coffee? - I'm running late. I'll have some in the evening. Hurry up! It's late! - Yeah. - Let's go. Drop the ropes! - Hey, there's my compadre! - He's caught a large one! - Take us over there! - Hey! - How are you doing, compadre? - Hang on, I'm coming. Stop fooling around! You want to end up blind too? - Thanks, compadre. - Where had you been? I haven't seen you lately. - I've just been laying in my hammock, fighting malaria, eating quinine. - You should have told me. - What for? Those are memories left from my time in the jungle and the gum trees. You want half of this one? - If you won't need it. - The Americans say that thanks to the war... they've invented a very efficient medicine for malaria. - Yes, if you can afford it. - You haven't been so great, have you? - Not at all. - The sea is like a capricious old woman... ...she denies me everything. And she gives you a lot, enough to buy a girl. - What are you talking about? That is purely business. I get my own share out of it. - A very good deal, yes. If we had a boat engine, we wouldn't waste 3 hours a day killing ourselves with these oars. ...and with some new nets, I would have given you half of the fish. So if you really wanted a good business deal, you should have made it with me. - But there's some meat over there, Ruben. You're all skin and bones. Well, those are my thoughts. All that's left is the bone. Hit it, compadre. - Alright. - Harder! Come on! - Hold it steady! - Let's go, boys! Have a good one. You should come over sometime so you can see your goddaughter. - Of course! Thanks for the bait. - Let's go. - You have a good one, compadre. Good luck! - Have you sold it? - Huh? - My necklace! It's no longer here. - It should be somewhere over there. - Can I see it? - Again? - Soon I'll have someone come get it. Can't you give me a discount? - No. Eighty. - Could you put it over there so I can see it when I come by? - Alright. - Your compadre's not a good fisher. He's almost an anchovy. We just say hi, he gives us some bait... ...and we haven't caught anything since. - Anchovies! The kind that come in a can, the ones that make you so thirsty... ...that you end up drinking water until your belly swells up. - That's enough mocking him. - Me? What have I said? "Anchovies make you thirsty." That's all! - Have I offended anyone? - Is there no shutting you up? He's a good man. He's dying on his feet in order to help his family. He isn't doing so well... - How can he? He's from the inland. What does he know about the sea? - He's no worse fisherman than you. - He's wet behind the ears. He can't fish well. This guy here can do at least something, but your compadre can't fish or do anything. Am I speaking to myself here? - Come on. Let's prepare the quicklime. - Your coffee's boiled away. - Good. I won't lose my sleep now. - You know, my birthday's next month. - How old? - I'll have to ask my dad. I think I'm turning... eighteen. He told me I'd get that necklace. - Yeah? Tell him to wait a bit longer, just until some money comes our way. Speaking of that... ...let's get our cash sorted out. Hand over what you got this week. - That money too? I wanted to buy a dress. The one I'm wearing squeaks every time I put it on. - We have to pay for this first. I still owe around 1000 pesos for the house. Also... Bed: 80 pesos. Pan: 42 pesos, Matress: 30 pesos, Blanket: 18; bed sheet: 20; Pillow: 8 pesos, Stools, table, and... - Then what do I get from you? - From me? I'm giving you all I can, aren't I? What, don't you see all this? What about the cayuco and the nets-? - You haven't even paid for it yet. - I found out that you haven't really paid for anything yet. With your weekly share... ...you're able to pay for it all and still have some left over. So, what does it matter? And you're taking my share as well. Well, take it! - You're wrong, darling. When have I cheated you? You know that send my children everything I earn. For me, that's something... sacred, OK? But I have my word... ...which is worth as much as gold to the people around here. And I use it so you can earn something. Because if I leave someday... ...or something happens... ...you won't go into poverty. Who else would have done that? Now hand me that money... ...but do so nicely. - Are you leaving? Spend the night here, won't you? - I can't. Let's go, Chilo! - So, will you buy me that necklace? That way I can have something from you... ...an actual gift. Could I have it for my birthday? - Well... alright. - Why don't you stay with her? You enjoy her, get some rest and I'll pick you up tomorrow. Are you mad? They get used to it, then they treat you as their husband... ...they start nagging... nah. I don't need another wife. - Pull it up. Three got away. You can see the holes in the nets. - Bad luck. - Yeah. Bad luck is when it happens once. It's happened plenty of times already. - No, Roman, don't push it. - Come here. - Calm down! - Come here. - I don't want to. See? You've scared the baby. Manela! - What is it? - Can you hold her for a bit so she stops crying? - I'm preparing quicklime. - I'll help you prepare it later. Is that alright? - Well, let's see if she quiets down. - Rosa! - What is it? - She doesn't want to be with me. - Oh, just leave her over there. - In the state capital, all those buses pass you by like... ...zoom, zoom! - There comes Aurelio, our good friend. - Where are you going? - What's up? - Hey Aurelio! Come have a drink with us! It's on me. - Not right now, I'll join you later. - What? Have you retired from the small vices? - No, but if I accept your drink I'll have to buy you one as well. I don't have money for that right now. - Where's your eye? - What, the eye that goes over here? - Well, I left it at a friend's. - Yeah, sure... let me see it! - No, see, I gave it to him so I wouldn't lose it - - How much? - No, he said-no, look- - How much?! - Well, three pesos. - Here, buy it back. Damn drunkard. - Thinks he's a big shot, huh? Since he's the boss' protege... - What protege? He's- - What do you care, you bastard? - Here you go. Give back my eye. - Is something wrong? - No. I got a letter from my family. I was thinking of them just now... Look. - Oh, they look great. Pedrito looks like a grown man now. What's worrying you? - Nothing, it's just that... ...my wife... she says she's very sad... ...and that my kids miss me. Here, listen. Tell me this isn't enough to make one feel sad... "You have to start thinking about coming to Mexico City. Think about it, Aurelio. If you won't do it for me, do it for your children. They haven't seen you in over three years. The youngest two almost don't know you." There's my problem. - Look, mommy! There's my godfather. Leave him be. He's done nothing for you. - These are very difficult choices. When you have some spare time, drop by my office... ...we can talk about this then. - ...I learnt yesterday. It was a prank for Aurelio. - These are loose, aren't they? - I bought 'em for you. You tell me. - Why is Don Aurelio like that? Why is he upset? - He's angry... angry as a cat. - He won't let us be. "Didn't you see..." and "get lost" and "go back"... ...and he stabs the sharks so forcefully that it's scary. - Look. Look at this. - Stick 'em in well, let's see what happens then. - I put sticks on both ends already, and so have they. - Well, I don't know. I've used them to fish just ahead of you and nothing's gone wrong. - Why do they always elude us? Why?! - What are you doing here? - You didn't come by, so... - I'm in a very bad mood. Worried, too. - You should have dropped by, 'cause... ...you can forget your troubles there. Well... I can make you forget them. Can't I? - Yes, woman. If it weren't for you... - Going somewhere? Can I come along? - No, it could be dangerous. - Oh, you're no fun. - Yeah, I know. But this is a man's task. - Alright. You'd better go home now. - Are you going that way? You can drop me off. - Ok. - What's playing? Is it an action film? - Yes, action. - Where do they get so much money from? - Who knows? - Do you see anything? - No. I hope I'm wrong. I'm so tired. - Why don't you relax and get some shut eye? I can keep watch. I have really good eyesight. I can even see in the dark. - I love your hair. It feels like feathers. It smells so nice... like the sea. - Like fish? - No. Like the sea breeze. Like the palm trees. - Don't fall overboard. The sharks are very mean over here. - Get some sleep. I can keep an eye out from here. Look! The cayuco! - Bastard... - Won't he drown due to the blow? - No, he won't... ...he's hiding beneath the surface, the damn bastard. I'll find out who you are, and I'll tear you apart, you thief! - Are you going to leave him? - I want to get him... ...but he won't show himself! He's probably swimming to shore now. - Have you heard, Aurelio? - Yes. Did you find him? - Yes, he was on his last breath when I saw the cayuco and- - No! Please don't hurt him, we had nothing to eat... ...he was so desperate. No, please! No! - Out of my way, comadre. - Don't hurt him! - Get out, comadre! - Aurelio, he's sick! Forgive him, Aurelio, he's your compadre! - He has the right to beat him. - Compadre... - Roman! You too; go get the doctor. - Forgive me, compadre. - It's my fault. - Let's forget about all this, shall we? We have to keep looking forward. When you get better, we'll find some way to make this all work. - Pretty strong, huh? You know I only want to help you out. Trust me. Keep this boat. - Yes, but how? Yesterday I sent a lot of money to my family; then there's Chilo, Pigua, the whole deal... ...now look what's left. - Don Aurelio! This wheel is too high up for me. We'll have to get a stool... ...'cause I can't see a thing. - Look, I'll make you an offer: I'll give you the boat for the $60 you paid... ...and you can pay for the rest later with your fish. - No, 80 thousand pesos is too expensive for me. Also, this boat needs a larger crew. Chero, Segundo, I'll have to pay them some... ...Chilo, and my other duties... Oh, and my compadre, who hasn't paid a bit since I beat him. - He's a scoundrel, with all that funny business - - Alright, shut up! - Think it over, Aurelio. Think it over. Look, come over here... The boat's as good as this one, but I'm giving it to you for half the price. - Don't be stupid. If you fish a lot of shrimp, within a year you'll be doing great. - Shrimp! Shrimp... Shrimp are tiny things... ...I'm a shark hunter. - He's the best there is! Shooting harpoons at the manta ray... ...and pulling in the sharks. - Shut up, kid. Get lost! Stop bothering us. - So what will it be? Don't you want to have it? - No, I've got enough things to worry about as it is. - Alright. As you wish! But don't you ever ask me for a favor again. - Of course, Don Raul. I won't ask. But could you lend my compadre a boat? Just to get him off my back. - Alright, send him over tomorrow. Shark hunter... ha! - What's up, Domingo! How's it going? Hey. It smells great. I don't know how you do it, having the coffee always ready. - I always have water boiling. And when I hear the boat engine, I add the coffee. - Why do you buy this crap, if you can't even read? - I can see, though. - Don't you like the cover girl? - Of course. But you don't see women like these around here. Oh, now I see one. A bit ugly and dark-skinned, but here she is. Look at that! Cigarretes... ...a nice cup... Thanks. - A good coffee deserves a nice cup. - How nice of you. - No, if I could - If you didn't take all of my money, I would give you some nice presents. - Hey, what have you got there? - Nothing. Just my stuff. - Your stuff? What stuff? - You crazy... get them off! One can't be serious around you. - My birthday is on Thursday. Will you remember? - Funny girl. I think she can smell me. - Well, are you staying or not? - Well... alright. It's her birthday. Come get me in the morning. - What have you done? - I wanted a necklace... ...and now I have one. It's all mine! - Let's go, Chilo! - Hello? Hello! Can you hear me? - Yes! I can now! - Did you hear everything I said? - Yes! But I'll have to think it over! - You won't ever find a deal like this one. You must be here in two weeks, so you can... - Hello? Hello! - He's gone again. - The communication is pretty bad. - Aurelio! - It's your wife! - Adela! How is everyone doing? - Fine. You're coming, right? Please, Aurelio, I beg you! - It's hard right now. Everything has been so sudden... - You must do it, Aurelio! You must! - Dad! - Pedrito! - Son! How great it is to hear you! - Same! You're coming, aren't you? We miss you so much, dad! We need you here with us. Will you come? - Yes, son. Yes, I'll come. - What? - I'll come! - So, you've made up your mind... - What can I do? They need me so much... Besides, I'm being offered me a good business deal. - Yes, you've been thinking about doing this for a while now. - I have to do it. When I spoke to my boys, I felt a knot in my stomach. Funny, huh? People talk about feeling heartache, but I felt it in my stomach. ??? When they're small, their mother takes care of them. Now they need me. Youths today are going astray. They need their father, advice... ...respect, all those things. Education... - And do you think you'll be happy there? - Well... yes, I do. I'm getting sick of the sea, the sharks, and doing the same thing every day. Maybe I'm getting old... ...or I'll be getting old soon. That's when you start needing your own family to look after you. ??? And many times, I have to take food out of my own mouth... ...so I can send them some more. When I get there, no matter what job I do... ...I'll have something for myself. - No, you're absolutely right. So you can earn something... ...I'll make you our representative for our canned fish in Mexico City. - Thanks, Don Raul. Now I only need you to figure out what can I do with the boat. - No problem. I lent you the boat in order to help you... ...but our company is always in need of a boat like that... ...so I'll buy it from you, and that's that. - To tell the truth, Don Raul, you've been a friend like no other. Get out of here, you! - Damn Mateo, you bully. - Shut up! Get going! How's it going, fellas? What's up? Get lost, or I'll kick you out! - Ha, ha, ha! Very funny, you, fighting with orphans. They have nothing and yet you pick on them. You damn drunk! - Well done, man. That's how real men fight. One against three. - Against four... ...if you're up for it. - Why not? But using this. C'mon, get yours out. That way we'll be even. - This isn't worth dying for - - Of course it is. What were you expecting? Three, four blows... ...then we get pulled apart and have some drinks? No... I'll have none of that. - Alright, Aurelio. I'll back out, since I don't want to fight over this. But one day I'll be right... ...and I'll have you then, Aurelio. I'll have you! - Well, on that day I'll back out. - Well, since you gave me a knot in my throat... ...buy me a drink so it'll go away. - Aurelio! Catch this! They stole it from you. - We didn't steal it! - We just borrowed it. We wanted to go to the movies, but you weren't there... - It was dumb, I know. - I don't care about you... ...but you, Pigua, is this all you have to say? - Well, yes, and... we're really sorry. It'll grow back soon. - The boat is going to look great. Just like that time we painted it. It looked better when it was darker. - Go get Don Aurelio. - Yeah, sure I will. Right away. He must think very highly of us, after we stole his wool mesh Hey, you, fatso! Why are you painting that green? Don Aurelio prefers black. - But it's no longer his boat... ...and if you call me fatso again, I'll break your jaw. - What, he doesn't own the boat anymore? - No, he sold it. - Ah, you're drunk! - No, go ask him. Here I come! - The water is great. Stay still, I'll bathe you as if you were a kid. - Manela! Manela! - Over here! - What's the matter? Did you see the devil? - Come over here! - Who, me? No, you come here. - Come, please! - Don Aurelio... ...is it true you're going to Mexico City? - Yes, it's true. - Don't cry, or I'll hurt you. Why didn't you tell me? - What difference would it have made? - Actually... none. - Pigua, go to the town. We'll talk later. I had to do this, Manela... ...although it pains me. I'm making a sacrifice... - You don't have to apologize. It's not a big deal. - Apologize to you? I'd have to apologize to my wife first. - Yes, you should do that. You have cheated on her too. - "Too"? When have I cheated you? I never once told you that I loved you, and you never told me that, either. It was a... business deal between both of us. - You struck the deal... ...I never said a thing. - I gave you an income for your sustenance... ...and you've made me happy. But my children, they need me. I must go to them. - And so you'll just leave me here. - No! I'm leaving you... in better conditions. - Can't you think of any harsher words to speak? - Forgive me... I didn't mean to hurt you... ...I don't know why - - It doesn't matter. You have a nice trip. In a coffin. - Manela! - Look, from a man to another man, I tell you... ...I've traveled quite a bit. And I've been to... - Every single jail in Mexico. - But not because I'm a thief like you are. I'm a star. - You one-eyed fool! What do you know about the jungle? What do you know about the fevers and snakes? What do you know about the foreman's whip? Look! So what? I've been to Houston and Broadway... - I'm finished, compadre. I'm finished! This will be my last goodbye... ...because I will die soon. I said I will die soon! - But this time make it true! Because then you're just burying friends... - Oh, little brother... what will we do without you? The sharks will eat us up! I'll buy you a drink. You, go get them. I'm paying. What, you? You're poor! - Pretty girls and I, we pay with just one look. - No, hey, there's no need... - What, am I not worth enough to buy you a drink? Am I just trash, just fish guts? Come on, don't refuse it. - Alright. - We'll miss you a lot, Aurelio! - Especially you. You're so bad, no one else will hire you now. I'll find some other fool. - Hey, Aurelio, come here. Since you're leaving, let me have the girl. - Ah, you little bastard. Now you want another fight you'll back out of. - Hey, what's this? Just two? - Come on, give 'em your good eye too. - Sure, didn't you say you'd drink my marble? - Cheers, brother. May you be merry... ...even though we won't see you around. - Cheers. - ...where could she have gone to? - I don't know. We haven't seen her since yesterday. - Manela! Manela! Manela! Manela! It's no use. Let's go. Give my share to Tomas, until all the gear is paid for... ...split it after that's been done. Half for you... ...half for Manela. - Thank you, Don Aurelio. - You've been a blessing. - Well, so this is goodbye. Best of luck... ...and raise these kids well. - Godspeed, Don Aurelio. Say hello to Adela for me... ...if she still remembers me. - All I ask is... take good care of Manela. She's a good girl... ...now she'll be sad and lonely. Treat her well, Rosa. And if someone comes near her... ...make sure he's a decent man... ...a man with good intentions. - Don't worry, Aurelio. - Pigua, come here. I've been worried about you. For your own future. Don Raul, a good friend of mine, will give you a job. He's got 1000 pesos that belong to you, and with what you'll earn... ...you'll be able to afford your own fishing gear when you're older. - Aren't you coming back? - Of course I will. I'll drop by to see you and... - But we'll never go shark hunting together again, or harpoon manta rays... - Yes we will, when I come back - - When you come back! You're not the same man. - Hey, Pigua... - Hey, Pedro, wait! - Here, take this. - No Aurelio, I don't - - Take it. 1000 pesos so you can get on your feet. - But I... - Take it! Hey, wait up! - Goodbye, compadre. Write me a letter sometime. - I never got to fight you, Aurelio. - Tomas... - Good luck, little brother. Don't let the inland storms sink you down. - Pigua, have you seen Manela? - Hey, kid... - Don't touch me, you bastard! Go to your rotten family! - Pigua! How dare you talk to me that way! - I hope you and your wife and your children all die! I'll smash your head in if you get any closer. - You coming or staying, Aurelio? - Coming! - Quit throwing rocks, kid. - Let go of me! - Calm down! - Good luck, little brother! - Goodbye, compadre! - Manela! Manela! Go to the other dock! Please, Manela! I need to speak to you! Manela! Get over there! Manela! Manela! Manela! - Aurelio! Oh, son! My Aurelio! Oh, what joy! Adela! Adela, Aurelio's here! - No, Ma, I can't, I'm full. - Why, I made it for you! Just a little, alright? - What's up, captain? Where's your mind sailing to? - Oh, it's just that... I can't believe I'm here. - Give my brother-in-law another tequila so he can cheer up a bit. - Put on some music! Let's turn this party up! - He's a sound, hardworking man. He's even talked about marrying her. - Hey, dad... ...has Rodolfo told you about the business? - A bit. I haven't had a chance to speak to him yet. - We've been running the numbers and we're certain that... ...we'll double our money in less than a year. - Wow, I didn't think you'd be so grown up. I'll gladly talk it over with you. Look, tomorrow morning - - Make it in the evening; I've classes all day. - Alright, whenever you can. - Would you like some coffee, son? Do you like it strong? - Yes. - My God, what a bed. After all these years sleeping fully clothed over some wood planks... ...this is like floating in warm water. - Poor Aurelio. All those sacrifices you've made for us. I felt bad about it every night. But that's all over now. Do you... - Do you see me older now? - No. If anything, you've put on a little weight. Your hair is so smooth... ...it smells really nice. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Why? - I don't know. You seem so sad... - I'm getting older. That may be it. - Yet, I... ...by your side right now I feel... ...as if I... ...oh, Aurelio! My Aurelio! - Shh, it's alright. - How's the sound? - Huh? - How's the sound? - The engine's? Good. Even and steady. - I told you! This is the best one of all three. That's why I put ten thousand pesos towards it. - Wow. - The business is so good... ...that there were plenty of people interested in it. I could have done it... ...even if you had backed out. It's better to die than to live a miserable life, right? All that shark hunting is over. In two years we'll have the best automobile business in Mexico. - ...and when you go out with him you better get home early. You shouldn't be out late at night; people will start spreading rumors. - "Late"? I always get home before eight. - Don't yell, you'll wake dad up. He isn't feeling well. - I'm sick of being told what to do. - I do it because - - Quiet! - Hey, what's going on? Why are you arguing? - It's him. It's as if he swallowed Hitler. I put up with you because Dad wasn't here. But I won't anymore. - Alright... ...could someone tell me wh- - It's just useless bickering. They love each other, though. Come on, give your brother a kiss. - Idiot. There. - Is your stomach feeling better? - Yes, a bit. Have you got some bicarbonate? - Mmhmm. Let's see. Algebra... Physics... Tri-go-no-me-t... wow! You'll be a scientist, won't you? - No. But if I ever become someone important, it'll be because of you, Dad. - Nah, come on. It'll be because you're worth it. - True. There aren't many children like ours. It's the truth. These times are full of stuck up girls and rebel boys... Studying at home. They've never upset me. - Good, good. Are they always so quiet? -Mmhmm. - Don't you think they might be sick? - They're just very well educated. And they never interrupt people's conversations. - What's the matter? - I don't know. It's funny. I remembered... ah. "They never interrupt people's conversations..." - Dad's very strange, isn't he? - Hi, Ma. Have Adela and the kids arrived yet? - Why are you so sad, Aurelio? Aren't you glad you're here with us? - It's just that the change has been... Oh, I've nothing to do and I feel like a ghost. - You'll get used to your new surroundings and start working. - More like watch other people work for me. - Yes, that's why you're the boss. - The boss... Here the boss is anyone who pays the employees... ...but back there it was a title you got because of your experience and knowledge. "Fishing boss"... that was something. - But a fisherman nonetheless. Here you can earn more money, you can get to be somebody. - I'd be just another businessman. When I die, they'll remember me as "Rodolfo's partner". Back there I'm Aurelio, the best shark hunter there is. - You have to understand. - I do understand you, son... ...but not everyone can do what he wants do do for a living. We have to deal with where God puts us. You owe yourself to your family, and you must make sacrifices for them. - Then, am I not worth anything? - No. You've lived your life already. - Me? - Yes. You did so however you wanted, but you've lived it. Now you should only worry about your children's future. - Then... we'll have to say goodbye to him. - Look! Sixty thousand pesos! - Wow! - That's what he made off selling the boat. - I didn't think that piece of junk was worth that much. - Eh? "Piece of junk", my shark-hunting boat? It had a superb engine. And it was great at handling the tide. We got that money because of it. - Well, thanks for the money, Dad. I'll pay for my wedding and furniture. - What wedding? You're too young to be thinking about weddings - - I'm not that young. I'm eighteen already. - Eighteen? - Yes. You'd best start practicing your grandfather face. - Here. Don't lose it. - Are you going to deliver it now? I'll walk with you to the bus stop. - Can we go too, Mommy? - Yes, dear. Koreans? Like this? From Korea? - Well, these were already from Tabasco, but their grandparents came from Korea. They're good, hardworking people. - You might think he's very calm, but he's a natural leader. - Imagine a boat captain... Hey, Aurelio, tell them how you managed the crew. Like this! - Life by the sea must be interesting. - It's a lot of work, but it's nice. - And a lover at each harbor, as the song goes. - No, that isn't us. Those are the merchants. - Don't be shy, I won't tell my wife. Besides, here people have at least one lover. - Am I right? - Even a third one. - Don't tell me you were a saint. - No, of course, I'm a man... - ...and there must be some fine women along the shore. - How many dozens do you have? - Me? No. - Well, there's this girl that... - Pretty, right? - I wouldn't - well, yes. She had a... how can I put this... ...she could make you sad and then happy. She was unpredictable. She was kind, brave... She wasn't shy, I can tell you that. She was a fierce one. If something upset her, she'd toss around and bite... ...just like a shark. - Oh, Aurelio... - I think you fell deeply in love there. - Me? Fall in love? You're crazy. Not even for her. It was a business deal. Purely business. But love? - Here are the contracts. - Thanks. - Do you want to check the corrections? - I don't mean to appear distrustful, but I do. Right. Right. Aurelio, hand me the check. - The check... I seem to have forgotten it. - But you promised to - - I'm sorry. I've forgotten it. I don't know how it happened. I'll bring it tomorrow and we'll sign the contract. Anyway... ...if it's one day late, it doesn't really matter. - Pedro! - What are you doing here, Dad? - Waiting for you. I need to talk to you, son, about some important things. I know you'll understand me because, even though you're young... ...you're more educated and, frankly, smarter than I am. - Don't say that, Dad. - It's the truth. I admire you greatly. Sometimes I even think I should call you Dad. Don't go that far. - I'm leaving, son. - You're leaving? Where to? - Over there. To where I belong. Listen carefully and try to understand. Over here I... I just don't feel like myself. I don't get along that well with people here. I don't know why. I don't see myself in this business which I care nothing about. I feel old, Pedrito. Tired. Exhausted. In two years I'll be useless. - But why? You're still young and strong. - Yes, but... I feel old on the inside, you get me? And over here... ...how can I put it... ...everything's comfortable. Bed, food... ...the people are so well-behaved, as it should be. I would end up getting too comfortable. Over there we're all tough, rough as sharks. I'm a shark hunter. - I understand, Dad, but... ...how can you just leave like this? Forever? - Not forever. I'll come around to see you every once in a while. I'll be able to. Look... ...here's the money from the business. Give all of it to Rodolfo... ...and have him put under your name. - But what about you? What will you do with no boat? - "No boat"? I still have my word. And I'll get my boat back, since it pays for itself. I promise you, son, that everything I'll earn I'll send it to all of you. - It's not that, Dad... ...it's just that we need you here with us. - What for? Your sister will get married soon. You can take care of the rest. You've been the man of the house. - But... what about Ma? - Some other time I come around, when you're a bit older... ...and you've suffered and you've learned a thing or two about women... ...we'll talk, one man to another. - Hey, Tomas! Tomas! Aurelio has arrived. - Where? - Over there on the other side. He'll take a bit but he's here. - Tomas, the boss is here! Don Aurelio is here! Here comes my boss! Don Aurelio is here! Here comes the other raft! Don Aurelio is here... he's on the other side of the river. The boss is here! He's coming back to us! Don Aurelio is coming! Don Aurelio is here! Don Aurelio is here! He's coming! Chilo! Chilo! Chilo! Chilo! Don Aurelio is here! He's coming! - You're crazy, what do you mean he's coming? - I'm telling you, it's true! Here comes the other raft! - I'm sorry, fella, but you're out of a partner. - Aurelio is coming! - Aurelio? How do you know? - I don't know, but they say that the raft is coming. Run! - Let's go see. - Tomas! Hey, Tomas! - What's up? - Hey, is it true that Aurelio has come? - Yes, come along, let's go get him. - Let's go! - Manela! Manela! Manela! - What's the matter? What's happening? - Don Aurelio! Don Aurelio, he's here! Don Aurelio! Over there! Run! Didn't you hear me? Don Aurelio is here, he's come back to us! Come on, hurry! Where are you going? Are you crazy? - Ah, my land! - I've come back, you bastards! This film has been made by workers of the Film Production Worker's Sydicate of Mexico.
