I'm going to finish mine way before yours pal. Yeah? Well mine will be the one that doesn't need fixing again next week. Off screen: You got to find some reason Dude. Yes! No. What? Bellport Herald. Seriously? You just hang up. Yes! I want to know about Earl's pacing, and Helen is just sitting there. You know, I'm not one to pry into anyobody's business. Really? Selma Franklin told me that Helen is planning to go live with her son and daughter in law in Minnesota. Retiring? Who will write the Viola column? Who knows? But me? I am never going to retire. I mean, I know print papers are a dying breed, but they're going to have to carry me out of here in a pine box. But, everybody loves her advice! We love that everybody has problems. Amen to that, but Earl Haig's change. Look around! No Helen, no Viola. And no Herald. Okay. I'm not going to beat around the bush. As you can see, our beloved Helen is leaving us. And as much as I would love to continue running her column, we can't. Nobody else writes Dear Viola like Helen, so until I can break the news of her departure to our readers, and, heaven help me, the syndicates, if anyone, Bryan, brings the word of this to anyone, Peggy, you are fired. Good luck with that! Good luck Helen. Good luck Bellport. This town is going to go ballistic without her column. Dear Viola, I am writing to you because I don't know how to get along with my neighbour... He has always stayed to himself, until he built a fence that has crossed over onto my property. I don't want to cause any trouble, but what should I do? Should I leave it alone? On the Fence. To get full? Uh, Good morning Mr. Berchard Dear On the Fence, Get off of the fence. It's not your fence, even if it is on your property... Time for you to put your foot down, draw your property lines, and get a new survey done. I hate to say this, but people take advantage of people who don't push back. Even good neighbours. So, push back, even if you fall off that darn fence! Don't even try to hide that man Hide what? How long have we known each other? Too long. Fifteen years? I know that you read that studid advice column. This? Listen, why don't you just go down the street and get a pedicure while you're at it. When's your wife back from her mother's? 24 days, 9 hours, and 3 minutes. Yeah, and you're pathetic. I'm pathetic? Good, we all agree. Dear Viola, I seen to be on edge all the time. I'm snapping at my husband, at my kids. It's not like me! I feel like I'm coming un-glued. I'm scared and mad, and I don't know why. I don't want to be around any of them, or around anyone for that matter, including myself. Please help me, Wits End. Dear Wits End, We're all at our wits end truth be told all the time. We're just good at distracting ourselves. The world and everything in it bombards us on a daily basis. Even the people we love piss us off, we're human. I'm going to give you some advice that you've heard a million times before from Cosmo to Oprah. So you might think that I'm just being lazy or taking short cuts, but I assure you, I am doing neither. I repeat and regurgitate anything from any source that works, so, here it is. Take five minutes in the morning for yourself, whether you close your eyes, and pray, meditate, walk, knit, doesn't matter. Five minutes every morning before the onslaught. And here it comes, you are no good to anyone else, unless you are good to yourself. Brian: Okay, so your bingo night is particularly news-worthy because? Really? you're giving away a rubbarb pie as the grand prize. Hold on! Who put this on my desk? Okay, not mind readers! What is it? It's a Dear Viola column. Maybe it's her swan song? No, no , no! this wasn't Helen. She never wrote like this. This has spunk, attitude, you know? Well, whoever wrote this gets a raise, a promotion, the column. The whole ship and match. All right, I wrote it. Anybody else. Alright, whoever you are, I can't figure out why you won't come forward, but trust me, I will find you. Renny? Hi baby! I'm in the kitchen. What did we say about the cooking? Don't remember. And you can't use your age or your dementia as a defense. Did you take your pills? Yes. And I do remember, I'm not a child. I know you're not Renny, you took care of mom for ten years now it's my turn. Here, you sit and read your paper. I will finish dinner. I can't wait to see what poor soul Viola's put straight today. You can't tell. It's a secret but Viola's retiring. What? No! Not having Viola's column to look forward to everyday is going to make poeple in this town, including me, go crazy, or should I say crazier. I know! It's too bad Earl doesn't want to replace her. Well I don't know how you can replace Viola. (Doorbell rings) Since you won't let me do anything else around here, the least I can do is open the door, and pretend I'm the maid. Oh, come on in! How you doing? I'm good, thank you. Yourself? Good, come on through. Something smells good. Well, what a nice surprise Katie! Inviting Earl for dinner. Oh no no. I just popped by to chat a little business with Katie. If it's a bad time I could come back. Oh no, that's fine.I'll just leave you two alone. Alright. Nice seeing you! You too. You know, it's funny, I completely forgot that we have one of those security cameras in the office. I thought it broke a couple of years ago, but then Jake told me he fixed the darn thing. Handy fella, that Jake. Any who, it occured to me that whoever dropped that Dear Viola letter on my desk would probably be on camera. And what do you know? There you were Katie. Plain as day. Why didn't you just come forward? Because, all my life, I wanted to be a writer, and then my life just went Kaplooey. Mom couldn't bake anymore, and you know, I couldn't keep the bakery going without her. The book keeping just took over. And writing is hard. I mean to tell you the truth, I was shocked when you said it was good I didn't step forward because I don't know if I can do it again. Write another one. Katie, you're insightful, honest. Even funny. I had no idea you were any of those things. Neither did I! Where did it come from? I don't know! The words just came out! Maybe it's easier being Viola than me. Whichever, I'm offering you, Katie, the job. Okay. I'll take the job. Good. With a few conditions. One, I can keep my job as a book keeper. Two, I remain annonymous. No one knows it's me. The column can still just be good old Dear Viola. Agreed. There you are. Get started. Oh my goodness! You still insist on snail mail? If somebody takes the time to lick a stamp and an envelope, they usually have something important to say. So, I expect two columns on my desk first thing in the morning. I got a hunch you're going to help me keep a roof over my kids' heads. Viola. Oh! You can't tell anyone! And you can't forget that you can't tell anyone. Okay? Whoo! Look at this! Don't you cry! This one has little flowers on it. Look at all this! So many people need our help! Dear Viola. Dear Viola, I've tried to grow tomatos in half shade for a year now to little success. Dear Viola, I know that I'm only twenty two, but it seems like I'm stuck in this town with my parents' dreams for me, and I think I need more. I don't want to upset or disrespect them, but I do want to live my own life. Dear Viola, I hate my sister. She's a fat hunk of junk. Dear Viola, I feel strange being a grown man and writing to an advice column, but I have to get this out somehow. My wife was the most beautiful, loving person I have ever met; my soul mate. I know people say we have more than one, but to me that's a lot of hooey. She could find joy in the smallest things. She loved music, she loved to dance, which I never did do well. And she loved all of me, even my short comings. I lost her five years ago, and on that day I lost my faith in God, and humanity. Everything reminds me of her. Especially my daughter, because she is so like her. I'm scared I'm falling off the cliff. I hope you can help me, Lost Love. Dear Lost Love, let me try to understand this. You lost your wife, which is aweful and I'm truly sorry about that, but you still have a child who loves and needs you, and is very much alive and well. It sounds to me like you're punishing her for being a part of your one great love. Is that right? Go Viola! You say you've lost your way. You only have one way, and that's to be a father to your daughter. Don't forget, you had a great love, you were lucky! Do you know how many people never do? So unless you're seriously depressed, and in that case, your time is better spent seeing a therapist instead of writing to me, it's time for you to take a risk and start living again. If not for you, than for your late wife, who would want you to stop whining and be a father to your daughter. Alright now! Viola is on fire. Hey, did you read the new Viola? I don't know whether you noticed or not, but I don't have time for leisure activities. I just wonder how Earl found a new Viola so fast. I thought she was done but, this new Viola, she is fierce! Did you read the reality check she gave Lost Love? Like I said, some of us have jobs. Thank God flipping articles from decorating magazines is so vital to the Herald's success. What can I say? It's a talent. Okay, here. (Car beeping) Bye! See you tomorrow. Hey Dad! Hey Muffin How was tutoring? Ok. Yeah? Come here. Did you pick up the paper today? I did, why? Cause Mrs. Applebee passed it to Mrs. Gritsbe, and they were sneak reading it today during science class. She was supposed to be listening to our reports on hydroponic vegetables. So it was passed around all day. Really? Wow. There's something... Look here it is Don't you have more important things to do like, oh, I don't know... homework? You're no fun! I am fun. No! I mean who's going to play zero gravity with you later, huh? Ummm, you That's right. Cause I'm fun. Because you're awesome. Ok grab your things, let's get washed up for dinner. No fun! So who do we think "Lost Love" is? A single guy with a kid... Wife died 5 years ago... You really think he's telling the truth? I bet he made all that up, just to throw us off his trail. Thanks. See ya! I bet he's divorced, no kids, maybe he's a she. You are evil. It's just like a soap! No, this is way better. Ok first of all, it's real, and this new Viola, whoever she is, she is out to shake us all up. A new Viola? There's somebody new writing her column? I just though someone spiked her tea. No. No. I don't mean new, new... I'm just saying that writing to Lost Love is bringing out a new side of her. They were all trying to figure out who Lost Love is, but I'm dying to know about this new Viola. Well, with working that extra day styling the bridal party, your paycheque's looking pretty good! Here you go! Don't go spending it all in one place. Thanks Katie, you're good people. You know, all you do is work and take care of Renny Jasper. You never go out or socialize. Why don't you come to the rope loft with us on Satruday, great DJ and man do we kick up our heels. I'm not much of a dancer Lost Love says he can't dance either. What is it with you people! You do know who Lost Love is, don't you? Is she the one writing letters to Viola? Please, lost love is a man, through and through. Check him out. ( Music ) Dear Viola, while I appreciate the fact that you answered my letter, I have to tell you that you are way out of line. I am worthy of great love, and unless you have a kid, I'd really prefer it if you didn't suggest that I'm a bad father. I'm out here, trying to do my very best every day, so tough love? Not really helpful. Dear Lost Love. Tough love? Really? I don't think so. Good morning. Good morning Russ. I told you I was sorry about your wife and belive me, I understand loss. But if you want me to pick up a violin and play with you, It's not going to happen. I have no doubt you're a good father. Maybe even a good man. But the whoa is me? Not so attractive. Russ you alright? Sounds like you need to hit your live life again button. Take a risk and love again. You have nothing to lose, because you've lost everything already. Dear Viola, Sounds like you're calling me a coward. Do you have any idea what's it's like to have lost a loved one? And if you do, you tell me the proper amount of time to mourn. Daddy? Yeah? What are you writing? A letter. To grandma? Yeah. I love writing letters to grandma. I guess it's easy for you to sit behind a computer and tell other people how to live their lives. How great is yours? Do you even have a life? Or do you just write about other people and judge them? Here's a challenge. Anonymity is easy, and you've done it for years. So how about you come forward now, and show your face. If you have the guts for that, I guess I'll have to step up and take a risk too. Lost Love really put it to you this time! To Viola, you mean. Oh I don't know. Seems to me like there's a lot of the Katie I know in Miss Viola Now he's giving back as good as he gets. You gonna take him up on it? I have to answers other letters too, you know. Who's the coward now? Dear Lost Love, yes, I do have a life, but this is not about me, and I am not here to judge yours, or anyone else's for that matter. I want to be the gentle push, or the hard shove for people to move on and forward. But dispite my best efforts, you seem to be quite stubborn. Yet you continue writing me letters. Why? I think, as angry as it makes you, you do want my advice, and just so you know Whatever you say, I'm not going to give up on you. Enjoy your fish, it's beautiful! Thank you so much. Have a great day. So... I hope you don't give up on yourself either. Until next time, Viola. Katie, here are those spreadsheets you were asking about. So Katie, are you beefing up on your skillset over there? Peggy, why don't you just mind your own business? Really, coming from you, that's rich. Dear Viola, I hate to say it, or agree with you, but I guess I can be stubborn on occasion. You're right, I havent moved forward, and it's time to stop writing about it. Hey Katie are you in there? Did you hear that reading on the throne can sometimes give you... (toilet flushing) You know, I know sneaky. You don't wear it very well. I'm sorry, I've got to get these deposites to the bank. You're up to something, I wasn't born yesterday. I wasn't even born last week. Even though the reason I keep writing you is because I feel so much, not because I feel so little. And just so you know Viola, I do want to love again. I guess I just haven't met the right person. Time for your pills. Isn't that just beautiful? The way you two keep writing eachother, you'd think you were falling in love. Renny. I like the guy. He's a bit corny. Not be Jesus corny... but if he uses words like "hooey", he reminds me of you. That's ridiculous. Well, why are his letters the only ones that you've answered? Lots of other folks are clamoring for Viola to write to them. Isn't that what you said? Management will take it under advisement. Mmmhm. (Church choir singing) While I draw in, pleading breath. When mine eyes shall close in death When I'm sure, two worlds are known See beyond, thy judgement throw Rock of ages, Cleft for me Let me hide myself in thee Maybe he's Lost Love. Well who do you think it is? Oh, man with the glasses, he has a little girl. So does he. Neither of them. Maybe he's not even from Bellport. Maybe it's Earl! It could be Peggy, it would be just like her to stir things up. Or Craig. His wife did leave 5 years ago, the timeline fits. Lead us in the double gour Safe from ruth and make me gour Good morning Slow down munchkin, you're going to loose a finger How's it going? Fine. Good, keeping busy? Usual. Accounting, baking. You? Yeah, just trying to keep up with this one. I do feed her, this isn't breakfast or anyhting. Just make sure you save one for someone else, okay? Say thank you. Thank you You're welcome Meredith. See ya Katie Oh um... For the road. Oh! Thanks Dear Lost Love, I'm glad you haven't given up on love or on yourself. Love is an extrodinary thing. Yes you're right about me... I might not have a PhD in love, but, I know one thing. Our fears and insecurieties are what derail us. Hello Katharine Katie's fine. Katie, then. Do you want something Craig? I uhh, I just wanted to know how you were finding services at the bank. Fine. Great, great. I like to see our customers happy. Terrific then. Playing it safe, not stepping into the unknown, things will remain exactly the same. It's no way to really live. Maybe it's easier for you to write than actually do something, but I'll leave you with this: There is pain in staying the same, and there is pain in changing. Pick the one that moves you forward. You're pathetic dude! Thank you. No, I'm serious. Look, I know loosing Emily knocked you out, but you've been in a slump for a long time, and I don't know what to do to bring you out of it. So enough's enough. Tonight we're going to the Rope Loft, you're going to get drunk, we're going to play pool, and you're going to flirt with some girls. Now I'm an old married dude, so I'm going to have to sell my aux djskdjfh thing through you. So step it up. Fine. Okay? Okay fine. Alright. I told you Russ, tonight is your night. Alexis Kan? Nooo. totally not her type. No she would not even give me the time of day in highschool. I'd say hello to her and then she would walk by as if I wasn- Hi Russ Alexis! I don't dance. Well, then. Maybe you can take me out for dinner. I already ate. Full. Not tonight, silly. How about Friday? Okay, yeah. Yeah Firday it is. He said he did it... He's taking me out! Hey Bryan Hey Katie Good morning Katie Oh, hi uh... Russ Are you okay? You don't look so good. Oh, thanks. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way. I hear you were painting the town red last night! Yeah... Does this place have to be so small. Apparently it does. I think it's kind of comforting, everybody looking out for each other. Bah, it's a bunch of hooey, it's annoying. What did you say? It's annoying No, not that Come on Katie, you know you can't do a thing in this town without everybody knowing about it. Hooey. Hmm? You said hooey. Yeah, I said it. It's a bunch of hooey. Dinner was delicious, thanks. I'm glad you enjoyed it. So, do you want to come back for a nightcap? Uh I'd love to, but I can't, I've got the kid at home. Hello... look at me. Oh Alexis it's not you... You know what Russ, you've got the whole package. Looks, charm, but you got no game. Renny do you want the mint or the chamomile? (plates crash) Renny? Stay still, just stay still okay? I'm calling 911. No no no do no such thing, I'm fine. Let me help you. What happened? I should know better than to be reading while I'm trying to walk up stairs, that's all. Are you dizzy, lightheaded? No no no. I'm not having a stroke. You know I had one. And I know what it feels like. Okay. And I need you to stop worrying about me and start thinking about yourself! I will take that under advisement. Don't patronize me Ms. Know It All. I'm not. Just because you're a big time writer now, it don't mean you can talk to me any way you want. I knew you in I know, and I'm not a bit time writer now, this is Bellport not Shrinkport. Yeah yeah yeah. Well you know it's funny, that I had to come from there, take care of your momma... and now I'm the one being taken care of. We're taking care of eachother. Yeah... well you gave up your dreams of graduate school to take care of every other person in this town including me. Oh fooey, I gave up nothing. This is what I chose. And I worry about you. Stop your worrying about me. I ain't going nowhere. until I make sure that you are going to be okay. You're my baby. And also, until we find out who Mr. Lost Love is. Now I'm going to bed. I know who he is. Who? I can't tell you. Confidentiality. Well whoever he is, I'm going to figure it out, and I don't need your help. If you do know, and he's going to be in church on Sunday, you better step up your game. Here. Okay, okay. Sunday, it's on. (Choir singing) I have found a friend Oh, such a friend He bled, he died to save me And not alone, the gift of life But his own self he gave me I know. I saw that twinkle in your eyes when you looked at him. Mmmhm. Hey, it's my biggest fan. Okay, I have to ask. Is there any way that you can show us how to make these. If I show you, I'm going to have to kill you. Why? Oh! No no, I'm just kidding! It's really not that hard. How about after dinner tomorrow? No. Oh. When are you free? Friday Done. Yes. We'll see you. Dun dun dun! Well Katie, look at you getting your nails done. Got big plans for tonight? No, no I just figured it was time. Oh, it's time. After we do your nails, let's see what we can do with your hair. Well, I like to keep it simple, nothing too fancy shmancy. Fancy shmancy? Girl you need to relax and let me hook you up. Okay. But just the nails, alright? Okay. It's about time, I was about to send for search and rescue. Sorry I just stopped off to pick up a few things. From Bella Boutique? What do you think? What, you don't like it? Honey, your momma didn't look good in floral, but she insisted on them just like you. Well I thought it was pretty, it's bright and summery. He just invited me over to bake cupcakes. Baby, I hate to put it to you like this, but back in the day before they built express ways, you'd be on an interstate road driving along, and there'd be this big old sign that said "Last Chance for Gas" You know what that meant? It would be miles and miles before you got another chance if you didn't stop and fill up. Any way to keep your anaolgies to yourself? Nope And there ain't nothing wrong with a little come and get it, Just not in a floral pattern! Just saying. Hi Hi. What's wrong? Nothing's wrong! Come on! Thought you'd have the wrong address, huh? I was having my doubts. You look nice! Thanks. My mom used to have flowers on her dresses too! Thanks. You do look nice. Your nails are different too. Okay Meredith, why don't we let Katie settle in. Before we disect her. Let's go make some cupcakes. Let's go make some cupcakes. This way! Okay So our big project last night was getting together everything on your list. Except the apron. See, you pick! Oh, they're all so beautiful,I can't decide. My mom made them. Heh. She must have been quite a seamstress. She could do anything! She must have been quite a seamstress. Well, there are lots of things I can't do, but I can make cupcakes. I used to make them with my mom. Hers were the best, even better than mine. Oh, no disrespect to your mom, but I can't imagine her cupcakes being... Uh.... more delicious than yours. So, what do we do first? First, I'm going to need a sous-chef and an assistant. Who wants to be what? I'll be a sous-chef! I guess I'm your assistant. Now as long as it doesn't involve any measuring because I am all thumbs. Don't worry, you'll be just fine. Smack it, there you go! Nice. Ok this one goes is, get ready for the next one. Why have I been making breakfast all this time? You should be making it. Take the shell out. Nice, nice, nice!

Sorry to hear... that your best friend... intentionally left you off of her... wedding... Just cut to the chase. What did she say to Lost Love? She didn't seem to write him this time. Or maybe he didn't write her because Lost Love found a girl. Hello Hello. Come on, let's help her out Hey, how are you? I don't know why I have so many bags No problem, me and my buddy here can take your bags from the dock to your door, and visitors like you qualify for a discount.

It's a great little town Dear "Feeling fabulous at Fourty", it's great to hear that your cosmetic procedures are healing, and in the spirit of healing, you may want to ask yourself why you felt the need to change anyhting about yourself in the first place I've gotta tell you Katie, subscriptions are way up since you started writing this column. I don't know what else to attribute it to. Thanks Earl, but I think the town's just a little bored, in general. No. It's you. It's your writing. Yeah. The way you put things strikes a chord with people. I hear good things from the other papers too. Subscriptions are up there and they love the column more than ever. Look I know I'm just the editor, but uh... Why hasn't Viola written back to Lost Love lately, hm? Well, I kind of thought we needed a little more variety. Dear Viola should be an equal opportunity Know-It-All, and she was being a bit biased. Alright, fair enough, but I think everyone's really hooked on your letters with this guy. I mean we're all waiting for him to write back in and tell you that he's found true love Everybody wants a happy ending Well he hasn't written in about that yet Well just promise me that when he does... you'll print that one, huh? Sure. No problem, Earl. Alright. Greetings! I'll be right with you. Oh no rush, I'm just getting my sea legs here. A visitor! Are you staying with us a while? Permanently I hope, if I can find a job. Then you've come to the right place. We do more than hair and nails here, whatever's broke- No, nothing's wrong exactly... but I would love to change my line of work. I was a nanny over on Swirl Island. Oh and the little feet wore you out? No I just want to shake things up a bit, you know? I'm Jaimie Estavis I'm Cindy, this is Katie. Hi.

How many kids does he have? Just one, an 8 year old daughter. What kinds of things do they like to do? I don't know them that well, but they like to cook Last year he won the Bellport BBQ title, it was cute... I think his daughter made the sauce Katie, Hey! Hi Russ It's nice to see you, what's going on? Did I get the time wrong? Oh, I guess I'm a little early. I tend to do that, I'm sorry. I don't like to keep people waiting. Waiting for what?

I love a good steak, especially if it's done on the grill Do you barbecue Russ? As a matter of fact, I do. And I'm pretty good. The secret is in the sauce. It's got to be the right balance of hot and tangy Well I do have some help on that end, my daughter Meredith is my partner. Your daughter? Yeah. Lucky you I was a nanny once for 2 little girls I miss them so much 8 years old going on 80 So smart, sometimes I think she's the parent and I'm the kid Well, I would love to meet her one day I would like that. (laughing from hallway) She may be in bed by now Hey Katie, is Meredith down for the night? Sorry, you just missed her! Oh shoot. Russ just told me so much about her, I just wanted to stop off and meet her Well, so meet Katie instead. Katie, this is Jaimie I know Katie, we met at the salon. Oh. Nice seeing you.

Hi Katie Oh, the service is still top notch! Great, great. I was thinking that maybe we should have a drink sometime, or something? I'm really not that interesting. Neither am I, we might be perfect together I think we should both aim higher, then. But thank you, for asking ( music ) Meredith, lunch is ready Coming Guess what What? We have company Meredith, this is my friend Jaimie Jaimie, this is my beautiful daughter Meredith Hi Meredith, I'm so happy to meet you, your dad has told me so much about you He doesn't talk about anyhting else, do you honey?

Yeah Just not feeling so good Is it because of Jaimie, because there's another person around? I don't know I want my dad to be happy but... she's not very nice to me Do you want me to talk to your dad? No, I'm sure thing will get better. ( music ) Dear Viola, first of all, let me say thank you. You've made me less scared, you've pushed me, made me see that I have to try to move on Because of that, I've met a beautiful girl and started dating her, but I'm a little concerned, I think my daughter doesn't like her Maybe it's a kid thing, or she's a bit jealous of anyone that takes me away from her. I don't know. Should I stop seeing her, and wait first for the person that is right for my daughter, and then for me? Lost Love. ( music ) Dear Lost Love, give it a little time, maybe they will both warm up to eachother. Children heal at a much slower rate than they appear to. Did Lost Love write in? Did he write? Did she stick it to him? We just have to not rush to our default setting and jump into judgement Everyone deserves a second chance Amen sister, amen How's Alecia's father doing Clay? Better, get's out of the hospital tomorrow. Thank goodness, she'll be home soon then. Oh yeah, 3 days, 23 hours and 18 minutes Yes, 18 minutes How's business? Been working my butt off Russ is really busy these days. Excuse me. Now what do we need to do to get this girl hitched? Find the right guy? What about that nice bank manager? Craig? Uhh yeah yeah I think he's a nice guy. You hear that Kaite? What if you found the right guy, but he's taken? You mean the right guy like Russ? Look, what are you doing Saturday night? Nothing, why? Look Russ and I are celebrating our partnership being 15 years old, so why don't you be my date. I'm not looking forward to being a third wheel anyway So Katie, strut your stuff, huh? C'mon you can outclass that Jaimie girl no problem Mhmm I don't think so Look. You gotta fight back If you want something in this world then you've gotta go for t My father used to tell me, that when people say that they never got a chance, it's because they never took a chance Amen. (instrumental music) Your eyes are going to set my head on fire I know how you feel about Russ And you say that he's not feeling it back, and it won't make a difference what Clay has up his sleeve Now honey, I think you should at least try going out with Craig Sometimes true love doesn't find us. Sometimes a good man is good enough! I don't want good enough. I don't want to settle You may have to You didn't. And how well did that turn out? I thought you liked being single? And independant. Not my whole blessed life! I'm telling you. It's good to have someone. I do. And don't you use me as an excuse. I'm not ( music ) (church bell) Wow, the world must be ending if you're late. Zip it. Hey, what is going on? It doesn't matter Of course it matters I have no life! I never will I like a guy who doesn't like me Russ? How did you know? I know everything Clay's wife is out of town, and he wants me to go as his date on Saturday with Jaimie and Russ so I can "outclass" her Strut my stuff. Stand out like a sore thumb. Katie. You are fantasitc, okay And and anyone would be lucky to have somebody as loyal and loving and smart as you are The feeling is mututal Okay. We are going to spend saturday together and make over whatever doubts that you have You wouldn't belive by the time I'm done, because if you can do it, we all can. ( music ) Yep. I love it.

Uh yeah, it was her idea. Are we taking your boat out? Yes dinner included, and on the menu is the catch of the day One second Here she is, all dolled up for her fiftenth anniversary Boy, I'm really not dressed for this. Do we have to go out there? Oh it's going to be a great night I get kind of seasick You've never mentioned it before It just never came up So we keep it tied up The boat looks beautiful, and I'm sure the food will be perfect This is where Russ and I first met Just got to town with too many bags and he rushed to my rescue Right Russ?

I had a great time tonight And the food was amazing Hey it was out pleasure Thank you, Clay It was worth a shot Hey Katie, don't give up. Okay, shall we? You're home already?

I'm happy for him. No you're not. You can lie to yourself, but not to me It just doesn't seem like him. Jaimie's so transparent, I mean she's gorgeous, but... she's not for him Listen, for all their bravato, god bless 'em, are little boys.

And they're easily distracted Sometimes we have to set them straight You should have seen what she was wearing I mean she's so sexy, and I'm so- You're so beautiful Just beautiful You and Clay think I should push myself between them But I can't. I want Russ to want me. To see me. Really see me I don't think he can see past all that blonde. And those butterfly eyelashes Good morning sleepy head Hi dad Were you home late last night?
