That's good. What does he want this time? That we find his phone. Someone stole it. A special, extra secure, very expensive phone. Go, Gilou... It's work. I know. Come on. You alright? I'm tired. We'll sleep well here. Can't wait to get there. I know. What's with her? On TV, they say it's the end of the world. That's why you're crying? Yes. You're scared? Yes. Me too, I'm scared. It's normal to be scared. Everyone gets scared. Don't you think it's the end of the world? Look. It's beautiful. You know how many stars there are just above our heads? No. About 2600. In addition, there are 300 billion that we can't even see. And yet, there they are. Just above our heads. And all that in our little galaxy. Galaxies, we don't even know how many there are. Maybe 500 billion. Maybe more. In each of those, there are more stars than we can see. All this can't just disappear. That's not possible. What's you're name? Jesus. You're the real Jesus? And you two, what are your names? Willy... And Esther. And Willy. Esther and Willy. That's beautiful. That goes well together, Esther and Willy. No, I'm older than you, I'm two months older. No. Think about it, I was born in December, you were born in January. December, is just before January. I was born early December, you, late January, I'm two months older. -'64? -Yes. -The same year? -Yes. -Ben, I was born before you. -No. If, I was born in January of the year that you were born in December. I'm ten months older than you. I always thought I was older. -What difference does it make? -That I'm younger than you. It's better for you. No, I look older. -No. -Oh yes. I look older. Man, this dog is annoying! Can you call your dog? Why would I do that? He's getting on our nerves. They come here and act big. Jesus is gone! You cold? -Yes. Got a signal. Let her go! Damn. I bet you it's up there. I'm not going through the woods on foot. And I'm not going up there to chase after a phone. We don't even know if it's up there. You have a better idea? No. What's wrong, Gilou? Nothing. What's going on, Gilou? Nothing. I didn't sleep well. I'm a little tired. It's okay. Why doesn't he turn his phone on? Fine, done for today. There's no one. When I called to book it, someone answered the phone. Good evening. Sorry, I'm not very fast, anymore. I live just past the garden. Here are the keys. Breakfast is served from 7:30 a.m. Should we do the paperwork tomorrow? There's no rush. Good, it's cold. Goodnight. You see, there was someone. We can't go like this. We need a gift. Like what? I don't know. How old is she? I don't know. You don't know how old she is? No. Older than 10? I think so. Older than 15? -I don't know. -It's no big deal. No big deal. We'll get her a gift for all ages. Like what? I don't know... I'll find something. -You promise? -Of course. What was that? There's something. Come on! You don't look so good. I'm okay. Cooking two eggs isn't very complicated. Is that what's bothering you? -What? -Eggs? We're the only customers, it's a bit long. If he's too old for this, he should stop. Thank you. Look... Esther... I'll go find a gift. You stay here. -I'm coming with you. -No! Remember the hotel? They almost got us. They can get you too. No. Have you seen how fast I run? You shouldn't be scared. -You don't know the way. -Yeah, it's straight ahead. When I get there, I turn around and come straight back. I'll be quick. Samuel Detry. He would be 38. Then why does he look like this? He's been mummified. -Are you joking? -No. How long has he been there? At least a year. Maybe 2 or 3. 2 years and nobody noticed. So it seems. How did he turn into a mummy? They store grain here. The air is very dry. Let's get out of here. Don't want anyone to see us here. Gilou! Gilou, damn! Hi. What you got there in your pocket? Hey, where are you going? Stay three! Stop! Come here! Careful! Listen to me, idiot! It's closed everywhere around here. There's nowhere to hide. I'll wait for you to come out of your hiding place. There's cameras everywhere! As soon as you come out, I unleash the dogs and shoot you like a rabbit! It's me. I think I've found the thief who attacked your wife at the hotel. Call me back. My partner has a minor health problem. I'm just telling you as a precaution. It shouldn't be long before we get our hands on it. He turned off the phone and so we can't find him. That proves that he still has it. This'll be settled in 2 or 3 days. I know. But with this health problem, it will take another 2 or 3 days. You friend isn't here? The fat one with his little dog. -The fat one? -Yeah, the fat one. He wouldn't like to hear that. Fat people never like being called fat. In my class at school, there was a fat one like your friend. We called him Slug. He was all sticky, without a neck, he was always sweating. One day, someone told us that slugs melt if you put salt on their dick. So, we tried it with Slug. But, since fat guys have little dicks, we had trouble finding it. Would you shut up? You want me to shut up? This is my home. You don't make the rules, around here. I'll finish my story, if I want to. We took Slug and we tied his dick... Need any help? With what? To start the car, of course. Yeah, okay. Hold this for me. Go! You gotta release the handbrake. The heart does not like being worried about. -You're saying that for me? -Yes. How do you know that I'm worried? You're always staring at the monitor. And how do you know that I'm staring at it? I know it. I don't know how, but I know it. Can you understand that? No. Me neither. You got heart problems, too? No. I've been shot. -Shot? -Yup. -Is it serious? -In the hand. That's unusual. Your wife shot you? I'm not married. Are you? No. Kids? No. Who worries about you? I don't know. My friends, I suppose. And you? Who do you worry about? Aside from you? Esther? Esther... I screwed up, sorry. You spent the whole night in there? So it seems. Some coffee to warm you up. Which means... They're waiting for me, I don't have much time. You're going to scare them with this head. I live 5 minutes from here. You're not from here. No. It's for a job. A job? Here? -Hello. -Hello. -Your daughter? -Yes. I see the resemblance. I hope not. Camille... He's the one who helped me out last night. I didn't get a chance to thank you. Indeed. That's done. You should have called me right away. I did. Why didn't you leave a message? I did leave one. I never got it. I left a message. What did he look like? Small, thin, short hair. He was wearing neon clothes. Like a construction worker? Yeah, like road workers. -But, really dirty. -It's funny. I met the female. Where? Look, it came from the hotel. He's the one who attacked your wife. What should we do? We grab the little prick. What? Wait until you see what you've got. No, it's nothing. I think it is. They don't have to tell me. Why not? I know what I have. How do you know? You've had it for a long time? A little while. But lately, the attacks are getting worse. What do they say about it? It's progressive They don't know any more. How serious is it? Why didn't you say anything? It messes up my life. I do not wanna talk about it. Should've told me. -What difference does it make? -Still, you should've told me. At least to me! Then I would have understood why you're in such a bad mood. -I was going to tell you. -When? When, if you weren't in the hospital. You don't look so great, either. It was cold last night and I had to sleep in the back. -Of the pick-up? -Yeah. -And Gibus? -What about him? -Where'd he sleep? -In the pick-up. -Locked in? -Yeah. He spent the whole night in the pick-up? He was inside and I was outside, so he wasn't alone. I didn't sleep. I'll go, alone. If there's trouble, call the old man. I came to see if everything's alright. I'm fine, thanks. -Nothing you need? -No. I can walk the dog. I can still walk. Good. If you need anything... It's dangerous to walk round with a gun. It'll only get you into trouble. It's dangerous for you. And for Oher people. So, give it to me. No. -Give it. -No. -I need it. -What for? To protect Esther. Do you see what you've done? You shot me. I came to the shelter and you shot me. I though it was an animal. -Did you call the police? -No. Give it to me before you kill someone. And then, you'll go to jail. Where'd you get that? I found it in a hotel room. With the phone. I'm not a thief. We're hungry, it's to protect Esther. I keep getting lost, which is why I took it with me. It's got GPS. But I don't know how to use it. Give it here. We need to find Esther. Yes, she's no longer here. She's gone. Let's go. But first, you have to eat. Wait for me here. Understood? Mister... Mister! I'm sorry I acted like that. I'm having a bit of a hard time. I'm not comfortable with it. I was rude. You said that if I needed something. I need something, but it's quite special. Willy? I'm trying. I do what I can. I need to sit down. My knees hurt.. I found someone for you. Okay. Thanks. He's almost as old as me. I'm scared that if we wait too long... We'll do it tomorrow.. I'd like to know something. The plants in the greenhouse... Yes? You take care of them all by yourself? Yes. That must be a lot of work. What exactly do you want to know? Why bother with all of it? The hotel, the plants, the breakfast... You're not that fit anymore. Because living... is more than just breathing. Cochise... There's something outside. What is that? He's been hit. A bullet in the side and he walked over here. Must finish it. He suffering. Has to be done. Or he'll be in agony for hours. I don't have a weapon. He's been well preserved. It's almost a shame to bury him. We still have to do it. We have to be very careful. Is it working? What is it? Contrary to what you believe, you're still on your feet. This is less the case with us. So it is up to you to take on the physical task of this process. Looks like you're attacking my friends. What are you gonna do about it, sheriff? Lynch me? Get out of the car. Hands in the air. Search him, just in case. Come on. What is that? It's okay, it's nothing. Take this. What themes should I address in prayer? I don't know. Do your best. No, it's up to you to tell us. It would be nice to say that... for him... dying alone must not have been very pleasant. But now it's done, he's not still all alone. What was his name? Samuel. Samuel... May your journey be pleasant, much more pleasant than your life was. Forgive those who didn't know how to look at you, know how to listen to or love you. The love that you could have given on earth, give it from where you are. Give it in thought. Give it in thought for people, for us. Think of us who are still here, the time we have left to live, the time to join you, you and the others, all our brothers, soon reunited. Soon. Here is what the First and the Last said: "I was dead and I have returned to life." Amen. Gibus! What are you doing there? Okay. Are you hurt? Do you speak French? Okay. Okay. You like dogs? Go on. You know what we're gonna do? We can't stay here long, it's way too cold and we'll get sick. And I have my two... grandfathers waiting for me. I'm going to come to you, I'm going to help you get up and I'm going to carry you. Okay? There he is. So? Where are they, your accomplices? We know you're not alone. There was a woman with you Where is she? Talk or we'll report you to the cops for theft and assault. Or for attempted rape! Do you know what they do in the shower with rapists in prison? You don't know? Is that what you want? He's completely burnt. That's no excuse. We're going to take him to the police. No way. They'll just release him, right away. We settle this ourselves. We're going to find that girl of his. We'll teach them not to fuck with us. Hello. Yes? Do you sell duct tape and clamps? We don't sell to private individuals. This is a wholesaler. Hey! Not to private individuals. Goodbye. Damn it, it's a day for brain cramps. Oh! Be careful with that toy. Do you want to shoot us while wearing mittens? Duct tape and clamps, please. A little car trouble? What do you actually do for work? It's hard to explain. Above all, do not explain. No, she won't talk. She hasn't said anything. I don't even know her name. It was weird because... I carried her to the car, I put it on the hood, and there... she didn't want to let go of me. She wanted to stay attached to me. It felt really crazy. It was as if... something happened to me. I can't explain it. Crazy, isn't it? How do you feel? Strangely enough, I feel quite good. You look better. Oh yeah? Why don't you take it off? You can't wash with all your clothes on. Take your jacket off. I was a gift from Willy. I'll be careful with it. You'll get it back when you're done. Look... We'll put it there, so you can see it. Is that okay? Well done. Who's Willy? My fiance. He's not with you? -He went to get a present. -Oh? For whom? For my daughter. What's her name? Cynthia. That's beautiful. Who old is she? Where are you going with Willy? To see Cynthia. Where is she? Tell me, Esther. What do you want me to tell? Tell me why you're sad. You can say it quietly. Before Willy, I had a fiance. We had a daughter. But I am a bit disabled, so she went to a foster home. I wasn't allowed to see her. Willy said the world's gonna end. That's what I think, too. I told Willy, I wanted to see her before it happened. We asked the director of the foster home, but he said we couldn't see her. He said it's up to the judge. The judge decides where my daughter lives. So then Willy and I left. We're going to the judge to get the address. But Willy said that no one can know, or the cops will get us. So, that's why we've been hiding. I just want to see her before the world ends. I'm a bit disabled, but it's not my fault. Okay. But first, we need to get you cleaned up. And Willy? I understand why he wants to get his phone back. It sucks. Especially for him. What are you gonna do? I wanted to get your opinion. Fuck him. Before, we'd have returned the phone and gotten paid. Yeah, but we've changed. It's me. So? We found the phone. - Good. At least, we know where it is. We also saw what was on it. You look good. Really good. -What do you want? -Us, nothing. But the others want some money or it's going on YouTube. There are a lot of them and they're armed. We're too old for that. To find the phone, follow the signal with your shit software. Us, we're done. What are you talking about? We have a contract. Don't disappoint me. Move your ass or we'll make you an internet superstar. Perfect. Her name is Esther. And there's another one named Willy. We need to find him as soon as possible. What the fuck! You, stay here! You, come with me! -You're hurt. -I don't care! Get that mitten wearing motherfucker! I have to leave you here. -I have to go on alone. -Where? I don't really know. Then why do you have to go? I just have to. I have a lot to do and I've lost a lot of time. And Esther? -What do I do? -Continue straight ahead. Keep going and don't come back. Is that all? Yes. Are you the real Jesus? Yes. Look. Did you see? Isn't it beautiful? I did that? Only this one. Straight ahead and don't turn around. Straight ahead. Don't stop, just keep going. Willy... Esther! It's closed. The phone. What phone? The phone. Want to make a phone call? It's closed. Nice of you to lend us your car. It's a piece of junk that keeps breaking down. Bring her back or sell her and send me the money. But never come here again. Go on. Get out of here. Tell me, Cochise, what exactly are we doing? We're looking for a judge and little Cynthia, I think. Is that true? Yes.
