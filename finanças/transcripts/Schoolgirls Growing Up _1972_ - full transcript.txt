SCHOOLGIRL REPORT 3: WHAT PARENTS FIND UNTHINKABLE Based on the book by G?nther Hunold With an epilogue by Kurt Seelmann Former Director, City Youth Office of Munich starring many anonymous youths and parents And as reporter: Written by Music by Photography Design Editor and Assistant Director Executive producer Producer Directed by The NEW Schoolgirl Report 2 Ladies and gentlemen, you'll probably recognize me... ...if you're one of the 10 million viewers... ...who watched the first two episodes of Schoolgirl Report. You may well ask, ''What else could they tell us in a third part?'' As you will see, the facts are new and even more shocking. Please judge for yourselves. We'll strike while the iron's hot. The Christian Young Men's Association in Hamburg... ...has published a guide on sex education. It's an article meant to educate young students on healthy sexuality. How does it work in practice? Nine boys and six girls. Seven, we got another girl. I hope it's all right. Six or seven, it doesn't matter. How old? - Between 15 and 18. - Oh, my! Those brats sometimes require a heavy hand. But we can't do that anymore. Youth group leaders don't have the same authority today. I don't care. But in here, everything must be in order. ''Sexuality is a vital force against death. This force is not biology, but love.'' - What kind of rubbish is this? - It's not rubbish. It's a guide on sexuality for youth groups... ...published by the Men's Christian Youth Association. - Rubbish. - Makes me want to vomit. Listen. ''Recognizing the procreative importance of sexuality... ...sex is conducive to life. This is why sexuality must be given its place in our association.'' Bravo! Now listen up, guys. ''Because of this new approach, and at the request of our youth... ...mutual masturbation... ...skinny-dipping... ...and shared sleeping quarters are now acceptable.'' Here it is, sweetie, in black and white. - I can't believe it. - Hard to believe, eh? Did you read it too? - What is mutual masturbation? - Filth. You'd like that, wouldn't you? - Wouldn't you? - Why else would I ask you? I didn't know we were so progressive. Where can we go skinny-dipping around here? 200 meters to the left, then 50 meters down that way. Well, with or without? According to the guide, without is allowed. Full of big words, but then you chicken out. - Well, you go first. - I will. - Do it then. - Bah! I'm all for the new way. Me too. - Well, pants off. - No problem. You'll have to take them off yourself. What's wrong with you? stop pulling, Blackie. Good afternoon, madam. Good afternoon. You pig. I wasn't this naked even on my wedding night. Come on. Let's go. What's this? Is it ''Butt Naked Day'' today? Yeah, mine were that beautiful once too... ...long, long ago. Well, knock me over. Group sex. Oh, boy. Don't look, Blackie. We're being corrupted. No shared sleeping quarters, I see. Everything must be in order. I think the boys are up to something tonight. - No way. - Yeah, pretending to be ghosts. They're so childish. - You want something else, eh? - After the swim, I feel great. - How about we haunt them? - Great idea. Here comes Dracula! Quiet. I want my peace. Keep that nonsense out of here. The beds are all empty. - What about me? - Where are the others? They're with the other girls. - What crap. - That didn't work out. I'm Knight Kunibert, nasty and dead for 700 years. You're pretty lively for a dead guy. I feed on the blood of young girls. - Someone's coming. - Let's go. - Get out! - What's up? Too late. Go hide. Lights out. See, Mr. Balzer? Everything's okay. In here, everything must be in order. - Go to sleep, then. - Good night. - Help me up. - I'm coming. You're a heavy bag. We can start now. - Hurry, let's go. - You crazy? You can't leave now. I'll warm up with Alex. But don't bite. Your feet are cold. - And who'll kiss me? - Shut up. Fool around a bit. A real weathervane. When the regional association put the guide into practice... ...it was kicked out of the Christian federation. The guide had been written by adults... ...and the ban was issued by adults. But can adults give sexual advice to young people... ...regardless of whether they're experts or benevolent laymen? They were stupid for getting caught. They certainly didn't plan on that. Do you think that boys and girls spending their holidays in a camp... ...should be allowed to have sex? My goodness. Whether you're for or against it, they'll do it regardless. Sure, that's why you spend your holidays together. If I knew the boy. Why not? We did the same in our day. Based on my age, I would be against it. Mr. Balzer had no choice. If he allowed us to fuck, he'd be in trouble. Regulations and laws, I can't stand it. It's so outdated. If two people really like each other... ...they'll find a way to fuck. - Is that experience talking? - You got a problem with that? My intimacy is no one else's business. I don't know. As a girl, you can find yourself in situations... ...that you can't get out of by yourself. I experienced it myself, not so long ago. The German Romantic writers must be seen in terms of their time. They are a striking example- - I have a headache. May I be excused? - Yes. A striking example that the output of an artist- If only I hadn't had such a splitting headache that day... ...it would never have happened. Get her. If she screams, cover her mouth. Okay, but I get a turn after you. Are you crazy? Get out of here. You know any reason why we should? Because this is the ladies' room. Get undressed and show me how much of a lady you are. You're pigs. Where are you from? We have a free period. And we're looking for a productive activity. Then let's get started with this productive activity. - Come on, give me a kiss. - You're out of your mind. Come on. Her legs. Come on. Calm down. - Come on. - Yeah. What you're witnessing is not the invention of a screenwriter. It is reality. It's the consequence of a youthful urge to show off. As a result, the rape of a schoolgirl is seen as a heroic act... ...an abominably heroic act. Come on, hold her tight. Now me. All right, go for it. Come on. What the hell is going on here? Thank God. Mr. Pfeifer, Mr. Pfeifer! These three raped me. You don't say? - What do you say to that? - Rape, that's bullshit. - We always meet this slut here. - Sure. Absolutely. You rotten liars. I'm calling the police. I wouldn't do that, girl. You heard what they said. Go back to class. Not a word about this, or you'll be expelled. That goes for all of you, understand? You come see me at 4:00 this afternoon, then we'll see. Now get lost, but be quiet. They tricked me. What can I do? The janitor doesn't believe me. No one will believe me. Grossmann, you're not listening. You still have a headache? Well, then I'll spare you for now. Where were we? I had forgotten my headache. I hope the janitor will keep his mouth shut. It's up to you, Edith, whether I keep quiet or not. - What should I do? - First, keep quiet. No one will believe you when those three contradict you. - But you believe me. - I believe what I can see. I don't want you to get expelled only because- Because what? Well, if it goes public, I'll be in trouble. You- - What do you want? Money? - No, not money. - What? - Don't act stupid. You're experienced. You're a madman. How can I save you? If you make a mistake now, your whole life will be ruined. I'm obligated to tell the principal, and you know what happens then. All right. Where? Here, on this dirty couch? Don't cry, girl. Take off your clothes. - Everything? - Lose the skirt. Besides, the couch isn't that dirty. Happy? For starters. Who is he? This is Mr. Dreier, civil servant. - How old is she? - Fourteen. So that was it. It was all a dirty game. The three boys had raped me on the janitor's orders. And he just wanted to pass me on. I had fallen into this trap. And now I'm lost. It happened exactly as you see it here. A schoolgirl, still a child... ...is transformed into the coveted sex object of small town dignitaries. As disgraceful as this case is, the times are also to blame. Times in which even respectable local newspapers... ...make use predominantly of underage schoolgirls as models. And as for the innocently trusting parents... ...who believe their daughters are free from danger... ...only to discover her one day in the newspaper... ...a magazine or a sex magazine... ...who can say how many they are? A hundred. Mr. Kommert, authorized Notary. Come, child. I'll be nice with you. A hundred. Pharmacist Pantel. - This way, Chief Inspector. - Thank you. - Chief Inspector Krause. - Hello, my child. A hundred. You're driving me crazy. The schoolgirl has long been the sex symbol of our time. Is she aware of this? You're driving me crazy. Come on. You're driving me crazy! Edith, get up. It's 7:00. Oh, my God. Edith! - Do you know a Mr. Dreier? - No. - And Mr. Krause and Mr. Pantel? - No. We're not getting anywhere. - You have a daughter. - Leave her out of this. Can you look her in the eyes after what you did to Edith? How much were you paid for your dirty business? - You can't prove a thing. - We'll see about that. Get ready. You're under arrest. As a schoolgirl, have you had any sexual experiences... ...that you'd rather no one knew about? Yes, some men are pigs. I understand your desperation when you can't trust anyone. Do you think your daughter is honest with you about sex? Sure, we're like best friends. Why didn't you tell your parents? My parents? You're crazy. They would have thought I was a whore. She's right. Many parents think the worst of us. Parents this, parents that. But if the newspapers are right... ...there's more going on in the schools than you think. They're right. I experienced something similar a few years ago. It was my first sexual experience. We had a teacher, Johannes Holbach. He was the head teacher and deputy principal. A great guy, around 30. We learned a lot... ...but his teaching methods- Now for a completely different topic: Fiber. What's this? Normally, I'd say it's my breast. You'll be next soon. I wasn't asking about what's underneath, but about this. - A sweater. - Right. - What's it made of? - Wool. - And what is wool? - It comes from sheep. - And goats. - Even camels. That's right. So what is wool? Animal hair. What is your skirt made of? Pure virgin wool. - And underneath? - Panties. And what are they made of? 100% pure cotton. Easy to clean, and wash-and-wear. Correct. Where does cotton come from? It grows on trees. That's a bit of an exaggeration. Let's say it comes from plants, from the seeds of the cotton plant. Does anyone know the French word? - Coton. - Outstanding. Cotton in English. What other fibers do you know? Linen, which also comes from plants. Silk, from the silkworms- Yes, you know a lot. Very good. And what kind of fiber is this, Gisela? It's synthetic. What's the difference from all other fibers? Teacher, what material is my sweater made of? Hopefully, something that doesn't shrink. In this way we learned about natural and synthetic fibers. Holbach's classes were always funny. Everyone liked him, except for fat Alice. He didn't like her, and so she took revenge. She told her father everything, and he went to the authorities. Witness another shocking case. The perpetrator is punished, but form your own opinion. Psychologists have demonstrated... ...that young girls want to have their first experience... ...with a man who reminds them of their father. Who more so than a teacher? Seduction and sex with a minor. I don't want to testify. Me neither. But we have to. The judge was quite clear. Miss Mohndorf, at 16, you're old enough to testify under oath. You have to tell the truth in court. If you conceal anything, you'll face severe penalties. - The things that pig wants to know. - He's interrogating Gisela now. Be more precise, Miss Gisela. - What do you want to know? - Stop acting stupid! You're not a child anymore. You're all the same. No one wants to tell the truth. That pig of a teacher seduces two dozen students... ...and you all cover for him. It's outrageous! Read back the minutes. It was one afternoon when I was 14. The accused, Johannes Holbach... ... called me to the library to help him with some books. He was sorting books when I entered the room. When he saw me, he dropped all the books. We picked them up together... ...and the accused touched my breasts. I think it was an accident. How beautiful. That's all. That's not all. Strike the last remark. - What happened next? - It was so long ago. I forget. Because you want to forget. What happened? Did he reach in and touch your breasts? Surely, you weren't wearing a bra then. Not even today, if you have to know. Yes, I have to know. What happened? That tickles. It tickles, Gisela? Where exactly? Here, in the front. - Right here? - Yes. Does it tickle more like this? It goes through and through. You're a little woman. Yes? You know, Gisela... ...I can show you something... ...that goes through and through even more. And then he reached into your panties. Yes, he reached into my panties and he touched my pussy. And if you have to know, I really enjoyed it. That's all, damn it. Thank you, that's all I need. In my anger, I told him too much. He's got a nasty way of drawing out information. I'll admit what Holbach did wasn't right... ...but he's a good guy. I don't want him to be punished. What did he get out of you? Holbach took nude pictures of me in his office. That pig in there has them all on his desk. He once called me in too. You're doing so poorly in biology... ...you don't know the heart from the butt. You may have to repeat a year. So get undressed, and I'll demonstrate on a live subject. Naked? - You want to fail the class? - No, Mr. Holbach. I was curious, naturally. So I took off my clothes, of course. Besides, I wanted to see if Holbach was more than just talk. Or if the other girls had exaggerated. Look at the skeleton. It supports the human body. You can't see whether it's a man... ...or a woman. Take your breasts. Yours are shaped nicely and well-developed. The skeleton doesn't have any. That doesn't hurt. It tickles a bit. And here is the groin. The skeleton doesn't have the cute little hair either. And now your back... ...going down... ...to your bottom. Bang, I thought now it was going to happen. But I was wrong. There's a big difference... ...between your peachy bottom... ...and the skeleton's pelvis. I never knew biology was so wonderful. He was great. I had my first orgasm with him. Great finger exercise. It was in his office too. I had scraped my knee. He was all worried. I had to get undressed, and he examined me. His hands were quite busy. But that's water under the bridge. - Miss Henkels. - Yes? Come in. Do you agree that a teacher who seduces a minor must be punished? Yes, I think so. No, the girl is often guilty too. No, because who knows who seduced whom? Do you agree that a teacher who seduces a minor must be punished? Of course. A decent girl can avoid this. He got five years and seven months. The prosecutor wanted 10. We all felt sorry for him. I think he's a pig. Seducing schoolgirls! You didn't know him. He was very nice. And we weren't kids. It only seemed nasty when we had to tell it all to the court. Some judges make you sick. Of course, they got off on it. They're only men, pigs like all adults. But if we ask them questions, they get all self-righteous. - Did they ever catch you? - Yes, my father did, but it was harmless. I was almost 15 then. I knew nothing about sex, a late bloomer. I simply wasn't interested. Strange. Usually nobody's home in the afternoon. I can't believe it. My sister Hilde... ...with a young man. I swear at first I didn't know what they were doing. I wanted to laugh. It looked funny to me. But suddenly, it piqued my interest. I couldn't help watching. I had to see it all. It repelled me... ...but also fascinated me. It confused me. How can anyone lose control like that? My sister is always so serious. But all of a sudden, she's writhing, groaning, screaming. Why? Is this lust, the orgasm they talk about at school? Then she got up... ...and I saw it on him. You know what. It took my breath away. I couldn't stop thinking about what I'd seen that afternoon. I saw Hilde, her passion, her fulfillment. And I saw his member... ...that had given her so much pleasure. Without realizing it, my hands took on a life of their own... ...as I thought about the incident. I imagine the love. I imagine a man taking me in his arms. I imagine he fulfills me so much that I don't know what's happening. Then I'm shocked to realize I'm pleasuring myself... ...for the first time in my life. Is it right? It must be, because it feels great. I could scream with ecstasy... ...with ecstasy! I completely forgot we had a visitor... ...Kurt, my cousin. He always stays for a few days. Kurt is 10. By chance, I caught him in the shower. What are you gawking at? On Kurt, I saw it again, that... ...that thing that both attracted and startled me. - Want to go to the movies? - No, I'd rather play soccer. Always playing that stupid soccer. Aren't you interested in anything else? Like what? Girls, for example. You're nuts. Yeah, girls. And I'm not nuts, you're stupid. If you keep saying that, I'll hit you. I bet you don't even know what a girl looks like. - I do know. - How? -They look like you. - I told you you're stupid. - Wait. I'll show you. - Hold on! - I'm sorry. - Why? Boys scream when they get hit there. - It hurts like hell. - Girls don't scream. - There's nothing there. - Of course there's something there. What is it? Show me! I told you you don't know what girls look like. - Show me. - Only if you show me yours. But there's nothing to see. You think so? Come on then. - Only if we both go at once. - Let's go. Just the same as my mom's. Milk comes out of them, right? When you have a child. see, you've got buttons there. Fresh youth exploring life. How many poets have described it? How frequently have writers been inspired by the theme... ...that in discovering another person you discover yourself? All adults know and yet refuse to admit to their children... ...that they were once in the same situation. I really do know girls. There's a hole under that hair. What do you think it's there for? It's for that down there. Man, is that a small one. Doesn't it get bigger? No. Why? Come over here by me and put it in my hole. - How does it work? - Lie down here. Somehow we'll find a way. We have to try it out. But this afternoon you're going to soccer with me. Eintracht is playing Bayern. M?ller is a great shot. When he's given room to play, he slams in one after another. Ingrid! I can't believe my eyes! Beating is not education. This father is mistaken. He calls innocent games of curiosity acts of obscenity. Unfortunately, many adults attribute their life's problems and complexes... ...to similar disturbed and degrading childhood games. Psychologists can tell us a thing or two about this. After that circus my parents wouldn't speak to me for four weeks. It's your own fault for getting caught. Do it in the woods. That's exactly what happened when I told my parents... ...I was sleeping with my boyfriend. Oh, my. I wouldn't dare. What if you caught your daughter, still a schoolgirl... ...in bed with her boyfriend having sex? I would spank her good. - I'd say, ''Out!'' - Who? The boyfriend or your daughter? Both. I rely on her good taste, and she's on the pill anyway. -Have you explained things to your daughter? -In today's world, they find out for themselves. And probably know more than us. They should study, instead of thinking of sex. - Did you play doctor as a child? - I think we all did. That's how we found out for ourselves. Parents don't have to know everything. Most of them don't. At some point, we have to start looking for a partner. Finding a partner can be a big problem. There's a lot involved, not only sex. Girls get emotionally involved. For the man, it's only about sex. - How did you come up with that? - Because I've experienced it myself. Tell us. Well, I didn't actually experience it myself. It was my best friend. If I tell you, you'll be amazed at what goes on in this world. This is Renate. Her father's an advertising expert. Her parents didn't have any financial problems... ...but they had plenty of personal ones. Renate's mother was very ill and had been in a sanatorium for months. One day, the afternoon classes were canceled... ...and Renate came home early. That's funny. What's going on? It's Aunt Lohnie's car again. Before, we barely saw her once a year. Suddenly she's here a couple of times every week. Don't you want to come to dinner, darling? I know what you think. The situation was clear enough. Nevertheless, I'd like to give you an explanation. Look. I love your mother. No, you can believe me. But she's ill, and she's practically never home. What can I do? I'm a man in his best years. I simply need a woman's love now and then... ...physically, I mean. And Lohnie- What's the point? What did he say? He loves my mother and she isn't here. He needs love. Him, a man in his best years? My God, what will happen if he falls in love with Aunt Lohnie? It's terrible to imagine my mother coming back from the sanatorium... ...to a broken marriage. What can I do? I love your mother. I love your mother. No,you can believe me. But she's ill. I'm a man in his best years. I simply need a woman's love now and then... ...physically, I mean. What can I do? What can I do? Now that I know about it... ...should I allow it? Do I stand by and watch as my parents' marriage is broken? I love my parents. What can I do? I love your mother. No, you can believe me. But she's ill. I'm a man in his best years. I simply need a woman's love now and then... ...physically, I mean. I simply need a woman's love now and then... ...physically, I mean. I'm... a woman too. I'm a woman too. Yes, that's an idea. Maybe a crazy idea. But it's the only solution. It's the only way for me to save my parents' marriage. Put something on, darling. You'll catch a cold. Can I come to bed, Dad? Sure. If you'd like. When I was little, I always used to come to bed with you on Sundays. Remember what I always used to ask you? Just about everything, as far as I remember. I always used to ask you if you loved me. You've forgotten that? That's right. Do you love me more than Aunt Lohnie? Of course, darling. But why- Why did you do that with Aunt Lohnie today? - My child, that's completely different. - I'm not a child anymore, Dad. I want you to love me. I do love you. But not as much as Aunt Lohnie. Listen here, darling. No. I don't want you to do that with Aunt Lohnie or other women anymore. They're all cheating on Mom. Take me. Are you crazy? - The two of us aren't cheating on her. - I'm ashamed. But nobody will know. For four weeks, I've been the lover of my own father. He doesn't want to see Aunt Lohnie anymore. Tomorrow, mother's coming back from the sanatorium. All is well. In these last few moments, you have indisputably witnessed a crime. But we show it to you as more of an exceptional situation. A schoolgirl's desperate rescue attempts... ...are misunderstood as a young person's willingness to sacrifice herself. However, let's hear other schoolgirls' opinions on this. If what you're telling us is really true- I don't know. That's pretty excessive. But my friend only wanted to save her parents' marriage. But by pretty strange methods. And she probably felt really heroic. She wanted to make a victim of herself. In my opinion, she's nuts. I can almost understand the girl. But her father? No, I don't get it at all either. He should be locked up. Can you imagine being your father's lover? It'd be different from a boyfriend. But I can imagine it. Yeah, sure. He looks good. He's progressively minded. Sure. That's an unbelievable situation. I'm the father and if I really wanted something else, I wouldn't tell you. I don't want to answer that. It's indiscreet. He might be even more exciting as a man than my boyfriend. Yeah, I think I could love him. If you ask me, he should have given her a good spanking instead. - Careful about feelings. - That's right. But without feelings, you can achieve just as much. I know a case like that. It was an old girlfriend of mine. Another girlfriend. That bitch was so cold and calculating. I tell you, her character would make you throw up. And fucking was her way of asserting herself. A modern Lolita. she knows she's pretty. Every move she makes... is calculated to get her noticed, admired and desired. ...she wants to be taken. It's not about lust... ...but for her, having sexual relations with a man... ...especially with a successful man... ...is her only way of asserting herself. Sadly, it's not a rare profile, which often causes hardship. - What's wrong? - Forget it. I'm pissed off. Why? Let's finish the set. No. Well, then fuck off. Why are you brushing him off? He's been staring at your tits. - He could be useful. - Not to me. I don't do kids anymore. I don't know. I think he's almost perfect. You take him, then. We could both squeeze him to our breasts. I wouldn't do someone like him, from my school and in the same class. He can practice on someone else. The man I sleep with must be somebody who can teach me something. Like him? - Why not? - He could teach you something. I'll stay for a bit. You're going home? I'm really pissed off. Those fucking women. Take it easy. You haven't found the right one yet. - Rolf, can you take me into town? - If you want. This is Helmi Kortmann. We're in the same class. - This is my father. - Pleased to meet you. If all schoolgirls are so pretty, I'll go back to school myself. Yes? If you want to come with me, hurry up. I'm leaving. - Goodbye, Mister- - Dr. Schneider. Hope to see you soon. - Did you have to behave like that? - I do what I want. I'm not going to ask your permission. - Man, who's car is this? - My father's. Go slow. I don't want to fall off. Fine, walk then. Naturally, her spat with the young man was a trick. Lolitas are very calculating. Her target: the father. For a schoolgirl, it's great to sleep with the father of a classmate. That's what she thinks. That's why she's waiting at the exact spot his car must pass. - Nice to see you again. - Could you give me a lift? - Sure. Get in. - Thank you. I thought Rolf was taking you home. Let's talk about something else. - Did he get fresh with you? - Very much so. I can't blame him. He got his good taste from me. Do you get fresh too? You must have something against it. Otherwise, you'd be with Rolf, right? That's different. Little boys are extremely boring. I've never seen anything as sweet as you. Let's drive into the woods. It's more comfortable. Careful. You're married. Didn't Rolf tell you? I'm divorced. - Well, it's okay then. - So sweet. Oh, Doctor. Come. Come. Oh, Doctor. Oh, Doctor. Come. Oh, Doctor. Come. Oh, Doctor. Come. Come. Oh, Doctor. Come. Oh, Doctor. Oh, Doctor. Come. Oh, Doctor. - Come on. - Let go of me. Get it into your head. We're finished. Fucking jerk. - You two are through. - So what? No wonder. Helmi's got a guy with a big Mercedes. You can't compete with that. Stop yanking my chain. What do you mean? Go out to your house and see for yourself. Bye. Come here, Doctor. You're such a sweet girl. - Come. What's wrong? - Be quiet. What's up? Doctor. I've got a feeling we're being watched. Rubbish. Come on, take that off. I want to do you differently. Hi, Rolf. - Nice of you to drop by. - Hi. Hi, Rolf. Sit down. Care to eat with us? - Helmi's not here yet. - I know about that. - What do you mean by that? - Nothing. Tell us. Has something happened? Maybe you should see how your daughter fools around in her free time. That's enough. What are you saying? Don't be insolent. Our daughter isn't like that. All right. Stop beating around the bush. Tell us what you know. I can't. I won't. Ask your good daughter. He raped me after the tennis game. I couldn't defend myself. Child, why didn't you tell us? I was ashamed. Besides, it had already happened. ''It had already happened.'' That's outrageous. He took advantage of you. That Dr. Schneider belongs behind bars. - What about poor Rolf? - He's no better than his father. How often do you think he's tried it with me, that scumbag? - At least have a bite to eat. - I've lost my appetite. That won't help. No. I'll take this to the prosecutor. The prosecutor? What will I tell him? Okay, he gave me a lift. Then he stopped and threw me down on the hood. He had his way with me. I tried to fight him, but he's such a strong man. There was nothing I could do but bite the bullet... ...and hope it would be over soon. It was disgusting. He did terrible things to me. I screamed and screamed, but he just laughed. He was stronger than me. When it was all over... ...I cried and cried. The accused is found not guilty on the charge of sex with a minor. The expenses will be paid by the court. The law has spoken. Would you judge in the same way? It has been proven that of the girls between 12 and 16... ...who were involved in sexual offense cases... ...37 percent behaved provocatively... ...or willingly tolerated the contact. Thirty-seven percent of the girls have taken an equally active part. And only 20 percent have shown at least the first signs of defense. Year after year, over a thousand men go to jail in Germany. The court accuses them of seduction of a minor. Just how many men are sentenced while in reality they are innocent... ...is not revealed by any statistic. Do you know what your daughter does in her free time? She's so sly that... ...she's got an excuse for everything. What am I to do? Are you of the opinion that you can sleep with anyone? That it has nothing to do with love? First I want to try him in bed. Love comes later. Would you forgive your husband sooner for having an affair with a teenager... ...than with his secretary? No, I wouldn't. Yes, because those young things are more dangerous for a man. I don't know if I would forgive him at all... ...teenager or secretary. You guys go from one extreme to another. You could say that. see, there's nothing that- I always thought normal was normal. What is normal? A girl deciding for herself when and with whom she has sex. Aside from the last story. I once thought I could decide with whom and when I had sex. But then something happened to me that haunts me to this day. It was last summer. I went swimming with a girlfriend. Ow! - So how about tonight? - No, not interested. We're both busy. Get lost. Your loss. - What are you doing tonight? - Don't know. My homework, perhaps. - What's it about? - Democracy and freedom of the press. - Interesting? - No, but it's eight pages long. - I once dated a journalist. - What happened to him? I dumped him... ...when he tried to limit my freedom. Imagine that. He'd fallen in love with me. But that's great. Nonsense. When they fall in love, they think they own you. Like private property. And that's when he starts bossing you around. ''Don't do this. Don't do that.'' But if you love him dearly... ...you have to be there for him. No, sweetie. Love makes you dependent. Sex is great, but don't confuse it with love. I'm the boss of my own body and my own heart. - I don't know. - I do. If I like a man, I'll take him. I take him, you got that? Not the other way round. This is the age of emancipation. Ah, shit! - Look at him. - Who? The one drying his back. So? You don't have an eye for guys. Watch. I'll show you something. I'll get him. - Do you have a cigarette? - Here you go. Thank you. I'm still in school. - Do you like schoolgirls? - Why? I like you. I want to sleep with you. You don't hold back, do you? See you later. Let's be clear: I'm the one who wants it. - Well? - I've reeled him in. That night, I seduced him. At least that's what I thought. His name was Werner, an auto mechanic. He fit my profile of a real man. He was so deliciously reckless. The first man who knew how to do things to my body. I was blown away. Schoolgirls as followers of new philosophies... ...on the relationship between the sexes. They're all reading Valerie Solanas' SCUM Manifesto... ...which turns men into slaves and a necessary evil for sex. Solanas makes women the heroines of the world. Esther Vilar's book is different: The Manipulated Man. It shows that the woman is the parasite, not the man. That she lies to him and cheats on him. That she turns him into her willing tool. Interesting perspectives in our tolerant world. But where do they lead... ...when a half-informed schoolgirl makes them into her ideals? After that night, everything had changed for me. - Come on. - I'm not finished yet. Fuck it. Come on. Come. This is a good spot. I'm horny. Get undressed. - What if somebody comes by? - Get undressed and stop talking. What the hell? You don't tell me what to do. - I don't like that. - Forget it, girl. Bye. No, Werner. Stay. I didn't mean it. I'll get undressed. Keep going! - Do you like me? - Turn around. - Bend over, way over. - Please, not this way. I'm not forcing you. Stay, Werner. I'll do it. For you. Bend over. Witness how a schoolgirl who thinks she controls men... ...and can turn them into sex objects... ...becomes a victim herself. A victim of half-information and her own healthy sexual impulses. This is exactly where the man plays the dominant role. Once he realizes she's dependent, her fate's in his hands. This is also why many schoolgirls end up as prostitutes. By latest count, 80,000 in five years. Werner did me whenever and however he wanted it. Sometimes it was really humiliating. No, I don't want to. What the hell are you thinking? Don't you realize that you're trash? I'll take you whenever I want. You wanted to wear me out. But I wore you out. I'm the boss! Even on my way to school he'd catch up with me. Quick, do me. - I can't right now. - Why not? - I have to go to school. - Rubbish. I'll drop you off afterwards. See? You liked it. You just can't say no. I'm ashamed. I hate you. You treat me like a whore. I love whores who do it for free. I'll take you to school now. I know it's terrible, but I can't get away from Werner. I've wanted to so much, but I can't do it. Margot, this guy- He makes me sick. That's not true. He can be kind and very caring. But when he wants sex, my love doesn't mean anything. You're dependent on him. Get rid of him. I can't. As soon as we're together, I do whatever he says. You're stupid. Why don't you talk to your parents? My parents have enough problems. I have to do this on my own, or I'll die. Well, I haven't died yet. People can take a lot. - Have you gotten over him, Margot? - Honestly, no. But I'm trying. I told you so you could learn from it. Can you imagine yourself becoming sexually dependent on a man? Yes, unfortunately. If he's a good lover and good in bed... ...I would eat out of his hand. I don't think so. A little orgasm isn't everything. Can you see yourself becoming sexually dependent on a man? Yes. No. How many men have you been with? Six... five too many. I hope you at least have a funny story. I didn't think it was funny at the time. I was about 15, and I wanted to do it, no matter what. It was a Friday night. There was no school on Saturday... ...and I knew some tricks for getting my parents to let me stay out late. So? Shall we go to the English Garden? No, that's scary. That's silly. You got a better idea? - What about your pad? - I share it with my brother. - So what? - My brother is only 10. Shit. Down by the river there's an old wrecked VW. - We could do it there. - Are you crazy? When it's this cold, I can't do it. If I were a man, I could probably do it all the time. I think we should go home and postpone it till tomorrow. Tonight, I'm not... ...in the mood. I'll get you so much in the mood that you'll scream. TO THE SCHOOL PREMISES ENTRANCE ONLY THE MAIN PORTAL Come on, don't be afraid. Man, what a great place. - Strange. - What? The lights are on. Where are we? At my school. My father is the janitor. You have cute nipples. This... is the principal's office. Why aren't they hard? It's just the two of us. This guy has a great office. Look. The old guy is a lush. He must have had a visitor recently. What if he comes back? He's not coming back. You never know. I'll dim the lights, okay? Or my father will catch us. Get undressed. I'm done for. Don't drink so much, or you won't be able to do it. I can always drink cognac. Let's see how good this couch really is. Just one more. But that's your last one. - What's wrong? - I have to step outside. - Do you? - Everyone has to once in a while. You'd like me to believe that. - Get those clothes off. - I'm ticklish. You nearly ripped my nose off! Now, I'll eat you up. Raped. If my mommy knew. Get out of these pants. Finally! Now let's see your thing! We'll get him to wake up. Where's that little birdie? Isn't the little one a bit curious yet? And now? Well? Don't you want to drink another one before we start? Before? No... after! And now step on it! I have to concentrate first. By the time you're ready, I'll be buying a Christmas tree. And now the final attempt! - A door! - Door? What door? - Somebody's coming. - Where can we hide? - The cabinet. - On my way. Principal? And Miss Pflaumchen? We're preparing for the next parent-teacher conference. Who's that? You'll be in trouble. But for now, get in! - Stop. - Sorry. Principal? Hello? He must be here. He said he had to work late. - Stockings? - And the lights were on too. Cognac. What's this? - These aren't my husband's clothes! - Yes, they are. Mr. Meier, don't take me for an idiot. My husband doesn't wear lace panties. No, I don't think so either. - Egon! - Principal. And Miss Pflaumchen. I can't believe it! You, and a principal. Working late? I'll teach you! You motherfucker! Messing around with Miss Pflaumchen. There's someone else. Open up or I'll use force. - Mr. Meier. Break it open. - Yes, ma'am. - My daughter! - Who are you, young man? - I'm innocent. - Molester. Elfi, that's a tall tale! You saw that in a movie, eh? TV, perhaps. Really creative, even if it isn't true. Sex is great. I'll do it when I want, without asking anyone. - If something happens? - That's what the pill is for. Nonsense. I'm not talking about that. We've heard what can happen when you have sex. You want to be a nun? Those are isolated cases. Sex isn't that dangerous. You don't think so, eh? I was lucky. It was at Oktoberfest. The following story is also true. Here's an example that should worry you parents out there. - A heart for the sweethearts. - Spare me that tripe. - I'll take this. - Here's your change. Keep it. - Shall we do it here? - Wherever you want. You're unbelievable. Get up! Get dressed! Quick! I'll kill you if you scream. Don't forget the doll. Come on. One false move, and I'll pump you full of lead, get it? - Hi, Karla. - Come along. Changing partners, eh? Where's Heinz, Karla? - He left. - Change is good. Come. What a weird guy. Get in there. We're all alone. Now we'll do what you did with your friend. Do me. I'm warning you. If you do as I say... I'll be very happy. Get undressed. Slowly. I want to enjoy it. I want to enjoy myself. Didn't I say slowly? Please, let me leave. Show me your body. Legs apart. Beautiful. How old are you anyway? Fourteen. Fourteen. My schoolgirl. You make me so happy. Once again, a schoolgirl has been victimized. Once again, we're asking whose fault it is. But this time, we provide an answer. Sex offenders find their victims in crowds. There's a reasonable law to protect minors in public. But the enforcement of this law relies on supervision... ...parental supervision... ...your supervision. Here, you share the blame. Would you let your 14 year-old daughter go to Oktoberfest alone? No. Drunken guys go after the girls. Parents who allow this are irresponsible. - How old are you? - Fourteen. Are you allowed to stay out at night? No, only until 10:00, but I always find an excuse that my parents believe. Are you allowed to stay out at night? Not long, sometimes. Like on weekends. - The entire night? - No. Makes you lose interest in Oktoberfest. You can only trust a man if you really love him. - Do you believe in finding the one? - Yes. I do believe in it. What is that anyway, ''the one''? The one is the one I'm screwing. Stop it. You only care about fucking and orgasms. Let's be honest. We're all looking for a nice boy we can love. Now I'll tell you a story. It was a year go. It was fall. The girl I'm talking about was Beate Kemper. She was in love for the first time... ...with a boy from the neighborhood, Peter Baumgartner. - Did I keep you waiting? - No problem. - Let's walk a bit. - Okay. Do you know what I want? That we'll always have each other. I love you. I'll always be with you, no matter what happens. I don't like not seeing you for a while... ...but I have to go to the university in Munich. Listen. What is it? I'm scared, very scared. Don't talk like that. Let's go to my place. I have some great new records. Do you want to come? - Let's go then. - I'd follow you anywhere. - How long can you stay? - Not long. My father, you know. I know. I'm not good enough. I'm too poor. Not everyone has a big construction company like him. My dad is only an employee, but he's all right. - What's wrong? - It's already happened. That's my father's car. Has he come to see your father? No, Mr. Baumgartner. save it for someone who cares. Youthful friendships, harmless. Not at all. Your Peter is fooling around with my innocent Beate. She would be a great catch for him, but no way. - Mr. Kemper, are you saying- - Yes, I am. And as long as you don't put a stop to your son... ...frankly, you're as guilty as he is. Mr. Kemper. This is outrageous and slanderous. I won't let some guy who's a nobody marry my only daughter... ...so he can live off of the fortune I've built. You can boss your employees around, but this is my home. I won't be insulted by you. Fine. I'm leaving. But your son will keep his paws off my daughter. I'll hold you responsible. Well, well, well. A conspiracy. Now I get it. My daughter and the nice Mr. Baumgartner. And this is their love nest, eh? I'll report you, Mr. Baumgartner. I'll have you put behind bars, you pimp. - Father! - Shut up. Mr. Kemper. Look at this bum of yours. Leave my home at once. I will. Come, child. Father? It's better you don't see her again. It looked as if that was the end of their great love. But it wasn't. A few weeks later, Peter was in Munich studying. He was lucky. He'd found a nice room. Mr. Baumgartner. What a nice surprise. Mr. Baumgartner, you have a visitor. Beate. Come in. Come, sit down. Let me look at you. Your eyes. I've missed them so much. And your skin. I've missed your skin so much. How did you get to Munich? I ran away. Ran away from home. I couldn't stand it without you. I don't want to go back. - Mr. Baumgartner. - What is it? - What's your son's address? - None of your business. My daughter is gone. She's with him in Munich. - They plan to commit suicide. - Oh, my God. We have to go to Munich. My wife called me. Beate left a suicide note. - Can I come with you? - Of course. Come. If only time stood still. Why can't we be happy? I can't live without you. Me neither. And I don't want to. No one can keep us apart. No one. No. There's no other way for us. This must be it. - Peter! - Beate! - Why are you screaming? - Thank God, they're alive. We wanted to poison ourselves. But then we realized that life is too beautiful. Yes, too beautiful to have it destroyed by you. That was my story. Even if you think it's corny, I like it. Is it true? Yes, and it happens more often than you want to admit right now. Maybe Edith is right. A bit of romance is nice. It depends on your perspective. Come on, guys. Dinner's ready. This has been Schoolgirl Report 3. We think it was more critical and more daring. Surely, it has opened your eyes once more. For that reason, you needed to see it. And for that reason, everyone must see it.
