RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM Good morning, Patty. Here's the overview from this Monday, thanks. How's the episode going? Running a little over. How's it going out there? Guess what? I got Myra Hudson to agree to do an interview next week about the triathlon scandal. Great work. I know! When are you gonna take that journalistic instinct behind the mic? And host? Yeah. No, that's not my thing. I will leave the storytelling to the professionals. I am perfectly fine behind the scenes. Let's see where they're at, yeah? And so you were saying you found yourself at a crossroads? Yeah, before fate stepped in and helped me find my passion. I was overworked, overstressed, and a job that offered me security, but I wasn't happy. So I sat back and thought what it was I wanted and how I might find my own voice, how I could put myself front and center for a change. Great, so how'd you do it? I took a trip, got away from it all. Gave myself time to think. And where'd you go? - Iceland. - Iceland. Just something about it there. It's rejuvenating. Right, and did it work? It did, an idea formed, I dove in with both feet, and I haven't looked back since. Well, thank you for sharing your story with us today. This is Building Blocks, a podcast about innovators and the movements they built. And for all of you out there listening, until next time, may you find your own story. Are we cut? - What? - Are we cut? Yes, yes. And we're out, guys, great job. Chloe. Hey, Rick. You got a minute? Yeah. As I'm sure you're aware, subscriber counts have been slowly dropping off since last year. And advertising revenue along with it. The programming slate needs a shakeup. I'm looking for new podcast ideas and I'd love to find something that stands out. Something with heart. Heart? Yeah, a show people can connect with on an emotional level. Okay, yeah, yeah, I'll start thinking about it. Knew I could count on you. And Chloe? I'd like to have these on my desk in a couple of weeks. Really wanna hit the ground running this year. You got it. I swear, if I have to go to one more holiday lunch party or soiree, whew! I thought things were supposed to slow down after the holidays. You have my sympathy, that sounds awful. No, it really is, it's so overrated. Well, why don't you bring a date? Would that make it more fun? That's even more overrated. True. But what about you? Did you ever call that cute lawyer back? No, I didn't. I feel like I just have no time for myself. All I do is work. And I have to come up with all these new podcast ideas to turn in to my boss in the next couple weeks and it just feels so hard to come up with something that hasn't already been explored. You know, maybe you need to, like, I don't know, take a vacation or just go somewhere and find some perspective? Get outta your routine, get a suntan. Yeah. Oh, look! Oh my gosh. We're babies! - So cute! - 10 years ago, I can't even believe it. We went on the best trips in college, right? So fun. This is a sign. For what? Both of us, we just need to, like, take a week and just leave everything behind and go somewhere. I do have a bunch of vacation days. - Really? - And airline miles. Wait, so? Let's do it. Wait, really? Yeah! Let's do it. This is so impulsive, this is so unlike you, I love it. Wait, where are we gonna go? Hawaii, Porta Verde, Cartagena... What about Iceland? Iceland? I heard about it on our podcast and it just sounded so transformative. And cold. Although I do hear they have very handsome men. I need to go to a place that I can get inspired and gain perspective, not fall asleep on a beach. You know what? You have never steered me wrong and so I'm in. Let's do it. We're going to Iceland. - We're going to Iceland? - Yeah. Oh my god! Hey, maybe we could get the whole gang to go. Yeah, that would be amazing. I'll call Kenneth and Erin and then, there's Charlie? Yeah, I don't know. I mean, he's always traveling, and besides, I have no idea where in the world he is right now. My job as a travel photographer is to capture the world around us. You have to be quick, you have to be patient, but most importantly, you've gotta be able to roll with the punches. I mean, you could be capturing a beautiful beach in Tahiti one moment and then the next moment, you're drenched in a torrential downpour, which brings me to my most important point. Always travel with an extra pair of socks. Lights please? Thank you, Mr. Hughes. And now I'm sure my students are bursting with questions. Yeah, anybody, anybody? How about here? What's your favorite filter? Actually, I like to shoot clean if possible. It just gives me more latitude when I go to edit. I mean for social media. Like Sierra, Gingham, Lo-Fi? Call me old fashioned, but I think the best filter is instinct and experience. But I do have a soft spot for Valencia. Next question? And how about here? Great. That was wonderful. I think my students would have sat for another hour. Thank you again for finding the time for us. I'm glad we could finally make it work. You know, the university's still looking to cover my position the rest of the semester. I'd like to put a word in for you. I'm actually up for a job in Tokyo, fingers crossed. Before that, I'm going to Morocco for two weeks for a travel magazine and then I am off to Antarctica. And after that? Don't know. You know, it might be nice to stay in the same place for longer that a few months. Where's the fun in that? Let's go to Iceland. - Stunning! - My goodness. I cannot believe we're actually in Iceland! I can believe it. I'm so excited. I feel like you were right, this is what I needed, just a place to recharge and relax and wait for creativity to hit me. There's Kenneth! Hey, guys! Hey! It's so good to see you two. So good to see you, hi! I almost forgot what you look like, it's been so long. - It hasn't been that long. - It has! Well, yeah, it has. I mean, I know he looks a little older, but just as handsome. Trending on distinguished. So I guess we should head to the chalet? Yeah, let's go! Actually, we're waiting on one more. There he is. We hired a tour guide. You did? I gave him all our information. He'll take us to the chalet, show us the sights. That's really sweet but I've been planning this since I booked the tickets. I mean, the whole week is already planned. Chloe, it's your vacation too. You shouldn't have to spend it leading us around. For once. Exactly, and it's all-inclusive, so we just get to go along for the ride. Yeah, great. Chloe, you get to sit back and let someone else make all the decisions. Doesn't that sound relaxing? No, not at all. Kenneth? - That's me. - All right, hi. And these must be your friends. - Hi. - Hi. Hi, my name is Johann Thormanson. Such an Icelandic name. Well, Thormander is the name of my father, so Thormanson means son of Thormander. I'm Chloe and this is Isabella and Erin and Kenneth. So welcome to Iceland. Thank you. I'm gonna show you all the best this country has to offer and we are going to have a fantastic week. Now we have a saying here in Iceland. What? On with the butter. It means let us forge ahead. Yeah, okay. So just to the car. - Okay. - On with the butter. Right. Welcome to Langjokull Long Glacier. Unbelievable. The vikings, they settled here in the ninth century and they would launch these explorations from these shores. Amazing. And Leif Erikson, he even set out from here and then discovered North America. Really? I didn't know that. Is that a seal? - Oh! - Oh my gosh. Come on, take a picture. How about you? What led you here? The three of us went to school together at Northwestern. Izzy and Kenneth and I. How wonderful that you remain friends. Yeah. Isabella moved back to Chicago about a year ago, so she lives there, but Kenneth and Erin live in New York and we always used to travel together. I mean, every spring vacation and summer. We've backpacked the world together. I don't know, I just needed some perspective and to clear my head, so Izzy just got everybody back together. The spirit of Iceland helped guide the vikings back home from their journeys, helped them find their true north. Maybe this journey will do the same for you. All right, guys, all this talk of journeys surely worked up your appetites. Who's hungry? Starving. All right, guys, I think you will love the next place. Let's go. Oh my goodness. - There you go. - Thank you. What was the name of that street we turned down? Gesundheit. It's so beautiful. Well, I'm glad you like it, because this is your home for the week. - Really? - Seriously? Oh my gosh, this so beats the hostels we used to stay in, back in the day with the 24 bunk beds and tons of people. Oh my. Johann. I just, I had a question. I know that you probably have a set itinerary but before I left, I made a list of places that I wanted to see and I was hoping that maybe you could incorporate some? Yeah, I'll do my very best. - Okay. - Yeah. And what are the chances we get to see the Northern Lights? I'm just dying to. I can't promise that. We'll need a little bit of luck on our side. Right, of course. Well, you can just hang onto those then. All right, thank you. Guys, let's head inside and I'll take care of the luggage. - Thank you. - And I'll come grab you in half an hour. Our tour guide's pretty cute, huh? I hadn't noticed. I'm just saying we're on the trip of a lifetime in a beautiful country. Why not say yes to just a little romance? Isabella. - Hi. - Hi! - Hello. - Hi, welcome. I'm Kristian and this is my wife Anna. We're the caretakers of this bed and breakfast. We can't wait to show you around. But first... We have a special treat prepared. - Okay, come on inside. - Thank you so much. Here we have layers of almond cake and spiced plum jam. It's a traditional Icelandic winter staple. It's called Vinarterta. Well, I can't pronounce it but I can certainly eat it. - Thank you. - Enjoy. Please let us know if you need anything else. Thank you. Oh, yummy. Let's do a toast. Of course. To friendship, fate, and reuniting after all of these years. - Hear hear. - Plus Erin. Hey, guys. You made it! Hi, Charlie. Hi, Chloe. What are you doing here? Charlie was running late, so I texted him the itinerary. No, I mean in Iceland. Kenneth invited me? You said we were getting the gang back together, so I called Charlie. Thought you'd talked to him about it. Yeah, I did say that, but I didn't... Were you not gonna tell me about the trip? I was going to. You're just really difficult to get ahold of. But I'm happy that you guys got in touch, this is great. It's so good to see you. We're so glad you're here. It's been way too long. Yeah. You gotta try this. Get in there. And Erin, I am so sorry that I missed the wedding. But I saw all the photos and I felt like I was there. Hi. Look, when Kenneth called, I thought that you'd given the green light, and I feel like I'm just blindsiding you here. I'm just surprised, that's all. It's, that's really all. Right. Look, I don't have to stay. I don't wanna make you uncomfortable, I don't wanna make this weird... No, don't be silly, I'm not uncomfortable, I'm... Sure, because I mean, it was a long time ago, right? And we're both adults, so it's fine. So, good. - Great. - Great. Awesome. - Chloe? - Yeah? Think you left your phone in the Jeep, yeah. Thank you. That's sweet of you. Johann, this is Charlie. Charlie, this is Johann, he's the tour guide. Very nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Yeah. I'm gonna be joining the group. All right, wonderful. So we're leaving in 15 minutes. Okay. Johann, I hope you don't mind a backseat tour guide. Chloe here is very particular when it comes to her game plan. Preparation is not a crime. Well, I'm happy for any help she has to offer. Well, thank you. Yeah, all right. - Really? - Yeah. There you go. Sorry. Got enough warm clothes? I'm sorry, I remember somebody telling me to always pack extra socks. Touche. So guys, welcome to the secret lagoon. For years, the location has been kept secret by the locals, hence the name. It's said the water's warm properties and the mineral deposits provide a relaxation benefits. A dip in the lagoon may be just what you need to wash your cares away. I'm gonna need a long soak. So wait, how long were you guys together? - Charlie and I? - Yeah. Three years. So what happened? Sorry, if you don't mind me asking. Oh, no, she'll talk about it. Because Chloe is capital O, capital K okay with it. I am okay with it. We dated in college and then he got a photography job overseas. And then you had that great job offer in Chicago and were starting your own career. Do you wanna tell it? No, you're doing a great job. Okay, so his photo shoots took him all over the world and we did try to do the long distance thing for a while, but you know. Anyway, I've moved on. Questionable. And so has he. Remains to be seen. So it's in the past. Great. Anyway, let's just not talk about my relationship with Charlie. I'm sure the boys aren't sitting around talking about relationships, right? Relationships are a complicated thing, man. Sounds like it. How is it being back around Chloe? I know you two didn't split up on the best of terms. We just wanted different things, that's all. Still. What's changed? Come on, you must get tired of the whole nomad thing. I like that I can go where my camera takes me. I'm not tied down to anyone or anything. It's what I want. But is it all you want? No. I could really go for one of those mud masks. Be right back. Okay, now, this is perfect. Can we just stay here for the rest of the trip maybe? Just right here. That's a great idea. 22 minutes. That's pretty long. Wait, what are you guys talking about? That's the amount of time that it took Charlie to break away from the group. Charlie! Charlie was always wandering off. Really? You remember Guadalajara? It's like we got lost for eight hours. Yeah, but I found this great taqueria, - so it was worth it. - Not worth it. Yes, it was! It got so bad Chloe got him this old army compass from a street vendor just in case he lost his way again. That's sweet. - That's a very nice gesture. - It was more just to keep us on some sort of a schedule, you know? So do you still have it? Yeah, yeah. I'm not sure exactly where it is, but I know I've got it. Probably in a box somewhere. Hey, Is, will you take a couple photos of us? We want to send it to Erin's parents. - Oh, yeah. - Oh, guys, I've got a great spot for that. Come here. Great. Do you wanna get out, maybe get some hot chocolate or something? All right. So you still at that marketing firm? No, I haven't been there in years. Really? I work at a place called Racket. It's a podcast network. Do you have a podcast? I don't host one. I'm a producer, so I mainly just do research and scheduling, stuff like that. Not super exciting. Hey, so why Iceland? I mean, you coulda spun the globe and picked anywhere in the world, so why this place? I actually heard about it on a little thing called a podcast. You know, I thought it had something to do with one of your books. My books? - Yeah. - What books? Those huge heavy ones that you were always carrying around. Myths and legends. Yeah, those ones, yes, yes. They were stacked floor to ceiling in your dorm room. So what about you? Why'd you come on this trip? You were gonna be here. I mean, you and Kenneth and, and Isabella. I mean, the whole gang was getting back together. I wasn't gonna miss it. To getting the gang back together. Getting the gang back together. This looks good. Good morning. Good morning. You're up early. Wanted some of that Icelandic air. What about you, getting some morning shots? Best light. It's gorgeous. You know, I thought that you relinquished your tour guide duties to Johann. I have. This is for work actually. I'm supposed to come up with some new ideas for podcasts for my boss. Sounds great, how's it going? It's going well, I think. I see a lot of potential. And this scribble I think could be a good one and that heart might be sweet. You got a logo. Right? Morning, early birds. - Good morning. - Good morning. Hope you enjoyed your first night in Iceland. I slept like a baby. - Really? - It was great. I'm so happy to hear it. Well, if you're hungry, I will be putting out a little something in the dining room in a couple of minutes. - Sounds great. - All right. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Let me guess, you're starving? It's true. Anna, what is this? It's pickled herring, it's a classic. You know, I think I had that on the plane. - You sure? - Yep. Here you go. So this is the breakfast every visitor needs to try. Is this yogurt? It's called skyr. It's similar to yogurt. It's so rich. Yeah, I can see why everyone likes it. Good. I have a particular fondness for skyr. You know, without it, I may have never met my husband. That's a story I wanna hear. I wouldn't want to bother you with that. - No, no, no, no. - No, no, no, you have our full attention. - Really? - Yeah. Well, in that case. Kristian, I was just telling this lovely couple... - We're not a couple. - We're not a couple. I was just telling our guests the story of how we met. And I was selling my homemade skyr at the market. I was selling my fresh berry jam from my farm. And the customers, they were going back and forth between our stalls. And they all said one was the perfect complement to the other. And I just knew that I had to meet her, so I asked her on a date that very afternoon. Where did you go? Restaurant. I figured let's let someone else make the food for a change. Well, that's a lovely story. I know it's not particularly grand, but it's our story. Well, if you'll excuse us, we'd better get back to the kitchen. - Yeah, yeah. - When the rest wake up, I'd like to have a fresh pot of coffee waiting. Thank you. I see you found a book. I hope you don't mind. I've just always been in love with these stories. Of course. In fact, why don't you keep it? Really? It's yours. Thank you. That was sweet. Really? What? Nothing. Oh, no, Chlo, you don't have to do that. It's fine, I was clearing mine anyway, it's no big deal. Just once, I would love it if you let us do something for you. I'm just taking in some dishes, it's not like I made your beds or anything. You did that, didn't you? I did make the beds. Anyway, are you guys almost done? Because we gotta go. I didn't think Johann was picking us up until later. I may have asked Johann to tweak the itinerary just a little bit. Chloe, we hired Johann so you wouldn't have to plan everything. I'm not planning everything. I'm planning a thing, singular. And we need to leave in six minutes, so be ready, okay? - What? - Chloe! Six minutes? This is it! Right? Yeah. And there's a myth that there's a hidden treasure of gold behind it, so maybe we can find it. That's incredible. I know, it's so beautiful, isn't it? No, I meant you. You should be a tour guide. I don't know about that. See, even the tour guide thinks you're the tour guide. Okay, Kenneth. Well, guys, you might be interested to know that many of the Icelandic waterfalls have their own legends. Right. Like elves at the end of rainbows, right? Which is kind of like their version of leprechauns and pots of gold. Yeah, that's right. Well, what are we waiting for? Yeah, let's go get closer. And another one is known as the waterfall of the gods. Yes, I was just reading about that. I grabbed a book at the chalet that was all about Icelandic myths. Well, you chose a good book. There was a picture of a Norse goblet on the cover. Do you know anything about that one? No. But I do know when it comes to Norse mythology that sometimes things appear before you for a reason. To herald new beginnings. I should get a photo, right? Hey guys, come on up! Here, let me take it. It's all right, man, it's what I do. It's your trip, guys. Let him take it. You should be in it for once. Fine, all right. Just point and click. Point and click, okay. All right, get in. Thank you! All right, everyone say smyr! Smyr! Oh my gosh, this is crazy. This is incredible. How is this even real? I know. Guys, I read that they don't know where the caves are gonna form from one year to the next. Yeah, finding them is part of the adventure. It's like we're in a real life Disney movie. Very different from your home in Chicago? I mean, we have a lot of snow and ice, but no, nothing like this. I mean, the colors, this is so vivid, it's so blue. Where's Charlie? He was just next to me. I'll go see if he's up here. Be careful. Hey. You know, we're really supposed to stick with the group. Not really my style. I know. But I am wondering what is down that path. I don't know, maybe more ice? Where are you going? I'm going to find out. You coming with me? Absolutely not. Come on. We're supposed to stick to the designated route. Just a quick peek and then we will catch back up with the group. Trust me. Quick peek. That's all I said. Hello? Light in here is amazing. Make sure you send those to me. Really? Yeah, I love your photographs. Those ones you did in Australia, the panoramas, they were amazing with the red rock that when... What? You went to my travel exhibition. I, no, I didn't. Okay. I mean, well, I did, I guess. I stopped by while it came through Chicago, but just because it was like an awful snowstorm and I had nowhere to. Careful. - You okay? - Yeah. Charlie, Chloe? We should go back, yeah? Yeah. Right. Hey. Ready? You go ahead. All yours. No, no. I don't want it. You were reaching for it. I changed my mind. Well, don't change it on my account. We should play a game. Come on, it'll be fun. You remember fun, right? I have fun! You are cross-referencing bus routes. And enjoying it. And having a lot of fun. Where's Kenneth? Johann offered to take them into town to pick up a few things. That's really nice of him. - I know. - Yeah. - Hey! - I love Iceland. You guys are just in time for our game. I wanna play a game. Yeah, Johann, how about you? You wanna play? I should be getting home soon. No, no. Actually we do need one more for even teams. Yeah, Johann, you should stay. Okay, so what are we playing? The Abominable Snowman? Got it. How do they do that? That's amazing. Okay, that brings you guys up to 10 points. I mean, you know, guys, we don't really have to necessarily keep score. We could just keep this a friendly little game. Sweetie, we're winning, take the points. Good point, taking 'em. I could go for another cup. Would you like another one? Yeah, thank you, that'd be great. You know, I could take one too. Yeah, sure. I'll just bring the pot. - Yeah. - Yeah. All right. He was up for it. We're up, champ. - Yes. - Go, go. Come on, show 'em how it's done. And go. A log, a bench, a man, a stop sign, a bear, a sun, a star. You? I haven't drawn anything? A choo choo train, a tree? An earring? You know, guess, come on, come on. I don't know. 10 seconds! It's large. Carrot, is it a carrot? It's a carrot, it's a carrot, right? It's not, it's a carrot. - Time's up. - Sorry. It's a ski jumper. Are you sure? Thanks, Johann. And you're up. All you have to do is draw what's on the card. Here you go. I believe in you. Can I take this very nice carrot down? Ski jumper! And go. Okay, a person throwing something to another, snowballs, snowball fight? - Yes! - Yes! What? Everyone. Nope. So guys, today we will go to Thingvellir, which is where the vikings had their parliament. Actually, I was thinking that maybe today, we could stray from the schedule a little bit. Stray as in? As in, you know, go with the flow, see what kind of trouble we can get into. We didn't come to Iceland to get into trouble. No, I did. I'm sure you did. Come on, it's not a real adventure without a little spontaneity, right? I'm happy to accommodate. I mean, would you prefer to spend today on different excursions? I heard some locals talking about a sea village by the coast where the vikings landed their ships. And what is there to do in this sea village? I don't know, we'll find out when we get there. It might be nice to do something a bit more... Adventurous? - That would be fun. - Okay, let's take a vote. Who wants to go to parliament? Or who wants to have an adventure? I guess the group has spoken. You know, I just realized, there are hardly any trees. That's because the vikings, they needed to clear the forest for farmlands and then they would take the wood and make ships and repair them. Is that true? Yeah. Look, horses. Let's stop and take a selfie with them. We have horses at home, Is. Not Icelandic horses, Kenneth. That is a good point. All right, just, everyone just hold still. Okay. Okay. Let's see what that was. All right, just take care when you go outside, guys. Yeah. That's not good. All right. Wait, guys. There is a bus stop nearby, so you can still get to your viking village. If you hurry, you can make the next bus. Yeah, we've heard that phrase while traveling before. Right? No, you shouldn't have to do this by yourself. Charlie, you should help him change the tire. - Yeah, yeah, I can help. - No, don't worry about it. Just please, go and enjoy your day, guys. - Really? - Yeah. You know what, I'll stay. Yeah, you know, I really like these horses. They're really cute. And maybe I'll like take a hike or something. Yeah, I'm serious, you guys go. You sure? Okay, let's do it. Have fun. See you soon. Bread on the butter. That's not right, is that right? Well, close enough. Never changed a tire before, so I won't be any help at all. Do you wanna go pet the horses? Yes. Certainly, yeah, let's go. There you go. - Wait, wait, wait, wait! - Wait, wait, wait, wait! Oh man. I think we missed it. Think we definitely missed it. - Yeah. - Cool. Okay, well, our next bus arrives in another two hours. - No. - Yes. It's London all over again. Wait, what happened in London? We missed the bus because Charlie wouldn't stop posing with the guards at Buckingham Palace. Look, yeah, but I was this close to getting that guy to crack a smile. Good job. Come on. All right, no bus, let's improvise. Okay. We could take that. - This is great. - Worth it. We gotta go get souvenirs for our families. Yeah, I need to do all the shopping. We didn't bring enough carry-on. We'll get another one. Yes. Okay, bye guys. Bye! I need that! I think I need that kind of energy. I know. So, where to? No souvenirs for you? Not super big on souvenirs. Okay. That looks kind of delicious. How can you be hungry? We just ate. What better way to explore a country than to sample all of its food? All of the food. Yes. All right, let's try it. What have you got here? Rugbrauo. - Rugbrauo? - Rugbrauo. The traditional Icelandic rye bread. It is actually cooked in a special container and buried next to the hot springs. Lava-baked bread. You wanna try? Count me in. - There you go. - Yeah, thank you. Oh man. How about it? I thought you said no more museum tours today. It has the word viking in it, I'm an easy target. Look at that ship. What's this? "With the long dark winter nights, "storytelling became a way to entertain. "And now, tales of Norse gods, like Odin, "have entertained the world over." Yes, they have. That's the Norse goblet I've been reading about. "The Mead of Poetry, a mythical brew that was said "to grant wisdom and inspiration to anyone who drank it." "Some believe the mead granted Odin the gift "of poetry to woo his wife Freya." That's so beautiful. But I've always been a hopeless romantic. A sucker for an epic love story. You know, it's actually one of the things I like best about you. That's it. Epic tales of love. For the podcast, it's perfect! Just couples sharing how they fell in love. I would listen to that, would you? I think it's a great idea. - Really? - Yeah. I should write it down before I forget it! Thank you. Okay, so 30 minutes, one couple. Each person tells their side and then we cut between the two to tell a linear story. With narration, right? Why not just interview them together? I feel like you wouldn't get the truth that way. Plus there's perspective. There's always two versions of a love story and part of the fun is seeing how each person remembers certain moments, like how something can be completely insignificant to one person and mean the world to the other. Give me an example. Okay, do you remember when we went to go see "Casablanca" freshman year on the lawn of the student union? Yeah. And you brought a handkerchief. Do you remember that? Well, I brought it because I knew you'd be crying when Ingrid Bergman got on the plane. That was a really significant moment to me. I realized that you were somebody that I could really care about. I did not know that. Yeah, perspective. Sorry, work. No. So where are you off to next? Morocco. And I'm waiting to hear about this job in Tokyo actually. How do you do it? Live out of a backpack? Crazy. When somebody asks me what my favorite photograph is that I've taken, you know what I say? No. The next one. But look, I've got the freedom to go wherever I want and I just, I love it that I can lose myself in the world. It just sounds more like an escape than a real life. Not to judge. It's never dull. Well, sure, but isn't it lonely? Actually, I recently got offered a job teaching photography at a university in Chicago. Really? Are you surprised? No, no, no, no. You would be great at that. Think so? Of course. There's nobody more talented at what they do than you. They'd be lucky to have you. I just was surprised because it would be a huge life change for you. It'd be different. What? I just love this song, it's so beautiful. Yeah. - Here? - Why not? Because it's a pub. Come on. No, it's embarrassing. Come on, be embarrassing. Thank you. We'll take a short break and be back soon. Hi. You guys sounded so beautiful together. Thank you. It's nice of you to say. I'm Chloe, this is Charlie. Hi, guys. Blessed to meet you both. So did you guys always sing together or? Oh, well, that's a long story. Well, I'd love to hear it, if you wouldn't mind. We could buy you some hot chocolates? Yeah, sure. So I was a classically trained pianist and he played the violin. We met at a recital and just really connected. Yeah. But we went our separate ways and I thought I would never see her again. Yeah, then years later, a friend invited me to a concert to see a metal band and guess who was playing in the band? Yeah, they needed a violinist. It was a very progressive metal band. So then what was it like when you two reconnected? She was just like I remembered her. It was like no time had passed at all. Yeah. It was such a surprise that we found each other again after all those years. Yeah. Fate certainly works in mysterious ways. You think your life is one thing, but then you realize it's all been leading to something different. Something better. I know. That couple's story was so sweet, wasn't it? It was. Hey, thanks for convincing me to shake up the itinerary and go to the viking village. Anytime. You know, I think that they had some fun too. I have to get this. - Okay. - No. - Okay. - Come on, really? No, this is amazing. Well, look who's the photographer now? Are you kidding me? If the roles were reversed, they would take so many photos their phones would run out of storage. - I gotta get one. - Okay. I think you should host it. Your podcast, I think you should host it. No, I don't think so. I just like listening. I love hearing the moments that make people's lives special. That is what would be so great about it. Most people don't know how to listen. I don't like being the center of attention really. And then being the personality that holds an entire podcast together, it's a lot of pressure. For what it's worth, I think that you would be great at it. And who knows, maybe this is the thing that you can share with the world. I don't think that's the road I'm on. Could be. Look, I know that this is a little outside your comfort zone but maybe that is just the thing you need. You know, maybe this podcast could be something different. Something better. It's great. - Really? - Yes. So send it before you change your mind. Okay. See? That wasn't that hard, was it? It was kinda hard. Look who it is! - Hey! - Hi! Hey, stranger. Somebody made it back okay. Yeah, we actually had a really great day. I made Johann take like 47 selfies with those little horses and then after he fixed the tire, we just found a little town and had a great lunch. It was really lovely. Yeah. And did you guys make it to the viking village? By land or by sea. We always find a way. And I got this. Couldn't stop him. That actually looks great on you. And we met the sweetest couple that had the most amazing love story and it gave me an idea that I just sent over to my boss. I mean, it's not perfect, but it's got potential. Best of all, Chloe wants to host it. Wait, Chloe, that's great. See, I knew this trip would inspire something in you. That's the thing about great adventures, they will lead you somewhere unexpected. Which is why to make up for the Jeep snafu earlier, I have booked you guys a special evening at one of Iceland's most special places. The Bubble Hotel. Really? Oh my gosh, thank you so much! I've wanted to go there. I keep thinking that thing's gonna start rolling and I'm gonna have to run around inside it like a giant hamster. Tell me more about the viking village. Did you bring anything back? We got some amazing Icelandic candy. Really? Yes, you should try some. So what you thinking about? I just really hope we get to see the Northern Lights. Oh yeah, same. You know, in all my travels, never seen 'em. You haven't? I'm surprised. Yeah, me too. And it would be one heck of a photo. I know. So beautiful. Where have you been that has them? Spent some time in the Outback in Northern Canada. Too cloudy, whole time. I gotta take this, do you mind? Yeah, yeah. Hey, Mark, what's going on? Charlie, how is Iceland? Icy? You know, people always assume that, but actually it is an amazing place. You gotta come here, man. Awesome, listen. I have some good news. The client in Tokyo, they wanna work with you. No kidding. Man, that's great. It's awesome, this is a huge account. There's one tiny little change of plans though. They want you to squeeze it in before Morocco. Charlie, hello? No, I'm here, I'm here, sorry, yeah. What's going on? I thought you wanted this. I did. No, I do, I do, Mark. I want it. It's just, can you give me a couple of days to think about it? Not really, we have to get you on a plane in three days. Three days, huh? Yeah, the client has a firm deadline for delivery. Listen, there's some big event in the city and they want a panoramic view of the Tokyo skyline as it lights up with fireworks. Yeah, that sounds great. It's just... What? It's not like there's anything keeping you in Iceland. Hey, Mark, give me a couple of days to think, all right? I'll let you know in 48 hours. No, Charlie... Right, bye. It's Rick. Hey. I love it. Really? That's great. Yeah, it's perfect, has that heart we're looking for. Already forwarded it to a bunch of talent. About that. I was actually thinking that maybe I could host it. I had no idea you were serious about that in your email. I've thought a lot about it and I have so much passion for this. Chloe, you are so good at what you do. Honestly, we'd fall to pieces without you. But if it ain't broke. Yeah. No, no, no, I get it. Look, as soon as you get back to the office, we are gonna get right to work on this, I promise. It's gonna be something special. Okay. Well? He loved it. That's great. But he doesn't want me to host it. I mean, it was a long shot anyway. I'm sorry, Chloe. It's okay. Just wasn't meant to be. All right, we are getting out of the cold and we are gonna drown our sorrows in some baked goods. So, guys, it is a big day. There's a lot to catch up on. I won't give too much away, but let's just say that I hope you enjoy a good yodeling. Kenneth does. You're never allowed to say yodeling in front of Kenneth. We hadn't warned him. - Hey. - What? Play hooky with me. What? Yeah, if your boss doesn't think that you can host the podcast, let's prove him wrong. How are we gonna do that? Well, I'm not a producer, but I do happen to have a fancy record button on my camera. I wouldn't know where to begin. Just think of it as a rehearsal, a test run. You just start talking, I will film it, we'll watch it back later, and who knows? Maybe you won't even hate it. Maybe I will. There's only one way to find out. And I talked to Anna already and they said that we could borrow their truck. What about the tour? I don't think they're gonna miss us. Look, Chloe. Do you want this? I do. Then maybe seeing your passion will help convince Rick. All right, let's do it. Yes. Okay, not bad, right? No. So Anna gave me our first lead. Okay. It's the couple that owns this lighthouse. Their 35th wedding anniversary was announced in the paper today and I told them that we were researching a podcast that was gonna be in the States. Okay. Sounds good, right? - Yeah. - All right, shall we? Yeah, let's do it. We met at the. It's a festival in town. She was standing by the. I noticed right away she was the prettiest girl I'd ever seen. I knew I had to speak with her, so I offered to buy her a slice. He was so sweet, I didn't have the heart to tell him that I don't like chocolate. We spent the whole day together. I don't think I ever laughed quite so much in my life. And that night, he took me to Diamond Beach. It's a special tradition for every visitor. You write a wish on a piece of parchment, you burn it, so it may reach the stars. So what did you wish for? More time. I was setting off on my boat the next day. He fancied himself an explorer, a man of the sea. So what changed? I was gone for a few weeks when I realized that my heart was simply no longer in it. I wished to return. So then you sailed back to her? Not right away. There was a slight issue with my navigation instrument. He got lost. Then one night, I saw the beam from this lighthouse and it guided me to safety. My family's lighthouse, five generations. Yeah. I thought I would never set eyes on her again. It seems the stars had other plans. So you never made it to your destination, huh? No. You regret it? Life with her has been my greatest adventure. Thank you for your time. You're welcome. Well, thank you so much for sharing your story. You know, there are some loves that are destined to be. They just may take a little longer than others. All right. Where to next? Let's figure it out. Thank you, sir. And how long have you been together? Let me show you. Yes, yes. - She's beautiful. - Thank you. You guys. Five years? You ready to see the? So inspiring hearing these people's stories, isn't it? Yes, it is. What are you doing? Well, I think that as the host, it's important that we hear your voice. - Okay. - Chloe. Yes? Your epic love story is still unwritten, right? I mean, I hope so. So how do you think you'll know when you find it? I guess, I guess I'll know when there's nowhere I'd rather be than by their side. Ever met anybody like that? There was someone like that, yeah. But? I don't know, I guess it just didn't work out. We both wanted different things maybe? I think we got it. Yeah. They were so adorable and they've lived in that lighthouse ever since. That is so cute. Sounds like you and Charlie had quite the day. He really came through for me today honestly. It was sweet. So is that a potential love story I need to hear more about? Who? You and Charlie. I don't think there's potential there. Okay, I know that I didn't know you guys back when you were a couple, but seeing you guys together now, it reminds me of when Kenneth and I first started dating. There is something between you two. Well, there definitely was a spark at one point. I just, I don't know about now really. But now that we're all back together here, I mean, it has to have crossed your mind, right? I mean, I don't know if you can see it, but the rest of us can. The thing about Charlie is he'll always pick the next adventure, so it's hard to compete with that. That's hard. I'm gonna go get another cup, do you want one? No, I'm good. That sounds good. Johann, do you want a cup of coffee? Yeah, I'll meet you inside. Okay. Hey, Chloe. How was the nature reserve? Kenneth and Erin had many questions and I had some answers. And Isabella, well, her humor is refreshing. So yeah. You were missed. Thanks. Actually, I'm kinda glad I ran into you. I have to run down to the city hall tomorrow and I was hoping you might join me? With the tour? No, I hoped it would be just the two of us. There's something I would like to discuss with you. Yeah, sure. - Okay. - All right, great. So I'll see you tomorrow then. I'll see you tomorrow. So he asked you to go somewhere? Yeah, last night. - With just the two of you? - I mean, apparently. What? No, no, no, no, nothing, no. I just thought maybe you and Charlie might rekindle something. I don't know. I don't know if I could go down that road again. Well, you're at a crossroads. Who knows where life will take you. Maybe I shouldn't go. This trip was supposed to be about spending time with you guys. Chloe, no, don't worry about us. We'll be fine for a night without your itinerary. Take an evening for yourself. Plus you're kind of taking the tour guide, so it's not like we have a choice. All right, fine, I'll go, because I'm supposed to be having new experiences to get inspired. Exactly. Who wouldn't wanna go out with a tall, cute, kind, funny Icelandic man? Okay, it's not going out. It's not a date. Isn't it? I don't know. Well, who knows? Maybe this will be the start of your very own epic tale of love. Finish it? I saw the beam from this lighthouse. My family's lighthouse for five generations. I thought I would never set eyes on her again. It seems the stars had other plans. It's great. Really, you're not just saying that? No. You're a natural. Well, let's hope my boss shares your same enthusiasm. You have to tell me when it's live because I'm gonna need something to listen to when I'm on my next shoot. Okay, it's sent. How do you feel? Nauseated? I'm proud of you. Thank you. Yeah. You really took a risk and it's awesome. Well, I had a terrible influence, so thank you. You know, you could repay me by giving me a little bit of advice. Yes, what is it? I got an offer for the job in Tokyo. You did, that's awesome. Congrats. Thank you. But the thing is, I'd have to be there the day after tomorrow. I'm thinking about passing. Really? It's been a long time since I've had a vacation and being here with y'all is just, it's allowed me to think about a lot of things. Like? Like my future and what I really want out of my life. And? And you were right. Being on the road can get kind of lonely. So I've been giving some serious thought to that teaching gig in Chicago. Bad idea. No! No, that's, that would be wonderful for you. Really, I'm not crazy? If you are making that decision with your heart, no. It's not crazy at all. Thank you. I feel like I would be. I am thinking about going out into the wilds of Icelandic people watching. Now? I'm gonna take some photos and I was hoping that maybe you would want to join me. I do and I would. But? I made other plans for tonight. Okay. I'll see you later though, right? Yeah, yeah, I'll be back. Thank you again. So this is one of the most beautiful places in all of Reykjavik. You've been very quiet tonight, Chloe. I'm sorry. It's just a lot to take in, I guess. Yeah, I understand. So tell me, college is where you met Isabella and the others? Yeah, And do you love what you're doing? You know, the producing thing? Yes. Well, what about you? Have you always known that this is what you wanted to do? Yeah, it's been our family tradition for many generations, so yeah. And you never wanted to do something different? Why stray away from the well-forged path? Yeah. Although I've been told there's value in taking risks. Repeatedly, actually. Funny that you would say that, because that's actually the reason why I wanted to speak with you tonight. There's a risk that I want to take. What do you think? It's made out of lava rocks and is it tacky? No, no, Johann, it's beautiful, I... What? I'm flattered, but... This isn't for you. It's not? No, it's for Isabella. The day that she stayed after and helped me change the tire was magical and we spent all of yesterday together and honestly she's the most amazing woman that I've ever met. I'm speechless around her. She's pretty great. I knew you were best friends, so I thought maybe you would tell me what she likes? Her interests, and all of it? And in case you thought this wasn't the right gift, and I, yeah, that's why I asked you to come with me tonight. Oh, Johann, that's so sweet. I think she will absolutely love it. - Think so? - Yeah. All right, all right. I feel very silly. Don't, don't. It's obvious that you and Charlie have feelings for one another. I think you should tell him how you feel. Hey, whatcha making? Midnight snack. It's nine o'clock. I'm on Chicago time. Then it's four o'clock. Right. Are we even allowed to be using the kitchen? Well, it's not not allowed, right? You want some? Sure. No onions though. As if I could forget. So how was your night? My night was actually better than expected. What about yours? It was good. Got some great shots. Can I see them? Yeah, of course. I gotta be honest, wasn't the same without you there. Same here. You still have it. Yeah. I've got this habit of getting lost. This, it always helps me find my way back. So did you? Find your way back? It's just my agent. He's been hounding me about that trip, sorry. You know, I'm not that hungry. I'm gonna, I think I'm gonna go to bed. - You don't have to do that. - No, I know. You should call your agent back and, you know, we can talk in the morning. Good night. Whoa there, buddy, take it easy. I think your eyes might be bigger than your stomach. They're for Erin. She loves these. Thought I'd make her laugh and bring her a huge plate. Hey. Question. Yeah? When do you think you knew that Erin was really the one? It's hard to explain. It just kinda hits ya. You realize they're the only thing that makes sense and that couldn't live without 'em. Anybody fit that bill for you, Charlie? Yeah, maybe. Thing is, I don't know if she feels the same way. Charlie, you need to talk to her. You might be surprised. Yeah, you're probably right. Like, now. You are definitely right. Thank you, man. May I? Hey, of course. Good morning. You know, it would be a good morning but they ran out of muffins. I saved you one. That one's yours, I saved it for you. What? I stole it before anyone else saw it. Oh, you're sneaky and sweet, huh? This is fun, isn't it? It is, it's been really nice. There's something that I've been wanting to talk to you about. Yeah, what's going on? I've been thinking a lot. What? You can say it. So it's nearly the end of our wonderful trip together. I can't believe it is. Feels like we just got here. I know, it really does. But I've saved the best for last and tonight we will head into town for dinner and then a surprise. So what are we doing until then? Well, the day is yours. So you were saying? - Chloe. - Yeah? Can we just talk real quick? Yeah, I'll be right back. Sorry. Of course. I love it here. I know, I'm so glad we did this. Yeah. It's amazing. So what did you and Johann do last night? Okay, well, he took me to three places that I can't pronounce, one that I could but I don't remember. That sounds romantic. Isabella, I don't have feelings for him at all. Really? Not like that. Are you sure? I'm sure. And besides, it wasn't a date at all. He actually asked me because he wanted to get my advice on someone else he's interested in. Someone else? Yep. You. Wait, really? It was so sweet. He was so nervous. Wait, he's coming. Okay. Isn't this fire amazing? It's so pretty, I know. Isabella? - Hi. - Can I talk to you for a minute? Of course. Hey, Mark, it's Charlie. Yeah, tell the client that I'm in for Tokyo. Yeah, man, you can put me on that flight tonight. So, I've really enjoyed the last few days. Me too. I hope I'm not being too forward. It's made out of Icelandic lava rocks. Is this an Icelandic tradition I should know about or? No. I saw it and I thought of you. I love it. It's my hope that we will continue to get to know one another, regardless of where we might be in the world. I would like that. I would like that a lot. You're pretty amazing, Isabella. - Hey. - Hey. You going somewhere? I decided to take the job in Tokyo. So you're actually leaving. Yeah, I've gotta catch the red eye. Just like that, before the trip's over? Client's got a deadline and I just, I didn't really have a choice. You do have a choice though. This is my job, Chloe. I just thought that this time was different. I'm sorry. Yeah, me too. All right, to our last night in Iceland. But I am so glad we did this. I know, it's been so fun. Oh, that's. You doing okay, Chloe? Yes. I am fine, why? Well, you know, Charlie, that whole thing... No, no. Charlie did what Charlie does, so you know? I'm sorry, Chloe. It's okay, really, I'm fine. I wish him the best. Let's just enjoy our last night. - Yeah. - Yeah. You're right. Food. Is that Char? You know what? It's Rick. I'm gonna take this, you guys. Oh, yeah, no, no, no. How do you say bread in Icelandic? Well done. I should have taken Icelandic in high school. Hey, Rick, how's it going? Chloe, just checking in on your ETA. Yeah, I'll be back in the office on Monday. Good, 'cause we're gonna need you to come in and shoot some promo shots for Epic Tales of Love. Promo shots? Well, as the host, you will be the face of the show. Wait, you mean? I mean it's yours, Chloe. Thank you. Thank you. Don't thank me, you earned it. With a heck of an audition tape. I teared up listening to it. Okay, well, I'll see you Monday. See you Monday. What? What are you thinking? Just love being here with you. I love you too. We need to do it more. I know, I just feel like we're always so busy. Well, maybe when we get back home, we won't start on things right away. We can take a couple days of staycation. Just the two of us. I like that. No, I really like that. You guys. I got the job! What? I'm hosting. Oh my gosh! Thank you. I'm so glad that I get to share this moment with all of you. I'm so happy, you deserve it. Thank you. And honestly, what a perfect way to end this trip. Yeah. And guys, have you enjoyed Iceland? - Are you kidding? - Yeah, yeah. This has been great. Okay, but guys, we have to promise that we do not let this much time go by before we all get together again, okay? I agree. So what are we doing this summer? I guess I'm canceling all my plans and going on a trip with you guys, obviously. How about the French Riviera? Oh, yes. I've always wanted to go to the Galapagos Islands. Australia! Or we could just, you know, like come back here and see what summer's like in Iceland. And hopefully Charlie will be able to come. Oh, guys, we've got this tradition here in Iceland. Yes, where you write down a wish and then we'll take them to the beach and we'll light them up so they will come true. I love that. And then this will lead us to our final destination of the trip, Diamond Beach. There you go. - All right. - Okay. I guess I'll know when there's nowhere I'd rather be than by their side. And then you just light it on fire. Yeah. Okay. And then you just let it go. - Yeah? - Let it go. - Okay, okay, all right. - There you go. What'd you wish for? I wished that... Wait, don't tell me, it won't come true. Well, if we're lucky, we might see the Northern Lights. Now I see why they call it Diamond Beach. What are you doing here? I wasn't gonna miss this. What happened to Tokyo? I turned it down. Why? Why chase the next adventure when everything I want is right here? So what'd you wish for? I think I just got it. The Northern Lights! Man, it's even more beautiful than I imagined. You know, they say they light up the sky to show you the way. Yeah? I know exactly where my path leads. RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
