And you'll go right through that target. -Target? -Right through... -and into a net, strong net... -Net? And if you go through the net, then you'll land in some hay. I mean, so much hay -you could feed all the cattle in Texas. -What am I worried about? -Nothing! Are you crazy? -I'm so glad you're laughing. He can't miss! He can't miss! I bless you. You will not miss. -J.J., I'm still scared. Yeah. -You're still scared? Well, if you're scared, you could always have him do it. "Him" doesn't come unless there's grave danger to human life. Right... You oughta call "him". Hello, this is Jack smith. We've brought our cameras to record for our 30 million viewers a vintage dive bomber, flying on a simulated attack run, drop a human bomb. A man encased in steel, risking life and limb, hurtling to the ground at 140 miles per hour! Now, this is a man of such great courage that he's destined to become a household name.

In the past, the Cannelloni family was the richest and most powerful family of all the families. We controlled drugs, prostitution, extortion, -prostitution, gambling... -Eh. You said "prostitution" twice. Well, I like it. And now... the Rigatonis, the Tortellinis, the Fettucinis... and even the Raviolis are bigger than we are. And why? High interest rates? -Acid rain? -Japanese imports? None of the above. No... No... No. You I'm not even gonna answer. Gee boss, if I knew there was gonna be a test I... I would have studied. When I passed on the powers of the Don... to my son Don, making him Don Don, I had high hopes for him. And what has he done? He has only brought us disgrace... and shame. Wait a minute...

I'll kill him. -Calm yourself. Don Don, do you have any outstanding markers? -Look in the in-box. -Look in the in-box. 30,000... It's not too outstanding, but it's a start.

I see you got my telegram, Doctor. Was that that yellow thing with the printing on it? -Yes. -I got that, yes. I read that. It's uhm... It was... What does it say? It said I wish to employ your services to take care of my royal ulcer during the Cannonball Run. -Do you know much about ulcers? -[GRUMBLES] Proctology's my specialty. I'm very probably... the world's most famous expert on ulcers. I should probably give you an examination right now. Open up there. I sterilized it. Before we go any further...

I want a girl that's sensitive and vulnerable. I really... I need a girl. -Yeah! Me too. -You? -Sure. Hey J.J., I'm not a eunuch, you know? -Of course you're not a eunuch. Don't put yourself down like that. You have a striking resemblance to a eunuch, but you... I'm just kidding. You want a girl? You can have one of my girls. -I couldn't take one of your girls. -Oh, you can. Well, maybe just one. To clear up my complexion. -So tomorrow... we turn over a new leaf. -Tomorrow. A new leaf. -Up and clean! -Up and clean. And tonight... down and dirty. -Hi J.J! -Hi! Are you guys doing anything tonight? -Not now. -Ah, well. Let's go somewhere and talk about pistons and camshafts. Coming, J.J! Do we still owe Don Don $30,000? -Did you pay him? -No. Well, then we still owe him $30,000! Well, one of his collection men came to collect it. -Wh... wh... where? -He's at the front door, but don't look. I said don't look! If he's at the front door, we'll go out the back door, since he can't be at two places at one time, right? -That's a good suggestion. -Split city. -We're gonna die. -Aye. -What are they gonna do to us? -Don't know what they're gonna do to you, but since Mr. T. ain't here, I'm gonna be too busy lickin' their boots to see! The money, or I'll blow you away! I'll take the money. Listen guys, why would a couple of operators like us be in Redondo Beach with a bunch of hayseeds in jumpsuits? Okay, wise guys. You tell us! We're gonna race to Connecticut and the one that wins -gets $1 million in cash! -Only a moron would back up a race like that. Ahh, Fenderboom, Blake! Good to see you! You should be sleeping at this hour. Remember, we leave at noon tomorrow. Wingtips? Barbarians. Come, come! Buy yourselves a decent clothing store. -Infidels! -That's the moron. You know, these liars could be telling the truth. Hymie Kaplan, what a surprise! Oh wow! You look wonderful! What brings you to the Pinto Ranch? Is it business or pleasure? -May I have a chair? -Oh, certainly. Oh, it's business. I just spoke to Dad, isn't that funny? Don. You don't mind if I call you Don Don, do you? No, no. Oh good, Don Don. When your father was having a little trouble with you in Brooklyn, he called me and asked me for a favor. Could he send you out here to Vegas so that I could watch over yours. So what do I do? I give you a job working at the casino. And what did you do? You spend all your time working on the chorus lines! One line! -I slept with one lousy chorus line! -Shut up! The second favor I do for yours: you come to me -and I lend you the money to start this... -Hymie, -the recession has hurt every small businessman. -Oh yeah. [FINGER-SNAP] -What does he owe? -As of 9:30, the compounded 24% interest weekly brings it to exactly 9 million, 332 thousand, 448 dollars and 55 cents. Hymie, I'm doing the best I can! What?! I'll kill you. That's what's so tragic. I'm gonna do you another big favor. I'll give you exactly until tomorrow to pay everything off. -Well, it's no problem 'cause... -Shut up. Exactly 24 hours, Don Don. I mean, Dumb Dumb. I think I call you Dumb Dumb from now on. What do you think about that, chaps? -It's very funny, boss! -It ain't funny! Now, I'll tell you when somethin' is funny! Mañana, Dumb Dumb. Hymie, one question. Oh my God! What was the question? It'll keep, Hymie. -Are you sure this guy's your uncle? -Yeah, and I told you he's your uncle too. Listen, I told you, don't tell me, don't explain it to me again, please. He's my mother's brother, who moved to California, and my mother is your father's sister, and you're my mother's brother's son. -Is that our uncle? -As... as they said, he had... er... er... a white limo. I ain't seen him in 20 years. He's from your side of the family. Uncle Cal? Howdy, boys! Cal's the name and cars is my game. Got some real sweetheart for little down and 9.9% financing. Uncle Cal, I'm... I'm your nephew... er... Melvin from North Carolina. -You're my brother and sister's boy? -And I'm your nephew Tony from Brooklyn. What pair are you out of? Well, it don't matter. Guess you boys are wandering about my driver? He sure looks a little... er... little... er... little... He... he's weird. Yeah, I mean, is it easy to get a license in this town? Oh, he ain't got no license! Come here. I do all the driving from here. He just sits there and looks like he's driving. It's a publicity gimmick. I got a slogan: "If a monkey can drive, so can you!" I love this boy. He's part of our family. Come on, son. Ain't he cute? Hey look. Hey, Uncle Cal. We got a real real problem. Hey Uncle Cal, we ain't got any money right now. We're flat broke. Yeah, but we need a car right away. -What are you boys doin' out here? -Uncle Cal, we... er... we're Ca... -We're... we're Cannon... -We are Cannonballers. Stop it, boy! I told you not to play with the phones. Damn chimp costs me $300 a month in wrong numbers. Hey, stop it, you primate! That's it! I've had it with you! Excuse me, fellas. I've gotta teach this old boy some manners. Son! Now you've stepped in it! Boys, I got one condition on the deal. I'm gonna give you the limo, but only if you take this hairy son-of-a-bitch with you! -If he's a choreographer, I'm an aviator. -Really? -Same old slop. Let's go to the coffee shop. -Alright. -See you at the matinee? -Yeah. If I have to sing Sound of Music one more time, I'm gonna croak!

Well, sweet. -Sister Betty? That's correct. But we're not partners, we're sisters. Not real sisters. -We're just in the same order together. -So what do you gentlemen do for a living? We race across the country. For money. Oh, and we're gonna have a race today to the East Coast. Are you racing to Broadway? Connecticut. What order did you say you're from? Oh, actually it's just a... a bunch of girls. -Bunch of girls? -We're affiliated together in the Order of... -Immaculate... -Chastity. The Order of Immaculate Chastity.

We have holy work to do. Let's go. Okay. Well, maybe some other time. At what time did you say your race is? -Noon. -At the Portofino Inn, Sister. -Goodbye, Sister veronica. -Come, Sister Betty. -Nice meetin' you, Sister. Bye bye. -Thank you. Come on, hurry Sister Betty, we have lots of lepers waiting. -Don Don? -What is it now? Everything is fine. What we did is, we put our heads together and we're gonna rip off the Arab on the road during the car race. You put your heads together, huh? It must have sounded like a bowling alley! -Yes, Don Don. -We need millions of dollars by... What time is it now? Oh my God! By tomorrow! If we can get the sheik, we got the money. He wants us to rip off the Arab and then kidnap him. -What for? -What for?!! Ransom, you idiots! Ransom. R-A-N-S-U-M! Ransom! -Understand, you imbeciles? -You got it. Please calm yourself. -Tell this to Hymie! -Okay, have a nice day. J.J., is that legal? Both of them? At the same time? J.J., you're bad. Hi Jill, Hi Marcie! Cute car! Imagine the stories J.J.'s making up about last night. -He's driving poor Victor crazy. -Yeah.

You look real sexy! Sexy? -You look... -And I look like a turd. -No, you don't. -J.J., what am I supposed to be? You're a career army man. Forty years in the army, the backbone of the army! -Alright! Man. -Alright. -Wish I had a medal. -You want a medal? Well, I'd like to have a medal. -Take one. -Oh, no. -Take one, you're my friend. -I couldn't take -one of your medals. I couldn't do it. -Take anyone you like. I love you. Okay. -This is a nice one right here. Thanks. -That one. Oh, this is really swell. The Congressional Medal of Honor. Thank you very much! That's really nice. Oh boy... Oh, and it's so shiny. I'm real glad. I love it. -Oh, look, J.J. -Ah. -Good morning. -Good morning. General? Are you a General? General J.J. McClure. Oh, you're a private. -National Guard. -Listen... The Lord asks a favor and we ask a favor of you. We have an emergency in New York and it's very important that we get there. -And we've lost our means of transportation. -And our vows of poverty prevent us from traveling commercially. Could we go along with you? We only have 48 hours to get there, you see. Otherwise... the lepers might cause a panic. -The lepers? -Yes. We treated lepers on Molokai, and now several hundred of them have made their way East to the Big Apple. -We'd like to continue treating them. -Oh... -Oh, sure Sister, this is gonna be swell. -Excuse me. Excuse me. Just one minute. -What? -Come here. -What? -How could you tell 'em "The Big Apple"?! -The lepers? Big Apple? -Well, The Big Apple is New York, J.J. -I know that. -And I didn't even know they had lepers there. Listen to me. -We can't take nuns along. No! -Oh please. What, if we're driving along and I see a pretty girl hitchhiking? She wants to get in the car, a little action? And we got nuns along? -I'm good, but I'm not that good. -Listen, if we take these nuns I bet that God will be our co-pilot. Well... -Why not? -Oh, J.J. -You can come along. -Oh, bless you, my son. -Oh, J.J. You'll get your reward in heaven. -I don't wanna wait that long. -Snappy bags, huh? Ah. Good. -It's purple for Lent. I should tell you something. When we're gonna be in the car, it'll be kind of cramped. -It'll be alright? -Of course. It'll be alright. My Milly took a vow of chastity. She had headaches all the time. Well, well, well... Look who we have here. General Patton... and General Admission. Heckle and Jeckle dressed as cops. Gotta arrest their minds for vagrancy. -Any problems, officers? -Are you kidding, Ladies? I might as well tell you something. We tried it at the last race, dressed like priests. We didn't win. It didn't help us and it ain't gonna help you. Now, as a law enforcement officer I exercise my rights to take these two young ladies and submit them to a very nice long and thorough body search. -VICTOR: Shame on you! -Listen. These are real nuns. This is not a Halloween party. Have a little respect. I'm up to here with you. You're sick. Gather around, look this way. Fenderboom, Blake, J.J., victor...

Let me tell you what to do, son. Buckle up. You're taking part in your first high-speed pursuit and capture! It's following us. The police car's following us. Probably recognized me. [CRIES] -What? -I mean, it's not my life style. -I don't... -No, you're fine. -You're shaking. I'll hold your hand. -Oh, thank you, thank you. -Oh, they're so warm. -J.J. is the warmest! -Sister Betty, he has such warm skin! -He has such warm skin? You should feel the heater up here. Noticed how I took that last curve? High and wide, straight through the apex. Pick up about 15 mph more coming out. -What are you writin'? -The accident report. Damn! -Tony, are you sure about this? -Stop complaining! -Statistics proof flying is safer than driving. -Is that right? Sideward and rearward maneuvering is accomplished by... oh, am I mad at you! You told me you could fly this thing. We almost got killed three times already! Will you shut up an read the instructions?! Or we'll be killed for the last time! You're getting me crazy. This thing can not fly by itself! -We're leveling out! -Alright, so we didn't crash. Now, explain to me about the magnet on the helicopter. Why? -This scheme is too complicated for me. -The alphabet is too complicated for you! It's simple: this magnet is powerful enough to pick a Brinks truck right off the street. Oh, a Brinks truck, huh? -Here's your sandwich, Your Highness. -You'd better not, Your Royalship. That salami will kick the shit out of your ulcer! -Wait, wait. There's the Rolls! -Ha! Good. -This flyin' is a piece of cake! -Now that we found 'em, what do we do? Are you kidding? I just sneak up behind 'em. They probably won't even know I'm there. Then, at the right second: zappo! We snatch 'em. Oh! Smart! Why did I ever doubt you Tony? I'm too dumb to question smart people. This is true. -Tony, don't you think you're too low? -That's a negative. -It looks a little low, Tony. -I can see it through the window, okay? A little bit to the left. -A little more to the left. -How did you get here? The Tooth Fairy? -I flew you here, shmuck! -Now, down a little. Hit the button on the magnet! [THUMP] I love being a gangster! We're on like glue. Nothing, nothing could separate us now. Nothing! -Up, up and away! -Up, up and away. Listen! Up, up and awaaay... -I don't know why it ain't workin'. -Could be the fan belt. Maybe it don't work on nothin' but Brinks trucks. Don't worry about it. I'll have it all figured out in a second. Tony, is your seat belt on? [CRASH] Hep. Eatin' time! You feed him, and... I'll drive. No, no, no. It's your turn. You feed him. Come on! Here you go. Oh... Son-of-a-bitch! That son-of-a-bitch is crazy! He's got a mental case... ♪ Ohhhhh ♪ ♪ Oh, it's hard to be a genius, of course ♪ ♪ But keep that old horse ♪ ♪ Before the cart ♪ ♪ First you gotta have heart... ♪ -Corporal. You're driving well. -Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Sister Betty? You know, I was raised a Catholic and I'm really interested. Could you tell us more about the Order of the Immaculate Charity? -Chastity. -Chastity! He always get those words mixed up. Well... I think it's time for us to get some sleep. -Oh sure. Good. -So if you just excuse us, -we'd like to have a little privacy. -Sure. Go ahead, there's... Just put that... -Good night. -Good night. Hey, am I crazy? Or are those the friendliest nuns you've ever seen? -Isn't Sister Betty cute? -Ahh. I'd... I'd like to jump her bones. -J.J., bite your tongue! -Can't help it. I'm sorry. Aren't you ashamed? -I would! -Oh my goodness! Why would you say such a... -That's sacrilegious! -These are human beings. And I'd be very interested to know how you make out. Huh? 'Cause I been thinking about getting into Sister Betty's pants. Oh God, forgive me... Morning officer! Nice day, isn't it? Get out of the road, fat boy, before you get run over. -Come on. -Okay. -Good morning! -Goddamn! A General! -Now, what seems to be the problem, officer? -We have speed limits in this here state. -Even in a nuclear emergency? -What emergency? We can't talk about it, officer. -Let me see your driver's license. -No! I have radioactive breath. -What are you boys trying to pull? -There has been a nuclear meltdown. We're taking some contaminated material to Connecticut. Why Connecticut? They ran out. Bullshit! -Hey, uncle Hinky! -Homer! My nephew. -We'll wait for you, Homer. -Thanks, Sir. How you're doin', Homer? -Goddamn, I didn't know you was coming home! -Private! Yes sir, General! -What are you doing here, son? -Well, I had a 3-day pass to come home. It's the first one I had in two years. I'm gonna commandeer you to drive this car to Connecticut. -Get in the car, son. -Yes, Sir! Hold it! Ain't nobody goin' no place till I phoned this here in! Uncle Hinky, I gotta do what he says. He got more medals than all at the base together. It don't make no difference. I phone it in anyway. -Good morning, officer. -Sweet Jesus! -General, why are we stopping? -I'm sorry, Sister. I was just explaining to the sheriff the purpose of my mission. -You carry nuns with you? -In case we don't... -make it, you know? -Oh, really? There's a higher purpose involved, officer. Only the Lord knows what it is. The safety of our nation depends on the speed of our mission. Wow! Praise the Lord! Well, in that case I'll give you a police escort all the way to the county line. -Bless you. -Sheriff... I just want you to know something: America needs your help! There are two communists disguised as policemen chasing us in a red Corvette. -Commies! -No shit? No shit. Now, don't go arguing with me! I've got it straight from the General! There are two communists dressed up as policemen in a red Corvette... trying to steal our nuclear shit! Shoot 'em! The fate of the country depends on it, do you hear me? [OVER RADIO] Headquarters, this is units 2 and 5 eastbound on Highway 10. -We got those commies in our sights. -Commies? Now, I been called a lot of things but I ain't never been called no commie. I ain't even a Democrat. [OVER RADIO] But you can inform the General they're as good as caught. The General... General!? J.J! That son-of-a-bitch! Good, Blake. But not good enough! [OVER RADIO] This is 2 and 5 again. We're now westbound on Highway 10. [OVER RADIO] This is the Captain. I want those two foreigners brought in. -Dead or alive. -Don't you worry about it. You know what I'm gonna do? -What? -I'm gonna turn this car around and I am gonna block the whole highway sideways. And when they come they have a choice: either to ditch it or ram right straight into us! -Just ditch it or... ram straight into us? -Yeah! Get outta here with these bananas! I don't want the bananas! This is humiliating as hell... er... sittin' up here! Well, it's no picnic being back here! Wacked-out monkey! [CRASH] Stop it! Well, keep your hands off me, monkey! What are you doing up here? -Man, it's safer. -[CRASH] -Well, who's drivin'? -He is. Would you boys like to stay for dinner? I just made noodle soup. Note, Blake. General Patton's car. Is the blimp driving? No. It's the General. The General, huh? Ha! Oh, I'm gonna make a private out of him! It's money in the bank. A million bucks! Oh, come on! It'll be a weekend you'll never forget. -All three of us? -Yep. It's gonna be a weekend you can tell your kids about... if they're all boys. Look, you guys thrashed this gull-wing out. I didn't even pay for that one yet. Listen, baby. We're gonna be as gentle with that car as we're gonna be with you. Real sound. Come on, what you say? -Okay. Okay. -Alright. The keys are in the car, but hurry back. My friends aren't gonna believe this! -Know what? You just bring them too. -Really? Sure. And don't forget your camera. Really? -You got a full tank of gas in here? -Please, be careful with it. Please! (I'll be real gentle) What do you want, Ching-Chong man? [SPEAKING CHINESE] Help? Gee, there's only a dozen of 'em. By the way, can you split that for me? Thank you. I'll be there in a minute! [SPEAKING CHINESE] That was wonderful. You're great. Can you stay for dinner and meet my parents? That was so great! What's your name? Hey, we got a race to finish. A million bucks! [SPEAKING CHINESE] He can stay for dinner, too! Dammit! The race is gonna be over, if they don't get their buns out here soon. Golly! They changed their clothes. -You think we've gone too far? -Probably. Let's go for it. You know, General? I bet this mission is so secret you had 'em do this so Russian spies wouldn't recognize 'em. We got a six-pack and some chilli-dogs for the trip. I got one for you and one for... "him". You've adapted to civilian life very well. Oh my God! Private... Walk this way. Nuns, huh? -Get in the car. -Yes, General. Put that away! You ain't gonna use it! To your right, Highness. To your right. As soon as this cable rips up the Rolls... -you grab the money... -I grab the money? And I grab the sheik or what's left of 'em... -and we head back to Vegas. -Vegas?! [CAR PHONE CHIMES] Prince Falafel! Buy what? Nimitz? What's a Nimitz? The U.S.S. Nimitz, ah! I want to buy it! I want to land my 747s on it! I don't care what it costs. How much? -Feelin' better now, aren't you? -I can't hear you! Talk louder! -I said, you're feeling better now, aren't you?! -Yes, a thousand thanks! -No problem! Buy! -Bye. -Tighten it up, they're coming! Tighter! -I tighten it! Come. Hurry. Here it comes! -Well yeah, you get what you pay for. -Oh, dammit! -What now? -I don't know! -Well, get out and start smiling. -Yeah, right. Don't blame me! I didn't do nothin'! Me neither. I'm just followin' orders. We were turning about 8 grand when the gages lit up like a pinball machine. Yeah, so we propped the hood and there's oil leaking. -Right here. -Mm-hmm. -Does it look bad? -Not from where I'm standing. -Oh, can you fix it then? -Honey, I got a tool that'll fix anything! Oh, yeah? -Hey, sugar? -Yeah? What have you got under the hood? Alright. That's a 454, four on the floor. -Full house, with a blower. -Yeah? She's a sweetheart, isn't she? It sure is hot out here, ain't it? Yeah, it really is. Why don't you relax, sugar? Everything's gonna be just fine! I don't think my boss wanted this to do 120 mph. -Well, it's doin' it! -Come on, listen. Why don't you just take me back and... My... Just take me back to my boss... Oh jeez, am I gonna get it! What the heck! It's only a job. Let's go! And it's gonna be a weekend you'll never forget. [SIREN] COMPUTER: Attention... Smokie in pursuit. Attention... Smokie in...

Pay attention! -We've been coming here for five years! -Five years! -Without a fish. -A big one's out there for you, boys. -You're sure? Darn right! I saw him jump the other day. I took a picture, while it was in the air. Picture weighed 13 and a half pounds! I really don't like this guy! [SPEAKING CHINESE] Forward all engines. Come on, just pay attention to what you're doing. All ahead full. -Let him go! -No! We've caught ourselves a Moby Dick! God damn, we're going with him! -And you haven't seen your family in 2 years? -No, but I'm not complaining. Duty calls. -General? -What? How long do you think the national emergency will require the services of Pvt. Lyle here, Sir? -I don't know. -He hasn't seen his family in 2 years. J.J., that is not nice. Truly isn't. A General's work is never done. -Private. -Yes, Sir. I've checked the Geiger counter and the radioactivity seems to be dropping. I don't think we need your services anymore. -Yes, sir. Yes, sir. -Pull over. Pvt. Lyle, you've rendered a great service to this country. You make me proud to be in the same army with a man with your character. I'd like to present you with the Congressional Medal of Honor. -This Congressional Medal of Honor? -That Congressional Medal of Honor. -That's French. -I know. General, for the last 20 years while I was working in the motor pool I always knew the Good Lord's gonna give me a chance to come on a special mission like this, to serve my country.

I was eating my dessert when suddenly I saw one of the cat people. -Beautiful body was... -Now, we have a slight problem. Two hoods. They parted with the Sheik and the money. How that happen? She was hitchhiking in a leopard coat and as we approached -she flashed and we stopped. -[SPEAKING CHINESE] He's right. Who else knew the million was in the sheik's trunk? I think you two guys have got something to tell us. -Right? -Right. J.J, let me explain to you as briefly as I can. Here's what happened. We owed the guys in Vegas a little chump change. Nothing really. So they sent down some torpedoes to collect. -And you told 'em about the Sheik. -It was tell 'em or else. -Who were these guys? -The Cannelloni family from Las Vegas. -Well, hell. Let's just go get these guys. -We can't just go get these guys! -Why? -They hold up at the Pinto Ranch. And that's guarded like Fort Knox. Wait a minute. Maybe "him" can get through. Maybe "him" can get "himself" killed and take you with "him". -"Him" is open for other suggestions. -What's happening? What's going on here?

Oh, girls. How do you spell Laverne? Is that one word or two? -Two. -Three. Oh, Hymie, what a pleasant surprise! Uh, what a pleasant surprise... Hey! I said I'd be here in 24 hours. Therefore... it ain't no surprise. And it ain't gonna be pleasant either. May I? Oh my God... -What are these three bow-wows? -It's our new lounge act. What do they do? Scare the audience to death? ...That's funny! Mr. Hymie? You girls ever hear of Nair? -We're working on it. -Huh? Our doctor has us on hormones. Well, I suggest you go for a second opinion, because I think he's over-prescribing. Hi, I'm Laverne. [CRUNCH] Get me those hormones. Alright, Dumb-Dumb. Where's my nine large?

You know, something that you would go over the coals with? I'll have some quiche. And a little chocolate mousse. Er, Shish kebab... No, no. Couscous. Friggin' chickasee? Chicken fricasse... -And you? -I'd like a wine list. Where I'm sending you, baby, everything's on the menu. We're saved! Hey, reminds me of Brooklyn! Hi there! Surprise! You too!

Salute! -Hello, Chaos! -Look J.J., a flower! Nice, huh? See ya! And I figured that 30,000 we owe you... This will more than take care of it. -May I buy you a drink? Cherie! -Yes. Cherie!? I guess everyone... They seem to be so busy! That was fun, J.J! -Get those guys! -You got it. Fly, baby! Fly! Help is on the way! Justice will triumph! Sorry, bad guys! Carry on. Raining like a son-of-a-bitch over there. -You need any help here? -Yes. Inject that. Fine. Oh, the plague! I've seen this before... No, Jackie! J.J... Cannonball...

To share in my good fortune with my fellow Cannonballers I have decided to raise the prize money to two million dollars! -How many zeros is in that? -I don't know! We'll split it three ways? -Yeah! -Come, my sweethearts, we go! Hey, Fenderbaum, Blake! Come here a minute! What is it, Frank? Can't you see we're busy? I know that.

Better go in the bar and get gassed up, 'cause you're racing back tomorrow... -at noon! -Park it. I'll see you in the bar. Thanks. We'll leave tomorrow and we'll be back in four days. Then Atlantic City and a weekend you'll never forget. Once again you have brought shame and disgrace to our tribe -by not winning the Cannonball Run. -But Pop, there was this doctor in the car. -He gave me a... It was kismet. -I warn you! Tomorrow's race is the last Cannonball I am financing. If you do not win, do not bother to come home. Pop, don't worry. I can't lose! I have hired the winner of this Cannonball to be my co-driver in the next one. I'd like you to meet him. I have told him so much about you, Pop. Excuse me, Sir. I'd like you to meet my Pop! The Cannonball is a race from California to Connecticut. We have lots of fun. And then... The Sheik... What they... I can get this. Just a minute. I can do it. Wait a minute. -And... From the slap? -We'll start from the slap. Sir! Er... Just pick it up right from the slap. Sir! Sorry, we get this in a minute. It's alright. We get it. Here we go. Oh, Sir! The Cannonball is a race from Connecticut to your ass. Now, if your mother could kiss like that... We're just gonna place it. Ready? Huh? Is that what you want? You got it. -You got it. -I don't trust you. No, you got it, I swear. I'm just gonna place it. Oh shit, if I wasn't getting a lot of money... -Don't get it from the ground. -Where might I gonna get it from? Get it from here. This is fresh. -There'll be a mound here. -I got fresh stuff here. Nobody's ever peed on this. I'm just gonna place it. How animals live on this shit? Listen, if we have these nuns God will be our co-pilot. I don't care. You listen to me. Listen to me. We're not taking those nuns along. What is the matter with you? I can't work like this! -She's winking at me. -Hold there. She's to wave. -Alright. Okay. -I have no protection. -She is... Godammit... -Pick it up. -Lepers? New York? -No: "Lepers? Big Apple?" I order you... -J.J! Long time no see. -Captain Chaos, nice to see you again. Would you do it again? -Yeah, certainly. -Here we go. Keep it rollin'. Here we go. -J.J! -Captain Chaos! -Long time no see. -Good to see you again. -Good to see you! -Listen... I'd deem it a personal pruverage... privilege, if I can get in that bomb and get my teeth fixed. Turn around, let's start again. -J.J! -Captain Chaos. -Long time no see. -Good to see you again. I'd deem it a privilege you let me ride in the bomb. Did you understand that at all? Just turn around and let me do it again. Listen, isn't somebody gonna say "Cut"?
