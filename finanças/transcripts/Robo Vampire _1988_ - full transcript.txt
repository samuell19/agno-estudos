(suspenseful music) Over there, move! Mm! (metallic creaking) Hey! Ahh! (frightened grunting) (gun firing) (snake hissing) (frightened grunting) (whooshing) (gun firing) (gasping) (screaming) (groaning) (gun firing) (groaning) (gun firing) (grunting and groaning) (strangled screaming) (roaring) (roaring) (gun firing) (groaning) (screaming) (groaning) (screaming) (dramatic music) (motors roaring) (waves splashing) (energetic music) Don't move! Hey, let's go! Come on, run! Stay back! (gun firing) (yelling) Oh, fuck. (motor roaring) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) Listen, we must find a way handle Tom, that god damn anti-drug agent! Boss, what are your plans then? I've employed a Daoist. He'll train vampires to deal with him. Contact headquarters, Richard, and ask Young to find a new way to smuggle the heroin in. Meanwhile, I'll send Tony and Ken over to watch the Daoist vampires. - Right. - Right. (suspenseful music) (grunting) Excuse me, it wasn't my idea, it was Boss Cole's! If we work together, we could make a lot of money and I'd build a new altar for you! Here, you must be hungry, here, eat! (yelling) (dish smashing) Ken, what the hell are you doing here? I hope you haven't come to check up on me now, have ya? (laughing) You didn't have to scare me! You scare too easy! Now come and help me, come on. - You. - After. You finish up here. (suspenseful music) (mystic whooshing) (mystic whooshing) (heavy breathing) That's everything. (laughs) Again. Please, bless our drugs. Thank you, vampires, thank you very much, thank you. Hey, Ken, if you want a cigarette, just ask me for one! We're friends aren't we? Come on, what do you think I am? Hey, want one of these? - No, thanks. - Come on, they're good! Take one! No! Suit yourself. They stole again! Ken? Hey, be careful! You start a fire, the vampires will wake up! Yeah, sure, Tony. (pained groaning) (frightened gasping) (mystic whooshing) (screaming) (smashing and thudding) (roaring) (growling) (grunting) (grunting) (thudding) (mystic whooshing) (mystic whooshing) (yelling) (thudding and crashing) (frightened groaning) (roaring) (grunting and thudding) (grunting and thudding) (grunting and thudding) (grunting and thudding) (monstrous screaming) (monstrous yelling) (grunting and thudding) (grunting and thudding) (monstrous screaming) (monstrous wailing) (rapid banging) (monstrous wailing) (grunting and thudding) (roaring) Enough! They woke up! Thanks for your help! Let me take a look at those drugs. I was just putting them inside. This is rice powder, that's why they woke up. Really? Inform Boss Cole! You two will be punished for this. - Yes! - Come on. (suspenseful music) Wait here now. I'm sorry to bother you! Is everything all right? Cole, it's okay! Everything's under control! No need to worry! Okay, come on down! (engine roaring) - You keep your eyes peeled. - Right! - You stay here. - Okay. We're changing our cover from the drug smuggling business. To what? A slight variation, you know, on the body smuggling business. Bodies? I guess you're still the boss. Let's go. (tense music) (laughing) (crickets chirping) (wind howling) (atmospheric music) Well, open it up then. The drugs. Here. (whooshing) I've completed the vampire project. Come and witness his incredible power for yourselves now. Are you sure that even machine guns don't cause no harm to him? Come on, show us this vampire. You must be very quiet. Don't be scared by his power or he will attack you. (chuckling) These will help protect you from the vampire's power. And take these as an extra precaution. (chuckling) You're his creator, can't you manipulate him? Of course I can control him, but you can't. So that's why you need protection. Take them. (dramatic music) (intense mystic whooshing) (whooshing) (grunting) (intense mystic whooshing) (loud banging) (mystic whooshing) (whooshing) How can that be a lady ghost? How dare you enter here, you witch! How dare you take my lover's corpse towers, Daoist, and turn him into a vampire beast? Now he is condemned to a living death and we can never be together in the afterlife! But he is from the East and you the West! How can you explain? Orientals are a stubborn race and both his parents opposed our marriage. It was then that we decided, if we could not be together in this life, Peter and I would be together forever in the afterlife! You have robbed us of this by turning him into a vampire beast! Now my only thought is of revenge. Now my dreams have been shattered! I hold you responsible for my misery! (whooshing) (banging) (gasping) (grunting) (grunting) (gasping) (mystic whooshing) (grunting) (gasping) (laughing) May the devil protect me and help me beat this witch. May the devil protect me and help me beat this witch. May the devil protect me and help me beat this witch. (whooshing) Vampire now awake and help me! (roaring) Awake and help me! Peter, don't you recognize me? I'm Christine! Go and kill her! (mystic whooshing) (roaring) Peter, I'll still love you forever! (mystic whooshing) (roaring) (grunting) (gasping) (roaring) (mystic whooshing) (gasping) (roaring) (grunting) (gasping) (mystic whooshing) (intense mystic whooshing) Peter, you finally recognize me! She's your enemy! Daoist, that lady ghost loves him deeply. Let's fulfill her wish. Besides, both of them will be under our council once they're married, right? A marriage, the vampire and the ghost? With your magical powers, I'm sure you can make it. (heavy breathing) I beg you, please make it happen. All right but, from now on, you must both obey me. (growling) Right, then I will make the preparations for your wedding ceremony. (atmospheric music) Cole and Young have adopted some tricky methods again. More cunning. Luckily, we've got our agents Sophie and Brown watching them very closely. I'm worried about them. We should get rid of these drug smugglers. Sophie tells me there's a deal going down. I'm gonna try and arrest them. (engine roaring) Hold it! Let's go! (guns firing) (grunting) Stop them! (guns firing) (guns firing) Cover me! (guns firing) (groaning) (gun firing) (gun firing) (yelling) (gun firing) (yelling) (mystic whooshing) (gun firing) (growling) (mystic whooshing) (screaming) (grunting) (thudding) (gun firing) (strangled yelling) (crackling) (yelling) (loud banging) (engine roaring) (electronic beeping and whirring) (tense music) So how's Tom? It was a fatal wound, he's dead. Since Tom's dead, I want to make use of his body to create an android-like robot, Mr. Glenn. I would appreciate your approving my application. - Are you assured of success? - Mhmm. All right, your application's approved. May I remind you of one point? You must proceed with your invention with great care and in strict confidence. All right? Yes, all right. (clanging) (beeping) (buzzing) (beeping) (beeping) (beeping) (electronic whirring) (sinister music) (yelling) (electronic whirring) (growling) (gun firing) Impossible. There must be some traitors on Bill's side, yes? Our latest drug deal was strictly confidential but that damn cop, Tom, busted us. I agree with you. And now you should inform Mr. Young that, in my opinion, all anti-drug agents should be terminated at once! Yeah. Hmm. (engine roaring) - Where's the priest's house? - Oh, down there! (suspenseful music) Father, where are the drugs? You ask about drugs? I know nothing about drugs. Oh, really? My informants don't lie so tell me where they are! See for yourself, this is a house of God. Why would there be drugs here, I ask. If you don't start telling the truth, not even your God will be able to save you! I tell you the truth! I know nothing about drugs. We'll see about that! (grunting) (yelling) Hey, the drugs! You lying priest, for this you die! No! (guns firing) (yelling) Hey, kill the priest, quick! (gun firing) (yelling) (gun firing) (yelling) Father! (gun firing) (gun firing) (yelling) (gun firing) (yelling) (gun clicking) Shoot me! (tense music) You're nothing but scum! You killed Father Brown and you drug kill million! (laughs) Anyone who gets in our way is removed. And as for our flourishing drugs business, all we do is supply an ever-increasing western demand. As you're no doubt aware, being a narcotics agent. But your death will not be so easy as our good friend Father Brown! For you, we have something special! You bastard, we'll never give up 'til we get you! (laughing) You, get out of here. But you said I could have her now. Oh, I think that first you and I should have a little fun together. (laughs) (yelling) (laughing) I like a woman with spirit! (laughs) (gasping) (yelling) (yelling) (laughing) - How's the experiment going? - Very close to success. Bad news, Brown's dead and Sophie's been captured. If your experiment is successful, assign him a mission. I'll get back to you very soon, thanks. Chief Thompson, Sophie has been captured and imprisoned by Young's men. We must get her out at all costs. We're finished if she talks. You choose an appropriate man for the task. Make sure he won't fail. (dramatic music) Ray, we need your help to rescue this woman. She's a narcotics agent, captured by Young. Then she's in a lot of trouble if that scumbag's got her. Any idea where they're holding her? At Young's main HQ, smack in the middle of the Golden Triangle. If she talks then all of us are washed up. So what do you say? What's it worth to me? Well, I'd pay a million but it's not up to me. The governor will pay you $20,000. I'm gonna need three more men and lots of ammunition. $30,000. Right, okay. Right, you two, come with me, come on. (suspenseful music) Don't move, stop! Drop your weapons! Come with me. (waves splashing) Where are you going? Well, we're just on our way to that factory there. Show me your I.D. (mystic whooshing) (frightened yelling) (guns firing) (mystic whooshing) (screaming) (banging) (pained yelling) (metallic thudding) (roaring) (robotic grunting) (gun firing) Come on! (gun firing) (metallic thudding) (electronic whirring) (electronic whirring) Robo Warrior calling headquarters. Soldier is severely wounded off of Highway 309, send helicopter at once. (electronic whirring) (water gurgling) (energetic music) Open fire! (guns firing) (yelling) What do we do? (guns firing) You're surrounded, now give yourself up! They knew we were coming. I think you're right. (guns firing) (yelling) (guns firing) (yelling) Retreat! (motor roaring) (gun firing) (loud banging) Hey, you three, you'd better surrender or I promise you'll end up like that boat! (laughing) Hey, Andy, what took you so long! (dramatic music) (moaning) Turn it off! Turn off the water! Turn it off! Hey, this is only the beginning. It gets much worse than this. Soon you'll beg us to finish you off. But we'll catch a few more agents before that happens. Unless you wanna give us the information right now. No, no, I won't tell you anything, no! No, no! Hmm, so this is her. Mm, pretty. Or at least she was. I guess she'll be in a bad state by the time we get to her. If Young hasn't killed her by then. The reason that I asked for your help in this mission is because you're familiar with the area near Young's HQ. And I know that you also have a score to settle with Young. Isn't that true? And also with this man with the tattooed hand. (engine roaring) (crowd murmuring) Hey, looks like Bill's over there. Yeah, you're right! Having a bit of an arm wrestling contest! (laughing) (crowd applauding and cheering) (groaning) (tense music) The tattoo in the photograph! Hey, you come with me! Come on! Hey, go and see what's happening. (grunting) (crowd agitatedly chattering) (grunting) (grunting) Now you're gonna tell me where Sophie is or I'm gonna kill you, do you understand? Start talking or say your prayers! Yeah. Okay now, kill them all, fire! (guns firing) (crowd screaming) (gun firing) Down! (guns firing) All right, let's get out of here fast, move it! (engine roaring) Is this one of the guys we're after? That's right, this is our friend in the photo with the tattoos. And now we've got him, let's get him ready and move out of here, okay? Right. (water splashing) (atmospheric music) I'm tired, I need to rest. Okay. Listen, you'd better tell me where they're holding Sophie. (laughing) Talk or else! I don't know where they're holding Sophie, I don't. Young didn't tell me. (grunting) (heavy breathing) Now don't give me any of that shit or you're gonna die right here. (grunting) Now talk or I'll kill ya! (grunting) Now tell me where they're holding Sophie! Knock it off, Ray! (grunting) If you go and kill him now, we're never gonna find out whereabouts they're holding Sophie prisoner! Who are you? I'm Wendy, Andy's younger sister. (gun firing) (gasping) (grunting) You dumb son of a bitch! Ray, no! Hey, I don't think he's gonna live long. We'll see about that. Well, I intend to make sure! How about this? Just give me five minutes. This one would die before he told us anything. Thanks for your help, guys. This guy would have made a mess of me. It's my pleasure, buddy. Listen, do you really think that your boss is gonna believe you didn't cooperate? (metallic thudding) (electronic whirring) (atmospheric music) (suspenseful music) (fire roaring) Yeah, (laughs) we did it! (laughing) Well, this is it, all right? (electronic whirring) (metallic thudding) (mystic whooshing) (energetic music) (gun firing) (grunting) (whooshing) (gun firing) (gun firing) (roaring) (grunting) Okay, come on, get ready, go on! (electronic whirring) Fire! (loud banging) Emergency, save the robot at once! (beeping) (suspenseful music) I'm afraid he short-circuited. Not that serious. (electric crackling) (whirring) (beeping) How's he now? (electronic whirring) (beeping) (electronic whirring) (engine roaring) (grunting) Oh yeah, look at this here. Ah boys, come on. All right. (laughing) (smashing) Give me that! Who are you? We're two of the meanest fuckers around, that's who. - You think so, do you? - Yeah! (grunting) (smashing) (grunting) (grunting) (grunting) Okay, kill them! Hey, let's get out of here! (guns firing) (pained yelling) (gun firing) (screaming) Okay, let's go! Hey! Fire from here! (guns firing) (engine roaring) Hey, you two okay? You hurt? Well, just my pride and my lip. - Yeah, we're okay. - Let's get out of here before they decide to come back, okay? (tense music) My God. Why? We must avenge the loss of these innocent lives. There's not much further to go now. Soon we can take our revenge. Come on, follow me, let's go. (metal clanking) Better keep moving. Well, I sure don't wanna stay around here. He's right, Young will have men out looking for us. Let's keep going. Come on. What are you gonna do with the kid? He could be working for Young. You know there's no way you can be sure. Am I right? Maybe. If we're all finished sightseeing, we should make a move now. (gun firing) (gasping) My God, so bloody cool, aren't you, Andy? Wait, come back here, come back! (dramatic music) Sorry, just hadn't seen. Young doesn't give a damn about human life. Okay, come on, let's go and get moving, huh? (water splashing) (gasping) Oh, Ray! (laughs) It's a great view! You should bathe more often. You bastard, don't you have any manners? Just go away. (laughing) (water splashing) (laughing) (giggling) (moaning) (laughing) (tense music) (grunting) (mystic whooshing) (grunting) (whooshing) (whooshing) (banging) (whooshing) (banging) (whooshing) (mystic whooshing) (whooshing) (heavy breathing) (laughing) (atmospheric music) (mystic whooshing) (heavy breathing) (mystic whooshing) (suspenseful music) (metallic thudding) (mystic whooshing) (moaning) Don't kill us, we love each other! You can kill us but wait 'til our love's consummated. Hmm. (romantic music) (laughing) What's the matter, honey? Tell me. Leave me alone! You don't have to be so temperamental. As long as you're a cop, I don't want to see you again. But you knew I was a cop when we got married. I didn't know what was involved at first or that it would be so dangerous! I've worked this job for years and I'm still alive! (mystic whooshing) (crickets chirping) (electronic whirring) (metallic thudding) (mystic whooshing) (mystic whooshing) (mystic whooshing) (roaring) (monstrous wailing) (mystic whooshing) (mystic whooshing) (grunting) (growling) (gun firing) (mystic whooshing) (banging) (gasping) (mystic whooshing) (mystic whooshing) (thudding) (energetic music) Come on! Fire! (guns firing) (gun firing) (yelling) Come on, let's go! Hey! (gun firing) Hey, hey, what are you doing? You can't take this from me! Ray! Ray! (grunting) Quick, jump, quick! Fire! Jump! (gun firing) (loud banging) (water splashing) (gasping) (gasping) (laughing) (suspenseful music) (laughing) Let me tell you that nobody ever escapes from me. Now Sophie's got company. (laughs) I want Ray. Ray! (slurred murmuring) What do you think you're doing? I asked you a question! No one's allowed near the prisoners! Or maybe you wanna join them? Now go! Keep moving! Quick! (tense music) Well, there are dozens of guards, it won't be easy. (atmospheric music) (sinister music) (moaning) (moaning) Who are you? Shh! (atmospheric music) It's okay, I've come to help you! Thanks! Thank you. You'll be okay. Oh God! Oh no! You must pretend to be tied up! (laughing) Hey, the water stopped! (grunting) (yelling) (grunting) (yelling) (laughing) (grunting) (grunting) (yelling) (screaming) Quick. (grunting) (yelling) (gun fires) (yelling) Now they know we're here so let's be careful! (gun firing) If we can get closer, I can use this baby here. (gun firing) (gun firing) (gun firing) (guns firing) (yelling) (loud banging) Come on! Why have we stopped? Let's keep moving! No, come back! (gun firing) (yelling) Ted's gone! Leave it to me, I'll fix 'em. No, it's my turn! (yelling) (gun firing) (loud banging) (yelling) (laughing) (grunting) (guns firing) (yelling) I'll cover you. (gun firing) Take this rifle, open fire. (gun firing) (yelling) (guns firing) (yelling) (guns firing) (guns firing) (guns firing) (guns firing) (yelling) (guns firing) (yelling) (moaning) Come here! Look after her! (grunting) (screaming) (gun firing) (yelling) Hey Zack, are you okay? - Sure I am! - Come on! Round up the straggles, okay? (sighing) Get moving, go on, get those hands up. Look out! (growling) (tense music) (gun firing) (yelling) Let's go! (energetic music) (loud banging) (suspenseful music) Damn it, Ray's team have destroyed Young and his headquarters! We must rebuild my empire! Daoist, will you help me? Certainly, I'll help you to restore your status again. But first we must get rid of that robo-warrior! (metallic thudding) (gun firing) (yelling) Drop your weapons in 15 seconds! (whooshing) 15, 14, 13, 12, 11. (grunting) (gun firing) (crackling) (mystic whooshing) (gun firing) (yelling) (roaring) (grunting) (thudding) (growling) (grunting) (monstrous wailing) (grunting) (growling) (roaring) (grunting) (thudding) Well? Yeah, I really like this place. The lights and everything, it's great. (moaning) (screaming) (growling) (metallic thudding) (electronic whirring) So what do you say we find somewhere quiet to be alone then? Don't blow me away by saying you don't love me anymore. Well? Does this mean you don't love me anymore? (mystic whooshing) (metallic thudding) (grunting) (growling) (group chattering) (screaming) (growling) (metallic thudding) (roaring) (metallic thudding) (roaring) (metallic thudding) (roaring) (electronic whirring) (growling) (screaming) (electronic whirring) (growling) (screaming) (gun firing) (mystic whooshing) (growling) (metallic thudding) (whooshing) (loud banging) (loud banging) (gun firing) (gun firing) (loud banging) (growling) (electronic whirring) (grunting) (thudding) (grunting) (thudding) (growling) (monstrous gurgling) (grunting) (thudding) (crashing) (grunting) (thudding) (metallic thudding) (energetic music) (electronic whirring) (gun firing) (gun firing) (yelling) (gun firing) (gun firing) (yelling) (mystic whooshing) (mystic whooshing) (grunting) (grunting) (thudding) (mystic whooshing) (laughing) (crackling) (mystic whooshing) (grunting) (grunting) (thudding) (mystic whooshing) (grunting) (laughing) (grunting) (crackling) (grunting) (mystic whooshing) (grunting) (banging) (mystic whooshing) (grunting) (grunting) (screaming) (mystic whooshing) (laughing) (mystic whooshing) (metallic thudding) (upbeat music) What? (grunting) (crackling) Now, you die. (gun firing) (banging) (growling) (banging) Now, kill him! (monstrous wailing) (growling) (electronic whirring) (roaring) (gun firing) (gun firing) (monstrous wailing) Go to hell now and never return here! (roaring) (monstrous wailing) (gun firing) (growling) (crackling) He's weak, right! (growling) (fire roaring) (screaming) (downbeat electronic music) (metallic thudding)
