- And so Bathor created man in his own image. In the image of Bathor he created him. Male and female he created them. And to the female, Bathor declared, I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing. In pain shall you bring forth children. Your desire shall be for your husband and he shall rule over you. Now, Bathor declared it so. But he women of our village believe they know their place even better than the Lord does for they bear us no children. They bear us no deference. And they do not drink the blood of Bathor. They, these children of the night feast on the blood of man. But charm is deceitful and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the lord is to be praised. We witness no fear, and yet, these daughters of Bathor not only reject the lord's teachings, but use their flesh to turn us to the side of evil. But the Lord preserves all who love him, but all the wicked will be destroyed. Bathor gave us the key to eternal life and eternal peace in paradise. And now we have betrayed Bathor, and we are to be punished. They are the ones who flaunt their barren flesh, and yet, we are to be punished. We are to be punished. God will forgive all who confess their sin. We must cleanse Bathor's home of this evil. We must purge this darkness. We must slay these demons. In the name of Bathor, our lord, we must spill the blood of the triblades. - You must not get involved. This is not our war. We've waited over a thousand years and we must remain patient. - A war is upon us, Naga. - Your day of vindication will come, Giltine. But this is not our war. - Although they've shown us none, I want to bring justice for us all. - The triblades have left us no choice. They have cursed us with disease. But all of your suffering will not last much longer. We have accomplished many great deeds in the name of Lord Bathor to repay our sins, for when Alnwick was tempted by the barren Bathsheba, and forced to give in to his desires, some of us of faith might say that Lord Bathor had turned his back on us. But we forgive you, Alnwick. - Thank you, Grando. - For Bathor has shown great mercy, and so shall we. We shall bring an end to your suffering. You shall no longer wear the cloth of Bathor. You have given yourself to sin. For your eyes have been used for evil, we shall return them to goodness. Blood to blood, we return to blood of Bathor to the Lord. Remove this empty vessel from my sight. Sanctify yourselves with the blood of our lord. - The blood is the life. - I shall not be honored with the blood of Bathor until I have rid his land of the poison. The land that 2,000 years ago, he presented to us, in exchange for caring for its treasures until his return. Now we have failed Bathor and must suffer until every hope, every path, and every creature is free of the evil that has overtaken us. The lustful sinners must be destroyed. - Blood is life. - Why are we here, I'm bored. They invoke the Red, it must be serious. - Let's go play, it's a beautiful day for a swim. - It'll have to wait. - Yes, it's not very becoming. Not very becoming at all. And on my feeding nights. I hope to get this over with quickly. - Me too, I don't wanna be here. - I'm simply starving. - We should just go. The exit is right around here. - Let's go. - I haven't done anything. It's probably something completely mundane. - They must feel so dreadful with their hair so bright. - Daughters of Bathor, it is with great reluctance that we invoke the Rite of the Red and call you here today. Until now, there have been only rumors of an uprising upon us. But the murder of several of our sisters has shown us that the judgement day is here. - We nephites have convened and consulted our memories of the word of Bathor. And determined that the mercy of Bathor shall be granted only to those of us who hold our faith and do not flee our duties here. The deaths of our sisters purifies us all, for Bathor is just and merciful. - And the light of the candle shine no more on me. And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all that were found slain upon the Earth. - And after these things, I heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying, hallelujah, salvation, glory, and honor, for he has judged the great whore which did corrupt the earth with her fornication. - My sister was a kind and honorable person. Her only sin was to deny those beasts the pleasures of the flesh. - Speak not what you do not understand, my child. Bathor has protected us for 2,000 years and shall return to protect us for an eternity more. We shall not fail in this final trial, we shall not be cast out at the final moment. - This is a test to see who is worthy of living in Bathor's kingdom of peace and joy. - We shall not tolerate rumors of unrest and flight. We shall all remain. The blood is the life. - The blood is the life. - This is the path of fools! We should flee, or we should fight. But we should not sit idly by and be destroyed. - Our word is decided. The blood is the life. Now go. - What do we do? - Bless us, oh, Bathor, for these, thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty. The blood is the life. - Do you remember a time when these people walked the lands? - I can no longer say what I remember. Just that the memory was once mine. I see my mother laughing as she sings a lost song to me. - And what of these others, these other graves. - They are the homes of the forgotten. Their names were written once. I see words dancing on paper surrounded by flame. They were glorious and wonderful, but their age of dancing is gone. The ink has returned to the night sky. And so, we must pass the words on so that no more are forgotten. I know images of pain, suffering, but I do not know what is real and what is imaginary. We've lost everything. Eras far off as the stars, flickering and echoing. They are no longer ours. Our words are gone forever. The fog of forgetfulness creeps from the east every time we do not honor the words of the past. - Aluka, I know you're hungry, my love. I have held you for as long as I can remember and I'll hold you forever more. - How can she continue to expose herself to that innocent child? - She's vile and dishonors Bathor. Only of Bathor's blood shall we drink. - As I suspected, another woman. - You are in great danger. You must leave at once. You must all leave at once. - I have failed my people. We have spent these millennia learning complacency. We cannot fight. We cannot survive without the structures and routines of Bathory. We are caged and now we are turning on ourselves. Just today, I ordered my people to stay in place. I told them it was the will of Bathor because I was afraid of stealing their hope. We have nowhere to go. - I guess we should thank you for driving us out so long ago, but we cannot thank you for the many years of suffering and isolation. But those memories are finally fading. And we are the keepers of history. - Drove you out? - You don't even remember, do you. - I'm afraid not. - The fog curses you and strips you of your clarity. But no matter. Meet us tomorrow night in the clearing to the west of the village. We will guide you to safety, teach you the ways of survival, and record whatever's left of your culture, accomplishments. - Thank you for showing us mercy where we have shown you none. I must find the other red nephites. We will call for a gathering to prepare for the exodus. - When will they come for us? - I do not know, and perhaps I do not wish to know, Fantine. We cannot hide, for whatever time we may have left, we cannot spend it in fear. - But I am afraid, Elisabeth. I am afraid. - Do not fear, Fantine. We are nothing but what we believe ourselves to be, for we've all died many deaths. Once for each of the times we've allowed our spirit to be crushed. And once for each of the times we have acted against that which we believe to be right and just. - What will happen to us when we are slain? - Some say we shall be reborn. Imbued with our true purpose by Lord Bathor. Others doubt whether we are reborn or our eternal fate is to be forgotten. There's a truth that hides among the stars. - Will you stay with me until the end? - I will, Fantine, until the final star returns to the darkness. - I cannot stand by any longer. Although they nothing to preserve our ways, and though they act like children, we cannot simply allow them to be slaughtered. - There were thousands once, according to the teachings. Now only a couple dozen of us left. We must not get involved. - Vengeance is ours. - I have betrayed you all, and I have betrayed Bathor. We must abandon our homes and leave at once. - You have been taken by evil! - We knew there was a traitor among us, but we never would have suspected. - For Bathor, the blood is the life! I want those outsiders destroyed! They mocked Bathor for the last time. Bathor showed them mercy by banishing them instead of executing them, and this is how they repay Bathor? - We have won a great victory. Bathor has rewarded us with this great honor. And at the same, has given us another test of our faith and our will. These wild demons were banished. We believe they had been banished forever but now they have returned, and now they too shall die, and Bathor shall grant us this victory once more. A victory not only of the present, but a victory of the future. We will cleanse the land of Bathor and prepare for his impending return. The second era of Bathor is almost here. Do you doubt the power, the birthright of Bathor? - Bathor is almighty. - Good. Do any of your doubt the power, the honor, the birthright of Bathor? - The blood is the life. - Blood is the life. - I see there is one whose conviction to the right of Bathor is not strong enough. We cannot allow your lack of enthusiasm and commitment to the word of Bathor to fester. You are like a disease. Better see if we can find a cure before it is too late for all of us. Remove your shoes. - I'm sorry. I will fight to uphold the word of Ba-- - How dare you speak the name of Bathor! You must make a blood sacrifice to show you are worthy. Remove your shoes! Now you must complete a test of will to show that Bathor has given you honor. You must walk the path of glass. Bathor has spoken. You transgression has almost been paid. And you've drawn no blood. Now, with your last step, you must make an offering to Bathor. The blood is the life. - Blood is the life. - Bathor has called on us to take up our most difficult quest. We must leave the village and travel to the west, the land that Bathor once forbade, to stop the spread of this pestilence. Today, we each drink twice the blood of Bathor to give us the power in this ultimate battle. Jacob, Stoker, you two shall go forth as scouts to locate our enemy. - The blood is the life. - Sava, Berwick, dispose of this howling animal. - The blood is the life. - I shall take the path to the east. - And I the path to the west. - The blood is the life. - The blood is the life. The blood is the life - You've had your day. The second coming of Bathor is upon us. I hope you're prepared for what you've set in motion. You're covered in the blood of corruption, go wash yourself. - What is this place? - What do all you wild women need with all these things? Have you stolen them? - There is nothing wild about us. We have advanced while you've remained stationary. We are the last preservers of culture. After you banished us, we knew that our destiny was to keep our legacy. And, you, on the other hand, lived in complacent waste. You've accomplished nothing at all as we grasp at sands to keep your memories. - Elisabeth, are you all right? - That book is in her mother tongue, lost for a thousand years. - Giltine, you need to do. Where there is one, there are many. We must take him to the twins. - Do not. - Be alarmed. - You are with. - Friends. - Your blood. - Was full of poison. - The blood of Bathor. - Must be running out. - Your blood. - Is thin. - And impure. - We have cleaned your blood. - As we do our own. What is? What is your name? - I am Jacob, son of Bathor. - Jacob, you. - Are healed. - You must. - Drink. - More fresh. - Blood. - Jacob, we apologize for this, but you must sleep now. - Count down with us from 10. - 10. Nine. Eight. - We shall spill their blood. We will return their flesh to Bathor. Then, and only then-- - I've found them. I've found them! - You have interrupted the word of Bathor, I hope you bring great news. - Indeed I do. - Excellent, prepare your weapons. Jacob, lead us to victory. - No, Grando, you do not understand, they have healed me. I have no wounds. - It is true. - What trickery is this. - We must stop drinking the blood of Bathor! - Blasphemer! Liar! See what they have done? They mean to destroy us from within! They have taken the name of Bathor in vain, and for this, they will pay. We must rid this man of his demons. Behold, Bathor has given us the power to tread upon serpents, and over scorpions, and overall, the power of the enemy. You must confess your sins to Bathor. Fetch Jacob's brother, the unloyal Esau. Bathor's light shines upon him. He's been given an opportunity to redeem himself. - The blood is the life. - The blood is the life. Grando has found some use for you. - You have one last chance in the eyes of Bathor. - You'll do perfectly. Just right for Grando and for Bathor. - He is alive. - Get him to the twins. - Will he be all right? - The twins say he should be fine. - Until he returns to his cult and they kill him anyway. I don't know why we even bother. - I see them off in the distance to the east. - Giltine and I will cut them off before the clearing. - I won't leave without her. She knows the true language of Bathor. - Fine. - Do not. - Be alarmed. - You are with. - Friends. - Your blood. Was full of poison. The blood of Bathor. Must be running out. - So you are the traitor! How could you. - Time for a nap. - Good morning, Fantine. I don't mind if it takes you all day to confess. I'm in no hurry. We have demonized the men for too long. We have made them suffer, though it is us who tempt them with our shame. We must no longer deny our bodies. We must be vessels for Bathor, granting new children for the Lord. Now, Fantine, you must tell me. How can you lift this curse we placed on the men? You must call upon the others to return to the word of Bathor. - We do not remember, or even recall the true word of Bathor. We cannot read the edicts. We only remember what we choose to. - Lie! You were just as foul as Grando said you were. Well, I shall break your will! - We must divert our eyes. The seductress will try to sway us from the word of Bathor with her supple body. Look away and close your eyes tightly. - Run, Elisabeth! - I am hungry, and I am frightened, Elisabeth. - Look at this abomination. Such evil from the bowels of hell should not set foot here on Earth. - And in the same way also, the women abandoned the natural function of the man. And burned in their desire toward one another. Women with women committing indecent acts, and receiving in their own persons, due penalty of their error. - Bathor, we have served you with all of our hearts. We have done all you have asked. We have vanquished all who might destroy you. We protect you in our hearts and minds, and we pray for the day when you may return from your holy conquests to bring peace upon the land. You, you've blessed us with your return. You are not Lord Bathor, you cannot be. But, it can't be, the triblades, they have all been destroyed. - I left you with paradise. I gave you the gift of eternal life. I gave you the gift of perfection, and this is how you honor my name. What have you done to my children? - But all of your children remain. Those who have betrayed you have been returned to the blood. - Returned in my name? What gives you the right to destroy that which I created? - Obeying your words of 2,000 years-- - I left no words! I left no place for your destruction. I left peace and harmony and journeyed off to build our empire. And I have. - You are great, Lord Bathor-- - Enough, enough. You have committed sins in my name. I sought for a world where we could be free, and you turned to hate in my name.
