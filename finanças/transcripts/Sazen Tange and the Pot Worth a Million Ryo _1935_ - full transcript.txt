Tange Sazen and the Pot Worth One Million Ryo The top lord of all of the country... kept an unpredicted military expense... up to one million ryo in gold. The lord... buried the gold underground. And drew a map which would precisely tell the place... He painted the map on the surface of a pot of old monkeys. What? A pot of old monkeys? lt's true. A pot of old monkeys. Then... lf we can find gold with the map on that pot... Our Yagyu country would be the richest in the West area... No, in all of Japan. Congratulations, Milord! You're the richest man in Japan! Congratulations! But, actually the pot of old monkeys is not in my posession anymore. What? l didn't know that the pot had a map which tells the hiding place of the one million ryo... So l gave it to my younger brother. Then the pot of old monkeys is with Sir Genzaburo? He said he wanted to give it to Shiba Dojo as a gift for being adopted as a son-in-law. So he took it with him to Edo. l see... Only if we had known the secret of the pot a month earlier... lf we knew that before he was adopted as their son-in-law, it wouldn't be a problem. What a pity... l know... By the way, does Sir Genzaburo know the secret of the pot? No, l don't think so. What a waste to have that pot without knowing its secret. Yes, you're right. We have to somehow fool Lord Genzaburo... and get back the pot of old monkeys. Therefore, Dainoshin Ko received a secret order from our Lord and headed for Edo. l would appreciate it if the Chief would help us as well. What a surprise that the pot is worth one million ryo. We were shocked, too. Darling... Yes? About that dirty pot over there... l'll feel embarrassed when guests see it. You do? But actually it's an heirloom of our Yagyu family. My dead father told me that. Can l put it in the shed? What? Your older brother is the Lord of the area, right? l think it was very unkind of him... to only give you, his brother, such a dirty pot! l'm just a son-in-law who's only worth a pot! What a shame! No! Please don't say that. You didn't like what l said? lt's not that... l'm sorry! But your brother is really unfair to you. lt's only because l was born a year later than him, there's a big difference between us. lndeed. But at least it can be sold for one ryo, l think. l think it's not even worth three mon. You think so? Please excuse me. A messenger of Lord Yagyu from your home land is visiting you. My brother's messenger? What's the matter... l came here concerned about the pot of old monkeys. What about that pot? No, nothing special. That pot isn't even worth three mon. You're right. You think so too? My wife said the same thing too. Actually l don't like the way my brother treats me. l agree... Brother has a lot of money as the Lord of the castle and the land. And all l got is a pot that's not even worth three mon. Nothing else could be more unfair than this! l agree... He's such a jerk! l agree. My wife said we should put that pot in the shed rather than displaying it. lf you don't need it anymore, l'll take it instead. You're saying you want it back? Yes. l'm concerned that it would break if you put it in a shed. Possible. lt's still the heirloom of our Yagyu family. True. Dainoshin, is that what my brother asked for? Yes. Please give it back to us. My brother said that? Yes. l beg you... l refuse to do so! What? l won't give you back! But you just said you don't need it... lt doesn't matter if l need it or l don't need it... lt's worth the 23,000 goku that my brother has! l'll remember that when l put the pot into the shed! Treats me like an idiot! What happened? He sent a messenger to ask for this pot back! What? l don't care about this pot... But l have pride too! Surely. Your brother is so rude! l don't want to see this pot anymore. Sell it to the junk collectors. Junk collectors! Junk collectors! lf l go back to my country now, l don't know what l can tell Milord... l understand. l would like the Chief to do me a favor, actually. What is it? Fortunately, Genzaburo doesn't know the secret of the pot yet. Of course, l know that already. He didn't want to give it back only because his pride as a second son. ln other words, it's a jealous pride associated with poverty. l see. You mean we need to give him money. lt would be enough to show him some gold. So how much should l prepare for you? l think a hundred ryo would be enough. Only a hundred? So now you want to buy the pot for a hundred ryo. Yes, please let me have it. A hundred ryo, right? Yes, exactly a hundred. Dainoshin, isn't it a little strange that you want to buy that pot for a hundred ryo? ls it? Didn't you say it wasn't even worth three mon? No, l didn't mean that... Shut up! You think l'm blind? No, of course not! My stingy brother would never buy that pot... for a hundred ryo without a reason! There should be a reason for that. Tell me what it is! No, there's no reason... Don't lie to me! Tell me the truth! To tell you the truth, it's only a tea pot. Okay, you don't want to tell me. l have an idea if you won't tell me. Hey! No, wait... Take him to Dojo and knock him around a bit! Sure. No... Hey! Good news! One million ryo! Hey, Hagino! Hagino! Yes, darling. What's the matter? You'll see. Just bring me that tea pot! The pot of old monkies. You're still thinking about that pot? Of course. l'm not a great man but l didn't come to your home as a son-in-law... with something plain as a gift. Really. But l already sold it to a junk collectors today. What? You sold it? Yes. You don't mind, do you? The junk collectors paid ten mon for that old pot. You... idiot! What's wrong? That pot is worth a million ryo! A million! Hey, Shichibei! Hi. How was your day? l guess my business needs some fortune. Welcome back! Hey. Were you good, Yasukichi? What's that? Goldfish! Goldfish? Yasu, it's not a right pot for goldfish. But l don't have any other pot to put it in. l see. Then let's find something. Yasu, that's a goldfish? Yeah. Then l got something for that! Wait. Hey, take your goldfish out and put it in here. lt's a good pot for goldfish, don't you think? Ah, thank you so much. You're welcome. You always get things him. Can't you say thank you? Thank you! Oh, it's nothing. But what is this pot really for? This? Let's see, it should be actually... A pot for goldfish. Wrong! What are you talking about? Don't lie to a kid like that! Yasu, it's not a pot for goldfish, originally. Actually, it's for salted rice crackers. Daddy, you're going to be late again tonight? Go to sleep whenever you feel sleepy, okay? But come back earlier anyway, okay? Okay, l will. Be good, Yasukichi. Hello! hello! Yes. Could you watch Yasu a while for me? Oh, sure! No problem. Shichibei goes out almost every night these days. Where's he going? Oh, you'd hit it if you aim more to the right. l'll get it this time. See? Am l good? lt's getting warm, isn't it? Mr. Shichi, is it really alright that you don't watch your store every night? The head clerk is watching the store. There's almost no customers when it gets dark. l see you're a man of rank. Thanks. But l get tired too because we have so many employees. That's stressful. But if l can play in here every night... l can totally relax and forget about all those stressful things. Ohisa is a beautiful lady. The Mistress is charming and sings for me with her lovely voice sometimes. Oh, l didn't know you were good at flattery. How about letting me hear your beautiful voice tonight? Right, Ohisa? Mistress, please sing! Mistress, it's been a while since last time you sang. So please sing for us. Come on, Mistress! Mistress, please! But l have a cold these days... Anyway, please sing. Mistress, please. Let me get my samisen (three-stringed Japanese banjo). Don't do it, Ohisa! But everybody wants you to sing. Why don't you sing? Don't force her if she doesn't want to sing! l always get a fever whenever she starts singing! A fever? That's right! My head hurts. Sake doesn't taste good either, right? Of course. That's good. lt helps me anyway. My payments to the liquor store decrease too. Okay, everybody, l'll sing for you now. My throat hurts a little but... it's better because l'll get more fever and headache too. Do whatever you want! Of course, l will. Hey, wait a second! l'll go to put a cover on the pot of pickles. This transitory world, sara sara, a pinwheel North wind today, south wind tomorrow But what can I do? Arrows fall in the arrow field, rain falls Look upon, a swallow on the edge of the roof The person who waits for you on a path of a secluded mountain But what can I do? Ten nights, seven swords, the target of love I want a night that nocturnal crows seem to cry... and that I can drink a Sake in honesty. But what can I do? Let me go, a mark of rouge ls this arrow bent? lt can't be! You're right, Brother. They bend the arrows here. That's why l can't hit anything no matter how many times l try. How can l use them! Excuse me, brother! What's the matter? What? l said your arrows are bent because they're really bent! The only things bent here are your hands! What? lf this arrow would hit the mark... we'll turn three times and bark like a dog! Right, Brother? Right. Brother, let me take a look. Uhm? Okay... Hey, the handsome guy over there... You want to turn three times and bark like a dog now? What's so funny, you bastard!? Hisa, go to call the Master! Excuse me, Master! What? l still have Sake. Not sake but our store! What? What's the matter? You son of a bitch! Want me to brake your arm? Hey! Stop! l'll kill you if you make trouble here! Punks! Be quiet! Mater! Wait a second. Sorry that we bothered you. Please forgive us. Master, sorry for making trouble in your store. Please sheathe your sword. All right. Get out of here! Thank you so much... l hate sluggish guys!! Sorry. We're leaving now. You bastard, we'll remember what you did! What did you say, you son of a bitch?! No one will remember your dirty faces! Sorry. l didn't mean to say that to you. Am l going to be all right, Mistress? Don't worry. l'll let our Master accompany you back home tonight. Thank you so much. Master, sorry but... Can you walk Shichibei back to home later? Me? Yes, you. You can do that, right? l'm not going to. l'll go to sleep early tonight. l got a fever from your singing. Please send him back, okay? My head hurts! Send him back! No! l said no. lt's not going to happen!! Here is good enough. Thank you so much. lt's okay. l'll walk you home. No, thank you but... l have many servants, so... l see. You'd be embarrassed if somebody saw a master of a rich family... walking with someone like me. No, that's not what l meant. Whatever. l'm going back. Be careful. Thank you for your help. Thank you again. Hey! Open the door! lt's you? We closed that door already. Can you go around back? ldiot! Open up. Hurry up! Shichibei is injured! Ah, Shichibei... Why did this happen? Why did l make you go with him for? You idiot! Take care of him first! Bring Shochu (a clear distilled liquor) or Sake now. Yasu... What is Yasu? Please take care of Yasu... Hey! Shichibei... Shichibei! Hey, get a hold of yourself. Who's Yasu? Do you know? No, l don't. Maybe his wife? You'll know if you go to his store. We have to let his store know about this. Do you know where it is? No, l don't. Do you know? l don't know exactly either. l remember he said it was close to Ryusen Temple. Hey, how long are you going to keep lying around? Please get up. l'm still tired from walking all day yesterday. Please get yourself together and find that junk collector. lf that junk collector sells the pot... we'll never be able to get it back. You're right... lt's worth one million ryo! One million... Right? Okay, l'll go. By the way, Hagino... Until today... l've spent all my time looking at your beautiful face everyday. l feel lonely when l'm separated from you, even for a day. l'm lonely when l stay home alone too. But think this way, it's for one million ryo! You're right. One million ryo. We should be patient, shouldn't we? Besides, we won't have to do this forever. You'll find the pot today or tomorrow. No way! This job can't even be done in one or two months. lt takes that long? Think about it. Edo is big. Besides, there're so many junk collectors here. Please keep trying. And find that junk collector as soon as possible, okay? lt might take ten or even twenty years. lt's like going out for revenge. Please take this. Yes. So l'll let you do this. Yes. Find the pot as soon as you can. Yes, l'll do my best. Thank you so much. But Edo is a big place... Besides, there're so many junk collectors here. lt's like going out for revenge. lt might take ten or even twenty years. Seems fun to shoot arrows. The target is a little too big. Want to try the smaller one on the left side? That small one? Okay. Mi-chan, the small one! Which one did you choose? The big one, of course. Mi-chan, still the big one. Ouch! That's rude. How many hit the target? Only one arrow. Maybe you should have chosen that target. Which one? That one over there. You came by our store last night, didn't you? Yeah. You remember? l do. Why? Why do you remember? Why? Do you want me to tell you the reason? Sure. The reason is because l'm very manly. Right? Was the woman who sang last night the mistress of this store? Good voice, don't you think? Yes. l didn't see her today, though. Something terrible happened last night. You found it? No. What are we going to do if we can't find it? We should find it easily because it's a big store though. l have no idea. We handed over Mr. Shichibei's body to the governor already. What if we just forget about this whole thing now? But won't you feel sorry about Mr. Shichibei... if we do that? You're right... May l ask you something? Sure. Do you know a big store called 'Shichibei' around here? Shichibei? A big store? Oh, isn't it the small store next to us? Oh, right. There's only one man named Shichibei in our neighborhood. But his store isn't big at all. You two know the store? Shichibei's home? You make a turn that way there and another turn this way. Keep going, and his home is the second one from that corner. Thank you. Hey, you. They said his home is that way. Okay. This is strange. l think so too. Do you know Shichibei's home? Yes, l do. Can you tell me? lt's my home! That one? Yes. l think it's a different Shichibei. Maybe. Let's go. Daddy's not home. He left last night and hasn't come back yet. Really? He hasn't come back since last night? Daddy goes to draw bows every night. Boy, what's your name? l'm Yasukichi, Yasu or Little Yasu. Yasu? He said 'Please take care of Yasu,' right? Sir, do you have something to tell Daddy? No, nothing. l can't believe he said he had so many servants. That's why he didn't want me to walk him home. What's so funny? Go tell that boy that his father's dead. No way. You go. l don't think so. Me neither! Hey, kid. What's the matter, Sir? You... What? Your mother isn't with you any more? No... Really? Then, how about sisters or brothers? No, only Daddy and me. l see. Actually... l have something to tell to you. What is it? Well... Your... Are you hungry? How was it? That boy has neither a mother nor siblings. He's all alone. What a poor boy. So, did he cry? What? Didn't he cry when you told him his daddy is dead. Yeah, about that... What did you say? He said he was hungry. He didn't eat anything yet since this morning. So? l'll feel guilty to make a hungry boy cry. You're right. And l told him if he goes to this lady's home, he can have some delicious food... As much as he wants. He was happy. Who's this lady? You, of course. Me? Me, take him to my home? Let's take him home and feed the poor boy something. You think l would let such a dirty boy come to my place? l'll go to make him cry if you don't want to! Who'll feed him? How is it? Tastes good? Yeah, good. l can tell he's really hungry. That's why he said your food is good. Thank you. Good boy. Your home is so big, Sir. Really? Go play over there. Umm... Tell him about his daddy... and let him go home. Why don't you tell him that? You said you'd tell him. l'm going to watch my store. Hey, you're finally here! My mistress, the good singer. Welcome. Hey, kid. Yes? You... What's your name? Yasukichi. Oh, yeah. Yasukichi. Yasu, right? You can call me Little Yasu too. Hey, Yasu. Yes? What's that? Goldfish? Yes. So small. They're still babies. Don't you want bigger ones? Small ones are cuter. Yasu. Yes? You're strong, aren't you? Yes. You don't cry often because you're strong, right? Yes. l've never cried, not even once. You've never cried, not even once? Never. You sure you never cried since you were born? Sure. Oh, l cried once. When? For what? l cried when Mommy died. An early summer rain, a sound from a little cuckoo in the sky Sunny again Started rowing How was it? Did the boy cry? Yes... Poor boy... He's all alone. l know... He's such a poor boy. l told him l would keep him here for a while. What? l said, 'Our mistress likes kids so much... 'and she would like you.' You idiot! You're so hasty. Do you think l would like such a dirty boy? Really? l'm sorry if you say that. You should be sorry. l won't keep such a kid here, even for a day. l hate kids. Please tell him to go home! Hi, will you go out to look earlier, please? l know... Actually, l want to stay home and relax... and look at your face all day today. Oh, get yourself together, please. lt's one million ryo. One million ryo... But l'm really tired. Don't say such a weak thing. lt's not even been a month yet. Edo is huge and has many junk collectors. lt's like going out for revenge! Who knows it'll take ten or even twenty years. Ten years or twenty years... or even until the day you die... l wish if you would never find the pot. Don't say such a silly thing. lt's one million. But if you found the pot, you wouldn't come here again, would you? You're right. A son-in-law's life is not easy. Here. Hey, kid. Smart boy. He's good enough. Because he's been here for a month already. Really? That long already? And Mistress likes him so much. Ma'am, buy me bamboo stilts. No. Good boys don't play with them. You'll get a bad injury if you fall. But Ma-chan and other boys are playing with them. You know what Ma-chan's father's business, don't you? He's a doctor. A doctor can't feed himself if nobody gets a bad injury. Right? Then never walk on bamboo stilts. Ready? The map is painted on an old monkey pot. One million is a lot. But it's just a legend. l'm not sure it's true. But the taller the tale of money and fighting, the more interesting it is. lt's still five thousand, even half of it. A cowardly lord won't even reach my foot if l can find it. But your wife is interesting woman... to sell it to a junk collector. Hello, welcome. Sir! Buy me goldfish. They're dead. Really? All right. l'll go to fish some for you. No, again? Goldfish? Sounds interesting. l'll go too. Just wait for a second. This is the last one. Hey, how many did l hit the board? Mi-chan, how many? Three. She said three. This is the first time that you hit three. What is this? You get a Dharma doll for hitting three. A one-million ryo pot is a cheerful story when l think about it. lt came from Edo, where it's such a cold place. But for me... lt's like being bitten by a fox. But you'll get one million ryo if you can find it. Hey, l got it. Sir, get the bigger ones! Okay, l'll get the bigger ones now. This one. Here. Silly! That one only has one eye. You're making fun of me? Oh, l got one. See this! You're not good. Get me another one. Sir, it's better if you put some oil from your nose on the string. Oil from my nose? Really? Yes. l see. Excuse me. Sorry but l can't let you do that. Sir. People can still see even if they only have one eye. Of course. l can see very well. Then why does people have two eyes? Do you know? Silly! How would l know? Want me to tell you? lf there weren't two eyes, one lens from a pair of glasses will be unnecessary. That's why people have two eyes. l see. We have two eyes because one lens will be unnecessary if we don't. That's interesting. Please let my husband Genzaburo find the old monkey pot... as soon as possible. There will be good news in a southeast direction about the missing item. l see. There will be good news in a southeast direction about the missing item. Ah, that's the pot! The old monkey pot! Madam, l found the pot! l found the pot! This is the one. Please come over here. Please look through here. Did you see it? That's really the pot, isn't it? Tell me how to fish for a pot in a goldfish store? Hi, Sir. Here you are. What's the matter, Yokichi? l found the junk collector. What? Really? Where? Yes. l'll take you there. Okay. Hey, you found the million ryo pot? Be happy for me. l might become the richest man in Japan. Turn this way around the corner then turn the other way. lt's the second house from the corner, in front of a well. You won't miss it. You're sure nobody's home? Yes. l'll wait here in case he comes back. l'm counting on you. No problem. Hey, Moju. ls this my home? l think so. Hey, junk collector. Where's the pot? The old monkey pot! Pot? The pot you bought from the Shiba Dojo in Tsumagoi Hill. Ah, that pot? l gave that pot to the boy next door. What? Next door. For rent lt's for rent. Where's the boy? We don't know. l heard a samurai with one eye and one arm took him somewhere. One eye and one arm? When did that happen? About a month ago. ls the boy called Yasu or Little Yasu? Do you know Yasu, Sir? No, l don't. Thank you for telling me. Excuse me. That one. lt was that pot. l'm in luck. Yokichi! Where are you? Turn that way around corner then turn this way. lt's the second house from the corner, in front of a well. You can't miss it. Sir, did the junk collector have the pot? No, he didn't. He sold it to someone? l think so. You don't know who he sold it to? He doesn't remember at all. So troublesome. Edo is huge. Who knows it'll take ten or even twenty years. lt's like going out for revenge. Edo is huge. Who knows it'll take ten or even twenty years. lt's like going out for revenge. Excuse me. Yes? Where did you go yesterday? No where in particular. l was just looking around and around. l can't take it anymore. l just want to stay home and relax... and look at your beautiful face today. Then please do what you feel like. What's wrong, Hagino? Not only today. Please stay home everyday from now on. What are you talking about? What about the one million ryo pot? You don't have to go find it. We have many servants in our Dojo. Hagino. Think about it. lt's one million ryo. l know that. This is strange. Hagino, you don't understanding... l'm doing my best everyday to look for the pot. You'll know if you ask Yokichi. l gave Yokichi a vacation this morning. What? Yokichi told me everything you've been doing. What? Yokichi? lf you like to fishing for goldfish... we have many in the pond in our garden. Hey, you! Hagino, don't get excited. You can't even take a step outside today. What are you saying, silly? l'll go out anyway. Jiya. We'll find the pot in place of the Master. We promise to find it. Please don't worry. Please don't go out so often from now on. We beg you. You know, Hagino... l won't believe anything you say anymore. l know l lied to you... l'm sorry that l lied. l apologize. l don't care. Hagiano, l promise what l tell now is definitely true. Actually, l found the old monkey pot already. What? Are you surprised? Where is it? Please show me. l will. l'll show you. l'll bring it back tonight. l promise. l'm not lying, Hagino. Trust me and let me go out another day. Please. You're still trying to fool me, aren't you? No, this is absolutely true. l swear to all the gods! Hagino, trust me. No, l don't. Hagino! No! Hagino! Hagino, wait! He won't come back anymore, will he? Waiting impatiently Can hardly fall asleep Looking through the window Next to the pillow Yasu, what time are you going to stay up until? Go to sleep now. Don't be a bad boy. Maybe l should give him to somebody who likes kids. No, you can't. By the way, l want to talk to you. l want send Yasu to a Dojo tomorrow. What? l don't agree. lt's hard to deal with a boisterous boy even now. And you want him to learn how to fight? But to defeat an enemy, he has to... No. l want him to go to a Teragoya (school). What? A Teragoya? Yes. lt's now necessary for a young man to have knowledge. How will he defeat an enemy? With a pen and ink? He's going to a Dojo! No, he's going to a Teragoya! You're going listen to me this time! He's going to a Dojo tomorrow! Teragoya! Dojo! Teragoya! Dojo!! Teragoya!! Dojo!!! You're writing very well. Really good. He's only been attending the Teragoya for five days. But he's good, right? Really? Then he's got a good feeling. Maybe even Kobodaishi (a famous author) didn't write this well... when he was little. Yasu, you still haven't gone yet? Go now. Katsu, the money lender's son, makes fun of me. You still have to go even he does. Can you walk me to school? Silly. l'm busy. You're really a troublesome boy. Just go now. Sis, walk me to school. She can't do that. She's busy today. Then you send me. l won't let you stay here anymore if you keep saying that. Go, okay? Maybe someone's making him cry. That lender's son is big. Why don't you go and see if you worry about him? Why don't you go? l don't want to. l'm busy working. l didn't eat yet. Do whatever you want. l'm not going anyway. Me neither. l don't want to go either. l'm not going, all right? How did it go? Did you find the pot? l'm sorry. Not yet. Hey, Hagino. You really don't want one million ryo anymore? l do know where it is, you know. Hagino, l beg you. Let me go out. Half of a day is fine. Okay? Forget it. Oh, you got fired? Yes. That was cold of them. l'm sorry to hear that. l'll do my best to work for you from now on. Please use me. All right. l've just got a good job for you. Did everybody finish writting? Yes, Sir. lt's done. Hey, Yokichi. Yes. Post this everywhere in Edo. LOOKlNG FOR A POT Sir, do you have a pot like this? lf you do, l'll buy it for a good price. l've got one. Really? Then, Sir... l'll buy it for one ryo. The pot's worth one ryo? Yes. l'll pay you cash. Here's one ryo. Then wait here. l'll get it for you. Sure, l will. Hello, can you buy me a Menko card? Menko card? All right. Buy it with this. Only one? One is enough. l'll play with this. What? A gold coin? Yeah. l'll going home to get one too. What are you going to do with that? Someone wants to buy this pot for one ryo. But Yasu likes very much. Don't do that to the poor boy. You're right... But... l took the money already. l can't believe what you did. Hey, mine's this big! Hey, l won't sell it. What? Are you kidding me? Here's your money. Then how about two ryo? Sorry but l can't. The kid's using it to keep goldfish. Please don't go. l'll pay two more mon. How about two ryo and two mon. No, no. Look! l won this playing Menko. Oh, no. This is a gold coin. l played Menko with the lender's son Katsu, and l won. Give it back to him. Otherwise, the police will get you. What happened? This boy is such a troublemaker. Thief! Thief! Thief! lt was stolen? Mistress, you should be more honest. lt was a large sum of money, 60 ryo. Who'll believe you? Such a swindler! What? What do you mean, a swindler? lt's a swindle! l'll give you back, so just shut up. Of course, you will. Otherwise, l'll sue you. Give my 60 ryo back right now! All right. l'll pay you tomorrow night. Come and get it then. What? Tomorrow night? Aren't you planning to run away tonight? You think l'm going to believe you? Pay me back right now. l'm saying, wait until tomorrow night! No, l can't wait. What? You can't wait? Hey, you. Stop it! Okay. Mister, your money was really stolen when Yasu went to give it back to you. l'm not lying or hiding anything. l promise l'll give you back tomorrow night. For the sake of our neighborly friendship, would you please wait until then? Make sure you give it back to me tomorrow night, okay? A samurai won't go back on his word. Katsu and his father went home? Quiet. Go inside and cook some rice cakes. lt's unfair of him to ask his money back after he lost it. lsn't it? Just go eat some rice cakes. ls it all right to promise such a thing? What? You sure you can pay it back tomorrow night? Are you kidding me? You're feeding me. Do you think a man who's letting a woman feed him would have 60 ryo? Then, what are you going to do? l don't know. What about you? Now we're really in trouble. That's why l wanted to send him to a Dojo... so that he wouldn't have played such a game. We didn't have to worry about this either. lt's your fault. lt's your fault. Because you gave him a gold coin... and that's how this mistake happened. You're not teaching him very well. lt's all your fault. You! lt's your fault! Don't say silly things. Why didn't you go give the money back? lt was stolen because you let a kid deliver it. lt was your mistake. You shouldn't have brought him home. lf we didn't have him here, this whole thing wouldn't have happened. lt has nothing to do with whether l'm good or bad. Who brought him here? You did, didn't you? That's why it's your fault. Am l right? Yasu, rice cakes are burning. lt smells. Yasu! Are you there? Strange... Yasu! What's wrong? Hey... What's wrong? Hey, look at this! He's gone! Yasu! Yasu! You go to see if he's in the store! Hey, Yasu! Hisa, do you see Yasu? No, l didn't. Please don't fight. Good bye. -Yasukichi. Hey, Yasu! Where have you been? You silly boy. l'm really stupid. Yasu, where have you been? You know you don't have to worry about anything. We're not angry at all. Don't worry. Fifty or sixty ryo isn't a big deal. l'll get it by gambling tonight. Want to come with me? Sounds good. Tell him to let you eat noodles before you come back, okay? Sounds good to you? By the way, do you have some money to gamble? There's the problem. Right now, l can't do anything... So why don't you sell two or three kimonos? l'll go an even number. Odd. Even! Odd! Everyone ready? Game! An even number! You groan every time you lose. One more time. Even number. Even! Odd! l go odd again. Everyone ready? Game! lt's even. Even! You groaned again! lt was just a bad day. You groaned again! Hey, Yasu Close your eyes. Why? Just close your eyes and count one, two, three until ten. Don't open your eyes. Okay? Okay, count now. One, two, three, four, five... six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Yasu, let's go. Why is that man groaning? Because he lost a game. A thief! Thief! No, l'm not. Suspicious man! lt's me! Thief! Thief! Thief! The thief went in here! Someone come out! He's a thief, a suspicious man! Thief! Wait! l'm..Gen..Genzaburo! Ah...Lord... Mistress, you can sell this pot for a ryo. Yeah, that's right. Let's sell this. One ryo is not going to help anything though. But it's better than nothing. You're right. l'm leaving now. You're going to earn money by breaking into a Dojo? lf l say l'll take their signboard... they'll give me ten ryo at least. Will that be all right? Nothing to worry about. Shiba Dojo Please do me a favor! l can't even cry. You're the boss of this Dojo. But you tried to sneak out last night, and they thought you were a thief. And then you were beaten by our servants. l was careless. But it's still a shame no matter how careless you were. Servants were talking about you in the garden just a little while ago. What did they say? Proficiency of the Shinkageryu style is in question now. That's what they said. lt's impolite of them to say such a thing as servants. Who'll listen to them? Excuse me. What? Someone who looks like a monster broke into our Dojo! Really? Yes. He's such a scary man. He's beating our servants one by one. Next! Next! Next! Next! Who's next? Nobody wants to try? Then let me see your boss. Where is he? Here's a great chance for you... to show your ability to our servants. Please go out quickly... and beat that rude man. Oh, my head hurts... Please let me report. Now what? Morimoto's lost just now. What? Morimoto? He lost? Then let Nagai go. Nagai was the first one beaten. What? My head hurts... Here you are. Please get ready. Quickly. Oh, l'm in trouble. l got a stomache ache now. ls it really bad? lt's painful. Then there's nothing we can do. Would you like to let me tell him... that you're sick today and will fight with him another day? That sounds good. Tell him so. But will he leave if you tell him that? Don't worry. He'll be happy to leave if we give him one or two ryo. Good idea. Please leave with this. You think l'm someone who will leave only with one or two ryo? Go get your boss! Now! We're going to lose face to our ancestors... if we let such a rude man leave like that. You're right. Come on, go quickly. And show the servants your real skills. Jiya, he's ready now. Where's your boss? Tell him to come out. Yes. Boss is ready to have a match with you. He finally coming out? Where is he? You? Hey, Hagino. This is the essence of the Shinkageryu style. Watch carefully. Hey, you ronin! The rude things you've been saying are unforgivable! l'm the owner of this Dojo called Genzaburo Yagyu. l'll fight with you although l'm not feeling well today. What? No... You're ready? Hey, lose to me. l beg you. How much are you going to pay me? How much do you want? Sixty ryo. That's too much. l won't leave for one mon less. All right. l'll give sixty. Let me win, okay? Okay, deal. Thank you. Good. Come on! l got his arm! l lost. You won! l'm impressed by your skills. My skills are match with yours. l can't believe you broke into my Dojo with such poor skills. You're an idiot who doesn't know how much he weighs. Hey, you guys. How come you couldn't beat such an unskillful man? What're you doing in this Dojo everyday? Do your best in training from tomorrow! Hey, ronin. You're not bad as a ronin though. You have good sense, too. l want to teach you something privately. Come with me. Yes. l was surprised that this is your Dojo. Me too. l never thought that the rude man who broke into here was you. So l'll have your money. Thank you. Come by sometime. Let's go fishing for goldfish again. Oh, yeah. Goldfish... No, the pot that the kid was keeping goldfish in. What about it? lt's the one million ryo pot. lt's the old monkey pot. Old monkey? Yes, definitely. Excuse me. lt wouldn't be good if you catch a cold. Anyway, why don't you come to study in my Dojo for a couple of years? l'll teach you well. You have good sense. Oh, back so soon? How did it go? Oh, so much? Hey! l can't find the pot. Where is it? Pot? The pot with the goldfish. Oh, that one? Yasu said something so cute. He said that pot can be sold for a ryo. And one ryo will help us out. He sold it for one ryo? Yes, he just left. What's wrong? You fool! That pot's worth one million ryo. lt's the one million ryo pot! Hey, it's him. He killed Kenta's brother. Want something from me? Hey, samurai. Come over here for a while. Why you couldn't you beat such an unskillful man? l don't know what's going to happen to Yagyu-ryu if you men are like this. l'll go looking for the old monkey pot from today. Understoood? Hagino. As l said many times, Edo is huge. lt might take ten years or even twenty years. lt's like going out for revenge. l can't believe that this pot is worth the one million ryo. lt doesn't matter if it's true or not. l'll let you keep that pot for a while. Me? l can't fool around with girls anymore if l tell them l found the pot. Oh, that's why. You hit the target many times today. Of course. The target is different.
