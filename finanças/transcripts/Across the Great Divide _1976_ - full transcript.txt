Hey! Get him, charity! Bite him! Get out of there. Get your hands up. Shoot him in the leg. Now, hold on, boy. I was just admiring your horse. Is your pa around? I'm in the business of buying horses. Don't trust him. He's not for sale. Now back away from that horse. I can see you have a special feeling for this animal, missy, but these are extenuating circumstances. Hold it right there. I'd be willing to pay you 10 time what the animal's worth. $500. $500? That's a lot of money. More than you got. He's the only way out of this territory. We're not planning on selling. That's your mind? That's my mind. I'll be on my way. Where you headed? Over those mountains. Oregon? That's right. Don't do it. We have to. Hey, mister! Maybe we can come to some other arrangements between us. If you let us ride along with you, we'll loan you our horse till we reach oregon. There's just two of you? That's right. You can ride double, can't you? Yes, ma'am. Think we can make it to oregon before the end of the month? We have urgent business there. I don't see why not if we get going right away. What's your business? We're heirs to land, but if we're not in fort williamson by may 31st, it goes to the next of kin. He's the most stingy, undeserving, ...miserly nothing in the world. Besides, he's ugly. Gets your hackles up, huh? He gets me that way sometimes. How come you're on your own like this? A fella hired on to help after grandpa died. He stranded us after the wagon busted. He took more than $40 of our savings to boot. Just can't trust anybody these days. It was an act of providence you showed up when you did. Hey! Whoo! Come back here, mister! Told you not to trust him! Shoot him! Don't stand there! Shoot him! Don't shoot him. That's our horse he's riding. What are you kids doing out here? We're going to oregon. Tell your pa to turn back. It's snowing for another month - up there. Who is that man? A card trickster, robbed the whole town! I knowed it all along! Jason, get the horse. Should have listened to me. Greasy, smiling vagabond. No one's stealing from the smith family. Hurry up! Come on! I'd like to skin him alive, that two-faced jackal. If you listened to me, none of this would have happened. He pulled me in with that sweet-smiling nature of his. Which way? Over there. Hope he drops dead from anthrax poisoning. Hope he falls on his head and loses his mind. Just one move, just one little twitch, and I'll blow your head off. Shoot him. You'll have every indian in the territory on us. I'd sooner face 1,000 heathen blackfeet than deal another second with you, you verminous creature, you thieving trickster. Drop your pants and put your hands up. What? Do as I tell you! Easy. Jason, get the horse. Look, I was planning on coming back just as soon as you got rid of that... those bushwhackers. Bushwhackers? Decent people, you mean... People you just recently robbed. You're an unending liar, mister. Just go ahead and shoot him. Start moving out. My whole life's fallen in ruin. It's your own doing. Look, there's no denying it, missy. Circumstances have forced me... ...to behave less than truthful, but it's circumstances and not an evil nature that's to blame. Hogwash. I don't know why you don't shoot him. Hey, boy. Get down on your belly, or I'll shoot your leg out from you right now! What are you planning to do? Put as much distance as I can between us and your low-evil cunning. Missy, you can't make it... Stay back, mister! Are you crazy? You better get down on your belly right now. You almost killed me. Your lucky I was aiming at your head. Now, jason. What are we going to do now? Keep on going. Turning back now would be like giving up on the whole future. Hope you know the right way. Straight ahead. Look at you, zach... No horse, no supplies, not even a rifle. You can't even talk two kids into a deal. You're losing your touch, boy. Oh... if papa could see you now. ♪ Listen ♪ don't you hear it callin' you? ♪ ♪ Listen ♪ where no one knows our name ♪ ♪ we'll never be the same ♪ we're driftin' with the wind along the way ♪ ♪ where no one knows our name ♪ ♪ we'll never be the same ♪ we're driftin' with the wind along the way ♪ ♪ driftin' ♪ we're driftin' ♪ across the great divide ♪ where the country's big and wide ♪ ♪ but this time we're walkin' free ♪ ♪ that's the way it's gotta be ♪♪ they just keep on staring.

My name is holly smith. I come from a good family. We're going to oregon. Let go of my horse this instant. Jason! You'll live to regret this day, you heathen savages. I'll have general miles carson himself revenge this outrage. What are you saying? What is he saying? He wants to know why you're making me walk behind. What did you tell him? I was drinking, and you're punishing me. Don't listen to him. He'll tell you anything to save his mangy hide. He insulted me, didn't he? He said all men must stick together or women will rule the world. That's right, mister. Hand back that rifle, butt first. We're not going to go through that again, are we? I'm not fooling. Slowly. Back away. You can't make it over those mountains alone. Can't you understand that? You need me as much as I need you. You don't need us, mister. You just need our horses. Come on, jason. Good luck, boy. Boy, that cooking smells good. Think he's going to catch up with us? He's too mean to die on the way. What are you going to do? Depends on what he does. What do you think he'll do? Steal the horses and leave us to die like the tyrant he is. He wouldn't do that. He already did it, didn't he? He said he'd bring back the horse. Now you're falling for his tricks. Lie, charity. I think he's repentant. He's beyond that. Not even the angel gabriel could save his soul. Ahoy! Anybody home? I was just passing through, and I saw your fires, so I thought I'd invite myself to dinner. Jeez! Don't push it any farther, or we'll do what we have to do. I think you got him. I couldn't have. Hey, mister! Hey, mister! Are you hurt? You got him. I couldn't have. I think we got him, jason. What are we going to do? Keep on talking. He's fooling. Maybe we should put him out of his misery... Cut off his head, let the ants eat him. Maybe we should bury him in a hole 9 feet deep. Or maybe we should dump him in the river. Tie a rock to his foot and let him sink to the bottom. Don't play games, mister. Lady... when they gave out hearts, you must have been sleeping. If you're a robber and a rat and you suffer because of it, it's your own doing, and it has nothing to do with us. You awake? Yes. Think we're going to make it? Of course we are. That's a silly question. Wish gramps were with us right now. He's with us. He'll always be with us. Tell me more about oregon. Well, it's the richest land in the world. Every mountain is filled with gold, and the rivers are so heavy with fish that at certain times of the year you can walk across on their backs. There's so many ducks and geese flying around the well-dressed ladies always carry umbrellas to protect their gowns. You're pulling my leg. No, I'm not. It's true. I just can't wait till we get there. Neither can I, jason. Neither can i. Jason. Jason. Don't get too far downstream. She doesn't like the water. There's a big hole right there, jason. Be careful. You're getting too far downstream. Hold onto the horse. Just... hey! Holly! Hold onto the horse, jason! Jason! Hang onto the saddle! Holly! Hang onto the saddle! We still can't let him ride with us, jason. Why not? Because we can't trust him. There's no telling when his lower nature will take over again. I'm not going on without him. We got to trust him. How you doing, boy? Warming up? We thank you for what you did, mister. Just trying to be neighborly. It was a brave thing, and we appreciate it. I'll let you ride double with me from here on, if you want to, mister. Thank you, jason. That's very considerate of you. How come you know how to speak indian? My mother was the daughter of a cheyenne chief. Really? What was she like? Don't remember. She died two years before I was born. You're fooling me. Beautiful country, missy. Is she always like this? Only when she doesn't like you. They're all the same. Creatures of emotion. They can hate you at a drop, then give them a few kind words, and they come back like kittens. Watch. Have you ever seen a picture of the czar's daughter? There's a remarkable resemblance between the two of you. She's considered one of the great beauties of europe, you know that? O.k., it's just going to take a little time. I wouldn't bet on it. I'd be willing to. How much? How much you got? $3.00. You got yourself a deal. Down there. You see it? Good eye, jason. Give me the rifle. I will not. There's a deer down there. Any shooting will be done by me. All right, but hurry up. Come on. He's moving. I can't do it. You got him! You got him! Let's go, jason. Get out of here! Go! Jason, come back here! Stay close to me. Come on. Come on. Don't shoot! Just get out of here! Go on! Go! Ohh! Come on. Wait here. Are you there, mr. Coop? Can you hear me? Is he gone? No, he's sitting right here beside me. What happened to you? What do you mean, what happened to me? Why didn't you shoot him? You said for me to get out of there. That's when I was up in the tree. Didn't you see me fall out? I've never had such a string of luck. People trying to kill me, kids turning against me, grizzlies, and I ain't eaten in three days. You know what that'll do? That'll drive a man crazy. But he didn't take the deer. He didn't? Nope. Well, things are beginning to look up. Do you have a religion, mr. Coop? I was raised a christian. Are you really a trickster? I think most people are at a certain level. Remember, you can't trick a man unless he's aiming to trick you. How come? People like the idea of getting something for nothing. A trickster affords them that opportunity, but all good things come to an end. And they lose. There's a tendency for that to happen. How do you do it? That's the trick. Could you show me? There'll be no gambling. Why not? Because I said so. I don't need your advice. I got hairs on my chin. I don't care if you're as hairy as a monkey. It's when you're smart that counts. Jason, she's right. Tricking and gambling are like the devil and whiskey. They'll sneak up on a man and inflict him. It's a terrible, sad thing, a gambler. He's one of the downtrodden people of this earth. You don't look too bad. Looks can be deceiving. Believe me, beneath these smiling irish eyes is a heart of stone. You mean the blarney stone. Check your cinch. I'll go wake him up. Mr. coop. Mr. coop. Are you sick? What? No. Why? I never seen anybody sleep so late unless they was. Well, what time is it? It's light, and that's late enough. Where you going? We're leaving. Wait a minute. I haven't had my coffee yet. I can't wake up without coffee. You should have thought of that earlier. I was sleeping earlier. You've got 10 seconds, or we're leaving without you. It takes longer than 10 seconds to stand up. Five! I've never met a more cold-blooded, unfeeling man-hater in all my life. I swear you enjoy making people suffer. We have urgent business to attend to. I'm not missing it because of your laziness. That's right. Uncle stingy, right? Our whole future's at stake. We're not losing control of it to some stingy, miserly nothing. Well, I certainly can understand that, missy. Nobody likes living under a tyrant. Right, jason? Do you always get up like that? Only when I haven't had coffee. Good morning. Morning. You never did tell me your name. Smith. Jason and holly smith. Good common name. We're special people, mr. Coop. Some other people with lesser names choose ours as a step in the right direction. You don't say. You should think about it. Smith. Zachariah smith? Coop. Zachariah coop. Smith. Nope. It's got to be coop. Zachariah coop! Mr. coop! Mr. coop! Mr. coop! Mr. coop! Are you hurt? No, I'm all right. Can you make it back up here? How's the horse? It went down the trail. See if you can catch her. I'll go. You stay here, jason. I'll take the rifle. Did he get you bad? No. Just glad that cat doesn't like water. It's just a bunch of deep scratches. O.k., put some of that on it, then cover it up. That'll kill anything. Go on. Got to hand it to you. Didn't squeal out or nothing when he jumped you. I didn't? Nothing. Never saw anyone so calm and collected. Well, there's no sense in panicking. He went right on down the mountain. Now what'll we do? Just keep right on going. A good christian doesn't flinch from difficulty. He doesn't quote them by drinking, either. Medicinal. Purely medicinal. You have no self-respect, mr. Coop. Did you hear that, jason? The great grand duchess of the high pyrenees herself has just spoken. We just lost all our food again. That wouldn't concern mr. Coop at this moment. Missy, it has been mr. Coop who has fed us in the past, and mr. Coop will feed us in the future. Like I said, when you're lucky, you're lucky. Thank you, lad. Now, onward, christian soldiers. Stay close. We'll have no stragglers. The irish dog dance. Come, come. Let's go. You should've never let him start drinking. He's too big for me to stop. Now what are we going to do? We'll have to watch him. The last thing we need is another responsibility. Watch out for snow snakes and eskimo bears. Maybe we should let him ride. Better just let him walk it off. At least he's going the right way. Hold it! Hold it! We'll camp here. Angela. Oh, angela. Do you think he'll be all right? He'll be just fine... until he wakes up. Uhh. Ohh. Ohh. Uhh. Thanks. Good night. Mr. coop. Mr. coop. What is it? What the heck? Aw, it just snowed. It's all piled up. Where are the horses? They were over there. Where? Over there. They're gone now. Snow must've spooked them. I heard some wolves last night. There's no wolves up this high, jason. Now what are we going to do? Get off this mountain as fast as we can. We can't spend another night up here. Wear your blankets. Holly? You all right? You're going to make it. You don't want to leave that land to the stingiest, most undeserving nothing in the world, do you? Huh? No. No. Well, come on, then. Let's go get it. O.k.? How's jason doing? Jason's doing fine. He's tough. He's like his sister. Holly? Don't stop, holly. Go on. I'll catch up with you... later. If you stop now, you're going to die out here. I don't care. What? I don't care! It's just over this ridge, holly! You don't know that, coop! I do! I'm telling you, we've made it! Come on! Come on, holly! Come on, holly! I'll prove it to you! Come on, holly! We made it, holly! Come on! Come on! You're tricking, coop. You're tricking like you're always tricking. Is it really up there? I don't know, jason. How did you know? It's my profession. I'm a gambler. Let's go. Thank you, charity. Wild onions and mushrooms. Oh, I'm starved! I'll try to get us some meat. Good luck. Keep the fire going. Easy, charity. There's nothing there. Jason! Jason! Holly! Jason! Holly! Mr. coop! Watch charity! Mr. coop! Mr. coop! Keep away! Charity. Charity. Charity, charity. What's the matter with her? Let me see. She's all right. She's just frightened. Thank god you came back! We were clubbing 'em and everything. They kept coming back. Why didn't you use your pistol? It doesn't have any bullets. Well, neither does the rifle now. Go back to sleep. It's o.k. got one! Told you I could catch one! Oops. Oh, well. That's all right, jason. We've had enough already. Mr. coop? What will you do when we reach civilization? Well, that depends. On what? On how my luck's running. If it runs good, I'll have a high old time. Doing what? First thing... There's no need to say. We have imaginations. I don't. Tell you all about it some other time. Ever think about settling down? I've never been able to cotton to that idea, jason. Can't change spots on a leopard, jason. Let's get out of here! Indians! They're supposed to be friendly around here. These have got war paint. Come on. There's another one. Get down. Get down. Aah! Get out of here! That war paint gives me the shivers. They're wearing it for the grizzly. He's already killed two people from this village. Don't they have guns? White man don't like them to. That was a very brave thing that you did. Pretty foolish, now that I think about it. He says we're welcome to spend the night. They're going to feed us. Let's get down. See how they treat the women around here? They do all the work. That's the way it's meant to be... All part of god's great plan. I kind of like it. Don't you start now. What did he say? Oh, nothing. He was talking about me, wasn't he? Said I should be working with those other women. You tell him I'm nobody's slave! What he said was, you remind him of the strawberry moon and the flowers when they cover the prairie and the buffalo are having their young and the world is warm and happy again. You're full of it, coop. That's what he said. It was a very nice compliment. Can't you take a compliment? He's a very nice man. Get in the teepee! Must be the grizzly. She wants us to keep away from the sides of the teepee. Oh! Charity, where have you been? Come here, charity. Mr. coop! Yaah! Mr. coop! Mr. coop! Mr. coop! Mr. coop! Get out! Get out! Get outside! Beautiful. Holly! Look what we found! He's raising them 'cause their mother got killed. His name's red wing, and he invited us to go riding. We have an appointment to keep. We have time. Look at mr. Coop. He won't be awake for hours, and it would be bad manners to refuse. Go! Morning, mosa. Hi. How was your ride? What are you doing? Can you believe it? Somebody taught these boys how to play cards. O.k. o.k.? Ahh. Have you no shame taking advantage of these innocent people? That's just robbing and stealing. Robbing and stealing? What are you talking about? We're playing a friendly game. Everybody's enjoying themselves. See that? The chief just won the last game. I mean, this guy's tough. Very good, chief. O.k. O.k. What are you getting so upset about? I'm not upset. I'm ashamed. Ashamed of being a part of tricking and robbing. Coop doesn't see it like that. To him it's only a game. A game that only he wins. But sooner or later, they're going to find him out. Then they'll probably skin him alive. And maybe us, too. They don't do things like that. Well, whatever they do, he'll deserve it. By that time, I only hope we'll be in oregon. It's between you and me. What do you got? Show me. Just not your day, grey fox. O.k. Will you please tell the chief we're leaving now and that we thank him for his kindness? We traded the rifle for a canoe. You can handle one? Will you just tell him what we said, please? He says you're welcome. Goodbye, mr. Coop. Thank you for everything. You take real good care of yourself, boy. I thought you said you could handle one. You know, you were right. I never should have gambled with those indians. They just won back everything I had. You know, I feel sorry for you. Me? You're addicted to it. It's in your blood... like an egg-sucking dog. Well, it's a problem, I grant you, but I'm working on it. Ain't easy for a man to overcome years of corruption just like that. Is everything just a joke to you? I'm not joking. Now look what you made me do. The thing I hate worse than anything is a crybaby. Now I'm making a fool of myself in front of the whole world. No, you're not. Everybody around here has cried at some time or another. Not you. I sure have. I've cried at everything from bedwetting to... having somebody I really love die on me. Hey... look at me. You're going to make it, and you're going to make it on time. Jason and I are going to see to it. I'll give up gambling until I get you there. And that's a promise. I don't believe it. Well, I'd be willing to bet you... You ready to go, boy? Hold on! Jason, move forward. Move forward. What's happening? We're going down! O.k. Hang onto the canoe. Hang onto the canoe. You all right? They told me that the river was safe. Jason needed a bath anyway. Hey. It's no joking matter. One more day, then we lose all our land. Well, let's keep going. Come on. West. I told you it was the richest land in the world. Are they dangerous? No. We'll just give them a lot of room. We better get going. Charity, come back here! She's all right. She's just playing. She probably thinks they're cows. Watch out, girl. Hold it. Hold it. Let's get out of here! Come on! Club, how many you get? There's three right over there. Three? They's thicker than flies, and you only got three? Are you crazy, mister? You nearly killed us! Easy. They got guns. Come on. Take it easy. Howdy. Howdy. Can you tell me how far fort williams is? You're looking at a good two days' walk. Two days? That's lady and matthew. Those are our horses you got. Young 'un, them's mine. Stay away from that wagon. Tell him, mr. Coop. She's stating a fact, mister. We lost them up on top of the mountains. They ran off on us. Horse pucky. Mister, I paid hard grade for them horses, and that says they mine. If you bought stolen property, that's your own loss. Want me to have that lady sit on you? Now, the man... the man's got a point. He had no way of knowing our horses were lost. We'll pay you what they cost. Well, how much you offering? How much? $43... and 85 cents. Ain't enough. We got 10 more. All right. That's $53.85. Still ain't enough. Well, mister, that's all we got. Well, then I guess you're going to be walking, ain't you? Uh, that is, uh... unless you'd like to gamble with some of that money. Gambling? Well, you know, club here, uh... This here is club... Uh, we got a little game we play out here, sometimes just to pass the time. Call it poker. Poker. Yeah. You ever play it? Uh, yeah, I've played it, uh... once a year at a church social. Good. Fat mary, get that old deck of cards out of the wagon, would you? Me and my new friend here... we going to play us a game. Skin him alive, coop. All righty. First thing we do... Put our weapons on the table. I ain't got no gun. He ain't got no gun. Well, I guess there ain't no reason to put the guns on the table then, is there? This is going to be five-card draw. O.k. you want to play for the whole thing, or you want to sort of split it up? If we're going to play, let's just shoot it all. Good, if I'm putting up that mare and that foal for what you got there. Uh... you're kind of cute. Uh, ain't you supposed to cut for the deal? That's right. I forgot. Go ahead. That's the "a" card. We won. We won! You just won the deal, boy. Go on. Get on with it. O.k. O.k. 1... 1... 2... how many cards you got? I got three. 4... 4... 5... and... and... give me, uh... two. Two. O.k. I'll take four. Four? He... he take four. Yeah. Uh... four. Well, what you got? A pair of 10s. Well, I'm sorry, friend, but that don't beat two pair. And then I got these three left over. Does that beat you? Yeah. Yeah, that... that beats me. We beat you! We won! We won! I want to thank you. It's been a pleasure. Thank you very much. Wait a minute. Hold on. I'm double or nothin' to you. Well, what are you going to bet? I'm putting up my papered thoroughbred mare. Papered? O.k. I'd like to, uh... talk to my partners about this first, though, o.k.? Are you still carrying that little derringer? O.k. Slip it underneath me real easy. Right? Right. Right. O.k... we'll do it. Double or nothing. Let's go. All righty. First I want you two young'uns out of here. You making me nervous. Come on, jason. Let's go see our horses. Go on, boy. Deal 'em up. O.k. All right. One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me. Give me... one. One. Ain't you supposed to give me one back when I give you one? Yeah. You got one back. Thank you. I'm going to take two. Well, what you got? What do you got? Ain't got much. Just a little old... full house. Kings high. Close. Yeah. Full house... aces high. You can't be that lucky, mister. Ain't it something? I could hardly believe it myself. Well, I... I guess it don't matter nohow. You ain't taking nothing with you. Club... blow a hole in him. Nobody move. I'll blow his head off! Back away from that rifle! Back away from that rifle. I got him covered, mr. Coop. Some people just shouldn't gamble. Ipistola! Ipistola! Saddle the horse, jase. Everybody, down on your bellies! Come on! Get down! I swear now. You, too, lady! Get down on your... Get down, lady! He said get down on your belly! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Let's get out of here. Yahoo! Yahoo! Some hotshot gambler... let that tinhorn take our horses. Don't blame this on me. You should've blowed a hole in him. Any fool could've told you that derringer wasn't loaded. He was pointing it at you. Quit fighting and help me up. I can't breathe. Come on, fellas. Shut up, woman! It's your fault! You should've given me the right card! Dang. I'm mad enough to eat skunk. That was the most fun I ever had. Sure was. Whoa. Well... looks like you made it. I'd be willing to bet you 1/2 of 400 acres of prime bottom land that you couldn't sit still and work it for a year. Farming? It'd be a whole new future of gambling and high adventure. Gambling and high adventure? You'd be living with us. Now, there's the high adventure, but where's the gambling? You'd be gambling with the elements, light, cows that kick, sneaky rust... You're putting him right off. Putting me right off. Those are the odds. Odds? We can beat 'em. How? If I've told you once, I've told you a hundred times. When you're lucky... you're lucky! Yahoo!
