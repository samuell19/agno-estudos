I can't bear it! Take me there quickly! Oh no! Take me quickly! Oh no! My God! I'm not well! Mother Mary! Mom has been admitted to the ICU. Hey! It's a hospital case. Bring a bag full of cash when you come. Quiet! Okay. I'll call you soon. - Name & details of the patient? Theyyamma. - What? Theyyamma. Age? - Around 65-70... Write 70 over there. Are you her son? - No. I am her driver. Sugunan. Age - 30. Her owner will come now. He's on the way! I was asked to bring the scan report. - Show it inside. Sir, the parking is not here. It's over there. Just hold this happily. Please park it. What is he doing!! It's the starting stage of gall bladder stone for your mother. Everything will be all right. Hey! There's nothing to be scared of. A couple of stones in her gall bladder. We can take them out with a keyhole surgery easily. Throw them away then, sir. We needn't do it so quickly. For the time being, I've given her medicines for sedation. And yeah... There are some formalities for the surgery. Sign the consent letter, and pay the cash at the counter. By cash you mean...? Around 2 Lakhs. It's a small surgery, right? Money is not a problem for me. It's for my mother, right? - Yes. Please don't mind, Doctor. I will pay 2 Lakhs. From that, what will I get? - What? If I pay 2 Lakhs here for mom's surgery, what commission would I get from it? To pay a commission, the stone that's being operated out of your mom's belly, is not granite or marble! I know all that! But for this Sugunan's corner seed operation... ... at Ashwathy hospital... Corner seed's... - What? Corner seed! Piles! When it was operated out, they kept 20% of the bill back into my palm. Hey! We don't do such adjustments here. - No need! There are hospitals with adjustments, right? I'll take her there. You said that there is time anyway, right? Can you please discharge my mother? What all are you saying? You idiot! Didn't I tell you not to bring her here? Doctor, if he opens his mouth, it's like Idukki dam's shutters being opened. It will spread all over town. Not being able to take out a small stone, if you send a patient back, and if people know that tomorrow, Oh God! This hospital's situation! - Oh God! Come! You've been pushing this for a long time now! Can't you keep it somewhere? One guy put me in trouble in the morning itself. This one doesn't have a stand! I can sit, right? - Yes, sit. Look, Mister.... It's not because we're scared that it would affect our reputation, .. if you discharge the patient from here, and take her to another hospital. It's because this case is unique. So we neednâ€™t talk much. After reducing 20%, you can pay the rest of the amount. 20%? - Yes. I'll get that even in the other hospital. I needn't have to talk so much also. Minimum 25%.... If it's difficult, discharge my mother! Sir, I'll discharge her. Wait. You do one thing. 25% of 2 Lakhs is 50,000. So reduce that and pay 1.5 Lakhs. Hey! Don't say that! Huh? Why? Don't say that! If you ask me to pay, I'll pay 2 Lakhs in full. From that, you can give me my commission now. Commission at the end. That's the tradition. But for me, commission at the beginning. That's my line! Here. It became a commission only now. If I pay 1.5 instead of 2, like you said, it would only be a discount. When I bargain and get back an amount from the money I've paid, and keep it in my bag, there's this great feeling. Only us Malayalis would understand that. That's a superb feeling! You don't have to be so sad about this, Doctor Moopen. If the medicine companies don't pay commission, don't you ask for it? Car, fridge, TV, European tour... Why? Don't you even take European commodes as commission? I haven't stooped so low! So let things be awesome! There shouldn't be any negligence towards my mother because of this. This Jesus is witness to whatever happened here. Along with that, a small hidden camera too. Here. Hey! Don't worry. My mom's life is in your hands now. And your lives are in my hands. Now wherever we go, they ask for digital evidence. Otherwise, you guys have the usual doctors' dialogue, right? Sorry, Mister... We tried our best! But your mother... I made Jesus a witness, so that you wouldn't say that. Shall I leave then? Oh no! The money! Where was this guy born? Mr. Ittimathan... Come fast. Your wife is about to give birth. Theyyamma, don't be scared. Try once more. Try once more. Push! Push! It's a boy! Ittimaany! Ittimoney!! - No! No! Ittimaany. It's my father's name! Ittichan, good morning! Good morning! What? He said good morning! It's Chinese language! Good morning! Hey Sainu! Is there any order for chilli chicken? Order? - Yes. For us? - Yes. I was making some Upma. I just added some chicken Masala to get some fragrance. My stomach is cursing me due to hunger! Do you want some, boss? Chilli Upma! Chilli Upma? - Yes. Yeah. Here. If there was a bulls-eye on top of this, it would have been awesome! If I sit to lay, eggs won't come out. - Shucks! Is this the language in which a worker speaks to a boss? But our relationship is not such, right? Then what's our relationship like? Aren't we buddies, boss? What's happening there? It's a chicken we bought for catering purpose recently. Since that chicken doesn't know to commit suicide, it's crying, 'Please kill me!' Will we get an order before that chicken grows breasts? Hey! - I'll tell you something, if you won't feel bad. Let's stop this stupid catering service, and start a street food joint! Tapioca & intestine curry. It will be awesome! 'You go and start it with your dad!' Rest I'll tell you when I come back. He must have sworn at my dad! But since it's in Chinese, it sounds good. You broke your promise in the first deal between us itself. Tell me the matter, man. The fatso is furious. Where is its bend? What? This is Sri Lankan cashew. This is Brazilian. This one is African. Just that there's a small difference in size. He is awesome! All these have the same flavour. Palakkad Matta rice, Besan and white flour. Then a little cashew essence. Look at me. If I mix all this and pour it into the dye, not just the bend you asked for, I can even make you cashews with two horns! Medicines are sprayed to avoid insects and fungus, on to the original cashews. There's nothing like that here. I won't do any job risking the health of the people! Sincere duplicates! That's the theory of Manikkunnel family. You need to take the load only if you're interested. Sainu! Hey! Long back in Kunnamkulam, when you could get everything except parents here, boss' grandpa was the uncrowned king in the business of duplicates. Senior Ittimaany. Do you want it? - No. The Chinese who came here for business then, got impressed by grandpa's talent, and took him with them. Is it? - Of course. This is our kitchen. Boss has no compromise in matters of hygiene. This is our pet rat. So what I was saying... The sight he saw in China, brought tears to grandpa's eyes. They were so poor and hungry that 10-12 people would share and eat a slim snake. Finally, grandpa taught them his family profession. The trick to make duplicates that can beat the originals. That's how the poverty stricken Cheena, became today's famous China. Can't believe it? Come. After going to China, as soon as boss was born, grandpa's flex was printed. Grandpa died! Shang Shu... And that's our 'Made in China' man! Tell me about the commission. So how did Ittichan come back here from China? - That? The picture tube of a TV that boss' father made, didn't stop working even after 5 years. Isn't that a good thing? For the Chinese, it's not such a good thing. Whatever they make, shouldn't last longer than 6 months! They packed boss' father away right then! After coming back here, he made this hotel to have Chinese food. I am the cook here. Shall I get you a plate of cockroach fry? - No. No? When his father died, the hotel flopped. Now we're running it as the front office of our business of duplicates. Come. You have such a great family heritage... What? - You have such great family heritage. I mistook you! Sorry. As you said, make it the African ones with horns! Okay! Rest, when I get the load. - Okay. Okay. - Bye. He's like a burger with hands & legs. But he's a good guy. Boss, I need 5000 Rupees. Mom is not well. Didn't you take 10,000 from me last time saying that your mom died? What can I do if my dad married four times? You needn't do anything. Your dad has done what needed to be done! Sheesh! Don't grin. I'll pop open your tummy! Oh God! You'll burn me to death. 'It's time to break the stones, Theyyamma' Very funny! Don't call me.. If I say I need 2.5% commission, that's final. Hang up, you idiot. You keep taking commissions from everywhere! If you had married in your heydays, your wife would have given me company now. She has a point. She is not as healthy as she was earlier. My God! This item? Though I'm your only son, I'm always by your side, right? If I had married, that girl would get half my love, right? Now that's not the case, right? Now I'm giving it fully to you, right? Enough! Enough! Both mom and son seem to be really happy! - Leave me. She's proud that she gave birth to such a son, Annamma aunty! Why did you rush here in the night? I'll come back there in 2 days, right? How are you now? When a load of stones were removed from her tummy, she became really smart! Hey! Your eldest son Alex studied with him, right? He has two children now! Sigh! She wants me to get married now. That's all. I'm going for a match making next Sunday. It will happen. Yeah, right! It will happen if he stops this commission business. That's common these days, right? He didn't steal or snatch from anyone, right? You are smart, Annamma aunty. If I marry, I should marry someone like her. Annamma aunty! How many years has it been since Avarachayan died? How long will you live alone like this? Just get up! Stand up! Mom! Just look! Don't we make a good match? Right? - Not bad. Get lost! See! If we say something serious, he'll avoid it saying something silly like this. I'm taking my phone! I'm leaving. If I stay here any longer, I'll fight with this crone. Come home! I'll show you! - I'll show you too! I said I'll sort him out once we get home. Why do you always fight with him? - That's just for fun! It has become a habit for both of us. Whatever said and done, you are lucky, Theyyamma. He treats you royally! The Vicar used to give money without any hesitation, since it was for the Church bell. It's already gone over budget. Rest, after you finish the work. That's enough. Don't put me in trouble. Anyway, I must get at least 10,000 more. Bhaskaran, you're such a nuisance. I won't ask after this. I swear. - Okay. Let me talk to the Father. Ittichan, your tea! - Keep it there. Tea has come as courier? Sathish, I need tea for two people tomorrow. Mom will be discharged today. It's really sad that you can't buy some milk and make two glasses of tea! Dude, he stays right next door. When he milks the cow and makes tea, he just has to make two glasses extra, right? Should I wash the dishes & light up the stove? That's nice! Then I'm also going to get tea delivered instead of milk, from tomorrow. I can save the gas and the effort too! You are a textbook, Ittichan! - Is it? Light the lamp in the evening, and learn from it then! Stop troubling me and finish building the bell! That's true. It's not the tea. The bell has to be made now. Phew! I forgot the main matter. Ittichan! When will she get discharged today? I'm going there, Annamma aunty. Sugunan and Sindhu are there. Hey! Avarachan's death anniversary is approaching. I have to buy some groceries. Why not, Annamma aunty? Keep the list ready. I'll come now. Annamma aunty... Will your 3 children come at least this time? They haven't come this way in a long time. That's why I asked. This time they'll definitely come. 25 years are getting completed since their father's death, right? M...o....m...!! Oh no! Coming home with a siren to scare people? It will be a pride for mom if people know this, right? - Shut up! Come, mom! Move away! Come, Theyyamma. - Move. Don't touch me. Why did you come like this? When I saw the ambulance, I lost breath for a moment. I won't die so soon. Did you hear me? - What did I do? Hey! What is this? - Have your medicines on time. Okay, Doctor. You had also come, Doctor? That video? Which video? - That 'other' video! 'Other' video? This... Not that! That day's.... So this set-up was for that? I was also wondering why you came. How long should mom take medicines? - 2 weeks. So, after 2 weeks, I'll ask Jesus to delete that video. Fine? Will Jesus delete it? - All our memory cards are with Jesus, right? Get going, Doctor. He will delete it. Not Jesus, Doctor. Ittichan will delete it. Tell me what's the matter. Do you know what he did? When his own mother was about to die inside, the son was bargaining for commission outside. Who? Ittichan? Yes! Who else? That's why her face was so bloated up when she came. I came to know only when that Doctor told me. Bloody rascal without an ethics! Sheesh! Would he do so? - Are you surprised? If he can get commission, he would get even me married! Is it? - Get lost! True! I took commission! If I ask them to reduce 10 Rupees from the bill, no one would agree. But when it became a commission, see... Your stone is gone, and I saved 50,000 Rupees too. A son doing so much for his mother is wrong or what? Big deal! You made them agree, by attaching a camera on Jesus on a cross? Look! This Jesus doesn't have any camera. I just fooled them saying that there's a camera in this, so that she gets good treatment. I don't think what he did was wrong. Please tell her that, Annamma aunty. Along with the stones in her stomach, I think they took out what was in her head too! Hey! Just check here... ... if there are any marks. What marks? Who knows! Whether he sold my kidney while I was lying unconscious! I had already sold one of it long back! See! There was a live show of our tiger dance today on TV! I missed that because of you! Couldn't you tell me at least yesterday about this match making meet? What's there to specify! It's a routine on every Sunday, right? Just go fast! Where to? I am standing on the accelerator, to get this pulling. The day I drive this, my wife doesn't let me sleep next to her. Why? - She says she would get septic. Hey! I got scared! Sit there, broker! Well... If we go there in an ambulance, what would the girl's family think? What are they going to think? I'm thinking about holding my first night also in this. Is it? - Yes. That would be a variety. You'll have ghosts to guard you too. Well, bro... Gone? What's your name? Paulinos. Also known as Pauly. But we'll call you Nivin Pauly. Hey Pearle... - Not Pearle... Pauly! Well, Pauly... Have you told them everything in detail? What? Well, about my age. Sheesh! That's not an issue for them! Is she good looking? The girl? I saw her even yesterday. If you see her standing at the altar, it's like an angel has descended. She's super hot! Hot? - No.. I mean... She's a nice girl. Hey Sugunan! Fire it up, buddy! - Firing away! We've reached their house. Switch off that siren at least now. Or the girl would run through the fields. Sugunan.... This is nice! - Yes. How much would land cost here? Have we come to see the girl, or her land? Since the girl's father is dead, after her mother's death, both children will have equal share of the wealth. So it's good to know the price of the land, the number of fruits on the tree, etc. That's true. - Pearle is calling. Not Pearle. Pauly. - Please open this. You're sitting here? It's so hot inside. Corpses should be saluted for lying inside this. Didn't you switch on the AC for Pearle? It had AC? - Of course. Come. Why have you come in an ambulance? Since we came in a hurry... Ittichan will go to see girls, only in his own vehicle. He's really proud like that. Do you have conjunctivitis? Mom, they have reached. Please come. Do you export jack fruits? No exporting. Only importing. Jack fruits are a weakness for me. Come. Come inside. Saw the guy's humility? - Who's this Saint with glasses? Not impressive at all. He's not a saint, you idiot. That's the girl's dead father. Sit down. Sit. I don't have to introduce Ittichan to you, right mom? - Of course! Please sit. Though it has been only some time since we came to this town, we know you really well. Well, who is this? I am Ittichan's dri... friend. Is the Church bell's work completed? It's going on. I'll bring tea for you. That's nice. - Okay. What's your name? Pothen. I asked your name. That's my name. Joji Pothen. Such a matching title. What's your job? - At the bank... Manager? - No. You know that my sister is in London, right? So, all the cash dealings in the bank... That's it. So you don't have any job! There should be someone to do this too, right? Yes. Hey! If she's ready, please call the girl. Let them see her. - Okay. Just a minute. Hey! London! Fool! Hey! Since the brother-in-law is an idiot, if you play it smoothly, this whole set-up would end up with you. Why? Don't you want it? Hi-tech family! Tea is coming on a laptop. Will the snacks come on WhatsApp? Did he get his mom ready for a second marriage? She was supposed to come yesterday. But there was some emergency in the hospital suddenly. Her leave got cancelled. Err... What can I do? Don't blame him. It happened all of a sudden. I'll solve it. This is Jessy. - Hi. Now you can see her live and talk to her. Move! Shall we step outside? They would want to talk to each other, right? - Sure. Okay. Hey! See her completely! Now? - It might be graphics. Completely, okay? This is my first time. What? Well... Meeting a girl for match making through a computer. I've seen you at the Church. Me? Is it? Ittimathan is the grace of this vehicle. Why is it written there? This vehicle is in Ittichan's father's remembrance! An ambulance in remembrance? Yes. His father died while he was being taken in this. He bought this saying that his father made his final journey in this. Good that he didn't die in a train. Otherwise, I'd have had to build a railway station here! Just a minute. Hello! I'm busy today. Sister's match making. Then why did it get late? I will only marry a girl who works abroad... That's why it got so late. Why are you adamant about that? I am just adamant about it. So that you could hang around here eating and boozing, without doing any job, right? Little devil! Ittimaany. I liked your name. Jessy Pothen. I also liked it. Actually, I was supposed to come. Did you see her? - But I didnâ€™t get leave. Saw her completely? What's happening there? Ask her! No one saw that. Hello? I'll call you back. Uncle is coming. Okay. Joji, dear... Have they come? - Yes. Are they upset that the girl hasn't come? - No problem. That match making is happening live on video call inside. Phew! Science has progressed so much! Jessy, dear... - Hi uncle! Did you like our girl? He liked you! Did you like him? She's shy! See! She liked you! Little devil! Since both of you liked each other, uncle is going to fix this. What say? Then we'll let you know about everything through Nivin Pauly. Okay. - Come, let's go. So, shall we? So, we'll do the betrothal soon... and then three announcements, and then, the wedding. The cup. - Give it to me. Bye. Joji, I'll call you. - Okay. Brother-in-law! What is this, bro? You didn't say bye! Say it. Bye! Shang Shu... Don't you want to attend Ittichan's wedding? Anyway, the girl has liked Ittichan. Then... About the dowry, right? - Yes. They will give Rs. 10 Lakhs and 101 sovereigns of gold. So there's no car? Instead of the car, they're giving .... so much money, right? So what about you? Usually, I don't get much from the bride's house. - That's a lie. No! I swear! I should be getting it from here, right? According to the current market value, I should get at least Rs. 2 Lakhs. You will get it. - Right? Okay. Now I'll tell you about me. I'm only used to taking money. So, one for you... One for me. What? - Hey! You should give half of your commission to Ittichan. Half of my commission? That won't happen! Only that will happen, or else the wedding won't happen. How can you say that? - Hello! This is the norm here. This is Ittichan's 34th match making. - Hey! It's 36. - Yes. It's 36. Hey! When we ran out of brokers here, we brought you here from the next district, to make such deals as well. Aren't you ashamed to take commissions for your own wedding? Not ashamed at all! If you can take commission from the dowry I'm getting, why should I be ashamed of taking from commission from your commission? Hey man! You are getting this commission because Ittichan is getting married, right? Why are you hesitant to give him half of that commission? When Ittichan will divorce that girl... - Hey! What if you do it some time? Would you return the commission you've taken, Nivin Pauly? Nivin Pauly? What's happening here? What kind of deal is this? The deal here is like this. Do it only if you want to. I don't want to! You needn't take so much trouble to get married then! As if there are no other guys in town! Troubled me unnecessarily! 'I know how to marry without your help' What? You called me a dog, right? If it's a dog, fine. Instead, if you swear at my dad, I won't let it go. Was that Nivin Pauly? No. Your @%@^#%#^.... Is that what it's called here? The cuss words won't change even if the district changes? Was it f....? Was it m............? No? New one? When I forced him, he asked me... He asked me to marry that girl then! I didn't say this for me to marry her. When I said that Joji would give a fitting reply for this, the answer that he said.... Shucks! How can I say that to you? With your mouth! Tell me! What did he say about me? He asked what job do you have other than eating up your sister's money! Usually brothers work and earn money to take care of sisters. Here, the sister is working to take care of her brother. In that way, he's saying that you are the girl in this house! Sheesh! Ittichan said that he can marry you then! Sheesh! - Then... He said that you are so fond of jack fruits, because you were born from some jack fruit plucker who came here long back. Anyway, good that it ended with this. I'll bring awesome guys for our girl. Shall I leave then? Done! It worked! Oh no! Did that broker leave? What did he say? Nothing. Tell me what's the matter. I said it's nothing. It's a problem between us men. If it's a problem between men, why are you getting tensed? Shall I pluck a jack fruit? Get lost! Damn jack fruit! It's a wiper that wiped tears of so many lives. Now its life has come to an end. Oh God! Did the Tyre just burst? That's an original gunshot! Did anyone shoot Ittichan down? Sheesh! This gunfire was just to kill these chickens? Have you heard of hunted (game) meat? Yes. Apart from hearing, have you tasted it? - No. So this shot was to get the taste of that hunted meat. And not because you're scared to kill them, right? There won't be any such trouble if you buy it from the shop, right? I should pay money for that, right? - Yes. Now I can lie that we bought our home grown chickens from outside, give it to Annamma aunty, get money, and eat it ourselves. Anyway, her children are not going to come for their father's death anniversary. Before mom comes back from Church, take these to Annamma aunty's kitchen. Okay! Hey! Can your mom identify these chickens? Why? Do these chickens have Aadhaar cards or what? Get going, you fool! Shall I shoot him down? Didn't I tell you? That we will have to eat this whole thing? All 3 children didn't come. That's good anyway. Annamma... Don't be upset. They will come after going to their friend's houses & wives' houses. Come and eat something. No. I'm really tired. Let me lie down. Please have food and go, Theyyamma. I'm not going today. I can sit here and talk to you, right? This guy... Since the younger daughter is in Mundakkayam, I had a doubt whether she would come. Alex Chettan and Ajoy are in Kochi, right? They are just one call away. Why should they fool this poor aunty like this? In a rush to make money, it's been years since they forgot their mother's happiness, and their father's death anniversary. Shall I serve one more? - Did you eat, dear? I'll eat later. - So much love! Wife is feeding the husband, husband is feeding the wife. Such love! - Hey! No point in being jealous. You need to be fortunate to bite and chew like this. Sindhu, it tastes great anyway. You stole it from your own house, right? It will be even more tasty! Gorge on it! Did you tell her? I didn't say anything. Sit there! Eat the whole thing and go! Hey! You go home with Sugunan today. I'll stay here. Eat it! Darling! What is it? Shouldn't I send her? Yes. Then eat it fast and go. One slap...!! What is it? A tooth? No. It's a pellet. Your shot is so powerful! I would have died now. That means that we've left mom alone, and that we don't bother coming, right? Not that.... You could have come with him. Xavier had gone to the plantation yesterday. To shoot a tiger down. Since we couldn't come for the death anniversary, I made Xavier pay for three Holy Qurbanas. Do you know that? Give it to me. - Mom, just a minute. Mom! It's me, Xavier. It's not like the death anniversary. We both have decided that we'll attend the midnight Qurbana for this Christmas with you! Right, dear? - Yes. Aren't you happy now, mom? She is happy. You also promised that everyone will be there. Couldn't you think that it was your father's death anniversary? If I had time, would I skip it? But Jeep's new SUV was launched yesterday, correctly. Otherwise I would have come, definitely. You could have sent Susan and your child, right? Mom is alone there, right? If they come there, who's there to serve food for him, and bathe his dog? Right? - Why don't you understand that, mom? Excuse me, sir. Customer is waiting. - I'll just come. Then, shall I? Okay then. Mom... I didn't skip it on purpose. All day yesterday, I was busy with meetings for next year's admissions. You won't understand all this, mom. Try to make her understand, Ittichan. I had told her that you are really busy! Mom struggled so much to educate you, right? So, to run such a big school, Annamma aunty would know how difficult it is. Sophie, one minute. Mom, we'll definitely come for this Christmas vacation. Tell me, Sophie. I'll send the car. Don't irritate. It's at 5 PM, right? Shall we go? - I'll reach by 4 PM. They don't have time, just to come to me. Everyone is shooting! My dear people, My dear people! Over here! I take this opportunity to thank you all for the love and support, you gave me for the past 2 years. I am really sad that I have to leave from here, before Christmas and the Church festival. At the same time, I appreciate the service of Ittimaany, the construction committee convenor, who finished the work of the new Church bell, right on time. My dear people, to hand over a memento to Ittimaany, on behalf of the parish, I invite a staunch believer, and a member of the first set of immigrant families, Mapranam Varkey. Varkey, you are being called. Me? Is it? Come. Stand here. Give it. Namaste. Give it to him. - To him? Father, shall I...? You may go! Aren't you ashamed to run there as soon as you're called? I am a staunch believer, right? How can I refuse when Father calls me? Thanking God, with everyone's permission, I am going to inaugurate the new Church bell. Please move. Here you go, Father. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit... So melodious! Not good enough! Oh my God! Jesus! Father, what happened? Father! Father! Get up, Father. - Lift him up! Father! Where's the water? Bring the water. Open your eyes, Father. Give it. - Jesus, it's my first time. Forgive me. He has come to his senses. Drink it! Drink it. Let some of it remain. You can sprinkle it later. Father, seeing blood is a good sign. But our bell broke, right? It's okay, Father. What kind of a man is he? You made a duplicate of even the Church bell & got commission, right? Oh my God! When he was assigned to do it, Varkey Chettan said... 'We have given the key to the thief' When? - You said it when you got drunk at my house. That it's made in China, and there's no guarantee! Right? - Yes. We'll let you go from here, only after giving an explanation! Stop it! This is the Church. No violence here. Move, everyone. - Then call the police, Father. Father, dismiss Ittichan from the Church committee. That's what should be done now. - Yes. What Advocate said is right. Ittichan should be dismissed. Right? Don't shout. - Shouldn't he be dismissed? Right? - Yes. That should be done! Stop! Stop! Do you have any explanations about this, Ittichan? Father, I.... What is he going to say? You are supposed to fire him from the committee, Father. Just say that! Say it, Father. Calm down! Listen to me! Since that's everyone's opinion, Ittimaany needn't continue on that post. I dissolve the committees for Christmas & the festival led by Ittimaany. Father! - Don't say anything. Let the new Vicar decide the rest. All of you, disperse. Didn't you hear Father? Disperse! What is this? Father! Father! You and your death bell! I'm lucky that I didn't die. Praise the Lord! Ittichan! Bhaskaran? - Bhaskaran escaped! Escaped? I checked the locked smithy, and his house thoroughly. He's not there. He wouldn't have gone anywhere. He must be in some bar. He's not in any bar. I checked even in the breweries. Then I tried calling him again. His mobile is ringing. That rascal didn't pick up. So I sent a couple of messages with expletives. As soon as he got it, he called me back. Then? - He is on his way to Goa. To Goa? - Yes. It was his final wish, to bathe with foreign girls in bikinis, at a Goan beach. When Joji paid him for that, he messed up the Church bell. Joji? Who's that? Ittichan! That girl's brother! That Pothen! Since you didn't marry his sister, he messed up your bell. I can't sleep peacefully because of this bell! There's no point stopping this bell, my dear son. If the people come to beat you to death for the Church bell issue, I swear on your dad, I'll run away! I will also run! After taking from everywhere, you picked even Jesus' pocket now! That's why you're suffering now. I wish that bell fell on my head, instead of this! - What? Here comes the sexton Francis. Must be to say that you've been expelled from the Church. Why has this rascal come here now? Go and talk to him! Look at him lying there! Isn't Ittichan home? Yes. There he is. The sun didn't rise here or what? Get up. I have to tell you something. What? Did someone die? Just because you own an ambulance, don't think that you'll get trips often. The new Priest came in the morning itself. Before everyone else gets him on their side, try to get him on your side. I'm lying here like this because of that bloody bell! Don't be disappointed. The new Father seems like he would listen to us. I won't have any trouble, only if you are there, Ittichan. You know, right? I have three daughters! Should I take the blame for that also now? After making three children... Now try peeping as well. Do you want to see? Manikkuttan! (Bell-boy) Manikkuttan, I'm at the Church. Call me later. It's the Qurbana. Jesus! What? What? He has come again, shameless fellow! Walking around after breaking the bell? God, please don't forgive him. I strongly sought refuge in Jesus. 'Jesus, O Messiah' Is this the bar? I need two large pegs! Slowly... Don't hold me! I am normal. You are normal. I know! Come! Mom, my hand! - Do you want a drink? I'll buy it for you. Manager! Manager, where's the counter where I can stand & drink? I'll show you now. Show him the counter where he can stand & drink! Hi bro! I just need two pegs. Two pegs! - Come, sir. I'll show you the counter. Come on! Just two pegs! Doctor, he is my only son. My dear Doctor, do whatever you have to do, and just stop his damn drinking habit! What happened to your hand? - This? I hit a foreigner at Goa. Why? He can't share his drinks, it seems! He didn't understand what I said. Shall we buy a pint and share it? - Yes. But I'll pay. - No. I'll pay. No, I'll pay. - No. I'll pay! No! I will pay it. Then you pay! Come on! This is the counter. That one? I'll go and get the cash. Come back quickly. Hey bro! Can I get a peg? Peg? Just go and join that queue. Bro, can I get a peg? One peg? It's been 2 weeks since I've been asking for a drop here! Here every day is the first of the month. (Dry day)! Saw that? Joppan, you? Don't laugh. - God! I'll die laughing today. Hey! This guy will ruin everything today. Hey! Keep it low! I am a Father now. - Father? Crap! Father Joppan? Hey! It's not Father Koppan. Father John Paul. You were always drinking shady rum. When did you become a priest? I've seen many kinds of duplicate stuff, and made them too. But this is the first time I'm seeing a duplicate priest. I'm not a duplicate priest. I am original, dude. Yeah, right! You became a priest so that you can drink wine for free, right? - Shut up! If someone else hears this.... I'll lose my honour. Move! You know how many years it's been since I stopped all my fraud jobs? Where did I go after having a change of heart, at the de-addiction centre? To the Seminary! Since there was no age limit to become a priest, I was relieved. Since I had a degree of my own, I could do a Qurbana in my 7th year. This is my 3rd parish. Please don't humiliate me. Grinning? You've come here at a great time! I am also quite humiliated. Why don't you tell the people that it was Joji who broke your bell? My own mother doesn't believe me! Then how can I? People are saying that I made a duplicate bell. You are my only hope. Me? If this was a Government job, I would have escaped from here with a transfer, the moment I saw you. So many nights we spent in a single cell, pining for a single peg! Even if you forget it, I can't forget it. So... What you said now means that you will blackmail me, right? Isn't it? - Yes. True! I will do it. - I understood that. What should I do now? I want to rejoin the Church committee. Rejoin the Church committee? Why are you so adamant to join the Church committee? Joppan! - Hey! This is my third Parish. In both the parishes I was in earlier, I was a failure. A mega failure! I need to gain a good name at least here. I'll get that done! First you make a good Church bell, and get rid of the people's anger. That's all? - Yes. You just... Father, please support me strongly. I'll play the rest of the games. My God! Wait and watch! Before leaving this Church, I'll make the people of this parish, declare you as a Saint! Saint Joppan! Saint Joppan! Ittimaany! Isn't that a bit too much? Not at all! We are going to rock here, Father. See! It's true! Praise be to the Lord! 'God bless you' You? You were expelled from the Church committee! What are you doing here? Church is not your father's....!! Hey! That Bhaskaran who escaped from town? I'll bring him back here someday. Your games will go on only until then. What's that noise of a civet crying? Who are you? Praise be to the Lord. I didn't get him. - He said 'Praise be to the Lord'. I got that. I didn't get who he is. This is the Joji I told you about. The bell... ? I need to talk to you personally, Father. - Hey! Don't think you can complain about me here. Father and I are thick friends! isn't it, Father? - Of course. I'm going to spread my branches all over this Church. You heard me, Pothen? Shall I leave then? - So be it. Shall I spread my branches? - Go ahead! Boss, move! The jack fruit will fall on your head! Jack fruits won't cheat, you idiot! Slowly! Slowly! You stand here counting jack fruits! Ittichan has gone to the Church with a new bell! Is it? - Yes. Will I get paid for saying this now? Chetta... Get all the ripe ones down. Be careful. It's a fool sitting on top. Look, there it goes. Ittichan's bell. Come! As if it's some great bell! Ambulance? - Shall we bury here, Father? - That will be great. The mud is good here. - What is it? Tell us where it should be buried. Oh no! My husband! What the hell is this? Keep it there and go. - Just hold her. God! What do I do with this? Ittichan, just raise this vestment and fold it. Father & boss are thick friends, right? - Who told you? Sitting in the back bench since 1st grade. Thick friends like that? Hey! Go and paint it. Take this. - Go! Go! Hey! What have you written? It's correct! Boss, throw this! Father! Wait! Wait! You are awesome! You shook up the whole parish as soon as you came! Is your name Varkey? - Yes. How did you know that? There will be one such guy in every parish. And all their names would be Varkey. Not good for any work! I don't think he'll leave from here properly! Stop at some good place for dinner. Father, stop this secularism and collection drive right now. Otherwise, we'll bring Bengalis who became priests from Jabalpur and make them perform Qurbanas. Will you do it? - Yes. Then I'll perform your last rites today! Scaredy cat! Ran away! This looks better than the original, man! Have some. Get some energy! - Okay! If priests get extra energy, it will be a problem. That's true. Is there a problem if I bathe using a soap? - No. You can. What's the selfie for? To put up on Facebook? Ittichan & the Father are thick friends. They will take this whole Church to China mostly. This is to be framed, in the Church's remembrance. [Inauguration of Shoot-out competition] Oh my God! Don't push! One pint! - Will a pint be enough, Advocate? Shall I get you a full bottle? - Praise be to the Lord! Yeah, right! The Vicar is here! Escape! My legs are aching. Let's go! Ittichan, stop! I didn't sit! Ittichan... Come here. We could achieve this award for the best parish, only because of Ittichan's sincere services. Damn service! So... I've decided to re-appoint Ittichan as the Church committee president. What's your opinion, Ittichan? Just because you said so, I'm not ready to accept this. But... If the entire parish has such a wish, I won't object to it either. Who wishes for it? Do you? So Ittichan will be the next Church committee president. Hey! This was a moronic decision. Varkey, if you have such an objection, you needn't sit here. You can go out. Is that so? - Yes. Come on, everyone. No one came? Congratulations! Rock it, bro! So the decision has been passed! Happy Christmas! Annamma aunty, it's me. Sainu Claus. Happy Christmas! Move! Move! Please move! You were here? Now you needn't go to Church. Give it to me. This should reach the Church! Is it original? One slap I'll give you! - Happy Christmas! Didn't you get ready yet? I'm not coming. None of them came so far, right? Try calling them. No. Let them come if they feel like seeing their mother. Is that a tiger or a monkey in front? It's a tiger's picture, but it's worn by a monkey! Shall I swallow that Pothen bro? - No! No! Stop! Stop! What? - We won't allow such tiger dance troupes to enter the Church! Why? Is the tiger an enemy of Jesus? I don't know that. But tigers aren't mentioned in the Bible. There are only little sheep in the Bible. - Yes. And it's against our canon law too! As if the Pope said that tigers shouldn't be allowed inside the Church! If you have a doubt, call him. Come on, dance! Call him and see! It's the Pope! Oh no! Pope Francis! Hello? Is it the actual Pope? Yeah, right! Crap! Pope, it seems. What is it, mom? Tell me, Ittichan. Alex, where are you? At Ajoy's house. What is it? Annamma aunty had a chest pain... and she's admitted in the ICU here. - Is it? Munnar will be really cold now. Ittichan, one minute. I'll call you back. There's a problem. - What is it, bro? Ittichan just called. Mom has been admitted to a hospital. Oh no! What happened to mom? Nothing. It's just a chest pain. Then it will be a heart attack. - Keep quiet. Bro, shall we go there? Don't be so hasty! Ajo... What do we do now? If we postpone this tour, the offer that we got now? - When will get such an offer again? The kids are all really excited! Now don't cancel the trip. Cancel the trip? For what? Mom is in the hospital! We planned this vacation thinking that everyone would be together. But now... Bro... Ask Ittichan to adjust for a couple of days. Tell me. To be frank, we're just leaving on a tour to Munnar. In between that... I'll do one thing. I'll transfer some cash to your account. For the time being, you manage everything there for a couple of days. Alex, that... Hello? Escaped from that crocodile! Oh no! What? 25% is okay, right? We'll give it, sir! I'm going to buy tea. You want some? Get lost. Don't disturb me! Have some more. Which day is it today? Friday. We came here on Monday evening. Is it? - Yes. So, I was lying here without any memory, for 3-4 days? Where are my children? It will take 2-3 more days for them to come after their tour from Munnar. But this time there's a relief. They are sending money promptly! Take it away! Wasn't it for this? - One punch I'll give you! Is this the time to say all this? Doctor has said that she shouldn't feel sad at all. I forgot that. One slap I'll give you! I'm going home now. It's been 3-4 days since I came here. Don't go anywhere to get commission. You should be here, okay? Ask those tiger dance guys to go to hell! Money for tiger dance? Hey! She's fast asleep. I'm leaving. Take care of her. Take care. Annamma aunty! What a view! Morning! - Good morning, brother-in-law! Is this also drunk? Come on, fall! What, bro? In the morning itself? Last night's hangover! Brother... - Yes. Not you! Call for you. - Who is it? I don't know. Mom? When did it happen? Don't know when. I came here as soon as I heard it. Anyway, two hours have passed. Did anyone think that this would happen? That's all human life is! The vehicle has come. He became complete only now! So this was her disease! - What? Staying unmarried! Were they already in love? - Yes. Is it? - Yes. They must have been! Stop there! My God! Why should I stay alive now? I came to know whether what I heard is true! I know you'll do any shady business for money! But still... to do such a vulgarity, what magic did she perform on you? Tell me! - Mom, my wedding garland! You and your damn wedding garland! Theyyamma... - You shut up! Don't call me that name again! You were with me always, for so long. I considered you not just as a friend, but as a sister. Enough! Even if you hear that I'm dead, don't step into my compound! Mom, please bless us! - Yeah, right! I'll bless you! Don't touch me! Move away! Scoundrel! I don't have such a son hereafter! Don't come there, claiming that. That's awesome. You too! Old age marriage! Shameless fellow! Aren't you done watching? Get out, all of you! Get lost! They have come to attend the wedding! He's talking as if we got his mom married. You're saved because this Ittimaany didn't come to your house. Otherwise, he would have married your mom! That's your sister, Advocate! Bride & groom, please stop! Aren't you ashamed to come home marrying someone who's your son's age? You have a problem only because he is younger to me? I don't have the health to marry someone older to me, and to look after him! Then... why I married him? To look after me, when I have two fully grown sons, if I get someone as a help on a payroll, people will make all sorts of gossip. In this case, no one will open their mouth. Before we throw you out of here, both of you get out. Go where? Whatever you see here... was hard-earned by Avarachayan and me! You've come to establish your ownership? Where were my children and in-laws for so long? Move away! Where are you going, Mr. Groom? Aren't you ashamed to marry your classmate's mother? Is it my fault that he was my classmate? When I failed in 8th grade twice, he reached my class. Right, Alex? What's your plan? You don't have the time or interest to look after your mother. And my wedding hasn't happened even after so many years. Moreover, I'm her neighbour too. When Annamma asked me, to marry her and enjoy the rest of our lives, and offered as much cash I want, I agreed! You know right? Money is a weakness for me. We'll get rid of that weakness! Leave me. This is not the Itti who played silly games with you in childhood. Plamoottil Annamma's husband. That means, your step-father, Ittimaany. Take your hands off me! Ittichan... Come inside. That's it! Your mom is great. You could have brought a lamp to welcome your dad and mom. If you don't like it, no need. Then, with the permission of our children and in-laws, this father is entering with my right foot. Or no need. I'll enter with my left foot. The door is closed. - Keep quiet. You guys sit here boozing! Our dear mom has started preparing for her first night. So? Should we decorate her bedroom? Leave it, bro. Don't argue. I'll go. But I'll come only after a life imprisonment. Xavier... Then no need. What happened when you met the registrar? We've been asking you ever since you came. So your mom's.... You want to know if your mom's wedding was registered? That's an interesting matter. Sir, our mom made a blunder. As if your mom is at the right age to make blunders! She's sweet 17, right? Sir, what should we do to annul this marriage? Since first client Annamma's husband is not alive, according to special marriage act, this client has the right to marry anyone of her choice. We... - So your objection...! You should keep objecting! You have the right to do that as well. Understood? This is what happened there. Advocate Tharian asked us not to do anything in haste. Otherwise, we would have solved this today itself. Only the route of law is closed, right? Let's see. Whatever said and done, this was absolutely disgraceful. How will I go back to Pala now? It's Sugunan. Let me go and see. Oh no! He's coming! Oops. To see the preparations? Since the wedding happened suddenly, Annamma couldn't go to a beautician. So I became her beautician. Ittichan! What is it? Take this. Take this. This shouldn't be missed. When you go to your room for the first night, let there be some fragrance. This is nice! I was really tensed, sitting at home. You're going to drive a '65 model Ambassador car, right? Can't say when the engine would go faulty! So it's great to have an ambulance in front of the house. Get going! - Hey Ittichan! How do you get so many second hand items? First, the scooter. Then, our ambulance. And what you got now is also second hand. - Enough. When you go, take your wife along with you. I know how to take care of my wife. How's that possible? This ambulance doesn't get any rides. If I take her back, how will I live? You can ask her to stay with my mom. For what? - If Sindhu is there, we can get live updates, right? Not for free. I'll give you something extra. When you bought it, couldn't you buy some extra? Who bought it? I took it out from the wreath on Karthu's body, from the colony. Moron! Yes, I took it from a corpse! Get lost! I won't give it. - Give it to me. Give it. Enough of your games. - Go and sit there. Wow! What a beauty! Annamma... Where did you hide this beauty for so long? Though I was right across the wall, how come I never noticed this! We should have married much earlier, right Annamma? Hey! She's shy. That's why! She's shy! Mummy, is tonight grandmother's first night? Is tonight grandma's first night? Shut up! What all do you both want to know! Don't say that. So wishing everyone a... ... bad night! Oh no! I forgot it! Oops! I forgot it! What? 'Your mom's pretty earrings' 'This father is going to steal it' 'Your mom's pretty earrings' 'This father is going to steal it' 'Your mom's pretty earrings' 'This father is going to steal it' 'Your mom's pretty earrings' Calm down! - 'This father is going to steal it' Go and sit there! Didn't any of you sleep? All of you are in the same positions! Hey Betty! Get a strong tea for your dad. Let me start the day properly! Oh God! Dad? Whose dad? At Mundakkayam, do you address your step-father as brother-in-law? Get lost. - You want tea, right? I'll make it. - That's nice. Let things happen as they are supposed to. Now you can say all your choices directly to me alone. I should be cooking for you hereafter, right? I didn't remember that. What are you looking at? Drink it fast. I should cope up, right? Nice. Did you sit on it and check? - Of course. Ask! Haven't you done enough drama already? Now do you want to humiliate us further with this road show? Why don't you have a cold drink? Get lost! This is such nonsense! Let us meditate for a moment about the Lord's words we heard today. The Lord's... Hey! The Qurbana is happening here. You can look here as well. How many years has it been since your wife died? This is the eighth year. I've never skipped the requiem so far. - Good. You light the candles. I'll come now. - Okay Father. Hey! You go ahead. I think I forgot to say a couple of prayers. Annamma aunty... This was something that's unheard of, anywhere. With your age and maturity, I never expected you to do this. You gave a speech even today that God will protect those who are alone, right? I'll say whatever comes to my mind in my speeches. But would anyone do such nonsense...? What is he doing here? We came to pray to Avarachayan. Great! Avarachan must be really happy now. I.... I... I.. Let me.... I'll sort him today. What drama are you doing here? Here! I was asking forgiveness to Avarachayan. Crap! You married his wife, came to his grave, and asked forgiveness to him? Give some peace of mind to him, at least when he's dead. If you stay here any longer, he'll break out of this grave, and hit you on your head with that slab! What magic did you perform on her, to make her agree to this? Well... What's the point knowing all that now? Just tell me... - Take off your hand. Pathetic! This is like marrying your sister, since you couldn't find a bride! Even if it's for money, I didn't think that you would be so cheap! Done? - No. What's your intention? I attended the Qurbana, prayed at the cemetery. Now I have to buy 2 kilos of beef and go home! That's the habit of us Christians, right? Not beef... This is called arrogance! Didn't that Alex and Ajoy grow up with you? They are sitting in the Church since morning. They are asking me how they will face the people here now. What should I tell them? It's true that you've done many good things for me now. But in this matter, don't expect my support. If they know that I supported this, people will bash me up. From now on, I'm a believer of this parish, and you are the Vicar. You're a believer and I'm the Vicar. That's all our relationship will be! Who are you? I am Ittichan's chef. Sainuddeen. You can call me Sainu. I was transferred here. Are all of you staying here? Wow! Now whatever you need, just ask me. I was so bored without working. Now I'll die working! Hey! Shall we do a Tik Tok video? Not interested? What about a selfie then? Selfie with a chef! Get lost! Him and his damn selfie! Bloody tadpole! It's like a ladies' hostel. Either I'll go viral on Tik Tok from here, or I'll be caught in #MeToo. This frame became balanced only now. That's true. Even when Christ was crucified, there was one each on either side. Boss! Check out my BF. Your BF? Where? - Not that BF. Beef Fry. If you have this... Ittimaany! Who's that? We'll eat it while drinking in the night. The entire Parish is here? Is it for some collection drive? No! To grab you by your neck and throw you out! Why did you have to drag Father along for that? The fight is between us, right? Ittichan, the entire Parish has objected to you accepting the Qurbana, without getting married at the Church. We came to inform that. Annamma aunty, I might be your family advocate. But I'll say what I have to say! Those who live according to their own will, without following the canon law, can be banned from the Parish. Do you know that? You will be expelled! Father... Is there any age limit to get married in the Church? No. There's no law that the bride should be younger than the groom either. No. - A widow... It's not said in canon law that a widow's wish to remarry should be stopped. Isn't that so, Advocate? Yes. Isn't it? - Yes. Then listen... Not just you all who came to separate Annamma and me, I'm saying this for your attention also, Father. On the coming 27th, on Annamma's birthday, at our Church, with all the believers and non-believers as witnesses, Manikkunnel Ittimathan's son Ittimaany... ... will marry your mother. We are going to get married at the Church. 'Be careful! You are messing with the Church!' Those were some really foul words. 'You can see my wedding at least like that, right?' He said sorry. 'Go say that to your dad!' Now she swore at his dad! What to do! Well... So you've made up your minds? - Yes. We have decided to marry. It's not enough if you decide it alone. It's about the marriage between Annamma and me. It's enough if we decide it. You... - Ajoy, don't fight. Since the people have come to know, I'll publish our wedding photo on all the newspapers. Let Annamma and me fill up the front pages! These guys, her grandchildren and in-laws can also join. A headline in full length. 'They are getting married today' No! No! 'Our mother...' 'Our mother is getting married again today' That will be awesome. Right? - Yes. If anyone has any kind of objection, you should say it now. Do you have any? - Not at all! So no one has any objection, right? Then get going. Go home! - Will you go for the wedding, Varkey? - No. - I'll go for the feast. Father! You should definitely come for the Bachelor's party on the wedding eve. For old times' sake, we can have a few drinks! Well... Has the groom come alone, or... the bride has also come? Are you planning to get married at night itself? I'm just curious. That wedding won't happen, Father. It won't happen? Then why did you announce so proudly to the people that you'll marry her at the Church? In that situation... To say that you'd marry when you feel so, and they say no, are Church matters your duplicate business or what? You won't have a problem if you don't have the Church or prayers. But it's not the case with Annamma aunty. The parish won't even allow her to be buried in the Church cemetery when she dies. Father, I ... - I am sure about one thing. If her assets worth crores become yours, you won't even hesitate to kill her. - Enough! I didn't do this seeing anyone's wealth... I didn't want anyone to know anything for the time being. Since so much has happened, you should know what happened. Then decide whether I should marry at the Church or not. The day Annamma was admitted in the hospital, I had called her children. Even after knowing that their mother had a heart attack, all three of them didn't even bother coming there. It was in that shock... that she... Again... Annamma aunty! Annamma aunty! Annamma aunty! How much? - 140/90. This was due to a sudden shock. She just survived a heart attack. If she feels sad again and things become complicated, she might even need a surgery. Prayers of some good souls! Annamma aunty came back to life. Enough? Water? Why did you save me? You should have just let me die. One slap I'll give you! If you die of a heart attack for your children, who don't want you, even God won't let you into heaven. Once our children grow up, our lives would melt into nothingness. Finally, when they reach a good stature, they don't want their fathers or mothers. Officers, it seems! You should give them tight slaps! Mom has a point. There's one way to make them stay with Annamma aunty and never leave her. What? Tell me. Annamma aunty... should get married again. One slap! What foolishness are you saying? Don't be so hasty. Listen to me first. Sit down. At this age, if their own mother marries someone, and if they know that they will lose so much wealth and money, which children won't panic? Leaving all their busy works aside, they will fall at Annamma aunty's feet. Yeah, right! While waiting for God's call, you're talking about marriage? I wasn't talking about you, Theyyamma. Get lost! Getting married again? - But who has to get married here? Just act like you got married. We can bring them under your control. It might be a plus or minus of living with my dad, my mom understood the duplicate side of what I said, rather quickly. Though it's slightly twisted, he has a point, Annamma. Let them also suffer a bit. What can we gain by punishing them like that? If they would be reformed with this punishment, they deserve that punishment. But you need to find... someone who's right for this. There is someone. There is someone like that. Who? You! Me? - Yes. You are perfect for this. I know that you'll do much more than this, if you can get money. Just because I told an awesome idea? Now you're putting all the burden on me? Isn't it for a noble cause? Moreover, it will be a penance for whatever you did so far. Come with me! Come! What? It's not like whatever I did so far... My future! You and your damn future! Theyyamma! - Shut up! My wedding? Your wedding in the future, right? I'll see to it that your wedding won't get cancelled because of this. Theyyamma, this is risky. - No risk at all. Not for free! Tell me how much money you need! If it brings her happiness, even if I have to sell my house and property, I'll pay as much money as you want! That's not necessary, Theyyamma. It is! I've done many things for money. Even for your surgery, I have taken commission quoting a price. But because of me, have your ever had tears in your eyes? Have you? No, right? Annamma aunty is like my own mother to me. Did you think that I would quote a price for these tears? I'm sure about one thing. If you show the courage to take such a decision today, it will be a warning for many children in the future. So, it's not just for you, Annamma aunty... For all the mothers who are dumped in temples and orphanages. Despite knowing that they would get only tears and pain in return, the mothers who dedicate their entire lives for their children. For them! Saying that they are not clean or good-looking, the mothers who are pushed into darkness of the backyards by rich kids. For them! Even while drawing their last breaths, the mothers who looked around to see if at least one of their children has come, and closed their eyes in disappointment. For the salvation of all such mothers... Then... for the happiness of these two mothers of mine! For this marriage, Ittichan has agreed! That was awesome! This idea of yours will uproot them! Now, before dumping the parents who raised them, every son or daughter would think twice. That's all I intended to do. I'm still not able to believe this. To be frank, it's not me, but you who should be giving Qurbanas in this Church. Jesus! What do I do now? Here. Just wear this. Wear this vestment. Let me see! - Oh no! No! No! - No? Then let it be there. Then what do I do? Shall I get you some wine then? - No! No! Don't want that too? - Then maybe a little. I'll get you a little then. This wine was brought from Italy. Here. Hold this. Let me take the glass. Here. Wine! Wine! Yeah, right! Stop there, I say! Wear your clothes. Stop, Michu! You'll get it from me. Listen to aunty. I won't stop. I won't stop. I'm fed up of this girl. - Sit here. Wear your clothes! - Give it here. Wear it. Xavier! Xavier! Before it all turns Grey, if you need one like this, go and attend a retreat. What? - What? What? What did you say? He's not going for the retreat. Don't you want one like this? Hey Betty! He doesn't want children, it seems. If you want children, take him for a retreat. So funny! As if kids are born because of retreats. If you want kids, you go attend a retreat. Hey! My boss doesn't have to attend a retreat to have kids. Here's the paper that covered the eggs. - Don't be vulgar. This is the newspaper that was used to cover the eggs. Paper that covered the eggs? Read it and see. 65 year old woman gave birth to twins. Los Angeles.... In America, a 65 year old woman who married a 40 year old man, gave birth to twins. Son... What? - Paper that covered the eggs! What? - Paper that covered the eggs! Yes, egg! Come! Come! - Paper? I read the newspaper... - Boss, don't be greedy. Paper that covered the eggs! Where is Alex? - He has gone to take our kids to the hostel. And your husband? - He went to the showroom. So he can go and come from the office, even from here, right? Sigh! When there's such a happy news, there won't be anyone here! This is the paper that covered the eggs! Hey son-in-law! Even if luck didn't favour you, it has favoured me. This is the paper that covered the eggs! What is he blabbering? Hey! It's the paper that covered the eggs! Egg! Egg! - Paper that covered the eggs? What's that? Boss! Boss! Shall I get you drumstick juice? Drumstick juice! You needn't make that juice! He has great power even otherwise, right? Not here. There's no hook to put a rope here. What kind of house is this? Why? For your boss to hang and die? Not for that! When my boss has a child, shouldn't we tie a cradle? What? So you didn't understand anything? Then, listen... In America, a 65 year old woman who married a 40 year old man, gave birth to twins. As soon as he heard that, he rushed to his wife, like a bull to its feed. Something will happen today. Leave me! Your damn joke! Alex! Leave him! - Boss! Won't I also have a desire to be a father like you and play with my kids? This is the paper that covered the eggs! Keep it. It will be useful. Paper that covered the eggs! Sheesh! Boss, if it's a boy for you, you can name him after your dad or anyone else. But if it's a girl, don't name her after your mother. - Why? Theyyamma. That name itself is so weak and old. Get lost! If I hear that you bought eggs to this house ever again! You're blaming me for buying eggs now? There's no problem if my boss sits next to your mom all the time? You..!! Get lost. - I should stop the newspaper subscription here. Chetta, please move. Hi! Jessy! Over here. - Hi! That's my brother. Hello! Oh wow! Bro! You've put on weight again! It's the jack fruit season, right? You haven't changed at all! Emily, this is my brother Joji. And my best friend also. Nice to meet you, Joji. Hello. - Namaste. Namaste. Even foreigners know about Malayali's behaviour. Who is she? She is my M.D. She came with me when I said I'm going on leave. To see our state. - Hi Madam. Welcome to God's own.... country! Nice. - Shall we go? - Yeah. Come on, let's go. - Thank you. Why didn't mom come to the airport? Mom still has that old leg pain. And she's lazy to travel. I make mutton soup for her at times. And she's sad that your wedding got cancelled. How's our hero doing? Ittimaany! I forgot to say that. He got married. Is it? Ask me whom he married. - Who is it? Plamoottil Annamma aunty. Oh God! That old lady? Yes. If you hear that story, you'll die laughing. Is it? - What did he say? Didn't I tell you about a proposal with Ittimaany? Yeah. - He got married. To a neighbour almost his mom's age. Wow! Great! Yeah right! Marrying an old hag is great? MD, it seems. But I don't understand why he did this. For money! What else? Just imagine his mother's situation. After calling her Annamma for so long, now she has to call her 'daughter-in-law'. Oh God! Annamma's children's case is even worse. They have to address their classmate as dad. But he's not at all arrogant about it. Jessy, this is amazing! Fantastic! Ittichan! How was your honeymoon? Awesome? We've been waiting for long, Xavier. You said someone will come, right? He is on his way, bro. He will reach now. I'll tell you something. If that Ittichan plans on staying there, I'll go to my house with my child. He is coming. Hello. This is the person I was talking about. I came to know only now that Ittichan has an enemy in this town, whom we weren't aware of. This guy? I understood that you expected a goon for hire, with a scar on the face, chewing ****** & having a shady look. But that doesn't matter. Sit down. Sit down? How can you all sit down in this situation? I got shocked when I heard that Itti married your mom. When I thought that he can't have a bigger disaster in his life, I felt happy and burst crackers too. When I saw him turning you all into real losers, and having a ball with your wealth worth crores, I couldn't bear it. That's why I came here with one call from Xavier. Since he has said that he will marry her at the Church, Since he has said so? He will marry her! He's the kind who would drown a tortoise to death in water. We're scared whether we'd be humiliated even more. What more can happen? Well, what she's saying is that... Both of them are eating and sleeping together, right? What if some mistake happens in between that...? You mean, she'll die? Not that. Gas problem? Not that. Just come, Joji. One minute. - Let us discuss. Three in one! Has he gone crazy? Sorry! I can understand your grief. But I can't stop laughing! You should pick a thorn with a thorn. And a missile with a missile. You guys studied in English medium schools. So your ideas won't be like mine, since I studied in a Government school. I learned how to write, by writing 'Thara' (Local). L-o-c-a-l. Who is this in the night? Who is it? Oh no! 'It's me!' It was you? - Yes. I'm coming. Come. What is this attire? I got scared! Couldn't you tell me before coming? - When I feel like seeing you, I'll come in many attires. It's not me. She's snoring too much! She starts it as soon as she sees the sleeping mat. You're watching this movie again? This is fun. To be frank, when I see this Jackie Chan, I'm reminded of your dad, Mathan. Mom! Not in that way! And when I watch this movie, I remember our life in China. Sigh! Those were the good old days! Did you eat anything? - Yes. There's banana fry & beef curry. Beef curry at night? Don't you want it? - Then I'll have some. Here. - Enough. Do you feel that you are alone now? Are you sad? Then I'll stop this whole thing. Why should I be sad? If I have to go to Mathachayan suddenly, won't he ask me? 'Why did you leave our son alone, without getting him married?' The love that you show him... I don't think dad has that towards you. Otherwise, for the past 10-20 years, why wouldn't he call you there? Only after I marry a girl, and after you play as much as you want with little Ittimaanis, dad will call you there. Otherwise, I'll teach your Jackie Chan a lesson! Look! Spring onion soup is my specialty. Shall I get you a glass? - No. No? Well, should I help you? Come on, then. Look at you flirting! Wherever I go, there are only chaste girls. Xavier, come fast! Oh no! What? What happened? - Mom! Mom, he... We understood your problem. Didn't you understand now that he's not fit to be let into the house, mom? Don't talk nonsense. - You can do it, right? Saying it aloud is a problem? We understood your intention of coming to this house, by fooling mom, only now. There are a couple more good looking girls here, right? - Stop it! Don't touch him. - Ittichan! Let go of him. What is she saying? What did I do? Mom! I went this way to take bath. That's when he... I was sitting there reading a Chinese book. Yeah right! Reading books in front of the ladies' bathroom? Annamma, I... I don't want to gain anything, by hurting my children's feelings. Let's end this. Annamma aunty... I haven't believed what she said. But still... To justify you, how can I go against my children? You thought you could enjoy all the wealth alone, right? Now what happened? Ittimany, our father! While leaving, give him the money for 2 drinks at least, bro. What if he says that we cheated him? Hey! You shouldn't step inside this compound ever again! We'll decide whether to look after mom or not. Hey! We're going to build a tall wall in front of the house. Get going! Why are you looking at me like this? I won't give it. These Chinese guys are so funny! Oh God! Oh no! Oh no! Someone help me. - Betty! What happened? - Someone come fast! Xavier, come fast. Oh no! - What happened? Brothers, come fast. Xavier! Did you understand what this is for? For making her do such a disgusting thing. You and your trick from the black & white age. Aren't you ashamed? Using your own wife? Shucks! Learn to respect women first. He was born to ruin the name of people in Pala. But what you did was so wrong. You can say or do everything else. But a girl should never play with her own honour. Hello! This dad will decide everything in this house hereafter. Children and in-laws, will obey me. Boss, my stolen good. I am the eye-witness. Though what you did was atrocious, since that atrocious act came of use, I'm forgiving you now. If I hear that you recorded videos of my children ever again, you know what happened to the monk in Trivandrum, right? I was thinking... - What? Shall we start a business in partnership? Hey! I was asking Maya to stop singing and start working. Did you send the Ayurveda soaps to Kayamkulam? - By tomorrow. A load of cashews was sent to Kollam. Should I call it back? Hello? Swami, the soap will reach you tomorrow. Promise. Since I was busy with the wedding, I was away for a few days. The load will reach tomorrow evening. - Is it? When? I'll reach now. I had wished so badly to take him in the ambulance. What? - Advocate Tharian? He's dead. He is dead. When? - Now. They called for the ambulance. Only if someone dies, I can be steady. 'When death approaches, I will come to you with an ambulance' Why did you take my dear brother away so quickly? I can't bear this. He was my only brother! What's this? A movie in a dead man's house? His last wish was to keep his body for public display inside the court. But they don't allow corpses in there, right? So, we've created an ambiance of the court here... Isn't it good? Sugunan, how did the advocate die? Even though he's an advocate, he went to the court for the first time yesterday. As soon as the judge said, 'Yes, proceed', he fell on the floor unconscious. He died on the spot. Sad! - Do you want ice cream? No. I'll eat it after I come back. - Okay. Where were you, Ittichan? The corpse has been waiting so long. Is it? - Yes. Ice cream? Hey! One chocobar! [Prayers] Come, let's go. They've come to humiliate us here too. We are leaving! Go ahead. I will come. Why did you have to bring her to this dead man's house? He was her family advocate, Father. When she said that she wanted to see him one last time... But this was a little too much! [Continues the prayers] Advocate was younger to Tresya, right? No. Uncle was elder to mom. Okay, Annamma aunty. Get the red & yellow one. Let's make it colourful. Jesus! It's a procession of troubles! Emma, that's Ittimaany. Hi Ittimaany. She is our hospital's MD. Hi. I'm Emily. Jessy told me all about you. Really, you're a fantastic person. Go ahead. They're about to take the corpse. Come, let's go. - Okay. Ittichan should be... - Hey! Were you trying to woo my wife? No way! I was asking if the Benz had good mileage. Of course! It has great mileage and pick-up! Do you want to do a test drive? One minute. You are so thick skinned, Itti. Aren't you ashamed to marry a woman your mother's age? My mom was lucky that you didn't come to my house. Otherwise what would have happened to my mom? Mom has leg pain too. - Hey Pothen! Xavier and you tried to trap me in a molestation case, and it was poor Betty who got slapped. I gave Xavier his share. Now don't ask for your share. Wait. I'm not supposed to say this at a dead man's house. But I can't help but say it. 'Your sister is really beautiful' You swore at me, right? No, dude. Not like how I saw in the video. Your sister is a super hot chick. Whatever Advocate Tharian told you is right. What can we do now? Tell us, Advocate. According to Christian law of succession, the children lawfully have the rights, only over the wealth that their parents have inherited as part of lineage. The entire wealth has been written in your mom's name, along with an affidavit that says that the entire wealth was hard earned by your father himself. In that case, according to your mother's wish, she can give it to Ittichan, or some orphanage, she can write it in anyone's name. Isn't it him? Hello! If you're paid money, you'll marry any old hag. Right, Ittichan? Yes, Usman. If you pay me money, I'll marry Jameela Thatha. So you can call a honourable man, your father! There's a bigger problem happening inside. See you later. Didn't you start boozing? Usually, boozing is common in such scenes. That's why I asked. Why did you ask me to come? I'll tell you. To back out from this wedding, how many Lakhs do you need? So you're bargaining, right? - Yes. Your goal is also money, right? So we'll put a price for you. Put a price for me? So along with GST and everything, how much would it be? Just to know the current market rate. How much would it be? Hey! - Don't argue, bro. Ittichan, we are ready for anything. Okay. How much will you be able to pay? Boys, if she has a heart attack, your mother will be ....!! Then, who will be the owner of all this wealth? Who? Who? - Not that. Who are you? I am their advocate. Advocate Jerry D'Culla. Jerry D'Culla. Waiting till their mother dies... Won't it be difficult for a scamster like you? It is to get the whole thing, right? Otherwise, why would anyone climb on a headless coconut tree? I shall go. Annamma should say that she doesn't need me. If you can, give her some love, and try that way. Instead, don't think that I would leave my wife stranded on the streets, getting scared of your threats. How can you go like that? You'll go only after reaching an agreement about this. Otherwise, will you hit me? I can do even that, if the need arises. I run institutions in Kochi and Kottayam, because I have contacts with goons for hire and other set-ups. If you want to do something, you need the support of 3-4 people behind you. I don't need that. 'God! Save me from being beaten up by these guys!' Understood? Davidetta! 2 beers. Chilled! Give it to these boys! Let them cool down! The ball is in his court now. Before he hits a goal, it's better that you hit a self goal. Dad! What is it? - Dad! Dad! You weren't swearing at my dad, right? No, dad. I was calling you dad. What is this, dad? - This? We have a 90 cent property in Thrissur town, right? I'm thinking of selling that and buying a helicopter. Isn't this bigger? So we can go flying to the Church and to buy meat, right? Take it inside and play, son. Go! Go! Go! Well... We've realized our mistake. We? - Yes. Over here. Come. We are going to love dad. You realized my value at least now, right? Xavier was talking about our own dad. We couldn't attend dad's 25th death anniversary, right? Though late, we've decided to conduct it in a big way. When she sees us loving the dead father, mom will start loving us. When her love for us increases, she would think that she won't need this dad anymore, naturally. Then I will leave from here happily. Did Annamma agree? - We will convince her. You don't have any objection, right? No. Leave me. If what you told now was sincere, once this death anniversary function is over, I will scoot from this marriage. Isn't that enough? Thanks, dad. Enough, man! By calling me 'Dad, Dad' so many times like this... don't ruin your dad's name! Okay? Go! Mom! Why has everyone come together? You should forgive us, mom. Please forget everything that happened in the past. Tell me what you came for. Mom, we couldn't attend dad's death anniversary, right? So we've decided to conduct the function, in a grand way, inviting everyone. Don't say no, mom. For the past many years, you didn't have time for all this, right? Now, in this matter, not just in this matter, in everything, I can't make a decision alone here. Mom, we spoke to Ittichan. Come. Ittichan... They have a wish. To conduct Avarachayan's death anniversary in a grand way. What's your opinion? If that's your wish, it's my wish too! Then, I have one more wish. That day, Theyyamma should also be here. Is that necessary? Yes. - We promise to bring Theyyamma aunty. Bringing her is good... That old lady shouldn't talk nonsense to me? Okay? Done! We'll take care of all that. We will never let our mom be alone hereafter. We will take care of you royally from now on. Hey! 'You made them conduct the death anniversary themselves! Great job!' 'Shouldn't we do at least this much for Annamma aunty?' Take her away! Come, let's go. Seems like they are fighting in Chinese language. No. Not fighting. - Do you know Chinese? Chinese... I don't know. A Father who doesn't know Chinese! How can you conduct Qurbanas in the Church, Father? So, do you know Chinese? - I don't know. I'm not a Father, right? So sad! Get lost! - Theyyamma aunty! I understood how you both acted brilliantly in Chinese language. Ittichan already told me everything. Ittichan has told me about your old stories as well, Father. Oops. Go and have some duck curry. Carry on! Mom, have some of that chicken fry. How is it? How is it? - What meat is this? Chicken! It's a function of 1500 chickens! I twisted the necks of 100 of them & killed them. What did you do for the rest? - I gave poison to them. It won't come. I've added tablets to stop vomiting too. Then it's fine. Give him two more pieces. How's the curry, mom? - Everything is nice. Give some to him too. This is a consent letter for annulling the marriage. If Ittichan signs it, mom will also sign it, right? - Of course. Right now, mom will sign wherever we want her to. His nuisance would end today, right? Then the old hag's arrogance will also end. We have to make her answer for all that she did so far, after that. Hey! The Advocate is calling you. I'll be right back. Mom! Oh no! What happened, mom? Have some water. Mom! Mom! What happened? Give her some water. - Xavier... Here's the water. Didn't you say that you added tablets to stop vomiting? No way! Don't get me beaten up now. Move! Move! What is it? - What are you all watching? Move! - They went inside. I saw that. - What is it? What is it, Xavier? - I'll also come. - Move. Get lost! What happened? What is it? What happened? I don't know if it's the food. It suddenly felt like a catch. I knew it when you decided to use his catering service, that something like this would happen. Mother Mary! I hope no one dies on such a nice day! Mom, I will... Annamma aunty, shall we go to the hospital? No. I'll be all right now. Anyway, your children and in-laws are loving you to bits. That's their trick to get rid of me, mom! It might be. But still... it's only because you forced me to take such a decision then, that all my children came to me now, and I could be happy like this. Once the misconceptions are cleared today, they will love their mother. That's what I also thought. But they still need to change. So... There's one more sample firework from Ittichan for them. What happened? What happened to mom? Theyyamma aunty! - What happened to mom? Theyyamma aunty... What happened, Theyyamma aunty? Ask him! - Wait. Ittichan... What happened? What happened, Ittichan? Playing hide & seek? To our house... - To our house? A baby is going to come! Oh no! - Awesome! Mom! Hey Betty! I knew it when you went with the paper that covered the eggs. Shouldn't we tie a cradle? - You devil! Anyway, you won the Formula One, driving that old Ambassador car! Hey! Hey Alex! There's a small twist in the climax. In such a situation, how can I abandon my wife? So... I'm not scooting right now. - You!! Leave him! Take your hands off! - Ittimaany! Sit down. I'll get you some water. Leave him! Get lost, you dog! - I won't fall. You and your father drama! Get out of here today! I will kill you! - Ajo! No! - Coming to our house and... Don't spare him, Ajo. - Ittichan! Ajo, Alex, what is this? Leave him! - Move away, you old hag! Move! Annamma... In the present situation, there's no other solution than a heart surgery. My God! If you had brought her as soon as she started vomiting, it wouldn't have been so complicated. One of the close relatives should sign the consent letter. Whatever it is, make it fast. Why are you standing like this? Go and sign it! What is it, mom? A consent letter needs to be signed, if the surgery has to be done. They are not going to sign. You go! Mom, how can I? He will hesitate. If the old lady dies, wealth worth crores will come to him, right? He won't sign. I would have signed. I would have done it without anyone telling me to. If I had married Annamma aunty! So you kept my mom with you without marrying her? - You...!! Give him one tight slap on his face! - Ittichan, leave him. Leave him, I say. - No! He's waiting for his own mother's death... Better than slapping him... Move. Alex! If that life which is suffocating inside, comes to an end, how many ever times you confess, you can't wash off the stains of that sin! Remember that! He did all this so that Annamma aunty would get some love from all of you! And unlike what you think, Annamma aunty didn't marry him in this old age, because she was tempted. Do you remember? Despite being informed that your mother was on her death-bed, those days that you guys went to booze and celebrate! Annamma aunty! There's one way to make them stay with Annamma aunty and never leave her. If at least one of you had looked after your mother, I wouldn't have had to do this. If you ask me whether there was only this way for Annamma aunty to get your love.. I didn't do it thinking about its right or wrong. Along with the mothers who are thrown into orphanages, without anyone to look after them, Annamma aunty shouldn't be there. That's all I wished for. After many years, you and her would be in Annamma aunty's position. Only when your own children kick you and leave you behind, you will understand the seriousness of the mistake you're doing today. When your father died 25 years ago, Annamma aunty could have married someone else and lived happily. Without doing that then, she raised you, educated you and made you reach these positions, and that mother is waiting for your mercy inside. Once they grow old, people will become ill. Some people would even defecate wherever they are lying. Which parent wouldn't wish their own children to be by their side, in such trying times? While carrying children like you in our wombs for 10 months, we've also suffered much more difficulties and pains! If we had considered it as a burden then, and walked with some force, none of you would have seen the face of this earth! There's no point in saying this to them, Ittichan. They want their mom's wealth, not her love. Why does Annamma aunty need her wealth in this old age? Annamma aunty has registered her entire wealth in all your names. He is the witness. Aren't you all happy now? Then get going! That poor thing is lying there with the confidence that I'll be there in her son's position, even if none of you are there! Ittichan... - Since all the wealth has become yours... Even if she comes back alive, Annamma aunty won't have a place in that house. But as long as I'm there, Annamma aunty won't be orphaned. I'll take her and look after her royally! Or if her fate is to die here, no one needs to stay to claim rights to that. I will bury her at the cemetery. Even while calling Annamma aunty as Annamma, I was happy that, that name had an Amma (mother). Do you know that? We made a mistake thinking that they would have a change of heart, mom! Okay. Ittichan... In between all the rush... What rush? Once they die, everyone would be right in front. To cover their fathers or mothers in granite or marble and show their pride. If you sit next to them a serve them a handful of rice, while they are alive, there's that smile that blooms on their faces. Seeing that is the biggest fortune, right? Don't they deserve at least that much? The biggest fortune is to get children who have a conscience. I got that. I'm sad that I couldn't get him married. Let Annamma get cured and come back. We'll get you married on the date we fixed! I didn't know that! You'll know once you get married! Wait, dear. Your Sari got wrinkled sitting in the car. Is he still angry? This was my revenge, Ittichan. Revenge? I made up my mind the day you rejected my sister, because of the money. When Father asks for her consent, she will say that she doesn't want you! Hey Pothen! You go! Since I knew that you'll burst a bomb like this, I have a small firecracker with me as well. Bhaskaran, whom you sent to Goa. So what's the plan? Shall we fix the marriage? Of course! You are awesome, brother-in-law. You are the right one to marry my sister. Varkey Chetta, shall we go inside? Since I'm the broker of this wedding, don't try to back out saying that you didn't get dowry or commission. Alex... Here. It's a blank cheque. Write as much as you want! I don't need all that. - Ittichan... Take it. - It won't be right. It's a blank cheque. Don't be foolish. I forgot that. Since Ittichan's Aadhaar card & PAN card are not linked, he'll take it in cash. This Ittichan. I'll en-cash it. The bride is waiting for the betrothal. Go! Go! When did you lose the greed for money? In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen! Manikkunnel Ittimathan & Theyyamma's son Ittimaany, of this Parish, do you take Thekkeppadathu Joseph & Tresyamma's daughter Jessy as your wife? I do. Poor thing. Thekkeppadathu Joseph & Tresyamma's daughter Jessy, do you take Ittimaany as your husband? Why wouldn't she! Jessy... Do you take him? Shall I return the cheque? - Why is she silent? What happened? If you don't agree, you can say that too. [Speaks in Chinese/Mandarin] What did he say? He said 'I love you'. Do you take him? I do! 'I love you' You're going to start a new life, right? Now don't go around taking commissions, and bring disgrace to her. Now we'll go together to take commissions! Right? Is that necessary? Yes. Ittichan should continue taking commissions. Since Ittichan married you, Annamma got everyone back. We are happy. But does that mean that Ittichan can marry all of us? So, to look after us, Ittichan should continue taking commissions. All the commission that he got so far, he gave it to these mothers, and never took anything in return. Who said I haven't taken anything in return? All your love... I'm getting it, right? I just had a duplicate marriage with Annamma aunty. What to do! I am 'Made in China', right? Right, mom? That's not the case with mothers abandoned by their children. If they take such decisions, the arrogance of their children would end then and there. But they won't do that. Fearing that their children would feel sad or humiliated, they will suffer everything, and spend an entire lifetime in tears, and then just pass on. I'm not asking you to do it every day. You can spend at least a little time with your mother, when you get time. If you don't have the time to do even that, I will get her married for real! With him! Pothen bro! That's a lottery! Are all of you leaving? I just turned off the light since it's my first night. We need some energy, right? Shall we have some lime juice?
