IN HIS OWN GRANDIOSE WAY, SHAKESPEARE WAS A WRITER OF NARROW SCOPE. THE COMMON MAN WAS OFTEN INCIDENTAL TO HIM. TODAY'S FINAL ESSAY WILL SPEAK TO THE CONTEMPORARY HERO AND HOW HE DIFFERS FROM SHAKESPEARE'S. ARE HEROES TODAY STILL HAMSTRUNG BY CLASS DISTINCTION, OR DO THEY WALK AMONG US, UNHEARD AND UNSUNG? IN YOUR READING ASSIGNMENT ON IAGO TONIGHT, CONSIDER THIS QUESTION: THERE WAS THIS AMAZING DISCUSSION IN SHAKESPEARE TODAY COMPARING NIXON TO IAGO. THAT CLASS HAS GOTTEN BETTER AND BETTER EVERY WEEK. COOL. SO... YOU'RE DOING OKAY IN IT? I'M ACING IT, ACTUALLY. REALLY? MM-HM. ARE YOU SURE? JOHN... I WAS DOING LAUNDRY THE OTHER DAY... AND I FOUND YOUR CALC TEST. YOU TOLD ME YOU GOT A B- ON IT.

YEAH, HOME-COOKED MEAL EVERY NIGHT. YOU ARE SUCH A GROWNUP. THANK YOU. I DEBATED WHETHER TO TELL YOU THIS TONIGHT, BUT YOU HAVE TO REGISTER FOR SPRING CLASSES SOON, AND WHAT I HAVE TO SAY WILL AFFECT THAT. YOU FLUNKED THE FINAL, JOHN, AND SINCE THAT WAS ONE-HALF OF YOUR FINAL GRADE, TECHNICALLY, YOU FAILED THE COURSE. I KNOW, IT MUST COME AS A BLOW. I KNOW HOW HARD YOU'VE WORKED.

HI, YOU ASKED TO SEE ME? AH, YES, THE NEW FATHER. HOW'S THAT GOING? JUST FINE, THANK YOU. I'VE BEEN GOING OVER YOUR TRANSCRIPT, JOHN. WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO RISK CALCULUS AGAIN? BECAUSE IT'S RECOMMENDED FOR BUSINESS SCHOOL, AND THAT'S WHERE I'M HEADED. BUT I SEE HERE THAT, UM... PROFESSOR KOWAL SUGGESTED YOU DROP IT. THAT WAS HIS OPINION, NOT MINE. I DON'T WALK AWAY FROM SOMETHING JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE TELLS ME TO. I LEAVE ON MY OWN TERMS. COME WITH ME, JOHN. I HAVE A MEETING ACROSS CAMPUS. YOU ENJOY A CHALLENGE, JOHN? YOU RISE TO IT? ALWAYS. EVEN THE MIGHTIEST LION DOES NOT ATTACK THE ELEPHANT. WHY IS THAT? BECAUSE THE ELEPHANT'S TOO BIG. THE LION KNOWS HE CAN'T WIN. PRECISELY. KNOW YOUR LIMITATIONS. THEY DEFINE YOU AS MUCH AS YOUR TALENTS. SO DROP CALC. THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING? I'M SAYING WALK AWAY NOW AND IT CAN'T HURT YOU. IS THAT WHAT YOU DID? I'M SORRY? YOU HAVE A PHD IN PHYSICS. THAT TOOK, WHAT, FIVE YEARS TO EARN? SIX, ACTUALLY. SIX YEARS, AND IN ALL THAT TIME, THERE WAS NEVER A THEORY THAT BAFFLED YOU OR A PROBLEM THAT YOU COULDN'T SOLVE? WELL, OF COURSE THERE WAS. DID YOU FACE YOUR LIMITATIONS AND WALK AWAY, OR DID YOU WORK HARDER BECAUSE YOU WANTED IT SO BAD, AND YOU KNEW THE ANSWER WAS SOMEWHERE IN YOUR HEAD? I DID STUMBLE, YOU'RE RIGHT, BUT IT WAS NEAR THE FINISH LINE, NOT AT THE START OF THE RACE. IT DOESN'T MATTER. EITHER WAY, YOU HAVE TO GET BACK UP. THANKS FOR YOUR ADVICE, DEAN FROST, BUT I'LL BE BACK IN PROFESSOR KOWAL'S CLASS TOMORROW. FRONT ROW. THE TALE OF THE LION AND THE ELEPHANT. WHAT A CROCK. YOU KNOW, ANY LION WORTH HIS SALT WOULD SCOPE OUT THE OLDEST ELEPHANT IN THE HERD, AND WAIT TILL HE FELL ASLEEP, AND YOU BET YOUR BUTT THERE'D BE DUMBO FOR DINNER. AM I RIGHT? OF COURSE I AM. NOT THAT DADDY WOULD EVER, EVER HURT AN ELEPHANT, OKAY, BECAUSE THEY'RE GENTLE AND INTELLIGENT CREATURES. YOU REMEMBER THAT, AND BE KIND TO ANIMALS. THANKS FOR LISTENING.

WHY DON'T YOU SIT AT HOME ALL DAY, EVERY DAY, AND SEE IF YOU STILL THINK THAT. KATH, DON'T DO-- DON'T DO THIS. I'VE GOT TO GO PICK UP ADAM-- NO, LEAVE HIM AT BEV'S. HEY... WHATEVER IT IS, WE'LL FIX IT. YOU CAN'T FIX A BABY! YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE. ALL I DO IS WAIT FOR YOU TO GET HOME. I HAVE YOUR SCHEDULE MEMORIZED SO I KNOW EXACTLY WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO WALK THROUGH THE DOOR, 'CAUSE THAT'S WHEN MY LIFE BEGINS. IT'S THE FIRST TIME I GET TO SEE MY KID SMILE. THAT'S CRAZY. ADAM LOVES YOU. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. HAVE I LET YOU DOWN SOMEHOW? - NO, OF COURSE NOT. - DON'T YOU TRUST ME? IT'S NOT ABOUT TRUST! WHAT, THEN? KATH, ANSWER ME. [QUIETLY]: I TRAPPED YOU. WHAT? I GOT PREGNANT ON PURPOSE, OKAY? I TRAPPED YOU. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. WELL, IT'S TRUE. I KNEW YOU'D DO THE RIGHT THING AND MARRY ME. HOW DO YOU KNOW IT WASN'T MY IDEA TO GET YOU PREGNANT? I WAS SCARED OF LEAVING BOISE, SCARED OF LOSING YOU. MAYBE I GOT YOU PREGNANT TO KEEP US TOGETHER. SEE? I CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON YOU TO SAY SOMETHING AMAZING LIKE THAT, JUST LIKE I COULD COUNT ON YOU TO MARRY ME. KATH, NONE OF THIS MATTERS. HOWEVER WE GOT HERE, WE'RE A FAMILY NOW-- NO! YOU AND ADAM ARE A FAMILY. I'M JUST THE GIRL WHO PUTS THE GLASSES ON THE WRONG SHELF! WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN? YOU EARNED HARVARD, OKAY? I-I DON'T BELONG HERE. I SCHEMED MY WAY IN! HERE'S AN IDEA. WHY DON'T YOU STOP THINKING ABOUT YOURSELF? THAT'S NOT FAIR! AND RUNNING AWAY IS? I'M NOT RUNNING AWAY, I'M GOING HOME! I THOUGHT MY DREAMS WERE THE SAME AS YOURS, BUT... THEY'RE NOT. I MADE A HUGE MISTAKE, JOHN. MAYBE THAT'S SELFISH. I DON'T CARE ANYMORE. I CAN'T PRETEND. THAT'S YOUR DREAM, HUH? TO TAKE AWAY MY SON? TO BREAK MY HEART, THAT'S YOUR DREAM? NO. OF COURSE NOT. I'M GOING HOME, JOHN. OKAY? AND I'M LEAVING ADAM WITH YOU. NO... I'M SORRY. THERE'S NO MOON TONIGHT. IT'S LOWER IN THE SKY. YOU WEREN'T LOOKING HARD ENOUGH. DO YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHY I'M GOING BACK? I THINK I DESERVE THAT. IT WAS ADAM'S BLUE BUNNY. I FOUND IT IN BED TODAY, AND IT WAS LIKE THIS GIANT REVELATION, LIKE A BOMB WENT OFF IN MY HEAD. YOU SLEPT WITH OUR SON'S FAVORITE TOY, AND I DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER TO PACK IT. ONE OF US JUST ISN'T A PARENT, JOHN. ONE OF US IS STILL A PROM QUEEN. KATH, THAT'S NOT TRUE. YOU'RE A GREAT MOM-- NO. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEFEND ME. I KNOW THE TRUTH. I'VE GROWN UP THAT MUCH. I WANT TO GO HOME. I MISS MY CROWN. AND IT'S ONLY IN BOISE? YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY SURE? BEDROOM CLOSET, SECOND SHELF, RIGHT BEHIND MY POM-POMS. OKAY, JUST... MAKE SURE YOU SERVE HIM HIS CEREAL WARM, OKAY? OH, AND YOU CAN GET HIM THOSE... THOSE EXTRA-SOFT UNDERSHIRTS AT, UM... GOD... I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE STORE. THE LIST, KATHY, IT'S ON THE LIST. RIGHT. RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, THE LIST. CEREAL WARM, UNDERSHIRTS SOFT, GOT IT. LADY, IT'S TIME TO GO. HERE. SEE HOW HE LOVES YOU? STAY. PLEASE STAY. [BABY CRYING] YOU AND ME, BUDDY... RIGHT TO THE END. I'M NOT GOING TO LIE TO YOU. I'M SCARED. IT'S JUST US GUYS NOW, AND WE GOT TO STICK TOGETHER AND WATCH EACH OTHER'S BACKS. BE A REAL FAMILY. I'M HOPING I CAN COUNT ON YOUR COMPLETE COOPERATION. ARE YOU ON BOARD? I'LL TAKE THAT AS A YES. SHE LEFT YOU? SHE WAS HOMESICK. AND YOUR SON? WITH ME. OH, MY. IT'S OKAY, WE'RE MANAGING. NOT IN CALCULUS, I'M AFRAID. I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THE NUMBER OF A GRAD STUDENT. HE'S A TUTOR, AND HE KNOWS THE MATERIAL VERY WELL. SIR, I... I CAN'T AFFORD A TUTOR. NOT TO WORRY. LAST TIME I CHECKED, HARVARD'S ENDOWMENT WAS ALMOST 26 BILLION. I THINK THAT'LL COVER IT. I'LL EXPECT REPAYMENT, OF COURSE... A PASSING GRADE. ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU, PROFESSOR KOWAL. I'LL DELIVER, I PROMISE. I'M AFRAID YOU'LL HAVE TO, JOHN. THE ALTERNATIVE IS GRIM. HEY, HOW'D IT GO? OOH! SHH, SHH, SHH... YOU MUST HAVE MAGICAL POWERS. HE NEVER NAPS IN THE AFTERNOON. OH, IT WASN'T ME, IT WAS THE SONG. "WHEELS ON THE BUS." ONE CHORUS, AND IT WAS DREAMLAND. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. "THE WHEELS ON THE BUS"? NOW OFFICIALLY MY FAVORITE SONG. [CHUCKLES QUIETLY] THANKS, BEV. YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST STUDENT THAT KOWAL'S SENT TO SEE ME. EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE WHEN I'M HERE WITH YOU, BUT PROFESSOR KOWAL PUTS IT IN A TEST, I BLANK. YOU KNOW, I'M FINE IN ALL MY OTHER COURSES, TOO. I'M EVEN ACING ECON. IT'S DRIVING ME NUTS. WE ALL FALL SHORT SOMEWHERE. CALC BULLIES ME. YOU KNOW, I SEE IT COMING, AND I GET CLAMMY AND WEAK. IT'S LIKE... IT'S LIKE KRYPTONITE. OKAY, SUPERMAN, TRY NUMBER 16. ALL RIGHT. [BABY FUSSING AND COOING] REASON #63 WHY WE MISS MOMMY-- NO CLEAN CLOTHES. HEY, YOUR UNCLE JAKE'S GOING TO BABYSIT YOU TODAY. DADDY'S GOT A BIG TEST. I KNOW, BUD, I KNOW. IT'S-- AH! DAMMIT... THUMBTACK. REASON #64. [KNOCK ON DOOR] THANK GOD. AH, HEY, JOHN, IS THIS A GOOD TIME? I-I WAS JUST GOING OUT, ACTUALLY. YOU KNOW WHAT? WE CAN COME BACK LATER, WHENEVER'S CONVENIENT. CONVENIENT FOR WHAT? TO SHOW THE PLACE. I'M SORRY, JOHN, YOU GOT THE NOTICE, DIDN'T YOU? NO, TIM, I DIDN'T. I CAN'T AUTHORIZE MARRIED HOUSING FOR A SINGLE MAN. THE RULES ARE VERY CLEAR. WHAT ABOUT FAMILY HOUSING? ADAM AND I ARE A FAMILY. THE RULES STIPULATE-- BREAK THE RULES. JOHN, YOU'RE NOT HEARING ME OUT. YOU HAVE OPTIONS. I CAN RELEASE THE SCHOLARSHIP FUNDS THAT GO TO MARRIED HOUSING, AND YOU CAN FIND AN APARTMENT. I CAN'T FIND A CLEAN SHIRT. THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T GET YOUR NOTICE. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO CHECK MY MAILBOX. YOU'RE OVERWHELMED. I'M RAISING A CHILD! AND MAYBE FLUNKING OUT. THE LAST TIME WE TALKED, YOU HAD A WIFE TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR BABY. NOW YOU'RE A SINGLE FATHER. THE STAKES ARE HIGHER, AND THE RULES HAVE CHANGED. IT'S NOT ABOUT RULES, IT'S YOU. YOU JUST PLAIN DON'T LIKE ME. THAT WAS CLEAR FROM THE START. YOU THINK I'VE CHEATED SOME OTHER DESERVING GUY OUT OF HIS HARVARD SHOT. I THINK YOU HAVE A CHILD, AND CHILDREN SHOULD COME FIRST. MY SON IS MY LIFE. I WON'T FAIL HIM... AND I WON'T FAIL CALCULUS. I BELONG HERE. I MAY BE A BUMPKIN FROM BOISE, BUT I EARNED HARVARD AS MUCH AS YOU DID, AND I WON'T WALK AWAY FROM IT JUST TO ACCOMMODATE YOUR NARROW STANDARDS. I TOLD YOU ONCE BEFORE, I LEAVE ON MY OWN TERMS, AND WHEN I DO, I'M TAKING A HARVARD DIPLOMA WITH ME. NO, WE'RE DOING JUST FINE. ADAM'S GREAT. PLUS MY FRIEND JAKE'S HELPING OUT WITH BABY-SITTING, SO... SO WHEN'S KATH DUE BACK, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA? NO, NO, NOTHING IMPORTANT, JUST, YOU KNOW, CHECKING IN. TELL HER I CALLED, OKAY? AND TELL HER... TELL HER WE MISS HER. YEAH, OKAY. BYE. [BABY'S CRIES COME OVER MONITOR] [♪♪] ALL RIGHT. YEAH. HI. YEAH, I'D LIKE TO SEE THE APARTMENT, PLEASE? IT WAS RENTED YESTERDAY. [BABY FUSSING AND CRYING] I KNOW, BUD. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE WE ARE, AS LONG AS WE'RE TOGETHER. JUST REMEMBER, CHANGE IS GOOD. YOU KNOW, IT BUILDS CHARACTER. IT MAKES MEN. [GROANS] [SIGHS HEAVILY] BOISE OR BOSTON, WE'RE A TEAM. THAT'S ONE THING THAT'S NEVER GOING TO CHANGE. NEED A LITTLE HELP HERE, BUDDY. DADDY'S STARTING TO GET WORRIED. [RINGS DOORBELL] [DOG BARKING] [BABY CRIES] IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY, BUD. [DOG BARKING] WELL, IT'S ALWAYS DARKEST BEFORE THE DAWN. [RINGS DOORBELL] HELLO! HI, UH, I SAW YOUR SIGN OUT FRONT.

HELLO, PRECIOUS. OH, YES, THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM FOR TWO. IT'S 340 SQUARE FEET. IT'S VERY BRIGHT, AND COZY, TOO. WHAT DO YOU THINK? UH, IT'S... IT'S AMAZING. YOU HAVE YOUR OWN BATHROOM THERE, AND KITCHEN PRIVILEGES AND A WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL BACKYARD. YES... I'M AFRAID TO ASK. HOW MUCH? FIRST, LAST, AND SECURITY, $2000. TOO MUCH? UNFORTUNATELY, YEAH. OH, MY GOODNESS. YOUR AURA JUST WENT FROM BLUE TO RED, AND IT'S THROBBING LIKE A TOOTHACHE. [GASPING IN HORROR] IT'S GOING TO GO BACK TO PURPLE IN A SECOND. YEAH, THERE IT IS. [EXHALING IN RELIEF] WHAT DO YOU SAY I KNOCK IT DOWN TO $1,000? I CAN'T HAVE THAT RED AURA ON MY CONSCIENCE. THAT KARMA WOULD SUCK. SERIOUSLY? YEAH. [♪♪] I DON'T GET IT. HOW COME YOUR MOM CAN'T COME OUT AND TAKE CARE OF ADAM? SHE'S GOT A FULL-TIME JOB, PLUS I WOULD NEVER ASK HER. I'VE BEEN HERE 30 YEARS, I DON'T HAVE THIS MUCH STUFF. TELL ME ABOUT IT. LET'S GO SEE WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO PUT ALL THIS STUFF, BUDDY. LET'S GO. I GOT TO TELL YOU, I DON'T REALLY BUY INTO THIS STUFF. WELL, "THIS STUFF" BOUGHT THE VERY HOUSE THAT YOU'RE LIVING IN. [SHUFFLING CARDS] OKAY, NOW... FORTITUDE. HMM... IS THAT GOOD? ONE OF THE BEST. IT MEANS YOU HAVE RESILIENCE. YOU'RE STRONG. YOU ARE DETERMINED. IF THAT'S A CALC. BOOK HE'S CARRYING, YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF A CONVERT. SHH, SHH, SHH. THE STAR. SHE WHO GUIDES YOU. MY MOTHER. HARVARD WAS HER DREAM. SHE BELIEVED IN ME WHEN I DIDN'T. THAT'S A MOTHER'S JOB. UGH. I HAVE BEEN MEANING TO JUST THROW THIS ONE OUT. EH, YOU KNOW... FORTUNES, THEY RISE, THEY FALL. NEXT... [WHISPERS DRAMATICALLY]: DESIRE. THIS IS A VERY POWERFUL CARD. IN FOURTH POSITION, IT GRANTS A WISH. SO THINK VERY CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU DECIDE. IT MUST BE SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT VERY MUCH. TO BE A GOOD FATHER. [LAUGHS] YOU POOR MISGUIDED SOUL, DO YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU'VE DONE? YOU'VE BLOWN A GUARANTEED PASS IN CALCULUS. YOU'VE WISHED FOR SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY COME TRUE. WE HAVE A FRIDGE FULL OF HOMEMADE SOUP AND A FREE BABYSITTER RIGHT DOWNSTAIRS. [BABY COOS AND GURGLES] HEY, YOU WANT TO SAY HI TO ADAM? SAY HI TO GRANDMA, BUD.

I AM. THESE FLASHY NEW DUDS ARE FROM YOUR GRANDMOTHER WHO LOVES YOU VERY MUCH AND CAN HARDLY WAIT TO SEE YOU, JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE IN BOISE. [TELEPHONE RINGS] YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE IT THERE, ADAM. THE SKIES ARE BLUE AND BOLD, AND THE MOUNTAINS GO ON FOREVER. IT'S A WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL PLACE. JOHN! JOHN, DO YOU HEAR THAT? I BELIEVE THAT'S DEAN FROST CALLING AGAIN.

TOMORROW MORNING, FIRST STAGECOACH OUT. STAGECOACH? IT'S THE ONLY WAY INTO BOISE, MA'AM. THEM FANCY PLANES, THEY DON'T BOTHER MUCH WITH OUR LITTLE COW TOWN. YOU THINK I'M A SNOB, JOHN? NO, MA'AM, A COWARD. YOUR IVORY TOWER HAS NO WINDOWS IN IT. YOU JUDGE WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO AFRAID TO LOOK, AND YOU THINK LIFE CAN BE LIVED BY A TEXTBOOK, BUT IT CAN'T. WE'RE JUST ALONG FOR THE RIDE. A BUMPY ONE. ABSOLUTELY, BUT A ROCKY ROAD CAN LEAD TO A SPECTACULAR BEACH. OR A DRUGSTORE. PLEASE. OH, COME ON, JOHN, PLEASE. LAST WEEK I SAW YOU IN THE DRUGSTORE WITH YOUR LITTLE BOY WHEN YOU WERE BUYING MEDICINE, AND IT CHANGED EVERYTHING I FELT ABOUT YOU. WATCHING THE WAY YOU SHIELDED HIM FROM THE LIGHTS, SEEING THE WAY YOU CRADLED HIM... I REALIZED THAT I WAS WRONG TO JUDGE YOU. YOU'RE A GOOD FATHER, JOHN. I SAW IT A HUNDRED DIFFERENT WAYS THAT NIGHT. I SAW HOW DEEPLY YOU LOVE YOUR SON. SO WHEN WORD CAME THAT YOU'D FAILED YOUR CALCULUS FINAL, I WASN'T SURPRISED. I KNEW IMMEDIATELY WHAT HAD HAPPENED. YOU CHOSE TAKING CARE OF YOUR SON OVER STUDYING FOR YOUR EXAM. THERE'S A CERTAIN HONOR IN THAT F, BECAUSE IT MEANT THAT YOU'D DONE THE RIGHT THING. YOU PUT YOUR CHILD FIRST. I'VE ADDED A STIPEND FOR CHILDCARE, AND A GUARANTEE OF CAMPUS HOUSING. THE REST OF THE SCHOLARSHIP WILL REMAIN THE SAME WITH A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBILITY IN GRADE EXPECTATION. AN HONORABLE MAN DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE, JOHN, AND HARVARD'S GIVING YOU ONE. WE DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO HANG ONTO THE GOOD GUYS. WELCOME BACK, JOHN PATTON. ALICE FOREMAN BADAL.

[APPLAUSE] [THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE] [♪♪] [JOHN]: DEAN FROST KEPT HER WORD, AND I KEPT MINE. HARVARD TOOK CARE OF ME THE NEXT YEAR, AND THE YEARS AFTER THAT, TILL I GRADUATED WITH HONORS AND EARNED A SCHOLARSHIP TO HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL, AND ADAM HAS BEEN WITH ME THE WHOLE WAY. [APPLAUSE] [♪♪]
