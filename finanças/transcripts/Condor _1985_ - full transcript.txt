I work for an international peacekeeping force named Condor. I just finished a rough assignment where I lost a good friend and partner. Condor assigned me a new one-- Lisa Hampton.

Can I interest you in anything else, Mr. Proctor? No thanks, sweetheart, you're not my type. Have a nice day! [air hissing] Proctor!Hey, Sumi! Great to see you. When'd ya get in? Oh, 'bout an hour ago. How you doin'?Oh, no complaints, except for my love life. [chuckling] Join the club. [laughing] How are you doing? Ah, pretty good, considering. Oh, I just heard this morning about the trouble in Singapore. [button rings] Sounds like Brazil all over again. Ah, worse, Sumi. we all came back from that one. [Sumi] I'm really sorry about Cole. He was such a good man. Yeah, he was the best. Oh, look, Proctor, if you want to talk about anything, you know I'm here. Anytime. Yeah, thank you, I appreciate that, Sumi. Maybe later, okay? Yeah. Deal. Deal. Hey, Chris! Hey! I heard you were back, big guy! Yes![laughing] Hey, how's it goin'? Ah, it's goin', but not fast enough. Hey, uh, I'm sorry about what happened over there with Cole. Yeah, we sure coulda used you there, man. Yeah, hey why don't we have dinner tonight? you're gonna have to dredge up some of that stuff you're keepin' buried. It's gonna eat a hole in your stomach the size of the Rose Bowl. [man calling] Chris! Ah, we'll see. Take it easy, Chris. Welcome home. Cyrus. Congratulations on a successful mission. Well, that depends on your definition of success. Well, I know how you must feel right now. It's tough losing a partner. Cole was more than a partner, Cyrus. A whole lot more. Here's my report. Christopher, I wish you'd reconsider about jumping into it so soon. You look like you could use a rest. No, no, no, no way, I haven't been sleeping too much anyway. I could put that in the form of an order you know? Cyrus, I want to work! Very well, come on. [Cyrus] There's someone I want you to meet. [automated voice speaking] Names, please. Christopher Proctor.Cyrus Hampton. Come in, gentlemen. [door buzzing] [door shuts] Lisa? This is Lisa Hampton, Condor's newest member. Lisa, Christopher Proctor. A pleasure, Mr. Proctor. It's not every day one gets to meet a living legend. [chuckles] Well, you can call me Chris. And the pleasure is all mine. Hampton, huh? Any relation here? [Lisa] In a manner of speaking. Well, I really have to compliment you, Cyrus. You always did know how to hire terrific-looking assistants. [Cyrus] Oh, uh, Lisa isn't my assistant. I'm your new partner. My new partner? Now, hold it, Cyrus! I just lost the best partner I ever had! I don't need another! Especially not a-- From now on, I work alone! You know a Condor operative doesn't work alone. Well, then, I don't work. Christopher, Rachel Hawkins is out. She escaped early this morning. I don't know what she's up to yet, but I don't have to remind you now dangerous she is. Not only to society, but especially to you. That's why I want you and Lisa to handle this assignment. How can she help me? What does she know about Hawkins? Rachel Hawkins was a government agent from the year 1992 to 1996. Numerous commendations, rapid promotions. Then she became greedy, began playing both sides of the fence. That's how she earned her code name, Black Widow. [Lisa] Her escape last night not only illustrates her brilliance, it also proves she still has a tight-knit organization on the outside. Three years ago, Miss Hawkins stole the U.S. government's top secret Vanguard Code. That code was the key to the Pentagon's master computer system, and to our national security. Fortunately, she was arrested by Condor operative Christopher M. Proctor before she could utilize the code. Our information indicates her younger sister, Monique, held the organization together during Miss Hawkins' imprisonment. It was believed Miss Hawkins intended to use the Vanguard Code to somehow create an international incident. Thus, in prison, she underwent the prescribed memory erasure that all spies were subject to before it was declared unconstitutional. However, selective memory erasure was, at best, an imperfect technique. So a partial or even total retention of the Vanguard code by Miss Hawkins remains a distinct possibility. Possibility? You can count on it. The Widow's got that code, and she'll find some way to use it. I want the assignment, Cyrus. Solo! Christopher, I did not make this decision lightly. Lisa is an outstanding operative! Okay, okay, she did her homework, I'll give her that. But out there on the streets, I need a whole lot more than a bunch of facts backing me up! You mean all you see me for is my mind? Yeah, you got that right. Very well, then, we'll settle this your way. You win and I'm out. I win and I'm your new partner. Aw, come on, lady! I'm in no mood for jokes. No joke. And the name is Lisa. Cyrus... What have you got to lose? Humor her. This is ridiculous. [exhaling] Whenever. Now. [straining] Damn! You're not human. Cyrus, you old-- She isn't human, is she? Oh, in many ways she is. Uh, but to give you a technically accurate answer... ... no. Lisa's an android, and I'm extremely proud of her. I don't believe this! You were gonna try to set me up with a-- a robot? Lisa far surpasses anything in robotics, Christopher. She represents the world's first molecular computer. And no one outside of this room knows that she exists. Molecular computer. Her thought processes are based on molecular reactions, instead of silicone. That frees Lisa from the rigid binary logic of the conventional computer. You see, her brain consists of tiny bio chips of genetically engineered bacteria. Bacteria which produces enzymes, which are necessary for the transference of thought impulses. Very similar to the enzymes in the human brain. So similar, in fact, that Lisa possesses emotions and feelings-- a whole range of human values. And we did make a deal, Chris. Like it or not. You know what? I don't like it! And the name's Proctor! And you gave your word. [exhaling] Okay, Cyrus! What's the bottom line? Christopher, you are our best operative, but you are not going after Rachel Hawkins without Lisa as your partner. Is that clear? Okay. But you've got 24 hours! 24 hours? You never mentioned that. You never mentioned you were a computer in drag either. Proctor...All right, sorry. If there's nothing else, Cyrus, I wanna go home and try to get some sleep. We start in the morning. Early! Well, Lisa, do you think you can handle our Mr. Proctor? It does pose an interesting challenge, sir. Well, the past week has left him a little ragged around the edges, but I'm sure a little sleep will improve his disposition. If sleep was his intention. Pardon? His voice patterns indicated that he is definitely not going home. [rock music] ♪♪ [indistinct chatter] Ya need somethin'? Yeah. Guy name Manny come in here? I don't know.

Especially when they see how chummy we are. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Okay, look, maybe I did hear some rumblings about a prison break. Some broad called Rachel Hawkins. Supposed to be hiding out here in L.A. someplace. Yeah, where'd ya hear that? A wino, uh... what's his name? You know him. The dwarf! Quaid? [coughing] Manny, get somethin' for your cough, okay?

Everything's been online since Tuesday, but this one unit went down about four hours ago and-- Four hours? Then they're incompetent! We've got a handle on it now. It'll be another 30 minutes. I don't have 30 minutes! And until this equipment is operational, I have nothing! Now, get out! Out! And you! Out! Yes, well, all right, little sister, we've got a lot of work to do. Here you are. Now remember, this is for Seth. Proctor! What the hell are you doin' here! I'm looking for you. We're partners, remember? I keep tryin' to forget! I'm sorry, I didn't know it was you. I didn't mean to rough you up. Oh, youroughed meup! You're lucky you're still breathin'! Or whatever it is you do. 'Cause you don't know zip about the streets! Well, I'm a fast learner.Terrific. You find yourself another teacher. Are you hurt?No, I'm not hurt! Just an old war wound. Look, Proctor, you gave me 24 hours, and I know you don't go back on your word. As you said, I do my homework. All right, Hampton. But you screw up once, just once, and you're history, you understand me? This is my gig, and I don't want any rookie mistakes. So you look at yourself as an observer. You take notes, ask dumb questions, do whatever you wanna do, but stay out of my way! You got that?! As concepts go, that's not too difficult to grasp. So, you want to tell me where we're going... ... partner. To a little out of the way place I know. Well, it's everything you said it was, and less. You stay here. But you might need--Stay here! Proctor! Hampton, will you do me a favor? When I tell you to stay put, stay put! That guy almost turned you into scrap metal! It's Quaid! He's still alive! Call for backup. [beeping] Requesting police and ambulance assistance. 2496 Grand Street. There's been a double shooting. Quaid? It's Proctor. Now just take it easy, buddy. Help's on the way. Quaid, you gotta tell me about the Widow. Where is she? U-- u-- u-- unde-- under... Under. Under what? Was he a close friend? Eh, we helped each other out every now and then. Poor guy. He never hurt a soul. Except maybe himself. Do you have any idea what he meant by the word "under"? No, but whatever it was, it was enough for the Widow to shut him up. There are 148 words that utilize the prefix, "under". But without further input, I can't reduce the list about more than half. I guess that's not much help at this point. Not much. Who was he? Hired meat. You're never gonna trace down the Widow through him. She's too smooth. Proctor, no one is that smooth. Hampton, lesson number one, never underestimate the Widow. Right. By the way, the way you pulled that guy's aim off me really showed guts. Of course, it's no big deal, you risking your neck. You can always order another one, right? Proctor, we have to talk. Yeah? About what? About the fact that we're gonna be partners for the next 24 hours, so you might as well get used to it. Wrong, Hampton, it is now 3:00 a.m., and you're already down to 19 hours. Besides which, I can tell you, this whole thing isn't gonna work. You know, it might if you'd give it half a chance. It's your stubborn resistance to technology. Hey, I got nothin' against technology, in its place! Oh, and I bet some of your best friends are robots, right? Look! This whole thing is wrong! You, Cyrus, all of it! What do you know about Cyrus Hampton anyway? I know that he founded Condor as an international peace-keeping force specializing in anti-terrorist activities. Yeah, that's the official version. Now I'm gonna tell you about Cyrus Hampton. You see, when Cyrus was a young man, he discovered a principle of physics called The Hampton Hypothesis. Yeah, I know that, Proctor. Will you let me finish, please! Now, it was supposed to be the key to peace and prosperity for all of mankind. And then, the military got ahold of it. And the result was the South American War. Well, that nearly broke Hampton's heart. And ever since then, he's been trying to make it up to the world through Condor. But now I think it's just finally pushed him right over the line. And you're living proof of it. I don't understand. [chuckling] I don't even know why I'm tellin' you all of this. See, I'm worried about Cyrus and about Condor because they mean a lot to me. But they exist in the human world, and there's no way a machine like you is ever gonna replace a human in a job like this. You're wrong, Proctor! I haven't let you down yet. And I won't. [sighs] Are you comin', ma'am? My car is three blocks east of here. Hey, hey, hey, what's the matter with you? What is this? You're hurt! I was... But I've self-repaired. I should've known. A little rest and I'll be fine. No, no, no. You're still in no shape to drive. Come on, you can spend the night at my place. Um, can we stop by my car and pick up a few things? [chuckling] See? You've only been with me a couple of hours, and all ready, you're a royal pain in the rear. That's it, Rachel, we're ready. Three years I have waited and planned for this, little sister. And now I own this city! Only they don't know it yet! [chuckles] I just wish that Seth was here to see it. ♪♪ [cat meowing] Yeah. [laughing] Yeah, Virgil, I know, I know.

I know, Quaid's message has me puzzled too. But I think I can help with the second part. Where's your PC? My "PC"? Personal computer. Oh, that. That's right over there. I don't know what I'd do without it. I see. I'm remote-linking with Condor's master computer. [chuckles] I hope it's not a toll call. Let's see... "Use of the Vanguard code has "been abandoned by the government, "but it still protects some of the larger, "non-military computer systems around the country. Corporations, mainly." No, it's not Widow's style. "The code also remains in place "in some of our major law enforcement bureaus. "Anchorage, Honolulu, Los Angeles." The police master computer! That's it! Possibly, but even if she did access it, what could she gain? It's mainly an information storage. You tell me. You're the brains of the outfit. You'd better make it fast, 'cause this partnership is gettin' short. Look, Proctor, I intend to see this thing through to the end, you know... Wait a second. You're here because I got suckered, okay? I want a rematch. Right now! Same stakes, but this time, lady, I am ready. You're not serious? Oh, come on, Hampton, humor me. Okay. You ready? Unh! [sighs] Ugh!

Time is short, Commissioner. That it is, Mr. Proctor, that it is. The day is nearly gone, and I'm two hours behind schedule. Let's talk on the way to the heliport. Now, how can I help you with this Rachel Hawkins business? Sounds more like something for the federal boys to me. Convicted felon, escaped spy, all that. We have reason to believe that Rachel Hawkins possesses the Vanguard access code, which protects your master computer. Which means your entire computer system is vulnerable to her. That's impossible. What good would a police computer do her anyway? Well, we don't know that yet. Well, I wouldn't lose any sleep over it. Our computer is basically an internalized system, so there's no way someone on the outside can tap into it, code or no code. You're forgetting one very important thing, Commissioner. Rachel Hawkins is no outsider. Don't ever underestimate her. On the contrary, Mr. Proctor, don't you underestimate our computer. [control tower announcer] Heliport control reports all systems normal. Heliport control, unit three, cleared for liftoff. This, Mr. Proctor and Miss Hampton, is the newest and finest police heliport anywhere in the country. Yeah, well that's all very nice, Commissioner-- See those mini drones over there? Amazing machines-- fully automated, pilotless, our eye in the sky. With air mobility and firepower-- You haven't been listening to a damned word I've been sayin', have you? Look, Proctor, I've always cooperated with the Condor organization, but you're way off base on this. No one accesses our computer without clearance. now if you don't mind, I'm... Two hours behind schedule. Yes, I know. Look, Mr. Ward, what Pro--Skip it, Hampton. The man ain't buyin'.[phone ringing] Excuse me, sir, urgent call on your private line. Miss Rachel Hawkins. I'll take it here. Put a trace on 'em. Yes, sir. You know who I am, Mr.Ward, so I shall come straight to the point. You have 12 hours to meet the following demands. First I want $25 million deposited in a Swiss bank account that I shall specify. Second, a guaranteed safe passage out of The United States to a country of my choosing. And finally, deliver Condor agent, Chris Proctor to me, alive. Miss Hawkins, you're not only making a fool of yourself, you're wasting my time. Within the hour I shall demonstrate that you have no choice. And then we shall see who the fool is. What's the make on that call? Traced to a pay phone, sir. We have a unit on the scene now. They found a micro-relay patched into the lines, but the origin of the call is unknown. Like I said, Commissioner, protect that computer! Trust me, Proctor, we already have it covered.

You're making impossible demands, I need more time. I gave you 12 hours. Even your sluggish bureaucracy should be able to handle that. Lady, what you're asking for would take days, not hours.

Meanwhile, investigations continue into the cause of the mysterious blast which-- [radio off] Under! Under! Under what?! You know, Proctor, I've noticed several microwave dishes on the police building. Yeah, so, what about it?! Well, a possibility occurs. It's never been done before, but if Miss Hawkins used the Vanguard code to beam microbursts of information onto those dishes, then she could reprogram the computer and not even be detected. Oh, yeah, sure, I can buy that... I guess. We still don't know where in the hell she is! Well, I'm working on that! What do you want, a miracle! Yeah, you got one?! Oh, I forgot, you areone!

There must be a connection there somewhere. we just have to dig it out. Yeah, and all we need is time. So far, the only thing we have to go on is the word "under". Which isn't a whole lot at this point. Utility trucks. Utility trucks. Utilities. Utilities. Wait a minute, utilities-- telephone cables, gas lines, sewer lines. [snapping fingers] That's it! Sewers! That's what Quaid meant. The Widow is underground! Of course, the storm drains. Well, it's a strong possibility, Christopher, but there are hundreds of miles of storm drains under this city. It would take days to locate her. Yeah, well, it's better than nothin'. We'll keep in touch, Cyrus. Operations, please. According to the dispatcher at the department of power, the first work stop for one of the missing utility trucks was on Norton Avenue, between 5th and 6th Street. Yeah?

We only have 16 minutes to go. Drone target list coming up now. First three strikes are on a time sequence. But Proctor's drone is on a direct-kill order! [Hampton] He doesn't have a chance. [Cas] Yes, he does. I'm pullin' the plug.It won't work, Cas. Why not? Hawkins has remote-programmed her entire plan into the police master computer. All orders to the mini drones are originating there, not here. Well, can't the police shut it down? Impractical. A computer that size would have its own internal power supply. And by the time we broke through all the memory safeguards, half of L.A. would be history. Then what are our options?Only one. We have to de-program the police computer from here by remote control, Undoing everything Hawkins fed into it step by step In ten minutes? Right. I'm gonna need your help, Cas. You got it. What's first? Determine her program structure, and then call all entry points. But, Lisa, that'll take time. Hopefully not more than ten minutes. Yeah, right. There's no way, Lisa. With the time we have left, it's not humanly possible. [beeping] Where'd you learn how to do that? It comes naturally. Nothing natural about that. [Cas] It's working, keep it up. There, we've broken through the initial sub routine. Now to search the logistical modules. Good, that gives me a major entry point. Four minutes and 30 seconds. How much time, Sumiko? [Sumiko] Three minutes, 40 seconds. You're not reading that? Yes, I am.What are you, part computer? That's classified. [nervous laughter] The closer we get to the heart of the program, the more safeguards Hawkins has built in. Stand by, Cas. [Sumiko] 35 seconds, Lis. Hawkins designed this program to be unbreakable. It looks like she's gonna succeed. [Cas] Come on! Come on! Hampton? [laughter] Hampton? Yes, Proctor? Your timing, is improving. [laughter] [Cyrus] Well, I believe that congratulations are in order for a job well done. [Proctor] Well, thank you, Cyrus. I had a lot of help from Cas and Sumiko. [Cyrus] Aren't you forgetting Lisa? No, she was all right, for a robot. Now, wait a minute, Christopher, I read the reports, She came through with flying colors. Oh, she flies too, huh? It figures. Oh, come on, Proctor, admit it. We make a good team. Made, Hampton. Made. [Cyrus] Now wait a minute, Christopher. [beeping] Oh, I've got a meeting. You'll have to excuse me. But we'll discuss this later, after you've had some rest. I've got a feeling it's gonna be a short rest. Proctor, you can slow down a little you know. You've been through a lot. Aw, no problem, Hampton. Doc gave me straight "A"s. Oh, cracked ribs don't count? Is there anything you don't know about me? Of course. Like what? Personal details. For example, I have no information on how you might hold a woman. A woman you really cared about. Or how you might kiss her. And how she would respond. Oh man, I'm really losin' it. I really am! Later, Hampton! Proctor, may I have a ride to my car? Get in! It's in the other direction. It's in the other direction! You're a pain, Hampton. A royal pain! [siren wailing] [Hampton] I guess you are losing it, partner. ♪♪
