- I can still remember the smell of my dad's Triumph when he would shut her off. It had a weird smell, it was hot, you could smell it. Every once in a while a bike will come into the shop and I'll smell that smell again. It's a weird smell. ("The Quay" by The American Wake) (engine roaring) ("Ballydesmond" by The American Wake) (engines buzz) - My friends call me Meatball. I started off having a motorcycle shop in Huntington Beach, maybe 15 years ago. It started off as just being a place to goof around and store my bikes and maybe get a few of the guys' bikes running and get some cheap parts and stuff. I got serious for a moment and bought a vintage home in Anaheim and started working out of the back of that instead of renting shops all the time. I figured I'd buy a house that had a place where I could store my stuff and get some work done. That's Gus and Lucky, the No Gooders. The world's largest motorcycle gang. It's always good having the No Gooders out here to drink beers with but also to get some work done. The last couple months we've been building this '71 Triumph motor. A lot of guys put a big board kit, pump it up with horsepower and stuff like that. We decided to go a little different route. It's been a long couple of months. In the morning we're gonna find a couple of deserted roads and race around on it, see what she can do. ("So Long" by Smiling Face Down) (engine revving) We're working on a 1971 Bonneville. World's fastest motorcycle. - [Lucky] Were they the fastest in 71, I don't know. - They got the position at Daytona in '71. With our friend Gene Romero. 157 miles an hour. - [Lucky] That's a good thing. I'm out of terrible beers. Who wants another one? - I do. First thing you wanna do is get everything good and clean so you can really get a good look at what's going on, what's worn out and what's not. What we'll do is tear this bad boy down and we're gonna get it all bathed. Tank it all, hot, soapy water, get it all tanked. Get all the oil out of these pores so it looks real nice and get all the parts cleaned up. So we know what's broken and what's not. Triumph Motorcycle is the best British motorcycle ever made. The 650 motor went through the least amount of changes through the years, but it's the best motor. It's lightweight and a good horsepower make and motor that rotates the right way so it handles well. Triumph motorcycle was what everyone wanted to have to go racing with or go to the bar with. It was a great motorcycle. ("So Long" by Smiling Face Down) All the heat and straight chopsticks in the world can't get that gear off. I gotta go get some new chopsticks. Then we'll do it again. We're gonna get it off, we're gonna call it a night. I think I got my first motorcycle probably it was 1969 or 1970. I had a Yamaha Mini Enduro, the little white and red one that's on the opening film of On Any Sunday, with the big feller on it. My dad used to have Triumphs, used to do a little bit of racing and stuff. Finally, I found my first Triumph, I still own it and I got 200 thousand miles on that thing and I've never rebuilt the bottom end. It's just a great motorcycle. It's actually the same year as the one that I'm building right now. It kinda came full circle again. It's a good motorcycle, '71 Triumph's a good motorcycle. It's a fun project. My buddy who had a Harley, he was always waiting on me, you know. "Where's that freaking Meatball at?" I'd be down the freeway still coming. That's when I first started thinking, I've gotta make this thing go faster. Because 650 Triumph can only go so fast compared to a 1200 CC Harley Davidson. They went down the freeway a little better than I did. Of course I didn't know how to time my bike right. I had one cylinder running 30 degrees advanced and one running 40 degrees retarded. Just winging it, smoke billowing out, goofing around. Probably embarrassing at some point. That's probably why they called me Meatball. But then I slowly learned how to make the bikes go a little better, and tune em right. Then I started going to the racetrack and seeing what those guys were doing and making em lighter, pulling stuff off and cutting stuff off the frame. Making the exhaust free flowing. Before I knew it, I could make a Triumph go pretty fast. Pretty cool. - I met Meatball at the neighborhood bar. Just got married in September, and we've been together for almost four years this August. Everything about him is unique I think. There's nothing about him that's like anyone else. It was probably on our second date, and he took me out to the parking lot and he said, "Guess which one of these cars is mine." I was looking around, and I knew it wouldn't be an SUV or a Honda or something. There was this little dirty convertible, green car is his Triumph car, it's all beat up and dinged up, and I said, "It's that one." He's what he is up front. There's no denying what he likes or what he's into. Probably from there I asked him what kind of car that was, he went into the whole Triumph thing, how he has 50 motorcycles or whatever. I had never heard of Triumph before, so for a while I didn't quite understand what he did. Like, did he sell Triumphs, was he a dealership? I had no clue until I actually went to the shop. Once I walked in, I knew what it was all about. There's a lot of racket, a lot of guys hanging out. I like to watch. (engine rumbling) (talking over each other) - This is a big deal. (speaker drowned out by metal clanging) I remember when I bought that 1970 Husky 400 and I took it to George Updike, and I was all, "Hey, can you help me out with this thing?" He's all like, "What the fuck you doing kid? "They sell brand new dirt bikes." Oh no, I wanna ride this one. "Go race it in vintage motor cross." He was over it, guy was just like, "Beat it." - Watch your head. - He's got a helmet on, don't worry. - Do they make these in the hard hat version? We're a hat club now. I thought after all the stupid stories we've told, this fucking thing. - I tell ya. - [Lucky] A cracked egg. Look at that. Damn Meatball, you waited too long, that yolk's hard. - [Meatball] Come on, give me a break. - The bearings popped right out. - [Gus] That's that two piece bearing. Wow, that's some cute oil you got going on with that. - You can make it sit right there. I'm going out to the Elsinore Motor Cross Track and we're gonna mosey around a little bit and get stared at by a much of modern bike motorcycle guys. I'm bringing the '68 BSA Single and a '71 BSA Single. I was gonna see which one of these bikes might work the best for the Elsinore Grand Prix that's coming up. That's this weekend. I like the vintage bikes seeing how's I'm getting older. It fits my lifestyle a lot better. I figure the coolest thing to do is just get some old Triumph or BSA that makes a bunch of racket. Heck, I'm used to riding those older style bikes anyways. I think I ride just as good on an old BSA or Triumph as I would on a modern bike. Just doing a burn out and a wheelie and jumping it, doing silly stuff like that. People think, "Wow, that's pretty cool." It took a long time for Triumph and BSA to make a real motor cross bike. They had a couple of factory racers and stuff but if the average California guy wanted to race a BSA at the races in the '60s and '70s, he just took his street bike, took the lights off it, and put a couple lighter things on it. Took his badges off and just went and raced it. Regular street bike, you know. So the bikes that I race, they're just street bikes. I take everything off em that's heavy. Maybe rework the head a little bit, the carburetor, run a little sprockets, I eliminate chain weight and stuff like that. Cam and a little difference so the power comes on at a different RPM, and it works pretty good. Maybe change the front end out so you can get a little lighter front end that takes the bumps a little better. British bikes make good dirt bikes. Right off the bat, you just take a few things off and they work pretty good. And they're cool, girls like em. (engine rumbling) My arms hurt, I'm a little tired. I don't get to do it very often, and when your arms get tired you make mistakes. So I just figured, I'll take it easy and save my mistakes for Saturday at the races. No sense getting hurt here. If you're gonna get hurt, you wanna do it at the racetrack. I'll just take it easy and then Saturday morning we'll see what kind of mind set I have. (engine revving) (people talking) Today's Elsinore Grand Prix and we're out here at Lake Elsinore. Me and a few of my buddies are gonna all go out there and kick some dirt around, throw some rocks at some guys. - Too old for this. No just kidding, old's what you become when you don't do this. I just gotta survive for whatever time it is. That's all it is. And hopefully kick a few asses on the way. - This is the necklace Juliette made me for good luck. Me and Rose and her got one on. We'll see how it works. I'm gonna put on a little bit of plastic in case I roll around on that pavement. - [Juliette] You look cool Dad. - I think the best part is just being a little bit nervous and then when the flag goes down, you forget about being nervous and it's all concentration. So it's that quick change from being edgy and then bam, the concentration. It's pretty fun to go fast. It's like breaking the law, breaking the rules. (engine revving) I think it was Adelanto Grand Prix was the first time I ever raced, and I caught the banners in my wheels. I wrecked about five times, they were trying to drag me off the track. One time I went off a jump and landed right in the face of the next jump and I drove the handlebars into my chest, right into my gas tank. I didn't even have a chest protector on, no pad across it, my chest hurt for a month. I think I bruised my heart, but I went crazy. I got on that thing, they waived the flag, and I just went ape, went crazy. Falling down, just trying to keep up a good pace. I don't even know what place I got, who knows? I was trying though. ("Ambition" by Fortune's Flesh) No brakes. (people talking) - I felt pretty good until I hit the ground. The ground's very hard. I hit my elbow, my face. Should wear a full face helmet. This vintage stuff is really, fuck. Meatball, this tank got destroyed. I came around a turn and I was going to cross the path because I knew there were some potholes coming up, and I misjudged it and I hit the potholes. Like Meatball said. The thing started swamping on me, and down you go. I felt like I wasn't gonna get back on it, but I did. - Here you go. - Thank you. - [Rose] I'm sorry you didn't finish. - A lap later, I started going again, but it's way too late. Can't crash, you've gotta stay on. - This is my vintage motor cross shirt. That's Lucky right there. - [Gus] That's Lucky right there. - [Meatball] That's Brook's number, but Lucky was riding the bike. That's a flying lip stand right there. - [Rose] That's the split, and he's about to scratch up his face. - [Lucky] It wasn't too fun. It all happens pretty quick. - I'd rather have the t-shirt than experience it firsthand. How did the high performance BSA handle that hill? - It handled it good, but no brakes I tell ya. - [Rose] I think it was loud though. - It was good. - You could hear him coming. You could hear him going. - It was plopping. It was shooting flames out the back. And the people at the top of the hill going, "Come on, come on," so I go by every time, "No brakes," down the hill. They're all like, "Yeah, no brakes." - [Lucky] All the way to the bottom, I thought oh I'm gonna die this time. - There's a big hole dug out at the bottom too. I tried to miss that thing, but when you're sliding down, the rocks are tumbling down behind you, everything's trying to push you into that hole. No, not getting buried alive yet. - I got something for Meatball and I to share. It says to Lucky, from Meatball. I'm gonna put this thing to use. - Look at my seat, you know it's not gonna be the best when a guy has a seat like that on his motorcycle. I ain't gonna drink out of that thing. Is it really tequila in here? - Hell fucking yes. - [Lucky] Sorry about that mom. - Cheers, the hole never heals. - [Lucky] Swimmers, bowling, and women. - Lovely. I gotta go work right now. I gotta go put a couple motorcycles together. What we've done is we've torn the motor completely apart and we've separated it into categories, things that need to get bathed for inspection and things that are okay the way they are. In order to check bearings and clearances and find out what parts are still good and what ones aren't, we need to go have them bathed. What we do is we put them in a tank with extremely hot, soapy water, and it gets all the dirt out of the pores and out of the little crevices and stuff so that we can check things thoroughly. We're on our way to the bather, we're gonna go take a bath. - Just like your momma's dishwasher. - This is my buddy John Edwards. This is R & D Machine Shop, Costa Mesa, California. - What we're gonna be doing on this silver head to increase the performance is to change the valves. We're gonna put a little bit bigger valve head in the engine, and we're also gonna put a smaller stem in the engine as well. The big difference between these is you can kinda see, this is the stock, standard valve. This is a brand new valve. You can see that the stem is fairly large compared to what we've got here. This is approximately eight millimeters on the old stem, the new one is gonna be six millimeters. So that's a significant amount of reduction in stem diameter. The fact too that the valve is gonna be a little bit lighter than what this one's gonna be. Valve guides have not been produced for this style of installation. This is something that we're doing as a development project. So I'm taking a stock valve and I have a blank I'm going to machine down the exterior dimensions, but you can see it's gonna have a much smaller inside diameter for the new valves we're gonna be putting in. This is the same head as what we're gonna be doing this to. We will be opening up this area a little bit. We'll also enlarge the port area to allow for a little more air fuel mixture to enter in to the cylinder. Then we'll go inside, get rid of all the rough spots that might be inside there. We wanna try and make the flow going through the ports as efficient as we can. We have to look at boundary layers, we look at laminar air flows and we wanna make sure those are within parameters that are gonna give us the best amount of horsepower for the size engine that we're dealing with. Another thing to about going to a smaller stem valve and going to a lighter valve is that the acceleration for the engine is gonna be much quicker, and that's an important feature when you're doing a racing engine, 'cause you wanna be able to get your RMPs as quick as possible. Make sure you get that power to the ground of course. By doing that, you generally win races. - The idea for Smiling Face Down came after I'd been in a couple of punk bands and I thought it'd be fun to do a little something not so heavy and maybe a little lighthearted. Once I hooked up with Paul, my guitar player, from there it was all fun and games. It was just a good time to get together with the fellers and of course have a cold beer. What makes tonight special is all my buddies from Santa Barbara are coming down. We're gonna head south to Doheny Beach to play at Coconuts, should be a really fun night. (engine revving) ("Miss Birmingham Small Arms" by Smiling Face Down) We're back here at R & D Machine Shop and we're gonna check out the cleaning job that was done and we're gonna clean the sludge trap and the Triumph crank and then we're gonna do some balancing tricks to the crank assembly, then we're gonna go out and look for someone to kick the shit out of. See these spots here, near the cylinder bore. That is probably from where the rings were sitting and rusted, and so we have small indentions. So when the rings come by the cylinder here, they'll wipe it clean but it'll miss these indentions here and oil will sit in the barrel and will cause the bike to smoke and lose a little horsepower too. We're gonna ditch these spots, we're gonna make it all brand new in there. New pistons, new rings, new bore. Alright, this is one of the most important things to rebuild on your motorcycle, is making sure the sludge trap in this crank assembly is clean. The reason why it's so important is first of all, there's a trap in here in order to catch dirt, debris, and stuff, and if we don't clean it out it slowly starts to build up, blocking these passageways. Causing the oil not to flow through the motor properly. When you're out of proper oil flow, things start to stick together, overheat, and then we have a major malfunction. So what we've gotta do is every time we have this motorcycle part, the sludge trap needs to be pulled out. This is most important, very, very important. So now we're gonna reassemble this. One crank assembly, ready to go. Me and GG are going out to Paris Raceway today, do some dirt track. It's a $400 motorcycle, the engine case is in the barrels and stuff and this chassis I don't even know if it's straight or not. I just put some Bultaco front end on it, Bultaco wheels, and plopped it together. It's a 1966 BSA 441, got a 30 year old tire on the back and a $30 tire on the front. This thing is so loud I can't ride it. I went around the block and people were yelling out their windows at me and stuff. It came alive. Some guy was trimming his trees right there by the fence. I'm running, I bump in, he just goes, "Wow." Like this right next to this guy. He's cutting his trees, he jumped out of his skin. Into the freaking atmosphere, he was yelling at me. (engines revving) ("Sailor Jerry Rum" by Faraway Boys) (engines revving) Today is a day we get stuff back from the machine shops and the crank balancing shops. We have a Triumph 650 crank and we've had some weight taken out of it in order to make this thing run smoothly. We're gonna get this thing put together, we're gonna get some rods put on there with new shell bearings and eventually put it in the icebox, get it nice and cold and put it in the other two motorcycle halves and start building a motor. This thing will go fast, scare people. Cams are usually sold in pairs, and to go road racing you're gonna want more of a top end cam and when you go dirt tracking, you want a mid-range top end cam. When you go motor crossing, you want to use a low end cam. Right off idle, where it makes your power where you're on and off the gas a lot. With these cams we split it up, we used two different style cams to get more of a pull off the line and not be real extreme in any way, but really hook up good horsepower and good delivery with the horsepower. This is a good stopping point for today, and what we're gonna do from here is we're gonna plop it in our motor stand and then slowly start putting it together piece by piece, the little finishing touches and gears and stuff, clutches. That's it for today. This is Tom Brokaw, signing off. - Thanks a lot for inviting us to the bike show. We appreciate it. I thought of Benihanas and Kawasakis, fucked up. This is off the number 143 hit in Texas, Japan, and Malaysia. This is called Don't Need No Woman Tonight. ("Don't Need No Woman Tonight" by Thirteen Stars) This is the First Annual Hell on Wheels Beauty Pageant. People should be in here somewhere. This is a great day for a horny, married guy. Which one of these girls am I not going home with tonight? All of em. We have two judges, we have the No Gooders' Gus. (audience applauding) The underappreciated Gus. (audience cheering) The highly underrated Gus. And Lucky, the overrated Lucky. The highly overrated Lucky. (audience cheering) Number one and first up. - Two blonde bombshells. - [Announcer] In the Hell on Wheels Beauty Pageant is Z. (audience cheering) Did you see that kick? Do that kick one more time. Next up we have Abigail. (audience cheering) Look at that outfit, for god's sake, look at that outfit. Why won't my wedding ring come off? ("If I'm So Wonderful" by Smiling Face Down) - [Meatball] Rose, is that you? - Hello. - I need help. - [Rose] Okay, I brought your Coke if you're thirsty. - I need you to pin this motor real quick. - [Rose] What do I do? - Just grab these pins and when I get the holes lined up, you pin her. - [Rose] This is cool, where'd you get it? - I got it from Darren, he made that for me. Are we ready? - Yes. - Okay, make sure I don't pinch my hands on the sink 'cause I'll start crying. - Alright. - Get that top one first. - [Rose] Go up a little bit. Wait wait, it's not all the way through. - It's not? Alright, I'm gonna be out here for a little bit. - Okay. - [Meatball] So, make me some dinner, huh? (laughs) - Got it. - Give me a kiss. I was just joking. - [Rose] Now you have red lipstick on. - Now make me some dinner. (laughs) Freshly polished from GG. Keep mucking with my hands. This bore is gonna be 60 over, 60 over 650. We're all good to go with the 650 bore. I feel pretty confident that we go really fast with a 650. We don't need the extra 100 CC's. And the final chassis on this will be a TT Racer. That's Tavern to Tavern Bar Hopper. We probably won't be taking on the track or anything like that, but we're gonna wanna go fast through town. It's starting to look more like a motorcycle. We're at a good stopping point here, seeing as how we're waiting for a couple of parts to come in, so what we'll do is pin this thing, make sure it's not gonna fall around and then throw a couple rags and a bag on it. Then she'll be ready to go to sleep. It took me a while to get used to road racing. It's fun, when you're going 120 miles an hour you realize that shoot, I probably shouldn't be doing this. It's not too safe, so you get pretty excited when you do it. It's like taboo you know. Gosh I probably shouldn't be doing this, but it's pretty fun, good fun coming in and making a bunch of racket and going really fast. Have bugs splatting on your windscreen and stuff, it's pretty cool. (engine revving) ("The Doryman" by The American Wake) We got our new head back from R & D Engineering in Costa Mesa, we made a couple improvements to make this bike go faster. First thing that we did is cut the valve stems down to six millimeters instead of the big old tree stumps that we used to use. The second thing we've done is we've gone to a lighter single spring conical shape instead of the two big old springs we used to use. The old springs were two springs, they were laid upon inside of each other. This is how they got the tension that they wanted on the valve train, so this'll make the cam work less and the motor work less to do what it needs to do in order to make horsepower. Starting to look like a motor. This is our replacement for the chain. The guy that built this, Bob Oswald, he's back in PA and he's 95 years old and he's still kicking ass. He puts these things together. Still wraps stuff in newspaper like in the old days. Here's our crank seal to keep the oil out. This is the engine gear right here. It runs off the crank, and here's our clutch assembly. Instead of running three clutch springs, you have one single diaphragm. It's all tricked out, makes for a nice even flow when that clutch is grabbing. What I'm doing here is I'm weighing the weight difference between the two assemblies. This is the QPD belt drive, it comes in at about eight pounds. Then we'll stick the stock Triumph one on there and see what that thing comes in at. So it looks like we're gonna save about, eight minus 14, six pounds of rotating mass on this motor. Five and a half, that's pretty damn good. One QPD belt drive. This is a good stopping point for the day. I've had enough motor building, and now I'm gonna meet up with my buddies to go for a good long ride. ("Cowboy Moon" by Faraway Boys) (people talking) - You can make fun of me, but the '60s was a fun time. '60s and '70s I think. I don't know, I think we had our problems back then and we got our problems now, but people were cooler back then for sure. I don't know. Steve McQueen rode Triumphs and Huskies, he was a movie star, had all the money in the world, could do anything he wanted, and that's what he did. Kinda like, I'm living like a movie star. I'm just 40 years out of it. I'm not a movie star by today's standards. But I'm doing what was good enough for a movie star 40 years ago. That's my life. ("Dry" by Smiling Face Down) - I rolled out the '71 and we cleaned it up, touched it up a bit so it'd look halfway decent. Tonight I have the best of all my buddies here. We're anxious to get this motor in the frame and get it buttoned up so we can go test it this weekend. This is Chris Wakula, Wakula Racing. He's a good gear man. He's a good buddy too. - I'm trying to dial these cams in so they open and close at the right time. It's not a standard cam so kinda cajole them into place a bit. - [Meatball] It's kinda odd that the motor I'm building and testing is a '71 because my first Triumph motorcycle that I ever bought was a '71 Triumph. I'm very familiar with this chassis and the bike 'cause I've got 200 thousand miles on this chassis so it's gonna be like my first baseball glove or something, I'm gonna know it so well. It makes me realize how much I really miss this bike. Every one of my buddies is good at a lot of different things but my good friend Mike Englet, he can straighten anything that's metal. He's great at putting on fenders and straightening tanks, takes golf ball dents out of everything. He just looks at a fender and gets it lined up. Everybody thinks putting a fender on is easy. It's not easy, I guarantee you nine out of 10 guys put their fender on crooked. Got GG helping me so that I look pretty good going down the street. I got John Lee, who's a trained mechanic but he can put anything together. He's great with details. - Oh fuck, I never had anything. - [Meatball] Saved six pounds, it's got the trick clutch. - Six pounds? - [Meatball] Saved six pounds of rotating mass and it's got. - Fuck. - Nice clutch. - That's what I've got to do next on mine. - [Meatball] Of course I've got the No Gooders here drinking all my booze. They got a fine eye for knowing what's the coldest beer and what's the best tasting brown water. ("Midnight Rambin' Man" by Thirteen Stars) - I feel privileged, I'm opening up the last ARD Magneto. I didn't even get one. - [Meatball] That's the last one ever made. - [Man] Look at that bush. - Is this what he sent? Holy cow, jackpot. I think he cleaned out his whole Playboy collection for this. It's the last one, I guess the guy's retiring. So that makes it pretty special and he was the kick ass ARD Magneto guy for forever. - Since the early '60s. - Yeah, everybody ran this shit. Meatball's privileged to have the guy made him the last one. Thank you very much, Alan. - [Meatball] The bike looks good, it all came together the way it was supposed to. Tomorrow's the big day, we're gonna sound the trumpet. ("Dry" by Smiling Face Down) - How fast do you think it's gonna go? Come on, Lucky. - It's gotta go 130, right? 140? - What about you? What do you think? - I think we're gonna go 170 on this. - Thinking high. - I'd think 100 miles an hour would be fast enough. - I think at least 150, 150. - [Lucky] And we're gonna take it to Daytona and run it. 150 like Gene Romero. - [Man] Give Gene Romero a run for his money. I bet everyone a dollar it'd start up. - I got a buck on that. - Alright. - First kick or second kick? - I say second kick. - [Lucky] I say fifth kick. Meatball? What kick? - [Meatball] First or second. (engine starting) - [Everyone] Oh! (men cheering) (engine revving) - I can't wait to see it on the road. Today's just the first day, starting. Next is actually getting it on the road. That's where it's really gonna be exciting. It's a throwback to the old ways. The way things used to be done in the old days. When people liked motors that went fast. That's what this is, it's a motor that's gonna go super fast. Good job, well done. Another masterpiece. ("The Quay" by The American Wake) (train rumbling) (engine revving)
