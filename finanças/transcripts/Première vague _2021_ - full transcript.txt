DECEMBER 16th 2019 : FIRST DOCUMENTED PATIENT INFECTED WITH COVID-19 IN A HOSPITAL IN WUHAN, CHINA. FEBRUARY 27th 2020 : FIRST REPORTED CASE OF COVID-19 IN THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC. MARCH 11th 2020 : THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DECLARES... THAT COVID-19 IS NOW A WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC. MARCH 12th 2020 : DAY 1 Try it! Try it! Come on, you’re gonna like it, I promise. Trust me, it’s really good. - So? - Can’t believe I’ve never had this! - It’s so tasty! - It’s good, eh? You didn’t have this in Drummond? My parents were more the type to order roasted chicken or pizza. But this, wow... That’s not rural food like your roasted chicken. Well, welcome to Montreal. A whole new world. Yeah, it’s just been a month, but I feel like I’ve always lived here. - Cheers! - Cheers! We’ve been hanging out for 16 hours straight, and I’m not getting on your nerves yet. It just sucks that you’re leaving already, but whatever. Yeah, I promised the boys that we would get some beers before the show. I dunno, it would be a little awkward to invite you in our gang at this stage of our relationship. At this stage of our relationship? - Yeah, that’s not what I meant. - Guillaume, I’m kidding, for real. Tomorrow, I’m working all day at the hair salon, maybe we can get together in the evening? Yeah, deal, let’s do that. Okay. Bye. No kiss? Well, at this stage of our relationship... Okay, good. Like this. On the left... I know, Dad, I know. Without these, we would never go on your Sunday stroll. Okay, here... Wait, like this. Great. You happy? You’ll be able to predict the future. Tell us if we’re gonna be rich! You understand? Rich! Good. Wait, woah! Wait, Wait! I almost forgot this. Put this on so you don’t get sick. Okay, I’ll put my hat on too. Okay, let’s go. Okay, yeah, yeah! Calm down, calm down! The government has decided to play an important leadership role here... - That means : we’re going to act strong... - Hello! Hello. So, how was your date with Guillaume? It was very nice. We went out to eat phò. Hey, we never had that in Drummond? Of course Drummond has phò. - Laura, I’ve never had that. - Fanny... I ate some 2 years ago with my mom. SHOW CANCELLED You know, sometimes, when you don’t know it’s there, it’s as if it doesn’t exist. You know, sometimes, when you don’t know it’s there, it’s as if it doesn’t exist. - Is this mine? - Yeah, it arrived for you earlier. Ah yes, it’s my reading chair. It looks small. Well… you’ll need to assemble it. Hey, did you see this? As of today, a state of emergency is in effect for all of Quebec. For the moment, the coronavirus pandemic is under control in Quebec... I insist on "for the moment". Today, we have 13 cases, with 2 people in the hospital... No gatherings of more than 250 people... and it's possible that we’ll have to stay confined at home for a week or two. A week or two? That’s so long. Well, I have to go to work, I’ve got a shift at the bar tonight. Thank God the place can't fit 250 people. Hi, mom Yeah, yeah, I just got in. Yeah I saw the thing about the gatherings. Yes, we’re gonna be careful. I know it’s not like Drummond. MARCH 23rd 2020 : DAY 12 Today, I have made the decision... to close shut down all businesses and all workplaces... except for essential services until April 13th. We are now in a situation where, in reality... the province will be on pause for 3 weeks. Yeah, but spending 3 weeks alone at home... Meh, it’s not like I’m normally seeing a whole lot of people, you know? And you, how's it going at the residence? Ah, don't get me started. Mrs. Gauthier won’t stop stealing my marshmallow cookies. Don't laugh. She's really annoying. I told the staff many times and they don’t do anything. Well, don't make yourself sick over it. If you want I can send you a few boxes... we can put a lock on them to be sure. Why won’t you bring them to me in person, hm? I haven’t seen you since Christmas, I think? Yeah, but... Christmas wasn’t that long ago, and you know I can’t with COVID and all. I can’t wait for them to give us a break with that. If I at least had a tablet, we could see each other when I call, hm? Any news from your brother? It’s been a while since he’s called me. I don’t know, I think he’s still in Mexico. What a knucklehead. Trudeau is shutting the borders, does he wanna be stuck there or what? You’ll have to ask him. Mrs. Gauthier, no! Christ! What’s wrong? Nothing. Just a bunch of girls in lockdown trying to make a quick buck by getting naked online. What a good flavour. I give ‘em two weeks. I thought you stopped doing that? Nah, I just said that so your Christmas party wouldn’t be even more weird. Anyway, your room won’t pay itself. Be careful, okay? I promise. Do you still love me? Don’t be stupid. MARCH 24th 2020 : DAY 13 I understand that some people might be stressed. Usually, we don’t have our kids at home... elders who usually get visitors, are now all alone. I know that some people have lost their jobs... they’re wondering when and if they’ll get their job back. I know that some entrepreneurs invested in their businesses their entire life... and now they are wondering : "Have I lost everything I’ve built?" So it’s normal to feel stressed. The stronger we act now, the faster we’ll get out of this situation. So for today's numbers, we have 1013 new cases... So they told me : "Call supervisor... you can do that from home by phone or by Zoom." I’ve installed everything. During the day, I’ll work in the living room and you can have the whole bedroom to yourself. Oh I won’t miss going to the office. I’m so fed up of hearing Jean-Philippe and his endless monologues. Anyway, I think this whole lockdown business will be over faster than we think. Sam, I’m at my mother’s right now. Okay, so when will you be home? Around 7, 7:30? It’s not gonna work. Okay, I can wait until 8, but I’m already starting to get hungry. I'm not coming back tonight. I think I need a break. A break? Like, a vacation? Hmm, no, no. Like, a break from us, to think about what we really want. Okay. Hmm, yeah, eeh... Yeah, why not? So we can reconnect stronger after, right? How much time do you think you need? Well, I think the two week lockdown would be a good start. I’ll come by to get some clothes. Bye! PAINTING MATERIAL, HOME OFFICE, VEGAN CUISINE MAYA what I'm saying is, all of this is temporary. MARCH 25th 2020 : DAY 14 We all wanna make more cash. We all wanna make more cash. I don’t care what you say. Except if it brings me more cash. I got mind on my money, money, money.... I’ll be back home later than usual. Yeah. What? Because I have more deliveries today, papi. What do you want me to say? I dunno. I dunno, wait a sec. Wait! Yes, hello? Yes, hi ma’am. It’s your delivery. Leave it at the door. I’ll come down. And take care of yourself. Thanks, ma’am. You too. Bon appétit and have a nice day. Thank you, sir. And everything will be okay. Yes, Dad? I don’t have time to talk now. I’ll be there as soon as I'm done. Anyway, you have all you need. You have your dinner, your TV, you have everything. Okay, see you later. Bye. I can’t do this anymore. MARCH 26th 2020 : DAY 15 It’s important if we want to win the battle... to follow the rules. I have been told that more and more people are staying at a distance of 1 to 2 meters from other people. That’s what’s important, that’s what we must do. And if we do that, well everything will be okay. Unfortunately, we’ve had 2 more deaths... Are you sure it's in here? I can't find it. Never mind, just check if you can find my bathrobe. I found Willy. Do you remember Willy? Yeah, look in the... I think you slept with it for two months after we came back from Tadoussac. Hey, at the bottom of the box, can you see my black top and my nightie? You sleep in a nightie at your mom’s? Take my jean shorts too, and I think that’s it. You’re taking a lot of things for a short break. When are you coming back? I don't know, I just wanna have my stuff with me, just in case. I’ll call you back. Bye. But, Maya... Maya, wait! - Maya! - Careful, Sam. 2 meters! - Come on, babe. It’s just us. - I’m sorry, but it’s the law. No, the law says that people from the same household can see and touch each other. We’re not from the same household. Oh, stop! It's not because you slept 2 days at your mom's... I don’t want to anymore. What do you mean? No. What do you mean, no? No, it’s not what you want. Oh because you know what I want? No, that’s not what I meant. It’s because of the pandemic, you’re gonna lose your job. I know you feel insecure. - But baby, let’s go home! - Sam, you’re in your own little world sometimes. We can make a list of things to work on. A list of things to work on. - Yeah. - You want a list of your things to work on? Controlling. Irritating. Inflexible. Selfish. Self-centered. Doesn’t listen. Selfish and self-centered, isn’t that the same thing? Maya, wait! Do you want Willy? SELFISH. INFLEXIBLE. CONTROLLING. IRRITABLE. DOESN’T LISTEN. MARCH 27th 2020 : DAY 16 Oh, you changed it. Still listening to the same music, aren’t you fed up? Don't you want a little change? We were expecting to enter a new, more critical stage. As you'll see, today's results demonstrate that. Today, we have 10 more deaths. You see this? Now, you understand why I was so busy at work these days? By the way... I’ve accepted their offer to work more hours, so... you'll need to get used to me coming home late like yesterday. You understand? Papi... You have to help me a little, it can’t go on like this. I need to go or else I’m gonna be late. Where did I put my keys? Have you seen my keys? They were just there. Papi! Where are you going? You wanna get sick or what? You’re not allowed to go out. What don’t you understand? Yes, there, there, there. Okay, lock. Lock! Thank you. Here's your dinner right here, like this. Your music... See you tonight, okay? I'll be home late, no need to call me. Come on! Fucking car... Dammit! Motherfucker. You old piece of shit! MARCH 28th 2020 : DAY 17 Look, this is how we do it... The best is water and some soap. This is just in case you don’t have any. - Don’t forget between the fingers. - No, you’re right. - Don’t forget, under the nails. - What you can do is sing a song... Hey, Fanny! It’s Guillaume. Yes, I know. - How are you? - I’m okay, but... I’m busy with Laura right now, can I call you back later? Well, I just wanted to invite you to a Tiger King online watch party. Already watched it, you guys are late, it came out 5 days ago. But, anyway, can I call you back later when we’re done? Okay, catch you later. Did you know that 500 hours of content are added every minute on YouTube? Really? You’ll look really hot. He’s gonna miss you even more. He’s already pretty insistent about meeting in the flesh. And you don’t want to? I do... but it's no. You know, seeing a person or two to pass the time... it’s not really that risky. Laura, you told me you weren’t seeing anyone... and now you have your hands in my face. No, look... I’m only seeing one girl right now... and anyway, she’s as confined as we are, so there is no danger. She’s just coming for a short visit. Laura, she’s coming here? For the past 3 weeks I’ve been telling Guillaume we can’t see each other. It’s not the same at all. She lives alone... and your dude lives with a bunch of idiots. I never said idiots. Look at me. That’s it. Done, you’re ready. - Go fuck on Zoom now. - Yuck... Just be careful. I worry about you. Yes, mom. - Yo, hey Fanny! - Guillaume, hi. It’s so cool that you’re here. It’s like a fourth date, but online, though. What's going on at your place? It seems like there are people over. Ah, my roommates organized a small get-together with friends. We’re drinking, dancing, we’re having some fun. I didn’t invite you because I know you’re scared. Guillaume? You froze a little. No. No, I’m just looking at you. You’re... you’re... You’re so pretty. It’s been so long since we saw each other. I would love to kiss you. Oh really? Kiss me where? On your neck. I’d kiss you everywhere. On your breasts... I’d french kiss you. - I’d grab your ass! - Guillaume, no! Sorry, I went too far. It’s been so long. Why don't we see each other anymore? What's up, man! Who are you? Come join us. She’s really hot. Two seconds, Chuck is gonna chug a 20oz of Vodka live! Oh it’s you. What are you doing here? Good evening, miss! I’m here to deliver you some hugs and kisses. Can you please open the door? Daniel, I have the impression you don’t understand what’s going on. I work in a high-risk zone. If I get close to you, I could contaminate you, and you might contaminate your father after. No, stop. I'll never get it from you. You take everything so lightly. A father and mother are irreplaceable… I can tell you, I know what I’m talking about. I don’t want to have that on my conscience... especially since his health is so fragile. You’re not the only one, Malika. I also know what it's like to lose a mother. And you don’t hear me talking about conscience, and blah blah blah... Look... I just came over to surprise you because I love you. I know, I love you too, Daniel. That's why I want to protect you. Look, we’ll see each other as soon as it’s over, okay? Come here. Come here. And please, take care of yourself, okay? Ya. Okay. - Okay, bye. - Go home. MARCH 31st 2020 : DAY 20 RÉMI BEAUREGARD IS CALLING. Rémi? Hey, sis! Are you in the middle of a live show? Want me to call you back later? No, no. I was just taking a nap. Yo often nap dressed like that? Look, gimme a break. I’ve been doing shows for 10 hours straight. We don’t all have the luxury of being in Punta Cana. Cancun. And I’ll let you know that we’re in quarantine here also, so... At least the resort is quite accommodating. It helps to forget that we’re stuck inside. The lockdown sure looks tough in your corner of the world. Well... Actually, that’s partly why I’m calling. Living here isn't cheap, and... Calm down! I haven't even asked for anything yet! Yeah, but you always do this to me. "I don’t have any acting gigs." "My dubbing session was cancelled." "I’m waiting on 4 paychecks." Look, it’s not like it’s my fault for christ’s sake! It’s not mine either. How much? Can you at least help me with my share of mom’s rent this month? Please? I paid for January. We split February and March. I can pay for April, but I’m starting to be fucking broke too... Wait... Wait, we never split February and March. What are you talking about, I sent you my share both times. Well, I never got it. I thought you were paying for everything since the beginning of the year. What's this? I don’t know, ma’am. It’s your delivery. Come back here! Christ. Oh God dammit! I ordered this 3 months ago. Can you send it back? I’m sorry, ma’am, but I can’t take it back. I only opened the box. Yeah but, because of COVID, any package that’s been opened... Because of COVID... It’s not like she freaking spit in the box. Yeah! Look! Plastic! Listen, ma’am, I have other deliveries to make. You want her to drench the package in Purell? Yeah, I’ll wrap it in toilet paper, man! Two ply, man! Two ply! With fucking aloe! Hey sis, you left me on the porch. APRIL 5th 2020 : DAY 25 Today, I want to be realistic... I am thus announcing... that businesses that are non-essential... that we had closed until April 13th... will be closed until May 4th. Good point, Jean-Marc. So, in your e-mails, you will find a "client crisis" response plan suggested by the service... and the most important thing is... we stay positive. We reassure the client and we tell them that it’s not the right time to move their assets. WORKING OUT Yes, how can I help you Nathalie? SPONTANEITY Sir, wait! Thank you for everything you do. You are an essential worker and without you, society would crumble. EMPATHY I came to Montreal to cut hair in the Mile-End... and now I’m styling my roommate’s hair in the deep end of Hochelaga. - Great! - Well... - What else would you do anyway? - Yeah. As long as it's not so you can run and meet somebody else. Laura, fuck! I’m sorry, it just didn’t work with the other person. You can’t force these things. If you keep on dating, we'll have to stay away from each other. Oh come on, calm down. We’ve known each other since grade school and you’ve never spoken to me like this. I need warmth, you know? And you, for your part… you should relax a little. You are starting to sound like your mom. I’m done with your hair, by the way. Well good! You’ll have done something with your day. Thanks. Bye. Hello. Fanny. Guillaume? I was in the neighbourhood and I guessed you’d be at your apartment. You know... I hear there is a virus going around. Guillaume, you okay? Yeah, it's just a little cold. Could you let me in? We could catch up. I made you banana bread with chocolate chips. You really won’t let me in, huh? Nope, sorry. I guess we’ll see each other after the pandemic? Bye. - Surprise! - What are you doing? - I wanted a little kiss. - No! Come on, Fanny! - Yuck! Yuck! Yuck! Yuck! - Come on, it’s just a little joke. Fanny! What are you doing? - Go away! - Okay, I’ll leave for real. Go away! - Let's keep in touch. - Yes. Yes, mom? No, I didn’t go out today. I’m not seeing anyone, I promise. APRIL 11th 2020 : DAY 31 We learned at 8 o'clock last night... On March 26th, a first patient was sent to the Jewish General Hospital... tested positive for COVID-19 and deceased. On March 29th, 3 days later, the CIUSSS communicated... Calm down girl, it's probably a mistake. "We regret to inform you that your mother was moved." That doesn’t sound like a mistake. Well, it’s rather vague "was moved". - Maybe she just switched rooms. - No, no. It’s because we haven’t paid in months. Wait, you didn’t pay for April? I don’t have the money! - Did you call the residence? - No one is answering. And if you went there instead? They won’t let anyone in. We don’t have to go in. Why are you scratching yourself so much? Nothing to it. There are a lot of mosquitos in Mexico. - Shit. - What? There she is! There she is! Heartless bastards! Kicking people out in the middle of a pandemic. Aren’t you ashamed? Yeah! What? Hey don’t mess with us, lady, we know what you’re doing with your residents. Okay, what’s going on here? We wanna know: where did you move our mother? - I don’t even know... - Our mother! Where is our mother? Your mother? Who's your mother? What's your mother's name? Denise Beauregard. Do you have a picture of her? You don’t have a picture of your mother. Hey oh, tone it down with the shaming! You can’t even remember the name of your residents, so... Look, I was just transferred here last week... and I just finished a double shift, okay? I’m totally exhausted, okay? So pardon me if I can’t remember a name... off the top of my head, especially when... when someone... confronts me like this in a parking lot. Okay, okay, I’m sorry. Wait. I’ll get back to you, okay? - What? - I’ll get back to you, okay? Dammit, where is it? Can you tell us what this e-mail means? Wo, you just came out a long term care facility, so... There was a mistake in your e-mail. It’s incomplete. It should have said that your mother was moved to a red zone. What does that mean? It means your mother has been infected with COVID-19. I’m very sorry. Excuse me. Can you give this to my mom? You can tell her it’s an early birthday present. Thank you. So? What did she say? APRIL 16th 2020 : DAY 36 So today, sadly, we have 143 new deaths. Of course, I’d like to extend my heartfelt condolences... to the families of the deceased. The view from here should take your mind off everything that’s happening. It’s not the park, but it's better than nothing. And I think that from here, you can... you can discover new planets. Maybe even discover aliens? Finally, my paycheck came in. We all wanna make more cash. We all wanna make more cash. I don’t care what you say. Except if it brings me more cash. Farewell, to my old car! Look, Dad. Now that’s a car, eh? Here, like this? And once you have your picture, you'll send it to us or did you think... you'd share your art directly on Facebook? No, no, I'm just using the picture as a model for my next painting. Oh okay! And then I'll put the painting on Facebook. - Alright, you can take your places. - Okay. Please stand in the middle. Hmm, yeah, like that. EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY So, what’s going on with you? I’m doing really good, honestly. Hey, have you ever wondered what you could become or… I dunno, do if you were completely free? Hey Claude, your hand on Dom’s shoulder, please. - Yes. - Great. Well... Right now, it's not as if we're completely free. You know, we’re stuck with the kids around the clock, so…. We're in our heads. I dunno, I see it as a kind of mindset thing. In any case, I saw what happened to me as an opportunity... a way to become a better person. Okay... Oh yeah, Dom... - Put your arm around her waist. - Okay. - Yeah, more in the middle. - Like this? Cross your flowers, please. - Oh, like this? -Yes, higher. Oh yeah. This will be good! Don’t move. Nice. And do you guys have any news from Maya? Yeah, now and then. - We see her at the market. - That’s right. You? No, but since her mother lives close by.... I thought I’d pass by to give her this. - Oh! - I made it myself. It’s, hmmm.... It’s touching. You don’t think it will mess you up to see her? Oh no, I’m fine with it, really. It’s a good thing, what happened to us. But does she know that... you’re going to see her? - No, it’s a surprise. - Oh... Maybe not a good idea. She might not be alone. Well, she’ll be with her mother, but... What, like with who else? Well... We’ve seen her a few times and she was... walking, hand in hand... with... someone. Oh okay. Okay yeah. Cool, cool, cool. Ah well it’s all good. I’m glad for her, I guess. She's a girl who's had a hard time with being alone. So I think that it will be good for her. It’s cool. - Are you sure you’re okay? - Yeah, totally fine. Everything... Everything will be okay. Sam. Everything will be okay. You had a good job at the hair salon with Nicole. Working with your favourite aunt, what more can you ask for? Now, you’ll end up on the street because of your overpriced apartment... and the hair salons that reopen. It’s serious in Montreal, nothing like in Drummond. Nobody is infected here. Well, almost nobody. But we don't have it as bad as your area, Fanny. You should come back, you're not well over there. Oh, and I forgot to tell you…. I got my hair cut last week at Nicole’s. Kevin’s mom was there. Apparently he’s single again. Anyway, I thought it clicked between you two. Hey. Mom, I’m sorry, I’ll call you back. Yes? Hi. Sorry, I’m your downstairs neighbour. Listen, I’m sorry to have to tell you this, it’s a bit weird, we haven’t met before, but... I have bed bugs. In my apartment, you know? Bed bugs. A bed bug infestation. What the fuck, Fanny? There are bed bugs. - There are bed bugs? Yuck! - Eww, ew, ew, ew! The neighbour said it was an infestation, apparently. Fuck, check the seams. They get into the seams. Hey, I’m really sorry, I didn’t know. - I swear, I didn’t know. - It’s okay, I’ll be back. Wait, don’t go! I’ll call you back, okay? That fucking slob, I knew it! That guy's disgusting! Why are you looking at me like that? Go check your room! So gross! Fuck, this sickens me! APRIL 20th 2020 : DAY 40 Our national urgency... continues to be the situation in our long-term care facilities, in our residences for the elderly, in all sectors where there are vulnerable people. We’re still missing, at this moment... - More that 2,000 employees in these facilities. - The mask. There are about a hundred doctors that answered our call for help. - The visor. - But we need more then than. I spoke on the phone Saturday night... with the President of the Federation of Physicians... Hi Daniel. How are you? Hey, you look good with a mask. Yeah. Yeah, I'm alright. Listen... You were right last time. I was listening on the radio and they were saying that... the long-term care facilities were hit hard. Listen, that’s exactly why I’m calling you. What is it, did they find cases where you are too? No, it’s... Listen. Actually, I'm the one who's been infected. They tested the whole team and... - They just told us that... - No, it can’t be. Don’t say that, Malika. Are you sure? It’s okay. I’m young, I don’t have any symptoms. I’ll survive. I just need to respect the quarantine and everything will be fine. Babe... I know you’re courageous and all and I know you’ll stay strong, but... If you need anything, don’t hesitate, okay? What you can do for me... is to take care of yourself and of your dad. Don’t work too hard, he needs you by his side. I’m gonna go lie down. I love you, Daniel. I love you too, babe. Shit. Fuck! MAY 10th 2020 : DAY 60 Hello, mom? Hello, mom! Happy birthday! I tried calling, but... no one answered. Did you get the laptop I sent you? I tried contacting you on Facebook, but... that didn’t work either. I’m sorry, I don't understand. Hey, mom! Mom, I brought you some marshmallow cookies! I got the strawberry ones, that’s the ones... Raspberry! Those are the ones you like, right? I also brought some of the plain ones, and uh... I... They also have coconut ones now. Ma’am! Ma’am. You can’t be here. But it’s my mom’s birthday. I haven't seen her in months. I’m sorry. Hey, mom, I’ll come back next week, okay? Mom? Mom, I love you. I’m sorry! MAY 26th 2020 : DAY 76 Shopping will have to be done respecting... So, gang, let’s not forget when we speak to the client... we reassure them, make them understand that at the moment... we are totally in control of the situation. Everything is fine. We are focused on... We are focused on their financial security. And, uh... Nothing will stop us from... The boaters would have seen it near St-Irénée. Though it can survive some time in fresh water areas... this type of cetacean does not usually venture so far downstream. According to Whales Live, this phenomenon is considered to be totally unusual. Citizens who spot the animal... are invited to contact the St-Lawrence whale interpretation centre... JUNE 1st 2020 : DAY 82 Hello? Oh, hi, Jean-Philippe. How are you? Yes, I have 5 minutes. I’m quite busy, but it’s no problem. How’s it going? Uh, nope, I didn't look at my e-mails. Okay. No, no, I understand. It’s an exceptional situation, but... Really, half of the department. Okay. Can I at least come and pick up my stuff at the office? No, of course, I guess not. Well, you can send it to the same address. Yes. Fine. Thank you. You okay? Yeah, I'm good. I've told you before, if I lock you in here... it's to protect you. You hear me? You understand what I’m saying? You go out, and you die. I'd rather die than be locked up like this. Imprisoned by my own son. I’d rather die. - Hi Malika. - Hi. - How are you? - Good, and you? - I’m okay. - Hey, I got my results. And? I’m going back to work tomorrow. You never stop, you. You know I’m built for this, it’s the only thing I’m good at. We talked about this, I wouldn't change careers... just because my job's become more risky. Yeah, um, speaking of risks... I know it's risky to move my father into a long-term care facility right now, but... He can’t stand being locked in alone by himself all day. If it goes on like this, it won’t end well. Listen, a sick man... needs affection, human contact. It’s not by leaving him all alone all day that he will get that. Wait, I give him more than that. I work, I make money... If I quit my job to take care for him, what will he eat? Daniel, you're always so sensitive when it comes to money. Won’t you change your tune just for once? I know you’re doing the best you can and all... but you can’t do both. At least, you can’t do it alone. Get some help. Everyone has to pitch in so we can beat this. I’m even asking for the media's help to find 10,000 people. 10,000 people that will sign up in the next 2 weeks... to participate in a 3 month long training program... from June 15th to September 15th... I’ll cut this for you, It’ll be easier. These people, evidently, will be crucial... to finally solving our problems in our long-term care facilities. - Many governments... - Is it good? - ...are responsible, including ours. - You like it? I think all Quebecers will agree with me... we don't ever want to relive what happened in our long-term care homes. If you can't go in a long-term care home... It’s the long-term care home that will come to you. With a possible second wave, we have to act with urgency. BECOME AN ORDERLY IN A LONG-TERM CARE FACILITY JUNE 6th 2020 : DAY 87 MISSED CALL : MOM LAURA : AT JULES FOR A FEW DAYS. ENJOY. Last time I saw you, you didn't look so good. No, I know. I was pretty intense. You did good not letting me in. Did you try my banana bread? Yuck, no. Yeah, fair enough. Listen, Guillaume, I’m really happy that you called, but... I think I still need to be alone for a while. But Fanny, I’m top in shape now. You know, it would be fun to see each other, no? It has nothing to do with you. I just need to be alone. Okay. Take care of yourself. I’ll try. Bye. Anyway, your mother would be proud of you. I was saying, your mother would be proud of you for organizing this. Thanks. But... Is the priest arriving soon? I don't know, he's supposed to be here at 4. Hey Rémi. I was expecting you to be more tanned. Well, it's because they won’t let us go out. Look, seriously, can we talk about something else? We’re at a funeral. In any case, hmm... For me, your mother, was really my favourite aunt. - Thanks. - Thanks. She was such a generous woman. Thanks. She was a wonderful woman. Yeah. Thanks. Speaking of generosity... I would have liked to buy an urn... and a spot in a columbarium for my mom, but... I can't afford it with my Emergency Response Benefit cheque. Bunch of cheapos! Rémi. - Calm down. - Hey fuck off! It's hard on us too, okay? - Marie-Lou, I didn't raise you like that. - Oh, come on now. Your husband is a banker. A fucking banker! What about you, uncle, are you gonna chip in? Well, I could give $20 if need be. Wow, we’ll go far with that kind of money! No, I didn’t order anything. Am I at 1724 Dufresne street? No, here it’s 1726, 1724 is upstairs. But on the door is says... The door number is on the right. So you have to ring the buzzer on the right. Sorry, sir. Rémi Beauregard, you bastard! You’re in Montreal? Listen, Marianne, I... Look, I’ll explain everything. Christ. I’m going crazy because of mom... and you, you’re chilling at home in a fucking fake taco bar set? What’s your excuse this time, huh? Fuck! TO MARIANNE AND REMI.MOV Marianne... Rémi... - Oh my God! - Sorry, ma’am! I didn’t want to... I was about to knock. It’s for a delivery. I was so not expecting to see someone. Sometimes, I think to myself: "Thank God I'm not in the United States". Well, um... Technically, I'm not supposed to give it to you directly, so I'll... I’m going down. Oh, it’s from my mom. You're quite lucky that she's still here. We should never forget that our parents love us... even when times are hard. Anyway... Good evening, ma'am. Thank you. You too. FANNY, FOR WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOUSE. I KNOW I CAN BE ANNOYING, BUT IT'S BECAUSE I LOVE YOU. MOM JUNE 7th 2020 : DAY 88 Did you finally find someone to help you at home? Yeah, I confirmed with her and she's starting on June 15th. What’s really nice is that she also comes from Haïti, so... at least she'll be able to handle his old music all day. Everything will be okay. You’ll get through this. The new car will have to wait. - No choice. - But you... Are you ready for the training? Aren’t you scared by this career change? No, not at all. It’s like I’ve found a new calling, you know? I’ve never felt this ready for anything! Daniel, the humanist. The pandemic really shook you, eh? There’s no doubt. Yeah, yeah, keep mocking me. I also have good news. Yeah? Yeah, didn’t I tell you? No. I got a promotion. I’m becoming head-nurse. - Really? - Yep. - No! - Yes! That's awesome! - I’m so proud of you, really. - Thanks. You deserve it, babe. Wait. I have something that’s even better. Yeah. Not bad. But what do you think about this? RACISM IS A VIRUS And with your smile, that's even nicer. No, it’s pretty. - Unity is... - Strenght! - Unity is... - Strenght! Unity is... After giving us a breathtaking aquatic spectacle for the past 10 days... the mystery lingers around the humpback whale that spent an entire week... swimming around the Montreal area. According to the local emergency network on marine mammals... the whale was last seen yesterday morning. One of the main risks that this whale could encounter... is be to be struck by a ship... or to head into a dead-end. The experts from Fisheries and Oceans Canada... are patrolling the river in order to find it. NEW LIFE - Normally, at this time of year... the whale would be in the area around Tadoussac. We are seriously hoping... that the whale has headed up the river... to go back amongst its own. The patrol is counting on the collaboration of the public. At 10 metres long, weighing 10 tons... and 400 km away from its habitat... This animal, younger than 3 years old... was never tagged by the scientists. EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY This morning, the humpback whale that had spent a few days... swimming in Montreal waters... was found dead in the vicinity of Varennes. An autopsy will be needed to determine the cause of death. Since being last seen in the Pointe-Aux-Trembles area... the humpback whale had not given any sign of life. The carcass of the mammal was towed away to the Sorel-Tracy pier... JUNE 19th 2020 : DAY 100 Nice view. - I wanted to tell you... - Shut up. Marianne... Rémi... You’re the two best things the good Lord ever sent me. I don't know if I’ll beat this virus, but... Just... just in case... I wanted to leave you one last message, I know that both of you are real tough and independant... and that you don't need anyone to be happy. If you knew how scared I am that you end up all alone... like me. You deserve so much better. So much more. Stop keeping everyone at a distance. That also means, from one another. You only have one brother and one sister... Does she say anything other than lecturing us? She finishes by saying: Love one another... just as I have loved you." - Amen. - Amen. Christ, she’s right. Mom is dead and you can’t even give me a hug. I... I have bed bugs. I swear. Do you think she'll find the water cold? You know you're not allowed to do that? Throwing ashes in the river, it’s illegal. No, no. - Calm down. - Okay, okay. That’s a nice whale. Is it a friend? It’s our mother. My condolences. -Thanks. - Thanks. Thank you! So, how does it feel to come out for the first time in 3 months? You see? You didn’t miss anything. It’s still the same city. Well, they still haven’t moved Mariani beach here. Someday, I’d love to see the sea again.
