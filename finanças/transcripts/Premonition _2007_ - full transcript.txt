No, don't do that, they just fell asleep, leave it. I was thinking about, um, everything we need to get done. Tomorrow we should probably start looking into funeral arrangements. And then, um, you know, just see where you are in terms of insurance. I'm not ready for that, Ma. Nobody is ready for any of this, dear. But you'll be surprise at how strong you're gonna be.. You know, when I lost your dad.. I can't stop thinking about our serving platter. What serving platter? You know, the big one on the top shove. The one that his folks gave us. I can't reach that. Jim, Jim does that for me. Nobody expect you could get everything done in the first few days, dear. I-- I'm pretty tired. I'm gonna go lie down in the dent. I'll get some sheets out of the closet.

Did we talked yesterday? Yeah, we talk everyday. No, I mean, um.. Did I leave you a message? I don't think so, why? Wait a minute, hang on, I'm the one with the crisis, okay? Are you sure you're all right? Yeah. Everything's cool with you and Jim? Yeah, everything is exactly the same. So, how was everybody's day? Mine was okay. Kinda boring. Yeah, kinda boring. Boring, huh? Jim? Lithium. Here she is. Hi, honey. Did you get some rest? What's going on? Hey, how are you feeling, but.. Why don't you go upstairs and let's get some clothes. Are you going to go upstairs and get dressed? Where are the girls? The girls are fine, dear. The girls are fine, honey. Don't worry about the girls. This isn't right. What is it?

I wonder what it like when daddy died? I don't know, baby. I wasn't there. So, how did you know he died then? You all right? What if this is a mistake? What do you mean, "a mistake"? People just don't day one day and they're okay the next day, that's all. It's not a mistake. Oh, Ok, Mum, did you see inside the cascade? No, I didn't see, but it doesn't..

Just take the kids inside! Go ahead, go ahead with the kids. Linda? Linda? Hello, Mrs. Hanson. Ow, I just want you to know that everything's on schedule. I need you to open the cascade. No, no, no.

Jim left this world, a beloved person. His friends spoke about his kindness..

Mommy is sorry! Mommy is very sorry! Sir, sir, sir! Obviously she's never been corrected before.. Her husband was in a fatal car crash on Wednesday. I told her about it on Thursday. Wou, wou, wou, wou, hold on. Wednesday? That's strange, she showed up in my office on Tuesday. Claiming he was already dead or.. He's going to be.. She said he was going to die, before the accident? Yeah. You sure it was an accident? Hello, Linda. Please don't do this, I just wanna go home to my girls. Please don't do this. Please, Sir. Just let me go home to my girls.

People who know me, but I have never met. People like me? Yes. Seems a little complicated. Tell me about it. What about the Lithium bottle? I don't know, it's, it's, I don't know, I misplaced it somewhere. Look! I can't explain it, but I tought if somebody was trying to.. Trying to, drug you? Uhum. Why and who? I don't know, you tell me. I didn't prescribe it. But your name was on the bottle. Why do you think I came here? To get some help. Obviously, you're dealing with some inconsistencies. I wake up every morning to find my husband has died again.. I think that goes just a little beyond inconsistent. How do you feel.. During the times of his dead? What? I mean, what kind of emotions run trough you? Is it sorrow, resentment, relief? What are you saying? That's a pretty common day dream to imagine people being death. I'm not day-dreaming, okay? I wake up and he is dead. Except for today. Do you have any history of mental illness in your family? No. What about yourself, any episodes of psychosis? Memory lost? Judgment lapses? I don't want him dead! It was a car accident. Well, it's not a crime imagining it. I'm not imagining it. He's dead! Well, it is a little odd.. But the prescription was far that lift you.. Why? Because, that's probably the best thing for you right now. It'll help you cope. Do you think you can make it in to see me here tomorrow? Hey, look who's here! Hey, Bob. Is Jim here? Yeah, how come you don't come by to anymore? Hi. I need to talk to you. What is it? What's going on? I know I've been acting strange, but something wrong.. There's something very wrong. What is it?

Please, I really need you, can we just. I have to go to the sales meeting. Excuse me. Jim, we're waiting for you. I'm sorry. Who are you? I'm Claire Francis, you must be Jim's wife. Yeah, Linda. I've seen your pictures, it's nice to meet you. Claire is our new assistant manager. Your husband has been really helpful for the last few weeks. Guys, we're starting. Excuse me.

Yeah, like a princess. My two princesses. I tought you're gonna put up stickers? I did. I don't know, maybe, maybe I thought I did. Christ, Linda. What? Are you blaming me for this now? I've asked your mother to come and stay while I'm gone. What? Why? Just to help, you know? I don't need any help. Help take care of the kids. I don't need any help. Look, you can take a break. You know, some time for yourself. For what? Time for myself for what? So I could stop acting like a crazy person? What are you talking about, I never said.. You are not separating me from my kids. I'm a good Mom. Ok. Uhm. Thursday. I discover that Jim died. Monday. Jim alive. Funeral's on.. Saturday! What else.. Lithium, it's on Saturday. Except for today. Meet Dr. Roth on Tuesday. Saturday... Dr. Roth. Bridgette's cut happened on.. Bridgette! Bridgette! Mommy? Tuesday .. still open in Wednesday.. Wednesday.. You have one new message. When? Yesterday. Oh, God. Jim dies on Wednesday. What are you doing? Jim, don't go on this trip, please. I have to, I've waited all the year for this interview. Besides, it could be good for us, you know. Take a break from each other. Well, it might be a bigger break than need broken for. What if something happens to you? Something could happen to me on my way home from work. Should I stop working? You want me to beg? I will beg, please, just don't go, you have a children and you have a family. Why are you saying that? You think I've forgotten that? No, I haven't.. Because I haven't!

You need to be with the girls, you had the shock of your life yesterday. Tell me about it. Is there something we should be talking about? Something involving my husband? I've told you. I think you just did. He was going to cheat on me. What? Wait a minute, how did you know, how did you find out? I talked to her, she told me everything. When? Today. Oh, I'm sorry, are you still in shock? No. The whole thing is bad, the accident, the other woman, it's a mess.. I don't know if it's so bad. Maybe it's supposed to happen. What do you mean? Even though he didn't do anything yet.. The damage that it would have cost us, the girls.. Maybe it was enough what he was going to.. Are you listening to what you are saying? We were roommates, Annie. We were roommates, two girls... And my roommate was a liar. Well, as far as you mortgage, and your daughter's education should all be taken care of.. You know, Linda. I have to tell you, the timing of all this. 'Timing'? What do you mean, 'timing'? Jim stopped and he see me on Wednesday morning, right before.. Wednesday? Yes. And he seemed very anxious, like he wasn't quite sure of things.. And he kept talking about you, and the girls, and he said that.. No matter what happen, he wanted to make sure you're all okay.. And then he tripled his death benefit. I mean, it's on no problem. The police reports all confirm that it was an accident, so.. I'll just get this clear to the main office. And, um, I should have a check for you very soon. Nice view, huh? Yes, very. You have a family? I have two daughters, but, um.. It's no big deal, happens to a lot of people. They drive by here, just like you did, to see the houses by this beautiful lake.. Suddenly said to themselves: What a great place to start over. I moved here after my divorce. Really? Yeah, it's great. It's like a whole new life. Hello, I'm Dorothy Quinn. I know. Got it. Hi, honey. Hi, Mom. One for you. Cool! Thank you, Mommy. You're welcome. You know how much I love you, right? Linda? Yeah. I don't want to upset you. What is it, Mom? I know this is very difficult, but... I really do think we need to drive out to the funeral home, dear. I'll go with you. Oh, it's done. What? I already made all the arrangements. Oh. When are you thinking of having this.. The funeral is tomorrow, till Saturday. Saturday? Saturday. That soon? Yes, that soon. You okay, Hon? Hey, Mom. Uhum? If I let Jim die.. Is that the same thing as killing him? Honey, Jim's already dead. Good night, dear. Hot Sunday. All day long. Hey, you want to go take the girls out for a while? You know, you guys should spend some time together. You can have some fun. Yes, okay. That's a good idea. You girls want daddy to make you some pancakes for breakfast? Yeah! Hello, Father. Linda.. It's been a long time. I'm scared, Father. 1632, a Dutch trading company move off the coast of Carolina.. A hysterical woman claimed.. To have walked through the aftermath of a terrible hurricane that haven't happen yet. So, what happened? They hung her for being a witch. Two days later, the entire town was wiped out by a force of hurricane. It's awful. Let's get ahead to the 20th century. Boston, 1918. At the height of the influence of epidermic. A father told a friend he's been to the future.. He seen a grave of a two small children. Oh, my God. The autopsy showed that the children were never infected. He shot himself a week later. Who are these people, why did it happened? You see.. History's full of unexplained phenomena.. Nobody knows why. Some people tought, they suffered from what the ancients called.. "Blasphomare Absence Fudas" The dangers of the fatales. The fatales? Even spritiual. People who've lost their belief.. They are like empty vessels. They are more susceptible of having their life taken over by a force whose bigger than themselves. It's almost like a curse. Or a miracle. Yeah, but I don't believe in miracles. Everyday, we're alive can be a miracle. I doesn't feel that right, not for me. Father.. Something bad is going to happen. I need your help, I need your direction.. I need faith. Faith, it's just believing something behind yourself.. Something you can't feel, or smell, or touch.. Like hope.. Or love.. I believe I've let that all go. Maybe you should try and get it back again, huh? But if it's too late? It's never too late to realise what's important in your life.. To fight for it. I don't know what to fight for. He was on the highway, mile mark for 220. Mrs. Hanson? Ma'am? Who are these people? Why did it happened? History's full of unexplained phenomena. Bridgette, no, Bridgette! Nobody knows why. Open it up! Open it up! No! Obviously, you're dealing with some inconsistencies. Dangers of the fatales. I'm Claire Francis... Your husband has been really helpful for the last few days. How do you feel during the times of his dead? We don't want anyone getting hurt, do we? If I let Jim die.. It's never too late.. Is that the same thing as killing him? Inconsistencies. .. the same thing as killing him. You guys have a good time? Yeah, yeah, we got a great time. Good. Let me help you with that. Smell good. Oh, good girls. Nite. Good night. Good night. Hey, why don't you girls go give your dad another hug and say thanks. Okay, okay. What's this all about? Momma said to give you extra hugs. Extra hugs? Extra hugs and extra kisses. Now off to bed, go brush your teeth. Hey, girls. Why don't you tell daddy how much you love him. Love you, daddy! Me too! Well, thank you, ladies. Aren't you going to tell them? Tell them what? That you love them. You do love them, don't you? Of course I do. Then tell them. You girls know how much I love you, right? Huh? Right? I love you more than anything in the whole wide world. Mom too. More than anything? I do love your Momma.. I love her very much. Linda! What are you doing out here? Honey, let's go back inside. How did we get here, Jim? I miss you. I miss us. It's still an us, it's just different now, that's all. Why? Why is it different? I don't know why! What did you expect this to be like? Just the way we used to be. Linda, look at us. We're married, we got a house, a mortgage, two kids. Why do we have to talk about this now? Why can't we just go inside? Because we're running out of time! Watch out! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. You wanna tell me something? I had a dream you're going to die. That was only a dream. Everything's going to be fine. Hello. Annie, Annie what day is it today? It's, um, it's Wednesday.

I meant what I said in front of the girls the other night.. I just.. I want you to know that.. And.. Please remember it. Damn it, someone's calling, hold on. Is that you? Linda? Jim! I love you, honey. I need to tell you something. It's all right, I know about her, I know about Claire. You do? Yeah. I have to explain it, but.. Honey, honey, honey, listen..

You're healing so nicely. Why don't you guys go downstairs, I'll be there in a second, okay? Okay. Faith is just believing something behind yourself.. like hope, or love. It's never too late to realise what's important in your life.. To fight for it. I don't know what to fight for. Everyday we're alive, can be a miracle.
