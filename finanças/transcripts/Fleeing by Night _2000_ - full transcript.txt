Sir. Sir, are you all right? Mr. Hsu. Mr. Hsu. I'm going to stop the machine, Mr. Hsu. It's been a long time since I wrote. How are you? Knowing you will return this fall. Fills me with a certain happiness. What should I bring you for our first meeting? It's hard to believe. We know each other so well. Yet we haven't even met. Tell me what you miss the most. About home I've been away so long. That home is now stranger than abroad. Emotions people often perceive as natural aren't really that pure. Like homesickness or family love. Though I know its description. I have not been able to find its sound, color, or smell. Then there is love. What we all consider as love. To me is such an irony. My senses rely on touch. Like a bow pressing on strings and making a sound. I can hear it. And feel the vibration in my fingers and my chest. I don't live in a fantasy world. Your words shame me. I find myself willing to indulge in a fantasy world. Stories of loyalty and love. Yesterday I watched The Peony Pavilion. Again I wept. Compared to the people in my real life, I feel more familiar with the characters in the stories. Their joys and sorrows. Sometimes a simple phrase is enough to make me tear. I hope you will not find this ridiculous. I wouldn't. Perhaps when I return I shall plant a tear in my yard. So that later in my life I can also long for home. Pardon me. Elder brother, I'll take this to your room. OK. Letting an opera troupe stay in our house... how ridiculous! The Commerce Bureau is holding a conference in town. So all the inns are full. It's only for a couple of days. Endure a little. Are they blessing the stage today? Right. What's the main show? "Fleeing By Night." Great! Who's performing? Sir, the rooms in the east wing won't be enough. Then check out the servants quarters. Yes. Help them settle in. I have to go. Mother. Shaodung sent the telegram from Hong Kong. I'll pick him up. You might be engaged but there are still proprieties. Deshun. Coming! Tell them not to wander round the back. There are women in this house. Don't they have any etiquette? Yes. It's all your father's idea. Letting them stay at the house! Talisman of Good Fortune. The Stage-blessing Ceremony. Your tea, madam. Leave it. This noise is killing me! The show hasn't opened but we still have expenses. If you could speak to Mr. Wei. Just let us stay a few more days. All right. I'll speak to him about it. Thank you. These people are stranded here because of the rain. They've spent their entire fee. If we don't accommodate them, our theatre will have no show to put on. With all the businesses you have. You don't just rely on the theatre's income. My poor ears have suffered enough. Don't you like having a show right inside the house? Opera buff! Opera buff! They're all the same. Place them neatly. The rosette up there. Thank you. Right. Like that. Good. Ah! Miss. The rain has proven auspicious. The opening night is already sold out. I think I've told you before I must have been born with the clang of a cymbal. On my first birthday my father bought the theatre. So it was fated that I would be obsessed with opera. Prior to a show's opening. There is an unusual silence in the theatre. Skylights from all sides would be open. But opera only comes alive in the dark. When there is sunlight, the opera will hide itself. Yet I am always able to find the hidden pieces. Why did you run away? I don't know. Sir, Master Huang has bought out a third of the seats. It is said that in Beijing. He became enraptured by Lin Chung's performance. Greet him at once. Yes. Elder brother, your tea. Give a good performance. Set an example for your younger brothers. Arriving at Jade Lake, I see two kids guarding the gates. I will pluck a single strand of my hair. Which will turn into a sleeping bug and overcome them. So Shaodung is coming back. That's right. The boy left home when he was only eight. Your endurance was worthwhile. If it weren't for his father, my heart wouldn't have allowed it. That's enough. Let's watch the show. Ing'er. Come with us to pick him up tomorrow. You haven't even met each other. I plan to go. It's been a long time. Congratulations. Have a seat, please. After you, please. It's an excellent program. You are too kind. The best is yet to come. Oh? What's tonight's main attraction? - "Lin Chung Flees By Night." - "Lin Chung Flees By Night?" Excellent! - Please enjoy the show. - OK. It was him! I swear, I had never thought. That he would be the troupe's lead actor. To perform "Fleeing By Night". His calm features. Those eyes that were impossible to connect with. Even after witnessing his rehearsal. I still couldn't believe it. Bravo! Excellent! Bravo! What's keeping her? She probably needs to make up a bit. Be patient. Sorry. Cloud gesture! Don't look down! Display pose! Kick! Miss. How well you sing! I'm flattered. Waist straight! And level your shoulders! Kick higher! Over there! The one with the cello! Yes. Looks like him! Shaodung! Shaodung! Shaodung! Over here! Mother, please don't cry. We should be happy to see each other. Right I'm crying because I'm happy. This is aunt. This is Mr. Qian. Come in. Do come in. My things are everywhere. Such a mess. Have a seat. - Have a seat. - Thank you. Why are you laughing? Looking at you, I think of those letters. You've forgotten that behind those letters there is a person. I'm really happy that... there was an old friend to meet me at my home coming. Here, I even brought my old friend a gift. When will you play something for me? Something by Ba... - Bach. - Yes. - OK. - Bach. Another time then. Let me just get my things organized. - Sir, allow me, sir. - Ah? - It's all right. I can do it. - Allow me. - These are my things. - I'll do it. I'll do it. Very well. You do it. Please. No need to see me out. - See you soon. - OK. Uncle, I will leave now. Shaodung, take care. - How was it studying abroad? - It wasn't too bad. Go ahead. Uncle and auntie, we'll be on our way. Take care. The first time I received your letter I was genuinely surprised. All these years abroad. No one but my family wrote me. I elected to study English at the university. I needed someone to practice with. But in the end it was my Chinese that improved. I enjoyed writing letters to you. I never thought of you as my fiancee. Perhaps for this reason we were able to become very close. We've been so fortunate... Yet at the same time unfortunate. Mr. Lin. A gift of money from Master Huang. Please thank Master Huang for me. OK. I will leave now. OK... I will see myself out, please. Take care. Between Beijing and Tianjin there are many theatre troupes. With many good players. It's hard work to keep your head above water. Whether we can establish ourselves in Tianjin. All depends on you. Thanks for your elder brother. Thank you, elder brother. - Right here. - Oh. Miss, you're here. - Come in, please. - OK. It's so crowded. My father invited the Rungching Company from Beijing. It has many well-known actors. I don't need to see it when it's so crowded. No need to get tickets. Come with me. You like music, so you will definitely like Kun opera. Maid, come here. Quickly now. Sir, spare me. No. Stretch out your hand. Quickly. Stretch out your hand. That's too high. A little lower. Sit here for the moment. Sit down. Sit here? - We can see the stage from here. - OK. Father lent our box to his friends. Sorry, you have to sit here. In fact... if you really feel sorry, we could leave now. Maid, you are so cheeky. Sir, have mercy on me. I was just joking. Always cheeky, always punished. I'm always cheeky, always punished. So beat me, sir. Maid, you are asking for it. Let's go. - We're not watching it? - No. This spot isn't so bad. It's all right. Let's go. I have counted the hours. And my time is running out. In my flight from the government troops. There was only Lin Chung. I've always wanted to know what you really saw that first moment, when you set eyes on Lin Chung. It wasn't what I saw, but what I heard. I am sensitive to sound. I was instantly affected by the power of his voice. I asked myself where that sound came from. He was so far away, but his voice cut straight to my heart. I didn't understand the words, but I heard the voice of despair and anger speaking from his heart. The power of battling troops dissolved into desperate tears. Alone in the night, abandoned to the wilderness in his sorrow. I understood him. On that barren stage, without even a simple backdrop, he created a whole world. Following his movement, the look in his eyes, I was hypnotized, taking in all the images he conveyed. The mountain road, the temple gates, the cold moon and scattered stars. Escape was his only thought. Bravo! Bravo! A money tribute from Master Huang! A money tribute from Master Huang! You are invited to dine with Master Huang tonight. Mr. Wei has extended our contract for three months. That is some security for us. I'll take you backstage to meet him. Ing'er. Don't mistake me for an opera fan. I'm just... Just meet him. It'll be all right. It feels contrived I'm sure I'll meet him when the time is right. - You are really difficult. - I... Miss Wei, it's been a long time. You come almost every night, don't you? I never get tired of a good show. - And this is... - I... May I introduce you... to Hsu Shaodung. Ah, I've heard. The son of Jidung Bank's chairman, just returned from abroad. I'm Huang Zilei. Thank you. When you have time, allow me to give you a proper home coming. It's too much trouble. The opera is called... "Lin Chung Flees By Night". "Lin Chung Flees By Night". The actor who plays Lin Chung is... Lin Chung! - No, what I mean... - Sir, buy one, please. No, thanks. I'm asking his real name. His real name is Lin Chung. - His real name is Lin Chung? - Yes. He became famous playing the role so he took the name. Quick! Bring some medicine to sober him up. You are not married and you are already spending time together. He shouldn't treat you like one of those foreign women I've heard that they go about holding hands and even... Smack lips! Has he ever? Auntie. - Shaodung, it's you. - Yes. Goodbye. - Goodbye, aunt. - Goodbye. Mr. Hsu just returned from America, and has greatly taken by his performance. He'd like to meet Mr. Lin. Elder brother is still asleep. Last night he was a little drunk. I can go in to call... Don't disturb him. It is nothing important. Another time then. We'll be leaving now. Miss. He was just... I have to go to the theatre now. Sir. - You're home. - Yes. There was a phone call for you from the ministry... What did he really study in America, music or banking? What did he say about the internship with the bank? Give him some time. You... And this child! The road home is far. The road home is far. Who will support my mother and wife? My fate is uncertain. I don't know if I will live or die. Ah! I am drenched with fear. And my body burns. I feel my heart is on fire, thinking my wife is in danger, and my mother may be dying. My duty to parents will go unfulfilled. Lamentation! How does a hero express anguish? How does a hero express anguish? Hey, you're here I came to look for you. Have you two met? Let me introduce you. - He. - This... You don't need to introduce him. I am Hsu Shaodung. Mister Hsu. Just call me Shaodung. I don't know much about Kun opera, nor am I an opera fan, but I feel that your performance... Well! What a coincidence. Here we're meeting again. Mr. Huang. I didn't know Mr. Hsu was also an opera fan. I know nothing of opera. I'm just... Please. You are too modest. Miss Wei is your fiancee. You must know full well about the opera just by association. How about this... Come with Mr. Lin for supper. It'll be my treat. No, thanks. It is a rare opportunity. Perhaps we will party too late. Would Miss Wei be willing to join us? Another day. I have to take her home. All right. Then, Mr. Lin, shall we? Goodbye. Thanks. What's on your mind? Ing'er, do you think... maybe I could learn Kun opera? Don't laugh. I'm serious. Say it yourself. Me... You... Could you teach me something? Anything at all. She is ticklish. Have a look. Where are we going? Wherever we'll get to. Are you all right? Don't go too far, or it'll be dark before we return. All the better. We will then be "Fleeing by Night". The road home is far. The road home is far. Who will support my mother and wife? My blade white as snow by my side. My blade white as snow by my side. With every step I cry out in sorrow, following the long and winding road. Bravo! Why did you join the opera troupe? Where is your home? Do you go back often? I was an abandoned child, found and then raised by the troupe leader. I have no family, nothing I can tell you about. So I become whomever I play. Now I am Lin Chung. In the future, who knows? You should be proud of your achievement. As an opera singer? You are an artist. Artist. You definitely deserve the standing ovations that follow your performance. With music, acting and dance. All together. I have never seen this kind of theatre. Perform a bit. Who'd be a better audience than these mountains and ruins? Just a short piece. I, Lin Chung, was once the commander of 800.000 praetorian troops. The days I fought the invading barbarians, I should have been made a lord for that campaign. I had expected the rank of marquis, Instead I have become a bandit, and a traitor to my emperor. I am like a hawk freed from the glove. A rabbit released from its cage. A serpent breaking out of a net. To save the kingdom the villain escapes justice, for judges are not all truly just. Despite disheveled hair and ragged appearance, I will fight a battle that will make the heavens reel. Gaochiu! Your punishment shall shake the earth. Bravo! Bravo! Master Huang. Has Mr. Lin left? I will send someone for him... There is no need. This was his best performance... since he came to Tianjin. Director Chou, you've really established yourself here. Thank you. Master Huang... you take care. - Are the fish yours? - Yes. Would the fish taste good? - Good. - Good. - How about another one? - OK. Will you be afraid if I drive? No. Be careful. I'll be off. Shaodung. Would you have a cigarette on you? My memory of you is here. Please accept this, a small token of my gratitude. Have you found accommodation? A place right by the ancestral hall. They have already cleared it for us. We are greatly in debt to you and Mr. Wei. We'd never have made it otherwise. Thanks. Director Chou. Miss. In any space there is always a sacred spot for resonance. How about it? Is that good? If we find it, you will hear the very best music. - How did this happen? - Don't tell Shaodung. Who'd do such a horrible thing? I know. Ing'er. What do you think? Ing'er. Ing'er. Lin Chung... What's the matter? Nothing. I was playing the cello here just now. Did you listen? I did. I enjoyed it. Thank you. It was the only friend I made when I was growing up overseas. I have never had any. Am I not considered one? I think Master Huang is serious. He often books the whole theatre. Can't you figure it out? What can two grown men possibly do? Well, he adores him. It's fashion. Stop telling me about these filthy things! Actors. They thrive on adoration! It's perfectly filthy. The sooner they leave the better. What is it? Nothing. - Mr. Hsu. - Director Chou. How come you are not in the audience? I feel... it's even more interesting here backstage. I'm not in the way, am I? No. As long as you don't mind the crowd back here. I'll get those. Take these away. Make yourself comfortable. So someone has beaten us here again. - Master Huang, you're here. - Mr. Huang. Are you waiting on Lin Chung, Mr. Hsu? Yes. Then why don't we have supper together? I am not in the habit of taking supper, thanks. Won't honor us with his presence? Then I won't insist. You've exhausted yourself. Tonight was yet another great success. Come. Remove your makeup. My car is waiting outside. I think Mr. Lin is weary. Why don't you teach me a few things since you understand him so well? Mr. Hsu, if you have no other business... Lin Chung, if you don't want to go, just say so. What is this? I'm inviting Mr. Lin for supper. What does that have to do with him? What if I'm also inviting him for supper? Damn you for wanting to make things difficult. - Bastard! - Please, everyone... You may purchase the enjoyment of the theatre, but you don't have the right to purchase someone's freedom. He has the freedom to not go with you. Master... Well, Lin Chung? Just wait for me. I'll be there. I will wait. Master Huang, you take care. Please take care. Pour Mr. Lin a cup of liquor. Hurry up. Bottoms up! Here we go. Drink, drink. Mr. Lin, your singing was perfect. He is the best! Step on it! There are the cars waiting outside. Whose gear are you carrying? Where's your own? It's still inside. Go! Go back and get it. Put that away! Hurry up! Elder brother, I'll take it. Thank you for your hospitality. During this time... Lin Chung, you don't need to say these things. Then there is nothing else for me to say. Can't you join another troupe? You are famous now. You can go anywhere you like. As long as I'm performing, it'd be the same wherever I go. Why don't you stand up for yourself? After all, he relies on you to survive. But he raised me. And he is my mentor. Shaodung... how is he these days? When you see him, please give him my regards. Come here. I wan to introduce Mr. Li to you. This is Aunt Li. Their business goes well. You should learn from them. This is Mr. Zhu. He studied finance in America. Banking management. Won't you even greet me now? There is no need to be like that. Goodbye, Miss Wei. - Goodbye, Miss Wei. - Goodbye. What is going on? I've already sent people to look for him. Have another look around upstairs. Refund! I want a refund! Ing'er. Was Shaodung with you? I knew something was up, so I didn't say anything. - What's the matter? - You need to ask? Shaodung didn't go home. His parents came look for him. I have warned you not to spend so much time... Are you listening to me? Forget it. Let's stop. I don't think we will find a gas station out here in the wild. We'll sit in the car. You have nice hands. Lin Chung! Lin Chung! Lin Chung! Lin Chung! Lin Chung! My dreams return to that far off balcony. Lin Chung? Lin Chung? Go! Get out! Whatever happens, doctor, you must save his voice. Come. Take your medicine. Take it and you'll recover soon. They've changed the program yet again. Miss. Good to see you. I heard Mr. Lin was sick. My father sent me to see him. We are honored. Please convey my thanks. Can I see him? Now isn't the best time. When he is better, I will make sure to have him thank you in person. All right. Please tell Lin Chung I visited. I hope he recovers quickly. After all, he is your money tree. Without Rungching, our theatre can look for other troupes. If Lin Chung couldn't perform, it'd be difficult to find his replacement. Wouldn't it? Thank you for your concern, Miss. These apprentices I have nurtured will count on your support in the future. The scars on Lin Chung's body... were they also nurtured by you? What is going on? It has nothing to do with Ing'er. The Hsus will think it has. Shaodung visited us frequently. He always claimed it was to see Ing'er. If we had brought the wedding forward... Now the Hsus may even want to break the engagement. It's all your fault. Mr. Chao. How are you? Mr. Li. Hello. Uncle Hsu. Mr Huang. How are you? - Come, sit down. - No. I can't stay. I just came over to say hello. My father asks after you. Thanks. I trust he is in good health. Just as always. As long as he has his pipe, he is fine. By the way, I picked up this tennis racket the other day. The name on the racket seems to be your son's. You knew each other? No. But I read the news in today's paper. Only then did I realize the one who was chasing after the actor... Was your son! How could a member of our family do such a thing? You have humiliated each and every one of us! How are we to face others in this town? Are you being punished? No. I'm waiting for Brother Jiu. Where's he gone? Director called for him. Who is it? How many more of us are you going to wreck? Put this on. What do you plan on doing? Don't forget... Who has given you this life! Then I will use this life to repay you! How dare you! How dare you! Elder brother... Elder brother! Let go, Elder brother! He's dead. - Go. Go quickly. - Hurry and leave! Go quickly. Ing'er! Ing'er! What is it? I killed him. I've killed my mentor. I must go away. Now! Come in. I came to tell you and pass this on to Shaodung. I will not pass on a single word for you! I know you came because you didn't want me to worry. Anything you want to tell Shaodung, go tell him yourself! He lives by... You both take me for a fool! I feel like I am not even a friend. Wait. Tell me. I want you and Shaodung to have a good life together. And someday, when you sing "The Road Home is Far". You will think of me. Wait. Take these. Please give this to Shaodung. Have this. Go. Go. Hurry! Didn't he come to see you? No. He wouldn't have. I am actually the one he wanted to escape from. I am jealous of his trust in you. He wouldn't give it to anyone else, not even me. Should I be jealous of his love for you? Or... your love for him? You bought a new pair of shoes. A red pair. It was the only pair in the store. And they were exactly my size. Do you like them? Let's get married. That's what your parents want, isn't it? The reason I came back is to marry you. We can't force things to fit. Like buying shoes. Ing'er... I am fond of you. But you love Lin Chung. I cannot love him. It's impossible for me to love him. And it's impossible for you to love me. You should leave. I would rather... We write to each other our entire lives... so that I may know every inch of your heart. Than have you hide portions of it from me, in trying to be a practical husband. I have never hidden anything from you. It is just that I have lost myself. You will find the answer you are looking for. I didn't find what I was looking for. I couldn't even find out what happened to Lin Chung. He had disappeared. I escaped back to America. And you? It was a whole other story here, not one that would interest you. The theatre was often used by the Japanese. For their style of entertainment, There were no more opera performances. And yet... I would still go there alone. As if the voices of the opera still hung in the air, and the stage still held unforgettable stories. Only that added to those stories was one of my own. Here we perform seven days a week and the schedule never changes. I live by myself in New York. I've completely lost touch with my family. There's only you. You are my lifeline to this world. Our connection through writing... makes me feel alive in this city facing its apocalypse. Is life... just full of sorrow? I still hope to find the answer. If not... I will isolate myself from this world, and spend the rest of my days here. I cannot answer your question. As for life's sorrow, it can be seen everywhere in this fallen city of darkness. Your parents were fortunate to have escaped south. Your home has been converted into a regimental headquarters. The other day when I cycled past it, and saw your window open, I almost called out to you. I have counted the hours... and my time is running out. In my flight from the government troops... The road home is far. The road home is far. Who will support my mother and wife? My fate is uncertain. I don't know if I will live or die. Ah! I am drenched with fear. And my body bums. Should I tell you about Lin Chung? I saw him. He was working as a coolie at the docks. The little money he earned, he spent on a dying man, Huang Zilei. I understand your feelings of despair. There are so many things in life that we can not comprehend. When the Japanese took over Tianjin the Huangs were hit hard. Their ownership in the docks was completely seized by the Japanese. No one from that opium-addicted family finished up well. Lin Chung wouldn't tell me why he stayed with Huang Zilei. He only said Huang was sick and couldn't be left alone. But I know that after he escaped, Huang used every possible means to track him down. It was when Lin Chung was most abject that he found him. Why didn't you look me up when you returned? Shaodung and I... we never did get... Hurry, Lee Chung! They are waiting! Lee Chung! Lee Chung! Did I tell you that he had his name changed to Lee Chong? And I couldn't help mentioning you... when he heard your name, his dull eyes lit up. Before we parted, I gave him your address in America. I don't know what I was thinking. Lin Chung couldn't even read Chinese, let alone English. In this world full of darkness, can we just ask for a little bit of hope? Just a ray of light? In 1941 Lin Chung boarded a ship. It was the year that the U.S. entered the war. Mid-journey, the ship was commandeered for freight, and it was diverted to Europe. After numerous reverses, when Lin Chung finally entered Manhattan harbor, and saw the Statue of Liberty, the war was over. Even then, he didn't make it to America. Only in 1949, when you came to New York, did my darkness start to lift. Would you like some fruit? Please sit. Thanks. It's been a long time since I last heard from you. I thought you must have married. I hope your parents are both well. And my parents? They are well. I visit them often. They treat me as part of the family., and I treat them as my own parents. Father eventually sold the Cloud Theatre. It became a nursery. And later, a warehouse. I know what you want to ask about. I never saw him. Lin Chung was arrested as an illegal immigrant, and was detained for immediate repatriation. Because it was right after the war, the U.S. Was flooded with refugees, procedures dealing with them were slow and chaotic, so Lin Chung languished in prison for two years. When I received notification from the Immigration Office, And saw the crystal cello, it was already the winter of 1947. Lin Chung had died in a hospital, one year before. I would never have thought... this was how we would be reunited. That night of the snow storm... when I turned my back, Lin Chung and I were separated... forever. For years, my recurring dream is... of that dark snowy road where I'm constantly running. Or I dream of myself at the hospital, where I get to see him one last time. Holding his hand. Telling him that I love him. You never told me... that you had given him the crystal cello. Yes. I never did tell you. I always loved him. I am grateful for my life. Although it has been such a long journey, you have always been there to listen to me. We can only share these thoughts with each other. So now... you understand my loneliness, don't you? This city is still here. I am still here. Someone walked by me... and asked about these three tombstones. I said, "One was my wife", "The other my lover"... I have placed you in between.
