You are about to meet a strange people... in a strange enemy country. You must keep clear of the Germans. You must not... fraternize. What does that mean? It means we shouldn't be friendly to them. This house is requisitioned for British use... by order of the Control Commission, Germany. You'll forgive us, Fraulein. It belongs to a family Lubert. He's an architect, sir. All change. He's meeting you here, is he? Susan. How was your trip? - Long. Quick, let's get home. Rachael. Hello, Lewis. - My God. Look at you. It's freezing. It is. Here. Let me take this. Welcome. Please come inside. Let me show you the house. Please, come inside. Let me show you the house. They're still finding bodies. There's over 25,000 dead still unaccounted for. How are you? Good. Fine. You? It's... It's been difficult. For you, too, I expect. For all of us. We dropped more bombs on Hamburg in one weekend... than fell on London in the whole of the war. That's different. Yeah. Thank you, Barker. Colonel Morgan. Welcome. - Herr Lubert. Please come inside. Let me show you the house. This is my wife, Mrs. Morgan. How do you do? After you, Mrs. Morgan. The finest room of the house. It's lovely, isn't it, darling? It's very modern. Yes, it is. That's a Steinway. An excellent instrument. - Yes. Do you play? Actually, I've rather let it slip. Well, it will be good to have it played again. What was up there before? A painting. It was damaged. I haven't replaced it yet. So the main staircase is this way. Our library. Herr Lubert's an architect. Was. Now I'm a metal press operator. Shall we? Die Elbe. It flows all the way to the... I'm sorry, I don't have the English. The Deutsche See? North Sea. - The North Sea, yes. It's all the same sea in the end. Indeed. It's cold. Can we go in? I hope you can be as happy here as we were. My daughter and I will stay out of your way... until we move to the camp. Thank you. You should have told me, that's all. What? Thinking of our honeymoon. My God. You look beautiful. You've still got this. Of course. You're smoking? Dr. Mayfield said that it would help with my nerves. And has it? The cabin, you remember? With its leaky roof. It rained for two weeks. - It did. And, my God, that cold. You burnt my books. Well, I had to. I had no choice. It was Agatha Christie. You might have waited until I found out who did it. The butler. - The butler always did it. Happy times. Good. The governor's here. Wilkins. - Sir. They were hit delivering food to the camp, sir. A grenade, I believe. Two of ours dead. Bloody looters are making it worse. Back! Get them back! Push them back! - Come on, move. Get them off! Christ. The breath on these people. Yes, well, that's what 900 calories a day does to you. Well, at least they're less trouble when they're hungry. Keith Burnham, Divisional Intelligence. So what have we got? Is that him? - That's the fella. Looks like Werwolves. 88s. Nazi bastards who won't accept we've won. Captain, can we have these two boys taken care of? Absolutely. Stop! Stop. A medic! Wilkins, get a medic. Yes, sir! Thought so. 88. Heil Hitler. Private. Get our men on the truck. And somebody bag this one up. Hello. You must be Freda. What were you reading? Freda. You can't be downstairs anymore. And take off this uniform. She never listens. I'm only her father. Freda, it's time to leave for school. Good morning, Frau Morgan. Would you like a cup of coffee? I'm sorry, I... I don't... Please, Frau Morgan... if I may. Sorry, emergency. Thank you, Heike. How are you. - Good, thank you. I see you have coffee. Yeah, I'd... I'd prefer tea. - They don't really do tea. I'll rustle some up from the NAAFI. Coffee it is, then. - No. Sleep well? Actually, I did. Good. That's really good. I'm looking forward to it being just us. What? Thank you, Heike. What if we let them stay on? The staff? Do we need them? - The Luberts. So you mean... Live with them? I mean, they'd be on the top floor. Rach, we'd hardly notice they're here. Is everyone doing it? - Here. It's not the same. No one else has a house like this. This isn't what we wanted, the... big house, the staff, the art on the walls. I know. I thought we were going to be together. - We are together. Alone. I... I'm not comfortable with it. With them. Not comfortable with them because they're Germans. It's chaos out there, Rachael. There's nowhere to put these people. There's nowhere to... Nothing to feed these people. There's... It does... It makes no sense to throw the Luberts out. You didn't tell me what I was walking into. This isn't how it was supposed to be. None of this is how it is supposed to be. And yet here we are. Thank you. I'm very grateful. - You're very welcome. Thank you. Do you manage? The kitchen table is not as heavy as the cupboard. Sorry, could... Could one of you help me, please? I want to move the plants. The plants? They're blocking the light. She makes herself at home. - Yes like a maggot in bacon. You don't like the chair? It's a Mies van der Rohe. The house of construction. It's meant to be one of the most comfortable chairs ever invented. Well, it isn't. It's ugly. He was of the Bauhaus school. Their philosophy was all about rejecting unnecessary adornment. Do you really need a philosophy to make something comfortable? Well, behind every object, there is a philosophy, isn't there? Herr Lubert, please don't creep about the house. I thought we agreed to keep to our own quarters. Our 'zones'. Yes, of course. I will try to remember. And if your daughter wants anything from her room... I'll get Heike to bring it up to her. This is all very new to her. - All the same. I will make words with her. - Have words. Sorry? - In English, you don't... 'make' words with someone. You should have these. As the lady of the house. Delicious, Heike. Danke schon, really. You are delicious. Danke, Frau Morgan. Look, she's doing it again. She's smirking. Because you said she was delicious. I was making an effort. - I know. I don't know how you do it. What? You go on like before, with all your little rituals. Get up, shave. Have a meal, go to work. Like nothing had changed. - Please, Rachael. I don't think it's healthy to talk this way. No? - No. No? How am I expected to talk? You might like to set an example. When did you get to be so self-righteous? Did you see him? Did you see him? Did you see him? Did you see him? Did you see him? - Leave her alone. Come on. Let's have that tea. I don't know when he got to be so sanctimonious. You stifle under the weight of all that decency. Lawrence of Hamburg, Keith calls him. The one who went queer for the natives. He actually seems to like Lubert. Lew let them stay on. Is that wise? There may not be an outward show of hatred, but it's there below the surface. Be careful, that's all. They're not like us. Good afternoon. Freda! Go to your room. Immediately! It's fine. Please forgive her, Mrs. Morgan. She should have asked permission. It's all right. - It's not. She plays well. - She plays very badly. She never practices. Claudia despaired of her. Claudia? Her mother. My wife. Is she somewhere in the house too? She died in the firestorm. I'm so sorry. If Freda wants to play, I don't see why not. In the afternoons, for half an hour or so, I... I thought we agreed to keep to our 'zones'. I don't want you to go downstairs anymore. Understood? It's their house now. Just like that. Would you rather stay in a camp? Mum was right. You are a coward. Don't stay up too long. You have school tomorrow. Classes are stupid! - You're talking nonsense! I no longer want to go to school. Bus-stop 9, exit please. Freda, where are you going? You'll be paid in food vouchers for your work, given a meal... - Freda. ...and brought back home before dark. Are you sixteen? Sixteen? Yes? Bodies! Come and help me! Bodies here! All right, stand back. Get them away from it, Tom, will you? Not a bad way to go... One last screw before lights out. Come. - Back to work, you lot. Don't listen, those are idiots. - Bag up these bones. We didn't work that much. Forgive me for intruding. It's freezing upstairs. I cut some firewood earlier. Do you mind if I... - No, not at all. No need to ask permission. We're going out this evening, but can I get you a drink? No, thank you. Well then... good night. Good night. Still got it. - Keith won't be long. We're so glad you could come. - Thank you. Well, it's good to finally meet you... and a relief to be out of the house. What a house, though. It's almost worth living with a German. It's so funny. You've got one, too. A missing painting. We have one just like it. Everyone does. It's where they would have hung him. Who? The FÃ¼hrer. 'The stain that can't be removed'. They're usually clever enough to cover them up. Sorry to keep you. Apologies. Thank you. Based on their answers, we assign them a category from black to white. They're clean... they get their Persilschein... their laundry ticket. It's the certificate allowing them to return to a normal life. Does Lubert have his Persilschein? Does it matter? Yes. I think I have the right to know if I'm living with a Nazi. Yes, I think it does matter. I don't think you can judge a person... by his answers to a questionnaire. No? How do you judge him? You look him in the eye. Lubert was never in uniform. - That's not the point. Well, there was no blood on his hands. There's blood on all their hands. Honestly, Lew, I sometimes wonder whose side you're on. Even after everything that they've done... - The war is over. We won. That's the end of it. Let's have dessert in the drawing room. - Well, does he or not? Not yet. It's a formality. Shall we? Morning, sir. Papers, ma'am. Papers. There you are. Papers, sir. Lewis from Rachael with love - 1941 So you were building houses for Nazi officials. After 1933, we built what we were told to build. Did the bombing affect the health of you and your family? It's a simple question. It affected the health of my wife. She was one of the 40.000 killed... when British bombers razed this city to the ground. July 27th, 1943. Well, let's talk about your wife. The money was hers? Her family was wealthy, yes. They owned a number of shipping yards. Shipping yards used to transfer Nazi weapons? Among many other things. You have to understand that my wife and I... had nothing to do with her family business. It was her father and brother... - Yet you claim... to never have joined the Nazi Party? I was against everything the Nazis stood for. That wasn't my question. No. I was never a party member. Did you know about the camps? No. So you've never seen these? Here. Have a look. One last question. During the war, did you ever hope for a German victory? You answered: I wanted it to end. I wanted to go back to how it was. What, you miss the past? Is that it? I miss my wife. All right. You'll hear from us in due course. Herr Lubert? Herr Lubert? Could you come in here, please? Could you explain this? It's a Von Guerard. I'm not asking what it is. I'm asking what it's doing here. You objected to the stain, so I covered it. What's the matter, don't you like it? That's not the point. What's it covering? - Does it offend you? He was German, maybe that offends you. It was a picture of him, wasn't it? Of him? - Your FÃ¼hrer. It's simple for you. The war ends. You go home the winner. Your conscience is clear. Is your conscience not clear? I thought you would like the painting. I apologize if I was mistaken. Would you object to a landscape? A nice hunting scene perhaps? I object to your tone. - Then throw us out! Herr Lubert. - Throw us out. You hate us. It's what you want. Throw us out. - Nobody said anything about... We can leave you alone to fight with your husband, when he bothers to be here. I think you've said enough. - Then throw us out. Here. I'll give you a reason. I think you should go. Be careful. Come on. Get me some water, I need a wash. Nice. Where did you get it? From an Englishman who stole my house. You see this? Do you know what this is? The dust of our city. The ashes what's left of our people. The remainings of young German girls like you. What is this? The eight character. H Heil Hitler. What do you think? It's stunning. - Idiot. Me? - I meant the table. Burnham at the head or next to Susan? Let's just keep him away from the alcohol. Just don't argue with him. Be English. Talk about the weather. What are you doing? I was just admiring your dress. Thinking how lucky I am. Do you like it? You ought to, it took me long enough. I'm imagining... what you look like out of it. When do our guests arrive? Not for an hour. Not for an hour. You are... Phone Mr Morgan, please. Go upstairs. Lock the door. What is it? - There's a protest at headquarters. I'm sorry, my love, but... Well, you'll have to entertain the guests until I get back. Go on, then. Go and save Germany. Don't be like that. I'll be back as soon as I can. Wish me luck. Feed us! Feed us! Feed us! Captain. They've barricaded the street, sir. They're not letting anybody in or out. I want this street closed off. Captain, tell the men there is to be no firing. Break through! We need more men! Get back! Back! Sir. Sir, where are you going? Get back! No firing. No firing! It's outrageous, a clergyman? - A chance to rebuild. What choice did we have? Thank you, Heike. We've done them a favor. Now it's time to leave. We're talking about war. Nobody really wins, do they? There's nothing left for us here. French got the wine. Yanks got the view. What? We got the ruins. And what does Herr Lubert think? I don't know. You'd have to ask him. Well, I must say, this is good hock. Thank Herr Lubert. My God, Mr Lubert, what happened? I'll get a doctor. - No, I'm okay Greta. Bravo! I'm going to bed. Herr Lubert! Come and join us. My husband wants your opinion on something. I'm not feeling my best. But thank you all the same. Good night. I'd ask you not to hit the piano like that. It belonged to my wife. Lubert. Lubert, Lubert... Steady on. All right, all right. Sorry about the glass, old boy. - Stefan! Well done. I'm so sorry. What for? I'm the one who should apologize. Good night. Good night. That's not necessary. You've got grit in it. This is going to hurt. You've been avoiding me. Have I? I don't think so. I was going to apologize. For what? Don't. I was going to... but I won't. Rachael. Stop. Everything all right? What happened to you? I was caught up in a protest. You were at the protest? Not by choice. Then you know what happened. Bloody people tried to kill me. Dammit, what is the matter with this country? You don't realize we're here to help? I should go. Good night. - Good night. I'm sorry. How was the party? Fine. I'm tired. I'm gonna go up. All right. I'll be up in a bit. Freda? Listen, do you have something of mine? Yes? My wife gave it to me. There are photographs in there, and I would like it back. Perhaps you've seen it? Freda, I... Morning. - Morning, sir. Sir. - Thank you. Sir. There's been an attack. Bomb, sir. In the Russian zone. Oh, Christ. It's only for a few days. I'll be back in time for Christmas. Where are you going? I could come with you. I'm sorry, no. 'This is the army, Mrs. Jones.' Yes. I'll make it up to you, I promise. I suppose I should be used to it. Six days. Sorry? I asked. I checked. They'd have given you six days leave... after the funeral... and you didn't take it. Why didn't you take it? I asked myself that and I had a lot of time to think about it. Please. - And then I thought, why... Maybe he just doesn't... Rach. - feel it like I do. You wasn't there. - No. There was a war on. I had a job to do. What did I have? Nothing. What is it you want from me? Lewis... I want him back. I can't do that for you. Lewis. Lewis. Please. I'm asking you. I'm begging you. Please don't go. I'm going out. Sir. - Barker. Barker did you make a phone call? The Russians know where coming, sir. Did you check the weather? - The roads are free, sir. Moonlight Claude Debussy Michael could never manage that bit, either. Michael. My son. He died in the war. A bomb hit our house on July the 2nd, 1942... and killed him. He was eleven. He'd be about your age right now. He used to come home from school. He'd have... He'd have ink all over his hands. I'd have to spend hours... He'd get it all over the keys. And I don't... I don't think I can... I don't know if I can... don't... think I can cope. Because... I should have stopped him. I should have... I was his mother. I was his mother. I can't... I can't... I couldn't... I can't bear it. - Freda. I can't bear I can't... I can't bear it. It's all right. I can't. Enter. Mrs. Morgan. I wondered if you'd like to join me for breakfast. Both of you. We would like that very much. I'm... I have somebody coming over tomorrow to do my hair... if Freda would like to join me. Freedie? Thank you, Mrs. Morgan. Why? What's wrong with my hair? Make sure to be back before dark. - Of course. Come in. Herr Lubert. Frau Morgan. Will you need me this afternoon? No, thank you, Greta. That will be all. These were your men. Do you have the man responsible? I'd like to see him. Siegfried Leitman, former SS SturmbannfÃ¼hrer. Do you speak English? Yes, I do. - Good. This boy. You know him? No. - Come on. Come on. You wear the same mark. There are many of us with that mark. Then give me their names. Why would I do that? Colonel, this man still has his bootlaces on. An oversight. He might have hanged himself. But you didn't, did you? Because you're a coward. You send children to do your killing. Yes. They make the best killers. They don't question it. And you don't have the stomach for handling them. That's where you're wrong. See, I killed younger than this. When the war was on, before the bureaucrats took over, I killed every German I got my hands on. Yes. - Because I wanted it to end. You are murderers too. You think we have forgotten? You are like a child who covers his eyes... and thinks the world goes away. But we won't forget. We will cut your men's throats in the streets. We will burn your women in their homes. We will bomb your children while they are sleeping in their beds. Colonel Morgan. You want it? - Nein! Now... give me their names. I'm so sorry. No. We're nearly there. It's still freezing. I actually can't feel my toes. That's not good. Let me check. What are you doing? I'm just checking. - Stop it. Stop it. - Yep, still here. So are your feet. Stop it. - Ankles, yep. Calves. And your thighs. Before the war, I bought some land in the Alps. Near Oberstdorf. It's not much now, just a cabin. A bit like this one. - Warmer, I hope. I'm going to build a house. Something very modern. Just one floor... set into the hillside... with steel beams and a glass wall facing the beautiful pine trees. You can ski to the front door. What do you think? Could you live in it? I don't know how to ski. You're smiling. I smile all the time. - Hardly ever. Not since you came here. I like you like this. I never thought that I could be happy like this again. Then come with us. You don't have your papers. How will you travel? They will clear me. It's just a matter of time. This is Stunde Null. The Zero Hour. Everything can start again. You like my haircut? It was better before. A real Hitler girl. Tell me about the Englishman who took your house. I let him get to me. Leitman. I shouldn't have. He murdered children, sir. If it was me, I would have loaded the gun. You would've loaded the gun? Yeah. No, you wouldn't have. Yeah. No, I wouldn't. Dad always said I lack the spine to be a soldier. Yes. Then I think your dad probably gave you a compliment. It's not the war that makes men of us. I've done things I'm certainly not proud of. I often wonder, my wife... if she knew... how she'd feel about me. Let's get out of this bloody cold and get home. Rachael. Sorry I'm late. So, what is this about? I need a favor. It's taking a long time to clear Lubert. What's your secret? What? - Something's changed. Oh, it's my hair. I had it done. No. Something else. It's Christmas. I've always liked Christmas. Really? I can't stand it. Not Christmas without children. Is the teddy bear for the girl? Yes. - And... the cigars? For my husband. - When he gets back? Yes. For when he gets back. Well, I suppose I could ask Keith what's taking so long to clear him. If you're going to spy on a girl, the least you could do... is pay her a compliment. Hello, Rachael. I'm home. Lewis. Is Lubert around? I think he's in the garden. Why? - He should join us. I'm going to clean up. I have some news. What are we celebrating? I've been offered a new post. Your trip was successful? Successful? Well... Let us see, shall we? Herr Morgan? Shall I prepare supper? - That won't be necessary, Greta. We're going out to a regimental dinner tonight. But you can please join us for a glass of champagne. Come on. Come in and join us. A second Christmas. Shall we say a Russian one. A post? Where? The War Office. London. We're going home. So? I've been cleared. I knew it. Congratulations. Burnham must have pulled some strings. That's really wonderful. - Yes, it is. I... I don't understand. You haven't finished your work here. Well, I put in a request. I didn't want to tell you. I didn't want you to get your hopes up. But we're going home. So, from both of us, I'd like to say thank you... and... to new beginnings. Bertie? Bertie? I do it for the eternal glory of Germany Heil Hitler. Bertie. Right. Sorry. This dress, it isn't right. What are you doing? He's downstairs. Just tell him. Tell him you're leaving with me... tonight. I can't. - Then I will. No, it has to come from me. It's the same dress. - What? Yes. My love. Sir. Rachael! Lew. - Yes? We need to talk. Colonel. Just a minute. General. - How are you? Good, good. How are you? You know you'll be wasted in Whitehall. Well, you're leaving this city in better shape than you found it. Cheers. Glad to be of service. Sir. Rachael. Oh, Rachael. Is it true? What? - You're really leaving? Won't you miss it? - What will she miss? The staff? - The people. I must say, I'm surprised at you, Morgan. For what? I thought you'd prefer to handle the matter yourself. I have no idea what you're talking about. Don't play innocent. If you're so bloody convinced Lubert's clean, don't send your wife to press his case for you. Do you really want to go back to London rationing? I'm sure Lewis would forgive you if you did choose to stay. Susan. Ladies. Excuse me. Would you mind if I... borrowed my wife? Please. Tell me I'm wrong... what I'm thinking. Tell me I'm losing my mind. Lewis... I'm so sorry. How long? No, not here. I was gone a few days. How long have you been fucking him? Don't do this. - I want to know. Why? What difference does it make? - I want to know the moment... our marriage was over. It's been over for years, ever since Michael died. Don't you dare bring him into this. Everything changed when he died. Why can't you admit it? You left me. It's my fault. - No, no. It's mine. Why can't you just say it? Say it. You blame me for letting him die. Take me home. Please, can you take me home? Just get in. Get in the car. Get in the car. Give me the keys. Give me the keys. - Here they are, sir. Rachael, get down. Rachael, hold on. No, dear God. - Rachael, are you hurt? Are you hurt? - Lewis. I'm going after him. Lewis. - Two shots. Stay in the car. - Can you just... I will fire! Stop! Stop! Bertie? Stop or I will fire! I will shoot! You have nowhere to go! Stop! Do it! Shoot! Come on, shoot now! Albert! Freda, no. It's too late. Albert! Help me! Help me! Freda! Albert! Come on. Just stay with me. Stay with me. Take him. Papa! I should never have brought you here. Can't blame you... for wanting to start again. Which boy? Freda, answer me! I would always defend you. Why do you do that? Listen... you are my daughter. I know I didn't always show it. But you're the most important in my life. I miss mum. Me too. But we have each other. We'll always have each other. Lewis? Are you all right? How is she? She's sleeping. He knows. Good. We should leave in the morning. Just go. How did it happen? Was he in pain? He was caught in the blast. It was instant. Yeah. You know, I never wanted to leave you. I had to. You know, I see his face... every time I look at you. When you laugh, I... hear his voice. I... When... Every time I touch you, I... I smell him on your skin. You're the best part of me, Rachael. You always will be. Rachael? Ready? Rachael? You... no, no, no, no, no. You're coming with me. I need you. We needed each other. But this is what you wanted. Start again. I do. I do. Forgive me. Rachael. Papa! Papa!
