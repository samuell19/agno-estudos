Oh, Navy! (Gateway to Glory) See how the enemy hordes gather Can they really scare us? Spring of 1933 Thunder cry of an army soldier chanting to the world in the name of just militarism. Heaven is angry, the big waves at sea Drown the enemies of our country. Numerous hordes of Mongols lost among the algae at the bottom. In this unit, there can be no one lagging behind! You all showed yourself well. Military training has made you great fighters. However, there is still someone among you who is against military service! Look at this! "We must contrast training at school with military training" Before we left, I found this poster on the facade of the military records building. Who wrote this? Does anyone want to confess? Unless someone admits it, everyone will be punished! Do not just look at each other. Answer! I know that this is definitely one of you! Let the culprit come forward. It's you? Yes, sir! They say you're going take an exam for the Army military academy. Why would you be against military training? It can't be you. This is someone else. Confess! It's me. Cadet Hirata! Hirata ... is it really you? Yes, sir! You are the squad commander! What would possess you to write this? Well, answer! You're a smart guy. Would you really do such a stupid thing? Are you really ... I want to go to school! To study? What nonsense! Don't you understand the times we live in now? Students just thoughtlessly memorize books! In today's Japan, the government and the people must rally! It is necessary to create a powerful national defense force! You have a duty as warriors of the Emperor! Give all your strength to the service of the Empire! Hirata, forget these sentimental dreams regarding study. If you would go study at another school ... ... Then how do you occupy here main position in the squad? I want to resign in order to go to high school. And still you argue! Do you really want to leave just to go to school? Yeah. For a smart guy like you, being unable to study must be really scary. In truth, I've always wanted to go to high school. - When you're older? - Yes. You can't avoid or unlearn military training no matter what. And we, being from poor families, must go into the service as soon as we're taught to write. Do you hate the service? No, not that. After graduating from military school it will be difficult for me to find a job that is not related to the military. But a serviceman will always be honored! Hirata. Let's take our school exams together. When I think about it, it's really hard to make a decision. I have to go. My mom is waiting for me. See you later. I'm here! Welcome back. With all this Army training, I forgot about the time. Mom, let me help you and you rest. No, no. You have collected a lot. Honda is still planning to take the exams for the military academy. You still want to do the same thing? I want you to go to high school... but we don’t have enough money yet to send you there. Maybe you can find a rural government position to make money. In the meantime... Mama! Mom, what is it? It's nothing. Just sometimes my heart aches. Mom ... are you sick? Not to worry. Poor people may not have much but they do have good health. Stop put me on the ground! You're really heavy, mama! You are still a mischievous child! Do not be ashamed of this. Don't you have a study session with the landowner's daughter later? Yeah but not until this evening. First I'll have a bite to eat. Is this correct? Then tell me how to make it correct. Well, I can’t do everything for you. Try it yourself! "The Second Tale of Poverty" by Hajime Kawakami, Japanese Communisty Party What difficult questions! I don’t think that you can answer them. This is a test from a military school. Are you kidding me? Is there any tea left? Give me your notebook. Wasn't Honda was going to go to the Army academy? Where will you go? Well... Where to? I don't know. Nobu! Wait, Nobu! Are you really going to Tokyo? I have to go there to find a job for my younger brother and sick father. But we are not strangers. Why didn’t you even discuss is this with my family? We would not leave you in need. Didn't our parents give consent to our engagement? But!... I do not want you talking to them about my problems. It's been two years since the engagement. And you still shy away from my relatives? If money is so necessary I can earn some by working rickshaws. Where exactly are you going to earn money? You don’t even know yourself?! Nobu! Nobu! Hey! Hirata! What? At last! Really? Congratulations! And not just me. Yours came too! Here. Auntie,... Higata made a high score! I received a notification at the administration office. So he will become a student of the naval academy? Yes! Show, show. Indeed! And you too? Yes, indeed. And the chiefs of the village administrative office was also very happy that We now have two students at the naval academy. What a good fellow you are! I still need to talk with my mother. Goodbye! Hey, Honda! Mama... I am... I didn’t tell you that ... Why didn't you tell me you took the military academy exam? It's okay. I'm very happy for you. Listen, Ichiro. I had thought to sell half our farm to afford high school, but... ...now that this has arrived. Although I'm proud that you are now a military academy student, You have to study hard. What about the household? Somehow I can handle it myself, so don’t worry about it. Mama In fact, I want to go to high school... What? It’s time to eat. I hope you live a long life, so you still have time to farm. I know how difficult it is for you to work our land after father's death. Difficult? Not at all. April 1934 I hereby proclaim... these 187 people ... students of the naval academy! The school you have entered was established in Tokyo in 1869 ... but moved to the island of Etajima in 1888. I hope too, that from today, you, future sailors of the Navy, will study in good faith, as befits the students of the Etajima Academy! Going further in their training, you must form a strong, united Navy! A great Navy worthy of being called Imperial! Show that you are ready to be called the best of the best, able to push back any enemy at any time, seeking in any fight only to achieve victory. You must develop in yourself an indestructible fortitude, and become an exemplary sailor of the Imperial Navy! Attention! Salute! At ease! Now pay attention. I am Captain Okano. The commander of your unit.. And also, your supervisor and instructor. As well as... your guardian for the duration of your training. Therefore, I will relate to each of you as a father to his son. A kinship between students and supervisors - one of the great traditions of our Academy. To treat students as our children, and, as instructors, to act as your parents. But bring up you with rigid discipline! So get ready! I am... a fourth year student Cadet Officer Moricita! You junior students, should look to the older students as older brothers! So now we need to hear your names. Each of you introduce yourself! Say where you come from, where did you study, and what is your name. In the order in which you stand. Let's start with you. Introduce yourself! Born in Fukuoka, graduated from Totoku High School... I cannot hear you! Do not whisper! What? Can't you get any louder? Yes sir! Born in Fukuoka, graduated from Totoku High School... Ekishi Tamara! Good! Next! Graduate Tokyo school, Sinatro Katayama! Excellent! Your fighting spirit is felt! Next! High school graduate, Iwate Prefecture, Ichiro Hirata. I did not hear you! Why so quiet? Didn't you hear how you are supposed to do it? You mumble so! Stand at attention! And don't look around at each other! In our school... you must listen to what the fourth year students say! Again! High school graduate Iwate Prefecture, Hirata Ichiro !!! Faster! Why are you slowing down? Let's move! Stop! You forgot how to go up the stairs? Start over! Yes! Good! Hirata. You took exams for admission to high school? Why do you say that? I saw a list of enrolled students. Your name is written there. Is that true? Yes, you can see the list in the reading room. I must be dreaming... This, most likely, you are. Thanks! Hey, Hirata! What are you doing? Found it! Captain. Due to the fact that I passed the exams to high school and was accepted, I want to resign from the military academy. You're leaving? For high school? Yes, sir! It's probably too late for that now. I think it will be permitted if I explain the situation. I am ready right now to turn in my military uniform. May I? It is a pity, but it will not happen. But I'm ready. Cadet Hirata! You are already an honorary serviceman in the Imperial Navy. You can't leave here at will. But this is also an educational institution. If you volunteer here and pass the exams, voluntary withdrawal should be permitted. That's what you think? What oath did you make upon entering this school? To fully follow military discipline ... responsibly bear your military duties, obey orders. Did you not say those words? Yes, sir. However... I believe that I will bring more benefits to our country after graduation from high school. I want to become a politician to solve social problems in our homeland. So, I filed out an application to enter high school. Hirata. You didn’t just enter the Naval Academy. Upon becoming a student of this institution, you entered into service of His Imperial Majesty! The serviceman must obey orders even to the detriment of one’s own interests. Remember it well! But... Enough! Cadet Hirata has arrived! The captain told me what happened today. How can you be so irresponsible in regard to service in the Navy? You are a sailor in the Imperial Navy now! You will be here for four more years. I will teach you what it means to be a student of the Etajima Naval Academy. I'll teach you a good lesson! Feet shoulder width apart! Grit your teeth! Get up! Enough? Do you understand now? You are too slow! Get a move on! March around! All come together! March around! Form a line! March! He's doing pretty well. Yes. No longer trying to argue. Maybe you need to be even stricter? No, that's enough. Otherwise, his spirit will be broken. I think he can become a promising officer. Is there anything that can rob you of your loyalty? Is anything able to force you to do a shameful thing? Can someone rob you of fighting spirit? February 26, 1936 "Alert from the military ministries" "Army cadets assassinate cabinet members" "Briefly take over the Imperial Palace" "Martial law introduced in the capital" These rebels are traitors to the motherland! You are talking about this again. Stop it! You don’t understand that those Army cadets, like you, were fighting against corrupt officials. I went to college in spite of the poverty in which we lived. In our countryside, the women have to work like cattle. They sell everything they have. Only corrupt government officials get rich! Do you think this should continue? I am a naval cadet. I cannot approve these kinds actions by the Army. What do you think we should do? Can you suggest something? You think everything will be just fine with the oligarchs in charge of Japan? We do as we are ordered! You expect too much. Hirata, didn't the Captain talk to you? A soldier must always act like a soldier. Ponder this question again. July 1937 The fires of war spread all over mainland China. You have to study enemy aircraft well, in order to seize supremacy in the air. Then it will be possible for your squadron to strike the decisive blow. The trump card that we must apply is to first have air supremacy before the Army can capture the land. So our main naval forces must be built around the aircraft carrier. I have a question! Ask. What should we do if our aircraft carrier is attacked by the enemy? The aircraft from the carrier and the men manning its guns can defend itself against all attacks. I believe air supremacy inevitably leads to domination of the sea. Because it creates a strong base for advancement on the ground. I understand you! I have a question! Ask. Our Army land forces now in China, our Navy's ships are located along the entire coast of the mainland, and our bombers hold air supremacy. Correct. And so? A rebellion has erupted in China and our troops are slowly being whittled down in un-ending battles. Unless there is a change in our policies toward China, nothing can be done to improve the lives of our own people here. Right. However, taking into account various factors, the High Command can withdraw troops only after the main battles are won. Hirata. In the future, you will all have to analyze the situation and think ahead, so as not to make these kinds of mistakes. But for now you, all of you, as naval school cadets must train to be an obediant Imperial Navy sailor. You must remember this. Yes, sir! Hey, Hirata! What? The Captain is calling you. The Captain? Cadet Hirata reporting. Prepare to return home. This is a telegram for you. Read it. "Mother in critical condition. Come back soon." So get moving. You still have time for the evening train. What? I do not want to go back. What? You are so indifferent to the grave condition of your mother? Isn't your mother your only parent? My parent is the unit commander! And you don't have a son's feeling for his mother? My mother single-handedly raised me in extreme poverty. I want to go to her... but I'm afraid to become dependent on family relations. I hesitate because I have firmly decided to become a worthy sailor. Therefore I must behave not like someone’s son, but like a sailor! And forget about any feelings as a son. You have changed. Very well. I understand. Hirata, go to the park and pray for your mother’s health. The Emperor’s Honorary Award to the top 65th class student is awarded to... Ichiro Hirata! Yes! Cadet Hirata! Congratulations. Thank you. You've done very well. Who would have thought that the boy who was so eager to attend high school would achieve such success here. All thanks to my instructor! I was only pushing you. And what's more, I believed in you from the very beginning. Hirata, you have to be careful. regarding your excessive passion for politics especially domestic politics. One has to be careful with such topics abroad. Abroad? Our Navy now roams the Pacific Ocean. Japanese policies toward Anglo-American and China should be restrained. So that in the future it is possible to have governmental negotiations. And Japan will lead negotiations with America? The Japanese military today is superior to America's but we lag far behind in industrial capacity. We must reach an agreement with America. If not, Japan will need... the blood of you young sailors. In fact, Hirata, I myself am leaving the Naval Academy. I have orders to go to London. Officially, I'm going there as embassy military attache. But in fact, I'm going there to find out more about the Royal Air Force in England. What? Now is not the time when ordinary soldiers and sailors should interfere in politics. We must follow orders. Clear? Yes, sir! Raise oars! Grandma was very diligent. She said she would never die until she saw you again. And then... just before her death she said... "My boy is now serving in the Navy, so do not call him." Accept my thanks for caring for her. How happy your mother would be to know that her son became an officer ... Why didn’t you come back sooner? Honda! Hirata! Honda! You look healthy! Something strange happened to her... You met her in Tokyo? No. I recently received a letter from her but there was no return address. Her parents also don’t know where she is now. It's as if she is deliberately hiding. How odd. Hirata, by the way. Sorry about your mother. I came to visit her grave. She worked all her life, tirelessly. She sweated her whole life. Poor peasants die from hard work. While young men go to the war in China and die on the battlefield. And their sisters have to become servants to make a living and not starve to death. Hirata. You think we can calmly wage war when things are so bad in our country? I'm in the Third Infantry Regiment. The one that took part in the rebellion on February 26. Our commanding officer was executed as a state criminal. But I support him! I understand your feelings. But now is not the time to be starting riots in our country. Why do we have military regulations if we don't adhere to them? How can you go to fight in some far off place while in your home country there are so many problems? This Chinese misadventure goes on and on! Honda, China is not Japan’s only adversary. The main opposing naval forces we face are British and especially American forces. Now it’s important to pay attention to the international position ... and be fully prepared for a changing situation. With this I agree.. I've heard a lot about the power of the Anglo-American fleets. Hirata! You are much more experienced than me. I will go to the naval air arm. Soon they will become one of the most important forces. You should apply! May 1939 - The conclusion of the Italian-German military union July 1939 - The USA ends trade agreements with Japan September 1939 - Germany invades Poland The British and French declare war on Germany. June 1940 - France surrenders to Germany Navy Headquarters Who are you? Lieutenant Hirata. Reporting on joining the air squadron. Finally. So you are Hirata? I am Captain Maikawa. You've come to see chief Yuji? No, I've come here on orders. So you do not know him? I understand you are being put into to a special unit. Araki. This is Lieutenant Hirata. I am Araki. I have been waiting for you? I still remember how the Captain told me about reprimanding you when you were in your first year. Yes! Since you know him, how is he? Morishita is dead. In March of this year. His airplane crashed. Really... Entering! Permission to enter? Wait, wait there. Well, let's continue. How will a treaty with Germany and Italy help us establish a new order in Asia? You, as the head of our Navy ministry, must explain why we need this Tri-Partite Pact? I want a clear answer. I understood your question. Because Americans believe that Hitler is their main enemy, In joining forces with him, we only threaten Japanese-American relations. And at the same time, if Germany loses to America, Japan will be able to calmly continue our own course of action. Nonsense! How is it possible in such a national emergency to act so rashly? Do you still call yourself a military man? I am a military man. And during the war, I must lead my men to victory. But Japan should not wage war with America. Instead of winning you want to be defeated? What will you do yourself? Tell me. I am trying to stop it! You must abandon this tactic! The ultimate goal of our great Empire is unquestionably victory. That should be your task! I believe that if you will not change this decision, you must die. From the first day I became a military man, I knew how to die. That’s all I can tell you. You can come back later. Well, today we leave. But we will come in another day to discuss this. Lieutenant Hirata reporting. Indeed ... you are very determined. You remember Captain Okano, who went on a trip to London? Yes, sir. He was my unit commander at the Academy. He recommended bringing you here because of your outstanding abilities. Minister. I do not meet the requirements. I'd rather be on the front lines! I understand. But lately, there is much arbitrariness in the Japanese military. The Navy needs men like you. Since you're so determined, we will help you to enter the air service. Yes, sir. Due to the oil embargo, we are running out of fuel for our aircraft. Due to the termination of trade relations between the USA and Japan, the amount of oil now in Japan may not be enough to last for one year. Why? Because America has stopped oil supplies. So it's true? Why? Our continued presence in China has caused the United States and her allies to end all oil shipments to Japan. Now, we can only rely on oil reserves we have on hand. Now every drop of fuel is as precious as one drop of blood. The question is how we can we obtain new oil supplies from the south before we run out. Although I think America can stop that too. What does the Minister say? I did not quite understand him. He definitely understands that now is not the time to start a war with America. But in any case, he very much trusts admiral Yamamoto. But the USA and England are already a real threat. The forces on the front lines have long been ready to attack. The decision has been made. We must now act. This is the position of the Army forces. They can launch an offensive on land but the Navy cannot support them to due to lack of money and resources. What? Lieutenant Hirata. The Minister will leave at 5 o'clock. You are to go with him. Do you have a suit? Yes. Where are we going? Shimbashi district in Tokyo. Welcome! Are you bored? I beg your pardon. Sorry, I'll warm it up now. No, pour. Good. Is there always such fun here? Yes. Do you think it is too noisy? Admiral Yamamoto has arrived from Tokyo. Admiral Yamamoto? And Prime Minister Yonai. Yonai, Miyamoto, Iguchi ... People all opposed to the Tri-Partite Pact. A lot of arguing going on and it keeps getting louder. They're in such a situation! And another thing. There are some suspicious-looking people in the room who are also quite tipsy. So be careful. Already drunk? Any sake left? The geishas will bring more. Minister. I want to talk to you. About what? Is the Navy able to counter America? America? Who said that we will fight America? You think war can be avoided? We have strong allies now. Victory is guaranteed. The situation cannot be resolved peacefully. Please come in. There you are. So you're the one that Iguchi told me about? Yes, sir! Lieutenant Hirata! You want to join the aviation service? How many hours have you flown already? A thousand and twenty hours. Really. You seem very capable. A hard worker. Yes! Iguchi, we need such strong, young men. Lieutenant Hirata. What is harder for you to conquer: a girl’s heart or the enemy? In these times, Admiral Yamamoto carries the heaviest burden for our country. Got it, Hirata? Pardon. Hirata! Honda! Here is the meeting! And you ... what are you doing here? I was going to ask you the same thing. I am a guard. A guard? I accompaned an important person. Hey! What is it? Did someone just come in here who shouldn't have? No. And who are you? I am Lieutenant Hirata. I came here with Minister Iguchi. Sorry to bother you! What's going on? We grabbed a war criminal but he's gotten away from us. There are definitely no such person in this place! Where are you going? Don’t worry. Let's get more drunk! Ok, then let's go and get drunk! But somewhere there are none of our commanders and officers. In our old haunt! You said it! Goodbye! Thank you very much, thank you very much ... Be careful! Come on, let's go there! Please wait. Wait! Hey, wait! Where are you, Honda?! Is he your friend? He probably got drunk ... I will calm him down. Oh, please. Nobu ... Let go! So, you are in this place? Do you know how long I've been looking for you? All the letters with no return address. You have been working here all this time! I did not know what else to do! Sorry. Why haven't you killed yourself? Instead of entertaining strange men every night, go hang yourself! Hey, Honda! Let go. Stop this, Honda! Let go! Let go, Hirata! Nobu ... Nobu! Honda, let's go. No need to worry about her any more. Why? It’s not her fault. Wandering around without shelter. She found work here. Hirata, do you think it's possible to get enough money to buy her back? You would... I want to free her from this place. She should not stoop this low. Would that be right? You think she won’t be sorry if she comes back? You want me to leave Nobu here? Midori! Midori! Someone help! Help! Nobu ... she's dead! Dead? Yes, she jumped from the third floor. You killed her! It's your fault! During this period, I shall write you about all kinds of difficulties. I am now in Heilongjiang, on the border with Manchuria, defending the national interests of our country. Mrs. Tashiko. Long time no see. Yes. Anything going on? I was busy in Tokyo, so I didn’t have time to meet you. That's how it is. Are you going to work now? Yes. Let's walk together. Did you want to tell me something? At home, there's talk about getting married. Father constantly talks about it, but I don’t know what to do. We arranged a meeting with one man but I don’t know if I can ever like him. Wastrel. Wastrel? What do you mean? Some strive for comfort but remain unhappy. But you are quite happy. News! News! News! News! Tri-Partite Pact signed between Japan, Germany and Italy. June 1941 - Germany invades the USSR December 8th "Japan declares war on the United States" After the capture of southeast Asia in the second half of the year, by the Japanese Empire. On June 5, 1942 an invasion was launched against Midway island. But during this operation, the Japanese Navy suffered a major defeat at the hands of the US Navy. As a result, four large aircraft carriers were lost along with all their planes and many pilots. The first defeat ever for the Japanese Navy. Japan was now in a dangerous position. January 1943 - Airbase on the island of Rabaul That's pretty good! No, no, go ahead. Captain, do you like to draw? No, I do not know how. Yamashita, I didn’t know that you could draw like that. In fact, I learned drawing at school. Why did you join the Navy? It's just... that these aren't the times for becoming an artist. I abandoned the idea of becoming an artist. But lately I've been wanting to draw again. The god of death has gone to the Yasukuni shrine. Let's see. Ah, snow. Beautiful... I often dream of myself in snow. Who is this? My mother. She is so young. She is already very old. I drew this from childhood memories. Air raid! Air raid! Scramble all aircraft! What's wrong? It won't start. Everyone, get out. Enemies straight ahead! Right! Captain! Dammit! Five dead, 12 wounded. 18 aircraft damaged. 13 planes remain. We need replacement aircraft. Of course, we need to replenish a lot of military equipment. What do you think? Captain Hirata's base was a secret. How did the enemy know to attack us here? If we get reinforcements there is a chance that will attract even more attention. Although true, this base is not supposed to be some kind of refuge! It is a military base from which we are to launch attacks! Since we need more planes now, I ask you to submit a request to Headquarters. I will make the request but it will not be easy. We recently contacted them about getting more food. We're quickly losing air superiority. Our squadron is trying to control a very important sea area. Can our aircraft carriers come protect our base? The aircraft carrier is now all-important. But we have none in the area. The important point is a total lack of military equipment! Midway is just another example of how important getting quick reinforcements from headquarters is. To defend our interests, an aircraft carrier needs to be stationed at Rabaul. Can't headquarters help us? Bastards... If we had 20 more planes. Just 20! If we had the staff to carefully monitor the condition of our aircraft... It was my fault that some planes were out of order! How did you let that happen? Stop it! I am... Hirata! Honda. Is it really you, Honda?! How did you get here? I've been scouting enemy military installations at Guadalcanal. It's great that you are here! It is great to see you again. What? Keep eating! When I think of the men who were with me at Guadalcanal, I imagine how happy they would have been to have seeen this much food. So now I'm embarrassed that I've gorged myself. I understand. But you are their commander. The commander cannot perform his duties if he is malnourished. So let's eat and gain strength! Thanks! But I have already eaten. How nice to meet a friend in foreign lands. Are you full? Do not be shy! Before coming here from the city of Manchow, I returned home and arranged Nobu’s grave. Really? Good. Because it seems like I killed her, it was even harder on the soul. But how nice it is to kill enemy on the battlefield. By the way, I heard that the landowner's daughter had married. Is that so? Didn't she really love you? You rejected her, right? Such was the case. But that was a long time ago. So, Hirata, now we are both sorry about the past. It's not like you to be so moody. Things haven't been normal for a long time. But now you can make a surprise attack. Attack? Yes. I go back under cover of darkness and find all their hiding places. And so we will. Now, Honda, maybe we should sing? Let's. Come on. The one we used to sing all the time. Good... Three, four.. What time is it now? 8:02 Then I shouldn't keep them waiting. Are you leaving already? Well... Hirata, I'm glad we met. Now I'm not afraid to die. Take care of yourself. Honda. Junior Lieutenant Umemoto and his squadron are ready to fly! Great! Do your best. Yes, sir! Take off! Commander, I found a new paint brush. Later today, I will draw you. Good. Then I will shave carefully. Yes! Enemy aircraft on the right. Forward! The closest enemy formation - 150 aircraft. Now we are preparing to attack. 30 vs 150. The odds are five to one against them. We are too few. Sir! What are you going to do? You can’t send them there. It's just lambs to the slaughter. I beg you! Junior Lieutenant Umemoto reporting. You're the only one? Yes, sir! Shindo and Ono died in battle. What about Yamashita? I do not know. In the heat of battle, it was difficult to make out. I see. So there is still hope. OK, get some rest. Yes! Captain. Their fuel would have run out an hour ago. Yamashita is gone. February 2 - Japanese troops evacuate Guadalcanal As for the squadron which carried out the attack, when I decided to retreat, it was too late. Enough. Without question, they all fell for the good of our country. So do not worry. Rest. Yes. Allow me to report! Proceed. I brought Yamashita's personal effects. All right. We need to send all these things to his family. Yes, sir! Komatsu, are your parents alive? Yes, my mother lives in a village. Do you write her often? Yes! But I have eight brothers. Even if I die, they will take good care of her. So don’t worry about me! Fool! To speak so dismissively of death is disrespect to parents! Yes, sir! Komatsu, the life of every fighter on the battlefield is important. He who survives war, wins! So think about that, Komatsu. Winning this war is not so simple. And you can never win if you don’t value life. Yes, sir! Dismissed. Leaving! April 18, 1943 - Admiral Yamamoto arrives in the Solomon Islands Given our enforced inactivity, we all understand how our task has become even more difficult. Therefore, I hope that you will fight hard in the upcoming offensive. You must be courageous as befits a warrior. I am counting on you. That is all. Salute! At ease! Admiral! Captain Hirata. I will lead your fighter escort today. Good. Ah, it's you. Are you a Iguchi guard? I'm honored that you remember me! I can see how much you have had to endure. I count on you. Yes, sir! As Admiral Yamamoto's plane left Rabaul, American fighter planes were waiting for him because they had intercepted and decrypted a Japanese radio message. Descend immediately to base. Defend the admiral! Admiral! Bastards! Admiral! Captain. The captain is back! Captain! Captain! Captain! Do not do this! - Let go! - Please! I killed the admiral. His plane was shot down. I could not defend him against all the enemy aircraft. Komatsu! Don't! Let me go. I beg you! Captain, please! Komatsu, let go! Komatsu, please! Let go. Captain! Captain, that's not true! You yourself told me how important life is. You, captain. You, captain! Captain, do not kill yourself. Please, I beg you. You're a good man, captain! Captain... Captain! Captain! Wake up! Captain! Captain, don't pass out. Captain! Stay with us, captain. Captain... Mr. Hirata! We have not met for a long time. Yes, a lot of time has passed. Have you been at the front all this time? Yes. It’s good that you came back safe and sound. When did you get here? This morning. Although I have come back, I have no one to visit. I just wanted to see my hometown again. But I'm glad I met you. Such a big guy! How old are you now? Three. Really... What about the father? My husband died at the front. He was called up for military service shortly after we got married, and there he died. Shortly before he died, I gave birth to his son. I used to think that the war only concerned other people... But it turned out so ironically. Mr. Hirata, there is no one for you? That is so. It would probably be useless asking you to marry me then? You remember how we met in Tokyo a few years ago? In fact, at that time... There’s no need to talk about it now. Why didn’t you get married? The death of a warrior is unpredictable. He can't know what awaits him tomorrow. Big boy! When you grow up, take care of your mother properly! Good boy! You will grow up to be a fine man. Sorry, but... We have to go. December 1943 Commanding Officer Captain Hirata reporting for duty. Thank you. Well, sit down. What? Your wound has not healed yet? The arm is already healed. Good. Since I myself headed the fourth squadron, it is good that we both got out in one piece. Sir, I came to talk to you. What about? I expect to go back to the front right away once I’m discharged from the hospital. I can no longer work as an instructor. You should carefully weigh your decision. Director! I am ashamed to hold such a high post among real statesmen. I... am the man who failed to protect our magnificent Admiral Yamamoto. I am... Do not say that. And I lost many of my men. While I myself stayed alive. I cannot bear to think of how many of my students are going to a certain death. Director. Send me straight to the front line. Please! No. But why? That's an order. Captain Hirata. Admiral Yamamoto handed me this letter when I took over as director. Now listen carefully. Henceforth our Empire needs such warriors, who will go fearlessly into even the most bloody battle. And I sincerely hope that in the future you not only grow excellent warriors, but also make them strong people of honor and valor. Got it? Attention! Welcome! At ease! Attention! I am the commander of your unit, Captain Hirata. It's been years now since I stood in front of my commander as you do now. Captain Okano gave his life fighting in the Philippines. And now... younger and older generations seek the single goal that we will achieve by fighting! I want you to remember this well! Having been accepted for training, I must prepare you for the difficulties of war. On the battlefield - one mistake, one second - may cost you your life. To prepare you for this, I need you to train hard! Clear? Did you understand me? Come on, come on! Push on up! Get up! Go ahead! Dammit! Faster! Well done! One-two, one-two! June 1944 - American troops land on the island of Saipan The Mitsubishi A6M5 'Zero' is equipped with 20mm cannons, has tremendous range, and excellent maneuverability. Due to the presence of these distinctive qualities... they can fight even against numerically superior enemy aircraft. Any questions? Ask! I heard you shot down countless enemy aircraft. Can you talk about the conditions in which you fought? The classroom is not a place to talk about personal achievements! Yes, sir! Do not hesitate to ask questions. Yes, sir! I want to ask... if you think that in the current military situation is it right to continue fighting? Silence! We must move forward! This is all that required of you. However, when Britain and the United States have such significant advantages, can we win simply by believing we will? Japan cannot lose! Are you afraid to die? It's not about fear of death. It is not wrong to value life. Keep quiet! You are just afraid to die! Even if true. So what? You fool! How can you go to the front where they can kill you? What do you think this is?! You are... Stop it! Tell me. Why have you come to a military academy? Answer me. Answer me! To become a good sailor in the Navy! Good! You need discipline to become a good sailor. Now go and run in circles! Yes, sir! Oisawa. How can you accept military service at such a difficult time? Hey... Since when did you become deaf and dumb? When I look at you, I feel anger down in my gut. And more. Why are you not showing some respect... to our experienced commander Hirata? Hey! Say something! Stop it! Attention! What did you do here?! Dry the oars. Raise oars! Now you will row for 20 minutes without rest. Lower oars! Get ready! Forward! 10 minutes more. Number five, what is it? Number nine, pull up! Number ten, what are you doing? Continue rowing! Five more minutes! Try again! Will he be all right? His heart... Wait! This happened because you did not row together properly! In war, this can cost you lives. You can’t work as a team! Commander Hirata! They want to meet with you. - Meet me? - Yes, sir! I am Hirata. Hello, I am the mother of Rokuske Yamashita. Yamashita's mother? Yes. Finally, his remains arrived. I wanted to thank his commander for taking care of Rokuske... and for sending so valuable a thing as the album with his drawings. There is a drawing where he portrayed his mother Yes. He loved to draw ever since he was a child. I am glad that he served his country... They say you were very worried and took care of him. No. For my part... I did not do enough to protect your son. And I apologize for that. Don't say that. I wanted to visit you earlier but didn’t know where to find you. It took me a whole week to find you. Yamashita was a good man. Not just your son but everyone else in the squadron. Almost all of them died. However, their commander remained alive. If I had such an opportunity, I would wish to die instead of Yamashita. You speak so sincerely but Rokuske was glad that his squadron leader was a good man. You know, I ... Now I train the same fine young men your son was. I'm trying to make them worthy sailors. I want them to survive on the battlefield. I prepare my students with this harsh training but in my heart I carry these experiences. I constantly have these angry outbursts with them and I feel so guilty. I can’t understand all your feelings but, as a mother, I wanted to thank the person who was looking after my son. I do not deserve your gratitude. Maybe this will sound sentimental, but your words have calmed my heart. Thank you very much for coming. July 3, 1944 - The entire garrison in the Saipan Islands gave their lives for the homeland. In October of that year, American forces landed on Leyte island in the Philippines. What's the matter? Why are you crying? Dad... Your dad died in the war from an illness. Died of an illness? In which unit? In China, at the front somewhere. I don’t know which unit. Too bad. Commander! Commander, remember when you asked me why did I want to serve in the Navy? So what? Then I did not dare say but now I will. I went into the Navy to learn English. To learn English? Yes. My father told me to go to a military school because students from ordinary schools were being immediately sent to the front. But if you go to a military school, you can study there for three years. So my father said to me: "During that time, the war is sure to end. By that time, you will have learned English well. In the Naval Academy, they teach the language of the enemy country." Then father said ... that he thinks surviving is a shame. Your father must have taught in a university. He was an English teacher. When that time... when I said I wanted to become a good sailor, I lied. I thought I would give my father a lot of trouble. But now... my father is already... not among the living. Commander. Now I understand perfectly. I understood how I was mistaken. I feel shame. Commander, make me a good sailor! Do your best. Did you call for me? You once asked to be sent back to the front line. You will go to Okinawa. Yes, sir! Sit down for now. Yes. There is only homemade coffee. Sent to me by a friend in England before the war. It will soon be over. I know you don't want sugar. Go ahead. Thank you The battle in Okinawa will be the decisive one. Although it will be difficult to win. Now you are involved in it. Probably more shameful to be a instructor than fight at the front. This war will not last more than two years. I'm afraid by the time that your pupils graduate, it will have ended already. By then, this war can no longer touch them. They will not be sailors of the Imperial Navy, but will become employees of some big businesses. What will happen to these products of an Academy education? Now I see how complicated is the task laid on you for their education. I understand how much you worry because of the deaths of so many men from your squadron. But you do a great job with this weight. You make good men from your students. What will become of Japan if it loses this war? I can’t guess but you need to nuture great people because they will become the future. Japan's fate rests on their shoulders. You need to educate them. Director. Thank you very much. I do not understand what your plans are, director, but I ... Enough. Only life is more important than this . Do not act rashly. Understand? Yes. Thank you so much. Do you feel better? Thanks to a director like you, even without me, these students can become worthy graduates. They are all capable. I will be homesick when I leave. Well, then now I will go. Tomorrow is Sunday. Have a good rest one day. By the way, tomorrow will be march training. Will you go watch with me? Yes. Commander, are you going to the front too? Is that so? Once called, nothing can be done. Not a word about this to anyone. Yes. When are you leaving? Sagawa. Yes. I tell you this just now, Like you, I too went into the Navy to study. And not to become a sailor. I didn't want to be here. But... Now that I am a sailor of the Imperial Navy I do not regret it at all. So now you know. Commander. This is something belonging to my friend who fell in battle on Guadalcanal. I pass it on to you. The ink in it has already run out. From now on... Learn. Commander... Well, dig in! What? Not glad I invited you to eat? No, that’s not the point. Let's eat. That's right. Hey Terano. You need to eat especially a lot so as not to faint again. Commander, do not mention anything about this please. Sure. Why is he so jovial? I haven’t seen him like this before. Commander, did something happen? No, nothing special. I just wanted to treat you all. -What do you think about this? Delicious? -Yes! Good. Eat up! That's an order. I have an idea. When we finish, we'll sing an old song together. -Yes! -Yes! You and I - cherry blossoms that bloom in the same time We bloom in the garden alone and the same military school Blooming flowers ready to crumble Let's show off the sake of our native country as an example You and I are cherry blossoms blooming at the same time We bloom in the garden alone and in the same air Our gaze is fixed on the blazing sunset in the southern sky The first plane to fly which will not return Squadron! Attention! Sing more energetically! Louder! Now the song on page 36! "Song of the men from Etajima Island!" ("Etajimakenji no uta") Ready! March! A place on the shores of which are cut waves of the raging ocean A place where evergreens are strong pines, an elegant island of dragonflies... Director Captain Hirata is leaving you. Thank you so much. Good luck. Jumping in my chest lively boyish fervor Ah, soldiers, honorable pillars of the state You will cease to be one of them, if you refuse to protect him. There is the sound of pines swaying in the wind, which are washed by water at the foot of the Furut mountains. When is the image of Nomi Island parting with the light in the fog Raising banner advancing forward through battle Seeing off and meeting for four years The End
