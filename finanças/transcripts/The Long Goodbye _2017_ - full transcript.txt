(The Long Goodbye) Wait… Wait a second. Mr. Xiong Qing is divorced. His ex-wife is now in a facility. I don't know he's divorced. I've been abroad for a long time. His ex-wife has some mental disorders. We were told she couldn't come to claim his body. What about his daughter? We couldn't reach her. We called her and visited her residence. Police is now tracking her whereabouts. It's legally required that only the next of kin can claim the body. Chris Phone! Coming. Hi, this is Li speaking. Yes, I am. Okay. Thank you. When he died, all he had on him was my contact information. They couldn't find his family. So… they called me from Taiwan. But…I have never heard you mention him before. We were friends in college. It's been 30 years. So have they found his family yet? I don't know. It's only happened this morning. Is there something you wanna say? No. I think you should go. (How are you? Yours, Qing) It's been a long time. Yeah. It's been a while. How are you? Is everything alright? What's your plan after military service? Do you still remember? Remember what? Things we discussed before we were drafted. Have you forgotten? You're here. I brought Xiaoyao here to let you check out this piece of art. We're getting married. A piece of art? I am not a collectible. I was joking. I must introduce you to my best friend. This… This is his daughter's address and number. The City Office already has her contact info? Yes. His daughter never showed up? Only the first time. But she always paid her fees. So we didn't… Ms. Huang is over there. Do you remember me? Li Yucheng. Xiong Qing's classmate from college. Do you know? Xiong Qing is dead. I need to find Bao'er. Your daughter. Dynasty Sauna. Hi. I'm looking for Bao'er. Ms. Xiong Bao'er. Never heard of her. You… Hi, what are you looking for? What is your rate? 800 TWD for 12 hours. Access to all facilities Not including services or meals. What facilities do you have? Just sauna. I'm leaving the country next month. I've been admitted to an American university. Wow. What program? You guys are both accomplished. On a government grant? It's what we studied in college. Agriculture. You didn't tell me about this. I applied when I was in the army. Which state in America? Indiana. It's near the east coast. Too bad you can't come to our wedding. I need to use the bathroom. Sir. Sir! You fell asleep. It's dangerous. Thank you. A massage? Sir, do you need a massage… by a young lady? Do you have a girl named Bao'er? She's about 20. Her surname is Xiong. No. But girl No.12 is quite popular. Her name is Bao Bao. Her skills are top-notch. Do you want her? Hi. I'm Bao Bao. Is it OK? Are you Bao'er? I'm Bao Bao. Do you have a girl whose surname is Xiong? Xiong? Yes. Is it OK? You're Bao'er? Do I know you? You probably don't know me. No... I'm not here for that. Relax, the first time is always… Are you not curious? I know your name. So what? I'm a friend of your father. My name is Li. Li Yucheng. Do you know… your father has passed away? I came back from the U.S. Social workers couldn't reach you or your mom. So they called me. This is my card. I went to college with your father. I can't read English. What do you want from me? You need to claim his body. I need you to come with me and sign some papers. When did he die? Last week. He… had a heart attack. He was found dead on the curb. I have nothing to do with him. What do you mean? Still want a massage? He is your father. You can find another masseuse. You can't just… Don't touch me! Please give it a thought! I'll be in Taiwan for a while. Sir, what happened? Nothing. Was her technique not good? Bad service? No, it's nothing. Thank you. It's okay. Hey, you're here. Hi, Xun. Don't read the comics. What should I read then? He wants your attention. You feel ill? No. Then why are you back so early? OK, I'm ill. Who was that guy? My father died. He came to me for that. He asked me to sign some papers, and claim his body. You and your dad were estranged. Just ignore him. Right. Actually, today… Mr. De asked me to find you. I just had an early leave for today! It's not about that. Then what's the problem? Mr. De couldn't… find a girl who does "full service". He wanted me to ask you… You recommended your own girlfriend? Fuck! Get out! Get out! This is not my idea. Do you offer full service? No. I'll pay 1,000 extra dollars. Sorry. I don't do full service. How much do you want? 2,000? 3,000? You know why I didn't visit you often? Because I'm exhausted. Exhausted. Good-bye. Remember to shut the door. What's your relation to my dad? I was his… best friend in college. Then I went to study abroad. He started his own businessman in China… 10 million. What? I'll claim his body… if you give me 10 million TWD. What are you talking about? My dad… took out a huge loan in my name and my mom's. My mom had a breakdown and got into that hospital. I'm now paying her expenses and his debt. These are two separate matters. After all, he is your father. No matter what, you should take care of his funeral. This is your duty as his daughter. You can't blackmail me for his error. 5 million. You're a rich man. It's not much for you. If you need to pay off the debt, we can figure out another solution. 2 million. It's up to you if you want to do the right thing. Money shouldn't be involved. If you don't want to help, I'll manage by myself. Don't you wanna help me? Aren't you my dad's best friend? I am your best friend's daughter. No matter what he did to you and your mom, he suffered in his last years and died in anguish. He will always be your father. You have to face him to get a closure and move on… Just come with me. We can figure out a way… to help you pay off your debt. You want to help me, but you won't give me any money? Bao'er, stop! I said stop! Motherfucker! What are you doing? Fuck! Are you dumb? You lost your words? How do you want to resolve this? Bao'er… Why are you doing this to me? Answer him! What are you looking at? Get him! Where are you going? You sneaky bastard. We've taken your photos. All right. We'll tell your wife. Listen to me. I don't live in Taiwan. You can't blackmail me. Sir, here is his phone. It's fine… if we don't want to pay us. We'll just tell your wife about your dirty secret. Enough! What are you doing? Just be quiet. Why is it all in English? Give it back! What's the password? Give it back! What the hell? Don't hit him. I'll call the police! Call the police? With what? You wanna call the police? Give me the password. Are you all right? Excuse me. I'm sorry… Boss! I'm sorry… I didn't mean to do it. You promised you wouldn't hurt him. You've turned against me? Don't be an ungrateful bitch. I'll sort you out later. You're all right, Bao'er? She's fine. But you're in big trouble. Calm down, boss! We haven't got his money yet. Boss! You're scared? Take him away! Have you lost your mind? If you take him, it'll be kidnapping. I'll become an accomplice. Are you scared? Then just quit. I'll come find you later. Even a stranger cares about me more than you do! Fuck you! 911, how can I help you? Hello? What are you doing? Cut it off! I'm calling the police. Are you crazy? Gimme the phone! I'm held hostage! I'm in Da-Hua Street! No.1, Lane 3… We've located your position and will arrive soon. Come save me! Run! Hurry! I was such an fool! Boss… The police is coming. What about other girls? Take them away! Just drive! When the police get here, we won't get away. Get off my car! Why did you set me up? Why? I called the police with this phone. Can they track my location? I should turn it off. What was that place? Our dormitory! I forgot my cat! Get off my car. I don't need you anymore. It wasn't my idea. Then whose idea was it? Xun's. Who is he? The one who beat you up. So what happened? Were you held captive? Or you came up with this plan together? I wasn't held captive. If you weren't forced, why would you be a prostitute? Have you thought of your father? What are you? A five year old? I was 18 when my dad dumped his debt on me. What options did I have? So those thugs thought I was rich, and asked you to set me up. And you agreed! So… Even you didn't want to hurt me, you called the police for your own sake. Get off the car right now! I thought you wanted to help me. Get off! You're his daughter? Just call him the way you used to. Ask him to move in the urn. Sir. Call him the way you used to. Ask him to move in here. The police raided our place. The boss is furious. Where are you? You smell of booze! It's stinky. What? I am bored. Just want to check on you. How luxurious! Gimme some money. I ran out of clothes to wear. You want some? No. I can't drink. You're like your dad. I don't really know him. But my mom… She can hold her liquor well. You know what? I used to throw parties with your dad in college. He was... a heartthrob back then. The girls were all swept away… by his charm. He and I… once courted the same girl. She had long hair. But her face… has slipped my memory. Why did you lose contact with him? You didn't visit him afterwards? After the military service… your dad brought your mom to see me. We... kept in touch. He used to write me Christmas cards. Then later… It must be that I rejected his… Rejected what? What did you reject? You're drunk? You're really wasted! Why do you drink so much? I haven't got my money yet. Where is his wallet? Who is this? Hello? Hey Chris. Hello? Hello? Who is this? How are you? How are you? I'm fine. Thank you. Where's Chris? Chris Li I wanna talk to Chris Li. Chris Li Fuck you! (Come down for breakfast when you get up.) Just help yourself. Where did you sleep? Your room. Why was I in your bed? Should I have left you on the floor? I fell asleep on the floor? You didn't touch me, right? How did I put you to bed without touching you? Don't be an idiot. You understand my question. I was asking… Speaking of idiocy, you took a call on my phone and insulted my wife. She is your wife? I was just messing with her. I don't understand English. You can't? But you knew how to say "fuck you." I only know a few sentences. Like "how are you?" "I'm fine." "Thank you." "Fuck you!" "You are pretty." She thought I was having an affair. Look at the camera and apologize. Are you recording? Stop it! Say sorry. You're such a prude. I'm sorry! Bow down. What the hell? You're quite something. Married a foreign wife… Do you have kids? He's pretty cute. How old is he? He'll graduate from college soon. You said you rejected some request from my dad. What was it? What? You said it yourself. You forgot? What are you talking about? I bought a spot at the columbarium. You can visit your dad with your mom when you want to. Is Xun really your boyfriend? Kind of. I'm still quite mad at you, but… I'm worried about your future. How much do you owe? After we sold our house, there are still… When will you go back? If you're not in a hurry, we can have a road trip. So I can clear my head to think about my future. This is your last visit, right? Hey! "I must go to the beach every summer" "The chicks from Kaohsiung are so hot!" Hi, sir. We'd like to make friends with your daughter. What? She said her father was here. I suppose she meant you. His father is here. 你Just ask him. How? With an Ouija board? Idiot! Hi, mister. Your daughter is very cute. We want to be her friends. Really? Thank you so much! Your dad said yes. He said we were good-looking. Did you hear them? Excuse me. Is Xiong Bao'er staying in this hotel? Do you know her room number? No. Sorry, we can't provide personal information. Hey. Thanks. Bye-bye! Bye-bye! College students? I suppose so. Did you go to college? Nope. What's wrong with you? Why do you carry my dad's urn? It's my own business. If those things didn't happen, what would you be doing? You mean if I didn't have to pay the debt and care for my mother? I would be working in Australia and saving for a trip to the Great Barrier Reef. Why Australia? It's a popular choice. I could harvest wool and pick fruits. The pay is good. I think you can do the same things in Taiwan. You just don't get it. It's a different experience. I do get it. I've been abroad for 30 years. So after wool-harvesting and fruit-picking, what's next then? Falling in love! After that? I think I might go to college. Why? Everyone is a college graduate here. Have you considered studying in the U.S.? You can just… leave your debt. Come study in the U.S. I can help you. What about my mother? Don't worry. I will also take care of… her expenses at the hospital. Your mother… You think she faked her illness? Right? What do you mean? She had no choice. There was nothing she could do. I gave her… my phone number. I hoped she could call me one day and know how my life turned out. My mom… she had a miserable life. Ever since I was born, her marriage with my dad… was practically dead. You dad… did take care of you before his business went under, right? Took care of us? He abandoned us. He was not like you. You have everything. How nice. Forget it. One day… I'll pay off the debt by myself. I can't… leave my mother alone. Can't you just leave your baggage? What do you know? It's none of your business! I decided our itinerary for the past few days. You can pick our next stop tomorrow. What's this place? A ball room. Excuse me. A bottle of AnCnoc Cutter, please. Thanks. What's that? Whiskey. Thank you. Cheers. Why are you laughing? What kind of dance is this? I danced a lot when I was young. Impressive. Well, I'm a little rusty now. You stepped on my foot! Sorry. It was my fault. Do you know how to do a spin turn? What happened? The next song. Ma'am, have a dance, please? What? Can we have a dance, please? He'd like to dance with you. OK No, no… Just guide her through this. It's all right. Be a lady. You have your dad's eyes. I came here to tell you my answer. But you don't seem to need it now. It's already too late. Why did you run away? I needed time to clear my head. Then why did you leave the country? You also did that on a whim? I can't sit here any longer. Xing Qing. What's wrong? They killed my cat! It's all right. Hold me tight. Your dad is not the only one who ran away. I'm also a fugitive. Your dad… confessed to me… before he went into the army. He said… he had feelings for me. But I rejected him. I thought about it long and hard. I really did. After I was discharged, I asked him out. I prepared to tell him… that I made up my mind. I accepted that I loved him as well. But… he brought your mother, telling me… she was his fiancee. So I avoided him. I ran away. I fled to the U.S. and never came back. So… you were…? You're the first one that I revealed my secret to. I should have figured out… why you cared so much about my dad. I thought… maybe you liked me. Maybe… I could be your young lover, and leave all my problems behind. I looked for you for days. Come home. You've taken care of your dad's business. He'll just forget you. Come home. Please… Please don't. Not now. Hi. Hi. I'm finished now. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. I… I need to tell you something. Sir. I'm so sorry. We'll get you another masseuse. And reset your service hours. What? I'm sorry. What? Sorry. You made up your mind? If so, sit down and talk. Xun. Sit. Okay. I don't need a father. I don't need a girlfriend, either.
