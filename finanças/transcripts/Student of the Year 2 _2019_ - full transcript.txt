Her comp try outs are on. Mridula? CUT! Cut the sound. What's wrong Mikey baby? Are you ill? Haven't slept enough... or did your girl dump you for someone else? Huh? Huh? Why is the tempo so fast? Shreya, this has always been the original speed. Who's on speed, I know. Now shut up and take it from the top. She's good han. MRIDULA! Rohan? Okay! Who's the duffer now? Huh? Er... Sorry. I was just calling out to my girlfriend. Wa- wait, wait, wait, wait. Aren't you that Pishori boy? You're here for a donation? I'm a new student. I've just enrolled. Wow! Teresa's standards have really dropped. Yes of course! If you're the one setting it. WHAT? The tempo isn't fast! You're slow. Oh really? Why don't you come and show us then?

I'm here to make something of myself... not for anyone else. Mridula, i'm here for... It's MIA! Bye Ro. Bro. Get the dip! George Wickham! Who's that? You see, If Mr. Darcey does everything for Elizabeth ...and she turns around and says "thank you but... I'm not interested ". It means her agenda has shifted from Mr. Darcey to Wickham Guys...

Rohan has got all you guys in. But what about costumes? We are not dressed. That's ok... We'll go as regular people. Superheros need to rescue someone right? So cute! I told you Abhishek? The boy may have left Pishori but Pishori hasn't left the boy. Hit me! Bro, what's in the brown bottle? Vinegar We'll have it if its free Guys! Hey Rohan... brother! what are you guys doing here?

Just leave! Rohan! Tell them! That's just great. If I had a good come back I would have said it just about now. I'll think about it and text you later. Such a shallow guy. Let's go. He's not our friend anymore. Let's go. - Mia? Listen to me! - You know what Rohan? Make up your mind! Either you're here or there. Mia I am with you. Listen...I didn't get them in— Then who did? Hey Duffer! That's my spot. Oh! Reserved for ladies? Is it? You've messed with the wrong girl. DUFFER! The leading economic indicators are income and wages... - Unemployment rate.. - ROHAN! ROHAN! Your bike. Just come. Come fast. Now here's a lady-like bike. Park here now. Princess! Er.. Sir tea? It's getting cold. Mr.Gujral, please talk. You see normally... I ignore all her childish tantrums. I'm confused about what to do. On one hand your son Manav. He's the pride of St. Teresa. and her? She's his-- Uhh... Sister sir. SIBLING! Sibling sir. Totally opposite. Manav-- Can you understand where I'm coming from. Sir. Sir-- Mr. Randhava please-- The next time, I get the smallest complaint against you... I'll break your face. Your damages will be taken care of. You're leaning on the wrong leg. Shreya? I know we hit it off on the wrong foot... But you hate me that much? Listen cant we- Can't we just be friends? The dance competition is in four days. Don't go soft now. Or I'll loose the thrill of taking you down. Bro she crossed the line and you're on a guilt trip? Just chill out man. She wants to join some dance school in the UK, for two years. No wonder she's taking the competition so seriously. Dad has allowed her to participate only on one condition. It has to be with me. Whoa! So... That means... We are going to be rivals in the dance competition? Aha... But dude... Word of caution... my doctor has advised me against losing. Then you need to consult a new one. Because Mia's dream is greater than your ego... Which I will fulfill for her. We'll win right? Should I sign it off for you? Yes please! Good thing you cut your name short to Mia. Mridula would have been complicated. Ladies and gentlemen... The judges have made their decision. And the winners of the dance competition are... Shreya and Manav! Smile. Mia? Losing is not in my blood. Rohan! The dean has called you. Did you hit Manav Randhawa last night? Yes sir... But sir that happened outside college premises. Does it really matter Rohan? Outside. Inside. You know who his father is right? Sir, I do... but he was with my girlfriend and-- I know! But this issue has escalated to the board. And I'm really helpless. Here. Your expulsion letter. You've been thrown out of St.Teresa. S-Sir... This is not fair. I'm sorry. Look i'm sorry ok. But I had warned you... I don't like to loose. Listen! Why don't you get lost you cheat. Cheat? That's your come back? Really? What were you expecting? You'll get in here with a charity scholarship and fit right in? Just look at him guys. The loser of Pishori... is out to become the stud of Teresa. Did you forget your place. What are you looking at? I took pity on you and got you under my wing... Invited you to my Birthday... included you in the team. You know why? Because you would have been a good sidekick. But you were out to trample on me? Teresa's champ! Rohan Sachdev? Why did you have to involve Mia? Do you still think I had to do anything? Bro, look at you. And look at me. She just chose man. Fair and square. Let go! Let go! Girlfriend in one hand and trophy in the other. And this college as a backdrop. That was your aim in life right? But this is who you are... a small town boy. Not Student... Loser of the Year! Come on Rohaaaannn! Come on you can do it. Come on Ro! Not Student... Loser of the Year! Let it be. Before cleaning all this up, clear your head. Rohan! My son, she was trying to find her own self. She wanted to do a lot of things. But... what do you want to do? Have you thought about that? What do you call "Talent" in english? Talent. Work on your talent son... destiny will fall in it's place. What had you called me? Loser of the year? But the year isn't over yet my friend. Look Hero... What had to happen, happened! And to be honest, it shouldn't have. So for that...I'm sorry. And anyway... Let's just move on buddy. What's the connection between us anyhow? The connection is made my friend. Which can't be broken now. Mia will always remain my ex girlfriend. And you... The Stud of Teresa... ...who will lose the Diginity trophy... ...to Pishorilal Chamandas College. And... ...the Student of the Year title to me. I've won two years in a row buddy. I'm going to get the hat-trick too. I had just one dream in my life. You snatched from me. So I have to return the favor, right? I guess after my trashing... ...you've lost your mind and forgotten your place. It's not about that anymore. It's now about my self respect. And the day I get into your side of the court... I'll strip you off your pride and you wouldn't even know what hit you. The day was yours, But I'll seize the year! I knew it from the very beginning... That after going on this sabbatical my Rohan would definitely come home. Now that you're back, take over your team and get back to your captaincy. No Ma'am, Let Abhishek remain the captain. I just want to stay in the team and compete for Student. Son, think of it this way, you weren't expelled. You were sent back to us for a reason. Now with your help, we'll thrash Ghanshyam. Hey! looked all over for you. I needed a favor. Just as you got Rohan expelled from college... ...can you get Manav out too? What? I'll pay you! Cash! I didn't get Rohan expelled. Of course! you just betrayed him. Cheated me. Right? Oh I'm so sorry. You got all that you desired because of me. And you won the trophy. Tch... tch... tch... With your bloody charity? Your life must be so difficult right? You're just a poor little rich girl, who kind of has a problem with everything. Wow! You have no clue what you did. Right? Listen, I know exactly what I've done. Okay? How I did it was wrong. And I regret only that. Cool? Well... even I have a regret... That you couldn't win the trophy. So here! To the best sister-in-law. Of the week. Puggi your boxers have a hole! Puggi your boxers have a hole! Puggi your boxers have a hole! Romeo! Take a number and sit in the reserve. I'll call you when it's your turn. What are you looking at? It's your 'Captains' order. Come on guys, What are you'll looking at me for? You'll want to sit there too? Practice your in-turn out-turn. Come on. Come on! Let's go... or I'll send you'll out too. Nice College. NOT! Come here fast. Chill! Couriers are expensive so I thought... Ohh...k... Look! I know it's not easy. Mutual disrespect and all that. But the common point is that... ...as cheated and hurt as you are... I am too! Because even I didn't know! But now I know... ...that there's only one way to get back at Manav and Mia. Dehradhun's biggest dance competition. Even bigger than college one! Pair up with me. Your talent and my hard work. We'll win it and show those cheats! What say? Whatever. Hey Juliet! This is perfect. Take this loser's help to become a winner. Go for it! Go for it! Loser? Really? Because he trusted someone blindly? And gave up everything for her? And what about the fact that he betrayed us? What was our fault? You saw it all at Jeffrey's that night right? Dorks! That was all my doing. I used Rohan's name and sent you'll in. You'll ruined a life long friendship over few minutes of misunderstanding? What a line, anyway... Loser! Loser! Loser! Loser! Duffer! Idiot! I made a mistake by coming here. Abhishek, I think I have a weird cramp. Please let Rohan play instead of me? Come on guys! Take your positions. Let's begin with defense practice. Come on! Come on, let's play. Come on boys! Thigh hold. - What the hell is she doing? - What is she doing? You're just taking advantage of us since we forgave you. Out of all the places you get us to Jeffrey's? Let's stay together or we'll get beaten up again. If you have to prove something, prove it to yourself. Not to anyone else. Especially to the both of them. You're real competition is the mirror. Sorry. Can't hear you. He still affects you so much? Manav tell me the truth ... Do you love me or is this all just to teach Rohan a lesson? I love this small town girl insecurity. Yes! Yes! I know. We've got only 5 minutes to go! Come! Lets go! Cake? Rusty's birthday. Want some? Man! You do need to get some friends. And by friends... I don't mean Rohan. All the attention that he's giving you... I hope you know why. Just to get to me. Attention? One must respect women. Because even dogs can give attention. Come my boy. Come! Come! Come! Sit! Wait! Stay! Happy birthday to me... Happy birthday to me... Happy birthday dear Shreya... Happy birthday to me! Thank you! Thank you everyone! You are all here for my birthday? Really means a lot guys! This first bite... For my mom... Then dad... Manav who I hate... And finally! My main man. Come here Rusty. Come here! Happy birthday! Shreya! Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Shreya... Happy birthday to you. What did you think? If you didn't mention it, I wouldn't find out? But how did you find out? I had sent you a friend request on facebook. Such a dead birthday? I mean how come no big Jeffrey's party? Dad was insisting but I didn't want to. Come. Thank you duffer. But why don't you say something to her? You have every right to. What can I say that she already doesn't know? Insulting Mia is like insulting my love for her. Which I can never possibly do. People can say whatever they want Shreya... but twelve years of love... doesn't turn to hate in four days. Twelve years of love versus four days of hate? That's sick! Sick? Who is sick? Dude! I've surely fallen for you. My tweleve-year timer starts, NOW! Well, I'm serious! The way you have loved Mia... If someone gives me ten even percent of that... just ten percent of that... then i'll never let go of him. What? Do you understand life long? When you're 91 years old and lying in a hospital on your death bed... you won't have your uncle and aunt or your lame Pishori friends holding your hand... But instead just one person.. Nurse Nancy? It's confirmed! You are a duffer. Dude! I'm so so so happy! You know... the stupid toy that you win in a cornflakes box... I've never even won that! - What? Really? - Yes! The entire house is filled with Manav's trophies. But now... Here! What? Why are you giving it to me? It's yours. If I take it home... It will create a scene. What is it? Where did it come from? You're lying and all that drama. I mean but-- You've worked so hard for it. No Rohan. It won't matter to anybody! The men in my house? They're not like you. And your Mom? While giving birth to me she... Dad calls me 'Jinxed'. Now you understand why we don't celebrate my birthday. Mia? I'm not with Manav anymore Ro. Wow! Now? I'm really sorry Ro! I had no idea Manav would behave like that. Please! Let me handle her! - You know what I can't believe-- - Can we talk someplace else? Please. Yeah. Sure. Couldn't you just send a text message? Ok guys. This is really awkward. So I'm just gonna explain the rules once. Please no one is going to cry or scream... are we clear? - Shreya please. I don't-- - Why are you looking at me? Why would I cry? She'll cry. Drama queen! Shreya... Please... Calm down... Please... Ro... I was wrong. And you were right. I was just looking out for myself and... I got carried away. Oh my god! What I did to you... And what I lost in return— Oh my god! Are you serious? Look! I know I've lost you Ro. If you don't want to get back with me... Don't. If you don't want to talk to me... Don't. Ok cool! So you're done right? Come Rohan! Let's go. Shreya please. Please. Continue. But please.. Don't hate me Ro. Just... Please don't hate me! Rohan... Don't fall for this. This is all just a game. Shreya please... I still love him. And guess what? So do I! What? You had your chance and you messed it up. Now its my turn. It's fair! Shreya stop behaving like a child-- Yes! And you're being very mature right? Rohan- Manav-Rohan! Are you a girl or a shuttlecock? Rohan, you don't have to explain anything to her... You know what... Instead of sorry have some coffee! ARE YOU CRAZY? HAVE YOU TOTALLY LOST IT? Mia I'm so sorry... Are you ok? Did you burn your hand? Leave Shreya! I want to go to London... To a dance school. I've kept repeating myself... Don't you get it? Should I explain it to you another way? Ahhh... Excuse me sir! Sir... May I come in please? You? What has she done this time? This Sir! 'Your Daughter' has done this. What is this? Sir, 'Your Daughter' won this trophy last night... 'Your Daughter' isn't just the best dancer in Teresa... but of the entire city. I'm sure this must be a very proud moment for you... Isn't it sir? But can you believe it? She was afraid to tell you. But I told her sir... If your father feels so happy on his sons smallest achievements ... then just imagine... how happy he would feel for his daughter's first big win. Isn't it sir? Right sir! I'll make a move. Sorry to take your time. And Shreya... Congratulations! Sir I don't know about your son... But your daughter is incredible. Good Morning Students! Good Morning Sir! Being the official hosts of this great event... It gives me great pleasure to declare... The 29th... Annunal... Inter College... Dignity Cup... OPENNNNN!! The Dignity tournament will commence in one month . Ohhh! Manasvi? Happy birthday dear Manasvi. Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday to you... Ole oleole! How old is the diva now? Enjoy this moment for now! By the end of the competition you'll forget your name too. Awwwww...Manasvi is offended. What's the diva doing in that team? Do one thing, come on to our team. No one will tease you here. Go Puggi... Give him a hug. Come my baby doll. Awwwww. Wishing all the teams best of luck... May the best team win. Bro did you see his face? It turned this small? Who did that? Who did it? Bro, why are you hitting us? Hey... Abu, run. I'm sorry Ro! Please just forget about it. Rohan! Manav and the Teresa boys are beating Puggi. Go! Go! Go quick! Go! Come. Please let them go. Now do you remember my name? Did you recollect it? Hit him. Come on Rohan! Come on hit him! Rohan... Rohan stop. Stop son! Let go! Pull him away. Hi! Hi! How's he? He's got six stitches on his head. But the doctor says not to worry. Guys, anyone wants a coffee? - Yes i'd like a cappuc--... - NO! Nevermind... I've stopped drinking Coffee... Too much caffeine. Listen Mia... I'm really so sorry... I was just being so stupid. You love him right? Love? It's a big word. But the way Rohan loves you... My love seems like a small schoolgirl crush. Summer love I guess. But Mia... If you try to hurt him again... I swear to god... I wont let you get away with it... nor this duffer! Great! Here! Don't blush. It's not for you, It's for Abhishek. He'll be fine. Shreya! Don't tell me! She ran away with the doctor? You ok? Thanks for talking to my dad. Thanks to you dad's sending me to London. What? To graduate from London School of Dance. That's great! Your dream! Finally! When? At the end of this term. But don't worry... I wont miss the joy of watching you lose Student. I'm a Teresaite after all. Shreya... I love you. But I don't. Abhishek. Thank god! His eye is not hurt. That's all ok now... But why don't you ask these idiots what happened? Idiots! Will you'll tell us what happened? Sir...How should I put it? Rohan's challenge backfired on all of us. The challenge was Rohan's... but the team is ours right? My least favorite player in this room is Rohan. But he is the one who came to my rescue. Those Terisaites... they play as a team. And we? We have lost even before we started. You know guys... Just once in our lives let's play as a team. Then we'll see what happens. That's the spirit. Lets all say together, 'Praise the Lord!' Praise the Lord! Silence! This is a hospital. Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! 'Praise the Lord!' Praise the Lord! The three important rules of Kabaddi. Number one... RESISTANCE! Become invincible! So that no one can ever get to you. Team work! Play like a team... If you stay together... you'll survive longer. COME ONNNNNN! Power! Use your strength in such a way... that you destroy your opponent! And it's finally the big day! Welcome to the Dignity Cup 2019! I am Dimpy, your ex student. And i'm, the one and only Jeet Khuraana! Eight colleges from Dehradhun and Mussoorie, will compete against each other... for the years biggest sports competition... which will be held for three days! Athletics on day one and Kabaddi on the remaining two days! The team that scores the highest points in both events... will win the Dignity Cup! And the best player of the best team will win STUDENT OF THE YEAR! The first race of the first day. Hundred meter race! Manav Singh Randhawa holds the record for this. And he is competing for his Student of the year hat-trick this year! - Come on, come on! - Let's go Rohan! The race begins! The competition underway... And oh my god! Rohan's just taken off. He is in the lead. Wait! hold on! WHAT A FINISH! Manav wins the hundred meters for the third time in a row! Too good! Manav has broken his own record! But no worry. The day has just begun. Up next... 400 meters. Ready! Steady! Go! Pishori makes a stellar start. Rohan bolts like a rocket. And once again Manav picks up speed... And....Manav Randhawa wins again! This is a super start. And Teresa is aiming for the Dignity cup once again. Pishori can't seem to make a clean finish. Let's wait a see how the 800 meter race turns out. What is happening out there? Pay attention to the sign's. The strategy! Watch him. He tires you out... and in the final thirty meters he over takes you. Don't worry sir! This time...the last thirty meters will start fifty meters in advance. Yeah. 800 meter race. And Pishori in the lead once again... Sweet! but.. is he making the same mistake once again? Round one in speed... Round two... Leisure Lap. Where runners drop their speed. And as expected, Manav overtakes once again. Looks like Manav-- Wait, hold on-- STRATEGY! Rohan used Manav's own game on him. This is Pishori's first win in the athletic games. WHAT A DAY! Manav is shocked. Coach's are worried. Pishori ecstatic. 10 points to Pishori. Amazing competition! And the result of the other games... Waltham! Teresa! Pishori! Greenfield! Teresa! Amazing play by Pishori. That's a new record. Teresa is slipping. Well done Pishori. Hurdles! End of day one! And we wrap with the Athletic round. Defending champion Teresa is on number one. But surprise package Pishori, that loses every year, is now on the fifth position. Welcome to Day 2 of the Dignity Cup. And this is the main sport of the competition... KABADDI! The first game is between last years winners St. Teresa versus Greenfield!! By the way Kabaddi is Teresa's strong suit. And here is their final year team led by Manav Randhawa! The defending champion of Student of the Year. If he maintains his form Then he can be a part of the north belt team of the All India Pro Kabaddi, the coming year. One! Two... and...FLIP! Two points to Teresa quite easily! And he is caught... SLAM! Lift and Drop... BRUTAL! Thrown in the sidelines. Easy win for Teresa. 37 to 12. And they stay on the top! Pishori! Pishori! Pishori! And this match is between last years runner up team Springdales and Pishori. who was last years last team. And the first raid... the captian of Springdales Vikas. Rohan, look out! Bonus point! Dive and OUT! Springdales takes it away! First point to Springdales right away! And now its Pishori's turn. Their captain Abhishek comes in for the first raid. Seems like Pishori is intimidated by this sport. The match is heading towards a predictable outcome... one after the other, all Pishori players are out. It's just Rohan Sachdev. Last man standing. If he loses... they'll lose the match. Come on... go for it. Come on Rohan! And this is Rohan's first raid in the Dignity Cup 2019. And against him are seven very experienced players. Tackle one! Tackle two! Toe touch... toe touch and flip! OH MY GOD! Rohan's locked it in! That was amazing! Pishori gets three points and three players are back in the game. I didn't expect this. Rohan has come out as the motivating factor for his team! Leg grab! And and and... Good tackle and roll! I've never ever seen this happen in Kabaddi I don't know about Kabaddi But if this was Gymnastics, I would have given them 10 points for this! Pishori WINS! Its day two's biggest upset. The tournament commences with such a big shocker! The college that always lost has defeated last years runner up team! Pishori has now climbed from number 5 to number 4. We won! Come here. How do you feel now? Just like sex! There's no guarantee that if you get it once, you'd get it again! Brother we just got lucky. We were this close to losing. Do you guys remember the 1983 world cup? Those days West Indies was Teresa. and India... was Pishori. And no one could defeat West Indies. Obviously no one took us seriously. But just those eleven players... they took the game seriously. Let them have all the talent in the world. We just need one talent... To play together. As a team. Yes. This one's for Pishorilal. The surprise package of day one! Pishorilal Chamandas... who is slowly but steading winning all their matches! One inspires the other. Great team work! But it's all thanks to their star player Rohan Sachdev! Anything is possible... just like Rohan's jumps. Pishori is climbing the pool table. Teresa has made it a point. Tomorrow, the Dignity cup will be theirs and Student Trophy Manav's! Semi Final two. Raichand Versus Pishori. And look at them play! A new and improved Pishori team. And they have made it a point to win. They're not going easy on their opponent. What a team effort. I don't believe it! Yesderday's loser team Pishorilal Chamandas is in the FINALS! PISHORI WINS! Pishori! Pishori! Pishori! Pishori! Pishori! Pishori! Pishori! Pishori! Pishori! Pishori! I just can't believe it! I'm so happy. I mean Ro... it's the finals! Finals! I'm so so happy. What's wrong? You're still upset? What did you think Mia? Just by saying sorry everything will go back to the same? It's not that easy. I know. But I've changed Rohan. First I thought the way I handled it was wrong. But now I know everything about it was wrong. I messed up. And you can punish me anyhow you like. And now I'm supposed to worry about this too? No Mia. I just want to make my dreams come true. Because I owe it to myself and I'm the one responsible for it. And what if I say your dreams are now my dreams? What then? Then I'd say don't make the same mistake I made. You're right. But know this... I'll always love you. Have you seen Shreya? Shreya? Nah... She's not here. Even I was looking for her. What happened? Gave up so quickly? Not yet. And anyway how can you miss the chance to watch me lose? Rohan! Bro! Make it quick. Everyone's waiting for you in the locker room. Shall we? Why? One cheerleader wasn't enough? Mia is just my friend Shreya. She's my past. And me? My present. And your future? When I'm 91 years old... and on my death bed... there'll only be one person besides me. Nurse Nancy? You! Can you stand by my side until then? Duffer! My timer is already ticking. Bro enough already. Should we play now? He's right Rohan. Now only one thing matters. Student of the Year! Ladies and gentlemen... Welcome to the Final Day of the Dignity Cup! This is the final match! Teresa's versus Pishori. Whichever team wins.. gets the cup and the best player wins the Student trophy! I heard that there was a challenge between these two teams? But the real decision will be made on the pitch. Today we'll known the difference between men and boys. Which means on one side we have... two times defending champion, Manav Singh Randhawa! And on the other side... Underdog rising star... Rohan Sachdev! First raid Teresa's Best foot forward. Team captain Manav's confident entry. To this day... Manav hasn't lost a raid in this tournament. Wowwwww and... Bonus point!. And here it comes... Here we go... MAGIC KICK! And rockstar return! What a play! 3-0. Teresa gets it's first points through Manav's super raid. And he's-- Abhishek Flat out! Bad start for Pishori. Teresa gets one more point. 4-0 Next raid, Vikram from Teresa comes in. And he takes it too! Pishori team is unsteady. Choking during the finals. 5-0 If it continues like this... it will be a one sided match. Come on Rohan. The star player of Pishori... Rohan comes in for the next raid. The last resort! If Rohan fails this time, the game is over for them. Tackle one... Tackle two... Toe Touch! Kick! and... signature FLIP! And he makes it out! They have lifted themselves from the sideline. Score 5-2 This guy is something! If anyone can challenge Manav for Student of the Year then it's only him. Two players from Pishori are back in. With new found energy! And once again Rohan inspires the team. Pishori... FIGHT BACK! Score level 10 all. Roll... Roll... Roll... And point. Wow! Pishori is finally doing it. Now Pishori in the lead! and the biggest player of Teresa is down... Super comeback. 12-17 Is this a first for the Dignity tournament? Yes! Manav and team will have to do something. And... A full on attack! - Rohan is down! - Come on Rohan! Rohan! - That's a foul. - Let go. This is absolute rough play! I'm sure it's an injury. This isn't just rough play... This is borderline offensive. But it's the referee's call. I hope its nothing serious. I think it's a shoulder ligament tear. Boss! Bad news! If Rohan is injured then the team is in deep trouble. Someone get the doctor. Manav gets away with only a warning and a green card. But the damage is done. And now... Teresa is out to get them. They're making up for the lost points. Score 23-17 Rough play... Pishori players could never handle that! One after the other they are all out. Turn around for Teresa! Seems like Teresa is punishing Pishori. Point after point. 43-17. Huge margin. And this is the last raid of the first half. Pishori'a last man standing! The petrified Darwin. Teresa is a very experienced team. They changed their game quite spontaneously. And... Ankle hold... and Darwin down! This was almost like a wrestling move. Offensive play! This is just not allowed. Referee has given a strict warning. Teresa has not just thrown Darwin... ...but the entire Pishori team out of the game. And it's the end of the first half. 44-17. He won't be able to play now. And Rohan your shoulder is injured too. Well... Never mind. This year looks difficult... ...but we'll try again next year. Come on boys... Go! What? Inspite of the injury Rohan will continue playing. Amazing! It's an open challenge to Teresa. But it's a 27 point lead and they're left with just 20 minutes. What... An attack on Rohan and... AMAZING MOVE! 1 point. Yes! Rohan put himself up as bait and scored a point! 44-18 Next comes in the injured Tiger. Holding his shoulder... enters Rohan. We got him. One, Two... THREE! Three touch! Three point! Three Players out! And three players in! And the score is 44-21. But they still have a long way to go... Teresa is still in a majority lead. Teresa has taken such a big lead that even if Pisori tries... They won't be able to get there. Oh God! Rohan has managed to break Manav's magic move. And for the first time in the tournament Manav loses a point. Big moment for Pishori! But still just one point. They're only halfway there. Score 44-22. Only 10 minutes left... Literally fighting against time... Look at them go! SUPERB! 44-25. Pishori is fighting to make every second count. 44-30. Only five minutes left. Score 44-40. 30 seconds. And Pishori almost done for. They're still falling short of 4 points... and there is just enough time for one last raid by Teresa. Pishori is as good as out. They have a very slim chance of staying in the game. And for that, they'll have to take Manav out in under thirty seconds. And even if Manav dosen't tap a player, Teresa will still win by 4 points. Manav Randhawa... almost holding the Student trophy. Just wasting time in the raid. 10 seconds. And toe Touch... side flip... and DIVE! Teresa! 47- 40. Pishori could not take Manav out. Instead Manav scored three points by tapping 3 players. Comfortable win! Teresa is the champion again! And the Student of the Year 2019 is— Hold on. The result hasn't been declared yet. Referees are discussing... Apparently they think Manav completed his raid in twenty nine seconds. If that's the case then Pishori will get one more raid. One last opportunity! And that's a new twist! 1 second! Manav came back 1 second too soon and Pishori gets a final raid. Manav has to pay the price for being over confident. Manav's miscalculation has given Pishori a new fighting chance. 47- 40. Which means Pishori needs eight points to win. And that's only possible if Rohan gets an all out. Seven points plus two bonus points. Son... not everyday one get's an opportunity like this one. Do or die! Pishori's hope is now set on this one boy! 8 points... 8 points to win. And one...two... three... four... five... six... and that's a seven! Not student... Loser of the Year. The day was yours... But I'll seize the year! And he's done it. Rohan Sachdev crosses the line! Pishori has WON! Final score 47- 49. HISTORY IS MADE! The best team of the competition is - Teresa! Two time defending champions - Teresa! The best player - from Teresa! And everything in this competition was about Teresa and only Teresa. But these underdogs have defeated Teresa and won the DIGNITY CUP! What a game! What a FINISH! We did it. I love you duffer. Ladies and gentlemen... For the first time in the entire history of the Dignity cup... the winner is Pishorilal Chamandas College! Cheers to Pishorilal! And now... The winner of the Student of Year for the year 2019 is... ROHAN SACHDEV! Bro, you did it. Student of the Year! In life, pick your own dreams... ...and go after them. So that one day when it turns to reality, you're the first one to notice.
