The time is now 5.40 AM, means the day is yet to start. But, Jakarta listeners, No harm... ...in getting up early. to get ready for a better day than yesterday. Those going to school. Or going to work, please be well prepared. Here’s a song for you, Jakarta listeners A sweet song about our hectic Jakarta. Somebody’s still sleepy, I see. She said she was hungry. What are those noises in her stomach? Maybe she skipped breakfast. Where’s the food? Are you sleep talking? Wait a moment. Don’t forget to charge your mobile phone. I’ll let you know when I’m free to go out. Around 10am, I’m running lunch errands for people at the office. I’ve prepared everything. Don’t forget your diploma. Get it in your bag now. You’ll embarrass me if you forget that. Yes, Anas. I’ve prepared everything. Stop nagging! Morning. Morning. Smells good. Morning. Morning, honey. Have a bite. Yummy!/ Honey, tonight… I’ll make you dinner, okay? What’s the occasion? Just don’t eat out. Eva, honey. You have music lesson today, right? Yes. Good girl. Honey, Asrul just got promoted. Really? Yes, finally. / Tell me more. Gosh, I’m running late. I’ll tell you later. Come, Eva. Bye, Mommy. Here’s your lunch. Oh yes, I forgot. Bye, take care. Sinta, have a seat. I need to talk to you. I understand that you just got promoted. But this concerns the marriage proposal. I have to maintain a good relationship with Firman’s family Exactly, Dad. I want to focus on my work. I’m not trying to delay the wedding. Not at all. I just want everything to be thought through. Remember what Mom used to say to me? A woman has to be independent... and have a good job. That’s all I want. I’ll wait in the car. Thank you, Mom. For ironing my shirt. What’s wrong, Mom? Be patient with your brother. He’s still not over his screen printing business closing down. Yes, Mom. I understand. That’s what brothers are for. We have to help each other. Besides… It kills me to see him depressed like that. I’m going. All right, take care. Peace be unto you. And unto you I just don’t want to end up like Mom. Hello again, my Jakarta friends. It’s a little past 7AM now. Jakarta traffic must be bad. Although you’re running late… Please be mindful of the street signs. You don’t want to get a ticket. Excuse me, which way is Old Town? Straight ahead, then make a left. Just make a left there? Yes, at the traffic light. Thank you. Dad, I want to draw you. Really? Why? If I miss you, I just have to look at it. Smart girl. You must want something from me. No, dad. Dad. For me? Yes. So pretty. Can I open it? No. You can read it when you get home. Thank you. I’ll put it here. Yes. Finished your drawing? / Not yet. Satay, please. / Thank you Yes, I’m in Thamrin already. Finishing my presentation. I tried to beat the traffic. Cruising for white guys. Don’t be ridiculous. No white guys in sight, anyway. Oh, there’s one. Just passed me by. But he’s old. I know. The meeting will starts at 12.00 PM What’s wrong, Mom? Look at you looking sharp. So handsome. You know me, Mom. I hate dressing up. That’s why I want to run my own business. I don’t like working for other people. Don’t be like that. You’ve been jobless for 7 months now. Don’t you feel sorry for your little brother? He’s been supporting us both. Anas had a point, though. I’m also tired of changing businesses. That’s why. Please pray for me so I get this job. So you don’t have to work anymore. It’s bad for your blood pressure. How is it? Good? It’s too salty. Really? Here, drink some water. Hold on. Here. Enough. I’m going. / Okay. “For Dad” Yes, Commander. Yes. Heading to headquarters for briefing. Yes, sir! On my way. Hello again! You’re still with Vincent. It’s Thursday, so I’m going to play some old songs for you. And at 10.40 AM… It’s quiz time! I’ve some cool giveaways./ I’m stuck in traffic. For those stuck in traffic, a song for you. Idiot! What’s the rush? Is someone chasing you? Freaking poor people. Sir, wear your helmet Morning, sir, ma’am./ Morning, sir. Can you pull over?/ All right. Just give him a ticket./ We’re so screwed. Stop./ Yes, sir. License and registration please?/ What did we do? You must wear helmets, while riding a motorbike sir. Let me take a look./ Please don’t give us ticket. We’re friends with the Chief of Police, you know. Yes, ma’am. I know, Anas. I’ve prepared everything. Sorry for troubling you. Where are you? I’m in front of the building. Everything is under control here. Over! Why so serious? Thank you. So when’s your wedding? Why haven’t I gotten the invitation? Hello, Mom. I’ve transferred the money. For the electricity bill and my sister’s school fee. It’s not much, but it’ll do. How’s everyone doing? Okay then. I have to work now. Morning. / Morning. Stop looking at yourself. Just trying to look sharp. Sharp? You’ll break the mirror. And let me tell you. Mirrors are made to see reflections so you can recognize your wrongs. Morning. / Morning. So you can make introspection. Your face is not cut out for mirrors. Are we still on the same mess? Right? So typical. What’s the fuss? Is it your girlfriend again? Same old story./ This woman thing has been dragging on forever. Kids nowadays. They’re taking it slow but not so sure. What kind of motivation is that?/ It’s not that, Rahmat. Seriously... You’re calling off the wedding? Not so loud, please. People will start talking. I haven’t made any decision. Oh God. All good with the in-laws. The bride is the problem now. That is not the situation. Our families have met./ Good, right? We’ve set the date./ Great. We’ve sent out the invitations. But I’m getting transferred to the border. Where is he getting transferred to? To Sangihe. In Sulawesi. Singihe?/ Sangihe. A small island on the border of the Philippines. So you’re going with him? But you just got promoted. Do they have malls there? Is it remote? A police officer has to be firm. If you’re a softie, your family will go down with you. The government is responsible for us. All good. The police force is like a 3-in-1 package. 3-in-1? It’s our identity. Our income source. And our insurance. You mean, like this?/ Where? So you have it. But don't understand it. Your future father-in-law is a police retiree, right? So his daughter understands you’ll get moved around. I don’t know what to do. I’ve avoided him for almost 2 weeks now. And… She’s not answering my calls. Or my texts. Do you have enough phone credits? Give him some quota. It’s messed up./ Just like your head. Don’t touch my hair. I’m trying to look sharp. You’ll end up single for life. Don’t say that. Can’t you just wish me well? Amen. But thank you for the advice. Now let’s get to work Many people run the red light at this hour. Stand by there. Just me? No, with your in-law. Fine, I’ll do it. Don’t forget your ticket book. Yes I’ll see you. Look sharp. Smile. Like this?/ There you go. Morning, Miss./ Morning. You just ran the red light. License and registration, please. Could you step out of the car? Here. I have all my papers. I did nothing wrong. You can’t turn left when the light is red. Since when? Turning left is always direct. I drive through here all the time. Never a problem. It has always been the rule, Miss So annoying. I also saw you were on your phone. You can’t do that while driving. And you need to turn down your radio volume. Now the radio is an issue, too? Don’t tell me what to do. Besides, I was using my phone responsibly. Please come with me to my post. Why should I? I did nothing wrong. Why should I go with you? I have an important meeting. In 5 minutes. You’re making me late. You want to take me to court? Do it here. Or tell me. How much do I owe you? It doesn’t work like that. We have procedures. Just tell me. How much do you usually get? Come with me to my post. Here. This should be more than enough.

Could you please take care of this? Why me? You deal with the paperwork. I was dealing with it. But she’s being so difficult. Dim, I’m being fined. I did nothing wrong, though. See, she’s always like that. I’ve explained to her what she did. But she just kept talking. No wonder your girlfriend trouble goes on and on. You’re such a wuss around women. Don’t say that./ Let me take a look. What did she do?/ She ran a red light. Okay then./ Okay?/ Yeah. Miss, please get off the phone. Step over here. He told me to hang up.

Have a seat, Miss. Let me prepare your ticket. Have a seat. I’ll be outside./ Okay. You seem to be in a rush. Very. I have a meeting. So much so that you ran a red light. I didn’t run a red light.
