All right. All right, you two. You need to get a room. La la la la la la. To the fucking new year! Woo! Whoa! Yeah bitches! Woo! Yeah I mean, she was here. Chrissy brought her. Why would she say that about you? I mean, I don't know why. How do you know Chris. Barely even know the guy. I mean, like not to be a dick, but he's kind of a loser. Pay him to walk Duke. So you invited him to the party then? Yeah. -I mean, I didn't not invite him -Randall. Do I need to make a phone call? No, no, absolutely not. This is bullshit. Total fucking bullshit. Okay. What's this? That's the chick Chris brought t I know, but why are we looking a Because she said you sexually as All three of you. That's crazy. Are you fucking kidding me? So none of you had sex with her in your bedroom on Saturday. Absolutely. fucking not. Oh, in my bedroom. So you don't know. Duke chewed the toilet hose upstairs before I left. So it was leakin' the whole time I was in the city. Fucking annoying, but I mean, This room has been closed off since last Wednesday. And of course, you got documentation for that? Of course. I'll let them search before they get their warrant. It looks better for you. Go down to the precinct. Answer all their questions. Unless I advise you gentlemen. otherwise. There's one other thing. We're going to need to volunteer No, no, we're not doing that. -I'm not doing that. -Fuck that. I don't want them to have my DNA so that they can pin some other We volunteer the DNA. They test it against any DNA they find on her or her clothes. If you don't match, you're clear and they can't run it anywhere else. Make sure? You gentleman have to trust me. Been doing this 25 years. Okay. Come on. Come on. How long I know you. I know. Alright let's go. So we move forward with Gonzales We agree? -Agreed? -Yes. Okay, then. Alicia Powers claimed she was raped by multiple men at a New Year's Eve party. Horrible if it happened. Looks like the evidence isn't there This Randall Larsen, though, is not exactly pristine. He's got previous accusations, r He was accused once before and the girl disappeared. No victim, no case. Anyway, the family's fucking loaded Easy target. Well, you all know Clay Portis, Well, he represents the Lawson family. He volunteered the boy's DNA, and there were no matches. How about witnesses? No witnesses. I mean, the only thing we do know from her medical report is that she had sex with someone and there was benzo in her syste Sounds like a party. What about this vaginal trauma? That can happen during consensual sex. All depends. Can I look into this? I'd like to talk to her. And Detective Miller and the three suspects. There are no suspects. Look, this girl has a history. Right now, we just don't have enough to take this case on. Unless something else comes forward We table it. Can we just hold on a second, pl So you're willing to sweep Randall's past under the rug, but because Alisha has a history she's not credible? No, I just mean she's damaged. Who knows what kind of horrible she's suffered through in her life But it's not in this file. Why would she make this up? The age old. Question. Well, maybe you'd like to charge with false reporting, then. If you're so sure. Gillian, you have until the end If you find nothing of substance Are we all on the same page? -Yep. -Okay then. Hey, have you worked with Miller before? -No. -Well, just so you know, he closed this case due to lack of evidence. Don't worry, Laura. I'll be more curious and critical Always believe the victim. Right? Hi, girl. Hi, boy. Hey. New case? Yeah. They are pretty men. Let me guess. Are they bikers? Mm hmm. Uh, did you imagine being raised by these guys, thou I don't know. Might be kind of cool. Yeah, not so much. Looks like when her mom OD'd, they just kind of moved in. And what about Dad? No, Dad. These guys pose as her uncles, but that was total fiction. I guess the mom's life insurance policy was decent, so they were set up. I don't know. I mean that does sound kind of a Well, I haven't gotten to the bruises. The bruises? Yeah. Apparently, she was battered. Showed up to school all banged u CPS came by a few times, but, you know. And that's why they're serving t No. Armed robbery when she was 18. Just about to start college. Just wish there was more to go o At this rate she's talking about. Jeez Jillian. Can you ever take an easy one? Umm no, no. No, no. And that's -why you are loved by me. -Ooh. Go get em, babe. And uh, dinner in 45. Okay. It's nice to meet you, Alicia. Thank you for coming in. Thank you for taking the case. I should probably clarify upfront This case was dead. I asked to keep it open, but I've got a week -and a half max to show. -Why? They said there's no evidence. That's true. As of yet. There is no evidence. Why am I here? Alicia, how are you doing? Tired. I read in your file that a Chris Massey invited you to the party. What's your relationship to him? Why? I'm just trying to understand the circumstances what happened to you that night. Um, we were together. And now? We're not. I just want to be alone. How did you two meet? Uh, we were together in high school. That's a really long time. Must have been a special relationship I guess so. We haven't been together this whole time. We just recently reconnected. -How? -Through my dog. He works for the animal hospital Checking in? She's can just step up on here. It's been a minute. Yeah. Yeah, it has. You got a pup. He started walking her when I was at work a couple of years ago. -What's her name? -Norma. And um one thing led to another. And how is Chris connected to Randall? He also walks his dog. I think that Chris thinks that they're friends, but. Now's not really good time. He's really just friends with Ra Hey, hey. Take it easy. Take it easy. There you go. And how were things with Chris? Great. I loved him. So anything else you want to ask me? I'm so open to helping. No, that's. That's really great. For now. Okay. Thank you so much for coming in. Yeah. Thank you so much. Thanks. Alicia? There's a really good support group at the church down the street. Thanks. I've been going for a while now. Nice to meet you too, Detective. So you think you see something I didn''''t. I actually don't know what I see I'd like to see it from your angle. From every angle. How long have you been doing this Let's not go there, Detective. It's a waste of time. A waste of time. Hello? Clay Portis? -Yes. -Jillian Drisbane. Nice to meet you. Detective. Miss Drisbane that's Mr. Lawson. Thank you for having us. -My pleasure. -Detective Miller. Yeah, we've met. Very nice. Lucky guy. Your parents let you live here on your own? His parents have many homes right on the Amalfi coast. Randall helps run the business, takes care of the What can I say? Good son. Why don't we take a look at the Yes, please. Here's where she claimed it happy Room was under construction. And uh, we provided tons of paperwork and pictures to corroborate So, if there's nothing else. Clay, come on. These people have a job to do, Didn't we do this a while back at the station? Portis. -We have some paperwork to look -Just a second. You going to be all right? I'll take care of this with Mill You sure? You like it? The painting? No. The bed. Who's the artist? Oh, fuck if I know. The graduation gift from my father. He says it's going to appreciate but I have my doubts. Truth is, he's probably just keeping it here So my mother doesn't see it. She can't know that he's accepting gifts from his gallery owner lady friends Tell me about your parties. They're a blast. You should come check them out. Hell, bring your client. Alicia Powers is not my client. She's a witness. Witness? C'mon a witness to what? I'm not really one to bad mouth people, but. That chick's got issues. I probably turned her down at on and now she's gotten a little. You sound resentful. I mean, this kind of thing happens all the time. Guy turns down a girl. She finds a way to get back at h Am I right? Look, I'm sure you're probably imagining this party to be some type of Animal House re-enactment, but that's just speculation. So, seriously, you should come and check it out for yourself. You know what, Randall? If you have something worth list to, give me a call. It's good to see you. Thank you. He's an arrogant little prick. Randall? That's putting it politely But it doesn't make him guilty. You think she's lying? It doesn't matter what I think. I think he's hiding something. Show me the evidence. Until then, it was nice meeting you. Hi, Alicia. Hey What's up? I'm just on my way to work. Do you mind that I dropped in? No, not at all. This place smells so good. I know. So I've been looking at the file Do you think they've done this b Yeah, absolutely. Okay. Do you have any names? No, I can't. It's confidential. Of course, but the stories. They're similar. Yes, practically identical. Blackout. Wake up at some random location stop train station. -I heard it like, 15 times. -15? Well, not literally 15 I'm- I mean like, seven. Always multiple guys. Does anybody remember any detail Anything about the room, the bed I don't know. In your statement, you said there was a poster on t Yeah, yeah, it's a hockey player Any artwork? Alicia, I need that special order What's taking you so long? Okay, I got it. Um, I just. -I need a minute, sorry. -Yeah. We can talk about this -another time, okay? -Okay. Thank you. Is everything okay? Who was that? Um, I'm fine. It's fine. All right. So how rich is he? Filthy rich. That settles it. Guillotine. Straight off, he's done. I'm just saying, he has the money to buy the best lawyers. He can just pay these girls off. Beat it every time. No secret settlement for your gal No secret. Anything for her. It's all out there. There's definitely something authentic about her. Maybe. Maybe she's after something bigger. Okay, look, let's um let's just play devil's advocate here for a minute. Picture yourself losing this case What do you say to this girl? Babe? This isn't about Lola, is it? No. Okay. Okay. -Can you grab the wine please? -Yep. Mm hmm. Randall Lawson is an arrogant piece of shit who's never done an honest day's work in his life. But all that aside, you cannot lay an assault charge, a rape charge on someone based on supposition. I've been down this street before It just won't stick. How does he fit into this whole thing Chris hi. I'm Jillian Drisbane from the prosecutor's office. I believe you've spoken with Detective Miller before Yeah, we've met before. Thanks for coming. Would you like a cup of coffee? Sure. Excuse me. Coffee? You were at Randall Lawson's New Eve party. Yeah. With Alicia Powers? Yeah, I brought her there. And you left without her? Yeah, I just. I felt like going home that nigh And she wanted to stay out. Never knew that. Can you tell us about your relationship with Ali Does that have to do with anything Well, if we want to open this ca against Randall and use Alicia as a witness, I need to know that she's a credible witness. Credible? Alicia's the realest person I kn Of course. But the more I know, the more I can help. Okay what do you want to know? So you met in high school? Yeah. Senior year. I was pretty unhappy back then. I just kind of numb all the time Before I met Alicia, I just wanted to disappear. -Disappear? -I don't know. I just didn't really have any friends. Really talk to anyone. Alicia was nice to you. She didn't know I existed. Not to sound creepy, but I. I kind of watched her from a distance all the time, and then one day, I was driving home from school, and I saw her walking by herself on the side of the road And I just pulled over and asked her if she wanted a ride. And after that, my life changed. Changed how? I don't know. I just. I felt something. I laughed. For the first time in years. Alicia has a way of really seeing you. I loved having someone to take care of. Felt good. That sounds really great. Was while it lasted What happened? -We broke up. -Why? I don't know. She just started her first semester of college. She seemed really happy. Alicia? Her uncles had gone to jail But she was going out meeting new people. I don't know what happened. I couldn't reach her. I just. I figured she didn't need me anymore. I know you and Alicia got back together recently, so can you tell me how she was doing She was great. It was like nothing had changed. She was that same amazing person Just like in the beginning. It's like we just started where we left off. I didn't really want to talk about it neither did she. So why did you guys break up this time? Are we broken up? I don't know. Ask her that. She won't answer my calls. I don't know what I did. You left her at the party, didn't you? So how do you feel about that decision now? The fuck do you think I feel about that decision? Makes me sick. Do you have any other questions? Not me. Thanks for the coffee. So you learn anything? I don't know. -Hi. -Hey. Any updates? Unfortunately not. Do you want this? Somebody literally didn't pick up their o and I hate to throw them away. Maybe your husband would appreciate them. Sure. Thank you. Hear Randall's freaking out. In like crazy fights at hockey and stuff. Oh. Where did you hear that? Just through the grapevine. Maybe the cracks are finally starting to form. Cracks? You know, he's just so protected His lawyers and lackeys, the whole thing. I just don't think he's been under this kind of pressure You really think he's -feeling pressured right now? -Yeah. -And I think if we keep pushing -You think he'll come clean? Alicia, I've got nothing. I had nothing when I started, and I still have nothing. So just going to give up? -No, but I just... -You don't wanna represent me. Represent you, Alicia. I need to remind you that I am not your attorney. This is about whether the state of Connecticut has enough on Randall Lawson to build a case. You're my witness. And right now, you're the only one I've got. Great. Hey. You think about what I said. Will they be able to trace it back No, no. I'll never use your name, I promise Serve them, right? Yeah. Hey, Jillian. -Hi. -Hey. How was your weekend? I've got some stuff you might like -What's this? -Statements. from two other victims. Whitney Higgs? Yeah, it's got to be. Alicia didn't give a name. Just Jane Doe one. Yeah. I partied and dropped off at Stanford Stat New Year's Eve. Well, couple of years back. Three. We didn't have a case. I mean, the medical report indicated severe vaginal trauma, but the statement was useless and said something like victim doesn't know when or where the rape took place, doesn't know assailant. I mean, the DNA was inconclusive Honestly, we think they use condoms But then what was it about maybe eight months later? Something like that yeah. Yeah, eight months later. She walks in here with a license plate number. Randall Lawson. But the defense would've torn it to shreds over her statement. And what you didn't fight for he It was eight months later, and we had no crime scene, no usable DNA. No case. So she filed a civil suit. Her lawyer got Randall's father to give her enough to pay for the rest of her college and then some. But because Randall didn't have to any wrongdoing, Whitney said no. See that right there? Says it all. It says a lot about her character but it doesn't change the facts. I mean, her mother had to beg her to take that deal before they pulled it and she signed an NDA. I mean, if they knew we had this she could lose the whole thing. I'm going to act like it doesn't even exist. Detective. Come on. All right, well, Jane Doe two. In her statement, she claims that he made her feel like she was responsible The thing is, there's just not much we can do with an anonymos number Oh, hold on. Halloween blond, white dress. What are you talking about? Years ago. Late at night, I'm sitting at my desk. Brunson is in the interview room berating this young lady. I don't miss that guy. He was a creep. Yeah, he had issues, but, I mean, everyone in the bullpen could hear it. Oh, I hear what you're saying. Halloween, party, etc.. What I don't understand is why d you go to the hospital? Did that ever occur to you to go to the fucking hospital? You're going to have to stop cry because I can't understand a word you're saying when you're Jesus Christ Almighty Stop crying, I. Hey, stop crying. I can't understand. May I ask you another question? How much have you had to drink t Going to answer that because you reek. You reek. You reek. Yeah. Brunson, call for you. Hey, I'm fucking working here. Step over here for a moment. What the hell? What is going on in there? Girl claims she was raped as she walked here from the train station. Have you fucking seen her. You smelled her? See the dress She's wearing with tits hanging See all the way down to her goddamn naval which is calling it like I see it -No, no, no. -Hands off of me. You go home right now. I'm taking this one. You're taking this one? All yours. Young lady I'd like to apologize for- No. I drove around for hours. I couldn't find her. That was the Saturday before Halloween. One of Randall's parties. Come on. You can't deny how it looks Jane Doe two huh. You'd think that maybe she would come in. You know, I mean, bottom line, I'd like to apologize for the way we handled it. Doesn't matter. This was six years ago. That's not good enough. I mean, do you have any idea how many women work up the courage to speak up just to find out that it's too late Yes, I know. I think we can all agree that the five year statute of limitations is fucked But listen, it's the law. We have no choice. Sorry. -Baby. -Mm. I really think. You're dodging a bullet here. -I failed her. -No. No, you didn't. You went above and beyond for he It's- It's pretty amazing. Really. Selfishly, I'm kind of glad it's over. Not winning is kind of like losing. I don't know how it's done. You just move on. Well, here's to moving on. But I don't like it. To moving on. -I just. -Yes? Why don't you believe her? All right. You read Jane Doe two's letter? Yeah, I know it. Front to back. Well, Alicia statement's almost identical to it. Exactly. Because it's the same guys that keep getting away with it, It's the savior complex. I'm sorry. The Savior complex. She's been going to these assault survivor groups diligently doing her homework. She's absolutely convinced that it's Randall, behind all these assaults so she gets to his party, says that she's been raped, she makes a false assault charge, you know, and she saves the day Jane Doe one, two and three and as she believes Randall and Company have been assaulting. She single handedly brings down that group of men. She is the savior. That's not it. She says she was raped in this bedroom that you and I both know was under contruction And she never mentioned any of this It could have been a different bedroom But Alicia says it was that bedroom Right. She says it was a poster of a hockey player on the wall. Did you see a poster of a hockey I saw this abstract painting that looked like roadkill. But you know who did mention a poster of a hockey player during the assault? Jane Doe two. Exactly. On the left. Anything new or. I don't know. Is there anything new? All right. Did you help Whitney Higgs -identify Randall Lawson? -No. She went to the police way before I heard her story. Right. She didn't start speaking up at group until like six months ago. Six months ago? Not to be insensitive. What the hell were you doing in group therapy six months ago? It's not group therapy. It's a support group for trauma And what were you doing there? What if I'm ready to speak out n I know they're still doing it. I'm not the only one. I don't have parents. Think you've seen my file. When you came to from this alleged assault, did you notice any plastic sheet plumbing, any drywall? Alicia, your description is years old. It's something you heard someone else say. Someone else's memory. You can't describe the room accurately because you were never in-- I was in there. Three men, but no semen, no sweat, no skin, no hair, nothing. We cannot charge three men for something you think they might have done to other women Do you understand? Making false statements won't make you a hero Can I go? Yeah. Yeah. Get outta here. There's something else. Hi. Scott. Shit. Matt, I'm so sorry, I. I totally spaced. Actually, you know what? I don't think I'm going to make it No, no. I'll just leave it out for me. I'll be back before it's cold. Okay. I'm sorry. I'll see you. Bye thank you. You need me to leave? You're good. Another 15 minutes. Are you Whitney? Do I know you? I'm with the state attorney's office. I'm working on a case totally unrelated. I came across a lawsuit you filed a while back. She said she wouldn't use my name She didn't. Can I ask you a few questions? Shit. Thank you. You know I can't talk, right? This is off the record. Not that I don't regret it with but I signed the freaking papers I understand. Is this going to trial? The case is dead. This is just a little due diligence before I put it to bed. You're pretty sure the guys who assaulted you are the same ones who attack Yeah. What about the other Jane Doe? Her too. Any others? I'm sure. How can you be so sure? The details. The fancy house. Two friends just show up, whole being dumped at a train station like a bag of garbage. Can you tell me how you found him Eight months later? I'm eating dinner in a restaurant and I look over at the bar and I see him. I couldn't believe it. I only met him once, but I could never forget that face. I followed him outside and got his license plate. Did you already know Alicia at that point? Only through the group. She wasn't there all the time, and we. We weren't close or anything, just a hello type of thing. Did you two ever talk about Randall? I don't know. Is it possible that Alicia gave you Randall's license plate number? Are you serious? Do you not think it's at all bizarre that she claims to have been raped by the same men It's not bizarre. It's all too common. It's fucking tragic. I didn't mean to imply. I'm implying that we're closed now and you need to leave. Okay. Okay. She wanted to go to college out of state, but there was no money for that. So we heard about this poker game 200 guys, 100 bucks a head. So we thought. I would cover some tuition, at least for a semester or two. Right? Yeah. Fucking stupid. Big biker dudes were way too easy to spot. We fucked up a good thing. What kind of a good thing? Family. I'm not saying that it was traditional, We had a family. When Alicia's mom OD'd, nobody came forward. No aunts, no grandparents, nobody. I went through foster care. So did Tiny. You don't wish that on a four-year old Your sentence. You said you were unarmed. Did you appeal? Nah. Alicia had already spent too much money on our legal fees. Alicia paid your legal fees. That was her call. Once she makes a decision, she's. Unstoppable. -Hi. -Hi. I hope I'm not interrupting. No. Do you wanna come in? -Sure. -Come in. You've not met Norma. -Hi Norma. -Norma Jean. Hi. I have to apologize to you, Alicia. For what? I was mistaken about you. I met Jack, and I clearly made a very wrong assumption about your childhood. It's okay, so did Child Protective Services. They just love putting people in boxes, you know Mine's labeled troubled child. I hate even bringing it up, but I've been thinking a lot about Whitney and umm you know, I would. I would understand if you were looking for a settlement from Randall. I know it sounds awful, and um I just. I mean, I. I just want you to know that I understand that you're all hurting for money I really think you can't even see what you're doing. I don't need your pity. Of course not. No, you're right. I'm completely out of line. I'm very sorry. I should go. Jillian. Please stay. Okay. Cheers. Cheers. Your ring? Oh, yeah um. Matt picked it out. Really? I pegged you for someone to pick it out yourself. Oh um, it didn't really matter to me I just needed to marry him. I wanted. I wanted to. Drink to that. Yes. Oh no. I finish what I start. You know? Woo! I should go. Yeah. I'm just. Yeah. What is that? Jack Did it. Oh, Jack. He tries No, it's my mom and I. -Aw. -Yeah. I'll show you a real picture. Okay. Don't go anywhere. Don't you dare. Right here. This is a bit more accurate than... than that. You look just like her. She used to make a joke like... Like she me all by herself. Oh, so that I. When she passed I didn't even. I didn't think it was permanent, you know? Didn't think she was actually gone Yeah. Sorry. It's fine. I mean, it's. It's not fine, you but I miss her. It would have been nice having her around, you know, going through all this stuff with Randall. Sometimes you just want your Mom I'm sorry. I'm a mess. I don't know how you do this. Do what? You're just, like, perfect. No. You know you were right people love to put other people into boxes. Well, hey, if you're not so perfect what's your big, dark secret? Well, I did marry my dead best friend's brother so. -Oh. -Wow. I've never said that before. Like um. Like that. What happened? Um someone... really hurt her when we were in high school, and I, she never told me about it when it happened. She lived with it for a long time by herself and then she never got help and six years ago, her brother, Matt, found her. And then we got married. You needed each other. Hello? Police Ms. Powers. Detective Rodriguez. Ms. Powers. Alicia, do you mind if I call yo What's going on? Bobby Crawford was found murdered Was shot point blank. They can't possibly think she did it You don't know yet. You're absolutely sure you were -home last night? -Positive. When did it happen? I'd like to know. According to the neighbors, 911 sometime between 9:30 and 9:40 l My take? 9:30? How do you feel about it? Yeah. One less rapist in the world. She says she was at home, but so far, no one can confirm t No neighbors, no friends. I can. He was killed with a .32 caliber You know anything about firearms I don't even know what a .32 caliber is. If we had known that you had somebody to corroborate your whereabouts, we never would've put you through this I apologize. Waste of fucking time. Let him sit in there, sweat for You didn't tell me you were look You can't be in here. Chris was in touch with Bobby over the last few days. We think he might know something I think I should be here. No, it's not appropriate. She might be able to help. Okay, fine. I'm going. Hey Chris. Good to see you again. Thanks for coming in. We've got a couple of questions we wanna ask you. It's a real shame what happened to Bob Crawford, h You guys were friends, right? I mean, we knew each other. You know, you knew each other we for you to call him last night, right? I mean, on our records here we h calling both Bobby and Randall last night. Well isnt it so Now we'd be real interested what you had to say with these two gentlemen. You think you could share that with us? Come on Chris. I didn't think he'd take it this far. He's pissed at me. You did something to piss somebody off huh He's afraid I'm gonna- Afraid you're gonna do what? It's bad. Okay. What's bad? The prescription I- Prescription? The benzo for Duke. Who the hell is Duke? Randall's dog. He's a Doberman. He had a prescription from my clinic and I. Thank you, Chrissy. I'll see you next week. So now you're a veterinarian? Yeah. I'm a vet assistant. You forge a prescription. I didn't forge anything. He just ran out, and I needed. I just wanted to make sure Duke was okay. Fuck you. Alicia? Stay. Is Alicia here? You need to protect her. Protect her how? Why does his dog need benzodiazepine, huh? Wanna tell me that? Duke has a history of aggressive He needs to be medicated when he I just. You called Randall last night. What'd you tell him? I told him I was done with the benzo. Done huh? You think maybe Randall killed B Hmm? You think maybe Randall's been u these benzos that you gave him to rape women? What do you think, Chris? Just answer the fucking question Am I under arrest? You think Chris was trying to warn Bobby? Why set them up. Bobby knew enough to get himself Why not just kill Alicia? She's the one who knows who's talking Well, it doesn't seem to make any difference what Alicia says We got to get into Lawson's house You think we got enough for a search warrant We got a body. We got a witness. It gives a motive. What the hell else do we need? I'm on it. What about Chris? Says he doesn't know anything. We got nothing to hold them on. Hold him, please. It's just so obvious that he's involved I feel so much safer. Hey Rod. Gentlemen, go. Hold on a second. You want to get out here, maybe tail somebody, I'm going to go. -I'll call you later. -Yeah. You okay? Yeah. I just can't believe he was involved So what do we got? Not much basically drove past Alicia's job. Just kind of slowed down and didn't get out of the car. I went to visit his work, you know, that clinic. Bet his boss gave him a few choice words. Went to the Matrix. Played pool for a couple hours. -Really? -Yeah. And I followed him here. Been here for a little bit. All right, I'm going to go in. I'll take it from here. Anything happens I'll text ya. Yeah. What do you got? When? Enough. Let's go. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh. Hey.
