I think I'll have dozens of lanterns floating on the water. Aglow under the moonlight. And the tall trees along the banks will be swaying in the wind. Like the Tenryuji Garden. Dad took us to. Remember? The longawaited federal court appointment of Judge Teoh Yun Ling appears to be hanging by a thread after troubling allegations of a relationship with former Imperial gardener. Nakamura Aritomo now a suspected Japanese spy... Yun Ling. You look wonderful. You haven't changed a bit. Liar. No, it's true. Oh, Frederick... Adam's studying medicine in London. Natalie's heir to the throne. She took over foreign sales a few years back and it's our biggest business now. That's Anne. It will be 25 years next month. 25 years... Did you manage to go through all your father's things? Yes, right. Well, more piles than files. I found something. I think the photograph was taken at the time they signed the rental agreement. The allegations, have they provided even a shred of evidence? It's not a legal argument, it's political. All the opposition needs to do is accuse him of being a spy and just one rumour can keep me off the seat. But every Japanese in Malaysia was called a spy at one time or another. Yes, but the people close to them don't get appointed to the federal court. Is that Ah Cheong? Yes. He's worked for me for... Well, ever since Aritomo. That's very kind of you. Is any of this at all useful? I mean, it puts him here long before the war and after. Have you been down to the house? No, I was waiting for you. And everything kept the way it was? As far as I know. I don't remember this being here. No, it used to hang over there but we moved it after the incident. Right. There's definitely nothing in it, right? What do you mean? The allegations against Aritomo. I mean, you were working for the War Crimes Tribunal. If he'd been any kind of a spy then you of all people would have known. Kobayashi Mamuro. Ten minutes. You had a lot to say. I accept my fate. But my son can't go on with his life thinking his father's a monster. On your honour promise me you'll mail this personally without censor. If you tell me what you know. From what I hear the camp you're looking for it wasn't like the others. Not just prisoners who were blindfolded to go there. Guards, too. The guards were blindfolded? Once in a convent. I heard a man refer to it as kin no yuri. Golden Lily. Yes, I know the name. But do you have any idea where the camp is? No. Or what it was for? Is this really all you have for me? You're the highestranking prisoner left. Yun Hong! Two days ago, on the 25th of March an attack took place by the Semur River in Gua Musang, Kelantan. 17 soldiers of the Malay Regiment were killed by communist terrorists and eight soldiers wounded in the battle... For my garden I want at least five pine trees. But we might not have pine trees here. How can you still love. Japanese gardens after what the Japs have done to us? It's their gardens I like not them. It's my garden. It's something I love. They've taken everything from me. I won't let them have this too. Never. Ladies and gentlemen it's just a routine inspection. But I will need some of you to get off the bus. What are you doing in. Cameron Highlands? We live here. Just ignore it. Ma'am? Do I look like a communist to you? I'm afraid so. What are these? Not what you think. Charles. Magnus. I know this girl. I can vouch for her. Lieutenant Smith. She's all right, let her go. I kind of thought you'd run into trouble back there. It's a heck of a time to visit, poppet. The communist jungle warfare is intensifying by the day. I can't imagine your father's too pleased with your being here. At least he asked me to say hi for him. Thank you again for arranging the meeting. Not a problem at all. It's set for nine tomorrow. I'd recommend getting there on time. I thought I knew my P's and Q's until I met Aritomo. I'm afraid it might have been a wasted trip. He's unlikely to go with you. You warned me already. My chateau. My wife, Emily. Hi. Yun Ling, welcome. Did you get carsick? I'm fine, Magnus is a good driver. Don't lie. I know too well how his driving is like. I'm right here, you know. Right, shall we settle her in? She wants to stay in the cottage. The cottage? We're not her kind of people. She'd rather take her chances with the communists. Are these people bothering you? Yun Ling, our son Frederick. From my previous marriage. Yun Ling, isn't it? Hello. My father said that you worked the Kobayashi trial. I remember reading about that. That and the atrocities. It's horrible. I helped gather evidence. I watched him hang for his crimes. They made you watch? No, they don't make us. She wants to stay in the cottage. Only for a few days. I hope it's not too much trouble. Not at all, we hardly ever use it. At least come for high tea this weekend. The whole of Cameron Highlands will be here. The wellheeled and even betteroiled. Magnus. If you could just point me the right way? Certainly. Ah Soon... I'll take it myself. I've got it. It's OK, I can take it. Thank you. I think I'll go for a Buddhist trinity stone arrangement with a karesansui (dry rock garden) right beside it. The raked sand will resemble waves giving the illusion of movement. You'll get what I mean when you see it for yourself. It's just sand and rocks. How magical can it be? Yun Hong. Yun Hong. I promise, one day you will have your own garden. I have something for you. I found it in the mine. It's probably just an ordinary stone. No, it's a diamond. You're right. It's a diamond. Yugiri (Evening Mists) Yun Ling? It's only 7.00am. I know. Remove your shoes. Wait here. World Map. Best of Luck in Battles. I am Nakamura Aritomo. Teoh Yun Ling. Magnus said you work for. War Crimes Tribunal. Not anymore. Is that why you agreed to see me? I agreed because Magnus asked. I read you were once the most decorated gardener in Japan. Decorated? No. But you used to work at the Imperial Palace. Yes. How can I help you? I have a piece of land in Kuala Lumpur. It was left by my grandmother. It's about six acres. I drew this from memory. I can explain them better. I'm not interested in a garden commission. Before the war my father took our family to Kyoto on vacation after losing our grandmother. My sister was depressed. Closed off for months. But when we walked into the Tenryuji Garden she was so moved tears started coming down her face. It was there that she fell in love with Japanese gardens. When we got home she read all the books she could find. Desperate to understand how they were created. You cannot learn gardening from books. Yes. Well... then the war broke out. She was taken, like so many others. We were marched, blindfolded to a labour camp deep in the jungle. In the camp, she found a way of coping. To create a garden in her mind. Piece by piece, day by day it kept her alive. She swore that one day, she would build her garden for real. But on the day your people surrendered the camp was destroyed. Everyone buried alive. My sister never made it out. I've spent the last six years looking for the camp to find her and bring her home. It's proven impossible. The only way I can honour her now is to build her garden. I am busy with Yugiri. It will take many months. OK, months. I can wait. You cannot even wait until 9.00am. I was woken at 4.30am every morning during the war. My body has never adjusted. That's why I came early. No. You came early to tell that story. Please. I can pay well. I'm sorry. I'm not interested in commission. Her name is Yun Hong. She was 19 when she was taken. To Kobayashi Masako. If it isn't bad enough that I have workers staying away and suppliers too scared to deliver. Elizabeth's now talking about moving in with her sister for a while. Are you sure that has anything to do with the terrorists, Paul? Excuse me, gentlemen. Magnus, Mr Tan and his mother are here. Thanks, Emily. Gentlemen. Wonderful. Have fun, eat cake. I heard about Aritomo. Sorry. I shouldn't have expected better. Is there anything I can do? How are your gardening skills? If you ask my tomato plant, not that good. If it were still alive. An ambush on Kuala Kubu Road just hours ago has claimed the life of Sir Henry Gurney. The High Commissioner has been assassinated. It is not immediately clear how the vacuum at the top of government will be filled but swift retaliation from British forces is expected. A nationwide curfew of 5pm is being enforced immediately. People are being advised to stay indoors and exercise caution. I found these last night. They are yours? I've thought about your offer. You have? Everything in my garden's going slowly. So if you wish, you can stay and work. I cannot leave Yugiri. But once we have finished you will know everything to create your sister's garden yourself. Good morning. Mahmood. I'm here, sir. Rizal. Yes, sir. Shashank. Yes, sir. Romesh. Yes, sir. Kannadasan. Yes, sir. Yun Ling. Yun Ling. Yun Ling. Missy? Yes. One! Two! Three! One! Two! Three! Come on! One! Two! Three! One! Two! Three! One! Two! Three! How long have you all been working here? Years, missy, years. Years? Boss keeps changing things. We finished and he'd change something. We're used to it. Changing what? All the stones. Continue. One! Two! Three! One! Two! Three! One! Two! Three! Mahmood! OK. One! Two! Three! One! Two! Three! First book on gardening, Sakuteiki calls garden design ishi o taten koto. The art of setting stones. That's how important it is. You must imagine them standing. The arrangement must feel... shizen. Natural. The army's moving the squatter settlements by the jungle into compounds. The Chinese settlements? They're only "squatting" because they had to abandon their homes to escape the Japs during the war. Apparently, some of them are supplying the terrorists with food medicine, information. Tiny slips of paper they roll up to the size of toothpicks and they hide them in the handle bars of bicycles. Never talk politics, right? My father thinks that the new. Chinese compounds are a cover. He thinks the army has found the Yamashita Gold. The what? The Yamashita Gold. It was an operation led by a man called Yamashita. There are people who say that he looted banks and depositories and whatnot. Hid it in the mountains to ship back after they won the war. Now they say when they lost the war that treasure never left the country. My father and others would spend every single Saturday looking for the treasure. It's a fantasy for old men. Mr Frederick, good morning. Good morning. Sorry, a lot of people here. You have to share the table. It's quite all right. Your girlfriend? No, she's not my girlfriend. Not yet? What do you know about Aritomo? Not much, he keeps himself to himself in the main. I heard that he left Japan because he was fired from the Imperial Palace. He was fired? Rumour has it that he refused to build a tennis court in the garden. Can't have been easy for him living here. I mean under the occupation. One! Two! Three! One! Two! Three! Missy! Missy! Pull! Hurry up, missy! Watch out, missy! Pull! One! Two! Three! Back up. Wrong place. What? Again? Do you even know where the right place is? Missy. When the stone tells me. You're enjoying this, aren't you? Watching us work like this for you! Everyone, take a break. Yun Ling. Come. Sit. I'm filthy. Sit. Now look. What do you see? Stones buried by a crazy person. Look again, without prejudice. We compose a picture in this frame. Taking the outside world into the garden gives us a larger canvas. It can show us solitude and beauty. Borrowed scenery. Shakkei, yes. The outside world is always there. The only control we have is choosing how we see it. Eat all the food you want. Take whatever you need. Are you Yun Ling? You tried war criminals for the British? I wasn't working for the British. I was working against the Japanese. Things are getting desperate after we killed Gurney. We're getting pushed deeper into the jungle. What is wrong with this world? First it was the Japs and now the Brits. Will we ever be... So pretty. Don't touch my photo! What the hell? I'm talking! We're starving but our commander still eats like a king. We never planned on killing Gurney. We just got lucky. But our commander got all the credit for it. What do you want from me? You know the Brits who are in power? I don't. Bloody hell! I know you do! Let me in! What's going on? Why did you come in? I told you to wait outside. I'm sorry, Yun Ling. He's my brother. Cheong! Pass a message to the Brits for me. I'll give them my commander but I want a bigger bounty. So much for patriotism. At the end of the day it's just about money. I will hurt you! Calm down! You think you scare me? I've been through worse! Kwai! This is not over. I'm sorry. To Nakamura Aritomo. I like what you did with the place. You think Ah Cheong's been keeping it up? Who else? Have you found anything useful? I found his passport. Only one entry, into Malaya. 1937. That's good. It means he never left. If he were a spy they would've gotten him home. They tried. What do you mean? I was there when this came. They requested him to go back but he declined. That's even better. A spy doesn't decline the request of their country. This room gets a good breeze at night. It's comfortable. Mr Aritomo was just a gardener. He was brusque but fair. He was kind to me. And I respect him a lot. Is that why you've kept his quarters clean? You're hoping he'd come back? He got lost in the jungle. Everyone knows that. Actually, a few years ago two nuns came looking for Mr Aritomo. Wait. Sit down. The two nuns said when they were younger they were taken to a convent in Tanah Rata by the Japanese. The convent was being used as a... A comfort station? What's worse was after the war ended they had nowhere to go. Their families were too ashamed of them to allow them home. That's how they became nuns. The irony of it. They were put through hell in a convent and yet, that's where they found salvation in the end. The two nuns came looking for Mr Aritomo to thank him. They said Mr Aritomo saved many young girls at the convent. Yun Ling, that's... If you can get these nuns to go on record you can show that. Aritomo worked against Japan. That would be enough. It's... It's circumstantial. But you said this was a political argument, not a legal one. Are you playing devil's advocate? Or do I get the sense that you want Aritomo to be a spy? I'm here for the truth. But you think they're right, don't you? You think he was a spy. I don't know. I really don't know. But how can you think they're right? This is your career on the line... How? Because I don't know how else to make sense of how... how things ended between me and Aritomo. Yun Ling. Inside. Sakuteiki says one must learn another art to become an expert gardener. This is Hiden Senbazuru Orikata. Secret of One Thousand. Cranes Origami. Legend says, make one thousand cranes and your wish will come true. Why a thousand? Excuse me? That too. Protection from battle. A thousand stitches by a thousand women. Again, a thousand. Good question. I don't know. This is Ukiyoe. Woodblock prints. Ukiyoe means pictures of the floating world. And this is the art I chose. Named Horimono. Horimono (Tattoo Art) Colours become alive on skin. A single design takes many weeks to complete. I assume it's painful. Very much, yes. Learning one thing Japanese is enough for me. Art has no borders, Yun Ling. Your art comes from your culture. Culture has borders. Come with me. There are many different. Japanese gardens. Some for taking a stroll. Some for viewing only. You do not enter. But all gardens should achieve one thing. You're asking me? Yes. To control nature? Yes. But why control it? We control to find balance. We live in a world of madness. A garden reminds us that life can be hard and painful. But still, we can have peace. Do you really believe that? Do you not? If you don't believe why build your sister's garden? Did you supervise Ah Peng, Emily? No, she did it all by herself today. Didn't you? Congratulations, Ah Peng. Mum, what do you want? One more. Tomato, please. How's the lamb? Wonderful, thank you. Another farm's been attacked. I think we should strengthen the fences and get some more guards. Do you know this piece? It's Chopin's first. It was a love letter of sorts to a Polish soprano called. Konstancja Gladkowska. Chopin himself described it as... the impression of someone gently looking at a spot that brings to mind a thousand happy memories. This record never leaves the record player. He plays it every night like we don't have anything else. No. No! Do not tell the story. Tell the story. It was May of 1928. There was to be a performance of Chopin in Kuala Lumpur. So, of course, I had to go. During the second movement just as I was being moved to tears by the larghetto this obnoxious snoring starts from the fellow in front of me. I was so angry I could have hit him. And did you? Before I know it this programme smacks the chap on the head. I looked over. Two seats away from me was this little Chinese woman also in tears, by the way just staring him down. Right then, I knew I was in love. I get impulsive sometimes. So, did Chopin end up with her? The soprano? I believe he had to leave the country. She married someone else. Yun Ling. With all this looting going on around here. I really wish you'd come and stay in the house. Frederick... I know. And maybe it's time to stop working in the garden. Just for a little while. I've actually been wondering about that. What I'm doing in the garden. Well then, maybe it's time to move on. Gosh, I'm sorry. I... I just... I fell in love with you on the spot. You must have known that. I know. So, forget the garden. Stay with me. I can't. Why not? Frederick... I'm sorry. To find balance with nature you must first understand nature. How it grows, why it grows. Do you always have to talk like that? Back there when we were climbing up what did you see? Yun Ling. What did you see? I saw the Orang Asli boy who saved me when I was lost in the jungle. After you escaped from the camp? Will you tell me about the camp? I want to hear about it. No, you don't. I need to hear it. I'm not your responsibility. You made yourself my responsibility from the moment we met. I was 24 when we were taken. We worked 18 hours a day. Seven days a week. If you weren't fit enough you were beaten, or worse... We were in constant terror. Take this girl. Yes, sir. No! Don't fight us. Let go! No! Let go! Yun Hong became one of the chosen ones. Only the youngest would do. I was helpless after that. Day after day. Week after week. I would see the soldiers go and rape my sister. That was good. At 20, she had her first of many abortions. Hurry up! I started to steal for Yun Hong. To keep up her strength. But, Yun Hong, being so kind shared it with the other women. They found out it was me. And they tortured me in front of Yun Hong. They made an example out of me. Took their time. Do it. No... no! Please don't! No! On the day of surrender they marched everyone into the mine. I was still in the doghouse. They had forgotten about me. I'll never forget Yun Hong's face when she saw me free. I turned... and ran. It was the worst thing I ever did. Yun Hong! Yun Hong! I left her. I just left her. Again! One! Two! Three! Aritomo! Yun Ling! Get the sticks! One! Two! Three! Here! Thank you. Ah Cheong! Ah Cheong, get more covers! Yun Ling! Are you OK? The monsoon came early. We cannot work in the garden for several months. I know. Do you wish me to leave? I had an idea last night. For a tattoo. The design came to me complete. From your neck to your hips. Your whole back. Painful. No need to decide now. How much pain? Sit up. Drink before the next part. I'm fine. Trust me. Lie down. Aritomo... You'll be all right. I think I'll have dozens of lanterns floating on the water. Aglow under the moonlight. In the dark of the night the river will look like a starry sky. You will realise how small and insignificant we all are. And how wonderful that is. Did I pass out? You did well. What do you think of when you think of your sister? The cherry blossom. It's finished, right? Leave an empty space to show that life never ends and it's never perfect. You see, missy. He's changing things again. Mr Aritomo. Yes? There are some men outside who want to see you. Association for the Recovery of Fallen Heroes. We apologise for coming here unannounced. We've been travelling to places our soldiers fought and died to bring their remains home. But we were asked to make a detour to come here to deliver this. To Nakamura Aritomo. I'd be honoured to make the arrangements for you to go home. Your country wishes you to return as soon as possible. I see. But I ask for your understanding. My work here is not done yet. We have visited the beaches of Kota Bahru the Perak river and Kuantan. Doing our best to bring every hero home. You should come home too. We'll be at the Smokehouse Hotel in Tanah Rata for two nights. We look forward to your favourable reply. The three men that came... I know who they are. I've heard enough Japanese in the camp to understand. When my country makes a personal request I must consider. How can you consider going back to that country when you know what they have done? I recognised one of the men. He was in our cells. A war criminal? Kempeitai. He was arrested, but never charged. So, no letter from him. What? All your letters are from hanged men, no? To their families? Attempts to humanise themselves! In Japan loyalty to country comes first. Did you just defend murderers and rapists? Is it your place to decide what their families think? Hold it... Hold it. No. Too low. Higher. Hurry up! One! Two! Three! Hold it... Go... More! It's been more than two days since the men came. I know. Don't move! Freeze! Kneel down. Kneel down. Go upstairs and grab what they have. Ask him. Where's the Yamashita Gold? Where's the gold his people stole? He's asking about the gold. Yamashita Gold stolen and hidden by the Japanese. It's all nonsense. Just rumours. What's he saying? He said it doesn't exist. It doesn't exist? Yamashita Gold. Yamashita Gold! No gold! Stop it! You animals! Enough! Emily, keep quiet! Shut up! Emily, do what they say. There's no gold! They've looked before! We've been looking since the war. It doesn't exist! Make him tell the truth or I'll kill you all! Shut up! Don't point that gun at my wife! Stop it! Ah Kwai! Let's go! Let's go! Frederick, he's gone. He's gone. What are you doing? What's wrong with you? Go home, Yun Ling. How can you be working on the garden now? I need to finish it. You don't understand. Well, then tell me what don't I understand? You will never understand! Please. Go home. No! I won't let you push me away. You know me better than that! You know this can never be. Why would I stay if I think that's true? The same reason you are with me. For you... only pain feels right. Thank you. You're welcome. Really appreciate it. It's Nakamura... Yes, it's Nakamura Aritomo. Right. Yes. I'm at the Sevenoaks Tea Estate. OK. And the number is... 491214. Thank you. Anne, meet Yun Ling. Yun Ling, Anne. Hello. Hello. Has he been a good host to you? Of course. Oh, you know Cantonese now? Only when he chooses to. So, I hope you're staying for dinner? Anne's a wonderful cook. Thank you. He only says that when we have guests over. So, did you speak to the nuns? What did they say? Someone's going to call back. Yun Ling. What did you mean when you said how things ended between you and Aritomo? You never got over him? I got engaged twice. And I blamed work both times. Well, when you think of all you've achieved. Yes, all I have achieved... Yun Ling, you do want the federal court, don't you? I'm just tired. Frederick, I'm just so tired. Hello. What's going on? Yun Ling, what did the nun say? She said that Aritomo freed those women by bribing the commander with gold. Gold? Aritomo? Yes. She also mentioned a name which I haven't heard in a long time. Kobayashi Mamuro... You know, I watched him hang in 1949, remember? I do. It was the first thing I asked you, I think. The nun said he was responsible for their comfort station in the convent. Oh yes! That's it. This is the letter he asked me to send. To Kobayashi Masako. And before he was executed he mentioned that... he heard my camp was called kin no yuri, Golden Lily. And he heard it from a man in a convent. My god. Golden Lily. Kin no yuri, my camp... My camp... Oh, yes. Huge crates with crosses were placed in the mines. But we never saw any medication. Never. So, Golden Lily is the Yamashita Gold? But what on earth does Aritomo have to do with the camp? Unless... Unless... Unless he was sent to find a location to hide the Yamashita Gold. Wouldn't this mean he always knew where your sister was buried? Where is everyone? No need. Come on, pull. Why did you add more stones? Come. There's more work to do. What is this? I saw it in your sister's plans. You don't need to do this. Here? Yes. Thank you. No. Thank you. A garden is composed of many clocks. Some go faster... some go slower. All life in the garden has its own time. Yun Ling, don't forget this. Do you always have to talk like that? Shakkei (borrowed scenery)... Aritomo. Where are you going? For a walk. Yun Ling, is everything OK? Frederick, I'm so sorry, but... But there are these stones... You know, there are these standing stones in the garden. Now, they're the four corners of a square and... he added three more after the monsoon to camouflage the square. It's shakkei. It's shakkei with the grass grown around it. Slow down. It's borrowed scenery! What are you talking about? I could... OK. I need to show you something. Please come in. Close the door. Yun Ling... Frederick. If I'm right, the outline of my tattoo should be just the same as Cameron Highlands. Please look at the map and see. Frederick, do you see it? Is it? Yes, it is. And the garden on the map? It's here. And the same place on my tattoo? A square. Aritomo did this? What does it mean? That's just a reference point. OK, there should be... a red cherry blossom near my shoulder. Do you see it? I do. Aritomo did that cherry blossom after asking me what do I think of when I think of my sister. He used time... as borrowed scenery. Letting the grass grow in the garden. He didn't want... the stones to be revealed for years. The cherry blossom. Yes. That's where my sister is. And that's my camp... Golden Lily. By giving me the map. Aritomo would be betraying his country. Why didn't he just tell you? He knew... I needed time. Yes, that's what he borrowed. Time. He didn't think what we had was enough. He didn't believe... I could love him, no matter what. Could you have? If he'd told you then? Yun Ling... Good morning. Good morning. Join me for breakfast. Coffee or tea? Coffee, please. Thanks. Milk? No, thanks. Sorry about last night if I'd disturbed your rest. Don't be. Frederick told me what happened last night. I'm sorry to hear about your past. Good morning, ladies. Good morning. Good morning. I see you started breakfast without me. It would be lunch if we waited for you. All this tea around us and all we ever drink is coffee. Guess what came in the mail this morning? Adam is coming home next month. He's asking what you want him to bring. He's not coming alone. He's bringing his new girlfriend. Jennifer. A fellow medical student. So, should we be getting ready for an expedition? Not today. Knowing where Yun Hong is... is enough. Maybe one day when I'm bankrupt. Besides, revealing the location would only confirm what they're saying about Aritomo. So, you're going to fight the allegations even knowing the truth? Yes, I want to. I want that seat on the federal court. Good. I'm going to see the garden again. I never would have guessed. One more thing. When you write back to your son could you also send these out for me? To Kobayashi Masako. Of course.
