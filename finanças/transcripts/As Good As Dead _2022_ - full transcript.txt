[engine stars] [car stereo music continues] -[intense music playing] -[tires screeching] [car stereo music continues] [song fades away] Maria, Santiago. Let's go. Oh. You can hear. You got that selective hearing, huh? You ever disrespect L-17 again? This pistol will be the last thing you ever hear, bitch. [Oscar] Sorry. What? Sorry. Sorry for disrespecting you. Disrespecting who, motherfucker? You and Eduardo, L-17. [Eric] Shut the fuck up! You had us chasing you all over the streets looking like fucking assholes. If your brother wasn't an L-17 Captain, I would have shot your ass. For the gas I wasted on you, bitch. [exhaling sharply] ["Common Ground" by Bruce Maginnis] Left, right. Elbow. One more time. [vocalizing] Yeah. Good. Higher. Come on. Here you go. Get more of those. Elbow, elbow, elbow. [vocalizing continues] [music fades] [Bryant] Now eventually, your goal is to finish your counter before the end of my thrust. No problem. -You ready? -Yes. [nose brakes] Don't. Don't wipe. Never wipe while in battle. Okay? Shows weakness. Now, there levels to this. Now I showed you normal speed, not my speed. All right? Now, when you get hit, it's...? -My own fault. -That's right. And pain? Teaches us not to let it happen again. Ture. All right? Hey, you good? Yes. Okay, what is it? Competition. Oh, here we go again. [Oscar] How can I test myself if I don't compete with others? Because what I taught you is not for competition. It's for self-defense, which is completely different. How? Mindset, for one thing. To fight professionally, you need a different attitude, techniques, training, sacrifice-- How long did you fight professional? Well, I was... See you tomorrow. [grunting softly] It's good. [rap music playing in the distance] [music intensifying] ["Litty" by Malik Ammon Matthews and Nathan Gillespie playing] -[music stops] -[Hector grunts] Let me out early. -[Hector] Come over here. -[Oscar] How did you find me? [Hector] What do you think? I can't keep tabs -on my little brother? -[both laughing] [Hector speaking in Spanish] [in English] Look at you, man. You look great. -Thanks. -You're a real man. Who's this guy? -Well, he's... -I'll tell you who he is. He's a cop. The way he looks, the way he stands, I can smell these motherfuckers mile away. What do you want with my brother, cop? Come on, Hector. He's no cop. He's my friend, my teacher. He's cool. Have you seen Maria and Santiago yet? Come on. I know you missed them. They sure been missing you. [Hector] Yes, I do. I do miss them. Let's go see them. [Bryant] Oscar. Be careful. Go. [engine starts] Let's go. [boxers grunting] [Oscar] How much is it to join the gym? Twenty a month. [Oscar] Okay. The next five months. How old are you? -Why? -[Marisol] If you're under 18, you need a signature of a parent or guardian to be in here. How old are you? [Marisol] Seventeen. But my dad owns this gym. Okay. I'll be back. [Marisol] Hey. I told you, you need the signature of a parent to be in here. Okay, Marisol. It's written on your binder. Bye. [both grunts] ["Wind You Waist" by Marc JB playing] ♪ Wind your waist ♪ ♪ Wind your waist ♪ Boom. -What do you got for me? -[Eric chuckles] [Hector] Show me what you got for me. I want to go home now. What do you mean you're going home? What's the matter with you? This is my welcome home party. [Eric] Your brother don't like to hang with us. He thinks we're beneath him. I got a work in the morning, So you got a work in the morning? For who? -A fucking cop. -He's not a cop. Well, forget about that guy. Screw that guy, all right? You're coming with us. We're gonna go gamble. I don't gamble. See, I told you. He thinks betting on the underground fights is beneath him. Wait. -Underground fights? -[Hector] Mm-hmm. Go. Oh, come on. -Come on. Come on. -[Hector] Body shot. Body shot. [Hector] Give me a body shot. [both grunting] -Oh! Oh! -[crowd cheering] [grunting continues] [cheering continues] -[Eric] No! No! No! -Oh! Sweet. See, I told you. I told you it was gonna be under a minute. -Pay up. -[cheering and whistling continues] Is there any other challenger that want to fight The Collector? [George] Me! I am. Come on, George. Come on up. [announcer] If you last one round with The Collector, you get 5000. But if you beat him, you're going to get 10,000 pesos. Let's hear it for Big George. You've got big balls, man. [laughs] -Yeah! Big balls! -Let's go. [cheering and whistling continues] [George grunts] [Hector] What the fuck? -Yeah. -Fuck. Shit. [cheering and applause continues] Hey. Where are you going? I'll be right back. That was ugly. Somebody else crazy enough to fight The Collector? Hey, Oscar. Oscar! [crowd cheers lowly] Are you kidding me? What the fuck are you doing? What's your name, man? Oscar. Right here. [cheering and applause] [intense music playing] [crowd] Woo. [The Collector] Grr. [Oscar grunting] [crowd] Oh! [The Collector] Argh.

Keep your head down, yeah? Swing the body through the ball. [chuckles] Okay, not bad. In regards to your equity and telecom, -that's another story, -[cell phone vibrates] which we'll get to in a minute. Excuse me, gentlemen. John, keep your head down. Try a few more. You'll get the hang of it. -[chuckles] -[John] Okay. Why the fuck am I seeing your goddamn name on my phone, you dumb fucking mutt? You always go through my assistant. You're not-- One video? [dramatic music playing] [Sonny] Bitsy, the fucking track star, and he screams, "Phone." But in the alley, it kind of sounded like gun. -[Griffiths] Gun, gun. -I... [chuckles] No, even when the threat goes down... -Dag, Dag and Chuck, remember? You remember? -Yeah, yeah. -Yeah. -Yeah. Well, they had to die for cover from their own guy. I, I felt a couple of rounds whiz by me. And I'm thinking, -for one split second, -[Dagestiono] Yeah. am I going to have the plug the Fitz? -[chuckles] -That might have been a little difficult explaining to internal affairs. [all chuckles] Oh. Excuse me, gentlemen. [smacks lips] My psych session is up, and, um, I think it may go a little longer than anticipated. Yeah. So I suggest you be ready when your turn comes. You're going to have to fit him in the appointed hour. All right, cap. Have a good time in there. Uh, don't worry about me. [chuckles] [correctional officer] Kilbane. What? Let's go. Your lawyer's here. Shit. [dramatic music playing] What? [cell phone beeps] [cheering and whistling through the cell phone] [crowd through cell phone] Oh! Oh! There's got to be some connection here. Nobody else fights like that. Where was this? In Mexico, near the border. A place called Nogales. Well, you got to find him. Completion guarantees a longer life. [chuckles] Who? The Guzman brothers owe us a favor. Take care of it. [vehicle approaching] [engine stops] I don't hear from you in nearly a week, and you bring this to my house. -What the fuck do you mean by "this"? -[Oscar] Hey, please. -I'm sorry, Bo. -Mr. Davis. I'm sorry, Mr. Davis. I would've called, but I never had your number. That still doesn't explain why you would bring them to my place. [Hector] Well, allow me to explain. Oscar wants to fight professionally, and I'm gonna pay you to train him. No, no. I can pay for myself now. Where the hell did you get that kind of money? Why does it matter? Are you gonna train him or not? The answer is no. Now, please get off my property Fuck your piece of shit property. You don't even know how much money I'm offering you. Oscar, I know he's your brother. But if you hang around this guy, he's going to get you killed. [Hector] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Keep talking. You're going to be the one who's gonna get killed. Hector, please. Just give us a moment. I'm so sorry, Mr. Davis. This wasn't my idea, but it's true. I'd very much like to compete. Look, I'm sorry, but the answer is no. -But why? -[Bryant] Oscar-- -Hey, what do we have here? -[Bryant] Hey, back off! Look, I'm sorry, but I can't. But look, even if you decide to compete, please promise me that you won't use the style that I taught you. [Hector] Hey, is this a classic? Hey! What did I tell you? I told you to back off. Yeah, I don't think so. You might be able to fight, but you're not gonna be able to block a bullet. So you back the fuck off! How's this? Far enough? Now with your thumb and forefinger of your left hand, grab your weapon. But first, take it out, put it on the ground. Do it now! You in the car, you make a move, Hector gets shot. Down. Move. Keep moving. If you turn back around, I will shoot you. Do you understand me? Guy sounds like a real surveyor to me. [Bryant] Keep it moving, Hector. Go! I need you to drive down the road, stop and wait for Oscar. If your hands leave the steering wheel for any reason, your head becomes a piñata. Keep your hands up. [engine starts] So sorry, Mr. Davis. Never meant for this to happen. [Bryant] Oscar, when he stops that car, I need you to get in the passenger seat and never come back here. You understand me? Yes. Yes, sir. [Hector] This ain't over, pinche cop. [Hector] I want to sign my brother with your best trainer. Mm, that will be my father. We can start with the paperwork. [Hector] All right. So, I saw the video. You either have the best beginner's luck or you're the ghost of Bruce Lee. You destroyed the toughest guy in town. Had a good teacher. Xbox. Oh. [Hector] So... [door opens] [door closes] You're Oscar, no? Yes. Bryant. Is he here? I don't know any Bryant. Your instructor. Big Black guy. -This guy. -[Hector] Hey, what's going on here, carnales? -What do you want with my brother? -[Ivan] We're fight promoters. We saw Oscar on YouTube. I wanted to know if you had representation. [Rueben] Really? I know all the promoters in this country. What's your company? We're an outside company from the U.S. I'm originally from San Diego. Which one? Who are your fighters? [chuckles] Look, we're just looking for someone. [Hector] Hmm. You're just looking for someone. Well, let me tell you something. We know you're not promoters. And we also know that you are two identical lying piece of shit. We haven't seen that guy. So get the fuck out of my face. Get the fuck out! Okay. Okay, macho. Listen to me. I know we all have our past, and believe me, I have my own. But if you're going to bring this bullshit... ...I'm going to ask you to look for another gym. [Hector] Ah, I'm sorry about that, sir. I apologize. It won't happen again. Okay. All right, show's over. What was that about? These guys were looking for Mr. Davis. -Who are they? -[Oscar] Hitters. [Hector scoffs] Hitmen. I know their type very well. -We gotta warn Mr. Davis. -Forget about that guy, all right? I've been telling you that forever. Forget about him. I told you he was a cop, didn't I? Why does that make him a bad guy? Look, I owe him my life, Hector. I was able to pay our bills and feed Santiago and Maria because of him. You wouldn't be driving that car if you didn't teach me what I know. Look, I have to warn him. All right. I'm gonna drive you all the way to him, but I'm staying in the car. I'm not getting out. You better bring her with you, 'cause I'm not sure he wants to see your face either. I wouldn't mind. Fucking kidding me? I'm sorry, Mr. Davis, but Oscar has something important to tell you. Who are you? I'm Marisol, a friend of Oscar. My father runs the MMA gym. So, can we speak to you? [Hector] You don't have to worry about me. I'm staying right here. I got my gun, anyway. We were at her father's gym, and two guys came in looking for you. They said your name was Bryant. They were twins. Twins? Bald, Cuban, about my height? -Yes. -Yes. [dramatic music] -Did you come here straight from the gym? -Yes. Why? Oscar, Marisol, get in the house right now. Go. Come, come on. Go, go. Hector, I need you to get in the house right now. Who do you think I am? Sucker? I'm not pendejo. What's up with the gun? Uh, look, I'll explain later. I'm gonna give you your gun back. This better not be a trick. -Hector, run! -[gunshots] -[intense music] -[gunshots] [reloads gun] You hang around this guy, he's gonna get you killed. [gunshots] Don't worry. The whole place is steel-plated. [muffled bullet sounds] Oh, so you were expecting company, huh? Pinche cop. What the fuck are you up to, huh? -He's not a cop, Hector. -I was a cop. -LAPD and DEA. -[scoffs] I took down their boss and most of his organization. They've been wanting me dead for years. I just don't know how they found me. Do you think it could be from the YouTube video where you beat collector at the casino? It got a lot of views. Hey, they stopped firing. You think they're gone? [gunshots] Shit. I'm calling my guys right now. No, no, no. You don't wanna do that. Your men will be slaughtered. The Guzman twins, professionals. I'll tell you what? I need you to walk by that window at precisely 7:45. Can you do that? -It's bullet-proof, right? -Yeah. All right. I'll be back. Pinche Terminator [dramatic music] [gunshots] [swishes] [engine revving] [car door closes] [Bryant] Hey. What's up? It's not gonna happen. You're one of a kind now. He's gone. [dramatic music] [grunting] [grunting] [exhales] [grunting continues] [groaning] Who ordered this? Was it Kilbane? [panting] Fuck you. [chuckles] [groans] You think I'm playing games, huh? [intense music] [coughs] -[Bryant] All right? -[breathing heavily] Let try this again. Who ordered? [panting] [grunting] Fuck you. [screaming] I didn't light him on fire. He lit himself on fire. I was just bluffing. How the hell did you get outside? You were in that room. What's important right now is that you all get to safety. They could have called for reinforcements. Once the twins turn up missing, they're gonna send more people. Look, I'll get rid of the twins' bodies, but I trust you'll want your guys to get a proper burial. Yeah. Yeah, of course, I wanna do that. Let me tell you something. You should pay for it. It's your fault that-- We do not have time for that right now. Right now you're all in danger. You need to leave. They won't come after you. I just need the time remaining to pack up my life and go. [dramatic music] [exhales] Okay. Ladies first. What the hell is this? After the DEA radar worked on, we found these tunnels. That why I built my house here. -Yeah, but now they found you. -Yeah. So, who hired the hit squad? A man named Sonny Kilbane, former police captain. He was behind a drugs, weapons, and human trafficking ring. Had judges and DEA in his pocket. Now, he's doing double life in prison. And all because of you, huh? Why did you leave? They can't hurt you, they hurt the ones you love. Woman in your picture in your kitchen. That's right. They found her and... ...beat her up pretty bad. But I showed up. [gagging] [knife slices] [grunting] [Bryant] I told her to say that I beat her. So the surface story would be that I fled from my domestic violence assault charge. It would explain my disappearance, and the guys who did it, well, they were never supposed to be there, anyway, right? If you're gone long enough, you're as good as dead. So I guess you could say I put myself into my own little witness protection program. You were a cop. What about the real witness protection? [scoffs] Well, who do you think runs that? See, I told you that. Never trust cops. Here you go, El Chapo. Here's where we part ways, okay? Now you take this tunnel about a half a mile down, you'll see a ladder on your right side. You take that up, you'll be beside an equestrian center. -All right. -You'll be safe to make a call there for a ride. Okay? All right. Let's go. Oscar... ...take care of yourself. [dramatic music] [thud] [thud] [thud] [thud] [thud] [thud] [gunshots] [gunshots] Cops, my ass. [sprinkler turns on] [screaming] What the... [screams] [light turns off] [gunshots] [light turns on] [clicks] [whoosh] Fuck are you waiting for? Get out of here. [engine revving] [Sonny] Valdez is gonna want retribution. But, Sonny, these men were paid. That doesn't matter. He dispatched eight men without a scratch. They're gonna claim we didn't prep them. Okay. I mean... ...what do you want me to do? What do I want you to do? I want you to hurt him and anyone else close to him. Well, that's the thing. This guy, apparently, beat the shit out of his fiancé, and it seems she's the only one he cared about. Good news. At least now, we know where he is. Hey, hey, if this man is not silenced, there goes all our assets. Which means you and your family would have to start looking for your own Nogales. Guard. [Hector] Place was clean. [sighs] No cars. No bodies. No burned-top twin guy. Nothing. No doubt, it was your guy. He must be some kind of Black Rambo. [scoffs] Hey. Ram-bro. [chuckles] -You think he's gonna stay? -Hell no. Unless he's crazy. He knows those guys are gonna come back and nuke that place if he's around. But, listen, forget about that, all right? You gotta train, huh? You're a fighter. You gotta focus on becoming a badass yourself. Huh? You feel me? Now, I gotta go and tell two of men's soft ladies that they ain't gonna come back home. [sniffles] Keep your mind at right place. We'll start tomorrow, right? See you around. [woman sobbing] [woman sobbing] [woman sniffs] [intense music] [knife slices] Hey, hey, hey, hey. You thought I won't recognize it... I had nothing to do with it, but I wish I did. Now what? You think I'm gonna start begging for my life, huh? Fuck you and your mama, bitch. Hmm. Now, we can take our time to find out what you really know. You may think you won't tell me, but believe me, believe me, you will. I don't know shit. Here we go again. Where is Bryant Powell? Are you deaf? I already told you I don't know shit. I had no idea he was a cop. He was training my brother. Wrong answer. [gunshot] [grunts] [intense music] Nobody move, nobody get shot in the fucking head. Drop the gun. Drop the gun or I'll kill your friend. [Bryant] He's not my friend. Let him go, and nobody else gets hurt. No deal. You know why? Because you're fucked up. You should have killed me when you had your chance. -You let him live? -He was no longer a threat. Pretty fucking ironic, huh? [sighs] You're smart, Raza. You kill him, what do you think is gonna happen to you? Look around you. There's too many of us. -Even if you-- -[gunshot] [gunshot] [grunting] [dramatic music] [screams] [grunts] [grunts] [grunting] [panting] [grunts] [grunting] [exasperated sigh] No fucking way. [scoffs] All right, seriously, we're gonna have to start calling you Ram-bro. No, no, no, no. No, no, no! Wait, wait! I'm sorry. No nicknames. I'm sorry. How do you find me? [sighs] There's no safer place than being behind the guy who's chasing you. [exhales] [sniffles] So you were following Raza, huh? Yeah. Come on. Oh. [chuckles] I knew it was a '68 Camaro SS. [clears throat] [engine revving] [dramatic music] [knocks] You think it's safe to be here? Hector was here. He said it was like nothing happened. He was right. His work truck is missing. His other car's still here. -Wait here. I'll be right back. -Oscar! [grunting] [intense music] [grunting] [grunting continues] [grunting continues] [grunting continues] Mm, wait. Oscar. I'm a friend. Friend of Bryant. Bryant Powell. Bo Davis. He was my captain. My sensei. Follow me. Come on. It's okay. [Oscar] Well, where is he? Is he okay? [sighs] Well, that's what we're trying to find out. We hoped you knew. Listen, he's in trouble within the Nogales cartel, and time is really precious right now. Oscar, I owe my life to Bryant, so I joined the task force so I can help get him out. The DEA, they won't. They turned their backs on him. He has a domestic incident as an excuse. Yeah, he told us. Would you excuse us, miss, please? Come here. Listen, me... [sighs] I know Bryant better than anyone. I don't believe that shit for a second. What are the dogs for? Bomb-sniffing dogs. We had to make sure the whole place wasn't rigged with explosives before we breached it. We think he might have fled in a stolen vehicle. What's the color, make and model of the vehicle? I don't know. He always kept the car covered, and I never asked. Have a think. Uh, is there a place he went to frequently? Like a friend's or a girlfriend? Maybe a bar? No. Listen, what about your brother, Hector? Hmm? I heard he was capo of L-17. He might have the information on diablos. I can talk to him. My brother hates cops. So you think he did something to Bryant? No. Why not? You said he hates cops. Why wouldn't he just kill Bryant, or feed him to the diablos? Bryant saved us. [laughs] Oscar, my man. [chuckles] You know a lot more than you're letting on to. So you're gonna talk to me, because Bryant's life depends on it. Can I make sure she gets home? Nonsense. She can come with us. Let's move. Heading back. Marisol. [Bryant] You're quiet for once. I don't know what to say. Thank you for saving me, or fuck you for putting me in danger in the first place? Sorry I asked. Huh? You were in a gang. Ah, well, we all have our past. What happened? What did you do to make these guys wanna kill you? I went to prison undercover as a underground cage fighter and brought down a ring of drugs, illegal weapons, and human trafficking. Like Van Damme in that movie, In Hell. No. No. He went to prison 'cause he shot a guy outside the courthouse. Well, he still ended up fighting a prisoner. I, I know it's something with Van Damme. It was probably, uh... ...Kickboxer: Retaliation. That was Alan Moussi or Moussi or something like that. Bloodfist III: Forced To Fight. No, that's Don "The Dragon" Wilson. You're probably thinking about Locked Down. Yeah, it has some similarities, but Van Damme wasn't in that either. I got it. Death Warrant. Yeah. Death Warrant, Van Damme plays this cop, and he, he went underground, and, and fight this creepy Sandman who he personally sent to prison, huh? How's that anything like my story? Oh, undercover cop, illegal fighting. Black market organ dealing? No, I'm, I, if anything, I'd say I'm more like, Raid: Redemption. It's much more like my story and a way better movie. I thought we were going downtown. I never told you that. Oh, wait, did I? No. Where are we going? An undisclosed location. [suspenseful music] [cell phone dialing] [cell phone vibrating] What's up, bro. What? Oscar, I can't hear you. You have to speak up. DEA Agent Eric Green is taking us north. Eric Green? He's taking you where? Oscar, don't say my name. Do not trust Eric Green. If he's taking you anywhere, get away immediately. I can't In his car with Marisol. Oscar, can you describe where you're headed? Now, would you close the window? Got the AC on. Just wanted some fresh air. You know, that wasn't a fucking question, all right? Who are you talking to? I said, who the fuck are you talking to? My brother. I'm leaving a message for my brother. Give me your phones. Both your phones down, now. Three, five, eight, N, double O, six, seven, five, L, three, seven. Three, five, eight, N, double O, six, seven, five, L, three, seven. Write that down. Three, five, eight, N, double O... [gasps] L, three, seven, I got it. Who the hell's Eric Green? My former protégé, he tried to get me killed. He has Oscar. Fucking why? He probably thought Oscar can lead him to me, but I think Oscar just helped lead us to him. [Hector] What the hell are we waiting for? Let's go kill these motherfuckers and get Oscar. If there's one motherfucker in this planet who can do this, it's you. Uh, if I'm right, we're gonna need some more motherfuckers. [Oscar gagging] -[Oscar choking, coughing] -What the fuck is wrong with you? -[coughing] -[Eric] Get him out of the car. Better here outside than on his fucking doorstep. You ready, Princess? [Bryant] Okay, looks like Oscar passed under a bridge going south on the 15, headed toward Henry Seale about three minutes ago. Oh, yeah, I know that area very well. -A lot of powerful people living out there. -Yeah. [Hector] Future of Lords as well. I'm guessing they don't know about your extraction yet. Once they find out that I sprung you, they'll be on you to get to me. Yeah, but then they're going to kill Oscar -because they won't need him anymore. -Oh, no, no, no. No. They'll need him even more because he's a bargaining chip for you to give me up. [suspenseful music] Hear me out. [gate opening] Let's move. Come on. Please let her go. She has nothing to do with this. You did this to her, Oscar. You should've told me everything you knew in the first place. And now, everything bad that's going to happen to her is because of you. And, by the way, we have your brother, if he's still left in one piece. Let's go. Move. Sonny Kilbane is my friend. But he lost at his game. But you have to understand this guy has been a pebble in his shoe for years, and Sonny wants him to pay with his life. A life on the run is no life. Look, Don Valdez, we appreciate the generosity. Okay. And as Mr. Kilbane has helped you rise to power, we appreciate the reciprocation in your hospitality, -but we need this done. -Uh-- And your problem is beneath my time. I understand. But this man, you have to understand he's an elite soldier, and we need this taken care of. [exclaims] -Oh. -[Eric] I trained under him. I know what he knows. I know how he thinks. And this kid right here is a close student of his. Your men, they have his brother, who's an L-17 captain at your facility right now. He'll know where Bryant Powell is. Apparently, your Mr. Powell just extracted Hector and killed 15 of my men. Tell me again that you know how he thinks. And you... -...just get me an excuse. -Come on. Come on. Don Valdez, we, we can get him now. They're probably still together. Hey, call your brother. I don't know his number. You threw my phone out the window. You don't know your brother's number? [Oscar] Do you know yours? Whose number do you know by heart? We have his number in our records. I just need to make a call and we'll track him down. [Bryant] They're gonna try to run a chase on Hector's phone, which will be right here. We line up around this perimeter and wait for them to break through. Once they do, it will just be them, Hector's phone, and grenades. Boom. [all] Yes. Those guys are bleeding right now, and I'm telling you, I saw at least ten million dollars worth out there before he snatched me, right? -Let's go, let's do this. -[cheering] So you miss your calling. You could be a great narco shot caller and have everything you want in life. [exclaims] No, no, no. See, I'm like you. Already embrace who I am and the life I chose, and I do not want to be looking over my shoulder. That's what I want. [Rios] Got it. Brother's number. Call him. He won't answer calls from strange numbers. -I've to text him. -Just do it! What are all those numbers, huh? They're a code, so he knows it's me. Change it every week. [suspenseful music] [cell phone ringing] [shushing] [phone continues ringing] -Fuck are all these numbers? -Don't do anything. Hold on. Don't answer it. [cell phone ringing] I know exactly where they are. Listen up, everybody. He could be in the bathroom. Look, we'll make it work, Don Valdez, no matter what. We'll, we'll, we'll make this right.
