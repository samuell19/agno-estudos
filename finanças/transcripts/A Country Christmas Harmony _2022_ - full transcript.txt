Welcome back to the Christmas Song Countdown where we're reviewing all the latest Christmas singles from some of your favorite artists. I'm your ho-ho host, Leslie Manalo, letting you know which songs made the nice list and which songs did not. Just this week, Chrissy Kessler dropped her latest single, Reindeer Slaay, in advance of her upcoming live TV Christmas concert. But unfortunately for Kessler, her new single finds itself at the top of our naughty list. Hard to believe, right? I know. Well, don't take my word for it. Here's a clip from the Reindeer Slaay music video. Take a look. ♪ Baby kiss me under mistletoe ♪ ♪ Hold me tight and don't you ever let go ♪ ♪ Baby I'm your present unwrap me yeah I said it ♪ ♪ Can't take it back no gift receipt ♪ ♪ I know you won't regret ♪ ♪ We can go all night up to Christmas Day ♪ ♪ Let's take a ride something off the way ♪ ♪ Ho-ho-ho ♪ ♪ Let's hurry it up ♪ ♪ Can't you know that I can't wait?

Typically known for her soulful vocals, Kessler has instead decided to dive head-first into the world of over-produced pop. Now, while that style works for other artists, it fits Kessler like a Santa Suit fits a Christmas gnome. - Someone call Rudolph. - Oh, how about that? 'Cause Santa is not coming to town. Time to jingle all the way out. That was your last warning, Chrissy. If you watch anymore coverage on Reindeer Slaay, I'm putting you in a time-out. At this point, a time-out sounds like a nice break from real life. I'm serious, honey. Okay, Eugene. I promise, TV stays off. Why? And that includes staying off all social, or looking up any articles. What? I was texting my manicurist. I've been making all of your appointments for the past ten years, you wouldn't know your manicurist's number if it came screaming down your chimney on Christmas Eve. - All right. - Oh, speaking of appointments. We have to be at your manager's office in 30 minutes. Oh, right. If anyone can fix this nightmare release, it's Carole. Do you mind if I give you a little tough love, my beautiful, amazing, best friend in the entire world? Oh, dear, if you're already buttering me up, this is gonna be bad. Okay. Go. Don't get your hopes up, Carole is good, but what you need is a Christmas miracle. Well, then I guess it's a good thing I believe in miracles. - You have my water, right? - And my earphones, your purse. ♪ Give me just a reason to believe ♪ ♪ 'Cause I've been waiting all year long ♪ ♪ Under the Christmas tree I don't ♪ - Thank you. - Is that my favorite client? Good to see you, my dear. Right this way. We've no time to waste. Well, first of all I just wanna say thank you for scrambling to come up with a plan. And I'm very excited to hear it. But I've also been doing a lot of thinking about everything. When I was first starting out, I felt good knowing that I was doing everything I could to chase my dreams. But lately it just feels like I'm chasing trends. And I just wanna get back to the real me. And that's precisely what we're going to do. You, my dear, have an opportunity to turn everything around with your upcoming televised Christmas concert. First, the label would like to cut bait on Reindeer Slaay. Instead, you're going to debut a brand-new single live on-air. We've reached out to several writers and they're coming up with brand-new songs as we speak. Okay. Um, what if I don't hear anything that I like? Maybe I should try and write something. I mean, I know it's been a while since I've written my own stuff. You can certainly try, but we can't count on that. You're gonna be very busy rehearsing for the concert. Okay. Sure. And thankfully we only have the one original song to try and figure out. For the rest of the concert, we were thinking you'd perform songs from your last Christmas album. That's a great idea. Those songs, they really had heart. I couldn't agree more. And from the heart is exactly what this concert needs, which is why this next piece of the plan is the most important part. Chrissy Kessler, Home For The Holidays. The label, the network and I have come up with the idea to re-brand the concert in an effort to rehabilitate your image. Instead of performing in Nashville at a big arena, you'll be performing in front of friends and family, live from your hometown of Cedar Pines. - Oh. No. No, no. - No, no. - I'm sorry. No, I can't. - Just wait, Chrissy. - Hear me, hear me out. - Y-you-you don't understand. - Just hear me out. - No, you just don't understand. Okay? I-I don't have any family or friends left there. I haven't been back home since I left for Nashville ten years ago. I would really, really like to keep my past where it belongs. - I understand. I really do. - Okay. And if you don't wanna go, you don't have to. Okay. Okay. But if I'm being honest, I'm really worried, Chrissy. The label isn't happy. And if this concert doesn't go well, I'm afraid they might drop you. I'm sorry, honey, but that's the truth. You really think this plan will work? I really do. Okay. - I'll go. - Hm. You'll both leave tonight. Your tickets have already been purchased. And try not to be so worried. This is gonna work. Yeah. Yeah. Um, where did she say we were going? Home, sweet home. I'm so sorry, babe, I really thought we'd get to spend Christmas together this year. Stop apologizing, if it's not you that has to leave for work, it's me. But after five years of spending the holidays apart, I think we've perfected the FaceTime Christmas. You sure you can't fly out? No, I wish, but I gotta work, too. You know I'd be there in a heartbeat if I could take off. - I know. - I love you. ♪ The magic happens ♪ I'm really sorry, I know how much you were looking forward to spending Christmas together this year. Mm. I'll be okay. But what about you? How do you feel being home? I can tell you're nervous because you're doing the water thing. - What water thing? - The same water thing you do. Every time you get nervous. You've been sipping that non-stop. Uh-huh. I have avoided this place for the last decade. What was I thinking agreeing to come back? Decade? When did your parents move away again? They retired to Key West almost immediately after I left for Nashville. They're so funny. My mom started calling herself Key Lime Kathy. Okay, so your parents don't live here, but... But what? Come on. The guy you left behind? You know, broke up with him on Christmas morning, in a letter, before running away to Nashville. Any of this ring a bell? Why do you know everything about my life? Because you tell me everything about your life. - It's true. - So? Does this man still live here? The man's name is Luke, and I wouldn't know. We haven't spoken since I left. And I'd really like to keep it that way. So if you happen to see him around town somewhere, please warn me. Oh, how? I don't even know what he looks like. You know, 6'2, eyes that light up a room and a jawline so sharp, you could chop down Christmas trees with it. Wow, okay. We need to find somewhere with a bathroom. Quick! All right, see you. Thanks. Have a good night. So, grandma, you being helpful over there or just a pain? Oh, look, someone left their number for you on their receipt. - So a pain, then. - But this one looks nice. I mean, she took the time to draw a little happy face and everything. You're impossible. Oh, the last thing I need right now is a girlfriend. Oh, you can say that till you're blue in the face, but it doesn't mean it's true. When was the last time you went out on a date, anyhow? Had to be right before your sister passed. - Grandma, please. - Oh, I'm sorry. I know it's uncomfortable. But I think this is something that you need to hear. Look at me, Luke. Now, your sister was a fine girl. I've never known a sweeter woman in my whole life. And what happened to her wasn't fair. First her husband walks out, then the accident. But what you did, deciding to take over this bar, keep her legacy alive, then stepping up to raise her boy. Well, I never knew really what faith was until I saw that. But Brandon is ten years old now. I know he'd understand if, if you found a lady. How can you be so sure? I mean... What if I meet someone and he doesn't like her? I feel like something like that could, could really mess a kid up. Or he could fall in love with her, same as you. Like I said, last thing I need right now is a distraction. Ooh. Oh! Oh. So sorry to just run in here like that. But seriously, you saved me from a disaster. - Chrissy? - Luke. What is taking her so long? Six-foot-two, eyes that light up a room, a jawline that could chop down a Christmas tree. Oh, no. This isn't good. Okay, enough with the theatrics. You'd think the ghost of Marilyn Monroe just walked in looking for a stiff one. Oh, my goodness. Pearl. I-I didn't even see you standing there. - Of course you didn't. - Hi. Oh. Well, I know her, but I don't know you. Oh, I'm sorry. I should have introduced myself. I'm Eugene, Chrissy's assistant. Oh, no need to apologize. It's quite the shock for everybody. I'm Pearl, and that there is my grandson, Luke. - Hi. - Oh. It's good to see you, kid. - Oh, you look great. - Oh! No! I look like a little old lady who dyes her hair red. - No. - You look great. Oh, stop it. You're gonna make me blush. So, brings you back here? Hello to you, too. Home For The Holidays. So you're back here for Christmas or... Yeah. I mean, that is the big night. Isn't that lovely? What's it been? Ten years and some change? I bet Chrissy doesn't even know you're running your own restaurant. Why don't you bring her here for dinner? Show off that prize-winning menu of yours. Say, isn't tomorrow your day off? Ah, y-yes, it is, but I-I actually can't... Well, I can't tomorrow, actually, because I'm busy. - Well, I'm busy too, so I can't. - Oh, you're busy? - Yeah, can't do it. - What do you mean you can't? I have more of a social life than you, and by more, I mean, I actually have one. - Chrissy, honey. - Yes. You've been gone a long time. Some things around here haven't changed. What I say still goes. So you are having dinner with my grandson, and that's all there is to it. Yes, ma'am. - Okay. Thoughts? - I like it. What? It's so boring! Like, I thought the striped one was boring, but this one's so boring, I just fell asleep looking at it while describing its insane level of boringness. - Brandon! - I'm sorry. But yesterday I didn't even know you knew Chrissy Kessler. No wonder you play her music all the time. Is that so? I wouldn't say it's all the time. No, he does, and then tonight not only did I find out that you know her, but Grandma Pearl tells me that you're going on a date with her. So it's obviously the coolest thing ever. But that tie still doesn't work, and you really can't wear it, so... Tough crowd. Okay, fine. And why are you telling him I'm going on a date? Isn't it a date? Did you just answer my question with a question? Did you just answer my question with a question? Okay, first of all, it's not a date. And second of all, the only reason I'm going is because you're making me. Oh. I'm out of ties. I know. Do you... Oh, wow! That right there is a tie. Where, where did you get this from? I bought it with my allowance. It was worth every cent. Okay. Wow. Then... - You have to wear it. - I probably should wear it. I mean, you bought it. Bring it over here. Let's try it on. Thank you. This one off. Hi, guys, so while I'm back home, I thought I would show you a little bit of the town that I grew up in. This right here is my favorite spot in town. Great food, better drinks. And whenever I come back for a visit, I will not leave until I come here to check out the local talent and, you know, knock back a few with a couple of old friends. - Is that right? - Hi. Oh. We'll just pick this up later. - Got it. Have fun! - Um, sorry about that. I just promised my team that I would post as much as possible while I'm in town. It's alright. Oh, gosh. Oh, God. Gosh. Sorry. So, here we are. - Yup. - Yeah, this is strange. - Yeah, it's... Yeah, extremely. - Isn't it? Yeah. Um... Oh, you don't, you don't need to worry about that, I already told the boys in the back what to bring out to the table. How do you know what I want? Hm. Yeah. You're right. Never could figure out what you wanted. I meant what I wanted to eat. Thanks, buddy. You know what, if we're gonna have dinner together, can we at least try and be civil? It's been ten years, Luke. Maybe it would be nice to just, just catch up without butting heads. I was being rude. Can we just start again? Well, it sounds like a plan. Okay. Okay, okay. - You said that? What? - Do you remember... Do you remember this one, the show we did in that little bar way out in, like, Jackson County? Well, like, what, three people showed up? Maybe four? Yeah. Yeah, I... Ah. You remember the guy with the pig? - You remember that? - The pig! Oh, my gosh. I forgot about the pig. You almost got punched that night. Ah, well, yeah, I guess I probably shouldn't have said we accept all tips including bacon. You didn't have my back, by the way. - What was I supposed to do? - I don't know. I would've sold you out in a hot second. Man... Oh. Wow. It, this is so... It's-it's just weird to think that all we had back then were some crappy used guitars and a couple of, couple of picks I stole from the school band room. Why anyone would wanna come out and hear two very amateur singers who are just starting out? Oh, you can just stop with the false modesty. - No... - Ah. People came to hear you sing. Yeah. Well, don't sell yourself short, Luke. I mean, maybe I had the better voice. Just a, just a little bit. You know, but the songs I wrote for myself were never as good as the ones you wrote for me. And all anybody could talk about back then was the magic you were making with that guitar. Yeah, well, not anymore, they're not. These days the only thing I'm famous for around here are my ribs. Well, that's a shame. No. No, it's, it's fine. Really. Yeah. You know, all those years on the road, I, I just realized that having a place to call home was more important to me than music was. Home is right here in Cedar Pines. So I guess we, uh, I guess we both kinda got what we wanted, right? I guess we did. Yeah. Okay, well, I gotta ask. Who is the girl? The, the what? Oh, come on. I know that you did not pick out that awful tie all on your own. - This tie? Right. - It's terrible. You are right. I did not pick this out. - Um... - Yeah. Uh, yeah, Brandon, Brandon picked this out. - My nephew. - That's funny. Yeah. Um, uh... My sister, uh, she actually, um, she passed away a couple of years after you left. And so I, uh, I adopted him as soon as I could. I had no idea. Luke, I'm so sorry. Um, if it's okay with you, I would really love to meet Brandon. I'm sure we can, uh, figure something out. Okay. Oh, you should bring him to the concert. Uh, w-w-what concert? I told you last night. Home For The Holidays. I came home to do a live Christmas concert from back where it all began. Chrissy Kessler, Home For The Holidays. - Right. - Yeah. What? Here I thought that you came back because you actually missed this place. This whole thing is just a big publicity stunt. - Isn't it? Really? - No. It's not. Really. Well, then, then what was that crap you were saying when I walked in here, about how this was your favorite restaurant, you know, and you liked to come and catch up with old friends or whatever? Because we both know you've never been to this restaurant, because my sister bought this place a couple of months after you left. I... You, you're this big star, Chrissy. There isn't an ounce of authenticity left in you. I mean, because when I knew you, there wasn't a dirt road in this entire town you didn't know. I bet you couldn't even find it on a map. Exactly. You know, you shouldn't be calling your concert Home For The Holidays when you don't even know what that word means anymore. ♪ When you came ♪ How on Earth am I gonna write this? Hi, Carole. Hi. Have you had a chance to listen to any of the demos I sent? I did. Uh, yeah, I listened to all of 'em. I-I don't know. It's just, none of 'em really felt right to me. Oh. Don't worry. We'll find something. All right, yeah. Is that all? No. I had an idea. And I need you to hear me out before shooting it down, okay? - Oh, I'm already nervous. - Nothing to be nervous about. Your publicist and I have been chatting, and we were thinking how much amazing press you'd get if you reunited with Brad Love at your concert. - No. No way. - Now, wait, hear me out. What if you guys did a duet together? Maybe sing a classic Christmas song together. No, no, no, no. Brad and I are through. And I don't care how good the publicity is, it's not worth getting back together with your ex. I've had all I can take of ex-boyfriends. - What's that? - Ah, uh, nothing. What? Anyway, I don't know why you think Brad is so awful. I'm not just saying thisbecause you're both my clients, but you guys were really good together. Honestly, I don't even remember why you all broke up. Well, I-I never said he was awful. We broke up because Brad Love puts Brad Love first. All right, all right. I'll drop the Brad thing for now. No, no. Not-not for now. For always. Mm, maybe you'll change your mind. - Nope. Never gonna happen. - Never know. - Okay. Buh-bye, Carole. - Chat soon, Chrissy. - You seem kinda worked up today. - Yeah, I am! Carole called this morning trying to get me back together with my ex, which is the last thing I need after last night's dinner with Luke, who basically told me he thinks I'm a total fake, and then stormed out of his own restaurant. And now I'm marching through Cedar Pines, my hometown, that I haven't been back to in ten years, and honestly, it's all a little stressful. And that's why I have to buy that bicycle. - I'm sorry. What? - Because of Luke. Huh? You're scaring me. Luke said that I didn't know this town anymore. Probably couldn't even find it on a map, or something like that. Well, I'm gonna show him. I'm gonna get a bike and I'm gonna ride it down the dirt roads that I was raised on. - Makes sense now? - Yeah. When you explain it with a complete set of words and then put those words in a specific context, it makes perfect sense. No, not fair, you're not allowed to make me laugh when I'm upset. Too bad. Look, I know what Luke said was hard to hear. - But maybe he was right. - What does that mean? You haven't been back in ten years. Maybe you don't remember this place as well as you think you do. And I know it was hard for you to come back. But did you ever consider that this isn't so easy for Luke either? No. I didn't. Thank you, Eugene. Is this hat on too tight, or is that Chrissy Kessler? Bruce! Ah! - Hi! How are you? Oh. - Wonderful! Oh, shoot, I always knew you'd come home. - And isn't a second too soon. - Oh, my goodness! - I have missed you, Bruce. - I missed you, too. Oh, unbelievable, I was just coming by to buy a bike and ride around town today. No, you're not buying anything. We'll find something for you to ride. Just bring it back in one piece. - Are you sure? - Mm-hmm. Absolutely. - Wouldn't have it any other way. - Thank you. Uh, Chrissy, I think you have a stalker. Oh, no. This is my assistant, Eugene. Oh. It's a pleasure to meet you. And you as well. I've known this young lady since she was knee-high to a grasshopper. Chrissy would come every week with her dad, and while he was looking at camping gear, she would play with this old cat that liked to hang around the shop. A mean little tabby who liked to sass the customers. Sassed me once or twice, too, and I did not like it. Oh, I remember that cat. Anyway, that old cat will only let one person ever pet him. - And that was Chrissy. - That's right. I guess even a evil, mean, old, grumpy sourpuss knew a good egg when he saw one. - That's very sweet of ya, Bruce. - Well, it's true. Now, about that bike, I think I know the perfect one. Okay. - Bruce. - Good people. - Such good people. - Really good people. - Oh. Ahem. - Oh, wow. A reindeer bike. Just like your new song. - Wow! That is quite a bike. - Mm-hmm. Uh, oh, Chrissy, would you mind if I took Rudolph here for a spin? Oh. You know what? You go for it. - I'm-I'm gonna walk. - Oh, awesome. - Bruce, I'll see you later. - See ya. Okay. ♪ Can't you feel the rush? ♪ ♪ Out there's still cold and sets your cheeks aflush ♪ ♪ Look how the light's so bright you can't adjust ♪ ♪ Like breaking harmony ♪ ♪ The silver bells are ringing loudest ♪ ♪ Joyful tides among the crowds and ♪ ♪ Miracles will come on wings ♪ ♪ I can't wait for Christmas Day ♪ Chrissy? Oh, no. Oh. Ooh. Oh! Uh... - Wait, Chrissy, what are you... - I'm okay! All right, come inside. It's about to pour. God! Ah! Ahem. Tea? Appreciate that, but that's really not necessary. I won't be here much longer. I'm leaving as soon as this storm clears up. Well, I wouldn't hold your breath. Still no power and all the roads are washed out. I won't be able to drive you back to the lodge until tomorrow morning. Oh, just a nightmare. Ow. Well, this is lovely. So, you, uh, I don't know, wanna explain to me what you were doing out there or.. I don't know. I don't know. Oh, you know what, maybe it has something to do with that little rant of yours last night. Maybe I should have just left you out in the rain. Luke, you basically said I didn't belong here anymore, that I don't have the right to call this place home. You know what the worst part of all this is? You were right. You were right. I should have come back sooner. And I wish I hadn't stayed away for so long. Can I ask why you did? I mean, was it because you were ashamed of your hometown roots after you became famous? No, no. It's the exact opposite. Luke... Leaving Cedar Pines was one of the toughest decisions I've ever had to make. And I was afraid that if I came back, I just wouldn't have the strength to leave again. Um, I always wondered about that. Say, um, I told Brandon I would make Christmas cookies for him and his friends. He's sleeping at Pearl's house. And given we have nothing better to do, would you like to help me frost 'em, so I can surprise him when he gets here in the morning? Yeah. Sounds fun. - Great. Okay. - Okay. ♪ On the ground ♪ So you mentioned last night you were doing a concert here in town. - I am. - Well, that's exciting. Thanks. If I'm completely honest, I'm extremely stressed out about it. Yeah? Why is that? I released a song called Reindeer Slaay, and to say the least, it did not slay at all. Yeah. I, um, I keep up with your career. - You do? - Of course, I do. Ah, continue. Right. So I agreed to debut a new song at my concert. Problem is, all the songs that they've sent me aren't any good, and I'd rather write an original song. But truth be told, I have been off my game for quite some time now. - Three chords. - What? The key to writing a good song is three chords and the truth. Don't overthink it. I mean, Luke... you're brilliant. Thank you, but that was not mine. It is a famous quote... No, not that, when you said, "Don't overthink it," that's exactly what I'm doing, I'm over-thinking it. What are you getting at? I just mean there's no way I'm gonna be able to magically write a hit song in five days, because I'm way too in my head. And I don't want to debut a new song written by a stranger. - I just don't. - Yeah. ♪ We'll soon be home for Christmas ♪ What if you wrote a song with me? Oh, gosh! I-I don't, I don't... I don't know about that. Please. Please, Luke. This means everything to me. And you are the best songwriter I have ever met. Chrissy, I-I appreciate that, and I-I would help, but I don't even know if I know how to anymore. I mean, I can't even remember the last time I picked up a guitar. No time like the present. I'm sorry, Chrissy. Okay, okay, okay, listen. Do you remember when we were still gigging together? It didn't matter if they wanted to book us or not. You would do anything to get them to let us play. You know, and sometimes you would offer a trade. Like, in Lake City when you promised that we would bus tables for a week if they let us play three songs on stage? Ah... Okay. So? So you agree to write the song and I promise, I will do anything you want. I don't want anything, Chrissy. Uh... All right, maybe you don't want anything, but someone you know might. I do actually know someone who needs something. When you walked in that bar, Pearl lit up. You mean a lot to the people of this town, Chrissy. You're the one that made it. Every song you release, every video that premieres, everybody gets together every time to watch them. Um, yeah, I, uh, I didn't realize that. Anyways, Pearl asked me to host her annual Christmas Eve party. You know, she's slowing down a bit, so I told her I would help. I remember that party. No one throws a Christmas bash like your grandma. Nope. And she puts a lot of pride in that party. Yeah. The point is, I know how much it would mean to everyone to see you perform here again. And, oh, and if you sing at grandma's party, well, that would just about make her life. So if you want me to help you write this Christmas song... Consider it done. That was fast. You have yourself a deal. Oh. What have I done? - You're gonna love it. - Oh, man. Well, I'm exhausted. Yeah. Yeah, you read my mind. I'm tired, too. And I don't think you're getting out of here anytime soon. No. So why don't I make a bed on the couch and... - Well... - Yeah. Yeah, that's perfect. - Thank you. - Great. We'll clean this up in the morning. Yeah. I love leaving dishes for tomorrow. All right. - There you go. - Thanks. Mm. It's cozy. What? Oh. It's just been a while since I've seen you wrapped in that blanket. Yeah. I noticed you don't have many Christmas decorations up. You don't even have a tree. Yeah. Well... it's been a while since I've felt like celebrating Christmas, so... Right. All right. Goodnight, Chrissy. Goodnight, Luke. Hey. You must be Brandon. - Wait. Y-you know my name? - Y-you know what, you're good. You're good. Good with the syrup, good with the syrup. Uh, um, you know, I-I'm, like, your biggest fan. I-I love all your music. That so? Even Reindeer Slaay? Um, is that a trick question? You're funny! You know, I-I always suspected that I'm funny, so... - You're right. - Oh, wow. I see the two of you have already met. Uncle Luke, she thinks I'm funny. - Yeah. Yeah. Funny-looking. - No. - Can I make you some breakfast? - Yeah. Yeah. Oh, Uncle Luke, do you think she can come with us to buy the Christmas tree for your restaurant? Oh, bud, I'm sure she's got better things she needs to... I'm not busy. We don't start rehearsals again until tomorrow. Okay. Great. Perfect, and we'll pick up a tree for your place, too, while we're at it. - Sweet! - Oh. Two trees. Even better. Double the fun. Ha-ha, no, you're lying, Chrissy didn't actually get stuck at her ex-boyfriend's house. I swear. She had to spend the night and everything. Wow. You are never going to let her live this down, are you? Oh, honey. Never. I should probably go. Chrissy is here to buy a couple of Christmas trees. She'll need my help carrying them to the car. - Okay, go. Love you. - Love you, too. Well, let's just get one. - A tree is a tree, isn't it? - Ah, no. Okay, like, a spruce is not good for a Christmas tree. It just loses its shape too fast. But, like, this one, right here, this one's perfect. You cannot go wrong with a classic Fraser fir. Okay, okay. Great. We found our tree. Let's get it. All right. Brandon, what do you think? - Brandon? - Brandon? - Brandon? - Brandon! Oh, found him, Luke. - Hey. Hey. - Hey, Brandon. You gotta stay with us, bud. Oh. So who's the lady? Her name is Emily. Okay. All right. Are you gonna, you gonna talk to her? You're just gonna stand here and stare? - Can't talk. - Oh, come on. Just, just go up to her. You got this. Cannot talk. Okay. Well, now you sound like a robot. Okay. Come here. I'm gonna, I'm gonna help you out. - Come here. - What are you doing? So rule number one, if you want a girl to like you, she has to notice you first, right? And what is the best way to do that? Is dance. Hey, got anything funky? - I got you. - Okay. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about the moves. It's about confidence inside. Okay? Okay. Listen to the music. Feel it? Yeah? And... Yeah! You got it. You're better than-than you think you thought out to be. Come on, Brandon, show us what you got. Yes! Yes! Hey, thanks for helping Brandon out today. Aww. He's too cute. Little Casanova in training. I sure wish he'd slow down. Well, I'm not ready for him to grow up. Well, I think you got some time. He doesn't even know how to pour syrup over pancakes yet. - What's in the box? Hm. - Oh, yeah. This? It's a... You know, some stuff from back in the day. It's... Let's see here. We got... Oh. Tickets from our first concerts. What is that? - Wow! I have not seen this. - What is that? No... It's our Live At The Dockhouse flyer. Oh, look at the music notes we put on there. Oh, my...

Please, just, let me just say this once, okay, and then I'll never mention it again. ♪ What we don't have to say ♪ Okay. ♪ Yes ♪ Christmas morning, my parents surprised me with a gift. My mom was wiping away tears and I didn't understand why until I saw what she was holding. It was a one-way ticket to Nashville. And they were so happy for me. And I just, I just remember being so, so scared. I mean, that was everything I ever wanted. But you have no idea how terrifying a dream can be until you have the chance to chase it. And I remember, I sat there in my room for hours, and all I could think about was you. Not Nashville, not my dream... you. Luke, I wanted you to come with me, but you had already made it perfectly clear that you had no intention of ever leaving Cedar Pines. And I-I just knew, I knew that if I didn't break it off right then, I never would. I was, I was 28, and I felt like that this was my last chance, you know, to take my, take my shot. And all I could think to do at that time was write a note... and slip it under your door. And I knew that you would never ever call me 'cause you just said that if I ever chose to leave, that you wouldn't stop me. You have no idea how many times I reached for that phone to call you. I swear, I never meant to hurt you, especially on Christmas. I mean, our first kiss as teenagers was on Christmas Eve, Luke. You deserved so much better. I am very, very sorry. Oh. Well... I mean, if I'm being honest, I, I was hurt back then. That's okay. These past couple of days I have started to think about life back then through a different lens. How can I resent my past when you are my past, Chrissy? No. What do say we go back in time? Even if it's just for a night? ♪ Greatest moment here in time ♪ ♪ There ain't nothin' more to hide ♪ ♪ We can see it in our eyes ♪ ♪ What we don't have to say yeah ♪ ♪ Ah yeah ♪ ♪ What we don't have to say ♪ ♪ I'm not letting go this time ♪ ♪ And I'll be here tomorrow ♪ Hey, guys, before we get started... Um, you know, uh, when I made the decision to come back to Cedar Pines to do this concert, I knew that this spot was where I wanted to stage it. The very first time I played for an audience was right here on Main Street. Of course, back then I was the opening act at the Cedar Pines County Fair. Thank you very much. And I know it-it doesn't sound like much, but, uh, uh, I don't know, it felt like the opportunity of a lifetime. The point is I still feel that same way every single time I get to perform for a crowd whether big or small. So I just, I don't know, I just wanted you to try and think about that while we're rehearsing today. You know, this place is part of my story. All right. Let's do this. ♪ Dashing through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh ♪ ♪ O'er the fields we go laughing all the way ♪ ♪ Bells on bobtail ring ♪ More of it. Yeah. Yeah. There we go. Bye, guys. Thank you. - There she is. - Hi. Gingerbread latte from the Coffee Corner. Oh, you read my mind! Mm. Oh... Why is this still the best gingerbread latte in the world? Well, because it's locally-sourced farm-to-table gingerbread men... Stop it! Stop it! - Come on. - I didn't know this side of you. How, how were rehearsals? Ah, you know, they went as good as they could go, all things considered. I told you that we would get this song. Don't worry. I know, I know, but I am worried. Carole and the label are both losing patience. I don't know, Luke, if we don't come up with something quick, they're gonna make me sing those demos. Well... Oh. - That her? - Yeah. Relentless. You know, you don't need someone else calling the shots for you, because not only are you talented, you're also the smartest woman I know. You could easily be calling your own shots. Thank you, Luke. You know, that's exactly why we have to keep working on this song. Yes. Right after we get to work decorating the bar. - Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. - Brandon, Pearl already there. Oh. Let's pick the pace, then. Ah, we have a lot of work to do and exactly zero time. No time. Let's go. Just lettin' you know. - Hi. - Hi. Who's ready to decorate? I have been ready to decorate this place since May. Hey, Uncle Luke, Grandma Pearl said that I get to choose the music this time. All right, go for it, buddy. I already know what I'm playin'.

It all feels like junk, everything we've written. I feel like, like I'm letting you down. No, not everything is junk. I kinda liked the last song we came up with. What was that? When The Rooster Crows It's Christmas? When The Rooster Crows, It's Christmas. - Wait, what does that even mean? - I think it means... It's time to call it a night. Yeah. If that's not some kind of omen... No. Look, Chrissy, I... I don't know if I have it in me anymore. I mean, I-I know what I-I said, and I, and I meant it, but I don't see how we're gonna get this done in the next two days. Listen, you've written some really nice stuff, Luke. Don't flatter me. It's not gonna work. I'm not. It's in there. It is. Maybe. But you're right. It's kinda gettin' late. We both need to rest up for the big party tomorrow. Oh, by the way, can you check on Pearl and make sure she's got her snow tires on? I hear we're supposed to get the first heavy snow of the season tomorrow, just in time for Christmas Eve. Hey, don't worry about it. You're off the hook. I couldn't help you write your song, so you don't have to play at the party. - Deal's a deal. - What deal? Song or no song, I will be there. You know you're stuck with me now, Luke. Thank you, Chrissy. Don't mention it. Besides, I already promised Pearl I'd stay and guard while she spiked the eggnog. Oh, boy. Well, seein' you there tomorrow is gonna mean a whole lot to those folks.

Well, thank you. I, uh, just... After you left last night, I, uh, started to think about us, and, uh, and it hit me. I knew exactly what this song was always meant to be about. You wrote the song? Yeah. Well, couple of verses and the chorus. - But.. - All right. Okay, okay. Let's hear it. It's been a while. Been a little rusty. But thank goodness I have my lucky pick. Yeah.

Yeah, kinda. Ah, uh, Luke. Brad Love. Didn't ever think I'd be meeting you like this. I know. It can be disorienting to meet a celebrity. But I'll let you in on our little secret. We're just people. That's not what I meant, but... - Thanks. Um... - Babe. You have no idea how happy I am to see you. You know how crazy the weather is out there? Brad Love really made it through that blizzard, but luckily for him, a fearless local agreed to drive him over here. Does he always refer to himself in the third person? No, but sometimes I say my own name in a sentence. My name is my brand. Babe. - Let's grab a drink. - Hm. There is so much I wanna tell you. Brad. Do you mind giving us a second to talk? Yeah. No, take, take all the time you want. I'm out of here. - Wait, Luke, don't leave. - Just turn the lights off. - When you're done. - No, wait! Wait! Do you mind telling me what the heck is going on? I've been trying to get a hold of you for days. I've been busy. Okay. This taken? Go for it. Who was that? I'd rather not talk about him. Of course. I really didn't mean to intrude. The woman checking me in at the lodge told me I could probably find you here, I guess there was supposed to be some kind of Christmas party tonight. Yeah. Supposed to be. Anyway, sorry if I got in the way of something. Brad, what is this all about? Carole is worried about the concert. She flew me out because she wanted me to come talk to you about doing the duet, I think it could be really good for both of our careers. I didn't expect you to be caught so off-guard. Carole told me she already mentioned the possibility of a duet to you. Yeah, she did pitch me the idea and I turned her down. I didn't realize that. Yeah, well, like you said, she's worried. Well, for whatever it's worth, I want you to know I was excited by the idea of doing a duet with you. Well, maybe sometime in the future we can collaborate again on something, but not for a while. I don't want our fans to get the wrong idea. Makes sense. - Okay. - Okay. Well, that's that. I'll fly back to Nashville as soon as this storm passes. Okay. Better get back to the lodge and start packing the suitcase I've barely begun unpacking. Uh, is your ride still here? Oh, yes. I was telling you before. Local guy with his own truck. Not only fearless in a storm, but maybe the nicest guy I've ever met. Yeah. That's Cedar Pines. Ah, well, actually, uh, my ride left. Shoot, look at me offering a ride home to another guy's date. And if that wasn't already a trip, I'm being asked by my ex-girlfriend. Sounds like a good premise for a song. It does, doesn't it? - You ready? - After you. ♪ Joy to the earth the Savior reigns ♪ Why do you insist on mauling your presents like some sort of feral coyote? - What? - Well, what do you got there? Christmas ties! - Thanks, Uncle Luke. - You're welcome, bud. That's the tenth time she's called. - I don't care. - Honey... Why don't you go and try on one of those? - But which one? - Um... - The gingerbread one. - That's what I was thinking. Uh, you know he doesn't know how to tie a tie. - He's gonna be in there forever. - And that's the point. We need to talk. I'm gonna go make some coffee. Would you like some? Stop right there, mister. There's nothing to say, grandma. Oh, you bet there is. Now, you've had a wall up for some time now, and I was just starting to see that wall come down. Don't push her away. - Look, I know you like her... - Hush! I am tired of this pity party that you've got goin' here. Well, it's not a pity party. I mean, parties are supposed to be fun. I heard that. Let me ask you this, do you think it was Chrissy's idea to invite that man to town? Well, I mean, she did text me and say that it was her manager's idea to invite him. And do you believe her? That's not the point. Well, then exactly what is the point? I started to think that things might actually work out. You know, these past couple of days it, it began to feel like no time had passed at all. It was almost as if Nashville never happened. Yeah, well, Brad walked in and sobered me up real quick. I felt like such a chump, grandma. How could I let myself forget that Brad, this concert, her career, that's Chrissy's real life? Not me. - You don't know that. - Yes, I do. I do know it because all I am to her is some old yearbook. Sure, it's fun to flip through the pages and relive the simpler times. But that's only exciting for so long. I mean, it's not as if I expected Chrissy to just leave Nashville and come and settle down with me here in Cedar Pines and... Truth is, I didn't think about how this would work out because deep down... I think I was afraid of what the answer would be. Well, you're right about one thing. You are a chump. Right. Now, Luke, you don't get to make the rules. All these years you've held on to this grudge, like, Chrissy leaving to go and do exactly what she was meant to do was some kind of personal affront to Luke Convington. Well, it isn't. Now, I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. What you decide is your own business. But if you choose to do nothing at all, then that's exactly what you're gonna get in return. Do you hear me? Yes, ma'am. I love you, kid. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, I love you, too, grandma. Thank you. Wow, this blue is gorgeous. This one. - This one is perfect. Thank you. - Okay. - Busy morning. - Hey. - Are you excited for tonight? - I will be, yeah. I'm just distracted. I... I just wish things with Luke didn't turn out the way that they did. I know, if there's anything I can do for you, let me know. No, there's nothing you can do for me, but I may have done a little something for you. Huh? Turn around. Turn around. Oh! I mean... I... Well, how did you... Uh, I mean, I'm speechless. Chrissy actually called Lois and convinced her to give me a couple of days off. It-it helps when your boss is a huge fan of your husband's boss. I started to realize just how fast the years go by. Figured five Christmases away from the one you love was a streak that needed breaking. You're the best friend ever. No. You are. - It's so good to see you. - It's so good to see you. Mitchell, I was so afraid you weren't gonna get in 'cause of that storm. You and me both. It was crazy. So what's it been like being back home? Um, bittersweet. I mean, on one hand it has been amazing. I didn't know how much I miss this place until I came home. But, um, you know, just there's so many more people I wish I would've gotten to see. Just wish I had a little more time. Well... You okay, Chrissy? Yeah. Sorry, I'm just gonna take a second. Okay. I'll go get settled in the room. - I'll see you in a bit. - Okay. I am so sorry. I did not mean to ruin that moment. I, uh, I guess, until now I hadn't really processed the fact that I'm gonna have to leave this place soon. I mean, so much has happened, I don't, I don't know, it, it's, um, it's difficult to put into words. You don't have to. I know. Look, we've been close for a long time. And I thought I knew everything there was to know about you. But when I saw the way you looked at Luke, I realized I was only getting half the story. But if I know anything about you, I know that you're not gonna let Luke get the final word. Oh, you are so right. I have a crazy idea, and if we hurry, I think there's still enough time that we can pull this off. I like where this is going. But before we go, there's someone I need to talk to. I-it's an ambush! Everybody retreat! Retreat! Retreat, retreat, retreat! Brandon. Chrissy, you made me lose my game. Oh, I'm sorry, I just needed to get a hold of you and I didn't know of any other way. Why didn't you just call the house? - Oh. - Or even my cell. Wait, why does a ten-year-old have a cell phone? Every ten-year-old has a cell phone. Wow! That's a lot to unpack right now. Okay. So I need you to help me do something. Remember when I helped you get the girl? Yeah. Well, now I need you to help me get the boy. Oh, get up. Get up. - We gotta go right away. - Is everything okay? I found this note on Brandon's door. He snuck out to go to Chrissy's concert. - What? Okay, come on. Let's go. - I'll drive. Okay, okay. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Oh, that kid! What are we doing here? We need to get to the concert. - And find Brandon. - Brandon is fine. Well, how would you know that? Well, what's goin' on? Grandma, please, what... What are we doing here? Uh... Well, what are you, what are you doing here? You honored your end of the deal. I thought I better do the same. But the concert? I'm, I'm confused. No. Just tweeted out a change of venue. I didn't see any reason why we couldn't do a concert and a Christmas party at the same time. Of course you did. Look... I'm really, really sorry I walked out on you last night. Thank you. I also didn't hold up my end of the bargain. I never finished your song. Luke, what you wrote was beautiful. And, and without even knowing it... you gave me the ending. - I don't understand. - You were my first kiss, Luke. And I was yours. The past is where we started. We're making new memories now. You're not just my past. Luke, you are my past and my present and my whole future. Oh, Chrissy... I don't know what to say. Say you'll get on stage and play that song with me. I'd love to. Let's do this. You ready? Ready. Hello, Cedar Pines! It has been incredible to be here with you this last week.
