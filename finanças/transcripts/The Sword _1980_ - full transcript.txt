The Imperial Court, therefore, ordered the release of the Shaolin disciples. Arrival of Imperial Edict! [IMPERIAL EDICT] By the Mandate of Heaven, the Emperor decrees: Commander of the Two Expanses, Ko Chun-Chung, will execute with immediacy these imperial orders by method of his own discretion. The previous dynasty's sanction on the restoration of the Shaolin Temple has now been lifted and restoration is permitted. Furthermore, of the rebels who conspired a coup, batches one and two of these ethnic Han criminals will be released. Observe the sentiment of the people; do not betray my intentions. This, the will of the Emperor, shall be done! [BY IMPERIAL DECREE, HAN PRISONERS TO BE RELEASED] Hey, look at this! - Come take a look! - Look! Wu Ah-Biu? [WHITE LOTUS MONASTERY] My lord. Arrival of his excellency, the Provincial Commander! Arrival of his excellency, the Provincial Commander! - My lord. - Where is Martial Uncle? Upstairs. [SCRIPTURE PAVILION] [WHITE LOTUS MAIN ALTAR] [WHITE LOTUS] What do you want from me? I bow in greeting, Martial Uncle. Martial Uncle, you have to help me this time. The Emperor has ordered the release of the Shaolin followers. Moreover, they are permitted to restore Shaolin. With this... I will not be able to avenge Master White Brows. I hope Martial Uncle will lend me his strength, and send some men to exterminate these Shaolin dregs in secret. Otherwise, their momentum will only continue to grow. This heralds disaster for the White Lotus and for you, Martial Uncle. Sister-in-law Biu! Siu-Ching! Hey, the government's releasing prisoners. Sister-in-law Biu...! Sister-in-law Biu. Man-Ting, such familiarity even though I'm not married yet. What is it? Why were you causing a ruckus out there? Sister-in-law Biu, the government's releasing prisoners. - Releasing prisoners? - That's right. - What about my brother, then?! They'll be letting him go, of course. How wonderful! - I'd never have thought... - I can see my family again! What luck! I'd never have guessed I'd live to go home. Brother Tong? Just let me down over there. Alright, easy now. Thank you. Brother Tong, let's part ways here. My home's just beneath the foot of the mountain. You should all be on your way too. Don't worry about me. Brother Biu, it was so we'd all be spared that those lap dogs tormented you so... We have to see you home safely. That's right! What he said! Actually... they already knew it was Hung Man-Ting and I who killed Bak Mei the Taoist. They had a grudge to bear. So they took this opportunity to cripple me. It had nothing to do with you. Brother Biu, you lost your leg in order to save all of us. Just say the word, and we'll be there! When my leg recovers, I will definitely join your cause, and exterminate these inhumane lap dogs! Brother Biu, let us part ways here, then. Take good care of yourself. We'll meet again! We'll meet again! Sister-in-law Biu, are you alright? - I'm alright. - Let's hurry up, then. - Brother Biu! - Big Brother! Brother Biu...! I'll be a dad soon. Brother Biu, your leg...? My leg is fine. Let's go home first. - Brother Biu. Here, let's go. - Big Brother. Alright, then. Let's go home. We're really lucky this time, huh? I haven't seen my family in so long! I never thought I'd live to go home! Die! Die! They all carked it... Hey! Did you see Wu Ah-Biu?! Didn't see him! Come. Come. Drink. - Cheers! - Drink. Drink. - Cheers. - Cheers. Cheers... Brother Biu. What a blessing that we can be together as a family. Brother Biu? You and Sister-in-law can share the joy of being a family now. But as for Siu-Ching and I... Man-Ting, you can rest assured. Siu-Ching is all grown up now. Brother Biu will make arrangements, of course. As soon as we become husband and wife, we'll all be family. Brother Biu can't use his leg. And you're now with child. Siu-Ching and I can give you a hand. Siu-Ching? Let's drink to Brother and Sister-in-law Biu. Drink. Siu-Ching, go back to your room. - Brother Biu... - Who are you looking for?! Little Sister, be careful of the flames! Hurry up, let's help! Sister-in-law! Wu's Junior, we'll save you! Martial Brother Wu, what's going on here?! The Imperial Court must've sent them to eliminate us! The Qing Court is so unjust... We'll take their lives! - Sister-in-law! - Mei-Ha, are you hurt?! Brother Biu... I'm fine... Little Sister, take care of Sister-in-law. We'll retreat as we fight! Siu-Ching, we'll go inside and pack some clothes... Halt! [WHITE LOTUS] Oh... so it's the White Lotus Sect's hermetic Taoist Master White Lotus! Taoist Master White Lotus, there have never been grievances between Shaolin and the White Lotus. Why have you attacked us?! Have the two of you forgotten that you killed my junior, Taoist White Brows? Oh... I understand now. So it was Ko Chun-Chung who incited you to come here! Enough talk. Wu Ah-Biu. Hung Man-Ting. I, Taoist White Lotus, have come here today to experience your abilities for myself. Fine, I'll teach you, then! Brother Biu, you can't use your leg. Leave him to me! Your Shaolin blade is only good for gutting fish. Actually, who needs a blade to finish off you people? You really want to run off that badly, huh? I'll let you take seven steps. Run. Run. Run. Run. Run. Run... One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Brother Biu! Tiger and Crane Double Form! Leave it to me! Tiger and Crane Cry Together. My leg can't keep up! Take Sister-in-law and run! Brother Biu, you-- Why are you still here?! Wipe out every last one of them! Take that! Your crippled crane can only peck at dead fish and dead prawns. Your Shaolin Fist can't even touch my clothes. How pathetic! Brother Biu! Brother Biu...! Big Brother...! Why are you still here?! Take Sister-in-law and go, now! Siu-Ching, you-- Don't worry about me. I have to avenge my brother! Siu-Ching! Why are you still here?! Little girl... where have they gone? In here! Leave no stone unturned! Sister-in-law Biu, I'm worried about Siu-Ching. Why don't we head home and check up on her? They have strength in numbers... Siu-Ching will have more trouble than fortune. How about we lay low for now, work out what to do later? In that case... Where can we hide? I have a relative in Wai On Town. Let's ask them for help. Alright. Here. [WHITE LOTUS MAIN ALTAR] - Drink. - Martial Uncle. Come, come, come. Let us drink. Martial Uncle, I raise my glass to you. - Come, come, come. - Drink. It was only with Martial Uncle's support that we could accomplish our plan. Most unfortunate though... that Hung Man-Ting managed to escape. Tiger and Crane Double Form is absolutely nothing to me. What's more, the crippled crane is now dead. Nevertheless, your dead master, my junior, White Brows, has been properly avenged. The Master's words ring true. Martial Uncle, I fear those surviving dregs will... Put your mind at ease. Hung Man-Ting has the same temperament as his father, Hung Hei-Gun. Sooner or later, he'll come personally knocking on death's door. Keep with our original plan, and continue the extermination of the Shaolin disciples! Understood. [SHAOLIN TEMPLE RESTORATION RECRUITMENT STATION] - Thank you, kind patron... - I'm here to help. Amitabha. Amitabha. Amitabha. Over here! Put it over there! Over there! [SHAOLIN TEMPLE] - This Emperor's pretty good. - Yeah! - He let us go, and is letting us rebuild the Shaolin Temple. What was that? - Bring the bricks over here! - Thank you, kind patron. There are more people coming to help. [RESTORATION] Thank you, kind patron. Please sign your name first. No need! We're all friends here! You can find tools over there. No... No need! We've brought our own. The two of you are not helping? Alright. Alright. Alright... Over here. Clear it out. You are...? Die! Die...! Die! Die! Let's go! [WAI ON TOWN] Knife and scissor sharpening! It's alright if you don't buy... - It's cheap, it's high quality! - Knife and... Man-Ting? Why don't we ask someone? - Shopkeeper? - Y-Yes? What can I get you? I've heard there's a papercraft shop in this town... Oh...! You want a papercraft shop, is that it? There... it's the one over there. [PAK CHEUNG PAPERCRAFT SHOP] Ah... Madam, what can I get for you? We're not here to shop. May I ask if Wu Nai-Shing is in? Wu Nai-Shing...? There's nobody named Wu here. His face is kind of skinny... He's got some scabies on his head. Oh, Shing! Papercraft Shing, right? - Yes! - I'll tell him to come out. Shing! Papercraft Shing...! Shing! Get out here! What a damn racket... What the hell's going on...? - Do you have to be so loud? - There's someone looking for you! Oh, Sister-in-law. Brother Shing. How nice of you to visit me. Where's Brother Biu? We're in a spot of trouble. We want to stay here for a few days. And this is...? This is Brother Biu's martial arts brother, Hung Man-Ting. Brother Shing. Oh...! So this is the Hung Man-Ting who killed Taoist White Brows! Brother Biu told me all about it. Brother Shing? Let's not talk now. - Take us inside first. - Oh... sure! Follow me. Come over here. Over here. Come in. - Take a seat, Man-Ting. - Alright. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Brother Shing. So, Sister-in-law? Just what's happened to Brother Biu? It's like this. Brother Biu and Siu-Ching... They've both been killed by the Taoist Master White Lotus. All the other released anti-Qing patriots... have met the same fate. It's all just destiny. I told him right from the start not to practise kung fu... Join up with those unions or whatever. Sister-in-law? Don't be sad. Your health is important. You two stay here for now. Man-Ting can give me a hand with work. I manage things out here. I just have to let the owner know when he's back. - Thank you. - Thank you, Brother Shing. We're all family, let's stop talking about bad things. Ah, right... Sister-in-law? I'm going to take Man-Ting over to the other room. Man-Ting? You can sleep on my bed. Help me tidy up over there. I'll go fetch a bed board. Man-Ting? Not so hard. You have to be gentle when bending it. Taoist Master White Lotus...! Crane's beak? If we take Brother Biu's Crane Form Fist, combine it with my Tiger Form Fist, it can become Tiger and Crane Double Form. With this... the White Lotus can be defeated! Man-Ting? Have some tea. - Have some tea. - Thank you. Brother Shing? For as long as I've been here... you've taken good care of me. Don't say stuff like that! But... I do have a request. What kind of request? I hope that during my training... you'll stand-in for Brother Biu's Crane Form Fist. No way! I might've learnt a bit with Brother Biu when I was a kid, but for as long as I've worked here, I haven't even raised a fist. I've forgotten it all! Don't worry. I've more or less mastered Brother Biu's Crane Form Fist already. You just have to be willing to learn. Well... Well, do you want revenge? Revenge? Well, of course I do! It's settled, then. Starting from today, you and I will practise Tiger and Crane Double Form. Come on! Awesome, huh? Let's keep going! This is my big brother Biu's Crane Pecks at Prawn. It's something, huh? Tiger and Crane Advance! Back in the day, Taoist White Brows met his end at Brother Biu's and my Tiger and Crane Double Form! Tiger Crouches, Crane Cries! Digging Sand, Crane Wings! Hung Man-Ting, Tiger and Crane Double Stop! You want to stop? We can't. Get up. Brother Shing, you have to treat this as that Taoist White Lotus. Treat this as that Taoist White Lotus. Crane beak! Crane beak beak beak beak beak... - It really hurts...! - Tiger and Crane Cry Together! Hey! I'm not Taoist White Lotus! White Crane's Head Descends! I've turned into... Taoist White Crane now...! Brother Shing, keep going. I'm finished... Hey! It's not covered, I'll die! Hey! I still need that! There's still more? Brother Shing, how's my kung fu? Powerful enough. Fast enough. Much better than when you were training with me. For the sake of defeating the White Lotus, I have to painstakingly practise Tiger Crane Double Form. Man-Ting. Your Tiger and Crane Double Form isn't bad, of course... However... it won't be that easy to defeat the White Lotus. How can I endure the shame of being left alive? For the sake of Brother Biu, Siu-Ching, and all the anti-Qing patriots. For them, I must have revenge! Kind patron, may I ask who you are looking for? I am Hung Man-Ting. I'm here for White Lotus! Kind patron, perhaps you should come back another day. The Master is not seeing guests today. He won't see me, but I'll see him! Hung Man-Ting is coming...! Hung Man-Ting is coming...! Hung Man-Ting is coming...! Taoist White Lotus! Taoist White Lotus! Hung Man-Ting. Ko Chun-Chung, the Imperial Court has already reconciled with Shaolin! - But you! - But my master has not been avenged! Martial Brother Wu Ah-Biu and I are responsible for White Brows' death! But you colluded with the White Lotus Sect, murdering the Shaolin disciples freed by the Imperial Court. I've come here today to vanquish you and Taoist White Lotus! Martial Uncle was right. Sooner or later, you'll come personally knocking on death's door. You coordinate your Tiger and Crane Double Form with speed. [LOTUS GARDEN] Hung Man-Ting's out there! What is all the commotion outside? Report, Master: Hung Man-Ting is here. Hung Man-Ting? Ko Chun-Chung! Leave it to me. Understood. Taoist White Lotus! Hung Man-Ting, today is the Tuen Ng Festival. An auspicious day of cleansing and purification according to the Tao. Originally, I was to refrain from taking any lives. But you came all this way! I'm here to send you to the Dragon King! You're using dead Wu Ah-Biu's Crippled Crane Form. Turns out you're quite smart. Your Tiger and Crane Double Form has little effect on me. That's still not good enough. You think you're still a child and want a piggyback? Hung Man-Ting! How can your half-arsed Tiger and Crane Double Form be worthy of even coming near me? Don't even think about it. You'll only ever be good enough if you join that damned Wu Ah-Biu in Hell. After him! Chun-Chung! Do not give chase! - Martial Uncle. - Send men in pursuit. We'll get him in one fell swoop! Come and shop here! Buy something. Have a look around. It's high quality. Choose whatever you like. Buy something, mister! Feel free to browse. Thank you for your custom. We have tables inside. Table for two? If you're here for tea, please come in. Table for two? There are tables over there. We're looking for someone. Oh? Feel free to look, then. What is it? Did you see a young man wearing beige come in here? Oh...! He just started working here. It's the one who greeted you at the door. Damn! We got tricked. After him! How is it? Man-Ting, Sister-in-law's already given birth. You're only bringing the boiled water now? Just look at you... You've even got your shirt on inside-out! I... Congratulations. Congratulations... Is it a boy or a girl? Congratulations to you! She's given birth to a big fat boy! I'm not... Your wife's body is very weak. Remember, more nutritious stews for her. I have something to do. I'll come back tomorrow. H-h-hey...! Man-Ting? Where did you go on the day I gave birth? Brother Shing couldn't even ask you for help. - I... - I'll do the talking. Sister-in-law? Man-Ting refused to tell you this whole time
