Well, I would like to ask you András Kovács, why are they making a movie about me when it would be more interesting and I think people would be more interested in a movie about my husband. Because he had such a life which cannot be compared with others who lived in this century. Madame President, your life was so intertwined so this movie will be focused on Mihály Károlyi just like on Katinka Andrássy. Now I would like you to talk about your younger years first and about the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. Well, we thought the Monarchy is something that lasts forever and what my grandfather created and something that... that cannot be changed. There was a great admiration to our grandfather. There was a lot of talk on him in the family. We talked. He was on very good terms with Ferenc Deák and the entire Agreement with the Monarchy was created by them. Also to have József Ferenc as the Hungarian king and Austrian emperor. It was a very complicated task. So he crowned him, put the crown on the king's head. And I know that once I said something... I said something critical about him and about my uncle at Vác, and one of my cousins slapped me that even today I remember how upset he was. How can I criticize these people? They were like gods to them. They were like gods to them. Most of us never thinks about war It always seemed like the Monarchy will never change. Everything will continue as it is. My foster father was the brother of my father who died early. Gyula Andrássy Jr. whom we called Uncle Duci. He wanted to follow in my grandfather's footsteps. He was an absolute supporter of the Monarchy, even if he couldn't pull it completely himself off from the traditional anti-Habsburg mentality of the Hungarians. He politicized as a moderate oppositionist. I was more radical. I hated the Habsburgs. I wanted to show it at a ball to royal prince József. Would you mind to come here please? Others were opposing. I'll not salute to a Habsburg. Don't refer to Károlyi, he is an eccentric. He hardly noticed anything of it. Many things hurt my sense of justice. My mother's strict educational principles, the hard punishments for my stubbornness, the bigoted discipline of the convent school. Although I didn't knew too much about social injustice. It was natural for me that aristocracy runs the country. Who else could run it anyway? We lived in isolation, the close family. My mother, my foster father, my sisters, Ilona, Boji, their husbands and my sister Kája. Who was my best friend for a long time and my only confidant. Travels, balls, hospitality they made our lives. And hunts I hated because of their cruelty. THE RED COUNTESS Based upon the memoirs, letters and words by Mihályné Károlyi written by: Music by Starring Director of Photography Directed by What? Why are you giggling? This is really bad manners. Look at the newspapers. It's outrageous. Thank you. - What do you order, countess majesty? - Yes, what the others have. The Eiffel Tower will be demolished so I thought I would climb to the top. What a building! My French friends also hate this Tour Eiffel. - It's not Effel but Eiffel. - You know everything better. Yes, but if you were in France, then you could hear it yourself. - That's what the French say. - Let's bet! Though it's not fair in an obvious matter. Not modest at all. - I could say the same about you. - Katus is right. Of course, women are always right. May I ask you not to swing the boat? May I ask you to keep it direction? I can't keep it like this. I will be soaking wet. Let's go there! There is a good port. Don't point your finger but try to row together. - Katus, the water is very cold. - No problem. Katus! Katus! What happened? - Where is she going? - Home. - Like this? - Yes. - I'm going too. - I cannot make a joke on you? Have fun! You should get dressed. What happened? - What is your problem? - Nothing. Nothing happened. - Did Gyula hurt you? - No no. It's my fault. - I don't understand what. - Forget it! I feel ashamed. Should I swear I won't tell to anyone? I'm in love with Gyula. But you can't stand each other. Love with Gyula. Ridiculous, right? And does Gyula know about this? It's hopeless as he is the fiancee of my niece. There was example that an engagement broke. You just don't think that I would marry such a jerk. Then why do you say that you are in love with him? Because I'm. Don't you understand? Now. When the castle is full of guests. What kind of reputation will it have? I kiss your hand! Please have the spaletta! Running through the park in a bathing suit... As if you not live in this world. Like a lunatic. Why don't you answer? You are not present? I felt my mother was right. I'm a human without proper behavior and will. I don't have enough strength to defeat a humiliating passion. I have been such a miserable state of mind for months now that it only strengthened me the slowly developing conviction. There was only decent solution for me was to end my life. What's the weather like today? It's a heat wave, your majesty. Heat wave?! Where's my hairpin? Go back, look for it! Here it is, your majesty. Well, thank you. So? Did you finally come to your senses? Hm? My God, what did you do? Countess, can you hear me? Do you feel pain? Nothing wrong. Here is the guilty one. I hope it doesn't happen again playing with dangerous things. What a tiny ball. It slipped along one of the ribs like on a rail. It got almost under the skin. You need rest. - Is she in life-threatening condition? - What was the reason for the suicide? Gentlemen, I can only repeat what I said, it was an accident. - Who was she in love with? - Understand, there is no secret, which I can tell you. Why are you asking me? Who will marry you after all this? Why wouldn't they? They will spread that you followed the Roman Lucretia. That you killed yourself in shame, because the lost of innocence. - Come on, mom! - Who needs a girl like that? I didn't lose it. Who thinks of Lucrecia after two thousand years? - Just don't laugh at Lukrécia! - Ouch! She deserves more respect. Then I will be more respected. Can't take yourself seriously. It is not customary in our circles to commit suicide. This is done by broke traders. If you wanted to die so bad, why didn't you rent a plane? You could jump out high up there from it. That's the minimum. But so?! You chose the civil way of suicide. This is not appropriate. Here, your majesty. Now you can go. It's nice here in the cool. If you are watching over me not to commit the same mistake again then you wast your time here. We are not watching over you. This is Ilona's weakness: the poultry yard. Eat this! Italians are so cheerful because they always eat macaroni. Enjoy your meal! Katus! You need to figure out how to stand your place in the world as a woman. - Interested? - I'm listening. Never discuss books with men or abstract questions. Limit yourself for light chats. Because men don't like smart women. Even you? It's not about me. Try to be more naive, to appear mentally lower class against the man whom wants to conquer. You are wrong. I only want to love someone who is better than me. Someone I can admire. And if I can't find one then I would never get married. I really regret now that I didn't graduate. I can't go to university. Whatever, I'll finish a course anyway. Why do you need a course? Don't ask that, you're working yourself. She loves her animals. That's a different thing. That's entertainment. But working for money? What is it for you? To make myself independent from men. With work? After all, your only estate is worth more, than you could earn in your entire life. No I have already decided. Forty-four thousand crowns for six years with an interest rate of five percent. - Two R Pi. - Circular area? A square of Pi. Deltoid area? E x F/2. District? The pledge letter is like an interest-bearing bond, which the authorized institute... What institute is that? Katus, can I read an article? It's about you. About me? Question: Tell me, Mr. El Can, is it worth twenty thousand crowns a year to pay a beginner accountant? Answer: If this beginner accountant is named Gróf Katinka Andrássy it would be such a sensation that... I can't believe it, you made it up. Has the contract been signed yet? Why didn't you started? Come on! What happened now? Cheeky merchant declared to sign me as an accountant. You learned that, didn't you? Yes, but I want to work. But this man want to make me a promotional figure. Come on, what does a trader do? Making tricks. Uncle Duci has no idea how much calculation needed by a shop owner. I suspect that I will never learn this. Countess, I would be happy to publish an interview as an answer to this. Good but not as an answer. We don't even notice this impudence. Countess I would be more interested of the emotional motivation of this extraordinary decision. Leave me alone with love stories. There isn't and never will be. Show me one man whom I could take as my husband! What husband. With whom I can talk five minutes without yawning! - Come on, let's take them one by one! - No, God forbid! So, Countess, I can write that your disappointment in men led to this decision? A hopeless undertaking. Let's stop, shall we? Goodbye! - Hello. - Welcome. Finally here. Gentlemen, make yourself at home! Please go to the salon! I heard some strange news from Pest. One moment, sorry. What is in that law suggestion presented by Tisza... Yes, yes, but if we allow them, we will be in trouble... We must stay strong otherwise everything falls apart. We even can't vote the increasing the military budget. This leads to war. We can accept it with certain conditions. Such a small country cannot afford arming. The Monarchy is a 50 million superpower. Hungary is a country of 20 million poor people. We need to be stronger economically if we want to survive. Yes, I'm coming. - Katus, aren't we going for a drive? - Of course. - Is it broken? - I don't like something. Shouldn't we try it? Yes, we can go, countess. - But only if I can drive. - Only if you don't tell anyone. I'm driving now! Please, madam. Would you please change the speed there. That's it. Would you please on the left. Now the right. Right please. What do they think of us? Is everything possible today? - Of course I fired him. - Who did you fire? A film producer. He wants to make a movie about aristocrats and of course, to be a sensation he wants to cast a real aristocrat. It doesn't matter if it's me or someone else, the idea itself is cheeky. - Why? - How why? Katus would accept to make pictures of her in company of ordinary actors? Katus? She even became accountant at the El Can brothers. - Why not? - Not a word of it is true! This is an insult! Name your assistants! Mine: Count László Széchenyi, and Gróf Mihály Károlyi. Gentlemen, don't be fooled, that my opponent is wearing a skirt. She actually has manly ambitions. Because I want to work as an ordinary man? For accounting, gentlemen? Yes, for accounting. There are more interesting professions than accounting. What do you know about it? A profession? I'm not going to ask you. I don't think it's to blame, if someone wants to work. Sorry if my comment was misunderstood. The only question is what do we call work. Let's say to own 10-20 thousand acres. Or, like you, even more. Isn't that work? I'm not exhausted of it to be honest. - And I see you don't either. - Why? To look at the nails of property managers, negotiate with tenants, to outsmart lawyers, feed thousands, isn't that work? In our family Károlyi was considered a political opponent. As he wanted completely transform the Monarchy, my grandfather's work. I saw the politics through the glasses of my family. However after a few conversations I felt disagreements don't matter. We both of us will agree in real important issues together with Mihály. All I cared about he was also interested. And made me curious about many things, which I did not deal with until then. Besides, it's not even sure the next decades they will know the concept of landowner. My mother is not against me working. Mom always hated being idle. But if they objected, it wouldn't bother me either. Join them! I hate this carnage. I'd rather go back to the forest. I'll go with you. I only care about riding in fox hunting. It was like a serenity I felt beside Mihály. The opposite of my restless and confusing life. For the first time I felt that there was someone who understood me. Pull it! Pull it! Pull it! Pull it! - Why isn't it pulled by horses? - Because it's cheaper like this. Pull it! Pull it! Pull it! Pull it! There was not a single word said between us about love. But I knew I found the man I was looking for so much. Someone I can look up to. Let me adjust your belt. I see you're having a good time. Very pretty. Katus, listen! Adjust your hair! There, in the back. - Who is next in the dance order? - I don't make commitments. I wouldn't do so if I were you. I'm so happy. I think Mihály's negotiations with Uncle Duci multiplied because of you. I hope so. Also yesterday, when Uncle Duci came, then Mihály... You promised me this waltz. May I have this waltz? May I? More recently, my middle daughter likes to play the piano very much. Madeleine teaches her, but she also has a teacher. Madeleine plays very well. And actually when... - We used to dance a long ago. - Not so long ago. You're getting jealous, darling. Could be. - Ella, darling. - Madeleine! I envy you your beautiful daughters. God, how time flies. They were just children a few years ago. They are still children I think. You shouldn't say that at their age. - Did you get the invitation? - Yes, thank you. Oh, I'm so hot. I'm looking for something refreshing. - Mihály, will you accompany me? - Of course. Excuse me. Be careful not to be in love! You had trouble with Gyula as well. How can you compare Gyula to Mihály? You know, I found out that Madeleine has been Mihály's lover for ten years. He didn't married her for ten years, why would he marry her now? Well, if it was good for him for ten years, then it may take another ten. That means Mihály not only smart but also loyal. That's nice of a man, isn't it? You cannot be saved. Aha. Ady. - Shall we make a parody of it? - You cannot parodize it. Listen! "Since it was good in myself for myself and with myself to live, But this happiness would be so nice to switch." At the end: Oh, how I wish to desire but not with obsession whom just for minute but with obsession can be hibernated for eternal." It's as if Ady didn't write it. These cars are horrible. It's a shame to have a car where the roads are so bad. Poor Mihály! Poor Katus! If not destroyed, he would have been my husband. What makes you think he would marry you? Mom, please. He was the only man that I could have loved. What do you know what men are like. Mihály was the best prospective husband in Hungary. But he never wanted to get married. Madeleine chained him to herself too much. Mama, you're talking about a dead person. Wait, wait. This part is here, just listen! Good. - Your majesty. - The count has arrived? Yes, countess. Darling! Yesterday I locked myself here and I mourned you until you called. It was caused by overzealous journalists. It's not serious. Whose news of his death is spread, he will live long. Completely by accident, this has not even happened. They wanted to pull it out and the car fell on me. Tell me, how does it feel to be resurrected? If for no other reason than that it was worth for this smile. Would you give me an autograph on your news of death? Happily. Really witty, thank you. There are situations that inspires a saying from an old man like myself. - Young man, may I... - Excuse me. I think you shouldn't make more tension with Tisza. The obstruction of parliament has been for a year now. What did we do with it? We prevented the war preparation. But the plebs also got a push as you can see. A hundred thousand people on the street shout about revolution. This is not a joke. You have to try the agreement with Tisza. - You have to go to him! - That's too much. A Károlyi for a Tisza? His grandfather was an ordinary gentry even if he had 20.000 acres to manage. The war is inevitable. We have to prepare for this. The Monarchy would settle with the Russians. Then the Germans could not start a war all alone. We need the Germans. We can't protect ourselves without them from nationalities. The opposition should accept it. When are we going to leave this vicious circle? We have no other choice. I am only willing to negotiate on this basis. You have to understand. Go for war on the side of the Germans would be a fatal mistake. If we win, they will have more control on us. If we lose the country will fall apart. These are just nightmares of Ady, and his hysterical friends. They can write about such things, who cares?! We are politicians so let's talk facts! The opposition will either stop the obstruction in the Parliament, and this makes way to vote for approval of the military budget... We are forced to use these tactics because of your violence. Or I will use all methods which allowed by the law. - There is no such law. - So there will be such a law. I thought you not coming. I promised, so I'm here. Why doesn't he stop? No one understands. Everyone understands. Just listen, all the government people will vote it. What? Do you hear it? This is just formality. Tisza wanted absolute power, so he will get it. I invite the members of parliament to vote! Hereby I note that the Honorable House accepted the proposal. Mom, how is this possible? Well, that's politics. I suspend the meeting. According to the new house rules I order the the removal of the disruptive MP's. Stay, my dear. Come on! - Illegal! - This is unconstitutional! Are you Hungarian? You bring police to the House of the Country? Villains! How dare you?! I will not let an old men to be touched by the police. - Ten people here, arrest him! - Cowards! They don't do this anywhere in the world! Only a Tisza can do that! Let's go. That would be striking. You are ruining the country! Long live Mihály Károlyi! Allow me to say I was very disappointed, Mihály. Hello, how are you? Because that English father... - Hello, how are you? - Hello. Hello, how are you? - Didn't you hear? - I heard. But I'm not willing to accept your greeting after what happened. Please name your assistants! I couldn't see in the dark who greeted me otherwise I will not accept it. Gentlemen! I urge you to make peace. Tisza defends himself. Mihály attacks. - Who scratched whom first? - Shut up, I can't hear Gyuri. Hello, Gyuri! Is there anything wrong? No? That's great! A duel like this can never be deadly. Tisza fights better than Mihály. Mihály is sick, he has a fever. Uncle Duci said Tisza mean, capable of anything. It was about political things and I just said it in anger. An angry cut can be fatal. Hallo? Hallo? Hallo? I do not hear anything. The phone is silent. Why didn't Gyuri give us the phone number? - And what if he doesn't call? - The duel is held in a secret place, but you'll see tomorrow morning all newspaper will have detailed reports. As you know, this is part of the game. Is this a game for Uncle Duci? What can be done at this time? Anyway hang up the phone because he can't call you back. Tisza is so smart that he knows he can't take this insult. but he is also aware that he cannot seriously injure him the more inexperienced Károlyi. Hallo? Gyuri, what happened? Mihály doesn't want to stop? Mihály does not want to accept the judgment of the assistants, that satisfaction has been given. Don't let him fight any longer! Hold that bloodthirsty Tisza! Hang up the phone or give it to me! Oh my God, blood? Blood? Mihály is bleeding. Hallo? Where did he get the cut? Not lethal, just the elbow was cut by Tisza. Didn't Mihály shake hands again? This is very serious he doesn't want to reconcile. I wouldn't make peace either. I recommend Pharaoh. John, come back! It should be the other one. Cézár? All right. Jóska, bring Cézár here! You see how friendly he is. Still, I recommend Pharaoh. In a few days you will become friends with him, and then he can go. I want to try it now. Saddle up! It is dangerous to sit on it. Isn't dueling dangerous? You could have been killed. You worried about me? Anyway... Hungarian against Hungarian is the ancient Hungarian curse. We are surrounded by enemies and we we attack each other. Tisza harms Hungarians more, as the enemy. Tisza is a hundred times more Hungarian than your socialists, with whom you have people councils. I can imagine what Uncle Duci said about me. Being an aristocrat, I speak up with the socialists. The foolish count. Uncle Duci only cares about Hungary. Your friends want to sell it out to the nationalities. Oszkár Jászi, for example, whom you called a comrade. You read newspapers so carefully? You don't make assumptions about me, no? If you have patience, then I will tell you that... why is it a Hungarian interest that the nationalities feel at home. Fine, but then I'll tell you my objections. You see, you are already a democrat secretly. You brought your horses here, I thought you would stay another week. I'm really sorry. It's very urgent. It can't be that important. Say you're sick. I have to be in Pest in the morning. If you absolutely must go, then definitely find me in Pest, to continue the negotiations. My conditions remain the same. I knew he was eccentric. He's done more tricky things than that. Once he jumped off from a fast train, because... he didn't want to miss a date. He didn't even pull the emergency brake. Probably he was ordered by Madeleine. Mihály was always unpredictable. He hadn't wanted electricity in ten years in his palace at Egyetem Square. The evening was lit with candles. I can say it was beautiful. By morning we were all black because of the soot. He must be offended that I foolishly argued with him. Don't be foolish. I found out everything. Wow, how mean! - Who? - Imre Károlyi. They fear that the inheritance will be gone if Mihály has a son. - What boy are you talking about? - About yours. - Don't you understand? - About my son? What will be, or could be. I found out that Imre Károlyi warned Mihály, don't come here again if he has no intent to marry you. because you are too attached to him and gets into an awkward situation. That's mean! Of course he only wanted good, he said. Because, according to him, Mihály has no intention of getting married, and that you don't really need take seriously the feelings of a young girl because they will pass by. Did Mihály say that? No he don't, but that is the rumour. How do you know he didn't say it? He couldn't say. If he doesn't love you, he would not have gone. I have some experience of love. I called her, but she didn't want to come. - It was great, congratulations! - Thank you. One moment. Congratulations, Katus! You rode very well. I especially liked the oxer. Unfortunately I couldn't ride because I hurt my knee. Maybe then I'll say goodbye. Congratulations! Thank you. You were not here at the beginning. I thought again went to a public meeting. With my suspicious socialists. I knew you were offended because I have a different opinion. And if I care about different opinions? Tell me, did you read what Ady wrote in his article, Count Mihály's comrades? Oh, do you also read Ady? You don't assume. Of course. Say, it's true that you travelled on a train with your comrades? - Yes, we traveled on the same train. - To the same meeting? - To the same meeting. - And they didn't go over to each other. And we didn't go over to each other. I confess everything, but now we don't have time for that. Katinka, you were amazing! Like an amazon. Would Mihály travel to Saint Petersburg? You can't be serious. Mihály is so against the German alliance that he can do that. He wants to go to Paris first, leading one hundred representatives of his party. - Then to the Tsar. - Come on! A representative of 1848 independence at the Tsar's? Impossible! I'm not surprised by anything anymore when it comes to Mihály. Isn't that impossible what he says about land reform? He wants to be popular. His popularity comes in handy then for us. We always need political tricks. How could he want land reform who has ten thousand acres? Uncle Duci, I read it in the newspaper. You could also read that he died. And he will be here soon. You have to know the human nature. Mihály knows how far he can go. He is one of us. We will tame his radicalism. It should not be driven wild. What is this telescope for? You can see a Mercedes without it. Last night I dreamed that a green horse galloped along the road, and Mihály sat on its back. It's stupid. Why would he come on horseback? A horse is more beautiful than a Mercedes. Look, it's not Mihály sitting there on that horse? What an imagination you have! This is the rider who takes the afternoon post bring it from the village. This is him! This is him! It's him, Mihály! I'm going down. Don't run in front of him, you spoil everything! What can I spoil more? Hey, just don't have so many of you the age difference between. 18 years! As much as I am. But I'm not getting married anybody else. If your wish comes true, I'll climb up to the tower of the castle, and I descend on the lightning rod. There you are. Well, it's still the safest vehicle The best that you are here! Hello! Gentlemen! - You see, this is the worst. - What? - To write a letter to a man who... - What can I do? Mihaly comes, doesn't ask, where am, not looks for me. He sits down to negotiate immediately. He can leave anytime. It must be the old woman forces him to avoid me. I wrote him a letter every day, I wrote everything about that woman. Finally to realize that she is not good for him. And you are still surprised that Mihály avoids you because of that? I didn't send it. Thanks God. Show me what you wrote. Why is that? Why is that, that only a man can ask marry a woman? Burn those letters. Mihály will finds you childish. And tear that still it cannot be read from the ashes. And I watch helplessly as I lose Mihály. It's crazy, let's not go inside just uninvited. Not uninvited. It's out posted that anyone can enter, and you can see the Károlyi Palace, before being demolished. I will pay for the ticket I have the right to enter. To see how the counts live? Who will believe you how are you wondering about that? I don't care, I don't need to believe. It won't be social here anyway, but Mihály... he can be upstairs. Do you think he is the tour guide? Come with me! It will be much more pleasant on the outskirts of town. You're right. You know, Gizella, there are tenements here we are building. We're going home. László, please turn it on! Shooting! And action! Laci Széchenyi eventually took on the filming. But on the condition that everything role played by a real aristocrat. That's how I became a film actress... For a few days. Countess Gizella, please! - Could you be more passionate? - Of course. Let's try it! Shooting. And action! My princess! Stop it! Sir, you can't make a kissing with these glasses. Take it off! And action! A moment! Great! Sensational! Very good! Excuse me! Don't hate me so much because of Mihály you often see me together. It's not my business who courting you. Luckily, that Mihály did not see how stupid I behaved. I didn't care about other people's opinions. Neither friends nor family. Otherwise, the family knew everything. It wasn't hard to notice on me, that I'm in love They treated me tactfully. They pretended not to see nothing. If something worried them, it was only the question whether this will lead to marriage. Excuse me, are you free for a dance? Yes. - Tell me, Count Károlyi! - Yes. I would be willing to give advice? Of course, provided I can. It's not for me. I have a friend who... she is in love with a man but... but she is not sure that the man reciprocate her feelings. At the same time, another man would take her marry him. What do you think she would be right to marry the man who loves her, but who does she not love? If that girl really likes him the man, then she can't do that. But what if she loves him hopelessly. The man is committed to someone else. A hell of a thing. If a man falls in love with a young girl, who is committed to another. Tell your girlfriend that... marry that to the man who loves her. He will surely make her happy. Thanks for your advice. I think you're right. My girlfriend, I hope she accept it. Then we can go. Don't be angry, now I can not dance. Come dance with me! It's easier for poets, they are ageless. - How old is Ady? - Maybe 35-36. Oh. He is two years younger than me. - And that little girl? Csinszka? - She's not even 20. Bandi worries about his own sickness. - You talk him out of it? - Can Ady be convinced on anything? He has found again the faith of his happiness in this fresh, wild and indomitable child girl as he used to call her. and it doesn't bother him at all what people think about age difference. - You can only be born a poet. - Not bad for a count! It doesn't give you back your youth either. You should meet Ady sometime. According to him, you represent everything which is young in Hungary. In politics, dear Jászi. It's easier there. Our old policy has been the same for 50 years. Democracy, nationality rights. I also switched so late this threshold. The important thing is that you were capable for rejuvenation. Do you think I can do it? Ady describes you as an extraordinary man. Such a person is all young, no matter how old you are. The Tinker Bell Aria was amazing. Jerica's ball in Europe today is the best. By the way, darling. When are you traveling to Paris? Mihály is also going and I would like to go with him for a few weeks to do the Christmas shopping. - You have already received an answer from the French president? - Not yet. But that's understandable. He should gather information on the Hungarian circumstances before he meets me. And his allies also should be considered. - I'm not going before January for sure. - Hmm. Honorable Count, phone call for you. These phone calls! I'll be back. Yes? Thanks. That's great. No no no. The right time. See you then! The car, please! Immediately! Unfortunately, it is an urgent matter. I'm coming late. If we don't meet, goodbye, brother! You can stay here. Then in mid-December. - I don't think it will be good. - How come? Unless it's the French president suggests this date. In the past, you didn't need French president to travel together. I understand. You get bored. Then I wouldn't be here. We give you some crumbs for the bored lover. Madeleine! Follow me to the terrace! I'm so much in love with you. I'll run away with you even if you don't marry me, I don't care about... ...formalities. We're getting married. But we can't make it public for two-three weeks. This would be vitally important for me. For God's sake, Katus! Are you crazy? What are they spying on me for? Get out of here! They are looking for you everywhere. Uncle Duci said he would beat Mihály, if you find yourselves together. Go! - Are you completely out of your
