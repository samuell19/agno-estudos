We had about 170 people in last night. They were queuing up like... ..they were waiting for a bus. Not unusual. Oh, God. They've moved the bed! The bed's moved. Oh, I'm going to have to do it with some gloves. It's not nice picking up other people's used items, but this is all, erm, part of the job. PHONE RINGS Liberty Elite can I help you? 'Hi, there.' It's February at Liberty Elite, one of Britain's most exclusive swinging and fetish clubs. We don't put them out unless we've got somebody there to supervise. Boasting over 12,000 members, it's the 'go to' place, for nonmonogamous couples and randy singles craving no-strings sex with strangers. Located just off the A5 near Rugby, the club attracts up to 200 guests a night. Which means a substantial clean up job for the staff. It's a lot of bedding, 250 towels, 60 sheets, but you just keep it rolling. 40 degrees again. What do you think's on all these towels? Erm... ..body fluid. It's no different to changing your own beds, is it? The only thing is you've got probably an accumulation of different DNA. Oh, dear, missed one. They get caught up in the towels and that. We cater for all age groups. Mature Mischief, which is Wednesday. And then you've got the younger crowd. Hot Wives. But the people are great. Some of them are that nice, they're as nice as the people you meet, going to Asda or Morrisons. Wife swapping became popular in the late '60s, and today there're over one and a half million Brits on the scene, desperate to spice up their sex lives. Come on, let's get this right. Cashing in on our erotic desires, is Liberty's head honcho. 78-year-old, John. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I've been divorced since 1974. The two main hobbies in my life, one is making money and the other one, of course, is young ladies. Or ladies, which I'm very passionate about. I've been on the swingers scene since the late 1960s. 20 years ago this complete building was up for sale. I bought it. I've probably spent one and a half million on it. Liberty is one of over 200 swingers clubs in the UK, all vying to be number one for the discerning swinger. We try and have equipment that people don't have at home. This sort of thing is quite difficult to explain to the family, but the lady would be lying just with her legs, sort of resting gently and just relaxing. It moves with you, nice rocking movement. Have you ever used this? Only a few times. We're going into the main play area. The first time I swung, 50 years ago, we were at a house party. People started pairing off and we thought well, OK, let's... let's pair off, and we did. It works wonders for your sex life. What I designed here is there's two sliders, so that what you can do, you can restrain someone using those. And turn them over without having to release them. OK. How often do you have sex? Oh, gosh! I'm down to perhaps two or three times a week now, but no more. Swinging is a way of life. I'm not sure that anybody was designed to have sex with just one person for the whole of their life. Nice, isn't it? I hate Valentine's Day, I do. One of the worst things in the world. Aw, it's nice. Stop being so soppy. Aw! At least twice a week, the club hosts themed events. Yeah, that looks nice. Does it? Receptionist Sheree and club manager Chanelle are busy preparing for one of their biggest nights of the year, Valentine's. All of our events are a big deal. It's just nice to make an effort. That is vile. What is it? We try and cater for everybody, from all walks of life. Couples... ..your single guys... ..single ladies. Everyone's got needs. When was the last time you had sex? Oh! A good couple of months ago. Cos I know this event is coming up and I know I'm just going to get fucked left, right and centre! People get the wrong perception of the people that attend this club. It's just normal everyday people. It's just that they choose to do something different with their social life. This one has been inside Hannah's vagina. Why are you holding it that way around? Because that's the way it went! HANNAH LAUGHS Engineer Justin and stay-at-home mum Hannah live with their two young children. We met about seven years ago, and when I was actually pregnant with my second child, food cravings didn't happen for me. I got more sexual cravings instead. I just turned around to Justin and was like, "I fancy adding a third person to the bedroom department." After we had kids the frequency that we had sex did go down quite a bit. Like many new onto the scene, the pair joined a partner swapping website to find their first hook up. It started off with a single female. She came over for some pizza and it sort of evolved from then. And we made him sit and watch. I think they were going at it together for... ..a good hour or so. Every time I came near they pushed me away. I did want him to get involved. But I thought I'm having my fun first. I did feel a bit left out, yeah, cos for the majority of the night I wasn't able to do anything. The couples situation is more suitable for us because then we both get something out of it. I've always been self-conscious of my body, felt overweight, unattractive. I'm just not a very confident person. I was never one of the popular kids. I used to get bullied in school. They used to pull my hair, laugh at me. They used to think that I was a bit of a nerd. It wasn't a really, fun time. When Justin tells me that I look beautiful, it just doesn't feel like it's enough. Our relationship wouldn't have survived if he'd have said no, because obviously, you know, you have feelings for that person and you take their feelings into consideration. But I want other people to look at me and think, wow, she looks really sexy, to make me feel that I still got it, even after having children. After two years of swinging from home, the party will be their first visit to a club. So what are we taking then? Well... Mm! Not a great deal to them. They're probably going to come off by the end of the night anyway. if not by me, by someoneelse. This Valentine's Day we're going to go have sex with a load of other people. What could be more romantic? Having sex with other people, it gives me a thrill. The more that I go down the swinging route, the more I can be the woman I want to be. You'll never be fully happy until you've fulfilled needs and stuff. We do provide a good spread. We do a selection of sandwiches, smoked salmon and prawn ring. No expense spared. Yeah, that looks good. Yeah? Yeah. When John first opened this club there weren't a lot of swingers clubs around. Now there's probably one in every town. Some people might not even realise that there's one on the doorstep. Fanny Cradock, eat your heart out! To help stand out in a crowded market, the club boasts 12 four-star hotel rooms, which guests can stay in for 60 quid a night. I didn't think I would be somewhere like here for Valentine's, not that I'm complaining. I've come alone so I can just do what the hell I want, when I want. We're all here to have a bloody good time. And maybe a good fuck, I don't know! That's what I'm here for! Men, don't want one, haven't got time for one. I haven't met a decent one in 33 years. Single mum Malika works as a dancer to support her young daughter. I have trust issues, cos I've been treated so shit by men, do you know what I mean? When damage is done and trust is broken, you lose trust in everyone, really. Since a messy break-up, Malika has turned her back on relationships. Maybe if I'd been treated like a princess all my life, I wouldn't feel like I just want to use and abuse them all the time. I was in a full-on relationship way too young. I was with him for ten years. He was always controlling, possessive. My dream was to be a professional dancer. He was holding me back from my dreams. When I found out he was cheating on me, I packed our stuff and never went back. Now I call the shots. Lap dancing makes you feel strong, sexy. I love the power I have over men. It's quite a turn on. When you're at a swinging party, it's a really free vibe. If it's there on a plate I'm just going to go for it. Why the hell not? I know like to see you enjoying yourself. With guys and girls? Or just girls? Whichever you want. Oh! Whichever takes your fancy. Sounds like an experience is going to happen. Mm! Right. It's the day of the Valentine's Party at Liberty Elite, Britain's premier swinging and fetish club. Happy Valentine's Day. Gone all out, haven't I? I can see what's been done. I'll go and switch everything on. Tonight, eager guests are arriving from across the country in search of some fun between the sheets. Very sexy. The swingers community is quite substantial. On your street, there will be somebody in the swingers scene. For seasoned swingers and husband and wife of 13 years Simon and Carolyn, it's their second visit to Liberty. Swinging cannot save a marriage that is on the downhill path. But it can make a good relationship better. Some people might think this is an odd way to spend Valentine's Day, but we're not ordinary people. This is more of a roll of the dice. We don't have to play if we don't want to and it's nice to kind of be picky, really, a bit. Yeah. I'm sharing my husband with people. It's like lending your car out to someone. You wouldn't just let any old stranger have a, like, drive around the block in it. I told him I was bisexual really early on to make him aware of things that I don't think I'd ever be prepared to let go of. I didn't want to get to, like, my old age and not ever have lived. It was when my mum sadly passed away a few years ago, that really impacted me because my mum loved life and we just really felt that it was important to live life to the most, why not try different things and see how it feels? He wouldn't share a pizza, so nothing took me by surprise more than you agreeing to have a go at that kind of lifestyle. So did you just get into swinging because you were worried about Carolyn running off with a woman? No, no, not at all! I was possibly the most jealous person that I've met before this scene. You never know what's going to make you jealous, though, and sometimes it can just be a kiss, sometimes it could be your wife just wants to fuck someone with a massive cock. But actually, it was really enjoyable. More than having sex, it was about building a connection. Are you sure? Yeah, quite sure! The couple got onto the scene four years ago and they're members of a wife-swapping website boasting over 200,000 users. So we've had a new message. "I'm 38 I love teasing females. I can - but not essential - "tie, restrain and tease their pussy and ass "until they have multiple orgasms. "Even better if they can squirt". Interested? No. We like someone that has read about what we're into, what we're interested in, that can actually use English, full stops, commas. You know, a semi-colon would be orgasmic. Yeah, should be OK, I think. There's an hour to go before the party kicks off. OK, I'm happy enough with that. And the guests are dressing to impress. It's time for Mum to have her playtime. Wow. All right? You look lovely. Ta-da! That looks stupid, right? No, it doesn't, it looks good. For partners of seven years Justin and Hannah, tonight will be their first time inside a swingers' club. Never know, might be a couple that we can join. Yeah. It can be quite daunting for first-timers. It's exactly the same as visiting your local tennis club. When you first go in, you wonder who you're going to have a game of tennis with, who to have a drink with and what to do. You ready? I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Come on, then, let's go. Everything's fine. Good. Come on in, welcome to the club. Please be aware of the step. To ensure the club brings in suitable clientele, guests are vetted before they arrive and couples pay a £20 a year membership, as well as an entry fee. We welcome people from all walks but they have to be quite nice, and I don't mean particularly attractive, I just mean they have to be nice people. Does it help if they're attractive? Well, I think in all walks of life, it helps if you're attractive. Hi, guys. Thank you! People do have a misconception of what a swingers' club is like, dirty old men just perving over women. There she goes. Kerching! They're quite surprised when they walk straight into a posh wine bar. It may look like a swanky wine bar, but for those who play their cards right, a few hours from now they could be having sex with a beautiful stranger. Now, before we go through to the playroom, just so you know, we don't allow you in there fully clothed. You look like you're panicking, don't panic. Underwear is fine. Just not fully clothed. I don't swing. It's just not for me. I couldn't imagine seeing my partner with somebody else. I think I'd be more likely to punch them than anything else! Something strong. Can I get a Jameson's and lemonade, please? Can't beat a good Irish whiskey. I'm not much of a rum fan. It's a good ambition. You'll be fine. I do get nervous meeting new people. I worry about whether they're going to be interested in me. I just want to make a good impression. For some, club nights are an opportunity to satisfy an insatiable appetite for sex. We do have some ladies that go to the extreme. I do know one lady that's had 18, in a night. Don't ask me how, cos I have absolutely no idea. 18's rather a lot, isn't it? Can I come and say hello to you guys? 67-year-old Siobhan has been on the scene for the past 10 years. Are you the owner? I wish, my dear, I wish. LAUGHTER No, I'm just visiting. This is different to the ones I normally go to. Yeah, the Jacuzzi, I'd worry about that, you know what I mean? That's why I'd go in there now, before the cum starts. Just don't swallow anything. Plenty of sucking, but no swallowing. LAUGHTER Valentine's Day is lovely for me, being a florist, because I can make money. But personally, it passes me by, like Christmas. Having never settled down, Siobhan has lived alone for much of her life. Nice and firm. Just as we like it. One reason why I might not have married is that I think I might get bored just with one person. When was the last time someone bought you flowers? Er, a few weeks ago, actually. A friend of mine came around with a nice bunch of lilies... ..er, for an inspection. What's an inspection? Basically, to check out the size of his cock. Right, come on, then. This is my playroom. Bigger, the better. I invite lots of bi boys to come around and play. One there and one here. One in the middle and one there. And then one over there and one there. And then we'd have two at the end... ..watching and wanking, probably, and then we all swap round. I just love watching them suck each other's cocks. Oh! When I first did this, I couldn't believe that a 20-year-old would want to have sex with a 60-something-year-old, erm, but they do, and I'm happy to oblige. Do you think sex would be better if you were in love? Possibly, but then it could also be boring. Would I choose to be swinging or in an unhappy marriage? No question, is it? Swinging. One big bag of toys. This is probably my biggest. That goes up the guy's bum. And that goes inside me. Now, not many guys can take that. The most sessions I've had in a day would be three or four. Breakfast, lunch, tea... ..and possibly even supper. It won't turn off! I'll have to use it then, won't I? I would be disappointed if I didn't play with one person at least, but I'd be very happy if I sucked his cock, he licked my pussy, he shot his load and I had multiple orgasms. Perfect. Siobhan. Are you staying? Yeah. Yeah. On the scene, single ladies like Siobhan are known as "unicorns", considered as rare as the mythical creatures themselves. Hiya. Hi! Welcome to Liberty Elite, there's your locker key. Tonight, two have come at once, as 33-year-old single mum and fellow unicorn Malika arrives. For years, I was the most prudish person you could get in the bedroom. I was a shit fuck. In the last couple of years, I've been scored quite high. I don't have a type, I'm just looking for somebody fun who I can have a laugh with. Are you going in the Jacuzzi? With the party in full swing, a group has caught Justin and Hannah's eye. I love a Jacuzzi, I do. It's my favourite place in the world. In an ideal scenario, we'll both end up playing. I'd like to find a single girl or a nice couple that we can have some fun with. To be able to just go wild is going to be quite an incredible experience. Scrub up, we'll see you in there. Let's go, come on. Oh, my God, I'm so nervous. I did a couple of blow jobs with some guys with some serious truncheons. Oh, my God! Too big to go in there. And definitely too big to go in there. Oh. I'll just plonk myself down here for a second. Husband and wife Carolyn and Simon are on the lookout for a "full swap", sex with another couple. Yes, yes, we've been 20 years together. We are always looking for a girl. OK. That's your dynamic? For her interest, for my interest. I've identified as bisexual, since, oh, my God, yeah, for, like, nearly 22 years now and he's happy for me to do what we do. I like the adrenaline rush, like that thrill of a chase. You get to flirt with somebody, you get to feel that chemistry building that you don't really ever get to replicate in a long-term relationship. What are you guys looking for? What's the deal? Yeah? How's it going, guys? I think we're with that group right now? Yeah, seem to be. You all done? I'm still getting to grips with the whole scene. I feel like if I enjoy it too much, something's going to go wrong. We'd both be open to the idea of an orgy. The more people, the better, because it would make me feel more sexy, just give me more confidence in myself. This programme contains strong language, nudity and sexual content throughout. Have you got the dips? It's halfway through the big Valentine's Day party at Liberty Elite, and the guests are still hungry for action. Ooh! It looks lovely. Olives? Yeah. OK. Our buffet's out, if you're ready. The key ingredient of a pleasant night at a swingers' club is your ability to socially interact with other people. It's a lovely club. Thank you, thank you. If you can't socially interact, you're not going to get a sexual encounter. You're very attractive, which might scare the bloody death out of a lot of chaps, but once you start talking you go, "All, right? I'm from Norfolk." You become much warmer. Ah, thank you. I wish I was 40 years younger, I'd tell you exactly how much of a gem you are. Would you like another roll of meat? I've got two, I'm fine thank you. All right. The buffet isn't the only thing husband and wife Simon and Carolyn have their eye on. What's the best scenario for you? You love playing with the ladies. Yeah. I love playing with the ladies, you love playing with the men, that's our ideal situation. Could have a little poke around soon? SHE LAUGHS It's a common question, "How can you love somebody and yet be on the swingers scene?" Lots of people would never dream of being unfaithful. However, they do quite like the occasional different sexual partner. What does love mean, then? I have no idea. Some nights, the club provides a variety of fetish contraptions for guests on the kinkier side to enjoy. It feels nice. MAN: I'll give anything a go once. Twice, just in case. You never know. Swinging is now a big part of my life and took me in a completely different direction that I never thought I'd go down. Six months ago, my heart was broken. Me and my ex-partner planned this holiday, but the relationship broke up. I decided, "I'm going on my own anyway, I'm going to make the most of it." I'd stumbled across the swinging site while looking through dating apps. There was one section for Gran Canaria. I had the best holiday I've ever had. I had sex around 15 times. Five different women in six days. Nice and fresh. Hello! 34-year-old divorce Martyn has suffered two major break-ups in four years... Hey, up son, you all right? Yeah, you? ..and lives at home with dad Ty, who split with Martyn's mum 12 years ago. When my most recent relationship ended, it did hit me very hard. I was broken for a little bit. It hurt. I am definitely done with love. Right now, I'm about going out, having fun and making the most of it. All right? Yeah, you? Glad to be home. Oh, I bet. Despite only recently finding out about Martyn's new lifestyle, Ty has been fully behind him. I have had my heart broken enough times. And you could see that. You have pretty much jumped from one relationship to another to another, and I don't think you probably ever had that just time with you, and understanding what it is you want from a relationship. You know, I had you very young. And you do look back sometimes and go, "Well when was life ever about me as an individual?" So I think it really is important that you take a direction. And whatever direction that is, all I can say is I'm there to support that. If you'd have asked me six months ago whether I would have preferred someone to love or someone to give me great sex I'd have said somebody to love. Come and join you. Hi! Join our little party. But, currently, good sex. Have you been here before? No, this is the first time I've ever been here. It was not something I kind of thought about, to be fair, until six months ago. My first experience would have been about five, six months ago too, so... So what brought you into it? Well, I'm single and I've got needs. That's got to be by choice surely? That you're single. Yeah. The thing is, it's hard to make friends when you get older unless it's through work. Everything's just bloody dating apps, and I'm quite old-fashioned. I like just going in a room with no distractions, and just talking. I'm going to visit the little boys' room. I was going to say, I need the toilet as well, actually. OK, we'll be back in a sec. He's attractive. He's fuckable. She's beautiful. Once we've sat and had a drink, we're going to go and sit in the hot tub. Single ladies that don't want the commitment, they can get what they need and leave safely. They socialise, they have a drink, they get fed, and then they get pleasure. Malika has been single since a ten year long relationship ended. I was just young and dumb then. It changed me, lowered my confidence. I wouldn't tolerate behaviour like that from a man now. Would you like to be loved? No. I just don't feel like I have to be loved and I need somebody to love me, and I need somebody to want me. I'm not seeking that, I don't need it. Would you like a boyfriend? No. SHE CHUCKLES I don't want a boyfriend, I don't want a husband. What do I want one of those for? Oooh! Two fluffy towels. Oooh! Wow! Look at them, underneath there. My Valentine's outfit. Oh, yeah! Lady in red! 67-year-old Siobhan hasn't got lucky so far, but that doesn't stop her slipping into something a little more comfortable. So you're from Norwich? Norfolk way, yeah. Yes, that's where my sisters live, in Norfolk. Do you go up sometimes or..? No, cos we don't talk. Oh, OK. Fair enough. They don't understand my lifestyle or florist by day, porn star by night. I love that! Sod it, I'll just jump in at the deep end. We've measured it, it's bigger than a wine bottle. We've tried a wine bottle. Yeah, I got the head in. I'm still working on the rest. Here she is! Sorry, I'm Martyn. Hello, Martyn. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. You smell lovely. Thank you very much. Mont Blanc. I shall bear that in mind. Yeah. Jump in the hot tub? Jump in the hot tub, I think. OK, we're going through. Right. These two, they're lovely. Sexy guy. She's gorgeous. Who wouldn't? I thought they'd just go off together, but they want me to join them. That's how it happens, isn't it? Get a bit friendly. All innocent, harmless fun. With a couple of hours to go until closing, time the playroom begins to fill. because nobody wants me I'm being serious, nobody actually wants me When we have a bad experience, it really does lower my self-esteem, it makes you think you're not attractive, or you're not what they're looking for. People shouldn't come here expecting to get action, because then you just get disappointed if it doesn't happen. We can have a little threesome. What happened with you? Because you said, "Oh, my family didn't get me and my life," and then you went from that to... I was brought up a Catholic... Right. ..and then - I was a bit rebellious - and then I met these Christians and got really heavily into it, and you couldn't have sex outside of marriage. So you don't go to church and that any more, then? No. Basically, I had a load of shit in my life, from when I was young. Oh, OK. Yeah. Have you always liked sex? No, basically. I don't think I did like sex until I was 57. Being gang-raped when I was 17 really didn't help. Got in with the wrong crowd. There were seven of them. They would take one of us into the wood and, basically, all rape us, one by one. And then you'd go back, and then they'd take the next girl and do the same with her. Um... And you could fight and scream as much as you want, but you're in a wood, nobody could hear, so there wasn't a lot you could do with it. It just screws you up, really. You learn not to trust men. You have all those feelings that you had when it was happening - anger, fear, pain, all of those - and they stay with you, you know? I became a Christian, I joined a local church, I didn't have sex for 40 years. I prayed, you know? "Please, dear God, help me with this." And there was nothing. And I got to the point when I thought, "I don't even know "if there's a God and, if there is, he don't give a shit about me." Right, just get naked and get in the hot tub. OK. Swinging, I have to say, is very empowering. Now I am in control of my life, and swinging is part of that life. The main thing is being in control of my sex life. I know that I can say no to something, and they accept that. I can I tell them to fuck off, and they'll fuck off. Do you trust men? Yeah, I do now. If you didn't trust men, you wouldn't do it. But it has to be on my terms. I am happier than I have ever been, I'm just slightly disappointed I had to wait so long to find the happiness. This programme contains strong language, nudity and sexual content throughout. Those ladies look nice over there. Yeah. At Liberty Elite, there's just an hour to go before closing time, and the play room is hotting up. When you first go onto the scene, you may decide it isn't for you. But, for a lot of people, it becomes a much bigger way of life than they could imagine. Without a doubt. The thing is, I have to sort of be comfortable that they want me there. We were just hoping that it might have made us a bit more confident. I think I've done well, wearing what I'm wearing now. You have, you have. I don't expect to get any action tonight. Sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn't, you know? You can't force these things. But the important thing is that you just have fun. And if you can connect with people in whatever way, it's good. Haven't even done a blowjob. I'm slipping. SHE MOANS Do you want to put your head in? We'll just have a little wander. Shall we have a look? See what's going on. Having spent all night in the bar, Simon and Carolyn decide to find out what they're missing. Shall we go out again? Yeah. It's too hot already for him. Would you like a nightcap, dear? There's probably only one element of that relationship that would appeal. I think you saw her and was like, "Whoa, I like this." I did. I know, I know. You're right. But... But, then not so much the other side. Yeah. You shouldn't ever settle for something just because you're in an environment which promotes that. Having sex with other people doing the same thing, turned me on. I don't know about you. Yeah. It helps that I've got such an amazingly attractive woman here. If you say so. I do say so. OK. SHE LAUGHS I believe you. The thing I like about swinging as such is, it isn't 100% about sex. It's slightly more than that. It's little relationships all the time. I think it's rather lovely. Our marriage would be amazing, with or without the swinging, but I do feel there's probably lots of benefits. Got your tea? Yeah, I've got my tea. OK, come here. I'm happy. It's kind of like the cherry on top of an already great relationship. It makes me fall in love again. It sounds corny, but it really does. A bit disheartening. Yeah. I don't think it's put us off, though. Oh, no, definitely not. Once we get a chance to come to another one, we're definitely going to go for it. We're not giving up. No, we're not giving up, no. No, we're not giving up. Come here, then. WOMAN LAUGHS Good night? Yeah. Yeah, it was a good night. I definitely want to fuck him again. One night wasn't enough for me. He was awesome. And she was also equally as awesome. He's cute, isn't he? HE LAUGHS Deep down, I would like somebody to come home to. I just can't go through another break-up. It just hurts too much. I like to have my fun when there's no strings, no emotions, all that crap. I catch flights, not feelings. Does an experience like that put you off the world of swinging? No. Sex... Sex is very important. If I had it my way, on my grave stone I would have "She shagged until the very end." Good for her.
