[cheerful music] Hey, hey, hey! Two Son Café. - My man! - Yes, sir. - The usual? - You know it. I saw you down at Independence Bank this morning, man. I was gonna stop and holla at you, but you looked super busy. Yeah, man, Derrick Rose is opening up a restaurant down the street. Yeah? Guess who's doing the construction on it? - Stop playin'. - Yes, sir. Congratulations. It's gonna be a perfect addition to our community, man. Very upscale. I don't expect anything less from you, bro. Mm-hmm. You see what we did with his house? His house? Unh-unh. So you haven't read the Englewood Herald this morning. - Unh-unh? - What about The Chicago Sun-Times? Come on, man, what did Donald Trump do now? No, it's not Trump, bro. The great city of Chicago is demolishing the last of the remaining projects. That's good. I mean, they were only built to keep poor black folks isolated and controlled. El, I'm totally against gentrification because all it does is help pack the prisons, and people are forced out of places they grew up in, man. But I'm not against the tearing down of those project buildings. - Espresso. - Thank you. Mm, brotha, now this is why I come here. Your wife makes a mean espresso. - [in Spanish] Thank you. - [in Spanish] You're welcome. Black folks are the only members of the human race that deliberately walk past a place of business of one of our own - and spend their money somewhere else. - That's true. That's why... [speaking broken Spanish] I love to see a wife helping her husband. [in Spanish] Helping? Honey, this is team work. Just like you and Dawn. Team work, sweetie, team work. Sorry. Please don't get this Dominican blood boiling over here, a'ight? Baby... [in Spanish] What the hell are you trying to say? It means that I love you. - In Swahili. - [laughs] - Oh, man. - Here, read the paper, man. - Just read the paper. - What? Why, man? Just read the paper, Samad, fool! Let me see why you're trying to get me to read this paper so bad. [mumbling] [spits] - Oh! Dude! - [Samad] Wait a minute. - You spit on my shirt, bro. - [Samad] Is this real? That's what I been trying to tell you. Yes, it's real. If they tear down those projects, they gonna relocate all of those people to this community right here, bro. In the hopes that the property value goes down, and the crime rate goes up. Everybody's moving. Man, if our property value go down, we gettin' rid of our alderman. If this happens, like, everybody's gonna leave. The doctors, the lawyers, the entrepreneurs like myself. Your boy, D Rose. Jennifer Hudson had a house around here. The NFL player lives next door to you, what's his name, Khalil? - Khalil. - They all gone, bro. All gone. - No way, man. - You buyin' me a new shirt, man. No way, man. Yes. My wife bought me this. You're buyin' a new shirt. Don't nobody care about your shirt! No way to this. Oh. Man. Probably gonna have to get, like, bars on my doors and my windows now. I don't wanna live like this, man. Hey, ba-- Babe, call and see about those Alaskan pit bulls. - Pit bulls for what? - I think we need some pit bulls. - [Eldon] For what? - Yeah. - Have you read the paper? - No. You need to read the paper. Let my wife read the paper when you're done. No, brother, I'm keepin' this. We gonna see about this. Man, this is like redlining. [Eldon] That's exactly what it's like, redlining. Take this to table seven. - Seven? - Yes. Redlining. Redlining is denying key services like home loans, and insurance. Or increasing the cost of those services to residents in a defined geographical area. Hmm. - Here we go. - Thank you, sir. You're welcome, you're welcome. All right. Now, in theory, this could be used against anyone. In reality, it was almost exclusively a tool used to force blacks and other minorities into particular geographic areas. In 1934, that's when the practice first started with the National Housing Act. Now, today, the Federal Housing Administration was created. And then, after that, we had the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. It was that agency that created "Residential Security" maps for several cities to determine if it was safe enough to invest in the real estate in selected areas. Yeah. I think you kind of see where this is going. Existing black neighborhoods were lined as unsafe, and thus ineligible for financing. [jingling music] [Samad] Did you see this? - How was your day, babe? - I'm sorry. - Mm-hmm. [laughs] - My day was good. Did you see this? What's the issue? I don't see a problem with this. You don't see a problem with this? You're joking, right? No, I'm not joking, right. That's because you didn't read it, you just skimmed over it. - I read it. - Dawn Pool. You're a very smart woman. I know you understood what it said. I understood it. Look, I'm down with it. Sometimes people just need a helping hand, okay? W.E.B. Du Bois says, "To be a poor man is hard, but to be a poor race in a land of dollars is the very bottom of hardships." Thank you, Maya Angelou, for the quote. But you don't think that this is a well thought-out plan by the man to destroy this community? We gonna have this conversation. [sighs] Whatever. And, babe, the only way the man can destroy our community is if we start to fight one another over this silly issue. We are all in this together. Okay, I'm with you. I'm gonna trust your instincts. But, I don't think there's anything wrong with wanting to maintain the fabric of what we rebuilt this community on. Now, I don't want to live around people who hate themselves. No, see, now you're assuming that people from the projects hate themselves. And they could easily assume that we uppity people hate ourselves. You see where this is going? - Nowhere, okay, just forget it. - Baby, I don't know what to do. Look, I'm not gonna let these politicians destroy our community. I'm not against vetting who lives here. - Idea. - What? You got that look in your eyes. Yep. When all else fails, turn to social media. What are you doing? I'm posting this scenario to my Facebook page. You and this Facebook. Do you think we should allow poor blacks from the projects - [scoffs] - to move into our Englewood community? And, post. Now, let's just wait and see what my friends say. Okay. - [cell phone dings] - Oh! - Wow, your friends have no life. - Whatever! Derry Tighten says, "Hell, no! Them n-words are coming to destroy and cause havoc. We the people of Englewood will not tolerate it. Englewood would have to impose a Sharia law because--" Wait. You're talkin' about cuttin' heads off? Now, I'm with that. "Englewood would have to impose a Sharia law because a community that thrives on success, you have to protect it by all costs." Huh, okay. I like Derry. I'm gonna add him as a friend on Facebook. No, you're not gonna add my friends as your friends to your page, no. But, babe, okay, you know what? I guarantee that our community is going to inspire a change in those who are moving here. And I'm sure they're going to inspire something more in us. - Mm-hmm. - You're so hopeful. Hopeful and hungry, and never touch a black woman's phone. I am starving. You're cooking dinner tonight. Oh, Jesus just called me into prayer. [laughs] I'm just playin'. What would you like? Oh, gosh, stuffed peppers, maybe some asparagus. - Okay. - Definitely a salad. Maybe some rice, and, oh, my gosh, probably eat a lot right now, I'm so hungry. Yes, I'd like to place an order for delivery. - Samad! - What? I'm tired. Yeah, some brown rice, stuffed peppers, and, yeah, that steamed asparagus. Yeah. Hey, baby, you want a salad? - Oh, God. - You... Yeah, that'll be all. [sighs] What's up, Khalil? - You see this, man? - Yeah, this some bullshit. My agent gonna have a problem with me, man, if all of this start happenin' around here, man. I can't live around here like that, man. I love the neighborhood. Don't get me wrong. My kids can go where they want to. Neighbors will watch out for 'em. My wife can go where she wanna go without some fool whistling at her, - telling her, "You got a nice ass, baby." - [Samad laughs] But, you know what I'm sayin', I'll lose all my damn endorsements - fuckin' around with this shit. - Hold on. The NFL don't let you live in the hood even if you want to? They let me live, but they don't want me livin' next to nobody, even with double names, She She, Ray Ray, Qui Qui. Fonum. Who the fuck is Fonum? So my wife says that we should give them a chance. [Khalil] Man, fuck, you know what? Listen, man. I'm cool with that, 'cause all my business is in the neighborhood. However the case may be, I can deal with poor people that wanna do better. I just can't deal with no poor-ass mentality, man. Well, they'll support the business. We won't give them any other option, brotha. Yeah, a'ight. [dramatic music] Yep, it's fucked up. I'm gone, man. I'm to the moon. [Samad] Baby, he just threw the watermelon peel on Mr. Towns' lawn like it was garbage. - Did you ask him to pick it up? - No. Well, as a matter of fact, the next time he does it, you pick it up for him to show him that there's a better way. They will see how beautiful Englewood is, and they will fall in love with it just as much as we do. Watch. [gasps] I don't know about you, babe, but I'm excited about our new neighbors. I'm not. I bet they're gonna be some amazing people. Amazing, amazing. [giggles] - You are so happy. - I am. I'm stoked. Wish me luck. - Hey, baby. - Yeah? Um... you wanna... wanna, wanna, wanna? - [snoring] - Really? [laughs] Okay, well, can I at least have a kiss goodnight then? [snoring] [smooches] I still love you. - [snoring] - I see you! Stop! - [snoring] - [laughs] Babe? Babe, hurry up, come look at this. Hurry up, please. Nope, I don't wanna see it, Dawn. I don't wanna see it. I cannot believe-- They are standing in the middle of the street drinking 40 ounces. [laughs and sputters] Really? And one of them is leaning with his foot up against my car. - Now, you gotta go wash my car. - Oh, okay, really? - Mm-hmm. - I cannot... Babe, they are in the middle of the street playing dice and barbecuin'. - [cell phone rings] - What kind of neighbors-- who does this? Hello, Mr. Towns. Yeah. Uh-huh, yeah. Yeah, my wife is watch-- she's looking at them right now. - [Dawn] Don't tell him I'm lookin'. - [Samad] No, no, don't call the police. [Samad] I'll take care of it. - Call the police. - Okay, all right. [Dawn] Wait, wait, wait, babe. - Mm-hmm? - I cannot believe this. What? Babe, there is a little one with a thing wrapped around his head with the flap in the back that you tie. - What is it called? - That would be a doo-rag. - A doo-rag. - Yes, a doo-rag. Wrapped around his waist and shorts looking at Mr. Mathews' car! [cell phone rings] - Get out of there! - Hello? Yeah, a'ight. Miss Harrison? Yes. Hold on a second, hold on. [gasps] They... Yeah, I'm on the other line with Miss Harrison now. Yeah, okay, I'll take care of it. Oh, okay. All right. Okay. All right, Miss Harrison? Don't worry about-- relax. I got it, okay? I will take care of it. All right. Where you goin'? I'm goin' upstairs to change so I can properly introduce myself to our wonderful neighbors. Something we should have done in the first place, baby. Babe, are you sure you don't wanna call the cops? The police? Baby, the men of this community are the police. We take care of our community, not the police. Well, look at this. Officer Bahi just pulled up. - Okay, there you have it, case solved. - Yep. It looks like they're all goin' back inside, so we good. Okay, good. [Dawn] No, babe, I spoke too soon. Come look. Hurry up, hurry up! Babe, they are just standin' right there on the front porch. - Would you come look? - Baby, you can stand on the porch. No, they're not-- you know what? You are no help right now. [gasps] They... There is a girl braiding another little girl's hair right there on the front-- who does this stuff? [laughs] Baby, you know what you should do? You should go out there and get your hair braided. Yeah, you'd look good in some micros. I love it! I love it. Black people are so colorful. Samad, this is not the time for you to be laughin' right now, because I'm so serious. Baby, what did you tell me? Give 'em a chance! [laughs] [quirky music] [scoffs] They are just makin' our neighborhood look so... so... so ghetto! [scoffs] [hip-hop music] [laughs] Hey. Donald Trump just tweeted that if Chicago doesn't fix the horrible carnage goin' on with 228 shootings and 42 murders, up 24% from last year, he says he's gonna send in the Feds. - Have you read this? - Come on, man. You and Omarosa are the only two black people on the planet that read Donald Trump's tweets. Yeah, look, bro. It's gettin' bad, man. I had some nightmares last night. - Really? - Really. The first one, I was caught in a shootout, bro. I almost died in a shootout. The second one, I was standing on the street we live, and guess what? Everybody started callin' it "The Block". Like it didn't have a name. For just some random reason we started calling it "The Block". I didn't own a coffee shop anymore. You know what I owned? A liquor store. Shabib's Liquor Store. Shabib's! I'm not even Muslim, bro. You know what we sold? Potted pork. Cinnamon flavored blunts and crack pipes. I swear to God, I didn't even know people still did crack. Come on, that's a wild dream. That's never gonna happen to you. [Eldon] The two project families that moved on the block, there's one on the right side of me and one on the left side. The one on the right side plays music all day. As the day goes on, it gets louder. All day. The one on the left side, they barbecue. Guess how long they barbecue. All day. That goes on until like the next morning. [Samad] What? I ain't gonna lie, though, man. That barbecue be smellin' good. What? [laughs] No, for real, man. For real. Okay, look, I got a good idea. How 'bout we get all the new residents together and see what they have to offer. I mean, everybody got talented gifts. I like that. That's cool. As long as we do realize that, you know, rollin' blunts is not a gift. Okay, but, if they wanna start up their own business, or go back to school, we pool our resources together, and we pay for the startup, or we pay to send them back to school. How 'bout that? Sound good to me. Probably need to have, like, a community meeting. - We can have it here first. - A'ight, I'm with that. Yeah, yeah. My only concern would be... all these books, man. We gotta move the books around, I don't wanna intimidate the project people. - Books? - [Eldon] Yeah. You don't have any books in here. This is a café. What are you talkin' about? Look over there, she's reading a book. He's reading a book. There's books all over this place, man. Melinda! Melinda, what's wrong with your husband? [in Spanish] He's crazy. Dude, they brought those books in with them. Exactly. [in broken Spanish] He is not crazy. [laughs] - [Samad] We need to get this together. - [Dawn] Right. - [Samad] Involved. - Right. That's the only way we'll get these people to come out. Hi. We're having a community event at Eldon's Café tonight. You should come by. - Hi, little girl, what's your name? - Unh-unh, we don't play that. Did she... [exhales] Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five... I love black people. I love black people. I love black people. Samad, what are you doing? [exhales sharply] Baby, this is just what I need to do in times like this because, whoo, you just don't know. I love black people. I love black people. I love black people. I love black people. I passed out all the flyers and I told everybody on my block. [Eldon] Look at this small crowd. I told you, man, it's the books. Books are like kryptonite to some of our people. Man... [Eldon] Like spraying Raid on roaches. [Samad] We can do good with this. I'm done, I quit. - This is cool. - We can't live like this. Uh, hey, everyone. I'm Tamala. This is my husband. We have a baby girl, but she's sick at home today, so. We moved here a couple weeks ago from the projects. And I love this café. And I've always supported it. It's the only black-owned café that we have in Chicago. I'm hearin' what everyone is sayin', and we're not bad people. Yes, we may act a certain way sometimes because of our circumstances, but that doesn't make us who we are. I mean, your level of success or where you live don't make you any better. Well, actually, it kind of does. What? No, I'm sayin'. I'm not sayin' we're better than anybody here. It's just that... Who wants to argue with the data? I've done the research. My husband and I actually taught many of the families from the projects how to grow our own food. We grow organic food in the vacant lots, and even in our own apartments. We noticed that we didn't see any of that in this community, and we feel that we can bring those skills to the residents and teach them here. I mean, the food that's grown can be sold in your grocery store, Mr. Towns. I like that idea. In fact, young lady, I love that idea. I think it's a fantastic idea. - It's urban farming, right? - Yeah. So would you know how to, say, grow medicinal cannabis, or is it just, like, onions, potatoes, spinach, you know, tomatoes? Spinach, tomatoes, onions, potatoes, squash, strawberries, - whatever you need, we got it. - [Eldon] That's real cool. So you know how to grow cannabis, then. - [Melinda] Babe? - What? No, I'm asking because I have so much joint pain, - and the doctor said-- - You don't have joint pain. - I swear to God, I have-- - El! Okay, look, just give us a chance. Black people had to experience blockbusting once before. We shouldn't have to deal with it from our own people. - She's got a point. - She got a good point, man. I gotta go get those supplies, man. Y'all hold it down. - All right, man. - All right. Blockbusting: a practice where unscrupulous realtors encourage black folks to move into white neighborhoods, or create an appearance of transition, sparking an exodus and driving down prices. [rhythmic music] Once completed, more respectable realtors converted their homes and apartments into multi-family dwellings, cramming large groups of black folks into row houses meant for a handful of people. [rhythmic music] All of these tools and approaches were facilitated by the federal government, and its partners at the state and local levels. This continued until, like, the 1960s, and arguably never stopped. Local housing projects, for instance, were placed in these segregated, depressed neighborhoods. This, in turn, ensured concentrated poverty, and all its intended problems, such as... bad schools, poor public services, poor people. [melancholy trumpet music] [deeper trumpet music] [sighs] [distant trumpet music] Oh. Oh. They played that mambo-rap-trap music all night long. My head is pounding. My ears are killin' me. My brain is now mush. [groans] - [Samad grunts] - [Dawn sighs] How can you sleep through this racket? [Dawn sighs] [Samad] Niggas. [footsteps approaching] Hey, baby. [sighs] Are you okay? Those are three new construction contracts. All right. I'll look over them later tonight. Baby, what's wrong? Baby, what happened? [mysterious music] [door slams] [exhales sharply] They disrespect my wife, they disrespect me. I must have respect. [mysterious music] Dawn wants to talk to you. - Hello? - Hey, Eldon. Okay, okay, I'm on my way. Show forgiveness. Enjoy what's good. And turn away from ignorant. [exhales sharply] [mysterious music] [woman giggling] [mysterious music] Don't disrespect my wife again. This time it's a warning. The next time it won't be. [laughs] Is that a threat, big man? - [Pamela] Jay! - I'm good. I'm good. Now, you, you think you're better than us, man. [Samad] No, man, you think I am. Brother, it's not about who's better than who, man. Look around. Look around. Look at your baby girl. Your woman. Our people suffered long enough, man. It's time for us to be in this together. We need to be in this together. Or is that how you really feel? Man, as soon as I brought my family up in this punk-ass neighborhood, you and your boy pre-judged us. Yeah, and then you gonna bring a million suited Negroes up in here like we wavin' a Confederate flag. Now, get your lame ass off my property. You're right, man, and I'm sorry. We're sorry. We gotta do better as a community. Where he at? Kirk? Hey, come down here, man. Where you was at? Man, they ride deep, man. It's like a wavin' Negro-- Hey, man, apologize. Man, I'm sorry for disrespecting your wife. Don't let it happen again, bro. Mister? - Pleased to make your acquaintance. - You too, little lady. How are you? This little girl. Pamela. [Samad] Nice to meet you. Kirk. So let's try this again. Welcome to the neighborhood. I'm Samad Pool. Jay. So how 'bout we break out the barbecue grills? [Eldon] Oh, hell, yeah. I don't know about you all, but I hung out with my ghetto neighbors till about 4:00 a.m. this morning, man. Eatin' ribs! Hey, I might start by eating pork for real. - [laughs] - Ghetto ribs for everybody. Baby, go get some garbage bags, please. - Yeah! - [Jay] Thanks. A'ight, man. See you in a couple hours? - Yeah. - A'ight. - Here, Daddy. - Hey, baby. Thank you. - Think I'm gonna like it here, baby. - Yeah, it's cool. I'm so proud of you. I'm just tryin' to do me. [Dawn crunching] Mm. Mm, mm. - Babe? - Yeah? I am really proud of how you handled the situation. I think we're gonna be all right. - Yeah, they're some good people. - Yeah. - We're gonna be fine. - They are. Oh! I talked to Pamela today. I made me a hair appointment to get my hair did. - [both laugh] - On our front porch? Unh-unh, in her kitchen. [laughs] Look at my baby turning ghetto on me. My strong, black husband. - I am who I am because of you. - Aww. [laughs] Mm, goodnight. [dramatic music] Here you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. "Black people must be honest enough to admit that our standards do often fall short. One of the true signs of maturity is the ability to rise to the point of self-criticism. Even when that criticism comes from whites, we must pick out elements of truth in it. Our crime rate is far too high. Our level of cleanliness is far too low. Too often we live above our means, and spend money on non-essentials. We fail to give to serious causes and organizations. We're often loud, and boisterous, and spend far too much on drinks. Even the most poverty-stricken among us can purchase a ten-cent bar of soap. And even the most uneducated among us can have high morals." Dr. King, Testament of Hope. Hi. How are you? - I'm good. You? - Good. Could I actually get a café latte? - Café latte? - That'd be great. - Okay, coming right up. - Thank you. A person who was poor with bad spending habits does not save. That's just a fact. But, we knew that there had to be a moral component when building this community. We didn't just seek after black people with loads of money who took this as an opportunity to make more money and completely disregard the building of people. [laughs] Come on, Chuck. Look, we all know that there are some blacks who benefit from the economic ignorance of other blacks. However, however, let me state my point. We searched through the city of Chicago for folks who not only cared about this community, but they cared about the people. And they had to understand the value of money. So yes, we have our own schools. We have our own banks. We hired our own police force. This community, according to FBI stit... - Statistics. - [Samad] Thank you, baby. - According to FBI-- - Statistics. This is the safest community in America. They didn't say the safest black community in America. They said the safest community in America, Chuck. Okay, okay, okay, great, great. That's great, okay? But, come on, guys. You created a community, and I think it's safe to say, it's for, for black people. For blacks only, right? I mean, it's no different than for whites only. So, you know, I mean, come on. Is this a form of reverse racism? Hmm? I mean, come on. I think it's also safe to say you're practicing reverse discrimination. I mean, this is, it's ridiculous. I think Martin Luther King would be rolling over in his grave. Listen to this nigga, man. All right, let's keep it pleasant. [mockingly] Let's keep it pleasant. Funny-talkin'-ass nigga. Man, look, I'm not as refined and diplomatic as these two, so fuck that. I'm not gonna tolerate any hanky-panky, guys. Hanky-panky? Oh, this nigga gets cornier by the second! All right, uh, yeah, we're done. Turn the cameras off. - I'm not gonna tolerate this. - Don't you turn off that damn camera. And you sit yo' ass down. And El, you know I'm not that diplomatic, either. Sit down. We ain't no passive Negroes up in here. - Yeah. - Chuck. Sit your hanky-panky down, man. [sighs] Now. You say it's reverse discrimination and racism. So, essentially, what you're sayin' is, it's quite okay for black people to live in communities with high crime and broken families. Every other street corner's infested with broken black men who ain't on shit. Arab liquor stores everywhere. Churches housing the spiritual dead that's tryin' to buy they way in heaven. But, the pastors are basically fuckin' pimps, man. We had over 600 churches in this community before rebuilding it. - Now, we have one. - What does that have to do with me? But a nigga like you say it's reverse discrimination and racism for black people to live in safe, peaceful, economically strong communities. That's the type of nigga-shit I don't like. And that's exactly why niggas like you... can't live here. Great, 'cause I have no desire to. Good! Because this community is here, and it's not going anywhere. We will kill and die for it. [in Spanish] Do you understand? Exactly my point. Thank you. That's my point. Thank God for martial law. Can we shut it? [Eldon] You say it's reverse discrimination and racism. So, essentially, what you're saying is, it's quite okay for black people to live in communities with high crime and broken families. Every other street corner's infested with broken black men who ain't on shit. Arab liquor stores everywhere. Churches housing the spiritual dead that's tryin' to buy they way into heaven. But, the pastors are basically fuckin' pimps, man. Need you to sign some paperwork for me. It's to free the guys up for the demolition, sir. All right, thanks, Sophia. Appreciate it. Have Rick take this to Alderman Burke. - You got it, Boss. - Thank you. [Eldon] ...shit I don't like. And that's exactly why niggas like you... can't live here. [suspenseful music] [ominous music] - Hey, Mommy. - [Pamela] Hey, baby. - You doing homework? - Yeah. Okay. I'm so sweaty right now. I'm about to take a shower, babe. - We best leave out in a second. - Okay. Hey, baby, go upstairs and get ready for school. Okay. - No kisses, though. - What you mean? I'm all dirty feelin'. - I don't care about that! - Later! [smooches] [groans] All right. Hey, come on, let's go. [horn honks] [ominous music] [Pamela humming] [ominous music] [water running] - [gunfire popping] - [Pamela groans] [groans] [down-tempo music] [water running] [Mr. Towns] I told y'all. I told you we shouldn't have let them move in here. We haven't had a killing in ten years. They been here for two hours and bodies are droppin'? White folks said niggas'll bring your property value down. Now, I love black people. But I hate niggas. So how you think we should handle it? Think we already know the answer to that. A black woman's killed, so for me, it is personal. - We can get Kent Masters on this. - All right. Jay, sorry about your wife, brother. Yeah. Yeah, I need for you guys to look out for her for me. You brought this shit to our community, man. Hey! Someone killed my wife this morning. Them crackers won't even let me see her, so, so fuck you! Look... please... Yeah, of course. No problem. Samira, be good, okay? Okay. - When will you be back? - Soon. Soon, I promise. I love you, Daddy. [crying] I love you, too. Okay, all right, be good. Jay, wait up. Y'all be signing up for that bullshit. [train whistle blaring] Dad. What's up, big bro? Rick. Heard about your girl. I'm sorry about that. She was my wife. Oh, yeah. I remember. We didn't get invited to the wedding. Son, I bought you that new house to keep you out of trouble. Why does trouble keep following you? How's the job, Jay? Job's a job, Rick. Yeah? No write-ups? Warnings? Fired on your days off? Why does trouble keep following you? Sorry to interrupt. I was about to ask the same question. Shut the fuck up. Look, I need your help to find out who did it. Well, in case you forgot, I'm a businessman. I don't get involved in street gang shit. This wasn't no street gang shit. Niggas ain't savvy enough to clean up after themselves. Look, I need you and your wife to use your political connect. They killed my wife. Yeah. Well, I'll ask her. But, until then, stay out of trouble. Stay low. Need money? I never asked you for shit. But I need your help. I'll ask her. How's your daughter handling this? She's good. I really need your help. You got it, son. You think he knows and he's just fuckin' with us? Go find out. Jay! Big bro! Hey. Look, you don't have any idea who did it? 'Cause if you do, I'm with you all the way. If I did, I wouldn't be here, now would I? No, I guess not. Look, Jay, I know I don't always act like it. You're my blood. You're my brother. - I love you. - Yeah, I know. I know. Come on, man, you're not gonna reciprocate? - Reciprocate? - Yeah, reciprocate. I learned a lot of big-ass, fancy words in the joint. Bring it in. Bring it in. You know what else I learned in the joint? - What? - How to make a really good toilet wine. - I know that sounds gross. - Keep that to yourself. Hold on, you don't have to use a toilet. [Jay] Rick. Drive safe. [quirky music] [Samira crying] It's gonna be okay, sweetie. No, it's not. They killed my mom. Why would they do that? [sobbing] I don't know. [sobbing] They should have just killed me too. My mom is dead, and my dad left me! Your dad didn't leave you. I know what I'm about to say is not gonna bring your mother back. But whoever killed her is gonna pay. My dad says people don't go to prison for killing black people. Some do. Some never get caught. And others just die. How do you know the men that killed my mom will get caught? I don't know. I hope the police get to them before my dad does. 'Cause they really pissed him off. And I don't wanna see my dad go to prison. Ms. Pool? Yeah? My dad really loved my mom. He's gonna kill the guys that killed her. [Chuck] I'm sorry to hear about the brother's wife, but let me make a few phone calls and see what I can find out. Now, you guys do know who Jay's daddy is, right? No, who? James "Big Pops" Looney. Irish mobster turned real estate tycoon. And his wife is Angie Looney. Angie Looney. The Cook County assessor? [Chuck] Yep. His mother, obviously, black. Used to sing in a popular singing group back in the day. She was killed in a horrible accident. So's he was raised by his grandmother with a little financial help from his father. Hey, and he also got street cred. - Street cred? - Hmm. And James and Angie Looney have been tryin' to use their political power to purchase the remaining 90 underdeveloped homes here in Englewood. Mm-hmm. Which reminds me, we need to place our bid ASAP. A savvy investor will want to buy those homes. It's like discovering oil. Hey, and you know? I think this is more than just about them buyin' them homes, too. But, hey, what do I know? So, wait, you think he would have his son's wife killed? Absolutely. [pensive music] [mysterious music] Shh. [Big Pops] So how was your day? [Angie] Dreadful. Englewood Investment... made a bid for the 90 remaining homes. Well, that's not good. You realize, they take ownership of those properties, what kind of power they'll be able to wield in Chicago? And this is the third largest city in the country, Angie. We're getting paid a lot of money... to destroy that community to keep that kind of shit from popping up all across America. I know, can't you just call the big dogs and get permission to start a war among the gangs or somethin'? There are no gangs in that community to start a war with. And they're also not killing each other. I gotta hand it to them. They value their lives, and it makes... makes it really hard just to kill 'em. Moving those people in from the projects didn't help any. Gosh. Oh, and before I forget, did you receive a call from the mayor? No, why? What happened? Alderwoman Thompson was on the radio this morning. Again accusing the Chicago Police of being behind some of the drive-bys in the Auburn Gresham area. The witch won't stop. Yeah, well, that's a community infested with gangs, and it makes the job very easy. And Alderwoman Thompson's days are numbered. She's got a very big mouth. No, no, those Englewood residents will never vote her out. She fights for them tooth and nail. She's the only one over in City Hall I see actually fighting for her constituents. The rest of them'll sell out for crumbs. She's interfering with the bid. That bitch is gonna find herself buried next to Jimmy Hoffa. Well, just do me a favor, and please don't make it so obvious. You know, make it look like a heart attack. - Or cancer. - Whatever. We need the rest of those homes. I know. [scoffs] Jay wants us to help him find out who killed his wife. Ha! Good luck with that! Really? God, that boy is so stupid. And where'd you see him, anyway? He came by a day or so ago. Couldn't help him. - You know you're frightening, right? - [laughs] Help the kid find the person who had his wife killed. Help the kid find the... Baby, look, I'm tired. Can we go home? Yeah. [people chatting] [mid-tempo music] - [knocking] - [laughs] [mid-tempo music] Look it here. Look at this nigga, man. "We must realize that our greatest enemies are not those on the outside, but within our midst. When we recognize that those on the outside, and don't allow them to pass, then we have those on the inside working with us. To destroy us." The Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey. Do you know why we're doing this? You men talk too damn much. Hoo-hoo! Ha-ha! Man, your wife is gangsta as hell. Hoo! [mid-tempo music] [upbeat music] One of the men who killed your mother was just found dead. [somber music] Just another dead black man. When will our people ever learn? [somber music] Am I the only one that noticed that all the ex-Bulls play for the Timberwolves? They call them the Minnesota Timberbulls now. For real. The whole team over there. Man. You know, you and Melinda got the best cafés around, right? The things we do to protect it. So how do you feel? I don't know, man. Not good. I guess we do what we have to to protect what we buildin', right? Right. It's just crazy, man. It seem like if we destroy our community, we killin' our own. And if we build our community, we kill our people. It ain't gotta be like this. Well, on January 20th, 1832, with the Virginia House of Delegates, Henry Berry said America has to pass severe laws to keep us in ignorance. He said they have to "close off every avenue, which, by light, might enter our minds, which keeps us at the level of the beasts in the field." If this continues, if this continues, black people will never be able to rise above our condition. We've been beggin' for 400 years, bro. What do you think would happen if people like Russell Simmons, Diddy, Jay-Z, Bob Johnson, Robert Smith the billionaire, Oprah Winfrey... Don't forget Tyler Perry... What would happen if they put their money together? Rebuild one black community at a time and make America great. For once. - For us. - Bingo. That's what I'm talkin' about. Hey, man, I gotta get home to the wife. Thanks for the pizza. Send Melinda my love. - A'ight? - She on her way to pick me up, too. - Brother Malcolm. - Whatever. You missin' the glasses, though. You need some glasses. You missin' this dried up pizza, bro. Come get this. Don't leave it here. [foreboding music] What's up with those lattes, Ma? - Excuse me, sir? - You own the café, right? - Yeah! - What's up with those lattes! [foreboding music] Free lattes. [engine revs] What you watchin', pretty girl? This classic called Black Orpheus. [Dawn] Oh! What do you know about Black Orpheus? It's my mom's favorite movie. Mm. Well, do you mind if I sit and watch it with you? I'd like for you to. Well, then, scooch your butt over. [laughs] And share your popcorn too. Yeah. I think you have the wrong number. [telephone rings] [Melinda's voicemail] Hello. This is Melinda. I can't talk to you right now, so just leave a message. [in Spanish] Thank you! [telephone rings] [Melinda's voicemail] Hello. This is Melinda. I can't talk to you right now, so just leave a message. Fuck, man! [rhythmic music] - [groans] - [thuds] [dramatic music] Justifiable homicide means whatever is justifiable is excusable. It's excusable because it's justified by the principle of justice. The term homicide means the murder of one human being by another. On July 24th, 2018, at 11:59 a.m., my wife was murdered. The man who killed her, hair was like mines. His skin was like mines, and, most of all, his history here in America was like mines. I found and I killed that man. More black men have died in one year than American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan in five years. If you look at the murder rate in the black communities, there's a civil war goin' on. In one year, 20,000 homicides across America. Forty-six percent were us killing us. That means nearly 9,000 young black men were murdered, not by a white police force, but by us. [pensive music] Damn, my brotha. I am sorry. I'm sorry, my brother. But you gave me no other option. [pensive music] [intense music] What, you're gonna go? Can you stop playin' with my food? Okay, you know what? Keep the food, give me my money back. Let me close up shop right quick. I have a nice, comfy bed in the back, and, if you do it right, I'll give you the gyro and fry for free. Nigga, who the fuck you think you talkin' to? I know I'm dressed summertime fine, that don't mean I'm one of these little thots around here that you can talk to any kind of way. And, I promise you, I wouldn't fuck you for all the oil in the Middle East, or whatever raggedy-ass country you from. Here, just take the food and go. I don't want that shit. I don't know why I came up in this nasty-ass place anyway. Baby, don't be like that. "Baby"? [laughs] You see this? 'Cause I'm about two seconds away from calling my husband to burn this whole motherfucker down for disrespectin' me. Yo, don't get that nigga fucked up! Now take this dogshit and get out of my store before I call the police. Y'all just gonna sit there and let him talk to me like that? Those my niggas. Bros before hos, snow bunny. I just came from Jumu'ah, and you comin' up in here, and you're fuckin' up my day! Y'all some fucking cowards. You think he'll let you sit here and talk to his woman like that? Okay, okay. Since there's so much mother fuckin' estrogen up in this bitch today, guess what? Take some tampons, you scary-ass jigaboos. Now, pick it up and go. You fuckin' with the wrong one. Whatever, Maxine Waters. A'ight, keep talkin', bitch. I'm comin' back for that ass, I guarantee you that. Stupid-ass. [water gurgling] - May I sit? - Yes, sir. Your name is Jay, right? Yeah. How you know? It's my job to know every single resident in the community. We had the brothers out looking for you. For what? We know what happened to your wife. I'm sorry. My condolences. If you consider having her funeral here, the community fund will take care of all the arrangements. I'm not here because I'm in any trouble. I found a way to pay for it. Plus, I don't like anyone making me feel like I'm obligated to go to their church. I understand. Jay, if you haven't noticed, our community consists of Christians, Muslims, Hebrews, and people that don't do religion. But when it comes to the betterment of our people in this community, we put religion to the side. I'm sure if you went to the synagogue or the mosque, they would offer to take care of all the arrangements as well. I feel so crazy. They killed my wife. Destroyed the best part of me. This is what we call "The Test". Tests and trials are necessary for purification. Why would God put this on me? You have a purpose. Sir, my baby girl's mother is dead. Maybe you need to realize... I don't know... that God has something else in store for you. Maybe you need to figure out what that is. [scoffs] I don't think He thinks about me like that. He does. I mean, we often wonder why, why? Why would He allow us to feel so much pain? And, later on, we realize that we misunderstood his purpose in that situation. If you see that... then we are blessed. And I'm not gonna pretend. For a lot of people... that's a big if. You know what I respect about this conversation? What's that? You didn't come over here and start spittin' scriptures. That you came over here for real. The way I understand things. The Bible is the word of God. But, the word of God cannot be confined to a book. If so, every tree would be a pen, every ink would be the ocean, and... His word could not be worn out. If you need anything... consider this one of your homes. Rev? What does the Bible say about, um... revenge? Roman 12:19. "Do not take revenge, my friend, but leave room for God's wrath, it is written. 'It is mine to avenge. I will repay it, ' says the Lord." Psalms, Chapter 82, Verse 6. "Ye are Gods. And we are all children of the most High." To me... that means He works in us. [Tamala] Look, if it wasn't for my husband, you know, being overseas on business, I wouldn't have came to you all. But, the fact is, dude was completely disrespectful, and, I guarantee you if he talks that way to me, he talks that way to other women, too. See, that place is on top of our "do not support" list. Just last week there was an incident with a young lady, and we sent out multiple messages: "Do not spend money there." I take it you didn't get the group text. Oh, no, I got the text. I was craving a gyro, y'all, come on. Gyro? It's okay, we're not judging you or anything. We're not gonna fight you or beat you up. But, these are the type of sacrifices that we must make in order to keep our community strong. Because those $3.00 or $4.00 gyros is like-- [scoffs] Girl, that was $6.00, okay? $6.00? Oh, that's even worse. See, those gyros is what's helpin' build his community - and help educate his children. - Yeah. Okay, you know what? Y'all being judgmental right now, so I'ma go, 'cause I just can't take this. - It's too much. - Ain't nobody judging you, calm down. Okay, but y'all are makin' me feel bad. Feel bad? All that urban farming you taught us how to do, and we're being judgmental for a lifestyle that you introduced to us. - Stop it. - [Samad] What? I was havin' a craving. Why is the store still open, anyways? Because it's the west side of Englewood. We're currently trying to get it, but it takes time. So, for now, we don't deal with that part of town. It's still there because we're still craving gyros. [both laugh] Girl, okay, fine, can y'all stop makin' fun of me now, please? Sister, you have to protect us so we can protect you. We can't support businesses that disrespect us. What do you think will happen if we sent some guys over there? I mean, y'all are actin' like I'm tellin' you to go beat the guy up, or kill him, or something. No, seriously, you should hear this. [Samad] Look at it this way: you know when you were trying to teach us about planting strawberries? What if someone is not listening to you? How does that make you feel? Exactly. We need you to listen to what we're sayin', and not take it personal. [laughs] Good luck with that, 'cause I'm a Leo, okay? I know one thing, if you don't hush up, I'ma kick you out of my house. - [everyone laughs] - Okay, okay. I'm listenin'. I swear I'm listenin'. We have to respect, protect, and honor the women of this community at all costs. And any business that doesn't, we're takin' our black dollars somewhere else. That somewhere else is right here. Baby... I know it's not a good time for El, but... I think it's time we pay that store a visit. Oh, y'all gonna beat him up. [gentle music] Listen, Akbar, the next time we come in here, ain't gonna be no conversation. We shuttin' this joint down. Are you guys done? You think this is a game? I'm not afraid of you guys. Don't come in my place of business and start dishing out threats. Go back over to your paradise. Now, get out of my store! I see you guys think I'm some pussy. Now, beat it, like Michael Jackson. I guess that'll make you Janet. Man, give me that... [energetic music] We tried to give you a warning, but you didn't wanna listen. Now, get out of here! We have a duty to protect and respect our women. They should be free to express themselves in environments where they're honored. And not have to worry about harassment or propositions. Our women have given us so much, and it's up to black men to create that world for black women. Our partners. They often fight for us at times when we too afraid to fight for ourself. They've given us life, love. And now, they suffer hardship, rejection, indignity. Just so they can make a way for us as mothers, sisters, and even as wives. We owe them so much more than what we give them. It's time we repay that debt. [energetic music] [guitar music] [sighs] [remote beeping] Angie? Who killed my wife? I'm working on trying to find out who, Jay. You know what? You are the worst stepmother. But you're even a terrible liar. Then do what you need to do, son. May I come in? I had a meeting with the mayor. He applauds us on what we're doing with the community. He also sends his condolences to Eldon and Jay. I went by Eldon's home and I spoke with him. I can't imagine what he's going through right now. But I really don't know anything about this Jay guy. What's the deal with him? He's a good guy. Hmm, I'm sure. Or he would have been out of this community a long time ago. I know you're very protective over who gets in here. And I'm here to protect... or... support you guys. But, you already know. Tyrina, you and I go back since the fourth grade. So keep it 100. The third grade. You were in that class for two to three days before they removed you and placed you in advanced, so, technically, the fourth. - Third. - [both laugh] It's water under the bridge. You sure about that? Thank you. That's my girl. You're my alderman, and I need you to do something about those guys. They're above the law. Hey, trust me, I'm working day and night to find a way to eradicate their entire community. Hey, what's the deal with Alderman Tyrina? [sighs] That woman has the backbone of Genghis Khan. I went to her, and showed her the amount of money we can make working together. She spat it back in my face. She is fiercely loyal to the Englewood community, and that is an understatement. - I mean, I offered her everything. - Did you offer some dick? [laughs] I thought about it. I'm sittin' here with a fucked-up face, so I hope you guys are enjoying your laughs. - What do you want us to do? - Kill those fuckers. - Hey, where are you from? - I'm American, shithead. - Where are your parents from? - Iraq. All right, keep up, Hajji. With that berry on your face, we try to sneak in and kill one of theirs, they're gonna figure it was you. Your dumbass will be back in Iraq eatin' fuckin' pita bread, dodgin' American drones the rest of your life, so slow the fuck down. Yeah, just stop being a big baby and take the L. [Burke] Listen, I met with the mayor this morning, and Alderman Tyrina was there. He personally told her what an amazing job she's doing with her city. - [Big Pops] Did she buy that? - [Burke] I don't know. [Burke] But, I met with him afterwards, and he assured me he's 100% with our plan. - [Big Pops] What's going on, son? - [Jay] You, Pop. What's with the gun? I don't know, it makes me feel a little more, uh... - [gun cocks] - comfortable. You know, I spoke to Angie. - Did you? - [Jay] Mm. I'm gonna catch up with you later. Da, da, da, da, da, da. Sit yo' ass down. A'ight. - [Jay] Unless you want bullets following. - That's cool. Where is Angie, Jay? Did you do anything to her? Well, I asked her if she knew who killed my wife. Mm-hmm. And what did she say? This is the first time I ever had a cigar... from my old man. How cool is that? You got a light or somethin'? - There you go. - [Jay] Thank you. Have a cigar with your son. Have a fuckin' cigar with your son! You got my last one. Damn. [laughs] I don't even know if this shit is, uh, cheap or expensive. Knowing you... it's probably cheap. - You're a disgrace. - That gun don't scare me. I bet the bullets in this bitch will. What, you wanna find out? Someone put the order out to kill me and my wife. What do you mean, "put the order out"? I'ma find out who put the order out. And when I have concrete answers, I'm gonna find that person. Then I'm gonna kill 'em. If anyone threatens me or my daughter, phew. I already recorded all y'all conversations. And I passed it on to a couple of my friends to hand over to the FBI. Don't ever forget, I know where all the bodies are buried in this bitch. And remember this. The only reason you're still alive... is because I'm not gonna kill yo' ass on suspicion. But, from now on, I don't have a fuckin' father. My heart is beating so fast right now. I'm stayin' away from you guys. I'm about to go to the mosque and do 1,000 rak'ats. [plaintive music] [cheerful music] Yo, El? [crying] Oh, man. What's up, El? I miss her, man. - I miss her a whole lot. - We all miss her, brother. But, you already know that me and Dawn are here for you, right? Thanks, bro. I'm thinkin' about selling the cafés. You jokin', right? You can't be serious, man. This is her vision, man, I can't do it without her. That's exactly why you gotta stay open, El. Look, Melinda was about serving the community. This is how her vision lives on through this café, man. Too many memories for me, man. Then think about the good ones. I just can't stop the tears from coming down, man. [Samad] Then let them come, El. Let 'em come down. Don't you ever apologize about cryin' for your wife, man. Let 'em come. Oh, baby, I'm sorry I couldn't protect you. I'm so sorry I failed at everything. [sobbing] Man, I got you, bro. Come on, we gonna get through this. Come on, man. I got you, man. I got you. I got you, brother. [lively music] [kids singing] I love this place. What? What? I can't take a moment to stare at my beautiful wife? [laughs] Of course. I love you. I love you too, baby. How's Eldon? Baby, he's not doing too good. I miss Melinda, Samad. I know you do, baby. And El is talking about closing the cafés. What? No, he can't. He can't do that. Baby, it's too much for him right now. He don't-- Melinda and Eldon have created something special with those cafés. So we're not just gonna sit back and let her legacy die. And we can't let him give up. Dawn Pool, that's what I love about you. [laughs] [kids chanting] Ice cream, ice cream! Cherry on top! [Jay] Umbrella? No, I'm good. What you doin' out here? Gardening. What, you tryin' to garden? Yeah, I am. [Tamala] Okay. These are tomatoes, and these are the carrots. Everything that we plant is 100% organic. What's the big deal? Food is food. Food is not food. All those vegetables that they have at the grocery store, and the fruits, they're sprayed with chemicals, they're genetically modified, which means, guess what? - They ain't real food. - Wash 'em off. Wash them... [scoffs] Okay, I'm gonna need you to listen. - I am listening. - No, you ain't. Yes, I am. - But I hear what you sayin'. - Don't be stupid. Who you calling stupid? Who I'm callin' stu-- I'm... Jesus, okay, you know what? I love black people. I love black people. - I love me some black people. - [Jay] Whatever. [Tamala] Plant. - What type of seeds are these? - Watermelon. How black is that? Watermelon seeds? Just plant. I'm sorry to hear about your wife. Thanks. - How deep you gotta go? - Just enough to get under the surface. So how you doin', man? - [Eldon] I can't complain, bro. - You know I got you-- - Hi, Eldon. - Hey, how you doing? Good. I want what everyone's having. - The Melinda. - Mm, sure thing. One Melinda coming up. - That's $4.25. - [woman] Thank you. Hey, what up, my dudes?
