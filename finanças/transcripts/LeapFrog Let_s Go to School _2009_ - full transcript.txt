Oh, Tad, I'm so excited! Not as excited as I am, Lily. The big day has finally arrived, little sibs. Tomorrow is your first day of school. I bet you can hardly wait. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Let's double check your school supplies. For math, you'll need this and these. For reading, you'll need-- oh, these. For practicing your letters, you'll need this and these-- Oops. Sorry. And we can't forget your snacks. Um, what are we supposed to do with all this stuff? I don't know. Now you're all set. And don't worry. I'll wake you up bright and early tomorrow morning so you won't be late. Thanks, Leap. Thanks, Leap. Ohh. Ohh. Taddie, I think I'm a little nervous. I'm getting a tummy-ache. I don't know my letters yet. I know. I would rather spend our days just playing around. I mean, I don't know my counting and numbers and stuff. Yeah. What if school's not any fun? What if-- What if I have to go to the bathroom? [together] I don't think I'm ready for school. Me, either. Me, either. [grunting] [Tad] Oh, I'm nervous that I won't know what to do. [grunting] Uhh! Whew, Tad! You've got some pretty old socks in your backpack. Surprise! [together] Hi, Edison. I couldn't help but overhear you talking. And it's okay to be excited and even a little nervous about tomorrow. It's normal when you're starting something new. Here's a little secret. Everyone gets nervous sometimes. And if you think you're nervous, just wait until you see how nervous your classroom is. Come on. I'll show you. Uh-oh. Where is it? Where did I put the-- Oh, wait. Ah. Here it is. Whew! Go ahead, Tad. You know what to do. Uh-oh. Did he break it, Edison? Break it? Of course it isn't broken. Heh heh. At least I hope not. It can't break. It's indestructible. Heh heh. I-- I don't think it can break. Whoa! See? Works every time. Step on it, you two. [Lily] I love this part!

Uh-- Uh-- Whoa! Whoa! Uhh! Uhh! Take a look, my frazzled friends. You aren't the only ones excited or nervous about the first day of school. [chattering] The R points this way. I'm sure of it. No, no. I think R points that way. I'll never be ready for tomorrow if we can't even get the letters pointed the right way! Hey! We're not finished here. You're just making a big mess. Excuse me. Chalk, erasers, listen up. Arguing isn't going to help. You need to work together. How do I know which is the right way to make an R? May I direct your attention to the fabulous letter line along the wall? A, B, C, D. It's got them all. If you don't know which way to make a letter, Just check the ABC line. Oh, okay! Thanks, Edison. Thanks, Edison. Let me clean this up for you. I thank you. Now, that is a great R. [screaming, laughing] Coming through! Excuse me! Sorry! Ha ha! My fault! Ha ha ha! Wait, Tad. Don't! Ha ha ha ha! Hello! I'm your friendly classroom globe. Globe? Yeah. I'm an exact copy of Earth, only smaller. I need to practice spinning around just like Earth, so I'll be in top form for tomorrow. Excuse me. [screaming, laughing] A-woo! Ha ha! Tomorrow, calendar, tomorrow! Tomorrow? Oh, dear. Why, that's right after today! Ha ha ha ha! Ohh! I only hope I'll be ready. You see, my friends? Wow! Look at all the books. Everyone's nervous about their first day at school. Hey, what's that? So you two shouldn't feel so-- Huh? Hey, wait for me. [chattering] I'm so nervous, my pages are coming loose. What if none of the children want to read us? What if they don't even know who we are? Don't be silly. I know all you books. You're The Frog Princess. [Frog Princess] Oh! You're Mr. Sleepy Moon, and you're La La Lagoon. Ohh! I love stories. My big brother Leap reads to us every day before naptime. [gasp] Read me first! No. Me first. Me first. Me, me, me! I'd love to read all of you if it wasn't for one itty-bitty problem. I don't know how to read yet. No problem! That's something you are gonna learn about at school. Excuse me. Ha. Ha ha ha. Pardon me. Hey. You stepped on my footnote. Sorry. [chuckling] To read, you just need to know about the letters and the sounds they make. Really? But I don't know too much about letters.

And I can't wait to help all the new students learn to read all by themselves. Thanks, Lily. See you tomorrow. We'll be waiting. Bye-bye! Bye-bye! Bye-bye! [laughing] Oh, sorry. Pardon me. Hoo hoo hoo! Ha ha ha! Looks like there's still some unpacking to do for school tomorrow. Oh, boy! Whoa! Blocks! Hey! Lily! Check it out! Brand-new building blocks. Huh? Hold your horses, Taddie! I found a bunch of toy animals over here. Toy animals? I love toy animals. Are there any little pink hippos, Lily? Hey. What's going on here? Aah! What's the matter with you guys? I'm just trying to play with you. [together] That's the problem! We've never been played with before, and we're very, very nervous about tomorrow. What if we don't stack up? But playing with blocks is easy. You can juggle blocks. Whee! That looks like fun! Me next! Oh, boy! You can balance blocks. [chattering] I'm a big-time block builder. And I know that you guys can build anything, like a block wall or a block tower. Even a block stairway. [chattering] Let's do that first. Yeah! [chattering] [together] Whoa!

Once classes start, we get all mixed up and separated from each other. [Tad] Incoming! Careful, Tad! Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! Oopsie. Sorry, Lily. Sorry, little critters. Let me help. [animals chattering] Oh, this is terrible. If we're not in our proper groups for the first day of school, how will the new children ever learn about animal families? There. Good as new. Taddie, slow down. The animals belong with their families. Too true, Lily. Did you know that every baby animal has its own name, and so does each animal family? What do you mean? What do you mean? See, when you two were born, you were called babies, and you lived with your family. In the same way, when a dog is young, it's called a puppy, and their family is called a pack. Ohh! Ohh! Huh. Whoa! Whoa!

Now we're all ready for the first day of school. [whooping, laughing] Recess. Oh, yeah. Recess? Recess. [clears throat] Recess! Excuse me. What's wrong? What's the matter? What's that you're yelling? Oh, I can't understand a word either of you is saying because you're both speaking at the same time. Sorry. Sorry. Stop that! Stop that! In school we all take turns speaking, so if you want to share your thoughts and ideas, raising your hand will tell the teacher that you have something to say. Ah, much better. Now we'll have no trouble hearing one another. Ooh! Ooh! Can I go first? Me! Me! Me! Pretty please? Quiet little girl, your question. What are you yelling about? Ah. I'm glad you asked. I'm practicing recess time. You see, as the classroom clock, my job is to keep track of the time. We know about time. There are seconds-- And minutes and-- and hours. Yes, and that's a lot to keep track of. I'm nervous because I want to be ready for tomorrow. [clears throat] Recess. Recess. Recess! Rec-- Uh, yes, little boy? Excuse me, but what is recess? Oh, you're going to love recess. It's a special break when all the children go to the bathroom, then go outside to run and play! Run and play? I'm really good at that. Me, too. What are we waiting for? [laughing] Yeah, that sounds like a great i-- Whoa! Oh! Oh! It's a little tight in here. [groaning] Tad, Lily, spread out! Well, we seem to have a problem here. If everyone tries getting out of the door at the same time, no one will be going anywhere. Uhh...uh! Mm, whatever will you do? [gasp] We could take turns. Sure. Like raising our hands to take turns speaking. I think that is an excellent idea. Okay. Everybody line up. Edison first, then Tad, then me. Excellent! You two really are ready for school. [clears throat] [inhales] Recess! [whistle blows] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [laughing] Uhh... [Edison] Whoa! [calendar] Oh! For goodness' sake! I'm so sorry. I just can't seem to pull myself together. Tomorrow is the first day of school, you know. Yes. We know. There are so many things to keep track of. The cards for all the special days-- birthdays, holidays-- and all the weather notes! Here. Let us help you. Oh, you're so very kind. I won't be half as nervous if you two are in the class tomorrow. Oh, we'll be here. We can't wait. You're a calendar, just like Mom has in the kitchen. But what exactly does a calendar do? Oh! Well, as a calendar, I deal with time. Just like the clock. That's right. But while a clock helps you keep track of the seconds-- [Tad] And minutes. [Lily] And hours. Yes. I keep track of the longer periods of time, such as days and months of the year.

I don't know why we were so worried. We are totally ready for school. [bell rings] Ha ha! Before you can think about tomorrow, let's finish up today. Time to go home. [Tad, Lily] Bye-bye! We're going to have a great time together. Bye-bye! Bye, now! Bye! [together] Can't wait to read together. [together] You can count on us! [laughing, whooping] Ohh! Okay, world, I'm ready! [no audible dialogue] Well, well, looks like my job here is done. Mom and Dad are going to be so proud of us. [Leap] Tad? Lily? [yawn] Why are you up so early? School doesn't start for another two hours. Oh, we know. We just don't want to be late for our first day of school. [together] It's going to be awesome! Closed-Captioned By J.R. Media Services, Inc.
