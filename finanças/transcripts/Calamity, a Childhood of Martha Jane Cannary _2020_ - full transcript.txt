'Get a move on ! Martha Jane! Martha Jane! My feet hurt. Will you carry me? It's morning, Elijah. Be brave. Martha Jane! - When do we get there? - Soon. Soon when? In a few months. Tell me again how it will be. When we get to Oregon, the wagons will stop. And everyone will build a real house for themselves. They'll be all colours... blue, white, green, with pretty windows and flowers. There will be plenty of rooms. A room to sleep in, a bathroom. What is that? It's a room just for washing yourself. With stone basins where the water comes in by itself, without having to go to the river. And daddy will have a smile... like when Mummy was there. When is Mummy coming back? Your mother is dead. You'll never see her again. You Poo-brain! Shut up! Take your horse and scram! And YOU are a... - Ethan ! We're going to cross... round up the animals! Yes Dad... Giddy-up! Martha Jane said Ethan was a poo-brain! Are you fighting with him again? He's the wagon-master's son! - He said... - I don't want to hear stories! We're lucky we could join them. They don't have the right to insult us. That's enough! I swore to your mother I'd take you to Oregon. Promise me you'll behave. Martha Jane! Promise? Yes. Alright then. You're next, Cannary family! Hang on tight, children! Hurry up! We don't have time! Giddy-up, Hambone. Modestine, giddy-up! What are you doing, Robert? Straighten up! Ethan! Over there, the calf! The axle is split, we need to fix it. What a mess...! We shouldn't have left them. My friends... We all promised Mrs Cannary on her death bed... to get her family to Oregon. We'll stop, and set up camp. That's it, we lose three more hours! You need to pull yourself together. I won't always be able to help you. Sorry... Martha! You OK? Yes, fine. Eve! Make yourself useful! - Go find some firewood. - Yes, Daddy. Coming? Once we're there, it will work out. If we ever get there! Don't say that! You'll put a curse on us. You lost the calf? You're hopeless! You're supposed to mind the stock, and all you do is show off! You're just a clown! You can't catch me, I'm the calf! Where did the calf get to? That's me! The little calf! Stop ! Stop!! - What are you doing? - That won't be enough to heat us up. Don't go, it's too dangerous. The calf got lost. It may be full of wild animals. They're going to eat us. And they'll tear your guts out! Stop that ! You wouldn't even be able to go there. Don't be afraid. Look at this stone. I found it near a tree on the prairie. I saw it because it was glowing like a fire. And when I picked it up... I heard a woman's voice in my head that said... than this stone repelled wild animals. With it, bears and wolves will disappear. We'll have nothing to fear. Martha! Esther, hurry up. Dad doesn't like waiting. Hey, by the way... I found your calf. It's not ours. So much the better... It got eaten by a cougar. - You're lying! - Go and see. - When I have time. - You're just afraid. Listen to who's talking, with a father like yours! He made us laugh. My father wouldn't have lost a calf! Well,my father is very good at lassoing. One day, some bison barred our way... my father came... And splash, he falls into a puddle! Will you tell me again how will it be? Oh no, Lena, not every night. Please, just a little bit! - Soon... - How soon? Don't interrupt, or I'll stop.. When we're in Oregon... we'll have a field which goes down to a river. Out there, the soil is so good... When you throw the seeds in, it grows on its own. There is so much game there... that when dad goes hunting, we'll hardly have time... to bake a pie. Easy...! Hambone ! What's going on? He's impossible, Robert! Go on, Daddy! Daddy! Damnation, Cannary! Daddy! Your leg and two ribs are broken. We'll lay you down in your wagon. You'll have to remain still. That's impossible. Who'll drive the wagon? I'd help if I could... Come on, let's go! We'll find a way. I'd like to drive the wagon. Don't talk nonsense. Ethan! Come here! Howdy, lovebirds! How's it going? Lost your horse, Ethan? We brought all the calves back. It's better when it's not you who's holding the lasso. Halt! Keep moving! Up to here! Keep moving! That' it... in you go! It's okay, you can go. I know how to unhitch. - You've done it before? - It's not complicated. If you say so. Come on, Hambone, help me! As soon as it boils, you put it in. Watch out for the fire. And don't let Elijah get away. I'll be back... Hambone is thirsty. It's not funny. I'm lumbered with it all day long. Stop it, Hambone! Stop doing that! Stop that! Halt! Vera! Thank you, Martha. But... what are you wearing?! You can't wear trousers! - It's just not done! - What's the problem ? You're a girl. Girls wear skirts. - They're not practical. - Is your father okay with it? You want to try? No, if my mother saw me with you dressed like that... she'd kill me! She's right, you're crazy. May I try? You'd never be able to do it. It's all in the wrist-action. To turn right, you pull on the right. To turn left, you pull... To the right? No, on the left. You let a girl drive for you?! Look out! Hey, boys...! Watch where you're going! Sorry, she doesn't know what she's doing! You've got a cheek, you dirty liar! Do you know what to do, going downhill? Like this! Thank you, Sir. What are you doing here, all alone? I'm with the wagon-train down there. A wagon train? - We're going to Oregon. - You're too far south. - You know the area? - Like the back of my hand. Pik! Come here! I'm a scout for the 3rd Cavalry. Name's Samson. Mr Abraham...! This officer saved my life. 2nd Lieutenant Samson, scout for the 3rd Cavalry. Your daughter was in serious trouble. She's not my daughter. You're alone? I'm rejoining my regiment at Hot Springs. She said that you needed help. No, we're on our way to take the South Pass. The South Pass?! But you're nowhere near it. Wait, I'll show you. See, you're here. - You should be here. - So far ? Believe me, I've patrolled the whole area. We're here? That's disastrous! We'll never get there on time! - How come we're so far off course? - Gentlemen! Let's be calm about it. What's the matter? Your father has guided us the wrong way. Nonsense. Abraham, this officer knows the region better. - We can make up time. - That's not the point. We are not going to trust the word of a stranger. Have you already made the journey, Sir? - No, but I have my guide. - A guide ? Ah, a book. Yes, it's... Let's stop talking about it. - I'm due in Hot Springs. - Wait. Abraham, listen to us. Be reasonable. He knows the area. We can fend for ourselves. We'd be honoured to have you with us. No, like I said, I must be in Hot Springs. What if we compensated you? We are not very rich, but... Okay, for a few days. Thank you Lieutenant. We blindfolded the horses. We descended, holding them by the bridle. And that's how we got down this steep pass. There were rocks that fell around us. It was terrifying. If I hadn't found this passage, we would have been stuck there. In position! Get in line! Forward! Remember, we're swinging west after the rise. Come on, boys, let's go! Go on! Lets' go. What are you doing on this wagon? I'm driving it. You'd be more useful with the cattle. I asked him to do it. The father is bedridden. That girl could manage it couldn't she? Yeah, it's not complicated. So it's settled. You stand firm, you decide. Hold on, but don't pull. You are the one driving. Relax your shoulders. Don't be heavy-handed. You catch on fast! Thanks. I have something for you. What is it? My lucky stone. It's for saving my life. It's very nice thank you. But I was just doing my duty as a soldier. I'd like to join the army. You're not afraid of anything! Here, in exchange, I'll give you my map. Thank you, Sir! I know this region by heart. Where are we on the map? We're there. Right there. I'll go as far as there with you. And see that line? That's the way to Hot Springs. Thank you, that's great! His uniform is so smart! I just love his smile! You can't take your eyes off him! That's not true! - He's so handsome. - So marry him! I like his mustache best! Thinking of getting married? What a crazy life he leads! Imagine if we were able to do all those things! Here, Elijah, eat it all up! No, I don't want it! It's yucky! Yuck! My skirt, Elijah! You spilled it on my skirt! It's alright, Lena... It's just beans! You needn't howl like a coyote! Shut up! You're horrid! Children...! Daddy! - Not sleeping? - I feel better, I'll get up. What are those pants?! It's for horses. Anyone help you? I managed. I get on the horse, I'm lassoing... What's the matter with you?. Do you have to make an exhibition of yourself?! You put me to shame. Go get me some water. Samson doesn't care about you. Leave me alone, will you? He even threw your stone away. Dirty rotten coyote! What do you think you are? Think you can fight, too? I grabbed her by the hair! Who does she think....? Defend yourself! Go on, defend yourself! What are you doing? Go on! Grab her! Let go of me! Let go of me, I said!! Let go of me! You coward! Go away! It's none of your business! What's going on here? You again, you grubby girl!? What's with that hair? And the trousers?! This is outrageous! - Three boys attacked her. - That's enough from you! She started it! "She started it!" Take that! You don't laugh when I speak! Hurry up! Cannary! Straighten out your daughter! I will not tolerate such an outfit in our community. What ? What did you see? Where are you going, Martha Jane? I'll be right back... You go back to sleep! Samson? No... He's left. My candlestick's been stolen! - And grandma's clock. - A necklace is missing. Let's calm down. We will find the culprit. Let's tell Samson. He'll know what to do. Why are you here? - Where's Samson? - I don't know. - He left. - What?! Did he steal from us? Why didn't you say anything? How long have you been here? - I don't feel well. - Speak, you little vixen! Where's Samson? Tell us! I've no idea! It's obvious she's hiding something! - You helped him! - Confess, damn it! - I didn't do anything! - Martha? - What's the matter? - It's your daughter, Robert! - She's a dirty thief! - It's not true, I did nothing! Martha sleeps with Lena who's afraid of the dark. She never leaves her. Lena, what's the matter? Lena... If you saw something, you have to tell us. Martha... She didn't stay with me tonight. I've been very scared. She told me she'd come back, but she never came back. But that's... - Did you leave your sister? - I knew it ! We must find him... he can't have got far! Let's just calm down! It's too dark now... we'd get lost. We don't know in which direction he went. My friends, listen to me! Winter's coming and the mountains await us. - But grandma's clock?! - Let's be reasonable, As precious as it may be, it's only an object. We'll lock her up, and hold a council meeting. Come on, my friends! - Into the wagon! - I didn't do anything, let me go! Abraham, please! Paterson... Let go of me! I've done nothing! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! What did you decide? The Cannarys will be left behind at the next trading post. No, we should strip their wagon and leave them here. It's the only way to repay us. Pik! Help me. I must find Samson... Chew the rope! Chew the rope! I trust you more, Martha, you've changed a lot. Mum was so anxious about her candlestick. It wasn't me, I tell you! I'm going to find all your stuff. I have his map... I know where he's going. You'll never make it! I've got no choice... They're going to dump us. If I don't go, we'll lose everything. His mule must be loaded, I'll catch up to him in no time at all. Would you please mind Lena and Elijah, until I get back? Alright? Eve? I'll catch you, Samson! Giddy-up! So, we're here... And Samson's going to Hot Springs here. We have to go to that rock. That must be it... we're nearly there. Giddy-up! We're supposed to be there... or there... Or maybe... I don't understand at all! Pik, help me. You should know where Samson has gone. But of course...! Here's Samson's map.... Sniff it! Seek! No, Pik! Come back! Drop it! Abraham said two days, no more. She's a kid! We're still going to search. They won't decamp without us. You alright? No, I'm not alright! - Why? - That was a tame bear. - I was training him. - Oh, great. Sorry, I didn't know. Listen boy, I just lost my livelihood. I'm not a boy! What are you? You're sorry?! My boy, there's a problem. Out of there, you filthy mutt! Don't touch my stuff! Won't the bear come back if it's tame? I only caught it yesterday. But it was gonna earn me big dough. You'll have to recompense me! I don't have any money. - You have your horse. - Don't touch Hambone! - You're gonna give it to me! - No. There she is! Martha Jane! Martha Jane! Scram, kid! Giddy-up! What are you doing? Stop! Stop! Stop! Let go, you thief! What have you done?! - I'm really sorry. - Really? Boy, you're a calamity! You make my bear run away, you steal my wagon... You throw everything into the river. And you say "sorry"! Don't touch my horse! He's mine now. He will replace the mule that you threw into the river. I'll take the dog, too. What?? Pik? No way! That's for the bear. Now scram! I don't want to see you anymore. Are you going to Hot Springs? Can you tell my folks? Scram, I said! - OK, too bad for the reward. - Yeah... - A reward? - No, nothing. - I annoy you. - What did those two people want? To exchange me for a reward. My father is rich. Rich? The biggest farm in the region. And I'm his sole heir. So, cheerio! OK, I'll take you home. What's your name? My name is... Marcus. My name's Marcus. Marcus ? Me, I'm Jonas. I'll take you back to your father... but he'd better be generous. Go on... pick up all my stuff. Those there, too. Hurry up! Is Hot Springs far? When do we get there? Is it still far? Will you shut up!? We're camping here tonight. Fix a fire. I don't know how. I was never taught. You mummy's boys don't know how to do anything. Pull my boots off. Come on, pull! Stronger, don't be a little girl. What a stumble-bum! Can't stand on two feet! We there soon? I'm hungry. Whose fault is that? You threw food into the river. You're lucky... You know what they are? Trapper footprints. They're loaded up. Three riders, two mules. The hunt must have been good. It'll be good for us too. You chat them up... and I'll pretend I'm injured. Once we gain their confidence, we nick their stuff... Got it? I'm not a thief. You're just playing weakling! "Ooh, I'm scared." We still have a week on the road. What are we going to eat? Help! Help! My brother Abigail is injured! I'm hurt! Please! My brother was attacked by a bear. Abigail... I start washing my hair in the river... I'm rubbing, rinsing... And when I look up... I see a cougar! I say to myself "I'm done for!" And suddenly, Samson arrives in his uniform. He's mounted on his horse. He shoulders his rifle and fires. The bullet went straight between its eyes. The cougar drops dead. I'll make a nice coat out of it. Hey, Marcus... I can just see their faces! I'm so smart! We'll sell the furs to pioneers. Why them? They're all suckers... and now you've made sure, it will be even easier. "All suckers"... Samson must have thought that. You're crazy! The trappers will be hot on our heels! - I'm going to take the furs back. - You can't do that! Stop! Give me the reins! Hey, that hurt! I'm not a thief... I don't cheat people! - And my parents are not rich. - What? No big house. No reward. Were you so stupid as to believe it? - Liar! - Thief! - Idiot! - That's you! - No, you! - Coward! Moron! - Cry-baby! - No, you're the cry-baby! - No, you! - No, you! I think I need to turn around. - Just be careful! - It's OK. Have to break this chain. Not happening? Stop! See in the middle? That's Pegasus. And if you come down here, that’s The Lizard. On the left, he big shiny one... That's The Swan . Excuse me... I'm looking for a man named Samson. Do you know him? Tell me when you're going !to turn round. - It's OK. - It's not! Look over there! - Cheerio, I won't miss you. - Me neither. Cheerio! Mummy, Mummy, hold onto me! There are a lot of Samsons. This one is a lieutenant in the 3rd Cavalry. In that case, go see the colonel. He's playing poker with the sheriff. So, have you decided? We don't have all afternoon. You don't fool me, Sheriff, you're bluffing. Mr colonel? Please, I'm looking for a scout... We're busy here! - I raise you 10. - See you. - Three kings. Too bad. Don't move... I want my revenge. Always a pleasure, Colonel. A soldier stole from me...! You again? Scram you cheeky brat! What are you playing at? Not such a big guy now, you Poo-brain! Just you wait...! Look at the colonel! Instead of sniggering, Sheriff, help me catch him! Stop right now! My sausages! Come here, you! Hi! Here we go! I've got you! They ought to be hanged! We'll teach them a lesson! Two weeks work ruined! - He nicked my watch! - Sheriff, that's impossible! Have you lost them too? Why did you want to come here? I'm looking for rat who did the dirty on me. I can help you if you like. We'll wait for a bit and get Hambone back, He's just a little way down there. Come on! What are you doing there? I don't like being made fun of! I'll flatten those fools! They're going to cop it, Colonel, mark my words! Come on, we'll go up this alley... They're sure to be close by. It's OK, they're gone now. I saw you were running away from the sheriff. But next time, you ask. Understood? - Yes, but... - Don't answer back! I've never seen a girl more badly brought up. He's not a girl. Of course she's a girl. Takes a boy not to tell the difference! Is it true? Are you a floozy? I'm no floozy! You must be... You've lied from the start! Floozy! That's enough. You both get off! But we don't know which way to go. Would you have some work for two orphans? I'm always in need of more hands. But no more squabbling. Whatever you say. Giddy-up! I'd say we'll be planting flowers in her garden. We were hoodwinked. Yeah, we should never have accepted. You there! Get to work! I can't go on. - I've had it! - Just a week more. Hey kids, keep moving... I'm famished. Are you from the 3rd Cavalry? Was. But gold mining pays more. Now, move along or get out of the way! Wait, do you know Lieutenant Samson? No. But the 3rd go to their winter quarters in two days. If you want to find him, you'll have to be quick about it. How will you reimburse me? You can't refuse my proposal. You owe too much money, Mrs Mustache. I shall find the gold vein. The latest results are positive. It's on the other side. - If your famous vein exists. - It exists. I studied geology for 5 years in Boston. No need for studies to know that here, the rock is hard... and that you have neither the men nor the equipment. Lend them to me. What if you can't find the vein? My offer is the best. You swindler! My concession is worth a lot more than that. Without the vein! Come on... Be sensible. You're in debt. Let me help you. I can't leave you on the verge of certain bankruptcy. I've come for my pay. You should knock before entering! You employ little girls? Yes and she is very efficient. Efficient, but badly brought up. On second thoughts... - That Poo-brain's unhappy. - Yeah. Fortunately you interrupted... I was about to do something stupid. You would have had more if you'd waited tonight. Why leave now? Is the work too hard? I want to find a rat who stole from me... Ma'am! What is it, Louis? It's Carson. He spoke to the workers, they've all departed. It's too cramped. And there's no way we can enlarge it. - I can get through. - It's too dangerous. It's a real labyrinth. I give up. You just need to pull me with this. Go to the end of the drive... Look for grey mud, and fill the box. - OK? - OK! Martha... Be careful. She's been too long... pull the rope. Oh my God! Martha! What can we do?! What is it? Did you notice something? Martha! I'm sorry, I lost the box. No matter... the main thing is you're safe. I messed up! I'm hopeless! You succeeded, Martha! You succeeded! You found the vein! So this is what a bathroom is?! Excuse me! It's okay, don't be shy. It's an extraordinary vein. Thanks, my beautiful girl! How can I thank you? I have to get to the 3rd Cavalry. They're leaving tomorrow. You embarrassed the colonel. He'll recognize you. I don't care, I want to see Samson. He must give back what he stole from me. Dress like a girl. Dress like a girl. The colonel won't recognize you. She's right . You were a boy, dress like a real girl. What do you mean "real girl"? I AM a real girl! I mean, in a dress, elegant and all... You mean... "Hello, Mr Sheriff..." "Would you have the time, please?" "Oh! You don't have a watch anymore?" "How annoying!" Yes, that's the way. I'd like to see you trying to walk in a frilly dress! - And these shoes? - Stop complaining. Look how pretty you are. You see? This dress fits you nicely. I don't care ! Why do boys always have better luck? Even with clothes? - You're in disguise. - I prefer the pants. You want to find your Samson? Stand up straight and smile. Lie down! Quiet now. You just stay there. It'll be OK. Try to stand up straight. Wait, I'll go ahead... Do as I do, and everything will be fine. Hello,Colonel. Colonel, meet my niece... Martha Jane. Your niece? My pleasure, Miss. Have we met before? At the spring ball, no doubt. My niece is looking for Lieutenant Samson, a cousin. Samson? Lieutenant? Yes indeed. - Go fetch him. - Yes, Colonel. In full preparation? We're going to our winter quarters. You wanted me, Colonel? This young girl is looking for you. No, he's not my cousin. Oh, that Poo-brain! He's taken me for a ride! "Poo-brain..."? Tank you very much, Colonel. Madam, are you leaving already? Yes, we are expected. Goodbye, Colonel. Hurry up Poo-brain... Poo-brain... You're lucky he didn't recognise you. What did I teach you?! Sorry, I always mess up. What is it, Pik? Stop! Calm down! Is it Samson? I think he can smell Samson. I'm going to see! No! Poo-brain... Poo-brain? The kid in the saloon! No, but...! Sorry! You! Come here! It's a general's uniform! What's going on? Pik? What are you doing here? One move and I sound the alarm! Your friends won't be happy to find out about this. Little thief! You're the thief! Give me back what you stole! What are you talking about? The kid in the wagon train! Thief ! Why did you rob us? I didn't steal anything! It was the kid. In my opinion, he was sweet on you. Ethan? Yes he came to see me and gave me everything so I'd leave. I made his father look weak. - You were on the right track. - You have to give them back to me. No, it's mine. Do I sound the alert? No, no... Alright. Take them back. Do you want the key? Yes, I do. You see, Samson isn't my real name. And you're not a 2nd lieutenant either. No, I'm a launderer. I'm a nobody. I wash, I rub. And I see those pretentious officers. One day, I put on one of their uniforms. People viewed me differently. I was someone else. You know that too, with your trousers. Hey, kid... You know, they're likely dead. They wanted to ford the Warm River. I told them it was impossible to ford. It didn't change their mind. So don't think about it anymore... And thanks for reuniting me with Pik. He helped you a lot. There you are, bugle-boy! We've looked for you everywhere. Colonel, I've found the bugle-boy. About time! Play us 17! I'll put you in the pit! Get on! Poo-brain! Thank you, Mrs Moustache. Take care of yourself, Martha Jane. See that...? It's gold. Magical, eh? Do you like it that much? Louis is going to teach me the trade. Wouldn't you like to become a gold-fossicker? Like Mrs Moustache... stay here? I can't. I have my family... And you? Where's yours? I don't have any. Where I was, us orphans were beaten. I don't want to go back there. I'm much better off here. You promised to help me. You can make it on your own. Very well then, I'm going. Cheerio. Wait! Here, Calamity! This will put a smile on your face. Thank you. It's you now, Ethan! Ethan! Help! Ethan! Ethan.. you OK? Nothing broken? Come and help us! No injuries? It's okay, everything is fine. Go and help the others! Thank you. Without you, we'd still be there. You saved my life. My name's Ethan. And you? My name's Calamity. Calamity Jane. Martha Jane? Martha Jane! Martha Jane! You're not with Mummy? No, my little chickadee. I've missed you so much! Lena! Don't be afraid, Lena. Go see your big sister. It's over now, pet. Everything will be OK. Martha... Oh, Martha! Oh, my daughter. My wonderful daughter! You're alive! Forgive me. I got back your stuff. You know, the theft, I was not responsible. Really. Ethan told us everything... when Paterson said you were dead. I wouldn't have doubted you. With those damn mountains... we'll have to find the right passes. That will avoid catastrophe. And I can guide you. You, Martha Jane?! So we avoid catastrophe? She was away 4 months, alone... going as far as Hot Springs. It's true, You'll make a good guide. From now on, you'll lead the way for us, Calamity Jane. And there, appearing like a ghost... I didn't hear it coming... Martha! My father sent me. To know if the road is good. Look! Martha... Here... I found it with my stuff. I'm very sorry. Do you know how to dismount from a horse? Like this! And... splat! Come on...! Forward! I've sucked on pebbles And bitten the dust My knees are scraped But I live in the great outdoors If you look for me, you find me But I'm just passing through Fossicker or stray dog Grab your hat, and follow me I've found maggots And cooked them in a stew My horse got trapped By a spider's web All that's been said about me What is true or not?
