It didn't look like it. But, um, they were getting into an argument, and the fire got started on the third floor, somehow worked its way all the way downstairs into the kitchen. William said, if I was walking down the street, he'd, uh, vote for McCain. Everybody was saying, "We know you ain't say that around the polls." You vote Obama? We know where you live at. - Okay. It was alive for the first time in, like, umpteen years down here. We need to get a meeting with this historian. Got to make sure this part, the bow's showing so the bow will be sticking out forward. You got to make, like -- But it all faces towards all the people? Well, it depends on which way you're going to be facing. 'Cause his shirt is pink. It's like a cotton-candy pink with white stripe. Why you wearing a pink shirt? Because your mother made me get it. Now, how do you want it up? - Nice, man. - Good? - Yeah, it's cool. - It's perfect. What's up, Kyle? - How you doing, man? - Hi, what's up, chief? Dear God, we thank you, and we bless you for this man and this woman. Together, they can conquer anything. Keep your hand on them, God. God, we pray in the name of Jesus that you do this not for our sake, God, but that you get the glory out of their lives. In Jesus' name we pray, for Christ's sake, amen. - Amen. - Amen. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you Mr. and Mrs... - Rainey. - ...Rainey. Yes. Is it done? Yeah. Just a little flap. Just gonna keep that water down. Which way do you want to go? Um...that way. I'm ready. - Cool? - Uh-huh. I'll be here to pick you up. All right? In our minds, we were already married, you know, just being together throughout the years and knowing that we both wanted the same things in life. We were both tired of the BS and the crap. That's for sure. - Yeah. Anytime you turn around, you know, you see couples going through arguments, people cheating on each other, just doing each other wrong, and both of us been down that road so many times in our past lives that when we actually did hook up and get together and start talking to each other, we came to the equal conclusion that that's not worth it. You know, you just need one person to love. We've been together for pretty much about 15 years, and when Chris and I first met, we had older children from previous relationships. You know, that are grown, doing their thing now and, you know, living their lives. P.J. is the one we had together, so she's the baby. Mm-hmm. Once we had P.J., that kind of solidified everything, you know? Mm-hmm. It's a left hand and a right hand, and they definitely work well together, you know, and I think that's how our relationship is. We definitely are total opposites on everything, pretty much. - Yeah. - You know? Because I don't like the TV shows he watch. And I sure don't like the ones she watch. You know, she's more like "CSI," crime stories and things like that. He likes cartoons. And I'm more or less the cartoons. - All night. - Yeah. I get away from the real world as much as I can because I'm always in the real world, so to speak.

Homeboy putting it down for the homies since, like, 19-whenever, whatever. We started the studio, what, 13 years ago. I've always played crowd control, so I'm pretty much like a mom to everybody. I don't want to be everybody's mom, but somewhere along the line, they just started calling me "ma." Hello? - Hi. - You got everybody tonight? - Yes, I do. - All right. Did you sign your...yet? - No. When you get a chance, can you do that for me? Okay. We have homeless women and children on-site, and it's our job to make sure these children are safe and the ladies here are safe. I'm always telling somebody what they supposed to be doing, what they should be doing, where they supposed to be at. I'm always feeling like I'm somebody's mom. Hey, babe. None, so I decided to take my 15. It's so quiet. I think it's going to be the most boring night ever. I don't mind. Boring is good. All right, I'm going to let you go, here, baby. I ain't going to hold you up. All right. I love you. Bye. And good evening to everyone out there. We're live in Philadelphia, New Jersey, Delaware, and other parts of the world. We have a lot to do here today in the studio, so we're going to get right down to it. We also have as our very special guest today brother Chris Rainey, one of Philadelphia's premier record promoters and producers. There's so much talent, so much genius come out of beautiful North Central Philadelphia. Yeah. Get up them damn steps. The step is the minimum. I love North Philly. This is the neighborhood that we lived in all our lives. We ballplayers down here. We're more about the streets and everybody just hanging out as a whole. When you do talk to people, you find out they're not as hard as they appear to be. Put a little kick into it. P.J. wants to be a deejay. Music is her life. We started it while she was in the womb. Like, at 3 months old, we could hold her while the music was on, and she actually would bounce to the beat of the music, like she had rhythm from the door. You was about 3 when you recorded your first song. Yeah. She's turning into a teenager. I don't like that. Can you just go back to being, like, 5, because you were, like, the coolest 5-year-old ever. I know. What's up, man? Nothing. How you doing, Mo? - Guess I'll be all right. - Mm-hmm. My oldest boy, William, he's 21. On my birthday this year, he went to the emergency room. He was having eye pains and a lot of different problems, so they did an MRI, and they found a tumor on his brain pressing on his pituitary gland. His hair was about a foot long two months ago. That's when he found out it was cancerous. He's scared. I'm scared for him. His girlfriend was pregnant before we found out he had cancer. I think the baby gives him a little hope. He's gotten really good at holding his head up, Will. Bless you. I never thought I'd feel this way. I knew I would love my grandchild, but I didn't know it was going to feel like this, like, this deep. But it's, like, the good and the bad, just the cancer and the baby. It's hard. There's a lot of other things that go along with life, and, like, I got to balance being a mom and raising my teenager. She's 13. Um... Lots of people in the house, my job... It's tiring, but as a mom, all we can do is, like, roll with the punches and deal with it. - What's up, homie? - He got all these clothes that he ain't going to be able to wear in, like, two weeks. He's growing out of everything so fast. Like, them black boots up there, they're size zero. He might not even be able to fit them right now. I hope that after the chemo and the radiation is done that I can go and try to become a fireman or a nurse or something so we don't have to keep living with people. I'm hoping that I get a good job soon so that he doesn't have to see what struggling feels like. ♪ I'm the master, I'm the master ♪ ♪ I'm the master, I'm the master of ceremony ♪ ♪ I'm the master of rites, I'm the master ♪ ♪ I'm the master of ceremony ♪ ♪ I'm the master of ceremony ♪ ♪ I'm the master of ceremony ♪ ♪ I'm the master of ceremony ♪ ♪ I'm the master of ceremony ♪ ♪ I'm the master, I'm the master of ceremony ♪ ♪ Ever since I knew how to rap ♪ ♪ It's been the real...about what I'm going through ♪ ♪ What real niggas feel so they can relate to it ♪ ♪ Other niggas saying, hating me, and doubting me ♪ ♪ But I kept on writing music ♪ ♪ In the process of getting mad money ♪ ♪ But for now, as I speak, I'm still hungry ♪ ♪ Price is legendary ♪ ♪ Yeah, Price is legendary ♪ ♪ Understand I'm concerned about being ignored ♪ ♪ But most of all, I want to change ♪ ♪ 'Cause Price got soul ♪ ♪ Get it from my wife, my son, my little girl ♪ ♪ Wouldn't trade my son for all the riches in the world ♪ ♪ Or all the possessions in the Earth ♪ ♪ Before I'm in a hearse, I release my music ♪ ♪ I want to really work, and I'm taking affirmative action ♪ ♪ I'm an MC, I ain't a rapper ♪ ♪ Confused, don't get it ♪ ♪ Niggas hating now more than the critics ♪ ♪ I'ma drop this album 'cause they're waitin' ♪ ♪ I'm soon to be nominated, soon to be nominated ♪ ♪ I'm the master, I'm the master ♪ ♪ From the karaoke, I'm the master ♪ ♪ Freestyle from the karaoke to the booth ♪ ♪ From the -- From the ♪ ♪ Everything's starting to change ♪ ♪ Everything's starting to change ♪ ♪ Everything's starting to change ♪ ♪ Pain to draw my feeling deep inside my soul ♪ ♪ I can't see myself living old, living old ♪ You used come -- I'd say, "Price, come to the studio.

But then, when I see you, I only see the drunk side. I never see the sober side anymore. I'm still drinking, you know, like, real heavy. You know, I admit. You know, but, um, at the same time, as far as, like, other substances, I'm not -- I'm not... It's hard when you down here and you trying to get up here, so, like, that's where I'm at now. Like, I feel as though, like, I have -- I don't know what to believe, to be honest with you. We did hundreds and hundreds of songs together. I know what he's capable of. He should have been out there. Like, he would have been one of the greats right now. I think if Price would have stayed sober, I think we would probably have been somewhere a little bit further off into the music business, a little bit deeper. Must... - Glass of water? - ...get doctor. - You want the doctor? Yep. You all right? Oh. He just looks really cool. He's not ready to be a father yet. He really can't focus a lot. He just needs to talk to his wife about that a little bit more and, like, get her to understand it, you know, because she's always at work. But it's not easy for her, either. Hard to believe -- scenes of tragedy and destruction in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. You're looking at what's left of part of Breezy Point, New York. I hope each and every one of you had a wonderful weekend this past weekend. I hope each and every one of you are ready to go to the polls on Tuesday and vote your choice. In fact, I'll be glad when Tuesday is over. I mean, we have been bombarded with -- - Yeah. - And this whole birth-certificate thing is Donald Trump. This is, like, driving me crazy. A lot of people have, like, racist stickers on their car. It's a picture on Facebook, too, also where Barack has a noose around his neck. - Oh, man. - Yeah. All this noose imagery too. Yeah. Voter-suppression efforts -- we were talking about that a little bit earlier, the voter ID and the intimidation at the polls. Good morning, everyone, and if you're watching this for your election-day forecast and more, Katie's in the weather center. Good morning. Yeah, good morning, Eugene. You know, we've got a pretty calm election day, but it's a cold morning out there -- still a lot of readings into the 20s on our temperature map, so make sure you bundle up for whatever your day has in store besides getting out to the polls. In the end, both campaigns told us the same thing -- It's razor-edge close. See, I didn't do nothing I was planning on doing today. Already. You were the reason for my status this morning. What I say? What you say? What? "Not feeling my daughter this morning. If she were running for president, I wouldn't vote for her." Say if I really ran for president... If you ran for president, the world would think I'm a crazy person because I would be running down the street screaming, "Vote for P.J.!" You know? That's what we was doing for Obama. It was a bunch of us. They say they was going to have people standing in line to overcrowd the voting parties and try to make people not vote, try to frustrate people on voting... - Really? - ...or try to sway people votes. You have to pay people to do that. That's what they do. That's what they said. We was talking about it on the radio the other day. - That they what? - Find ways to frustrate you or to sway your opinion. You are good to go, sister. Mommy said my new curfew is 6:00. Why 6:00? Because it's Daylight Savings Time. Oh, and it gets darker, yeah, a lot faster. Yeah, but it's no point in having a curfew at 6:00. I mean, I might as well stay in the house all the time and just, like... I don't get home until, like, 4:30, and then it take me a couple, like -- and it take me a while to do my homework and stuff. Welcome to route three, service to... A lot of people say, you know, their neighborhoods were tough, but North Philly definitely is a tough neighborhood. P.J. has, you know, a curfew. She has to be in at a reasonable time. She's rebellious about it, but she doesn't disobey me. Good morning. I lived in the Diamond Street projects when I was younger. It was always rough around there. Crack came to Philly, like, 1983. They was getting kids like us to sell it. As time went on, I started seeing what it was doing to some of the people in our communities. People started fighting over it. People started killing over it. Knowing friends would be around one day, and then hearing that they died the next day, you could get tired of that. When I was growing up, our dad wasn't really around, but I was fortunate, you know? My mom really raised us right. She taught me, instead of doing something destructive, do something constructive. Bob Schieffer, one of the states... They're talking about each state. ...that will tip the balance for one of these men tonight is the state of... They're saying Romney most likely going to get Virginia. Obama most likely going to get Ohio. African Americans that go to Iowa win. People said, "Wait a minute. This guy might be somebody who's going to win." Let me just take a short pause. Bear with me one second while CBS News projects. Ohh! "CBS News projects Obama re-elected." They out there celebrating. Dang, man. I wish my mom would've seen this. She'd have been tripping.

Yeah, hood, yeah, the low-rider swing beat. It's a swing beat. It's like this. That's what it is. They like that swing beat. Easy for them to get to. The majority of those who died today were children, beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them -- birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. As a country, we have been through this too many times. Whether it's an elementary school in Newtown or a shopping mall in Oregon or a temple in Wisconsin or a movie theater in Aurora or a street corner in Chicago, these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods, and these children are our children. Don't let 'em take that ball. Don't let 'em take the ball. Chris had just got out of the shower. When I opened the door, Portia, the little girl from around the corner, was running towards me, screaming, "P.J. got shot." So, like, all I can do is scream at the top of my lungs and run in the direction she's talking about. Now, mind you, the shoot-out was to the left, a whole block away. P.J. was to the right, a whole block away. In my eyes, P.J. was on 22nd Street in a playground playing basketball like she always do. Hey, Mom. - Hi. Still in surgery right now. We're waiting for them to tell us that she's out. Man. They removed the bullet, or she lost the eye permanently? All right. Ready? Take your -- Take your time, baby. Take your time. I've got you. I'm going to put this on your arm, sweetie. It's okay. You're gonna be out of the hospital soon. So, see that white car right there -- on the left side of the street, left side of the street, down the block? She was right there when I went there to go -- - Shh. - When I found her. Where I ran around the corner. She says she was crossing Hamburger Street walking straight here. She had turned the corner. She had turned right here. She had turned right here, and she was walking this way. The surgery went well. Okay, that's good. That's good. They put the eye in and everything. - She all right? - Yeah. She going to be coming home either Friday... - Or Saturday. - ...or Saturday. - Or Saturday. - Or Saturday. - One of the two. - And we going to try to do something on the block for her, I mean, so everybody can come around and stuff. She want deviled eggs, mac and cheese, cranberry sauce, and corn. What? She want deviled eggs, mac and cheese, cranberry sauce, and corn. Definitely. Okay. - Hey, fellas. - Mr. Chris? - Yes, sir. - Need us for anything? Yeah. We going to clean the block in a little bit and just, like, try to give her a little welcome-home thing. She going to be coming home Saturday. - Say when? Saturday? - Saturday, yeah. - We'll be there wherever. - Okay. Thank you, fellas. Thank you very much. All right, y'all. - They got the bullet out? - Yeah. They took the bullet out. It was no problem. Had a little bit of nerve damage inside of there, but they said everything all right, though. She's not going to be able to see out of there, right? Going to look like she can see out of it, and it's going to move just like a regular eye, but she ain't going to be able to see out of it, no. She going to look like it's normal again? Yep. She look left, it's going to look left. She look right, same thing. - That's good. She going to be able to cry out of it and everything. She got to wear them type of glasses. The doctor described a strap around the back because they have to make sure that nothing happens to the other eye, and she going to hate them glasses. Come on. You keep going up there, sitting by her door. What -- What neighborhood do you consider this? Is this still -- Is this Brewerytown, or what is...? North Philly. Excuse me. It's her left eye. - Her left eye. - Yeah. The way she described it, what she said is, she heard the shots. She looked around, and she saw the smoke down the street, but when she looked, the bullet -- it felt like a rock hit her in the eye. Just seems like nobody cares about this little section of the city except for the police officers doing their job. You know, other than that, the only time politicians come down here, if they building a new building, for what? But so they can build another prison or a casino? They have no problem getting a license for a casino, but I only ask for is to have somebody there after school so the kids can have something to do. It's ridiculous. She blaming herself for getting shot. I mean, I'm blaming myself because I let her, you know what I mean, be out here. When I see my child bleeding from her face, screaming, "Daddy, I'm sorry for getting shot," what do you say to that? Be safe, brother. Definitely. I tell you, this world really turned into something that really don't care about nothing. It's crazy. Don't care about nothing these days. Young boys shooting, they putting casinos in nigga neighborhoods and getting rid of the...schools. It's crazy. I hear these shots every day. Every day, I go out there just to make sure ain't nobody I know. I never thought I'd go out there for my child. It's like I just, like... watched my daughter's life change instantly. And probably maybe two more steps closer, she could've been dead -- probably a half an inch closer. It could've penetrated the back of her skull. Lay your head down. Lay it down. This feels sticky. It's tacky. - Don't put it on the edge of it. - I know. As long as it don't touch the tape and don't run, it's cool. It's all right, baby. - P.J. - It's Tim. - P.J. - You want to see Tim? Your mom told you about Aunt Sila's husband? He was playing. He was about your age, and ran into a bush. It went straight through his eye. He lost his eye, but now he's riding motorcycles. He's the top IT person for the city of Philadelphia. - I'm not good at -- - He drives a dirt bike. Mnh-mnh. Anything you put your mind to, you can do. Oh, boy. Don't let nobody never tell you you can't. - Goodbye to you guys. - It's right back? Let me know if you see one of your friends. I see that's who you looking for, to see if you see somebody. Oh, they on the basketball court. We should ride around here real quick. They on the basketball court. You ready? Hmm? You sure? Yes, Dad! - Okay. - Come on down home now. Come on, Tim. I been praying for you, baby. You been on my mind since the thing happened. All right. It'll be all right. This'll be moist, and that will be moist, so they went and they attached it, let the bones grow together and everything. - P.J.! - What's up? Wanted to ask you about -- you know, about your... I would like to invest in some awnings for this house. This a moment where I miss our tree. Yeah, I miss the tree. - The tree, yeah. The tree definitely was shady. And I just wanted to let you know that you're still beautiful, and God loves you. It was God's way of something happening to God be the glory, and know that, at the end of the day, that you are beautiful no matter what. No matter what, you -- - She is gorgeous. She knows she's beautiful. - Mm-hmm. Aw, look at the pretty girl. She wants to go in the house. - Okay. - Aw. Smile! You're still pretty. Look how pretty she is. Smile, pretty girl, smile. Let me see that smile. What's the matter, baby? You all right? Everybody gettin' on you -- You want some quiet time? Huh? You know what I'm saying, you want everybody to stay out your face? Everybody keep making, like, a big deal. "You're still pretty." I know. Oh, my God. I know I'm not ugly. I'm not worried about my eye. Y'all just make me think about my eye more. "You're still pretty. You're not ugly. Don't worry. Smile." Reminding me of it again. You talking about that lady? - Yeah. - Yeah. She was a little... - She crazy. I mean, everything she said, she meant well, but some things, it's just not even -- You don't feel like talking about them. Mm. I thought you wasn't going to make it. Well, you bad. I'm going to beat you. Yeah, I bet... No. I think I can shoot better, though. I don't know why. It feels -- It feels different. - Let me try. - You want to try? Oh! You don't know how to play basketball at all? I can't play basketball. I got two left feet. Somebody could have been on 22nd Street, and they would've died from that bullet. For it to just stop where it stopped and not go any further, it's got to be more than just luck. That's why I told you, you got to go to church because you got to thank somebody else and not thank me for saving your life. I just want a picture. You don't want a picture of me. Yes, I do. Hello. - I'm just happy you smiling. - Mr. Chris! Yo, girl, you got me messed up right here. You look like you okay, and I'm not. That's the problem. Hell, why is you crying? I love you. - I love you, too. - Give me a hug. - You keep hugging me. - Ah, I love you. - I'm okay. - You okay? Yes. I'm going to stop asking you that. - Yeah. She says -- - Today is gonna be the only day I'm gonna ask you, "Are you okay?" over and over again. Okay? - Okay. Not even give P.J. a hug. Yeah. He was there he crying. Hi.

We're definitely not keeping her in a shell, making sure that she has room to... - Grow... - ...grow... - ...and live her life. - ...and live her life, and, like, dealing with the realization of her balance and, like, equilibrium, getting to learn through all that over again.

She says, "Nothing going to stop me," but she needs time to -- like, to heal mentally... Okay. That's right. ...and that's where we at with her. I'm healing mentally. I'm telling you the truth. We are. We are. 'Cause I love your family tremendously, but I'm glad to see that you are coming through this, you and your very strong wife. - Yeah. Thank you very much for that. My wife, she's such a strong woman. Actually, I haven't even seen her break down yet, you know, so, you know, we all have our time for that. - Yeah. - You know, I just hope I'm in the right place at the right time to be there with her. - That's right. At first, sleeping was hard. Then there's the anger. You don't know whether to cry, be mad, go kill somebody. When we first came home, for her to get up the first morning and come downstairs, and me to see the patch on her eye and remember that that was real, that wasn't a dream, there's anger, and there's sadness and confusion and just, like, a whole fire in my heart, because it shouldn't have happened to her. She didn't deserve it. Some people don't get it when I be trying to tell them about what happened to me. Look at my arms. It's not a joke. Look at my legs. When I was 18 years old, I ran through a fire. My weave literally melted to my hair. My fingernails and toenails started detaching from my body. I went in my basement one night to get some clean clothes so I could leave out, and, well, when I got down there, my nose and my eyes started burning, and, well, it was like the wind blew one time -- whoosh. Everything around me was on fire. All my skin had bubbled up by that point. I had never seen nothing like that -- like, that light spot I got right there covered all of this. All of this was just completely pink -- my face, everything. And I remember, one day, about two or three months later, that that started filling in. It took about 16 years for me to get all this color back, and all I can say for real is, God is good all the time. What I got to do for you to send me copies? No, where your music that I gave you? I just had -- I was high at the time. You always high. If I get my music for the one last time, you should be able to say, "Okay, Price." I'm asking now for months! All I see right now is you asking me to take another chance on you before -- No. All you see right now is the old me, the old me, the person who used to come in, take his music, get high, lose it. Yeah. That's what I'm trying to tell you. I'm not that same guy. I'm trying to make you see the new me. All right, but listen. New you is -- My music must really mean a lot to you. That's right. - That's what it is. - Yep. Yep. So, if my music really mean a lot to you, how much you think it mean to me? So why you throw it away? Why you ain't got it? Why -- - I ain't got it... - Where are your responsibilities? ...because I had an addiction at the time. Where are your responsibilities? But I'm changed now. It's the truth. It's the truth. I had an addiction. I'm over that now. If I was the engineer and you was the artist, and you kept messing up, I would give you that extra hand. I would lift out to you because I would know the history we have. I know all the times we spent in the studio recording, constantly going in. I remember that. - Exactly. Can I speak now? All right. I remember that, too, so why do you think I just want to throw that away like you do? If you so careless and carefree about when I give you something that you don't have no respect for me when I say, "I'm not going to give you another copy," and then you still come here and ask for another copy, what respect do you got for me? Because you know I'm a chump and I'm going to give it to you? 'Cause you can't -- 'cause this is not the first time, it's not the second time, it's not the third time, it's not the fourth time, it's not the fifth time, it's not the sixth time. - No, don't cross the sixth. - Come on now. - It's the fifth. - Come on. Let's be real. I'm borrowing the sixth. You borrowing the sixth. - Let's be real. - No. Yeah. - Are you invested in me? - I'm -- Yeah! - And I'm invested in you? - Yeah! I'm not letting my music go out like that no more. - Listen. - No. - Let's start over. - Nope. Nobody made more albums than me. - Price. - Nobody. - Price. - Nobody made more albums. Why wouldn't you want to do business with a nigga like that? But what I'm trying to tell you is, how many times, like, I give you something before you -- Last time. - Price, come on. - I had an addiction. I had an addiction. - I had an addiction. Well, you know how the addiction is. Exactly. I know exactly how it is. - It's hard to deal with. - Right. I had an addiction. The music that I know now, I would take it to the whole, fullest extreme. I wasn't the same way I was a couple months ago. He lost his wife... his kids... their house... his -- his whole career here. I need two people here. - Right here? - In here. I need one person, need a body right here. Anything, any row. - Go! - Make them come back. - Let's go! I'm not going to repeat myself. I'm not coming in here tomorrow. I am not losing this contract because people want to run a race. Okay? You're not taking food off our our family's table because y'all in a hurry. - Anybody need bags? - I need bags. Okay. Now you can put your headphones in, the whole nine yards, and it'll stay dry. - Keep 'em dry? - Yeah. Thank you. We gotta come all the way up? - Yeah, two times. - Two. Pharrell! How far we up? Okay. Get that strength. Get that strength. It's all right. I know how you feel, babe. Well, I don't know how you feel, really. I know it's something to go through. - Straight up. - Good. Do you want to hold it here? Just hold steady. - Hold steady. I got the hand. - It won't hurt you. You'll just feel it. One -- Let's count. One, two... Okay. It really hurts. - Okay. It's in. - It's in. Here's a tissue. Here you go. That's probably why it hurt, the way you squeeze your -- Let me make sure your eyelashes are turned out. Okay. Is it? Yeah. I think so. Hmm. Think so. She's squinting because it's tight. She doesn't like the way it feels, but you'll get used to it. You okay? You okay? You're doing fine. - You feel achy? - Yeah. Okay. How you feeling? You can see how it's open more? Mm-hmm. Definitely. But this eye can adjust this and move this inward towards her -- move it in towards her nose. Going to be a little straighter. Just get it... Last week, a young man was shot and murdered. It traumatized the community. Now, prior to that, in the summertime, two other gentlemen got shot and murdered here in our community. What are the reasons why people are still trying to take over these corners and kill each other? It's, you know, senseless. Nine times out of nine, most of the killings that's going on now is the same guy that you ate peanut butter and jelly with, same guy that you played football with out in the snow. There's a better way. You have to have something to offer them. You got to have something to offer them. Blacks in the community, come out, especially those that feel hostage in their own home. Me and my son made this last night. - Morning, Judge. - Hey, Kim. Good morning to you. - Good morning, Father. - How you feel, baby? - Morning. Morning. Peace in the street. Take care of your neighbor. Love your brother. Love your sister. - Stop the violence! - Increase the peace! - Stop the violence! - Stop the violence! - Stop the violence! - Stop the violence! - Increase the peace! - And stop the violence! - Increase the peace! - And stop the violence! Eternal God, we thank you for this wonderful day. We thank you for this community, and we're praying for its health and safety and security. Amen. Amen. When a gun is fired in our community, it ain't only killing Christians, it ain't only killing Muslims. It's killing all of us. So we must come together. We should be creating a movement. That's right. I appreciate the politicians coming out here for a soundbite. Where they at now? I appreciate all that, but when they're gone, and they come in here and ask for your vote, we the only ones that's dealing with this blood on our concretes. We the only ones that dealing with those mothers that got to bury their babies that never realized their full potential. They're getting younger and younger. Our last one was a 13-year-old baby. 13! He haven't even begin to dream. How did Meek Mill and Jay-Z become our leaders? Where are Meek Mill and Jay-Z at now? To the young girls, where are Rihanna, Beyoncé? Where they at now? Our first role models should be us. What's up, P.J.? What you up to? I heard you working. - She got her ears on now. - Huh? - Mr. Davis talking to you. - What did you say? - I said, "What's up?" What's been going on? I hear you working. - Yeah. - Yeah. How you like your job? It's all right. I'm trying to get my granddaughter a job, man. Oh, yeah. - You need help with anything? - Yeah. Do these earrings go with that necklace? I mean, they blue. - Which ones? See the blue? You lazy. - How am I lazy? - She said, "Donations," and then you're going to walk back there. Unh-unh! Why are you laughing at me? Hey. I used to just like people, but I just never said anything. I was scared what people was going to think. And then that's when, like, in eighth grade -- that's when everybody, like, really knew. But my dad, he was like, "I noticed that you been hanging around gay people all of a sudden, and it's obvious, and, like, are you gay?" And I was like, "Mm. I guess." I don't hide it. And this time of day, it's like the whole generation gay. Like -- Like, everybody just... I mean, some people just do it because they think it's like a fad, but, like, they just be trying to follow along, but I'm not doing it because of that because, I don't know, I really think I am. ♪ Raven hair ♪ One day, she had something around her neck, something a friend gave her, and I said, "Where'd you get that from?" She said, "From my girlfriend," so I said, "Your girlfriend, or your girlfriend, girlfriend?" And she looked at me like, " Come on, Mom. My girlfriend." I don't know what to say. Like, what can you say? You know, I don't want to be the rebellious parent, like, "You're not going to be like that," because you can't tell somebody what they going to be when they grow up. It's just, long as it doesn't change what's going on in my household... Right. ...I can't complain about it. It's not my right. There's so many levels of being gay now. It's, like, you know, I thought it was just either you gay or you not. You know, now you -- just added a third gay, or you're... LGBT. And what's the other two? I forget. Next week, I want to take her to Deana and get her hair done because, as I explained to her, "You are stuck with this picture." But I'm going to ask Deana to do it because -- Why? You keep saying -- I notice you keep saying, "Deana." Why Deana? - Let me finish. - I -- You know -- The reason why she went the direction she went is because, every time I had an idea, you disagreed, and she agreed, and then y'all accused me of not doing enough with her when you reinforced everything I ever tried to do with her. Please stop blaming me for what your children went through... I love you with all my heart. ...because it's not my fault that she... - I'm not saying... - I didn't change her mind. ...it's your fault or you changed her mind. - You just did. - But every time I try to do -- Majority of the time, when I try to do something that was some type of feminine with my child... - Don't do that to me. - ...Daddy always intervene... Don't put me in the middle of what you and P.J.'s -- what she doing. Well, all I'm asking you to do is stop disagreeing, and let me do something with her. Instead of you using your boy idea, let her run with being a girl for a change. Mm-mm. Remember when she was 2 years old and you bought her a little plaid boy outfit? - Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm. - Anyway... - Hmm, hmm, hmm. - ...that's real crazy. No, what's real crazy is the fact that... - Can I wash your hair, then? - ...you want to blame me for everything that you didn't do with P.J., like I just stopped P.J. and you from living y'all entire life. That's what's crazy. Maybe one thing here and there, but that did not decide her fate of what she's doing. Mm. Right now, I'm kind of just living life day by day, not even thinking about the future. I'm still dealing with side effects of the cancer. You know, I still have swollen hands, and I have... My whole body's kind of swollen. When I was getting my radiation, I was looking at a waste bin in a hospital, and I just felt radioactive at the time, so I got this tattoo. It means biohazard or infectious waste, because it's how I feel all the time -- like a waste of space, you know? I'm frustrated. Every day. And it's hard to deal with it. They really just pulled my man over. - What're you doing? - Yeah. It's my husband, so I'm going to make sure my husband is all right. This is crazy, man. Move out the way. You in the way. Did something happen around here? Somebody bad that look like him. What? Everybody... No, I don't know what to do. You -- Listen. Last time -- - I just told you. All right. All right. Okay. - What's your last name? - Rainey. - Rainey? - Rainey, R-A-I-N-E-Y. What they say? - You fit the description. I fit the average description of the character -- jeans, yeah, white shirt, baseball cap, jeans. I'm like, "That's, like -- like, every person in this neighborhood, everybody's neighborhood." Like, I know they know they got the wrong person because they didn't seem like they was alarmed. But he said it three times, and he got more aggressive every time he said it. - Yeah. That's what made me feel the urgency to pull my camera out because I saw that he was already agitated. I guess that, well, they figured, you know, I mean, they needed somebody to check, you know? Everybody is a suspect until proven innocent. It's just that once I hear the beat, this is how it's going to run down. Oh... This a fresh one? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. This how we going to do that. Uh-huh.
