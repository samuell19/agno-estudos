Hey Nhung, Which one is better? This or that? All! All! This, and this. I'll take it all. Huh, these are all male clothes. Don't you like it? Yes, I do. Just take it. LAWYER MINH Your Grandma had a stroke and passed away, please come back to Vietnam ASAP to attend the funeral. Lord, welcome into your presence your daughter Maria Tran Thi Ngoc, bless her with all your saints in the glory of resurrection. We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen! Why didn't you wait for me? Grandma! I'm going out. Hey Nhung, I have a headache. Get me some water to take some medicines. Yes, Madam. Grandma!!! Stay home and have lunch with me. Granny. Please please let me go. I'm running late for my flight. Granny, granny! Nhung, Nhung! Missy, Missy, your grandma's lawyer is here. Wake up Missy! You're too loud. Chairman has some words for you. Mrs. Ngoc T. Tran - Chairman oi Le Nina Group possessed 51% shares of the company, 4 villas in HCMC, a farm in Long Thanh District, a resort in Nha Trang, and 600 billion VND. All of these are left for her granddaughter Nhung K. Tran, on one condition that graduates from a special 3-month course in Tu Tam Institution, taught by Ms. Lai T. Nguyen. Otherwise, all of the property will be donated to charity. What? Give me that. All of the property? All of this is legal, signed and stamped by Madam Chairman. My Grandma would never have done this. She just passed away and now you want to betray her already? I'd never accept this condition. Get out! She'll pay for this. I'm sorry this card is denied. Try to eat something. You seem tired lately. LE NINO FASHION GROUP'S CHAIRMAN WILL DONATE ENTIRE OF WEALTH TO CHARITY I'm going out to make a phone call. - You can't take this. This belongs to my Missy. - Let's go! Let it go! It is my duty. Please, let's go! If my Missy loses this, she I said "Let's go!" No, you let go. Let's go. Give it back to me. I'm simply doing my duty. Give my Missy's purse back! Hey. What are you guys doing? They are taking your Miu Miu away, Missy. - Let it go! - Let it go! I'm from the Asset Valuation Company. Here is the document. (Hey Miss)! Get out. Get out of here! Go away! Get out of my house. I forbid all of you, I forbid all of you to touch anything in this house. Otherwise, don't call me cruel. Get out! Sen, bring me my cell. Here you are Missy. Where are you? Come to my house immediately. I'm here. All of this is being executed as your Grandma's will. If you want to inherit her legacy, you'll have to complete that cours in Tu Tam institution. There's no other way but to simply obey. Ahhhh! Sen (He") me! Missy, What are you doing here? Missy, are you drunk again? Okay, okay! Put your head here. Sit up, Missy. Missy, sit up! Come, come with me! Where, Missy? To Tu Tam Institution. About that... Come to Tu Tam with me. I'll give you fancy clothes to wear, fancy clothes to wear. Fancy clothes? Okay. I'll come with you. WHAT'S THE STATUS? HOW IS SHE? SHE IS LEAVING. Hail Mary, full of grace the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary. Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen! In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen! Yeah! Wow! Your purse and coats are so beautiful! Get away from me! Stay away from me. - Stick with me. - Don't run too fast! This duck is so big. Stop it! Go away! Stop. Stop it! The first thing to know when you come to this school is that wearing high heels is not allowed. Mrs. Lai? Auntie, she called it a duck. Is it not right? That is a goose. A goose, a goose. Be quiet! You have so many things to learn here, or you'll learn nothing. Please consider studying here very carefully. Me - Nhung, I never surrender. I can do anything if I want to. Well, Let's see! Huh? Do I have to feed these pigs? I don't expect that you can do it. Missy, I can't do this either. After this course, you'll be able to feed pigs, plant trees, do the cooking and the laundry. Auntie, I'm not inheriting anything, I don't have to do anything of this, right? Sen, we have to share joy and sorrow with each other. Then when you get your inheritance, you'll share it with me, right? Okay, I'll give you some clothes, but you'll have to serve me your whole life. C'mon, Missy! Everything has just started. My Grandma's will is going to help me through this savage course. You still have so many things to learn. Go to the kitchen. Ahh, a rat, rat! There's a rat! Ah worm, worm! There's a worm. 123, let's go. Oh dear! Please act like a real lady. Ahhh! Missy, calm down Missy. - Where are you going? - I'm getting outta here. I don't wanna be here anymore, even for just a second. But Missy, your house has been seized already. Then we're going to your house. My house? It's not even as good as here. There's neither toilet nor food there. If so, we're going to a hotel. But you have no money left for staying at a hotel. Should we sell Miu Miu, Missy? Tidy up. It's night time already. Why are you making such a mess, Sen? I knew it. Wake up, wake up. There's a thief. I remember locking the door already. I knew this place must have a problem. Wake up Missy, mrs. Lai's here! Mrs. Lai is here. Wake up! Auntie Lai is here. Auntie Lai? Why are YOU up so early? Early? Do you even know what time it is? It's cooking time. We are easy-going, we can have anything for lunch. There's no need to make it complicated. But we have to cook for the kids. Are you going to let them starve? The kids could do with some bread. I'm telling you, last night there was an "assassin" who tried to break in my room. I stayed up all night to watch out for this girl. Now I'm so tired. What? Assassin? Where's the assassin, Missy? Where's the assassin? Assassin? Stop talking nonsense and get up now. You have to come downstairs to cook. Or was there a ghost last night? Here's your money. It's enough, you don't have to count. I'm leaving now, enjoy guys. What? Is it enough to play tonight? I already lost everything last night. This is for paying off my debt. What are you planning to do? What else can he do? His "gold mine" was taken into exile. She can no longer give him money. Don't worry guys, her family's crazy rich. It doesn't make sense if her grandma gives all of her money to charity. Am I right? Exactly, don't worry, I already have plans for this Lady. I'm so sleepy now, I stayed up all night to watch out for you. Hey, the paint is all over my head. Don't you know how to be careful? How can I wash it off? I'll kill you if I'm bold after this. Missy, don't be so furious. You haven't been bold yet. He's such a handsome man! You! Hey, I'm not finished. Where are you going? Ahh You're so smitten with boys. Oh gosh, the paint won't come off. I think you may have to shave your head. Are you crazy? What an unfortunate day! To meet such a graceless and impolite guy. Next time I see him, I'll pour a bucket of paint over his head. I really look forward to meeting him again. What are you saying? Nothing! Easy Sen. I just told you to be gentle with my hair! What is this smell? It's gasoline. Sen! Why did you let this man touch my head? Let's go of my hair, let's go! Why are you doing this? If this causes hair loss, I'll kill you! You can kill me after I'm done washing it. - Let's go of me! - Hold her hands. OK sir. I'll do whatever you tell me to do. Sen, Sen, help me Sen. Are you betraying me now Sen? I'll pull out your tooth and feed it to the fish. I'll sacrifice everything. For you! Sen! Ahhhh, help me! I'm listening. Everything is under control. Don't worry, I know it! Aaaaaa... Give it to me! No, this is mine too. Viet Anh made it for both of us. No! No! Break it up! Go away! You're too loud. You look like Medusa! Hey kiddo, no one has ever talked to me like that. You don't believe that I'm gonna hit you with my knees, do you? You're so stubborn and naughty. Here you are, have some grapes, take it outside, be good so I can work here. Stop messing around here! Please come in! This is Nhung, our new volunteer. Hey children, say hello to our guests. Good morning Sir and Madam! Good morning Sir and Madam! What the heck are you wearing? This is not a fashion runway. It's my very first day at school, I have to look beautiful. Today, I'm very punctual. Remember to give me bonus points for being so elegant. Let me tell you something! If you want to attend this catechism class, the first thing to bear in mind is that. Inner beauty is so much more important than appearance. Next time if you dress like this, don't even think about being here. Madam, I have a suggestion. Could you please install a heater in this classroom? I'm freezing in here. Let alone the hungry mosquitos, there are so many of them. We should use the essential oil diffuser to relax our minds as well, to avoid malaria for the kids. From now on, if you ever request anything unreasonable again, I'll kick you out of this classroom. No one forces you to stay here. It's so sunny and warm. Elevating Vietnamese beauty. It smells so good, just like a Western lady. Oh my dear! I'm screwed. O.M.G My babies, my blood-sisters. Why are you lying here like this? Miu Miu, oh my Miu Miu, are you alright? My Miu Miu, please wake up honey. I'm so sorry my baby. Please wake up, honey. It's so cruel to use lipsticks this way. Get out, get out! Sister! Please let me borrow your coral lipstick, I like it so much! Get out! Leave the shoes and coat! She's just a kid anyway, do you have to be so angry? It's easy to say so when these things aren't yours. It's not easy to purchase them even if you really want to. They are just some clothes and makeups, don't be that selfish! Yeah right. Only crude people like you would think of them as clothes, my clothes are not for ordinary people. Look at you ordinary person, messy hair, dirty outfits, not only tall but also huge. Are you nuts? Rude people looking down on others like you can't be compared to a rustic girl even if you're covered with gold. Rustic? You call this rustic? It's so charismatic. What drinks do you want? Do you have Western wines? No, I don't. I just have infused wine. Please give me a cup of hot tea. Just a second. Missy, here's your drink. Thank you Madam. There's Nhung, Nhung, Nhung, It's Nhung, Nhung! Nhung, where are you going? Nhung, where have you been? We've been looking for you. Looking for me? Hey Nhung, it's been just a few days, why do you look so dreadful? Hey, we're planning on a serious business. Would you like to join us? What serious business can you guys do? We're planning to open a night club, but still lack a little money. Do you have any? Throw in a few billion and I'll send you profits monthly. You don't need to do anything, let us earn money for you. Okay? Money? I have full of it. But I'll never invest in you guys. I'm still sane. Hey, but... - Let me tell you something, Nhung! - Get in the car. - Where the hell is she hiding? - Where is she? Where is she? We have to use coercive measures on this girl to dig into her pockets. Why did they know that I'm here? I'm listening. OK, I know it. What are they up to coming all the way up here? Urg, what's wrong with my stomach? Be strong, be strong, be strong. What's the matter? Hello sir, I live nearby. I'm having a problem with my stomach, can I use your bathroom? OK, go head, It's over there. You think you could challenge me, don't you? Hot water I'm so happy today, finally I can shower like everyone else. This is real hot water, finally this can be called taking a shower. One clean shower can last for three days. Sen, come here. Next time, Viet Anh gives out vegetables in the village, you'll come and help him. Yes Auntie! I'm very helpful. I can do anything. I'll do it. Auntie, I'm clever, agile and sociable. I can be helpful too. Let me do it. Nope, put it down, you are not meant to do it. Your job is over there. Scissors, rock, rock!!! Hey kids. Go downstairs to help her. Yes Madam. - Let's me help you. - Let's me help. Why are you so nice today? Ah, there are goose eggs. Hey, we're not done here. You are not helpful at all. Ahh! What an unlucky day! Anyway, I'm unlucky everyday. Let's take a shower first! Others can shower here, then you can. Shower here or leave this place, you choose! I choose to shower here. Good. If you want to be clean, then clean this bathroom up every morning, as well as the toilet. - Hello Auntie. - Hey Viet Anh. Where have you been this morning? I've been running some errands. Is everything OK? It's fine. Some people hired me to fix their houses. You look skinny lately. Take care of yourself. Thanks Auntie. Is she being punished, Auntie? Yes. Put the luffa in, then the seasonings, and finally stir fry them. Then done. Why didn't you let me close the windows? Sen, you freak me out! It's night time and you are combing your hair just like a ghost. I'm going out with Viet Anh tomorrow for business. Hey, how about you pretending to be sick so that you can help me with all the chores at home? (No, Miss)!- Here are the recipes I wrote down for you. I'll try to get home early tomorrow to help you. But I'm scared to be home alone. I'm sure that someone were snooping on me the other day. I'm 100% sure. I saw them here. One day I'll snoop to catch the one who snooped on me. She was awake a few minutes ago, and now she's snoring like a pig. Is this fish or charcoal? Nobody can eat this thing. Nobody can eat this? Can you? Nope, I'm on a diet. I can't believe that you can't even handle a small task like this. It's not just a small task. This could take me all year long. Then why can Sen do it but you can't? Don't compare me to her. Where are you taking it? To feed the pigs. They are hungry. People here are hungry, and yet you worry about the pigs. Take it back to the kitchen, cook it again and bring it here. The pigs are really hungry, Auntie. But we're hungry, too. From tomorrow, you are me. Play it well, then I'll pay you in three months, as well as give you a bunch of fancy clothes. Let's do it. Get down here. No explanation needed, get to work now. Missy! Missy, Missy! Stay still! Do not move! Do you believe that I'm gonna batter-fry you like a shrimp? I'm so tired of laughing, Missy. Please forgive me. You tore my skirt and now you're laughing like that? Missy, I'll never do it again. Missy, what are you doing? Do you know what brand it is? - Missy, please forgive me, Missy! - Forgive you? Do you know how much it costs? Stay still! Missy, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry Missy, I know it. I'll have to teach you how to do some chores. This is not alright, Missy, We'll be in troubles if Auntie Lai finds out. Okay? Yeah, you're right. I may have to learn some. Are you cooking for dinosaurs? Pigs cannot eat if you chop the veggies like that. Look at Sen! I'm just hoping you'll be able to graduate this course soon and leave this place. You're so misbehaved. Worm, worm, worm! Missy, why are you so rushed? You're so eager for that. Stop talking nonsense, Sen. Get back to work. I'm sorry, it's because of the worms. Because of the worm or because you like to hug me? Who would like to hug you? Look at your face! Bye! Hey sis, you really need to go to the toilet now, right? Come on, come with me to the neighbor's. I guarantee you that their bathroom is very nice. Yeah, he's right. It's very nice. Come with us. Follow us. Hurry up, sis. - Come on, hurry up. - They are about to close. Hurry UP! Hi Madam. Why are you sitting here? Aren't you cold? Why don't you tie your hair up? Don't let it cover all of your face like that. Sis, who are you talking to? I'm talking to the lady who's sitting right here. What lady? She told me that she didn't want to tie her hair up, she likes to do this. Ghost! Ghost! You kids wanted to fool me, huh? Tu, Tu! Tu! Tu, Tu! Tu, Tu! Wake up, Tu! Wake up, Tu! Tu, Tu! Tu, Tu, Tu! Doctor, is he alright? He was born with a heart disease. He's still in the emergency room. Please calm down everyone. Please go home. I want to know if he's fine. Does it matter to you whether he lives or dies? If you had worried about him, you would never have done that. Auntie, I don't know why you took her in. Look at her, since the moment she got here, all she's done is troublesome. Our lives are turned upside down because of her. If there's anything wrong with Tu, I'll never forgive you. You made it sound like I hurt him on purpose. If I had known about his heart disease, I would never have scared him like that. You guys are too loud. I'm here only because I met with misfortune. Do you think that I enjoy being here? I tried so hard to follow your instructions, but I simply couldn't do it. I can't do it. I didn't know that life in here was this difficult. You people don't know the life I had before I came here. Definitely not a ghost! Hey Missy, Why are YOU up so early? Have you been cooking this? Let me carry it for you. No, I'll do it myself. Tu! Lin! Ian, don't speak too loud, don't tease him, you have to be careful, remember? Tu, come upstairs, I'll feed you porridge. Sister, why are you so different today? Is it good? I cooked it. A bit gross but I like it. It feels like having parents who will take care of us when we're sick. I've never had that feeling before. Sister, I'll try to have a heart attack sometimes, then you will take care of me like this. Nonsense. Tomorrow, others and I will pray for you to get well soon. Okay? I'm sorry for my sin. I promise I won't ever hit my wife again. God, please forgive me. I'm sorry for my sin. Stop, Piggy- Where are you running to? Are you hiding here? I'll hit you to death if I can catch you. Oh God, my wife is here already. She wants to pay back. I have to run now. She'll beat me to death if she catches me. Where are you running to? Hey mister, come this way. Let me handle this. The pigs are out of case, (he") me! I'm so sorry. Get them! Vie!' Anh, tomorrow you'll make a new lock for the pigpen, okay? Yes Auntie. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do it. Look at you and your attitude. It's unimaginable. It's been several days and you haven't changed a bit. You're such a loser. Do you think that you're Lady Talented? Huh? I'm sorry that I disturbed you guys that much. An iced-tea, please. In a moment. You have Western wine here? Why didn't you tell me the other day? I don't know. That one is my son's. He left it there 10 years already. It's Western wine. Please give me one glass. I'm craving for it. Here's your drink. Good wine! Good wine! Good wine must come with good companion. Will you join me, Madam? I don't drink this. Go ahead! Cheers! Bottoms up! I never knew this drink is this good. I've got the best companion. We'll do this everyday, alright? Where is this? Who am I? Why are my luxurious things lying here? Oh gosh! Miu Miu, oh my Miu Miu. My Gosh! Why are you here? Are you hot, babe? Let me cover you, my Miu Miu. You're awake. I'm driving you to the bus station. Catch a bus yourself to get home. Which home? My house was seized. You messed everything up yesterday. You were constantly telling everybody that you didn't want to be there anymore. You said that you no longer needed the certificate for the course or the inheritance. That's why I'm driving you to the bus station. Can you please spare us the trouble? I didn't say that I no longer needed the inheritance? I really really need it. Please drive me back to Tu Tam, I promise to be good from now on. I'll be nice. I won't drink at all. I did nothing, why did you tie me up? Please forgive me. I don't believe you anymore. You drank up a bottle of pure infused wine like that. I'm so scared of you. Don't tell me that you don't remember anything. Missy, Missy! I didn't know. I saw a bottle of Western wine and drank it. Please give me another chance to say that I'm sorry to everyone. Just this one more time. Please give me another chance to say sorry to everyone. I'll do anything to redeem myself. Stop begging me. We have forgiven you so many times. One more time, just one more time. I have nowhere else to go. Please drive me back there. I have nothing to say to you. I've run out of ways to deal with you. Think for yourself. I think you should leave this place and stop bothering us. I gave her lots of advice, during the trip and she promised to change. From now on, teaching her will be my responsibility. I give you my word. It's up to you. Don't regret it. To be honest, Auntie Lai is very nice even though she seems so strict. I regret not learning everything before. L, I was mad at my Grandma, I thought that she sent me here because she didn't love me. I must have upset her a lot. Don't be so pessimistic. It's not too late to begin again. Actually, I found you so annoying at the beginning. I had never met anyone as clumsy and spoiled as you, let alone you messed up our lives around here. At the beginning, I just wanted you to finish the course and leave this place as soon as possible. Wow, you hated me that much? Not actually hated, I just found you so annoying. You see, life around here had been so peaceful. Peaceful and tranquil everyday, Since you came here, It's been nothing but noisy and messy. Everyday seem like the same. However, I'm getting used to it and you seem to have brought laughter to this place. My life before this had been very lively and animated. Though, I had never known how to take care of anyone. Tu was the first person on earth that I cooked for and took care of. I wish I had done this for my Grandma. Do it quickly, just like a professional chef. Oh gosh, it's too salty to eat. I'm so sorry, so sorry! Wait a second. My back hurts so much. I'm sorry Viet Anh. Hey! It's burning. The soup is burning. It's delicious. I'm sorry, did I hurt you? No, no. Are you alright, Missy? I'm sorry, Missy! Please forgive me. Stop! Stop, stop! Go on! Ah, the fish took the bait. Snake, snake! Viet Anh! Who is it? Stop now! Stop! Thief. Stop! There's a thief! Who are you? You cannot get away this time. It's you? Why are you snooping around me? Try to steal something? Or try to harm me? No, no, no. I just want to know how you're doing. Want to see how I am doing? I think you want to see how miserably I'm doing. Enjoy now? No, I'm telling you the truth. I'm afraid that if you can't finish the course you'll lose your inheritance. Why are you concerned about me losing the inheritance? Nhung! Your appearance here today has made me question my Grandma's will. Did you trick her into doing this? No, no. No, I did not. I'm telling you the truth. But, I'm so afraid now. I won't come back, I swear. - Sen! - Yes! Give me the equipment. Bigger. Don't do it Nhung. Nhung, give him a break. I think he's just curious about your current life. He did not hurt anyone. Yeah, she's right. I caught him, he's mine now. I can do whatever I want with him. You are a lawyer, aren't you? Yes, yes, I am. You know the law well, don't you? Yes, yes, I do. Do you want to be in jail? Yes, hey! No, I don't want to. Come on! Nhung, You can see how sorry he is. If I ever find you snooping around here again I won't let you get away with it this easily. You're not that kind! Come on, let's him go. He's too afraid to do it again. Nhung I'll let you go. - Stop joking like that! - I forbid you to laugh. Sit down. Snooping on girls who are sleeping at midnight, you're so sick. Ah! Oh gosh! Who was snooping on Sen? I'll spare you on one condition. You have to stay here one week to help me do the chores. I can't do that, please! Let me go home I have many things at home to do. Shut up! What the hell do you mean? My Grandma's gone and I am in here. You are very much free. Don't even think about lying to me. Do you really want to go home? Yes. Sen. - Yes, Missy. - Call the police. - Stop, please don't. - Give it to me, come on. Nhung, don't make a big deal out of this. You, you have to stay here for one week. Yes. Nhung, let him go! You'll enjoy this. Get up at TAM tomorrow! Breakfast? Yeah, breakfast. What on earth are you wearing? This is not a fashion runway. Remember! Inner beauty is so much more important than appearance. OK, I got it. But these are the only clothes I brought. 0h gosh! This is such a shame. Too shame. I'll get him some other outfits, or else Nhung won't let him alone. She seems to have memorized her lessons well, Auntie. I don't see any breakfast, it's just only peanuts and a shovel. Are you complaining? The vegetables are falling on the ground Pick them up quickly. Alright, alright. Bring them in here and wash them carefully. You're so clumsy. I don't know what you can do with your life. Bring the shovel here, hurry up! What? What is the shovel for? I've worked so hard this whole morning. To dig. To dig. Dig. To dig is okay. Here, Here is your shovel. Leave it there, I'll dig for you. Go inside and have some breakfast. Thank you, Missy. Wait? This seems a bit wrong. Do you want me to use the shovel on you? Are you crazy? I dig and you have breakfast? No, no. Let me do it. I'm the gentleman, I'll do it. You go inside and take a rest. Are you done cooking? I've been playing all day I'm so hungry now. It's done, it's done. Have it while it's still hot. No one can eat this. Why can't you handle such a small task? Who told you this is a small task? It could take me all year long. Why can I do it but you can't? Don't compare me to you! Hey! Where are you taking it? To feed the pigs. People here are hungry, and yet you worry about the pigs. Take it back to the kitchen and cook it again. Hurry UP! To be honest, I've never cooked before. Alright, wait for me then I'll cook it again. Stop! Bring it here. Oh gosh. It tastes salty. It's not salty, it's too salty. Go on! Life in here seems peaceful but in fact, it's more harsh than life out there. Yeah, it's too harsh. I'm counting on your advice. Uhm. It's good to be willing to learn. Ah, were you there with my Grandma in her last hours? Yes! I was the one who took her to the emergency room. Did she tell you anything about me? Yes. She knew that she wouldn't make it, she was sorry that she couldn't see you then in her last few hours. She asked me to help you stop being so spoiled. So she made this testament. However, she knew that for a lady like you, it's very difficult to change your lifestyle but that's the only way. Missy please be understanding. Don't be mad at her. I'm not mad at her. I know how bad my lifestyle was, that's why she led me here. You know how much she has loved me since I was a kid, she was never harsh on me. She gave me whatever I wanted. You can't imagine how miserable I was when I first got here. I couldn't understand why people here were able to live like this. But little by little, I got used to the lifestyle here. You see now I'm able to cook, plant vegetables, feed the pigs, and also take care of the kids here. If I cannot do simple tasks like these, how could Grandma leave me her inheritance, right? - Right! - Right my eye! You! You are the one who's always backbiting. Come eat those, hurry up! Hi everybody. Good morning sir and madam. Feel free to choose and pick them. It's quite heavy. It's so picturesque. If you stay here longer, I'll take you to more beautiful places. Eh, don't jinx it. I have no intention of staying here any longer. I mean after I get my certificate, I'll come back here and visit everyone. Will you? Yes, I will. Or you can visit me in the city, I'll take you to places. Especially, places with very good wine. Wine? I thought you gave up drinking? Who would take you home if you were drunk again? Don't worry! I have a group of friends, they always follow me, they'll take me home. I forgot that you have a lot of friends. Can you show me how to row? This is for you. Cool! Maybe, this is the most beautiful light I've ever seen. When I was a kid, whenever I got scolded by Auntie Lai, I used to hide in the bell tower. Auntie Lai scolded you? I also got beaten. But she loves me very much. She has taken care of me since I was born. To me, she's like a mother. They told me that the day I was left here was the day Auntie Lai moved in. I was not abandoned but my parents died when I was so young. I have no memory of them at all. At least you're lucky, you have no hatred for those who gave birth to you. It's so tiring to bear hatred. We were all born without hatred. This is all people's fault. Who doesn't want a family? But isn't your family here now? PLEASE GIVE ME HIGH MARK! YOU LOOK SO PRETTY TODAY. How can you call this bathing? You have to bathe them one by one. Hold it in your arms. What? Hold them? Bathe them one by one? They are stinky. I'll gather them up and shower them at the same time. They'll be clean. Alright, I'll do it later. You can go home now, to prepare the documents for my inheritance tomorrow. What? I can go home now? Give my bike back! Wait for me. I'll go and see what's happening. Give my bike back! Give it back! Hey! Hello to the Lady who raises pigs. What are you doing here? How come you know this place? I'm just paying you a visit. You kids go over there and play. He's my friend, don't worry. Get down here. Have you been smoking something? How dare you come here being high like that? Let me be. Did you plant these? Hey, this is not the right place for you to make trouble. Wake up! You're getting your inheritance tomorrow, aren't you? Hey. How did you know this? It doesn't concern you. Stop messing around, or else I'll yell and everybody will come out. Yell? Make it loud. Make it loud. Call everybody here. I have gifts for them. Let's see. Tomorrow when you get the inheritance, will the shareholders of your Grandma's company let a spoiled brat like you run the company? What have I done to you? Why are you doing this to me? It's simply because you're too rich, and I'm too poor, that's enough reason for me to hate you. Oh, I forgot. I hate anyone who's richer than me. I hate them all. Crazy, you're really crazy, I've never treated you badly. I gave you everything you needed. Yes. It's never enough for me. I want more. If you want more, earn it yourself. Don't you feel ashamed when you spend my money? What about you? You did not earn anything, yet you still have money to spend. Just because your family's so rich. If you are so rich, give some to the charity. Get out of here. Immediately. Ah, tomorrow you will be back to being the Lady? For me, I'll have nothing but these photos. Plus some fun video clips when you were drunk. What do you want? I've been waiting for this question, why didn't you ask earlier? We wouldn't have wasted so much time. I want a half of your inheritance. Have you lost your mind? You have no right to ask for that. I'm not bluffing. Get online and see the video clips for yourself. Hey. What are you doing to my boss? Wow, how loyal! Aren't you the one who made her do forced labor here for 3 months? I'm just acting on her Grandma's will. What do you want? Inherence? Are you okay? Go to hell, go to hell, you son of a bitch. I'm sorry, I wasn't calling you "son of a bitch", I was calling you an asshole. I'm sorry! Stop it. Auntie, come with us. He also destroyed the vegetable garden, Auntie. Go to your rooms. I'm asking you one last time. Will you do it? No, never. I won't give you anything, not even a dime. Who are you? Ask her. I don't care who you are. I won't allow you to be here and ruin this place. Coward. Are you alright? Hey rustic boy, you'd like to rescue the Beauty, right? Don't you have any idea about her past? Such a party girl. No one can save her now. I don't care about her past. But I forbid you to hurt Nhung. Look at this. You know nothing, stupid orphan. Who are you calling orphan? Orphan? Orphan? Viet Anh, Viet Anh, stop it! - Please stop. - Let me go. Viet Anh, stop it. Viet An h! Let me call the police. Bring him away. Missy, he has no video clip in his phone, he was just bluffing. I WANT TO GIVE YOU THIS BEFORE LEAVING, CAN WE MEET AT THE CLASS ROOM? My Lord. I confess everyday but I have never forgotten my sins. It was my fault in the past that today made Viet Anh humiliated, and I have seen him turning from an obedient young boy into a fierce guy with my bare eyes. Rm praying to you, my Lord, please forgive and bless my son. My Lord. Please protect this place, bring the peace back just as before. How could you be so cruel? Do you know how much Viet Anh desires to have a family? Nhung, how did you get in here? Are you snooping on me? Don't ask me, answer my question. No, you don't understand. - You have no idea. - No, I do understand. Even when Grandma always loved me whole-heartedly, but I've always wanted to call someone "Mommy". I know Viet Anh has always wanted the same thing, I'll tell him about this. Nhung, please don't tell him, I'm begging you, please don't go. Why? Why are you so selfish? Why don't you dare to admit the child you gave birth to, he's your flesh and blood. Society in the past was not that simple, my girl. The day I carried Viet Anh was the day I knew his father were married to someone else. Being afraid of the neighbors' rumors, I left my mother land then brought Viet Anh here. And I also stayed. So why didn't you let him know you're his mother? At least he would have grown up knowing that he's still got a mother. But I've still been by his side for the past 30 years. You know what? There were many times I really wanted to call him my son but I never dared to. You're not in my shoes, you don't understand. It's true that I have no idea what you're thinking. But I know for sure that everyone wants a family when they're alive. And so does Viet Anh. He deserves to know this. Nhung, stop right there. If you don't do what I said, I won't sign the will of your grandma. So, I have no reason to stay here and listen to your sermon anymore. Nhung, Nhung. You! YOU! Viet Anh. Viet Anh, Viet Anh! Viet Anh. Mrs. Lai Viet Anh! Viet Anh! Viet Anh Viet Anh, Viet Anh! Viet Anh. Viet Anh! Viet Anh, please stop! Viet Anh Hey Viet Anh, Viet Anh, Viet Anh Auntie Lai Aunti Lai! Aunti Lai. Auntie Lai, Auntie Lai, Auntie Lai Auntie Lai, Auntie Lai. Get her to the hospital, quickly! Auntie Lai The patient's relatives are not allowed to come in, please go to the counter for the check-in procedure. You go for the check-in, give me the key. Don't you dare to get away! The subscriber you've dialed is temporarily not available. Viet Anh. Hurry up Viet Anh, Auntie Lai is now in the emergency. - What did you just say? - Hurry up! Who's patient Lai's relatives? It's me. She's suffering from multiple traumatic injuries and losing lots of blood, does anyone have type-O blood? I have type-O blood. She will come round, don't worry. Why are you still here? You're late for the inheritance. Never mind. "Om;" what are feeling right now, mom? Are you hurt anywhere? You made me worried sick. I'm I'm so sorry, my son. You should not say anything, what's most important is you recover shortly and then we'll be living together. I'm listening. I know, I'll be there soon. Take care of yourself, I have to go now. I'll go back to visit you soon. Thanks! Could I have a word with you? I was about to give you this thing last night, but I didn't expect things to turn out like this. Keep it as a reminder of me. You try your best to take care of Auntie Lai. I will go back to visit everyone soon. I have to go now. Missy, you're late for the inheritance, please go home and pack your belongings so that they can run the auction for charity. You're home, come here with me. You're still alive, aren't you? Yeah, I'm still alive to watch you growing up, getting married and having babies. Only then can I rest in peace. I'm here, baby! It's you, the real you. Have you been testing me, Grandma? Do you know how miserable I have been Grandma? I know that, I'm always by your side everyday. You know, since I was so worried that you would struggle with eating and sleeping at the new place I've been watching you every night. I had to have him act like a lawyer because I was afraid you would doubt that. Since you went away, I missed you so much. I've been so worried about you I miss you. That I couldn't go to sleep. But for your future I had to do that, do you understand? I got it, it's my fault, it's all my fault, I'm so sorry Grandma. Don't cry, my baby girl. So, I still stand a chance to be by your side, is that right Grandma? But I came across some strange things Grandma, why did I constantly have a dream about a baby girl wandering around in Tu Tam? It's probably because you used to live there since you were a child. Then when you came back, your memory flashbacked to the time you spent there. Me? What do you mean I used to live there, Grandma? I don't understand what you're talking about. When you were just born, your parents passed away in an accident, then you were brought to Tu Tam, and nurtured by Auntie Lai. I didn't have any children then, so I adopted you when you were 4 years old. This is your birth certificate with your birth parents' names on it. You've been hiding it from me for my whole life. But now, it doesn't matter whose daughter I am, the most important thing to me is that you stay alive here with me. Yes, I am here now, my baby girl. Ah, sis Nhung. Sis Nhung. Sis Nhung, sis Nhung. - Good morning, Auntie Lai. - Good morning. - Good morning, Madam. - Good morning, children. Today my Grandma and I come here to visit everyone, I'll spend a part of my inheritance on renovation for this place. I hope that you will accept my offer. Anyway this is also my home. Thank you so much. Please come in and have a drink. Sis Nhung, sis Nhung. For those who want to talk in private, please go ahead. C'mon, let's go my children. You must be very happy at home. I'm so surprised that your Grandma is still alive. Giving some thought to it, it must have been hard for you to stay here for months. I did feel terrible at first, but anyway, I'm glad to have lots of memories here. I feel like this place is truly my motherland. Because you were here when you were a child. Yep, even Sen wants to stay here and at the moment. I no longer need anyone to assist me. I want to spend more time with my Grandma and take good care of her. For me, spending as much time as possible to take care of my mom is what I've always wished for. Nhung! It's time to go. Take care Missy, come here to visit me whenever you can. I'll miss you a lot. Remember to do the laundry, cooking and take good care of the kids, don't ever be lazy. We should leave now and let everyone rest. Goodbye Madam. - Goodbye Madam, bye bye. - I'm leaving now, goodbye. I'll come back to visit you and everyone. You'd better hurry up to chase her or else you'll miss them.
