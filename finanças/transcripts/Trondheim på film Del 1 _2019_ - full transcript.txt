In 1907, the British film photographer Harold Lomas came to Trondheim. The visit left traces, for when Lomas filmed Trondheim - - he used the city's new, electrified pride - the tram. He mounted a camera on the front of it, - - and the footage from when the tram was driving through the city - - exists today in the oldest film program from Trondheim. At the beginning of the 20th century - film production for cinema audience was in the starting pit. The medium had strong appeal. The interest in live pictures were so great - - that more private cinemas - - competed for the audience in Trondheim after the turn of the century. People could go to the cinemas and see themselves, - like all of us at all times have enjoyed see ourselves in the mirror. The cinemas also showed movies from distant corners of the world, - - and people of Trondheim could be fascinated by picture stories - - from America and India. The film from Trondheim was sent out into the world - as movies from around the world came to us, - - and it is documented that Lomas' "Tram Ride Round Trondhjem" - - was shown as far away as Singapore. From 1940 to 1956, Lyder Selvig was the director at Trondheim Kino. Selvig had a background as a filmmaker - - and had directed the success "Norge, vårt Norge, i toner og billeder" in 1929. During Selvig's work in Trondheim, the cinema was not just a place to watch movies. The cinema, which was run of the municipality from 1918, - - was also a production company as under Selvig's leadership - - made films about Trondheim and news reports for Filmavisen. Trondhjemmere flocked to the cinemas to watch movies about themselves - - and about how life unfolded in the city. It would still take a few years before the TV was introduced in Norway, - - so the cinema was important to people. It was a social responsibility for Trondheim Cinema to produce film. There is nobody critical glances in Selvig's films. They establish picturesque notions of the good life, - - and then they were also created at a time when a lot of children were born - - and the belief in the future was strong. Trondheim is one of the oldest cities in the country. Founded in the year 995 by Olav Tryggvason, - - who today looks down on the city from his pedestal on Trondheim's square. With its central location, the city is an important traffic center - - with good connections over land, by sea and in the air. Here we see the plane make a stopover on the way to the midnight sun's wonderland. The central building that connects old culture to today's business, - - is Nidaros Cathedral, which has always characterized the cityscape. Our national shrine is a memory of Olav Haraldssønn, whose death at Stiklestad - - marks the victory of Christianity in Norway. For 500 years, crowds of pilgrims flocked to St. Olav's shrine and well. And Nidaros Cathedral became one of the Nordic countries' largest and most beautiful cathedrals. Just south of the dome is the Archbishop's Palace, Norway's oldest secular stone building. Other older church buildings are Our Lady's Church, with the year 1739 on the tower wing, - - and the small beautiful stone church on Lade, erected on the site which even before the year 1000 - - was the seat of kings and chieftens. Also a number of newer churches. Kristiansten fortress is today not as dangerous as this seems. Now the venerable cannons are used only for saluting. But in the old days, the fortress was of the greatest defense significance for Trondheim. The idyllic Munkholmen has through the ages served - - as a monastery, fortress and prison. Today it is a favorite swimming area and tourist attraction. Of the city's newer institutions The Norwegian University of Technology is the most important. It is the country's only technical university. The matriculation takes place in solemn forms. The stronghold of student life is Samfundet, and when the NTH guys have their UKA - - they create a carnival atmosphere in the city, with their festive spectacles. Norwegian Teacher Training College temporarily resides at Lade Gård - - which is about 150 years old. The Cathedral School is the country's oldest high school - - and counts Håkon Håkonssøn and Tordenskiold among its students. The first day of school is an event. The school for the deaf. And the school for the blind. Out on Øya is the Red Cross clinic, and nearby the Central Hospital, - - where a mighty hospital complex is erected. The beautiful E.C. Dahl Foundation. Seamen's retirement home and other institutions - - shows that the city takes care of its old ones. But it's not just the old people who are diligent when it comes to needlework. Handicrafts and home industry are common in Trondheim and Trøndelag. The goods are popular on the st. Hans market. Trondheim has wide main streets. The current zoning plan was carried out by General Cicignon - - after the fire disaster in 1681. Let's take a car ride through the central part of the city. From the square we turn into Munkegaten and stops at Stiftsgården - - which is the royal residence. It is the largest in the Nordic region and perhaps the most beautiful wooden building. Most people who have been to Trondheim, will recognize the city center - - with Olav Tryggvason's street, Søndre, Nordre and Kongens street - - with modern buildings in contrast to the old wooden buildings. Bakklandet was in the old days a suburb of Trondheim. As a contrast to the wide main streets - - Cicignon's city plan retained part of the medieval roads - - which creates an interesting element in the modern cityscape. In the narrowest of the passages, Skradikveita, which is now disappearing, - - there was only room for pedestrian traffic. In the old buildings in Kongens street we find special mirrors - - which was once so modern. The trip goes through Mellomila to Ilsvikøra, where the city fishermen was located - - busy mending nets and baiting hooks for tomorrow's catch. And the next day, the women can get wonderful, live fish in Ravnkloa. Trondheim gets part of its electric power from Leirfossene - - a few kilometers south of the city. Let us follow the Nidelven towards the fjord. There is a lot of salmon here - - and below the waterfalls, even in the city, duels are played - - between the big salmon and the angler. The boat trip reveals idyllic surroundings on both sides of the river. We cross the new Elgeseter bridge. And, as a contrast, Gamle Bybro with its distinctive portals. Along the riverbanks lies the old merchants' piers, - - where all economic power in Trondheim was gathered in the 1700s. Let's look at how people live in Trondheim. In recent years it is the modern apartment blocks - - which characterizes housing construction in the city itself. But a large part of the population which has its work in the center, - - lives in the residential areas on the hills which surrounds the city. At the port, which has undergone a great deal of development, - - it is busy business. When spring comes, the city population travel out to their summer resorts. Some lives in the well-kept cabins of the allotment gardens. Others have their summer homes by the fjord or in forests and fields. It's hard to find a city with such lovely terrain just outside the front door. On the one hand, we have the areas by Jonsvannet. And even closer lies Bymarka with Gråkallen and Storheia, - - and with Skistua as the central midpoint. Sports are popular among youths. And the audience joins in on the sporting competitions. Trondheim has a bustling bathing life. Some choose the lakes in Bymarka. But most people prefer salty sea, - - and then there are plenty of bathing places to choose from along the fjord. After a sunny summer day by the fjord or in forests and fields - - is it nice to end the day with a little party - - at one of the city's restaurants. But on a night like this, one stays out - - under the scent of hedges, June sky and St. Hans bonfire. In the early 60's we had not yet found oil in Norway, - - but optimism still characterized us. We had won the war, we loved John Wayne and Julie Ege. It would be typically Norwegian to . . a be good, we were convinced of that. We should plan for good lives. It was just a matter of making the right moves. The future would give profitable industrial development - - driven by wise heads from the Norwegian University of Technology. Confidence in municipal and national authorities were strong. It was in the bureaucracy the big thoughts were thought. In Trondheim in 1962 a master plan was forming - - where the framework for urban development for the next decades were established. It was time for Trondheim municipality to get a film about itself. Finally, I approached the goal. I came as a refugee from South Africa - - with a Norwegian scholarship in my pocket. Now I was going to study "area planning" - - up here under the North Pole. The books I had obtained, told interesting things, - - but no one was about what I was most interested in. The city itself, on the other hand, it looked nice! It could not have been more beautiful. We are now landing at Trondheim. Fasten your seat belts and no smoking please! Stewardess had to be some sort of "missionary". She talked and talked, but not about anything but a cathedral. I had to see it, she said. I was obviously looking for the technical "high school", - - and finally I got a glimpse of it too. The only one I knew up here, was Asbjørn Austvik. He was an area planner. Immediately he began to explain that Trondheim was a coastal city, - - and that the hinterland consisted of agricultural and forestry areas. That it was a rich hinterland, I understood of the large farms. In the middle of the square stood a huge pillar, - - and on top of it a little man. His name was Olav Tryggvason, and he had founded the city approx. 1000 years ago. Many of the natives believe Trondheim should still be Norway's capital, - - because from ancient times the city has been the natural center - - geographically, - - political - - and spiritual. In the square it was flourishing. But I found very little of what I was used to from home. But they had a lot of other things. Even slippers and paintings! Everything seemed strange, but I was greeted with kindness, - - and I was genuinely happy about that. The babies were almost as cute as at home. But they wrapped them up, and that in the middle of summer! The first days I spent to look around - - and get to know the landscape. The cathedral was magnificent! I had no problem understanding that people from all over Europe - - had made the pilgrimage to this shrine. Yes, here you could be humbled. Austvik could not praise Cicignon enough, - - who had planned the reconstruction after the fire in 1681. As a city planner, Cicignon had to have been far ahead of his time. That he had not anticipated that today we drove around in cars, - - we could not blame him. I would not mind to live under one of these roofs. Strange, all the houses were built of wood! I could not understand that merchants, shopkeepers and craftsmen - - could afford to use such an expensive building material. The really rich lived even nicer. Stiftsgården was surely one of the largest wooden buildings in the world! This is where the king lives when he visits Trondheim. Others were foundations, bequeathed by rich people in the old days - - to fatherless, widows and the elderly. Back home the tribe always took care of people - - who could not support themselves. The people had become early rich up here, I thought. "Oh no.", in Austvik. It was only then that the trade with The uplands and the seas picked up, - - and we in the 18th century took to exporting cups - - lumber and fish, that we can talk about prosperity. Both men and women became fashion conscious - - and followed closely in the fashions of the world. The water supply was improved, - - and the vehicles were of this year's model. Along the river it was hectic activity. To this day the piers stands as a memory - - from the lush period in the history of the city. Some are torn, but it's fun to watch - - that the inhabitants keeps to the old style. From this environment an old inn has been preserved. Here it is served raw, dried, smoked meat, - - just like at home. Suddenly a lady approached us! She was a teacher. Wouldn't I be so kind to visit the school where she worked and give a lecture - - about the conditions in my own country? Yes, why not! Well, I promised to come. Every day I walked around. And what building activity! I could not understand - - that ordinary workers and white-collar workers would live here. Here it is the municipality and the housing corporation that is behind it. I had to find out more about that collaboration! In many places new industries were established. Here they built an electronic equipment factory. It would eventually become one of the big companies in the city. I did not mind settling down here permanently. But could I? Then I would betray people at home. Wasn't that my job - - to study with a view to make developments in my own country? I also studied port facilities. Nearly 50 million NOK they had spent building after the war. How they in this barren country managed to raise the money - - I do not understand! Once they had to have started like us, on bare ground. It could not have been so long ago. The industry was new. To begin with, business was based on trade in natural products - - which they eventually began to refine. This tremendous development in all areas! The most interesting company produced electronic equipment. Here they must have invested a lot in education. Because here the ideas and the good solutions were the things that counted. I got to see the company who made the fine cured meats. After watching the temptations I understood - - that too many calories can also create problems. Fortunately, I was able to get rid of some of it by swimming in the pool. To my surprise there was salt water in the pool! What was that guy? Tordenskiold. A "sea hero" from the time when Trondheim was into shipping. Strange. If I asked about shipping today, - - they started talking about something else! About Hjallis, Martin Stokken, and the Cathedral, of course. But quietly they built ships and opted for shipping nonetheless. And they used a lot of money to build a center - - for the education of seafarers. The command bridge was a technical marvel. It turned in all directions as where the students turned the steering wheel. My countrymen would probably ask - - how many illiterates they have in Trondheim, - - when it was still necessary to build all kinds of schools. The most impressive facility was the technical university. The hydropower lab impressed me the most. Here they studied everything that had to do with hydropower. Because it impacted directly on the standard of living. Was it not due to the fact that one no longer based everything on muscle power but rather let the forces of nature do the hard work that one lived so well? Finally I got time to give the lecture - - I had promised to give the students at Ringve school. They seemed very interested in every word I said. They thought anything that had to do with Africa was mysterious and exciting. A pure adventure! If they only knew! But that also my continent, with its 250 million people, - - can become an adventurous continent, of that I had no doubt. If only we got schools, teachers, doctors - - and above all engineers and technicians - - who could teach us to utilize our resources. Not to mention the power sources. That would be a long way to go. Will I experience it? That afternoon I was going with Austvik to a football match. What did I have to do in football? After seeing the pictures from home - - I most wanted to to opt out of the world. "Are you crazy?", said Austvik. "When you first start you learn for free "- - "by all the mistakes we have made." "I'm telling you you will save time! " And here at Lerkendal we've played for 13 minutes - of the quarter-final match between Brann and Rosenborg It's excellent conditions here today, - - nice autumn weather and approx. 20,000 spectators. Rosenborg has been the fastest. Fast offense game has so far kept Brann busy. The people of Bergen have great respect for John Krogh, so they forget - - Birger Tingstad, and the audience will not tell. At least Mayor Gjærevoll, of course. Oh, wow! Situations in front of the goal. Very dangerous after a free kick. Outer left, intercepts the ball and puts in front of goal. No, it's taken by Rosenborg's right half, - - which leads across the course. Gorgeous. No more dribbling now! Over to Birger Tingstad. then to John Krogh, who passes both back players! And scores! Oh, oh, oh! No doubt that the mayor behaves differently than in the city council. You have been presented with a case - - that applies the future big Trondheim. The question of a sensible and rational utilization - - in the next decades - of the areas which is at our disposal. What we are all concerned about, - - is this the growth and future of the urban community. We know it will grow, - - and what can we do to ensure growth to be healthy - - and the development good? We have received a forecast - which shows that the population in 1980 will probably be increased by 25,000. When we today will discuss the future of the city, - - it is these new inhabitants we should keep in mind. We know the increase in the population will create new needs. 7000-8000 new jobs must be obtained. Apartments 25,000 new inhabitants must be built. . Electric power and water must be provided for the industry and the new homes. We need to expand the road network so that covers the need for traffic in the age of the car. Schools of all kinds must be built for children and young people. All this requires a lot of space. At the same time, we must preserve the agricultural areas - - and secure large open spaces. The main idea behind the report presented - - as an utilization plan for the Trondheim area, - is in short this: We must make sure that big Trondheim will be a beautiful city, - a city with a good and versatile environment, - - a city where people thrive. Mr Mayor. It seems to be a thorough work behind the proposal, - - and I want to compliment committee for its work. The plan raises an important question: How should we develop - - the communications within this area? Yes, a myriad of questions were put forward. One of the most important was how one should provide more electric power. Today, big Trondheim uses 650 million kWh per year. But by 1980 one had to have twice as much. To cope with this they had to expand the entire Nea watercourse. Important stages were already completed. This had to give the city opportunities for a vast industrial expansion! I, who was used to treating water as luxury, understood nothing. Did they understand what water really was? And now they wanted more! The industry demanded it, Austvik said. They planned to not only to use the whole of Jonsvatnet - - for drinking water source, but also Selbusjøen. Between the lakes they were going to create a long tunnel. Total cost wound not be more than 30-40 million kroner. But in return, this facility would in the future - - secure the power supply. land for housing and industry was a bigger problem. One would be reluctant to use farm land. Large areas were considered sacred - - and protected for food production. And then one was concerned for Trondheim as a university city. In not many years it would be a university center - in the Moholt area . But this area here, the old airport at Lade, - - it was not suited for modern air traffic That is why they chose to let the industry expand here. An autumn day Austvik took me out to a big swamp area. Heimdalsmyra. Here one hoped with time to build a modern airport. I do not envy the people who had to regulate all this. Those who would say: Here we will have housing. Here there must be outdoor areas. Here we will have playing grounds and here we shall have industry It was strange how much everyone agreed to dispose of the areas in this way - that future generations were also satisfied. I was impressed by the colorful maps. Eventually it dawned on me me that the green fields - - was set aside for agriculture. The brown areas were areas where there were now homes. The reds were planned residential areas. The light blues were areas where it was industry. The dark blues were set aside for new industry. The violets were for all kinds of schools. The yellow ones showed parks and green areas. There was no shortage of plans. Many were upset that the actors - - had such bad working conditions in the old theater. Yes, the city needed a new theater and a new town hall. The town hall and the theater should lie in the middle of the city. . In a whole it was a great width in the cultural life of the city. Out on Ringve, a farm where great chieftens had lived, - - it was a protected place - with a unique collection of musical instruments from around the world. The barn was the funniest concert hall I've seen. People came from everywhere to study the collections - - or attend the intimate concerts - - or the musical tableaux. The music activity was inspiring. Wherever I went I heard musicians rehearsing. Everyone prepared the great interplay of the orchestra. That I should ever get skis on my feet, I had never thought. But I had to! Because in Trondheim the mothers brought even young babies out in the ski terrain. While I admired the children and young people, - - it struck me that it was for these all the drawings, - - the models and future plans were made. So that their living conditions can get even better! For me, Trondheim was an adventure! Here the elected representatives used imagination, time and abilities - - to plan for the generations that come after them. What was the most important thing I learned during my studies in Trondheim? You do not jump into the future without being prepared! Without good planning. And that wasn't that the secret to the tremendous growth up here in the north? Willingness to look ahead, look into the future - - even though much was still in the dark.
