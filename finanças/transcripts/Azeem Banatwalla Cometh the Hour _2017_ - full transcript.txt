See I don't understand this. Why do all comics want to put this pre-film in their stand-up special? Just start the show! Nobody wants to listen to you sitting and doing bak bak all the time! I'll tell you what the problem is... All these comics, they're narcissistic people. They just want attention on them all the time. Hello, excuse me. Please focus, focus. But I am not that guy! I don't want to waste your time, so I am going to start this show right now. Hello! So! What's happening, Mumbai? How are you guys doing? Are you guys feeling okay? Happy to be in Mumbai? Not particularly, traffic, okay... But I've been travelling quite a lot in the course of this tour. I've been to many countries. I went to Singapore recently, Malaysia, went to Thailand... He's crossing his legs already. Wow! But Thailand, is just packaged as this vortex of sexual energy, right? Everyone in Thailand is having sex. You open the cupboard in your hotel room, there's two people having sex. “Why you disturb us, go away!” It's great fun but Indian men specifically get very excited about Thailand. Any time as an Indian man, you tell your friends, you're going to Thailand. They get very excited. They're like, "Bro! Brooo! Broooooo! Bangkok bro! Hot chicks bro, hot chicks." I went to Thailand and I found out this is a lie. Listen, half of them are not hot and the other half aren't chicks. So fuck off! It's terrible. But I do enjoy travelling, I love travelling abroad by air. It's a very luxurious experience. Even in our airports we have these technological imports from the west. These things called travelators. You guys know what travelators are? Human conveyor belts. What purpose do they serve? You get on a travelator, walk ten percent faster than the guy who is not on the travelator. “Screw you, walking slowly bastard. Haha.” Fat people get on and they're like, "Aha, this is what jogging feels like!" It's nice. And when you think about it, travelators, what are they? They are escalators with no ambition. You can imagine the travelator's father saying, “Look at Mr. Sharma's escalator. See the heights he has scaled! Works in a mall now." I've realised, Indian men have no respect for air hostesses. I've realised this. I was on a flight recently and there was this uncle sitting next to me. He calls the air hostess. She's like, "Yes sir, what can I get you?" "Food! Get food!" "Sir, veg, non-veg, what do you want?" "Both! Get both!" He called her again, "Yes sir, what can I get you?" He's like, "Booze, get booze!" "Sir, wine, whiskey?" "Both! Get both!" I was like what is this behaviour? I thought the next time he'll call, he'll just say, "Dance now, dance! Dance bitch!" Even then she'll be like, "Yes sir, Salsa or Mujra? What would you prefer, sir?" "Both, get both!" But every time you are travelling by air in this country, you will always find this one bunch of Indian idiots. Who are travelling by air for the first time. And you can tell that this is the case, because they take photographs of everything. "Hey suitcase, suitcase. Take a photo!" While going through security, "Hey, frisking frisking." They see an air hostess, "Hey item, item. Take a photo!" The air hostess is like, "Sir, please let go of my boob." "No, both, get both!" But if there is one thing that unites us as a species... it is the fact that we hate babies on planes. I think we can all agree on this? I was on a flight, few months ago. Five babies on a same flight. One here, one here, one here. It's like this 5.1 Dolbaby digital surround sound. That does not deserve that. And after a point, even the parents stop giving a shit. They're like, "You cry asshole. I'm done with this, fuck it. Airhostess, both. Take both!" Take it and go. But it was on this five baby flight, where I had this epiphany. Where I realised that the only reason why airplane windows are sealed shut... is that you can't take the baby and just throw it the fuck out of the plane! Would be amazing, can you imagine that. "Waaah! Poof!" Bye! If you are flying over Africa, there'll be African tribals down there going... "Simba? What the fuck? We have no money to feed you. We'll have to put you up for adoption." Then Angelina Jolie walks in. "Did you say adoption? Give!" It's fun. I end up travelling quite a lot in this profession. I stay in different varieties of hotel rooms. I have a bit of a problem with five-star hotel rooms though. Two problems. Number one, I cannot afford them. And you'd think right? You pay ten thousand rupees for a five-star hotel room, you would think everything is taken care of within that. It's not! Everything in that room is chargeable. You touch one packet of peanuts, a guy appears out of the ground, "Yes sir. Two thousand rupees!" Everything's chargeable except for that one bottle of mineral water. And even about that, the hotels, they are assholes. They put a tag on the bottle. Which says, "With our compliments.” “We got this bro, we got this. Ten grand for the room, ten bucks for the bottle. You chill, we got this." And what does with our compliments even mean? What? You open the bottle and a guy comes, "Yes, sir. You've lost weight. Your skin is glowing, sir. Would you like more compliments?" But it makes sense to tell us that the bottle of water is free because listen, we are Indians. Unless you explicitly tell us that something in a five-star is free, we will not touch it. If there was an Indian version of that movie, 127 Hours, it would be a story of a Sindhi man who got locked in his hotel room... almost died of dehydration. Because he was like, "I'm not paying tax on this water. Fuck it. I am drinking my own urine now." The guy from the hotel comes, "No sir, drink our urine with our compliments." Second problem I have with five-star hotels. You go to a five-star hotel in India, which has Indian people using it. Go into the bathroom, sit on the toilet seat. You get done with your business. Your hand reaches to your right. And nothing. No jet spray, fucking toilet paper. And you sit in that seat in that moment feeling so betrayed. Thinking, “You bastards... The ONE place, where you should've put water with your compliments!” It's terrible. But no, it's good to see you guys out here. It's good to see you guys laughing. There is a great statistic about laughing which says that, every time you laugh, it extends your life by two minutes. What a load of bullshit! Try telling that to Sidhu, when he is about to die, really! But we like to do this. We like to take facts and back them up with statistics. People say “Don't smoke man. Every time you smoke, it reduces your life by five minutes” And I'm like, "Cool. But how do you check?" Like is there some HR department in heaven that has a guy with a calculator, who's going, "Minus five. Minus five. What are you doing with your life?" And if laughing does extend your life by two minutes, it does makes Yamraj, the Grim Reaper's job very difficult. He goes to an old man who is about to die like, "Come bloody old man, time's up. Let's go." Not very polite these days. At that exact moment, the old man is like... "Yea okay, we'll wait for two minutes." "Four minutes." "Bro, just have a cigarette man. We've got a schedule to keep!" I love being in Bombay. Bongay, apparently. Bongay! But I love being in this city. I've lived here all my life. I bought a car recently. And I've realised Bombay is one of the most unique cities in the world to drive in. Because it is the only city in the world where along with memorising directions, you also have to memorise potholes. Like you need to know. There is so much chaos! There's a pothole here, three beggars there. You need to know... It happens. And if somehow the BMC fills up a pothole, you get confused. Am I going the right way? I don't know where I live anymore! And I don't know if this happens to you guys but whenever I'm driving and I see a police car on the road, I start to feel guilty. For no reason. Like they are going to arrest me for having a face. I don't know why. And it's not just me, you'll always see this on a highway, expressway, Bombay-Pune. You will always see this police car in the middle of the road and there is a train of ten cars driving just behind the police car. Because they are too afraid to overtake. Why? These are Maharashtrian cops. Have you ever seen a Maharashtrian cop engaging in a high speed police chase? Has this ever happened? Some Ferrari goes zooming by and he's like, "Oh my God. Inspector Gawande! Don't know why I am holding your balls and saying this. But Inspector Gawande! Engage the afterburners!" "Sir, this is a Bolero. We don't have an afterburner. We have an agarbatti if you would like. And this bottle of water with our compliments." Police do weird stuff on the roads man. We already have enough traffic, but Mumbai police feels that, "No, we must create more. And what they do is, they have these check posts in the middle of the day. Middle of the day, check post. And apparently, it is to catch terrorists. What do they do to catch terrorists, let me explain. One barricade here, one barricade here. One car driving through, one policeman standing watching. Who are these terrorists? Who sit at the window seat of the car, holding up their bomb, "Yes sir. We have the bomb. We were not expecting this cunning trap. Shit. Abdul, next time put it in the dicky!" Doesn't work. I get very angry when I drive. Very angry and a huge part of my angst is because of this one species on Indian roads called bikers. Bikers are the most optimistic people on Indian roads. Because for a biker in traffic, this is the situation. This is the bike. This is the gap. Bike will never fit in the gap. But let's try anyway! I do not know what they are doing. I think they are operating at a higher philosophical level. Because in their heads I think they're not navigating traffic. They are testing the theory of relativity. If I enter this vacuum with the correct velocity, it'll create a wormhole that exits at the end of the traffic jam. It's not Interstellar, it's InterPulsar, what's up! It's terrible, dude. The worst types of bikers are these bikers who ride in the middle of road in pairs of two. And they are chilling having a conversation. Living life. Fifty cars stuck behind, zero fucks given. And I do not understand what they are trying to do. What is this situation? It's two wheels, two people here. Two wheels, two people here. Communication is happening horizontally. I think this rectangular situation, that is them pretending they are in a car. It's terrible. But my favourite types of bikers are these bikers called Royal Enfield bikers. Very nice, damn cute guys. See there are largely two prototypes of Royal Enfield bikers. The first type of Royal Enfield biker is the guy whose body type matches the bike. Six foot tall, six foot tall, understood, going well. But then you have these five foot tall midget guys. They aren't fit to ride an Activa, but they want “Dug Dug” in their life. And I feel bad for them when they get on to the bike. They are just stretching every sinew, “Yes, I can just about reach the handlebar and the brake.” If you take the bike away from them, it looks like they are skydiving horizontally. Aaaargh! Wonderful. But the absolute worst types of bikers, especially in this city and as a Muslim man I feel I have the right to say this... are Muslim bikers. We know this to be true. If you don't know who they are, just drive through Kurla once. You'll just hear them whizz past you. And all the best Muslim bikers, they ride in uniform. And the uniform is kurta, surma and skull cap. And you have to look at the technological advancement. That no matter how fast they ride, the cap never flies off. It's been aerodynamically designed, tested in wind tunnels. Even in the wind tunnels they rotate anti-clockwise because Urdu. But I don't know what it is, like genuinely for all Muslims, a bike is not a means of transportation. For us, it is a means of expression. Like even for me, you give me a bike, the asshole inside me awakens. To put it in terms for younger people to understand, we did not choose the thug life. The thug life chose us. And it happens with everyone. Go to the most sophisticated Muslim man you know. Go to Salman Rushdie, while he is giving Malala Yousafzai a Nobel Peace Prize. Go to him and give him a Yamaha RX-100. In twenty seconds, he'll tear his suit off, lose all sophistication and say, "Malala, let's go to Chakala!" I get very angry when I drive. I have major road rage. Major road rage but I am also a complete pussy. Full coward. When somebody cuts me off on the road, in my head I have beaten the fuck out of him. In my head, I have had sex with his wife and made him watch. In my head. But when it actually comes down to real life, all I can do is, "Hey! You drive carefully, okay." Bastard." "What did you say?" "Not you. Not you. I was telling my son. Tell uncle you're a bastard." But we can't have proper road rage anymore. I've realised you can't have proper road rage because we have modern day cars. And modern day cars have power windows, automatic windows. You can't be properly pissed off with automatic windows. You want true road rage, you need to feel that shit. You need manual windows, "Oh your mom is such a...!" You feel that, right? You feel it. Window's gone all the way down, you're still going... But power windows, are too cool, right? You drive up to someone with power windows, you have to say something cool to them. "I had sex with your wife." And the biggest problem with power windows in modern day cars is that for the power windows, you have four buttons on the driver side. Now the thing is, no matter how long you've owned the car. You're never entirely sure of which button does what. So it leads to this very awkward situation where you are in the heat of battle and you're going, "Hey motherfucker. I am going to whip your ass! Ahh fuck. Hey you come back! I will get you next time." It's terrible. But see eventually when you are driving in this city, you will get into an accident at some point. And I got into an accident the other day. It was very intense. The guy got out of the car, "Hey tall dude. Learn to drive idiot." I was like, "Who are you calling tall? Your dad is tall." He was like, "He's not... This is factually very incorrect.” “Okay we will work on this fight later." But we dealt with this situation like true Bombay men. Like only Bombay men can. We rolled up our sleeves, we cracked our knuckles and we took out our cell phones to call someone else to do the fighting. Because that is a very intrinsic Bombay thing. Everyone in Bombay has that one guy you call when shit goes down. You pick up the phone like, "Bhai, shit's going down! Get over here, bhai!" We have the concept of the “bhai” in Bombay and in northern parts of the country they have that line, "Do you know who my dad is?" In Bombay nobody uses that. Because we know your dad doesn't matter, it's the brothers the sort shit out. You're searching for the wrong relative, my friend. But through interaction with these bhais, I have noticed a lot of things about them. The most confusing aspects about these bhais is that they are full macho, well-built men but they smell of attar. Like it does not compute at all. Like they are smelling of roses and they are coming to beat you up. In my head I'm like, "Do you want to pick a fight with me or pollinate? What's going on?" Like bees are following around like, "Bzzzz pollinate with me, dudebro! Bzzzz. Sabka bee, mawaali bee!" But I've realised that through much research that there are some of these really niche bhais. Who just specialise in sorting out accidents. Like that is their career. That's what they do for a living. And I have a business proposition for these bhais. I propose that we should have a bhai hotline. Where whenever you have an accident, you just call them up. Like, "Assalaamalaikum! Welcome to 786-786 dial-a-bhai. If it's a small problem, press 1. If your car's been shot to shit, press 2. For our extended services, dial AK-47. If your name is Sanjay Dutt, then sorry wrong number." I get very angry when I drive. And also, it's because I listen to the radio while I drive. Give me a round of applause if you listen to the radio while you are driving? You'll know this. That all radio advertisements in this country are made in this parallel universe. Where logic does not exist. Think about what I am saying. Apply this to every ad you've heard. Every radio advertisement is a conversation between two people. Of which one person is unnaturally excited about the information he's being given. Always like, "Bro, have you heard about the iPhone?" "Fuck iPhone, I'll masturbate and come back. Wow, never heard of this!" Either that or it's a conversation between two people of which one person has a problem. And the second person gives him a completely unrelated solution. He's like, "Bro, I just found out I have AIDS." "Oh! You have AIDS? Here's a pension plan!" It's terrible dude. But my favourite advertisement on Indian radio is for this service called Big Basket dot com. You guys have heard of Big Basket. They send you freshly cut fruits and vegetables to your house because who has has time? And they have this ad that plays on the radio, where this stuck-up sort of townie woman who is cutting vegetables. She's cut her finger while cutting vegetables. She's very upset about this. She's like, "Uff!" I mean I assume she is doing that because it's radio, I don't know what she's actually doing. She'll be doing uff or oh! But let's go with, "Uff! I was cutting vegetables. And Neha dashed into me!" Now see in a normal world, you would slap Neha and move on with your life. Simple solution. But not on the radio. Here the husband pops in. He was working in another country. He teleports into the house like, "Hey! Why are you cutting vegetables, when you can get freshly cut vegetables from Big Basket dot com." I'm like, really? This is the solution to your problem? Your offspring is running around the kitchen with knives, injuring members of your household. She is probably juggling knives and stabbing the house help while you are having this conversation. Just lock your kid in the bathroom maybe that's a good idea! That's what my parents used to do. Misbehave, sit in the bathroom, think about what you've done. But no, on the radio they will have an ad for that also. Like, "Uff! I was filling up the bathtub. And Neha drowned. What a bitch!" "Hey! Why are you drowning our kids in a bathtub? Just get a Jacuzzi from Pepperfry dot com." But also you would've noticed on the radio that they play these... All radio channels by default are supposed to play these ads for these outdated government schemes. Always for these things like, "Bharatiya Navnirman Rozgar Yojana." Listen, nobody in this day and age has any idea what those four words mean. Your target audience for this ad is Javed Akhtar. And even he's like, "Bro, this shit is messed up." Or as he would say, "Janaab, ye tatti gambhir hai. Irshaad, motherfucker." Speaking of Javed Akhtar, I have a bit of a problem with old people in this country. Like by old people I mean grandfather level old people in this country. Because beyond a certain age in India, old people do not give a fuck about rules. They break rules and fuck off. "I don't have time for your rules man. I got shit to do. Like YOLO. You Only Live Old. They break rules and fuck off. "I don't have time for your rules man. I got shit to do. Gotta go update my passbook." What is it with old people and passbooks? Every old uncle has a passbook. Which at any given point of time needs to be updated. Passbook I've realised is Android OS for old people. “I want updates, I want updates!” But I don't understand old people at banks. Anytime you go to a bank, there is one old uncle there. They get excited about going to the bank. And I don't know when this switch happens because for most of your life, your attitude towards the bank is like, "Aw man, I've to go to the bank." And then someday something changes and it becomes like, "Aww yeah! Let's go to the bank!" I don't know how that happens. I think in every SBI there is one backroom with a VIP, where there's an Indian classical rave party. All the old uncles are like, "Yeah! Yeah! Wheelchair yeah!" And anytime you go to State Bank of India, there will be this one random old uncle over there. He is just making conversation with random people in the bank. He'll be like, "Son, what do you do? Oh you are a teller? Okay tell me something." You're standing on the side, "Why is grandpa talking to the ATM?" But old people generally get away with a lot of shit in this country that young people cannot. I'll give you an example. I was at the airport the other day, going through the security and I'd forgotten that my phone was in my pocket. The security guard got pissed off. He shouted at me, threw me at the back of the line. This old uncle came after me. I had a phone, he had a full Croma outlet in his pockets. There was shit there he had forgotten existed. I shit you not, at one point he pulled out four handkerchiefs back to back from the same pocket. This is P. C. Sorcar with Alzheimer's over here. "What's happening? When will this end? I did not know I still had this trick." Takes his hat off, some pigeon flies out. Amazing. But for him the attitude was completely different. They were like, "Come grandpa! It's okay, happens in old age! Oh, you dropped your passbook grandpa. Come grandpa, come!" That's the attitude we have. The best example I can give you is the last elections we had. Rahul Gandhi young guy, Narendra Modi old guy. You know where this is going. So Rahul Gandhi said three stupid things. We were like, "Idiot, please leave.” Go to Thailand. Please leave. Go please. Modiji come, please! Come Modiji. Oh but bro demonetization, thousand buck notes? It happens in old age! Come Modiji. Come. Modiji come. You dropped your passbook, Modiji." But see, I am not here to bitch about old people. I hate young people equally. I don't understand teenagers. Like sixteen year olds of this generation. I do not understand. It starts from the fundamental basic things that they do. Like the music that sixteen year olds listen to. Right now we have this phenomenon called Electronic Dance Music, EDM. Where every EDM concert is the same. There is this one DJ who is up on the stage. And he is using all his creativity and talent, which is also called a pen drive. And he pulls off these amazing skilled manoeuvres like pressing the spacebar. Like oh! VLC yo, come on. And all the kids in the crowd, you'll see this. All the kids in the crowd, they do this dance where they pretend to slice bread in the air. Have you seen that? Then mid-way they get excited like, “Put it in the toaster, put it in the toaster!” They are making toast, what are you doing? I genuinely do not understand what talent it requires to be an EDM DJ. I was listening to one of the interviews to one of these DJs. What's his name? Axwell, Dicksmall, one of those guys. He is very seriously giving this interview. He's like, "You got to know when to press the right buttons, man. You got to know when to take them up and bring them down." I'm like bro, you make up your mind. Are you a DJ or a liftman? Even pop music these days. Like back in the day we had meaningful lyrics to pop songs. You think of like Sting, Desert Rose. “I dream of rain, I dream of gardens in the desert sun”, beautiful. These days chart topping hit by Rihanna, "Work, work, work, work, work." Once more? Okay! "Work, work, work, work, work." For a song that is called Work, very little work has gone into this. And Justin Bieber doesn't know what's happening in his own songs. He's like, "What do you mean?" "Sorry." But Justin Bieber is of course coming down and performing soon in this country. I saw Facebook updates of one of the people on my timeline. He said, "Just spent the last rupees of my bank account for Justin Bieber ticket." I don't know if there is an emoticon for that. I was like wow, he spent his last rupees of his account on Justin Bieber ticket. Aww! All his money is gone. Poor guy doesn't know show is in Navi Mumbai. Who's going to give him money for the toll? It's wonderful. I try to fit in with the youngsters of today. I do cool things. I bought a MacBook recently because I really wanted to go to Starbucks. No, they don't let you in! There is a guy outside Starbucks, he checks your laptop. He's like, "Windows? CCD is down there. Fuck off! Get out!!" But I can't have a conversation with a sixteen year old anymore. I've tried. Like I was sitting with my sixteen year old niece and all through the conversation, she kept making faces at her phone. Like, "Yea, absolutely. I agree completely." I was like what's going on? I thought she is having a stroke or something. I started doing CPR. Are you alive? Please. I said, "What are you doing?" She was like, "I'm sending a Snapchat to my friends." This is how far we have evolved as a species. Where it was not enough to have emoticons on instant messaging, we have now become the fucking emoticons! That is the evolution of man. Like ape, Neanderthal, man... Ridiculous. Can you picture Snapchat happening in a closed environment? Just two people sitting in one room across a table. Communicating with filters on Snapchat. Even deaf and dumb people are looking at them and going, "Pfft! I think they are retarded, bro. Oh shit, I can speak. This is weird." It's terrible. This Snapchat obsession is too much and for most teenagers these days, the most exciting part of the day is like, "Bro! I opened Snapchat today, bro. And I took that guy's face and I put it on my face. And now he has my face and I have his face. And we have each other's faces, bro. Now we'll do Sachin Tendulkar, Lata Mangeshkar, FIR. Yaay." It's too much. I find it hard to keep up with technology right now. I have a nephew, he has this virtual reality headset, VR headset which he uses all the time. He wears it all the time, even during family functions. He's wearing it... Looking like a low budget Robocop. I don't understand. And keeping with the trend of virtual reality, we had this thing called Pokémon Go, last year. Dude, what the fuck was that? See, I'll level with you. I play a lot of video games. I have played a videogame called Goat Simulator. That is the level of geek I am. Although you'd argue that most Muslim men have played some variant of this game at some point. You know. Point being, I have played a lot of video games. But this Pokémon Go thing was beyond my comprehension. I was walking down the road, minding my own business. These two kids ran past me, swiping furiously on their phones, "Gotta catch them all bro, gotta catch them all!" I was looking at them, no context. I was like, "Dude, Tinder has changed a lot man. Got to catch them all? I can't even match with one girl! What's happening?!" For those of you who don't know what Pokémon Go is, I'll explain to you what the game is. For those of you who have played Pokémon Go, I will explain to you what you look like... to regular human beings. So the process of Pokémon Go is as follows. There are these imaginary creatures called Pokémons. They are scattered all across the world, you can find them in malls, in colleges, in temples. Although you'd argue that this is not the first time people go to temples searching for imaginary creatures. But there's a lot of them, right? And now what you have to do is that you have to catch these imaginary creatures. How do you catch them, I hear you asking. Good question. You have to catch them by throwing imaginary balls at them. And then these imaginary creatures start living inside these imaginary balls. They've been smoking the good shit. Amazing. And that is obviously standard hunting procedure. Like you throw balls at animals in a jungle. See a tiger, throw a ball at him. Even the tiger is like, "Wow, you threw a ball at me?" My greatest weakness. Let's play cricket." What is most interesting is the process you employ to throw these Pokémon balls. What you have to do is that you take your index finger and swipe it across your screen. So this means that you are pointing to an imaginary object that does not exist. Pointing towards it and doing this to it. Now I understand that this gesture has been the refuge of many lonely men in this country. But there is a time and a place. But what makes things worse is that you are not alone. There are twenty other people trying to catch the same Pokémon. And now there is a circle of you pointing to nothing in particular. Just having this virtual mujra. Like, "Yeah, gotta catch them all bro! Yeah! Come on." I genuinely found this Pokémon technology very scary. Because you get a notification on your phone saying there is a Pokémon in this building, you will blindly go and follow it. If ISIS had hacked this technology, you would all be screwed. You'd all be going searching for your Pokémon and walk into a building and then suddenly there's seventeen suicide bombers saying, "Surprise, motherfucker." But you are so into your game, you'll be like, "Out of the way, Jihadi, I've got Pokemons to find. Gotta catch them all bro. Gotta catch them all." I don't understand children. It starts from like the lowest level of child like two-three year olds. I hate three year old kids. They're assholes. And this is a big problem in society that we need to address. That parents are not slapping their kids enough. We need to address it especially at home they'll give full rapaat zapaat. No problem. But in public they don't slap their kids anymore. I miss that. Remember the good old days, when you are walking down the road and you see a kid being an asshole and you hear one phataak. Yes, congratulations. "Happy birthday to you!” They used to do that right. But these days parents aren't slapping their kids. That's why all the kids these days are like, "I want to be a photographer. Traveller, wanderluster." In our time, "Engineer, arranged marriage! Get out of here!" Discipline. I have this nephew I must tell you about. He's an asshole Of the first order. And I was at a mall the other day with one of my cousins and his kid is running amok. He has spilled some aunty's coffee. He has head butted some uncle on his crotch. Uncle is like, "Who's shitty kid is this? Crap, I dropped my passbook!" Annoying! And I turned to my cousin and said, "Why are you not slapping your kid?" And he was like, "No, we can't. Society will judge us." I was like, "Dude look around you. Society wants you to slap that motherfucker!" Next time you see an annoying kid in public, just go slap. Even if it is not your own, go for it. Because what will happen is there will be the slap. There will be the echo of the slap. There will be three seconds of silence. People's heads will turn and then... applause. "This man is a hero. Give him a national award!" But there is just so much complexity in young kids these days. I was at a Baskin Robbins outlet the other day and there were these three or four girls. They must've been four years old at best. They were running around the shop doing, “Ringa Ringa roses” and all that fun stuff is happening. And then one of these girls went to order her ice-cream. The guy behind the counter asked her what flavour she wanted. I swear to you, verbatim. This is what she said. "You know I like Bavarian chocolate. But I don't like like it. And my mom says that chocolate makes you fat anyway. So what would you recommend?" Four year old girl! She went from Teletubbies to Sex And The City in three seconds. Even the guy behind the counter was confused. He was like *gibberish* Last I heard he just said, "Yeh gormint bik chuki hai." And he fucked off. But there was none of this complexity in the ice-cream decision process when we were growing up. The ice-cream decision process was simple. It was binary. It was just yes, no. None of these flavours, forget binary, it was unary. It was just yes. "What flavour do you want?" "Yes." "He'll have one Yes, please." That's it. So much complexity. I have a two year old niece or nephew, I don't know, I've made them up for the sake of this joke. But you see two year old kids playing Angry Birds on iPads. When I was two years old, you gave me an iPad, I would put it in my mouth. I'd be like, "Look daddy, I'm a doggy." But I judge kids these days. I judge the ten-twelve year old kids because they have so much shit that I didn't have growing up. Like they have like smart phones, iPhones, Samsung S7 phones. I had this one phone growing up, a lot of you would have had this. It was called a Nokia 1100. How many of you guys had that phone? Just, what a phone! What a phone! You throw it around, you feed it to your dog, your dog shits it out, it STILL works. These days, you want new features on a phone, you have to wait for a software update. On a Nokia 1100, you want new features, you just drop it. You pick it up, new colours on the screen. It's amazing. And if you drop an iPhone, to repair it you have to pay five thousand rupees. If you drop a Nokia 1100, to repair it you just drop it again. Problem solved! I judge kids. Ten-twelve year old kids, they have PlayStations, iPads. I had none of that. Age ten, I had this one hand held video game which a lot of you would've had. It was called 999-Games-in-One. All of you guys had that. And you got that game thinking “Wow, 999 games! I will never be bored again.” Until you realise it's three games repeated 333 times. Snake, Tetris, Space Invaders. That's it. And the same way, that I judge these kids for having PlayStations and iPads. My dad used to judge me for having 999-Games-in-One. He'd come to me, very judgmental. "What is this game you're playing?" "Dad it's a game called Snake. You guide a snake, if it dies you lose." "Even we used to play snake. We had to go into the jungle and find a snake. And if we lost, WE died! Bloody kid. What else? What other games?" "Dad this game called Tetris. You build stuff with blocks, you get high score." "I've played that also. You know what my high score is? This house! Bloody kid." That was my dad's tagline, whenever he was shouting at me. "Bloody kid." I'm like, "Dad you're so nice." But so as you can see with these crazy thoughts in my head, I was single for a very long period in my life. Engineering was also to blame for that. And so what I would do is, I had no game in college. Like zero game at all. So my only strategy was to go after women who were already in dodgy relationships, hoping to get a rebound. And lot of men have done this. Basically in the Facebook generation, what you do as part of the strategy is that you stalk women on Facebook. And you're always on the lookout for that one sad status update. Because women only post sad shit when there is trouble in their relationship. On normal days it'll be like, "Rainbows and unicorns and wombs lalalalala..." But when there is trouble in their relationship, there's deep philosophical quotes. “It takes the devil inside of me to know the devil inside of him.” And that's when we as single men descend like vultures into your comment section. And we put in a little innocent comment saying, "What happened?" If you are desperately single you will say, "What happened, dear?" And then the girl will reply saying, "Oh nothing. But thank you for your concern." “Concern!” Ladies let me tell you this right now. That is not concern. That is hope! So I got married three years ago and in general it's very hard getting married in this country because there is a lot of things that you have to take care of. First thing is that you have to start teaching people grammar. Because there are two words pertaining to getting married in this country. The first word is wedding, which is the day of the ceremony, the day you get married. The second word is marriage which is the rest of your married life. Now in India, we find there is no difference between these two words at all. One of my friends, she came up to me so excited, "Azeem I am so excited. I am coming for your marriage." "All of it? Like listen, I am up for threesomes but this is just creepy man. Come on. We will have to change the wedding card now. It's going to be Azeem weds Sana featuring Priyanka. Sounds like a Pitbull track now. I hope you are happy." But it's very difficult, it was very hard for me getting married because I'm a thin person. And as a thin person in this country, you live a horrible life. Because everywhere you go, your friends, your relatives are constantly asking you to put on weight. "Put on some weight bro. What are you doing with your life?" At which point I take a bite into my double cheeseburger and say, "I am trying motherfucker. It's not working." All thin people back me up on this. On behalf of all thin people, I just want to say that we don't look like this out of choice. Stick figure is not the form factor that we were going for. A lot of my fat friends, they don't appreciate the struggles of thin people. They'll come up to us full judging, "Look at him bloody thin bastard. So thin, he's gone jogging? Bloody bastard." And guys I just want to say I am not jogging, it's just sometimes when I go for a walk, the wind picks up behind me and I don't have to a choice, just have to go with it. Wait for land breeze to turn into sea-breeze then I can come back home, study geography on the way. It's terrible. But this is my problem with society in India that you're not allowed to make fun of fat people. People get all emotional like, "No man. Don't make fun of fat people. You have to appreciate the person inside." I'm like fuck, there's a person inside him? How much is he eating? Is he mad? But thin people, people make fun of us all the time. Because what are we going to do? Beat you up? Which is why invariably, all the thin people will back me up on this. You have this one line which you've heard at some point in your life. Where people will come up to you as a thin person and they'll judge you and they'll be like, "Hey skinny fucker! Don't you get food at home?" I hate that line, “Don't you get food at home?” And as Indians we are assholes. We'll go to fricking Ethiopia. We'll see a starving kid and be like, "Hey, Tatenda Taibu. Hey, Henry Olonga. Hey, Zimbabwean cricketer name. Don't you get food at home?" They'll be like, "No! I don't even have a home. You want to buy me one, asshole?" "Simba?" But see the one place you never want to be as a thin person, it's at an Indian wedding. Because at all Indian weddings, there exists this one species, some of you are in tonight... called the aunty. And the aunties, they prowl the night. They roam around the reception hall in packs of four. In matching sarees, holding laddus like hand grenades. Just throwing it at the nearest thin person, "Eat! Nobody will marry you! Eat!!" Like, "Aunty it's MY wedding, relax. It's okay. We have sealed the deal here." But the one thing I will never understand about Indian weddings is the dancing. Because at all Indian weddings there is a fixed template which is at about 10:30-11 at night... really shady Bollywood songs start to play. And people start forming circles. Now once the circles have been formed, they send out scouts. To the far ends of the reception hall. To find that one poor idiot who doesn't want to dance. Usually me. And they throw you in the centre of the circle like, "Dance, dance! Why are you not dancing bro, why are you not dancing bro? One-two steps bro, one-two steps." I'm like, "I can't dance, I have no coordination in my legs. It's a bad idea." "Arrey, how you don't have coordination? Everyone has coordination." "What do you mean HOW? The cerebellum and neural networks are not connected. What do you want me to say?" "Arrey, screw your cerebellum. Do balam pichkari bro! Balam pichkari." "I do not want to dance." "Oh! Fine bro. But you should eat something, you've become damn thin these days." Listen if you want to dance, go ahead and dance. You don't have to force other people to dance with you. For instance, I like to read. But you will never see me showing up at a wedding with a copy of Lord of The Rings. Just going to be, "Hey read no, read no! Why are you not reading bro? Make circle and form book club bro. One-two pages bro, one-two pages. Come on." Doesn't happen. But I got married and my mother's very happy about this. I have a mother, yes. That's usually how it works out biologically. But I have an Indian mother and all Indian mothers, they do this. Irrespective of who they are. Indian mothers, they spy on you. Under the pretext of cleaning your room. Like the moment I leave my house, my mom puts on this Sherlock Holmes cap and magnifying glass. "According to the wrinkles on this bedsheet, a girl slept here seventeen days ago. What do you think, Watson?" My dad's been dressed up as Watson for no reason, "Please let me go to work, we have no money left. Why are we doing this?" But every time as a single guy, I would come home and see my room clean, I would panic. I'm like, "Shit. What has she found now?" Running around the room trying to hide the evidence like a Gujarati in a tax raid. Hide the evidence. And then my mom walks in, full swag. Like, "So? So? So? I was cleaning your room and I found this pack of cigarettes." I'm like, "Oh! I'm sorry mom, I didn't know the back of the tube light needed to be cleaned. But okay." And even when they are cleaning, Indian mothers they do this. They pick up something that you've deliberately, purposefully, thoughtfully kept over here. And she'll pick it up, she will keep it here. Because that's where she feels it should be kept. Which leads to a situation where like, "Mom, where is my watch?" "Your watch? Come son, come." Takes me to a drawer that I did not know existed before. "Here is your watch." And then the clinching dialogue. I love this one. "Son, what would you do without me." I'd be able to find my fricking watch for starters. But you can't say such things to mothers because mothers have delicate emotions. I've realised that mothers are a lot like girlfriends. The key difference, and pay attention here. The key difference is that you can break-up with your girlfriend. You can't break-up with your mother. It's a very awkward conversation to have. "Like you know mom, we've been together really long time. First nine months was very nice. First nine months, superb. I need to see other mothers now, man." Go out and get drunk and start drunk dialling your friend's mothers like, "Hi aunty. Hiiii! I was wondering if you want to make parathas for me sometime. Also, have you seen my watch anywhere? I can't find it." But no matter what happens, Indian mothers you have to give them this. That an Indian mother has always got your back, right? You can come home and say, "Mom, I failed my exam today." She'll be like, "Okay son. Don't worry. You will do better next time." You can come home and say, "I ran over three people in the car today." Like, "Okay son, don't worry we'll blame the driver for it." But if you come home and say, "You know mom, I won't be home for dinner tonight." "Excuse me? You won't be home for dinner tonight? Who the hell is going to eat this food? Do you know there are children starving in Africa? They have to run around catching babies from the sky on top of that. Do you have any idea of their struggles?" I'm like, "Fine. Send it to them. Clearly, they need it more than I do." She's like, "Fine, fine. Go out. Go out. What do I care? What do I care?" And then you leave the drama, she turns back. "I'm just going to clean his room!" I've been married for over two and a half years now. When you get married, all your friends will be like, "Bro, why are you doing this bro? It's hard work, bro. You are screwed. It's over. It's over. Why are you doing this? Who will come to Thailand with me?” I've been married almost three years now. Life's been pretty sorted. I went to my dad and I asked my dad, "Why do people say that it is difficult to be married?" My dad looked me in the eye. And he said, "Give it time. One day you will know. That day will come. Bloody kid." "Thanks for the positivity, dad." See once you're in a relationship for long enough, you will learn that you have to pick your battles with your partner. There are some fights that you cannot win. No matter how hard you try. For me and my wife, like I have resigned myself to that fact that I will never get to a social gathering or a party on time with my wife. Because I know she takes a while to get ready. But then I started thinking, why do women take a while to get ready and I've figured it out, ladies and gentlemen. See, the biggest bottleneck in the getting ready process is the picking out of the dress. Because this is what my wife does. She opens her cupboard and her cupboard is not a cupboard. It is a jungle. There are clothes there that are so old, they have mutated and transformed into living organisms, alright! You open the cupboard, there are like bras flying around like pterodactyls. “BRA! BRA!” Fuck! Scary! But this is what my wife does. She opens her cupboard and she stares. And continues to stare and then thirty minutes into staring, into an endless barrage of clothes. She concludes, "I have nothing to wear." How? I'm looking at that cupboard and I'm like, "In one cupboard you've managed to WinZip all of Zara's summer and winter collection." How is this possible? But see once you've been married or been in a relationship for long enough, you will realise that the same things start happening over and over again. You start having the same conversations with your partner over and over again. And I've realised in my relationship, every conversation we have can be summed up in three words. And these three words are, Something, anything and nothing. Every conversation. Wife comes up like, "Hey, what are you doing?" "Nothing." "You want to do something?" "Okay, let's do something. What do you want to do?" "Anything." "Anything specific?" "Oh nothing, why don't you think of something?" "Something like what?" "Anything." "Listen, why do I have to think of something? You think of something." "Fine, let's not do anything." "What happened?" "Nothing." Women are geniuses. Women have these amazing ability to give us as men what we want. At the exact moment... that we do not want it. And the best example I can give you is this genius invention that women have come up with called the silent treatment. Because see, as a man no matter how much you love your girlfriend or wife or hooker or whatever you're into. No matter how much you love your girl, in some tiny corner of your brain you are thinking, "When will she stop talking? When will she stop talking? When will she stop talking?" And then one day, she stops talking and now when your universe is turned upside down. You're like, "Why is she not talking? Why is she not talking? Why is she not talking?" And when this happens, as a man you start looking back at your past 24 hours. It's like solving a murder mystery but backwards. Because you know who the culprit is. It's you. Now you need to find the evidence to identify the crime. You start thinking, okay what did I do today? I had breakfast, no that's not it. I went to the bathroom. No I have permission to do that. Accepted friend request from ex-girlfriend. Oh! That's the one! And once you have identified your crime as a man, you have two options. If it's a big crime, you are screwed. Start preparing your apology, there is no way out of this. But if it's a small crime, you can counter her silent treatment with your own silent treatment. "You won't talk to me? I also won't talk to you. Alpha male yo!" This lasts for one hour. After which you realise you have to apologise anyway. And then you go to apologise like, "Baby, baby! Say something." "I don't want to say anything." "Baby, say something." "I will say nothing." "Baby, I am sorry." "For what?" "Everything." But there is that little interim period at the beginning of the silent treatment whereas a man you can enjoy the silence and get away with it. “She's not talking to me. This is nice, I like this. Oh shit, she's looking. Look sad. Look sad. Look sad.” It happens, right. So now me and my wife, we live with my parents obviously because it's Bombay and I do this with my life. An generally my wife and mother get along pretty well but eventually that little saas-bahu cold war in every household will start happening. If it didn't happen, Ekta Kapoor would not have a career. It starts happening and it's slightly started happening now. Where my wife come running to me and she's like, "What is this? Your mom's not talking to me. I don't understand what I did." And I was like, "AHA! Now you know what that's like." Because see, this is the first time that she's in a relationship with a woman. She has no idea how to deal with this situation. My mom's skill level is too high. For the younger people, I'll put this in FIFA video game terms. My wife is semi-pro and mother is legend. There is no comparison. My mom's like, "I've been preparing this for forty years, you bring it! I practiced on my mother-in-law for 10 years! And she's dead now. The Lannisters send their regards." But as a married man living in the same house with your wife and your parents, at some point it will happen where you will fight with your wife and your mother at the same time. And this is the worst time of your existence... as a multicellular organism. Because my wife is not talking to me, she is pissed off. I'm like okay, can't sit in my bedroom. Alright, I'll go out and sit in the living room. Go in to the living room, my mom's sitting there, she is also not talking to me. I'm like okay, where the hell do I go now? Alright, I'll go out and sit in the kitchen. Go into the kitchen, my dad's there. "Hi, what's up?" He lights up a cigarette, he pours a drink and hands it to me and he says, "I told you this day would come. Bloody kid." You guys have been fantastic. That's been my show, thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you guys!
