Enjoying yourself? You are in violation of the Clean Air. Clean Mind Act of 2005. The minimum penalty is one year. This is unit SR71 in pursuit of suspect, request backup. Kenneth Chang. Your file indicates you haven't paid income taxes of three years. Tax evasion is a capital crime. It's the games for you, scumbag. Let's go. Good evening, I'm Marty Dobbs. Die in the game, die in life. Catch phrase for The Games, the most popular entertainment of this new century where champion hunters pursue their human prey across virtual reality replications of historical scenarios. The prey, convicts from the VR prison system. The only rule for these hapless criminals. Die the game, die in life! Die in the game, die in life! Die in the game, die in life! Die in the game, die in life! Die in the game, die in life! Critics call The Games barbaric and wonder how society ever came to accept them. Let's look back to the civil unrest at the turn of the century. Out of control tax rates triggered the depression of 2002. Over half the employers in America are driven out of business. Crime rates skyrocket. With prison space running out, congress mandates the death penalty for a host of lesser offenses. Gun ownership and speech code violations join murder and treason as capital crimes. But social unrest grows. That's a lie, he's a liar! HQ, this is unit three, sector seven is all clear. I repeat, sector seven is all clear. Roger that unit three, move on to sector 16, repeat, move on to sector 16. Billionaire recluse, R.D. Crowley, inventor of the popular virtual reality prison presents the crumbling government with the solution. A new approach to the death penalty. The Games. It's execution as mass entertainment. And soon, the games are played 24 hours a day and broadcast everywhere. Die in the game, die in life! The planet goes wild for that. As the life and death struggle of The Game takes the public mind off crime and unemployment. The United Nation creates the Department of Gaming and names Crowley it's permanent director. The code for these contains thousands of gigabytes of information. That's a mere fraction of what the human brain owns. People are dangerous, unpredictable. Their survival instinct allows them to react instantaneously. Now that would make for some exciting play. Or critics charge, makes an opiate for the masses. Games allow people a catharsis. It's a socially positive effect. Games encourage the citizenry to behave in a more civil fashion. It's all very clean and painless. The convict's body is held in frozen suspension. Their minds, however, inhabit our VR prison. As for the executions, they're quite painless. But stories have been surfacing, ugly tales of convicts body parts being sold for a profit on the international black market. And to add to the controversy, in recent months, a small band of rebels have been freeing prisoners on their way to the game. These rebels are mutineers, leftovers of American military units who refuse to surrender to the UN takeover for Pentagon in 2003. Do they spell real trouble for Crowley and his game? The rebels pose no threat to us. They're nothing. They're mutineers, traitors to their country. We will stomp them out. Processing prisoner transfer. Are you sure there's prisoners here? This was a food warehouse. Now, they hold prisoners for the games. It's fucked up. What? We were soldiers, man. We used to defend this country. Now, we're attacking it. Well, they're doing this wrong, Stu. This is not the country we swore to protect. You ready to do some damage? Let's do it. Let's fuck some shit up. You see, you got this all wrong. Hey, what's going on? Is that Logan? Intruder alert. Some other, 15. All units, our guest have arrived. I'm on my way. It's time to spring the trap. Units three and seven, move in to assault position. Bay 23, repeat, bay 23. Units three and seven, attack. Attack! Drop the gun now! Drop it! Drop it! All of you, drop your weapons! I have your leader here! Drop your weapons! Drop your weapons, all of you. Let's go! Go! Now, let's go! Stu, go! I'll hold them off, go! Don't you fucking move. You little scum. Get that scum outta here. I can't feel my legs. Insects and animals. They fight for food, territory and the right to mate. Snake has venom. Lion, fangs and claws. Even the primitive red ant has the poison. But men, men doesn't posses such natural attributes so we rely on imagination and device our own weapons. Iron, steel, gun powder. Poof! We had them. But underneath it all hides just two insects. Fighting food and the right the copulate. Did you call me in here just to lecture me? Of course. You might be a friend that I set up security or charge with the task of finding out who was infiltrating my program and exterminating them. You haven't done a very good job. If you love your game so much, why don't you play, Crowley? I would love to meet you in a world where this chair didn't come between us. How ungrateful. You're lucky to be alive. You wouldn't be sitting here now if my surgeons didn't save your life. Heinz Dietrich, report to game facility. My don't you go empty at the lost that you've been. System boot complete. Hunters, prepare for virtual insertion. Have a good game. So, Montgomery. What do you think about tournament of arms? A little tame for my taste. Prepare prisoners for virtual insertion. Willy. Wake up, rise and shine. Prisoners online. It's Prime Time Game time! Starring champion hunters, Heinz Dietrich! And Montgomery Valentine. Squaring off against our champions, convict number 312113, Rourke Graham! And for his 518th of Prime Time Games, former terrorist leader, Will Singleton! Who challenges Sir Rourke? Shit! First, why do I have to go first? I challenge. Challenge is accepted! Knights, prepare for battle. Rourke! Rourke! Rourke! For Rourke! A curse upon you, Sir Dietrich. Save Sir Rourke. Come on, kid. You can do it. You're beat, lad. No, no! No! No! Boo! Disgrace! You're no knight! Boo! You soiled your shield, Dietrich! Boo! You're next, Will. Alas, he's dead! Crowley, take me out now. Wake him up. I wanna see his eyes. My god. I thought I was... Dead. You are. But I like to watch. No. No, please. Please, no. You know the rules. Die in the game, die in life! Die in the game, die in life! No! You son of a bitch. Leave my mother out of this. Die in the game, die in life! Die in the game, die in life! No! You fought like a coward. Die like a coward. Die in the game, die in life! Die in the game, die in life! Die in life! Die in life! Die in life! Get this filth out of here. Damn, it's good to be alive. Cadaver reclamation commencing. Sanitation start. Report to effective. Communications link up in progress. Systems connected. Have a nice day. Okay, give it a try. What do you know? It actually works. There's Will. Get in there, get a lock. We can't risk a trace. Okay. Here I go. He is dead! Traitor! Well done, Will. Well done. To the death, sir! Death, death, death, death, death, death, death! Death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death! Death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death! Yeah! Yeah! Death, death, death, death, death, death, death! Death, death, death, death, death, death, death! Death, death, death, death, death, death, death! Death, death, death, death, death, death, death! Yeah! Yeah! Long live Sir William! Interesting. Very good. Fuck. Did you get in? The game ended before I could find my way. Fuck! It worked. Yeah, it fucking worked. That man is a sick, twisted bastard. Stop complaining, Montgomery. You help make him what he is. I can't stand losing to him. I could reach out right now, break his neck with my bare hands! But you won't because killing him like that would be his victory. I suppose. Mr. Dietrich, I need to see you. Can't it wait, Crowley? Only if you wanna die. Send Singleton to his room. We have a problem, Heinz. Yeah, the hacker. We put a trace on him but he's very, very good. You have to be better. You know, Heiny, I think that all this VR gaming has diminished your mental acuity. Crowley, why do you let me play? Well, it amuses me to see your frustrated attempts of trying to best Singleton. But even more than that, it's, it's that delicious look of sorrow that you get on your face when you come out of the game. And face the reality of the pathetic shell of a man you really are. Will, good morning or good evening. I have a surprise for you. A gift to my finest warrior. And believe me it's, say, no cigar. Who are you? I'm Vikki. You're Will, right? Don't you want me? You're not real. You're just a bunch of ones and zeros. I'm not real? I'm real, Will. I'm a prisoner too. There's a real me on a slab somewhere just like you. Getting off on this, Crowley? Come on, Will. This can't be worse than killing people all day? The fuck do you know about it? Killing, fucking. We're all whores for Crowley. I was only sent to give you pleasure. Give me pleasure or give him pleasure? You don't even know, do you? Okay, Crowley. I'll give you a show. You need rest. I'm fine. He doesn't have to last much longer. Tron's almost done with the virus. I gotta go back to him. I gotta let him know... That's dangerous. I don't care. It's not just Will. You have to think all of them. Will stayed in the game so that I can be free. I owe him. And we're going to save him. I thought you said you needed some rest. You need rest. I need sex. Guess who wins? You. You're in big fucking trouble, lady! Don't you know who I am? Yeah, I know who you are. Yes, and who are the hell are you? I'm Hillary. I work for Heinz Dietrich. You should be very proud of your investigative skills, Mr. Tops. Your newest reports are getting close enough to the truth to make you dangerous to me. Hillary, darling. Yes, Papa? What are kidneys going for on the black market these days? $600,000 a piece. Not to mention various and sundry other organs. So we may actually make a profit. Take this piece of filth away. Hey! - Get your hands off me! - Keep him alive until surgery. I want him fresh. I want my fire! Good work, child. I have to go now. I'm playing Mr. Valentine in the games. Valentine. An interesting man. I wasn't aware you two had met. Papa, don't be jealous. I've watched him in the games. Valentine intrigues me. How so? He's rich, powerful. Why does he bother playing your games? If I was him, I'd just start my own. Checking him, he has the technology. So what's to stop him from stealing it? Let's go, child. Form a line! Form a line! The south wall! Indians at the south wall! Fire, men! Bayonets! Charge! Beat! - Crash the door, men! - Beat! - Crash the door! - Beat! Beat! The barricades! They're smashing it in! Beat! - Very good! - Beat! Very good! Over here! Damn! Convict? Eli. Will. Be careful, man. Go! You know, Andrei catch you two around in cyberspace again. He's gonna kick your ass. Yeah, well, you deal with Crowley's security system, I'll deal with the uber babe. I bet you will. Program intrusion in progress. Programming, our uninvited guest is back. We're already tracing that, sir. I don't want him traced, I want him found. Stu! Stu, wait! Fuck this Dietrich! Will, I don't have any time. I'm on the outside. There's a bunch of us out there. We're trying to get you out. Look, just keep fighting, all right? I'm with you, buddy. Just keep fighting. All this technology, these machines and men. The best money can buy and non of it can answer one simple question. Who's been hacking my games? But I bet you can, Will. You know, don't you? All I know is someday, I'll break your neck with my bare hands. Words. Series of vibrations propagating through the air. Why stoop to such vague, useless threats? Threats? You wanna talk about threats? What about the threat I live under everyday? Win or die. Look, I'll make you a deal. You tell me who's been hacking my system and I'll set you free. And I'm supposed to believe that? Whatever else I may be, I'm a man of my word. And no one knows that more than you. The answer's no. Not ever. I admire your tenacity. That's why you survive for so long. I mean you're not best fighter, strongest, fast or smartest. Not by a long shot. But you have tenacity. You never quit. And I never will. Good boy. Shit, man. This feels real. Let me guess. First time in the games. Yeah, they just put me in. Another fucking new guy. We don't even have any weapons. Nobody said the games were perfect, kid. Be careful. They almost traced you last time. I'm just watching. You sick bastard. You don't find this stimulating? You're history. Back off, Singleton or I'll kill the girl. Go ahead. She's not real. Will. Will, help me. Vikki. Help me, please. Fuck! They got him. I'm going in. You're not looking good, Singleton. If you beg, I'll do it quickly. You idiot! I had to save him. Now what? Dietrich beat him. They're gonna execute him unless he gets away. Launching neural pulse now. Have a nice day. Will? Will, we don't have much time. 9066-7C, Nashville. One of the guys will meet you there. Good luck, buddy. Hack Crowley security monitor net. I want you take out the alarms, the intercom, all systems. There's no way he can make it out of there. Actually, the odds aren't much worse than 103,345 to one. Bag it, Tron. All right, now, get his security system online. Good. Now keep sending false alarms. That's it. Draw the guards away from him. What the hell do you think you're going in there like that? A half-brain monkey could've traced that. He was gonna kill Will. Yes, he was. But now, our whole plan is in jeopardy. I'm just supposed to watch him die? Life's a bitch. Yeah, well, that makes two of you. He's actually gonna make it out of there. I'll go get him. No, stay here. I'll go topside, I'll get him. This way. Thanks, kid. Number five, all units, intercept! Security breach, sector six. I'm taking you to Stu. Security! Stop them. All units. No, no, no. Can't you see that they're escaping? Stop them, security! All units, stop them! They're headed for the roof! Come on, move, move! They're heading north. Wait, sector seven. Dispatch the armored unit to intercept. Units one and five, move to defensive perimeter. I repeat, move to defensive perimeter. Fucking ambush! You think we have time for that? There they are, there they are! Fire at will. Fire at will! All units fire! Fire, fire! He's throwing frags! He's throwing frags! Shit! We lost plane six! Repeat, plane six is down! Can't shoot you out. He's in our own units! No sign of them, sir. Did we get them? Did we get them? Negative, they're gone. Repeat, they're gone, Son of a bitch! What a ride! What do you mean they've escaped your trap? Dispatch the hunter units. I want a hot target search. Expand to four sectors, now! Move! Um, Mr. Dietrich, we have finished that trace. Screen. Mr. Valentine. So you're the traitor. Game over for you. Let's go in. What do you mean? Aren't we gonna meet Stu? No, not yet. Just in case they're following us, I don't wanna leave them back to headquarters. You are so good. Tiger woman. What you say your name was? I'm Hillary. Hillary Dietrich. Dietrich. Dietrich's daughter. Whoa. Someone's been hacking into the system. He thinks that it might be you. So, he sent you here to pump some information into me? Doesn't go as planned, did it? Actually, it was my idea to fuck you. Papa just wanted me to kill you. Kill me? A sweet little thing like you. Unit three, move into assault position. Levcec, Fuller, take the right side. All quiet so far. Recon with the ranch down. Move into attack. All clear here. Christ, they've spotted us. Levcec's been hit! Levcec's been hit! I see him. Move it, move it! Man down, man down. Move it, move it! Now's our chance, move it, move it! Come on, you flukes. Move, move! I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit! I never thanked you for saving me. My pleasure. You were a prisoner. What they get you for? They didn't. Snatched off the street, thrown in a... A sex program. A rape program. For men who got off on sexual assault. Safe and authentic. Jesus. Two, three times a day. The worst part was I got used to it and stopped fighting so hard. I decided it was my life's mission to get Crowley. Crowley and Dietrich. Heinz Dietrich? How do you know him? My biggest customer. I'm sorry. Don't be. Dietrich and Crowley tried to break me. They never did. I'm as whole as I ever was. I monitored your trace. You neglected to take into account. The hacker may have ghosted a signal through Valentine's facility. You killed a loyal, innocent customer. If only I had a mind like yours, Crowley. Well, don't worry. I'll find the real hacker. You have my word on it. Lets hope so. Because the price of failure is high. You mean I can't go in the game? No, you'll play. Just not on the hunter side. You wouldn't dare. And better yet, perhaps your daughter would make an amusing quarry. You leave my Hillary out of it. Geez, I didn't think you were capable of emotion. Perhaps there's a little spark of humanity in you. Don't count on it. Don't worry. I won't. Fine. Hey, Will. Might be best if we didn't tell Stu about what happened earlier. He's sensitive. Identity scan, complete. Welcome, friendly person. Have a nice day. Will! I didn't think I'd ever see you again. Fuck that. I knew we'd get you outta there. You saved my life. So we're even. So, how's it feel to be back among the living? It feels great. This is Andrea. We met. What do you guys doing here? We're gonna shut Crowley down. How? Virus. We unleash it in Crowley's system and blow it. Game time's over. It's pretty optimistic. Crowley's got to have antivirus programs. Listen man, there's no line of code this monkey boy's gonna write that can't bitch fuck. I hope you're right. What's this? Souvenir. Do you mind? Knock yourself out. What's in that thing anyway? That's a supple multi-pin connector. Seems to tap into a bundle of nerves in the brainstem here. There's a PROM chip in there. PROM stands for... I know. Programmable read only memory. Yeah. PROM chip contains the interface that allows you to communicate with Crowley's computer. Criminal alarm. What's up? We got maybe nothing, maybe we're under attack. Attack? By who? By a criminal. Unknown. My thermal sensors are going crazy. I'm getting all sorts of encrypted voice chat on the scanners. All right, people, you know the drill. Get to your posts. Get topside, see if you can help. Tron, compress that virus to flop. - Let's go! - Move out! - Move! - Move out! What are you guys doing? They're right at us at the door. Shh, get down. They're getting position to attack. I have this under control. I'm not going down without a fight. Stu, stand by. My eyes! Take your goggles off! They're coming out like a fucking woodwork! What's the fucking wrong? Hold your position! Just hold your position! I can't hold them off! Compression will two minutes. Have a nice day. They're everywhere! They're everywhere, guys! More! More more coming! They're coming from everywhere! Jesus Christ! Dammit! Assault. txt deleted. Airboss.doc. Bigjuicy. wad deleted. I'm hit! Goddammit, I've been hit! My god, where are they coming from? We're never gonna last. There's too many of them. Tron, we're fucked. Do it. The self-destruct sequence has been initiated. If this is a mistake, press Control + C now. System has been armed. Have a nice day. Everybody get outta here! Go! Okay, kitties, duck and cover. Now what? We're fucked. No, I don't buy that. You saved the virus, right? Sure, but how do we infect his computer if we blown up all our hacking equipment? Me, typhoid fucking Mary. Of course, it's so simple. We got trouble. Let's move. Okay, she wolf, buy us some time. This may hurt. Do it! How does this work? I crafted the virus to the driver program in his PROM chip. That way, if Crowley puts him in the game, it'll affect his entire system immediately. Bitestrokeme. now, downloaded. Have a nice day. You guys beat it. What do you mean? I'm going back. You're not going alone. Stu, go. No, not this time. Let's do it. Listen up, hero boys. The second that system starts to go down, you get the hell outta dodge. Why? We worked the subroutine into the virus. It'll overload Crowley's generators. 15 minutes, the whole place goes up. You guys don't mess around, do you? Fuck with the best. Die like the rest. We gotta out here a bit. Who's left? I don't know. Sweep for survivors. Take them to the safe house, go! I'll handle this, go. Drop your weapons. Drop them! Don't move! Don't you fucking move! You come with us, scumbag. Let's go! Very pretty. So what were you guys up to? Because I know this isn't over. I know there's more of you guys out there. So what's the plan? We're gonna shut you down. Could you be a little more specific? I know all about you. You used to be the star of Crowley's rape program. You and papa had shared some intimate moments. He's going to be so thrilled when he finds out that you're back. But you're much too delicious to torture. At least, physically. Last chance. Well, papa's too busy to attend to you right now. But we have of your sessions saved of flopticle. What do you say we give one of them a spin? Here's to old friends. I don't blame you for your attempt. Do you really think you could've escaped? We'll soon see how good you are then. It's the Prime Time Games Grudge Match! With champion hunter, Heinz Dietrich! Versus the convict who just won't die. Will Singleton! You suck it, boy! And for his first appearance, former rebel leader, Stu Lewis! Go down you traitor bastard! Easy there, partner. How do I work this thing? Grab the stick. Look for the horizon and level off. Okay, okay. Look for the rudder pedals. They're at your feet. Easy ease. Jam on both pedals. Straight now. Looking good. Hey, I got it. I got it. Cool. Will, um, we got bad guys. Must be Dietrich. All right, we got him then. Two against one. Don't get cocky. That's a MiG-29 Fulcrum. It's not only faster, it's got bigger missiles. Yeah, well, you know what they say about missile size. Shit, Will, here's what we do. Lit my afterburners. I'm on my way. Nice move. Beginner's luck. Beginner's luck, fuck you. Stu, I don't see him. Fuck, Stu, I need some help. He's on my ass. I can't see him, Stu, I can't. We've got tone. He's locked, he's locked. Once again, Singleton. I have you right where I want you. I'll see you later, Stu. Sooner that you think, buddy! See ya! Simultaneous death. No winner. Cheaters! Motherfucking cheaters! We want a rematch! Charge! What's going on? What did you do to attack the program? Virus. We put the PROM chips in my skull. As soon as you pull me in the game, your program was fucked. I'll kill you myself. Programming, status! It's a virus, sir. It's in the mainframe. It's sweeping everything up. Can you stop it? Sweet Jesus, it's all going down. Draw, Parker! Stop this! Knight, prepare for battle. Freedom, freedom! Malfunction. Malfunction. Automatic shutdown initiated. System boot. Malfunction. Malfunction. Danger, danger. Generator overload. Alert, alert. Little son of a bitch. Well done. Up in a puff of smoke. Well, goodbye. Goodbye. If papa could see you now. He'd be so proud of you. You know, Heinz, in some companies give a gold watch, a new car, a nice Christmas bonus. But this latest failure of yours deserve the most special reward. Watch. Hillary. Hillary. You loved her, didn't you, Heinz? Somewhere in that black and twisted heart of yours, a spark of love stubbornly burn for your daughter. She's all I have. You have nothing left, Heinz. Nothing. Hillary! Hillary! That's it clown. Dance for me. Poor little clown. Back to your posts! Deserters! Silence! I thought you. Will. Okay, let's go get the prisoners and get outta here. No, I'm getting Dietrich. No, I'm getting Crowley first. I'll get the prisoners. Prepare my helicopter. And evacuate the building. It's about to explode. In a puff of smoke. Run! Better run! You killed Hillary. You can could say hi to her in hell when I'm finished with you. You silly little girl. You would never get caught. You sick pathetic bastard. You're going down. I'll kill you myself. Come on, you guys. It's Independence Day. You little tart, I won't give you the satisfaction. Game's over. What a disappointment. Run! Run! Everybody out! Everybody out! Move it! Electrical repair, create report to section 12. Keep moving! Shut up and run! Everybody out! Everybody out now! Hazardous materials obtained. Report to section four. Water control, report to level eight. You bastard. This place is gonna blow. There are prisoners on this level. I'm gonna free them. You don't have much time. You better go. Emergency over. Emergency over. Malfunction. Malfunction. Shutdown. Emergency. Emergency. Malfunction. Malfunction. Hunter, prepare for virtual insertion. Heinz Dietrich, report to game facility. - Virtual reality. - Let's go, let's go. - Move it! - Simulation. Go! - Quickly! - To commence. - In 10. - Up on your feet, kid. - Let's go, come on. - Nine. Eight, seven. - Let's go, hurry up. - Six. Five. Blow! It's gonna blow! Processing prisoner transfer. Have a good game. Crowley. Take me out. Crowley! Take me out! Now! Crowley! Take me out NOW!
