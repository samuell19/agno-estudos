He's doing the short set. Two Encores. Maybe 12:15. Yeah, I have got to go. Mr. Frank Sinatra, ladies and gentlemen! Give me a cigarette! Yeah, you look... Match me. There you go! What? I'm sorry Frank. There you go, Mister Sinatra! Thanks, doll. You know the basic difference between men and women? Women will ask for directions and men won't. If you're with your man tonight, ladies, and you get lost on the way home... before he'll ask for directions, you'll end up on Gilligan's Island. Remember that show "Star Trek," all those guys in the spaceship? "To go boldly where no man has ever gone." They were lost. Have a great show, Mr. Sinatra. One thing you need to know about men: Men are exactly like tile. If you lay them right the first time, you can walk all over them the rest of your life. Hank, give me a splash of bourbon. Give me a bourbon. Here's some Mr. Jack for Mr. S. There you are, Sir. Here. Cancel that. I want some hot tea. Yeah, you don't want, Hot tea. Get him some tea, come on. Tea, tea, tea. No, cancel that. Give me the bourbon. Give him the bourbon. Here, forget the tea. Here's your bourbon, Frank. Come here, you little prick. Let me teach you something about show business. - Mister Sinatra? - I miss my guys. - I miss my guys. - Ladies and gentlemen, my good friend... and the chairman of the board, Mr. Frank Sinatra!

Let's go to press. News flash. If you doubted Dean Martin can make it without Jerry, cast that doubt aside. Besides Martin's hit songs and sold-out concert appearances... his performance in "The Young Lions," as the happy-go-lucky dame chaser... should do for him what "From Here to Eternity" did for his pal... perennial bad boy, Francis Albert. With his top-ten hit, "Memories Are Made of This"... and number one smash, "Volare"... it's safe to say Dino's a talent here to stay. Whoa, Nelly. How did you all get in my room? Dean, miss Jerry? That question's so old, it's biblical, pal. Here comes Dino. Let him run to $20,000 and tell him to call home immediately. Hey Charlie, mind if I take a whack? Gather around, everybody. Well, what do you know? A drink. For me'? So, feeling lucky? You'll excuse me while we share a private moment here. Hit me. Twenty-six. A winner. My table. New rules, doll. Excuse me, excuse me. Sorry to disturb you, Mr Martin. But Mr. Sinatra is on the phone. Il Padrone himself. Well, you tell him I'm busy. He says it's urgent. Frank was born urgent, pal. You'll all excuse me. Nature calls. Hey Dago! Is that you? What is it? Dino, where have you been? We've been looking all over for you. Say hello to Momo and Hank. Hey, what! Am I invisible? Is that that other skinny Jew? Where have you been? Joey, fellas. Good, how you doing, Dino? Listen, Momo, I'm spreading some of your wealth around here tonight. Hey, zip it, cafone. What, do you think we're on a golf course? Hey Dean, did you get that script that I sent you? Oh uh, you mean "Hamlet"? You know I don't look good in tights, Frank. No, you idiot! "Some Came Running." Don't make me spend three months in Indiana by my lonesome, alright. Listen, Dickie Bird... my character's a card shark with a taste for booze and broads. That might be too much of a stretch. Hey uh, Frank, no part for a brilliant comic who never knows when to shut up? Shut up. All right, all right. Sorry. Look, I'm not doing this without you. That's all there is to it. No listen to me. I sent the wings for you tonight. We're gonna be catching Sammy's midnight show at Ciro's. Well, You send it back Dag. I'm busy. I've got a nice piece of braciole right here. Besides, I've got my own show tomorrow night. How can Sammy dance with one eye anyway? Doesn't that mess with your whatchamacallit? It's your equilibrium. Get me a splash of bourbon. Yeah, sure Frank Yeah. You know what. Cancel that, cancel that. Forget the bourbon. Listen, Dean, I got it all planned out. You take the plane. We'll catch Sammy's show, we'll grab some ring-a-ding... we'll take the chopper to the Springs for a midmorning clam bake... and I'll have you back at the Oasis by show time. It will be a gas! Listen, Charlie, you are the Eisenhower of the night... but you gonna have to storm the beaches without me this time. Now, you give my love to the merry Negro. And to Momo and Hank I'll see you later, fellas. [SPEAKS ITALIAN] See you later, Dino. Can you believe him? He's the only guy in the world who could say no to me... And I gotta tell your. I still love him. Hey, hey, hey. I can say no to you. I know, but I don't love you when you do. But I still love you. Come on, let's get out of here. Bishop, you got a watch? Yeah, but I was on New York time. ♫ One thing leads to another. ♫ ♫ Too late to run for cover. ♫ ♫ She's much too close for comfort now. ♫ ♫ Too much. Oh! ♫ ♫ Too much, too close for comfort, now. ♫ Yeah! All right. Thank you. Thank you. Wow. Huh! It is great to be back. It's great to be back! Umm... There was a time, about four years ago... after the accident, that I thought... I might never perform for you again. But the old man upstairs... I guess wasn't through with me yet... and I... Thank you, thank you! And, and there are some people who I... I simply have to thank. People without whose support I... I would have curled up and died, baby. There is Eddie Cantor... the man who gave me my Star of David. The only night I haven't worn it in five years, was the night of the accident. Eddie Cantor, Eddie Cantor, ladies and gentlemen. I love you, Sammy. Thank you, Eddie. Thank you man, from the bottom. I mean that from the bottom. And last, but never least... a man who gave my pop and my uncle and I... our first break a dozen or so years ago. A man who got me gigs at clubs that wouldn't have me in the audience... until he got me a table there too. A man who picked me up when I was so very, very down. My leader... More importantly, my friend. Mister Frank Sinatra. I'm over here, Frank. Rank, I'm over here. Sammy, let me ask you this: How's your bird? It was my eye Frank. It was my left eye. Oh! Left eye. Sorry. Thank God for that Sammy. Because, eyes you know. We got two of them. Yeah. But when your bird can't fly, you're Earthbound, baby. Welcome back. Sammy Davis Jr., ladies and gentlemen. Frank, Frank. Come here, buddy. Mr. Davis. Mr. Davis! Sorry to disturb you, but uh... Frank thought you might like a little breakfast. Look, George, I don't want to be uh... Charlie-Ungrateful here or anything but how about just a piece of rye toast? Burnt. Ya know? All right! And George. Stop calling me Mr. Davis. All right, baby? All right. Mr. Baby. And, here on the second day of 1960... Senator John Fitzgerald Kennedy has thrown his hat into the ring... for the Democratic presidential nomination. Momo up yet? Not yet. Wait. Come here, George. Over here. Senator, do you think it's really possible for a Catholic Harvard man with a New England accent... to win in the South? No, But whomever he is, I wish the poor fellow luck. Apropos of that... I just received this wire from my generous father Bobby? It reads as follows: "Dear Jack." "Don't buy a single vote more than is necessary." "I'll be damned if I'm going to pay for a landslide." Yeah, you see? You see. Now that's a big leaguer, George. That's a big leaguer. He knows exactly what everyone's thinking, and what does he do? He walks right into the lion's mouth, and he pulls up a chair. That's guts, baby. That's is guts! Man, he's a playboy. So what? So are you What does that have to do with anything? But, I ain't running for President. Oh, Frank, em. Rocky Cooper called. "The Crumb" is definitely coming to her party on the 17th... So I told her you would decline the invite as usual. Is he bringing his new bride? Mrs. Patricia Kennedy Lawford. I do believe she mentioned that as the main reason she couldn't say no to the "The Crumb." Call her back George. Tell her I'm coming. Whatever you say. George... Tell her I want to sit next to "Mrs. Crumb." That ought to be something to see. Thank you all very much. We'll see you again. Yep. Hello, bad boys. Rocky. There she is. I thought you'd never get here. - How are you, doll? - How are ya? I brought my caddy. I thought we'd play a few holes in your backyard. Oh uh, what do you want to drinking? Uh. Bourbon and coke. Bourbon and water. I don't mix my drinks political parties or races. Right Sammy? Yes, boss. Oh, you are so rough and gruff. I love that about you. You do, do you? You're beautiful. Is Dean coming? Oh you know he said he wanted to stay home with the family, watch a western. You know Dean. Nobody knows Dean, Doll. You said a mouthful. Who. who is that? Who? That. The blond with the eyes and the shape and the... Oh. Yum! That's May Britt. She was the girl in "The Young Lions" with Dean. Hmm... But, umm... I don't think she's fast enough for you, Sammy. Well, I'll limp, sweetheart. Is she single? Oh, she's single. But I warn you she turns down everybody. Including Dean. Yes well, watch my smoke, Sweetheart. All right, I'm watching. Smokey! Yeah? Think taller. Oh, good tip baby. Nick! How have you been? Rocky! Rocky. Where's "The Crumb"? I don't see "The Crumb". Oh, his TV show is shooting late. And stop calling him "The Crumb." Peter's very charming, and he's a Democrat too. Is that sister Kennedy? Mrs. Peter Lawford. How I've wanted to meet you, Frank. It's a pleasure, sweetheart. Oh, my God, he called me sweetheart. Wait till I tell Jack. Shall we have a seat? Thank you. Rocky? Excuse me, Miss Britt... Tell me. Tell you? Well, you're beautiful. I'll tell you that much. My name is Sammy... Sammy Davis, Jr. I know. I saw your Broadway show, "Mr. Wonderful." It was the most amazing thing I ever see. Is that right, "see"? No, actually, it's saw. Ah yes, I get my tensions confused. Oh, that's all right. I get tense too from time to time, baby. Do you call everybody baby? Well, It's easier than remembering all these cuckoo names. My name is May. It's spelled "May," but it's pronounced "My." Can you remember that? Yes. Every time I see you, I'll think, "My, oh, my." Jack's your biggest fan, you know. He loves all those... What do you call it? Those... Oh, your "Frankenslang." That's it. What is that anyway? All those delicious words you use? It's just a way of saying what you want to say... when you don't want the stiffs who run things to know what you're saying. That's all. It's just a way of being naughty. No. No wonder Jack said you're the one man... in the world he'd like to trade places with. [Whispers] Excuse me. Really? Hmm. Huh? Well. Nice to see you again. Peter, Darling, you made it. Darling, I'm so sorry... So sorry I'm late. There's this rather bad actress at the studio. She keeps forgetting her lines. Hello, Darling. And you know. So they keep on... Oh my God! How could you do this? This is... That's Frank. He's sitting there with my wife. Now, just take it easy. Think he's nervous? Come on. Everybody knows about you, Frank and Ava. It's old news. What do you mean, everyone knows? There's nothing for anyone to know. Which is why nobody knows anything. They know nothing. The studio set up a dinner, and a photo was taken, and that's it. That's it. Peter, just pull yourself together. No, I can't do this. The last time I spoke with Frank, he threatened to have my legs broken. He's in with those you-know-who. He's a madman. He's a madman! But, that was years ago. Frank, I mean, has matured. He was carrying Ava's baggage then. And he was nearly suicidal. Yeah! "Nearly"? Well, they weren't serious attempts. Miss, shall I recount the gory details? Oh no, please don't! Because they were gory! Please don't! Hello, old chap. Hi! How are you? Peter, how you doing? Nice to see you, Darling. Hello, sweetheart. Guess who I've been talking to? Yeah. I don't speak to your old man, you know. Yes, I know. He's very scared of you. But that's changed since I married him. I've transformed him. Into what? Into a Kennedy, of course. Nah, hah, hah, hah, hah! I wouldn't leave this woman alone too often. Peter. She's got a way with words. She certainly does, Frank. I think we should go have a talk. Sure. Excuse me. Won't you Pat? Of course. Rocky? Of course. Excuse us, Darling. After you, Frank. Please, I insist. Peter... Sure. What is it about that man? Oh, you want to fuck him. You want to mother him. You... Don't want to piss him off! Oh God, is it a combination? You know, when I first met Joe Kennedy... He told me that I possess the two qualities that he most despised in a man. I'm an actor... And I'm, I'm English. Well, you obviously charmed him, Cyril. Ooh, not really. You know. He hired a spy who told him that... I had this certain penchant for ladies, young ladies that come for... How should I put it? A price? Yeah, a very reasonable price, Frank. I'm sure. You always were tight, Cyril. So what happened? Well, he was so overjoyed that I wasn't a Poof that he welcomed me whole heartedly into the family. Which has its perks, apart from their predisposition to die in tragic circumstances. Sins of the father, no doubt. I want to help Jack get elected. Lest we wind up with another stuffed shirt. This country needs some shaking up. And I don't mean by Elvis. Is that why you're talking to me? Pete, don't be so insecure, okay? I've always liked you. You just crossed me. That time with Ava... It wasn't a date, Frank. I swear to God, it was just... Nah, don't bring God into it. He's disappointed in both of us. I'm an 18-carat manic depressive. You know that. I overreacted, a little. I do miss her, though. The insanity. All of it, believe it or not. I just can't seem to let go. Maybe because you can't let go of what you never really had, huh Cyril? Yeah. So you want to have some fun? Yeah. Help me put your brother-in-law in the White House. I mean. What else is there for a skinny wop like me to accomplish in this world, huh? I can't think of anything, Frank. ♫ Everyone is voting for Jack. ♫ ♫ Cause he's got what all the rest lack. ♫ ♫ Everyone wants to back Jack ♫ ♫ Jack is on the right track. ♫ ♫ 'Cause he's got high hopes ♫ ♫ He's got high hopes. ♫ ♫ Nineteen, Sixty's the year. ♫ ♫ For his high hopes. ♫ ♫ Come on and vote for Kennedy. ♫ ♫ Vote for Kennedy! ♫ ♫ And we'll come out on top. ♫ ♫ Oops, there goes the opposition, Kerplop. ♫ ♫ Oops, there goes the opposition, Kerplop. ♫ ♫ Whoops, there goes the opposition, Kerplop. ♫ ♫ K-E "double N" E-D-Y ♫ ♫ Jack's the nation's favorite guy. ♫ ♫ Everyone wants to back, Jack! ♫ ♫ Jack is on the right track. ♫ ♫ 'Cause he's got high hopes ♫ ♫ He's got high hopes ♫ ♫ Nineteen, Sixty's the year. ♫ ♫ For his, high hopes. ♫ ♫ Come on and vote for Kennedy. ♫ ♫ Vote for Kennedy. ♫ ♫ Keep America strong. ♫ ♫ Kennedy.

Good night, all. Get back here, Dean. Get right back here! Look. There's a reason why we're all here tonite. You threatened us. Did he threaten you too, Sammy? Um, I refuse to answer that on the grounds that it might incinerate me, baby. Don't you mean "incriminate" you? Oh Baby! Once you've been incinerated... you don't care if you gets incriminated. Do you see why I want to get into politics? I can't have a serious conversation with these two bums. Seriously, folks, we're gathered here tonight... to raise money for a man that I met briefly... when I sang at the Democratic convention in 1956. He gave a speech that night. And, let me tell you something. When you hear Jack Kennedy speak. You don't forget it. So I don't have to say too much about why I think he should be the next President of the United States. He can take care of that just fine. Thank you very much! It's an honor for me to introduce to you... the senator from the great state of Massachusetts... John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Jack, come on up here. Jack Kennedy, everybody! Thank you. And a special thanks to you Frank, for arranging this. It's an honor to be on the same stage with you. With all of you. Good evening! My name is John Kennedy. Jackie Bouvier's husband. Unfortunately, she couldn't be here tonight... But I want to be sure that I uh... Get all your autographs. So I can prove that I was really here. Ladies and gentlemen... we live in extraordinary times. Times of great promise and great peril. In Chinese, the word "crisis" is composed of two characters. One represents danger. The other opportunity. Look at him. He's got them in the palm of his hands. I love this guy. Take a peek at Marilyn, Pally! She gets any more humid, we're all gonna need umbrellas. Look at DiMaggio. Lifetime "325" Center Fielder for the Yankees... and now he's Charlie-Ball-Boy. Different league, buster. Different league. A world full of problems calls for greater leadership and vision in the control of nuclear weapons. The utter destruction! Which would result from their use in war... Are the real issues that face us today. I'm the one trying to stay on the up-and-up here. What about when you got hit with the pie? The fella says what's the point of power if you don't abuse people? You know that one. I remember that. I remember that. I was in the bathroom. He gets it right in the eye. He can't see it. He can't see it. Do you serve uh... Southern Italian food at your place, Joe? Sure. When they would say "four balls" Joe would think they were talking about meatballs, usually. But if it's Northern Italian food that you're interested in Jack... You have to go north. San Francisco. One of the little ironies of living in L.A. I feel a punch line coming. Why is that, Dean? Because Frank has outlawed it. No, that's not true. I'm not sure that's proper use of your power, Frank. I think we'll have to get my brother here to ah, launch an investigation. Shalom! What do you say, Bobby? Well, uh. Seeing as how I share... Frank's passion for Southern Italian food... I, I ah... See no need to authorize an investigation at this time. Dodged a bullet. Cheers! All right brother Bobby. Let's hear it for brother Bobby! I'll drink to that! He'll drink to anything. Watch this, Jack. If you... Now if Momo would show up, we'd have a full house. Hey Buddy Boy! Politicians, movie stars, mobsters. Untouchables. All the bacteria you need for life itself. Well. Look who we have here. Hey, Mickey! I see you cleaned Bugsy's blood off your shirt. Is that a Cuban cigar in your hand by any chance? Mickey Cohen. And Johnny Roselli. Well, well! Where Johnny is, can Momo be far behind? I'll tell you what to do with it. What is this, Tony? It's a private party, Tony. Turn around and look at the man. No, please. Right this way. I love the bubbles. Thank you, everyone! But I'm afraid we're expected somewhere else. We are? Yeah. We have that thing. Remember? Well... I'm not leaving. I'm having fun. Don't contradict me in front of everybody. Let's just go. Are you still my husband? I thought I had a new one. What's his name? You know, the one who wrote "Death of a Mailman." You know. I think it's about time I... rolled on out of here myself. Married life. You know what I'm talking about, Fellas. Why it's uh... It's fairly late in the game for me too. Well, by the way Joe, listen. Why don't you uh... Explain to me about that infield fly rule. I never could quite understand that. Listen, don't embarrass yourself, Chump. Let Frank handle it, okay? I'll get the car. Sweetheart, you should leave with Joe. You're gonna regret it tomorrow if you don't. He isn't my husband anymore. He's just a fuddy-duddy. I know, but he's an Italian fuddy-duddy. And you're making him lose face, Sweetheart. Come on. Okay? You're right, Frankie. Thanks. Jack I'm sorry for the embarrassment. Marilyn, please. Don't even think about it. It was a pleasure. You too, Bobby. Bye! Sammy. All right! Here you go, sweetheart. Thanks! Good night. Bye. I don't want to be Charlie-Trembles here... But uh, why don't you go out ahead of me? There may be photographers out there. I don't care. Shhhh! Your studio does mind, all right? Dean will take you home and then I'll swing by your place a little later. Huh? My God. Would you look at that. These guys can screw anybody. Anybody they want. Make sure you give him my number, will you Peter? Of course I will. Thank you! You promise? Greatest ass, in the history of the world. It's laid out for them on a plate. Like a deli spread. Good night, Joe. Take care. Hi. Judy Campbell. I'm here to see Frank. Hello Chickie baby! It's just you, me and the girl scouts. Your place or mine? We'll go to my place. You can have the presidential suite. How's that? They're not just gonna hand me the keys to the White House, Frank. If I want to get to Nixon... I have to step over Humphrey first. Jack, let me tell you something! No one named Hubert will ever be president. It's like in the movies. Except you're going up for the part of president. Now, having done a couple of movies myself, I can tell you that Edward G. Robinson doesn't play Gary Cooper parts. He plays Edward G. Robinson parts. He plays the bad guy, he's the shady guy. See, he doesn't play the hero. You're going to be going toe-to-toe... with Richard Nixon for the romantic lead in a movie called "Presidential Politics." Who do you think will get the girl? Huh? Right here. Speaking of which... Which one do you want? Or do you want both of them? I know him well. Really well. Who's the one who looks like Elizabeth Taylor? Yeah! I had a feeling. That's Judy Campbell. She looks like Elizabeth Taylor, only better. You don't have to marry her to sleep with her. Life is good. Hello? What, Bobby? What's wrong? It's 5:00 A.M. I'm just uh... I'm getting up. Wait a minute. Bobby? Can I call you back, Bobby? I ah... Well, it's Marilyn. She came over at about 3:00 this morning... in a state that... hang on! Can only be described as shaky. And uh... I've been up all night, you see. Yeah, she's quite a handful. Uh hmm! No! No I haven't slept with her. But I do hear that she's overrated. What? Hoodlums? Oh, Mickey Cohen? Uh, yeah. Yeah but, Puccini's. Uh-huh. So what? It's a restaurant Bobby! Frank doesn't control whoever goes to... I...Yeah, well. I'll do anything for the family, Bobby. You know that! But I can't just go... Ah, yeah! All right, I'll see what I can do then, Bobby. Fucking Kennedys! Yeah, exactly! No, no, no, no, no! I got you down for 10 thousand dollars. Jeanne, what do you mean five? Hey uh. You said $10,000, Jeanne. Don't! Don't! Don't give me that Catholic crap, alright. Any other candidate. Yes, I would agree... But, Kennedy is rewriting the rule books. Jeanne I'm telling you. Good morning, George. Good morning Miss Campbell. Hold on. Morning, Judy! Good morning! Is he up yet? Oh, he's up, all right. Jeanne, all right look! I'm putting you down for $10,000. I want you to make the check out to... the Kennedy Campaign. Yes, yeah!. I promise you a front row seat at the inauguration. How's that? Okay, Thanks! Good morning! Good morning Cyril! How's your bird? Gentlemen, the bird has flown! We should go up to Sun Valley Frank. Go skiing. Jack, just had a little chat... with you-know-who this morning. And... Pat's out of town next month. Thought we might uh... have a little clam bake at the beach. Can you make the campaign stop? Well, what about the center fielder? Ah! Is he coming out of retirement? It looked like he was. He dropped the ball. Well then. Let's circle the bases. There you go. Good idea! Wait, wait, wait! George. Are you hungry, Jack? You know... Get Jack the house special. Oh, and George! And tell him how you feel about civil rights. He's gonna be president. He should know. It doesn't matter what I think. Why is that, George? Because... It doesn't matter what the Negro thinks in this country. I mean, the few who do vote are all tied up with those Democratic machines in the north. Hell, they'd vote for Adolf Hitler in Chicago... if Mayor Daley told them to. And senator, no politician can win in the south if he offends old Jim Crow. Even if he did. The Negro still can't vote down there anyway, can he? You may be right, George. I'll be sure to share your feelings... with Martin Luther King next time I see him. If you get in office, Senator... you won't have to ask him. He'll tell you. Thanks George! Hello, Frank. Ready for lunch? Yeah. Look at this. Whoo! Whoo! A little business. Not that I want to impose on our relationship in any way. But I um... Is it any good? What's that? Your script, Cyril. It's wonderful! The script's wonderful Frank. I bought the rights from a friend of mine and... Just happens to be a part for you. You know I can't. Uh... I can't get arrested in features these days Frank. But there's a devilishly good part for you in it. And for Dean too, and Sammy even, if the studio doesn't mind. I am the studio, Cyril. You certainly are the studio, Frank. What's it called? It's called "Ocean's Eleven." Lousy title, but leave it. I'll read it. Yeah, it's a lousy title. But you'll read it? Yeah. Thanks! You know, I really appreciate this. You know, I think it's wonderful that... Knock it off. Right. I owe you, Peter. You're doing me a favor, and I appreciate it. You're giving me a chance to change my image. Yeah, wait till the God Damn press sees me in the White House with the president. That will shut those Son's of Bitches up. Right. Um, speaking of your image. Just that Bobby mentioned that... he saw Mickey Cohen eating at Puccini's. So? Is there any law against eating spaghetti? Exactly what I said. But he... He mentioned it. Don't squirm Peter. I hate it when you squirm. Thank you. Yeah. Right. Jack uh, you know. I mean it's just... Jack is just so vulnerable to... Hoover. Who hates the Kennedys with a passion. Bordering on... I never apologize for my friends. Not even you. Thank you. Thank you. When I was flat on my ass a few years ago... guys like Johnny and Momo were the only ones who would give me a job. And believe me... I wasn't packing them in back then. Absolutely. Open your eyes Peter. Jack's a bootlegger's son who likes to fuck them two at a time. If that fruitcake in the F.B.l. wanted to do something, he'd have done it by now. Don't you think? Right. Well? Oh yes, and before I forget... Eh, Bobby also mentioned, He mentioned that you were going to hire a writer called Albert Maltz...to write a script for you. Yes, I'm hiring Albert Maltz. So what? He's a great screenwriter But he's a Communist. Isn't he blacklisted? Albert Maltz is just a screenwriter. That's it. He thought the country was giving the working man a raw deal 30 years ago. Who didn't? So did Ronald Reagan. Kirk Douglas is using Trumbo for "Spartacus." If he can do it. You don't think I can Peter. Uh yeah. Kirk Douglas isn't a presidential candidate's friend. He's not Jack Kennedy's friend. You see... You get my drift? Stand up, Peter! Why? I said stand up. Right. How tall are you? Six foot two. Don't cut yourself off at the knees. The brouhaha over Sinatra's hiring of blacklisted screen writer Albert Maltz to write the film vehicle of "The Execution of Private Slovik" escalated today as actor John Wayne spoke out against Sinatra. Wayne said, I quote "I wonder how Sinatra's crony, Senator John Kennedy, feels about him hiring such a man." "I'd like to know his attitude because he's the one that was making plans to run the government of our great country.” I got some things in the trunk. Brian, if you would, please. Ambassador Kennedy's in the study. Great. Sinatra bought full-page ads in the trades which state quote " I do not ask the senator for advice on whom I should hire, and he doesn't ask me how he should vote in the Senate." I hire the best man for the job, and I am prepared to await the verdict of the American people when they see the picture. ”Well, there he is. Had a nice ride? It was perfect, Ambassador. Thank you. I brought you some fresh Italian bread and some other delectables. Marvelous. Jack Daniels still your drink? You've done your homework. Yes, Sir. Jack Daniels for Mr. Sinatra. I understand you and Jack have been having a nice time together. Oh, we've had a few laughs. How much have you heard? Enough. [Frank laughs nervously] Frank! Yes, Sir. About this Maltz fellow... I'm too old to beat around the bush... So I'll come right out with it. I admire your courage, but if you don't fire him I'm afraid you can't continue to associate yourself with the campaign. It's bad enough Jack gets banged around for being a Catholic. He can't be pro-Communist too. Ambassador, Albert Maltz is not a Communist. He's a screenwriter. He's a Jew who sits in front of typewriter all day and doesn't get enough sun. That's it. He's history. I already made a commitment to him. You made a mistake. The bigger the man, the bigger the mistake. That's all. Just pay him off and do what you have to do to save face. But do it! Marilyn Monroe could have sex with every opinion maker in the country, and it wouldn't make a difference if they think Jack is soft on Commies. I understand. Now, there's another matter. I need a favor. I thought you just asked for one. Well, that was a favor to you. This one's for me. We need Humphrey out of the race and the only way to do that is to smash him in the West Virginia. Jack won Wisconsin. But he was waxed in all four Protestant districts Know much about West Virginia, Frank? Coal miners and canaries. That's all I know. And Protestants, Frank. Millions of them. Ninety-five percent. We lose there, and our opponents in both parties will say a Catholic can't win the south, and Jack won't get the nomination. But it's critically important for Jack to get the support of the state's political machine. The Teamsters will never endorse Jack. Not after Bobby's witch-hunts. They won't. Perhaps not publicly, no. Are we on the same wavelength? I'm a saloon singer, but I'm not stupid. Let me get this straight, what you're saying is you know Jack can't win West Virginia. And, you want me to go to my friends and make sure he does. Right? They must realize there's no direct quid pro quo. Jack can't be beholden to these people. It will have to be a favor they do for you. And, to an extent, for me. I got it. Just get in the car and drive. News flash. Finally bowing to pressure from within and without Hollywood, Frank Sinatra instructed his attorneys to pay writer Albert Maltz in full, and inform him that he will not write the screenplay, for "The Execution of Private Slovik" after all. When asked, Sinatra said, quote "'I have defended my hiring of Mr. Maltz" but the American public has indicated otherwise. And I will accept this majority opinion. Sinatra issued no other public statement. Have you talked with him? Listen Honey. The reason Frankie and I get along so well, is we try to keep it light. We talk about music, golf, movies. Nice and simple. Well, if you don't talk to Frank, then who do you share your intimate feelings with, Dean? Mind me asking? Jeanne, to share intimate feelings, you have to have intimate feelings. Dinner's almost ready. Save me a seat. How are you, Momo? Don't you ever sleep? No! So? Have you thought about what we talked about on the golf course? I thought about it. Tell me... who's the doll that looks like Elizabeth Taylor? That's Judy Campbell. Judy! This is Sam Flood. This is Judy Campbell. Hi, Sam. She looks like Liz Taylor. But you don't have to marry her to fuck her. You want a drink? Certainly. No ice. I see you're wearing the ring. I always wear the ring. That's not what I heard. I heard you weren't wearing it. You know, I gave you the ring as a symbol of lifelong friendship. Then I heard you weren't wearing it, Momo. Hey! I said I was wearing the ring. What, are you turning homo all of a sudden? Give me a break, for Chrissake. Frankie. Let's get down to it. Tell me, why should I do that Ivy League playboy and his Irish fuck father a favor? Look at it this way, Momo. Okay? You're going to be doing me a favor. You a favor? Yeah. Consider it done. I won't forget it. Oh, neither will I. ♫ Everyone is voting for Jack ♫ ♫ Cause he's got what all the rest lack. ♫ ♫ Everyone wants to back Jack ♫ ♫ Jack is on the right track. ♫ ♫ Cause he's got high hopes. ♫ ♫ He's got high hopes. ♫ ♫ 1960 is the year for his high hopes ♫ This date will go down in the history books of the Democratic Party: July 13, 1960. Senator John Kennedy has received the party's presidential nomination on the first ballot. This makes Kennedy is only the second Catholic candidate in the history of the nation. Party solidarity is high, with the exception of the Mississippi delegation. Which booed Negro entertainer Sammy Davis Jr., as he led the convention in singing the national anthem. Although other voices drowned out the protest... Davis was noticeably shaken. Tony! Hey Frank, how are you? Hey. How you doing? How are you? Everything good? Everything good? Yeah, you too! Our first collaboration, boys. Courtesy of brother-in-Lawford. Ah! Congratulations. Finally contribute something. Well, you old crumpety, you. Listen. We're going to shoot the picture in Vegas by day and we're gonna play the Sands at night. We'll gonna tear up the town. In our spare time, we'll do our part for Jack. Spare time? What spare time? I don't sleep good standing up, Frank. Hey, uh... Um Frank. Is there uh... You know something. Something in this for me? Yeah. You're going to play a singing garbageman Sam. Now, you're spoiling him. No, but seriously, Frank. Is there a part for me? Sam, it's a great part. Don't worry about it. Look at you worrying. You're getting wrinkles. There's a great part, Okay? Alright. Relax. All right. Whatever you say. Sammy, you have got to play this part. There's singing, dancing, a wonderful title song. It's yours, baby. It's yours. Okay. I'm confused here, Frank. You've got a story set in Vegas about oceans... starring a schlemiel who sings about garbage. I'm Ocean, shmendrick. I'm Danny Ocean. Shmendrick. You bums are part of my old commando unit. We're ex-Gi's... Who reunite to knock over some casinos. The plot's a gasser. It's foolproof. I say. Screw the movie. Let's just pull the job. I figure if power doesn't mean that you have the opportunity to work with the people that you love Then you haven't really got any. You're beautiful, Captain. Yeah. Okay Davis! I'll drink to that. All right. If Ike, Khrushchev and DeGaulle can have their summit. Then why can't we? Oh yeah! That's a good comparison. I'll be Khrushchev. Somebody give me a ginger ale or something. What am I, chopped liver? Here's to everybody. We all deserve it. Very good. Time for less thinking and more drinking. Aye, aye. Maybe I should just say "eye." Aye, aye. Here's two for the Jews. Who the fuck is that? Is that who I think it is? The reporter. Yeah, that's the busboy. "Frank Sinatra, Wanna-Be Gangster." That's the guy who wrote it! He called me "Ava's Gardener." No no! That guy's taller. Sammy. I'm telling you, that's him! That's not him. He called me a sniveling mama's boy. That little fucking cocksucker! Wait a minute. Hold it! He meant it in the nicest way. Frank. Hey Bum! What the fuck you doing in my restaurant? It's still a free country. Isn't it Frank? No, it's not! It's a very expensive country. And you'll pay a serious price if you don't scram right now! I paid for my drink. Have him hold the appetizers. Here. Here. Here! Get the Hell away from me, you son of a bitch! Hold it. Hold it! Frank! Come on, Frank Get him out of here! You write that shit about me again. I'll fucking kill you! Get out! Get out! I'm gonna fucking sue you! Get out! Son of a Bitch! You want to take a crack at me, pal? Shut up, Jimmy! Come on, let's go. It's okay. It's okay. I'm sorry, everybody. Tony. Tony. Everybody eats and drinks on the house, all right? Ladies and gentlemen. Direct from the bar at the Sands Hotel... Mr. Dean Martin! How did all these people get in my room? Maestro, how long have I been on? ♫ Hey there ♫ ♫ You with the stars in your eyes ♫ ♫ Love never made a fool of you ♫ ♫ You... ♫ There they are, folks: Tarzan, Jane and the African Queen. I think I'll make myself a little salad. Let me help you out here a little. How about some lunch? Frank. Do you know how to make a fruit cordial? No, Dean. How do you make a fruit cordial? You be nice to him. Do you believe in fairy godmothers? No, but I have an uncle I'm keeping an eye on. Look at these two, ladies and gentlemen. The Italian bookends. Pretty soon they'll be telling you what wonderful work the Mafia has been doing. Hey, hey hey! Have you ever seen a Jew-jitsu? Hey, hey! Now be fair. That's all I ask. How would you like it if I said "Have you ever seen a wop-sicle?" Hey, hey. Hold it! Sorry. Frank is the boss. I'm not really part of this show, folks. I just couldn't get a reservation. Two Italians against one Jew. Sammy, come here. I need your help. Get another Jew up here. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Sammy Davis, Jr. Hurry up, Sam. Your watermelon's getting warm. That's better than eating pizza every night. Yeah. At least we don't have to spit out spit out, spit out, spit out, spit out the crust. That's all, folks. Porky Sinatra. But seriously um, we'd like to start this entertainment off right. I would like to begin by doing a few impressions. And, the first one is of the kingfish. I was down at the Mystic Night Ski Lodge... [Dean Pretends to Speak Foreign Language] If all the women in Texas... were as ugly as your mama... the Lone Ranger gonna be alone for a long time.

I'll even go to a bar mitzvah with you... But don't touch me. What do you think, Jack? Should we grow up? Ladies and gentlemen... the next President of the United States... Senator John F. Kennedy. Take a bow. Jack Kennedy! What was his name again? Senator, we'd like you to accept this award on behalf of the NAACP. Put me down, you nitwit. Hey, boss. Where you been? Hey, I was in the casino giving out your autograph. Good night, Frank. Hey! Did we kill tonight or what? We killed tonight. I haven't heard laughs like that since... Since I played a little club in Poughkipsie. In 1944 Are you saying we weren't funny tonight? What I'm saying is um... Watch this. Excuse me, ladies. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah! Yeah, so? The whole world is drunk. And we're just the cocktail of the moment, Pally. One of these days, everybody's gonna wake up with a heck of a hangover... down two aspirin with a glass of tomato juice... and wonder what the Hell all the fuss was about. See you later, Joey. Time to try out some new jokes. Good night, all. Bluh, bluh! Bluh, bluh! Good night, Dean. That's a good idea. Let's get out of here. It's getting late. You can put your drinks over there. After you, Judy. You leaving, Babe? Dreamland calls, Pally. Thanks for a great evening, Sammy. Good night Smokie! You seen May? Yeah, she's up there. Hey, sweetie, um. Frank and Dean and everybody took off. So why don't we just go ahead and... Why do you let them make fun of you? What? Who? They all make fun of you onstage. [SCOFFS] Come on, baby, that's just a gas. We rib each other. You know that. No, there is "of" and there is "with." Night after night, I study the difference. They make fun "of" you, not "with" you. May you're acting like Charlie-Party-Pooper here. Okay? I'm acting like I love you. I don't know why sometime. All your gold and your flash and your "babies" all the time. I hate it! You're short. You're not good looking. Oh, Gee thanks. But I think you left something out. Right Babe? Like skin color. May! I never even saw your skin color, you idiot! I'm not your friends. Listen... Sometimes Frank and the guys they, They cross the line. Okay, and yes, sometimes it hurts. So I get a little dirt on my uniform. So what! The point is, I'm circling the bases... and the fellas that come up behind me... they are gonna have it easier. Can't you see that? All I see is your heart... and your talent... and your courage. I don't care what our children look like. Brown, white, polka dot. I just want them to have your courage. May, will you, Yes. People will, I don't care a damn. I never have. You don't give a damn.

Nothing, Frank. I just want another for safety. Safety? What, are we jumping out of an airplane? You said action, we did the scene, you said cut. That's it. It's over, finite. Come on, boys, let's take a steam. Oh, we're spritzing. Take us down, Riley Coming down. Relax, Miley, it's only a movie. Well, I guess that was a print. That's it. That's the ticket. Those last four bars... That's how I want it. Yeah, right. Alright, I'll talk to you in a week. - How you doing, Sam? - Pretty good, Skipper. Where's May? She sticking around? - Like glue, daddy. - That a boy. We're getting married, Frank. Sam, they're gonna crucify you. Yeah, I know. Is she up for it? Oh, she says she is. She uh, just wanted to know why I haven't asked her to convert. You know, To become "Yewish." I told her we'd see about that when she learns how to say the "J" sound, Baby. She's a somebody, Sammy. Yes. You're getting married. You're a lucky man. All right. Frank, I don't want to put you on the spot or anything but I was hoping you'd stand up with me. I'd be honored to stand up with you. It would be an honor. Thanks. I just ran into a French reporter. Quite sexy, actually. She asked me, who's in Rat? What did you say? For some pussy? Hey, listen to this, we're getting more press than Elvis these days. And a good thing too, 'cause that Elvis fella sets such a bad example. For the nation's youth. "People in Hollywood refer to Sinatra's gang as the Rat Pack" an offspring of the late Humphrey Bogart's Holmby Hill's Rat Pack whose exclusive ranks, including Mr. Sinatra, of course were dedicated to drinking, carousing, and generally thumbing their noses at conventional morality.” Oh, my. Well, thumb, thumb, thumb. "Some people also refer to Sinatra's pack as the Clan." With Sammy as a member? To be part of the Clan, "You have to be cuckoo." That leaves me out. “You have to be hip in their way of hip.“ Oh, That leaves you out. That definitely leaves you out, Ciro. Yeah, you also have to have talent. And that leaves us all out! "Nonconformity is now the key to social importance in Hollywood." Then it just sort of goes on here. - What? - Nothing. It's just crap, okay Frank. - Read it. - I'm not... Read it! "And that angry middle-aged man, Frank Sinatra," "is its prophet and reigning monarch." "That Senator John Kennedy has associated himself with such childishness..." "perhaps explains why he trails the less hip Richard Nixon in the polls.” - Crap! - Goddamn, give me this thing. What do I have to accomplish for these people to give me some respect? Huh? Greetings, fellow clansmen. You know, looking at you guys naked, I see why God created clothing. Hah, what did I say? Nothing. Sammy Everybody, Sammy's got an announcement to make. Oh, uh. Actually, uh May and I have decided to get married. Goddamn it! A month of this horrendous publicity... and he still doesn't get it. Dad, you'll have a stroke. Calm down. Bad enough we had that Albert Maltz fiasco. Bad enough we have to drag the Pope and all his baggage... down to Dixie with us. Now we have the most prominent, visible members of this campaign... as groom and best man at an interracial marriage! It's not all bad, you know. I mean, The New York, Times "The New York Times" just this morning was saying some very nice things... about Jack not backing away from Frank and... The people in Alabama don't read "The New York Times" Peter. You just grab the first flight to the Springs and you tell Frank, He goes to that wedding, he'll feel like he's standing at the North Pole in his bare feet so far as this family is concerned. Believe me, Dad, I've tried. Oh, Sinatra scares the piss out of you! You know what? Bobby, you call him. My son-in-law is too weak-kneed to stand up to big, bad Frank. Save the white race! Save the white race! Save the white race! Save the white race! "Dear nigger bastard." I see Sinatra is going to be best man at your "abortion.” “It's good to know the kind of people supporting Kennedy before it's too late.” And the idiot misspelled "too" twice. Nazis and death threats right here in Washington, D.C. It's cuckoo, huh Big John. Ah, no no, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What are you doing, boss? Look, I don't want to act like Charley John Wayne but I'm not going to let some crazed idiot jump on that stage without defending myself. You can't go out there I can't go on with these first but have them ready, Big John. Cause I'm gonna move the gun tricks up early in the act and I just won't bother to take them off. Hello. Yeah. All right, hold on. It's Mr. Sinatra for you, boss. Hey Frank! How you holding up, Smokey? Oh, I'm fine Dad. How are you? How about May? I hope she's wrapping up fish in those headlines. Frank, she told me that you called and... You're wonderful, you know that? I mean that. You're very, very special, Frank. It's okay. It's okay. You just hang in there, buster. I'll see you at the wedding. Yeah, about that, I... Smokey, can it. I'll see you soon. Peter's here, Frank. Hey, Cyril. "You will end up in the middle of," "the North Pole without shoes on your feet.” Because of what? Interracial marriage. None of it, whatsoever. He doesn't want any, Peter, just save it, all right? Just save it It's 1960, for Chrissake. Jack has the guts to face the music. I mean, goddamn it! America has to grow up. This is ridiculous! Jack can't face the music from Palm Springs. George! He's the power of the White House. George, where are my cigarettes? Here. George! - What? - Frank, it's Sammy. Well wouldn't you know? My rabbi just called. And uh, he has a bar mitzvah booked that day. And uh, there seems to be a slight hitch in getting The Escoffier Room for the reception. So, May and I have decided, that, you know we're going to postpone the wedding for a few weeks. We don't know exactly when it will be but, you know, we'll be sure to give you plenty of notice. You're lying, Charlie. I'm just telling a different kind of truth, that's all. Sam, You don't have to do this. You hear me? You don't have to do this Sam. Not your wedding. I'd never ask that. I'd never ask this, Sammy. I know. You happy? Save the white race! Save the white race! Save the white race! Save the white race! Hey, Charlie-Nazis! There's that nigger Jew boy! I figured you crackers couldn't afford a ticket. I Thought I'd bring the show to you. ♫ I've got you. ♫ ♫ Under my skin. ♫ ♫ Got you. ♫ ♫ Deep in the heart of me. ♫ ♫ So deep in my heart. ♫ ♫ That you're really a part of me ♫ ♫ I got you, ooh under my skin ♫ ♫ I'd sacrifice anything come what might. ♫ ♫ For the sake of having you near. ♫ ♫ In spite of that crazy voice that comes in the night ♫ ♫ And repeats and repeats in my ear. ♫ ♫ Don't you know. ♫ ♫ You never can win. ♫ ♫ Use your mentality. ♫ ♫ Wake up to reality. ♫ ♫ But each time I do, just the thought of you. ♫ ♫ Makes me stop before I begin. ♫ ♫ 'Cause I got you.

Three minutes till show time, Mr. Davis. No, I want to... Do you know who this is? This is Frank Sinatra and I want you to put me through to Nixon now! Listen, I know he's staying at the Ambassador, and I want the crumb to concede... so put him through now! Son of a bitch! We did it, Dino. We did it! We're going to the White House. We're going to the White House. Hey Frankie! Jack! Congratulations, Honey. Ava? How are you? Well, I'm sure proud of you. There's too much static. Can you hear me'? It's the most beautiful static I ever heard! Frank, you're breaking up, But I'm coming to L.A. soon, and I'll call you. - You hear me'? - Yeah, I hear you. Call me! But... What do you know? What a night, Dino! What a night, Dean! Here we go. Here we go. Won. Frank! Jack! - Hey, canary. - Hey, Charlie-Tommy-Gun! - It's Momo. - Congratulations. Just tell your pal we turned out the living and raised the dead in Chicago... like it was a Catholic resurrection. Great job! Thank you! Be good, Frank. I love that guy. What a character. Yeah, he's a real teddy bear. So long, Nixon. Frank Sinatra flew into Washington from his brand-new Cal-Neva Casino on the shores of Lake Tahoe to stage the most star studded inaugural gala in the history of the Republic with the conspicuous absence of fellow "Rats" Dean Martin and Sammy Davis. Martin claimed to have a movie commitment even though Lawrence Oliver shut down his Broadway show to attend. Davis, who postponed his marriage to May Britt until after the inaugural, also claimed to have other commitments. Ten days at the Fountain Blue Dino. That's it. Johnny, I wish I could help you. But I'm booked solid for more than a year in advance now. Between the movies and Vegas, shoot my youngest don't even know what I look like no more. You realize that this request comes from Momo, himself? What, I got stupid all of the sudden? Besides, I'm booked in Cal-Neva in October. Ain't that enough? Cal-Neva has nothing to do with Sam. Oh yeah, and Jerry and I are still an act. Frank's always available to Sam. See now, Frank keeps a looser schedule than me. Cause I got to work more since I got seven kids. You got big balls Paison, that's what you got. I'm just a hardworking guy, John. So, what are you two A-holes up to? He's a real (Italian Insult), this one. Yeah, that's why we love him. Oh Shrimp. They look good. Hey! Unh, uh, uh. Those are spoken for. Salut! Salut! The happy relationship between arts and politics which has characterized our long history. I think reached culmination tonight. Here it comes. I know we're all indebted to a great friend... Frank Sinatra. Oh no! You're not playing this again. are you? Hey, Dino! What are you doing? People say bad things about me now... they're gonna be calling the President of the United States a liar. Did you read the script? Oh yeah. "Gunga Din" all over again. Pally. Where do you get that? - Uh hmm. - "Gunga Din"? Oh, by the way, have you heard the news, boys? What's that? Brother Bobby made Attorney General. Hey. Whoo! That's something. I wish I was a Kennedy. When did you hear that? Oh, my dial is tuned, Frank. Nice to hear that a choirboy with a passion for sin will be watching out for us, huh? Fellas, excuse us for a minute, please. Yeah, sure. No problem, Dino. You okay, Frank? Yeah. So Bobby made top cop. It's a surprise... I guess. Hey, we're singers, not soothsayers, huh? Listen, I want to sell you my interest in the Cal-Neva, Frank.. What? What are you talking about? Hidden ownership, Charlie. Plucked a grape from the vine, got a sour taste from a bad seed named Momo. Want to spit it out. Dean, come on. I love you, dago. You can pay me to play there anytime. Bobby's gonna have Momo's Guinea ass in a frying pan. I don't want him to use me for the seasoning. That's never gonna happen. I've got some friends in very high places, or haven't you heard Dino? Dago, you'll excuse me, but you may be il capo de tuti capi in Tinsel Town, but in Washington, you're just a skinny wop from Hoboken. Do you have any idea what they did for Jack? Oh, I have an idea. Everybody has ideas. Well... What's an idea, Frank? It's a weightless electrical charge. It don't stand up in the court of reality... which is where we'll all be tried. President Kennedy's on line two. What? President Kennedy is calling. The President? The President's on line two for me. You see? The the president of what? What's he the president of? The United States. The President of the United States? The President on line two for me. I heard you the first 15 times. You're such a pessimist. Give my love to Jacqueline. Jack, how are you? Mr. Kennedy will you address rumors of widespread voter fraud in Chicago and elsewhere in Illinois? There are those... Frankly, I uh. I believe it's irresponsible for press to be uh... printing baseless rumors and, and uh, innuendo. My brother's President of the United States... because he and others fought hard and, and won. Next. Mr. Kennedy, do you expect to delve into any particular fields when you take over as Attorney General? Uh, yes, there are a number of areas um, where I think action is needed... Such as in the field of organized crime. I think that's a very serious situation that faces this country at the present time. There are a number of steps that can be taken. I can say here today that I will make every effort to apply the full weight of this great office to put in jail hoodlums like Carlos Marcello, Trafficante. Momo Giancana and Santo You dirty bastard! Crime bosses deported from this country. Hug me, hug me. Come here. Uhhhh! You answer that, and I'll leave. I gotta get it. It's line number five. It could be an emergency, Nobody calls on that unless it's important, Ava. Come on. I gotta get this. Hello. It's Roselli. Hey, Johnny, how you doing? I hear Ava's blowing on your dice again. Maybe she likes your new Irish friends. Or maybe she's bored with bullfighters. How'd you hear that? J. Edgar Hoover told me. We're on a first name basis these days. So what are ya gonna have a fuckin conversation? Just wait a minute. Giancana, oh he would have called you himself... but he's having a little trouble swallowing. Because while you're fucking we're gettin fucked! You can fry an egg in the heat we're gettin here. You know how he gets, Frankie. This kind of thing make a lot of people upset. Okay, yeah. There's so many bugs in the walls, we need an exterminator. Wait a minute. Hey Frankie, are you listening to me'? I'm calling on behalf of Momo himself! I'm listening. Sam wanted me to remind you that it was you who came to us. We went out on a line for these fucking Kennedy guys. We did our part. (Whispers) I'm leaving. Otherwise, we'd be seeing Nixon on the front page every day. I'm leaving Frank. Wait. How they got where they are... None of us expected any thanks, Frank. We didn't expect a pinky up our ass either. Now, you tell your new friend, Joe Kennedy, to call off that mongrel son. Put a choke chain on Bobby. You got it? All right, I will. You want me to tell Sam the load is too heavy? - Is that what you want me to tell him? - Go fuck yourself, Frank. Cause, that's what I will. But I don't think it's the right thing to do. Now, you gotta deliver us a little favor Frank. Fuck you, Frank! You gotta tell old man Kennedy to call off the dogs. I will. Okay. All right. Good. Now give Ava a spanking from me. (Scoffs) Ava. Ava, what's your problem? Ava. I don't want to hear it. What? I thought maybe you'd grown up. I thought you were travelin in different circles. You obviously don't know how things work Ava. Because the circles, they intersect. Come on, Frank. I may be a drunken little whore, but at least I don't get into bed... with men who kill people and steal for a living. Into bed? How the Hell am I "into bed"? Frankie, you're the biggest movie star in the goddamn world. But the minute those two-bit thugs call you up... you fucking jump like an errand boy. You don't turn your back on your friends. Aw please. You cheated on your first wife. You cheated on me. What, we weren't your friends? When I was carrying, Come here. When I was carrying your bags like a porter. I never treated you like a porter. When I was carrying your bags like a, Those guys stuck by me! They were the only ones who would help me out! What a load of crap. Are you an artist or are you a thug? You don't know what the fuck you're talkin about! You never know what you're talking about! You never know what you're talking about! Shut up! Ava. Ava, wait a minute. Wait. wait, wait! It's 3:00 in the morning. You can't drive home. How many times have we been through this. Frank? It's pathetic. It's pathetic. You want to talk about pathetic? Huh? You're drinking so much, your skin's starting to feel like sandpaper, Ava. That's pathetic. You are a bastard. Ava. Ava. Ava, Ava! Ava, wait, wait, wait, wait! Ava wait! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, I didn't mean that. Frank. I love it when you sing... because you're honest when you sing. You are an angel when you sing. Why don't you just sing? Hey Frank, how's the president? He needs a vacation. Freddy, give me my drink. Did you read the script? Amusing story about that. I had Jack read it, see. And, he says it's a remake of "Gunga Din." If you don't like your part, Peter we can always find another Englishman. I didn't say that. Didn't say it. When am I coming, Peter? It's been four months. He's making me look bad. Working on that, Frank. It's just a little different these days. That's all How's that? Well, uh. You're still Frank Sinatra. But Jack's president now. With a lot of help from me and my friends. I realize that, but, uh You go to the White House, don't ya Peter? Yeah, but not that often these days... Oops, considering the crisis and everything. But it's family, Frank. And Joe treats you like a son, does he? Don't squirm. I hate it when you squirm. Yeah. Sometimes I'm not so sure, Frank. Is she beautiful? - How you doing? - I'm okay. - No problems? - No problems. Judy, Judy, Judy. Well, what do you know? The hard-on stretches from Palm Springs to the White House... and all the way back here to Chicago. Peter frankly, I'm amazed you think you can walk into the office of the Attorney General's with crap like this. Whatever favors Giancana says he did on behalf of the family, I'm going to act in the best interest of this country, which means ridding the nation, the likes of him, Hoffa, Trafficante and all the rest. This just came from Hoover. Thanks. That's all very well, Bobby. But it's um, like banking, really. Favor banking, you see? You have to look at it from - their point of view. - Jesus! They did us a favor, now they want a favor in return. Listen to me. They may be a bunch of well-dressed nightclub owners with cute nicknames to you, Peter. But the truth is they steal, they murder... they extort and they corrupt. And, I intend to ram the Washington Monument right up their rear ends. Understand? Yeah. Of course, I understand, Bobby. Thanks for your time. The Bay of Pigs continues to haunt the President. With over fifteen hundred men still rotting in a Cuban prison, the war of words between Castro and the United States United States grew even hotter today as Castro lambasted the young president as a naked aggressor. Give me some good news, Peter. Who's Frank sleeping with these days'? Well, Ava came back for about five minutes. I hear she's a formidable woman. Oh, if you only Good morning, Evelyn. Tell Frank we'll have him over soon. Uh, that's good because he's uh. He's been asking about that actually. I'm sure he has. But Jackie doesn't want him in the house. Thinks he's a bad influence. Well maybe we could stuff him into one of John John's diaper bags and smuggle him in, yeah. I think uh, Jackie's out of town next month. We could uh, have him up then. Have Eunice be the hostess. Take him up to Hyannis Port, go for a sail. Yeah, that's good. He'd like that. It's good to see you again, Peter. Oh, Peter. Yes. Say hello to you-know-who. Of course... Mr. President. Janet, find Bobby. Two fellas caught in a storm You and I. Pick it up, Bill. Let's pick it up. Yeah. Here's my umbrella. Yeah. To keep you warm and dry. Say. What about you? It's the least I can do. Da do. Da you. Da da. Da do. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I like that. I like that. Yeah, that's wonderful. The, the G7 chord. Can we go to the E on that? Instead of the E flat? Make it a little brighter? It's the least I can do! Yeah. It's wonderful, wonderful. Oh, Charlie-Pentagon. Hello, boys. Let's pour us a drink, Frank. Hey Peter. I'm gonna be a daddy. Hey, Hey! Yeah, I just want them all to be tall and healthy like you, baby. I don't know. Looks like he's shrinking. Are you shrinking, Cedric? No, I'm sailing, Frank. I'm just... I'm sailing through life without a care in the world. And on that note... Mañana, Rats. Come on, Wiley. Let's take a ten. All right. Divvy up. What's going on? Well. I'm starting to feel like a messenger boy Frank. And I don't like it. That's the way to stand up for yourself. What's the word, Peter? The word is uh... He wants you to come next month. Ah, there you go! Now you're singing in tune. Okay, now uh. I got to get him something. What should I get him? What should I get him? Well, what do you get the man who has everything? Hmm. You can never have too much. Peter, you should know that. Yeah. Well, uh. Also, I had a chat with Bobby. Told me to fuck off. Do you realize the position that puts me in'? No, I... I don't want to know, Frank. You see, I'm an actor. Frank I'm just an actor. I'm not a messenger boy. Huh? It's humiliating. Do you understand that? I've got the President of the United States of America, passing messages through me to Marilyn Monroe who Who happens to be drinking out of a flask. And then I've got uh, Bobby Kennedy, who's passing messages through me to you... and you're passing messages to Joe Kennedy. You know. I just want to act, Frank, I just want to... I just want to act. And cheat on my wife. Is it too much to ask? Is it too much to ask? One minute he says he's talked to Bobby, the next minute he says he hasn't. It's a lot of shit. Frank says to me, “Johnny... I took Sam's name, I wrote it down, I showed it to Bobby Kennedy. I said, 'This guy is my buddy. This is what I want you to know.” Well, he says he's gonna do a guy a favor. Well, if he can't deliver... he should come to me and say, John “The load is too heavy.“ Then Frank will have to do you a little favor. You see Kennedy and them guys? They treat him like he's a whore. I say you go the other way, Mo. Fuck him. Let him see the other side of you. Show these Hollywood Rats they can't do this like nothing ever happened. Let's hit him. Let's hit Sinatra. And I'll whack the rest of those guys while I'm at it. Lawford, Martin. That Fucking Munjal fruit. I'll wipe that bad attitude right off his face. And the nigger too. I'd take his other eye out. Bing, just like that! So what do you think? Let's whack them all. Nah! I want to hear Frank sing "Chicago" again. I love the way he does that. Winch it up as tight as she'll go, Frank. This is the ultimate, Jack. Sailing under the presidential flag. It's a long way from Hoboken. Holding Marilyn is uh... Like holding an ancient Roman vase. You have to be careful it doesn't turn to dust in your hands. You're living dangerously, Jack. Life is short Frank and uh... Marilyn is so soft. Her skin is like... Electric velvet. Yes. Electric velvet. How's Ava? Uh huh, Ava... Ava is... is bourbon sliding down your throat spreading it's wings in your chest like a butterfly. She's pure heartache. I miss her even when I'm having her. We're in the wrong racket, Frank. We should spend our time in coffeehouses singing the praises of women... like a couple of beatnik poets. Listen, I'm gonna be out your way in March. Think you can put me up? I have a tad more baggage this time, however. Are you kidding me? I'll build a whole new wing for you Jack. Of course I'll put you up. That's fantastic. What about Bobby? The Roman vase of presidential prerogative... was still intact last time I checked. I'll bring some Cuban cigars we'll... sit around your pool...and forget about war and racism and life's other perplexing irony. That would be great, Jack. News flash! Frank Sinatra is telling everyone in Hollywood... that President Kennedy will use Sinatra's Palm Springs estate... as the Western White House. All right this is gonna be Jack's. Right up here. Sinatra has been absent from the Washington scene since the inauguration. And the Secret Service. Now were gonna build five bungalows down on the hillside. Some say it's the Bay of Pigs fiasco that has kept Sinatra from a presidential visit. I want this done by March. But this informed reporter says... it's the First Lady who's none too fond of her perennial bad boy, Francis Albert. I want this done by March. Good evening, Mr. President, General. Good evening, Jefferson. How are you tonight? Uh, very well, Sir. Looks like you're fresh from a swim. They say it's good for the back. Jefferson. Do we have any pistachio? Yes, I stocked up on it, Sir. Let me get it... No, here it is. Never mind. Bobby. How do you stand on mixing peach and chocolate? Ah, I'm against it. Mr. President. I'd be more than happy to prepare it for you. You probably had a harder day than I have. Jefferson. Go to bed. Besides, don't tell the First Lady but my brother likes to eat his ice cream right out of the tub. Bobby, make yourself useful, get the sprinkles. I don't think that's in my purview. I'll get it. No, no, no. He's acting in a dual capacity. I've just appointed the Attorney General Secretary of Sprinkles as well. Spoons, Bobby, and a bowl for me. Uh, General... Good night, Jefferson. Good night, Mr. President. Good night, Jefferson. Good night, General. Ah, sprinkles. So, where was I? Ice cream always seems so naked without sprinkles Pistachio? Chocolate. Can we get back to this? Yes, yes. I know. You've received a memo from the guardian of all that is right and decent. A memo saying that a woman named Judy Campbell has been seen with Giancana. And, that they've traced several calls from her to you in the Oval Office. That evil old queer. What's the matter? Isn't he getting his estrogen? You tell Hoover I've heard of a certain photograph of him and Clyde Tolson, that might raise an eyebrow or two. Jack, this is serious. I am serious. It has to stop Jack. Today! How can we wield our moral influence in Jackson, Mississippi... when Hoover could be sharing this crap with our enemies down there? I also had a memo from Hoover saying he thinks the C.I.A...may be plotting with Giancana and Trafficante to get Castro. It's all about layers, Bobby, like a woman. Who wants a woman who just appears naked in your bed and spreads her legs? Where's the sport in that? No, the name of the game is hide-and-seek. You have to cover the prize with sprinkles... and then, voila... pistachio. You can't stay at Sinatra's house in Palm Springs Be pen pals, talk on the phone. The President of the United States can't sleep in the same bed that Sam Giancana slept in. Not while I'm Attorney General. You don't think he's changed the sheets, Bobby? Fucking Kennedys! Fucking Frank! Good morning, Peter. I want this done. I told you. I'm on a deadline here. - You know the deadline. - Yes. I know the deadline.You got it. Let's get it done. Hey, hey! Brother-in-Lawford! Here, take a look at this. Look, look. It looks great doesn't it? Looks great, uh... You know George...George! Get Peter some breakfast! And this right up here. That's Jack's room. Come on up, I'll show you. So, I'm gonna have phone lines installed. So each room is connected privately to the presidential suite. So that will be great. Yeah, fabulous Frank. It's absolutely fabulous. Excuse me. Can you give us... Take ten minutes, all right'? Just ten. What's the matter with you? You look like you swallowed a stone. What's going on? I need a drink. Mind if I have a drink? I said yeah, hold your horses Bobby. I'll get you a drink. Uh... Jack can't stay here next month. The Secret Service says it's a bad security risk. What? Whoa, whoa, whoa. "A bad security risk"? What are you talking about? I've pleaded your case, Frank. There's nothing... Where's he gonna stay? Bing's. Crosby's? Crosby's a Fucking Republican! How can he stay there? I know, Frank! I've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars here Peter! Everyone knows he's staying here! I've argued your case Frank! There's nothing I can do about it, okay? Tell me the truth! You tell me the goddamn truth! Cause, what you're saying is bullshit! You want to know the truth? Tell me the truth! Well, you know the truth! You know it. Everybody knows the truth except for you and Jack because you're so arrogant. This is Bobby, isn't it? No! This is Bobby, that little motherfucker! No, it's not Bobby. This is Bobby, that little Motherfuck... It's you and Jack. After what I did for them? After what their own fucking father asked me to do for them? You're both so arrogant you think... the rules don't apply to you. Self-righteous motherfucker! They apply Frank! The rules apply! Jack doesn't want this! Does he? No, Jack didn't want this! You think that the rules... Jack is my friend! You arrogant son of a Bitch! Are you gonna be staying at Bing's? Are you staying at Bing's? Are you staying at Bing's! It's family, Frank. Get out of here! Get out! Come on Frank! Get out of here! Get out! Get out of here Peter! That's it! It's over! Don't blame me! Get out! No more movies! No more nothing! It isn't my fault! Get, get out. Get out of my house! Get out! Get out! Frank! What the Hell is going on? C'mon Dean, say something! Frank, what's the problem Pally? Stay out of it, Dean! Frank, please.. Sammy, don't you take his side. Get out of here, Peter! Get out of here! Stop it! No more hammering, no more nails, nothing! Everybody out! You're fired! John, it's over! Stop painting! Stop nails! No nothing! Get out! All of you, get out! Shut up! He's crazy. Get out of here. Get out! We're all crazy Don't fret, okay Peter? He'll get over it. He will. No, not this time. Peter. Come on, Babe. Goddamn it! Bobby, Goddamn Son of a Bitch! You Fuckers! God Damn it!
