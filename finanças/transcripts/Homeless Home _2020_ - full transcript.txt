As you see, what I have I don't owe anyone. I worked a lot, very much. And I cried a lot. And I went through many sufferings. And now that we could live a little better, you see how everything is. You know, it's not easy for an ill elderly to live here. Do you see these hills? Do you see? Before that, I had a large army... but look at today's youth! A bunch of drug addicts who do nothing. Tell me, how did we get to this point? In fact, one lives well here. It's cheap. For the price of a small house in Ghost Town, here you can have a good home and a peaceful life. Well, the weather is not so good. But look, I prefer the isolation here than the solitude of the big city. Living here is to return to the land, to traditions, to be with your people. It's to focus on family again. I think the secret is to cultivate emotions and inner life. Things that help you stay balanced... that get the best out of you. In fact, this is a little lonely. But you can always count on other loners. Having a child is good. It helps. But the problems remain where they are. Understand, it's not that I feel bad, but I believe I'm depressed, like a little bit dead. However, what can I think? If I'm just an animal without feelings. There's no more work here, but you can do something on your own, be your own boss. Transporting things from here to there... Old friends sometimes return. I imagine that no one can escape their roots... even if they are completely rotten. So, what are we going to do? Shall we walk or what? For what? I don't know, to do something! Walk around, see people... We can walk to the Dark Tower! And let my aunt take care of Mom. Without me! We're fine here! Come on, let's go. We never do anything! Moreover, the path crosses the Oblivion Falls. You need to see it! They are so beautiful! They say that whoever crosses it forgets everything. Who is, where is, and all your past. It's like being born again. Crazy, isn't it? Please, I'm too old for that. You know my chest hurts if I walk for a long time... You don't know? Well, everything will be fine. So we'll talk to the Necromancer, who you haven't seen in a while. The Necromancer is a senile old man! But that senile took care of you when you were little. He's not my father! You understand? He never was... Selfish old bastard without a heart! Old man son of a bitch! Listen... I would like a break to rethink our relationship. We can't go on like this... Are you listening to me? I'm leaving. It no longer makes sense. No! Are you really leaving? Will you leave me here, alone? Oh, of course. You don't love me anymore. Don't leave me alone! No, no! Listen! Do you still love me? It is true? If you leave me, I don't know what I could do. I would commit suicide! You know I'm ill, damn it. Very ill! Can't you see? - Let me go! - Just say you love me! You love me? Stop! You are hurting me! - Your smell is so good! - Stop! Damn it! - Stop! - What? Do I scare you? You know I will never hurt you, my love. - Hey! - Hello! - Hi! - How are you? - Hey! - I'm very happy to see you! Welcome, buddy! The army has done you good. You are in shape. And you will see that here is not so bad. After a while, you end up adapting. I also wanted to see you, my friends. - How are you, buddy? - I am fine... considering that I'm an obese and diabetic monster. The doctor told me that I am very sick and... Shut up, stupid beast! Here we are always having fun. You know, always among friends! We always arrive at the same time, always in the same place every day of the year, to eat meat and drink special potions that make us lose track of reality. So, what do you prefer? Human meat or pork? Come on, mate. Have a drink. No, no. I don't drink anymore. It's better not. If not, how do you plan to have fun? Here, beast! Drink, drink... On two legs! On two legs! On two legs! Come on, beast! On two legs! On two legs! On two legs! On two legs! It's always the same! Why do you humiliate me like that? Why? Here, damn animal with no feelings! Here! You disgust me! In fact, when I come here, I feel it is no longer... my home. My father said that our place is in war. I have no place. There is a time when friends are not different from enemies. There is a disconnect, as if you are no longer you. It all felt like a dream, but I know it was real. There were so many corpses that formed a beautiful landscape. We eat their flesh... and drink their blood... and I liked it. Listen... Have you ever seen a lake of blood? I have. And I bathed in it. But why? Why did you come back? This is not fair, damn it! You are a selfish bastard. Well, you've never been here. War is mandatory for us orcs. I had no choice. But you should have stayed, in Town of Terror, or Necroburgo. I could not. It's just that I'm not well. I'm taking medicine. We all have our problems. Mom is very old. She even gave me her magic wand. She is saying goodbye. I know. Your mom loves you, understand? It's not like my father. He cares only about war. I imagine he must already know that I am a deserter. The shame of the family. - Won't you see your father? - No, no way. So, why did you come? Do you think you can come here and act like nothing has happened? I thought you died, damn it! I thought that too. But we are both friends. We have to get out through the world! What do you do here? What do we all do here? Before, we always talked about traveling. Little Sorceress, I missed you a lot. Master, I don't know if you understand me, but sometimes I feel a little apathetic, empty, as if I was already a little dead. Oh, yes... me too, filthy beast. It seems that here, we are all already dead.
