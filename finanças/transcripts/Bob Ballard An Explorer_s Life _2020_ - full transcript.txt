♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ROBERT: I wasn't a Titanic groupie, I mean, I'd read about it like everyone else, I'd seen the movie, A Night to Remember. But I wasn't fixated. And so I didn't even think it would be a big deal. ANNOUNCER (over TV): This is World News Tonight with Peter Jennings. PETER (over TV): Good evening there is no more famous shipwreck in the world, and the discovery of the Titanic in the Atlantic off the coast of Canada has been the dream of countless deep-sea explorers. BART (off-screen): Scientists found the wreckage of the ship said to be unsinkable in the darkness beneath 13,000 feet of water. BILL (off-screen): What we've seen this week in the freezing depths of the Atlantic reminds us that those legends of the great ship Titanic were real. ROBERT: I didn't expect the world to go crazy. JOHN (off-screen): From the moment she passed through Nantucket Sound the Knorr was cheered home. ROBERT (off-screen): I can remember when we came back and did the press conference at Woods Hole and then immediately went down and did the big one at National Geographic and I had to do all these interviews on all the, you know, it was a feeding frenzy as you can imagine. JOHNNY: You must have gasped when you saw that. JUDY: Can this ship ever be raised? ROBERT: Fortunately not. MARIA: Those safes could be filled with jewels, money, all kinds of things. ROBERT: I finally got home and the phone rings and it's my mom. She said something that stuck with me my whole life. HARRIETT: I really said that he's done all these scientific things, but in the eyes of the world I think he'll be remembered for the discovery of the Titanic. ROBERT (off-screen): She said, "Now they're only gonna remember you for that rusty ol' boat." and I have to say, moms are always right. CHARLES (off-screen): Explorer Robert Ballard the man who found the Titanic. TOM (off-screen): For the man who found the Titanic, undersea explorer, Robert Ballard. ELIZABETH (off-screen): Robert Ballard who earlier found the Titanic. ROBERT: Titanic is sort of a complex part of my life. I am a part of the Titanic forever now. And I know my obituary's already been written regardless of what happens from this day forward, the guy who found the Titanic died today, end of story, stop. Ok. You know, but I hope you'll read a little deeper. HARRIET (off-screen): I think that many people do not realize the scientific things that Bob has done because there hasn't been that much you know coverage of it. I'm hoping that they will remember him for this scientist that he really is. GARRY: Now let's meet our underwater explorer. (applause) CHAD (off-screen): What is there to know about Bob Ballard that people already don't know? ROBERT: Well, there's a lot I have never told people. MAN: My name is Robert Ballard, MAN 2: My name is Robert Ballard, ROBERT: My name is Robert Ballard. And I'm in the process of fessing up. ♪ ♪ ROBERT (off-screen): My archives, oh my God! My life is documented almost to the minute. My grandmother had a saying that everything had a place and everything should be in its place, she was German. I was born where all oceanographers... I was born in Wichita, Kansas. But I don't remember much about it because I was born six months after Pearl Harbor and my father upped and moved the family to his relatives in California. And so I grew up in California and there bingo! I saw this big blue thing out there. CHET: I took him and his brother to the ocean one day and they were just scared of the waves coming in, you know. And then that wave would hit them and they'd jump and go on until they got their rear ends wet and then after that they seemed to lose the fear of the ocean. ROBERT (off-screen): We lived right near the ocean, within a block of it and I would go in a tidal pool and it would change, it was kaleidoscopic, every 12 hours there's a new cast of characters. And I would go in there and there might be an octopus that's, "How did I get here?" Or it might be a crab that cycles in and if I try to pick it up it's going to defend its life to the death! (growls). And so tidal pools were just this wonderful way of discovering but then, I just went deeper. I started snorkeling and then I started scuba diving and I just kept going. This is the albums my mother made through my life it just goes on and on and on. There's my brother, there I am, little hellion. You know, everything, all my report cards. My brother who, was smartest human being I ever met in my life Grade-A-plus-plus-plus, that was who I measured myself against. Well, forget it. I always had trouble reading. It just took time to decode words in my mind. It was very frustrating. So I knew that the only way I could overcome was to read twice as long. I coped, I would just stay up later, study harder. They were out playing and I was still studying. But the pivotal moment was 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. My hero was Captain Nemo but it wasn't from sitting down and reading Jules Vern's book. No it's from, when Disney came out when I was 12 with the movie. And there's a scene in that movie where Kirk Douglass is a harpoonist that's gonna kill this monster that turns out to be the Nautilus. And he gets down into Captain Nemo's quarters, and he pushes a button and the window opens like the iris of a lens. (makes sound) And he's staring out and he sees Captain Nemo and his crew and they're walking on the ocean floor. And that was like, the ocean has a bottom? Because I'd always saw this featureless horizon, I'd always looked at the ocean like this, but I never thought about that it has a bottom. And there they were, they were walking on the bottom. And, you know, all parents ask their kids, what do you wanna be when you grow up? And I said, Captain Nemo. MAN: Search the boats. MAN 2: Aye sir, come with me. ROBERT: Thank God my parents didn't laugh, they said, really? Well tell me more about Captain Nemo. Maybe you wanna go in the Navy, maybe you wanna become an oceanographer. MAN (off-screen): Underwater. ROBERT: My parents were very, very good about helping me transition a dream, because that's your driving engine, is your passion, because when you get knocked down, and you will, what gets you up? Passion. This is me as a dolphin trainer and whale trainer when I was in grad school. I was on delay to call from the Army. We're all on our own epic journey. Mine is more easy to see cause I'm physically moving around so you see me on a journey. But the journey begins with the dream, with the passion. Where for me I had to go into science, I had to do all these things. Not because I wanted to be a scientist, but I wanted to accomplish my passion. So you prepare yourself. So this just goes all the way through to the present. I was an Army officer when that knock on the door came. You have six days from the moment you open this envelope to report for active duty. You've got to be kidding, I'm in grad school. "Not according to this, Ensign Ballard, you're now not in the Army." Really? "You're in the Navy." Where am I going? "To a place called the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution." So I got in my little VW that I drove across the United States. And at Woods Hole there's a bridge, a little draw bridge and I'm walking across, and I look over and there's Alvin, and I went. MAN (over TV): This is Alvin, the first vehicle of this kind ever built, which will extend man's first-hand knowledge of the depths of the ocean. ROBERT (off-screen): And I went to Woods Hole; it changed my life forever. ROBERT (off-screen): You have to understand where we are, we're in the middle of the Cold War. Sputnik beat us into space, you know it was catching up and all of that. So there was this, what's next? What's the next frontier and they said it was gonna be the ocean. So they began building deep-diving submersibles. MAN (over TV): Alvin provides a dramatic new research tool for the increasingly important and vital field of oceanography. ROBERT: My first dive actually wasn't in Alvin. My first dive was in a cool submersible called the Ben Franklin. It could take five people and you stayed underwater for five days at a time. And it had, each bunk had a porthole, I mean, this is like, you gotta be kidding, this is the Nautilus. When you enter my world, it's totally dark. Eternal darkness. Most of the planet has never felt the warmth of the sun and never will. And you enter a volume that is the ultimate space, deep space, and I am very comfortable down there. A lot of people aren't, but I'm very comfortable in a space with no boundaries. That window, I looked out of it and, now I was in my own version of a Nautilus. MAN: See how peaceful it is here. The sea is everything. An immense reservoir of nature where I roam at will. ROBERT (off-screen): That was a cool moment. What I was able to do with Alvin was to turn it into a geologic jeep. I'm a field geologist. Most of geology's wet. And when you study earth, there isn't a wet earth and a dry earth, there's an earth and if you're gonna study 72% of it, you gotta study the whole ball game. WALTER (off-screen): Project FAMOUS. A joint French-American investigation of the Mid-Atlantic Rift Valley. ROBERT (off-screen): I seem to have been in the right place at the right time for a ton of things. WALTER (over TV): Robert Ballard, one of the diving scientists on the project explains the plan for test-diving Alvin. ROBERT: And then incrementally dive deeper until we finally attain a new depth for the titanium sphere, which is 12,000 feet. I entered this field of geosciences during the revolution of plate tectonics, which was really exciting. You didn't wanna sleep, you ran to class, you were so excited because they were just throwing the books away. WALTER (over TV): Scientists hope to identify the tectonic processes. But there is much more data that must be collected and only the selective hand and eye of man in a free-diving craft can do this. ROBERT (off-screen): Plate tectonics, the idea that the continents moving around and bump into each other, had been presented as a theory, but no one had actually gone down to the ocean floor to see fresh lava coming out as the plates separated. We wanted to prove it was true. MAN (over radio): Ready to dive. Permission to dive. ROBERT (over TV): So what we want to do is to investigate the spreading center to see what processes are truly fundamental to the Earth in its formation or genesis of oceanic crust. OPERATOR (over radio): Permission granted to dive. Have a good one. ROBERT: And it was a grand success. Fresh lava, coming up out of the ocean floor as the two plates moved apart. ROBERT: The thing that impressed me the most was how terribly torn up and fractured the whole floor was. ROBERT: I don't think any of us expected it to be that, so clearly defined. And there it was. Theory became law. And that's when we threw the geology book out. LESLIE (over TV): But in 1977, scientists were amazed to discover in the Pacific warm water springs or vents with temperatures up to 60 degrees Fahrenheit. ROBERT (off-screen): Then it was biology's turn. LESLIE (over TV): And around the vents a myriad of creatures no one had ever seen before. ROBERT (over TV): When I came into that vent area it was like going to Disneyland. That's it! Wow! Worms that were 13 feet tall that when you cut them open they bled human-like blood. My God, look at that. Isn't that fantastic? Look at how many there are. RICHARD: Clams, oh my gosh, clams a foot across but when you opened them up and dissect, they had no internal organs, they had no mouth, no gut, no digestive, they looked like a clam but yet they had no internal organs of a clam. LESLIE (over TV): This is not simply a discovery of new creatures, but rather a whole new ecological system, a system based on chemosynthesis, not photosynthesis. CHRIS (over TV): Did you realize how significant that discovery was at the time? ROBERT (over TV): Clearly we knew we'd found something very significant, because we had never, ever encountered anything remotely similar to what we had found. But we didn't quite realize the impact. ROBERT: That discovery completely rewrote the biology book. So we threw out another book. LESLIE (over TV): Scientists using Alvin have continued to explore the Mid-Oceanic Ridge. ROBERT (off-screen): But that was then followed two years later when we discovered these giant chimneys. We call them black smokers, which was a big mistake, they, wasn't smoke, but it looked like it. LESLIE (over TV): Copper, zinc, iron, sulfur. This is the first time geologists have ever seen how mineral deposits are actually formed. ROBERT: But what we discovered was roughly the entire volume of the world's oceans every six to eight million years goes inside the crust of the earth, changes its chemistry and comes back up. So we were able to explain why the ocean's chemistry is what it is and we threw out our chemistry book. So in ten years, threw out the geology book, biology book and chemistry book. I mean it was just a massive revolution going on and uh pretty exciting times. JANE (over TV): The gentleman with us this morning is, Dr. Robert Ballard. He is a geologist with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and earlier this year, he and other members of his team found things that had never before been seen by human eyes. What else is underneath the seas that is yet to be explored? ROBERT (over TV): Well, that's the point is that, we're really having, even today, Lewis and Clark type expeditions, we seem to think we know everything and this is a vivid example of how we don't. JANE (over TV): Your colleague on this trip. ROBERT (over TV): Fred Grassley. JANE (over TV): Grassley and Ballard instead of Lewis and Clark. ROBERT (over TV): Right. JANE (over TV): Congratulations. ROBERT (off-screen): I was a Boy Scout, Cub Scout, Explorer's Scout, Army Officer, Naval Officer, so I was taught to tell the truth. And I must say the hardest period of time for that ethos was when I couldn't tell the truth about the Titanic. But finally and thank goodness, the Navy declassified what I was really up to. ROBERT: The Titanic was really a cover for a highly classified military operation to investigate two nuclear submarines that we lost during the Cold War with all hands, the USS Thresher and the USS Scorpion. They ironically turned out to be on either side of where the Titanic was lost. And quite honestly, had that not been the case, you wouldn't be looking at the guy that found the Titanic. The Navy wanted complete 100% photo documentation of both wreck sites and to answer some questions. What are the nuclear reactors doing? What's the status of the nuclear weapons, is there any evidence Soviets have been there? I said to both the Secretary of the Navy, John Layman, and Admiral Thunman who was my boss as a Naval officer, what if we use the Titanic as the cover? RONALD (off-screen): I thought it was a cockamamie story, I mean, find the Titanic? ROBERT (off-screen): And I said, "Well it would be a great cover wouldn't it." Finally he said, thumbs up. RONALD (off-screen): I told him: do whatever you want, just don't spend any more money. ROBERT (off-screen): Boy did I work fast. We pretty well knew what happened to the Thresher. We mapped her a year earlier. But they knew very little about the Scorpion. It took me about week to get there and map it. We mapped it extensively and there was no evidence of human remains, I mean, that would've been tough, but no. The reactors were intact so that was good news. RONALD (off-screen): There were no other indications of something amiss other than the submarine had gone down and it had imploded. ROBERT (off-screen): As soon as the Navy was satisfied we headed northwest for the Titanic. I had 12 days to hunt. But I had learned something from the Thresher and the Scorpion that I couldn't tell anyone because both submarines imploded before they came to the bottom so on their way down, the pressure hulls went and that implosive event is a gigantic explosion. And it just blew the submarines apart. But when I was mapping it, we realized that the heavy stuff went down like a bowling ball, reactors, boom, but then the lighter stuff was a big long line and I went, "didn't the Titanic do the same thing?" So let's not look for the big pieces of Titanic, cause they're only that big; let's look for the debris which meant I could space my search lines much wider apart. MARTIN (over TV): But Titanic did not lie where she was thought to be. Days of futile search dragged on. CHRIS (over TV): How close were you to failure? ROBERT (over TV): Well, I had. I was reaching the point of where I thought we'd failed and I thought we had, and I was going, I went back to my room. We had the watch going, it was a mid-watch. Everything happens on the midnight watch, 12 to four. I don't know why. Everything important occurs right around midnight. MAN (over TV): Wreckage. Bingo. Yeah! WOMAN (over TV): Did we find it? MAN 2 (over TV): Somebody ought to go get Bob. ROBERT (over TV): And I went in and there it was. I mean the boiler was on the screen. MAN 3 (over TV): Oh, I love it. I love it! ROBERT (over TV): I'll be (bleep). The sucker exists! Okay, does Cathy got the champagne? ROBERT (off-screen): We were jumping up and down, we were patting one another on the back, and then someone looked at the clock in the command center and says, "she sinks in 20 minutes." it was two in the morning. She sank at 2:20. And that innocent comment just grounded us. And we realized, you have finally put to rest where these souls were lost and everyone filed out and it was a moment of silence cause we were there. And that was pretty, pretty powerful. PETER (over TV): This afternoon I talked by ship-to-shore radio with the chief scientist on the Titanic expedition, Dr. Robert Ballard. What kind of condition does the Titanic look in? Over. ROBERT (over phone): It appears to be in superb condition. DAVID (over TV): How would you describe the effects on you personally through this whole experience over the years? ROBERT (over phone): It's a feeling of eeriness, uh, it's a nice feeling though. JOHNNY (over TV): Would you welcome please, Dr. Robert Ballard ROBERT (off-screen): My life changed after that. I went from being a scientist who no one ever recognized to not being able to go unnoticed again. WILLARD (over TV): Bob Ballard did something that people have been trying to do for 73 years, and that's discover the Titanic 's resting place. You did it. What a dramatic, magnificent moment. RICHARD (over tV): Summer, 1988. A converted trawler named Starella leaves Spain, bound for the North Atlantic. ROBERT: After we found the Titanic, National Geographic naturally said, let's do another one of those. So we went for the Nazi Battleship Bismarck. Certainly one of the reasons for finding the Bismarck was to take a little edge off the Titanic. When I did the Titanic, no one believed I would find it. Now, no one believes I won't find the Bismarck. And I don't, I think I preferred when they didn't think I would find it. It should have been up in here. And I didn't find it. I failed, I didn't find it. And I said, I looked straight at the lens, just as I'm doing now, and I said, "Round one to the Bismarck." I know where it isn't. Give me another shot. RICHARD (over TV): A year after coming up empty-handed, Ballard prepares to renew his search aboard the Star Hercules. ROBERT: So, if you're in charge of when the game ends, you don't quit until you win. RICHARD (over TV): For the men who operate Argo, like Ballard's son, Todd, the long watch is just beginning. ROBERT (over TV): Come up Todd, to 20 meters. TODD (over TV): 20 meters. ROBERT (over TV): Right there! MAN (over TV): Gun decks, right across the bridge. ROBERT (over TV): That's it! You got it. ROBERT (off-screen): You just have to have that stubborn determination to go the long run, don't quit. Look at that baby! We got it, huh! It's in that crater. That was an amazing moment for me. Because my son, Todd, was able to go with me. Not only the first one, when we failed... Just keep going. Go on do systems check. He was standing next to me, when we didn't fail. TODD (over TV): So, it was 100 meters further than what we, wow I guess we would have driven through. ROBERT: And he went with me to Geographic, got a picture of it right over there, when we announced our discovery, and days later he was dead. Died in a car accident with his buddy, taking a turn a little too fast, hit a puddle of water, and into a tree. And my world came to an end. Yeah. INTERVIEWER (over TV): What I'd like to ask you is, how you feel now about Todd's death? ROBERT (over TV): Well, you know. It's awful to raise someone a few weeks shy of their 21st birthday. It's very symbolic to get close and not make it. It's pretty tough. ROBERT (off-screen): I was changed, forever altered. I didn't get to say goodbye. Yeah, it, excuse me, it uh... I knew this was coming. Yeah, it was a tough time. A very, very tough time to get up off the mat and I must say I laid there for a while. DOUG: I was 18, and then my brother passed away. It was a gaping hole which totally tore the family apart. But for my dad, what he had to go through losing a kid. Like, he was trying to heal from losing his son, he's trying to be a parent, he's trying to figure out his marriage, you know, unfortunately my parents did get divorced. He would be soul-searching and figuring out what he's gonna do. And he would try to honor Todd in certain ways. ROBERT (over TV): You learn through sorrow. And if anything, it motivates me to work twice as hard to do things that he would have done. ROBERT (off-screen): The fire was out, and fortunately I was able to reboot the pilot light. I was able to get back to sea. And there's something wonderful about the sea. It's in charge and it's very humbling and you need to respect it and understand it and, roll with it and I think I sought solace in being at sea, yeah, it was, I needed it. And then, what really helped me climb out was something very important to Todd, and that was the Jason Project. HAL (over TV): Ballard's been planning an underwater adventure he hopes will help revitalize our traditional approach to science. And he wants 200,000 schoolchildren to come with him on live TV with the help of a robot named Jason. ROBERT (over TV): The Jason Project meant a lot to Todd. It's the Todds of the world that the Jason Project was designed to reach, and it reached him. TODD (over TV): I think the Jason Project is great because it gives a chance for kids to see what science is all about. And I hope telepresence helps and assist that process. ROBERT (over TV): Here we come folks, hahaha. Jaws. Well, hello! Take a picture. TODD (over TV): To watch them see live footage of the Mediterranean. It's just riveting, you can really, you're breath-taken by it. ROBERT (over TV): A lot of action going on here, we'll be coming back... TODD (over TV): I'd like to help him out someday, if I could. Like with the new idea of telepresence, I could see myself helping him out, technologically. ROBERT (over TV): We could do it better. The Jason Project really, to me, means Todd. MAN (over TV): Bob, standby. We're coming out in 30 seconds. DIRECTOR (over TV): Coming up on the open, guys. Let's knock 'em dead. ROBERT (off-scree): The Jason Project went on for me for 15 years of amazing adventures. MAN (over TV): Five, four. DIRECTOR (over TV): Three to stand by, Bob, and go Bob, standby to pull back on camera one. ROBERT (over TV): Hello. I'm Bob Ballard. Every year, we stopped what we normally did and we mounted an expedition for children from some exciting place in the world and came to them. You're looking at images of our planet that no one has ever seen before. Can you ask them what A-5 means? BARBARA: I met Bob when I was working at National Geographic on the Jason Project. It was all about education, science, children, and the magic of Bob. DIRECTOR (over TV): We should take bets on if he makes back or not. BARBARA (off-screen): I was captivated by it. You know he brought a lot of excitement and energy and creativity. So it just allows the kids to, their minds expand a little bit and they begin to understand the possibilities for themselves. DIRECTOR (over TV): I go back to Atlanta for a short sound bite to come back for the Jason... ROBERT (over TV): Uh oh! Never mind. Science. DIRECTOR (over TV): Here's what Jason is looking at Bob. ROBERT (over TV): What we're going to do, right now is we're gonna go in an collect a sample of some of these living organisms. GIRL (over TV): Hope to see what Doctor Ballard is expecting the see 'cause he didn't know what's down there and neither do we and when we both find it's like we both discovered it. ROBERT (over TV): We wanted you to realize that science and technology can be a lot of fun and prepare you for the future. Goodbye! Ah, I thought it was horrible. (laughter) (overlapping chatter). ROBERT (off-screen): The best way to instill the thrill of exploration is to take you along and I really love the fact that through telepresence, I'm trying to take people to that world of total darkness. It's so cool to go looking for A and find B and it's more interesting, like a tubeworm that's 13 feet tall or a black smoker that's belching out like a factory, or some piece of human history. The deep sea is the largest museum on earth. There's more history in the deep sea than all the museums of the world combined. So, I decided to go on a journey that lasted about 25 years where I wanted to go back into time. Alright, we're coming in on the back of the bridge. We found 14 warships in Guadalcanal. We explored the Lusitania. There she is. No doubt about it. We went and found the Yorktown. We found President Kennedy's PT-109. Alright, we got it. I focused in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea and the Aegean and we found unbelievable numbers of ancient shipwrecks. MAN: That's it. That's it. There we are. WOMAN (off-screen): I remember the first images of this small forest, it seemed like, of wooden objects rising up out of the sediment. ROBERT (off-screen): Suddenly coming out of the gloom, we saw that mast of that ancient shipwreck. This mythical kind of ship that we'd read about was possible but no one had ever found one. Just mesmerized. WOMAN (over radio): Beautiful. MAN (over radio): Ah, that looks beautiful. ROBERT (off-screen): When we're brushing off the dust on these amphora, it's like they were made the day before. I've been going to sea now for 62 years, something like that, and during most of that time I said, never own a ship. It's a hole in the ocean in which you pour outrageous amounts of money. You launching? And then for some reason I said, what if I got my own ship? Could I make this work? and all of a sudden I had the Nautilus. I finally got to be "Captain Nemo". I named it the E-V Nautilus exploration vessel. EV Nautilus that was 2008, and here we are 12 years later and our program with the Nautilus now is like Jason on hormones. Through Nautilus Live, we broadcast 24-7 to people around the world. SCIENTIST (over computer): Well, this definitely generates some excitement. We've got over 15 countries, hundreds of viewers tuning in right now, watching this live with us. It's pretty amazing. ROBERT (off-screen): And we've reached millions of kids I mean, it's a massive number of people participating in our expedition to inspire them and to lure them into taking those courses they normally wouldn't take. OSCAR (over computer): Hello everybody, my name is Oscar. ROBERT (off-screen): I have kids from the Jason Project who work with me now that have PhDs. MAN (over radio): Well, I think we'll keep moving up towards the stern of Nautilus and then move up to the base of the wall. ROBERT (off-screen): And we love to go where no one has gone before because we know we're going to make discoveries, we can't help but make discoveries. We were in the Gulf of Mexico, I think we were about 2,000 feet down, exploring seeps and a baby sperm whale showed up, said hello. SCIENTISTS (off-screen): Oh, wow. Holy cow. Wow! ROBERT (off-screen): I didn't know "Wow" was a scientific term, but these scientists with PhDs were, "Wow, wow, wow, wow!" SCIENTIST (off-screen): Zoom out on her just a little bit. SCIENTIST 2 (off-screen): Wow. ROBERT: Go and watch the octopus garden in the shade when we came in on these hundreds of female octopus upside down, nursing their eggs in a deepwater seep no one knew about. SCIENTIST (off-screen): That's really, really cool. SCIENTIST 2 (off-screen): Wow. This is great. ROBERT (off-screen): Go and look at our gulper eel. SCIENTIST (off-screen): That's a fish? What? SCIENTIST 3 (off-screen): Wow. SCIENTIST 2 (off-screen): Looks like a ray. ROBERT (off-screen): We didn't know what we were looking at, it looked like a basketball. SCIENTIST (off-screen): Wow. SCIENTIST 2 (off-screen): Wow. SCIENTIST 3 (off-screen): We really ticked him off. SCIENTISTS (off-screen): Uh-oh. ROBERT: And then we realized it was an eel that had taken its stomach outside of its mouth. SCIENTIST (off-screen): It just got so big! ROBERT (off-screen): And then when it sees us it puts itself back together our very eyes. (overlapping chatter). ROBERT (off-screen): Swallows its insides, rehinges its jaw, I love it when it shook its head, to rehinge its jaw. SCIENTIST (off-screen): That was awesome. SCIENTIST 2 (off-screen): That was awesome. ROBERT (off-screen): And swims away like a fish. How can you not get excited when you see people who aren't supposed to get excited lose it. SCIENTIST (off-screen): What? ROBERT (off-screen): And they lose it every time. SCIENTIST 2 (off-screen): What have we found? (laughter) ROBERT (off-screen): And you realize how many of those moments are waiting for us? Countless. And what's wonderful about that... Anyone can play in this game, anyone can play in this game. SCIENTIST (off-screen): Oh, oh, oh, oh look. We've got a little octopus up in the column. SCIENTIST 2 (off-screen): Ooh. Oh my God is that the Dumbo? ROBERT (off-screen): And in fact with our telepresence you can explore from a wheelchair. It doesn't matter what your body can do. SCIENTIST (off-screen): Oh? Look at that. ROBERT (off-screen): It's what your mind can do. SCIENTIST (off-screen): Showing off. Hey you're going to be famous. ROBERT (off-screen): And this is very exciting because a lot of people can now be a part of the family of explorers, no matter what. SCIENTIST (off-screen): Aw man. SCIENTIST 2 (off-screen): Alright, we've only another 30 seconds or so, unfortunately. ROBERT (off-screen): It's clearly an adventurous life that I live but what's really nice about it, it's for a purpose. It's not just bungee jumping off a bridge or something, it's an adventure with a purpose. SCIENTIST (off-screen): Extraordinary. ROBERT: Now, I see all of these young people full of the same adventure. Can't get better than that. SCIENTIST (off-screen): I've gotta move along unfortunately. Alright, Goodbye. SCIENTIST 2 (off-screen): Goodbye. ROBERT: Alright guys, I got your great-grandmother's scrapbooks, so this is your great-grandfather, my father who was a cowboy. And this was my first beach trip, Mom and the gang, so this is the first time I ever saw the ocean. BARBARA (off-screen): There's always a question mark about what's your legacy, and I think for Bob if he can inspire great minds, not just to follow in his footsteps but to explore their own dreams, that would be a lifelong ambition. ROBERT (off-screen): Ok, I gotta fess up. My report card. You guys ready for this? "Bobby shows a very good interest in school work. He still must remember not talk out of turn." CARTER (off-screen): Kinda like me. ROBERT (off-screen): Fairly recently in my life I discovered I was dyslexic. The word didn't exist when I was born in 1942. And it was only fairly recently that I, through my daughter, Emily, discovered that I was dyslexic and it's been a sobering experience to look back. I'm seeing myself for the first time I've ever seen myself. EMILY (off-screen): We both kind of took dyslexia very differently, I took it more as a, "Oh, great, something's wrong with me." And my dad more took it as like, "I finally understand what's wrong with me!" ROBERT (off-screen): The rules that I had to follow were not written by a dyslexic and it wasn't fun, and it was hard to go by their rules. You're always told you know, "You're stupid." You're not stupid, you, you're actually pretty smart, you just do things differently. And to see that now through that lens is pretty cool. I'm trying to let everyone know that your wasting talent! There are so many of us that are playing by a different set of rules and we're not taking advantage of what they can do. I want every kind of person, I want the rainbow of people we have on this planet to be on my team because I know we will have the best team if we have everyone bring each of their unique characteristics to the game. Wow, look at that! BEN: I think my dad is a living example of "You never laugh at your kid's dreams." You should always encourage them to pursue things even when they seem out of reach because he knows that that was one of the most valuable gifts his parents ever gave him, and to pass that on is a powerful thing. And I love that about him because he just wants to inspire the same passion that he's felt all his life in others. ROBERT: This is what I was wearing when I found the Titanic. I don't know if I can still fit in it. You can smell Titanic, so to speak, you can smell the expedition. I'm still tired of being the person that found the Titanic. I'd like to just sort of knock it down into the noise level, career-wise so that when someone says, "Well, who, what did this guy do?" They'll go, "Well he did a lot of things." HARRIETT (off-screen): Honestly, I knew that whatever Bob tried to do, he would do. He's done all these scientific things. And I am hoping that they will remember him for the scientist that he really is. ROBERT (off-screen): Hold the shot. Zoom back, zoom back. Lovely, lovely. Here we go. I think what we've done is to show how much more there is to do. And that really the potential for discoveries are just numerous. And I think that would be tragic if my children thought that all the discoveries had been made and they were just a mop-up operation. And, I will always argue that there are countless discoveries to be made in every frontier that you can pursue and certainly in the marine frontier. I mean that's an easy one, actually. That's a guaranteed new frontier. Something here. What's this, what's this, what's this? Seek and ye shall find. I know if you look, you'll find. So start turning over rocks like I did as a little kid, you never know what's underneath it. We are all born curious, every child is a scientist with curiosity until their experiences snuffs out their pilot light. And I'm hoping to continue pouring fuel on everyone's pilot light. So it doesn't go out. Just dream big. MOORE (over TV): Will the real Robert Ballard surface. Dr. Ballard. (Applause). Captioned By Cotter Media Group.
