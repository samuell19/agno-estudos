Britain, home of the frigid, sexually-repressed, unadventurous, uptight and boring in bed. Right? Wrong! As a nation, we have got our kink on and tonight, we're going to reveal just how far some of us go to get our kicks. Oh, my beating heart! We've commissioned a nationally representative survey to reveal the UK's top 10 legal kinks... and we'll be counting down from 10 to one. Along the way, our experts will explain the origins of what turns us on. There's no right way to be kinky. There's a lot of kinky things going on behind the curtains. So if you ever wondered what the neighbours are really doing... tonight, you may find out. This is the most difficult piece to camera I've ever done. Our top 10 is going to show what we're getting up to when we think no-one is watching. Or maybe when they are. Threesomes are very, very popular. The kinks we found go from eye-watering... I'm gonna zap you to jaw-dropping. Tell me what your favourite sex position is. Doggy, for sure. From Scotland to the South Coast, we're pushing the boundaries and celebrating our sexual differences. It's warm, it's thick, it's almost like a blanket. So, welcome to our kinky countdown. You don't choose your sexuality, it chooses you. Why do some of us get turned on by a nice dinner and moody lighting... We are all along a spectrum of kinkiness while others need more equipment than the moon landings. And now, it's time to find out if you're kink made it into our top 10. Whoo! You know, might be quite fun. Kicking off our kinky countdown, something 1 in 50 British men has tried. Straight in at number 10, it's cross-dressing for sex. Our survey revealed that 2% of British men have cross dressed for sex. Philippa Perry, a psychotherapist with over 20 years experience as a mental health professional, will help us understand what turns us on and why. It's very peculiar and particular to each cross-dresser what they like. Some people get a thrill from passing as women. Some people just get turned on by the clothes. Some people like it because they feel humiliated in ladies' clothes. Some people identify with the tenderness of the feminine, because they feel they can't be tender as men. Like most cross-dressers, Maurice likes to give his kink a highly individual twist. Born in Italy, he's lived here for 14 years and is a personal trainer. His cross-dressing ritual begins with an unusual type of foreplay. It's all about masculinity. You start with this very slow ritual. I want to feel my body, I want to feel my muscle and to look at my muscle. And then I see myself in the mirror and start to feel this fire growing and growing as I look at myself. Until eventually, you feel that you have to really do it. For Maurice, power and grace combine to create a panther-like sexiness. I feel very soft, but still being powerful. Like a cat, somehow. I'm like masculine guy wearing female clothes, but without losing their masculinity. Maurice has been aware of his kink since he was a child. When I was about 10, 11, a friend in school told me that he tried his mother's tights on. So I said, "OK, I'll give it a go myself." My legs started to shake the moment I put the tights on. The idea of doing something forbidden is a turn-on for some people. That probably could be traced to childhood. But you know, why trace it to childhood? What difference does it make? We know something turns us on because it feels naughty, then why wouldn't we do it? A kink is a kink, so I accept yours, you should accept mine. The sex toy industry stimulates the British economy by £250 million a year. There are toys for all tastes. So, now, guess the sex toy a game for adults only. What's this and what's it for? Let's find out. I can't quite figure out how that could be used in a sexual way. It could just go up someone's arse, but you could say that about most things. Is this modern? A willy squeezer. Is it like an Amish sex toy? Now I'm getting the feeling it's some sort of clamp, and that's worrying me a little bit. A ball clamp! You put your balls in it and then you squash them and squash them and squash them. Oh, no, you don't. Really? It's for stretching? People are stretching their balls? What happens to your penis? Does it go over the top? So, it just... hangs like that? Like an enormous wooden moustache? Well, there we go. I tell you what, it's nicely finished. Secret Santa for the boss, anyone? Wellies at the ready, everybody at number nine, it's watersports. Once a complete taboo, watersports have now gone mainstream. Our survey revealed that over 1 million of us have a splashing time in and out of the bathroom. Belgian sexologist Goedele Liekens' philosophy is to ensure that whatever type of sex we have, we get maximum pleasure. Let's get straight to the point. Watersport is about people who are aroused by urine, often by urinating on each other. Now, you might not get aroused by the sound of it, but for some people it creates a warm, erotic feeling inside and outside. Some people get aroused just by the idea of urine itself, like a fetish. Even the smell can be arousing. It has to do with reaching a deeper level of intimacy, of trust together, doing something naughty and forbidden, and that can make the sex they already have even more intense. Even if watersports are not for you, it never hurts to know some basic moves. Here's an oldie but a goldie the 'Golden Shower'. First, you have to decide between the two of you which way things are going to flow and then the receiver well, he gets ready to receive and the giver just starts urinating. If you want to get into watersports, you might want to stay in the bathroom or maybe make some changes to your bedroom, like putting on waterproof sheets and a lot of towels. I don't know who comes up with these names, but the next technique is called 'Cataracts of the Nile'. The man basically kneels between the legs of the woman and aims his urine straight at her clitoris, which she might or might not find delightful. As long as you're healthy, urine is perfectly safe. But it wouldn't do you any harm to drink plenty of water before starting to play. That makes urine less concentrated. There's nothing wrong with watersports, as long as it is between consenting adults. Lots of people enjoy it. According to our survey, watersports is very definitely one for the boys. It sounds a bit of a cliché to say we're all the same under the skin, but there is a great sense in this that that's true. The national sex survey has peered behind Britain's curtains and dungeon doors to reveal the top 10 favourite kinks. At number eight, bits of the body that get us going. It's not necessarily a part of the body that we consider normally sexual like, say, breasts, that you might be turned on by, but it can be something like feet. Our national sex survey says it's feet first for 3% of British adults that's 1.5 million of us. Helpful tip if you think feet might be your thing, move to the north of England. There's a big foot fetish party scene there, apparently. Penny and Leo have been together for five years. My name is Leo. I like feet and for some reason, I feel like that's socially unacceptable. The arch of the foot is very important. I don't suppose a flat foot would do it for me. That feminine arch, which is totally different to a guy's flat foot. And women have quite nice, you know... That sexy arch is perfect for me, yeah. When I first found out that Leo had a foot fetish, I found like a blog this woman had written about fetishes and stuff like that. She spoke about the toe sucking and the licking of the toes and how the only thing she could compare it to was oral sex. And I'm thinking, "Yeah, right!" "Alright, alright." And then I experienced it and I completely agree with her. It's very much like a similar sort of feeling. I think what a lot of men and women don't realise is the clitoris is actually on the big toe. That's why they can never find it! People should definitely embrace their fetishes. One possible explanation for food fetishism is what psychotherapists call 'imprinting'. Imprinting is when we fall in love with something that we first see in a very early time of our life. Now, sometimes it's called Gosling Syndrome, because it's well known that baby geese fall in love with the first thing they see after coming out of the shell. And it might be that, you know, a little baby crawling around on the floor - the first thing that makes a big impression on them is a foot. So maybe that's how we develop, say, a foot fetish. Some food fetishists are all about the naked foot. Others are about feet and shoes. Philippa Perry has come to a specialist fetish footwear factory in London. One of the company's employees, Amy, is also a part-time dominatrix providing foot fetish services. Can you tell me the sort of things that people that are into footwear and feet get off on? They look at your arches, they look at your heel, they look at the way your toes are sitting in heels. Normally you just put your toes in a guy's mouth you know, you simulate oral sex or whatever, and that is what a lot of guys get off on. I mean, I get everything from trampling to... Trampling what's trampling? Trampling is where a man has his genitals and you have to stand on it with your stiletto high heels. I get it, but for me, I don't really want to put my stiletto heel down your penis. Why do you think people develop this fetish? I think it is a floor, dirt, "you are the lowest of the low, "you need to be trampled, you need to be reminded". You walk on your feet, your feet are dirty, your feet are sweaty. "Kiss my feet. Suck my toes." That is such a bad thing to say to somebody. There is a spectrum, isn't there? Sort of like the guy that goes, "Ooh, you look nice in those shoes," to the guy who can't get off unless there is a pair of shoes involved. Yeah. But I think the shoes, and even the feet, are beside the point. The human fetish process, if you like, is actually part of everybody's sexuality to some extent. When you slow the process right down, it's not, "Phwoar, feet!" It's more... it's the 'phwoar'. It is the emotion that the feet evoke in you that turns you on. In fact, any part of the body, or body type, turns someone on, even if it doesn't meet society's narrow definition of beauty. Our survey reveals that 575,000 of us are turned on by obesity, 432,000 by people who are shorter than average, and 407,000 of us by amputees. Finally, there was just one respondent in our survey who reported a fetish for men's wrists. Britain is nothing if not diverse, but some kinks were just too obscure to make the cut for our top 10. Somebody who sort of, like, plays with balloons for sexual gratification, they are referred to as a 'looner'. These come in some super shapes and super, super sizes. The smell of them can be rather erotic and sensual at times. So many different positions and ways you can use balloons. You can get them with messages on, like "I love you". Another of our looner's hobbies is travelling the UK rail network - for fun. Just keep on inflating a balloon until it sort of like just bursts in your mouth, can't take the air anymore you're putting into it. It can just be the sight of your partner with them. And all of a sudden, something can happen... and, you know, a balloon can unexpectedly burst. The next thing you know, you've shot your load! If you think that was kinky, we're just getting started. Still to come tonight, there's this... Argh! ...this... oh, and this. And now, guess the sex toy - a game for adults only. What could this be the key to? Guessing it's a cock ring. No? Can't imagine that you... put it into anything. That to me looks like a wall plug. You know... doing some drilling, pop it in, shelves are up. Oh, I've just had a... Do people put this down the ends of their penises? Is that what this is for? Oh, that's... Yes. That's actually what it is? Fucking hell. Why?! Oh, it's for turning. If someone came at me at that, I think I'd say, "Where has the romance gone? Really?" "Ribbed, for his pleasure." Could be handy on a picnic if you've forgotten the corkscrew, maybe. If you thought that was painful, then number seven is probably not for you. Number seven is all about humiliation. Our survey confirms that 2% of British adults are sexually aroused by being humiliated. Philippa Perry thinks the desire to be humiliated is a coping strategy to deal with unpleasant feelings from childhood. They've switched things around. In their childhood, in their babyhood, maybe they had no choice about submitting to a humiliating bath or whatever it was. But when they're are an adult, they are in control of it, they've switched it, and they've sexualised that feeling of humiliation. Now, it might be a way of making those feelings tolerable, to sexualise them. Humiliation can take many forms. Meet Georgio, a waiter from south London. In private, he's already experimented with submissive sex. But today, he's taking a beginners course in public humiliation. If you're trying to sneak up on me, you're doing a dreadful job. Come and greet me properly. And one on that one. Stand there and wait for me 'til I'm ready for you. There is an element of acting in what I do. I can lose myself in the playacting almost to the same degree as the person who is playing with me. It looks stressful, but if this is your kink, it can be surprisingly relaxing. Somebody's telling you what to do, then the rest of the world disappears, so therefore, they can't think about anything else but that moment and that time. Humiliation is one of the ways that some people have that release of stress and tension. Mistress Absolute guarantees total obedience by using a remote-controlled electro-shock collar. It's not for your neck, it's to go round your cock and balls. Just to keep you attentive for me at all times. There's a toilet over there, you can go and put it on yourself. - Yes, mistress. - Off you go. Georgio's training is about to step up a gear. Mistress Absolute wants him to do a simple bit of shopping for her. If you don't get it right, we know what's gonna happen, don't we? You give me a shock. I do give you a shock, yes. Just like that one. Right, when you can hear me, I want you to put the phone in your back pocket. Are you ready? The three things I want you to get are... a pair of stockings, a book on bondage, and I want you to get me a... massage oil. And you have one minute to do it in. - One minute. - Yes. Get in there, go. Further, further. You have 60 seconds to do this in. Do not piss me off. Come on, hurry up, hurry up. No, no, I didn't say one of those. Oh, for God's sake. You are dawdling. Hurry up! 30 seconds left. No, not one of those! I'm gonna zap you. I'm going up to number six. Hurry up. No talking to the lady. Those are not... A suspender belt?! You have about 15 seconds left and I'm going up to number eight on the zapper. Ah, ah, ah - what do you think you're doing shopping? Sorry, sorry. Did I tell you you could buy any of this stuff, you dirty pervert? - Did I? - Oh, sorry. Did I? No, I didn't. Take the card back. I'm very sorry, he's not allowed those. Get out! Ouch! Understandably perhaps, Georgio decided that public humiliation wasn't for him. Keep walking. If you like getting messy, then you might be interested in another unusual kink that didn't quite make our top 10. This is sploshing. This is getting messy, having sex with food. It will go from playful pie-fighting into more massage, then it will just take off from there. Just the feeling. It's warm, it's thick, it's almost like a blanket around me. There is no friction, there is just pure movement. As children, we're told to be tidy and you can rebel against the adults. If you rebel at the same time when you have a sexual awakening, then the two can get linked. It's kind of rebelling against the whole seriousness of life. People without kinks view people with kinks as being very odd and strange. But the people with kinks have accepted something of who they are and gone on to be happier. Sploshing may not be to everyone's taste, but as far as Goedele Liekens is concerned, it's just another example of a healthy appetite for sex. We are far too judgemental about sex. We don't judge people because they drink a lot of milk in their coffee or because they want to dye their hair blonde or black or whatever, so what is it with sex that we judge and that we think of other people as being immoral? Most people do have sex in very different ways. Kinky and normal. The countdown continues and we are halfway there. Time to find out what's at number six. When it comes to dressing up for sex, we Brits love a uniform. If you are very familiar with someone and then they suddenly put on a uniform, you're not thinking about the person, you're thinking about the role. They can become an 'it' for you, which might be sexy. One percent of us like sliding down a fireman's pole. 3% of us like to have our particulars taken down. But the game most of us like playing is, of course, doctors and nurses. Now, this is great between two consenting adults, but it's not so cool for health professionals trying to do their job. But now, number five is all about the materials we like right next to our skin. You know, silk, leather... latex. I've travelled to the heart of rural England to meet a man called Rob. He's spent more than £10,000 on some very exotic outfits. And they're all made of latex. By spending a pleasant day with him, I'm hoping to find out what it is about latex that he can't get enough of. Is there something in the transformation that's a turn-on, in that sort of you're a fantasy figure or...? Yeah, definitely. It's definitely the transformation. You know, you're turning into somebody totally else that you can't be every day. It's kind of like, I guess, being a superhero, in a way. You can become way more confident. Rob's been married for four years and his wife shares his interest in fetish-wear. She enjoys the more fashiony side of stuff. She's quite happy to go along with it and she enjoys the peace and quiet when she's stuck me in something and locked me up for a few hours. Can you finish this sentence for me without thinking about it? "When I am dressed up, I am..." I am... an object. "When I am dressed up, I am..." A toy. "When I'm dressed up, I become..." Inhuman, I suppose. "When I'm dressed up, I feel..." Stronger. "When I am dressed up, I am really..." Who I really am, I suppose. When wearing latex, Rob clearly feels more comfortable, unlike the real him. However, this outfit isn't Rob's most extreme one. A suit he designed himself and takes over an hour to get him into is his ultimate turn-on. I was sitting quietly at work being bored and started doodling and came up with this. Once in it, it's totally restrictive and I need help to get in it and I certainly need help to get out of it. Everybody needs somewhere to release. It's a good place to go and escape from the real world and... it's nice to be something totally bizarre and weird, to be honest. I use it as stress relief. It's nice just to be enclosed and float away... and chill out, really. It's not why Rob gets turned on by big shape-changing rubber suits that matters. He's discovered what turns him on and he's got the courage to follow that and I think that's brilliant. I think we should be welcoming all sorts of sexuality into the mix and I think if we find someone like Rob here wondering around in the woods, do not be scared. He just wants to be loved and accepted, like all of us. So let's love him and accept him. Also rating highly was leather. And by the way, our survey has also identified a rare but significant fetish for playing with kitchen utensils. Whatever your kink, we hope you have someone special to share it with. Because, as we are about to find out, sexual desire is a two-way street. Sometimes a three-way. Time to get down and dirty, because kink number four is having a threesome. According to our survey, it seems we've taken that very British saying "the more the merrier" to heart when it comes to bedtime. I think with threesomes, it's all about the fantasy, it's all about the idea. And it might be all about the association of porn films you've watched as well. People might think, "I've had an orgasm "while watching an orgy on my computer screen "and now I want to go after that for myself." We asked Sophia Money-Coutts, who has written about threesome etiquette, to give us a couple of top tips. Don't leave anyone out. That just wouldn't be polite! There must be equal attention paid to all three, OK? So it's no good someone sitting on the edge of the bed kind of sulking and feeling a bit left out. Everyone has to get involved. As with anything in life, it's good manners. If you're sitting at a dinner party, you've got to talk equally to this person and to this person. If you're having a threesome, you've got to make sure that person is happy and that person is happy - it's exactly the same thing. Don't hang around. You must never, ever mistake threesomes for romance. It was a bit of fun, spontaneous fun after a party. At the end, I think it's almost advisable to basically get up, don't all lie around in some kind of group hug scenario it's not a therapy session. Get up, move on, done. And now, guess the sex toy a game for adults only. What's this and what's it for? Let's find out. I really don't want to touch that. It looks sinister. I'm gonna just go straight in there and say this is something... to put up your vagina. It goes on a man, maybe so he can do, like, cum shots? Like if it flies out of that. It's some kind of really sinister... fisting glove. This goes into your bum... and they pour something in here, like they pour... wax or hot oil. You put it over the top of your cock and then, I don't know, play with it somehow? Milker! Super not the normal, the super - ball sucker. "Ergonomically designed "to provide perfect pleasure and stimulation to balls "whilst keeping hands free." Oh, well, that's useful, so you can do other things, like make a cup of tea. Can I have it? Could possibly double for a turkey baster, if desperate. At number three, the most talked-about kink of the moment. Millions of us have done it or had it done to us. Yes, it's the sexy selfie. From popstars to footballers and politicians, it seems that British men can't stop sending dick pics. But it is not just the rich and famous. Our survey 19% of British adults have sent sexual selfies. And the age range that takes the most? At 29, Jameela Jamil is part of the digital dick-pic generation. I've seen four penises live. Five if you include the art class I took when I was 16. I was on Tinder and I have now what can only be described as an encyclopaedia of cock that I did not ask for. Perhaps unsurprisingly, our survey revealed that men outstrip women in sending sexual selfies. You know they always say that when you're on holiday, you should never eat at the restaurants that show you a picture of the food on the menu? There is a small part of me that equates that with people who immediately put sexual photographs out of themselves. You've completely destroyed the element of surprise here. We asked Jameela to find out what compels so many guys to send dick pics. Hands up who's ever received a sexy selfie. - From any of this lot? - No. Oh, right, OK. Who's ever sent a sexy selfie? It doesn't have to be this week, it has to be of ever. Have you ever sent...? There we go, the hand is up. If you're just sending that sort of stuff to unsuspecting people, then it's more like flashing. You have to have a certain level of confidence or self-love to... Or insecurity. ...or insecurity, all rolled into one to have the balls pardon the pun. - Literally. - ...to do it. Have you ever tried one but not sent it? - No. - Yeah, you have. Yeah, you have! You've played around with angles. I have done angles but... You never really know, like, you put a picture of yourself out there in a moment, but then suddenly that is there as a permanent record for all to see. There are elements that prevent people from being together, be it distance or even... some friends of mine where religion plays a part and they can't connect with one another physically, so the ability to share that allows that intimacy which they are prevented from doing. So actually, I think it can be incredibly powerful and incredibly positive. I walked into this as definitely a slightly more prudish person, but I was amazed today to see it was almost everyone here who felt that when it's between a couple, sexy selfies are absolutely fine, but it gets a little bit weird when it's outside of that. I mean, I still maintain that I will always be someone who doesn't want to know exactly what I'm gonna get until I've kind of worked for it and that you've had the build-up. I find that very sexy, I think I will always find that sexier. No-one likes a random dick pic, although it seems we are OK receiving intimate shots of people we love. So far, we've discovered the British are a nation of latex-wearing, dick-pic-taking foot fetishists with a penchant for cross-dressing. But now it is time to get really kinky. For some reason, this next one didn't make our top 10, but we couldn't resist showing you. I used to do a lot of fishing. And obviously handling things all the time and just thought that would feel really nice. I just tried it in the shed at my mum and dad's house. Did lay off it for a bit, sort of 2008. But then got back on it recently. I've tried slugs, snails, maggots, worms, moths, butterflies, spiders, earwigs, centipedes, millipedes, crane flies, any sort of fly. Lot of stuff I've not tried that I want to try. Stuff we don't have in this country, like really big worms or millipedes, the sort of foot-long millipedes they have in tropical climes. When I'm out and about, I see a lot of them in the fields and I think, "I could just use that right now." They're really wriggly. Like a tickling sort of sensation, really. Bug lovers, don't worry no worms, maggots or larvae were hurt in the making of this program. In like a strap-on at number two, it's: BDSM stands for bondage, domination, sadism and masochism. But just like any sport, you don't have to buy all the kit before you start. You just use small pieces and small little ideas, like being submissive or being dominant and pushing him down on the bed, or even just saying dirty words in his ear. Great Britain's are getting into bondage at a rate of knots. Our survey shows that a quarter of us have experimented with ropes, ties and the odd silk scarf. I'm in Mansfield in Nottinghamshire and I'm about to meet Kevin, a mechanical engineer who specialises in gas boilers and is also a BDSM master. This is a world I think we often misunderstand. As a BDSM dom, Kevin has kitted out his dungeon with an impressive range of hardware. What does that feel like? That was quite harsh. But I'll turn the power down and that is like a gentle electric kiss. Electric kiss? So is that as bad as an electric fence when I'm out on a country walk? Nowhere near as bad, unless you turn the power right up. I like it to look as old and evil as possible though, because a lot of BDSM is all in the head. It's all about atmosphere and getting somebody scared, basically, and in the correct frame of mind for what you're gonna do. The correct frame of mind? Can you tell me a bit more about that? Well, if they are gonna be in a submissive role, if they see all the tools lined up, that's gonna get their mind working before anything's even happened, and that's gonna make the rest of the play more conducive. So, in this sort of scenario, is it that the victim is in control? If they say no, or their safe word and they want it to end, they can just walk off. This is all about consent. So, there has to be a lot of trust? Absolutely, this is all about trust. Trust and consent. I've just noticed out of the corner of my eye something that looks like an electric drill-come-machine-gun with a massive dildo on the end of it! Wow! This is a serious bit of kit, is it not? I made it originally just for the intimidation factor and just to scare the crap out of people. - Which does actually work! - Yep! But some people have been silly enough to try. Argh! OK, that's quite enough, and I'm only holding it! Geez. I'll put that back then, before you hurt yourself. Ahh! Oh, my beating heart. From the outside, it might look like the BDSM scene is kind of violent and dangerous. But actually, it's quite safe, because the perpetrator and the victim have agreed to do it and they've pre-agreed what the boundaries are, what the safe words are. They are very sort of respecting community, actually, and anyone who transgressed the codes, I mean, they'd just be thrown out of clubs or get a reputation and might find it hard to find partners in future. I've had the dungeon guided tour. Now it's time to see Kevin's most impressive piece of equipment. This is the vac bed and it's designed to shrink-wrap whoever's inside it. What do people feel like when they're in there? What do you feel like when you're in here? Everybody gets a different sensation, depending on their personality. Me personally, I find it very, very frightening. Kevin is basically vacuum-sealed, so he can't move a muscle. Keen to get me to try it, he's gonna talk me through what it's like being inside the bed. You don't know what's gonna happen exactly, how mean they're going to be or how nice they're going to be. It's a very powerful feeling, knowing you are at the mercy of the people around you. I feel a great sense of achievement when I come out of it. BDSM is all about respect, So Kevin very kindly agreed to wash and dry his vac bed before it was my turn to get inside. Goodbye, world! Ugh! Are you comfortable? Very comfortable. Oh. This is the most difficult piece to camera I've ever done in my short television career. It's quite hard to breathe. It feels like I've got a tonne of bricks on my chest. It's quite an extreme sensation, so I can understand why someone might fetishise it. If you like to surrender all free will and give yourself up to something, then I think this might work for you. It's not sexy for me, which is a big disappointment. It's been a night of experimentation, but don't stop now, we're almost there. If one in four of us have tried BDSM, one in three of us are enjoying our top kink. And if it's not worms, feet, underwear, uniforms, latex or bondage, what is our national number one? We're seconds away from revealing the number one in our sex survey. But first, a quick reminder of the top 10 kinks so far - millions of us enjoy them. Number 10, cross-dressing for sex shows we aren't so straight-laced after all. At nine, watersports - out of the bedroom, into the bathroom. Number eight is all about body fetishes. Humiliation... in at number seven. Uniforms holding firm at number six. Material fetishism, especially latex and leather, crash in at number five. At number four, threesomes. At number three, it's sexy selfies. Tying us up in knots at two, it's BDSM. Aaargh! So, what is the UK's number-one kink? It's the thing we use and enjoy more than anything else it is, of course, our friend in the bedside cabinet. At number one, it's the sex toy. I'm glad sex toys are number one in the survey, because they make sex very playful. It shouldn't be taken so seriously, so I really do advise it quite often. The rise of sex toys coincides with the rise of the use of the internet. I mean, they're not embarrassing to buy anymore, because you know, no-one can see you do it. Huge online sales have made the vibrator the bestselling sex toy in Britain. They're becoming talked about more in the culture, it's not embarrassing so much to have one found in your top drawer anymore. People hear about them so people want to experiment with them. And you know, they work! Stick them near a sensitive zone and, whoo! You know, might be quite fun. Sex toys are such an accepted feature of our modern love lives that even the most notorious toy of all is undergoing a reinvention. The sex toy of the future is the sex bot. Our final story begins in San Diego, California. There's just so many different reasons that people buy them. You know, just everyday people. There is no sort of stereotype, it's really diverse. This factory offers an eerie glimpse of what the future of sex toys might hold. Matt McMullen is a former sculptor, whose original intention was to create super lifelike works of art. But he soon realised that people's interest in his creations was less about art appreciation than kinky sex. When I made the first one and saw how it moved and saw how poseable it was, I said, "You know, you could technically make this thing "into a sex toy." Matt's entry-level dolls start at $3,500. There are 11 body types, 31 different faces, 30 varieties of nipple, and all the pubes are crafted from top-of-the-range mohair. But with his latest model, Matt aims to take the sex doll into the realms of science-fiction fantasy. My name is Harmony, I was created to be your best friend, lover and everything else you can imagine. Pretty soon, I will have a full body, so get ready for a lot of fun. She has a British accent. All robots have British accents, I don't know why. Harmony, can you tell me what your favourite sex position is? Doggy, for sure. She moves and feels like a person. See how the leg will stop here and then you can just keep pushing and, you know, it's pretty flexible. It is a fantasy embodied into a piece of art. And it has a really... convincing slap and jiggle. Every week, more of Matt's box-fresh babes leave the factory for new homes worldwide. If I were to list the countries that we ship to, British would be one of our bigger clienteles. Here on Jersey, one of Matt's satisfied customers in 58-year-old Phil, who has had his doll, Kris, for four years. They are such a regular feature on the streets of St Helier that they barely get a second glance from locals. She's very heavy and awkward to move, so she has to go in a wheelchair. I know she's not real, I'm not delusional. But it's really great to have someone really beautiful to just sit and look at and admire sometimes. You don't even have to touch them, they're just there. Maybe you'll turn your head and... there she is, looking gorgeous. Jersey shopkeepers are unfazed by their arrival. - Alright? - Fine, thanks. Nice day. I thought, "Oh," at first. I can honestly say that I've never come across anyone like Phil before. It's a small island, so most people know each other. I mean, he probably gets a lot of stares, because it is a bit off-the-wall, isn't it? - I do like that. - Yeah. - Yeah. - OK. Is she gonna wear it, or do you want it in a bag? She'll wear it, it looks good. - OK. - It looks good. Phil also takes Kris out on date nights to his local pub. The very first time I did it, I approached you and said, "Would you mind bringing her?" And obviously, there's no way she'd be sat there again with her boobs out or anything like that. She doesn't come in dressed up in raunchy underwear or this that or the other. She comes in very respectable. That's his partner - fine. He doesn't care, which is great, I think that's amazing. I think more people should be like Phil, if I'm honest. I don't think it's extreme in the slightest for people to have love dolls, but I was once criticised. They initially said, "Oh, you're a pervert for having a doll," and all the rest of it. So I let her say her piece and at the end said, "Would you mind me asking you a personal question?" She said, "Yeah, no problem." I said, "Do you own a vibrator?" "Well, yeah, I actually do." So, no, I don't see any difference whatsoever in different sex toys. Phil also styles and directs Kris in themed photo shoots. I thought it would make a really nice photo shoot to have me suited and booted for a change and to have her dressed in something really nice and, say, let's do this engagement thing. I may have produced a ring box and then produced a ring. The look on her face, it honestly looks as if she is shocked and surprised to see this ring come out of nowhere. Did she say yes? Yeah, I should think so. But we're in no rush to get married. Personally speaking, I would say honestly, very honestly... 80% with me is the stories, photography, etc, the dressing up, and 20% is sex, yeah. 'Cause I'm never gonna be one of these that denies having sex with them. There you go. Whether people judge me for that or don't, I really don't care. So, after all that, perhaps our survey proves one thing it's time to rebrand. Goodbye, United Kingdom. Hello, United Kinkdom. The British are now a nation of bedtime, daytime, anytime sexperimenters. Who knew? And with that in mind, let's remember sex is like pizza. When it's good, it's great and when it's bad, it's still quite good. Captioned by Ai-Media ai-media. tv
