NEXT ENTERTAINMENT WORLD presents a BANZAKBANZAK FILM production EXECUTIVE PRODUCER KIM Woo-taek YOU CALL IT PASSION "DONG MYUNG PRESS" Have pills for nausea, heartburn, and headaches at hand. Mark my words, you'll be needing them. Why's one missing? Who's not here? I'm here! Seo-jin! Screwing up on your first day. - I'm sorry. - Listen up. Call your seniors by their titles. No need for 'sir' or 'ma'am'. No need for such formality. Understood? Yes! The leisure section. All articles except sports and entertainment are written here. Director OH heads this section. Hi, director. Interns? You are our company's future, so work hard. Who's in leisure? - You look like a hardworker. - Thank you. - Who's the photography intern? - I am. - You? - Yes. You look the same as your resume picture. - Gain weight to last here. - Okay. You're so cute! Easy! He's scared. Son of a bitch! Let's go. Why you! Hello? Hello? You son of a bitch! You can't fool me, bastard! He's at it again. He's always like that. Don't mind him. But... Who's in entertainment? Me. Next time he calls, record the call! - Hello, Sun-woo! - Hi. - So? - They said to sue them. Then do it! Make them pay! You got hurt on a cover! Don't wimp out! Don't chicken out, stupid! Sue them over a sprain? They know I recorded them illegally. I'll lose 100%. There's the bastard. Woo Ji-han, that asshole! Pound him again. Again? Enough already. Pound him until he kneels and begs forgiveness! Pound him 24/7! Yes, chief. Who are you? Why stand there like a ghost? I'm an intern. Here. Does HR have something against us? Why send me senseless interns? "RESUME: DO RA HEE" What a name. Wacko? Is this a real name? Yes. Interns get $900 with no days off. No bonus. Got it? Yes. - Go on. - Question. There are no days off at all? What are you, a psycho? Didn't you hear me? No! Quit if you want. Here's the waiting list! Wanna work or not? Answer me! - Now! - I'll work! Of course you will! There's nothing you can't do with passion! Am I wrong? Where's the damn passion here! Who'll train her? Why duck down? HAN Sun-woo! You train her. Go to him. Remember! Passion! - Come here. - Yes? Shout, "Passion", three times. - What? - Shout it three times, kid! Pa... Passion. Passion. - Passion! - That's a load of bullshit. Go! - Scram! - Sorry. - Hey, Do Ra-hee! - Geeze! - Long time no see. - I guess. How'd the top student end up here? I barely got into here. Weren't you opening a studio? You won photography awards. We're still young. It'll be a good experience. I get we're paid peanuts as interns. Still, we didn't study our butts off to get treated like crap. We're interns with no contracts. Know what my chief said? Lots of people would work for free. We should be thankful for the peanuts we get. I didn't blow my student loans for this. 860,000 are officially unemployed. It's actually 2.9 million. So let's stop complaining and stick it through. Of course! That's best. - Drink up. - Stop! Are you crazy? She'll die if she drinks. She's alcohol intolerant. - Really? - Yup. Something happened? What? U-Kiss? Why's everyone so busy? "DO Ra-hee." "CHIEF HA JAE-GWAN" Hello, sir. Just chief! Yes, chief. It's early. What is it? U-Kiss' van rolled over. Go to Kangbuk Hospital now. What? "SPORTS KYUNG-HYANG" - It's the 3rd floor! - Let's go! Run! Excuse me! Sorry. - Where to? - Doctor! What's the status of U-Kiss? Excuse me. U-Kiss? Oh, the band. One is in surgery. The other four are in stable condition and resting. Who's the one in surgery? The one with blond hair. You mean Kevin? I'm not sure. Where exactly is he injured? A eternal... A eternal rib fracture and facial injury. Does that mean he could die? Where is she from? - Doctor! - Wait! "TO: HA JAE-GWAN Kevin's eternal..." "CHIEF HA JAE-GWAN" - Hello? - What happened? Kevin fractured a rib and has facial injury. Which rib? Well... - He didn't say. - You birdbrain! You have to find it out to write a report! Get comments! - From who? - His manager! Damn. Are you okay? DO Ra-hee? Chae-eun! It's been years! Get up. Hi. Why are you... Dong-myung? I barely got into this newspaper. The world's small with no jobs, huh? You said it. How's Chief HA doing? Still barking like a mad dog? I guess he does. You know my chief? Of course I do. I lasted 18 months there till I got bitten hard and quit. So? What are you doing here? Well... He wants more comments from a manager? Yes. Where'd he go? Over there! See the guy in the suit? He's Kevin's manager. You owe me a beer! - I will! - Bye! - Hello? - Hello. - You're Kevin's manager? - I'll call you back. Which rib did Kevin fracture? I'm not sure. Just roughly? I don't know. They took x-rays all over him. I'd better go. Ow! "KEVIN GOT X-RAYS ALL OVER" Call that a text? Hello? How many x-rays were taken? Well... Well? You birdbrain! Must I teach you everything? Find out now! There you are! What is it? How many x-rays were taken? I don't remember. Just roughly. Please just tell me? Maybe around 30? 6 of them showed something, so he's getting a CT scan tomorrow. Let's just say he got 32 x-rays. Tell others that, too! Uhhh... Ok. He got 32 x-rays and 6 showed problems so he'll get a CT scan. So where is he getting the scan? Is it the hip, the head, or what? Well... I'm the idiot for sending you. I'm the birdbrain. Damn. What's so funny, fool? I'm at Kangbuk Hospital. Who's that behind her? Isn't that our intern? - What? Is she eating? - She must be very hungry. Is she insane? - Yes? - Is the gimbap good? You're on TV now, fool! What? Look away! It's because I didn't eat all day. U-Kiss is here. Are you out of your mind? Wait! Do you work with U-Kiss? That's just great. No. Sorry! Do the interview! Why not! Think you deserve to eat after working like that? Chief. I didn't eat all day and did everything you said. Can't you at least say that I worked hard? Good job eating like a pig. You worked hard, so don't work anymore! If you come, you're dead! Hang up! Fine! I won't! I won't go to that lousy paper! - What the hell? - Think I can't go anywhere else? I didn't hang up! "MOM" - Mom? - Sweetie! I'm so proud of my girl! I just saw you on TV. Actually, it's really hard and I don't think it suits me. No job suits anyone perfectly. You'll pay your own rent, right? What? - It's too sudden to... - I'm hungry! You're dad wants food. Take care! You go, girl! Mom! "DONG MYUNG PRESS" My glue. HAN Sun-woo! That's more like it. Go to Woo Ji-han's film briefing. I'm copying the press kit. How can you pound him just from that? Go now. You know JS won't deal with us anymore. There's no use going. Then just crash in or something! They have heavy security! How can I? They know me, I can't go in. What a reporter! OH Ra-hee! I'm DO Ra-hee. Nice name, Wacko! Go and find something to diss Woo Ji-han. Me? Yes! They don't know you. And you're small and hard to see. True, but what should I diss on? Like his manner. His arrogance. Diss his acting. It sucks. But they don't screen the film at a briefing. Isn't the trailer out yet? They'll release it there. How can you diss his acting on one trailer? Why not? HAN Sun-woo? The release of the film's trailer alone is expected... to raise concerns on Woo Ji-han's acting once again. Such a great writer. Isn't that great? Is it okay to expect concerns and... Why you! HAN Sun-woo! How are you training her? Do it right! Listen up. You don't know anything. So if you open your mouth, it's all trouble. Don't think, feel, or have opinions now. Those things come when you deserve them. Understood? That look! Don't do that either! Don't show how you feel! "Do interns need to write a letter of resignation?" Who'll interview KIM Woo-bin tomorrow? You? I'm off tomorrow. Why are you off at a time like this? Where's Sun-woo? - He's staking out at WOO Ji-han's. - That's good. WOO Ji-han, that lying bastard. KIM Woo-bin? So who's going? Are you testing my patience? - HA Ji-eun, you go. - Okay. Is she out of her mind? Romio is a new idol group that topped the charts today. - Interview them when they come. - Okay. - The boss ordered it. - Okay. Ra-hee! - Yes? - Come here. Yes. Interview them when they come. Me? I outgrew dealing with newbies. Doesn't our title song suck? You think? The company told us to do it, but it sucks. - What song do you like? - The third track. Then why didn't you tell them? It's a ballad. There's no dance. And no hook. Ballads don't make money. So they don't make titles. It must be hard not being able to choose. Our boss only cares about money. Once after 6 shows straight, our youngest got really sick. Know what our boss said? What did he say? That he should still work for his feed. Believe that? You're not writing that, are you? Of course not. Our chief said lots of female celebs commit suicide. He said why don't they sleep with poor men before dying. Isn't he a bastard? An article I wrote all night got canned. Then rewrite it... I would, but they said to just copy from a blogger. That's nothing. I dissed Big Bang once and got 3 billion enemies. See? DIE! The director told me to work hard and touched my waist. I'm not a call girl here! Really? Make a formal complaint. Dong-myung entertainment section. Put Chief HA on. He's not in at the moment. Where'd he go? I'm not sure. Who's calling please? You don't know who I am? I don't have the talent to tell just from one's voice. Who the hell is this? Guess who! Why you little! Wait right there! Damn it! Who just took my call? Was it you or you? I'm screwed. No money for pills, keep working. Nice. What's the problem? Know who their boss is? Who? Husband of the 2nd niece of the boss of the Jodong. So? Know how many ads they give us? Good thing I stopped it before it got out. So you stopped it. Relax. Must we cover our ass at our age? Why? Things are bad again? I don't know. Write a correction article and fire the reporter. What do you mean? The boss heard about this. Someone's gotta take the fall. What? Fire her over one article? Then you quit. Fine then! Come on. I was just kidding. Please move, director. Let me pass. Wait. Who's the wacko that took my call? "DO RA-HEE" We work our butts off to barely put out shit! You dumped it on the intern? Did you take the director's call? Well... Yes. Are you insane? Do you greet all your seniors? What? Of course I do. Do you greet seniors from other sections at all times? Do you greet them even in bathrooms and hallways everytime? I meet people all the time. Must I greet them? Must I greet them? She's talking back to me. What are you going to do? - Good Afternoon. - Louder! - Good Afternoon! - Your breasts are showing! Trying to be sexy? Good Afternoon. Good Afternoon! Good. Good Afternoon! - Keep it up. - Yes. Good After... Thank you everyone who helped us get here! Good Afternoon. Can't hear you. Boss! Good Afternoon! We love you, sir! Good Afternoon! Cheers! You're all here? - Hello! - Sit down. Why are you so late? - You drank already? - Of course Director! I have something to say. I went a little far before. So sorry. What happened? She wrote some weird stuff. So I patted her to encourage her. That's nothing. I said I saw her breasts. Should I apologize? There was nothing to see. Bastard. Did he? No, it's okay. Really! There's nothing to see. Looks like you'll work here fine. Cheers to our newbie DO Ra-hee! Cheers! Hey! Ra-hee! Are you okay? Stupid! Why'd you drink? That's gross. I'm going. It's dangerous at night! I'll go with you! Man! You should help her! - Taxi! - Help! Hey! Geeze! Carry me. Okay, okay. I'll carry you. Why you... Don't throw up on me DO Ra-hee. - Let's go! - Sure. Let's go home. Seo-jin? Seo-jin! Why are you here? You said to stay. Did we... Of course. That's crazy! We didn't do it. I don't touch drunk girls. Whatever happened last night, didn't happen. Okay? So we're not dating? Dating? You said, let's date. I did? Take it back then. Well... No need to take it back. Is this your journal? What's the main point? That they'll work hard... Of course they'll say that! They won't say they'll quit within a year just to earn money! Are they crazy? Write it again! Rewrite it! Do it again! Write it again! Again! Again! You're making my throat hurt! Rewrite it. Damn. Hey, kid! Don't come back. Go.

Can you get me 2PM'S autographs? - Sorry. - Hello? - Ra-hee? - Yes? - Re-edit the Star News's exclusive. - Okay. - Change the ending slightly. - Yes. Dong-myung entertainment section. Hold, please. Chief! It's Mega Pack. No, it's Wrecker Park. Hey, Wrecker Park. Okay! Great! Turn on Star TV! Hurry! Who's Wrecker Park? A tow truck driver. We get tips from tow trucks? We got connections with ambulances, cabs, valet parking, and even customs. WOO Ji-han was attacked near home and has been hospitalized. That bastard. HAN Sun-woo? Why are you spaced out? Get to work! What do you think? It's just a show. A show? For what? They work him non-stop. Maybe he wanted a break. A show for a break? Something smells fishy. He gets attacked on his turf with all that security on him? Weird, right? - I've got his location! - Where is he? - Kyunghee University Hospital. - Okay. Go! Hurry! If your guess is right... This is a huge exclusive! Bury WOO Ji-han for good this time! I got an interview soon. What interview? Who's the bastard? Director IM Kwon-taek. You should go. Hurry! Go! HA Ji-eun! I'm going to Big Bang's showcase. I'm late. - Mun-Kyung? - It's my son's school sports day. Wasn't this a while ago? Nope! That was for my 2nd son. Assistant chief? How about it? I outgrew that. Who cares? Come on. Where are you going? - Meeting with Screen Actors Guild. - Bye! What meeting in slippers! They're all useless. Got something to do? Me? I have to re-edit... Tell us something! Came to chew gum? Don't just stand there! Excuse me! Sorry! - Hi. - What's going on? - Let's go. - What? Is security that tight with all celebrities? JS is like that. And WOO's a troublemaker. Still, isn't that a bit much? I chased WOO Ji-han for over a year. He's got guards at home, work, and while working out. Even when he's taking a dump. What attack? Do it. Damn! Why me? Do we have to do this? An exclusive will get you promoted! This is our only way in! Step on it! I'm really doing it! Hide your press card. Let's see where he is. Damn. I know those bastards. - You do? - Yup. Now what? Go to Plan B. You should go in. Long time no see! I heard WOO Ji-han's here. Came to pay him a visit. - You can't go in. - Why not! - Let go! - Back off! You want a piece of me! - Die! Bastards! - Stop! This is suppression of the press! Oh god! You're in better shape than I thought. Who are you? I'm reporter DO Ra-hee from Dong-myung. How'd you get in here? The security is so tight! I barely made it in alive. What are you doing? I'm covering a story. Please go. Then can I use this? Shall we do the interview then? Stupid! Do your job right! Get rid of the press! I told you to stay put till you go. You know how much it cost me to get you that role. You wasted your money. Look, Top Star. I'm JANG Yu-jin. I made it here offering girls to moguls. And kissing ass to shitty producers! If you don't want to go back to then, stop now. You want to go to court? You damn son of a bitch! Why you! Snap to it! No one cares what happens to me. I can always just start over. But you! Think you can? Just go quietly to the States. We'll talk when you get back. As you all see, Ji-han is fully recovered. We apologize for any concerns we may have caused. I have very good news in return. The Hollywood blockbuster, 'Stranger', by director McKinsey... Ji-han has landed the starring role in it. AHN Su-yeon? Can I really let this out? Instead, please keep today a secret. It's good for me. But are you going to be okay? I'm back. How'd it go? I didn't find out much. Was he attacked or not? Yes. But the CCTV was broken at the time. - He has a bruise and... - Hey! You believe that shit? He didn't look injured much. That's why it's weird! What about others? They're all writing about him going to the States. Going to the States is the smokescreen. JANG Yu-jin, that witch, is covering something big! That's why I told you to go. Why make me send a newbie! Why make me lose an exclusive! Sorry. Whatever. Don't let her write anything from now on. Don't let her do anything! Why'd she shoot into our world! Damn it! How can he diss someone right to her face? Isn't our chief a little weird? A little? No, a lot! - Right? - Yup. - Getting weirder by the day. - I know! But our section still exists because of him. What does that mean? Free tabloids and Internet are filled with celebrity gossip. Our section almost got canned many times. He'd use any dirty means possible to save our section... Though he got cursed at like hell. Yes, he's a weirdo. But he's got conviction. What conviction? To maintain his reporters' jobs. What? That's not easy to do. The old boss never stops nagging. He's fuming for losing two ads this month. Is it entertainment section's fault for losing them? It's pretty serious. It won't take letting go of a few kids. What do you mean? Get me an exclusive. Exclusives don't just fall from the sky, you know! Other sections deal with facts and can't fool around. But your section is different. We deal with facts, too! Think we write fiction? Then bring me a shocking fact to change the boss' mind. He always takes our section so damn lightly. Quit drinking, pal. - What will you do? - I have no idea. If I bury it, I lose an exclusive. If I expose it, AHN gets hurt. Think she could commit suicide? Not sure. Comments are pretty scary. I know. Don't let her ever write again! Don't let her do anything! Where'd you get this? What should I do with it? It's up to you. Holy shit! Guaranteed media frenzy. It's a big shocker! Do you think AHN Su-yeon will be okay? Why worry about that? AHN's not doing much after two movie flops. If this blows and she tops in searches, they'll celebrate. All that publicity! - What's with the chit-chat? - Hello. The intern brought in a big fish. How big? - Look. - What is it? Aren't they composites? Trust me. They're not composites. Who asked you? - No one else put them up? - Not yet. You had no idea? Not at all. Good for you, fool! Why couldn't you sniff it out? I have to trust a fool like that. Shit. Where'd it go? Yes! What are you looking at? Get to work! - Yes. - There's no time! Nice! Big smile! That's it! Hold on. Can we take a break? 1 minute? Hold on. You exposed it? It's my first exclusive! Yeah, it's a killer. When are you done? I'll call you later. Okay. Bye. "EXCLUSIVE! WOO JI-HAN AHN SU-YEON!" To our intern's first exclusive! Cheers! Chief must be ecstatic. He was dying to screw JS over. Why does he hate WOO Ji-han so much? Because JS is boycotting all our interviews. - Why? - You know... WOO's sexual assault case 3 years ago? Chief had the exclusive on that. Wasn't it just a rumor? No, not really. KIM Jang-mi, who claims to be a victim, came to Chief. They probably had a deal. - An exclusive for help. - Probably. Why did it go under? She dropped her charges and suddenly vanished. What? To where? Who knows? That's what makes Chief crazy. So he keeps pounding WOO because of that? He's got reason to. The boss had to pay JANG a hefty compensation. And Chief lost his promotion to Director OH for good. Then why's WOO and his boss not on good terms? Why wouldn't they be? WOO is JANG's golden goose. Right? That's strange. Ra-hee? Did you hear something? When I went last time... It's nothing. Why you! You're weird. Who's this? You're calling me now? We try to keep busy here. Samcheonggak? Why meet at such an expensive place? Who? Oh... Why? Fine. I'll see you there. Okay, bye. What? JANG wants to meet? It's about time she drops to her knees. - DO Ra-hee. - Yes? Are you done? I gotta check out some follow-up articles. - How about you? - I'm all done. Then you finish for her. Longer? But I don't have any money. How would I know what it's like in Australia? Just come back at the end of the term. Bye. Your wife's in Australia? I sent my family to learn English, but now they want to stay there. Keep up the good work. Please accept my apology. Let's just drink and forget about it. Here. Your article was interesting. I'm so sorry. Don't be! You're a reporter! Why be sorry? You didn't make it up. Everything's fine, right? Why of course! When's Ji-han coming back? He just started filming. It'll take 2 months. We'll interview him. Yes, of course. Why, what's this? I hope you like it. What is this? It's wild ginseng. It works wonders. Your wife would be most pleased. - Really? - Yes! Let's see. Try some. - I feel it coming on. - You do? You have one too. No, I'm okay. - Try it! - I'm fine. Really. - JANG Yu-jin! - Yes? I'll take good care of JS. - Dear? - Yes? Promise? - What? You don't trust me? - Of course I do! Where is she? Hey! - Wacko! - Yes? - Write good articles on WOO. - Yes. - 10 a day! - Yes. - I'll send you the source. - Give 'em to her! Write as much as you can. How about 100 a day? Oops! What's this? Gold? Golden toad? There were golden toads in here? Here, chief. You keep it. - It's okay! - Wait. - Let's go to some place better. - Really? Yes! Let's go! Okay. Let's go! Careful! Don't worry! I'll make JS more successful! Are you out of your mind? I was okay with writing articles every time they scored in soccer. But basketball is different. Write 7 articles in 5 minutes of play? Is this press or factory? Still Why'd you quit? You quit? I can only last so long getting treated like shit. I can't stay anymore. I'm outta here. Hey. What's with him? He quit. Already? What do you mean? I heard they're reconstructuring. Hold on. Let's go. Sit down everyone. Hello, sir! How's it going? Everyone working hard? Hi. Hello, sir. Chief HA? Need a razor? Don't mind me, sir. Why you... Shit. - Hello! Excuse me. - Shit! Chief? Who's that? An entertainment section intern. Set to be layed off? No, sir. She's the one who got the AHN Su-yeon exclusive. - You're an intern? - Yes. AHN Su-yeon was your exclusive? I just got lucky, sir. No. Luck is a talent too. Thank you, sir. I'd like your opinion. What do you think will happen to your section at this rate? Pardon? Isn't it time for a change? How many? 6 for now. 4 more next month. Why pick interns and fire loyal employees? Young kids work like hell for chicken feed... while we don't do much, but take big paychecks. He's doing the math. But you should be proud of DO Ra-hee. Why? When Boss asked her if it's time for a change... She stood up for you. She did? Really? Why'd he ask her that? Jae-gwan... Got any hidden exclusives? At this rate... Sports and leisure may be integrated into the daily. Entertainment section may get moved to the Internet. How many exclusives did you write this month, Ra-hee? - Congratulations. - Thank you. I'm more thankful. Me, too. But it'd be nice if you shared. Don't be jealous, silly. Know how many got sued going after exclusives? You came? What's all this? Oh that. Remember Jong-hyun, my senior? He opened a studio in Manhattan and asked me to join. - What about Dong-myung? - I'll quit. I didn't plan to stay long. So you're all decided. Not really. I should go, right? Do what you want. "DONG MYUNG PRESS" Why won't you expose HONG Kyung-jin's secret? We sealed her secret. You helped her and introduced to a major label. Why did you do that? The world will not end because we expose one singer. Write it, then patch things later! She'll be gone by then. Let's not go that low! We can't just wait around and let others blow the whistle! You call that an excuse? Is this a third-rate tabloid? What? What did you just say? A tabloid? Putting down entertainment 'cuz you were in news? Are you? - Stop. - Move! How many big stories did you land in our section? How many? Even an intern is scoring big within a month! - What did you do? - Chief! I said, move! Look. If you lack the skills, just do as you're told. Don't just sit there and do nothing. Don't vent out on me for losing to the intern. Then I'll just quit. What? Hey! HAN Sun-woo! Come back here! Hey! I haven't seen Sun-woo around. What's he up to? After a fight with our chief, he hasn't shown up for days. Really? It's amazing he lasted even that long. Was Sun-woo in main news before? A.k.a. 'The Shovel', he was a whiz newsreporter. The Shovel? He dug deep into every story. He practically lived at police stations. Any criminals he came across, he'd saw to them getting cuffed. He was so charismatic back then. Then why is he... Curious? He poked at a senator and lost everything. I warned him to just catch petty thieves instead. But he hit the wrong guy. Luckily, HA took him in when no one else would. What else can Sun-woo do with a face like that? Probably door-to-door sales. Did you two date? No way! Never! Why would I date him? Yes. Why? Really? Just briefly. - Holy! - Next interviewer, please. DO Ra-hee from Dong-myung? Here. Change your name, Wacko! - Thank you. - Don't worry at all! Just relax and wait. I'll be going then. - Take care. - Bye. You're looking good. Hello. Can HA Jae-gwan be trusted? He could try to pull something. I know, idiot! Don't act like you know! Find out who wants Ji-han. Yes, boss. WOO Ji-han went AWOL in the States. What? Why? Did you hear something? No, I didn't. JANG's been covering it up till now. But production staff put it up on Facebook. They must release an official report by morning. So we'll write it. You idiot. JANG came because she doesn't want it leaked! What does JANG want? - Watering it down. - You mean... Write that he's not missing because of conflict with her. We can do that. That's easy. But something's not right. What's most important to JS now? The merger with Sami Entertainment. What's that got to do with WOO's disappearance? With millions on the line, WOO went AWOL during production. WOO may be bratty, but he's not downright stupid. It means he did it to screw JANG over. If that's true... WOO's going to leave JS! Then the merger is off. WOO's got that much leverage? WOO's the one that made JS. Who would invest in a place with no lightbulb? But that won't interest the public. I don't care about mergers either! What interests me is... the dirty fight between them. We should be careful. You may end up backstabbing JANG. Who cares? Damn bitch. We just need an exclusive! An exclusive! Listen up. Do whatever you can to find out how the two fools fell apart. Got that? Yes. - Heard from Sun-woo? - Not yet. Always when we're busy... - Tell him to come now. - He won't. Not after leaving like that. Yes, chief. You are no longer an intern so act like a pro. Got it? Yes. You'll get paid more, so buy us drinks. Okay. Chief! WOO's holding a press conference. What? What the hell? When? - Tomorrow at 6 PM. - From what source? We're searching, but it's not JS. You're in charge of WOO from now on. Me? "WOO JI-HAN SOLO PRESS CONFERENCE" Where's it from? Looks like Dee-ho Entertainment. KANG Dae-ho, that bastard! What should we do?

And we cannot disclose any celebrity's plastic surgery. But Ms. JANG Yu-jin of JS said I can call him. Why didn't you say Dr. JANG's sister referred you? Hold, please. You want to go to court?

I'm not sure if it's right to write it. What do you mean? The evidence seems fabricated. What? JANG's brother is the one who wrote the medical report. I'm suspicious of the rest of the evidence too.

What was that? Do you know any lawyers? Why? All of a sudden... I need counsel on threat, exploitation, and illegal contracts. Why go to a lawyer? There's an expert at that. Who?

Don't underestimate JANG. She's got connections in high places. Then what? You got 2 choices. Find the victim and put her on stand. Where can I find her? You can't. Even if you can, victim is not stupid. Use your head. She won't testify. What's the other choice? Speculation article. What? Reporters can voice reasonable doubts about those in power.

It's an exclusive and you'll take responsibility. But can you prove this? No, not yet. Why you little... When do you want it out? Before the press conference. Okay. - Hey, Wacko. - Yes? The...

I'm sorry, pal. Why did WOO Ji-han go AWOL in the production of 'Stranger'? He need to adjust his first shoot abroad. He took an approved time off. Does this have to go on our paper? What do you mean? If we put this up on some sites, it'll go viral instantly. What if our IP address gets tracked? We can't do it here. Don't worry. We have Internet everywhere! Next question? Then what happens to 'Stranger'? Inevitably, he'll have to resign from the production. "WOO'S SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE IS FABRICATED" Where is everyone? How would I know? Probably out drinking.

Then you used that to threaten WOO to renew his contract. Look, reporter. I can sue you for libel. You can't slander me with such groundless accusations. That's up to you. According to my investigation... WOO Ji-han did not sexually assault her. You fabricated things up to threaten WOO. You promised to cover it up and had him renew his contract. Enough with your nonsense. One more thing! To keep WOO and land the merger with Sami Entertainment... you gave Chief HA of Dong-myung the fabricated evidence. Look! A reporter should write articles not fiction. Enough already! Please calm down. You made it all up! What she says is absurd, is it not? Fine then. Can you prove what you claim? JANG Yu-jin! She topped the charts. Really? - That was fast! - She's dead! Yeah! "1.JANG YU-JIN, CORRUPTION / 1" Yeah! Son of a bitch! I can't stand this! The hell! What? Nothing. They did it. Prove it. "JANG's article is released. Check it out." "A tabloid on JANG is up. How's the press conference?" Look! Everyone! The article is not true. I'll sue the one who spread such rumors. We support you!
