[evil laugh] [gasp] [grunt] [gasp] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [Announcer] Japanese astronaut, Himeko Nayotake, has recently been selected to join the renowned Luna Frontier Project as one of the pilots for the upcoming lunar exploration mission. She is shown here at NASA busily preparing for it. The following is a CG simulation of what the Luna Frontier Project launch will look like. Ahhh... [chewing] Wow! That spacecraft is going to the Moon? [dreamy sigh] I want to go to the Moon on that spaceship with Mamo and have a space date! [Luna] Usagi, this is no time for daydreaming... It's your last winter break as a middle schooler. You need to focus on studying for your high school entrance exams. Yeah, well! I don't expect you to understand my feelings! After all, I bet you've never even experienced love before, have you? [chewing] It's not like I... [sneeze] ...even plan to fall in love, so who cares? Are you all right, Luna? I think I might have caught a cold last night [sneeze] Sorry but, I'm going to start heading back now. Are you sure? Here, let me walk you home. No, thank you. But-- I'll be fine on my own. Don't make such a big deal out of it, Artemis. Bye, [tired sigh] [coughing] [groan] [car horn] [scream] [grunt] Look both ways, idiot! [sigh] [panting breaths] You're finally awake. [weak meow] You're still feverish, so stay still. You need rest. Go back to sleep. [happy meow] [yawn] [thinking] Wait a minute this person did he Did he stay up all night Just to take care of me? [Artemis] Luna's missing!? [Chibi-Usa] Yeah, she never came home yesterday. I wonder what happened? D'you think maybe her fever got worse, and she collapsed some -where along the way to Usagi's? [worried gasp] I knew I should have walked her home! Now look... Luna where ever she is, I hope she's safe So What are the odds that she might have run away? [gasps] Usagi, please, don't tell me this is your fault. Yeah! What, did you bully her!? Are you out of your mind? I would neverbully Luna! Then you said something mean to her, didn't you? No!!!! "You're a klutz... a total goofball..." "“Not to mention, a crybaby!"” Those are the kinds of mean things that Luna says to me! You know what, Rei!? [sticking tongue out] Oh, yeah!? [sticking tongue out] [Artemis] This is no time to argue! We should split up and search. Let's hurry! [determined grunts] [seagulls squawking] Hey, I hope you're hungry, kitty. [meow] It seems like you're all better now. That's good. [happy meow] [doorbell] Coming! [Himeko] Long time no see, Kakeru! [Kakeru] Hime?! You're here! [Himeko] [giggle] When'd you get back to Japan? My flight arrived just this morning. [small chuckle] So about the Luna Frontier Project You hear the news? Yeah, I did. Congratulations. Is that it? Huh? Forget it. It's been over a year since I left Japan What's new? A comet, actually. I discovered a new one two night ago. Oh, yeah? Mhm! I saw it passing close to the Moon. And that's why I chose to call it Princess Snow Kaguya. [sigh] You were looking at the moon again, weren't you? How strange, though. NASA hasn't said anything about a new comet Are you sure you saw it? Of course, I'm sure! I saw it with my own eyes! Just check out this crystal I found that same night. I'm totally positive that it fell from the comet. [Himeko] Wow... Beautiful. Yeah, but the comet itself disappeared instantly. And Everyone at the Space Development Agency thinks I was daydreaming. But you believe my story, don't you? [sigh] I'm telling you, I saw it! Look, I heard about that one time you were made a laughingstock after you claimed there was a goddess living on the moon [Himeko] I just think you're romanticizing space a little too much. But, every time I look at the moon, I can feel some kind of energy that's full of life, emanating from it! Am I actually hearing this from someone who's devoted his whole life to science? [Kakeru] Fine then, don't believe me. You've always had a brilliant mind filled with great ideas- Medicine, biology, physics Aerospace engineering! You've earned PHDs in so many different fields! Everyone expected you to become an astronaut. We had high hopes for you. So why do you say such crazy things that aren't scientific at all? [grunt] [gasp] What's wrong? I'm not feeling well today. So, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. [gasp] Please, go. [gasp] You can't seriously be asking me to go away now But I took a week off and came back from America, from Marshall just to see you! Just go! [gasp] Fine then. [sad sigh] [comforting meow] What's wrong with me? Why can't I just tell her that I'm happy for her? I mean, this is a huge deal. She's about to realize her lifelong dream of going into space, right? [gasp] Wait a sec, I never got your name! Lu-- agh! Huh? [thinking] Right... cats don't talk. Hmmm... Sam...? Felix...? You can't be a Tiger without stripes... That crescent shape on your head looks like the moon. Huh... Moon...? Luna? [happy meow] I see. So, it seems like your name's Luna then. [happy meow] [thinking] That's right! Luna's a lot fancier than most names I've heard for cats. I guess your owner must be a pretty well-bred person to come up with a name like that, huh? [obnoxious laugh] Luna, you like sugar candies? [agreeable meow] I always thought they kinda looked like shooting stars, you know? "“If you make a wish while eating it, Princess Kaguya will appear."” Ever since I was little, I believed that would actually come true. Well, what do you think? And be honest... Is it silly of me to think that there's a goddess on the moon? [disagreeing meow] [chuckle] It almost sounds like you're saying you believe me. [Luna] [agreeing meow] I first learned about Princess Kaguya from a fairy tale called "“The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter."” I don't know why, but every since I heard that story, I've always believed someone like princess Kaguya is living on the moon... ...even now. [gasp] Himeko... [thinking] What am I feeling? I've never felt this way before... ...Could this... be love? It's breathtaking...the beautiful treasure that I have desired since ancient times... and now, it will become mine for the taking! ♪Opera Singing ...Now go forth, my precious little Snow Dancers.

[evil laughter] [painful gasps] So, what the heck were those things, anyway? I'm willing to bet they're bad guys wanting to take over the Earth... Whatever they are, we'll need to stay on high alert from now on. Mhm. Oh, Luna! -Are you serious!?-Really!? -Thank goodness!-Luna? Where!? Luna! I was so worried about you! [crying] That's a pretty ribbon! Where's it from? Huh? Oh, this? You're welcome to visit anytime [clears throat] That's not important right now! I just came to tell you, there's a mysterious comet passing by the Moon! A comet? [Ami] So, I did some research... But I didn't find any comets like the one Luna mentioned earlier. If Ami's computer didn't detect anything, what do you think that could mean? Well, there haven't been any new attacks recently. But is it possible those monsters are still around? Hey! Sorry I'm late! Don't worry, we've gotten used to it by now. Well, you know what they say, "early bird has to eat worms," and I did not want to eat worms. Where's Luna? Oh, she said she had something to do so, she's not coming. Hello, potato! Luna's been acting odd lately! She's been reading medical books, and she's eating tons of sugar candy![ That's right. She came over the other day and borrowed one of my mom's medical books. Oh, I almost forgot that I saw her like two days ago near the Space Development Agency Observatory. I tried to say "“hi,"” but I don't think she noticed She wasn't really acting like herself. And don't forget that yellow ribbon. What's up with that? She hasn't even been nagging me to study for my entrance exams like she usually does. Something weird's going on! [screaming] Hot, hot, hot! [Girls] Dummy! Still nothing... ...I can't figure it out... ...what is his illness? [coughing] I'm sorry, not today. You're going to get in his way, so run along kitty. [thinking] In his way? It's not because I'm a cat, is it? Did you hear? Luna's been acting weird ever since she went missing the other day... Hey! ...What do you think is going on? Well, I'm sure Luna just needs some time to herself every once in a while. Maybe you're being a little too clingy. Try not to pry so much, give her space! Wait, you think I'm too clingy!? That's really how you feel!? [nervous laugh] I get it. I bet you think of me as some kind of silly nuisance don't you, Mamo?! No! I didn't mean it that way! [thinking] If only I were a human maybe then I could take care of Kakeru while he's sick [Mamoru] You just misunderstood me, Usako. Yeah but, it still sounded like you think I'm super clingy Listen, I can honestly tell you that I've never once considered you to be a nuisance. Really? I wouldn't lie to you about that. Oh, Mamo! Usako... [humming] Usagi, you smell so nice! That's my potpourri. [sniff] Oh...! So, um, what kind of things do you talk about when you're alone with Mamoru? [laugh] Just about everything! Though, most of the time Mamo is busy reading his difficult books and doesn't pay much attention to me. However if he sees something interesting, he gets really excited and wants to tell me all about it! And that's when... When, what!? ...Mamo ends up falling asleep on the sofa. [groan] What'd I say? It's nothing... I think he can relax like that [giggle] because he feels comfortable when he's around me. [curious gasp] Whenever I see Mamo sleeping, he has a childlike innocence to him. So, Usagi What does a kiss taste like? Huh? I guess if I had to describe, I'd say... so sweet that you'll melt. You mean... kinda like sugar candy? [sleeping sighs] [grunt] -Mamo... -Mamo... Argh! [grunt] Luna You came to see me? [happy meow] You know what? There was a time when I dreamed of becoming an astronaut. But, unfortunately, I had to give up that dream... ...because my health was getting worse and worse. Lately, it's especially-- [grunt] I hope I can at least hold out long enough to watch Hime take off [gasp] She's out there fulfilling my dream right now... Hey Luna, you're also going to wish for her to have a safe flight into space, aren't you? [meow] It's strange I know that you're a cat, but there are times I feel like we understand each other. [happy purr] The Earth and Moon are already so beautiful I bet they look even more so from space. I wish we could both see it one day. Come here... You smell nice, Luna. It's so... relaxing... [Usagi] Whenever I see Mamo sleeping, he has a childlike innocence to him. Kakeru I would love to go to space with you one day. [gasp] ♪♪ [Rei] Guess what I saw this morning! It was Luna looking super happy after a long night out! Yup, that's definitely love all right. Love? Little Luna's finally fallen in love. [heartbroken gasp] Ah well, it's not like there's any real evidence to prove that's actually true, right? The yellow ribbon? It's totally love! Yeah, totally! Guys! Be more considerate towards Artemis' feelings! Sorry... Huh? Wait, what do you mean? Huh? Wait a second You're saying you didn't know? What?! Know what?! How Artemis feels about Luna. [big gasp]... He loves her! You're justrealizing...? Well, they've always acted like really close friends, so how was I supposed to know it was more than that? Dimwit [sigh] I'm so jealous! None of us even have time for something like love right now. Not while having to study for entrance exams [deep sighs] Well, that doesn't apply to me! I have Mamo! [Rei] Let's just ignore her... [Minako] You mean do what I always do? [Chibi-Usa] So annoying. [Makoto] So annoying. But still, I wouldn't mind falling in love with someone after exams are over. [dreamy sigh] Have I ever told you about the guy who broke my heart? He was so great... Speaking of I wonder how myfirst love is. Yeah, same here [dreamy sigh] [Haruka] Those monsters haven't shown up again. [Michiru] It's finally peaceful. I wouldn't be so sure about that. Haruka, do you sense something? Not exactly, But I have this bad feeling about all of this... Me too. I can't quite identify it though It's as if time has completely stopped [Snow Kaguya] [evil chuckle] Enjoy this moment of respite while you can, Sailor Guardians [evil chuckle] [gasp] Hey It's been awhile. Uh, yeah... Luna, if there's ever something wrong, I want you to know that-- I don't have time. Sorry... [gasp] [thinking] Forgive me, Artemis [gasp] [thinking] Could he be the one Luna's in love with? Hey. Today's my last day in Japan before I leave. I see. Good luck. Your dream's finally coming true. It really is. Kakeru I was hoping that when I returned from space I could come back here and-— Give it up already. The two of us we live in very different worlds. We don't see eye to eye. [sad gasp] I see the Moon at its true potential and you see it as nothing more than a physical object floating in space! We're nothing alike! [sad gasp] I'm sure you'll find eventually someone that suits you better. Is that... really what you think of me now, Kakeru? Or is that just how you've felt about me this whole time? [gasp] [Himeko] Say something! Look, I admit it... I never felt any kind of supernatural presence like Princess Kaguya on the Moon before. But! Stop it! I've heard enough! [gasp] [small sob] [sob] [gasp] [sob] [thinking] Himeko's wrong Kakeru does care about her... Usagi... Luna. It's him, isn't it? He's a fool. He's hiding his illness from Himeko. It's awful He's doing this even though he loves her. [sigh] I know this is going to sound silly because I'm just a cat But honestly, for a moment, I thought maybe Kakeru could have been the person I was meant to be with. Like it was fate. However The one he was truly meant for wasn't me after all. [sad gasp] I wish I could magically become a human. If that happened then I could stay by his side as a person instead of as a cat I could confess my feelings and not have to go through all of this horrible heartache [sobbing] Oh, Luna...! [Luna] [crying] [gasp] [high pitched wail] Kakeru! [painful groans] I found it. [glass shatter] [laugh] It would appear the crystal has greatly increased its power by absorbing your life energy. I knew it! That comet I saw; Princess Snow Kaguya, was real after all! "“Princess Snow Kaguya"”, [snicker] What a wonderful name! [Snow Kaguya] Yes, it's true My avatar is slowly approaching Earth as we speak... And you Soon you will become part of my beautiful collection- along with the rest of the Earth that's about to be frozen over. [evil laugh] It looks like the enemy was still plotting something! We have to go and tell the others! It was the crystal from that comet all along... That was the thing that was causing Kakeru's illness! So, he'll be okay now. [Luna] I don't think so... [heavy breathing] But, why!? As long as that crystal continues to exist, the evil aura will too. [Snow Kaguya] The time has finally come to turn Earth into a beautiful world made entirely out of ice! [evil chuckle] [rumbling] [agonizing scream] Wait, I've got it! Huh?? It's something from a manuscript I once read. "“In ancient times, an evil star suddenly appeared." "It scattered ice crystals, far and wide." "...Crystals covered the Earth. Vast lands froze and darkness prevailed. However..." "The power of love and friendship, known as Silver Crystal Power, melted the darkness and saved the Earth"” It's happening again! So, this "“evil star"”Do you think it could be the comet Luna mentioned? What about "“Silver Crystal Power"”? What exactly does it have to do with love and friendship? Regardless, there's a malevolent star out there that's slowly attempting take over Earth. We're in danger! I don't think so! We'll stop it! Make sure to be careful out there. Best of luck! Thank you. [Usagi] Excuse me... Oh! I recognize you. Are you her owner, then? Mhm. Please listen! It's about the Luna Frontier Project... You have to postpone it! Wait, excuse me? There's a comet heading straight for Earth. And to make matters worse, there's an evil ice witch on it! What are you saying? I know that what I'm saying may be hard to believe, but she's planning to turn our entire planet into a snow globe! It's way too dangerous to go to space right now! That's absurd. But... Quit babbling about fairytale nonsense! I'm a scientist. [gasp] What should we do, Luna? [groan] [Luna] I wonder... Huh? It's crazy But if Kakeru could meet the Princess Kaguya he's dreamed of... it's possible he may be able to recover enough strength to dispel the evil aura. Princess 'who'? If only I could transform into a human I could at least pretend to be Princess Kaguya for him. Luna Even if you somehow became a human You and Kakeru still couldn't be-— I don't care what happens to me! I just want to be able to save Kakeru. He told me about how he's dreamed of meeting Princess Kaguya ever since he was a young boy. Can you believe that? So, I'm positive that if he meets her, he'll be able to fight off the evil aura! [sigh] But, it's not like a cat can just become a human That's impossible [Announcer] Extreme cold weather has affected every corner of the world. Even places like this African savannah have been hit by a massive snowstorm. I have no doubt that this is all her doing! [beeping] Usagi. We've located the enemy's base!

Listen, we fall in love and sometimes our hearts get broken... [panting] [sad meow] Hime... Kakeru... And there are times when that heartache keeps us up at night... In our lives we experience sadness and all kinds of hardships...
