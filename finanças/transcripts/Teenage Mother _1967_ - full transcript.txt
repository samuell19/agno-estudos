(upbeat instrumental music) (engines racing) - Excuse me? Could you tell me the way to Mrs. Wagoner's rooming house? - Oh it's about a mile from the station. You want me to call you a cab Ms.? - Ms. Petersen, yes I would appreciate it if you would. I've just arrived here, I'm the new health instructor at Claremont High School. - You're gonna teach public health and first aid? Well that's very nice. - Well not exactly. - Huh? - Excuse me, I'm very tired. Could you please call that cab now? - Certainly. Yellow Cab please. (instrumental music) (tires screeching) - What's up with the get up, I'll run you right off the track. - Are you alright? If you spent half the time on your car that you do making excuses you might win a race once in a while. - Think you're a big man, huh? - [Tony]] Why don't you get out of here? - You gonna make me? - You better find somebody else to play with. Duke's just looking for trouble and someday he's gonna find it. - [Arlene] He's a pretty tough guy. - Well maybe you should've stayed with him if he's so tough. - But that's what I like about you. You're a lover not a fighter. (elegant instrumental music) - Now what's that you were saying about Duke? - Duke who? Can't you take a joke? - Not that kind of joke. - You'd make a very generous husband. - Husband? That's mighty serious kind of talk, young lady. - [Arlene] I mean it Tony. - Can't we change the subject? - No we can't Tony Michaels. I'm thinking about our future. We just can't keep going on like this. - [Tony] You know my parents. They want me to go off to medical school. They've wanted that since I was a little boy. - Yeah well sometimes I think you're still a little boy. Sometimes I think you take me for granted. - Listen, honey. We'll work it out. - You're lucky. I love you very much. - Okay you're all in your honor. Each of you will receive two different sets of questions over your headphones. And no two people will get the same test. So looking at your neighbors paper will do no good. Alright if there are no questions we can begin. Oh remember. Answer and read all of the instructions very carefully. You have exactly 30 seconds to answer each question. Mr. Owens? (suspenseful music) - What have you got there? - Nothing Mr. Rowens. - I think we better take a trip to see the principal. - Ms. Petersen, I can't stress highly enough the dignity you must approach this assignment with. You understand of course it's, it's only an experiment. And I maybe taking my whole career in my hands in doing this. - I realize the pressures you're under. And I appreciate the opportunity given to me. There are not too many educators as enlightened as you. - I may be enlightened but if anything goes wrong I could be out of a job here. - As an educator you mustn't think of it in terms such as that. Claremont will be the first high school in the state to receive sex education on a regular basis. After all, what has a more basic need than the actual preparation for life? - Well, you'll soon learn that everybody doesn't view it in the same light. Sex to many people is something dirty, something to avoid talking about. - I've been up against that before. It's merely a matter of presenting the material in the proper manner. - I'm glad you think it's that easy. I only hope to God you're right. (knocking on door) Yes? Come in. - Mr. Markell was taking his end term exam in a very unusual manner. He thought it was an open book test. He's hidden some papers inside his shirt. - Thank you Mr. Rollins. Sit down over there, Duke. Ms. Petersen, there is something I must tend to immediately. I'll introduce you to the rest of the faculty members later on and then we can continue our discussion. - Thank you very much Mr. Rowen. - And now, about you, young man. (upbeat instrumental music) - Oh hey coach, just getting in shape. - Glad to see it, boys. Hey Tony I got some great news. Next semester I'm gonna have a lot more time to devote to the team. - How come? - Well I'm not gonna be teaching health education next semester, they're bringing in a new teacher. - New teacher? - Yes, a woman. Don't laugh, she's suppose to be very good. Some kind of experiment the principal is trying. I don't know too much about it. It's suppose to be some kind of new course. Health education being taught by a woman. That's something new. - Yeah probably some old. - I'm here to introduce Ms. Erika Petersen who will be your instructor. Now this is the first time she'll be teaching this school. And I'm expecting you to extend the same courtesy to her as you would to any of our own instructors. Especially since Ms. Petersen is also a newcomer to our country. Having recently arrived from Sweden. As many of you already know, beginning this semester Claremont High will radically be changing its health education class. From now on it'll be known as anatomical biology. The main reason for this change is because the course will be entirely directed toward the preparation for life. A study of what makes up the differences between man and woman and the various functions their bodies perform. - Yeah, man. - Alright that's enough of that. This is very serious business. You're very lucky that Mr. Lewis, our honored principal is forward enough to introduce this type of class here. Now I'm gonna let Ms. Petersen speak to you. Ms. Petersen. - Thank you Mr. Matti. I know how it is to be introduced to a new teacher. And I know it's going to be a bit difficult at first. Mr. Matti's been kind of enough to give me his role book with a brief biographical sketch on each of you. This is merely to aquant myself with you. I hope within a weeks time I shall know you all by name. Let me see, you're Tony Michaels and you like stock car racing. You're also very good at athletics. And you're Inat Litten and you like to paint during your spare time. Mr. Matti even told me that'd you like to major in art when you go to college. See I'm running already. I won't press my luck too far as I'm afraid I shall say something like Robert is interested in making his own dresses. (laughing) Alright let's settle down to business now. - Teach, you said nothing about me. I'm Duke Markell and I like girls. (laughing) - Tell me Mr. Duke Markell, if you like girls so much, why is it the girls don't like you? (gasping) As you know, part of our studies will include why boys like girls and why girls like boys. I think this will prove very educational to certain individuals in this class. The course of study here will be known as anatomical biology as Mr. Matti has already pointed out. Superficially we will study plant and animal life to learn the basics of anatomy and cell reproduction as nature has provided. More importantly though, we will study the anatomy of the human. We will learn about the nervous system, muscles, glands and organs and how they all function separately and relatedly. Sexual attraction, procreation, reproduction and finally birth will all be included in this course. In essence, this is a course of study for young adults. Two texts are required reading for this course. The first, Modelin's Basics in Human Anatomy is the best for our kind of work. In fact most colleges use it today. This will be supplemented by Cara Cola's Adult Sexual Behavior. Both these books have been ordered and we should have them for you early next week. We will also use visual aid to demonstrate the functions of the anatomical systems and organs. These will include three dimensional models, charts and film presentations. I must advise you that the film you will be seeing a few weeks from today was actually photographed under the direction of staff doctors in one of our largest metropolitan hospitals. In fact this film is shown in most medical colleges today. You will actually witness the birth process by natural method, cesarean section. And you will also see multiple births of twins and triplets. Because of the clinical nature of this film, I know some of you will not wish to view it. This is understandable. And you will be excused for that session. Our principal Mr. Lewis has agreed that the viewing of the film will be optional and that you will in no way be credit regarding its contents. However, the class is preceding the screening will prepare you for what you may expect to see. One thing more before we're interrupted by the bell, if any of you would like to do additional reading on this subject I strongly recommend Soul Search Male and Female. I'm sure your school library has a copy available. - Ms. Petersen? - [Ms. Petersen] Yes Tony? - I've already checked the library and Ms. Faller the librarian told me it wasn't available. - That's very interesting, Tony. I didn't know you knew of this book. - Well I'd like to become a doctor. In fact our family physician Dr. Wilson told me to read this book last year. - [Ms. Petersen] And Ms. Faller didn't know of the book? Well it's fairly recent, perhaps she didn't notice it in the book publishers catalog. - She knew of it. She said it was indecent for her library. (laughing) - Nonsense, at least 90% of all colleges and universities have this book in their library and as many as 50% of all high schools. I'll discuss this matter personally with Ms. Faller. (bell ringing) Oh Tony, have you a moment to spare? - Oh sure Ms. Petersen. - I brought along some of my own charts, I wondered if you could help me hang them. I can't quite reach that high. - Oh sure no problem. - [Ms. Petersen] Thank you Tony. - Are you two going dancing tonight? Arlene. - What Margaret? - Are you and Tony going to the Disco Tech tonight? - Sure. At least I think so. Let me ask Tony. Tony? Tony? - Your boyfriend the doctor, looks like he ain't gonna have much trouble with this course. - This kind of class interests him. - Would interest me too if that chick asked me to stay after school. Hey. If you're not doin' nothin' how 'bout, how 'bout getting a coco or something? Huh? - Okay. You wanna come Margaret? - No thanks. I have a late class. See you tonight. - Okay. (upbeat instrumental music) - What's the matter with you tonight? - Huh? - You listening to me? - I hear you. - You keep looking over at Duke. Maybe you should've asked him to take ya. - I asked you. - And nobody would ever know it. - I'm sorry. - Yeah.

Make up your mind, quick. - Well I came with Tony. - Forget it. - [Man] The guy's just looking for trouble. - Think I'm sitting with trouble. - Tony I'm sorry. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Look if you didn't start anything you wouldn't have to be sorry later. - Come on, let's dance. - Oh no you're not, we're going home right now. - No. - Right now! (door slamming) Come on. He wants to bring her home early so here she is. - I always know I can count on you, Tony, thanks. Would you like to step in for a Coke or something? - No thanks, I gotta get home, we got an exam tomorrow and a big game in the afternoon. - [Arlene's Dad] I wish Arlene had your attitude. She'll cram two hours before a test and that's that. You can't learn anything that way. - Please, father. - [Arlene's Dad] She doesn't like to hear it. The truth always hurts. - Please. - Okay young lady now up to your room. No TV tonight. For once you listen to your dad. Did you two have a good time? - [Tony] Yeah. Sure. - [Arlene's Dad] Doesn't sound that way. Anything wrong? - No. Now listen I gotta get home. - [Arlene's Dad] Goodnight, son. - Good morning, Ms. Faller. - Good morning, Ms. Petersen. Can I be of some assistance? - Yes, one of my students, maybe you know him, Tony Michaels told me he was unable to find Soul Search Male and Female on file here. You do have the book, don't you? - Most certainly not. - Why not Ms. Faller? It's one of the most standard texts on anatomical hygiene. - It's a filthy book. - Filthy? - Yes, filthy. I wouldn't allow one of our students to even leaf through it. The illustrations are positively vulgar. - They only show the beauty of the human body. - Teenage children are not meant to see such things. - That's just the point. These youngsters are not children any longer. Their bodies are the bodies of young adults. With all the needs and desires of young adults. - I wouldn't know about that. - Apparently not. These young people have the right to know about the facts of life. But you set yourself up to judge what people can and cannot read. This is a free country Ms. Faller. - That book has never appeared in this library and never will as long as I'm here. - Let's hope that's not too long. - They won seven games in a row, they gotta be rough. - Well they were playing lousy teams. - Let's wait here for the rest of the boys, they outta be coming along. - Come on kid, it's good for ya, come on. (chuckling) You see this is good stuff, the real thing. I mean this kinda grass is hard to get. Now you won't appreciate my offer. Now I'm only doing this because I like ya. Hey Rip, give me those pictures. Look kid, I'm gonna make you a special deal on the cigarettes and the pictures. Give me five bucks and the whole works of yours. See you can smoke the cigarette. And look at the pictures at the same time. You become a man over night. And now quit stalling and give me the five bucks. - I don't want it. - Well look you kids wanna learn the right way don't ya? - Let us go. - Well Tony learned from the pictures, didn't you Tony? You shouldn't of done that. You don't need no pictures huh, friend? You get all your litter from the Swedish broad. - I'm gonna get you. - The only thing you're gonna get is a busted head. - Come on Tony, what's keeping you? What's going on here Tony? - Nothing Mr. Matti, nothing. - [Mr. Matti] Then let's go, everybody's waiting. - Don't think this is over, Doctor. I'll be seeing you again. Real soon. (upbeat instrumental music) (engines racing) - Well what's up? Boss? - I'll tell ya what's up. You're suppose to be workin' for me. I'm not paying you to get into fights with Tony. - Just having a little fun. - It's no good for business. You being in jail ain't gonna do me no good. - Man, jail is for clowns. - Just watch your step. You're suppose to sell the stuff not take it yourself. - [Duke] I don't have to worry. - Not as long as I keep supplying you. Right, kid? - Yeah. Right. - This is the latest supply. Top quality stuff. No trouble in getting top price. - This stuff's great. - That's why you're getting $10 a load. - That's a lot of coin. - It's good stuff. You can get it. There's more from where this came. You should be able to get rid of the whole box this afternoon. (laughing) Sometimes I wonder about you. Indecently, what do you got against this kid Tony? - What I got? He thinks he's a big man. Baseball. Turning for college all the time. And that chick. - Yeah. She's really stacked. - I want that chick. - What's stopping ya? - [Duke] Nothing. Nothing. (laughing) - [Arlene's Dad] When is this going to stop? You're only taking five subjects, how can ya be failing three of them? - The teachers. - The teachers? What have the teachers got to do with it? You're the one that has to put in the effort. Do the studying, make the sacrificing. The teachers can only do so much. It's not the teachers that made you go out seven nights a week is it? - Oh father. - Don't oh father me, I'm fed up to here with you. Your mother just sits over there knitting, she's afraid to tell you anything. - I'm late. - I'm talking to you, young lady. Don't tell me about being late again. Look at you, the way you dress. Low cut blouse. Skirts above your knees. Boots. What are you suppose to be? - This is the way all the kids dress. Everybody dresses like this. - I'm not interested in everybody, I'm only interested in you. Don't you realize I'm saying this to you because we love you and don't want you to get into trouble? - You should listen to your father, he's right. - Oh I thought you had fallen asleep. - No I'm not asleep. - [Arlene's Dad] Well you raise your daughter as if you were asleep. - Henry, that was uncalled for. - How do you expect me to grow up always fighting? You talk about love, well that's the word you don't know the meaning of. I'm just his, another possession like the car or the TV. Something to show off to your friends. Well there's more to being a parent than that. - What do you know about being a parent? (car horns honking) - There's Tony, I've gotta go. - It's 7:30 now. I want you home no later than 10 o'clock. - Yes, Daddy. (elegant instrumental music) What do you think of girls who ask boys to marry them? - What brought this up? - Well we've been going together for a pretty long time. - Oh don't start that again. - Don't you like me even a little bit? - You know how much I love you. - Show me. - That's how much. - Show me some more. - It's getting late. - Tony. Show me how much you really love me. - We shouldn't be doing this. - But we love each other. That makes it alright. - Somebody might come along. - Please Tony, please. - [Tony] You're wonderful. - [Arlene] I'd stay here all night. - [Tony] You know we can't. - [Arlene] I'm always dreaming. - [Tony] That's not such a bad dream. - Hey wait a minute. There's something I forgot to get. Keep that joint low. - Don't worry, what'd you forget? - My book. My hygiene book. I left it in school. - You don't need no book, Stookey. You know how to do it. - Yeah. Yeah. I'll be back in a minute. (laughing) (grim music) (shouting) (laughing) (screaming) (men chattering) (screaming) - Dammit de mont. - Who did this? - Nobody, nobody. - I saw somebody run off. - No, no, I just slipped and fell, my heel caught on-- - Erika, tell me the truth. - Please leave me alone, I'll be alright. Where's my bag? - Come along, I'll take you home. - Thank you. (elegant instrumental music) - You should be glad that you're not pregnant, young lady. Most of the girls that come here are expecting and that means trouble. Trouble for them and trouble for the babies. A child needs love and attention. And it can't get it from a mother alone. - And I'm not pregnant. - But I've already told you that. - Are you sure? - I've been a doctor for 28 years. I think I can tell. - I'm not pregnant, not even a little bit? - Young lady, there is no such thing as being a little bit pregnant. - [Boss] You down there, Horus? - Yeah. I'm down here. - Horus. We got a little job for you to do. - What kind of a job? - It's something you should like real good. - These are yours. Free. - What do you want me to do? - Very simple. I got some pictures in my pocket. I want you to place them in that new teacher's desk. - Ms. Petersen? - That's her name. - Now you won't have any trouble? - Don't tell me how to do my job, kitten. - Now don't start anything, either of you. - Just keep this kid away from me. - Now that's it, both of you. I got enough trouble with the lessons she's teaching and those fancy text books they're handing out. The kids ain't got much use for my kind of literature. We'll soon get her wagon fixed. - Tony I wanna talk to you. - [Tony] Okay. - It's not okay, come out from under that car. - [Tony] I'm in the middle of the job. You can talk, there's nobody else in the garage. - Tony, it's important, come out from under there right now. - [Tony] No, look, I told you before, I'm very busy, can't you see? - Tony. I'm pregnant. - What? - I'm pregnant. - You feeling alright? Sit down. When did you find out? - Today. I just came from the doctor's office. - Holy cow. - We gotta do something. - Do, what can we do? I mean an abortion? - We've got to get married. - Married? I'd have to leave school, drop out. No college. Holy cow, don't cry. Listen we can work it out. Ah don't cry, you're making me feel bad. Look. Let me get cleaned up, we'll get out of here. Wait right here I'll be back in half a minute. - I'm pregnant. - [Margaret] What? - That's why I'm running away from home. - How long have you known? - A week. - What about your parents? - I couldn't tell them, they're in another world. - [Margaret] Where you gonna go? - I don't know. - You sure this is the best way? - It's the only way. - What do you want me to do? - Nothing, just promise you won't tell anyone. Margaret, promise. - I promise. Do you need any money? - How much can you spare? - $10? - That's all? - It's my whole weeks allowance. - Thanks. But you can't get far on $10. Guess I'll have to hitch. (suspenseful music) - You running away from home or something? - Yeah. I run away from home every Thursday night. - Pretty smart. (phone ringing) - Hello? Telephone Arlene. Telephone! Arlene, telephone! I'm not your secretary! - Henry, stop shouting. The neighbors. - I don't give a hay about the neighbors. Where is that girl? I gave her expressed instructions not to leave this room. This is the last straw. - But she's probably staying with one of her girlfriends for the evening. - Well she's coming right back home. I'm going to make a few calls of my own. I'll find out where she is. - I didn't wanna sound inquisitive but, how far you going kid? - What's your last stop? - California. - That's how far I'm going. - No Mr. Taylor. I haven't seen her since yesterday at school. Yeah I'm sure. No, don't call the police. - Now tell me the truth young lady. - Look maybe I better come over. I don't think I can talk about it on the phone. (engine racing) - You think it's easy traveling the roads? - I'll get by. - And what about your parents? - They're dead. - You all alone then? - Now I am. - There's a truck stop north tell about two miles down the road. You get some food and rest there. - Rest? - Yeah. Rest. - [Henry] I want the truth. Why did she run off? - I don't know how to tell you. - Out with it girl! - Arlene is pregnant. - I knew this would happen. I just knew it. - Are you sure? - She told me tonight. - Who's the boy? Tony? It's that teacher. - What? - That Ms. Petersen or whatever her name is. All that hygiene talk at school. That's what did it. - That's unfair about the teacher. - Well why can't I say it, it's true isn't it? First, I'm gonna call the police to find our daughter. She couldn't of gone too far. Then I'm gonna call a special meeting of the town council to take care of that Ms. Erika Petersen and her sex education class. (upbeat instrumental music) - Well, what have we here? - Hello Duke. - What's a girl like you doing in a nice place like this? - What do you got in there, your lunch? - I'm running away from home. - Well isn't that nice? - I'm not kidding. - Finally smartened up huh? - I've had it. - Parents huh? - Parents, school, Tony. - Why Tony? Well how come you didn't run to him when you decided to split? - Well you wouldn't believe this but I came here by accident. - Now come on, you could think of a better story than that. You've been making a play for me every time I see you. Want something to eat? - I'm not hungry. - That sounds a lot like to me you do. - Hey Duke. You wanna catch the drive in? - You bet Duke, I checked before they got back in town, we can all get in. - Yeah the Sean Gurlahn Chain Gang. - They're suppose to be a pretty hot show. Wanna be on my chain gang? Okay let's go. - Hey. And what about your check? - [Duke] Stick it. - Good you could get here so fast, Tony. We have a serious problem on our hands. - I came as soon as I got your message. Did you hear anything more about Arlene? - Not yet but I've got the police looking. - How far of a head start does she have Mr. Taylor? - Not much, an hour, maybe two. She couldn't of gone too far. My guess is she's staying with one of her other girlfriends all safe and sound. - I'm worried about her, Mr. Taylor. She seemed pretty upset these couple of days. She may of done something drastic. - I know my own daughter, boy. She's safe and sound, just like I said. Now you go find her and bring her back here. I'm sure her testimony will prove to be mighty conclusive evidence. - Okay mister, I'll find her. - Good. - How do you like the show? - It's okay. - You don't sound too happy. Well maybe it's the company. Hey you ain't being too friendly to your new boyfriend. Something tells me it's gonna be a long evening. - Mr. Blaire? Have you seen any of Arlene's girlfriends tonight? - No kid's been in tonight, Tony. The place is dead and I'm about ready to close for the night. Have an important town meeting to attend. - You didn't see Arlene tonight did ya? - Oh now that you mention it I seem to recall her walking by my window. Yeah, that's right about, two hours ago. - Which way was she headed? - Oh that way, it seems as she was heading for the highway. - Thanks Mr. Blaire. - [Ben] Are we going to let this happen again? - Settle down, Ben. Gettin' all hot and bothered ain't gonna help things any. - Teaching that kind of stuff in a school's like teaching about the devil right in church. - Now let's not get excited. Cool heads are needed at a time like this. - Who are you to talk Lewis? You're the real one to blame. You brought this teacher here. - Yes I brought her here. That's true and I would do it again. - And you defend what you did? - Mr. Taylor, if your daughter became pregnant it wasn't because of anything she had read in a book. - Is that suppose to be funny? - No it wasn't meant to be a joke. We can teach them only so much in the schools. The rest comes from the home, the family. That's where a child really learns the difference between right and wrong. - Hey Vladimir, have you seen Arlene? - Who? - Sorry, I'm a little bit on edge. - Well don't take it out on me. You're the one who decided to run away from home, nobody forced you. - They all forced me. - Now listen, everybody's beginning to look over here. Don't make a fool out of Duke Markell or you'll be sorry. Arlene. - [Arlene] I wanna get out of here. - You better have your walking shoes on baby. - Just continue to watch the show, folks. She ain't gettin' very far. - Hey I don't suppose you've seen Arlene tonight have you? - Arlene? No. Oh yeah I see her early evening. - Yeah well, who she with? - I don't remember. - What do you mean you don't remember? She was here right? So who was she with. - She was with Duke, his friends, I don't know. - Duke. Now where'd they go? - How would I know? They went that way over drive in some place. - The drive in, you sure now? - Yeah I'm sure. - Thanks a lot, Ben. (horns honking) - [Man] Hey, come here! (horns honking) - Hey. Look who's decided to show. (horns honking) Come on baby, do a dance for us. Oh you like to dance. First you gotta pass the initiation test. - [Arlene] Get away from me. (upbeat instrumental music) - [Man] Come on Duke! - Come on Duke, come on! - Get him, come on, go, go! - [Man] Come on Duke! - Come on Duke. - [Man] Get him, come on, don't let him do that. - Come on Duke! - Get him, get him! - Come on Duke, come on. - Get him, go, get him, go! - [Man] Come on Duke! - [Man] Come on Duke. - [Man] Get him, come on don't let him do that. - Are you alright? - I think so. Tony, I've done a terrible thing. - Don't talk now, wait 'till I get you home. - No. I've gotta tell you. - What is it? - I told everybody I was gonna have a baby. - I know, your father told me. - No listen. I'm not pregnant. - You're not pregnant? - I was crazy. I wanted to scare you, my parents, Ms. Petersen. I was jealous of her and you. I thought I was losing you and I thought it was the only way I could make you love me. By being pregnant. - Arlene, you know I love you. - Not the way I want you to. - I think you've done more harm then you're aware of. - What do you mean? - Right now with the town meeting going on and Ms. Petersen is on trial. - She had no right going into an area that's essentially a medical problem. - You use the word problem. There is no problem. Only you make the problem. For young people to learn about themselves, their bodies, this is no problem. We teach them about the heart, the lungs. These are parts of the body. Why not about the parts of the body that all future life is dependent on? Only for learning can they understand the responsibility. - Only through learning? The janitor Horus while cleaning came across these in your desk, is this part of your course? - I don't know what you're talking about. - Yeah well look at these, Bob. - Disgraceful. - Take them away. - Have you seen enough, Judge? - You better burn them. - Pornography. - Well I'm glad you know what you're selling. They were found in your desk. - I don't know who put them there. - You put them there yourself. - That's a lie. Wait a minute, what were you doing in my desk the other day? - What about the movie? - Yes, there's the case of the motion picture film. - That's what the girl Margaret was telling me about. - Let's run the film. - Let me interrupt you gentlemen before continuing your little trial. This film was made in one of our large metropolitan hospitals. It shows the birth of a child from natural methods, cesarean section and the birth of twins. It was made by doctors for doctors. - Then why have the film in your possession? - Strictly for educational purposes. - [Henry] Show the film. Bob, get the lights. - [Narrator] We will now proceed to demonstrate the motusapprandi of the universial obstractical forceps. The blades are introduced by the direct method along the desired line of application on the fetal head. The handles are locked together at a certain moment to make possible the articulation of the universal joint. The blades have been locked underhead thus the initial grasp is maintained throughout the entire operation. The universal joint is articulated permitting extraction in any desired direction. When traction is applied the head with the blades and the spear of the joint can singulusly can advance in the path of least resistance. The blades are introduced in the manner just shown. The branches of the instrument are locked following by the closing of the blades on the fetal head. In more than 200 deliveries with the universal forceps there was no selfestes or extensions of the biplosodomy. We noticed only an occasional minor nuclosa abrasion. The fetal surface of the braid is bevel and scooped to promote a grip adaptation of the fetal head and to eliminate the so called pressure points. This new instrument can be easily taken apart for cleaning and sterilizing by opening the handle plate and separating the two branches of the forceps by turning a knob on the fital dog to split universal jointers open and the blade can be disconnected. To connect the blades through the handle, the hemisphere of the joint is placed on the socket and engaged so it becomes flush with the socket. The joint is articulated and traction applied in the direction to favor extension. When the interior frontinal appears at the posterior promisure of the vulva, the blades are opened and removed. I want to correct thew false visual impression created in the picture that a strong traction force is required in these cases. The forces applied is in the plane of least resistance and is much less than that required with the rigid forceps. The head is delivered. The rest of the delivery is accomplished in the usual manner. The baby weighing nine pounds, two ounces. This new obstetical forceps is designed to meet and satisfy all the essential requirements of the universal obstetical forceps. These requirements are, one aqua bacteriological application, two, extraction in all positions. Three, minimal compression of the fetal head and four, prevention of trauma by the forceps for mother and baby. - That's what you're learning in school? - These films were not yet shown. As the classes are planned out well in advance, this film was scheduled to be shown in three weeks time. - And what would the children have learned by seeing the film? - They would've seen the beauty and purity of the reproductive system. There is nothing wrong with that. I don't care so much that I am on trial here. But not what I'm teaching. These films were not intended for large meetings or stag shows. They're for the education of all. We always have a great fear of what we do not know. The fear of the unknown. Education is the only thing that can change that. Mr. Taylor, how much did you and your wife tell your daughter about the facts of life when she became of age? - Well. - You don't have to answer. Apparently you told her nothing. Was it because you didn't know? Were you embarrassed or ashamed? You didn't know how to tell her. Then it is you who have committed the greatest crime of all. The crime of ignorance. You're an intelligent and successful business man. But in the most basic lesson of all you have failed. If parents were able to and did prepare their children for life and all that that means, then the rate of illegitimacy that has grown 10 fold in the last seven years would all but disappear. That is why the schools must take over. Because parents are either afraid or don't know how or for some reason or other keep their children in the dark. And let them make their own tragic mistakes. Would you rather your child learned about sex and life in a school room under proper supervision? Or in the back seat of a car at a drive in? The choice is yours. - [Arlene] I'm not pregnant. - Oh my little girl. Are you sure? - It's a good thing I found her in time. Duke and the raiders were closing in on her. - That bunch should be put away. - I'm calling Sheriff Nickels to bring them in for questioning. - Better get that creep Kaplan too, that's where he gets his orders. - We'll bring em' all in. Horus, not so fast. We have a few questions to ask you about some photographs. - Horus? - Yeah? - I think you'd better start looking for a new job. - Yeah. - You gave us quite a scare young lady. - It'll never happen again. - I hope not, it's nothing to fool around with. - I don't wanna go through that again. - Ms. Petersen, I wanna apologize. - That's not necessary. - She's a brave woman. - You're right. Like someone once said, it took a woman to show us the light.
