[birds chirping] [footsteps marching] - [Johnny] Halt! What's your name boy? - [Watkins] Private Watkins, sir! - [Johnny] Front and center Private Watkins! If we were in enemy territory, you would be dead because you're standing on a live mine. That's right men. This is a mine field, but it's a dummy mine field. But we're gonna treat it like it's real. Now sometimes mines are placed in certain patterns... [mine clicks] [birds chirping] Live mine dive for cover! - [O'Malley] Looks like you got yourself into a hell of a problem, boy. - You let me step on a live mine? - Especially if it were to go, only when you step off. All you have to do is replace the safety pin. [birds chirping] [grass rustles] - Private Watkins. - [Watkins] Sir! - You and the men, bring your flack jackets. Lay 'em around. [mine explodes] - [O'Malley] Good boy. I knew you could do it all the time. [punch thuds] I'll bust you for this Johnny Barrows! I'll have you kicked out of the service. You hear me? You hear me, I'll have you kicked out of the service. [melodic funk music] [horn honks] [shouts] [groans] [punches thud] [Johnny shouts] - [Mugger] Let's go! [door slams] - Hold it right there. - Another stinking drunk. You know that's what I hate about this beat. - [Officer] Any ID? - [Officer] What's your name boy? He can't hear. Where you going? - [Officer] You had too much to drink, ya fella? - [Officer] Where you been? - [Officer] What's your name? - [Officer] Hey come on, we're talking to you! - Why don't you tell us who you are boy? Come on fella, too much to drink. Come on, empty your pockets. What do we got here? - Well would you look at these. One of these is the Silver Star. - Well. Where did you get these from? - [Officer] You better start talking before he gets angry. You got your discharge papers? - Start talking, dammit, or I'll split your skull wide open. Now where'd you steal these from? Huh? Look I'm talking to you. Where did you get these from? Talk dammit! I'm talking to you boy. Alright you dirty bastard. I'll break your ass in two. - [Officer] Hold it. - [Officer] He's resisting an officer. - What'd you book him on? - [Officer] 502. - 502? If he's drunk then what the hell's holding him up? - [Officer] Well when we first brought him in he was pretty... - Now go on, write it up in your report. I'll take it from here. Hey I know you. You're... Yeah, it's football. Johnny? Yeah, Johnny Barrows. Johnny Barrows. Boy I'll never forget that game with State. The one where you ran it back 95 yards for a touchdown. I was there. Boy what a game. You were really great. Johnny Barrows. All-State high school football star. At two years of college, he was on his way to becoming an All-American a few years back, when all of a sudden he up and left town because of a scandal involving a co-ed. Next time I heard about Johnny Barrows I read in the paper how he single-handedly took on the whole Vietcong army. Welcome home Johnny.

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Theodore Rasputin Waterhouse, professor of philosophy, retired of course. My friends simply call me the Professor. What did you say your name was? - Johnny Barrows. - Barrows? Johhny Barrows. Well it's obvious to the naked eye that you ain't been on the bum for too long Johnny Barrows. Follow me. - Where we going? - An inquisitive mind. It's the first prerequisite to an education. I like that quality in you, we is headed to the soup line. Now the first thing you've got to remember, is that if you wanna be a bum, you gotta stay healthy, hear me? I do not eat out of garbage cans. I am catered to at the soup line. I don't ever smoke, and I take a daily stroll for my exercise. Although I have been known to take a sip of vino every now and then. Now are we gonna make our move, or are we gonna make our move? Now when we arrive we're gonna have to listen to a sermon about how our souls are all headed for damnation, and then we will be indulged in a gourmet meal which if you have an imagination, can be oxtail soup, potato pancakes, pheasant on the glass. Come right over here, now this young man looks likes he's not satisfied with this. I thought you wanted it with nothing on it, not with everything on it. Now you don't wanna get stains on that shirt, do you? Have a bite of this, my man, this is fresh stuff, real fresh. - That's pretty good. - Then get back and get another. What are we drinking here, root beer? Haven't I seen you? This must be a public relations body. [laughs] You got it right, a public relations body. Well now how's about now, public relations work down here ain't been too good, how's about buying us a couple of dogs with kraut. On this fella here in the lollipop shirt. It's a lollipop shirt. - Is that what that is? - Yeah he's heading down for salvation with us. [laughs] - He's heading somewhere. Shall we take him with us? You bring that coke? - Yes, as good as ever. You come with us now. We're taking you in. [engines rumbling] - [Don Da Vince] Hey Carlo. Tell him to hurry up with the sign, it should've been up by now. - [Carlo] I'll take care of it pop. Hey what's taking you assholes so long? What do you think we're paying you for? - [Don Da Vince] Carlo! Don't talk dirty. How many times I have to tell ya. I don't like it. You see your big brother. In his own way he gets things done. [laughs] - Yes Poppa. - Hey Tony, Tony, Tony. You know, all the time I think you soft when you're messing around with the flowers. In my own mind I think you have no interest in my business. And then you come up with this idea. It's the perfect set-up for operations. - Yes Poppa. - God has been good to me. I am blessed to have two such wonderful sons. - Poppa look, what about the Racconi family? - What about the Racconi family? I do nothing against them. I'm a businessman. I open a new business. I sell flowers, alright? - Right. - What is not right is that Don Racconi tries to tell me what I can do, what I cannot do. Carlo! - [Carlo] Yeah Pop? - Come here please. - You want me Poppa? - Your brother Tony is worried about the Racconi family. - Hey. - What's the matter Tony? - He thinks we should be afraid of the big Racconi family. - Hey Tony. You afraid? - No I am not afraid. I just said that with a bit they could be some trouble. - Hey look, you run the flower shop, I'll take care of the trouble, right Poppa? - Right Carlo. My baby boy. Maybe he's afraid he'll get his green thumb dirty. [laughs] - Hey Poppa, let me show you the operation. - Alright. [melodic funk music] - Johnny! - [Bum] Hey look it there. - [Nancy] Johnny Barrows! Johnny! I wanna talk to you. - [Bum] She must be out doing her shopping today, huh? - [Bum] That's nice. - [Bum] She's looking for that turkey. - Get in. Mario wants to talk to you. [overlapping exclamations and whistling] [engine rumbles] - So how you feeling Johnny? - I'm alright. - That's good. Look my father, he'd like to talk to you. - If it's about the same thing we talked about before Mario... - Now hold on, hold on Johnny. Just listen to his offer, okay? You see the Da Vince family, they're giving us some trouble. [chuckles] They're trying to move into LA. But whatever you do, don't interrupt my father when he talks. You listen. He'll tell you when you can speak. - [Don Racconi] Come in, come in. Have a seat, Mr. Barrows. California's a long way from New York, but not far enough for me to get rid of my troubles with some people. Thought the old days were behind us. Mr. Barrows. How much are you worth? - I don't know, about $100,000. [laughs] [Don Racconis speaking in Italian] - Mario here, he tells me you have killed many men. Good, I will pay you your worth, but, if you do or do not accept my offer, your lips must be sealed about anything you hear or see, or your life is meaningless, you understand that? You want to say something, say, talk. - I was a soldier when I killed those men Mr. Racconi. - And you are what now? - I'm a civilian. - A man must do what he must do. Goodbye Mr. Barrows. - Nancy will take you wherever you want to go. - You know some of them have been loyal to the family for 40 years, some of them more. [speaks in Italian] - That's a long time. - Not for family. Family goes on, even after death. Family takes care of it's own. Yeah we have trust now, lawyers, CPAs. We're a business now. - What do we do if Da Vince moves in? [laughs] - You know, when we were boys, he was always full of tricks, Da Vince. Now that he's an old man he's a master of tricks. Son of a bitch. Maybe this is where your Johnny Barrows comes in? - He says he didn't wanna play. - He says no, then you say yes. No, then you say yes, yes, again, and again, until you get what you want. Capiche? - Capiche. - But for now I think we're gonna go with our old friend Antonio Goti. [melodic funk music] - It's your decision Johnny. - How do you measure a man's worth Nancy? Is it by what he owns? His dreams, or what he wants from life? My dreams are small. A home. Some land. Something I can own that nobody can ever take away from me. - What you want, it's not that much different from what I want. I'd like to get away from all of this too. - I'll think about it Nancy, but I'll have to try it my way first. - Good luck. - You tell Mario thanks. [melodic funk music] You the manager? - Yeah. - I need a job. - Lots of people need a job fella. What can you do? - I don't know, I guess I can pump gas or something. - Lot more to pumping gas than it seems, well you'll be handling money. How much education you got? - About two years college. - How come you didn't finish? - I went to Vietnam. - Let me see your discharge papers. - Hey can't you just see how I work out first? - What's the matter? You got a dishonorable discharge? - Yeah. - Having trouble finding a job, huh? - Okay man, alright, I get the message. - Wait a minute. I'll give you a job. - Oh yeah? - One goof up, and you're fired, you understand? - Yeah, yeah, I understand. Where do I start? - Well you clean out the johns first, and when you get through with that I want this garage floor scrubbed until there's not a spot left. Then I got a couple cars out back you can wash up. What you waiting for? [melodic funk music] [water running] ♪ He was just ♪ Just another hero ♪ In the streets ♪ The Silver Star ♪ What was it for ♪ Hero ♪ He was a hero ♪ Hero ♪ He was a hero - Hey I've been here about a week now, when do I start pumping gas? - Whenever I get ready for you to. I'll let you know. - You ain't giving me the runaround are you? - Listen. I'm giving you a place to sleep. You're lucky to be working here. You don't like it, quit. Now you're doing a good job, cleaning up. Now why don't you go on back to work? - Now when do I get paid? - Oh you college kids, you're just alike. "When do I get paid?" Don't worry, I'll pay you. [water sloshes] - Soon as that crazy clown came out here, the sun stops. Must be Joe, isn't it? - Bad news Pop. Da Vince's moved in. He's opened up a flower shop to cover his operation. [chuckles] - So the master of tricks has made his move. Against my warning, son of a bitch. - We gotta do something. - No, no, no, no. We don't do these kind of things no more. Mario. You go find Antonio Goti, say to him, Antonio Goti, Don Racconi says for you to come. He will know. Now. If you come back it'll be waiting for you. [speaking in Italian] [engine rumbles] So. Now you know. Yes he has moved in. I gave him warning. But in spite of my warning, he made the move, this comedian with his disgusting tricks. Antonio Goti. Who knows better than you, what must be done. [melodic funk music] - Hi may I help you? - Yeah I'll have a dozen roses. - I'll fix them up real nice for you. - Thanks. That'll be nice. Oh is Carlo Da Vince here? - Yeah, he's in the back. I'll get him for you. - Thanks. - [Richard] Hey, hey. What the hell you think this is, a hotel? - Hey I'm sorry man, I must have overslept. - I ain't paying you to sleep, get a move on. You supposed to have the water on, the coffee hot and ready. - Yeah, yeah, I know man. - Well then get the lead out, get to work, hurry. - Hey I was kind of hoping today you'd give me a chance to change some oil, or give a lube job or something. - Yeah well, well, we'll see. Right now, you get that coffee hot. Get it ready! And when you finish that clean the restroom. - I already cleaned the restroom. - [Richard] Well then clean them again. Or dump the trash, or do something. Get to work dammit. Yeah. Okay, okay, okay. Alright. [horn honks] Right. [horn honks] Hey. Oh no you don't! - Hey hero. How you doing? - I'm hanging on. - Good. You remember Nancy here, don't you? - Yeah, hi Nancy, how you doing? - Just great, working man. - Yeah, you got yourself a messy job here don't you? [horn honks] - Yeah, but it's honest. - Yeah. [laughs] You gotta do things the hard way, don't ya Johnny? - You need any gas? - [Mario] Who's this creep? - That's the owner. - Beat it, while I talk to Johnny here. Johnny the big hero, huh? Yeah. What are you doing working in a place like this? - I need the money. - If you wanted just a flunkie job, why didn't you come to work for me at the restaurant? - Thanks Mario, but the answer's still no. - [Mario] You're a stubborn man hero. You're really stubborn. Chauffeur, get me out of here. - Bye Johnny. [engine rumbles] - Somebody brought you flowers Poppa. - For me? - Yes. - Who are they from? - They didn't say. - Antonio loved roses. Now he sleeps with roses. Da Vince family. [groans] - Leave it! Call Da Vince. Set up a meeting at once. - But Poppa. He killed Antonio. We gotta hit back! - No, no, no. This is exactly what he will be expecting me to do. You do as I say. [melodic funk music] - They know what they done to Racconi. [speaking in Italian] I know you have called this meeting because you feel we can settle our differences, and I agree. I have chosen this place because it is sacred ground, we both have people buried here. Here our word must be sacred, huh? - I agree Don Da Vince, I agree. I have much respect for this ground, it's good that we should settle our differences, here, in this place, I agree. - Good. Now we can talk. This new business I have started I can make lots of money dealing to the Blacks and the Chicanos. - Da Vince you know... I do not like what you've got in your mind to do. - [Don Da Vince] I know how you think, but what difference can it make to these people? - [Don Racconi] They are people. Like you, like me. Wouldn't want anyone selling dope to your own kids would you? - Then... Your answer's no, huh? - Yes my answer is no. - You will not change your mind? Buena notte Don Racconi. - Buena notte. [melodic funk music] [gunshot fires] [gunshots fire] [screams] [gunshots fire] [engine rumbling] - What do you want? - It's pay day. - Told you I'd pay you. - It's just $21 man, what is this for? I've been here almost a month. - What's your beef? I only took out for the parts money you claim you lost. Besides you drank too many soda pops, and you take too many coffee breaks. - Coffee breaks? Man, janitors make more than this. - Listen you... I wouldn't trust you near my gas pumps, or my cash register, I docked you for standing out there talking to your friend. Yeah the one that called me a creep. - [Officer] Looks like Richard's having trouble. Let's check it out. - Now you take your check and get the hell out of here. You're fired. - I ain't leaving till I get the rest of my money. - Out! [dramatic funk music] [tires screech] [cans clatter] [groans] Thank you boys. [labored breathing] - Mario? Mario? Mario, it's Nancy. [labored breathing] - Nancy. Come closer. I want you to get Johnny. Get him. And tell him... To come here. To the hospital. Tell him... It'll mean a lot of money for him. Huh? - [Nancy] I'll tell him. - And tell him. - Yes Mario. I'll tell him. [labored breathing] - Go on. [labored breathing] - Excuse me, I'm sorry, but you'll have to leave now. - Alright. Thank you for letting me see him. - Alright Johnny, come on out of there. Hey Johnny, I'm talking to you. Alright so you're hard of hearing. But get this. You're free to go. You must know some pretty important people. Someone upstairs says let you go. And it's strange how that guy you beat up all of a sudden changes his mind about pressing charges. Please Mr. Barrows, a lady is waiting. [melodic funk music] - Thank you. - Did they hurt you Johnny? - They did. I don't feel it now. - Oh Johnny it's horrible. - What are you talking about? - You haven't heard about Mr. Racconi and Mario. - No, what happened? - The Da Vince family. Shot them down like dogs. Mr. Racconi's dead. - Mario? - He took so many hits, it's a wonder he's even alive. He wants to see you Johnny. It could mean a lot of money for you. - I can't Nancy. I just can't. You understand, don't you? - Yeah. - Alright, let's go. [melodic funk music] [engine rumbles] - Mario it's me. I brought Johnny. - Ugly, huh? - Mario, how you feeling? - Feel rotten. Nancy. Go do some paperwork or something. I wanna talk. - Sure. - Come closer Johnny. It's hard for me to talk. What do you want more than anything else? - I don't know Mario, maybe to own something. A piece of land maybe. - I'm offering you $100,000. And the choicest piece of land you'd ever want. - What do I have to do? Kill somebody? - Just give me what I want. I want you to kill the Da Vince family. How much they pay in the army? 87.50 a month? - Yeah, but that was different Mario, that was war. - That's bullshit, same thing. This is a family of maggots. They're not human. They killed my Poppa. I want 'em dead. And I know every hit man in the country, you hear me? That's why this job's gonna be easy for you. - $100,000 and a piece of land, huh? - Uh-huh. Now listen to this. That family of upright citizens, they run a flower shop, and they're supplying dope to the Black and the Mexican communities. You not only will be getting rid of some scum for me, but you'll be doing a favor to your own people. Now believe me Johnny, the only vice me and my Pop ever ran through this community was numbers. We made our money in restaurants, wineries, and linens. You hear me? Now we tried to keep the dope out. We tried Johnny. We really tried. [sighs] Now what do you think Johnny? Will you do it for me? - I don't know Mario, I'll think about it. - Well I want you to do it real quick. You can get in touch with me through Nancy. - Yeah. - Okay you give it some good thought. [labored breathing] [somber funk music] [laughs] - There. - I want you to send some flowers to Mario Racconi. - Sure Poppa, what shall I put on the card? - Rest in peace. There will be another day. Our deepest sympathies, the Da Vince's. - Oh that's very original Poppa. - Terrific Poppa. - Now. Down to serious business. This girl, Nancy. I want somebody to talk to her, I have a feeling she's running things while Mario's in the hospital, getting over his cold. - Yeah. He got so many holes in his ass, he got a draft on the inside. [laughs] - Hey. Don't talk dirty. You know I don't like it, huh? - I'm sorry Poppa. - I want you to find her, get to her. I don't want her messing up things. - I'll take care of her. - Hey, but Poppa. Let me take care of that. Please. - Alright Tony. Alright. Alright so much for this business. Your Mama's waiting at the church. You know how she hates to be kept waiting. Come on, let's go. - [Mario] Relax, you. My men are out there searching for her, they'll come up with something. Words out on the street that she was picked up by Carlo Da Vince. - I feel helpless. I don't like being in here, while she's out there. - [Mario] How do you think I feel? - I tell you Mario. They harm her, they'll have to answer to me. - [Mario] That's the killer instinct. It's coming back, huh hero? [laughs] Money wouldn't do it, but love will. - Cut the crap, will ya? - [Mario] Now how about my offer? - I'm thinking about it. - Good, you keep on thinking. [phone rings] - Yeah? - [Nancy] Johnny? It's Nancy. - Nancy! - Nancy? How is she? - Are you okay baby? - Yeah, I'm okay. - They did what? - So sickening what they made me do. - You just take it easy Nancy, huh? Just take care. I'll be over later. - Does that help make up your mind? - [Tony] That was good baby. That was real good. You almost made me believe you. - Just keep on believing me. And we'll have everything we ever wanted. [laughs] Once we get everybody out of the way, it'll be all free for us. The hero. Just be ready to play ball. [laughs] - There's 10 G's in there. And some information on Tony Da Vince. Now you don't come back here for nothing if you bumped him off. The cops are gonna be watching me for some information. [laughs] They don't know it, but they're gonna be my best protection. You staying close with Nancy, huh? There's an address on the back of that envelope. You can pick up all the hardware you need from there. - Balls. - What's your problem Bear? - He's just a little nervous. - Just waiting around, it's starting to get next to me. - Come on, I'll play another hand of Gin. - [Bear] I'm sick and tired of playing cards. - I'm going home, I promised Mama I'd take her some flowers. See ya later. Ciao. - See ya Tony. - [Body Guard] See ya Tony. - It's been slow around here anyway. [melodic funk music] - Hey Bear, come on in the back and help me with that funeral arrangement. - Do I have to? - [Carlo] Yeah. - [Bear] Those things, they give me the creeps. - [Body Guard] Go ahead, give him a hand. It's only flowers. - Oh yeah, only flowers, huh? Then why the hell don't you help him? - I'm playing solitaire. - Come on Bear, come on. - [Bear] Ah shit. [gunshot fires] [groans] What the hell? - Check the front. - Carlo Da Vince. [gunshot fires] [flower pots clatter] - Oh no. No. Oh no. - Is that all you have to say for yourself? - Yes my Don. - Up to now you have been a good and faithful servant. - I have my Don. - You know. You have cost me the life of my oldest son. - But I... [heavy breathing] - His mother won't speak to me. She is like walking dead. - I'm sorry my Don. - Destroy yourself. Use your own gun. - [Bear] But... [hair dryer blows] [phone rings] - Hello? - Hey listen baby, I'm gonna leave town for a couple of weeks. The hero is getting too close. Now I'll be in Mexico if you need me, by then you should have gotten the job done, and then we can take care of him. - Okay Tony. I'll keep you posted. - Okay, Louie, you can shove off as soon as you want. I'm going to get some sleep, it's going to be a long trip. - Okay. You bring the charts with you? - But they're down below. Look don't you wake me for anything, I tell ya, I'm bushed. - Yeah, we should get to Mexico early tomorrow. - You better believe it. [boat engine rumbles] [buoy bell clangs] [dramatic funk music] [gun thuds] - [Tony] Hey! [muffled groans] [gasps] Who are you, what do you want? Where's Louie, what do you want? - Hello lover. So you like beating women, huh? - Now what do you... What have you done to Louie? Hey! [groans] [groans] Do you know who I am? I'm Tony Da Vince, of the Da Vince family. - Thank you. I'm glad to know I got the right man Mr. Da Vince. I got a contract to kill you. - How much is it for? I'll... Double it. What... What are you gonna do? - Well... Since you like screwing so much, I think I'll just throw your ass in the sea, maybe some fish will bite it off. [screams] [gasps] - You're inhuman. - Jump. - No! [gun cocks] - Jump. - I can't swim! [shouts] [water splashes] [dramatic ambient music] - It had to be Mario. Who else, huh? I'm asking you who else would want to kill my two sons? Who else? - Well who's doing it for him? I've checked around, there's no contract out. Unless they brought somebody new in. - You should've seen their Mama. When I told her about her baby boy Tony... She didn't even cry. I tried to talk to her. All she could say, over and over, "I have no more tears for my sons." Now you stay near me. Don't let me out of your sight. - Yes, my Don. - I'm going to get Armor in on this. - [Body Guard] That's big money, my Don. - Armor? - [Armor] Who wants to know? - Don Da Vince. You available? - [Armor] Yeah. - [Don Da Vince] Okay, where do we find you? - [Armor] 50 grand in advance. I'll check into the Tower. Have someone meet me in the morning with the money. When I get it, I'll call you. - Nancy? Yeah. It's done. You meet me tomorrow. Bring the information. Same place. Bye. [thunder rumbles] [dramatic funk music] [engine rumbles] [tires screech] [tires screech] [metal crunches] You hold it right there. You won't be making any deliveries today. - Hey what's this all about man? I mean, I only work here, you know? - I'll ask the questions. Is Mr. Da Vince in there? - No, no he's not.
