Careful. Balance... Bassoons... Softer, softer. - Hello? - Sweetie Pie... Honey, I told you never to call me here. I know, but it's an emergency. I need to find 20 "guests" for tomorrow. Most of my regulars are playing mourners at a wake. The pay is better. Filipov! You've got the wrong number! Andrei Semionovich Filipov! You are banned from watching the orchestra rehearse. - You're a janitor! - I know. Sorry, Leonid Dimitrievich... - But, you said, I could... - No, no, no! Follow me. This is how you clean the Bolshoi? We had a deal. You may not watch rehearsal unless this office is spotless. It will be. CHATELET THEATRE, PARIS MESSAGE DELETED Erased! Never existed! Good luck finding your email now, asshole. I've got to land the Genkin wedding. He wants 1,000 guests. - Genkin's a gangster. - They all are. Better dressed, and with kids studying in London. But they're still gangsters. So what? 1,000 guests! Just think... He knows 200 people, tops. He'll need us to find at least 800 extras. We'll make enough to buy some land in the country. We could grow our own vegetables. We spend a fortune on them. Our taxes went up this year, and so did the rent. And the grocery charges 3 rubles a potato! It's unbelievable! We'll sell the piano. We will not sell the piano. Genkin must have a bigger reception than the one Makarov had. - To prove his balls are bigger. - Ira! Can you help me find some extras? Yes, Sasha. Any luck? You're an angel! You've saved my life! What do you mean? You said, you'd get 19. Right, OK. See you later. Sweetie Pie... I know you're tired, but I need one more "guest." I'll come. Let me get changed. Every day, they make new promises... 28, 29, 30! You asked for 30, I delivered 30. Now you pay for 30. Look, Irina, how about a package deal? 500 for each extra, plus a 100-ruble bonus, and you all come back next Sunday. 600 for two Sundays, OK? No way, Gavrilov! It's the same rate every Sunday. 400 rubles per head per protest. - Have you no loyalty to the party? - I never did. You and your party can go to hell! I want the 12,000 rubles you owe me. Right now! MOSCOW MUSICIANS' UNION HALL Come on, Andrei. Have a swig. It won't kill you. Come on, Andrei! You're still our leader, aren't you? - No! - You heard him! Come with me. Read this. To Mr. Leonid Vinichenko, Director of the Bolshoi. Dear Mr. Vinichenko, it appears from your website that your Orchestra may be available in two weeks, on June 13th. The Los Angeles Philharmonic was due to tour France, but has just cancelled. We'd be delighted to invite you instead, for what would surely be an unforgettable evening. This is an official invitation. I suggest we arrange to talk on the phone tomorrow at 4 p.m. Moscow time. With cordial and respectful... Olivier Morne Duplessis, Director, Chatelet Theatre. It's in Russian. It's a hoax. It's signed with an official stamp. It's a French email address. So what? We're going instead of them. Paris! The Chatelet! The dream of a lifetime! Imagine, we'll bring the Bolshoi to Paris! Are you crazy? You want us to impersonate the Bolshoi? They're crap! We're much better than them. Throw that away before we all end up in jail. We haven't played in 30 years! - You have no orchestra! - Turn right. No rehearsal hall, no funding, no time to put together a real orchestra! 80 musicians in two weeks. You must be out of your mind! Why not a ballet, too! Right. 55 musicians. We only need 55 musicians. Stop, we're here. COMMUNIST PARTY Anyway, your plan will be ruined, - when they call the Bolshoi tomorrow. - Not, if we call first. The Communist Party? Are you nuts? Ivan Gavrilov! Ivan "KGB" Gavrilov! You're insane! What are we doing here? He's a great manager. They know him in France. - His French is better than Moliere's. - Moliere is dead. We need him. - He wrecked your career. Mine, too! - He obeyed orders. That's not true! He jumped on stage during Tchaikovsky's violin concerto and halted the concert to humiliate you! And he enjoyed doing it! He's the devil! I'm not going in there. I survived Communism once, I can't do it again. Sasha... You can play the cell again, or drive an ambulance for the rest of your life. Gavrilov owes us a concert. This Concert! Do you still manage orchestras? Hello to you, too. What orchestra? Kind of the Bolshoi, but not the Bolshoi. What? Is it the Bolshoi or isn't it? It is and it isn't. We need a great manager for an overseas concert. "We"? Who's "we"? "Our" fucking orchestra, shithead! The one you destroyed 30 years ago! Remember, we were great, and then you ruined it! 30 years ago, I did what I had to do! Back then, you'd have taken asylum in any shithole. You would have deserted your Motherland, have sold lies to the imperialist press, spit on the country that raised you... Housed you... Fed you! I know, I had reliable information! You destroyed our lives! You son of a bitch! Bastard! You're a bastard! A worthless ambulance driver! It's your fault that I drive an ambulance, that my wife and kids left me. You only have yourself to blame. You could've joined them in Israel. I still have my sources! Cut it out! Sasha! Ivan! We're here to talk about Paris. A concert at the Chatelet Theatre. They expect an answer tomorrow. What do you mean Paris? The Bolshoi sounds like mating cats these days. They're awful, and you know it. The French press will murder them. Did you say Paris? They'll say, "Russian orchestras are overrated, they're history." As Russians, can we allow that to happen? Paris... Why me? To negotiate everything. Like in the good old days. You were always the best manager the Bolshoi ever had. Paris... I'll do it. Did you see that twinkle in his eye? You can't trust him! He'll screw us over again! I saw fire in his eyes. He wants this. PARIS How many does the Chatelet seat? 2,000? I found it on the Internet. 2,000? I'll divorce you... if you don't do this. Prove you're still II Maestro and will finish this damn concert! 30 years, I've been waiting for this. 30 years! CONCERTO Enemy of the People! Bring down the curtain! BOLSHOI THEATRE This thing works? I called Israel twice a week on it. You bet it works. Without paying? You have no right. It belongs to the State, the People! - Should I send smoke signals then? - Silence! Quickly! - Hello? - Good day, fair Damsel! My humble respects. How are you today? Mr. Comrade Ivan Gavrilov on the horn, here! The Director of the Bolshoi! I'd like the pleasure of conversation with Mr. Duplessis. - Put him on, thank you awfully. - Awfully...? - Just a minute, I'll see. - A minute? I'm calling from Moskva! A minute... Mr. Gavrilov? Good! How are you, my friend? Wunderbar! Enormously well, I thank you. Sorry, had I known you were back at the Bolshoi, I'd have addressed the fax to you. It's no problem! Do not forgive yourself. I'm not calling from the office. We have problems with... telecommunications. No need to shout, I can hear you perfectly. My apologies! I'll give you a ring each time, it's safer. OK. But let me entrust you my roving number. Yes... - You have the wherewithal to write? - Go ahead, I'm ready. 0, please again 0, 79104618830! So, Ivan, our concert? Can you make it happen? It depends on the terms and conditions. We must cancel a very lucrative concert. Your website says you're free that evening. We're playing a private concert for the East Russian "King of Natural Gas." The birthday for his concubine, as you say. I suggest to send you today a draft of entente-cordiale, implying our conditions. If it appeals to you, we can envisage making a quick seal on the dotted line. I'll expect your fax, but hurry, it's in 2 weeks. What are you playing? - Playing? - Yes. Yes, what we're playing... What are we playing, you idiots? Tchaikovsky! Hello? Ivan? Are you still there? Tchaikovsky. We'll be playing Tchaikovsky. - The Concerto for Violin and Orchestra. - Here we go again! I can't understand! Did you say Tchaikovsky? Tchaikovsky. Concerto for Violin and Orchestra. I can't hear you. Hello? Ivan? I'll be expecting your proposal. Well played. Happy now? You were perfect. You're still the best. I know. It's like riding a bike. You never forget. So they said, "yes"? We've got them by the balls! ?2,000 per musician. I double the rate. Bring the entire family, it's a wedding! Per diems, ?30 a day. - ?4,000 for Andrew. - I'll pay 350 rubles each! Now, what else are we playing? Tchaikovsky's Serenade, and Prokofiev's Concerto No. 1. Good. Paris will have to pay for flights and insurance. The State used to cover it. Not anymore. Now, the schedule. Day 1: Arrival... And the finest French dining at Le Trou Normand. Day 2: Rehearsal, and, of course, a must-do while in Paris, an evening cruise up the Seine. Day 3: The Concert. OK? Any questions? OK. Good. Is everything OK? I landed the wedding. 1,000 guests. We'll get our vegetable patch. - Is there sugar? - Right away. I'll give you a hand. - He wants to play Tchaikovsky. - I know. And you'll help him. - Me? - Yes, you. Go on... I'll insist on the Hotel Paris Lumiere. Off the Champs-Elysees. The very best. Three stars! Now, most importantly... Who's the soloist? I want Anne-Marie Jacquet. Are you kidding? She's a star! Excellent! We're stars, too! It's Anne-Marie Jacquet, or we don't play! Are we asking too much? We have to be demanding and temperamental. It looks strong... and professional. Does this include salaries? These are pre-Perestroika rates. You and Mr. Gavrilov go back a long way. He's doing you a favor. Maybe. Unless it's a trap. We need this concert, Mr. Duplessis. We promised the Board a prestigious, lucrative concert. We've lost the L.A. Philharmonic. Without L.A., we'll have a ?1.5 million deficit, - not the ?450,000 we projected. - Screw your figures! Other requests? 3 days in Paris instead of same-day arrival, a cruise on the Seine, and dinner at Le Trou Normand. - Sounds wretched, ever eaten there? - No. Screw them! No way! They'll sink us. They're still cheaper than L.A. 3 days, cruises, dinners... They think it looks professional. The Slav soul! What about Miss Jacquet? - Her fee? - Expensive. But her fee, plus agent, taxes, and insurance, and the orchestra, and their wish-list, it is still cheaper than L.A. Our profit margin is 55%. If we refuse Anne-Marie, it's 75%. Without her, there's no concert. They won't come, you idiot! They're a pain in the ass! Call her agent. I understand, Olivier, but my hands are tied. The answer's no. Don't call again. Yes, I'm sorry, too. Good luck. Goodbye. We have to go in 45 minutes. - Who was that? - No one. An interview for a Brazilian magazine. "Why aren't you married", etc. And why don't I play Tchaikovsky? Tchaikovsky? No. I heard you say, "She doesn't play Tchaikovsky." No. I mean, yes. They did ask that. - What are you doing? - Last incoming number. It was Duplessis. The Chatelet. Tchaikovsky in 2 weeks. Honestly! Between Madrid and Chicago. And they call now. No manners. Which orchestra? - The Bolshoi. - What? The Bolshoi! And you said, "no"? You've never played Tchaikovsky. You have Madrid just before, Chicago after... I passed on bread today. The honey arrives tomorrow. Guylene. Are you serious? I was always scared of Tchaikovsky, I know, but I dream of performing the Concerto with the Bolshoi! You know that, Guylene. The conductor's a nobody. The Bolshoi isn't what it used to be. It's too much of a risk. - Who's the conductor? - I don't know. I can't remember. Andrei Flipo... Marazov, or something like that. - Andrei Filipov? - Yes. - That's it. Heard of him? - You're joking! Of course, I have. The Maestro, Guylene! The man's a legend. Tchaikovsky with him? - It's a no-brainer. - That was 30 years ago. Call Duplessis. Tell him I'll do it. Got that? Goodness! Rivka! Look who it is! The man who dared say, "screw you" to Brezhnev. - How is your asthma? - He refuses his medication. - He coughs like a donkey. - I play better with asthma. Come in. They have synagogues in Paris? Aren't they all anti-Semitic? More synagogues than churches! One on every street. French Catholics have all gone secular. When the Cardinal died, they said Kaddish outside Notre Dame. It's half-Jewish, half-Christian there now. France has changed a lot. Can we count you in, Viktor? For you, Andrei. - You're one of the Righteous. - I'll bring along my son, Moshe. The Louis Armstrong of classic music. Better than his old man. - May God be with you. - Amen. Taxi! Found it! Go away, Andrei. You're nothing but bad luck! My fiddle! Take a seat and listen. Please, take your seats. - Hi! - Who let you in here? Bad news. Paris won't prepay the flights. They reimburse us later. - What? - Times have changed. The Bolshoi has to pay the initial expenses. May I? Liar! It's part of your plan, to sabotage the concert! You have to find a solution. - Such as? - Ever heard of sponsors? - Go hang out by the limos. - An oligarch! They buy soccer clubs, not music. There's no money in music. You download it for free! Listen to me, Gavrilov! 30 years ago, when you did your little number during my husband's concert, you drove him to drink, ruined his life. And we lost two of our best friends, I kept silent! Now it's your turn to shut up, or I'll have your balls on a plate! Sorry. Just find them a sponsor, and a nice little flight to Paris. And if anything goes wrong in France... seek political asylum there. Because your Sunday meetings will be solo performances for pigeons in the park! I'll see to it that no extra in this town ever works for you again! That's a promise. Got that? Silence! Sit! Ladies and gentlemen, my best and oldest friends, Mr. Minister, members of the Parliament, please welcome the "Tsar of Gas," the "King of Cobalt," one of the most beautiful success stories of our brave new Russia... My great friend, the richest cellist on the planet, Piotr Tretiakin! Put your hands together! Let's hear it! Go for it, Petya! Go for it, Petya! Yes, this is Ivan Gavrilov. Yes... Go, Petya! I don't give a damn! No Trou Normand, no concert! I demand Le Trou Normand! He hung up on me because of your Trou Normand. It's not my fault. There is no Trou Normand. Not where he said it is. There is already a restaurant there. We'll just change the sign to Le Trou Normand. Tell Gavrilov we accept his conditions. Get him to send us the damn contract. It's in one week. I want posters, press, national TV! We have Anne-Marie Jacquet. We just need to find... ...a sponsor? It's an honor, gentlemen. See, Mommy, my cello lessons paid off. You can't play to save your life! Buy a soccer club. Thank you so much, Mr. Tretiakin. We'll be in touch. - Mommy, good day to you. - I'll see you out. No, really, the pleasure is all mine. My fiver can pick up the score. I'm flattered to be playing with you. I'm ready for it. Business is a pastime, a hobby, but music... Music is my whole life! Turn around! We must return that check right now! - We'll be a laughing stock! - Calm down. We have the orchestra, we have Anne-Marie Jacquet, money for the flights... And a gangster in the cello section! What's that? I have some good news, and some bad news. The bad news first. You need a visa to get into France. Half the musicians don't even have passports. It's three weeks for a passport, and one for a visa. Great. Now you tell us. And the good news? We have Le Trou Normand! 55 passports and visas? Including you, Maestro? 56, including Ivan. I'll get 60 blank ones, just in case. You can do that by tomorrow? Yes, but it's not free. We're not millionaires, you know. Go ahead, we'll pay. They'll need passport photos. We'll make them at the airport. Actually, Vassili, there's something else... Anything for you, Maestro. We're short a few instruments. Over the years, some people sold theirs. Same goes for their suits and shoes. Wait for Paris. - I know people there. - No... Andrei, it's like my grandmother used to say, "The sun rises every morning. Never in the evening." What grandmother? Let me explain. Here, it's the evening. But in Paris it will be morning. Viktor, look after Moshe. - He's never been to Paris! - Mom, I'm 35 years old! Shalom Alekum, everyone! As soon as you arrive, hang up your trousers. The hotel will have an iron in the room... Ask them to polish your shoes. I don't want you to look like a tramp. Are you listening? - Where are the buses? - Patience, patience. They're 45 minutes late. So the dream ends. Are you getting off on this? - Did you pay them? - Of course. So they don't show. "Best Manager in Moscow!" How about taxis? How many do we need? Taxis are not in the budget. Don't panic, we've plenty of time. Everyone form a line! Thank you, my friend. Everybody get your photo ready! No pushing and shoving! Check your details. Let's keep it moving, folks! Have you got your photo? Next! Next! Just a French visa? Add a Moroccan passport for ?10. I'm not going to Morocco. - Take it, you never know. - I said, "no". Thanks. Hey, chief, there's nothing to see here. Why don't we take a walk? Yulia, I already told you... Read me the contract. It's Clause 1. He's with us. Enjoy your flight. He's with us. Mr. Duplessis. It's Jean-Paul. I'm here. The plane just landed. Bolshoi? Hello, Mr. Filipov. Welcome to Paris. I'm so honored! Mrs. Filipov! Please, Mr. Duplessis, this gentleman is not Mr. Filipov. - I'm not Mr. Duplessis. - Charmed. I'm Ivan Gavrilov. This is Mr. Tretyakin. Here is Mr. Filipov! Andrei Filipov... Olivier Duplessis. I'm not Mr. Duplessis! I'm Jean-Paul Carrere. Mr. Duplessis sends his regards. Where is he? - Where is the orchestra? - Try to understand. They travel tirelessly for weeks. They're exhausted. - I see. - You see nothing. - Take us to our hotel. - Of course. Let's see. Tomorrow: Rehearsal. After, Mr. Filipov will dine with Miss Jacquet, at her request. And to end the evening in style, we've booked a lovely Seine river cruise, that will take 2 hours and 20 minutes. - And Le Trou Normand? - Tonight! We've reserved the entire restaurant for the Bolshoi. Crook! Swindler! Give us our money! - What'd he say? - We want our cash now! - We want food! - And cigarettes! And drink! They want their per diem now! Don't worry, you'll get your per diems tomorrow. Pay up, you bastard! Pay up! - You don't need money tonight! - Kick his balls. Le Trou Normand is in half an hour. Get our money, boy! - Make them see sense! - If I were you, I'd cough up. Ladies and gentlemen! Our young friend put his words into action, and your money's here. You have to sign a receipt! One at a time! We're going to Le Trou Normand! Hold on! One at a time! ?100 each! Rehearsal is tomorrow morning! The bus leaves at 10 a.m. Sharp! Don't be late! Andrei? Yes, it's me. Oh my God! Guylene... It's... I'm happiness to see you. How are you? You're no change. Please sit down. Be honest, do you plan to tell her? Why do you speak that? No, of course. Are you sure? Look me in the eye. I'm here only for the concert. She has her life, she's a grown woman. Don't hurt her. - It was hard enough, as it was. - Guylene. I'd never do that. Who do you think I am? You think me... Never. Very well. That's settled, then. Good night. Good night. FRENCH EMBASSY Pardon, good sir... Have you glimpsed the others? - They all went out. - To Le Trou Normand? I guess so. They were on foot. Are you ready? I'm famished. You really want to play Tchaikovsky's Serenade and Prokofiev? You hate Prokofiev. We're playing Tchaikovsky's Concerto, that's all. I don't care about the rest. But the Chatelet... You bought new shoes? Let's see. You have all Anne-Marie Jacquet's albums? Every single one. And all the reviews I could find. Now, that's... Either you're a huge fan, or... - Are you and Irina OK? - Think about it. How old does she look to you? Who? Anne-Marie Jacquet? 26, maybe. Take a good look. 29. What happened 29 years ago? How should I? No... Oh my God! Don't tell me she's... Her? No... Yes. Now you know. It's her. FRENCH COMMUNIST PARTY - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. Does this happen to be - Le Trou Normand? - That's right, sir. You're at Le Trou Normand, and you are... You're the Bolshoi? Fret not. The others come on foot from Arrondissement 8. 8? Very nice. Has Comrade Maurice arrived perchance? - Maurice? - Maurice. No, perchance. - No? - Shall we begin? Thank you very much. Take a seat wherever you like. Here? Over there? - Here. - Wonderful. Jessica! C'mon, let's go! Bolshoi! It's cheaper than McDonald's in Moscow. I got ketchup, mayo and mustard. 10 of each. Eat, it's free. Ivan's expecting us at Le Trou Normand. I don't dine with the KGB. Does Irina know about her? Anne-Marie Jacquet? No, it's a secret. You've never spoken? Anne-Marie has no idea? Tell me you're only here to conduct. Just conduct. Tchaikovsky. Nothing but Tchaikovsky. All the way through. All the way through. What now? We wait some more? No, bring on the repast. I have very hungry. We have very hungry, too! Are you OK, Sweetie Pie? You sound down in the dumps. I'm fine, sweetheart. Missing you, that's all. I miss you too, Sweetie Pie. - Sleep well, you need to rest. - Irisha, I... I can't go through with this. I really wish you were here. I'm there with you, Sweetie Pie. You can do it. I believe in you. Sleep. I'll hang up now, it's too expensive. I love you. Call me after the concert. Good rehearsal tomorrow. - Big kisses... - Big kisses. - Ivan! - Momo! You're late! Where were you? I just finished one of the Party's endless meetings. It's good to see you. What happened to Le Trou Normand? It was our headquarters. Membership was down. We had to sell. Here too, soon. We have more offices than members these days. Let's find a real French cafe, where we can converse. It's time to change things. To restore the Party's leadership of France and the world, to set an example! Are you ready? RUSSIAN STATE TV Good morning. Maestro! What a pleasure to have you here! We're sold out. Your admirers swamped the box office. They never forget you. Isn't it wonderful? Olivier Duplessis at your service and eternally grateful. Thank you very much. He thinks I'm an idiot? I know they're the Bolshoi. "Bolshoi" also means "a lot." He's saying, "Thanks very much." Thanks Bolshoi to you! He won't let go of my hand. - Can you fill this place? - We still have 1,000 members. We scored 1% at the last elections, nearly 2%! That makes 44 million voters - divided by... - We'll put it there, OK? What is it? The flag! Our standard! From the 1966 Party Congress in Moscow! You remember it, Momo? We got 100% of the vote! 100%! A historic moment. - The People united in one cause! - How could I forget it? 100%! No one ever did better. I'm late, I must make haste. Keep it, Momo. Keep it. Come on. Back up. Move it! I'm begging you. Pay me back! My card's blocked. The bank wants the money by 4 p.m. Calm down. All in good time. I need the money now! They partied all night at a Russian restaurant! Not Le Trou Normand. I wrote a ?1,536 check to cover their bar tab. That check will bounce! If you bailed them out, where are they? Playing Tchaikovsky's, previously unknown... Silence for Violin and Orchestra? Did something get lost in translation? Is this an orchestra or a quartet? Where's your orchestra? I'm delightful to meet you. Fear not a bit. They'll be here immediately. They're not French. Nor German, far from it. We, Russians, make a point of protocol of reaching a little lateness. Try to understand and extend your courtesy. Ivan Gavrilov? You're late! And so is your spasiba Bolshoi! Had to be Russians! We could've had Yanks! Where are they? It's your job. Where's my orchestra? Good price caviar! Taste! How much? ?200, a special discount for you. It's cheaper at the supermarket. No, thanks. - But better, no? - No. - Caviar's passe. - What do you know? If we had Chinese cell phones, we'd have sold out. My dear Anne-Marie, a pleasure to see you again! For me, too. Here's our Maestro! Andrei Filipov. Anne-Marie Jacquet. - Hello. - Hello. I kiss you hotly. We're running a touch late. The famous Slav temperament? Something like that, yes. - Where's this go? - Up there, next to them. Igor! Yuri! Move your asses! Madam, move aside. Jean-Paul? Can someone call Jean-Paul to the stage? Why didn't you bring Chinese phones, "genius"? I did. I gave one to each musician to get them through Customs. Except Andrei, Sasha, and Ivan, to keep it quiet. 50 mobiles with fake SIM cards. Unlimited calls worldwide. - A great deal! - My son! You're a genius! You're just like me. We're rich! Trouble is, they won't return the phones. What? You idiot, call them! They won't answer. Don't they have cell phones? Maybe it's traffic. No one's at the hotel. Just improvise. What do you mean? Tchaikovsky with 3 instruments? This is a waste of time. Don't stop. That was wonderful. What's your name? Aleksandr Abramovich Grossman. Have forgiveness. It's a lot of compliment for me. Not wonderful. It's a lot difficult for me. I'm the most not good in the orchestra. - Are you kidding? - No, it's true. Maestro tell me, "Rehearse. Rehearse, Sasha! No good!" Others never rehearse. Me do. Me... Need much rehearse... To good the level. It's true. I hate rehearsing for camera men, don't you know? I think rehearse deads spontaneity. - No rehearsals? At all? - No rehearsals. We beg pardon from you. You come here for no reason. For us, spontaneity important. Music is spontaneity. If the Bolshoi technique is so perfect... You think us pretentious? Not technique. Soul. Our spirit! You ask where are musicians. They learn, take inspiration in Paris, City of Lights. In museums. Louvre, Musee Rodin, Centre Pompidou... - Right, Sasha? - Excuse! These are all cousins of mine. We're just missing a bassoon. One of our "rentals" went poorly. The police meddle in everything here. Put the instruments on the chairs. Violins here, cellos over there... Let's move it! Double basses and oboes up there... The flute there with the French horn... Shoes there. Suits there. Start ironing. Hurry, let's move it. Socks on the chair! Get your asses in gear! Holy shit! Enough. Get me Duplessis. Here, toots, me not steal. - How'd you do that? - Do what? Those harmonic arpeggios... With my hand. What fingering do you use? It's amazing. Where did you study? Andrei, who is this chick? What's she talking about? Forgive me. I'm... I feel so silly. - Sorry, if I made a scene. - No problem, Mademoiselle. You can still make dinner tonight? Yes, don't you know? See you there at 8. You don't own broadcast rights! You understand "rights"? I sponsor the orchestra. Without me, no orchestra. You understand "orchestra"? - Don't be offensive. - Who are you? Director of the Chatelet. Olivier Morne Duplessis. Never heard of you. Look, we have an exclusive contract with France Televisions. Your problem. I have a deal with Russian TV. 50 million viewers! My friend, the President, will watch live via satellite. I've invited him to my dacha. You want us to cut off gas to Europe? Just ask the Germans. You wanted the Russians. Let's look at possible solutions. The contract says, we're not to blame for "natural overflow." "Natural overflow"? Yes, signals going astray in space, hitting the wrong satellite and being beamed to other countries or even planets. Sure, we can't control everything. Huge satellites that pick up music and pictures. Don't you agree, Mr. Tretiakin? I don't give a shit. We'll find them. They won't let us down. They're the best. Do you really think that? It's them! My orchestra! Sasha, come on! It's your fault. You're too fat and slow! You wanna keep looking? OK, let's go. I'll spend all night looking. - Calm down. - At last. - Andrei, Mr. Duplessis... - Shut up, I'm doing the talking! In 27 years, I've never seen such unprofessional behavior. You think I'm stupid? "Russians don't rehearse!" - In our orchestra... - Enough already! This is an official warning for you all. You didn't respect our contract. Be there two hours before the concert, or I call it off! You think I wouldn't dare? Try me! - Are they back? - No, their keys are gone. - I slipped notes under their doors. - Shove your keys and notes! I saw them in the Metro. Go fetch them! Fax the schedule to their hotel, so they have no excuse for being late. Right away... Fax this to the Bolshoi right away! Leonid Dimitrievich, a fax for you! No faxes. I'm on vacation! - To the concert! - To the concert! - Mr. Filipov... - Andrei, if you desire. Is it true you defied the regime, to defend your Jewish musicians? To defend your entire orchestra? It was nothing heroic... Don't you know? There was no choice. Difficult times. - Complex things. "Complex"? - Yes. That we lived... Don't you know? This concerto is... It's like, don't you know... A confession. A cry. In every note, there is life... Anne-Marie. The notes all look for harmony. Look for happiness. Can I make a confession? I was raised by an extraordinary woman. Guylene. You saw her at the rehearsal. She's a mother to me. As well as my agent and manager, she's my friend. My only friend. I never knew my parents. Sorry, forgive me. No problem. Please, continue. I long to feel my parents watching me. In the street. Everywhere. When I play, I'm reaching for the feeling of their eyes on me. For one second. Just one second. They were wonderful people. Richard and Sophie Jacquet. Both brilliant scientists. He was a biologist, she was an anthropologist. Guylene told me their story. They were her best friends. They died when I was a baby. A plane crash in the Alps. Everything fine? Here we have Ivan Tikhomirov and Igor Obukhov... Great musicians. Tikhomirov, wow! Papa, you're always late. He said 10 p.m. No, 10:30. All right then, so climb aboard. Why did you choose me? I work a lot on Tchaikovsky's Concerto. I... obsessed, sick, don't you know? I think, with the Concerto, I find ultimate harmony. Absolute music. Perfection. So I look for a solo violin. I find Lea. Lea Strum. Brilliant, extraordinary. Become great friends. All of us at the time. Lea and Yitzhak, her husband. We keep rehearsing, looking. Not normal life. Crazy! One day, I find out Brezhnev plans to expel Jewish musicians from the orchestra. I panic. Lea is Jewish. Lea and me decide to play Tchaikovsky's Concerto. Quick! I... not defend Jews, Anne-Marie. I... selfish. Defend Concerto and a crazy dream. I need Lea and Jews to reach... harmony. And then? June 12, 1980. Concerto. - Were you ready? - No. Yes... How to know? Bolshoi Theatre. Full house. Many people. Journalists from around the world. Managers, colleagues... Concerto... begin. Miracle happens. Lea... sublime. Magic violin raises me and orchestra up to the sky. Very high. We... fly. We... and audience together fly to ultimate harmony. But Concerto stopped half way. We never reached the ultimate harmony. Brezhnev interrupts Concerto, to publicly humiliate us. Brezhnev cuts off our wings. We crash very down. After... All Jews thrown out. Lea, Sasha, all. - You were fired, too? - Yes, but it was over. I can't play without them. What happened to Lea? Lea and Yitzhak give interview to Radio Free Europe, American radio banned in the Soviet Union. They... criticize Brezhnev. Don't you know? - What, then? - Nothing. You want me to replace Lea? You didn't want me. I'm not Lea. You haven't conducted in 30 years. I've never played Tchaikovsky. We haven't even rehearsed. I understand your pain. But I'm not Lea. And together we won't reach the ultimate harmony. It was a dream, this concert... With you. You should get help. You can't bring back the past. We can't do the concert. It's doomed to fail. Do you need a lift back? - When he's ready, call him a taxi. - Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry. Yes? Well? Nothing. What happened? Nothing. Cancel Chatelet. You had to do it. - Don't yell at me. - Nobody's yelling. - How's vodka? - French. You fool! It's all over. Finished. The concert, Tchaikovsky, the orchestra, Anne-Marie. Kaput! Well played, Brezhnev, you win again. Ira deserved children, a good husband... I've ruined her whole life. Here, give her this letter. Give it to her yourself! Don't make the same mistake twice. 30 years ago, it wasn't your fault. - I dragged Lea into that craziness. - No! Wrong! She was consumed by the same madness as you. Let's go. Please, Guylene. I have to talk to her. He was drunk. He talks a lot of nonsense. Too much emotion for you. Don't do this! Don't cancel! Please! Very important concert for him. If no concert, he dies. - Kill him. - Sir, please leave. Guylene. Let him in. You have no right. Andrei, the most good in the world. - Brezhnev... - I know the story. His career's over. His honor's over. He's a great man! A genius! They turn him into a loser, into alco... Alcoholic. - Me, Jewish, like... - Lea... and Yitzhak Strum, I know. I don't ask you like Andrei. Just play violin. Please. Come play concert. I'm sorry about what happened to Mr. Filipov and his friends. But a concert isn't a psychotherapy session. The man is sick. He wants me to be a ghost. To fall into the same madness as that poor violinist? No. The answer's no. Goodbye, sir. What if at the end of the concert, you'd find your parents? What did you say? That... Oh God! Music sometimes helps us grow. Gives answers to us. We scared, scared before we play music. Scared of truth. I don't understand. Talk clearly. Clearly? Nothing clear. Nothing ever clear. Me, poor idiot, messed up my life. You ask for words, but words are traitors. Words are dirty! Only music's still beautiful. But music's prisoner in us. Music... refuses to come out of us. Why? Sorry to bother you. Sorry. Goodbye. Goodbye, Guylene. Mr. Grossman... Either you said too much, or not enough. How do you know Guylene? What did you mean... "At the end of the concert, you'll find your parents"? You're Jewish? You ignore Shabbat, Kippur! Being named Moshe doesn't make you Jewish! Did God send you a fax? Answer me, please. Sasha. You're pale. Do you want a pill? Not a word. I'm sorry. Goodbye. Guylene? TCHAIKOVSKY CONCERTO My darling, Play the concert, play Tchaikovsky. Maybe you'll find the truth about your parents. Sorry that I lied to you all these years. I was trying to protect you, for your own good. Many years ago, Andrei Filipov gave me Lea Strum's annotated score. I give it to you now. Don't look for me. When you read this, I'll be far away. I love you. Guylene. MAHLER - SYMPHONY NO. 1 ANDREl FILIPOV Good evening, Hotel Paris Lumiere. Mr. Sasha Grossman, please. RUSSIAN INTERPRETER COME BACK! FOR LEA. Paris! ONE NIGHT ONLY TONIGHT I'm the Bolshoi! Madam Minister. Sir. Mr. Ambassador. Madam. 51, 52... You make 53. Who's missing? - Sasha, relax, it's OK. - Where's Viktor and his son? - They'll make it, they sent the text. - So, text them! Straight, then left by the river, then left onto Place du Chatelet. How can you live in Paris and not know the Chatelet Theatre? - You're leaving? - I am. You're not going anywhere. Why? You're here, that's the main thing. In 30 years, I've heard more Tchaikovsky than his own mother! I know him by heart. Nothing is more than this concert. Actually there is something! My speech at the Party meeting. - Get out of the way! - The Party? You came to Paris for a pathetic meeting? I'm here to give hope. To breathe life into a dream. - The Great Dream, remember that! - Yes, I remember... "Workers of the world, unite!" Unite against each other. You're so selfish. Your concert, your dream, your ego! That's all you care about! An orchestra is a whole world. Ivan... A whole world. Everybody brings their instrument and talent. We're united for the concert, playing together, in hope of producing a magical sound and attaining harmony. Maestro, allow me to introduce Raymond Laudeyrac... My pleasure, sir. I can't wait to hear... Your ideas. Our most influential critic. He's always like that, he hates Russian music, especially Tchaikovsky. Break a leg! It's going to be fantastic! UNITED INTO TOMORROW Communists! Communists! Comrades! The time has come! Moscow is behind us once more! They have sent us Ivan Gavrilov... A true Russian leader! Ivan Gavrilov? You? Thank God you're here! It's a scandal! An outrage! I was outnumbered! It's the Jews again! Leonid, providence has sent you to help me! Hurry, they might have started already. We need to move fast! This way, hurry! Gavrilov, open up! God, if You really are up there, work a miracle. Prove that You exist, after all. Oh my God, I don't believe it. You exist! Anne-Marie, I didn't finish my story. After the interview on Radio Free Europe, Lea and Yitzhak were arrested by the KGB. They had a daughter, a six-month old baby. Seeing the KGB arriving, they gave her to a neighbor, who brought her to us. Take her to France, please. What kind of life awaited the Jewish child of "enemies of the state"... ... condemned to the gulags for life? Irina, Sasha, and I smuggled her to France, with a friend, a musical agent, who was visiting Moscow. Lea and Yitzhak were sent to Siberia. As long as she lived, Lea played Tchaikovsky's Concerto in her head. They called her "the madwoman". She died of exhaustion and cold in 1981. Yitzhak died of grief 6 months later. Tchaikovsky, the Violin Concerto. I was the one, who dragged Lea into this madness. Anne-Marie, Lea was your mother. Enemy of the People! Curtain! Anne-Marie, forgive me. Mom! Check this out! Dad's on TV! He's playing in Paris! Sasha's in Paris? THE ANDREl FILIPOV ORCHESTRA 5 EXTRA PERFORMANCES Amen. ---the end---
