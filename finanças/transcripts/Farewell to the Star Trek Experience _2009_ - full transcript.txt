That it is. Oh, yes. - Thank you, baby. - A little happy face. - Tom, did you sign this? - No. Come on over here. - Just let me know. - Just your first name. - We're on a first-name basis. - Oh, yes, we are. - We should be, after all this time. - That's right. - We share K-Y. - That's true. Is he on the phone? Of course. You know, when he wears that Bluetooth, I can't tell if he's talking to me sometimes. Yeah, I can't... I don't know. I mean, I can if I'm not there to... - Wait. I brought some tissues. - You brought tissues. This is from a redheaded Klingon, I guess. - Okay. - Okay, I'm in. I've got... Okay, I'm going. I just want to take this and leave that shirt. This is going to be an interesting day because we've got so many fans that know us now, both ways. And it's kind of like we've grown up with a lot of people, and it's really amazing. I think that I'm going to be so busy during the day that I'm not going to have a conscious awareness that this is the end, at least I hope, because I don't want anything to affect what I'm doing out there. This is the last show for a lot of these people. So nothing... I can't let anything get in the way. The jury's still out on if it's canon or not, but the gold chain and the bar has been with my character for seven years. Used to be signed by Jeffrey Combs, but it's long since faded. I start with the back and work my way to the front 'cause it takes the back... Then it's dry and I don't have to worry about it. But over the course of the day, I have to keep checking it because people like to touch me. I'll come back and there's like a big pink spot back there. - Get out. - Oh, shut up. Yes, they do. Hey, you dropped some there. It's the last day. What are you gonna do, fire me? Go for it. There goes my severance. Shoulder injury, so she's gotta put this over my shoulder for me. These are the worst boots in the world. They're very painful, and they're like 4-inch platforms. I know they're platforms. Everybody comes up and says, "Yeah, he's wearing platforms," but it's still very intimidating to hover over somebody in a pair of these, and so... It's theatrical. I mean, come on, it's all fake. Ten years, you guys have been coming up to me saying, "He's wearing platforms." Dude, I'm wearing a mask, I'm wearing a costume, I'm wearing makeup. You know? And these are very painful, though, and I do this for you. Pain in my craft. And I have to wrap my ankles so these things don't kill me every day. - It's fake? Are you kidding me? - It's fake. - It's fake? Oh, my God. - It's totally fake. I'm so depressed now. I'm getting naked, so go away. Go away. Go. The box. They call me Princess around here. - I honestly haven't seen a... - And you just got an earful why. - Thank you, Crystal. - You're welcome. Have a good day, hon. Since I'm halfway between Rog'l and Richard, I guess now I'm Rig'l. I'm just gonna go out and enjoy myself. Once I'm in this gear, I am no longer Tom and everybody here knows it, because even when I'm backstage, if I'm still wearing the head, beware, "cause the General has a temper. It's you again, with a two-dimensional moving replicator. And he's moving. Excellent. I shall return momentarily. Well, once Commander Tahryn comes out, she's not sentimental about this place, so she's gonna help me a lot. And I don't know if you know this, but later on in the day I'm going to morph into my Vulcan character. I'm so grateful for those characters 'cause, like I said, Tahryn... Everybody's crying out there, she's like, "You humans are so sentimental. Get over it." And T'pril will use that suppressed emotion, so I'll be suppressing a lot of emotion today. I had to change my mindset, I have to say, about a few months ago when we heard the rumours that it might possibly end. So I had to just sit down and turn my head back around to, "Okay, what's next?" I was used to, "What was next?‚Äù for 20 years, and when I didn't have a dancing gig, I went and did something normal like every other actor does, you know, go get a regular job, go back to the gig, go get a regular, go back to the gig. So I had to get my head wrapped back around that. This one came as unemployment was about to run out 10 years ago, so... And here I've been for 10 years. They're gonna be real emotional today. They've been laying it on pretty thick. It's been building. It totally has. And every time April cries back here, it just chokes us all up, and she's always the first. Stop it. Klingons are not supposed to have tear ducts. - I can't do this today, so... - Yeah. No, no, no. All right. Okay, this is good. - There's no schedule any more. - There's no sign in/sign out sheet today. I love that. We used to have to sign in and sign out. Like when you were out on the floor, blah blah blah, you put your time in, time out. There isn't one today. Yay. Welcome to the final performance of Star Trek The Experience. The day that, I think, a lot of us didn't want to come, but it's here. It's here, and I want you to take great pride in everything that you do today and know that your fans are lined up to see you. - They are. - They're expecting exactly what you've given them for the last 10 years. Have a fun day. It's been a hell of a ride, and we do not want this to end, but all good things... All good things... Have a great day. I'm looking forward to the ceremony tonight, guys, and seeing you coming down the aisle, decommissioning in its proper way. Have a wonderful day. Lots of energy. I love you. - Love you. - Thank you very much. We love you, too. Let's bring it in. Let's bring it in. Let's bring it in. Yeah. Have a great day, guys. Let's do it. Let's do it. Rock and roll. All right, guys, places. Final day of The Experience has begun today with a very sad pre-shift. We've stood in our circle that we have for the last 10 years in preparation for the day, and the day has begun, obviously, with our regular operating hours. We are going to end the shows to the public at 8:00 tonight. We will have our VIP final crew board for the final time at 8:30 on Borg Invasion and Klingon Encounter at 9:00. - Have a good show, you guys. - Thank you. You, too. Well, to give you an idea, the longest-running show in Vegas is the Folies Bergere. They have done since, I believe, 1957, about 65,000 shows. Lot of shows, lot of years. We've been here 10 years. We've done over 175,000 shows. We are the longest-running show in Star Trek franchise history. The employees have really, really borne up under a good deal of stress over the last couple of months, with humour, with generosity, and I guess just the spirit of this place has kept the employees going, and, in turn, the spirit of the people who've come to say goodbye during this last couple of months has helped the employees' attitudes and their emotions considerably. Many humans. Well, today is unlike anything I've ever gone through or witnessed here. There's just such an outpouring of love and affection from the group that's gathered here, from the visitors, from the guests and from our regulars. These are people who have come here specifically to say goodbye to this facility, people who love this facility, who've come here and supported us over the years, and it's just overwhelming, the affection that we're feeling from everybody that's here today. So, what do you need to know, female? You have question of some sort? I'm sorry to see you guys leave. There're a lot of that going around. Welcome. Enjoy yourself while you are here. Proper handshake is like this. Good. Excellent. This is Quan. This is Quan, our favourite Ferengi. - What? - And Quan is responsible for all of the revenue here. He's in control of the funds and makes sure that it's kept safe. - Right, Quan? - Well, I watch the money. I stand near the money. I look at the money. I don't often count the money, but I smell the money, which is good, and it's a good smell. I think that Star Trek has some of the best-smelling money. I mean, I'm just... I mean, maybe I sound a little prejudiced... - It's good-smelling money. - ...but I'm just saying it is... It's a really good, good smell. I mean, there are some other money out there that does not smell as good as Star Trek money. And the Star Trek money has been smelling very good for this long. There are fans who have been coming here forever and, literally, there are fans who believe that Star Trek The Experience has cured them of diseases, has changed their lives significantly. This is a place where people come to live out their fantasies. - Trekkies. - Trekkies. - Trekkies. - Trekkies. That's one thing about this place. It's always been a place where you have a good time. It's one thing that's always been good about Star Trek, we enjoy ourselves. This is like life. This is like... Eugene Roddenberry said, "This is a lot of hope." A lot of hope. - Thank all of you. - Yes! Thank all of you. - Thank you. - Thank you. It was crazy yesterday. We had over 2,500 scans yesterday. A lot of people in costume. A lot of sad people. A lot of people telling their stories about how many times they've seen the shows. It was really crazy yesterday. I expect tonight, it should get really crazy during the decommissioning ceremony. - How was it? - Excellent. This will be my 1,015th time. I've been coming out here for nine years. January of '99 was my first week out here and that was... I didn't think even they could top that experience till the New Year's Eve party. We brought New Year's Eve in on the Bridge of the Starship Enterprise-D. They've treated me like family. They know me by name. I told them if I ever hit the lottery, they'd never have to worry about the old folks' home. I would take care of them for the rest of their lives. Kind of a sad, happy affair at the same time. If you caught me later tonight, it'd be a tear-fest. I want to say, humans, that in 10 years it has been good getting to know all of you. I want to say that on this planet, everyone here today is the best thing about this planet. Everyone who believes in what you believe in and what you stand for and what you're doing here today, may you die with your eyes wide open and your underwear dry. It's unfortunate that we are having our last day today, but it's gratifying to know how many people really are just anxious and eager to show us how much they love. Well, I've been here for 565 straight days. Well, we decided, once we heard it was closing, that what was something silly to do? So, I decided, "Well, why not come here every day?‚Äù We got married on the Bridge, and this has, like, So many special memories for us, but we've made so many friends. "Cause we didn't know Dave before we came here. I had my 40th birthday on the Captain's Lounge back in May, - and these two were here. - Yeah. So, you know, we've made so many friends. We're just... We're just really sad to see this place go, but all the people that have worked here have done such a tremendous job, and it's been just a joy to be able to come here and escape the everyday world and just go to the 24th century for a few hours every day. The fans' reaction to our closing was tremendous. And throughout all of the emails and letters that I received, it was only appropriate to display all of these very, very detailed letters and intimate letters, describing everyone's experiences. We've got photographs, we've got emails, we've got handwritten notes that were done here at The Experience. There's walls and walls of messages, and still stacks of messages that we haven't gotten to, to display. Again, it's a testimony, it's an example of the fan base that we do have, the dedication that we do have, and the sadness and anger that our fans are experiencing that their home is being taken away. It sucks. It's as simple as that. It's kind of like... I don't know if you've heard about interactive Stitch at Disneyland, but when they turned that off, I went to city hall and said, "Bad idea." This is possibly the finest salute to Roddenberry and the Roddenberry idea of Star Trek, Starfleet, and it's going away and that's not good. I feel like I've had a home and I'm being foreclosed on. However, the happy part is that I've had a home and I've had a memory that's gonna last me a lifetime, and it's incredible. It's incredible. - Quan! Quan! Quan! - Quan! Quan! Quan! - Quan! Quan! Quan! - Quan! Quan! Quan! - Hell, no, we won't go. - Hell, no, we won't go. - Hell, no, we won't go. - Hell, no, we won't go. It's very strange. They seem to be drinking a great deal, and pounding on the bar and threatening to stay there forever. You've seen the wall of all the letters, and just the heart that's here. You know, I think that the world needs Star Trek as much as it ever has, or maybe even more these days, and I think that the fans being able to come and celebrate that and be together, it's been just really lovely, and it's sad to see it go. Everything about this place IS SO unique and special, the rides, the people, the food, and it's just wonderful to bump into people from all over the world who are here experiencing it right along with us. This franchise is too powerful to die. - Absolutely. - Yes. Like Jean-Luc said, there's plenty more letters in the alphabet, so this was just part of the chapter that's gonna continue, I'm sure, later on. - ...2, 3. Live long and prosper! - ...2, 3. Live long and prosper! Thank you. This is it. The last ride. ...take you down to airlock number one. - This is it. - Yeah. - Wow. - Wow. Hey, say what you want about it, Jim. Thank you so much. I love you. - Have a good trek. - They're like water. We assimilate, we love. That was the last time. On January 4th, 1998, Star Trek was charged with a 10-year mission. This dream has bound us together for a decade and brings us together one last time here tonight. This is Star Trek The Experience. Ten years is over 3 million visitors and over 150,000 missions flown. But this evening is not about what's possible, this evening is about who made all this possible, and here they are, the crew that bravely and with great dedication saw this mission to its end. Lynn Sterling. Richard Oden. Kerstan Szczepanski. Tom Deishley. Mark Weitz. Jerad Formby. Russell Giles. Chad Boutte. In accordance with tradition, the first crew member assigned to The Experience is now the last to disembark. Ms April Hebert. For 10 years, this banner, bearing the seal of the United Federation of Planets, has stood watch over this facility. In observance of maritime tradition, as our longest-serving crew member, you are entrusted with its safekeeping. Ms April Hebert. Ladies and gentlemen, stay on your feet. Please give your unbridled thanks to the heroic crew of Star Trek The Experience. Bravo! I am Captain Chad Boultte. We stand here after 10 years because of the love of our fans. On behalf of everyone stationed here in Las Vegas, I thank each of you who made this place possible and hope that we always provided you with the fun you desired, the possibilities you needed and returned the love to you that you all demonstrated. It is time now for all of us to look to the future. As the lights are doused and the gates are sealed, it's time for all of us to explore the strange new possibilities before us. Live long and prosper. The future of The Experience is unknown at this time, but isn't that what life's all about, conquering the unknown?
