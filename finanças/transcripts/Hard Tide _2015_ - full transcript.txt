Plain sight. - Is that what you told the jury? - Don't be a fucking smart arse. Maybe I just like my liberty. There's only two ways out of this game, son. Yeah? I don't fancy either, mate. You want out? [scoffs] - Unbelievable. - What?! I dunno, maybe a, "See you later. I'm gonna miss ya. Come visit me." Fuckin' hell! I'm tryin' to give you something here, you ungrateful little shit! Thanks! Thanks for the responsibility of looking after everything while you're banged up inside. Is that what you wanna hear, yeah? Wh-what? "I'll treasure it always. It makes up for all the birthdays you missed." I wonder what Mum would have said? - All right, keep your fucking voice down. - [Jake scoffs] Some people would have killed for this little earner. I know. Stop acting like you're giving me a present. You give me all your fucking enemies on a plate. I got Simon Flowers on my case now. Well, steer clear of him. You think? Good idea. I don't want your advice. - I don't need it. I don't fucking want it. - I know. It's either the ditch or the nick for people like us, d'you get me? D'you think you're gonna wake up one morning on a mountain of pills and powder surrounded by tits and booze? It's a fuckin' graft, son. So let me give you this. Earn yourself some proper money. Fine. Fine. Look after yourself, Dad, yeah? Take care. Find yourself a nice girl. Yeah, I'm working on that. Yeah? A decent one. Like your mum. All right, Jake.

He's a little fucking prick. Doesn't matter what you think of him, what did he say? Why are we talking? Don't waste my time. You know I love you, Jake. Don't waste my fucking time. All right, all right. You're a ball ache, but I'll fuckin' do it. You sure? You George Bernard fuckin' sure? - I'm fuckin' sure. - Get that florist to run for his money. I don't know nothin' about that. I just do my thing, people do their thing, all right? You're getting fat, mate. [scoffs] Still take you though, bruv. [Tel] In your fuckin' dreams. Don't let me down. See you later. [dog barks] [buzzer] Sorry, mate. Oi! Come here! Oi! What you doin' here? What you doin' here? Why aren't you at school? What did I tell you today?

How'd you know where I live? Come on, then, if you're coming. Come on. Come on. I ain't gonna offer again. So where's your mum then? In heaven. What? Where's that? - In the sky. - What? Oh, shit. Right. Sorry. Come on. Anyone home? Alf? [tv] I think you all could have done this a lot differently. I really do. [Jade] DNA test. Oooh. How'd you know this show? Aren't you supposed to be at school? [tv] ...he's not your child... So who looks after you, then? [tv] Thank God for that, you're not the child's father... Your dad drink all the time? Kinda. You ain't got any other family or nothin', no? Nah. Come on, you must have an aunt or a gran or something? No. What about a neighbour? We just moved. [tv] I'm not running after her, I think she's left very happy... You want some more? Yes, please. [tv] Just the same lesson that I say all the time, this should have been done a lot sooner... [Jade giggles] He is in, right? Hello! Mate, I got your daughter here. [Jake sighs] Go through the back? [Jake] Hello. Hello? You'll never wake him. [shouts] Wake up! See? Mate, wake up. Mate... Right, go and play upstairs, yeah? Just, um, go and play with your toys upstairs in your room, okay? And don't come down. Mate, mate, wake up! - Mate! - [snorts] That's it, wake up, mate. Wake up! [retches] [Jake] Oh! You're all right, you're all right. - You all right? - [splutters] What you doing, mate? What the fuck are you doing? I'm not here to fight you, man! What the fuck is wrong with you, bruv? Mate, I'm not here to fight with you. Mate... mate... - Chill out, mate! - [groans] Mate? Don't, no... Don't come in. Don't come in yet. It's all right, your dad's asleep, innit. Just stay there. Stay there, Jade. All right, don't come in, okay? We're gonna go back to my place now. Listen, right. You gotta promise me, you can't tell anyone that I was there, all right? I promise. Just our little secret. [indistinct hum of conversation] I'm just saying, there's a certain level of respect that goes with my name, and if you're associated with me close enough, you know, that's gonna come on to you as well. What does that even mean? I mean, when people see me walk down the street, they know who I am... - Listen to this one! - I'm joking! I'm joking. I'm joking. I'm telling you, he's on his way. He'll be here soon. I've tried calling him. [hum of indistinct conversations] - It's messier now. - Come on. [squeaking] [whispers] What you doing? What are these? Whoa! They're not for little girls to play with. Right, let's get you ready for bed, yeah? I haven't got my jim-jams. There you go, just wear those. All right. Just put these on, and I'll wait outside. All right? You ready yet? [Jade] Not yet. [exhales deeply] All right, let's get some sleep, yeah? Come on. I need Muffin. You've just eaten! No, Muffin, my teddy. - Your teddy? - Yeah! Well, you probably left it in your house, innit? We'll get you a new one in the morning, how about that? - I can't sleep without him. - You'll have to 'cause he ain't here. - I can't. - [Jake exhales deeply] There you go, look at that. That's perfect, innit? All right, get some sleep. Come on, just have a little sleep. All right? I'll switch the light off. - I need a story. - You're havin' a laugh. Who used to tell you stories? Mum. All right. Look. I haven't got any books. ...so the little dude and his mate had to take the ring to the volcano place, all right? And that was miles away. So they're waking and walking, but the dragon-eyeball-monster thing, right, he wanted it as well 'cause it was so expensive and shit. So this massive battle happens, right. There's little dwarves with axes, and people fighting and punching. There's like this gay blond elfin guys... Elves. Yeah, them as well. And then they're just all fighting and fighting... Why? I don't know! 'Cause... to protect the little guys. Why? 'Cause they were littler than them, and they needed protecting. And they had the ring and there's only one of them. It's magic and gold and shit. All right? So they had this massive battle, and it all worked out, all right? Yeah, now go asleep. Then what happened? [sighs] Then they won the battle, and they took the ring, and they pawned it, and they made a lot of money. All right? Now go to sleep, please. That's it. - Then what happened?! - [Jake sighs] [exhales deeply] [Jake's dad] It's either a ditch or the nick for people like us. [phone rings] [phone continues ringing] - [whispers] Hello. - [Alfie] Yes, brother. Where you been hiding? You got a disappointed girl there, man. What? [Alfie] Where you been? Wait, where are you? Look, we're walking up now. Answer your phone, dickhead. Wait! Don't come back. I need to tell you something. I need to tell you something. Mate, we're here, all right. [coughs] N...

Look, mate, I need to tell you something, all right? [laughter] Oi-oi! How you doing? All right, babe. How you feelin'? Not very well... [softly] Shit. You all right, Kim? Hey. Don't fuckin' "hey" me. You invite me out, you don't fuckin' show up, you don't answer your phone, all night, nice. [softly] Keep your voice down. Really? Right, well, we'll leave you two to, um, talk it out. Mmm. We'll talk properly in the morning, yeah? All right, cool, man. See you later, mate. Mmm. I'm all right, I'm all right. [Alfie] There you go. You gonna be all right, babe? Yes, she'll be fine. He'll call her a taxi, won't you, when... I just want your opinion on this. [she giggles] You gonna call me a taxi or what, then? Yeah, sure. What happened your eye? Oh, nothing, nothing. I just... Hey, your arm's all fucked up as well. Oh, I just took a tumble earlier. Come on, tell me what happened. No, no, it's fine. It's nothing, I'm all right. [imitates him] I'm all right, you should see the other guy. [snorts] Don't even... What? You murdered him, I bet. So what's your excuse then? I'm not like one of your little skanks you can just treat like shit, you know? No, no, I know. I'm sorry. It's just been a mad day. I only came out 'cause she wanted your mate. And you're quite fit. Quite fit? [groaning from upstairs] - [groaning intensifies] - [Jake snorts] [loud groaning continues] [they both laugh] Sounds like... Sounds like she got what she wanted. Yeah... Do you want some? No, not of that. Oh, I think I've got some... God, you are an idiot. Don't think you're off the hook, by the way. - [Jade giggles] - Fuck. What? What are you doing awake? - Oh, my God! - We're just... It's just... Go back to bed, all right? [Jake] It's okay. [whispers] What the fuck, Jake. All right, enough, little lady. Come on, let's go. Cock block. What? Nothing. Get into bed, come on. All right, let's get some sleep, yeah. - Jake? - What? Will you protect me? [sighs] Shut up. Yeah, 'course. Just get some sleep, all right? Don't come in again. Oi! I'm sorry about that. Where you going? Got my own cab, thanks. [groans] I, I'm sorry about that. She didn't see much. She didn't see much? She saw everything! What are you doing with a little girl staying in your bed, anyway? She's just staying here for a bit. She's like... That's why I was on the couch. That's why I didn't come out tonight. Where's her mum? She's dead. Oh, right. Well, where's the dad? - He's not around. - So who the fuck looks after her, you? No, 'course not. Look... It's all a bit new, yeah? God, if you're some kind of a fucking paedo, I swear... What the fuck? 'Course I'm not. - Sorry, Jake. - 'Course I'm fuckin' not. - All right, sorry. - Fucking hell. It was just a bit of a shock. She's got no-one, all right? - What, she's got no other family at all? - No. [Kim exhales] So where is the dad then? He's... [car approaches] [Jake] All right, mate. [driver] All right. I'm sorry, I'll call ya, all right? Whatever. You got what you wanted. Fucking hell, hardly. Make sure she gets home safe, all right. - Will do, mate. - I've got my own money, you know? Yeah, I know. I'm sure you do. I've got a real job, unlike whatever it is that you and Alfie do. All right. I'll call you, all right? Sure. Well, good luck finding her dad, anyway. [softly] Cheers. [exhales deeply] [Jake whispering] Shh, it's all right. [Mary sighs] - Morning, Mary. - I'm so late. Have they started yet? ...All the overtime has been... [mouths] Sorry. Sorry. [woman] That's okay. ...has been suspended. As I'm sure you've heard, we are expecting further funding cuts across the board. Some departments will have to be restructured, so please bear with us while these changes take effect. [radio] Good morning, you are listening to... [Alfie] Jakey, are you cooking us breakfast? Sure. Where's Killer Kim? She left. Well, how long did she stay? Long enough to leave. What happened to your eye? [sighs heavily] I need to talk to you about something. [Leanne] Morning. Hold on, yeah? - All right. - All right, babe. Is Kim still asleep? Um... How about we go... Um, Jake... ...why is there a little girl dressed as Superman in our living room? Oh, right, are you awake? You got dressed. All right. Everyone, this is Jade. Um, Jade, this is Alfie. This is Leanne. Remember our promise, yeah? Best behaviour, all right? This is my little cousin's kid. I didn't know you had a cousin. Which foster home was that from? Um, just the one before I met you, I think. Yeah, she's... Her dad's not very well. So she's going to be staying with us for a bit. - He's asleep. - Yeah. So... Yeah. Anyone hungry? Who's hungry? Me. Cool. You hungry? Yeah. You wanna eat some food? Cool. [Leanne scoffs] I like your outfit. [Alfie] Lee, babe, do you want a cup of tea? I want a cup of tea. [laughs] All right. What the fuck are you doing bringing a fucking brat to the flat? All right, leave it out. She's having a rough time of it. A rough time? Yes, a rough time of it, all right? Her mum's dead. - And? - And, she ain't got no-one. So? So, I thought you might understand. She ain't got no-one. So what? Are you gonna be her new dad now? - Of course not. - All right, good. Have you forgotten what it is that we do for a living. We can't have the fucking social sniffing about. I know. I'm not fuckin' stupid. 'Cause we are on the fucking cusp. I spoke to Simon Flowers. - What? - Yeah. Sorted the whole thing. I told you, I don't want anything to do with him, he's a fucking psycho. Well, he wants everything to do with us. Why? Mate, it's a small town. Competitive marketplace. He wants to sit down with you later today. - I'm not meeting him today. - Yeah, you are. 12 at the shop. I was gonna tell you last night. I hooked it all up, man. Obviously, I didn't know you were gonna bring Annie home, did I? I mean, shit, Jake. Why not take her to the meeting, eh? "Who's this?" I don't know, some fucking damaged kid that I found! [whispers] Simmer down! Fucking hell, shut up. All right. Sorry. - But you gotta lose the kid. - I know. She's gonna fuck up everything that we've worked for. - All our plans. - All your fucking plans. Mate, I'm happy how things are. I don't want to fuck it up, it's fine. What? You ain't Scarface. I told you, I don't want anything to do with that fucking psychopath. He's weird, he's fucking weird. [Leanne] Where's our breakfast, boys? [Leanne] Think one day you will, eh? [indistinct conversation between Jade and Leanne] [laughs] [chuckles] Listen, why are we arguing? It's your call, man. I just think he's a fucking lunatic. Right, well, mug him off. Fuck Flowers. Sit down with him, show respect, and say, "Thanks, but no dice this time. We just want to do our own thing." You sure? - Yeah, 'course. - Cool. But, um... ...Jake... ...gotta lose the girl. I know. I know. You won't like prison food. Dig in. Jade? - Where are your toys? - Muffin! I forgot about Muffin. Now look what you started. [Leanne] What? [Alfie] Look. Oh, where is he? At my house. - Well, it's all right. I mean... - Need Muffin. [Leanne] I'm sure Jakey can go pick him up. [Jake] Fucking hell, mate. Need Muffin. [Jade] Need Muffin. I can't go... I need Muffin! - I'll get you another one, all right. - I don't want a new one. Need Muffin. Need Muffin. Need Muffin. - [Jake] We'll get you a new one. - Need Muffin. All right, we'll get him! All right? I'll get it. All right? Stop crying. Okay? All right? I promise. Just eat your food now, yeah? All right, you wait here, yeah? I'm gonna run in and grab Muffin, all right. Okay. [door slams] Hello there. Do you remember me? Hmm? My name is Mary. [softly] What have you got there? A worm. Oh. Does it have a name? Um, Wiglet. And do you know if it's a boy worm or a girl worm? Um, I think it's a girl. 'Cause it's stretching. It's nice to see you. I'm just going to knock on the door to see if your dad's in. Do you want to come with me? Um... Or stay there? [clanging] See you in a little while. Okay? Oh! [chuckles] - Hello. - Hi. Mary-Anne Johnson. I'm Jade's social worker. - Can I speak to her dad, please? - Her dad? Yeah, yeah. Is he in? - No, he's not in at the moment. - That's odd. We've got an 11 o'clock appointment. He usually likes a good moan. So, um, who's looking after Jade? - I am. - And you are? - Alfie Fisher. - Alfie. - Her cousin, yeah. - Her cousin? - Yeah. - Don't take me away from him! He looks after me much better than Daddy does. - Oi. - Oh, does he? - She's funny, in't she? Look what I found. - Muffin! Yeah. We were just on our way out. We're gonna go to the, um... The beach. Yeah, the beach. Would you like to come? I'd love to, but I've got far too much work to do. Look, I really do have to see her dad. Maybe I should just go and wait for her dad... I think she just really wants a nice day out, you know? She really wanted to go to the beach. I mean, my girlfriend's going to be there as well. She's got a really good job and everything. She's... She's... You know, a safe pair of hands. Not that I'm not a safe pair of hands, but she's a girl, so, you know, that helps and that. Go on, then. I'll come by tomorrow. Here's my card. In case of any problems, give me a call. Oh, thank you. Okay, I'll look after her, yeah. Gave me a fuckin' heart attack. When did I say we were going to the beach? - Are we still going? - Yeah... Oh, oh, excuse me. Sorry, sorry. Um, just noticed I haven't written down your last name or your address. Oh, right, yeah, sure. It's, um... [phone rings] - Alfie Fisher. - Yeah. And it's 24 Wellington Crescent. I better take this, it's probably girlfriend. - She's waiting for us at the beach. - All right. - Oi, give me the phone. - Hello! Look after each other. [Jake] Give me the phone. [on phone] Hello, who's this? It's a man's voice. - Hello? - Who am I speaking to? - Who's that? - It's about a bouquet for a Jacob. - What? - Aren't you Alfie's mate, yeah? Simon Flowers here, the florist. You wanted some flowers. Yeah, um... Yeah, I'm just on my way now to you... - Excellent. - I got delayed. Um, to discuss the arrangements. Is it for a wedding or a funeral? [laughs] What? You can tell me when you get here, eh? All right. Was that your dad? No. I'm fuckin' telling ya, he won that last fight. No, I think it was the other one. He threw that one for us. No, he won that fight. It was the one after. - No, no. - I'm pretty sure. Oi, Tel! Did you win that last fight? [Tel] Fuck off. Now, now, Terry. Listen, I don't know anything about your stupid fucking boat. [Tel groans] Fuck. I'm pretty sure he lost that fight. He's lost all his fights all his life. Why don't you let me out of this chair, see what happens, eh? You hear that? You fancy getting in the ring with Tel? [laughter] I'll tell you what. All right, all right. And in the red corner... What we gotta do? Right then. Do you have the Amsterdam connections? Fucking hell, no. - No? - No. - Well, then who has them? - I don't know. I don't fucking know. - You don't know? - No. Is it his son, Jake? No, no. Guys, I want a nice, clean fight. [splutters] I've got kids in my class that hit harder than that. [phone rings] I like you. I like this guy. - No, nothing. - Is that the Florist? Let me speak to him! Let me speak to him! [Tel coughs] Maybe. Okay. Okay, let me speak to him. - He wants to talk to you. - Does he? [Tel groans] [whimpers] [bell chimes] All right, mate? No, no, come on. Come on, don't be silly. [whispers] Some people. - Jacob? - It's Jake, yeah. [chuckles softly] Fucking do the other one. Just got rid of an employee. So your timing is perfect. Yeah, the thing about that is... You got the right entrepreneurial flair that we need. Business is booming. In't that right, Dad? [scoffs] God knows why in this shit old town. Everything else is dying. Do you know why? 'Cause the dead need blood. What'd you say, you freaky old bastard? Just leave him be. Fucking leave you be. Sitting around all day in me mum's coat. She's dead. Get over it. I want to make you top man. Consolidate our ventures. Triple our profits. Ha... all right. [Flowers laughs] I think you got the wrong end of the stick here, I can't, um... What'd you say? I'm just, um... Look, I'm flattered and everything... [Flowers laughs] He's flattered! I'm not asking you out on a date, mate. I don't know what Alfie said, but he misspoke. We're getting out of the game for a little bit. Look, I think... Why don't you think what I fucking tell you to think?! [bell chimes] Wow! Look at all the pretty flowers. I thought I said to you wait outside? Hello, little lady. Can I help you? No. It's all right, she's with me. Yeah. He protects me. [Flowers] Really? [Jade] Yes. Really. He can try. She's a live one, in't she? Hey, listen, why don't I show you what we do at Stems, eh? Here you are, little 'un, that's for you. - [Jade gasps] - Take it, go on, go. Now! Where you going? Oi! Careful, my flower! There's nowhere to go, boy. This is Margate. I thought we were going to the beach? We are, in a minute. Then what are we waiting for? I gotta meet some people. In a car park? Yes, in a car park. What do you want to be when you actually grow up? I am grown up! What'd you mean? - What'd you want to be when you grow up? - A singer. I don't sing. When my friends arrive, you need to go over there and hide, all right? Why? Because I told you to. Why? - 'Cause you're not supposed to be here. - Why? 'Cause you're not supposed to fucking be here, all right?! [Jade sighs] Are you a drug dealer? No! What you know about it? Nothing. Good. [incoming text alert] All right, they're coming now. Go on. - What's happening? - All right? - All good? - Mm. Not here, come on. Are you all right? [Jake] Yeah, why? How long did your pops get? Too long. Sore subject, yeah? Oi! [mobile vibrates] [softly] Oh, come on, come on. [vibrating continues] It's time, love. [exhales deeply] [sighs] Dad, it's Jake. I need you to call me back. Look, I know you're getting sent down today and everything, but I got serious shit going on, all right? I really need your help. Look, whatever happened between us, just look after yourself in there, yeah? Are you angry at me? What? No, 'course not. I just wanted to have a nice day. Will Daddy come back? Well, why don't we have the best day ever, yeah? We'll go on all the rides. We'll do anything you want. - Yeah! - Yeah? [indistinct chatter] [Jade squeals] ["Heartbreaker" playing] ♪ So take these hands ♪ ♪ They're bitten down to the nail ♪ ♪ A sign of how I've failed... ♪ [Jake] So you think I should, yeah? Yes! Call her. Say that you're sorry, say that you love her, ask to marry her, and ask to have the babies. I probably won't say that last bit. Hello. Can you swim? [Jake] Wow, look at this place. [Jade] It's a castle! Fuckin' hell. Welcome to the estate. Madame, Sir. Fuck me. Oi! Language, in front of the lady. Are you a princess? Yes. And so is Kim and so are you. And he, he's our servant. He's our prince. Yeah, I dunno about that. Okay, right, well, shall we get you a costume? - Yeah? - What about me? I'll sort you something out. Your lady's through there, Prince Charming. All right then, how 'bout it? Let's go upstairs. [Leanne] Pick some out. My last client was a no-show. D'you know, it's going to be a 'team around the child' issue soon. She's in the custody of a cousin called Alfie Fisher. [Mary] We've never seen him. [Val] Do you want me to pop over there and have a look? [Mary] Yeah, just have a look for me, will you, Val? [phone rings] Hello. Mary, it's Val. [Mary] Hi, Val. [Val] You better get over here. Jade's father's dead. [Mary] What? [Mary] Yeah. The little girl's missing. They're looking for this Alfie Fisher of yours. [Mary] Stay there, I'm coming. [exhales deeply] This is a bit of me. [Jake] It's nice, innit? In a year, mine will be bigger. Mate, half this would do me. Mate, I'm gonna have two places bigger than this. One for when I get bored of the other. Right! You goin' in the pool? Nah, mate. I got something better. Feel the love. Seriously? No, no, no, not here. [Alfie] Yeah, 'course here. Hey, ladies. [Alfie] Sweeties. Let's wait till she's in bed, yeah? - What is she still doing here? - [Jade] I like sweets. No, you don't. They're not sweets for you, he's just teasing. - Please! - Oh, you do. Alf, it's not funny. You should try one. You stay up all night. I won't, I promise. Oh, you will, I promise. - Alf. - Yeah, shut the hell up, mate. You guys are so mean. Let her have a sweetie. You want a sweetie, sweetie? Shut the fuck up. Shit, shit. No, no, no! - [Kim] Don't swallow it! - Fucking hell. Did you swallow it? I won't be angry. I just need to know if you swallowed it. - One, two, three, make yourself sick. - [Kim] "I need to go. I need to go." - [Leanne] I don't get... - [Kim] Not the time! We gotta go to A&E. - [Jake] Go, go, go. - [Leanne] Ring when you get there. - [Jake] Open the car. - [Alfie] Maybe I should stay. No! Fuck you, you twat! What are you gonna say when they ask what she took? I'll say she found them on a beach, thought they was sweets. Give me the fucking pills! Give me the pills! Mate, what the fuck is wrong with you? Get in the fucking car. Drive, just drive. [engine revs] You're gonna be all right. Help! [Jake] Hello? [Kim] Hello. Fill in one of these forms, please? Do I need to do it now? Can I do it later? All right, I'll hand it back in a minute. [Alfie] Mr Flowers, it's Alfie. No, look, I'm sorry. I thought... - Look, Jake fucked up. - [Jade crying] I dunno, he's got some kid with him. Whatever it takes. Yeah. We're at the hospital. Is she gonna be all right? She's gonna be fine. We're moving her to the children's recovery unit. Because of the nature of the emergency, the police are gonna have some questions for you. She'll be okay. I'm gonna make a phone call. - All right? - Yeah. I'll just be here. [voicemail greeting] You have reached Mary-Anne Johnson. Please leave your name and number, and I'll get back to you. Hi, Mary, it's Jake, the guy from earlier. Look, I've got Jade with me, right. I didn't take her or anything. But I just need you to just give me a call when you get this, all right. - There's... Um... - [tapping] [Flowers laughs] You Kimber'd that little girl, didn't you? No. Yes, you fucking did. I'm beginning to like you more and more, Jacob. Let's go for a walk. [hum of engine] Alfie here's been telling me you've been havin' a spot of bother. With a young lady and one of my pills. I didn't know you fucking stole her, did I, eh?! - I didn't though. - Shut up! Get in the fucking car, the pair of you. [Simon] Get down. Any time today would be good, yeah. Ha! The sea air. Get that in your lungs, boys, eh? They're going to be looking for you for a long time. I thought... I thought you said you were just going to talk to him. How long will we keep this game up, huh? Are you gonna pretend to beg for his life? "Oh, leave it out. He's my boy, he's my brother." - [Jake] Alf? - [Simon laughs] What? What? We could have owned this whole fucking town together. Yeah, but you want to spend your time saving some, some lost little girl. Well, who's gonna save us, huh? We did care together, mate. Yeah? You and me. The 'give a fuck' foster parents. The key social workers, the bored case workers, all the bollocks, yeah? And we, we survived it. We, we survived it. And we were gonna build something for us. And we were gonna be in charge for once, and now you want to go and fuck it all up! Well, no! No! No. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but no. I... I am owed this! [Simon clapping] Bravo. You should have gone on The Apprentice, boy. [Alfie whimpers] [gunshot] - [Jake retches] - Alfie, you're fired. An ambitious little cunt. You need to tell me who your dad's supplier is. Then you can make employee of the month. My apprentice... [laughs] You can't just leave him there. I tell you something about the Old Bill round here, they're fucking stupid. I should know, I used to be one! [laughs] Now that's criminal, eh? [Flowers gasps] Where you going?! You're a wanted man! Try and do someone a fucking favour. [Jake] Are you alone? [Mary] Oh, Jesus, you scared me. Swear you didn't bring the police, yeah? [Mary] No, I didn't. Though God knows why. Look, I need you listen to me and know that I only ever tried to do the right thing here, okay? They never believe people like me, they never do, but you've got to believe me. - All right? You've got to believe me! - Okay! What d'you think you're doing? I just wanted to do the right thing for once. And now it's all fucked up. They're gonna say I did all these things I didn't do. Okay, okay, calm down. [Mary] Tell me what happened. I'm trying to help you, but her father's dead. I didn't mean any of this to happen. He was a drunk and he slipped. I just wanted to give her one day. You have to believe me, all right, it was an accident. All right. Calm down. Now where is Jade? Hi. Oh, hi, sorry. Is she okay? - Um... - I'm her dad. Oh, right, God, sorry. Yeah, yeah. No, she's okay, she's just a bit shook up, yeah. I mean, I would have come earlier, but I got held up at work. Have you seen Jake about at all? Um, he's probably running around somewhere. Um... listen, can I have a moment alone with my daughter? Yeah, sure, of course. I'll be outside. Thanks a lot, lady, I really appreciate it, cheers. Hello, my little flower. Jake! Where have you been, Jake, the police were here. What did you say? - Where's Jade? - She's with her dad. - What? - Her dad came to see her. Jake, what's wrong? Jake! Well, where is she? She was just there. With her dad, she was just there. Come on! Right, that's it, stop, stop! I'm calling the police. - What? No, no, no. - I'm calling the police. No, don't. If you call the police, we'll never see her again, all right? Don't call the police, I know where she'll be. [both] Where? - Doesn't matter, you don't know this guy. - Who is he? It doesn't matter, let me go, I'll bring her back. Where are you going? I'll text you when I'm there, then ring the police. - I'll drive. - I promise. [bell chimes] What have you done? What you doing up? Thought you were sleeping. I brought some company. She'll be all over the fucking news. You hear that? You're gonna be famous. Why have you brought her here? I want you to take her back. Do we have to have that talk again, Dad? [Jade] What's going on? Nothing, my darling, nothing. Come with me. Where's your clothes? Here y'are. Through there. [Jake breathes heavily] Jake, you've got to tell the police. It's all too late for that now. Well, what you gonna do? [Kim] Oh, Jesus. If she's not out in ten minutes, call this number. All right? Okay. Call this number if she's not out in ten minutes! You can't just waltz in there. What else am I going to fucking do? Look, I'm sorry. At least hide it, all right? All right, all right, okay. Be careful, please. All right? I'm sorry. [Jade and man chat quietly] [Jade] I might... Can't you shut her up? [man] There you are, my darling. [bell chimes] [door slams] What a hero. Is that your, um, backup? Where is she? Told you there's nowhere to run. - Just give me the girl back. - No. I think I'll keep her. Get 'em young, ship 'em out. - Just give me the fucking girl. - [Jade] Jake! Oi! Just us. Businessman and his apprentice. How many times have I gotta fucking tell you, I don't want to be your apprentice. - [Flowers screams] - [Jade] Jake! - [gunshot] - [Jade] No! [they grunt] [Jade] Jake! [gunshot] I'm sorry, son. He wasn't always like this, Lily. [sirens wail] Walk with the flowers. Walk with the flowers. [Jake softly] You all right? [sirens intensify] [gunshot] [man over megaphone] Just let the girl go. Step away from the door. He didn't take me! Jake, what are we gonna do now? You need to go out there now, all right? [over megaphone] Let the girl go. Come on. All right? You're gonna be all right, you. Okay? What happened to that brave girl I first met, eh? That one? You just need to go out there. What would Supergirl do? Go on, that's it. [bell chimes] [Jade] Not without you. [indistinct man over megaphone] [Jade] No! Just leave him! He didn't do anything! He didn't. He didn't do anything! It's okay. You're all right.
