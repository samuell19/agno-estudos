Subt?tulos ripeados por Leonnos Argentina, 2017 ? apolocinegay TRUE BLUE Who gave a knife to the boy? It's okay, darling. What can I say? There's nothing I can say. I'm going to kill you! - Hold on, my love. Just a moment. - Mummy. I don't know where to begin. "Had enough?" I ask this "sensitive" guy. He just stares. I knew he wanted to complain... Listen to this. "Do you like the food?" I growl at him. The others nod, willing him to say "yes". He looks at me and says in a squeaky voice "Well, considering it's evening..." - Why's he crying? - He cut himself. Don't cry. What sort of man will you be? Where should I begin? At the end? At the beginning? Mum, I'm going to Paris. - To do what? - To work. I've got friends there. What about the ships? You said you were going back. You said that I'm never going back on board. I don't want to be a cabin boy. It's not me. - I'm going to be a dancer. - Do whatever you think. I've got no money for Paris. So why make me go and see that shipping guy, then? You wanted to do that. My friends have got me a job there. - Dad wouldn't have let you. - Tough, he let himself be shark bait. Stuff the family tradition. Shut up or I'll make this your shroud. That would please me more. You're not going to Paris. These are the documents for the pension. It's reduced, he didn't have enough years' service. Good Lord, where did you get those clothes? I hid them when I became a widow. Why were you poking around? What did you do to the boy? - Where did you get these? - He did it. Watch your son, he'll disgrace my brother's name if you mollycoddle him. Send him out to work at an early age, like my brother would have. Like our father did. That will set him straight I'm in pain. Good evening. Forgive me, but... Oh, but you must be Yorgos's mum. You look so alike. I'm staring at Georges in female form. Congratulations, madam, you are very beautiful. My respects. He's a friend of ours. Mr. Thibaut. He got me the job. He helped Annette when she first got to Paris from Denmark. Thank you for all you've done for my son. Pleased to meet you. She's thanking you for what you've done for me. We're going. Let's go, Mum. I won't come up, I need to discuss the tour with Gerard, he's financing it. Don't worry, Annette will look after you. Look after my mother. Take good care of your mother-in-law. Madam, it has been a pleasure. Good night, or rather good day. Welcome to Paris. See you tomorrow. Take the big bed, Annette can sleep on the sofa. Don't worry, she fits. Get some rest, tomorrow I'll take you shopping. I must admit, they looked after me. The girl even brought me breakfast in bed. She couldn't do enough Treated me like a queen. I stayed four days. Poor Yorgos was so busy at the office. He'd come back late, eat and go to bed. All day with the daughter in law, I didn't understand a word. Bless her, she put me on the plane to come home. She bought me the blouse Kalliope's got on. She said "Don't worry about the colour, it suits you. You're still young." Yorgos translated. But I gave it to my Kalliope. What would the neighbours think? They're used to my widow's weeds. It's dark, I'll be off. Thank you. My boy's well, thank the Lord. He'll visit me in summer, if he gets time. - Well, welcome back and... - Be sure to tell your husband. My son is honoring his brother's name. Don't let him wear your shoes. He can if he wants to, your son did. Pick on your son, not mine. Mine was smart. His were childish pranks. Mine's smart too and if not it's a family trait. Shrew. - You are. - You're the shrew! - You are. - Let him be or I'll belt you. - He teased me. - Let him do his homework. Why? He doesn't go to school. - What do you mean? - I saw him after class. He came from the river, eating chocolate. Chocolate? Where did you get the money? - I won at footie cards. - You told Dimitri a man gave it to you. - Man? What man? - The one with the motorbike. - Motorbike? Where were you? - School. Lies! - Your uncle will know where you were. - School, I said. - And the chocolate? - I just got it. What was I to do with that boy? I tried everything. Take him out of school? Send him to his uncle to work? So young? I was just thinking about you. I came a day earlier. Welcome home. Where's your wife? She sails in tomorrow. I wrote you. Planes scare her. I smelled it from the street, fried eggplant. What are you worried about? Move on from the old times. - Can I get you some more? - No, I'm stuffed. - When are your daughters due back? - Tomorrow. Same as your wife. We didn't expect you. They're at Kalliope's husband's village. You told me. Nice holidays. I'll make the big bed for you two. I over-ate. Just like your father. You remind me of him so much when you eat. He sometimes brought friends home for dinner. I'd spy on him from the kitchen. Mum! - What's for dinner? I brought a friend. - I don't know, son. I haven't cooked. I haven't seen you for two days, I didn't expect you. I'll cook some eggs and tomatoes for you. - Who's he? - A friend. See that you look after him. - Salad too. Is there any wine? - Sure, whatever you brought. - Was that your arse talking? Cover up. - You cover yours. - Put a sock in it. - Take yours out! Don't let her get to you. You know what she's like. What did you say your name was? Do you dance with Yorgos? - He worked at his uncle's furniture... - But not anymore. They fell out. You know what uncles are like. Where's the tablecloth, Mum? - The good one's dirty, use a sheet. - And deprive you of a cunt rag? - I want some money, Mum. - Don't have any, son. When I get the pension in three days, I'll give you some. Give me what you've got. - Here you are. - What's that? It's all I have, the electricity's due tomorrow. - Give that to your daughter's pimp! - Mind your mouth. Give him the pay he gave you this month as head of the family. He's the man, so he calls the shots. My family takes cock. If you like, come up. I'll do you for 500. I'm a poofter. If you want to fuck me, third floor. Don't hide. Press the doorbell, with no light. Well, here we are. My sister Ismini. The youngest one in our family. - This is Annette. - Hello. Welcome. Please come in. Come in. - It's hot. - Hot! Hot! Would you like an orange juice? Sour cherry juice? Orange juice? Just a glass of water, please. I didn't want to disturb you. Disturb? Not at all. We're used to it. It's open house. Yorgos often brought friends home for dinner. Welcome. Kalliope, my older daughter and my grandkids. - My older sister and her kids - Look who's here! Welcome. Did you see Uncle Yorgos? Aunty Anna. Say hello to Aunty Anna. - Around the other side. - Leave me alone. Welcome. I don't speak French so Yorgos will tell you. How was the trip? Do you like Greece? Athens? Our sister in law. Do you like Greece? What about Athens? Yes, a lot. Even too much. - Is you hair dyed? - Another French woman in the family. - What's your husband say? - She's not French. - Danish. - French. She lives in Paris, doesn't she? Which do you prefer? Here or Paris? Here, yes? Good here. Sun and sea. There's no sea in Paris. My brother. He's a good guy. Handsome. - Stop gushing. - A tad testy. Temper, temper. Don't touch what's not yours! He's naughty, just like Yorgos when he was a kid. Yorgos was so naughty. He'd get into Mum's suitcases and wear her clothes. Put those down. Do they suit me? Hasn't it stopped yet? - Aren't they awake? It's 1:30. - I'm setting the lunch table. It stopped after you called. This is just in case. This has gone on every day for two months. They're out all night and sleep all day. I cleaned up her vomit again yesterday. She just left it under the bed. You'd think she was pregnant. I've had it. All he says is "what's for dinner"? How can I afford it? - The pension went in ten days. - I'll talk to him. No, don't. It will only cause trouble. Listen here... before you wash... Thank you. I'll see them. What's the place they live in? - A friend's flat. - How do they live? He can't even afford smokes. What does he do? She's broke too. She was fired from modeling. How can they afford three-month holidays? Stop that before you do damage. I told you to stop it! I'm going back upstairs, Mum. Come on. Come on, we're going home. Come on, I said. Daddy's on his way. Let's go. Who is it? She's not feeling well. I'm late. I'll bring them back the day after tomorrow when Ismini's not home. - What do you think you're doing? - Do you mind, lady? - Leave these boys alone. - Mind your own business. Officer, come here, please. Something's going on... Why are you fighting? Stop it. Stop fighting. I told you to stop it. He's the man with a dog. What happened to you? What have you done now? Must I go to the police again? So what sort of punishment do you propose? Why don't you talk? Why did he beat you up? Annette, forgive me but it's so funny. I can't explain properly. You wouldn't understand that kind of story. It's difficult to explain. It's humor. Hi, Yorgos. Don't you recognize me? We were at school together... in Kallithea. I'm Dimitris. But of course... you're Dimitris. It's been donkey's years. I hear that you live in Paris. - What about you? - Me? I work at the bank. Ah yes, Mum told me. We're old now, eh? Let me introduce my fianc?e. This is Yorgos, an old school mate. We're so old now. Pleased to meet you. This is Annette, my fianc?e, and a friend of ours from Paris. - Staying long? - That depends. So... good to see you. We're old? Speak for yourself and the ugly bitch you're dragging around. She's dragging him around! From Paris, my foot! What made you say that? Rotten snitch. Closet fag. Let's go. You'll come and tell me you'll never find a woman as good as me. No matter how hard you look, you'll give up before you can find her... Tonight, I want you to give me another drag, a cigarette to smoke now that I've given up the fags. Get up and dance a zeibekiko, for me and me only I want to hear you talk to me about things forgotten. And don't try to tell me that you can't do everything my heart desires... Leave her alone, she doesn't want to. Leave her, I say. But why? Annette, open up. Not again! Why, Lord? Why? Not again. He slit his wrists again. Why won't he tell me what's wrong? Why is he doing these things? It saddened me to see him in this state. But what could I do? I was flailing alongside him in a storm. I gave him everything. I stood by him as a mother. Whatever he asked for, I did. He had everything. He never went without. I did, but he never did. I'm going to start my own business, Mum. I need money. Lend it to me and in five months, I'll pay it back double - I don't have any, son. - Sell the unit in Koukaki. That's for your youngest sister's dowry. Didn't I tell you? I'm taking her with me. I'm sick of being used. The Bournelli troupe offered me peanuts. Dance in Greece! I'm going away for six months. Abroad. A friend's organizing it. You won't be sorry. Well, it's a fact, no one can cook eggplant like you. No more, I'll get fat. Sell the house and see how our life will change. I want a good rehearsal. Listen to the music. Rhythm, feel the rhythm. That won't do, not even for Beirut. They'd stop the war to laugh at you. Much better. Let's go, my lovelies. Ismini, you too. Come on, darl. Good, let's do hands, now. In time. Listen to the music. Smile, ladies. Give me enthusiasm, brio. That's it. Lovely. Stop doing your own thing, Ismini. Let's go. Be lively. Come on, Ismini. For heaven's sake. Let's go. We'll stay two weeks. We can't stay longer, we're booked for Tehran. If they insist, we can drop in on our way back. By then the troupe will have shrunk. The emirs will have kept half the girls for their harems. Too funny. Oh, thank you. I can't touch it just yet. Hold it for me a bit longer. - What a scent. - Scented soap. I'll give mine to Mum. She had a big plant, but it died. She grew it for Yorgos, he loves gardenias. I love all fine things. I have done since I was a kid. Whereas you tarts preferred the smell of detergent. I'm stuffed. Pass me the water bowl. Delicious meal. Praise the Lord. See what a God fearing family we are. We got it from Mum. - Like mother, like son. - Silly girl. - Shall we ask for the bill? - It's okay, I'll pay. We're staying a while. Don't be late for rehearsal tomorrow. Good night, Kyprianos. Thank you. Okay, get up. I'll catch you later. I'll see Mum tomorrow, want anything? The yellow shirt I gave her to wash. At least he didn't give her his panties. He probably keeps those for Polycarpos's fetish. Hey! Your daughter Cleopatra and your son the Pharaoh have just come from the Pyramids. What a sunset, Mum! We're exhausted, but it's worth it. We're a big hit. We're working towards getting Kalliope's diamonds. Forget our neighborhood and look for a penthouse downtown. Yorgos is away, running around booking shows. Missing you, your European artistes toiling for you. Yorgos has been ill. The things he's been through!!! Don't say anything to Mum. More bad luck, all our costumes and sets were lost in a fire. With God 's help it will all turn out fine. Take care. Mummy. Don't you recognize us? It's Yorgos. - What happened to you, son? - The sun bleached it. You've lost weight. Were you ill? You're pale. You weren't eating properly. The food there was... boy, oh boy! Nothing like your eggplant dish. - So how do your black fellas look to you? - Blond! This is great, Mum. All I want from now on is fish. - Like our Greek star Vougiouklaki... - Of Arabia. Hang on, I've got one in the freezer. Look at the work on this. - Nah, it's off the rack. - We got them at the bazaar after all. There's one you'll like in the other suitcase. Not that one... the striped one. That's an authentic caftan, all done by hand. What lovely colours! Does it suit me? - Going out? - I told you, until I stop, I'll be going out. It's summer, nets are being cast, she wants to cast some of her own. Just keep your nets away from mine, we don't want a pile up. - Don't stay out all night. - We've been through this. And so begins the round of death. - Here you go, son. - Thank you, Grandma. Still asleep? It's almost night. - He slept at ten and she at twelve. -In the afternoon? He'd been swimming. This has gone on over a month. - They get up, shower... - No coffee, Mum? They go out separately. One's awake. I forgot to buy some. I hid some instant. Did you see it? We have to hide everything. You here, Kalliope? First in best dressed, I see. - There's Turkish coffee. - I'll have some, but it doesn't wake me up. Make me a coffee while I shower. Any sort will do. - Don't! Let her do it. - She's as bad as the foreign woman. - It's your fault. - Stop your screeching. You here too? Is there any coffee, Mum? That cow got to it first again. Get me a glass from the sideboard. Good boy. You can ma?tre d' at my club. Give us a kiss. Leave him alone! Don't worry, it's not contagious. You either have it or you don't. Hours in the sun haven't bleached your roots like in Arabia. I've been too broke to pay the sun. Your hair needs doing too. Your roots are showing. I'm never dyeing it again. - Is he thinking of going to work? - As if that will happen! He argues with everyone. No one's ever good enough for him. Everyone exploits him. - Why did he leave the last place? It was fine. - That was a month ago. It's always "tomorrow" with him. He lasted three days. Who knows what sort of hissy fit got him fired. - He'll never get a job. - Worry about yourself. - I'm a woman. - So get married. It'll happen, all in good time. Try that new club in Plaka. They're looking for new acts. It's packed every night. Since the clientele stays the same the program has to change each month. You know how to dance. If I knew how, I'd quit all this. Hot thighs, but everything above sucks. Okay, don't freak out. You got rid of yours, now you want ours? So why did you cut it off? Anyway, we prefer the one in men's clothes, the lesbian. - Tell her to be at Cantina at three. - You too. No scissors! Fuck you, prick. You want a chick with dick to suck off. Go home and jerk off your daddy's cock. Sorry if we ruined your sex change plans. Look, you know how to dance... All you need to do is put on a frock. Dress like a woman, you know. I know a few post-ops there. You don't know them. Why did he quit working on boats? What's that? We've been through this. Now he looks for work among perverts and psychos. Still not over it, Mum? Don't tell me he's here already. On my way. I'm going, Mum. Don't forget the eggs. So be it, Holy Mother. You're marrying that idiot? So he can take our home? Now this cop wants our home to deal aspirin. He badmouths fags but rips them off, selling condoms to poofs, junkies and hopheads. You want that sorry cock to marry into our family? He's a pimp and we pay each time he comes without a condom and has a brat to carry on his line of pharmacists. He can come in other cunts. Leave my sister's alone. She's a slut like me, medication won't change her. He's not using my home to park his clunker. Not the one he drives, nor the one in his pants he can't get up. Wait and see what I'll do to him. Yorgos, what are you doing? Are you crazy? I'm calling the police. I'm going to kill you. I'll have you committed. Spew all you like, he'll marry me. He doesn't give a rat's about you. Don't worry, I'm doing you a favor. He'll be even hornier. He thinks he's tough and has balls? A poof will show him. Tell your pock faced son to keep out of my sister's cunt or else her faggot brother who's cock's bigger, will fuck him. The spider dick, male suppository. Leave her alone or I'll twist his guts with a knife. Bloody cop. You really know how to beat people up. Trying to prove you've got a big cock too? Pull it out, let's measure it instead of hitting me. Bloody cop. Arsehole. Motherfucker. When I was born, my mother was happy because I was, they say... a boy. She thought it would keep my father at home. But I knew, I could sense, he really liked women and I made it my mission to please him to convince him I wasn't born from my mother, but from his rib. Don't look at me askance, I didn't give him the apple, he took a bite all by himself. And he choked. There's no escaping Fate. Once again, a woman took him from her... the sea. But why didn't he remain at sea? I had no father to protect me, but I soon found one. But fathers have strange foibles. They put you on their lap and they shake you... until they groan. Then they toss you aside and you start to crawl. And once you start to crawl... But why didn't you stay at sea? Growing up, I didn't want a father, I preferred a brother. Equal to equal, but that never worked out because I got used to being compliant. - Even now, I'm in pain. - Even now? I grew even more. My mother didn't have a man and she wanted to make me one. For herself? Maybe. I left. I travelled the seas to bring him back to her, to lighten my load. - "Is Alexander alive?" I'd ask. - He's not. Every rock I passed, each wave that soaked me, said the same. I was forlorn, I thought he'd hidden. I dressed as a woman to tempt him. I began looking again. "Could it be you're my brother?" But no, I don't want Cain. It can't possibly be Cain. But if he were Abel, that would make me Cain. I gave it a try but in the end I'd give in first. No, I wasn't Cain. Again, dressed as a woman, I now sought a father and a brother. I met teachers, sailors, the learned, the unlearned, doctors, lawyers, greengrocers, mechanics, I even met my mum's brother, in Australia for years, on his first day in the harbor of his homeland. But I soon realized they weren't what I was looking for. Then, I went back to men's clothes to maintain the neutrality nature had bestowed upon me. What was I? I was bewildered. I had to find out where my hat had been hung since the hat was all I had left. In the end, I put it on my head and I became my mum. Then I began looking, as a mother now, because she was old and had given up. Then, I got to know me and I fell in love with myself. I wanted to be with me, care about me, look after me. But I, too, betrayed me and I annoyed me, attacking myself. I hit myself, swore at myself and others agreed that it was my fault. That's when I realized I never loved myself. Not truly, ever. Now I know myself and if you want to know me too hop on your motorbike and come and find me in the darkest corner of your being. You can't help but recognize me, I put on my mum's clothes so that you can. My brother and my father, it's me, Nemesis by name. Three sweet syllables... Ne-me-sis. You will come, you can't not come. We're celebrating 50 shows. Leave your make up on. Come as you are, or we'll be late. - It's carnival time after all. - Hello, it's Lent. But it's only the first week. Fasting's just begun and the punters want meat. - We're doing well. - Packed like sardines up to the bar. People want something new, different. Do that and they come. - Okay, everybody up. - Come on now, Fotis... Do we embarrass you? Ladies, we have a man! Where? If you're too shy to come alone, bring a friend. They know us where we're going, they won't mind. No, it's just... some of us have homes. - And we don't? - I don't, neither does Yorgos. - Yorgos does. My bedsitter is vacant now. - What, the basement in Koukaki? Did the rats move out? Come on, Yorgos, no one can tell what you are in that frock. - At least you shaved, unlike some. - I'll go home, change and meet you there. - I'll take you, we can go from there. - Trying to give us the slip? Okay, we get it. A harem to yourself, lucky you. So what if some are men? - Eunuchs. - Come, join our harem. Wear a veil, nobody will be able to tell you're a man. - Fine, let's go. - Good boy. I'll get my raincoat. Everybody out. Allez. Time for your debut. Blow their minds offstage too. I doubt you'll find many good minds out there. Get it right, you militant social worker. Anyone would think you're a tranny. - How do you know I'm not? - You can't afford it. Nor even to go to Casablanca for an op. You can't even pay to see the film. My love story, my sin... My greatest mistake. You're an illness inside of me in between my legs and how am I going to get you out? - Mr. Barman, pour us a drink. - Hands off, he's all mine tonight. - Don't be so loud, it's night time. - Fotis... Astraddle they to go to church, and pray when they straddle us. No praying at night, bitch! Grab a big candle on Epiphany and set it on fire. - Off to our second job now. - Multi-tasking. - Multi-tasking. - Multi-taskers. Good night. - We kept you up late. - Nah, I'm used to it. Good night. Thank you. Tomorrow. And then... he came along. - As did he. - And he. - Him too. - And him too. - All of you come, as long as you're with it. - As long as you've got it. - There is no discrimination. -Not for foe. - Nor for friend. - Just fuzzy kisses. All kisses. - If you give those, you get in. - You have your ticket. And then, he left. And if you're wondering what I'm left with... The diamonds, of course. And the Galanteria song. I say "Diamonds, of course" and "Galanteria". On "diamonds" he closes on my hands. At "Galanteria", kill lights, darkness, applause. Don't leave me hanging like that. You do it every night. I get the shakes and almost pass out. Answer me when I talk to you. Who sees you shaking? The two-and-a-half patrons there tonight? That's not your concern. I'm onstage. You try standing that long in stilettos. Fine, tell your boss to dock tonight's pay. So now she only owes me 32 days. A get rid of your dirty jocks. - They're mouldy after three days in the sink. - Oh, brother! Take the wash to your mum. The maid's away and this washer's through! We're finished! Why act like that? Aren't we good together? What do you want? I want you to leave. Go away. I don't want to know you. If you want a slave, get a woman. I'm a man, not a substitute because women don't turn you on. A year's enough. Your fianc?e can spend your money on whitegoods. You're a woman, not me. Mum knows about me and she's cool. I'm a man and I don't need a pimp. I'm going to bum you, you fucking poof. Get out! We're cancelling the show, guys. Get undressed. 11:30 and look at the place. Take care of it. Drinks on the house and get rid of them. I'll need to sell the flat. You know how it is. I owe money to my crew. The work here has died. Look elsewhere. I'm going back to Hamburg. Bottom line... Fotis was the only one who loved me. Stratos is right when he says you're certifiable. You've been saying that for a year now. You just won't learn. Isn't growing a fringe and having to wear a wig night and day bad enough? Spread out. - Fuck off, dickhead. - Chill, he's one of our mob. What's the time? Time for tripe soup. Shift's over. You're coming. But we'll stop off at yours first so I can change. Why did he come back to me again? I don't want him coming back to me. I don't. I liked it when he wasn't around. Why did he show up again? I changed neighborhood, I disappeared, and he's come back, just to humiliate me. I've sneaked in and out for two weeks now, to avoid people. I'm going to come back here. Those people don't know me. They don't know what I've been through. I'll move back near you. At least people love me here. No one has ever done anything to me, ever. Stay with me, I'll put you in my son's room. No! No. Not with the child. Stay here all summer, we're going away in a week. We'll be at Kosmas's village for two months. Stay here and then we'll see. Maybe he'll calm down, or you can come with us. Isn't this what you always wanted? I was expecting you. Give me your bag, I want to show off to Uncle. Call him so he can see how I've grown up. How I've aged. How like you I've become. I didn't give birth to him. He's not mine or your father's. He's not mine. He was swapped at the hospital. What sins did I commit to deserve this? Guard your son. Guard him. Mind they don't swap him in hospital and give you another child and tell you it's yours. Guard him. Guard him with your life. Never leave him on his own. I watched over mine, they took him, swapped him and said that was the one I gave birth to. They used a needle on me to take him. I never gave birth to a child like that. I only gave birth to you two. You and you. Oh why did I ever open my door to him again? Why did I let him in? Let me go! Don't. Let me go. No, no! My boy's not like that. He wouldn't. You're wrong. It was someone else. It wasn't him. As a kid we couldn't give him injections, he hates them. You've got the wrong person. He'd spit out aspirins. It's not him. It's not his fault. He's not a thief, he was led astray. He's honest. I brought them up well. I looked after my son. I know my son, he can't be led astray. I taught him well. Don't. Wait. Wait. My son-in-law is a policeman. He has a rank. He's a commander. He's stationed at... He's innocent. My boy's clean. My Yorgos is innocent. He's innocent. Innocent. "Mum, the island's done me good. I'm calmer. "I do weaving and I tend the institute garden, "along with my friends here, when we're not playing ball." Read on, I wish I had my glasses. "We finished fixing up the old hall I've told you about. "It's ready. We painted it blue, like the dining-room at our old place. "Singers from Thessaloniki came yesterday and we had a party. "You wrote that you want to come here. "Don't come again. The trip is too tiring for you. "I'm fine and eating well. I miss you very much. Very much. "How are my nephews? Is the youngest walking or just kicking? "If he keeps it up, Ismini may not need to educate him, "she can make him a football player. "Kiss my sisters for me, I can't wait to see you all. "Sixteen months have just flown, "but the three weeks left until I get out seem like ages. "Kisses to you. Your son." At least, be thankful your boy's not impaired. That's good luck. - Give me your glass. - Pour me one and let's drink. - Here's to us. - Cheers. - Welcome. All the best to you. -Cheers. - Now with your cousin. - Let's clink glasses. With your other cousin now. - Uncle Yorgos too. - Clink with Uncle Yorgos. Good. Good luck for his new job. Say "good luck", darling. Bad luck. It's burning my hands! So what? It's worth it for the new house. Thanks to my baby brother. Amen, Holy Mother. Screw him. He can get fucked. What's going on with you? Did you put the price of aspirins up again? And upped your daily wage to a BMW? Behave! Your guy? He's here. Where else would he be? I'm looking at him. Your brother-in law is very cluey. Yes. The only problem is, he's very "sensitive". Chips, hot drinks, cakes, orange and lemon juice, Twisties... Keep it. Where have you been? Long time, no see. See you after? Dear daughter, take off Daddy's dress so he can go to work." You know how Litsa talks, nothing's changed, but for one thing. You left me single and now I'm married. Who'd have thought? Well, I have hit 35. At last you've cracked a smile. I almost didn't recognize you. Litsa had the operation. You heard? How could you hear? You dropped out of sight. She went to my doctor. She walks like she gave birth and can't close her legs. It's all those years of spreading them. Of course, at first it hurts a lot. I still remember. If it weren't for my husband, I wouldn't have done it I'm so glad to see you. You disappeared off the face of the earth. Not that I didn't, but I still hear things. Guess who I saw when I went for my wax... the madam. She's back from Hamburg. Yes, indeed. And listen to this idea, she opened a club in Crete. New morals, new traditions... The backwoods are turning hip, bitch! She's gone from Hamburg to Anogia and now to a straight bar at Vai Beach, "Dorothy Lamour", under the date palms. She's a silent partner and only goes to pick up the cash, she said. She's invited us in August when Stefanos closes his workshop. Why don't you come? Eh, Stefanos? We'll see the new show with the Cretan lasses. Would you want to work again? Me? Are you crazy? Me, singing again? "I'm going back to Arabia, I've heard tell there's a witch there who'll break your spell." Been there, done that. Been to Arabia, spell's broken, no more career. Now it's home and family, on Stefanos's earnings. God be praised, we want for nothing. Except for a child, but you never know, we may adopt. There are heaps of women who can't have kids. But Stefanos doesn't want one. "I prefer just us" he says. - You need a shave. - Good night, it was a pleasure. Thanks. Take some leave, let loose, you're withering away. You're looking pale. "Don't worry and don't complain, your own sorrow is the greatest pain." - Getting in, buddy, or not? - I'm sorry. Yorgos, wake up, son. You'll be late again. It's 7:15. Come on. Get up. Hang in there, you'll be on holidays in two weeks. You can sleep all you want when we go to Kosmas's village. Get up, it's a half day today. You can sleep in the afternoon. Come on, Yorgos, wake up. You'll lose your job. - You've been up late for three weeks. - I'm not going to school. Oh, Yorgos, Yorgos. You're going to lose your job. Rub oil on my back, please, Yorgos. Lower. Make my husband jealous. Flirt with me too. What great hands! Like a life saver's. Like oars or mooring cables, safe. Don't go in with your glasses on. Come on. No way, I just put lotion on. Now he's gone, light a cigarette so I can have a drag. Ah, freedom. Lose a father, find a father. It's the fate of a woman. It's like the Middle Ages. Science has progressed, but males still hold sway. I'm turning over, I'm sick of looking at soles. Seen any cute guys? I don't dare bat an eyelid, he'd kill me. It took me ages to break that habit, so I'm making the most of it now. Do you feel pleasure during sex? Look, that's what I'll be like when I'm old, but without the grandchildren. Do you feel pleasure? Of the ultimate kind. I'm a woman. - During love making? - Come here, sweetie. Are you a boy or a girl? - You didn't answer. - What? Do you feel pleasure? That's no question to ask a lady. So you're definitely not coming? Let's check out the Cretan girls' show. We said we'd go. My husband's waiting, we're late. Can I stay in your room? It's got sea views. You're not very nice. Stay as long as you like. Lord, he's cut himself. Come here. Who gave him the knife? I'll kill you, naughty girl. I'm getting your dad, you'll see. - Yannis, hurry, it's the boy. - I didn't give it to him, Mummy. He found it by himself. What happened? Let Daddy see. It's nothing. You're a grown man and you're crying? It's nothing. - Don't cry. - Take off my shoes, you'll ruin them. Put yours on so we can go. Grandma's expecting us. It's your fault too for leaving a knife out. How did the kids find it? You've made your decision. What can I say? I wasn't to blame for anything that happened. I would forgive him everything. But he followed his own path. He changed. He became confused. I don't know. VERA What's up, Mum? Got a problem? Why mess with Traviata and Tosca instead of doing things you feel and others relate to? That's not what your audience wants. - I asked what you thought of it. - That's what I'm talking about. Give them what they expect from you. Like asking "Is King Alexander alive?" I'd rather be clamped in a vice again. How did we go? - Where were you? I was worried. - At vespers. - So late? - I was chatting. You're sitting in the dark again. Kosmas's nephew's wedding is Saturday. Aren't you going? Are you eating plain boiled stuff again? I'll bring the boy up, we'll be out late. Are you fasting again? I'll be at an all-night vigil at Our Lady of Kiourka, leave him with your sister. She'll be at the wedding. Boiled barley? Leave him with Our Lady. I won't look after males. Don't leave him with me, I'm a witch. You'll lose them. Mum! Kosmas! Kalliope! The moment will come one day when you will find a way to be reborn right beside him again, beside the man your heart is seeking and time goes by. And time goes by. In that case, don't worry. Let time go by. He put on women's clothes, got married, went to jail. I don't know what he was in for, but I took food to him. So at least he would eat properly. Is this true? Are you really what it says here? - Is that why you're in here? - No, tax evasion. - Supposedly. - Aren't you a real woman? She's genuine. A real woman. I can assure you. God damn you to hell. - What did the priest who married you say? - He was old and couldn't see her. What about your husband? You take my baby. I want you to have my baby. I want you to be its mother. - I don't want it in an orphanage. - Not an orphanage. - It can't go to an orphanage. - Not an orphanage. I want you to have it. You. I don't want my child in an orphanage. You take my baby. You! Can you nurture a child? Raise it and support it? - My husband earns good money. - You're married, sir... madam? Formally? In church, formally, with a priest like you, but old, not like you. We had a best man too. - What about the cabaret? - Caf? theatre. Gone, shut down. All of you shut us down. Besides, my mum lives with us. She'll look after it too. Two women. - But are you a woman? - Well, this is the women's prison. Church and state recognize me. It's documented and formal. Does your husband know what you were? Didn't he suspect? It's strange. I'm curious to see what you're like. Do you feel pleasure? Can you reach orgasm? How did your mum take it? Your sisters? They don't want me to have heirs so they get the house. I'm going to sell up and spend every penny. That's why I want the child. I'm well-off. They can't wait to be rid of me, to see me dead, butchered, so their husbands' cum, spawned in their cunts, is secure. This ex-poof, ex-tranny, now woman, will show them. Show them someone who takes charge of life, chooses his own gender and own name. Mum... I'm going to adopt a child. Out of wedlock. A boy. I even discussed it with the priest. I'm waiting on an answer. Aren't you happy about a grandson? Love your child. Don't slaughter it, like I did mine. Love your child as he is. Don't do what I did. Didn't you want me to have a child? A lifetime, or two, or ten, of burning in hell, is not enough to atone for my sin, and the wrong I did. - I took his life, a life of my doing. - What if I had a child? If he were alive, I wouldn't care what he was like. How would it benefit me? What would I gain? Come to me... to me, if you need to talk. I'm your mother. Come to me if you need to talk. I'm your mother. Come to me. How will your husband react if this child is like you? What would he think? How would he react? If you wanted a family and children, why did you do what you did? Mum, it's me. Open up. Mum... Mum... I was passing by and thought I'd call in. I told you to get rid of these. We've said the dead belong with the dead. Time you buried them, they've rotted. It's time the living were happy. Your dress is lovely, Yorgos dear. - What took you so long? - I was lying down. Were you asleep? The alarm rang for an hour. I set it for vespers. - Vespers? It's eight o'clock. - I'm going to the all-night vigil. Why are you in here with the windows shut? You'll pass out in the heat. Don't button up. Were you asleep? I was splashing water on my face. What's on your face? Is it lipstick? And the smudges on your eyes? Soot from the votive candle. I'm pregnant again, Mum. What happened to the photos? Do you think this one's a boy too? Going out? Mum... Open up, Mum. It's me. My little man. Yes, yes. Shut the door and come inside. Shut the door and get inside. Go and write your... Ismini... Where did our mum go? She left. I told her I would come by today. She went on a trip. Come inside. I told her I would come today. Come in. Go down to Aunt Kalliope and ask her for the holder. - I want to finish... - Later, I need it now. - Can I go... - Later. Phew, I got rid of him. We can have some peace for a while. Would you like a coffee? I make a good one now. I've learnt. Not like the old days. Sit down. The older boy is at English class and Kosmas will be late. Stay and have coffee with me, it would make me very happy. Thank you, I'm in a hurry. I came to tell Mum something. How's work? No. Don't. You mustn't. It's not right. You mustn't It's not right. It suits you. Thank you. Smoke if you want, I don't mind. Kosmas smokes all the time. In February. - Call me whenever you want. - You too. Mum's got the number. Tell her I came by. She's the only one, only through Her grace can I expect anything. Is this your first time here? No, I come every year. Have you got any children? - Two. - Boys? - Girls. - Didn't you have any boys? I have two sons. Both at sea. Seamen. I married them off and so my duty's done. Only I know what I went through to raise them. Over here. My daughter in law. Sit down. Have you pledged any of your children to Our Lady? - The middle one. - Middle one? You said you only had two. - I had another one. - And you lost it? How, you poor dear? Come here, Yorgos. This is Yorgos, my grandson. He's named after my husband, God rest his soul. Sit down, there's room for all of us. Maybe she's seasick. It's your turn. They're calling you. You're next. You'll miss your turn. Go on. I haven't seen him in a long time... because... I can't take it any more. I'm worn out. He was the only one I had. A strapping young lad. But the sea took him from me. The sea took my husband from me and it took my son too. I was widowed twice. May they rest in peace, their souls and their bodies. That's why I come to Our Lady. For her to make my child's body and soul rest in peace. So she can grant him serenity wherever he is. - Who is it? - Can you put your mum on? She's not here, she's gone to bring back the baby. Let go. Let go, I said. Dad took her to the clinic this morning. Who is this? Holy Shroud Maternity Hospital. Who is it? Give it here. Hello? Who is this? You're in a rush for a root so you run me down? Learn to tell what a woman looks like before you get behind the wheel. What can I say? I'm sorry I stopped. I won't open the window, so my taxi won't stink. I've got passengers in here. The place is crawling with these types every night. Please turn at the street after the next and drop me off. And I thought you wouldn't come. Come in, darling. My love story, my great sin... - Hello. - Well, well. - Long time, no see. - We thought you'd rejected us. - Meet the new blood. - It's a pleasure. - How do you do? - At long last he came along. - Look! Here too. - And me. - The arts need support. - We didn't expect you. - We ate. - Cake too. - Many happy returns. - What's that? You shouldn't have. Thanks, babe. Let me fix you a plate. Thanks, but I had a soup. I've got a cold. Runny nose. A whisky, just the thing. The good stuff, in the kitchen. Litsa brought it. She just got off work, she's inside eating. Actually, the rain forced her to stop. And take off that raincoat. A sight for sore eyes. You can't have been that busy. - Done those orders for the islands yet? - Mind I don't soil you. They're on my case, season starts in March. Scull it. - Thanks. - You'll get them in a few days. - Let me get you some food. - She doesn't want any. Take off that beanie too. Well, cheerio. Here's to us and many happy returns. Happy birthday. This is his fourth plate. How's it going? Are we winning? Or will we have the shits again? Antibiotics are keeping me going too. It's been two weeks now. This is the photo you don't remember. You and Litsa. They always got you mixed up from behind, they say. Hello? Stay as you are. Don't get out of the bathtub. I'll get her right away. She had it in a drawer It gave meaning to her life. How romantic, not? I've got so much cleaning to do tomorrow. Look at the hand I had to get up from! Tell me you haven't taken the soap suds off. No, don't. I like the taste of soap. You took too long to call. I got bored in the tub all alone. Three aces in the hand. Yes. My hair? Shaved off, just to please you. Can you feel it prickling your tummy? Go to sleep, my precious star, and I'll be right here by you. Go to sleep and unfurl your sails to head towards your dreams. I never allowed your good fortune to fall asleep, I only chided it never to leave your side. Go to sleep, go to sleep, and take me with you while you sleep.
