REMEMBER THAT? -HI. -HEY. -DID I-- WAS IT GOOD? -THAT WAS GREAT. AWESOME, SO GOOD, MAN. -OH, MY GOD. -WAY TO GO. I JUST WISH YOU WOULD THINK THINGS THROUGH, YOU KNOW? WHICH IS WHY I'M ON THIS FUCKING TOUR TO BEGIN WITH. [EMCEE] MR. PAUL SCOTT. HEY! HOW'S IT GOING? OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HOW YOU GUYS DOING TONIGHT? [CHEERING] IT'S GREAT TO BE IN PENNSYLVANIA. -P TO THE A, RIGHT? -[LAUGHTER] I WAS RUNNING A LITTLE LATE TONIGHT. I HAD TO TAKE A TAXI. IS IT ME OR IS VERY, VERY MURKY JUST HOW MUCH YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TIP THESE CABBIES? I'M PRETTY UNCLEAR, AND AFTER 911, IT'S GOTTEN A LOT TRICKIER FOR WHITE GUYS LIKE ME, BECAUSE MOST CABBIES ARE MIDDLE EASTERN AND I HAVE A LOT OF WHITE GUILT, WHICH ALWAYS CONFUSES THE TIP EQUATION FOR ME. SO, LIKE I'LL PULL UP TO A PLACE AND THE FARE WILL SAY $11.00, AND ALL I HAVE IS A TWENTY AND I'LL TELL THE CABBIE, "YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU CAN KEEP THE TIP. I'M ALSO FLYING OUT OF LA GUARDIA TOMORROW AT 11:30 IN THE MORNING. IS THAT A GOOD TIME TO FLY?" AND TRY AND GET INTEL, BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW IF HE HAS RELATIVES OR SLEEPER CELL AFFILIATIONS. NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE TAKE TAXIS OUT HERE IN THIS PART OF PENNSYLVANIA, HUH? NOT A BIG, UH-- I GUESS THIS IS ALSO NOT A PRIME TARGET FOR TERRORISTS, ALL THE WAY OUT HERE. [MAN] FLIGHT 93 CRASHED RIGHT HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA, ASSHOLE! [AUDIENCE] YEAH! YEAH. HEY. HOW DID YOU FEEL UP THERE? -WAS IT THAT BAD? -WHAT? NO. NO, YOU WERE-- I MEAN, I MEAN, YOU'RE SO CONFIDENT, FIRST OF ALL. YOUR SHIRT'S GREAT. IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE. AND I THINK-- I MEAN, I COULD NEVER DO THAT. UM, THIS NEXT SONG IS-- WELL, IT'S ABOUT A GIRL. LOOK, I APPRECIATE THAT SENTIMENT, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO SELL THIS WELL, I THINK YOU'RE GREAT. SHE'S VERY SPECIAL TO ME. AND WE DID THAT HARD THING OF-- WE BECAME FRIENDS AFTER WE BECAME LOVERS. -CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION? -SURE. -HAVE YOU SEEN A LOT OF STANDUP COMEDY? -WHY? I'M JUST SAYING, IF YOU WERE EXPOSED TO MORE STAND UP ACTS, YOU'D QUICKLY REALIZE THAT WHAT I DID UP THERE WOULD NOT CUT THE MUSTARD. AND I GET THIS PHONE CALL FROM BRETT, AND HE CALLS ME UP, AND HE'S LIKE, "HEY, WOULD YOU MIND IF I TOOK HER OUT ON A DATE?" YOU KNOW, I THINK I KNOW WHAT IT IS, ACTUALLY, BECAUSE I'M A WOMAN, AND LIKE WE DON'T UNDERSTAND COMEDY. WE JUST GET REALLY CONFUSED BY IT, AND I DIDN'T TAKE THAT COLLEGE COURSE ON WHAT'S FUNNY, DAMN IT! ONE THING YOU'D REALIZE VERY QUICKLY IN YOUR STUDIES IS THAT THIS ROOM IS NOT BUILT FOR COMEDY. JOKES DON'T WORK IN THIS ROOM. THAT PANG OF JEALOUSY JUST STARTED TO COME OVER ME, AND I FELT LIKE I NEEDED TO WRITE A SONG ABOUT IT, AND IT'S CALLED, "SHE'S JUST A GIRL THAT I KNEW." [CHEERING] * I CAN RECALL ON THE PHONE YESTERDAY * * YOU TOLD ME YOU MET HER AT A BAR ALONG THE WAY * * YOU SAID THAT SHE LOOKED LIKE A HEAVENLY ANGEL IN JEANS * THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S FANTASTIC. THANK YOU. * YOU SAID THAT SHE SHARED A FEW DRINKS FOR A WHILE * * SHE MUST HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THAT SMILE * * YOU WALKED HER HOME SAFELY * * BUT I THINK I KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS * FULL-ON PENETRATION. THAT'S WHAT THAT MEANS. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] A MUSICAL COMEDY IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ANIMAL. AND THE REALLY FUCKED UP PART WAS THAT I FELT THE BREAK UP WOULD SOMEHOW GIVE ME MORE MATERIAL TO DRAW FROM. YOU KNOW, GIVE ME MORE LIFE EXPERIENCE. LIKE MY SITUATION, MADE ME TOO SOFT AND BLAND AND COMFORTABLE, WHATEVER. YEAH, I'VE BEEN THERE, DONE THAT. SHE DESERVED BETTER. YEAH, THAT'S PROBABLY WHY I WAITED SO LONG. YOU KNOW? I'D WORK ON MY MUSIC AND SOW MY WILD OATS AND JUST GET ALL THAT VOODOO SHIT OUT OF MY SYSTEM. HOW'S THAT WORKING OUT FOR YOU? GOT ANOTHER DECADE OF VOODOO? HEY, NOW, I WANTED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING EARLIER, AND I THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT STEP ON A SORE SPOT, SO I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING, BUT I THINK I MIGHT HAVE FOUND THE PERSON THAT I WANT TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH. BRYN? YOU'RE GONNA SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE -WITH FUCKING BRYN? -NO, NO, NO, NO. I MEAN BRYN'S COOL. YEAH, BUT, NO, NOT BRYN. BECKY. BECKY. WHO'S BECKY? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WHO'S BECKY? -BECKY BELLINGTON. -BECKY BELLINGTON? -YOU REMEMBER-- -BIOLOGY T.A., BECKY BELLINGTON? YES. HOW LONG YOU GUYS BEEN GOING OUT FOR? OH, GOD, I DON'T KNOW. FOR YEARS, REALLY. -FOR YEARS? -YEAH, I MEAN EVERY TIME THAT I'D ROLL THROUGH TOWN WE HAD THESE LIKE CRAZY NIGHTS TOGETHER, AND SOMETIMES ON WEEKENDS. I DON'T KNOW, I JUST NEVER FELT ANYBODY-- FELT THE WAY ABOUT HER AS I DO FEEL ANYBODY ELSE. -BECKY BELLINGTON? -YEAH. -DO YOU HAVE A PHOTO? -YEAH, HERE. -FOR YEARS YOU WERE HANGING OUT. -YEAH, YEAH. I MEAN, LOOK, HERE. THAT ONE. THAT ONE THERE. YOU AND BRYN ARE ALREADY FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK? -YEAH. -WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN? I DON'T KNOW, SHE ADDED ME LIKE YESTERDAY. WOW, SHE LOOKS EXACTLY THE SAME. MM-HMM. SHE'S ENGAGED? YEAH, THAT'S THE NOT SO SWEET PART. SO WHERE DOES SHE LIVE? SHE LIVES IN CHARLESTON. -CHARLESTON? -YEAH. -ISN'T THAT ONE OF OUR LAST STOPS? -MM-HMM. YEAH, YEAH, I THOUGHT IT COULD BE KIND OF LIKE MY LAST HURRAH OF SINGLEDOM. -YOUR LAST HURRAH. -YEAH. SO, IS THIS EVEN A REAL TOUR? WHAT? IS THIS EVEN A REAL TOUR? YEAH, IT'S A REAL TOUR. OKAY, LOOK. I BOOKED ONE GIG IN CHARLESTON TO SEE BECKY. AND I WENT ON MY WEBSITE AND I LOOKED AND I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE OBVIOUS, LIKE ONE LONE SHOW IN HER HOMETOWN, SO I BOOKED A FEW MORE GIGS ALONG THE WAY. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN TO DRIVE, YOU KNOW? WHAT? JUST TO LIKE THROW OFF THE SCENT, YOU PUT ON MORE GIGS TO SMOKESCREEN IT? NO, NO, WELL, AT FIRST, YEAH, BUT THEN I GOT EXCITED ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW? PLAYING SMALLER VENUES TO, LIKE, FEWER PEOPLE, A LITTLE MORE INTIMATE OF AN AUDIENCE. I THOUGHT IT'D BE COOL. WHAT? THAT FACE. OKAY, REMEMBER WHEN WE SAW BRUCE? -WHEN HE DROPPED IN AT THE STONE PONY? -YEAH. OKAY, AND WASN'T THAT THE BEST FUCKING SHOW YOU EVER SAW? -YEAH, IT WAS A GOOD SHOW. -AND WAS HE PLAYING A REAL SHOW? JASON, WHEN YOU PLAY SMALL INTIMATE VENUES WHERE YOU CONNECT WITH THE CROWD, THAT'S ONE THING. THAT'S HIP. OKAY? THAT'S A HAPPENING. PEOPLE SAY "I WAS THERE." WHEN I PLAY THOSE SAME VENUES, IT'S DIFFERENT. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? IT'S A REINFORCEMENT OF A DEAD END. OKAY, BUT IF THIS WERE A REAL TOUR, YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE. THERE WOULD PROBABLY BE SOME INDIE, LIKE, SKINNY JEAN HIP BAND MY LABEL WOULD FORCE DOWN MY THROAT, -SO THAT I COULD APPEAL TO GEN X. -WE ARE GEN X. LOOK, I THINK YOUR SET'S JUST KIND OF-- -CLENCHED. -WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? -"CLENCHED"? -I DON'T KNOW THE CORRECT COMEDY TERM FOR IT, OKAY, BUT IT'S JUST, I DON'T KNOW, A LITTLE TIGHT-ASS? FUCKING THROW AWAY THE JOKE BOOK, MAN. LET GO. OKAY, AND IN MUSIC THE MORE REAL IT IS, THE MORE PERSONAL IT IS, PEOPLE CAN RELATE TO THAT. LOOK, I WANT ALL OF THESE PEOPLE, I WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW-- I WANT THIS GUY HI. OKAY? I WANT HIM TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE. TO KNOW THE PAUL SCOTT THAT I KNOW AND LOVE. AND IF YOU CAN BRING THAT GUY ON STAGE NIGHT AFTER NIGHT AFTER NIGHT, WITH THAT KIND OF CONSISTENCY, FUCK, THE SKY'S THE LIMIT FOR YOU, DUDE. I APPRECIATE YOU SAYING IT. CAN WE HUG IT OUT? COME ON. COME ON, COME ON. BRING IT FOR THE REAL THING. YEAH. DID THEY PUT ME IN COUNTRY? [PAUL] SO IS BRYN COMING DOWN WITH US TO CHARLESTON? [JASON] YEAH, IF SHE'S UP FOR IT. WELL, I'M SURE SHE'S UP FOR IT. I THINK YOU SHOULD TELL HER THOUGH, 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF A BIG DEAL FOR HER. YEAH? I THINK BRYN'S KIND OF A BIG DEAL FOR YOU, HEY, BUDDY? FEAR NOT TONIGHT, I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU TWO ALONE, ALL RIGHT? I'M GONNA MAKE MYSELF SCARCE. I'LL CRASH SOMEWHERE ELSE. NO, THAT'S GONNA MAKE IT AWKWARD. IT WOULD MAKE EVERYONE UNCOMFORTABLE. DUDE, IT'S NOT GONNA MAKE IT AWKWARD. OKAY?

DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GET YOUR SLOPPY SECONDS TO MY WHOLE FUCKING LIFE? DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT IT'S LIKE? DO YOU? EVER SINCE WE WERE FUCKING KIDS, WHENEVER I'D SHOW ANY INTEREST IN A GIRL, YOU WOULD SWEEP IN AND SNATCH HER AWAY -LIKE A VULTURE. -THAT'S BULLSHIT. -IT'S BULLSHIT? -YEAH. YOU LEAVE THAT FUCKING DOOR OPEN BECAUSE YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING. YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING. AND RIGHT NOW WITH BRYN. ALL RIGHT? WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING? I'M SORRY IT'S HARD FOR YOU, JASON. I'M SORRY THAT I MOVE AT A SLOWER PACE THAN YOU. I'M SORRY I CAN'T RUN GAME ON WOMEN THE WAY THAT YOU CAN, OKAY? I LIKE TO GET TO KNOW WOMEN FIRST. I HAVE VULNERABILITY. I'M SORRY THAT FRUSTRATES YOU. I'M SORRY I CAN'T LOCK IT DOWN LIKE YOU CAN. -YOU HAVE VULNERABILITY? -YEAH. THAT'S THE BIGGEST BUNCH OF BULLSHIT I'VE EVER HEARD YOU SAY. YOU GO UP THERE, AND YOU DO SOMETHING FROM A GREEN FUCKING NOTEBOOK BECAUSE YOU CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE. YOU CAN'T BE WHO YOU ARE. YOU'RE DESPERATELY AFRAID. YOU ARE SCARED OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND TO BE YOU. AND IF YOU THINK BRYN WANTS TO BE WITH THAT GUY, GO AHEAD, YOU CAN HAVE BRYN. I CAN HAVE HER. THANK YOU, KING JASON. I DON'T NEED YOUR FUCKING PERMISSION TO SLEEP WITH BRYN. SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU GUYS, BUT JUST FYI, I HAVE ZERO INTEREST IN SLEEPING WITH EITHER OF YOU. THANK YOU, CHARLESTON. STICK AROUND FOR ONE OF THESE TWO ASSHOLES. THAT WAS BRYN MILLER. THAT WAS FUN. -OKAY, WHO LIKES COMEDY? -[MILD APPLAUSE] EVERYBODY DOES. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GIVE A WARM SUIT AND SKIRT WELCOME TO COMEDIAN EXTRAORDINAIRE, PAUL SCOTT! HAVE A GREAT SET. HOW YOU GUYS DOING? [WOMAN] WHOO! MY NAME IS PAUL SCOTT. I'M A FAKE COMEDIAN. I'M CURRENTLY ON A FAKE TOUR WITH THE MAN THAT YOU'RE ALL PATIENTLY WAITING TO SEE TONIGHT, -JASON BLACK. -[CHEERING] I'M A FAKE COMEDIAN, ON A FAKE TOUR THAT JASON SET UP SO THAT HE COULD CONFESS HIS LOVE TO A WOMAN THAT HE SEES ABOUT ONCE A YEAR. OH, AND SHE'S ENGAGED. DID I MENTION THAT? SHE'S ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED. SO, ALL YOU MEN OUT THERE IN THE AUDIENCE, MAKE SURE YOU HOLD YOUR LADIES CLOSE, BECAUSE HE WILL TRY TO LURE THEM AWAY, WITH HIS GUITAR, AND HIS HIPPIE CHARMS, AND HIS DIRTY FEET. NO, YEAH, WE'RE DOING OKAY, THANKS. YOU GUYS WANNA HEAR SOME TRUTH, RIGHT? -HONESTY, RIGHT? -[MEN] YEAH! WELL, HERE'S THE HONEST TRUTH. IT'S NOT ENTIRELY JASON'S FAULT. IF I WAS COMPLETELY HONEST, I'D HAVE TO SAY THAT. SOME MEN ARE BORN WITH IT, AND THE OTHERS, LIKE MOST OF US, LIKE ME, THEY AREN'T BORN WITH IT, AND THINGS ARE A STRUGGLE, AND YOU HAVE TO FIGHT, AND IT'S MESSY, AND THERE'S PAIN. I HAD A FIANCEE AND RECENTLY SHE LEFT ME TO BE WITH A GUY NAMED RON. DJ RON, WHO WEARS A YANKEES HAT. HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THE RULES OF BASEBALL, BUT HE WEARS A YANKEES HAT. THAT'S THE KIND OF GUY SHE'S GONNA MARRY. -DJ RON. -AUDIENCE LAUGHS] WE DIDN'T GET TO A DIVORCE. WE DIDN'T GET THAT FAR. A DIVORCE WOULD HAVE BEEN HONORABLE. A DIVORCE IMPLIES THAT YOU ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING. WE DIDN'T GET THAT FAR. WE HAD A DISENGAGEMENT. WE HAD A PRE-VORCE. DOESN'T SOUND GREAT, DOES IT? PREVORCE. DO YOU THINK FRANK SINATRA BROKE OFF ENGAGEMENTS? NO. THAT GUY GOT DIVORCED. DI-VORCED. BUT IT'S NOT ALL BAD NEWS. THE SILVER LINING IS THAT I GOT 50% OF MY WEDDING DEPOSIT BACK, SO, IN THE FUTURE, IF I EVER WERE TO GET TO THE ALTAR AGAIN, YOU KNOW, MAYBE I COULD FUND HALF A WEDDING. MAYBE DJ ROB COULD COME WITH JUST ONE OF HIS TURNTABLES. JUST HAVE HALF A WEDDING. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S OKAY. THAT'S FINE. THAT'S LIFE. THAT'S PART OF BEING A HUMAN. AND YOU'RE BETTER OFF HEARING IT FROM ME, THAN FROM JASON, BECAUSE JASON HAS NEVER KNOWN A DAY OF STRUGGLE IN HIS LIFE. I LOVE THE GUY. HE'S A GREAT GUY, BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW STRUGGLE. AND THAT'S THE TRUTH. AND THANKS FOR HEARING IT. YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN A GREAT GROUP OF LISTENERS. THIS HAS BEEN AN AMAZING TOUR, AND NOW WITHOUT ANY FURTHER ADO, THE MAN OF THE HOUR, MR. JASON BLACK. [APPLAUSE, CHEERS] * YOU JUST SETTLE BACK, DARLING * * YOU LOOK ALL HUNG DOWN AND RAGGY * * I CAN TELL YOU'VE BEEN WANDERING * * ACROSS THE ROAD * WIND DID BLOW * A LITTLE COLDER * A LITTLE OLDER * AND IT'S WHISPERING 'SLEEP NOW, SOLDIER' * * IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY * AND IT LOOKS LIKE YOU NEED A LITTLE TIME * * WELL, REST YOUR HEAD, NOW * CLOSE YOUR EYES * CAUSE IN THE MORNING THE SUN WILL RISE * * AND YOU WILL REMEMBER * THERE'S NOTHING SHINING LIKE THE DAWN * * SHINING LIKE THE DAWN * SHINING LIKE THE DAWN * SHINING LIKE THE DAWN [CHEERS, APPLAUSE] THANK YOU.

SO, A FEW MONTHS AGO I WENT ON A ROAD TRIP WITH A BUDDY, AND IT WAS AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE. WE'D KNOWN EACH OTHER SINCE WE WERE KIDS. AND HE'S A COMEDIAN. HE'S A VERY FUNNY GUY. BUT HE WAS KIND OF DOWN ON HIS LUCK, KIND OF DOWN ON HIMSELF. THINGS WEREN'T REALLY GOING THAT WELL. -SO, I ASKED HIM-- -HEY, SORRY, THAT TICKET'S FOR THE VIP SECTION. THAT'S ALL THE WAY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BUILDING. OTHER SIDE? OKAY, THANKS. [JASON] AND HE SAID, YEAH. SO WE WENT ON TOUR. AND AFTER A FEW WEEKS, IT WAS A TOTAL BREAKTHROUGH. -[MAN] YEAH! -A BREAKTHROUGH. AND IT WAS TWO FRIENDS, WELL, TWO ARTISTS, REALLY TRAVELLING THROUGH THE FORGOTTEN COASTAL TOWNS OF AMERICA AND TRYING TO MAKE CONNECTIONS WITH PEOPLE IN VERY REAL, VERY DIFFERENT WAYS. AND IT WAS REALLY SPECIAL TO ME. -[MAN] RIGHT ON! -HE REMINDED ME OF WHY I DO THIS, REMINDED ME OF WHEN I FIRST STARTED PLAYING MUSIC, AND THERE WERE NO TOUR BUSES. NO PRESS AGENTS. -NO FANS. -[CHEERING] BUT IT REMINDED ME OF WHAT WAS REAL ABOUT IT WHICH WAS THE DESIRE, THE HOPE, THE HUNGER, AND THE FREEDOM. -[CHEERING] -FREE. ANYWAY, I'D LIKE TO DEDICATE THIS SONG TO MY BUDDY, PAUL. -[CHEERING] -AND HOPE YOU ENJOY IT. * A BOY WAKES UP FROM HIS DREAM * * JUMPS OUT OF BED AND KNOWS THAT HE WILL CONQUER THE WORLD * CHEERS. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] -HI. -HEY. -HOW ARE YOU? -NICE TO SEE YOU. IT'S REALLY NICE TO SEE YOU. -THAT WAS AMAZING. -OH, THANKS. I'M SO PROUD OF YOU. THAT WAS AN AWESOME SHOW. -THANKS.

HOW'S YOUR NEW JOB? -IT'S GOOD. -YEAH? YEAH, IT'S GOOD. I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT I DON'T COMPLETELY DESPISE IT. YOU SHOULD WORD IT LIKE THAT WHEN YOU ASK FOR A PROMOTION. RIGHT, VERBATIM.
