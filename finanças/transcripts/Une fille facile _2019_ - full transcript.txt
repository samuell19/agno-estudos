The beginning of true luxury is to have known the opposite. It goes hand in hand. You must have been poor to make you really rich. On the contrary, to bear poverty, one must know that wealth exists.

You do not see what are you suffocating me? It's your life, it's your choices you only live once. Do you think Sofia is free? It is not like this? Freedom sometimes it also means work. It's a harder job than the one in the office. Can't you see that sometimes She's so tired? And you too, for true. Check it out. I hope so, at least you will have a good vacation. Yes, holidays are a beautiful thing. Already. We don't admit it between us, but we were waiting for a signal of the men on the yacht. Sofia had a rule: Never call first. Two days later they arrived the expected news. HELLO, BONUSES. DINNER TOMORROW IN THE NIGHT WITH FRIENDS, ARE YOU COMING? I was sure that they would contact. You put it here... And you squeeze it like that. That creates the effect cat's eye. You can't do it with your hair tied behind. You have to leave the hair in front. Here you have several loops. This is how I know choose the intensity. Light, medium or very tight. Sophia Loren did that. I would like to change the clock. Did you choose something else? Thank you. Kitchens? We eat in less than an hour. Before a dinner with men one must have eaten. - That's not why we're going there. - Why else? To meet and talk. The most important thing is to be aware from everyone around you. If you make pure gestures and sounds as if you were dying of hungry, you can't. At least make the sauce. - I can't. - Should I? - Can you make the sauce? - Here we go. Wait, I'm going to do one. You're doing it like a chef.

What makes freedom possible in our society? - The money. - Exactly. For anarchists the money is not important. - Yes, it is not one of their values. - So what? It's easier for the wealthy to despise money for the poor. It is right. She understood everything without have to explain it to him. And I've been translating all morning. I feel like an idiot. No, you enjoyed it. And I'm glad if it was. - We are leaving. - Goodbye. Good trip. - Be careful! - Sorry, sorry. - Help me. - It was not my intention. Shut up! Naïma, get up.
