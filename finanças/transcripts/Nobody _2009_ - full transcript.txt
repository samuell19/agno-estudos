You want to hear a really dumb story? Well, I saved up every penny I had, took out huge loans, got two jobs so I could be a starving artist, well, more specifically, so I could go to school and maybe one day be a starving artist. And I was at the finish line. I was about to graduate when I realized the persona I want to be, the person I'm trying to be, I'm not sure anymore if it's the person I'm supposed to be. Up until then, things were going pretty good, you know, partly because I had all these issues, nothing major, just regular life issues, which was cool because, for me, the work was always about dealing with those issues. That's why when this happened, it screwed everything up. Oh, no, no, no, what I mean to say is, maybe we've worked through all of your issues. - Well, no, I mean, that can't be right. - This is an exciting time for you. We turn the page to the beginning of a new chapter, limitless possibilities waiting to unfold, full of discovery-- - I want you to put me back the way you found me. - But we've already worked through all of your issues. Wait, unless you're Jewish. - I'm not. - Lindeman sounds like a Jewish name. - I know, everybody asks. - 'Cause if you were Jewish-- - I'm not Jewish. I'm Dutch, mostly. - Well, congratulations, you're official done with therapy. How does it feel? It felt like everything I ever knew was irrelevant, and I had to start over from scratch. ♪ Took a long trip to try to get it right ♪ ♪ They heard the crickets singing in the trees ♪ ♪ And the slow parade of the whole thing coming down ♪ ♪ City lights were fireflies ♪ ♪ From the hill on the edge of town ♪ ♪ I know that you had to change ♪ ♪ And at the time, I didn't blame you ♪ ♪ I just sort of took it personal ♪ ♪ I think you like the taste of sugarcoated rotten apples ♪ ♪ Think I look funny with that hat on ♪ ♪ People say the strangest things ♪ ♪ In the name of self-defense ♪ ♪ I need your blood in my arms, so I cut off all my limbs ♪ ♪ Right as I was changing, realized I did ♪ ♪ Shut your mouth, you stupid boy ♪ ♪ You just don't understand ♪ ♪ So I went looking for surrender ♪ ♪ Looking for pretenders ♪ ♪ Waiting all the time ♪ ♪ Had so much love that I didn't know what to do ♪ ♪ So I wasted it on petty crime ♪ ♪ If you want to change, then you gotta grow ♪ ♪ If you want to change, then you gotta wait for it ♪ ♪ If you gotta change, then you gotta grow ♪ ♪ If you gotta change, then you gotta do it my way ♪ ♪ People say the strangest things ♪ ♪ In the name of self-defense ♪ ♪ I need your blood in my arms, so I cut off all my limbs ♪ ♪ Right as I was changing, realized I did ♪ ♪ Shut your mouth, you stupid boy ♪ ♪ You just don't understand ♪ ♪ I understand perfectly ♪ - Lindeman, your stone block came today. It's massive. - Ooh, and beautiful. We had them put it in your studio for you. - Great. - What's wrong, Lindeman? - Nothing. - I think Lindeman needs a hug. - I don't need a hug. - He wants a hug. That's Alec and Edie. They think everything is art. So, one day they're collaborating on a holiday theme mosaic, and then next, they're making flowers out of duct tape. - Please, don't. Oh, man, come on. - Hey. - Oh, this is PK. He wanted to hang out at a real art school for the day. - So why'd he come here? - Don't worry about him. Lindeman's always like this. - Actually, I'm not like this anymore. - Is this the new you? - Apparently. - Well, does the new you want to make plaster sculptures with us? - No, he doesn't. - Will the new you consider the possibility that love is the most beautiful art in the world? - And since art is everywhere, then love is everywhere. It's in everything and everyone. They're pretty annoying. - It's not in me. - Now I need a hug. Oh, come here. Hey. I love your sculpture in the student center. What are you gonna do next? - That's the whole problem. I have no idea. I mean, if I were Zach, I'd be trying to take down capitalism one ridiculous performance piece at a time. Or if I were Margaret, I'd be making videos about being 27-year-old divorced lesbian. ♪ You are ♪ What would you do if you were her? - I'd be the most beautiful girl in Minnesota. ♪ Easy girl to kiss ♪ Lelle's a ceramic artist, and everyone said she was nice, but for some reason, I just could never get up the nerve to talk to her. ♪ I say girl ♪ - We wave some, but I've never actually said hi. - You should. - I might. The old me knew what to do. I mean, the old me had a way of doing things, you know, like lunch. Like, everyday, the old me would go to the taco stand. And everyday, the old me would eat that taco. And everyday, after eating that taco, the old me would do what he needed to do. But then, it's like one day, poof, no more taco stand, which means no more tacos, which means no more anything. - I like tacos. - Wait, who are you? - I'm PK. My mom and I moved into the apartment downstairs from Alec and Edie. - How old are you? - Almost 18. I'm supposed to be a senior, but I got held back because we moved around a lot, but I've been working on a couple of pieces of my own and, well, I draw them in this book that I have. Anyway, I was just wondering if maybe sometime you could give me a couple pointers. - Man, right now, I can't even help myself. Holy crap. TX 6? Mind if I call you Tex? That's how they mark rocks at the quarry. So that's how Tex got his name. Tex was my final project. - I'm Lindeman. Call me Lindeman. I guess we're gonna be working together. I had a couple ideas. They kinda suck. - Quarter-life crisis, coming in hot. Fiona's a photographer, which meant that she was even more pretentious than the average art student. - The end of graduate school in sight. What's next? What am I gonna do? Where does little old me fit into this big, crazy world? - Yeah, actually, that's not what's going on. What do you think it is? - I don't know, apparently, I'm not suffering anymore. - Says who? - My shrink. - Ooh, tough break. That was kinda like your whole thing. - I know, right? And now, I have, like, no idea what I'm supposed to do. Just go outside! You'll be depressed again in no time! - I already thought of that! It's no good. - Why not?! - Because now I know I need it, so every time I start to get, like, a little bit excited, I kinda get depressed and end up feeling the same way. - Oh, yeah, I see what you mean. - And the most annoying part is that I can't even afford therapy. I just make him these stupid candlesticks, and he sees me every couple weeks. I never thought we'd work through everything. - Relax, Lindeman. I know it's your final project and everything, but, really, it's just another piece. No, it isn't, not to me. What do you mean? - I don't really want to get into it, but it just, it matters, right, and I have no idea what to do. You just need to shake things up. - What do you mean "shake things up"? - Like, find a new perspective. Like a new way of looking at stuff? - Like a whole new point of view. - I need a new thing. - You need a new thing. And just like that, I had a plan. - Okay, if one were to look-- - Take Celeste, Celeste is into death. - Hmm. Death. Celeste in the fashion program, well, she was pretty much just into death. - So when did you get interested in death? Recently. - Well, tonight, you're gonna be with people who completely understand the intensity of what you're going through. - Is this absolutely necessary? - Hey. You want to know what it's really like if they think you're an outsider? They're either gonna be self-conscious or put on some big act for you, neither of which are real. But if you just blend in, nobody knows you're there, you can see them with their guard down. - And I get all this from eyeliner? We might have to do something about that shirt. - Huh? I'm okay. I got it. I've just never used a cape before. Everyone, this is my friend. Hey, man, what's up? Lindeman. - Nosferatu. - This is Rain and that's Apnea. Hey. - Are we waiting for your cousin? - Dante's gonna be late. We should just get going. - Apnea, would you like to start? - This is called-- So this is what they did, sat around in graveyards and read bad poetry to each other. I've never been so bored slash freaked out in my life. I brought a goat. - Where did you get that thing? - On the internet. - Why'd you bring it here for? - Was gonna sacrifice it. - No. - So we talk about death and listen to music about death and read poetry about death, also which sucks, so when I suggest real, live, actual death, everyone freaks out? - He's right. If we never do anything, then what's the difference between us and a goddamn book club? - I'm in a book club. - Okay, nobody here is afraid of death. - Um-- - Who's going to be the one to walk this creature into the next life? - Think the new guy should do it. - I don't want to kill the goat. Okay, excuse me. There is no life without death. There's no day without night. There's no beginning without an end. Yeah, but that's a real goat. - Lindeman will kill the goat. - Awesome. - Here. Use this. - All right, let's begin. Rain, the music. Nosferatu, the reading. - Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, while I nodded, nearly-- I was gonna run away, but I forgot I was wearing the cape.

Jackson Pollock: filthy misogynist. Piet Mondrian: subjectified women. - What does subjectified mean? - What does it mean to you? - Uh, I don't know. - True. Very true. Hagel's my advisor, which meant this was the guy I was supposed to be going to for advice. Well, thank you, class. Good afternoon. Lindeman, a word, please. Please to tell me why I do not have your artist's statement. Okay, I will remind you. Your artist's statement is your proposal for your Exit Show, which you remember, this show, you need to graduate. - I don't know what to do. - You are blocked? - Yes, I guess. - In German, we have a saying, - I don't think-- - Very good. - Okay, but what am I supposed to do if I can't work? - Very good, Lindeman. Very good. Do you realize the entire Asian race has almost no hair on their bodies? - What's that? - Thank you so much for your lecture today. I really enjoyed it. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Thank you very much, Ms. Ling. I knew she would like it. - Yeah, about that, I don't really get how a guy who basically paints squares can be sexist. - I have no idea. Lecture was verbatim from book on feminism. - So why do you teach it, then? - Chicks dig it.

Just keep walking. Zach's a performance artist who's big on South American revolutionaries and not eating meat. - What's with the cloak and dagger routine? - Just a precaution. You looking or not? Yeah. - You know what's happening in the world? I guess I read the paper. - Well, then I guess you read propaganda! Open your eyes, man. Everyday corporations force-feed you a diet of misinformation and half-truths. You want the truth? - Maybe. - The truth is kids recognize McDonald's and Nike logos before they can read. They see 8,000 murders on television before they finish elementary school. The truth, my friend, they're not broadcasting the truth on the evening news. - So what's on the evening news? - Exactly. I'm not gonna lie to you, it's war out there. War can get pretty intense. When you're in the trenches and the shit starts coming down, all your training goes out the window and all you've got is adrenaline and instinct. - What... What training? - You know why you do it? It's not for the glory or the medals or the parades, although I like parades. - So why do you do it? - You do it for the little people. So when the movement comes knocking on your door, they're gonna ask you a question and they're not gonna ask it twice: Are you with us or against us? - I'm with you. Welcome to the revolution. - Okay, so how is this a revolution? - I got more people coming. Actually, there he is now. Another foot soldier in the fight against global imperialism. Comrade Lindeman, Comrade Rodriguez.

It's the Fruit of the Loom guys. - Actually, this is a protest against the unethical treatment of animals and the morally reprehensible food industry at large. - Boys, go take a picture with the Fruit of the Loom guys. - We're vegetables. Say cheese. Let's wait till the radish comes back, we'll take a picture of the whole group. - Gomez, get back here! - Knock it off, let's go. - Hey, hey, hey. Excuse me. We're gonna have to ask you to leave. - Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you? If we left you in peace to count your money, carry on with your orgy of death and destruction, to dance on the graves of a thousand innocent cows whose only crime was being cows. - Zachary Michael, you know quite well your mother and I don't dance. - Stop hitting me with my own celery! Cut it out! - Can we please just talk about this at home? - Until the suffering ends, we will not leave. Until right is done, we will not leave. Five minutes later, his dad called the cops, and we left. - All right, you fat bitch, now we do it my way. What? Yeah, I called you fat. What are you gonna do about it? That's what I thought. You think you can intimidate everybody 'cause you're two tons of granite? Nuh-uh! No way! Man, it's not like you're marble. It just won't work on me, and I'll tell you why! It's because I am a pimp! And you know what else?! I got a goddamn receipt. You see this? This says I own you, so from now on, what I say goes, son! If I say break dance, you say, what move? If I say, moonwalk, you say, for how far? And if I say head spin, you say, for how long?! Got it?! Good! Now that that's settled, it's time for you to lose a few pounds. I hate you. The happy sombrero was sorta like my Mexican rally cap, but it just wasn't the bottom of the ninth inning yet. - It's so derivative, it's not even derivative anymore. On the surface, it's this new interpretation of some neo-Cubist classical pop somethingness, but underneath, it's basically just this retro-abstract expressionistic realist nothingness, which kinda just gives the whole thing a feeling of surreal pastiche. - That, and it blows. I mean, how is this even art? It's just a big, stupid bowl. - Well, perhaps we take a five-minute break before we next critique Lelle's series of mugs. - I mean, what did I say? - Lelle, why don't you come make meditative Oriental ink paintings with us? - Yeah, they're on rice paper, and really Zen. We've been doing them all night. - Hi. - Okay. Hi. Oh, come on. - Oh, wait, I need help. - Now is a bad time. - Well, what am I supposed to do? - Schedule an appointment during business hours. - It's been two months, and I haven't done anything. - Dammit, Lindeman. I must go. I have private tutoring session with Ling. - Well, goddammit, Hagel. You're supposed to be my adviser. Give me some goddamn advice. In English. - You go to this address, ask for Sumi. Hagel had mentioned Sumi before. She was some kinda Eastern mystic, and spending time with her was supposed to be this deeply religious experience. - What you want? - Um, Professor Hagel said that if-- - Oh, why didn't you say the professor sent you? - No. What would you even do with-- Right. That was horrible. - You got him cheese enchiladas? - What? He's a vegetarian. - So, how's it going? - Worse every day. - Why don't you just relax and put on your lucky hat? - Okay, it's not a lucky hat. It's a happy sombrero. And how could I possibly even think of putting it on at a time like this? - Sorry I asked. - Look, um, I was just kinda wondering-- - No. - You don't even know what-- - You want to try my thing. - How did you know-- - I'm an intellectual. To people like us, people like you are an open book. - I can be people like us. - I really don't think so. - Okay, fine, if you had to put some sort of number on this awesome intellect of yours, what would it be? - Six. - On a scale from one to 10? - On a scale from one to six. - Why would a scale only go to six? - Don't know. - I can do the intellectual thing. As a matter of fact, right now, this very conversation is an intellectual speaking conversation. - I don't think my people would agree. - Why, why, why?! What do I got to do, buy a blazer? Learn the French? What? - All right, if I ask you the first question on the test, and you get it wrong, do you promise to drop the whole subject? - Absolutely. - You are the greatest scientist the world has ever known. What single issue do you dedicate your life to? Hello? - Uh, flying cars! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, moving sidewalks. Ooh, a really nice hat. - World peace. World hunger. Time travel. - Oh, yeah, those are good. Are you working on a time machine? - Lindeman, you don't have to be an intellectual to be an artist. All you have to do is shut the hell up and just make something. It's not like you forgot how. - No, I still know how, I just don't know why. - That's a problem. - I promised myself that when I finish grad school, when I turn in this final project, that I would know then whether to keep at this or to just walk away from the whole thing. - So this is kinda gonna determine the rest of your life. - Pretty much. And I don't have a goddamn clue what to do. - Why the long face? - They don't know how lucky they are. - What do you mean? - I mean, look at Drew. He grew up with racism, bigotry, prejudice. And Shelly, Shelly's from the streets. She's got drugs, guns, poverty. And Lane, Lane's like a suicidal drug addict with a disability. It's like he hit the lottery. He's one lucky guy. - Where are my hardships? Why isn't anybody against me? - Thought you were Jewish. - I'm not. - 'Cause if you were Jewish-- - I'm Dutch. Mostly. - What if I could give you an introduction to a very special group? A group that's been laughed at and marginalized and slandered and even murdered since the beginning of time? - Wait. You're from Canada? - I'm talking about being gay. - Oh. Margaret's a video installation artist who, for some reason, thinks of human sexuality as a sale. - Wait, are you talking about me being gay? - Just think of human sexuality as a scale from completely straight to completely gay. - But I don't want to be gay. - Just try it. - Nuh-uh. - Come on. - Nope. - I dare you. - Sorry. Lindeman, the semester's almost half over, and you have absolutely nothing. So, you don't have to try it for me, and you don't have to try it for you, and you don't even have to try it for your country, but you do have to try it for your work. You owe it to your work. - Would I have to be, like, super gay? I feel ridiculous! - You look fantastic! Bottoms up! You need to relax! - Okay. - You like to party? - Yeah, it's like a party! Oh, hey, this is my... This is my drink. - Looks tasty. You make that shirt yourself? For you. Here you go. Drink that, sailor. Are you ready, boys?! We have a special treat for you tonight!

You think I went too far? - Well-- - You're saying she came to this country with nothing, looking for a bit of compassion perhaps, a touch of kindness and... You're right, what have I given her? Judgment. - That's not what I said-- - Now I must beg forgiveness. - No! Wait! No, please, there's like a month left until the final show and I haven't even done my artist's statement yet. - Lindeman, forget the artist's statement. No time left for words!

You feel that if I reject certain behavioral characteristics, it would result in overwhelming feelings of inadequacy and underachievement, thereby reinvigorating your creativity which thrives in such an environment. - Whatever. If you make me feel bad, then I might be able to work. - Lindeman, that's masochism. - Please. - It's highly unorthodox and most likely unethical, but what the heck. - Oh! Thank you. - Prepare to receive the requested verbal assault. - Let her rip. - At times, I find your commitment to hygiene a bit too sporadic. - What kind of crap is that? - Excuse me? - That's the worst insult I've ever heard! - Well, then never mind. - No, no, no, please, you can't leave me like this. - Then please do not insult me when I'm trying to insult you. - Okay, it won't happen again. - This time, I will not hold back. - Please don't. - Prepare to receive the wrath of Dr. Elmore Weinstein.

Do you have a phone? - No. But I think Margaret does. - You're doing it. You got it. You're in it. It's a good talk, bug. Stay. Stay. Stay. - It hurts, man. It really, really hurts. I know. - But at least I'm starting to figure some stuff out. - What have you figured out? - Well, for starters, Lelle loves me like a sweater. - I'm sorry. - Then it's like I spent all this time trying to find a new thing, but all I really figured out was all these things that, you know, I'm not, all these things that aren't me. - All tucked in. - Thanks. - No problem. - I think I'm ready. - Are you sure? - It's time for my happy sombrero. - Is your sombrero for when you're actually happy, or when you're sad and you want to be happy? - It's for right now. Thanks for doing this, by the way. I know how you feel about the dirt, so... - Actually, I don't mind it so much. Anything else? - Hey, is Margaret... Oh, my god. It's incredible. - It's for you. - Why? - I think you're beautiful. - How many brownies did you have? - I didn't have any. I'm allergic to chocolate. - What, so you're just like this? - Like what? - What's it like to be rich? - What's it like to covered at all times by a thin layer of filth? - Smells fancy. - Smells terrible. - Celeste, wanna make s'mores? Sure. - Do you want chocolate marshmallow or peanut butter? Peanut butter. - Alec couldn't find the spoons. - If you sit near the fire, it gets really gooey. Mm. I love s'mores. - The most miraculous food ever made. - This peanut butter is to die for. - Mm. You have to try this. - Mm. Try mine. Mm. Mm. - I want to try marshmallow and peanut butter at the same time. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Chocolate. And peanut butter. - How was that? - Best one yet. - I wanna try it. ♪ If I broke my jaw for you ♪ ♪ I'd find a bloody tooth and rip it out ♪ ♪ Throw it in the water ♪ ♪ Where it'd flow into the river, let it out ♪ ♪ Out across the flood plain ♪ Oh, my god. ♪ Underneath the sanded silt ♪ ♪ And in between the smooth stones and seaweed ♪ - Hey!

I love him. - Hey. - Hello. - Hey, you finally got a chance to look at my book? - Yeah. It's unbelievable. I barely even noticed the guy, but PK was what we all wanted to be. He was an artist. - You like it? - I think you might be better than all of us here put together. Mm. - That's cool, man. Thanks. - You cheated on me. - It was just a regular threesome and-- - And you liked it. - And I was just minding my own business-- - I can't find the spoons. I can't find the spoons!

It was just something nobody else was using. - Well, at least you're suffering again. You can just go back to that. - And you know what, that's not really doing it for me anymore. - So, you have your old thing back and you have the new thing, and you're not gonna use either? - No. - Wow.

Don't be a fool. Take an extension. You turn it in the summer, or even next year. No, what I mean is, I'm done making art. I'm walking away from the whole thing. - You were the best at this school. - Wow. I don't know what to say. - With any luck, in time, you might even have been very good. But not great. - It is not likely. - So what's the point if I'm never gonna be great? - The point remains the same whether you are good or great. Which is what? - The same. Still the same. - Yeah, but... Listen, none of it feels right anymore. - Then you have made your decision. - I just wanted to say goodbye. - Well, as we say in Germany, - What does it mean? - Just that. Just that. - I need more boxes. - Forget the boxes, Lindeman. The show's in 48 hours. Just turn that in. Paint it white, cut it in half. Christ, just turn it in as-is and call it something French. At least you'll get a degree. - I don't care. I'm done. - What are you gonna do out in the real world? - I'll get a real job. I'll be a beekeeper or a blacksmith-- - Listen! Beekeeper. You have a chance to be a great artist. - Yeah, but do I, really? - Yes. That's the thing about being an artist: everyone has a chance. Man, woman, child, living, dead. Don't you understand? You don't even have to be alive, and you still get two chances at immortality. First, there's a chance you might actually be a genius. - I'm not a genius. - True, that's true, but there's a chance you might be mistaken for a genius. - Yeah, but that's just-- - Plus, you have a chance I never even had. I'm too smart for my own good, you know? I've been all over the world. I mean, I know too many people who've read too many books. It's too late for me. But you have a chance of actually being happy. - Because I'm dumb? - Yes, but here's the beauty of it, you will be so busy working and playing and chasing shiny objects, you won't even know that you're happy. - Okay, but isn't, like, the best part about being happy actually getting to feel happy? - How do you mean? - I mean, I'm not the expert, but it's like if I'm happy and don't get to be happy, then aren't I sort of unhappy? - Actually, that's a good point. - So what am I gonna do now? I have no idea. - Oh, come on, like two seconds ago, I was this happy moron chasing shiny stuff. - That's life in the fast lane. - I was in the fast lane? Goes by like in a blur, doesn't it? - Sure does. - You should've been more careful. - So, basically, I'm nobody, I'm dumb, and I'm never gonna be happy. - Yeah, I'm sorry about that. I'm gonna go get you some more of these boxes. - Thank you. I didn't think it would end like this.

This is like grad school. I'm just a junior in high school. - That's too bad. - Yeah. Guess they had to be really strict about that kinda stuff. - I guess so. - So I was really psyched when they asked if I would teach a few classes here in the fall. - They want you to teach. - Wild, huh? - Yeah, that's, uh... Wow. Oh, but didn't I hear about a gallery? - Oh, yeah, that, dude, a couple places wanna do some shows. - A couple. - Yeah.

That's kinda cool, huh? - You think? - Well, if you're nobody, you're, like, flying under the radar. - Yeah, I guess so. - And if you're nobody, you don't answer to anybody. - No, probably not. - So you're not just anybody. - No? - You're not like everybody. Nope. - And you're not like, "Hey, look at me, I'm somebody." - No way, man. - If you're nobody, like, really nobody, you're like your very own thing. - You really think I'm nobody?
