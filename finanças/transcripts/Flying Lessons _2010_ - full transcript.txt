Know that dad had a gun. He told me that he loved me. And that I was... A good girl. And he told me to go inside. And I said, "no matter what it is, We can just forget about it and start over." No, I don't believe you. You're lying. Then he asked me where you were. Ha. I was at dinner. No, you weren't. I saw you. Whoa! What are you saying? You were always with him. Dad knew. Shut up! I told him that if he was gonna do it that he should do it... 911. Please state your emergency. ...But I wasn't going inside. Thanks. Hmm. 1972 ford ranchero 500.
