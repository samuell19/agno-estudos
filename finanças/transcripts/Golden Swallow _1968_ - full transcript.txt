Golden Swallow! It is Golden Swallow! Pay your respects! Golden Swallow I know you covet fame I've been waiting! You swine! Attack! Golden Whip Han Tao! You know me yet you dare stay? You wish to die, do you? Attack! We don't have a grudge between us... Fan Rui, your behavior is contemptible Golden Swallow stood up to you Yet you used poisoned darts on her Hand me the antidote or I'll kill you Have mercy! Here it is... I dislike killing You and your men will be maimed But none will die If this cannot cure, I'll kill you I wouldn't dare fool you! Congratulations, Swallow! You're recovering fast And you've even improved It's all thanks to you Oh, I've not done much Our styles are different I have little to teach you You're an excellent swordswoman! I've learned from your steadier style But you're much too aggressive You really haven't killed before? Seldom; only when there is no choice When you fought those bandits You wounded all of them They were more or less half-dead You should've ended their agony You remind me of someone He is totally different from you What's the matter, Han Tao? I didn't say something wrong, I hope Han Tao! My big brother! Let me introduce you to... Let me guess He is yourjunior classmate Hu Zhen You called him "Old Three" So he must be classmate no. 3: Flying Fox Hu Zhen Master Hu This is... Let me guess... Xie Ru-yan, Golden Swallow. Ms. Xie Since I came to the Valley Third Brother has visited me every year That's right, we've many classmates But Han Tao is closest to me You've always been mischievous And you a perfect gentleman A fine gentleman you are Befriending a mischievous fella like me Let's change the subject You see, she's really bored No, not at all I just remembered someone They called him Silver Roc Who'd be a perfect match with you A girl? A handsome and skillful young man Well... Don't take me wrong His nickname matches with yours Don't they call you "Golden Swallow"? You'd better say it clearly Silver Roc is always dressed in white His sword and darts are silver in colour He leaps into the air... And swoops down at his enemies No one has ever been able to block his moves Hence he has been given this nickname When he attacks his victims... He looks like a big silver roc Have you met him? I wouldn't be alive if I had He's the best swordsman around But he's absolutely deadly No one could survive a duel with him Not even one I've heard so much of him Then... he must be as notorious as they say! He only kills the villainous men However, I'd say his method is a bit ruthless Silver Roc? Would it be Little Roc? Silver Roc is here! He's here! He's here! Yang Lung is guarding the pass We'll blow him up with fire bombs Good! Get ready, guys! Silver Roc is approaching Let's welcome him When you hear an explosion Attack him no matter what! Now spread out Yes! Isn't that Master Xiao? Yes! Master Xiao is here Go tell Mei-niang Mei-niang, Master Xiao is here Master Xiao, Master Xiao Master Xiao, I missed you Please come in Please come in and have a seat Master Xiao... Master Xiao, it is still early... Come visit us Enjoy the music and wine Isn't that wonderful! That's right Master Xiao! If you still think of her Why don't you go and find her? She will come to me Still awake? Where's "Old Three"? Drunk and asleep You miss Little Roc, don't you? His name is Xiao, he's the youngest He's several months younger than me That's why we all call him Little Roc Though he's the youngest He's respected by us For his martial arts skills He has mastered all the techniques Of our teacher His swooping style is better known as... Roc's "Coup de grace" None of our classmates could master it He's the only one who could You suspect Little Roc is Silver Roc? That's not all Little Roc is an orphan When he was a mere child Bandits killed his whole family He trained hard for revenge But teacher always said that... He's too ruthless It might lead him to serious crimes That's why he's kept in the mountains Teacher hoped he'd change One day he disappeared Then came news The family of his parents' killer Was slain overnight No one has heard of him since When he was still a student Little Roc always seemed aloof He seldom spoke Except to me, now and then The night before he disappeared He took a swallow dart from me Have some more, Master Xiao Come on Come on, cheers Master Xiao After this cup, write a poem for us Let's get things ready Bring the brush and ink Another toast to you! Master Xiao, please Faster Drink fast Alright! Go on, start writing With a sword I travel alone The roc soars high into the clouds The land is vast but where's my home? Oh swallow, where are you nestling? Why do you need so many golden swallow darts for? Told you Golden Swallow will find me Chin Wu was a traitor He should be quartered Bring the two assassins here Yes How dare you two mugs try to murder me! Are you tired of living? Your men killed my whole family So we must take revenge Death don't scare us Really! Carve their hearts out Yes, sir! The Golden Dragon bastards! Today, we failed to avenge But our ghosts will haunt you! Bring Li Wan Li Wan, you disobeyed my orders You released the traitors I've punished the traitor But I freed his family Because they didn't do anything wrong They're innocent I told you to kill his whole family You ignored my orders Guess you too would have to be quartered Ever since I joined Golden Dragon... I've never wished to disobey you But if I have to kill the innocent... Sorry, I couldn't Prepare him for execution Yes! No, I prefer to do it on my own I hope to serve you in my coming life What the devil... How dare you conspire with outsiders? I refused to kill the innocent But I'm not a coward I've never seen him before He's not here to save me I'll prove it to you! Who are you? Silver Roc! Mercy, mercy! Really? Don't trust him Take care of yourself Come earlier next year to stay longer Brother, don't walk me any further It's far enough Very well Oh, come on! We're close like a family See you next year then Next year? Now that you have her, you abandon me? Nonsense We'll be glad to see you anytime Then, I'll certainly come again What if I don't welcome you? You? I couldn't care less Goodbye! Goodbye! I'll drop by anytime of the year He's an interesting character Yes, he is He's quite easy-going Look! He has really come back He's stumbling! Perhaps... Old Three What happened? What's the matter? He has passed out He was ambushed Who could it be? He has been wounded by poisonous sand The Golden Dragon gang perhaps? Hold it We don't even know you Why attack us? She's our enemy I'm Sheng Yong, known as Iron Face! While I was away from home... She set fire and killed my family I'm Double Blade, Lin Wan She killed my younger brother Lin Bai I'm Golden Dragon's Liu Chong She destroyed our branch And killed three of my men I have to avenge for them I'm Fang Lan She killed eight of my students I don't know what you mean! Golden Swallow, every time you kill You leave your Swallow darts behind Now you're denying it? Don't waste time talking to her Golden Swallow, don't laugh so soon Our chief won't let you get away There definitely has to be an impostor behind it all Who could it be? Silver Roc Little Roc? But why... To make you go to him He wants to see me badly Then I must go to him No, you mustn't You have many enemies now If you go now, you'll be trapped Let me investigate for you No, I must do this myself You... you won't be able to help You're afraid I'll find out the truth And kill Silver Roc? No! You're afraid I'm no match for him? It's not that either When he and I studied fencing... Teacher taught us every trick he knew Except "Coup de grace" He said it's too dangerous Executing it wrongly... One could be killed in mid-air Little Roc mastered it secretively I'm afraid either of you will get hurt He has killed so many to lure you out But you... The Golden Dragon gang and the Shengs They've done enough to deserve death Didn't you just kill someone too? I think he is desperate Risking his life just to find me Well, leave it for now! Let's carry "Old Three" home first I must deal with Little Roc myself Please forgive me See you later. Look after yourself You're in grave danger It's better for me to investigate See you later.

Golden Swallow is quite a good fighter I'd love to tackle her myself Spread out and search for her Yes! What are you up to? How dare you break in! Looking for someone? Don't you have a brother? Where's he? He's at the Tien Xiang Teahouse Are you Cao Tien-lung? Yes, can I help you? Murder! I have an old mother to support Please spare me! Forgive him Wouldn't you even consider it for my sake? Wait Have some wine first Excellent! Catch this As you could wield your whip just now I'll accept this wine No wonder you're famous You're handsome and a great swordsman But why so ruthless? I guess that's none of your concern How about Golden Swallow? What's she to you? Just a friend She's also my friend I'll explain it to her myself I don't need to explain to you Since I know who you are And you've identified me Let's put everything clearly As you're Golden Swallow's friend Stop killing in her name You've been absolutely merciless I told you I'll explain only to her Wait! What do you want? Could you be looking for a fight? You parried my blow And I caught a pot and cup you threw Why don't we try something else? I don't want a duel But since you challenged me I'll accept Stop it! It's really you, Little Roc Sister Xie You used to call me Swallow I thought you'd forgotten me You didn't look me up either I didn't think you'll still remember That's why you killed in my name? What I wanted was just to find you Is it worth killing so many people Just to find me? I've never killed innocent folk The Golden Dragon gang, the Shengs They are the roots of all evil That's why I killed them I saw you killed that poor servant He was helpless You don't realize what he had done He has falsely accused... a 14 year old boy of theft Forcing the boy to commit suicide The swine then killed the father And drove the mother mad Wherever you go, you kill Were all your victims so evil? Our family was not villainous But I saw with my very eyes... My whole family slain by bandits I was only nine then They left me with this scar They thought I was dead, so I escaped No so-called heroic knight came to our rescue No one tried to stop them Please say no more No need to recall past events Han Tao Perhaps we should settle it by force Wait! Let me tell you something first I met Golden Dragon gang's chief: Poison Dragon Wang Xiong He has begun to recruit desperadoes Soon they'll all be after me Should you firstjoin forces... Or kill each other first? Don't you worry, Swallow I'll handle those trouble-makers I'll return to fight Han Tao Little Roc! Ru-yan! Try to understand, Tao I can't let him fight the enemy alone Ru-yan! This looks like the killer's weapon Who's that? Silver Roc! Since you know who I am Why not try and get me? Silver Roc We've come to fight Golden Swallow It doesn't concern you I'd advise you to stay out of this Anything that concerns her, concerns me Do as you will! You either want trouble Or you've fallen for her It's a pity though that she has a lover! Stop! These are all either my friends Or my gang members If you must meddle Why don't we deal with it man to man? Little Roc, wait I don't want your help I'll take care of them myself Silver Roc, you've killed our leaders I might've spared you But now it's too late We're foes for life! You're famous for your leaping skills Our "Five Heroes" will confront you! You've slain my "Five Heroes"! This will be your grave Silver Roc, you've killed many men They say you are invincible We say you won't leave here alive You've injured 9 of my 18 guards For that, you must die! Go away, Swallow You helped me and I've saved you We're square I'm off to get Wang Xiong But I'll return for our duel They are too fast to ensue chase We'll never catch them up Let's go back I'm going to bed We had a deal Come to Mountain Yun for our duel Would you go without telling me? I... I understand You had a deal No one considers my feelings Tell me frankly, Ru-yan Do you still love Silver Roc? I... I don't really know If you say you love him I promise to leave I won't keep tomorrow's appointment Also I won't ever again meet you hereafter Tao! What is it? I... um, I don't know Master, master, welcome Are these the best you have? The others are occupied Summon them here Their clients won't permit it It doesn't matter I can take care of it Are you looking for trouble? What if I were! Come quick! There's a fight! What's the matter? Brother Hu? Is it really you? You? You speak first Why aren't you resting in the Valley Why are you here? You all had left, why shouldn't I? What made you come here? I'm looking for someone Who? Han Tao is a gentleman You won't find him here No, I'm after Silver Roc I'm trying to lure him out Silver Roc? You learn fast, don't you? I heard he doesn't have a home He continues to live in these kind of brothels I'm an old patron in these brothels Yet I've never seen him around Why should he tell anyone And publicize his immorality? His last name is Xiao Xiao! Now I remember There used to be a girl named Mei-niang She has a sweetheart called Xiao They say Xiao is very romantic He drives all the girls crazy You'd better try there Good idea! Wait, don't go yet There's so much I need to ask you Sorry, I'm in a hurry Silver Roc and Han Tao will meet... For their duel tomorrow morning Welcome, young master Won't you come in? Come with me This way, please! Please take a seat! With a sword I travel alone The roc soars high into the clouds The land is vast but where's my home? Oh swallow, where are you nestling? Who is Mei-niang? Sorry, she's busy now Is she with Master Xiao? You've guessed it But how did you know? With a sword I travel alone Isn't this his handwriting? He's an old friend, I know his script Where are they now? Follow me Thanks! Please, young master! With a sword I travel alone Master Xiao is a fine poet A young master's here to see you Go to the rear court, Mei-niang How did you find me? I know all about tomorrow's duel Sit down and have a drink Wang Xiong escaped But I've killed all their leaders I don't think he can do much harm Don't worry! We've been apart for so long I've only seen you in male attire Let me see you as a woman like before Can't you forget the duel? Oh swallow, where are you nestling? I know you cherish me... But he's my friend and protector Let's change the subject It has been a long time... Let's get drunk tonight! Is she the famous Golden Swallow? No wonder you forgot I was inside Are you going for a duel? It will be a deadly one, won't it? Master Xiao! Please don't go! You women are all alike! Faster Wait a minute, Wang Xiong! Before you take advantage of the duel You'll have to ask me first! You're "Flying Fox Hu San"? You've only one good hand You bastards trapped me before Now I'll get even with you Step aside, you're in my way I'll let you go since you're injured In that case, I'll use both hands! Man, you're really asking for it! As long as I'm still alive You won't get past me Golden Swallow should've stopped them Now you couldn't take advantage Little Roc! You were lucky last time But you're finished now! Little Roc! Little Roc! Xiao Pang, forgive me It was a mistake You were never my match... After today's encounter I admit you're superior I'm invincible My nickname is Golden Whip But you broke my golden whip There's nothing more to say You're indeed the greatest swordsman Xiao Pang Xiao Pang Little Roc! Stay away, Swallow Little Roc, don't you realize... You're the one I love? Now I'll die in peace, Swallow Go with her, Han Tao Why don't you let me... Master Xiao Ru-yan He doesn't want you to see him die And can't bear to let you see him suffer You know he flaunts a superiority temperament He wants you to forget his failures And remember him as a true hero! Little Roc! You're still obsessed with her But you don't care about me Though I know how much you love me Nothing can alter my feelings for her Will you forgive me? I understand, I don't blame you Seeing me die for her; it must be hard on you Please don't cry. Everyone does die eventually Go immediately! What's wrong? Wang Xiong is here with his men How about you? I'll die anyway I've already caused you much misery No, I won't leave you! They'll be here any moment now You must go I'll fight them to death Let me dress your wound Please go now! I... Come on Master Xiao... Master Xiao... I still reign as the supreme swordsman! Master Xiao! I'm leaving! I'll leave the house for Mei-niang... We'll never meet again... I won't leave the Valley anymore! With a sword I travel alone The roc soars high into the clouds The land is vast but where's my home? Oh swallow, where are you nestling?
