Red Sun! ♪ If I didn't meet you ♪ Where would I be? ♪ How would the days go by? ♪ Would I treasure life? China is the future. And the future is now. Golden Happiness Properties.

Thank you, thank you. My name is Sean Landry and I am honoured to stand in front of you as the new chief architect of this development. I am excited to bring my western perspective... to China. Growing up in rural Minnesota, I dreamed of building homes for people who needed them. But then to come here and have the opportunity to build a city, from the ground up, a skyline for generations to come, well, it... it truly is a dream come true. I look forward to working with Golden Happiness Properties... for the Residencia de Jia! My life is beginning to improve. I believe in myself. I can accomplish anything I set my mind to. I am a happy and successful person. I am growing every day. I am talented. I am important. I will succeed. Hey, it's here! Nice! Please enjoy our signature dish. Cut it already! What can I get for you? Another one? What? Excuse me. So... I'm seeing a new guy. He's so thoughtful. Isn't it pretty? Cartier. The other day, he sends his driver to pick me up. The car was full of flowers. Such a gentleman! Then he takes me to Ultraviolet. The food was gross... but it's so fashion. Only ten people a night. Ten! I've been there. Twice. Maybe you'd like some of his friends? Not like you need any more admirers! Xia Xia! Where have you been? Let me introduce you. This is the guy I was telling you about. Xia Xia! Xia Xia! TEAR DOWN Need another player? What's up? Play that one. Don't keep them. Do you wanna lose? Hands off. Don't jinx me. Let me tell ya, I got myself an amazing new technology. VR! Heard about it? What is VR, like a TV? Country fools! You guys know nothing! If you look up, it looks up! If you look down, it looks down! When you swim, it feels like you're swimming in the sea! You feel like you're flying! Really? Your son sure takes care of you. Another gift from him? He's busy with his new apartment in the city. Renovating two bedrooms keeps him very busy, you know? A few thousand bucks, a piece of cake! I don't need my son for that! You know what? I'm an investor now. What? Investor?! You, an investor? Are you kidding me? You're not dumb enough to fall for those investment scams? Stop bullshitting. They don't stick around long. They pay out till they don't. Anybody there? Fu Da Investment Corporation. Please leave a message. Sorry, the number you have dialled is no longer in service. You're awake. Fortunately, you've sustained only minor injuries. Nothing serious. Lucky I bought you a good car. Here, do you like it? Your mom's travelling with her friends. So, I think... ..there's no need to tell her about what happened, right? Dad has a meeting later. I'll be back when I'm done, all right? And don't worry about the watermelon stand. I'll deal with it. Bye-bye. Hi. - Excuse me... - I told you to leave me alone! - Who the hell are you? - I have your phone. Your friend told me to come here. Why do you have my phone? You forgot it at the restaurant yesterday. Where's my charger? I don't have it. You don't have my charger? I didn't find it yesterday. But it's almost out of battery. Can you go and get me one? Yeah, sure. I'll pay you. No need. What do you want, if not money? To help. That's all. - All right, then, go ahead. - I'll be back soon. Hold on. How about some Xiao Yang's dumplings too? I'm starving. - Yeah, sure. - Wait. What'd you say your name was? - Wang Zhen. - Thanks, Wang Zhen. What's it like, Old Wang? As if they're standing right in front of you! The bullets are flying right at me! Let me try! Shush! Let Granny try first. Come on Granny, give it a go. Can you see it? Granny, be careful. How can you afford such a thing? I bought it! Me! Let me tell you... I'll be right back. Have fun. Old man. What are we supposed to do? Tell me, what are we supposed to do? I was unlucky! Take a cigarette. Maybe they died from cold weather. Don't worry. I'll return your money with interest! I'll return your money! I will! You have two weeks. Okay. How's business? Come on. Have a cigarette. Thanks. I don't smoke. - Have a cigarette. Come on. - No. I don't smoke. Here. I just killed it yesterday. - Fresh meat. - Nope. I promise it's healthy! Totally healthy! Take care. How about this? 500 for the whole pig. Okay? No. It's not about the money. Look how big the pig is! Only 500! Only 500 for a whole pig! You think I want to get locked up? No way. - Not for just 500? - No. - Can I park my bike here? - Fine. Wanna buy this pig? Ma'am, wanna take this pig? Sir, wanna buy this fresh pig? Want this pig? Delivery. - It's you again. - This is for you. Here. I thought you might be hungry. Try it. I'm going to get so fat. - No, you won't. - Am I getting fat? Here. No, no. - Are you sure? - Not at all. You should eat more. - Not bad. - You like it? When can you leave? In a few days. My friends are here. You can leave now. Sure. Enjoy. Wow! Our darling Xia Xia! We are all so horrified to hear about your accident. Keep going Xia Xia! Love yourself! No matter what, we'll always be with you. - Just put them on the floor. - Okay! Hand me the balloons. Thank you. You can go now. Okay! Bye-bye! - Aren't they lovely? - Very sweet. Let's put these flowers somewhere else. Aren't they cute? "I love you." You've got a lot of friends. Yeah, they got me all these gifts. Aren't they pretty? Have you seen Step Up? - No. - Well, you're in for a treat. It's not a big deal. You always say that. Just some bad luck. After I told you not to trust those people! Investment always has risk. Then why are you asking for my help? Come on. It's not much. Just 252,000. - How much? - 252,000. What about your pigs? Sell your pigs. They're gone. They're all dead. Your pigs are all dead? That many pigs, all died? How come? Nobody knows! They all died all of a sudden! I don't know! No-one wants dead pigs! All of them died? Nice going! You can't even keep your pigs alive. Just more bad luck. You know Boss Fu and his ways! And it's a piece of cake for you. Right? Right? Sister... Come on, come on. I'll return the money. Come on. I can't help you. What do you mean? What do you mean? Are you really going through with this? You can't actually win! As long as I'm inside, they can't touch the house. I've asked. It's the law. You want more money? If you sell, both of our troubles would go away. Right? You haven't lived here for decades. Why do you care about this house? I don't care... But just look at this house! It's falling apart! Just sell it! Am I right? You want me to sell my home, for what? To make up for your failures? Who do you think you are? Why would I do that? I'm your brother! I have as much right to this place as you. Why would you do that? I have a right to this place, too! How about your son? He's already done so much. And I haven't?! You have, you have. How much will they give you? A million? No, more than that. - None of your business. - 5 million, at least? It's at least 5 million! It's a great deal! Are you crazy?! Why don't you accept the offer and get that money? You keep this up and they won't give you a dime! Don't be so selfish! I'm selfish? You calling me selfish? I just want to borrow 250,000. You can sell your house for 5 million! Why don't you lend me the money? - Can't you help me? - Call me selfish again. I'll say it again - you're selfish! Right? I just... I know you've done a lot for me. And you've helped me before, but... Get out. - What do you mean? - Get out! Sister, I tell you. Don't take this too far. I'm your brother. I have rights to this house too! - Are you serious? - Bullshit! You pushing me out? Candy Wang! You're just going to leave me to die?! I'm selfish?! Open the door! I just want to borrow some money! Why are you doing this? I'll pay you back! You can sell your house for 5 million! Why don't you lend me 250,000? Open the door! Listen! I'm staying right here until you open the door! I came to you because I have no other choice! Open the door! Just one week after pigs started dying en masse, their bodies are popping up in waterways. More than 1,000 pigs have been discovered so far. Authorities have been alerted. It's so funny. You're just crawling. You have to really swing it. Are you kidding me? Let me try after him. To your side! That's right. Hello? What?! I had no idea! Got it. What's wrong? Was the wife. She said people are asking about those dead pigs. It's a big deal. Quit eating pork for a while. Old Wang! What'd you do with yours? Come on! You're stuck! Can't you see? Give it to me, let me show you. You don't even know you're stuck! Who is this guy? It's my cousin. He's deaf. Can't hear. His family's going through a hard time. So... since we're family, if I can help... I help. That's what family's for, right? So, I told him, "My home is your home." "You can stay here as long as you like." It's the right thing to do. Hi. Hi! Would you mind if I joined you? No! Go ahead. - Thank you. - Yeah. What's your name? Uh, I'm Sean. - Sean? - Sean. - Angie. It's nice to meet you. - Yeah, you too. - What are you doing? - Oh, I'm, uh, I'm an architect, just doing some work. - You're an architect? - Yeah. That's so cool. Yeah! You know, um, we're looking for architects. - Oh, really? - Yeah. Are you a developer, or...? Oh, no, no, no, not really, but we like architects. Oh. And doctors, CEOs, CFOs, sort of, you know, people like that. You fit right in. I guess so. Do you play any instruments? Uh... I played the oboe in middle school. - The oboe? - Yeah. - Cool. - Yeah. - How about dancing, do you dance? - I can dance. Why are you asking me these questions? Well, most of our work is in third or fourth tier cities, so, if you like to travel, it's good. I'm not a model. I appreciate that, but I'm not... I'm an architect for real. No, I know, I know. No, no, it's kinda, it's not really like...regular modelling. - But it pays really well. - Oh. Do you speak Chinese? - No. - Perfect. Bye, Sean. Call me. "We like your face." What are you doing here? I have made myself clear. We're here to discuss an amicable solution that would benefit both you and Golden Happiness Properties. I've told you already, I don't want your money. Miss Wang. Our price is more than fair. You, in your cheap suits... parade around here as if you can buy everything! You must know you'll have to move. We are giving you one last chance to... Is that a threat? For real? What are you doing? Don't touch my baby! - You're a crazy old woman! - What did you say? Miss Wang, let's take this inside. Don't touch me! - What the hell are you doing?! - How much money do you want? That's all you think about! All you know is money, money, money... I know my rights! I was born and raised here! And I'll die here! You can burn this place down and my body will remain here. - Understand? - Miss Wang, please calm down. Why don't we talk soon? Don't come here again! We have nothing to talk about! I'd like to make an announcement. - I'm single again! - You broke up with that country girl? That's right! She was always trying to get me to buy her Louis Vuitton. Just get her one! I did! You think I'm stingy? But it wasn't enough! You got her a fake one! She's never satisfied, you know... Let me tell you, those bags I got her... Are you fucking blind? I'm sorry. Let me get it. Take your paws off me. Your filthy paws. Come here. Do you know what brand this is? No. You don't know? I'll tell you. Gucci. What are you gonna do? Hey, I'm asking you! I'll pay for it. I'll pay for it. Fuck! Fuck off! Don't touch me! All you know is money, money... Listen! You can burn this place down and my body will remain here. Understand? We found this video online. It has gone viral. This woman is a menace to our project. The last thing we want right now is bad publicity. As Confucius says, "We can be slow, but cannot be still." "We can be slow, but cannot be still." ..so, let's take a step back. Well, how much does she, does she want? She seems not to care about the money. Of course she cares about the money. - You have to negotiate. - Yes, we know. But, unfortunately, we cannot release any more funds for the project. You should understand what I mean. Well, there's something we should do, I mean, she's playing hardball. Let me talk to her. Say what? Yeah, I'll talk to her. I'll see what she wants. You mean, you can do that for us? Yeah. Yeah, I can, I can do that. You really are a shining representative of Golden Happiness Properties! You are truly the face of La Residencia de Jia. Clap! I'm just gonna talk to her. This, this, this, I'll take them all! All right. There you are. Here's 100. Keep the change. Try it. It's gross. You've never had one? My mom wouldn't let me. - She said it's too dirty. - It's pretty good. So spicy! Wanna learn? I can teach you. Nah. I'm afraid I'll fall. - Where do you want to go next? - Let's go. Stop eating. Just throw it away. It's fine. Go anywhere. I don't care. Go faster this time! It tastes good! Right? You should come home more often. I've been busy lately. Busy's good! Making money! How's the apartment? It's going okay. Do you have pictures? Show me some. It's not ready yet. I'll take you there as soon as it's renovated. Next time. Nice. - Everything fine with work? - Excuse me. Hippo honey brick toast. Try it. Thanks. Thanks. Enjoy. - Dig in. - It's a waste of money! - It's fine. - I'm not hungry. You don't visit often. I thought you might be hungry. You go ahead. Dad... What's the matter? Son... your pops could... could use a little help. What you send back is not quite enough. You need more money? You know. You understand. Investments are subject to market risks. The bigger the risk, the bigger the reward. It was all risk this time! So... How much? 252... 252,000. How about Auntie? Why would I ask her? Who knows what crazy ideas she's got. She can't help. 250,000! A piece of cake! No big deal. It's okay. I'll figure it out. If I sell a pig, 3,000. For 10, 30,000. And for 100, it's 300,000. See? - In a year, I can pay my debt! - I'll take care of it. I'll get the money. Don't worry. Really? Hurry, okay? Let's eat. No problem. Dig in. Son, don't worry. I'll return it all to you. Plus interest! It's fine. Where's your car? Can you give me a ride to the bus station? I didn't bring my car today. It's impossible to park around here. Send me some photos of the new house, all right? I will. Come home more often when you have time. Okay. Wait, I brought you something. Almost forgot. Dad, I gotta... Here. Here, take them. You're busy. Go ahead. Take care of yourself. I am the CEO of... of Smith and Perkins USA and I am delighted to announce the beginning of a new partnership with Future Malls China! I have worked tirelessly for five long years and I can truly say that the close collaboration between the best Chinese and American talents has proven that once and for all it is... a mall world, after all. Hi! It's Angie. Sorry I had to run out early, but great job today. I've got an even better gig for Friday, though. You'll be an ambassador for China European City. Keep this up and you won't even need your day job. But give me a call back, okay? Talk soon. Bye! Wanna grab a drink? - Nah. - Get a life, man! I'm not good enough! Okay? Dad. Dad. Fuck! Are you okay? - Let me see. - You hit me! Barely a scratch! It's no big deal. You hit me! You fucking idiot! Fine...how much do you want? Money! RMB! This! How much? Say it! 252,000. How much?! 252,000. You're fucking nuts! More than 10,000 dead pigs have been found in the rivers, causing widespread alarm in the region. A special unit is looking into how to dispose of all the carcasses. We will keep you updated on this growing crisis. Mr Wang? Mr Wang, how are you? TV? I'm a reporter for Dragon TV. My name is Zhang Xun. - I didn't do anything wrong! - No, no, that's not what I mean. Just wanted to hear your opinion on a few questions. It won't take much of your time. What questions? I heard that you are a pig farmer? No, no, I'm a vegetable farmer. Then where do you farm? In another village. Far from here. Do you have friends who are pig farmers? Sure. I'd like to know why pigs here have wound up in the river. What? Mr Wang, I just spoke to your town's mayor about this issue. Your valuable opinion would be on TV. My question is why would they dump the pigs in the river, instead of giving them to the relevant departments for proper disposal? Miss, let me tell you... life as a pig farmer is really hard, you have no idea. It's really hard. Go on. You see, in the winter, it's cold and the pigs could freeze. In the summer, the pigs may die from heat. You have to take care of them all the time. 365 days a year. They eat well. Like bagasse, soybean meal, Golden pig feed, Vitamin A, B, C, D, E and everything. I only get to eat soft rice with shredded vegetables. Their life is better than mine! Go take a look. Mr Wang, I know, when we got here, we were really saddened by what we saw. That's why we're trying to find out the reason behind this situation. Don't worry, don't worry. How did the pigs die? Nobody knows. Who knows? All of a sudden, they all died. Who knows why. I really do hope you'll consider our offer. It takes into account the market rate for each one of your champion pigeons, plus a nice premium. Would you like to see them? See what? Come. My birds. Wow. They like you. Have a look. - Uh-huh. - Bai bai. This Mao Mao 1, inside... Mao Mao 2. - They brothers. - Oh, they're brothers. Mao Mao 1 not fast. This... - my best. - Oh, it's your best... Red Sun. Oh, yeah. He looks strong. That's pretty. - Over 2,000 kilometre. - Wow. He will always... find home. That's amazing. - Close. - Yeah. Hey, you know I know this is really difficult for you. But with that...money, you're going to be able to buy a brand-new place with... modern amenities and... This... my family home. I was born here. My brother too. Oh, I'm sorry you feel that way, but... ..but they're gonna...take care of you. I assure you we're gonna build a beautiful community here. We're building homes for people who need them. - I don't want to... - It's okay. It's okay. All right. There. Fly from there. Three seconds, fly home. You know, she said it was her family's house. She mentioned her brother, maybe she's not the only one on the deed. Good idea, Mr Leadry! I will investigate. Ah, well, wait, hold on. All right, buddy. One, two... three! Wow. Do you like it? It's cool, right? I don't get it. You're not supposed to understand it. It's...different. I watch a lot of dance videos. I think, later, I'll join a crew... and win competitions. So, you'll go to America? Maybe. You look like you know what you're doing. Show me some moves? Don't laugh. I won't. - You promise? - Promise. - Come on, let's dance. - No, I'm good. - Come on! - Nope. Come on, do it. I...really don't like to dance. You go ahead. You're a good dancer. Three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Hey. Sean! Sean Landry. - How the fuck... - Holy shit! Phll Johnson, what the fuck? No way. How are you, man? - Wow! - Uh. - Yeah! - How are you? Hey. What are you doing here? Uh, I live here. A year and a half now. No way! Congrats, that's cool! Yeah, how about you, what are you doing here? Oh, I'm just out here with DLR. Yeah, scoping out some new projects. Thinking about opening a satellite office, like OMA and Zaha. - Nice! - You know. - Uh, this is my colleague, Jonathan. - Jonathan. Sean. Nice to meet you. Sean and I did our BR together. - Yeah. - When was that, '07? - Yeah. - Shit. Time flies. It does fly. Yeah, and, well, then you kinda fell off the face of the earth. What happened, I heard uh... didn't get through the AREs, or...? Oh, no, I did. That's false. Okay, yeah, cause there were all these rumours... Well, yeah. Yeah, I've just been here and... and doing, uh, I uh, I did. - I did, yeah. - Good. Good. Well, we should definitely keep in touch, man. - Yeah. - I'm in town for a couple more days, so, I'll look you up on Facebook. - You can't get on Facebook... - Sounds good. - Totally man. - Totally. Well, hey, it's nice to see you end up on your feet. Nice to meet you! This whole street was once full of old houses. This whole area. Now, my house is the only one left. That's why I invited you today. Miss Wang, why don't you consider moving? Move? Why would I move? I was born here. Three generations of my family were all born here! We've known our neighbours for decades. Now, everyone's gone. What will you do next? I will continue to live in my house. I... I'm not afraid! The law is on my side! Mr Wang, we do hope you'd consider it. You have as much right to that house as your sister. She's lived there her whole life. Change can be good! Thank you, Mr Wong, for meeting with us. Thank you, thank you. Goodbye. Can you translate for a quick second? Sure! Look, I understand you don't want to sell your sister out, I get it. She's lovely. I met her a few days ago, and she gave me a pigeon. But this is important, all right? You selling this house is going to benefit a lot of people. We can get back to work! You know, we can get back to work building a community we've been working on for a long, long time. And that's you, you putting people back to work! And also this is a lot of money for you, you know? With this money, you can buy your sister a new place, and still have money left over to do things, things you haven't even dreamed of. Uh, start a new business! You can move to the city! You can start all over again, the world is your oyster! - The world is...oysters. - Just want you to think about it, really hard. Because, chances like this don't come very often in life, if ever. And I can see, sir, my man, that you have something to prove. I can see the fuego in your eyes. And don't let anybody tell you that you're not... good enough... or that you don't matter... or that you're stupid, because you're not. All right? You're not stupid. You're smart. Right? And you are... You are worth it. You are worth every second. We should get going. We hope you'll think about it. Let's keep in touch. - Okay. - Okay? Okay. Okay. Now they're calling it "pork soup." No-one is going to eat pig for a while. The boss is leaving for Hainan. Go find a temp job. You can stay in the dorms. We'll let you know when we're back open. It's been almost two weeks since pigs started dying around the region. More than 13,000 pigs have been found in the rivers with no end in sight. But how did this all start? I spoke with pig farmers to get their perspective. Life as a pig farmer is really hard. You have to take care of them all the time. Their life is better than mine! All of a sudden they all died. This pig farmer, who did not give his name is just one of thousands affected. You can't keep them at home, right? Had to dump them on the streets. No-one would come pick them up. They couldn't pay to dispose of the pigs so they threw them in the river instead. But little did they know... the dumped pigs would eventually rise to the surface. A region-wide containment effort is now underway including retrieving, disinfecting and burying the pigs. Drinking water continues to be tested every day. But the pig farmers have lost the most. We worked so hard! All of a sudden it's all gone! How did the pigs die in the first place? Tune in next week as we investigate. I'm so sorry! I didn't see you! It hurts so much! Wait a minute. Let me call the hospital. - It'll only take a minute. - Don't call them! Don't call the hospital. People like you... Don't you know to look out before you open the door? - I'm so sorry! - It's all your fault. - I'm calling the police! - I'm sorry, I didn't see you. Please don't call the police. Let me help you up. Where are you hurt? It hurts so much. I'm calling the police. Let me see. Where does it hurt? What are you doing? Don't take pictures! I've got a picture of your licence. This is going all over Weibo. Unless you pay me now. Hurry up. - I gotta go to work. - Take it all! - It's gone. - It's much better. - Let's go! - Sure. I'm pretty heavy. Be careful. - Really? - Yes. That was fun. Let's do it again tomorrow. How about it? - Tomorrow? - Yeah. Tomorrow. Sure. Xia Xia. I got something for you. - What is it? - Close your eyes. Just a small thing. What is it? What are you doing? You're the horse sign, right? Yes. Take a look. Don't you like it? Take it back. Thomas finished in the top 30 of Mr Britain 2014! Top 30! Clap!

Oh, no, Mama doesn't dream about you, any more, Wally. - You wouldn't know the old girl now. - Ah, yes, I would, I'd know you any time... Any place, anywhere! Any... Anywhere. Who was that?! Come out if you dare! - Hello. - Can I help you? Yes, taking a look. Bye, have a nice one. - How much per kilo? - 4.8. - Why don't you pick one for me? - All right. You want a big one or a small one? - Doesn't matter. - Doesn't matter? My melons are all delicious. How about this one? Hear that? So... Have you always worked here? No. My husband used to do this. But he can't work any more. 15.8. You can have it for 15, all right? Why can't he work any more? A drunk driver hit him right here. Paralysed him from the waist down. Doctors told me he's lucky to be alive. He's still bedridden. Can't even go to the bathroom without help. 15. That's right. It's only 15. This is too much. It's only 15. I don't need your pity. It's only 15. Thank you. I'm sorry. Take your money and leave. You think you'll feel better by throwing money at me? Will that make my man stand up again? Take your filthy money! Your father has done enough of that. Leave. - Go! - Please... Go, go, go! - Take your money and go! - Please listen to me. Listen to you? What else can you say? Go! Two, three, four... five, six, seven, eight hundred. - Here. - Thank you. You're welcome. Warning, backing up. Can't we talk? What are you doing? There are now 16,000 dead pigs in our rivers... - Belarus. - Belarus! Yes. Well, maybe... Do you feel weird here? - Do you feel kinda like...? - Mm, yes. Yes. Yes, oh... Oh, it feels so good to hear someone say that too! Hi. Sure, yeah, do you want to go to, like, another... - another bar? - Maybe to yours? One thousand. - Okay? - What? No? Yes? - What is it? - My dearest sister. My life's earnings... What are you doing? Are you drunk? You stink! Let me show you something. See? This is all my money. Here, take it. Take it. Why don't you turn on the lights? Trying to save money? I know. They cut off your power. Ruthless. What do you want? They're going after my son tomorrow! Do you know that? You tell me. What should I do? You tell me what I should do! I don't understand you. What's so precious about our old house? Grandma's furniture! Why don't you get rid of it? Why do you always keep this stuff? Why? Oh, here's more! Candy wrappers? Our old candy wrappers? - Why do you keep candy wrappers? - Stop! How much is it per pound? Your silly birds. Stupid memories. Random shit, random shit. I'm speaking from the heart. Sell this house and we're still a family. All right? Listen carefully. Sell this house and we're still a family. Okay? All right? Sell this house and we're still a family. Okay? All right. Fine. You don't need the money. But I do. Hey! What are you doing? Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Hold on! Fuck! What are you doing? I still live here! It has been sold. We can tear down half this building. I'm gonna call the police! They'll arrest all of you! Go ahead, then! Keep working! Boss wants this done today! Stop it!

Tear it down, if you've got the balls! I got you Xiao Yang's dumplings. Careful, it's hot. What a large mouth. What happened to you? I'm not fully recovered. What's your excuse? Viewers, today is a special day. Behind me is Candy Wang, who is fighting to stop the developers of Golden Happiness from taking her home! Miss Wang, you're not helping yourself or anyone else. Please come down! I will not come down until I have justice! Come down now! Don't go any further! No! Not the dog! - Jump! - Don't jump! Getting hit by a car is a solution? Is your head full of shit? You think getting hit by a car is a solution? Are you stupid? I'm not like you. You can help your loved ones. Why didn't you ask me? I didn't think you would care. First, a local woman stands off against developers. Miss Candy Wang... Hey! Mr Landry! Thank goddess you're here! Please... please talk some sense into her! Come on, now. She likes you. Get her down! She's bluffing! Keep going! Are you for real? Now up! Up, up! Stop, assholes! No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop, stop, stop! Stop! Stop! Go back! Go back! Go back!

Hazardous chemicals have been found in a popular feed that killed all the pigs. This feed is manufactured by the Golden Happiness Group. The holding group has many businesses. Its CEO Liu Jun has been placed under police custody. He currently awaits trial. Old Wang, that looks a lot like your VR! Oh, I sold mine. You sold yours? Why? I've had my fun, you see? Those things upgrade very quickly. Today it's 2, tomorrow it's 3. Then 3s and 3s plus. So fast! I only aim for the newest of the new. I'm gonna get something you've never seen before. Clap! Whatever happened to Ms Wong? She's in a modern apartment now. Huh. Actually... I want to talk to you about a new project we have, just north of here. Maybe Paris? Maybe Paris. With an Arc de Triomphe, and Eiffel Tower larger than the one in France. We'd like to offer promotion, to Chief Architectural Vision Officer... Who is it? You should've let me know you're coming.
