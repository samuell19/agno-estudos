Paris, Autumn 1935... Alphonse! Alphonse! Oh I missed you! Quick - I can't wait any more! - So? - They're up there. Second floor, number twenty-nine. I'm going up there! You did a good job! You're not going to do anything foolish. Don't worry, I won't. It'll be fine. I won't need your services anymore. Listen Dumarcay, err.. what do I do about my fee? Mail me your bill, I'll take care of it. Damn it. Maria! Maria! Oh damn! My money... Over and above the money, stocks and bonds and sundry possessions Miss Carnavey bequeathed you her building and shop. I should inform you the house in question is well... a "house of ill repute", you know what I mean? - You mean... - I do! - Really? - Unless you... But I might add, the clientele is quite chic, in fact the best in town and the business... well the business is, after all, is most raunchy. Now, will you please sign here? There you are Monsignor, everything is in order. All that remains to do now is register the will. I shall keep you informed. Err... no thank you. Red tends to remind me of the devil. Come in. How terrible this whole thing is. A real tragedy Mr. Pieron. An outright tragedy. Of course, Mr. Dumarcay had a lover but... let's face it she wasn't the only one. Oh, what with the world as it is today, adultery is we might say, quite a common occurrence. All this would have turned into the usual comedy routine if your friend Dumarcay hadn't been carried away. The consequences are quite terrible three dead people and an orphan. Let's come to the clauses of the will. Since you've been named Silvie's tutor at Dumarcay's request, you're going to have to face certain obligations. You'll have to take care of her rather sizable inheritance. You'll have to provide... er... for the girl's education 'til she comes of age. L hope that you will appreciate that looking after such a large inheritance will request expert advice. Dumarcay was jealous and violent. But, we can't deny that he was an extraordinary financier. - Are you following? - Very well indeed. But I always manage without other's advice. I held onto my money through two wars and some riots. And let's not waste our time. You said you would inquire about an appropriate school where my ward would get an education. But I did inquire Mr. Pieron, I most certainly did. Here, I found exactly what you are looking for. Can she stay there the year-round? - Twelve months out of twelve. - Till she's twenty-one? - I made that the first condition. - How soon can she start? Er... tomorrow if you wish. I sent her to your house. To my house? What for? Nice work! What a family. Oh... Mr. Pieron, respect the dead. Why should I? I'll sign those papers and get out and leave you with your dust and noble feelings. I'm told my young child is here. Yes, she is sir. She is in the guest room? Yes, and she hasn't come out of it yet. - What did she do the whole day? - She cried. She cried? Yes sir. She cried the whole day. God doesn't live in this house. Don't bother calling him. Don't shy back! I don't like it, huh? Now will you stop crying, you stupid idiot! I'm sorry. Just look at her. Eat your food! - I'm not hungry. - In that case, go back to your room! Oh yes, Henriette I want you to prepare her luggage. She'll be leaving for boarding school tomorrow brig ht and early. - To boarding school? - Did I hear you say something? No, but I'd like to ask your permission to take along my parent's photographs. They're in my room. Henriette will give them to you. Come on. But... what are all those pillows for? Are you through looking at those pictures? - No, I, I'd like to... - That will do! And stop being such a prude and asking silly questions. I don't know why you're so mean with me! That will do! Let's go and pack your bags! I say that Lavale is as much an imbecile as the others. I detest politicians. Oh no... I don't give a hoot about dictators. Mussolini, Stalin and Hitler come from the same barrel. Bad apples. They spoil everything. Family, friends, fortune... So what do I prescribe? Pleasure, Dear Boy. Pleasure. You should try it sometime instead of frittering your life away longing for the return of monarchy. I put Miss Silvie to bed. Her bags are packed. That's good. I'm not sleepy. Get undressed. - Hiya Vern. - Hiya Julien. What are you up to? I'm picking up the girl from Paris. A new one from the school. And what about the man who jumped the Paddy Wagon? Hmm. Still running. Good morning sir, are you the man with the young lady for our school? And you're than man who is driving us? - Er yes sir. - Let's go then if you please. How do you do Mr. Pieron? My name is Miss Genevieve Julien, I am the principle. This is Silvie Dumarcay, my young ward. Julian, show her the dormitory. Will you follow me? We will go to my office for the usual formalities. We tend to favour the English methods of education. We pride ourselves on being severe. Young girls often have their heads full of erroneous ideas they're insolent and utterly thoughtless. Negligence on the part of their families. Our aim is to remould characters unfortunately spoiled by wealth. You may believe me, it's the only adequate way of preparing them for life in this society once they reach their maturity. This happens to be my own view. A strict education is a good thing. Discipline is a means to achieve adherence to noble principles. In that case Mr. Pieron, You can be sure that our pupils are treated exactly as you'd like your ward to be. No! Excuse me sir. Oh no, please forgive me! No! No! No... please... please... no... no! Let that be a lesson to you! Class move on. She's wild and unruly. But we'll tame her. Such a bad example. As my notary requested I propose to pay the year's tuition in full and in species. Four thousand Francs. You know that we don't allow prayers? L didn't, but that's all the more to my liking. I don't intent to have my young ward over neither for the summer nor for the holidays. The truth is, my occupation leaves me little leisure. My dear sir, that would have been out of the question. It's one of the rules of our school. No leaves of absence, no holidays all letters and packets you may send will be opened and inspected. It is my duty to have full control. Do most families readily accept to be so separated from their daughters? Our students have rather exceptional relationships with their parents. Yes, and that's why they prefer not seeing them again so soon? I see you're a man of great comprehension. And one who greatly appreciates charm and beauty. We understand each other totally. From this moment on, your ward is subject to the rules of our school. You've got exactly ten minutes to tell her goodbye. I'll leave now, without further ado. Come in! Miss Genevieve, Sophie's in the cubicle. Very well! Please drive Mr. Pieron to the station. Yes Ma'am. Stand up! We don't pray here. - But... - No but! Your pictures will be returned once you leave here. I'll take that, too! Now, undress! Go on, hurry it up! Put this on. Take care of it. It's the school uniform. You're responsible for it. Should you tear it, or stain it, or damage it in any way whatever you shall be punished. Quite severely punished. I promise to take good care of it. If you abide by all the rules, and pay attention, you'll be alright. Do whatever you're asked, and make sure you learn your lessons well. Or... Ladies... this is Silvie Dumarcay. Henceforth, she will be studying with us. Silvie... here are your books. Go back to work. This class isn't over yet. Oh! That's enough! Did you hurt yourself? Claire! No talking during class! Yes ma'am. I'm putting a demerit next to your name. I see you've already got one. You know what will happen if you get a third? Yes ma'am. Fine. Now sit down and get back to work. Come in. That's it ma'am. The gentleman is on the train back to Paris. You took your time getting back here, Julien. Oh, it's because of the cops, ma'am. They set up a road block. A man jumped the paddy wagon. These are really strange times. A man was arrested for getting the country rid of a god damn traitor. Like any French man should. Just think of it. Ten thousand philosophical systems teach how to repress passions. Twenty or thirsty thousand philosophies wit! have you strive to satisfy them. What we see in the theater and in novels is counter-morality with a thin veneer of cosmetic stained almost unabashedly at the satisfaction of passions, bringing them to the fore stimulating them, showing them tricks to achieve their ends. Counter morality is hardly ever analyzed but such an analysis will some day be the subject of a very interesting book which will meet with the moral desire for it to upset their systems of thought. Let's take a look at the list of today's counter moralists who's views... I stopped hearing from my parents. My father was afraid when the National Socialists came into power. But he wanted to stay. He was sure that the government would need his factory and that he'd be okay. ...only one lover at a time... As soon as I saw my godfather I knew he wanted to get rid of me. That's why I'm here. My guess... is that most girls here are in the same boat you are. Her father's a priest. The other one... she ran away with her chauffeur. And you? Me? My father's a big banker. He may also be my grandfather. My mother is also his daughter. I don't get it. I thought you wouldn't get it. Nobody does at first. Silence young ladies! Sylvie! Are you asleep? No. Are you sad? I felt the same way when I first got here. I can't hear you, talk louder. No, I can't. She snores. But the slightest sound wakes her up. Wait. You're a real baby. That's what you are. You didn't know girls could give each other pleasure? Or do it to themselves? What are you talking about? You never made yourself come? Come? What's that? Take a look. You saw how happy she was? No - I don't want to. You mustn't be afraid! Oh, you're so innocent. No-one else here is. Long before we ever got here, most of the girls had done it with girls, or with boys. In fact, that's why some of us are here. You're supposed to use water and soap! You'll be reported. Oh ma'am. I beg you. Please don't report me. Alright. Now go wash up properly. Hurry up! - Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am. - I'm hurrying ma'am. - Do. Young ladies May I present Miss Georgina who just joined the staff of this school. You're all going to obey her. I repeat - you will not disobey ever. Any girl who does will be punished. Sophie! Come here. Report to me later. I'll teach you how to behave in all circumstances. That's a lady's first duty. Now you should all know that. You've been told, haven't you? And straighten up! Head upright! Tuck in your stomach! Now, stick out your chest. What is important is to keep in mind the rank, the position and the sex the age of the person which is in front of you. You shall never show any difference with a domestic, hmm? And, when you have many guests you'll make sure that service is facilitated and impeccable at all times. You must never be careless with your clothes. Your panties aren't very clean. What's more, they're not the sort a nice young girl should wear. I know they're not allowed but please don't tell anyone. - I kept them as a souvenir. - You don't want to be punished? That's right ma'am. When you do something you shouldn't? - It's an honor to be punished. - Yes ma'am. Who said you could lower your skirt? Lift it up! Now raise your right leg. You keep it there 'till I tell you to bring it down! Yes ma'am. And stop crying! I am doing it for your own good! You should never help yourself to too much food. He's a big bore - but rather nice. - Are they mean here? - Some of them are. You'll see, It can get pretty bad. You must be careful girls, alcohol is bad for your skin. Or your reputation for your department. Bring out your chest and raise your head. Get off the floor and do it again! Milk... there's nothing like it to make your skin smooth as silk. It feels just like a peach. Are you positive we're not going to break out in a rash? Don't be silly. Everybody knows that Cleopatra and the other queens out in the orient used to bathe in milk to keep their skin smooth. From the feel of yours it works. You wanna stay pretty? - I do! - Then relax and enjoy it. Wanna jump in? But... what are you doing? - Don't you want me to stay pretty? - Sure I do. Well in that case, pour it. You mind if I stay? She's gonna squeal on us. I don't trust her. Sarah, swear you won't rat. I swear I won't, on my parent's life. If you ever do, you'll get a thrashing. There, pour the milk. Italy. It was teamed today that the Duchy have decided to send fresh troops to Ethiopia. There can be no doubt the Italian leader is planning to annexe the Negasus Kingdom which borders on Italian Somalia. In the Soviet Union, new trials are slated for Trotskyites which tends to prove opposition to Stalin does exist in Russia. Repentant Trotskyites whom Stalin had seemed to have forgiven are once again in for a rough time. In France, strikes broke out anew in requisition steelworks. There's a letter from Blumengr?m Sarah Cline's cousin. He informs us that Mr. and Mrs. Cline have disappeared. Nobody knows where they are, and he fears the worst. Now, the letter says there will be no more tuition sent for Sarah. We'll have to send her away. Genevieve, hold your horses willy nilly. Let's think for a minute. Her parents are very rich. They may yet come back. They may be on the run. Let's take advantage of it. - What if they never come back? - That's something else. She could turn out to be quite useful to us around the school which would more than compensate for the real cost of her upkeep. Let's be realistic. We're taking no risk. You don't have enough money for it. Won't you let me buy it on credit? But where would you put it? In your hair? Or would you put it on your shirt? - Why don't you give it to me? - What's the good of that? Give it to me. I'll let you feel the other one. You'd like that, eh? I caught you. You're a thief! You're hurting me! - What's going on here? - She stole something from me! Is that so? That's not nice. It's not true! Let's see what you've got there. You're right. She's just a little thief. You know medallions aren't allowed. On your knees! You whip her. Harder! Harder, you hear? What did I tell you girl? Harder! Miss Sarah Cline. The principle wants to see you. Now stop blabbering. Sarah, your parents have disappeared. Mr. Blumengr?m informed us. Nobody knows what happened to them. Maybe they're dead. We can no longer keep her here. Poor girl. Where will she go? - Must we? - We are not a charitable institution. Who will pay her tuition? - We can't keep her. - What will happen to her? There is nobody to take care of her. She's only a child in a harsh, cruel world. She'll just have to manage. I don't see why she should be given special treatment. It breaks my heart. Maybe she could stay. Please ma'am. Please let me stay here. Please. I'll do anything. Anything you say. Where did you learn to peel potatoes? You were raised in money, weren't you? In luxury, with a bunch of domestics. I'll teach you to peel. Here! Is that how you peel potatoes? I'll teach you to earn your keep. Up to now you went through life like some butterfly. That's gonna change, particularly with Miss Georgina. She's one tough lady, as you'll soon find out. Go on, keep on peeling. And do it right! Dear diary You're no longer my only friend in this world. I thought I could never love anything or anybody after all that happened to me. And yet, We discovered a marvelous sensation. I let Claire drag me into the shower and I gave her my body. I discovered fantastic pleasure, and overwhelming joy. I love Claire, and I want her more and more. Georgina... it's Genevieve. George... Open up! George, please! George! I want you George. I wanna sleep with you. George, please. Open the door. Let me in, my love. Open up, I love you. Open the door darling. George! That's enough! I want to be alone. The door stays shut. Now go away. And now! There'll be no meat today. No meat tomorrow. - That'll teach 'em! - You're absolutely right. And by the way, they're still stealing our milk! You mean - it goes on? Two more cans disappeared this morning! Sarah, we're going to ask you a question. Please may I... We'll let you stay here with us but you must deserve it. Who steals the milk, and for what reason? Who steals the milk, and what do they do with it? Careful... It hurts. I know who turned us in. Come on. Let's get her. Yes! Get her! Good! Teach her! Don't talk. Your turn, Silvie. I wrote my Godfather and asked him to find another school for me. Maybe Claire could join me there? 1 love her so much. She found a way to sneak mail out of here. Maximilienne, our dry old maiden's teacher, is off for the day. and Claire worked ll out so we could all lake a hot bath. She made a deal with Julienne. He heats the water and pours ft for us and in exchange, he can look at us to his head's content. I haven't seen Julienne around today. He's replacing Maximiliene. Which gives him a chance to indulge in an old act. What do you mean? He's watching the girls take a bath. He likes that. It's harmless. What's more, it's pretty good tactics. It gives me an edge on him. If... I should need it. We've got to be able to trust him fully. I think we can. That's it. Now, kiss me. I never should have asked for your advice. This author is absurd! His subject matter is utterly ridiculous! His hero was a crook. I hate stories about thievery and murder. A lot of people liked it. They must be degenerates if they enjoy such a book. You are disappointed every time you pick up a contemporary author. Then let's find something older and readable. I'm sure you'll find it. Ever since the surrealists, everything is going down the drain and morality with it. We need a strong-fisted man to tell such people where to stop. What we need now is old-fashioned discipline. - Something like in your school? - Quite so, dear lady! It's because we're so strict that our young students learn to apply the basic principles of patriotism, decency and humanity. What your school applies is systematic punishment. That isn't discipline, but cruelty and sheer sadism. What do you know about education? You don't even know your books. And those you would recommend aren't exactly moral. There's also a letter from your ward. Still no news from my tutor. Maybe my letter didn't reach him after all? I'm so unhappy, but fortunately there is Claire. Miss Genevieve wants to see you right away. Don't go. She knows about us. She's going to punish you. How would she have found out? And if she did, what do we care? But it's about something else. I love you. And I'm afraid for us both. Feel how my heart beats. It's beating fast. And your breast is so soft. - Do you want me? - You know I do. I feel just like we're married. Me too. I love you. Your family informs me that you are going to live with your mother. Your mother is going to live in Sweden. You're leaving with her. Someone will be fetching you tomorrow. Ordinarily, we don't permit students to leave in the middle of the year. But your mother was kind enough to compensate for this breach of contract. I hope that when you think of us you'll remember us fondly. I promise I will. I'd like to tell you, you've been a fine student, well liked by everyone. You'll be missed. You come and pick up your things in the morning. I'd like so much to say goodbye. Please, may I? Silvie Dumarcay! Now stop dreaming and get back to work! Will you stand up? Tell us what you know about Stoicism. It's an old doctrine which teaches that honor resides in virtue. It also teaches courage to bear with pain, emotions, unhappiness and misfortune with the appearance of indifference. I've decided to start a gym course. It'll be fun. They're in for a surprise. You'd better be careful. What was that? I said please be careful. Don't overdo it. I'm bored here. I want to have some fun. You'd rather I left. You know you've got to stay here. Not if it bores me. Will you please eat your food! Go on, eat. No, I'm tired of always eating the same thing! I won't eat. - Me neither! I'm tired of eating beans. - I've had it with beans! We're going to run an homage to games played in antiquity. This is a race. A chariot race. Like the Romans. Francoise, Yolande, you'll drive the chariots. Maximilienne... have the chariots brought in. Here they are. Get them set for the race. There. On your marks... May the best Roman win. Let's go! Come on now, run! Come on, go! Giddy-up! Come on, run! Go, go! It's so amusing. So it is. Maximiliene is furious. Julienne enjoys it! Faster! Faster! Faster! Come on! Faster! Faster! Faster! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Catching up, Yolande. Come on! Come on, Francoise! Come on. Yeah! Yeah, yeah! Yeah! Miss Georgina wants to see you. What kind of third degree is she going to come up with this time? I'd rather be horse-whipped. It's because we beefed about the beans. I'm sure. Silvie? She'd have called in all three of us. That figures. She's right. You now. Come on! What'd she do to you? Tell us. Get undressed. Take off that uniform. Your blouse... Your underpants now. Your panties. Now get down on all fours. And now, I want you to crawl around. Now crawl. That's it. Not too fast. Now beg like a nice little dog. Now do it. And now, you're going to crawl slowly towards me. Slowly... Come here, Sarah. Come. Come here. Come here. Since you are a dog, you're going to eat like a dog. Go ahead, or I'll have you whipped by Julien. Oh no no no - not with your hands, no. Like a dog. Now eat Sarah. Like a dog. Go on little Sarah, lap it up. It's beans you know. It's good, isn't it? That's right. Lap it up. Now come, take my hand. Lick it. Yes. Lick my hand. Come on, girls. Make it snappy! Sylvie. Follow me. Sylvie - what a pleasant surprise. Yes, I invited her to have a drink with us. But ma'am... I have some brandy from my orchard. No thank you, I don't feel like it! Come on Silvie. You know very well that it's considered bad manners to refuse an invitation like this. I wanna go! I'm sure our guest will enjoy a bit of brandy! - No, that's enough! - She's not quite ripe. Poor Silvie. Poor Silvie's never had any luck. What a sad story. Her beloved mother turned out to be a bitch in heat. She was a whore. And papa was an imbecile, a coward - a murderer. Now there's her wonderful tutor. A nice man. But an old lecher. Delapidating his Ward's money on a bunch of servants, upon whom he vents his vices. Silvie, you've really had bad luck. So many disappointments. Wouldn't you like to get even? Get even? Would you like to beat them? Do you want to hit them? All those cowards. Cowards who were so mean to you. Hit them. Go on. Beat them. Hit them! Yes! Go ahead. Hit them! Get even with them! Come on! Harder! Go on. Hit them. Hard! Harder! What's the meaning of this? Don't bother her. Silvie. From now on, you'll eat with us. Is that agreed? I'm going to give you the subject of this week's examination. How was Gerald Bonaparte name to the head of the rank of trench army of Italy? And which were the first major battles which he fought? That's it. Get to work. Yolande... Will you bring me that? Will you escort this petty young cheat to the principle? Now girls, back to work. Fine. Silvie Dumarcay. Miss Georgina wants you. Go on! A thought confessed is half repaired. Therefore, nearly forgiven. You were cheating, I know it. I wasn't cheating, I swear. Careful, careful. Don't swear too late - be careful. If you're lying, you're committing perjury. Yolande. Don't lie to me. I will take it as a fib. I wasn't cheating, ma'am. Well now, Silvie. Do you know if Yolande was actually cheating or not? - She was ma'am! - That's not true! She's trying to make trouble for me. That's the truth, ma'am. She's the one that's lying. Now, who's telling the truth? And who's lying? I'm the one who's telling the truth! Here. You're a liar! What else is she hiding from me? Take off her clothes. Completely. Neglect no hiding place. None whatsoever. Whatsoever! And now, let's put this young liar to the question. Here, put this on Silvie. You too, Yolande. I would say that Yolande deserves a good spanking! - Oh no, please ma'am! - Silence! And don't weep or I'll give your points to the other girls. Oh please, no more! Oh please ma'am, please... please! I don't want to be disturbed! Sarah is going to throw herself out of a window! That'll do! Sarah! Sarah! Open that door! Don't be a child. Sarah! Wait a second, let me try. Silly idiot! What's got into her? Can't you do something for goodness sake? She wants to jump out the window! Dammit, she will draw attention to us! - Don't do it! - Sarah, Don't jump! - Don't do it. - Oh Sarah, don't! She's going to jump! - Sarah! - Sarah! Don't! Please! It's the first time I've ever been glad to see a gendarme. - She'll kill herself! Don't! Don't! - What are you doing that for? I can't open the door. It's not budging an inch! God, it's solid. Let's try it together. It's over here. I can't move it. Oh, good morning sir. I'm so glad to see you. One of our pupils is a mite high-strung and I'm not sure about the best way to handle it. The poor girl just found out that her parents were deported. She was desperate. I'm so terribly sorry to have bothered you. We only did our duty. You must have your work out out with all these strikes and street demonstrations. And there's that man you arrested who out loose. You didn't catch him, did you? Don't you worry none. He's nowhere around this part of the country. Don't be afraid. He won't come bothering you. I'm very glad because I wouldn't want to think there was a murderer around. In any event, we're here to protect you. So, you're taking her to Paris? You're just a soft-hearted fool. What's the point of taking unnecessary risks? If she kills herself, we would both be in a pack of trouble. You're probably right. As far as you're concerned, I spoke with the gendarme a while ago. You turned me in? How could you say a thing like that? Even to make fun of me? What did you find out? They gave up on you. They believe you've left the country. It never entered their mind you could be hiding out around here. You know what? That suits me fine. George, please be careful. Swear to me that you'll stay here and wait for me. You know how much I love you, and everything I've done is... for you. To keep you. To save you. Oh please. George, I don't know what I'd do if I were to lose you. If you ever leave, I'll die. Calm down, Jennie. Calm down. I'll wait for you. Swear it! I swear it. Come in! The curator's ready. You'd better hurry, you'll miss your train. Take the suitcase, I'll be right down. Right. You will wait? I promise. We've gotta write our parents! We've got to tell them what's going on! No! The best thing to do is to write City Hall. Let's do it. Right. Let's do it. They're treating us worse than animals. What's the meaning of this? So, you're complaining? Wait till I'm through with you! You're here because your families sent you. And you're being treated like they want you to be. And now now put out the lights! And not another peep out of you. Otherwise... How much We changed. And how my love for Claire belongs to the past. Yet my love seemed infinite. 1 even thought of running away with her. Very far, to a country where we both would have been happy for ever. Now, through no volition of mine, I have been driven to an extraordinary and disturbing unforgettable passion. K used to be submissive. 1 never dared to rebel or even fight back when my cousin slapped me. Fm now discovering that § can make others suffer, and enjoy it. When one of my fellow students does something for which she's going to be punished I'm the one who carries out the punishment. And the fact that t make them suffer gives me nearly as much pleasure as Claire's caresses. On another subject, I noticed something strange when the gendarmes came the other day. The principle warned Georgina who acted as if she were trying to hide from them. Who is Georgina? Curiosity killed the cat. Surprised, aren't you? Before I go I've got to teach you a few things you don't know yet. - Did it hurt? - It was marvelous. I've got to go. No. You can't leave. I'll never let you go. I won't let you leave. You'll never leave me. Are you going to give me orders now? You think you're strong enough to stop me. I know who you are. I know everything. If you leave me, I'll tell the cops. You are dangerous. No - but you belong to me now. Hey... Madame Terlac. Who could have imagined that a school for young girls could be taken over by a bunch of perverse degenerate monsters. Will you pour me some champagne my sweet girl while I think of an answer? While you drink your champagne, may I point out that crime never pays. The police got wind of it and shut it down which proves the law is effective. It seems to me that they closed it down a bit late. It sure took them a while to find out about the goings on. Goings on which the Marquis de Sade wouldn't disown and what was happening right under their nose. Why didn't they step in before? Come on, gentlemen. We're not going to quarrel in the presence of our charming hostess. What shocked me was that morality could be so flaunted. I don't know. I have a daughter. The idea that it could have happened to her is horrifying. It makes me sick. What would you say if I told you they found nun's habits leather harnesses. The girls told me some appalling stories. Yes, it's a real scandal. The world's rotting away. The world's dying. All these blue collars demonstrating in the street for god knows what. Why, they're just a bunch of gangsters. You've all known me for years. I'm not against people having their fun but I pride myself on having an open mind. But when it comes to abusing defenseless young souls I say it's a crime. Were you able to arrest everybody? Unfortunately not. One of the teachers named Georgina managed somehow to escape. The girls say she was a horny terror. They have all the luck. Well our fair city has now recovered its cleanliness and dignity. Palivo... why don't you order a bottle? That one's empty. It's getting a bit late. My wife... Oh Mr. Palivo. Mariette will be down in a minute. She'd be disappointed if you don't wait. Of course she would. Go ahead, let's have another bottle. Mr. Terlac. Let's drink. To our country, and let's finally rid it of its foreigners the depraved and the revolutionaries. Let's drink to the Black Shirt Party. To Colonel de la Rocque. Two months later... I'm no fool. It's all your doing. You're making it all up. I never stole anything. I don't have to. I know what you're up to. You've just got rid of Flora. But somehow I'm gonna fight back. You can't push me around. I'm saying that you're a thief you'd better leave this very minute or I'll call the police! Is that so? Well, if they search your room they'll find the money. You're nothing but a liar! I give the orders around here. Get out! What's all the shouting about? What's going on? You stay out of this, and get out of here! I'm kicking out that whore! But... how can you Silvie? Get back into your cubbyhole. And make it snappy! This is too much! I've worked here for years! I know my rights! May I come in? Help me change! Yes... Yes what? Yes Mistress. On the floor and lick my shoes. Take them off. You can kiss my foot. Yes. That's enough! May I help you remove your dressing gown Mistress? Yes, slave. I didn't give you permission! Forgive me Mistress. Forgive me. That's fine. You're beginning to learn. Dress me for dinner! If you're nice, I'll let you sleep in front of my door tonight. Thank you, Mistress. Now, kiss my boot. By the way, that butler I hired, I want you to take orders from him too. He's starting today. If you love me, you'll accept. Mistress, you know I'll accept anything from you. Anything. You can push me away, but please let me go on serving you. Here he is now. Let him in, and bring him in right to my room. Afterwards, I don't want to see you till dinner time. I'll obey. I'm wild about you! I'll obey, Mistress.
