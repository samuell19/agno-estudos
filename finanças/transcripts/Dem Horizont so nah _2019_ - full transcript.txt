(quiet guitar music) (Girl) In the summer of '99 I was thinking my driving license would be the most exciting. I had no idea how unpredictable life is and how close the greatest pain and greatest happiness can be. (Music ends) I have him! Hello? Hello? Surprise! All the best! (they sing) Good luck and good luck on all your ways Health and happiness Be there too All the best, my sweetie. Come here, come here! All the best. -Thank you very much. -Is it real at all? Blow. (all) blow! Blow! Blow! Blow! (Cheers) Thank you, thank you. (he clears his throat) So. We also have something for you. Yes. -You are welcome. -Here you go. Tada! You are now finally a member in our small fine family empire. Hear hear! (Honking) Beige. Nice. (Happy music) I? Why? I got the place at university in Berlin. -What? -No! How cool is that? -I'm so happy for you. -That will be cool. -Hey 'where are you going? -l'll make you a souvenir. Come on, let's get some cotton candy. (Man) Please. Oh. Thank you. I could have done that on my own. -You are welcome. -Thank you. Actually... Half is mine now. You know what? You can have all of them. (Bell rings) (Announcer) Then let's go. It starts. -Let's go dancing better. -But we love the caterpillar. Nah, you love the caterpillar. -Well. But you're missing out. -Certainly. (Bell rings) Mark, I'm keeping an eye on you. (Announcer) So, new round, new luck. Who wants again, who hasn't yet? A new mad ride. (Bell rings) Are you stalking me now or what? -I think I sat here first. -I would say that now. (Announcer) Are you ready? We start. (Bell rings) New Ri-Ra trip. Off for that. Watch out, it's getting dark. Cuddle round. Oh la la'. (Song: "Hey Little Girl" by lcehouse) (soulful pop music) Finale, baby. (Music takes a back seat) -Well then. -Now get back on. Hey We'll fall into the mousetrap later in case you ... Forget it. (Bell rings) Connect now and be there ... To Jessica! Okay, next, next. Happy Birthday, by the way. (Song: "Sonic Empire" by Members Of Mayday) (fast techno song) (Girls giggle) Is everything alright? Should i drive you home It’s okay. (she chokes) But it doesn't look like it. Come on, I'll drive you. Are you leaving -You still came. -What do you want? - Actually ... - Get in. -How much did you drink? -Mind your own business? -Come on, Jessica, we're going. -I don't think so. What do you even want? I do not even know you. -But she knows me. -I don't care. Fuck off here. I can drive you Now it's getting silly. You can drive into the tree when you are alone. My car is up there. Is that your friend? No. Does he know that too? What if I throw up your car? I'll buy a new one. 30. Where do you live? (Quiet music) Mmh, why does that smell so good? -HaHo? - (girl) Dan ran. Hi. -You live here too? -Yes. Um, are you his ... Flatmate. OK. Well. Yeah, Danny slept with me last night. We sleep with him when he doesn't bring drunk girls home. Well then tell him thank you for me. Good Morning. Did you sleep well? Have a coffee. Then I'll drive you home. (quiet guitar music) Your roommate? -Tina. -Tina. - She doesn't like visitors that much, right? -Visit, yes? That's what you call it. By the way, it was super nice of you to take me with you. Thanks again. You live here? I'm living here. At your parents? At my parents. Um, thanks for driving. Um, maybe we want to swap numbers? You misunderstood something. (quietly) Okay. Yamamoto is a god. If I could work for him. Even if it's just designing your shoelaces. I would be the happiest person in the world! (she sighs) Sometimes I envy you How so? I could not do it. Just go ahead. Without a plan. Without knowing where you will end up. I have a plan. I'm going to be Yamamoto's lace designer. Apart from that. You could do everything else too. Nah, that's you. I belong here. Even if I have no idea what to do without you. Oh, Jessica. You just have to come and see me every now and then. (groans perplexed) I knew I knew him. -Whom? -How cool is that? What? What? Then you now know what's wrong with that. Humid. -All of them. - Definitely not Danny. Either he's gay or he's fucking his roommate. Forget the guy. I've already had that. Mmm. If you think. Woe to you, come back with a coke nose or contract anorexia. I do not do. -I love you. -l do you too. I miss you already. (Song: "Civilian" by Wye Oak) (melancholy lndie rock song) Here are the quiches. -Have fun. -Bye. (Music slowly fades out) (Man) Hey! Hey You, from the picture. OK. They are actually after ... Sorry -How are you? -Well. (Woman) Danny, we need you. See you later. (Photographer) Take another look. Again. Look at him. Fuck. -Let me help you. -It's okay. But then it's faster. Of course only if you let me. Well then. Danny. Other women may be into your games. I don't like that. If you want to get to know me, do it properly and invite me on a date or something. And if not, then fine, then let me do my job. OK. May I invite you on Saturday? You're welcome. OK. OK. (Song: "Heard Somebody Say" by Devendra Banhart) (dreamy mid-tempo pop song) Monsieur Taylor? If you will follow me please. With pleasure. (Music ends) Why do you have an English last name? My father is american. We moved to Germany when I was eight. -America. -Mhm. And how was it then? Wasn't there in ages. But it was nice. We had such a wooden house. A big pool in the garden, always nice weather. I had a paddling pool with daisies on it. Where do your parents live now I don't really like talking about my parents. Would you like something sweet to finish off? -Something sweet? -Yes. We have everything on offer. Ah yes? What for example? Creme brülée, tarte tatin, tart au chocolat, Clafoutis aux cerises. Do you have strawberry ice cream? Uh ... strawberry ice cream. Yes. Strawberry ice cream. That's it. -Yes. -I'd have to ask in the kitchen. What do you do when you are old and ugly and don't make any more money modeling? I'm not worried about that. "And my soul spread its wings wide, flew through the silent lands ... " "As if she was flying home." Eichendorff. We had at school. You're pretty good at it already. -What? -Fat limousine, champagne. -French food. -Mhm. Then you quote romantic poems. Well You said I should do it properly. Okay, maybe it was a little thick. But only because I was just ... a little nervous. -Because of me? -Yes because of you. (incredulously) Yeah, sure. My life is really a disaster. If you're smart, you just run away really fast. But I do not want that. (soft guitar music) -We should do that again soon. -OK. That too. But I actually meant the date. I'm back. And how was it? -How was what? -Nothing to do with you. Good night. Yes. Apparently not you either. (calm, dreamy music) And where are you going? -What do you think of kickboxing? -Kickboxing? Isn't that your thing, yes? How can you let yourself be beaten up voluntarily? Okay, kickboxing. Sounds great. -Jörg is coming too. -A friend of yours? My supervisor. Supervisor? In the youth home. Were you in the home? How was that I don't know what you have in mind but it's not that bad. And Jörg was the best that could have happened to me. (Battle cries) Hey all right? Get them. -Jessica? -Yes. -Jörg. Hello, hi. -Hey. (Referee) fighter in the middle. Come here. Grab it. Is your fight. -I heard a lot from you. -For real? (Referee) Fight! (Trainer) Get it. Get it to you. Take it easy. (Jörg) He's not focused today. But he has never had a girl with him either. -Why 'is he better otherwise? -You have no idea. He could have made a career. What happened? Um, he has ... Stop. Stop. Fight! Stop. In the corners. So you can forget America. The guy is bigger and stronger. -I didn't notice. Then why do you keep your distance? He opens up all the time, with the right hand, with his kicks. -Why don't you go in? -To forget. I’ll forget about myself. I'll throw a towel on your neck. -OK? -Yes. Pay attention. Come on now, Danny. Both fighters in the middle. -Fight! - (Trainer) Kamm, Danny, now. Go in! -Yes. -Yes. Just like that. Go on now. Just like that. Yes! The last kick was really good. (Water running) Danny? Come soon. And? Did you like it? I almost peed in excitement. Then I'll take that as a yes. (quiet guitar sounds) (Song: "Fever To The Form" by Nick Mulvey) (romantic guitar song) (Tina) Danny? -And how was it? -It's worked out. -No. -I have it. Do you want to enlighten me? -Tina's got a job. -Congratulation. Think. Is Tina still sleeping with you? -Did she tell you that? -Mhm. Yes. Mostly. Tina is like a sister to me. Have you ever seen each other If I tell you this, you will have to believe me. Yeah yeah Friends sleeping in one bed together. Tina and I, we've been through a lot together. I am the only one she has and she is my only family. We are responsible for one another. I don't forbid her to sleep in my bed. You have to deal with that. Oh. Yes, you have to get used to it first. Everything OK? -What's happening? -Nothing. I do not believe you. But it is nothing. Sometimes you shouldn't force anything. Better to enjoy it as long as it lasts, huh? What do you mean by that now? Boys like Danny usually don't stay long. You don't know him at all. Yes, that's right. Then invite him over to dinner with us. OK. (quiet guitar music) (Jessica) Not that fast. Not so fast! (they laugh) Oh my god! -I can't hear you, Ducky. -Do you call me Ducky? Sweet is not it? It's an American nickname. - So for me that means duck. -For me too, yes. Danny, watch out! Are you hurt? Oh shit you're bleeding Fuck. -is not bad. -Fuck. Your forehead. Let's take a look. Is everything okay Just a small laceration. -Is it okay? -Yes everything fine. (Danny) Tina? -What happened? -A minor bicycle accident. Can you Tina? Mhm? What about him? Danny doesn't have much experience with boyfriends. Danny. He only needs to snap his finger and the women run after him in droves. But he doesn't snap his finger. Why not? No matter what you look for in him, you will not find it. How do you know what I'm looking for? What is everyone looking for in him? Danny is not the knight on the white horse. Tina, I don't know what I did to you but why don't you let Danny decide whom he chooses as his girlfriend? I just don't want him to be disappointed. From me? Danny and I have seen things someone like you will never understand them. - (Danny) Hello. -Hello. -Thanks for the invitation. Danny. -I'm Rufus. Hello. -Here. -Thank you. I don't drink alcohol myself. I don't know if he can do anything. But the seller told me about it for hours. Was the seller my husband by any chance? No. I do not think so. Bordeaux. Chateau Montpezat. 95s. Bomb vintage. It goes perfectly with my sauce. Now I'm not sure anymore. Maybe it was him after all. Come in. ... was close, ey. I mean, I puked in there. I have ... no, I have ... I got into the wine, into the wine thing ... (silent scene) (calm music) - (Rufus) That was a nice evening. -I thought so too. - (Danny) Ciao. - (Mother) bye. (they giggle) That was a pretty good evening. You have pretty nice parents too. Yes, mostly. -Why can't I touch you? -Because I don't want it. Because of what happened to you? Did Tina say something? At most indicated. Danny. Have you been mistreated? If it is mistreated, it doesn't come close. Who? My father. How old were you? Eleven. And your mother? Did nothing. Maybe she didn't know. He was in my room all night. I screamed. Of course she knew. And how long did it last? -Talk to me. -What's the point? -l want to know. -You do not want to. Top, roof. I just want to understand. What do you want to understand there? Do you want to understand why he tormented me? Why did he play perverted games? When I had to hold on to the bed had to accept everything. Otherwise he would hit me on the back with the belt until everything got bloody because that's what he enjoyed the most. What can you understand there? And where is he now? Where it belongs. Once my mother stood in his way. And when he hit her, I fell out. I almost beat him to death. I should have done that. Instead, I went to the police and reported him. He went to jail and I to the home. Danny ... My life is a catastrophe. I will never have a normal relationship. Yes you will. It doesn't matter how long it takes. We have all the time in The World. Time is exactly what I don't have. How so? Danny? I'm afraid you will run away if I say so. I'm not running away Promised. Don't make promises you can't keep. Now just tell me! I am HIV positive. -What? -My father infected me. -You have AIDS? -No. I am positive. -You are contagious. -I took care of you. -You should have told me that! -I know that myself! You can go, I understand. I'm so sorry. Fuck! (Honking) This is Vanessa's mailbox. Leave me a message. Ducky ... (Song: "To Love Somebody" by Scott Matthew) (sensual love song) Jessica ... Please don't corner me. (Music continues) What is? That must never happen again. That's not how I see it. I will not risk infecting you. Why do you have to break everything now? I have a contagious disease. And I'll die from it. Yes. I have not forgotten. We all die at some point. I've had the virus for almost ten years. I've lived longer than most. But you're not like most of them. Jessica ... I don't expect you to be 100. Just old enough to have a cure. Sooner or later it breaks out. We never have a future. Shit how did you park? What would you think if I moved in here? Forget it. Stupid idea. No. I don't think the idea is that stupid. No? I think it would be nice if you lived with me. Then let's do it. Why wait? -OK. -OK. OK. -No way. -Pack out. You are not moving out. -It was clear that this was coming. -But not now. You just met him. I am grown up and make my own money. -Who will transfer your salary to you? -Do you want to blackmail me? -No, he doesn't want to. -Maybe yes. No, he doesn't want to. But where is that all of a sudden coming from? We love each other. Where is the problem? Well, that you hardly know each other, maybe? Moving in with someone is a huge thing. You have all the time in the world. We just don't. What does this mean? What does that mean? Hey ... Jessica. Oh come on, damn it, talk to us now. He's HIV positive, okay. HIV? Do you mean aids? No, I mean HIV positive. That's a difference. Please tell me you didn't sleep with him. Are you crazy? -Where did he get that from? -He doesn't do drugs. -No more. -You have no idea. I don't give a shit where he got it from. You won't move in with him. -You can't stop me. -Oh but. Damn. Shit mom, open the door! We locked our 18 year old daughter in her room. I know. I mean... we can't leave them in there for long. I know. (Danny) Well, the entire left half of the closet is free. And I've made some space for you here. If that's not enough, we can add another shelf here, or I ask Tina if she's looking for ... What? -You're cute when you're nervous. -Is it so obvious, yes? -I know how you can help me. -Oh yes? (Tina) Danny, I'm going to work. Should i bring something? I have to get something for Jessica anyway. Think. Am I interrupting? Um, I just wanted to say that ... I moved in here and didn't even ask if that's okay with you. -Let Danny's apartment. -Yes. Nevertheless. Don't be afraid, I won't take Danny away from you. That's what you say now. What if you soon see it differently and force him to make up his mind? First, Danny won't let himself be forced into anything. Second, he would always choose you anyway. Maybe that was the case. I've never seen Danny like this before. He's the only one I still have. That won't change either. (Door opens) I was at a counseling center. Just ask me out. I know everything now. The most important thing: we can sleep together. When the condom breaks medication can prevent infection. Hey If that's enough for me, it must be enough for you too. Unless you don't want to have sex with me anymore. I see. Do you mean now or what? Ducky. Wake up. You can't hide here forever. Sooner or later you have to go to work. You should see how you can get along without me. Don't be so hard. How so? They're tough on you too. Yes, because they are worried. It's not a crime, is it? I do. Until tomorrow. -Oh 'Jessica? -Yes? Vanessa tried to reach you. Yes I know. I'll meet her later. -Hey. -What? Nothing. See you tomorrow. (joyfully) Oh! -Nice! -Hhow long are you staying? Just the weekend. There's a lot to talk about. Let's have a drink. Do I have something? (driving techno beat) I'm doing an internship in Tokyo. One of Yamamoto's students. -The hammer. -Yes. Then you're practically his student. Marriages! Oh, I'm so happy for you. But? Your mother is worried about you. -If you ask me, rightly so. -l don't ask you. You should have shut up. -Would you like to keep this a secret? -Yes. Because you're embarrassed. -No. Because it doesn't matter. -The guy is dangerous. -You know nothing. -l want to help. I do not need that. I know what I am doing! No, otherwise you wouldn't go to bed with an AIDS patient! -Is what happened to you? -Let's go home. Clear. There is the fagot. Fuck off your aids contaminated ass. We were just about to go. Hop in. You have to choose. Should i go or stay -Little fagot. -Jakob, leave him alone. I'm not the one to go after you with three guys. Stop that shit! Jakob, stop! -Polish him in the face. -Stop it! Spasti. (Jessica screams) (Friend) Take care of the blood. (sad music) JessL What are you doing here? Everything okay? Yes. We'll be fine, thank you. Should i take you to the hospital -Thank you, it's okay. -Can I drive you home? We're at Danny's home. I mean that. Well, I wouldn't mind. OK. I stand over there. (Song: "By This River" by Kovacs) (depressed piano song with melancholy singing) (Music slowly fades out) I'll get something to cool off. That should not have happened. I actually never lose control. That only happened to me once. When you beat up your father? No That was on purpose. I am talking about us. Is it that bad? I'll be careful. (soft music) N / A? How's it going? -Get out! -Let yourself be surprised. Did Danny tell you where we met? No not true. That was in a self-help group. We experienced almost the same thing with our fathers. -You don't have to tell me. -But. I want you to know Danny was a little smarter than me. He stayed afloat with kickboxing, I with heroin. At 14 I left home and ended up on the line. The youth welfare office put me in the self-help group. And there was Danny. He chased me into drug rehab. Even let me move in with you. He reported my father and helped me sue him. (clears his throat) The wanker only got six years. At night I wake up in a panic that he might come back. That's why I sleep with Danny so often. It's not that bad at all. - Would you like anything else? -Yes gladly. Thank you. Good French. -I chose well. -To you of you. -Cheers. -To you of you. (Giggle) (they hum "Happy Birthday") Here she comes. Blow out and what to wish. 21st What's this? This is just the confirmation of participation in the championship. I'm gonna work your ass off like that for the next few months -Really. -You're going to Atlanta. I'm going to the States? -Come here. -Thank you. With pleasure. Well, I have a little too ... -Is difficult. -OK. Fight! Just like that. Go on now. Fight! Nice. Strong, Danny. Will you give me my wallet In the jacket pocket. Inside. In the inside pocket. Why is there my name on it? What? No idea. It's only in six months, but maybe you want to come with me. I'll show you where I grew up. (quiet piano music) (Message tone) (Music continues) (Creak) (Tina) Danny? It's just me. Danny's shoot takes a little longer. OK. Tina. Comb. (quiet piano music continues) (rapid knock) Slide over. What's happening? Danny! What happened? Tina's age comes out earlier. Because of good leadership. Fuck! Where is she? (loud) Where's Tina? Above. You stay here. I didn't give her anything. (Danny) Tina! Tina. Tina! - (man) Hey. - (Danny) Tina? (calm, depressed music) (depressed music continues) (silent scene) I should have taken care of her. -It's not your fault. -You don't know how it is. Always fight! Every shitty day. -Crap! -Danny, stop it. -Sch. - (Danny sobs) All good. (melancholy piano music) (Music continues) (melancholy piano music continues) Danny. I'll fall asleep right away. -What is it, huh? -What? -What? -You can be in a bad mood. It's been like this all week. Continue. Do you have your days or what? Ah! Go then. Keep going. Now for a few kicks. Kick. And another one. (Door opens) -I hope you are hungry? -l have to go to training. Would it kill you to go there an hour later? You have hardly eaten for months. Train like a madman. It's not long before the competition. We both know that's not the only reason. That's my way of dealing with it. Maybe it's the wrong way. I want to help you. But I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know if you want me here either. Of course I do. But not that you make me your business. What do you mean by that? No idea. Go to work. Meet friends. -Live your life. -l live my life. -When did you see friends? -l don't feel like doing it. I will soon be gone. You have your whole life ahead of you. Great. And what should that look like? I work with my parents, marry some guy. And then do I build myself a house and have children? Yes! That's more than most have. If not, it's okay too, but do something. Anything. -On the hip, Danny. -Already clear. -The strength comes from the body. -I'm not a beginner. Now just full bottle. Comb! One two three four. One two three four. One two three four. So. -What is? -Nothing. -When was the last time you went to the doctor? -I'm good. -Let's move on? -You are out of shape. - Is that how you want to go to championship? -What does this mean? That I don't train you like that. OK. I don't need you at all I do it alone. Have fun. (Rattle) Have you had this before? It's just the training stress. -Let me examine you. -I'm fine, Ducky. I do. (he hums "Happy Birthday") Good Morning. (seriously) What is that? Happy Birthday. We said we wouldn't make a thing of it. Well. If you do not want. No. I didn't mean it like that. (Danny) I'm sorry I went underground. I forgot it wasn't easy for you either. When do you have to go to training? I'll skip that today. (Song: "! Want To Know What Love Is" by Foreigner) (soulful love song) (silent scene) -Two tickets? -No. All. (Music continues) (soulful music continues) (Music continues in the car radio) (Radio reception is noisy) (she turns off the radio) Danny? Danny! Fuck! Shit man Danny, wake up. What about you? (Tires squeal) (gasps) Fuck. Fuck. Danny? Do you hear me? Danny, awake ... (Beeping) (high-pitched metallic roar) (Doctor) The pictures were difficult to read but we are sure it is a PML. -An AIDS-defining disease. -What does that mean? There will be other symptoms in addition to the muscle twitching. What kind of symptoms? There are two types: one has language deficits, Memory loss, blindness. The other can suffer from paralysis, motor failures, strokes, dementia. As different as the two variants are, they often end the same way. -How long after? -Now wait ... Surely you can treat that somehow. HAART therapy can keep your T lymphocyte count stable, but the therapy can only slow the course of the disease. How long after? Three to 15 months. Now rest first. We'll see tomorrow. (Doctor) We should give Mr. Taylor some rest. And you can come back tomorrow. (anxious music) I'll just go ... you don't have to wait for me. (quiet piano music) Ducky. I'm really lucky, am I? I take everything with me. You are young and strong. And more stubborn than anyone I know. Maybe ... you have more time. And what would that look like? Blind. Paralyzed. A complete care case. I would say yes, let's get into a coma. But you idiot don't even drink. It would be a good time to start now. (quiet piano music) (Knock) (door opens) Morning. How are you? I'm so sorry. Now it was all in vain. Fuck the fight. What are you going to do now? She'll manage it. What matters now is what you want. (Squeaks and rumble) What do you do? We're flying to the States as planned. To the competition? How do you imagine that? No, I don't mean for fighting. -Let's just drive across the country. -But... You're welcome. But when we get back you do therapy. Or? Danny? Yes. Mom did you see my red bikini What? Watch out. You can still stay here, okay? I don't want to. You don't have to worry. I'm good. You always say I do !! be happy. Even if you imagined it differently, i am happy in spite of everything. Then I'll get the big bag for you from the basement, okay? I am proud of you. (solid guitar music) Think. (Music continues) -Can you promise me something? -What? Can we pretend for the next two weeks as if we were a normal couple? Hey girl Uachend) Yes “. You have to drive yourself. Yes. Let's go. (Song: "Ohio" by Damien Jurado) (melancholy country music) (melancholy country music continues) (Music continues) (Cheers) (Music ends) As a child, I was always on the beach. Everything was fine then. (soft piano music) (Music ends) (Sound of the sea) (Rustle) (ominous music) (low sobs) Danny? Danny. Danny, calm down. Danny, all good. I'm here. -To breathe. - (he breathes hectically) On off. Breathe in. Exhale. To breathe. Okay come on Up with you, come (he breathes hectically) Danny, look at me. All is well. (quiet piano music begins) (Music continues) (Music ends) (he gasps) I have saved up a lot and will open an account in your name. -My furniture is worth a lot. -Danny, stop. What shoud that? Ducky, I can't go back to the hospital. I can't change that I'm going to die. But when and how, I decide. No. No. I went with you every step And now you wanna tell me that you ain't every fucking day that you still have, want to spend with me. -What choice do I have? -Stay with me. -Ducky. -Fuck your "Ducky"! (Song: "You Again" by Kovacs) (melancholy guitar song) (Music continues) (Song ends) Where do you want to go To Danny. -Middle of the night? -l have to. If you go, I'll go too. -Do you still have them all? -Without you my life is over. I don't wanna hear that shit. -Open the door! -Go! -Open the door! -Get lost! -I'm kicking in the door. -You can try that. (she sobs) I can't do this without you. Of course you can. You are the strongest person I know. Listen to me. Life gave me so much shit. But it made up a lot with you. And now I want you to move on. And that you will be happy. You shouldn't tell me what to do. And now open the fucking door. (Danny) I'm so sorry. What? I would have loved to stay with you longer. Maybe we would have emigrated to a lonely island. Just us and the children. Soft children? Well ours. The four. Or five. Two at most. We would have talked about that too. They would have been pretty cool. Ducky if you really want me to then I'll do the therapy. That’s why I’m not asking you to. (Danny) Do you see back there? Where heaven and earth meet. In Eichendorff's poem, it says when the line between heaven and earth dissolves, you can jump back and forth between the vastness. The dead can visit the living and vice versa. When you see heaven and earth touch then imagine I was waiting for you there. (sad guitar music) (Danny) Ducky, you guessed it. I'm not coming back I am so sorry for walking this way. But it wouldn't have been possible otherwise. You know that as well as I do. And it has to be now. (Song: "Welcome" by Slut) (melancholy guitar song) (Danny) I'm scared to wait any longer. Afraid of what is coming. And that I can no longer do it. If you can't forgive me for walking like this then it's okay. I just hope one day you can understand. You will be happy. You will see. Remember Me. ILove You.
