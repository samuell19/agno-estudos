[instrumental music] [siren wailing in distance] [upbeat techno music] -This uptown downtown one train to South Ferry approaching the station. Please stand away from the platform edge. [music continues] [sirens blaring] -Everything we do is a transition and I feel like a lot of people can, you know relate to that experience. People dressed me up to be somethin' else. I was socialized to be somethin' else and now I have to, you know deconstruct all of that to get to where I was supposed to be because if you left it up to me I would have been like this since I was four, when I said I was a girl. [indistinct chatter] -...creme brûlée. -Hi! How are you? [indistinct chatter] -In a heteronormative society everyone's the same. That's what they promote. The Kiki scene is a space for youth development. Everyone's unique and the Kiki scene is a place for young people to explore that uniqueness. -The word is Kiki. Kiki. -Kiki. -Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, Kiki. Let. Let's go. Ready, let's go. [rap song] -Can I see the legendary Chi Chi! ♪ I'm thinking about dick bitch ♪ ♪ I'm thinking about dick bitch.. ♪♪ -Not everybody's gonna understand the dynamic and concept of what ballroom is or what the Kiki scene is especially, you know. But for me, I look at it as a safe haven a -- a place that allows, you know youth that, that haven't been, you know fortunate or given the opportunity, you know to have the family, the friends or have that support or network in place to come and find that. You know, it's a safe haven. [indistinct chatter] -How you doin'? -Tired. -Hi. -Hey. -I know, honey. I see you from -- from a distance. I had to get.. Ah! You just got back? -Yeah, literally. -Like, right now. -Like, right now. -How are you? [sighs] -I'm okay -The eye story say, &quot;Oh!&quot; -It was a lot this week. It was good though. -Girl, we're gonna have to get this.. -I haven't twisted it yet -- -You're giving me like.. You're giving me like, girl hobo chic with a little urban, um, Bob Marley. -I got to get it twisted again. -Hi, Twiggy. -Hey. -Hi, Twiggy. -Rejection, homophobia lack of acceptance, um.. ...these are, like, the key things in my opinion at least, from my perspective that.. ...are the adversities that stem to all these other issues. [indistinct chatter] -We don't have, we have our status in the ballroom. ♪ Up up ♪♪ -There was something known as, um they called it the Harlem Drag Circuit. They were more, like, masquerade type of events. Throughout the time, the '60s, '70s, '80s it kind of, like, transitioned. And, and evolved into this whole different competitive scene um, that is, is now called the Ballroom scene. [upbeat music] ♪ Up up ♪♪ [indistinct chatter] This subset of that ballroom scene which is called the Kiki scene the youth as, as low as age 12 and 13 they have these same types of balls as a creative outlet to get away from all of the things that put them at risk the homelessness, the disease the lack of acceptance, all these other things. [indistinct chatter] [car engine revving] [indistinct chatter] -But remember we probably gonna be saving some space for like.. -It's in the boxes outside. -In the boxes?

I welcome you all to the Legends Ball sponsored by HEAT and GBAND, give it up! [applause] [rap music] [upbeat music] [applause] [indistinct chatter] -Working a ball is just as simple as that. There's a theme of the ball and the theme of the ball basically sets the tone of the categories. The categories basically describe what they're looking for in each particular category. [upbeat music] [indistinct chatter] So a runway, they might be calling for an all black or couture look. For Vogue Fem they might be calling the look of a rock star. Anything that it calls for, that's the look of the night. [upbeat music] If the judges like it then we'll all battle for the -- for the cash category. If not, if the judges don't like what they see on the flip side, they'll chop you.

If you're walking, so, Shannon.. [chuckling] -I remember, like, bein' young and bein' in school and knowing, but I always used to fight it, like &quot;No, that can't be possible, that's not true.&quot; And I just really fought it for a long time. 'Cause I didn't really believe it and bein' the way I was raised, like my dad's, like, a macho man and, like, being raised in Harlem and this type of thing, like.. It's kind of, like the perception of a guy, or a young boy growing up you have to be masculine, you have to play sports and you have to do this, that and the third. So I had to, I felt like I had to live up to that because my parents would be disappointed or my dad would be really upset. I remember, like, bein' in school and, um.. ...we had like, we had like activities after school like, when it would end, and I joined like, this thing where we danced and I had a dance instructor and I remember she.. We did a dance to this song called &quot;Peaches And Cream&quot; by 112, and we did the dance. And I came home to show my dad, 'cause I was just so excited I was in dance, I'm was like, &quot;Oh, yeah&quot; so, I came home to show my dad the dance and I'm like, &quot;Look&quot;, and I'm in the living room doin' the dance he was, like, he was so upset. So I just went into my room, like my mom was, like, &quot;Don't dance.&quot; [instrumental music] -Hey, look at her, look at her. Bam! Watch out for the street, girl. [laughing] [indistinct chatter] -I'm known as a very strong person and I always had to be, growin' up. When you're one of a kind, you get targeted and, um, I guess, like as a defense mechanism to fight off attacks against my identity I come off as very serious and no-nonsense. And I'm tall, and I'm very imposing um, if I walk down the street pleasant I would probably be attacked and bullied. That was a nice little ball. [indistinct chatter] -Fuck her right in the pussy! -Oh, my God. -What y'all doing? -We're celebrities. -Pussy.. -Oh, my God she caught that.. Right, I told you these kids.. [indistinct chatter] Do not play with me, little boy. Hold up. Hold on, I'm sorry. Hold on, do not play with me, do not play with me. 'Cause I will slap the shit out of one of y'all. Do not play with me. Right, do not be disrespectful. I don't know y'all. It's not funny. 'Cause I will slap the shit out of you and make you go get your fuckin' brother. Why does everyone brand you.. Your mother's a faggot! No, I wanna, I want him to come here, so I can rock him. [indistinct chatter] -I'm triggered. -You're triggered? -Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm serious. -You're okay? -No. -No? -Who was I before ballroom? I was a person who.. ...was lost. Um, I was a person who wasn't confident in my ability to do. Um, and, because I found a community that appreciates me and all of me, um.. Like, I'm able to be myself. -Honestly, like, I'm not trans but -- but, I'm not transgender but I would say, if you really look at the term and view it for what it is I am in the cont.. like, fall within the continuum because, like, I do identify as a man but, there's something about me that's n.. different like, I'm a man. I know I'm a man. But I'm different and that's me, like I'm just, I'm of trans experience but I'm not, you know completely, I won't, you know.. If I was comfortable enough to come her in drags I would. You know, I just need, like, a buddy like, if someone was doin' it with me, I would do it 'cause we could go through the experience together.. This clip happened even before I started transitionin'. I probably started, maybe, like.. Actually, for a fact I started the next semester.. ...because I went back trans. [indistinct chatter] -She called me three years ago on the phone and said to me &quot;Ma, I made a decision to live my life as a woman&quot;. And I'm like, &quot;What?&quot; So then I thought about it for a minute while she was on the phone. I said &quot;Whatever your decision is, I'm with you.&quot; I accept it. I think she's sexy, like me. Feel me? She's beautiful. Like me. What? She is. Um.. You know, I know about Gia's friend that they beat up on 129th Street and they killed him, her. You know, um.. I worry about that stuff. I mean, if I didn't care, I wouldn't worry. -Usually people will tell you there's things you're not supposed to do, there's things you are supposed to do. Gia's steppin' into a new boundary. She's basically defying the law of science. Who would of knew a male could develop breasts go get a breast change, a sex change. I feel like Gia's a, she's a very big role model and inspiration to people and I think people should look at that more 'cause there is no difference between any human being. -Gia's phenomenal. I'mma tell you when she was 12, 13 years old she was the number one debater of the city and when she was 16 years old, or 17 years old she became the number one debater of the state. So, she's phenomenal. [indistinct rap song on stereo] -If you don't know what a house is it's just a, in our vernacular uh, what we call a team. So, team is just, we just use the word &quot;House&quot; for the word team. For you to be a house mother or father which is also known as the team captain, um the responsibilities that you have to hold as a house mother or father at 16 years old um, you have a house full of 15, 20 plus members and you have to cater to all of them. That's a lot of responsibility for a young teenager who might come from parents who have thrown them out in the street and become homeless, you know. They say we often become the parents we never had and we help each other like, the guidance that we have for each other. [indistinct chatter] -My name is Symba. My role in the Kiki scene, I'm one of the commentators. [indistinct chatter] You stay. Give them a round of applause. [applause] The next prize.. [indistinct chatter] When you come into the scene, you, you create a family. You have gay brothers, gay sisters and you can pick your gay parents or your gay parents pick you. You know, you, you find the people you fit in with and everybody loves you as if they're family. [upbeat music] [indistinct chatter] [cheering] [cheering] -Let me tell y'all something. When y'all are at a ball and I repeat this time and time again. Y'all are there to represent this house. Y'all can walk.. Hold on, I'm telling y'all this the minute that y'all go out there and ruin it for the next bitch I will cut the string short and I will tell y'all that y'all on blackout and I will start picking balls for y'all and I would hate to do that. [indistinct chatter] -Hold on. -Stop sayin' my name. You and you, and I'm dead.. Stop saying my name, and I'm dead. Stop! Stop sayin' my name! Or I'm deadass. -Hold on. Sit down, sit down. -I'm not playin' with you! -Chocolate. Chocolate. -I'm dead serious. -Take him outside. Take him outside. -I'm dead serious. I'm not playin' with you. -And that's what I told y'all about playin'. See what y'all get for playin'? That's why I tell y'all, y'all need to listen. -Somebody quit. -Hold on. This is what I don't want happening in front of other houses. This type of act. Because this.. You know what -- what that's gonna do. I'm co.. I'm talkin' now. I'm gonna be fierce now. If that goes on, I'm tellin' y'all bitches is puttin' straight up out this house. Y'all, I'mma tell you, I'm a fierce motherfuckin' cookie. I will put mothers, fathers nephews, cousins everybody out the house. I will go into this house ball with ten motherfucking members and appreciate those ten members that I have if y'all cannot cooperate with what we're doing. [indistinct chatter] -Everybody get registered to vote. 'Cause if you're not, go sign up now to vote. Please vote now. -Please vote now. -So you know, we know that Obama's.. You know the whole presidential election a lot of agencies are being hit hard. So the agencies that y'all are used to the GMACs, the FACEs, the Harlem Uniteds, the Mount Sinais some of those places might not be there in the next few years if, if we don't get Obama into office. I'm talkin' about major cutbacks, from HIV health care to STDs, to hospitals, to everything that you can imagine that affects us, will be affected. You got to understand that when you have people fighting over money, the Republicans don't understand why they, why you know, we need these resources 'cause it doesn't affect their community. It only affects the people who are less fortunate all the -- all the people of color. -Word. [indistinct chatter] -I wonder how different things would be if I wasn't Chi Chi Mizrahi. For the last eight years since I've been named Chi Chi that's who, you know, I've been living as. And it's like, Francisco Gonzales was who I was before then. I was a young boy. I didn't know.. Scared, I guess. But before then I was hanging out with the straight people. -Express train is now arriving on the upper level. Please stand away from the platform edge. [indistinct chatter] -See, that's why I never use lotion. I hate lotion. -Really? Never use lotion ever in my life. -What do you put on? -Nothing.. The first time I met Zariya was almost two years ago. Umm.. she came to one of the, um, ball practices. And, so when I walk into the room I had looked over and she was sitting by the doorway and she was sitting right there, I was like &quot;Oh, wow, you're, you're beautiful.&quot; [indistinct chatter] -I wasn't aware that it was, like, a house. -A house meeting. It is like an open house. -But.. Open house, basically, like, for new members. I was really, like, newbie to the scene. So I just was sitting in my own little corner and then I just remember you approaching me and I'm like, he was, I don't know, it was just weird 'cause I never really had no.. anybody stand in front of me and say, like, &quot;You're gorgeous.&quot; -Are you excited about-- -Yes, I'm so excited. Like.. It's his first ball walking. It's his first time ever walking a ball in the Kiki house real scene, walking face. What up! And this is my daughter, come here daughter. Say hi, daughter. This is my daughter, Zay. -Hi. -Hi. -So what do you think about this, daughter? This is what I'm thinking about doing.. Cause you're gonna have the jacket and you're gonna have the foof at the bottom. And this is gonna be cut up the middle and then, I ha- then we're gonna find you some tights or something like that. You got it? -Alright. -You look nervous. Why you look nervous? -Uh, no, it's not, it's not that. -'Cause you are? Are you skeptical? Are you a little worried? -About the walk? -Uh-huh. -Not worried, I.. When I came out into the scene the scene helped me realize that transition was possible from a male to a female and to be able to live the life, you know that you want to live. ♪ All you people look at me like I'm a little girl ♪ ♪ Well did you ever think it be okay ♪ ♪ For me to step into this world ♪ ♪ Always saying little girl don't step into the club.. ♪♪ -Have fun. Take your time. Y'all look fucking awesome. Sell it! -That was young, like I.. I think when I came to the scene, I was, like, 16. -Sixteen? -So, going through puberty and seeing myself, be like, getting more masculine like, that was frightening. My home situation wasn't, like.. My parents aren't very supportive. So, I don't know, it was just, at that time I was going through certain things that they wouldn't understand. So that's when I started to realize, gradually, that you know, this is something I wanted to do that you know, I would see, like the friends that I have around me and then realizing that it's possible to be happy living this lifestyle. You know, some people want to transition but they don't have the courage to do it. But I just thought, like, I couldn't, like, you know I couldn't contain it, like so, this is the step I want to take. When I get to the point where I, like, when I'm while I'm through my transition, you know, this year you know, taking hormones and everything like that. When I achieve the look I want, or get somewhere close then I'll get my name changed and then be 24/7 and just go through with it. [dogs barking] [indistinct chattering] -My name is Divo. I've been in the Kiki scene for a good four years now. I'm very to myself, like, unless I'm comfortable. And I'm comfortable voguing. I learned how to vogue going to The Door on Spring Street. I used to watch the girls come in and go to the Kiki lounges and stuff and I used to observe them. I wasn't really fully out about myself then. I was still more in the closet, so, anything that was too feminine to me was funny at that time. So now that I kinda accept myself more it doesn't seem as funny, and -- and like after a while, like, it kind of grew on me so I wanted to learn it, so after I learned it I fell in love with it, really. [rap music] I used to vogue on the train platforms and the Chinese restaurant. People used to give us money because they didn't know what the heck we was doing. [music continues] [cheering] [rhythmic clapping] -There's no real dance here. All we're talking about.. In our categories, we're labeled, right? Female figure face, male face female figure body, male body. But we, we also go beyond that because you have those who come as the twinks who walk female figure realness. The one thing that -- that changes societies norms of masculinity, femininity, is the fact that in ballroom we can be whatever we want to be, you know what I'm saying? I can choose to be masculine or feminine. I can choose to get up in them and sell it like this or I can choose to be up in them and still sell it like this. Who's to say a -- a female can't be hardcore and sell it like masculine, but still be feminine in features, you know what I'm saying? In this house, I don't want us to have labels. Simply this, you walk realness. Doesn't matter what realness it is but you know that whoever your character is, is real. It's automatic, it's you. No one can tell you that it's not. It's you, you're real. [upbeat music] Yeah I'm looking at you to sell it. You got to sell it to me. You saw that change? She was, like, nervous, and then I asked &quot;Do you find yourself sexy?&quot; &quot;Of course, yes!&quot; You saw how your body went from straight square, &quot;I'm nervous&quot; to, &quot;I'm sexy, yes, of course!&quot; I'm selling because I'm comfortable in me. I know that I'm sexy. So I'm just selling it in the way that I can. No matter what. But I'm never keeping my eyes off you. If there's a judges of panels if there's a panel of judges I'm selling it to every last person. Let me see it again. -I need a breeze. I'm gonna make this a disclaimer. I'm not a drag queen nor a fem queen or a women of trans experience I just like to play in women's clothing, okay? [laughs] This is my favorite section. See the size 12 here, people? See how big this shoe is? Woman, man. Man, woman. Woman, man. Manly woman. Womanly man. There we go. So these are my boots for the weekend. Okay. [sighs] The normal reaction of usually ladies inside they will all be looking at me really funny. Like, &quot;Oh, why is this guy trying on women's boots for?&quot; And they're thinking, like, &quot;Oh, maybe he's a drag queen or maybe he's just like this&quot; but they don't forget that we're also artistic and there's certain things that us men cannot retrieve that women have, so, we just, you know.. I don't say I'm a cross dresser, but, I mean for the entertainment value, why not? Okay. You see this? See that? See that? See that? Hah. High kickin' and everything, America. They're nice, they're edgy. I just got to finish them off. I'll put some spikes on them some -- some thumbtacks, some studs and get them up to the point where I need them. Oh, I wish this wasn't black. Look at this nice little belt in black. Going across, that's very high fashion, right? Very, like, Comm de Garçon about it. I'm just excited. It's been a while since I've walked a ball. Kiki ball. Like got it, in the affect and everything.

[indistinct chatter] It is so hot. I'm wearing leather and I feel like all the energy is coming out of my pores right now. But, I'm ready to walk. -Thank you.. -Don't you judge me, okay? -Is Millie here? [upbeat music] -What is that? What category? What category? What category? Okay, work.

Africa, what category are they on? -Um, face. Right now. -Okay. I'll be right back. -No problem. This -- this detail cost me $45. I'm glad that's over. Now I can start the party. [instrumental music] -When I first came out I was, I guess you could say, a pier head and, like, a lot of my friends, like, we used to, like stay on the pier and vogue all day all night until the pier closed. And then we'll leave and probably still not head home just walk around the city until we got tired of walking around the city and go home. Honestly if it wasn't for the pier, like there wouldn't be no Divo. [siren blaring] -Police! [indistinct chattering] -I feel like society is startin' to look at us all the same and it's not fair. I've been arrested probably three times my whole life. They treated us like garbage, like, just straight garbage and it was, it was embarrassing. It was hurtful. And I never thought that I would feel like that 'cause I've always been the type of person to not care. But I actually really felt hurt after a while because they was really treatin' us like &quot;Oh, 'cause you're in the ballroom scene &quot;I know y'all do this, I know y'all do that. &quot;We've arrested so many people from this type of house or da-da-da-da,&quot; like, it was just like they was treatin' us, like.. we're all the same person and people sort of realize regardless if we all label under gay, label under lesbian label under transgender, whatever, we're all individuals. -It's so funny, the police in The Village tend to be the most homophobic. Which is weird. You know this is weird. Our &quot;subculture,&quot; our community comes to congregate and just have fun but the police, they are, like, horrible. -They're rude. -Really disrespectful.

Like, looking around you don't see many opportunities, like, I mean, like, like you don't see nothin' that says &quot;Hey, like, I can make it,&quot; you know what I mean? -I just believe that everyone should be proud of where they, where they come from. This is where I'm from. I live in New York, but I'm from Virginia. This is my high school. -Wow, this is fancy. -It's very stereotypical. Very stereotypical and very homophobic where.. How I grew up. So, it wasn't okay for a man to be openly feminine or openly gay especially if you were part of the church. I was 14 or 15. I was told that, um, people were bringing up my mannerisms and then that led them to believe that I was gay and that, if I didn't change how I was acting that they would ask me to leave the church. I was always at church. Everybody knew that I was always at church.. ...and, um, it really hurt. It really hurt. -Put it on me. I don't want, I don't want the gloss. -Just the lipstick? -Mm-hm. Do I need lip gloss? -Uh-uh. -Okay. [laughing] He's my makeup artist. If you're gay, you still can be spiritual and no one can ever take away your salvation. He told me as a teenager, I think. Right? You were in high school. -High school. -Yes. He was in high school. And at that time I thought it was just a phase. And then later when he went to New York he says, &quot;Mom, no it's not. It's not just a phase. I'm gay.&quot; I told him I loved him no matter what. I didn't accept it at first, like I should have. I did not, I'll be honest with you. Um, but like I said, knowledge is a powerful thing and as I began to research, um about the LGBT community, and gay I do know and I believe in my heart that children can be born gay. -All these layers and levels and intersections that happen with just anyone being who they are. So, a young black man, that's one thing. And then, a young black gay man, that, like, adds another layer. Um, and then, if you present yourself anyone, whether it's me or someone else va -- varying on your gender expression so, if you're more masculine or more feminine that, like, can change the conversation or how people perceive you or treat you too. So there's, like, all these different layers and that's just for someone like me, who's a black, gay man you know, a young, black, gay man. But then, what if it's a trans woman or a lesbian or a -- -A trans man. -Or a trans man. Or like.. So there's all these, yeah. -Are they treated the same? -Worse. -Sometime worse. -I think people who are transgender or of trans experience are treated worse. It's much harder for them. -There are a lot of parents that can't deal with the issue of them coming out of the closet. Um, but you should never tell your child to get out of the home. That's just wrong. Pray about it, go to therapy, if you have to. But never tell your child to get out of the house. -You were able to, to find this understanding. -Yes. -What about Twiggy's father? -He didn't accept it. I'm not going to say anything bad about Ryan's father but he did not accept it. He said it was my fault. He blamed me. Um, but he didn't accept it. Yes. [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [music continues] -How long ago since you were here? -Nine years old. -Nine years old? [engine revving] -I'm that type of person. I don't like to.. ...let my situation run my life because there's always something out there worse than yours. So what's the sense in me walking around with my head down. There's people out here going through way worse than me. -What would it be like to, to vogue here? How would that be? Like, would that feel weird? -It would be very weird. [laughs] It's like -- -Well, how would people react? Like, what would, you know, why -- -It wouldn't be a cute reaction. Not too many people that are homosexual in this area are open like that. So.. So actually, when I was growing up here I wasn't out so for them to see me like this now, they wouldn't know how to accept it. I always felt like I was in the wrong skin growin' up because I liked girls but.. It was always a part of me that I liked boys too. So my mother, she kinda influenced it but I didn't understand why she was so upset as I got older and I told her the truth, that I was. It would be times, like, if me and my mother would get into some argument, she would kick me out and I wouldn't necessarily have anywhere to go and she wouldn't care. There was times I slept on the train. Desperate times when I would, like, stayed on people's couches. So, like, I've dealt with a lot. [indistinct chatter] -Oh, Ziraya's dancing. Oh, there she goes, there she goes. [laughs] Ziraya Voguing. [indistinct chatter] -I got my Adam's apple shaved. I had my hairline lowered. Yeah, chin shaved. I had my hairline lowered, my brow bones shaved. [indistinct] You can see my hairline if I take this.. This goes off by the way. But it's really subtle? -Makes you a whole different person now. -I do have my days when I'm a little paranoid. When I feel like there are boys staring at me and they're, like, you know, trying to they call it 'getting in', feel like they're trying to get in you know, kinda see, what my gender identity is. And then there are days when I'm like okay, they're just looking. And when I first had FF surgery which is facial feminization. And that's from, him, I guess, making an incision right here and I had, like, an Adam's apple that was somewhat prominent so I had that shaved. Um, I also had, this is a wig. [laughs] I also had my, um, my hairline lowered. So, that's why I'm wearing the wig to kind of, you know, allow my hair to breath I'm just guarding it properly. And that's from the hairline lowering. So it goes straight across my forehead. You should see the other side. The procedure is really quick. Um, I'm kinda healing really quickly, very well. Um, it doesn't hurt. Are you aware of what a gaft is? Basically it's a contraption, um, that many trans women use to conceal their lady parts. That day I got out of the shower and I put on a gaft. My mother, like, busts in my room, she sees me and just imagine seeing, like, I guess your sixteen-year-old son standing there with, every, like, it looks like there's nothing there. Everything's concealed. And she's like, &quot;What the fuck do you have on?&quot; She said, &quot;What you are doing is un-fucking natural.&quot; And then I was, I said, &quot;That's not for you to decide what's natural, what's unnatural.&quot; She came back in the room and she said, &quot;What did you say to me?&quot; and then she smacked me. She was crying, and then, like she, like, took me by my throat and slammed me into the wall. And she said, &quot;If this is the life you wanna live then get your shit and get the fuck out my house.&quot; From there I ran to Chi Chi's job and I don't usually, like, I'm not really like, you know very emotional so like, when something, like, causes me to cry and, like, it would have to, like, really, like, you know something really strong and like, something that really, like, impacted me, you know? -That was a hard day. 'Cause, I -- I didn't even know what to do. Like, you don't ever prepare yourself for somethin' like that. Like, what do you do? Like. Like, how much can you help? Like, what do you say? What do you do? How do you react? [siren blaring] -A lot of our young people are finding ways to survive. And the great thing about our young people is that they're one of a kind. They have these survival mechanisms that they learn. Um, because of what they go through. A lot of us, I believe, don't have families who support us when we come out of the closet. A lot of families don't support us when we decide we wanna transition. And, so, when we deal with those battles. We go out into the world saying, &quot;How are we going to make it?&quot; And, in New York City, one of the greatest cities in the world, um, you need money to survive. And how do we get that when people aren't hiring us? How do we get that when people aren't supporting us? We need a way to survive. We need a way to eat. We need a way to transition, for those who transition. How am I gonna pay for my hormones? -Can everybody please sign the HMI sign-in sheet that's going around that's colorful on the top? -Hello. Hello! -I'm not gonna talk over y'all. That's no shade. I'm really not. So the way that it's set up is that there's the Kiki Coalition, period, right? And then there's the CVO body and there's the Parent's body. We all together make up the Kiki Coalition and that's the checks and balances. So if you have an issue then, yes you're more than welcome to come. -Um, We're looking at a pandemic, um, in our community. And I don't think we understand that 60 percent of black men will be HIV positive by the time they're 40. Um, 60 percent, that's more than half of this room will be HIV positive at some point in their life before they're 40. -Hello, everyone. Um, I just wanna start off by saying, is that I think that this panel is very unique. The Kiki scene is composed of the youth. You know, a lot of times we target you know, the most at risk populations. Within the LGBTQ community we have homelessness we have disease such as HIV. Um, police injustices, sexual exploitation. -I had an experience where I had a sugar daddy at that age and he took me to a party where it was just everyone having sex and whatever, and I did some things. And as a result of that, it took me about three years after that to get tested and the reason why's because because of the setting and because of me knowing what happens in that environment. I automatically told myself &quot;Okay, well, it's like, 50 people in here and, you know, God forbid, you're already HIV positive.&quot; So I had it in my mentality for three years that I was positive. I lived my life, day by day, just going ahead. Didn't really speak about the topic. Didn't really go get tested because once you put yourself in that mentality, like, it was just I didn't want the confirmation. So when I finally got tested and it came back negative I was shocked. Like, you can ask my brothers, like, I was literally just sitting there for, like, ten minutes. Like, &quot;I don't believe this, test me again.&quot; -So I remember, um, I was home and one of my gay children were staying with me at that time and I just remember, like, very rapidly starting to get sick. Like, flu-like symptom, kind of. And because I was honest with myself about the behavior that I'd been taking part of, uh, prior to that in my head, I just said to myself. &quot;It happened. I'm HIV positive.&quot; And I was just so strong about it. And I just knew. So, um, it was a day in July um, I woke up and my gay son was layin' next to me and I told him, &quot;I'm leaving.&quot; And he was like, &quot;Where you going?&quot; I was like, &quot;I'm going to get tested.&quot; And it was on a weekday. I don't remember what day of the week it was. But I went to the Department of Health and I got tested and, um, I'd been tested there before. So usually, um, because they're unprofessional um, if you're negative, while you're sitting in the concierge lobby area they'll tell you out loud, &quot;Oh your test is fine. You can go home.&quot; This day was very different. Um, the guy came to me and he said follow him to the back. That's when I knew. And, um, he sat me down and he sat right across from me and he was speaking. I heard him and then he said my test came out positive and he kept speaking and everything after that was a blur. Um, and, I was just.. Although I knew, I was a bit dumbfounded. Like, &quot;Did he just say that?&quot; Because he just kept talking there wasn't, like, no concern in his voice or anything. And I asked, I said, &quot;Did you just say my test was positive?&quot; And he said, &quot;Yeah.&quot; And in that moment, I didn't cry. Nothing. The only thing I thought to myself was, &quot;Shit, I became a statistic.&quot; [indistinct chatter] -Okay, everybody, like, gather, like not be so separate. We're startin' with a moment of silence. Our community is on very intimate terms with death and, and, that, that comes from complications from HIV. It comes from police brutality, it comes from all sorts of health issues, it comes from suicide. Um, it comes from hate crimes, um, it comes from -- A lot of things. Obviously, we're gathered here in honor of Travis. It was somethin' about him from the very first time I saw him that it -- it was just this light about Travis just like all these candle lights here. Um, Travis was a friend. He was a son, a -- a brother, a sister to many. And I know it's a sad occasion when anyone passes but you have to think about it from the perspective of, his last month here he was in a lot of pain and Travis isn't in pain anymore. And the guiding light that so many of you speak about he can still continue to be. So today, I say that Travis didn't die. Travis lives on through each and every one of you who showed up today. And Travis we speak your name. ♪ Why should ♪ ♪ I feel ♪ ♪ Discouraged? ♪ ♪ And why ♪ ♪ Should the shadows ♪ ♪ Come? ♪ ♪ Why should my heart ♪ ♪ Feel lonely? ♪ ♪ And long ♪ ♪ For heaven ♪ ♪ And home? ♪♪ -I used to get abused when I was younger. I kind of went through it all. I went through the emotional abuse. Like the verbal. I went through the physical.

And I didn't open up about it until I got older so even to this day it's kind of hard for me to deal with it. And so I kinda lashed out in the outside world instead of on my family. That's why I used to get suspended a lot. The ball scene really did help me because when I vogue like, that's why I give so much when I vogue because it's more of an emotion. Like, Voguin' is not just a dance to me. Voguin' is a art. It's somethin', it's, like, a outlet to me.

What does it mean for the black LGBT community? For our story, ballroom is a part of that story to not be anywhere. Rockland Palace was a space in the 1920s and 30s where the original drag balls were held. Thousands of people gathered at Rockland Palace to see these drag balls. And it was a space in which black and brown LGBTQ people, um, in Harlem were able to be who they felt were their true selves and to express themselves. [instrumental music] I'm Twiggy, this is Sara Jordeno. Um, January of this year we started a project to expose the Kiki scene to mainstream society. While we were doing research, we discovered this place which in the 1920s and 30s was Rockland Palace where the original Harlem Drag Balls were held. So tonight we are gonna reincarnate this place and have a Kiki ball here. Many of you know Travis Fetch Pucci, rest in peace. Um, who we lost earlier this year so I want to thank someone special that's in the crowd. Travis' mother. [crowd cheering] [rap music] [rap music] -Uh-uh. [indistinct chatter] -Whose coming? Come on? Somebody come with me. [rap music] -Point one. Two-one, three-one, four-one. Four, four-two. -When people step onto the ballroom floor. They're, they're, not just competing in a category. They're tellin' their story. So, someone who walks is telling you, &quot;I am beautiful.&quot; This is who I am. I'm lovely, no matter what you say, no matter what you think. I am beautiful. -No one ever understood me growin' up. Like, you have boys and you have girls and, like, I didn't wanna be with the boys and I couldn't be with the girls and so I was always, like, left alone. In order for my mother to make ends meet. She had to put one of her kids on the line and I was the one chosen to be-to go to special ed. To get money to, to help take care of their child. I did act out. I had, I didn't, I had behavioral problems. I felt like I had to be big and bad in order to not be bullied. Because I was so feminine. And especially when it's a system that fails students like myself, you never learn. I got myself out, like, I advocated for myself at 12 years old to get out of that. Um, and I did because I didn't need it. [indistinct chatter] It's like, I've, I've self-advocacy is all I have. That's all I ever had. Um, and I don't, and I don't blame anyone because I just wonder, like, &quot;Why me?&quot; Like, why was I chosen to be that one. It resulted in more teasing, you know, more fighting because I was fri -- I wasn't normal, you know? Um, but I did it and I, and I removed myself from it and I excelled. ♪ Gia ♪ ♪ Juicy ah ♪ ♪ Gia ah yeah ♪ ♪ Gia ah yeah ♪ ♪ Runway ah yeah ♪ ♪ Gia ah.. ♪♪ I'm the first one to go to college.

You can't be ashamed of me. Like, I've traveled. I have a good job, like, I have education. -I did great at school but, it's like, I dropped out of school in ninth grade Used drugs early so I just asked myself like, what made me, like, where, like -- Where was I at in, in my life to make me wanna do these things? You know what I mean? And still, even, you know, you know, even to this day I ask myself, you know, when, like, I go out to the club sometime and I'm, you know, doin' a molly or I'm smokin' a blunt or I'm havin' a cocktail. Like, what's making me do this? Am I enjoying it? Am I doing it 'cause I want to? Or, am I doing it 'cause it's -- it's an escape and it's comfort, it's normal for me.

And, I mean, I still can ob -- obtain it but I spent so much on -- on life just living but I don't know how much quality of living I've put towards actually bettering myself. [instrumental music] I was working. I had a job. I had my own, I had my, a roommate that that I was living with and I mean, he didn't even know until I was able to verbally tell him like, this is my issue. He was, like, &quot;Look at you, like, you work all this time&quot; &quot;and you bust your ass and here you are. &quot;You know, doin' everything for everybody &quot;and this is how you want to leave your legacy. &quot;Is for people to think that after all the great things&quot; &quot;you've done, that you were just a drug addict? [instrumental music] [music continues] -Hi. I'm looking for, um, the elastic, like long elastic but with the sequins on it. So, like, this is my body, I guess so I want it coming down, like this and then.. -And the back also? -And on the back also. Like from my shoulder to.. Okay. My dad is very aggressive. He's, He's, like, a macho man. He's very, he's very aggressive. He's, he's got, sometimes he can be scary so I was scared to tell him.. 'cause I didn't know how he would react and my mother didn't know how he would react either 'cause she knows how he is. So we basically kept it from him for, like, six years. Then I eventually told him. I told him right before New Year's and I was scared to call him and tell him 'cause I didn't know with his voice. I was scared. So, I texted to him. And the way it happened, it just happened all so perfectly because, um, around that time he would ask my brothers and sisters, &quot;Um, hey, is Chris gay?&quot; And they knew and they were just protecting me so they would say, &quot;Oh no, I don't know I don't think he is, just, just, brushing it off.&quot; And then one time he asked my little brother, who's 16. He had said, he asked him if I'm gay and then my brother said, &quot;No.&quot; And then he said, &quot;Well, if he's scared to tell me or if he is, just tell him he doesn't have to be scared. He can tell me.&quot; So when I, when my little brother told me that I felt, like, a sigh of relief like, &quot;Okay, finally.&quot; So I text him and I said, &quot;I heard you were asking Justin&quot; which is my brother. &quot;Um, if I was gay or not&quot; And he was, like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; And I said, &quot;Well, I am and I was scared to tell you 'cause I was scared how you'd react.&quot; And he was just, he said the same thing my mom said, like, &quot;You're my son. I'm gonna love you regardless and that's just that. You do what you wanna do with your life.&quot; And he later on he told me that he cried afterwards. [clamoring] [rap music] -Alright, alright, alright! Grand prize! Ladies and gentlemen, tonight.. -Nice. It's unreal! [indistinct chatter] -That's one of mine. -And so, again, like I was talking about the house and ballroom scene, I came into a community with people and a structure that is...family. Um, the very structure of a house takes on of a takes on the structure of a family and, so, the, the leaders of the house are called the mother and the father and the members.. So I've been in True Colors for a year and a month. At True Colors, I am a program officer. I am one of a staff of six who do national work to end LGBTQ youth homelessness. I didn't want to apply at first because the position required well, preferred a master's degree and I don't even have a bachelor's degree. And I got the job. -The White House. Why'd it have to be, why'd the White House have to be white? Why couldn't it be a red house? Why couldn't it be the Black and White House? -Like, we're a family for documentaries and, like.. -Why couldn't it be the Rainbow House? -This way and then.. -No, this is going to be the long way. Well, what are you, what are you tryin' to do? -Well, well, get into the White House.. We have, we have an event to go to. Um, the LGBT reception is today. -Oh, yeah, okay, it's that side -Yeah you can go to 15th street and make a right. -Uh-huh. [indistinct chatter] -So, the civil rights of LGBT Americans. Uh, this is an issue whose time has come. And, uh, we've got a lot to celebrate uh, because of your hard work and -- and there are people here who've been working these issues for decades. And of course, uh, we're now waiting the Supreme Court's ruling on whether same-sex couples nationwide have the equal right to marry. [audience cheering] -No, I'm not gonna stop them because you should assume.. [indistinct chatter] -Yeah, yeah. -So you off for the rest of the week? -This is work, honey. -Yeah, I know it is. -We had this wonderful time at the LGBT reception at the White House and I got a phone call from I guess you could call them my landlord in Harlem and.. The phone call was to say that we were getting evicted. And this was with no notice, no reason why, no anything. I had no home. And it's very ironic that I'm a national LGBT advocate for youth homelessness and I got evicted the day I got to the White House, right? I managed to get through that week without anyone but my best friend, Chi Chi and my partner, Chiffon Noway. And it's really important to me that people who see this film know that.. the support and the love that we have for each other. Um, it's what helps us get through these things.

To remove the ban from all states that have banned it. -&quot;Today is a big step in our march toward equality. &quot;Gay and lesbian couples now have the right to marry just like anyone else. Love wins.&quot; -POTUS. Hash-tag. -POTUS. -Ten years ago people weren't thinkin' about marriage. People weren't thinking about certain things because it was, it was so far ahead in the future. And now that it's here it's like, you know how does that shape the norm of how we view our relationships and the longevity of them, you know, like, how much we invest. How much, you know, we take out of it, how much we put into it. Those things, you know what I mean? -Right. We still got to fight for our equality in the workplace and non-discriminations for that. We still gotta fight for LGBT youth homelessness. We still gotta fight for trans rights. There's so much left. -The marriage thing was, it was, uh, it was like a gay white male's initiative, um, and..

So...yeah, we need to refocus and, like, put the same fight, now that we got this passed. The same lobbying and the grassroots, um.. ...fighting that went on.

So why we just don't create our own systems that work and are successful and that can uplift our communities? [rap music] -It's like, you know, the place where I can come and escape. You know, the, like, outside the everyday world. Like, the social injustices of society like, I can just escape everything and just, like, you know, come here to my place and really have me time. Like, this is where I can be like, emotional when I want to, this is where I can have friends over and this is where I can, like.. You know, it's -- it's like it's -- it's even where, I don't know how -- how to put that. Like I feel, like, I can actually I feel, like, actually I have a home to put it simply, you know. Um, I didn't feel like that back when I lived with my parents and with my mother. Life kinda changed really quickly for me. Many trans women are kinda, like, pushed in towards, like, sex work. So, um whilst being in college I kinda started, like, escorting here and there. Um, in terms of sex work I would say is -- it's very hard. I feel like everyone is different but, in a world that, um, like to put it simply, unless you are passable or have a certain look you can't walk into a workplace. Many places and get a job, um, you know, people discriminate. Um, and then there's also the outrageous cost of hormones and it's difficult to steer clear of sex work, you know. Um, especially in a -- a -- a within a scene that, it, like, the scene that kinda makes it so commonplace. -Like, it's nothing almost. -It's normalized. -It's -- It's very normalized. Um, it is difficult. -It's -- It's almost like, like, a social just, it's like a social norm. -Right. -Where you can just do it and that's just, that -- that's just, it's fine because we -- -Right. But I mean by saying -- -Everybody just understands, like, &quot;Okay, yeah, we just know that that's what she's doin' to make her money, to get her work done you know, to become the girl that, you know, she's desiring to be and that she wants to become, and it's like, okay.&quot; But you know, there's also other things that go along with it, you know? Things that.. -And then, you know, it may seem, it may not seem as difficult to, like, give a hand job to an anonymous John. You know, for money that, you know, will be able to take care of things and be comfortable within yourself as opposed to actually havin' to go through the process of getting a name change so you can legally be on paper a female of the United States and go to a job interview and be respected as how you identify. That's difficult, so, you know, it's -- it's very, it's very easy to get into sex work. It really is easy. Meeting clients that, you know, are, are kinda obsessed with you and what you are, um, can be validating in a sense because it makes you feel, it makes you feel like something. -When I was at a younger age, I was one of those people where I had to turn to escorting just to survive and to get ahead in life. My father and my family put me out at 17 and I had to survive. I had to do what I had to do. Thankfully, I'm here and I'm healthy and I'm alive to speak about it but not everyone gets that chance. I try to tell people to deviate away from sex work and a lot of people do it just because, like, &quot;Okay I'mma go pull this date so I can get a coin to pay for my wig, or to pay for my affect or to pay for my bead.&quot; And it's just, like people do it so they can look fab at a ball for a social fame but it's just, like, the ramifications that you're setting your body up for, you're setting yourself up. It doesn't add up, it doesn't measure up. People see the dollar amount and they see the fast life and the fast money and it attracts them especially when it comes to male workers 'cause they say, &quot;Okay well, uh butch queen could get $150 an hour just to, you know, chill with somebody or pull a date or whatever whereas a fem queen could get $500 so now the butch queen gets up in drags, puts on a wig and now starts pulling dates as a fem queen. Six months down the line, you're transitionin' just because you want the money. Like, that's the struggle. -I just want to say that if someone decides to transition because of sex work their transition should still be respected. Because, uh, they are still trans and I think that, often times in ballroom, we don't respect those transitions, um, because we don't deem them worthy. But, we have to look at, um, the lifestyle you talk.. We already addressed a lot of the issues that, um, we have to go through as marginalized people, who have been through so much, um, and we have to look at our value systems, right? Um, I think that for me, I have no problem with sex work, personally. There's no, if you're gonna sex work to get your affect, do it. Just do it safer. -Can I ask you a question? -Yeah, yeah, yeah -Do you feel somewhat disrespected? You, as a trans woman, that you're doin' it because that's who you are, do you feel disrespected by someone that just transitioned because it's affect was gonna make them socially famous? -Well, my, my transition has nothin' to do with someone else's. So, the reason why you transition um, is your reason and you have to live in that truth and I'm gonna live in my truth and we could be sisters or brothers. [laughs] And I, and I -- I, I think that that's somethin' that we, as a society, need to learn, like, if somethin' has nothin' to do with you, mind your business, like.. Like, I can't, I just know, I just know, like the harsh reality of livin' as a trans woman of color, um.. So, if you decide to live as a trans woman of color, you have courage. [rap music] -Ladies and gentlemen. Can I see one of the leaders of the underground Kiki scene This is Chi Chi, mother and father.. The legendary, Twiggy. Juicy go soft! Come judge for me. ♪ Now I can have a baby ♪ ♪ Feel like a gun -- 'cause I'm rich now ♪ ♪ Now I can feel they're Jamaican ♪ ♪ Get pregnant just a-like this now ♪ ♪ Feel it for a $1000 bitch do you want this $1000 ♪ ♪ Voguing for a $1000 ♪ ♪ Feel it for a $1000 ♪ ♪ Break down break down break down break it down ♪ ♪ Like this for a thousand.. ♪ -Right now, I'm like, I'm 25 years old like, it's not a game no more, reality is hittin'. I'm just trying to get another job now, and just make myself feel more accomplished outside of ballroom than I feel inside of ballroom right now. People write me randomly, and say &quot;Oh, you inspired me,&quot; and stuff like that. That actually makes me feel good 'cause I never pictured myself to be that person that people would write me from Paris and, like just random places saying, &quot;Oh, you inspire me.&quot; -All this for me? No, I'm joking. [Chi Chi laughs] My hair looks good? I'm -- I'm all set? Okay, great. -Smile. -It's my first time. -Oh, yeah? -My first passport. -Oh, that's great. -One step closer to Ireland. You know, now that Paris got it. Now that, you know, Italy and London and all these, and Sweden, and all these places. Now, we take it to Ireland. Our job is not done until all the countries have ballroom in it. Until all LGBTQ people have a place to go vogue and slam their backs. -When we get to Ireland, it'll be Saturday morning. -Mm-hm. -So, for the first time ever we are leaving the United States and going to Europe. We will be teaching, educating, performing in Belfast, Northern Ireland for Outburst their queer arts festival. Oh, these are cute. -Aren't they cute? -Where's this from? -Um, I'm really nervous about the class 'cause I'm teaching people that don't know how to vogue. So, it's the fact that I don't know, like how fast they're going to really catch on to it. But I'm just more, like, fascinated the fact that we can go there and teach them the culture. -It's now, it's just, you just gotta believe you have to just keep going with it, you know what I mean? You're at the front door. You don't own the building. This is not your establishment. You have to now solidify yourself. -When you think about all of these people and the institutions that say your life is of no value.. ...I'm hopeful that people doing this work can open people's eyes to that fact that they are of something. They are of all value. And that, when they realize that I feel like there'll be a shift. There'll be some type -- there's there'll be some sort of change. -Coming up, Gia! [rap music] Gia! -Pretty women wonder where my secret lies. I'm not built to suit a fashion model size. But when I start to tell them, they think I'm tellin' lies. I say, it's the fire in my eyes and the flash of my teeth the swing of my waist, and the joy in my feet. I'm a woman phenomenally, phenomenal woman. That's me. Men themselves have wondered, what they see in me. But they can't touch my inner mystery. I say, it's the click of my heels, the bend of my hair the palm of my hand, the need of my care. 'Cause I'm a woman, phenomenally. Phenomenal woman, that's me. [indistinct chatter] -Giving back to the community, the rest of your life. Giving back to the community. Safe sex, best sex. -Safe sex, the best sex. No glove, no love. -And if you are gonna do it kinky make sure you be safe about it. -Better be safe than sorry. All the time. Condoms, anybody? You want some condoms? -Like 150 years ago black people were not even human beings. Women, in general, didn't have the rights that we have today. So, when I look at, like, the leaders of those specific movements back in their time it gives me hope. Sometimes doctrines change and then belief systems change. And when belief systems change, then people get the rights that they deserve.
