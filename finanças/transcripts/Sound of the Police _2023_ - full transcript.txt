SALLY: City police officers helped in this process of retrieval. Police officers in northern cities like Boston were responsible, legally, to assist the bounty hunters in trying to recapture individuals who had done nothing other than try to claim their own freedom by running away. TERRY ANNE: The fact that there were bills that would announce that Black people need to be careful because the police are looking for them says to Black people that the police are their enemy. READER: Caution. Colored people of Boston, avoid conversing with police officers. They are empowered to act as kidnappers and slave catchers. Therefore, if you value your liberty, shun them in every possible manner. AL SHARPTON: There was no qualitative difference between law enforcement in the so-called free states and in slave catchers coming from the South. It was a hand-in-glove operation, all at the expense of Black freedom. The impact of 1850 was, it removed any hope that there was somewhere we could hide. TERRY ANNE: These laws foster a lot of distrust between free Black communities and police officers and white people in general.

JAMES: So, along with a colleague, we decided to start an alternative school that would give the very best to young people who had been in the juvenile system. What was so troubling to me was, the police were reinforcing, through their actions, the message that you will never be a full citizen. No matter what they're trying to tell you at this school about how you can overcome your past and you can be the best, that's bullshit. You were, are, and will be a criminal. [dial tone ringing] So we started calling up to the local precinct and saying, "We wanna have a meeting. And the officers came up to the school, and the students told their stories. One of the officers said, "What if the students "wear badges, "identifying themselves as students of the school, "and that way, we'll know "that they're students of this school "and they're not the people who are selling drugs on the corner?" But for our students, this idea that they should have to wear badges documenting their non-criminality was outrageous, and they exploded and the meeting all went to hell. But fundamentally, their outrage was justified. Two minutes. Two minutes. - Keep backing up. Two at the front. JAMES: Is everyone in? You? You? PERSON: In. JAMES All right.

DETAINEE: You guys are really doing a lot right now, huh? - And that points to the fact that the issue here is really more systemic.

So the problem is that we've given the police a mandate to fear the communities that most need their help. - Over time, I realized and heard from the Black community that they viewed us as an occupying force and not there for their protection and for their safety.

And working closely with him was Jack Webb, the star and producer of the show. - We checked out the names that you gave us, Mrs. Carson. Everyone who knows your little girl. STEPHEN: When I sold my first script to Dragnet, I was a young sergeant. I sold Jack Webb one show, and I wrote 11 of his next 22 shows. - I think it's just a matter of time, ma'am. We've got three teams of men working on it with us. STEPHEN: The police department reviewed the scripts so that the show portrayed the Los Angeles Police Department as the chief of police wanted it portrayed. - And we're doing everything we can. - I know. I know. STEPHEN: Dragnet was designed to show the police in their best light. As a matter of fact, Dragnet became famous as a recruitment tool. ["Dragnet Theme" playing] ANNOUNCER: Young men under 31 years of age for exciting, respected careers as officers with the Los Angeles Police Department. STEPHEN: As a matter of fact, Jack gave so much money to the Academy for every show that was made, and he based many of his decisions on what he thought the Chief of Police would want. - Are one of you fellows Sergeant Friday? - He is. - I'm Drew Heffman. My father said you wanted to see me. - Sit down, son. You didn't have to come in. A phone call would have worked. - It felt like reality to a white family sitting at home, watching their television. - Good morning, Joe, Bill. - Morning, Mary. - You're just in time for breakfast. - No, thanks, Mary. STEPHEN: But it didn't feel like reality to a Black family. - I just want you to know, Sergeant Friday, we're not gonna take this kind of treatment! - Out of a clear blue sky, these two cops turn red lights on us and pulled us over. STEPHEN: The idea of doing the show like that comes from the complaints in the Black community at the time. The Chief of Police said, "We need to answer this." - The red marks here show residential burglaries. - We're gonna explain the police perspective. CIVILIAN: Five red dots, right around our neighborhood. - Imagine, five burglaries in our neighborhood. - You've both cleared up a lot of things in my mind. The officers were doing everything right. STEPHEN: But you didn't get into the nitty gritty of what the real conflicts are between a community that feels occupied, rather than served, by their police officers. [dramatic music] In terms of the Dragnet show, you didn't get into situations where police officers used excessive force. You never saw the officers putting Black people on the curb, or up against the wall, or shaking down their cars without a warrant. But at the same time that show was being made, that kind of proactive policing was going on in Los Angeles. ELIZABETH: If you've been arrested unjustly by police or if you've been abused by police, your view of law enforcement is going to be very different than what is depicted in our popular culture on television shows. KHALIL: Black people were experiencing a sense of living in an occupied territory. Police were an occupying force as if you were a conquered people and the conquering army set up checkpoints and military posts in your community. And that any show of resistance to this experience of oppression could result in detention, arrest, or death. This created some of the groundswell of tension that would eventually lead to acts of racial violence. [crowd yelling in distance] ANNOUNCER: It was the most widespread, most destructive racial violence in American history. [sirens wailing] Negro leaders blamed it on a variety of social elements, but most of all, police brutality. - Hey! [yelling] - Push him down on the ground! REPORTER: It began with police and rioters clashing on a hot Wednesday night. But within a matter of hours, it was completely out of hand. STEPHEN: The Watts Riot demonstrated that you have a community that's left out... REPORTER: More than 1,500 people were in the streets, many hurling rocks and bottles at the police. STEPHEN: And feels that they don't have a say in how they freely travel in their community. They want protection. They just want it in a professional way. OFFICER: Get your hands up, I said. Drop that purse and get your hands up. OFFICER: Get them up. OFFICER: Get your hands up and go. - It's getting tired of being pushed around by you white people, that's all. REPORTER: How pushed around? How badly? In what way? OFFICER: Get him up. PERSON: In all kind of ways. Just stopping us on the street, kicking in the doors, taking down to police station and kicking your teeth in. - In almost every race riot in the 60s, of which there are a number-- '65 Watts, '67 all over the country, 200 cities-- all of these riots are caused, initially, by incidents of police brutality. - You see uprising after uprising after uprising. There is unchecked police violence happening to Black people and there is no mechanism for redress.

[disquieting music] ♪♪ ♪♪ After World War I, having sacrificed their lives to fight for freedom and democracy abroad, when Black veterans returned, they expected that that freedom and that democracy would also extend to Black people, and instead, these veterans and Black Americans in general, were met with mob violence. FATH: Often, the police are aiding the mob, and they are standing by, not doing anything, while the mob attacks Black homeowners, Black people walking down the street, men, women, and children. - Black people began to embrace the politics of self-defense and began to fight back. You now have a whole new group of Black people who have been trained in military methods and know how to shoot guns. - It was the fighting back that elicited the outrage of the white community and the participation of police officers often in disarming Black people from defending themselves and, in some cases, committed acts of direct violence towards Black people. - Police in these riots in Red Summer, all over the country, deputized the white population generally, which means they armed them, and they allowed them to rampage over Black property, Black people. - Deputization of white men by law enforcement officials underscores the extent to which law enforcement aided and abetted and facilitated the atrocities that occurred. FATH: When this is all done, when the houses are burned down, when thousands of Black people have been arrested, when some have been murdered, the police pull back and say no one is to blame but the Black people. ♪♪ ♪♪ TERRY ANNE: Violence against African Americans was not confined to the summer of 1919. That was just one moment on a historical continuum of this kind of violence that African Americans experienced in cities across the country. KHALIL: If we look at the total picture and what happened in these dozens of places, white police officers always picked a side, and that was on the side of the white community. - We were at the mall. It was pretty much a normal day. Then me and my friend were, like, kind of talking about something, and the kid came over and kind of started getting in our conversation. Then, when my friend said something about it, the other kid started going crazy. KID: We can go outside right now. Go right out there. Go right out there. - You're talking to an eighth grader.

He puts my hands behind my back and starts cuffing me while the other kid, not cuffed at all, just sitting on the couch, watching the whole thing happen. ONLOOKER 1: Why are you people so busy filming this? Z'KYE: I was pinned to the ground. They were using extra force. ONLOOKER 3: Oh, hell no. ONLOOKER 4: He getting arrested? ONLOOKER 1: Racially motivated. Z'KYE: I was scared because I didn't know what's going to happen next. I didn't know if it was gonna go any further. - Get up. JIHAD: I think it's a clear sign of racism. You have a kid who you presume is white and a kid who clearly is Black. These officers immediately walked up and assessed that the Black kid, who was underneath at the moment when they saw, was a threat. - The cops weren't there in enough time to analyze the situation of who's right, who's wrong, how it happened. But one boy was sat down on the couch. The other boy was being tackled, which is my son. Then the cop put his hands behind his back, cuffed him... JIHAD: While this other kid was sitting down on the couch, comfortable, able to stand up and walk away if he chose to. ♪♪ ♪♪ - What happened with the police made me, like, scared of them. I don't trust them as much. I think some of them abuse their power. - The other night, I was walking our dog, and I had a hoodie on because it was raining outside. And Kye was very nervous because it was a cop car that rolled past, and he's like, "Dad, can you please take your hood off?" Because that makes him nervous. This is not something we dealt with prior to this event. It hurts so much when you see your kid fall, scrape their knee, elbow, you know, because it's uncontrollable. It's going to happen. But in situations like these, it shouldn't happen. So I think the pain from that hurts in a different way because you know that just by the color of your skin, you're not safe.

So if I was with a group of white kids growing up in Atlanta, I would be read white. And I remember the first few times I would see the police and I was, like, checking in on-- how's everyone gonna react to this situation? And people were goofing around, joking, not playing it any mind. Like, it was just irrelevant to their existence. But if I was with a group of Black kids, if a police car rolled by, they would slow down. They would study, like, okay, what are they up to? And I could feel the anxiety level rise among my friends. This fear of what is about to happen and a kind of a defensiveness that starts to take over people's bodies. WATKINS: Police officers are not here for me.

[crowd cheering] [applause] MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, when will you be satisfied? We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is a victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. [cheering] SHARPTON: And Dr. King addressed police brutality. He was one of the first that would actually articulate that, put it into words. MARTIN LUTHER: No, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream. [crowd cheering] Dr. King purposely planned things like Birmingham, where they knew that if they marched children, their police would sic dogs on these kids. The camera took the veil off of the brutality that people were facing. So cameras played a vital role because Dr. King understood that if you can put it in people's face to see it, dramatize it, then it changes public opinion because it no longer now is an academic debate. I'm looking at Birmingham. All the way to I'm looking at you beat Rodney King. TONY: George Holliday's wife had bought him a video camera. He picked up the camera because he heard a commotion and he went out onto his balcony. The first thing George Holliday shot with his new video camera was the Rodney King beating. He called in to the LAPD and tried to get some response. "Hey, do you guys want to see the video?" Apparently not. So he calls KTLA, the station that he watches, and we said, "Sure. We'll take a look." ANNOUNCER: This is KTLA Channel Five, Tribune broadcasting in Los Angeles. - Dramatic videotape obtained by Channel 5 News shows what appears to be a group of LAPD officers beating a suspect. TONY: I said the best way for this story to be told is to run that tape in real time. And that's exactly what we did. That news story is the reason the Rodney King beating tape became the Rodney King beating tape. REPORTER: It began as a high speed chase, according to the California Highway Patrol, and ended early Sunday morning with the motorist, a Black male, being brutally beaten and kicked by Los Angeles police officers. AL: Here was a guy that was not even trying to defend himself and was being viciously beating by policemen, who should have been there to protect him from that kind of beating. They were the ones giving that kind of beating. JELANI: You saw images that much of Black America knew about. We had seen situations like this happen in our communities. Implicit within that was, "See? We told you." REPORTER: King suffered a fractured skull and other injuries from the beating. - I thought they were gonna kill me. That's what I thought. After they tied me up like that and handcuffed me, I thought I was gonna die. REPORTER: Political repercussions from the police brutality case in Los Angeles reached all the way to the White House today. - Sickening to see the beating that was rendered. And, uh, there's no way to-- there's no way in my view to, uh--to explain that away. It was outrageous. - Rodney King's beating was one of the first times that how Blacks were treated by police was in everybody's living room. America had to look at this. - Even if we determine that the officers were indeed out of line, it is an aberration. It is not the kind of conduct that, er, uh, we have normally from our officers.

REPORTER: Today, the head of the police officers' union said there was no chokehold and Garner would still be alive if he hadn't resisted arrest. ERIC GARNER: I can't breathe! I can't breathe! - The police officers and the EMS did what they're supposed to do at that time. If you're speaking, you can breathe. - Police federations often use the media as a weapon. - Mr. Garner made a choice that day to resist arrest. - They make victims out to be criminals. - Jamar Clark was not a peaceful, law-abiding citizen. NEKIMA: Jamar Clark was a young Black man who was standing at the back of an ambulance, checking on a friend. He was unarmed. He was shot in the head at point blank range by Minneapolis Police. ONLOOKER: They killed that boy in cold blood. Y'all know y'all killed him. - This event should have been a peaceful encounter. It was the actions and choices of Mr. Clark alone that determined its outcome. WILLIAM: It's very common for police unions to attack the victim or the victim's families. The implication is that they deserve what they got. BENJAMIN: This is the playbook, to assassinate the character of the person who is now lying on the ground, dead. George Floyd is a perfect example of that. - We saw the head of the police federation call George Floyd a criminal and to try to use that as a justification for what those officers did. GEORGE: I can't breathe, officer. - They never once said anything about Derek Chauvin keeping his knee on his neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds and George Floyd saying "I can't breathe" 28 times. They never ever put that as part of the narrative. CROWD: I can't breathe! I can't breathe! I can't breathe! I can't breathe! NEKIMA: But their narratives did not stand a chance against millions of people taking to the streets and demanding accountability. REPORTER: Protests against police brutality quickly spread to all 50 states and around the world. CROWD: [chanting in French] REPORTER: In Paris, they marched, as they did in Rome and Tokyo, in solidarity with what has become a worldwide movement. BENJAMIN: We saw this historical response. People saying we're better than this, America. Until we get justice, none of us can breathe. [chanting] Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Black lives matter! [soft music] ♪♪ ♪♪ - We hold two things together always at the same time. One, the police historically have never served the Black community the way they have served other communities. And at the same time, a hope that it will be different. NEKIMA: The entire system of policing in America needs to be overhauled. We need to determine, what is the purpose of police? - If we don't get no justice. CROWD: Then you don't get no peace. DERAY: When I talk about the police now, one of the things that I do is, I swap out "police" with "person with a gun." Do you need a person with a gun to get the cat out of a tree? Do you need the person with the gun to find the five-year-old that's missing? We call a person with the gun to do a whole lot that we probably could use other people for, right? 95% of what people call the police for is non-violent, or, like, not a violent crime. AL: I, in my life, has seen situations that are no different than my great-grandfather. Both of us got nervous when we saw the police coming. My great-grandfather was a slave. He had to worry about slave catchers. I'm not a slave, but I have to worry about every time a policeman pulls my car over. BENJAMIN: We are making progress, and we have to always remember that it's better to strike a match than to curse the darkness. ♪♪ ♪♪ When you're trying to change centuries of racist and bigoted policing, it's not gonna happen overnight. ♪♪ ♪♪ ANDRE: To ride around the city of Minneapolis and to see things that remind me of my son, it's tough not to get choked up. This pain is unbearable at times. KAREN: I think about Amir every day, all day. Amir should be here. There is no reason why my son should be in an urn right now, that I have to look at every day as a reminder. I feel like because of the color of his skin, he didn't have a chance. No mother should have to bury their child. ♪♪ ♪♪ He's not coming back. He's gone. ♪♪ ♪♪ ANDRE: The most important thing about Amir Rahkare Locke is that he was someone's son. He was my son.
