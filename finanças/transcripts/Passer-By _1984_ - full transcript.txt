Film Studio Ki presents Film by Andrzej Titkow PASSER-BY With Also With - Do you believe in man? - What a terrible question. So extremely exalted one does not know what to answer. If I say I do not believe in man and I would like to lock everyone up in concentration camp, it would not be good for art. An artist should say — I love people and I dream that all people can be happy. This is not a question for the first night performance. I don’t believe in man, man is a freebooter. Please, ask me a normal, European question. l was brought up in a cult of mankind, mm“? uniqueness as a phenomenon in the universe. When I saw terrible human misery, pettiness, wickedness I learned to be cautious. I am a pilgrim. I am coming back to my homeland from far. What does bring you here? - I came to right wrongs. - Did you hurt people? - l was hurt. - Who did it? Maybe you, maybe he, maybe they... People helped me a lot. I was lucky, I guess. Wherever I went, whenever I got anywhere, I owe it a great number of people. Some of them were well-known and famous, some were anonymous. Maybe in a certain way I should also be grateful to my censors. You may think What you Will but I have been through a lot. This isn’t anything new in this country. If I wrote it in a book, nobody would believe it. l governed people and built roads. l distributed houses and begged for bread. I shot at a man and was strangled With concertina Wire. All this shyness of mine, all my weird behaviour, all my fears stem from my... ...fear of ridiculousness. This particular fear probably has some deeper roots. Anyway, this element... I don’t have to tell all and reveal all. Look at the genius Who walked triumphantly through the World. He still moves himself and moves you although almost a century old. l have never wanted to become a professional writer or a professional film-maker. There is some vanity in it. I don’t write or collect letters, I don’t have a desk, fountain pens, a type-writer, I don’t have a technique, I don’t take notes... “you have just said something very interesting, please, let me take it down“. I could become a writer with some “inner warmth", I would write nice books full of humour and some tears. If they started to pay me, to support me, to pat me on the back, maybe I would achieve something in the field. Yet as the situation here was different, socialist reality, they pay the same for anything and the audience awards almost the same for anything. Are you writing anything? l have just started. What is this going to be? Nothing special. l have just had the idea to write some nonsense about myself. You have always written about yourself. To success. Your health. Shall we sign something? We would like to make you an offer. On behalf of our colleagues. What offer? We would like you to set yourself - on ﬁre in front of the building... - Why me?! Why do you come to me? It makes me wonder what happened to me. It seems to me that I haven’t changed at all. And yet there are some objective proofs that l have changed a lot. I may even be a completely different person. It is difficult to talk about it, a demagogue will immediately say “he wants to weasel out, he wants to excuse himself. He may want to say that he is not responsible for the errors of his younger years or his adult age. “ This isn’t true. It is an interesting phenomenon how far one can go in his life. I am a master of social intrigue. | always try to make people come together in a joyful way. I want for things to happen, I don’t want any boredom. When I stand in a queue and I turn into an old hag who will cook her dinner, and I know it all, what pasta, what... When I sit among bitter intellectuals I also become bitter. It seems to me that always try to behave in such a way as if I did not exist at all. As you know I am often taken for somebody else. And Who are you? l have scars on all my body. One by one, as if my skin was put on a barbecue. Maybe death would be better than this kind of life. Watch out. Not a word. If anything happens knock thrice. They won’t take me alive. Everyone has one special skill. A circus performer may do a triple twist somersault and this is his special skill. My special skill has been the ability to cast away any pose, any falsity immediately. I can wake up to reality in just a second and so I wake up. We are building a new house for our future, for better days, Warsaw, Help us With this task, share With us this task, we have a common aim, Warsaw, May the construction grows from its foundation to the roof, this our common dream, Warsaw... Once I had a great passion for travelling but I could not travel then. When I could travel I lost this passion. As a man gets older he feels the best in his own space. | feel the best in my room with my cat. The world gets smaller, from my point of view Manhattan or Long Island are a province of Oszmiana or Vilnius province. They are islands off the shore of this province. l was very much impressed by China. China expanded my knowledge of art, of man, of his existence on the Earth. l was so full of reverence for this country and then I took a local train from Vilnius to Kolonia Wilenska. I got out and I looked towards the Wilenka into the depth of the valley, and I thought that Kolonia Wilenska is the most beautiful. My writing is the best and easiest only when I lead my characters to places I remember from my childhood which I adapt in various ways to post-war, contemporary situations. Warsaw is probably the only exception. I finally got used to this city, it became the location for several of my novels. It seems to me that I am extremely sensitive. I can act like a medium in responding to national hysteria or social moods. I can feel the social temperature which is to say, I can tell exactly when this temperature is above or below the average, what is going on. I can feel something approaching, I know what it is going to be. Maybe it is so, that in Poland miracles happen when nobody wants them. They happen in other societies as well but they think about their miracles, they work for it to happen and it finally comes. In Poland it is always the other way round, miracles happen when nobody expects them. My childhood was full of sun, full of freedom. I would spend all days investigating every nook and cranny of my small world. I would come home late during the summer to find one of my relatives already waiting for me at the garden gate. When my father died my mother would lock me up and leave me at home and go to work. l was three and a half years old at that time. I remember that it took me many years to overcome this fear. I dream that there was just a chink in the window left for me. Naturally, when l was twelve to fifteen years old, love affairs were the most important. I fell for my school-mates who were all much taller. I remember how tiresome it was walking on my tiptoes to seem a little taller. When we went for a walk, six kilometres, it wasn’t either easy or nice to walk on tiptoes all the way. We all have something that bugs us... Every man climbs constantly upwards. Unless he degrades his social status. Going up is a natural tendency. Naturally, one may say that there are historic opportunities as well as social and political moments which make such climbing easier. I certainly used such a historic opportunity. War brought with it the fight but also joy. We wanted very much to join the guerrillas. We wanted to fight although we were not allowed in order to take our maturity exams. We simply ran away and joined the first guerrilla unit we could find during the Vilnius uprising. We survived the rising, we experienced the greatness and the misery of the action Storm... It did not succeed... My unit was one of the last ones to stay and fight. Just a few boys from city families. Brilliant, intelligent boys who did not fall into any trap. They survived until some girls scouts got them out of the forest, convinced them that it made sense to live on. There were still many people fighting for Poland they imagined during the war. I am talking about the resistance now. The resistance was still strong and until the very end some of them were quite desperate. Actually, I was one of them. | just managed to escape the forests a little earlier. The joy of life was stronger than any political fierceness. That was why the Home Army units left the forests and entered the civil life. Biology, pure vital force. Just as after a severe winter all the nature seems to explode uncontrollably life started to bloom madly on the ruins left by the war. Everyone wanted to experience life. I started to write shyly, slowly. In the beginning it was some journalism. Naturally, I wrote some six poems in my life. I tried writing reviews with Mach’s assistance. My Polish was closer to the language of Pushkin and Dostoyevsky at that time than to the language of Mickiewicz and Kochanowski. “Nurt” was just about to start. Borowski and Bratny were the editors, they came and said to me — we need some prose and we heard that you write prose. I wasn’t in the position to say “no“. I lived in Bristol Hotel at that time, l was transferred with the whole editorial board to Warsaw. l locked myself up and wrote the short story “Corporal Koziolek and Me".l think I did it during one weekend. Ididn’t eat, I didn’t drink, l sweated with fear, and I wrote my debut. I gave in to Marxism for the simplest reason. A reason which is obvious for my generation but for other generations is oddly incomprehensible. It was disappointment caused by the war my generation had lost. I joined the party, I got to like Marxism I had not known before and I never gotten to know. Maybe now I will look something up. I liked its rationalism. I could have become a dandy, slightly offended by reality but I fell to the very bottom with the party officials, with the “sinners“... I did not write to order. I wrote what I thought I should. I believed that once in a lifetime one can subjugate oneself, give up purely artistic ambitions for a cause. My losses included five failed or lame, or handicapped books. I became successful as a writer only when I told myself: “Never again! “ l welcomed 1956 with major reserve. From my point of view this catastrophe was not a simple backward somersault to be achieved in just a few hours. I did not change overnight. I had to digest it, remove the poison from my body. I could not pretend I was only naive. I had made a conscious decision, a painful decision which left its traces in my books. “Power“ for example, and all the doubts of an intellectual are all written down in my books. I did it as honestly as I could. I could not just stand up and say — well, I am sorry, I was wrong but now I am a different person. I felt cheated or rather as if I participated in a fraud. But you know already, I had said that I cannot find a few pages or a few takes that I would like to save from oblivion. Actually, I don’t know if I would like to save anything. I can hardly imagine that anyone will be interested in reading it some years after my death. | feel like a bankrupt Babylonian priest. During the Second World War all the old artistic canons were destroyed as if to take revenge on the self-assuredness of the old art, as if to punish its vanity, its contempt for simple people. Wonderful talentless hacks rule the world, their lack of talent is liberated and naked. We should give up any hopes that there are God given laws in the arts. Your noble artistic standards which you want to uphold are provincial and old-fashioned. Father, we live in days of great crisis. Forests die, rivers die, seas dry up. People fly to the moon. People crossed the threshold of the skies, they entered another world. There was terrible scream like in the tower of Babel. Thousands of slogans, thousands of catchy phrases. They all fly in the air and nobody knows what is what but as the smart alecks claim, nobody knows what is true because everyone has their own truth. However, when you corner a man he knows what is true and what is a lie. Complication is the mother of simplicity. What does it mean? It means only as much. We seek relief in our suffering, in our uncertainty, our fears, our hysteria. It is strange but art works as a cure even though it is a product of some illness itself. There are many things that I admire but I think that our only real achievement is art because art is a testimony to our presence. I reached the conclusion after numerous experiences that a man who writes should not be limited by any form of external discipline. He should listen only to his own conscience and write down his time as his old-fashioned soul dictates it. It is better for an artist not to be a member of anything. Exactly, this June 22 it was 58 years ago... and this is something of my personal boundary. Tell me exactly the date and hour of your birth. - Midnight, June 22. - I like this constellation. Cancer in opposition to Venus. This is not the best moment of my life. | feel a need for an internal change and in what I do. I want to write a short novel about supposed life of my grandmother about whom I know nothing, and about the birth of my father about whom I also know nothing. I did not have the time to ask about him when I still my relatives around me. Now that l have the time to ask them they are mostly dead. Maybe your mother told you Who my grandfather was? A Lithuanian peasant, a Russian soldier? A wandering Jewish merchant? My grandparents had a hard life. It was full of hard work, they worked a lot and had so few pleasures. Their greatest pleasure was prayer. I am thinking now that l have succeeded, l have gone further, I have flown further, lam thinking - am | happier then they were? I am not quite sure. As I say, all this I realise that this is my long, great, and very precisely prepared defence. I am defending what I have done, my gestures, fingers, my eye. I would like to save many things I did. Feelings, moods I described, fate of some generation that I managed to capture, some landscapes that existed and passed... I wanted something... I wanted something very important but I can’t remember any more. Maybe you wanted to leave behind a lasting shape of your life. There is something interesting in what I said, I am sorry I praised myself. Liar! He is a liar! Come on, why don’t you say something? A quite important function of art is helping our fellow creatures who also found themselves in this vale of tears. Our neighbours suffer the most because of solitude. This is the greatest scourge of our lives. I think that all loves, all friendships are born of this wild, extreme feeling of solitude. I want to be a passer-by, that a man meets in life. I want to wave at this man, give him a sign that there are other people in the world, that he is not alone.
