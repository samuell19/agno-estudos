Someone once told me... ...a long long time ago... ...immortality comes not without sacrifice. The fountain of youth. ...is fed by the blood of the young. And living forever leaves a trail of death. ...that haunts one's dreams... ...including mine. Temptation is the key. Vanity played in its strongest suit... ...lures those wanting more. Beyond the dream's smoky veil... ...nothing waits but teeth and blood. Born of all the wrongs. ...that transcend centuries... ...a beast walks. ...in the skin of man... waiting to cross over... ...to give us new life once more. Please come to me. - No! - Come to me. No! - Come to me. - No! For something lives. within that dream. Daughter or, like? - Hi, ladies. - Hello. Huh, orgy. - Love the dress. - Oh, thanks. Ohhh... who's that? I don't know, but he's... ...kind of sexy. - Yeah, in a Euro kind of way. - Yeah. I miss Euro. - Mm. - Sai, you're terrible. Yeah, well, I spent too long waiting. - For someone else to make the move. - I know. He's just slow on the uptake. I don't know what's taking him so long. I've given him the opportunity. - Hi, there. - Hi. Hi. Horrible art, isn't it? I wouldn't go that far. - Don't worry about it... - If you don't like it... ...you're supposed to say it's interesting. - I'm Eric. - Deanna. - Very nice to meet you, Deanna. - Pleasure's all mine. - Ladies. - Hey. - How's it going? - Hey, Jono. - Look who I found. - Hey, how are you? Your paintings are beautiful. Really. - Thank you. - Sai, darling... I have someone you need to meet. - Who? - He loves the derelict piece. Really? - We priced at $3,000. - What? - Shh. Come on, come on, come on. - What what? - Come on. - Kerra. Our resident genius. She is. How are you doing? How do you like the lofts? All right... They're enough for me, you know. I'm so proud of you. - Are you? - Yes. Without you, none of this could've happened. So thank you. I gotta go. Can you tell, uh, Sai... ...that the art show was wonderful? Yeah, man, no problem. Take care. Thank you very much. See you later. Do you have any idea how much you've grown? Sai, you're a star. - Oh, stop it. - Yes, you are. Stop it. Wait right here, I'll bring him back. Okay. Your use of dark, sensual imagery is a delight to the senses. There you are. Sai, darling... ...this is Mr. Renfield Lieb. Mr. Lieb's from Hamburg... Germany. Among other places. The pleasure is all mine. Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Lieb. Renfield, please. Renfield. Get to know one another. Sai, show Mr. Lieb "Phoenix. " Enjoy. You know what drives me insane? Let's have it. That the two of you have the perfect relationship. ...through the lens of that camera. What do you mean? Lmagine if you actually put the camera down. ...and stopped with the artist's incessant need. ...to pine for that which we cannot have... ...or don't deserve. You're hot, Royce. Smarten up. So tell me about this piece. Well... I paint from my dreams. In this one I was frozen into the earth... ...as natural metals infected my body. As far as I could see... ...trapped in the shell was... ...desolation; ...in the distance, burning alien cities. ...and the apocalyptic skies. I felt. ...a sense of peace... ...in the hopeless nature of it all. The infection was comforting. The metals became my skin and eventually. ...swallowed me whole. I'll take it. You really do capture the pleasure and corruption of spirit... ...the downward spiral. To fall into darkness is to be at peace with it. That's what it means to me: Transmutation. I couldn't agree more. Now he didn't... Oh, you're being beckoned. Oh my God, at the most inappropriate time. Hold on. Don't move. - I'll be right back. - Don't be long. - Okay. - Okay. Dude, I'm trying to get my rent paid. What? Who's the creepshow? So she digs the creepshow. Get over it, Royce. It's just Johnny Money. So... what brings you to LA? My fascination with urban decay. Then you've come to the right place. True human nature is in the rot of society... ...not in its achievements. How long are you in town for? Enough to get a taste. ...before I need to move on. Restless spirit? Incessantly. Are these your most recent pieces? No. I have a series of works at my loft. I could show you now if you like. It breathes in you, doesn't it? Lives in your heart. Delivers you from reality to a world. where all is possible. You feel so isolated. All of your pieces... ...it seems to me to be a reflection of your soul. Beyond everything you are... ...deep inside, you run lost in a world. where no one can find you. No one else sees it... ...for all they see is strength. No pain. No desperate sense of loss. I'm sorry. Don't be. You're the only one who's ever really got it. You deserve to delve. ...deep in the darkness of true passion. There is a well of untapped beauty you have yet to create. All around you is another world... ...that is channeled through you and your work. That, I also know. Can I share something with you? Something to inspire and tantalize your senses... ...to open the gates to your true possibilities. Okay. Will you trust me, Sai? I brought you here, didn't I? Good. A daring step to discover the true art inside you. What is it? It is called Strego-E... ...a very rare bark from Eastern Europe. Its sap gives vision to your true desires... ...shape to your hidden passions. It is very precious to me. Many great artists used it to create their masterpieces. The Nouveau movement: Mucha, Klimt... Beardsley especially used it... ...to open their minds. ...and create such wonders of altered reality. This gift I give to you. You've put me in a group of greats. I'm nowhere near them. I believe you're a kindred soul to them, Sai. You are just missing the thing that sets you free. I don't offer this to just anyone. This is as rare as the masterpiece. ...you seek in your heart to create. And what you bring out. ...into this world... ...is what I'm most interested in. Are you sure? Trust. Yes. What will it do? The effect on the mind is like a dream. What you imagine becomes reality. It will last only as long as you want it to last. I am here for you, Sai. If you become uncomfortable in any way... I will shake you free from its hold. Are you gonna do some with me? One goes in... ...one stays out. So... ...how do I do it? Fire purifies. Light it. And your senses will race elsewhere... ...to a world where life... ...is art. Inhale deeply. Royce? Royce? Come with me. Come with me. Royce here. Who? Yeah, headshots? Yeah, about 100 plus film. - Is she up yet? - Finally. Convince her to eat something, would ya? - I'll try. - Okay. So, yeah, why don't you give me a call on Tuesday. ...and let me know about what time is good for you? Okay. Me too. Bye. - Hey. - Hey, yourself. Hot date? Not unless I'm charging 150 bucks for it. I've seen stranger things. You've been working. Wow. - You like it? - Yeah. Yeah, it's not like your other stuff, but... ...it's got a real energy to it. It's amazing, Sai. You... Are covered. Let me shower quick. You want me to come back? No. Just keep your camera in the bag. Hey. Man, I hate the metro on weekends. - Did you order for me? - Yeah. Should be up in a minute. So which one was this? She works at Guitar Center. Discount for a deposit. You are such a waste of prime real estate. Wow. I think I'm going to take that as a compliment. And I think when I decide to get married... I'll marry you. - Yeah, right. - So where's Sai? Still with Johnny Money? No, she's painting. You should see it. It's unbelievable. She bang the old guy or what? - Eric. - What? Not everyone has your take on life. Well, they should. You know... ...there was a time when I actually thought. - That I was attracted to you. - Really? Like once upon a time? Shut up, Eric. So, Royce, can I ask you a question? Shoot. How come we stopped going out? - Out? - Yeah. On dates. Oh, that. - I don't know. - Oh, come on, Royce, just say it. I don't... I just... I thought we made better friends than... What, lovers? We were never lovers, Royce. Yeah, well... ...since we were such great friends... - I just didn't want to cross that line. - Oh! That dreaded line. You know you're destructive with kid gloves on, Royce? And that's a bad thing? No. But assumption is. Well, maybe I should've crossed that line. Maybe you should've crossed that line. Crack that bottle of wine open for us. It's over by my bed. Sure. Great. Hey, what's this? What's what? The box. I've never seen it before. It was a gift. From that guy? Yeah. That guy Renfield. You two really hit it off last night. He just opened my mind up... ...to new possibilities. That's all. Is that what the whole "line" thing is about? Well... ...how can we make a decision... without ever having the choice? God, come on, Kerra. I don't have the money, Eric. Jesus. You always take things so seriously. So big deal. You know I'm good for it. Come in. Come in. You're paying for the parking ticket, Eric. Enough already! That's as close as you're ever gonna get. Can we get him evicted? Not before he pays me back. This ass made me drive him to get more wine. Told me to park illegally and wait in the car. Then he called me from inside the liquor store. ...and asked me to come in and give him another three bucks. ...because he was short. So $88, Eric. How about I just sleep with you. ...and we'll just call it even, Kerra? Yeah. That'll work off the three bucks. I got the money. I'll get it to you tonight, I promise. I'd get that in writing. It'll hold more water. Skirtin' the lube, Sai. Just give it back. God, Eric. What do you use this for, sweetie? - What the hell is that? - All right, just chill out, okay? Look... ...you know writers and artists use absinthe. ...to inspire them to write and paint. Yeah yeah yeah, Green Faerie. Shut up, Eric. Well, this is just an elite form of that. Although, the name Renfield said, I'd... I'd never heard it before. So he got you high. ...and took advantage of you? Wow, yeah, total creepshow. So what do we do? We gotta chew on it. ...like some Apache tribe? No, moron. You smoke the sap. And you only need a little bit. It lasts as long as the effects run through your system. ...unless... ...somebody shakes you loose from it. Yeah, but is it safe? Yeah! I did it last night. I feel fantastic. There's no residual side effects. Other than that. - I'm in. Let's do it. - Sometimes I really worry about you. - You don't even know this guy. - Come on, come on, come on. Let's go. All right, bad boy. Looks like we got ourselves a safety campaign. - Are you prepared to dance? - Hit me. So what do I do? Inhale deeply. And enjoy. Are you gonna do it with me? One goes in... ...and the other stays out. - Are you ready? - Yeah. Eric! Eric! Eric! Eric! Eric! Come on, Eric! Get him off of me! Get off of her! What's your problem? I thought she was someone else. - This was intense. - Amazing, right? It was like being in some dark reality, you know? - Did you feel it? - That was so uncool. I told you, I thought she was someone else. Time to go, big guy. No amount of girl talk could stop that from happening. - What? - Kerra's been hot on Eric. ...since she moved in here. You've gotta be kidding me. You're so oblivious to subtle advances. Subtle? Yeah. Oblivious. God. Yeah? Hey. Hey. You owe me $88. Uh, yeah, right. I'm serious, Eric. I need the cash. Okay, this is gonna... this is gonna take a minute. I need to look through about five pairs of jeans. Does Sai know you have that? No. - You want to try it? - No. Really? I just want the money. Kerra, look. I care about you a lot. Eric, don't do this. No, I... I want to. I'm really not good at saying how I feel. I just... Kerra, I think you're amazing. I really do. I think you're beautiful. Just... ...just come here, okay? Come here. What was it like? It was like excellent "X." I want to try it. - Yeah? - Yeah. I want to try it. Okay. All right. Let's wait. You want to do it first? Okay. All right. Am I gonna be okay? Trust me. Kerra. Eric. C'mere. It's okay. C'mere. - Don't. - It's okay. I'm scared. I want to go home. Wake me up. Just let go. I don't wanna! No! Kerra. Wake me up! No no. Please God! Wake me up! Wake me up! Wake me up! Wake me up! No! No! Wake me up! Wake me up! Wake me up! Wake me up! Wake me up! Kerra? Come on. No! Kerra. - Wake me up! - Kerra! Kerra! Eric! What the hell? - Kerra. - Let me go! What did you do to her? Snap out of it! We gotta call 911. - No! - She'll be okay. Not gonna call 911. It's gonna be my third strike. - We gotta call 911 now! - Dude, you don't know. Listen to Sai, she's gonna be fine. Wake up! It's Royce. - Leave me alone! Leave me alone! - Calm down, calm down! It's Royce! It's Royce. Look at me. Focus. Focus! It's Royce. Focus. Calm down. Calm down. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. What did you give her? Calm down. It's okay. I have to go. I have to go. Did you give her some of that stuff? Asshole. Where is it? I don't know. Kerra. Where did you get it? I got some on my own. You have no idea what you're messing with. I'll take my chances, Sai. Sai? - Kerra. - Go away! Go away! Please. This isn't happening. This isn't happening. Get away. Please go away! Please go away! Go away! I'm sorry. Something's pulling us together. Something I can't deny even to myself. But here, it's so easy. It's just us. And what lies between us. I can be here if you let me. Forever yours... ...if you let me inside. Open yourself to me, Sai... ...and everything will fall into place. I love the way you look at me. Come with me. Sai. Yes. Yeah, if I can get those prints for today... ...that'd be great. Yeah, some theater. Yeah, in Long Beach. I just shot it today. Look, I'm just getting in. Can I call you back? Cool. Thanks. Kerra, it's Royce. Kerra, I just want to see if you're all right. Royce... Eric? Are we not friends, Eric? Come in. Hey. Hey, you. Hey, you haven't talked to Kerra, have you? Why? Because she's not picking up her phone. ...nor is she answering the door. Plus Eric is acting totally weird. Probably the guilt of what he did is eating him up inside. I'm sure Kerra will be fine. She just needs some space. Hey. Look familiar? Should it? In essence. You're what I see when I enter the dream. What dream? All I see is you. Like what you see when you look through the lens. Do you have any film left? Yeah. Why? 'Cause I want you to photograph me. I want to see what you see... when I'm somewhere else... ...seeing you. Pull it out. Sai, I'm a little concerned about you doing that stuff. I've never seen you deny the chance. ...to take a photograph of me, Royce. So how much are you doing of that stuff? Just enough to get what I need. I'm in control, Royce. Trust me. Or maybe you just need to see for yourself. Come on, baby. Sai, Sai! Jesus, come on, Sai. You gotta stop doing that stuff. Sai. Oh, Sai. I'm not gonna sit around watch you destroy yourself. You have no idea. What are you talking about? You have no idea what this drug is doing to you. I mean, look at yourself. Look at your neck. Oh my God. It's poisoning you. It's sucking the life right out of you. I love you too much to stand by and watch you do this. What? What? What did you say? Did you mean it? Did you mean what you said? Did you? Yes. Yes, I did. Please. Please. Stay with me. I won't... I won't do it again. Trust me. Just stay with me. Come to me. Sai... Sai... ...answer me. Vampyre... Oh, Sai, you're mine. You're Vampyre. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Sai? Don't go. Are you feeling any better? Much better. Don't you think we should think this through? You... ...think too much. Hey, baby, it's Royce. I tried to wake you, but you were... well, I had to run some errands. Have you heard from Kerra? I'm a little worried about her. And you. But we can... we can talk about that later. I'll see you soon. Bye. You remind me so much of her. From first sight... I knew you'd renew me again. I'm so sorry for what I've done to you. I've misled you... ...like so many others before... ...stretching past the limits of my memory. But... ...blood is life. And you are near to giving me what I need. Trust me, it's going to be a riot. Uh, Eric... Eric, I need to get back to the Guitar Center before midnight. ...for inventory or my boss will kill me. - It's gonna be okay. Okay? - You promise? Very near. We are so close. You know what to do. Sai? Sai, you in here? Sai? How'd you get in here? Shouldn't you be asking why? Sai, are you okay? Never better. I can feel... ...how much you want me... ...pulsing... ...through your veins. I want you just. ...as much. I see you in my dreams. You're so... You're so sweet. Eric, help me, please! - It's okay. - No. It's okay. What the hell is going on here? Are you here to feed our lust? Or are you just feed for us? It was meant for you... ...not to be shared. Now you will suffer... ...by losing him. No! Oh my God. Fuck. That's the spirit. What a nice looking young man. What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? Please tell me. Eric. Eric. Wake up. Wake up! Wake up! Who is it? - Royce? - What did you do? - What did you do? - I made a mess of things. It's Sai. - What? - It's Sai. What about her? - She's the bait, man. - What? What do you mean? - Royce, it's... - What? It's Johnny Money. Time to bring him in, Sai. I don't think I can. Don't be afraid to love forever. Enough for two. No. Okay okay. You're coming with. - Grab me, grab me. - Okay. Take him with you, Sai. Oh, God, come on. No. I won't. Sai! Take him with you. Sai, it's Royce! Open the door! Sai, come on, open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Come on, baby! Open the door! - Wait for him, Sai. - It's Royce! - Come on! - Wait for him. - Come on! Come on! - Wait, Sai. Do not defy me! No! Open the door! Open the door! Come on, Sai! Come on! Royce. Take my hand. - I'm not leaving. - Go! No. - I'm not leaving you. - Go! Leave me. - Get out of here. - I won't. Sai... - Royce. - You son of a bitch. She's waiting for you, Royce. I should kill you right now. Yes, you should. But what then? She did it for you, Royce. - No. - She wants you to join her. No. Trust me. Trust? Come to me. Do you hear her, Royce? I need you. Royce, don't go. Save me. Go to her, Royce. You won't come back, Royce. She needs you. Look at me, Royce. You won't come back, Royce. Come to me. Go to her. Wake me. A greater scheme unfolds before me. Sai? It's me. Sai, it's Royce. Sai, please. Sai, please come with me. Will you come back with me? I can't help myself. For me, a new beginning... ...years gained from those lost... ...their blood for my extended life... ...drained from a beast not meant for this mortal coil... ...and my words wasted on the dumbest of ears. All right, Shakespeare. You're dead. Royce. Royce! Sai? You need to get out of here, Royce. You need to snap out of this for me, Sai. I want you... ...so bad. I'm not gonna leave you like this, Sai. Please. Come with me. Please. I know what he wants. I'm part of him now. You're part of me. Royce, you gotta get up. Royce, I need you to get up. Just wake up. Hello, old friend. Help me! I'll help you live forever. Stay with me. Stay with me. It's okay. Let me help you. Royce... Please... I need. ...to free my soul. Sai... Sai... Sai... - Say it. - No. I need to hear it. ...one last time. Say it. Please, Sai. Tell me. Tell me. Please. I love you. Oh, God. No! So are where you headed? On the road. Wherever it takes me. He's still here. Dude, I'm gone. Take care. Come to me.
