need your sermons I can't let you have any more safe I hate you what it God bringing into this rotten world anyway Cecil you need some help I can walk a few black so that's the story in my life next day last night really that's when I stole the booze with Jill and brought it home to Jean and you think that was hope for me ten years ago Oh ten years ago man there's hope for you now oh no not for me Cecil oh I don't I don't want to hear that don't you believe this is the Word of God yeah I believe it's the Word of God I used to read it during the war when I was afraid I was gonna get shot up by the Japanese but I didn't understand so I gave it up what's a slit listen the Bible says then the natural man receiveth not that things have called early let me read you from the 3rd chapter the Gospel John word says there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews now Nicodemus was a Pharisee he was a religious man but it didn't know God then Jesus goes on and says verily verily I say unto you except you be born again you cannot see the kingdom of God printer time I don't understand what you're reading listen say so let me paraphrase this oh cool God's love Cecil Moe that He gave His only begotten Son no no no not me he doesn't love me why do you say that Cecil if he loved me so much then why did he take away my mom and my dad and now my wife and kids see so jesus loves you Christ died for you he shed his blood for you he wants you to repent he wants you to call upon him and he want you to say Lord I'm a sinner well what do I have to do repent your sins and ask him to come into your heart and be your Savior would you like to kneel here right now this does pray and ask God if I do that is it gonna bring back my the kids see so I can't promise you that is it gonna bring back my business I can't even promise you that what can you promise I can promise you to repent your sins and call upon him he'll give a eternal life and he'll delivery from alcohol and he'll make a man a tea for good for him oh how I like to be a man again to look in the mirror and shave not want to cut my throat it sounds too good to be true what what if I do this whatever is you say repent of your sins and call upon Jesus as Lord and Savior would you like to do that right now a season ago I trust Christ and what if I still can't stop drinking what time Cecil if you really repent your sins and trust Christ as Savior and he doesn't change your life and deliver you I'll fill that Bible II and I'll never pick another sermon as long as I live you mean that I mean it absolutely I want to trust Christ right now Tom yes dear lord have mercy I need a sinner i I can't begin to tell you how sorry I am for all the wrong and I've done been a thief and a drunk and a liar and a bomb for so long I need you in my life now though it's so bad my kids and my wife they were all suffering so much it they've been so good and I've been so bad I don't know just ask him Cecil to come into your heart and be your safe dear Jesus please come into my heart and make me a new man please Jesus amen I don't understand everything seems so beautiful you know a say so the Bible said therefore if any man be in Christ he's a new creature old things pass away behold all things become as new Thank You preacher god bless you say so but you let a drunk stranger come in your house at 4 o'clock in the morning go upstairs and see mommy okay tell her I'll be home later have a nice day Lily you too don't work too hard I'll try not to what you again raise your phone hello Jean I'm real hungry if I come home you fix me some breakfast things will be different now last night oh please Jean come out I'm broke I haven't got a dime you just let me come home and eat how do you why no no you can't talk to me I don't want to talk to you something very special I don't care what if I said I was gonna stop drinking I'd say that you were a stinkin liar you have every right to say that god save me last night I went to see a reverend he showed me in the Bible where God forgave me my sins I've changed why I haven't I've accepted Jesus Christ as the Lord in my life I believe he died on the cross for me I believe when he rose from the dead gave me a chance for a new life I'm a changed man Jean I must be out of my mind somehow I believe you you good morning everybody I got an announcement to make your dad's become a Christian what a Christian daddy the question is somebody who trusts Jesus Christ and last night I decided to do that it means with God's help I won't be drinking anymore well let's do something we've never done before let's pray dear lord thank you for helping me find Jesus and help others who need to find him be able to have the same experience that I did amen amen I know you guys don't trust me but you're gonna see a change in your own bed I'm going downtown later and pick up a Bible and I'm gonna get a haircut - come on five bucks Jeanne come on Jane we're gonna

matter I don't know if I can take another one of these sermons on being born again so this morning dear friends we've come to the realization that God presents two roads to every man and everyone has to make his choice as to the road that he will take the one road leads to destruction it's the broad in the popular road the other is the narrow road that leads to a life and we read few there be that find it would to God that you would find that road this morning may we pray together Almighty and eternal God our Father we pray that thou it's lead that person who is on the border of turning his
