Polecat! Valerie... forgive me. Where are her earrings? - Speak! - I lost them, Constable. You're lying, Eaglet. You won 't escape punishment. I'll put you to the water torture! Eaglet! Bend over so I can jump on your back. Hurry up... ...you brat. Grandma, the actors have arrived. You should be more interested in the missionaries arriving. When? Today or tomorrow. One of them will stay with us. Are you playing with your earring, child? I'm not a child anymore. In fact, just last night... At the age of 13... ...just like your mother. I'm warning you. Get rid of those earrings. Your mother put them away the day she entered the convent. Your father was the bishop. As you know, they're both in heaven now. Is there some secret in these earrings? Oh, no. I got them at the auction of this house.. ...from a certain Constable. You knew him? Grandma, it's the actors! No, that's a wedding. Hedvika's getting married. Kyrie eleison. Lord, have mercy on her. Deliver her from thy wrath... Poor Hedvika. Why? She'll be a rich landowner's wife now. Grandma! A monster! It can't be him. He's dead, after all. Who are you talking about, Grandma? Go practice your scales. Yes, Grandma. “Beautiful maiden... ...it was I who stole your earrings... ...and then returned them into your hands. My uncle, the Constable, longs to seize them. He killed my father and mother,... ...and now I fear for your fate. In church today... In church today there will be a sermon for young maidens. Please leave a dress of yours for me in the arbor... ...that I might disguise myself and speak to you in church. Your poor Eaglet.” Valerie! Where are you, child? lt's time to dress for church. Grandma, may I bring a sprig of rosemary? I, a servant of the Lord... ...and a missionary... ...have come among you today, dear maidens... ...for your instruction and edification. O virginal maiden... ...do you know what you are? You're an alabaster hand proffered in greeting. You're a pomegranate yet to be split open. You're a boat-shaped leaf,... ...an opening rosebud. The callous hand... ...that would touch your breast... ...would leave an indelible imprint. But I am here with you, my maiden. In place of your guardian angel,... ...I bend down to you... ...and with the most exquisite ointment... ...I bless your lips, your breasts... ...your loins. Eaglet. Eaglet. Valerie... ...is it really you? That monster tortured me. Valerie, I want to give you some advice. - We're in the town square. - Forgive me. Hide your eyes. Now? NOW! Here I am. First of all... Where is the parish poorhouse, dear child? Over there, Father. You're performing an act of mercy. Or perhaps you mind taking me there? Not at all, Father. In God's name, I beg of you! You go in first. Go on. Don't be afraid. Welcome. This is my kingdom. Valerie... ...come closer. Closer. Come and you will see. Look. No! I know that you love me no longer, my Gracián. Just five years ago, when you were last here... ...but now! Away with you! I'll whip myself! Grandma! Keep watching. This is only a dream. I'm asleep... ...and all this is a dream. Did he hurt you? No. He wants you to love him. How can I love him when I'm afraid of him? That's exactly why. Eaglet! I'm waiting for you, Constable. Damned meddler! Hands up or I'll shoot, thief! Elsa... ...it's me. Do you not recognize me? Richard! It's been so long since anyone called me... ...by that name. Why have you come, Richard? I missed you. Since the day you seduced and abandoned me... ...I've never loved another man. How sad. How old you are now, Elsa! You were 17 back then. What I'd give to become young again like you! Richard... ...tell me your secret. I'll give you anything you want! Give me back this house. That would be robbing Valerie. You're ready to commit far worse acts. I'll do anything you say. Good. Let's draw up a little contract. You will be young and beautiful again. It will happen tonight,... ...at that miserly landowner's wedding. You're the devil! This pearl will save you. Eaglet, where's Valerie? - I carried her off. - To where? The church tower. Come here, you fool! You will take me there too! Let us pray. Hear that? Three times now the bells have begun ringing and then gone silent. This is excellent. Hardship always leaves one with an appetite,... ...and I experienced a good many things... ...on my mission among the cannibals. We saved a young black woman. She was very beautiful. What became of her, Father? We took her to our tent... ...and converted her to our faith. She showed great talent. Did she become a nun? No, unfortunately. We lost her in a French port. Marta, where's the wine? One day I'll tell you what became of her. She fell into immoral ways... ...and sinned against the sixth commandment. I'll give you a talk on the subject, dear child. Thank you, Father. Your father, the bishop, was a refined and sensitive man. He'd faint when the prostitutes came to confession,... ...and all the beautiful women adored him. I'll tell you more some other time. How many children did he have? He had you... ...and a boy named Eaglet. Eaglet? What is it? I have a headache. May I go lie down? - Dinner's not over yet. - Forgive me. Will you toast with us? I've never had wine. Today will be an exception. In memory of the late bishop. Eaglet! I've come to speak with you, dear child. Now, Father? There is no better time for contemplation. What beautiful breasts you have! Please go away, Father! What I desire from you is sweet. You're so lovely. - You're magnificent. - Go away! You're ravishing! I'll fight you off, you coward! My death will be on your conscience. What have you done? The fowl plague! The fowl plague is here! It is done. My house is yours again. And now we will wait until midnight... ...by the conjugal bed. Come. It is time. All my dreams have come to nothing. Come. It is time. I am old. I shall grow old too. - Do you love me? - Yes. Not a drop of blood. Don't cry. You look old when you cry. Eaglet! Here. - Don't look at me like that. - Like what? Kneel down. Kneel down! - Is it too cold? - No. I'm like a blind man. There's an empty guest room at our house. You can rest there. That bastard threw me down from the tower. The clapper of the bell saved me. I heard it toll very oddly. I prayed for you. The plague is our best friend. Without enough fresh blood, my uncle the Constable... - ...will die like an animal. - You're so cruel! He's been ripe for death for a hundred years,... ...the monster. It's nothing. Just a man hanging from the window. Where are we? Still right under your house. I'm afraid. Be brave. Who's inside these coffins? Victims of the Polecat, their veins sucked dry. Look. Grandma! Forgive me. I wasn't suitably dressed. This is your room. I thought this room was empty. I arrived on the night coach. Don't you recognize me? I'm a distant cousin. Call me Elsa. Valerie. And this is... my brother. Eaglet. I've taken your room... ...it would seem. You're welcome to it. No, I couldn't. You'll find me another, won't you? I'll ask Grandma. Your grandma has gone away, dear child. Without saying good-bye? Old people have their odd whims. But I'm sure you'll allow me to stay in her quarters. With pleasure. This room is yours, then. Here you are. I'd love to go for a horse ride. I'll lend you my horse. I'm very tired. I'm going to lie down. You really don't recognize me? No. You're not afraid of me, are you? But these are silly questions, my dear... ...since we only just met. My earrings! Your sister still hasn't returned? Where's Valerie? You must know. You're adorable when you're angry. Where's Valerie? I'll tell you on one condition. You must make love to me. Never! Leave this room. No. I'm not your guest here. You leave! You'll regret this. You will die a glorious death! Die, Valerie! Die! Eaglet! Good night, my dark-haired girl Good night and sweet dreams When you wake My love Do not reveal your secret Valerie, you're saved. I heard everything. My cousin's in love with you. - Your cousin? - I know. She is Grandma. She stole my earrings. But they were empty. Here lies their secret. They'll protect you from mortal danger. Beware of the Polecat. Where is he? - He's dying. - Poor thing. He's bewitched you. Valerie... ...I love you. No, you mustn't! We're brother and sister! - The bishop was our father. - That's not true! Come back! Valerie! The Polecat is my father! I will, I will not... I will! I'm dying! I'm dying! Now you know what it's like to be old. You're wasting your breath. Valerie's dying. I sacrificed her for my youth. You're doomed just like me. You'll suffer the same convulsions. Only your granddaughter could have saved us both,... ...because she has my blood. How could that be? Her father was the bishop. I was the bishop! I'm Valerie's father! You're lying. Something to drink! No! First tell me how to prolong my youth. Save Valerie. In her blood lies our salvation. Valerie. Cursed Valerie! It's me... Father. My child. Here. No, it's too disgusting! I'm just a man again,... ...and I must die. No, you won't die. You saved me. Father! - Let me go! - I'm a monster again! Let me go! Leave me alone! No! Gracián! My Gracián! Your lover is sleeping like a log. Gracián. Poor Gracián. I have a plan, Elsa. I need Eaglet's heart. You mean to kill Eaglet? His heart will revive my daughter and give her eternal youth. Richard, transplant Eaglet's heart into my breast. You're betraying Valerie. Richard, you'll do as I say. With a bleeding heart. Eaglet... ...why did I abandon you? Help! Why do you haunt me, Valerie? Don't be afraid. I'm not dead, and neither are you. Come. I'll lead you out of here. The rectory is across the way, Father. You tempted me to sin, wicked girl! You will get your due. “Valerie... this is good-bye. You abandoned me, and that monster defiled your lips. We could have been so happy together. Trust me, Valerie... ...the Polecat is neither your father nor mine. You've prolonged his life. I wanted to be your protector, friend, and husband, but it's too late. Farewell, Valerie. Your Eaglet. ” Valerie, what's wrong? Come. Hedvika! Hedvika. What's wrong? I've been wasting away since my wedding day. - You must eat hearty soups. - No. I'm in a vampire's power. Valerie... ...look at my shoulder. Does it hurt? No. - You notice anything about my lips? - No. Why? Aren't they stained? You've been eating berries. When you're with me, I'm not afraid of anything. I'm so happy- I've never had a close girlfriend. Valerie, I'm saved! Look. The marks are gone. Your kisses have restored my health. You're so beautiful. There's a witch living among you. She tormented me with her sinful words. She pressed her fawning hips against me. When she saw that I could bravely resist her temptations,... ...she threw a noose around my neck. I thank God that I escaped safe and sound. But that witch... ...is now hiding among you! Hand her over! She must burn at the stake! That's a lie! Don't believe him! There's the witch now! Don't believe him! I swear he's lying! Begone, Satan! Seize her! To the stake with her! Confess that you're a witch! Liar! Pyromaniac! Repent! Hairy-faced clown! Eaglet, why hast thou forsaken me? Here she is! She's lovely! Our masters, back from their travels,... ...will give us their hands and feet. They will rest their heads,... ...and we will kiss them. Come here, you trollops! You ever had a good thrashing? Beast! Drink deeply, Richard. He's gone! The Polecat! May the power of these spells be broken. Good night, my dark-haired girl Good night and sweet dreams When you wake, my love Do not reveal your secret Grandma! Where were you? Where do you think, child? I was at church. Have the missionaries gone? What missionaries? What's the matter, my child? Nothing, Grandma. Grandma? There's a strange man outside. That's just one of the actors wandering around the town. My dearest... ...do not go to the theater. Instead... ...have the horses hitched up at once... ...and drive to the Blue Lake. Don't shoot, for God's sake! No! Miss! Your grandma is dying! Grandma! Dearest Grandma, what is it? Grandma. The mirror. A coach with no coachman has left the courtyard. That's a good sign. I've never had the courage to tell you the truth. Your mother loved a certain young gamekeeper. She gave him two children,... ...a boy and a girl. But Richard, my lover, told me the children were his,... ...and out of jealousy... ...I drove your mother from this house. I kept the little girl. You are that girl. Richard took Eaglet away to some unknown place. I drove your mother out with the words... “I'll take you back... ...when the horses bring you back on their own.” Then my mother's still alive? Grandma! Mother! My child. This is your father, my dear. I've seen your face somewhere before, Father. An early childhood memory, no doubt. Is all this but a dream? If only your grandmother would forgive me. Good night, my wizard Hear your fairy, how she cries Hear her cry so hopelessly The night weaves a cloak of grief for her Good night, my dark-haired girl Good night And sweet dreams When you wake, my love Do not reveal your secret THE END
