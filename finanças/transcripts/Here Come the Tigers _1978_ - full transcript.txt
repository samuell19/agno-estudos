[classical music] [classical music] [classical music] [wind whistling] [chanting] [siren] [horn honking] [sirens] [murmurs] [chanting] [murmurs] [man] It's Kreeger. Hey, Kreeger! Think of your family. Come on down, man. [chanting] Chief, what happened? Is that Sergeant Kreeger up there? Oh, he says he's a Cleveland Indian and he's going to jump. Best damn man on the force for 30 years and now I gotta friggin' sitting bull who needs a rubber teepee. Let me see what I can do, all right? Oh, okay but I got public works sending over a cherry picker to get him down if you can't. [chanting] Sergeant Kreeger. Hey, Kreeger. That's near enough. Stop right there, white man. It's me. I'm Eddie Burke. Oh, hi, Burke. Fine mess I got myself into, isn't it? [chanting] What happened, Sarge? I don't know. It just came over me. One minute, I was booking this turkey for making an illegal left turn, the next minute I was Chief right in the ass. [chanting] That's far enough. Come on down, Sarge. Put your uniform back on. Can't. Why not? I'm nuts. They got guys down there who can cure you. I don't wanna be cured, I wanna be a Cleveland Indian. [chanting] Did you know that Bob Fowler pitched 350 strikeouts in 1947? It was 348 in 1946, Sarge, now come on down. See, I can't even remember the numbers anymore. I'm gonna jump. Wait! Wait, wait. Don't jump now. No! Wait, wait. What about your kids? What about the baseball team? I've lost all my good players. What? My team, The Tigers. I lost all my good players from last year. I had my first practice yesterday. [chanting] Come on down, Sarge, The Tigers needs you. The league'll have to find somebody else for those pea brain losers. No, no, think of, think of those kids. You, you can't let those little kids down. Come on down, Sarge. [siren] You're right. We can't let the kids down. You coach my Tigers. Sarge, I can't. You know your stuff. You played high school ball. I remember you. You'll do great. You coach and I won't kill myself. Okay. I'll coach The Tigers one season. And then my wife will divorce me. [chanting] [metalic door slam] Kyle, Ziggy, take care. So long, we'll see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow, Richie. [man] Richie, how you doing? Burt, you get those hot sheets? Yeah. Oh, and I got the 1030's straight. Hiya, Coach. How you doing, Kyle? Sergeant Kreeger was crazy like a fox, man. Yeah, what would you have done? You ain't seen The Tigers yet. Word says your team couldn't even get itself kidnapped. Hey, no sweat. My partner here will have them whipped into shape just like that. Yeah, I got a buddy that saw the lineup. And I got five big ones that says you guys don't do no better than second division. I'll take that bet. [Kyle] You're on.Burt, Burt, no, no. It's only 5 bucks. Wait, wait, wait, wait. 5 big ones is 500 bucks. I'm willing to cancel it, Burt. Oh, no, no. Burt Honneger is a man of honor. Holy shit. You think you got a chance? I don't know. I haven't even seen the talent yet. I mean, I played all city third base my junior year in college. I never coached anybody in my life. Cancel the bet, Burt. Hm-mm. But, I'd better give you a helping hand. That's so my money's got a running chance. Did you ever play ball? Fifth grade. Went out for catcher. Oh, but I got beat out by Dale Bueller. He really must've been good. Dale was a girl. The Panthers will wipe the league six ways from Sunday. They got two pitchers with ERAs with 2.12. What's an ERA? It's, uh, just like an APB. Beginning to think I should've let Sergeant Kreeger kill himself. [kids shouting] Timmy Deutsch, stop that or I'll rat on you. That too, oh, boy! All right, come on. Come on, throw it. [soft music] Ah, kids. Kids, I'm Eddie Burke, your new coach. Another flatfoot. [kids laughing] [kid] Officer Burke.Yeah, yeah, what's your name, kid? It's Eaglescout Terwilliger. Yeah? Well, who are you? Fritz Curtis. That's The Bionic Mouth. Well, what can I do for you, uh, Eaglescout? Before you arrived, Timmy Deutsch over there, was choking the little kids.I was not. Liar.Shut up. Bullies are so insecure. How old are you?Ten. You wanna live to be 11? Shut up! Hold it, hold it, hold it. Fart speaks.I hear you coacher. Now, I thought you kids wanted to play baseball. Who do I talk to to get a transfer out of this chicken outfit? Are we gonna have tryouts for all the positions? That's the only fair way. That way nobody's gonna get screwed. You'll get screwed, you little flea.Cram it, Deutsch! Hey, hold it! [chatter] [fart] Get out of my face. Aw, who cut it? Ew. Disgusting. Who the hell's that? That's my assistant coach. [funny music] [kid] If that's your assistant coach, I think we're in big trouble. All right, kids, let's hit the field. [kids shouting] Hey, hey! Spread it out, spread it out. Do we have to do this? He's gonna eat a booger. [kids] Ew! What's your name?Roger. Here you go, Roger. No, no, no, your nose, Roger. Hey, what's your name? Noel Cady. We call him Peanuts. He's our mascot.Shove it, Mike. Hold, hold, hold, hold it, hold it. Hold it, hold it. Okay, okay, okay, okay. [funny music] [kids laughing] Now, look. One of the things that we used to do that was important was, we'd check the wind direction. That's the first thing you do so you don't get fooled by a high fly ball, you know? You take some-- take some grass just like this and you throw it up in the air. And that way you can see which way the ball's gonna go. Everybody do that, come on. [kid] North by northwest. That's southwest, you geek. [chatter] There goes my 500 bucks. [funny music] Put it this way, Burt. I could wind up the season as everybody's favorite bad guy. So, if I spend the time and make The Tigers win, my wife will kill me. And, if I don't, and they lose, you lose your 500 bucks, the kids hate me and The Chief will blame me for reflecting badly on the Force. So, if I win, I lose nd if I lose, I lose. Don't worry, I got a book on baseball. I'm gonna be a great assistant coach. Ah. A runner acquires the right to an unoccupied base when he touches it before he's out. Burt, put the book away, you're making me nervous. [woman on radio] Bravo 10, we have a report from a lady claims the dog's going to the bathroom all over her lawn. And it isn't her dog. 10-4. Why don't they call a dog pound? Damned if I know. So, what's a squeeze play? A squeeze play is what I'm gonna do to your head if you don't stop talking about baseball. That's not a squeeze play. [chatter] [man] At ease, at ease, men. Before you start your tours, I just wanna clue you on the vandal operating on the west side. The MO's very close to the one used a year ago by Francis Xavier Rivera. Not Ball Buster Rivera? That's him. Age 11. Height 4 ft 10. Weight 85 or 86 lb. Hispanic. He did two bits at the correctional facility at Pennsburg. And spent most of last year at juvie. What's his thing, Chief? He hates cars. Yesterday, he vandalized six Granadas and a couple of Montegos. Shrink says he hates them because they're bigger than he is. Now, men, be on the lookout for a ball buster before he does anymore damage. That's all, men. [horn honking] [horn honking] [engine accelerating] [tires squealing] Hey! What the hell? Can't you watch where you're going? You watch it, lady. Aw, you pretty, chauvinist pig. Damn fool! [funny music] [funny music] [funny music] [funny music] [door closing] [engine accelerating] Watch it, you--! [engine accelerating] [tires squealing] [suspense music] [crashing noises] [triumphal music] [suspense music] [siren] Stop, Buster Rivera! [funny music] [cars alarms] [funny music] [funny music] [fart] [dog barking] [funny music] All right, all right. Hold it, hold it, hold it. Easy. Police brutality! Get off my ass, you blue balled faggots. Easy does it, easy does it. Easy, easy. Hands off the threads, sucker. You rip this shirt, you buy me a new on. Are you Francis Xavier Rivera? No, I'm Jimmy Carter. You have the right to remain silent and you have the right to-- Don't you think you'd better cuff me? I think we can trust you. [door closing] [soft music] You relax here a minute, Buster. We'll be right back. How do you know I ain't gonna split? You got no place to hide. [soft music] [door opening] [door closing] Sit down and wait. What you in for? Armed robbery. Ten counts of assault. How 'bout you? Grand theft auto. Okay, son, let's hear your side of it. Yes, ma'am. I'm very sorry for this whole mixup. It's a simple mistake. These officers, they thought they were doing their duty. I was an innocent bystander. It's a case of mistaken identity. Bullshit. Buster, you've been nothing but trouble since you were old enough to smash up your first car. Your parents have remanded you to the care of juvenile court. They simply do not want you around anymore. I'm afraid I'm going to have to put you in the care of the state correctional institution at Greenport for an indefinite stay. No sweat, judge honey. I've been to jail before. Your honor, maybe I have a moment? Of course. Greenport's an awfully rough place. He's not such a bad kid. Are you familiar with my program of Host Homes, Officer Burke? Oh, yeah. Isn't that that crazy program where they put the little crooks in with the nice people and screw everybody up? That is where youthful offenders get a last chance to be saved from going to prison. Buster, you spent time at juvenile hall and it did you no good whatsoever. I think what you need is a good, strong home with a good, strong father. Someone like Officer Burke here. This fat ass booger trying to play Starsky and Hutch? You gotta be kidding me. That will be enough of that kind of talk, Buster. Ma'am, I'm very busy. I have a wife. And a baseball team. Wonderful! Buster can learn some skill besides bumper removal. This could be his last chance. A kid whose father and mother don't even want to see him again. Ma'am, I couldn't. I couldn't be sure that when he was stealing home, he wasn't stealing my home. No, I just tell Buster that if there's any trouble, he'll go to Greenport for the maximum. [soft music] Ma'am, I couldn't. [Eddie] Buster, this is my wife, Mrs. Burke. Why'd a nice piece of fluff like you go and marry this deadhead for? I'm still trying to figure that one out myself. Now, we're gonna have a great time. But now first, you gotta get your rest. Tomorrow's our first day of practice with The Tigers. You wanna do your best. I'd rather go to jail. [Eddie] Now, what we're gonna do is we're gonna talk about the fastball, right? That is when you swing the bat so fast the minute you see the ball leave the pitcher's hand-- What are you doing?Nothing. Huh?Nothing. All right, all right. Now, that is how fast the fastballer-- ball is, right? Got any questions on that? Yeah. How do we know if it's fastball or not? You'll know. You'll know, right? You will know. All right, now on positions, positions. I want you all to be able to play the same position so we'll be able to be flexible, right? And then we'll be able to confuse the opposition and we'll be able to play as a team. Psst, Eddie, psst. Kids, everybody out on the field. We only got two more practices before our first game with The Cubs. [Eddie] What's the problem? Nobody wants to be catcher. Burt tells me can't get anybody to work behind the plate. You crazy? Sucker could get killed back there. [woman] Have you ever seen Johnny Bench's fingers up close? [disgusted] Yuck. All bent and broken and stubby and just-- All right, Sharyn, I won't make you be catcher. I wouldn't want to get sued for ruining your modeling career. You got that right. Timmy, you're a tough kid. How about you?I'm a bully, mister. I can't take it worth shit. Art, you got the build for it. You crazy, Fuzz? I wouldn't squat back there for all The Sugar Babies in the world. Catcher's don't have to run wind sprints. You got your catcher. [funny music] [kids cheering] [whistle] Het, stop it! [funny music] [whistle] Stop it! [whistle] [everyone shouting] [funny music] I got it, I got it! I got it! He can have it. Throw another ball right out there. [kids laughing] Where you been?Watching T.V. Let me see if your uniform needs taking in. I ain't wearing no uniform. Why not? I got a rep. Buster Rivera don't wear no fag threads. Look, I'll give you a choice between this uniform and the uniform they give you at Greenport. I got an 11 in neck. Ready? Hustle. Hustle, my ass. Let's go. Ready, group one, are you ready? Okay, go! Come on! Come on, Sharyn. Come on! Oh, Jesus. [cheerful music] Hold it. Hold it, Scoop. Is that your fast ball? Pretty cool, huh? Yeah, yeah. If the batter's 18 ft tall. Can I talk to you confidential? Yeah. I only got two pitches but I'm all you got. I know. I got fast and wild or slow and meatball. Can I talk to you confidential? Sure. I'm gonna work your tail off. Hey, Sergeant Kreeger already tried that. He gave up. He said if anybody tried to catch my fast ball, he'd arrest me for attempted murder. [Eddie] Play ball! [Buster] Yeah, Mikey. Pump jump, Mikey. Let's go, Mikey. That a boy, Mikey. Let's go, Mikey baby. Pump jump, no batter, no batter. Come on, Mikey baby. Mike, come on, throw it in. Come on, Mikey baby. Hump chuck, Mikey. No batter, no batter. Come on, Mikey. Hump chuck, hump chuck, no batter. Come on, Mikey baby. Hump chuck, Mikey baby. Hump chuck, Mike. No batter. No hump, no hump. Felix, are you all right? Geez, the guy's out cold. What'd your kid put on the ball? Lucky he didn't hit him with his curve. We can't play this game without a sanctioned ump. This game is called. Okay, whatever you guys say is okay with me. [man on microphone] The game between The Cubs and Tigers is called. It will be replayed tomorrow afternoon at 3:15. Thank you all for coming. Too bad we couldn't play you guys. Pansies. They look like their mothers taught them how to throw. You'll get your chance to show what you can do. Oof. [birds chirping] Take the field and play ball! Okay, guys, okay, today's the day you put it to The Cubs. [Burt] Spirit now, hump chuck gals, hump chuck boys. Just remember what we learned this week and you'll maul 'em.I don't feel so good. Me neither. I gotta get a letter from my doctor. I got jaundice. I have a debated septum. [kid] I have a hangover. I'm getting my period next year. Hey, hey, hey, hang on, people. [Felix] You waiting for an engraved invite? Let's play ball. [people cheering] Come on! [on microphone] Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the replaying of the season's opener between The Cubs and Tigers. On the mount for The Tigers is Mike Karpel. [murmus] What the hell did you do to your glove? I taped the sucker. I thought maybe you could find it easier. Just put the ball on the plate. Kelly Robinson. [kids cheering] Ball. Ball. Watch out. You could get hurt with this guy, come on. Okay, come on, now. Let's go, now. Come on. You give me a pitch, pretty boy, and I'm gonna take it downtown. [suspense music] Get off of me! What the hell. [hit] [kids shouting] What'd you put on this freaking ball? One of your god damn boogers, little creep? What are you doing? He put a snot all over the mother. I don't care what he put on it! Play the ball! You don't have to get all cranky. [man on microphone] Ralph Parks. Hump chuck, Ralphy. Let's go, Ralphy baby. Hump chuck. That's the way to stay in there, Ralphy. [Felix] Strike one. Hump chuck, Ralphy, that's the way, Ralphy. [Felix] Strike two. Ralphy can't hit worth shit. Hump chuck, Ralphy. Let's go, Ralphy. Come on, Ralphy baby.Mouth? Yeah? Do you ever stop talking? I don't think I can. Hump chuck, Ralphy. Let's go, Ralphy baby. Come on, Ralphy, let's go, Ralphy. Come on, Ralphy. [hit] [applause] [cheerful music] Out! What do you mean he's out? Your guy never touched first base. Can't you tag him yet? Oh. Move! You're safe. [man on microphone] You've just witnessed the first five magger in history that counts as a single. [kids cheering] What are you doing Thursday night? My hair. No, I mean who you going out with? Nobody. How about me?What about you? How about going out with me? Where?To the drive-in. Who'll drive? Your father? No, we can sneak in. I got two lawn chairs. You want me, the prettiest girl in the whole state, to go to a drive-in and sit on lawn chairs? Yeah. Ah, pick me up at 6:30. Okay. What's your name?Bobby. You got any jacks in junior? Yeah, I got Mr. Lawyer for home run. Got a date for the dance? Yeah. Gotta go. So long sorry about the dance. [cheerful music] Safe! [hit] Throw the ball! I'm trying, I'm trying. Throw it! Safe! [man on microphone] And, that's 12 runs for The Cubs in what seems to be the highest scoring game of the season. Strike. Time out. Play ball. [fart] Aw, help, a fart. [kid] Help, a fart. [on microphone] There seems to be some kind of trouble in The Tiger's dugout. We'll try and get a report. [funny music] [Felix] Play ball. [hit] Oh, it's in my shirt, it's in my shirt. [kid] Give me the ball! You get away from me. Give me the ball! You get away from me. [funny music] What are you trying, wanna win? I'm sorry. Jesus, this is embarrassing. You'd better watch it! Play ball. [funny music] [man on microphone] And now up for The Cubs, Scott Fitzsimmons. [cheerful music] [hit] Safe! [hit] [cheerful music] Safe! [man on microphone] Fifteen nothing, here in the top of the sixth. Tigers have a man on second and a man on first. Fritz Curtis is up. Your name Charlene? No. I could've sworn you were the one scared of gerbils in third grade. Nah. You sure you never went to Center School and freaked whenever you had to touch them? Hey, kid, why don't you keep your eye on the stupid ball? I was sure the kid's name was Charlene. Went crazy around gerbils. [hit] Go!Run fast. Run! And The Tigers load the bases. You got the bases load. [Fritz] Go, Fingers. Come on. [hit] [cheereful music] Don't brush yourself off! [birds chirping] [man on microphone] That's the ball game. The Tigers are ruled out for passing each other on the base pads. No run scored. All right, way to go, way to go. The Cubs win the game 19 to nothing. Hey, kids. It's only the first one. No sweat. Right? Hey, right? The kids are really gonna razz us to death when they hear about this. I'm gonna have to pound on the whole third grade just to make myself feel better. The other teams are even better than those turkeys. Nah. They weren't so good. Okay, okay, okay. So we booted her. But, we'll be better. We just need to work on fundamentals. Right? Okay? Let's go get some ice cream. I'll pass the ice cream this time. [kid] Me too. Same. I don't want any ice cream. [kid] I don't feel like it now. Does this mean I don't get any ice cream? You show me a kid who turns down free ice cream, I'll show you a baseball team that's in big trouble. [Eddie] T. T-R-A-I-N. Train. Okay. They're great kids, Eddie. You know, that's what worries me. They never gave up, no matter how rotten things got. They gave it their best shot. [laughing] Even though their best shots weren't the greatest. Yeah but what happens to those kids if they keep losing all season long. If you're worried bout it, why don't you tell them? Talk to them. Maybe we should give it a try. [kid] You want some pizza? [kids] Yeah, yeah. Anchovies? Don't you have any plain? [woman] Any kid, you want another Coke? [kid] Yeah! [chatter] [woman] Anybody want another Coke? [chatter] I wonder why God invented anchovies. [kid] Anyone some pizza? [kid] Anchovies. Don't you have any plain? [kid] Hey, where'd you get this? Let me have a piece. Ew, fish. All right, kids. [whistle] Kids, listen up, now. Stop me if I'm wrong, but I got a feeling you feel pretty badly about yesterday, right? [kids] Yeah. Yeah, maybe you wanna quit? [kid] Yeah. Look, I think you kids are about the best bunch any guy could ask for. You're funny. You're intelligent. You're quick. You make more sense to me than most adults. But, it's just too bad we can't play baseball. [kids] Yeah. Says who? Some adult says you can't play baseball, says you're no good. So you believe them instead of yourselves. Losing sure sucks. We could win if we try. My dad said he wanted me to quit the team. Everybody's ribbing him about The Tigers. Be fun to show them mothers we got what it takes. [kids] Yeah, yeah. Well, it's not gonna be easy. I just wish I can see their faces if we started winning. [kids] Yeah. If we got to the championships. [kids] Yeah! All right. Yeah [funny music] Patty, Patty, Patty. Look at the seams of the ball. Don't you look at the ball, look at the seams. Okay? [hit] All right, I'll watch the god damn seams. [hit] Roger, we gotta work on your throw to the plate. It's no good? It never gets there. We gotta put a little strength in your hand so that you can get some snap in your throws. So far the only exercise your hand gets is up your schnoz. Squeeze that. You squeeze it day and night, except when you're sleeping. You're gonna have the best peg in the outfield. [cheerful music] Out! You're out! All right, all right, Art! Good. [cheerful music] Strike three, you're out. ♪ Sweet Adeline ♪ My Adeline Hey, any called Adeline? She's waving for me. I'm coming, Adeline. [straining] I don't know no Adeline. Oh, well. What good are phones? Phones bother you. You invent this, mother? They never hear the end of it. [Eddie] Hey, Aesop. Okay, Aesop. That you, Burke? Open your eyes. Let's go. Can't open my eyes. What'd you do to this phone? Got no room in my head to store my lids. Still with a headache. Come on, I got your room all ready for you. I hear your crummy ball club's getting reamed by little old ladies. Using umbrellas for baseball bats. Word's out, is it? Here, sit down. My new bookie's got you 600 and a wood for the title. You're mindful that's all. Well, give the kids a break. They only dropped a couple of games. There's a lot of season left. That's revolting to see a man in that condition. I got this way drinking. You come by your ugly face naturally? [mad] Ugh! [laughing] You, guys, need an offense. We need a defense too. I'm gonna trade you a hot scoop for some drinking money.What hot scoop? Name of a new kid in town who can hit the ball. And he ain't joined no team yet. How'd you hear about him? Passed out in a bush. When I woke up, this kid and his old man were practicing, hitting some fungus. And I followed them home. No drinking money, Aesop. [sad] Ah-- Breakfast? You got yourself a deal. [doorbell ringing] Hey! [Oriental music] Kids. I want you to welcome our new teammate, Umeki Siddaharo. His ways may be a little bit different but I think you'll appreciate what he can do for our offense. I don't believe he's so good. Can he do any of this karate? [Oriental music] Hey! Oh, shit! [funny music] Hey! [suspense music] [hit] Hey! [hit] [suspense music] Hey! [hits] [suspense music] [hit] [funny music] [blow] Oh-- [people cheering] [Eddie] Good job, good job. All right, all right. Hey! Coming to bat-- Coming to bat, The Tigers' newest addition, uh, I hope I have this right, Umeki Siddaharo. [scatttered applause] [boy] Who's he? Hey! Time out. Is that growling legal? How the hell do I know? Sounds like a gorilla in heat. Just strike him out, Bobby. Time in, play ball.

[funny classical music] [cheering] Hey, Mr. America! Where do you think you're going? The ball hit me. The heck it did. Bullshit. Excuse me, sirs. Who the hell are you? Eaglescout Terwilliger. Observe, please, the game ball. There's plainly a streak of Kiwi black polish on the ball, thus proving it did strike him on the foot. Take your base. [kids cheering] Last inning, bottom of the sixth and The Tigers lead by one run. But The Pirates have last up. Come on, Mike! [man on microphone] Two men on base, two outs. [Burt] Two outs! One more, we've got it! [hit] [suspense music] [man on microphone] The Pirates win it in the bottom of the sixth. Thank you all for coming and for your patronage of our refreshment stand.

Yeah, but we're out of the cellar. You gotta creep before you can crawl. We're gonna keep on crawling until we solve our pitching problem. Mike's a good kid, but as a pitcher, he'd make a great outfielder. [doors slam] [engine starting] [man on radio] 2 Bravo 10, we've got a report of an 1106 at 319 Beachside Avenue. Mayfield House. 2 Bravo 10, that's a Roger. We're on our way. [siren] [doors slam] [birds chirping] [knocking on door] [unlocking door] Mrs. Mayfield?Yes. This way, officers.Thank you. [door closing] You have no security at all? I never thought I needed any security. But, I was hardly prepared for vandalism. I mean, I can understand theft for gain. But the wanton destruction. What time did you discover the vandalism. Thurston, my chauffeur, alerted me at 9:30 this morning. [birds cheering] [door closing] Gee, that's too bad. You didn't hear anything last night, Mrs. Mayfield? Not a thing. Who else lives in this house with you? Just my son, Danny. He didn't hear anything? My son is deaf, officer. Oh, I'm sorry. Well, we'll fill out the report, but cases like this are very hard to resolve. Unless of course, you have some idea who might've done it? I'm outraged, but I haven't a clue. How much did all these plants cost? About $600. [whistling] My sister had a fern. She killed it. I'm sorry to hear that. Is that your son, Mrs. Mayfield? Yes. I do hate him playing baseball all the time, but he does love it so. Do you think he'd consider being on our baseball team The Tigers? No, I don't think so. Besides, I couldn't condone it. Oh, yeah, but would you let him pitch? I should say not. Who knows what accidents could befall a child from a hardball. Or what germs lurk in a baseball field. Mrs. Mayfield, you don't want to make him into one of your hothouse plants here, do you? Part of me does. I get so anxious. He's all I have. Well, lend him to us. Let him be one of The Tigers. Let him grow up. Well-- if he wants to. [birds chirping] ♪ We're The Tigers no one could be prouder ♪ ♪ if you can't hear us ♪ we'll yell a little louder ♪ I wonder how you hump chuck a deaf pitcher. I don't know. Maybe if he sees us looking positive, he'll feel supported. Maybe.♪ We're The Tigers. [man on microphone] On the mound for The Tigers, pitching his first game, Danny Mayfield. Hump chuck, you deaf Danny baby. Hump chuck. Hump chuck. Come on, Danny. Come on, Danny. Hump chuck. Strike 3. You're out. [cheerful music] Strike. That kid's a regular pitching machine. [cheerful music] [hit] [both] I got it, I got it. You're out! Wanna go to the dance Saturday night? [man on microphone] Three up, three down for The Cubs. Still a nothing nothing tie at the bottom of the fourth. [Patty] Show me again. That means odd. Thanks, right? Hey, what are you kids doing? We're practicing our signals. See, the cutter ball has two fingers. And the slider with a droop is like this. [Eaglescout] And the submarine ball is a finger in the ear. The bastard ball is the whole hand. Come on, let's go. [people cheering] Bastard ball? [man on microphone] Now up for The Tigers, Umeki Siddaharo. [kids cheering] Hey! He's gonna walk him. Don't let him walk ya, Sid. [hit] [man on microphone] That ball's outta here. [kids cheering] The Tigers take the lead, one to nothing. [classical music] [man] Strike 3. Indirectly. [man on microphone] And The Tigers win it. That makes it eight in a row for The Tigers, putting them into a tie for second place. If The Tigers get past their next two games, they'll be in the championship, against the defending champs, The Panthers. [Burt] A bet's a bet, Kyle. You said we'd never get past second division. We beat The Phillies tomorrow, we're in the championship game against The Panthers. You know, you never would've done it, if you hadn't picked up Bruce Lee and Harpo Marx. The Lord loveth a good loser, Kyle. Well, I don't suppose old Burt would like to go double or nothing on the championship against The Panthers, huh? You'd have to be crazy to make a bet like that. Old Burt'd have to be crazy to take that bet. I'll take that bet. Old Burt's crazy. I just hope we get by The Phillies tomorrow, Burt. [bat hit] [kids cheering] Aww, baseball players-- my best. Get out. Shut up. Who are those guys anyway? They're creeps. They're on The Panthers. What do you think? Chumps. Bunch of turkeys. [kids cheering] Hey, Buster. Buster! Can I have a french fry? Let me have some. I couldn't believe that game today. Hey, kids, Tigers. Tigers. Chief Duggan has something he wants to say to you. Hi, boys and girls.Hi. Congratulations. You know, I think our community owes a debt of gratitude to all of you. By beating The Phillies, you are now ready against incredible odds to take on The Panthers for the championship. [everyone] Yeah! I know I speak for so many kids. [sniffing] Ugh, what the fart! [funny music] [everyone disgusted] [everyone screaming] You, young people will rule next week-- Oh! [funny music] [kids screaming] Man, that Luke Skywalker's something else. What happened to Darth what's his name? Vader. One mean breather. I don't believe Luke Skywalker did that thing without any special equipment. Why not? Ben Kenobi told him about the force. All you gotta do is believe in the force of good. That way you can hit your target with your eyes closed. Hey, think that will improve Buster's hitting? [laughing] Very funny, man. [electronic beeps] [kids chattering] [suspense music] [clicks] Uh! [electronic beeps] Ready? Yeah, let's go. Make sure you get the deaf kid's arm. Got it. [suspense music] Here you go, Danny. What are you doing? This is our game? Hey! They don't allow retards in here. Who let you in?Leave him alone. What happened when the sewer backed up? The Tigers. Pussies. Meow. Bug off. You'll get your chance on Saturday. Hey, pitcher. Hey, Danny boy, cat got your tongue. I'm talking to you. When I talk, you listen. Leave him alone, you know he can't speak. Listen, guys, let's just go on home. [imitating Sharyn] Listen, guys, let's just go on home. You Italian?Why? You wanna make something of it? Yeah, what's this mean? [struggling] [funny music] [struggling] [blow] [suspense music] Chicken shits. Yeah, punks. Thanks a lot, Sid. You okay, Sharyn.Yeah. Where's Danny? [kids] Danny, you all right? Sons of bitches. [soft music] Well, at least his arm's not broken. Well, the shoulder is separated. Damage is not serious. But, it's anybody's guess as to when Danny can pitch again. If I could get my hands on those criminals. The championship is a day after tomorrow. Is there any chance that the shoulder could reset and heal by itself? A 1,000 to 1 against it. I feel badly for Danny. Well, there is one long shot. What's that? Well, I really don't recommend it but there's an orthopedist by the name of Sternberg. He's done some work with some of the pro pitchers. And he manipulates the muscles and it allows the joint to reintegrate. Surgery? No, he just resets the joint. And, if it works, it's 100% right away. Where is he? Harvard, I believe. Would you get him for me, please? Mrs. Mayfield, you're really with us? The only way to teach those little cruds a lesson is for Danny to go out there and whip their tails. Cross your fingers, here come The Tigers. [crickets chirping] [knocking on door] Come in. [woman] How you doing? You know, any way I can believe in myself real quick? I don't think it happens quite that quickly, Buster. Yeah, well, if it don't, I'll bag it for the team tomorrow. I don't care what happens to me, but geez, they worked hard. Hey, so did you. Your fielding percentage has come way way up. Yeah, I know. I believe in you, Buster. Now, get some sleep. Tomorrow night, we're gonna be celebrating. Goodnight. Goodnight. [soft music] Hey, God? What do you say? I guess you don't need any new friends, do you? I need your help. My fielding's okay, thanks to Eddie Burke. He's a real nice guy. My batting average just-- well, awful. I need your help real bad, Sir. [soft music] [blows] Stop rattling The Grape Nuts. Hey, man, be cool. [blows] I'm sorry. Eggs will be ready in a minute. [phone ringing] Hello? Yeah? Oh, I see. Okay. Okay, if you think so. Right. Thanks, Mrs. Mayfield. So? Dr. Sternberg's in California, doing something to some tennis player or some dumb thing like that. There goes The Panther game. I'm sorry, Eddie. [sighs] Mrs. Mayfield says there may still be a chance, so she's gonna keep trying. So, we got a chance. [birds chirping] [Mrs. Mayfield] Now, are you sure you know exactly what you're supposed to be doing? But, The Chief said I'm not supposed to use the car unless it's official business. I don't care what Chief Duggan says. Use your light, use your siren, use your gun, if you have to! But, get that doctor to the field as soon as his plane comes in. Yes, ma'am.
