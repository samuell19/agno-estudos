adaptation of CHARLES DICKEN's novel produced and directed by JOÃO BOTELHO for LEONOR The scene was a plain bare monotonous vault of a schoolroom and the speaker's square forefinger emphasized his observations... Concrete things! Facts! Facts alone are wanted in life. This is the principal on which I bring up my own children and this is the principle on which I bring up these children. Otherwise... loitering, imagination, crimes... What do I know? Your parents are all unemployed. Who is that girl? I don't know her. I'm Cila, Sir. Cila? That's not a name! Come here. You should say Cecília! My father calls me Cila, Sir. What does your father do? He works in a circus, Sir, he does horse riding... Details are not important. He teaches horses, doesn't he? And works with them on the track. Another thing that doesn't matter. Does he treat the horses when they are sick? Yes, Sir. He is therefore a kind of veterinarian, farrier and riding master. By the way... A definition of horse. It's amazing! You don't know any facts about one of the most common animals. One of you. You, Vasques. Quadruped, herbivorous. It has 40 teeth, 24 molars, 4 canine and 12 incisors. Sheds coat in spring. It has hard hooves that need to be shod. Age is known by marks on teeth. Do you know now what a horse is? Go to your place! Tomás Cremalheira, gentlemen. A square man. to whom 2 + 2 are 4 and nothing else. Retired from the wholesale hardware trade, he is now devoted to his children, his school, his city. Secretly, he's still looking for a suitable opportunity of making an arithmetic figure in parliament. And now, boys and girls, if you had to line a room, would you choose a paper with pictures depicting horses? So? Yes!!! No!!! Of course not! And why? I would paint the walls. No paper. You have to line it with paper! You have to line it with paper! Have you ever seen, in fact, horses galloping on the walls of a room? Yes. No. No, no and no! Never see what you really don't see. Never have what you really don't have. Facts, facts, facts! Now, Mr. Teacher, if you want to teach the class I will be happy to watch. World Pit, a de facto city. A square city with several large streets, each like the other, and many small streets, even more like each other. Inhabited by people all alike, for whom each day is the same as the previous and the next. Each year is equal to the last and the next. The vast majority of the inhabitants of World Pit are a sum of miserable, unemployed beggars... In fact, a nullity. José Grandela, a very rich man. Banker, merchant, industrialist and all the rest. A man made of ordinary material. Always stating his former ignorance and poverty and his own triumph, conquered with his own sweat. A real tyrant of humility. Today he is visiting the Cremalheira family. I hadn't a shoe to my foot, as to a socks, I didn't know such a thing by name. I spent my life in pigsties. I was born in a ditch. Dona Teresa Cremalheira is extremely weak both physically and mentally. Whenever she showed any sign of life she was stunned by some weighty piece of fact tumbling on her. Now, she intimately hopes that it was a dry ditch. As wet as a sop! Over 20 cm. of water in it. Enough to give a baby a cold? I was born with inflamed lungs. With everything inflamed. I was so weak that I was always moaning. And your mother... She abandoned me, madam! She left me with my grandmother. The worst old woman who ever existed. She kept me in an egg box. I ran away as soon as I was old enough. So instead of one old woman beating me and starving me everybody beat me and starved me. Incredible! I'm astonished! You and Tomazinho, brought up in mathematical accuracy... What happened? Why is Tomazinho so sad? Dad caught us peeping at the circus. And your poor mother who expected it as much as finding you reading poetry. I declare that you make me regret having a family. My head is in such a state that I can't even remember half of the realities you can be entertained with here at home. Go and do something logical! Do not cry. When I was a bum no one looked at me with any interest. In brains almost designed with the precision of a ruler, from the cradle. It is incomprehensible! Bad company! The daughter of one of those bums. Cecília. Oh my poor head! It's all right, Tomazinho. Everything's all right with your father. This deserves a kiss, doesn't it, Luísa? Always my friend. Mr. Grandela put his hands in his pockets and accompanied his friend in the immediate and withering resolution of the problem. He took the opportunity to say, "I never wear gloves! That was not how I climbed the ladder." "If I wore gloves I wouldn't have gone up so high." Mr. Cremalheira's files indicated, in fact, the address of Cecília's father. It was not easily that they found the petty little tavern. To top it off, the vagabond had disappeared. He often failed his acts. He failed his acts? He jumped too short and fell. He was booed before yesterday, he was booed yesterday... It's as clear as water that the man was sent away. Excellent! I know how these things are. I was born in a ditch and my mother abandoned me. Do you think I forgive her? Never! She was the worst woman ever. Not to mention my drunken grandma. This man is a trickster! A tramp! Do you want me to go get her? If in fact the father abandoned her without the girl's connivance... Grandela... What if I took her to my house? No, no and no! No way! As an example to Luísa. Think about it, Grandela, from this point of view. My dear father! He'll be so unhappy without me! We're wasting our time. Look, your father left and you should have no hope of seeing him again. I came to tell this poor girl's father that she couldn't stay in school. But, in fact, circumstances have changed, and I am willing to take care of her, educate her and secure her future. Cila! If you want to stay here working with me, I'll be a mother to you. Cecília! You must have a solid and practical education. And even your father, I understand, thought so. Cecília stopped in her desperate cry, turned away from Raquel, looked around, and finally fixed her gaze on her protector. Everyone clearly perceived the change. She's going. If I leave, how will my father find me? If your father comes back, he will have no trouble finding Mr. Tomás Cremalheira. I am very well known. I'll get my clothes before my heart breaks. You are taking a long time today. Cremalheira's whim wanting to educate the somersault girl. It won't be good for the kitten. - Miss. Cremalheira? - Yes, of course. Luísa! As you said, only a kitten... You've been a second father to her. A second father to Tomazinho! I'll admit him to the office. Under my protective wing. Isn't he too young? He has to finish his studies. If Dona Josefina knew how I was at his age... Being a vagabond would be a blessing from God. A lot of luck. You went to the Italian Opera... Glowing out of the theater in white satin and jewels! I'm familiar with Italian Opera from a very early age. Dona Josefina, housekeeper, was one of Mr. Grandela's greatest reasons for pride. Highly connected, her late husband was, on his mother's side, a Vilaverde. When Mr. Vilaverde inherited his uncle's fortune, he owed more than twice as much. He never reached the age of 40, leaving the poor lady, ten years older than him, in a none too flourishing situation. At her age, with some pride and also needing of support, she decided to employ herself. Here she is, in her old age, with her Roman nose and the thick eyebrows that had seduced Mr. Vilaverde, serving José Grandela, World Pit's boss. A lady of the highest society. From the highest society! Cila! What was your mother like? I don't know. My father said she was a ballerina. Did he like her a lot? A lot. He was very fond of me too. But he left you... For my own sake. Among the multitude of unemployed laborers, at rest in Mr. Grandela's definition, Sebastião is a lucky man. He is one of the workers at the Grandela factories. He has a low salary, but a salary. A little stupid, unable to have opinions, Sebastião is, never the less, a good worker and a man of principles. As usual Sebastião paused in the street, feeling that the machines had worked and stopped inside his own head. - What are you looking at? - Embers falling... turning to ashes. How will we be when we grow up? Nonsense! After all the work we had, without looking at expenses, when with my paralyzed right side I heard you talking with your teacher about combustion, calcidation, calcification, all these things that could drive a poor invalid crazy, now you come to me, absurdly, telling me about embers and ashes. My great wish was to never have had family! I've already told you to hide that! Go home. It's too late. - It's a mire outside. - Always the mire. I'm never out of it. God help me, woman. You're back? I'm back and I will always be back. Get out! This is my bed! That night Sebastião only moved once to cover her as if darkness was not enough to hide her. The next day, as an obedient worker, he went to his boss for advice. I've heard that story. She started drinking, quit her job, sold the furniture, a fine mess... - I paid her to leave. - You'd be better off single. Was it an uneven marriage with regard to ages? - Do you hear this lady's question? - I was 21 and she was 20. Being such an unhappy marriage... Whoever does her harm... may the law punish me. You and your sacrilegious opinions scandalizing this lady, who had her marital misfortunes with the loss of millions of escudos? Millions! You chose your wife for better and for worse. If it went for the worse... The sooner she dies, the better. Mrs. Vilaverde was very impressed by the people's habits and continued doing lacework. - Did you see him? - Did you see the master? How did he look? Noble? Healthy? Yes. Oh, thank you. This year he was late. I'm leaving without seeing him. I saw you. You saw him... Tell me, where do you work? In the Grandela factory. For twelve years now. Let me kiss the hand that has been working for so many years in this factory. Give me the money! You are not well, woman. Leave me! Leave me! Let me go! Poor thing, she's so hurt. Be careful. This is worse than poison. She could well die. Sebastião! I'm leaving now. For God's sake, take care of her. Maybe she leaves you alone. He dreamt that he was marrying in a church with someone who had long been in his heart but it wasn't Raquel. From what mystery did he return to the places he knew? A nameless dread, a deadly terror. No! Mr. Tomazinho, dinner at eight, please. Mrs. Vilaverde doesn't like delays. And time took Tomazinho under the World Pit's boss' protective wing. Now he worked in the offices and even lived at Mr. Grandela's house. It's useless for you to go on studying. You are extremely deficient in reality. No tears! You're helpful to Mrs. Cremalheira and to the whole family. Especially now that my duties as a Member oblige me to be so often absent. I hope you can be happy under these conditions. It leaves nothing to be desired. You're thinking of your father? You should, in fact, be wiser. And time bound Cecília to the Cremalheira house, where every day realities poured down on her. And time pervaded Sebastião's misfortune. Mr. Grandela wants everyone to leave on time. I'm not everyone. And time continued its work in Luísa until she was ready. I come to talk to Grandela. I haven't seen you in so long, Tomazinho. He'll tell you why tomorrow. We will be together more often. I have absolute confidence in you. You are neither impulsive nor romantic. The fools embarrass these subjects with fantasies. What are the facts? You have, round numbers, 20 years. Mr. Grandela, round numbers, has 50. There is indeed a certain difference in age, but none in social status. This is the question you must ask yourself. Does Mr. Grandela asks me to marry him? He does. There's only one left. Will I marry him? I will marry him. Please tell Mr. Grandela I will. - Do you have any wishes regarding the date? - None, dad. Mr. Grandela is a remarkable man. And it was always my goal to raise you to have proper decorum at all times. Mrs. Cremalheira, I present you Mrs. Grandela. Have you settled on that? I just hope, Luísa, you have good health. Because if your head begins to crumble like mine as soon as you marry, I do not consider you worthy of envy. I will grieve all day now. What do you mean? I find the name José Grandela unbearable. And you know quite well that he won't allow me to treat him as José. Am I to treat my son-in-law as a Lord? Unless the time has come for a poor invalid to be trampled on by her own family. How should I treat him then? D. Teresa Cremalheira felt the weight of the serious problem to be solved in her head. Cecília looked at Luísa with amazement and pity. Luísa without realizing it looking at her. From then on she kept Cecília apart. Don't go to the North Pole, madam! Thank you. - I have news for you. - You do? I'm marrying Cremalheira's daughter. I wish you all the best. I hope to be very happy. Surely. In the factory offices there are rooms... where a quality lady as housekeeper, or rather manager, can be very helpful. If I don't descend the social ladder. In no way. During the engagement love manifested itself in the form of bracelets and always took an industrial character. Dresses, jewelry, cakes and hats were made, as were also alms and a vast assortment of realities. Thus the day has come, as they come every day. Luísa married Mr. Grandela and returned to live with her brother. Resigned to her new tasks, Josefina Vilaverde became convinced that as she strolled between the secretaries and the typewriters she spread a feminine, if not aristocratic, grace. She watched the treasures. Precious business ledgers, letters, checks with and without provisions, and a safe where Mr. Grandela made a point of having a reasonable amount of money. From every drawer, cupboard, and even safe, she had copies of the keys, proof of her boss's unsuspected confidence. And so, she was considered by all workers as the Dragon of the Factory. All closed, Bastos? All closed, ma'am. What have these bastards done today? The usual, ma'am. They conspire. I have always moved in a very different class. At least in the office, they are all punctual and hardworking. With the exception of Mr. Tomazinho. No names are mentioned here. Except for an extravagant individual. He would do well to follow your example. I don't even spend all my salary, which is very small. Instead of plotting, they could earn more... by spying on each other. Go see who it is. Thirty-five years old, good looking, good teeth, a true gentleman from head to toe. All this, Mrs. Vilaverde observed, femininely, in a second. Please sit down. You can leave now. I wish to meet Mr. Grandela, to whom I come recommended. I didn't want to appear to him directly at home. Now it's very rare for Mr. Grandela to come here. I asked a man, who seemed to have showered himself with something like dust. I suppose it was raw material. Allow me. I am the manager of Mr. Grandela's offices. I once had the good or the bad fortune of attending very different environments. My husband was a Vilaverde. Sorry, he was a... He was a Vilaverde! You must be very bored here. I am a slave of circumstances. And I have long adapted to the forces that govern my life. This city is certainly not the kind of place you are used to. The work is the most enjoyable and the highest paid job there is. All that lacks is to cover the floor with Turkish rugs! And there is no worker who doesn't want to drive and eat lobster. You must be absolutely right. My wife is younger than me. I don't know what she saw in me. She must have seen something. She's a very interesting lady. She has a great knowledge of politics and can give you good advice. Dr. Vaz Simões. He has joined your father's party. Júlio Vaz Simões. I have never been introduced to such a nice advisor. If you are given to gallantry you will make a career here. I foresee you will show the nation the way. Word of honor I won't. I dedicate myself to my party as if I believe in it. I want to pursue a career. You are a strange politician. Mr. Grandela was almost bursting from being silent for so long. He ordered dinner to be served. While the lawyer savored huge pieces of lobster thermidor, Mr. Grandela spoke of the smoke and smell of the World Pit. While the lawyer feasted on the stewed partridge and the caviar-filled scallions, Mr. Grandela made clear considerations about unemployment. "If there are factories stopped it’s because no one wants to work!" They were already at dessert when Luísa's brother arrived. When I was your age, I was on time. If not, I wouldn't dine. At my age you had no balances to check. That's not the point. So don't mess with me. You are a funny brother-in-law. Grandela is the funny one. My sister never liked him. Are you serious? If you know our father, it should be no wonder that Luísa married the old man. My freedom and my comfort depended on it. And your interesting sister? She doesn't care. Girls always find a way. All is so neglected. I'm here. My arms are my only breadwinner. Where will I find work in World Pit? I won't join you on strike. I have my reasons... Snitch! Traitor! Traitor! Snitch! I just hope you let me work. If I have any rights, this must be it. Sebastian was voted to the most lonely life imaginable. The first days seemed so long and painful that he began to be afraid. No one had yet spoken to him when, outside the factory, a very pale boy approached him on the street. Mr. Sebastião! Mr. Sebastião! Mr. Grandela wants to speak to you. Go to his place tonight. What do you want from me, Sir? Who's out there leading the workers' rebellion? my house, my parents... Mr. Sebastião... This is my brother. Why did you refuse to go on strike? I made a promise. You made a promise... Did you, a traveled man, ever meet a man like this other than in our blessed land? In fact, he doesn't show any kind of minimal social solidarity. Are you listening? Speak clearly! What do you complain about? It was you who called for me. What do people generally complain about? How do you expect me to know? You break up half a dozen, condemn them for felony... and send them to jail for the rest of their lifes. Last time you came here with a complaint, I warned you to change course. I didn't realize any of that. You're very stupid! Even your comrades don't want anything to do with you. You stay in the factory only until the end of the week. Then you're on your own. Look at my hands. If you refuse me work, where will I go? Heaven have mercy on us who walk this world. Where are you going now? Who knows. Don't you have a husband or children to care for? No. Not anymore. They died. I had a son. But I shouldn't talk about him. Tell them it's closed. It's Dona Luísa and a gentleman. Mr. Grandela! It's not Mr. Grandela. It's the lady's brother. Do you already know? I know enough, ma'am. What do you intend to do, Sebastião? I'll search for a job where no one knows me. This is to help you. Wait. When are you leaving? Monday. At night, after work, go walk around in front of the offices. Walking in front of the offices... If you see the doorman just pretend. It's for your own good, do you understand? I do. Let's go, Luísa? Goodbye, Sebastião. Good night, ma'am. She's gone. Thank God! A good thing on this damn day. Dr. Vaz Simões began to score points in his dedication to his party. With the practice of declaring himself honest in dishonesty, he quickly came to be regarded as promising much. In other ways, Júlio Vaz Simões also began to score points in Luísa's recognition. Following the mysterious instructions of Tomazinho Cremalheira, Sebastião spent his last nights at the World Pit in useless rounds through the offices of the Grandela factory. Write me. Stolen! Stolen! I've been robbed. I've been robbed?! With a fake key! With a fake key! It was not my fault! When I was your age I didn't snore! I didn't sleep enough! The offices were robbed. Robbed? But how much? If you want an amount, I was robbed of 150 000 escudos. - Oh my dear! - Sorry, Mr. Grandela. More precisely, 152 thousand and 480 escudos. Don't be a fool! If I'm not mistaken, Mrs. Vilaverde has the keys and sleeps behind locked doors. It was Tomazinho who found the broken safe. Do you suspect anyone? Of course I do! My brother? Where is my brother? And Dona Josefina, what do you have to say? Since I've been fulfilling, with all dedication, - the tasks that Mr. Grandela had the kindness... - Just finish, madam! There are only two people who could have done it. The worker who left or an old lady in black. I don't know about the old lady... But show me a disgruntled worker and I'll show you a man capable of anything. Tomazinho. Go to bed. Did you tell them we went to see those people? Didn't you ask me not to say anything to your husband? I remained silent. Mr. José Grandela decided to bring Dona Josefina to his house for a few days, to rest her nerves shaken by the uncomfortable event. Mrs. Vilaverde occupied her old room. She was an admirable woman to sniff around the house. How she went from floor to floor was an indecipherable mystery. From a lady of such decorum and such high standing, one could never suspect that she would slide down the bannister. And yet, the extraordinary ease with which she moved... What's the matter, madam? Is there a fire? I was considering the dew... What do you care about dew? It's not for me... I'm afraid Mrs. Luísa might catch a cold. She never gets cold. Don't you have your hot tea anymore? With a spoon of honey and a lemon rind? I lost the habit. If you keep losing all your habits... - Does Mrs. Luísa want to serve the tea? - Stop that! My wife will be delighted to get rid of that bore. You're not being very affectionate. You don't mind, do you, Luísa? No. You are not from the era of Tomaz Cremalheira's children. I don't understand what you mean. I don't mean anything! Come in. - What is it? - The lady's mother is very ill. Are you in pain, mom? There is a pain in this room. But I can't say it's in me. My dear mother. Your father is always away. I have to write and tell him. What, mother? It has been a long time since I stopped telling him anything. You've learned a lot, Luísa. Your brother too. Praises all day long. Don't speak, mother. There is something that your father missed. I do not know what it is. I can never say it. Maybe your father... This worries me. For God's sake, I want to write him. Give me a pen! Give me a pen! No matter what figures of such wonderful significance she began to trace on the blanket. Soon the hand that described them stopped. The mother of Luísa and Tomazinho, emerging from the shadow in which humans wander in vain, took the terrible solemnity of the wise. Tomaz Cremalheira came from the capital to organize the funeral and the paperwork. He buried his wife without sentimentality. Luísa and Tomazinho dressed in black for a few weeks. Mrs. Vilaverde, though not given to poetics, put into her mind an idea that took the form of an allegorical fantasy, a huge staircase, at the bottom of which was a pit of dishonor. Today, Mrs. Vilaverde has been all day in unbridled excitement. Mr. Grandela had left for the capital. The night of the pitfall had arrived. At the end of dinner, Mrs. Vilaverde feigned an indisposition. She apologized and withdrew, leaving Luísa and her graduate alone. My love. His and her voice. My love. No, not here. Where, Luísa? Leave me. Leave me, please. We have to be alone, Luísa. Leave me. A meeting, a meeting. Luísa? If he grabs me, I'll die. Leave me! When did I come to this room? Last night, Luísa. What are you doing here with me? I'd like to help you if I can. Did my dad tell you to say that? Luísa! Darkness. Evil. Aren't you afraid? No, Luísa. You'll never see her again. So much certainty in such beautiful lips. Did she ask you to say that? She didn't ask me anything. Isn't there any hope? I ask you! Leave tonight. This is absurd. I don't know what to do. I trust you will. May I have the privilege of knowing my enemy's name? My name? Cecília. The daughter of a vagabond. Júlio Vaz Simões turned into a pyramid of ridiculousness. Thinking about pyramids, he came up with the idea of going up the Nile, and immediately phoned his father. "The World Pit is over. I'll dedicate myself to camels." Send the servant to my room. He's gone to bed, sir. Tell him to get up! I want to pack my bags. Mr. Grandela returned from his short business trip. He had not yet set down his suitcase when Dona Josefina Vilaverde ran to him. Unable to contain the charge of explosives any longer, she burst. The sublime lady fell unconscious into Mr. Grandela's arms. His first reaction was to shake that burden, then twisted her fingers, slapped her hands and face, threw water at her, and finally filled her mouth with salt. Mrs. Vilaverde finally came to herself and informed Mr. Grandela of the terrible events. Tomaz Cremalheira, this lady has something to tell you. Madam. Can't you speak? It seems you've swallowed marbles. This lady happened to see your daughter and your mischievous friend in an outdoor conversation. Nothing happened. So tell me where is your daughter. Here at home. Here? Madam, I will be delighted to hear your apology. My nerves are too shaken. For all I did for you. And now I can only cry. Dona Josefina Vilaverde go somewhere I cannot see you. Allow Luísa to be cared for by Cecília. Do you mean that there are incompatibilities between me and Luísa? I fear there is an incompatibility between Luísa and all the relationships I created for her. Listen, I know the bricks, the factory, the workers, this damn city. These are real things. Your daughter does not properly recognize the merits of her husband. That's not reasonable. The high lineage ladies who would kiss the floor I walk... And your daughter is far from being a high lineage lady. If she has not returned home by noon tomorrow, I will send her bags here. By marrying my daughter you took on a great responsibility, for good and for worse. You know as well as I do why I married her. One day Raquel wrote Sebastião the following letter: "Sebastião, all over this town and who knows where else, you're treated as a thief." "Everyone talks about you in the most infamous terms." "You have to come back." This boy has his eyes wide open. I hope Tomazinho's work pleases you. - Mr. Grandela! Sorry for the boldness, Mr. Grandela. Is anything about the theft already known? No, madam, not yet. Rome wasn't built in a day! Come Cremalheira, let's talk about more serious matters. I want you to understand... (indistinct) Ah! What is going on here? Come on, madam. Come come. Come, madam, come. Or you'll go by force! What does this mean, madam? Mr. Grandela, this is the woman! But... Who asked you to stick your nose in my family issues? My dear José, it was not my fault. She dragged me. And you couldn't scratch her or break her teeth!? My dear son, I've lived always hidden. Never said I was your mother. Do you dare to call Mr. Grandela your son? A woman who abandoned him to a brutal grandmother? God forgive you, sir. So many slanders against my poor mother. She died in my arms before José was born. Didn't your child grow up in the middle of the street? When his father died, José was 8 years old. I made so many sacrifices. José was a serious boy. He had a good boss. Little by little he became rich and important. And he never forgot to send me once a year fifty thousand escudos. I don't feel obliged to have a conference on my personal affairs. As for the theft of the safe there was a mistake regarding my mother. I hate overzealousness. The same convoy that once took José Grandela's confused mother brought an innocent worker back to the World Pit. Attention! Stop, stop! He's still alive. Mrs. Raquel asks Luísa to go to the hospital. - My brother! - No Luísa, calm down. A dying man has a message for you. His name is Sebastião. I'm going with you, my daughter. I haven't forgotten you. I must speak to your father. He's right here. Sir... clear my name. Your daughter will tell you how. You suffer too much. My end is near. Raquel... Don't let go of my hand. How was this possible, my God? Every night I made a fake balance. So many people who hold positions of trust do the same. Leave. Go away. I can't be more unhappy than what I've been. May God forgive you. Not you. I want nothing to do with you. Poor Tomazinho. I sent my own son away. It's checked. One last favor, leave the police out of this. I don't know why I should always be doing you favors. Why are you looking at me like that? I'm fed up with you. You may have your high relations but you have no right to harass a man of my position. I see my presence displeases you. In this humble house you do not find the stage your genius deserves to stick your nose in at ease. Dona Josefina Vilaverde leave whenever you want. There's no hurry, but leave. I, the Grandela of the World Pit, must have shaded you a long time. Not at all, sir. If that portrait spoke... I have long been in the habit of calling him... imbecile! Mrs. Vilaverde, whose features resembled a minted medal to commemorate the profound contempt that Mr. José Grandela inspired in her, looked him up and down, sneered at him, and left. Mr. Grandela kicked the door, ran towards the portrait, and gazed at it with an uneasy look. It looked into the future. Five years later, he, the World Pit's boss, was to die in the middle of the street with a heart attack in front of some unemployed men. His admirable will benefited no one but a small legion of lawyers. Father, Cecília came to show her son. Dad? Dad? He fell asleep. Are you happy? Very much now. And you?
