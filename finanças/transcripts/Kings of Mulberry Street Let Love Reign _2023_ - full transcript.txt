What you want? I was Police Commander Muthia Muthen Veerasamy, a VIP. "A very important person." Nobody seems to remember me today. I seem to have a forgettable face. Hey, Fatty Boom Boom? [MENACING MUSIC PLAYS] - [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] - [SIRENS WAILING] [JAIL CELL DOOR CLOSING] Oh! [WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY] Oh! Veerasamy. Long time no see, Commander. Yeah.

Yeah, it's payback time. What they paying? You two rascals are gonna help me settle a score. What's he chooning? What you chooning? No rush. No rush. First, I wanna tell you a story. About my son's dog, Chomp. Hey, Chomps. Best dog in the world, eh? [VEERASAMY] Yeah, he was like a member of the family. He was dearly loved by my son and my wife. We loved him so much, so, so much. He was the best dog. One day, eh, Chomp bit another of my slippers. This, you could say, was the straw that broke the camel's hump. "Back." It's "the straw that broke the camel's back." You didn't tell me the story. Yeah, and the next day... It was a lovely summer's day, eh? I told everyone I'm gonna take Chomp for a walk. So him and I went into the cane fields. And he was running around, having fun, chasing butterflies and all that. - [DOG BARKING] - So then, I pull out my gun... I took aim... and pow! [DOG SQUEALING, WHIMPERING] You shot Chomp? - [HAROLD] What kind of monster are you? - You're evil! You... you... you told me he ran away. Hey! Hey! Hey, shut up. Be a man. You said Chomp ran away, and you couldn't find him. Hey, be a man. Damn it. So, if we could do that to our dearest Chomp, you think I'll think twice about you two dunces? I want you to help me steal this necklace... from this ugly geezer. [LAUGHS] You got jokes, uncle. [LAUGHS MOCKINGLY] Hey! Hey! You won't be laughing if your ma is six feet under. [FOREBODING MUSIC PLAYS] Hey, you're talking crazy, man. Yeah. Have you not noticed that we're children? Exactly. That's why no one will suspect you. Eh? You are local heroes, and you always got a plan, isn't it? Yeah. [IN AFRIKAANS] A Boer makes a plan, but an Indian has one. [IN ENGLISH] It's simple. You give me what I want, and I give you back what you want, alive. So what's it gonna be? What to do? What to do? Okay, I agree. We need to tell Charmaine and Reggie first. Make them swear an oath. I think we can trust them. But your old man, who thinks I'm old-fashioned and all... - ...he can't be trusted. - But why? Because he will insist on going to the coppers. But that's the right thing to do. 'Cause stealing is wrong. If stealing saves someone's life, how can it be wrong? That madman Veerasamy will hurt Ma. I'm sure of it. But if we don't tell my dad, then how will I be able to help? What you chooning, ek sê? I promised my dad, no matter what, if something bad happened, I would tell him first. I can't lie to him. Don't lie. Just don't tell him. You're always the one insisting that a promise is a promise. How can you go against that now? I wanna save Ma, just not in this way. Okay, all I know is your old man can't be trusted. So you go home and shut your trap. She's my ma, so I'll sort this out my way. [ROOSTER CROWING IN DISTANCE] Now, this is our time, boy. Let this be a lesson to you. When days are dark, friends are nowhere to be found. You the man. Yes, I am the man, boy. But you must be a man too. Be a man. I am the man. But... we're doing all this so that Mum can come back, right? S-so that we can be a family again. Uh... Yeah, for your mother's sake. Yeah, of course. Yes, sure. That's it. And that story about Chomp... That was just to scare the boys off, right? Yeah, obviously. Chomp is somewhere as happy as a pig in shit. Eish! You had me convinced. You're a good actor. Now, remember the rules. Do not fraternize with the enemy. She's a wicked, old cow, this one. [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] Cha! [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Cha! Chomp! Ow! [IMPERSONATING MICHAEL JACKSON] Shamone!

First, Baboo is in. He's come to his senses. Second, we need to know what we're dealing with. I think it's time for a stakeout. [GRANNY GRUNTS] You satisfied now? Very. Not mutton bunny, but it's almost as good as my food. [SIGHS] That hit the spot. [BELCHES] You want to help me to finish this? Why your mother left, son? She... No. No talking.

Hey, whatkind? We're supposed to be on a stakeout here. Small hiccup. I handled it. You blew your cover. Uncle Reg, I was thinking. We only have a few hours. Why don't we split up? Conduct surveillance separately? That way, we'll get more ground covered. And we'll meet you in the food court in two hours. Okay. [ADVENTUROUS MUSIC PLAYING] What?

I can't see it happening. Listen, we have to be tough and brave for Ma. We know what's what. We just have to figure out how. Ticky, this is getting too serious. Maybe we should take a chance with the coppers. - [REGGIE] I think your ma is right. - No. It's not an option. He's off his rockers. [HAROLD] And he shot his own dog, Chomp. He's capable of anything. There might be a way. Okay, choon. When we were surveilling the place, me and Baboo came across this place, like a theater. It was a cabaret show, for adults. What? Ek sê, what you doing? Hey, you! Sorry. They had clothes on. [TICKY] Just be quiet. [CLEARS THROAT] Anyways, they were having a show. So I thought, what if we staged a Bollywood show extravaganza with this famous Bollywood star from India? We could use it as an opportunity to get Veerasamy that bloody necklace. But how would we do that? We don't know any Bollywood stars, or any Indians from India for that matter. We don't need to know the stars from India, because we could be them ourselves. [LAUGHING] Hey, Ticky, you take the cake. Think about it. Ladies and gentlemen, all the way from Bombay, India, I present to you Miss Sweetie Ki Jawani. [BOLLYWOOD MUSIC PLAYING] [HAROLD] I don't know. It's still a rough plan, but we can make it work. I'm telling you. So you're chooning we must pretend to be Bollywood celebrities and stage a show? While that's happening, we steal the necklace? Exactly, ek sê. Finally, someone understands. That's a very crazy idea. Very. But if we can save Ma, I say let's do it. - Me too. - [TICKY CHUCKLES] [SIGHS] Okay, me too. You know, to have an extravaganza, you need a variety of talent. Not a problem. And to be from India, you need the accent. [IMITATING INDIAN ACCENT] Also not a problem. [LAUGHS] [CLEARS THROAT] Ek sê... [WHISPERING] We can dress your ma up and all. But she can't dance to save her life, and a Bollywood star must be able to dance. Yeah, that's a problem. Eish! [SIGHS] [KESSIE SINGING] Howzit, Kessie? Howzit? Hey, what happened to y'all the other night? Auntie Saras said Ma must have won a lot of money, 'cause she launched. Nah, nothing like that. Just got a small situation. That's all. Yeah, small situation. [KESSIE] Huh. But y'all know me. If y'all need any help, y'all just bell me. I'll be there one time. - For sure, Kessie. For sure. - Right? - Baboo? - Sure. All right. Let's go. Sit down. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [HAROLD] We're gonna need a lot of talented guys for this to work. [TICKY] All sorted, guzzie. Just follow my lead.

This my guzzie, Baboo. - [MAN] Whatkind, boy? - Good. [TICKY] Stones, still a man of no words? Hey, my brah is all about the rhythm and the rhymes, ek sê. No time to conversate. Listen, guys, I need y'all's help. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [TICKY] One down. One to go. - [HAROLD] Who we looking for now? - [TICKY] Lucky. [LUCKY] Follow the stone. Follow the stone.

I'll check y'all later. Almost home time. Go. [TICKY] Come. Park, yeah. Why we need this guy? - Remember those Chappies you bought? - Yeah. - They were in your pockets, right? - Yeah. Check your pockets. [COMICAL MUSIC PLAYING] - Two cent. - Lucky! Hey, come on, man. I know where you boys live. Hey, Lucky. I have a bad feeling about this, ek sê. You wanna teach your ma to dance? No. Then this is it, brah. No, thank you. You two ruined my party. What do you want? Uh, sorry about that. I thought some entertainment was a good idea at the time. It was not a good idea. It was a very, very bad idea. He said he was sorry. What you want, blood? [TUTS, SIGHS] We need to talk to you privately about an urgent matter. If you want to talk to me, then you'll have to play, or else you can get lost. [HAROLD] Hey. [WHISPERING] This is for Ma. - [SNAPS FINGERS] - Girls. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [HAROLD] We need your help. [LEILA] What makes you think I'll help you two losers? [HAROLD] Because you're a brilliant dancer, and we need you to teach Ticky's ma how to dance like a lady. - [LEILA] Why? - She's taking part in a competition. [LEILA] What competition? - It's like a show. - [LEILA] Can I be in the show? No. Well, then I guess there's nothing more to discuss. Okay. We'll see what we can do. [LEILA] I'll only help you if I can be in the show. Witch! I knew it was a bad idea. [TUTS] Relax, ek sê. She'll get the job done. Besides, it'll be nice having her around. That's why you asked her? No. I really think she can help. You better not get distracted, ek sê. I'm chooning you. You're like a lovesick puppy around her. [TUTS] You're nuts. You're cuckoo, cuckoo for Leila. Sis, man! [CALL TO PRAYER OVER PA] Harold? I think the other day was a misunderstanding. We don't have to go to Johannesburg right now. But how about we visit the school in Pietermaritzburg tomorrow? It's closer to home, and we'll have a good idea of what these private schools are all about. They are having an open day tomorrow, so I put our names down on the list. What do you say? Whatever. Okay, then. So I'll get your suit ready in the morning, and we can leave by 10:00 a.m. [DOOR OPENS, SHUTS] [DEV SIGHS] - Walk. - Okay. [COMICAL MUSIC PLAYING] [TICKY] Aiyo mother! Look at her. She can't even walk right. Okay, I'm ready. Let's dance. She looks like a drunk monkey that's been stung by a wasp. Your girlfriend better do some magic, 'cause Ma's life depends on it. Stop that right now. Where are you going? I can't watch this disaster, ek sê. I'm gonna fix a chow. - I'll have some. - I wasn't offering. Hey, where you found this one? So bossy, she is. Don't you have something better to do? No. Let's go again. [DEV] Harold? [COMICAL MUSIC PLAYING] Like that? Uh-oh. Looks like someone's in for it today. [DEV PANTING] Good day, Mrs. Chetty. Come. We're late for our appointment. But we can still make it on time if we get going now. I'm not going. If you like that school so much, then you go by yourself. Listen, young man, I will not tolerate you being disrespectful to me. I will say this one time. Let's go. Do you want to turn out to be like these backward simpletons? Do you? [HAROLD] At least they like me for who I am. And not trying to change me or get rid of me like you. Reggie! We got a problem, a big one. Go play. Go. [DEV] They don't know the meaning of self-improvement. They have no aspirations or dreams. I told you, Harold. This is for your future, a better one than this. He think we're deaf? [HAROLD] Leave me alone. My future is here. Go away. [CHARMAINE] Hey, Dev. That's enough. We're not deaf, and we're not simpletons. Hey, shut up, you bunch of nincompoops. Hey! You got a bloody cheek waltzing in here. Relax. Wait! It's good that he's here. Ma doesn't have her pressure tablets. Listen, yeah, my ma needs this. Hmm. What luck! [CHUCKLES] What you mean, "luck"? So without this, the old bat will kick the bucket, without any powwows, without any cover-ups. Natural death. Hey, you hurt my ma, ek sê, I'll beat you so bad your own mother won't recognize you. [MOCKINGLY] Ooh. I'm so scared I'm shaking in my boots. You should be scared. You don't know who you're messing with. Uh, this is none of my business. I'm just gonna take my son and leave. [VEERASAMY] This is your business, larney. Eh. Your kid and this nincompoop ruined my life. It's payback time. Karma. We have to get going. We have an appointment. What? You're going past by the cop shop? Eh? Eh? Anything can happen to this boy, especially if someone phones the welfare people to tell them that a neglectful father lets this son run around a casino with loafers and all that. You're a journalist. Don't you think that will be one heavy story? Huh? You losers better get a good plan together. Or else, it's tickets for that old bat. We had a deal. Yeah, she'll stay alive if you stick to your side of the deal. Ticktock, ticktock... goes old granny's big clock. Yeah. [CHUCKLES] Ticktock, ticktock. [LAUGHS] Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock, dead. I'm not gonna play with her. - What in God's name is going on? - Yeah! [GRANNY] Hey, Marlon. Marlon. Marlon. Marlon! I know you're not sleeping. Hey, Marlon! Hey, old lady. What you want, man? Anybody ever tell you you're very demanding? [SARCASTICALLY] Oh, I'm so sorry for you. You should have kidnapped someone less demanding then. So what now? Sew buttons. Ah! Very funny. Seriously, I'm not joking. I've got a proposal for you. - Proposal? - Yeah. How about if I give you 1,000 rand, and you let me go? One thousand rand? Where you got 1,000 rand from? I won it, how. What the hells? You had this all along? Oh, I forgot. Old age. I hope you're not pulling my leg. I'm not pulling your anything. - I'm a decent lady. - [MARLON] Yeah? So then where's the macha? [GRANNY] It's not there, man. So you are lying to me. No, I'm not. It's in my brassiere. Aiyo! Why... why... why are you telling me this? Look here, Marlon. I'll give you 1,000 rand, right? Then you take the money. Give it to your mother. Say it's from your father. So maybe, you all can get together again. And then my old man? Tell him I escaped when you went to relieve yourself. Hey, he'll beat me up! Oh God! So how much do you love your mother? Okay, fine. Let's do this fast before he comes. Quick. Quick. Okay. Quick. [COMICAL MUSIC PLAYING] [MARLON GRUNTS] [GRANNY SIGHS] Muruga, thank you. [GRANNY CLEARS THROAT] [SIGHS] [CRIES IN PAIN] What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? I'm asking nicely. [CRIES IN PAIN] - [GRANNY] Rascal! - Ow! - [GRANNY] Take this! - Ow! [CRYING IN PAIN] Take this! - Tie me up? - I'm sorry, Ma. - Who do you think I am? - I'm sorry. [IN TAMIL] Bloody fool! [CRIES IN PAIN] [IN ENGLISH] You kidnap me, and you try all this nonsense. For what? So that your old man can torture us? Rascal! - Ow! - Rascal! Give me the keys! Eish! [MARLON SIGHS] [TICKY] So that's the whole story. Breathe, larney. Yeah, but we do have a plan to save Ma too. [DEV] But you are children. How can you even allow this? Have you ever loved someone so much you'd do anything to save them? Then you know, ek sê. [HAROLD] I love Ma too. I'm not going anywhere. So what do you want to do? I guess I have no choice but to join you. Someone needs to watch over you. We promised each other that. Hey, larney, I got the perfect role for you. [KEYS JANGLING] You know, Ma, I'm really sorry. I didn't wanna do any of this. But my old man made me do it. If your old man says you to jump off a bridge, you'll do that too? [MARLON] No, but you don't know, Ma. Since he lost his job, things have been hectic. He fights with my ma all the time. She got so fed up, she even left. Then why you didn't leave too? Wh-who will take care of him then? [GRANNY SIGHS IN FRUSTRATION] Uh, try the one with the blue mark. Now you're telling. [MENACING MUSIC PLAYING] [WHISPERING] Just look at them. [EXHALES] - [HAROLD] Hell's bells! - You're telling! But we have to make this work. We have to. And now, what you want? My old man sent me here to check on y'all. You know, keep an eye on things and all. Your old man can go fly a kite. [WHISPERING] Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. Hmm. I don't like you, not one bit. Stay out of our way. You got it? Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! - This guy got one heavy shiner. - What happened? Your old man hit you? No. Your ma did. [ALL LAUGH] Ma. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [HAROLD] Aiyo! Blow. Eh? Eh? Hey. Lucky, I'm sorry to say this, but you need to clean yourself up. [SNIFFING] Why? Let's jam. Drop one beat. Let's go. [BEATBOXING] You're supposed to be an Indian from India. Say it in an Indian accent, please. Greetings, I am Dilip Kumar Singh, but you can call me Sonny. Hey, larney, you're killing me here. Okay, this Indian thing is not gonna work. Let's do this. Let's embrace your inner coconut. I don't understand. How? Coconut. Brown on the outside, white on the inside. Be a white guy. A whitey from Great Britain. [DEV CLEARS THROAT] [IMITATES BRITISH ACCENT] Greetings. I am Dilip Kumar Singh, but you can call me Sonny, old chap. Finally, now we're getting somewhere. But won't it seem odd? I'm supposed to be a Bollywood producer from Bombay. How, larney, don't you know? When the English colonized India, they colonized the people too. It's history. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Harold? [PHONE LINE RINGING] [SIGHS] Hello, my dear. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] It's me, Dev. Sorry for calling so late. It's been a really long day. - [WOMAN ON PHONE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] - No, no, nothing's wrong. There's just been a change in plans. I won't be able to come up to Johannesburg after all. I'm so disappointed too, my pumpkin. [LAUGHS SOFTLY] Uh, my son has been cast in this very big show, you see? At the Plantation Hotel and Casino. No, no, no. Don't worry about coming down. I couldn't possibly ask that of you. And besides, things with Harold are so hectic, I wouldn't have much time, and you, my dear, deserve my full attention. Have a good night now, my angel. Kisses, my cutie pie. Bye-bye. [HAROLD] Who are you talking to? You bought pie? Yes. Yes, I bought pie. For work. I bought pie for work. [SIGHS] [WATER RUNNING] [TICKY] Relax, larney. Just breathe. Everything will be okay. Breathe. Be a coconut. Oh, good morning, Mr. and Mrs. Volobuev. I hope you had a good sleep. Breakfast is at the pool. Thank you so much. [CHUCKLES] [BOLLYWOOD MUSIC PLAYING] [DEV IMITATING BRITISH ACCENT] Mr. Monty Naicker. Monty Naidoo. What a pleasure it is to finally meet you, Mr. Monty. - Well, I... - Great pleasure indeed. I beg yours. How can I help you, sir? Oh no, my good man. We can help each other. The name's Dilip Kumar Singh, but you can call me Sonny. All my friends do. Yes, Mr. Singh, how can I help you? Well, my good fellow, you might not know me, but I only manage and produce some of the most celebrated Bollywood stars. You might even know some of them. Amitabh, Salman, Govinda, Madhuri. Well, it just so happens that I have one of India's most popular rising stars with me, and she wants to host her Bollywood extravaganza here, at your very fine establishment. Popular rising star? Who? [UPBEAT ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] [WHISPERING] Aiyo mother! What the bloody hell? Breathe, ek sê. Everything will be cool. Just breathe. And how do you do, madame? I'm Monty Naicker... Naidoo, at your service. [MONTY CHUCKLES] [GIGGLING] Oh, Monty, you're so funny. Oh, Sweetie, you're so sweet. [LAUGHS] That's my name. [MONTY] I know. I know. Hey, how you made my ma look like that? You said she must wow. That's wow. Anyways, haven't you watched Pretty Woman? Julia Roberts? She's so hot. You're so old-fashioned. I have a lot of people working under me. E-everyone in maroon, in fact. [HAROLD SNIFFS] [WHISPERING] Lucky. Hey. Howzit, kid? You asked me to clean up. Yeah. Right. Great. I never clean up, because women simply can't resist me. These are yours. And please, don't hesitate to call me with... - [PHONE RINGS] - One second. Thank you. Uh... Oh. Sorry. Put him through. - Like putty in my hands. - [BOLLYWOOD MUSIC PLAYING] Guys. - The view. - Look at this place. - Look at the view. - Look at the TV. [TICKY] Three, two, one. [ALL] Yay! We did it! How's this place, ek sê? [SNIFFS] Guys, look at this place! Here. - A TV! - Hey, top! Where's the remote? Ticky. I think Leila is warming up to me. [IMITATES KISSING] Seriously, ek sê. She even touched my hand. You better stay focused. Yeah, I will. I promise. [BOLLYWOOD MUSIC CONTINUES] [TICKY WHISTLES] Check here. This is not a holiday. Here's what we're thinking, me and Baboo. The larney here will MC the entire show. [IMITATING BRITISH ACCENT] Ladies and gentlemen... We kick the show off with some music. Sticks and Stones, y'all do your things. And, Leila, maybe you can perform too. Of course I will. I didn't join for nothing. Then Lucky will get us the key to Sellers's safe. [HAROLD] Uncle Reg, you have to park in the background. We can't risk Monty recognizing you from the other day. Okay. How we know the big man's even gonna be there? Mr. Monty confirmed that he'll be attending. He apparently has a thing for, uh... exotic showgirls. Exotic? This one? [SCOFFS] We must keep the old geezer and the creep Monty occupied at all times. We must never let them out of our sight. Then that scumbag Veerasamy will cut the power to the security room. Got it, jackass? Yeah. No. No. You're talking too fast. I wasn't talking too fast. You were listening too slow. Wake up, man. So your old man cuts the power, Ticky gets the necklace, and we all leave through the back doors of the theater once the show is over. So any questions? Hey, this guy! Put your hand down. [BOLLYWOOD MUSIC PLAYING] [IN HINDI] Well done! [MARLON] Ow! Mesdames and messieurs. Mesdames and messieurs. Mesdames... Hey, larney, coconut. Da-da-da-da-da-da. Face. Da-da-da-da-da-da. Face. Ticky, check. Here comes the full Monty. Hey, larney, sort it out there. - [DEV] Mr. Monty Naicker. - Naidoo. We've got so much to talk about. - [MONTY] We do, but I would love to have... - Don't worry about Miss Sweetie. ...just two minutes with Sweetie. Sweetie? He gone? What happened? [IMITATING BRITISH ACCENT] You've outdone yourself, dear chap. These flowers look simply delightful. But Miss Sweetie doesn't like to be interrupted during rehearsals. You know how these stars are. A bit of a diva if you ask me, but hey, that is why the public love her so. Well, I was hoping to extend a personal invitation to Sweetie to have a private dinner with me. [UNDER BREATH] Oh God, no! No? - [LAUGHS] Of course, yes. - Yes? Dinner? You, Miss Sweetie? Of course. Wonderful. [CHUCKLES] You're a very, very busy man. Go about your business now and don't give it any further thought. [MONTY] Right. Yes. I shall. [WOMAN] Dev? Oh, Dev, it is you. Nancy? Is that you? I didn't think I'd find you this quickly. [SIGHS] It must be a sign from the good Lord. Oh! [LAUGHS] Aiyo mother! Uh... Uh... Hey, back to work. Show off your leadership skills, ek sê. Go. [SIGHS] Uh... Those are lovely. Hmm. Um, who are the flowers for? Who are the flowers for? [INHALES SHARPLY] Who are the flowers for? - They are for you, of course. - Me? Oh! But you didn't know I was coming. Or did I? I have a very strong intuition when it comes to you, my dear. Oh. [GIGGLES] Oh, I hope you don't mind that I'm here. When you mentioned this resort, I thought, "You know what, Nancy? You deserve a holiday and to meet the man who's captured your heart." Here I am. [DEV IMITATING BRITISH ACCENT] Well, you do know, madam, the show is on Sunday. It's a one-night thing, so be sure to get your tickets ASAP. If you snooze, you will lose. [IN NORMAL VOICE] I thought I saw a bee. Oh. - False alarm. - I see. [CHUCKLES] Were you referring to your son's show? Huh? Yes. Yes. Yes, I was. Oh. Okay. Shall we meet for dinner? Dinner? Uh, yes. Sure. I'll meet you in the lounge at 7:00 p.m.? That sounds lovely. [GIGGLES] I'll see you later, Mr. Intuition. - [GIGGLES] - [DEV CHUCKLES] [COMICAL MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANS] Hey, larney. You all right there, man? You look a little bit stressed. Come sit here, boss. I think I'm having a heart attack. [SIGHS] [REGGIE] Catch your breath a bit. So, uh... who's your lady friend, the one you were talking to? An old friend from Johannesburg. She's here on holiday. Oh really? She looked very happy to see you. She's not my friend. I've never actually met this lady in person before today. I told her not to come. But out of the blue, she pitches up here, and I have no clue what to do. Hey, ladies today are so forward. You saw Charmaine with that short, short shorts and all. No shame. That's another story. Eish! Jesus, she was expecting Indiana Jones. I could never be Indiana Jones. Only on the phone, I can be Indiana Jones. [SIGHS] This is so stressful. Hey, calm down, larney. Just now you'll blow a gasket for real. So you got a girlfriend. No harm there. [SIGHS HEAVILY] I met Nancy in the lonely hearts column. [CHUCKLES] [DEV] The one from the paper. I was supposed to take Harold up to Joburg to meet her. But I was secretly relieved when that couldn't happen. I haven't told Harold about her. The way he's behaving, he'll never forgive me. He'll think I'm betraying his mother. Sometimes I feel like I am too. Don't fret, man. In all my years at AA, I learned the best way to handle things is to just own it. Be a man. Tell the boy now before he finds out another way. But I'm waiting for the right time. There's no right time, larney. There's only now. You know another thing I learned at AA, ek sê? Hey. Heavy gas can make you feel like you're having a heart attack. True as Bob. [LAUGHS] [UPBEAT POP SONG PLAYING] ♪ I spend my days Trying to catch your eye ♪ ♪ You got my heart beating overtime ♪ ♪ At night I dream That your love is mine ♪ - [POP SONG FADES] - [SAD MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, man. [GRUMBLES] This... [GRUNTS] Okay, right. Good. Hello, you good-for-nothing lowlifes. Your time is running out. This is just a reminder of what's at stake for you. [CHUCKLES] Don't worry. The old cow isn't dead. Not yet! But that depends on you. Eh? [LAUGHS] It's not nice to see the elderly suffering, eh? But when you play with fire, you get burned, guys. [LAUGHS] Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, you. Get down! Get back down! Hey! Hey! Hey! Ma wouldn't be in this situation if it wasn't for me. And me. I think it's time for reinforcements. - [KESSIE ON PHONE] Hey. - Howzit, Kessie? [ADVENTUROUS MUSIC PLAYING] Who are all these people, ek sê? Hey, kid. We know guys who know guys. Pulled in one, two favors and all. [LUCKY IN HINDI] Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. [IN ENGLISH] Hey. Guzzies from the district. Never let you down. Thanks, guys. Looks like we have a show. Dad? [OBJECTS FALLING TO FLOOR] [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] [LEILA GRUNTS] [GASPS ANGRILY] [NANCY] Dev? Dev, are you all right? I waited for you all night. - [MONTY] Are you still studying the menu? - Yes. I'm sorry. [IMITATING BRITISH ACCENT] Oh blimey! You will not believe the technical difficulties in creating a show such as this. It's positively monstrous. Why are you talking like that? [MONTY] Sonny, naughty boy. [CHUCKLES] What say we have a spot of tea, my dear? Jolly good? Are you mocking me? Is it because I'm English? [IN NORMAL VOICE] No, no, no. It's a long st... [IMITATING BRITISH ACCENT] It's a long walk to freedom, dear lady. And one must pass through the valley of the shadow of death before we reach the mountaintops of our desires. "Desires"? What kind of a sick pervert are you? Oh Jesus. What is happening? I knew Kessie would come through for us. He's packing the place. Larney, whatkind, man? Hey, Baboo, your old man's fretting so much he's gonna shit himself. Do something. Good. Let him suffer. What's your beef? [SIGHS] [TICKY SIGHS] Mr. Sellers, welcome. Indian custom. There you go. So sorry about that. [BELL RINGING] [ROUSING ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYS] [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] [IMITATING BRITISH ACCENT] Ladies and gentlemen, dames en here, mesdames and messieurs, namaste.

Just relieved to have survived that. Okay. I'm going now. Y'all know what to do. - Just stick to the plan. - Yeah.

What now? - Why did you lie to me? - [TICKY] About what? About Leila. I saw you last night. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Oh, really? I saw you kiss her. What? I didn't kiss her. She kissed me. [HAROLD] You're a liar. [TICKY] Listen, I've had enough of you and this Leila nonsense. Now, shut up and help me find the safe. No! Admit it first. You stole the love of my life. You're really working on my nerves. I'm gonna blow a fuse just now. [TUTS] [TICKY GASPS] Key. - [HAROLD] No. - What? You and my father think I'm a fool. Well, I'm not. What are you talking about? You're a big fat liar. You're supposed to be my friend, my best friend. You, my father, and his ugly girlfriend can all go jump off a cliff. [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR LOCKS] [TICKY] You weakling! - Open this door and give me the key. - No. Not until you realize what you did. [TICKY] Oh, God! Firstly, you can't steal someone's girlfriend if they're not really your girlfriend. And secondly, your old man's girlfriend isn't that ugly close-up. What do you mean she's not that ugly close-up? Oh shit! The power's back. Baboo, this is serious. [HAROLD SIGHS] [TICKY SIGHS] Baboo. I didn't wanna tell you about the white lady, because I didn't know what to do. [WOMAN SNORING] [ADVENTUROUS MUSIC PLAYING] Huh? Sush. Sush, look. Hey! Move, Fana! Move! Move! Move! I wanted my partner back, like how things used to be, before that bloody devil Leila. That was selfish. I know. I'm sorry, ek sê. I should have told you everything. Please give me the key. For Ma's sake. - [DOOR OPENING] - [TICKY] Please. [DOOR CLOSING] - [FANA] Move! - [SUSHI] Move! Move! Hold it right there. Hands up. Get them up. Get them up. This is a restricted area. What are you doing here? [IMITATING INDIAN ACCENT] Thank the lords you are here. Now, I can find my way back. I was having a heavy load on board. Huh. That... that does not explain what you are doing here in the big man's room. Aiyo Rama! What a drama! You see, sir... Uh, sorry, madam-ji. I wanted to go number two in the backstage lavatories. - You know, the one for the show? - Uh-huh. But they all were not working. So my director-ji, he told me, "Go upstairs and relieve yourself." So I went upstairs, and here I am. Hey. Hey. Check out the loo, brah. Make sure everything is safe and clear. [TICKY] I don't know about safe. I stunk myself up. - [PASSES GAS] - [TICKY GRUNTS] Let's give it some time to air, unless you want to check it now. - No, no. Good idea. - Hmm. I'm in agreement, most certainly. You know, madam-ji, I don't think I'm done with the lavatory. [FANA] Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. Let's go! - Move! Move! - Move! Move! Where are the boys? They're not back? They should've been here. It's almost time for the finale. Ladies and gentlemen, the act you've all been waiting for, one of Bollywood's greatest dancing sensations, the inimitable Miss Sweetie Ki Jawani. - [AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] - ["JAWANI JANEMAN HASEEN DILRUBA" PLAYING] [DEV] Harold? Harold. Harold! What's going on? Where are you going? Nowhere. And it's none of your business. What's wrong? I can see you're upset. So what? You don't care about me. You only care about yourself and your stupid girlfriend from Joburg. That's why you wanna send me away. You're a liar, and you're cheating on Mom. [DEV] I never, ever wanted to get rid of you, Harold. I thought I was doing what was best for you, what your mum would have wanted. I miss your mum so much. Ever since she passed away, I've been so lonely, like there's a huge hole in my heart, you know? I thought if I had a lady friend, I wouldn't be so lonely. I'm so sorry, son. I wanted to tell you myself, but I was so scared. Because you're a coward. And I'm a coward just like you. I ruined everything. What happened? [HAROLD] I messed up the plan. Because of me, Ticky got caught, and we'll never see Ma again. This is all my fault. Look at me, Baboo. Look at me. We all make mistakes. That's life. It's how we fix them that counts. Right now, we have two choices. We can either be cowards and run away, or we can face our fears, no matter how difficult it is. What's it going to be? I wanna do the right thing, but I don't know how. We'll figure this out together. [AUDIENCE CHEERING] Good. You're here. I was starting to fret, bru. There's been a change of plans. We need your help. Go with Baboo. He'll explain everything. Come.

Lucky, you got us so scared for nothing. Uh, it wasn't me. I also got skills. Y'all never bothered to ask. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [ALL LAUGHING] [MARLON] Don't get too excited, auntie. We still have to get Ma back. Uh, "we"? [VEERASAMY CHUCKLING] I knew you boys were the right buggers for this job. And right on time too. 'Cause I was going to murder the old bag with my own two hands. We kept our side of the deal. Now, let Ma go. Give me the necklace first. [CHUCKLING] Hey, you. Where you think you're going to? I'm going to be with people who know what family means. [IN TAMIL] Love and blessings. [IN ENGLISH] Family? Family? Hey, I'll show you a family. Bugger off! I don't need you. I don't need anyone as long as I got this. Ungrateful dog. He'll be back. [CHUCKLING] [REGGIE WHISTLES] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [VEERASAMY] And now? What's going on? Y'all came here to fight?

[VEERASAMY SCREAMING IN PAIN] In there, larney. This guy messed with the wrong granny! And he's out! [SELLERS AND VEERASAMY GRUNTING] I've never been treated this way. By women! - Those are thugs, gangster grannies. - [SIRENS APPROACHING] [SELLERS] You are responsible for this, Veerasamy. You greedy son of a bitch! Greedy? Greedy? You're a miserly, miserable old geezer. - Shut up! - That's what you are. Shut up! [SELLERS] My lawyer will clear up this mess for me, but you, you piece of shit, you are gonna rot in jail. Oh really? You think I'll go down by myself? I'll take everyone down with me. Yeah. Old pal. [SOARING MUSIC PLAYING] You really want to meet Nancy? I can call the whole thing off if you're not ready. It's okay. I'll keep any open mind. [SENTIMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] I guess I can't ask for more than that. I'm okay, Ma. - You sure? - Yeah. Thank you. - Another drink? - I got it. It's fine. Thank you. [CAR APPROACHING] [BLOWS] Hey, Ticky boy. Ticky boy. Where's the chow? Look at you. You're gonna embarrass Baboo. - What? - Come. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Good day, Mrs. Chetty. This is Nancy.

You're so brave and such a good friend. Uh, thanks. You can be my boyfriend if you want. Nah, that's okay. I don't need a girlfriend. But we can be friends if you want. Yeah. I think that's better. Hey, larney. [IMITATING MICHAEL JACKSON] Hee hee. [HUMMING "BAD" BY MICHAEL JACKSON] ♪ Ice, ice, baby ♪ ♪ Let's go, hammer time ♪ Hee hee. Who's old-fashioned now? Hee hee. [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING AND LAUGHING] Hey. - When was the last time you held my hand? - [TUTS] [MUSIC FADES] [TENDER MUSIC PLAYING] [TICKY] Your old man looks happy, ek sê. [HAROLD] Yeah. I miss my mom so much sometimes. Maybe that's why I went all cuckoo on you with this Leila story. The good news is that the white lady is not so ugly close-up. [BOTH LAUGH] Ticky. I'm really sorry for being an ass. Leila can be your girlfriend. I don't mind. What is wrong with you, ek sê? Look at all the women in my life. Do you really think I need more aggravation? - You have a point. - [TICKY] Yes, I do. And if you parked long enough the other night, when Leila tried all that funny business, you'd have seen me push her in the pool. Aiybo! No you didn't. [TICKY] Yes, I did, brah. Let's make a blood pact, to never let a girl come between us, ever. Blood pact? Cutting and all? Yeah, now that you say it like that, maybe it's not such a good idea. [TICKY] Let's make a pact... with these. I was saving them for your old man for calling me old-fashioned and all. But I can let that go. Okay, let's do it. - Bros for life. - Bros for life.
