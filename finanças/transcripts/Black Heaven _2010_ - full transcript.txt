Sam! Sam! Wait for me! Come on. C'mon, Marion! What's the time? Shit, he'll be furious! What's up? My dad's due back, and the place is a mess. Can I come with you? All right. What are you doing? What's up? Marion? Gaspard? You'll be late. That's your fauit. Sam? Yes. Sam, it's Dragon. I wanted to hear your voice. I was wrong to call. - What are you doing? - Looking. We have to return it. Or you keep it. Shit, they're back. I'll call you. What did you do? You ate her out. Ignore him. I won't waste my breath. Did she blow you or not? Ludo, you've got a dirty mouth! Blowing isn't dirty. It is. Your language too. Cut it out! - I just want to... - Enough! I'm not answering. What did you do, then? You just kissed? You're in love? - Ludo... - Yeah. Shut the hell up. See that, I got him! You're in love! That true? It's why they didn't fuck. Conversation over, thanks. You're a sly one. Coming to Momo's with us? I can't. I promised to repaint the hallway. Repaint it? Need a hand? Over my dead body! You can ask Marion instead. Gaspard... Okay, We're going. See you. I want the smutty details! See you! "Sorry I called. I'll meet you as arranged. From : Dragon" Did you reply? No. Any old messages? You want me to check? Yes. Hold on. I'll read them. "Insomnia. I feel weird. I'd like to talk to you." "No, I'm not scared." "With you, yes. I think I love you." That's all? I'll check what she sent. "Meet me on Black Hole." - What's Black Hole? - No idea. Another one... "Saturday, 6:00 pm. at the chapel. "We'll get what we need. "We'll be together." Signed Sam. When was it sent? This afternoon at 13:00. Saturday's tomorrow. I'm free. You want to go? What's the time? 18:30. Maybe it's too late. Want to go back? No. I know what Black Hole is. You do? What is it? Guess. Tell me, what is it? It's just an online game. - You played? - No, you have to buy the DVD. That's Sam. That's Dragon. They've never mot. How can you be sure? I don't know, hut I'm sure. I'll follow him. You're sure? You hear me? I'm following him. He's got rolls of tape. What for? No idea. He's in the plumbing aisle now. He's looking at pipes. He's picked one. It's a sort of plastic tube. Hold on. I can't see him. - Okay? - Come on. We lost them. Disappointed? No, it was nice. That's true. It's so wonderful, Marion. I love you. Don't say it if it's not true or it's... it's what? It's bad luck. It's true, I swear. I wouldn't lie to you. It's the truth. What's that? It's not locked! He's dead! Seo's breathing! - What? - someone's there! Anybody there? Is anybody there? That's my dad. Good evening. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. Need a ride? I have to get the scooter back. Marion says your parents are away. They're in Spain with my sister. Don't worry. It's a shock, but we'll be okay. All right. We'll fall asleep and float in the clouds. Give me plenty. Here. Tell me you love me. I love you, Sam. We're going far away. To the Black Beach. Yeah. To the Black Beach. We're going away together. Isn't working a drag while we hang out? No, I love being in a booth as cars pass by! It must be hell. You learn a lot. Yeah? Such as? Some people are nice; others aren't. Great discovery! They're two different species. Nice ones are always pleasant. The others, always nasty and dumb. I'm a nice guy. No way! You're the kind who'd try to grab my hand. Some do that? Some even flash you their dick at the tollgate Are you nuts? I'm not like that. You are. You think with your cock! Here you go. Bang on time. Marion's great. I mean it. She's cute, friendly... Smart too. Yeah, dead smart. She's a great girl. I think so too. I hope the four of us stay friends. How do you mean? Well, now Marion and you are together. That changes nothing. How do you run? I'm looking for a girl. This is the place. But watch out. 2/3 of the girls are guys. Some are cute, though. I know her already. What's her username? Sam, I think There are loads of Sams. Where does she hang out? No idea. You don't have a clue, huh? Answer. Don't be afraid. Go on, answer. Want to fuck her? I understood. What do I say? Say yes. You'll see. Too expensive. She's nuts! Shit... Shit! She killed you? She sent me to Purgatory. A real drag, hours to got back. Sorry. Hey, that's life. Do you like it? What shall we do? You choose. Come see something at my place? Yeah, okay. You can even sleep over. No. My dad won't let me. I know him. He freaks out. What a drag! He won't let me. What did he say? That I have to go home. He's a pain. He's totally anal! Gaspard! - Can I have a word? - What for? I just want a word. Leave us, please. She thinks I'm an old fart. She never says that. Whatever. She asked to sleep at your place. I said no. I don't think it's a good idea. What do you think? About... is it a good idea for her to stay the night? I don't know. Yes. I'm her father. A father protects his daughter. You must be reasonable. - We are roasonable. - Good. You mustn't worry. We're not kids. We're careful. Careful? Careful of what? Everything. You think she's in danger? You're talking ahout contraception? It's not just ahout contraception. Marion is a lot more fragile than she seems. She's very fond of you. What ahout you? Are you fond of her? Yes, of course. I have nothing against you. I'm sure you're a fine young man. But I rememher being young once. I don't want Marion to suffer. - You understand? - I think so. So think ahout it. We're going far away. To the Black Beach. Yeah. To the Black Beach. We're going away together. Ludo, shit! Okay if I take a break? What for? I need to pick something up. Something? Coming up with me? - No. - Thanks, Yann.

Second on the right. Sorry! I should have closed the door. Stay, I don't mind. What's your name? Gaspard. Are you a pal of Vincent's? No, I came with a friend to see Samos Samos is a jerk. All Vincent's pals are jerks. I know you. What? Where from? I'm the one who found you at the quarry. Come with me. Want to hear the most beautiful song ever? They'll wonder where I am. Forget them. Close your eyes. It's better with your eyes closed. You saw it? - What? - My tattoo. You were looking at it before, right? Yes. Want to see it? Know what it means? Heaven. Touch it if you want.

It's chilly here. You can get rich with me. Filthy rich. Thanks, I don't need money. Of course you do! Everyone needs money! You can't stay naked like that. Do you know a girl called Sam? Sam?

A now member? I never saw you. I'm not a member. How did you get in? Sit down. How do you know me? Dragon told me ahout you. You know Dragon? I sold him a pet. We hit it off. That's what you do? You sell pets? Yes. What did Dragon say ahout me? Not a lot. That you sang well. That's all? He said he wanted to die with you. He told you that? I never saw him again. He's dead. What's your name?

Yeah, sure. Will I see you tonight? Yes. Gaspard? Are you listening? I'm listening. Come at midnight. The guy you killed will block his card. Use the emergency door. The password is "butterfly" - I'll come over, then. - Butterfly. What? Yes, come over. Okay, see you. Take care. Gordon? Emergency door. Midnight. Butterfly. Got some fancier clothes. I have a reputation to keep up. - Yann and Ludo aren't helping? - Not today. What's up? Hold on. It's me. No, I'm at Ingrid's. She asked me to sleep over. You don't trust me? Want to talk to her mum? Okay, tomorrow at midday. Sure you don't want to talk to her mum? Okay, see you tomorrow. You'll got messed up. Don't care. - Gaspard... - Yes? I want to make love with you. That was beautiful. I'd like to take you somewhere. Know the Black Beach? No. It's where you go when you die here. - Purgatory? - Yes. Already been there? I thought people stayed away from it. It's my favorite place. Want to go with me? We'd need to die, then? Yes. Follow me. I like it better here. I'd like to disappear and stay here for good. Dragon liked this place too. He wanted to disappear as well. We'd decided to do it together. I should have died with him, but two kids found us, and I'm still here. Are you mad at them? Who? The kids who found you. Yes. We never asked them to. I saw the boy again recently. I intrigue him. I think he's in love. Why do you say that? I can see it in his eyes. Do you like him? No. He's too naive. Next time, I'll die. You'll try again? Yes. Gordon? Ask me to do something for you. What do you mean? Put me to the test. Tell me what to do in real life, and I will. In real life? Yes, the first thing you think of. I'll do it. For you. Kiss that naive boy. What? Kiss him and sleep with him. Sleep with him? Yes. That turns you on? Yes. Okay, I'll do it. I'll tell you ahout it. Now what will you do for me? Want me to do something? Got a girlfriend? Someone you're dating? No. I'm married. Do you love her? Why do you want to know? - Can't you guess? - No. I'd like you to hurt her. Does that shock you? But you'll do it. For me. Coming for a swim? Want to take your brother to the pool? Yes, he'd like that. He keeps asking ahout you. - He does? - Yeah. That's cold! It's cold? Hi. Hello. Want to come swimming with me? Actually, I'm not alone. Too bad. Know Fallen Stone Bay? I'll be there, if you change your mind. All right. Who was it? The woman next door. What would you do to hurt someone? What do you mean? If you had to, what would you do? I don't understand. If you had to hurt your brother, what would you do? I'd never hurt him. What is this? You never wanted to hurt someone you love? No. Never crossed your mind? No, I don't think so. That's your problem. My problem? You're naive. It's naive not to want to hurt others? Funny how you want to be perfect. You think you're pure and beyond reproach, but you're just naive Where's Gaspard going? You're hurting me! I'm sorry. You came in the end. You're not going in? Where's Marion? Looking after her brother. Come on, no one's here. What a bastard! He's something else. What the hell? She looks so peaceful, doesn't she? Get out of here. Did you hear me? Get out. So? Did you sleep with her? What? You can tell me. Audrey said she wanted to. Was it good? None of your business. It is my business. I don't want you to hurt her. I won't That's true. You're a good kid. The savior. She needs help. You want to help her? To do what? Two years ago, I realized she was online more and more. She'd chat to nutters who wanted to waste themselves. When I found out, I chatted to them too. One day, I was online with a guy and I told him be was right. It didn't make sense for him to go on. He didn't deserve to live. He shouid die. I thought he'd tell me to fuck off, but instead, he started crying. And he thanked me. We chatted, and I told him to jump under a train, at a tunnel near his place. I gave him the date and time. You killed him. He killed himself. You've no idea how many guys want to die. Most can't manage it but they're obsessed by it. Know what they want? Someone to help them. Someone to give them the little push they need. That's what they want. A little push. Not just losers or depressives. Some of them seem to be fine. - What? - Someone's there. Sam, we need to talk! What's wrong? - Your brother was at my place. - My brother? Yes, your brother. Vincent. How do you know him? I'm Gaspard. Silly me. I should have known. He was at the quarry when you were with Dragon. He was in the bushes watching. Did you know? Yes. Tell me what's going on. I can't. Is be making you do it? He made you use the camera? No, it was my idea. As a souvenir for him. No, he said be makes people commit suicide. It turns him on seeing them die. Go to the police, Audrey. No, I can't. You have to. I can't! Why not? Because... I'm his slave. What are you saying? Without him, I'm lost. He loves mo so much. That's not true. You don't need him. He manipulates you. He's toxic. He hurts you. Go to the police, or I will. It's true, he is mad. He's driving me mad. I'm ending all this. I'll waste myself. For good. No, we can talk, see each other. - It's no use. - It is. I want to see you, see you face to face for real. Okay? Audrey, say you agree. Okay. Can you come into town? Why not come here? To your place? I want to avoid him. Vincent? He isn't here. Whero is he? In Nice with Samos and his gang. What if be comes back? He's spending the night there. Are you afraid? I understand. Forget it. No, wait. I'll come. You will? I'll be waiting. Kiss me, Gordon. Come on. Make yourself beautiful. Found someone? Yeah. What's his name? Gordon. Gordon? You like him? Yes. Hi. I saw Marion. She's in a bad way. She's worried for you. She says you've changed. You're not with Ludo? No, Ludo's on a loop ahout his sexual exploits. Talk ahout young, dumb, and full of cum. He's a pain in the ass. What's happening to us? The four of us got on so well. What went wrong? I don't know. You should see Marion. Too late. - Why? - Audrey needs me. Audrey? That's bullshit. You can't understand. Marion's a thousand times better! I have to go. Give me my scooter keys. Now? Yes. Now. No! Leave it on. Hold me in your arms. Hold me tight. Tighter Tighter Audrey... You? What's wrong? Nothing. I don't want you to die... I don't want you to die. The savior wanted to screw her? Why did you come? It wasn't to save her. That's bullshit. Know why you're here? I'll tell you. You're like the others. You want to die with her. Get up. Open the door. Open the door! Audrey! Stop! Stop! Vincent! I'm going away, Vincent. Get down. Stay right there. Don't be a fool. Get down. No. I'm sick of it. Come on. No. I'm going to the Black Beach. For good. Don't talk crap. The Black Beach doosn't exist. Yes, it does. Marion... You have to get up. Your friend Gaspard is in trouble. I'll wait downstairs. Where are you going? Stay here. Marion... I wasn't lying at the quarry when I said I loved you. Maybe I ruined everything, but I wasn't lying.
