(gentle flute music) Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. (soft goofy tense music) (man whistling) - Here's a dry towel for you. - Thank you, darling. (man humming) You know, dear, there's a lot of jobs that I've never even tried here. I mean, while there's life there's hope, eh? - Unless we take this boat we'll never go. I'm sure we'll find something back in Dublin. - Oh yes, we've got our relatives there all right. At least we've got your relatives. We've got your old father. He'll be there on the quayside. - Hurry up Paulie, it's after eight o'clock. Well, anyway at least he'll help us. - Help us to what? Anyhow I don't need their help anymore. Ah the junk back home, they're on Chinese boxes. Whatever you start out as you probably end up as. There's no rags to riches over there, you know. - There wasn't any here, was there? God knows we tried. Now look Ginger, you promised. - All right, all right. I still say a man with ambition can be something. It's not every job that suits him you know. (Ginger singing) - Do you want an egg with your breakfast? - Yes, fried. There must be a law of averages, kitten. My luck's due for a change. - But Ginger, we can't afford to stay. Oh come on now, straight after breakfast you'll go downtown and collect those boat tickets, just as you promised. - All right my lovely old girl. - You promise? - Right-o. (Ginger humming) (razor buzzing) - Daddy - What pet? (shushes) - Daddy, can you lend me two dollars? - Two dollars, that's a lot of money. - Well there's a skating party this afternoon and all the kids are going. - Does your mommy know? - She said it was too much money. - So it is. Oh, let's see what we got here then. Two dollars. All right, here you are. - Thanks daddy. - Hey. Enjoy yourself. (flute playing) (people talking in background) (speaking French) (soft whimsical classical music) - Hello there. Mr. B. Let me give you a bit of a hand. Oh heavy as dirt. (speaking French) You do all the dirty work, don't you, Mr. Beaulieu? Why don't you get your old woman out of bed in the mornings? (whimsical music) (whimsical classical music) (horn honking) - Why if isn't Sir Ginger o Coffey, himself. - Hello there, Joe. This is very nice. Is it new? - Thank you, just off the boat. - Oh yes. - Hey, I hear you're taking her back home. - Oh women. Always telling your affairs all over the town. Always getting it wrong in the heat of the hunt. No, no. We're not going home. - Good. As a matter of fact, I was gonna call you. There's some talk about opening down at our place. - Oh what's that then? - Desk man. - desk man? - Its an editorial, like a sub editor. - Editor? Yes, oh editor. Well that sounds interesting. - Wait a minute, nothing definite but if anything happens, I'll give you a buzz. - Oh thank you. - And uh, give my love to Vera. - Yes, I will. Drop in on us anytime. So long, Joe. Mind how you go now. (soft whimsical classical music) (men talking in background) - [Man] Should be going downtown. - Hey, can I help you? - Oh no, no. Just looking for someone. (man talking in background) - Ginger. - [Man] The demon bowler. Six games straight. - Come on in. How are things with you, Ginger? - Oh perfect. Stan, I wonder if you could spare me 50 bucks for a week or two. - Oh. I can spot you 20. - Oh that's a good man, yourself. I'll pay you back in a day or two. I got this job. I'm gonna change my whole plan of attack. - How come? - Well I got to lower the old sights a little. - I told you, you got to start small over here. - Oh they all say that, right enough. - Mr. Mountain? - Yeah? Okay, Ginger if you're just looking for something to tide you over I might be able to help out here. - No, no. Frankly this diaper racket is not in my line, you know? - It wasn't in my line either when I started out here. I'm doing all right. - Yes, of course its just uh-- - Just you're too stuck up to get into a uniform and get a little dirt between your fingers. - No, no its not that. To tell you the truth, I've got something very interesting coming up, very interesting indeed. Oh well, so long, Stan. Thanks a million. I'll pay you back in a week, I promise. So long, now. - Okay, good luck. - Morning, Mr. Labelle, how are you? Morning, Mrs. Pinette. - Morning. - Nice to see you there. (man mumbling in background) morning. - [Man] Mr. Coffey? - Morning. - Quite a pile here. - Yes, well I've been run off my feet these last months. - Lot of interviews. The three jobs we have got you, you've walked off all three. XO Computer-- - Well uh that was, when I first come over, that was just a bit of a stop gap. - Stan Office Supplies three weeks. - Yes that was a sort of disaster of a place. - And Emerson paper box-- - Well that was the best one of the lot of them but the trouble there was that there was no real chance of advancement. I mean a man of my type, you've got to have the right class of a job. - Yes. I see here you've been applying for public relations positions. - Yes. - You don't seem to have any experience in that sort of thing. - In the army. - Yes, the Irish army. Yes but look, you didn't finish university. You can't get a public relations job nowadays without a degree. - Well, I'll be straight with you, Mr. Uh? - O'Donnell. - Mr. O'Donnell. You see, I'm going to give this country another chance. Now I'm gonna bet on Canada. I'm a bit of a gambler, you know? Well that being the case, I would be prepared to accept a more junior position than I'd have at home. So, so you make me an offer. Well. If there's nothing in public relations, how bout sales? - Well I can check. Mr. Coffey. There's an opening at Canada Nickel for assistant for the sales manager but they'd like a man with some experience. - Ah, assistant. I suppose most of those assistants are just glorified office boys running errands and so man. No you see, with a man of my age, there's no future to that. - Well, that leaves us with perhaps some sales training program. - Would there be a chance of promotion though, do you think? - There's always a chance of promotion. - Yes, well in that case, I mean there's nothing to nickel you couldn't study up half an hour in the encyclopedia, no? No, if I could become manager. Would you get on the phone and make an appointment? (soft whimsical music) I have an appointment with Mr. Hawkins. - Through there, sir. - Thank you. - Yes. Yes, that's here. That's all in here. Bye, bye. Mr. Coffey. - How do you do, sir? - You're 39, Mr. Coffey, is that correct? - Yes. - Well we specifically asked for a junior. Somebody we could train, bring along, promote if he works out. - Yes, well in my case, you know, most of my experience has been on the other side of the water. So maybe I'll start lower down on the ladder, learn the ropes. - Yes, well you see we have a pension plan here and the older the man is when he joins the firm the more expensive it is on those already in the plan. You know how these things work. - Yes. Suppose you leave me out of the pension plan? - No. That's not possible. We need a junior. (whimsical music) I'm sorry. (tense reflective music) (upbeat whimsical music) (man shouts) - Mr. Coffey. - Yes? - [Woman] The rent for next week was due this morning. - [Ginger] All right, well you have it in the morning without fail. (woman speaks French) - That's a promise. (speaking French) - [Vera] Haven't you paid her yet? - No, dear. I'll pay her tomorrow. - Didn't you go to the bank? Where were you all day? I missed you. - I went down to the YM, I had a workout and a bit of a swim. Where's Paulie? - She went to her skating party. Lord knows where she gets the money from. Have you got the tickets? - Oh don't worry about that. (mumbles). Get a needle. The old buttons come off my jacket. - All right but it can wait for a minute. I've got something for you. I thought you might need a bit of cheering up. Let's not have a wake over past mistakes. Here's to dear, dirty old Dublin. - How'd you manage this? - Oh I manage. (laughs) - Here's to Dublin. Oh put down your old glass. Want to give you a kiss. Come on, lets see your face. You know, you're more pretty now than you ever were? - Thank you. - Would we be all right? - We'll be alone till six. - I'll shut the door. You know, you're a good wife. You want some? - No, thanks. (upbeat jazzy music) (laughing) - Ginger? - Yes, dear? - Did it say on the tickets what time the boat train leaves South Hampton? - I didn't notice. - Well would you take a look? - Yes. - I'd like to write the time and mail it to mother. - You know where I was today? I was in the office of the Employment Commission. - What about the tickets? (sighs) - Its no good going about the bloody tickets because I didn't get them. - You didn't get them? - No. Its a terribly expensive country this, you know? - You spent the money? You've spent the passage money. Oh god. You must of been lying to me for weeks. Letting me pack, writing those letters. Ginger, you promised you wouldn't touch a penny of that money. - Kitten, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. - You're sorry, what are we gonna do? - I'll get a job. - You'll get a job? Oh Ginger, face facts. - I am facing the facts. - Oh no you aren't. When have you ever lasted in any job? What have you ever done in any job but dream about what you'd do with the next one. - Oh come on now, that's not fair at all. - Oh no? Wasn't Canada your last fancy? The one country we'd all make our fortune. I'm as much to blame for encouraging you. What are we gonna do about Paulie? - Oh, she'll be all right. Nevermind about Paulie. - She'll be all right? (phone ringing) Oh don't touch me! Oh why did you have to touch that money? - Oh stop making such a bloody drama out of it. Its no the end of the world, for god's sake. I'll get another job. I just had a lot of bad luck. That's all. Nobody can help that. I just had a-- - Oh don't you talk anymore. After all the things that we've done and the things that we planned. What about all that packing I did today? I even sent off that big trunk with all our summer clothes. Oh I'm sick of your lies and schemes. I don't care what you do from now on. - Hello? - [Vera] I'm sick of your filthy (mumbles) and your alibis. - Please be quiet, Vera. (screaming in background) For goodness sake! Keep quiet, you sound like a bloody fish wife. Hello? Oh. Oh yes, Joe, yes. Well I'd be, that be very interesting, yes. How's my grammar and punctuation... I was at the University of Dublin there for a bit, you know? Yes. Well when I could go down and see... Oh I could. Hang on a minute, dear. Oh well, yes I'll come down there right away. I'll get dressed up, be right down there, Joe. Thank you very much. Dear, you want to stay in Canada, don't you? - Oh sure, daddy. What's up? - What's up? I'll tell you what's up. I think my lucks changed. I think that's what's up. Its the Montreal Tribune. They want an editor down there, some editor or something. - Since when have you known anything about editing a newspaper? - Oh he said I, it doesn't matter about experience. He said I wasn't to worry about that. - Oh well I'd worry if I were you. - Oh its not you that's worrying. There's an old Joe McGlade. He's giving me a bit of encouragement. What are you doing? Trying to drag me right down. Anyway, I said my luck would change. I'm going down there right away. - Why'd you have to bring Paulie into it? You always bring that child in whenever you have half a chance. - Vera, please stop carrying on, would you? - Ginger. I want to come with you. - There's no need for you to come. - Oh yes there is. - All right, dear. All right. Dear, I'm sorry. Apart this state, you know, that may be the very sort of job that I've been waiting for. Come on, now darling. Now hurry it up. Let's get down there. Uh excuse me, could you tell me where I'd find Joe McGlade? - Back there in the sport section. - Hello, Joey. - Ah, Ginger. How's the boy? - Very well. - With you in a second. All right, here's the bit. I'll give you a good build up, then you take it from there. - Yes, but what am I gonna say, Joe? - Like five minutes, okay? Well tell them about that, the PR work with the Irish whiskey company. - Oh yes, I'll do that. - No, no. Better still. You worked for a Dublin newspaper. - What, I never worked for any Dublin newspaper. - Well do you want the job or don't you? - I want it very much but I can't just go in there-- - all right, all right. Now wait a minute. Do as I say. That will it own thick, the employers never check. The main thing is to get the job. The rest is easy. (muffled distant talking) - Good, make them to page one. (mumbling) - All right. - Okay, away with you. - About that vacancy at the proofread desk. This is Mr. Coffey. - How do you do, sir? - (mumbles) Irish, experienced man. I thought about (mumbles). - Is your paper away yet? - Oh in a few minutes. - What do you mean few minutes? We got a paper to get out here. Get back to work. Cabbage. You. What's your schooling? - Well sir, I uh, I went to Dublin to the university to take an arts degree and I was in the army sir. After that was public relations. - Public relations? You know what that is? That's pulling the wool over the public's eyes. - That's very good, sir. I must bear that one in mind. - What is it you do? - A bit of journalism. - What paper? - Yes, uh. Irish Times. - Good paper? - Yes. - How long were you there? - About five years. - I knew it. Told you it be coming in. - That's right, Mr. Mac. - Why did you come to Canada? - Oh I came out here as a public relations man, representing an Irish firm. - What sort of firm? - Whiskey. - Scotch whiskey? - No, Irish, sir. - No wonder you're out of a job then. Did you work on the front desk of the Times? - Oh, oh yes. Yes I was there, sir, yes. - Too bad. Wasting good money paying these loafers. Get me ten, my laddie. When did you say you worked there? - About two years ago there, sir. - Ted. When you worked in the Irish Times, did you ever a sub by the name of, what's your name? - Coffey, sir. - Coffey, oh two years ago. Wait, wait a minute? What was the name of foreign editor in your day? - I'm afraid I can't remember, sir. - Okay, Ted. Doesn't matter. If you'd been a scotch, you'd of come in here with your references in your hand. But you carry nothing but that silly hat and a lot of cheek. Let me tell you, laddie. There isn't an Irishman born could pull the wool over my eyes. - I have to apologize for taking up your time. - Are you're hard up for a job? Tell the truth now. Spell me parallel. - P-A-R-A-double L-E-L. - Come into the office. (tense dramatic music) (muffled shouting) - Excuse me, I'm looking for Mr. Hickey? How do you do? My names Coffey. - New man? - Yes, how did you know? - Get so you can tell. Hitler send you? - [Coffey] Who? - Hitler, the boss. - Oh yes, (laughs). - Here's the bible. Make sure you learn it. - Oh, thank you very much. - For what? This job. You'll find the night shift down at the eagle tavern. - Right. - Hey. Look for Foxy. Has a crutch. - Oh I'll do that. - Good luck, fella. - I'm starting in half an hour. So don't wait up for me. - You got the job? - Isn't it grand? Now I've got to go and see a man, you see, so just don't you wait up. - I'll leave something out cold for you. Ginger, how much are you getting a week? - 110. - Is that true now? - Cross my heart. Here's your first kiss from an editor. - [Joe] Hello, Vera. - Hi, Joe. - How's my girl tonight? - Oh I'm fine, thanks. - Are you out of your mind? I hear you took a job as a proofreader. - Yes, well its only temporary. As you know, I was going to speak to you about that. - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll see you later. Proofreader? (scoffs) - Well now dear. I'll go and see that lad. Spoke to you. - Ginger. What job are you getting? - Well there's uh, there's a sort of a training scheme, you know the usual thing. You start as proofreader but you work your way up. - Proofreader? I thought you said you were going to be an editor? - No I didn't, I didn't say that exactly. I didn't have a chance to tell you exactly what it was. - How much money are you getting? - 75 for a start. - 75? Is that the truth? - Word of honor. - I suppose we can manage on 75. We'll have to. - Of course we can, darling. - Oh god, Ginger! Can I believe you? Must I go upstairs and check? - You'll do nothing of the sort. Now come away. You're not going to press me in front of all these people. All right, 45 dollars a week. - 45 dollars a week? We can't live on 45 dollars a week in this country. - Well its just for a start. They're going to promote me. They'll make me into a reporter. - Can you just once in your life please tell me the truth? - Look its not my fault we're in this mess, you know? Its all the fault of your pal Joey. - Blame him. Yes just blame anybody. You're never at fault, are you? Well who spent the passage money? - Keep your voice down, Vera. Here, here, darling, I promise you. Its going to work out. - How much money do we have? - Oh we got about 40 dollars. - Give me 20. - Right now? - Right now. - All right love, all right. There you are. Half of my worldly wealth for the endow. (somber classical music) (sobbing) What's the matter, dear? (somber classical music) (sobbing) - Ah that's just you damn English. We have our own culture. - Excuse me. Would you be Mr. Fox? - What bloody culture? In this country the surest way to become an immortal-- - Hey, Foxy. - oh, shut up. Is to have a hospital wing named after you or better still, a bridge. - Foxy, Foxy. - What is it? - Someone to see you. - What the hell do you want? - Well the name is Coffey. - New man? - Yes, that's right. - Well sit down. - Oh thank you very much. (laughing) - How do you do? How do you do? - My names Kenny. - Oh, Mr. Kenny. - Do you speak French? - Well I can (speaks French) enough for a meal, you know? - Oh you're all the same. We learn English. You never learn French. - All right new man, drink up. You're behind. - Oh, cheers. - Get it down. - Oh yes. - [Man] Draw a couple more, George. - That's very good. - Drink up, new man. Did you know this is Canada's century. That's right. That's what they say. It isn't Americas, not even Russia's. The 20th century belongs to Canada. - That's very interesting. - I've heard it 50 times. - Go on, drink up. - Well, yes, cheers. - Go on now, drink up. Come on. Drink up. Come on, drink up, then. Come on. - Oh no, no, no. To hell with this, carry on. - What's the matter? - I mean, what are we doing here, guzzling like a lot of pigs, I mean what's the rush? (laughing) - Good question, new man. He answers ours, booze is not his problem, hey lads? - I think his problem is women. - Now why would I have to have a problem? - Every proofreader has a problem. Else why would he be the proofreader? You know what these lads problem is, don't you, huh? - Lousy gimp. - Identification with mummy. Its classic. - Money, that was my problem. Gambled it all away. Moneys everybody's problem, right fella? - Shut up. Let me explain the facts of life to our immigrant brother. Tonight you'll be a proofreader, right? - Oh no, that's not only temporary. Mr. McGregor, he said that I, I should be made a reporter. - McGregor? (overlapping shouting) Readers, that's what he needs. - We're always short a proofreader. - That's why he promised you to be a reporter. Just to suck you in. - Oh its only temporary. - Sure, sure. Hitler would have taken an Eskimo tonight if one walked in off the straight. - Tonight you will become a proofreader. You will cast a cold eye on all the news. Those are just finger exercises. We don't care about mistakes in those, eh do we? - Advertisements. - Exactly, advertisements cost money. They pay, compere? - Oh yes, I see that. - No you don't see. The Montreal Social page. Get the names right there, too. They belong to important families. They belong to the people who buy the advertisements. - Yes, I do see. - No, you don't see. Oh go on slaves. Let's go. Remember this jack, you're just a damn galley slave from now on. (speaking French) five dollars 60. No need to leave a big tip. - Oh yes. (machinery whirring) - Who let these pass? Who let these pass? Detective, not defective! - (mumbles), Mr. Mac. - I'm checking my man. - If your man can't do the work, we have union men that can. You hold us up and I'll take this up with the grievance committee. (huffing) (laughing) (somber classical music) - Vera? (soft music) - [Man] Mr. Coffey! - Ah, merci, merci. Au revoir, au revoir. (speaking French) (whimsical classical music) (speaks French) (bells tolling) Paulie! - Daddy. - Where did you two go last night? (shushes) Where's mummy? - Daddy, I'm late. - Apple, I've got to find out where she is. - She said I wasn't to tell you. (bell rings) - Where are you staying? What's mummy doing now? - She went to look for a job. - What job? - I don't know. Look daddy, when I see her this afternoon, I'll tell her you want to talk to her, okay? Will you be at home? - No, I had to move. - Paulie. - Its only temporary. I'll be at the YMCA. That's where I'll be. Now you tell her to call me. Now don't forget that. - I know, daddy, I promise, daddy. I have to go. (somber classical music) - Well hello Madge, its me, its Ginger. Yes dear, yes. Uh Madge, uh. Did you by any chance hear or see Vera today? No. No, no, no. There's nothing wrong with her. No, I just wondered. (somber classical music) Excuse me, excuse me. My name is Coffey. I'm in 327, yes, that's right. I'm expecting a phone call. Would you let me know? - Right-O. (people talking in background) - Hello, Joey. - Ah, Ginger. How's the proofreading caper? - Oh, that's only temporary. McGregor said they're gonna promote me and make me a reporter, you know? Listen, Joey, did you happen to hear from Vera by any chance? - No. - Uh, well. Had a bit of a tiff last night. You know how these things are. Females always complaining. You're best off being a bacheelor. Still, you know what women are like. - Yeah, does any man? - Joey. If you do happen to hear from her, will you let me know, please? - Yeah. Ginger. You know I have to be a friend of Vera's, too. - What's that supposed to mean, exactly? - It means if she doesn't want to see you, that's her business. - Who said she doesn't want to see me? - Does she? - Hey, Coffey. There's a call for you. I had it transferred out to the hall. - Oh thank you very much. Kenny, would you be kind enough to finish this for me? Vera? Oh, oh its you Paulie, oh yes. - I told her, daddy, but she said she didn't want to see you. - Oh well now listen, you go back there and you tell her to phone me. Do you hear? - Look, daddy, this isn't my fault. - Oh I know. Listen, I got a good job now. I'm going to be an editor. All our troubles are over. You love your daddy, don't you? - Oh daddy, don't be so soppy. - Where are you staying? - [Paulie] Mommy said not to tell you. - Oh please, pet. You must tell me. Come on, tell your daddy, pet. - [Paulie] We're at Joe's. - Joe McGlade's? You get your mother out of there this minute. - I told you, she's not here. - You tell her you're not staying the night there. Do you hear? - Ginger. Hitler! - Hey, you! You missed a (mumbles). Back to work you black of eyes pack of loafers. - [Woman] Micheal Francis. Micheal Francis. - Where's McGlade, please? - Gone to a hockey game. - When will he be back? - Oh he won't be back tonight. Said he'd phone his story in. (horns honking) - Is that you, McGlade? Its me, Ginger. McGlade! (door buzzes) Why couldn't you phone? I've been waiting in all day. Its all right, darling, I'm sorry. Its only me. Now go back to sleep. - [Vera] Its Joe McGlade you're looking for. He's not here. He stayed with friends. Offered to lend us his place until I get a job. Where did you expect us to go on 20 dollars, a hotel? - [Ginger] What do you mean go? - I'm getting a job and I'm going to save up enough money to get Paulie and me back to Ireland. You can do whatever you like from now on. - There's no need to be getting a job. - If you'd let me take a job the first week we came out here, we wouldn't be in this mess now. - We're not in any mess. - Aren't we? Ginger. I want a divorce. - A divorce? Are you serious? You want a divorce? What's your holy mother going to say about the sin of a divorce? - Don't you preach religion at me. You that hasn't walked through a church door since the day we came out here. You never were a Catholic. You were too selfish to give god or anyone else the time of day. Oh you may think I'm like you now and I am but you changed me, Ginger. What I am now its what you made me. So don't you talk sin to me. Don't you dare. - Kitten. I never knew how much I loved you until today. I never knew how much I'd miss you. - Oh you'd miss a servant if she looked after you for 15 years. That's not love. - Oh come on, now. I'll bet you a slap up dinner and a brand new frock-- - Ha, a brand new frock. I could stock a dress shop if I collected on half your bets. Oh god, Ginger, you never change. Just. Go away. Please. Go away. Paulie, go back to bed. - No. - Did you hear me, miss? - I'm not a child. You drag me out of our house last night. - Paulie please. Go back to bed, this is none of your business. - It is my business. If you're going to leave daddy, that doesn't mean I have to leave him. Daddy's in charge of me, too. - Yes, that's right I am in charge of you, too. Yes, you're right. Supposing I get a little flat just for the two of us? - On what, a proofreader's salary? - Yes, that's you all over, isn't it? You're always dragging me down. I can get two jobs, you know, I can have one in the daytime. How bout it? (mumble) its a deal. - Ginger? - Apple. - All right, daddy. - Good girl. My love, you go to bed. I'll pick you up the day after tomorrow. Yes, well. You're not as smart as you think you are. - You, you're bloody rotten. Using your own daughter. - Oh nevermind about that. Look, look Vera. You change your mind before I come to pick her up they'll be no recriminations. We'll forget all this ever happened. - Oh will we? - You think I can't get down in the muck and scramble for a living? You say I'll never get to be an editor. Well, I'll show you. Who are you, anyway, judging me, talking about love? Love isn't sleeping with the likes of Joe McGlade, Mrs. Coffey. - Out. Just get out. (radio in background) - There, you should get through that lot by 3:30. See you. (whimsical tense music) - Looking for something? - Uh number uh, number uh 24, Mrs. Moore. - You blind? Service entrance at the side. Take your stinking diapers up the back stairs. - All right. - Go on. - All right. (whimsical music) - Hello. - Oh no. (mumbles) Merci. (whimsical tense music) - Oh, Mr. Coffey. - Oh hello, madame. - Is everything all right? - Oh its grand, its grand, yes. - (speaking French) you like the apartment? - Oh its fine. - Mr. Coffey, if you don't mind, its usual thing you do that you pay the first month rent in advance. - Oh yes, well I've got no cash on me at the moment, you see, so I better get down there this afternoon and get an advance. - Don't forget now, huh? - No, no. Never fear madam, never fear. - Merci. (whimsical classical music) (horn honks) - Ginger, how's the boy. - So you're in the moving business now. I thought your specialty was letting out rooms. - I got a lot of sidelines. Samaritans my middle name. The big ones yours, Vera, isn't it? - Yes, that's right. - Where are you going? - Oh Joe's helping me move over to my place. As if it was any of your business. Here are those gloves, Paulie. - Very grand today, aren't we? Might I ask where you got your new coat? - You might not. - [Joe] Stop teasing the poor guy. She's got a job selling dresses. - Come on, Paulie. We'll go up stairs now to help you get settled in. - Will you stop treating me like an infant? - Well now, don't forget to call me at the store. I won't be getting my own telephone in for a couple days. - Mommy, your friend is waiting. - How bout a kiss then? I'll be bringing over her laundry next week. For god sake, look after her, Ginger. - Bye, Ginger. Bye, Paulie. (soft somber classical music) - Stan. - Thank you, Ginger. See you tomorrow. - What do you want? - Oh I wanted to see you, Mr. Brott. - What for? - Wanted to ask for an advance. - Look at this. Off nine percent. 15 percent of this route and he wants an advance. I'll tell you what's going to happen here. All you people are going to be out of a job, that's what. What's wrong? - Well uh, what do you mean? - Washing machines, we know about those. Disposal diapers, that's something else. But customers want them, eh? - No, sir. No they don't, as a matter of fact. - Oh yes they do. They always want something new. Customers are asking for them, right? - No, no, sir. - All right, wise guy. What do they ask for? - Well they ask for what you haven't got. - Like paper diapers, right? - Oh no sir, they ask for cribs and bassinets and things like that. You know especially people with only one kid. You know, they'd prefer to rent that, you know, sir. - Come in here. Shut the door. Sit down. What's your name? - J. F. Coffey, sir. - Uh huh, go on. - Well sir, I was wondering if you could see your way to letting me have an advance of 25 dollars-- - No, no, no. What you were saying about cribs and things. - Oh yes, well. I just said if you could rent things to people. Rent a crib, for instance. - You think up that name yourself? - What name? - Rent a crib. Its not bad. You don't look like a driver. - Oh well. No sir, no. That's only temporary. Its not the sort of thing I'm used to. I'm a new Canadian, you know. I've got two jobs. I got a night job, I work on the Tribune. - Two jobs? That's hard work. You like this country, Coffey? - [Ginger] Oh yes sir, I like it very much. A very go ahead sort of place. - Now this idea of yours. Rent a crib. You did think of the cleaning tie in? - Cleaning? - Pads and blankets and so on. - Oh yes, well. That would be essential, wouldn't it sir? - Its service that counts, right? - Right, sir. - 25 dollars. - Oh, thank you. Do you want me to sign for this, sir? - No, no, its a bonus. You have any more ideas like this one, come in. We'll talk more. - Well that's very nice of you indeed, sir. Well thank you very much for the bonus, sir. Thank you very much. Goodnight. (machinery whirring) (muffled shouting) Excuse me, sir. Sir, you may remember that you said I'd uh learn the Tribune's stye from proofreading. Well sir, I think I've got that now. - Good, nice to know someones working in this loafer's paradise. - Sir, is there any chance of that reporter job you spoke of? - Tell him how many men who want to become reporters, Clarence. - Dozen. - So we're not short of reporters at the moment, Coffey. You'll have to hang on awhile. - Oh well sir, I can't hang on awhile, you see, cause I'm a family man. - What do you get, 45? All right, all right. I'll give you 50. Make a note of that, Clarence. - Thank you very much, sir. But sir, I'd far rather have the promotion. - Did you ever hear such cheek? - But sir. - But what? - Sir, I want to know definitely when I can become a reporter. - Well how do I know? When I get a replacement for you on the proof desk, maybe next week. - Next week, sir, is that a promise? - What do you mean a promise? - Well sir, if its not a promise, I think it be best for me to resign right here and now, this very minute. - Hold your horses, hold your horses. I'm short staffed on the proof desk. All right. All right! - Oh thank you very much, sir. Sir you won't regret this, I assure you. Now is that a promise? Because if it is not a promise, I'm going to resign right here and now this very minute. Well you should of seen the look on his face. What do you think he said? Next week, he said, all right. All right. Is that a promise is it? Yes, he said its a promise. Now what about that then? - [Man] Clarence taking notes? - What are you two guys plotting? - Hi, Joe. How's the sporting life? - Oh fair to middle, fair to middle. Ginger. - He's gonna be a reporter. Hitler promised him. (laughs) - You believe that? - Who asked you for your opinion? - Now is that anyway to treat your best buddy? - I'm not your best buddy. - Oh come on, come off it. What's the matter with you? - Can't you get a woman of your own? - What do you mean by that? - You know bloody well what I mean by that. - If anyone just passes the time of day with his wife, he's glaring at you like a lunatic. - You leave my wife out of it. Come on, Kenny. You know you're the sort take advantage of anybody. - Now come on, fellas. Take it easy. - I'm taking it easy, I'm taking it easy. Its him. - Excuse me. (people talking in background) - [Man] He scored, daddy. - Hey you guys, wait for me! (laughing) - Oh, hi dad. Did you want something to eat? - Who were those boys? - Friends. - Friends? A lot of ill mannered little louts if you ask me. - Well nobody asked you. - Don't you (mumbles) to me, my girl. Don't you be rude. What's all this lipstick allover your face? - don't you hit me. - Take it off this very moment. - No. - Don't you say no to me. I'll give you another whack. - Don't you dare. - Put that right down. Paulie! Paulie. Paulie you come out of there this very moment. - [Paulie] You can't bully me the way you bullied mommy. I can run away, too. - Come right out of there. - [Paulie] Go away, go away. - Here you are, madam. Would you like to try it on now? - All right, I suppose so. - You look very good in it. - There's someone here to see you. - Who is it? - Some delivery man. (people talking in background) - Would you excuse me just a moment, madam? - Are you waiting on me or not? Zip me up, please. - Yes, of course. I'll be right back. What are you doing in that getup? - Well I, I have to come and see you about Paulie. - Is she sick? - No, no. She's not sick, she's... - Wait a minute. - [Woman] Third floor, ladies fashions. Going up. - Come on, I have to clear this. Well? - Well when I, when I came home last night, you know, three o'clock in the morning. Bunch of young hoodlums, they come bursting out of the house. I go in, Paulie's in there, she's painted up like an old woman. What are we going to do, dear? - Paulie must come and live with me. - Yes but she doesn't, she doesn't want to come and live with you. See what I was hoping dear-- - Oh I know what you were hoping. That I'd come back. Oh its just lovely for you, isn't it? Paulie doesn't want to live with me and I don't want to live with you. - [Woman] Third floor, ladies fashion. Going down. (people taking in background) - Ginger. Paulie must come and stay with me now. - Vera, they're going to make me a reporter on Friday. I'll get a lot more money, you know? I'll be able to give up this diaper thing. I'll have more time to look after Paulie. Could we not all be together until then? Just for a few days. Would you not come back just till Friday? - [Woman] Third floor, ladies fashions. Going up. (soft whimsical music) (machinery whirring) - Oh. Yes, well. So you've come after all then. I'm worn out, you know? Its a terrible drag, you know, that proof room. Its a great relief, you know, quiet in here. Well. Its grand to have you back, dear. - Ginger. - Yes? - You sleep there. - What? - Or I'll get up and leave. - Oh, suffering J. (groans) Vera. I do love you, you know? - You don't know what love is. - Oh yes. Yes, yes I do. - Go back to your own bed, Ginger. You ever think of anyone but yourself? (soft somber music) - Vera? Vera, I've made up my mind. If I don't get promoted on Friday, well I'll bow out. You can have Paulie. You can have your divorce, too. (somber classical music) Well isn't that unselfish of me, Vera? I mean it. Are you awake? - Hey, Ginger! You're wanted upstairs, the boss. - What's up? - Search me. Better get up there. - Excuse me, uh is Mr. Brott expecting me, do you know? - You can go right in. - Thank you. (muffled speech) - Come in, come in. This is Mr. Coffey. He's the one I was telling you about. - How do you do? I'm Ms. Monture. - Oh how do you do? - Arthur Keen. - How do you do? - Well, how bout it? You like it? Its your idea, you know. - Well that's uh very nice. Yeah, rent a crib, yes. - I'm going to make you an offer. How would you like to be my personal assistant on this project? - You're personal assistant? - At 100 bucks a week. How would that suit you? - Well that's very decent of you, sir. - No, no its only fair. After all, you gave us the idea. Come here. This is your office. Glad to have you with us. We'll have to get you a typist because you have a lot of organizing to do and I want you to work full time on rent a crib. Go on, think of ideas for promotion. Now lets get going on this art. I think we should stick to two colors. I think five by three is just about the right... - Excuse me, sir. Sir, the trouble is that I have another job. - Oh you mean the proofreading? No, no I want you to quit that. If its the money, remember 100 a week is just a start. - No, sir, no. Its not the money, no sir, its a good job. Its a job I'm promised. - What job? - Sir, its a reporter, on the Tribune. Now that's worth having you look best. - Reporter? I don't know a reporter in this province you couldn't buy for 20 bucks an a plain envelope. Come on, Coffey. - No sir, no. No, its a promise. - You know, you'd be making a terrible mistake, Coffey. - You see, Mr. Brott. I do have to have something with a bit of a future it. - [Brott] Well there's a future here. - Ah yes, sir, but, its not exactly the kind of future that I have in mind. - Its your life. Well lets round this one for a month and as for weekly, I think a week or two. - Sir uh, sir I don't think that you understood. You see, I'd be starting as reporter but I'd have a very good chance of winding up as an editor. - So you're quitting us? - Yes sir. Sir, I was going to tell you in a day or two. - Okay. Take Mr. Coffey off salary at the end of the week. - Mr. Brott. Thank you very much indeed for the offer. - Good luck. I hope you know what you're doing. - Isn't your mother home? - She said she wouldn't be home for dinner. - Didn't you make anything to eat? - I didn't have time. - Oh geeze. Now fry me up a couple of eggs, will ya? - I have homework. - You know there's nobody do anything for me in this house. Day and night. Those two jobs, that was enough to kill a horse. - Is it true you and mommy are separating? - Mommy tell you that? - [Paulie] She said we're moving out tonight. - You're not moving anywhere, my girl because I'm gonna get promoted tonight and that's our arrangement. - She said you're not going to get any promotion and after we come back from up north we're moving into her new place. - What's that, up north? - Well, Joe McGlade's going up to report on a ski meet and he's giving me a lift. - What and mommy's going too? She thinks I'm bluffing. I'm not bluffing at all, I can tell you that. She'll change her mind when I get that promotion. She'll change her mind about a lot of things. I know your mother. Oh god. Hello, Mickey. That's hot. - Can you tell me where I'll find Mr. Fox? - Who? - Fox, proofreader. - Well you better look... - Do you want Mr. Fox? - Yes. - Are you a proofreader? - That's right, names Alice. - You're their new man? - That's right. - And old McGregor, he hired you, did he? Right on the button. Well old Fox, he's in there. He's the big fella in there with the beard and the crutch. He's right there at that middle bench. (whistling) Hello, Sandy. Is McGregor in there? - Sure is. (whistling) (talking in background) - I want a player on that (mumbles). - The Canadian press color is a sidebar, sir. - Right, we'll take a number two in the shoe week convention. - How bout three two column cots and a button up on the top of the page? - Okay, make university chancellors a one column cut of three. - Will do, Mr. Mac. - What do you want? - This is quite all right, sir. Just when you have a minute. - I have a minute. What is it? - Ah well, sir. Its Friday. - Friday, what are you talking about? - You'll be remembering your promise, sir. - Give me that. Huh, who? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go ahead, go ahead. Go on, get back to work. - But sir, look here, sir. You promised you'd make me a reporter. - Clarence? - Still short on the proof desk, Mr. Mac. - Oh, Mr. Clarence. Look here, now you're very busy, you've probably forgotten, sir. You've just hired a new man down there. - I know. The Union's filed a complaint. We've been short staffed at that desk. - Come on, we've got a paper to get out here. - Look, Mr. McGregor, sir. Look, look, sir. This is very important to me. I've given up another job for this. - More fool you. - Now look here, sir. You promised to make me a reporter. - Clarence. - I don't recall any promise, Mr. Mac. - Come on, let's go boys, let's go. - Come on, let's go. - Take your hand off me. - Don't push me. - I'll push you if I want to. (overlapping shouting) - Richie! (overlapping shouting) - All right, all right, all right. (muffled shouting) (tense dramatic music) hello, no is mommy there? What? What she want a cab for? McGlade? What he say? No, no. It wasn't like that at all. Oh you're fitting out? Oh that's very nice, running out on me now. No, I don't want to talk to her. I don't want to talk to any of you. Oh, good riddance. (somber reflective music) (laughing) (speaking French) - Did you enjoy it, Ginger? Well goodnight, Ginger. See you around. - We'll get together and have a drink real soon, okay? - Go on, Ginger. Walk me to the bus. (drunken mumbling) You'll be. Give me liberty. To hell with Hitler. (drunken mumbling) (speaking French) - Well, officer, I was just coming along this street and I was. Uh, well. Its very cold. I felt the uh, I felt the call of nature, you see. So I uh, I just come into this corner. I mean there's nobody about. (speaking French) What offense? (speaking French) Did you say I was drunk? I'm not drunk. (speaking French) No, I'm not a liar. No, no listen. Officer, could we not, could we not someway settle this? We don't have to go through all this, do we? (speaking French) I don't, you don't understand. No, you don't understand me. I'm not trying to bribe you, honest. - My partner over there, he heard you, eh? Come on, in. (men shouting) - [Cop] Shut up! - You have three dollars, 62 cents. It will be arranged tomorrow morning. There's a phone inside you can use. Go in the cells now. (man humming) (distant talking in background) (man singing in foreign language) (man speaking French) (man speaking French) - James Francis Coffey. James Francis Coffey. On the 20th of February, in the city of Montreal, province of Quebec. At premises at Dorchester Street, known as the Windsor Hotel, did willfully do an indecent act in a public place by exposing your person in a manner detrimental to the public will. Do you plead guilty or not guilty? - Not guilty, your honor. - Is the prisoner represented by council? (speaking French) This case is being tried in English. - Sorry, your honor. He did not ask for a lawyer. - Proceed with the case. - Mr. Coffey, please come forward. - [Judge] Call the first witness. - [Lawyer] Constable Maurice Leverine, please take the stand. (speaking French) (speaking French) - Police officer Montreal Police Department. (mumbles). - Exactly where did the incident take place? - At the side entrance of the hotel, your honor. - [Judge] Was there anyone else in the street at the time? - [Cop] Not as far as I could see, but there were people in the lobby. - Did they see the accused? - They could have but we took such speedy action, your honor-- - Constable. If there are to be any compliments to the police department this morning, would you please allow them to come from me? What time did the incident occur? - At 2:45 in the morning. He had been drinking and he tried to bribe me. - But you didn't charge him with that, did you? - No, your honor. - Do you have anything, any question to ask to the witness? - No sir, no. No, no questions, no. - That will be all, thank you. Mr. Coffey. - Sir? - [Judge] Have you anything to say in your defense? - Uh, yes, sir. I think I do, yes. - [Judge] Take the stand. Swear in the accused. - Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? - Yes indeed, that's what I do, yes. - So help you god. State your name, occupation, address, and age. - Name is J.F. Coffey, 1221 Place Street. No occupation at the moment, sir and I'm 39 years old. - You heard the testimony of the constable. Had you been drinking? - Aye, sir, I had few drinks. Very cold there, it was a long time waiting at the bus stop. - You're Irish, by the sound of you. - Yes. - Then we'll take it that you had a few. (laughter) And how long did you wait for the bus? - Oh, I waited there a long time there, sir. Spent at least 20 minutes. - Not that long. I can see you're not a native of Montreal. (laughter) did you know it was a hotel? - No, sir. As a matter of fact, I thought it was an office building. - Oh I see. And in your country, is it common practice to relieve yourself in the office doorways? (laughter) What do you have to say for yourself? - Well sir, I uh, I'm a new Canadian. I find it difficult to get settled down-- - Come to the point. - Yes, sir, well. My wife and I, we had agreed that, I was got, gonna get promoted to be a reporter all right but sir I got sacked and uh, well that, truth of the matter is sir, I couldn't look after my wife and my child. - [Judge] Do you have anything more to say that is pertinent to the charge? - No, sir, no. - Step down, please. All right, there's been no citizens complaint and there seems to be no previous record. I must say that there's some question in my mind as to why the police prefer the most serious charge indecent exposure. Constable, when you make a charge you must have proved to substitute your charge. How many times have I told the police department that very thing? To end this case, I'm inclined to give the accused the benefit of the doubt of the charges indecent exposure and no other, I have decided to dismiss it. (speaks French) (speaking French) (horn honks) (soft tense classical music) - I just want to say goodbye. - Are you going up north? - Yes, skiing. We're on our way to pick up Paulie. - Would you have time for a cup of coffee? - I'll tell Joe to get Paulie and go over to my place. (somber classical music) - Did you see them all laugh at me in the court? I was just a joke to them. My whole life was just a joke. Standing there in the dark, I kept wondering, what's it matter about good jobs? What's it matter what people think? You were right, you know? Dear, if you're gonna go up north I best be taking you back to your place. - What are you going to do now? Go back to Ireland? - Oh no. This is home now. - You're right. We're staying here, too. - A fellow could be worse off. - You know, Ginger. I'm sure that man at the diaper place would give you that job as his assistant, if you wanted it. Oh, why in a couple of months from now, you'll have forgotten all this ever happened. I'll bet you a slap up dinner and a night on the town that you'll have a good job and you'll be sitting pretty. - You sound just like me, you know? (soft reflective classical music) (soft reflective music) Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
