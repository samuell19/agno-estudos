[roaring] [suspenseful music] [festive music] -Sorority, sorority! [chatter] [a girl] Let's cut her head off! [screaming] [dramatic music] [a girl - intercom] On behalf of the staff and myself, I would sincerely like to wish all those students leaving for Christmas vacation a pleasant journey, and the happiest of holidays. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank those parents who have contributed so generously to the school recreation and chapel fund. -You have to stop being this way! You have to! -Vivian. Vivian, the game! Vivian! -All right, Harry! -Will you hurry up, already? I spend a fortune to send this kid here, you wanted to get her, okay, we got her, now let's put her in a bag and get out of here. Hey. A fortune I spent on the 50-yard line. A fortune I spent on 50 yards, and you're going to wrap it all the way. Wrap, wrap, wrap, wrap, wrap, wrap. You and that kid. The two of you, you're going to drive me nuts. -Take good care of him, okay? -Oh, I will. [the principal - intercom] If somebody has their underwear hanging on the south line with a blue stain, they better remove them... -Bye. -See you in two weeks. -Bye. -Buy some milk, okay? Bye. [a girl - intercom] Attention. I think it would be proper, at this time, on behalf of myself and the rest of the student body, to give Mrs. Cowper's retirement attention to this educational facility, and to wish her the happiest of holidays and a quick, safe return. -You suck up! [a girl - intercom] Get away from that! -Have a good time. If you have the chance, bring me back a couple presents. -Men. -Okay. -Okay, have a good time. [a girl - intercom] Attention. Because of delay in the day, Mrs. Jensen says that dinner will be delayed 30 minutes. And we'll be eating in the peer dining room, instead of the main dining room, which will be closed during the holidays. Stop that! -Bye bye! [radio chatter] [romantic music] -Do you know where I wish I was spending Christmas? -In a funny hutch. -I'd rather spend Christmas in a cave than with my mother and her freaky artist friends. [Trisha] A cave? That's going a bit far, don't you think? -Not if you knew her mother. -I wish I was going home. -You would. -Come on now, girls, dinner's ready. -All right! Hey, Mrs. Jensen, what did you fix? [Mrs. Jensen] Stew and for dessert, cherry pie. -Oh! -My favourite. -Anything you can get your hands on is your favourite. -Shove it. -Any particular place, sweetheart? -Sex freak. -Oh, I thought I had that title wrapped up. -You shouldn't let the others get to you. -They don't. Not really. -Come on, let's eat, I'm starved. [suspenseful music] -Now you can start. -Smells great, Mrs. Jensen. -Oh, thank you, Nancy. Mrs. Calvin called. She won't be back until after the weekend. Her mother's ill. Poor woman. She says to be good, and not to get into any trouble. In the meantime, I'll be looking out after you. -Great! I couldn't have planned this better if I tried. -Planned what? -Shh, keep your voice down, or Jensen will hear you. -Well, is somebody going to tell us something? Or are we just going to sit here until we start laying eggs? -Something's going to get laid. -What time are they coming? -Go ahead, Leia, tell them. -T.J. is coming up with a few of his friends tonight. -Oh, how nice. -Pass the stew. He's flying. -You're telling me. -And his father's playing stupid. He called me this morning. "And with Mrs. Calvin gone for the weekend, you're going to have one hell of a time!" -In that case, then, I suppose I'll tidy up a little bit. -Who's he bringing with him? -I don't know, he didn't say. -Now, the pie. It's for dessert. Where's Cynthia? -Oh, she wasn't feeling well, so she went up to bed early. -Oh. Maybe I should take something up to her. -She said she wasn't hungry. -Cynthia! Cynthia? [suspenseful music] Cynthia! -Paul? Paul, is that you? [Paul] Yeah! Hurry up, come on. Come on, let's go! [suspenseful music] [suspenseful music] [muffled] No, no! God, no! -Have you no pride at all? -How would you like this in a very delicate place? -Come on, you two, shut down. What time are they coming? [Leia] Midnight. -Oh God. Bless whoever built that airstrip. -God bless airplanes. [suspenseful music] [screaming] -I think I'm going crazy. [Melody] What's the matter? -Not enough pie. [laughing] [Melody] Now why didn't I think of that? -I just thought I saw something outside. -Keep watching. Any minute now, eight tiny reindeer are going to be coming along, and one of them is going to have a shiny red nose. -You better lay off the junk food, kid, you're beginning to have sugar hallucinations. -I know I saw it. I think. -I think I'll go get a Kleenex. -Bring me some perfume, will you? The Chanel. -Okay. -I saw it. [humming] -Where are you? Aha! Great! Oh, Jesus, you scared the hell out of me! -Miss Samantha has me looking on the plants. -Uh-huh. -It's our duty to take care of the plants. -Yeah. -Got put them here to give us pleasure. -Yeah, yeah, uh... Excuse me. Oh, by the way, Mrs. Jensen cooked up some cherry pie and stew. Better hurry on down before it's all gone. -I like cherry pie. -Yeah. You and Nancy both. -I like Nancy too. -Oh dear, so much stew left over. -Oh, it's Fast Ralph. What's happening, sibling? -Hello, girls. [laughing] -I think he used to be a gargoyle on the south side of Notre Dame. That's the stuff! -Hello, Ruth. -Oh, hello, Tina. -Ralph. -You look wonderful. -Oh yeah, real great, real great. By the time those butchers get through with me, I'll be nothing but leftovers. I brought some cannoli. -Oh! -What's cannoli? -Here, Ralph, put it in the fridge. -So, what did the doctors say? -They have to perform the bypass. 20 years I'm riding my bicycle. Best exercise in the world, they tell me. They have to perform a bypass. -Don't you go worrying now, everything's gonna be all right. -All right, my foot. I'm going to die! We all gotta die. I know I'm gonna die. Death is no stranger to me. I buried three husbands. So you think that's so bad? After the third one, it's just a piece of cake. -Mrs. Jensen, have we got a surprise for you! Oh hello, Mrs. Ranzini... Ranzoni. -A surprise, for me? -Yes, the girls and I have decided that we're going to do all the dishes and the cleaning up. We insist that you go to bed early, and leave everything to us. Now you just go on, and I'll fix you some nice hot milk and I'll bring it to you. -Oh, Leia, I don't know... -Well I do, now you just go on. It's about time you get a good night's sleep. -Good night. -Good night. -Good night, Ralph. Sleep tight. -I don't know how you stand that big gazock around here. He gives me the creeps. -Oh, Ralph's a good boy. He means well. And he's very handy. -I'm putting milk on, now. [Tina] You shouldn't working here, Ruth, with all those rich, pompous bitches. Living out here in the middle of nowhere. -Something goes wrong, you think they're going to tell the house mother? [Ruth] Now, Tina. They're good girls! -I'll be back in a moment, you go on to bed! Good night, Mrs. Ranzoni. -So, did you pull it off? -Of course! She's on her way to bed and sweet dreams. -Are you sure that stuff is going to work? -Oh yeah, yeah, she'll sleep for ten or 12 hours. Guaranteed. She may even sleep forever. -I wonder what she dreams of. -Oh who cares, as long as she doesn't bother us. Nancelina! -What? -You are going to give her the milk. Well, you're the only one she won't suspect of being underhanded! [sigh] -Why do I always have to do all the dirty work? -Because. -I have to go, now, Ruth. You really should think about doing something more with your life. -Now you take care of yourself, Tina. Let me know if there's anything you need. -Not unless you've got any spare bodies laying around. Listen, I'll stop in on my way back from Mrs. Willaby's. That is, if the grim reaper doesn't come calling. -I appreciate the cannoli. Thank you. -Yeah, thanks! [suspenseful music] -Mrs. Jensen? -Oh, hi Nancy. -Hi, I brought you your milk. -Oh, that's awfully sweet of you girls. -Well, it's the least we can do for you. You've been so nice to us. -You go to bed early, and be good. -We will. Good night! -Good night! Pleasant dreams! [Nancy] You too! [suspenseful music] -I think I can hear the plane. -Yeah, come on, we better hurry, maybe we can hit them with our flashlights! -Hey, I thought they weren't supposed to be here until midnight. -So they're early, more time for fun. -Oh, Ralph. -You shouldn't be out here at night like this. It's dangerous. -Oh, it's all right, Ralph. Some of Leia's friends are coming up. -Well, you can take my flashlight. -Thank you. -I want you to be safe. -Hurry it up, hurry it up, we've been waiting! -Hey guys, ransacking time, let's go! -Stop it! -Varying things, of course. -Of course? You're late! -This isn't scheduled airlines! -No lie! -Okay. I'm ready! -What do you want, what do you want?You silly twit! [moaning] -Well worth the flight. -Hey, here I am. -We waited a hell of a lot longer than you did, dickhead Should have used reindeer! -Didn't you hear? -About what? -They're on strike this year. Something about wanting their own union. -Oh, you're crazy! -You're cute. -Tally-ho! -Thanks, master T.J.! -Stay with the plane, okay? -We've got room for him. -Yeah? -Yeah. -I don't. Stay with the plane. -Yes, sir! [giggling] -Nancy, what are you doing here? -Looking for you. -Well you found us, now come on! -Someone remember to come back later and get the luggage. -Yeah, kid.

You know, I've often thought of taking up the guitar. -It beats carrying around a piano. [metal creaking] [suspenseful music] -You know, there was a time when doctor's couldn't take an X-ray picture of the brain because the cranium was so thick, the only way they could get the X-ray to take a picture of an abnormality was to inject with coloured dyes or air bubbles. -I hope I never get sick. -By the time you're 30, we should have most things licked. Except accidents. -I'll go get us a couple of beers. -Hurry. -Don't be impatient! It's going to be a long night. -And now we have this new computerized head scanner that can now show us... -Alex. You're going to bore this sweet young thing to death. -Am I boring you to death? -No. I'm enjoying it, really. -Lady, you have a hell of a high pain threshold. -Excuse me. [suspenseful music] -Tom? Will you stop messing around? And seduce me like a man? Oh Tom, take that bloody mask off. Take me to bed. [muffled screaming] [dramatic music] -You should be in bed. -Well, um... We're just having a little party, Ralph. -It's late, and you should be in bed. -I will. -And lock your door, too. I want you to be safe, Nancy. There's evil here. I can feel it, the... the devil's here. -Don't worry, Ralph, I will. Good night. [guitar music] -That was a wonderful song. Who's it about? -I wrote it for my little brother when he was born. -Where the hell is Trisha with the beer? -Maybe she left you. [laughing] [imitating English accent] -With my charm? No chance. [laughing] -Tom sure is funny. [suspenseful music] -Trisha? Oh, Trisha? Come on, miss high society. Get your act together! I'm in no mood to play hide and seek! [dramatic music and screaming] -You were supposed to wait for me! I was going to put on something really sexy and drive you crazy! -You're already driving me crazy. [screaming] [laughing] -Oh! -Hm! -Trisha? [suspenseful music] Trisha! Trisha? [dramatic music] [groaning] [suspenseful music] -Hey, where is everybody? -Gone to bed, or wherever. -It doesn't sound like a bad idea to me. -Not a bad idea at all. Come on, James. Time to put your measurable knowledge... to work. -Well, I think you better show me to my room. -Exactly what I had in mind. -I think I had too much to drink. -Half a beer? -Uh-huh. -You wouldn't be chickening out on me, would you? -Well... -Come on, Einstein. It's time for your advanced course... in relativity. -All right! What? -You're going to have to catch me first! I'm the fastest girl in school! -Yeah, I'll bet. -That wasn't what I meant. -It'll do, won't it? -Maybe... -Let's find out! [panting] -You're out of breath! -You're going to wear me down, then I'll be useless. [Sam] Come on, a big, strong boy like you? -Big, yes, but strong? Not if we keep this up! [groaning] Oh, my back! Help me! -You're faking it! -That's what my high school coach used to tell me. This better be worth the chase. -It will be. -Sit still. [heavy breathing] -We can't do this here. -Why not? -Other people might come in. -Are you kidding? They're all out for the night. [suspenseful music] [suspenseful music] [humming] [screaming] [laughing] -You see that wall over there? You're going to drive me straight up it. -Oh, we've never done it on the wall before! -No, we haven't. Well, we've done it everywhere else. -Come on, tiger. -Hey, wait a minute. Time out, coach. -What? Oh, time out? You have drunk all the wine. -How about you grab us a couple of beers? -Oh, energy for the troops, eh? -It's me, the troops! -All right! You just lie there and be comfortable, fly boy. Let me take care of everything. [T.J.] Come here, you. I'm going to get you! [Leia] You know, you've been around the high altitude too long. You sure you still want that beer? [T.J.] You know what I want? [Leia] Yes, sir! [gasping] Jesus, you scared me! -Sorry. -What are you doing, haunting the halls? -I was just on my way to get some milk. -Come on. I need to get some beer for the troops. -Okay. -Man, this is the best vacation I've ever had. I'm gonna marry this one. -That's kind of a sudden decision. -Honey, his fortune is too much to count. And besides, he's not so bad in the sack, either. Not the best, mind you, but not the worst. [suspenseful music] You doing okay? -Sort of. -Don't worry, your time will come. In the meantime, here's your milk. -Thanks. Ick! -Ew! -Blood... -Fast Ralph probably cut himself with the shears. Well, see you later cat, I gotta reel this sucker in. [suspenseful music] [screaming] -Sorry. -It's you. -I just came to get a drink. -I have some milk. -Fine. Thank you. -You're welcome. -Good night. -Good night. [dramatic music] [moaning] [moaning] [suspenseful music] [moaning] [moaning] [suspenseful music] [moaning] [grunt] [screaming] [Nancy] What are you doing here? -Shh. Something is wrong. Something is happening here. -What do you mean, Ralph? -Miss Nancy, I'm a man of the land. And I know y'all think I don't know much. But I know when something is wrong. You've gotta watch yourself. -Don't come any closer, Ralph. -You're the only one, out of all of them... You're the only one. I like you, Nancy. And I want you to be all right. You must pray. Pray so the devil won't claim you for one of his own. I'll be with you. I'll take care of you, I promise. -Good night, Ralph. -Good night, miss Nancy. And pray, please! [suspenseful music] [suspenseful music] [muttering] -Well? Do you like it? -Measurement... It's very nice. -Nice? -Uh-huh. -That's the best you can do? -Well, what I mean is it's very nice. -Do you know how much this cost? -No. -A fortune. And you don't like it. -No, I mean, I like it, really. -Really? -Really. -You've never done it before, have you? -Done what? -You know. -Oh, of course I have. -Of course you haven't. -Well, I almost did, once. -Imagine, I get to do a first timer. Come here, you. -I'm all right here. -You'll be better over here. -I really have to be going to bed. -Exactly where I'm trying to put you. -Well, what I mean is... [clatter] -I know what you mean. Now come here. Come on. Who buys your shorts? -I do. -They're awful. -Oh, I'm sorry! [laughing] Oh, God. -I'll be changing that to "oh, Melody." -Oh, Melody. -Oh what? -Oh, nothing. -Oh my. -Oh my God. Oh dear. [suspenseful music] I think the Rams are definitely going to win the pennant. [laughing] [T.J.] What's gotten into you? That's the first time I heard you talk about anything besides X-rays and molecules. -I'm not so sure you boys should be staying here. It's not allowed, you know. -Oh, we didn't mean to stay so long. As soon as we repair the plane... we're out of here! -You look so young to be flying an airplane. [laughing] -I mean, heck, my father taught me to fly when I was 18. -Besides, he brought a pilot. -Well, I hope you get it fixed. Because it's not allowed by school rules for you guys to stay overnight, you know? The superintendent's gonna be back tomorrow and she's going to be very angry. -Don't worry, we'll be out of here as soon as possible. -Mrs. Jensen, did you sleep well? -Oh. Yes, thank you. -Hey, where are the others? [T.J.] Oh, who cares? Who needs them? I'm having a good enough time without them. [Leia] Probably still crashed out. -Listen, I've got a dynamite idea. -I thought you were tired? -Wise guy, huh? It's a dynamite day, let's have a picnic. -I like it! We can play some football or something. -Or something? Everybody has this something on their mind. -Don't get carried away, Tarzan. Not yet, anyway. [kissing noise] [laughing] [T.J.] Oh, don't tell me the whizz kid finally scored. What did she say her name was? Melody, huh? That's one interesting tune. -I can go get the others. -Yeah, tell them to hurry up. -Trish, Sam? Is anybody home? [screaming] -Oh, brother, have you changed. -Your fault. -Fault? I thought it was a beautiful gesture. -Oh it was, and I'll never be the same. -Good. -Hey, come back here! -Come and get me! [Alex] Oh, you asked for it. [T.J.] I wonder what the hell happened to Tom and Trisha. [Leia] Oh, I don't know, they're probably lost in the woods. I promised them a good time. -Well, I'm sure they're having a good time. -I think I'm going to go for a walk. -Now, don't get into any trouble. -Fat chance. -Hey, Nance? -Huh? -Don't sweat it. You'll get lucky sooner or later. -You sure have a way with words. -Did I say something wrong? -Well, you could have kept your mouth shut. -Can I help it if she's so damn sensitive? -T.J., sometimes you can be such a horse's ass. -Yeah? That's not what you said last night. -I change when the sun comes up. -Hm! -Uh-huh. [imitating Romanian accent] -Dracula's daughter? [laughing] Yes! [suspenseful music] [suspenseful music] -Gonna get you! [gasping] Oh, hey, don't get mad. I was just having fun. -It's okay. -What you doing? -Walking. -Oh. -You're cute. -No I'm not. -Yes you are! -No, I'm not. -Yes, you are. -No I'm not! [groaning] Alex, don't. Alex! You're crazy! [screaming] -Thanks for your help. But from the way Kramer was found, it's obvious what happened. -Who would ever want to kill Ralph Kramer? -That's what I'm going to find out. I'm gonna have to get in touch with the other kids, and... probably contact their parents. -Hey, do you have to do that? It's going to be a bit awkward, you see, they think we're somewhere else. -Are you serious? Christ's sake. -Hey man, look, whoa, hold on! Can't you keep us out of it? We're going to wind up in a lot of trouble if our parents find out about this! Anyway, we didn't kill the old nut! -I appreciate your dilemma, son. But a man's been murdered. Do you understand me? Now, does anyone else know where the others might be? -Please, if anyone knows anything, tell the officer. This is very serious. -Look, I know you might feel you need to protect the others, but think of this. There's been one murder already. There might be others. For Christ's sake, your friends might be in trouble! Come on. -Mister Polansky, if we knew anything, we'd tell you. But we don't. You don't think they could've killed Ralph? [Polansky] Everybody's a suspect, miss. I just want to know where they are. My men have searched this place with a fine-toothed comb and haven't come up with anything. -What do you think could have happened to them? -I don't know. But I sure as hell am going to find out. Been a cop for all my life. Been chief of police here for almost a year and I haven't had a case I couldn't figure. I don't intend this to be the first. [Ruth] We'll do anything we can to help you, officer. And the superintendent will be back tomorrow. I know she can help you. -I'm going to leave two of my men here around the clock. I want you to stay indoors so I can locate you at a moment's notice. Understand? -Mister Polansky? -Yes? -I'm really scared. I may be crazy, but I'm really scared. Ralph came into my room last night, and he told me that... I don't know, he was just like preaching religion to me. -Oh, he was always running about... -No Leia! He told me that something evil was happening. And I should have told somebody. -You can't hold yourself responsible. Can you foresee the future? -That doesn't make me feel any better. -I know. I know. I did some checking on Kramer. He spent some time in a mental hospital. Two accounts of armed robbery, assault with a deadly weapon. He didn't exactly hang around with a gentle crowd. I'll check on some of his old friends, maybe they had something against him. I promise. I'll check on him. If anything comes up... or you find anything important, give me a call! Bye, Ruth. Sorry to inconvenience you. Remember. Stay indoors tonight. And make sure this place is locked up tight. -What we all need is a good hearty meal. I'll start dinner. -Something's happened to the others, I know it! -Oh, come off it! Just because weird Ralph got himself murdered doesn't mean something happened to the others. -Look, Leia's right, don't go getting crazy for nothing. -Leia's wrong. -What do you mean? [Alex] Just what I said, Leia's wrong. They wouldn't split without telling someone. Maybe not me, but certainly T.J. -Man, don't start getting weird on me. [Alex] It's not weird! It's just a fact. -Who do you think you are, Sherlock Holmes? -I wish I was. Then I wouldn't be so preoccupied for my life. -I knew we were in trouble. -Maybe Mrs. Jensen has some ideas. -Are you kidding? She's lost outside the kitchen. -We've gotta do something. -What? -I don't know. -Oh, we're all worried about nothing. They'll be back any minute! At least, that's what I think. And if you're smart, you'll think the same. -I don't know what to think. -Man, this whole thing sucks. -Alex? Do you really believe we're in danger? -Yes. -Why? -I already told you. -Just because the others didn't come back? -They're never coming back. -I don't believe this! You're all crazy! -I believe you. -I wish I was wrong. -Oh, me too. -I'm sorry I scared you this afternoon. -It's okay. -You must have been really scared. -I was. -I won't let anything happen to you, I promise. -I'm scared. -Me too. [Polansky] Hey, you two, come here. I want this place patrolled around the clock, all right? You figure out your own schedule. If anything goes wrong, I want you to know that I'm going to have you transferred to the middle of the desert. -Don't worry about it, chief, we'll take care of it. -Okay, okay, one other thing, wrap. You know, the people that send their kids to this school, they have a lot of political power. So you put your hands on any of those little fillies, and I'll personally change your vocal pitch. You got me? -Chief. I got a definite feeling we got no opportunity for advancement. -I think we'd do better being the bad guys. -There's a lot of material around here to be bad with. -Mrs. Jensen? [Ruth] Uh-huh? -Can we talk with you for a minute? -Sure. -Mrs. Jensen. I think we're in quite a bit of danger. -Danger? Why should we be in any danger? -Ralph was murdered. The man who murdered him could still be around. -Oh dear. That must be why the chief left the policemen here. Well, I think we should be safe enough. With the policemen around here to protect us. -I guess so. We just wanted you to know. -We wouldn't want anything to happen to you. -I keep this. No one will get smart with me. -I'm sure they won't. [humming] [suspenseful music] [humming] [giggling] -Well, I guess I better get out of here. -Good. I'm going to get some shut eye, and I'll relieve you at 12. -Right. -Do you really believe we're in that much danger? -Hey, if I were you, I wouldn't worry about a thing. Whoever killed Ralph Kramer is probably miles away by now. At least, he should be. Anyway, we're going to be here until he's caught. -Anyone like anymore coffee? -No thanks. -How about some more of my special cranberry jello surprise? -No thank you, ma'am, I've had so much already I can hardly move. And I've got to get some sleep. -Oh. Well, I'm sure we can put you up in a room here. -Leia. -Come on. I'll show you your room. -Look, I think we're getting all worked up over nothing! -For once, I wish you were right. Where have you been? -Changing. -Oh. -Well, at least I feel a whole lot better with the police being here. -Well, here you are. Hope you like it. -So far, so good. Who lives here? -Me. [chuckling] If you need anything, just holler. -Holler. -Maybe later. [giggling] [sigh] -I'm through now, so good night, everyone. [together] Good night! -I checked all the doors and made sure they're locked. Don't stay up too late. [Nancy] Okay. -She doesn't seem to be too worried. -A staunch upbringing, no doubt. -I wish I were home. -I thought you'd rather be anywhere but home. -And here. -Well, why don't we open up our Christmas presents? That might cheer us up. -Yeah! -It isn't Christmas yet. -So what? -We should wait and do it properly! -If we're around that long. -Oh, would you get off it? -Hey, where are you going? -I'm going to take a shower. -Sounds great. -Alone. [T.J.] Suit yourself. [Leia] I usually do. -One of these days. -You should ask your pilot in. It'd be one more hand... -No, no way! I hate the guy. Besides, he's probably too stoned to walk anywhere. He did something for my father, a few years back, saved his life, something like that. -Melody's right. -No way! -We need all the help we can get! -Look, nothing is going to happen. -What about the person who murdered Ralph? -Yeah. -Like the cop said, he's probably a thousand miles away by now. -What about the others? -Hey, you know Tom and Blake. -Do you think we're going to be all right? -Of course! Look, everybody's running around like they have the heebie-jeebies or something. -I hope you're right. -Ease up, huh? Just listen to T.J.. I'm going to grab a beer, does anybody want one? -No. -No? -I'll take one. I need it. -Stay right there. [suspenseful music] Anyone there? [Leia] You are terrible! [Jim] That's what the chief thinks too. But fun to be with. [giggling] You know the one about the Louisiana swamp? [Leia] No. [laughing] [suspenseful music] [suspenseful music] -Thought you guys might have run out on me. -No chance. We just felt more comfortable in here. -I think I'm going to check this place out. -I'll go with you. -Okay. You guys wanna go? -No, I think we'll wait here. [sipping] [wood splintering] [suspenseful music] -Seems okay. -Uh-huh. -The hell are you doing up here in that dumb outfit? [dramatic music] -I feel like a trapped rat in here. -Yeah, me too. I feel like I can't breathe. -Well, let's go get some fresh air. -I don't think that's such a good idea. -You're not buying all this crap, are you? Besides, we have Starsky and Hutch right outside to protect us. -Are you sure? -What, about going outside or about Starsky and Hutch? -Both. -I'm sure. -Maybe we shouldn't. -Marylin... I mean Melody, Melody! Five years of karate. Ha! I'm a black belt! Nobody gonna mess around with this boy! [floors creaking] [suspenseful music] [doors jiggling] [Alex] I think we're beginning to hear things. -Maybe. -Let's go check upstairs. -Okay. -I don't like this. -What's up there? -I don't know, I've never been up there. -Let's find out. -Okay. [suspenseful music] -Does anybody live in there? -I don't know, I don't think so. -There? Seems all right. [floors creaking] [gasping] -What was that? -I think it was a draft. -Don't. -Do you want to stay up here all night? -No. -Just wait. -You can't start worrying about these things. You'll take the whole flow out of the beautiful things in life. Then where does that leave you? I'll tell you where that leaves us, lady. Up the old crick without a paddle. -Really? -Yeah, really. [laughing] Yeah, whatever that means. [Alex] Nancy? Just a supply closet. -Can we go now? Okay. Alex? Can anyone get in? -Anyone can get in anywhere if they want to bad enough. -I guess that was kind of a dumb question, huh? -Not really. -Let's go down with the others. -Okay. [floors creaking] -Where's T.J. and Melody? -Well, knowing T.J., they're somewhere. Like under a rock. -You don't like him very much, do you? -Not much. -Then why did you come here with him? -No place else to go. Except my aunt. She doesn't like me very much. -What about your parents? -Having a good time in Europe. They're always having a good time somewhere. What are you staring at? -That picture. It sure doesn't feel much like Christmas. -I'll take care of that. [groaning] -Oh, a gentleman. -Where are you off to? -I am going to take a shower. -Well, have fun! -I already did. [giggling] [suspenseful music] [screaming] [dramatic music] [screaming] -Somehow, it's not so scary once we're out here. -There's really nothing to be afraid of. -I thought you were interested in Leia. -Yeah, I was. But... She doesn't... she doesn't have half as much as you. -I didn't think you even noticed me. -I noticed you from the first day. -Where is that cop, anyway? He's liable to catch us. -You know, I don't know. And I don't even care. -You wanna dance? -I'd like that. -Good. Gives me a chance to hold you closer. You are cute. -I'd rather be beautiful. -You are beautiful. [suspenseful music] [dramatic music] [screaming] -Help, help! Somebody open the door! [Melody] Help! -Alex. That's Melody! -What is she doing out there? -Help! [banging] Help! Someone open up! Please! -What happened? -He's dead! -Who's dead? -Oh my God, he's dead! -What happened? -T.J.! Oh my God, we're going to die! We're all going to die! -Pull yourself together! Pull yourself together! [slapping] -Alex, we've got to go get the others! -Yeah. Come on, Melody, come on. [sobbing] Shh. Come on. -Where is she? -Where's Leia? -In the shower, come on! [suspenseful music] [Nancy] Oh my God! [gagging] [screaming] [sobbing] -I've gotta get help! [Leia humming] -It's Leia. [Leia humming] Leia? Leia! Oh, Leia! Leia, it's me, Nancy! Leia, oh. Come on. It's going to be okay. -I wish. [Melody] Nancy, we've got to make it to the plane, it's our only chance! -Alex, where's Alex? Look out! -You killed my baby. -Mrs. Jensen? -You killed my baby. You gave her drugs! You were her friend. [Leia humming] You were there, Nancy. She was so young, so beautiful. -I didn't even know her! -Don't you lie to me! You were her friend. You pushed her off the balcony. You were there! -This is my first year here, I don't even know her! [screaming] -You were there! [dramatic music] [panting] [panting] [screaming] -Wake up, please! -What's the matter? -They're dead, they're all dead!Everyone! -What are you raving about? -Move, you drunken slug, move, or we're going to die! -All right, all right! What happened? -They're dead, they're all dead! And the killer's going to come after us! -What about T.J.? -He's dead! -Are you sure? -Yes, will you hurry, please? -T.J.'s dead? [suspenseful music] -What's wrong? -Generator. -Can you fix it? -I'm working on it. -Will you hurry, please? -Will you please hold your horses? Jesus Christ. [engine whirring] [screaming] [Leia humming] [Ruth] Nancy... Nancy... [dramatic music] [dramatic music] [screaming] Die! [grunting] Bitch! [suspenseful music] [suspenseful music] Nancy... Nancy... It's the only room left, Nancy. It's the only room left. [dramatic music] [dramatic music] She was so young. So beautiful. [screaming] [groaning] [sobbing] [Leia humming] [sobbing] -You killed my wife. You... You killed our daughter. I should have killed you first. [screaming] [dramatic music] [screaming] [sobbing] -Nancy, it's all right, everything's going to be all right. I had to hide. I had to hide. I didn't know what was going on. I panicked, I panicked. -Hold me... Take me away from here. -Leia! -It's all over! -We've got to go back for Leia! -We'll send somebody back for her! It's all over. Okay, come on, you ready? Come on. Come on, come on baby. [Leia humming] [dramatic music] [roaring]
