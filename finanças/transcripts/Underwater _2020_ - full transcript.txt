When you're underwater for months at a time, you lose all sense of day and night. And there's only awake and dreaming. Not that those things are easy to tell apart. I think, or I dream about the first thing he ever said to me. Told me he didn't believe in time... only moments. Hmm. He was a glass-half-full type. All right. I prefer it empty. What are you doing here? I mean, there's a comfort to cynicism. There's a lot less to lose. Wake up! Pressure breach! Pressure breach! We gotta get to the bulkhead! Structural integrity compromised. Everyone up! Everyone up! Come on! Structural integrity compromised. What the hell is happening? Let's go! Pressure breach! We gotta seal the bulkhead! De-pressurization warning. Seal the bulkhead. - De-pressurization warning. - I don't have my keycard! Here, here, here. - No! - Bulkhead jammed. I gotta get inside this thing now! - Reboot required. - Where is it? Where is it? Oh, my God! Come on! De-pressurization warning. Seal the bulkhead. Come on, come on, come on, come on. The whole rig is about to implode! If you don't shut these doors, it'll take the whole station with us! Okay! Okay, okay, okay, got it, got it, got it! - System online. - Shut the door! - Wait! - Hey, hey, hey. Wait for us! - Hey! - Run! - Run! - Come on! Guys, run! Come on, come on! - Hey! Hey, hey! - Come on, guys, let's go! Come on, run! Norah, Norah! They're not gonna make it. - Close the door! - Norah! We have to close the door, otherwise the whole rig will die. Shut the door now! Structural failure is imminent as the result of an... incident. To all Kepler Station crew, structural failure is imminent. Repeat, structural failure is imminent. Hey, hey. You okay? Was that an earthquake? I don't know. Had to have been like a ten or eleven. I don't even know what channel we'd be... All personnel report to pod bays for immediate evacuation. This is Kepler. Control, can you hear me? Kepler Station status, 70% compromised. Reactor unstable. Control, this is Kepler, can you hear me? Kepler Station status, 70% compromised. Mayday. Mayday. Mayday. Can anyone hear me? We have to get to the pod bays. Come on. As a crew member, we want you to know that you're not just part of a team, you're part of our family. No, no, no. That doesn't go through. Have a complaint? Address it to your superior officer. Oh, yes, working. I just got to find the nearest pods. Senior engineers, please report to engineering. Rodrigo, right? Yeah. Norah. I-I know. I usually work with the day shift. - Can you...? Can you help me out here? - Sure, I can. Um, are you a computer engineer or something? - Mechanical. - Okay. I can reset breakers. I've been down here for a bit. Hey, you gotta know... that wasn't our fault. I mean, you-you saved the entire rig. I... I didn't even know to close the door. Hmm. Bulkheads closed. Do you... Do you really think that was an earthquake? No. I-I don't know. That's not good. The hardline's been severed. Antenna's gone. I don't even think we can reach the surface. ...to the nearest escape pod as soon as possible. There's-there's evac pods in CR-7. Hey, we got this, all right? Some of this water is definitely sewage. Welcome aboard the Kepler Station, located just a mile away from the Roebuck... The titan-class sister station... The Kepler... pumps a crude... There we go. and we hope you enjoy your stay. Can we... Can we dig through there? I'll look inside. Yeah, I can fit up here, if you can. Come check. Hello? Can anyone hear me? Hello? Hello? Hey, do you hear that? - Hey! - Hello! Hey, keep talking, man. I can hear you. I'm under the rock! Take him, take him. Paul? Here, here, here, here. Hey, you. What's-what's going on down there? Your legs all right? - Yeah. - Okay. What do you need? To get the heck out of here. Yeah, yeah, I know. What can I do? - All right, all right. - All right. - You good? - Yeah. All right. - All right. Here. - Hey. - Norah? - You're good. Hi! Yes. You sweet, flat-chested elven creature. Okay, just breathe for a second. You're all good. - Is Lil Paul okay? - Yeah, he's cool. - Let me help you. - You wanna try to stand up? - Yeah. - All right, buddy. Here we go. Grab his arm? No, no, no. Wait. No, no. Okay, are you caught in anything? No, no, no, let's just be stronger. Okay. Okay, give me Lil Paul. - Yeah, here. - Thank you. Gotta go. Okay, I got my robe and my lucky sock. What are we doing? The evac pods in CR-7. - We're headed there, okay? - Okay. The upper decks are collapsing. We gotta move fast. Through that thing? You guys are crazy. I'm a big boy. All right. I think... Hold up. Bulkheads closed. Flooding contained. Okay. - You guys okay? - Yeah. There's-there's someone up here. It's... It's McClellen. Jesus. Hey, Rod. Come on, bud. Guys, I see the pod bay. Attention! Attention! All Kepler crew... Cap? Holy shit. He stayed behind? Wait, why's he just sitting there? Oh, shit. "Shit?" What's... What's "oh shit"? What? The evac pods are gone. - I need the line open. - Captain! Hey! Norah. You're alive. Cap. The door's jammed. Rodrigo, Paul. I need you two to check where we are on submersible. Now. All right, all right. On a scale from one to ten, how bad's my rig? Uh, ten. You're 70% compromised. Honestly, you-you breathe too hard in here, we're... Wait. Let me see. I don't get it. Was that like an earthquake or... I don't know. I'm trying to figure it out. Why are you still here? You should have gone up. There were pods here. 'Cause that's what captains do. Who cares? You have a kid, you should have gone up. Can you, uh, can you sit down, please? Any one of us would have shoved your ass onto that pod immediately. Listen to me. Everybody's getting out of here alive, you hear me? Okay? Hold that on your ear. I already sent 22 up. Smith reported seven dead. I found three. It was, it was Lee, Travis and McClellen, and, um, um, McCl... McClellen's hands were still warm so I-I know it was McClellen. I mean, she lives three floors up, and I was brushing my teeth, like, two hours ago. - I-I had to shut the door on the entire East wing. - Don't do this to yourself. So, actually, you know what, there could be more. Stop thinking back, look forward. Look forward. Look at me. Now you follow the light. Come on. Follow the light. Ça va ça va. Cap, that isa no-go on the submersibles. Copy that. I'm sending Norah to the control room. Emily, are you okay? Hey. - Oh, my gosh. You're alive. - Norah? - Hey. - You're alive. - Dude. - Ah, I hate that. - Have you heard anything? - No, no. Nothing. - How are the cooling towers? - I haven't checked 'em yet. - You wanna do it? - Yeah, yeah. See if anybody's alive out there. compromised. Bulkheads closed... Hey, hey. Someone's coming. Right? They're gonna... They're gonna send someone. I don't know. Thank you. I'm pretty sure they already sent someone. I'm less sure we have the time to wait for them. - Norah. - Yeah. So, the cooling towers? What are we getting? Oh, um... Nothing good. All the upper decks have collapsed and we lost the cooling towers. The core of the Kepler is completely unstable. Wait, what do you mean "unstable"? Like, poof, we all die "unstable"? What are we talking about here, Norah? The thermal cores. That's a lot of energy with nowhere to go. Okay, the intern's freaking me out. Can somebody just explain what the hell's going on here? Research assistant. No, there-there... There's a... There's a, um... If there's a meltdown, there's gonna be a lot of heat. There's gonna be a flash boil, explosions. I don't really know. I watch a lot of anime. That's all I know. Oh, you watch anime? I like anime. No, I mean, he's right. We have about 30 minutes till meltdown. And, uh, it's gonna blow us into tiny pieces to the surface. And people are gonna find us, like, floating around. Bulkhead compromised. Okay, guys, listen. The escape pods are gone and the sub is out of order. And we're not getting any more radio signals. And the structure of the Kepler is totally unsound. Captain, there better be a good punchline, 'cause this setup is... - So weak. - weak. We go for the Roebuck. The Roebuck? It's a mile down and a mile that way. - What are you talking about? - Yeah. How would we even get there? We walk. We what? Walk. We walk? That's what you dug me out of the rubble for? I can't walk. I don't even have a suit. Listen, listen. Listen to me. Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna drop down to the cargo elevator to the seafloor. Then we use the access tunnel to get to the Midpoint station. There we can charge and clean the rebreathers. And then we follow the markers across the plateau to the Roebuck. So we just go in the pitch black and we walk without knowing where we're going with insufficient oxygen? - That's the plan? - That's the plan. Everybody down with that? Norah, you okay with that? The suits can't be down there that long. You know that. Not everyone here is an experienced diver and... Than we never know. I'm-I'm not trying to be... Can you just admit we might die doing that? Yeah. But can you admit that we might live doing this? Hey, what about the old Shepard Station? Isn't that closer? Shepard Station's gone. There's nothing there. Uh, you guys, you need to hear this. Can this be something good? Could we please have one good thing? Could we? I think this was the last transmission from the drill site. Mayday, mayday! We've been compromised by category ten... Now, what the hell was that noise? Also, the temperature outside jumped ten degrees. Great, so it'll be warm when we're walking across the plateau. The water doesn't do that. That's impossible. That's just aftershocks from the last earthquake, okay? It's 'cause we drilled too deep. Okay? It's those tectonic plates I talk about all the time. This is insane. Okay, this is insane. We go for the Roebuck. What? If we're gonna do this, let's do it! Am I right? All right, we can compromise. I can turn it down. Emily. Lose your pants. They won't fit in the suit. Deck A compromised. Bulkheads closed. Flooding contained. Has anyone ever walked out there before? Longer than to fix a pipe. I mean, just... Just walked? No. Check if we have enough helmets. I just need you to find six good ones. Hey, Norah. Hey. - Thank you. - Yeah, sure. Hey. How you doing? You ready? All right. These are ripped too? Come on! All right, this is gonna suck. Okay. Oh, sorry, sorry! Okay. Good? Go suit up. Your air is good. Thank you. Okay, clear all this shit from the deck. What are you thinking? I'm thinking I really didn't like the sound on that transmission. We should take something. Yeah. That's a very valid point. Okay. Let me see your back. Okay. Last checks. Let's go. All right, listen up. We watch our descent rate and follow all safety protocols. Remember, these suits are dangerous. Hey, what's so funny? - I can't do this. I can't. - Yes, you can. Yes, you can. Yes, you can. Yes, you can. It's all right. It's all right. It's just an elevator, all right? It's all lit up to the weigh station. You just follow the pipeline. You can do it. Come on, come on. Hey, what's the scariest part of a roller coaster? Waiting in line. Ready? I'm gonna be right there with you. Every step. Main bridge compromised. We have to move. All right. Everybody in the pool. Okay, we gotta go. That was one level above us. This one's next. Let's go. integrity compromised. Structural integrity compromised. Take us down. "If you don't know where you're going, any road can get you there." Dude. What? It's not me, Norah. It's from a book. Let's go. We all know you can't read. All right, I don't wanna scare anyone, but once we get to the depth we're gonna have to jump to the cargo lift. Okay, here we go. Shit. Exterior hatch, it's ripped to shreds. Everybody, get ready. Hang onto something 'cause pressure's gonna hit us hard. Override it. As long as it opens, we'll be fine. Captain, I don't know what's going on with this thing. Well, keep trying. Rodrigo. Guys, what's going on? Keep the door closed. Keep the door closed! Stay where you are. Close your eyes. It's okay, Em. You're good, you're good. Listen. Listen. Close your eyes. Let's go, Emily. Step to the edge. You have to jump now. Norah, he's gone. It's your turn. You need to jump. He knew that that helmet was faulty. I mean, I-I-I know that he knew it. Listen. I know how you feel. I know it's unfair. But you're gonna have to take it and use it. Yeah. Okay. Come on. The sooner we get clear of the station the better. I've never seen anyone die before. I saw somebody die. I've never seen anybody implode. What are you laughing at? Uh, I was just thinking of this thing that Rodrigo did sometimes. He'd always say he had a new joke, and then he'd tell the same stupid joke. I was... laughing at that joke. Yeah, what was it? What did the fish say when it bumped into the brick wall? "Dam." Pretty stupid joke. It looks like whatever it is might be on the deck below us. I think it's a distress signal from one of the pods. How far? Two hundred more meters. Why wouldn't it be going to the surface? Maybe it's only got half a charge. Uh... It's definitely stopped on the platform below us. Survivor. It could be a survivor. Guys, somebody's gonna have to suit up. All right, Emily, this is your time. What? I'm just messing with you. Here, take him. Take this bunny. I bequeath it to you. If he doesn't make it, I'll haunt you. Let's go, guys. We don't know how long until the Kepler blows. Let's go put our lives in danger. - Be careful. - We'll be right back. Paul's crazy. Right? Yeah. I guess so. Hey, Captain, what do we do? With the body, when we find it. We're talking about a possible survivor, Paul. Okay. Then hypothetically. Let's say we were to come across a body and it was dead. Just grab something we can take back to his family. It's okay. I know what to do. Oh, really? We got G.I. Joe over here. And we are about to touch... in three, two, one. We're locked in. All right. - Ready? - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah! Let's get this done before the Kepler comes down on our asses. Okay. Turn on all the camera feeds we have available. How long can someone survive in a pod? If he lost power, not long. Especially at this depth. Okay, guys, we're starting the decompression now. Are either of you two married? Was. Kids? Daughter. How-how old is she? Fourteen. That's a tough age for a girl. I mean, it's-it's a phase. It will pass. She's not 14. Allie? She's gotta be like my age, right? Who said 14? Did I say that? Yeah. Well, I don't know why I said it. You're losing it, old man. You're going senile down here. It's actually a normal neurological reaction. When you're facing death, time just... Listen to me. Listen to me. You're not gonna die. Okay? All right. Worst idea ever. Let's do it anyway. Helmets on. Locked and loaded. Either of you have dogs? Flood it, Norah! Flooding. I have a corgi. Not house-trained, so he's kind of a nightmare right now, but I didn't think I would miss him this much. Okay, hatch is sealed. We're outside. Okay, I'll put us on standby. Turn the floodlights on, please. Cap, this platform's not too stable. I, uh, don't know how long we should be out here. Oh, God. Guys, keep on walking forward. Like 20 meters. Check what's on the right. I can't see shit. My right or his right? What the hell is that? Am I cracking up or is there, like, like, a bird chirping right now? We're not hearing anything up here. All right, Captain, talk to us. We close? We can't see anything out here. Honestly, you should be right in front of it. Okay. I can't see shit. Oh, hold up. You see that? Holy shit. What the hell happened to this thing? Looks like it imploded. There's, uh, something. Something all over it. You seeing this? What is that? I would need to take a closer look. It could be some sort of an-an algae. You ever see anything like that? This looks... It doesn't look like algae. Is there anybody in it? Empty. I got something. Wallet. Great. We can use his credit cards. All right, Captain, there's no body, so can we please and thank you get the hell out of here before we... Scratch that. There's a body. It's entangled... They should just come back. in the coils. Dude, don't check it out. Just come back. - Just come back. - Wait. Do you see his back? - Can you guys see that? - Let's just bring them back. Okay, come back, guys. Paul. Whoa. Smith. Paul. The hell's going on with his body? Did the pressure... liquefy... Paul, hold still! God! What is that thing? All I know is that it was eating a dead body and then it came at me. Em, what are you doing? Uh, I'm just looking for its... Oh, no, no! See? Looking for its mouth. Is it still alive? - No, no, no. - 'Cause I will kill it. I think I just touched a nerve. Norah, how much further do we have? Two hundred meters away from the bottom. It doesn't have any eyes. How are they attracted to the light? Oh, my God, look at this. Maybe they're like moths. Underwater moths. It's like talons. I think this might be a new species. Do we get to name it? I shot it. I'm naming it. I've never seen sea life like this down here. Unless... Unless we bored into a hydrothermal pocket. If it was sustained heat that could support life... Are you serious? Everybody stay calm. Stay calm. - Oh, my God. - Norah, what'd you get? Nothing. It's not just the lights. The whole system's down. Can you put us in neutral? Glide the rest of the way? Yeah. We have access to the cable? If we can disengage, definitely. What was that? This better not be some Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea shit, man. - Paul. - What the hell? I'm just joking. But it does sound like there's something out there. It's probably not a good time to ask, but is that a baby? Should we close that door? I'm gonna close it. I'm gonna close that door. Okay. We gotta find a way to get down. We're completely disengaged. I don't know why we're not moving yet. Oh, my God! What the hell was that? - Oh, my God! - The Kepler exploded! The Kepler! Oh, shit, shit, shit! Captain! Into the pressure chamber! Oh, God! We have to open the outside hatch before we hit the seafloor! Or we get crushed! Move! Flood it! Flood it! Helmet, now! Here we go! Come on! Help! Hang on! Here we go. Open the hatch! All right. Run! Run! Run! Watch it! Watch it! Norah. Hey, guys! I'm over here. Come to the green light. I'm at the entrance. Watch out, Smith! Emily, watch out! Keep your eyes closed. Keep 'em closed. I don't know what happened. Come on, take him. To the pipeline entrance! Come on. I can't get the goddamn door open! Smith, can you hear me? It's gonna be okay, buddy. You're gonna be okay. Come on. Let's get him clear of the door! Get him up. Get him up. Get him up. Get him up. Get him up. What happened? Are you okay? He inhaled some fumes. He's okay. His oxygen scrubber took a hit. We all saw this, right? There are things out there. Fuck our lives! See? There's something out there. Oh, my God. Paul, stop. It's just debris falling. Norah, call the mover. All right. Look at me. How's your sight? I'm good. - It's gonna be all right, man. - Okay. I don't have the code. I-I can't get in here. Ears. Eh, forget it. - Give me your hand. - Two, three! It's gonna be fine, buddy. Yeah. All right. We ride this to the Midpoint Station. We're halfway there, guys. Halfway there. Paul, stop the cart. It's not gonna go in that kind of water. Stop it. That's a lot of water. The pumps are probably jammed. What happens if they don't turn back on? Anybody else wanna take that? No? In the book, Alice cried so much she almost drowned in her own tears. Luckily, she could swim. It got pretty rough for her after that. There's definitely something following us. Okay. I'm getting very close to shitting myself. Looks like somebody got a care package. Cheetos and... Oh, the irony. I love MoonPies. This is someone's stuff. This is all someone's... Oh... Oh... Oh, my God. Keep moving. Keep moving. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, guys, we're almost there. It should be 300 meters ahead. Is this it? We can't go back. What does that mean? It's too tight. Oh, no. We've got to find another way. I'm the smallest. Let me check. Here. Okay. Let me connect you with my line. Attached. Thank you. All right, I'm through. It's open out here. And I think you guys can definitely make it. It's really tight but... - Okay. - Huh? We're sending Emily. Yeah, okay. Attached. Captain's on his way. Hey, come here. Nice. Hey. How you holding up? I'm okay. Um, I was gonna eat this, but Lil Paul and I decided that you should give it to your girl. - MoonPie. - Yeah. MoonPie. Thanks, man. She's pretty cool. Gotta make sure not to screw that up. Yeah. Smith. Your turn. Come on. All right, Cap's through. I'm going. All right, guys. I'm coming through. How are you doing in there, buddy? You want your bunny heater? All right, forget this. We're going in. Hey. You okay? - Paul, can you hear me? - Yeah. - You okay? - Yeah. - What is that? - Huh? Paul? Paul, are you reading? Don't screw around. Let's go. Hey, Paul, you copy? We're gonna pull you through. - All right, pull. - All right. Here we go. - Come on. - I'm pulling. I'm pulling. Come on. Shit! Come on, come on. There he is. You scared the shit out of me. There's something back there. Some Slender Man-type shit. Hey, that's not funny. What's wrong with my line? Smith, unclip. He's all tangled up. - Okay, I got it. - Oh, no! Unclip, unclip, unclip! Take Lil Paul! Take Lil Paul! Give me my helmet! It's pulling me underwater! He's going! Helmet! - My helmet! - Helmet, now! Get it on! Get it on! Grab him! Grab him! Grab him! Grab him! I can't hold him! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Paul! Get out of the water! - Emily, go! - Get to the bulkhead! Calling CQ. Calling CQ. This is Captain Lucien. We're at the Midway Station. It's heavily damaged. Not sure how long it will last. Does anyone copy? It ripped him out of the suit. It ripped him right out of his goddamn suit. What could do that? Begin evacuation to surface immediately. CQ, do you copy? Overwatch tower is online. What is happening? That drill weighs 6,000 tons. How did it get ripped up like that? We did this. We drilled the bottom of the ocean. We took too much. And now she's taking back. We're not supposed to be down here. No one is. She's not wrong. Listen. I know Paul's gone, but... we can't stay here. What about Smith's suit? Let me take a look at your oxygen scrubber. - Hmm. - Come on. How is it? The suit's not gonna make it. You guys gotta go without me. We... I'm... I'm just gonna be dead weight out there. - I can't lose anybody else. - Me neither. Stop. Okay, Smith, you can lean on me. Take short, shallow breaths. Okay. It's gonna be all right. I got you. Okay, there's Marker 21. All we do now is follow these across the plateau. The Roebuck Station will be at Marker Zero. What did you see? Huh? I don't know. - I just saw it. - Oh, my God! I saw that. Set him down. What was that? What the hell was that? Where is it? Where is it? Turn off the lights. Don't move. I'm gonna turn my IR on. Norah, did you get my feed? Yeah. Smith? Where's Smith? Norah? - Where is he? - Do you see him? Where'd he go? - Smith! - Emily. - Smith? - Smith! Emily. Help. - That's his foot. - I'm going. I'm hooking onto you. Here. I see him. I got him. He's alive. He's alive. I'm pulling him back. Okay. Just push him. We'll grab his feet. Smith, can you hear us? Smith, please! Can you hear us? I gotta grab the gun. What? Forget the gun. Captain, leave it. Cap. Cap, what are you doing? - Norah! - No! No! No! Norah? You okay? I can't see you. Can you see me? Norah? Where are you? I'm underneath you. Can you see me? Cap, can you hear me? Norah. Where are you? I'm here. Underneath. I'm all tangled. Can you see me? Yeah. Okay, hold on. Where is it? I don't know. Get me out of here. - Okay. - Shit. Okay, let me see if I can help you. Hold on. Can you reach my knife? What was that? Norah. Is it back? What do you see? Is it back? Norah! Norah! Oh, I got you. I got you. I'm with you. I'm with you. Pressure level critical. We're rising too fast! The pressure's gonna kill us both! Please slow ascent. Norah. Let go. Suit integrity, ten percent. Norah, look at me. Let go, God damn it! No, I can't. I can't. I can't. Four percent. Three percent. No, no, no. No, no, no. Two percent. It's gonna be all right. No, don't do that. One percent. Don't do that! Don't do that! Emily, can you hear me? Emily, Smith, can you hear me? I'm still alive. I'm at the old Shepard drill. There's no... There's no pods here but I can breathe. I have some air. If you guys are out there... Is anyone reading? Emily, can you hear me? Can you guys hear me? Cap. Allie. I'm sorry. Guys, I'm just gonna keep talking. I don't know if you can hear me. I'm following the southeast line. Following the markers. To the Roebuck. I used to love the ocean. It was like a giant petri dish, you know? Em, is that you? I know that you have... a different Hawaiian shirt for every day of the week. Emily, I can hear you. Is that you? Though I... Even though I don't know you outside of this petri dish... Emily. But I know that you listen to me. And you make me laugh. I love you. You know? Em? Emily? I needed you to know. Emily? Hey. Emily, I'm right behind you. Hey, can you hear me? Hey, Emily. - Emily! - No! Please! Please stay back! Emily, stop! Emily. Hey, hey. Hey. Em? Em? Em? Open your eyes. Emily, open your eyes. It's me. Hey, I got you. - I got you. - Norah, I thought you... - You're okay. - Norah... Norah, I thought you... I thought you were dead. How's Smith? Is he okay? Yes, yes. He's here. He's alive. Okay. That's what matters, right? Yes. Come on, let's get up. Come here. I didn't get very far. Are you kidding me? I am so proud of you. I-I can't even believe it, honestly. Your air must be... Let me check your air, though. You must be so... No, I'm just... I figured... I'm just gonna walk. Okay. That's a good plan. The captain? Just grab Smith. Okay? Don't think about it. Come on. God, I feel high. Freebie. It's the low oxygen thing. I can't feel my fingers. What's your dog's name? Tenny. Yours? That's cute. Jim. Jim? James if he gets in trouble. He was my fiancé's dog, actually. You guys split up? No. No way. He, um... He was Smith's best friend, actually. We used to all dive together. He wanted to go out one night. I was tired. I let him go alone, and... he just took forever. I knew something was wrong. So I... I called Search and Rescue and went down to look for him. I just... couldn't find him. I'm sorry. You don't need to hear that right now. I'm so sorry. It's just that feeling of beingpowerless to change anything. It almost killed me. I made Smith swear to me he would never talk about it down here. You really love him, huh? Yeah. That's really cool. You just gotta keep pulling. What is that? What is that glow? It's the drill. It's the Roebuck. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, we made it. Come on. Come on. Fuck. We're almost there. Almost there. Just to the green light. What are they? Turn your lights off. Turn your lights off. Oh, my God. Where are they all coming from? The door is right there. Right there. They look like they're sleeping. Or hibernating. Let's just focus on getting inside. Warning. Oxygen levels critical. Warning. Oxygen levels critical. Beep, beep. That's probably not good. Keep going. Emily, keep going. Get Smith to the door. Emily, take him. Go. Emily, go. Go! Emily, go! Fuck! Fuck! What the...
