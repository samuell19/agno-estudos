You failed. Pass. Fail. Fail. Pass. There will be pain on the path to success. Stop! Father, you are too close. You smell bad, like old meat. You will hunt at my side. If you die, I will die. We will keep each other alive. He is not ready. One season each year... we hunt the Great Beast. We do this or we die. It is his time to do his part. It is his time to prove himself. He is not like you. He is not like the others. He is just a boy. A tender boy. He leads with his heart. Not his spear. Take this... so nothing will harm you. I can take care of myself. Keda. Be safe my son. He will come back. Promise me that you will both return. Go. If I could teach you only one thing... .upaﬁence. Father... My friend. You have survived another season to hunt with us. Yes. And I bring a young hunter... Raise your head... and your eyes will follow. This is my son. Mine will not see another hunt. He has gone to the other world. You must be a proud father. I hope he makes me proud. We have walked the sacred Path together since the First Hunt. This is you. Our hands point us to the hunting ground... ...and if the spirits are with us... ...point the way home when it is time. A trail of marks... how we survive. Some will be chosen to return. Others may be sent to hunt in the sky. These marks, they are us... our people... ...and a path for the people after us. Finish it. You take a life to give life to your tribe. Do it. Now. I'm Life is for the strong! It is an honor earned, not given. Be calm. Stay alert. Now you understand... Fear makes you weak. May his spirit watch over the Path... ...as his ancestors before him. The stone markers guide you during the day. Now you bear the marks... ...that will guide you at night. The light from our ancestors... ...showing us the way home. Home. You see that one? That is the Alpha, their leader. The wolves do not follow the strongest, but the wisest. The Alpha is always in danger. Others in the pack might challenge this... ...they believe that they should lead... ...so the Alpha must be careful and smart. He was not born the Alpha. He had to earn it. Go! Hold the line! Come here! Keda! Keda! Keda! Keda! Keda! Do not look down! Don't let go! Keda! My friend... ...my leader... It's impossible to reach him! He is gone. We can't lose you, too. We have a duty to our people. Keda! Load the sleds. We must return to our village. May the Spirits guide and protect your people until our next hunt. Tell him our sons shall walk together in the other world. You must let him go. Set him free. He is with the Spirits now. Father! Father! Father! Father! Hyenas, we must find shelter. A friend. Maybe not. Do not bite me. I am not going to hurt you. I will keep you alive. Fnend. See... It has to be cleaned. See... ...not that bad. Paﬁence. l have not forgiven you. It is up to me. You will wait for your turn. I am glad we understand each other. Home. You miss them, your pack... I hear my parents calling me in my dreams. But I can't get to them... It's getting colder. The Sacred Path will cover with snow soon... I don't know if I can make it home without my father. I'm not like him... ...but I have to try. I miss my parents so much. That belongs to me. I need that. l have to be home before the first snow. You should go home too. Go ahead! Stop looking at me! Go ahead! Where are you going? What do you want? What do you want? Go on, get out of here! I almost had him. Did you see that? ljustspred. I'm not afraid of anything. Hey, what are you doing? Come back here! Hey! Over here! Wait! No! You will wait your turn. I forgive you. You're a filthy stinking animal! Get in! I will call you Alpha. Keda. Alpha. Go to your family... I'm sorry... Please... Alpha! Tracks... Help! Hey! Fnend! No... Stay. Nothing... Nothing! No! Nothing! We will be alright. Thank you friend... Run! You left your family to stay with me. You left your pack. And sacrificed yourself for me. The Path. We're close. My ancestors are lighting the way... ...guiding us home. Do not give up. I will not leave you. We have come so far together... You have led and l have followed. Now I must lead. I know you're tired. I'm tired too. Just a little rest... He is just a boy. A tender boy. He leads with his heart. Not his spear. No... He is stronger than you know. He is stronger even than he knows. We're home. How... can this be? Father... Am I really home? Yes, my heart. You are home. Father... Life is for the strong. It is earned... You have earned it, my son. Alpha... Alpha needs... Help... You bring us the gift of the night howling beast. Bless this day when man and beast unite. It's okay...
