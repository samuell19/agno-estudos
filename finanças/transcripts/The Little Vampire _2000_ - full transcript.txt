Vampires! Here! Be careful! Watch out! Vampires! Gimme that stone! Keep hold of it! Don't let it go! No! Aah! Hon? What? Oh-hh... you have another nightmare? The vampires were back. Oh, this is ridiculous. I've got to get some sleep. Mom... do you like this place? Well, it's a big change for you, i know. New house... new country... hear that? It's the wind. Or the undead. Mom? Dad? Tony, if i don't get some sleep, then i'll be one of the undead. Come on, honey, you're gonna be late. Got everything? Jump in. Put your seat belt on. Hey... wave hi to dad and lord mcashton. Scotland is beautiful, isn't it? If you don't have vampires. And you know we really don't, right? But a dream isn't real. I know what a dream is, mom. Okay. I'm just asking. But you know there is no such thing as vampires, right? Mom! You're on the wrong side of the road! Whoa! What did he say? Everybody talks weird here. Don't worry, things are gonna get better. You'll meet some new friends here soon. Fight! Fight! Fight! This is for being a little creep! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! And this is for coming here in the first place! On saturday night, we'll be able to see comet forsey in conjunction with the moon for the first time in 300 years. And then-- and then the beam of light comes from the moon. As usual, our american friend is full of stories. What makes you say that? I dreamt it. Stupid yank. Fine. Now you've had your joke. No. I've dreamt it every night since i've been here. And then there's a gathering. A gathering of what? A gathering of vampires. Not again, tony. I really saw it! The comet, the beam of light, the vampires, and the vampire hunter. All right, that's it. You've earned yourself a chair in the hall. Fly away back to california, creep. Look what i got you. A golf club! Yeah. A junior set of golf clubs. You know, the game was invented in scotland. But there's no one to play with. Well, that's the beauty of golf. You don't need anyone to play with. But i want someone to play with. Then i'll teach you. You never have time. Now, look, tony, i'm trying here. There you are. The babysitter's downstairs. Good. When are you gonna be back? Not too late, hon. It's business. Lord mcashton invited us. All the investors are gonna be there. Hey, look at those. Those are great! I didn't know you could draw so good. Great. Good night, hon. I want you in bed by 9:00, and don't give yourself any nightmares. Mwah! I love you. Be a good boy. Lord mcashton. Bob. And dodie. Dottie. Of course it is. What do you think of our blimp? - Oh, i like the blimp-- - me too. How nice to see you. He likes my blimp. Okay, pet, it's time to-- oh! Oh! Tony! What a fright you gave me! I didn't see you sitting there, pet. Och, dear, you near stopped my heart, and it's near enough stopping as it is. That's the truth of it, and you wouldnae want to do that to miss lorna now, would you? Eh? Listen, you can have a wee read of your book once you're settled, but meanwhile brush your teeth and away to bed. Bed for the undead? Ahh... ha ha ha! Got you now, you filthy thing! Let the chase begin. Right. Ab ovo... in toto... what clan... are you from, brother? Have the lights gone? Who are you? You are not a brother. Well, i'm not a sister. You're human. You're full of blood! Gonna keep it that way, dude! I'm too weak... i'm not afraid... i'm not afraid... do you need help? What twisted kind of mortal are you? I know you. I saw you in my dream. Must've been a nightmare. It was. I must leave. But you can't even walk. Who needs to walk... when i can fly? Whoa... aah! You okay? Do i look it? Rookery. Do you... do you know where i can get a cow? If you want a glass of milk... no, not milk. A cow. Hurry. Your eyes are getting heavy... you're falling into a deep sleep... ugh... i think i'm gonna hurl. Aww... it's just a little one. Well, let's see how you like this! So... that's not enough for you, eh? Let's see you escape from me now! Aah! Shut your eyes, tony! That was very clever. But i'll catch you! You can open your eyes now. Wow! Enjoying the view? Yeah. And thanks, dude. You saved my life. That truck was gonna splatter me. You keep calling me dude. My name's rudolph. Dude is slang. Like you call a friend. A friend? Well, we saved each other's lives, didn't we? Yes, we did. Friends. My name is tony. Come on. Let's play. Yes. We play. Ah-ah-ah! My best friend's a vampire! Yeah! Yeah! I haven't heard music like this since my brother's wedding. You see, it has a proper rhythm. That's what i like. Ah, the grandsons! We came to say good night, grandfather. Now, boys... this is tommy's mother and father. That's tony. Tony. Of course it is. The boys tell me that they have become great friends with your son. He's our favorite plaything. Boy there you have it. Off to bed. Well, lovely to meet you. Tell tony we'll see him tomorrow. Bright and early. Ha! Will do. They seem like terrific kids. They are, they are. If you'll excuse me, i need another... cheers. Cheers. So... how is my son fitting in? Okay? He doesn't tell you? Oh, he tells me plenty, but, you know kids. I'm talking about tony's obsession with vampires. Excuse me. I think i should get home. Rudolph, how do we get down from here? We'll fly. But i can't fly. I got you up here, didn't i? Well, i guess so. Then stay calm... friend. All right, let's fly. As long as i'm holding onto you, you're fine. Trust me. Ready? Whoa, i'm flying! Wow-ww...! Wow! It's great to be a vampire! Membership does have its privileges. Look. My mom and dad went to a party there. I'm terribly sorry. Excuse me. Oh, mr. Thompson, awful sorry to bother you, but i didnae know what else to do! What? He's not here and i've looked everywhere and... no, no, i came up and he was-- until up about half an hour ago. I can't understand you. Say it again. In english. Slowly. Come back with mrs. Thompson. Help me find him! Yeah! Vampires are different than i thought they'd be. Father's seen to that. We're a family, not fiends. That's why we only try to drink cow's blood. But i thought vampires drink human blood. We do, but we've got to make do with cows. Why? Because we've been hunted for centuries. We always have to hide. We want to become humans, not eat them for dinner. He wasn't like this at home. This is scotland, not san diego. What do you expect? He's an eight-year-old kid. Oh, mr. Thompson, mrs. Thompson! I've been waiting on you coming back! Cannae understand. Sent him away early, like you said, to bed. And then i was up checking him and-- tony? I mean, just for half an hour and i cannae underst-- i saw what i saw and i saw what i didnae see. And-- and i-- i didnae see-- what's that? I smell it, too. So... those are your parents? They look nice. And tasty? No, nice. As in very nice. They have their moments. I suppose i must take my leave. I haven't had so much fun with a boy my own age since i really was nine. Thanks... dude. You can stay if you want. Maybe i should. Do vampires always sleep in coffins? 'Cause that's gonna be a problem. Just as long as the sun can't find me. This would be excellent. I have to take out all this junk. Junk? It's a treasure chest. I've hidden in trees and watch mortals play this game. What is it? Nintendo. Duh! Nintendo duh. Can i play with this nintendo duh? It's nintendo. "Duh" is just a word people say when someone asks a dumb question. Duh. More like "duh"! Duh! Duh! Duh. I'll teach you nintendo tomorrow. I know. You must sleep now. It's late for mortals. Until the night. So you're, like, a thousand years old or something, right? I've just been nine for over 300 years. I want to be a vampire, too. No. You don't know what that means. Doing the most awesome stuff i've ever done in my life. No blue skies, tony. No birds singing. No flowers in the sunlight. Just this constant night. Cool. Good morning! Now, why are you sleeping this way? Did you have another nightmare last night? Yeah. Aww... poor baby. No. I dreamt i was... flying. You did? That's wonderful! That's a good kind of dream to have. Now, come on, get up. Rise and shine! Time to go to school! Hiss-ss! The sun! Sorry, dude. Honey, you hungry? I could eat a cow! Nancy... good morning, vampy. You mean wimpy, don't you? Ha! Out of my way, losers! You dirty little-- fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fighting with the mcashton boys, of all people! They started it. Keep still. It's still bleeding. Let me get another tissue. Now, last night your teacher told me that you'd been talking an awful lot about monsters. No wonder they keep teasing you. Not monsters. Vampires. It's all the same. No, it's not. You know, it's gonna be rough making friends like that. I have a friend. You do? What's his name? Rudolph. Where does he live? Not far. What's he like? He's... a... he's very, very cool. Well, invite him for a sleepover. I already did. There it is again. What? That smell. I don't smell anything. Nice, easy stroke. Okay, give it a shot. All right! Pretty good! When does the sun go down? Not for a while. But i need to be home before it sets. What's the big hurry? You bored already? No. I know what you've been thinking about me. Tony, i'm sorry i've been so rough on you lately. I got the job on one hand and this teacher-- i know. Mom told me. Yeah. Dad, do you think i'm crazy? Oh, no, tony. I just think that vampires belong in a movie somewhere, not in your room. How did you know he's in my room? I'm kidding. Not very funny, right? Kind of funny. Let's play golf! Okay, that's the spirit! Let's set up again. Rudolph! Psst! What? Rudolph! Can we go flying again? No, it's too dangerous. I only came because of this. Hmpf! My drawing? You can have it. Where have you seen it? Why do you wanna know? It's very important. I'll only tell you if you take me flying again. Yippee! Whoa-aa... we live down there. Cemetery? Cool! I could get used to that. So you didn't see the real thing, then? I dreamt it all. The amulet... the comet... does it mean something? I can't say. It's a secret. Who am i gonna tell? Who's gonna believe me? All right. It is the comet attamon. It's the comet of the lost souls. It could mean the end of this curse. What curse? The curse of being a vampire. It is a piece of the comet that fell to earth. A great magician made it into an amulet of power, and we lost it, 300 years ago to the sea. Yes, yes, i saw it! My uncle von tried to catch it... and we've never seen him since. From that night to this, our wandering has never ended. I'll help you find it. That must be what my dream really means. Yes, you're to join our quest. We'll truly be brothers now. Hide! My parents are coming! But we're brothers! They don't know that! Go! Mama! Papa! Rudolph! Thank the stars you're safe! My son, you must not stray so far away. We were afraid-- i was only taking the road less traveled. You got lost. My poor rudolph! Yoo-hoo! - Anna! - Brother, darling. You're the nervy one... sneaking off like some daywalker. I wish. So, father, did you find the stone? No, but i'm sure we're on the right path. We still have 48 hours. Well, you see, that's-- i will not fail you! Gregory! No, gregory! He's my friend! A mortal! I'm rudolph's friend, and he gave me a bite-proof guarantee. You could be anything to my son. Victimizer, slave... dinner, perhaps. But you can never be his friend. He likes vampires, and he dreams about us. Am i in your dreams, mortal? And he knows about the amulet. Ah... then he's a spy. Rookery's knave. Darling, he doesn't look like a spy. And besides, even rudolph couldn't make up such a story. Could you, sweetheart? Mortal or not, he's just a boy. But if you insist on eating him, go ahead-- i never said i would. It's impossible. - Leave, i say. - But, rudolph-- should've never befriended you. Leave, i say! Aah! Rookery! Get back! Get back! Go! Take the family! Run! Do as i say! Stay away from my family! Do your worst! The age of chivalry is not yet dead-- you! What kind of bloodsucker are you? Ow! Tony, are you all right? Look out! Come on! Aah! Oh! Wow. Hey! What's your problem? None of your business, pal. It is when it's in my cemetery. Visiting hours are from dawn till dusk. Now... get a move on! What you did was foolish! Foolish... but brave. We shared a vision. He has a sympathy for our kind. Oh, lovely. Young von found the stone... then made his way to scotland... plucked from the sea by a merchant ship just as rumor had it. Then he could still be roaming free. There was a woman i'd never seen before... she wore a strange coat of arms. We must find which family she belongs to, trace her crest. I can help. No... it's too risky to involve a mortal. What have we got to lose? We've been searching for three centuries-- this is what comes from contact with mortals! Disrespect! Insolence! Frederick, he does have a point. All right. Help if you can, but do not think to change your mind and betray us to our most hateful enemy, or my wrath will be revealed. Am i clear? I think my father likes you. That... was liking me? I know he can seem like a real monster because he's so stern with us. He is a monster. But you don't know what it's like for us vampires to be so tormented. Oh, yeah, i do. It happens to me every day at school. Who dares torment my friend? Flint! Flint! Wake up! Wake up! I am the lord of the underworld. I am your master. It's tony thompson. Get him! I don't think so. I am the fiendish friend of tony thompson. If you do not treat him with respect, you'll feel my wrath! Tell anybody what you have just witnessed, and you will be bat bait. What on earth is going on in here? Nothing. Cora. Nancy. Sleep well last night, girls? Carry these. Yes, master. In three months' time, the weather gods permitting, mcashton's will become scotland's calling card to not only the golf world, but... playing games... while corruption festers beneath your feet? Typical. What do you mean, busting in here? Much as i hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, you need to know. You have an infestation of vampires. Do you know who you're talking to? I might ask you the same thing. Obviously a madman. I'll show him the door myself. Obviously, a madman. Now what's all this talk about vampires? You don't seem terribly surprised, my lord. Well, one has heard rumors. Legends. Nonsense, of course. But wouldn't you like it sorted out once and for all by a trained professional? In fact, by the only trained professional? Now, i will admit that my fee is substantial. Fee? I have to pay you a fee? For what? For putting an end to your worries. And face facts, my lord, you do have worries. Has there been any biting in town? No. Not to my knowledge. Well then, show me a biting. There'll be no question of fees until i see proof. Now... leave. They think this is still some kind of public service. Afternoon tea... mm... very civilized, very... stags are deers with horns, right? Male deers. Yeah. Lots of scottish crests have those. - Lots? - Yeah. It means they descended from hunters. So... tony, why so interested in crests all of a sudden? It's sort of... a new hobby. Tony? What are you really up to? Mcashton has stags on his crest, see? Can i have this? Sure. Go ahead. And, dad, can i go to work with you tomorrow? Uh, it's saturday. Yeah. Why? To check out your project. Great. Will lord mcashton be there? - He lives there, buddy. - But don't let that stop you. I won't. Tony! Well... be proud he finally has an interest in something normal. Enough weirdness going on around here. No wonder he's having nightmares. What do you mean? My presentation got interrupted today by a guy claiming the village was infested by vampires. You're making that up. What guy? I've got no family. No one to be with. Just me and all these dead people. I'll drink to that. To dead people. And... to the living dead. Oh, come on. You're either alive or dead. There ain't no in-between, pal. Unless you're a vampire. Vampires? Heh heh! You must be joking. I knew you'd laugh. It's only natural. But we've been hunting them for over 400 years. That long? It's a family business, you might say. For a hunter, you wear an awful lot of jewelry. This thing... the vampires have one just like it. But with one small difference. Theirs is designed to help them. This is designed to send them straight to hell. All i need is the stone, and the magic is complete. Heh heh heh! Now it's-- it's magic. There is a whole other world out there... if you just know how to look for it. What's that? There. What is it? Ohh... we're in luck. Come on! Wha-what is this? This wasn't here yesterday. This? Oh, yeah. I built this. I'll explain it later. Now... it must've gone down here. I'm going after it. Wait! It's my graveyard. It's my job. I'll do it. Ahem! Well, uh... if you insist. But take this safety line. Not that i'll need it! There you are. Heh heh heh! And... down we go. Down i go... heh heh heh! Yeah. Whoa... come on... you know you want it. Aah! Oh, ha ha ha! Yeah! Oh, ho! The line grows taut. His heart pounds. He knows what's on the other end of the line, and he relishes the fight! Hey-- oof! Let me down! Here we come. Yes! Let go, gregory, let go! It's a trap! Gregory! Let go! Oh, yeah! Mmm... here you come, here you come... bingo! You bit him? Just a taste. Was it worth betraying your family? Well, you're the traitor, forever denying the truth of us. You've turned us into cowards, skulking around our holes like worms! What would you have us do? Fight back! Make these mortals' blood run cold! And you could do it, gregory. You're young, strong, ruthless... and willing to risk a stake through the heart to prove it. Better a stake than this prison! Do you think me oblivious? What does it matter to you what i think? If i think? It matters greatly. I feel your sting. But you are frederick the great. You feel nothing! Let there be light! Run! We've uncovered a whole flock! Oh, thank you so much for your public spirit. Aah! Oh, my hero! Wow. Who did that? Hey! I found out about the coat of arms. It's lord mcashton's, my father's boss. The missing stone must be at his house. Did you hear me, sir? You barely saved my life. He's very, very weak. I know just what you need. Now... i must find a place to hide you children. You can stay at my house. We need darkness, dampness, and decay. Then you need our cellar. I'm sorry, it's-- perfect! I need to go upstairs, but have a good day's sleep. And don't worry, i'm on it. On... on what, dear? Finding the amulet, mother. That's how we kids talk today. Oh. - Bye, dude. - Bye, dude. Bob. Bob, i hear something moving. I don't hear anything. Tony might be having a nightmare. Go check on him, poor little guy. It's not my turn. It is your turn. Really? Really. Tony. Hnn? Oh. I thought you were my dad again. Don't be surprised. I only want you to have this... it's from the old country. It will bring you luck. And if you ever need me, just whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you? Ohh! Sweet mother in heaven! Good morning! Hey... good morning, mom. Wow, today's the day i get to go to work with dad! Yeah, i know. Why don't you invite rudolph? He couldn't make it. Ah, the mysterious stranger. Oh, he's around. Well, it would be nice to meet him one of these days, maybe have his parents over for dinner. Actually, they'd rather have you for dinner. Either way is fine. Come on, hurry up. Let's go. Okay. Lord mcashton. Ah! Take these, please. Hey, i'd like you to meet my son tony. Finally... little tony thompson. Let's feel that firm american grip. Shake lord mcashton's hand. Tony's very excited to hear about your family history. Aren't you, tony? Uh... not right now, i'm not. Well, it's a noble history indeed. The mcashtons have ruled in these counties since time... immemorial. You'll have to excuse me. Tony... you stay away from that guy. He's crazy. I told you not to come back! Unless-- "unless" is exactly what's happened, my lord. Aah! Not the kind of holes that are good for the golfing business, eh, my lord? A biting right here in mcashtonland. And there'll be more... unless we come to some arrangement. It's elizabeth... and her demon lover, isn't it? They've returned. I told you you had worries. Oh, come in. If we got up here... on 18... uh... yeah. Now... if we can... crest up, okay, before the green, i think we can lose the sand traps from 18, and that way... our ancestor, elizabeth mcashton. The stone of attamon! My grandfather told me the legend. He said it was to die with me. It could still happen. She saw a ship... foundered upon the rocks... though there had been no storm... no sign of life. No crew, save one who crawled ashore injured. But he was no mortal man. His name was von. Von sackville-bagge. A vampire. Elizabeth was taken by this von and became one of the undead herself. And then what? Our family staked her. And von. Warm-hearted bunch, aren't you? You of all people should understand. I'm joking, my lord. I would've done the same myself. So where is she buried? Why? Like you said, we want to know if she's walking around. If i was a mcashton, i wouldn't want her looking for me. How do you like your stake, my lord? Ha ha! Boo! You're blocking the lord of the underworld! We-- we don't mean to! I want you to crawl back to your room, get under the bed, and stay there! Y-yes, lord underworld. I said, crawl! Ahem! Allow me, my lord. I'm an expert. All part of the service. Here. She was moved. But no one's been down here since mother died. I'm talking about centuries ago, my lord. And judging from what i see... the tomb is just here for show. She's in an unmarked grave wrapped in chains with a wooden stake through her ribs, the coffin purified. Why? Well, do you really want your mom to be buried next to a vampire? No! No! I loved mother! She always smelled of gardenias. Oh, shut up. Then they buried her in unhallowed ground, probably outside the churchyard walls. That's acres worth of land! Which is why i come equipped with state-of-the-art vampire locators that you're paying so dearly for, my lord. The little vampire sympathizer! Yaaah! Aah! Ohh... now... you've made your bed, now... you can sleep in it! No! Nooo! You can't do that. - Let me out! - It's murder! He's just a boy! Thompson's son. He's one of them. I've seen them all together slithering in the night. I must tell his parents! Let me out! Now... there are plenty of ways to get your throat punctured, my lord. Don't make me be the one. Let me out! All right, j-just tell me what to do. Right. That's better. Now, go away... and remember... what? Tony's calling. He could be in danger. Maybe he's found the stone. Let's go. Oh, the drama-- shh! Oh, dear! The sun. Daylight or not, we must go. Where are you going? You stay here. Shh! Left, right, left, right, left, right... left, right, left, right, left, right, left... left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right... tony! Whoa--oh--stop. What do you mean by running off like that today? You had me worried sick. Well, that's not good-- wait, i suppose... this is rudolph under here. Okay. Well, this isn't your fault, rudolph. But when you get home tonight, tony thompson, we're having a serious talk. Okay. Well... go on and play your game... left, right... whatever it is. Left, right, left, right... and what's that all about? Tony ran off from work today and i got really worried. But i was so happy he was playing with a friend and not obsessing about vampires. Amen, husband of mine. Which means we get the afternoon alone. Mm. I like this rudolph already. His parents want to have us for dinner. Tony! Are you all right? Yeah. Dude, you heard me! I heard you, my hero, and i wrote you a poem. Who did this to you? Rookery. We better find elizabeth's tomb before he does. It's about the power of love. Who's elizabeth? The last holder of the stone. The woman in my dreams. "Your face saw i in the cemetery, filled with fright... rudolph, look! For the night was scary. Still, you faced the foe undaunted. It was there... it wants to lead us somewhere. It was you i wanted... to hold me when the winds are..." behind the pillar, look! Hey! It's a door. A secret passage! This could lead to elizabeth's grave. I wish we had a better light. Wait, rookery seems to have left this behind. Thanks. Gone. All of them. They could've gone to the cliffs. Tonight's the night. Mortality beckons. Gregory. He's stolen the amulet. He will crush our hopes. His final mockery. No. He's a rebel, but... but treachery is beyond him. If he has taken the amulet... it's to make the call. Then we should go to the cliff too. I'm still very weak. I would fall from the sky if i flew. We'll find a way. Not like him to stay out this late. What's "like him" these days, ever since he met that rudolph? I thought you liked him. I never really met him. Well, i mean, i did, but he was wrapped in foil. I know, but we've never even seen him we've never met his parents. Probably foreigners. Foreigners? We are the foreigners. That's it. I'm calling the cops. Or the coppers, whatever you call them. Bobbies. Yes, hi, this is dottie thompson. I'm calling about my son. You can't understand me? You know what? Forget it. I'll call you back. I'm freda sackville-bagge. That's... wonderful. Rudolph's mother. I'm sure you're worried about tony. Tony? Your son. We know who he is. We want to know where-- tony is going to the cliff with rudolph and anna to watch the comet. Anna? Our daughter. Dare i say your charming young man has cast quite a spell on her. Well, we think he's charming. Frederick sackville-bagge. At your service. Hi. How about it, bob? Want to see a comet? Sure. Are... we supposed to be in costume, like you guys? Costume? Uh... shakespearean aristocratic thing like you guys? I don't wear the costume of an aristocrat. I am an aristocrat. Okay. Whatever. We should hurry. It's urgent. Urgent? Well, the comet is near. Oh. We must be near the cemetery. Follow me. To the ends of the earth, my darling. Where's your car? We flew. Let's take yours. Hold up, thompson! I've got a job for you. You might not like it. Oh, we didn't like it 300 years ago, but we did our duty. That's the point. Duty. One... two... three. It's over. What are you talking about? One... two... three. You have to drive this stake through tony's heart. Oh, my! No worries. He's already dead. He's a vampire, bob. It's not easy for a father to hear, but your son's a bloodsucking fiend. Okay, don't worry. I'll handle this. Take them. You'll thank me in the morning. I've had enough of all you people, now drop that ax and take your leave. Yeah, take your leave, or you'll be building your own golf course, buddy! Right. I'm leaving. You hear that, dottie? Oww! I told him to take his leave. You were wonderful! Bob... the comet. My lady. Those aren't aristocrats. Those are vampires! Those are vampires! Those are vampires! We have to keep moving. Time is running out. We can't go any further. Why not? There's something ahead. Some kind of curse. You have to go first, tony dearest. I found it! Go see what it is. It's a curse. Stupid chains. Break. Break! Come on! We need a miracle. The curse is gone! Yes! Whoa! It's elizabeth. Uncle von. Father was right. He did come here. Oh, how romantic! Their love, preserved forever. The stone isn't here. Up here! Up here! Ohh... getting away! Get her! Get her! Here! The stone is in my room! No wonder i had those dreams! Thank you for sharing that with me. Heh heh heh! What? What's happening? The call. You go to the cliffs. We'll get the stone. Okay, let's go. Robert, could you drive a little faster, please? Darling, do you hear? Hear what? The call. It's gregory, our eldest son. He's calling the clan. Yeah. Mother! Father! We found uncle von's grave. I mean, tony found it, and he saw the stone in a vision. He and rudolph are after it now. May their quest be fruitful. Thank you, gregory. Something weird is happening here. Bob! Oh, guuah! Aah! Oh! Don't worry, everything is gonna be fine. Okay, just stay calm. Freda says we're gonna be fine. Hi. Uh... my name's bob... and this is my wife, dottie. Good night for a gathering, huh? Leave them alone. They're friends. What? Since when? Where is it? Somewhere around here! How do you know? How do i know? I have visions, dude. No need to bite my head off. Biting is your job. Mine is to find the amulet. We've got to find it. Rookery! ♪ I'm coming... ♪ oh! Aw, boys... you've locked the door. I found it! The stone of attamon. Hand it over. It belongs to my friend. No, no, no, no. It belongs to me now. Give. Not without a fight. Oh? Well, i can't be bothered. Tony! Don't give him the stone! Aah! Let me go! Get in there! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Give me that stone. No! I said give me that stone! My friends need it. Oh, boo-hoo! I need it, laddie... what do you want? You want this? Well, come and get it. Ngggh... yaaah! Aah! Yee-haa! Whoa! Whoa! Aah! Hey! Hey! Oh, no, you don't. Give me that. Ha ha ha! Tony, the lights! Turn off the lights! Hey! You leave that alone! Stop that! Sit back! Tony! Hey! You! Whoo-hoo! Oh-oh-oh... whoa-aah... going... going... gone! We have only a few moments more. After all of our wandering... all of our waiting... i've left our fate in the hands of two small boys. It's all my fault. I won't even ask your forgiveness. I don't deserve it. Rudolph. You've got it. All right! Yeah! Aah! Yeah! Tony's near. Where? What'd she say? There! In the sky! Ready... hover! Oh! I think you've been looking for this. He has the amulet! The stone! Thank you, my friend. We must get a move on. Tony! Mom! Dad! The stone of attamon is ours! Ab ovo... in toto... nil desperandum... sine die... hey... that's my blimp! Aah! Mom! Dad! All right, that's it. I don't think so. Catch it, tony! Aaaaah! The ceremony! Tony! You know what we want! Wish it! You have to wish it... now! What'd you wish for? What else do you want? Hey... it's me... tony. ♪ My grandma and your grandma ♪ ♪ sittin' by the fire ♪ ♪ my grandma said to your grandma ♪ ♪ i'm gonna set your flag on fire ♪ ♪ talkin' 'bout hey now! ♪ ♪ Hey now! ♪ ♪ Iko, iko, unday ♪ ♪ jockamo feeno ai nan ay ♪ ♪ jockamo fee nan ay ♪ ♪ look at my king all dressed in red ♪ ♪ iko, iko, unday ♪ ♪ betcha $5 he'll kill you dead ♪ ♪ jockamo fee nan ay ♪ ♪ talkin' 'bout hey now! ♪ ♪ Hey now! ♪ Nancy!
