Who?s it? Please speak up What? What are you saying? How could it be? He?s come back to life You must be kidding Don?t say a word The reporter?s here Where?s the patient, please? Who was his doctor? How could this have happened? ls it true his eyes were donated? Please tell me how it happened? All this is not true lt?s nothing but a hallucination l?ve been too busy l should?ve stopped dreaming Police. What happened? Your name, please? Where are you? Need our help? Speak up Now your dream has come true You make me a martyr in love You don?t have to shun me anymore Come out of there Have you got tired of it now? We?ve been chasing it for centuries How could this have happened? What do l do now? Had there been no transplant the situation wouldn?t have come to that l?m now a laughing stock Pronounced a living patient dead and removed his eyes l?m damned Don?t blame yourself Everybody knows you didn?t want it Don?t sympathize with me l don?t He was my patient l should take full responsibility l really don?t understand how l could be so muddle Don?t blame yourself l am not good for a doctor Now l?ve got nothing - no future, no hope Goodbye What are you doing? You startled me l must enter the hospital again for a check-up l?ve read your report You wouldn?t have died so soon Your physical condition is good Look at me Do l look like normal? Do l look like normal or not? Do l look like normal? No jokes now, please l?m notjoking Someone wants to kill me l?m serious That patient was dead Someone?s out to kill me Don?t worry, you won?t die l?m notjoking Stop fooling around then l saw the body. lt was me This happens only in movies lt wasn?t in movies l saw with my own eyes! How did it happen then? l don?t know l only know now someone wants to kill me Please stop fooling around Leave me alone l want to be alone for a while Cut it out then! l?m going crazy! l wish l could die too Someone?s trying to kill me, l?m serious Go tell someone else! Who else would listen, if you don?t! Shut up, please, and leave me alone! So many happened in a day l don?t understand what?s happening! lmpossible, it can?t be true They say they removed his eyes because he was dead You?ve all seen it, this is sheer absurd That?s no way to be a doctor Why didn?t you check he was really dead or not? That?s the duty of a doctor Now he?s blind! What a paramountjoke it is! We take him to hospital to save him A doctor like her should retire early! Amid the mystery surrounding this case One thing is clear A corpse cannot be revived They even force us to close down Have you anything to say? Any recommendations? We must make scientific investigations without being subjected to public opinion What? Scientific investigations? What result do you expect? No one can tell lt sounds mysterious and incredible Don?t forget, you?re a doctor No one would care to hear your story Something wrong with your thinking This is not a mysterious occurrence nor any eerie happening Dr Kim can?t convince me He really dead Dead? His heartbeat is now loud and clear How do you explain that? l know But he?s come back to life There were symptoms of death So you pronounced him dead and wash your hands The transplant team confirmed that too So it?s their fault? l did my job How can you say that? Who?s to blame now? How can you accuse me of it? Now it?s me bearing the blame What do you want from me then? l don?t want to see you any more Get the hell out of here! Dr Ryu Tell him he can?t scare me This is for you, sir Thank you At first l thought it was a hallucination l?m meeting Yun-soo Want to join me? Don?t think l?m muttering nonsense here l really saw it, believe me Next time they appear, let me know l?d like to see the ghost Frankly, l didn?t believe it either but in my dream last night... Please recollect yourself l hate to see you in such a state No way let your imagination carry you too far Take care. Goodbye l hope l still look good When l?m old Will you still be with me? Death won?t seem so cold with a lover beside l remember the 1st time we met lt seems like yesterday but it?s been 7 years That old sofa has got to go That old bed, too One thing l hated to talk about lt?s getting married lt seems l?m getting old Happy birthday, darling! Stop it! Come down! Oh, my eye! Stop smoking! Be nice Just one Give it back to me! What are you doing? Want to try? l want to see how it tastes Sorry, no l saw you last night in my dream l told you my great-great grandfather made your bed lt?s from a gingko tree that General Hwang laid a curse on lt was a long time ago How did you know l had that bed Mi-dan told me that People can?t see or hear her She lives in a dreamland of void You saw her that day because she used a living man to transfigure She can?t do that anymore She can?t stay in this world Like General Hwang She was given eternal life by the spirits of good and evil Thus, their love and hate persist forever My great-great grandfather carved the faces hoping they would be together forever She had to kill someone a few days ago to save you She angered the spirit of love who left her You can never see her again Who was Jung-mun? You were a musician in your last life You were the best Your music was soft as the water and like the sounds of the wind lt was not only pleasant to the ear but heart-warming, fascinating and touching to Heavens, earth and the spirits Listen to it now Can you hear it? That was you That piece has been buried for centuries lt was the music of angels No one could imitate it General Hwang started a war over Princess Mi-dan He took her as his prize but she never opened her heart to his selfish and possessive love Your Highness, today is the 1,000th day of your state in my country Now l choose death After my death, l?ll become your shadow to protect you by your side forever l love you forever and ever A legendary love story happened 1,000 years ago After their death, the god of love turned Mi-dan and Jung-mun into 2 gingko trees to bring them together forever So they shared weal and woe come rain or snow They were blessed by heaven & earth to never, never part and never be lonely But in the mundane world, nothing?s perfect and nothing remains unchanged forever for love beckons jealousy, and happiness, envy General Hwang returned as a hawk to force their separation She wore a medieval dress She?s beautiful with long hair When she entered my body it felt like electricity and my cells heated up After she left me l knew l?d died How did you know you died? You could only feel it There are no words to describe it Maybe you were in dreams Dreams? Only the living can dream l told a reporter of my experience but he thought l was mad l may be blind now but l bear no one any grudge for inside l see more clearly than eyes do Where on earth are you? Can you see me or not? Can you touch me? What do l need to see you clearly? Please tell me lt?s been a long time Of us three, you only have a heart for him You yearn to touch him, embrace him and feel his breath You could talk with him the whole night l won?t let you do it You must leave the musician you love Heaven has brought us together like Romeo and Juliet to live together forever and ever Now it?s your turn to suffer as l did How does it feel? l was in such agony when you left me Mi-dan, you?ve forsaken the god of love because of this musician But l?ll still protect you now Three flowers grew on three mountain peaks l asked my late brother not to do it but he hit me l felt like standing in water Suddenly a light appeared a brilliant light that brought me to that direction l didn?t know what happened l found myself in a coffin My late wife greeted me and told me to change my name l knew l?d die in an accident That man followed me and soon entered my body l was clearly dead then but no one believes me That old man told me smilingly that l?d soon join him and be his friend again Mi-dan was here a few minutes ago She told me she had burnt your bed asking you not to return to your studio Do as she wishes Where?s she now? She wants to stop General Hwang Time?s running out Go now What?d happened to her if l burnt that bed? lf you do, she?ll ascend to Heaven She?s not of this world Forget about her l can?t lt?s for the good of everyone She waited 1,000 years for me How could l leave her like that? You have no other choice l must face General Hwang even if it?d mean my very life Why do you want to throw me out? What have l done wrong? Let me go! There?s no use crying You?re no longer the doctor here You?ve no right to speak l?ve done nothing wrong Don?t put all the blame on me alone You?ve no medical ethics None will believe you Go away! l?ll show you who?s right or wrong Where are you? Come out, General Hwang! Don?t hide like a coward What do you want? What do you want? You want my life? Or that bed? Come out! Come out, if you think you can have Mi-dan this way What else are you waiting for? Come on! Chop off my head if you?ve the guts! Come on! l?m waiting for you General Hwang What are you doing? Let me go, l beg you! Forget me! There?s a stupid man who has loved a woman for 1,000 years But she deserted him His love was ignored and despised The world has been unfair to me The people jeered behind my back at my incompetence and stupidity But they don?t do so anymore l?m now the boss l want you to experience the agony l long suffered from loneliness See if you can betray me anymore Follow me, you?ve no other choice Listen, how melodious the music is lt?s for me Heaven is playing that dance music for my love They?re awaiting our return Come back, come back to our world The world with only you and me Come here and show me your hand Grasp my hand What are you waiting for? Come over Don?t make me wait here l don?t want to spill any more blood l?ll come with you, but l want one favor Let me see the last of him - even for a moment Then l?ll come with you What if l don?t grant it? You?ll never, never have my soul You?ve killed us twice before l?m sure you?ll continue to do it But what have you gained? He?s not even from our world l?ll never see him again, if not now Let me see the last of him, l beg you This is the last time After that, l?ll come with you General Hwang, promise me that Then l?ll do anything you wish Mi-dan made that patient die and come back to life l don?t believe it Go now. You can?t stay here l can?t leave now l must see for myself whether this is true or not Get out of here before he hurts you You look like a different person now Do you have in mind another woman? You?re no longer that Su-hyun You?re that musician Jung-mun Tell me, what does Mi-dan look like? lt feels different in a woman?s body Everyone?s soul is of a unique color This is especially true with this lady doctor Jealous? Now you feel the way l?ve been for 1,000 years Sun-young l waited 1,000 years, a good 1,000 years Get out of her body l could stay forever but l won?t. Don?t worry Listen Tonight, during the eclipse, Mi-dan will see you But it?s going to be the last time Aren?t you excited?
