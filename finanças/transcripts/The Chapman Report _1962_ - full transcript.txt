[orchestral music] Section 4, Para 1, question 2. Ten percent of the married women were strongly aroused twenty-seven percent somewhat, sixty-three percent not at all. That's within a percentage point of Chicago and St. Louis figure. (pilot on speaker) 'They report a ground temperature' 'at Los Angeles International Airport as 89 degrees.' I don't think you gentlemen will be needing these. - Mr. Radford? - Yeah, that's mine. - And Dr. Chapman. - Yes, thank you. [jazz music] [music continues] [music continues] Is the average American male more obsessed with sex? You see, that's another loaded question. Until we complete our survey and compile the results any answer to that question would be misleading. What motivates the American female to marry? She marries because of security, social acceptance, conformity children, companionship-- (female #1) 'Not love?' What happens if she's disappointed? In extreme cases, divorce, a lover an analyst, or a bottle. Do you expect to find marital infidelity more common in an upper income bracket community like Briarwood? No comment. Does a report on the subject of sex belong on the best seller list? I feel, my job is to gather facts not tell people what to think. You see-- We're running out of time, Doctor. Dr. Chapman's speaking at the Briarwood Women's Club in less than two hours. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. - Thank you. - Thank you, very much. Driver, will you wait a minute, please? - Hey, what's the big rush? - Debbie hasn't got her lunch. - Relax, she wont starve. - I'm sure I gave it to her. - Look, she found it. - 'Oh.' [engine revving] Frank, I might be a little late tonight. I'm gonna help out with the Nurse's Aide class. Did you hear what I just said? Perfectly. May be a little late tonight, the Nurse's Aide class. Looks like another tough day, Sarah. - Let's stay home tonight. - When don't we stay home? It's a nice house. I like it. What's wrong with that? Drive carefully. [engine starts] [instrumental music] (man on phone) 'Yes?' - Fred? - 'Alright, what is it?' - It's me. - 'Told you that.' Going to be a little late, but I'll be there. 'Alright.' [music continues] [car honking] Grace? (female #2) 'Hello, Kathleen.' Well, I called the airport. They're not coming. The lecture will start on schedule. Dr. Chapman's on his way, now. I missed you at the board meeting last night. Father and I were working on Boy's book. It's not right for you to be cooped up in that house. Boy's been dead for two years. I want you to get out more. Oh, Grace, Grace, Grace. I do go out. As a matter of fact, I have a dinner date tonight. - Ted Dyson. - Ted Dyson. Ted Dyson's an old friend of your husband's and that hardly counts. I want you to have a beau. A real beau. Honey, where's Dr. Chapman's lecture gonna be held? - The Women's Club. - Oh, silly, I know that. - But which room? - The Garden room. It's more intimate and we can see those two marvelous pieces of sculpture that you sold the club last month. I suppose we should've donated them but this is such a commercial world. - Ha-ha. - What? What-what did I say? I was just thinking of all the fascinating things I'm going to tell Dr. Chapman. You, my love, are going to be in a book. - Bye bye, darling. - Bye, honey. [pleasant music] [knocking on the door] (male #1) 'Water man.' Water man. [music continues] Shall I leave an extra bottle? You're new. Just till the regular fellow gets back. He's...down with the flu. What did he tell you about me, hmm? I never met him. Well, here's your money. [music continues] Take your money. I'll, uh, see if I have change. 'What's your name?' Bob, Bob Jensen. You live here alone? Yes, I live alone. [music continues] No, leave me alone. Go away. Go away. Please go away! [dog barking] Danny.. [whining] ...and I know that if years ago my wife had come to me and told me she was attending a lecture of this kind why, I'd have hit the ceiling. I probably would've told her to stick to washing and ironing. [all laughing] While your presence here indicates that your husbands are not as prudish.. ...fact remains that prudery, in general, is far from dead. In many sections of this country sex is a secret and shameful function. An unhealthy attitude persists. Too many women suffer from too little knowledge about a subject that occupies a major and crucial part of their lives. 'Why, as many as four or five out of every ten women' 'in this room...probably suffer from this lack of knowledge.' 'As a result, their happiness is seriously impaired.' The subject of sex remains under the table. Back-room, back-street, suppressed, unknown and always indecent. My associates and I believe that through our findings 'these women will come to understand' 'that sex is descent, clean and dignified.' Now to help us succeed in our task 'we must have your complete confidence' 'your trust, we need it' 'we ask for it.' 'And to this end I wanna assure you' 'that we are fact finders, no more, no less.' We are not in the business of upraising correcting or commenting. 'To many of you, the idea of discussing' 'intimate sexual details with a stranger' 'even though he is hidden from you by a screen' 'an embarrassing idea.' If I could use one word to, uh, describe our approach that word would be...detachment. 'In the final analysis' 'each of you will have been absorbed by the whole.' 'In no way could our published findings ever embarrass anyone.' 'Never could the results be traced to a single individual.' Well, I want you to imagine that your speaking not to a man but to an uncritical machine 'that has never heard a single sexual history' 'that it has not heard repeated time and time again.' I ask that you, uh, take home the brochures that you found on your seats 'study them.' 'If you have any questions, call my secretary, Miss Selby' 'here at the club.' When you are convinced of the importance of our project would you please fill out the enclosed card and mail it to me. Do not sign it. 'You'll be known only by the number' 'that you find in the upper right-hand corner.' To those of you who prefer not to volunteer.. ...we understand. To the rest, thanks. Marvelous! Marvelous! I find this entire lecture physically disgusting. [indistinct chattering] I'll give the board a list of the people who didn't show up. They're probably the bluenose, the sexually suspect. - Did I miss much? - No. He says that four out of five were suffering from lack of-- - You didn't take notes? - Knowledge. For Geoffrey. Oh, now, I'm off to the beach with my faithful little tape recorder I'm speaking my poems against the roar of the waves and the cry of the gulls. Against? You know, like that, that-that Greek by the sea. - Demosketes-- - Demosthenes. Didn't he fill his mouth with pebbles? Only because he stammered. And Geoffrey says it's good for my projection. - Mail in your card. - I'll do that right away. And don't forget the party, Tuesday week. And, Kathleen, don't you dare come stag. Well, I suppose I might as well face Dr. Chapman. I may be hours. - I'll drive you home. - Thanks. - You don't mind? - No. Eighty-two? Weren't we promised a full turn out? I think the doctor had figured around 150. - I see we made the front page. - Mmm. Along with Dr. Jonas. I'm Grace Waterton. Is Dr. Chapman available? Sorry, he had an appointment at the university. Ah, this is his assistant, Mr. Radford. He'll-- Oh, Mr. Radford, oh, he's the one. 'He's the one that's responsible for this wretched turn out.' 'He appeared in front of the board and prohibited it.' 'That was the very word he used, "prohibited".' You tell Dr. Chapman that Grace Waterton's not through fighting. I'll have his volunteers here by marching them up at gunpoint. Thank you, Mrs. Waterton. I'm sure Dr. Chapman will be pleased. I'm terribly sorry about this and I'll do my best. [door closes] That ain't so good. What's his game? You can correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm not aware that Dr. Chapman ever used the word love either in print or speech. I miss it. All your diagrams, graphs, tables are diverted to the physical act quantity, frequency, how much and how often. But that doesn't tell these women a damn thing about love.. ...or happiness. This is separating sex from affection, warmth tenderness, devotion. And I don't think that it should. How can you measure love? Why pretend that the physical act is a measurement of love? Dr. Chapman never said that. By not saying anything to the contrary, that's what he infers. People read your digits, make the comparisons and then...label themselves either normal or abnormal. You're just reading one side of the coin. Turn it over. Obversely, it reads exactly the opposite of what you been arguing. Show these women the factual statistics relating to their behavior, and it removes the shame and abnormality from them. I say this is helpful. It liberates millions from needless repressions and guilts. I'm not sure I like that kind of a gamble. Have you ever considered in terms of human suffering the cost of your surveys? These women come in to see you, sick or well. Most of them have everything in order properly in place, properly replaced and they function. Then you start hammering your questions, digging, prying. Each question of painful probe into areas properly forgotten. Then all order disappears. You start an uncontrolled chain of unwholesome, noxious forces. And you don't follow through, you don't stay with the subject help them put everything back in place again. You set off a chain reaction, then let them go. And I wonder.. ...go where? To what? 'What do they lack afterwards?' 'What becomes of them?' (male #2) 'Kath?' In here, father. Oh, your home early. - I think I'll go. - Good....where? Chapman interviews. - But you're feverish, you-- - Now, now, now.. Before you get angry. I think that you should read this-- I stopped reading that kind of literature when I got out of high school. It's not that kind of literature. It's explaining-- I don't care what it explains. Can you imagine what will happen to the reception of Boy's book when the public learn that you.. ...that you went to this thing? You mean the sale? I don't think the public gives a hoot whether I live or die. Now, that is where you're wrong. As Boy's widow, you hold a special position. I don't see how you can possibly consider discussing.. '...the certain matters about Boy and you' 'that belong properly only to yourselves.' [intense music] Please, Boy. (Boy) 'Go Back to bed, Kath. Get some sleep.' I'll see you in the morning. No, Boy, don't do this to me. I love you. Boy, I want you. Please, be patient and-and gentle. Wait, my lovely tall blonde, when I've been patient two years patient. Two long cold years! Oh, but I've tried, Boy. You know how hard I've tried. I must admit you tried. Look, Kath, you've gotta face the facts. Remember Jim, Korea, during the war? He was shacked up with a French nurse. - Femme de glace, he called her. - No, don't. Femme de glace, woman of ice. - That's you, woman of-- - No. Oh, Boy, we're not shacked up. We're married. We're in love. Oh, please, Boy, if there's, if there's something.. Help me! I-I don't wanna be half a woman. I-I-I don't feel cold, Boy. I want you, I need you. Oh, it's.. Boy, it's just that there's something.. ...that moment, oh.. ...when you, when you touch me-- That's what's known as being frigid. You, Kath, were born a frigid woman. There's nothing you can do about it. Oh, oh.. No, no, I'm not. Oh, I'm not. I'm not, I'm not. You're wrong, I'm not. [music continues] I'm a little tired, Father. Goodnight. 'Well, did you forget something?' Oh, Dad. Won't you come in? Please make yourself comfortable. Thank you. Good morning. I'm one of the interviewers for this research project. Are you quite comfortable? Why, yes, thank you. 'In our correspondence, you were assigned a number.' 'Do you have that card with you?' Oh, yes. 'Is the number 481-J?' Four eighty-one, yes. Now, let me see. You're 24-years of age. Marital status, widow. Born in Richmond, Virginia. Moved to San Francisco when 12-years-old. Educated, Roanoke College. And the Sorbonne. 'The Sorbonne, yes, I have that here.' 'Might we begin with questions about your adolescent years?' Yes, of course. 'Take as much time as you like' 'and if there's one that isn't clear, let me know.' Alright. 'During your teens did you go out with boys a great deal?' I think so, yes. 'In your relationship with them' 'were you at anytime physically intimate?' Never. We were friends except when they wanted to be more than friends. 'Did you engage in heavy petting?' - No. - 'Casual petting?' No. 'Kissing?' Occasionally. 'Then in your teens you generally resisted' 'the physical advances of young men?' Yes. 'Was this because of your sense of right and wrong?' 'Disinterest or fear of possible consequences?' Right and wrong. 'And this came from teachings at school?' 'In church?' 'Or at home?' All three. I think my father and I had a wonderful relationship. And...he was very understanding...and strict. He still is. Uh, understanding, I mean. 'I see your husband died two years ago.' You see, he was a test pilot. He held...four world records for speed in a jet. 'And your marriage lasted three years?' Yes. 'The next few questions are concerned ' 'with physical relationship.' 'First, frequency.' Um.. Let me think, uh.. You needn't be exact. Well, he was away a good deal. His work kept him away. Did you engage in preliminary love playing? We.. Yes, of course. 'How much time was devoted to this?' 'Generally.' [exhales] A long time. Can you be more specific? I, bu.. I.. What? [clattering] Oh. 'Is anything wrong?' Are you alright? Yes, I'm alright. I, I just dropped my bag. 'Did you enjoy the physical relationship' 'with your husband?' Not very much? Very much, not at all? Very much. Isn't that normal? I'm no different than anybody else. Why do you have to put so much emphasis on physical love? I-I mean why, why do you have to keep asking all these sickening details? Can't you just ask me about love? I'm trying. I can't! I can't! [dramatic music] Excuse me. You'll have to forgive me. I'm sorry. [door knob clicking] [door closes] [music continues] Oh. That young lady, Mr. Radford, number 481-J. Is there anything wrong? Well, she must have dropped this wallet. I'll put it in the afternoon mail. Could you glance at this? - Unusual? - Yeah. That article in the newspaper, yesterday, bothered me. Went out to see Dr. Jonas. And? He's intelligent. He has some good points. - She was a evasive. - She was also lying. It's incomplete. So I noticed. This isn't your first incomplete interview. It's the first after talking to Dr. Jonas. Setting off chain reactions? Don't let him throw you, Paul. We've a full time job ahead of us, as it is. Ready, Doctor? No, just give me a couple of minutes. Don't let him throw you, Paul. [dramatic music] (male announcer #1 on TV) 'And there he goes. Safe at second. Another..' Here's your pop-corn. Taste it. See if it's got enough salt. You used to like baseball. I still look at it once in a while. Perfect. (male announcer #1 on TV) 'Little shaken up over that stolen base.' 'Here's the wind up and the pitch.' 'And it's right down the middle. 'No runs, no hits, no errors Still a tie ball game.' - 'George?' - 'Right, Fred.' (male announcer #2) 'Now, you're gonna hear' 'a word from your friendly loan company.' - No, I'm not. - 'If you had--' How was it, today, at the hospital? Didn't you say somethin' about the Nurse's Aide class? Why do you ask me? You don't have to answer. I was only making conversation. Frank, excuse me. I'm jittery. I-I'm taking those diet pills. I want to lose four pounds. What are you trying to be? Miss America? To me, you're exactly right. Isn't that enough? [dramatic music] When the relationships between the characters become full and rich then we'll get to the heart of the play. 'And for a director' that's-that's a greater reward than the commercial theatre can ever offer. 'Thank you for a very good evening. Good night.' Mrs. Garnell, would you mind waiting a moment? I'd like to discuss about your last entrance in the last scene. I don't think you're taking a long enough pause, there. - I don't think-- - You should take a beat there. And-and have the courage to let them wonder because wonderment is the heart and soul of the theatre. We wonder-we wonder about tonight. We wonder about tomorrow. [dramatic music] Is scotch alright? I never drink at.. Thanks. [spectators cheering on TV] It's getting late. Shouldn't the children be home? When they're with Mrs. Tasker, I don't worry. Did you tell them not to stay for the second show? Got quite an argument. Those kids. Like their mother. 'Their idea of heaven is a theatre.' [dramatic music] Really, Mr. Linden. You won't have any trouble replacing me in the play. It-It's just I.. As a matter of fact, I don't have enough time. I.. You know, you have the loveliest mouth, I've ever seen. No, I.. [music continues] Frank. Frank, let's go away some place. - Of course-- - Palm springs or any place. Come on, we haven't been anywhere together for months. Sarah, you know me. I'd go anywhere. Who'd run the office this time of the year? Yeah. I know. - Good night, Frank. - Good night. [doorbell ringing] - Mrs. Barclay? - Yes. - Kathleen Barclay? - Yes, that's right. Oh, this must be yours. It was turned into our office. I'm Paul Radford. Dr. Chapman's assistant. - Oh, please. - Thank you. Not half as many credit cards as I have. You couldn't get along without it. You're very kind. It was found in one of the interview rooms. Yes...I-I dropped my bag. And the secretary found it under the chair. You were on the other side of that screen? You interviewed me. I realize it seems strange but-- You asked me those questions and then you come here.. Why did you come here? The simple truth is, I felt responsible for what happened this morning. I thought if you're still disturbed, perhaps I-- Yes, I'm disturbed. Can you blame me? I went through with that-that stupid interview.. 'I don't know why I did.' But, they told me it would be anonymous. And now, the first thing I know, the interviewer is in my house. 'And staring!' I'm sorry, Mrs. Barclay. My coming here was a mistake. Goodnight. Do you realize the kind of hell you've put me through? Do you? Don't look at me like that. Don't. I'm not one of your pathological cases. Boy and I had a wonderful life together. We.. [sobbing] Goodnight. [instrumental music] I'm not a pathological case. "I have forgot much, Cynara! gone with the wind "flung roses, roses riotously with the throng "yea, all the time, because the dance was long "I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! "In my fashion. [men shouting] "I cried for madder music and for stronger wine "but when the feast is finished and the lamps expire '"then falls thy shadow, Cynara!' [men yelling] "But when the feast is finished and the lamps expire "then falls thy shadow, Cynara! The night is thine. "Yea, hungry for the lips of my desire "I have been faithful to thee, Cynara. [indistinct shouting] "I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! In my fashion." - 'Hut! Hut!' - Alright! - 'Hut 2.' - 'Here we go.' 'Fall back, 70 across, on 2. Let's go. On 2.' - Oh come on! - Come on! The louts. And what with their profane shouting I had to repeat that third verse five times. What a lovely night. Darling, it's Thursday. Our night. [romantic music] Followed by Friday, your big day. You know, even when I-I just think about tomorrow's interview, I feel wicked. I think husbands should be allowed to share this experience. I think, Dr. Chapman should interview husbands with their wives. Darling. You just gave me an idea. (Dr. Chapman) 'At one point, you used the word "endurable"' 'in relationship to--' Oh, I'm sure that I meant pleasurable. 'Well, thank you. I'll make that correction.' May I ask a question? 'Well, of course.' I may be wrong.. ...but am I being interviewed by Dr. George Chapman? Why, yes. I am deeply moved, sir. My husband and I have read your two books. And we venerate your writing. I had to ask. If I'd gone to an analyst in Vienna at the turn of the century I would've wanted to have known if he was Sigmund Freud. Well, I'm very honored. Thank you. Now, to return to a series of question on pre-marital-- 'Well, after we were engaged' 'our marriage was delayed a year.' (Teresa on tape) 'Due to family circumstances' 'his mother took all of Geoffrey's money and time.' 'But of course...we were adult about our relationship.' (Dr. Chapman on tape) 'And by "adult", you mean?' (Teresa on tape) 'Until we were married' 'we refrained from sexual union.' Marvelous. Your voice is marvelous. You know-- (Teresa on tape) 'We adhered to accepted moral standard.' (Dr. Chapman on tape) 'Regarding your marital intimacy' 'comparing the present with the your first year' 'has there been any noticeable change in the regularity' 'of the physical relationships?' Would you lower the treble just a little, darling?. (Teresa on tape) 'It has remained...constant.' 'Orderly, civilized and constant.' (Dr. Chapman on tape) 'As to the time of day?' (Teresa on tape) 'Oh, not during the day.' (Dr. Chapman on tape) 'Have you ever wished or dreamed' 'that your husband were another man?' (Teresa on tape) 'I've never had such wishes or dreams, Doctor.' - I meant that, darling. - Shh. (Dr. Chapman on tape) 'Thank you. That'll be all.' 'We appreciate the time you've given us.' (Teresa on tape) 'But, Doctor, we're not through already?' Geoffrey, are we abnormal? We must put that voice on the stereo. I'll have the art department get right on the album cover. "Readings at Random", by Teresa Harnish. Geoffrey, are you listening? I asked you, are we abnormal? We have abnormally good taste. We're abnormally happy. I think Dr. Chapman was bored. Well, why on earth should he be bored? No no, he sounded very interested. You weren't listening. The interview was so short. And when he asked me for details I had none to give him. It was...no. No. Seldom. Never. It's obvious. He found us just plain dull. Are we doing it for his enjoyment or ours? I thought our marriage was a perfect blending of beauty and passion. Oh, it is. It is, darling. Where's Dr. Chapman's first book? (Tape recording) - 'May I ask a question?' - 'Of course.' We'll compare. (Teresa on tape) 'I may be wrong, but am I being interviewed' 'by Dr. George Chapman?' One ninety-eight. (Dr. George Chapman on tape) 'Why, yes.' (Teresa on tape) 'I'm deeply moved, sir.' 'My husband and I have read your two books' 'and we venerate your writing.' 'I had to ask.' 'If I'd gone to an analyst in Vienna' 'at the turn of the century' 'I would've wanted to have known if it was Sigmund Freud.' (Dr. Chapman on tape) 'Well, I'm very honored. Thank you.' Geoffrey...I think we're missing something. (Dr. Chapman on recorder) 'Now to return to a series of questions on pre-marital--' How long have you been married? Twelve years. 'How would you describe your marriage?' Very gratifying? Satisfactory? Unsatisfactory? Intolerable? I don't know how to answer that. I have two beautiful children. 'What we wanna know about' 'is your relationship with your husband?' He's a very fine person. He.. 'Your physical relationship.' Oh. 'Very gratifying? Satisfactory?' 'Unsatisfactory? Intolerable?' Well, you might classify it as.. ...tolerable. - 'What about the frequency?' - Once a week. 'Exactly?' Saturday comes once a week, exactly. Before your marriage, were there other men? I had boys who.. If you mean, um, anything...serious, no. 'Now we have a series of questions' 'about extra-marital relationships.' 'Have you been in such relationship with any man' 'or men, other than your husband?' Yes. 'One man or more?' One man. 'When did it happen?' Now. 'And how long has it lasted?' Uh, three months. 'How often do you meet this man?' Uh, two...or three times a week. Whenever it's possible. 'Is your partner, in this relationship' 'single or married?' He's married, but he's separated. His wife won't give him a divorce. 'Now, another question.' 'To the best of your knowledge' 'would you say your husband knows about this relationship?' 'You might reply, "he knows because he was told"' '"He knows because he found out"' '"He probably suspects"' '"He does not know".' 'Which would you say?' He does not know. 'How do you expect it to end?' End? 'Do you plan to leave your husband?' No. 'Do you plan to stop seeing the other man?' - No. - 'No, which?' I don't plan either of...these things. 'You expect things to continue as they are, then?' I haven't thought about.. Yes, I suppose so. 'For how long?' How long? [dramatic music] [music continues] Sarah. What the devil are you doing here? Uh, I had to see you, Fred. I-I got through early. I wanted to see you. Who-who is that woman? You mean, you met her? Certainly, I met her. Why? Shouldn't I have? Oh, don't be silly. It's not that. It doesn't matter. Just that I beg you to telephone, first. Why? Who is she? My wife. Oh. Uh, does she do this often? Do what? There's nothing. I've told you, there's nothing between us. We just have some community property, that's all. Now, let me have my kiss, huh? Why did she come here? She comes here once or twice a month and we sign some papers. - You always give her a drink? - She was thirsty. For what? Sarah. I'm sorry. I.. I.. Fred, don't be angry at me. Please, don't be angry at me. I'm not angry. I only wish you try not to do this again. I have nothing to hide. But sometimes, it-it's awkward. I-I won't do it again, never. I just had to see you today. You want a drink? Fred. [laughs] You know Madame Bovary? I don't know her personally. Come on, I mean the book. Of course, I know the book. Don't say of course. Not everybody knows. Frank.. You know, I learnt some of the lines, by heart. Uh, they kind of describe exactly how I was before I met.. Would you like to hear me recite? Alright. Um...uh.. "Her innermost heart "Was waiting for something to happen to her. "She turned to despairing gaze "over the solitude of her life. "Searching for some white sail "in the dark mist of the horizon. "Nothing happened to her. "The future was a dark corridor "the door at the end, shut fast. "White sail.. "...on the far mist of the hori.." Oh, Fred. I'm so glad you did happen to me. Tell me, you love me, huh. Of course, I love you. Let's not ever spoil it by being rash. I want this to go on forever. But the main thing we must both remember.. ...we must be sensible. Why? - 'Hello?' - Dr. Chapman's office? - 'Mmm-hmm.' - Mr. Radford, please. [indistinct voice on phone] How long will that be? [indistinct voice on phone] I'd like to leave a message for him, please. Well, Joe.. ...I may as well. Later. [soft music] - Good afternoon. - Hello. I was positive that you wouldn't turn up. Wouldn't have blamed you, if you hadn't. [sighs] Oh, it's hell to apologize. Then don't. I shouldn't have come to your house. I should've had Miss Selby call you. You would've come, picked up the wallet and that was it. I should be doing the apologizing. - What will you have? - Uh, vodka martini. Two vodka martinis, Joe. You've been in this type of work long? No, just a few years. I used to be a teacher and a writer, of sorts. Oh, what made you give it up? [laughs] I'm tempted to say, an interest in women and money. Well, actually, I suppose I was flattered by the offer to...work under Dr. Chapman. To be on the inside of...something so important. I suppose, there's some secret place I still think of myself as a writer. There's no such thing as an ex-writer. I like to believe that.. ...one day, all this will be useful. The Dr. Chapman's lecture was impressive. He's a remarkable man. He's solid, single-minded, dedicated. Good to be with a man like that, when everything around you seems uncertain, unsolved, flying off in every direction. He's been a fine example. I'm surprised you need one. You seem so...sure of yourself. Oh, I mean that in a nice way. It's a facade. I'm like everyone else. Inside there are too many corridors and turnings and.. ...we all get lost sometimes. I've been talking too much. It's only fair, you've had the advantage of learning.. ...at the interview. That was business. And this? This isn't business. You mean to tell me, you don't enjoy all that.. ...talk with assorted women? It's meaningless after a while. There's an inevitable sadness about everyone. Oh, does that include me? And me. [laughs] - Pleasant thought? - Not really. I was childish the other night. I've apologized. It was easy. Oh! Another? Do you have any plans for dinner? Oh, I promised Father.. No, not really. Good. [doorbell rings] Well, you're selling something or what? I live down the block. Well? And my name is Wash Dillon. Maybe, you've heard my band. We've got some records. Yes. Mrs. Shields? Ms. Shields. Now, how could that be? Well, anyway. It says "Mrs." here. - What's that? - Your mail. Mailman must have hung one on, he left it in my box by mistake. So I came over with it neighborly like. - Anything important? - No, it's a bill. I, uh, don't know how to thank you. I know how. You might give a good neighbor a good cup of coffee for the road. It's a long block. Couple of cups left. Drink and get out, though. I've a business appointment. You lived here long? Mmm-hmm. Three years. 'Your...wife like Briarwood?' No, there's no wife, not yet. Bachelorhood is the best thing for a musician. How about your husband? We divorced three years ago. You know, honey, I just had a hunch that was so. How is your band? Obvious combo. - Oh, where do you play? - 'On the strip.' 'Place called Jorrocks' Jollities.' How often do you perform? Every night, honey. [sensual music] Need to say, honey. I just had a hunch, you're divorced. Did you? You can always tell when there's been no man around. You can? 'It's the way a woman moves.' Unsettled. One of your girls teach you that? [Wash laughs] 'Sharp!' No, honey.. ...my women don't move like that. My women don't move at all. Pretty cocky, aren't you? Alright to be. Never had a complain. [intense music] I don't like this kind of talk! I don't like it! [sobbing] Oh, Wash, don't. You're hurting.. Oh, no. I don't want to. I don't want to. I don't. Oh. No! [moans] [doorbell rings] Honey, wait now. Oh, there's someone at the door. - Let him be. - Oh. [doorbell rings] [doorbell rings] (boy #1) 'My father came here.' 'Pop! Ma says to come home.' I'll be along. Now, beat it! She says, I ain't to come home without you or she'll come and get you herself. Well, it's the way the cookie crumbles. - Alright, Johnny. - You.. You look awful hungry, honey. Come on over to Jorrock's sometime. [jazz music] [indistinct chatter] [music continues] [music continues] [indistinct chatter] [music continues] [people applauding] That's a beer you owe me, Dad. She'll be back. "Last night, ah, yesternight "betwixt her lips and mine "there fell a shadow [men chattering] "Cynara! "Thy breath was shed all night upon mine heart I felt her warm heart beat" [men yelling] Oh! [man laughing] Oh, ho. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, lady. Jackie, there, has got a lot of speed 'but he hasn't got much control.' Here...we won't let it happen again. Oh, that's alright. I wasn't scared. Well, we'll watch it next time. Now, don't you worry. I don't mind. It is, it's fun watching. What game is it? Football, touch football. We play it to keep in shape. Don't take any wood nickels, lady. Do you.. Are you a real player? Pro-ball, lady. Well, I only played second string last year. But you watch my smoke this year. I'd like to. - But what name do I-- - Ed, Ed Krowski. Write it. Keep fast, hog breath! Stay loose, lady. (male #3) 'Pass it here.' [indistinct yelling] Come on. Come on. Come on! Think fast! "Yea, all the time.." - 'Here we go. '- 'Come on. Let's go.' Wh-what a magnificent animal. "All the time because" Oh, magnificent! Well, look at him, he's showing off his muscles. [indistinct yelling] "All the time because the dance was long" Look at those long legs. I wonder what sort of girl goes out with him. "I have been faithful to thee" I expect one of those common girls you see riding on the surfboards. "In my fashion I have been faithful to thee" You know, he could be quite attractive. - Alright, here we go. - Let's pull up. He's the kind of man...who needs.. ...who needs a woman.. ...to help him. A woman who's... better than he is. A woman with taste. A woman who's aware of the beauty. Not me, but.. ...somebody like me. [tape erasing] Spatial sensation. Isn't this just great? How do you like this? Well, it's little on the orange side. Have you made up a guest list for the party, yet? Well, I thought we'll do it together tonight. You like this? This is perfect. Darling. [saxophone music] Have you ever thought of-of joining one of those health clubs? You know, build up the body. Build up the body? Geoffrey. Our lives should be richer. We should enjoy our gifts fully. After all.. ...these are the best years of our lives. Do you like this? I've arranged for your recording date. Have you been rehearsing? Entire morning. I believe I've, uh, found what was lacking. Can I hear the tape? I, uh, erased it. I wasn't satisfied. You're showing more enthusiasm for this project than the summer you spent dwarfing trees. But this gives me the opportunity to express myself. To give myself to a primitive force which will give added depth and, and-and breadth.. ...of the spirit. [upbeat music] Hey, hey, let's do the signals, one, two. Oh, mister. - 'One, two.' - Oh, mister. Look, lady, you're fouling up the signals. I'm sorry. I was, I was hoping to see your friend. A beautiful young man. Beautiful? He's usually with you, I can't remember his name. He's the Ed. Ed? Ed Kraski. He's working at the amusement park. Would you give him a message for me? Will you say that the lady on the beach will be down to see him tomorrow morning? The lady on the beach? He'll know who I mean. I'll see he get's the message, lady. Thanks. Thanks very much. Fellows. Oh! - Out? - 'In.' Right, right on the line. 'Phew!' Congratulations. You gave me quite a run for my money. Don't you think it'd be more sensible to play doubles? Nonsense. I'll take up doubles when they put me out to pasture. Oh, he's here. Please don't say anything about Dr. Chapman or the interviews. That's your business, Kathy. I've never told you who you should see but this investigator.. - He's not an investigator. - Well, whatever he is. Haven't you seen him enough and now meeting him here. Not louder. He'll hear you. Hello, Paul. I'd like you to meet my father, Paul Radford. Sorry, I missed the game. Who won? - Father, but one of these-- - I'm going to shower. - Will I see you at the club? - No, not today. Um, Paul's giving me a lesson in bowling. I'll see you at home then. Bye, Mr. Radford. Oh, he still cant bear to see me with.. He and Boy were like father and son. They enjoyed each other. Boy used to let him win in the last sets. And you? Oh, no, I'm a.. He's a much better player than I am. Last year, I think, I only won one or two games. Oh, he's so marvelous since Boy.. You know, he has given up most of his activities. We are due in ten minutes. I'll run up and shower. Thank you. Meet you in the car? [indistinct chatter] What a morning. No hello? No how are you, Sarah? Oh, you promised to phone me, remember? Charlie, vodka and tonic. I phoned you so often the last couple of days my finger's numb. Oh, I'm sorry, baby. But I was on the trail of something good. Oh, no, no, not that, the job. But it turned out to be just another TV part so I told them that I was not interested at any price. And now, I'm all yours again. - All mine. - Mm-hmm. From 11 in the morning till, uh, 5:00 in the afternoon. Three days a week, some weeks. And then only if I phone first, right? Sarah, what's got into you? I thought we had worked out a very sensible arrangement. This is no place to talk about those things. This place and your boat, that's our world. Our oh so sensible world. Fred, what if we stop being so sensible? What if you ask your wife for a divorce? What if I leave Frank? Look, Sarah, let me get out of this soup before you hit me over the head with all that serious talk. Let's go to the boat, huh? I have to go back. I love you so much. I'll, uh, I'll phone you first thing in the morning, huh? Frank. - Frank. - Hmm. Oh. Who won again? Always the game. Let's have one of our talks the way we used to. Come here, sit down. You know, the fact is I've been wanting to talk to you. There's nothing wrong. Frank. What would you do if, uh.. What if something happened to me? Ah, come on, our talks were never that serious. Well, it is serious, what if it did? How would you take care of the children? I don't know, I'd get someone to stay with us. But what brought this up? Would you get your sister Mildred? Mildred it is. Sarah, please. I don't wanna think of you ever leaving. Frank, uh.. - Um, goodnight. - Sleep tight. [indistinct chatter] You can buy me that beer anytime. Yeah, lots of luck. As we soon I get out of this, we're going home. This is my home away from home. The boys and I use it for recreation. Come on in, honey. You polish your stuff? No, they throw in a maid service. She's not bad either. [intense music] [indistinct chatter] Wash, can you call me a cab? [chatter continues] [indistinct chatter] Will you call me a cab? [chatter continues] Have a seat, baby, maybe you can bring me-- Wash, will you.. Hey, you don't wanna fool around with my girl. Well, I'm sorry, Wash, I didn't know. - Sorry - Aah! What about me, baby? - Let go of me. - Anything you say. ...gentleman aren't gentleman, as for me.. [intense music] [screaming] [music continues] (male #4) 'Here we go.' [screaming] [tires screeching] (Wash) 'Alright, honey, this is it. Just let yourself out of here.' 'Come on. Come on, honey.' [tires screeching] Naomi? Naomi. [sobbing] Naomi. Come on, dear. Shh. It's alright. It's alright, it's me, it's Kathleen. Come on. It's alright, it's alright, it's alright. It's alright. Here, let me help you. It's alright, shh. It's alright, baby. It's Kathleen. No, don't. Leave me alone. I want to bathe. Please run me some hot water. Scalding hot. That's the last thing you need. What the hell do you know about what I need. Listen, you're in no condition to get tough with me. - Now, take that off-- - To hell with you. Don't you look at me like that, it wouldn't hurt you to have.. Oh! What is it? Shall I call a doctor? No. What do I have to do to get you out of here? Just leave me. - Will you call me if you need-- - Yes, damn it, yes. - Kath. - Yes. Feed the dog. [instrumental music] [music continues] Hello. Oh, hi, I didn't recognize you at first. Can we go somewhere and talk? He doesn't like us to leave the platform. What a cute little bubble? (male #5) 'Hey, where do you think you're going?' - May I call you Ed? - Everybody else does. You wanted to talk? I've been watching you on the beach and...you're so agile. - Your body is so-- - Well, I keep in shape. That brings me to why I wanted to see you. I'm an artist, quite a good one. And from the moment I first saw you I said to myself I must capture that on canvas. - Capture? - Paint. Paint? Me? You mean oil paintings? Dozens of 'em. I hope you will consent. Well, I don't know, what-what are they for? For? Oh, myself, exhibitions uh, probably reproduced in magazines or books. They take much time? An hour or two a day, no more. I don't know, I haven't got much time with this and practice. Well, a man has to relax a little. I think you'd find it relaxing. That's not what I mean Well, what do you call relaxing? Few beers with the boys, movie and well, some fun. - You mean girls? - Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Ed, you'd be surprised what good sport this can be. Well, I don't know. Of course, I wouldn't expect you to model for nothing. I saw your friend yesterday and I told him that I want.. Oh, perhaps I didn't. I'll pay you $20 for each session. Um, for each session that you pose. - For a couple of hours? - That's right. Well, lady, you got yourself a deal. When should we have our first meeting? Name it. Tomorrow morning at 11? Oh, I'm not free until 5. Five, not until five? Well, five's fine. You just write your address there. Tomorrow at 5. [car honks and car door shuts] - Miss Barclay? - Yes. - Kathleen Barclay? - Yes, where's my wallet? With the number of credit cards you carry I just couldn't resist the temptation. You, idiot. How did things go today? Ten interviews, all say no women. Oh, what a dreary life you lead. I had a tough afternoon proofreading Boy's book. Is it, is it always this way? I mean, I, I want to re-write everything. Always. I take it you're not pleased. I have no way of judging. I'd like you to read it. As a writer. I'd be glad to as a writer. On the other hand, I I don't think I wanna read about you and another man. Oh, Paul, that's not what it's about. It's his life. I don't, I don't play a very important part in it. I never did play a very important part in his life. I mean, his, his public life. I appear briefly as the conventional happy bride. You look like the happy bride. As he'd just been awarded a citation. You're so young. Yes, I was young in many ways. What was he like? You see, I do wanna know about him and you. Then, you'll just have to read the book. I'm, uh, I wanna be sure of at least one sale. What do you want to know? Why do you want to know? We were married, we were happy.. Must we talk about it? Of course not. Oh, Paul, I-I want to tell you. Only it's-it's-it's hard. When you're used to telling a story in-in-in a certain way oh, it's so hard to tell that same story. That-that un-untruth. I know. To somebody you care for. Kath. - Hello. Would you like a drink? - Hello. Thank you. We've been, we've been talking about the proofs. What do you think? Kathy tells me you were once an author. It stands a good chance of being a bestseller, war stories-- No, it's a story of a dedicated man, a hero. And a wonderful husband. I'm off to the club. This has to be back to the publisher by this week. Bye, Mr. Radford. Not too late tonight. I'm still his little girl. And still Boy's wife. What about your early teens? Teens? I engaged in lovemaking during my early teens. 'And from then until your marriage?' Many. This was from your early teens, until your marriage? No, mostly after I was 21. I like your voice. How old are you? 'In these affairs, did you accept favors?' - What does that mean? - 'Well, cash, gifts.' Oh, you certainly don't think that I'm-- - 'No, of course not.' - Nothing. Get this straight, nobody and I mean nobody ever touched me unless I wanted them to. I did it for love, I did it because I wanted to. 'Please don't misunderstand.' Well, see that you don't misunderstand. Were the affairs satisfactory? Question so ridiculous, I'm not gonna answer it. Fill that one in for yourself. 'And you were married only once?' This screen is a nuisance. I like to face the man I'm talking to. You asked.. Oh, yes, I was married only once. Time for a drink. - Would you like coffee, tea? - Gin. I'm afraid that's in Dr. Chapman's positively no list. It's in code. What did you answer? That you didn't reply to the question and that in my opinion the affairs were not satisfactory. You're a fool. With your experience in this kind of work can you tell by just looking at me? Can you tell what a woman's like by just looking at her? I don't think so. I mean about what you call, I suppose, her appetite? No. Well, look at me, it must show. A man, a musician, came to the door the other day, he looked. He knew. During your marital years-- - Often. - Often what? Often, I cheated on my husband. I know I shouldn't have done, but I did. He was kind. He was honest. He was loving. I really wanted him, but I wanted everyone else too. - You understand? - 'I think so.' The poor man just couldn't.. Anyway, I wasn't very happy. Maybe, I'll never will be. I don't know. You, uh.. You were right just now. Don't go giving me any cheap advice about seeing a psychiatrist, I've had that bit. The thing I learned was analysis is no substitute for guts. You're not a woman. You don't know what it's like to need love. And not to have it. At least not to have what you need. I-I didn't hear that. Nothing. We were talking about my married life. I was discreet. I'd go downtown and I'd pick up someone in a bar or in a movie. First it was once or twice a month, didn't know their names. I couldn't risk getting involved. Then, it started to get worse. Soon I had nothing else on my mind. I thought I'd go insane. And someone, a...friend saw me in another town with a man and scared me witless. And then I was away such a lot, my husband became suspicious. No, that's not true. He trusted me. He became.. [chuckles] He became curious. So I determined to stop going out for a while. But I couldn't. I just couldn't sit home and wait for him Just sit there and wait for him. I thought I'd go out of my mind. I really began to go insane. I was desperate. Then.. ...there was a neighborhood kid, not a kid exactly. He was about 20. But I.. I knew whenever I ran into him, I could he was mad about me. He was always looking at me. One night, I knew my husband would be working, I.. I went out and I found the boy and invited him for the evening. 'Then..' ...then someone switched on the lights. It was my husband. The kid just got up and ran and there I was. I wanted him to beat me. I wanted him to kill me. I told him about the others, not all, just some. You know what he did? He cried, poor thing. He just stood there and he cried. It was the worst part of it. He cried. I was determined I was going to kill myself. Took a couple of days of drinking to work up the nerve. I drove at top speed through busy intersections, red lights and all I got was a ticket. 'Sorry, I-I--' I said I tried, but I couldn't even kill myself. Years later.. Last night, I.. ...I tried again I wanted to crawl back to that musician.. ...to his friends, I.. I thought if I took enough pills, I would.. Ha! I took enough. The whole box. Too many, I threw them up. I was sick whole night. That's why I was late. I'm sorry. [intense jazz music] [music continues] Now, everything's gotta be finished by 7 o'clock. The guests are invited for 7:30 and with any luck they won't be here before 7:45. Now, George fixes the drinks, the Danish ham.. It's in the oven. 4:30. 4:30? Be a dear and put my art things in the back of the car. Oh, and Mrs. Simmons, would you please tell my husband that I'll be back in about an hour and a half. An hour and three quarters. The flowers. I want them right here, just off center. [dramatic music] [music continues] Hey, there she is. * Whoa la de de do do * [whistling] [guitar music] (Ed singing) * One night she passed through close by my bed * * When I was fast.. * Come in. * She put her arms around my neck * * And then began to weep * Hi, getting a little practice. * She wept she cried she pulled her hair * * Me, what could I do * * So all along I held her in my arms * * To keep her from that pokie pokie dude * It's one of the favorites down at the coffeehouse. Say, how about a beer? It'll set you up. Only if you will have one with me. Well, I've had three, but I'm not one to say no. * The only only thing that I did that was wrong * * Was keep her from.. * Well, not bad, huh? Here. Here's to a lot of famous pictures. - And here's to art and life. - Right. Sit down, sit down and take a load off of your feet. Here. Jackie and I put a board under it. You like a hard bed? That's what finished the Romans you know? - Hard beds? - Soft beds and hot baths. Yeah, well I take cold showers. Might we get started. Uh, is your roommate up to.. - Will he be home soon? - No, I kicked him out. I'm not gonna let him sit around and heckle me while I'm being painted. I'm so glad because ever since the first day I saw you at the beach in your natural element I observed the grace of your body and the freedom of your limbs I've wanted to sketch you as a Greek Olympic hero. Have you ever seen that classical statue of the discus thrower? No. Well, inspired by your body I feel that I can surpass Myron the Greek. Assume the possession. Huh? Oh, like this. That's right. You know, the discus throwers were in the nude. I like all the Greek Olympians and that is how I'd like you to pose. - With nothing on? - In the classical tradition. Now, if you'd get disrobed, I'll be getting ready. Now, wait a minute, lady. You don't expect me to take off my clothes in front of a woman. Why, you don't settle for false modesty. After all this is for art. Art. In your profession, I suppose you must take care of your body. Like a baby, but a man has to have one vice. Is that your only vice? Now, it depends on what you call vice. Well, female companionship? Oh, no, not while I'm in training. Besides, if you saw some of those flipper hoes that got washed up on the beach. Well, Ed, you are modest. Yes. [trumpet blowing] Think of me as something that's washed up on the beach. Think of me as-as-as one of your flipper hoes. What did you say? You think that I'm too much of a lady to be one of your.. Well, I'm a lady, but I'm also a woman. Are you gonna paint me? Of course, not silly. I can do that next time. I want.. You know.. First time I saw you, I fought the feeling inside of me. I knew that I was enamored of you. Foolishly so. But women in love are foolish. And now I just want your love. Do you want to kiss me, Ed? Kiss me, Eddie. You might enjoy it. Well, pick my teeth. Jackie said! - He said what, Ed? - Well, he had a hunch. Yes. He said, "Boy, there's a lot of pepper in that tomato." And you like pepper, Ed? I do. - Are you ready? - Oh, so ready. I, I can't breathe, Ed. Oh, relax, Ed. Boy, that Jackie, he can heckle off my way. Just listen to me, Ed, stop it. I, I do find you desirable. It, it's just that.. things like this should be done.. Things like this should take time. You can't just toss me about like a football. I, I admire your, your strength and the.. Ed. Ouch! Really you must listen to reason. Things like this could be beautiful. No, Ed. Stop it! 'For heaven's sake!' (Ed) 'Hey, your alright, kid?' You can paint me anytime of the week. Hey, I don't even know your name. [laughing] [dramatic music] [tires screeching] (Geoffrey) 'What if we move this slightly to the left' 'to balance the table better?' 'That's not good.' 'It hides the lobster and we should think of color.' 'Color and food is important to the appetite.' Wouldn't you say? I'm absolutely lost without her. Here. Oh, no, no, no. I said just off center. You're early. Yes, I-I finished a little earlier. Darling. Let me look at you. Oh, you look marvelous. So, so slim. Give me a kiss. Do I smell beer? Well, it was, it was rather hot. Mable, will you run my bath for me, please? Don't you think we should have the silver platters? - Oh, darling. - Yes. You're wonderful. We haven't missed a thing. No, I don't think so. We've the ham, we've the flowers. We can, we can live our life to the fullest. Just the two of us. Now, I'm going to change. Will you see to the hors d'oeuvres? Certainly, darling. Now, I'll tell you what.. Wash away my trouble. Wash. Wash. Wash. Wash. Wash. Wash. Wash in a tub. Rub a dub dub. Three men in a tub. [intense jazz music] (woman on phone) 'Operator.' I want Wash. '...wrong number..' Oh. I want the number. It's a night club. Well, it's like in happy.. J-Jollity, Jorrocks' Jollity. Jollity. It's on Sunset. [music continues] (man speaking indistinctly) It is? It's a joke. You say Jollity, I say...well, same to you. I want to talk to Wash. On the bandstand. Wash. [Wash speaking indistinctly] Hello, Wash? I left my bag there the other night. That's right. Why should I be mad? How are the boys? Alright. I'll leave the door open. [intense continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [indistinct chatter] - Would you care for some crab? - Yes. Thank you. - May I help you, sir? - No, thanks.. Hello, Dorothy, how are you? Paul, can you imagine the sensation if they knew you were one of the interviewers? I couldn't recognize one voice from the next what goes out in one ear goes out the other. You're probably just saying that to protect your clients. We have the most exciting plan. To raise the money we're going to put on a play this summer. Everybody must try out for it and that means both of you. Oh, marvelous, but only if we can play the lovers. We'd thought of putting on one of those avant-garde plays. You know, Sartre, Ionesco. You will be marvelous in one of these things, Sarah. I had hoped to get Fred. You know, Fred Linden. 'I thought he'd jump at the chance.' 'It seems that his wife wanted to break up a certain affair' 'so she arranged a TV directing deal for him in Mexico City.' 'So he's leaving tomorrow.' You just have to get a list of all the available directors. You have no idea the problems one runs into trying to organize one of these things. If you could call me tomorrow and give me that list.. Hello, this is Sarah. Look, I'm tied up right now. Fred, you listen to me. Are you leaving for Mexico tomorrow morning? 'Who told you that?' I'm in a party, Fred, I just overheard it. I want you to tell me if it's true. I wanna know, you say it. I wanna hear this from you. I was gonna write you a note after the meeting tonight.. Oh, you were gonna write me a note? You are pulling my life out from under me. I'll be back in six weeks and we'll be together as before. Six weeks? I can't live without you for six weeks, darling, I'll die. I'll be back. You'll be back and then what? More trips? Fred, we can't live like this anymore. We can't. I'll come with you. No, I've, I-I've made up my mind. Nothing could change it. I-I'll come back. I'll come down to the boat tonight. '...not making any sense.' I am making sense for the first time in my life. 'You've family. What's got into you?..' You're my family now. Fred, you can keep me from coming. You tell me that you don't love me. Tell me you don't want me. Go on, tell me you, you never want me again. I-I can't say that, Sarah. See, it's settled. I'm going to go with.. I have to hang up now. Your choice of weapons. Thank you. Would you tell Frank.. I, uh, I want to go check up on the children. [indistinct chatter] [slow orchestral music] (Teresa on gramophone) 'I have forgot much, Cynara, gone with the wind.' 'Flung roses, roses riotously with the throng.' 'Dancing, to put the pale, lost lilies out of my mind.' 'But I was desolate and sick of an old passion.' 'Yeah, all the time, because the dance was long.' 'I have been faithful to thee, Cynara, in my fashion.' - Oh, darling-- - Shh!. 'I cried for madder music and for stronger wine.' 'But when the feast is finished and the lamps expire.' 'Then falls thy shadow, Cynara, the night is thine.' 'And I am desolate and sick of an old passion.' 'Yeah, hungry for the lips of my desire.' I have been faithful to thee. '...Cynara, in my fashion.' [guests applauding] (female #3) 'Bravo!' [indistinct chatter] [intense music] Fred, I've got my suitcase out in the car. I'm Ruth Linden. Mrs. Linden. - Where's Fred? - Oh, he's around, hiding. Hiding while I do his dirty work. He has always run from responsibility. You started closing in asking him to get a divorce. Well, that's where I come in. In fact, it's the only time I'm useful. Except for the money. "You've gotta help me, Ruth." "You've gotta get me out of this, Ruth baby." Ruth baby always does. - He doesn't love you. - You're right. It doesn't matter. He doesn't love you either. And that does matter. I've left my husband, we're going away together. Haven't I got through to you yet? It's over. Fred left me here to tell you. It's all over. - I don't believe you. - Oh, yes, you do. Just be honest with yourself. Why do you-- Pick him up when he falls down? Take a good look. You're looking at a woman without pride. 'I know that in the end he always comes back to me.' 'So in the end I'm there waiting.' Go home, Mrs. Garnell. I know where he is, I.. ...I won't give him up. Don't. Not for my sake. For yours. I know where he is. [jazz music] [music continues] Hey, Fred, somebody is looking for you. - 'I'll give you one of mine.' - 'Boy, you've got a deal..' [indistinct chatter] [car approaching] [car door slams] - It's late. - Yeah. It's going to rain, I heard it on the radio. Uh...are those the lumber contracts? Cement. Maybe I should close the windows, you know the rain. If you want to, it isn't necessary. You read it, didn't you? The note? Yeah, I read it. Why didn't you say something? I didn't know what to say. To tell the truth, I still don't know. When you love someone for 12 years what the hell can you say? I read it. I re-read it. I know that things were different lately but this I, I hadn't figured. I thought I knew you. I thought that I knew myself. Why did you come back, Sarah? I couldn't think of anyplace else to go tonight. I'll leave in the morning. You want to know what happened? No. I-I think you should. For your own sake. I-I'm not trying to defend myself. Twelve years...twelve years. I don't understand what.. Not that it matters, Frank. But it's all over now. I just thought I would tell you. Over? How the hell could that be over? As long as either of us can remember it won't be over! Well, all I'm asking you. Don't turn the kids against me, please. Um, tell them any story you want to tomorrow. Just as long as I can see them now and then, huh? My mouth is dry. You want to drink water? No, no, thank you. I'll go now. Uh, I'll send you the car back tomorrow. Sarah. When I said for better or worse.. ...I meant it. It isn't going to be easy. We'll have to work something out. Now, go to sleep. [soft music] [Sarah sobbing] [music continues] If only I'd stayed with her. I...I shouldn't have left her alone. Why? Why? Oh, there are so many reasons. She had no one. She was-- Lots of people have no one. That's no reason to kill yourself. I keep remembering things she said. There's no substitute for guts. She really wanted to escape. All alone. Paul. I.. ...I don't want to be alone. You had a near miss. Hello, Dr. Jonas. Near miss? I'm lecturing just down the hallway. That Shields girl, Naomi Shields. They found a Chapman interview card at her home. I interviewed her. I wanted to go before the board, have them stop this business. With that band leader's statement in that police report I have no proof. I'm late, very late. Your interview was a contributing factor. 'Oh, doctor. Dr. Jonas.' I'm sure you know that the books on Naomi Shields were closed a long time ago. That girl was doomed. It was only a matter of time. But there's someone else I'm very concerned about. - Oh, who's that? - Her name's Kathleen Barclay. Don't tell me Kathy has allowed herself to become one of your statistics. - You know her? - I've known her from her birth. She's a sensible girl. I can't believe that she'd subject-- - She did. That's how we met. - I see. Now, the scalpel has cut too deep. You're afraid she has become a victim of the chain reaction. Goes deeper than that. Why do you single her out for your concern? She's the first case history I have ever allowed to become more than a statistic. I love her. I love her very much. Oh, I see. Kathy is a fine girl, but she had the misfortune of going from a domineering father to a husband who was, to put it plainly, crude. But what is more important for a girl with her emotional problems the findings of your report might make her feel that her pre-marital innocence was not normal. Might make her feel inadequate as a wife. Then, you think it's possible she imagines that her coldness and inhibitions during marriage were the result of her inexperience before marriage? Exactly. And, of course, nothing could be further from the truth. But if she goes on thinking that way, blaming herself for what she ought to be most proud of she'll end up destroying herself. Someone has got to make her understand that statistics don't make morality. You have the one and only cure. Love. Real love. Now, I'm hopelessly late. Paul. Come here. [soft music] [music continues] Marry me. [music continues] [music continues] Boy was right. Femme de glace. Frigid. So you don't wanna go through with it? I can't. Why? Why? Why? Because I love you. That makes sense to you? You've decided to crawl back in your shell because you love me? - Exactly. - You're driving me up the wall. Isn't it better that you know now rather than after we.. ...rather than later? My natural inclination is to get the hell out of here. But I'm not. You're nobody's fool. This is no whim. I have nowhere to go. You father is not home. Tomorrow is Sunday. [scoffs] - You've crawled back! - You said that. Crawled back into the role of a mourning widow. Well, it's a bore. I'm and I'm sure your friends are bored with your problems. It wasn't Boy's fault. I'm only half a woman. I'm incapable. It finally becomes a bore! Don't you think I know that? You're not the first woman to be afraid. To find the physical act repellent. And you didn't invent that fear. Fear was obviously brought on because Boy was insensitive. But you comparing him with me. Do you think, I'd chance it if I weren't sure. You've got to break away from all these. And your father. You can't go on being daddy's little girl. Paul. I love you. I.. [soft music] - Getting a late start. - Well, it's Sunday morning. - Last night was Saturday night. - Not just any Saturday night. Let's get on with it. Three percent, I'm not in love with my husband. Ten percent, not sure. Eighty seven percent, I'm in love with my husband. Eighty seven percent. - Pretty good odds. - For what? For a man, say me, to marry a Briarwood girl. Ah, I see what you mean about last night being special. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Your odds were just as good in New York or any other big city for that matter. It is too late to change now. Good. I found that within a percentage point good marriages to bad are the same in Boston, New York, Chicago. But the bad ones are so vivid that we lose sight of the fact that the vast majority falls right into this column of happily married women...and men. I'm really delighted, Paul. Section 3. And I look forward to meeting the future Mrs. Radford. Column 2, question 1. Ten percent, strongly.. What about, uh, what about dinner tonight? Fine. Question 2. Twenty seven percent, somewhat. Sixty three percent, not at all. (Dr. Chapman) 'Question 3.' (Paul) 'Thirty nine percent, yes. Sixty one percent, no.' [instrumental music]
