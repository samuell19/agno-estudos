Because, I'm going to miss your face, that's why [Laughing] You got everything? Should be good Okay Alright Please be safe Love you Love you Alright Oh my Gosh [Birds Chirping] So I've been walking about an hour now And I believe I have finally arrived at the shoal that I'm looking for Just wanted to take a break and tell you what is going on My name is Zach Weiland and I'm here on a 60 Day Survival Challenge I've got some limited tools a canteen a knife and some camera equipment and thats it I got a couple goals for the day and that is to find some clean drinkable water I need to build a shelter and I've also got to make a fire I'm running out of daylight and I have allot to do so I've got to get going I will check back in with you later [Birds Chirping] This is starting to look a little bit better So... we're losing some sunlight We've got some definite shade in here The creek bed basically disappeared We're just going to follow this little animal trail and see where it goes [Birds Chirping] We're looking for something that is going to be flat maybe ten or twelve feet above the potential water line this is looking a lot better You can see that natural dam right there With some severe flooding [Footsteps crunching leaves] Alright, I think we found what's going to be our base camp You guys have to check this out here [Birds Chirping] Alright so to the left that's the high ground that we're talking about [Birds Chirping] Down here this could be a potential food source Tadpoles, frogs, you know... who knows? Over here you can see that we got a lot of low hanging fruit wood and materials to help build the shelter with We got a log over here to the right So I'll go ahead and start cutting that in a minute Everything over here looks great We're going to start pulling logs out almost immediately [Footsteps leaves crunching] [Birds chirping] [Footsteps leaves crunching] [Sawing] [Chopping] We've got ten posts so um... this is going to take a while [Hammering] This is... the base or the framework As you can see we have two posts on this side Then we have our base three posts here another base another three posts And then two posts to knock her out there We're kind of burring daylight so I have to get going We're going to stack wood and branches all over here up each wall And then we'll top it off with some brush [Crickets] [Shifting wood] [Rustling branches & leaves] So we're at the end of the first day And I am absolutely wiped out But I think it's probably best if I go ahead and get some sleep and get a nice early start tomorrow Alright guys so it's the end of the first night I wanted to bring you inside The shelter you saw it from the outside um... Over here we have a wall We have a roof very thankful very thankful for the roof There is the stuff I brought And uh, yea... So that's it good night and we'll see you in the morning [Rustling Sounds] [Crickets] [Footsteps outside, crunching leaves getting closer] There is something out there [Crickets] [Zach's footsteps crunching leaves] [Crickets] [Zach's footsteps crunching leaves] [Zach's footsteps crunching leaves] [Zach's footsteps crunching leaves] [Zach's footsteps crunching leaves] [Eerie howling sounds from beyond the trees] [Zach's footsteps crunching leaves] [Birds Chirping] [Sigh] [Birds Chirping] So here we are day two morning one You see that I've taken the roof off um... already Did that first thing this morning So we going to actually put more of like a lean to kind of roof on there And it's going to a little more permanen and a lot more comfortable Goal two is... kind of symbiotic where we're going to have fire and then water So we can get some water boiled to drink This morning I'm going to explore the area a little bit While I'm looking for water [Birds chirping] I'm also looking for wild edibles that would be like black berries onions chick weed fire weed maybe a frog or a tadpole for some quick protein [Birds chirping} This is an overflow of a river so water has to be nearby This is a pretty massive flooding area and uh, so there is going to be some big water before too long [Birds chirping] Wow! We've got some fresh water Looks like we found our water source As you can see in the background its moving pretty quickly So that should ah... reduce a lot of the bacteria And what I've got here is a little stainless steel um... cup And this is what we are going to use to collect our water And then also boil it before we drink it that way we get rid of the parasites and all that bad stuff that uh... that makes you sick [Moving water] [Splash] [Splash] [Birds chirping] So, I'm going to try to get a fire going I'm going to put a little notch in this piece of wood for the spindle and then I'm going to spin the spindle in the notch that I made which should create a small ember and that ember I'm going to blow into a flame [Sticks rubbing] [Rustling leaves] [Blowing] [Blowing] [Birds chirping] [Heavy blowing] [Heavy blowing] [Heavy blowing] [Heavy blowing] [Fire crackling] [Rustling sticks] [Birds chirping] [Fire crackling] Alright [Branch Snap} Well, great news I've got fire! So that going to make life a lot easier So I couldn't be more happy right now So... we're going to go try to find some dinner and ah... I'm going to boil some water while we're trying to find dinner [Snap!] [Heavy breathing] This should also keep some of the bugs away So I got the fire going I got the water boiling Um... Now I'm going to go out and get some leaves to go on top of our shelter and ah... maybe find some dinner [Rustling branches and leaves] [Rustling branches and leaves] [Birds chirping] [Rustling branches and leaves] [Cracking campfire] While I was out Sigh I found a little bitty frog And ah all you can really eat on them are the legs so... it's not a lot of meat here and I'm just going to drape it over this stick that is not really that dry of a stick [Campfire crackling] So I think that's going to be pretty good right there [Campfire crackling] So I've got my food water fire and shelter Um... I'm just going to take it easy tonight and hang out here at camp You know the hope from here on out is we just keep improving everyday Maybe a little bit to the shelter maybe find a little bit more food and drink a little bit more water but overall I'm really pleased with a... with where I'm at right now [Campfire crackling] The fire is my best friend out here it's taken the place of my cell phone without it I don't have water I don't have as muchfood options I don't have warmth So... Yea... I got to keep feeding the fire so the fire keeps feeding me [Campfire crackling] [Howling] [Campfire crackling] [Heavy breathing] [Rustling] I keep hearing something from time to time I have no Idea what it is Um... but you know most things out here you just make some noise they'll go away [Footsteps crushing leave outside] [Rustling] [Yelling in the distance] [Rustling] [Howling in the distance] [Footsteps crunching leaves nearby] Shit! There's something there! [Zach's footsteps crunching leaves & branches] [Howling in the distance] [Static] [Howling in the distance] [Groaning & howling] [Zach's footsteps crunching leaves & branches] [Groaning & howling] [Zach's footsteps crunching leaves & branches] [Groaning & howling] [Zach's footsteps crunching leaves & branches] Last night sigh... whatever that noise was was pretty pretty dam scary I'm not sure what it was Um... I'm going to setup a... a camera... tonight... to try to figure out what it is and then... most importantly I'm got to... I'm going to go get some water and try and find some food [Birds Chirping] This is a perfect log to forage typically you're going to find larva, grub worms... beetles stuff like that which are not my favorite things to eat but they're still protein [Birds chirping] [Low rumble] [Faint child's voice in the distance] [Low rumble Birds chirping] [Zach's footsteps crunching leaves & branches] [Low rumble] [Faint child's voice in the distance] [Low rumble Birds chirping] [Zach's footsteps crunching leaves & branches] [Low rumble Birds chirping] [Zach's footsteps crunching leaves & branches] [Low rumble Birds chirping] Alright I'm really excited because I found some green onions out here They grow in the wild all over the place I've actually got four in this area but today I'm only going to take two out That way I know I've got two come tomorrow So I'm just going to take these with me and ah... this is some really really great nutrition here very excited about this I'm going to eat the whole bulb I'm going to eat everything there is [Moving water] [Metal lid clanking] [Splash] [Zach's Footsteps crunching leaves] [Crackling fire] We went out foraging earlier today and ah... and came across these green onions All I'm going to do is rip these up... and then put them into the water Come back in about fifteen minutes and they should be good Alright... So ah... we're at a boil I kind of moved the camera around to give you a better angle but as you can see we're boiling I'm just going to let this cool this is still really hot I've got my chop stick here So I'm going to eat all the green onions right now and as it cools I'll drink that... later on tonight [Zach's Footsteps crunching leaves] So... [Cough] I've been hearing something moving around the shelter at night I just want to take a look around to see if I see anything [Leaves crunching] [Low Ruble] [Leaves crunching] [Crickets] [Leaves crunching] This looks good Oh, this is like a possum or a fox hole or some kind of den and that makes ... that makes sense that there is a fox den here or a possum den So that must be what I'm hearing at night God that makes me feel a lot better [Crickets] [Leaves crunching] So I'm just setting this camera up to see if I can catch anything on video [Fire popping & cracking] Had a really great day today Um... You know got soup in me which was awesome had some fiddle ferns as a snack just a really great day all the way around Very blessed day and I feel really good A... Lot of energy and I'm going to see you in the morning [Crickets] [Low rumble] [Groaning & howling in the distance] [Zach's footsteps crunching leaves] [Low rumble] [Loud groaning] [Female scream in the distance] [Female scream in the distance] [Leaves crunching] [Low rumble] [Leaves crunching] It's been a long day already I can definitely tell that I'm burring out quicker during the daytime I don't have enough calories taken in Um... I'm fucking tired it's weird not talking to people just being out here like... even just the... the two second conversation with the guy at the convenience store is a good conversation It's exhausting it really is, it's no joke I thought I did some training before I got out here but I needed a lot more [Birds chirping] [Birds chirping] When I come across roots like this typically it's a pretty good habitat for protein well it's been a few days since I've really eaten anything So... It's weird because I'm just not having any luck with any of these downed logs or places where you would typically find beetles and other kinds of insects So... I don't know [Crunching leaves] [Childs voice in the distance] [Crunching Leaves] [Childs voice in the distance] This looks like an old campsite [Childs voice in the distance] I keep hearing things [Crunching leaves] Yea, this is some bodies old campsite [Childs voice in the distance] [Crunching leaves] [Rustling pages] [Crunching leaves] [Fire crackling] When I was out getting water earlier I came across this journal Um... It was kind of buried... an ah... I didn't feel great before and now... I don't feel great at all whoever wrote this was seeing people hearing noises they were afraid they were going to die [Rustling pages] [Rustling pages] So... I can't take anymore of this right now Um... hard to read and ah... and its not going to make me sleep any better so I think I'm just going to go ahead and call it a night [Crickets] [Groaning] Sounds like its right outside [Groaning] They're everywhere I cannot take another night of this shit Sigh [Woman screaming] [Jolt!] [Crickets] [Woman screaming] [Low rumbling] [Groaning] [Zach's Footsteps crunching leaves] [Zach's Footsteps crunching leaves] [Woman screaming] [Jolt!] [Gasp!] [Zach's Footsteps crunching leaves] I swear I just saw a person [Running crunching leaves] [Rustling] Somebody put that here This is fucked up [Heavy breathing] Oh Shit... [Crunching leaves] I don't see anybody but they're out there I'm just... I'm agitated I don't know what the fuck to do with thing that I found in the front of the shelter this morning I'm just... eh... I don't know I mean I haven't been out here for a week and... I don't know... there is something around my shelter Its just... eh... you know I hear leaves and I hear noises and I get up and I don't see anything And it's.. it's.. It's fucking frightening is what it is You know... the fucking voodoo doll and the sticks like somebody has been here When... when you see this stuff on TV they talk about you know Make a fire Get some water Build a shelter Find some food They don't talk about what happens to your head when you're out here [Crunching leaves] [Crunching leaves] [Inaudible whisper] [Childs voice in the distance] [Low rumbling] [Childs voice in the distance] [Crunching leaves] [Childs voice in the distance] [Low rumbling] [Crunching leaves] [Inaudible whisper] [Crunching leaves] [Inaudible whisper] Oh Shit! [Shock!] Oh my God! Oh shit [Crunching leaves] [Low rumbling] [Crunching leaves] [Leaves crunching running] [Fire crackling} I'm not uh... I'm not one for camp fire ghost stories Um... folklore and all the kind of stuff But I got to... I got to admit that I'm a little I'm a little freaked out tonight My buddy was telling me about this... about the shoals when I was deciding where I wanted to go and do this He said that I was nuts because he had been out here before just over the weekend just camping and uh... he started talking about You know, the place is haunted and that's not something I put allot of stock in Um... I don't really believe in that kind of stuff in spirits and all that... that's just not for me Now I'm starting to think that maybe this wasn't a good idea [Low groaning in the distance] Ugh.. these sounds driving me crazy [Ruslting wood] [Wood cracking] [Wood cracking] [Low groaning in the distance] I'm going to need some more firewood but I'm not going out there again tonight [Silence] So I built this barrier it's a little protection but it's better than nothing at all just to try and keep whatever is out there... out there tomorrow I have got to reinforce this shelter [Low rumbling] You have that feeling that you're so alone out here and it's just you [Loud growling] [Woman screaming] [Woman screaming] Oh shit! [Low rumbling] [Loud screams!] [Woman screaming] Get the fuck out of here! [Footsteps nearby] [Footsteps closer] [Loud screams!] [Footsteps very close] Like this is some serious shit right now [Ruslting] [Footsteps outside] Get the fuck out of here! [Jolt!] [Ruslting] [Low rumble] [Footsteps nearby] [Loud screams!] [Footsteps] [Growling} [Ruslting outside] [Inaudible whisper] [Inaudible whisper] [Inaudible whisper] I'm uh... Reinforcing the shelter putting up a barrier just with more logs today something very basic but I think it's going to be pretty effective in trying to keep something out [Scraping wood] It's odd because I went and looked in the general area where I thought the sound was coming from today and... I couldn't see any tacks didn't see any sign of anything really [Wood snapping!] [Birds chirping] [Ruslting] So we're checking out the new shelter here It looks pretty good Nice and camouflaged [Brids chirping] I think it's going to help me sleep a little better at night Camp fire is a little close that's going to need to be moved [Crickets] [Campfire crackling] [Rustling pages] This journal talks about the horrible noises that fill the shoals I'm sick with fear [Rustling pages] It looks like a science expedition at first Um... it attacks Pulling on my legs as I sleep Swarms of insects I can't breathe I run and run I'm lost and I don't know where to go [Rustling] [Low rumbling] [Distant screams] [Leaves crunching] [Woman crying] [Low groaning in the distance] [Leaves crunching] [Low rumble] [Groaning] [Leaves crunching] [Leaves crunching] [Ghostly laughter] [Loud growling!] [Tree cracking] [Tree cracking and falling!] [BOOM! Tree hitting the ground!] Oh shit! [Heavy breathing] [Heavy breathing] [Woman crying] [Heavy breathing] [Howling] [Gasp!] Oh my God! [Heavy breathing] something is out there [Heavy breathing] [Loud growl!] [Massive tree cracking] [Cracking, breaking, snapping] Aaaahhh! [Tree branches and debris hitting the ground!] [Loud growling!] [Birds chirping] Deep breath, long sigh I can hardly believe that I'm still here [Birds chirping] I'm really lucky to be here this is one of the trees that fell last night it barely missed the shelter [Footsteps crunching leaves] [Footsteps crunching leaves] Holy Shit! You can see all the damage here [Footsteps crunching leaves & breaking small branches] it's like twenty feet away [Fire popping & crackling] You know its one thing to... focus everyday on fuel for the fire and fuel for your body and... trying to just survive out here but the things that in here just compound the situation and... make me allot more uncomfortable than I need to be [Howling wind] Yawn, its been a long day... really long day um... energy is pretty low I'm not eating enough I'm just not getting enough calories out here [Crickets] [Rustling] [Crickets] [Loud ROAR!] [Loud ROAR!] [Rustling] [Screaming] [Loud ROAR!] [Insects moving & buzzing] [Screaming] [Screaming] [Running crunching leaves & branches] [Screaming] [Leaves crunching] [Heavy breathing] I don't know if I got it on camera but the shelter was covered in insects I don't know what the hell is going on [Heavy breathing] [Leaves crunching] [Strange growl] [Leaves crunching] [Distant howling] [Leaves crunching] [Leaves crunching] [Slurping and hissing] [Loud growl!] Gasp! [Loud scream!] [Heavy breathing] [Leaves crunching] [Loud scream!] [Heavy breathing] [Leaves crunching] [Heavy breathing] [Insects] This thing is just following me I'm trying to find a place to stay tonight But there's not a lot of good places [Distant screams] [Distant growling] [Walking crunching leaves] I haven't slept I haven't eaten anything I'm totally lost and the rest of my gear is in the shelter [Walking crunching leaves] [Distant growling] [Faint childs voice in the distant] [Walking crunching leaves] [Faint childs voice in the distant] That's the shoal that I've been looking so now I know where I am [Walking crunching leaves] I'm just going to get some rest and uh... and dry my feet out because they're like fucking jungle rot right now [Rustling] The road is about two hours away [Walking crunching leaves] and there is no way I can spend another night out here I can't let that happen [Walking crunching leaves] Sigh... [Walking crunching leaves] Oh my God I'm so screwed I cannot believe this [Walking crunching leaves] Just trying to get away... get out I don't know... I don't know where I am there's three of these fucking shoals and... I'm just getting lost [Leaves crunching] I've got to keep going [Leaves crunching] I'm just not going to stop until I find the God dam road [Leaves crunching] [Leaves crunching] Sigh... Alright Zach get it together man You can handle this we just got to get out of here Make a plan keep walking... and get there [Leaves crunching] I'm being followed out here something is stalking me I keep hearing shit and it changes direction [Leaves crunching] [Leaves crunching] [Childs voice inaudible] [Leaves crunching] Alright this is not good If anyone finds this my name is Zach Weiland [Loud Scream!] [Loud Scream!] Oh Shit! [Scream!] [Heavy Breathing] [Running crunching leaves] [Scream!] [Heavy Breathing] [Running crunching leaves] [Scream!] [Heavy Breathing] [Running crunching leaves] [Heavy breathing] [Crunching leaves] [Heavy breathing] [Heavy breathing] [Crunching leaves] [Heavy breathing] [Walking crunching leaves] [Inaudible whisper] [Inaudible whispering] [Distant howling] [Inaudible whispering] [Footsteps nearby] [Growling] [Inaudible whispering] [Insects] I can't find the road Like the familiar places I'm good with So like this is the shelter right here I know that I've walked this area for days trying to make it out when I discovered the shelter area for the first time where we going to have the campsite I came in on the left So I know I've got to go in this direction But what keeps happening is... I keep getting turned around over here The road has got to be somewhere... somewhere beyond this Maybe... Maybe two hours tops to get to the road This is about one o'clock and I've already been out this way about three o'clock and I've been out... maybe... maybe four or five o'clock But I know that it's not over here... on this side [Leaves crunching] [Leaves crunching] So each time I'm going out now I'm actually marking trees Just to try a leave a little bit of a trail because everything looks the same So... that way I know if I've been here before I should be able to find my way back and I shouldn't be as lost So what I should of done is retro spec was when I came in I should have marked myself a trail but I didn't I was just so excited to be out here Now I can't wait to fucking leave [Leaves crunching] [Leaves crunching] and now I'm stuck in hell [Leaves crunching] Literally I cannot find this road to save my life [Birds chirping] [Leaves crunching] [Birds chirping] [Leaves crunching] [Leaves crunching] [Birds chirping] [Leaves crunching] [Birds chirping] [Leaves crunching] [Insects buzzing] [Leaves crunching] [Birds chirping] Holy Shit [Leaves crunching] [Leaves crunching] Somebody is out there [Insects buzzing] [Loud growl] [Insects buzzing] [Insects buzzing] [Loud growl] [Running crunching leaves] [Insects buzzing] [Leaves crunching] Something is following me [Leaves crunching] I can hear their footsteps [Leaves crunching] [Chopping] So once I got all these [Exhale] filed down [Leaves crunching] I just stick them in here [Ruslting] and a... that should give me some nice protection from whatever is out here [Chopping] [Chopping] In addition to the spikes on the shelter [Chopping] I'm going to go ahead and give myself something for personal protection [Chopping] um... [Chopping] while I'm in the shelter and walking around too [Distant howling] [Screams!] [Distant growl] [Footsteps approaching] [Distant howling] [Distant yelling] [Loud scream!] [Loud growl!] [Loud scream!] [Ruslting] [Distant howling] [Footsteps nearby] [Jolt!] [Scream!] Oh shit! [Footsteps nearby] [Low rumble] [Footsteps] [Low rumble] I don't know... I have no words It's a woman she's got black hair not wearing any shoes I don't know if she's living out here I don't I don't know... [Inaudible whispering] [Footsteps outside] [Footsteps outside] [Low rumble] [Inaudible] [Jolt!] [Inaudible speech] Last night was terrifying this is not a game anymore [Deep breath] [Metal lid clanking] [Footsteps] [Leaves crunching] [Leaves crunching] [Leaves crunching] [Leaves crunching] [Inaudible whispering] [Crunching leaves] Something's over there [Leaves crunching] Holy shit That's not natural [Leaves crunching] [Inaudible whispering] [Inaudible whispering] Whoa! [Inaudible whispering] [Leaves crunching] [Leaves crunching] [Leaves crunching] [Leaves crunching] This is fucking scary [Leaves crunching] [Low rumble] [Leaves crunching] oh shit [Woman crying in the distance] [Inaudible whispering] [Screams in the distance] [Leaves crunching] [Leaves crunching] [Howling in the distance] [Leaves crunching] [Running leaves crunching] [Leaves crunching & twigs breaking] Just beyond those trees [Leaves crunching] Do you hear that? [Leaves crunching] [Leaves crunching] [Leaves crunching] [Leaves crunching] [Fire crackling] [Insects] [Fire crackling] I'm going to go inside [Insects] [Fire crackling] Dammit Sigh I just hope this fucking thing doesn't come back tonight [Insects] [Insects] [rustling] [Howling] [Jolt!] [Gasp!] [Rustling camera] [Rustling] [Distant Scream] [Leaves crunching] [Distant Footsteps] [Distant scream] What do you want from me?! [Static] [Insects] I've got to find some food today [Insects] I need something... anything [Insects] [Birds chirping] just walking and scavenging everyday is what I do [Birds chirping] In trying to understand why I can't see any actual animals out here and very very few tracks It kind of makes sense that there just not out here because there's no bugs and If there no bugs then there no frogs and if there no frogs then there's no snakes and if there's no snakes then there's no possums and everything else so... I guess that makes a little bit of sense I'm just going to stop here and look in this tree... see if I can find anything in the roots here Typically I can find something to eat... beetles termites some kind of insect but I got nothing I cannot believe this I got to find the road Something's over there [Ghostly Laughter] [Distant howling] [Crunching leaves] [Birds chirping] [Crunching leaves] [Birds chirping] The road is suppose to be right here! Fuck! Sigh [Strange animal sound] I keep hearing shit I'm definitely being followed I hear branches and leaves crackling [Goaning] [Inaudible whispering] Sigh Jesus I don't even know what to do [Leaves crunching] I'm just going to try to stay quiet [Inaudible whispering] Long sigh [Groaning in the distance] [Leaves crunching] [Leaves crunching] Fuck! Heavy breathing] [Leaves crunching] Sigh It's getting closer [Leaves crunching] [Groaning closer] I got to keep going [Leaves crunching] [Groaning closer] [Leaves crunching] There it is Back at the shelter It's a sight for sore eyes I just wish I was on the road right now [Screaming] [Anxious sigh] This is just absolutely miserable This is not fun at all [Insects] The only sign of civilization I have is the plane that flies over head every now and then [Groaning] Shit! [Low rumble] [Distant howling] [Jolt!] [Gasp!] [Rustling] [Loud growl!] [Rustling] [Jolt!] [Gasp!] [Loud growl!] [Jolt!] [Grunting] [Jolt!] [Loud Rumble] [Evil Scream!]
