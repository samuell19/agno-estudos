(GROWLING) (GRUNTING) (GASPS) Look. Egads. See, professor? The ancient carvings, just as I promised you. - So the legend is true. - Whoa! Yes. It's all here, just as the manuscript describes. Ha-ha! I've found it at last. Come, Pemba. The lost kingdom of Shangri-la awaits. (JEFFRIES GRUNTS) What? I am sorry, professor. We dare not go further. These lands are forbidden. Forbidden? Ha-ha-ha! By whom? Look around. We're the only ones here. No... ...we are not alone. (ROARING) We should not be here. He is coming. Oof! No, Pemba. We can't quit now, not when we're so close. PEMBA: You do not understand. We must hurry. JEFFRIES: Then I'll go alone. (PEMBA YELLS) (GROANS) PEMBA: Wait! Professor! Professor! (GASPS) (ROARING) No! (PEMBA SCREAMS) (PEMBA GRUNTING) (PANTING) I have seen the creature. (DAPHNE SIGHS) Don't you just love Paris? The city, the sights, the shopping. Isn't it romantic, Freddie? (CELL PHONE BEEPING) FRED: Oh, man, I think I'm in love. This new cell phone rocks. It's got hi-def video, an MP3 player, even satellite GPS. I'm, like, totally geeking. Really? How can you tell? I don't know which is worse: Fred and his phone, or you and your newspapers. I thought we were supposed to be on vacation. We are. You know how I like reading in a foreign language. Listen to this, gang. Climbers on Mount Everest claim to have seen the abominable snowman... ...a mysterious creature believed to exist in the high Himalayas. Oh, no. Not this time, Velma. I don't care if it's in English, French or Swahili. There will be no talk of mysteries or monsters on this trip. Do you hear me? Yes, I hear you. Can I have my cheeks back now? Speaking of mysteries, Shaggy and Scooby were supposed to meet us... ...over an hour ago. Where could they be? Knowing those two, they've probably been sidetracked by their stomachs. Mmm. Yummy. (BELCHES AND LAUGHS) (SHAGGY CHUCKLES) What a great idea, Scoob. Like, I've always wanted to fly an all-you-can-eat airline. Yeah, me too. Like, gee whiz. Shouldn't we have landed in Paris by now? (GRUNTS) PILOT: We're coming up on the drop zone. Mount Everest, dead ahead. Aha-ha! Mount Everest, tallest mountain in the world... ...and home to the abominable snowman. - So you're really going through with this? - But of course. I am Alphonse Lafleur, the world's greatest hunter. Now, I come in search of the world's greatest prize. PILOT: But I thought the abominable snowman is just a myth. How do you catch a monster that may not even exist? (SPEAKS IN FRENCH) Ha-ha-ha! With a bait no monster can resist. (ALARM BUZZING) (SPEAKS IN FRENCH) What can they want now? Hello, anybody home? Hello? (SPEAKS IN FRENCH) And thank you for flying Alphonse Lafleur's Le Monde Grande Tours. We are going to be landing very shortly. Boy, are we glad to hear that. Like, my stomach is already coming in for a three-snack landing. (SPEAKS IN FRENCH) - You have eaten everything? - Almost. Like, I'm still saving the last slice of peanut butter and pineapple pizza... ...in case of an emergency. Hey. (SHAGGY SOBBING) Ah. The pooch is still hungry, no? We have lots of yummy goodies waiting for you in the VIP lounge. This is the VIP lounge? Oui, monsieur. You are on the package tour, no? I didn't know that that meant we were the package. SCOOBY: Ohh... LAFLEUR: Ha-ha! (SCOOBY WHIMPERING) You said it, Scoob. Like, I think we've just been bumped from first class to worst class. (SHAGGY AND SCOOBY SCREAMING) (SPEAKS IN FRENCH) (SCOOBY WHIMPERING) Zoinks, like, now, we know how it feels to be lost luggage. (THUD) (CELL PHONE RINGING) As if things weren't bad enough, now my ears are ringing. Shaggy, cell phone. Cell phone. Hey, my cell phone. Like, world's worst vacation ever, Shaggy speaking. Shaggy? I can barely hear you. Where are you guys? SHAGGY: Hang on, Freddie. Like, I think Scoob and I are about to go from frequent fliers to frequent criers. (BOTH WHIMPERING) (CELL PHONE BEEPS) FRED: Shaggy? Scooby? I've lost their signal. Can't you trace it with that high-tech GPS thingy? Yeah. With global positioning, I should be able to pinpoint their exact location. Just a little satellite tracking, and viola! Wait, this can't be right. Look. BOTH: The Himalayas? Home to Mount Everest. And the headline-making mystery of the abominable snowman. Now, hold on. Just because there's a mysterious monster on the loose... ...it doesn't necessarily mean that Shaggy and Scooby will get in trouble. Does it? We've got to get to Mount Everest. Everybody in the van. Sorry, Daphne, but it looks like you're trading in your new heels for snowshoes. Oh, just once, I'd like to have a vacation that stays a vacation. (TIRES SCREECHING) SHAGGY: Like, elevator going down. (SHAGGY AND SCOOBY SCREAMING) JEFFRIES: I'm very sorry, Pemba. I don't know what came over me. I should never have cut that rope. Without you, I quickly became lost... ...and wandered in the blinding snowstorm for hours. I barely made it back here alive. It is my own fault, professor. I should not have taken you as far as the forbidden lands. But you did, Pemba. And now the discovery of a lifetime is still within our grasp. The lost kingdom of Shangri-la... ...hidden from mankind for centuries. Why, it's an archeologist's dream. And it's right up there, just waiting for me. I mean, for us, of course. It's waiting for us. You may be right, but you forget. Something else is waiting there too. Don't you see? The abominable snowman must be guarding the secret entrance. - That's how close we are. - No. You do not understand. We have angered the creature, and now he will seek his revenge. That is why everyone is fleeing the village. Not everyone, it seems. Ah! Minga. - What are you doing here? - I've brought you some hot tea. No, I mean... (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER HEADPHONES) Hey, I'm listening to that. Why are you still in the village? You should be leaving with the others. I'm not a little girl anymore, Pemba. You can stop trying to frighten me with your monster stories now. Heh. Please excuse my sister, professor. She is as stubborn as a yak. So, Minga, you don't believe in the abominable snowman? When I was younger, Pemba used to try to scare me. "The yeti is going to get you." Now he's going around telling everyone that he's actually seen the creature. I am not kidding this time. The yeti is real. (SHAGGY AND SCOOBY SCREAMING) We may be freezing cold, but we're coming in hot. (THUD) (SHAGGY AND SCOOBY GRUNT) (BOTH GRUNT) JEFFRIES: Egads. Are you all right? Did you break anything? HIGH LAMA: What is this intrusion? PEMBA: I humbly apologize, most high lama, but... The monastery is closed. Now, go away. PEMBA: But look. Two strangers have fallen from the sky. Huh? Ahh! Indeed. May I offer you something warm to drink, ah? You must be very cold and tired after your long journey, huh? (CHUCKLING) Like, you had us at "warm." (TEETH CHATTERING) Uh-huh. (BOTH GROANING) (SCOOBY BURPS) I see you do not enjoy our yak-butter tea. Well, I'll say one thing. You can really taste the yak. Yuck. Do you mind if we use your phone? Our friends must think we've totally flaked on them. Like, snow-flaked, that is. Oh, brother. I am sorry, but we have no such modern conveniences here. SHAGGY: Like, wherever here is. SCOOBY: Hmm. (SCOOBY GROANING) Yikes, Shaggy! Monster. Monster. (SHAGGY LAUGHS) That's no monster, Scooby-Doo. -It's just some kind of creepy carving. SCOOBY: Huh? You have discovered our most sacred chamber. Like, way to go, Scoob. Why couldn't you discover something useful... ...like the refrigerator? Hee-hee-hee. Sorry. HIGH LAMA: In this chamber, we offer sacrifices to the yeti. Half man and half animal... ...he lives in the snow caves, high on the mountain. Like, there goes the neighborhood. (SCOOBY WHIMPERING) JEFFRIES: What an extraordinary crystal. May I examine it... ...closer? No, you may not. The crystal is sacred. Its mystical glow protects us from the creature's evil power. (BOTH GULP) - Evil power? - Evil power? (LAFLEUR LAUGHING) Bonjour, mes amis! Ha-ha-ha-ha! I have found you. Look out, Scoob. It's that terrible tour guide. SCOOBY: Yikes! Do you know this man? Yeah. Like, thanks to him, our grand tour took a grand detour. My sincerest apologies. There was a terrible mishap. I was so worried, that I jumped out of the plane myself... ...desperate to save you. Speaking of desperate, what about the rest of the gang? They must be worried sick about us. We're very popular, you know. Uh-huh. I know. Why don't you try calling your friends from the weather station? Weather station, eh? Well, what are we waiting for? Like, hook us up with that satellite hookup. It is a bit further up the mountain. I can take you there. The only place you are going is down the mountain. I would be honored to guide you to the weather station. JEFFRIES: I'll go too. With that snow creature out there, we'll have greater strength in numbers. (SPEAKS IN FRENCH) We will all climb the mountain together. HIGH LAMA: Beware, gentlemen. The yeti is the watcher of the guarded places... ...a realm of terrible danger... ...where those who seek the unknown meet their doom. Like, whatever happened to "bon voyage"? Yeah. (SCOOBY WHIMPERS) Admit it, Freddie. We're lost. We're not lost. We're just taking a shortcut. DAPHNE: Across Mongolia? FRED: Just keep an eye out for road signs to Timbuktu. So, Velma, what can you tell us about this abdominal snowman? Not "abdominal," Freddie. It's pronounced abominable. (STUTTERING) There are a number of different theories regarding the abominable snowman. And there have been many photographs taken of the yeti's footprints. Hold it. Back up. Yeti footprints? What on earth is a yeti? The yeti is the name used by the local mountain people to describe the creature. So the yeti and the subliminal snowman are the same thing? Not "subliminal," Fred. (STUTTERING) (FRED AND DAPHNE LAUGHING) - Now you've got me all mixed up. - I don't understand. What does any of this have to do with Shaggy and Scooby? There's no mystery there, Freddie. One thing we know for sure... ...those two always know how to find trouble. Scoob, old buddy, how did we ever wind up on this frozen freak-fest? I don't know, Shaggy. Like, what I wouldn't give right now for a nice warm Scooby Snack. Scooby Snacks? Ho-ho-ho! Well, why didn't you just say so? (SPEAKS IN FRENCH) Oh, boy. Scooby Snacks. Yeah. A whole year's supply of them. Ha-ha-ha! Like, maybe this trip wasn't such a bad idea after all, Scoob. Mountain climbing requires a lot of energy... ...so we must eat many times a day. Gee, Scoob, this sounds like a sport we could really sink our teeth into. Oh, yeah. That's the good stuff, Scoob. Yeah. How about you, professor? Like, got anything yummy to add to our impromptu potluck? Whoa. - Like, what is all this stuff? - Don't touch that. I'm sorry. But this equipment is very sensitive. We'd better keep moving. Gee whiz. His equipment's not the only thing around here that's sensitive. Yeah, sensitive. (YETI GROWLING) Man, Scoob... ...the air is so thin up here, like, I think my lungs are gonna pop. Yeah, mine too. We must keep moving. The weather station is only a bit further. I think we're being followed. (SPEAKING IN FRENCH) You see? PEMBA: What did I tell you, professor? She is stubborn as a yak. MINGA: I was going to leave the village... ...but then I heard the weather report over the radio. There is a terrible snowstorm coming. I only followed to warn you. You and that radio. Every day, all you do is stare off into space... ...listening to that jabber- mouthed DJ playing his records. He's not a jabber-mouth. His beautiful voice is the only friend I have on this lonely mountain. Here, just listen. DJ: And here's a cut from their last album... ...recorded just before the band's tragic breakup. The song went on to become a one-hit wonder... ...after its use in a popular TV commercial for furniture polish. (MUSIC PLAYING) Wow, like, who would've thought... ...that you could get a radio station way up here? You can't. It is just the man at the weather station pretending to be a DJ. (GASPS) You have a crush on the weatherman. And now you're tagging along just for an excuse to meet him. That's not true. There is a storm coming. She is telling the truth. Look there. JEFFRIES: It could blow us right off this mountain. We've got to find shelter, and fast. PEMBA: We'll never make it. We're going to have to set up our tents here. - SCOOBY: Huh? - You mean, like, camping? Out here, with that psychotic snowman on the loose? Scoob, old buddy, if there's one thing I don't like about this plan... ...it's everything about this plan. Yeah. (SCOOBY WHIMPERING) SHAGGY: Okay, Scoob. You've got first watch. If that big-footed bogeyman shows his frozen face... ...he'll have to deal with Scooby-Doo, guard dog extraordinaire. Yeah. Guard dog. Scooby-Dooby-Doo. Hup, two, three, four. Hup, two, three, four. Hup, two, three, four. Like, Scoob, keep it down, will you? You wanna wake up the whole neighborhood? Oh. Hee-hee-hee. Sorry. (YETI ROARING) Ha-ha-ha! The creature. He knows we are here. (YETI ROARING) Zoinks, and, like, he doesn't sound too happy about it. Yeah. Mes amis, you cannot quit now. Sorry, like, Scoob and I need our beauty sleep. Not to worry, mes amis. Come. I show you something you like, eh? SHAGGY: Like, it's a laser light show. You see? The traps, they are set. First I catch the monster... ...then Shaggy and Scooby, they will go home. - What? Huh? - What? Huh? Like, I get it now. You're no tour guide. No, mon frère. I am Alphonse Lafleur, the greatest hunter in all the world. And we're just monster bait to help you catch that ice-cold cretin. Yeah. Monster bait. (YETI ROARING) SHAGGY: Zoinks! Aha-ha! At last, the creature, he is here. And, like, we're gone, man. Real gone. (LASERS BEEPING) (LAFLEUR YELLING) (GRUNTING) (GROANING) LAFLEUR: Ohh! (LAFLEUR SCREAMING) (YETI GRUNTING) (ROARS) YETI: Ooh... (YETI GROWLING) (FISH GIBBERING) (ROARS) (SHAGGY AND SCOOBY SCREAMING) What is going on out here? SHAGGY: Like, you don't wanna know. PEMBA: Huh? (ROARING) (LASERS BEEPING) No! Zoinks! Like, if I wasn't freezing, I'd be having a major meltdown. (SHAGGY AND SCOOBY SCREAMING) (RUMBLING) (BOTH SCREAMING) Shaggy? Scooby? Is that really you? SHAGGY & SCOOBY: Huh? It's me, Del Chillman. Wow, what are you guys doing up here? Would you believe it? We're on vacation. Yeah, vacation. (WIND HOWLING) So Shaggy and the poochie have hitched a ride, eh? No matter. Ha-ha-ha-ha. Where they go, the monster is sure to follow. DEL: Well, sorry you can't call the rest of the gang. It looks like the snowstorm has blocked out the satellite. But, boy, am I glad to see you guys. I don't get too many visitors up here. Oh, boy, hot chocolate. Yum, yum. SHAGGY: The last time we saw you... ...all you cared about was the Loch Ness monster. Like, what happened? Nessie was a no-show. I was so bummed. But then it hit me. What if I got a job up here and used my free time... ...to search for proof of the abominable snowman? (MACHINE BUZZING) Hang on, guys. (DEL CLEARS THROAT) (IN DJ VOICE) Hello, out there. Today's weather report: A major snowstorm is blowing through... ...with highs in the low minus 40s. You're chilling with Del Chillman... ...spinning music for your mountain morning. (BLUES MUSIC PLAYING) Wow, this is some groovy collection you've got here. Yeah. So, like, your big assignment is to be a radio disc jockey? (IN NORMAL VOICE) Well, I'm only supposed to read the weather report... ...but it got lonely after a while. It helps to have someone to talk to, even though nobody's really listening. Except for this. Check it out. Cool, huh? On you, it looks good. It just showed up one day, along with this note. Listen. "Dear Del, I listen to your show every day. I hope you never leave the mountain." Wow. Once I heard that, I knew I just had to keep on rocking, man. I only wish I could stay longer. Like, "Signed, your number one fan." SCOOBY: Hmm. Hey, I've got an awesome idea. Why don't you guys be the guest DJs on today's show? DJ? - Like, Scoob and me, as DJs? - Sure. You two can stay here and watch the station... ...while I head out to search for the other members of your party. (CHUCKLING) Like, Scoob and I can just keep the party going here. Yeah, yeah. Party. All right, then. Now, remember, that monster is still out there somewhere. So while I'm gone, whatever you do... (WHISPERING) ...do not open this door. Don't worry about us. The last thing we want is another run-in with that winter-wonder weirdo. Uh-huh. (SCOOBY MAKING SCRATCHING NOISES) (SCOOBY CHUCKLING) FRED: Wow, that sure was a long drive, but we made great time. DAPHNE: I can't even feel my legs anymore. VELMA: Are you sure this is the right place, Freddie? FRED: I think so, but I'm not sure. -My phone can't find a signal up here. DAPHNE: Hey, wait. You can't just leave us here. No. This mountain is cursed. The yaks are unhappy, for they feel the yeti's power. Come on, girls. We're going home. Okay. Deserted village, yeti's curse, creepy yak guy. Yeah, we're in the right place. Hello? Anybody home? - Jeepers, this place gives me the creeps. - Check it out. (DAPHNE GASPS) DAPHNE: Scooby Snacks! And where there's Scooby Snacks, Shaggy and Scooby won't be far away. VELMA: Don't be so sure, Freddie. Come take a look. FRED: Hey, those look like Shaggy and Scooby's tracks. But why would they be heading up the mountain? I don't know, gang, but I've got a hunch our next clue... ...will be waiting for us in thin air. (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) Like, greetings, radio listeners. Shaggy and Scooby, broadcasting live from the top of the world... ...spinning stacks of wax for all you frostbitten fans out there. Right, Scoob? (LAUGHING) Hey, Scoob. You wanna hear my radio voice? Yeah. (LAUGHS) (IN DJ VOICE) Like, put down your snow shovel and pick up that thin-air guitar. It's time to stay in and rock out. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) (YETI GROWLING) DAPHNE: What happened here? Daphne, freeze. I'm way ahead of you, sister. VELMA: No, freeze, as in, don't move. (DAPHNE GASPS) DAPHNE: Jeepers. Giant footprints. They must belong to the adorable snowman. Hold on, gang. There's something awfully strange about these tracks. I'll say. This snowman must wear a size-50 snowshoe. VELMA: But look closer. The creature's footprint, while larger in size... ...only sinks half as deep into the snow as Daphne's. But that doesn't make sense. How could I weigh more than a snow monster? There's got to be a reasonable explanation for this. (MAN MOANS) Hey, gang, over here. (MOANS) And that is the last thing I remember. I don't know what happened to the others. Don't worry, Pemba. By reading the footprints in the snow... ...we should be able to reconstruct the attack. From the looks of these tracks... ...I'd say Professor Jeffries snuck away on his own. But why go climbing by himself at night, in the middle of a snowstorm? What about Minga? I do not see her footprints anywhere. DAPHNE: It's like she just vanished. Well, gang, it looks like we've got a mystery on our hands. Jinkies, look. It's a radio. (PEMBA GASPS) That's Minga's. She never goes anywhere without it. Then she must've dropped it as the creature carried her away. You mean, Minga has been kidnapped by the abominable snowman? Oh, this is all my fault. I should never have returned to the mountain. And what about Shaggy and Scooby? They must still be out there somewhere. Oh, Scooby-Doo. Where are you? (ECHOING) SCOOBY (ON RADIO): Scooby-Dooby-Doo. SHAGGY: Ha-ha-ha! Like, that's right, old buddy. It's Scooby and Shaggy. They're on the radio. SHAGGY: And now, for all you mountain music lovers... ...it's time for your mid- morning traffic report. There's a six-yak pileup on the Tibetan tri-level... ...got you backed up all the way to the K2 off-ramp. So if you're traveling by yak this morning... ...try to give yourself an extra day or two, folks. (DRUMMING) What is it, Scoob? Can't you see I'm broadcasting here? (STAMMERING) Hey, you're right. Like, I forgot to check the temperature. Oh, better wear your mittens today, folks. It's a chilly 15 degrees below zero out there. (SHAGGY SCREAMS) (YETI ROARING) And, like, with a hundred- percent chance of snow monsters! Ladies and gentlemen... ...we interrupt our scheduled program to bring you this special report. SHAGGY: Like, live, as it happens. Hang on, folks. I've just been handed this important bulletin: Like, "Help!" (GROWLS) (BOTH WHIMPERING) (ROARS) YETI: Huh? Ah, table for one, monsieur? Like, your menu, sir. (ROARING) (SHAGGY AND SCOOBY SCREAMING) (BOTH CHUCKLE) Okay, Scoob, hit him with the old one-two. Yeah, one-two. Scooby-Dooby-Doo. (GROWLING) (SCOOBY WHIMPERING) Come on, champ. Give him the old double, backwards, super-duper Scooby spin. (YETI ROARING) (CROWD CHEERING) (BELL RINGS) (YETI ROARS) (SHAGGY AND SCOOBY SCREAM) (ROARING) We're trapped, Scooby-Doo. (SCOOBY SOBBING) - Help! - Help! (STATIC ON RADIO) Jinkies, we've lost them. We've got to get to that weather station, and fast. It is not far. You will see it just over that ridge. I am going to search for Minga... ...in the monster's cave. Pemba's right. We should split up. Daphne, you and I will head over to the weather station. No, thanks, Freddie. I'm going with Pemba. Okay, that's... Huh? You can pair up with Velma this time. Lucky me. FRED: All right, gang. Let's solve this mystery before Shaggy and Scooby wind up in the deep freeze. (ROARING) (BOTH SCREAMING) LAFLEUR: Aha-ha-ha! You think you can outsmart... ...Alphonse Lafleur, eh, beastie? (SHAGGY LAUGHS) Like, what took you so long? A couple of more seconds and we would've been abominable appetizers. Yeah. What did I tell you, huh? You must think like the creature, no? LAFLEUR: Whoa! Okay, maybe not so much thinking next time. (LAFLEUR SCREAMING) LAFLEUR: You come for Lafleur, eh? No, no, no. Lafleur has come for you. (ICE CRACKING) Huh? Hm. Oh, no. (LAFLEUR SCREAMS) (SPEAKING IN FRENCH) Monsieur Lafleur, he's gone. (SCOOBY WHIMPERING) Zoinks, like, lucky him. (YETI ROARING) SHAGGY & SCOOBY: Huh? SHAGGY & SCOOBY: Whoa! (BOTH GRUNT) (AIR HISSING) (SHAGGY SCREAMS) Shaggy. (YETI ROARING) (YETI GRUNTING) (SCOOBY GIGGLES) Hang on, Scoob. I'm hitching a ride. (YETI ROARING) SHAGGY: Ha-ha-ha! We made it. Scoob, old buddy, point this balloon toward Coolsville... ...and let's go home. Okay. There's the weather station, directly across the valley. (ENGINE APPROACHING) Listen, Freddie. Do you hear that? - Fred? Velma? - Del? Man, I thought you guys were in Paris. You've got to be kidding me. I asked them to fill in for me on the radio while I went out to look for the others. Meanwhile, Shaggy and Scooby were here... ...with more monster than they could handle. Maybe there was something else the snowman was after... ...besides Shaggy and Scooby. According to these inventory records, a few of your helium tanks are missing. - My what? - Helium tanks? Yeah, we use helium to fill up the weather balloons, but... They're missing? What would a snow creature want with pressurized helium? DEL: Whoa. Take a look at this. This is so weird. VELMA: That looks like a seismograph. A device used to detect underground vibrations. I knew that. DEL: And it's picking up some really strange vibes deep inside the mountain. Then maybe the next place to search for clues won't be on the mountain... ...but in it. DAPHNE: Hello? Anybody home? PEMBA: Minga, are you in here? Ow! - Are you all right? - I'm fine... ...but I think I just stubbed my toe on a clue. PEMBA: Helium? How strange. DAPHNE: And look, the gauge is on empty. I'm starting to think this abominable snowman... ...may be less snow and more man. Okay, Scooby-Doo, you got us up here. Now, like, how are we gonna get down? Uh... Hmm. Ah! BOTH: Whoa! Like, don't look now, Scoob... ...but I think our stock is about to take a serious plunge. (BOTH SCREAMING) Well, what do you know? Ha-ha-ha! That wasn't so bad after all. SCOOBY: Huh? HIGH LAMA: Do not be afraid, my young travelers. Zoinks, like, who's afraid? I am. I am wondering. What are you doing among the gravestones of the spirits? (BOTH STAMMERING) - Gravestones? - Gravestones? (ECHOING) Fear not, honored ones. Your good karma has at last brought you to safety. Welcome to the lost kingdom of Shangri-la. SHAGGY: Wow, the vibes in this place are too groovy for words. And, like, it's done wonders for your complexion. HIGH LAMA: For thousands of years... ...this mystical valley has been the source of eternal youth. Those who discover Shangri-la can never grow old... ...so long as they stay. Yeow! (SCOOBY SCREAMING AND WHIMPERING) Like, what is it now, Scooby-Doo? He pulled my tail. Pulled tail. Like, you say somebody pulled your tail? (MONKEYS LAUGHING AND GIBBERING) Hey, like, those chimps must think we're a couple of chumps. Oh, yeah? (SCOOBY GROWLING AND BARKING) (MONKEYS GIBBERING) Like, nobody makes a monkey out of you, right, Scooby-Doo? Yeah. (IMITATING MONKEY) (GIGGLING) Ha-ha-ha-ha. Apparently, I spoke too soon. HIGH LAMA: Ha-ha-ha. Indeed. This way, my friends. You may stay as long as you wish. SHAGGY: You know, Scoob, I could get used to a place like this. SCOOBY: Yeah, me too. VELMA: According to the data from the seismograph... ...this should be the right spot. (DEL YELLS) (ALL SCREAMING) Jinkies. The underground vibrations must be coming from down there. FRED: Come on, gang. It's time to put this mystery on ice. SHAGGY: Boy, Scoob, that High Lama sure seemed like an awfully wise man. But, like, you'd think, he'd have remembered... ...to tell us where to brush our teeth. Gee, for such a peaceful people, they sure had a lot of creepy paintings. Yeah, creepy. Check this guy out, Scoob. Ha-ha-ha. Like, he must be the god of bad breath. (LAUGHING) Huh? (SNIFFS) Hmm. Yuck. And who's this? Like, talk about a bad hair day. Somebody paint this guy a hat. (SCOOBY LAUGHING) SHAGGY: Now, this guy's the ugliest one of them all. Hm? Huh? (SCREAMS) You're not kidding, Scoob. Like, who'd be his date for the prom? Tyrannosaurus rex? (SHAGGY LAUGHING) Shaggy... SHAGGY: I mean, with a face like that, he could go as himself for Halloween. (LAUGHING) Like, he's so ugly, he probably has to sneak up on himself in the mirror. (ROARING) Zoinks, it's the abominable snowman! And, like, I don't think he appreciates my honesty. Yikes! We gotta find someplace to hide from that bipolar polar bear. (YETI ROARING) (BOTH SCREAMING) SHAGGY: Like, check it out. This tunnel's got a split personality. FRED: Shaggy? Scooby? Is that you? Guys, it is you. Scooby-Dooby-Doo. SHAGGY: And, like, Shaggy too. Don't even think about it. (SHAGGY GRUNTS) Hey, guys. So, what happened up there? (RUMBLING) (ALL GRUNTING) More like, what's happening down here? DAPHNE: Jeepers. Was that an explosion? Check it out. Like, where did you guys come from? I'd love to catch up, but we can't stay here. This cave could collapse at any moment. (EXPLOSION) (RUMBLING) (ALL YELLING) DAPHNE: Jeepers. FRED: Wow. It's some kind of crystal cavern. SHAGGY: Now, this is what I call an underground scene. Look. There's somebody down there. PEMBA: It's Professor Jeffries. (JEFFRIES LAUGHING) Fire in the hole. So I did. Oh, Professor Jeffries, you are brilliant. Simply, marvelously brilliant. Come on, gang. I've got a plan to catch this crystal-craving creep. (JEFFRIES LAUGHING) Once I get down this desolate mountain... ...it'll be nothing but room service and warm, sunny beaches. The crystal! Like, looking for this? Come back here with that crystal. Finders keepers. Zoinks! And, like, losers snoozers. Mush, Scoob. Mush. Mush. Hit it! (JEFFRIES YELLING) A textbook example of how to catch a would-be snow monster. What? No, you've got it all wrong. I'm not the snowman. It all makes perfect sense. Professor Jeffries has been using the legend of the abominable snowman... ...to scare everyone off the mountain. I hate to interrupt, but it looks like there's still a few scares left... ...to this snow-monster mystery. (ROARING) Come on, gang, we gotta skedaddle. DEL: All aboard the Snowman Express. VELMA: Whoa! You're not out of this race yet, Jeffries, old boy. (SHAGGY AND SCOOBY SCREAMING) (ROARS) (ALL SCREAMING) (ROARING) (JEFFRIES LAUGHING) The crystal is mine! (FRED AND DEL GRUNT) The lost treasure of Shangri- la is lost no more. You can have it. And, like, what a deal. It comes with a matching snowman. (YETI ROARS) (GASPS) JEFFRIES: Ha-ha! (LAUGHING) (RUMBLING) (ALL SCREAMING) DEL: This is going to hurt! (ALL GROANING) I was right. That hurt. - Is everybody okay? - DEL: Yeah. What about Shaggy and Scooby? They must still be inside the mountain somewhere. Okay, gang. I've got a plan to catch this freezer-burned bogeyman. But we'll have to work fast. Come on. Del, you are driving. Right on. Ha-ha-ha! Jeffries, old boy, nothing can stop us now. SHAGGY: Hey, professor. Don't look now, but I think you're about to get schooled. Huh? (JEFFRIES GROANS) (YETI ROARS) (JEFFRIES SCREAMING) (YETI GRUNTING) SHAGGY: Like, I can't see a thing, Scoob. How about lighting one of those candles? Zoinks, like, that's no candle. It's a stick of dynamite! SCOOBY: Dynamite. (SHAGGY AND SCOOBY SCREAMING) (SHAGGY LAUGHING) - SCOOBY: Whew. - We made it, Scoob. We're alive. (RUMBLING) Huh? Whatever you're doing, Scoob, like, do it faster. Ta-da! Like, far out. Come on, Scoob. Like, let's shred this mountain before it shreds us. (BOTH GRUNTING) Way to go, Scoob. Way to go. Ha-ha-ha! Like, who knew you were such a hot dog? SCOOBY: Scooby-Dooby-Doo. (SCOOBY YODELS) Hate to be a back-seat boarder, but, like, what happens... ...when we run out of mountain? Huh? Okay, I think that should do it. Man, when they hit this baby, it's gonna be sweet. FRED: Way to go, guys. The slope looks perfect. Once they hit this last ramp, they'll catch air over the monastery wall... ...boosting right into the trap we made from the climbing ropes. And not a minute too soon. Here they come. It's Shaggy and Scooby. Uch. They're headed right for the trap. (BOTH GRUNTING) SCOOBY: Yahoo! (BOTH YELLING) (BOTH GRUNTING) (BOTH LAUGHING) Man, Scoob, that was one epic ride. Yeah, epic. (JEFFRIES LAUGHING) Sorry, old chum, but this mountain's just not big enough for the both of us. (YETI ROARS) (JEFFRIES LAUGHS THEN GASPS) (JEFFRIES SCREAMING) (JEFFRIES GRUNTING) Ha! Extraordinary. Yeah, man. It worked! Ha, ha! (RUMBLING) VELMA: Uh, Del...? Hang on, Velma. Oh, I'm hanging. They're not gonna make it. (GASPS) Whoa! Del! Jinkies! (YETI INHALING) Look. A flying abominable snowman? My mind is blown. That's no snowman. (SCOOBY GASPS) Try snow-woman. ALL: Minga. Minga Sherpa has been behind this monster mystery... ...from the very beginning. FRED: She used the helium tanks from the weather station... ...to fill her monster costume. That's how the yeti was able to climb so easily. VELMA: And that's also why the monster's footprints... ...didn't sink very deeply into the snow. I'm very sorry. I never meant to hurt anyone. But I don't understand. Why did you do it? All I really wanted was to listen to Del Chillman on the radio. You see, I am your number one fan. Really? When I learned that you were going to be leaving the mountain... ...I brought the yeti to life as a way of keeping you here. So, like, that's why she's trying so hard to scare us all. She just wanted to convince Del to stick around. Wow, that's so... (IN DJ VOICE) I mean, it's real cool, mama. (MINGA GIGGLING) As for Professor Jeffries... ...he was just using the legend of the yeti to cover up his scheme. And I would've gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for you meddling kids... ...and that mountain-climbing mutt, Scooby-Doo. Who, me? So, like, is the abominable snowman just a myth after all? LAFLEUR: No, mes amis. SHAGGY & SCOOBY: Alphonse Lafleur? The abominable snowman is real. Like, you're alive? Amazingly, I survived my terrible fall... ...from the high cliff. As I lay unconscious in the snow... ...something rescued me. The next thing I know, I found myself... ...out on the mountain, all alone. I can remember nothing else. Zoinks, like, I think, you remembered plenty. SCOOBY: Uh-huh. So there really is an abominable snowman? Right on. Sorry for all the trouble I've caused. Gee, Minga, what you did is so romantic... ...in a kind of twisted way, which I like. I'm just not sure where we go from here. I've got an idea. (DEL SPEAKING IN FRENCH) (MINGA GIGGLING) Oh, I am loving the Paris. SHAGGY: Like, us too. They say Paris is for lovers, right, Scoob? Ha-ha-ha! Well, I'm in love with this springtime spread. Oui, oui, Shaggy. Where's Freddie? He was supposed to meet us here an hour ago. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Can you believe it, Scoob? My ears are ringing again. It's your phone. Sheesh. Like, hello. Uh, guys? I think I got on the wrong plane. VELMA: Here we go again. DAPHNE: Ohh. Now where? Like, step on it, Scoob. Next stop, the Amazon jungle. (TIRES SCREECHING) SCOOBY: Scooby-Dooby-Doo. (SCOOBY LAUGHING)
