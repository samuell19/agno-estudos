- If you happened to look up in the skies over the weekend. Many of our viewers did. - Thousands of people saw these in the sky. - You were not the only one. - Another strange sighting. - We received a number of emails today asking about them. - This is the weird unsettling sight captured on tape. - Spotted in London, Mexico, Canada. - The United States Air Force said it could not identify. - People do not know what it is. - Just that they look like, very like-- - A benevolent entity. - They are peaceful. - Hey. - Rotten bitch. I'm gonna gut you like a deer. - Wake up. Wake up, wake up. Oh, god. You've gotta get up. - What are you doing? - Come on, come on. Come on! - Geez, quick, get him inside. Come on. - What the hell did you bring him in here for? - He'd have died if I hadn't. - So. What's that got to do with us? - She ran into one of those goons and he saved her or something. I don't know. - You're too soft, this isn't the old days. We can't be bringing in strays. It's all we can do to keep ourselves alive. - He might be useful. He could have skills. - Remember the last guy you said that about? If we we hadn't come back from foraging in time, think what he would have done to Penny. - I couldn't just leave him there. I'd have died if he hadn't come. I just couldn't. - Well, he doesn't look hurt too bad. Blow to the head and something chewed his arm up. - One of the Stexies got him and he killed it. He killed the Stexie and one of the goons. I got the other one. I put an arrow right in his back. - Huh, well, aren't you the one? I guess he can stay til he's better then he goes. In the meantime, we keep a close eye on him, agreed? - Whatever you say Kagen. - I lost my bow. - Damn it, Kay. We're short of weapons as it is. - But I got one of these. - Oh, that's one of the blasters. - Fair trade for a bow. - Take it to Zayden right now. - All right, but I'm keeping it. It's mine. I'm gonna figure out how to use it 'cause I was good with a bow and arrow, but with one of these things. - Be careful, you might blow your face off. - I wish we had an army of her. - She's too soft. Now, help me get this guy bandaged up. - Okay. - Bam, bam, bam. Sorry, sorry. - Oh, my god, you scared me to death. Is that an alien blaster? - It is. - Where did you find this? - Off a dead alien. - You killed him? - I sure did. - Wow, you're not the only one that's been doing things. Look at this. - Where did you find all this? - There's a store in town that hasn't been cleaned out yet. - You went into town on your own? - There's more, too. I hid it before I left. We can go back for it. - Penn, you can't be going in to town on your own. They look for us there, not to mention the gangs. - We hadn't seen anyone around in months. - It's still too dangerous. - I can take care of myself. - You can come on. I gotta go see Zayden. - Miles, that didn't work. - Have you tried inverting the chapel streams in the singularity path-- - No, no, no. I'm afraid that's gonna cause a flux in the plasma converters. I don't wanna do that. - I hadn't thought of that. Let me recalculate and I'll get back to you. - All right, thanks Miles. - Hey, Uncle Zayden. - Are we interrupting? - No, no, no-no-no, it's a critical sensor battery. It's being very touchy. But I'll figure it out. So what have you been up to? - Look what I have. - Huh-ho, where on earth? Spinach, kidney beans? Cream chipped beef? - I know you don't eat meat, but. - That's all right I never proselytize. If you girls wanna eat your fellow creatures like primitive savages. It's all right. German potato salad. We eat like a king for a week at least. - Oh, there's more. There's lots more. I'm gonna go back for it. - Not going alone you're not. - What about you? What's new and exciting in your world? Where did you find that? - I took it off a dead goon. - You found a dead goon. - I shot him dead. - It's so hard to believe that you are the same sweet little girl who cried for a week once when her father ran over a squirrel. - That's back when I had a father. - Well, that's a whole world ago. You know if I can figure out the principles behind this, this could make quite a difference. - When can I have it back? - Back, what for? - So I don't have to arm myself like a 13th century peasant. - Look, the physics behind this are entirely alien to me. I may never figure it out. So in the meantime, you're gonna have to make do with a crossbow and a sling. - I'd settle for a decent shotgun. - That's not my department. I'm a theoretical physicist not a gunsmith. - All right. I'll let you get back to work. - Uh-uh-uh oh, what about you? All right. - Zayden? - Hm? - I saw him again. - Saw who? - That stranger. The one that's been hiding from us. - What did he do? I saw him in the distance, but he watched me for awhile and then he disappeared again. - It's not him. It can't be him. He's dead. - Nobody saw him die. - He was outside in the blast. He caught the full force of the radiation. - I know, but. Good night. - Good night. - I knew he'd be nothing but trouble I just knew it. Kay, Penny, get out here. - Take it easy, lady. I don't want any trouble. - Liar, thief. - I'm not a liar. I don't wanna hurt anybody. But I am getting the hell out of here. And none of you bitches better try to stop me again. - Ha, ha. Ha. Ha. - It's all in the wrists. You give it a little twist and pop the head comes right off. We better go hide the body, before they come looking for it. - The goons? Why would they do that? - Trust me. - You seem to know a lot about them. - I've been around. - I'd like to talk you. Very unusual that we meet anybody who isn't trying to rob us or kill us. - How do we know he's not? - This is the second time I've saved her life. - Hey, I shot that goon that was gonna kill you back there and I dragged your ass back here. I could have left you for dead. We're even. - We're about to eat something. Why don't you join us? - All right, I never turn down food. - Smart man. - Looks like you eat pretty good around here. - Not always this good. - I found a new stash of food. - Oh, yeah? Where? Hm, I don't blame ya, I wouldn't tell me either. - You got a name? - Blake. - Oh, this is Kagen and Kay and Hugo and Penny and I'm Zayden. - Zayden, you look familiar. Like I've seen your face somewhere. - Uncle Zayden was a famous scientist. - Zayden Heisenberg? Nobel prize, physics. - That was a long time ago. - Huh, you never know who you'll run into these days. - What did you do before the invasion, Mr. Blake? - Just Blake. I was a crook. - What kind of crook? - I wasn't fussy. I preferred mostly small stuff, watches, jewelry. But I'd take whatever came along. - You don't seem very embarrassed about it. - I never carried a gun. I never hurt anybody and I hardly ever got caught. Besides, I figure we're all in the same boat anyway. We all grab what we can get. I was just ahead of the game. - I have to agree with him on that. Now, what were you saying about the aliens were gonna come back looking for the Clicket? - Clicket? Oh, the big bug. Yeah, they keep an eye on them. If they find one dead they get suspicious and start nosing around. That's one of the reasons they put them there. - Put them here? - Um-hm. - But I always assumed that the clickets were some sort of random mutation because of the radiation bombardment. Do you mean to say that the aliens deliberately placed them here? - Sure. - What for? - You know those little snails they used to put in aquariums to clean up all the leftover debris, well the clickets are the snails and we're the debris. - After we finish eating, Mr. Blake. - Just Blake. - Perhaps you'd like to take a look at my laboratory? - Laboratory? Sure, why not. Quite a display you've got here. - Oh, I know it all looks like a pile of junk. I've had to scrounge it wherever I could find. However, I have had some pretty impressive results. - What's the point? - I'm trying to learn as much as I can about our conquerors. I've been working with a number of other scientists by means of a primitive sort of radio hookup. - Aren't you worried about eavesdroppers? - Well at first, yes, but not anymore. I don't think they have radio. - Are you kidding me? They destroyed our entire civilization in less than a week. We're talking about pretty advanced technology here. - A totally alien technology. I don't even think they have the same senses as we do. They might see in infrared or hear color. I don't know. - Huh, so, where do you think they're from? Some other galaxy or? - Oh, I don't think so. I suspect another dimension maybe. I don't know. I mean it would help if I had a live specimen to examine, but so far all I have to work with is this. - Holy crap. Where did you get it? - Oh, Kay brought it back from one of her little excursions. - Aren't you full of surprises? - Now, you'll notice it has no ears. It has no auditory organs at all that I've been able to find. I don't even think they communicate by sound. And the eyes are interesting as well. But I don't think they see in the same spectrum as ours. It would help if I had better junk to work with. But I did manage to rig this up. - Where do you get your power? - Batteries charged by generator used sparingly, of course. The sound brings unwanted attention. - I thought you said they were deaf? - People aren't. We've had some unwelcome company. Present company excluded, maybe. - And look at this. - What a mess. No heart, no lungs, no nothing. - Yes, it's interesting isn't it? - I saw her kill him with an arrow. How could she do that if there's no vital organs? - I don't know. - You can sleep here tonight. - No handcuffs? - You're off probation. - Hm, so what, you guys family or? - We are now. - You call Heisenberg, Uncle Zayden. - Penny and I are the only blood relations. We had a brother, Alex, but. - Dead? - Nobody knows. He disappeared during the second bombardment. - Hm, then he's as good as dead. - You know I was hoping you were not as big an asshole as I thought you were. The more of us that band together, the better chance we have against the goons. - Hm, so that'd make me your big brother? - I'll see you in the morning. - What are your feelings on incest? - You do not want to mess with me. - Oh, you got me so scared. Ow, uncle! All right, you win. - You didn't think you had me did you? What? - Go ahead. - What do you mean? - Go ahead and do whatever you're gonna do. But afterwards no matter what, I will kill you. - What's wrong with you? - What's wrong with me? You attacked me. - Like hell I did. I was standing by the door and you twisted my arm off. - I was defending myself. - Not from me you weren't. I've never tried anything like that in my life and sure wouldn't start with you. - What the hell is that supposed to mean? - Hey, you've heard the expression I wouldn't sleep with you if you were the last woman on earth? Well, here we are and I'm still not that desperate. - You son of a bitch. - Thank you. - Are you all right? What the hell did you hit him in the head for? He already has a concussion? - What the hell's going on? - Nothing we were just. Nothing, I, are you all right? - I'm gonna sleep outside. It's too dangerous in here. - What was he doing to you? - Nothing. - Just getting acquainted, you know. - You go to bed, go on. - You know I'm not a child. - That's what worries me. Get moving. - Are you sure you're all right? - Yes, go away. - What are you doing? - I'm locking him in. - It won't do any good. - Then I'll lock you in, too. - Ha. - No-no, please, please don't. - Penny? Penny? Hey, wake up. Wake up. Penny is gone and I cannot find that son of a bitch Blake. - What? - We gotta go. - I'll kill him. - We should split up. - Wouldn't it be safer if we stayed together. - Sure, but we can cover more ground if we split up. Look we have no idea what could be happening to her right now. We have no time to lose, agreed? - Agreed. Agreed? - Agreed. - This music sucks. - Then find something else. - How many? - I'm good. - Ah, crap. Dealer takes three. - You're overthinking this, pal. - Call. - Full house. Queens high. - Son of a bitch. Okay, cutie. Off with your shirt. - No. - Zack. - Okay, okay, okay. - Where's Penny? Where's Penny? - Will you be quiet? They got her in there. Now if I take my hand away are you gonna be quiet? - What did you do to her? - I haven't been within 50 feet of her all night. I saw her sneaking away, so I followed her. She ran into those guys and they snatched her. - Why didn't you stop them? - Because there were three of them and one of me. They had weapons, I had nothing. You see how that works? - What have they done? Did they? - No, not as far as I can tell. They're having a little fun with her first. Hold on. We need a plan or at least a weapon anyway. - He has got a weapon. - Yeah, all right. Give me two minutes and then distract him. Without getting yourself killed. - This is it. Whoever wins this hand once she's butt naked, gets her. - Hey, what about me? - Relax, Who ever wins this hand gets her first. We'll all get a shot. - Hey, guys. - Shut up. This is a big hand. - Uh, but guys, guys. - Shut up. - Get, Penny. Sorry. - Come on. Don't be such a baby. No more mister nice guy. - Can't you go any faster? - Your sister's holding us up. - I don't have any shoes. It hurts. - Son of a bitch has a gun. - How many shells you got left? - Two. - Don't waste them all. - Oh, you are a freaking genius. You two go around and try to cut them off. I'm gonna come up behind. Drop it. I said put the crossbow down. See that guys. We had one chick to play with, now we got two. That's what we get for being good boys. Tie the girls up. - What about him? - He won't be any problem once I shoot him. - Holy shit! - What are you trying to pull? - No. - No, don't. Please don't. - What the-- - I can't believe you would be so stupid. What the hell do you think you were doing? - I was looking for more supplies. - In the middle of the night? You could have been killed. - Worse. - There's nothing worse. - Shut up. What the hell's wrong with you. - I'm sorry, okay. I'm sorry. I wanted to help. And if I went in daytime you would have stopped me. - You're damn right we would have. Do you have any idea how awful it would have been for us if we had lost you? - Come on now. Go to bed, scoot. - I'm sorry. - For what? - For what I was thinking about you. - Anyone would have thought the same thing. - Maybe you're not such a bad guy. - Are you kidding? I'm a prince. What the hell was that creature we saw? - The one who saved us? - I guess. - I have no idea. - It seemed to recognize you. - Well, I've never seen him before. - Him? You know a kiss on the cheek won't hold me forever. - It'll have to do. - What was that? - Nothing, go back to sleep. What the hell's going on in here? - I think I figured this device out. - What gives? - Remember how I told you I thought the aliens were from another dimension? - Um-hm. - Now I'm sure of it. - Zayden? Zayden, are you there? I lost signal for a minute. - I'm here, Miles. You were right about the auxiliary vortex field. - I told you it was dangerous and not to mess with it. - I know that's what you were right about. I think we're on to something here, Miles. - All right, I'll recheck those calculations and get back to you. - My fellow scientists and I have been analyzing the physical principles behind this device and it seems that the way this device functions indicates an underlying quantum principle that does not exist in our universe. What I'm trying to say is this gun here that I am holding shouldn't exist in our universe either. - You mean like antimatter. - No, no, no-no, well yes. But completely different. - Gotcha. - So you don't understand how the gun works? - No-no, I understand how it works, I just don't understand why it works? - Well, just try not to blow anything else up tonight. - So, you figured this out using all this rubbish? - No, Mr. Blake. - Just Blake. - I figured it out using this. - Oh, hell, now what? - Put her down! Everybody out of the corridor, now. I didn't know if the gas would work. You know if the biology was too different. - It looks half human. - I think he was human, once. - Penny's fine. - It was a harmless soporific. Blake tells me you've seen this creature? - Yeah, he saved us from the thugs. He must've followed us back here. - I sure hope those chains hold. - They will, if I keep him tranquilized. Is this the creature you were telling me about? Poor bastard. - You haven't seen him rip a man's arm off. - What is that? - They're running a scan. - Are they coming this way? - It's hard to tell. - It's okay, it's okay. We're safe. - No, please don't kill him. We need one alive. We need one alive. It's very important, please. - It is him. - Come, help me get the specimen inside. Extraordinary. - You know you're really taking your chances being out in broad daylight. - I can't find the door. - Well we watched the goon climb out of this thing and the door was right about here. - Yeah, not there is it? - It has to be, I saw it. - Well, it's not there now. I've looked over every inch of this thing a dozen times. There's no catch or anything anywhere. - There has to be. - How's the professor coming with his specimen? - Like a kid on Christmas morning. - I can't believe you don't have the thing tied down. - It's too weak to cause any trouble. - Screw that. He outta be buried in concrete. - I couldn't examine him then could I? - Yeah, but what if he gets up? - I was right about the eyes. Purely vestigial organs. His primary means of perception seems to be through his skin. - It sees through its skin? - Sort of. It's not that unusual. I mean certain earthly creatures can detect vibration, ultraviolet radiation, with pulses through their skin. - What's this? - It's some sort of helmet he was wearing. - Ow. - It's horrifying isn't it? I tried it on myself earlier. - Then why did you let him do it? - To see how he'd react. - Thanks a lot. - It seems to be some sort of adaptive device that allows the aliens to use their senses to perceive things in our universe. - So when I tried it on it made my senses work more like theirs? - Possibly. - Kay, I can see you, but I can see past you, too. Like I can see in the walls. It's not really seeing, but it's like I know it's there. - You all right? - I think so. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, that helps. - There's one more thing. Look at this. - What is that? - I don't know. But I'd love to get a better look at it. - Well, what's stopping you? - It would require surgery. I don't have the skills or the equipment. - Here you go. - Don't be ridiculous. I know nothing about its anatomy. I could kill it. - Isn't that kind of the point? - You're talking like a barbarian. - Am I? These things invaded our world. Destroyed our civilization. Killed how many innocent people. If cutting one of them up will help us learn a way to defeat them, I don't think we can afford to be squeamish. - Even in war, there are limits. - This isn't war. Wars end, life goes on. This is something entirely different. If we don't find a way to stop these things, there won't be anything left. - Blake! - All right, professor. You wanna closer look at this what's it, it's right about here wasn't it. There you go. - How's that? - Not the first time I've been stabbed, probably won't be the last. Thanks. - Does that hurt much? - Got my painkiller right here. - What is that? - It's either very new moonshine or very old kerosene. So, guess you probably think I'm a barbarian now, too? - You did what you thought had to do in a really tough spot. Who knows, maybe this will be the turning point. Maybe future generations will think of you as a hero. - Yeah? If there are any future generations. - Don't you think you should go easy on that? - Are you kidding? If there's one thing I can do it's handle my liquor. - Can you see it all right, Miles? - I can, I can but the picture's-- cutting out. You got that implanted in the alien? - Yes, when it was surgically removed, the alien dissolved. Almost as if the molecular bonds had broken down. - That's impossible. The resulting energy released-- - Yes, yes I know. I was making an analogy. - It almost looks like some type of receiver. - Yes, but for what? - Luther and his team have been investigating an anomalous energy source in this sector. - What kind of energy? - Not sure, it seems to be some sort of sub-quantum plasma vibration. - Do you think there could be some connection? - I think, who the hell knows? But, it's possible? - Don't think you've had enough of that? - I guess so, since there ain't anymore. - How're you feeling? - Pretty damn good. This is weird. Really weird, like when I had that thing on my head, only backwards. Does that make any sense? - No. - Oh, I guess it doesn't. - What? Are you feeling all right? - I'm feeling brilliant. Hi, you cutie. - You're drunk. - You're right. Mwah. - Send me the coordinates, Miles. This is important. This could be the key we're looking for. - Jayden, Jayden. - Not now, I'm busy. I'll break them down and send you the technical specs as soon as possible. - If this device is what I think it is, it's gonna answer a lot of questions. - Sometimes when I'm drunk, I'm brilliant. No, it's okay, it's okay. Oh, it's messed up. It's so messed up. Oh, it's so messed up. But I get it now. Watch this. Don't be scared, babe. - What are you doing? - I think I can fly this thing. - How? There aren't any controls. Anyway this ship is wrecked. - Self repair function. Somewhere around here. - What's that? - Ship's all better. You gotta drink? - No. - Ah, too bad, if I sober up, we're screwed. Okay, here goes. - What are you doing? - Shh, I gotta concentrate. Quiet, I gotta think. - Zayden, Zayden. Zayden! Look. - Don't be scared, babe. I feel great. - Yeah, that's what scares me. - What are those idiots doing? - I don't know. Making a miracle maybe. - Blake, this is scary. I can't see anything. - So what, you're not driving. - I know, but still. - Relax, babe. I know where I'm going. - Oh, but 're gonna get us killed. - No way kid. I got the hang of this thing. - But you can't see anything. - I don't need to see. The ship sees. I know everything that's out there. - What the hell was that? - I think it used to be a barn. - Blake you've made your point. You're wonderful, I get it. Just take us back. - Okay. Anything for you, baby. - Woo-wee. Uh-oh. - Uh-oh? - We got company, Auntie Em. - What kind of company? - Another one of these ships. - Hell. - Don't worry about it. They'll think we're friends, right? What else could they think? - Whew, this isn't friendly. - Oh, you wanna play, huh? Okay, let's play. That was awesome. Oh man, this isn't good. - What, what isn't good. - Oh, crap, I'm losing it. What's going on? - Adrenaline rush, you're sobering up. - I think I'm gonna puke. - No, no. - I'm gonna puke. - Set us down. Set us down. - Duck. - No, no. Thanks, man, I owe ya. - It was nothing. - Not to me it wasn't. I almost left the fun parts in there. - How's your head? - Oh, no need to shout. - Serves you right. - What happened? - I was hoping you could tell us. - I don't know. My shoulder was aching from the stab wound and I took a few drinks to deaden the pain and I guess I got a little tipsy. - A little tipsy. - And then, and then suddenly something clicked and all those weird scary images when I was wearing the helmet seemed to make sense. Like I knew that if I got it, I could fly the ship and we'd understand each other. - A symbiotic relationship with the ship. That fits with everything we've learned about the aliens. They're mindless. Essentially drones. Once the alcohol began to affect the neurotransmitters in your brain. - I became a drone? - But you still retained your human instincts. - Let me tell you something, Professor. Those guys can't fight for squat. All the destruction they rained down. It was like crop dusters. Just spraying a cornfield. Against an experienced fighter pilot those guys are hopeless. - Since when are you an experienced pilot? - Since you shut up. Let me tell you something. A handful of guys with ships like that, could take this planet back. - There might be a better way. - What's that? - If the aliens are from another dimension as we've suspected, it should be impossible for them to exist in ours. Their physical essence would vibrate at a different frequency so to speak, unless some device were compensating for this discrepancy. - So this is the device that allows them to exist in our dimension? - No, I believe that's just a receiver. They're all controlled from these central locations scattered around the planet. Command posts, if you will. - So we need to find the command posts and destroy them. - The problem is we're crippled by a lack of weaponry. - I've got a weapon. - Yeah, but you have to be stinking drunk to use it. - Sounds like a win-win to me. - We got this. - Oh, that's cooking wine. Bad cooking wine. - It smells like vinegar. You wouldn't even get a buzz off of that. You gotta have something else. - We don't do much drinking around here. We need sober heads on our shoulders. - Well right now you need a drunken head on your pilot. - I know where there's booze. - You do? - Back where those guys had me. There was a lot of booze there. - Yeah, that's right. Well, no time like the present. - Wait, better to go at night. Less likely to be spotted. - Yeah, you might be right. - And I'll go with you. - Why? - In case there's trouble. - If you come along, I know there'll be trouble. - It looks empty. - Yeah, well it would be. They're all dead. - It doesn't mean someone else hasn't moved in. - Yeah, I'll reconnoiter, you wait here. - Oh, sure. - You are one stubborn little cupcake. - Mm, here we go. - There's more over here. - Bring it here and start packing. - I don't like people messing with my stuff. - Ah, damn you got booze, you got guns. Looks like I signed up with the wrong side. - Too late to switch sides now. - Are you sure? - Oh, yeah. Get up, have a seat. Take those chains. Tie him up nice and tight. I don't want him messing with my plans. - What if I don't? - Then I'll kill you both. Nice and slow. An elbow, a kneecap. Glad you didn't try anything stupid. Come here. Take your clothes off. Don't do what I tell you, then I'm gonna kill him. Nice and slow, til he can't walk anymore. Whoa, whoa. Make it slow. Make it sexy. I wanna get warmed up first. Oh, yeah. No fricking golem's gonna save you this time. Oh, come on. - Alex, wait, Alex. I always knew that it was you. You don't have to hide from us. - No better way. - We can help you. You know how brilliant Zayden is. He and his colleagues will find a way to help make you better. - Better? I can see things and hear things you can't imagine I am strongest creature on the planet. Nothing can hurt me now. How can you make me better? Just a waste. I want this. I have a purpose. When you need me, I'll be there. - To Alex. - To Alex. - Now, that's enough. We have to conserve the alcohol. We're gonna need it for tomorrow morning. - So soon? - We found the closest of the alien control centers. It's only about 50 miles from here. I'll give you the exact coordinates in the morning. - Wouldn't it be safer to go at night? - No, it's better guarded at night. They have some kind of sentries on there. I don't know what they are exactly, but from what I can gather they're quite formidable. Well, I have one of my miraculous gadgets to finish and I think you all should get some rest. Tomorrow could be one of the most important days in the history of the world. - Good night, everyone. - Good night, Penny. - Well, I guess I outta get to bed, too. I got me some serious drinking to do in the morning. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - You want some company? - Why Miss, Miss. Say, do you have a last name? - Flanagan. - Do you have a first one? - Michael. - Hm. - Come on you lazy bastard, get up. Oh, I don't believe you two. - I'm a victim of circumstance. - Kay, get out of there. And you get to work. - Is he ready? - If he were any looser, we'd have to pour him into the ship with a funnel. - How many fingers am I holding up? - Eleventeen? - God help us. - This is a camera. It'll feed a signal into the ship and display on your screen so you'll have an idea of what's going outside. - What, me? What makes you think I'm going with him? - I'm a Nobel prize winning theoretical physicist. Won the Kernditz Prize and the Precolone and named world's smartest dude in the last ever issue of "Rolling Stone". I'm not entirely stupid. Here, good luck to you both. - Here, here's some backup in case you feel yourself sobering up. - Thanks, bro. Mwah. Come on, kid, let's go save the world. - Okay, you need to fly low to avoid detection. - I don't wanna. - Not that low. Pull up, pull up. - You fly this thing? Go ahead, take the wheel. - All right, I'm sorry. How are you feeling? You're not sobering up are you? - No. - Good, good. All right according to this data that Zayden gave us, right over the hill where the river bends there should be this kind of open plain and whatever it is we're looking for should be right there. - All right, Captain. Warp factor one. - All right, that must be it. What the hell are those things? - Sentries. Remember what Zayden said, they're the sentries. - You need to slow down. You're going too fast. They don't fly these things so fast. - That's 'cause they're pussies. - Slow down, you're attracting too much attention. - All right. - Oh, this isn't good. Something's wrong. - Relax, they'll think we're one of the gang. - No, no they don't. We're getting too close. - Everything's fine. Holy shit! - Get us out of here. Get us out of here. - Ah, damn, those babies mean business. - Okay, stop firing. I think we're out of range. - Incoming. He-he, piece of cake. Those suckers are too easy. Okay, round two. - We need a plan. - I gotta a plan. We're gonna book in there, kick some alien ass, then we're gonna get the hell out. - That isn't a real plan. - Oh, no? Watch this. - Retreat, get us out of here. - We're going down. - No, we can't. Do something. - I don't think I can do this anymore. The images is fading. I can't see. I don't know what's out there. - I can see. I can for you. - Oh, yes, the ship's getting away from me. - Okay, listen. I have a plan. I know what we have to do. - Let's hear it. - We can't outfight them and we can't outrun them. But what we can do is turn the ship around, fly it right back to that tower and put this piece of trash right into it. - We'll be killed. - I know, sweetie. But it's what we have to do. - You wanna play kamikaze. I can be a freaking kamikaze. Which way do I go? - 180. - Yee-haw. - Okay a little to the left. A little more. Oh, not so much. Okay, stay, stay. Okay, you're doing good. You're doing great. We're almost there. Pull up a little. Pull up. Bank right, hard right, hard right! Hey, wake up, get up. Up-up-up. Hey, what'd you do? What, what did you say? Self destruct, is that, is that what you said? Well, let's get the hell out of here. Come on. - Grab my hand. - Baby, I know what we should do. - What's that? - On the count of three. - Uh-huh. - Let go. - What? - We can't hold on. Let's, let's go together, ready? - No. - One. - Kay! - Two. - Kay, don't! - Three. - Kay! - Blake! - No! - Alex, the tower's gonna blow. You gotta get us out of here. Like how much time do we have? - I don't know. Not much. - Look. I mean, Jayden was right. We've won. - God, that's one powerful son of a bitch. Look like you got yourself a new king. - Eh, I guess that makes me the princess royal. - We won the battle but not the war. And only a local battle, at that. Things'll get harder before they get easier. We stung them. But they'll be on their guard. Still, it's a start. - And what about him? - I don't know. He may be their biggest blunder. From what you tell me they may have created an enemy so powerful even the aliens are helpless against him. - You think there are more like him? - Could be. It's possible. My god, can you imagine an army of those things. They'd be undefeatable. - That thing has a name. - I know. Let's go get something to eat. We're all going to need our strength. We have a war to plan.
