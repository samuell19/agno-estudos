Hello! The weather is so nice today! And on the radio they told it would rain. No, they must be wrong. Although, thinking objectively, it might. They know better up there. Actually, it's interesting to see whether it will. And if it will, then when. And if it won't, then for how long. What do you think? Certainly, the region is big, one cannot really predict where it will rain, let alone when. Must be a cyclone, at the very least. It means it will rain everywhere. And for long. Get it? There you are. Use your head. Have you seen Fyodor? Vasilich! What's up, Vasilich! What's up then. Where are you heading so early? I got some business. Business is good. So, you're going that way? So? Me too. Let's go. Going shopping? No. Neither am I. The weather is nice today. And on the radio they told it would rain. Have you heard? A cyclone has come. One doesn't know what to make of it. Of course, no one is guaranteed against making a mistake. But even without a scientific viewpoint, it's enough to take a look at the sky to learn everything. It cannot rain from the sky like this. Even if a cyclone has come. What do you think? Nothing. What are you going there for? Where? The same place as I am. I need to. Oh, well then. Left! Left! Wider! Left! Left! Left, Vasilich! Going that way? And you? I know which. For me, it's either way. I don't care. Listen, why are you following me? What do you need from me? Nothing really. Why? If nothing, then take a hike. Got it? Got it. I just wanted to talk to you, that's all. To talk then? What is there to talk about? Well, this and that. Why? Nothing, that's why. Stuck like a leech, like you got nothing to do. But it's Sunday. What is there to do on Sunday? How do I know? Weather, weather, right, left... Vasilich! Hang on! You owe me a tenner! That's the way the cookie crumbles! What tenner? The one you borrowed last week! You promised to give it back in two days. That tenner. Remember? I'll give it back. Swear to God, I will. I don't have it now. I'll give it back when I get my pension. You pension is a long way off. At a pinch or what? Just like that, get a tenner and give it back. Are you leaving or what? No, not really... Why? One gets back the money only when one leaves? Since you're not leaving, you'll have to wait. Nothing will happen to you. Got it? Got it. Farewell then. I would also be sleeping, but the weather is nice. Although, they said it'd rain. Maybe, they were wrong. It's a tricky one. One cannot really tell. Nature is nature. Filomeyev! Where are you going? Must be going bathing. Where else would they be going. They shouldn't though. The water is still cold. I went the day before yesterday. The water was chilling. Just in and out. It's too early for bathing. This time last year, it was much warmer. And still no one went bathing. And this year all the more so. You step in the water knee-deep, and that's it. A cramp. Besides, it'll rain. They promised, after all. Alright, I gotta get going. I can just as well sit here all my life, it still won't do me any good. Besides, I got plenty of stuff to do. Hello, Tatyana Ivanovna. Hello. Still whistling, I see. Whistling. The weather is nice today. It is indeed. And on the radio they told it would rain. I know. So what? Nothing really. Is Natalya at home? She is. I'll drop in? Don't even think about it. Just for a minute. In and out. Enough of dropping in. Don't even set foot there. Got it? Got it. Where are you going? To Fedya's. Yeah, right. I know you. Mind you, if I get to know, you'll be in trouble. In such trouble, you can't even imagine. Already? Already. Is Fyodor at home? He is. Since you're here, do come in. So you're here. What else is there to do? Exactly. There's nothing to do. Don't just stand there, have a seat. Take off that coat. I'll be back. Bless you. Valya! We've put it out to dry, while the weather is good. Take the coat, will you? It stinks of naphthaline. Fancy some tea? Maybe I'd better bring some beer? No way. It's the same every time. As soon as you've begun, you can't stop. I'll smoke? Go ahead. And you? I already did. Just now. Before you came. The weather is nice today. Isn't it? And on the radio they told it would rain. They say, a cyclone has come. You heard? I did. I saw Vasilich today. I was going to the shop, and he was going my way. Anyway, he didn't hear. He was very surprised, how is it that the weather is so nice, the sun is shining its brightest, and out of the blue - rain. He didn't believe it. And Filomeyev went bathing with his family. That guy is totally nuts. I went the day before yesterday. It's too cold to wash one's face, let alone to bathe. Still, it will rain. Although, it doesn't look like it. What do you think, Fedya? Maybe, it will. And maybe not. Don't take offence, Kolya, but I couldn't care less, whether it will or not. It doesn't make any difference. It does make a difference. Maybe it does for you, but for us it doesn't at all. Only if on principle. But in fact it doesn't. Whether it will or not, whether this way or the other. Of course it does matter. You bought an umbrella or what? No. Of course, you didn't. Had you bought an umbrella, we'd have known a long time ago. Why don't you say something? Something new. Nothing to say really. Why? Nothing then? Nothing, actually. It's just that I'm leaving. What? I'm leaving, that's what. Where are you going to? Some business turned up. When did it turn up? You weren't going anywhere yesterday. Well, it did turn up. So now, I'm leaving. The least I need now is rain. Because, it's nasty to leave in the rain. What do you think, will it rain or not? It doesn't look like it will. Birds are flying high. It's good, maybe it won't then. So where are you going? I'm going far. Far. I'll send you letters once in a month. Where to - far? That way. To the Far East. That's it. Why would you go to the Far East? A friend has invited me. What friend? You've never had one. Except for me, of course. Yes, I have. We used to go to school together. He... I used to sit at the last desk, and he - at the front one. And now, he's a big boss. Why haven't I heard about it before? I haven't heard about it myself. Until he sent me a letter, that is. And when he did, I decided to go, at once. Why would I sit here doing nothing? At least, I'll have some worthwhile work there. What are you going to do there? There's something concerning supplies. Are you serious? I am. In fact, I've come here to tell you about it. Well done. Well done, congratulations. I really, really congratulate you. Valya. Valya. I think I saw some beer in the fridge. You certainly did. Well done. This calls for a celebration. That's nothing, guys. Some fish perhaps? Of course. It'll go just fine with beer. Well, Kolya! For departure! For departure! For departure! Kolya, when are you leaving? Soon. Soon? When is this your soon? When? Why? Why what? Maybe you'll be blabbering all week, and won't go anywhere in the end. So I'm asking, when are you leaving? Why are you pestering him? He said, he's leaving one of these days. Is that right, Kolya? Right. What difference does it make, whether now or tomorrow? It's not about time, it's about space. Well, if tomorrow, one still needs to live that long. Not tomorrow. I'm leaving today. You heard? Got it? Today. Well done, buddy. Have a bit of fish. We wangled it. Although, there must be a lot of fish there, you'll even get sick of it. Of course. Thanks, I'll eat it there. Thanks again, but I gotta be going. What's the rush? Stay here for a while, tell us more about it. No, I have to go. I got a lot of stuff to do. Of course, you have to pack up, otherwise you might be late. Yeah. I need to pack up. I've stayed too long already. Gotta go. Alright. If you have to, you have to. Need any help? I can help you. You know that, I'm always there if you need me. Kolya, is Natalya going too? Natalya? No, she's not. So you're ditching her? Why is that? You're going, she's not. That's it then? Like ships that pass in the night? Actually, it looks like it, but in fact... Have you told her that you're leaving? No, I haven't. How is that supposed to work then? What? How are you going to tell her? How will you look into her eyes? I'll just tell her, while looking into her eyes. She told me even worse things. And she also looked into my eyes. So it'll be alright. And where are you going? To buy cigarettes. I don't have to stay at home. Alright then, in that case, goodbye. Goodbye. Maybe we'll never see each other again. Let me kiss you. He's leaving in the evening. You'll have time to say goodbye twice. Yeah, stop that. Let's go. Have you told anyone? No, you're the first ones. Well done. I've never doubted you. You're a real friend. Aren't you sorry to leave? After all, you've spend so much time here. And suddenly - adieu, you're leaving. I don't know really, it's difficult to say right away. You haven't realized yet. You haven't felt it deeply. And when you will... Kolya! Although, of course, the Far East... Different life, and so on... You must be all there already, things to do, things to take care of... I envy you, you know. I've never envied you before! And now I do. Hello, dear neighbours. You heard, what our Kolya's been up to? You don't know, do you? You'll be stupefied. Don't blabber, knock it off! Why not? Why can't I tell them? They'll learn anyway. What's going on there? See? They're already interested. You bastard! I didn't mean to! I'm leaving! What? I'm leaving, that's what! Where are you going? Don't you lie to me! That's true, he is leaving! A friend has invited him. To the Far East, to the ocean. Leaving? Of course. What do you think, I have nothing else to do than go see your Natalya? So you're leaving? Nothing else to do then? Alright then. Good riddance. And about time, too! I'm pretty sick of you by now. Stuck like a leech. Just won't go away. Leave then. At least, it's better than hanging around. It'll be much quieter without you. Leave! Good riddance! I spit on you! Hope I'll never see you again! Scary woman. Terrorist. Going far? What was that? I said, are you going far? It's not me who's going, it's him. And when? He's leaving today. So quickly? Why wait? One can wait all one's life. I've been waiting like a fool, and now... Why are you dressed up like that? It's Sunday. And, besides, Kolya is leaving. So why not? Certainly, why not. I have nothing against it. As you like. Where's everybody? Why is no one here? Who knows. Maybe, it's too early. Kolya? What time are you leaving? I don't know yet. How is that? Haven't decided or what? I have. I'm going in the evening. The last bus? Exactly. Well done! Now he's here, and the next moment... he's gone. I'm still here. It's not for long. Tomorrow you'll be far away. So far, you can't even imagine. Are you going via Moscow? Via Moscow, yes. How lucky he is. What are you staring at? Nothing. Here comes Filomeyev after bathing! I said that the water is too cold! Alright. Enough of fooling around. You need to pack up. It's evening soon. We might not have enough time. Come on, that's nothing. I wouldn't say so. It's no joke, it's once in a lifetime. After all, my best friend is leaving. It's not nothing. Hello, Fedya! Hello. What are you doing with all these people? Are you going to play together? Hello, Valya! Are you taking them under your patronage? We went bathing early in the morning. The water is ice cold, guys. You get a cramp at once. It was warmer last year. But for sunbathing it's just alright. Burns like an iron. Just look at this. Look, grannies. Enough of fooling around. Let's go, Kolya. Hello, Kolya. Hello. Where is he taking you? I'm accompanying him, got it? Got it. Who are you accompanying? Don't you know? I don't. Really? Nothing at all? Nothing. I'm accompanying Kolya. That's what's up. Kolya? Are you going to the downtown? Downtown my ass. He's leaving for good. At first, to Moscow. Then to the Far East. To the Pacific Ocean. Got it? To the Pacific Ocean? Why to the Pacific Ocean? Bug off. Anyway. Stop that interview, we need to pack up. There's a lot of things to do. So I'm asking those accompanying to bug off to the platform. The train is leaving. Give regards to your parents. Give regards to your parents. We'll manage by ourselves. Go for a walk. Try your dress. Right. Where is your suitcase? Fedya, hang on. Forget the suitcase. Just have a seat. I have to think. What is there to think about? No need to think. Everything is clear. What the hell, Kolya, if you only knew, how glad I am for you! If it happened to me, I wouldn't look as miserable as you do. Keep you chin up, Kolya! I almost feel embarrassed for you. Kolya, what's going on? I see you're not alone. Hello, Filip Makarych. Hello. What's going on, Kolya? What? All this, you know. So you have decided? Decided what? This. Departure. Did I have any doubts? Of course you did, Kolya. Of course. Don't you remember? Try to remember. Remember how in the evenings you talked to me, asked for my advice about life, about people, and about what you should do with your life. Remember? I explained to you that every person has to find their own place, their own goal. Remember? I don't really know. I cannot remember it all at once. Nevermind. You'll remember. Good deeds are never forgotten. What I wanted to tell you, Kolya... Oh, yes, you did right to have heeded my advice. Now I don't worry for you any more. Now I believe in you, Kolya. Thank you, Filip Makarych. Although... I'll be going then. Don't want to be in your way. And while there's still hot water. Do you mind if I take one of those? Go ahead. What was he talking about? Like you decided to leave because of his advice! Advice my ass. Blabbering as usual. You know, sometimes in the evening, I come home, sit down, nothing to do... Even no one to talk to. I have only one neighbour, so I listen to him. You better watch out! Now every stranger who exchanged a few words with you can take the credit for setting you on the right path! I know that kind! When push comes to shove, there's no one to help! So where's you suitcase? I don't have one. And I've never had. What do you mean, you've never had one? How are you going to leave without it? I don't know. Alright, you don't have a suitcase. What do you have? I have a bag. Go fetch it. Too small. And impossible to wash by now. Yeah, you definitely need a suitcase. But it's Sunday, the shop is closed. We'll have to wait till tomorrow. There's no other way. A suitcase is not a problem. We'll find it. Filomeyev! What is it? Come here! Business to discuss! Just look at that. Look, Kolya. There's a whole demonstration, universal workers' solidarity. And this is only beginning. I'll get that. Have a seat. Let's talk. Kolya is leaving. You know that. I do. He's going far and for long. Maybe even for good. Right, Kolya? And the shop is closed. Because it's Sunday. Can't be! Not that one, the other one. Anyway, we need a suitcase. And we don't have one. And you do. I do, so what? You give us the suitcase. And we'll offer you a treat. We won't be found wanting. Deal? Give me five, Kolya! A suitcase is a big deal. Without a suitcase man is like a tree. Always in the same spot. I'll give you my suitcase as a present. Alright then. Now a suitcase is in the bag. Half the work is done. Alright, now... What is it we wanted to do? Don't you remember? Not really. You know better. I'll get it. Where do you think you're going? Who called you? There's not enough space as it is. Those people! Do come in. Come in, have a seat. So you're leaving? I am. And where do you think you're going? Sod off! Stop! Come here. Do you have a world map? What? A world map, that's what. I think so. Which one? A physical or a political one? Doesn't matter. Go fetch it. I don't even have anything to offer you. What are you doing? Stop that! You needn't! Alright. Come on, granny. I told you not to! Here! Handiwork. Resignation letter. "I would like to inform you that I am resigning from my position." Is anything wrong? You know better. Write then, "I am resigning." Date: 23th. And signature. Alright. Good. First, vacation, and then resignation. So don't worry. There won't be anything to pick on. And I'll send you the documents right away. That's it. Here, Fedya! That's what I wanted. Bring it here! Ladies and gentlemen! I have a toast! Quiet! Dear friends! Just look here. There are all kinds of things. Water, land. Oceans. The Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian. Here's Africa, and America, Europe. And of this whole white world, right here... Look, right here, right now, is our Kolya. In flesh. Here is our Kolya. And around him are all of us. But some time will pass, and our Kolya won't be here any more. He will be right there. And the distance between us will be like this. But in real life like that. So let's drink for what I've just said. For scale! Let Kolya speak. I give floor to my friend. Our dear friend Kolya. Well, Kolya, tell us something, will you? Go ahead, Kolya. Come on, Kolya, go ahead. I heard you're leaving. Where? I see. What? What? Where's everybody going? We just started. Kolya! Can I have a seat? Of course, make yourself comfortable. At the table, in the armchair. Thank you. Fancy something? Although, there's nothing left. Thank you. Even better. Even better what? That there's nothing left. What do you mean? Everything. You're wrong. Are you stupid or something? May I come in? You may. This one? Yes, yes. You're wrong. Nothing's happened, nothing's changed. I'm talking about our relationship. Can't be. Even if I left, nothing would change in our relationship. Exactly. Whether you leave or not, nothing will change. Do you really think so? That's what you said. That's not what I meant. But I meant exactly that. Right. Nothing could ever work out for us. You told me that yourself. So maybe it's for the better that I leave. I'll feel calmer. I'll send you letters. Ok? Ok. If you have nothing else to do. There is something to do there. But I can always find 10 minutes. What's wrong with you? You have my adventure book. I haven't finished it yet. But you're leaving. On the window-sill. Take it quickly. Why don't you go with me? Nope. Why not? Because. Well, that sure explains everything. Still, think about it. The more the merrier. There's nothing to think about. Do you want me to stay? What for? Leave. Leave? Just like that? Just like that. Leave. Mind you, I will. Go ahead. I will. Go ahead. Well, nuts to you! These too. Excuse me. What's going on here? My God. Stop that at once! What's going on here? Nothing. Answer me! Stop that! Well? Own up! I'm leaving. I know. So what? To the Far East. I know. I invited her but she refused. She did the right thing. That's all. Why is she crying then? How should I know? She feels like crying. Ask her why she's crying. No. You explain to me why she's crying. I'm asking you nicely. Mind you. Or you'll feel like crying yourself. Tatyana Ivanovna. I explained to you, I don't know why she's crying! She told me to leave herself. And maybe I don't want to leave! I'm comfortable here. But I will leave! I'll leave to spite! I don't want to but I will! Don't shout! Don't you dare. Don't think that you can shout at me just because you're leaving. I'm not shouting. I'm just nervous. Here you are. I agree with you about the rest. It's right. What's right? That you're leaving. At least, you'll have something to do. Instead of just hanging around. Like a billy goat on a rope. You know no better than to whistle under the window. Who needs someone like you? Whistler. Mum! So no one needs me then. No one. If you leave, maybe you'll become someone. But we'll have to wait and see. I won't leave. And I won't become someone. I'll whistle like a billy goat on the rope. Whatever you do, you won't get rid of me! Stop fooling around. Are you leaving or what? I told you, I'm not leaving! How about clearing the table? Here you are. Selling out, are you? Selling out. And the room? I'll exchange it. But you wanted to stay. I do. How will you stay after selling all the furniture, and exchanging the room? Just like that. I'll live in the yard, under your window, on the suitcase. So that you see me every day, every minute! I'll be a thorn in your side. As you like. Let's go. You're a moron, Kolya. Oops. The island of Sulawesi. Fancy that! Incredible. I would have never come up with such a name. But they did. It's piece of cake for them. Let's find a place for you, shall we? Just a moment. You got right into the ocean. Let's see. Depth: 6 000 metres. Not a bloody thing around, just water. The nearest land is in... In a nutshell, you're doomed. You won't make it. Do you feel? Do you feel the Earth turning under your feet, together with your house, together with trees under the window, together with a dog pissing on the fence. No, wait. You're also turning around with it, not being able to stop. The globe is turning for you. At first fast, colours flickering. Then slower, looking sharp. Continents and oceans take turns. Rocking to sleep with the walleye of the pole, holding with the equator. And finally even slower, so that one can discern bays and peninsulas, islands and lakes. Yellows and greens of the land give place to blues of shallow water and ink blues of depths. Until the globe finally stops. And then your fixed look finds itself in front of a pale gray part of the globe where there are no citynames, no arteries of rivers, no other reference designation which reflects the surface of the Earth. There's nothing at all, except for a smooth pale gray colour, which became pale exactly because too much could be painted with this colour. Kolya! Kolya! Open the door. It's me, Fedya. Kolya! Kolya, are you there? Kolya, it's Fedya and I. Of course he's there, where else would he be? Kolya! It's Filip Makarych again. You hear? Answer! Kolya! What are you doing there? Kolya, open the door! We have to talk. Is he there? Maybe, he's already left. We'd better call Natalya. Where is she? Go fetch Natalya. Kolya! Maybe he's sleeping. Yeah, right. Kolya! We know you're there. Kolya! Are you sleeping? He's not sleeping! He's just been talking to me. Rather swearing at me. Kolya! Are you alone? Maybe, you're not alone? Maybe, there are two of you. Why two? Who with? Natalya is here. Come here. Kolya! Come on, talk. Kolya! It's me. Kolya, please, open the door. One more time. Kolya! Kolya! There's something I need to tell you. Kolya! I can see you! I saw him! Kolya, stop hiding, I saw you! Natalya, wait, where are you going? Kolya! Open the door! Where is Filomeyev? Call Filomeyev. Kolya! What are you doing in there? We can hear you. Long time no see! Well? Should I open the door? Here we go. Kolya! Can we come in? I am told Kolya locked himself and can't get out. It wasn't hard at all. Peace of cake! Kolya, what's wrong with you? Nothing. Why are you lying on the bed then? I wanted to rest before leaving. Why didn't you open? For that same reason. He said he wanted to rest. What are you all doing here? Outside! Only the closest ones can stay. What should we do? Don't you see? But we need to take things out. Don't you see he's lying on the bed? Take the chairs. That's better. Filip Makarych, you wanted something? Not really at the moment, no. Maybe, a bit later. You said you had something to do. It'll wait. Although Kolya, it seems, has been dissuaded. Yes, Kolya? So I thought. He got it at last. This is the most important thing. I don't take offence for the words. I do understand. So, Kolya, I'll come back a bit later. Ok? Because now I feel awkward. Mind you, Filip Makarych, the bus is leaving soon. What bus? Oh, I see. Thank you, I know. Excuse me. Kolya, I'll take this one. So then? Feeling refreshed? Yes. Don't get up. There's no hurry. You still have some time. Yes, Kolya, how quickly it all happened. Before you know it, the time has passed. And now you'll be leaving soon. Have you packed all you need? How should I know? Must be all. I put in the suitcase everything I could find. A shirt is at the top, easy to find. Shoes are in the right corner, I wrapped them in a newspaper. A jacket... As soon as you arrive, take it out at once, otherwise it'll be rumpled, not good for wearing. There's also a red coat, small stuff is at the bottom in a bag. What else... That's all, I guess. Alright. I'll be going. You'll manage by yourselves, without me. I don't like this sort of thing. You heard? He doesn't like. No one ever accompanied him, that's all. He has always been alone, that's why he doesn't like. Exaclty. He thinks since he gave a suitcase, now he can do anything he wants. If you don't like then don't even stick your nose. Kolya! Why was Filip Makarych hanging around here? I didn't know you were such close friends. Friends my ass. Always sermons. Kolya! You don't like something, is that it? I've been watching you, and you seem somewhat nasty today. Biting everyone. You shouldn't do that, Kolya. You're hurting us. I'm confused. Everything's mixed up. I got up on the wrong side. I don't know what I'm saying. Don't pay attention. It's my own fault, all what's happening now. I'm not resentful at all... I'm not picking on you. The other way round, I love you very much. I'm grateful for everything. Really. You know, I hadn't expected for it to turn out like this. Everyone came here at once, listening, asking. By the way, I composed a song. It's a pity, though. Now that everything is so good, I have to leave. Maybe I shouldn't. Maybe it's a bad idea. Maybe I'd better stay. Well, Kolya, of course you could stay. But I thought you were a serious person. Thank you, Kolya. I understand you. I really do. Forgive me, Kolya. I was unfair to you. Forgive me. Now I know, you're a real friend. For Fedya and for me, and for everybody. Only you shouldn't stay because of us. Because we all want what's best for you. If you stay because of us, we'll all feel guilty. Like we kept you here, so don't, Kolya. Don't. I have no objections. I just asked. And in this case... You're doing the right thing! Since you've decided, it's better not to turn back. Like that, it's a masculine way, our way. And there's no reason to wipe. Knock it off, Valentina! Kolya knows what to do. He's not like that. He won't back off. Can I come in, Kolya? Come in. Thank you. Please, meet comrade Saratov. He is from the downtown. Hello, comrades. Hello. Comrade Saratov is a head technician. Senior technician. Whatever. It's not your fault, after all. The main thing is that he's here. Kolya, I'd like to talk to you about a serious matter, in private, as they say. Does it have to be in private? And how! It's absolutely vital. We should go then. We'll wait in the yard. Kolya! Fyodor, move! We are not wanted here. Fedya! Valya! Alright, you can look around now. There's wallpaper, parquet floor, the window is alright. Let's air the room a bit. What a day! Seeing off, guests and just people... Coming, leaving, coming again... Don't worry it's so dirty here, I'll clean it up. Don't go to the trouble, I can clean up by myself. As you like, it's up to you. Actually, there's a little problem. I promised you a room with furniture. But, as you can see, there's no furniture any more. I can do without furniture. I don't really need anything special. There's a bed, it's quite enough. As you like, of course, but, actually, there's no bed either. Don't pay attention to it, it is still here temporarily, but in fact there's no bed. Although I can promise you a folding bed. And a cupboard to go with it. I don't need it anyway. Apart from that, everything's ok. Everything's fine. It's quiet here. Lavatory is in the corridor. The price is ok. Isn't it? It is. Do you agree? I agree. Everything's fine. I like it. Can I have a seat? I've been on the go all day. Everything's ok then? It's settled? Make yourself comfortable. I'll go fetch a folding bed. Kolya! Kolya! Why, why didn't you tell me? I'd have given it back to you at once. Swear to God! Someone, lend me a tenner till tomorrow! For Christ's sake! Kolya is leaving! Thank you. What for? For coming. Everybody's come, so have I. Everyone's so happy for you. I'm very happy too. Really? Yes. Maybe, there you'll find something you like. Besides, new people, new friends. New everything. I'm happy for you. Thank you. You made me happy too. How? By being happy. Then everything's ok. You don't seem very happy to me. Why? I am happy. Do you want me to make you sad? It's all a lie, don't you understand? No one invited me anywhere, I don't have any friend, I don't have anybody! You... you... Bus! Do write us, Kolya! Don't get lost! Where's the suitcase? Well, that's about it. Here, I'm giving it back. Remember, Kolya, we're even. Kolya! Don't forget to write me! I'll be waiting. Don't forget to write us, Kolya!
