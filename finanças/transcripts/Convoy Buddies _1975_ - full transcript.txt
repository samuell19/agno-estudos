Look! We lost them! Actually, they lost us! Look at this stuff! Shall we split it now? Are you crazy? Not here, come with me. Matteo stop! Here we are safe! Here, here it's fine. Please. What are you doing? Stand up, come on! I have no words. You wait. Which do you prefer, the left leg or the right one? Half for each, what is right is right. Eat it! A rubber chicken. I knew I could not trust you. Moron! Well, I can be wrong sometimes, no! You're not wrong sometimes you're always wrong! All right, it's true. Sometimes I'm always wrong. the shop was full of real chickens, and you stole the only rubber one! How much have you got in your pocket? How much do I have? Here it is. I don't not want to get rid of them, they're family memories! Can I keep them? Funny, Let's see what I have. We have our drivers licenses for trucks! You do nothing with them! No, I have an idea! This is the place for us. - What do you say? - I say that if to live, we have to start working, you've become crazy, goodbye! Wait up! But do you think I have degenerated to this point? Have faith. Have you got a lighter? Do you want to rent a driver's license? No all right! - Do you need a driver's license? - No. - I sell licenses. - What do you sell? Driver's license. Almost new, uncensored, clean. - And where do you find it? - No, I already have mine. Forget it. - Tax exempt license? - Listen to me! I prefer to eat a rubber chicken, rather than the slurry they do in jail, let's go! And let me work! Do you want to buy a license? Eh? I said, if you want to buy, do you want to buy a truck license? I have a tricycle. It went wrong eh? Hey, you! Come here. I am talking to you! To us? This is a job to do in a couple of days. But look, you misunderstood! We don't want to work. The last time we were offered it, it took us six months of vacation to recover from the shock. Yes, yes, no! He was operated three times because of work. Very well. Good thing he understood that. So here it is! Oh my God, I feel bad! The other 200 thousand on the way back, okay? All right, sir, yes! Documents. - Yes. - Where are you going stupid! He is not the police. Forgive him, he did not understand. Here, these are the documents. Semi-new, uncensored, clean licenses. Shut up! The truck is already loaded, in Via Del Boschetto, 38. - Clear? - Clear! But I have not explained anything yet! Exactly! It is about delivering the cargo to Marseilles. In Marseille? It is destiny, I was born in Marseilles! I spent the most carefree moments of my life! Better like that! Those who started with us did not stay there. If the business interests you, the load must be brought to Marseilles, in Rue Bazar, 29. Unload the truck, get your money, and return home with the first train. - Are you down? - We are! Well, now repeat. - We're! - No, repeat the instructions I gave you! Ah! We must bring the cargo to Marseilles, in Rue Bazar, 29. Very well. Rest assured it's all regular. Spray insecticide cans. Be careful though, no bumps because they are based on benzoic acid. - Clear? - Clear! Do you know this type of truck? So this is a Fiat 691, four axes, 220 horses, eight gears. four normal and four reduced. 320 litres tank, Elastic cabin, the theory lesson is over. But then you know it? No. Do not be stupid! And now let's move on to practice. I drive. Four axes, 691 horses! I only did the theory. And you aren't very practical. But, what are you doing! Take it easy, we only have those! The pole! - The pole! - I see it! But I did not tell you to take it off! I think I've heard a boast. What might have been? Ah nothing, just a bang! How sorry I am! What? That Mary is not here. By the way, You were supposed to get married! And then? We have postponed it for the moment. Mary, oh Mary! What a delicate woman, what a romantic character. Those are the women who drive me crazy! Who knows what she's doing now! The whore! That's what she's always been. Yes, it's true! But there's a whore and a whore! She is graduated. The day I asked her to marry me, do you know what she told me? No, thank you, I'm able to starve by myself! I never told you, when .. - Yes. - Yes, of that night that... Yes, you already told me at least a million times! It's as if I had slept with her too. Now stop. Ti?, ti?, ti? these horns are for you! This truck carries a load. Black cats are bad luck! It's better I drive, I'm not superstitious! Colleagues! Damn how many trucks we have! It's an important company, surpass it! It's true! They have got a dead lice on the cover, too! Say hello! Hello! Hello! Tell him something. Hey, sprayers? What do you want? He does not understand. You, sprayers, same lice! Dead! What are you saying, who is the lousy? Hey? Are you going to France as well? Do we go the same way? You too? You have to shout otherwise they do not hear you. Are you going to Marseille as well? Look, I can not hear the words, but I know the gestures! To your sister! No! You did not understand! What? You didn't understand! You're deaf! Faggot to me? Go to hell! Son of a bitch! Asshole! Bastard! Watch out, quick kill them! Come on, let them see that we're not afraid of anyone! Kill them, kill them! I'll show him a lesson! You're an asshole! - Who? - Both! Go the hell! Get the underwear off, I can't see! How nice it is, to go 500! I enjoy.. Saint Gennaro! What are you looking at? You, what are you doing! Bastards! Move! Let me breathe! Get off, criminal! You made me a meatball! Bastards! Too bad she's not here with us! she would have enjoyed herself so much! - What a grace, a sweetheart. - Who are you talking about? What eyes, what a mouth! - What balls! - So feline! A panther! Who Mary? No, a police panther! Speed up, they are reaching us! Speed up? Make up an excuse, come on! Come on! Now, they go in front and block us! I understood. For the chicken you stole, thank goodness it wasn't me. Listen, how much will they give me for a rubber chicken? Well, I do not know. Anyway, look, it's better than you confess. Say you were broke, you were starving. You did it because you were hungry. Why, does one steal a chicken because he's thirsty? They are going away! They are going away! You were scared eh! You pee in your pants, say it! And stop it! Of course I was scared, weren't you? Rather, will they stop us at the border? And why would they stop us? We are two honest workers, two decent people. The load is in order, right? So if they stop us, they will not do anything! Who is it? Good morning sir, everything regular. He is him and I am me, here! Good morning! Of course if you want to check you can come with me. Come. It's a normal lice spray load. Watch the lice is dead! We work for the disinfestation of France. I demand that you search all things. Simone open the door. Here sir, games are made. You can search! But does this man understand French? Sir, I am joking, go up. Please please. Give the captain a hand and something! Come in! I am coming up, too! Come on, let's go, please look! look how wonderful, how extraordinary sir! What's up? Do not make that face sir if you want, we can open the boxes, so you can see that they contain lice spray. In Italy it is a product that has impressed, it is fulminating, dangerous for children. In Italy it is very used! Look! It is formidable! The cans sprays deadly liquid, and then for lice it's over! What is that? It's good? Baby doll, not a can. I said baby doll, right? The peeing doll. Three pigs! The perfumed pee. Pee! - Perfume? - And stop it! Laugh Laugh! You Italians are always joking! Goodbye General! Checkpoint one, they have now passed through the border. You like the life of the trucker, eh? Yes, the police that respects us and money on the go, go! He got scared! He must have taken you for Al Capone! Do you want to commit suicide? Wait a moment. Go to hell, you, your father, your mother, your sister, and that wretched who gave you the license! He's from here, he must know me! He talked about my father, my mother and even my sister. The world is really small! Look, he's losing altitude! Great, you hit it! Of course, Lieutenant Callaghan, fourth anti-aircraft battery! All the fleet has been knocked down! Checkpoint two, they have passed now. Everything is OK. Simone? After all those curves, it comes out zig zag-ish. Your bag or your life! Do not be stupid, come on! Turn slowly with your hands up. Come on. Give me the money. The money! Make a false move and I'll kill you. Hey! Are you crying? Look, I was joking! Here, keep the gun. And I know you were joking. Give me back the money! All right, keep it. Here. Stop pale face or you're dead! I give up, I give up! - Do you give up? - Yes. So keep it. I looked for you all over Minnesota Colt! And now you will not escape me. Of course, you got a gun! Hold on! Goodbye Ringo, I do not want to kill you, once we were friends, take it! And here I need the horse! Stop! Stop or shoot! Do you know I was afraid I had caught you? No. You were afraid of having to change the wheels by yourself. Established contact. Go back to the base, from now on I'll take care of them. Guys, we are up. There's one following us for half an hour, he hasn't got the courage to overtake us. Yes, but it's not that I'm afraid, you know? It is that we are a polite people. We are civil people, us French. Have I ever told you that I was born in Marseille? Yes, you told me a hundred million times! You have not told me anything since we left. Come on! Come on, please go on! Mr. French, please! See? It's true civilization! If we tell it around, they will not believe it. It is true! But you imagine an Italian driver that before passing, wait for the invitation? It does not exist! Remember that the boss absolutely wants the load of that truck! They are coming, hurry, wear the socks! You drive well on the straight roads! This is nothing, hold on tight. There is a curve! Watch out boys! I'm ready, boss! Ready! Ready! Careful Simone! Turn! But what were those people doing in the middle of the road? Maybe they needed help! And you stop like that, in the middle of the road? They must be Italians! In the car! - Yes, yes. - In the car I said! Damned fools! Something wrong with you? Nothing. I just amputated my pinky finger Go Go! If you have to sleep, here is the pillow, but I drive. Funny! No, wait, prudence is never too much. First we stop and then change place. Ugh! Come on, hurry, someone can come up - But who do you want to come? - I do not know, anyway, hurry. Turn, turn, turn! Brake, you moron! I can not stop it! I see. Hey, did not you hear a bang? Not me. - And you? - me neither. Damn! Here they are! Stop! Stop! It's not right! Come on, chase them! Hurry up idiot, move from here! It is not starting, we are stopped. I saw that, hurry! Speed up! Speed up now! Come on, come on! He can not do it! It must do it. - Come on! - It can not do it! Push. Get off the car! Push, push. Let's push, let's push! Forward, push, push! Forward. Come on, push, push! Move! Push, obey! Yes. Go! A moment, a moment! Careful! - What are you waiting for? - Yes. Overtaken. Move away idiot! If he could see us, Fr? Fr?! He would be proud of us. But will he see us again? Look at this wretch! - Let's see if he let me pass! - Hit it! Hit it! Here they are! This time they will not run away! And come on the red! Drive. But, the traffic light is red! And you pass the same! Idiot, but what do you do, you pass with red? You said that! Hey, slow down! Wait boss, we're here too! Boss, we are here, what do we do? Shut up and sit down. - Hey Simone? - What's up? Have you noticed that since we are in France, we have not even seen an accident? It's true! Candles stopped working! Walk! Damn you! If we let them escape, the plan is fucked! They will not escape boss, I keep myself at a distance so as not to make them suspicious. Them suspicious! Remember that we are dealing with two idiots. This time they will not run away! Those weapons, must be ours! And if we can not get hold of it, I will not go back to Fr? Fr?. Push, snail, with this pedal! Which pedal, that's my foot! Come on, move, push! A red light came on, what is wrong? We are out of fuel! Full speed ahead! Actually, two wheels are missing. You go ahead anyway! - Hey Simone! - What's up? Have you noticed that since we are in France, we have not seen a train? It's true! Here they are, do you see them? Speed up, it's over for those two! We are stuck boss! - But why did you stop? - Move! Push! - Speed up, speed up - I did, boss. Push! Go on, push yourself too! I push, I push! - Boss, it's speeding up! - But it isn't! - It will be a direct, better leave! - Who gave you the license! Who's going to tell it to Fr? Fr?? Let's count! Operations like these, men and means are lost! Better means! Shut up! There they are! Let's follow them! But how, on foot? Yes, on foot! If there is no other way! Come on, run! Take them, go ahead! Halt! - And now boss? - I'll handle that. No, no no! Do not get angry. Do not do that. He's sorry, poor man, take the handkerchief. - Thank you. - It happens. Disgusting though! - What's up? - He's thinking. Nothing is lost! And that is? - Let me wing! - What does it mean? What's up? - He's stopping it. - I understood. It's nothing boss! Insist boss. Boss, repeat wing? I have to be more determined. Halt! Halt! I said halt! You know what? Working this way, honestly is not heavy. Plus it has its advantages! What advantages? Here we become rich! Even one trip a week, it's about a million a month! That is, 12 million a year. Quite right. In short, with a little sacrifice, and overtime in two years time, we go retired! And I marry Mary. So you have horns too! Well, I have them now too, but how could I live without a woman like Mary next to me! And here you are wrong! Your life must change, you have to make a family, have children, a dignified existence. An honest job, you already have it. Even Mary can give me children! Yes, sons of a bitch! See how beautiful France is! Here they are! I see them, boss. Come on, hurry, let's reach them! Yes, immediately! But why are you going back idiot! - Overtake it! - But I can not! Surpass! Help! Here they are, boss. They are very smart it will not be easy to take away the weapons. It will be a piece of cake. Block them, I have to tell them two little words. Yes, I have to tell them two, too. Shut up asshole and drive! - Did you hear what the boss said? - I heard, I shut up, asshole and drive. - But look at this! - What happened? They did it on purpose! They saw you in the face and thought they can fuck with you cowards! Me? Yes you, but they do not know that I'm here too! So go, let's show them who they are dealing with! Nobody fucks with me, go go! The safety distance! That's crazy! Calm, calm guys! Speed up! Speed up! - The boss does not want to! - They are pushing us! - he does not want to? - Speed up! Do something! He touched us! He did it on purpose! - He did it on purpose! - He did it on purpose! We are hooked! Pretend it's nothing. I know, they have not heard, now I'll tell them better. Hey you, nice life, uh saving on gas! Turn off the engine and stick to the horns, So you always go straight! You saw those four idiots, they were so surprised! Here, so you learn! Boss, they keep pushing us! What do I do? - Boss? - Here we are. They fell into the trap! They? I saw you! Just think about driving! - I just think about driving! - The plan is perfect! Speed up, idiot! They took your bumper away and you let them go, without them paying the damages? Listen, they took it away from you too! But it is you who's driving! Do you think I risk the cargo on four French fools? - I do not care! "Not me, you're going after him now." All right, now I'll show them. You have to pay me the damages! That's the car! They're over there! Damn pirates of the road! Leave them to me, eh! Leave them to me! Please. I got you, ugly son of .. What are you doing, son? Excuse me so much father. Did you repent, I see that the Lord is with you. He says you stay with me. How do you know? I don't know! Hey you? Ti?! - This time he told you. - No, no to you! - Go Go! - To me? At the risk of blowing up all the sprays I will catch them! That's right! Are you sure, that this time too they were talking to me? Of course, I do not have horns! Right. - I can not take it anymore, I have to go .. - Do it, idiot! They are about to fall into the trap. Keep this distance. Slow down Insist, do not give up, go, go, go! - I'm going! - Go!

Good morning sir, we were looking for some people who, who, who had us .. In short, We entered here because, - You explain, it's better. - Yes, yes! We practically, as we came from the street, Gentlemen, you have arrived! This load is for me. So this is Rue Bazar 29! Precisely. Did you see, eh? And then we'll unload! - Sure. - Sure! - Let's unload it! Immediately. What are you waiting for, courage! But, this is not Rue Bazar! But yes it is. No, no, no, no, no, it's Rue Lagrange! Yes, and we do not unload. No. - I'm sorry. - Not me. But what do they want? Sprays. What? The sprays! Sorry Matteo, but who cares? It's not our stuff, eh? Quite right? _ Quite right! - Well! Stop. - Now what are they doing? - I do not know. - What do they want? - Money! Money? And no, that no! Take this. Hands up. Throw the gun. And now I'll fill you with lead! But that's water! And what do you think you are doing? I'll sprinkle you! No, no! One moment. Stop. I'm warming up! I am pleased. And now what will you take off? - Hurt? - No, wait. - Now? - Yes! - See? Hello? The man in the black dress? Ah, he's going up, yes, yes, yes! Now I will... Does he have a black hat? Yes, a nice red tie? - It's for you. - Thank you. He arrived! They wanted to steal the money! They could be satisfied with the load, right? Stop! You have settled the matter without Fr? Fr?. Have you had a good time guys? We didn't get bored! Well, I'm enjoying myself a little now. Stop! Do not try. And now, unload the truck! Move! No, no! No, the underwear no! You dared to touch Fr? Fr?, now I'll come up. Close up, there is a little breeze! Listen, what the hell is this? I do not know, reopen and ask him. What? I said I do not know, he's there, ask him! Yes, yes. May I help you? Disappeared. Look, I've been thinking about it, if all the trips have to be like this, I'll quit immediately. - Right? - Quite right. - Come on.- But not before getting the 200 thousand that belong to us! Hey! Give them a souvenir! But why are they so eager to get these insecticides? I have a feeling there must be something not legal, unclear. It is true, they must have lice! No, no I said dirty. Well, dirtier than lice! What did you understand! Something shady! Something like, smuggling goods! It's true you're right! The sooner we unload, the better. But where the hell is Rue Bazar? You know it do not you? You were born here! Of course I know it. Only, the city has changed a lot. Wait, wait let me orientate. So this is the port. I see it is the port. No, because it seems to me that the sea did not reach us here. You'll understand, here there were few houses. Oh, look! Pharmacy! A friend of mine lived nearby. - A whore! - Natural! Yes, of course it has changed but it is always, my old and dear Marseilles. The city that inspired our national anthem. The national anthem? - La Marseillaise.- Ah, the Marseillaise! Well, it was a girl from here, she worked on the other side of the city. - What bridge? - The Segimo bridge. Hi! - Who did you say hello? - That one is an old friend! Yes, but sorry, - Rue de Bazar. - What is Rue de Bazar? The road where we have to deliver the load, right? Ah, wait a minute, let me orientate, right? So, That's the tax office, and over there, there is the great cathedral. What's its name? San Simone, where they baptized me! And this is the famous Zi Teresa restaurant. - But isn't it in Naples? - It's a branch! And then here. We returned to the port. Sorry Simone but, did not you say you were born in Marseille and that you knew it as your pockets? Yes, but I told you, the city has changed! They moved everything! If I knew it, I would bring the map! But tell me, when did you leave, eh? About 30 years ago, I was six months old. But I was a precocious boy! What an idiot! You moron! Come on, turn left! Yes! Turn right, turn left Go straight and get to Rue Bazar. Of course, here it is! So lucky! Rue Bazar, the spray cans have arrived! Hey! We arrived! We made it! Come and unload, come on! Hey home, it's us! So, the spray cans arrived, women! But how is it possible, they made us suffer so much for this load that everyone wanted and now the masters, do not show themselves! Crazy! It took us forever to get here! Come on walk! Look! Yes, let's go, there's a meeting. Boxing! Wait a moment. Shall we go up? Sure! No, no mercy! I kill you imbecile! Idiot, moron! You wanted to do it on your own! You should have consulted us first! But now you pay for it, I'll kill you, I'll kill you! Stop. He has to recover that load, I give you 24 hours of time. Here the meeting goes for long, let's go! And now go! Seen like this he looks like a knee. No, no he is the one! Hi boss! Need a hand? But how, you are here, you have arrived! It's really you! Of course it's us, who should be? God bless you! - Are you still here, worm? - It's them, it's them! And no, break! Boss, Mr. Lerenar, you see! What was I saying to you! I had an intuition, I have a good nose, they arrived, they did it! - Hello! - Hello. Ah, it's you! How are you? So it's not true that you died in that garage! No, no! Right! And the load? It's here, in the truck. Yes, but who do you think you're kidding? Be good, breathe with your mouth. Lerenar, the truck is out here, everything is loaded! Idiot! Did you see that I was right? Boss, I told you I was right! Good, good. Of course there must be a big competition in the spray business! There's something not very clean here, be careful! Here, look, in the truck we found a gun. This is your money. And now disappear. Return to Italy immediately. We do not know each other. Is it clear? - Very clear. - Ultra clear! We deliver the cargo and lose the job. Nice gratitude! Yes, yes, but for me they'll get into trouble. More than warning them, what could we do, no? Sorry, since you're from here, where is the station? What? Do not you want a ride? Well, if you really insist then, take us to the station! By the way, I apologize for the rough welcome, we were all a bit nervous. And then Mr. Lerenar is always a little suspicious of strangers. But you made a very good impression, he has a great opinion of you! Yes, a great opinion and then he dismisses us. But no! Indeed in confidence, he has another job to entrust you! Great! Well, compatibly with our commitments, right? Quite right. We reserved you a room in that hotel Tomorrow Mr.Lerenar will explain to you what it is. And by the way, get yourself some decent clothes. We always deal with high-class customers! Long live France! Listen, will these clothes be right? Of course, important people in Marseille dress like that! Hey, tell the truth, do not I look like Borsalino, eh? - And I? - Borsalino and C. - You are C. - No, I'm Borsalino and you're C. What are you doing? Stand up! - Simone? - What's wrong? Is it true that there were spray cans in the truck? Well, what else could there be then? And what do I know, smuggled cigarettes, marijuana, secret documents, war plans, spaceships. And maybe even atomic bombs, Next time, we check the load first. - I believe you! - We're not two fools! Only two idiots like those, can accept to bring another load! It's lucky to have them! Right now, we've had this big order! Of course, they do not ask questions and they hit hard! They are ideal, this time we would have to give up. It is a load that everyone has already rejected. People care about their skin! These two won't bring their skin home this time! We were a very good group! All of Marseille was afraid of us! To be fooled like that, from those two! Let's rip their eyes out! Yes, we must immediately take revenge! Sure! This morning, even my grandfather spat in my face! Better spitting, than the anger of Fr? Fr?. The order is mandatory. He said the matter is closed! The boss wanted the weapons, not the skin of those two Italians, don't you dare taking initiative. Clear? Clear? Yes. But as a leader, after they have reduced you like that! How can you obey! Do not you feel your blood boiling, too? Fr? Fr? said to forgive! It's not my fault. It was him he was! Anyway, the best forgiveness has always been revenge. And here, touch here! It is full! Good morning everyone! Here we are in France. So? Maybe it's because I have a bad pronunciation? Dear, I felt it, I felt it! I've finally found you, come here beautiful come! What are you doing here in Marseille? Did you know that I came here eh! You would follow me to the end of the world! Honey, you always love me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me! A little kiss! My darling, how beautiful you are! Shall we do a quick one? Yes! You always say yes. May I? Please! You understand now? - He started. - I don't accept these jokes. So another time, you'll think about it. Did he hurt you? He surprised me, it's nothing. Then. I slipped but it's nothing. - So what are you doing? - Now I'll kill him. Then. But do you know him? Very well! - And he always hits like that? - Always! Get him guys! Did he hurt you? Sir? Can I offer you something! Stop! Where are you going! They are already many! Very good! Do you want some? Do you like? Take it! Taste this! Swallow it! So? Sorry. Right, left, right. Beware of the knife! One moment! Stop! I'll handle that. It was him! I am the law, you understand, I am the law! And the law is above everything! Well! More above than that! Stop, do not move! No, it's not me it's him! - It's him? - It's him. Destroy them! Animals what are you doing? Goodbye world! No, glasses no! It's a mom's gift, please! Very good! Who is that? Who is it?! It's her! My darling, you have not changed at all, always ready to fight for me! But you're a little changed, but you're more beautiful with red hair! I've always been red, you look much better with a beard, do you know honey? But me, I've always had a beard! Oh yes? Oh, Mary! Oh, Bobby! But me, my name is not Bobby! My name is not Mary! But then.. It's not us! What a pity! What a pity! What a pity! What a pity! What balls! What's your name? My name is Rosy and you? Simone. Oh Rosy, Rosy, why have I let you go! First Mary, now Rosy! Please sir. Rosy, Rosy where are you, Rosy! Please sir. What will I do without you? You're the woman I've always dreamed of! I'll introduce you to mum, I'll marry you. Please do not start again! She even mistook you for somebody else! Yes, yes but she likes me, I feel it, I feel it, but I've got it all wrong. It's the only time you've done the right thing! Why have I let you go like this! What will you do now, alone defenceless. Exposed to the thousand dangers of the road. But what dangers! The street is her home! Well, now it's enough! Come on, do you trust me? Has Matteo ever left you in these moments? - Yes. - So! Now you will see, that your Matteo will fix everything! Now you throw yourself on the bed, and take a nap! Man, he always gets stuck with a woman! Rosy, Rosy, Rosy, Rosy! Are you hurt? Me? No. And why are you complaining? I am not complaining. I told you to take a nap, and see what you did? He must be called Mr. Nap! Will it be charged? Hello? Yes? There is a thief under the bed. - Help! - My bed! Ready doctor! - Serious case? - Yes. He has his chest in place of his back, he must be plastered immediately! - But it's already in plaster! - Away! I'll be back later for the report. You see it? Now they will say that it was me! Go..to...hell! - Can we go? - No. - Why? - We got a flat tire! Damn! He's got bad luck! Well, let's change the wheel. Oh Rosy, Rosy! Come on, be good, be good! Now I'll teach you a system to forget her! You must repeat with me, come on, Rosy disgusts me. - Rosy disgusts me. - Not me! I know, but you have to repeat it until you convince yourself! Rosy disgusts me, here Rosy disgusts me. Very good, Rosy disgusts me. Rosy disgusts me. Disgusting, disgusting. Rosy disgusts me. Rosy disgusts me. God Rosy is really disgusting! Very good, you see it, it already begins to take effect. Rosy disgusts me, Rosy disgusts me. I feel you're intimately impressed! - But do you know that Rosy really disgusts me? - Sure! I told you this is an infallible system! Rosy disgusts me. Look, you've already healed! Next time you meet Rosy, I'll marry her! - No come on! - Yes! And if she does not want me, I throw myself out of the window! - What are you doing? - I throw myself out of the window! - Come here! - I love her, I love her! I want to die, Rosy, Rosy! - Now that the treatment was starting to take effect! - Rosy, Rosy. But who is Rosy! Can you hear me? Hey, help! Help! but what are you doing there? Come on come on! The leg! Help! Help! Help, hurry! There's another one! A doctor! He shot me, he shot me! Come to me, this is crazy! Mum mum! But you look! That became smaller, the other one is hurt, this is a dangerous hotel, that's the door! Taxi! Taxi, finally safe! What are they doing in that hotel, breaking them? Help, oh God, oh my God. Help. We are tight. This taxi, I saw it first. They will want to be paid in lire, do not be a fool, Lerenar!! Today it's not easy to find two men that risk their skin for a little money! Get them to come up! Hey! You two, the boss is waiting for you! Hello. Greetings to the whole company! Hello. Here we are. If any of you, thinks we're two morons, he's wrong. Right Matteo? Exactly. The conditions are these: for less than... Do not overdo it! Let's five. Six million is still a bargain it is better to give up! All right. We want 500 thousand lire. Not a penny less. 450 and we will no longer speak of it. Agreed! Listen up you, let's pretend that the other load was sprays, but this time, tell the truth, or the deal is over! Ok? So what is it? It is only oil, seed oil, Can I? Please! Seed oil, eh? Check Simone! How is it? Peanut. Done deal. Since you found them, in your opinion, those two, are they for real or do they pretend to be like that? I can not do it, I'm seasick. What do you think, it hurts only you? I am suffering very much. - I feel nauseous. - Yes! Then, how can you eat? There is an infallible system you have to repeat, I do not suffer from seasickness! All right, I do not suffer from seasickness. Here, very good, go on. - I do not suffer from seasickness. - I do not suffer from seasickness. - Good good! - I do not suffer from seasickness. I invented this system, it does not work! - It works. - I am seasick. - Keep going! - I do not suffer from seasickness. I do not suffer from seasickness. Keep going! It's going to take effect, go! Seasickness. - I do not suffer from seasickness. - I do not suffer from seasickness. So so! I have never suffered the sea. Go, go good! Up to this point. Think of the long wave. Up and down! Simone do something, stop this sea! - Stop the sea! - I kill myself! I'm not Moses! I do not suffer from seasickness. Go Go! I think of the long wave. So! - I do not suffer... - Do not disunite, continue! There! Simone is over! What did I tell you? - I'm going to throw up! - Here! Your aperitif. Thank you. Rosy! Simone! You here? I'm here! This time it's us! Do not revive what was the past! I'm always your treasure! My love is you! And who will let you go! - Where are you taking me? - In our love nest, so that it may be consumed, the passion that overwhelms us. No, no, no wait! Wait up! Let me get comfortable! Get yourself as you wish! Simone turn around! Yes, I turn around! What's up, are you on hot coals? No, we're on Santa Barbara! And who is this Barbara, I do not understand? Please, go away then I'll explain, get out, get out, run away! You ugly coward! You make me sick, you disgust me! Did you understand? They said seed oil! - Those are weapons! - Can you swim? - No. - So we're trapped! Now we are forced to arrive in Africa. But as soon as we land in Dakar, we deliver the cargo to the authorities. And as soon as we deliver it, those cut off our heads, those do not joke, but it would be nothing to die, if before I could get satisfaction, to have Lerenar in my hands !! - I know! - I'm telling you! Here something must be done! What? - Throw the load overboard! - But how! - Come on, I have a plan. - Well! Damned, it is closed. But did not you have a plan? - I have a plan, not the key! - And now who's breaking it! - Do as usual, even or odd? - Even! One two three! Five. You cheated I saw you! Do you think I break a friendship to win even and odd? Okay, so I always have to sacrifice myself! In short, I say, if you do not serve at this any more, this is the end! Who's behind there? Ah, I was looking for you, the Captain wants to see you. Please follow me to his cabin. Look, I can testify, he did nothing I swear! We did some gymnastics, we'll get stiff by sitting down all the time. Do not worry it's just a formality. Please come to this side. He said this way, he also said please. - He said it to me. - Then he meant you! We confess everything, it is always better one of the navy, than one of the police! Slow down, let me get some information first. Pardon me Admiral, a question, if my friend confesses everything, how much does he save of prison? I do not understand. - If we confess! - Yes, all right! You will explain everything to the Captain, this way please. Here we are. It can not be! Of course he looks like him! No, it's not good, boys! Not at all. This was not our agreement! Instead of delivering the cargo to the destination, you wanted to throw it to the sea! It was him! I'll take care of it, cover my back. Listen up, friend, in Dakar, we had to deliver seed oil, and not guns and machine guns! Move away, kid! Ah, there's the lice meeting! Stop! Stupid idiots! What are you waiting for? I want them alive! - Let's split up! - Yes! They mustn't have gone far! You, on that side with two men, you two that way, and keep your eyes open! Five others go that way, two above and three below! I want them alive! And you, and no, you better stay here I prefer to keep you in reserve! Ok! There he is! Here! One, two, one, two, one two. One, two, one, two. Three four! - Stop! - I can not, I lose a ride! But, this is late! - The group has already passed! - And well? You're out of time! No sorry. And no! You do not see us like that, put it like that. - No, like that. - No! One two Three! Here he comes, close up! One moment! Busy! I said busy! Now it's free. I saw you! I found the monster! No, no no. Bastard, get out of here! - I'll call the Captain, go away! - No, do not disturb! Thanks, it's very kind of you! hi guys, let's go? Hey, this way! Sir? They want you! What are you doing? They have it with me, give me a hand! Do not push! Hey you, listen up! - The pants! - They're here! Attention, service communication, group one, move to bridge number two. Group two to stern side. The specialized personnel intervene promptly, as per the order established earlier. All the men in their seats, move! Passengers are asked not to interfere, this is a planned drill, for emergency cases. The specialized men, will have to simulate, an attack by the enemy, trying to seize the ship. Move to the bridge number two, from where it is assumed contact with the enemy will begin! What are you doing? I am eating, don't you see? I have the ship running after me and you eat? I follow the instructions. - What? - Here is written, emergency ration. Emergency ration? Well, more emergency than this, than I eat! Simone! Ah, yes, the kangaroo! My beloved queen how many steps will I have to take? Two kangaroo steps! One and two! One, two, one, two! One, two, one, two, one, two! One, two, one, two! Come on! My beloved queen, how many steps will I have to take Two steps as cod. Catch those two, I want them alive! Alive, I said! What a curse! Oh my god, how big it is! Hey! Throw yourself into the pool, he can not swim! Oh yes? Thank you. Hey!? How's the water? There isn't any. And you threw yourself? How dumb you are! So, are you all there? You look that way! Ah, your head! No, no, no! Oh my God, oh my God, my God! Who did it? That one! - Did he hurt you? - Yes. He is a brute. One moment. You're a tough goat, but this time you found one harder than you! - Come forward. - You come! And go! Well, it seems right. Go! Good boy! Good boy! And now we do the math. How much does a gun cost to Lerenar? 50 thousand. - And no! - No. 50 thousand are too cheap! I would say, 100 thousand! Do not be a fool. You're making a deal, we're selling you first quality weapons! Let me do it! So, 500 guns at 100 thousand each, Then there are 700 rifles, four field guns, 30 machine guns, seven mortars, so it sums up to, three by nine 27, four by two 32, seven by nine 63, then there is the percentage, the transport, the risks we have run, so, well! Lira more, lira less, are about 850 million. - Quite right? - Quite right. But those are more than 500 million! Ah yes, of course, of course he's right! Simone, give him the rest please Immediately. And with this, we're even! Do you also want the stamp? Documents. Sir please, come down! Well, they deserved it, right? Quite right. And we are also full of money! Police! Who will they look for? Us! But, but I can not swim! Learn! Matteo? How is it that I do not go to the bottom? Guess what! Simone? Our money! Money! - Simone! - Matteo! Matteo, why are we running away? Just run!
