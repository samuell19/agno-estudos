[instrumental music] [instrumental music] [music continues] [upbeat music] [music continues] Gee but it's great to be living Under western skies Taking whatever life's giving Under western skies Following trials to the sunset Where the rainbow lies Gee it's fun to live under The wonderful sun of the western skies To be or not to be living Under western skies Taking whatever life's giving Under western skies Out where the beautiful flowers And the stinkweed lies Gee it's fun to live under The wonderful sun of the western skies Gee it's fun to live under The wonderful sun Of the western Skies Pop, did you like it? Katie, your voice is getting prettier everyday. I wonder if they'll like me in New York. Sure they will. Folks in New York are no different than the ones we've been playing to in these tank towns. It's just that there's more of 'em. [chuckles] [dramatic music] [gunshots] Tally-ho! - King Carlos. - Who? The roughest, toughest hombre in the whole west. Give me the reins. [gunshots] [music continues] [gunshots] [gunshots continue] [intense music] [gunshots] Whoa. Hey, climb down. Climb down, all of you. [chuckles] Get down and hold your hands high. Get out or would you rather have me shot you out. No, I'll come down. Me smellum something. Must be actors or buffaloes. - Actors, huh? - What do you know about that? What's the matter with actors? Hoo-hoo! Right now I can't think of a thing. They never have a cent, that's what. Hey! Look, there are actors and actors. Our troupe's been playing to full houses ever since we left San Francisco. [chuckles] Daddy likes to boast a little. You see, business has really been awful. Oh, it's... [chuckles] [mumbles] It's just my joking. I'll soon find out. Carlos: You heard what the lady said. - Business has been awful. - What do you mean? We ain't gonna get anything out of this after all the hard work we've done? Oh, I don't know. A little entertainment might be relaxing. We open in Rim Rock tonight we'd be be glad to have you in the audience. Yeah, but I'm afraid Sheriff Wyatt of Rim Rock uh, wouldn't like to have us visit his town Why not, uh, make a few monkey shines here, huh[chuckles] - Here? Carlos: Why not? You couldn't ask for a more intelligent audience than my men. - Well, I... - Uh... [mumbles] - Ahh. [clears throat] - Ahem. I see what you mean. [mumbles] [both chuckle] Sure. Let me see, who's first? Willie: Neil - Uh... Huh? [sighs] Oh! Oh, I feel a little... Ahh... Ugh! There you go again. You've hit more roads than the overland stage. Come on, Neil, snap out of it. May I have the honorAhh. Is this a dagger which I see before me? The handle toward my hand? Come let me clutch thee. I have thee not and yet I see thee still. [screams] Oh, there's no such thing. It is the bloody business which informs-- Everyone into the coach! Red: Just a minute! Get your hands up and keep 'em up. And that's a very dangerous thing for you to do. We're not afraid of you. We're not just anybody you're holding up. Shh. Katie, Katie. Get into that coach, all of you. Get into that coach, I say. Man 1: Giddy up! Git up! Say, what's the idea lettin' them go? Oh, maybe, you're figuring on seeing that show in Rim Rock. Who knows. [horses galloping] So this is Rim Rock, eh? Well, it doesn't look any different than any other cow-catcher town we've played. Yeah, you should be glad you're alive to see this one. I thought for a while there those bandits would shoot us all up. [scoffs] They wouldn't dare. I was just getting mad enough to, uh-- To what? Well, to give them a piece of my mind - Yeah, that's what I thought. - [scoffs] Well. Could have put my name in bigger type. Remind me to speak to the manager. I... What's going on? What is thisUh... "Jim Wyatt. Jim Wyatt. Jim Wyatt." Never heard of him. Must be a medicine show. He ain't no actor, mister. He's our sheriff. YeahWhat did he ever do to rate such billing? Ooh, nothing much. Except clean up the whole town single handed. - You don't say? - Yes, sir. He's the greatest hero in this part of the state. And the best shot in the whole West. Why, he can split a blade of grass in a cow's mouth at a 100 yards. - See this? - Yeah. That's for getting Rip Conroy and his gang. - Hm. - See that one over there? That's for plugging Jim Henry out in front of the saloon. One shot and it was all over. This is for running King Carlos and his gang out of town. King Carlos? The toughest hombre in these parts. But he didn't scare Jim Wyatt none. He didn't scare us either. Say, I'd sure like to shake that sheriff by the hand. Well, it looks like you might be doing that right quick. I've peered down a 1000 gun barrels in my life but this is the first time I ever felt like turning tail. Sure you won't be changing your mind, Mrs. Simms. Not on your tintype. Sheriff, do your duty. Which one of you folks answers to the name of Willie Wells? Right here in the flesh, sheriff. And I am mighty proud to be meetin' up with you. Well, I reckon you won't be in a minute or so. I'm sorry, Mr. Wells, but the opera house won't be available to you What? The opera house's is civic property. The Rim Rock Women's Clubs successfully petitioned to have your show banned. Your name was on that petition, Hank. Well, I have to do what the missus says. But whyWhat's the matter with our show? [sighs] The last time a show like yours played here my husband ran away with a dyed blonde. But our shows isn't like that. If you'd care to see a rehearsal we-- Mrs. Simms: The matter is closed. Come along, Charity, Prudence. I'm sorry, folks. It's their opera house. I'm just plain hog-tied. Jim: Get out of there, you thieving rabbit. [gunshots] Looks like you're losing your aim, sheriff. Well, uh, I, uh... I didn't wanna hurt the poor little bunny I-- I, uh, I-- I thought he might be yours. Uh. [clears throat] Goodbye, Faith. Never knew Sheriff Wyatt had such a big heart. Or has he? [chuckles] Well, where do we go from hereHeh. That's alright, Rim Rock isn't the only town between here and New York. There's lots of other places that'd like to show our play. I still say we should've took off around the Horn. Where's the professor? - Go to it, Macbeth. - Huh? Moffat: Why does he suffer this rude knave? To know him about the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell me of his action of battery. HuhHa-ha. [barking] Macbeth found him alright. Wait here, pop. I will be right back. Katie, are you going in there alone? Why notThis is business. Well, what's this world coming to? My own daughter going into a place where they serve liquor. Please believe me, our shows different. Now, lookie here. That's what they said the last time. And what happened? The audience busted up all the glass wear in the Silver Dollar. No. Ain't taking no more chances. But surely people in Rim Rock like to see real entertainment just like they do every place else. Well, what's the matter with Maybelle here? The best bustle tossin' nightingale in the West. I'm sure she's very capable. But if you just let me give you an example of our show. Uh, do you know "Don't go making speeches?" [mellow music] Don't go making speeches Don't go singing songs Don't insist it's me alone To whom your affection belongs Don't say you'll cross rivers You might catch a cold All those words sound very sweet But dear they're so old Don't say you'll climb mountains They come awfully steep Don't go making foolish vows You might unable to keep So unnecessary Trying like you do You don't have to make Those speeches darling Just say I love you - There you are, miss. - Thank you. Ain't you afraid going out delivering those papers all by yourself? - Why should I be? - Why this is a wild country. And somebody's liable to get fresh. Might touch you ankle or somethin', who knows. And someone might lose one of their arms, who knows? Show folk sure ain't what they used to be. Argh! [Faith laughs] Faith, I'm surprised at you. That's no way for a young lady to act. I can't help it. I've never seen anybody get out of buckboard that way. - Uh, may I help you? - No, thank you. I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself. Well, I'm quite sure of that, but you might have a little difficulty repairing your buckboard. Buckboard? I, uh, believe that wheel does belong with the others. Oh. Uh... I don't wanna put you to too much trouble. But, well, I haven't had much experience with buckboards-- Oh, it's no trouble at all, I'll have it fixed in no time. A remarkable contribution to progress, the wheel. Few people realize the fact, but its invention practically marked the start of our civilization. That is civilization as we know it. You don't say. Uh, some scholars think that it started with the invention of the alphabet, but I don't agree with that school of thought. With the wheel came Travel and man began to learn new things. He discover new worlds. It broadened his view-point. I'm sure he did. He can't help talking that way. - He's a school teacher. - A school teacher? But don't let that bother you. He's very nice, really. Oh, I'm afraid Faith is just a little bit prejudiced. You see, I'm the only teacher in Rim Rock. I don't know how to show my appreciation, but if you and Faith would like to come to the Variety show tonight-- Gosh! I'd like to give you some passes. Oh, I'd like to see your show very much but I'm afraid it's impossible. - Why? - Well... After all, the town has entrusted the care of its youngsters into my hands and it's only natural that they should expect my conduct to be above reproach. What kind of a show do you think we're putting on? All we wanna do is make people laugh a little and cry a little, enjoy themselves. I'm not trying to moralize, or preach or anything like that, it's just that I-- Mr. High and Mighty School Teacher, so you said. With the wheel, man began to better himself, learn new things, discover new worlds, broadened his view-point. Why don't you go on and get yourself a wheel? What did I do? [sighs] You don't know much about women, do you? Good afternoon, Mr. Johnathan. Well, everyone in town knows about our show tonight. You know, Ms. Katie, I've been thinking it over and I've decided I'm plum teched letting you talk me into puttin' on this burlesque. It's no burlesque. I assure you our show will be a great success. [sighs] Now remember, no refreshments served during the performance tonight, as you agreed. but between acts, it's, uh, your privilege to invite the patrons to the bar. I'm sure you'll double your business. Oh, alright, but I think I'll see my doctor and tell him I'm crazy. [chuckles] Oh, pop. Oh, this no time to bother me, Katie. I'm trying to get this darned old machine fixed. Whoever call this a magic lamp must have been loco. - How do? - How do you do? My name's Mayfield. I'm the mayor of Rim Rock. - Huh? - Yeah Uh, who's a proprietor of this here Turkey here? - Uh... Turkey? - Yeah. I am the impresario and this is no turkey! - This is a production. - Alright. Well, it don't make no difference what you call it. There's a little matter of a license to be taken care of here. LicenseOh, yes, yes, yes, yes. The dog. Dogs are not in my department. - No? - No. It'll cost you folks exactly $100 if you want to perform here in Rim Rock. A $100? A hold up, that's what it is! Hey, now listen here, young lady. You ain't got the proper respect. I represent the law here! And unless you folks pay up the $100 you might just as well move on. - Ahh. - Ahem. Of course we...we might come to some little arrangement, I mean just between the three of us. So, you're still up to your old shenanigans, eh, Dave? Eh, well, now don't get riled, Jim. Why, I was just explaining to the folks here [clears throat], the Rim Rock law. That's all. That law ain't been on the books in years and you know it. [Dave clears throat] I'm giving you fair warning, Dave, if you get mixed up in anything that even the smell shady this town'll give me a new plaque, and a mighty small one for getting rid of a mighty small weasel. [chuckles] Oh, that-- that's fine. I... [clears throat] Well, I... Guess I'd better be getting along I've, [clears throat], got some business to take care of. Now... Oh, now, now, don't get no worried, Jim, no. It's-- it's got nothing to do with the law. [sniffs] [clears throat] Well, folks, [clears throat] welcome to the Rim Rock. Bye. Well, guess that took care that. Well, I guess we must had you all wrong when we first met you Mr. Wyatt. I hope you like our performance, sheriff. You're coming, of course? Oh, I reckon I'll like it fine. I'm kind of an easy mark. But this town is kind of fussy. If they don't like a performance, they got a heap of ways of showin' it. I know, but you can take care of that. You know, just like you did with the mayor, hm? Well, I can keep law and order. But you just can't go around steppin' on people's high spirits. Get them all riled up the wrong way. - Then they really get ornery. - Ah. Then I gotta start using these. [blabbers] Please. Thank you. [clears throat] [instrumental music] - How many? - Uh, one please. In the back. [indistinct chatter] [music continues] Man 2: Hello, professor. Hiya, Mr. Schoolteacher. What's the lesson for tonight? Look out for those purty girls. They're liable to keep you after school. [laughter] The town's having fun With the school teacher. - The who? - The school teacher. Let me see. [laughter] Well, what do you know. Say, Katie, it's show time and I can't find Professor Moffat. What's the mater? What are you gonna do? Go to work Macbeth. [whistling] [music continues] Moffat: ...most discreet. [Macbeth barking] It is a fowl thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all company. [Macbeth barks] [barking continues] Farewell, my cus. What did that scarecrow call me? You got me. [sighs] Set 'em up, Charlie. Three Bourbons. How does it feel being on this side of the footlights, Maybelle? I'll tell you more about that later. Come on, Charlie. How about those drinks? Sorry, Maybelle, the show's about to start. We can't serve no liquor during the pre-formance. Oh, what a night. [crowd applauds] [instrumental music] [tap dancing] [crowd laughing] [laughter continues] [music continues] [laughter] [laughter] [tap dancing] [laughter] [laughter] [music continues] [laughter] [laughter continues] [music continues] [laughter] [blows raspberries] [laughter] [music continues] [laughter] [music continues] [laughter] [music continues] [crowd applauds] Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please. I take great pleasure in introducing to you a voice, oh, and what a voice. The sensation of the Barbary Coast none other than the one and only Neil Mathews. - Boo. - You have him. - We don't want him. - Uh-- uh, huh? You want to see some real talent, we'll show it to you. Go on, Maybelle get up there. No, wait a moment, the performance isn't over yet. There's still more to come! You don't think we have any talent, eh? What's wrong with Rim Rock? Go ahead, Maybelle, don't let them bluff you. Man 3: We want Maybelle. Man 4: Yeah, we want Maybelle. Now, wait a minute. Listen, listen to me, just a minute-- Ladies and gentlemen. It gives me great pleasure to present a little lady you all know and love. Maybelle Watkins, the pride of Silver Dollar! [crowd cheering] [upbeat music] Gents cry out when I go by Oh you kid Tip their hats and wink their eye Oh you kid Don't think that I encourage them Of course I never did But still they say I love my wife but oh you kid I'm the belle of all the town Oh you kid In my new Parisian gown Oh you kid The girl of whom the other girls Would like to be well rid The men all say I love my wife but oh you kid? [cheering] What will you have next, folks? [scoffs] Some professional entertainment, that's what. Listen, dearie, I ain't no amateur. [laughter] [gasps] Man 5: Come on you had your turn. Let me at her, I'll scratch her eyes out. - Oh, give her a chance. - Who does she think she is. What do you wanna do, hog it all? [mellow music] An old fashioned girl Is lovely and sweet as the best are She's not coy as the rest are She's always loyal and true A new fashioned girl Is fickle as winds from the West are She'll leave your head in a whirl You'll come back To an old fashioned girl An old fashioned girl Is lovely and sweet as the best are She's not coy as the rest are She's always loyal and true A new fashioned girl Is fickle as winds... - Carlos? - Carlos. Carlos, we ran your kind out of Rim Rock and we don't want 'em back. That ain't no way to treat a visitor, Jim, after all these years. Go right ahead, don't let me interrupt your show. [indistinct chatter] What's the matter, Carlos? You hard of hearing. I'm giving you ten seconds to go through them swinging doors, and get out of Rim Rock. [gunshot] [clamoring] [upbeat music] Bust my glassware, will yaOh! You shouldn't do a thing like... If you gentlemen just quiet down and talk things over. I think, I think... [clamoring] [music continues] [clamoring continues] [laughs] [music continues] [clamoring continues] [upbeat music] [music continues] Ms. Wells! Ms. Wells! Ms. Wells! [clamoring] [girls screaming] [crashing] [instrumental music] Oh. Ms. WellsMs. Wells? Oh, now, I'm really in a pickle. I didn't mean to hit you so hard. Ms. Wells, you know, you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life. So, you wanna fight? I'll show you... Ms. Wells, Ms. Wells, Ms. Wells. We're not in the Silver Dollar any longer. The fight's over? Well, we weren't doing too good, so I didn't think it was wise to wait around and see. Wait, you just turn right around. We're going back. Nobody's gonna break up my act and get away with it. [groans] Who hit me? Well, people very often do strange things, things that they'd never do under ordinary circumstances. No. It couldn't be. [chuckles] You-- you're not angry? I think it's wonderful for you. Oh, you think I'm pretty stuffy, don't you? Well, after the way you acted this afternoon, I... Well, my job is very important to me. In this cow-catcher town? We're just using it as a way stop. We're headed for New York. Well, I'm afraid that theater and teaching are very different professions. Whatever you do, you've got to try for the top spot on the bill. You sounded like a pretty fine teacher this afternoon. You know, I bet nobody ever thought of those things you said about the wheel. You could probably get a job teaching in a big city. Oh, I wouldn't like that, I wanna stay here and teach where I'm really need. This part of the country is still young, it's gone through some pretty violent growing pains, gun battles, lawlessness, vigilantes. But somehow it's managed to weather all of 'em. Now, it's time for it to grow up, to be strong and healthy. I don't see what teaching and reading and writing has to do with being strong and healthy. Well, it has everything to do with it. If people learn to read and write, they think. And when they think, no one can put anything over on 'em. Not for very long. You know, what you say sounds like it's very important. Oh, it is important. To a very beautiful part of our country. [chuckles] I've been talking too much. [instrumental music] [church bell tolling] You still haven't explained satisfactory why you're wearing that court plaster. Well, it was a very unusual type of accident. Did everybody had the same unusual type of accident? I suggest you find a better explanation as to how. Well, I didn't want you to become upset. That's why I didn't tell you. You see, last night, King Carlos and his men came back to town and there was an awful brawl in the Silver Dollar. That's why they're guarding everything. Just what were you doing in the Silver Dollar? You had an invitation to my party if I my remember correctly. Well, it wasn't something I had planned. It was just one of those unpredictable... Carlos has been spotted near the Fuller place. There's no telling where he'll strike next. And remember, he ain't giving no warning like a rattler. Yeah, there wouldn't have been all this fuss today if Carlos had been took last night like he should've been. Yeah, I never had no chance to get near him. Ah, shucks, it seems to me, Jim, that you had plenty of chances. - Meaning what? - Oh, well, nothing. Except that sometimes a man just can't handle his job he, uh, just gets a little too old. Don't say that again! Oh, now, I didn't mean you, Jim. I was talking about, well, any old man. Don't scare so easy, Dave, or you'll never grow old. Ah, I was just trying to teach you to back up what you say. Come on, let's be going to the meeting. Yeah. I have one announcement to make. The annual church social will be held in the church parlors next Friday afternoon from 2:00 to 4:00. Everybody is cordially invited. Now, for the reading of the Scriptures. Book of Matthew, Chapter 19, 13th verse. Excuse me, Parson. I, I hate to interrupt. Last thing I want to be guilty of is sacrilege. But I want to warn every man to be on his guard. I know you can't carry your guns in here, but I, I want you to be able to get 'em fast. Well, just say the word, sheriff. We can put back the service a mite until this thing is settled. I'd take it as a blot on my record if the Lords' work was held up one minute for a man like King Carlos. I ain't afraid of him. And I know you ain't. Go right on reading books, Parson. Ah, Katie, haven't I always been a good father to you? Haven't I always done what you told me? What do you say we turn around and go right back? You didn't say anything about this when we first signed up with the troupe. No, it ain't in our contracts. There's no use talking. We're all going to church. Oh! No, look, Katie, I don't do much complaining but this is the darndest idea. It's important that we go. People have funny ideas about actors. They don't think we're respectable. Well, I don't care what they think. I am not going in this church. How about you, professor? Our ranks are broke, and ruin follows us. What council give you? Whither shall we fly? You're all gonna fly in this church, every last one of you. Except Macbeth. Parting is such sweet sorrow. Pastor: "Then were there brought unto Him little children. That he should put his hands on them and pray and the disciples rebukes Him. But Jesus said... Suffer little children And forbid them not to come unto me for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.." [clears throat] We're as popular here as a mule act. Shh! It might interest some of you folks know that the service is going on at the front of the church as usual. The congregation will now sing hymn number 51. [organ music] Out here in the West We sometimes forget To stop and to count Our blessings So maybe it would do All of us good To remember A cowboy's prayer One night on the range Before turning in This cowboy began His praying His pal name of Jim Says scornful to him What have you To be thankful for? For stars says he And air that's free For good green lands And friendly hands And plains a man Can ride on Says he that's why I Be saying this prayer As for Jim He just says Amen Amen That was a mighty fine rendering of that hymn, ma'am, and we thank you. Show folks don't come here as often as we'd like. Guess maybe we seem kind of standoffish, but we don't mean to be. In this church, everybody's welcome. Well, thanks a lot, Parson. We're not used to being so popular. Well, you won't get very far. The whole street's covered. Yes, so I noticed. We didn't come here to cause any trouble, and there won't be any unless... Parson: Then what did you come for? Carlos sends us to pick up Ms. Katie Wells. Just a moment. I don't see what all the fuss is about. I made an appointment with Mr. Carlos last night before the show. It just seems to sent an escort, that's all. Katie. [sighs] I don't know why everyone so shocked. Don't people in Rim Rock make appointments? I'll be back later, pop. Get 'em, Jim. Why, wh-- what's the matter? Why didn't you shoot? I was afraid of hitting the girl. Why, at that distance we could of shot the buttons off them bandits. Well, I just wasn't taking any chances. Well, I think it's Rim Rock that's taking the chance of keeping you on as sheriff. You've just outlived your job, that's all. Oh, maybe he's got a little touch of buck fever. Well, he never had before. I'm asking you for your badge, Jim Wyatt. We're electing a new sheriff tomorrow. There's no reason to go to all that trouble. If you want to get rid of Carlos all you have to do is get rid of that actress, that's why he's here. Yes, we haven't had a bit of trouble with Carlos' men until these show folks came to town Guess maybe we've never had anybody pretty enough around here to attract some attention. Well, what's all the bellowing? If you're going to stand out here we might just as well finish the service. We ain't taken up the collection yet. Aren't you staying for the service, Mr. Howell? Oh, I gotta get off some place alone. Where I can do some thinking. Mind if I tag along? She couldn't have wanted to go with King Carlos. It-- it doesn't seem possible. Of course not and pardon me for saying so, Mr. Howell, but as far as women are concerned, you don't know your P's and Q's. You don't even know your ABC. Aw, it appears like you're right, Faith, but what can I do? I don't know, Mr. Howell, but if I was a smart school teacher, I wouldn't be asking a pupil of mine what to do. - And another thing, Mr. Howell. - Yes, Faith? While you're deciding what to do, for a little while anyway, I forget that the pen is mightier than the sword. [sighs] King Carlos, the big, bad man of the West. I wasn't afraid of you before and I'm not afraid of you now. Oh, rather a spirited young lady, eh? Maybe that's why I thought it was worthwhile going after you. Going afterDo you call sending that mangy-looking group of mongrels to drag me out of church going after a girl? Well, to tell the truth, it was Sheriff Wyatt I was after. A little trick of mine. But when me and my men decided to leave this place, I thought it was about time to let him know who was the boss. I'm not a bit interested in you or your plans, Mr. Carlos, but I'm sure the people of Rim Rock will be glad to know they've seen the last of you. Well, perhaps when you find out that I'm getting on your side of the fence you will think differently. You know the West used to be, "Each man for himself. "Take what you could, and then hope that you live long enough to enjoy it." But now with these trains snorting across the country and the nice people like you traveling back and forth, the West has a chance to put on its Sunday clothes and really go places. So, I thought the boys and I would go along too. Right, boys? That might be your aim, King, but we're looking at things a lot different. What do you mean? All those trains you're talking about coming from California. They're packing a lot of gold, you know. So we're figuring on getting our share of it. I still give the orders around here. I'm sorry I got you mixed up in this, Ms. Wells. Better be getting back to town. [dramatic music] [gunshots] [gunshots] [gunshots] - Where's Ms. Wells? - I sent her back to town. That's the healthiest thing you ever did. [gunshot] Say, if you haven't got nothing to do for the next five minutes, I could welcome your company. [gunshots] [intense music] [gunshots] Well, for a schoolteacher you are pretty handy with those guns, eh? Oh! [chuckles] That ought to make you a very important man in Rim Rock. Well, goodbye amigo and thanks so much for the help. Oh, you're not gonna leave me. Now you've taken care of my men, there's nothing else for me to do. - Oh, but... - Adios. Uh... Seven of 'em. Oh, gosh, now I am in a pickle. [instrumental music] Gosh. Seven of 'em. [cat squalling] What happened? How did you make out? Shh. - K-- King Carlos' men are here. - Where? Now, now, don't get excited. Don't worry. They-- they won't cause any more trouble. I got 'em all right here in the wagon. In the wagon? This will make you the biggest hero Rim Rock ever had. They'll give you a plague, erect a monument and everything. Oh, that's just the trouble, all this time I've been telling folks they should put away their guns and take to reading books and now when they find out about this, they-- they won't believe anything I tell them. We can't let that happen. Faith, y-- you got me into this. You got to figure a way out. Well, how many of them are there? - Seven. - Seven? Well, maybe, we can lay them out on the desert and pray for a sandstorm to cover them up. Oh, Faith. If they were only one or two of them, but seven. Sorry, Mr. Howell, but I'm stumped. I suppose the correct thing to do is take 'em to Sheriff Wyatt. You mean, ex-Sheriff Wyatt. - Of course. - Of course, what? Well, they took Sheriff Wyatt's badge away from him because he couldn't shoot. Now's our chance to get his badge back and make him a bigger hero than ever. - Come on. - Okay, let's go. [instrumental music] These are the last two. Where do you want them? Faith, will you please make up your mind? This one is getting awful heavy. Drape Red over the banister and let the Indian lean against the bar. I sure feel funny taking credit for something I didn't do. But this is the best thing in the whole world for Mr. Howell, you and the whole community. Well, if you put it that way. And I'm mighty thankful to you, Tod for what you're doing. Oh, sheriff, it's me that should thank you. But remember, don't ever let a word of this get out please. - It would ruin me. - Oh, not a word ever. Well, Faith and I got to be getting along. Remember, give us time to make a clean getaway. - Sure. - Be sure and make it seem real. Oh, you can count on me. Oh, what a night. Giddy up. [gunshots] Hey! Hey! Hey! [gunshots] Hey! [gunshots] [clamoring] Oh, oh, oh! [indistinct chatter] Quiet! Carlos' men tried to pull one too many jobs. - I just cornered 'em in here. - Yeah, there they are. Looks like they've been dead for hours. Huh? Well, cart 'em off to the burying grounds. Are you hurt, Jim? Oh, one of 'em plugged me in the foot. [indistinct chatter] [instrumental music] Mathildy, I still say we're lowering our social position. Sara, you don't understand. The whole country is talking about the Silver Dollar. It's an historic shrine. Well, it's still a saloon to me. But it's the place to go. Anybody who is anybody will be here at the unveiling. Oh, alright, Mathildy. But I think we should leave the girls outside. But all the men are inside. Come along, Charity, Prudence. [indistinct chatter] Step right up the bar, ladies. The best is none too good. And the drinks is on the house. I beg your pardon? [chuckles] That's what really happened. But if Mr. Howell ever finds out I told you, he'll keep me after school for the next ten years. I won't tell, I promise, Faith. - Honor bright? - Honor bright. Say, Katie, please look for the last time will you change your mind? The wagon's all loaded and with hard riding, we'll be able to put on our show in Valley Springs tonight. And they'll just love us in Valley Springs. No, pop, we're going in the Silver Dollar. Oh, you're only inviting trouble. You know what they think of us here. And they'll insult you every chance they get. Pop, my mind's made up. Uh... That daughter of mine is getting more like me every day. Come on. [indistinct chatter] Mr. Howell, look. Look who's here. Oh, thanks, Faith. - Mr. Mayor. - Oh, how do you do, ma'am? Those show people are still in town. I thought you were going to do something about that. Oh, well, now, I can't allow anything to interfere with the unveiling, ma'am. But I will take care of 'em afterwards. Well, I certainly hope so. They've caused Rim Rock enough trouble as it is. Yes. [clears throat] Excuse me. [indistinct chatter] Ah, ladies and gentleman. Could I have your attention just a minute please? Thank you. Now, folks, as you know, we're here today to pay homage to the outstanding citizen of Rim Rock. And one of the great heroes of the West. Now, I'm talking about our own Sheriff Jim Wyatt. [crowd cheering] [indistinct chatter] The Rostrum's all yours. Go ahead. Thank you, Mayor. [clears throat] Well, I'm mighty grateful to all you folks for the honor you heaped on me. But, uh, I feel mighty guilty accepting it. Yes, I do. Because, uh, there's someone else's that should be up here in my place. Strange enough, the person I'm referring to is not a man but a girl. And the girl I'm referring to is none other than that stage lady Ms. Katie Wells. [crowd cheering] - Explain yourself, Jim. - Hmm? Mrs. Bassett: Explain yourself. - Oh. Oh, uh, if Ms. Wells, unknown to you folks hadn't cooperated with me and, uh, lured Carlos' men into my trap I'd never got a shot at 'em. So, my hat's off to Ms. Katie Wells. [crowd cheering] I'm-- I'm not very good at words but I'd like to show my appreciation in my own way. Maestro. [piano music] Don't go making speeches Don't go singing songs Don't insist it's me alone To whom your affection belongs Don't say you'll cross rivers You might catch a cold All those words sound very sweet But dear they're so old Don't say you'll climb mountains They come awfully steep Don't go making foolish vows You might be unable to keep So unnecessary Trying like you do You don't have to make those speeches darling Just say I love you Gee but it's great to be living Under western skies Taking whatever life's giving Under western skies Following trails to the sunset Where the rainbow lies Gee it's fun to live Under the wonderful sun Of the western skies [instrumental music]
