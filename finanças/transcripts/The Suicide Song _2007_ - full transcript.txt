Okay, that's enough for this morning. Is that okay? We're going to run. We're going to run. What! Let's just stop here. In 15 minutes, class is going to start. Let's not do it... Three more bike-to-run transitions. You're a devil! When making you work hard passes a point, it's bullying! Then six more bullying transitions. Okay, let's go! Anzu, which one are you, 8 or M? Please watch out, especially for converting conjugation like the above. The auxiliary verbs, "nu" and "su" within the text are... We can't hear you. The auxiliary verbs, "nu" and "su" within the text could be indicated... Those of you that can indicate the auxiliary verbs "nu" and "tsu," please raise your hand. Yes, yes, yes! I don't know, I don't know. Next... Chikamatsu's "Love Suicides" will not be on the college entrance exam, so we'll be skipping that. Turn your text to page... Turn your text to page... Sir. Isn't that bad? Bad? What is bad? Skipping it just because it's not going to be on the college entrance exam? There is a lot of material that has to be covered within a limited time frame. But Genji, lse, and Chikamatsu are now... Quiet. Therefore, isn't that not foryou to decide? I'm not particularly interested in Chikamatsu. But what is with you picking what is needed on your own? Sir, I like Chikamatsu. In "The Crucified Lovers," Osan and Mohei are fighting against the fuedal system so they end up having no place to go, right? That's... Please put your cell phone away. Please put your cell phone away. It's not a cell phone, it's a camera. Please put your camera away. I want to take a picture of your beautiful face. Ms. Hirosawa... Something like that is called "quibbling." Did you know? I understand that Ms. Takahashi likes things like that, but right now it's precious class time. right now it's precious class time. Where the two who don't have a place to go are headed is death. That is sad and beautiful. So what I am saying is we don't want our precious time wasted because of Ms. Takahashi's personal taste. Sir, let's move on. Okay, then... Therefore... lt's love that hurts! Like fighting against your family and society but I'm only for you. There aren't people like that around you. It's better than sex, isn't it? Don't you thinkyou're pestering too much? All right, today we'll just end here and pass out this printout. No! Sir! Please teach Chikamatsu! If you want to do it that much, then go to Shibuya or wherever and find a companion that'll commit double suicide with you! And then? After karaoke, we went straight to Koji's house. Really! Didn't youjust meet him? Didn't youjust meet him? Way to go! Did you go all the way? Read Chikamatsu! What's up with that? Kana, if you keep that stuff up, you're seriously going to get hurt. What's with the "keep it up"? I didn't do it. Aren't high school girls' judged by how much they're fussed over? You only get fussed over while you're wearing the uniform. So was that Koji guy good looking? If you compare him to a celebrity, who does he look like? Well, if you look you'll know. Anzu, I guess you're not interested in boys. I guess not. Looking good. I don't trust them. Is that about your dad? No! Speaking of that, you never talk about your parents. What do they do? Weren't we talking about boys? Kiriko, do you have someone? l have someone I like now. Slow motion! Kana? Kana? I've become helpless. Somehow, somehow Somehow, somehow Kana? everything looks in vain. Everything looks in vain. Kana? Why was I born into this... Why was I born into this... Kana? Where did you get that? Pardon me for leaving. Suicide Song To keep on living is so troubling, isn't it? I wasn't born because I wanted to be. Why can't I commit suicide? Aren't all adults on their way to death? Actuallythere really isn't a meaning. I wasn't born because I wanted to be. To keep on living is so troubling, isn't it? I wasn't born because I wanted to be. I'm thinking of killing him along with me.

Hey look, I got doughnuts. Hey look, I got doughnuts. Snacks too. Don't put it there! Oh, sorry. What's that? What's that? You're doing it again. Shuri, you're always reading newspapers. Instead of reading it on paper, why don't you read it on your cell phone? You can't do cut outs from your cell phone. Wasn't the train late today? It was late. It was late. Suicide accident? Most likely. There have been a lot of suicides lately. There may be those that don't make it on time. Such a nuisance! But there have been a lot of suicides lately. You just said that. Do you think it's contagious? Come on! I'm kidding, I'm kidding! I'm kidding, I'm kidding! Don't say stuff like that nowadays! Which way would you rather die, facing up orfacing down? Stop it, you're scaring me! No, seriously stop it! You don't want to die yet, do you? It's scary... Scary! What do you think about when you're falling? You use it too? Yeah, Riku! Thanks for your hard work! Shuri! I'll make you look pretty. Come on! Why don't we do that? Why don't we do that? Suicide song. Suicide song? Seriously, a plague song. Seriously, if you sing it, you will commit suicide. Apparently the young kids are making a fuss about it. Another urban legend? This one isn't a legend. This one isn't a legend. No, no. Apparently it's a song that became a minor hit and some people know it. Pirated version got around too apparently. There were even souvenir dolls. That's not true. Are you able to sing that at karaoke? lguess you can. We are looking into it! When I seriously researched it, something like this came up. A triathlon star at Seiun stabbed herself in the neck with a kitchen knife or surgery knife or something and died. At Seiun? Was there an eyewitness? There's no way I could know that much. None ofthat is cute, man. It may have been bullying, but... Shuri! I wanted to meet you, I wanted to meet you, I wanted to meet you, yes! I wanted to meet you, I wanted to meet you, I wanted to meet you, yes! With you... On my bike with my full strength, [pedal and climb up the hill. My shirt that is blowing against the wind is not quick enough right now. I finally realized my true feelings. I'm going to go on honestly. This one and only road, Irun! You are more important to me than anybody else. Even if I am rejected, I will not regret. You are more important to me than anybody else. So I wanted to tell you these feelings. If you like them, then say you like them. Be honest to yourself without deceiving. If you like them, then say you like them. Let's confess what is within yourheart. I wanted to meet you, I wanted to meet you, I wanted to meet you, yes! I wanted to meet you, I wanted to meet you, I wanted to meet you, yes! With you... I wanted to meet you! There was a lecture in another district, I'm sorry I'm late. Mr. Kudo, where were you? Well, I went to pick up the Principal at Tokyo rail station... Weren't you chaperoning the students at the police station? Well, I thought picking you up was first... What are you thinking? That girl Anzu Natsuno that found her is pretty rebellious. Is she always like that at school too? What do you mean? She's taking the attitude of calling us fools. Natsuno's parents were... Natsuno's parents were... There was talk that Natsuno made the members of the team work until they were exhausted. Who said that? The underclassmen girls. Are you saying there was bullying? It's only a possibility. Natsuno! What happened? Say the honest truth! What does that mean? Now now, Mr. Kudo, hold on. Ms. Natsuno, you were saying something strange before. You said you heard a song? That doesn't matter. Judging if it matters is a job forthe police. The ones lacking judgement are the police, right? Natsuno, could you tell us again everything that happened today? You ladies know that bullying and suicides have become problems. Are you saying that there was bullying? It's not like that. Because it's this kind of society, I would like to tell all the students about what happened exactly. If it was an accident or suicide. I don't understand what you mean. Sometimes I get scared. Of what? Moro, if you lose one more screw, wouldn't you go for suicide bombing? It's fine, it's fine. It's fine, it's fine. I broke like three already. But you can make bombs, can't you? That's right. ltaught him. Taichi, you're up? Taichi. What? If it's a Lugar or a Walther, which do you like more? Walther. A Walther or a Beretta, which do you like more? Beretta. Then what if it's a Beretta or a Lugar? That would be Lugar. Yeah? Did I say something weird? Not really. Did I say something weird? You don't really have to think about it deeply, Taichi. I said something weird again, didn't I... I said something weird again... I said something weird again, didn't I... It's coming up. It's coming up. Oh, from before? Team M. Moro, Taichi, Riku. Thank you. The start time is 0630 hours. Thank you. Hit! Hit! Hit! Which way? Hit. The "3 no ways" are the pillars of Masaca Magazine. Sex industry masaca, society masaca, and history masaca. You guys' story is only related to the sex industry masaca. We can't devote a whole issue to it. Think about why Chief M became a convenience store magazine and not a national circulation magazine. lthink you need more peppers. That's good! A good example of "Society Oh my Gods" is the Police chief sniping incident. The one dealing with the cult group. The criminal was definitely a police officer who was a follower. But to save the then Commissionerâ€™s career the sympathizers got together and made human resources take action. They removed the criminal and kept him in confinement until he went mad. That's when they found the vague part in the testimony. No way! That's right. Those "no ways" won't be in a national circulation. That's too much cayenne pepper! Isn't it better with a lot? You can't tackle society "no ways" with just basic interest. We pack it with checking and double-checking. You have to go through with your will of independence. We don't have that strength yet. Hit! Hit! Sh it! Shit! Medic! Medic! You don't get it? Someday Japan will be pulled into awar. There won't be any loss for training. There won't be any loss for training. Don't say such a right-wing comment! I don't want to put a magazine out for war games. If it weren't for war games, I wouldn't be here. How about "suicide song"? "Suicide song"? Apparently if you sing that song you die. They were high school girls, but a couple have committed suicide. There was another one from Seiun Girls Academy yesterday. Medic! Medic up front! Take pictures! Two, three, let's go! Medic! Come on, sarge! Take it, take it. Medic! Medic! You mean Damia's "Gloomy Sunday"? "Gloomy Sunday"? What's that? It's a song that hit it big in Hungary in the 1930s. There were so many people that committed suicide because of it that... it was banned in countries such as France and the United States. Rise of Hitler, the dark clouds of Europe, the age of despair. That's a historical "no way"! Seems interesting! I'm sure someone else will cover that. want to do it. Taichi, are you serious? Taichi-Taichi will seriously do it. You can catch high-school girls and listen to their story? With a bloody pleasure. Forthe first time in a while, the circuits are connected. Okay! Moro, Toma, find out how far this suicide song has spread. Give me some expenses for data collecting. I'll be sure to tell the accountant. But she's right there! Kamiyon! If you ask me nicely, I can do something for you. Riku, you team up with Taichi. Okay. Excited? Well, Team M came in last, so whoever survived are to be shot to death. We were all annihilated. Mr. Riku is still alive. Hands behind you. Please hold this. No thanks. Well, it's a ritual, so... Squads move forward! Squads halt! Left turn, left! Ready! Aim! Fire! At times like these, it's best to shoot a real one. Not today. Especially because it's today. Taichi, I don't understand what you're talking about. I don't understand what you're thinking. Cause if! hold a gun, l'll want to shoot it. That's the point. You're better suited to shoot than to be shot. Kana Takahashi Funeral Service He's here! Principal Yorii! Mrs. Takahashi... Shuri! Thank you for coming. Why did this happen? I don't understand. Was there bullying? We're investigating. Is it true that there was harsh training in the triathlon team? In any case there are many things we don't know yet. l'm s orry ! What do you mean by I'm sorry? Please! Hold on a second! What do you mean by I'm sorry? Her poor mother. Ms. Takahashi, why... She was so normal. They're so small. They're so small. It was from selfishness. Committing suicide is the lowest thing to do. You don't have to say it like that, Ms. Natsuno! You're the one that told herto go find somone to commit suicide with. Ms. Oribe. Ms. Oribe. lt's Shuri. lt's Shuri. You don't say things like that here. It's Shuri. You don't say things like that here. You don't say things like that here. An AKB member... An AKB member... Who's devil Anzu? An AKB member... Who are you? Shuri Matsuda. Kana's childhood friend. Are you devil Anzu? No, I'm Anzu Natsuno. You bullied her. What are you doing! Are you in with it too? Are you crazy? Stop hiding it! I don't think there was any bullying. Hey ladies, would you accompany us to that meadow overthere? We are reporters. Monthly Publication Masaca? It's totally lowbrow. Some sick magazine that has a bunch of perverted gravure pictures as they gather like 100 high-school girls and make them rant about the nuclear threat from North Korea, it doesn't make any sense. So you actually check the inside too. Yeah, reading at the magazine rack at the convenience store. Got a problem with that? No. Would you tell us about Ms. Kana Takahashi that committed suicide? We've already told everything to the police. Unlike national publications, we don't just keep it with the police release. Just like we told this girl, there wasn't any bullying. There's nothing to make into a story. It's not like that. We think the "suicide song" may have killed her. "The suicide song"? What is that? We have nothing to talk to you about. Let's go. That flower of yours was a bad idea. I don't understand at all. The song is the medium to make suicide contagious. I understand the "suicide song." lfl believe it or not is a different story, but it's easy to understand. Then what don't you get? Why... Why this? Isn't it odd? You knew? Second row center, third from stage right. Right? You were able to see me from the stage. Better yet, what's up with this guy? It's my first time seeing someone eat a strawberry parfait with all that power. Taichi's concentration doesn't end. He's a former self-defense force soldier, a mercenary. Then he was a war photographer until he got seriously injured. He met Chief M in Sarajevo or somewhere. Chief M? 007? Our editor. He had one of his butt cheeks blown away, so he was lying in the bed in pain and apparently next to him was Taichi. What's wrong? Taichi? The grim reaperjust passed by. This is Tokyo. The grim reaper comes to Tokyo too. I may have just eaten the last strawberry parfait in my life. Don't say something so depressing. Twenty people died in Iraq today. In Japan the parent kills their kid the kid kills their parent the brother kills his sister and the grandchild kills their grandfather. You want to commit suicide by singing the "suicide song." lf politicians are fools, then the grim reaper wanders around. lsn't your point kind of off? It's pretty straightforward. The suicide song is a suicide bomb. That I can't follow. Riku! When you were shot to death, what did you feel? Did you feel a real one? Let's not talk about that anymore. Let's not talk about that anymore. Didn't your chest burst? Didn't you want to scream something? Not really. You wanted to do something about it, right? No,you must have! No, you must have! Not really. It's not "not really." Let's drop it. Let's drop it. No, lwon't. No, lwon't. I said it's not like that! No, lwon't. I said it's not like that! You are the guy that's going to knock down the grim reaper. Want another strawberry parfait? No thanks. I'll get sick. This is a dream. Otherwise why would I be walking in a tunnel alone in the middle of the night? This happened because those weirdos talked about a suicide song. This is definitely a dream. But I'm scared. I hear footsteps too. Please stop it! I don't want to see, so don't shine the light towards it! Kana! Read Chikamatsu. WhatAnzu! Don't scare me like that! What's with you too, Aunt Ranko! Don't scare me! You scared me. Aunt, why did you come running in? Because I heard a weird singing voice. My voice? It was a little different. Good morning. Well, this is... What was your name? Etsuji Toyokawa. Etsuji Toyokawa. Yeah, yeah, Toyo-Etsu. See you. You're not going to eat breakfast? You're not going to eat breakfast? I'm not hungry. Have a good day. Your niece? Yup, she's my cousin's daughter, but a lot happened and she's been passed around the relatives. She's not in your way? No, we get along really well. No, I mean before we start dating. We're going to date? We're not? We're going to date? Well... That was my intention. Why? We're pretty compatible. Of what? You must not harm your body that your parents gave you. You must not do anything to throw away your life. If you have problems, talk to your parents. If you can't, then talk to us... If you can't, then talk to us... Principal... Shut up! Us adults will always... Was there bullying? listen to you third year students. Please stop flustering in front of the TV cameras. Did our parents tell you to collect just third year students? Poor Kana! You can't say the truth? Mr. Kudo. You're right. Absolutely. It was shameful. Mr. Kudo and I became nervous when the camera was turned to us. Us adults are already broken or are breaking. You all are not broken. You're pure. That's why all your sorrows restore us broken adults back to normal. Please throw your young sorrows to the adults. Do that so we do the right thing. Yo! Yo. Hey. There're no ducks today. Were there some the other day? Yeah, there were some somewhere. This is Koji. The guy Kana was dating. Whose computer is this, herâ€™s? Yeah. This morning I got a phone call from Kana's mom. She really wants to know the reason for the suicide so she asked me to search for clues on her computer. Change, we're having practice. Doesn't it bother you? Why Kana killed herself... I can't concentrate on practicing likethis! So what do you want to do? Let's find out the truth. Why she committed suicide... It may be because of the suicide song. Stuff like that the police will... Stuff like that the police Will... Will they? They sure didn't act like they would though. They were trying to make us say that there was bullying in the team. They kept on looking at Kiriko's breasts. That is true. The police will not look far enough into the reason for the suicide... lt bothers us so much we can't stop thinking about it. | feel responsible too. It's nothing that concerns you. I think the boyfriend is connected with this. The guy in the sticker picture? Koji? Kana wasn't the only one that was hit on by him. lt's Koji. He's a talent scout in Akihabara. ls Koji the reason forthe suicide? Koji is a suicide watcher. He has introduced all different kinds of suicide websites. He took her to karaoke and she sang the suicide song. Hey, let me read right there. Sorry, that's Kana's privacy. So where can we find Koji? This photo is the only clue on hand. That's a model-gun shop. That's Moro's defense range. Me? Moro, come here. Please call that guy. Welcome. Yes, welcome. S-S-Smith & Wesson's 4506 or a Dan Wesson 445 Magnum, w-which do you like better? Dan Wesson. l-l thought so. What? What? I want to buy a gun to shoot a cat. Oh, a cat. You can't shoot cats. I know you shouldn't, but K-K-Koji said I could. Oh, you have a referral from Koji? Then you are definitely welcome! Sorry. What's your name? Ri...ck. "Rick," right? "Rick," right? Ri..ck! Rick! l'm "Bazooka." Ri...ck! So how was it? They are calling people over to commit suicide on sites and competing to see how many people they actual got to do it. l was invited too. A suicide game? Where's Taichi? You exchanged email addresses with a scouter? It's a strategy, stra-te-gy. Isn't it here? You're right. For a playboy, it's a pretty dull apartment. Doesn't something stink? Kiriko, you think we should barge in? We're going in? ln horror movies, the one with the boorish sense ofjustice gets killed first. What do you mean by boorish? Are you saying you want to be killed first? I don't understand if you're making fun of me or not. I'm not making fun ofyou, I'm older than you. Man, you make me mad! Man, you make me mad! Why is that? Why is that? Leave me alone! Why is that? Usually in situations like this, there's someone dead inside. Mr. Koji Watanabe, are you home? There's someone behind me! Grandpa, is this your room? lt's open. Um... Excuse me... What is this? Suicide Score Chart G ross! What's with this guy! A suicide businessman? A suicide scout? Over here, over here. What's with this place? What's going on? If we're caught, the yakuza will sell us off. Yo! Koji! You there? Hide, hide! Over here! Hold on! What! 13 minutes earlier What's up with that guy? Um... Excuse me. l'll handlethis. Hey, there's a chair. You exchanged email addresses with a scouter? It's a strategy, stra-te-gy. Isn't it here? You're right. For a playboy, it's a pretty dull apartment. Doesn't something stink? lt stinks! What the hell? Are these all those that committed suicide? Drugs, hanged, jumped off, jumped into... What is this? So gross. Did he use the suicide song as a killing tool too? Maybe as a tool to lure the suicidal girls? What a dirty bathroom. What's the difference between "jumping into" and "jumping off"? I guess "jumping into" is like trains and "jumping off" is from buildings. Aren't they the same? Hey, "My Flower." Isn't that the suicide song? Two, four, six, this is how many times it was continuously sung? Meaning Koji made them sing it. Man, you make me mad! Man, you make me mad! Why is that? Why is that? Leave me alone! Why is that? You think it's Taichi? Most likely not. Mr. Koji Watanabe, are you home? Mr. Koji Watanabe, are you home? Who is that? It's full, sorry. Now what? lt's open. Excuse me. What is this? G ross! What's with this guy! A suicide businessman? A suicide scout? Dam n it, is this that old man's crap? Yo! Koji! You there? Yo, Moro! What are you doing! Photos for proofjust in case. They won't need it, huh? You'll be cursed. Okay, then take the girls and pile into a karaoke box. Experiment and get them to sing the song. Remember to take pictures. Yes. Remember how we used to get the girls to play when we were in Russia? Right? Just like then. But what if they really commit suicide. Who's going to take responsibility. How are we going to report this to the police and all? Use your head. Are the girls wishing to be brought to the police? No. No. Right? We'll take care of that. The first person to find it was Moro. Moro will go to the police. So... Your scentwill get on it! Yeah. Direct it so that they'll thank you and go to karaoke. But... Forget it, give the phone to Taichi. Don't touch things so much around there. Taichi... Yeah? It's the Chief. What's up, Chief? What are they discussing? Regardless of what happens, I don't want to go the police. A person died, Ms. Natsuno. They're the type that don't do anything until someone's dead. What's this? The photo of proof that we mostly don't need. Who's that girl in the white clothes? Who is she! You can't see her? Koji's the only one in the picture. You see her, right? Stop it! Stop it! Young ladies! Let's make a deal. Look at me. Do I look like I would kill myself? I quit the Self-Defense Force and joined the French Foreign Legion. I joined the battle for the first time in Sierra Leone. I flew to Bosnia as a mercenary to help air-transport weapons. That was when l was shot in the head and shoulder. l have steel plates in here and here. Does it look like I would commit suicide? You don't look like it at all. You look like you would kill someone. If you ladies will sing "My Flower," then lwill sing it first. The evil spirit would have to kill me offfirst. If it's an infectious song and we don't get infected in order, then that's breaking the rule. lwill not kill myself. I'm your breakwater. That definitely is persuasive. Taichi... Taichi... That is pretty logical. That is pretty logical. That's dangerous. That is pretty logical. Stop it. Chief M said to leave it to me, didn't he? Yeah, but it's dangerous... It's fine! Then we'll quit playing detective. Then are you saying Ms. Takahashi was fooled by the stupid guys from the suicide site and killed herself? That's the only thing I can think of. Then what about the idiot from the suicide site? He committed suicide due to karma? His manner of death was too strange. His manner of death was too strange. Then let's vote. Then let's vote. I know you don't want the police... Then let's vote. I know you don't want the police... I know you d_o_n_'_t_ _w_a_n_t_ _t_h_e_ _p_o_l_i_c_e_& _W_h_o_ Then it's decided. Okay Moro, please explain the evacuation plan. Everyone will partner up and leave this building without standing out and gather at Nikkimachi 3-3-3's karaoke box, "Lansdowne." All right? All right? Yes. In five minutes, Riku and... I'll go. I'll go. I'll go. You can come with me. No thanks, I'm going. Then you can come with me. Then you can come with me. No thanks. I'm going next. I'm going next. This is bad. This is bad. I'm going. This is bad. I'm going. I'm going. Everyone's waiting for me. The old man broughtthe police. What should we do? You can go up to the rooftop from the staircase in the back. I'll take care ofthis here so you take the two of them. The three of you go. Thethree ofyou go. We're running, so follow me! Wait! Hurry, hurry, hurry! Calm down. Hello officer, I came here as a reporter... Hey, give me a hand will you? We're getting down with this? Go on first! Go on first! Hurry up and go! I'm fine, go. I'll hold it. It doesn't matter which one, could you hurry up? By the train tracks by my house bloomed a small flower. As if it was looking down in the shade without being noticed by anyone. Somehow, somehow I've become helpless. Somehow, somehow everything looks in vain. Why was I everborn into this world? Come on, here we go! Go! Come on, go! l'll shoot you! Go! Come on! A blue train is... Room 14? Yeah. You're a survivor of a forced double suicide. I heard from Kana before. Who did Kana hearthis from? Your homeroom teacher. Kudo? He told her when she wentto him for help about yourforceful personality. If that's true, he's a teacher with a pretty loose tongue. A blue train is passing by and the flower is swaying in the wind. This song... "My Flower." Huh? What, they started already? Taichi? What's wrong, Taichi? l'm stopping the song. I know that song! I know that song! Get it together. Get it together. I've heard it before! Get it together. Why? What happened? Anzu! Anzu! Something's wrong with everyone. Anzu? I said something weird again. Who are you? Who are you! Who are you? Anzu's awake. Where's everyone? Taichi walked them home. It's already late. But why did you stay? lt's whatever I want to do. She was worried about leaving you alone with me. I never said that! l'll walk you home. What are you going to do ifthey all commit suicide? You brought us here and made them sing. Are you going to be responsible for it? You were the one that agreed to it. You should be the one responsible if they commit suicide. You're seeing something special, aren't you? You just want to be able to write the article and sell your magazine, right? You're not thinking about anyone that has been left behind by people that are important to them committing suicide. I'm going home. Surely that might have been true in the beginning, but not anymore. At the very least I want to somehow stop this infection. Yeah, sure! In my hometown there's a lady with really strong spiritual powers. Cabinet ministers and famous actors come to her too. That has nothing to do with me. The person that named me was Ms. Enma too. Enma is a weird name but she's not shady like those old ladies you see on TV. If we bring everyone to see her, we may be able to find things out. Will you entrust me with this? If it's the person that named you, then she's the worst! Anzu! l'll walk you home. Oh, you're still here? | get it, I'll walk you home. Aunt Ranko? I'm going to head home now, is that okay? Uh, sorry, but would you be able to kill about another hour somewhere? Yeah sure, that's fine. I'll be at a friend's house. Anzu! So far no one has committed suicide. We decided to exchange emails every hour. Even if we do something like this it most likely won't be any good. Kiriko, did something happen at home? Why was a person like me born into a family of doctors? Another relatives meeting? They all pull up in their Mercedes and ask me if I was part ofthe bullying. It makes me want to sing that song. Don't die! You promised you would become a designer and give me clothes as gifts. That's right. You have someone you like too. Don't you have a lot of things you want to do? Can I kiss you? I'm just kidding! What are you saying! Seriously? What the hell! Yeah, what the hell! I'm going home. Once I get home, l'll face my family. Sorry to keep you this late. It's okay. See you. Be careful. Hey. Hey... Huh? The guy Koji that lived in this room, did he really kill himself? That's the mysterious thing. l'm researching, but I don't know. Are you a cop? You're Bazooka from the suicide business. Shut the hell up, fool! Even if you guys try to crack down, the number of suicides won't decrease. I'm a savior! Somehow... Somehow... I've become helpless... Why was I everborn into this world? Please forgive me. I'll give you Koji's safe. Suicide bombers too, but people that invite others to commit suicide should be killed! Huh? Hey! Hey! Hey, you okay? Hey, do you need to go to a hospital? Oh man... Oh man... Hey, are you okay? Wounds, he's covered in them. A person is seriously wounded in front of Koji's apartment. I'll leave my coat on him, so could you take him to the hospital? Taichi, what you're saying isn't making any sense. Why don't you take him yourself? Hey, I can't and that's why I'm asking you to. I don't want to. "I don't want to"? Just do it, okay? I'm pretty gone right now. Pardon me for leaving. Taichi? There was testimony that they heard a woman screaming. Maybe there was. There's no way you didn't hear it. There's no way you didn't hear it. Where's the katsudon? Katsudon? Why katsudon? During prosecution you guys usually give out katsudon. We're not ordering. What's up with that attitude! Be serious! Be serious! Mr. Yamazaki. You got mixed up in a really serious incident. I know, right? They're treating me like a criminal. He keeps saying he was scouted when he was hunting middle-age-men. It's pretty much something like that. Could you explain it so we can understand it? Yeah. One night when lwas on my way home slightly drunk young guys surrounded me. By any chance, is this a middle-age-man hunt? Well the truth is... I've been holding it fora while, so... Could you give me a second? Don't mess around! H-Hold on a sec! Wait, wait, wait! Come on... Are you guys having fun doing something like this? Hey... Um... My house is right there. Why don't you guys come by for a bit. Hey, what happened to the rest of the guys? They went home. They didn't find clothes they like? It's all expensive stuff. It's fine because that was the deal to not beat me up. We never intended to. Why don't you have a late dinner with me? l have confidence in my cooking, okay? Aren't we creepy? No, you guys are well spoken and are being respectful. There's something wrong with this situation. Hey... You know what? I'm thinking of starting a magazine but what kind of magazine would you guys be interested in? None. There's no way there isn't any. Seriously, none. Then why don't we make one together? That's a pretty unique story. I got a bunch of eccentric people together to make an energetic magazine. Then what about the data collecting on Koji Watanabe? Oh, yeah... That was for doing a report on suicide sites. I'm saying he touched me, so what's wrong with that? What do you mean by again! There, there. Listen to me. Your fly's open. What! I might kill a person, so arrest me. You want to kill someone? What is it? Adrunk? Go home. Go home. Man that's not a good idea. It's fine, it's fine. The ones that scream about killing are ones that can't even kill a fly. When I say I will kill, lwill kill. Come back then. You guys have no motivation to do yourjob? If you can't move until an incident happens, then I'll make one happen. Cut it out! This is the real one! It's an incident, an incident! Should we arrest him? Taichi, what are you doing? Can you arrest me? Move back. Drop your gun! Yeah? Yeah? Taichi... I took him to the hospital. Sorry to trouble you. It's a little busy over here, so could you listen from over there? Taichi! Stop it! Taichi, stop it! Taichi! Seiun Girls Academy Seiun Girls Academy Seiun Girls Academy West Gate Truly... Truly... Becomes dear to me... You too? 1724 November 22 Death Today we will be doing only Chikamatsu's "Love Suicide." Kana... In fact, Osan and Mohei really... In fact, Osan and Mohei really were not able to commit suicide. Wash your hands! What are you doing? Principal! Ah, well... ljust want to take on the heart of a pro cleaner, but... I'm most likely not making any sense to you. Please explain to me so I understand. Yes. The principal of the first high school l was appointed to was a pro cleaner. He had an organization called "Learning from Cleaning." l was invited to join, but I treated it as a joke. Lately... Politicians with "Let's make Japan beautiful" slogans are increasing, right? Yes, especially politicians with no shame. I agree. That's when I thought... "I want to take on the pro cleaner's heart." Late at night I started cleaning the bathroom and encouraged the younger teachers to help. The action to take the lead in cleaning what has been soiled is being able to fosterthe culture of feeling shame naturally. The "Beautiful Japan" will be born from there. No one followed me. Instead they were saying it'd be taken as a perverted principal that loiters in the girls washroom, so please stop because it would become a scandal. Is what some of the teachers yelled at me... Please call on to the students. I'll do it. I don't know... Anyway, why are you here this early in the morning? lfl sleep, I'll be chased by nightmares. You haven't slept since yesterday? You haven't slept since yesterday? No, I did sleep. Deeply, without seeing any nightmares. That just felt weird. Since the incident with my parents, dreams were always bad dreams. But last night nothing happened. Suddenly I got worried about my friends, so I came early to see them. To tell you the truth last night a girl from another school called inquiring about your parents. Her name was Shuri Matsuda. She is Kana's childhood friend. It seems so. A very levelheaded girl. She said that Mr. Kudo your homeroom teacher had carelessly let out your personal information. When I verified with Mr. Kudo, he admitted it, so I strictly reprimanded him. Please don't worry about that anymore. I'm supposed to speak with him today because he let something else slip out. He's saying that he was involved with a girl on the triathlon team. Going back to the girls washroom What are you doing? Want to die together? Kudo... The one that loves Chikamatsu is me. My graduation thesis was on "Love Suicides." The one that taught Kana Chikamatsu was me! Why did my Kana... Doing it alone doesn't make it a double suicide. You can't commit love suicide alone! You can't commit love suicide alone! That's why l'll substitute her. Smile. Smile. We are Osan and Mohei! Can I kiss you? What? This is awful! Bring a fire extinguisher and a blanket! Anzu! Anzu! No you can't! Stay here! Stay here! Kiriko! Do you know her? Please keep her here! Please! Kiriko! Kiriko! Taichi committed suicide. So did Kiriko! Why! At any rate, let's gather those that are still alive! I'm taking them to my hometown! W-Why! Come on! Bye-bye! Okay, everyone form a single line. Behind me is Anzu, Miki, Asuka Rumi, then Sae. The ocean is so pretty. That's only you, Sae. Hey! Don't disarrange the line formation! Hurry. Hurry. Stay in a single line! Are you tired? Hang in there. Just a little bit! Don't disarrange the line formation! Who cares what order we walk in? Our lives aren't that long anymore. Miss... You can't listen to what I told you to do? I'm bringing you to Ms. Enma in atrain at a certain time and in a certain formation. What do you mean? Even evil spirits let their guards down at times. While the guard isn't as tight, we'll move in the safest way possible. Ms. Enma predicted that if you move on your own, you'll die. Can't you guys live with a little more tension? How is it over there? Forced search orforced breakout, which do you like better? They went into forced search? Yeah. They think his suicide was due to drugs. Chief is still in shock. The magazine's probably finished. Young master! Welcome home! Hey, Mr. Morisuke. Where is mother? We were really busy till yesterday so we're closed today. She went to play golf with the employees. She's coming home at night, right? I believe she was saying that they're staying over. She didn't tell me that! Well, they're in Okinawa, so... One of the members of your group arrived before noon today. This is all of us. No, there's one more. There isn't... There isn't... No, there is. Oh, it's you. Hey. Yo. It took you a while even though you left earlier. Riku, you invited her? Why would I invite her? I looked into Ms. Enma that Riku was talking about. The appointment window is in Miyakoro lnn. Miyakoro lnn's owner is Ms. Riki Nagase. Riku and Anzu both vanished. So it's not good leaving someone out of the loop. We took trains, boats, and the long way here that we can't understand. It seemed as if he was avoiding tunnels. Yeah, there were no tunnels. There weren't any because ofthe ocean? There were no tunnels that you couldn't see the end of. Riku, was that also Ms. Enma's plan? Maybe. I'm tired. Can I go take a bath? It's a cool bath. You should go in. Hold on a second. Please don't say we have to go to the bath in one line too. I will explain the rules first. Never leave this room alone. Don't go to the bath or the toilet alone. Keep a watch out for each other. ln horror movies the one that leaves the room alone usually doesn't come back alive. This inn is a shelter. No spirit can come here. Butyou can't let your guard down. When do we see Ms. Enma? My mother made the appointment. "My mommy made the appointment!" Please make sure! lam. No you're not! lwill. Wait. My flower. Did he really die because of something like this? Chief, the apology press conference is not cool. I'm disappointed. Monthly Masaca is an embarrassment to Japan! This is so stupid. My regards to your wife. Do not put down Chief M! The amazing thing aboutthis man is that he fights the whole Roman Empire alone! From here on are the highlights. You'll regret it forthe rest of your life if you miss it. If we name it our "final issue," we'll be able to put one more out. What's the main feature? Why Taichi-Taichi died. The whole issue will be on "suicide." Is there really a suicide song? If there is, why is it really popular right now? Who's the one that leads them to the suicide song... Great, just great. A battle of revenge or a return match, which do you like? Snowball fight. Snowball fight. Forthat the whole editorial staff will sing the suicide song. Hey, what can I do to become a porn star? Who knows? You most likely don't need that much acting skill. Maybe not, but I don't really know. Thanks for the food! It seems meeting Ms. Enma will betomorrow. Meaning... Meaning... Don't worry. Tonight I will stay awake and stand guard. Huh? That's not that cute either. There's this many, so there should be something. Where's Anzu? Went for a walk. No! You can't go out alone! ButAnzu didn't sing. That's... Well, that may be the case, but still... Okay. Aren't you scared of the tunnel? Tunnel? How do you know about it? Ms. Enma? I didn't say your name, but she said one of the girls would go crazy in a tunnel without a visible exit. So that's why we came here with the boat? And is that why we got off at one train station before our stop and walked? Anyway, don't go off on your own. Let's go back. You want to try it out? Try what? lf I'll go crazy. Hey! Stop it! lf Ms. Enma says you'll go crazy, you will! Let's go back. Anzu! I should have let her kiss me. What? When I was told to become the team captain l was crying saying that it was impossible. She said she would be behind me. I can't imagine life without Kiriko. I'm alone again. At least... I could have let her kiss me. What kiss? Kiss is a kiss! Don't you know? So that's how it is. Kiriko liked you. She wanted to kiss you and do more, but she couldn't. So she reluctantly got together with the homeroom teacher. Fool! You are the worst! lfl didn't have to worry about my underclassmen, I wouldn't... Kissing doesn't matter. lt m atters! That was her problem. The white flower petal... Truly, truly, becomes dear to me... Truly, truly, just like someone. Why am I living in... ...this corner? By the train tracks by my house bloomed a small flower. Even if no one noticed it I will be looking at it just like this. Kamiyon, you made a mistake, right? Kamiyon, you made a mistake, right? No, I didn't. You said "the neighborhood near your house." If we sing it that courteously, maybe the spirit will be moved also. Hey, where's Riku? He took the high school girls and barricaded them in his parent's home. Why? He feels responsible in his own way. Take the camera equipment and go to Riku's parent's home. We'll do a photo story on what will happen or not to the girls. Understood. Kamiyon, I'm worried about leaving Moro alone. Don't worry about him. I don't want to die. I don't want to die either. Sae, Rumi... Thank you for everything up to now. Don't say such a thing! I won't let you die. I won't let you commit suicide. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. Anzu! It's all right. It's all right. l'll sing the suicide song at that karaoke box. It's all right. Don't. Why? You were saying it yourself. To think about the people that will be left behind... April 20, 1997, HHH Records "My Flower" by Ya yoi Yara Yes. | see. Yes, thank you very much. If you find out more, please tell us. What happened, princess? What doesn't make sense? Yara Yayoi died on the day "My Flower" was released. Was it suicide? It was an accident. The screen went black. Didn't we pass here before? No we didn't. On the way home from the debut event, she crashed into a highway divider. Also two days later, Yara's production presidentwho raised her killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train. lsn't someone watching from the back? No, no, no. There is. Then why don't you look? The director of the record company that was in charge of "My Flower"... took a fruit knife to his neck and... l was warned. A reporterfrom a magazine that tried to write a story on Yayoi Yara turned out to die in a weird way. Why you... Because I'm bored! Well do things like that when you're alone! What a boring life. Somehow... Huh? Kamiyon? Kamiyon? Kamiyon? What? Is there some kind of problem? Will we be okay? I'm getting really scared now. You weren't before this? If you pretend to be scared, then you become the first to betaken over. I'm seriously scared. My cell phone has no signal. Maybe it's connected with something weird. We won't be able to solve this case with the power ofthe police. Is the main cause Yayoi Yara? No, we think Yara's was actually an accident. There actually is something that may have been the cause. That day at the event venue someone committed suicide. On top of that, in two groups with three people in each one person out of them had a connection with Yara. What about the other two? They had no connection with Yara, but there may be a connection this time. Who are they? Who are they? lt's Anzu Natsuno's parents. Hey, why don't we go to Ms. Enma's place? If she is really concerned, even if we intrude late at night... We are required to have my mother's appointment. Didn't she make the appointment for us? I don't know the time. Even if you don't know the time, if you know the place... It's not that simple. There are a lot of demons gathered around Ms. Enma. We have to get there at the righttime and route. Demons like children? Is it a nursery school or something? They are the lowest form of ghosts. I don't really get it. If it were the FlFA ranking, they would be ranked like 150th. Oh, that's what it means. So that's how it was. I talked to a detective that knew the situation that happened then. I don't understand much about the spirit world, but I thought you would be interested in this type of truth. We know where Anzu Natsuno is. Could you put her into protection? Unfortunately I am a detective. Even if she comes asking for protection, I cannot do anything about it. Why! It's the same as when seven-year-old Anzu Natsuno demanded protection. How the police think has not changed. Then Officer Hatsukawa, you should reform it! Unfortunately I can't. That's not true! If you steadily collect Bell Marks, you can save poor kids in other countries! You're collecting Bell Marks? Yes, Chief, you don't collect them? Cause, what has Bell Marks on it... Cause, what has Bell Marks on it... Forget about the Bell Marks right now! If the story is true, it means Anzu Natsuno has already been infected! Actually, it may be worse than that. She may be the one that's spreading the suicide? No way. There's one person still alive that's connected with the production of "My Flower." Who is that? Yara's manager. Where is he now and what's he doing? That's him. What! Jake Hojo the Spiritualist? He was the one that stole the song and made Yara sing it. The evil ones prosperthe most, that is today's Japan. At any rate, call Riku and tell him that information. Even if you haven't sung the suicide song, there is a chance just being with Anzu Natsuno could bring danger. l was trying to get a hold of him, but... There's something there, good night. Why don't you go to bed inside? Next to me is open. I'm fine. Then maybe I should sleep here. Come on. I'm fine. Go to bed. Come on. You turnover too much. Hurry up and go to bed! Truly, truly, becomes dear to me... Truly, truly, just like someone. Why am I living in... That song was made by an unknown singer songwriter named Michiko Goi and was brought to the record company. The lyrics and song weren't by Yayoi Yara? Michiko was a great singer and her appearance had this mysterious sexiness. The record company requested me for management. To make a long story short, I was the one that did it. I stole Michiko's song and made Yayoi debut with it. That's horrible! l was the worst. On top of that, l was cheating on her with Yayoi. Yayoi was the production president's lover, right? Yup, she was cheating on him too. The one she loved was me. But the one I loved was Michiko. Meaning you wanted to have Michiko as your possession? That's right, I didn't want to make her everyone's Michiko Goi. lwanted it to be a lesson of how this show business was a foul place. So I chose Michiko's birthday as the day Yayoi would debut. Then all ofa sudden, Michiko showed up at the venue and committed suicide by jumping offthe roof. l was really busy trying to clean up the suicide. During that time, Yayoi died in an accident heading towards Tokyo. It was terrible. It was a terrible day. Are you still alive? You died already? I'm alive. But... Kamiyon is... Another suicide? She fell off the cliff. She's not dead, but I brought her to the hospital just now. Can I take a bath? Sure. This is not common! The people that are becoming affected by "My Flower" are killing themselves! ln lran, there are about 50,000 people that have sworn to commit suicide. It's not fair how suicidal martyrs kill us. Long before mankind had kamikaze suicide squads if the state ofthe war turned against them, they would be bedazzled by their leaders committing suicide. The ones that gathered it up to become a stylish thing were the medieval Japanese samurai. In any event, suicide is a product of mass hysteria. If by sword is popular, then by sword. If by charcoal is popular, then by charcoal. lf suicide bombing is popular, then suicide bombing. One more thing. Suicide is the final ecstasy in the sexual wasteland. | asked the spirit of a suicide victim in the spirit world and 99% of those that commit suicide have no exaltation in sex. Or they are virgins. Or they've recently lost their sexual exaltation. So if you're an active pervert, then you're the farthest from suicide. Then Chief, you're totally safe. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But recently Mr. Mochizuki's item hasn't been working right, so he's been making his lover Ms. Takako wear some exotic underwear. You guys were doing something likethat together? You should watch out Chief. Too many powerful women surround you. Your complexes might crush you down. That's not...true. lam definitely a villain, but I don't forget about revering the dead. There isn't one day that I don't think about her. Thanks to that I put my hand into the spiritualism business also. Tomorrow is her birthday and also her death anniversary. I'll be spending the whole day in this room. Mr. Hojo. What? I don't care if it's as a secretary, slave or your cheer squad. Please let me stay at your side. You pissed me off so much! I can't believe you! About what! You are such a horrible person! Do you change over in front ofthe other guy normally? What do you think guys are! My feelings were hurt too! What kind of examination was that! Is my tongue really that short? I don't know! How much a woman is worth depends on the length of their tongue? What the hell, Jake Hojo! If you're going to move on, there is a way to go about it! I'm going to kill myself! lwill curse him to death! Excuse me. What! I think it's best to die with charcoal at times like this. For the time being, it's dangerous so let's cross. lt's dangerous! lt's dangerous! Okay. In Tokyo the staff are all looking into the background of the suicide song. We'll solve this. I don't know. I can't get a hold of them. Once I finish eating, I'll go to the hospital to check up on Kamiyon. Yeah. Welcome. Why did you have to go to Okinawa? lam this inn's landlady, Riku's mother, Riki Nagase. How do you do, I'm Anzu Natsuno. Miki Oribe. Asuka Kumagai. Sae Miyazaki. Rumi lnoue. l'm Moro. l'm Shuri. Such lovely young girls, thank you for coming! So what's going on with the appointment? When he was still a student, he never studied and was stuck with UFOs, the occult and the "paranormal." The girls that he had relationships with all had "paranormal" faces too! Stop it! I won't! Rare opportunities like this never come by that m uch! Do any of you have interest in inn administration? If you want to work in kimonos... What are you saying! lfl leave you alone, you will never be able to find a girl you want to marry. What would happen to this inn that has lasted for 300 years. That story is not related at all. So that's why I will choose for you. The landlady is everything in an inn. As long asthe landlady is reliable, everything is at peace. On top of that, if she is beautiful, there is nothing to say. You said your name is Anzu, right? What do your parents do? What about the appointment! One in the afternoon is fine with her. It's okay that early? | asked her to hurry. lfl ask her, Ms. Enma will listen to anything I say. lfl ask her, Ms. Enma will listen to anything I say. Aunt Enma, it's Riku. Come on up! Don't be surprised when you see herface. Is she scary? She scary? Scary? Scary? Yes, yes, welcome. lwas so busy I didn't have timeto eat lunch. I'll finish up right now. Are they twins? Yeah. They are twins. You didn't have the slightest intention to commit hara-kiri! Be gone! What the hell are those! Demons... Demons drawn to the stench of death are able to be repelled easily. But... Yours are a little troublesome. Meaning something is possessing Anzu? Principal Yorii, there are rumors at your school that you were setting hidden cameras into the girls bathroom and showers. Is this true? What are you smiling likethat for? Please answer! This is definitely the degradation of a place for education! He's finished. All he's thinking about is death. Please don't say it like that! Oh really, you like thattype ofguy? He's the only man that I respect in the world. Then we should do something. Because tonight he will cut himself open and die. His former life was a samurai that died in destitution. His companions all died honorably, but he wasn't able to do it. Now he longs for death. That's a total lie! Don't overdo it. Anzu, you may be able to save a couple of people. Me? You are running from all your painful memories too much. If you had faced the past, yourfriends wouldn't have died. Aunt Enma, there are other ways to say it. Be quiet, Riku! So is it my fault that Kana and Kiriko died? Wow, you say such twisted things. Those girls died because of their own problems. Butyou would have been able to save them. How could I have? By grieving the dead. There are deaths you must keep in your memories all the time. Well from here on each one of you is going to make your personal decisions. Okay? If you leave from the front door, you will return safely to Tokyo. If you leave out the back door, there is a path to an abandoned train station. That's Beitsu station. There is a tunnel there, and there is the truth. The truth? Well, go on home. I don't have anything left to talk about. I'm going back to Tokyo, but what are you guys going to do? Anzu, there is no need to think about it. Let's get in the cartogether. If I'm going to die, lwant to go home. The sun is going to go down soon. Walking into a tunnel is so stupid. Anzu, if you're going to Beitsu station, Shuri and lwill come with you. Don't drag me into this! You're not going? I'm going, but I don't want someone to say it for me. Mr. Moro, please take care of my underclassmen. Yeah, that's fine. lwon't letthem die. You're still not sure? It's the tunnel whose end you can't see. You won't be able to get through it by running. Beitsu Anzu, the reason why you hate the police is because of the experience from ten years ago, right? lfthe police had acted then, everything would have been different, right? The police can't move unless an incident happens. If only there was someone that stopped those guys... Hey Natsuno! Hurry and open up! Hey Natsuno! Hurry and open up! We know you're there! We'll kick the door down! Hurry up and open! Don't waste ourtime! Please, we will pay by the end ofthis month. It's that one again? Why don't you sell your kidney or liver, teacher! I'm writing a mystery story on the revival of the dead. l have hope this time! Where is your kid! Don't hide her! The concept is already finished! Hurry up and bring her out! She's not here! You're ripping off my favorite writer Stephen King! What are you writing, you bastard! Stop! Please stop! Please stop! Is something getting closer? Riku... The exit is getting closer. We're sorry, Anzu. Please forgive us. Why don't we do it here? Not at a place like this... Let's go deeper into the mountains. It's the same anywhere. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Anzu! I don't think Michiko is trying to kill. She's just sad. So are you saying Kana, Kiriko and yourfriend died on their own? Somewhere deep down in their hearts, everyone wants to die. "My Flower" strikes a chord into the hearts of those people. Maybe the people that committed suicide were just using "My Flower." Using it as a suicide song... You want to sing it when you want to die. So who is the most unfortunate? I think everyone's all about the same in the end. Toma, why are you going to die? Because I am in love with you. l have no regrets. I didn't accomplish anything lwanted to do. lwish I hadn't been born in an era like this. It's because of the internet. It became so that people that shouldn't meet are able to meet. A person who wants to die and the person who would help them... Truly, truly just like someone. Why am I living in this corner? Since you passed away, there hasn't been any pleasure in my life. Is it okay for me to go overthere now? Shall we? Ms. Michiko? Ms. Michiko, are you here? We cameto hear your song. You think shejumped? My grandfather was in the kamikaze squad and tried to attack on the last day. When he started the engine, the wings fell off and he couldn't go. My grandfather didn't fly, but he flew. And this time I'm going to fly. We'll go to Akihabara and make some detonators. So then which embassy should we crash into? The Educational Ministry! The Educational Ministry isn't an embassy. I want it to be somewhere I can eat some pastries. Pastries? France? France? Okay, then France! What am I supposed to do! What do you want me to do? She is repeatedlyjum ping off from here. Until someone listens to herthoughts. Even so, this small flower without a name will keep on blooming throughout the seasons until that day it will wither away. Someone's here. Ms. Michiko, is that you? Ms. Michiko? Ms. Michiko? Ms. Michiko, please sing the song! Your song. You wanted to sing, right? lwant to hear it. I need to hear it no matter what! Riku's not here. To awaken ourfoolish fathers' and mothers' generation. May this become the path to the renewal of Japan. Untie this. In situations like this, you say "Let's meet at Yasukuni," right? lthinkthat's not really... I think it's fine with Yasukuni. Whoever wants to go can go. What is Yasukuni? Is it like a super market? Wasn't your father holding a knife like this? Anzu? Anzu? Anzu? Anzu? Ms. Michiko? Ms. Michiko! The song you wrote, "My Flower," is a song to convey love, isn't it? Ms. Michiko, please sing it. You may have climbed the tower because you wanted to die but you changed your mind, right? That was when you saw me being chased by my father. I remember everything now. You were calling out to me saying to run towards the tower. You didn't commit suicide! Youjumped to save me! My life is your life. By the train tracks by my house bloomed a small flower. As if it was looking down in the shade without being noticed by anyone. Somehow, somehow I've become helpless. Somehow, somehow everything looks in vain. Why was I everborn into this world? A blue train is passing by and the flower is swaying in the wind. It looks like it's going to be blown away any second. A small existence that doesn't even have a name. Truly, truly, becomes dear to me... Truly, truly, just like someone. Why am I living in this corner? Even so, this small flower without a name will keep on blooming throughout the seasons until that day it will wither away. It will not become soil on its own. Somehow, somehow I've become helpless. Somehow, somehow everything looks in vain. The white flower petal... Truly, truly, becomes dear to me... Truly, truly, just like someone. Why am I living in this corner? By the train tracks by my house bloomed a small flower. Even if no one noticed it I will be looking at it just like this. Thank you very much. Good-bye, Ms. Michiko. Good-bye, Mom and Dad. O-Ow! I cut myself, I cut myself! Band-Aid! I really want to have sex right now! Anytime! The direction all of you are going to fly is that way. Fly as if you weren't flying and as if you weren't flying butyou are flying. Off you go! Even so, this small flower without a name will I'm not flying but flying! l'm flying but not flying! Bye! I'm not flying but flying! ...on its own. Why don't we watch over for a little, Taichi. There are lots of stupid politicians, so you don't know what's going to happen. Let's wait and see. This is most likely thefirst and last time us three will see the same dream. I think we are going different ways from now. We will experience different love. The three of us won't be able to be happy as one. Guess not. I don't want to ask Riku in a couple of years which one of us he likes more. Why does the conversation veer that way? To think about death means you of course think about living. To think of living means... Sex? Wait up! What is it? It's okay, Taichi. There is no way I would commit suicide. I might kill someone though. Riku, hurry up! Hurry up! Want to go get a strawberry parfait? Sure. Hurry! Riku! Riku! Run!
