What do you mean? Can you imagine anyone like us paying for such things? It was from the government and I took the occasion. That's why I don't wanna sell' em, pal. You're playing shrewdness. You swindled me out of the books and now you're monkeying about the money. You're wrong. Don't exaggerate it What do you mean I'm wrong? And the date is the 23rd. What's all this fuss about? You'll cash it in two days. But I need the cash right now. I'm a poet myself. I've been told not to let the children in. they make noises and trouble. A fine thing! To you am I a child?

I'll tell you how has it elapsed One day on loving in and other. The other on abandoning has elapsed In the previous session, Controversial opinions were expressed about these verses by Some friends of ours. In one of his old books, Mr Fereidani has discussed this matter. You see this? Huh? Mr. Fereidani, please Mr editor-in-chief, don't you feel responsible to the fact that one Of the country's poets is not allowed to enter his one house, the Circle of poets? Pardon, sir? Yes, sir. Anything you want me to do? Huh? Anything wrong? You need help? Nope. Bye then. Bye. Hello. Hello Majid. Here you are. Here you are. Thanks a lot. What's wrong with you?

Lots of other things I have to spend on. Eat, eat, idiot! The more you eat, eat, idiot! The more you eat, the father you get and the sooner you'll be killed. Majid! Make them shut up! We're fed up with their noises. OK Don't touch them! If I don't, how can I know whether my photo is in it or not? I'm telling you not to touch. It won't be damaged! (A popular old song) (A popular old song) Good for you Asghar! Majid, sorrowless heart's not in the world of being, if there is any; it is not of human being. Really, good for you! You have no concern: neither poem, photo magazine book nor great expectations. Actually never do things match... You should have been the son of a wealthy fellow so that... ...you do nothing but spend money How much do you need? I know you don't have it. I'm glad you know it. Ready? Smile! My sister doesn't Grandma must have asked her not to. Huh? You are too hasty in getting everything you want; haste makes waste, you know? If I had it. I would read that book. Only if... cause I'm broke... Could Jean,... Valjean act differently? Seized by misery He gradually... Anything I can do for you, Mr. Kamal? No Majid, Majid. Been to Kamal's room? Me? Yeah.

The ship does not stop. The wind is blowing. That ship cannot avoid the dark oath extended before it. It passes, disappears,... ...appears, submerges, then emerges from the middle of the sea... ...someone asks for help, but he is not heard. The ship breaks through the storm. He spreads his arms apart The sailors and passengers do not even notice the sinking man... Hello, Haji! I want some millet for this. I'm talking to you! It's closed. Excuse me, but tomorrow is holiday, I really apologize. We fixed working hours. Why have we put this here, then? Give me your card. Hurry up! I'm terribly sorry. If seed or stone could ever think, they would indubitably... think as Jean Valjean did. All these things please don't mention it. Thank you, sister. Come and have something to refresh you. Disappeared! Where have I put it? What must I do? Vanished! What are you looking for? Disappeared! Where have I put it? What must I do? Vanished! What are you looking for? What are you looking for?

What's become of the book you took from Kamal's room... this morning? What? Book? Me? I... tomorrow... ...no it's holiday, after tomorrow... Oh, how terrible! I've got to tell him or he can't sleep till morning. Don't look for it! I've lent it to someone I've told him a thousand times that my books are if no use to you I don't see why the hell he is here for? What's the matter, then? What's the matter? What would you expect it to be? Instead of... siding with me you're backing him up. I'm gonna give him a good lesson. For God's sake, forgive him! Has he escaped? Huh? Let him escape if he can! He's promised to bring it back. Promise? Damn it! This is my home and it must be safe, which... is not. Why must he always be here? You forgotten he's my brother? Must I stand your brother? Is here an orphanage? ...If you were kind enough to him... You aren't fair! - Where are you going? - "Thohfat-ol-Hind", the cheque! I must know what's gone on. Hi! Again in trouble? I've run away from Kamal. I couldn't stand staying alone at home either. Something one is afraid when staying alone It doesn't mean I'm afraid. Not afraid, you just fear! By the way, did you eat dinner yet? Let me help you now, we gonna have it later What have you done with the cheque? Where's my book? Where's my life? Where have you put my money? Mr Kamal! Calm! It's a mistake. Come down, Come down,... Set me free. Mr Kamal! What have you done with it? Set me free. I'll kill you, I'll kill you. Set him free, you are killing him I'll kill you! As long as the cheque is lost you'll be treated the... same way. Don't forget the cheque and the book (The sound of TV) You better leave! I've already got the beating. Don't let it worsen I've brought dinner. You haven't come to any harm, have you? Do human society have such a right? Is such cruel attitude by the society not out of justice realm? It is always the same story These little living beings, these creatures of God are seized by the crawls of events, lacking resort, support and guide. Now let's go and wash your hands and face, you wounded Jean Valjean. Now let's go and wash your hands and face you wounded Jean Valjean. Now let's go and wash your hands and face you wounded Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean does know it well he was not an innocent man punished unfairly.

Good morning! Who's this guy? A guest of yours? No, he's Majid, my workmate. Where's your tea? Do come in. I'm gonna prepare it. I've become homesick in this city (A love elegy) Excuse me, sir!

So, you're a businessman. Is the librarian lady your daughter? Yes she is. And what do you do yourself? Me? What's your name? Majid. I'll recommend you to my daughter, Majid. Well, thanks. But don't mention her about that matter. Don't worry. It's just between you and me. Asghar, Asghar, Asghar. What? What's up? What's do you say? Nothing. Wow! Why hasn't the magazine arrived yet? It should already have been here. Would you be kind enough to forgive their being late? Please get away with you, lest you'll get a big beating!

They're taking film. You can easily find them. Excuse me, sir. Where are the film crew? There they are!

You, the Grand Vizier, which measures have you taken in this regard? the society. You, the Grand Vizie Long life to his Majesty, some measures have already been taken but it is too early to expect any result. Why are you holding the dialogue sheet? For 3 days I've been trying to give him the dialogue sheet but he was always out. I went 2 or 3 time to his house from 12 to one o'clock in the morning to read the dialogue, but he was never home. Why haven't you learnt it by heart? What about you But you know that we have a trial. Where are the feelings gone? And the passion in acting? To me all's your fault Mr Reyhani. I've always said to make copies of the screenplay, but they didn't. Everything is tumbling down! Another take! You are wearing a watch? Don't laugh, or I'll make you breathe your last! Look at this guy with his jeans and Adidas! Take it in medium shot! Why are you speaking the same way? You're the king, he is the vizier, you should have different speech. It's his fault! You've added these dialogues? I've been investigating for 2 years to write each dialogue. It's not a matter of fooling around. Mr Reyhani? Yes, sir. I'll arrange this shot somehow. You take the screenplay and write down the king and vizier's dialogues in 2 separate sheets and have them learn the dialogues by heart. Give me the screenplay. Do you ask me for the screenplay? It's in the car. Go and take it. Go away. You got me crazy. What the hell do I have to do with them? Bring some tea. I say, my handwriting is beautiful. Believe me. I've even taken some courses. I love movie making too. If you really busy, I can give you a hand write them for you. Well, come and write them. Write what? The king's dialogues in one sheet and the vizier's in another. say, where can I buy some cigarettes nearby? Behind that door there are a lot of cigarette sellers. OK. You go ahead. Cut You? I'm Majid. What are you doing here? Huh... as I have a beautiful handwriting, that gentleman... Get away with you. Jump out. I'm to wash the car. I... I must write this. You wash it, I sir here.

You're right. They're poor and I'm the happy one. How do you expect me to get along with you and your damned family? I just wanna know what wrong they have done to you. What else did you expect? Do you want me to thank them for their destroying my life? For ruining me, for making me cancel the agreement, pay damages, for leaving me penniless? Go and tell these to them. Go and insult them, hit them, set them on fire. I can't stand it anymore. I'll be back in a minute. Just a look. I won't let you, I won't.Get away! Get away! Excuse me, I've something to do here.

I don't want you anymore here. This job's too low for me, anyway Published? Later. Pay me my wage. I'm leaving. I needn't pay you anything. You are even on debt. Get knotted! He had to cancel the agreement. What must I do? What can I do? That's what's most annoyed him. Any way out? Mr Kamal, Mr Kamal, Grandma's come to see you. Come down a minute please. Don't you see I'm busy? Most important news! They've published both my photo and my poem. I'm glad. But abiding by some things is a lot more important than this important news How can you justify what you've done in the library? Who told you that? Wasn't it a theft? Who told me about it? The girl who'd taken the changed book. They made JEAN VALJEAN mount the chariot of the condemned ones. I'm really ashamed, Mr Kamal. I know how much damage The other day, we went to the house of the gentleman who'd found the check in the book, but unfortunately he's lost it. I can't afford compensating your damages. But I'm ready to sell this little house of mine if you want me to I'd rather be homeless than... what's done cannot be undone Mr Kamal. The shame's mine, the annoyance yours. I've got tired, tell me what to do. There's nothing else I can do. Say something. Show me a way. I say, you're right to hit him. You'd be right even if you called me bad names or shout at me. Now he's a man, I'm no match for him. I'm helpless. With your silence? Stop it please. Say something, show me a way. Farewell, Madam. Kamal, Kamal, Kamal Where have you been Grandma? Look here! Didn't I tell you? Here's my poem and here's your Majid's photo. You in the magazine? You who are less sensible than this goat? Leave me alone! You're of on use to me let alone your photo. I can't bear either of you. All I'm suffering is for your sake. Are you a man now? A gentleman? Just because you have a moustache? A man must behave like a man. To help with the household, to relive me from my pains, not to cause pain, Not to cause pain, to burn, to destroy. I've brought you up the best I could to be a help to me not to burn me, to destroy me, To be humiliated without being able to reply. How long must I suffer because of you? Am I guilty for bringing you up? Dear Grandma, how much shall I undergo humiliation by you all? By you, by Mr Kamal, by my sister, by my boss. How much do must I pay damages? What a big offence I've committed? They've published my poem and photo, but nobody wants to notice it. How much is 6.350.000 Rials? I'll pay it. I'll pay it. How are you gonna pay that? How? Even if you distribute bread, to be all your life, you won't earn that much. Now that it's so, I'm gonna get lost, die. Now that I'm of one use to you, I show no sympathy to you, I'm a burden to you, well, I better leave you so that you won't be humiliated for me. I'm not gonna get back any more. I'm not a man if I come back I'll go somewhere in which I'm useful. Isn't there a divine essence in each man? Oh yes there is, dear Grandma. JEAN VALJEAN didn't deserve all that torment. He was never understood by the society nor was shown any tenderness; Oh yes Grandma, where the Grandma are like that, what can one expect from the others? Yes he also was humiliated. His poem and photo were published but nobody took notice of them. Oh yes Grandma, JEAN VALJEAN didn't deserve all that torment. No, he didn't. He didn't, you see? Majid, Majid. (A love elegy) All these books, papers and magazine have driven him mad. He's completely lost. I can't control him. Advise him like he's your own son. He's out of my control too. He pays no attention to what I say. And he's rude to me. In any way you are his senior and he's more likely to listen to you. Tell him, "what kind of life are you leading? All day wandering around in the street, in the stores, here, there and everywhere. You know what are people backbiting you?" Let's see what happens. I'll talk it over with him. I count on you. I'll do my beast. Asghar, I'm going. If this lad comes here, tell him to go home for sleeping to be here early morning. All right where on earth are you? You know what you are aiming at? The boss wants to have a talk with you tomorrow morning. He's very angry with you and so is grandma. I don't know if a baker can be a poet or a poet a baker. Well, I don't know either... if a singer can be a baker or a baker be a singer. Occupation is different from preoccupation. I say occupation is different from preoccupation. They're two things. Not always. They can be one and the same, like the master This is your bed and this is your dinner, only for tonight. The kid Who abandons his home and then comes feeling proud of what he has done, is better not come at all. How proud he feels! Nobody's asked you to come. You think you're a man just because of wearing moustache? Then sure you must feel being proud! Look! They've published both my photo and poem. Do read it. Shall I read? I'm a bird, the sky's my poem. No other bread on my table but my poem. I did feel bitter but now bliss. As my tongue's trolling my poem. Beautiful. Why an artist while alive is not esteemed? What Heart-rending a pain for an artist to be underestimated. Bravo! Well compounded! I wish you a brilliant future. Let me help you. Thanks a lot. It's kind of you. Don't mention it. Going somewhere, are you? Yes, to the Poet's Society. Really? Do you fancy coming? I attempted once, but they didn't let me in. I hope this time they will. Praise God for the Master's health.
