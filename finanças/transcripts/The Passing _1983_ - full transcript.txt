A notable welcome to all you music lovers. It's a beautiful day for a musical stroll into yesteryear. Let's not waste any time. Our first selection is Ray Henderson's That Old Gang of Mine. ♪ Hello, old timer ♪ say, you're looking good ♪ what brings you down to the old neighborhood ♪ I miss the gang that has drifted apart ♪ I've got a sad feeling down in my heart ♪ last night, I strolled to that old neighborhood ♪ there on the corner, I silently stood ♪ crowds hurried by, but the faces were strange ♪ even the name of the street had been changed ♪ gee, but I'd give the world to see ♪ that old gang of mine ♪ I can't forget that old quartet ♪ that sang sweet Adeline ♪ Goodbye forever, old fellas and gals ♪ goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals ♪ God bless them ♪ gee, but I'd give the world to see ♪ that old gang of mine You know, Ernie, I'd give the world and its gold if I could bring back the gang to the old neighborhood. Yes, bill, when I look at those houses unchanged by years, in my throat there's a lump, and my eyes fill with tears. And look, down near the school, there's the same old brick wall where we used to go for a game of handball. And then came the parties and dances. That's why we didn't notice the years going by. And the first thing we knew, we were all 21. Gone forever are the pals that we loved. There isn't a trace or a sign of that regular honest-to-goodness old bunch that I call that old gang of mine. ♪ Gee, but I'd give the world to see ♪ that old gang of mine ♪ my friends think I'm a ranger ♪ but I'm the devil in disguise ♪ devil in disguise ♪ when I play the game of love ♪ many women smile ♪ smile ♪ but the lies that I'm tellin' ♪ they're catching up with me ♪ me ♪ white lies ♪ white lies ♪ white lies You don't believe in the human soul? Yeah, I do. We know what you did, and they know what you did, but we got you first! Dump him! Shit! Hey! Hey, man, watch the grass! Rose don't care for doctors much. Rose? They must've slapped him too hard on the behind when he was born. Gives you something to think about, I reckon. Now, Rose, you know the doctor told you to lie still and rest your heart. Oh, Ernie. Don't oh Ernie me. Sit still! I'm not sittin', I'm layin'. You're lyin', you mean! Look there. Ernie, I've got to... You know you haven't been the same since you took up this religious mess. Half-baked philosophers. I must make my reservation before I die. Rose, you're not gonna die. I'm gonna die just like my father died, with my feet on my own sofa. You're too smart for that. Besides, it's my sofa. What's the capital of New York? Albany. - Albany? - Albany. I thought it was New York. I can't stand a smart aleck. You had a very smart wife. Ah, you didn't know her. But I would loved to have known her. She must've been a wonderful woman. Ernest! Ernest! Come fix the damn TV. It's rollin'. When you gonna have my breakfast ready? You're only scramblin' a egg, you're not fixin' a gourmet meal! I'm comin', I'm comin'! These women expect me to come up and down these steps all day. Butter your toast on this side, I swear. Here I am, sweetie. There you are, dog baby. I'm not your dog baby, I'm not your dog baby. Oh, yes, you're my little dog baby. Oh, get on with you. Rose is the best guy I ever knew. He and I served together in the war. We were liable to be killed any time, and so we tried to drink Europe dry. We never could get it done it seems. Gentle reactions to Jewish ideals. That is gentile, gentile. Gentile, and Jewish. Hey, where you going, Ernie? Well, shit! The pitcher went to the well one time too many. Ernie, Ernie, Ernie! God damn! I'm bleedin'! I'm fuckin' bleedin'! You're not bleedin' bad, come on, come on! Put your weight on me, put your weight on me! Come on, put your weight on me! Come on, come on, come on! What happened? What happened, man? What happened? We must have overrun our position man, come on! Fire! Say, you know any yiddish cuss words, huh? What's that mean? Go to hell. Yeah? Know any more of 'em, huh? Yes. Yeah, now, what the hell does that mean? It means kiss my ass, motherfucker. Maybe it was luck, maybe we were meant to end up together. Medic, we got wounded! If it hadn't been for that French girl, Gabrielle, his derriere might still have been out there. Drop! Grab our man, let's get the hell outta here! Give me a hand with this guy, come on! What about that guy over there? What about that guy over there! Hey, hey! Hey! Hey! You know, my wife don't care much for black men. Anyway, when she died, Rose come over, and we had a big party. You understand what I'm trying to say now? What are you talkin' about? Man, I been at you all night! Now, hold it, hold it, hold it! I guess he just stayed on after that, buddies. That's the ugliest damn pajamas I've seen. No, I ain't goin' around there naked. I wouldn't be caught dead in those damn things. These are my burying pajamas. Well, you shoulda buried 'em a long damn time ago. Over my dead body. You wanna bet? I'll bet. All right, let's see here. Heads, I win and tails, you lose. Heads. Take 'em off. Well, what I'm gonna wear? Well, that's all right, Ernie will fix you up there. Ernie will get you some pajamas. No, I don't want any pajamas you get me, I don't want no stolen pajamas. I'll get you some purdy pajamas. Please, please, please, I don't want 'em. That's all right. Nothing that you steal I don't want. If you're gonna steal pajamas, you gotta have a getaway car. Stealing's not much different than fishin'. It's a recreation. It's all the same to Rose, though, stealing's stealin'. He says, one day, I'm gonna be on every wanted poster in town. Alls I can say is I hope they can wait till I get my teeth fixed. That's not bad, look at my teeth! I got some new teeth, boy. I'll give 'em a smile, how 'bout that? Can you smile, Rose? No, you grinning, you're not smiling now. Oh, all right. Let's go on in here now. Watch your step. Get this curtain. I gotta go down here a minute. You can wait for the picture, will you, Rose? Okay. - All right. - Go ahead. Okay. What's the capital of Minnesota? St. Paul. Aw, hell. Rose, will you do me a favor? Will you do something for me? I'll do anything for you, Ernie, anything. - Do something for me. - Anything you want. Just get well. Your age creeps up on you. That's the way it is. We're looking for new worlds to conquer, and I think we have some new worlds comin' up. Some of these are pretty good, I like that solid log. To steal is a sin. That's a good deal. Stealing is a sin. What, you don't like your new pajamas? I don't like them 'cause you stole 'em. Well, Rose, I stole 'em for you. You oughta have done it. Rose, I don't know, you don't oughta get so darn upset about this stuff. It's just the principle of the thing. The principle. Of the thing, yes. Oh, lord, our heavenly father, please help my friend Ernie. Help him to know which way to travel. Goodnight, Ernie. What's the capital of Raleigh? North Carolina. Aw, damn. Would you come with us please, Mr. Neuman? Questioning, they brought me in for questioning. Of course, I told them I had no idea why somebody would abandon a stolen car on faucet mill road. I stuck close to that story as liquor to spit. They only kept me a couple hours. Anyway, while I was there, I heard this noise down the hall. Being curious, I looked. There were a couple of coppers, and in the middle of them was this guy. Now, the coppers were dragging him down the hall. He didn't look so good to me. His feet weren't even touching the floor, and he kept mumbling, "it must have been the cat, it must have been the cat." So I said what cat? He just glared at me. Later, I found out he was going to the gas chamber. I guess you're half crazy when you're going to die. We're running down the time, let's go. How much time is left? 15 seconds. 10, nine, eight, seven... Hey! What? I want my lawyer. He's on his way. It's almost midnight. Fuck. Monica. Yeah, I'll be right there. Look, I told you to get the fuck off me! Now leave me alone! You all right? What'll you have? Give me a 7 and 7. Sure. ♪ All that I need ♪ 'cause you're not at home, you're out wandering ♪ leavin' me to find my way he didn't hurt you, did he? What's it to you? Sorry.

It's the most ridiculous thing I ever saw. ♪ Give yourself to me ♪ you love me too are you sorry for the sins of your past? Are you sorry for the sin of murder? Well, that is something to think about, isn't it? Folks, in case you just joined us, this is the Richard ranch show at daybreak here. I'm speaking this morning with miss Frieda Delorian. Delorian is the author of the forthcoming book, which I'm sure you'll find very fascinating, I certainly did myself. The title of the book is the new paradigm of time. Now, miss Delorian, I hate to dwell on the subject of reincarnation, but. If you want to lead this one. Okay, with your arms in front, we'll swing them back, out to the back. You want some toast, pud? Can you say toast? You want to count first? I knew that you could. One and two and three and four, and one and two and three and four. Two and three and four. Two and three and four, and one and two and three and four, and one and two and three and stop. That was a good one! I could do that all day. Can you say strawberry, pud? - I can tell. - I sure have! I'm sure you'll feel that way too if you've been taking our exercise program. Say, invite your friends over! They'll get good and trim and may even make some new friends! Okay! Okay, let's go. Now, don't you feel better? If you get up in the morning and do your exercises, you're really ready to face a hard day. This is my last one, I swear. Look, I promised your mom. Have a nice healthy attitude about your body and your diet, okay. A stripper in a previous life. Look. See? All gone. See, we're throwing 'em away, the last cigarette. Look... Where does that temporary energy come from? It's energy that has been used before and it just remembers... What's wrong with this damn set. Scientists believe. Let's speed up for now. Double time, come on! Nonetheless, it's difficult for me to believe, miss Delorian, that I may be going around leaving my ordinary life and day-to-day, and all of a sudden these occult elements can just jump in somehow, and take over. It seems a bit like science fiction or something. Well, you know, it's kind of strange. Science fiction is becoming more and more real each day. In my book, I just try to explain some of the things that are happening, that people will probably find out in the future, are really happening. Okay, just tune in every morning at this time, and you can join us and all our friends, and you can bring all your friends too. Genetic engineering and the aging process, so stay tuned. I would think that you have got about three months, at which point that eye is going to be ready to be operated on. And once the cataract is out, the only way we're going to be able to make that eye see well is to fit it with a contact lens, in order for that eye to work well with the unoperated eye, the right eye. Here you go. May Buddha bless you or Krishna. Thank you. You listen to me, Rose! You know you gotta die, and I know I gotta die, but dammit, what are you gonna do about it? You gonna sit there on your butt and whine and carry on with this damn religious stuff? Dammit, Rose, what about our future? I don't know how to help you, Rose. I been reading the Bible. Aw, that is a mistake. It says I either believe in Christ or go to hell. Well, you're between the devil and the deep blue sea there. Got to believe in something. Well, I don't know. Believe in the Bible, you gotta worry about going to hell. Believe in Buddha or Hinduism, you gotta worry about, well, maybe I will or won't get reincarnated. If you get reincarnated, you know, you're liable to come back as a white man. Then you'd be in hell of a state, wouldn't you? But if you don't believe in nothin', man, if you don't believe in nothin', you got nothin' to worry about. Are you ready to eat? No, I'm fasting. Fasting? Why, you skinny as a rail now. ♪ I've been working on the railroad ♪ all the live long day ♪ I've been working on the railroad ♪ just to pass the time away ♪ can't you hear the whistle blowing ♪ rise up so early in the morn' you know, when you're young, why, you think you'll never grow old. ♪ Dinah, blow your horn you'll worry about it when it happens. ♪ Dinah, won't you blow the first thing you know, you're 20, and now you're 40. And then it just goes faster and faster. ♪ Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah ♪ someone's in the kitchen, I know ♪ someone's in the kitchen with Dinah ♪ strummin' on the old banjo I used to think, when I got old enough to drink, I'd be really livin'. And then I thought, when I had a woman, boy, that'd be it. Well, it looks like death's right up there with livin' these days. Pretty soon, time's all gone, and there you are, eyeball to eyeball with the thing, and you still can't make heads or tails out of anything. Shoot, I don't care much about dying myself. It's just when I get to thinking about Rose, hell, I get lonesome. And those young guys, they heading for it just like me. Blind as bats. And I can't help them, like nobody helped me. One thing I'd like to know, how we ever got so damn old. I'll give it to you, but not like this! Stop torturing yourself, what's done is done. Okay, what's done is done! You gonna retire to Carter? Oh, no, I'll retire to the mountains. I retire every night, nine o'clock. Hmm, that's some cough you have. Yeah, I worked hard for that one. I know, well, you'll have to keep smoking if you want to keep coughing, right? Right. - Sure looks like it's gonna rain, doesn't it? - Yeah. I tell you what, let me listen to this heart again. Still beatin'? Breathe deeply. Yeah, well. You know, I just happened to think of something, Ernie, I feel sure it would appeal to you. It's an institute right here in town. It's a program they have there for geriatrics. Yeah, old fogies, huh? No, well, we don't call 'em that, we give 'em a fancy name. Anyway, it's an experimental program, but you have to be on the waiting list, and if you want, I can put your name and address in for the mailing list. Would you like that? Yeah, I'd like to get some mail. I haven't had any mail in a coon's age. You know, Rose never got married. He had a girlfriend for a while though. One day, I asked him, what's it like living with a white girl? Well, he didn't say. Rose was always a gentleman. When was the last time we had a piece? Oh, heck, I don't know, that's been so long ago. You know, I forgot how it felt. But you, don't you remember those two gals we had down on the river? I had old Susabelle. Susabelle! - She was a fat one, wasn't she? - She had a whopper, she had a whopper. She had a lot, didn't she? Till her old man run us out the woods. Yeah, did you get your pants up? No, man, I left 'em. I didn't get 'em, I left 'em. Oh, my. Remember that time I was caught in that chicken house? That got lights in it. Chicken line. Didn't want to see her no more, you know? Those were some days. Good old days. I don't know, I guess. No lead in the pencil anymore. ♪ Everywhere ♪ I'm forever blowing bubbles ♪ pretty bubbles are you scared of dyin'? Oh, no. Dying is a punishment to some. To some, it's a gift, and to some, it's a favor. Who said that? The Seneca. ♪ Then at daybreak ♪ when you awake I guess we'll need a favor. Every man steps away from his light at some point, just to gain perspective. He studies the way the light hits the canvas, and he says, I think I'll apply biscuit yellow today. Some days, he adds smooth purple, some days gray, and some days a heart of burgundy. No matter, he knows in his blood when the emotion is right. And when it is, he knows enough to set aside the picture, to give up when it's time. Ernie and myself, we just want to say thanks before we step aside. It was fun while it lasted.

The less I knew about the energy of that machine. We found where it went and I turned the crank again, and that machine began to rattle and snort and started up like a sky rocket. And there was a lot of things happened and the last time. That machine ran over Hank Weaver's dog, tore a hole through Willis Macon's fence, knocked over Cy Bettenhill's beehive, and kept right on a-going. We're going to take a short break to allow our sponsor a chance to identify himself, but don't you touch that dial. We've got more music coming up. We're just taking a few samples, Mr. Neuman. We're taking a bacteria count. Yeah, but sweetie, I wanted a back massage. Ouch. Mr. Neuman, why don't you have a seat here? I'm gonna be back in just a few moments. I'm gonna take these samples down to the lab. Now, don't wander off. All right. Dr. Henderson, please see patient Elle Taylor in psychiatrics. The law of averages, you get better. You don't go into an operating room with that attitude, doctor. There are no guarantees. What I've seen here is in opposition to every human principle. Granted it's science, but about the moral issue? From what you've told me, you've made mistakes, you've jeopardized human lives. And you haven't? - Not like... - Think about it! How many patients do you think died because your administration refused to pass the referendum? For a person who's so moral, you seemed rather interested in that operating room. What are you talking about? Did you see the way that woman squirmed? Some portion of her was fighting you. You're playing with the human soul. Fail and it's dangerous enough, succeed and you're not doctors, you're murderers. Have a nice day. I'll see you later, bye-bye. What is that? I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. Did you know they're gonna shave my head? Did you know they're gonna shave my head? Did you know that I was gonna shave my head and cut my hair? They're gonna shave my head! Isn't that funny?

Look, can you leave me alone with him, just for a minute, all right? All right, but you haven't got much time. All right. How's it going, Wade? Okay, Wade. Is there still time? Have we got any time?
