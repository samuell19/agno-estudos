Not to be confusedwith the steak - although that is my favoritefood in this institution, Jell-O is not bad either, but I suggest you take a pass on that meatloaf. You sure are onefor conversation. What can I helpyou with Joseph? Joseph? Joey, Joe Joe, Jay bird, Jay Jay Dynamite! What is it? I want to be movedto another room. Well, I can't dothat right now. Why not? All the other rooms are full. If you wanted me tobe quiet, Jay bird, all you had to do is ask. I'm sorry Nurse Amy, therewon't be any more trouble. You just let me know if youneed anything else, okay. I'm just go'n to mine my own. I do me and you do you. I'm just gonna get backto putting this here... Engine together. Mr. Jenkins, we have you scheduledfor physical therapy. Mr. Jenkins, Hmmmm... Joseph. Look I'm doing my best. But you're going to have tomeet me at some point here. Your life is over Joseph. You're old life that is. Excuse the mess, I don't reallyspend much time in here. Much less time to clean. I don't typically bringpatients to my office. My first three years here, I kept a scrapbook... Of all the patients I got toknow and I guess I felt like... maybe I made adifference in their life. Everyone in this book, went through an experience. Just like yours, where inan instant, it all changed. To some, they thought they were lost causes. But each andevery one of them, ended up doing someamazing things. This is Kate. She was 22. Four days after her college graduation, she lost her leg. She got a great job. Got married and is nowpregnant with her second baby. This is Jake, he's amurder ball champion. He's for the Carolina Crash. This is Meredith, she's a mom, has three kids, husband, was a lost causeif there ever was one. She becamean author. She's currently workingon her third novel. All of these people aremuch worse off than you. Joseph. They went on to do great things. You can too. When I wake up, I getthis emptiness inside. I have the yearningto feel the rumble... of a big block V8. The dead calm right beforethe flag comes down, and 3 gs arepushing on me as I go fromzero to 120 miles per hour. It was more thanwhat I did... It was a part of me. How am I goingto get that back? What could youpossibly do to help me? Cement 196A fuelmanifold, the filter, then sub assemblenumber 202 connected... Cement the fuel pump monitorthe fuel pump and fuel manifold. What the heck isa fuel manifold? It's what distributesthe fuel to each of thecarburetors. Aha he speaks. You know what JJ? I knew you wouldcome around. Yeah, well I justcan't believe it'staken you this long to finish buildingthat engine. Well, maybe I'm just not whatyou would call a car person. Gearhead! Say what? a personto modifying cars, hotrods and engines, anything mechanical. A-huh. Well, now baseball... ask me anything youwant to know about thegame I can tell you. San Francisco's own BarryBarnes broke the all-time single season home runrecord when he hit 73, which broke the 70 markset by Saint Louis Cardinals first basemanMark McGwire 1998, see what did I tell ya! Well I guess you'renot into baseball? Nope. But go on, anythingto help pass thetime in this place. Well, when you'vebeen in this place aslong as I have, you figure out all kindsof ways to pass the time. Well it doesn't looklike I'm going anywhereany time fast, so! Well, then Iguess I could showya... the list. The List? A collection of thebest time killers, each one personallytested and perfected. I would like toget a copy of that. Son, I said... I would haveto show ya. You've got your bearingson that thing yet? I thinkI can manage. Well I tell you what, why don't you strapyourself in and follow me. Looks clear. Come on son, I thought youwere a racer car driver! Oh this can't be good. Alright, let's go, do it. Get it in there, get it in. Ahhhh! One more try. Okay, okayalright It's in. Yes! Ha ha ha Yeah! Now this here, is about my favorite placein all of God's creation. They get in theback of your mind, this might be the lastbeautiful thing you ever see. And that would bealright with me. Hey Eli... Thanks Yeah, neveryou mind Jay, training'smy pleasure. Oh Oh! Yes yes yes! Ahhhh The good stuff. You really know yourway around here. I've been in and out of theseplaces for the last 40 years. You've just got to find a wayto keep yourself entertained. 40 years? I can't imagine. Since about my senioryear of high school. I was the biggestthing on campus too. All Star pitcher. I had the staterecord in strikeouts, everyone knew I wasdestined for the big leagues, I had scouts knockingon my door every other day. That uhm... my prom date thatyear was Sally Wilcox, prettiest thingyou've ever seen. Nice too. You might say we were a perfect match. I drove to herhouse that night. To pick her up, parked the car, headed upto the house. Heard the screams evenbefore I got to the door. Sally's daddy was a drunkand he liked to beat on her. A secret she had keptfor nearly a year. I charged through thedoor, pulled him off her, wrestled himto the ground, gave him acouple licks. It ended, gotSally to the car, dress all torn and bloody andput her in the passenger seat and was aboutto close the door and felt a burningsensation in my back. Then anotherand another. And there it was... Shot 3 times in the back, never to walk again. And left with a heartthat's barely hanging on after all these years. But my number's finallyup on the transplant list. How did you do it? It's about faith, butit wasn't all bad... Sally daddy ended up in thepen and after a couple years... Me and Sallygot married! Really? Yes sir! Ha ha ha Now that's a story. Yeah, don't get me wrong, I was upset about it forquite a while. Yeah but in time I come torealize you've got to get right or you'regonna get left. What's that mean? Let me put it toyou this way... Every man runs a race and at theend of the race there's a prize. For some it's moneyand fame, glory. But, those thingsdon't last forever and not all races endat the finish line. So you've got toask yourself... What am I racing for? Hmmm. Dad? Hey kiddo. Hey, Hey mister. What's your name? Joseph. What happenedto you? Miles! Get over here and leave that man alone. We brought you some food. Mmmmmm, smells heavenly.Did you bring the corn bread? Oh I got it right here! Awww. Joe Joe, let me tell you, you want to get in on thisright here, I'm telling ya. No, I'm good. Oh, that's nonsense, just nonsense. Boy come here, mind yourGranddaddy and give thisto Mr. Joseph. Boy I tell you, you're still asstubborn as the day we met. Takes a strong man towithstand my husband. You're going to bein my prayers son. Pastor had a greatmessage today! Sure did. Oh yes yes, it was good. Amen, yes. Amen, Amen. Thank you Jesus! It was boring. Miles! You betterwatch it! Okay Momma, geez. Excuse me, what didyou say? I mean yes mam. That's what I thought. Alright enough ofthis, I'm famished. Let's eat, come on, let's bow our heads. Gracious Father we thank you for this day. For this family, and for new friends. May we realize Lord that you give strength to the weak. Lord God, you are the healer of the broken. Father we ask that you give us strength during these difficult times. Jesus, we ask that you forgive us for not trusting in you. Thank you, thank you Lord for every new breath. Let us not take for granted the short time we have left here. May each and every moment from this point forward be a reflection not of who we were Lord, but who we are today. To you be thy Lord for ever and ever, Amen. Hey man. You all set? Yup. It's been real, Jay Train. Yes it has. Thanks forkeeping me busy. No problem. Don't be a stranger, huh? I won't. Is this you? Yup. Here we go. Nice ride! Dude, it's free. Okay. No, I've got this, I need to do it. Okay. I'm sorry aboutthe car Dad. You oughta be sorry, that car raced for two seasons. Two seasons withoutso much as a scratch, then you get in it andyou flip the thing over. That old Max Wedgemade 525 horsepower. We broke therecord at Indy. It was 11:21 at 121 mile/hour and we went onto win the event. But still it wasnothing like that day. Now that, was amoment to remember. We'd just taken homethe 1990 championship. We were the"unbeatable team"they used to call us. - Your Dad and I. Uncle Paul? Yeah! Uncle Paul, that was whatyou used to call me back then. Mind if I sit down? Oh Yeah sure, sure. That was the lastrace in the old cuda. He ran straight and hard, but the next season we got a new carrunning pro-stock. I remember. Yeah, but I'm sure you'rewondering why I'm here? The thing is, I've beentrying to get the courage to come see you ever sinceyou had the accident. I didn't have the strengthfor that and I'm sorry. You don't owe me anything. No, no I think I at leastowe you an explanation. For what? About the crash thattook your father. What's to explain, firstround of the qualifying. Car got out of shape, hecollided with the side wall. Right? Your father told me, thathe felt like the backend was shaking so much thatit was going to come out of the frontend. I tried every adjustmentthat I could think of, but... The floor length, rearshocks, everything. And I never quitefigured it out, but still I insisted thathe go on and make a full run, and keep his foot init and you know the rest. After that day I drankmyself into an oblivion. I lost everything I ever hadand I never forgave myself. The reason I'm here is becauseI need you to forgive me. Joseph I should'vebeen there for you, I wasn't and I amtruly sorry for that. So, you said that uh, the most horsepower you ever gotout of that Max Wedge was 525? And that wason a good day. We got her up t0625 on the dyno. 625? 625! It looks like it'sclearing up a bit, would you like to goget some fresh air? That sounds good. 625? 625! Ha! Right over there is somethingyou don't see every day. 1932 Cadillac V16. They stopped making thosebabies just before WWII. Of Course right here isthe Ford flathead V8, preferred power plant ofhot rodders everywhere. This place is incredible! Yeah, well I've got somethingelse I want to show you. Hang on... Pro stock engine. Just like Dad ran. Hey! Take a look at this! Tada! This isn't real... Dad's Barracuda! Yeap! I didn't have theheart to sell him. Amazing. ADRENALINE. Perfect namewouldn't you say? Oh yeah. Yeah he's tried and true, battle scarred, that's for sure. Hasn't been runin over 20 years, but I think witha few tweaks here andthere he'd be just fine. Wheelie bars, Lexan windows... That's a tubechassis right? Yes it is! See that button onthe steering wheel? ... Tranny brake! What I would do tofeel a kick like that. Well I do just happen toknow a guy who knows a guy... I'm that guy. There you go. Ha ha ha. Figured next time Iseen you, You wouldbe in a wooden box. NO, I wouldn't do that to you, You would miss me too much. Is that right? That is right! So who is yourfriend here? Come on takea closer look. Ronnie's boy Joey. Joey? Shoot boy, you've seenbetter days I reckon. You've got to forgive Bennie, He's not much for conversation, it kind of confuses him. Hey! All seriousness, yourDaddy was a great driver. I used to let himtest out here. Ha. Seen better days I guess! No, it looksabout the same. Ha. Now that'snostalgia boy. What's y'all doing allthe ways out here anyway? Came out here to teach thisyoung fellah how to drive again. What? What? You said you wanted tofeel the kick right, there's no betterplace to feel the kick thenright here on the track. I think you're missinga pretty important piece here. Look all I want to do isget you back into a car so you can get thefeel for it. I'm not talking about breakingany land speed records. But I do want you toadjust to something new. This is the best place, ifyou want to learn to drive. You don't haveto race again. But you do have tobe self-sufficient. You're out of your mind. That may be, do you havesomething I can put him in? Okay this is obviouslya whole different carthen you're used to. Tell me somethingI don't know. I want to start by workingon your coordination. Yeah, I got it! I'm thinking we'd go awhole lot faster if youactually start the car. Pull it up to theline, nice and easy. Oh he's lost hisdang mind for sure. I can't watch this. It's okay, don't worryabout that, back up. You've got this, justtry it again, let's go. No way! I can't do this. You don't havea choice. You're goingto do it. But we're goingto crash. If we crash, we crash! Now on three, you ready? No! 1! Steady boy, steady. Haaaa! Alright, ease off, counter steer. Okay. I've got it. Brake. I can't, I can't! Brake, Brake, Brake! Brake! Now that's whatI'm talking about. How do you feel? Let's do itagain. Let's do itagain, Ha! Alright, backit on up. Boy can't hardly walk. But he sure can drive. We must have ran thattrack like thirty times. Finally had to stopwhen the sun went down. That's incredible. I... I can't believe it, that's great. Yeah, it was great, just... great. Maybe one day you'll geta page in my scrapbook. Hmmmm. That was just for fun. Felt good though. Well you only have afew more visits with me, I'd say I've helped youjust about as much as I can. Got any plansthis weekend? Ah... uhm. Or not, there's a points racetomorrow and I just thought. Yes, I'll go. Oh! Okay! Haven't been to a racelike this in a long time. Everything is the same, the sounds, the smells, everything. Missed it? Never thought Iwould, until now. I grew up on the track, everyweekend this was my world. Nitro fumes, burnt rubber, popcorn with butter. Extra butterfor me, ha. Everybody lovesextra butter. I know the feeling. I had a placelike that, that my Mom took meto when growing up. Yeah. Yeah. What wasthat like? You don'twant to know. I do, tell me. Don't makefun of me. I won't. My Mom used to take meto this place called... "Mary's Gone Mad" Basically, this lady oneday just started painting, everythingin her house. Everything inside andoutside of her house, windows, toilets, kitchen sinks, you name it shewas painting it. People in the communitystarted finding out about it and just would show upto see what she was doing. She builtthis chapel, like a full on chapel out ofglass bottles in her front yard. I don'tbelieve it. Which I have tosay was incredible. I don'tbelieve it. Well, I will just findyou a picture then. I'm going toneed to see it. Cause it's amazing. Okay. So whatabout your Mom? I never knew her, she died when I was born. And my Dad raised me tillI was twelve years old and then he died. Then I was in and out of fostercare until I was eighteen. But luckily for me though Traceand I kept in contact and... As soon as I was out, it was like I had neverleft the neighborhood. He's a good friend. He seems like it. What are they doingto their tires? They're spinning the wheelsto get the tires hot and sticky, so it will have bettertraction on the track. Put your ear plugs in. Huh? PUT YOUR EAR PLUGS IN! QUICK! Woohoo! That was so much louderthan I had expected! That's a rushfor sure. Was that fun? Yeah. Newcomer Jason Skinner, pulls up to the line for the final run of the night. He's had a great season so far and has finished up very well in his class. And here to play there's no doubt about it. If he pulls it off today, it will be his third straight win. Did he say... Did he say best in state or best in the country? Who are you kidding slim, racing is no place for wannabes. It's not in your DNA okay. Your old man didn't have it, you don't have it and you never will. Joseph? I want to race again! I can work hard, really push myself. Hey, hey, hey, slowdown, slowdown. What are youtalking about? There's a racein three weeks. I want to do this,I'm going to do this! Are youabsolutely sure? YES! Meet me at thetrack in the morning. I'll be there. Oh boy. Hey, I gotsomething for ya. Woohoo! No way? Way! How did you get this? Oh, I figured your Dadwould want you to have it. This is legit. Alright, this is it. Trace get my helmet. Wait? Hold on a second. Am I missingsomething here? I'm goingto race again. How? He's been practicing. Boy knowswhat he's doing. This is LEGIT. So you in? Yeah... I'm going toneed my socks! Come on, start it up! Wow! Alright. Hmmm. I thought the carwould run faster thanthat in the 8th mile? The Car willrun in the 5s. So what's the problem? Well, either there's somethingwrong with that clock or he's not gettingoff the line fast enough. Huh. Let's run it again. Well, it's not the clock. I can't get my feetto react fast enough. Naw, you're just having troublegetting off the starting line, that's all, everything else is fine. Well how am Igoing to fix that? I don't know. How about a handlever system? A what? Yeah they make something likethat for handicapped drivers. I checked into it whileyou were in the hospital. So he would have to start thecar, stop the car, and steerthe car all with his hands? Think you can handlesomething like that? Yeah. That could work. My legs are the problem. I don't think it will be aseasy as you think, but... Boys we've got ussome work to do. Come on! We're not goingto do it here. Give a littlegas there mousy Woohoo! What do youthink of that? That's it, that's it! Alright, cut it, cut it! Turn it off! Let's take itto the track. I don'tsee why not.

What kind of God takes a Dadaway from a 12 year old boy? You tell me that? Tell me that? If there was a God, why would he let me crash, leave me crippled, let someone shoot you? Come on, God's notrunning the show here... We are! We control what happens, it's our choices. And you need tostart seeing that, open your eyesand wake up. Take a lookaround you. God's a fairy tale.

A man whose heart gavemore love and happiness... Amen ...then hecould contain. Hey buddy. Hey. It's going to be okay. He would'vereally loved this. I wish I would've had justone more chance to say... I know. I just don'tunderstand. I don't think weever really do. I mean, why? Why doesthis have to happen, to Elli, my Dad? I should be theone dead not them. But you're not. You're probably just goingto say that's a miracle. I know this is going tosound crazy, but I... I think it's muchmore than that. There was a timeI had my doubts, but I don't anymore. Why is that? I think we're all herefor a purpose and... Eli served his. He spent most of hislife in a hospital bed. You're missingthe point. It's not about the time hespent in a hospital bed. It's about what hedid with that time. I saw Eli make people laughwhen they were crying. He changed them, He changed me! He changed you. His love was realand powerful... and greaterthan all of us. Eli always said thatlove comes from God. Do you thinkthat's true? I do, It's a kind oflove that never gives up. It's the kind of love thatEli and your Dad had for you. I want thatkind of love. What's holdingyou back? Okay. Okay. Morning Kiddo. Hey. Thanks forcoming back. Not a problem at all. Just takingone last look. You sure you're readyto do this thing? My whole life, I just didn't think Iwould get here like this. Did you ever see something likethis and think to yourself... If this is the lastbeautiful thing I see, It will bealright with me?

Should be quite a day, we'll see if he can handle the pressure. Speaking of guys that can handle the pressure, our Diane Godwin is with Johnny Lightneen. Hello with Diane Godwin and Iam live back on the track. Today we've seen manygreat races and it's almost time to find out who thisyear's new champion will be. Standing right next to meis last year's winner andtop contender, Johnny Lightneen. Why don't you tell us, what are you feeling rightat this moment? I mean you are on theverge of winning your nextchampion title, will Lightneenstrike twice? Well first of all it's veryexciting to be here again. Uh-huh. But you never can tellwhat's going to go on withthis kind of talent. He's cute. No, No, No. He is not ascute as Joseph! Oh and you're notbiased at all? Come on! So the wait is finally over, it is time for Shawn Baron vs. Joseph Jenkins, as Jenkins rolls his beautiful barracuda towards the starting line here at a packed Rockingham Dragway, all a part of the excitement here at Dragstock X, and this is where champions are made. This is where nerves take over and if you can manage those nerves and get past this round, the rest of the day could be just a little bit easier. Right now he makes his final adjustments. He'll get set to do his burnout. Here we go ADRL fans, make some noise. The burnouts are complete and Jenkins will purge the nitrous and get set to traverse the 1/8th mile here at Rockingham dragway. Jenkins is away green, they are both off green, Barron at the 1/8th mile stripe, it's going to be Jenkins running a 5.37 at a 129.05 mph. Now that's what Iam talking about come on. And the young man is moving on to round number 2 Next up it's going to be Jason Skynard taking on Jake Varner. Hey, this is the guy he isalways talking about. What the heck ishe doing there? And Skynard's away with a huge whole shot. He straps one on Varner at the finish line, it's going to be Skynard with the easy victory, he is moving on. I don'tlike that boy. The honey badger doing his thing right there and that is awesome man, to see that car. Team Alan Obye and that little mustang that's laid down the world's fastest record, recorded run.. Those trailersare huge man. We're doing it man, weare really doing it. Hey guys, Hi, Hey Lizzy. Nice run out there today. Hey not too bad yourself. Thank you.

We've got to goLizzy come on. I've got to go,I'll see you guys. Alright, see ya. Good luck out there. You too. Do you teachprivate lessons? Seriously? - That was good man.-Stop play'n. Jason skynard, how do you feelabout going up against him? To get into the finals? That's funny, you know, the whole season I've been keeping my eye onhim, I've watched him, he sort of came out of leftfield and he's doing real well, so I would say today is goingto be a very interesting time. So up next it's going to be Tony Cameron taking on Joseph Jenkins, will the dream weekend continue for Jenkins or will Cameron move on to the final round, we are just seconds away from finding out. All the stage bulbs are lit, the green light is down and... So Joseph Jenkins and his beautiful 67 barracuda go into the finals, but man you saw the puff of smoke fans, he has hurt that motor, no doubt in this announcer's mind, they're going to have to thrash between rounds, but none the less Jenkins going to the finals, the American drag racing leagues premiere event... Ha ha ha. Way to go Joe. ...Are you kidding me Trace check theintake and the heads. What's the problem? I don't know, I definitelyfound a loss of power.Here get me out of here. No, no, no, take a break. I'll check it out, you get focused. How do you feel about Joseph Jenkins? Joseph... uhm. I don't know reallywhat to tell you, except he's beenthrough a lot. Uhm, I've been very impressed with him and I'm very interested to see what he's going to do. And actually you know, If I was going to say anythingto him right now, I would say "Hey Joseph, God blessyou buddy, good luck". It's thehead gasket. Either that or thehead's cracked. How bad is it? I don't know I'm goingto have to pull it. How muchtime do we got? Not enough. Your lucky socks, do you got them? We've got a chance. Alright. See you back there. Alright, ADRL fans, who's it going to be taking on Jenkins in the championship round? Will it be Johnny Lightneen the defending champion and future ADLR hall of famer in his 57 ford thunderbird, or the young up start, Jason Skynard in his 66 Chevy too here we go. Man'o man what a heartbreak for Johnny Lightneen, he turns on the red light, which means Jason Skynard is going to the final round, Johnny Lightneen is going home. I don'tlike that boy. ...get through this top sportsman Al Tucci, we are going to bring in the original champion, dragstock back in 2004. This is it. Yeah it is, thanks for everything. You're welcomefor everything. Now go out thereand win this thing. You got it. Please tell meit's all fixed. Let's just say weput a bandage on it. Lie to me. It's all fixed. Good Job! So the traction twins putting the final touches on this track surface as we get set for our championship matchup. Is it going to be Jason Skynard or does the dream weekend come to the ultimate end, for Joseph Jenkins? They approach the water, it's burnout time at the rock. In the words of hall of fame announcer Al Tucci, "Beautiful smokey burnout!" Both stage bulbs are lit, Will it be Jenkins? Will it be Skynard? The tree comes down they're away and they're both away clean and green dead even off the start. Jenkins with a slight lead on Skynard No! No! Awww another huge puff of smoke again from Jenkin's car. Jenkins and Skynard are glued together at the finish line, who's it going to be? Who won? It's dead even, in all my years of doing this we're going to have to go to the 4 digit and triple zero margin of entry, we have no idea who won, we'll go to our assistant director of competition Leida Corzine, take a look at the computer printout. By one ten thousandth of a second, my voice is shot Rockingham Joseph Jenkins gets the win the dream weekend dragstock champion, can you believe it? Cheering Heavenly Father thank you so much for the family and friends around us, we love you and we pray for this food for the nourishment of our bodies and our bodies to your service. Amen. Amen, Very good Who wants some of this... Green beans. I thought my life was over, but it's now only the beginning. I found the rush that always satisfies. I discovered... It's not what you drive? it's what drives you.
