- Hi, thank you. - Hi, that's all right. If you could get changed, and then I'll see you for handover. All right, cool, see ya. See you downstairs. Thank you. I never really liked going to school, but one thing I enjoyed was physics. Newton's first law states an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line, unless acted upon by an external force. Hey, Katerina. Hi. Thanks for coming. How are you doing? Yeah, all right. - Feeling okay? - Yeah. Settling in all right? Yeah. Good, so maybe I want to speak to you about one of the patients in particular that we've got. Natasha Wong, she's got lung cancer with brain mets. Over the last 12 hours she's been quite breathless. She's had a fair amount of pain, and I think we just need to manage her expectations with regards to why she's here, and the fact that death is probably quite imminent. She also would really like to go home, so I think we'd have to ask the Medical Board if that was advisable. At the moment, it doesn't look like it. So, she's probably our priority patient at the moment. The others are in 12, 13, and 14, and then Natasha is in 18. - Is that all right? - Yeah. - That should be good. - Brilliant, brilliant. See you outside. See you around. Morning. Hi. How are you? All right, Lisa said I'm with you all day. That's nice! Did Lisa tell you that Ted is coming today. He's coming about 12 o'clock. Yeah, she mentioned it. 'Cause we have the meeting with Dr. Haner. Oh, do you? We wanted to talk about potentially me going home in the next few days. It's so weird, I've been feeling... Well, it's weird and it's not weird. I've been feeling so much better recently and miracles happen. So, I've decided I'm just gonna focus on what I want, and be positive. I feel like being here... It's really hard to stay positive. It's okay. I want children. I've got so much ahead of me, and I just feel here it's holding me back, and making me feel like I can't have that. It's like I'm fighting. I just feel like if I get out of here, I'll be able to focus on being positive, and look into adoption. I know I can't have my own children but maybe I can adopt. - You know? - Yeah. Yeah, so I'm hoping that Dr. Haner will help us to go on that journey. Okay. Natasha, first of all I gotta say I love your attitude. It's so important to stay positive, to do all of these exercises that you're doing. Honestly, it's so great. About going home, obviously it does have to go through the Medical Board, 'cause there is a possibility that you might not go home, at least not right now, anyway. So, do you want us to look into what can we do to give you the best quality of life... Do you want children, Katerina? Kids? Yeah. Yes. What would you like, a boy or a girl? If I could choose it sounds so horrible but I think a boy would be easier. Oh my God, me too! They're more fun, and we both, Ted and I want two boys. Two, God! And I think going home to prepare for all that, rather than being in here, feeling like I'm gonna die. I did notice when I walked in that you've got a new painting right here. That's actually a painting from a picture. I took a picture in South Africa. What? You have to go, it's incredible. The people are so nice and you know. I really want to go. I'm gonna go in to the doctor, and ask what he gave you this morning just to see see what you having in you already. And then maybe talk to him about getting you just a little something to get you through to lunch, if that's okay with you. Okay. Do you need anything else? Maybe, some more biscuits. It's that kind of day, we need sugar. Yeah. Okay, I'll see you later then. Okay, thank you, Katerina. Thank you. Hi. Hi. How are you doing? All right. You're from Norway, right? Yes, I am, hi, Katerina Nielson. Hi, I'm Miguel. Nice to meet you. I'm the IPU leader. Hi, nice to meet you. Listen, I'm excellent with all the work I do. It's best you come to me, if you need any advice with drugs, or where to go after work. That's good to know, and it's good that you know what you are good at. Yeah, actually I do. Thank you very much. You're welcome, Miguel. Yeah, Miguel from Spain where Rafael Nadal is from, pow! That's cool. Listen, I finish work at the same time as you today. If you need a partner for the bus, I have a spare Oyster card, and the local power, they know me. That sounds so amazing, but I think actually I'm gonna walk today. Yeah. It's all right. But, thank you, though, thank you. No problem. You're welcome. See you around. Bye. You again. Hey, Nick, how you are you doing? When are you going to shave? When it goes out of fashion. Come in. Hi. Hello. What are you doing? Just cleaning up in here. Where's Natasha? She's died. Oh. Okay. But she just seemed so fine two days ago. It sometimes happens. Okay, okay. Okay. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. Do you need to take five? Yeah, I'll just step out, just grab some air. Okay. Hey. Hi. How are you doing? Okay. First ones are never easy, you know? No, no, they're not. You'll get used to it. Will I? Yeah. You're allowed to feel. It's totally normal. If you didn't feel like that, you'd be in the wrong job. Yeah, that's true. She was young, wasn't she? Yeah. Way too young. It's a lesson for us. Get out there and live your life. You just never know. I'm Nick, by the way. Hi. I'm Katerina. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. Outside of a lift. Take your time. See you. The second he spoke, I remember having slightly more interest than I usually would with a stranger. My journal, where I go when I need to escape a little bit. And like a sixth sense, something awoke in my brain. I'll bring it back to you later. - Okay. - Thank you. Hi. Hey. What are you doing? I'm just taking a quick break. How are you feeling today? I feel a lot better. I was worried about you. Thank you. I was meaning to say that I've got a spare helmet, if you want to a have a spin on the motorbike, get some fresh air, clear the mind. Okay. I do actually have an Oyster card. Oh, the Oyster card. I realise that's really important in this place. Let's take a ride. Extremely important. If you change your mind, sort of want some fresh air. Yeah, okay. Have you changed your mind? Okay. What time do you finish? Same as you. I'll see you then. See you. Bye. I swear I wasn't looking for it. Was I? Thank you. You're welcome. Here. Why don't you just keep it? Okay. I guess I'll see you tomorrow at work then. Do you want to come in and have some water? Some water? Yeah. Sure. Cheers. Cheers. So what about you, mystery nurse? What's your story? My story? Yeah. What do you mean? Do you have any special someones in your life, or a wife, girlfriend? I was with someone for a while, but it didn't work out, so you know. Okay. Married, or? You ask a lot of questions. How old are you? I'm 25. Okay, I'm gonna leave. Why? Why, how old are you? I'm older than you. By how much? You're dangerous, you are. No, I'm not dangerous. This could get awkward. It's already awkward. Why, what? What are you doing? Nothing, apparently. I really should go. Come and stay, please. Okay, I should go. Why? Because we work together, and this is not a good idea. What are you so worried about? Come on, Nick, it's just you and me here. Come on, what's wrong? It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I gotta go. I'm gonna see you at work. Okay. Are you going? Yeah, I'm gonna go. Okay. Okay. Bye. KATERINA VOICEOVER: It's funny but I knew he would come back. What are you doing? I don't know. Hey. Hey. I didn't want to wake you. - I was just... - Oh no, it's fine. It's fine. Thanks for letting me stay. My pleasure. I don't think we should say anything at work. Okay. You know, one-night stands... Okay, I get it. Aren't you leaving? Yeah, I'm gonna leave. Okay. Bye. Okay. Okay, bye. I'm gonna go. I'm a friend of Katerina. We just... You're her flatmate? Yeah, this is my apartment. Nice to meet you. I should leave. Cool. Bye, then. - Bye. - Bye. I think it was the Italian in him. He would just show up at the door without notice. Want to go for a ride? Okay. His motorbike was very moulded into one. It was on the back that I discovered the power of energy. When were in sync, we leaned left and right as if joined by some invisible force in a quantum level. I hated rollercoasters as a child, but I was on the most exciting ride ever. Without being to strap in. Did you always want to be a nurse? I always knew I wanted to help people. Maybe travel the world. You're too normal for your own good, you know that? Why, what did you want to be? I used to dream about being a pilot when I was a kid. - Pilot? - Mm-hmm. Then what happened? I got my bike instead. You settled for a motorbike, now did you? I'm not sure I settled. I feel like I did something less fun. Well, it's a very pretty bike. It would be handy if you were a pilot. You could fly me to Africa. Hmm. I've got a day off on Sunday. I can go and get my pilot's licence. Hey! Let's do it. Yeah. Or we can go on the motorbike. We elope all the way to Africa. Oh, Elope, no! Okay. All right. You wanna travel, huh? Yeah, I do, one day. I am sure we will. I'm sure you will. - Stay here. - No, no. I need a drink. No, you don't. Goodness, it's 7 a.m. What was that? I said I miss you already. Say that again. Wow, you speak Norwegian. Okay, please stay, stay, stay, stay. Where are you always going? My days at work turned into anticipation of fun or where I will bump into him. I like that he won't tell anyone. It makes this thing, this game, more fun. He had a sensitivity that was easy to connect to. - Again? - Yeah, again. Come with me. This one's trouble. Hi. She's leaving. Until I started asking questions. Things seemed more important to him, more serious. Not something I was used to. This is where I come to think sometimes. It's a good place to get some peace and quiet. It's nice. Where do you go? I don't really have the need to go out and think too much. It's my Empire State Building. Okay. I think I prefer this over a skyscraper. You think a lot, don't you? You spend a lot of time inside your head. I try not to. You know that love when you can't stop thinking about somebody? When you're not with them, you just want to find them. When you're with them, time stands still. That kind of love. This is special. Katerina, this is really special. You make me feel alive. I haven't felt like this in a long time. I can feel my soul and it's because of you. Take the day off work. - No. - Take the day of work. No, no, I can't, no, no. No, no, no. No, I have to go. When are we going to do something together? Sure. Tomorrow? I'm gonna go away tomorrow. With me or are you going on your own? Just got to do something but I'll be back. Okay. My phone. Newton's second law states that the acceleration of an object is dependent upon two variables. The net force acting upon the object and the mass of the object itself. Nice to see you. Likewise. I had a feeling you would call. How have you been? Good. You look good. I feel really good. That's the longest time I've been away. Yeah. Do you miss me? I've got something to tell you. You can tell me. I've met somebody that I really like. What's her name? Katerina. Is that why you're here? Do you want my opinion about her? Happy for you. Does she know? You have to tell her, though, you know that, right? I feel like I have to tell you something, too. Okay. I'm pregnant. Are you happy with him? Yes. It's a girl. What are you gonna call her? I wanted to ask you if you were okay if I would call her Mia. Yeah. That's the only name I can think about. She came back. I am so happy for you. Thank you. He might find it hard at first. I know. I know. I know. I never thought we'd get here, two separate lives now. You know, I... I know what happened that makes you really scared. I hadn't seen you like that before. I couldn't imagine what it would have been like to raise a child with you being that way. I know you're fine but you have to tell her, though. I'll tell her when the time is right, okay? Nothing's happened in eight years. She's really young? She's younger, yeah. Is that easier? Maybe. I really like her. Are you still seeing your specialist? Are you not taking anything right now? I'm fine. I'm worried about you. It's always gonna be there, you know. I need to go. Oh no, don't. Don't say it. I missed you. Hey, what's that? I found it on the bridge. I think it might suit you. You really didn't. If I tell you the truth, you gonna take it? I'm not gonna take it. Here, take it back, take it back. I don't want it. It's really nice, take it. You sure you can afford it? Yes, so please take it. Thank you. How was work? Long. How are you doing down there? Sorry. Sorry, it's just Camilla. What's going on? Oh, we just started planning Africa. She's like texting me every five minutes. She is buying tickets and that kind of thing. I think you're gonna have a lovely time. I mean, you could come with, if you want to. I mean, Camilla would love it, she really likes you. Really likes me. Well, she doesn't dislike you. She doesn't know you. I can't, just I go other things going on. - I'm not sure... - What other things? You have your job, what other things? Come on, you never tell me anything. All I know is that you worked there for 10 years, and that you like playing football. You ever thought about getting married? Maybe one day. I'm wondering if this conversation is a little bit premature. Okay. Wondering if you are a little bit drunk. - Can we get some water, please? - Excuse me. This is my night off. Thank you very much. Excuse me, that is my wine glass, mister. We get a new bottle. Just for a minute, let's fantasise. I just tripped down the aisle, you're running away, going, I'm going to Africa. You're such a mess. Yes, I'm drunk. I can tell. And then tomorrow I'm gonna regret it, but right now everything's perfect. Okay. Don't tell anybody. Come meet me in the bathroom. You're insane. A little bit. Dream of Africa. Okay. He carries a mystery, an evasiveness. I ask about his past and there he stops. And he take a moment as if he's deciding whether he should tell me something or not. What are you writing? Nothing. I just saw my name. - Saw my name. - Sh! No, you didn't see your name. I saw Nick. Yeah, and Nick in Norwegian means none of your business in Norwegian. Go away, go away! This is mine, go to bed. I'm allowed to have secrets. Do you hate me? Yeah, that's exactly what I write: I hate Nick Caluzzi. God, I wish he'd get out of my bed. You see, I knew it. Gosh! I knew it. Leave me alone, I'm writing. What the hell are you writing? Go away. It's not fair, I'm gonna write in Italian. You go and do that. Buy your own journal, then. No, no, no, go to bed. I am busy! I'm gonna write in Italian. Can't do that. Okay, what does that mean? I'm not telling you. It's a secret. Oh, we keep it in secrets, now, are we? Today it all changed. I can't even write about it. I thought I was in control. And now I'm not. Is there anything I can do? Yeah. You can hold my hand. I had to protect myself. The truth is I was scared inside. And when that happens... I've learned to bite before I get bitten. What's going on? Nothing. It doesn't seem like nothing. Yeah, I'm fine. Are you sure? Yeah, it's fine. But I have to go home tonight. I thought you said you wanted to stay and watch a movie or something. Yeah, yeah, I was but Camilla just texted me and she needs to talk to me, so. What does she want to talk about? Why, do you have to know everything? Sorry, sorry, it's fine, okay. I just need to go home. She doesn't like me much, does she? Can you please not be so paranoid. She likes you fine. You're making fuss out of nothing right now. I just have to go home, okay? I don't think I am. Okay, now I just feel like you're causing an argument over nothing. I'm not even sure if it's me that's causing an argument. Yes, you are. I'm telling you I have to go home and you're getting all angry at me. I just have to go home and talk to my flatmate, okay? It's fine. Katerina. Yeah? I don't know what the hell is going on, but I'm here if you wanna talk about it, okay? Yeah, I know that. Look, it's fine, okay? We don't have to spend every second of the day together. Let me just go home and deal with this and then we'll talk later. Okay. Okay. Okay, I'll see you. Hi! - Hi. - Hi, can I sit here? Yeah, you can take a seat. Thank you. My bad, I'm thinking about life. That's okay. Hi, I don't we've probably met yet. I'm not sure, but I saw you just around, because I... It's crazy 'cause I've been here for like a month. I'm Katerina, anyway. Nice to meet you, I'm Luca. Well, that's a lovely name. Is that Italian? Yes, I'm from Italy. Oh, are you? Oh my God, it's amazing. I really want to to Italy. Actually, not from Italy, I'm from Venice. Oh Venice, I'm so jealous! I always say Venice. That's so cool. You started last month, did you say? Yeah, I'm fairly new still. All right, so. Okay. The observer effect. I changed reality just by the very act of looking at it. I hardly worry about mom anymore. Only when I talk to my sister do I remember what I left behind. I had to leave. I had no choice, I know that. I can only hope that... By leaving I'm setting a good example for my sister. I hope that she sees that if I can do it, so can she. At this point, I do suspect it's only her boyfriend holding her back. She won't move away from him. Now, you see a man holding you back. You okay? Yeah, you? Why are you trying to get a reaction out of me at work? What do you mean, I haven't. I haven't done anything. You're just being oversensitive. What? Are you seeing someone else? No. Nick. No, I have not been with someone else, but what the hell? What is wrong with you? But even if I had, it isn't like we ever said that we were together. Yeah, say something. I miss you. Don't do that to me, don't do that. This was just meant to be like a temporary thing, Nick. Now, it feels like you're changing. I can't do this anymore. I can't do this anymore with you. I'm not. Okay. Okay. Okay, good. This place is great, yeah? Can we have that drink? Can we get that drink, please? - Yeah. - Just the lime soda. - Yeah. - Cheers, man. Thank you. Is Camilla joining us anytime soon, or? Oh, she didn't text you? No. Well, apparently there's an emergency at your guys' hospital. I don't know, maybe, she'll be here later. Shall we? I definitely feel like we've been set up. - Camilla. - Camilla. She wouldn't do that, - would she? - No. She's great, though, I really like her. Yeah. So, how long have you been in London? I've been in London for six years. That's a long time. - Yeah, and you? - You like it? I'm just here doing my fellowship. I'm specialising in becoming a neurosurgeon. And you, where are you from? I'm from Norway, actually. - And you? - I'm from South Africa. You couldn't tell the accent. From Africa? Yeah, I'm from Cape Town which is like right at the bottom-southwest corner. It's quite a cosmopolitan European city, not really like real Africa. If you wanna experience real Africa, you need to kind of go a little bit north. So, Camilla said that you work in palliative care. Yeah, I'm a nurse, same as Camilla. Okay. Which makes me a surgeon, I guess? Being a surgeon can be tough. I mean, just getting there is tough. He was perfect, handsome, a surgeon. Everything you could ask for, really. Two years of internship afterward. But he wasn't Nick. Specialise. So, I came to the UK. Are you okay, 'cause you seem very distracted. It's just that I realise actually I have somewhere else to be. Are you sure? Hey, can I help you? I mean, is there something you need... - No, no, I'm fine. - Or do you need a lift? I'm fine, sorry, I'm fine. Thank you. Don't worry about it, I will sort it out. Thank you. Maybe, we could do this again sometime. - Yeah, maybe, maybe. - All right. What the hell? Hey, man, can I get another one of these, please? I miss you already. - Camilla. - Oh Jesus! You scared the hell out of me. I'm looking for Katerina. Do you know where she is? She's fine. She's just gone away for a few days. Can you tell her to call me when you speak to her? Sure. Yeah. Thank you. You know, it's just not that deep. Is that right? Yeah. Hi Nick. I ain't seen you in a while. I'll have vodka tonic. Double, single? Give me a double. Okay, mate. It's not working for me. How long have you been feeling this? Is that a serious question? You haven't brought this up. What was that the other day? Huh? You let your mom speak to me like that? I couldn't shout at her... You said nothing! It was all her friends were there. All the family were there. Do you know how that made me feel? You care more about what they think than I think. Don't worry about her. Like, you always fixate on what she's saying. You're like a seven-year-old when you're around her. It's ridiculous! Do you know what your problem is? - You're weak. - I'm not weak, just... Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. It's never the right time. Have you even told her that I don't want children. Look, I just don't think it matters so much about what she want wants rather than what we want for each other. Your family don't approve of me. They do, how many times have I said it? The thing is you don't come by yourself. You come with an army of freaking Iranians behind you. I find it pathetic. I understand the problem. Do you know what the problem is? Do you want me to tell you what the problem is? Oh, give him a break. I beg your pardon? I said give him a break! Nick, mate. Stay out of this, mate. Not today, mate, not today. You guys all right, sorry about that, yeah? Well, you haven't stopped her ever since the second I walked in the door. Oh my God, are you still speaking? Rein your neck in, we're having a private conversation. There's nothing private about your conversation. Just stay down, don't worry, he's drunk. I'm not drunk. Don't let him speak to me like that! Everyone can hear what you're talking about. Oh my God, he's a nutcase. I'm on your side, pal. Who are you, anyway? Just go away, you got nothing to do with this. This is not your issue here. I'm trying to have love, it's okay. No one asked to speak. Just stay down, I know, just stay down. Just stay down. It has nothing to do with you. - I'm on your side. - I know. Don't let him speak to me like that. - Here we go again. - This is my problem. There you are shouting at everybody again. You are off of your fucking head! Don't fucking call her that. I fucking had it! My God! Just calm down, just stay down. Call the police! Calm down! Just stay down, let's calm down. Pull him off, pull him off! Easy, easy, easy! You're all the same! You're all the same! Don't do that to me, though! Calm down, calm down, calm down. Let's have a walk, yeah. It's getting in his head. You're all the same. Nick, get out! Hey, man, have a seat. I'll get you a drink. He's a fucking nutcase and a fucking liability, that's what he is! Everyone at work is wondering what happened to... I won't call him. I can't because that might be what he wants. Hi, everyone, thank you for coming. I'm sorry I had to call this emergency meeting. I know it's the night shift and they're not our favourites. Nick Caluzzi, one of our senior nurses, he's gone missing. Well, he hasn't turned up to work for five days, so if you do know any information, or anything about Nick or his last whereabouts, then that would be brilliant if you could let me know. We just want him safe. We just want him found. If you could look at the board to see where his shifts are, and otherwise we'll get some agency nurses in. Of course, sure. Brilliant, thank you very much. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Oh God, I hope he hasn't had an accident. Where have you gone? The definition of entanglement is to be involved in a complicated situation and which is difficult to disengage. My rule was to keep my distance. I never thought that would backfire on me. You know I heard that they found Nick, that nurse guy, but they won't tell us where he is. They're probably not allowed to. I don't think he's coming back to work. I don't think he's allowed. I think something happened, maybe. I heard something. He's like a really weird guy. I don't think he spoke to anyone. Kept to himself. I never really met him. And I worked with him a few times. Yeah, really weird. As soon as I heard there was word, I knew exactly where to go. Miguel. - Hi. - Hey. Hi Katerina, what's up? Do you have a second to talk? Yeah. What's wrong? I heard you know where Nick Caluzzi is. What? I heard you know where Nick Caluzzi is. Can you tell me? You know I can't tell you that information. Why did you want to know? Because me and Nick have been seeing each other, and it ended badly, and he thinks I cheated on him, and I have to make it right. I knew something was going on. Please, I need to know where he is. Listen, I'm gonna go for a cigarette in a moment, and the door to my office is open. You can look in the filing cabinet. Okay? Thank you. No worries. As Newton's third law says, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Need help? Yeah. I'm here to see Nick Caluzzi. Are you a relative? No, I'm a friend, Katerina Nielson. You wanna come and sign in? Yeah. Come in. Here you go. Thanks. You okay? Yeah, yeah. I'm just a bit nervous. The last time I saw him it didn't end very well. I'm just not sure if I'm doing the right thing by coming today. You can come back another time, if you want. I have to see him. I get it. It can be really hard on the relatives. They often think it's something they've done. It's the illness, don't forget that. Within a week of taking his medication, he was much better. - Yeah? - Yeah. I don't think he should even be here, but he has to wait for an official discharge. Oh. How was he admitted? I can't tell you that. Patient confidentiality. Of course. Does he know that I'm coming? Okay. You ready? - Yeah. - Okay. Come on, I'll take you to him. You all right? Just give me a shout if you need me. How you been? I'm fine. What the hell happened, Nick? I ask myself the same question every day. Why didn't you tell me that you ended up in here? Why would I do that? Because you just disappeared. Everyone at work was really worried about you. Yeah, well, I'm sure they caught their shifts. Stop it. I'm still so angry. I can't shift in. I don't understand. You let me down. They said that I triggered an episode of bipolar. I thought I'd got over it a few year ago so I stopped taking my medication. And then this emotional reaction apparently triggered it again. Do I actually have to get into this? But you look fine to me. You shouldn't have come. I'm trying to get you out of my mind. I had to see where you were. I don't want you to see me like this. But you'll be fine. You just need to get out of here and you'll be fine. Maybe. Why didn't you tell me about this thing that you have? I didn't know. Embarrassed. I was scared. I was scared I was gonna lose you. Everyone has secrets, Nick. If I told you mine, you'd probably run away. Try me. Another time, maybe. Don't start that again. You play games. No, it's not a game anymore. It's probably for the best, anyway. It's not like I could have introduced you to my family. Too old? Too crazy. I mean, you have a certificate now and everything, don't you? I finally got a certificate in something. I'm joking. It's the motorbike thing they don't like. I'm gonna go in case you trigger another episode. Okay. I'm gonna go. It's what you keep saying. I'm definitely gonna go. You're gonna go now, yeah. I should go. You're gonna go. I'm gonna go this time. Okay. I'm glad you came. Yeah, me, too. I think he believed in love until he met me. I promise you, I'll make it up to you. Werner Heisenberg said, "It's a world "of potentialities or possibilities "rather than one of things or facts." The paradox is only a conflict between reality and your feeling of what reality ought to be. And in the end I believe that all paths lead home.
