One day can change your whole life. Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! For me, that day was July 10th, 1981. I love this song. I had just turned 18. Hey, it's too loud! No, don't touch it! These guys rock. Whoo! Oh, yeah! Yeah! You guys, I'm trying to drive! Whoo-hoo! Chug-a-lug! KC, you're spilling beer all over! Oops, my bad! Allison, my turn to steer. KC, take your hands off. That's not what you said last night. Come on, Allison, let him steer. It's not funny, KC Let go of the wheel! Quentin, tell him to stop. He's going to make us crash. Let's put the pedal to the metal, baby! - KC, stop it! - Whoo-hoo! Look out, Daytona! Whoo! Get your foot off the gas! KC, I can't steer! Oh, my god! Quentin, let's get out of here. Come on! KC, we've got to help him! KC, wait! Quentin, come back! Help! It was the day we killed Patrick Jason Connelly. Somebody, help! It was a death that took me away from Gilroy and a death that finally brought me back. Thanks so much for arranging everything. I'm sorry to have to have been the one to tell you about your grandmother, since we hadn't spoken in so long. You were such a good friend to her. Every time I called her, she would say things about all the great adventures you two were having. Oh. I'll be with you in a second, honey. Oh, OK. Hi, Allison. Marilyn? Hi. Sorry about your grandmother. Thank you. I didn't know that you knew her. Not very well. We went to the same church. She was there every Sunday, except of course, those two weeks that she went to visit you in Europe. Oh, yeah. Did you know I'm married now? I heard... Ray Baxter. Yeah. We have a son... Tony. He's eight. Congratulations. Yeah, Ray got another Hey, KC It's me. Jeremy, what's up? Looks like I owe you 50 bucks. You were right. About what? Allison Buchanan... she's back. You saw her? Oh, yeah. All right, don't worry. She'll... she'll be out of here soon as the funeral is over. What if she's not? I'll call Ray. Great. Allison, if you need anything, you can reach me at the hospital. I work in administration. Thank you. Bye. So have you been back to the house yet? Uh, no, I came straight from the airport. I'm going to head back there now to unpack. How long are you planning on staying? Oh, as long as it takes. As long as what takes? You know what I mean, Beverly. They ruined my life in more ways than I could have imagined. And I can't move on until the truth comes out. Allison, you... you have a life. You live in Paris. You're married to a successful chef. Jean Paul and I divorced four months ago. Oh. Honey, I'm sorry. Your grandmother never said anything to me. I didn't tell her. You know how much she worried. But you see, I can't even keep a relationship going. Look, what happened to you was a terrible thing, but sometimes it's better to let the demons from your past stay buried. Not when everyone else goes on as if nothing has happened. Jeremy Warner is head of the hospital now. KC owns the third largest auto dealership in the state. Yeah, he's now running for state senator. Politics... he'll fit right in. Look, Beverly, I know exactly what I'm up against. But now that my family's all gone, I promised myself that I would come back here and deal with what happened. Listen, why don't you come over to the cafe tonight after I close up? And then we'll talk over a coffee. What do you think? Well, thank you for the offer, but I've been on a plane for seven hours. I just want to go home and get settled. I'll call you tomorrow. OK. Thank you. OK, OK. Should've figured. License, please. Why'd you pull me over, Ray? Are you saying you don't have a license, ma'am? Long way from home, aren't you? Is there a reason that you stopped me, or are you just in the mood for a chitchat? I know you have a lot on your mind with your grandma's funeral home. And I assume once you get her things in order, you'll be mighty anxious to get out of town. Now, do I figure that right? Well, I just got here, Ray. Trying to get rid of me so soon? How long you plan on staying in Gilroy, Allie? Well, that depends. Depends on what? On how long it takes people to admit what really happened to that little boy. Those people have their lives built here, Allie. This ain't fun and games to them. And you think spending three years in prison for something I didn't do was a game, Ray? Losing my scholarship... my father getting cancer, and me not being able to see him before he died... you think that was fun and games, Ray? Allie, just calm down. I am calm. Believe me though, I'm not playing any games. Now, am I free to go? Take my advice, Allie. For your own sake, don't go starting any trouble. I'll keep that in mind. I'm done. Cleaned your plate... big boy. You can go play your video games, huh? All right! Don't forget to brush your teeth tonight. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Good night, Tony. Thanks, Marilyn. That was the best dinner I've had since... um... the last time you cooked. So what did the mechanic say about the car? Was I right? It was just the battery, huh? I didn't get a chance to take it in today because I went to Eleanor Buchanan's funeral. And how was that? It was a beautiful service... you know, very touching. Was Allison there? Yeah. Did you talk to her? Um, I didn't get a chance. Congratulations, Miss Buchanan. You have been accepted to Lansker University for the fall semester. I'm so proud of you, honey. You open that, I'm going to take away your keys. You've had enough. I just want to talk to Allison. I don't see the harm. Well, you should. Think of the ramifications for you and for everybody else. Besides, what do you think KC would say about it? I don't give a rat's ugly behind what KC would say about this or anything else! Hey, guys, Tony's upstairs. Lower your voices. Maybe we should talk about this when you're a little more sober. Oh, sure, Ray. You can't think of anything to back up your argument, you just accuse me of being drunk. Well, if the shoe fits... Ugh, I don't need to hear any more of this. What? What's the look for? Is there anything you don't do without KC's permission? Please, not this again. Ray, is this about what's best for your brother or what's best for KC? Mer, look. He's my brother. I love him. But he's not stable. Who knows what he'll do? I don't understand your inability to do anything except what KC tells you to do. It's ruining your relationship with Quentin... ...not to mention our marriage. Hello. Marilyn, it's KC Hold on. Speak of the devil... KC, what do you want? So? So what? So how's Quentin taking it? We all know how he felt about it in school. Are we going to have a problem, or what? No, there's no problem. He's... he just left. And he's, you know... you know he's right there with us. Oh. Knowing that's coming from you, puts my mind at ease, Ray. Because it's going to get awfully complicated for all involved if he's not. Don't worry. We're all on the same team. That's right. We are. All right, I'll see you tomorrow night. What's wrong? Come on, I can tell. What is it? Problem I dealt with 25 years ago has decided to rear its ugly head. How big is this problem? Remains to be seen, I suppose. Big enough to cost us the election? Possibly. Well, then we'll just have to take care of it, won't we? Why don't you come to bed and tell me all about it? Whoo-hoo! Thank you, Ray, for the brewskis back at home. Whoo! Oh, whoops! Quentin, tell him to stop. He's going to make us crash. Sorry. Hey, Allie, you need to chill out! He's just having a little fun. KC, I can't steer! Look out! Quentin, let's get out of here. Come on! - KC, we've got to help him! KC, wait! Quentin, come back! Help! Quentin? Oh, my god! Quentin! Quentin! Quentin! Ah! My head. Allie? Rough night? I've had worse. Yeah, couldn't be too terrible. It's a pretty nice boat you got here. It's not mine. I... I just manage the marina, and I watch this boat for some rich guy. Oh, I don't know what to say to you, even though I've played this conversation out 1,000 times in my head. Well, maybe you could start with an apology. I'm sorry, Allie. I never wanted any of that to happen to you. You were my best friend for god's sakes. So why'd you lie? Come on. I was a kid. I went along with the crowd. I did a lot of stupid things. Besides, it wasn't that simple, Allie. Sure, it was. You hung me out to dry so you could save your own ass. There is not a day I don't think about what we did to you and to that little boy. That's it? What do you want, Allie? I can't take back what happened! Just stop being such a victim, Quentin. There is something you can do. You can tell the truth. What? Now? Here. What's this? Ad rates for the Gilroy Sun. Full page costs $2,000, and I'll pay for it. Are you out of your mind? You're going to tell the whole truth, Quentin, about how we went down to the lake, and you and KC got drunk on the beer that Ray bought us. No. And you're going to say how I wasn't drunk. But that KC grabbed the wheel while I was driving, put his foot down on mine and the accelerator. And then after the accident, you and KC ran away and left me there, then got Jeremy to lie and say you were with him. You're going to tell it all, Quentin. No. Stop, Allie. Stop. That's never going to happen. It's something you should have done years ago. You were a kid then. You made a mistake. But that excuse doesn't wash anymore. You've lived with this lie for the last 25 years, Quentin. You could wake up tomorrow and never feel that burden again. Plus, I'm not leaving Gilroy till the truth comes out. No. That's not a good idea, Allie. Things could get real bad for you here. Oh, yeah? Well, you can tell them to rethink whatever little tricks they have up their sleeves because they won't work. And you... you're going to have to make a choice, Quentin. Quentin, what did she want? What, are you staking out my boat now? This is serious. What was she doing here? Nothing. I've got to go open up. Listen to me, little brother. You need to keep your distance. Don't let your feelings for her get in the way of doing what's best for everybody else. Fine. Quentin, KC called me last night. He's worried about where you stand. Screw him. KC can worry till he's blue in the face, for all I care. Just promise me you won't talk to Allison Buchanan anymore. And don't let her come on this boat again! And I should take that advice because? Because if you had one ounce of sense in that head of yours, you wouldn't even ask me that question. Just stay away from Allison. You know, if this ever hits the fan, I won't be there to save your ass. Dr. Lionel... Dr. Lionel, please pick up. Hi, I'm here to pick up my grandmother's things. Last name... Buchanan. Hey, Marilyn. Hi, Allison. Marilyn, I, uh... I just wanted to thank you for coming to my grandmother's funeral. You're welcome. Are you OK? Uh, yeah. I'm, um, just really busy. They go to you, didn't they? Let me guess. Ray told you to stay away from me. No, of course not. Marilyn, you might think you know what happened, but you don't. Dr. Allen... Dr. Allen, please report to the front desk. Thanks. I'm going to stay here, and I'm going to finish up some work, OK? No, it's not OK. Get your butt over here. I'll cover your losses if that's a problem. I can cover my own losses, Ray. Just listen... just listen. You can just tell those idiots they can play without me. Damn it, Quentin. Hey, guys. Sorry, I'm late. That's all right. Let's get this show on the road, huh? Ante up. Where's Quentin? Oh, some minor emergency at the marina. He's not gonna make it tonight. Probably just tired of losing. I don't think he's won a hand last three games. You know, I think you're right. Shame he's not here, Ray. I was looking forward to discussing our little problem. KC, there is no problem. I say, we let her run her mouth as much as she wants. She's just going to make herself look stupid. It's the same thing that happened 25 years ago. Nobody believed her then. Nobody's going to believe her now. Ray, that's not the point. Folks have had 25 years to forget this mess... not to mention all the people who've moved here since, who don't know anything about it... people who pay taxes and people who vote. Now, you really want her dredging all this stuff up, making accusations? You want her to tell everybody that Jeremy lied to the police about Quentin and I being with him that day, hmm? You want it to come out that it was you that gave us the beer? Wonder what the public would think of that? Think they'd want a sheriff that lies under oath, supplies alcohol to kids? Whatever she says, she has no proof. You think that makes a difference, Ray? The only thing that matters is what people believe. Now, there's no way I'll be elected if people buy into her story. And you don't think it's going to have a negative effect on his practice? He's right, Ray. That bitch can cause a lot of damage. Hi, guys. Hey, El. Hey, El. You're home early? You're one short tonight. Yeah. Quentin couldn't make it. Oh. Well, that's too bad. I hope he's not out for good. I'm sure he understands how important he is as a fourth for your game. Quentin wanted to be here. Trust me. Yeah. Not in the mood for poker tonight, or were you just uninvited? Allison? How did you get this number? Answer my question first. I wasn't in the mood. Now, why don't you tell me how you knew about the poker game. You think I'd come back here without doing my research? I hired a private investigator to keep me updated on all you guys. I know that the four of you play poker every Wednesday night and have been for years. That way KC can keep his eye on you. Well, it sounds like your PI did a pretty good job. You know, Quentin, maybe the reason that you decided to stay home tonight was because you wanted to think about what I asked you to do. We just don't think you're taking this seriously enough, Ray. You need to make sure that Allison doesn't influence your brother. She won't. Will you guys stop worrying? Can't take any chances, Ray. We all have too much at stake. You guys are driving me crazy. Are we going to play poker, or what? You know, the longer she stays in town, the more she's going to try to get close to Quentin. We've got to stop her. It's your bet. Their honeymoon's in France? How did you hear that? His fiancee stops in for a cappuccino every morning. Oh, for a cappuccino every morning? Uh-huh. What time? About 9:30. Oh. Well, I'll be coming in around that time tomorrow. Be great to see your beautiful smile. Oh, thank you, Beverly. - Drop by. - OK. We'll have a little chat. I'll see you tomorrow morning. Buh-bye, hon. Bye. Hello. Hello. Who is this? If you think that childish little games like prank phone calls are going to scare me away... Open the front door. Why? Just open it. No, I'm not going to! And I'm unplugging this phone, so don't call here again! They want you to look. Don't give them what they want. I am home. What's this? A little gift that was left at my door last night. These are the people you're protecting? You still think they deserve it? Allison... Allison! Right on time. Bridgette, that'll be just a second. Take your time. Good morning, Allison. How are you doing, hon? Oh, I'm fine, Beverly. What can I get you... your usual croissant? You bet. Allison, this is Bridgette. Bridgette is going to Paris for her honeymoon. Oh, congratulations. I just got back from Paris. I lived there for 10 years. We're going to travel all around Europe actually. My husband's going to take two months off from work. Oh. So who's the lucky guy? Jeremy Warner. The director of our hospital. Oh! You're engaged to Dr. Warner. Yeah. Do you know Jeremy? Yes, I do. Wow. I hope they let him out of the country for your honeymoon. What's that supposed to mean? Oh. I just meant that when the truth comes out about Jason Connelly, Jeremy is going to be in the midst of a media frenzy. Media frenzy? I have no idea what you're talking about. Here you go, hon. Thank you. Maybe you should ask your fiance. Hey, honey. Jeremy, who the hell is Jason Connelly? And why would you be involved in a media frenzy? Excuse me. Jeremy, what's going on? Well, she's gotten to Bridgette. We've got to deal with this now! All right. Tell me what's happening. Hello. Hello, Allison. Oh. Hello, Jeremy. What a surprise. I don't think so. And I don't appreciate you upsetting my fiance. You want to talk about upset lives, Jeremy? Look, I've been thinking, and I hope it doesn't have to be all or nothing with you. Maybe we could negotiate something. What do you mean? Just come and talk to me at the hospital. I mean, I can't get away today, but I can make some time here. How about around 4:00? OK. I'll be there. Great. Yeah, KC, what do you want? Allison is really starting to piss me off. Now, we've got to deal with this and deal with it right now. So listen up. She's going to the hospital at 4:00. Stop her and arrest her. Look, I don't like it, OK? But I'll do it. Make sure she never gets there. Hey, don't worry. There's only one way from her house to the hospital. Not again. Step out of the car, please. What? Allison, just do it. Ray, what is going on? Stay here and don't move. Ugh. I was just going to see Jeremy. Well, well, well, what have we here? You just put that there. Convicted felons are not allowed to possess firearms, Miss Buchanan. That is not mine, and you know it. And how would I know that? Looks untraceable to me. Serial number has been filed off. Guess you knew it was illegal. You bastard. Looks like a lot of laws have been broken here today, Allie. Sorry, you're under arrest. Once a liar, always a liar. Right, Ray? You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say, can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. I really don't need to read you your rights, do I? You've heard them all before. OK, turn and face the other way, please. Hold that. They kept the original deed to the house as collateral. The bondsman said that the bail wouldn't normally be this high, but because of your prior conviction. - Thank you so much. - OK. OK. What do you want to do now? Let's go get my car at the impound. OK. Hey, stranger. Hi, what are you doing here? Oh, Tony's friend invited him to go crabbing. Oh, yeah? I just dropped him off. Oh. How you doing? Well, not my worst days, not my best. You know how it is. How are things between you and Ray? Not our best days either. I'm sorry to hear that, Marilyn. Quentin, can I ask you something? What really happened with Allison Buchanan? I mean, what really happened? I'm saying that you should reconsider, Allison. Honey, what good would it do for you to go back to jail? They've taken so much of your life already. How can you let them take any more? I can't go on, knowing that I let them beat me twice. Well, let me tell you this, my love... it's not a perfect world, and it's certainly not a fair one. If I give up now, it means that what they did was acceptable. And it wasn't... not for me and not for Jason Connelly. KC grabbed the wheel, stepped on the gas, and I didn't do anything to stop him. So everything she said was true? Every word. None of it was her fault. Oh, my god. KC came up with this story that me, him, and Jeremy were all together that day... that we left Allie alone at the lake. The three of us guys went down to play football at the school. And we all told the police that Allie was alone in the car when it happened. We lied. I lied. We ruined her life, Marilyn. How do you get past a mistake like that? You'd sell your soul to take it back, but you know it's too late. You're right. It is too late to take it back. But it's never too late to make a difference, Quentin. I am so glad I fired that agency. Look at these comps. These new guys are so much better. You're right. These are good. This one's nice. So what happened? Did it work? She used her grandmother's estate to post bail. That's to be expected. But don't worry, she'll give up. This isn't worth going back to prison for. I hope your instincts are right on this one. Aren't they always right? Hey, Allie. You're wasting your time, Quentin. If a bogus arrest can't run me out of town, there's nothing that you're going to say... Just hang on, hang on. What bogus arrest? What are you talking about? Ray planted a gun in my car and arrested me. What? I'm out on bail. I can't believe they'd go that far. Look, Allie. I didn't come here to force you to leave. All right. Then what do you want? I came to tell you that I'll do it. What? The newspaper article... if you write the confession, I'll sign it. You know, I wanted to come and see you when... when you were in prison. Then why didn't you? I don't know. I just couldn't. You were my best friend. How could you do that to me? People do stuff when they're scared I guess. I can tell you, there isn't a day I haven't thought about you and wondering where you... where you were, what you were doing. What made you change your mind? Because things haven't been easy. Gina divorced me because of my drinking. Got a daughter I haven't seen in four years. I lost the house last November. Ray pulled a few strings and got me the gig managing the marina. I mean, I just want to do one thing right for a change... one thing. You know, we both know KC is an all-around jackass... pretty much always has been. But I also know that I betrayed you worse than he did. You meant more to me than anyone in the world. When you needed me... when it came time to protect you... I let you down. I know I can't change the past, but maybe I can give you a future... the one you deserved all along. You know, when we were kids, I kind of got the feeling that you sort of liked me. But you never said anything. How come? Uh, I don't know. I don't know. You were dating KC I mean, he was Mr. Popular. I guess I just thought you wouldn't go for me. I did write you a few letters and a really silly poem, but they just ended up in the trash. Things might have been really different if I'd just had the guts to do the right thing... tell the truth before it got too late. Well, you're doing the right thing now. Hey, I'm glad I caught you. Actually, I was just going to run some errands. That's all right. I just wanted to give you a cheque for the slip rental. You could've mailed it. You're right, I could have. But I wanted to see you in person. Been kind of worried about you, Quentin. That's very thoughtful of you, KC And I wanted to let you know I feel terrible... I really do... about what we did to Allison. I can tell. What I'm trying to say is we can either stand together... you and I... or we can let that bitch take us down together. And that I'm not going to let happen. You may be able to strong-arm my brother into arresting Allison, but you are not going to tell me what to do! So I'd appreciate it if you get the hell out of here. Don't do something you're going to regret. Look, KC, all four of us committed perjury. We could go to jail for years if she convinces a jury we set her up. With Allison being arrested, we have ruined any credibility she might have had. True, but if she's convinced Quentin to back up her story, then we're screwed. What if she had an accident? End this whole thing, once and for all. Killing Allison is a last resort. It's going to look pretty damn suspicious if she dies now. Fine, then come up with something. I mean, you're the one that came up with all the ideas so far. Actually, they were my ideas. And KC's right. Killing her is too risky. No... Quentin is the only wild card here. But what about Ray? Don't worry about Ray. We'll handle him. We always do. All right then. What's the plan? I know exactly what we have to do. Dear Citizens of Gilroy, there is something that I need to confess to you. Almost 25 years ago, a teenager named Allison Buchanan was arrested for vehicular manslaughter in the death of Jason Patrick Connelly and sentenced to five years in prison. She served three. But Allison Buchanan was innocent. No one else was charged because everyone believed that she was the only one at the scene, but that wasn't true. I was there, and I'm going to tell you exactly what happened. Yo, Quentin! You here? Hey, Quentin! I need some diesel. Oh, Quentin. Please don't get cold feet on me. Thank you, Doctor. OK. Hello. Uh, yeah, I'm calling for Quentin. Allison, it's me, Marilyn. I have his cell phone. He's in the hospital. What? What happened? He was drinking and had an accident last night. They think he fell and hit his head. The doctors induced a coma. He's in ICU. Oh, my god. They don't know if he's going to make it. I got to go. Marilyn... Marilyn? Who was that? Oh, just someone from the marina. They wanted to know how he's doing. It's not Ellie's fault. I mean, some moron shows up and decides to call an ambulance. The point, Jeremy, is that we are worse off now than we were before. Quentin saw Ellie. They're monitoring his ICP. If it doesn't drop by tonight, they're prepared to do surgery on him tomorrow. Yeah, OK. So what are the chances that he is going to recover? That can't happen, Jeremy. You understand? Yeah. Allison. Well, well, what a surprise. Been such a long time. Shame we couldn't have met under better circumstances. Well, it's pretty convenient that Quentin has an accident now. Isn't it? Come on. Is that any way to greet an old friend? I think you had something to do with it. Here we go again. You should know, Allison, accidents do happen. You look good. How is he? You really shouldn't be here. Ray, please. I just came to see Quentin. Sorry, you can't see him. They're not letting anyone in right now... not for a couple of hours. Can I talk to you, Ray... privately? Now's not the time. This is important. It's about Quentin. We can talk back here. Look, I... I don't think that Quentin got drunk and fell. I think he was attacked. Why do you say that? Because he came over to my house yesterday and said that he wanted to admit everything. He was supposed to meet me this morning and sign the confession for the newspaper. I mean, it's just too much of a coincidence, you know. I mean, KC knew that even if people didn't believe me, they would believe Quentin. Look, Ray, don't let him get away with it. This is your brother that we're talking about. You owe it to him to investigate what happened last night. Look, I hate KC as much as anyone, but, Allison, do you really think he's capable of murder? KC is capable of anything. But then again, you know that. Don't you? Ray, did you hear what she said? What if KC really is responsible for what happened to Quentin? Mer, I'm a cop. Unlike Allison Buchanan, I can't go around accusing people without any proof. Oh, you are unbelievable! So you're not even going to investigate it? That's it, Ray. I need you to tell me what this thing is between you and KC I can't. What do you mean, you can't? It's better if you don't know. Then Tony and I are leaving. You're not the man I married. Mer, you don't understand. That's right! I don't understand. OK, then... OK, then you will. Two years ago, remember when my mom was in the hospital right before she died? Well, her insurance ran out. And the bills... there was no way that she could pay them. And right about that time, we busted this drug dealer over in Catonsville. Yeah, I remember. Mer, that guy had $50,000 in cash in his house, and I took some. Oh, Ray. It was there. It was drug money. And I needed it. Guy's wife figured it out, turned me in. KC... KC knew some people. Internal affairs looked the other way. Mer, I would've lost my job... probably would've gone to jail. I, uh... I owe KC But please, please don't leave. I love you. You and Tony... you're everything to me. Sorry to do this to you, Quentin. But we can't take any chances. And these medication mix-ups happen more often than you'd think. At least, you won't feel a thing. After Quentin died, everything felt different. It was as if Gilroy was nothing more than a deep dark hole that swallows people up. Some people went on with their lives like nothing happened. And for some, their lives were better. As for me, well, part of me wished that I'd never come back. But the bigger part of me wanted justice more than ever. I'm sure KC is involved. And if Ray won't investigate, then I will. I'm going to start putting together all the information about Quentin's death. Will you help me? What do you want me to do? You have access to medical records, right? Uh-huh. I need a copy of Quentin's file and a list of all the hospital staff that worked that night. OK. I do know one of the nurses really well. She was on duty, working the graveyard shift, when Quentin died. Think she'll talk to me? Maybe. Allison, I want you to know that Quentin told me everything that happened that day. He felt so guilty. He... he cared a lot about you. I know. How's Ray? Not so good. I am so sorry. Quentin was a lot like Ray. Yeah, they both made their share of mistakes, but I believe they were good in their hearts. What happened to us, little brother? What happened to us? We can't, Jeremy. I don't think we have a choice. She's been hanging around the hospital all day. She was talking to Marilyn earlier. And now, she's chatting it up with Quentin's nurse. All right, come over to my place. We'll discuss how to deal with this. I don't see the problem, Jeremy. You're sure this will work? Yes. All you've got to do... you pack her bags like she got out of town. Boom. But what if Marilyn questions... So what if she does? There's no body. There's no proof. Now, Bridgette... is she going to wonder where you went? No, she's driving up to DC for a few days to visit friends. So there you go... no worries. By tonight, all our problems will be solved. All right, you better go. I'm going to keep asking questions. I don't care if I have to talk to every single employee in that hospital. I'm going to get to the bottom of Quentin's death. Well, you know this is going to be an uphill battle, don't you? I know, Beverly. You're right. All right. Well, don't be up all night, OK? Yes, I will get some sleep. Take care of yourself. You too. Good night, hon. Good night. Hey, Ray. I need to talk to you. Sure. Come on in. Drink? No, I don't want a drink. I need to know that you had nothing to do with Quentin's death. Why would you even say something like that? I'm requesting an autopsy, KC. If anything turns up that makes me think that you or Jeremy had anything... They won't find anything, Ray. I told you, Quentin died because he slipped and fell. That's it. He was my brother. I understand that, and I sympathize with your loss. I do. Yeah. Well, I'm going to sign Allison's confession for the newspaper, let everybody know what really happened. OK, Ray, that is a really bad idea. For your own good, you might want to let that go. Sorry. It's what my brother would have wanted. Quentin is dead. So as long as you and your little wife can keep her mouth shut, things are going to go on pretty much as they always did. And what about Allison Buchanan? She's not about to stop either. Oh, I disagree. I think Allison knows she's in over her head. Yeah. Hey, KC. It's me. Everything's going as planned. I packed her bags, and we're heading toward the farm. All right. You know when to call me. Sure do. That Jeremy on the phone? You up to something, KC? Don't be so paranoid. Then where is he? What's he doing? What, am I his nanny now? You know, I don't know who or what you are anymore. I think you better stick around, Ray. Get your hand off me. Listen. I said get your hands off me! That's enough, Ray. Step back. Oh, I'd do it. I told you this would happen, KC... just like his brother. No, no, no. He's not like Quentin. He understands we're on the same team, always have been, always will be. Have a seat, Ray. You didn't hear the lady? She said have a seat. To pass the time. Come on, buddy. Deal us a hand. You ever heard of solitaire? Suit yourself, Ray. So what's the plan, KC? Another accident, another slip and fall? I told you... I had nothing to do with Quentin. The less you know about Allison, the better. You're never going to get away with this. How's Marilyn, by the way? You leave her out of this. This has nothing to do with her. I don't think she was implying that it does. I worry about Marilyn though. Didn't you mention she had some sort of car problem? If anything happens to Marilyn or Tony, I swear I'll kill you. Sit back, Ray. Don't be so melodramatic. You have the power to save them from any harm. It's your choice. You're right. You're right. It is. So what are we going to do? You're going to keep me here all night? Where'd Jeremy take Allison? Relax, Ray. Take it easy. In another hour, you're going to be back at home with Marilyn, and everything's going to go back to the way it always was. Unless you don't want it that way. No, he does. Right? Come on. Deal us a hand. well, I'm due for a refill. Want a drink, Ellie? Sure. Get over the couch. You got three seconds to tell me where Allison is. You're not going to shoot me, Ray. I will if you don't tell me where Jeremy took her. It's too late, Ray. It better not be, for your sake. Tell me, KC, or I will shoot you. This is badge 5283. Go ahead, sheriff. Yeah, I need backup at 10 Ridgeley Street. And send paramedics. There's a suspect that's been shot. 10-4. Do you want to play this game? He's bluffing. You think I'm bluffing, KC? You're a gambling man. Call my bluff. I think you're bluffing. Don't move. Ellie! Shh. It's OK. It's OK. I'm with you. Where's Allison? I don't know! Your choice. Too bad Ellie's going to be a widow. He took her out to the woods. The woods where? The old Fenton farm! Give me your cell phone. Give me your cell phone! Slide it over on the floor. Hey, KC. It's Ray. KC and I are on our way out to see you. Oh, hey, Ray. That's good. I could use your help digging. This hole's a real bitch. Where are you exactly? Just take the back road up to the Fenton place. I've got the car hidden in the barn. Is she did? Not yet. Good, because KC wants a word with her. So just hold on till we get out there. Sure. You, you better hope and pray she's OK. Damn... gloves. Oh no. Damn it! Damn it! You can't get away, Allison. No! Sh! Sh! Stop it. Stop it. I'm here to help you. God, you don't know how glad I am to see you, Ray. So what's going on? Man, you have no idea how ready I am to kill this bitch! Just calm down. Where's KC? Still in the car. I thought you two were... together. Not anymore. Change of plans, pal. Oh, don't play the hero now, Ray. You need the past to stay buried just as much as we do. Too late. It's time to tell the truth. This has gone on way too long. KC and Ellie were already arrested. I'm not going to jail, Ray. Put your hands behind your head, and get on the ground, Jeremy. I said I'm not going to do jail, Ray! And I said get on the ground now. Do it! You're going to have to shoot me first. I will if I have to, Jeremy. Jeremy! Freeze! You OK? Yeah. Yeah, I'm OK. Coming! Ray. Hey. Hi. Oh, come in. Um, no. Thanks. I... I just wanted to come by to give you this. Quentin's class ring. Yeah. Thank you. I think he would've wanted you to have it. So what are you going to do now? Oh, spend a lot of time with my lawyer looking for a job. But most important, Marilyn and I, I think we're going to work things out. Good. Yeah. I spoke to the DA about getting your record expunged. Oh yeah. He called me, and he said he didn't think it would be a problem. That's good. Good. I can't say the same thing for KC, Jeremy, and Ellie. They're all blaming each other, trying to bargain with the DA. Can't say I'm surprised. They always were good at backstabbing their friends. Yeah. Well, unfortunately, so was I. Allison, I'm sorry. Thank you. If you ever need anything. You take care of yourself, and good luck. Ray. Yeah? Your brother would have been proud of you. I'd like to think that. You know I'm going to miss you. I'm going to miss you too. Thanks for everything. Are you sure you don't want to stick around here a while? Oh, I'm sure. Oh. You know, for the first time I feel like I can really leave Gilroy. Yeah. Give me a hug. 25 years ago, one day changed my whole life. But I guess you never know when that day will come again.
