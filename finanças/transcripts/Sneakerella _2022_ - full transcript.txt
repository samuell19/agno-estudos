[person] Not all fairy tales begin in a land far, far away. Ours begins right here. Do you recognize it? It's home to many kings and queens, though they don't all wear crowns. A land of possibility and opportunity. Though for many, these dreams can feel as far away as a castle in the clouds. Once upon a pair of sneakers, far from the gleaming towers of this kingdom, there lived a special boy who was full of kindness and creativity. Like many in this town, he grew up believing in the idea that the perfect pair of kicks could make him fly, make him soar. And, with his head full of sketches and his heart full of hope, he held tight to these dreams, no matter how hard the world around him tried to keep his feet on the ground.

There's a million things going on right now, and I honestly don't know how to get you to focus. Come over here. The shelves need dusting, and straighten up in the back. And clean off the counter with all your mess. Please. - Wait. - [Stepfather sighs] Don't I have the day off? I thought Stacy and Zelly were working today. Yeah, I'm fully booked. I've got a future venture capitalist meeting. - It's kind of a big deal. Yeah. - Impressive. - See? - [Zelly grunting] But I... I kinda had a thing... [Zelly] Yeah, I'm busy too. [grunting] Whoops. - Sorry. I have judo practice. - And clean that up too, El. Look, I have a very important dinner meeting with a customer. I wanna bring them here after, so this place has to be spotless by 7:00. - Okay... - Listen. You hear what I said? - I... - By 7:00. No more distractions. - But can I... - [door opens] Really? Sami's waiting for me. I told you I had the sneaker drop today. [Stacy] And we told you we had real lives. - Sorry. - Sorry, dude. - Wow. - Next time. [phone ringing] - Hey, Sami. I... - [Sami] Yo, dude, where are you? - You're gonna mi... - Bye, Sami. - No distractions. - Can I just... - [boys cackling] - Let's go, boys. - See ya. - "No distractions." - [Zelly singsongy] Later. - [Stacy] Bye.

Yeah, so did I. So did I. Oh, step Vader strikes again. I swear, that guy... - Come on. We're gonna be late. - [grunts] - We're already late. - Oh, watch out! Watch out! - Whoa. Whoa! - [El] Sorry, Gustavo. [Gustavo groans] [Sami] Sorry, G. - Hey, you need help with this? - Yeah, gracias. Dude, we gotta go. Come on. We're already late. Like you said. Gustavo, I know you're strong, but this is not a one-man job. Okay? - [Gustavo] That's why you're here. - [groans] [birds chirping] Wow. [Gustavo] Over by the tomato patch, por favor. [Sami] You know, this is a lot of dirt for one guy's tomatoes. Well, it's my job to tend to anything around here that needs a little extra love and assistance. Big or small. Ah, Gustavo! Come on. See you rocking them Tailwinds. Crispy. What can I say, eh? [Speaking Spanish] They suit me, don't you think? All right, you feeling yourself. Your mother always knew exactly what I needed. A great talent. She always picked the perfect pair. Yeah. She did. Eh? Why don't you come visit sometime? Help me keep her flowers blooming? - Yeah, uh… - [whispering] Come on. Come on. Come on. Wrap it up. [Gustavo] Like Rosie, we are always here for you. You know that. Uh, G, we are super late. - Yeah. So sorry. - Like, so...

Darius King's rookie sneaker is about to be ours. You see the updated gray colorway, right? Space gray? - The shape, the material… - Oh, my gosh. It's butter! So butter. It's butter. This drop is about to be epic. Butter, butter, butter! There's no better word. These shoes will change our lives. I brought my half. You get yours? Mm-hmm. Sold my Air Max 97s to my girlfriend. "Girlfriend." Which one? Hmm? You got, like, ten of them. Listen, you gotta kiss a lot of lady frogs before you find a princess, okay? - Well, until then, you're stuck with me. - Mmm. Least your kicks are. I don't care if I have to wear 20 pairs of socks to share these shoes with you, as long as I can retire these bad boys, I'll be happy. - [El] Let me at them. - [Sami] You can't clean them. - I already tried. Stupid fingerprint. - Let me at them. Come on. Welcome to the factory. Oh, no. [whispering] Don't kill me. El, you're scaring me. Good. What did you just do to my sneaker? Oh, I... I was trying to... Dude, I love it. Do the other. Okay, um… Okay. - Hold very still. - Okay. And boom! [Sami chuckles] - [growling] - [Sami laughing] Stop! This is the hottest crime scene I have ever worn. Yeah, they'll do. - [Sami laughs] - Sami. What are you doing? You are just very talented. We could still use this money on materials for you to make us your own pair instead. What... Don't... Remember the first pair you made in the sixth grade? - I swear your mom was ready to call Nike. - Sami, I don't do that anymore. But you could. Look, you flipped your kicks for a pair of real sneakers. All right? From a legit designer, not your best friend. You are a legit designer. What makes someone legit anyway? Sami, when's the last time you actually saw me make a pair of sneakers? I just scribble in my notebook. That's it. Mmm. That's funny. I think I hear your stepfather talking, not you. Is he wrong? Is he wrong? Hmm? I'm a stock boy. That's it. All right? And not a very good one at that. Meh. Ooh. Come on, come on, come on. Thank you. So, how did you convince the overlord to let you go today? I might have locked up without telling him. [Sami] Bold. If we get back in time, he won't know the difference. [music playing] Okay, I think he's gonna know the difference. [El] "Made to soar." Can we? [laughs] [Sami] Let's go get it. [El] Oh… [Sami] Oh… I wanna lick 'em. [El chuckles] All hail the King. Okay, but, look, if you are gonna be in a hurry to get back, I'm wearing them first, 'cause what you're not gonna do, is scuff our brand-new kicks on the very first day, okay? - Sneaker prenup rule number... - Oh, my gosh. Whoa, hold up. Where did you get those King6 shoes? They almost look like Sleeks. - Are those player exclusive? - Oh, uh… [customer 1] Yo, cutters! Line's back here. - [customer 2] Yeah, man. - [customer 3] Get back in the line. - No. - [customer 1] Hey, cutters! Yo, I'm never making it back to work. - There's like a thousand people. - [groans] I can see that. - Next group, come on up. - Let's go. - Keep moving. - No, dude, we can't... I... - [customer] Yo! The line's back there. - Okay. Do I need to pull up and personally make it clear to you? - It's okay. We're... - Oh, hey. Coz. I'm so glad you found me. I've been waiting for you. - Y'all cappin'. - [person] Nobody's cappin'. - This is our cousin. - Yeah. Nah, th-these are my cousins and see, - I've been saving our spot in line. - Yeah. - We're family. - So, thank you. - Thank you. Bye. Have a good day. - [Sami] Thanks. [customer 1] Whatever. You know they not. [customer 2] Can we call security? This is messed up. Hey. That was really sweet. Um… Um, I'm Kira. El. Hi. I'm Sami. I'm not a part of this, so… That's my friend, Sami. - Hi, Sami. - I just said that thing. Hi. - [El] I'm sorry. - I mean, I appreciate the save. Yeah, of course. I mean, guy's a total hypebeast, right? He deserves to be cut in line anyway. - I think he's just amped up. - Nah, what do you mean? I mean, you saw his Zebras, right? [Kira] Yeah. You see how the knit upper gets darker just as it meets the boots? It's wet. He probably scrubbed those shoes down this morning. - [Sami chuckling] - He prepped hard-core for this drop. - Wow. I can't believe you noticed that. - [Sami] Well... El believes that sneakers are a window to the soul. Kinda like a mood ring. To the soul? - Show her. - No. - It's this trick he does. Really cool. - It's not a trick. It's this thing that his mom taught him... - Stop. - What did your mom teach you? He's a sneaker psychic. - Okay, El, I have to see this now. - I'm sorry. It's really nothing. Hmm. Come on. Show me what you got. Okay. Okay. All right. Um… Check out that dude. See him? - Yeah. - [El] Okay, um… Sporting a classic. Thinks "if it ain't broke, don't fix it." Can't go wrong with the GOAT. Stable, reliable, good taste, gives you Christmas gifts that are actually on your wish lists. Puts some cash in your birthday card. Hmm. Not much of a psychic. You could say that about anybody and how would we know? Kick it up a notch. All right, check her out. Hot pink kicks. She got the colorful base, but she had to go and heat it up with the laces. She's fearless. She laughs in the face of fear. No way she walks around that busted grate. Are you joking? I don't know. No New Yorker steps on those grates. Yeah, my money's on the sidewalk. [gasps] - [El] Voilà! - Oh! You are amazing! You're amazing! You are a sneaker psychic. - Sami, you weren't lying. - I know. [El] No, I'm just... You gotta pay attention. People are telling you a story about who they are. That's what a perfect pair of sneakers is. At least what it can be. You know, you just gotta give somebody a chance to be real, right? - But, by your logic… - Uh-huh. …why would all these people then line up to wear the same shoe? Mmm. I... I guess if you put enough of yourself into a design, it's gonna hit. But at the end of the day, once I slip on that sneaker, it's my story. [employee] All right. Sorry, everyone. We're officially sold out of the Forum sneakers for this drop. - [all groaning] - Thanks for coming. - [Sami] Do you see that guy? - [El] Did you really need four pairs? - Are you... Is that necessary? - You have two feet, man. Can I get one? This is the worst day of my life. I don't know. This is the most fun I've had talking about kicks in, well, ever. Yeah, I mean, this is, like, the most fun I've ever... We... W-We're so in sync right now. I mean, it's very... very fun. I... - Stop. - Huh? I think what he's trying to say is it's really nice to meet you. - Yeah. - Hey, hold up. I thought you said she was your cousin. Yeah, we are cousins. We're family. It's like a family reunion. Because... - [El] You have friends. Okay… - So what's up? I have an idea. Hey, how about... How about we, uh… - [both] Run! - [Kira screams] [El] Run! Hey! Sorry, excuse me. Come on. Let's go! - [Sami] Sorry, get out of the way! Move! - [customer 1] You ain't gonna get away! - [El] Whoa. Go! Go, go, go! - [customer 1] There they are! - Out of the way! Let's get 'em! - [customer 2] Yo, what? Save yourselves. I got wheels. - [Kira] Bye, Sami! - We gotta go. [customer 1] I see them! Yo, get 'em. - They're still behind us. - Wait. Up for an adventure? Come on. - [customer 1] They're getting away! - [customer 2] Run! Yeah. [announcer] Stand clear of the closing doors, please. Get 'em! Yo, what the... Yo, come on. - [El] Adios! - [customer] You should be running! [Kira panting] Whoa, wait. Where are we even going? - We're going to Queens. Come on. - [Kira] Queens? You know, when you said "adventure," I thought you were gonna show me something, I don't know, new? Oh, so you've seen everything, huh? [laughs] Maybe. What?

Hey, I recognize it. I can see that from our apartment. You're a city girl, huh? Okay. Well, I bet we can get you a closer look. Follow me, Manhattan. [Kira laughing] Okay. Be careful, okay? Okay. [El] The legendary Astoria graffiti wall. It's always evolving and changing. You know, it's kinda like this city. Everyone gets a chance to express themselves, and now it's your turn. Thank you. I don't know what to do. Spray whatever you're feeling right now. Anything. Let's see what you've got, Manhattan. Oh, word. That's how you feel? Hmm. That's, uh… - I'm confused. - [Kira chuckles] - Turn around. - Hmm? - Made a frame. - Ah. If the wall is always changing, I wanna make sure I can always remember what it looks like right now. Cheese. [camera clicks] You know, my dad grew up in Queens. - Really? - Yeah. I mean, he talks about his roots a lot, but I can't even remember the last time he set foot around here. Well, if he needs a refresh, apparently I'm also a tour guide, so… I'd give you four stars. What? Come on. Look at this? Come on! How is this not five-star material? Maybe add in some more sneaker readings, and I'll consider bumping you up. Okay. It's never enough, never enough for Manhattan. I get it. I get it. Well, Sami said that your mom taught you all that. Is it true? Yeah. She, uh... She did. Before she, uh, passed. It's kinda why kicks mean so much to me. It's, like, the only part of her I have left. I didn't realize. - I'm really sorry. - It's okay. It's okay. You know… I miss her. But every day she's with me. Every time I slip on my kicks. That's a pretty cool legacy. I mean, my family is full of sneaker junkies, but I don't think any of them see kicks the way you do. In fact, will you help me with something? For you, Manhattan, anything. Okay. What do these say about me? Uh… And don't go soft on me now, okay? I can take it. They... They don't really say anything. I mean, they're not bad. They're... They're just a little… - Basic. - Hmm. You know, just a little more basic than I would assume from King. I'm sorry. So you're saying I'm basic? No. No. No, I didn't mean it like that. I just mean, you know, the shoe... Y-You deserve a... a one of one. Uh… [stammering] - What? - Nah, you're right. You should've seen your face. It was so funny. You're right. They are basic. And I was worried about that because I am not basic. So, if you were worried they weren't fresh, why'd you cop them? Is that, like, a Manhattan thing? Y'all do that up there? It's a life thing. Because sometimes you gotta try something out and hope it surprises you. Today, I tried out these kicks, and they didn't. - No. At all. - No. No, not this time. But today, I also tried going on an adventure with you. And… Are you surprised? Yeah.

Right? - Didn't I tell you that? - Yes. And what did we find? What? Huh? A dark store, locked door. [scoffs] Totally unimpressive. - And totally embarrassing. - I... This is the real world, El! Not some doodle or some nonsense you're dreaming about. Okay? The real world. You've got to get yourself right. [sighs] El, I honestly don't get it. You weren't disappearing and acting up when your mother was here. She didn't use me as a stock boy. Okay? And you never even yell at them when they stick me with their shifts. Don't even. No, you switched the schedule without even asking me. He does it all the time. Zelly, am I the one that locked up and left without telling anyone? No, Stacy, remember that was El? No, how about you tell your dad about how you were supposed to be working... Hey, listen. That's enough. El, you're gonna take all the shifts next week. - Hey, hey! Hey... Hey! - That's not fair! - Hey! And get this place clean. - Sorry. I have more important people coming tomorrow. And until further notice, you're grounded. - I didn't... - End of story. Boys, let's go. El's closing up tonight. I hope this sinks in. Yikes. We'll be right up, Dad.

That doesn't mean that you can just shove your shifts on me. - Oh, "shove"? - Why are you always complaining? We're the ones who had to leave everything behind in Jersey to come out to this dump. This place is not a dump. Are you sure about that, El? It's not a dump? [both chuckling] We just couldn't figure out your system in the back. [Groans] So, it might need some organizing. Oops.

I'm home. - [Mom] We're in here, honey. - Finally. I had the most incredible day. Oh, apparently. So incredible that you completely missed dinner. And all the gala prep. Hmm. Yeah, I know, but I was at Dad's drop and while I was in line, I actually met this really handsome... Whoa, whoa. Honey. You were in line? You could've just called the office to get yourself a pair. - No. - You were researching the Sleeks, right? I asked Kira to test out the prototype for the hybrid. So you wore them out today? So, what's the word, honey? - Um... - I'm telling you, low-tops are really trending right now. The Sleeks are perfect. You get me some solid numbers, and I'll consider it. Dad, Sneakercon is only a couple months away and we need to dominate if we wanna get our numbers up from last year. It's not like the numbers last year were terrible. [Mom] No, but it wasn't great. They were down from the year before, which was a little down from the year before that, so we just need something big. And that's why I'm telling you, the Sleeks are what King6 needs. - Dad? - Darius? I know there's a lot of pressure right now. This designer is a big deal for us. He's a proven hit-maker. I do like that he's launched these big campaigns. I'll say that. [Liv] He's had three of the biggest launches last year. You gotta trust me, Dad. Something on your mind, Kira? Yeah. I just don't think that the Sleeks are gonna put us back on top. [chuckles] Oh? And why not? They just... They don't say anything. I mean, there's no story behind them. They're... They're not bad, but they're just a little basic. Oh, you did not just call me basic. I just... I think that we could do better. Dad, I mean, we're not exactly tapped into the street up here. We need a new voice. It feels like we need to find someone fresh. Okay, I have a pile of research that says differently. It's just my opinion. And shouldn't my opinion count for something? It does. Your mother's right. Problem is, I learned a long time ago, you cannot run a business on your opinions alone. Talent, passion. It's only part of it. You see, my team has experience, and they do all this research and if all that says the Sleek is what we need right now to put us back on top, that's what we doing. - Dad, come on. Just give me a shot. - [Mom] Mm-hmm. [Kira] You gave Liv a chance when she asked. I'm really happy that you wanna be more involved in the family business, but a lot of jobs rely on these decisions. So, you gotta come at me with something other than, "They're basic. I'm right." - You know what I'm saying? - [Mom] You know what? Babe, it can't hurt to keep looking. Darius, we have a little time. [sighs] All right. I don't think you're gonna find this person, but I'll let you try. - Wait, wait. What? - [Darius] So, this is the deal. - Kira… - Mm-hmm? …If you find a designer that we should consider, someone that speaks to you, tells a story and has the experience to back it up, we'll try it out. - Really? - [grunting] Dad, this means so much to me. - You did hear me say "and," right? - Yeah. Yeah, Dad, I did. All right. Good. Now, the gala's in two weeks, and if we haven't found a designer that changes the game for us by then, we'll go with your sister's Sleeks. - Okay. What's next? - Well, we have the gala charity auction. - Oh, that's all your mom. - [exhales] - I got a call coming. - [Mom] No. Yeah, I gotta take this. - Oh. Hey, Dad. - Yeah? Thanks. You got it, kid. Hey, call the Sneakercon team and tell them to wait. We're gonna keep looking. - [El] No. - [Sami] Yep. [El] No way. No. - Mm-hmm. - She's... - No, but... but i-it can't be. It can't be. - Dude, I didn't... Oh, my Go... - Look at your face! What is going on? - I don't know what you're talking about. Sami. No creases. - You touch it, you buy it. - Sorry. God. - Ooh. [Exclaims] - Sorry. We were hanging out with Kira King. Kira King. Darius King's daughter, aka, sneaker royalty. How'd I not know? I've had the King's poster on my wall since I was seven. It's the King. That's crazy. Like, she's like a princess, yeah? [gasps] Oh, no, Sami. - I messed up. - Don't even worry about it. Like, you would know who Kira King is by sight. Come on. - Cute. - Thanks. [whispering] Sami, listen. Okay, I dissed her kicks. Her King6 kicks, all right? I dissed her father. Okay, yeah, but what were you gonna do? Lie to the girl? - You've gotta call it like you see it. - Why are you not freaking out like I am? El, you're missing the big picture here, okay? Now that we know who she really is… And boom! - Eh? - The King's charity gala? Yeah. Now you know how to find her again. You're welcome. Okay, okay. At the most exclusive sneaker event of the year? Great idea. It's not gonna happen. What? Dude, how is this not, like, the definition of fate? - Oh, come on. You like her. She likes you. - Hey, you don't know that, okay? Yeah, okay, I was sweating from the heat between you two yesterday. [laughs] Stop, all right? You said you saw, like... like, heat? Just a little bit. Dude, just take a shot. It's never gonna happen. Not gonna happen. Why? It's not. I-I-It's just not. It can't, all right? It's not scientifically possible, because I am just... If you say "stock boy"… I was gonna say "nobody." Oh, that's nice. I'm a nobody, and look at her. She's a total somebody. Okay, so you wanna show her you're a somebody, show off your talent. - Design some sick kicks for the gala. - Sami, it's in two weeks. - There's not enough time for that. - Best get to work then. It's not gonna happen. Look, you can't show up in your beaters, okay? And I know you wouldn't wanna do that anyway. Look at them. This is your shot to show Miss Kira King who you really are. Come on. - Plea... - [stepfather] El? [both sigh] Not who he says you are. [stepfather] El, I need you out here. Coming. - You're crazy. - Think about it. It's never gonna happen. Hey, never say never. You should really consider the craftsmanship and the material. It's Italian leather. - It's very nice. - Mmm. [sighs] But I think it's a little outside my price range. You're on your feet all day at the restaurant. Don't your feet deserve a treat, hmm? - El! There you are. - Mrs. Singh! Oh. Mmm, how you doing? You know, I've been meaning to drop these off. - Okay, what you got for me? - I wanna make sure you had these just in case your allergies acted up this fall. - Thank you. - Your mom always swore - by my home remedies. - That she did. - So give them a try, beta, okay? - Will do. - Love the window by the way. - Look, I'll show you. Aw. You're so sweet. Aleko let me rescue the clock hands from the trash so… Aren't you clever? Rosie would love it. - You think? - Think about what I said Mrs. Singh. I'd be happy to throw in a free pair of Odor-Eaters. Did he just tell me my feet stink? Quite possibly. Bye, Mrs. Singh. [Mrs. Singh] Bye! I don't get this neighborhood. They all pretend to be one big, happy family. But when it comes down to it, where are they? - I mean, they don't know you. - [stepfather] And that's my fault? Look, I've brought in all kinds of styles and new items so everyone will have something to pick from. I'm really trying. And obviously you don't know them either. Yeah, well, looks like the shop's going back to the sneaker business anyway. What? Hey, maybe I could curate something... I've spoken to Foot Locker about buying this space. What are you... - You're selling the store? - If I can get one of these execs to bite. We're already a month behind in the mortgage and... - The way things are looking, I... - You... No. We can do a GoFundMe. All right? A... A fundraiser... No, no, no, El! You always got your head in the clouds. Not everything works out the way you want it to. You think I don't know that? Huh? Mom wouldn't want you to sell. - And if you ever loved her... - Hey, hey! I did love her! You think this is something I wanted to do alone? [Scoffs] Why do you think I've been so hard on you? Trying to keep this store afloat. Enough is enough. Sometimes you just gotta let your dreams go. - [door opens, closes] - [sighs] [Sami] Hello, I did it. I got it all figured out. Logan's brother's best friend, Jeremy, and his cousin are working in catering at the gala. So as long as we get there before the event starts he'll sneak us into the service entrance. Cool. You think it's too uncool to go as waiters? I was totally thinking that. But it's fine. We can costume change there. - He's selling Laces. - [Sami] What? Trey's selling Laces. He can't... He can't do that, can he? He just did. [sighs] The thing that my mom loves most is gone. - [Sami] Hey. - [exhales] - It's gone. - El, that is not true. You're still here. And as long as you carry on her legacy, she's not fully gone either. Sami, Sami! I... I don't know how to do that. Okay? This... This place is everything to her. - [Sami] It's... - This place is… [sighs] - It's just a place, El. - "Just a place"? - Come on. I didn't mean... - [El] Just... I didn't mean it like that. Listen, I love this place. I think I know about ten ways to lace up my kicks because of this place. Because of your mom. Your super cool, funky mom. I miss her. Me too. A lot. And I think we both know what she'd want you to do. Get up. Come on. You've got sneakers to make. [sighs] See the person, then you'll see the shoe.

And just because Dad's out doesn't mean you're not still grounded. Look, guys, please. I have someone very important to meet. He puts in hair extensions, and he thinks he's all that, huh?

Try them on. Try them on. Let's see how they fit. Oh, yes. Whoa! [Laughs] Whoo! Hey! Ah. Whoo! [Gustavo] Wow, those are some shoes, my friend. - [El singing] Hey! - [Gustavo] Nice. - Let's go!

Yeah, everyone needs a ticket. - Yeah, uh, we... - Tickets. Sami. [gasps] [laughs] [beeps] Yeah, enjoy your evening. - Thank you. - We shall. [house music playing] This is a lot. - Hello, good evening. - Oh, word! They've got spoon appetizers! Sir, I'm... Sami. I'm so sorry. - She really likes that. - That's good. That's really good. Thanks. Mmm. - [gulps] - That is not classy. - I'm good. Thank you. - More for me. I think I'm gonna take a lap. See if I can find Kira. Hey, don't forget. You're a rock star. Let me get your picture. - Okay. - Don't eat everything. Get lost. Mmm. E-E-Excuse me? Mm-hmm? What? Who is that? - We need those sneakers. - We've never seen anything like them. That's 'cause they're one of ones. - Really? - [Sami] Mm-hmm. I mean, you can try to convince him to make you a pair, but I've been waiting for years. - He's the designer? - Yep. [attendee] Well, who's he with? Um, he's with me. No. She means who's he with? The company. Um… I'm not at liberty to say. [groans] Did you sign an NDA? Mmm. I can't even tell you that. - [sighs] Come on. She's messing with us. - You sure about that? - I am going to find out who he's with. - Yeah? - Good luck. I'm gonna beat you to it. - All right. - Have you seen... - [attendee 1 murmurs] [attendee 2] My team is all over this. [attendee 3] Oh, my God. Okay, so it's not King. Is it King or is it not King? I need to know. Those shoes are out of this world. Apparently three brands are chasing him, and he hasn't committed yet. [attendee 4] I'm telling you. He's got some top-secret collab brewing. [attendee 5] Oh, my God. Did you see what I saw? I mean, it's amazing. [attendee 6] You know it's gonna be all over the next issue of Complex. [attendee 7] Does anybody know his name? - [attendee 8] Do you know anything… - [indistinct whispering] [attendee 9] Have you seen this designer that everyone's talking about? [attendee 10] Yeah, he does. [attendee 11] These are incredible. [attendee 12] He has designed for everyone. [whispering continues] - [whispering stops] - Oh, sorry. Oh, my gosh.

This time I want to show you something. Come on. - Sorry. - [El] Pardon me. [security] It's all yours, Miss King. - [Kira] Thank you. - You're welcome. [El] Where you taking me? Whoa. Voilà. Whoa. Whoa! Yo! Oh, my God. This is sneaker heaven. Oh! [cheering] - El! - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You got the tie-dyes. - Got the tie-dyes. - Oh, my... Jordans? Did Jordan sign this? - Oh, God! This is amazing. - Oh, my God. [El] This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Thank you. Ooh, I got chills. This is my dream. My mom would love this. So, which ones are your favorite to wear? Are you kidding? I'm not allowed to touch them, I mean, never mind wear them. What? Not even once? Whoa. No... No way. [laughing] Yo. Yo. You haven't touched these? Your dad's OG Blues from the finals when he hit that buzzer-beater against the Celtics? I don't believe it. Okay, one time when I was a little kid and I wore them out to the elevator, but then I chickened out and put them back. You know, um, I think these might not be your size. You know, you didn't really inherit the height of your father. They were a little bit too big, huh? Aight. Enough about my family. Tell me. What kicks you rocking tonight? Um… You know, it's just a little… Oh, my God. Did you design these? Wow. That colorway. Wait, is that the graffiti wall? Yeah. Look at the soles. El, I can see our whole day in them. Wait a second. - You're him! You're the guy. - The guy? Yeah, yeah, the guy. - The guy with the secret celebrity collab. - What? The guy that everybody's been talking about tonight. My sister, Liv, was going on and on about it. Why didn't you tell me the other day that you were a designer? - And a phenomenal one at that. - Manhattan. You didn't tell me you were Kira King. Huh? Kira King. Like, that's something that's kind of important to know. Sneaker royalty? - Royalty? - [El] Yeah. Okay. That's fair. I'm Kira King. I know. - Nice to meet you. - Hi. And listen, you have to come with me. This is destiny. 'Cause tonight's literally my last chance to prove to my dad that there's a designer out there who's actually saying something, who's got a point of view. And, El… You're him. W-Wait. You're saying I should design for the King brand? Yeah. - [applause] - King brand? - Like... - Oh. Oh, that's him. - Who? - Come on. My dad. - [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen… - Come on. Now's our chance. - …basketball legend… - [El] Right now? …and your host for this evening's King6 Annual Charity Gala, Darius King. [Darius] My wife, Denise, and I would like to thank you all for coming. As a kid growing up in the streets of Queens, I didn't always have the money - to buy the freshest pair… - Okay. Oh, God. I'm so excited. Once he's done with his intro, I'll grab him. [Darius] Who believed in my dream? Yo, this is crazy. I mean, he's gonna lose it when he sees your work. Y-Y-You think so? [Darius] …to the next level. And King6 was born. Under the direction of my eldest daughter, Liv, we will be dropping something unlike anything you've seen before. [applause] Working with great talent, people we believe in. As I talk about Liv… - Anyway, uh, he will. - [Darius] …I'm reminded… Listen, you know, it's kind of silly, but my dad, he says that experience really matters, so he's gonna want to know everything about you. Like where you're from or what else you've done - or who you've worked with. - Oh. - Okay. - Yeah. You're young, but the way you've blown up, you've obviously had, like… - Well... I... - …tons of professional gigs, right? I got a lot riding on this. I'm your guy. I'm never going to forget tonight. - S-Same. - [clears throat] Where have you been? Oh, good. You found her. - Hey, Sami. - Hi. - [Liv] You know these people? - This is the guy. You're the guy? Uh, I did design these, but I'm not really... Of course, he's the guy. I mean, look at the shoes. Can I take a picture of you? You look so beautiful. Now, you get in there. - Oh, stop being so modest. - [Kira] Yeah. He's such a superstar. [Squeals] Look at that power couple. [squeals] That's so cute. I'm gonna frame it. [all laugh] I'm so excited. I really want Dad to meet him. Isn't this exactly who he told me to find? [Liv] Take a deep breath. You'll get a chance to introduce him to Dad when he's done. [Darius] This program promotes honesty and integrity, which are very important… I wish he'd hurry up. It is almost midnight, so you know he always does the auction then. - Midnight? - Oh, yeah. Midnight. [bell tolls] [gasps] Oh, no, we can't go. You're about to meet King. That's exactly the problem. I... I screwed up. Okay, okay. G did warn us about midnight. I'm... I'm sorry. What is going on... [announcer] Give it up for Darius King. He'll be stepping down so we can start the auction at midnight. [El] I'm so sorry. I really gotta get the guy out of here right now. It's... It's a... Uh... - Wait. What? - A curfew thing. - Follow me. - [El] Excuse me. - What is up with your friends? - I don't know. - Excuse me. - [Liv] You can't leave yet. - [Sami] Gotta go. Sorry. - I'll be right back. - [El] Come on. - [Kira] El! - Sorry. - [El] Hey, hey! [tolling continues] [El] No. [shouts] My suit! [grunts, screams] What is happening? [Sami] El, I'm covered in appetizers. Run! Excuse me. - Oh, shoot. I don't know. - Wait, what are you doing? That's the up. [screams, grunts] I'm stuck! [shouts] [Sami] Jump! [grunts] [Kira] El! [gasps] My shoe! My shoe! No! [tolling continues] Don't let him leave. [gasps] [Sami] Leave it. El. - I'm sorry. - We gotta go. [Kira] How do I find you again? [bell tolling, clock ticking] - Go, go, go! - Watch out, people! [Sami screams] - [gasps] - [El] Wait! - No! - Wait, wait, wait. [Sami] We're here! - No, wait. - We're here. We're... [gasps] [bells toll] [both gasp] Ooh. [panting] - [El] Hey, Sami. - [Sami] Yeah? [El] Why did everyone at that party think I was this hot underground designer? One that's blowing up worldwide. - What did you say? - Nothing. - What did you tell them? - Nothing m-much. - Just that you're a designer… - Mm-hmm. …and you're really cool. And that's... That's about it. Samantha. - Okay, I may have hyped you up a little… - Why? …but I barely said anything. I can't help what conclusions other people might have jumped to. Okay, well, Kira asked me if I have professional experience. - And? - And... She wanted me to meet Mr. King. So I said... I said I did. - Dude, that's amazing! - No, that's not good. That's horrible. I lied. I lied to her. Okay, do you think anyone at that party was a 100% real? - Yes. - No. Look, we both exaggerated a teeny amount, and it's gonna turn out great. - [sighs] - Probably. [El] Sami, how can I face her again after this? So tell me again why he ran away. - He's an artist. They're all… You know. - [Darius] Mmm. I mean, Banksy doesn't ever show his face. And you're a really big deal, Dad. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - I mean, people get nervous. - Yeah, nice try. - Okay, but Dad. Come on, look. Look at the work. I mean, it speaks for itself, right? I admit it does draw me in. It's like looking at something entirely new, but so familiar. It reminds me of home. I don't know why. It's very colorful. Yo, I know that spot. Your mom took me here when we first started dating. - Really? - Yeah, they had, like, the best dessert. - It was like this custardy thing... - Galaktoboureko? Yeah. Hey, how you know that? He took me there. I still don't like that I don't know anything about his background. [sighs] He's worked with plenty top-tier brands. Look how personal his work is. I trust him. I just really need you to trust me. [sighs] Liv? I admit it's good work, but the unknown factor just makes it very risky. Okay, Kira. You bring him in. We'll sit him down, and if everything you say checks out, then we'll try to showcase it at Sneakercon. - Really? - Yes. - Thanks, Dad. - You got it. - Love you, Dad! - Peace! [Kira] Yes! Yes, yes, yes. [Laughs] [singing] [fan 1] Yo, King, can I take a selfie? - [fan 2] Darius! - [fan 3] Over here. - What happened last night? - [fan 4] I just met the King. [fan 5] Yo, King I wanna score too. I just want you to understand how much is on the line for us right now. Which is why… I'm gonna help you with anything you need. Okay? You will? If this is what we're doing, then let's really do it. Let's make it happen. I'm all in, okay? - Thank you. - Of course. All right, now we just gotta find him. Yes! Call him. Text him right now. Yeah, I can't. I don't have his number or Instagram or... - So you've hung out twice… - I know. - …and you didn't get any digits? - Yeah. Girl, what's going on? Your game needs work. - I need help. - Yes, you do. I only have his first name. And I don't know how to find him, but I do have his shoe. You talk about connecting with people when we were at dinner, right? - Yeah. - Well, we've got 40 million followers. Let's connect with them. Why don't we do a whole King6 campaign to find the designer who has the match to the shoe? - Let's do it. All right. - Yes. Let's do it. Let's plan. Okay. But let's make him come to us. - [Kira] Maybe we could do a photo shoot? - Yes. We'll blast out a picture of you holding the shoe. - We'll need a catchy tag line too. - Yeah. Right?

And from how hard she's trying to find you, I think that's not all she's into. Sami, this... This is so important to Kira. Okay, and... I... I don't wanna hurt her. Oh, right, because publicly ghosting someone is a great way not to hurt their feelings, right? Sami, you weren't there. Okay, if you could have seen the look of relief on her face when she thought I was this big shot designer. - She... She doesn't want this El. - Hey! - She doesn't. She doesn't. - Nah-uh-uh. You sit down. You don't talk about my best friend like that. Disrespectful. Listen, why do you think Kira didn't tell you she was Kira King on that first day? It's because she doesn't care about that stuff, dude. And all those things people said about you at the gala, I didn't correct them, because to me they are true. They will be true. But in order for the world to believe that, you've gotta believe it first. Do you? Are you sure this will work? Um, if I'm your hype woman, let me hype. - You like? - Yeah. I do.

Well, you know what's professional? Being on time. - [chuckles] Funny. - Mm-hmm. Dude. This is so beautiful. Is this what you're gonna show King today? The Sneakercon design? Yeah. [Sighs] Inspired by Kira. Where's the sneaker? - What? - Sami, where's the sneaker? Where's my sneaker? - Come on. We gotta go. - I need the shoe. - No, you don't. - I can't go without the shoe. - Yes, you can. You've seen this, right? - Sami. - Yeah. - Listen to me. Kira knows you. She already knows you made that shoe. Now it's about your new designs. I'm telling you. You bring this, and you'll win everybody over. That is if we actually get on the subway. - So let's go. - It's pretty good. It's not "pretty good." It's amazing. Come on. [hip hop music playing] I'm enough.

[Stacy] Good luck in your meeting. Don't we want the meeting to go bad? - [Stacy] What? - Sucker. [boys cackling] Shoot! [Liv sighs] Hey. Hey, Kira. You wanted a meeting with my dad, right? Go ahead. Your brothers had a lot to say about you, El. Mr. King, those are my stepbrothers, and y-you can't trust anything they say. Trust? You wanna talk about trust? Look, I can explain. Kira, please. Sit down. Did you or did you not tell my daughter you were a designer? A big-shot, underground designer with fans all over the world? Yes. I-I designed those. Um, I am a designer. But you lied. Yeah. So you're a hustler. You're a scam artist. This whole stunt was about you creating a name for yourself. Use our brand, use our followers to make some cash. - No, it's not like that. I'm not... - It's not? So is your father not in the middle of trying to off-load his failing shoe store that's drowning in debt? Trey's my stepfather. Okay, it's my mom's shop. Did you even design these, or was this part of the hustle? No, no. Um, yes. Yes. That shoe right there, that's all me. That's... That's everything. And we're supposed to believe you? Sneakercon is in a couple of weeks! You've put us in a bind. And my daughter vouched for you. She put herself on the line for the first time publicly, all for lies. I think we're done here. Don't ever come around my daughter again. Kira. Kira, please. Look. Look, I'm so sorry. - How could you lie to me? - I didn't mean to lie. You knew what this meant to me. You wanted me to be all those things that everyone said I was. I... So this is my fault? - No, of course not. - Unbelievable. I'm... No, I'm just saying my designs, they weren't enough for you. I thought if I told you I was a stock boy, you... you wouldn't look at me the same. [sniffles] Hey, don't cry. Come on. I... I'm that same dude from that first day. - Oh, no. No. - I am. Kira, come on. Now you're just someone I never want to see again. Goodbye, El. - I'm sorry. - Security. Kira, I'm sorry. - Kira, please. Come on. Hey. - That's enough. You need to leave. Kira! Kira! - I'm escorting you out. - I'm good. I'm good. - Hey, how'd it go? We in business? - It's over. [glass clinking] Mrs. Singh. Come on. You know I do this every Wednesday night. I'm going to have to get used to doing it myself. - [stammering] - Honey, it's okay. It'll be my cardio. I really can't believe you're leaving. It all happened so quickly. Come here. Stay in touch. I'm really gonna miss you. [sighs] [Gustavo] What would become of his dreams? Would he never see his passion and talent fulfilled because of one mistake? Or would the neighborhood he loved and whose spirit he represented come together to give him one more chance? Well, that would be its own kind of magic, wouldn't it? [Denise] Kira. Kira. - Hey, today's the big day. - [Kira] Yeah. - [Denise] It's game day. - For Liv. [scoffs] No, for all of us. You're a big part of this company too, Kira, and this family. - We're all Kings. - I don't feel like one. [Denise] Well, you gotta straighten your crown. You know, I've been really proud of you these past few weeks. Why? Mom, I screwed up big time. - It was all a lie. - All? Everything El said about his experience. He got in over his head. Then again, so did you. How is it my fault that he lied? I don't understand. Oh, I suppose it's impossible that you wanted this so badly, you might have led him into saying what you needed to hear? - Maybe. - [Denise] Maybe. Come here. Listen to me. It is not easy as a young woman to stand up and have your voice heard above everybody else's, and especially your father's. - Yeah. - Okay? - [Kira] Yeah. - Got a big mouth. Yeah. But you did. And I'm very proud of you for that because that means that you're starting to find your own voice and trust yourself. - That means you're growing up. - Yeah. And you know what? Okay, so you messed up. We all do. The most important thing is that you figure out what it is that you can do differently next time. - Yeah, I guess you're right, Mom. - Oh, of course I am. Baby, you know how many of these talks I've given over the years to Liv? - Wait, really? - Uh-huh. And to your dad. - Mm-hmm, absolutely. - What? Baby, he did not become the King on his own, my love, okay? - My baby. - What's so funny? - Oh, baby. Aw. - What? - You look great. - Stop. Okay. Get up. We gotta go. - I love you. - All right. Get up. All right. - Let me get that hair, baby. - [Liv] Were y'all talking about me? - No. - No, no, no. Breakfast now.

[Liv] Yes! We've got a lot in store for you today. First, we are so excited to be giving you an exclusive sneak peek at the newest King6 kick, the Sleek, which I personally developed. And how cool to be broadcasting directly to our fans at Sneakercon Cleveland today. We have a special treat lined up that you won't wanna miss, so be sure to watch live at 10:00 a.m. And thank you to all of our amazing supporters who turned up this morning. We love you. - Sorry. Didn't see you there. My bad. - Dude, really? [crowd cheering on speaker] What? - Zelly. Zelly! - Huh? Yo, what's up? Can you smell the fresh Jersey air yet? - El is gone. - [Zelly] What? [Stacy] He's gone to some Sneakercon thing at King6. What if he can get enough money to keep the store? - Should we go there? I'll drive. - Yeah. - [laughs] No. - [Zelly] It's okay. [Stacy] Come on. [Zelly] Don't worry. All right. Let's go. Dad! El took off, but we know where he is. - Bye, Dad. - [Stacy] We'll be back in an hour. - What are you talking about? - Dad, move. - We got a schedule. Where is El? - [horn honking] - What? Whoa, whoa. - I'll see you real soon, Dad. Stop joking around. Get out of the truck. - [Zelly] We're not joking around. - [Stacy] Dad, it's all good. Just relax. - Get... Wait! - Bye! Where are you going? Get back here! Get back here! You murdered my cone! [sighs] I cannot afford this. Sami, okay. What is going on? Can you just tell me where El is? I can't deal with him trying to sabotage anything to do with this deal. [scoffs] I know he doesn't want to leave. He... H-He just doesn't get it. No. You're the one that doesn't get it. Your stepson is talented, and he's kind and he's hopeful, despite all your best efforts. You know what? I think it's time for you to see El for who he truly is. - [crowd cheering] - Who's ready for some OG King? We convinced the King to dust off his famous '90s jam - from his heyday on the court. - What?

And so should I. - [El] What? - What? What are you talking about? I'm really sorry that I pushed you to say all that stuff. My dad, he said that experience mattered. And I don't... I don't know. I just... I got so wrapped up in that that I forgot what really matters, what I want my family to stand for, what I believe in. Your talent. Your passion. El, you're amazing. And I believe in you. And that should be enough. Look at his work, Liv. It's kind of spectacular, no? I'm not the one you have to convince. You clearly put your voice into your work. Can you bring it to the stage? Hmm?
