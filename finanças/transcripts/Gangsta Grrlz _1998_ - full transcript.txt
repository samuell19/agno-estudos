A black woman in the 90s. Young, smart. Thugs always trying to get next to you. They wanna ask me out. (soft tense music) I need protection everywhere I go. There's always someone with me, watching me, guarding me. I grew up in southwest Philly. When I was 17, my boyfriend took me to my first drug buy. He gave me the gun, said they wouldn't frisk me. So, we sitting down, he checking out the shit. All of a sudden, this fool come rushing out the hall, trying to jam us up. (gunshot) That turned out to be my first homicide. I remember how I felt then, hysterical, crying and screaming as he dragged me out the spot. I miss that feeling. I wish I could go back. Back to when I was soft and innocent. We came up after that. But eventually the cops caught him. He left his fingerprints on the table. I served one year for the drugs they found when they served the warrant. He pleaded guilty to homicide for me. Said he felt responsible. I really think he loved me. He served nine months of a eight sentence in Rockview. He was killed there a short time after. When I got out, I went to the house we used to live in to get our stash. It was right where we left it. It wasn't much, but it was enough to get me on my feet, though. For one year in prison, I barely talked but I listened to everything that was said. Every story that was told. By the time I got out, I was ready for the street. I knew what I wanted to do and I knew how to do it. I did whatever it took to build a nice lay. I even killed for it. (gunshot) Now, don't get it twisted, I'm far from rich and I used to know how to make myself happy. If I learned one thing in this business, it's once you get on top. (phone ringing) The fight to stay up there is just as difficult as what you did to get there in the first place. - Yo.

Several neighbors reported hearing the shots but could not shed any light on who have committed this gruesome crime. So what? - That was Penn, asshole. - Shit. I aint know that motherfucker real name. - Get the fuck outta here. - Nigga, what the fuck is you doing? Just take the fucking paper. - Nigga, I wanna see, too. Fuck you, motherfucker. - Damn.

He was gonna testify against her in court. So she had him killed. Stupid motherfucker! I told him to lay low. Dummy. Well, you know what this means, don't you? We definitely gonna have to do something about this shit. So this is what I want you two to do. I want you to follow her, keep tabs on her.

I take care of all the girls here. It's my job to make sure you doing your job. You do what you're told, we won't have any problems. Now, all we sell is weight. If I catch you on the cornering pimping dime bags, there's your ass. - All right. Can I ask you a question? - [T] What? - Is Ninea gay? - Why? You got a problem with gay people? - I was just wondering because I haven't seen no men up in here. Only thing I see was women. - [T] No, Ninea is not gay. She doesn't trust men, though. - Are you gay? - Why, you interested? - Uh. - [T] Well, anyway. I have a favor to ask you. I want you to snort a line of some blow right here. - Nah, that's all right.

(woman coughing) - Oh god. (bell tolling) - We don't know why he did it. All we wanted to do was come in and question him, you know? The guy said he had to pee. He went to the bathroom and he blew his fucking brains out. - [Woman] What? You mean to tell me he blew his brains out while you two was still in the house? - Yeah. - Wow. Do you know if he ever killed that girl or not? - We never got a chance to ask him. Apparently someone tipped us off and led us to him. Obviously, he was doing something that we didn't know about. We tore the house apart and we found nothing. - Guy did something and he panicked and he blew his head off. - Wow. This is so fucking bizarre. I don't think I can live in your world.
