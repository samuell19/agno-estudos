[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] [WATER RUNNING] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] BOTH: ♪ Ring around the rosy ♪ A pocketful of posies ♪ Ashes, ashes... [BOTH SCREAMING] [LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] She's special, ain't she, Billy? BILLY: I think she has to be to marry you. Thanks for being here, Billy. Oh! Listen... I wouldn't miss this for the world. It was worth it just to see your knees rattle. [LAUGHING] Oh... [SIGHS] Nancy, I am so glad you came. Stop, I wouldn't have missed it for the world. Oh... That looks interesting. Yeah, I like that. Table looks wonderful, let's try it. [MUSIC STOPS] [BAND PLAYING SOLEMN TUNE] Sure is one pretty lady. Hmm, yeah. Go on, don't be shy. Ask her to dance. Go on, go on, go on.All right. Hold this till I get back and try not to drink it all. [CHUCKLING] Montoya, could I dance with my wife? Well, where have you been? Out hustling women. Oh, why did I even marry you? Don't know, maybe it's my incredible charm and intellect. Oh, maybe. Your friend thinks it's because I felt sorry for you. That sounds like him.[LAUGHING] I really like him, Isaac, he's so funny. And I think he loves you very much. Yeah, well, that's too bad 'cause I'm already married. Mmm...Listen, Maria, do me a favor, will you? Hmm.Don't let Billy hear you calling me Isaac. Why? It's your name.Yeah, I know that. It's just that, well, I always went by Ike when I was in the service. And Isaac... Well, he just doesn't... [SIGHS] He'd never let me forget it. Okay? Okay. Ike. And don't go trying to analyze it too much either, I know it's your job. I won't. Ike. Hmm. [LAUGHING] [SPEAKING INCOHERENTLY] One more. [SPEAKING INCOHERENTLY] A toast. Tequila. Tequila.Tequila. Whoa! Boy! [LAUGHING] [MUMBLING] I am resting. I am resting. Good night, Mom. Good night, Mom. Good night, sleepy. Oh, I don't think I have ever seen any man drink that much tequila. How's he going to be able to fly tomorrow? Don't worry about him. You just make sure that you're here right after work with that car... Hmm....like you promised. 'Cause as soon as old Billy's on that plane, you and me are going... BOTH: Honeymooning.[BOTH LAUGHING] IKE: Ah![BOTH LAUGHING] Oh!Ow! Oh, I don't know if I should let you do this until the honeymoon. Because you know, I, um... I really wanted the first time to be really special. It was special. And the time after that, and the time after that...[GIGGLING] ...and the time after that, they were all special. Wait. You think it was wrong that I wore white? Oh... INMATE: Yo, Kutner, give 'em hell. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] [HORN HONKING] Pass me, you dumb shit! Sorry, I'm late. Mr. Kutner, I believe you know Mr. Allen and Miss Montoya. Or rather I should say Mrs. Slayton. Congratulations, Maria, we do apologize for delaying your honeymoon, but this shouldn't take too long. Now, Mr. Kutner, this is what, your third time before the board. I'm sure you're familiar with the procedure by now. Is there anything you would like to say on your behalf? Would it make any difference? This is a bunch of horseshit anyway. You people don't intend to let me out. So why are you wasting my time? EXAMINER: Now, wait a minute, Mr. Kutner. We haven't decided on anything yet. Our decision on granting your parole is entirely up to you. We just want to know, have the last seven years made any difference at all to you? What do you think? Well, we're asking you, Mr. Kutner. You wanna know, if, um, I'm sorry for what I did? Do you wanna know if I've been rehabilitated? Mr. Allen? Twenty years ago, when I prosecuted this man, he never displayed a shred of remorse for strangling the life out of an eight-year-old girl. Eight years old. And we know there were plenty more of them, that were never found. Don't we, John? You've heard Mr. Kutner. Gentlemen, I think his attitude speaks for itself. He hasn't changed. And he doesn't care. The board should absolutely deny parole to this man. He's still a very sick individual. I love you, too, sweet lips. [BREAKS PENCIL]That's enough. Mrs. Slayton? [CLEARS THROAT] As you can see, continued periodic evaluations have shown Mr. Kutner to be sociopathic and quite resistant to rehabilitation. He's very angry, very hostile and very violent. I would definitely consider him a threat to society. And, like Mr. Allen, would strongly recommend denial of parole. [CLEARS THROAT] [HORN HONKING] [HORN HONKING] [HORN HONKING] [TIRES SCREECHING] CAPTAIN: Warden, we've got a truck full of bromine split open down here. Toxic gas cloud is headed your way. One whiff of that stuff, and you'll be dead before you know it. It's deadly poison. But I hope to hell you're sure of one thing. Are you absolutely certain that thing is moving this way? That's affirmative, Warden. Wind's taking it dead east. I'd say it'll reach the prison in less than 15 minutes. No, no, sir. They say there's no way to shut it down. All we can do is let it empty and wait for it to dissipate. All right. All right, Captain, look, I'll check in with you when we're ready to roll. Thank you. [SIGHS] Well, that confirms it. It's bromine gas and it's toxic. I don't think it's that serious. We can't take any chances. We'll bus the population north on the highway and wait until it passes. But, Warden, do you realize how many men we're talking about evacuating here? Get the goddamn buses in the yard, Tom, and let's get this show on the road. [ALARMS WAILING] This is the Warden. We're conducting an emergency evacuation of the prison. Repeat, an emergency evacuation. All prisoners are to be taken to the yard. Prison personnel are advised to follow emergency evacuation procedures, and take extra precautions. This is an emergency evacuation. All prisoners are to be removed from cells and taken to the yard as quickly as possible. Follow evacuation procedure. Repeat, this is an emergency evacuation. I'm getting my ass paroled anyway. Whoa now! [GRUNTING]You just better behave yourself. Remember, Doc, I'm angry, violent and hostile. [ALARMS WAILING][INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] If you say a word, I'll break your neck. Yo, take us with you. You're on your own. You can't just walk out of here, you know. I wasn't planning on walking. Patch! Patch! I'm splitting this place, you coming? Oh. Are you kidding? I am with you, man. Warden, we have a problem. Uh, I'll talk to you later. Now walk to that bus like you fucking own this place. There! Chase, look after her. Drive. Close that gate! Stop the bus! No firing, damn it! Hold your fire, hold your fire. Hold your fire. [TIRES SCREECHING] God damn it, what the hell are you doing, John? Trying to get us all killed? Yeah, John, that's what I wanna know. What the hell do you think you're doing? [SIRENS WAILING] Shit, they're coming, man. The bastards are right behind us. Get away. If you're gonna block it, Lieutenant, I suggest you do it quick. I know where he's headed. Right straight for the Mexican border. Where the hell's he taking us? It's like 40 miles to the border! I'm going home, compadres. Yoo-hoo!I didn't sign up for any fucking Mexican joyride. Hang on! [BRAKES SCREECHING] Whoo! That was just fucking great! What's the matter, you got a problem, Kincaid? Fuck me, I got a problem. Some of us aren't hard timers like you and Kutner. I've only got a few years left, and I don't need more time now. Shut the fuck up! What the hell? Don't hate, man. [BRAKES SCREECHING] [OPENS BUS DOOR] All right. Anyone wants out, this is your chance. Stay or go. You better decide pretty damn quick. I'm with you, Kutner. Me, too. Kincaid? Anyone else? [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] [TIRES SCREECHING] What the hell is that?Staties roadblock. Oh, great, Kutner. Now what? Can't outrun them in this thing, that's for goddamn sure. Hey, John, I used to work a mine, an old copper town called Sonora. About a quarter mile back there's a road leading straight in. How far to the town?About a mile, mile and a half. It's near empty, now the mine is dead, couldn't be more than about 50 people. We could use more hostages.Uh-huh, and weapons. All right, in the cars, let's go. [TIRES SCREECHING] [SIRENS WAILING] CAPTAIN: Looks like they're headed for Sonora. I'll try to radio the sheriff. We are in pursuit. OFFICER: Be advised there's a hostage on that bus. Just try and contain until we can get some backup. [TIRES SCREECHING] Let's go. Let's go, guys. KUTNER: Come on, come on, come on. All right, round them up. East of town, repeat, there is a bus load of escaped prisoners coming your way. Do you copy? [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Sonora sheriff, do you copy? Over. [GASPS] Good morning, chief. This here is your wake-up call. [SIRENS WAILING] All right, listen up, I want two-men teams. One rifle on each team. I want you to go door-to-door, bring back hostages, weapons, guns, knives... What about those cops? Oh, don't worry about the cops. Believe me, they won't move on us, we got plenty of protection right in here. What about some fucking food? You and your fucking hunger, get out of here. There's some trouble again. [MOANING] [IKE CHUCKLING] Something wrong, sweet pea? Should have stopped me, man. You should have just taken it away. [CHUCKLING] A true friend would not let that happen to a brother in the house. Oh, my God. Never again, Lord, never again. Well, Lord ain't stupid, Billy. Drink this. What is it? Black coffee and a little hair of the pooch. [GROANS] Oh, boy! You hear those sirens?What sirens? Hey, you are the sheriff in this town, ain't you? You know what a siren sounds like?Uh-huh. Talking about that damn siren. Oh... It woke me up. The freaking head buster. Where the hell were you? Maybe I was in the shower. You sure it was a siren? Yeah, it was a siren. Didn't you hear it? [KNOCKING]There is Maria. You're gonna be ready for the airport in one hour? An hour? Aw, man, you got to be shitting me. [MUMBLING] An hour... Try not to throw up. NEWSCASTER: Here's the news bulletin. A bus load of prisoners escaped from the State Penitentiary just an hour ago. [GROANING] These men are armed and dangerous. Last seen headed for the town of Sonora. Don't even blink, pal. Check the place out. Hurry up, Albert. Albert? Albert! Okay, pal, start walking. Move! I said, keep moving, you prick. What the hell are you doing, jackass? Get off that plate, man. Easy, easy. Why don't you just stay for coffee, huh? [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS OVER RADIO] [WHISTLES] Looks like we got a Mexican standoff. Damn!What? They got Maria's father. [EXHALES] Oh, God. So, LT, how are we gonna play this one? Papa.[MAN OVER RADIO SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [BOTH SPEAKING SPANISH] MAN OVER RADIO: Be advised that a National Guard Unit has been mobilized. We've got three choppers on the way. Hey, John. John, you're not going to believe this, man. I'm listening to the radio, they're calling in the Guard. The bloody National Guard. Relax.You hear what I said? They're coming this way, man. We can't just wait for them to get here. Chill out. Those bastards can't do a thing and they know it. Yeah, well, tell it to those Staties. I wish they'd back off. They're making everybody nervous. Bring me Deputy Fife. And that lady shrink. Oh, Christ. Hey! Asshole! I'm sick of seeing your face. Now you got 30 seconds to get your ass out of town before I kill these two.[GUN COCKS] Hey. Easy, partner. He's not that dumb. Twenty! Let the hostages go and drop your weapons, all of you. Drop your weapons. Fifteen. Let those hostages go right now, man. Ten. Nine. Let them go, man! Five. Four. Three. Two. One. [GUNSHOT] Jesus Christ. Son of a bitch. She's next, law man. Nineteen. Eighteen.I can't get a clear shot. Sixteen. Fifteen. All right. Ten. [WOMAN OVER RADIO SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Get back to the cars. Ride up at the hill. Easy. They're backing off.Hey! He's not stopping. Six. Five. Four. Three. [ENGINES STARTING] Two. One. [CHEERING] She's all right. Now you just take it easy. There's nothing you can do about it right now. It was your lucky day, missy. Lucky, lucky day. Hey, man, Kutner's not gonna like this. Big deal, Kutner. What do I look like? A missing persons' bureau? You sure it's the right place? Yeah, I saw them go in. They're probably in there dickin' each other. [COCKS GUN] Smitty? Albert? Hey, turkeys! Hey, man, check this out. Look at this. [LAUGHS] Mmm.Mmm. You big, dumb motherfuckers. [MUFFLED] Get the fuck out of here. Fuck off! Untie them, shit brains. [BOTH GRUNTING] How did you boys end up like that? Unbelievable. Will you fucking hurry up? Motherfucker. Hey, big John. Oh. Guess what I got? No idea.Something you might find pretty interesting. Where'd you find this? Oh, man, right up above where I found Albert and Smitty all trussed up on the floor like a couple of pigs. It's law man here. That's one of the bastards that did it. I think you know the broad. [HELICOPTERS APPROACHING] Cookie jar commandos. Christ, that's all we needed. This is Big One. We got them sitting pretty, boys. Like hens in a coop. Bring these birds on around and set them down in the CP, you copy? Roger, Big One. Bringing them down. Hey, what's going down, man? National Guard. [SCOFFS] They're sending in the cavalry. [GUNS COCKING] Did you look at this? Douglas MacArthur. All right, let's go around. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] I'm Lieutenant Colonel Johnson. Battalion headquarters, Army National Guard. I've been authorized by the governor to take over this operation. I want a briefing on all the intelligence you've got. Let's get cracking on this. Mop it up and get going home. Well, I think you'll want to take a look at this, Colonel. This, here, is the town. One road in. Rest here is all desert. The convicts have 20 to 25 men. At least 10 of them are armed. Probably more. How many captives? It's hard to tell. We think they've got the hostages here in the police station. They've already killed one man, Sheriff's Deputy. It seems clear enough to me. I say we just walk right in and kick them in the balls. Get this thing over with. Sergeant Conlan. Sir. Pay attention, son, you pay attention good. I want two squads. Take them up the road and have them deploy here and here. This is your objective, the police station. Yes, sir.You saw it in recon. Yes, sir.Good, all right. The captives are inside. I want that station surrounded but I don't want anybody firing. Unless it's under my orders. Yes, sir. Get a move on. Sir. Now. Excuse me, Colonel, what about those hostages? What about them? Well, they are in the station, in with the convicts. There's a damn good chance they'll get hit if somebody decides to start shooting. Yeah, it's my firm belief, Captain, there's only one option in these situations, you hit them hard and you get them fast. There's only one dialogue that these sons of bitches understand. Only this is not a football game. We're talking about human lives. Am I or am I not in charge here, mister? You're in charge. As long as we understand that we're gonna do things my way. My way does not include negotiating with the enemy. I ain't no goddamn Henry Kissinger. Holy shit. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Holy mogo. They're invading! Shit! They're coming, Kut. It's the invasion. Calm down. Who's coming? Soldiers. Soldiers are coming up the road. Thousands of them. [WHISTLING] I want some of you guys on the roof. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Ike, something's shaking. Looks like they're setting up some kind of half-ass ambush. You don't think those yahoos will be dumb enough to walk in? I don't believe it. They're gonna get slaughtered. And they aren't the only ones. Hey! Where the hell are you going? Come back here! Don't shoot. Hold your fire. Son of a bitch. [GUN COCKS] Get back! Maybe he's booby trapped, Sarge. Stay where you are. Don't come any closer. Identify yourself, mister. I'm Sheriff Slayton. You're walking your men right into an ambush, they're all around us. What do you think? You think he's telling us the truth? I don't know. Let me have that. Big One. This is Two Bravo. Over. Go, Two Bravo. Sir, we've got someone up ahead in civilian dress who claims he's the Sheriff. He says we're walking into an ambush. Over. Could be that new guy from El Paso, Slater... Slayton. He moved in here about a month ago. What's he doing walking around in civilian dress? Nah. I smell a rat. Big One. Should we hold position, sir? Over. That's a negative, Two Bravo. Negative. You take your men and complete your mission. Listen up, mister. I want you down on your knees, hands behind your head. Didn't you hear what I just said? Just do it. What if he's telling us the truth? We got orders. Let's keep moving, people. Stay alert. Get back, you're gonna get...[GUNSHOTS] [GUNFIRE] I'm gonna die. Two Bravo, what's happening over there? Two Bravo, Big One.Just hang in there, we're gonna get you some help. We're gonna get you some help, hang in there. Two Bravo... What is your status? Repeat, Two Bravo. You got a man down. Whoever the hell is in charge of this operation better get an evac in here, fast. Who is this? Identify yourself. Listen, you jackass, if you don't get your men out of here right away, you're gonna lose your whole damn platoon. Move back! Move back! All cover! To hell with this. Billy, go! Go, go, go, go. [CHEERING] Where's your CO? Brilliant plan, Colonel, slaughter your own men. Hand over more weapons to the convicts. Maybe kill a few hostages along the way. What's your next master plan, nuke the town? You're the one on the squad radio. Who the hell do you think you are, mister? I'm a guy with a wife back in that town, you dumb son of a bitch. Save your breath, LT, he can't hear you. Assholes don't have ears. You know you two got a serious attitude problem. Debrief these civilians, Sergeant. Hey, Colonel, convict on the line named John Kutner. Says he wants to talk to you. Twenty years later and clowns are still running the circus. Lieutenant Colonel Johnson, Army National Guard, whoever the hell you are, you're unauthorized to be using this line. Listen up, shit for brains. If you try a stunt like that again, there's gonna be a bloodbath here the likes of which you've never seen. Keep your fucking soldier boys out of my face. I'll have my friends here start killing us some hostages. You got it? Don't you try and dictate terms to me, mister. You wanna play hard ball? Well, we're playing it. Shut the fuck up. Hey, Ace! Want to go back to the bus? Keep a look out. Anything moves out there, you come tell me. Yes, sir, General. I don't know, John. How're we gonna get out of this one? I mean, we can't hold out here forever. If you got a plan, I'd sure like to hear it. Building over there, what's it used for? Well, that used to be the mine's processing plant. I mean, they use it a little bit now. I don't know... Why? Wait till dark then we'll change address. SERGEANT: Ten-hut! The son of a bitch wants to get tough. He's messing with the wrong soldier. Corporal, get me battalion headquarters, I'm calling in some armor. Oh.This guy's beautiful. Let's see how these derelicts act to a 105mm tank. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [HOOTING] Move along, little doggies! Ha! Ha! This is perfect. Yes. You can see everything. Fundamentals, Patch, always control the high ground. Listen up. Hmm? I know a way out of here. I think I got it figured out. First thing tomorrow, we'll have a helicopter right here. Then we'll take ourselves on a little one-way trip to Mexico. Mexico?Yeah, I'll talk to Hernandez. He used to run snort out of a weedhopper down there. Hey, John, I'll tell you what, that all sounds real good but, I mean, ain't no way everybody's gonna fit in one helicopter. Oh, yeah. Who's talking about everybody? The fewer, the better. Now I'm reserving you a seat on that shuttle, amigo. [LAUGHING] I guess. You keep your mouth shut and you'll be taking the next siesta sur del frontera, south of the border. Why don't we give Colonel Klink a call and give him the good news? All right. [LAUGHS] Hey, senorKlink. [BOTH LAUGHING] Chopper, my ass. That derelict thinks he's gonna fly out of here, he better think again. I'll tell you what. I kid you not, Sergeant, if he thinks he's leaving here in the morning, he's in for a big surprise. Tomorrow morning at sunbreak I'm gonna kick me some convict butt big time. Colonel. There's another way to do this, a better way. Let me go in there alone and try and take them out. [SCOFFS] And you call me brilliant. I've done covert infiltration before, Colonel, during the Vietnam War. Yeah, you Vietnam cowboys, you think you know it all, don't you? No, I don't think I know it all but I do know if you go in there shooting again, a lot of innocent people are gonna wind up dead. Well, that remains to be seen, doesn't it? What is it with you? What have you got to lose? It's my skin. If I make it none of the hostages get hurt, if I don't, well, you can still do it your way. Just give me till the deadline, what do you say? I say you stay out of my face, son, I'll have these state boys arrest you. You know I served under officers like you, they were real good at one thing, killing people with incompetence. Mmm-hmm. So what is it with you, kid? You're a glory boy? You think you're some kind of war hero? The war is over for you, soldier. Why don't you just take a seat on the bench and let us clean this mess up? Excuse me, sir. This is the Senator. Colonel Johnson, Senator Way. I was in the area and the governor asked me to stop and check out the situation. Well, as you can see, I've got everything in total control. That should do it. Three hours till light. I'm cutting it close. Yeah. This don't bring back memories. 881 with Captain Depp. Indian territory. Remember the flag raising? Mickey would blow the last note on that bugle and we'd all run for cover. The fourth of July every day. Ooh, baby. You know, Billy, you don't have to do this. If I didn't wanna do it, I wouldn't do it. We stick together, LT. Just like always. I don't wanna hear anymore about it. Hand me some of that stuff. Gotcha. [LAUGHS] [SIGHS] [INAUDIBLE] Well, now we're in business. Patch, you there? [RADIO BUZZING] Patch, it's Ace. Sounds like there's a tank out there. Patch. Talk to me. Who's up there? Come on down. Evening. Something's wrong. There's no guard. Yeah. Come on. Ain't this a bitch? We just got out of fucking jail. [SIGHS] I'm telling you, this is Kutner's way of sticking it to us. Fucking guy thinks he's commander-in-chief. Just shut up, would you? Look, you know, he got us in this mess, he sure as hell better get us out. Where do you think they took him? Only one way to find out. Shh. Smitty? Smitty, you okay? Come on, Smitty, stop screwing around. [GROANS] Excuse me, I hope you don't mind, but I need you to stay put for a minute. [SNORING] While I was up there on the roof, I was looking at this picture. I came to the conclusion you're one beautiful bitch. The longer I looked at this picture, the hornier old Johnny got. You know what I decided? I decided I want some. [SCOFFS]Oh, that's right, pretty lady. You're a grown woman. You know what I'm talking about. If a man's been in jail as long as me, he has to do without certain pleasures. It's been a long time since I've had a bitch as pretty as you. Yeah. Yeah, I think I want some. No, Papa. Papa, no! Sit down, old man. Don't do it. I don't know... There's just something about dark hair bitches. That little girl... She had dark hair just like you. They all did. My mother was a brunette. You know the kind I'm talking about, right? What do you figure, shrink? Think it means something? Whoa, now, you just relax, Conchita. Attagirl. Beautiful. So beautiful. You know, I must have done 30, 40, just like you. Hell, I did six in one month. Three over a long weekend. Let's see now. That was in July 1968. [CHUCKLING] July of 1969. You wanna know how I did them, Doc? Really very simple. I just took hold to their throats like this. [GROANS] Twisted their necks like little puppies. [BANGING AT DOOR] PATCH: Hey, John. Hey, John, it's important. Yeah? [STUTTERING] I'm sorry, man, but something's wrong. I can't raise Ace. Maybe he's asleep but I don't think so. IKE: Is it just me, sweet pea? Or these guys look like they belong here? You're right about that. Now, I'm just gonna ask you one more time. Where did he take the hostages? Why don't you eat shit and die? That was rude, Smitty. Wasn't that rude, Billy? BILLY: Extremely rude. You see, Smitty, when my fingers come together you're gonna have a real problem. Medical science calls it a crushed larynx. That ain't healthy, is it, doctor? No. No, it is not.[COUGHS] You know, Smitty, I think it's really wonderful you're willing to die for your friends.[STRUGGLING] I know they'd be more than happy to do the same thing for you. [HOARSELY] Okay. All right. I'll tell you. [GROANING] I sure hope those boys don't catch cold. Know how to use that thing? My mother was full-blooded Cherokee, it's in the genes. All right, Cochise. [WHISPERING] Come on, let's go. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] About to have our cover blown. Want me to take them out? No, we don't have time to double back. Let's just keep moving. Ace. Yo, Ace! Ace! He's probably back at the station. [MUFFLED VOICES] What is... What happened to you guys? PATCH OVER RADIO: John. John, you there? Hey, John. Hey, John, you there? Yeah, yeah, yeah, what is it? John, the same two guys, that bagged Smitty and Albert before are back again, man. And this time they nailed Ace, too. They locked them in the cell and lost the key. So what do we do? Just leave them there and get back here. All right. Kutner knows what he's doing. A man would need wings to reach that top floor. I don't know about you but I lost mine years ago in a Bronx whorehouse. It's your call, LT. How do we get inside? I don't know. Walk in I guess. Walk in? How're we gonna do that? Front door. Stupid question. Patch? Is that you, Patch? [GRUNTS] Come on. I said watch the goddamn hostages. You're dumber than spit. All right, boys, let's go. We got a little hunting to do. Move. Move. I want you to stay here, all right. Watch these people. If any one of them moves, blow them all to hell. You got that? Absolutely. [WHISTLES] John. John, more bad news, man. I'm out here in front of the building, Carlos is dead. JT's out cold. Those guys are inside and you got company coming, man. All right, there's only one way up here. It's up those stairs. If you see those motherfuckers, blow them away. [GUN COCKS] I've been meaning to ask you, Cochise. Have we got a plan? Hell, no. We're making it up as we go along. [SIGHING] Fuck. That's what I figured. Evening. Do you mind dropping that rifle? Sorry, LT, I gotta make some noise. [GUNSHOTS][ARROW WHOOSHES] [GROANING] John. John! They're coming up there, man. They're coming up. Saul's shot in the head. They got Scully. Shit! Coming up. Get yourselves ready. You think they know we're here? There is that possibility. [CHUCKLES] Okay.Let's go. All right, listen up. I'm pulling up zero hour. We're going in at 0600. That's seven minutes. Now, according to police intelligence... Let's hope to hell it's accurate. They've moved these hostages into this building. They're somewhere on one of these five floors. That means we're flying in blind. Sergeant Conlan.Sir. Your squad will be dropped here. You'll go down from that point till you either make contact with the enemy, or the captives. I'll bring in the rest of the platoon. Is that understood? Yes, sir.Yes, sir. All right, gentlemen. Let's go kick 'em in the end zone. [PANTING] Smell it? They're out there, all right. You wanna go first? [CHUCKLES] I think I got a plan. Well, it's about time. You remember that ambush at Lang Vei, how the Cong set us up with that sniper? Oh, yeah, the old Sergeant York routine. And we fell for it. They tore the shit out of us. Throw me some cover. I'm gonna go for that position over there. And hunt me some grouse. Wanna get their heads down. You do your John Wayne. You got it, LT. Keep your pecker high and your powder dry, my friend. Okay.
