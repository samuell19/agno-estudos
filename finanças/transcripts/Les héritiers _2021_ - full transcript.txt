The person you are trying to reach is not available. Leave your message after the beep. Hello, Diane? It's Stan again. So, you're not answering anymore? We're starting to feel a little lost here without you. We miss our supreme leader... That's not the best comparison, but... you know what I mean. Clients are begging for you. They miss you already. Seriously though, call us back. We're getting a little worried. Take care. EXECUTIVE PRODUCER PATRICE ONFRAY Hello. -Hello, Sandra. -Hello, Stan. How are you? -Your client is here. -Already? -Thank you. -You're welcome. Artemis Agency. Hello. THE HEIRS They're going to crucify me! No. Hiding your mistakes is the worst mistake. Here. Here's a press release with three key words: transparency, reassurance, and anticipation. Stanislas, you're telling me that I should acknowledge to the media that my bank lost 150 million in assets because a trader took a piss at a bad time? Exactly. With a few adjustments. I'm not sure if "took a piss at a bad time" is necessary. I have to tell you...I'm not sure. That's fine. Think about it, but quickly. Admitting something too late is as dangerous as denying it too soon. Listen, I came to Artemis to consult with Diane Granger. I need to speak with her directly. She's away. She explicitly told me not to disturb her. I'm sorry. She isn't going to the awards tonight? If she does, I'll be as surprised as you! I'll let Sandra walk you out. Mr. Barlier, believe me. The situation is serious, but not hopeless. Trust me. -See you tonight? -See you tonight. Stop, stop. Are you kidding? We just started! You've been demolishing me for half an hour. Come on, let's go one round. You let me win! Come on! Give it all you've got. Nest time...I can't right now. You're really on today. Changing jobs does that to you. You should try it. Going from journalist to director of communications? It's been six months! You still can't get it in your head. It's hard. It's as if an environmental militant went to work for Monsanto! It's fine, I'm not naked! I wanted to change the world, Marc. No one cares about journalists. Half the population doesn't trust them. You know that? So? So? So communication is what changes the world today. And you think that's good news? I know there are quite a few who use it for questionable reasons. -But I... -You're the exception, is that it? It's won't be you that's used, you'll use it. Absolutely. Lunch? No, I can't. I'm already late for a meeting. Then how about dinner? So, how did training go this week? Good. -Tell me about it. -I scored a goal. -How many? -Just one. -I hit it while it was in the air. -No way! Into the top corner. -Really? -Yeah. Look, there's mom. Wow, that's great. -What's that? -Uncle bought it for me. Here, take these. Come on, go! I'm coming. -Thanks, uncle. -You're welcome, kiddo. -See you soon. -See you soon. Don't buy him shoes. He'll think he's someone he's not, like you. -Relax, it's just a tracksuit. -A hundred-dollar tracksuit? Well, I won't ask you up. I'm sure you're busy. Yeah. Hey...how is Karim? Have you heard anything? Why don't you ask him yourself? The prison's too far from you? I'm sorry. Hello? Yes, Stan. -Yes, I know. I had a meeting. -Yeah, that's right... I'm on my way. Yes. I have to go. Bye. Was she threatened? Yes. Someone she passed over for the head of a company on the CAC 40. How long ago? I hadn't come to the agency yet. She told me about it. I'd say seven or eight years. Diane works with important businessmen, politicians from France, from abroad as well. It's easy to get on the wrong side of people. Excuse me. Mehdi, this is Captain Humbert. He's a friend of a friend. He's agreed to help us. -Thank you for coming. -You're welcome. I had a colleague in Vannes. For now, there's not enough to warrant opening an investigation. Her phone hasn't been found, her boat wasn't lost at sea... We haven't heard from her in a week. Do you know how many people disappear voluntarily every year? -Five thousand. -No, wait. She's not like that. She wasn't... Diane isn't depressed. You don't have to be depressed. In most cases, the obstacle is money. And in this case, I understand that isn't a problem. En plus, elle n'a pas d'enfants ni de conjoint... And she doesn't have any children or a partner. I can check the activity on her phone and her bank account. That's it. -Well, that's not bad. Thank you. -It's not a problem. Will you keep us updated? If we find her, and she doesn't want to come back, I won't be able to tell you. That's the law. It's her right. -Have a nice day. -Goodbye. Have a nice day. Well. In the meantime, we have nine cases ongoing, eighteen upcoming... Mehdi, what's up with Maréchal-Dampierre? -Excuse me? -What? Do you want us to stop everything? Tell Barlier it's over? He's lost 150 million euros, and everyone's after him. That's not what I'm saying! Of course not! Just because you're the most senior, doesn't mean you can take Diane's place. Oh, OK. So what do you propose? You want to start a co-op? That's not what I'm saying. Hey, guys! Stop! I'm on edge, too. Let's calm down. We have something else to worry about right now. The awards show. What should we say? The truth? Diane is Artemis. Without her, there is no agency. Officially, she's still here. -OK? -Yes. Mehdi? OK. I haven't seen Diane. She's not here yet? She decided to take a getaway. Diane? A getaway? She's never missed the awards. You know Diane. Not one for routine! I've been getting her machine all week... today it was full. Diane's machine fills up quickly. That's why she needs to unplug sometimes. Just a few days of rest at her house in Morbihan. Sick? That word's not in her vocabulary. I haven't seen her sick once in five years. I hear you contacted the police. -Excuse me? -You contacted the police. What're you talking about? Diane's been missing for a week! If we were reported missing every time we took a vacation... I have contacts in Bretagne. Her boat is still there, but her... Rumors. The bane of any communications firm. Easy to spread, impossible to eradicate. Wouldn't it be easier to just admit it? What's the problem? Is this a trial? If Diane has disappeared, we have the right to know. This is crazy. She's fine. -With her... it's possible. -I mean... at worst... -Hey! Thanks for leaving us. -They were getting to me. Damn, Mehdi! We agreed. Don't you see what kind of message this sends? -Good evening, Stanislas. -Mr. Barlier. I can't stay with Artemis, given the circumstances. Given my situation... it would be a classic PR... Can I give you a ride? I was going to take a taxi, but why not? Good evening. Shall we? Damn. Valliant is going to sign him. OK, we have to get back. Damage control. Yeah. God damn. I'm telling you sincerely that you're making a mistake. Think of all that we've accomplished these past few months. Hello. Can I speak to Mr. Dupré? Yes... Yes, again. Are you sure? OK. We'll give you two weeks to think it over. We had a meeting two days ago, and Mister... Hello? Come by the office, and we can talk it over... Yes. Yes, I understand. OK, so with Lorenzi, Dupré, and now Dampierre, we've lost over 75% of our clients. -What does that mean? -It means... 1,103,584 euros lost. How's our cash flow? Well, if we keep going like this, we'll be closed in six months. I'm sorry to interrupt... Claire, your meeting. Thanks, Sandra. Are you coming? I want introduce you to someone. My name is Agnès Moreau. I live in Amiens. I'm a technician at the Larcher lab. Do you know it? Yes. It's the second biggest lab. The director is the Larcher heir, right? That's right. Five years ago, they released a new medication, Cantarax. It's supposed to help with issues related to heart valves, but they realized that it was also an effective painkiller. So doctors started prescribing it for back pain, arthritis, even for cancer. People started to talk, there were newspaper articles, and suddenly, everyone was on Cantarax. What's the problem? The side effects. It can cause cardiac problems, fatal ones. Tell them how you found out. I stumbled upon a test. A test that wasn't sent to the ANSM, the national medical association. Larcher deliberately hid the risks? I'm sure of it. I'm convinced. He did it to get the drug on the market. Cardiac valve issues affect about 6,000 people in France. If 1% of that 6,000 have side effects, it's not noticeable. But if Cantarax is prescribed as a painkiller, then... There are millions of people taking it. Many more potential victims. Why didn't the lab do anything when they saw it was being prescribed for other things? There's too much money at stake. They have millions of clients. To go back to 6,000... Did you bring it up internally? My boss played deaf, and my colleagues avoided me, those cowards. I was fired for incompetence. I can't get unemployment. Now, I'm on welfare. And how did you end up here? Agnès remembered something I wrote for News 24. -OK. -She contacted me. -Could you excuse us for a minute? -Sure. Thank you. You want to take her on? If we don't help her, Larcher will get away. Claire, do I need to remind you that we represent firms like Larcher. Not whistleblowers. We're not lawyers. We don't do social justice. Who said anything about social justice? I'm talking about PR! Our PR. What do you mean? To show people that we're still here. An employee against a firm on the CAC 40. It's David and Goliath. People will be talking about Artemis. How is she going to pay us? Didn't you hear Henri? -It's risky. -Risky? It's suicidal! It's out of the question! -So now you're in charge? -No, but... Listen. There are three of us. Let's vote. OK? OK, we'll vote. Who's in favor? You're crazy. We're going to ask you some personal questions. We have to know everything. Do you understand? Yes. My mother was a cleaning woman, and My father worked for Goodyear, but they supported my studies. "We want you to be better than us." That was the constant refrain. I was bored to death. One day, I saw a report on Pasteur, and something clicked. As you can see, I didn't become Pasteur, but my parents were happy. No, I'm not married. I was only with Larcher for a year and a half, but it was the longest job I'd had. Before that, it was six months. I don't know why, but middle managers don't like me... No, I'm not in a union. No inions defended me when I was fired. I can't stand what they do to us. The banks, the labs... it has to stop. They have to pay, those bastards. Well, there's a lot of work to do. Big mouth, no family, not a union member. She's not a crowd-pleaser. It's a change from crooked bankers, huh? I have an idea, if you're interested. NEWS 24 Hello. How are you, Henri? Nostalgic. A bit. Seeing my office. But I can assure you, it won't last. MARC TESSIER EDITOR IN CHIEF Still no word from your boss? No. I don't want to talk about that. I do. -Marc! -Everyone's talking. I don't have any news about Diane. Seriously. There's nothing... What do you think about what I sent you? The evidence is scant. Your whistleblower has a blurry screenshot. Going up against a bulldozer like Larcher with that... Do you remember the Mediator? 5,000 cases, 2,000 dead, state involvement. I'm offering you a scoop like that. The Larcher story! Marc, this girl... she won't give up. I'm giving you an exclusive interview. A test. If they don't bite, we drop it. But if they bite... you'll have been the first. It's tempting. I have to talk to the boss. I get to choose the photo, OK? OK. I'm at the interview, and I review it before publication. Do you want to write the questions for me too? Seriously, Claire, do you take me for your employee? You use to hate this kind of thing. I can always go somewhere else, if you want. So? CANTARAX Sandra? Good evening, Stan. You seem surprised to see me. Yes, I thought it was a courier. Ah. A courier? No. A messenger, perhaps. Are you alone? You work late. -Yes, sometimes. -That's good. You've taken on someone named Agnès Moreau. -Who? -Don't play with me, Stan. If I were you, I'd think again. I'm here to let you know that Larcher Labs has requested my services. Régis, it's late, and I have a lot of work to do. -So if... -You've already lost. Trust me. Stan, you're young and talented. You have your future ahead of you. From now on, the future is Vaillant Consulting. -Since Diane is no longer here. -Who told you that? You know something? If I did, I certainly wouldn't share it with you. Of course not. No, not in her office! The aquarium is still here. The little fish. The discussions we had in here. OK, that's enough of that. Please leave! 2002! Chirac - Jospin. We weren't on the same side, but... what a time! It's a difficult legacy to carry. Who do you have on your side? A young man, full of ambition, who wants people to forget where he came from, and a righter of wrongs, who thinks that she's going to use PR to change the world? It won't work. It's never going to work. If you come work for me, I'll make you an associate. Who knows? Maybe you'll be president one day. What makes you think that... I don't think anything, but you should think about it. No need to walk me out. I know the way. Last point: don't talk about what you think -about... -Can't we be less formal? OK. Very well. Don't talk about unions. It's your first interview. The message must be clear. If you criticize the lab and the unions, it will blur the message. So, I shouldn't say what I think. Not everything you think. Not at the same time. Can we take a break? -It's time. -Can I smoke? Two minutes. If someone had told me I'd be in a place like this one day... Not easy to go from one world to another, is it? Even when you're moving up. How did you get here? You can't tell me you were born in this neighborhood. I'm going to get a coffee. Do you want one? I'm sorry. I can be clumsy. No, don't worry. It's nothing. Coffee? No, thank you. -Agnès, -Yes. Are you ready? Claire's waiting. OK, I'm coming. -Sorry. -Don't worry. Good evening. Have a nice evening. You're welcome. Have a nice evening, sir. Good evening. Have a nice time. Hello. Thank you. Have a nice evening, sir. Go ahead. You're welcome. Excuse me, sir. -Mister. -Mister what? I just passed the bar exam today. Your invitation. I just gave it to you. Go ahead. Have a nice evening. -Good evening. -To you as well. Hello, sir. Excuse me. -Good evening. -Good evening. What is it? Wild Alaskan salmon, sir. -May I? -Of course. It's better with champagne. Try this. To daring. Excuse me? I saw you come in without an invitation. Well done. What's it to you? I prefer to know the people to whom I extend invitations. Diane Granger. Can you come by my office tomorrow morning? Are you serious? I told you. I like people who are daring. Where did you go Mehdi? Excuse me? Your head is in the clouds. In my case, Sandra, in my case. Artemis Agency. Hello. -Larcher called Valliant. -What? Yeah. Valliant told me yesterday. More like he warned me. At least we know who we're facing. What do you think about Agnès? It's not a done deal, but it's possible. -It depends on Claire. -Yeah. No kids, no partner... She's an independent woman who is dedicated to her job. A modern woman. Not in a union. She's autonomous. She's from a modest background, but she did well in school. That shows that she's ambitious, hard-working. -She doesn't owe anyone anything. -Yes. So, to sum up, who is Agnès Moreau? -She's honest. -Independent. Modest, and at the same time, altruistic. Yes. A woman who is decent, humble, and trustworthy. That's better. -It's great. -I don't know about that, but... Can you put your hair up? It's perfect. Perfect! I don't feel that comfortable. It's like a costume. Yeah... OK. This'll work. OK, so... we're good. -Not bad, yeah. -We're good. A little bit... Oh, that's good. One more? CANTARAX: HEALTH SCANDAL? The story was picked up by the press, it's been all over the television, and there are hashtags on social media like "Larcher scandal" and "Cantarax." Same on the search engines. It's working, Claire. You were right. Well, you look happy... Oh, no. It's great. I'm just thinking about the retaliation. He's right. We have to think ahead. I'm sure Vaillant is working on his counterattack. Can't we celebrate for five minutes while we wait for it? If Diane were here we would be toasting with champagne. Speaking of Diane, I looked around her office the other night. You should have waited for us. There was no one else here. It just happened... So? Did you find anything? Nothing. Just work stuff. She keeps everything. But nothing personal. That's Diane. I'll call the police in a day or two to see where they are. Well, I have to go. See you tomorrow. -Goodbye. -Bye. -Sweetie! -Hi, Mom. -They're beautiful! -How are you? Good, and you? Thanks. Come in. Your whistleblower doesn't need an agent, she needs a lawyer. A good one. This amuses you, attacking a business that employs hundreds of people? That depends on how they do that. Pass me your mother's plate. She likes the white meat, like me. And your boss has disappeared. Unbelievable! You could have at least taken her place. That's not how it works, Dad. Oh really? So how does it work? You want to be an employee for the rest of your life? Christelle, a thigh? Thank you. I think you're going to get slaughtered. Are we betting? Amaury, a thigh? Thank you. And it seems you don't have the time for anything else. -I'm fine, Dad. -What? Well, we haven't seen you with a girlfriend in a while. What was the last one's name? Clémence? Pierre! No, he's right. I don't have the time right now. At your age, I worked more than you and had two kids. Look at your brother. The wings are OK? Thank you. Enjoy. -Thank you. -Thank you. Enjoy. And now for the news about Cantarax, revealed by a technician at the Larcher lab. We investigated. Take a look. In June, she disappeared. With no reason given. And it wasn't paid leave. I can remember three days in April. That bastard! He knows I was taking care of my father. She was always going on about Cantarax. You couldn't ask her a question without her talking about it. It was like a conspiracy, or harassment. Yes, we worked together. We worked with the samples. There are very strict protocols here. I'm not a doctor. Neither is she. Vaillant's really raking it in. Larcher Labs, under the direction of the founder's son, has not responded to requests for comm... Agnès, Agnès, are you OK? They're just trying to intimidate you. They're flexing their muscles. We're used to it. My parents are going to see this. I need to go smoke. I'll go with you. We're used to it? I have friends who could tell a different story. No, no. No way. You don't have to prove your credibility. The focus has to be Cantarax. That's what's important. How many victims have you found? A dozen. We should go see them, don't you think? I still have connections at the Assembly. Mehdi, I'd like to come with you to meet them. Um... I don't know if that's a good idea. I think it is. It's a great idea. Damn, third refusal in a row. Damn! Now, we're going to... Mr. and Mrs. Dupuis Number 11, rue des Fleurs. Here it is. It reminds me of my parent's house. I hope it will bring us luck. Shall we bet? Hello Mrs. Dupuis. We spoke on the phone. Come in. That's when it fell on me. My vertebral column held up. I'm a tough guy. Afterwards, he suffered terribly. And the medicine didn't do anything. Until Cantarax. It was like magic. I felt like I was waking up again. Then, I felt out of breath all the time. Six months ago, I came up from the basement and found him lying on the ground. Thankfully, the ambulance came quickly. Five minutes later, and I would have been gone. And what did your doctor say? That I should lose weight. That's it? Mr. Dupuis, I really think it would be good if you spoke to the newspapers. -See? He's a journalist. -Not exactly. So what do you do? Don't worry. I'll explain everything. What I want you to understand it that the world should know what happened to you. It's very important. There are a lot of people in this situation. We don't want any trouble. We don't know anything about it. Mr. Dupuis, I understand. You may not know about it, but you have something to say. You're the one who had the heart attack. I didn't want to be in the paper either. I wanted to move things forward, so I didn't have a choice. I think she's right, André. You owe me a drink. Maëla Degreffe instructed everyone to block it. That's governmental solidarity. Stan? Hey, how are you? Hey, what's up? -So, you going after Barlier? -No, no. You never know, huh? See you. So, what can I do for you? Nothing illegal, I hope. Does your deputy still have his business or has he retired? No, he's still working. Officially, at least. You know how it goes. Have you heard about Cantarax? A bit. Why? Do you know if the drug agency was given any instructions or there were any meetings with lobbyists? I can find out. Well, I have to go. I have a meeting. -We'll keep in touch. -OK. Stan? Wow, don't look so happy to see me. I'm sorry. I wasn't expecting it. I work here, remember? Yes. Just passing through? I'm sorry I never responded to your messages. The ones from sixth months ago? -I had a lot of work... -It's OK. Don't worry on my account. You have your family to think about. So... How are you? Are you asking if I was able to get over you? What are you doing here anyway? Looking for information about something. I can help, if you want. It's not really official... it could cause trouble. Even better. Tell me about it. It could get you in trouble, I mean. If it's for you, I don't care. Under one condition: you ask me to dinner. THE TWO MUSEUMS -To the Dupuis family! -To the Dupuis family. You never told me how you ended up at Artemis. OK. I worked in fast food for five years to pay for school. When I got my first paycheck, I took my parents to a nice restaurant. And my dad refused to let me pay. He told me to save my money for books. But deep down, he was ashamed. Ashamed that he'd never been able to take us somewhere like that. At the time, I blamed myself, but... I know that you understand. Am I wrong? I never worked at McDonald's. Maybe I should have. Go on. My brother was not a very respectable person. He dealt drugs. A lot of drugs. And I was the lookout. -You did what? -I was his lookout. -What's that? -I kept an eye out for cops. I got a small cut. Four years ago, he asked me to help him out one more time, like before. I was studying law, and it was hard. And the job was super well paid. So, I said yes. But that night, the cops did a big raid. I didn't see them. It was too late. Whistling would have given me away, so I didn't do anything. And that night, my brother got arrested. Voila. And what about you? Are your parents proud of what you're doing? Yes. So far, anyway. -Now they're afraid I'll talk. -I see. Where I come from, you don't make waves. Like the Dupuis. So even though I know I'm right, I don't know whether I should talk. You're right, Agnès. I'm telling you you're right. Thank you. We can keep work separate from the rest, right? Not in this line of work. If anyone were to see us... Come on, then. OK. Congrats on the Dupuis. It's good we have them. They're the only ones who agreed. If we make the cover of Match with them, it's all we need. How'd it go with Agnès? Great. You weren't sure at first. So? The cops didn't find anything. No financial activity, nothing on the cell phone. Damn. But according to Humbert, for someone like Diane, it's not hard to get a bank account in Geneva or Malta. And she could be using prepaid cell phones. So what are they going to do? I asked them to warn the prosecutor, but they don't seem to be in a hurry. Larcher's press conference got pushed up. It's now. -Now, now? -It's starting. I'm speaking out today because I have been the object of disgusting attacks. Of course, they are unfounded. Through my business, it is I alone who am being targeted. I had an affair, with my accuser, Agnès Moreau. No! It lasted for a year. I broke it off six months ago to keep my family together. I made a mistake, and I asked my family to forgive me for having put them through that. But Ms. Moreau didn't accept the breakup. She's been threatening me ever since, to, and I quote, "Make my life a nightmare." I have proof of what I'm saying, and I'm giving it to the investigators for the investigation regarding the charges I filed this morning for harassment and threats. Sandra. -I'll call a driver to go get her. -OK. -Should she come here? -Yes. This has nothing to do with Cantarax, or with Larcher Labs. This is about Agnès Moreau. This is about vengeance. Thank you. -Mr. Larcher! -Mr. Larcher, one question! That's it for today. Thank you for coming. Is Larcher lying? You don't believe me about Cantarax? That's not the question, Agnès. So now I'm being accused! Damn! Agnès, this isn't complicated. Is Larcher lying? Yes or no? Yes. And no. I met Larcher at a business seminar. We crossed paths getting coffee, I made a stupid joke, he laughed, and he invited me to dinner. He said he was unhappily married. We started seeing each other in secret. Keep going. It was the same old story. A year in, I knew he'd never leave his wife. So I left. But he started to harass me. What about Cantarax? I was naive. I thought he didn't know. When I told him my concerns, things started to get worse. He threatened me and had me followed. -Do you have proof? -No, I don't have proof. It was always on the phone or in person. Why didn't you tell us? It's none of your damn business! It's my private life! There is no private anymore. Didn't you notice? Do you know what you did? You've ruined our business. And probably your life too. Stan, that's enough. Enough? No, that's not enough, Claire! I told you we shouldn't do this! Stan, stop! Stop it. You thought this was a mistake too! You didn't want her! -Watch how you talk to me. -What are you going to do? -Look. -Good. Get out! Go screw yourself! WE NEED TO MEET, NOW!!! Larcher is suing us for defamation. All the outlets are jumping on us. All they had to do was verify the information themselves. That's what ruins this business... I was fired, Claire. -What? -How could you do this to me? I didn't force you to do it. You could've said no! You said you only cared about changing the world. So you used that girl, and you used me. I didn't have to ask twice. Claire! Don't make it worse! I trusted you! I'm an idiot, too. I had a feeling there was something off. You forgot how to do this job. You switched teams quickly. You're a storyteller now? You do fake news? Are you going to keep rubbing this in my face? I apologized, so give it a rest. No, I don't think I will. I'm going to miss you, Claire. We're done. I would love to work with you. You realized it's better to influence ten papers than to write for one. It's hard to say no to that. -You know what I like most about you? -No. Your charm. Thank you. I was hoping you would say my writing or... my ability. When I would say stupid things, my grandmother always told me: "Don't act like a child, Diane." Message received. Seduction. It's everywhere. When you ask a salesperson a question, when a cop gives you a ticket, and when you go on a job interview, obviously. Seduction is the name of the game. That's life. But you already knew that. Right, Claire? Maybe. Understand, seduce, influence... but never betray. You could have said something sooner. You would have told the others and ruined everything. It has nothing to do with Cantarax. I promise. Are you jealous? No, I don't think so. Disappointed, more like. "Larcher: a cheap farce!" "The Cantarax drama!" And so on. Now it's all "false accusations" and "unreliable witnesses." What matters is what we do now. What would Diane do? She would have let it go. If a client lies to you that's the end. Except now we don't have a choice. If we backtrack, we'll lose the little credibility we have. We have to run at the wall. Stop looking for the negative. The focus is Cantarax. We have to get back to that. Yes. We're sure she didn't lie about that? What's gotten in to you, Claire? You're the one who introduced us to her! You convinced us to do this. What do you think about her and Larcher? Not too jealous? What are you talking about? When were you going to tell us you're sleeping with her? That's crazy. Who told you that? I saw you. Last night, after the news conference. Damn, what did you do? It's stupid to begin with, but if the press finds out, we're dead. All right. I made a mistake. Put Vaillant's spin on that, and we'll be reading about how Larcher is a victim of a conspiracy. Didn't you think? Cut it out with your shitty lessons on morality, OK? We can't cut it out. But we can cut you out. Since when are you the boss? Stan is right. It's better if we go on without you. You need to avoid being seen together while this is going on, not for us, but for Diane. You really are a bastard. -We have no time to waste. -Yeah. I contacts Paris Match, like my colleague said. Speaking of, where is he? Why didn't he come? He's on vacation. But we work together. May I come in? I'll explain. The young woman who was here before, she lied. So... No, she didn't lie. Not about Cantarax. The story she told... it was to get revenge, wasn't it? To get revenge? OK, I have to go. -Claire? -Yeah. We lost the Dupuis family. Oh, damn. I think Larcher contacted them. Why do you think that? Mrs. Dupuis, she used the word "revenge" specifically. Larcher must have pressured them. OK. -I got us on Massart's show. -Massart? That's great, but risky! It's double or nothing. Yeah, yeah. Double or nothing, but we'll need Agnès. It'll happen. It'll happen. Stan. I'm sorry, I need to go. -OK. See you later. -Bye. Sorry. Your father just called. He'll be here in half an hour. What? OK, thanks. You didn't want me to come up? No. I was coming out anyway. So, what did you want to tell me? Your mother is worried. You know her, she says nothing, but... She worries. -There's nothing to worry about. -Stanislas, please. I appreciate you wanting to stand tall. But sometimes you have to be honest. -Meaning? -You know very well what I mean. Your agency is like the Titanic. If you were the captain, I might understand, but You're going to ruin your life for... for what? For a boss who up and left? Is it mom who's worried, or... you that's worried I'll tarnish your name. Rest assured. I'm getting out of this. You don't think I can? So... tell Mom to stop worrying. Stanislas! Don't disappoint her. You can go. We can see each other at my place. Or yours! Can't we figure it out? Agnès, you need to understand how dangerous it is. I'm sorry. I won't be able to keep going. -I won't be able to go on. OK? -Don't say that. You have to go all the way, OK? You can trust Claire and Stan. They're the ones that don't trust me! What are you going to do? Don't worry about me. Of course I worry. This job is your life. Exactly. Maybe it was taking up too much space. I have to go. Mehdi... It'll be OK. I promise you. It's been a long time. No longer ashamed of me? I'm sorry, Karim. I was busy. And you're not anymore? Because of your boss disappearing? Yeah, I read the papers too. No, it's not because of that. Then why did you come? To apologize, Karim. To tell you that I'm sorry. I screwed up, Karim. Mehdi, hey! Look at me, Mehdi. I'm glad the cops didn't get you. I've got that criminal look. And your job? They fired me. That makes sense. -You're not from their world. -Don't say that, Karim. It's me. I screwed it up. You're blind, Mehdi. I'm telling you. So what are you going to do now? I don't know. Seriously, you can't be so hard on yourself. Do something, get moving. Look at you. Find another job, or start a business. I don't know. Or find your boss. -My boss? -Yeah. She trusted you, didn't she? You owe her this. But that's a job for the cops. Even they can't find her. The cops? The cops don't know her like you do. OK Agnès, let's go over it one more time. Do you have any proof? Why didn't the national administration notice anything? I don't know. Maybe because the tests were falsified? You had an affair with the head of the lab, Paul Larcher, who says that your claim is nothing but personal vengeance. He's lying. No, no. Don't say "he's lying." We already talked about this. Right now, in the eyes of the public, you're the liar. I know... I know that I should have said something about it, but I thought that it would... "In good faith." I thought in good faith. Go ahead, start again. I thought, in good faith, that it would obscure the focus. We told you to recite it. Try, or no one will believe you. Maybe for people to believe me, I need to be myself, instead of playing a role. -Yes! Yes, you are. -No! It's important that you use the language -here. -I don't care about that. I want to tell the truth. Period. I'm the one going on TV! I can't. I'm going to get some air. OK, let's take a break. Good evening, Stan. -Hello. -So? Did you consider my offer? Yes. But I need to know one thing. You don't have any doubts about Larcher's story? Because she told us that he was the one harassing her. I don't know, and I don't care. What really happened is immaterial. Moreau, Larcher, you, me, we each have our own truth. There are as many truths as people in the world. The only one that matters is the one people believe. -Whether it's true or not? -Exactly. And because people believe it, it becomes the truth. Not the inverse. It's as simple as that. That's why we're going to win. You've lost this one, but in a position tailored to you, you would work miracles. My offer stands. Get on board while there's time. I'm a patient man, but I won't wait forever. -I'll get back to you. -I'm counting on it. Stan, if there's one thing you need to learn is that this job doesn't require you to cut off your emotions. I failed, I know. It's my fault. There's no blame, Stan. You mustn't cut yourself off from your emotions. Whether it's in your professional life, or your private life. Of course I guessed it. You can love whomever you want, it's not up to your father to decide. Claire? We need to change our strategy. STAN FOYARD FILE 118 RUE DE BASSANO FRIDAY NOVEMBER 6TH LUNCH? -Do we have the credits? -Yes. Good. THE BIG DEBATE -Hello. -Hello. Rolling in two minutes. Virginie, tell him to hurry up. -Ewan, hurry up, please. -Thank you. -You OK? -Yeah. I think it's going to work. -Ten seconds. -OK. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three... Thank you for staying with us. I'm speaking now to the woman at the heart of the allegations about Cantarax. -Agnès Moreau, hello. -Hello. Starting with the challenging questions, you had an affair with Paul Larcher, which you hid. Doesn't that discredit your accusations? I know that I should have said something about it, of course. I thought, in good faith, that it would obscure the focus. In some ways, what's happened has proven that. You have to focus on what I have to say, Mr. Massart. Not what I've done. Well, you can see that it's not easy under these circumstances. If I could do it again, I wouldn't Obviously. But you know, what I went through is my story. Many women have been through the same thing. But Cantarax is putting millions of lives in danger. What would you have done in my shoes? -Hello. -Hello. How are you? -Good, and you? -Very good. -Would you like a table? -No, No, thank you Damien. You've heard about Mrs. Granger? Yes. Do you have any news? No, not yet. -But I think you can help me. -I'd love to, if I can. Did she come here for lunch on November 6th? Wait... Yes, she made a reservation for two. Do you remember who with? I'm sorry. She came here practically every day and was always with a different guest. -No, I'm sorry. -No, it's OK. Thanks. Is it OK if I sit for a few minutes? -No, be my guest. -Thank you. So, you say that you're sincere, and you seem sincere, but must we take your word for it? Don't you have any... -tangible proof. -Yes. Excuse me? I have copies of tests that were sent to the safety board. Tests that show clearly that Cantarax has side effects that can be fatal. And that they are quite common. About one in a thousand. And... how many people take Cantarax? Two and a half million people. One in a thousand, a hundred in a hundred thousand. You're telling us, Agnès Moreau, that Cantarax could kill more than 2,500 people? It's hypothetical, but yes. But why didn't you mention these documents earlier? Why today? I wanted to give Larcher lab the chance to do the honorable thing. To reclaim its dignity by owning up to its mistakes, and taking emergency measures. -Right... -But, now... But now, Mr. Massart, time's up. Thank you, Agnès Moreau for these revelations, -and most of all, for your sincerity. -Thank you. And now to sports. The end of the cycling season. -Do you think Mehdi knew? -I don't know. -And Diane? -Definitely. -A truce. -Of a kind, yes. You want Agnès Moreau to meet with Larcher? -Are you serious? -Very. A private meeting. Without you or me. -Is this... a trap? -A trap! Not at all. This isn't even my idea. Mr. Larcher wants to explain himself. He was affected by what Agnès Moreau said. Or what you told her to say. He wants to reclaim his honor. So? Does it bother you if I smoke? There he is. Go ahead. And, you knew how to say no to me when no one else did. It was good for me. Oh really? With you, I was reminded what it's like, a life with emotions, feelings. It's been months since I've seen those emotions. This story could do a lot of harm to both of us. People that I'm a liar and a whore. What more damage can be done? I'm sorry, I should have proposed this to you sooner. Proposed what? A million euros. -In exchange for what? -Files. Accept. Your PR team is going to move on as soon as this is over. It's their job. And you'll be left all alone. And Cantarax? We're going to start over with the tests, I promise. It was a mistake. Files, computers... grab whatever you find. DIANE GRANGER PASSWORD RESET YOUR PASSWORD Let's go... WORKERS' HOUSING GROUP -What are you doing here? -I have something for you. You want me to publish another one of your stories? You didn't understand what I said? I was fired from News 24. I can't do anything for you. I'm nothing. I don't even think I could get freelance work. Exactly. Isn't this the time to launch your site? Oh, yeah! Right. The most discredited journalist in France. It'll be a hit for sure! Please, look at it. It'll take two minutes. What is it? I'll explain. Artemis Agency, hello. Yes, hello Sandra. It's Mehdi. -Mehdi, how are you? -Fine, thank you. Could you do me a small favor? Are you still copied on Diane's work emails? Yes, of course. Would it be possible to forward me an email from Connect? Don't tell the others, but I'm working on something... I might have found a way to bring in a client Diane told me about... OK, Mehdi. I trust you. You can trust me, Sandra. Don't worry. CONNECT There you go. OK. I got it. Great. Thank you. You're welcome. How are things going with Agnès? OK, I think. I'm not included in those conversations, but... they seemed happy this morning. They're in a meeting now. Are you coming back soon? I'm not the one to ask about that, unfortunately. -Well, thanks again. -Of course. -See you soon. -See you soon, Mehdi. NEW PASSWORD COPY PASSWORD MOBILE BILL Yes! 06 63 32 21 12 CANTARAX: BREAKING AND ENTERING Agnès Moreau took the precaution of placing a camera in her apartment. Good job, Stan. Scroll down. We can identify two members of the security team of Larcher Lab. Their motive is clear: to recover the compromising documents Agnès Moreau revealed in her televised interview. It's Tessier. It has 65,000 views. -In how long? -Half an hour. In an hour, we'll be at 150,000. By tonight, a million. We'll have Le Parisien by morning, all the TV stations by the evening. -Maybe we should call Mehdi? -Definitely. Do you want to or should I? Can I do it? Of course. Go ahead. Thanks. A crazy day for the Cantarax story: following the revelations by Agnès Moreau, an investigation was opened into the risks of Cantarax and the issues with its introduction to the market. ... to withdraw it. What is this shot by Jarnac? Good evening to you too, Régis. Did you already order? What are you having? Regardless of what you think, there are rules to this. I offer you an olive branch, and you stab me in the back. No. -Tu quoque mi fili. -Oh, please! Spare me the irony, especially if it's in Latin. What are these files? Why is this coming out now? -You could have... -They don't exist. Excuse me? Agnès Moreau never had any documents. -I don't understand. -It was fake. Pseudo-scientific jargon to fool two security guards who know nothing. They're telling themselves they just missed the real ones, hidden away somewhere, but... They don't exist. A bluff. Storytelling, Régis. But, not the kind of storytelling that hides the truth from a client, no. Our kind. The kind that creates a truth that never existed. It worked because Larcher believed it enough to send in his cronies. Not bad. So you don't have anything. No proof about Cantarax. That'll never hold up in court. Of course not. But we don't care. No, what counts is that Larcher had Agnès Moreau's apartment burgled because there is something incriminating. No smoke without fire, right? That's what you taught me last time. The only truth that matters is the one people believe. I should confess something. You're the one who gave me the idea. So thank you, Régis. Thank you for saving Artemis. Don't worry. There are plenty of talented people in Paris who dream of becoming associates at Vaillant Consulting. Hey! Calm down! Hey, don't hold back! I'm not some delicate flower. Oh, OK. OK. Claire! Claire, are you OK? Should we go to dinner? I'm happy to see you. I missed you. -Are you coming to the photoshoot? -I don't know. Stan and Claire owe you a lot. You helped with the Dupuis family. No, it's all thanks to you. Good job! You were a real pro. -Tell me one thing, Agnès... -Should we eat? Can't we be seen now? Why is your phone number in Diane's call records? And the lunch on November 6th? She told me not to tell you. I promise. You have to believe me. Tell me the story, and we'll see. When I was fired. no one would listen to me. I stumbled upon an article about her, and I called the agency. She invited me to lunch, and I told her the story. She insisted that you help me, and she sent me to see Claire. With one condition. That I never tell anyone who sent me to her. If I did, she would undo it. What? Why? She said she wanted you to work together, "To set you free," that's what she said. I didn't have a choice, Mehdi. What would you have done? -Do you know where she is? -No. No. -Agnès, don't lie to me about this. -I promise I'm not. Will you tell them? The last time I said nothing, someone ended up in jail. It's a big risk. We'll see. Thanks. How are you? See, I didn't stand you up. Come on, it's OK. You know, I was here. What do you mean? Last time, I was in a taxi across the street. I was watching you. I know you're angry. It was really stupid. I ran away. -I missed you. -Me too. So, when can I meet your parents? I'm kidding! -For now! -You're an idiot! -Hello. -Thanks for being here. Mrs. Orsini, how are you? -Good, and you? -Thanks for coming. How are you? -Thanks for coming. -Thank you. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Hello. How are you? How's it going? OK, we're going to do a group photo and a portrait of Agnès for the interior. -Great. -Yeah. How many complaints have been filed thus far? -110, in two days. -Wow! Mr. and Mrs. Dupuis! Thank you for coming! We're the ones who should thank you. We thought it was our fault in the beginning. We succeeded. We did it. Oh, he's here. Where have you been? Not far. I was working on another case. Are you OK? Victory is sweet, huh? Ladies and gentlemen! Let's take our places. Are you coming? There we are. Thank you. Closer. A little closer... Mehdi, we're really happy you're here. You made sure of that. Agnès! Look over here. OK, don't move! THE CANTARAX SCANDAL No, you're joking! Come on! Campagne time! This is what we were waiting for! -Thanks. -Thanks. Sh! Sh! -What? -It's Barlier! Hello, Jacques? Yes, good evening. How are you? Yes, I see. Very good. Tomorrow, five o'clock? Perfect. Goodnight, Jacques. See you tomorrow. -Barlier's coming back. -I told you! Yes! Agnès! What's with that face? You won! -We won. -Yeah, we won! Congratulations... You OK? I have to tell you something. What is it? -Excuse me. -But... Mehdi! -What do we do? -We open the champagne. -Shouldn't we wait? -No, come on. Open it. Let's open it! DIANE GRANGER BRAVE, I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT. IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO RUIN THE PARTY. I'M COUNTING ON YOU, MEHDI. DIANE Mehdi! -Here! -Here he is! -Ah! -Here. -We didn't do so bad, huh. -Not bad at all. -So, what did you want to tell us? -What I wanted to tell you? To Diane. -To Diane! -To Diane!
