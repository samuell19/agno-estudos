FEATHERED Come in. Are you hungry? I don't know if Mom put some money aside. Sure you're not hungry? Damn. Ben. Hey, Ben! I'm talking to you. Shit. Go take the picture. I see you have a new sidekick. - What do you care? - I'm only asking. That's all. I'm not used to seeing you with someone. Weirdos like him can work in parties. It's harmless. Nothing to worry about. Not interested. Think about it, Sam. Your scams won't take you far. Your friend won't be of much help. - Get lost. - Okay. Okay. I'll leave you with your coins, alright? And also, if you're ever in trouble, Sam... Call me. Hey. How are you? Leave him alone. - What's your name? - Don't touch him. It's okay. Relax. I'm not going to hurt your friend. Come back. Hi, CÃ©dric. What's up? Alright? Could you lend me some money? I can't help you, Sam. It's not my fault if you're in deep shit. Now get lost. Come on! Go ahead. Next fight in 10 minutes. Keep it up, Ben. See? It wasn't that bad. Same bet? - Just one more. - No. We're out of here. Okay. Just one. We'll leave afterwards. I'm doing this for us. Do you understand? Carmel, he has to take off his clothes, too. Okay. Your brother has to be in his boxers. What? - He has to be in his boxers. - Why? Because they both have to. Come on. Take this. No. Fight! See? I told you. Okay, stop now. That's enough. Remember when we were in Spain with Mom? You used to talk more. Isn't it, Ben? You would imitate the passers-by. You would scream after them. Remember? You were so annoying. You embarrassed me. You used to sing, too. Remember? You loved the horrors mom listened to. Our neighbors hated us. Subtitles: Eclair Media
