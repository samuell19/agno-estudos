[TOY PIANO PLAYING] [CHUCKLES] Hey, kiddo. Okay. What are you playing? It's Okay If You Fly Away, Butterfly. - Did you write that? - Mm-hmm. - I love it. - It's right here. Oh, it's right there. Those are the notes? - What's that? - It's for you. - "Thug Life." - Thug life. - You made this at school? - Yes. [CLICKS TONGUE] Did your Uncle Tyler tell you that? - Yes. - Of course, he did. And I'm sure I'm going to hear about that. Did you like the movie? - Well, I have a question. - Okay, what's your question? Doesn't live action mean, like, live actors? - Mm-hmm. - Then, I was thinking why do they call the new Lion King movie live-action... when it's all CGI animals and no people? Uh... Because the people in charge of that are... not as smart as you. Uh, and neither am I. - Okay. Go to bed. - I am in bed. Go to sleep. You can't just tell somebody to go to sleep and just expect them to close their eyes and go to sleep. I have a lot on my mind, dude. - Your mother and I ever tell you you're adopted? - Hilarious. Mm. Go to sleep. - But... - Go... to... sleep! - I will if you do the line. - [SIGHS] - "Okay, what's in the box?" - [GIGGLES] Quit it. Okay, do not tell your mom I let you watch that, okay? - Yes. - Good. Okay. Lights out. [EXCLAIMS] Yeah, yeah. I'm going to get this off. Okay, Mia. Goodnight, butterfly. [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] Got to go back there and look again! I know what I saw! We searched his entire place. We didn't find anything. And by the way, he was very cooperative. He let us do all of that without a warrant. Besides, you said it yourself, you saw it for a second from a distance - at night. - No! Do not do that! I am not crazy. - I know what I fucking saw! - Okay! Okay, here's what I need you to do for me. I need you to calm down, okay? I didn't say you were crazy. You just lost your daughter, and you needing someone to blame is completely understandable, but accusing someone of murder requires evidence. - I understand what you're going through. - [RYAN SCOFFS] And I know that you're trying to deal with this all in your own way, but finding your daughter's killer is my job, and this grief counselor... is really good at hers. [JESSIE SOBBING] [RYAN SIGHS] Look, she's wrong. It's him. I know it. It doesn't matter! It won't bring her back. She's gone. Our baby's gone, and you can't fix it. You can't fix anything. You can't bring her back to me. You can't. - [JESSIE WAILING] - All right. [SHUSHES] All right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Jess? Jess? Jess? [MAN OVER VOICEMAIL] Hey, Ryan. It's Frank. I just... Everyone in the office, we're all thinking about you... and Jessie. [SIGHS] [SIGHS DEEPLY] Hell, I don't really know what I'm going do with this place. Hell, nobody even touched it since all that shit went down with the press it got. How many women is it up to now? What, 50? - Fifty-three. - Jesus. Yeah, some people. After you. Don't mind the smell. [SIGHS] Well, you wanted to see it, and here it is. Yeah. Speedy, the custodian, he lived down here for 15 years. He didn't really have much. Didn't really want much, either. He, uh, took two to the chest trying to stop that robbery over at the Sip and Slip last month. Yeah. I guess that's the... risk you take for trying to be a hero, huh? The, uh, sink and toilet, shower, they all work, - but I like I said... - No one comes down here? The building, I mean? Not even on a dare. Listen, uh... Look, I don't know what your deal is, but if you're... planning on doing anything illegal here... It's nothing like that. Well, then, what is it? I mean, we drove here in your car... you talk like you got a degree on the wall at home, so I mean, I ain't no scab-picker. I definitely ain't one to turn down free money, but, uh... Look, I'm not going to do anything illegal. I'm not going to cause you any problems. - [CASH BILLS RUFFLE] - Is this enough for a month? "Split all ends up, and they shall not crack." "And death shall have no dominion." Yeah. [DOOR CREAKS] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] [SIGHS] [TYLER OVER VIDEO] Come on! Come on, gorilla! Mia Manila! Come on! Come on! [TYLER GRUNTING] - MIA: Get up. Get up! - [TYLER CHUCKLES] What the hell are you doing? - TYLER: It was Ryan's idea. - RYAN: What? - Not me. It was not me. - [JESSIE LAUGHS] ...behind that jab, double it up, triple it up. Wait for him to drop his hands. [BEEPS] MAN: Work the jab. Work the jab. You had the slip. Move. Move! Circle. [APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS] - Hey. - TYLER: Hey. - You hungry? - Yeah. [SNIFFLES] [CLEARS THROAT] TYLER: So, you and Jess... Jess is fine. She's... you know, at her sisters. Um... How's... How's, uh, Charkhian looking? You know, you had a shot there. - I had a shot at doing what... - Ty. You know, I mean, if I hadn't done five... Yeah, I get it. Why don't you go down to the store, get some salt... - Jesus Christ. Relax. - ...rub it in my fucking eye. - You fucking relax. I'm completely relaxed. - I am relaxed. - Why don't you stop losing hair? - It's a little late for that. [BOTH CHUCKLE] So, um... - So, the house... - House is... fine. I just, uh... I couldn't do what I needed to do there. And what the fuck's that supposed to mean? Have a seat. Take a look. What the fuck am I looking at? That's the guy who killed Mia. I need you to get me a gun, Ty. Here you go. [SIGHS, SNIFFLES] So tell me, what's the plan? I get you a gun, and you just go over there and cap this motherfucker like Sam Jackson? Well, I'll get him to admit it first, but after that, um... yeah. Pretty much after that. Pretty much after that. So you're just fucking Keyser Soze here? You ever been to prison, dumbass? Because I have, and this, by the way, real good training camp for the fucking Hoosegow. As far as getting the truth out of him... I'd really like to fuck Taylor Swift. Look, he killed Mia! He took her, and he killed her and... and now he just gets to live his creepy-ass... No. No! He... I know it, and I need this to end, and I need to end him. Look, are you gonna help me or not? [SIGHS] [SNIFFLES] Give me a minute, man. I need a minute, okay? [TYLER SIGHS] I'm gonna call an Uber. I'm gonna call an Uber. [CICADAS CHIRPING] [SIGHS] I need to hear you say it one more time. You're sure this guy is the guy? I'm positive. [SIGHS DEEPLY] Fuck me. All right, man. Well, if you're going to do this... the most you ever want him to be is a missing person... which means you're gonna have to make it look like he took a trip... plant a receipt. I don't know. Train ticket, something. - As for the body... - I got a plan for that. I'm thinking the lake or the woods, but I'm leaning towards the woods. - A boat? - Exactly. And in the woods, I got more cover, so... Well, that makes it easy then, doesn't it? [RYAN SIGHS] TYLER: Besides, there's one thing that's more important than any of that shit, man. You have to go into this cold, not hot. There's not going to be a minute to second guess yourself, so, do you think you have it in you to not do that? Yeah. [SIGHS] All right, man. I'll get you a gun... but I'm also going to help you do it. No. No, Ty. I can't ask you to do that. Fuck you! Fuck you, all right? Mia was my goddaughter, so that's the deal. Take it or leave it. Look, man. I know it doesn't feel like it now, but... [SIGHS] you could actually still have... a life after this. but only if you do it right, which means you are going to need help. Hell, man, I would too. All right, then. Let's get to it. It's clean. You sure this guy's home? He is... This guy's been my... He closed all his blinds a few days ago for some reason, but he hasn't broken his routine. Same rooms light up at the same times. All right, then. Just like we planned, right? [CLATTERING] [CLATTERING CONTINUES] [WOOD CREAKING] [CLATTERING CONTINUES] He's out. [GRUNTING] Let's just put him down. Didn't what's-his-face used to live here? Huh? I don't know. Let's just... Could we just get this done? Come on. - Okay, here we go. Okay. - Wait, wait, wait. All right. [GRUNTING] - Oh! Oh! - TYLER: Oh, crap! RYAN: Are you okay? - Up... means... - I heard you. - Come on. Are you okay? - ...direction. Yes. RYAN: Just stand up. - One, two, three. Up! - Fuck! - One, two, three, up! - Yeah. [GRUNTS] In the seat. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Fuck. Okay. Can you get the stuff? RYAN: Fuck it. Remember me, Mr. Granger? You're... You're Ryan Olsen, - the father of... - Mia. The girl you murdered. No, I did not. Don't lie to me! (SIGHS) I'm not calling the cops this time. It's just you and me. I've been watching you, asshole. I know what you are, and I know what I saw. You sitting at your kitchen table, holding my daughter's favorite butterfly hairclip in your creepy-ass hands. Are you gonna tell me I didn't? Yes. I mean, no. I said... Look, look, I let the police search my house. They didn't even have a warrant, but I let them, and they didn't find it because I never had it. Please... You're welcome to search... Search my house. I could never do that to a child. I couldn't. I wouldn't. Please. You have to believe me. I'm sorry, Stan, but I don't. [CELLPHONE RINGING] Hammett. Yeah, okay. I'm on my way. - [GRUNTS] - You want me to stop? Yes. Then tell me! [GRUNTS] Tell me what I want to know! Tell me! [GRUNTS] Aw, fuck! Just tell me and I'll stop. I promise! I didn't. RYAN: Ow, fuck. TYLER: Ryan, come on. He ain't goin' anywhere. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [SIGHS] [GRUNTS] It ain't broke, man. You just gotta ice it. He's gonna break. I know it. I don't know, man. No, look, all we have to do is go down there and, like, what do you mean, you don't know? What, you mean, you don't know - or you mean you don't know? - No, no, I just... I just mean... [SIGHS] I don't know if you're gonna get to bang Taylor before we... You know... [SIGHS] Show me. All right, get forensics out here. K-9 units, too. And seal off the road. No one comes in or out. [PHONE RINGING] Yeah, what do you got? I need the past 72 hours of traffic-cam footage for the two streets that go in and out of the old Chalmers backroad. There's no traffic-cams on Chalmers, but there are on the other two and we might catch a break there. Yeah. I'll be here until forensics is done bagging everything. Explain a few things to me, Stan. What would a single man with no kids be buying boxes of children's vitamins and stuffed animals for? Are you going to kill me? Depends on your answers. Okay. - My niece. - Your niece? My niece, she just turned three, and I sent the toys to her for her birthday. And the vitamins, are you gonna tell me you sent those to her for her birthday too? No. What? What, Stan? It's... It's em... it's embarrassing. I take them. I prefer them over the adult. Okay. [SIGHS] Explain this, asshole. Bonding with Captors? Are you gonna tell me you're reading that for some fucking book club? Hey! [CRYING] This is a mistake. In case you missed it, this is your one chance to save yourself, so stop fucking crying and start talking! But you've already made up your mind or you wouldn't be doing this. Start talking! Talk now! - Oh, God! - Or so help me God, I will pull this fucking trigger! - Talk! - It happened to me! What? What happened to you? It happened to me! It happened. TYLER: Hey! I didn't do this, so help me God. I never touched your daughter. You have the wrong man. Tell me what happened to you. All right. I don't know. Maybe Detective Hammett was right. Maybe... Maybe, I didn't see it. If you say you saw it, then I know you did. Come on, you're not actually starting to believe him, - are you? - [SIGHS] I don't know. You? Me? It doesn't fuckin' matter. You know what the minimum sentence for kidnapping is? It's 20 fucking years. We still gotta go to the woods, we still gotta dig the hole before the sun's up. Look, I just... I have to be sure. You are. "I'm positive." That's what you said. How the fuck are you gonna be more sure than you already were I'm gonna find it. Hey, any mess you make, we gotta... Ah, fuck off. You're going to die tonight, Stan. Only question is quick or slow? See, I can't talk Ryan down, but if you come clean about what you did, I can promise it'll be quick. It's Ty, right? Tyler. We ain't fuckin' friends, asshole. May I ask if you believe in God? Do I look like a fuckin' Christian to you? You know what Gandhi said about Christians? Do I look like I fuckin' care? He said, "I like your Christ. I do not like your Christians. "Your Christians are so unlike your Christ." No. I do not mean a belief derived from an institution built by men seeking only to serve their own selfish interests, But a true belief, which I have. And I swear to you by that belief, I had nothing to do with what happened to Ryan's daughter, Tyler. Ooh! [SCREAMING] What the fuck are you doing, man? You want a fucking confession, right? What d... Stop! Just get it the fuck out! [GROANING] What the fuck are you doing, man? Let's just get this over with. I... okay, I'm not ready. [SIGHS] [DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE] [GRUNTS] Mr. Granger? Detective Hammett! [GRUNTS] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] I just wanna talk. [MOUTHING] [GRUNTS] [SIGHS] - Hey, you good? - Yeah. I put him down the second I heard it, man. I... What the fuck? - You think she knows? - No. No, she woulda kicked in the door if she did. She was here for him. That was, uh... the lead detective on Mia's case. What if she finally has something on him? Do I really got to explain to you how fucking stupid this is? I gotta know. So we do it, and then you call her and find out. No. No, 'cause if this has anything to do with Mia's case... - God damn it, man. - This is exactly what I... You always second-guess yourself. Shut up! It's my daughter! It's my fucking daughter! We have plenty of time. [CELLPHONE RINGING] Hammett. Uh, Detective. Hi, it's... it's Ryan... Olsen. Hi, Mr. Olsen. It's pretty late. Yeah, no... I know. I'm sorry about the hour. I just... I really needed to talk to you. Sure. Listen, I know it's been a while, but I want you to know we're still doing everything we can on your daughter's case. Yeah. Is there, um... Is there anything new, uh, that I should know about? Well, it's an open investigation, so unfortunately, as much as I'd like to, there are certain things I really can't get into. Right. Right. Um, well... The reason I called is, um, I... I actually have some information about, uh, Stan Granger that I... I thought, uh, you might want to know about. I really hope you haven't been doing anything stupid, Mr. Olsen. Yeah. That makes two of us. Okay, listen, I'm actually in your neighborhood right now, so maybe it'd be better if we talk in person. How about I stop by in, say, ten minutes? Okay. Fuck. Ow! Some fuckin' bullshit! Look, I have to know. At least leave me the gun, dumbass. Shit. Take it. Thank you. [SIGHS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Detective. Mr. Olsen. How are you holding up? [MUMBLES] And your wife? Uh, she's... She's okay. Uh, fine. Actually, she's staying at her sister's for a... for a little bit. So... I don't suppose you ever called that number I gave you? It's on my list of things to do. Well, for what it's worth, I've... I've known a few people who have been where you are, and they all say that talking to someone helps. with a lot of things. Food for thought. Anyway, you said you had some information for me about Stan Granger. Could you at least tell me if there have been any developments in Mia's case? I'm still doing everything that I can, and, but nothing new has come up. And I'm sorry, I know that's not what you want to hear, but you'll be the first to know, I promise, once I have something. And, uh, Stan Granger, has he been completely eliminated as a... a... a suspect? That's not really how it works. We go where the evidence takes us, and there simply is no evidence implicating Granger. Now, you said you had something. Um... Here. Look, I know how this looks, and I know that none of it may actually be evidence, uh, but you have to admit that... What? You said he closed all of his blinds three days ago? Mm-hmm. Okay. Look, Stan Granger did actually just pop up on my radar again very recently. Now it's for a different case, and an open investigation, so I can't get into the details. And as a police officer, I can't say I approve of what you've been doing, so I certainly couldn't ask you to take part in an official investigation, even if you are practically neighbors with him and might be in a position to take a look at his van and relay back whether or not it's been freshly painted, which is information that might be of interest to certain parties. Mm-hmm. [SIGHS] Okay, uh, thanks again for meeting me. I didn't. It's been three days since Clara Bloom was last seen by her family. The five-year-old was believed to have been on Chalmers Road near the Como Zoo with classmates on a field trip before she disappeared. The police are asking anyone with leads to call the number on the screen. ANCHORMAN: Thanks, Francine. Once again, for those of you just joining us, Salisbury... Shit. - You think he painted it? - I do. I remember you looking at this guy for the Olsen girl. The father stated that he saw Granger in possession of a hair clip that belonged to the vic. Granger let us conduct a search on his property voluntarily, but we came up empty, and, I mean, beyond the father's insistence that he was guilty, we really didn't have a reason to like him for it, at the time. You still don't, for either. Right now, all you've got is a similar van turning down the street. Around the approximate time Clara Bloom went missing. But we don't know that she was even taken in a van. It takes three minutes to drive down Chalmers from end to end, and there's absolutely nothing on it. It's just a backroad on the edge of the zoo's perimeter. This van turns onto Chalmers at 11:47. It doesn't exit onto Park until 12:31, which means it was on Chalmers for 44 minutes. 44 minutes. It's not that hard to paint a van. Okay. Okay? - Okay, what? - Okay, bring me something else. But I don't need to remind you that we're coming up on three days gone, so do it fast. Okay. What are you gonna do if he doesn't come back? [CELLPHONE VIBRATING] Well? Here. It's been three days since Clara Bloom was last seen by her family. The five-year-old was believed to have been on Chalmers Road near the Como Zoo with classmates on a field trip before she... So she wasn't here about Mia, she was here about... Clara. - What'd she tell you? - Not much, just to... [SIGHS] [WATER FAUCET RUNNING] Clara Bloom disappeared the same night Stan closed all his blinds. TYLER: This is it? - Good. - Good? No, I don't mean "good." I mean, now we can fucking kill him, right? - No. - Fuck you mean, no? They haven't found a body. The police are still looking. Okay. That don't mean she's still alive. That is not a risk I'm willing to take. Look, I get it, all right? But the truth is, we don't know shit. We don't know this guy's M.O. I mean, did she even tell you for sure what the fucking van's all about? No, she just said she needed to know if the van had been painted and, you know, I've got to let her... It's been painted, and I've got to let her know. And it has, and I am going to tell her. What the fuck are you doing? [TEXT WHOOSH] Did you just... Motherfucker! That text will send the fucking cops through that door any fucking minute! Yeah. Which is why you should go, Ty. Look, we're way off-book, and there is no reason you should go down for this with me. Can you please just go, okay? Please. Put your fucking shit on, dumbass. - Where is she, huh? - Where is who? The missing girl, fucker! I don't know what you're talking about. Uh-uh. See that dog ain't going to hunt no more. We know you painted your van. We know you closed all your blinds the same day she went missing. Vitamins, stuffed animals, the fact that that detective just knocked on your door, not to mention what Ryan said he saw you holding. You add all that up... No. No. Tyler, I can't speak to what Ryan saw in his grief, nor would I presume to. Now I did paint my van. I do it once a year to prevent rust. The weather is very harsh here. Doing it myself saves me from being gouged by a professional. As for the rest, all I can say is what I've already said. I had nothing, nothing to do with what happened to Mia, just like I had nothing to do with what happened to the girl, the other girl. Buying any of it? Help me get his shoes off then. Why? Why? What are you doing? You don't have to do this. Last chance, fucker. Please, don't do this. I can't tell you what I don't know. I don't know how many different ways I can say that. - You're full of shit, buddy. - No. No! [SCREAMING] [GRUNTING] [RECORD PLAYER SKIPPING] You ready to talk? Huh? The girl, fucker! Where? - I believe in God... - Talk! Talk! - ...the Father Almighty, the creator... - Fuck you! - ...of Heaven, the gift of life... - Fuck you! - ...and Jesus Christ, His only Son... - Fuck you, you Bible-thumping... ...piece of shit! - ...and is seated at the right hand... - Fuck you... - ...you fucking piece of shit! - of the Father, the man who... - I'll fucking take your teeth out... - ...and was crucified under... - ...one at a time! - ...Pontius Pilate. - He was crucified and died... - You fucking piece of shit! Go. [VOMITING] I meant what I said earlier, you should just go, Ty. Fuck you. - Ty. - Get the fuck off me! Look, Ty, you're the toughest son of a bitch I know, but, maybe it's like your mom used to say, maybe our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. We can't fucking break him, and we can't fucking kill him. Where does that leave us, huh? What, we just sit here and wait for the cops to come and cuff us? [GRUNTS] Clara's the priority now. They got dogs and forensics, and resources we don't have. If you think I'm going to leave you holding the bag on this yourself, man... I'm sorry. I'm sorry I dragged you into this shit. It ain't on you, man. I dragged myself into this shit, remember? Look, I just... Look, I just, you know, needed to hear him say it more than I needed... I know. I don't know what I needed, man. I just knew that Mia was... You were Uncle Ty. [CRYING] Right. So let's see if Uncle Ty's got this straight. We know it's him. Well, you ain't going to get no closure. We've got no real proof. That other girl might be alive out there somewhere still, and, uh, our only option is, what, just to sit here and wait to see how long our prison sentence is going to be? That about sum it up? [CHUCKLING] [SNORTS] [SIGHS] No! RYAN: No! No! Gosh! [RYAN SOBBING] It's okay. [DOOR OPENS] She's still alive, isn't she? Fuck you! Fuck you, God damn it! Hey! Hey! [COUGHING] STAN: Ryan. Ryan. Don't take it personal. It's just what the good Lord wants. See, we are God's entertainment, his own personal reality TV show, so we need to keep things interesting for Him. It's his mandate. Not mine. [CHUCKLES] Believe me. None of this is my idea. It's just how He made me. And in the end, all any of us can do is our best to serve His purposes. Is she alive, man? Just fucking tell us. - Fuck. - No! No! I know. I know. I know. Just don't fall apart on me, all right? Please. We got to hold it together, man. We got to hold it together, okay? - We have to call 911. - I know. Look, man. Hey, hey. - We got him. - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. This was all you, man. This was all you, okay? So if they do find that other girl alive out there somewhere, [SOFT] who knows? - Maybe the judge will go easy on us. - Yeah. Wait, where are you going? What are you doing? I'm going to go take the plastic down from the walls. I think it might look better when the cops come, if it doesn't look like we had a fucking execution planned. Oh, shit. Okay. All right. - I'll take you to her. - What? Clara. I'll take you to her. [PANTING] What now? I'll take you to her, but only you two. Asshole, it's fucking over. The cops... They'll never find her, and if you bring them into this now... I promise, neither will you. If you fucking think for one second that we... I want this to be over. The truth is, I'm tired. I knew this day was going to come, and when I woke up in this chair with you two standing over me, I knew that day was today. But if meeting my end means going to prison, then I'm sure He would rather I let Clara die from dehydration, before I tell anyone where she is. Call it a piece de resistance. As for me, the thought of spending years on death row, while some small-minded shrinks prod me with questionnaires, like squirrels, trying to make sense of computer code, the thought of that is a little more than I can bear. But I have no illusions. I know what I've done, and I know what has to happen. It's just simply a matter of a quick or a slow death, and Tyler, earlier, you offered me a choice between the two. So, if I still have a say, I'd like to be the one to make that choice. Did my daughter have a choice, asshole? I'm offering you Clara Bloom's life for the promise of a quick death. Do we have a deal? [TYLER GROANS] That asshole's done nothing but fuck with us from the start! Yeah, hold on, hold on, hold on a second. Let's just take a second. Let's just take a step back and think about this. Okay, okay. I mean, even if he is 99 percent full of shit, do we at least buy that he is never going to tell anyone where Clara is if we bring the cops in? Because if that's true, then maybe they don't have a better shot now at saving her than we do. Maybe calling them actually makes things worse for Clara. You know the second we smell bullshit, we turn you over to the cops with all your little-ass trophies. You know that, right? Yeah. All right. - Where are we going, Stan? - It's not far. So tell me, honestly, how did I do? Emotions are so tricky. But I've had a lot of practice, and I really feel I hit all the right notes at the right moments tonight. Clara would've been my sixth. I've killed five children across three states for Him, and I'm sure the parents all probably felt similar things, to what you experienced, Ryan, but the truth is, the world never stops spinning, the universe didn't even blink. That's because good and evil, they don't really exist. They're human concepts. Like the offspring of wild animals are killed and die all the time. But when it happens to people, they make a big deal out of it, and that's because I think that we are fundamentally these self-important beings and the irony is, [CHUCKLES] there are some serious problems facing our species. I don't think anyone has an idea. I don't think people understand how close we are to our own extinction event. The world had four billion people in it when I was born. Now there are eight, eight billion people. So, in another 100 years, overpopulation will ensure that our planet can no longer sustain human life. Other species will survive and thrive, of course. But we will not. And here you are, focusing all your attention on the life, of one small child. Why? Because our brains were not designed to handle problems that big. [POPS LIPS] So, instead, we focus on the small. And that, that is our fatal flaw. The bug that He wrote into our programming, to make sure that we remain a flash-in-the-pan sitcom that in the grand scheme of things., in the grand scheme of the planet's life, will not have even aired enough episodes to make it into syndication. It's sad. Sorry, should we be taking notes? I bet you're pretty popular with the ladies, aren't you, Tyler? Which kind of proves my whole point about us being doomed as a species. I cannot wait to fucking kill you. You certainly have that look. I remember what it was like for me my first time. Surprising, though, how much the conception, differs from the execution. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [DOOR CREAKING] [STAN GRUNTING] What is this place? It's a property I own anonymously. You'll find Clara upstairs. After you, Stan. [GROANS] TYLER: Stop. There's no one here. TYLER: Uh-huh. Go on, then. Aren't there any fucking lights? There are in the bedroom. That's where Clara is. Just take it nice and slow, Stan. That's the only option I have, Tyler. Relax. You're the one with the gun. Besides, even if my leg were healthy and my hands weren't tied... I still get the sense that I'd be no match for you physically, so why so worried? Gentlemen... why are we really here? Did you agree to this deal because you truly want to save Clara? Or is it simply because you want to save yourself the consequences... of getting revenge for Mia? That would make the most sense since self-preservation... that's every being's prime directive. She's the only reason you ain't in the fucking ground already. But keep talking... and I'll happily pop a cap up your ass right now. Forgive me. Human nature interests me and I was always trying to learn. I'm going to turn the lights on. Please don't shoot me yet, Tyler. [BOTH GRUNTING] [SCREAMS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [THUDDING ON DOOR] [GROANS] [THUDDING CONTINUES] [DOOR BREAKING] Ahh! MIA: Get up. Get up!

Fucking Newgrove. Kevin Newgrove. Kevin-fucking-Newgrove! That's who used to live... That's who used to live there. His sister! I fucked his sister in the basement bathroom! - Where's the bathroom? - What? Where's the... Take us back. - Take us back! Take us back! - Jesus fucking Christ. Jesus, God damn it, Ty! I'm fine. Clara. Fuck. It was right there! [GRUNTS] This is sound-proofing foam. Get a hammer! Get something. Move! Move! Move! She's in there. She's in there. Come on. TYLER: Go. RYAN: I'm here. Daddy. Gentlemen... we owe you a debt of gratitude. Detective Hammett here has been telling me how you guys basically, um... Uh, Lieutenant, it's been a long night. Everything will be in my report, and we can bring these guys back later to give their official statements... but for now, I... I'm sure Mr. Olsen and Mr. Long would appreciate it if we, uh... you know... Sure. We can wait till tomorrow for you to give your statement. God knows we've got enough to keep us busy. Mr. Olsen, Mr. Long, would you like to come with me? - Uh-huh. - Yes. Yes, we would. Hammett, hospital. As soon as I get these guys squared away. You two should go to the hospital, too. Mr. Olsen, I will call you later tonight and tell you exactly what I want you to say to my lieutenant... when you two give your statements, all right? Uh... Yeah. Okay. And guys, stay away from the press. Sure. Jessie. Ryan. I'm gonna call an Uber. - You're coming with us, Ty. - Okay.
