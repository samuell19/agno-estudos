We must give children foods rich in vitamins, protein, calcium, and iron. And, we must give children fruit to eat. Because fruit is rich in nutrients, and very beneficial to childrens' bodies. We also should pay attention to giving warm and comfortable clothes for our children to wear. We must also teach them to cherish hygiene and maintain cleanliness and beauty. We must also remember to give them books to study to increase their knowledge and develop their courage so they become modern citizens. Ladies and Gentlemen, we must all act together. Dear little friends, today is your holiday. You should be happy, and should go forward as a united and flourishing army. Celebrate Children's Day! Children are the future leaders of the nation. Come, come! We must cherish children, respect children. Da dee dee da dee... Hello... Hello! Damn, little pickpocket, I'll take you to the police. Are you blind? Do you still dare or not?

Hello, friend.. A little thief just ran by. Did you see him? - No, I didn't. I saw him run over here! I haven't seen him! I'm selling children. Anyone want a child? I'm selling children. We really can't afford to raise these children. As long as Madame is looking if you can get them a bowl of rice to eat, that's enough. These children are unsuitable. Oh... this child... - No, no... He has no parents! Hey! Child, do you have parents? - No. Why are you for sale? I'm hungry. I must eat. Eat? That's easy! What are you doing for sale? Come with me. But, you'll have to obey an adult. - Really? It's impossible I don't have a child! You think that wild child is yours, don't dream of it! She gave birth to a wild child, and you? You also gave birth to one. Go and look! Who can't beget children, you or me? You have the nerve to talk about it! I'm telling you that we can talk until dawn. Don't imagine you can bring that evil woman here. Get out! That child, Three Hairs, is here. Ok. Ask him to come in. Madame. The child is here. This child's family is pure? I've enquired about him. He's from a very good family. Is he intelligent? - Extremely intelligent. Is he obedient? He knows to obey adults, heh, heh... Come here! Good. From now on, call me Mommy, ok? What? What? What are you doing with this child? What am I doing? He's my son! Oh! This is your chairman of the board, meaning my elder brother. From now on, your name isn't Three Hairs. It's Tommy. Tom My? No. Obey adults, ok? Oh! Tommy, this is the right thing! Ok! Have some pastry! Eat! Hey! Use a fork! Don't make a sound! This way. Miss Wu This Saturday, I'd like to have a party for this child.

This is Aunt Sun. Ha, ha... this child is really intelligent. Intelligent and unaffected. He truly is noble and dignified. Good and clever, more than you. Hey!
