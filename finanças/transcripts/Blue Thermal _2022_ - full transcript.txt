For someone from our family to go to university... But why did you have to choose one all the way in Tokyo? This month you're only moving. Understand? Oh, don't say that! I'm really thankful, mum. Well, don't overdo it! NAGASAKI AIRPORT NAGASAKI AIRPORT Living alone in Tokyo can be dangerous. Suspicious people, scammers, and so on. Make sure to be careful! You're worrying too much! Well, mum, you're going to be alone now, right? Oh, you don't have to worry about that! I have friends at home after all. Departure 12:10. Passengers of flight ANA2438 to Haneda: There, you need to go. Right! Please head towards the gate. Then, I'll be going. Ah, Tamaki! Jeez, what are you doing... Ma'am, are you alright? Karate Club Aonagi University Soft Tennis Club Tsuru Tamaki, finally at the university of her dreams! First off, romance! I wanna fall in love... like in the movies! You're next, bob-cut girl over there! Okaaay! University life is all about the clubs, of course! Boys and girls can meet as much as they want here! Here it comes! Oh, you're good! Nice one! Nice receive! Oh, bob-cut girl! Ouch! Hey, Sorachi! What are you gonna do about this wing? I'm sorry. Well, well, it wasn't on purpose, right? Hey, there's nothing glue can't fix! You gotta pay for this! Eeh! Sh-she just came to try out... I have nothing to do with this! Well then... Ah, wait! What was that at the end? So, uh... How much do you think it would cost to fix? This thing you broke... It was made in Germany and costs 15 million! Even just the wing would cost several million yen. That's roughly the amount you would have to come up with. Hold on! It's over... My bright university life is over... Here! Do your best! Tsuru's in the volleyball club! Don't make me laugh! That little girl?! Yeah, it's ridiculous! She's so loud for being in a sports club! It's too embarrassing, I could never do that! Ah, Ooi is also pretty enthusiastic about sports, right? He even said “do your best”. Like I said before. It's all about you; I do not care if you are there or not. So like I said, I do not need you. Eh– Dad– Where... Like I said, she didn't do anything! Oh, good, you woke up! Uh, yes... Sorry that you were startled by this guy. No, I should be saying that. I'm Kuramochi, the guy in charge of this club. This is Sorachi Daisuke, year 2. I'm Tsuru Tamaki, first year in literature. Uh, where... is this? This is the Aonagi University athletics association aviation club. Athletics- Aviation club. We ride gliders. Ah, those guys who fly over Lake Biwa! Those are birdmen! We don't make our own planes, we use real ones. Look! You've seen one of these, right? Ah! Oh, that's one of our leaflets! What did you do with it?! Eh? I found it like this somewhere on campus. I thought it was a publicity stunt for airplanes or something. We don't do such publicity stunts! Heh, good one. I like you. Why not join our club? Huh? Eh? We have a regular try-out meeting. For now, just have a look. K-Kuramochi-san! She– is that really okay? It was her fault that our glider broke! Hmm, but... You say that, but the one who hit the wing was you, right? Uh– that's... Well, this is how it is. The place is written on there. Um, but... Make sure to be there! Ah, hi, mum? Tama! Why at this time? So, uh, well... There's something I have to talk about. What is it? So actually it's, uh, I need money. You're asking already?! No, that's not how it is! So what is it? No, well, it is about money. Well, there you go! You should be able to get a job on a weekly basis, like an adult! Huh?! That has nothing to do with it! By sending you to university, I'm just barely making ends meet here all the same! In the first place, you're– Mum Mum Mum Mum Mum Mum I ended up coming. But still... There's nothing but onion plants here... Is there really going to be a plane? That guy... AONAGI UNIVERSITY ATHLETICS ASSOCIATION AVIATION CLUB It went up! As you would expect from Kuramochi-san! Oh– Hey! The chore girl shouldn't be late! C-chore girl? What's this? There's a room over there. Get changed. Eh? Just so you know, this is not a general activity club where we just play around! Frankly, when someone like you comes it's nothing but a nuisance! Huh?! You were the ones who made me come here! If you don't like it, go home now! Otherwise, you'll have to work here all day! Hey– wait! Ah, what's with him?! This is so annoying! Damn it! If you're gonna be like that, don't complain if I'm stubborn as well! Senpai! Here, I changed. What am I supposed to do now? Go on and tell me already! New member! Well done! No time to relax, get the seat cushions next! Why don't you do it? Damn it, why do I have to... You're late, chore girl! Don't slack off! Tsuru Tamako? Yeah! For the next flight, you ride with me. Eh? Ride with you? Kuramochi-san? You want to fly with her?! That's right. After all, she's also a candidate member. Get the ballast for Tsurutama, would you? Hey! How much do you weigh? Huh? Why would I have to tell you something like that?! We put weights in the seats so the glider is properly balanced. How many kilograms is it? Spit it out already! Fo-forty– And don't lie! If you fudge the numbers, you will fall! Fifty kilos, exactly. Really? Huh? Why would you say something like that?! Just so you know, I haven't even flown with him myself yet, but if I put a little fatty like you on the plane and something bad happens... I'll never ever forgive you! L-little fatty? How dare you? A dumb midget like you shouldn't be telling me that! Shut up, fatty! Midget! Go to hell! Front seat ballast harness in place. Don't throw up! Throw up...? Check! Small ring, black fuse! Release open! Open. Close! Closed. Fat– ty? Huh?! This guy– Alright, Tsuru Tamako? Eh? Right now, this glider is connected to a winch by a wire rope. A winch? This rope being wound in at 100 kilometers per hour is what generates lift. Don't touch the controls. Keep your eyes open and look forwards. Menuma winch, this is two-seater Aonagi 21. Riverside cable prepared. Two-seater Aonagi 21, cable fully prepared. What? What was that sound?! Aonagi 21, separation confirmed. I didn't do anything! Ah, no, we just detached. Aonagi 21, separation altitude 580. 580, roger. Let's go below that cloud. Eh? There are rising currents below clouds of this type. Huh... Eh, wait– what was that just now?! The left side was like “aaah”– Left? This is bad! We're gonna fall! We're not going to fall. A strong positive current on the left, huh... Blue thermal? Blue– what's that? Huh? Ah, a windstream that will make us happy if we catch it. Huh? Let's go! Wow... Kuramochi-san is doing a Lazy Eight? What is he doing, going all out with the new member try-outs... But even then, he's going in forward... is he trying to haze her? I'll go get the barf bag... Sorachi! Uh– Why does she get to ride with him... What's up, Sorachi? Ah... he's upset that Kuramochi-san took her with him... Urgh... Huh? Nice landing! Aonagi 21, shoulder! Ah... what is this... Amakumo, from the south! Disassemble like this! What's up, Tsurutama? Were you scared? Yes! That's not it! The sky was so close, my hands are trembling... I was so excited! Ah, that's great! Sorry to break your lingering excitement, but it's dangerous to stay there. Come with me. Okay. And... Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! L-loud?! How was it? Hm? With the new student? Did you get her hooked? Is she going to join? Ah, Tsurutama? She's– Uh... What's up? Thank you very much for today! So, about joining the club... I will have to decline, after all. Huh? Why? Well, because of, voice. Voice? Ah, uh, not “voice”... Uh, “love”! Huh? Gah! Ah, I get it, “love”, huh? You want to fall in love? Heh, well... Is that it? Uh, like, making friends, getting a boyfriend... And doing things I like with them... Or well, I want to have a typical university student life... I'll definitely do part-time jobs to pay the glider repair costs! So– 3 million yen! I'm sorry? It's the prize money for the glider championship. If you win, you'll get three million yen. Then you can pay it back all at once. Uh, but... And then, the boyfriend thing, right? Eeh? Sorachi! Hmm? Do you have a moment? Hm? Go out with Tsurutama! Eeh? What's that out of the blue? Oh? I thought you didn't have a girlfriend? Uh– that's not it– There's nobody other than you I can ask about this. Take good care of her! Got it! Huh?! Don't just say “got it”! She's a valuable new club member. Don't let her go! Got it! No, this is all messed up, you stupid old– You're friends, right? Got it! What is this?! The order is completely wrong here! 151 cm. Up, down, left... Your heart rate is a little bit low. You must be doing a lot of sports. Eh? It's nothing like that! Really? That's not ideal... what do we do about the certificate... It would be bad if we don't get it! Certificate? The aviation medical exam certificate... For gliders, you need this as well as a practice permit if you want to train! You should know this much, moron! Huh? How would I know this, plane nerd?! You two... this is a doctor's office! Thank you very much. Here. Hm? I paid for now. Pay it back later. Tsuru, Tamaki Receipt Tsuru, Tamaki Tsuru, Tamaki Tsuru, Tamaki Receipt Tsuru, Tamaki Tsuru, Tamaki Tsuru, Tamaki Tsuru, Tamaki Huh?! Expensive–! And also... And in May you'll be doing a week-long training camp in Menuma. Until then there's a lot of theory to learn. You better be prepared! Hey, wait! Hey! I said to wait! Stop running away! - TSURU - TAMAKI It's the real licence! Ouch! It's not a licence, it's a practice permit! Stop smiling, and Aonagi runaway! Runaway? To the runway, right away! Ah... wait! Everyone assemble! Stand in line! I'm the one in charge this year, Nanba Ryouhei, year 4. Now, a word from our director, please. This year like always: safety first! Eh? This guy also flies on gliders? Who would have thought... Hey! Be quiet! Captain's address! Attention, students! Aonagi University, Department of Science and Engineering, mechanical engineering, year 4. Kuramochi Jun. Serving as this year's captain of the Athletics Association's Aviation Club. Having been entrusted with this role, I want to achieve the results to show for it. Starting off... This year's goal: the inaugural Aonagi association championship! And then, national victory! National victory? Association championship? Pretty confident... Six of us will compete. This year, we will select only on merit, regardless of grade level. Fight to the death! That's it! Got it! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! It became even more like sports... 70 flights in one year, huh? If we don't stand out now, we won't get far! 70 flights? Ah, everyone's so ambitious! First years, shut up! Tsurutama, make sure to shout properly! Huh? Maki-chan? Your overalls... what a waste. Huh? What makes overalls overalls is the slack on the bottom! Here! The slack is not sufficient. Overalls one size up would be ideal! Eeh? Aren't the small ones also fine? They are not. Is that how it is? Huh? That's something you're supposed to know. More importantly, what even are those overalls? They should be white! Where did you even get that colour? Eh? Isn't it cute like this? Look, we've been wearing white overalls for generations now! Uh, but why isn't Kuramochi-san wearing white? Oh, you're right! Unfair! He gets to wear those overalls because he's our instructor. Eh? Instructor? You flew with him on the opening day! Being the instructor as a student is pretty rare. Eeh? And that's why he's wearing– Ah, hey! You! Hey! Ah, uh, can I... fly with you one more time? This girl...! I would be grateful! Sure. That doesn't sound bad. We'll fly right away. Get ready. Yay! Kuramochi-san... Aren't we going in circles around one spot? You... didn't Sorachi teach you the theory? Eh? What we're doing now is called thermalling. Th-thermalling? Thermal A rising air current is called a “thermal”. Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Thermal Moving upwards in a way that we don't drift away from it is called “thermalling”. Huh... I guess that's why we've been flying at a 30 degree incline for a while? I didn't tell you our bank angle, did I? Eh? Ah, no, even someone like me can figure out that much. No. There's no way a normal human can determine their own attitude in the middle of the sky. Except for someone with a special ability. What's going on? Change of plans. Eh? After we're done thermalling, let's try having you at the controls. Eeeh? Well done, Tsurutama. The first years are getting lunch. You should go with them. Alright! Heey! Tsurutama! Huh? The flight order is fixed! Don't just cut in line! Ah, sorry. I'll be careful from now on. That's not what I mean! Don't forget that you joined as a chore girl! You aren't the only new member! Don't get carried away just because Kuramochi-san is nice to you! Understood? Oh, hey! Huh? You didn't get lunch yet? Uh, yeah! I'm going now! Oh, first-year over there! Yeah? If you're going back, can you put this screwdriver away in the Discus hall? Sure. Into the blue toolbag. Don't get it wrong! Got it! With this, today's training is finished! Every team, situation report! Vehicle team! Yes! We have finished! That is all! Equipment team! Yes! There is one mini screwdriver missing from the Discus hall. We are searching for it. Make sure to find it before lights-off. If it doesn't turn up, we're not flying tomorrow! That's it! Dismissed! Alright! Not even a hunch? That's... Asanome-san! I'm sorry, I have the screwdriver. Oh, great! In my pocket– huh? Eh? No way! A hole– Hey, hey, are you serious? Where did you put it in your pocket? On top of the embankment near the runway. But it was in my pocket back then. This is bad... In any case, let's split up and search. I'm sorry, I didn't know it was this important... I will replace it! Eh, no– You moron! This is tool handling 101! Didn't you read the manual? What if you lost the screwdriver in an aircraft fuselage? What if it gets caught up in the control column? Because of this one mistake of yours, someone could easily die! We're all responsible here! Let's all look for it! Got it! Where could it be? Is it really here? How is it over there? Why did it turn out like this... At least use a flashlight. You can't see anything like this. Well, uh... I'm sorry. For being so harsh before. It wasn't very mature of me. No. The apology is on me. What's up with you? Normally you would talk back to me. I... make all these mistakes and cause everyone all sorts of trouble. I just remembered something I'd rather not have. What? Don't let it get to you like that. Even now I'm still causing trouble for everyone. I'm only even here because I broke that glider. I was wrong in thinking that people accepted me. What am I even doing... Tsurutama! It's like Kuramochi-san said. Half of that was my fault. So, don't worry about the repair costs anymore. If you really do want to fly, I'll support you no matter what. So... don't even think about quitting. Okay! I-if you got it, get on with the search! Thank you very much! If you don't end up finding it, we'll have to– Aaah! Eh, what?! It was here! Let's tell everyone! Senpai! I found it! Uh– really?! I'm so glad! Where did you drop it? Sorry for all the trouble... Aaahhh... Good morning! The sky is calm and blue! Wake up, everyone! Good morning! I feel so much better thanks to you. Thank you so much! First-year students, great job on your first training camp! Do your best next time as well! Well then, take your seats, and... Thanks for the food! Delicious! As expected, Kuramochi-san is amazing... First by a large margin... What are you looking at? The results from the national competitions in March. Kuramochi-san got first place in the individual division. There are more aviation clubs than I would have thought... Even just among the universities that are part of the federation, there are 59. That many?! You know how there's the Big6 university baseball league? There's also something like that for gliders. Wow... Oh, you were out here? Tsurutama? What's up? Kuramochi-san, you're a really impressive guy, huh? Huh? I thought about it a bit, and... I want to do my best in the aviation club! I see. I arranged for the amount we talked about earlier to be transferred to the secret account. Thank you very much. It's pretty unusual for you to come all the way out here. I hope you didn't come to tell me to stop again. I don't understand it. What are you unhappy about? I've said it before, but we didn't establish a break-even point for your investment. But if you decide to stop, it's a different story. Find someone to replace you. If you manage to do that, I'll let you do whatever you want. Finally we're here... Alright, everyone change and get to the runway! Eh? This time, we're doing a training camp with practice matches against another university. After we came all the way to Naganuma? This is why we came! But... don't worry! We'll also be doing all the usual fun trip stuff! Really?! Kirigamine Onsen Kirigamine Onsen See? Unlimited onsen access! Enjoy it as much as you want! Eeh... Hey, no playing around! As always, a team without discipline. Yano-san! Will you let me fly this time? Don't just go out showing off your skills before a competition. Save it for the match. If you say so... Good morning. You're late, Aonagi! Let's do our best in the training camp. Thank you for training with us! Uh– no way! Huh? Why are you here? Onee– chan...? Eeeh?! To think we'd meet again somewhere like this... This must be a bad joke. What are you going on about? What? Is this guy your boyfriend? She's a club member. Is that a problem? Kuramochi-san! I'd like you to tell me. Why is this girl in the Aonagi aviation club? I found and invited her... why do you ask? I want to hear the reason from Tamaki herself. This time, we accepted because it was Kuramochi-kun who asked us. But if this girl is here, we will not be participating in the training camp. Yano is your sister?! Yes. When we were kids, our parents divorced, and we lived apart from that point on. But even then, wasn't that really mean of her? Well, a lot of things happened... After this, we're meeting with the Hannankan people in the big hall. You don't have to come if you don't want to. The match is five days from tomorrow. Starting from Kirigamine, the turning points are Utsukushigahara-Ougatou and Yatsugadake-Akadake. Kirigamine U.-Ougatou Y.-Akadake The task is to fly through these three points, that is, a triangle of 80 kilometers, while competing on speed. In this area, there can be large changes in atmospheric conditions, and takeoff and landing are difficult. Therefore, the match will be carried out by competitors above a certain piloting skill level. For Aonagi, Kuramochi, Nanba, and Mochida will be competing. On our side, it will be Yano, Higurashi, and Sawa. We will be doing a practice match from 10 am tomorrow morning. Looking forward to it. Let's do our best together. Tsurutama, we'll start early tomorrow. Make sure to get enough sleep. Uh– yes! As always, Aonagi doesn't have anyone notable but you, Kuramochi. Really? Once I'm done training this girl, winning the national championships is not out of reach for Aonagi. Huh?! What? Are you joking? Well, after training, like I said. I'm pretty sure she has the guts to go for it. Seems like he likes you. You've always been like that, reading other people's emotions and getting favours from them. Sure, sure. She's also great at reading the room. Kuramochi-san, thank you. Ah. Don't worry about it. I know that Yano has this type of personality. Alright! Everyone dismissed! Assemble! The battle between Aonagi and Hannankan will now begin! Both parties... bow! Let's have a fair match! I'll be flying with her. Huh? Wait a minute–! Kuramochi-kun, what are you trying to do? Huh? Just as a ballast, but... One-seaters and two-seaters can't compete against each other! Don't be stupid! This girl is angry again? Looks like they're fighting over Kuramochi-san flying a two-seater. Huh? Why? Well, their performance is way different. For example, while Kuramochi-san's ASK 21 falls down one meter, it can go forward 33.5 meters. On the other hand, the single-seat Discus can go 42.5 meters. It can fly nine meters farther than the two-seater! Huh? Then why would Kuramochi-san go with a two-seater? Bullying? Eh? K-Kuramochi-san! The sea! We're in the landlocked Nagano prefecture. This is Lake Suwa. Amazing! The clouds are rising up from the mountains! Yano went up pretty far... Hannan LS, this is Aonagi 21. Flying over Kurumayama, altitude 2300. Are we visible to you? Aonagi 21, this is Hannan LS. You are visible to me. Intentionally doing a position report... this guy is so annoying. Kuramochi, huh... His thermalling skills sure are impressive... Aonagi Discus, e-entering landing pattern... uaaa– What was that?! The radio message just now... Mochida-san, what's up?! Are you okay? I feel sick from the thermals... If Menuma is like a typical swimming pool, then this is like going down river rapids... Kirigamine runway, this is Hannankan 23. Turning point 1 cleared. We did it! With this, Hannankan already cleared it with two planes... What about our Discus? Mochida-san returned without clearing any points, so Nanba-san started instead just now. Uu... I'm sorry... So at the moment, Hannankan is ahead of us 2 to 1. How many minutes has it been since Aonagi 21 went around turning point 1? 45 minutes. That's pretty late for Kuramochi-san... Get a position report. I just put it in, but there was no answer... About how long has it been since Kuramochi-san and Tsurutama took off? More than 2 hours. That's worrying... Kuramochi still hasn't returned? Nope... Why isn't he coming back with a bunch of time to spare like always... Oh! There! Kirigamine runway, this is Aonagi 21. Approaching the goal. They're here! We got a bit lost and took a detour. At least send us a message... Yeah, I should have... Sorachi-senpai! It was awesome! Everyone was worried about you... We flew above the clouds! It was like a dream... Flying waaay above the clouds, past the mountain peaks... with the sky reaching out to infinity! Huh? Past the mountain peaks... where did you guys go?! It really was... like a... dream... Tsurutama... hey! Hey, are you alright? Oh, Sorachi, you went with her? Hey... Kuramochi-san. Why did you take Tsurutama along with you? If something would have happened to her... I... Oh, Sorachi... I'm... sorry. Flight Information What is this? What's up? Kuramochi-kun. His flight today. He departed from the course and flew almost three times as far. Got lost, maybe? Idiot.

I walk straight without a stop Is that how it is? Kimi wo mite sou kimeta yo That's what I decided after I first saw you Do you... like to fly with Kuramochi-san? Yeah! Our flight yesterday made me like it even more! You're a beautiful bird I want to fly a lot more! Tsuki no shita de utatteiru boku mo Even when I sing under the moonlit sky Well, do your best! Yeah! Such a beautiful world tashika ni onaji sora wo miteiru Without a doubt, the sky we see is the same Let's eat! Tsurutama. Yesh? You should take it easy in your room for today. Eh? But I'm feeling great now– No. Sorry for overdoing it yesterday. Make sure to rest well. With this, our five-day practice match is over! Bow! Thank you very much! I wasn't helpful with anything... You. Do you still want to continue flying gliders? Onee-chan! If what Kuramochi-kun said is right, the next time we meet is at the rookie competition. Rookie competition? You don't even know about that?! This is what I hate about you. Tsurutama! Let's go! Yeah! Whaw ish she “woogie coweshishon”? Talking or eating, which one is it?! What is the “rookie competition”? Ah! You'll be going to the rookie competition next, right? I wanted to go as well... Until I can fly safely, I'm out. Tsurutama-san, you wanna go, right? No– actually, back when I joined the club, I broke a glider. I need the prize money to pay the damages. Prize money? Resignation notice There's no reason to stop, now that you've made it all the way to the rookie competition. I've already made my decision. But... Kuramochi-san! Huh? There's no prize money in the rookie competition. But Tsurutama-san wanted to pay back the broken glider with the prize money... Oh? Kuramochi. Didn't you tell her that the insurance took care of it? I forgot. Hey, hey. But I wouldn't want to spoil her newfound motivation. Let's keep it a secret! Eh?! Sorachi! Let's postpone our earlier discussion. Take care of Tsurutama until the competition, would you? Yes. The rookie competition is getting close! It's making me nervous! Don't get too worked up about it. The competition is tomorrow. Yes! Ah! A duck glider! Usually, participants who haven't trained at Kisogawa before are allowed one practice run. Really? I told you before... Hehehe... You'll be flying both ASK 21s and ducks at the competition. Think about which one you want to practice in! Wa– wait! What's up with him? Why'd he suddenly run away? Huh? Did someone drop this? JAPAN UNIVERSITY AVIATION FEDERATION KISOGAWA TRAINING SCHOOL Uh, excuse me... Tsurutama! Didn't you go for a practice run? Uh, I found a jersey someone lost over there... Ah, I'll take care of it. Apart from that... did you do a flight? No... Ah... I'm tired of this. Are you going to use your only chance without even being familiar with the land? Kuramochi-kun. I have no idea what you're expecting from this girl. You should give up your hopes before you end up being disappointed. Eh? You didn't fly? I'm sorry. Don't just apologise! You know well that the view from the sky is completely different to that from the ground! Are you serious... whatever... At least get a map of the area or something into your head. Yes. Satou-san! We found your jersey! Really?! Thank you so much! I'm so glad you found it! I had no idea what I would have done if I ended up qualified! Let us commence the All-Japan University Student Glider Match Championship Series opening ceremony. Hatori-san! You were the youngest person ever to receive a licence in Japan, right? Is there a specific reason why you chose to attend Hannankan University? You have no idea about glider flying, right? Eh– It's about time and money. Hannankan was the richest university in the vicinity. That's all it is. Ah– hey... Aonagi, huh? No one notable but the captain. Eh? Who's this? I didn't expect two shorties to come. Aonagi really does have a talent shortage, huh? Hey, you! What's up with this rude greeting? Did nobody teach you how to be polite? You should already know me. From the time at Kirigamine. Are you with Hannankan? Hey, little girl. You didn't bother flying yesterday, right? That's some self confidence! This time, there will also be points for speed. At the moment, I'm the best of the best in that regard. Well, do your best, girlie! Don't let it get to you. We'll just do what we always did! Yeah! I didn't think you'd seriously bring her along. You must really think highly of Tamaki. Well, kinda. She's our best candidate. Are you serious? The first time I let her pilot, I got goosebumps. Her spatial awareness and sense of orientation are incomparable. Even though she didn't know the theory at all, when I showed her how to do something, she was able to imitate it right away. Almost as if she is reading the winds acting upon the glider with her whole body. I've been waiting my whole life for someone like Tsurutama to show up. I hate this. My precious hobby, all being taken over by her... We've brought out our trump card. We're not going to lose. Go easy on us. Turning left. Left cleared. Good, Tsurutama! Height check. Heading 10 o'clock. Reporting: 21 is visible. Altitude 460. Distance to turning point 2... about 2 kilometers. I'm not flying high enough! What do I do? There are no... clouds... Tsurutama, get your altitude up! You can't catch a thermal without a landmark to go off of. If you want to see the invisible, you'll have to spend money. That's not something you'd use as a hobbyist. I think there's a positive current on the right. I'll try to get closer. She got into a thermal? What's going on? How can she get that? I did it! Amazing! Altitude 550. Heading towards turning point 2. That 13 sure went up! It's a blue thermal! What university is that? She came back! Aonagi, Tsuru. Goal confirmed. Recorded time: 32 minutes 32 seconds. Tentative first place. We did it! Nice, Tsurutama! We did it! We did it! I will now be announcing the results of the first day. Today's daily winner: participant number 33, Aonagi University first year Tsuru Tamaki-san. Congratulations. Th-thank you very much! I think she's the one who found your jersey! Well done, Tsurutama. Second place: Hannankan University first year Hatori Kaede-kun. Is Hatori-kun not present? Absence will be counted as withdrawal from the match! Hatori-kun? Are you not here? Hatori-kun? Ah, I'll go look for him! Please hold this for me! Ah– hey! What are you gonna do?! Boys' Room So this is where you were! Hatori! You should go back right away or they'll count you as absent! Come on! Let me go! Boys' Room What's with you? Did you come just to laugh at me? What would I have to laugh about? You're not particularly funny, Hatori. You're completely wrong, idiot! What's wrong with you? Leave me alone! Boys' Room Leave you alone? You wanna pretend there's nobody who beat you? Huh? After all, if you weren't there, it would be super boring! You wanna fly with me? I've decided that I'll defeat you in this competition! You're so annoying! Boys' Room So what? Wanna come at me? But you can't defeat me without a glider! Are you sure about that? Absolutely! There's no way I'll lose! You're a pretty weird girl! Come on now, do you wanna go back or be counted as absent? Hatori Kaede-kun. Congratulations. Hatori-kun. I'm Kuramochi, your judge for today. Nice to meet you. Huh? What are you here for? Are you gonna play favourites? Not at all! Hatori! I won't lose today, either! Oh, Kuramochi-san! Are you flying with Hatori today? Yeah. Hey, little girl. Don't mind me going ahead, I'll be waiting above you. I'm not gonna lose today even if I die. Better be prepared! Likewise! Number 33, Tsuru-san. Ah, yeah! Onee-chan! Today, I will be flying along with you as your judge. Nice to meet you. Tsurutama! You don't have any sunglasses, right? Use these. There's no copper in them. Is it really okay for you? Yeah. Thank you very much! Your instructor turned out to be... Yano, huh? Yeah... I can't really tell you to try to ignore it, but... just try to have fun in your own way! Yes! Kisogawa 21, riverside cable prepared. Mrs. Yano, looking forward to our flight. Likewise. Kisogawa 13, embankment cable prepared. Separation altitude 420. Commencing thermalling. Kisogawa 21, this is Kisogawa 13. Are we visible to you? Hatori? Yes, this is Kisogawa 21. You are visible. Little girl, you better have a good look now. This is Kisogawa 13. Kisogawa 21, entering airspace above you. Altitude 570. Eh? He specifically formed a gaggle right above the thermal Tsurutama caught? Heading 9 o'clock. Requesting visibility confirmation below. Maintaining separation approximately 150 meters. That close... This is difficult... Sorry, but there's no chance I'll lose to someone like you in this kind of place. Here! Eh– what? He figured it out. The strength at the core of the thermal where Tsurutama is. That's why he intentionally entered the same thermal and made a sharp turn. Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core Core He's reducing his turning radius and gaining altitude at the same time... Core Core Core Core To show off his difference in skill. Now entering a steeper bank and making a sharp turn. That idiot! She's never done a turn with such a steep bank angle before! Hey! Have you ever made a sharp turn at over 45 degrees before? I have not. Are you stupid? Our altitude is falling. I'm taking the controls. Wait, Onee-chan! Wait until altitude 400. I'm certain we'll make it. I entered the strong positive! I see it now! No way! Tsurutama...! I– I did it! Onee-chan! I did it! A-altitude 580. Heading towards turning point 1. You really haven't changed at all, huh. Eh? Whatever. This is Kisogawa, calling all stations. Message to all planes currently flying. We are anticipating a sudden change in weather conditions, so please descend quickly and proceed with a swift landing. Huh?! I repeat. This can't be... We are anticipating a sudden change in weather conditions, Aaaaaaaaahhhh! This stupid weather– ouch! The weather is the only thing you can't do anything about! Uh... you really saved me! Yeah! That's it! Back then I thought, “this can't be right”, Ah, Hatori! Come here! The meat is pretty tasty, right? She was good, wasn't she? I'm sure she'll become a good pilot. You have to recognise that at least a little bit. Look. She's eating meat together with our Hatori. Looks like she's made some other friends. Oh... is that bad? Nope. My mother died after giving birth to me. Tamaki is the half-sister I got after my father remarried. My father has always seen the traces of my mother in me. Because of that, I... always had to be the well-mannered daughter for him. I was jealous of Tamaki. Innocently getting along with everyone... and always laughing. Why couldn't I have been like that... Yano... I remembered it all the moment I met Tamaki. Despite the fact that I thought I'd already overcome all these miserable feelings. I'm really starting to hate myself. The champion is... Hatori-kun of Hannankan. JAPAN UNIVERSITY AVIATION FEDERATION Congratulations. Heh. Urgh... You're the runner up, little girl? Very sorry to hear that! Shut up. You're also amazing, senpai! You're in fourth place! That's a total failure for me... I had lots of fun thanks to you, Hatori! Oh... As I thought, you're a pretty weird girl! Well then. Tamaki! Oh... Onee-chan! Congratulations on your second place. Eh?! Don't look at me like that! No, but... Kuramochi-kun told me this. That I have to admit it. Kuramochi-san did?! But, this was pretty unexpected. I would never have thought that Hatori and you would get along. We aren't getting along at all! Thanks! I'm glad I was able to fly with you. If you meet Mum... greet her from me. Sure! I'll pass it along. Well then. We should meet again next spring. See you, onee-chan! Alright, let's also go home now. Sure! In his logic, there exists a completely fictional Japan. This is bad... I only did glider stuff until now... I don't understand any of this... Let's all go to the Land on the weekend! Oh, nice idea! Yuuta, wanna come too? Eh– yeah! Isn't this strange... Even if this might be what I was going for when I entered university... AONAGI UNIVERSITY COOPERATIVE CAFETERIA MENU Ah, found her! Tsurutama! AONAGI UNIVERSITY COOPERATIVE CAFETERIA MENU Hm? What awe you in shush a huwwy awout? There's a huge problem, come with me! Ah, my udon! - Sorachi, Daisuke - Resignation Notice - Sorachi, Daisuke - Resignation Notice Resignation Notice Resignation Notice Resignation Notice How did you girls get hold of this? Did you get it from Kuramochi-san? Sorry... I found it in the club room... Please explain. Uh... Are you really leaving the club?! Honestly, I initially wanted to quit after the Kirigamine training camp. Huh? Why? I want to become a pilot, so I'm dedicating myself to studying aeronautics. From year 3 onwards there's going to be a lot more practical training, so I won't be able to attend training camps anymore. Oh, is that how it is... You're really trying to become a pilot, Sorachi-senpai? Ah, well... Anyway, it's not like I'm going to quit university or anything like that. See you. Ah, Sorachi– senpai... Ah, screw this! If he still cares about us, why didn't he just tell us directly?! Eh? What about you, Tsurutama? Eh? Do you like Sorachi-senpai? Or do you like Kuramochi-senpai? Eh... Why would you ask about that?! Because Kuramochi-san is clearly into you, but there's a weird sort of distance between you two. And Sorachi-senpai is too shy to make a move, even though it's similarly obvious. Is that really true? This girl is really getting it in... It's not like I necessarily feel this way... Let's go for lunch! We need to have a good long talk about this. But, I ate udon just now... You can eat once more! Let's go! Kuramochi Youko-sama There have been no unusual developments today, either. Well then, if anything else comes up, please call for me. Thank you very much. Aonagi Discus, entering landing pattern. Aonagi, landing pattern, roger. Runway Bravo. You're pretty convinced that you can win the national championships in March, huh? I went through a lot of trouble for you to– I will definitely win. I've been flying for a thousand hours at Menuma alone. I'm not going to lose. Don't you want to move on from competing against university students? There are associations for young people, you know. Eh– Kuramochi. You should go to Germany. Because of Iruma, the local regime is tough here. I'll get you a ticket right away. From now on, your opponent will be the entire world. There's so much dust... When was the last time someone cleaned here... Can't you shut up while cleaning... But... What's this? Huh? A notebook? Ah, that's where it was! This is the club's exchange notebook. Kuramochi-san purchased the Discus after winning a competition? Eh? I thought there wasn't any prize money! Ah, that was when Kuramochi-san was in year 2. He talked to the university and to alumni and got them to buy it. Look, the one you broke at first, Tsurutama-chan! Eh? Really, that glider? That's right! Some of the alumni did help, but really, it was mostly Asahina-san. It's a plane we all have lots of memories about. Speaking of that, I haven't seen Kuramochi-san at all recently. You haven't heard?! Kuramochi-san has quit university... Eh?! The telephone number you have dialed is currently not in use. Nope, he cancelled his contract... No way... Eh– isn't this all way too sudden... Out of the way. With Sorachi-senpai and Kuramochi-senpai both gone now... I haven't really been motivated recently... Even though he said he'd win the national championships... How did the Aonagi aviation club turn out like this... What's up, Tsurutama? There were plenty of thermals you could have gone around on. I'm sorry. For some reason, I couldn't go up... I know that feeling. Let's switch over. Sure. That car... Asahina-san! What brings you here today? What brings me here? I just wanted to see how it's going. Sure, but... Kuramochi-san isn't here anymore, so... That Kuramochi asked me. To take care of Aonagi. Uh, excuse me... I'm Tsuru, first year. I heard what you were talking about before. Uh... is there anything you might know about Kuramochi-san? Are you the first-year Kuramochi set his eyes on? Yes. What was that flight earlier. No wonder Kuramochi became so useless, then. I sent him to Germany. There's nothing left for him to do at Menuma. Eh? But Kuramochi-san said we were going to win at the national championships... If you have to rely on Kuramochi to win... there's no way you'll win at all. Just so you know, the reason I came here today is to observe you. Observe us? I've come to invest in talents who I can entrust with my dreams. I have no intention to support an Aonagi that has become spineless after Kuramochi left. But... earlier, you said that Kuramochi-san asked you to. You. What are you to Kuramochi? Eh? Did you fall in love with him? If so, you should be honest about that– That's not the case. Are you trying to bully us? Why would you betray Kuramochi's feelings like this? I'm not betraying anyone. Tsurutama, what are you doing?! But... Asahina-san, we apologise. Don't worry about it. My connection to Kuramochi is simple. He is indebted to me. In return for purchasing the Discus for Aonagi, Kuramochi became mine. It looks like some idiot even broke that Discus. I was the one who broke it. I've been taking responsibility– I don't care about that. I'm going to come clean. There have been several times where Kuramochi requested to terminate the contract. I told him to find a replacement for him if he wants to stop. But in the end, he couldn't find one. About that... couldn't I be the one? Hey! What are you saying?! Can you do it? If you're saying that, it means you're pretty confident. I'll take you if you become as good as or better than Kuramochi. First off, to take part in the Kantou competition, get a certificate of competency. I'll get you ready for that. What's a “certificate of competency”? Shhh! Show me your win in the national championships. If you do that, I won't cut off my support of Aonagi, and I'll do whatever you want for you. Understood. Show some results. Let's start off with that. Tsurutama! Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Asahina, You Yes. It's me. Are you doing alright? Yeah. That's good. I just did a quick supply run to the Aonagi people. I met with the first-year you were interested in. With Tsurutama? Yeah. She was all on about how Kuramochi-san is doing. I see. What's up? Not happy about it? The rest of them have kind of lost their motivation without you. I told them that I'll cut off their support if they can't win the next championship. Asahina-san, that's–! I know. I'm playing the thankless role here. They need someone like me to be angry at. Private number I'm coming! Hello, Tsuru here. It's been a while. Eh? Kuramochi-san?! I heard from Asahina-san. I'm sorry. What's that supposed to mean?! Why did you quit out of nowhere?! Sorry for making you deal with my selfishness until now. I'm doing fine. Don't worry about me! Well then. Eh? Kuramochi-san? Tsurutama! Everyone's here to cheer for you! Sorachi-senpai, it's been a while since the Kantou competition, huh. You came running for Tsurutama in the end! It was Nanba-san who called me! You guys hear about Aonagi? Yeah. Looks like Kuramochi's gone. It's over for Aonagi. True that! What's up with those guys, deliberately making us overhear their insults? Every time I see you they become more lame. Aonagi's white overalls. Ah! Hatori! You're gonna fight with us as well? For the Onma people, you need to tell them directly how you feel. Toumaki, your insulting comments were the lamest! If you're angry, defeat me in your glider! Thank you, Hatori. Don't worry about it. It's not a real contest if they aren't competing with all their strength. Same goes for us! There's no way I could tell Kuramochi-san that we lost! First place's our aim! Hannankan, Hatori. Successive goal confirmed. This guy's pretty good. Eiou is also taking the lead. We're just getting started! - Then we'll do the afternoon flight as planned. - Dann machen wir den Flug am Nachmittag planmäßig. - Yes. - Ja. Yamada Hospital - Excuse me. - Entschuldigung. - Sure. - Hm-hm. Yes. Ah, good, I've been trying to get in touch with you. Did something happen with my mother? Yes. Just moments ago, Kuramochi Youko-san... has passed away. Since about two days ago, her pulse has been getting weaker, and I've tried to contact you, but... How's it going? Asahina-san! Glad to meet you. Tsurutama is flying at the moment. It's going great! She's second place, ahead of Hannankan! Oh? Tsurutama-chan and Sorachi-kun are giving their very best! As am I! Heheh... Is that so? I've fired you all up, haven't I? Oh? I've brought some refreshments. Distribute them for me. Sure! Thank you very much! I'll go return the keys to Asahina-san. Thanks! And then, did they find Kuramochi? I see. What they found was only the glider? Official sources are saying he crashed? Don't be ridiculous. No way... Leave it to the local police from here on. Yeah. That girl– Ah, we've already started eating! Huh? Come with me. Eh? Ah, w–wait– What? What's with you? I said I'm sorry we started eating without you– That's not what I mean, are you stupid? Kuramochi crashed– Everyone can hear you! Earlier, when Asahina-san was talking on the phone, I overheard this... As I thought. Uh– it wasn't on purpose... That's enough. I was going to tell you sooner or later anyway. What exactly happened? During his training in Germany, it appears that Kuramochi's glider has crashed. A corpse has yet to be found. But... that means his death is not confirmed! Yeah! In any case. Don't cause unnecessary unrest. Got it? Shit... Menuma runway, this is Aonagi Discus... entering landing pattern! - Altitude 220! - Eh?! Aonagi landing, roger that. Runway Delta. But... he was so close... Nanba-san! Shit! I'm sorry... after I finally caught up with everyone... Nanba-san. Was there something Asahina-san told you? I noticed when I was coming down before... Is that true? It's nothing! It's just that I couldn't fly. Mochida-san and also you, Nanba-san... You've been acting strange for a while! Is there really nothing– I said it's nothing! I'm sorry. Leave me alone for a bit. Nanba-san... You aren't going to tell us either, Mochida-san? Sorry. But...! You seem even more concerned about it! Let's stop this now. I'll tell you. Asahina-san? All of you, come to the training field later. Honestly, I was going to tell you all after the competition ends. It's my responsibility. This... can't be true... Kuramochi-san crashing? Withdraw from the competition. Why? You're all upset about this. There's no way I can let you fly in this condition. I'm not upset or anything. After all, there's no way Kuramochi-san would actually crash, right? I can fly! I believe in Kuramochi-san. So, I... don't want to stop. Me too! Please. If Kuramochi-san is alive, he would never tell us to stop partway through! Same for me. I don't want to give up now. What do you think? If they have made a decision... let them do it. However. You must not forget to be present of mind! Even the slightest lack of care might soon become dangerous. Yes! As the weather is not expected to improve later in the day, no matches will take place today. Well, just as expected... True... Will it get better tomorrow? If it doesn't, our second place is final. Tsurutama? Hey. Morning. Good morning! Oh, good mor– ugh! What's up with your eyes?! Ah... is it that obvious after all? I only cried a little bit, and then I slept just fine! So, I'm going to fly today! I'm fine! You want to fly first? Yes. Please let me do it. The last flight on the last day will be two hours earlier. Then I'll have two good chances to fly. So you want to move up the flight order and take Tsurutama off? No. We should let her fly the second flight. Uh? I'm sorry. It might mean that you won't end up flying yourself, Nanba-san. The conditions aren't great this morning. But, if the weather improves in the afternoon... I want to have Tsurutama fly! The only one who can turn things around in one flight... is her! Nanba-san. Okay. I'll leave it to you. Go out and fly, Tsurutama! Yes! I'll definitely come back around and link up with you. So you can just fly like you always do! Thank you very much! It's okay. I know Menuma perfectly by now. It's Hannankan. They've caught up. How about Sorachi? He's coming! Well done, Sorachi! What about the other teams? Eiou and Hannankan are both in the lead. The rest is up to you, Tsurutama. Tsurutama. Fly with all your strength! Yes! I'm going to fly the best I can, and I'm going to have fun! Huh, what happened? The little girl didn't fly first? Aonagi Discus. Preparation complete. Aonagi Discus, takeoff. Tsurutama, do your best! This is Menuma runway. Aonagi Discus, Hannankan LS, Eiou Discus. Please confirm visibility. Aonagi? Hannan LS. Altitude check, 750. Tamaki is flying for Aonagi, huh? Sorry, but I'm not going to concede! Eiou has cleared turning point 1?! Sorachi-senpai! You're also here? What about Tsurutama? She's flying right now. She's almost at turning point 1. Menuma runway, this is Aonagi Discus. Turning point 1 cleared. Altitude 950. Okay, great. We're holding altitude! Menuma runway, this is Eiou Discus. Turning point 2 cleared. Altitude 650. Menuma runway, this is Hannan LS. Turning point 2 cleared. Altitude 690. Menuma runway, this is Aonagi Discus. Turning point 2 cleared. Altitude 750. Tamaki! When did you– Menuma runway, this is Eiou Discus. Goal within reach. Altitude 570. Menuma runway, this is Hannan LS. Goal within reach! Three planes are coming in at once! You're right! Seriously?! Does this happen often? It's my first time as well! Goal confirmed. Three planes simultaneously? That means...? Tsurutama caught up after taking off late... That... means...? Aonagi has... won... Yay!! Tsurutama! They had to do it, huh... Tsurutama-san's glider... looks just like a bird! Yeah. Tsurutama!! Eh? Asahina-san! Let me go to Germany! Uh? You said that you'd do whatever I want if I won the championship, right? Uh... So...! Please take me to where Kuramochi-san is, right now! Well... but... No buts! You were the one who brought all of this up, Asahina-san. I'm going to Germany to look for him. There's not a single cloud today, huh. This is my chance. To catch a blue thermal and become happy. Kuramochi-san taught me that. I'm... going out to see the sky that Kuramochi-san flew in. Kuramochi-san, can you see it? It's a blue thermal.

Mama, Flugzeug! Ah, that's a glider! Ah, das ist ein Segelflugzeug! - It's unusual for it to fly all the way here. - Es ist selten, dass es fliegt bis hierher. Tsurutama! What are you doing?! You're going off course! Tsurutama! Answer me! Kuramochi-san... The sky that he saw... I want to see it too! Are you stupid? You'll crash as well! Even so! Maybe I'll find him with this Discus. To think she'd want to follow in his tracks... Aonagi Discus! Position report! Eh?! What's going on, Tsurutama?! Answer me! Aonagi Discus! Team sign! Radio check! Yes. I told you not to disappear again! When you were suddenly gone... Can you imagine how worried I was about you?! I want to fly so much more with you, Kuramochi-san! I want you to teach me even more! I want to look at the same sky! So... from here on out... will you fly with me forever? It sounds almost like you're proposing to me... I promise. I won't run away again. I'll wait here for you to come back. So... please come back, Tsurutama. Yes.
