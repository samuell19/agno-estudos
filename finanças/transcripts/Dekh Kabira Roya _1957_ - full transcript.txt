You Tube - Video Running Time 02:23:23 You Tube search name - Dekh Kabira Roya 1957 Come in Rekha. We've been waiting for you. I was late in getting the proof. - Deepa, when did you arrive? - I've been here since morning. Here, look. He's written the story... and is printing it in the paper. - Am I in it? - All three of us! Three heroes and three heroines. Read it for us. Life and Love Love is a precious gift of life. It's the mother in the blooming morning of life. It's a friend in the beautiful morning of life. It's a woman in the sultry afternoon of life. It's an innocent child in the evening of life. And when the night of life falls, love becomes one with the Maker. Love and life came into this world together. Love came to the cities and has witnessed many revolutions. Gradually the purity of love turned to lust. These days love is considered a thing. It is measured by thoughts, not emotions. Nowadays people love with their heads, not their hearts... and they love the exhibition of humans, not human beings. They fall in love with fame and competence. And the problems that are created by this... sometimes hand you over to the whirlpool rather than the shore. This story unfolds one day in the Janata Coffee House. - Good day sir. - Yes. It's been a long time. Where did you go? - To commit suicide. - Successful? No. I didn't have money for the rope. You should have asked me. I'd have lent it! What a coward! Your life is starting and you want to end it! You would say, you'd make a great painting. You'd go abroad! You'd get 1000 rupees! If you want to enjoy, you must fight life! Fight tooth and nail! Get it? Now tell me, hot or cold? - Water. - I know. Plain water. May I sit here? Sure. I don't own the seat. Hello. Fine? Excuse me, I've been sitting at this table for six years. If you don't mind, may I sit here today too? - Sure. - Thanks. - Good day sir. - Good day. - I know you love water. How many glasses? - Just one. - One glass cold water. - Not cold! Hot, boiling hot! Cold water will ruin my throat. You seem to be fond of singing. That's my profession. I'm a born singer! I've been singing since birth. My voice is sweeter than Talat Mehmood and Manna Dey. I can sing in a pitch higher than Mohammed Rafi. And can sing lower than Hemant Kumar. Alas! Fate! No music director gives me a chance! But a day will come when every music director will want me! Lovely! That's nice. If a dog can have its day why can't a man's day come? That was about me. What are you guys? I'm a small writer. You must have heard of Triveni. The Triveni where the rivers Ganga, Jamuna and Saraswati meet? No, this is not that one. It's a paper and I'm the editor and owner. - You must have read it? - I have no time to die! Which is precisely why newspapers don't sell. I print 2000 copies of this paper. 200 are sold. The rest goes as trash. 6 annas a seer and the seer is made of 12 ounces. Say what? Excellent business sir! - Hot water... - Boiling hot? Will you only have water, or eat something too? - One cold coffee. - Cold coffee. And you? Hot for me. Absolutely hot! Hot water, hot milk, hot cup. If possible hot sugar too! What about you, sir? No milk, no sugar. Without milk or sugar? What's your problem? Why do you drink black coffee? All the great painters of the world paint with the blood of their heart. They would drink black coffee and wear black shrouds. So you're a painter? Let me see. Lovely! What a sketch! I hope you're in your senses? No one even looks at my pictures, and you're praising it? Of course. I can print it in my paper if you wish. There are takers for my sketches even for free! - And you want to print it? - Why not? - Where do you live? - Close by. I'd like to see your other paintings. My house? You want to see my paintings? I'll bring them here. Or to your office. Why do you want to trouble yourself and come home? I'll be glad. Come on. - Will you come? - Sorry, I've got to go to a studio. - I have a trial recording. - Then we'll meet tomorrow. Here. Let's shake on that. What a combination! Black coffee, cold coffee and hot coffee! What a combination! - Who'll pay for this? - You pay it today. I'll pay later. - Who'll drink it? - You. Hot coffee! Cold coffee! Come in. No need to fear. This is my humble home. - Come on. - Unlock the door. - I've lost the key. Come on. - Where? Open sesame! Did you see that? Come in. It's pitch dark in here. Switch on the light. Don't talk of lights. The bills are too much. The other room is well lit. Come. - How do you work here? - I paint at night. - And during the day? - I try to sell it. Open the window. You don't have to pay for sunlight and a breeze. This window is more dangerous than the light. The main door locked. Entry is from the back door. Lights off, window shut. Do you mind if I ask a question? - Yes? - Is this your house? Yes! No point hiding from you. I haven't paid the rent in six months. My landlord lives across. If he finds out I'm here, I'll be in trouble! You'll die of suffocation! Don't worry, I'll pay the rent if he asks. And if he says something wrong, I have a pen and a paper. I'll raise a storm against him! - Please don't. - I'll see what he does! Your landlord seems very strict. I did tell you! Father, get up! - Who is it? - It's me, father. I thought your mother had come. It's only 5 o'clock and you went to sleep! Five in the morning or evening? You never remember anything! - Do you know I just saw him? - Keep looking at him. - Who did you see? - The painter. I was standing by the window and finally saw him. - I'll just call him! - It's teatime. lnvite him for tea. For the rent, not for tea! He'll pay it later if not now. And even if he doesn't pay... it's our good fortune that such a famous painter lives in our house. Our house isn't an inn! Today I'll get the rent! Ramu not Shamu. Go and call him. - Who? - Him! - The painter? - Go fast. - Right. Master said he's at home but the door is locked. I warned you not to open the window. But you paid no heed! Now tell me what to do. - I'll go and see. - No! Don't go! If he discovers the back door, I won't be able to come here! Don't you worry. I'll sort it out. - Do you want to break the door? - Master has called you. Which master? Younger or elder? - Elder. - Elder. - Hello. - Hello. What do you want? Nothing. You tell me what you want. - Nothing. - How funny! You sent your servant. I gave you my house assuming you're a good sort. I'm not your tenant. I'm his friend. - Who called you? - He's busy so I came. - What did you want to say? - I won't talk at all! - I want the rent! - He'll give it. He's shown me his face just once! Comes and leaves like a thief! I never said a word this long. But today I want the rent. - How much is it? - For 6 years. - 6 years? - No, 6 months. - Pardon? Wait. - Rekha - Yes? - How much does the rent total? - Nothing. - Nothing. - What? How is that possible? I want the rent today. Understand? Yes. What do you think of us? We are artists not thieves. You must look at the helplessness on our faces, our torn clothes. Our empty pockets. Artists create for you, not themselves! You adorn your drawing room with our paintings. You entertain yourselves with our music. You exercise your brains with our writing. Without our art, your world wouldn't be beautiful! Interesting. If you still consider us so debauched and lowly... here is your rent. 2 rupees 12 annas. I'll pay the rest later. Don't be offended. That's not what father meant. - Right, daddy? - Definitely not. - Keep this. - No, let it be. Please keep it. Don't worry about the rent. Consider it your own house. Right, father? Yes, absolutely your own. And he can stay here as long as he's alive. Thank you. Good day. Excuse me! Don't take father's words to heart. God knows what has happened to him since mother passed a way. - I hope you're not offended. - Not at all. In fact, I'm glad to meet you. Me too. I've wanted to meet you since you first came here. - Meet me? - Yes. You wouldn't know how much I respect you. You're such a great painter! Me? You are mistaken. - I'm just a small... - Your saying won't make you small. - No, I'm just a small... - Forget it. I know. Fine. If you say, so be it. I, too, am fond of painting. I use the brush sometimes. Lovely! Okay, good day. Listen, I'll come along. I want to see your paintings. My paintings? You want to see them? That's very nice. But not now. - Why not? - That painter... My friend? He's working there. - So what? - No, you mustn't go when he's there. Some other day I'll show you the paintings. Are you happy now? Okay, bye. I have fallen for you, my love With my hands on my heart... and together with the stars... I stayed up all night, my love The twinkling stars have started setting... taking turns, one by one The glow has also begun to steadily dim The brightness has also started to pale. Even the moon has got tired from its travels But those in love are still not tired The whole world was sound asleep, lost in dreams Even the lovely breeze had stopped The waves were also subdued Then why I was not able to sleep? This no one is able to explain I have fallen for you, my love A number of times the moon asked me... what was going on with me "For whom have you started doing penance?" "Whose disciple have you become?" All I could manage to say... was that I had been stricken by love I have fallen for you, my love - What happened? - A whole lot. Everything is fine. Now you can shut this door and open the front. Your landlord is very nice! He has excused your rent. - What? - No more paying rent. Thank you very much. I'll go and thank him. No! No need to do that. I've fixed everything. I must. I'll be back! - Good day. - You just wished me and left. That was my friend, not me. - What do you want? - You excused my rent. Thanks. But some day I'll pay your rent. But you must work hard on your paintings. - Make good paintings. - I will. - Make a portrait for me, too. - Sure. - What shall I get you? Plain water? - No way. Today I want coffee! With milk and sugar! But you drink black coffee and paint. Then I'd paint. Now they sell. Quickly coffee with milk and sugar. Yes sir. Milk and sugar... - I'm dead! - What happened? The neighborhood wants me out! I've changed 60 houses in 6 years. They always throw me out. They'll make me vacate today too! - Why? - Because I sing. If I don't sing, Hemant Kumar will always retain his position. And Talat Mehmood his position. And I'll always remain Mohan! - What do I do? - We must go to Pradeep. - Pradeep? What will he do? - He can do everything. He can do anything with the power of the pen! Your voice and my brush can't do it. The pen is mightier than the sword. He can fight the whole world with the force of his pen! - Know what he did yesterday? - What? He got me excused from paying rent like this! Can he get my singing started? Yes, like this! Let's go. - Your coffee with milk. - You drink it. - Where is your master? - He was here. He must have gone to the press. - I'll get him. - I'll come with you. - Can I come in? - Yes. The gathering is excited because the admirer has come. Flame, hold your heart. The moth has come. Excuse me, I've come to bother you. - I sent some stories by post. - Very good. - But they didn't get printed. - Very good. - But won't they get printed? - Never. You must have something on your mind. Thinking? I'm dying! Matter of life and death. - New plot? - Not by itself. It has a building. And an entire neighborhood. A serious situation. Sounds like a detective story. No detective works here. All are middle class people. No way. Only hatred. Cruelty, atrocities! Got it! Problem story. Exactly! Only problems. On one hand you have a poor singer. On the other, the entire neighborhood wants to evict him. And he's asking an editor for help. Have you thought of an ending? God alone knows. I've been thinking for two days. No solution. Terrible situation! Don't worry. Tell me the gist. I'll give you a solution. - Really? - Yes. - Tell me. - Sit down. - Tell me fast. - Wipe the sweat. How have you found the solution so fast? A woman can complete a job in minutes that might take a man months. Man thinks a lot and woman understands more. Explain it to me, too. Tell me the solution. - Pradeep isn't here. Let's go. - Hold on! She's giving me a solution. Please hurry up. She can't do anything. You come with me. No, only she can help me! - I'll come with you. Come on. - Listen... - Don't go, I'll come back. - Okay. Your house is very nice. Yes, but I'm being evicted! Nobody can throw you out. Start singing, come on! I know my neighbors well. You dragged me for nothing. That lady was solving my problem. Forget the lady. Sing. The song is getting me evicted. Will you get my bones broken? You have to sing if you want to stay here. How high a pitch? - Whose tone? - Anyone's. Sing as loud as you can. I'll see who comes here. Sir, bless me. Mother, hear that? Who must that be? Sounds just like a Banarasi. We've got a house in such a good neighborhood. Scolded him in the morning yet he has no shame! He's so thick skinned! Beat him with this broom! God knows where he has come from! Doesn't let us sit in peace! Made our lives miserable! We'll see about this! Will you stop singing or not? - Why did you stop singing? - He would if I wouldn't! He can't do that. Start again. No, you don't know. He's no priest but Pesha Warilal! He comes, goes, beats with a stick! I'll handle him. You start singing. I'm dead! This son of Tansen stops, then starts singing again. But I'll stop him! Or I'll change my name. I'll break his head! Halt! Why are you yelling? Is he harming you? He doesn't let us sit, eat or sleep! Keeps singing all the time! - He sings in his house not yours. - That's right, but I hear it. Then shut your door! Bravo! If you hate music, why do you sing hymns for God? Why do you sing prayers? Why go to temples? If music is found there, why not here? She is right and he sings well. Go to your houses. I'll go to mine. He sings well. Okay? I'm going. We're dead! I'll check. Why are you folks yelling? What right do you have to interfere if one dances, sings in his house? Don't listen if you don't want to. Stuff cotton in your ears! Leave this house! Don't interrupt! Complain to the police! File a suit against us! But the song won't be stopped! Never! - It mustn't. - Thank you. What did you say? I don't want the song to end but to continue. To continue? My song? You sing so well! - I sing well? - Such pain in the voice! In my voice? Please sing the song you were singing. I must sing? Here? - Then let's go to the room. - Room? Listen, get up. The fact is... We live in this society. What will people say? All right. Then come to my house. - Where do you live? - Above you. You mean on my head? In the room above yours. You go to your house. And I'll go to my room. - Where are you? - Under the cot. What happened to Pesha Warilal? Gone! Now you needn't fear. You can sing day and night. Anything you want to sing! - You are great! - Come out. Sit here. - Sing. - Sing? - Yes, I promised them. - No, I can't sing! - My throat is sore! - Earlier they wanted to evict you for singing. Now they'll evict you if you don't sing! Understood! I'll start. Who has come? Who has come to my mind's doorstep? I hear the sound of anklets The eye does not know, but the heart recognizes... a distinctive face like this I cannot remember even if I try... an image quite like this This crazy mind, lost in thought... building a world of dreams One moment I think, my desire... has appeared in front of me in a different shape The next moment I begin to fear... that this not be just a shadow... that has come to a stranger's place... with a strange sort of love Who has come to my mind's doorstep? I hear the sound of anklets Who has come? Plain water. Cold water. Hot water. - Today water doesn't taste nice. - Why? What happened to you? What would you know? Since yesterday a plot is in my head. But I couldn't write a word. The noise in the press, business tension and people coming and going. - Then you can write in my room. - Your room? Yes, that's right. You can paint anywhere. If you don't find any place, you can go to my room. - But what about you? - The Lord will take care. I'll go to a temple and practice. Mohan, you can go to my office if you wish. - What's the use? - Why not? Your office? Good thought! Machines will run and I'll sing. Nobody will hear me or stop me. I'll practice so hard that Hemant Kumar and Talat will be out of films! People coming and going. Give me the key. - I don't have it. The peon has it. - Peon? - Let's get it from him. - I must come? Okay. - May I come in? - Sure, lady. - I am called Kalpana. - That's a lovely name! - Please take a seat. - Thanks. - How are you? - Thanks to you. You left yesterday but I waited for you for four hours. - You waited for me? - One has to. And I didn't turn up. That's very bad. lncorrect! I should be ashamed! I should kill myself. Don't be mad at yourself. For your sake I won't be harsh on myself. - Forget it. - How is your terrible situation? - Sorted out. - What's the end? Happy ending. I've written a new poem today. Will you print it? Why not? New, old, anything, I'll print it all! It goes like this. The heart will need the heart. The heart will need the heart. Then I will be at peace. Excellent! The heart will need the heart. Then I will be at peace. Further, you, too, will be maligned. Further, you, too, will be maligned. I, too, will be accused. That's terrific! You will be maligned. I, too, will be accused. The last verse... Why do you fear infamy? Why do you fear infamy? Whose name will remain forever? Fantastic! Give this to the press. It has to be printed now. - But sir? - Nothing doing. Do as I say! - Are you happy? - Thanks a lot! I want to trouble you a little more. Trouble? At your service, madam. Please have dinner with me if you are free. - Dinner? - Any objections? Objections? I'm fed up eating at hotels! - You eat in hotels? - That's right. Hotel or market or starve! Terrible situation! - Then come on. - Right away! It's only the brave who fall in the battlefield! Is he your younger brother? No. Elder brother. Fifteen years elder to me. Fifteen years! Then he's elder to me, too! - Good day. - Live long. I'm called Captain Arjun. Is this your name or your entire team's? His name is Arjun, the rest are like the cricket ground. - Glad to meet you. - Who are you? - He's a famous writer! - Famous writer? The editor of Triveni. You've heard of Triveni? - I don't think so. - Neither have I. - Funny! - You are being funny. Who calls me a writer? They will someday! I'm sure! I'll talk to him. You ask them to serve lunch. - Take a seat. - Sure. Good! Very good! Don't read these. I wrote them long ago. What are you saying? Old is better than new. Old literature or music. Old furniture... old shoes... are better. I kept calling for you, you kept torturing me My dear, what sort of love is this really? Don't harass me like this. Don't torture me like this I have already told you that I do love you Where have you learned to complain like this? It is not good to have habits like this You don't even smile. You don't even come close How do I know this is indeed love? Don't harass me like this. Don't torture me like this I have already told you that I do love you I kept calling for you. You kept torturing me My dear, what sort of love is this really? I have already made you mine My heart is already lost to you I am also yours. Take my word for it When did I ever say I hate you? I kept calling for you. You kept torturing me My dear, what sort of love is this really? Don't harass me like this. Don't torture me like this I have already told you that I do love you I kept calling for you. You kept torturing me This song of yours is very nice. I wrote it for a film company. - But they rejected it. - Film men never like good things! They've rejected me, too! Forget them. But, you write well. I'm writing a new story. I want to discuss it with you. - Discuss a story? - Yes. - Am I a writer? - Yes, and no ordinary writer. - A very good one! - Terrible situation! - Terrible situation again? - Yes. Every situation is terrible for me. You're too much! I'll give you the gist of the story. It's lunch time. Let's meet at Janata Coffee House. - Janata Coffee House? - Yes. - Why? Many great men visit it. And they're all my friends! You too are in trouble. So am I! There's no place better than Janata Coffee House for this. - What time should I come? - About 3 or 4. I'll be there at 4 sharp. - Let's have lunch. - Sure. Lord! Protection! So this is your teacher? Yes. The poor man is dead. - Were you waiting for me? - Yes. Since morning. I'm in grave trouble. When I started singing Bhairavi, I was in quite a fix. I couldn't understand whether 'tha' is sharp or soft. You can use any one you want. That's not possible. It has to be one or the other. Both can be used. My teacher used either. Then it may be possible. Please sing both for me. Sing? I told you once... we live in a society. If I sing and somebody sees you, it won't be nice. You'll never sing for me? Of course I will. But outside, not here. - At the sea shore. - Then let's go there. At this hour? It's very hot. - Then? - Do one thing. Meet me at Janata Coffee House at 4 o'clock. - You'll sing there? - I won't sing! We'll have coffee. It will clear the throat. I'll go and ask mother. - Will she also come? - No. I'll just get permission. - Janata Coffee House. - 4 o'clock. Hello. Hello. How are you? As if you care! Where were you all night? I kept waiting for you. I even kept dinner for you. - Why didn't you come? - I'd gone to a friend's house. - I was working. - You paint at night, too? All great painters work at night! And try to sell them during the day. - Really? - Yes, come in. Excellent! - These paintings are so nice! - Yes. Each one has its own class. Who is this? This? A girl. Which is why I ask... Who is she? She... once she was a model. - Absolutely. - Then I, too, will be a model! Paint my portrait, too! Me? I can't paint you! Why not? - Am I not worthy? - No, I'm not worthy. What? You're such a good painter! That's the problem. You think I'm too good a painter. But I know that I know nothing. Look at these paintings. Hanging since they were painted! - Not one got sold. - So what? I'll buy all your paintings. You? All the paintings? - Now are you happy? - Yes. Very! - Will you have tea with me? - Tea? - Come along. - Thanks but the fact is... I don't like tea at all. I drink coffee. So we'll make coffee for you! Coffee at home isn't fun. It's fun at Janata Coffee House. Will you come with me? But how can I come without asking father? - Then ask him. Will you come? - All right. - At 6. - Fine. Listen... at 4, not 6. It's very crowded at 6. All kinds of people come. All right, I'll come at 4. What shall I get you? Hot coffee or cold? A glass of water. Water. - Plain. - Water... plain. How are you? Long time no see. Involved with singing. I was going to buy a tanpura. Thought I'd have a glass of water. - Sit down. - Are you going? - Sit... - No, you sit. I have an appointment with the tanpura seller for 4 o'clock. Water... What are you staring at? Get me some coffee. - Cold or hot? - Hot. - Where have you been? - Don't ask. Busy with a painting. I see. Found free time today? Today, I was going to the art gallery. Dropped by for coffee. You sit. I'm leaving. I have to reach the art gallery by 4 o'clock. It's already past four. I'm going. You sit. Hot coffee, madam. What's wrong? What's wrong? Help! What's the matter? - The bearer fainted. - How? He saw me and fainted! - What? - I'm too pretty! Returned from the art gallery? Yes, no... - Actually... - Don't worry. This is the first step of love. Why do you cry? Wait and watch what happens ahead. Let's be together by ourselves. We are crazy birds We have one tune We have one destination We are crazy about love Leaving this earth behind... we have to go beyond the clouds Picking out beautiful stars in the sky... we have to build our own nest We have one focus We have one sense of fun We have the same tales to tell We are crazy birds My heart's desire tells me... not to ever stop Even if these stars are threatened by storm... don't think of hiding from them Love is like a flame We are true to our hearts So we are like moths circling love We are crazy birds Now that we have set out together... we will definitely find our destination The heart where we are to make our homes... we will definitely find that heart We crazy people have set out today... to set up a new world for ourselves We are crazy birds We have one tune We have one destination We are crazy about love We are crazy birds It's 10 o'clock. Time for the coffee house to shut. We don't let people sleep here. Sir, who will pay the bill? - What for? - 30 glasses of water. - And 15 pounds... - Of ice. You pay it. I went to the coffee house but I couldn't meet you. I met a friend so I had to leave the place. I know you must be hurt. But I couldn't help it. I apologize. Forget it now! Go away. Thief! Father, thief! The love of the girls of today is a farce. They pretend to be in love. False smiles. False promises. They consider love a game. Their love is a deception, fallacy, fraud. That's wrong. If I couldn't meet you that day... - it doesn't mean I cheated you. - But you promised to come there! And I came there. But a friend came by and I couldn't wait for you. - Who are you? - I...! - What do you want? - Nothing! - Why have you come here? - Help! I apologize because I couldn't meet you at the coffee house. My friend showed up and I couldn't wait for long. You are angry with me. Why are you breaking the records? - Don't break it. - Let go! I don't want to talk to you! Who are you? Mother! Had it! Lady, be conscious. Fan! Shoe! Lady, get up! Did you have to find my house to swoon? Get up. Sit down lady. Take this fan. Fan yourself. Everything is in place. Did the thief come for the paintings? When the painter gets nothing, what would the robber get? No thief came here. Father is strange! Get a lock. The big one? Hurry up. - You? - Thank God you've come. Thief! - In your room. - A thief in my room? - Where is he? - He's not here but he was. When I came to see you, he was sitting here. You are being ridiculous. He was my friend, not a thief. He doesn't have any stuff so he comes here to work. These days the weather is bad. Everything goes wrong, everywhere! - Really? - Yes. - You're not mad at me? - Mad at you? I can't be. - Paint me today. - Your portrait? Here's a sheet of paper. Begin. Fix it. Begin. Get some water. Cold water. Ice water. Ice water is bad for the throat. Not to drink. To pour over my head, cool me down! - How many buckets? - One. You're back? What's wrong with you? - Look into my eyes. - Why? - Can you see? - Yes. - What do you see? - Yes. What? - My face! - Had it! - What? - Look at my face not yours! - I can see that. - Don't you want to swoon? - No. - But a girl just fainted on seeing me. - Girl? - Yes. A girl! - Where? - In my room. - In your room? - Exactly. - Was she alone? - All alone. - Who was she? - God knows. She came to your room and you don't know her? Maybe she stays in the society. Came to my room by mistake. Terrible situation! I've brought the water. Found a bucket not pail. - Take it away. - Okay sir. I apologize for not meeting you in the coffee house. - She said the same thing. - What? You asked her too? No. I'd asked you but she was apologizing. Strange! She apologizes to you there. And a man got mad at me here. - I've had it! - Who was he? He is... my assistant. - Where were you since morning? - Where was I? A song's been on my mind since last evening. - I was involved with it. - I see. Let me hear it. I'm still thinking about it. I'm tired, hungry, thirsty, dying! I'll get you something to eat. You'll get food for me today, too? Yes, I'll get it. What makes you ask? I had my mother then, and now it's you. Who has come to my mind's doorstep? I hear the sound of anklets Who has come? The eye does not know, but the heart recognizes... a distinctive face like this I cannot remember even if I try... a distinctive face like this This crazy mind, lost in thought... building a world of dreams Who has come to my mind's doorstep? I hear the sound of anklets Who has come? One moment I think, my desire... has appeared in front of me in a different shape The next moment I begin to fear... that this not be just a shadow... that has come to a stranger's place... with a strange sort of love Who has come to my mind's doorstep? I hear the sound of anklets Who has come? It's ready. You may see it. Let me see! - What's this? - Your picture. Do I look like this to you? Yes, absolutely. I could never make it better. This is what I can really call my creation. You don't understand. I'll explain. Tell me what's most beautiful in the sky. - The moon. - Exactly! A moon like face. I mean, your face. Symbolism, you see. Hair, like dark clouds. Your hair. Plaits like snakes. Bow shaped eyebrows. Almond shaped eyes. Pearly teeth and pot shaped neck. - This is classic! - Really? - I'll send it to London! - No! I won't let it go! I'll keep it! I'll buy it! I'll take it now and show father! Look at this, father! - It's nice. - What nice? Look carefully. A map. Which country's? Map? It's a picture. My picture! Yours? Are you like this? The picture is like me. It's called symbolism. I'll explain. Face like the moon. Hair like dark clouds, plaits like the snake. And eyebrow shaped bows! And bow shaped eyes! Eyes... Snakes, almond bows. - Have you gone mad? - No! It's a classic! And I'm buying it for 500 rupees! 500! Your Pop's money? Exactly! But you don't have to pay cash. Cut it from the rent. So this is what the painter has done! Is this why I excused 6 months rent so he'd make fun of my child! Tell him to make a nice picture. Or I'll evict him! I should get it by tomorrow evening. You ruined my picture! What are you doing here? - Fanning myself. - Are you all right? - Not at all. - What do you mean? - Inside. - Inside? Everything is gone! You're stripped of all your wealth. What are you saying? A man had come. He broke all your records! - Now what will happen? - To the records? Nothing. - Can't anything be done? - Sure, it can be done. As long as my voice is intact, I can record many records for you! But who was he? - He, he is my student. - Student? Yes, for six years now. But he hasn't learned anything. He's a complete ass! By now a real ass would have learned everything. Don't worry about him. I won't let him come here again. Now are you happy? I hope you aren't angry? Angry? With you? Then come home with me. - Your house? - Yes, mother likes your songs. - Your mother likes them? - Yes. - My songs? - Yes. Come. - Mother! - Yes dear? - See who has come. - Who is it? The one who lives under us and sings every day. Live long. Your voice sounds like a Banarasi. - My voice? - When did you come from Banaras? - From Banaras? - Banaras is great. I spent half my life there. I wish God would make cities like that. Bathe on its ghats. Wear its silken sarees. And chew betel-nuts there. Don't get taken in. She lives in Bombay but her mind is always there. Why are you standing? Sit down. Geeta, give him some sweets. Where are you going? I ate those inside. - I'll get them from the market. - Don't bother. We don't let anyone leave without having a sweet. I like your songs. Sing a hymn if you don't mind. What, a hymn? Lord blessed you with such a sweet voice. You must only sing hymns. Actually I can't sing. I can't sing at all! Geeta has made me a singer. Forget about that. Take the Lord's name and begin. Just like we don't let anyone leave home without a sweet... similarly without singing too. Come on. I'll begin if you say. Your throat is clear. Why are you doing this? I will. Hari, Hari (name of the Lord)... protect my dignity, Hari Keep rhythm, mother. You know everything, you Omniscient one! You know, yes... You know everything You know everything, you Omniscient one! Nothing escapes you, oh my Lord Protect my dignity, my Lord! - You also sing, son. - Carry on. No, no, my son, you should also sing. I am unable to rid myself of bad habits I am unable to rid myself of bad habits Help to purify me, my Lord! Protect my dignity, my Lord! Son, why are you quiet? Sing along! - What's going on? - I was singing a hymn. - Hymn? - Yes. - What happened? - Nothing. Don't worry. Take this. Father didn't like it one bit. I did tell you but you wouldn't listen. Nobody likes my paintings. So I've decided to stop painting and start writing. I'll become a writer! - You'll become a writer? - Have you heard of Triveni? I am its editor... I mean my friend is. You must have read it. How is it? Third class! - Absolutely bogus! - Absolutely bogus! If you become a writer, I won't talk to you. Don't worry. I won't! I'll always remain a painter. Happy? Now paint my picture. You haven't forgotten the picture? No, father said... if you don't make a nice picture, he'll evict you. He'll throw me out? I'll have to leave? Do you have a photo of yourself? - Yes, many. - Get me one. I'll stay up at night and paint a nice picture. Show it to your father. He'll be very happy. - Really? - Yes. I'll get one now! I've bought a new tanpura. - How is it? - Very nice. - Teach me one song. - You'll learn from me? - And today? - Yes. Fine. You look worried. Why do you care? You want to learn a song. - What's the matter? - Matter of life and death! And the decision is in your hands. My hands? Speak clearly. Should I? Wait. Look at this. - This is me! - How is it? - Beautiful. Who made it? - I did. - Do you also paint? - That's what I do. - Singing is only a hobby. - Really? Yes. I've decided I'll stop singing and only paint. - You'll stop singing? - Yes. Nothing much in singing. I've been singing for years. I've taken so many tests but not passed. I have wasted my life! So I've decided to stop singing and become a painter! If you become a painter, what will happen to me? Don't worry. I'll find a teacher for you. No! You must teach me. At least teach me one song. - I'll always remember it. - Sure you will. But tomorrow not today. Not in the mood today. Doesn't matter. Better tomorrow. Have a seat. - What are these? - Manuscripts. My songs, poems, stories, novels... - For whom? - For you. Have you written all these? There's more. If you don't like these, I'll get others. This is enough. I'll print all this now if you wish. Then I'll give you something fresh. Terrible situation! Listen... Reproach. Lovely! Let me see. I couldn't come to you You could not reach out to me This gulf in our love... could not be bridged by either of us I remember that moment... when I first met you There was some sort of sign Two hands came closer... and things clicked As time passed by... the day set and night came on Until now, I have not forgotten that magical moment How were we to know... that we met only to be separated? Our fates had been intertwined... only to then be destroyed Our garden of love had been planted... only to be destroyed And it was destroyed in such a manner that... we could never again manage to rebuild it Only memories remain Time just passes by Flowers do bloom again... but then they fade away again Everybody goes away... but the pain in the heart just does not go away Those scars that you gave me... have still not been erased from my heart I could not come to you You could not reach out to me This gulf in our love... could not be bridged by either of us I could not come to you You could not reach out to me I could not come to you I had no idea you sang so well. - If you don't mind, may I ask you something? - Yes. What would you do if I wasn't a writer? - What do you mean? - I'm not interested in writing. There's no fun in writing. Take this paper, for example. We print 2000 copies. 200 get sold, the rest is just trash. Who cares about writers? But take singers. - They have a name, are respected. - What are you saying? Writers are better known. A song dies, the singer, too, dies. But literature always lives! And the writer lives with it. Forget about becoming a singer. All right. As you wish. Sing that song for me. - Which one? - The one you were writing. I haven't finished it. I'll recite it tomorrow. All right. When you drink water, your head remains cool. Drinking coffee heats your head. - Shall I get water? - No! We don't want anything! I'm standing there. Call if you need me. You're a good writer. For God's sake, give me a song. You want a poem and I'm stuck on the painting! Ranjit will paint it for you. You paint for him and he'll write a song for me. I'll paint for him and he'll write for you. Your job will be done but who will make me sing? Everybody can cry and sing. I'll show you a way that you can sing! Tell me! Fast! Make her sit in the drawing room and go to the bathroom. Everyone can sing in the bathroom. - What nonsense! - Nonsense? You won't sing. Then his painting won't be done. And I won't get a song. Had it! What, sir! I won't let you die. I'll tell you. You teach him to write. You teach him to sing. You teach him to paint. That means we learn each others' jobs. Yes. How is the idea? Terrific! What an idea! - You're fantastic! - Live long! - When your job is done... - Teach you something! Yes, straight... You can't draw a straight line How will you paint? - Why else are you my teacher? - What a student! You keep drawing straight lines I'll practice my song. Good. Sleeping, crying... Eating, drinking... Kallu, fatso was sleeping. The dog kicked him. And he was crying. Doesn't sound good. Terrible situation! Madam... - Any news of him? - No, madam. I asked all the sign board painters but no sign of him! The writer, he writes. Newspaper, he comes here? Where is he? No idea? Really? - Any news of him? - No. I inquired from big singers but there's no sign of him. God knows where he has gone. Each moment without him is difficult. My veena (musical instrument) weeps in your absence Oh my love, my love, my love My veena weeps in your absence My beloved, to which place have you now gone? I know not the name of that place When this wretched loneliness will end for me, I know not Oh, when are we going to meet again? My love, my love, my love My veena weeps in your absence Without you, my songs are incomplete They are shy to escape my lips I try to play but the strings do not play They just keep suffering in agony Nobody understands my pain My love, my love, my love My veena weeps in your absence It weeps, it weeps With my tears, I have made a portrait of yours My continuous tears have created the destiny of my love With my tears, I have... Taking tears from my eyes, and with a loving gaze... and with blood from my heart, I have drawn out the sketch I have sworn that I will meet you again My continuous tears have created the destiny of my love With my tears, I have... When these beautiful spring nights torture my heart... I will, in my loneliness, talk a little to your portrait A mad lover has now closed herself My continuous tears have created the destiny of my love With my tears, I have made a portrait of yours With my tears, I have... My love, my love My veena weeps in your absence My love, my love, my love There will be no bitterness There will be no complaint or bitterness I have only one small request... that you would be kind enough to listen to me Whether you love me or reject me... I am one of those madly in love with you Even if you do not make me yours... don't think I do not love you I do not have a problem with dying... but I live on with this one hope Maybe my name does figure, even by mistake, in your writings Whether you love me or reject me... I am one of those madly in love with you I am gradually losing myself bit by bit I am burning from within and not just once I have the strength of a flame of fire... but I live among the moths that circle the flame Whether you love me or reject me... I am one of those madly in love with you My love, my love My veena weeps in your absence My love, my love, my love The heart is breaking. Today you could have kept it. Today, even sorrow is fading. You could have at least come today. - Lost something? - Yes. Even I have lost it. Come, looking for something? - Yes. - Sit. We'll search together. Earlier we had nothing. Then we find it and lose everything. The beginning, middle and end. - Then end. - You're worried about your story. I'm worried to death! Can't sleep all night. I've had fits seven times a day! It's when the heroine experiences sorrow, pain is created in the story. - Haven't you seen any films lately? - No. Take any film. When the heroine is in this state... she sings a song. Sad song. Yes. I don't know why, but I, too, sang a painful song this morning. Really? Strange! I sang one, too. - You too? - Yes. - Full of pathos? - Yes. I also sang. Our stories are unfolding well. - Shall I get water? - Water won't do today. The pain is too much. Get coffee. Hot coffee! How many more cups of coffee will you make us drink? We must do something! - If he isn't found... - Don't say that... or I'll get a fit right here. I'm sure you know him. He would come here daily! Yes madam. Black coffee, hot coffee and cold coffee. Where are they? Here is the painter. This is the cold coffee guy. Writer. - And him? - The hot coffee guy? This is him. Singer. He would sing, bang on this table and break them. And these are their bills. Unpaid. They do not owe anyone anything. The world owes them a lot. You don't know how great an artist he is! The gent would recite poems in Hindi and madam does it in English. - You can do one thing. - What? Marry them as soon as they come. Marriage? Those three men have brains and you women have hearts. If you don't keep them tied, they might do anything. They can leave you. They can commit suicide! Arrange for the wedding before they commit suicide. - The idea is good. - Give your consent. My view is the same as the public. The public is supreme in Janata Coffee House. Make arrangements for the weddings. Come on. Father, these are my friends. They've come to meet you. - This is Kalpana and Geeta. - Good day. - Sit down girls. - We haven't come to sit! - We've come to fight! - To fight? - What's my fault? - Serious fault! - Have you seen her face? - Right from her birth. Look carefully. Face is red. Eyes are popping out! Her cheeks are puffing. She's becoming fatter by the day. You are right. I'll call the doctor immediately. He'll give her vitamin shots. Both of you go out. - Vitamins won't work. - Then? Get her married. Good idea. I'll place an advertisement in the paper. There'll be a queue of boys. You don't have to do that. We've found her a groom. - Who is he? - You know him. I know him? Who? - The painter, your tenant. - Painter? He's a good boy! That's why I gave up his six months rent. If I knew my daughter was marrying him, I'd will this house to him. Really? Come on! I've fixed your marriage. Happy? - Are you married? - Not yet. - And you? - No. You're worried about Rekha's wedding, not about your own? Do you know Geeta gets fits day and night. Fans herself all day. And sighs all night. - And you? - I... She goes to his office all day. - Really? - Yes, uncle. Drinks cold coffee all day and darkens paper! Understood. But why don't you get married? - Who will talk to my mother? - I'll talk dear. - And you? - I have neither mother nor father. What am I here for? I'll arrange for your wedding. You all are my daughters. Come on. Mother is inside. - Are you Geeta's mother? - I'm not so lucky. I have no children. I am Geeta's father. What? I'm her mother! I'm Rekha's father not Geeta's. Both are alike for me. Yes, Rekha is an old friend of Geeta's. I'm glad to meet you. Don't stand. Please take a seat. - What can I do for you? - That's what I've come for. - Do you know Geeta? - Won't I know her? - She's my child. - Yet you don't know her. Rekha told me Geeta gets fits. She sighs at nights, cries day and night and fans herself! And you sit and split betel nut! - What can I do? - Marry her off. Right away. I'd like to do that. - Do you know Mohan? - Yes, he lives below. That's the boy for Geeta. They love each other. Get them married. Do you understand? They'll make a good pair. If Geeta married him... I'll listen to hymns every day. He sings very well! I fall asleep every afternoon listening to him. - Done. - Really? Your job is done, yours is done... - Now you're left. - Father, I'm Rekha! I'm fixed. She is left. You're left? Doesn't matter. Now we'll fix yours too. - Who is this? - My elder brother. Elder brother! - Play a game? - Don't you have anything to do but play ball? Turned your house into a field! Think you are a great player! No concern for your sister? She's an adult. Can look after herself. What are you here for? Do you know... - she walks around his office all day! - Good exercise! - Drinks cold coffee. - Keeps the mind cool. - Blackens paper. - Helps pass time. Aren't you worried about her marriage? How can I worry about hers when I don't care about mine? You're her elder brother. You must get her married. She can get married to anyone. Whenever she wishes. I'll host a test match to celebrate her wedding. You organize the match. I'll organize the wedding. There, your job too is done. I'll give an application for your weddings in the court. Will we get married in court? Do people get married or sued in courts? Marriage, compromise, cases, everything is done in courts. Won't there be music at our wedding? I'll have a band playing. Your marriage will be grand. We are crazy birds We have one tune We have one destination We are crazy about love Leaving this earth behind... we have to go beyond the clouds Picking out beautiful stars in the sky... we have to build our own nest We have one focus We have one sense of fun We have the same tales to tell We are crazy birds Now that we have set out together... we will definitely find our destination The heart where we are to make our homes... we will definitely find that heart We crazy people have set out today... to set up a new world for ourselves We are crazy birds We have one tune We have one destination We are crazy about love No, this won't do. Definitely not! We must keep them in the dark. We must tell the truth! If they find out the truth, they won't want to see us again. Lord! You tell us what to do. Let things go on as they are. We'll see after the wedding. But they can leave us after the wedding too. How will they go? We'll hold their legs! - We'll fall at their feet? - Why not? They'll be the legs of our wives, not strangers! We can always hold them. - Won't you feel ashamed? - Why? There was a time when women fell at men's feet. Today man can fall at her feet. May I tell you something? Everyone acts smart outside. But at home all men fall at their wives' feet! - Good day. - Good day son. Sit down. - Good day. - Bless you. - Good day. - Bless you. Who are you? - He's with us. - I see. Come in. Friends, today you are with me in the most happy day of life. I thank you for the same. My only dream in life was to get my daughter married. And today my three daughters, not just one, are getting married! In my eyes Kalpana and Geeta are the same as Rekha. They, too, are my girls. And today under my roof, by my own hands... all three girls will settle down. Where are the girls? Why are you sitting here? You sit there. Are you marrying him or the painter? - He is the painter. - Don't I know him? Come on. Why are you sitting here? Get up. What are you doing father? He's the painter not him. Don't I know the painter? Aren't you the painter? Didn't I excuse your rent? Yes. Yes madam, black coffee. He sits and drinks black coffee. And makes pictures. Mother! - Then who are you? - Writer. Yes madam. Cold coffee. He sits in Janata Coffee House, drinks cold coffee and writes poems! Writes poems? You might as well tell us who you are. I'm a born singer. They have deceived us! - We won't marry them! - Never! Terrible situation! Carbuncles erupted in the heart because of the bruise. The house caught fire by its very own lamp. - Now what will happen? - Where will we go? Good day madams. Hot or cold? We want nothing! - Don't you like hot coffee? - No. Don't you like cold coffee? - Don't you like black coffee? - Not one bit! Then you love the men's work, not them. - You wanted to marry a writer? - Yes. The writer is sitting there. You can marry him. Do you want to marry a painter? The painter is sitting there. - You may marry him. - Scoot! - You want the singer? - Yes. There he is. Marry him. You love neither the men nor their professions. I'm telling you ladies, forget your heads. Follow your heart. Forget the professions. Marry your loved ones or you'll live to regret it. What he says is right. A singer can be as good as an artist or a writer. Then a writer can't be worse than a painter. A painter isn't worse than a singer. Now there's nothing to worry about! The ladies will pay the bills of these gentlemen! Quiet! The three girls left the Janata Coffee House and entered their homes. This was a victory of the heart over the brain. For the first time woman realized you love by your heart. Before, what she considered to be love was a deception. Subterfuge! Mental illusion! Excellent! Sir, you are absolutely right. You're not the only one to say this. Even Saint Kabir said this... What runs is a vehicle. Boiled milk is condensed. That which is colored is called an orange. Thus cried Kabira!
