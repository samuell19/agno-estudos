What game are you playing? Give Mom a call. Hello? Web! Looking for Syndra? Tyler! Do as I say and nobody gets hurt. Where's my sister? Don't call the cops or I can't guarantee what will happen next. It's not something you want to see. Tyler! Tyler! -Let go of me! -Get in! Let me out, jerk! Let me out! Open the door! Let me out! Let me out! Hey! Tyler! She's your girlfriend, what do you want? A smart guy like you should know what to do. Tyler Lee, I swear if you lay a finger on her I'll break your damn legs. Web! What happened? Nothing. Mom, I'm going to find Syndra. Don't worry. Fresh oranges… Hello? Welcome to Seoul. -Where's my sister? -Calm down! She'll be fine if you do as I say. Look across the street. Follow them. What game are you playing? Don't lose them. Cut the crap and let her go. You must join a competition. Tyler, you jerk! What competition? Tyler! You're with Tyler? You know Tyler? Then you must know we're UG. Where is he? You have a lot of nerve starting trouble over here. Find him yourself! Wait! Have you seen a girl called Syndra? They announced the venue of the competition! Let's go take a look! Are you crazy? Sorry! Lunatic! Someone beat us here. Awesome! Syndra? Fee, that's cheating. You were hiding in here. You were too slow. How did you get in here? You have no right to ask me. He's so cocky! Welcome to the 2013 Urban Games. I'd like to present this year's UG girl Maja! She's pretty! Let's all take a good look… at the contestants. This is a game for the brave, who are up for a challenge and not afraid of hardship. We have prepared for the winner an award of $100,000 USD. Tyler Lee! Come out here, jerk! Where's my sister? Everyone… Do you know him? He's Web Zhang. The biggest name in the UG Hall of Fame Teddy Zhang's brother. Teddy Zhang's brother is a UG celebrity. Yes, the Teddy Zhang, who invented that daring dive. Because of him UG is what it is today. Urban Games Cut the crap! -Let my sister go! -Web. Watch out -or I'll… -Web! Remember what I told you. Or else… Listen up, everyone. You know the rules The game is about to begin. Watch you phones. Get started once you get the message. Hey, buddy! There'll be UG activities want to join in? We'll see. Listen… to save Syndra, do as Tyler say. That's mine. JJ? Web! What are you doing here? I work here. You're with Tyler? He kidnapped my sister. Are you with him? Kidnap? What kidnap? Tyler? No way! You didn't know he kidnapped my sister? Web. I just work here. Where is he? Why did he make me join this competition? I really don't know. I haven't seen Tyler in a long time. He's not the same anymore. JJ! I need your help to find him. I must save Syndra. No… You don't know what you're up against. Don't mess with them. Trust me. Tell him I won't let him off the hook. You seem upset, buddy. What's with this competition? You don't know? Beanie, tell him the rules. Tyler and Maja pick the contestants for each round. After 3 rounds, we have 4 finalists. The winner takes home the prize money and gets Maja. Get it? You want in? The competition I'm in, as long as I can find Tyler. You know him well? Not at all. Ask Fee to find out. She came with Tyler. She wasn't one of us. What does she do? Hard to say. She has a bookstore nearby. How about a game? Snooker? You go ahead. Hey! What are you looking for, Web? I don't know what you mean. You haven't been listening. Don't tell me you're taking a walk. You put me under surveillance? Let me talk to my sister, or I won't sign up for the compeition. Fine! I'll let you talk to Syndra. But you must finish the competition before I can guarantee her safety. Or else even I can't help you. Syndra, guess who's here. Who are you? Let me out! Syndra, it's me. Web? Web? Is that you? Where are you? Can you hear me? Are you alright? Are you hurt? No, Web. Get me out. Do you know Tyler is behind this? Web! Web! Syndra! Syndra! Tyler! Happy now? Syndra's safety depends on you. If you win, you'll get her back. Tyler Lee! If my sister so much as loses a hair, I will… If you listened to me in the first place none of this would have happened. There's no turning back for us. You must finish the competition. Do we have a deal? I'll do it on one condition. No harm must come to my sister. Welcome back, Web. You will turn UG into a frenzy. It's alright, Grandpa. I'll do it. What are you doing here? Just browsing. Let me help you. Don't worry. I'll do it. You can go. Long time no see. Long time no see. Coke. Look who's here. Are you ready? Why wouldn't I be? The exciting moment is upon us. Allow me to introduce the Ninja Warriors of the first round. The rules are simple. The minute the contestants jump down, we don't care how they do it, the first person to go through the UG obstacle and lands on top of the container is the winner. He can claim the prize money of $10,000 USD and enter the next round. Maja, over to you. Lancelot! He's likely to win, because he's a brilliant rock climber. Red! She's trained in Brazilian Jiu-jitsu and she's quite good. How does she know who to pick? She seems to be taking orders from someone. -Yes! -UG is hot, people want to make money from it, and bets are being made. It's likely Maja is working for some big shot who controls the competition. The stakes are high. T-Devil! This bastard plays dirty. He gets on my nerves. Randy, David, Beanie! Come on down! Yes, all UG experts! Fee! Everyone seems to like her! And finally… that's right, Web Zhang. You won't be disappointed. The PK between experts gets no blessings from God. A tough rival does not mean fear. Who will be the champ? Red? David? Lancelot? Web? T-Devil? Or your favorite Fee? Root for the champ of your choice. Anything is possible! 3… 2… 1… The contestants started almost simultaneously! It's hard to say who has the lead. Everyone has jumped over the first wall, and showing their colors to overcome the second. Red and Fee are tangled up. Web took a kick on the climbing wall. The heat is on… and competition is exceptionally cruel. Beanie is out! You're quick! Red is down! All is lost if you're not careful, and the champion title is gone forever. You think this is cruel? No, if you persist, the UG world can unmask its icy veil for you. Serve you right! There's no such thing as luck, only the battle of strenghts. Watch out! Hang on! Web saved the damsel in distress! Our shoo-in threw in the towel at the last minute. No man can resist a pretty lady indeed. T Devil and David both have a definite edge. They are both inside the UG obstacle. Who will be the winner? Winner of Round 1 is… David! Is he the dark horse? The competition has just begun. Let's wait and see. T Devil, you're no match for me. Just wait, David. Brilliant, David! That was perfect! Cheers, Web! My hat's off to you! You saved Fee because you want to hit on her? Fee! Can I have a word? Are you alright? I didn't expect you to be so heavy, you almost pulled off my arm! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to! I don't think you came here to thank me. No. I have something to show you. I just found out they've been watching you. Who are they? Tyler! Why him? They look like henchmen. You said Tyler kidnapped your sister. Why did he do it? Who knows? It's crazy! Probably for money! UG… is not the same anymore. It's all about money now. Tyler kidnapped my sister, and forced me to compete. I guess he did it to attract more attention so they can make more money. If the winner gets a huge reward, that means UG will make a lot more. If so much money is involved, is it possible someone else is behind Tyler? Who else? My friend is an accountant. I can ask him to find out about UG's structure. Good! Thanks! You need not have bothered. At the competition today, you need not have bothered either. Syndra! Syndra! My dear… Don't forget what the Boss said. I looked into UG. The company's investment portfolio seems to be in order. 20 employees, an annual profit of $6m and enjoying steady growth. But a few months ago, an investment company called Bandes took control of it. And here's the problem. I can't find anything on them. What does that mean? Look… Most financial reports and any information on management are usually shown here. But Bandes left this blank. I suspect they have something to hide. You're saying it's a shell company? I think so. Young man, whatever is your connection to Bandes, I don't care. Just leave her out of it. OK? Thank you, Uncle Meng. A relative? No. He was my Dad's best friend. What's your plan? I must save my sister, no matter what. I will continue to compete. I'm tired of waiting. Whateve will come, will come. David, are you ready to let me beat you. I think I beat you last time. Hello, everyone! We meet again! Are you ready for Round 2? Ladies and gentlement and fellow contestants, allow me to present the Dive of Death. The PK between experts is romantic and fearful, real and dreamy. The Platform of Death is this 80m tall cooling tower. It is divided into 4 levels. The gap between each level is 20m. At the bottom is a high speed centrifuge, powerful enough to turn over a truck. The successful diver can take home $50,000 USD and qualify for the next round for the $100,000 final. Let's get a feel of the thrill and danger, the real UG. Urban Games Bloody Awesome! Let's go! We have 6 contestants. This is the most exciting and nerve wrecking competition. The fate of the diver lies is that deadly jump. This is the testimony to UG's unyielding spirit. At this moment, it is more than a competition, it is also a battle of the body and soul. UG means the will power to win. Ready… Damn! That jump doesn't look good! I bet it hurts. He has obviously forgotten about gravity. David remains the dark horse. Fee is on Level 4, taking on the challenge from the highest point. What fate will await her? Defeat or glory? A new dark horse is born! Fee is the champion! Awesome! Fee overcame her own limit. This is what UG is all about! Hold on…we have forgotten someone. Web! Where is he? Bring him in! But where? Where is Web? Did he go home? Where is he? Where is Web? He's at the top of the tower. Web! The jump tomorrow is tailor made for you. You lost Round 1, don't let us down again. You know what to do. Have you decided, Web? Isn't this what you want? I want to see you in the final. This is suicide, you won't make it. Anything is possible! You'll see! Very well. Let us give this daring lunatic a great big cheer! Web Zhang! Go for it! Urban Games Bloody Awesome! You're awake? Can I join you? Can you dance? Teach me. Morning! Morning! When you jumped I was really scared. I haven't been this scared in a long time. I remember last night there was nice music, the lights and you. Does it still hurt? To be able to dance was once my biggest dream. Why did you give it up? I stopped dancing when my parents died. I only dance for those I love. Sorry! It's OK! That was a long time ago. After they died, they left the bookstore to me and Grandpa. Grandpa is getting on in years and business is bad. If this keeps up, the bookstore will close down eventually. That's why you want to win? I'm surprised you're quite smart! But you won the Dive of Death. Me? Don't you remember? When you jumped we all thought you'd be dead for sure. But you were the closest to the ground. You qualified for the next round. I had no choice. This is the only way to save my sister. You can do it. I think I want to dance again. Bye! What are you doing? -Out of the way… -What? Stop! Don't move! Where did he go? -Damn! -Shit! Listen to me, Web. It's not what you think Or what I have imagined. You kidnapped Syndra. Someday you'll understand. Web… the last round you must… Tyler! You're too smart to do something stupid. Hello? Hello? After you finish everything Syndra, Web and you are free to go. Finish the game properly, do what you have to. Tyler! Say something! Web! We have eyes on you. You better finish the competition. Tyler, you jerk! I'm helping you. You better keep your promise. You don't even know who you're up against. Are you alright? See you at the finishing line. You'll win for sure! David, don't celebrate too early! On your marks! You have 8 minutes. The first person to reach the finishing line wins. You're free to choose your own route, do whatever it takes. The viewers want something explosive. Have a nice ride! Go! 4 contestants chose the shortest route, but both routes are bumpy. Will they reach the city in time? Brilliant! That only took 90 seconds. Both contestants reached the city almost simultaneously. Don't hesitate, place your bets and win the big prize. Oh no! Fee is down! She's currently the favorite to win. David is trapped as well. But Fee turned things around! That's what's so brilliant about life! T Devil's fall is tragic! What now? Fee! David! David! -Are you alright? -David! David! This baby came in handy. I'm fine. Who would take a shot at us? Looks like someone doesn't want you to win. Syndra! So much for you prize money! I've been watching you, smart guy! How dare you bet against the Boss! You think you can fool him? I've been monitoring your computer. Moron! My dear… why don't you ever listen? Jerk! Here's a memento for you. Goodbye, buddy! I'll get back at you. -Syndra! -Web, be careful! They're armed. Tyler, let my sister go! JJ? It's you!? Surprised? Of course.. in your eyes… I'm just another nobody and I shouldn't be here. I'm sorry to let you down. Let my sister go! You think I'm a moron? Why would I let my hostage go? Why did you do it? Need you even ask? All these years, what have I got? Nothing! You're the same. You hogged the limelight, who cares about me? Well? How does it feel to be manipulated? JJ, we never asked for anything. We always treated you like our brother. Bullshit! I was never your brother. No? You have no right to give me orders. Freeze! Drop your weapons! Drop it! Get down! This way! Hurry… Come in! Blood! Be careful! You must have questions for me. Did you kidnap Syndra? Of course not! If I don't do as they say, Syndra will get hurt. Jerk! You knew they kidnapped me but you still worked for them. I'm sorry, Syndra. You have no idea what they're capable of! I had no choice. But Web, I'm on your side. I bet heavily on you. I wanted to make a lot of money. You did it for yourself! Don't listen to him! Why else am I here? Syndra! I have always loved you. I will prove it to you. Tyler! You're under arrest! You're a cop? That's right! We're onto them for a long time. Take him away. JJ and Maja got away. They couldn't have gone very far. I wanted to use this to find Tyler, now this should come in handy. In order to repay you I have a present for you. Web, JJ and Maja have been arrested. But UG is still running. The mastermind behind will surface soon. I need your help. Can you hear me, Web? Audio and visual are clear. Wind speed normal. Teddy, we missed you. Don't worry, we're fine. Web, Teddy would have been so proud of you. Teddy, let's root for Web. He'll make your wish come true today. I know you can do it. I'll be with you the whole time.
