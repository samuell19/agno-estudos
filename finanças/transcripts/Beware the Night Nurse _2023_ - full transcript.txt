Stop! Please, no. Stop! He's not yours. Don't hurt him. Give him back, please. No. Please, don't hurt him. Yes, we're home. Yes, you're such a good boy. Hi. Hi, yes. Yes. Hi, baby Owen. That's your daddy, Zach. That's your daddy right there. That's your daddy right there. Yes. - All right. - Yes. Hi. Yes. All right. We've wanted this for so long. This is the first time we're gonna step It almost doesn't feel real. Come on. Let's go see your room. Look at your room, baby Owen. Oh my goodness. Look at the nice elephants and the llama. Your daddy was so excited to get it all ready for you. Yes, he was. So much. - I love you, too. - Oh, we love you. Yes, we do. I fed him, rocked him and sang to him. I feel like I haven't slept in a week. That's because we haven't. I'll try. No, let's see if he'll go down. There's nothing more we can do right now. I've been like a zombie at work. Yeah. Liz. - Hi. - Hey, Claire. He's napping right now, but come in. First I wanna show you something. I meant to give you yours last week. Thank you. That was a really nice time. It was. But this summer with you nearly ready to burst? It was so special. I don't mean it in a bad way, but you look tired. Oh my gosh. I am. Owen will still not sleep through the night. No matter. Owen is a perfect baby. No one has ever done anything so kind for me before. Oh, it hardly compares. You didn't need my help to become a paralegal. And you could totally go to law school if you put your mind to it. It's not just that. It was the getting the charge dropped. I did need your help. I mean, I was just... A little lost. I know. You wanna go see Owen now? Yes, please. He'll sleep occasionally through the day, and he's up all night, every night. It'll get better. I think. He's gonna have a good life with you and Zach as parents. No. Definitely not. It's not fair that someone like my mom gets to have a kid when all she did was tear me down and make me insecure. And then there's people like you and Zach who will be perfect parents, and you couldn't have kids of your own. I can't tell you how grateful we are for what you did for us. It's funny. All my mom ever wanted was a boy, and she had me. She couldn't have any more kids after that. And then here's Owen, a boy. He's smiling in his sleep. Here. - Oh, wow. - More trial prep today? Yeah. Actually, I wanted to talk to you. What do you think about hiring a night nurse? If we do that, what am I taking maternity leave for? You'd still be with Owen all day and we'd be able to sleep. I don't even know if it's safe for you to be this tired. All right? Think about it. Please. Hi, this is Liz. Leave a message. Hi, Liz. It's Claire. I thought you were coming by today, but just let me know if something came up, okay? Shh. Yeah, hi. Yeah. Hi. Liz? Sorry... Liz? Hi, this is Liz. Leave a message. It's okay, honey. It's okay, honey. Okay, okay, okay. Claire, what are you doing here? Why aren't you picking up my phone calls? You have to go. You and Owen can't be here. - What's wrong? - Just please go. - Did something happen? - I mean it, Claire. Get outta here. No, I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on. Liz, take a deep breath and tell me what's wrong. Wait, was there anyone outside when you came in? What? No. - No! - Okay, well, I'm leaving. What? This is crazy. Do you want me to call the police? I've tried that already. They're not gonna do anything. Okay, just don't come back here and don't look for me. I need to protect you and I need to protect Owen. Liz! Where are you going? Stop! Liz! Liz! She said Owen and I were in danger, Zach. Well, she said she needed to protect us and that we shouldn't look for her. It was the same thing. But she never said danger, though. She was terrified of something. It was like she'd seen a ghost. You said that she looked at Owen weird. Do you think it could be hard for her to see him? I asked her last week if she regretted being our surrogate and she said no. There was no getting through to her. I tried everything. What? What could we say to them that they could do something about? We don't really know anything. You're right. But I'm scared, Zach. I know, honey. I've been trying all afternoon, but I'll call again. We're, sorry. Your call cannot be completed as dialed. Come here. Okay. Come on, come on. It's all right. It's okay, baby. It's okay. Let me know if you hear from Liz, all right? I'll see you later tonight, okay? I will. Have a good day, okay? - You, too. - Okay. Excuse me. Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell? Yes? Do you know a woman named Elizabeth Chenoweth? What makes you think something happened? My wife was speaking to her yesterday. Apparently she was a little distraught. What was your relationship to Ms. Chenoweth. Was? She's a paralegal at our law firm and the surrogate mother to our son. We discovered a large amount of calls from your number to Ms. Chenoweth on her cell, Ms. Mitchell. Care to explain why? Why do you have her phone? Like Zach said, I saw Liz yesterday afternoon. She was supposed to come over and visit, so I went to her apartment to check on her. She was completely out of it. She left somewhere in a hurry, I don't know where, and I was worried about her, so I kept trying to reach her. Now, can you please tell us what happened? I'm sorry, but we found Ms. Chenoweth's car abandoned in the woods next to a quarry that's used for suicides in the past. We believe that she took her own life late last night No. That can't be. Oh my god. - I... - It can't be that. I should have done something. - I should have stopped her. - No, no, no, no. No, no. No. You cannot think like that. This isn't your fault. Let's just make it through today, okay? I got him, okay? Come on, bud. We can't take him over there if he won't stop crying, Zach. No. Oh, I feel like I'm going crazy, Zach. It's just sleep deprivation, hon. No, it's not just that. We talked about this. You can't blame yourself. Obviously Liz was more tortured than we knew. - Hello? - Hi. You knew Liz? I'm Vera. I was Liz's nanny when she was little. I was walking over when I heard your baby crying. I'm Zach, and this is Claire, and that's Owen with the set of pipes. I'll say. Would you like me to try? Crying babies is sort of my world of expertise. Oh, that's all right. I see I've overstepped. No, if you think you can help. Yeah. Go ahead. You sure? Oh. You do this professionally? For 30 years. But I don't have to if you don't want me to. No, go ahead. Come here, little man. That's right, yeah. Owen. Hi, little man. - Oh, you're so cute. - That's amazing. This is the first time he stopped crying in weeks. - Yeah. - Thank you. It's a gift. I adore children. You said you do this professionally? Are you available? I mean, are you currently free to work for us? I just finished with another client, so I am free. Well, do you have someone we could call? A reference? I can give you the number of the last family I worked for. Please, don't take another job Okay. All right. Should we walk over? I can hold Owen while you two pay your respects. That'd be amazing. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Okay, let's go. - Yeah. Honey, we haven't had a full night's sleep or a moment of silence in weeks. You see how she was with Owen today. I still wanna call her reference. Call 'em. If she's anything like she was today, my guess is they're glowing. Honey, this doesn't say anything bad about you. But we have to sleep. My trial's coming up and I need to be 100% prepared. You said it yourself. We're going crazy. - Okay. - Okay? I'll call the number she gave us. Hey. You're gonna get a nanny. Yeah. Hello? I'm calling in reference to your previous night nurse, Vera. Oh, Vera. Oh, she's absolutely wonderful. I'm telling you, when she appeared at our church's annual bake off, I thought God himself had sent her. I just wanted to make sure she's someone I can trust. Oh, I understand completely. Finding someone you feel good about of the hardest things in the world. But yeah, you can rest assured with Vera. She is excellent. Our daughter sleeps perfectly now. Okay. Thanks for taking the time. I'm looking forward to working with Vera. Absolutely. Oh, please tell her I said hello. Yeah? You think so? I do. Hey, it's gonna be good. - All right? - Okay. You better be right. I? m always right. Everything you need is here and formula's in the pantry. Oh, you don't pump? Oh, you couldn't conceive. No. That's very hard. May I? Oh, yes, please. Go ahead. Oh, look at you. Oh, mm. Does that ever make you feel less than? Oh, it would be completely natural if it did, No, I look at you and I can see how much you care for Owen, how important he is to you. Hmm. Every mother worries they're not doing a good enough job, but no one's good at anything right away, right? You're right. Yes, we are. A proper heir. We'd have been just as happy with a little girl. Really? Of course. Huh. Well, you should get some sleep. Yes, Zach and I are right through there. If there's any issues, don't hesitate to wake us up. The whole point is for you to get a good night's sleep. The little man and I will be just fine. Okay, but if you have any problem... Claire. Don't worry, please. - I promise. - Okay. Good night, baby Owen. Good night, Claire. What time is it? - It's eight. - It's eight? Are you sure you don't want any breakfast? I put extra love in it this morning. No, I'm good, but it looks delicious. Oh, you know the formula you have? It's not my favorite. I'll text you the name of the brand that I like. Okay. Zach and I haven't slept through the night in weeks. Oh, Owen just needed his nana Vera, I guess. Maybe tonight you can show me what you do. You know, teach me your secrets. - I'd love to. - Okay. All right, I'm off. I'll see you tonight. My goodness. Oh, I hadn't seen Liz in years. Yes, she was. Hm. It's funny, Liz never mentioned she had a nanny. In fact, she always sort of implied she had a pretty difficult upbringing. Hm. I'm sorry, I didn't mean anything by that. - That was rude. - No, no, no, no. Liz never talked about her past much, honestly. She wouldn't, no. It was, uh, difficult. She was difficult. But that's a story for another day. Okay. So I'll see you tonight, Claire. - See you then. - Okay. - Thanks again, Vera. - Oh, of course. Yes. So you're glad we hired her? - Thank you. - You look so beautiful. Thank you. - I love you so, so much. - I love you, too. How's Owen? Perfectly. - Nothing. - You hear it? Nothing. For sleeping through the night, Owen. You let mommy and daddy sleep finally. Yes. We're so proud of you. Yes, yes. He's such a good boy. Mommy will be right back, okay? Okay? Mommy will be right back. Claire. Hi. Grab that, would you? Hm. This place could use a clean, but I'll get to that later. Where's my grandson? Zach didn't tell me you were coming. Well, that's because he didn't know. I wanted to surprise you both If you thought I was waiting until Christmas to meet my grandson, well, you both had another thing coming. You know where to find me. Hey. You're perfect. Just beautiful. You look just like your daddy when he was a baby. I've waited 30 years for this. You get to hold him all the time. It's my very first time, and I'm never gonna let him go. No, he's my little honey bunny. Yes he is. Come in. I think you might want to make this less public. What? I know in the end, you had to use a surrogate, but you might not want to announce it to every single guest that enters your home. I'll make Zach's favorite, carbonara. Dinner is served. No. It's not that hard. Thanks for cleaning. Mm. Judy, how long are you gonna be staying? Oh, I don't know. I didn't book a return flight. Two weeks, anyway. You know when your baby has a baby, you show up. - Right? - Come on, mom. Excuse me for a moment. Aren't you gonna eat all your food? I made your favorite. Claire, hon, everything okay? You all right? Yeah. Just a little overwhelmed is all. How come? We have a lot going on right now, Zach. I don't know that your mom being our house guest for the next two weeks is the best idea. I mean, I think she'll be a big help, don't you? She already cleaned the house and made dinner. She could help with Owen. I love how much she loves you. But? She's just trying to help. Today she took the picture of me and Liz out of the living room because she thought it'd send the wrong message to guests. Do you know how hurtful that is? Look, I'll talk to her, okay? But this is a good thing. You'll see. Yes, can I help you? It's okay, mom. Nanny? Hi, Vera. Hello. Yeah, hi. I'll see to Owen. Thanks, Vera. I'll be right there. So at what point were you thinking that it was okay to have some stranger looking after my grandson? She comes at night. It helps us sleep. It'll help you sleep, too. I can stay up with Owen. Tell her to take the next two weeks off, and if you think you still want her, then we'll... This isn't your decision to make. I... Claire's right, mom. You'll have all day, every day with Owen. Vera's been great. I really think you'll like her. But if you think that's what's best. Yeah. It is. You drift off so fast. Hi, Vera. I'm so sorry about that. Oh. An overbearing woman, it seems. Yeah, I met Liz initially right out of law school. And she'd been caught shoplifting. My goodness. Well, Liz was very troubled. Yeah, when I met her, I could tell she was a young woman having a hard time. Yes, but stealing? What a frivolous thing to take. She was charged? Mm-hm. But I got her off and the charges expunged. Really? I suppose so. You know, Liz was always getting into trouble as a child. And no respect for authority. She gave her mother a very hard time. And you too, then, I guess. Well thankfully people grow up. Anyway, after the charges were dropped, I got her into some classes to become a paralegal, and when I moved over to the private sector, I made sure she was offered a position at the firm. That was kind of you. Can I? Oh, yes, of course. Hi. How did she come to be your surrogate? Well, Zach and I tried for a year before we went to the doctor, and then I learned I was never gonna be able Liz and I had a lunch on the books, one of these regular catch ups we do, and I almost canceled, but in the end, I decided to go. And thank God I did. Well, at lunch I broke down crying. Liz asked me what was wrong, and I don't know what came over me, but I spilled my guts. I told her everything. She was very comforting. And I didn't think anything more of it, but the next day she came into my office and told me she'd be our surrogate if we wanted. Goodness. Can you imagine growing a baby inside of you for nine months and then handing him off to someone else? I don't think I could ever be so selfless. I did. That was taken at our cottage this summer. I took the last month off with Liz and we lived up there. It was such a genuinely happy time. Where's your cottage? Gravenhurst, just north of the city. Oh. That sounds lovely. Thank you for being here, Vera. We're lucky to have you. I wouldn't dream of being anywhere else. Oh, he's out cold. I mean that. Oh, that face. Good morning. You're leaving? I got it. Well, he really can be quite fussy. Really, you're no longer needed here. Well, you're making it too hot. Are you kidding? - Give me... - Stop. What is going on? You two are fighting like children. This is ridiculous. Please tell her we don't need her here anymore. Judy, we talked about this. Vera being here isn't up to you. I'm not comfortable with her being around Owen. - Hm. - Stop it, both of you. I did. Okay, Judy, you feed Owen. - Vera, I'll walk you out. - There's no need. I can see my self out. You see? That woman is unhinged. You can't trust a stranger with your baby, Claire. I told you. We need to report this to the police. Judy. Let it be. They were fighting over the bottle like two year olds. Vera tried to take it from my mom. Your mom was egging her on. I think my mom was a little suspicious of a stranger. That's all. I think it's jealousy. Obviously cares a lot about Owen. Your mom doesn't like competing with someone else to be queen of the castle. I think that's what's going on. That's harsh. Before things escalate. Yes, both, together. Make it clear that the incident that happened this morning doesn't happen again. And whatever either of them says, we stay unified. Same page. Okay? Yeah. Same page. Got it. - Are you mad? - No, I just... I didn't think on the second day of my mom's visit I'd be sitting her down for her talking to. It's not the most comfortable conversation in the world, Claire. I get that. But we need to address this. Now? Claire told me about this morning. Did she tell you that this woman... Mom, please. Just give us a second here, okay? Look, what happened this morning isn't worth retreading, but we don't want any conflict around our son, especially when it's completely unnecessary. You can both help take care of Owen. Do you both understand? That's the most important thing, isn't it? Can't we at least come together on that? She's not family. Ugh. You're mad that my bond with Owen is stronger than yours. - Oh, please. - It's written all over your fa... Enough. This is exactly what I'm talking about. Anymore of this, and Judy, we'll have to ask you to leave. And Vera, we'll have to let you go. Can you say you're sorry so we can move on? Come on, mom. Vera, how about you? Sorry. There. Well, I'll put Owen down. How about I make a fresh pot of tea for everyone? If that's okay? Lovely. Come here, little man. - Thank you. - Mm-hm. - Here we go. - Thank you. Mm. Mm-mm-mm. A stranger with your baby. Mom. That's all I've got to say. I wanted to make you a pot of my special tea. It's really quite delightful. A sort of apology, if you will. That's very nice. You're not having any? But right now, I'm gonna get back to Owen, so, sleep well. Zach, don't. What? It is really good. Just smells a little too sweet for me right now. Really? - Mm. - Hm, I like it. Oh, you're drinking that fast. Yeah, it's too sweet for me. Look, I know it was important out there that we present a unified front, I get that, but I do think my mom's right. She's family, Vera's not. What? Claire, no, that's not what I mean. That's why we just talked to them both. What I'm saying is that my mom's Vera could quit tomorrow for all we know. - No, she wouldn't do that. - You're ignoring my point. Yeah? Look, my mom can be a really big help if you let her. She just wants to feel important and appreciated. Give her that and she'll be an angel. Okay? You can't trust a stranger with your baby. Trust a stranger with your baby... Baby... Don't come back here and don't look for me. I'm serious. We need to report this to the police. Judy. Don't come back here and don't look for me. I need to protect you and I need to protect Owen. Liz, Liz... Li... You can't trust a stranger with your baby, Claire. Vera? Vera? Owen? Vera? Vera! Vera? Vera, what are you doing? What are you doing? Open up! Open... Vera, what are you doing? Owen couldn't sleep so I took him for a short car ride. It helps lull him to bed. Vera, you can't just take him. Vera, you can't just take him. Don't get upset! This is totally normal! Your car? Why would you do that? Claire, give the little man to me. I'll put him down and then we can talk. You're distraught. I think you need to leave. Owen is scared, Claire. Stop. Ow! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. You need to leave or I'll call the police. All right, I'm leaving. I'm leaving. We can talk about this tomorrow. This is all a big misunderstanding. - You need to leave now. - I heard you, I heard you. Are you two okay? It's fine. And meet me in the kitchen. It's okay. I'm sorry. Mommy didn't mean to scare you. I'm so sorry. Judy, it's fine. Really. I told you this would happen. Maybe I overreacted. But I panicked when I couldn't find Owen. She took him from his house without asking. There's no second chances on something like this. Are you seriously considering letting her back in this house? You have to fire her. If you'd only listened to me in the first place, There's nothing we can do tonight, anyway. Well, I'm sleeping in Owen's room. But thanks. Go back to bed. [first aid kit clicking[ It was an accident. Vera was reaching for Owen and I spun away. That's not what my mom said. I know. I'm gonna call her right now. I was knocked out. I can't believe I didn't wake up. Yeah, you're not a heavy sleeper. I realize that I was the one that pushed to hire her. I'm fine if you wanna let her go. No. No, your mom got in my head about trusting Vera and I panicked, that's all. This whole thing got blown way out of proportion. But what if my mom is right? Your mom is sticking her nose in every part of our lives. It's overwhelming and it's throwing me off. This is about whether we can trust Vera. I wanna talk to her and decide for myself, without your mom harping in my ear. She's great with Owen. Over what could just be a simple misunderstanding. If that's what you think is best. You can't take Owen without talking to me first ever again, okay Vera? And a car ride is a great way to lull a baby to sleep. We're not talking about whether or not I was just doing what I thought was necessary I didn't think it would be a problem. It was a problem. You scratched me, Vera. Claire, I feel very close to Owen. You are upset, he was frightened. Of course I was upset. You understand that you crossed a line last night, right? I would never, ever let anything happen to Owen. I'm not sure you're hearing me right now. I'm talking about how what you did was inappropriate. I don't think you understand me, Claire. If I thought for a second that anything - was gonna happen to him... - What do you mean bonded? Well he spends every night in my arms. He's my little man. I thought I'd call and you'd apologize and that would be it, but it doesn't feel like we're on the same page at all here. You're making me really uncomfortable, Vera. Maybe we should just take a little break. And I'll call you in a couple of days, all right? No, no, I don't think that's a very good idea, Claire. I'm telling you not to come in tonight. Is that clear, Vera? Are you there? Vera? I told her not to come in for a couple of days. - Couple of days? - Yeah, a couple of days. A step in the right direction, I suppose. I'm glad you approve, Judy. Vera? What are you doing here? Hello, Claire. I told you not to come tonight. And I told you Owen needs me. Everything's locked. I had a key made. From the spare. I thought it would be more helpful. Did you tell her it's okay to make a key? No! I thought I heard yelling. You! That's it, I'm calling the police. You should probably leave, Vera. Just give Owen to me, Claire. Come on. What's wrong with you?! I just want what's best for Owen. That is all. You need to leave right now. Whatever you do, I will always be a part of Owen's life. - Did you hear me? - Let's go. Sleep well tonight thinking about that. Walk. Get outta my house. Oh, I'm sorry, baby Owen. I'm sorry. Shh. Mommy didn't mean to scare you. Oh. Mommy didn't mean to scare you, okay? And you say you never provided her with a spare key? No, definitely not. She had it made without us knowing. But she did work for you? Tonight? It seemed like an accident at the time. Vera Ivanov. You got an address? You don't know where she lives? No. Bank account info? She wanted to be paid in cash. License plate? All right. Did you find out anything about her before she started? She was our surrogate's nanny growing up, so we trusted her. I didn't. What's her name? Liz Chenoweth, but she died recently. Vera gave us a reference and I called them before we hired her. Maybe they know where she lives? You're right. Maybe. She was the reference. I'll see what we can do with this, so I wouldn't hold out much hope. Besides that, you should change your locks and call us immediately if she comes by again. Aren't you going to do something? There's not much we can do, ma'am. She didn't take anything. She didn't break in, technically. You don't know anything about her other than her name. And with this fake reference thing, I'm guessing that's not even real. I'm sorry... Try and be a little more careful about who you hire in the future. This is the last of your locks changed out. There's your new key. - Perfect. - Great. She was our surrogate's nanny growing up, so we trusted her. All my mom ever wanted was a boy. She had me. She couldn't have any more kids after that. A boy. You said you were her nanny? It's funny, Liz never mentioned she had a nanny. In fact, she always sort of implied she had a pretty difficult upbringing. Vera is Liz's mom. His biological grandmother. That's why she's so obsessed. Yes, but it's 100% not true. I think that's why she killed Liz and stalked us. I have an idea. Do you think it'll work? I hope so. Mm. Hey. Oh, what I wouldn't give to see her face. Of course I wouldn't let you and Owen come up here by yourselves. Got him? - Got it. - Great. Thank you. This time you're going away. Owen's gone and you'll never see him again. Claire. She'll be arraigned first thing. Okay. Good. I'm in court tomorrow, but just call my cell if anything comes up. I will. The surveillance footage will help. That was my wife's idea. Smart. It was. I should have explained. I just... That day you came to my apartment was the first time I had seen my mom in years. I thought I'd gotten away, but she tracked me down. She left right before you got there. You have no idea what she's capable of. - Oh, we do, actually. - Boy, do we. I should have told you. The only thing on my mind was run. It was like I was 16 again, back to the worst time in my life. What did she do to you, Liz? I don't know. The last time I saw her was after I tried to wear a dress She caught me and locked me in my room for nine days. She'd put a little bit of food and tea inside. First I drank it cause I was so thirsty. But she put something in the tea. Zach. Oh. I couldn't trust anything after that. So I just stopped drinking, stopped eating. Oh, Liz. I pleaded with her to let me out. I swore I'd be good. I ran away as soon as I could after that. All because you wore a dress? She wanted a boy and she had me, so she just treated me like a boy, anyway. If I tried to do anything girly, she'd punish me. That dress was the final straw after a lot of other stuff. What was her fixation on a boy? It's how her parents raised her. Heir to the family name, that sort of thing. In her family, her brothers were everything and she was nothing. She never got any approval. Never any love. You'd hope she'd think differently because of that, right? So that's why she was so obsessed with Owen. Exactly. I thought maybe she didn't know about him and if I left right away, she wouldn't even find out. I remembered the cottage, so I came up here. So I abandoned it up on the road by the quarry. Thanks. I never knew things were that bad for you growing up. That's awful. Oh. Zach? It worked, hon. She's in jail. Oh, thank God. Are you okay, Zach? I'm just glad it's over. Me, too. I love you. Us too. Thanks. I'm driving up right after court. I'll be there just after lunch. Can't wait. Good night, honey. Finally. I hope they lock her under the prison. Any of this was gonna happen, I... Hey, Liz. It's okay. Yes. Wow, look at that fire. Are you excited daddy's coming tomorrow? Are you as excited as I am? Yeah? Yeah? Did you have fun with your grandma Judy today? Yeah? Did you have fun? Oh, you like the fire, huh? Yes, it's so nice. I know, it's so nice and cozy in here. He's good. I just put him back down for a bit again. Well, I know he's doing better now that that crazy lady is gone. Judy, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Oh, you don't have to, dear. Well... You're gonna be the best grandma to Owen. And, well, I appreciate everything you've done for us. Of course. It's been my pleasure. And I'm sorry, too. And Zach and Owen are so lucky to have you. Hey, ladies. - Ready for lunch? - Hey. Hi, Mr. Mitchell, this is Officer McKinnon. I'm sorry. And since it was a first time offense, the judge set bail at only five grand. She was released on her own recognizance. No. Pick up. Pick up, pick up. Hi, you've reached Claire Mitchell. Please leave a me... Mm. Is there anything I can do to help? I just got Owen down. Oh, no, Liz, you've already done enough. Besides, Judy and I got it covered, don't we? We do. Hi, you've reached Claire Mitchell. Please leave a message. Where are you, Claire? I feel like this weight's been lifted off my shoulders. How long are you thinking about staying? Well, Zach has to be back in on Monday, but I'd stay here the week if you two wanted? And then Zach could come back next weekend and for a couple more nights? Yeah, that sounds great to me. Um... I think another week here would, would be lovely. Mm. Judy, are you okay? The lemonade. Judy, we're gonna get you some help, okay? Mom! My baby's been kidnapped. Hello? She must have parked back on the road. You head her off there, then drive her back into the woods. We both know them better than she does. You go that way, I'll go this way. Liz? He's not yours! Give him back, please! No. Mom! Stop! Vera, don't do anything stupid. Mom, just step away from the edge. Mom, please. How could you? I'm the only one who really loves him. You gave him away. She doesn't even know what to do with him. We can figure this out. Don't do anything stupid, okay? Be quiet! You'll never be able to take care of him like I can. You'll never be able to love him just like the way I do. You're so pathetic. You're not even fit to be his mother. I know what it's like to not be able to have kids. Don't you act like you and I are the same. No, I'm just saying. I understand. - Shut up! - Mom, please. What? You're the one scaring him. No! No! Mom! Mom. Congratulations, Liz. You're gonna do fantastic. I could never have done it without you and Claire. We owe you more than you'll ever know. Believe me. Hey baby. Come to mama. Come on. Hi. You're getting heavy. Smells great. - Claire made it. - With a little help. Oh, yes. Grandma's got you. Yes. Yes.
