Look, have you ever seen something so beautiful. Well, what would you do with such a dress? I would waltz. Oh! That is a dress for waltzing, Danuta. Fusia, people are staring. Oh, so let them stare. I do not care. Some day there is going to be a line of boys just waiting to dance with me. [RANDOM CHATTERING] So, that's why you like it here so much. There are no boys on your farm. No boys, no dances. It was boring, I hated it. Do you miss it sometimes? Miss my family. [GUNSHOT] FUSIA: What it that? I don't know. [EXPLOSION] [SCREAMING] [GUNSHOTS] [MAN SCREAMING IN RUSSIAN] Get of the street! It's the Germans! [EXPLOSION] Get to your homes, get off the streets! Get to your homes. It's the Germans!

DIAMANT: We are not all together. Your brothers are not here. [DISTANT EXPLOSION] MRS. DIAMANT: Oh! FUSIA: Shh. I am... Where are they? It is three weeks and no word from them. They are fine, Mama. How do you know? They were due back days ago. Where are they? What is keeping them? Mama, Mama, the back roads are probably closed. But you know Max, he will find a way. Maybe they can't get back, maybe the Germans killed them. They did not kill them! How do you know when they have been in the streets all day. Mama, Mama! [MRS. DIAMANT CRYING] It's all right, it's all right. It's all right, it's all right. [EXPLOSION] [GUNSHOTS] [GUN FIRES] [EXPLOSION] [EXPLOSION] FUSIA: Holy Mother, please protect us. [DISTANT EXPLOSION] Fusia? MRS. DIAMANT: Are you all right, darling? I have to go home, I have to see my mother. The Germans have stopped the trains. You could never get back. I have to see her, I have to go her. She needs me. No, darling. I promised your mother I would take care of you. [DISTANT EXPLOSION] Oh! Darling. Oh. [DISTANT EXPLOSION] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] FUSIA: I cannot see much out there. Everything is still. I shall wait a while. Then I shall go out and see what it going on. No, Papa. You know what it would be like if the Germans had their way. It would not be safe for any of the Jews on the streets. No, nobody goes anywhere. We'll all stay here together. Please, we have got to go out and see what is going on. Whatever it is, we have to know. I will not lose another member of this family. -I will go. -No. I will go, I can move about more freely. No, it's too dangerous. Please, please, please. Let me do this for you. I will be right back, I promise. [RANDOM CHATTERING] [SAD INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] By the owner of the command of the Third Reich, we wish you no harm. If you object, step forward. You are no longer Polish nationals. You are citizens of the Third Reich. By our command, everyone's order has been made here. Remain still. This is just a check. We wish you no harm. The city is now under German control. You are no longer Polish nationals. You are citizens of the Third Reich. By our command, everyone's is ordered to remain here. [GUN FIRES] This is just a check, we wish you no harm. The city is now under German control. You are no longer Polish nationals. You are citizens of the Third Reich. We knew they would be coming after us, there was no escape. We had only one window, so we played dead... until the Germans left and then we ran. They had shot all the Russian doctors and nurses. Once the fighting was over, the Germans had every road blocked. We knew we had to get back to you. What did you see out there? The Germans have cleared the streets. And, they have taken over the city. Max, what are my chances of getting back to my mothers farm. I have to see her. You will never get through. They're killing people who try to run. Who knows how long it will be before... Do not think about it, Papa. Who knows what the days will bring. But at least we are all together. [SHUTTERS CLOSING] [RANDOM CHATTERING] MAN: Please! Go! MAN: Children, go away! Go away from here. [KIDS CHATTERING] MAN: Please! [RANDOM SCREAMING] [RANDOM CHATTERING] [CHURCH BELLS] [HUMMING] The Germans say they only want peace. If we cooperate, it will be... [KNOCKING AT THE DOOR] Never mind, I will go. I need Mr. Diamant, please. I'm here. You have something for me? What is it? We've received a notice. MR. DIAMANT: We must pack. We have to leave for the ghetto by six o'clock tomorrow morning. [WHISPERING] The ghetto? My god! We only want what we can easily carry. Only what we need. Sh'ma Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu... Adonai Ehad. My darling son. May God bless you and keep you. May the light of his countenance shine upon you. May your days be filled with holiness. May your night be filled with peace. And you, my little one. May you be a blessing upon your people. And may you guide them through the dullness of the night. In the name of HaShem, God of Israel. We're saying Amen. ALL: Amen. I made this for you. This is a priest, and this is a rabbi. And they will marry us, so we can always be together. Our vow, Fusia, together. I promise you. I promise you. [RANDOM CHATTERING] Fusia? What are you doing? Packing. I'm going with you. Oh no, you can't. I have to. I have to go with you, you need me. Fusia! No, dear. Isaak needs me. No, Fusia... Fusia, now listen to me. Where we are going, is only for Jews. The Germans won't let anybody else in. But how will they know? I will not say anything, they will never know. The Germans know. The have a lost of every Jew in the city. They know our names. Then change my name to yours. Oh, Fusia, darling. You are a beautiful young girl. Don't be afraid to live. I do not want to leave you. You will stay here, you will live right here. We have discussed it with the boys and we are turning the apartment over to you. Everything is in your name now. You take care of it for us. So that when all this ends, we have our home and you waiting. I promise, I will. I'm sure. I promise. [RANDOM SCREAMING] [DOG BARKING] Henek! Danuta! Stay with me. I have to go with my grandmother. I will see you there. [CHATTERING] [DOG BARKING] [MAN SCREAMING INAUDIBLY] [CHILD CRYING] [CHILD CRYING] Take good care of this. I will. Thank you.

[MAN SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [SCREAMING] MAN 1: Get away, you almost hit me. MAN 2: I did not! MAN 1: Work in your space. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] We need your help. Yes, what is it? There is not enough food. We will starve unless you pay for us. You want me to sell this? Yes, with the money you get, buy food. I have to go. Wait, wait, Max. Where shall I meet you? Here? No, it is too dangerous. Go to the end of the ghetto to Kielsa street, I'll meet you there at 8:30 on Tuesday. I have to rejoin the line. [CHURCH BELLS DINGING] FUSIA: Lubek. Fusia? How is everything? How long since you have been back to the farm? Have you heard anything? It has been a while, before the Germans. Did you see my mother? And do you know how she is? It has been months and I have not heard from her. I hear the mail is not getting through now. I'm sure she is all right. Where... Where would a person go if they had a few things to sell. Where... like what? You should be careful with this! I have to eat. I cannot watch every move I make. Now please... please tell me. Where can I sell this? There is a man on Bradford street. His name is Vladisvak. You will see people around him. Just approach him... quietly. That's what everyone does. He will pick it up. [MAN YELLING] Ten zlotys. I need German marks. Marks? All right. I'll give you seven marks. Go, go on. Get out of here, now! [SOUND OF A TRUCK PASSING] [CALM INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] I need to buy some carrots. And some onions. [DOG BARKING] [SIGHS] [CHATTERING] MAN: Away from the fence! [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] You! You cannot be here. You do not move till I tell you! Stop it! Stop it! I am not doing anything wrong. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] I am trying to make business here. He has money, I have food to sell. You have to leave. No! I have to live. Now, are you going to let me make my business? Or shall I report you? I will give you... one minute. That's all. You understand? You cannot take chances like that, Fusia. He could have killed you. He would have if you had not amused him. Here, trade these. You are trembling. I am cold, that's all. We cannot meet here anymore. He will be looking for you. Where then? Meet me at the fence at Warszawa street. People do business there sometimes. The soldiers are more lenient. GESTAPO: You have leave now, Fraulein. The Jew has to get off the street. [MAN YELLING] [MAN YELLING] Good. Good. MAN: You will have more tomorrow. MAN 2: All right. MAN 1: See you. This is my friend Siunek. [MAN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] We have some problems, they're starting deportations. Isaak was taken. Where? To the work camp, near the border. It's one of the worst. We need you to go to him, to help him escape. I have packed him clothes. What about your parents? Can I see them? Not now. They're not... They wouldn't want you to see them like this. What about Henek and Danuta and Heim? Henek and Danuta were sent to a work farm. They return only to sleep. Heim's in a day group, we do not see much of each other. Will you go to Isaak for me, Fusia? Will you help him escape? Yes, yes. You know I will, I will. The train for Beouf leaves at noon. The camp is a few kilometers from the station. It is near your mothers farm. Be safe, Fusia. Okay. [TRAIN ENGINE BELL] Excuse me? [GATE CREAKS] Excuse me. Isaak Diamant? Is he here? Do you know him? I need to see him. Look at this place. There are no visitors. I will do anything anything. Please. Please. Just let me see him. Please? Anything. Just let me see him. You have three minutes. Thank you very much. Thank you. [GATE OPENS] [GATE CLOSES] Isaak. [PLEADING] Help me. Fusia. I'm going to take you home. Thanks. My home. Do they ever let you leave here at all? Only for my work detail. We go out in the morning and they bring us back by sunset. [WHISPERING] All right. When they bring you back tonight, I want you to try to separate from the line. And I will be waiting... in the woods over there... right over there. All right? Do not leave me, Fusia. No, I will not leave you. I promise you, I won't leave you. I am taking you out of here tonight. I brought you some clothes. All right, be safe. [GATE OPENS] It's all right, I won't leave you. I will be close by, Isaak.

Helena! Helena! Oh, Sweetheart. Oh! Oh! What happened to you? What happened? Where's ma... Where's everybody? Where's mama? The Germans took them away. They took them to Germany to work in a big factory. And she left you here all by yourself? She sent me to the people next door. Every day I come here and wait for her. Mama never comes home. Helena. Are you all right? Are you all right? Fusia, you won't go away too and leave me... No! No! I will not leave you, I will never leave you. You're safe, all right? All right, I'm going to take you with me. You're all right, you're safe. All right? [GIGGLES] Look at you! You're so dirty! [DOGS BARKING] [INAUDIBLE CHATTER] GESTAPO: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [DOGS BARKING] MAN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [WOMAN CRYING LOUDLY] GESTAPO: Silence! You, Diamant, out of line. Who are you people? Not on the list. Out of line. Mama, it is all right, [SOBBING] GESTAPO: Which ones? [DOGS BARKING] [DOG SNARLS] [SOLDIER SCREAMS INAUDIBLY] Come with me. GESTAPO: That one, he's back again. GESTAPO: Stay together! [GUNSHOT] [ALL SCREAMING] [CRIES] Just go away. Don't even be near us. Get back, before they... Shh, Mama! MR.

No. [DOG BARKING] [SOLDIER SCREAMS INAUDIBLY] [DOGS BARKING] [SOLDIERS LAUGH CUNNINGLY] [LADY CALLS OUT INAUDIBLY] She's not on your list. SOLDIER: Not on the list? Her name is not your list. No! No! [INAUDIBLE INSTRUCTIONS] FUSIA: Mrs. Diamant. FUSIA: Mrs. Diamant. GESTAPO: Go on, go on! Get in here. Papa! [SCREAMS] Mama! [WHISPERS] Max. [TRAIN RUMBLING] They're going to kill us, Fusia. They're going to kill us all. GESTAPO: Keep the line moving. [INAUDIBLE CHATTER] GESTAPO: Get through the gate. GESTAPO 1: [SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE] GESTAPO 2: Keep your heads down. GESTAPO 2: Keep moving. Put more in, Fusia. No, Helena. We must save everything, remember? A little bit each day. But I'm hungry now. I know you are, So am I. But we will be all right, I promise you. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Who is it? [WHISPERS] Hush up. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Stay right there, do not move. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] MAX: Heim! [SCREAMING] Heim! Helena, quick. Some towels and water. FUSIA: Sit down, Max. Max, shh. Do not look at me. FUSIA: It's all right, what happened? MAX: I should be dead! Tell him to go away. FUSIA: No, Helena. Please tell me. They took us. I jumped from the train. I screamed to Heim to jump. He would not jump. I will never see him again. Shh. I will not let them kill me, I will not let them kill me. Max... Max. I'm here, I will keep you safe. Henek and Danuta? I will find a way to bring them to us. Siunek? Helena will help, won't you? Helena, you must listen to me. I need your help. Max is a Jew. And there are some bad, bad people in our country now that do not like Jews. FUSIA: They want to hurt them. Why? I don't know. But you and I, we must help him. So, we're going to let Max stay here with us. But no one must ever know. All right? Not your friends, not the neighbors, no one. Can you do that? Can you keep this very special secret? FUSIA: [WHISPERS] Danuta! Danuta. Danuta. Danuta. FUSIA: [WHISPERS] Henek. FUSIA: Henek. FUSIA: [WHISPERS INAUDIBLY] FUSIA: First let me tell you, Max is alive. Where is he? FUSIA: With me, I am hiding him. And Heim? We don't know. He was taken to a camp. FUSIA: But you and Danuta are alive. But for how long? We want you and Siunek to come. No, there's no way. Henek! Henek! Listen to Fusia. Henek, there are rumors. The liquidation of the ghetto. They will not kill us. They cannot kill us all. They will! There was another action last night. More and more are disappearing. It's only a matter of time, and time you do not have. FUSIA: Please believe me. I need to go. Henek, listen to me. Max loves you, you are all he has. You must come. GESTAPO: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [METAL SCRAPING] HENEK: Please lady, don't say anything. [GIGGLING] [KNOCKING AT DOOR] [KNOCKING AT DOOR] [YELLING] I am coming! [KNOCKING AT DOOR] I'm here! FUSIA: I'm coming! FUSIA: Danuta! Max! Max! FUSIA: It's all right, come out. There's not enough money for food for all of us. You will have to get a job. Where? There is nothing out there. Bribe someone. FUSIA: With what? My body? I think we may starve to death. And you must be eighteen for the papers. You can go to the officials. I brought this. DANUTA: Suinek? Oh no, no, no, no. I cannot. No. SIUNEK: It was my mothers, you must. If her life was to have any meaning... then we must use this... we must use this to save ours. My father has more in the ghetto, go see him. Take what he has to trade for food. He is living with another family, isn't he Siunek? There was a child, her mother was killed. If there is any way, I would like to get them all out. You understand that hiding Jews is punishable by death? It's not just you, it's Helena. I have thought about it. There is no choice. If they are going to kill me for hiding four, then they may as well kill me for hiding eight. We will focus on all of these problems. [INAUDIBLE CHATTER] OFFICER: Fraulein? OFFICER: How old are you? Twenty. Twenty? FUSIA: Yes. Just last week. Look...I know I look young. I cannot help that, but I really need the work. So does everyone in Przemysl. They are families. Oh, I... I have a little sister. And she is only seven years old. Our mother was sent to Germany to work in the factories there. And I have no means of support. Ah, please, uh... I will give you anything you want. I will give you this. My mother left it for me, but I want you to have it. I will take any kind of job you have. Right now, there's nothing. But I may have an opening soon. But... you will let me know? It is getting late. There are others waiting. I gave him the pin. Siunek, I am sorry. I know I should not left without a guarantee, but he did not give me a chance. I understand. Go to the ghetto, to my father. He's waiting. [SAD INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [DOGS BARKING] [WOMAN COUGHING] [INAUDIBLE CHATTERING] I have gold and money still to trade. I have more, they will pay for food. Ms. Podgorska, will you take me and my daughter? There is no place for us, if not with you. Please? Julie won't eat much, only a piece of bread a day. I will eat nothing. I... I promise. Only please take us. Please? We will arrange a time for you to leave. You are welcome in my home, Dr. Shillinger. And Mr. Hirsch. All of you are welcome. [INAUDIBLE CHATTER] Max, Max? Oh, Helena, I need to talk to Max. Go. We cannot stay here. The Germans are relocating people into the city. And soon this building will be filled. We need another place. Yeah. Away from the center of town. We'll have to start looking. Right. Here... This... came while you were gone. From the work office? I do not know. I have a job! I have a job! Look! Look, look, I have a job. [SQUEALS EXCITEDLY] [INAUDIBLE CHATTERING] JOSEF: My name is Josef. I'm not a Pole, I'm of German extraction. However, if you do your job. I will treat you fairly. I am your supervisor. You are here under the orders of the Third Reich. And you must produce your quota each day. Now the materials we produce in this factory will go directly to the Reich, to help in our course for Nationalism. Now, if anyone falls short, or if there is a disturbance, there'll be consequences. By the same token, if you stay with the Reich well, you will be rewarded. That is all. LUBEK: Fusia? Lubek, what are you doing here? I work here now. The Germans took all the food, I had nothing left to sell, so they transferred me here. WOMAN: See you tomorrow. BOTH: Goodbye. Well, it is good to see a familiar face. Come, I'll walk you home. Oh, no, no. I cannot. I'm sorry, I just I spend most of my time looking for apartments. My sister Helena, she lives with me now. And, I have to find a bigger place to live. I hope you understand. I will see you here at work? If we are to survive, I must find another place to live. Please help me, so many have come to me and I do not know what to do. Um... ladies? Excuse me? Perhaps you can help me? I need to find a place to live. And, ah, maybe you know of something? I do know a place that hasn't gone public yet. I know the manager, tell him Christina sent you. Thank you. Wait! Do you want to know the address? Yes, of course. Tatarska street, number three. OLD LADY: Tatarska, three. And that ladder? Where does it go? To the attic. [PIGEONS COOING] When can I move in? MAX: Are you sure the place is all right? FUSIA: I am telling you, it is perfect. It doesn't have electricity and it doesn't have a toilet, but there is a well out back, and most important of all, there is an attic upstairs. MAX: All right, we'll all move together. You and Helena go first by day. And... we will follow at night. What about my father and the others? They will come on Saturday. Fusia is off work, she can lead the way, yes? Yes. By then, we'll all be waiting. [CHICKENS CACKLING] [CHICKENS CACKLING] GESTAPO: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] GESTAPO: Show papers. GESTAPO: All right, move along. GESTAPO: Papers, please. Is there a problem? GESTAPO: [YELLS] Your papers please! FUSIA: Okay! Yes, yes, sir. HELENA: Judy! Judy! Aren't you glad you've come to visit? Come, lets play. My sister and her friend, she has not seen her for a long time. Um, Helena, please, quiet! The neighbors. I must go supervise them, excuse me, goodbye! FUSIA: [YELLS] Helena, go home! FUSIA: [YELLS] Girls! I feel as though I'm being watched every second, I cannot go to the ghetto, I've been there too many times. [WHISPERS] I see my father, they are coming! No, no, no, no. Shh. [WHISPERS] Now. [OPENS DOOR] MAX: All right, everybody, up the ladder to the attic. [WHISPERS] Take a look around. This is your new home. That window? That's all you have of the outside world. Listen. You will go downstairs twice a day to relieve yourselves. And once a week to wash. If it is safe, we can all go down to stretch. This pail will be our toilet. Remember to speak quietly. Not only to protect ourselves, but to protect Fusia and Helena. These walls are thin. No one must ever know we are here. The slightest sound, a sneeze, a snore even can give us away. Now look at each other. These people are your family. This is your whole world. Learn to love each other. LUBEK: Is that roost for me? FUSIA: Of course. There is a party after work next Friday. Oh, what kind of party? Sometimes the Germans give us a bottle of brandy and a hunk of cheese, to reward our good work. We pool it all together and play until dawn. Will you go with me? No... I cannot. Oh! Why not? We will all be there? She has a little sister. That's right. And I have to be with her. So, we will have it at your place. No! No, we cannot. Why not? Because I have to set an example for her. Lubek, I promised my mother. A sacred promise. I have no room in my life for boys. Not until after the war. Not even a friend? Not even a friend. Not right now. [DOOR CLOSES] So... how it it? What's happening out there? FUSIA: Well, they have increased production at the factory. That cannot be a good sign. All I know is we are working overtime all of next week. An increase in productions means big win for the Germans. DANUTA: What if? What if we let Fusia rest a little? I'm all right, Max. I don't mind. Siunek? Mr. Hirsch? Is there something wrong? [LAUGHS] No, everything is fine. Tell them, father. Please. Mr. Hirsch, what is it? Before I left the ghetto, I promised three others they could join us. I didn't mean anything... Oh, God! You did not give them this address, did you? No. I told them you'd bring it to them. It's my nephew Monek, and his wife Sally, they are just married. And the mailman Janek Dorley. Janek? I cannot go back there. Fusia, my mother meant no harm. I know, Siunek. Problem is, if she cannot go to the ghetto, how do we get word to them. HELENA: I'll go. MAX: You are very brave, but you are only a little girl. FUSIA: That is exactly why no one would suspect her. Absolutely not! Its is out of the question. I can do it. [INAUDIBLE CHATTER] GESTAPO: What is that? GESTAPO: Stop! [SCREAMS] GESTAPO: What do you have in your mouth? [HELENA SQUEALS] Ow! [GESTAPO GRUNTS] [SOLDIERS LAUGHS] Fusia? I know, I know. They're here. Helena! Thank God! MAX: Come here, come in here, you two. Shh, what happened? [GASPING] MONEK: The Gestapo caught her, but she ran away. And came back for us. MAX: Helena. You're safe, you're safe. It's okay. MAX: I'm sorry. ONIK: That little child came back for us. DANUTA: What if they followed her here? What if they saw all of you? MONEK: They did not. How do you know? How can you be sure? We waited, we watched. It would be impossible. Fast little girl. Do you know what she did? She ate the paper with the address. She let them beat her, and ate the paper before she would let them come for us. [HORSE NEIGHING] FUSIA: Yes. Here. Thank you. [KIDS LAUGHING] [INAUDIBLE CHATTERING] [DOOR SHUTS] Here. [KNOCK AT DOOR] Shh, shh, shh. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] I'm coming. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Yes, ye, yes. Yes, can I help you? Are you Ms. Podgorska? Yes. We are supposed to give you this. Thank you. Oh, my god. Look! Look! It's from Mrs. Zimmerman in the ghetto. Oh my God. SIUNEK: She's a friend of my father. She says she refuses to wait any longer. She and her children are coming tomorrow. God, who is this woman? Did you know about this? I knew my mother has asked her to come when we first went into hiding. Why didn't you tell us? You realize the danger you have put us in? She is a woman with two children. That is three more people, where will I put them? How will I feed them? I am hiding ten Jews in my attic with the Gestapo all around here. And this strange woman sends two boys to my house. What if she were followed? What if they are being paid by the Gestapo to turn us in? What if... what if one of our neighbors suspects something and they are getting paid to turn us all in. What were you all thinking? Where are you going? You do not belong in the ghetto. I have business. Business? Will you take me with you? I don't know what you are talking about. I know who you are. We all do. You take Jews from the ghetto and hide them in your attic. We're watching. No, you're wrong. Ten so far, isn't it? May be two or three more. May be you will die. Would you die for a Jew? [WHISPERS] Take me, take me! [YELLS] Take me! GESTAPO: [YELLS] Take me! Mrs. Zimmerman. Did you send two boys to me? Yes. What were you thinking? Now they know how I am. What I am doing. Come. My children, Janek and Cesia. I will not give them my children, do you understand? They can take my life. But they cannot have my children. [SAD INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [DISTANT GUNSHOTS] [PEOPLE SCREAMING OUTSIDE] The liquidation of the ghetto. [PEOPLE SCREAMING OUTSIDE] ONIK: [RECITING A JEWISH PRAYER] [RECITING THE PRAYER] Let me see. Good hat, nice trade. That's a lot of food for just you two girls. Fusia says we have to stock food now because of the war. Where you get the money? From Fusia's job. I have to go now. [DOOR SHUTS] [GUNSHOT] [GUN FIRING] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [SIGHS] [INAUDIBLE CHATTER] [INAUDIBLE] Fusia. The Gestapo want to question you. About what? Your co-workers Amelia and Hans. As you know, Hans has not been here for a week. And now Amelia has gone. Oh, I don't know. I just talk to them... They're Jews. Jews? Now, we all have your secrets, Fusia. I do. I'm sure you must. I don't know anything about them. I know you don't. They are my responsibility. They've been hiding. I've been watching you ever since you came to work here. There is something in you I recognize. Something we share. You have to be very careful. Gestapo is everywhere. They listen, they follow. They watch us all. Josef. Please, please. I beg you to not be careless. I will keep the Gestapo away from here. Remember. Every moment is your life. Fusia! I have not had a chance to talk to you today. Josef has been watching everyone since the Gestapos visit. What happened? Nothing. Well, what did they want? Well, I don't know. It was something about missing parts. It was nothing really. Is it all right if I walk you? All right, may be part way. Aah, I want to see you Fusia. To be with you, let me come inside. No, Lubek. I cannot. Because of your sister? My sister, the neighbors. The war. It will not work, Lubek. I'm sorry. Fusia, Fusia, please. I will wait out here all night, if I have to. But I am going to be with you. Lubek, please. Who is the SS officer? That's my boyfriend. I cannot believe this, Fusia. How could you? I will never... ever forgive you. [SHUTS DOOR] I knew that photograph would keep him away. FUSIA: I don't want to keep him away! I want him to come inside, I want him to walk me home and have a quiet evening here. You know you cannot have that now. Not now, not ever! No one will ever love me. Fusia. You are so young. I want someone to love me, Max. Someday somebody will. What is wrong? She's sick. MAX: She needs food in order to break the fever. More than we can give her, more than we have. If we do not break the fever soon, she will die. I'll go for food, take her down to my room. [THUNDERCLAP] [DOOR OPENS] Where is the food? I think I was being followed, maybe by the Gestapo. [WHIMPERS] Gestapo? Don't you hear them? I hear them. I am giving myself up to them. [YELLING] I cannot stand this anymore! FUSIA: No! Malvena, Malvena! Malvena, don't! No, Malvena, stop! Stop! No! I am telling the Gestapo where I am. Let them take me. I cannot do this anymore. Stop, no! I have too, please. Shut up! [SCREAMS] Stop! Do not do this to me, if you want to create a trouble, then you leave! Do not bring them here! [YELLS] No! If they come here, if they come to this house... listen to me. You listen to me. If they come to this house, they kill not only me and Helena, but they will murder your children. Is that what you want? [SIGHING] [CRYING] No, no! They're out there, come on. Come on, come on [CRYING] Shh, Shh. Don't let the others hurt me. No, I will not. I will not. They will kill me. I will not let them, I promise you. I promise you, Malvena. You! FUSIA: No, do not touch her! No one does any harm to Mrs. Zimmerman or anyone else in this house. Do you understand? No one, touches her. [CAR DRIVING BY] JOSEF: My compliments and thanks from the Reich for tonight, for Christmas eve. My compliments and thanks from the Reich for tonight, for Christmas eve. Thank you, sir. JOSEF: My compliments and thanks from the Reich for tonight, for Christmas eve. JOSEF: Fusia? Here. I have something for you. I know, "with compliments and thanks from the Reich". Yes, another little kit from the Reich. I thought you could use the extra food. For your sister and all. Is from our house. I have to leave, Fusia. I shall be gone tonight. Why? I have to get out, the Front is getting closer, the Russians will be moving in. What do you think? Soon there will be an end to this? That they will be leaving? I think... I think it is getting late. And you must get home to Tatarska. Yeah. Josef? Yes? Thank you. For everything. Merry Christmas! FUSIA: Merry Christmas! YOUNG BOY: Christmas? Yes! It is December 24th, Christmas Eve. What day is this? It is Friday. Friday night, the Sabbath. It is a holy night, pull yourselves together and come downstairs for dinner. MAX: We've already had our bread and soup. No, no, I'm talking about real food, a feast! Come, it's Christmas! MAX: What is all this? We are going to have a party. Malvena, make something wonderful. I will help you! We are all so dirty. We must wash our hands. Oh, I will go to the well then. Janek? Would you like to go with me? Yes. FUSIA: Outside? Yes. MAX: Fusia? I told you, tonight is holy, no one will see. Come. MAN: One please. MAN 2: Take two. MAX: Don't look at my cards. It must be so beautiful outside. If only I could breathe the air I can. Who cares about breathing? I don't eat. What would you eat? Umm, bagels. Big sour bagels. You are thinking about bagels? I can, my bubbe used to make for Friday nights. This roast duck and cherry sauce, thick and sweet. And burnt potatoes with lots of butter. You'll get fat. I don't care. I want raspberry cream for dessert. [GIGGLES] Two helpings. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] [INAUDIBLE WHISPERING] Can I help? GESTAPO: You are Stefania Podgorska? Yes, I... You live here alone? With my sister, yes. Is there a problem? It's too big for you. GESTAPO: Too much space. Oh, no, no. I need this because... GESTAPO: For yourself and an eight year old? FUSIA: Yes. GESTAPO: No. No, we are taking over the entire complex for an army hospital. GESTAPO: The Germans need the space. You have one hour to clear out. I cannot possibly find another space to live in one hour. GESTAPO: That is not my problem. Just be out of here. [ENGINE REVS] Go, Fusia. Save yourself and Helena. What if they find you and I am not here to protect you? You've done enough for us. You saved our lives, now you have to got to let go of us. No. No. Please, I need your help. These people have done nothing wrong. They do not deserve to die. MAX: Fusia, you have to get out! The Gestapo will be here in fifteen minutes Max, do not worry. Everything will be fine. What are you talking about? I was praying and I knew that everything would be all right. Fusia. You are crazy, they will you if they find you here with us. Fusia? Gestapo! Go! Go! GESTAPO: Have you found another place? Not yet. It doesn't matter. You can keep the flat. Instead, we are moving two army nurses in here with you. They will take the bedroom here. This place is too small, too filthy for our Germans orders. We are taking the old school. That will be our new hospital. Clear out your room, Germans take priority of living quarters. Remember, the nurses report to me. NURSE: [SPEAKING GERMAN] Can I help you with anything? NURSE: [YELLING] Just stay out of our way! FUSIA: Okay. NURSE: We cannot have children underfoot. [INAUDIBLE CHATTER] NURSE: Frank? I want a radio over there. NURSE: And my photos in the bedroom. [MUSIC PLAYING ON THE RADIO] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [INAUDIBLE CHATTER] [THUNDERCLAP] [THUNDER RUMBLING] WOMAN: Fold the other end. MAN: It's good. MAN: I'm feeling cold. MAN 2: And what is that? [DOOR OPENS] [MUFFLED COUGHING] [DOOR CLOSES] [MUSIC PLAYING ON THE RADIO] [MUSIC PLAYING ON THE RADIO] [METAL OBJECT FALLS] [RAT SQUEAKING] [BED CREAKING] That's where we heard the noise the other night. Go on, Becher. See what is up there! Ow! Let go off me please. [RAT SQUEAKING] Damn it. NURSE: [YELLS] What is it? BECHER: Rats. BECHER: This must be what you heard the other night. BECHER: Oh, that's filthy! You're almost as disgusting as Jews, why don't you keep yourselves clean! Clean out your house, you live like pigs. [DOOR OPENS] Ssh. ALL: [LAUGHING] KID: [LAUGHING] Shh. [EXPLOSION] [EXPLOSION] FUSIA: [YELLING] Helena! Helena! Helena, come, come, come, come. [EXPLOSION] The Russians in Przemysl, we have to get out of here, now! FUSIA: I'm not going. [EXPLOSION] But you cannot stay here! No! No! I have to stay here in case my mother comes, you go. Go, go, go, go! NURSE: You are such a stupid girl! Come! Stupid, stupid girl. [EXPLOSION] Shh, shh. MAN: Jump! [MULTIPLE EXPLOSIONS] [GUNSHOTS AND EXPLOSIONS] MAN: Run! [MAN CRIES IN PAIN] It is so quiet. I will go see what is going on. If it is the Germans. Helena? Come along, Helena. It's time to go downstairs. [WHISPERS] Fusia? Whatever it is... I will come back and tell you. [WHISPERS] Please, save yourself and Helena. Come.

This is under the Russian control. You are a corroborator, traitor! No, I'm not, I'm not! No, they're not! They are not traitors! Do not shoot, do not shoot! MAX: We are Jews, we are Jews!
