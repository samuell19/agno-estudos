A TIME OF ROSES Do you believe you could interpret the face of your neighbor? Even if you touch the skin you'll feel wrinkles, muscles... They are twisting the facts. - True, it is a political question Historical research, science in general, pastime - perquisites, everything has been put to serve one single purpose The thing which may seem unbreakable, is often a great lie A small part which may seem very important - may be completely insignificant in relation to the wholeness We often think, that... We know nothing about her yet. Not even Raimo. She died in 1976 - Eight years before you were born So this fracture is thought to be older, - caused before the fall from the train As you know, we can't reveal this information to the public Of course not The case is old, there's no need to cause - fear and panic in the society Of course we will take the 08-group's opinion into consideration Just like everybody elses Without forgetting the responsibility for the entirety Are you still worrying about it? Rumors are different than the official opinion Rumors... She experienced a typical Finnish hero's death; - fell drunk from the train, - in the middle of the night, wearing stripe pyjamas (choir) "This is the last battle - we shall join the front line..." Only a few were able to realize the actual state of the things For instance the attitude towards the thoughts of Karl Marx - who lived in the 19th century, was strongly emotional One and another were swearing allegiance to his name, - while others were cursing We can ignore this whole mess of thoughts as a joke, - of which history offers numerous examples The 1960's and 70's meant - the strong rise of politicizing This was seen in the Western World - as a tremendous increase of socialistic ideals During that period - Europe saw the most violent protests of the century The civil war was about to break out in America Maybe as a result of this, radical right-wing groups were formed - both in Europe and America All these different political groups said to be - more democratic than others Therefore the whole unsettled period was named - ''The Decades of Democracy'' While the rest of the world was going through a difficult crisis, - people in Finland, among the few privileged countries, - lived off the fat of the land In the late 1970's the developing countries suffered from, as they called it, - "The Great Hunger Years", which lasted about 15 years The politicians in power - handled the situation poorly The hunger-driven troops in Africa, Asia and - South America, tried to reach the Nordic welfare states We can be amazed, - that the situation didn't lead to global war The wars were limited to local conflicts... The whole period of time with diseases and migrations - was a peculiar mixture of new and fear-ridden Middle Ages Even in many industrially developed countries, large scale disorder broke out from period to period Some people came up with the conclusion that - a foreign war was the only way to unite the nation Berlin crisis in 1982, - which began in East Germany - and the conflict between China and USSR a year later - brought the world dangerously close to total war The Cuban crisis, which people were horrified at exactly 50 years ago, was - according to the researches, a point of departure - to the assassination of president John F. Kennedy, - was a children's game compared... - That is not correctly presented The actual wars and killings were focused on poor countries It was clear that these kind of immature political crises - had to be stopped, and focus on - removing world hunger The disagreements between socialist and capitalist countries - started to ease off. Freedom and humanity... - Bullshit! Not freedom but a new kind of spiritual oppression As a result of the development, the society reached - its present formal state. We can be proud of it! Regressive politics have been put aside - from the way of righteous, knowledgeable scientists The old class division is gone - due to the increase in social maturity Violence has been replaced with liberalism Liberalism creates comfort, - safety and freedom In other words the power is used by the experts, - so-called unbiased officials, who are so distant - from the people that it stinks! There is your freedom! Panu already let himself be fooled by Raimo, - something I understand well I personally have nothing against Raimo And there's nothing crooked or base in our methods, - you can rest assured of that Has the information arrived yet? - It's been promised for today But what is it? - All they had. She was no celebrity You know I want a modest, ordinary person As we expose Raimo, - we'll expose the whole Historical Institute Nothing like in that... What was it now? History of the Kennedys. - Two years ago Your memory is excellent, darling It was a wonderful show. - I guess so It's in the practical level - where things are truly revealed, like in perks But it's easy to mislead there, too What happens with you is the same thing that happens with us, - and happened last week in Argentina Raimo is just one of many, but we must begin somewhere Yes? - It's Pepe Lahtinen Could you come to my room? I've got the statistics for your special exhibition - it just came Oh good. I'll come right away There it is Everything goes through here And what am I, a computer? - I know She's there again Start videotaping! Howdy! - At last! Here's all we had in our archives Born in Kuopion Maalaiskunta in 1946 Whoah, she'd be... Yeah, father. Baptized! Funny, baptized! Saara Maija Katriina. Moved to Helsinki in 1965 Married in 1968, to Matias Turunen. A divorce... Worked at a dru... What? as a saleswoman in a drugstore additional income as a model Pretty ordinary What would you like to eat? Died getting hit by a car in a movie shoot in May 1976 Got something good? Calories 30, 25, 100... - Two of those! This? - Exactly You won't regret it. - Thank you As a 16-year-old won a competition organized by a women's magazine - and got to visit Helsinki for a few days She got to meet celebrities, - visit a theatre and the premiere of some movie Hey! "Now I know what it is to be close to celebrities!" "Will you return some day? - I sure will!" This is exactly what you are looking for How'd your wife recover from the mess? Don't get your hopes high yet Here you have a brilliant possibility - to frame a new, helpless victim of history And to jerk some tears Come on now We don't KNOW anything yet We stick to the facts Go on, answer it. It must be the Central Archive Central Archive. Additional information on Saara Turunen Connecting to the search unit I'm sorry, all fingerprints from 1973 are faded Wrong humidity in some old office Do you need the photographs? - Photos, everything Today, for us - progress is - the augmentation of achievements For them progress was questionable and uncertain Give it to me! Overpopulation, - novel weapons of total destruction, - looming famine - meant for a person like Saara Turunen - a threat mixed with fear Where does this last image come from? What's the origin of the last image? - News-photo archive She's appeared in newspapers later. I wonder what's the reason Politicians dictated the direction progress was to take But what did the ordinary citizen feel and experience? What was the good of society and where did the good of individual stop? It might not be so easy for us today - to comprehend the problems of an ordinary person like that, - for who among us is ordinary these days? Class distinctions have been eradicated, everyone - participates in the society according to their nature This prosperous societal field - doesn't exclude anyone anymore That's why we have also gotten rid of fear Did Saara live here long? She was here for at least two summers I don't remember those days so well, - I was so young Saara must've only seen a little girl in me She had recently divorced when she moved here I think she forgot to take those pearls with her Was Saara like a part of the family? She was a golden girl She died in a traffic accident in 1976 Two years before my mother My mother liked her so Did you meet her anymore? Once she came here and gave me this A personal gift She was always friendly to us young ones, as well I don't believe in the stories they wrote about her What stories do you mean? All kinds of bad ones She didn't live here, anymore A beautiful song Sure it's beautiful Every time I listen to it I imagine Saara's singing to it Though it's just instruments Of course, my dear friend. I have already begun to take action Good! No rush Our form of life is not in any danger yet, - but they seem to be up to something Bye. - All right, always yours You know about those labour issues from last century We are in urgent need of a statement - about the obsoleteness of strikes Strike? Yes? I was just asking about seeing the papers on - the Sariola case. Just privately, you know You may ask Raimo. How come? Isn't Raimo there? I'm talking about the issue. Excuse me, I'm a bit busy Of course. - Strange A public figure is often a myth Would you like to read this book? - How did you get in? The cleaner. - You appear to be in good terms Look Did you buy her tender memories - off that old hag? Saara used to sell these as a sales representative, - and gave them away to her acquaintances as personal gifts What you are talkative today. - I'm always talkative By the way, now I know Saara's scandal - She asked many men simultaneously for abort money A good idea in itself What should her hair look like? What are you driving at? I just wondered what this girl is like Who? I saw her at the exhibition a few days ago She looks like Saara Turunen How should I know. - Apparently a waitress Central Archive Could you look up a person who looks approximately like this? About so, yes... thank you What are you going to do to her? Possibly they could be identical, - if they had lived in similar conditions See, we could create - a portrait of a past person using a live model Brilliant! A dangerous crossing... three hundred... You guessed right Raimo wants to go fetch Kisse from Kuortane That's good! They might get to know each other more closely He wants to see Kisse's living conditions You are speeding, slow down News brief interest group 4 Airplane crashed in Nairobi, 1500 dead The Pope accepted man foam Neomessians expect world to end in a week Hairiest youth in Finland switched to another faculty Pedestrian belts in Stockholm's centre malfunctioning We don't need guns! Our thoughts are enough The United States to continue their separation policy Booty mill conquers the world This is Anu Huotari's answering machine We are now... Can you see the future? I do It is populated by hope There is nothing but hope and dreaming Peculiar - is the beach-head of future Hope and dreams have permanent memorials there Saara Turunen's last interview Latest phase of the abort debate Abortion money from many A three-dad gig Images to the future From blood fumes to the future Will rises from the ruins Strange Will stares truth in the eye Does its simplicity make you wonder? Only great things are to build and to work To build and to learn to love They don't want to give the council decision rights, that's what it is We can't be bought with perks nor with wages Our only possibility might be to go on a strike Excuse me, I wanted to meet - an engineer named Kisse Haavisto She's here, but she's on a break, playing Can I go there? - Of course! They just get excited if someone goes to look at it (whistle sound) Excuse me, may I have... Do you recognize this picture? Listen Kisse, your backhold almost broke me I was told, that... Good, Kisse! Now you can push it from the pelvis. That is important All right, grab her! Not like that! Grab that, put your hand there. Deeper, deeper Good! Lift! You've got talent for this! Wait here Was it the picture... - What? Was it the picture that caught your interest or..? - What? Few are interested in information, you know. - What? Information! - I have a learning machine home I mean, it's rare that anyone is so interested that - they'd visit an exhibition more than once Information is actually exactly what we... manufacture That's our product Hold on, Kisse I'll be ready in a second Listen, I think you could... But you don't even know me You are a free person, aren't you? and only a free person can pose as an oppressed one This Saara Turunen was socially afloat, - like the weakest people still are. A victim Me a victim? You might find her interesting to get to know She had this raw power, - like a small vampire yet very pathetic I'm not like that! That's exactly why! She was supposed to save a child from getting hit by a car After shooting the scene she put the child down and - straightaway got hit by a car coming from the opposite direction Horrible! - Isn't it? I'm sure you'd be good In getting hit by a car? Hi! I can't hear you! A strike? Come here! A strike? I wonder if they've thought it through? Who do you mean? These technicians of yours or whatever they are Or is it just mass restlessness? I've heard it comes up - after abusing mood enhancement pills, - but it's very easy to cure I don't know - if it's so easy to cure in this case If the deputy manager of the technical department and the main economist - want to keep stalling perfectly clear reforms And you can't even talk to them, of course they must be fired I'll say it straight: They are complete retards Surely. Incompetence must be opposed always and everywhere It's not really so Some people don't want to believe that others want to live, too And money isn't the only reason Well said There's many sides to life and many sides to every human being You're coming, right? - We'll see Is it your child? - Yes Is she kind? - Ask her! Of course children are kind No, not even close! - But you knew Saara back then How can you know that? I can barely remember myself I spent many years abroad when she died I was married I have been happily married for 53 years now You were talking about some films? Yes, she liked filming and I filmed her a little Here you have a couple of them, but it's confidential Since you are investigating her. - Of course, of course That old weirdo We could still blackmail her with this material, - if we wanted. - Can you still use these? Of course you can Truth comes first There is also the point, - that I helped Saara financially in the beginning She was a good girl, it was a pleasure to help her We spent a nice time together She wasn't the kind of person you were thinking of It is not just a question of financial matters Go and talk your shit to the other people, - why are you always harassing me? Hey hey, take it easy. Listen, I am warning you I know rats from the smell Let me smell you Hell, I am smelling you! (oriental music) (alarm is ringing) (alarm is ringing longer) Everybody was here last evening Is that so Are you on the picture? No, it is dad. What if i would go a bit... - Okay! If you have seen one, you have seen them all Do you remember her well? Of course. Every model is special for me. I remember Saara specially well I was the one who found her Later she learned how to move - and started to strip Really? A profession like any other It wasn't easy at that time If Miss would come in the picture But we just came here to ask a little Everybody is worth a photo, when you know how to do it right That Saara had puffy breasts There you go and... There Saara had exactly same positions I was the one who took her first nude shots Do you mean full nude? Of course, of course! Art photos - Not too virgin like, but beautiful Beautiful There. There you go! There She was forced to continue Otherwise her husband would have known Little titties Good Okay, that's enough! Does this Kisse remind you of any of your models? No. Why? That's it. Thank you for your help Good day! I hope we're not distracting you too much Even though it's a beautiful day Very, very. Did you bring my films with you? I haven't had the chance to look at them yet Remember to return them Oh, my god You are like two berries, if you keep your hair that way That's true, beautiful (Old man:) So young. Saara was the type of girl, - she was like youth itself, - so natural and real I could have helped her when she was dying, - if I hadn't been abroad Why did you go abroad in the first place? It was my work Foreign trade was already being conducted back then And your wife was there? - True Maybe it was for the better that she got out We met each other in the summer, - It was the late sixties The war raged in Vietnam back then I'm sorry... Wrong room She played in a total of five movies which add up to 127 seconds That's a biography in itself In other words this is what she made her living out of Not really. She was a saleswoman in a boutique She got additional income through stuff like this I think she was an ordinary, natural girl I think she liked working in sales She lacked the talent to do anything else Have you already measured her IQ? Yes. She had had to career counseling Liar! Here, have a look She lacked education, not intelligence What do you think, Kisse? - I can't say anything yet I think you're forcing an exception out of Saara, - instead of an ordinary person Oh well, even an exception can be a reflection of her time What exceptional things are you going to reveal about me? It's important to keep all possibilities open in this profession People are different and sometimes surprising What if it was a suicide? She had problems, a scandal Or it was fear of losing her role She had nothing but her paltry looks You look like her, but prettier Yes? - It's Anu. Do you remember what kind of clothes - the saleswomen at a drugstore wore? - No Waterdrops dry up - from round lotus flowers Silent, lonely, no people in sight - during the third moment of the night A leaf drops tinkling, - I wake up, the dark cloud of my dream scatters The night is boundless I can't find my way to the dreamland When morning, I walk around - the garden paths In the horizon - the tired wayfarer stops - in the mountains one more time - and looks at the old garden - reminiscences in his heart, - the swallow tower is empty, - where is the beauty queen? Swallows, you make your nests in vain - behind locks The past and present are like a dream, - that we don't wake up from We stare at the past, - we mourn the future - and compare them The yellow tower is shining in the night - and I - sigh in the night You'll be a magnificent Saara Slower, slower Savour the details Let the clothes caress your skin It makes the spectators move Imagine them licking you all over with their looks And enjoy it That's it! Good, good. This has the colour of the times Beautiful, brilliant! Damn good thing Good. Just like that! Beautiful Wonderful, do it again Remember you're wanted It's about the institution of nudity Be more base Right, good! Then the next photo! If you had lived in the 19th century, - there would be at most a painting left of you Instead there exist newspaper stories and films about Saara Turunen and a vast amount of archival data Even more will be left of us But how do you think it'll benefit a researcher? Do you mean that it's difficult to distinguish - between true and false information? It's even more difficult to interpret a large amount of information than small Helping people see is the most important thing to me How come? You have exactly the same eyes. Darling Howdy! Are you alone? - Yes Of course I've got a lot of work to do right now You are a true conservative Work and personal income are your whole life Why can't you just live and be? - I think I've lived enough And besides, I really have to work now How's it going with Kisse? You're funny Can't you see the state you're in? Yes You're always like that when you're in love. Can't you remember? Well, gimme a kiss No, like this And remember, if you have the courage to sleep with Kisse, - she's from this century, kiss kiss She has plenty of potential for development I think she could learn to do more individual work Are you tired of her? That has no effect I just think that Anu Huotari is ready to move on There hasn't been a single mention of the strike on TV Can't you tell Raimo about it? Sure, but we mustn't hurry. - Who cares about that? Raimo is a typical elite official, - and these things don't matter to them We talked among the boys today When the strike is over - we'll get that international room tropic to the hall Can I get Kuortane 1788? Kuortane 1 788? - Yes Yes? - Raimo Lappalainen from the Historical Institute, good day Are the strikers still as stubborn? First lane, turning right forbidden Have you heard there's a strike at a factory? Who'd be crazy enough to go on a strike? They don't exist nowadays There would've been a mention on light channel or somewhere Sorry for bothering you so late with this insurance business Hello, here's rep... - Fuck! Where have you been? - Kissing It's good that you have healthy hobbies Please tell me, cofidentially, - how many were there? So you don't want to answer? What do you reckon the viewers are thinking? Our sympathies are with you Straighten out the misunderstandings, don't leave room for mean rumours How did this series of events begin? In the end it's a question of destroying a life Dear viewers, you can't accept just anything from the development of the '70s. Our board of experts, - where the greatest talents from the church, psychology, sociology - and the home protection union are represented, confirms this Horrible. Poor thing She doesn't seem to be in control of the situation She's been picked on so much she's finished She's done it herself Are you certain? - Of course By acting vulgarly and giving rise to a scandal Although she can be understood She was practically looking for her end What did she have left but lies and creeping old age So death was the correct solution? In a way Do you mean that everyone, - whose life isn't real, should die? The lowest branches of a tree will always be in shade They'll wither and fall off Of course I'm sorry It's a pity to leave just as things are beginning to happen Can't it be organized in some way? The manager said I'm needed in other duties I'll have to take a training period and so on Congratulations! We'll manage. And Kisse is a big help Move on, darling, and keep your head up! And we'll stay friends, right? Let's go out sometime and march all over the town Where did you say you were from? - The Historical Institute Oh Have you collected them yourself? Are you from there too? - She's my secretary I've collected them myself, who else Nothing is as unselfish as owning books As I already said on the phone, - we're not looking for a scandal Could be. I don't know I understand you've had your disappointments The scandal caused by Saara - must have been a hard blow to you I was already divorced, remember that! I was able to get rid of - such a lowly creature in due time But it didn't stop her from causing me shame - even after our divorce She even damaged my position in the library I was naturally outside it all, - but you know how dirty people's imaginations can be You're sitting on her favourite chair, miss So she lived here? - No I moved here when we divorced You didn't remarry? Collecting like this must be a lot of work After you lose your eyesight, only smelling remains Why don't you try how her face feels like? Why don't you videotape them? Why don't you videotape them? - Say what? Why don't you videotape the interviews? Because I think he's an old idiot I said, why don't you record the interviews? Wouldn't it be more real? Think so? I think it'd only disarrange Saara's image One must stick to the essentials. Besides, I can't - concentrate on anything but you Let's dance I don't know how to, but you can teach me It'd be beautiful... It'd be beautiful to trip on your legs. - You're crazy It isn't easy to influence him I know that He thinks he's acting sincerely He is acting sincerely and that's just the danger Raimo has been presenting the results of his research They reveal clearly that almost everybody only watches - the Light Channel programme. - That's correct And channel four is truly free Anyone can present their opinions there, - but nobody is watching We don't know how people could be made to understand If they get to choose, they'll take the easy way No problems, no suffering It's so damn clever. There's a multitude of choices, - but only one is designed to succeed It's like we have a switch on our heads. We let ourselves be deceived Censorship is attached to men's own heads full of piss A couple more years and we get people moving We must start today Just don't do anything inconsiderate Turn on the Light Channel at eight o'clock this evening and you'll see What do you think about the future? How come? - What's it like? Our future? - Or generally I don't know. - You should know What are you doing? - My work, some calculations My head hurts. - Take a pill I hate pills I don't think much can be said about the future Whatever the precision of predictions - or the scientific basis of fantasies, - the personal qualities of a researcher are always the deciding factor If he's optimistic, he sees a bright future, - if he's pessimistic, it's gloomy Are you sure? Can't personal influence be accounted for? I'm afraid not What do you do with the research, then? Different people do different things The situation is such that during the last 40 years, - especially in the late 20th century, - more than 27000 affluent people have been preserved to wait for better times How has this preservation been done, professor H?me? Their body temperature has been reduced to halt - biochemical activity. Thus rotting has been eliminated The body has been emptied of blood and the veins have been filled with a preservative Does it seem likely that they could be woken up? It might be possible in the future Maybe already in a hundred years. But we aren't sure - if the preservation method has been good But I'd say there's hope Even if the rejuvenation succeeds, - could complications arise? - Oh yes The biggest problem for these people will be fitting in Just imagine waking up in a hundred years These people might not get on well in a strange world Adjustment might come about by being given - familiar items or clothes What if they are seized by a deep depression anyway? It might already be possible to move - a person's intelligence to bionic data units I'm afraid that the scientists of the future - would seize the cerebral activity of the most intelligent ones - and would let the resurrected die again I'm afraid that - that the season of peace and impartiality can't continue Dear friends! I represent the strike council of Kuortane nuclear plant This is a peaceful, nonviolent demonstration You may not have heard about our strike But we want everybody to know The power must be removed from executive organs - and experts feigning impartiality We invite everybody to join in the decision-making Making decisions that concern us all Step by step we'll expand our strike And all power plants shall join it And if one night lights go out at your neighbour's, or your home, or the whole town or the electricity is totally cut, you must know that - behind this issue is a battle organization - that thinks about you We demand that officials responsible for decisions - join in reciprocal discourse with us, and we will - continuously inform you about the situation on channel four We will advance peacefully according to plans, - without violence. We maintain the pressure with our work, - our numbers and our existence Dear viewers, you've only been shown shadows You've only been given weeds And yet... the world is rich! There'll be plenty of roses for all andand... No, no! Who could be behind something like that? You can't trust anything anymore Any amateur can come to the programme - and start talking about progress Like we all weren't doing everything we can for it Can't you..? - Shut up! If they knew what the situation really is - they surely wouldn't crave for power Dear viewers, you've only been shown shadows You've only been given weeds And yet... the world is rich! There'll be plenty of roses for all andand... Didn't you see it? They shot him! Shot him! So what? How many do you think will be shot, if people - are allowed to roam and rave - knowing nothing about anything? You and your kind are preventing - people from knowing anything What do you want to know? Tell me, what are you people so eager to know? You are being fed - and for that you may remain silent Of course! But think why! Coward. Coward. Coward I'm above all an official, - it's among my responsibilities to support the impartiality - that is necessary for our progress I think Olli is right What? We have a responsibility Besides, I'm not so sure about Raimo In what way? - That he's evil If we want possibilities for people and ourselves, - they must be given to his kind, too Has he already messed up your mind? On the contrary. When the show is ready, I'll reveal our plan - to him and he can choose Hell no! Don't be so sure about Raimo, Kisse You don't know him yet That's why I don't want to decide anything about a man I don't know These are for you? - What now? Are you going to betray me? I'm sorry about yesterday. I was shocked Of course. I'm sorry as well, darling I didn't remember you were old friends Honey. - Darling There's the last photos of Saara on that wall Five minutes before her death It's as if she already knew. - Isn't it I absolutely want a better death - on this show than getting hit by a car Something more dramatic We'll switch the car for a train, like this It runs along tracks undeniably like death Saara is waiting on the tracks, runs, and saves a child, - just like in reality. Good Then she dodges, puts the child down - and move away. Remains standing But at the same moment a train comes from the opposite direction Saara doesn't notice. She's being warned She can't hear or doesn't she want to hear? There! The tragedy has reached a conclusion Oh my God! What will I do? What do you mean? Nothing Nothing What is it, honey? - Nothing Nothing Like in a dream or an old movie People's destinies approach each other A machine that brings people together What would you say if we got married? I feel we belong together You could complement my aspirations - and I could help you You'd be a dream wife for me Who am I now? Saara or me? You want to hurt me. All right. No What do you bring Saara into it for? She's dead You only have to choose - Me? Do you want someone who's alive or someone who's dead? It's odd Like work didn't matter You and your fucking strikes! I could take your foolishness on the palm of my hand and blow Truthfully, - my best intention... If I could give... at least a small droplet - of consolation to people - I can consider myself successful Just you try to take this right from me Are you leaving me now? No I'll do my job and all the rest. - What rest? Everything that goes along with it Here, take a walkie-talkie Do I press the button? - Yes Now we'll shoot the train approach Saara ha saved the child and put in on the ground The train has just passed You look forward in relief and fail to notice - that a train is approaching from behind Can you hear me? - Yes Jump aside at my command Can you hear? Listening. - I can hear you Jump! Do you hear? Jump, jump! Jump, jump, jump! Jump! I told you to jump, it'll run over you Was the camera running? Time? - 11.40 On Light Channel today at 3.30pm - "Entertainment for millions" At 4.10 - A depiction of a person who lived 50 years ago, - based on documentary material by Raimo Lappalainen You ask about the researcher's part. It's always secondary Especially in a show like this, - telling about an individual in the past perhaps an unimportant character, - who, through research - is raised to an image of her time The researcher is impartial, humble, neutral In a sense you could say he doesn't exist The face of the past a show with the lightness and beauty of a folk song Yes, of course. You are right, - but it's better to fix it - than leave it as it is Ambiguousness is like sugar to an ant, - it attracts rabble like nothing See what I mean, eh? I'm serious! Do you think I'm playing fucking games, what? There's reason to avoid attachment, anyway attachment, to what? The thing is, - is someone doesn't understand, - they just don't understand Take care, or I'll have to handle the issue some other way Do you fucking understand? In a minute we'll begin the show based on - Raimo Lappalainen's documentary material, - The face of the past, - a depiction of a person - from a half century ago Consistency is no god There are different grades to it First you must determine the task, - and the task creates the laws of consistency And what comes to honesty, - it's always relative Relative to work and the task Saara Turunen died in 1976 She was a relatively unknown person, - ordinary and modest She lived a short and fervent life Our compassion lies with her like with every individual, - large and small, under any circumstances In those times time was measured by the beginnings and ends of wars Violence was included in all important decision-making, - at least in the background In spite of the repugnance of violence, - we can understand it, - for in those times most people were wandering around - without awareness of themselves and their place in society Saara Turunen was one of them They were societal dynamite - full of extreme pressures, the controlling of which - was beyond the capabilities of the politicians of the time It wasn't until our free society that - these pressures have found individual and humane ways of dissolving Little Saara, as we can now say you are trying to reach the form of life - that has today become - consistent, secure, everyone's own What is it? Democracy. A humane, liberal form of life - That has to be protected from conflicts like a blossom Well said ...as the melody of tomorrow plays the hour strikes, and night recedes and the people and work are in glory Oh, so many have fallen tired on the roadside Oh, so many have died in battle but earthly might shall not dishearten us we'll create a strong peace to drive quarrels away join us in brotherhood, peoples from every nation then even the roses will start to bloom on the road of our happiness Need, misery, everything will be left behind so, the poor people of happiness, I'll lift my head up high!
