[heartbeats] [short sound bursts] [heartbeat and faint breathing] [doctor] I'm here, I'm doing... [doctor] Come on sister! Where are you? [sound of flickering] [sound of metallic objects moving] [heartbeats stops] [doctor] Check out time. [doctor] Care, nobody? [doctor] Yes. [elevating sinister music] [acoustic ambient music] [music continues] [sound of heavy thud] [trailer gate of truck shuts] [dramatic music] [plastic rustling] [quiet sinister music] [ominous music and plastic moving] [groaning, slapping shovel] [dramatic music continues] [spade drops] [moan] [door shutting, engine starts] [atmospheric music] [dramatic music] [low chattering] Yay! Oh, my god. That was tough. -Do you think you past? -I don't know. I'll guess I find out in a couple of weeks. OK, let's do a shot, right? Uh, I'll think I'll have a beer. -Seriously? -Yes! Why? Boring! -I heard Kevin is coming. -Ah, yeah. He's hot and he likes you. What more do you want? Plus you're not getting any younger. Ouch! I'm sorry. Hold on one second. Hey, mom! Mom! Mom, I can't talk to you, if you're not going to say anything. [crying] Are you OK? What's going on? I got a call about Hayley. What is it now? [mom] Can you come home? Mom I can't come right now. [crying] [Abby] Can I come by first thing tomorrow? OK. I'll come by tomorrow, OK? [sigh] [melancholic music] [Abby sighs] Mom! Seriously. [Abby] You can't get yourself worked up like this. A friend of Hayley's called from Texas. A Jenny something. I guess they worked together in a bar in Laredo. She thinks something bad might have happened. Mom. How many times have we been -through this with Hayley? -I's different this time. I mean even when she's off getting high, She always checks in. I get phone calls in the middle off the night. You know what it's like. I haven't heard from her in three weeks. Not a peep. I've left messages and emails, nothing back. Well, that is unusual, but... Yeah, now with her friend calling, I know something has happened. [crying] I'm sure everything is OK. If your father was alive, he would have been out there weeks ago. I know things aren't good between the two off you, but, Abby she is your sister. Your blood. She needs your help. I need your help. I'll look into it, OK? [mom] Thank you. How was the exam? It was fine. [melancholic music] [a crow craws] Hey, Tim, It's Abby. It's been a while. I'm actually headed out to Texas. Let's catch up. [Abby] Hayley! Abby! For the fifth time, call me back. There. [continues in Spanish] Nothing to it. [doctor] A few sutures, and we are done. [in Spanish] No, Doctor. Good. Are you ready to give it a try? -[in Spanish] -[knocking on the door] Paco! [in Spanish] [blips from heart monitor] The body? Go out there and find that little punk! [escalating music] [car driving in the distance] [apprehensive music] [doorbell] Hayley! Hello! Hello! [suspensive music] Hayley! Hayley! [Abby] What in the world? OK. [dramatic music] [mom] For Plastic surgery? I'll have it back to you in no time. I don't know. You know I have been doing good? Staying clean. Yeah, I know. This is just going to help me getting ahead. You know? [sigh] I swear. You'll get it before you know it's gone. [mom] Hayley, that's not the point. [mom] You don't need that stuff. You don't. [Abby] Hey! What's going on? Nothing. [Abby] Mom? Hayley, there is no more money. -[Abby] We talked about this. -It's different this time. -Butt out! -I know it's different. -The answer is still no. -It's not your money. This has nothing to do with you. This has nothing to do with me? I am trying to do something good here! Save it, Hayley! Don't you think you have done enough damage to this family? -Abby. -Mom! It's got to stop! You have done way more damage than I have! [Hayley] Miss. High and mighty! Too good for your own father! You broke his heart when you dropped out. -How dear you? -The truth hurts, doesn't it? At least I didn't snort my family's savings up my nose. That's enough, girls. [Abby] Unbelievable. We have carried you for so many years. It ends now. Choke on it! We're done. No problem. We're done, Hayley. Don't come back here asking for handouts. [mom] Hayley! [door slamming] [blip] You have two messages. [answer machine] Hey, Hayley It's me again, Um. Trying you. So, call me back. [Abby] Hayley! Abby! It's the fifth time. Call me back. [blip] End of messages. [intense dramatic music] Hi! Who are you? I'm Hayley's sister. -And you? -Building manager. Where is Hayley? Ah, I'm not sure. Have you seen her around? I'm not her keeper. Not short on charm either. Is there anything I can do for you? Rent is due in a few days. Well. Until then. [apprehensive music] The sister is here. [apprehensive music] Deputy Corbin, please. [apprehensive music] Tim! -[Abby] Long time. -[Tim] Yeah, tell me about it. So! Cryptic message out of the blue. It's not really your style. -[Abby] Yeah, sorry about that. -[waitress] Menu? -[Abby] Unexpected trip. -[waitress] How about you, Hun? Uh, I'm OK. Just coffee, please. What brings you to Laredo? I am looking for my sister. Your sister! [Abby] Remember Hayley? Sure, she lives here now? Yeah, I guess for like the last year. Things seemed to be going OK. She is working at some place called Ray's. Keeping her nose clean. Thank you. The strip club? There's only one Ray's in town. Oh, wow! Uh. Yeah, I guess that would explain the wigs and clothes. Oh, Hayley. She's missing? [Abby] We're not sure. Something is not right here, you know. I just have that feeling. That's what would have made you a good cop. -Nah. -It's in your blood. You were one of the tough ones coming out of the academy. Until you bailed. So, what are you doing instead? Um, I just took the bar exam. It's close enough, I guess. [Tim] So you need my help? Maybe. I'm going to poke around a little bit, see if I can come up with anything. You should file a missing person. Yeah, but I don't know if she's missing, you know? It will get her picture out there. Couldn't hurt. Thanks, Tim. Us blue dogs have to stick together. [ambient music] [club music] -Can I help you? -Hi! -Are you Ray? -Are you looking for work? If I was? Then I'm Ray. [small laugh] Do you have a girl that works here called Hayley Morgan? There are a lot of girls that works here. Right. Well. Maybe this will help. Yeah, Hayley. -Right, -I'm looking for her. And you are? I'm her sister. OK. Yeah, I can see it now. So, is she around? No, she doesn't work here anymore. Oh? When is the last time you saw her? I couldn't really say. Take a guess. Maybe a month. Maybe longer. Do you mind if I talk to some of the girls? Are you a cop? [small laugh] No! [dramatic music] Unless you're planning to buy a drink you might want to get out of here. OK. Thanks' for your time. [phone ringing] Hey, Mom, [sighing] [mom] So! I just got into town today. I'm at Hayley's place now. She's not there? No, but that doesn't mean much. [sighing] Don't get upset, mom. We don't know anything yet. I'll call you tomorrow with an update, OK? OK. Love you! You too, Hun! [Abby] Michael! Michael O'Hare. Journalist. [nervy music] [tapping on the computer] [club music] So! -Are we set? -For? Hips, lips and cheekbones. I want to look like a young Diana Ross. You have something for me? A ticket, the bus leaves at 8:00 a.m. Be on it. [phone ringing] Oops! Give me a second please, sweetheart. [ringing] We have a situation with the errand boy, Paco. What? He panicked and disappeared. The body? The body is not where it should be. Listen, Victor. We can't be connected. Do you understand? Don't worry, I'll take care of it. We can't be connected! I said I will take care of it! Victor! Victor! [Slamming the telephone down] [in Spanish] One for the road. So, is Milo a done deal? Your cut is the least of your worries. We have a situation. [squeaking door] [dramatic music] [door opening] [suspensive music] [door slams] [suspenseful music] Hello! [squeaking door] [front door shuts] [suspensive music] Oh, I have her picture as well. Great. Have you ever heard of a local reporter called Michael O'Hare? He's a bit of a quack. But he makes for a good read. Do you know anything about the border clinics that he has being writing about? Oh, Yeah. Unfortunately I do. That's the curse of a border town. Is that something that you guys focus on? No, not really. You know, it's not a priority. I found this envelope in Hayley's apartment. I guess she was gathering some information. [Abby] It was a brochure on plastic surgery. With names and costs and... Hm, it's interesting. To be perfectly honest with you. We have our hands full with guns going out and drugs coming in. Yeah, of course. You bring the package by, and I'll see if I can help. Sure. [Tim] OK, sign here. Alright, let me process this. You know, I would love to find that O'Hare guy. Seriously? He is always moving around. But he filed a few death threats, so we have the addresses. [Tim] You did not get this from me. No. Al! Can you pull Michael O'Hare's addresses and give them to Abby? Thanks. You keep checking in. Yeah, will do. Hey, excuse me! Hey! [Abby] Wait! [upbeat music] Stay back! -Are you Michael O'Hare? -Not another step! I mean it. I'll use it. Who do you work for? I don't work for anybody. My name is... I saw you at the apartment, and meeting with the deputy. You've been following me? Dam straight! Look, I'm not sitting on the apartment. OK, I'm staying there. I'm Abby Morgan. I'm Hayley's older sister. Can we put the mini mace away now? Is it the death threats that have you living like transient? No, I have been getting death threats ever since my first exposÃ© on border clinics a couple of years ago. That just fuels my writing. It's when they actually follow through with the death threats that got me spooked. Seriously! Yeah, last year, a couple of Scary looking Mexican guys came by my place and ruffed me up a bit. [Michael] They made it very clear that I was to stop. So, did you stop? I did for a bit. But I was getting anonymous letters from people who had been hurt and cheated. So how does my sister fit in to all of this? I've been going to the club looking for an insider. She had heard about a couple of the girls going to Mexico getting really cheap surgery. She was thinking about doing the same thing. So, you sent her undercover? No! We'd only talked a couple of times. She seemed sympathetic to the stories I was telling her. Did you bring the letters? Like your giving me a tip. Are you sure you're down for this? Yeah. [Michael] Since she was already exploring surgical options I simply asked her to pass on information. Right. [Abby] This is for you. I knew she'd come through. When is the last time you saw her? I'd say it's about a month ago now. I leave tomorrow. How are you feeling? A bit nervous, but I'm sure It's normal. Everything I've gathered so far is in an envelope at my place. I got my blue card today. Blue card? Yeah. [Hayley] It's a key to get on to the bus, and over the border. When I get back... I should have everything you need. -If anything should go wrong-- -It won't. You'll be fine. -[Abby] So, were you two-- -[Michael] No. Like I said, we only talked a couple of times. And you haven't talked to her since? No. I waited about a week or so. I figured she needed time to recover. [Michael] I went looking for her at the club. [Michael] Watched her place, and nothing. So she might have never come back from Mexico? I've been waiting for the right moment to look for the envelope, but they have been sitting on her place. Wretched landlady. I figure there's got to be something in there and it might be a clue. [Abby] My sister is a bit of a scatter brain. [Michael] This is good! Why? Does anything look familiar? [Michael] This clinic I called a couple of times and I just got the machine. I've never been able to zone in on who's involved from the medical community on this end. There's some important names here. Dr. Sparks. Wow! -[Abby] Do you know him? -[Michael] I know of him. Looks like he did the consult. I can't wait to break this thing wide open. Look! This may all be Pulitzer-material for you. All I want to do, is find my sister. Yeah! There's somewhere I want to take you. I don't have time to mess around. I like your sister. She was really kind and open with me. Look you don't have to do this alone. I know the town and it's people. I can help. OK! [knocking] -Hi, Michael. -Hi, Jean. This is Abby Morgan. -Hi! -Hi! -[Jean] Please come in. -Thank you. [Jean] What can I do for you? My sister is missing. I'm sorry to hear that. [Abby] I have a picture. She's very pretty. Thank you. She went across the border to one of these clinics, but... -She hasn't come back. -How awful. Hayley was collecting information for me when she disappeared. -Information? -About the process. We believe Dr. Sparks is involved. Was he your doctor as well? [Michael] Jean, I brought Abby here so you could share your story with her. Hoping that you maybe could lead us in the right direction. This is not something I'm comfortable talking about. I understand that. Please! My surgery... in Mexico... was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. [Abby] What happened? When my husband Burt passed away I... I... I really didn't think I would be interested in another... You know... Man. [Jean] But, dating and... he'd been gone four years. And I was fifty. So I thought... Maybe some... cosmetic work... You know. Enhancements might make me more... desirable. I remember going home in a taxi, and I was... very sick. A lot of pain. I had strep infection. But I was... too ashamed to tell my physician. [Jean] One morning I just... [Jean] I felt like my heart was going to explode. [Jean] So I called an ambulance. The doctor said I was very lucky to survive. Because... my liver and my kidneys, they were failing. And I had gone into toxic shock. [Jean] I didn't tell you this, Michael, but... [Jean] Well, because I was warned not to. But I had a visitor one afternoon. He was a very... frightening character. He said I was not to tell anybody what had happened. And that was what was best for everybody. Was Dr. Spark your consulting Physician? But, he didn't perform the procedure. Was it a Mexican physician? Nothing was like it was supposed to be. The clinic, the doctors... It was all so scary. -Jean, you don't have to-- -I'm not afraid anymore. Those were not real surgeons. [Whisper] Oh, my god! Real surgeons wouldn't do this. I want them to pay for what they did to me. Why did you take me there? I had a feeling she would open up to you. It's your sister and all. I have to go to that clinic. The Villa Majestic? Yeah. I don't think that is a good idea. If that's where my sister went, then that's where I'm going. Americans disappear in Mexico all the time. -It's dangerous! -You don't have to come. -Come on! -I don't care if it's dangerous. I need to find her. Alright. Fine. Thank you. [car door closes] [suspensive music] [intense suspensive music] Abby! Are you OK? Yeah, I think so. [Michael] Shall I call an ambulance? No! No, I'm OK. -[Abby] Did you get his plates? -No! You've been here two days, and they're already gunning for you. [Michael] Maybe I should follow you home? I'm OK. Are you sure? 7:00 a.m. [ominous music] [door squeaking] -Hey, you! -[Abby] Tim! Hayley's apartment was ransacked. -Really? -I just got back. The door was open and the whole place is a wreck. [breaking glass] Oh, my god! Someone is still here. Abbey, get out of there! Please hurry. [Tim] Abby! Abby! Abby! [ominous music] [squeaking sound] Stop! -Woah! -Who the hell are you? I'm Jenny. Hayley's friend. Why are you trashing the place? I didn't. I live across the hall. I came over after they left. Who is they? Some guys from the club. [Abby] What club? Ray's? Yeah! How do I know that you didn't let them in? It was Irena the landlord. I'm worried about Hayley too. I'm the one that called your mother. Please! Put the knife down. You're the one that's been looking through the blinds? I've been wanting to talk to you. Why haven't you? It's hard. They've got eyes everywhere. Hayley isn't the first girl that's gone missing. Then why wouldn't you stop her? She was determined to go through with it. Most girls come back, and they work off the surgery in a couple of months. What do you mean, they work it off? If you can't afford it, Ray will spot you. You've got to work it off. Have you talked to her since she's been gone? No! She said if anything went wrong that I should call home. She gave me your mother's number. She said you would come looking for her. She always talked about her big sister. Abby this and Abby that. Shoot! I feel like I know you. You're prettier than your pictures. [Jenny] I'm sorry. [Jenny] So. What's your next move? I don't know. Look, I've worked at Ray's a long time. If you need to know how things work there. Yeah, maybe. [cars skidding] I might. [police siren outside] Do you want some help? Down on the ground! It's OK. She's a friend. Is everything alright? Yeah! We are alright. Just the place is a mess. Is there anything missing? I think I have what they were looking for. I'm sorry to have you rush down here. It's OK. I'll file a report. It was a couple of guys from Ray's. Right? Jenny? Yeah! It was. Did they have a key? No, apparently the landlady let them in. I'll talk to her. Thank you. Do you need help? No. We got this. OK! I'll talk to you later. Sorry! [ominous music] You got to be more careful. [sighing] [loud slap] You can be replaced. Where is Ray? So? Did you find anything? No. We trashed the place. It was nothing there. Is the sister backing off? Hopefully she got the hint. Handle it! I will. Otherwise all of this goes away. I got it. The cops? It's covered. [dramatic music] I'll check in with you later, OK? You have a right to be worried. I love you too, bye. -Hey. -Hey. -Huh! -You look tired. You really know what to say to a lady. Huh, sorry. A couple of guys from the strip club tossed Hayley's apartment. What? Are you OK? Yeah! Tim is going to take care of it. The deputy? Stop being so paranoid. How do you know these guys from Ray's? Jenny. One of the dancers that lives across the hall. Alright, are you ready for this? Yeah, let's go. [Abby] You're OK? Yeah, I just hate going through check points. We'll be fine. [Michael sighing] [Michael] Officer. There you go. Hold it together. Thank you. See? No problem. Is this the right street? Yeah, according to the map. Maybe it's just back further on the property. Doesn't make any sense. Maybe we took down the Wrong address. This is the place. It should be right here. Unless it doesn't really exist. -Why would they... -Think about it. So, what? She could just be anywhere right now? How are we supposed to find her? I don't know. I can feel her slipping away. [Michael] Don't say that! Do you really think she just forgot to call? I mean... Something happened. Either she died on the table or... Maybe they found out that she was feeding you information. No, there are other possibilities. Like what? I don't know. [Michael] But you can't give up hope. Great. How do they even know that we're out here? This is private property! What are you doing out here? Do you want me to ask you in Spanish? No, sorry. We are just looking around. It's a beautiful landscape. [ominous music] You're going to have to come with us. [in Spanish] [Michael] Get your hands off me. -Michael. -[police] Give him your keys. -You got to stop. -I don't think You understand the gravity of the situation. Could you call deputy Tim Corbin In Laredo? He will be able to clear all of this up. Get into the car. I'm sorry. Is this really necessary? We didn't break any laws. Trespassing. And resisting arrest. Passports and cellphones, please. No way! We can take them from you if you like. Can I make a phone call, please? A phone call? [policeman laughing] You are not in the United States anymore. What's going on? [sighing] This is bad. They can't keep us in here. You still don't get it, do you? They are all in on it. They can do whatever they want with us. Come on, Michael. Not now. Think about it. How did they find us so quickly? Our luck has just changed. [policeman] Are you sure about this? [Tim] Yeah. [police man] Your call. He's releasing you to my custody. Thank you! [Tim] You too, Michael. [policeman] You got lucky this time. Don't come back here. Did you at least find what you were looking for? No! There was nothing there. What do you mean, it was nothing there? It's just land. There is no building, no clinic. Nothing. Where do they bring the girls? I don't know. It's just another dead end. I can't pull that favor again. Alright, follow me back. I can bring you across the border. [Abby sighing] OK. [Abby] What do we do now? I don't know. Maybe Jean Will come forward. Maybe we can get her to press charges. That's going to take too long. [knocking on the door] Jenny. -Hi, come on in. -Hi, thanks. Jenny, Michael. He's helping me find Hayley. It's alright. We can trust him. Yeh, I have seen you around the club. Yeah, I'm a reporter. Did you find the clinic? No. The address we had was a cover, There was nothing there. So what's next? I'm trying to figure that out. Maybe I can ask around the club? Can you do that without drawing too much attention? That's it. The club. Plastic surgery Dr. Sparks. I'm not following. I'll go in and get a consultation. For what? It doesn't matter. Boobs, hips, thighs whatever. That sounds great, Abby, but they know who you are. They'll see you coming a mile away. There has to be some way. Or... -What? -You could enquire. We just need that blue card. -Exactly. -But wait a minute guys What are you talking about? Take a seat. OK. Tonight at work, just do your regular thing. [club music] Good night? Well. I've had better. What's up, honey? I'm looking to make some improvements. A little tuck, if you know what I mean. Are you serious? I'm not getting any younger. You still look good to me, baby, Can you set it up? Consider it done. You're a doll. [Jenny] Tummy tucks. A little bit off the sides. You made arrangements with Ray? Yeah. It's covered. [doctor] OK! Now, I will make sure they take extra special care off you. [small laugh] [Jenny] Thank you. [Abby] Perfect! Thank you. Be careful. Yeah, Michael is going to follow the bus. It leaves at 8:00 a.m. sharp. [Abby] OK. You should get out of town for a while. No! You're going to need this. You got to play the part. Thanks. Just find her, OK? One way or the other. Just find her. Hey! We're on track. [Michael] Things are going to be OK. [Michael] We will find her. -Thank you. -You don't have to thank me. Your help means a lot to me. [atmospheric music] Hi! Can you please make sure that deputy Corbin gets this? Thank you. Not too late to change your mind. Just don't lose the bus. [suspensive music] [nervy music] Officer. -Please pull over. -Is there a problem? -Why do I have to pull over? -Now! Morning, Al. I didn't think you'd be in. Tim, when you get this I'll hopefully be in Mexico at the clinic my sister went to. You'll find anything you need in here to start a case file. I didn't tell you, because I knew you would try to stop me. After I find my sister Michael and I will make our way back across the border with the rest of the info you'll need to put these people away. Hey. We have a problem. [shouting] [wheels skidding] Hey! -We've got to go. -What's going on? Jenny sold us out. Now, I will explain on the way. Clean this up! [knocking] Hello, everyone! Follow me, and I'll take you in. You can wait in here until we call your name. [phone ringing in the background] [speaking Spanish] They just arrived. She'll be on the bus. OK. [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [car door shuts] Hands up! Arrest him! Keep your hands where I can see them. This is not necessary. I'm looking for my friend-- Hey, what the hell! I thought I told you not to come back here. I'm searching for my friend. She's out here somewhere. Can you at least help me out? [door opens] [dramatic music] [door squeak] Uh, bathroom? [hitting sounds] Where is my sister? [speaking Spanish] Put her in the room with Paco for now. [screaming] [crying] [shrieks] Sheriff, If you're not in on it, then please help us. This is happening all over the place. You got to know about it. Of course I know about it. [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] OK. [thump] OK. [Abby] What can we do? OK. [car approaching] -So? -[speaking Spanish] We have her locked up. Perfect, then we will wait. [Boss] I'm not happy about this Dr. Martinez. Your problem [continues in Spanish] You have a problem up north. [Boss ] Well then maybe we should take our business somewhere else if you can't handle it. Oh, thank God! [slamming of car door] -[Boss] Who else has this? -I don't know. But she has been working with that reporter, Michael. Is there enough to make a case here? Not quite yet. There is no proof of murder or illegal medical practices. If she disappears... It all goes away. What are we waiting for? I want to find a new place. -Find me a new place. -Calm down. This is fine. Don't! You son of a bitch! You kept pushing. This can't be about money. Why else? She was my sister! [screaming] [punching] [Tim] Oh, it's so sad. [Boss] Wait! Ray, not here. Doctor! Can we take her around back and get this done, please? What are we waiting for? [police siren] Damn it! Relax, lose the gun. [gun shots] -[speaking Spanish] -[police] Let's move in. [speaking Spanish] Hands up! [speaking Spanish] [Police] Get down on the ground! Down on your knees! Stop I said! Are you OK? What happened to you? Sorry I got caught up. -[police] Come on! -[Ray] Take it easy. So, that was all of them? Yes! And the doctor and the nurses are in on it. Raul, take them in to the cars. Wait! Can you translate something for me? Yes. Did this woman come through here? [speaking Spanish] Do you recognize this woman? [speaking Spanish] if you recognize this woman. [Abby] Did this woman come through here? [speaking Spanish] Please! [speaking Spanish] [Abby] She was my sister. [policeman in Spanish] -[speaking Spanish] -Yes. [speaking Spanish] [Abby] Do you recognize her? [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] He said that... she was a patient here and that she died on the table. I can show you where the body is. What? I can show you to the body. You can? Yes! Please! -Jevon will take you. -Thank you. I can come with you if you want. It's OK. Where is the body? [sobbing] [crying] Mom! I'm bringing her home. [Abby] I love you! [music playing]
