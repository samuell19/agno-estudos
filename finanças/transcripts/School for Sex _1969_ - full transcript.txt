Hello, pet. If I'm not back in two hours, you know what to do with her. Good luck, guv. - Thanks. Giles Henry Rice Wingate, you have been charged and pleaded guilty to fraudulently, and with full knowledge that you were committing an offence, convert to your own purpose and use sums of money, amounting to 30,000 pounds, being moneys due to the company, no less the Salisbury Estate and Mortgage Company, of which you at the time held the position of Managing Director. It was, in my view, right and proper that you should plead guilty. I've turned a good ear to what I've been told by learned counsellor peering for you, in that you have already repaid the money you stole. It is however my duty to pronounce sentence upon you. Have you anything to say? Well... No. May I please, your Lordship? I would like to ask the court's indulgence, to allow me to say a few words in the defendant's favour, in the hope that your Lordship might be persuaded to mitigate whatever sentence your Lordship might have in mind. Very well, Mr Berridge. We've heard very little from you during this case. As you can see, my Lord, my client is no ordinary criminal off the streets. He is a man who comes from an excellent family background. He has wealthy titled parents and a high academic schooling. He had an exceptional career at the university and an even more outstanding military service in a cavalry regiment. He was in fact awarded the military cross for gallantry on the Normandy beaches. Upon demobilisation from the cavalry in 1946... He arrived home from overseas to the dower house, which had been given him by his family on his 21st birthday. Only to find that both his parents had been killed during a bombing raid whilst staying at their Knightsbridge apartment in London. And that he had inherited the entire Wingate estate, valued at that time at nearly three million pounds. Master Giles, glad to have you back, sir. Glad to be back, Fred, and how are you? I'm very well, sir. Good. You're looking younger than ever. Thank you, sir. After you, sir. You remember Claira, our cook, sir? Course I remember Claira, how nice to see you again. The maids are new, sir. Where did you find these girls? The village? Yes, sir. Amazing. Good heavens. I must have known you when you were all just born. Tiny things. It took very little time for the handsome young bachelor to saviour the pleasures of civilian life. And on an unearned income of several thousand pounds per year, he was able to give very careful thought to the methods in which his newfound fortune should be spent. Many long hours were spent in meditation over his wealth of business ideas. But first things first. And Giles Wingate's army experiences had given him a commendable sense of class equality. It offended him to be waited on by uniformed servants, and he promptly ordered is staff to abandon their uniforms for something a trifle less formal. And to adopt a less formal... Ooh, Polly, good morning, I say. ...relationship with their master. I don't know what you've got all this on for. That can come off. One member of his staff however, called Polly, and a brazen, fortune seeking wench if ever there was one, took advantage of the young Wingate's democratic socialist ideals, and within a few weeks, became the first Mrs Giles Wingate. From that moment, Polly embarked on a spending spree never before equaled. In one day, for example, she purchased from one London store 11 fur coats. She consumed 31 sports cars during one year. Needless to say, with young Wingate down to his last two million, the marriage ended in divorce. After Polly the maid, came Tanya the so-called movie actress. She came to stay for a weekend, bringing one of her films with her. Sit. Don't scream. Now I'm going to have you. Joe, that's my broad. The whole place is empty. Take that, you dirty rat. Give me your negligee. Right, give me your bra. That's fixed it. My client, seeing his guest suffering at the hands of gangsters on the screen, was so moved with compassion and pity, he asked her to be his wife. Three months and 500,000 pounds later, she took off with a homosexual actor and has never been seen since. From the publicity accrued from this tempestuous romance, Wingate became the target for every cunning, gold digging wench in the country. As fast as these women moved in, so my client married them one after the other, making in each case a vast settlement on the injured parties. Then came a stenographer, Mary, who was so transparently after her employer's money that just anyone could have seen through her. Nevertheless, she became Mrs Wingate number five. Or was it six? Marianne, a dancer, who soon stripped Wingate of 20,000 pounds in alimony as efficiently as she stripped herself of her veils. Ingaborg, a Swedish masseuse, who by her highly skilled training in the manipulation of the human body. Extorted, among other things, a promise of marriage, which ultimately led to yet another costly divorce. These and other adventures at the hands of ruthless, mercenary women... brought my client to the brink of ruin and forced him, much against his will... Your honour, I must object. This man... Sorry, your Honour, no objections. Much against his will to borrow money from his own real estate business, which he has since repaid and which he now regrets. I mean he regrets the borrowing, not the repaying. I ask your Lordship to put yourself in my client's position and imagine yourself beset on all sides by scheming, ambitious women, forced into dishonesty and to deal as leniently as you can with this unhappy, exploited man. I suppose we must. Two years. But my Lord... Suspended, of course. We will now adjourn for lunch. Well, sir, we virtually won the case, didn't we sir? Well yes, of course. What does it mean? Suspended sentence. You're free. I think I did pretty well for you. Of course, paying the money back did make a difference. By the way, how did you manage to get hold of it? The 30,000, I mean? Shall we say, a rather wealthy lady? Well, I suppose with all your experiences you have learnt a trick or two. Yes, it's been a costly education. 30,000 back for a three million investment. However, I shall now sit back and reap my rewards, as they say. Really? Thank you. What exactly have you in mind? There's still one or two details to be sorted out. Yes of course, I'm sure there are. I've already put several advertisements in different periodicals. Let me get this straight, a school for sex, hey? It might work. Of course, it will. Dear old chap, I've been conned, swindled, and seduced by some of the loveliest, cleverest birds in the world. I think I must know just about every trick that there is to know for lifting money from the unsuspecting male. Now, if I impart this knowledge to, say, half a dozen girls to start with? On a commission basis of, say, 33 and a third percent? Can you see the potential? Oh, by the way, where we're going I think... Yes? One thing I've learnt about my fellow men, and don't think I'm alone in my vulnerability, is a truth, and it's simple, the shrewdest, toughest, hardest businessmen in the world have got one great weakness. One Achilles' heel. One chink in their armour. And that is... - What? Crumpet. Sex. That's quite, quite... Take this girl here for example. Unsubtle, I'll grant you, but watch her. Watch her audience, you might learn something. One of the problems I haven't surmounted yet is how to obtain the right pupils. Well, I think I might be able to help you there. I have a friend who's a probation officer. I think I could get you a regular supply. Really? - For a commission, of course. Would you like me to make some inquiries? Discreetly? Of course. Ooh. Here we are, Fred, back in business. You can take the covers off now. Glad to see you back, sir. I really thought you were a goner, for a couple of years at least. Do you know, sir? Wingate Manor has had a master for the last 10 generations. I remember dear Johnathon Wingate, your grandfather, sir. He very nearly did time because his... - Yes. Quite, but now it's time to think of work. We've got to earn some money, Fred. Think about paying your wages, hey? That's all right, sir. Don't you bother about me. Anything on for lunch, Fred? Made some soup, sir. Quite frankly, I wasn't expecting you. Excellent. Your cooking qualifications will come in handy. What do you mean, sir? Oh, I've got lots of little surprises for you, Fred. You know all those jolly little pictures you've got tucked away in your cupboard? Well, you wait and see what's going to happen down here very soon. Good god. - What is it, sir? Don't worry, I'll soon shoo her off. No, just a minute, Fred. I think this might be the lady I'm expecting, our new deputy headmistress. She doesn't look like a school mistress to me, sir. Well she's got rather, shall we say, special qualifications. Show her in, will you, Fred? Really good, sir. Mr. Giles Wingate? Good morning. You must be the Duchess of Burwash? Yes, my husband, the late Duke of... My goodness, what a charming kitchen you have. How many kitchen staff have you? Well, we have Fred here who chefs for us. Anyway, now that we're in the kitchen, perhaps a cup of coffee? An enchanting idea. Or perhaps something a little stronger? Much better. Brandy, please. Fred, a large brandy for the Duchess, and a dry Martini for me? A Martini and a large brandy for her grace, certainly, sir. Now, Duchess, you wrote to me in answer to an advertisement in the Times. I note in your letter that your husband the Duke died in 1966. What have you been doing since then? Dear Archie. Yes, I took some time spending, I mean, tying up his estate. Such a lovely man. You know, it was the publicity in the News of the World that killed him. Oh, interesting. You have experience with girls, yes? Your large brandy, madam. Your Martini, sir. Thank you, Fred. Cheers. That will be all, Fred. That will be all, Fred! Now, Duchess, you were saying? Your experience with girls? Yes, indeed. The Windmill, I was head girl there, you know, then the Lido in Paris, and after that, I had my own modelling school, a big success that was, until those wretched girls let me down. Let you down? Yes, the papers played it out, of course. Called it the Cabinet Cuddles Affair, you probably remember it? Everybody else does. It was in 1956. No, I can't say I do. Nothing really. After a late debate on the budget at the House of Commons, some of the MPs had to stay overnight, and when morning came, nobody could find their clothes. That Ursula took them, I never did like the girl. Although anyway. 23 of my girls happened to be there at the time, quite innocently of course. Nobody believed them. That's how I met Archie. He was Minister for Internal Affairs at the time. We were both completely exonerated. Absolutely fascinating. Oh, well, Duchess, I think that we can say that your application has been successful. Now, before we discuss your percentage, I mean, your salary, I think I should give you some details of the school and your duties. At this moment, on its way from London, is a minibus containing a group of girls. Hey, Clappy, this isn't the way to Holloway. Please, call me Mr Clapp. We're not going to Holloway. You've been paroled, we're going to Wingate Manor, a new approved school. Are you coming with us, lover? Oh, go away. Leave him alone, Beth, or is that the best you can do? We've seen your type. - Quiet. Are you okay, Harry? Are you kidding? Here, what's all this about Wingate Manor? It's some new school they're taking us to. Progressive rehabilitation or something. Oh, yeah? Well we've got to get you all out of here before we get there. Don't let him suspect anything, I'll think of something. What's going on back there? Nothing, Mr. Clapp, sir. Where are we? Just passed a small village, don't know what it's called. Anybody about? - No. Well if you see somebody, let me know. I've got an idea. Just passed a copper, he any good? Bloody marvellous. Get Clapp to stop the bus. Throw a faint or something. - You're mad, with a copper? Do it quickly, girl. You, Beth, you do it. Oh, I can't. - Do anything, it doesn't matter. One, two, three. What's going on? - She's fainted. It must be the car drive, it affects some people like that. What's the trouble? What's going on? She needs an aspirin and a glass of water. Yes, look, there's a house over there. They'll help. Where? - Through the trees. I can't see any house. Of course there is, my eyesight's better than yours. I'll go. Oh no, you don't. I'll go. Remember, no funny business, girls. I'm going to lock you in. That worked all right. Hey, Harry, what now? - Get undressed. Everything? Yeah, everything. I'll tell you what to do while I'm picking the lock. Hurry. You're joking, it's cold. - I know. Come on, hurry. Oh, I've got stuck. Come on, hurry up, girls. I've done it. Come on, quick, because he's coming. There's no sign of a house here. All set? Think you can remember your lines okay? I think so. You dirty old man. - Taking advantage of. Who the hell do you think you are? What is this all, why have you taken your clothes off? You're disgusting. - What are you doing? Get back in the bus this minute. Please don't do this. Get back into the bus, immediately. I won't tolerate this nonsense. Girls, please. Taking advantage. What are you doing? - We've heard about you men like you. "Let's go for a swim", you said, "change into your swimming costumes", you said, "take those clothes off", you said, and then you attack us. I guess you're just a dirty, dirty, dirty old man. Don't do that. - Now, now, now then. Is this man annoying you? - Yes, officer. Thank goodness you're here, officer, this man just set on us. All we wanted was a lift, then he makes us strip like this. Oh, absolute nonsense, Sergeant. My name is Horace Clapp and I'm a probation officer for the Crown. A likely story. Do you have any credentials, sir? Of course. I thought something like this would happen when I saw this fellow pick up these hitchhikers, officer. Ah, are you a witness, sir? Yes. I was walking along the road when I saw this fellow scouring the curb, he was obviously looking for an easy pick up. Eventually, I saw him pick up these four young ladies. Absolute nonsense, Sergeant. Here are my credentials. This, sir, is a membership card for the Raymond Revuebar. Here. Ah, this seems to be in order, sir. Are these four girls in your care, sir? Yes, Sergeant. These girls will do anything to evade justice. I'm taking them to Wingate Manor, and I trust you'll allow me to go unhindered and forget this little incident. It wouldn't look good on my record. Wingate Manor, sir? - That's right. Well, I suppose it's all right. - See you at Wingate Manor. All right, girls, come on, into the bus. Come on, come on, come on. Why aye, sir, mind how you go now. Thank you, Sergeant. Wingate Manor. Oh, oh, oh. Hello, petal. Gave me a little bit of a chase, didn't you? You thought you gave your little sparrow the slip. I beg your pardon? The minute I saw you in the street, I said to myself, "Hector", I said, "that is the most beautiful bird that you've ever seen in your life, and you must have her", I said. Have me? - Yes. Have you for my trouble and strife, my wife. Such a lovely bird, in such beautiful feathers, must be courted very, very carefully. So let me court my beautiful one. Give me those lips that I yearn for, night and day. Go away, go away! - Let me sample the rich flavour... Mr. Wingate, Mr. Wingate, help! Mr. Wingate! Mr. Wingate, Mr. Wingate, help! I say, what's going on here? Why, is this your old woman then? - Well, no. Well, good. Oh, don't start that all over again. Duchess, would you like to tell me what all this is about? Mr. Wingate, this oaf followed me from the village and then started to molest me, I insist that you call the police. Well, I don't think there's any need for that. Now, if you'd like to just sit down and tell me your name. Hector, Hector Shaughnessy. I see and you live and work in the village, yes? Oh, no, I live up in the big house, no work for prizefighters around here. Here, you couldn't give me a job, could you? Well, I'm afraid I haven't any use for a prizefighter either. Unless, are you any good at PT? Nah, that's her game. I don't mean that sort of PT. I meant physical training. Yes, I sparred with all of them, Bruce Walker, Chubby Fowler, I swapped punches with the best of them. It's only too painfully obviously. Mr. Wingate, you're not serious? Well he might be useful and cheap. Now, look, Hector, if I take a chance on you, will you promise me one thing? To leave the Duchess here alone. - Faithfully, sir, faithfully. Just to be, just to be breathing the same air as her, just to be feeling the... Quite, quite. Now, you go off home, smarten yourself up, and come back here tomorrow morning at 9:00 and I'll give you your duties. Certainly, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. - Oh, and Hector? Yes, sir? Don't tell anybody in the village that you're working here, will you? Don't forget your condition of employment. My lips will be sealed. Our love shall remain a secret forever. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Thanks very much. Thank you, ma'am. Ooh. Thanks. Here they come, Fred. Look, my very first pupils. All right, girls, out you come. Master Giles, you should make a splendid headmaster of a girls' school. You think so, Fred? Now stay here, and don't move. I won't be long. Well I don't know about you, but I'm going to find Harry. Oh, Mr. Wingate? - That's correct. Could I have a word with you, sir? - Of course. In private, sir? Oh, yes, yes. Fred, would you go and take the girls' suitcases and put them upstairs in the bedrooms, and then when you've done that, bring the girls all downstairs into the main hall? Certainly, sir. After you. - Thank you. Now, Mr. Clapp, what can I do for you? Well, Mr. Berridge didn't say it was going to be like this, sir. You've had difficulties, Mr. Clapp? - Well... Tell me, why are all the girls undressed? They're a bunch of hooligans, sir. They tried to escape. I don't think I can do this very often. Nonsense, Mr. Clapp. When you see the lovely lolly that you're going to make, you won't be able to get those girls down here fast enough. The young ladies, sir. - Ah, show them in, will you, Fred? Certainly, sir. This way, ladies. Hmm. A most interesting bunch of girls. Mr. Clapp, will you? Oh, yes, sir, yes. This is Sally Reagan. She was probationed to me for two years for shoplifting, persistently. Naughty. You'll have to do better than that, won't you? This is Judy Arkwright. Third offence. Stole 140 pounds from an elderly gentleman, worked in a near beer joint. Oh, good work. Really good. This is Beth Villiers, involved in some sort of land fraud, I don't know much about it, I'm afraid. Excellent. You must tell me the details sometime. Is that all, Mr Clapp? I thought there were four girls. Oh, my god. Yes, the ringleader, Sue Randall. Where's Sue Randall? Well, Sue Ran, do you want to do a bunk for it now, or what? What's the point, Harry? You just become a girl on the run, and you'd cop it too for aiding and abetting. No, the best thing to do is to stick it out, and hope the police get hold of that swine, Ronny Lambert. If he's any decency at all, he'll clear me. Sue Randall? Sue Randall? There - Miss Randall. Sue Randall! Where are you? - Miss Randall, please. Come on, enough of the penny tricks! Where are you? 18 months for something you didn't do. I told you not to get mixed up with that Lambert crowd. Even I didn't know he was pushing acid in such a big way. You live and learn. Anyway, there was nobody else to get mixed up with. I was around. I was around all the time, but you didn't see me. Yeah, I know. Sue Randall! Sue Randall, where are you? You better go, Harry, you don't want to be found here. What for? I'm not doing anything wrong. I've been going straight for three years now. Well, at least you better get dressed. - Ah, give them a thrill. Sue Randall! Sue Randall! Where are you? There's no use trying to hide, we'll find you. Where are you? It's all right, Mr Wingate, I found her. You, young man, what do you think you're doing? I say, don't you feel a bit cold like that? Don't you think you ought to get dressed? I think you should allow me to punish them, sir. The girl should be spanked and the boy should be... Don't I know you? I thought I recognised something. Not you, the suit. Oh, yes, I remember. Lady Swithin's gardener. Same old story, made off with the silver, he was probationed to me. Now, look. I paid that debt, I'm straight now. Do you have a job? - No. Do you want one? - As a gardener? Well that would be your official capacity, but... Sleeping in? - Yes. In my room. Huh? No, just so that I can keep an eye on you. Okay. - Come on then. Fred, come on! - Coming, ma'am, er, sir. You four girls are the first pupils at Wingate Manor. Now, our object is to provide with an education that will enable you to take your place as leading members of our society. Mr. Wingate? - Yes? Could I ask you what were those contracts that you asked us to sign? Ah, yes, yes. I was just coming to that. Now, you will realise that the education that you will undergo here will be of a most unique nature. As such, it will be very expensive, but the benefits that you will reap as a result of this should be substantial. Of course, you will understand that I want the school to benefit as well. So, in fact, what you have done is just sign over one third of your future earnings to me. Now, I should like to introduce you to your teachers. Duchess. This is the Duchess of Burwash. Now, she will instruct you in a number of subjects, under the heading of technique. Good evening, girls. Hector? And this is Mr Shaughnessy... who will instruct in deportment. Pleased to meet you, girls. Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear. Two hours late, wouldn't surprise me if it was all steamed up. Oh, don't keep on at me, Ethel. How would you like to have walked six miles? Seems a bit funny to me. Wonder what they're all doing up Wingate Manor. You ought to find out, you know. Ah, I ought to, but I don't think Mr Wingate particularly welcomes me up there. Why not? You're only doing what you were paid to do. Well, I felt so guilty last time when I had to go up there and arrest him. Wingates have been in this county for centuries. So it's, I always feel they're above the law, those sorts of people. Why don't you just go up there and snoop around, without him knowing? Yeah, I think I will. Yeah. Probably nothing in it, but don't say nothing to anybody though. Oh, dear. - What's up? Mr. Roberts. - The Colonel? Oh, no, you didn't tell him? Mrs. Roberts was in the kitchen, I only mentioned it. Ethel, how many times have I got to tell you, especially the Colonel? You know he's daggers drawn with the Wingate family. Figures he ought to have been the squire of the village. Still, I'd dearly love to know what's going on up Wingate Manor. Yes, I think that's about right. Now this is your millionaire, and this is your dining room in the Carlton in Cannes. How do I get to Cannes in the first place? My dear, if you don't know how to get a one way ticket to the South of France, I don't know why we're bothering. I want you to play it by ear. Now, Fred, you know how to react? I'll do my best, ma'am. Right. Now, begin. Wiggle, dear, wiggle. Now look what you've done. It took me hours to dress, as well. Oh, my dear, I am so sorry. Allow me. No, no, that won't help, I shall have to go and change. Good, good. Oh, dear, my roommate has the keys and she won't be back for hours. What am I going to do? Excellent, excellent. It'd be my privilege to allow you to dress in my room. Oh, thank you, sir. Could I ask you to be so kind and come with me? Just in case one of the porters thinks I'm breaking in? Of course, my dear. - Marvellous. Very good indeed. Now comes the kill. Now this is your millionaire's room. There is the door, take up your positions, both of you. Harry, you're supposed to be hiding away behind the sofa. Sue, you'll come over here and join me. Now, enter. Come on, my dear. I'll wait in the bathroom while you undress. It doesn't matter, sir. I'm sure you've got daughters much older than me, and you're far too much of a gentleman. Quite, quite. - Why don't you sit down? Thank you, my dear. Tease him, dear. Tease him. Do you think I'm looking good. Marvellous. Very. Not at all bad. A bit corny perhaps, but still worth a good 5,000, according to the age of the punter. Fred, you all right? It's my heart, ma'am. Blood pressure, you know. Goodness, what's that? No, no, no, dear. Never make it appear as though it's vicious. Play on the punter's masochism. Start again. Get off, get off my back, get off my back, that's it. Now, sit on the side of the bed, all right? Now start from the top again, from the neck. Gently. Bigger, harder, deeper, that's it. Nice, nice. Down, down towards the ribs, down towards the ribs. Lovely. Harder, press, press, that's it, yes. Now, gently up towards the top of the neck again. Now, begin to work down the spine. Gently down the spine, now this is where you're lulling him into a sense of false security. Right down, right down, right down. Now, quickly, a couple of rabbit punches to the spine. That's it, lovely, and the ribs, that's it. Now, start on the left leg. The left leg. That's it. Massage gently, gently, you're lulling him again, that's it. He doesn't think anything's going to happen. Take it down to the knee, to the knee, that's it. Now, one hand under the ankle, grab it up, that's it, that's it. The submission hold, you've got it. That's it, darling, lovely. Everything okay up here, Mr. Wingate? Oh, yes. Judy's doing fine. All right, my dear, you can relax the leg, that's it. You go downstairs now and join Hector's class for PT. How's your Beth doing? Very good indeed. I've sent her out to Hector's class. Yes, he's doing very well. Open your legs up, put them right up behind your chest, come on. Right up. Now, ready, one, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. You look like an old bag of bones, Beth, hold them up, come up, stretch right up. Stand up, feet together. Stretch right up. One, two, down, up. Come on. Down, up, down, up, down, up. Down, up, down, up, come on. Down, up, that's it. Hands down by your sides. We're going right down to the ground this time, on each side of your feet. Hands above your head. One. Two, one, two. One, two. And pull to the chest, this'll swing them right out. Ready? One, two. Stretch up, Sue, put that tummy in, Sue. What are you laughing at? Put your tummy right in, hold your backside in. That's it. Hands above your head. Ah, good morning, Sergeant. Colonel Roberts, what brings you up here, sir? Well the wife told me there was something interesting going on, and I take it you're investigating. I'm not making no investigations, sir, just my routine rounds. You can't fool me, Sergeant. I know there's something fishy going on. That bounder Wingate ought to be locked up. Mark you, all the family were the same, you know, for generations. Now, now, Colonel, we can't run around making accusations like that. We've got to be sure of our facts. Well, that's as may be. I'm going to do a bit of investigation on my own. When I've got my facts, I'm going to pounce. Good day, Sergeant. Good day, sir. Now girls, an advanced class in a more difficult situation. This is the big killing, and you need far greater care. Young men obviously make the best husbands, unfortunately, they're always reluctant to pay for services rendered. So, we don't give it to them. Oh, I know all about this permissive age, but what they said in the '50s is true now, "once they've had you, they'll never marry you". So, now, Harry, I told you what to do, and Sally, you are just arriving at this young man's Chelsea flat. The object is to prevent him from seducing you. Now, go on, take up your positions. Dearly beloved, we are gathered together to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony. No, no, no, I'm a sick man. I'm a dying man, I'm a dying man, I tell you. I'm a dying man. Nonsense. Dearly beloved, we are gathered together to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony. Now, look, gals. If you can't get the old boy to the altar quicker than that, he's going to drop dead on you. Now, go back and start it all over again. Dearly beloved... I don't think we've got this quite right, have we, Sally? Come on, get dressed. We've got a lot of work to do yet. Now really bring them back, bring the chest right out. Ready? One, two, three. No, dear, I don't think we've got this quite right. You'll have to give him a little more passion, otherwise he'll lose interest. Try again. That's enough bloody passion. - Lay off. Oh! Aah! All right, girls. Mr. Wingate. Nice to see you again, Mr. Clapp. - Yeah, nice to see you. I've got a little something here for you, quickly. There we are, as promised. Thank you very much. - Right, see you again soon. Thank you, see you later. - Come along girls. Give your bags to Fred, will you? Take your case, madam? - That's right, straight down there. And yours. ...three, four, five, yeah, six. Beautiful. Damn nettles. Three months, Sergeant, three months! What are you going to do about this scandal? I don't see there's anything I can do, sir. I'd have to know a lot more about this. Have to know a lot more about it? Well, I'm going to whip up a petition. All right, sir, just as you like. Well, girls, this is it. You've been with us for three months now. It's time for you to go and face the outside world. I shall always hold very special place in my heart for you, my first, and I'm sure, my most successful pupils. I know that you'll capture the hearts of many unsuspecting males just as easily as you captured mine. Now, Hector will drive you to the station, from whence you will go your separate ways. Bravo, bravo. Goodbye, my dear. Go, do honour to your school. May God bless you all. Goodbye, sweetheart. Just take their money, don't marry any of them, huh? Don't worry, Harry. Look after yourself, see you soon. Come on, girls, or we'll miss the train. I got very attached to those girls. Ah, well, Duchess, let's bring in the newcomers. Now that we've got the introductions over, I think it'd be a good idea if you were to disrobe straight away. We have a very scientific approach here. This will enable your teachers to peruse your natural talents, and therefore, to give you the most beneficial and individual attention. What? Well, Duchess, I must say we've got a very nice bunch of girls this time. I believe they're even better than the last lot. Fred, you're supposed to be sweeping the floor. Yes, sir. Now, what about this one? '20s look, very nice, my dear. Confusing that, because this one's much more with it. This is absolutely present day, isn't it? You're right, you're right. - We can build up the colouring, I think. Oh, yes, yes. I think a little extra continental training for this one, don't you, Duchess? Should do very well on the Via Verrito? Reacts well, too. Oh, no. No. Hector? - Yes, sir. Do something about this, will you? - Yes, sir. Now you're going to work hard, you're going to do plenty of chest exercise, something like this. You try it. Now you're going to that a half hour every day, every day you've got to do that. Well, Duchess, if you'll just organise the contracts for the new girls. Of course. I think I'll be off to bed. - I'll be up later. Ethel? Hey, look, there's Wingate. - Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, we know all about him. Sergeant? Double faced blaggard. What are you going to do about him? Well there isn't anything I can do, sir, unless he breaks the law. Nearly 300 guests attended the wedding yesterday of London model Beth Villiers to Sheikh Abdul Eu-Balad-Al-Toto, the Kuwait oil magnate. Miss Villiers, looking charming and composed, told our reporter that her success on the international scene had been mainly due to the training she had received at the little known Wingate Manor Finishing School. By the way, we got a large check from her this morning. Oh, that's quick. I heard she fiddled the budget for her Crusoe. Yeah, I'm not quite sure that I like all this publicity. I mean, look at this thing in the paper yesterday about young Sally. Where are we? Oh, yes. "Sally Reagan, much in the news recently with her on/off/on romance with horror film producer Sydney Myers, has signed a seven year contract with a rival film company. It was reported that she negotiated the entire deal herself without any help from her agent. She added that her financial know-how had been acquired at Wingate Manor, an exclusive finishing school for girls". Then there was young Sue the other day, not content with her 20,000 pound settlement out of court from the defence minister, tells them that it was all due to us. She thought she was helping. I know, but it's... Give me just a minute. Yes? Principal, Wingate Manor, speaking. I'm sorry, madam, I'm afraid we're full. Say, you'll have to help me here, there's some woman, says she's read about us in the paper, she wants to send her daughter to us. Won't she take no for an answer? - No. Well, say we're full. Madam, I'm very sorry. Yes, I know money talks, madam... Well, 400 guineas a term? What? Very well, madam. That fixed her? - No, she's confirming in writing. I'll take this. Wingate Manor School for Girls, this is the deputy headmistress. I see. Well, I'm afraid we're full up. Ooh, well, eight or ten years, I should think. Hold the line a minute, I'll speak to the principal. I think this one's for you, it's Viscount Snow. In for a penny, in for a pound. 400 guineas a term. Will you confirm? Thank you, goodbye. I didn't actually think about this one. I hadn't envisaged this sort of problem. Perhaps you could burn the place down. Oh, daddy, what a super place. You will not forget the religious side of her education. Oh, good heavens, no, Bishop. We cater for every denomination here. I see. Come along my dears, this way. Straight through and up the stairs, there we are. In there, that's it. Ah, Mr. Wingate, I'll have to show you some interesting pictures of my daughter, when she was a little girl. Yes, I'd be most enchanted to see those. Oh, oh, yes. My, my. She has changed a lot, hasn't she? Quite a big girl now. Thank you, sir. See you again, goodbye. That should give you all you need. Sergeant, do your duty. Righto, sir. I'll have to phone the chief constable first though, sir. Right, I'll stay guard. It's the waiting I can't stand, Mr. Berridge. What does he want us for? Oh, stop fussing, Clapp. I've just seen the Home Secretary. First, Sally Reagan, making a fortune as a film actress. Then there's that, what's her name, Sue Randall with that cabinet minister scandal. You've no idea how I had to lie myself out of that one. Now there's this Beth Villiers, gallivanting all over Kuwait. These girls are supposed to be under lock and key. Well, no, no, sir. I mean, it's a very good school. I've only your word for that. I've never heard about this place and neither do I find now have any of my colleagues. Nevertheless, these girls are still on probation, Berridge. What are you going to do about it? Yes? Put him through. Speaking. Oh, no. All right. I suppose that's all you can do. Right, I'll phone you back. That was the Chief Constable. Reports from the local police that your Wingate Manor is a brothel. Oh, my god. Oh, no, sir. Not exactly a brothel, it's... Look, Berridge, you better get down there straight away. I'll do what I can to delay police action... but go on, man, hurry up and save your skin. Okay, sir. And mine. Right, quiet now, girls, please. Quiet. Now, today we have several new girls with us, so I thought we'd start with something cheerful. A party that is extremely popular in the European capitals, particularly in Italy, is one that is more generally known as the dolce vita orgy. Now, one point about this type of party, it is extremely difficult to tell the princes from the paupers. Well, the rich man from the poor. That will be the object of this lesson today. Everything all set, Sergeant? - Yes, sir. We caught the others as they were travelling through the village. Good, where are they? - Here, sir. Sergeant, what is the meaning of all this? Why are we being arrested? These people are all the same, you know. If there were no customers, there'd be no immoral houses. Immoral houses? What do you mean, sir? Don't come the old acid, sir, you know very well what's going on in there, and what's more, you're the patrons. If that's so, officer, what am I doing here? Madam, just because we're country folk, don't think we don't know all about big city perversions. No, no, no, no, no, girls. No, no, no, no, no. Now, look, I know he's got a big pectoral and all that, but he hasn't got any money, he's only the gardener's boy. Now I'm going to show you how to discern the ones with the money. Good gracious, Mr. Berridge, the police are here. Pull yourself together, Clapp. Come along, Sergeant, we're wasting time. Now, now, sir. Standing, you guard the prisoners, you two fellows come with me. Now then, Jenny, which of these gentlemen sitting here would you say was the millionaire? That one. And why do you say him? - Because he's fat. My dear, you don't necessarily have to be fat to be a millionaire. Now, what about our Frederick here? Wingate, quick. - Good heavens. The place is surrounded. You sit down. Clapp, have a seat, sit down. Just a minute, quiet. Aaaaah! Try and slip out of the window. Two faced blaggard. Giles Henry Rice Wingate, Hubert Robert Berridge, and Horace Clapp, you have been found guilty of conspiring to use the premises known as Wingate Manor for immoral purposes. I have listened very carefully to your defence, and learnt a lot from it. When I retire from the bench at the end of this month, I shall study this extraordinary case much more carefully, and benefit by it. Have you anything to say before I pass sentence upon you? Good. I am sending you... May I, please, your Honour? I would like to enter a plea of mitigation. Sit down and be quiet. I'm sending these men where they cannot be entering into any competition. I mean, where they will not be able to corrupt members of society. Now, you will each of you go the prison for a term of three years. Your Honour, I would like to take leave to appeal. Nonsense. We all adjourn for lunch. Don't worry, he can't do that. I'll get you out on appeal. I say, did you see that dirty look I gave him when he sentenced you to three years?
