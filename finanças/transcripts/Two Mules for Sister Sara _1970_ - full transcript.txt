Well, you look like you could use a shot of whiskey. Whiskey? Thank you. - Your mule? - Yes. No provisions, no canteen? Just how'd you figure on existing? I was confident the Lord would provide. Three more like them? He also provided you. - Which way you headed? - North. North, huh? Well, I'm headed south. So I'll just help myself to those ponies and be on my way. But, first we must cover them with stones. We can't leave without giving them a Christian burial of some kind. After the way they treated you, you feel like covering them? Of course. You got to be touched in the head. Do you have a shovel? Sister, raise your eyes to heaven. Now, are they or are they not God's creatures? But, of course they are. - Well, why do you want to rob them of all this convenient nourishment? Do you have a shovel? Yeah, it's on my packhorse over the hill.

You can probably travel along with them. Please help me. They're looking for me. Why? I was raising money for the Mexican army, and... and... I had to run in the middle of the night. Please! Lady, if you weren't a nun I'd let you save your own bacon. (SIGHS HEAVILY) All right, do as I say and act fast. Get rid of that cross, it shines like a mirror. You bring that last horse and follow me. Son of a bitch. What are you doing? I'm doing for you what... no Holy Virgin's in any position to do. Hah! We'll walk slowly so as not to stir up this stream bed any more than we have to. Why did you put that dead man on the horse? Because, a horse with a rider makes a deeper print than a horse without a rider. If we're lucky, the French will follow those ponies. Here. Eat this. I told you to eat something back there. Your stomach keeps growling, we'll have the whole French army on us. You know these little noises can only be heard a few feet away. Why are you so angry with me? What have I done? Well... maybe a nun ought not be so good-lookin'. The way I look is of no importance. I'm married to our Lord Jesus Christ. That's exactly what I'm steamed up about, Sister if you'll pardon my being frank. - I'm not offended, Brother Hogan. - Don't "Brother" me. Excuse me. Soldats, concentrez-vous de ce côté.

It's hard to believe that rattlesnake could taste so delicious. Hmm. Here. Ladies first. (SIPPING) Thank you. So you were headed north. Any particular place? I want to try to find a Juarista band, I'll be safe with them. - Where were you comin' from? - Chihuahua. - Chihuahua? You live there? - Mm-hm, for several years. - French garrison in Chihuahua. - Mm-hm, right next to the church. You wouldn't by any chance know how many soldiers in the garrison? - More or less you know? - About 200 and some cannon. How do you know all that? The French officers wanted to learn Spanish so my mother superior assigned the task to me, I also speak French. I went into the garrison three times a week. I hate them. Oh, how I hate them. - Ain't it a sin for nuns to hate? - Not if it's something evil. The French army killing and torturing the Mexican people, trying to force them to become one of their colonies. I hate them. - How big is the garrison? - Two stories. Years ago, it use to be a monastery. - It's one of those kind of buildings with an open patio? - A beautiful patio... - A balcony around the top floor and a staircase leading down? - That's right. You say it's next to a church. How far apart are they exactly? I don't know exactly, but in some places not more than ten or twelve feet. When you're the roof of the church, is the top floor of the garrison higher or lower? - Lower. Much lower. - Oh. - Sentries? - Day and night at the front gate. Sister Sara, you're gonna slow me up some, but I'll take you to one of those guerrilla bands you're lookin' for. - Do you belong to one of them? - Till I get paid, yeah. Paid? You mean in gold? Well let's put it this way, if they pay me off in tortillas, I'm gonna shoot 'em right in the eye. But the Juaristas are too poor to hire anybody. Well I made a deal to work out a plan to take the garrison. If it pays off, I get half the French treasury. Then you don't have any sympathy for their cause? Not theirs or anybody else's. See, I spent two years in a war in the States. Right now, all I'm interested in is money. If money is all you care about, then why did you fight in that war? Everybody's got a right to be a sucker once. - Mr Hogan. - Hmm? The 14th of July is a French holiday. By noon of that day last year the entire French garrison was drunk. - What's the date today? - July the 6th. Beautiful. That information puts gold right in my pocket. This calls for a drink. Well, I'll be leaving you for a few moments. Well, be careful not to go too far, there may be another rattler. I'll pray as I walk. I'll keep my back turned. Don't worry.

No, thanks. - Must be a lonely life. - It's a great life. Women when I want 'em and none with the name of Hogan. How about you, ma'am? Haven't you ever wanted to be a whole woman? Have a man make love to you? Have children? I've chosen a different way of life. What about those feelings your god gave every woman, including you? - You know I've always wondered about that. - Well, we're human, of course. When we get those feelings, we pray until they pass. In your case, just how much praying does that take? What about before you became a nun? Did you ever have a man? No. - Ever been kissed by one? - No. Haven't you ever laid awake wondering what it would be like? No. All the women I've ever met were natural-born liars but I never knew about nuns till now. You're right. I lied. I'll say one thing, Sister. I sure woulda liked to have met up with you before you took to them clothes and them vows. HOGAN: That limp's getting worse. Stone bruised. It'll take a week for that to heal up. Well maybe the people in this village will hide you out until this animal comes around. Why couldn't I ride the packhorse? Because, he carries my equipment, that's why. I ain't gonna miss bein' in Chihuahua on the 14th. - Please, Brother Hogan... - Look, I told you not to "Brother" me. All right, Mr Mule. You were right. You are as stubborn as my mule. When we get up to that village, Sister, then I'll say adios. This is where we part company. - Now what are you doin'? - I must say a prayer at this shrine. You said your prayers last night and this morning. You're going to wear them out. It's a sin to pass a shrine without praying. - Not if you shut your eyes. - Please, Mr Hogan. All right, it's a small shrine, let's make it a small prayer. Buenos dias, hermana. You see, Mr Hogan, what a little prayer can do? The Lord provided a kind gentleman who accepted my mule for this creature of God. Now I can still be with you. Your mule for that burro?

They're waiting for a train due today for Santa Maria so they can load it with supplies and ammunition. Well, you did all right, Sister. Between here and Santa Maria there's got to be a gorge.

Mr Hogan, you should be happy you're still alive. What do you want from your life anyway? A ranch? Cattle? What do you want? A ranch? You mean get up at sunrise, go to bed at sunset? Rear end in the saddle all day? No, thanks, Sister, I'd rather be dead. No Sister, there's this town called San Francisco that's booming. And if I get this stake, Well, I'm gonna open up myself the biggest gambling saloon in the whole area with long, red mahogany bars and green felt tables and we'll play roulette, dice, faro and all those wonderful games. I realize that doesn't mean much to you but to me, that's living. Some men have strange desires. - Where the hell's your father? - Señor, he is sick. Enfermo. It's important I see him. Where is he? Since three days now, he cannot talk. All this side, no move. - Does he understand when you speak? - Sí, señor. Does he understand English? Not so good like me but... my mother, she with him. Un memento. Madre! [Just a moment. Mother!] (DOG BARKING IN THE DISTANT) He no can speak. - May we see him? - Bien, hermana. Please to come. (DOG BARKING IN THE DISTANT) Francisco.

You get me a bottle of tequila and I'll lay you out a plan as smooth as a baby's behind. You tell me the plan, I will tell you how smooth it is. BELTRAN: The roof of the garrison is lower than the roof of the church and on the 14th of July you have promised us, Sister, all the Frenchmen will be drunk. Not bad, Hogan. Not bad. Thank you, Sister. Yeah, we make quite a team. In fact, If we pull this off, we might go in the garrison business again, right Sister? If we follow what you did to the train by capturing the garrison, - all of my people will take heart. - How many men do you have? 40, but there'll be more by the time we reach Chihuahua. - How many more? - 50 to 60. I thought you were a colonel of the Mexican army. I am. Any army I ever heard about, a colonel commands a full regiment. Yes, and a parade but not after all the fighting we've been through. You know when you got me into this thing, you told me you had no artillery. - What about dynamite? You have any? - None. Less than a hundred rifles, a few machetes and not much more. Even drunk, the French'll blow your heads off. You don't know my men. Each one tough, courageous, a Mexican patriot. Mmh Isn't that sweet? But I happen to be a Hogan patriot and I'd like to have some dynamite working with me. I will welcome all you can get, you show me the tree it's growing on, I'll have my men pick it. Probably plenty for sale across the border in Texas. Yeah, but that takes money. Even the food you ate and that bottle were donated to us. Bien. We leave for Chihuahua tomorrow. You can come with us and fight under my orders, my way, or go back to that Texas bar that I found you in. I'm in on this deal and no son of a bitch is taking me out of it. If any other bastard spoke to me like that, he would be dead. But since you have helped Mexico, I am giving you a chance to get on your horse and leave this camp alive. - Now get out of here fast. - I ain't leavin' here. Colonel, please. This ring, it's gold. It'll buy dynamite. Perhaps some of your people have other things that could be sold. If someone shows me back to Santa Maria, I'll go from house to house tonight begging for help. Dynamite would save the lives of some of my men. I told you I was staying in this deal, Colonel, cuz you know nobody over in Texas is gonna sell a load of dynamite to a Mexican. I am asking you, buy dynamite for us. I'd love to. Oh, Sister. You better sew this back on. You don't want to have those people see you going around half-dressed.

Well, I'll just see you in Chihuahua. Right. If we take the fort, we'll owe ourselves a celebration. I might even put a little whiskey in your lemonade.

Alright, listen, I think I know how we can get a in surprise. Three streets from here there is a house. It use to be the residence of the bishop. To protect him in the rainy season there was a tunnel. It led from the house to the garrison when it used to be a monastery. And after the bishop moved, the monks built a wall, closing it up. I think you can break through. - Who lives there now? - Very good friends of mine. - Trustworthy? - Yes. Very trustworthy. Good, I got something that'll work. - What? - Fire. Hey, when you were giving those Spanish lessons, you ever get a peek at where they kept the garrison money? They used to pay me from a strongbox in the general's office. Second floor in that building there. HOGAN: Now was it iron or wood? SARA: Iron. Great. That means it won't burn. Now, I figure we separate your men into four groups, giving them coal oil and dynamite, and let the first group hit that main gate. Have the second group go through that tunnel she is talking about and busting into the courtyard. And the third group hit that gate over there. The fourth group, the fourth group made up of your best riflemen, we'll have right up here. They can pick off the sentries and set fire to the garrison. Of course this all has to happen at the same time. First we shall wait for the cover of night. - Alright.
