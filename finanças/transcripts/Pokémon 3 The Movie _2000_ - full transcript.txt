SubRip-Fixes by VaVooM There are many Pokemon in the world that nobody's seen yet, and are known only from legends. This book has many such Pokemon, drawn from the author's imagination. The one you're searching for is this one, right? Yes. Papa's been always looking for the mysterious Pokemon, "Unknown". I... I like this one here. The Pokemon of Illusion, Entei. Me's favourite. Entei's strong and kind, just like you, Papa. Papa's like Entei, huh? I hope so. All right! Papa's Entei! It's Entei! All right, let's go! A mail? It's probably for you. You should hurry and look at it. This is John. Boss, we found clues relating to Unknown in the ruins. Please come as soon as possible. Clues relating to Unknown? I figured you'd have to go to work. Sorry, Me. I'll be back as soon as I can. Papa... Good night, Me... It's here, Dr. Sully. This writing's unlike anything we've seen before, but it's safe to assume it's about Unknown. Incredible. You're likely the only one who can make any sense of this. What's... The Unknown... Boss? Boss? Dr. Sully? Doctor! The young miss is truly alone now... Are you back, Papa? Me-chan... Young miss... Papa... Did you send me mail? Unknown? Papa... Are these for me? I feel lonely, Papa... Unknown... Wanna play with me? What's... - Young miss! - Those are Unknown! Hey! Papa... Papa... come back... Were you the one who called me? Entei? I am... Entei. Papa... You're Papa, right? You became an Entei and came back, Papa! Papa... I am Papa... If that is your wish. Away from his home in Masara Town, Satoshi and his friends aim to enter the Johto League. Their journey continues today. You're a Pokemon Trainer, right? Yeah. I'm Satoshi, from Masara Town. I want to be a Pokemon Master. I'm Takeshi, miss. What's your name? I'm Lynn. Well? Want to battle? Well? What are you gonna do, Satoshi? Obviously, it's common courtesy to accept a battle! Thanks. Show me your power as a Trainer! OK! Let's battle! OK! OK! Let's move on! OK! Together, we'll be all right! OK! Though the wind's changing OK! That dream won't! Up 'til now, we've been going on in a daze and although we hadn't noticed The key to the door leading to the new world is in getting something unknown Golden Smile and Silver Tears Delight and frustration are always changing faces and making everyone stronger! OK! Follow mel! OK! If we cry out in triumph, we can't lose! OK! Even if we break through the wall OK! This journey won't end! Though I'd begun to give up there was no reason to do so The morning sun burns brightly on my journey and asks me "that much is fine, right?" Golden Sun and Silver Moon The sun and moon are always changing faces and protecting everyone! Therefore... OK! Swallow your fear! OK! A prideful move, "Bravado!" OK! Though I don't know their names or voices They're waiting for me! I'll face them some clay! Let's go! OK! Open the next door! OK! A prideful move, "Recklessness!" OK! We cry and laugh together My friends are fine! I believe in my friends! OK! You guys are pretty strong. We've gotta train more. No, we had some trouble too. This was your 5th fight this week. Aren't you tired? Yeah... Lynn-san, would you happen to know where the nearest Pokemon Center is? There's one just past this forest, in Greenfield. By "Greenfield", you mean... The place known as the number one vacation spot for girls in Johto? Bingo! I'm going there too. Greenfield... A green field of peace. The wind that blows through it can calm the hearts of both people and Pokemon. I want to go there at least once! The number one vacation spot for women. Lots of girls... Greenfield"s just past that hill. It's a good thing we chased Pikachu all the way here. We reached the sought-after Greenfield, but... what's this? Green? More like light. So is this some sort of treasure? Pearls before swine. Or somethin' like that... - That's right! - Sonansu! You came out on your own again? Get back in there. Junsa-san... - Ready? - OK. - Can you hear me? - Yes. 3... 2... 1... Greenfield, a town known for its lush green, has been turned into a deep and dark atmosphere, which not even 100 soldiers can penetrate. We believe this may be related to the disappearance of Prof. Sully Snowdon, but we cannot confirm it. Sully Snowdon? Dr. Sully was known throughout the world for his research on legendary Pokemon. Wasn't Dr. Sully one of your students, Dr. Okido? He was indeed a splendid student. On that note, I was sent his article in a mail... - Those are... - Unknown. Unknown? Dr. Okido, have you seen what's on TV? Just saw it. I was just about to go over to the scene. I'll go too! You knew Sully-kun too, didn't you? His daughter's still very little, so I'm worried. Got it. Go get ready to leave. Yes. Those taking action have just arrived at the Greenfield Pokemon Center. We've been waiting for you, Dr. Okido. Doc... Oh, Pikachu! - Mom! - Oh, Satoshi. - What? You guys are here, too? - It's been a while, Dr. Okido. I figured you'd come. - I see you've been doing well, Satoshi. - You too, mom. Papa... I want a Mama, too... If that's what you wish, Me. Long ago, Dr. Sully used to study under Dr. Okido. Didn't you say he used to help you with your homework? Yeah. He visited Masara Town a few times since... I see, it was him back then. That's Dr. Sully's house. I'm really worried. Geez... What's wrong, Pikachu? What? A Pokemon? It's the first time I've seen one of these. Who are you? Mama... You are... Mama. You are Mama! I am... Mama... I am... Mama. Hey, wait! Mom, Pikachu! Get lost! Pikachu, you all right? Don't go, Satoshi! You don't know what's in there! Why? Why mom? I brought her... The one you wished. Mama... Mama! I am... Mama... Mama, it's me, Me. Me... Mama... Now I can be with Papa and Mama forever. Yes. If that is what you wish. Your world keeps growing. It's pretty... If you're happy, then I'm happy. The Pokemon that kidnapped Satoshi's mom? That's Entei. Entei? It's known only from legends. There's one more thing about this case. Another mysterious Pokemon. You mean Unknown, right? Then one you've been researching. Unknown is within these ruins... I see... It's as I thought. Eyewitnesses on Greenfield, the source of the crystalisation, state that the legendary Pokemon Entei has kidnapped a woman. - Mama! Wait! - However, details are still unknown for now. We are broadcasting live as a bulldozer is being called to break through the crystals! You can't! Don't destroy it! Dr. Sully's disappearance, this mysterious crystalisation. Even Entei's appearance. All of this was caused by the Unknown. There doesn't seem to be any other possibility. A mail? Papa and Mama came back to me. I'm happy. I want things to stay as they are! Nobody come in! Me-chan... She must be safe, since she could send me a mail... But it's odd. Isn't her dad missing? Yeah. And by "Mama... " It's puzzling. Your back's so big, Papal - Having fun? - Yeah. I can't wait for them to solve the puzzle! Will you come with me, Pikachu? Wait, Satoshi! I'll go, too! Don't leave me behind! Kasumi, Takeshi... What...? Satoshi-kun, take that Pokegear with you. Lynn-san... You might as well have a way to communicate with the Pokemon Center, right? I'll tell Dr. Okido about it for you. Thanks. Water doesn't seem to crystalise... Yeah, so if we follow the river, we should reach the Snowdon home. Those guys never give up. Aiming for outer space, we're Team Rocket! Going from above is better than from below. And our goal is the castle's treasure! This rocks! What? - Isn't that the thing we saw on TV? - Entei, right? This suc... Isn't it cruel to dump us like this so suddenly? Well, we managed to get in... But what is this place? There doesn't seem to be any treasure here. Besides, you'd keep a treasure with you constantly. - Then the treasure's in that tower? - But how would we get there? We have to go down, then back up... Going down and up again... - Isn't there an elevator? - Of course there ain't one. Who was that? Nobody. We're the only ones here. We can see our house in there, Mama! - Isn't it pretty? - Yes... Something resembling a flame was just spotted above the Snowdon home, but we can't confirm it. The rescue squad's set to arrive tomorrow morning, but... Hm? Is that a... Pokemon? All right, Fushigidane and Chicorita. Use Vine Whip! Togepy, stay still for a while, okay? Satoshi? What do you think you're doing? Um, actually... It looks like someone's trying to get in our home... Satoshi... - That's too dangerous! - What is, mama? Nothing... The thing on his back is a Pikachu, right? Ah! He has a Fushigidane and a Chicorita, too! Is he a Pokemon Trainer, Mama? Yeah... Maybe he has other Pokemon, too! Right, Papa? Papa? Good work, guys. Thanks to you too, Fushigidane and Chicorita. You really came through for us! Are you guys all right? Lynn-san? Satoshi, you were just on TV! Sorry, Dr. Okido. But I... I'm not going to tell you to come back when you're already there. Just save your mom and hurry back! Right. Satoshi-kun, this is John. Did you see any Unknown? - Not yet. - I see. According to Dr. Sully's research, Unknown can sense the feelings of others. What do you mean? They can sense the feelings in the hearts of humans, and turn them into reality. The feelings in the hearts...? The Unknown are reacting to what they're feeling from Me-chan's heart. I'm sure that crystal tower was created from the Unknown reacting to her heart! Hinoarashi, Flamethrower! All right! One more time, Flamethrower! - Good job, Rokon! - All right, let's swap fighters! Water Gun! All right. Now, Pikachu. Let's go, guys. Hitodeman, good work! Great job, Waninoko. What? Is this the power of the Unknown? The one that Dr. Okido warned us about? Probably. Either way, we've got to keep moving! What's going on? It's the world that the Unknown created from Me-chan's heart! This is... Ouch, oww! And here I thought we'd finally reached the bottom... Are these Pokemon? I dunno, but we're better off not goin' near things we know nothin' about! Well, yeah, but we have to go through here to reach the other tower! Then we'll just have to sneak by! - Quietly... - Quiet steps... - Stealthy steps... - Soft steps... - Quiet steps... - Stealthy steps... Looks like the guy from before and his friends got inside the house. Should I kick them out? I want to face them in a Pokemon battle! - But can I do it? - You can. If that is what you wish. That's right! I can do it! I'm still little, but... When I grow up... I can do it, right? This is the first time I've been in a Pokemon battle! You can do it, Me. I can do it, right? Entei? You're Pokemon Trainers, right? What about it? Want to battle? I don't know who you are, but I don't have the time right now. You're so boring. Hey, Entei! Where'd you take my mom? Only me and my parents are here! - That's right. - What? Satoshi... Your name is Me, right? Oh, you know who I am? Me-chan's supposedly much smaller than that! This is Me-chan's world, as created by the power of the Unknown. That girl can make anything. And she can be anything! No way... Are we gonna battle or not? All right! - I'll be your opponent, miss! - All right. Takeshi? Entei came from up there. So your mom should be there, too. Let's go, Satoshi. Finding your mom's our first priority! Let's go, Pikachu! We'll use three Pokemon. You're free to switch out at any time. Understood. Go, Zubat! I'm counting on you. Mokoko, go! Zubat, use Supersonic! It's working! Zubat, Wing Attack! Here it comes! Dodge it! Good job! Here it comes again, use Headbutt! Now! ThunderShock! Return, Zubat! You did your best... We did it! That was amazing, Mokoko! The match just started. Go, Rokon! Then here. How about this one? A Himeguma, huh? A cute Pokemon for a cute lady. It's not just cute. DynamicPunch Himeguma, Explosive Punch! Quick Attack Rokon, Lightspeed Strike! Himeguma, Fury Swipes! Pokemon created from Me-chan's heart... They're not just for show... they're strong! Soft steps, quiet steps... Is there really a treasure in a place like this? What are you on about? We can't go back empty-handed now! Return, Rokon! - You're pretty strong! - You too. But I'm training to become the world's #1 Pokemon Breeder! A Trainer needs to raise his Pokemon well. Good point. You're right! Yeah, that smile! That's a nice smile! You're a strange one. Gomazo, Rollout attack! Just because it's small doesn't mean you should let your guard down! Is this picture book yours? Yeah. - Papa read it to me all the time... - I see... You can have it if you want, Mama... Me-chan, have you always been alone? Did you feel lonely? A little... But it's all right now. Mama and Papa are here... So, who's gonna battle me now? Then, Takeshi... Me will never lose. Is Entei an illusion too? - I want to battle a stronger Trainer. - What? - Leave this to me, Satoshi. - And you are? The world's most beautiful girl, Kasumi! At one point, I was to be Hanada Gym's Leader! - You're a Gym Leader? - Don't look down on me. You don't have to be an adult to be a Gym Leader? You can do it. You can do anything. That girl's real body is probably with your mom! Hurry up to where she is! I'm from Hanada Gym, so I'll be using Water-types! Then I'll use Water-type Pokemon, too. I see. You can do anything here, huh? Let's battle! Here I go! Kingdra, please! Go, My Steady! All right! Use Headbutt now! Tosakinto, Fury Attack! Tosakinto, you did your best... We did it, we did it! This one's next. Not bad. This makes no sense. Don't think about boring logic, just act! Aimin' for outer space, we're Team Rocket! Just keep aimin' higher! Or somethin' like that. Tackle! Mantine, Whirlpool! He's trapped! Bubble Beam! Hitodeman, Rapid Spin! - Well? - Amazing! Take Down Mantine, Charge attack! Hitodeman, Tackle! This is fun! This is so fun! Seeing you laugh makes me happy. Thank you, Papa. Satoshi... - Are you all right, Mom? - I'm fine. But you're still risking yourself as much as always. It's because I'm your son. Me-chan? And the Unknown? Aren't they here? If you mean the Pokemon that brought me here, he left a while back. That was Entei. This tower and Entei were created from Me-chan's heart, by the Unknown. No way... Either way, we've got to leave. Right. Wake up... Wake up, Me-chan. What's wrong, Mama? Listen, Me-chan. I'm not your real mother. I'm Satoshi's mama, not yours. Do you remember me, Me-chan? We met in Masara Town. Please, come with me. Mama... You can't stay here! No... No... No! Mom... Mom! - Are you OK, Mom? - Yeah... Over here, mom! What's wrong, Me? Papa, that boy wants to take Mama away! - Satoshi! - Mom! Mom! Leave her and go! I'd never do that! She's my mother! She's Me's mother here. - You don't get to decide that! - Get out. If you don't leave on your own, I'll make you leave! We'll see about that! Waninoko, I choose you! - You intend to defeat me? - I won't lose to an illusion! Waninoko, Water Gun! I'm an illusion, you say? Nonsense! Return, Waninoko! If water won't work, let's try fire! Go, Hinoarashi! Hinoarashi, Flamethrower! Return, Hinoarashi! He's strong... Do you still think I'm an illusion? You're an illusionary Entei created by that girl's heart! No... No! I'm an illusion, you say? I'm... I am... This girl's father! Pikachu! Pikachu! Me-chan, do you remember? Your real papa and mama? Me-chan! We made it! Here too? - A battle? - With us right in the middle... Pikachu! Lizardon! You came, Lizardon! Thank you! Satoshi! Are you all right? What is he? - My friend. - Friend? My Pokemon are all friends that I made during my journey! Friends...? It doesn't matter how many you have! - We too... - ... are your friends! Takeshi! Kasumi! I'm gonna say this before you ask "What's that?" - Musashi! - Kojiro! And Nyarth! We're your friends from Team Rocket! Team Rocket? Why are you...? Actually... Somehow... ...our hands just reached out. We've been around each other for a while. Come on, Me-chan. Come with us. My friends are here! Go away! Lizardon! Papa! Do you really think you can be Me-chan's real father? As long as she wishes it, I will be Me's father! Me! Lizardon, Flamethrower! One more time, Lizardon! Papa! Lizardon, Fire Spin! Entei, please! Listen to me! If you really care about Me-chan, then listen to me! You can't stay here with that girl! It's just wrong! Even if it is wrong, I will grant Me's wishes! Lizardon! If you keep her here, she'll always be alone! Lizardon... This is the end! Stop it! Stop, Papa... No more! No more! I lost to you, Me-chan. Your Gomazo's Rollout was really strong! Your Mantine's Whirlpool, too! You could be a Gym Leader one day! After a battle's over, those of us who love Pokemon... We're all friends. Let's go outside. - Even if you fight when outside... - You can make friends. Lots of them. Let's go, Me-chan. It's warm... Papa? I became your father to make you happy. If your happiness lies in the outside world... I... - Wha...? - What now? This way! Lizardon, take care of Me! Hang in there! Everybody hurry! - What's going on, doc? - It's the Unknown! They can't stop their power now that it was unleashed! The crystalisation's even spreading here! Satoshi, you have to stop the Unknown from running wild! The crystalisation's spreading further! Even the Pokemon Center's being engulfed by crystals! Run away! - Y-Yes! - Hurry! These are the Unknown... How do we stop them? There's a barrier protecting them! Lizardon, you go! We did it! I'm counting on you, Pikachu! Thunderbolt 100.000 volts! Are you all right, Pikachu? This is really bad! There ain't no treasure here, let's go home! Guess you're right... Excuse us... We're blocked! Somebody do something! Please stop, Unknown! Me. I'm glad... That I got to be your father. The last thing I can do for you... ...is to get you out of this place! I was born from your dreams. So if you believe in it, there's nothing I can't do. Papa...! Me... Me! Me, you have to believe in Entei! That your Entei can't lose! Good luck, Papa! Me... Me! Me... Me! Papa... Thank you for calling me Papa. I'll go back to your dreams. Papa... - This is the real... - Greenfield! It's beautiful! Hey, is everybody safe? Dr. Okido! Thank you... Let's go meet them, Me-chan. Everybody was worried about you! - Come on. - Yeah! Me-chan! Young miss! Well? What do we do now? The police are down there. We can't go down... That's right! Sonansu! In any case... That's one less lonely girl! But there's another in here! A young lonely girl. Musashi! A young, lonely man. Kojiro! Next one's always alone! Me, as the wind blows in Greenfield! Even if you're alone, we're your friends! Whatever the reason... This rocks! Before long, the rain will stop falling. Someday, the clouds will disappear. Lift your face, and you should hear my voice calling you Since shining tears point to a smile Someday, someone will be given wings for this sadness Rub your cheeks, let the sunlight rain on you You remembered to smile, right? You've replied o someone's voice with it, right? Since a small smile points to happiness One day, you'll be wrapped up in that pleasure. When you get wings that make sadness go away, a rainbow is born From a lonely color towards a warm color. This is the gradation of feelings Anywhere there's a warm glow... What's real solitude actually like? There's nothing to say, since you should already know...
