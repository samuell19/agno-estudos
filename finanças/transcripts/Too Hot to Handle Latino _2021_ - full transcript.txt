I want to see how the party's going too. But first, I need to explain something. As an influencer once said, "Big things are coming." They're about to get the green light. It's gonna shock us for being horny. The private suite will be inaugurated. You'll have to sleep together. Some will say goodbye. Really? Lana's allies will arrive to shake up the relationships in the house. What's that? A catastrophe. And it is on! My turn now! NARRATED BY: ITATÍ CANTORAL You misbehaved. You misbehaved with me. My turn to misbehave with you. If you keep screaming, I'll hit you like this. - Smack the cutest ass here. - Okay? - Doesn't hurt. - Harder! - Doesn't hurt? - No. Harder! I went crazy. The harder he hit me, the more I laughed. Just don't laugh so hard you pee in your pants 'cause leather is uncomfortable, so they say. I'm gonna ride you like a horse, like this. - Mm... - Mm? Like that? So you want me to ride you? That was a real temptation, but... ...I resisted like a man. No, no, I don't trust her. I can't take this anymore. Please, turn green! Sweetie, close your eyes. Manuela is making Flor's legs tremble like Bambi's. It's like a porno in real life. I have my Flor and Manu, both adorable little things. I can't finish, that's the problem. Give me the green light! But you're about to turn red. Oh, you meant the watch. One's dominating the other, and I'm just watching. Incredible. I'm going crazy. Untie me! They had to tie down Locho because he wants to get his guitar. Whoo! - Softly. - Of course. - Really soft. - It's gonna hurt, but you'll like it. Sounds like Arjona. They're all crazy, crazy. Joel's pitched a tent so it's probably better that he sit down for a chat. You look... so hot. You look so sexy. You look so slutty in that outfit. That's the point. And hitting you, spanking your ass, your legs... - Concentrate. - And you ask for more... And that's why you want Lana to turn on the green light. No. I want her to give us the green light because I really want to kiss you, regardless of everything else. I love all the chemistry we have together. Outside of the sex thing, I'm enjoying all this. I'm enjoying you, your company... - ...you just shooting the breeze. - ...just joking around. You get me out of my... my bubble, that I've been in. I need some water to put out this fire inside me! Ay! There are boners everywhere. After all this foreplay, we're bound to see some slip-ups. I'm watching you. Oh my God! Things are getting hot! I hope everything isn't red tomorrow morning, their legs, their backs, their accounts. Look, I don't know if our horny singles did anything they regret, but those faces make me think someone went too far. What will Lana say? Lana called us for an announcement. I have a knot in my chest. Uh, literally a knot. Don't breathe too hard or you'll undo it. It feels like bad news is coming. There's a silence like, "You don't know what you're in for." Now what, Lana? How can we help? Who broke the rules? Who did what? Every time we get together like this, Lana says, "Someone broke the rules." - Someone broke the rules. - Who broke the rules? Tell the truth. Honestly... - Hello, mortals. - Hi! Last night was a big test for you. And I want to congratulate you. No one broke the rules. Yes! We have to work hard and save some money. No one broke the rules? Things really are changing on this retreat! No one broke them. I don't know if we're in for another present or... I have some news. I'm worried. I don't know what's coming. Creating deep connections is one of the most important goals of the house. Some, like Israel, look to get deeper than others. Nice and deep, baby. Come on, it's all about depth with you, but whatever. There's money to spend. - Whatever! - How much do you want? You already cost us like 9,000 dollars. This is BS. Lana, could you give these two the green light, so they can duke it out? I'm not going to be broke. The goal is to learn to connect deeply with each other without the need for sex. Agreed. My data shows that two people haven't been as involved in the process as the others, so I have made a decision. Manuela. Dadvian. This is over for you. Say your goodbyes. Aw. Really? No! No way. We loved each other. I feel like I'm not really being myself. ♪ I've been feeling ghostly... ♪ I don't want you to leave. I'm feeling sad because I wanted to get to know them more. Dadvian, cheer up! Now you can show your piercing to whoever, whenever. There are no words. I'm just speechless. How... I mean, I can't believe this is happening. - Bye. - Bye! - We love you. - Bye, guys! - We love you! - We love you. I was like... Remember, the process by which your behavior is analyzed is based on romantic connections. Good luck. The Manuelita bird flew away. Israel is that uncle who tells jokes at funerals. ♪ Caught in a chain reaction... ♪ Since everyone is feeling down, Israel decided to keep stoking the flame with Dahiana. - Has it been hard for you? - No, I understand now. Yeah? - Fast, huh? - Yeah. I learned the dynamic. Okay, I lost money. We kissed. I played the game. It's a bit hard, of course, because I had some ideas in mind. But then Lana tells us, "You can't do that here." And it's like... There has to be mischief, right? More than what you've done already? I have to remember he's not my boyfriend. We're just friends, we're having a good time. I don't care. He can do whatever he wants. I don't regret it, do you? It's a good time, right? Yeah. I had a great time. - It was good. - What's left to do? I'm trying to behave. Lana, stop giving me so many temptations, please. Fuck it. Fuck the 100,000. Lana, can we use another watch to shock Israel when he's horny? Gotta keep some money. Workshops always teach them something new, but some of them also get them really hot. Today, Lana has prepared one of those workshops. While sex is prohibited during the retreat, it is still important to understand the different expressions of sexuality and to know the limits of each. Diana and Francisco holding hands. That's gossip I didn't know. In this workshop, the participants will discover the different types of sexuality, the sexuality of earth, of water, of fire, and of air. Lana, why would you give bread to the toothless? - Hey! - Hi! - What's up? - How are you? What's up, guys? Is everything all right? You okay? Francisco's great, and next to him is a girl who is... ...sweet candy, as we say in Argentina. Let's start with earth. What's the sexuality of earth? Fire on one side, water on the other, like Pokémon. Looking at them, what kind of sexuality do you like? Strong. Strong, wild. It defines me perfectly, and that's how I am in bed. What's "sexuality of air" like? - Feelings, creativity... - Feelings, kissing, and rough at the end. Exactly! That's great! Touch, feel, vibe with your partner. And that's me. I don't know, Nick. Remember the last time you had sex? So, vibing with your partner... Not really. I'm good at faking it. I'm sure that after this workshop you'll achieve a truly deep connection. My God! Let's pair up, okay? It's in pairs! No wonder Francisco and Diana came together. Let's see what Lana has in store to match up these ready-to-explode volcanoes. Flor. Nico. Zaira. Nick. Isra. Dahiana. Destiny separated us. Why does he hate me? What did I do? Caro. Locho. I'm with Carolina. Nice. Let's connect. But inside I'm like, "Yes!" If we are interacting and something takes me to my limit, I can say "red." If I say "red," we stop, okay? Now, let's talk about our red lines. What parts of your body do you not want them to touch? Don't hit my balls. I don't like things like fingers in my ass. I don't want you to touch my vagina because we can't and I don't want you to touch me there. If you see me getting a boner and we're being filmed, cover it up. It's kind of embarrassing. Why don't you show us what to do? Because this group needs clear examples. I'm just going to get worked up. Okay, we get it. Your turn, little bunnies. Whenever you want. They're getting into the rhythm and other things too. Boom-chaka-boom-chaka-boom. It was inevitable, you know? Whoo! Water is sensual, oily, sexy, delicious, romantic. Passion, grazing, tongue... Ugh! I'm excited! It's getting me really hot. I'm going crazy. It's a good thing this workshop won't be deducted, so Isra and Dahiana are exploiting it. Great. So great. It's a good experience. I look over, and they're smelling each other. Why is this happening to me? I hate them! It doesn't look like you're having a bad time either, Caro. - This has got me going. - Stop! Locho was going to be the ace up my sleeve to get back at Isra for what he did, but we just don't click. - Let's move to fire. Dominate. - Fire! Thrust! Get everything out. What are you doing to me? You can smell the tension. Heat's rising, the moment on top. Emotions are high. Hard! Spank it! Red! Red, red! Red! I shout "red" because I can't take it. Now, come close to each other, and start experimenting with the energy of air. Shouldn't there be air between them first? Physical activity is tied to letting emotions out, which allows you to sincerely communicate what's inside. That sensation of wanting to kiss each other... ...but we can't. I loved it when you spanked me. Isn't love sweet? I felt a transparency looking in your eyes. I could see myself. I felt it in my heart, and it felt amazing. We need to break the pattern of, "I'm only water." Play with all the elements. That way, couples don't lose their love and desire over time. There's always variety. So, good communication, creativity, and getting out of your comfort zone, guys, that's what we wanted to leave you with. Thank you. - Thank you. - Thanks! Thank you, everyone. Lilian and Joel connected on a deeper level in the workshop, but it still wasn't enough to let her guard down. I want to get to know Joel in a lot of different ways, not just... Here. Truth is, I'm afraid of getting hurt, or finding out that my feelings are just a result of being here. Who do you think I am? Tell me. You're one of those players, like in soap operas. I don't know. It's easy for you. I have the face of a prick. It's not my fault. I know a few of those. That's why I said I'm having a good time with you because... you're... different. What? - Come here. - It was a magic moment. Back to the soap opera. She cries easier than Sally Fields at the Oscars. - He's becoming really important to me. - I know this will work. There's so many things that we share, that we both like and that... - Without trying. - And I like how things are going. It's not just about... the sex. If that green light doesn't turn on, I'll stop believing in love. I think Lilian has to give me a chance, to see that I'm a different kind of guy, and to see that I'm changing things that were wrong. I'm having this feeling that maybe... There! Kiss, kiss! - Whoo! - ♪ I love you no matter what... ♪ - Here's that kiss you were waiting for. - So nice. ♪ We've been through it all Still standing strong ♪ ♪ Not giving up ♪ ♪ I love you no matter what... ♪ Ah! This is like Cinderella. Except instead of slipping on a glass slipper, he's slipping her some tongue. It was a nice kiss, one of those that you feel with your whole body. And you grab him and... I feel so happy. Ah! I think there's some love growing here, something good, and I like it. Lana, thank you for understanding me. ♪ We've been through it all Still standing strong ♪ - ♪ Not giving up... ♪ - I'm not crying. I just go some of their kiss in my eye. You both got green? - Yes. - And? I was just dying for a kiss. Lilian looks beautiful. She's glowing. She's lovely, full of light. Lilian and Joel's kiss was so hot, but the gossip between Caro and Dahiana is even spicier. I wanna talk to you, get to know you better. - Okay. - And... yeah, talk about Israel too. When this all started, and I came to the house, I felt something with Israel. She was the person closest to him then, and I told her. I don't want to have any resentment towards you. If I did, I would tell you. It would show 'cause I'm very expressive, very rude when I want to be. My impression of her wasn't necessarily bad, but a bit easy. If you had done this without talking to me like a woman, I would have been angry, obviously. I wouldn't have looked at you or talked to you. I don't want to have a rivalry with her. I don't want a man to come between us. I want us to be open and generate a bond that has nothing to do with Israel. Not seeing each other as competition, but as friends. May the best woman win. Who's the best? Right here. Carito only heard the word "competition," and tuned out everything else. ♪ Swinging round and round ♪ ♪ On this carousel... ♪ Flor and Nico are building their relationship on a foundation of secret kisses. This date is their chance to connect in another way. No, Lana, they aren't ready! Or... are they? Looks to me like they want to keep losing money. Let's see how they behave. What? With you, I honestly really want... everything. I met someone who... I think is amazing. I want to be with you every day. I thought it was something that... that I had lost. I feel like we have our differences, but we can do so much together. Yeah, have a house together so you can hide and kiss each other in every room. The connection I have with him is... better every day. I like you. You're great. I love you. Flor, hit the brakes, girl. This isn't Formula One. More like the perfect formula to lose a guy. If I find it, fine. - I'd run away. - Win the lottery. - Yeah. - You'd run? I know it's weird, and I know it's hard to understand, but I love you. That's fine. Flor, you may love him, but his look says that he'd love it if you hadn't said that. I don't want this to get out of control because I don't want to get hurt. She said, "I love you," and I won't lie, I was afraid. I´m also afraid of being hurt or letting people down. I like waking up with you. Do you think that'll be the case when this is over? I think so. Nico is more nervous than when someone says "I love you" and you don't know how to respond. 'Cause that's what happened! I see myself calm, peaceful, out in nature. - I see kids. - Kids?! What's happening? - Can you see yourself working on a farm? - Oh. - Cheers. - Cheers. - To us. - For you, I would work on a farm. I'm very happy. I feel like our connection gets deeper every day. I don't know what scared him more, working on a farm or hearing "I love you." At least he didn't run away like he said he would. ♪ So now you gotta go, I know... ♪ What's up? Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Lana's back. Since I've been here, she's never showed up to give us good news. What happened? - What? - Hello, earthlings. Hello! Alien! In order for the couples to get to know each other better, I have prepared the hardest test of abstinence yet, the private suite. No way! Someone tell me what the suite is like, please. Is there a hot tub? What's the bed like? I imagine it super pretty, rose petals, wine. Your ability to resist will be put to the test and two of you will break it in tonight. I'll go to the suite with anyone. Except Nick. He'd hurt me. Oh, no! I want it. I need it. The chosen ones for this test are... Private suite, hotel, beer, a nice dinner, no one watching... Here I come! Lana, the suite. When? - Joel and Lilian. - Yeah? You are the chosen ones to inaugurate the private suite. Bro! - Well deserved! Good job! Great! - Well deserved. Use your alone time wisely to get to know each other without distractions. But remember, the rules of the retreat are still active and your watches won't turn on for the rest of the evening. Oops! Are you sure, Lana? No green light? Sounds like money's getting lost. - But you'll have to sleep together. - I want to see! Enjoy! If I ever get the suite, I think I'd spend the rest of the money with Flor. - Carry her out or something! - Please, don't have sex! Right! This is a catastrophe. I hope no one "comes" in that suite. - My treat! - Do it for me! - Bye! - Bye! Now, it's time for the grand reveal. Hopefully, we don't get a reveal of anything else. It could get expensive. - Whoa! - Wow! That's 20,000 dollars. I could buy a whole neighborhood in my country. With 20,000 dollars, in my country, I could be president. And then, I could give each of you your own neighborhood. - Understood? - Oh, okay. Fine. Please, let's control ourselves. - Let them do whatever they want. - No, no. - Let them enjoy. - Don't... How many times are you going to be here? Look at all this. You could have 30 of those with 20,000 dollars. You came here without a penny. Oh, come on! I think we're about to lose the rest of the money. I trust them. Locho looks like he's trying to figure out the exchange rate of dollars-to-apples. How are you? - Good, because I'm alone with you. - I know. I think I'm more nervous than horny, being in the suite. But we'll see what happens. To us and this beautiful experience we're having. To what we still have to learn and share. Cheers. Thanks. Lilian takes me from zero to sixty. It's not about how she gets your motor running, but how much you can resist. Mm. Good morning. - It's nice waking up here. - It's nice waking up with you, baby. - Sleep well? - Mm-hmm. - A little, but good? - Yeah, a little, but good. Little, but good? Reminds me of my ex. Lilian, honey, let's go see your mom. I wanna ask for your hand. Let's hope her hand is the only part of her anatomy he asked for. Ka mate! Ka mate! Ka mate! Ka mate! How was it? Tell us everything! Did you...? Eh-eh-eh-eh! Lilian arrives and, Mamma mia, it's like she won a fight. They're picking her up, up! - I'm happy. - That's it, my man. I'm happy for you. Who thought you'd be inaugurating the suite, bro! I enjoyed the moment, the night. See, that's the idea. I really enjoyed just being alone with her. - That's great, man! - I just really... I enjoyed the room. Bro, you aren't saying anything. Lilian's over there spilling the beans. I think I'm going over there. Come on, tell us. What happened? They're mature. I've seen them respecting the rules, not spending money. First, it started really calm, like this. - You know, super corny. - Soft? I was like, "Should we tell some jokes?" Those eyes and that hair say they had sex. Plus, with the rose, and you know how he is. - Lilian. Lilian. - And I was like, "So, now what?" Lili, spit it out. When you don't say anything, it's because something happened. I had a great time. That's all I'll say. - Don't be like that, man. - "Don't be like that, man." Can't you see that at times like these, silence is bad. Here's the big question. How much? There goes "Locho the Penny Pincher." - Me? - I knew you were gonna ask that. - How much? - Do you think I spent money? I hope not. I said, "If anyone won't spend money, it's Joel." I would've spent all the rest of the pesos having sex. Pesos? It's dollars, Isra! Bunch of gossips! It's none of their business. Wait until Lana tells you. I'm not saying anything. Not saying anything is becoming a house trend. For example, no one told Dahiana anything about Israel going back for sloppy seconds. That was like getting splashed with cold water. Israel and Carolina act the same. I think they're happy. So, I guess everyone should look for happiness wherever they can. Caught them in the act! Or, caught them in the shower. Well, both. Lana hasn't called them in since the night in the suite. Did they resist? Tell us already, Lana! They aren't talking. If I trust anyone, it's them. Obviously, they had some respect for others and didn't spend anything. The shower wasn't enough for Isra. Now he's being disrespectful in front of Dahiana. Does he miss the handcuffs? If anything happened, I just hope it was worth it. I hope they didn't spend too much, because I want some money too. - Hey! - Hi, Lana! I don't know how to feel when she does that. I'm scared. Joel and Lilian demonstrated that they can have a deep connection in the suite last night. Duh. Bravo! RULE BROKEN No! Sorry, sorry, sorry! However, they broke the rules and prize money has been deducted. I think, in that room, things got out of control. Damn it, man. Maybe just a kiss. A little 500-dollar kiss is fine. If they had sex, we got problems. How much? Let's see how much. I hope they don't get angry. For kisses... ...fondling... ...the oral sex Joel gave Lilian... Oh yeah! ...the oral sex Lilian gave Joel. No way! We're screwed! I can't believe it! All that? - Did you enjoy it? - Yes. Hell yeah! That's what matters! - Hey, Locho... - No, it's not funny. And coitus. Ah, so everything! Oh, little bunnies. I hope there's still money in the pot. Now we know they turned the suite into Sodom and Gomorrah. Is everyone pro-love, or what? She was supposed to be the saint, but she's no saint at all. Forgive me, Locho! Please! Yeah, it's the family lawyer! What? I don't understand. Why are you cheering? We're gonna be poor. Guys, you owe me a lot of money. I felt bad, but after this, I think a lot of people are actually spending more money than me. - Jesus Christ! - Everyone's nervous. From the pot, we have deducted 18,000 dollars. - I knew it! - Help Locho. Help him, please! Please, get some tea to bring Locho back. Paramedic! Locho! A yacht, an apartment, maybe a small island, who knows? You can buy anything in my country, so many things. And for that celebratory kiss, the cost is eight hundred dollars. - Why? - No! - No, no, no! That wasn't a kiss. - No, it was a peck. Can we play back the video? This leaves you with 56,000 dollars. No one can take away the good times. Oof! They're losing a lot of money, and no one cares. Sometimes, making the necessary connections carries a high price. See you soon. Thank you, Lana! That's it, Lanita. Thanks for the good news. I'm tired. Let's start all over again. Whoever's next, I'll cut off their dick. - Oh please! No one's scared. - You can eat it after. Dahiana went to meditate after seeing Israel and Carolina scrubbing each other's backs. We came, or I came here, with the idea of raging, or partying, like you guys say. - Right. - But then, all these rules, and trying to form true connections, it made me think that... Well, about going farther, if I want to have a relationship, all these workshops are important. So, I realized that you're not the kind of person I like for a relationship. Because I like men with character and who are secure about their partner and themselves. And it's not like you're wearing handcuffs. The shower was good, huh? He was kind of nervous. I don't think he really knew what to say. I felt more of a friendly connection with you because I thought there wouldn't be anything else with Caro, no more connections. This reaffirms for me that he isn't the kind of guy I like. I think we could be really good friends, and have a great time, and it helped me realize this, the kinds of connections I can have in the house. And with Carito, she's... she's the one I like. Good. I'm happy. And I hope that you create beautiful connections, because I really think you should enjoy and make the most of this place. And you should experience real, sincere love. - I really want that for you. - Of course. Thank you. And be good! You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here. Although this is your home for now. Whatever. I just always wanted to say that. After losing almost half the prize money, they did what anyone would do. Play volleyball. Now that Lilian's connection with Joel is clearer, she wants to also clear things up with Zaira, from when she was hunting on her land. Well, you saw, I don't know, in the beginning it was like, "You and Joel are great together." - Yes. - But honestly... I wasn't going to be with him if I didn't feel... - Normal. - Yeah. So, I had to get to know him to see if I really liked him or not. - I know he's handsome. - No one can choose for you. Exactly. But I also liked Nick, and I didn't want to close myself off to the possibility of being with other people. I thought I was in the wrong, not because of the date, he can try to have other connections, but the kiss. But I don't have any problem with you. I understand. I think she took it really well. She said she doesn't have a problem with me because she sees the problem as being with Nick and his betrayal. And that's what you have to do. You can't be hard, like me. - It hurts. - I like your personality. Sometimes, when you give so much and people don't give back, you end up getting hurt. Yes. You need to keep your boundaries up, knowing that. I didn't know Lilian had a PhD in love advice. I'm going to take her advice, and I'm going to start today. Keep winning, like always. Go, girl! Girl talk never fails. What's this? Who are they? If you have money on the table, don't spend it. We're not just thinking, "Money, money, money." Love isn't worth that much. In Argentina, I make 200 dollars a month working every day of the week. Enough already, Locho! Lana! Intruders! Call the police! No. These two agents work for me. Like an email with a virus? Something like that. I brought these two grenades to test the relationships at the retreat. Lana, your system could be hacked. No, the ones getting hacked are the little bunnies. I feel more of a friendly connection with you. I'll resist. Will you resist? Stop talking about things you don't know. - Hey, stop. - But what's that? Huge surprise! I mean... - This can't be happening! - New guys. Is it new guys? New guys! New guys! I thought there wouldn't be anything else with Caro. Whoo! Competition and love means explosion. I'm not afraid of challenges or these new guys. Bring it. - No more connections. - Who is it? No! Two? Can our hot singles resist more temptation? Can they resist the grenades? She likes Arjona, for sure. Grenades activated. - A real man who tears my clothes off. - Oh shit! I'm here to be bad, misbehave. A prize that keeps shrinking. You sons of bitches! - A kiss? - No, no. This isn't happening. Blinking watches... COMING UP NEXT... Crumbling connections... My dick is on the ground. I don't know if you want something serious. If you touch the fire, you will get burned. ♪ Feeling electric ♪ ♪ Different dimensions ♪ ♪ We are connected ♪ ♪ We are electric... ♪ ♪ We are electric ♪
