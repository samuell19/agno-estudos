North Sea Is Dead Sea filmed in Hamburg and on the lower Elbe North Sea Is Dead Sea At 13 he ran away from home North Sea Is Dead Sea for the first time. He wanted to go to London and later to Paris. They were weird feelings as he stood on the street at night. The sleeping bag under his arm and 30 marks in his hands. He smoked many cigarettes and then day is dawning And at 7 they got him unfortunately his dad was quicker. When he was around 15 he tried it again and it worked this time. They swore much then. Three days later, when he had the feeling that he was away far enough he called home and said he's fine. Actually, nothing was fine and there was already no more money. And now he stood there in some cold train shed. Uwe! - Yeah, yeah. Uwe, come on. What's going on? Get me cigarettes! I think I should do homework? You can forget that, you won't get an apprenticeship anyway. No way, just because you've forgotten your fags, right? Don't you embarrass me! - Yes, yes, all right. Gimme money! Gimme money! Mark pieces. Tell Mom that she should come home! But she can't before eighteen thirty. I'm hungry! Only eating, the man! Well, Uwe, getting drinks for your old man? Don't look like that! You can't blame him for his dad drinking. Uwe, where do you want to go? Tax dodging. Don't you have two separate Mark pieces? Of course, I've got two individual Mark pieces. Two brand new ones even. But when I get free cigarettes, we have to smoke and have the money. You kidding? You can't do that: that's machine cracking. So? Who says that? - My dad. What are you fumbling around for? - The station woman. Look who's lurking there! Sometimes I think he's unable to see anything with his slitty eyes. Nonsense! He can see alright! He just knows not to look, because we're here. Man, what a moon face. What'll it be, please? - The steak. No, the other please! OK now? I think the wog has a German bike. Show me! Eh, eh, dangerous! Come down, man! Don't you know that wogs aren't allowed to ... ride German bikes? - Yes, do you know? Wicked, kids! - Here you go again. I can use a bike, too. Please make it quick. Let the boy alone! Let the boy alone! They stole my valve! - Give the valve back! - What kind of a valve? - Is it food? - Give the valve back! Is it food? Oh there. What's that? - Hare in the pit ... - She plays the tortoise. You see, can't see anything with her slit eyes. Oh, the great helper comes. As I said, with their slit eyes they can see quite well. At least he's good at pumping. Thank you! Were you in training? Yes. Uwe! I won't say that again! Yes, I'm coming already! What a shit. The bar is jam-packed. Then tomorrow after school. - I have to use the toilets now. - Cut the crap! He'll be really mad, because I haven't taken the fags to him. I'd like you to do it. You think I'd go up there to the guy? I'll get slapped by him in a jiffy. Are you crazy? The old man's sleeping. Where is Uwe? I have asked where Uwe is! One moment! I can't understand! Have you got a crack in the brain? Leave the boy alone. He should help me. Go away! Don't bite me again! You'll get one in the neck. I swear. Leave my mother alone! - Get up, Dschingele! - Yes. - Bye! - Bye, Mommy! Man, Walter! Don't you remember me? Yes. Hans-Peter. You've changed a lot. Yes, I suppose so. I've just taken over this ship. - You're not married, are you? - Yes, for six years. My wife would mind if I was constantly on the move. Hello, Helga! Give me a double. To the son of a bitch! What's the matter, Walter? Nothing! Go away wog! Good riddance! Leave him alone, the mama's boy. Will you come, Uwe? Nah, we both have something else to do. - What? - Arrange something. - This is closed! - Who says that? I! And Uwe too! And whoever wants to make fun of me ... gets it so that he'll still dream of it tomorrow. I only want a bratwurst. And chips. I've not eaten a lunch today. Give me some money! But stay out. - Hey, what's going on? - A sausage and chips. - And chips. - With mayonnaise. - Evi's buying something. - And the sausage? - That's the tip. - You're kidding? - Commission. Now piss off, man, or I'll smash your face in. - You'll get this back. - Stay on your feet! - Are you going on the game? - No, I'm sunbathing. - You won't tan that way. - That's fate. Man, you should keep watch and not look on. Done! The wire! Watch out! That's dangerous! You may get a shock. What did I bring tape for? I've got it! - Insert 20 Pfennig. - I have no money. - Man, how did I do? - Terrific! Yes, with a wire. Look for the kitchen guy. - He's sleeping! - Give me your knife! - You have one yourself. - I snapped it yesterday. And pump up the volume, so that the kitchen bloke's ears ring. Aren't you quite right in your head, or what? You're gambling like world champions! I'll come, too in a moment. Leave the money alone! You'd better distract the kitchen guy. - Why me? - Because you made such a noise before. - Hello! - What's up, Gerd. - Buy something. - What? What do you have, for nothing? It makes me dizzy just looking at it. - It doesn't clatter anymore! - I've got the rat-tat-tat blocked. Hello! Hey, wait! Do you know this one, if one swallows a phone ... No connection under this number! The kitchen dude! Well! Not looking good any longer, huh? Just go and say that we're coming. - Up here on the shoulder? - Of course! - I should say, Uwe is coming. - So what? We want to count the money! Yes, first let go of my bike! Finally, I had expenses for the drill and all that. You got the drill from your old man. And for seconds, I've brought it all up. So what? And you want money for that too? - Commission or something. - The boss always gets more. - That again. He wants to be the boss. - Shut up, the cops. Are you crazy? You can't leave me like that. - Well, what do you want? - A knife. Don't you have real ones? I may not sell to you. - Have you any money? - Sure! - What does it cost? - 24 marks and 70 Say, where did you get so many ... - What is this? - An Erma ERP 74 4 mm. Do you need a weapons permit? No. - Then I can get one. - Costs 235 marks. - But I don't sell to children. - Am I still a child then? Where did you get all the coins from? Saved 'em. - Well, Uwe. - What? Yes ... Want to drive? You serious? Of course! Come on, get in! Terrific! But what's going on here again? - What happened? - I don't know yet, right now! No, little shit, nothing. It was only the sheet metal. The damn plate! - Throttle is open? - Clutch, gas. Well, Uwe, very late today, huh? The money from the slot machine, our share. My father found the money and pocketed it. Who says that's true? You can ask him. You're nuts. Do we go, "Mr. Schiedrowsky, where is the money?" Cook up something new. Man, I've got an idea. Are you crazy? Jerk, where do you want to go with the box? Yes, he comes closer. Hey, you damn wog, I'll show you what's coming. Tight lines! Say hello to the fish from me. Now he's munching grass all alone. Come on, we're not staying forever, old lazy bones. Coming already. - What about our money? - Exactly! What money? The share from the slot machine. - Not that again. - Oh this problem. We clear that later. First we beat it. The damn wog wants his face smashed in. Come on! Man, you've killed him. Uwe, you old coward, now you count huh? - Now Uwe wants to do karate. - The wog is also in karate training. Ah, both don't know any real karate. Now you're fixing my raft. Go! Get started! Get started already! How, if I don't know what to do? It's fixed. Uwe, come here. What is it? Here, pull! Come on! Well, pull it, you wimp! Now he's getting bossed around by a wog. Now he's done with. Now the raft is complete. - And now? - Launch. - Do you honestly want to try again? - Come here. This went down like a lead balloon, huh? And the wog can strike quite a blow. And he can also build rafts. Raft building. Kids' stuff. I can even drive a car. Break into one even. Chasing rainbows? - Really, drive a car? - Yes, no kidding. - You sure? Any car? - Man, if I say that! - Any foreign car? - Yes, easily! Hopefully he's better at driving than before with the wog. This has nothing to do with being better, man. With a fit of temper, as the wog had just now, not even the cops can do a thing. I'd have to kill him. Killing? You? The wog is much stronger than you. Yikes, the strong Uwe. But you had a knife. - You could have stabbed him. - Do you think I'm up for the clink? By the law it's self-defence. - Says who? - My dad. Where did you get the knife? - Why? - Yes, why? Tribunal, Uwe Schiedrowsky. Any thoughts about this, Goldie? Just show me that knife. Here it is. He'll get spanked a second time. Hey, I've found a car. Man, I've found a car. Come along. Hey, help, my car! Man, so you are a real racer now. Man, the cops! Ms. Schiedrowsky? I'm sorry to bother you, but the boy says, your man isn't home yet. I've to talk to you. But I can't easily get out of here. Right now. Could your man be at home by now? May be possible. But it's not sure. Then it is probably the best if we look ourselves, then you're not held up. Maybe he's still not there. - I told you, he's not there. - Wait and see. - Hello, Mr Schiedrowsky. - Hello. What's happening here. The boy drove a stolen car on a public road. - Several public roads. - Who, Uwe? That's him. A little more careful with the boy, Mr. Schiedrowsky? - What now? - We must report the case. - Can't I do anything? - No, you can't do anything. - And where's the boys now? - The boy? He's here. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. You've gone crazy, right? To bring the cops onto me. Is this the thanks for driving the car? Dschingis! Is this blood in your shirt? - I've cut myself, Mommy. - So much? Mommy, what is the odd injury. - What's your name? - Dschingis. - Can you do me a favour? - Yes. Can you tell the school that I'm sick? - What do you have? - Here. - What is it? - Oh, nothing. - Well, show me! - That changes nothing. - Well, show it. - Did I do that? - Nope, that was my dad. Hey! Can you bring the school work, in case my dad wants to see it later. - I can do that. - Okay. Bye! - Na! - Na. - Do we have a lot of school work? - No, it's OK. - Won't you come in? - Yes. Do you have these too? No, my mom doesn't want me to have those. You can have it. Come on. I give it to you. - Does it still hurt? - Ah, it's OK. Does your father beat you a lot? Yes, I don't even count the slaps any longer. But yesterday I really believed that he'd kill me. There will come a day when he's drunk and he turns on me, and I'll smash his face in. And now? You can do nothing about it? I've already imagined all day to leg it. But on the highway, they think that I'm all of 13. And if you want to hide somewhere, you have to steal something or break in, or whatever, and then they nab me and later, I'm put into a Home for Crime. Also I don't know where I'll go. Maybe ... If you like, you can come to me ... - If you like. - Seriously? - Even if your mom knows all? - She allows me everything. In addition, she always says, that I should bring a friend. - I don't believe it. - We can ask her. - She works in the factory. - Come on. Come on! - Two! - "Thank you," you mean. - Thank you! - Adults or children? - Adults, of course! - 90 each I pay for both of us. Ms. Ulanow, into the conference room please. Dschingis! What will people think of the foreigners. May Uwe Schiedrowsky live a few days with us? I've said that's OK and that you allow it. I've nothing against it. And that's why you made me stop work? Yes, Mommy. Bye Mom and many, many thanks! - I'll tell him now. - Dschingis, come back! - What? - Has he got permission from parents? Now, that's just it. His father nearly killed him yesterday. You can't. Why not? This is contrary to law. I've promised him. You've always said, I should bring a friend. I promised him and he's waiting downstairs. It's contrary to law, to hide other people's children. It will be punished. Mom, you just don't want to. It can't be against the law if it helps Uwe. His dad'll beat him to death. Dschingis understand me! I can't! You just don't want to! Never thought she'd be like this. Really never thought she'd be like this. I've never asked for anything. - It's not that bad. - Yes! You can't know that. I'll get back at her. I'll come back at her. Now we bugger off together. Are you crazy? You can stay, if you've got scared stiff. I'm saying nothing, Dschingis, the raft is very good. But it is a little exhausting. We row like crazy against the current and achieve nothing. - We can sail later. - Goh! My hands hurt. I'm saying nothing, Dschingis, but where do we want to go? Up the Elbe. We get ourselves into the reeds. No one will find us. - Up the Elbe is there though. - There is current. We can't go against it. We have to go down, through the channels. What about the mast. We can't go under the bridges with it. - We'll see. - Yes, we'll see. The raft is indeed quite noticeable. It's not the best for running off in. We'll be through shortly. Look, Dschingis, my name. Man, look at that! Man, there is my dad's launch. I won't row further. If he nabs me ... I'm saying nothing, Dschingis, the raft sails great. But unfortunately in the wrong direction. Say, you can also deal with real boats, like sailing boats? Yes, why? Where does that go? The rudder. Mount on the rear in the back. - And this? - The boom. Tighten to the mast. Lower! Am I on my own here? Or can't you deal with such a boat? Where does this belong? Shackle to the right halyard and pull it up the mast. Tell me, what's the matter, anyway? That's not our boat. But mate, I know that. That's not our property. What's property, if the boat is just tied up here. Property is also about the boat being used. And at this moment the boat is not needed. Otherwise it wouldn't be tied up here. So at this moment there's no owner on board, right? I don't know. But in any case you'll be punished. Punished? For what? You'd have to do real damage then. For example, cut a hole in the bottom; or the boat must disappear completely. But if we bring back the boat by the weekend, then no damage is done. The bloke doesn't need the ... here ... boat anyway. He has to work. And if he doesn't have to work? Then he can give us the boat even more. - Hey, stay here! - What should I do? Slacken the jib. - And the raft? - It'll drift into the bushes. We need a foresail. If this happens often, then we can't survive here. - Fetch the life jackets. - Here. Look at that, Dschingis! Dad used to go to school there. It's the navigation school. Not to much avail. Ready about? Come on. Go! Come on. Go! Go over to the other side. Can't you ... Do you have to sail so fast? If you want to wipe the floor with me, just say it. I can't tell the wind how to blow. - I'm saying nothing, ... - Then say nothing. But we wanted to sail up the Elbe, not down. Down the Elbe are more sailing boats. We'll attract less attention. But isn't there the North Sea. To the North Sea, it's at least 100 Km. Then I'll say nothing. My mother is probably already with the police. My dad is sorry, that he can't hit someone. Does your mother never spank you? Nope. My mother says at most, "Dschingis, you comb your hair." "Your shirt is dirty." "What will people think of the foreigners." When I wanted to learn to swim my mother didn't allowed it. - Why? - Because she was afraid I'd drown. Funny, I don't think of my mother. She is always okay. Show me! Man, you don't see it anymore. - Really? - Yes. The two boys are probably on the run with a stolen sailing boat on the lower Elbe. Notify river police! We can't do more at the moment. - I'm so sorry. - Well. You asleep? Yeah! What's that? I think it's a dog. - Will we sail back home tomorrow? - I've thought of that. - Ah, Mr. Schiedrowsky. - What now? - You don't miss your boy? - No, why? He's probably gone off with Mrs. Ulanow's boy. This time he stole a sailing boat. I'll never believe it. He can't stand the wog. We know nothing about that. Mrs. Ulanow has told us, that yesterday you beat your boy up. What! It's all a lie! The Chinese witch can't accuse me like that. I'll report that scumbag. I've got nothing to do with it. Are you sleep? Man, I don't know, myself. Wanna go and see what's going on back there? We can go, yes. Well, wait! Wait, you know, you! What's that? It looks like a clink. Let's go, guys! This is a clink! Stop here. Two, four, five, six ... What are you doing up there? Guys give up. There's no point. Well, give it up, boys. You won't get far. Set the jib. - It's good, no? - Set the Cross. What's the matter? We did steal the boat. That you knew perfectly well. You talked me into it. Don't get weird ideas. You used to be hot on a sailing boat. Set the Cross now. I believe the guys were just as old as we are. - Shut up. - What's the matter? Yes, they were as old as we are. They've also done the same as us. - So what? - So what. If we come home now, we walk into the clink. Are you crazy now? Now, you're totally crazy, you know? If someone's going into the clink, I'm the one. Don't you know, "Cling together, swing together!" Water, water, water, but nothing to drink. I don't know if I'm more hungry or more thirsty. The 100 Km to the North Sea have probably gone past, haven't they? Or do you really want to go into the North Sea? Where else can we go? Say, are you completely nuts? North Sea Is Dead Sea. You've never heard the saying? I've just been thinking. Somehow it's so stupid. You want to sail but also get back home. I don't want to sail at all and I don't want to be back with my dad. The cops! You'll sail into the reeds for real? Take up the centreboard! - Then we flip. - Go on, take up the centreboard! Attention! Attention! River police speaking. - Man, they're after us! - Nonsense, it's much too shallow here. They'll never come near us. Anton 3, Anton 3 by Pamir 2. We just lost two teenagers in a stolen sailing boat, going foreshore. Moving flush to the Poplars, inland along the subsidiary Elbe. Come! Yes, understood. We'll take the dyke. Uwe! Come on! But c'mon! Man, you can't fill yourself with these. Man, a kiosk! There's something real to eat. The cops again! Where do we go from here? I know. If you eat more green apples, you get the runs. Oh crap, I mean ... At some point they nab us. It's logical that they nab us. Think about it. The longer we stay away, the more soft they get. Or do you think my dad would stop drinking, when you tell him "Mr. Schiedrowsky, you should not drink that much." Nope. Only a real shock will do. E.g. when I'm dead, then he would change, maybe. I don't know whether my mother should change. I've got a very different opinion. Dschingis, your shirt is dirty. Dschingis, your hair must be combed. Dschingis, bla bla bla ... But not by a shock. Looks like an orange. Don't speak about food. I'll crack it now. I suppose you lost your mind, huh? Stealing a car and stealing a boat is still alright. But now burglary as well? How long should I be in the clink? I'm hungry. We can steal the milk from the farmers. He's crazy. Are you crazy, Dschingis! Behind the dyke are houses. Anyway, I'm hungry. No more fasting. Go on! You can't see anything. Give it to me, the bag! That's a ... You can't do that, that's ... That would be ... Think about it logically! Wanna break a kiosk every night? We need money. Man, that's a real pistol. Nonsense, this is an Erma ERP 74 4 millimetre, license-free. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang! I can eat for at least 3 days. Ah, I'm stuffed. I'll move on to the cigarettes. We need to get out. Dawn's breaking. I thought I could eat for days, but I'm already stuffed. - That's ice cream for you. - It's not eating, it's licking. I'm sure my mother hasn't slept all night. Oh, you bug me with your mother. If you have such a longing, then go to the police and say you've got lost. Well, I'm sure they'll buy that. Also, I don't know whether my mother still wants to be with me. Now, that I'm a criminal. Yes, one gun was still in the kiosk. - We'll send Anton 2 for backup. Be careful. The culprits may be armed. Yes, I got that. - Over. - Roger that. We can say, that I stole the sailing boat, then you can go home. Rubbish, they know that I was there. But I can say that I talked you into it. They'll definitely buy that. I've already stolen the car. You've nothing to do with that. Clinging to your cigarette like a baby to a pacifier. Say that again. You cling to your cigarette like a baby to a pacifier. I'll look at that. Yes, I'll take the other side. - Stop! Freeze! - Go, run! Stop right there! Or I'll shoot! Stop! For the last time! I'll shoot! The cop's shooting for real. Don't bugger around! Stop now! I'll shoot! - What's going on? - They've escaped. Man, we surely can't repeat that. Next time, they'll nab us. Maybe next time, but it's better to be screwed next time than right now. Think about it. The longer it takes, the more our folks and the court will soften. I often dream about nicking a sailing boat and just running off. I don't know where to. The main thing is that I'm no longer at home. It doesn't work with the folks anymore. Now we want to see how far the journey will be and whereto the wind'll blow me. There has to be a spot for a really cool life. And I want to go there. I often dream about nicking a sailing boat and just running off.
