Try to lift this side. Go on. Use the rope. Shit. Lower this side. Turn it around. Right around. Get it out again. Careful... Put it on the side. What's going on? We have a problem. The casket is too big for the vault. So, we have to take it out and try to widen the opening of the vault with a chisel to try to get it in. Well, if that helps... Benoît... our friend... you were great, not just in size. And you were strong, not just physically. You meant a lot to us. More than a colleague, a friend. You were... I'll say it: You were a giant. And often a guide inside and outside work. We'll miss that. I solemnly swear that your wife and son can count on us. Your family is our family. Franck, why don't you finish this at home? A CHANGE OF HEART Give us a hand. Florian! What's going on? Stop it. - Come in! - 'Evening, Gisèle. Good evening. - Wow! - Get used to it! - Let's go. - OK. - Bitch! - Give me your hand. What for? - To wash you. - OK. Just my hands. I can do my ass. Can't you do it any better? - You gonna be long? - I'm done. You can't work days for at least a month. Why? We have to wait till Sylvie leaves. Chantal, ER just called. They want to send us 3 patients. - What are they? - Sudanese. - No. - I said we had free beds. We don't want 'em. This is a geriatric ward. Don't they get that? You scared me! Jungle, please. What? I want to go to Jungle. - Can you take me? - No. No, I'm going home. For fuck's sake! Are you OK? You should be more careful. I looked. Be careful. That's dangerous. Come! It's cold. Come on. Come on! Shit, I hope we're not lost. Recognize it? What's wrong with them? They are going to England. They scared me. Here. Thank you. You're welcome. Oh, for fuck's sake! Hey, you! Stop! Give me that! Give me that! What the hell? Is that how you thank me? Why d'you do that? Scum of the earth! What are you doing? Do that later. Goodnight. Hello. I have some clothes to drop off. Go over there. Hello. Hello, ma'am. How are you? - Need a hand? - They're my husband's clothes. - Zymako. - Béatrice. - Are you with the charity? - No. Hello. I have more in the car. Can you find that laundry bowl? - Is your car over there? - Yes. Why not give us a hand? No, I'm just getting rid of stuff. I work with old folk. So, blacks and Arabs, no, thanks! Are you a nurse? No, I'm a nurse's aide in a geriatric ward. - That's great. - Thanks. Well, we'll manage. The two of us can do this. Where's your husband? He died. Goodbye and thanks. Did you hear what she said? What a racist! Really? - English? Do you speak English? - No. - Hi there! - I haven't heard from you in ages. There's a photo at the station. Really? Which one? A good one. In uniform. Yeah, they wouldn't use a photo of him dying of cirrhosis in the hospital. - Are you OK? - Yeah. - Life? - Yeah. Plenty of work. Every day, more show up. They even beat each other up. One got lost the other day at the hospital. - He asked for a lift. - Really? I said OK. Why did you do that? I don't know. What got into you? You really did that? How reckless! He could've attacked you. - He was a kid. - Still... They have nothing to lose. They can be dangerous. I dropped him off. He thanked me. That's all. We keep getting complaints about theft and rape. It's not called the jungle for nothing. They're worse than our Arabs. Real savages! Béatrice, be careful. I'd hate anything to happen to you. 30 minutes, at the most. OK. Hi. Excuse me. Bye. I brought you clothes, remember me? Yes, strangely enough. What does "strangely enough" mean? Look, I have to pick up unsold goods. They give you unsold stuff? Does helping blacks and Arabs shock you? I don't care. They're with me. Come on, guys! Let's go! Where to? A free canteen. Françoise... - I've brought this. - Thanks. Antoine, we have to settle this. Hello. He gets overwhelmed by silly stuff. Why did he put it here? Hello. - Ingrid. - Béatrice. You're new here, aren't you? - It's my first time here. - OK. - Do a fucking list. - I don't have time. What's wrong? - Hello, Monique. - I'm not Monique. I'm Béatrice. Oh, shit, yeah... Monique texted me to say she couldn't come. - What do you mean? - She can't come. You know how it is. I don't come often. I have a big delivery arriving in an hour. What'll I do? - Look, I forgot. - But... - Don't go off the deep end! - I'm not. Listen... - I just need to be told. - I know. That's all. What'll I do now? I'll give you a hand. It won't take long. - It will. - I can help. - Really? - Sure. I'm only doing this because I have a big heart. - I take photos here. - I'm not asking you to. It's nobody's job. - I can help out this afternoon. - And tomorrow? I have a job. Not tomorrow. - I work nights. - You're only here today? They've knocked down the southern part, 4,000 people have come here. They're all here together, but they don't get on. So, we volunteers smooth things over. OK? I love volunteering and getting to know the people who work here and winning their trust. Hi. Hello. Hello, gentlemen. We don't want this camp to exist, but it exists because of the politicians. We don't want people to live like this. They cover their faces to protect their families in case people from back home recognize them. Excuse me. We could hear a car coming. Suddenly, there was a bang! You're laughing? It's not funny. It looks like a body being thrown out. The car drives off. I say: "Go see." It's his job. He was scared stiff. Can you believe it? The scaredy-cat! That's why you became a cop! You're brave with your pals and when you're in uniform. And your gun! - Go on. - Be quiet! Do you want to lick it? I bet you do! Oh, how lovely. It's my gift in that case! - I didn't help him choose. - Really? - Thanks. - She chose, he paid. You really spoiled me. Well, it's a celebration. Great! Really pretty. Thanks, it's lovely. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. It's your birthday. - It's over, I'm old now. - It's a new phase of life. I can't wear this pullover. - Why not? - It's gross! And it's too small. Yeah, that's true. So, give it away. I can't. It'd upset Dominique. It's not nice. It's a gift. I can find a home for it. - I gave Benoît's clothes away. - Who to? The refugees. Hang on, you gave Benoît's clothes to immigrants? The migrants in the jungle. What about French people? I gave them to people in need. - What're you playing at? - I'm not. Really? Do you want to disgrace yourself? - Disgrace myself? - Yes. Benoît must be spinning in his grave. - You think? - It's not what he would've wanted. That's my opinion... Well, Benoît is dead. So, he can spin all he likes. Know what those people do? - Yeah, they're migrants. - Yeah. No, but... I'll give it to the cleaner. It'll shine in the dark! - All those stars and things! - Not so loud. Nobody can wear that. - Shine bright! - Quiet. It'd really suit her. A really kitsch singer with hair like this. I know, I know! - She has huge boobs. - My wife! Her name sounds like "amour". Lova Moor! He represents the Catholic Church. The Pope! It's what a monkey eats. Bananas! - Foucault! - We've done him. So what? An insect which doesn't live long. - Mayfly! - Butterfly! - OK... - You're not going so soon? - I am. - Come on! Well, thanks. Bye. - What got into you? - What? Why do you provoke them? You've changed, Béa. Everyone says so. I know it was hard with Benoît. - "Hard"? - Well, we liked him, but... You mean the beatings? Here. I stole your pullover. - Bye! - Wait, let's talk. Excuse me. Hello. What's that? He said that he don't want to drink water. Nothing that goes through his lips. - No drink... - That's dangerous. - His drink. - No, he doesn't want to drink. They said did I make something here? I did something here, so for me, it's final. Where can they go? They can't leave. They have no tents, no blankets... We stay and try to help. Not bad. Who wants it? Mom, didn't we have some straws? - What do you want? - Straws. Here. Thanks. Where were they? In the living room. You coming? Hello there. Hi. Françoise is looking for you. - You know Ingrid, the journalist? - Yeah. She needs a place to finish editing her video. Could you put her up? Well... why not? My mother does all the housework, so I'll have to ask her. - But... - It's so she can work in the day. - That's all. - Yeah, but... I mean, she just can't work here. - Just for a few days... - OK. - I'll ask my mother. - OK, thanks. See you later. Hello. Hi. Where are they? - They've gone. - Where? I don't know. When did they go? - Can I leave this here? - Sure. - What is it? - It's for the Iranians. Ingrid... Where are the Iranians? They've gone. There's a request for extradition. Hang on. When did they go? Wait! - Sorry. - It's OK. Are they in England? No, actually, they're... Maybe they'll go, but not right away. Meaning? Well, they've gone. Did you know? Yeah. Anyway, they've gone. They were scared of being dublined. What's that? You're fingerprinted in one country, you can't get asylum elsewhere. If it's done in France, you stay here. - So, it's good news? - Yes, they're fine. OK. Actually, they had an opportunity. So, we decided to... Well, the less you know, the better. Are you in touch? Françoise said you need a place to work. - Yeah. - I have to ask my mother. OK, thanks. You live with your mother? That's nice. I'm not making fun. It's cool. Well, I live with her, so I'll ask her. It's like in Japan. I'm not making fun. Hello. I'm Joe. I gave Ingrid a hand. - Haven't we already met? - Your face looks familiar. We put her things there. I'll take you back. - Bye. - Bye-bye. Actually, I'd like to sleep here if that's OK with you. I'm sick of spending the night in the jungle. It's hard as a woman. We're in the minority. I'm at my wit's end. Sure. I should have offered. Thanks a lot. I'll just go get my things. - What are they? - My work things. You can't leave your things unattended. So, I leave all my stuff in my car. Mom, she's sleeping here. Hey. You can have my room. I'll sleep in the basement. You can have a good sleep. That's kind. I can't help you with my back. Know what? I'll take a few things upstairs. - 'Night. - I thought you wouldn't... - What? - You wouldn't say goodnight. Don't wake them up. OK, boss! 'Night. Goodnight. Hi. You should see the state of your room. Why? The door was half-open. And that's not all. Hello. - Osman. - I'm Béatrice, his mother. You OK? Sorry, I should've said. He just came to take a shower. His whole family's dead. I thought it'd do him good to watch TV with Florian. He loved it. - OK. - Thanks. I'll get some things from my room. Florian, lay the table. - Osman? - No, thanks, I don't drink. - Ingrid? - No, thanks. Not in front of him. Do you have fish knives? You don't have fish knives? - No. - Oh... It doesn't matter. It's just to show Osman. In France, they have knives for fish. It lets you separate the flesh from the bones. I'd love to see you try. He's used to eating with his fingers. I'd love to see you using a fish knife! - Yeah, OK... - I don't use 'em, either. You can't eat with your fingers. We all have things to learn from each other's cultures. Thanks to the jungle, I can do it all. How modest. - In terms of eating. - Oh... As for the rest... When did you arrive, Osman? - In France? - Yeah. A long time ago. It's been 3 years. Did you come straight here? I left the Sudan and arrived in Libya. I took a boat... Libya to Italy... 4 days. - On your own? - No. I came with 150 people. No, but did you leave your family? Yes, they're in the Sudan. Tell what happened at the station. I arrived at the station. But I didn't go out because I was underground. Tell it properly, how you told me. It was the first time I'd seen trains underground. In his country, he'd never seen trains underground. He didn't know where he was. - You know... - Yes, he can sleep here. You can sleep here, Osman. OK? There's a spare mattress in Florian's room he can use. She's here to work, not treat the place like a hotel. She brought her dirty laundry and just left it in the kitchen. Florian doesn't do that. You're getting walked all over. 'Morning, son. Time to get up. The whore! What a fucking whore! - She's a whore! - What's wrong? She's screwing him! That disgusts me! Filthy bitch! I'm so fucking naive! What a whore! She's out of here tonight! - She's gone. - Gone for good? I didn't understand. - Where to? - I don't know. What about all her mess? Shit! I wanted to yell at her. - Hi. - Hi. What're you doing here? - You look well. - Yeah. What's going on? A migrant fell off a truck. His head was ripped off. Yeah, it's terrible. Things are tough for us. For you? Really? Nothing. I don't want to have that discussion with you. - What? - Nothing. You sound like you're talking about a dog. Well, what can I say? It's true. Calm down. I didn't kill him. - Can I go? - Yes. Bye. Hey, Joe! Are you OK? It's terrible. - Did they tell you? - Yeah. - Do you know him? - We can't see him. Béatrice, move along. Out of the way, sir. - Hello. - I'm Béatrice. - I'm Sonia. - I'm here to see Joe. No, I hate that! No, stop it. I don't like it. Don't spray her. Give me that. - It's silly, but it annoys me. - It's not silly. Béatrice is a friend. Don't shoot at her. - Can you take him? - OK. Thanks. What's going on? - Remember the sewed-up lips? - Yes. There's a problem. We tried to help Mokhtar and Dara. They've just been robbed. - How so? - We had a plan. Well, Ingrid did. They went to Bilbao. Why? For a people smuggler. Ingrid put them in touch, but they got robbed. - What? - Sorry. Yeah, well... We can't blame her. - We can! - She tries, but she's useless. I found them in a parking lot. They'd been locked up. Really? I promised I'd try to help them. - How? - It's now or never. It's time to step things up a gear. Meaning? I really want to help them get to England. That's a good idea. How, though? In a truck, I think. It's nice to have them, but with the kids and the baby on the way, Sonia, and my job... They're here? - Oh, I didn't tell you? - No, I didn't realize... They're here. I'll call them. Mokhtar, Dara... Come here. I'll introduce you to Béatrice. Beatrice. You met before. We met. Sit down. What do you want to drink? - Anything. Milk. - Milk? - And you? - Beer. Cheers. Could you put them up in 2 days' time for a while? That'd give me time to find a truck. If you can't, just say so. - At my place? - Yeah. - Yes. - What? You can't? - Yes, I can. - OK. But you can ask your mother. No, it's OK. I'll call you tomorrow to fix a time, OK? Bye. - So? - No. I said no. - Let me explain. - No need. I said no. It's getting impossible here. There are limits to generosity. Don't bring those refugees home. - It's not like with Ingrid. - I said no. - It was fun at first, but enough. - "Fun"?! Look, the Iranians are staying here, in my home! Joe: I'll bring them tomorrow It's up to me, OK? Sure! Well, I can decide to go. Then what'd you do? You wouldn't last a week without me! You're the one who wouldn't last a week, Mom. I'm putting you up. The only reason I'm here is for Florian. Yeah, I know. Tell them they're welcome Well, give them a hand. Here we are. This is my room. You sleep here. Where will you sleep if this is your room? Where will you sleep? - Down. - In the cellar. You want to sleep in the cellar? - What? - The cellar. It's not a cellar. There are windows onto the backyard. It's fine. - You keep your room. - No, I decide. You sleep here. There, that's settled. There. Garden. - What's this? - A fork. Yes, thank you, Béatrice. I know it's a fork. I wanted to know if it was clean. Mine has gone. Stolen forks... - 3rd one! - 5th! He's counting! - That's crazy. - Pregnant cravings! Well, I have an excuse! Béatrice, you look glowing. - Thanks. - How do you keep such a figure? - I shouldn't ask? - What? I don't know if one can ask women... It's a compliment. I think you look... Well, thanks. Very desirable. Give it a rest. - You're 54, pal. - Well, that's my type. I've always had older men. - How old are you? - 44. How elegant to ask her age! - I don't care. - You don't look it. I lied, too. I'm 45! Never had guys your age? - Or younger? - No, never. See? Is even 46 unthinkable? 46 is a bit young! So, you see, I'm with a chance. No, nobody stands a chance with me. How do you know? I don't want anyone under my feet. I've been there, done that. Well, Béatrice looks stunning. - You're not subtle. - OK, I'll go get a sausage. A nice sausage! What do I do? Yes. What do you want? What? What do you want? I'm going to bed. Good night. Good night. See you tomorrow. We'll go. You wait here. Hey! Are you still having breakfast? Sorry, I didn't think you got up this late. - OK? - Yeah. What's wrong? I'm just here to get my things. Don't move, we'll give them to you. Florian! Why? You fucked me over. I'm not a sucker. Go on, Florian. Help him, Osman. I don't understand. What's wrong? The boy in your bed... Oh, that's it! Oh, I see! Right... So, you judge me because you put me up for a night? - A night? - OK, a few nights. So, you judge me? No, I can't judge you, but I can say I don't trust you. I'm not the only one. I don't believe it! - Hi, Florian. - Hi. Thanks. I'll take that, too. Osman... Beware of her, she's not good for you. Don't say that, you don't know. I just don't believe it. He's an adult. - Bye. - Goodbye. I thought you were gonna throw it at me. So long! Want herb tea before bed? I'm not sure. What about? I'll never change my mind Can I ask you something? Yes. Close your eyes. Please! Again? Is it possible? I'm going to bed. So that's it? Yes. Okay. It's okay. I'd rather. Good night. Yes. Mokhtar! Me... Downstairs? Wait till... till Dara is asleep. And you? Two years ago. And you? When? Really? Does that happen? And you like it? Money? Yes, maybe, a little bit. Just like that? You say that like that? You realize what you're saying? Oh well, now that's it, I have... Finally it happened. - Does it worry you? - Not anymore. - It's over. - You didn't regain your appetite? No. Food is all we have. It's not bad here. - It's not bad? - No, it's not. Aren't some people strict? Bossy. Pretentious. We told the manager, but what can you do? There are idiots everywhere. I'm afraid, I'm afraid... We visited the town, it was a good fun... My God! Oh, no, my fucking mirror! I can't even get in my car. There's shit all over it. Oh, man... Right... Fuckers! OK, let's go. No, no! Oh, shit! - Forgot something? - Shut up! I love your eyes. They're beautiful. It's not that they're beautiful. I can see your kindness. There's an expression that says... eyes are the mirror of the soul. Eyes are the mirror of the soul. That's weird. What? If it's a mirror you don't see my soul. You see your own reflection in the mirror. You see you in my eyes. In fact, that's your kindnes. No. I'm not kind. You're welcome. Hi! It's hot. - OK, Issa? - Yes, you? - Here. - Thank you. Hi. That's not enough. Bye. I'm not Muslim. I converted to Catholism. Not Dara. It's different for me but I respect his choice. It's all part of history of Iran. Basically the state forces people to respect Islam laws... And this is one of the main reason for my departure. What? I didn't get it. The state forced him to be a Muslim. It's one reason he left. I know that. Hi. Am I disturbing you? Not at all. We're having a barbecue. - Want to eat something? - No, thanks. The police station had an anonymous call about you. Normally we don't pay much attention, but as it's you... I gather you've taken in refugees. No. I hope it's not true. Know what you risk? 30,000 euros and 5 years in prison. Really? And there's the risk for you and Florian. What if something happened? People would say: "Well, she asked for it." They'd be right, too. And... People talk. Oh, yeah, I know. Sure you won't have a bite? I'm not hungry. And I have a dentist's appointment. Thanks for letting me know. I'll think twice before taking in refugees. Bye. Who wants a sausage? Yes, please. Who was that? A friend. Why didn't you ask him in? Well, I did. He couldn't stay. What did you say? - What? - What did you say? - What're you playing at? - What's gotten into you? Is this an interrogation? - We knew about your husband. - So? - And? - He's anti-migrant. What're you implying? Say loud and clear what's on your mind. He's part of an anti-migrant group. He was my husband's friend. An old friend. And? Whose side are you on? Are you done yet? Look, I don't like your tone. You're in my home, eating my food. If you don't like it, you can go. The same goes for you. If you don't like who I am or where I'm from, nobody's forcing you to stay! There's the door! Is that clear? Spare me your threats and insinuations. Just keep your mouth shut! - What's wrong? - Nothing. I need you to sign this. It's late. Aren't you in bed? I have work to finish. OK, goodnight. And try knocking next time. - Goodnight. - 'Night. Yes? Florian... I have something to say, but I don't know how to tell you. The thing is... Mokhtar and I... What? Mokhtar and I... Are you shitting me?! - You're shitting me! - No. - Shut up. Get out! - I'm your mom... - Get out. - I'm not asking for your opinion. Get out of my room! You're shitting me! You're like that whore! Seriously? Stop lecturing other people. Who do you think you are with your refugees? Fuck! You're a fucking pain! We've put up with all your shit! So you can get laid like some dumb kid! You're pitiful, pathetic! You're a kid! Get out! Enough! Stop it! - What's going on? - Nothing. We had a fight. Mokhtar and I are together. 'Night. Yeah? Yes. Alright. When? Two days. Slow down a bit. On the left. Look. It's easy to get over that gate. It's a godsend. There's nobody around. - No cameras? - Nope. Usually there are. Not here. See? I would like to tell you how much everything you gave me since the first moment is precious to me. You are precious, Béa, you are beautiful. You are my favorite human being, forever. What's wrong? You speak as if you were saying farewell, as if we'd never see each other again. As if you were leaving me. I just want to make you happy. I can't. Sorry. You can't? You can't... You can't? Mokhtar... it may be the last time. You're going to England. You might forget me. It may be the last time. No, I won't stop because you're leaving, and I don't understand why. I have to go to England. This is my life. This is my way. It's my project. It's my project since really long time. I don't talk about you when I say I go to England. I don't see why you're going. How can you love me and go? How can you love me and ask me this question? I'm not a liar. We can make the most of each other, and that's a good thing. You want to be certain love is pure, but I don't know if love is pure. But the electricity between us also comes from our differences. We often love opposites, don't we? If you have doubts about me, that won't let us move on. But it's not the first time someone has doubted me. In my country, they tried to kill me because I was different. What're you talking about? What're you talking about? I don't understand. You wan't understand me? Yes. Béatrice. I love you. You say my name in full. Yes. Because I love you in full. So, why don't we get married? Answer me. I don't want to get married for papers... to stay. If one day, we get married, it's because we will be free. Hey, Joe... What's that? What? - Are they all going? - They're Sudanese. - But it's too dangerous... - I briefed them. Come! Mustafa, Mohamed, Mokhtar, Dara. Béatrice. Ok. Let's go! You can take your bags. Good luck. Bye! Good luck, bye. Good luck! How are you, Mr. Bouvier? Did you sleep well? - I didn't sleep, did I? - You didn't? I don't know. I don't remember. - I'm losing my memory. - Are you? - That's why I'm here. - I know. It looks like it's going to snow. - Snow? - Yes, snow. - It might snow. - Or sleet. Well, I say! - I'll just rinse... - The radiators aren't very hot. David, can you finish up here? - Sure. - Thanks. Shit! They'll let you go. That's the procedure. Don't worry! I'm Mokhtar Madhavi! Dubline me! Dubline me! I was born in Teheran! Yeah, I know. - Béa, I'm Mokhtar Madhavi. - I know, Mokhtar. Dubline me, I was born in Teheran. - I'm Mokhtar Madhavi! - Stop it. Dubline me, please! I'm Mokhtar Madhavi, dubline me! Stop it! I'm sorry, Florian. Dubline me! Please! I was born in Teheran! Dubline me. I'm Mokhtar. There's still a solution. What's that? A boat. Find somewhere quiet. Go by boat. I'm not for that. Why? Going in a truck is dangerous, but going by boat is very dangerous. It's possible to die! Trucks don't work anymore. A boat is the last solution. Maybe, but... It's okay for me. I have nothing to loose. To live is to do what the possibility of dying. What? Basically, he said he has nothing to lose. That's nice to hear. Wait. I love you. I love all you are. But... I'm not used to commitment anymore. So, the idea of losing you... tears me apart. But... I want you to be free. And... You don't owe me anything. Go... Go on. I don't like this idea. Look, it'll be OK. Don't worry. They have to leave French territorial waters as fast as possible. If they're stopped, they're in England. They get dublined over there. Alright? We'll tell them that. We'll try to find a boat. How much does it cost? I looked on the net. 1,000 to 2,000 euros. - Do you have that much? - No! - And you? - No! I need to ask you something. You said... that if I needed it, that if Florian and I needed it, I could ask you... The thing is... I need money. But it's a lot. - Oh? - 2,000 euros. What for? For the roof. A branch fell on it. What about your insurance? It's complicated. Complicated... If you can't or you won't, I understand. I didn't say that. I'm just surprised. Have you screwed up? You can tell me, whatever it is. If you're in trouble... I'm a cop, but I'm your friend. Do you owe someone money? No. It was stupid to come here. I'm sorry. Béatrice! What you need is a friend. Someone who watches over you. It's true that... things have moved very fast, it's changing... very fast... I can't... I can't handle it all. I can't get my balance. But... I just need 2,000 euros for something I don't want to tell you about. So, there's no point coming here to ask you. Forget it. Charity begins at home. Stay away from the refugees.
