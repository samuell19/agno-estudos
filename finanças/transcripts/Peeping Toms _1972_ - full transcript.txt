I'll come by this afternoon to talk about the business. The same business? - Yes, I've got a new idea. Sure, a new one. I'm well acquainted with the old one. Hello. Hello. Hello. Millie. -I have to prepare food for the kid. Millie, can you say hi? Just hi? -Hi. -Thank you very much. Millie, maybe not today? I'm begging you, I was worn out after the gig, I got beaten up. I'm sorry. I know, I was wrong. I'm begging you, let it go today, huh? Millie, I'm talking to you. - You're in my way. You know, Millie, it'll end bad, I swear. Merav, come here. Merav, leave that and come here. Merav. You don't want to? How's the kid? - OK. What do you mean? You said she had something in her ear. The doctor came? No. Why not? There's no need. Merav... No need? But... Millie, you're getting on my nerves. Quit with this gloomy face and these answers. It drives me crazy, you know? Quiet now. I'm telling you again, quietly, I got beaten up in the gig. I was devastated. I went to Gutte for a drink. So we drank a bit, he dragged me, I was dragged. I finished a whole bottle of cognac. I know it's wrong. I said I'm sorry, I'm saying it again. I was wrong, but tell me, what more do I deserve? You think I don't know what you're going through? How hard it is for you? I know. I'm blind, I'm an idiot, but why can't you think a little how hard it is for me? Merav. -Every evening I go to the stinking discotheques... with that idiot. And for what? Do I enjoy it? Do I go dancing? Do I pick up girls? Tell me. It's for bread. Bread, clothes, water, electricity. It drives me crazy, nuts, and you know it. Millie, it's the lousiest period of my life. You can see that. For 5 months I haven't touched the guitar. I can't. I'm crazy. And then, I come home, and what do I want? What am I asking for? I want you to help me, and you barely say hello. It's like you're doing me a favor. I ask you how's the kid, you say, 'OK', 'Not OK'. 'OK'.'Not OK'. Tell me, who shall I go to? Where? Who can I go to? You're my wife, aren't you? I love you. I love you. I love you, love you. Shall I tear my heart out? Shall I put it in writing? Millie, I'm talking to you. Merav, come here. -Millie, you know, with that face, your answers and Merav, you can suck my cock. Really? We haven't seen it for a long time. Merav, leave it alone. -Come on, if you don't like it, you can go to hell. - You go to hell. Come on, I can slam doors too, you know. Fatso's not around? - No. Come on, come on. Where is he? -Up in the cabin. It's alright, no problem. How much sugar? - 3.3.5 spoons. I don't understand. What was so urgent... that he didn't have time to say good bye? He'll be back, he'll be back, baby, don't worry. -When? Later. Don't worry. Don't worry, you rest, make yourself at home. Come on, I'll wash the salt off you. Stand up. Let me have it for a second. My back. OK? -OK. Cold? -Cold, cold. -There's A large towel inside. Go in. I can't find it. - I'm coming. To find it you have to look for it. Hop. Just a minute. Well? -Well what? How? -How what? In general. - It's great here. Absolute fun. - You see? Hello, hello, wait, wait. What's that? -Hello, Dina. Hello, Gutte, but what's that? - Just a second, Dina. No, no, let me get up. - Just a second, Dina. What's wrong? -I'm asking you, let go, let go. What do you mean? Come here. - Let go. I don't want to. Why? -I don't feel like it. - You will, don't worry. Cut it out, you're annoying me. - Just a second, Dina. What wrong? -Cut it out. I'm fed up with you. Get off me. What I have you got from Elli tonight, and what you have I can get for 20 pounds in the backyard. Pick up your things and scram. Get out of my sight. I'll tell you something, you and your friend both stink. Gutte. Gutte. Gutte. Gutte. Gutte. -Gutte. -Gutte... I'm coming. Max in the kiosk is looking for you. -He's stressed out. I'll deal with you later, you just wait. Well, bring the bombs. Lemon popsicle. Hey, you want lemon? Hey, lemon. Hi, Max, what's wrong? - Come closer, come. What's wrong? -Come here. Maybe you can explain to me, what's that? A bomba, huh? I didn't bring it. What do you want? -For you to be a mensh. As long as I'm responsible for this station, don't mess it up. Is that clear? And don't bring the fuzz here. And if you think that I'll bail you out again, then... Hey, stop hitting me. - Stop hitting you, huh? I should have broken your bones when you came here 20 years ago. Maybe then you'd have turned out to be a mensh. Look at you. What's wrong? I like it. - Shut up when I'm talking. Running around, dirty, unshaved, with hair like some beatnik. At your age people are building their lives, getting settled, What'll become of you? Running around with 2 brats. You're old enough to be their father. Aren't you ashamed? Ashamed? What did I do? - What? That's the problem. You've never done anything, you're not doing and never will. I raised you hoping you'd be a mensh. What became of you? Avi. Duvidke. Quick, quick, get up. A bomb. A bomb. -M'am, m'am, let go of my shirt. A bomb. A bomb. -M'am, m'am, let go of my shirt. M'am, if you don't mind, let go of my shirt. M'am, let go of my shirt, it's a present from abroad. M'am, it's not Fatah, it's Peeping Toms, rubbing, rubbing. OK, Fatah, alright, just let go of my shirt, let me go. Stop. I swear I'm going to kill you. What's wrong? -Peeping Toms. - Nonsense, it's a sickness. Hello, m'am. m'am... hello, Avi, Avi. Give her a mouth to mouth resuscitation. -You give her. Look. Oi, oi. Take it, take it. Hello, hello, what's that? - Fatah. Hi, Millie. -Hi, Gutte, what's up? -Don't ask what's up. I'm going to catch Avi or Duvidke. This time I'll skin them alive. They made me so nervous. Maybe because you don't sleep nights. -No, nights are OK, the days suck. -Hold the kid a minute. -Hello, Merav. I've got something here to calm her down. -Good for you. What's that? -When will you learn? 'Koktes'. -Koktes? Yummy. It's your mom's chilli - Just the way you like it. It burns twice this food. The first time when you eat it. God bless you, Millie, you're the only friend I've got. Yes? Lion, lion, he'll never finish. - Who's that? -Mrs. Sonya. Is your telephone out of order? - No. Why? I called yesterday, there was no answer. -Yesterday? At night. -Ah, we took out the nets to sea. Why did you call? 5 a. m. he didn't call, he didn't come home, I was worried. Don't worry, everything will be fine, Millie. -Right. How's the patient? -As usual. - Sleeping? -I don't know. Didn't he come home? -Came and went. -Ah, you quarreled. Did you have fun last light? - What fun? We drank a bottle and a half of cognac. Fun... -Alone? Alone? No, Ora was there. -Who's ora? Ora who pisses Passiflora. Pardon me, you've got a complaint against me? A complaint? -I thought I heard something. -You're crazy. Complaints about something so charming? What's so charming? - You and your friend. Look, you're 2 friends sitting alone every night for months. You look at each other. You don't fight with each other. You're not fed up with each other. It's charming. Cola. -It's not cold. - What? -Not cold, hot. Excuse me for a minute, am I your husband's dad? -No. Am I his mom? -No. -So you want me to kick him out? If I tell him to go, will he go? And if he goes, won't he come back? So that's it. He came last night, crying, with a swollen ear. One drink, two, he dragged me into it. What do you want? Why don't you open a garage? -Why a garage? This morning you dragged him, now he's dragging you. You get along so well. Millie, I'm asking you again, did I do something to you? Do I owe you anything? - Not at all. Did you marry me? Are you my friend? Not at all. Come on, don't start with the insults, 'cause I'm better at it than you. What's that, am I not your friend? -Are you? - Don't you know? Sure I am. Liar. -Hey you, when did I ever lie to you? You never stop lying to me. Even now. -What? You said you were my friend. - Well? Why don't you invite me to your parties? Will it bother you that much? Millie, I'm asking you, leave me in peace. Why are you coming to me? - Who's coming to you? -You. Ah, yes, I came. I brought you a pot. Sorry. Why me? What do you want from me? -Nothing. So what's wrong? - Nothing's wrong. So don't shout. If nothing's wrong, don't start. Who started? -You. You come here with questions. Am I your husband? Do I know? Was I ever married? Ask him. Maybe I'll ask his forgiveness too? I still have my dignity. Dignity. Darky. - Yes, yes. Primitive. Come here. -What? If someone's my friend, I'll never lie to him. Primitive. Marlboro. -Marlboro. How much? - You don't know? No. -3 minus 5. -What? - 2.95. -So say 2.95. Dignity. So you came here today to mess with my head? You're not from the kiosk? - Why? -No reason. What's wrong? -Nothing. -Can I have a soda? -Here. -Thanks. Great. -Thanks. Where are you from? -You? - Ramat Gan. And you? -Jerusalem. Jerusalem, huh? -Aha. - First time at sea? -Second. Want a ride on the boat? - I'm scared. What if I fall off? Don't worry, I'll pick you up. Keep an eye on the kid for a minute. And the pot. Come on, Meravi, we'll go to mom? Yes? Keep an eye on the kiosk. - I can't right now. Keep an eye on the kiosk. Come on, come on. With the 200 pounds and all the loans you already took, you owe us 670 pounds. - What? What? Not including the taxi Effie had to take yesterday, because you took Meir away. And a 30 pounds fine for being late for two shows. Don't mess with me, when was I late? What about all the shows this month? 670 pounds? All the shows and gigs add up to exactly 670 pounds. You want me to show you your card? Don't show me any card. Don't show me anything. What this office has to show I've already seen. If you don't like it... - Yeah, well? You have a choice, you know. - I'm doing what I'm told. Hello, Meir. Yes, honey. what choice have I got? You can... -Elli. - What do you want? How come you took the taxi with that stupid bimbo, and left me standing there like an idiot? Do I have to ask your permission? You dummy. Elli, cut it out. - You shut your mouth. Leave him alone. I told him to go. What about it? Wait, don't talk like that. Where do you think you are? I'll tell you exactly where I think I am. I'm here in a shit hole. I'm fed up with you and you, dummy. And you, lady. Bye. You've got a show today. - Really? Where? -Beersheba. You're wrong, honey, it's not Beersheba. Starting today I'll show you where you can appear. Here, up my ass, you dummy. Come on, Meir. Well? -What? -Where is she? - At the beach. -Who? -Millie. Not Millie, that one, Dina. - She went. Well? -Well what? No. - Ah? She turned me off, I don't know why. -Ah... -What's this 'ah'? What do you want? Tell me, what? -What's with you? Nothing. Mind your own business. Hello? Here, here. Come on, give her the money. I'm off. I'm not giving her any money. You give her. Don't be a shit head, give her the money. I'm not giving her anything, you give here. -Fuck you. How much? -It's alright. - Please. M'am, m'am, I pay for my pleasures. Chill out, baby, but you're right. You're right. She bore me a kid. I do the laundry, I go to the child clinic, I babysit and she goes sailing. What do you say to that? Good bye, dummy. Where did Elli go? -No idea. How was the blond? -Charming. Why d'you scratch him? -Idiot. Thought he picked up a sucker. Why did he go? Didn't he leave money? He did, actually. Here. - He's angry? -Why should he be? He's not angry at all. I'll tell you, he just lost it for a minute. That's all. Why are you so smug, Millie? - I'm not allowed to be? No, on the contrary. - Why are you so smug? I'm not, Millie. Get off my back, do me a favor. Aha... -Gutte. -What? - Calm your nerves. What nerves, baby? Do I look nervous? What nerves? Who's that? - My brother. Why? -Nice. You're the director of the sea, huh? You see what you got me into, Millie, I'm talking... Come here you. Go pour some water, go on... Go. I'll be coming with... - Gutte, stop it. Stop it. Calm down, stop. Stop it, OK? If I don't go in the water I'll go mad. Merav, let's go home. Altman, Altman, would you quit moving around? Leave the fish. Come sit here and we'll close the matter. Well, sit down already. Altman, I'm telling you, you can make a fortune here. Almost zero expenses. -Hi. Look at that. -Put it there. Altman, will you listen a minute? -Yes. Well, what? What? How many times do I have to explain? It's not just a discotheque, well, a discotheque too. A place where singers sing, records, the best you've got. The Beatles, John Lennon. - What's that? What's that? It's not a 'what', it's a 'who'. -OK. Who's that? Lennon from the Beatles, don't you know? -Bennon, Bennon... Ah, Bennon, Bennon, that's a different story. Bennon. Bennon, good for you. Discotheque, great. But understand one thing, my basement is a dump. Bennon won't help. It needs renovation which costs money. Who's going to pay? Bennon? Renovation? What renovation? How much can it cost? Quite a lot. -Altman, listen, just a small paint job. Listen, you put a phonograph... - Gramophone in the corner. Records, singers, I'll take care of everything. He'll take care of it, for sure. - Altman, and what comes in, we'll... you know what? You tell me. -Tell you what? How we divide it. -Divide? - Yes. -What comes in? I'm interested in what comes out, not what comes in. It needs renovation and that's expenses. Who'll pay, Bennon? -He's interested in profits not in expenses. Stop interrupting, will you? - He's a banker, you see. Your hair, you look like an ass. - What are you laughing at? I keep up with fashion. - Me too. Let it go. Listen. -Millie said... -I'm not interested. She wants you to... - Not interested. -Sorry. Doing a number on me. Does she think I'm a little kid? Fooling around in broad daylight. They know me here. I don't like these things. In your place, I'd go and tell her... What? What? I should go to her? Let her jump in the lake, OK? - He's a tortured saint... When I fool around I do it quietly, no one knows. Dummy. -You're saying you think she knows? She'll never find out. You're not only a dummy you're an idiot too. Shut up, you don't know anything. Beat it. I'd give him the Israel prize, what a performance. Beat it, you vermin. -Altman, listen... -Where are you? Where are you? -Rutti, my God, where are you? Come on, come on. I'm listening. Start talking. - Huh? Let's leave it for now. I'll come by tonight. - OK, tonight. I looked for you like crazy. - I was away for 2 weeks. Why? I was down. -You're up now? - I'm here, aren't I? Come to my place? -The cabin? - Yeah. -Now? -For 30 minutes. What's wrong? -Too much traffic. My husband will pass by, if he won't find me, he'll kill me. Come on. Screw your husband. - Right, screw him. Do you have a cigarette? - No. You want one? -No. It's healthy. 7 olives are 1 egg. -Make an omelette with 14. Oops. How's business? It's murder working in this heat and there's a lot of work now. It's the holidays, people like to go out, I guess. What holidays? It's this weather. -That's right. Your friend's horny, huh? He came down on all of us. On you? -What do you think? Especially on Rutti. Ruti's an old story. You think they'll get married? Better still, you tell me. Do you want to or not? -Me? No way. -OK, so move on. Don't disturb me on the job. Look what a jinx you are. Hello, Gutte. -Hello Dr. Schwartsman. -How are you? OK. -They won't let you live. - You'll be our hit man one day. Come on, that's your chance. - Wait. It's not my day today. Come tonight. -You'll be here? - Sure. -See you. Let's go. Hi. Would you wait just a minute? You'll pay for each and every item. Well, Altman, how's the little one? -Who? Well, you can see. How is he at school? - How is he at school? When he's healthy, the teacher's sick, and vice versa. If his mother were alive, he'd have killed her by now. I say, maybe he doesn't have time. He has to run around the showers in the morning. What happened? - Nothing. Dad. -Get him. -Dad. - Quiet. -Dad. Let's get them now. - Shut up. -Why wait? I know where they're taking him. It'll be alright. Your honor. On the 6.6.72, the accused, Mr. Altman, was seen... peeping through a hole in the women's showers. All that with a naked eye. In view of the grave sexual situation in this country, when hundreds and thousands of sex maniacs... are peeping and turning on... all the population everywhere. I'd like you to pass strict judgement on young Altman... also known as 'young Altman horny Altman'. Come one, the sentence. - I'm getting to it, your honor. In view of the mentioned facts, and me losing a day's work, I'm asking the court to castrate the accused as of this minute. Let me go. -Shut up, you idiot. - Let go. Cut it out. Oops. Get the clothes from the bonfire. Folks. For the fish, for the bombs and all the mess you're making at sea. It's just the beginning. He who wants to go home, come to me. Aren't you ashamed? Torturing a little kid like that? Look, he's in panic. -Calm down, Altman, just a minute. A little cold water and you'll be fine. -The other way, Gutte. The other way. The other way. Gutte. -Huh? The other way. Nice? -Very nice. -Now the other way is much nicer. Here he comes. -The other way. Look what you did? You whore. Gutte. Gutte. Gutte. - I'll go get him. Enough already. -Do you want me to bring you down, or don't you? Why are you crying? Come on, honey, get the dirt off and come here. Well? -Well what? -What now? - I don't know. Drink coffee. Go to the cabin, maybe? - No, it's hot. Maybe we'll go to Altman's. I'm starving. OK, we'll finish drinking and I'll hop home. She won't live to see that. She can jump in the lake. Samson the hero. - No, no, sir. I want to know. What does she want from me? If she accepts me as I am, fine, that's great. If she doesn't, I don't know. What do you want me to do? I don't know. I don't know, you're unhappy, I see, unhappy. -Shut up. Fine for you to talk. Do you have to account to anyone? You come and go, free as a bird. After meetings which have been held for so long, my conclusion is, you're a real vermin. You've got this woman. You're recommending my wife? Bravo, really. Shut up when I'm talking. Such a wife at home, a pretty thing, and you're sullying her. Elli, you're sullying her. - All of a sudden you're a saint? I'm no saint, but you're a sex maniac. You're... And you? You're better? What happened with Dina today? Dina, huh? Get out the drops. It's been along time since you've put them in your nose. Thanks for reminding me. - You're a vermin, a parasite. If God doesn't kill you in the morning then there's no God. Hi, Altman. How was it? Grownups. Aren't you ashamed of yourselves? Go on, get dry. Give me. - What? -Look at that. Altman, what's up? Come on, Altman, what's with you? -What? -What? Hey, did you see that instrument? That's an interesting thing... Altman, why peek in the showers with a thing like that? What can I do? - What can you do? Shove it. How old are you, Altman? - 15. -Come on, 15? It's still growing? What do the doctors say? What do you want? -What do I want? Something like that. Good for you, Altman. Do you know you can take him on a world tour? Yeah, Joselito the jackass. Nice. Altman, take off you pants. Let's see. -Go on. Altman, take off your pants. - Leave the kid alone. Kid? What kid? - Take your trousers, go home. Gutte, leave the clothes. Leave them, come on. Shut up, dummy. -He'll kill me. -Nobody will kill you. If you touch him, I'll break your bones. You hear me? What happened? -Nothing. So what are you doing here? - I just came. Something happened to the kid? - Nothing happened to the kid. Where is she? -At my mother's. Why are you in such a panic? You scared me right now. My heart dropped to my pants. I just felt like seeing you. Is it a crime? No it isn't, but I was so scared. Millie... stop it, come on, stop it... stop it, come on, enough. I thought you were with someone. Are you crazy? Gutte. Give me my clothes. Gutte, how will I get home? Gutte. Give me back my clothes. Gutte. Gutte. Cut it out, give me back my clothes. Gutte. Baby. -Cut it out. Enough with the jokes. Now you and I are going to have fun. Let's go. Gutte. Gutte, come on, give me back my clothes. You want your clothes back? - Yes. -Take them. -Nudists. You wait. -Gutte, give back the clothes. How can I go home? What kind of nonsense is it? - Gutte, cut it out... You stinking fat son of a bitch. Millie, it's too much, it'll knock you out. What's the point? - Let it knock me out. Pig... - So that's it? Look at your husband's staring. You see? If this dummy knew how much I loved him... Can I have 10% of this thing? You know that I love you. - Yes... -Ah. -'Ah' what? Tomorrow I'll cook for you... something special. - Something special... Don't cook something special. Say, what about a bone? That's what I'm interested in. - A bone? What do you mean? I mean, throw a bone to a friend sometime, that's what. Go on, go on. - Excuse me for a second. Yeah, what's up? - Can I ask you to dance? Go, go, you've got a Fred Astair there, by the steaks. If he's busy go to the beach, maybe the blond's waiting. You don't know what an idiot he was, thinking he'd fuck me. Well? -Well what? He came back looking like after a battle. And then Gutte punched him. Can you imagine that? He turned black in a minute. Great, I'm really glad someone's watching over my wife. What did you want? You weren't around. So... 'She closes her eyes and thinks about the sea. 'Building her own bars knowing it's not the whole world. 'She's sitting and thinking what to keep, what not to keep, 'And you go home, you always have a place to go to...' Let's make another baby. Millie? Millie? I'm going to get beer from Altman's. Millie? 'You always have a place to go to...' Ruti. -Hi. Altman? -What? - Come here. What are you doing here? Hello. -Hello. Well, how's the kid? What kid? That's a kid? What about you? -I'm on my way to the cabin. Just passing by. Come on. - You have a cigarette? If I catch you with someone else, I'll kill you. Where's Millie? -She was drunk, I left her sleeping. What's he doing here? - His opening number today. What? Altman, how was it? -I tell you, I'm through with peeping. Look how beautiful. Tourists from the hotel. Go home, Altman, what are you doing here? Wait, wait... slow down... wait... now. 'Peeping Toms'
