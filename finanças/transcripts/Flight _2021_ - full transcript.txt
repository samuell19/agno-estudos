warning, warning, warning We have lost contact with Speed Bird 815... I repeat… We have lost contact with Speed Bird 815 Due to a technical fault Flight 815 carrying 250 passengers… It is being said that the death toll has risen to 70 An incident that has rocked the entire aviation industry A political storm has erupted in India According to reports, most of the passengers in this flight were Indian Crowd: We want justice! No comments! Crowd: We want justice! Damn it! Let me wear my tie! Journalist 1: What about the DGCA enquiry? Journalist 2:The Airlines are blaming the Aircraft …your comments? I don’t want to say anything… no...no..... So viewers, as you saw that the crashed Flight 815’s manufacturing company… Adityaraj Aviation has also refused to comment on this incident. In order to shed a little more light on this subject, we have with us today, the Chief of Inquiry for DGCA, Mr Rawat. News Anchor: Welcome sir! Thank you! Till now no one has taken responsibility for this unfortunate incident How will we and our viewers know… who is responsible for this? But, for that we first need to find the Black Box Sir can you explain to our viewers what is a black box? The black box is also known as the Cockpit Voice Recorder.. Mr. Rawat: ..but just to be clear this is actually… red in colour Mr. Rawat: Basically it records all the data inside the cockpit of the plane… Mr. Rawat : Including conversations between the pilots, till just before a plane crash… Mr. Rawat:By listening to this, you can find out ..what the real reason for the plane crash was… and if it was caused by negligence… Would this Black Box not be damaged in the crash? No! Not at all! It is very difficult to damage it It doesn’t get damaged even in temperatures as high as a 1000 degrees… So like Mr. Rawat explained, now we need to wait for someone to find the Black Box. Only then would it be clear, that who is responsible for this catastrophe. Nathwani: Why don’t we just issue a statement ??? But let the reports come in at least… Are you saying we have never issued a press statement before? But before this, our equipment has never been questioned. We answer the questions! Not You! Khanna: Let’s not get personal... It’s a business decision after all… There is a meeting with the investors in Dubai today evening.. We’ll have to give them something But Mr. Khanna… How can we issue a statement without any verification? Farid Currim: What’s everyone else doing? No one in the entire airline industry is willing to take responsibility! We! The manufacturers, are the easy target! Nathwani: Exactly! If the landing is bad… the landing gear is blamed If the flight is bumpy…There is a problem with the design of the plane! And even if there is some extra salt in the food they blame the temperature control!! After all, we manufacture these planes !!! Let's assume we issue a statement, that there was no fault in our aircraft… but what happens when they find the black box… You don’t need to worry… We’ll handle it… I don’t think he will agree. Who ??? Ranveer? Who is he to decide ??? There is a board of directors and they will take a decision.. And let me remind you Mr Balraj.. that you are not one of them … You are just a substitute! Nathwani, he is the MD of this company And Balraj is representing him here Nathwani: Represent? The company is taking a hit on Page 1... ..and on page 3 this man is being seen gallivanting ! I repeat… he won’t agree! Well it’s absolutely fine if he doesn’t agree… But where the hell is he??? Dan: Make it fast guys… Dan: hurry up... hurry up! Capt. Flight 815: What the hell.. what's happening? Co-pilot Flight 815: Sir, air pressure’s dropping.. Capt. Flight 815: What do you mean… Can you confirm?? Co-pilot Flight 815: I think we’re flying too low Sir! Capt. Flight 815: How’s that even possible…it says 36000 feet… Move! Go! Ranveer: Dan! Why so serious??? Let’s put a smile on that face… Classic Heath Ledger! Always wanted to say these lines ever since. Thanks for the opportunity… Oh this? Well I could have left with it, but not thanking your employees is bad manners... and I hate that So thank you Dan... and good job! Sir!..You shouldn’t have come here! It’s my dad’s company! I come and go as I wish. Shhh…Shhhh! Hello! Good morning Baby! Just Shut up! Ya baby, you were saying! Give me a kiss no! What Baby? What’s this Shu… I’m just asking for a kiss! Come on, give it to me fast! Just a minute!.. Bloody… What’s all this noise? What the hell! This Paper… again! How many times do I have to deal with this? Now how do I clean this Sh..? Baby! Listen..listen Baby! Hear me out… Stop Babying me… are you not satisfied with one? Ranveer: Let me explain myself…you are not letting me speak… Ranveer: I can explain about the paper Listen, I was coming from the left, she was coming from the right.. She was wearing high heels, she tripped on me… and the paparazzi printed the same photo in the paper Paparazzi? Paparazzi??? You want to blame the paparazzi for this? But… Move… Move.. Move! Move… Move.. Move guys…Move! You know what? You’re going to die today… and I am not saying this… you can happily blame the Paparazzi for this too.. But.. what’s all that noise? Where are you? I am in a meeting! Ya right! And the board members are on the treadmill with you! How’s that possible! They are not that fit! Listen! Promise me… that you’ll come back in the evening and make up for this I am sorry baby! I have another meeting in the evening! Fantastic! Then I have a lot of time… Then I have a lot of time… and I have a lovely surprise waiting for you… And this time you are never going to forget to tell me before you leave… What are you saying? I left a voice note for you What? Where? Right there... Hi Baby! I am so sorry..I had to leave in a rush… Your Tuesday workout playlist is ready… And your coffee is exactly where you like it to be… All that is really nice! But where do you have the time for me? I don’t want this part of being Bruce Wayne’s girlfriend. At least Mary Jane and Pepper Potts had something to do… you know what Bruce Wayne’s girlfriend did?.... NOTHING! Really Baby! I am still talking to you in this situation and you feel I don’t have any time for you. Ishita: How would you have the time to spare, all you are bothered about is your meetings… Ishita: and there is always time if you know how to manage Oh… now I know what’s going on… Ishita: Now I understand which paper you’ve been talking about… Ishita: and this is definitely not the paparazzi’s fault… FREEZE! Ishita: Hello? Hello? Stop! Give me a min! Hello…Hello Baby! Baby are you there? Hello? Dan: Sir! Your girlfriend is too demanding! Sorry! He better agree with us… He can’t decide alone.. At least Mr. Malhotra used to listen to us… After all, our word also carries some weight… I think we should wait for him After all we are stakeholders Ranveer always creates problems for us… Well… You’re in luck Mr. Nathwani! Ranveer is here to solve all your problems Well... that’s a lot of importance! Relax guys! Take a seat! Well I am sure you guys recognise this black box! Where did you find it? Khanna uncle… Shahrukh Khan once said… Ranveer: that if you really want something in life… the entire universe conspires for you to have it… And the universe in this case was so sweet to us, that it landed this in our own warehouse. We’ll have to give it to the employees of Adityaraj Avaiation... Before the evidence could be traced, they brought it back home. I think we should give them a raise… or maybe... someone has already tipped them… Khanna: This is a very serious matter Ranveer! We must immediately have an internal investigation done. Of course we will, Khanna uncle. But before that… the reason that brought us all here today Capt. Flight 815: What the hell.. what's happening? Co-pilot Flight 815: Sir, air pressure’s dropping.. Capt. Flight 815: What do you mean… Can you confirm?? Co-pilot Flight 815: I think we’re flying too low Sir! Capt. Flight 815: How’s that even possible…it says 36000 feet here..and it doesn’t look… Co-pilot Flight 815: Sir! Look out! The pilots could clearly see the plane flying at 36000ft … and still it crashed into an 8000 feet high mountain… So Mr. Verma… if the pilots were not asleep… Who was at fault??? The Altimeter … Bang on, Khanna uncle! After a little bit of investigation, I also came to know … that since the last few years instead of our regular suppliers there is a new company named Falcon Corporation, that’s been supplying us with these parts.. because we get them cheaper… well… that’s a very good business decision I must say… And because of this great business decision… People died! People lost their lives.. It’s our fault! And now? We cancel all flights functioning with this part … and inform all the Airlines that we’ll compensate them if we have to… Are you serious?? Have you lost it? It’s 40 years of hard work down the drain! Did you see what happened to Air Going? Hardik: These days even if a single passenger has an issue… the stocks come tumbling down Avinash: And we are talking about re-calling all the planes.. Our stocks have already plunged 300 points We’ll lose everything! Instead of the Airlines, compensate the families of the victims… 2 million! 3 million! Give them more if you want… I had an eleven year old son… Who was on his first school trip …I WANT JUSTICE! My son and daughter-in-law were on their honeymoon… who knew that was the last time I was seeing them.. I am all alone now... I have nothing to live for… So Mr. Nathwani, if your son was on that plane, how much compensation would you have agreed to? Mr. Khan! can you convince this woman that the stock price of your company is more important than the life of her son and daughter-in-law??? Sameer! You lost your father last year right? How many millions can make up for your loss??? Adityaraj Aviation was built by one man, alone, based on his principles and hard work. If those principles can’t be followed, then this company is worth nothing. I’ll convince the investors… and whoever is accompanying me to Dubai, will keep their mouths shut… we’ll also issue a press statement from there Can you please book these extraordinary gentlemen on a safe flight? Because I know they don’t, but I do care for human lives… Khanna Uncle… Can you please send the papers of the Falcon Corporation deal to the Phoenix? Yes! And just one last thing… whoever sanctioned this deal… I am gonna… See you boys in Dubai! So gentlemen… Any airline preferences? Oops! An entire action sequence would have been wasted… Shall we? Hold on… What the hell is this ??? Why on earth are we paying these buggers such fat salaries..??? Huh ??? Sir we tried to stop him… but… Shut up! Idiots! Good for nothing… And you Mister…Have you ever seen the MD of a company get into fist fights with goons..? When is this going to stop? The day you take charge of the company… Not again !…Tch.. Son you don’t understand You don’t understand Dadda… You remember as a child, when I used to take the cycle out for a spin… and get hurt?… What did dad do? Your father used to lock up the cycle in the garage.. But? But… you used to sneak out in the night, steal someone’s cycle and go for a ride… and again come back with bruises... So Exactly! You can take away my toys … but can’t stop me from playing… That’s fine Son! …but you need to be care... Will you stop behaving like Aunt May??? oho! Just- Wow!!! Now that’s a mean machine !!! The Phoenix… Dad really put his heart and soul into designing it… Yup! Your father was an excellent pilot… but a better human being… Look! He treated this servant like his own brother… Stop this will you??? He always said… Hey Ballu! one day Adityaraj Aviation will make the best planes in the world… I miss him ….Had he been alive today …he would have taught these thugs a lesson... Don’t worry Dadda! you don’t need the High school Principal to handle these kids… This class President is good enough for them… But I promise you… I won't let him down… I know son… I had found a brother… and then lost him…. but he gave this bachelor a son… please take care of him… Dadda… If you wanna really see me fly… go raise the limits of your sky … Dad always used to say this… Son..once you come back… we’ll go visit the Gurudwara… Can’t expect a cocktail party from you ..Can I? What happened? Lovers tiff? Is it my fault if someone printed a nasty picture of me in the newspapers ? Of course they would want a young, handsome and smart celebrity instead of oldies to grace their tabloids… Of course… Trust issues… Mollify her… She is your favourite… why don’t you do it… And did I tell you… you are not travelling with me? Of course I know… We need someone keep an eye on these thugs Wow! You really are Aunty May … You already know what I want In any case, there are two beautiful hot girls waiting for me out there… why would I want you to spoil my fun… Sure.. You can only talk. How do I put it in your lingo … You are all fart… but no Shit! Sense of humor? Not bad… Not bad at all! Oh..Relax… Take care! Sir! Thank you! Have a safe flight son! Hello ladies… Lily: Sir, may I? Ranveer: You better keep it safe… Am I late? Just by 2 hours… Bang on time! ‘Vash Napitok…’. Your drink Sir! Dasvidaniya! It means Goodbye… Can’t blame me for trying! Are you trying to cheat with Mr. Balraj?? Why are the girls not trusting me today? This game is going on for years… You’ve also been around for years sweetheart… You know what? you can’t even make coffee without me in this plane… Hey! Don’t try to take advantage of my weakness… And just by the way… How was your father’s surgery?? He's fine!!!... You’ve already asked 3 times!!! Hey… Hey… I just wanted to make sure you did not splurge my money on your boyfriend. You’ll never change… I’ve got to go check on the Captain Ok! And just by the way… I’m going to go and get my own olives In a world dealing with water shortage, we have the audacity to use bathtubs… Sorry? Nothing… you’re looking beautiful! Thank You! Excuse me Sir! you had requested for some documents to be sent over? Thank you so much sweetheart! You’re welcome Capt. Sanyal: Good afternoon Mr. Malhotra, we request you to take your seat so that we can prepare for take off… We request you to take your seat so that we can prepare for take off… Ok… ok… I’m on my way! I am on my seat captain. Any more orders for me? No exchange of pleasantries today?... What’s the matter? Not in a good mood or you didn’t get your salary on time ??

Just kidding… Anything else for me?? Um… Please fasten your seatbelt Sir! He’s definitely in a bad mood Jennifer: Mr. Malhotra, welcome aboard the Phoenix. Before your departure may we have your attention, while our cabin crew demonstrate the safety features. It’s for your safety! Jennifer: To fasten the seatbelt, insert the metal end into the buckle as the cabin crew is demonstrating. Jennifer: To secure the seat belt, pull the loose end of the strap. To open, flip the buckle cover away from you. Excuse me Sir! Can I have your drink? We’re about to take off You shouldn’t drink at work sweetheart! Capt. Sanyal: Once again a very good afternoon Mr. Malhotra! Me, Capt. Sanyal, co-pilot Sharma, along with the cabin crew are here to serve you. Capt. Sanyal: Once the aircraft is airborne and steady at 40,000ft, you will be able to use your electronic equipment like your mobile phone and laptop. Capt. Sanyal: We will take approx. 3 hours and 10 min to touchdown at the Dubai airport. OK! Cabin crew… prepare to take-off! Capt. Sanyal:We are already late for departure.. That’s why in a hurry..

You will be chilling in Brazil with the hottest women on the beach sipping martinis. And going by Sherlock’s theory of deduction… This has been done by people who don’t want me to expose the truth behind FLIGHT 815… I mean this is not rocket science… cmon!

I wish I had replied to your last message… I wish I could attend to one more of your complaining calls I don’t even know if you’ll get this message… But if you do… Please don’t try and find me in someone else… because to find a person as smart and handsome as me is just not possible Khanna: Ranveer Malhotra… Khanna: Ranveer Malhotra… The M.D of Adityaraj Aviation… Faith and principles were words that his father… late Mr. Adityaraj left behind… and Ranveer represented that legacy. But with a heavy heart, I wish to inform you that he passed away in a plane crash today. After an internal investigation, we’ve discovered that he had signed some fraudulent deals which resulted in the tragedy called Flight 815. His decision not only harmed the company but also resulted in the loss of many innocent lives. On behalf of the entire staff of Adityaraj Aviation I apologise for all the losses caused. We will try to the best of our capabilities to compensate everyone for this tragic loss. May his soul rest in peace… How did you find the rehearsal? … of the press conference that I am going to have in Dubai in the evening… Nice no? Oh yeah! I wonder if you’ll ever be able to see this video… I don’t know… I think you‘ll watch it… you’ll watch it for sure Khanna: You are really thick skinned, exactly like your father… you won’t die so soon Oh yeah… what was that you said???… One man… who built this company… alone… on the basis of his principles… One man? Alone?? So were we f… Alone? Alone my foot!! What principles are you talking about?... What did you watch on TV last night?… You turned the boardroom into a bloody sitcom… All your father did was preach. We ran this company… we made it what it is today… do u understand? All alone… in a room I would get frustrated… I used to scream by myself… Here comes another idiot after his father, preaching to us about principles… and today? and today?… Today you just crossed all limits… ha ha fooling around with bloody wires… Oh yeah …yeah... you must be wondering how we managed to pull this off? Let me tell you and help you die in peace… We found an excellent pilot… Khanna: Who would switch your favourite drink… And then kill the co-pilot … Khanna: Block all communications, change the flight route… And shift the plane to Autopilot Khanna: And shift the plane to Autopilot Finish off the Cabin crew… So that there is no one to help you Then take all the evidence and leave you all alone… …and you were thinking this was a hijack??? C’mon… How cheap do you think we are? Think beyond… Think big! We’ll put you in your father’s plane and turn you into ashes at 30,000 feet.. And guess what… missing planes are trending these days! And now I’ll rightly take what was mine… With one foot on your father’s grave and the other on the news of you never returning back Thank you! Such is life… Ranveer… Such is life! Cheers! Enjoy the Flight! Sir… Sir the last message was relayed at 12:00am, before exiting Mumbai airspace… everything was normal. We have put all the airports on the flight route of Phoenix on radio alert… They are also checking, but no emergency SOS message has been received anywhere… Sir, we are doing our best. Do you see our plane out there? Do you???? Umm… no sir So save the story of your best efforts for your seniors. Sir, we have engaged our best teams in this search operation The world's most important plane is missing from your airspace… and your team is working like nothing’s happened!! This is your best team? I’m surprised you continue to expect from them. Excuse me Miss! What do we have? Greetings sir. This is the last radio message sent from your aircraft to Mumbai ATC at 12:00hrs. Captain: VICTOR TANGO Phoenix 461 GLF6 Alpha, to Control. We’re about to exit Indian AirSpace… ...co-ordinates 1200N 06000E Current altitude - 15000ft and climbing. Air speed - 500 kts. Entering Communication Dead Zone in about 3 minutes. Mumbai ATC: Copy. Fly and maintain 40,000ft. Contact Dubai ground control on UAE airspace at 25°N & 55°E ahead of approach. ETA 15:30hrs. Have a safe flight. Wilco. Out. That’s it?? Yes sir… As per schedule… they should have radioed us an hour ago… but… ...there has been nothing. Thank you! I want crew lists, check-in documents, pre-flight check reports, security camera feeds… anything and everything that we have on that flight’s record… and I need it immediately. Yes Sir! And whoever is on that plane… I need their history… if it doesn't exist… dig it out! Yes Sir! One last thing… Till we find the Phoenix… This information remains inside this room. Is it clear?? Yes Sir! Now move! Okay… those were not my last words… I’m still alive… ...playing golf… ...getting bored!! Ignore the golf playing part… But what else should I do?? What an excellent plan Uncle! He could’ve kidnapped me, burnt me, shot me! Would have cost him nothing! I mean… the oldest trick in the book… The world's most tried and tested plan… Bomb! Just blow me up with a bomb! But no… ‘let’s frustrate him!’ There are more ways to frustrate a person I mean I understand revenge… Iron Man 1, Iron Man 2… completely understand that… but the plane??? If you ever meet him… please ask him this… Does he even know how expensive this plane is? He had to give a long speech didn't he? but why the hell did he need to tell me there is no pilot in the cockpit! Now who will fly the plane??? And who will I chit-chat with??? Our plane took off from Mumbai to Dubai. This is where the Phoenix sent it’s last radio message from… and at this point… the Phoenix went off the radar. On a good day, the plane should’ve flown this route… and should’ve landed here by now. But that clearly did not happen. Between Mumbai and Dubai, there are a thousand radio towers along the coast belonging to several countries… if the plane had to go anywhere near them… they would’ve picked up something. But they’ve got nothing either. Which means our plane has gone off course and has drifted towards the sea… and whatever happened to the Phoenix… happened between these two points. Shoot! Pre-taxi check reports confirm all technical specifications as ‘updated’ Sir.. hydraulics, pressurization, transponder, electrical and autopilot features were functional Emergency equipment was also in place. Sir, as per the air traffic controller on duty, the take off was recorded as ‘smooth’… but his duty changed 15 minutes after the take off. Interestingly, the controller who took the next shift never saw the plane on his screen. Sir I think the plane went off the radar during their changeover. Because during the changeover… there is a 5 to 10 seconds window of ‘no eyes’ on the screen. And the Pilot? Captain Sanjay Sanyal… with 1st Officer P.K. Sharma. Their check-in security feeds have just come in… Stop! Capt. Sanyal is holidaying in Venice with his family right now… This photograph was taken 4 hours ago… Exactly at the same time when the Phoenix was taking off. So Gentlemen… our plane is not lost… it’s been made to vanish What? Wow!… What a wish… I should’ve asked for something better. If this is what you wanted to do… Why beat around the bush? I mean... Why all this drama? Whoosha! Whoosha! Whoosha! Focus Ranveer focus! Focus… Okay… my favourite color… ah.. Grey? Green? Red? Maybe matching colors? Matching matching? It's a red colored cylinder… so the red wire?… how do I… Damn!… Tony Stark would have flown off into space with this thing by now. That’s your problem… Hurtlocker was the film to watch… at least you would’ve learnt to diffuse a bomb… so much so for a being superhero fan boy. Ok… I think my family reunion in hell just got confirmed. Shut up!... Shut Up. Shut Up! Sir... Hmm… thank you… Match this with that one… okay?… Sir... 25mins after the Phoenix went off our radars, a military base radar in Somalia spotted an unidentified aircraft. They tried to contact the flight crew, but lost the plane again before any communication. Somalia?? My hunch was right. Sir we’re not sure it was the Phoenix Did you get what I asked for? Yes Sir. The office received an email this morning from Capt. Sanyal… saying he was back from his holiday and was ready to fly immediately. His fit-to-fly reports were already submitted. He was our regular pilot who flew the Phoenix, so the other stand-by pilot was relieved from his duty. We traced the Captain’s email… It came from our office. Sir, our security department also received a ‘lost Pilot ID’ complaint from Capt. Sanyal this morning. And? Security issued a duplicate ID immediately. Without verification? Sir, the order came directly- Wait a minute… let me guess… that order too came directly from our office. Yes sir. Sir, there’s one more thing… Ya c'mon… Surprise me! The Captain also got into an argument with the airport staff at the security check... when the staff asked for his baggage to be scanned- Tell me something... ...the co-pilot… what was his name? P.K. Sharma How did he not know that the Captain was not Captain. Sanyal? Sir… this is his first flight Sir we need to alert the authorities, dispatch teams, start a search op- No no no no no no no no... If the plane is really hijacked… then whoever planned this… is waiting to hear some news about it And we’re not going to give it to them till we know ourselves… so hold it! Have the board members arrived? Yes Sir. Investors are scheduled to meet in about 20 minutes from now. Ok. Listen up… You go there and... Do not let the meeting start till I reach there. Yes Sir! Shizz Cmon cmon cmon Cmon cmon cmon cmon! Get out, Get out, out! Sorry Tom Cruise, I was forced to do this come on! come on! come on! come on! warning, warning, warning Think Think Think… May day!

Yes Sir... Dadda! stop flirting with the woman… Hello?… Sir… listen to me carefully… you will need to turn on the transponder so that we can track you. Why don't you come up here and show me where it is! ‘Ana la ‘afham Balraj: Calm down Habibi I make planes... I don't fly them Talk me through it step-by-step. Press the first button to the right of the keypad in front of you. Okay… he’s online! Yes!! Rukhsana:Very good Sir Now we shall level you off ok? Extend the right wing flaps to 15 degrees, airspeed down to 110knots, flip the master and gently push forward on the stick— ‘Ana la ‘afham!!! I don't understand you!!!.. ‘Ana la ‘afham!!! Sir, your airspeed is increasing rapidly, the aircraft will start stalling… this is no time for joke Exactly! no time for joke! Slowly… steadily… Baby-Talk me through this… You see the Big lever in the center? Yes yes… Big Bad lever… Good! Pull it back slowly… ...till you see 110N on the display panel Display panel? There are 4 of them. Which one? The one with a lot of circles on it! Oh! You mean the Map Page with the Primary Engine Indicators? What? You won't find it there… it’s not part of the standard manual. Get to the point now!!!! Now push ahead on the center stick slowly Okay… Pushing… Pushing… Pushing… Do you see a panel with blue and brown colors? I mean the ..pri..Primary Flight Indicator I see all blue… no brown… no brown.. not even Dan Brown! You need to keep pushing on the stick till you see half of both the colors… Okay okay okay….pushing Leveled off! Levelled off! Very good. Now let go of the center stick… and enter these coordinates into the keypad. Mr.Ranveer, because you have a breach… Please try and maintain the same low altitude of 8000ft, or else there will be a decompressing pressure on the aircraft. That means? That means it’ll explode! Is that a warning or a threat? It's just information If I die after all this… it's because of you girl. Are you out of your mind? Do you even know what you’re saying? I pay you half in advance… and I clean up your mess too!!! How is this working? If Mr. Khanna found out about this he is going to— Mr. Khanna… it's the pilot… he wants the rest of his payment You call yourself a contract killer? One man… you could not kill ONE MAN He’s performing aerial stunts in front of the public out there and all you care about is your balance payment? If you ever try to call me again… I will pay twice the amount and have you dead. Buzz off!! Idiot! With all due respect Mr. Khanna… we could’ve done it the simple way… there was no need for this extravaganza. Making a black box disappear from a crash site was simple Don't tell me what's simple when you can't do it yourself. Don't worry… we still have a chance… The bomb worked as a backup. No one can survive that blast. Look at the time you idiot… ...the bomb went off 20 minutes ago. With this boy… it’s not that simple. I want him dead… I don’t know how… Sir, the investors are here. We have a visual!... I repeat… we have a confirmed visual. Phoenix approaching runway! Yes!! Rukhsana!!! Dispatch emergency services to runway no: 3 Yes Sir! Uncle is worried... He should be… wait till I land You’re almost there… Prepare to land son Finally! Mr. Ranveer... ...you have already been aligned with the runway The aircraft is equipped with an auto-landing feature. You just need to feed some values to initiate it. You know I love listening to you talk Ignore him Reduce speed to 80N. Ok You should see a black lever next to the center keypad You need to set it to 25 degrees. Now lower the landing gear by flipping the landing gear lever. Shizzz! What? It's gone… What?… Can you repeat? This aircraft does not have a landing gear anymore. Sir, you cannot land on the runway anymore, you will have to land on water. That’s not happening… It’s a lot to learn in one day! Mr. Ranveer… you listen to me or you die! Ok ok listening… listening Woosha... Woosha... Tell me something… ...does this run on anything apart from fuel? What? I just ran out of fuel This man.. Bad News... Sir, he’s not going to make it. The safest area for a sea landing is a 100 Nautical miles from here to avoid any casualties. But he does not have the fuel to reach there. Son... I know… We have a problem… Listen to me son… ...just Auto Eject We don't an option Dadda… I’m in no mood to die today Give it to me straight up… how much time do I have? But son... How much time we have? 5 min 5 minutes buddy… That’s a lot of time Dadda… Let's talk about something else. How’s your favorite girl doing? Still upset? Anyways… Who is our insurance agent? What? I mean I’m sure we’re insured… like accidental insurance or something… Ohh No No No… We don't? Yes we do but... You’re not going to do what I’m thinking!… Don't even think about it! Wow! Aunt May is back!… You got me there... Hey hey.. listen… son.. We can still think of another option Dadda listen... We have 4 minutes left... Let go of the emotion… It's time for some action. Sir, we have to evacuate. Now! Why? A short circuit has caused a fire outbreak on the 3rd floor So we have to leave... NOW! Ok You… take the investors down from here… I’ll get them out of the other exit. Sir let’s go.. Please follow me Everyone is going down. Why are we headed up? Sir, we’re going to airlift you from the terrace… that’s the fastest way to safety. Ok ok lets go! Where is the helicopter? Sir, your helicopter should be here in 2 to 3 minutes Meanwhile, I’ll go check on the rest of them. Ok ok go. Hello… There seems to be a fire in the building… I’ll have to call you back later Where is the helicopter? How the hell should I know?... You tell me! Hello… Mr. Khanna... Khanna: Yes… Someone wants to have a word... Yes... Whats Up Khanna uncle!!! Surprised? You were right… I am thick skinned… ...and I ain’t dying so soon That was one hell of a plan. I must admit… ...you almost got it right. You spent all your life trying to outshine my father… ...you forgot one thing, I am his son. I’m appalled by your confidence You’re still cocky knowing how this ends for you. In fact, you should thank me! You almost destroyed our company this morning. I’m the one trying to save it. Adityaraj Aviation does not need to be saved… Ranveer: All it needs is a makeover. By the way, if you’re expecting fireworks in the sky… you need to have the guts to look up. Confused? So let the fun begin… Holy mother! Hey Khanna … Khanna… Hey Khan... Chuck it, I’m out. Move! Move! Move!.. Quick!!!.... Hurry up!!! Such is life Khanna Uncle… Such is life. This one’s for you Lily! The job’s done… It’s time to come back.
