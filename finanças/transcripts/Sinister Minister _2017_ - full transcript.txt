I'm sorry, Trish. I didn't want to lose her again. She's very distrusting, she wouldn't tell me where she lives for fear we'd barge in. - DJ: She made me promise not to tell you before she'd even give me her phone number.

Detective Mann, what are you doing here? Sorry. I didn't realize anyone was here. I didn't see any cars in the garage, so I'm just looking about. Seeing if you guys were out here. What are you doing in here? Satisfying a curiosity. You're searching for something. You can't just search people's houses. Legally, outbuildings are more of a gray area, actually. Can I help you with something? DJ's first wife, Jewel, she hanged herself in her garage. I know that. I wasn't in Brightside at the time. But, Betsey I knew. Not well, but I met her at a function or two around town. She always seemed nice. Little timid. But, again, a nice person, a good person. Sick on and off. Uh-huh. When we pulled her body out of DJ's car, she had a lot of bruising, more than you would expect for a car accident. I wasn't assigned to the case, but I looked over the files. DJ had her cremated quickly after. So we weren't able to look into it any further. -I know he was in the accident. He had his injuries. And yeah, the car was smashed up pretty good. But, two wives? A man twice widowed before the age of fifty. It's not the norm, is it? What do you want to know, detective? Did DJ have any issue with the re-appearance of your ex? He was very happy to have him here. He offered to counsel us. -MANN: To counsel you? You mean to get you back together? Like marriage counseling? Wells didn't show up. To your counseling session? With DJ? Because he was dead. I don't know. -Of course. -Yeah. We don't know either. When a body decays like that, it's hard to know precisely when a person died. -MANN: You get a range is all. Did you love your ex-husband, Trish? Do you still? DJ's a perceptive man, Trish. I'm guessing that he would have gotten the feeling that I'm getting right about now. Wells was a real fly in his ointment. But hey, like you said, he was real cool about you two. That's great. Of course it's hard to know what person's really thinking. What's really going on behind the eyes. He's a good man. DJ or Wells? Alright, well... I'll leave you to it. When DJ comes back, let him know I'd love to chat with him. About what? About his wonderful life. -DJ loves me. He's taken care of me like a saint. He's the only good thing in my life, detective. You might want to think why that is, Trish.
