They better not try to start some shit up in here! I'm no punk bitch, okay? Okay? I'm Reggie Luv from the motherfucking up above. Preach. I will straight cut up a bitch up in here. You know how I do. Mmhm, sure enough, sure enough. Uh, Little Bo Peep, have you lost your sheep? You were excellent tonight. Merci. Isn't your mother looking for you? Shut up, you're so rude. God, I'm just saying. She don't care. Well fuck her. Come on and sit next to me, I'll be your mama. Really? Move, motherfucker. I swear to God, if it wasn't for the dick. So what's your name? Jonathan. I don't like that name. I'ma give you a new one. How about, Spain? Yes, I've always wanted a daughter named Spain. Okay. God is just answering all of your prayers tonight, isn't he? Yes, Lord. I am so blessed. Mhmm. All doctors to the ER. Reggie. Wake up. Reggie! Reggie! Yay! We are all here. Hey Luv. And guess who came all the way from college? Spain! Get over here and embrace your mama. What's up, Mom? Don't you worry about her. She just can't bear to see you like this. Matter of fact, don't you worry about anything. We got your back, you hear? Brought you a few things. I talked to that bitch Carmen in the rental office to let me in your apartment. You could be dead for all they're concerned, and they would still trip over that rent money. Oh, and I found your checkbook, okay? I just need you to give me the fiduciary duties to take care of your finances. Yeah, he's gonna handle that and take care of it, while Spain and I, we're gonna take care of you. We talked over everything. Ooh, guess what I brought you. Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Mr. Hamilton, did the orderly bring you your blankets? Oh I'm sorry. You all must be his. His family, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. What's going on with him, Miss Nurse? He was speaking when we brought him in. Something ain't right. He's not taking very well to the spinal taps, in addition to his pre-existing medications. This is all new for him. Give him a little time to adjust and he'll come around. Meningitis, is it? Cryptococcal. A common side effect is headaches, and that's why we had to administer the spinal tap several times. Yeah, had a couple of patients like this a few years ago. I'm an RN, I work over in Jersey. Really? Um, where? Cooper. Cooper, Cooper, heard good things about Cooper. Well, I guess we better get going. You know, I wanna hit the road before rush hour. We love you. Come on, Spain. Merci. Miss Reggie, I like this. No bitch, you can't have it. Well damn, I didn't even ask. But you was about to. You know I was. Fuck this, I'm hungry. Touch my turkey and I'ma beat your ass. So? You takin' too long, and we hungry. We hungry, we hungry, we hungry, we hungry. Y'all keep it up and none of y'all cunts will get fed. I will pull this motherfuckin' tablecloth right onto the floor. I'll still eat it. Not if I put y'alls asses out. Oh honey, you wouldn't dare. - Bitch. - Whose palace is this? Oh, that's right, it's Reggie mothafuckin' Luv's palace. I'm the queen up in this bitch. Now bow to me. No she didn't. Merci, merci. Come on, boo boo. Help me bring the rest of the food out. Gotta love that shit. Marco do not touch me. This shirt cost too much money for your greasy ass fingers, you hear me? Mother has taught you well. Where's Reggie? Where do you think she is? I asked a simple question, and I expect a simple answer, not some faggot ass remark. Whoa, don't be talking to my sister like that. She was just joking with you. He's a man. You nelly ass queens crack me up with that shit. Who you think you talking to? Who you think you hollerin' at? Oh no bitch. Marco, help Spain bring the rest of this food out. Can't stand those types man, I can't. It's all right baby, it's not even worth it. They came down to heal, not fight you. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to ruin your get-together. I know you didn't. Let me go before I start something that I ain't supposed to be doing. I'll bring you a plate? Hello. I'm about to snap up in this motherfucker. Reggie, honey, what? These goddamn motherfuckers stole my oatmeal cream pies. Look sir, I don't know what you're talking about. Mr. Hamilton, you have to calm down. They was in my drawer. My sister put 'em up in here when she came up here. You did put 'em in my drawer, right? It's two o'clock in the morning, girl. I don't give a fuck. I want my goddamn oatmeal cream pies, and I ain't going to sleep until I get 'em back. All right. I will bring you some oatmeal cream pies tomorrow girl, okay? Anything else? Yeah, some real food. What? Not this Jello ass shit they be servin' here. Is that it? A Pepsi. Okay, I will see you tomorrow. And stop givin' them people a hard time and go to sleep. Shit, damn. Crazy motherfucker. Randy! What's up darling? Bitch, get off me. Hangin' offa me, is you crazy? Welcome back. We got you not one... but... two boxes of oatmeal cream pies. Keep them in their bags and put 'em in the closet. Keep all my stuff in the closet. I don't trust nobody up in here. What the hell is that? Fried chicken, potato salad and greens. Who made it? Well, my mama made the fried chicken and potato salad, but I made the greens. Where's my baby Spain? Well you know, Spain started her new movie shoot today, Hollywood movie shoot. She'll be around, don't worry about it. Uh uh, I gotta get up out of here. Y'all know this is not me. This is not me. Amen. What you huffin' and puffin' for? Listen, maybe you should stay here a while. Look Reggie, you don't know this disease meningitis, okay? Leave it to the professionals. And besides, there's only so much I can do anyway. Duh, you don't gotta go throwing you profession all up in his face like that. Shit, I got my own spot. I ain't trying to stay dependent on you. Well, about your spot. Look, you know I don't care about taking care of your stuff, taking care of your finances from now until eternity is concerned, but... You've been evicted. What? Listen, you were nearly four months behind on your rent. It's not right for you to stay in a place that you're not paying rent for. No, I've been paying my rent. Give me the phone, let me call them. Give it up, because you're lucky they're not suing you. Well where's my stuff at? Well we took car of it, we put it in storage. Well where the hell am I gonna stay? I got it. O'Neil. What about her? She been living in that house all by herself since Sonia died. You used to watch her all the time when she was little. You know, you need to cut it out. Don't go there with me. We've already established this. Shit... this is blood. Luv has been here for us through the thickest of the shit. The least we could do is obey her wishes. Call the girl! I don't know, it's been a while. What, y'all got bad blood? Well fuck it, I'll call her then. Give me the phone. Uncle Reggie. How you doing, sweetheart? I'm fine. I'm so sorry, I just found out when Kevin called me last night. I feel so bad. Don't, it's all right. After not being around when my mom was sick, and being away at school, I can't bear not being around my favorite uncle when he's going through such a difficult time. Thank you sweetheart. That's the type of woman your mother was, strong and protective, always shielding me from the BS that the family had against me. Don't blame yourself. So, you thought about what I asked you last night? Oh yes, of course he can stay with me, no problem. And you'll be there to take car of him? I wouldn't do you like that. Oh no, no, I wasn't implying you would. So when are you getting released? I gotta talk to a couple people first. Okay, well just let me know so I can have the house all prepared and everything. Will do. So, what did you wanna talk about? I wanna go home. I'm serious, I wanna go home. You're definitely entitled to go home if you like. Your meningitis is clear enough. The only thing I'm concerned about is, the environment you're going to and if it's conducive to your condition and needs. The last thing we would want is for you to have to be brought back because things didn't work out. It happens more than people think. Will there me a caretaker for you at home? Yes, my brother Kevin. Is he licensed at all? No, but he's real good at this type of stuff. When my sister was in her last days, he was with her to the very end. He sounds like a great guy. I'm sorry to hear about your sister. Thank you. Well, I'll get the paperwork started and keep you posted. And if your brother can come in for one of your physical therapy sessions before you leave, that would be great. That can be arranged. Great. Mom, I'm out. Give Reggie my love. Put that in a bag. What, the basin too? Yeah, the cups, the basin, all of it. Damn, takin' all they shit, huh? I'm paying for it. Hello Mr. Hamilton, all ready to go? You Kevin? Yes. Hi, Brian Hirsch, I'm the resident physical therapist. I'm here to take you and Reggie down to the therapy room, do a couple of exercises. Oh, okay. On three, okay. One, two. Good. Is this process gonna take long, Brian? Not long, maybe about 15 minutes, I'll bring him back. Nah, there's no need. Just meet me out front when y'all finish, okay? Okay. Ok, I need to you take Mr. Hamilton and put him in that chair there. - Right here? - Yep. Okay, now take him and put him back in the wheelchair. That it? Hello Mr. Hamilton, Brian. Hey girl. Hi Miss Foster. And you must be Kevin, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. I need for you to sign these papers. They're your discharge papers. Can I sign those for him? Mr. Hamilton, is that okay? Are we done here? Yeah. Back to your room, Mr. Hamilton? No, we have a ride waiting outside. Well, let me walk you guys out. Thank you. You're welcome. If you need me for anything, give me a call, okay? I straightened up as much as I could. Oh no honey, I'm not lookin' at that. I'm lookin' at this Cosby Show couch. Yeah, this furniture has been here as long as I can remember. I went with your mother when she bought it. That was 25 years ago. Well we gonna have to bring this place into the 21st century, because this decor is not working for me. You enjoying your pina colada? Yes. But I ain't gonna lie, I'm missin' the rum. You know I used to down like three of these bitches in half an hour? Well once a drunk bitch, always a drunk bitch. Bitch, I know you ain't taking. This bitch used to drink so much he'd be drooling at the mouth. No, I didn't. Nasty bitch. I don't know what she's talking about. I've always been a responsible drinker. Bullshit. Ooh, that's my song. Very nice. I would have never thought of putting bedsheets on the couch. It looks great, it looks like brand new furniture. Number one rule of interior design, reuse and recover. That's how I make my living. You're an interior designer? What type of stuff have you done? Well, i'm working on starting my own business. It should be open soon. Cool. Well as I've mentioned before, I'm working on my degree in psychology at Villanova. And I'm also engaged. Oh! To that thick nigga that was in here earlier? Well, congratulations sweetie. You marry that man, and stay in school. Lord knows, I wish I'd have stayed in school. But I was too cool for that. Oh, I didn't know that, what did you study? Culinary arts. Ooh, child. Reggie used to throw the best dinner parties. No one, and I mean no one, could touch him on the stove. Girl, we should throw another one. You know I was thinking about that earlier today. Well let's get it. I'ma call Nate, Jojo, Devon, Henry, Hawkins. Invite all those heffers. We gotta set a date. What you thinking? How about the first Friday of the month? I'll have my check by then. Yeah, yeah. Well now I definitely gotta fix this place up. These are some real critical uppity bitches we talkin' about. We are going shopping tomorrow. I was never much of a Big K kinda girl but, Kevin is sure spending a lot of time in there. I'm sorry, one second. Hello. Hey baby. Yeah, I'm just out with Uncle and Kevin, shopping. All right, okay, all right. I'm gonna hang up now. I'm gonna call you back, okay? I'm calling you back, bye. Pop the trunk, girl. We got a computer. Bye. Who was that you were talkin' to? Them? Those were my business partners. Hey, um, this is Reggie. Call me if you get this message, at this number. 215, 555, 6782. All right. Where you going? Out, with the girls. What the hell? I thought you said you was gonna stay with me tonight. Ooh, I said that? I'm sorry. Spain is competing in his first ball tonight, and that is a mandatory affair. So now what? You're picking your friends over me? You're picking some gay ass ball over me? Excuse me? You heard what I said. Look, I don't have time to deal with this shit right now, okay? So, everything I say to you is shit now? What am I, shit to you? Is that what you think of me? Hello, we are here. Where the hell do you think you're going? Answer me, goddammit. Like I said, since you didn't hear me the first time, out! Y'all ready? Um, yeah. No, Spain baby. Who did your face, this is too much. I did. She wanted to do it herself. Ain't no child of mine going out there looking all busted. Come on y'all, let's go. We'll fix this on the way. I'm so proud of him. I could almost cry. So, what was that all about at your place today? Just a little dispute. Well it didn't sound that little to us. Look, we've been talking, Reggie, and we have a few reservations about Lenny. Yeah girl. It's cool you have a man and all, and we happy for you, don't get it twisted, but he be stressing you out. Yes, he has a bit of a temper. He's entitled to be that way. Look, he's my man and I'm his. Whatever goes on in our relationship is our business, so I'd appreciate it if y'all stay the fuck out of it. Kevin? Kevin? Kevin! What? Wait, wait, what's going on? I forgot that my house was getting painted today. Let's go to the library, it's right down the street. Okay. Kevin? What? I want a pizza. What, what, what? I want a pizza, order me one? A pizza? You don't need no pizza. I'm making fish. Fish that you requested. But I don't want that. I want a pizza. I ain't ordering shit. Fuck it, I'll order it myself. Give me my phone. Hey. Hey sweetie. Hey Kevin? Hey girl. I thought we made an agreement that he wouldn't be in the common areas during the day. I came in today and you were helping him, you know. Oh, that was you? I'm sorry girl, I thought it was the mailman or somebody. My friend was with me, what if he saw? Okay okay, I got it. I'll take him upstairs tonight. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye. Sweetie? I ordered a pizza, you want a slice? Maybe later. Who is it? Oh my God, you will never believe who it is. Your new home, it's quite charming. We're preparing for Reggie's welcome home party, which, you're gonna be there, right? I wouldn't miss it for the world. You ain't gotta be adjusting yourself like that, you look all right. I see miss thang here done upgraded to butch queen. Girl no you didn't. Still ain't shit. Your fashion sense may have improved, but it will never be as good as mine. Me and you still... Uh uh, don't go there. You know how Reggie is. Ain't nothing changed. Why are you here? Well, you know, I didn't get a chance to see you in the hospital and everything, so I figured I, oh, hold on wait, before I forget, 'cause I can't stay long, here are your prescriptions, Spain asked me to drop them off. No the fuck she didn't! Look, she says she's do busy to stop by, ain't got nothing to do with it. Ain't it time for you to go? Well yes, unfortunately it is. But it was good seeing you though. Oh, do you mind if I bring a friend to the party? Who's that, your mother? Actually no, his name is Lenny. Now it's really time for you to go. I'm joking, I'm joking. Bye. What is going on with Luv today? This isn't characteristic of her. She's been like this since last night when that bitch Jojo came over to the house. This heffer had the nerve to bring up Lenny. Oh. Bitches be gettin' carried away, I tell ya. Look, we might have to sign her up for CTT Connect, okay? Listen, I won't be able to take you on her appointment for the fourth. I'm gonna be out of town that week for a conference. So you ain't coming to the party? Well, I guess you gotta do what you gotta do. But I can't have Luv up on no stinky bus. And where the hell is Spain at? This is her mother. She should be here doing what I'm doing. Did you know she had Jojo bring over. Luv's prescriptions last night? Talking about, she's too busy, mhmm. I bet she ain't too busy for the 46-year-old married man. Now didn't I tell you, don't mention that around Luv. What? I can't help it. Like I said, bitch has been gettin' too crazy. Hold that. It's gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be okay. I'll be back. What's going on? Who is that? It's Spain, his step-daddy's trippin'. He gonna be living here from now on. Can you pass me a pillow? Can you please pass me a pillow? You can put these on, and I'll be back to bandage that cut up. Are you out of your fuckin' mind? He ain't staying here. Oh yes to hell he is. I live here too, you know. You can't make these types of decisions without me. Do I get any consultation when Anise come to visit? And do I ever make a complaint about it? That's different, she's my daughter. Well that's my daughter! And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let some grown ass man punch her in her face because she wants to wear a pair of pink jeans. Over my goddamn dead body will I let that continue. See, there you go again. Everyone else before me. You're ridiculous, do you know that? Absolutely ridiculous. I can't help it if I wanna put that little boy underneath my wings, or got to, as you put it, gay ass balls and kick it with my girls. I am not gonna stand here and say I have a problem with the way I live my life, because I don't. It's not my fuckin' problem. Where you going? Obviously, to you, I got a problem. So why should I even be here? Reggie, honey, you okay? Yeah, I'm all right. You sure? I called him. Who? Lenny. Are you serious? For what? I feel like I need to apologize, you know? For what happened. Ain't no need to open up that can of worms, and it ain't damn sure no need for you to apologize. I didn't reach him. I doubt that's still his number. Good, so there's no need for you to call again. What you doing? I'm looking up storefronts. I'm thinking about starting up a boutique. Storefronts? Yes, for my business. You're really serious about this business thing, aren't you? Whatever gave you the impression that I wasn't? Well you have my support. Thanks girl. Yeah, I think I'ma need some water. All right. Did you see that? See this is what I'm talking about. Yo, I'd appreciate it if you'd put on some clothes when I or any of O'Neil's friends come here. Oh, Miss O'Neil, is that how you feel? That would be nice. Well, for future reference, if you have a problem, or preference, or whatever, I'd like to take it up with you, and not Thickums. What'd you say? Stop, just stop. Wow. It looks amazing in here. Thank you sweetie. You guys are gonna have a great party on your hands. You're not staying? It's Jorel's birthday tonight. I'm taking him out to eat. I don't think he'd be too comfortable here at the party. Oh, I understand. Well, if dinner ends early tonight I'll definitely be coming back. From the way you and Kevin talk about the old parties, this thing will go all night. Don't worry if you can't make it back. Have fun with your man on his big day. See you later. Who was that? That was O'Neil leaving. Oh, she ain't staying? It's her man's b-day. Hello. Well well well, surprise surprise. Reggie, it's your daughter. So when you think you gonna get here? All right, but don't be late. She said she gonna be here. Ooh, that's my jam, turn it up. You want something to eat? Let me call a couple of these bitches and see where they at. Bitch, where you at? Hm, you ain't tied up, you just don't wanna come. You hungry? You should eat, you ain't eat since lunch time. I don't want any food. As a matter of fact, throw that shit away, don't keep none of it! Put it down. Ain't it nice today? Are you still worried over that party? You need to get over that shit. Bitches are two-faced, what you gonna do? This is a bill from Comcast. Wonder how they found you. Did you tell 'em this address? Oh... this is a bill for $460. Four months past due. You need to pay this before it goes to collection. I'll wait 'til Marco gets back. No, this needs to be paid immediately. You can't afford to wait. If it's four months past due, how worse can it get? Well I'ma pay this, and I don't care what you say. And I'ma pay any other bill that's due. You can't afford to keep waiting on Marco. From now on, I'm your new financial person until he gets back. I'm sleepy, take me inside? The streets are alive with the sound of music, fun and pride at Philly's annual Gay Pride celebration. Coming. To dance and cavort, all in the name of equality. Hey Mom, what you watching? Brought you something. It's my party gift. Sorry I couldn't make it. As you know, I just started a new internship with Sony Pictures. They were behind on a lot of scenes yesterday due to the thunderstorm. You think I'm stupid? Huh? You're a damn intern. You're there as an extra hand, you're not obligated to do anything. I know... I've interned before. I was just doing what you told me. To go the extra mile if it helps me get ahead. I have no reason to lie to you, it's the truth. Bullshit. You've been creating excuses ever since I got sick, not to be around me. Getting Jojo to drop off my medicine, not helping Kevin out one bit. And then, you come up in here a month after I get out the hospital with a bottle of champagne, acting like it's all good. I can't drink that shit. I never said that I would be able to help you as much as Kevin. He volunteered my time without me agreeing to it. Uh uh, don't put me in this. But did I tell you that though? Oh, you don't have to tell me anything. That's your mother, that's your obligation. Oh my God, I don't believe this. Don't believe what? Me? For lifting you up? For putting my relationship on the line so you could be safe? What happened between you and Lenny had nothing to do with me. You know what? Since you don't wanna be around me after everything I've done for your ungrateful ass... I never said that. You can get the fuck out. And don't worry about looking the fuck back. Go be with your married ass man. That's until he drops your young stupid ass. I appreciate everything you've ever done for me. More than you'll ever know. You fucking? Come on, bring that ass. Hello, anybody home? Y'all giving free HIV tests here? Yes, would you like to take one? We both would. Jen here will give you some paperwork to fill out, and afterwards, I'll administer your tests. Can i fill them out for both of us? I'm sorry, we're pressed for time. Sure... but only he can answer the questions about his sexual history. What's your name? Jonathon. Jonathon, is this your first HIV test? I'm trying to get his in the habit of getting tested, what is it, once a year? Every six months, actually. The Center for Disease Control & Prevention recommends getting tested as frequent as every three months. Damn, that's a lot. Well with the growing advancement in medicine, it is believed that HIV could possibly be prevented of we kept an eye on it, so to speak. Therefore, specialized testing like prophylaxis could be used to prevent people from contracting the disease, if exposed to it. Now of course, there wouldn't be a need for any of that if people actively practiced safe sex. Vaginal, oral, and anal. Although the risk with oral sex isn't very high. Okay, are you ready? Open your mouth. All done. Now see, was that hard? Are you ready? Open your mouth. Boy, would you put that camera down? All done. Now it'll be about 20 minutes for the results. Any questions? Nope, can we go outside and watch the festivities? Of course. Jen will bring you back in when it's time for your results. Your test results are ready. All right gentlemen. Now, would you like to hear your test results together or separately? What, no. Can you just give us our results so we can go? Yeah, sure. Jonathon, you tested negative. Keep it strapped and you'll stay that way. Mr. Hamilton... you tested positive. What? Give me that fuckin' swab. Here are some cards with our pamphlets and information on the back. Our address is on the back. I strongly recommend that you go down there for testing. I can set up an appointment now, if you like. ♪ Keep me in my heart ♪ My love has gone away ♪ And tell me true ♪ My heart is new ♪ My love has gone away ♪ It's okay, I know someday I'm gonna be with you ♪ It's okay, I know someday I'm gonna be with you ♪ Speak to me, my heart is free ♪ My love has gone away ♪ Tell me true You got what? You nasty motherfucker. You fucking infected and you bring that shit around me? ♪ It's okay, I know someday I'm gonna be with you I think you should go get tested. Lenny, Lenny! Stay the fuck away from me, all right? There's no way we could have predicted this would happen. We? What do you mean, we? You mean you. What's that supposed to mean? I ain't no ho. I only been out for a year. Who the fuck you calling a ho? Who you been fucking behind my back, huh? Who the fuck you been fucking behind my back, huh? Nigga, you expect me to believe that because you only been out for a year, that I'm the only person you've fucked? Nigga, you need to get a serious fucking grip if you think that I'm that stupid. Don't touch me, don't put your hands in my face. What? Or else what you gonna do, huh? Hit me in front of all these people? Don't tempt me. Yeah, run away. Run away like you always do. And then, he threatened to hit me in the middle of the street. No he didn't, child. Yes he did. And then he ran. - What? - Like a straight-up punk. These motherfuckers keep forgetting that I'm Reggie Luv from the motherfucking up above. That's right. I don't succumb to nobody. I'm gonna get another one. That's right, mhmm. Reggie motherfuckin' Luv. Work it, girl. Reggie Luv from above. Right on, girl. Mm, fierce. Work it, work it, work it. You wanna fuck me? Wanna fuck me hard? Yeah, that's it. What the fuck? What the fuck? Lenny get out of here, didn't you move out? Just as I thought, you're a fucking ho! Get out of here with that shit. Get the fuck out, shut up nigga. You think you can just do shit to me? Dismiss me, and expect to get away with it. Think he told you to get the fuck out. Yo man, don't put your hands on me. Don't touch me. Lenny, stop. Lenny, stop. Lenny, stop! Wait, Reggie honey, open the door baby. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. What have I done, I'm sorry. Open the door. Police, put your hands behind your back. Calm down. Are you sure you don't wanna give her a check? I don't anything of mine to bounce. Oh, aren't you a good uncle. It's the least I can do for her. For allowing me to move into her house. That's true. Wait right here. You don't have enough money in your account. What? There should be enough in there. I'll figure it out. Wait a minute. You wrote a check for $1,000 last week? A thousand dollars? What's going on with my money? Hey, you here. Reggie finally managed to pull you away from that consuming ass job. What the fuck's going on here? You stole from me. Stole what? Don't play dumb. You stole from me. Valducci Brothers, is what it's called. Those are my business partners. Bullshit! You ain't got no business. You ain't never had no business. We know what the fuck is up. Whatever happened to you offering me support? I meant moral support. What difference does it make? It makes all the difference. You're supposed to be my best friend, and you pull a damn stunt on me? Who the fuck you think you are? Oh I don't need to hear this shit! You're a thief. You're a liar and a thief. Use your own stolen ass checks. You ain't have no problem when I was using them stolen ass checks to buy all that food, all them linen, and everything that you needed. Pump your brakes, 'cause you fucked up, and you know you done fucked up. Now you need to pay him his rent money. Rent money? This house is paid for. That's beside the point. Listen, you need to pay him back, Kevin. And how am I supposed to do that? Look, he's sick right now. He's relying on you. He doesn't need to be agitated. Luv honey, don't worry about it, okay? I'm a take care of the rent. I want you to get some rest. Lift up your arm. - Lift up your damn arm. - I can't! How do you expect to get better if you don't even try? - I'm trying, it's hard. - No, you're not trying. If you were trying, I wouldn't be here wasting my damn time. Not so rough. Do you wanna do it? Okay then. Now... do you have to go to the bathroom because I am not getting up in the middle of the night. I don't want the blanket. Kevin, can you pass me the remote? Kevin? Kevin? What? Did you put my antiretrovirals in here? There's only three pills in here. And none of them look like my antiretrovirals. And there's some other meds missing too. I don't want that. You know I have to take my meds with a meal. Why didn't you put them in here? Look, I thought I did. I don't get it. You've done it before and gotten it right. Shit! There, you got your antivirals and everything. Why are you acting so stink towards me? I cook for you, I clean for you, I take you to the bathroom. I wash your ass. I'm tired of this shit! I got a life of my own, you know, and I think it's time I get it back on track. Honey. Going back to live with your folks, ain't life. For your information, I have a life that you know absolutely nothing about. So don't push me, honey. Because I will show you just how important it is. Whatever. Go take a nap or something. You take a nap! I will. Right after I eat a little bit of this food, and take my meds. You go right on to sleep. Kevin? Kevin? Kevin? Kevin? Kevin? Kevin! What the hell is that smell? Oh my God, Unc, are you okay? Are you all right? What happened? I hate myself! Hello. Hey O'Neil, how you doing? I'm okay, just fixing up something to eat. How's he doing? Oh, he's good. His attitude is a lot better this week. That's good. Have you spoken to Kevin yet? No, I haven't talked to him yet. He hasn't responded to any of my messages. I know, I hate to keep asking you. It's just, I haven't been to class in three days. I understand, O'Neil. Believe me, I understand, trust me. What I'll do is, I'll go ahead and stop by Kevin's parents' house tomorrow, okay? O'Neil? He's calling me, I've got to get this food up to him. All right, no problem. If you need me for anything, for anything at all, don't hesitate to give me a call. Thanks, bye. I see you didn't take after your mama in the kitchen. But that's okay, thank you. Thank you for everything. Good morning, sunshine. Hey. What time is it? Ooh, it's nine. Nine o'clock? I'm supposed to have been outta here to meet my lab partners. You'll make it. That's easy for you to say. I'll be back. All right. Uncle Reggie? Oh my God, Uncle Reggie? Jorel! I don't know what's wrong with him. He's not talking, he's not responding. Reggie, can you hear me? Can you understand me? Reggie, can you hear me? Who are you calling? Marco. Why you calling Marco when you should be calling 911? But he's a nurse. Call 911. You're gonna be okay. Just try to relax. Try to take some deep breaths. He had a seizure. She doesn't want him back in the house. Hey Luv. Listen, I spoke to the doctors and they wanna keep you, okay? They just wanna run a few more tests, all right? Don't worry about anything. When you get out of here, we're gonna find you a nice home. All right? Come here. Hey. Hey buddy. You're looking good. How you feeling? I see you like poetry. Yeah, I used to write a bit in high school. That was a million years ago. What? You're a young guy. Well, younger than most people here. Thanks. I'm Ralph. Reggie. - Good to meet you, Reggie. - Good to meet you too. Come in. Hi Mr. Hamilton, how you doing? Girl, what you doing here? Well, I was visiting one of my clients who happens to live in the building too, when I found out you live here now. So when I found that out, I just had to pay you a visit. Who told you I live here? Believe it or not, you are very popular. Story of my life. So, why didn't you call me? I gave you my card and I said if you ever need my help to call me. Girl, I don't know. I just don't know. So what you up to? On my way to the community center. I have a performance today. Wait wait, let me help. Can you pass me that book right there? Sure. Poems for love. Artsy. - Hey girl. - Yes. - Can you turn me around? - Sure. Thank you for attending this month's talent showcase. Tonight, we have a new resident who wishes to grace us with his charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent? How you doing, Reggie? Give a round of applause for Mr. Reginald Hamilton. Hi. I'm gonna be reading an original poem, titled Luv Don't Live Here Anymore. Hi, I'm looking for Luv. Does he live here? That his car? I swore I saw him through your window. But then again I was away, far. But it was Luv, I'm sure. I know that face. His fashion sense, that walk, his pace that makes the girls gag, honey, in devastation. Never one to avoid a confrontation, for a reputation must be upheld. Too stubborn to see the fallacy of people and things he prized to the utmost degree. Who is he, really? Luv. Now I'm not so sure I know. When I risked everything so he could grow. So I'm here asking this burning inquiry, when I should be asking, who am I? Me. I'm sorry for bothering you. I didn't mean to knock. I just remembered, Luv don't live here. He used to live on this block. ♪ Ain't no trouble 'til there's trouble ♪ Ain't no sorrow 'til tomorrow ♪ Seen 'em live and lie in rubble ♪ Looks like tomorrow stole our lives away ♪ Ain't no gift when no one's giving ♪ Ain't no life when there's no living ♪ Ain't no ring if no one's ringing ♪ Ain't no song if no one's singing ♪ I can see the falling graces ♪ On a hundred thousand faces ♪ I can see the closing door ♪ And a hundred thousand more ♪ Teach me the song and now we'll sing it ♪ Show me the bell and now we'll ring it ♪ Because I'll show tomorrow
