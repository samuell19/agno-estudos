(pounding drums) We love you GG! GG! GG! GG! GG! Here is the, er, resting area of GG Allin. Right here. This was where his headstone... stood until some jackass knocked it off the platform here. And then, er, the Catholic priest decided to keep it, hold it hostage in the basement of the church for... oh, seems like two or three years. I wanna forget about that stone. I haven't been to the cemetery for two years because it hurts to go without that stone there. I've been going there since I was 17 to see my father with that stone. And now when that stone isn't there it hurts when I go. It hurts because of all this foolishness with GG Allin and Merle. All the stupidness is the reason that stone is not there. (punk rock music plays on stereo) We're going to see GG Allin's grave. And where is it? We think we found it. It's up by...

All right, we have a customer from Canada here that wants to know if I can ship something to Canada. "Son, I can ship something up the fucking crack of your ass if you want me to." These are some of the pictures that I paint. This is just an original. I painted that. I saw a picture and I painted it. I don't pretend to be an artist. I just paint for the fun of it. I have a good time. Merle wanted me to do pictures of gravestones and things like that and, er,... I don't think that anybody would buy them for the picture. They buy them because I'm GG Allins' mother. I need to... try to forget Kevin Allin. I don't need to be reminded every day that he's dead. It's hurtful. It hurts my heart. And I have enough heart problems, so I don't need to think about that all the time. So here we are. We've entered the music room. This is the room where I keep all the GG CDs, the DVDs, the video, records, the patches, the stickers, things like that. A lot of GG Allin merchandise. Bumper stickers, stuff like that. Kevin is still alive to him. It's almost like not wanting to admit your brother's dead. And if you stop selling his things, and stop talking about him, he would be gone. GG and I were, like, real close from the time we were born. We lived in a log cabin. All alone in the woods without any phone or any way to get anywhere. Don't ever remember having people over to our house. There's no room for company. We were very poor. Very, very poor. Because their father didn't work and he always had to have a new truck. We didn't have a lot of money for anything else. Me and my brother entertained ourselves the best way we could. This is my secret GG Allin room. This is... where I keep my brother's memory alive with pictures and photo albums full of scrap book memorabilia and stuff like that, some of his prison artwork. This room is pretty much off limits to everybody. This is my secret... escape room for just me and my brother. (doorbell rings) Hello, sir. - Nice to see you. again. - You too. Come on in. Follow me, I think it's in here. - This is a shirt that GG wore. - Oh, shit. It's got a bit of a hole in the back, but that's GG's shirt. Wow, man, I am touching history right here. Holy shit, that's pretty insane. I'm so interested in that. Like I said they're, you know, expensive, you know. Yeah. The first ten years, I grew up in the woods in New Hampshire. With no running water, no heat, no, er, electricity. And my father was a very violent man. But that made me sort of a warrior soul in an early age. When things started to be scary I left for the children. I never saw him after that. I never talked to him. Except when Kevin died. He was the first person I called. But he never showed up. ♪ rock music plays ♪ When my mother finally broke away from my father and we ended up moving to Lancaster and moving in with her mother, we were like, "Wow, freedom, and excitement."

There was just something there. Two people with a lot in common. There was just a connection there. She is sort of like a Kevin to him. The two of them... that's all they need is each other. They don't seem to go out and socialize or do anything. And I think that Annie Teal and he... Like I say, she kind of took over Kevin's place. Ann told Merle she would have a baby, if he wanted one. I just don't think it's gonna ever happen. I'd sure like another grandchild. It's so sad I only have just one grandchild, Nico, my dead son's daughter. I brought her up for the first three years of her life. Bought all of her diapers. I was never close to Nico. And GG sure as hell wasn't. He left when she was three years old. He was a rock star. Her mother hated Kevin. And that's probably why she doesn't have anything to do with me. She's all I've got left of Kevin, you know. How nice it would be, if we could have a wonderful relationship because she's his daughter. She's... I don't have him any more. But I could at least have her. Tell me, that's like... His mother. No, no, no. What's your mother like? I don't talk to her. I've got three mothers, three fathers so I don't know where the fuck any of them are. I really don't care. I didn't see Kevin for a lot of years. I know he was in Chicago. I know he was sleeping on the street. But I couldn't go look for Kevin. I just didn't have the means or the money. I mean, you can't hold your children captive. I wonder if it would've helped, if I'd done something like that. And I'll always wonder. And that's a terrible feeling. I haven't eaten in a week. Just go down to the mission and eat a burrito. I ate today for, like, the first time since I got to town. We're gonna get to see something done. Fuck it, if I don't shit, you'll see something anyway.

He used to write me hate letters. My neighbor across the way was a drug psychiatrist. I used to bring the letters over to him, and he said, "This is not really Kevin, he's under the influence now," because you can see the way the letters were formed.

The so-called reality rocker, who did indeed defecate on stage... Disorderly conduct or was he simply exercising his first amendment rights? Defense argued Allin was exercising his right of free expression. This trial hinges on a constitutional question how far can a performer stretch his right of free expression? No, we have rules. We have certain levels of decency. We the jury, find the defendant, Kevin Michael Allin, guilty of disorderly conduct as charged in the complaint.

I wanna do what I wanna do, I wanna end my life, I'm gonna fucking end it. I'm on my way over to see my mom who I haven't seen in a couple of years now. It's more difficult to see her now I live on the West Coast. It's so far away. I know she has some kind of like, you know, heart beat thing, you know, irregularities. I don't really know the full extent of it. I haven't even talked to my mom in over a month. I'm mean, I'm not a very good son, I guess. Well, look who's here! Hi, Bob, nice to see you. - Hi, sweetheart. - Hello. Wow. Good to see you. Love you, too. Tell me what's going on with your health and your heart. Well, see, I have, Merle,... I have this. My new pacemaker. It's a pack. Like, er, triple-A batteries. - Right. - It's about... - You're running on...? - Running on batteries, yeah. How do you like my new shoes? Not too much. - Huh? - (laughs) - They're Birkenstocks! - I figured the were. They're Birkies. They're Birkies. I love them. How do you like my new shoes? Custom-made. After the tour is over, I sell everything. I truly believe you're part Jewish. Well, I... I don't know. (both laugh) Everybody would love to live the life you live, Merle. Most people that do get killed though. A woman kills them. Right, but I figure if I have another ten years of life, that would be great. I'll live it to the fullest. Kinda like GG said, "Go out before you get too old and too boring." Oh, yeah. But that's so stupid, he went too young. But I don't wanna be, you know, older. Don't you think GG would like to be here now? To be alive? I don't think so. He probably would be in pain. His body would be like an older person, than he already would be. With all the abuse that he did to himself, I mean... I couldn't ever imagine him being alive to live old. You haven't been to the cemetery? - Not yet, no. - I hope nobody did anything. Nobody goes there any more, because they know there's nothing there. Most people do. A lot of people don't know. I went through an awful... awful lot. Awful lot. She doesn't wanna get back with you right yet? She doesn't know what she wants. OK. - I have to give her time. - She's hurt. Of course, she is, I understand. There's always that possibility she could find somebody. Wouldn't be the first time I let a good one get away. Oh, my. - Maybe something like this. - Yeah. You know, that's nice too. And then even this one. Yeah. But that's a little too fucking big. Yeah, it is. We played shows on the East Coast. Then we took three days off, to record. To make a new record. There's really a great one we recorded called, "Sucking on Your Pussy on a Friday Night." It's a great song, we'll play it later. Then we went to Dino's, and hung out for a day. God. What kind of a place does Dino got? A little messy. Is it liveable, I mean...? I couldn't live there for five minutes. Well, he's part of the family. Maybe if he can't stay at his place, maybe you could take him in? I'd rather take all my clothes off, and jump off the Lunenburg Bridge. Oh, my. Well, I guess that answered that question. These are good, what are these anyway? ♪ punk rock music on car stereo ♪ ♪ inaudible singing ♪ ♪ Sucking on your pussy on a Friday night ♪ Life is hard, and so am I ♪ "Life is hard and so am I. Sucking on your pussy on a Friday night." It's good. If the lyrics were different it would be good music. That's what makes the song, great lyrics. Did you wanna hear the one where it mentions your name? No! It mentions my name? - It mentions your name. - Come on. "Arleta, don't... Stop fucking with Arleta's son." Listen. ♪ inaudible punk rock lyrics ♪ ♪ Stop fucking with Arleta's son ♪ Hey, Merle, is it my fault that you're such a jerk? You had a bad upbringing? No, actually, er,... I... You did raise us to know right from wrong. We chose to go wrong. Look at how great we turned out. I mean, come on, that's a good mother right there. When you raise two children, to be like me and GG, you did real fine. And live through it. Because not too many mothers can say they raised somebody like that. - (laughs) - So... You know, that's true. That's like a number one mother year award. I don't know how we would have turned out if we had been, you know, stuck in that log cabin or with our father. Er, you know,... He was mentally not 100 percent. When Kevin was born, he made me name him Jesus Christ because he had seen Jesus, and Jesus said that I should name my baby that. And then I went home and told Merle, I said, "This is your little brother Jesus." And he said, "GG." So that's how GG got his name. And then one day I woke up, and said... Well, first of all, Merle's father, dug, like, a ten-foot hole in the cellar. I asked him one day, "What are you digging that hole for?" He said, "I'm gonna bury you, Merle and Kevin down there." Yeah, but something else happened too. - Well... - Right? Yeah. Earlier this year, you wrote and sent out an essay called "The GG Allin Mission." In it, you take credit for, among other things, being Jesus Christ, God and Satan. I was born Jesus Christ and I have fucked the devil. I've had some very intimate conversations with evil. I think that evil is important, and I think it's also important to put fear in peoples' hearts. I told him, I was gonna leave. And that was the weekend that he held the boys and I with a gun. And, er, raped me. The boys were there, but I didn't say much. I didn't want them to know what was going on. So, I didn't put up any... resistance. When he took his truck, and went away I got the boys and hitchhiked to my mother's house. He came and took Kevin back to the log cabin. I was actually worried about the boys being alone with him. For reasons. I was worried to have the boys be alone with him. I had a few things that made me think that they might not be safe alone with him. I talked to the judge about it, the priest and the doctor. Everyone did agree that he couldn't have custody of them. He couldn't even see them alone. I went to the town clerk, I said, "I wanna change my son's name." ""What to do you wanna name him?" "Kevin Michael." And that was it. He was Kevin Michael after that. But he never stopped being GG.

Kevin called and told me he was coming to see me. He said, "I'd like to come home and get better." New York City. So, this is the big fucking show. Three o'clock at the Gas Station? Gas Station, GG and The Murder Junkies - What's the address? - I've got news, it ain't good. GG was fucking ripped up to go. And he was doing coke and he was drinking. He was all fucking geared up. Now when I go, you can all talk about me again. Please do. And the show breaks out into the street. (shouting) Bottles flying everywhere. It's just a mad house. I was like, "I'm getting out of here, I don't need this shit. I'm done." (sirens approach) We do a show, right here on the fucking street corner. I don't give a fuck. - If everybody would back up. - The fucking police, man. (chanting) GG! GG! GG! GG! Didn't realize that he wasn't really gonna be hanging out with the people that he left with. He ended up going with a bunch of other people that probably really weren't looking out for him. All right. - Let's go get high. - Look what I got. We'll leave this crowd, and go buy our drugs. I wanna get fucking high, man. Don't wanna deal with bullshit. I wanna get fucking high. GG's body was, like, tired. Doing same shit to himself, you know, every other night. Get the hell out of here. Drinking, doing all the coke that he was doing that day. I just think that his body was just, like, worn fucking out. Everything just stood still, you know. And I was like, "This can't be happening." I think about him every day. Not a day goes by that I don't think about my brother. But you can't dwell on the misery of not having your brother any more. You'd be a tortured soul, you know? Welcome to The Museum of Death... ...and the resurrection of GG Allin. - Yeah. - Yeah. Over the last 20 years, you know, GG's popularity is finally growing. He's getting bigger and becoming more popular and, er, he's finally getting some of the recognition that he truly deserves. And I think that having him here, you know, will just help the legacy continue. And, er,... I've had GG's possessions since his death. And I've just decided it was time to, er, let go of some of GG's things. So, without further ado... Drumroll. Are you ready for the resurrection of GG Allin? (crowd) Yeah! Whoo! (cheering, applause) You guys can come closer, you know. He's not gonna throw shit at you. (laughter) This is a picture that Kevin made me while he was in jail, for Mother's Day. He made the rose, he did all of it with paper. Two different kinds of paper, you can see that he used. So he really put work into this. This really meant something to him. This was Kevin talking. This was not GG, this was Kevin. "Mother, have a great day. It's been a long time. I think a lot about the time I was living upstairs and lounging around the pool." See, now this is my Kevin, nobody believes this. The man that liked to come and sit by the pool with me. He was my little boy. My father's brother is there. Kevin is there. And I was gonna be there but I can't now because Kevin... I gave Kevin my place. So what I'm gonna have Merle do is I'm gonna be cremated and he's gonna come down and dig a hole and put me on Kevin. On top of Kevin's grave. I wanna be with Kevin. "So much has happened for all of us, but we're still a family. You, me, Nico and Merle and whoever we decide to bring in to it one day. One day... we will all be able to be together again. So, have a great day, you deserve it. Love Kevin." One day we'll be together again. Down the cemetery. That's the only way I can be together with him is to go to the cemetery. I wouldn't take a million dollars for that. Thanks for coming tonight, everybody. We love you. I think everybody's great being here. I don't know if I've missed anybody. I'm Merle and GG's mom, Arleta. (cheering, applause) Thanks for coming and celebrating the 20 years of Kevin's death. We really appreciate it. We love you for it. Thank you! Thank you. (cheering) Now, it's my honor to introduce The Murder Junkies.
