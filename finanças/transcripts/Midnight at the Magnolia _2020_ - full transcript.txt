[instrumental music] [instrumental music] [alarm ringing] [music continues] [alarm beeping] [music continues] [humming] [lip trilling] -Hey. -Hm? Where's Jack? He'll be here. Uh! He'll be here. [instrumental music] [mouthing silently] One, two... [instrumental music] Good morning, Chicagoans, and thank you for tuning in to The Windy City Wake-Up, Chicago's number-one morning radio show. I am the dashing Jack Russo... [mouthing silently] Sorry. ...and across from me is my dazzling partner in crime, Maggie Quinn. Did your voice just crack? What's happening? Are you finally hitting puberty live on the air? Wow, only thirty seconds in and I'm already getting the evil eye. This must be a record. I don't know if you know this, Jack, but today is December 26, the day after Christmas. Oh, believe me, my headache and I are well aware of the date. Let me guess, you serenaded your family until the wee hours of the night with a private concert? Listeners, can you believe he refuses to play for us live on the air? You know I have crippling stage fright, Maggie. So how was your Christmas? It was good. Thank you very much for asking. I opened presents with my dad, sister Amanda and her family. We made an amazing breakfast and made a snowman outside. Wow. Sounds like an after-school special. -I'm jealous. -And how was yours? Did your mom like the new Crockpot I found on sale? Shh! Maggie! My mom's listening, and she thinks I picked it. I hate to break it to you, Jack, but your mom knows that I've been picking out your Christmas gifts for you since we were 15. She even sends me a thank-you card. -What? Are you serious? -Mm-hmm. I feel betrayed. Next year she's getting batteries. [clears throat] Truth is, I'm more excited for tonight than for the actual Christmas Day. I can already taste your sister's freshly-baked goods. As most of our listeners know, every December 26th, Jack's family and my family do our annual post-Christmas dinner at The Magnolia, which both of our fathers own. Yada, yada, yada. The point is, I am ready to feast. -[pig snorting] -[laughing] Are you bringing Serena? Bring Serena? I'm not even bringing a salad. Oh, very nice. What a gentleman. I've only been dating her for three months, I don't wanna scare the poor girl off. Are you bringing Hunter? -I don't wanna rush this one. -See? -You're just as scared as I am. -No, Jack, I'm not scared! I'm just, I'm waiting for the right time. You've been dating for, what, six months? -When is the right time? -Listeners out there... Does anyone have any thoughts on this? I would say that the nine-month mark is a sweet spot. You're stalling. Ooh, looks like we have our first caller. You are live with Maggie and Jack! Jack! [Maggie] What are you doing? I slept too late to pack a lunch. I know. I covered for you, remember? -[clicks tongue] Hm. -Ah, what is that? Look like fruitcake from last week's Christmas party. Jack, no! That's from over a week ago! Yeah, but it's fruitcake. Here. I brought some leftovers from Christmas dinner. Ooh! Amazing! The phones were flashing brighter than a Christmas tree this morning. Who knew that meeting your partner's family would spark up such a heated debate? And here I thought I was the only one trying to avoid it. -Besides you, of course. -[scoffs] I am not avoiding anything. Hunter will meet the whole gang when the time is right. He's gonna get eaten alive. Okay, just because you don't like him doesn't mean everyone else is gonna feel the same way. I like him. It's just... What? He wears a lot of sweater vests. [laughs] Sweater vests, really? That's all you got? It's unsettling. I think he's got a deep dark secret. You are worse than my dad. You find a reason to dislike every guy that I have ever introduced you to. Or they have failed to find a reason to be liked by me. [instrumental music] Great show today, you guys. Thanks, Deb. Christmas cookie? Ooh! Don't mind if I do. -Good numbers? -Great numbers. People are tweeting like crazy about their own meet-the-family stories. Hashtag Windy City Wake-Up is trending. -Right on. -Gets better. Judd Crawford from Satellite Radio just called. -Satellite Radio? -What did they say? That they're interested in taking Windy City Wake-Up... -To a national level! -Are you kidding me? Is this a joke, is this like the time you said Mandy Moore called the station for a date with me? Oh, yeah, that was a good day. Forget that. This is amazing news! You bet it is. They wanna do a cross-over for the next five days to see if you appeal to their audience before any big moves are made. -For real? This is amazing! -Mm-hmm. -I think I'm speechless. -That never happens. No one has chemistry like you guys. It's time for the country to hear what I've always known. Windy City Wake-Up is great radio. -Simple as that. -Thanks, Deb. But no matter what, you are our producer. -You gotta come with us. -No question. Well, then, we better make these next five days count. Good job, you two. Mags, we're going national! Our chance to make a real impact. This is what we've always wanted. Ever since our ridiculous high school show. Lunch Wakeup With Maggie And Jack. [whistling] I think this calls for the best friends forever power shake. -Oh, no, Jack, no. -What? It's the shake. It marks when we officially became best friends. You're too good for the shake? Come on. -Ooh. Phew. -Ooh. Phew. -Focus, passion, personality! -Focus, passion, personality! -Jack and Maggie forever. Yes! -Jack and Maggie forever. Yes! -Bond. -Bond. Hey, am I interrupting anything? Hunter! You're here early. -Oh, is that, is that a problem? -No. Of course not. I like your sweater. Where'd you get it? The mall, yeah, uh, the... They're on sale 'cause Christmas is over. We should go. I'll be back in an hour. Bye. [chuckles] It's never gonna last. So, anyway, we're gonna start doing crossover episodes beginning tomorrow. That's, wow, that's, that's great. -Uh-oh. What's wrong? -No, it's, I was... I was listening to your show this morning, and it felt like you and Jack were making fun of the fact that Serena and I are not invited to dinner tonight. Oh, no, no, no. No. We embellish things for the show. And trust me, I want you to meet the whole Russo-Quinn gang, but in due time. But I am warning you, they're nuts! But why can't I just meet your father and your sister? Wha... What do the Russos have to do with us? Well, you know, our dads are like a package deal. We do everything together. We may not be family by name, but we are a family. So if we end up together, um, you're telling me that we will be spending the holidays with Jack's family every time? This is about Jack, isn't it? Uh, I mean, you guys are always texting, you have all these inside jokes... You-you, you have a secret handshake. I mean, i-it's a bit strange. Hunter, like I told you, Jack and I, we've known each other our entire lives. If something were to happen, it would've happened by now. We're just friends. I promise you. You ever, um, you ever had feelings for him? No. Of course not. Okay. Sweater vest's on point today. You look incredibly charming. You look like Superman. I have a thing for him. [instrumental music] You excited to tell everyone the big news? Oh, yeah, my dad's probably gonna be so proud, he'll break out the 1967 Chateau Baptiste. And outshine my 2019 Rose? He wouldn't dare. -[sighs] -You okay? Something wrong? I don't know, Hunter and I had a weird conversation today. About what? He was bummed he wasn't invited tonight. You, too? Serena was not impressed with our segment. She made me promise to invite her next year. Wow. So we're thinking long-term. That is a first. Ah. Who knows what the future holds? And that is why you're perpetually single. What? I'm a realist. [instrumental music] [sighs] Hm. Hey, hey. H-h-hey, my boy. Mwah. Dad, I just saw you yesterday. Margaret. You look ravishing, as always. -Maggie! -Hi, dad. Thank you. Interesting, uh, show today. What is this nonsense about you two being scared of bringing your partners to meet us? Dad, remember when I brought Bobby Murtho to Thanksgiving? All that interrogating? He nearly choked on his turkey. Probably still needs therapy after that night. Now that was an entertaining Thanksgiving. -Uh-huh. -Bobby was a bonehead. For crying out loud, he was a Red Sox fan! -He was from Boston. -Ah. -Hi, mom. -Hi, honey. Would you put this on the table? Is there any potatoes in this, or is it all just butter? -Did you ask 'em about the show? -Oh, come on, mom. You know you can't take this stuff personally. Well, maybe if you actually did introduce us to one of your girlfriends, you would see that we can behave ourselves. Uh-uh-uh. Speak for yourself, Barb. -Maggie! -Oh, hi. Loved the Crockpot. You really nailed it this year. Oh, I'm so glad that you liked it. Betrayal. Okay? -Oh. -There they are. Traffic was unbelievable. How's my favorite guy today? -Huh? -I'm good, grandpa! On a scale of one to ten, how did Santa do this year? -Eight-and-a-half. -Good enough. Better than last year. Go give your aunt a hug. -Hi. -Hi! Mwah! So did you hear their radio show this morning? No, we missed it. What happened? -Let me ask you something, Matt. -Yeah. What was it like meeting Nancy and me for the first time? Don't remind me. Watching the movie Meet The Parents felt like watching a documentary. [laughing] [imitating Robert De Niro] Are you talkin' to me? Are you talkin' to me? -Ooh. -Okay, listen, everybody. Maggie and I have some exciting news. Oh, let me guess, you've decided to sell your baseball card collection so I can finally clear out the attic. Not a chance, mom. Those cards are an investment. -Wait and see. -[Maggie] It's better, okay? The Windy City will be airing nationally on Satellite Radio starting tomorrow! Wow, our very own Jackson and Margaret are gonna be famous! -You know what this calls for? -Here it comes. -A group hug. -A what? -Come on. Come on. Come on. -Group hug! [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] There. Happy birthday. -A little gravy? -Yeah. Maggie, did you want some cranberry... Mm. This is delicious! You guys have outdone yourselves. -Hear, hear. -Well, thank you. All credit goes to my lovely wife. Uh-huh. Thank you, darling. I miss Grandma Nancy's stuffing. -Hm. Me, too, buddy. -Hm. Her stuffing was always the best. She left big shoes to fill, but her spirit's always with us. Yeah. So how are tickets selling for the annual New Year's Eve party? [clears throat] What are those looks for? Oh, come on, let's not talk business during dinner, huh? You serious? You love talking shop. It's fine. People are still in Christmas-mode. We'll sell more in the next few days. -Yeah. -They used to sell out in a day. No, unfortunately, times are changing. -Well, should we be worried? -Not at all. Now, please, let's enjoy this delicious dinner. Shall we? Will you pass the potatoes, please, if there are any left? Trade you for the turkey? Or you can pass your plate around. It's about 40 pounds, I don't wanna break my back. Do you mind? Thank you. [instrumental music] -Bye, dad. Mwah. -Love you so much. Well, thank you all so much for the new material for our show. And, Amanda, thank you so much for the desserts. -They were amazing. -Thanks, sis. -Mom's famous recipe. -I helped. [gasps] That must be why it's so good. -Bye, guys. -Bye. -See you later. -Bye, safe journeys. Dad, what's going on with the bar? Ah. Well, what can I say, kid? Seems like no one comes out to listen to live jazz anymore. This place has been a Chicago staple since the '30s. Don't people know that? I mean... Every famous jazz musician who ever lived has played here. I, I know it, son. But, well, it may just be the end of an era. [instrumental music] Sam from Cincinnati, you're on the air. And what can we help you with today? [Sam on phone] Well, I just met my girlfriend's parents over Christmas. Ever since, she's been really distant. I'm worried her parents told her they think she can do better. You see, this is what I've been talking about. Family interfering with a perfectly good thing. How long have you guys been together? About three months. What did I tell ya? Too early. My advice, Sam, is next time you see her parents, ask a lot of questions. People love talking about themselves. -Well, I sure do. -And remember... To treat their daughter like the princess she is, that way, they know you're a gentleman. [Sam on phone] Huh. Okay. That's not a bad idea. Look, Sam, meeting the parents is like beating Bowser's castle in Super Mario. Complete that level, and the rest is smooth sailing. -Know what I mean? -[Sam] Totally. Thanks. You're welcome, bud. Good luck. Seriously? That's your advice? Not everything has to be complicated. Okay, time for a quick commercial break. Don't blow away out there. The Windy City Wake-Up will be right back. -You're a child. -What? It's good advice. [instrumental music] Today was great. So many new callers from all over the place. I think it was one of our best shows yet. Hopefully, Judd Crawford agrees. Speak of the devil. Any word from the higher-ups? Did they like us? I don't know how to tell you guys this, but... Oh, no. They hated us. No. I'm just being silly. [giggles] They loved it! Not cool, Deb. In fact, they loved it so much that they want you two to host a New Year's Eve segment, live, on the air, you'll introduce Serena and Hunter to both your families. Uh, they want us to introduce them to our families? -On the air? -On New Year's Eve. Yeah. Isn't that stepping a bit into their privacy? I just don't think Hunter would agree to do it. Jokes aside, I think it's a little early for me to take that step with Serena. Come on, this is national exposure we're talking about here, you could reach millions of people if this deal goes through. Unless you'd rather stay local forever. She's right. This could be our only chance to go big. Well, where do they want us to do it? They're looking for a venue that isn't already sold out for New Year's. Hold on. This is perfect. How about we do it at The Magnolia? -The Magnolia? -Yes! It'll help boost sales for the club. It would mean a lot of free advertising. -It's a win-win. -So is that a yes? -Let's do it. -What she said. Perfect, get confirmation from Hunter and Serena by the end of the day. This is gonna be the best New Year's ever! It's all happening, nothing can get in the way of our dreams now! Oh. Okay. Ow. Put me down. [Maggie] Jack. Oh... [instrumental music] -Maggie? Jack? -What are you two doing here? We need to ask you something. -Sure. Anything. -Uh, within reason. So, what do you think? The Magnolia will be broadcast across the whole country. What do we think? Come on! Of course we agree! This is wonderful! The whole country? Wow, our prayers have been answered. Great! We'll call Deb and tell her you guys are in. Uh, w-w-we gotta take down these Christmas decorations and start dolling this place up for New Year's! Amen. Let's go find that New Year's box right now. Okay. Dad. This is gonna be just like the old days! We should book a headliner. [sighs] I love seeing them so excited. Me, too. -This is gonna be great. -Yeah. Now all we have to do is get Serena and Hunter to sign on. We're having dinner at my place tonight. I'll call you after. Perfect. [piano music] He's pretty good. My mom loved this song. -[answering machine beeps] -[Maggie] Hunter. Um, I've been trying to call you all day. Um, I'm just getting a bit worried. Anyways, I have exciting news, so call me back. [cell phone ringing] Oh. Hunter? Where have you been? Are you okay? [instrumental music] Wait, what? You're not being serious? Let's just talk about this. [knocking on door] Oh. Hold on. Someone's at the door. I know, Hunter, but let's just talk about this. We need to... -Jack, what are you doing here? -[Jack] We need to talk. No, I don't know why he's here. He just showed up. Hunter, you're not being rational. Let's just talk about this. [Maggie] So that's it? You've made up your mind, just like that? [line disconnects] Are you okay? I just got dumped. Well, if that isn't just the cherry on top. The cherry on top of what? Serena just broke up with me, too. This is so bad. [groaning] [sobbing] -Yeah. -Oh, Jack. Yep. What kind of person breaks up with you over the phone? Everyone knows the two-week cut-off is for a text break-up and one month for a call break-up. I mean, come on. Man up, Hunter. Forget about that, what are we gonna do about the New Year's Eve show? We need a plan. Is that seriously what you're thinking about right now? Yes! This is our big break. No. You know what? This is a disaster. -I need to call Deb A-S-A-P. -Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We can't call Deb! Well, how are we supposed to do the meet-the-parents segment if we have no dates to introduce them to? We will hire people, actors, to pretend to be Hunter and Serena. -Mm-mm. That's a terrible idea. -Why? Hunter's face is all over my social media. Right. [sighs] I can't believe I'm single. Again. [instrumental music] [Jack] How else can we make the New Year's Eve segment a home run? Are you not even sad about Serena? Of course, but if it wasn't meant to be, it wasn't meant to be. You know, for two people that make a living giving relationship advice, we're sure not very good at relationships. [Jack laughs] What could possibly be funny right now? A fan just tweeted she thinks you and I should be together, and it got, like, 2,000 likes. Yeah, I know, they've wanted us to be together ever since we started. -That's it. -What's it? [imitates explosion] What if, on New Year's Eve, you and I surprise the fans by telling them that we are together? W-what? Jack, no! Think, think, think about it. The fans will go wild. It'd be front-page news. We'd get crazy ratings and the execs would see how many people care about our show. -It's a no-brainer. -This is insane. You mean genius? You're actually serious about this, aren't you? Satellite Radio, Maggie. Okay, but what happens when they find out it's a lie? They never need to know. After we go national, we'll let it slip that we casually decided to remain friends. No, Jack, this is a bad idea. Maggie, with a national show, we'd be able to help millions of people across the country. Which is what we've always wanted. Think of the book deals we'll get offered. Okay, now you're getting ahead of yourself. And The Magnolia needs it. There's no getting around that. I dunno about you, but I'm not ready to accept the end of an era. This is crazy. Mags, you're my best friend. I wouldn't wanna do this with anyone else. Say yes. Say yes. Say yes. Come on. Say it, Maggie. Let me hear it. Say it. -Yes. -Yes! Yes! Yes! [instrumental music] [Maggie] Are you sure she's gonna buy it? She's known us a really long time. I know, I mean, you usually go for the quirky bookworm and I usually date... Sexy and cool? That's not what I was gonna say. I can be sexy and cool, you know? [chuckles] -Oh, you find that funny? -No. It's just that I've known you for so long that it's hard to see you that way. Well, you better start or else we're never gonna convince her. Ooh, maybe we should be kissing when she comes in. Just get caught in the act? Kissing? -Like, on the mouth? -Yes, on the mouth! Look. We need her to really believe we are a couple or else she's never gonna let us go through with the New Year's Eve party. Okay, but I need to know what I'm working with. Let me smell your breath. -Are you serious? -Yeah. Ha. Well? When was the last time you brushed your teeth? This morning, like a regular person. Just a peck. No theatrics. Of course, just a peck! I'm not insane! Well, this whole thing is insane, and it's your big idea. She's coming. [clears throat] You ready? Are you sure about this? Of course not. Okay, go. ...here. A-a-ah! Jack! -[Barb] Maggie! -Mom, dad! -What are you guys doing here? -What's going on? Oh, we came to meet Deb to work out the party details... [Martin] Am I losing my marbles or were you two just... Kissing! Wait, yes! Yes, they were kissing! Kissing? What are you talking about? What about, what about Serena and Hunter? Oh, uh, it's a long story. -We broke up with them. -What? Can someone please tell me what's going on? Oh, well, they're in love! Always knew this day would come. Is this true? We've been denying our feelings for so long, we just couldn't push them away any longer. Mm. -Yes! -Ha-ha. -My boy! -This is amazing! Incredible! Our listeners are gonna lose their minds! Oh, no, that's the thing, we have to keep it a secret until the New Year's Eve party. -No one else can know! Shh! -Mm. Of course. Mm. The fans are in for a big surprise. You know, I always thought you two had a thing for each other. This is wonderful! This is absolutely wonderful! We're gonna have to tell your dad, Maggie. No, no, no. We don't have to tell Steve. -Uh-huh. -Don't really have to tell him. Oh, nonsense. We can't keep this from him. Meet us at The Magnolia after work so we could be your backup. Mm-hmm, a-and I'll pack my Taser, you know, just in case things get out of hand. Ooh. I simply could not be happier! Boy, you have made our year. -Oh, and mine, too! -Mm-hmm. -Bye now. -Bye. Take care. -Buh-bye. -Bye. -So cute. Bye. -[Jack] Buh-bye. What? Did you see all their faces? I mean, I've never seen them so excited. Wait, wait, wait, what happens when they find out that we've been lying to them? Well, they don't need to find out. After New Year's, we reveal we decided not to risk our friendship. Uh, I don't know, Jack. This seems like a really, really bad idea. It's fine! We used to prank our families all the time. What's the difference? Remember that April Fool's Day when we covered all the bathroom toilets at The Magnolia with plastic wrap? -Your dad turned into the Hulk. -Exactly. He's gonna kill me, isn't he? Dad, are you okay? Dad... Steve, don't be hasty. [grunts] It's time to crack open the 1967 Chateau Baptiste! Let's celebrate! -Ah. -Yay! -Oh. -Oh, it's a Jack sandwich. Yeah. Okay, dad. Okay, okay. Yeah. [instrumental music] So you just realized, at exactly the same time, you had feelings for one another? Yeah. Pretty much. -Oh, it's fate. -So who made the first move? -Jack. -Maggie. Well, w-who was it? -Me. -Me. [chuckling] The truth is, it was both of us. One night we were working late at the studio and decided to order a pizza, and the next thing you know we are making out like two ravenous animals. Okay, relax. They get the point. Okay. Let's get you to pop this. Oh, no, no, no, dad, don't waste that on us. -It's not like we got engaged. -Yeah. I don't really feel comfortable opening it. It's far too expensive. Well, we, we have all been waiting many years for this day. Unless your intentions with my daughter aren't pure. No, no. They are, they are definitely pure. -Then pop it open, son! -Yeah, okay. -Yes. -Mm... [cheering] -It's open. -It's open. [Jack] Great. [Maggie] My dad had been saving that wine for five decades! If he finds out that we wasted it on a lie, we are both dead. He can never know. I'll marry you if I have to. Oh, how romantic. Did you have any clue that everyone wanted us to be together so badly? No, none, although I did hear my mom say something to my dad back in the day, but... [scoffs] That was dumb. What did she say? Remember when I signed up for the school talent show to play that stupid song I wrote? Mm-hmm. But it wasn't stupid. And remember how even more stupid, I decided to practice in front of you all at The Magnolia? Mm-hmm. My dad filmed it. Yeah, that fact haunts me to this day. Anyway, that night I heard my mom say to my dad that the way you were looking at me was the same way your mom looked at your dad when he played back in the day. Oh. Like I said, always trying to make something out of nothing. Well, I did always love hearing you play, mostly for your off-beat lyrics, so she was right about that part. That was a long time ago. I really wish that you'd kept playing, Jack. No way. After running off-stage in the middle of the talent show? Did you know how embarrassing that was? I'll stick to karaoke with friends. Well, that's a shame, because I think that you were really good. Well, anyway, I better go. We have an early morning again. [Maggie giggles] Goodnight, Jack. [laughs] [sighs] [Maggie] And don't forget, tickets go on sale today at noon for our New Year's Eve meet-the-parents party at The Magnolia. Come hang out with Maggie and me as we introduce our significant others on-air to our crazy families. Who knows how it'll go! Party starts at 8:00 with music, food, drinks and fun to follow. Live from Chicago, The Windy City Wake-Up With Jack And Maggie is signing off. So remember. -Don't blow away out there. -Don't blow away out there. [knocking on door] Hey, hey, hey. I've got great news. Judd Crawford called and invited you two to a cocktail reception. -Tomorrow night. -Wait-wait. We... We're gonna meet Judd Crawford? He's a radio icon! [Deb] He's happy with the numbers on his end and he wants to meet you. I think my heart just skipped a beat. [laughs] Plus, I told him your little secret and he's absolutely thrilled, so... You told him? It was supposed to be a surprise. Oh, trust me, someone like Judd Crawford doesn't want any surprises, he's more than happy with the news, and he thinks it's gonna have everybody buzzing. The Judd Crawford thinks we're gonna have everybody buzzing? This is a really big deal. Also, take a look at the posters for the party. Jeff plastered them all over the city this morning and Judd and his team are pushing it all across their social media. Tickets are gonna sell fast. Um, it says here there's going to be a live video stream of the event on their website? Yes, they decided that they wanted to hear and see you all across the country. Is that a problem? No, of course not. -Sounds good. Anything for Judd. -Exactly. [laughs] -That's good. That's good. -Yeah, it's huge. [instrumental music] I'm still in shock. Judd Crawford. What do you think I should wear? Since when do you care what someone thinks of your outfit? Uh, since Judd Crawford personally invited us to one of his parties. I mean, aren't you excited? He'd be our new boss soon. Maggie? Maggie! Wait, wait, Maggie! We've only been broken up for two days and he's already out with another woman. This coffee shop was our spot! Um, maybe she's just a friend. Am I that easily replaced? No, of course not! Listen to me. You're one a kind, Quinn. I gotta go clear my head. Maggie, wait. Come on. [instrumental music] [knocking on door] -Surprise! -What are you doing here? We're going to your favorite spot. Maple Hill. And I have a thermos full of hot chocolate in my backpack. [groaning] I'm not in the mood. Too bad, I'm not gonna let you mope around the rest of the day just because of lame-o Hunter. -Get your coat. We goin'. -Jack. Come on, this very sled, if it could talk, would recount endless tales of us hurling down the mountain, effortlessly, except for that one day, after my admittedly amazing jump, when I broke my arm and you pulled me, on this same sled, two hours to the hospital. You remember that? Fine. But no jumps. I'm a wild man, and I can't promise anything. However, I'm freezing, so let's go. -No jumps. -Attagirl. Pick it up! -Wait here. -[chuckles] [upbeat music] [music continues] Thank you for today. It was really wonderful. -I needed that. -Ah. I couldn't let my best friend wallow. You know, sometimes I forget how sweet you can be. -Bye, Maggie. -See you tonight. Oh, and Jack? Don't blow away out there. I won't. [keys jingling] Today was so fun. It felt like we were kids again. You're really smitten, aren't you? I can see it all over your face. What? -No, I'm not. -You're not? I mean, yeah. Of course I am. I just want you to be careful. I love Jack just as much as anyone, but I'm not sure I trust him with your feelings. How come? I'm still not over the fact that he ditched you last minute to go to prom with Bianca Bell. You were devastated he just tossed you aside. Remember? Yeah, but that was a long time ago. Look, I, I know you've always loved him. -Always loved him? -Oh, come on, Maggie. Why do you think your other relationships haven't lasted? Dad is so excited for this party. He's really hoping a new generation of customers will revive the bar. Yeah. I can't wait to see the sparkle in his eyes watching a packed house. I wish mom could be here for it. Me, too. Yes! Yes! Yes! [laughs] Dad, what has gotten into you? I just got off the phone with Deb. The network booked The Davin Bros to play here on New Year's Eve! It's gonna be spectacular! -Aren't they expensive? -Uh, it's an investment. Oh. The Magnolia needs an image upgrade, and what better night to book a new act than on New Year's Eve? Dad, that sounds great, but I hope you're keeping an eye on the budget. Should I get a new tux? Dad, are you being serious? Don't go overboard. Just be yourself. -Okay. -[cell phone ringing] Hi, Deb. [laughs] Time to celebrate. Why, what-what's happening? The event has officially sold out in just one hour. This is gonna be the party of the century. [laughs] Oh, my gosh, that is crazy! Have fun at Judd's reception, Maggie. You deserve it. Thanks, Deb. The New Year's Eve party just sold out. -Whoa! -What? What did I tell ya? This is gonna be a fabulous night! You know what, dad? Maybe you should get that tux. That's the spirit! The Magnolia is back in business, I can feel it! -Come here. -Uh-oh! [Amanda] Oh, dad. [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] Excuse me. Are you Jack Russo? -Hi. Yeah. And you are? -Sebastian Weber. I'm Judd's personal assistant. He can't wait to meet you. -Come this way. -Uh, hold on. I'm just waiting for Maggie... Hi. -Maggie Quinn, welcome. -Thank you. -Look who showed up before you. -Well, that's a first. And I didn't even have to call to remind you. All right, all right, we get it, you're the organized one and I'm just the pretty face. Let me introduce you two to Judd. [Sebastian] Mr. Crawford. Jack Russo and Maggie Quinn have arrived. Ah, what a pleasure it is to finally meet my two rising stars. Judd. I mean, Mr. Crawford. Really great to meet you. Uh... You've been my idol for years. A-as a kid, I listened to your first radio show. Get me a refill of that, would you? -Can I grab you two any? -Good for now. So you're ready for the big night? It's gearing up to be a very special show, especially now with the news from our two hosts that there's a romance brewing. Well, it has been a long time coming. You know, your fans are gonna go crazy when they see your big midnight kiss. -Midnight kiss? -Yeah. I can picture it now. The two of you in a passionate embrace just as the clock strikes down into the new year. [laughs] I wouldn't be surprised if it breaks the Internet. Right, right. The-the midnight kiss. Yes! We love kissing. Well, I better get over and mingle with the folks from 101.6. Be sure to get yourselves a drink. Ah... Um, white on ice? -You know me so well. -Be right back. [indistinct chatter] -[Maggie] Oh, really? -[indistinct chatter] That's great. Yeah. -Hey, hey. -Oh, hey. Hey, uh, Jack, did you know that Sebastian is a singer-songwriter, too? I was just telling him all about your old high school band. Listen, Sebastian, Judd is looking for you. -It seemed pretty urgent. -Really? I just saw him. Guess you better go find out. Ooh, thank you. Cheers. -[glasses clinking] -[instrumental music] Ah... Wait. Is this... The song your dad used to play for us before the bar would open. Oh. Remember how we used to dance to it when we were kids, acting like we were adults? Remind me. -Right here? -Yeah. ♪ All my life I've waited ♪ -Jack. -[clears throat] [clears throat] ♪ You are the one ♪ I don't wanna tip people off to our charade. Mm-hmm. ♪ Here you are ♪ ♪ The one ♪ ♪ For me ♪ Oh, thank you so much for this evening. -It was really lovely. -My pleasure. A real honor, Mr. Crawford. -Please, call me Judd. -Judd. I predict a great partnership ahead if everything goes well on New Year's Eve. See you soon. -See you soon. -Bye. You hear that? Judd Crawford predicts a partnership with us! Everything feels like it's finally coming together. -Doesn't it? -Yeah, it really does. I'm hungry. Do you wanna go to The Magnolia for a snack? I'll make home-made Hawaiian pizza. My favorite. Request Uber now. Requesting. Mm. Can you believe New Year's Eve is the day after tomorrow? I know. The place looks so good. My mom would be really impressed. Five years tomorrow, right? Yeah. Family dinners aren't the same without her. She's the only one who laughed at my terrible jokes. She always had a soft spot for you. -So your place or mine? -What? For your annual in memoriam tradition to honor your mom. Definitely mine. [chuckles] Your place is terrible for snacks. True. Okay then. Seven o'clock, tomorrow night, your place for It's A Wonderful Life. I can't wait. -Yeah? -Oh, yeah. Good. So are you feeling any better about Hunter? To be honest, I haven't really thought about him since we went sledding. Mission accomplished! What about you? Serena? Nothing ever seems to bother you. I-I don't get it. Honestly, I knew it wasn't gonna last. If you're not in love, it's easy to get over it. Your heart's not broken. Have you ever had your heart broken? Like, truly broken? When Bianca Bell broke up with me that summer before college, I was pretty devastated. Remember that? Yeah. You stayed in bed for two weeks. I practically had to force-feed you. [both laughing] We've been through a lot together, haven't we? Yeah. Almost everything. How about you? You ever had your heart truly broken? Once. Who? Not Hunter. Was it Bobby? Bobby? It doesn't matter. It's in the past. Whoever they are, they're stupid for letting you go. Cheers. -To... -A wonderful life. Oh, a wonderful life it is, indeed. [Jack] What are you laughing about? -Well... -What? Tell me. Okay, uh, I've actually never had a midnight kiss on New Year's before. What? Really? Never? I'm gonna be your first? -The pressure! -I know. No kidding. And in front of so many people? I'm terrified. -Well, maybe we should... -What? Never mind. It's a dumb idea. No, say it. Maybe we should practice so it doesn't seem forced. Oh. Ah, like I said, it's a dumb idea. Well, you... I don't know. We don't want it to look, um, awkward. Exactly. -[car honks] -[Jack laughs] So sorry. Oh, no. That was incredibly graceful. Maybe we should just wait for New Year's and let the magic happen. -Jack, stop. Ew! -I'll walk you home. This place is gonna look amazing. Hey, where's Jack? It's almost 4:30. Oh, he lives on his own schedule. He'll be here, he always shows up when he's needed. Why do you keep on asking about Jack? -I need his help with something. -Well... Is there something I can help you with? -[Jack] Hey... -Speak of the devil! Jack, Steve needs your help with something. -Sure, no problem. With what? -Follow me. I need you to get the box of extra champagne flutes from my car. Okay? I could have helped him with that. -[gasps] -Ta-da! -Let there be light, he said. -Aha! -Well done. -Thank you. -This it? -That's it. -Okay. -Hold on. Yeah? I need to talk to you about something. Look, my dad told me. I know this New Year's Eve party needs to be a success or by this time next year The Magnolia's gonna be a new high-rise. But listen, I'm not gonna let that happen. No, no, no, no. Don't, don't worry about that. What's up? Is everything all right? Jack, I know you and Maggie have only been going steady for a-a short while... but it means a great deal for the family to see you two together after all these years. Nancy always thought you two were meant to be. -She would be so happy. -Steve, wait. I think I need to tell you something-- Hold on. Just let me get through this. I know this is premature, but I want you to know that when the time comes... you have my full blessing. Is this... It was Nancy's. She'd want you to have it. -I can't take this. -Yes, you can. What if we don't end up together? Come on. I see the way you two look at one another. It's real. You'd both be fools to ever let that go. You're a good man, Jack. There is no one else I'd rather see my daughter with. Don't forget that box. [instrumental music] [door shuts] Jack, can you grab that ladder and help me hang some of these decorations? Actually, I-I'm not feeling very well. I think I'm gonna skip out. -But you just got here. -Yeah, yeah, I know. I think I just need to lie down a little while. Okay. See you at... 7:00. [instrumental music] Oh, I'm so sorry... -Jack? -Bianca? Jack! Hey! Hi. What are you doing here? I thought you lived in San Francisco. Uh, no, no, not anymore. I actually got transferred this summer. I listen to your show all the time. You're quite the local celebrity. What? You listen? -That's flattering. -Yeah, you're hilarious. It kinda reminds me why I had a crush on you in high school. [chuckles] Right. Uh, so are you really gonna introduce your girlfriend to your family live tomorrow night? Oh, actually, we broke up. We're gonna surprise the fans with something else. You're kidding. Well, in that case, do you wanna grab a drink? -Catch up? -Oh, um, I don't know. Come on! Our favorite place is right around the corner. Okay, sure. Yeah. -Just for a bit. -Okay, great. Okay. -Great. -Let's go. [instrumental music] [laughs] Do you remember that time when you saw... [laughs] How could I forget? Just running through the halls in my underwear. Oh, and to think that I asked you to prom after that. -What were you thinking? -I wasn't, clearly. I always felt kinda bad about that. -About what? -Well... Asking you to prom even though I knew you had a pact with Maggie to go with her. -I forgot about that. -Yeah. I kinda heard her crying in the girls' washroom after you asked her if it was okay if you went with me instead. Maggie? She was upset? Of course she was! Are you that daft? -She was in love with you. -We were just friends. She said it was totally fine that I went with you. You are so naive. Have you not figured out why I broke up with you? It's because I could tell you loved her, too. What are you talking about? Come on, you know that song you were supposed to play at the school talent show? It was about her. No, it wasn't. Um, yes, it was obviously about her. I found the lyrics on your desk. How is Maggie, uh, by the way? I heard that her mom died a few years ago. -Oh, no. -Wait, what-what's wrong? -What time is it? -It's a quarter to eight. Why? I'm so, so sorry. I have to go. I completely forgot about something. I'm such an idiot. -Bye. -Um... Maggie! Please! [Jack] Please! Maggie! [sighs] Maggie, I'm so, so sorry. I-I wasn't thinking straight today and I totally lost track of time. Jack, it's late. I need to go to sleep. Just go home. Please. Maggie! Maggie, I'm sorry! I'm-I'm so sorry, but I'm ready now. Let's, uh, let's order food and watch It's A Wonderful Life. We have a show to do in the morning before our big party. Or did you forget about that as well? -How can I make this up to you? -You should just leave. Can we talk about this? Please? What were you doing tonight that made you forget about our plans? Oh. Uh... It's, uh, it's kind of a funny story, actually. I ended up bumping into Bianca. Bianca Bell, from high school? Yeah, and we grabbed a bite to catch up and then-- Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. What? What are you talking about? I think you should go, Jack. Is this about prom? Maggie, I didn't know... I would never do something like that to you again. -You just did! -[Jack] This is different. No, Jack, it's not. Jack, you have been doing this to me our whole lives. Putting me second, taking advantage of the fact that you know that I will do anything for you at the drop of a hat. That's not true. You're my best friend. I would, I would do anything for you. Until something more cool and sexy comes along? That's not fair. Let's just get tomorrow over with. I was so dumb to think that these past few days meant anything. They have, Maggie. They've meant a lot to me. -But? -But... We can't let whatever's happening between us jeopardize the show. Wow. That's really the only thing that you care about. -It's unbelievable. -Come on, Maggie. Be reasonable. I'm not good at relationships, you know that. I don't ever wanna risk losing you. Sometimes risking everything... is the only thing worth doing. Maybe someday, Jack, you'll realize that. What are you saying? Please, Jack, can you just go? Maggie... [instrumental music] [door shuts] Hi, dad, it's me. Can you talk? [Maggie chuckles] Dad, the club looks so good. You've done such an incredible job. -It was a family affair. -Hm. Cheers. But that's not why you're here. What's on your mind, kiddo? How did you know that mom was the one? Oh, gosh. Well, it's hard to say exactly how I knew, but, uh... I think it came down to this one day where I was cleaning your grandpa's attic, and your mom didn't wanna go anywhere near it because she was so deathly afraid of spiders. Yeah, I know, she always screamed when she saw them. But on this one particular day, she heard me fall and break through the old wooden floor up there, and she ran faster than the speed of light into the attic. She ran through tons of cobwebs. They were all in her hair! She faced her biggest fear for you. Something about her doing that made me realize how much she loved me. I really miss her. I know. Me, too. She would be so proud of the woman you have become. -I don't know about that. -Are you kidding? You're so full of integrity and kindness. A parent couldn't ask for anything more. Dad... I think I gotta tell you somethin'. Hm? -Is it about Jack? -Yeah. You really love him, don't you? Yeah. I think I do. So, what's the problem? I just don't think that... he would run through cobwebs for me. Jack has a good heart, but he's never been very good with expressing his feelings. Why do you think he's had so many short-term girlfriends? Why? 'Cause he's afraid of getting hurt. So, wait, I'm just supposed to wait around until he decides to grow up and show his real feelings? Well, that part is up to you. But you deserve someone who will shout from the rooftops how much they love you. Mm! Thanks, dad. Don't you settle for anything less. -I won't. -Mm. Where is she? I can't get ahold of her! I don't know. She's never late. I hope she's okay. -Well, did you do something? -What? No. -Why would you say that? -Because you're you. [footsteps approaching] -There you are. -Oh, thank God. You're on in one minute. Maggie, you all right? We're almost on. Put your headphones on. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for tuning in to The Windy City Wake-Up! I am Jack Russo. And I am Maggie Quinn. Today is a very exciting day for us. Our big New Year's Eve bash is tonight at The Magnolia, and do we ever have a surprise for all of you. The show is sold out, but you can catch the live stream on our website, so you don't have to miss a thing. How are you feeling about tonight, Maggie? I'm nervous, truthfully. Just want the whole thing to be over with. Introducing someone new to our families is a big deal. Frankly, I'm terrified. But it should still be fun. If you say so. Right. I think we should get to our first caller. Sounds great. You are live with Jack and Maggie. What can we help you with today? [man on radio] I have to say, I don't know what you guys are so afraid of. The moment I met my wife, I introduced her to my family within a month. I couldn't wait to start my life with her. Really? So fast? Wow. How did you know your wife was the one? [man on radio] The thought of losing her was way scarier than committing to her. What was that about? You hardly said anything the entire show. I'm gonna get a coffee. Do you want anything? -So this is how it's gonna be? -I'll take that as a no. Please. Can we just talk? I'll see you tonight... if you remember to show up. Thank you so much. -Oh, Mag, Maggie? -Hunter. -Hi. -Hi. -How are you? -Uh, I'm fine. -[laughing] And you? -Good, good. I've been listening to your show a lot. Um, sounds like you're, uh, gonna be going through with that whole meet-the-parents thing even though we're not together anymore. Did you, uh, start seeing someone else? -I could ask you the same thing. -What? Oh, well, I-I just saw you here the other day with someone. Oh, she, she had her hand on yours. [sighs] You mean my sister Madison? -Your sister? -Yeah. I mean, you'd know that if you hadn't been too scared to meet my family. I just assumed... Whoops. [laughs] So who are you introducing your family to? Um, we're actually surprising our fans with something different. -Yeah? -Yeah, it's kind of crazy. Actually. Yeah, well, um... Would you, um, maybe wanna have our coffees together? Uh, yeah. -Yeah. -Great. Backstage tour of the Goodman Theatre? Oh, Hunter, your students are gonna love you. I know, right? That's, yeah... Anyways, um, how about yourself? This, uh, this event tonight, it seems like it's the talk of the town. Look, um, Hunter, I'm really sorry about everything. You deserve more, more than someone trying to push away their feelings for someone else. Yeah. You finally admit it, huh? Yeah, I thought if I met someone like you, those feelings would just go away. [sighs] If only life were that easy. Yeah. Well, cheers to that. -Right? -Yeah. -To friends. -To friends. -And coffee. -Okay. Hey, dad. Jack? What are you doing here? Figured I'd stop by, s-see how everything's shaping up. Shouldn't you two be getting ready? [sighs] We, uh, got in a fight. I think I might lose her. It's impossible, kid. -You're everything to her. -I know. I've been taking it for granted this whole time. Well, then you need to do something to show her how much she means to you. Where do I even start? Look, you know her better than anyone. There has to be something. What would make her happy? I think I know what I need to do. Attaboy, son. Thanks, dad. [beeping] Thank you. Next one, please. -Thank you. -[beeping] Shouldn't they be at their own party by now? Uh, well, they're on their way. They just want to build up the anticipation! -Hi, beautiful. -Hello, Jack. -Hey, Jack. -Hi. Thank God. There's Jack now. Hey, Jack. Looking very dapper tonight. So you excited for the big reveal? Yeah. I'm a little nervous, but I think I'm finally ready. Have you seen Maggie yet? Uh, not yet, but she'll be here. In fact, you know, I think I'm gonna go look for her right now. So, Jack, I heard the show today. Sorry about that one, Judd. Maggie wasn't really feeling well. -I thought you sounded great. -Really? In fact, I wanted to discuss something with you. I spoke to my executives, we think you guys are just so great that you would do just as well with your own shows. Does Maggie know about this? I floated the idea by her earlier on the phone and she seemed very interested. -Oh. -Oh, there she is. -Hi. -You look ravishing, Maggie. Oh, thank you. [Judd] I am gonna go get the camera crew and we're gonna get this celebration started. [clears throat] -Hi. -Hi. You look really beautiful. Thanks. So, l-listen, J-Judd was saying you were interested in his offer to have your own radio show. Is that true? It might be time we did something apart. You really feel like that? Wow. First Hunter, now this. -What? -I saw you two today. [sighs] What does it matter to you, Jack? Really? You brought her? I gave her my extra ticket. Did you bring her a corsage, too? -Hm, Maggie. -Hi. -And it's been so long! -Oh. Oh. -You look really great. -Thank you. I've been doing Pilates. You should join me sometime. [laughing] Yeah. Um, I will think about that. Excuse me, I'm gonna go grab myself a drink. Maggie. Don't just stand there. Go after her. What if she's better off without me? Oh, my God. Who is that cutie that just walked in? [Jack] That's Sebastian. Go ahead. -Okay. Babe alert. -Yeah. Honey! You look beautiful! -Like royalty! -Thanks, dads. [sighs] Is that Bianca Bell? -What is she doing here? -[Maggie] Great question. -What's going on? -Maggie, let's go. Break a leg. We are on in ten, okay? -Bianca and I are just friends. -We're not actually together. Jack, you're allowed to do what you want. -But-- -Three. Two, one. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our fabulous New Year's Eve event, live from the iconic Magnolia in Chicago! [cheering] Thank you all so much for joining us here at the club, and for those of you watching online. It's gonna be an exciting night with a very special surprise. To get the party started, we want everyone to pick a dance partner. That includes the live-streamers. Yeah. The fabulous and talented Davin Bros will get the party started and get us moving. -Take it away, boys. -[instrumental music] Okay, great. We're gonna let everybody dance for a bit. Then we got a few contests for the fans. 11:45, we're gonna get you both back on the stage for the big reveal, then at midnight we're gonna have an earth-shaking kiss. Sound good? -Sure. Yeah. -Yeah. I guess. Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on with you guys? -Nothing. -Nothing. Snap out of it. I need bigger and better energy from you if we want this partnership. Yes! I hope you told Bianca about the big reveal, otherwise she's gonna be really confused at midnight. What? I'm not with her, she's here to support us. Man, I, I haven't seen the club this packed in years! [laughing] Yeah. Yeah. It's quite the turnout. Yeah. Oh, I just was talking to one of your biggest fans. And they were going on and on about how refreshing it is that you two never hold back from telling the truth to your listeners. I'm just so proud of the both of you. -We try our best. Yeah. -Yeah. I need to get some air. Great job, you two! And just for playing, we have gift certificates to The Magnolia! -Give 'em a hand. -[cheering] Now it's time for the moment that you have all been waiting for. Right. The big surprise. As you probably picked up by now, Hunter and Serena are not meeting our families tonight. And the reason for that is because... [instrumental music] It's because... What's wrong? [Jack] It's because...? -Jack, I can't do this. -What are you doing? -I need to tell the truth. -Maggie, don't do this. Uh, the truth is... is, um, Hunter and Serena are not a part of our show tonight... [audience groaning] because they broke up with us. So Jack and I decided that to make this night successful, we would pretend to be in a relationship. And I know it would have made for really great ratings, which is fantastic, but that's not the important part. Along the way I started to forget that this was... all just a lie. And the truth is, it wasn't a lie to me. I'm so sorry, everyone. -Cut to commercial. -No. No way! This is good drama. Keep rolling. Maggie's right. It was my plan to trick everybody and pretend that we were together. [crowd gasping] But my plan completely backfired because after a lifelong friendship, I finally realized that Maggie has always been the one for me. She means more to me than any career move. In fact, the legendary Judd Crawford asked me if I'd like to have my own radio show. [clears throat] The answer is no. I never wanna wake up without knowing I get to see my best friend, the love of my life. Maggie, I love you. I'm sorry it took me so long to finally realize it. I was afraid. But you are the smartest, the coolest and sexiest woman I've ever known. I started writing this in high school. Turns out it was meant for Maggie all along. I know, it took me long enough.

Kiss him! Jack, I can't believe that you sang for me... in front of all these people. And turned down a job with Judd Crawford? Are you sure? I've never been so sure about anything in my life. Ten, nine, eight... [crowd] Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Happy New Year! [cheering] I'm so happy... [cheering] Happy New Year, Steve. He, he ran through cobwebs for her. What?

[cheering] Uh, so, uh, I know we just got together, but I was wondering if you'd be ready to meet my family? I thought that you'd never ask. Hey, hey, hey! [indistinct chatter] [instrumental music] Thank you. For what? The best year of my life. Everything feels right, plus I get to hang out with my best friend and my girlfriend every day. Well, thank you to you, too, because I felt the exact same way ever since we met. Happy anniversary. What's that? You are just full of surprises. Well, I gotta keep you on your toes to make sure I'm the one you're kissing at The Magnolia tonight. Oh, my gosh! My mom's ring. I love you, Margaret Nancy Quinn, and there's no one else I wanna sled with for the rest of my life. Will you marry me? Yes! Yes, I will! Yes, I will.
