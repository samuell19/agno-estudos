Good boy, Pippin. Bring it back. Here. Go get it. Good boy, Pippin. Come on. Bring it back. Here. Drop it. Good boy. All right. Ready, Pip? Good boy! Bring it back, Pip! Ready? Come on. Go get it. Here! Come on. Drop it. Mom, where'd you want the board games? Uh, leave them in the family room. Which one's the family room? Ty, figure it out. Hello? Yes, of course, I understand. It's just... Yeah, no, it's no problem. I just hope he feels better soon. That's all. Wait. Wait. What? No. Yeah, it's, uh, it's going. It's just a lot of work. You know. Getting unpacked and settled in. Yeah, no, it's gonna be great. For sure. Okay. See you tomorrow. Ugh. Owen! What are you doing? How'd you even get up there? - Well, I climbed. - All right, get down. Come on. You're supposed to be helping. - Dare me to jump? - Don't be an idiot. What would you give me if I do? Nothing because you'll be dead, dumb ass. - Now, get down. - It's only like 10 feet. Owen, get down right-- No, Owen, get down. You're gonna get hurt. You're gonna get hurt. Stop it, Owen. - Right now? - Get down. - I'm gonna jump. - Owen-- - Yeah! - No! Owen! Owen? That was awesome! - You're an idiot. - You're an idiot. Owen! Owen! Are you okay? Jesus! Do you realize what would happen if you got hurt? - Sorry, Mom. - Do you? I'm sorry. I told you to look out for him. - I was! - I'm sorry. Jesus. Come on. Let's go. God, if you guys are bored, I've got about a thousand boxes for you to unpack. Come on. Let's go, okay? And then you guys can explore. Okay, Superman? - You're a dumb ass. Jesus. You gotta look out for him, okay? - Okay, I know. - What's goin' on, Pip? What do you see? Come on. Come on. That's a good boy. I'll shut the shades, okay? All right, let's get some rest. Off or on? On. Okay. - Open or closed? - Open. - Mom? - Yeah? I'm sorry about jumping into the hay. Good night. Sleep tight. Wake up bright in the morning light. Do what's right with all your might. You okay? Need another blanket or anything? Do you know that this was the room that I slept in whenever I came? Aunt Silas even let me pick out the paint color. How long? How long what? Will we be here. Um... I guess until I figure out something else. At least you got your own room, right? Okay, sleep well. Come on, Pip. You ready for bed? Huh? All right, suit yourself. You can finish unpacking. All right, here you go. Don't forget your bags. - Love you, Mom. - Love you! Have fun. Hey. How are you, honey? - Good. - Yeah? Hey, bud. Are you good? - Yeah. - Yeah? Mm-hm. Yeah, you guys come say hi to Macy. Hi, guys. Ah! How are you doing? - Hi. - Hey. So, you're gonna pick 'em up after dinner, huh? Yes, thanks for covering for me. Yeah, not a problem. So how's the move goin'? What's this? My lawyer, he wanted you to see those before our meeting. So, how's the new place? New? Gosh, it's been on the market since my aunt passed. It's dated to say the least. Still can't believe you let him keep the house after what he did. You know what? It wasn't an option. His parents bought it for us. Sweetie, you know you could've just stayed with me. - I offered. - I know, and thank you, but this is just temporary. You know, I'm gonna find a condo closer to school in the spring. - Smart girl. - Yeah. - Jessica? - Yeah? Um, Helen Osgood's lab results. She's in E-3. Can you take it? - Please. - Sure, Estelle. Okay. Rookie. Good morning, Mrs. Osgood. Dr. Simmons will be in in a minute and I'm just gonna take a blood sample. It's back, isn't it? They don't bring you in for good news. Good news is a phone call. I'm just gonna take a blood sample. - It's-- - Look. If I've only got so much time left, I don't wanna spend another second of it wondering. Please. It's not so good. Oh, God. Oh, God. I can't go through it all again. Not again. - It's true. - Is not! Yeah, Mom's Aunt Silas told me the story. You were just too young, so you don't remember. There was, like, this tribe of flying cannibals who lived out by the lake... You mean like the ones from The Wizard of Oz? No, those were monkeys. These were something else. When they flew into town, they would kidnap people, mostly little kids, and eat them! Roar! - Tyler! - I scared you. That's so stupid. 'Cause if it were true, you'd be the one who'd be scared, not me. Why is Mom so worried about me getting hurt? 'Cause she doesn't wanna lose us. Lose us how? Like die? No, not die. Just forget about it, Owen, okay? We're almost there. How many fish are you gonna catch? More than you obviously. This is it? I guess. This is Aunt Silas' lake? Where's all the water? - So much for fishing. - Yeah. - What's that? - What's what? There. Owen, let's go back, please. Pippin! Pippin, wait! Pippin! Pippin, no! Come back! Pippin! Pippin, get out of there! - Pippin! - Get him, Owen! Come on! Get him out! Get him out! - Tyler, help. - Come on, Pippin. Tyler! Get him out. Help. Tyler, Tyler! I'm stuck. Pull. Let's go. I mean these don't even prove anything. And they're, like-- they're from three years ago. How could this possibly matter now? You need to tell me if you think anything else - is gonna come up. - No, I've told you everything. Okay. I've been clean for 15 months, Jill. Well, why don't you drop them off-- Please tell me this isn't gonna make a difference in my case. They generally favor the mother-- Yes, I know they generally rule in favor of the mother-- Wait. Hold on. I'm gonna have to call you back. Hey! Owen! I told you not to go back there. It wasn't my fault. Pip ran in and I couldn't-- Oh, my God. I can't deal with this right now. Okay, so, off with your clothes, hose down, and don't come in the house until you're clean and dry. I'll get the hose. Hey, it wasn't your fault, Pip. It wasn't your fault. He doesn't like olives in his sauce. Dad usually takes them out. All right. Okay, listen. Both of you. I'm not perfect. Okay, I'm not. And I know that your dad has been there for you a lot more than I have. But I'm here now. And I really want us to be a family, okay, but we have to be a team. Especially now. And I know that this house is not like our old house. But I'm excited about getting to make it a home with you. I'm not gonna let you down again. Uh-uh, not again. I love you both so much. But you love me more, right? Owen! How did you know? - Owen! - Oh, uh-huh. - Owen, she's lying to you. - You heard it there, folks. Hey, buddy. - What is it, Pip? - I mean you, like a lot more. See somethin'? - Mom. - Yeah? I think there's something out there. What is it? I think it's just a raccoon or something, honey. Pippin! - Pippin! - Owen! Pippin, no! Hey, be careful! Owen! - No! - Owen! Pippin! Pippin, here! Hey, Pippin! - Pippin! - Come on, boy! Pip! - Pippin! - Pippin! He'll come back when he's ready. Why didn't you stop him? Honey, he was too fast. - I'm going out there to look. - Absolutely not. Mom, it's Pippin! Yeah, and you can look for Pippin after school tomorrow. It'll be too late. Owen, stop. Inside now. You don't care about Pippin 'cause Dad got him for us. That's why. Our concern is for the children. At their age, they still need bonding time with their father. Which they have every other weekend, but during the school week, stability is the key. I agree. Patrick has been the primary caregiver, providing them with that stability for almost three years, as Mrs. Stokes took care of her private issues. Oh, don't go there! That's totally unnecessary. - He got them ready for school. - Mrs. Stokes went to rehab. He picked them up. He cooked dinner. And she has been perfectly capable of taking care of her children. She's proven that over and over again for the last 12 months. - So, she would be-- - Look, look. What is Owen's favorite bedtime story, Jess? - What is Ty's favorite movie? - Patrick, please, let me-- No, wait. What does she like on her eggs? Gimme a break. Look, I was there for this family when you couldn't take care of them, Jess, let alone yourself, and now you just wanna end that for me? Patrick, please. Four days a month? Four!? No, it's not enough. I deserve more. - More?! - Yeah, more. You want more?! You got the fucking house and the nanny! - You want more. - Oh, don't bring her into this! Oh, bullshit! You brought her into it when you started fucking her. - Really?! - Jessica. No, appa-- apparently, after I was-- I was sleeping away my days on the couch, right? - On the couch. - Yeah. On the bathroom floor, in the car, anywhere you fuckin' wanted, you slept. Okay, you know what? That's enough. You didn't do anything! You didn't have to do a damn thing! Fuck you! - Fuck you! - No, this is enough! Yeah, yeah, that was not helpful. You can't lose your temper, not with your past. You need to prove why the kids belong with you, Jess. - Thanks. - I'll talk to you later. - He's a yellow lab. - No, no. - Nothing? - I'm sorry. Owen? Tyler? Hey. How you doin'? Why don't you, uh, grab your coat? Take a break, you know? We're all gonna go out and look for Pippin, okay? Mom, I tried to stop him. Owen, get in the car. Get in the car! Look at me. Do you have any idea how worried I've been about you, hm? What the Hell are you thinking biking all the way out here and without a helmet, huh?! Because I love him and you don't! All you ever think about is yourself. God damn it! That is not true. Now I know why Dad left you. Get in the fucking car! You let him go. You're lucky you're not grounded. He's back! Guys, he's back! He's back! Guys, Pip's back! Owen. Don't go any closer. What's wrong with him? Owen. Step back to me, Owen. Slowly. No, no! - Mom! - Get him off! - Get him off! - Pippin! Pippin! Pippin, no! Get off! Get off! Mom! Get help! Oh, my God! Oh, my God, oh, my God! Honey, go get help! Call 9-1-1, right now. Mom! It's okay. We found him unresponsive. How's his breathing? Very minimal air entry. Hey, can you grab her? Can you take her? Yes, of course. Come here, sweetie. It's okay. It's okay. On my count. One, two, three. His carotid's been bitten in his left leg. Jessica. Wait, the dog got his brachial... his left leg. Okay, okay, we got it from here. Go get yourself cleaned up, okay? Give me his vitals. We have blood pressure 60 over 30, tachycardic. Right, let's take a look. Okay, give me one unit of emergency blood. Run it wide open. Can we get this cleaned up, please? Let's go. Clean it up. Uh, cross and match for four units. Thank you. Hey. He's gonna be okay. Okay? All right? Okay? There is a great team of doctors looking after him. - There was so much blood, Mom. - I know. I know, honey. That's normal for an animal bite, okay? Where is he? He's sedated right now. I'll move him to a private room later. I don't understand why you would even let him near that dog if he was acting aggressive. That dog? Patrick, it's Pippin! That's the dog you bought for them. All right, when in a million years would you think Pippin would do something like this? I mean, the dog went crazy. It wasn't Pippin. I told you. I told you moving way the Hell out there was a bad idea. Oh, don't you even try to blame me! You were perfectly fine where you were. - No, we weren't! - Now you got them out there - in the middle of nowhere? - No! Like you gave us a chance. You were out there less than a week and a half and this happens. Were you sleeping on the fuckin' couch? Hey, come keep me company over here. It's on you, Jess. This is on you. Baby. Honey! Hey. We're right here, sweetheart. Hey. How are you feelin'? Hungry. Yeah, much better now. Yeah, we're very lucky. - Really? - Okay. - Eat up. - Smells weird. All right, well, just do the best you can. - You're the best. - 'Attaboy. I'm sorry. Um, Mrs. Osgood is back. She specifically requested to see you, but I can handle it if... Um, okay, I guess I can take a little break. He's doing so much better, so... I'm so glad. Mrs. Osgood, nice to see you again. - Helen. - Helen. It looks like Dr. Simmons is gonna go over your treatment plan, but in the meantime, I am going to take your vitals if that's okay with you. How are you feelin' today? Are you married? Uh... No. Was, yeah. But, uh... - No. - Kids? A boy and a girl. That's wonderful. I-I-I don't have any children. When I got the news the other day, "six months to a year," I came home. I stared at the phone. Didn't have anyone to call. Sorry. I've... I've heard about some doctors, nurses, who will help people, at the end, you know? They-- they-- they-- they help them. Instead of the treatment, I mean. Mrs. Osgood-- Helen, that's not exactly what we do here. But, but, you could, right? I mean, no one would need to know. Helen, I know what it's like. To feel hopeless. I... I've been there. And it's hard. What's that expression? "It's always darkest before the dawn." It really is. Look. We have plenty of doctors here that can better discuss this with you. I'd be happy to arrange a consult for you. Code blue, code blue. Room 5-2-0. I'll be right back. Jess, Jess, Jess! We got him. We got him. Give me something to clean him up. 45 milligrams of Ativan IM, stat. We need to clear an airway. I don't know what happened. I went to the bathroom and he just... What's wrong with him? Rolling. Get ready to intubate. Hi, folks. I'm Dr. Forsythe. So, first of all, Owen is doing much better. Okay, his fever is down, and we are gonna keep him intubated until he's more stable. He's getting blood transfusions. Those appear to be working. We're covering all the bases. Is it an infection, Don? We just don't know yet. Dr. Avery was running the labs. Did she tell you that the rabies tests are all coming back negative? - Yeah, yeah. - Good. So at this point, we suspect we're dealing with some type of anemia. How can a dog bite cause that? There are rare viral and bacterial conditions. It's possible that he could've contracted one from your dog. Is he gonna die? - What? No! - Honey, no. No, no. Of course not. Don't worry about that. - O's gonna be fine. - Don't worry. Jesus. What does that machine do? It's helping him breathe, sweetie. Mm, something got inside of him, a virus maybe. His body's working really hard to fight it off. You know, he was so tiny when he was born. Came a month early. All I could do was imagine the worst. I'd never been more scared in my life. But, he was fine. You can fix him though. - Right, Mom? - Yeah. Yeah. He'll pull through again. Yeah. No, nothing's changed. Yeah, well, he's still unconscious. Still? Are you serious? Yeah, his stats are getting worse. I don't know. You heard Avery. All the tests came back negative. Of course I am. Okay, we'll come by around 7:30, okay? - How's Tyler doing? - She's sleeping. I mean, I hope Shelly doesn't say anything either, okay? Why would she do that, Jessica? Where are you now? Are you monitoring him? Yeah, of course, I'm monitoring him. I'll call you back. Owen? What are you-- Owen! What are you doing? What are you doing? Gimme that! What are you... Get in the bed. What are you doing? What's going on? Um, ah, he just woke up. He took his breathing tube out. - He extubated himself? - Yes. His breathing seems better. Okay, let's not re-intubate. How much propofol is he getting? Um, three milligrams an hour. Guess you really wanted out of this bed. Let's see how you're doin', buddy. Squeeze my hands. His vitals are looking better. Hey, buddy. Hey, welcome back. Okay. Ready to eat? I don't want that. Come on. I had them make this especially for you. I don't want it. Well, you gotta eat something, all right? Okay, so, what do you want? Anything at all. I want more. No. - Mom, please. - Honey, stop. You didn't know what you were doing. You were delirious, honey. - Mom, I need it. - Stop. Hey, hey! Wow, look at you. - How you feelin', bud? - Good! Yeah, you look good. You gave us such a scare. All of us, right, Mom? - Mm. - Yeah. Oh, look. I got this for you. - Thank you. - Yeah. It was either that or a pink flamingo. Hey, Jess. I thought you said he was... What happened? - He's rebounding. - Did he eat? - Yep. - Yeah? I'm so proud of you, bud. What'd you have for dinner? Cell count is way up, vitals getting back online. Our best guess is the anemia was caused by a virus and his body was able to wipe it out. That's great news. How long do you think he'll be in here? Oh, we'd like to keep him at least through to the end of the week, make sure the improvements hold. Really is an amazing recovery. He's quite the fighter. Yeah, he is. Like father, like son. Good night. Sleep tight. Wake up bright in the morning light. His blood pressure's dropping. BP 80 over 30. He's tachying, respiration's over a hundred. Sat levels are getting low. Apply O2. He's pale and clammy. Start a saline bolus, 150 CC's. Infuse it over... half an hour. What the hell happened? I don't like these stats. I hope he's not relapsing. Okay, I can take it from here. - Sure, Jess. - Thank you. You're absolutely sure? Yes, Liz, I have training in hospice care. I can monitor him at home just as easy as we can here. Here's your favorite soda. And you said yourself, the dip in his vitals last night was probably the end of it. Look, he needs his own bed, right? His family, his sister. You understand. Okay, take the rest of the week off then. - Let us know how we can help. - Thank you. Mom, pasta's done! Mom! Pasta's done! Did you strain it? - Yeah. - All right, you get started. Go and eat, Ty! You almost done? Hey. That's enough. Come on. Hey, hey. Hey! All right, we gotta save it, okay? Gotta make it last, right? What if we run out? We won't. Okay? It's temporary, all right? It's gonna stop. What if it doesn't? It will. Would I have to go back to the hospital? No, no, no, no, we're not gonna do that. We're not gonna risk that, okay? - But-- - Hey. We can't tell anybody about this, all right? Not your dad, not even Ty, okay? If anybody found out, they'd take you away. Maybe forever. Do you know what that means? All right, look at me. We know what works. Don't we? Okay, I just gotta keep you healthy until I figure out how to beat this, okay? - Mom? - Yeah? Pippin's dead, isn't he? Yeah. I looked through the blood lab results you sent us, Mrs. Stokes. Honestly, it all seems consistent with acute anemia. But is there a way to tell the cause? I'm sorry. Not from what you sent. Eat up, buddy. I'm gonna make some eggs too. Okay, let me ask you, has there ever been a case that only responded to alternative means of transfusions? What's in that? Such as? Oral, for example? I've heard of cases like that, sure. With psych patients... with schizophrenics who think that drinking blood would make them live forever, or members of a demonic cult who have bizarre rituals. Forget it. I just thought I'd ask. You know, Mrs. Stokes, with the kind of emotional trauma your son's been through, it might be good to talk to someone, both of you. I could arrange a consult right here in Des Moines. That won't be necessary, but thank you. - You sure? - Yeah, I'm... I'm sure. I appreciate your help. Thank you, doctor. All right. Owen! Oh, my God! What are you doing? I'm sorry. Oh, my God. This is barely enough for tomorrow. Sorry. - Hey, Jess! - Hey. I thought you took the week off. Uh, yeah, I did. I just, um, I just came back to get some bandages for Owen, but, you know, my card doesn't seem to be working. - Do you mind swiping me in? - Oh, shit. You have to go through Avery now. They think that someone's been stealing plasma, so she put in this new protocol. Pain in the ass. Let me page her for you. Uh, no, don't... don't worry about that. I'll just hit up Walgreens. Oh, hey! How's Owen doing? - Yeah, much better. - Oh, good. - Hi, can I help you? - Uh, yes. I'm... I'm looking for a pet for my son. Sure. Mice make good pets for kids. Do you have anything bigger? Now, I'm gonna show you how to bleed out your deer... Hey. - Hi. - How was your day? It was okay. In the lower neck here, you can feel two bones like a V... Is he sick again? No, he's... he's just tired. Did you have a good day at school? It was okay. What's for dinner? Hm? Dinner? Um, leftovers. Good? You like it? Okay. - Yeah. - We'll get some more. - Yeah. - I'll be right back. Owen? Oh, my god. Honey. - All right, um, F-4. - That's a miss. Yeah! All right, um, H-7. You sunk my boat! - Yes! - All right, your turn. - C-7. - That's a miss. - Okay, you're so cheating. - I'm not cheating. Yes, you are! If I'm cheating, I wouldn't let you win. Well, you're not. I only got one. You're so cheating. Hey, Mom. Do you wanna play winner with us? Uh, no, I'm... I'm gonna go to bed. It's late. Wash up in 30. Hit the hay, okay? It's a school night. Mom, it's like 7:00. Hey! - Really, Patrick? - What? What are you doing here? What are you talking about, Jess? There's a schedule for a reason. Yeah. The kids need some consistency and some routine... - Yeah, it's Saturday, Jess. - ..around here. Jess, it's Saturday. It's my day. You're working today. We talked about this last night. Jesus Christ. What did you do to your arm? - Hey, Dad! - Hey, bud. Hey, look at you. Wow, you look great! Go get your sister, all right? Let's go. - Where are we going? - We're gonna go bowling. Aw, come on. You'll love it. Got get your sister. - Let's go. - Can we go to the movies? - Nope. - Um... - Ty, Dad's here. - What did you-- - I'll be a minute. - Jess. You gonna get a strike this time? Yeah, Dad. I think you're going down. Okay, your bottle's inside. Huh? You understand? Yep. Come here. - Mom. - Mm-hm? - It'll be okay. - Come on! - Let's go, buddy. - It's gonna be fine, okay? Go. We got incoming. Code blue, O-D. 54-year-old female, neighbor found her unresponsive, pills everywhere, benzos, opiates, and booze. Ma'am, can you hear me right now? Ma'am? Can we get a BP, please? Die. Die. What's she saying? Let me die. I wanna die, now. She wants to die. That's pretty clear. Get an amp of Narcan and 30 CC's of Flumazenil. I wanna die. I wanna die. - Katherine. - Hey, Jess. Hey, David. How are you doing today? Which bed is Helen Osgood in? Bed 24. All right, she's all secured. Thank you. How'd it go with Dad today? I almost ran out. Gotta pace yourself. Gotta pace yourself. Mom! Mom! Mom, there's a fire! Mom! - Oh, my God. Oh, baby. Hi, Jessica. Glad to see you back. - How's Owen? - Good, complete recovery. - Oh, that's wonderful. - Mm-hm. I called you yesterday, but I didn't hear back. The labs on the dog's tissue sample came in. They didn't indicate any kind of known viral infection. It's very strange. Hm. Well, he's, uh, fine now. Hm, still, at some point, if you don't mind, I'd like to do another blood analysis. - Sure. - Maybe bring him in next week? - Great. - Moving someone? Uh, yes. You know we have orderlies for that, right? - Hey. - Hi! Was Helen Osgood released? Um, yeah, about 10 minutes ago. I... Nice to see you going home. Oh. Hey, look. I'd be happy to drive you somewhere if you'd like. Oh, no. Thank you. The bus is coming soon. Oh, really, it's no trouble. My car is right over there. No lectures. I just thought you'd like the company. It's always darkest before the dawn. You said that to me, didn't you? Mm-hm. This morning when I woke up, someone had left a bouquet of lovely white carnations by my bed. Probably one of you nurses. Hm, I don't know. But for some reason, it just filled me with such immense... ...joy. I haven't felt that in, well... oof, a long time. Hm. And it made me reflect on what you said. There is a way that you can love your life-- You hear that? Hear what? There's something rattling around in the back. Must be one of the kid's soccer balls. I'm gonna pull over. I'm sorry. I'll just be a second. Wow. It's such a mess. Two kids. Okay, got it. Shh, shh, shh. Shh! Shh. Don't talk, okay? Just listen. Hey. You deserve to know what's going on, all right? And I'm gonna do my best to tell you, okay? Can you be quiet? Okay, okay. Don't say a word. - What is this? - Shh, stop! Don't make this harder than it already is, okay? All right, if you can't keep quiet, I'll have to put the gag back in. Do you understand? Yeah? Okay. My son is... He's very sick. And I don't know what's wrong with him. And I don't know how to make him better. But I know how to keep him alive. But to do that, I need your help. - I... - You don't have kids. You're not a mother. You don't understand that you would do anything. Anything to save your child. What? No. Thank you. No! No. Please. Please, no! I'm sorry. Sorry. Shh. Yes, yes! No, I'm crashing. No, no, turn the corners right here. - I don't have any nitrogen. - Oh, shoot. You've wasted it all. Come on. All right, hold on, hold on. You got Mom playing video games? Yeah, she's so bad. Oh! - Oh, shoot! - Yes! - Care to race again? - You're so bad. You take over. I'm gonna do some cleaning up. Mom, Ms. Nelson asked about Owen today. - Ms. Nelson? - His homeroom teacher. She wanted to know when he's coming back to school. She said she tried calling you. Mm, not quite yet. Mom, that's no fair. I'd have to be dying before you let me stay home. Well, I like him more. - Dinner in 15, okay? - Wanna play? I got you some water. You like pizza? You have to eat. You have to eat. I need to use the bathroom. You're a monster. A monster. A monster! Ah! No, no! God! What's down there? God. Nothing. I was just cleaning. Then why is there a lock on the door? Owen, I don't want him going down there and getting... ..in trouble, so... Hey. What are you doing up? I can't sleep. Are you hungry? Mom? Yeah? I like it when it's warm. It's just a sedative, like I gave you at the hospital. It'll help you relax. Help me. Help me. - Help me. - Who are you? - Needle. - What? Needle pull... out. Needle. I brought you some oatmeal. You need the carbs. How did that gag come off? Tyler? Honey? Tyler? Whatever you think it's... it's not what it looks like. Honey, it's for Owen. Why don't you come out and I'll explain it. - No! No! - Honey! - No! - Honey. Get off of me! Let me go! Let me go! - Shh... Let me explain. - Let me go. Let me explain. Okay? Is it like a disease? I don't know. All I know is it's the only thing that's making him better. Mom, he needs to be at a hospital. No. They will not give him what he needs. Alright? They won't understand. This is an insane treatment, honey. But we can help him, alright? You and me, sweetie. What about that lady? You can't leave her locked up down there! I know, I know, I know. I know. Mom, that's not right. She's dying. She doesn't have any family. So, we're going to help her. And we're gonna make it peaceful for her, okay? And in the meantime, she can save your brother, okay? Okay? Honey, she can save him. She can save him! Baby, she can save him! Please try. I don't wanna die. What's it taste like? Like metal. Like sucking on a penny. You've done that? Yeah. Josh Kirby dared me to do it. - That's gross. - Yeah. Ty? Yeah? What's happening to me? Nothing. It's temporary just like Mom said. I look different. Yeah, but only when you're hungry, right? I feel different. It'll be alright, O. We're gonna figure this out. You're gonna get better. Mom, he's here. Come on, let's try and have some fun with Dad today. Okay? - Hey, look at me. - Hey, Dad... Keep an eye on him, okay? That's your job. Okay? Alright. You want the ball, Macy? What? Oh, you want that. Don't-- don't let him get off. You gotta keep reeling. Keep reeling! Keep reeling! Good job! Bring him here. Hey look! - You got him! - You got him! - Good job, O. - Good job. - Oh, nice job, Owen. - Yeah! - Good job. We've got lunch. - Go grab that bucket, alright? - Okay. Ah, shit! Ow. What did you do? Uh, I just stabbed myself with a hook. - Ow! - It's not so bad. - Yeah, says you. - O, will you run and grab the medical kit from my truck? Owen? Buddy. My truck, the med kit... Yeah. ...can you hurry up and grab that before clumsy bleeds out. Hey! Can't take the city out of this girl, can you Ty? I lowered the sedative for you. You feel better? I'm going to make it really comfortable... ...really do my best. I understand why you're doing this. I never could have kids... ...but I wished for it. To have someone to give that love to. So... I understand. Maybe, um... Maybe you haven't always been the best mom-- Let's get you settled in. No one can accuse you of that now. I see the love. And I feel it. But you don't have to do it like this. I'll help you. I'll stay. Ah! Oh! So, how's your mom seemed to you lately? Good... I guess. You guess. She's been a little absent-minded lately. What do you mean? Well she-- she almost burned down the house the other night. What? Dad, it was no big deal. She just left the pan on the burner. Dad, I just think she's really tired with all the stress over Owen. Well, he seems fine now. Yeah. Jessica Stokes? Uh, yes. Sorry to bother you, your name came up in a missing persons case we're investigating. Uh, oh my God. Just a couple quick questions. Of course. How can I help? Helen Osgood, do you know her? I do. She's a patient at the hospital where I work. Co-worker of yours, Miss... Candice Reese? She said that she say you asking questions about Miss Osgood just after she was released. She's missing? Ma'am, we have security camera footage from the hospital parking lot showing Miss Osgood getting into your car. I did. I gave her a ride as a favor. I uh... How well did you know Miss Osgood? Uh, she had been... Help. Help! Help-- ...thyroid cancer, it was... terminal. Um... The last time she came in, she tried to, um... I'm sure Candice told you. Yes. My God. Do you think that maybe she found somewhere more private to try a second time? Well, we've been having a tough time tracking down any relatives... She said she didn't have any. Right. Well, thank you for your time. Help! Help me! Thank you. Help me! Help! Drink it. It's not warm enough. I don't care. Drink it. - No! - Drink it! How did it go? He's changing, mom. He's not acting normal anymore. Did your dad notice? What? No. But he's getting worse. It's not enough, mom. He needs more. Well, then we'll get him more. All right. - Mom? - What? Go upstairs and make sure she's not inside. Owen? Mom? Mom, she's not upstairs. Did you find her? What? What happened? I'm hungry. Mrs. Stokes? My name is Regina White. I'm from Child Protective Services. What is this about? It's come to our attention that your son, Owen, hasn't been to school since September 15th. We tried calling you a bunch of times, - and couldn't get an answer. - What did you do? What did I do? - Are your kids home? - Uh, yeah, no, um... My daughter is at school and my son is upstairs asleep. He's sick. No, you can't come in-- He's-- He's sick! Really, 'cause every time I see him he looks fine and you look sick. Why are you doing this? Where is Tyler? At school! No. I called this morning. She's not at school. - Of course she is! - I called Dr. Avery. She said you won't return any of her calls and that you told her Owen was much better. He was, but-- Was!? Jess, "was?" Then why isn't he back in the hospital? Honey. At school, huh? Where've you been, Ty? What's going on? Look, you're both going to come with me for a few days, okay? I want you to go upstairs and get some clothes and clean up at home, okay? - Come here. Honey. - Let's go. - Come here. Come here, honey. Mom. No, no, no. No talk. Go. Honey, come here. I'm going to help her. Ma'am, I need you to stay here. No, I want her to. Please. Just down here, Owen. I'm going to talk to your dad for a second, okay? Come here. Come here. Okay. Don't worry, okay? I'll figure it out, alright? Just go with your dad. What about Owen? This is all I have. Mom, that's not enough. I'll get more. Mom, it's not helping him. He's not getting better. He's getting worse. Mrs. Stokes, it's time. Mom? Mom, you need to listen to me. There's something at the lake. What? Out at the lake, that's where I was. I saw it, there's something there. What are you talking about? There's something wrong with that tree, Mom. It got inside Pippin and it changed him, and now it's inside Owen and it's changing him, too! Tie, I don't know what you're talking about, honey. Mom, we have to help him! Honey, we are helping him! We are helping him. Let's go. Hey, listen up, guys. I know this is... sudden and scary. I want you to understand why this is happening now. You know, your mom, she didn't give me a choice, and, don't get me wrong, she's a great person. She loves you. She loves you both more than anything... It hasn't always been so easy for her. You know she's out there, she's... Hi. Come on in. Hey, guys. Hey, Tyler, come here. Thanks for coming. We have to talk to Regina for a little bit. So, why don't you guys go upstairs until we're done, okay? Alright, get cleaned up. We'll have some lunch in a bit. Come on in here. Something to drink? Try to be a little bit quiet, guys, okay? Macy's taking her nap. So, Regina, we just wanted to talk about where to go from... You saw her yourself. She looks awful. I think she's using again. And, you know, I wanna make sure we handle this the right way. I have to do what's best for them. I mean, you saw, you saw... It's a mess. And Owen, he's not himself. I mean, he's losing his spirit. He's-- He's different. He's a sensitive kid. He takes this stuff on... Owen! Don't! What were you doing?! You have to control it, Owen. I can't. I can't, Ty. Let's go. Where are we go? They need to live here and we need your help. Please, what are our next steps? What do we do? What's best is that we assess the situation over the next few days. The most important thing is that the kids are safe. It's just up ahead. Hold tight. Tyler?! Owen! Where are the kids, Jess? What? I came to get the kids. You already fucking took them. They took Shelly's bike. They came here, didn't they? No. What, are you hiding them from me now? No! Tyler! Owen! Wait, they're not here. Yeah, why would I believe you now? You've been lying to me for weeks. Jesus Christ, is swear to God, Patrick, they're not here! Bullshit! Where else would they go, Jess? Where?! Tyler! Owen! Owen! Why don't you just tell me where they are, Je-- Almost there. You know where I'm taking you, right? Gonna burn that tree down. Someone tried to before. It's the only thing that'll fix you, Owen. I'm going to kill whatever's in there. Whatever it is that's doing this to you. Then you'll be better. Owen? Owen. Try to control it. You have to. Please, Owen. We have to fix you. No! No! No! Owen! Owen! Stop it! No! No! Owen, no! Get off of her! Mom! Mom! Honey. Honey. Owen, stop it! Calm down! Mom, it's got Owen! Calm down! Calm down. Mom, that's not Owen! That's not him! Please calm down. That's not... It's not Owen, Mom. That's not my brother! Tyler, turn around. Mom. Do it. What do I do? What do we do? Night. Sleep tight. Wake up bright in the morning light. Do what's right with all your might! Hey. We can never tell anybody about what really happened. No one. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry, Mom. I tried. ...but the things that are unseen... Since the death was ruled an accident, the DA is not pursuing any kind of criminal investigation, Jess, but your ex-husband is moving forward with the negligence claim. They're basing their case on two factors. One, you let the children play unsupervised near a known water hazard, and two, Owen's autopsy. It showed he had an unusual deficiency of calcium and vitamin C and D. They're saying you may suffer from Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy. That's when a parent purposely keeps a child sick-- I know what that is. Can you just tell me when I can see my daughter, please? The judge is giving your ex-husband sole legal custody. But they'll review it in six months. So, Jess, if you can put yourself together, maybe seek counselling, there's a fair chance they'll modify the ruling. Everything's good with your dad? School okay? I know this is hard for you, Ty. And it's my fault, all of it. I am trying to find a way to live with that. That's time. You did the right thing. You okay? Huh? Come here. Good boy. Go get it! Jericho.
