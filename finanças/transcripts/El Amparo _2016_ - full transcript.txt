The same for the street walls... Green, white and orange balloons covered the sky of Caracas as part of the campaign... ...Until December 4, when the next Venezuelan president will be elected. You woke up very energetic today. Get over here. I had my decorations on that table. What better decoration than you, baby? Come over here. Alright, I'll move my stuff. ...One of the best electoral systems in the world, which guarantees the universal, direct and secret vote for all and the proportional representation of minorities. They're going to throw you in jail. I'll throw them a little something and they'll keep their mouths shut. All this heat. And the mosquitoes eating me alive. Mosquitoes? Because at your hometown there are no mosquitoes, right? No, there aren't. Get some pest repellent, then. What for? So the whole house smells like crap? One month. That's what you said. Here I am. With this heat, the mosquitoes and that filthy river that swallows everything. Darling, come over here. Come here, all right? - Come on... - Enough, Pinilla. Enough! Let's go through the bog. Let me give them some. - Morning. - Morning. - How are you, Yajaira? - Fine. Hilario's here. - Lizardo! - Hilario. How are you? Come here. I have some business for you. That's me. - Listen. - What's up? - Some fishing. - Well, talk to me. But it's urgent. I have to make a delivery in San Cristobal. Good money? You know I always pay good money. You have people? I have my people, a motorboat and everything. - Really? - Yes. That's good. So I can count on you for that? Sure. You know my people are ready for everything. I'm talking heavy fishing. About a thousand kilos. That's us. You'll see what you do with the money and all that. Don't worry. - Fine. - All right. Talk to you later. Wait right there. I have a present for you. Look, I heard the catch is good near La Colorada. We'll go over there, then. - Talk to you later. - See you. What's with the bottle? Mind your own business and I'll mind my own. So you got paid with liquor? That's some payment. What's up, Monaguitas? How are you? - What's up, Juan? - Hey. Your brother in law has an engine? What for? For some good fishing I need to do. - We're talking good money. - How much are we talking about? - How much do you make in a day? - At least a thank you. Good. You'll make more than a thank you. - What about the engine? - Same thing. If you get paid, the engine will be paid as well. - My bud here is with me. - He's coming, then. You won't put food on the table if you're just sitting there. - You can count on it. - Talk to you later. Brother, I came for you. What's up, brother? What are you up to? Good fishing and good money. You know you're my man. Count me in, but you know I can't drink. Don't worry. You have your net? - Yes. - Bring it with you. You can count on it. Good. See you there in 20 minutes? - No problem. - See you. Let's make peace, baby. How much longer are we going to fight? If I don't go get the beans no one moves a finger. Can't even pick up your own plate. Pinilla! That's your husband right there. Go see what he wants. That's what you're good for. - Cut it out. That's enough. - Yes, sure. - What's up? - I need you. We have some great fishing to do. - I'm your man. Count me in. - Let's go, then. - What's up? - Hey. - Let's go now. - You go ahead. I have to... No, no. I came to get you now. - Come on. The wife is coming. - You need the bottle to work? Only people at bars need bottles to work. Pinilla doesn't work with rum. Not with rum, but with us he does. - Come on, man. - Yes, I'm coming. I'm not leaving without you. What's the matter? I'll be right with you. Who's the boss here? The rooster or the hen? - Both. You go ahead. - Come on. We'll send him back fresh as a daisy. Take your fuss somewhere else! The guys should be at the shore by now. Yes, they're there. They're just waiting for us. - Carnero. - What's up? Good money. Not the usual "I'll pay tomorrow or the day after." None of that. This guy pays right away. Monaguitas! Well, there's the engine. Go do your thing. Thanks a lot, man. I'll let him know. You know how it is. You go ahead and work. Talk to me, mosquito head! Chumba! You should come with us and sing on the boat. But I want to bring my friends. It's too much people. - Just these guys right here. - No, too many people. - I'm going. - Too many people. All right. Get in the boat! Go ahead and get in the boat. Let him go, man. You responsible for that? Don't worry. All they want is some soup and rum. We're bringing a bunch of drunks up the river? - Is that what you want? - Let him go. Can't you see them? Don't worry about them. All they want is... - You're responsible for them. - Come on. It's fine. What's up, mosquito head? What's up? Fishing. There's some soup and great fishing. Is there any money, though? If you work for it instead of standing on the tip of the boat like a pretty girl, there might be. - OK. I'm in. - Great. Hop in. - Chumba! - I'm coming. Let's go. Listen, I don't want trouble when we split the money... Look who's coming. What? The woman let you out or what? Kind of in a hurry, right? We were about to leave, man. What happened? The lady set you free or something? No, man. I have to work. You just tell me and I'm there. Did you run away from home? Look, man, stop it. I'm not having any more of that crap. I don't know why you have to bring him. Go to the boat. What's all that stuff for? - For the soup? - What soup? We're going fishing and have some soup. Hold on. Are we going to work, fish or what? Work and fish. I won't share my drink, he likes it too much! No, he's a drunk! Caribe. This guy can't deliver not even using Caribe. Have I ever fucked you? Have I ever fucked you? - No. - So? One can tell seeing your lady. That lady needs a proper dick. Aminta! How are you, Mrs. Aminta? Hello, hello. Bless me. God bless you, Chumba, and keeps you away from rum. It's rum that finds me. I say "get away from me, rum," but it always comes back. This kid's too much. - How's Ursula doing? - She's fine. At Gonzalo's. - Say hi for me, OK? - Sure. Is Honorio around? Honey, go get your uncle for me, please. Hey, hey, leave those guavas alone! This is not your home! My friend, you see this young gal right here on the hammock and don't you feel an urge to invite her to dance? Oh, boy! I wonder what he's going to ask me for. You look so pretty laying there. Miguelito wants to go fishing with us. Let him come if he wants. How are you, man? - Can he come fishing with us? - That kid? But all those drunkheads can come? Fine, let him come. What? What's the deal? Fishing, man. I want you to come with us. - If it's coporo I'm in. - Let's go, then. Aminta, guess what we brought for you? Guess. A little present. What could it be? A big fat hen for you to make us some of that awesome soup of yours. See how happy she gets? I knew you wanted something. You're hungry, that's all. We got the vegetables all cleaned up, so you don't have to mess your pretty hands. Right, right. I knew there was a reason for that sweet-talking. That's why you get screwed. Fine, bring it here before I regret it. Chumba you have a gift to convince my mom. You better learn! - Let's go, then. - Let's go. Too many trunks! Throw back a drink! Coming! Aminta, what are you doing out here? Come on in. I'm so sorry to disturb you. Would you like some coffee or something? No, dear. I'm fine. I don't want anything. - Some juice? - No, thank you. Yajaira, have you heard anything about your brother? No. What would I know about him? They asked me to make some soup for them, but I haven't heard back from them. They're probably drinking. Miguelito, my grandson, is with them. Oh, God. They took him to the other side to baptize him, that's it. He's with all those saints. What do you think? - Torres, change that crap. - Which channel you want? No, leave it. Breaking news from El Observador. 14 alleged Colombian guerrillas were killed in a confrontation with officials of the José Antonio Páez commando of the Venezuelan army. The clash that took place in La Colorada, near Guafitas... Cheers to that. Our correspondent Marino Vásquez reports. The bodies of the 14 subversives ended up scattered over one mile of jungle. Their mission was to blow up the gas station of Corpoven, of the Guafitas oil well, as reported by general Humberto Camejo Arias, chief of the second... What's up, Mendieta? On duty? Trying to get rid of the mosquitoes and getting some fresh air. My fan is busted. I wanted to get some of that coffee the kid makes. But you can come in. It's not an oven. Come on in. All right. What's with those people playing cards at the square? Isn't that illegal? Aren't you the authority here? If I'm going to lock up every gambler in town, there would be no room for me in here. That's true. The light bulb is dead. Bermudez, make some coffee! That kid seems to be deaf. Bermudez! Don't worry. I'm on my way out anyway. How come you're bringing fish at this hour? Did you watch the news? How could I do that? The kid spends the whole day watching soap operas. Why? What happened? A group of rebels was going to blow up the refinery. I tell you, if it wasn't for those people this here would be a lot quieter, right? Here's some. - Morning. - Morning. - How are you, Yajaira? - All right. Fine. Have you heard from your brother? No. Why would I? Monaguitas went fishing with him yesterday and he hasn't come back. If he's with my brother the only thing they could have fished is a hangover. He knows that if he does that he'll sleep with the chickens. Then go prepare that coop for him. - Bye, Yajaira. - Bye. Have you heard from Juan? - Your husband? - Yes. No, no, no. You're not going anywhere. My cousin said he got on a boat with a bunch of people and your brother. They surely are all passed out down the river. They're saying some guerrillas were killed around there. - Who said that? - The news. - Really? - Didn't you hear? - How about you? - No. If they had been drinking they'd be here by now. Let's be patient. They probably found a lot of fish and decided to stay. I hope so. We've been waiting for that fish for a while now. Yes, but so many of them left and not one is back? It's strange. I saw Chumba and that brother of yours yesterday drinking. That's true, but yesterday on TV they said a bunch of guerrillas were killed at La Colorada. But that's different. That's someone else. Those people were in Guafita. Why don't you make a round and see if you can find out something? I don't think so. That car is all messed up. It won't even start. What if something happened to them? How do we know? What could've happened? They're sleeping it over in some ranch. But yesterday Pinilla swore to me he'd be back early because we had some things to take care of. He promised. And he never does that. Of course not. I'm sure he's in some hammock somewhere. Mendieta, why don't you send Bermudez on a bike? - To find out what happened. - We'll go later. Take it easy. Going out now to find a bunch of drunk guys? - Just a quick round. - No, we can't now. Just go and see. But where would we go? Where would we try to find them? If anything comes up we'll let you know. At what time? At the end of the afternoon, when the sun goes down. But that'd be too late. You have to go early. It's not late. The sun is blazing right now. Relax, ladies. Relax. Go make lunch. Here you go. You didn't go to school today. I'll let you know if I hear anything. - We'll be around, OK? - Yes, yes. They're just drunk. They'll piss you off. I'm sure they are dead drunk, and they didn't catch no fish. Careful! Oscar! - Yes? - Are you Mr. Mendieta? Can you come out, please? I'm the foreman for the Torrealbas. Some men got to the ranch covered in mud yesterday. That was right after the shootout in La Colorada. One of them says he's a friend of yours and he's asking for you. Not my friend. Friend of yours. So he says. He's called Chumba. - Chumba? - Yes, sir. - How many are there? - Two. Him and a younger one, darker, Pinilla. Wait here. Bermudez, call headquarters. Tell them some people turned up at La Colorada. - Guerrillas? - I don't know. Let's go. He's coming. Thank God you're here. Thank God you're here. We were going fishing and they almost stuff us full of bullets. What happened to you? Where was that? - La Colorada. - Yes, at La Colorada. - What were you doing there? - We were fishing. Fishing? What happened to your leg? Running through the bushes. What about your eye? Some spike that got into my eye. - Since when you fish with him? - I had to. Tell me the truth. What were you doing? That was it. - How many with you? - A whole bunch. About 15. Give or take. There was Lizardo, Monaguitas, his helper... What's his name? - Juan. - Juan, Jairo. The Colombian guy, the one with the accordion, Aminta's kid, his son. Catilde's nephews were there too. Right. Those guys that are always hanging out at the shore. They were there too. Rafucho, Pig Face, Cat Head, Pablo, Rafa... Let's go to the station. What's the matter? You want to throw us in jail? Yesterday the army killed a lot of people at La Colorada. They say they were guerrillas. What does it have to do with anything? They were 14. I just told you we were fishing. We were ready. We had the net and everything. We were all set when we heard shots and jumped in the river. Lizardo didn't tell you? Monaguitas? Right. Lizardo didn't tell you? And the guys? They never made it back. You think they're stranded somewhere? Tell me the truth, man. What happened? Come on, Curso. Would you rather come with me or go with someone else? Maybe they're all there. With Lizardo. With Rafa and Pablo. Yajaira, why don't you tell that woman to stop praying? Nothing's happened. Leave her alone. Who can argue with that old lady? It's freaking me out. Don't mind her. Yes, because maybe they're around somewhere. Oh, God. - What happened? - Where are the others? Talk to me! Where is he? Where's my husband? Bermudez! Bermudez! Where are they? Where are they? What happened? Tell me what happened! - What happened? - Tell me! Tell me what happened! Where are they? Tell me what happened! Close the door! Where are they? Where are they? Mendieta, let him go home! Let's go home! Let's go home! Where is my husband, Mendieta? Arias! Take it out. Go, go. Walk. Go, go. Go, go. Mendieta, what is this? I know this is serious, but I think this is too much. Give me a hand. Mendieta, we were fishing. Listen, no one is going to shoot a group of fishermen. The Army doesn't do that. Get in there. But let me talk to you, Mendieta. There was Lizardo, the kid, Rafucho, Pig Face, Pablo... We were all there. Mendieta, it's not like that. Let me tell you how it all went down. We jumped in the river and swam. Are you a guerrilla? Hey, you asshole, can't you hear me? Are you a guerrilla or not? Do I look like a guerrilla to you? What do you know what guerrillas look like? I'm sure you know. You've probably killed a few. They say that when they were fishing someone started shooting them. Of course I know them. They live here. They're my neighbors. Of course... No, no. I'm not arguing that. Yes, but if they mixed them up in something they didn't do... They told me this man asked them to do some fishing... Hello? Hello? This piece of shit broke. Sheriff Mendieta? Colonel Materano. You want to talk to these guys? To the survivors? Survivors of what, Mendieta? What we had yesterday was a confrontation. But maybe there was a mistake. They told me they were going fishing and someone started shooting at them. Mendieta, you did your job. Let me do mine. Open the gate. The colonel wants to talk to you. Come in. Wait here. - What's your name? - Arias. - Arias what? - Jose Augusto, sir. - Wolmer Pinilla. - Get out. - No, I'm staying here with... - Get out, please. Have a seat, Arias. Sleep well? The sheriff just told me you were at La Colorada. Is that true? Tell me. My general, we... ...we left from here. When we were at the river we heard shots from the left... No, no. There must be some mistake. There must be some mistake because there was a confrontation against a guerrilla group that started shooting when the commando was approaching. My general... My colonel, sorry. I think you made a mistake. - There was no mistake, Arias. - Maybe you got confused... No, the only one confused is you, Arias. The only one confused here is you. Because if you were there, then you're a guerrilla and you're going to jail. And if you were not there, then you're lying and you're going to jail anyway. But, my colonel, I really think you made a... Arias! Were you there, yes or no? Murderers! Murderers! How are you, Pinilla? Those people are pissed, huh? Do you back up what your friend said? Were you at La Colorada yesterday? Yes, yes. We were going to La Colorada. I was telling Mendieta... Listen, Pinilla, I won't deny the army sometimes makes mistakes. When that happens we admit it. But what happened yesterday was serious work, a thorough investigation, and you're committing an act of slander. Do you know what slander is? You don't, right? You and your friend are smearing the President of the Republic and the Venezuelan Army. The penalty for that is prison. Did you hear that, Arias? - Take them away. - Let's go. Wait a minute. Where is the warrant signed and sealed? Get me some paper and a pen and I'll write it for you. No, no. You know the rules. You have to respect the institutions. I respect yours and you respect mine. You bring me the warrant and you can take them. Otherwise you don't. You know how it is. Don't act like you don't. - Calzadilla, take them away. - Don't play deaf. I said no. I said no, goddamn it! You bring me that shit signed and sealed and you can take them. And you two, get in that fucking cell and lock yourselves up. Put the gun down. What's the matter, Mendieta? What's going on? What's going on? You want to fuck us up. You guys are evil! Don't play stupid with me! Don't play stupid with me! You know the rules! Get me the papers and you get the men! You're screwing yourself and those poor guys. You two are getting screwed, you bastards! You know what, Mendieta? Sooner or later you and those guerrillas in there are coming out of here in chains. You two are getting out here now, before I blow your head off like a fucking snake! Come on, get out of here! Out, I said! Move it! Where are you going? I want to talk to Mendieta. You're in trouble. Remember when we were in the army? I used to send letters to my mother. One every other week. She never received one single letter. Look. They sent me a reprimand on the very same day for contempt. Let's see how long we can hold here. - Where's Pinilla? - Toilet. Still? Pinilla, that toilet is going to swallow you. You've been there all day. ...the event took place at 11:30 am this Saturday. Two members of the group of alleged insurgents that were presumed dead at the bottom of the river, managed to escape. Wolmer Gregorio Pinilla and Jose Augusto Arias, who gave themselves up to a police commission and are at El Amparo waiting for a district attorney... - Tell Mendieta we're here. - You can't come in. We're not saying we want to come in. I'm just asking you to please tell Mendieta Pinilla's wife is out here. I don't know if I want to see him. Rubita, don't leave your husband alone. Don't worry so much about Pinilla. He always manages to land on his feet. Rubita, there's a lot of dead people being grieved. They're the only ones who know for sure. Besides, Torres says they want to set them up. Stay alert, OK? We brought some food and clean clothes for the boys. These guys are in jail. They cannot have visitors like that. I know, but this is not a visit. It's just food and some clean clothes. Besides, this is his wife. Help us out. Only one can come. Don't forget, Rubita. Don't forget. What? No good? What? The food? No, it's delicious, baby. With those blessed hands you have for cooking? Are you sick? No, don't say that. I'm fine. What is that, then? Just a gash I got when I was running through the bushes. You know, so they wouldn't get me and all that. What I was telling you. Pinilla, tell me the truth. Are you one of those men they talk about on TV? No, how can you say that? You sleep with the TV or with me? Don't piss me off. Morning. Ma'am, we'd like to offer our condolences. The President of the Republic does. He would like to meet with you. You have some nerve! We've never seen a president at El Amparo. You would come with me to Caracas. Oh, that makes more sense. Look, tell him all we want is that they to stop saying they were guerrillas on TV. That's not true. Ma'am, unfortunately that day... I don't want to know about that day. Look, ma'am, we just want to help. - In exchange for what? - Nothing. Nothing at all. But I suppose your son left a widow, daughters, sons. We just want them to go to school and to grow up as good people. He has two sons. One of them died with him. I'm very sorry, ma'am. I really am. Look... All we want is to help you have a better home. Live better. You don't have to be blamed for what they did. Listen... ...my son and my grandson are not cattle you can pay for. Were you involved in something, Chumba? My brother? Chumba, look me in the eye and tell me the truth. Was my brother involved in that? He was a good man. You know what was the last thing I said to him? I cursed him because he stole one of my hens. That was the hen for the soup. - Hello. - Hello. - How are you, ma'am? - Fine. How can I help you? I'm Hilario. I can only imagine how you feel for what happened and all that. - So sad. - Sad is right. At least Pinilla is fine, right? He's not that fine. He's alive and that's different. He's in jail. Everyone says he did, but I know he did nothing wrong. Yes, I know that too. Of course he didn't. But who's going to believe him? Besides, you know I am the one who asked them to go fishing and I feel terrible about that. Those fish were for me and I haven't been able to sleep since then, thinking how such good people could've been killed like that. You never know, though. Maybe one of them was undercover there. So the innocent has to pay for that, Pinilla? Look, I'm here to help. I know we don't know each other, but I need to give you some advice. Go talk to Pinilla and tell him not to contradict those people. If they tell him he's a guerrilla, fine, he's a guerrilla. But if he says that they'll lock him up for 100 years. No, that's where I come in. I promise I'll get him out. Because if he keeps contradicting them, he could spend years and years in there, trying to prove his innocence and all that, and that's not easy. But if he says he's guerrilla I can get him out fast. I know people. How about a lawyer? Aminta says she knows a lawyer. Talk to him and I'll get him out. When he gets out of there, he'll have a house and a truck to work. I'll see what I can do. Let me help him, OK? Thank you. Thank you. All right. I try to remember what was the last thing Lizardo told me, but I can't remember. My head hurts from thinking so hard. We think too much nonsense. Have you thought that maybe one of those guys with us could've been a guerrilla in disguise? Juan, for instance, Yara's husband. What makes you think that, Pinilla? Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Thinking that about Juan? What about Jairo? Because he's Colombian he's got to be a guerrilla? I understand your pain, but I did what I always do, I gave him work. And they killed them. True. Look, I'm here because I want to give you a hand, so that it's not so hard on you. Some of them are negotiating. I think they even offered them a house. They'll say what they have to say. I don't mean to disrespect your pain, but no matter what they say, if they believe them, what will you do? Some already understood. Elina, for instance, she took the help. What will you do? Wait for what? Think about what's next. I don't know, about yourselves, for yourselves, for the dead. Everything that starts well here always ends bad. Please, get out of my house. Well, don't forget I'm here to help. I'm here to help. If you ever change your mind, I can talk to those people. Please. I don't know, I'm scared. It's not like I'm here singing party songs. Pinilla... ...don't you think it'd be better if you say yes? Yes what? That you are what they say. Are you out of your mind? You're giving me that too? Lower your voice, Pinilla! Let them kill me if they want, but I'm not going to say I did something I didn't. - They're going to hear you! - Let them hear. I will not say I did something I didn't. Pinilla, if you don't they will kill you. Mr. Hilario told me if they take you out of here, they'd kill you. But I wasn't doing anything. Mr. Hilario also told me he could help you. He says he knows people that can help you, but you have to take the blame. He says it's faster that way. He says it's faster like that. You'd be out in two years. He also said we could get some money and maybe a house. What the fuck is the matter with you and Hilario? Since when you talk to Hilario? Hilario offering houses? Since when? Hilario's a politician now or what? What's the matter with you? Saint Hilario! You're going to get jealous now? Not jealous. But the difference between the dead's wife and the prisoner's wife is the dead never finds out. You'll never learn. Instead of worrying about what you need to worry. I wasn't doing anything. I won't say I did something I didn't do. Pinilla, will you ever learn? Cut that crap and listen to me for once in your life! Your friends you listen to, but your wife never. Pinilla, I don't want to see you dead. Hello. Where are you headed? El Amparo. May I see some ID, please? And registration. So you're a journalist. You too? No, cameraman. How much longer to El Amparo? No, no. You've made it. Thanks. We're at El Amparo, state of Apure, where today, Saturday October 29, there was a shoot-out between the Special Command José Antonio Páez and a subversive group of the Colombian guerrilla. That's what official sources reported. However, yesterday we heard from two alleged survivors who deny this version. Why don't you talk to those TV people? What for? Didn't you hear we're "alleged"? - So they help you, guys. - Help us sink. How do you know if they're guerrilla or not? He's my brother in law and everyone here knows he's good people. And Pinilla. They might as well take his picture make a religious stamp out of him. Relax, man. What? Relax. It's the truth, Torres. And that Chumba. That's the patron saint of all drunks. He might be a drunk, but he's not a guerrilla. Everyone knows he wasn't. But we're all going to get fucked for defending those two. You might be a guerrilla. I'm not a guerrilla. I'm nothing but a grocer. Chill out. An expensive grocer. Expensive? Look, you give those two a couple of bucks and they're out of here. Chill out, man. Everyone knows he's good people. He's my brother in law. He might be your brother in law, but he's a guerrilla. He's got two kids and another one coming. Don't be so disrespectful. She's going to give birth, not him. I could just kick your ass right here. Come again? Whose ass you're going to kick? Hold on, hold on. Do what you're going to do. Come kick my ass, then! Goddamn it, I want to get the fuck out of here. Rubita was right. About what? Come here. Come. I'm going to tell you something, but don't tell Mendieta. If we do as we're told we might even get a house. Who, Pinilla? You don't think about those people out there? Can't you see they want to screw us? Can't you see whoever's offering you that house wants to screw you too? I don't want to know about anything. I just want to get out of here. I don't want to know about fishermen, dead people or crying women. I just want to go away from here with my wife. Me too! I want to get the fuck out here too, but telling the truth! What truth? You keep talking about that fucking truth! You think the truth is going to get us out of this shit? Look at me, look at yourself! We're just a couple of fishermen with nothing to our name! What the fuck is wrong with you? What the fuck is wrong with you, Pinilla? Again with that? I may be just a poor devil, but I'm honest, damnit! Not like you, fucking sell out! Sheriff. I'm Doctor Saenz. I come from the DA's office. How are you, guys? Fine. Health all right? Yes, yes. Any accidents, injuries? I have this cut here, but that was when I was running through the bushes. Was it a bullet? No, no. How have you been treated here at the sheriff's office? Mendieta's been really good to us. Good. Gentlemen, the situation is complicated. My duty is to come here and tell you the charges against you. You claim to be survivors from La Colorada. Yes, to begin with... Very good. However, army officials state that they faced an armed group. If you say you were there and you survived that event, it could be presumed that you're part of that group. But to save you the trip and to cut time in all this, I took the liberty of drafting a document based on the official reports of the event. If you'll allow me... Mr. Jose Augusto Arias. Both documents are identical. They contain the same information. It's important that you sign this ASAP. The document reads... Wait. Hold on, brother. I don't understand why you want these men to sign that if that haven't even told you what happened there. No, no, of course. I'm here to inform you about this, too. I also need to hear your side of the story. Your statement. But this document will allow us to open a case. It will allow us to open an actual investigation in order to clarify this whole matter. The document reads... I, Wolmer Pinilla, Venezuelan, of legal age and in full possession of my faculties, declare that I was at La Colorada on October 29 this year in a boat coming from Colombia, heading to the refinery of... Wait, wait. That's a lie, Mr. district attorney. Mr. Arias, this is only a preliminary statement. But it's a lie. This will allow us to open... But how can you ask us to sign a lie? You came here to listen to us. Precisely. You came here to listen to us? Precisely. I'm here to listen to your statements. I'm here to listen to your side of the events, but first I need you to sign this document, so that we can compare your statements with this and establish the truth. If we can get this document signed we can proceed with the investigation. Can you understand the importance of this document, Mr. Wolmer? Yes, yes. Then I need you to sign as soon as possible. If you'll allow me. I, Jose Augusto Arias, in full possession of my faculties, as you put it here, declare that I'm nobody. A man that never had the balls to be a soldier, who was dumped by two women, who works on whatever he can, who works laying bricks, fishing, mixing concrete, but I'm none of what your official version says I am, sir. That day we were going fishing, so I'm not signing this paper, sir. I'm sorry, but I'm not signing all this bullshit. Mr. Wolmer, do you understand the importance of this document? Of course I do. Without this we cannot start an investigation and this will become a huge burden for you. Can you hear those people out there? Did you see the faces of those people out there? Did you? All those people are relatives, mothers, wives, children of the victims. We were going fishing that day. We were going fishing. Mr. Arias, consider that this is a preliminary statement. This will open an investigation process. Mr. Wolmer, you follow me on this, yes? Yes, yes. I need you to sign this document. Without this we can't proceed. You'll have to forgive me, sir, but I'm not signing this. I'm sorry. Well, you heard them. None of them is signing that farce, so please, leave. Whenever you're willing to sign, please, let me know. Excuse me. Did you talk to the survivors? I cannot offer any statements at the moment. Could you tell us how they are? They are perfectly healthy. Do not worry. I cannot offer any statement about this. The people involved in this case are aware of the situation. Now we have to wait. Thank you very much. Well, these were the statements of the DA... There she is. What are you going to do? I'm going to ask her. Don't get in trouble. Elina. Elina. Did you take the money? Did you take that money? If you keep that money is like saying they're right. You'll let them say that about Monaguitas? Yajaira, leave her alone. Don't you feel ashamed for your kids? Monaguitas is dead. Lizardo's dead too. They're all dead. But what those people are saying is not true. That's not true. What truth? You're going to help her raise her children? You can't eat the truth. You can't put it on a plate. Or in a baby bottle. And you? You better look out or you'll end up a widow. You hear me? Let's go, Elina. Did you hear me? Let's go. Morning. Black coffee, please. Coming right up. Morning. Congressman. Mrs. Alba. We're going to check the transmitter. Thank you. Now? Excuse me. Go on. I hope you don't mind me sitting here with you. No, it's all right. I suppose you didn't come to have breakfast with me. You're here for the survivors? Here's your coffee. Excuse me. Thank you. Can I get you anything else? No, thank you. I came for both. Have you interviewed them yet? No. It's interesting that such a serious and complicated case for the government is getting so much coverage. In other cases I can't even get an intern, and I've called you personally. This president is making too many mistakes. My duty is to report it. That's why I'm here. Certainly. But we air the dirty stuff while we're at it. Are you suggesting I have a personal agenda in this? You're going to shine in Congress too. The case will look so good on you. "Mr. Congressman savior of the survivors." That's personal interest. We all have personal interests. But your cameras keep those guys from getting killed or missing. We all look for something, Albita. The legal way would be for you to come with me to the DA's office to talk to a representative, and the investigations would start from there. In the meantime we could get a head start talking to the media. Give them your side of the story. That easy, huh? The government doesn't want you talking. This is not easy at all. What do you get out of this? Sir, my reputation as a lawyer is at stake here. As a member of Parliament. Based on what? Your word? You might very well be flirting with the guerrilla and taking us all for a ride. We're telling the truth, sir. What do we do with the truth? We can yell it out there in the square. What would we get? Absolutely nothing. Those people you want us to talk to called us guerrilla. That's exactly why. People don't know your version, and as long as that is the case, the version of the army and the government wins, and you'll be guerrillas, and your dead friends will be guerrillas. How much are you getting for doing all this? Mr. Arias, stop this bullshit! This is not bullshit. Forgive me for saying this. Some people from that DA's office came here to make us sign a document that was not true. Saying lies about us. And a man from the army came too. I've done my homework too. I investigated. But I don't come pretending I'm someone I'm not. I'm here showing my face. Institutionally. So? Look, sir, you don't know us, and we don't know you. Go back to where you came from. Fine. I'm leaving. What are you going to do? We'll figure it out. You'll figure it out. How much longer you think you have left in this cell? Not long, gentlemen. What's going to happen when the media losses interest? They have to find something to do. Then what? When no one knows what's going on at El Amparo, they will come, they'll take Mendieta away, fire him, and you two will go missing. It's that easy. The people? They'll mourn and move on. Who will defend you? What about the truth? What about your friends' reputation? They'll be guerrillas forever? Mendieta! This man is leaving. Mendieta! What are we going to do? I don't know. But it's all very weird that they keep coming here offering to help us? Why? What if they come up with a document we don't know about? And we get screwed for good? I'm so glad to see you. I've been thinking about you all day. What's with the bags? My mom called and she's waiting for me. You're leaving? It's quieter over there. I know you're in serious trouble, and I know your friends died. But I can't wait for you to make up your mind. I can't wait any longer. Do me a favor. Drop me a letter every once in a while. Rubita, Rubita! Did you talk to Pinilla? No. He will never listen to me. Go back in there and talk to him. Tell him there's lots of money. The government is willing to pay whatever they want. If you care so much, why don't you go and tell him yourself? Mendieta, ask those people to come. Where should I put it? Over there. Here? Yes. Could you move it a bit more towards the wall? A bit more. There. Give me just one second to get ready. Let me get the machine. Testing, one, two, three. Testing, testing. It's blinding. It's only going to be for a little while. How are you? Fine. Good? Relax. I'm just going to ask you a few questions, you tell me your story. It's going to be quick. We're here with Wolmer Pinilla and Jose Augusto Arias, the two alleged survivors of what's now known throughout the country as the Massacre of El Amparo. We're going to talk to them and listen to their story. Could you tell us what happened that Saturday, October 29? Well, Jose Augusto and me... He's Jose Augusto, but we call him Chumba. That day we were going with some friends to La Colorada for some fishing. They'd told us there was a lot of coporo out there. But when we got there they shot us. - Didn't they shout a warning? - We never heard any warning. So, what did you do, then? I know someone jumped in the water first, and then I felt someone pushing me. That was Chumba that pushed me and said: "Get in the water quick!" Right. So you were the only two that jumped in the water? You were the only survivors of this event? After that, we didn't hear anything else from our friends or about what happened to them. There's an official version that says that you're guerrillas. That your intention was to put some explosives at the oil facilities. That in your boat you had maps and a list of local ranchers. What can you tell us about that? All those things they're saying are lies. Have you had any visits from your relatives or friends? Have they come here? Have you been able to talk to them? My wife came by a few times. She talked to me and told me about things outside. What would you like to tell Venezuela right now? Why are you here giving us this interview? We are not what they say we are. Those people that disappeared, they were good people. They were really good people. They have mourners and families. Let them rest in peace, and don't say they were doing things they were not doing. They were hardworking people trying to make a living. We were just going fishing. What we want is justice. That those people who did those evil things must know that we're willing to die for the truth. So that all our friends may rest in peace. That their names are free from all things they're saying, and that we're all in with the truth. Good. Well, formerly alleged guerrillas, they are now alleged survivors. Now we have to wait for the investigations of the judiciary, and for whatever response the State can offer. Stay in tune. We'll be back with more later. After an arrest warrant issued by a military judge, Chumba and Pinilla had to leave El Amparo for a brief exile in Mexico. Years later, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights decided against the Venezuelan State, demanding compensation for the families of the victims, the continuation of the investigation of the events, and the punishment of those responsible for the massacre. The Venezuelan Government complied with part of the sentence by compensating the relatives of the 14 fishermen murdered at La Colorada. 28 years have gone by. Chumba and Pinilla are still living in El Amparo and continue demanding that the case be moved from military to ordinary courts. As of this date, no administration has paid attention to the request.
