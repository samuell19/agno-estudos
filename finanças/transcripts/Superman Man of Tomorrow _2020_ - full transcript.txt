I know what you are. You're not one of us. What are you talking about? I look like everyone else. No. I saw your files. You're... you're... An alien? Aliens are scary. Aren't you glad they're not real? Mom! Thanks for calling, Deb. I mean, it wasn't even that scary. He just gets a little jittery. So that movie really bothered you, huh? You didn't say anything, did you? It's been days! It's not healthy. It's a weak prescription. Anyway, you try taking them away. Now he spends every waking minute, trying to get that thing to work. Maybe we shouldn't have told him. He lifted a tractor with one finger, Martha. He was gonna figure it out. I don't want him to feel different. He is different. And it scares him, for good reason. Whoever put him in that ship had no idea or care for how dangerous a world they were sending him to. The more he knows, the more he can protect himself and us. We're supposed to protect him, Jonathan. Not the other way around. Right over left. - Now, right over... - No! Left over right! The image is flipped on this thing. What? No, it isn't. It's okay. I can manage. You both worry too much. Shouldn't we? I can't read that, Mom. It's... You have to pull back from the... "Flying Man of Metropolis, Spotted Over South Side." That's the third story in two months. Metropolis isn't Smallville. There are powerful people there, who would love nothing more than to get their hands on... You. Please, be careful. I will. I am. Now, I really do have to get to work. Everyone's counting on me. I'm a big part of the team covering today's launch. Launch? Of what? You'll read about it tomorrow in the Daily Planet. I love you. Bye. Coffee boy! Over here. Here yo go, Mr. Troupe. Large skinny vanilla latte. No whip. And I hope you don't mind, I had them add a dash of cinnamon to the grinds. It really wakes it up. Mmm. Now, you know you don't have to call me Mr. Troupe. And uh, you don't actually have to call me... Coffee boy, get a move on! Excuse me. Mr. Luthor, what can you tell us about S.T.A.R. Labs? Today, is a great day for Metropolis. And indeed, the planet. With any luck, we'll soon have answered the age-old question, "Are we alone in the universe?" The good people at S.T.A.R. Labs are about to launch the most sophisticated, orbital telescope the world has ever seen. And it's all happening via a two-stage, liquid-fueled launch vehicle, built by none other than LexCorp. I'll only be taking one question. From the young woman in the back. Hello, Lois. Lois Lane, for those that don't know, is the recipient of the Luthor Journalism Scholarship. Haven't heard from you in months, Lois. Studies keeping you busy? I've definitely learned a lot. Like how you built that rocket with funds you received from a rather hefty government contract. This president knows a good investment, when he sees it. Does he know fraud when he sees it? Gross negligence. Not the question I expected, Lois. That's how business is done. I practically sat him in the Oval Office myself. He owes me. More champagne? Legally, it's opaque. So you set up a ten million dollar space program that the feds underwrite to the tune of six billion... The rockets are junk, but... "But who knows, they might fly, and anyone moronic enough to live close to a launch site deserves to be hit by fiery debris." I have copies, Lex. Well, I hope you enjoyed the champagne, at least? One at a time, please. One at a time. Looks like you could use this more than me. Oh, you're a life saver. Early shift. Mmm. Hmm. That cinnamon really wakes it up. Yeah. I think so, too. Shouldn't you be part of this feeding frenzy? No. Well, uh, yes. But, no. Well, I'm glad we cleared that up. Well, I mean, I'm not a reporter, not yet, anyway. Just an intern. How does an intern become a reporter? With a scoop like that. Three, two, one. We have lift off! That's nothing. I've seen stuff in there. Experiments. Bizarre weapons. Containment cells. All designed to neutralize the kind of weird powers you read about these days. Super speed. Strength. All that alien stuff. It's like, we're preparing for something. If you ask me, I'd say somebody already knows we're not alone in the universe. Can you get me inside? Helluva scoop, huh? But no, uh... I gotta work. My kid, he's in first grade. We got another on the way. What if my name came out? I protect my people. I think you're the one that might need protecting. Two tours in Iraq. I know a shadow when I see it. Someone's interested in you, kid. I'd watch your back. Look! Up in the sky! Whoa! Hey, maybe we should... Damn. You gotta be kidding me. Eyes up here! Everybody, come on. I know I don't say it very often, but I am always, always, looking out for you! We're a team. That's why I'm showing you what a real reporter looks like! Maybe knock some sense into the more worthless of you. - Oh, Jesus! - Oh, classic Perry! Anyway, meet the newest addition to the team. The grad student who took down a billionaire genius. An actual talent. Lois Lane. - A grad student? Are you kidding me with this? - Welcome, kid. Welcome to the team. See, now they hate you. That couldn't have gone better. Uh, Miss Lane. Don't worry, it's under control. There. Lois, by the way. Just... Lois. Cool. Just Lois. And you are? Oh, I'm coffee... Uh, Clark. I'm Clark Kent. Daily Planet. No kidding. Right. Sorry. I'm just... I was there at S.T.A.R. Labs. I saw what you did. It was amazing. That creep had it coming. Can I just... how did you do it? I mean, I know, the champagne. It wasn't like that. Trust me. People with that much power think they wield it over everyone. If you can take that away from them, for a moment, you can take it away for good. It's called a power move. And I don't want to brag, but it's kind of my specialty. Well that, and paper jams. Any other questions? If you're gonna be a reporter, kid, you gotta ask all the questions. It's just... what do you do now? You've already taken down the most powerful man in the world. Have I? Have a nice weekend, Coffee Boy! Uh, Lois, you left your... Hmm. All right. Breaking news. An unidentified object heading towards Earth was detected by S.T.A.R. Labs. Stay tuned for updates. Has anybody seen this thing? Do we have a visual? You gotta figure out what happened. - Does anyone know where it is? - Hold on one second. Why are you here? Why are you here? Kryptonian! What did you say? 'Course I never heard of no flying Kryptonian! But, whatevs. Guess we're doing this the fun way! Don't struggle now. You'll just make 'em vengeful. This planet is protected, alien. Alien? They ain't got mirrors on this dump? You're as alien as they come around here, Kryptonian. Kryptonian? I'm a Kryptonian. You're the Kryptonian. Last one in the universe tucked away in Sector 2814. You got an awful big bounty on that stupid looking head o' yers. You're here for me. So, I guess... I guess that means, you have to bring me in alive, bounty hunter. Name's Lobo. And... Nah. Mess with the main man, and you get the... Well, frag the shit out of me. You sure you're from Krypton? I'm from Kansas. Well, something about Kansas made you strong. Weird strong. I like it. It appears the flying man is headed towards the bay. Perhaps, he's had enough and is in retreat. Perhaps, he's trying to move the fight to safer ground. They're coming here. Go! Go! Move! I wonder... can you see in the dark! Agh! Agh! Get back! Purty, ain't it? You know I'm not one fer poetry, but seeing how it was Krypton itself killed yer people, s'only right this ring, carved from the remains of that doomed rock, should be the thing to mess you up. Huh? Agh! - Oh! What is that thing? - What in God's name... - Do you see that? - Let's get outta here! Tell me you're rolling. Roll tape! Roll tape! Well, how 'bout this? A goddamn Martian. Look! You were right. This was the fun way. Oh, my God, it's incredible! Great Caesar's ghost! It's been days, people! Days! I may be the managing editor, but I'm also a Daily Planet subscriber. I read the damn thing every day. Hell, I read it the night before every day and I still don't know Where are the aliens from? What do they want with us? And what are their weaknesses, if any? Chief, maybe if we... Are you talking or am I talking? You're talking. Damn skippy! And, yes, Troupe, we got a little carried away with coverage of the Flying Man. The Superman. Write it all you want, Lois, it's never gonna catch on. Listen up! The flying man is no longer the story. I want aliens. Everybody stop whatever you're doing and get me copy about the aliens! Well that's it. Get back to work. Speaking of the Superman, though I think Perry's right by the way, it's never going to catch on. Didn't you have an interview scheduled? Like five minutes ago? Oh, Clark. So innocent. I'm not going to that. See, right now, the Superman is waiting for me up there on the roof, getting more and more impatient. Ah, it's a "power move." It's a power move. Eventually, he'll give up and, if he's the egomaniac I think he is, he will beg me to reschedule. And when you do... Big Brave Strong Man will be putty in my hands. He'll answer anything. Where do you come from? Do you report to some kind of leader? It sounds like you think he's... Another alien? He flies and can push rockets. Of course he is. But, uh, what if he denies it? Then he's fallen right into my trap. See, by then, I'll have gotten the real truth from my interview with the loud, hairy one. Wait, you're interviewing Lobo? Isn't he locked up at S.T.A.R. Labs? He knows the Superman. He wants to take him down, but now he's behind bars. Lucky for Lobo, I'm not. So that's it. You took down Luthor and now you're doing an expose on the Flying Man? No. I'm winning a Pulitzer for my revelatory takedown of the alien who calls himself "The Superman." He doesn't call himself that! Not "Flying Man," not "Superman," not "Clark..." Certainly not "Kryptonian." It's everything you warned me about. They meet someone from the stars and their first instinct is to fire at will. They love you. They don't know me. And I'm afraid that, when they do... Maybe you're what they need. If they knew about you, maybe they'd see things differently. Or maybe the government will lock him up, or worse. At some point they're gonna ask me where I'm from and why I was sent here, and I won't have the answers. And in the meantime, one way or another, Lois is going to publish her expose. You know what we're gonna say. What we've always said. "The world is dangerous and unforgiving." If you're different, special, you have two options. You can either... "Either meet it head-on and accept the consequences, or you can keep your head down and accept the consequences. There's no wrong choice, but..." You have to make one. Why? Because you're not our little boy anymore. Becoming a man means making these choices for yourself. Just be ready, because each choice, each action, has a consequence. Excuse me, do we know... Nothing yet. Is Daddy gonna be okay? Here we go. Half the liver, one kidney, the spleen. Every day another organ fails. What the hell happened to this guy? I'm going to close him back up. Give me the... Code Black! Call it in! Go! Agh! Agh! I know it's not for good, but sure is nice having you here helping out, Clark. Pa, I can help anytime. It takes me less than ten minutes to get here from the city, you just have to let me know when... Clark? Stop the truck. Evening, stranger. I've come for your son. Our son isn't here. Something we can do for ya? You can tell me where he is. Sir, unless you want to show us some credentials, I think we're done here. Martha, get behind me. I'm sorry. Sorry for wh... Jonathan? What's happening? What are you doing to him? Get inside, lock the doors. Are you another bounty hunter? I am no Bounty Hunter. My name is J'onn. And I only wish to speak with you. Call me when you need the refill. Ahem. Next? Uh, did, uh, someone call in a prescription for you, sir? Pain... I have... so much... - Sir, you don't look... - Drugs. I'm sorry, without a prescription, I can't help you. But there is a clinic nearby where you can detox... I need to get home! I need... a post-surgical analgesic. Fentanyl. I need fentanyl! Huh? I apologize for frightening you earlier. - Are you... - I'm fine. Just don't get in my head again, okay? I'm sure you boys have a lot to talk about. Clark, if... John is staying over, there are sheets in the hall cupboard and... We're fine, Ma. G'night. I thought Martians only existed in the movies. Those movies are terrible. Thank you. For S.T.A.R. Labs. You saved my life. I should never have revealed my natural form. Why did you? I mean, if you can disguise yourself... To distract Lobo. He came for the last Kryptonian. I offered him something of equal value. You're... the last. You're like me. It was a foolish miscalculation. This world wasn't ready. Ready or not, Lobo came to us. That's when everything changed. Nevertheless, I will be reverting to human form and maintaining a low profile for the foreseeable future. I advise you to do the same. If we remain hidden, we live. Doesn't sound like much of a life. Perhaps not. But as the last survivors of our people, is self-preservation not our chief responsibility? I have seen firsthand how rampant xenophobia can destroy a great civilization. If humanity is to have a chance to thrive, we mustn't further stoke its fears. I don't think anything can stop that now. The Daily Planet is about to publish the truth about me. Then we must stop them. J'onn, this world is beginning to see me as some sort of champion. What if knowing the truth about me is what turns this around, makes people see things differently? You are an optimist, Kal-El. Like your father. Kal-El? Forgive me. When I first became aware that you possess abilities similar to my own, I assumed... hoped you were Martian. I attempted a telepathic link between our minds and in doing so, I inadvertently accessed your memories of Krypton. I have no memories of Krypton. You were only an infant. I've never been able to make this thing work. Is that... Your parents. I was able to pick up some Kryptonian from your memories of them. I could teach you and help you access those memories. But you should know that the last thing your mother ever said to you was that "to dwell in the past is to lose one's path." You have a weighty decision to make. I'll leave you to it. Wait. How will I find you? Just listen. Have you been up all night? Yeah, pretty much. Thank you. Twenty-four years collecting dust and your new friend gets it working in one try. So what is it? I don't know. Some kind of historical record? I've barely scratched the surface. It was incredible, Ma. I can't believe I'll never get to see it. Maybe you will. I'm beginning to think you can do almost anything. Go anywhere. Only... What? You can go anywhere, but, as all those photos posted all over the world show, your clothes can't. Did you make this? From the only fabric I know that's been to outer space. You were swaddled in it when we found you. Otherwise, I just copied the design of that nice Batman I always see in the papers at the checkout. You even did the cape. Now I don't know if it'll hold up to the stress you'll put it through, but we went through 16 bandsaw blades just to cut the fabric, so... Whattaya think? I think you're saying you want me to tell the world who I really am. No, I'm saying we're not buying you any more nice clothes to destroy. I love it, Ma. Thank you. It's out! Well? It's only part one. She's teasing something big, but won't say what until she interviews Lobo. I have to get back to Metropolis. Maybe I can get her to put the brakes on while I figure out what to do. What about your laundry? I'll get it later. Love the suit, especially the cape! You added a cape? I think it looks cool. Stop it! Oh, don't like that one? How 'bout this: "I met an old female in heat" Stop! Oh, my God! What is wrong with you? Why don't I show ya? Come on, girlie. Good for you? Last question. You told me he's the only one of his people here on Earth. Are there more on the way? Kryptonians? Yeah, they're on their way all right. A whole army comin' just for him. And those bloodthirsty sons of bitches don't care who they gotta liquify to get 'im. Nah! Jes' kiddin'. They're all dead, but you shoulda seen the look on yer face though! Classic! And then summa this. And summa that. And then I give it a little bit 'o wam-bam-boom... Ugh. All right, that's enough. That's enough. That wasn't even half the Appellaxian mating dance. I don't blame ya, - I'm a whole lotta man... - We're done here. Open up. What on Earth... Maybe you should run along now, sweetybits. You... You did this! Hey, man, I jes' work here. What's happening to me? Okay then. Now where'd those assholes put my bike. Are you all right, Miss Lane? I think so. Paramedics are on their way. But I have to go after him. Superman? You're right about my origins, Lois, but not my intentions. Please don't run your story. I should be the one to tell the world. First you have to save it. We're overdue for that interview. Maybe when this is over. I'll be there. No games, I promise. And Superman... Don't let him touch you. What the hell? Let them go. Nice work. Now let's get these people to safety before... Go! I'll try to hold him back. So... much... power! Oh, yes... Yes... More... How are we doing J'onn? Yes... Yes... Kent. The intern... Or is it Kal-El? No, don't touch him. J'onn J'onzz... the manhunter... Stop this. Please. No. No, please. Ahhh. Oh! Clark! Hey, Clark! - Clark? - It was unlocked. What happened? I, uh... I broke the glass. No kidding. I mean, what were you doing in the middle of the attack yesterday? How did you know? You gave a statement to the police. You know, Clark, there are much easier ways to get the story. There are? No! Actually running in there was exactly what I should have done. Why are you here? Perry read the police report and asked me to check on you. Actually he ordered me to fire you for not showing up today but I think I got the translation right. Well, did you see him in action? Who? The Superman. Oh. Yeah. And the Martian Manhunter. The Martian Manhunter? That's terrible. But it's your story so... It burnt him alive, Lois. That Parasite thing. I can still hear the screams. And the Superman? I think he's dead, too. Lois, this job... Not what you expected? It's so much harder... this whole story. I'd only just gotten started and now I think I may have lost it. Maybe for good. Clark. You've chosen a job that can put you face to face to some pretty bad stuff. You try and make a difference and fight for truth, justice, and sometimes you get smacked down. But let me tell you, Clark Kent. If this is what you want, if it's who you are, then you have to do it. But this job takes guts. It takes risk. And maybe one of those risks is, when you feel overwhelmed to open yourself up and ask someone smarter than you for help. Someone smarter than me? I bet, they're closer than you think. You're totally right. Perfect. First, give me your source. Lois, did you come here to steal my story? What? No! No! I thought that we would share it. You know what, thanks for coming, Lois. Really, thank you. Tell Perry he can't fire me because I quit. For now, sorry, I got to go. What? Where? To talk to someone smart. I was going to split the byline. Is it still Halloween? No. Let's just say, it's more practical than cargos and aviator caps. Ah-ha. And what's the "S" for? Superman. Right. Well, Superman, what's this about? I need your help. I've seen you in action, flyboy. You're as powerful as a locomotive. More. Usually. So how could I possibly help you? I need to get into space. Fast. Not the most practical getaway plan. The sun! It's like a power source for you, isn't it? And if you need help getting closer to it, that means you're... powerless. Interesting. You've seen the news reports. This creature, this Parasite. It killed my friend. Now everyone is in danger and I can't stop it. Not like this. Can you help me? Of course I can, but... How much do you want? Money? I have money. No, I don't want anything but to help. It can only look good to the parole board. But I can't help you from in here. I have to get out. That's not going to happen, Luthor. Relax. I can get a day pass. A day pass? That's not even a thing. Wanna bet? Kaylie! Breakfast! I can't find my shoe, Mommy! Ahhh! Kaylie, what's wrong? It's good to be home. You live here? Practically. So this "Parasite" zaps your powers, now you're a filthy mortal like the rest of us. Do I have it? Something like that. I still have my abilities but they are very weak. Some more than others. It may be slow going, but you'll return to full strength. Eventually. There's no time. I need a jump start. Can you shoot me into orbit or not? I'm not launching you into space. Why not? Because you are right now a fragile egg. Untrained and unprepared for the grueling reality of space flight. Unless your secret identity is an astronaut. Didn't think so. Anyway, don't worry. I have a plan. This is from S.T.A.R. labs. How did you get this? Yup. There's your problem. The janitor... That grenade was an organic EMP, designed to absorb all the power it comes in contact with. It's almost like it melded with the janitor's DNA and turned him into some kind of energy vampire. It takes everything. How do you fight something like that? I just told you. "It takes everything." It's like buying a company, when you absorb the assets, you also absorb the vulnerabilities. If we can employ those, we can defeat it. So... what are Superman's weaknesses? I don't know. I'm not sure if I ever had any. I wasn't talking to you. Lobo. Even on the inside, I like to keep close tabs on all the happenings about town. Once the Czarnian here was liberated from the cell you put him in at S.T.A.R. Labs... Thanks fer that, by the way. it was an easy matter for one of my surrogates to track down the bounty hunter and... cut a deal. A deal? You might say I bought the company. Lobo is now my asset... ...or vulnerability. Time will tell. The ring. Carved from irradiated remains of Krypton. I don't know how or why, but it weakened me. A lot. That's what we use to fight off the superpowered Parasite. Extraordinary amount of radiation for something so minuscule. Harmless to humans, but having absorbed your powers... this might work. We just need to get its attention. Mmm, somethin' I like about this place. This plant powers the entire city. Where is everybody? I called in a bomb threat before we left. You shouldn't lie about bombs. I didn't. Looks like Lex was able to boost the output. Now we wait. Wait's over. It's ass-whoopin' time. Here we go. Feeling any stronger? Let's see. Well? Am I paying you to stand around? Yeah, yeah, don't get your panties in a twist. Hell, yeah! Whoo... Go down, damn it! The ring, it's not working. It looks like there's a limit to how long the Parasite can retain your power... and weakness. Lobo! Eat... shit... bastich... No. No. They have to hold their fire! It's only making him stronger! I'll make a call, but we need Lobo's ring. If this thing absorbs all the power from the plant, it'll become too strong to take down. Then he can't make it to the plant. What are you going to do? Give him a weakness. Hey! Want some more? I'm right here! Troupe. T-R-O... Yeah. Yeah. I'm still holding for the Pentagon. What? Are you... That's 45 minutes on hold, Lane. I was almost through! City is on lockdown. We're not allowed to leave the building. - But... - Yeah? The story is out there. Need more power? Well, come and get it! Lex! See, here's my problem. The Parasite is very powerful. But the Superman is also very powerful. Lex, no! Right now, the man with the ring is the most powerful of all. So, which is the bigger threat? A simple janitor transformed into a monster by futuristic tech? Or the super-powered alien lying to humanity masquerading as one of us? Oh, hell. I'll just make you both my slaves. Magnifying Pulse Rifle. LexCorp security issue. Pretty sweet, huh? Are you all right? But, the Parasite... I saw it kill you. You saw what I wanted it to see. Those people are in grave danger. That ring will kill you. I don't know any other way. Find one. Choppers are grounded. TV crews can't get in. Lois Lane, live at the scene. We're on foot and we have a phone, so we're live-streaming. The military have tried to keep the crowd back, but at this point, we've got a lot of angry people who are ready to make a stand against what they see as an extra-terrestrial threat. Superman may be the only thing that stands between the people of Metropolis and total annihilation. But, if the eyewitness reports are true, the Parasite can absorb our strength, knowledge, our feelings, our essence... Feelings? My essence. Rudy! Rudy Jones! I know you're still in there, Rudy. I know you remember me. And I know if you've absorbed everything about me, then you haven't just gotten just my powers or my knowledge. You've gotten my heart. My love for my family and friends. My need to keep them safe. Rudy, you are a combat veteran who served with honor. A proud father of one in first grade. Kaylie, right? And another on the way. I'm sorry this happened to you. But, whatever else you are, Rudy, whatever you've become, I know you're still the same as me. You don't really want anyone to get hurt. What are you doing? Stop! All of you! He's not the alien. I am. I see the anger in you. But, the truth is, you don't hate aliens. You're scared, terrified of them, even when they're not there. This man's name is Rudy Jones. He's the victim of a terrible accident. But, he was born here. He's one of you. And so am I. I was born in the last days of a dying planet. My parents' hope was that they had sent me to a world where I would be safe and protected. But, the price of that protection, silence about who and what I really am, while others like me face persecution, or worse... I was scared, but I'm not scared anymore. My name is Kal-El of Krypton. And I come in peace. Die, you bastard! Stop! Rudy, wait! Oh, God. You should have let me turn the damn thing off. Superman! The reactor! Rudy! Is that really you this time? Or is it a telepathic trick? I've apologized already. It bought me the time I needed to recuperate so I could save your ass. Better. But you still sound like a dweeb. You could've mentioned the immortality. I like to keep people guessing. Three aliens. The last surviving members of each of our people. Of course I killed all my peoples myself. So, why do I give a shit? Nah. Just kidding. You should have seen your face, though. You know those are just stories, right? Every rat bastard I hunt is the last of his people. Something you say to keep the bounty high. Are you saying there are other Martians out there? Hell yeah! Seen 'em myself. Might even be a Kryptonian, or two. All right, ladies. I gotta take a big old space dump and I don't do it no place but my own. So... smell you later! I really hope he doesn't come back. You should go. Follow him. Find your people. And you, Kal-El. It's Superman. My people are right here. You... You couldn't meet me over by the stairs? We're losing valuable interview time. Sorry, Ms. Lane. Not today. Call me to reschedule. Way to go, Superman! So, how was the interview, Lois? You know what I told you about power moves, Clark? Well, I was right. They really do work. Has anybody seen my calendar?
