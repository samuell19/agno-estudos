[MUSIC PLAYING] -You made good time, Yak. -How long you wait? -Oh, I got here last night. What'd you find out? -Two man gonna hold up stage, Coyote Canyon. Much money on stage. -Well, it looks like we're gonna have our hands full. -More trouble, more fun. --[LAUGHS] Well, that's one way to look at it, but there's been two sheriffs killed at Little Rock. And it's our job to find out who did it. -We [INAUDIBLE]. -Well, I reckon we better get started. Beat them [INAUDIBLE]. -Gentlemen, I've called this meeting that you may all know Al David. He's to be sworn in this afternoon as sheriff of this country. [APPLAUSE] Mr. Davis, I feel that we should acquaint you with the face that this vicinity is being terrorized by a band of outlaws ruled by a man whom they call The Shadow. He's a very clever man. Many traps have been set for him. And he always evaded them. Our cattle are stolen night after night. He has absolutely no regard for human life. Stage coaches are held up and robbed. And the drivers shot. -Well, it looks like we won't get through this time, [INAUDIBLE]. -You stay out of sight and follow me. -[INAUDIBLE]. -Don't look back. Drop that gun and keep driving. -[INAUDIBLE]. -[INAUDIBLE]. -You meet me in town. MAN: Throw down that bag. DRIVER: You're too late. A lone rider beat you to it. MAN: Yeah? [GUN FIRES] [WOMAN SCREAMS] -Hey, look boys. Something's wrong. [INAUDIBLE CHATTER] -Better get him to a doctor, boys. Quick. -Where can I find Mr. Matlock? He's my uncle. -I'll get him for you, Miss. -Thank you. -Well Miss, you had quite an exciting ride. -I certainly did. -And gentlemen-- -Matlock! Matlock! Stage was held up. Joe's dead and Dave was wounded. There's a girl on the stage claims to be your niece. She's asking for you. -So you are? -I'm Anita, Uncle Matt. -My dear, this is certainly a pleasant surprise. Tell us. What has happened? -Well, I don't know exactly. I was heading for town when I saw the run away. And I happened to be close so I caught it. This young lady can probably tell you more than I can. -Well, first we were held up by a lone rider and then shortly after two men held us up again. And they shot the guard and the driver, and then the horses ran away. And this gentleman caught them. And I'm mighty grateful, too. -And so am I. You see, Davis, it's things like this that happen every day. [GUN FIRES] -Look. See that smoke. -The bullet came straight on, but from where? That's just the way the other man was killed. -I reckon this is end of law and order. Won't nobody run for sheriff now. -If it's just the same with you folks, I'll take this job as sheriff. You say you can see the whole street? -Hmm, me hear shot. Look quick. See no one. Only smoke. -[INAUDIBLE]. -[INAUDIBLE]. -I'm sure those are the hombres that held up the stage. Wait here. [MACHINE SPINS] VOICE ON OTHER SIDE OF WALL: You needn't explain, boys. I know everything that has happened. Keep your eyes on this new sheriff. Watch every move and report to me in the morning. -Cover my trail, Yak. I'm going back to the money bags. -[INAUDIBLE]. -It's the stage bag. Do you suppose he just found it? -I don't know. But here's we get it. And him, too. -[INAUDIBLE]. Two men follow. Look through glass. -Ah, well I figured as much. Here, take my horse and meet me at the express office. Keep this money. [GUN FIRES] -It's empty. -Where did he go? -I don't know. -Look! -I know we got him. He can't get far. Come on, let's find him. -Oh, you stay here and watch. Reckon the express company will be glad to get this money back. -[INAUDIBLE]. -We trailed him and saw him pick up the money bags. Park here shot him off his horse, but we couldn't find him. VOICE ON OTHER SIDE OF WALL: He just rode in town and went into the express office, probably with the dough. This is twice you've gummed things up. Another fluke like this and you two guys keep riding. It's 10-1 he knows who followed him. So you'd better get back to the hide out and stay there till I send for you. -All right, Yak. Let's find out where they'll lead us. -The loco Frank. He'd cut a man's throat for $1.00. And [INAUDIBLE]. A lifer from Walla Walla. And there's [INAUDIBLE]. He's wanted in every state on the border. And Slippery Williams and Spike Morgan. [WHISTLES] What a nest of hornets. And Matlock's ranch only two miles away. Wonder if he knows what's near him. -Maybe we tell him. -No, it might spoil our chances of getting them. -Well my dear, what do you think of the ranch? -Oh, fine. But I haven't seen any cattle. -There are no cattle. They were all stolen several weeks ago. That's why I've tried to bring law and order to this valley. Seems useless. Three men have been mysteriously shot down. And the outlaw activity continues. -Well, can't you appeal to the government? -The ranch men have written repeatedly, but nothing has happened. -Oh, where is the foreman and your boys? -They were in with the rustlers and left with the cattle. -And you live here alone. -Yes, except for old Jake the cook. -I'm going over to Matlock's. Now you stay here and keep an eye on whoever passes. -Under the circumstances, I think we should try and dispose of this ranch, or at least let me buy your half. This is certainly no place for a woman. -Oh, I quite agree with you there, Uncle Matt. I didn't expect to find it like this. -How many for supper, Mr. Matlock? -Just the three of us, Jake. -Thank you, sir. -Oh, here comes someone, Uncle Matt. -Well, it's our new sheriff. Come right in, Mr. Travers. -How do you do? Miss Matlock. -How do you do? -Just wanted to tell you about my good luck. I found the express money near the scene of the hold up. -Well, that is good luck. Did you see any sign of the robbers? -Well, uh, I can't make any promises right now, Mr. Matlock. But I hope to have the Shadow and his gang behind the bars, in a very few days. -Well my boy, I certainly wish you luck. But I'm afraid that never can happen. The Shadow is clever. His men are the most desperate criminals ever banded together. -How do you know? -Why, uh, the cold-blooded manner in which they operate. -Oh, I see. But I still think I can do it. -Well, I certainly hope you do. Will you excuse me a moment? -I suppose you're glad to be home again, Miss Matlock. -Well, this isn't exactly my home. In fact, it's the first time I've seen the place. You see my father and Uncle Matt own this ranch. And two years ago dad was killed. I inherited his half. Uncle Matt has offered to buy me out. He says this is no place for a woman. -Oh. -He says strange things happen here at night. And there are only the three of us, old Jake, Uncle Matt, and myself. I'm almost afraid. -Hello? VOICE: Sheriff will soon be leaving Matlock's ranch. Wait for him at the crossroads. There's a girl at the ranch. No harm must come to her, but scare her away tonight. -[INAUDIBLE]. I'll have the boys attend to it. -And don't be afraid to use it. -I won't be. -Won't you stay for dinner, Mr. Travers? -No thanks, I have to be going. I'll see you in the morning. Good day, Miss Matlock. -Good bye. A fine fellow, isn't he? -Yes. It's too bad that he's Sheriff. -[INAUDIBLE]. Big fun. -You boys been a little too careless with your shooting irons. So we'll just send you up for attempted murder. -We'll be outta here by noon tomorrow. -Yeah? Well, thanks for the information. There must be a secret entrance. I distinctly heard a third voice. That's a funny place for a safe. [FOOTSTEPS] [KNOCKING ON WALL] Here it is. It's a fake safe. This must be where The Shadow gives his orders from. [BANGING SOUNDS] YAK: [INAUDIBLE]. TRAVERS: Well, this is interesting. It's a tunnel. Come on. Let's see where it leads. Well, what do you think? They've hollowed out this old stump. This is where those mysterious shots came from. Through this hole a man could cover the entire northern part of the street. We've got work to do tonight, Yak. The first thing is to find cross-cut saw. [ANIMAL SOUNDS] [SCREAMS] [GUN FIRES] [MAN SCREAMS] [GUN FIRES] -Good morning, Anita. -Good morning, Uncle Matt. -Did the disturbance bother you last night? -Oh, not a bit. In fact, I rather enjoyed it. You should've seen these so-called ghosts run when I opened fire on them. -Did you do that shooting? -I certainly did. And I intend to keep on shooting. You know Uncle Matt, I've decided not to sell. I think I'll stay right here and fight it out. -Well, I, I admire your spirit and if that's your decision, I'm with you. But you breakfast is ready. I must hurry to town. -Good bye. MATLOCK: Good bye. -Morning, Sheriff. -Morning. -The ranchers are all here as you ordered. -Good. Ask them to stay of the main street until I'm ready. I gotta surprise in store for them. -OK, Sheriff. We'll be waiting. -Come on, Yak. Let's go. Come on out, partner. Don't worry, it's empty. Yak, watch the street like I told you. Come on, get going. I'm warning you. Now do as I say or take the consequences. Now listen. VOICE ON OTHER SIDE OF WALL: You're late. What happened last night? He had men covering his trail. We couldn't get near him. VOICE ON OTHER SIDE OF WALL: Well, he's in his office now. Get him out in the middle of the street. [INAUDIBLE] At 11:00 this morning I personally will head the boys into town. [INAUDIBLE] will be under the straw that cover the wagons. We'll cover one end of the street and the boys, the other. We'll take the bank for a cleaning. You'll take your position in the stump. Get going. -Take off your hat. Put this one on. Take off that scarf. -You're not gonna send me out there, are you? -You guessed it. But I got the stump covered, so I guess you'll be all right. Get moving. Get the boys. Come on. -Come. Sheriff say keep eye on stump. -Take it easy, Parker. Don't move. [MEN YELL] -Listen up you, you got just one chance to live. Who's The Shadow? -Oh, don't shoot. I'll tell. I'll tell. It's-- [GUN FIRES] Oh! -Boys, we just missed The Shadow, but he's coming back, he and his gang. They have a machine gun and they intend to wipe out the town. What's to be done? [MEN YELL] -All right. They must never reach town. We'll surprise them and head them off. Pick up all the men you can and let every rider wear a white cloth around his head so we can distinguish ourselves from the outlaws. Get your guns and we'll all meet at [INAUDIBLE]. Men, I was sent here from Washington. I'm swearing you all as deputy marshals. Today [INAUDIBLE] United States government. Everyone raise his right hand. You solemnly swear. -It just doesn't seem possible. -But it's true, Miss Anita. The night your dad brought your uncle from the east was the night this man and his gang raided the ranch. Both your dad and uncle were killed. He took all your uncle's papers and his clothes, and passed himself off in town as Matt Matlock. The sheriff must know about this, Jake. I'm going to tell him right now. -Yak here will signal us from that mountain when they're coming. We'll let them get by us and then attack them from the rear. Now everybody scatter and stay hidden. -Are the boys ready? -Yeah. -Well, there's no time to lose. -Who's that coming? -It's that fool girl. Stop her. Take her to the hide out. Put her in the wagon, [INAUDIBLE]. I reckon the sheriff won't do much shooting with her in there. Stand ready with that machine gun. -Stand ready, men. They're coming. [GUNS FIRE] [MACHINE GUN FIRES] [GUNS FIRE] [GUNS FIRE] [ANITA SCREAMS] -All right, boys. Let's go. BOY: Daddy, daddy. Daddy, [INAUDIBLE]. -Well now, what's happened to you, young fella? -[INAUDIBLE]. [YAK SINGING NATIVE AMERICAN CHANT] -Yak and papoose have [INAUDIBLE] fun. -You'll get a lot more than [INAUDIBLE] fun if you don't leave our child alone. [MUSIC PLAYING]
