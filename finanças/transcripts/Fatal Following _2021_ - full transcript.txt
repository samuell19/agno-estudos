Hi, Heather. No, don't wait up for me. I might be a little late. I've got some last-minute things I need to take care of, And then I'll be home. Listen, Heather, we need to talk. About everything. No, no, not now. Heather, I have to go. You startled me. You really don't have to make me a sandwich every day. Well, I don't want you to go hungry, And I have no idea what kind of food they serve on campus. It's a community college So it comes out of a vending machine. Well, then, see? I do have to make you a sandwich every day. Are you sure you have to go to the class early today? I'd love to spend some time with you before you go. I... Have a meeting with my English professor. Really? Can you please take the parental controls Off the computer so I can get online? I hate having to ask you every time I do my homework. Ally, honey, how many times Are we gonna have this conversation? You know jack does not like the idea of the internet. So it's a compromise that we make. The internet is filled with scammers, People just waiting to take advantage of you. Is that... I was... Thinking about doing my term paper on Wordsworth. Did you know that this was your father's favorite poet? He had this book since he was a freshman in high school. I thought he was going to get so mad at me When I wrote my name in it. Well... He could never stay mad at you for long. I miss him. I know. Me too. Just... There was... There was nothing to even steal. I just... I don't... I don't... I was actually... Toying with the idea of majoring in English. That way I could go into teaching. Really? We always need teachers. - It's just a thought. - Ally. - No, it's stupid. - It's not stupid. You've got a lot on your plate right now. I know. Do you know that having you Was the best thing that ever happened to me? And all I want is for you to be happy. Do you know what would make me... Really happy? What? A new dress. For Mary Beth's engagement party tonight. Please, mom. Okay, let's go shopping together after class. Don't you have the... Church women's group this afternoon? Okay. Okay, but... Nothing too scandalous. Okay? It's gonna be such a lovely event tonight. And it's gonna be even more wonderful When your day comes. Have a good day, honey. Bye, mom. Bye. Well, ahoy, ladies. Be nice. Well, ally. It must be my lucky day, huh? - Hi, jack. - Oh, you're off so soon? Places to go, people to see. Hmm. Up at school, huh? Yeah. I have office hours with my English professor. Yeah. Oh, hey, you excited about tonight? Well, it's not every day that your best friend gets engaged. The first one of our group. She and Issa make the... Perfect couple. They do, don't they? I need to get going. Hey, home by 6:00, right? This is my... First attempt at a video diary. I don't even know what to say. I guess it really started After my dad died. It was little things at first. Like the internet rules. The stupid curfew. It's like they don't trust me. That's it. I'm done. I can't stay here anymore. And to hear my mom is going along with it all. I'm looking at everything differently now. I mean... None of this is normal. Right? So... Yeah, I'm ready. - Ally. - Hi. I'm so glad you finally decided to come out with me. You are going to love Wellsby. It's got like one main street, a single coffee shop. Like something from an old-timey postcard. Um... What? Do you think it's all a bit... Quick? I mean, does it have to be today? I'm not sure I'm totally ready. You reached out to me, remember? Mind troubled by doubt will never truly see. That's okay. Forget I said anything. Ally, you have two doors in front of you right now. Door number one, it's gonna lead you Right back to where you came from. Door number two, That's gonna give you complete freedom To be exactly who you need to be. What's your heart telling you to do? 'cause that's your truth. You're right. Now that it's finally happening, I... Guess I'm nervous. And I'll be with you every step of the way. Okay. You have real courage, Ally. Your phone. Really? You want a real future? We've got to start shedding ties to your past. Don't be nervous. I'm not nervous. Just be your awesome self. And remember, you're in our family now. Bridger. This is Ally. Ally, this is Bridger. Ally. Mariah cannot stop talking about you. You got a big fan there. She must have been embellishing, then. Nah, we take the truth around here very seriously. And if Mariah says you're special, Well, then, you truly must be. So... Tell me about yourself. I don't really know where to begin. Well, then, that's it, isn't it? Being right here, right now, you've already begun. You see, ally, The hardest part of any person's journey... Is taking that first step. Ally? Honey, you ready? We don't wanna be late. Ally? Hmm. Must still be shopping. She says she's from Blaine. Right. That's a little close for comfort, isn't it? She deserves a chance. She seems hesitant. The first step is always scary. She's ready. did you take all the precautions? You know I always do. I just wanna make sure that this situation Is not clouding your judgment. You let me do this? Because my judgment is impeccable. Ally's the next one. I am freaking out, ally. This is not like you. Please call me as soon as you get this. Well... It's about time. Everybody's been asking where you guys are. Where is ally? She didn't come home, jack. What do you mean? Well, where else would she have gone? - Heather! - I don't know! I shouldn't have let her go shopping by herself. I was gonna go with her, but... I went to the church group instead. Well, she must have said something. - I don't remember. - Think back. We were in the kitchen, I was making her a sandwich, Just like every other morning. Did you notice her acting any differently? No. But, jack, she wouldn't just leave me. Well... Never had to deal with a runaway before. I don't think she ran away, jack. Think something bad has happened. I just, I feel it. Something is definitely wrong. It's after midnight. So should we call the police? All right. And you've tried calling her? Of course. I must have left a dozen messages, Just, it keeps going to voicemail. But can't you, I don't know, trace her phone or something? Oh, we can try. As long as it's on, it might be pinging cell phone towers. Ah. Her number. - She's 18? - Yes. Were you two fighting before she left or... Any recent arguments that might have upset her? No, no, we don't fight. What about new friends? Boyfriends? No, she's not like that. She's very innocent. She has been spending a lot more time At the community college lately. Maybe she did meet someone. She wouldn't just leave, she would say something first. She has been taken, why can't you guys see that? Can we file a missing person's report? We can file the report, But technically she's an adult. You should consider the possibility that... She might have left on her own. I'm sorry, we can't do more. I can't believe this is happening. I would recommend talking with some of her friends. See if she said anything to them. Or if she was speaking to anyone recently That you might not know about. I was as surprised as you were when she didn't show up. I know you're ally's best friend. And sometimes best friends make promises to keep secrets. But now is not the time to keep a secret, okay? Ally could be in real danger. I truly don't know where she is. She has to come back, She's supposed to be my maid of honor. You know, ally is really important to a lot of people. So if you know something, You need to tell us, Mary Beth. Ally's always had her own ideas about things. She's been... Questioning everything a lot lately. What does that mean? Mary Beth? I promise, she didn't say anything to me about leaving. She wouldn't miss my wedding, right? Oh. I love that shirt on you. thanks for the clothes. Well, what's mine is yours. Your room, it's so, uh... Tidy. Old habits, I suppose. And one must take pride in one's work, right? I'm glad you're fitting in. Everyone has been so great. You weren't wrong when you said we're family. I feel it. Good. 'cause this is your home now. Bridger wants to see you. He's outside. You know, ally... What we do here is so important. Just like the work that you're doing is important. Well, let's start with the next phase of... Your personal journey. Letting go of your previous life And attachments. I didn't really bring anything from home with me. Oh, except a book, um... Not physical attachments. Ahh. Right. You need to say goodbye. Write down what you would say if it were the last time You were speaking to your mother. To find the truth You have to be willing to let go. What are you doing? I'm sorry. I was thinking about my mom. I miss her. I wanted to hear her voice. You know the rules. And that would be breaking them. I wasn't gonna say anything. I promise. You know what we do here, ally? Yes. And you know what we do here is truly important, right? It is. And making a phone call... Could jeopardize all of this. And you understand that, right? You're responsible for everyone here, And they're responsible for you, that's the only way this works. Have you finished your letter? I can't seem to find the right words. Well, then I'll leave you to it. I hung flyers everywhere I could think of. I went to the mall. And I asked around at the college. You've been to the college? No one saw her since Friday morning, and... I talked to her professor, And she didn't show up for their appointment. No word from the police, then, huh? Mm-mm. I mean, they traced her phone back to the college, But that was it. Now I'm beginning to think that I didn't know ally As well as I thought I did. You don't mean that, jack. Heather, this has everyone really upset. And rightfully so. I mean, what kind of family can't look after one of its own? And how can we look after one another If one of us is keeping secrets? Ally doesn't keep secrets, she's not like that. She's not. She tells me everything. Well, she used to tell me everything. I think that we need to try to understand What could have led her to leave, So that something like this never happens again. Don't you think I've been racking my brains Since the moment she left? I keep asking myself... When I was making her lunch, Did she say something that I didn't hear Or was she in distress and I didn't see it? Was there something different? Her father. She's been thinking a lot about her father lately. Well... No one can replace frank. But you two have got to learn to move on. And I thought that the community that we have here was helping. I did, too. I guess I was wrong. I don't know. Feels good, doesn't it? Mm-hmm. Like I've never felt the sun on my face before. Bridger has a way of making you see the world Like you've never seen it before. How long have you known him? He saved my life five years ago. And I mean that literally. I was in a really bad place. I was a runaway With like zero life skills. Um, one morning I woke up Penniless and homeless And about to make some really bad choices. Oh, my gosh, Mariah. Are you all right? Yeah. Bridger, um, pulled me out of the gutter. And... Gave me a new life. So now I owe this one to him. I guess he's saved all of us. And, you know, moving to a town like this wasn't easy. Can you imagine? I mean, the things people thought and said about us? But Bridger slowly won everyone over. He does have a way with words. All right, what's something you've always wanted to do? Uh... Come on, be honest. I've... Always wanted to get my ears pierced. Seriously? That's what you want to do With your new-found freedom? Okay, okay. I've always wondered what it's like to kiss a boy. Oh. You poor thing. Come on. Come on. It's time. Saying goodbye is always hard. But it has to be done. I wish I could hug her one last time. Come here. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. Center yourself. Now open your eyes. What do you see? It's beautiful. Let's go in. We shouldn't get in. It says "no swimming." I won't let you drown. Let the water wash away your past. So you can start anew. You've done all that you can do. All we can do now is just wait. But she doesn't have any money And she's never been on her own before. I think she'll come home. To her family. Do you really believe that? We should really head out now. Heather? Look. I know that this is really hard for you, but... We really need to go now. I was thinking, um... There's really no reason for you to go with me. I mean, maybe I should just go on my own. I really think that I should go with you. I want to go on my own. Heather, look. Please, j... Let me bring my daughter home. Please. Hi. I'm here to see sheriff warren. Down that way. He'll be the one with his feet up on the desk. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. I told him to move his tractor off of max's property. Come in. Yeah, well, if he doesn't, Then I'm gonna come down there and impound it myself. All right. Okay. All right. Bye-bye. Property line disputes. Bane of the small-town sheriff. How can I help you? I'm Heather Prentice. I'm ally's mom. Of course. I wasn't expecting you so soon. It wasn't a very long drive, and, um... I just want to get this over with, you know. Casey? Could you get me the box there Marked "Prentice"? Here's the box, sheriff. Terribly sorry for your loss. It's a tragedy when... Somebody we lose was so young. This is ally's. It wasn't supposed to be like this. We were making plans. She seemed just... She... She seemed so happy lately. Her father recently passed, and... And of course it was devastating, For both of us, but... Sorry. Just, she was... She was taking classes and... And she was making plans for her future. Sometimes kids have a secret inner life We know nothing about. We talked about everything. Usually when kids run away, They're running away from something. So, um... How does this work? Do I make a formal identification of her body And then you give it to me? I'm sorry, they didn't tell you? What? Your daughter's body wasn't recovered. Well, then how do you even know she's dead? She could still be alive. There was a witness to the drowning. Her friend. Uh... What's her name? Right. Mariah witnessed the event. I don't... The town tries to discourage people from... Swimming at Beldwin Creek, but kids will be kids. Apparently the girls were having a day by the river, And ally wanted to swim out. Mariah told her not to go too far. Then Mariah heard her cry out and go under. She never came back up. Well, then you need to drag the river. Well, that's the first thing we did, ma'am. We found her shoes about a mile downstream. Unfortunately there's a strong undercurrent. Once you get caught up in that, Well, it'd take you right down the Mississippi. So who's this Mariah? I'd like to speak with her. I can pass your information along to her, And, uh, I'm sure when she's ready, she'll reach out to you. Uh... This has been a very traumatic event For everyone involved and... I think it's best if we move on from here. Do you have children, sheriff? Two. Then you know what a ridiculous thing That is to say to a mother. Heather. How are you holding up? I've been better. I can imagine. But listen, we're all here and ready for you to bring her home. They couldn't recover her body, jack. Oh, Heather. Look, I am going to, uh... Stay the night here tonight and I'm... Gonna find the person who was with ally when it happened. - Are you sure? - Yeah. I really feel like I should have gone with you. No, I'm... I'm fine. I just, I need to do this for myself. And I owe it to ally. Sure that's not just the grief talking? Jack, how can I grieve if I can't see her one last time? Listen, we're all here for you and ready to mourn with you. Why don't you just come on home? Huh? Let us take care of you. Give me time, please. I need answers. I need to know why she ran away. All right, well... You do what you think is best. I'm just a phone call away, remember? Thanks. Yeah. - Hi. - Well, Mrs. Prentice, We are happy to have you at the main street b&b. And we hope you'll enjoy your short stay. Thank you. What brings you to our little hamlet? Family business. Oh, you have family here? No. Oh. Well, uh, if you need anything at all, Just let me know. Uh, I could point you to local points of interest, If that's your thing. Uh, there's a downtown walking tour. And lots of lovely walking trails In the surrounding areas. Actually, could you... Point me in the direction of a local... Uh, restaurant or bar or coffee shop, Or just any place where the locals hang out? Oh, that would be the main street cafe. And, uh, if you're looking for someone, That's where I'd start. Thank you. Breakfast at 8 a.M. Okay for you? I don't need breakfast. Oh. Suit yourself. Just let me know if you change your mind. What were you trying to tell me, ally? - Hi. - Hi. What can I get for you? Um... A coffee, please. Okay. $2.00, please. Thank you. Um, have you... Have you seen this girl? Her name's ally. Just... Just take one more look, please. It's still no. Sorry. Okay. Thanks. So... It seems like it's a... It's a pretty small town here. You probably know everybody. Um, do you know a girl named Mariah? What's the name again? Mariah? Is that Mariah? Mariah. Mariah! I'm ally's mother. I'm ally's mother. It happened so fast. Ally wanted to wade out into the river, But we didn't know the water was gonna be so strong. So, uh... When she got halfway out... Her feet got knocked from underneath her And... I tried to go after her, But... I just keep thinking There was more I could have done. That's a lot of weight to carry on your shoulders. It's not your fault. I appreciate you saying that. So... Ally never mentioned you before. Well, uh... We only recently met. I, uh, I really have to go. No, please, please. T-two minutes. So, um, where did you meet ally? Aum... Here, in this cafe. Ally was looking for a room to rent, And my roommate had just moved out. So... You were willing to just rent a room To some stranger off the street? Did you ask her how she was gonna pay the rent? Did she tell you anything about her life? You know, she didn't speak much about it. Then again, I didn't really have much time to get to know her. She must have said... Something, right? There must be some reason why she ran away. If ally didn't tell you, Maybe she didn't want you to know. Look... I'm sorry. I just don't think I have the answers That you're wanting to hear. Uh... You should go home. Oh... Did you find what you were looking for? - Not exactly. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Oh, why don't you have a seat? You look like you could use a cup of tea and a scone. Thank you, but I just want to go upstairs and rest. I won't hear of it. A cup of tea can fix anything. Something my mother used to say. You really don't have to put yourself out. Oh, no, afternoon tea's all part of the service, isn't it? Tea won't take two minutes. Are these all copies of the local paper? Oh, I keep every one them. I fancy myself sort of a local historian. Are you looking for anything in particular? Yeah. Information on, um, beldwin creek? Beautiful place for a picnic. Lots of walking trails. Great for bird watchers. Is it a popular place for kids to swim? Well, you're not supposed to swim in the creek. If the water's high, There's a chance you could get washed away. Has anyone drowned there recently? Oh, no one's drowned there in years. Too shallow this time of year, anyway. But now... There was something. When was that? No. Oh. Hmm. Here it is. The last drowning in beldwin creek. Over five years ago now. Hmm. Poor young woman. No more than a girl, really. Oops, I forgot the milk. I'll be right back with it. What did you do with my daughter? In the midst of trouble, be calm in thy heart. I strive for peace and calm at all times. But I think we might have a problem. All right. Ally's mom's in town, and she's asking questions. I did my best to throw her off, but... She seems determined. That's nothing we haven't dealt with before. No. This time is different. If you remember, I was worried about ally. You were, but we were still right to take her in. How much does she know? Outside the drowning, not much really. Did we go too far? We did what we had to do to protect our community. But... I do think ally's mom could compromise us. Let me speak with warren. I think that would be best. - Morning, ms. Prentice. - Good morning. Need directions, help finding your way out of town? Nope. I was just actually deciding If I should get a cup of coffee or not. You know, main street cafe has the best If not the only coffee in town. Yes, they do. You let me know If there's anything else we can do for you Before you head out. Sheriff. I'm curious. Why wasn't ally's death covered by the local paper? I mean, it was a drowning. That's pretty big news for such a small town. We're not the kind of town that likes to sensationalize A young woman's death. We leave that kind of muckraking to the big city papers. Well, you did it five years ago for a girl who's alive and well And living as Mariah. Let me see that. Right. That's Aliah. Poor thing. She was Mariah's twin. Another tragedy that could have been avoided If people would mind their business. Her twin? Well, she didn't say anything about that yesterday... - Mrs. Prentice. - I know, you told me to wait Till she contacted me, but I ran into her at the cafe, And she couldn't even tell me what ally was doing here. Sometimes there are no answers to a tragedy, And that's what this is. So, you found nothing suspicious about the incident? Not the fact that she drowned in a shallow lake Or the fact that the last person to see her alive Can't even tell me about ally's last days? Sheriff, I am just trying to piece together The last moments of my daughter's life. I'm sure you can appreciate that. I do. Like I said, sometimes terrible accidents happen And we don't know why they happen. But we have to have faith, some things happen for a reason And we're meant to learn from it and move on, To find the truth and need to be willing to let go. Best be moving on, Mrs. Prentice. Sunrise hill center. How can I help you? I'd like to come in and speak to someone, please. I'm sorry, but unless you have An appointment with someone here, I cannot let you in. Uh, is Mariah available? There's no one here by that name. Well, I just saw her come in not two minutes ago. You must be mistaken. Have a nice day. Well... Ally? Ally! Ally! I'm sorry, ma'am, he's not available at the moment, But I mean is there anything that I can help you with? - You can't barge in like that. - I need to talk to you. I'm sorry, sir, I tried to stop her. That's all right, Casey, I'll take care of this. You have my attention. I saw ally, she's alive. She's obviously been kidnapped. Please take a moment and calm down. I just told you my daughter's alive And you're telling me to calm down? I'm sure you saw someone that looks like your daughter. - Grief will do that. - I am not imagining this. I saw her, she is alive, and she's down the street At this place called the sunrise center. And I need you to help me find her Because they wouldn't let me in. - Sheriff, I need your help. - Mrs. Prentice! As I informed you, Your daughter is no longer with us. Now, sunrise has a reason for being, And if they didn't let you in, that's their business. Now, I don't wanna hear about you Harassing the good people of my town. - Why won't you help me? - Sheriff. I'm not interrupting, am I? You... You're the one who took my daughter. Where is she, huh? He took my daughter! Where is my daughter? I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about. I saw you, you were driving the... He was driving the van and ally was in the back. - Where is my daughter? - Look. I promise you, I didn't take your daughter. Now, I had three volunteers with me. Maybe that's what she saw. If it will put your mind at ease, Well, I can talk to the volunteers And make sure there's no trouble, But I need you to stop this. I am telling you, I saw him and I saw her. You need to arrest this man right now. Now, I've known Bridger for a long time, And I believe him when he says He doesn't know anything about ally. You know why? Because he couldn't because she's gone. Actually, I'm here because I've had some complaints about you. It's, uh, Mrs. Prentice, isn't it? Oh, you know exactly who I am. Yeah, my colleague says you've been stalking her. You've been watching our center. It's unnerving her and our volunteers. Is that true, Mrs. Prentice? This cannot be happening. He has my daughter, sheriff. Going around town and accusing innocent people Of kidnapping is a crime. Harassment is a crime. Now, if you keep this up, I'll be forced to deal with it, You understand me... I will arrest you For harassing the people of my town. I don't wanna do that to a woman in grief. Unbelievable. Heather. Jack. Ally is alive. I saw her. - What? - They took her In a van from this place called the, um... The sunrise hill center, and it's run by this guy Named Bridger. All right, well, listen, I think it's time you come home, okay? I'll come out and get you. You sound like you're in no fit state to drive. There's definitely something off about them. I'm afraid it's a cult, jack. This sounds kind of crazy, Heather. It gets worse. They wiped her phone. There are no phone numbers in there, no text messages. My phone number's not even in her phone, jack. It doesn't make any sense. And that sheriff, he is in on it, I know it. All right, well, listen, Heather, what we're gonna... There's definitely something going on here. And I am being watched. I am, jack. Okay. That place that ally came from, It's not some like little business. Like it has like these two High-tech security cameras out front. Why do you need that in a little small town like this? It doesn't make any sense. And the sheriff, he has been trying to run me out of town Ever since I got here. He even threatened to arrest me. What for? I think he's just trying to scare me. All right, um... Well, um, look. I've got a few issues I have to deal with here, But, um, I'll call you later, okay? I'm gonna find her, jack. Ah, now. Mary Beth. Um... Now then, I know that you don't wanna get yourself in trouble. And I suspect that, uh... That you wanted to protect your friend. But ally... Might still be alive. And so I need you to tell me Who she might have run away with. It might lead us to where she is. I'm not asking anymore. She told me she met someone outside the congregation. And it opened her eyes to a different kind of life. Where? Online. But I think she said she lived outside Wellsby. A name? I never knew. I'm sorry. Well... No more secrets from now on. Hmm? It's difficult to know That she would keep something like that from me. Hmm. Not share. Now, Mary Beth, You know how hurtful secrets are. They break trust. I never meant to break your trust, Issa. I'm so sorry. Oh, good afternoon, Mrs. Prentice. How are you enjoying our little town? I need to extend my stay for a few days. Oh, not ready to go back to the city. I understand. The room's yours. Um, would it be okay If I use your laptop and your internet? Oh, sure... Of course. Thank you. What would you be wanting with those folks? My daughter's missing. And you think she's at the sunrise hill center? I do. Do you know anything about them? Well, it's been around About, oh, say ten years. A young man named Bridger Runs the place. Moved here with a handful of young people And took over an old farmstead on the outskirts of town. Hmm, off route 75. Oh, they turned that place around From a dilapidated property, made it nice again. But they still have a location on main street, correct? Well, now, that's supposed to be a halfway house for runaways. Bless their souls. At least that's what they say. Bunch of new age hippies, if you ask me. Have you ever spoken with Bridger or Mariah? Oh... No. They keep to themselves. Which is probably a good thing. I wouldn't want to have anything to do with them anyway. They're, um... A pretty tightknit group. I know. I keep running into roadblocks. Well, you might find that people aren't inclined To talk to strangers in this town. Bridger has this town wrapped around his finger. The sheriff included. Those two are thick as thieves. Can't do one thing without the other knowing about it. So, I'm sorry, it's off route 75? You can't miss it. Thank you. You don't belong here. Where is ally? I meant to send that back with her things. And for that I apologize. I do not know what kind of game you are playing here, But I am not leaving without my daughter. Your daughter is not here. I don't believe you. - Really? - Really. You seem like a woman of faith. What do you believe, Heather? What? You think your pastor jack has all the answers? You think your faith and devotion will save you? It didn't save ally. You do not know what you are talking about. I know she was so desperate to get away from all of you That she left town without a word. Because you brainwashed her. I mean, look at this, what is this place? I know a lot more than you think. And I know you're trespassing. You should leave now. I'm coming back for her. Mrs. Prentice? Are you following me? I asked you nicely to leave our town, now I'm insisting. Why won't you take my daughter's abduction seriously? I could arrest you right now for breaking and entering. You realize that, right? My daughter is alive and well And being kept somewhere in this town. If you continue down this path, I will arrest you. Or you can get your things right now and go. I'll wait. Sorry to see you leave so soon. Well, I didn't exactly have a choice. Ah, I'm so sorry I had to call them. But I do hope you find your daughter. I will. I know it's hard to lose a child. But I don't want you causing any more trouble in my town. Don't come back. She's alive, jack! They're keeping her at a farmhouse outside of town. Look at this. Look. Here. Well, now, Heather, I don't know if this really proves anything. Of course it does. I found it on one of the beds. It's... How else would it have gotten there? That place, it was like a commune from the '70s. What if it's too late? What if they've already gotten to her? All right, Heather, you need to calm down. - Jack, it is a cult. - Okay? And Bridger, he is a very powerful man. And he must have something over the sheriff, Because why else would the sheriff threaten me And then cover up a kidnapping? - It doesn't make sense, jack. - I know, I'm listening. They faked her death so I wouldn't look for her, And it's not the first time that they've done this. - Look. - Well... What do you mean? So... I found an old article about another girl. And they faked her death, too. Her name is Mariah and she is alive and well, And she's a supposed witness to ally's death. It says here that her name's Aliah. Yeah, but that's just a lie that the sheriff fed me Because he said that that was her twin sister. But she is alive and well And Mariah is now recruiting for this cult, jack. They really underestimated you, didn't they? I gotta get her out, and I need your help. We'll go tomorrow morning. Look, Heather. Heather, you know how important ally is to me. Now that we know that she's alive, I won't stop at anything until we bring her home Where she belongs. Okay, 'cause I can't live without her, jack. You won't have to, Heather. You drive, please. That's it over there. Do you think she's in there? She must be. What if she doesn't want to come with us? No, she belongs with us. Maybe I should go in first by myself. Maybe she'll come quietly with me, Then you stay here and make sure the sheriff doesn't come. All right. All right. I guess it looks all clear, But I'm coming in at the first sign of trouble. Okay. Ally? Stay back. How did you find me? Honey, I would never not look for you. It's time to come home. No, I'm not going back there. - Why would you say that, ally? - Why do you think? I hate that place. Ally, these people brainwashed you. - You're not thinking clearly. - Ally, what's... Just leave me alone! I thought I told you you do not belong here. - You've got her all twisted up. - Ally is an adult. She's here by her own volition. Honey, these people brainwashed you. They did, they even faked your death. They didn't tell you that? They've lied to you. They have been lying to you about everything. - Everything, honey. - It was for your protection. And the protection of our community. To prevent this exact scenario. It's time to come home, And your home's in Blaine with us. We made a life for ourselves... No, you made a life for yourself. And I was expected to be the perfect, Obedient little daughter. And I was! I did everything you and jack And everyone else expected of me. - It wasn't like that, honey. - Yes, it was! It wasn't! I asked for one thing. One thing to be my own. Let me go to college. And then I find out that you and jack Were just biding time, That come spring you'd pull me out of college And marry me off to jack. What? You both would take the one thing away from me That was making life actually bearable. - No, honey, that is not true. - It is! - That is not true! I promise! - I heard him talking to Issa! That after Mary Beth, I'd be next, And you agreed with it! No, I would never... I promise you I would never agree to that, And he never said anything to me. I promise you, honey, you just misheard him. - We trusted jack. - No, you trusted him! And I trusted you. Honey. Jack saved us. Jack picked up the pieces of our lives And jack has always... Jack runs a cult, mom. Whether you want to believe it or not. Please, just give me one minute, please. Is it true? Were you planning on marrying my daughter? Are you questioning my leadership, Heather? You've never done that before. How could you possibly think that I would go along with that? How could you possibly think that, jack? All right, all right, I think that we need to calm down And go home and discuss this rationally, okay? Think about it, mom? When was the last time you did anything for yourself? Not for jack or the congregation. - Listen, look, ally... - ms. Prentice. - Please. - It is a cult! One that we've known about for a while now. That's ridiculous. You lead an extremist religious group, One that preys on single, vulnerable mothers. Not to mention they marry teenagers Off to men twice their age. - Look, it is not like that. - Are you serious? Listen to yourself. I have always done what's best for us. Let me ask you this. Has he cut off all outside communication? Like no internet? No outside friends? When was the last time that you spoke to anyone Outside of this group? Don't listen to her, Heather. She doesn't understand the importance of salvation. She's already corrupted ally. Ally! Ally, don't you see, these people have confused you? Your purpose is with us. Haven't I always taken care of you, Given you everything that you could ever need? - No! - Heather. Listen to your daughter. She is begging you to hear her. Not having a choice on who you want to marry? That's not right. Why can't you see what jack is doing? How many single moms with daughters does he take in? How many young girls are matched to marry older men? Those young girls have found a new purpose in their lives, Ally, and so will you! Don't you see, the outside world, it's a distraction. And it will only lead you down the path to darkness. Heather, listen to him. You are in a cult, Whether you want to believe it or not. All right, I've called the sheriff. He's on his way. We're not leaving without her. I think she can speak for herself. She's made it clear that she wants to be here. Actually, you two need to leave. You think I run some kind of cult, huh? Well, what do you call this... This community? Well, jack, this is a safe haven for kids on the run. From cults like yours. See, the difference is, she's here by choice, not by force. We would never force anyone to stay with us. We follow the true path, and they know it. True path? Would you listen to yourself? Man, you need some new material or something. And what about Mary Beth, huh? Did she get a choice of who she was gonna marry? - All right, that's enough. - I don't think so, jack. I didn't want to have to do it like this. - Whoa, jack, hey! - Jack, what are you doing? - You're coming! - Easy, put the gun down! No, jack! You had one job! One job, to prove your loyalty to me, Heather. - Jack! - And you failed. - I saw your faith wavering... - Jack. ...Just like frank's. What does this have to do with frank? That's right, he betrayed me, too. Just like you're doing right now. Heather, I have to go. You startled me. Jack. What are you doing, frank? How could you possibly think I would go along with all of this? I'm going to the FBI. Jack, wait. I should have killed him sooner. - Let her go! - Let me go! You're staying with me, whether I have to drag you Kicking and screaming. Jack, jack. The sheriff's here. You need to let her go now. You're gonna wanna drop that gun! What you're doing is wrong here. And you know that. Now, I don't want anyone here to get hurt. And I believe that you don't want that either. I don't. She means a lot to you, I can see that. But you're scaring her. And you're scaring all of us. Can't you see how terrified she is? I'm doing this for you. We often think... That we can make decisions for others Without knowing what they truly want. Hey! Why don't you put the gun down And ask her what she wants? That's enough. - We're leaving now. - No! Are you all right? You okay? When I was 13 years old, My parents agreed to marry me off To one of the founders of our religious group. I would have been his third wife. It took me two years to get out of a cult That I was born into. I was lucky to find Bridger when I did. I had zero life skills and, uh... I was one step away from falling off the face of the earth. You don't give yourself enough credit. Now I... I just wanna help people in similar situations escape. What Bridger's done here deserves all the credit. But it's not like we can advertise for it, can we? He's helped... So many kids escape... From extremist groups and dangerous cults. I mean, more than we can even count. Including my own daughter. It's true. She fell in love with a boy. They ran off together, but... Things weren't all they were cracked up to be. When we finally found her, It was Bridger that helped get through to her, Helped show her that the group was just using her. So you see, Mrs. Prentice, That's why we have to keep this place safe. We look out for each other So that they can look after the kids. I understand that now. I'm so sorry, I just... I was so lost after your dad. And jack was there And... I'd let him take over our lives. Just because it was easier. I can't believe I was so blind. It's not your fault. We all thought that it was a robbery gone wrong. I never thought he could be responsible for... I am so sorry. Will you ever forgive me? I forgive you. But I want a normal life. And to be able to do normal things. Yes, of course. Honey, you mean the world to me. What do you think about us starting over together? Yeah? I think you both have a lot of healing to do. But I do think that we can help you, too. Really? thank you. I would love that. Um, I mean... As long as it's okay with ally. Of course it is. You are not taking that with us. Why not? He's cute. Give-away pile. Now. Fine. Okay. Well, you may as well get it since we know it's for you. I'll be back later. Have fun.
