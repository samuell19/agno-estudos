Shouldn't that be in the field somewhere? Aha. Oh, that was Margaret, she, um, she found it in the caravan. It looks like a morbid mascot for what happened here two years ago. Why? What happened two years ago? I wasn't gonna tell you. Tell me what? All right, don't get hysterical, okay? But, a couple of years ago, there was, there was some murders on this farm. Murders? I don't know what to say. Do you not watch the news? Do I look like someone who watches the news? No, I guess not. So when were you going to tell me, halfway how through the season? I was hoping it wasn't gonna come up. Yeah, so you sign us up to work on this murder farm? I didn't sign us up, you found this place, and we need the jobs, we need the money. Yeah, but there's working risks, and then there's working on murder farm type of risks. It was two years ago. Yes, and Ted Bundy was 50 years ago and people are still talking about him. It was a long time ago, all right? So who was it? Who was what? The killer? I don't know. I dunno. What all did they say on the news? Did they get them? I don't know. They still might be around killing people. Well, we're in the middle of nowhere, all right? And I'm sure, if there was a killer running round, they wouldn't be opening this place in the next two weeks, would they? That's exactly what they want you to believe. You don't know this people. I only met Tina once. And I met both of them. And yeah, they're a handful, both. They're trying to move on. And what did they say about the murders? I didn't ask them. You didn't ask them? No, I didn't think it was appropriate. I, one of the victims was Tina's daughter. And over there, that's where it said that, well, they burnt him alive in there. Jesus. This just gets worse and worse. Look, you've got nothing to worry about, all right? Would it make you feel any better if you knew the details? Well, what fucking difference is it gonna make it now? There's no signal here. Tina did say she was gonna get wifi down here. But until then, you can get reception down the road. What different does it make it now? Does it? Wait. Where you going? I'm going down the road to get some signal so I can see what else you not fucking telling me. What, on your own? Not anymore. They're coming to get you, Mya. Oh my God, stop it. It's not actually funny. It is funny, though. Okay, you getting worked up over nothing. Over nothing? There's psychopaths running around killing kids, and you're saying it's nothing? Well you've got me protect you. How many fights have you been in? I'll have you know, I've been in quite a few. And how many have you won? I'm still here, aren't I? So if I come up to you with a knife, you would know exactly what you need to do? What, a maniac with a knife? Absolutely. You with a knife, I'll be as good as dead. Sorry. You're such a simpleton. Look, can we just start over? What exactly did you mean? Look, it's safe here, all right? We're in the middle of nowhere, no neighbors for miles, and definitely no more killers, all right? I'm not staying here. Well, where do you wanna stay? Nearby town, Airbnb? No, no, 'cause we're gonna just gonna waste all our money on a hotel when we can stay here for free. I don't want to be another story on the news. Oh, come on, all right? Let's finish the lights. Yeah? Then we'll go back to the lodge. I'll do a sweep and lock the doors. How safe it is? Safe, all right? We've been here for three nights, no one's been killed. And Tina and Mary, they stay on the farm. Do you really think they'd stay here if it weren't safe? - Okay. - Hm? I still don't like it, though. I know. All right, let's turn these babies on. Okay. You wait here, okay? You let me know if they come on. No. Look, you can't just leave me here after all the shit you just told me. It's all right, Mya. Okay, I'm going around the corner, yeah? Yeah, to turn the lights on. All right? Ready? Oh my God, Rob. How does it look? It looks great. Come and have a look. Rob? Don't be a dick. Rob! Rob, I swear to fucking God, if this is where you're gonna jump out and scare me? Rob, if this is one of your fucking jokes? Robert? If you seriously think you're getting laid tonight, you better pack this shit in. Are you just gonna stay there, or you gonna do something about it? Otherwise I'll have to find someone else on the camp grounds to please me. Okay, cut this shit out, I had enough. Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God, Rob, are you okay? Mya! Oh shit! Oh shit! Oh! Oh! No! There you are! - Hey. - We've been waiting for you. I was just doing a recon on the place to see what still needs attention. Come on. Where's Mya and Robert? We haven't seen them since yesterday. What the fuck are you doing? Get away from there! It's just a scarecrow. Take it down now. Whoa. Okay. Just take it down before my mother sees. Geez, it's not hurting anyone. I don't care, I want it gone. Do you not know what happened here? There was a tragedy here. And that thing, it's, it's just a bad omen. Sorry, Harriet. Just get rid of it. Burn it. I just don't wanna ever see that thing again. You gonna help me? You okay? Yeah. Sorry, I, I just? I had to see. Two priests and three psychics. And not one of them has felt anything evil. It's safe here now. Did you hear from Robert and Mya? No, I tried calling them, but there was no answer. And one of the girls told me there was a bit of a party plan, so you might wanna make a note to look into that. Do you think they found out? About Lester? Tina, let's not go there. I just don't like the thought of everyone running off scared when they find out what happened here. It's over. We killed him. I know. No one will believe it, anyway. It's over, though. Even though they didn't find the body? I mean, the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world that he didn't exist. Oh, Tina, let's not go there. But this place has to be cleansed. Two weeks. It'll be good. I mean, I know mom didn't want this place opened up to the public, but we need to do something before the council try and reclaim the land. It's been a trying couple of years. And there isn't much inheritance left on my side. I still can't believe Derek let his life insurance policy lapse. Typical men. You can't rely on them for anything important. They can't even fucking die properly. Anyway, I have a couple of errands to run, so. I'll go and see if I can find Robert and Mya. She said get rid of it. Is this gonna be okay? Don't worry about it. We'll get rid of it once we get around to cleaning out this caravan. This one looks like a bugger to clean. This can be one of yours to do. Hm. Seen worse. It's settled then? Hi, everyone. Okay, so, I want you all to be on your toes, heads held high and attentive. And smiles. This isn't going to be any ordinary glamping spot. This is going to be the best glamping location in the whole of the country. We want to attract attention of investors from all over the world. Once word spreads, this place will be on the map. You will all be the faces of Amityville Farm Glamping. Okay? Every guest is a priority, and every request has to be headed. I have faith in each one of you, please don't let me down. We have two weeks to get this place in shipshape, okay? I will be on point on all aspects, but I want each of you to take ownership of anything that you're doing. We're a family, and I want each of you to see this place as yours as well. Any questions? No? Okay, well let's get to it. And no more practical jokes. Okay? Mm-hmm? Okay, let's go. Hey, is anyone in here? Oh my God, Dylan, what the fuck are you doing? I'm sorry. Why are you so jumpy? I'm not jumpy, you're the one sneaking around when you should be working. Look, I was just trying to have a bit of fun, you didn't have to attack me. Believe me, it could've been a lot worse. Why are you even up here, I don't need this. I'm stressed enough as it is. I'm sorry. Why are you even in here, this is mom and Auntie Tina's office. I'm sorry, I didn't realize. I just thought I could help. With what? With like bills and stuff. That's not your job, your job is the grounds. Yeah, but I did all these financial things, I did a year of accountancy, remember? Ugh, Dylan, mom and Auntie Tina deal with all that. Okay. Okay. Are you hurt? You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. It's, it's just- Because of what happened before? No, I mean, yeah, kind of. It's just a lot of planning to get around, that's all. I'm not sure it's such a good idea to open so soon after everything's happened. Yeah, it needs to be. My grandmother had the best intentions for this place, and if we lose it, who knows what might happen? At least this way we can have some control over it. It just sounds like your mom and your aunt talking, not you. I guess. You never told me your side of things anyway. And I never will. Oh, look, look, it's nothing to do with you, okay? It's just, I really don't want to relive that night. And anyway, you might think I'm crazy. I won't, Harriet. You can go a little mad sometimes. Hey, I'm not mad. Well, at least you're not the one talking to psychics. No, I just think that they get a little bit of comfort from it, that's all. You know, knowing that this place is just finally clear of all evil. Hm. I do think you should talk to someone. Oh, I'm fine, Dylan. I know you're fine. I'm here if you ever need to talk, okay? Okay. Thank you. So does anyone know what happened here two years ago? - No. - No. So this place is cursed? Well, that's nothing new. This place is called Amityville after all. Yeah, but the Amityville House claim that the brother shot down their entire family 'cause they heard voices in their head. Then the locals burnt the house down because anyone that went in there apparently heard voices telling them to "Kill them, kill them all." And then the kids summer camp opened. So then what happened? So, there's this guy called Lester, and he worked on these grounds, like on the site. And he was a favorite of all the kids, they all loved him. Until, one summer, these kids just went missing. One by one they just turned up dead on the cornfields. Turns out Lester did it. He spent too long being exposed to the evil that radiate from the earth. And he heard voices it in his head, telling him he had to make a human sacrifice. And the kids summer camp never opened again. Until, about two years ago, a family came here. They wanted to reclaim and expand. But when the Amityville house got burned down, the souls got trapped inside, they'd seek refuge in anyone or anything that was nearby. So this family that came here, they got murdered, right here, on this site where we're sitting. They were terrorized, tortured. They were cut open like pigs in line at a laughter house. Christ. That's not even it. There's some survivors, but they swore never to tell the tale. Then how do you know about it then? Some of it's public knowledge. Look it up if you don't believe me. But these survivors that walked away, apparently they disposed of the killer. They said it was Lester, who'd returned to finish what he started. But then he just vanished. No one knows what happened to him. Rumor has it that he's still here now, he stalks this site, he's just waiting for fresh victims. Then he awakens, blood thirsty, ready to attack anyone that enters his territory. What happened to the survivors? That's the crazy part. They're here now, turning this place into a glamping site. Bullshit. It's not bullshit. Tina's daughter and husband died here. Ask her if you don't believe me. Well, that's enough dirty talk for one night. Come on, Simon. Let's go. But I wanna hear this. There's some real dirty talk for you in the tent. Come on. Poor guy. That wasn't true, was it? 100% Right, who's gonna help me finish this? I will. What are you thinking about? What? Were you thinking about her? Oh for God sake, Beth. I was here with you, I'm here with you. There's nobody else. I don't believe you. I saw you looking at her today. What you want me to do? Do you want me to blind myself so I don't look at anybody else? Don't talk to me about that. You've got issues. How dare you? You know, you really know how to make someone feel like shit! Yeah, and you make me out to be shit! When is this gonna end? I'm gonna get a shower, I feel dirty. Walk away. Let me take all the responsibility, again. Hello? Is someone there? Simon? Don't just stand there, Simon. Babe? Give me my towel back. Beth, is that you? Babe, you still in there? Look, I know I say some dumb shit. Babe? What the fuck? She's probably still sleeping. I reckon she made Simon do an all-nighter. Did you sense the tension between them two? I did. They need to chill. Yeah, but Margot didn't make it any easier for her, he couldn't take his eyes off her. Yeah, but Beth needs to chill. Men look, it's in their nature. It works both ways. True. Well I'm sure she'll come when she's ready. I just hope she pulls her weight, because I'm not picking up her slack all summer. Not to mention, now, there's loads of jobs to be done because Mya and Rob just sailed like that. Probably got spooked when they heard what happened here. Well, it's enough to make me rethink staying here. Check these out. Mad! Looks like Margot was telling the truth. Says here they never found him. He was suspected, but never tried. And when's that from? Okay, the article says 30 September, 1981. So that would mean he was well to his? What, 70s by now? So Margot was telling the truth. That means everything else she said was also true. Why would somebody wanna keep these? I don't know. Hello? Hello, are you two awake? Hello? Okay, I'm coming in. I know, that's a lot to take in. I don't understand how this place can still be open. It was a long time ago. But surely people need to know, isn't there some health and safety around this? You know what, it's not as if it's still ongoing. This matter is resolved. I know, but- We have gone to great lengths to make sure that this place is safe. I know what you're saying, how could we be so callous? But I assure you that we are the polar opposite of that. We wouldn't have brought you here if it wasn't safe. And we certainly wouldn't be opening it up to the public if there was any reason not to. I'm sorry I didn't tell you. But this isn't something that we wanna remember. Let alone talk about. This place has seen some really bad things. But it's over now. That's why we need to clear out all the old stuff. It can't continue to live in infamy. What this place needs is a fresh start. And we need this to be a success, to show that we can recover from adversity, grow as a community and change the past as we see it, not focus on what happened. And we need you, Lily. You. And people like you. Strong people with morals and dignity. Ready to stand up for what they believe in. Willing to do what it takes. I want you to be proud of what we accomplish here. We need each other. You need to trust me. Okay. A fresh start. Do you think we shoulda her? Maybe, yeah. She's coming. Hey, guys, you all right? - Hiya - Hiya. Where've you been? Just went in to town to go check my messages, get some supplies. You know that shit you said last night? We thought it was an urban legend. Turns out it's true. We found proof, old newspapers about child murderers. Yeah, I know it's true, I read it a few years ago. It's worse than I remember though. It really is. Yeah, but they've burned him alive, so don't worry about it. Yeah, but it said they found no body. Are you sure they didn't just torture him? No, they locked him in his work shed and burnt it down with him inside. Shed? Do you think it was in the shed we saw earlier? I dunno. It was a bit chard, but it definitely wasn't burnt down. Still standing. Yeah, probably the evil inside keeping it from going up entirely. I bet they built a new shed on top of the old one. That's like the worst place to put a new shed, on top of an old torture chamber. That's why Harriet said it was off limits. - Hm. - It's off limits? Ugh, that just makes me wanna go in even more now. I, I dunno. Ah, come on, we can go tonight. We'll just leave everything as it is. I, I, I, I don't- Oh, come on, don't be a couple of pussies. Don't you wanna see what's inside? Simon and Beth have left. They just up and left? Without saying anything? I guess. They didn't show up for work this morning, and the suitcases are gone. I don't like this. I feel like it isn't over. It has to be over. I've got this niggling at the back of my mind that something isn't right. Maybe we're the ones who are cursed, not the land. Don't talk like that. I can't help it. First Rob and Mya, and now Simon and Beth. There's no evidence to suggest that they're dead, they just didn't show up to work. That doesn't sound strange to you? Four people just up and vanished, no communication since. Yes, it's extremely strange. But when you've seen the kind of things we have, anything out of the ordinary is either not obvious enough, or suspicious as hell. I don't know what to do. Have we put the lives of everyone in danger? I don't think so. I just can't seem to shake this feeling that something bad is gonna happen. Is happening. We need to focus. When this place is up and running, then this feeling will recede. When the camp is full of people and we're preoccupied with taking care of everyone, things will get better. You'll see. I hope you're right. I just don't know what to do in the meantime to take my mind off things. Come on, let's get you out of this stuffy room and into the fresh air. Okay. Thank you. That's okay. No, I mean it. Thank you. For everything. We're sisters. I don't like this, Beth and Simon gone, and Mya and Robert. I envy them. Sometimes I just get this overwhelming feeling that I just need to get away, but I'm fucking stuck here. For who, your mom? I can't leave them. Something just doesn't feel right. They don't need you. This place is cursed, nothing can change that. If we leave, we can be rid of all this shit. I really need to tell you about what happened. I'm listening. We came here to make things right. To try and move on with our lives. You know what my family are like now, but they were a lot worse back then. Oh, I don't even know where to start. Start at the beginning. It's a lot darker than I through it would be. Yeah, we're in the country, there's no street lights. Yeah, I know, but it's pitch black out here. You used to have the balls for this. Oh, shut up, Margot, I'm here, aren't I? I don't think I can do this, girls. You can't back out now, we're already here. It's not right, we shouldn't be doing this. Ugh. Fine, go, me and Cindy will going inside. Go! You not gonna back out too, are you? Let's just get this over with. Wait. What? The shed's unlocked. I need to go tell my mom that I'm leaving. Is that really what you want? Yeah, it is. It's time I went my own way, away from all of this shit. I love my mom and my aunt, but I can't do this anymore, Dylan. Just everyday being reminded of what I've lost. I just can't do it anymore. You sure? Yeah, I am. But I need you to help me. I'll be here for you. Whatever you need. Okay. I don't like this. It's filthy in here. When was the last time they cleaned? I don't know, but the door was locked, so some one's been in here. I know they're hiding something in here. Let's just find what you're looking for and go, I don't wanna be here any longer than I have to be. Just keep your eyes open. I'm leaving. I heard what you said, but you can't leave. I can't stay here, I can feel my skin crawling, I get nightmares. We all do. But you belong here. Why? Because I'm related to you? You and mom took on this responsibility, not me. I don't want this place to define me, I want my own life. Have you spoken to your mom about this? No, she's blinkered when it comes to this place, she won't listen. There's too much history here, and there's just too much hurt. So you want me to tell her? Please, she'll listen to you. This is all very sudden. It's not. I've been thinking about it for a while, I just? I didn't know how to bring it up. Look, this just isn't my legacy. I didn't want this to be my legacy either, but it's part of me now, my responsibility. Just let them have it, they can flatten it or build something on the land. I can't, you know, I can. Well you can't, but I can. I need to leave. I understand. I just don't know how I'm gonna tell your mom. We'll talk about this later. Lily, you okay? Um, yeah, I'm sorry. It's okay. What's going on? I dunno how to say this. Um, it's Cindy and Margot, they've gone to the work shed. But why, I specifically told them not to go in there. She's so irresponsible. I'm sorry. It's not your fault. Do you know why she went in there? Yeah. They think you're hiding something in there. I told them not to go messing around where they're not wanted. That's okay. Thank you for telling me. We need to go get them. I'm sure they're fine. Before they hurt themselves. There's nothing in there to find. I hope you're right. Come on. This place if fucking huge. I don't like this. Oh my God, guys! What's going on? There's, there's a. Slowly. What happened? Where's Cindy. Cindy? He's killed Cindy. What? Is this some kind of joke? No it's not a fucking joke. It, it was like a, like a, like a scarecrow or something. A scarecrow? Yeah. Oh my God. I knew it wasn't over. Well you fucking knew about this? It can't be, we killed it. It's back, Mary. We can't hide from this any longer. Lester. The pedophile guy, from the newspaper? Now he'd be like in his 70's now. He's back, you can't deny it. Where's Dylan? Dylan? Dylan? Oh God, Aunt Tina there's blood. Oh God, it's him. It's okay. - It's okay. - Where is he? It's okay. It's okay. Why is there blood? - We'll find him. - But why isn't he here? Why was, why was the blood? - We'll find him. - What if he's not- We'll find him, let's go. We need to get out of here, okay? You're okay. What do we do know? - It's dead. - Uh, no. Of course it is, this is how it starts. Phone's dead, we can't call for help. There's a madman in a mask killing everyone. This isn't helping, Margot. Harriet, you Margot and Lily go to the end of the road, - call the police. - No. No, no, I better find Dylan. We'll find him. When you get to the end of the road and you've called the police, just keep going. We can't run away from this, this is our home. This isn't my home. Come on, Harriet, we've gotta go! But that we have to stick together. We need to finish this. We'll let Harriet and the others go. She's my daughter. Which is why we're letting her go. She can't be a part of this. She needs to live her own life, not be a victim of ours. You and I are tied to this place. I don't want to see her waste away on this campsite. This is not her fight. Is this what you want, honey? I'm sorry, mom. It's, it's okay, I just didn't know you felt this way. I understand. I didn't know how to tell you. But I can't leave. You need my help and I've gotta find Dylan. No, Tina's right, this isn't your battle. We've done this before and we'll do it again. Go. Are you sure? Yes. Go. I love you, mama. I love you too. I love you, Aunt Tina. Come on, let's go! Just stay together. Okay, just hurry! We'll find Dylan. Go! I'm so frightened, Tina. It's okay. It's okay. I won't let anything happen to you. Come on. - Can you still stand? - Shh. Fuck you! I'll fucking kill you, you fucking asshole! Hi. Hi, yes, police, please. I need to report a murder. Yes. Someone's killed my friend. What? No, this is serious. No, please, just send someone right away. I'm at the, at the Amityville Farm Campsite. Please, just hurry. I don't think they believe, but they're sending someone. Oh good. Right, can we go now? No, I've gotta go back. We're not going back! Well, I'm not just sitting here, my mother's over there. You didn't see what I saw, Harriet. Believe me, I've seen worse. Oh, come on, girls. I'm sorry, Harriet, I just, I don't wanna die out here. You're not gonna die out here. You don't know that. Look, we can just go, we can keep driving. The police can sort it out. I'm not waiting around for the police, Margot. I'll wait for the police then. What, on your own? Ah, fuck sake, have you got a plan? I'm in. Okay, come on, let's go. Okay, this is what I'm thinking; two of us goes to the front and one of us goes to the back. Okay, one of us can be a distraction while the other one gets the. Who, we? I don't like that plan, so who's gonna be on their own? I'll go round the back. No, wait. Just follow the plan. Let's take these off so we don't. Wait, I don't have a weapon or anything. It's a work shed, just grab anything you can with some weight to it. Are you ready? Come on. Fuck this. Margot! No, I'm alone. Mom! Aunt Tina, please, come on, wake up, wake up. Mom, mom, come on, wake up, we need to go. Com on, come on. Please. Please wake up. Mom, please. Mom. Aunt Tina. No. No! Wait! Ah, yes. Come on. Come on. Beth! Harriet. Harriet, wake up. Harriet, wake up, we need to get outta- I'll come back for you. Just go! Tina, wake up. Please, wake up. We have to get out of here. - Yeah. - Tina. Please, Harriet's in trouble. Tina, wake up. I can't even forgive my. Tina,please focus. My little girls is in trouble and I don't know what to do. Please? Please,. Ugh, fuck! Thank you for. Thank you. Thank you. oh God. I'm sorry. Don't, don't go. Harriet! Wait. - Wait! - Harriet, what are you doing? Stay away from him! Wait! Surprised? Dylan? Dylan, what the fuck are you doing? Oh my God. Did, did you kill all of those people? They all deserved it. You sick fuck. Oh my God. What is wrong with you? Well right now, here's this thing sticking out of my back. I don't care. I trusted you. I thought you loved me. You're a nobody, and you're gonna rot in jail for the rest of your life. Oh I'm not a nobody. You don't recognize who I am, Tina? You clueless fucking bitches. You really don't recognize who I am, do you? I'm Lester's fucking grandson. No, no. No. I could feel him, the night you burned him alive. Hear his screams, feel his pain, his anguish! Most of all, his hatred for you bitches! When he died, whatever lived in him came and it found me! And that's when they started? The voices. They were quiet, at first. Like a whisper. Over my shoulder. But day by day they grew louder and louder, and I realized what I had to do! No, no, Dylan, no. Argh! No! Go, run! Thank God you're here. I though all of you are dead! Mom! No, we're still here, but we need to go, it's Dylan. What happened to Dylan? No! It's Dylan! The scarecrow is Dylan! Dylan is Lester's grandson! What? No time, we need to go now! I've got you all right where I want you! Oh, go fuck yourself! Help her! Dylan, get off me! Dylan! Please, please, please, help me! Please die now. Let's go. Come on, it's okay. - Come on, we gotta go. - We gotta go, Tina. Oh God, come on, please come on. A few more steps. A few more steps, come on, we're almost there. Wait. We gotta get out. You fucking bitches! It's your own fault! It will never be over! Why is the sign here? Oh, I just took it down, we need to get rid of the name, mum, it's cursed. I'm just sick of looking at it, everyday just being reminded of what happened. Names aren't cursed, they can carry a legacy. And what legacy does the name Amityville carry? Well we can think about changing the name. Let's leave the sign for now and just have a talk. Okay. I just, I don't want his place to be haunted by the past. You know, just being known as that murder campsite. What happened in the past happened, and we can't change it. What we can do is focus on the future. If you decide to stay, we can do whatever it takes to make things right for you and the baby. Well, I'm not leaving. And when Aunt Tina gets out of the hospital, we'll be a proper family. Let's have some tea. Okay. Kill them, kill them, kill them. Mum, was that you? Was what me, hon? Nothing. Never mind.
