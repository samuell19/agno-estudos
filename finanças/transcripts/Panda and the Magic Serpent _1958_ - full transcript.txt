The White Serpent. Bought a serpent at the market. It must have been hard on you to be exhibited as an object. Just a little. I became good friend with the serpent. This is an old story. The adults did not like my serpent. Throw that away! But it is so pretty! The adults threatened me. This is an old story. I was forced to separate from the serpent with great pain in my heart. The adults do not love what is beautiful. My precious friend, please, don't become like them. Yes, I promise. This is an old story. Even the sun was sad to see us like this. I have a last word to say. And that word is... Goodbye. Yes, this is "Goodbye". Goodbye. This is an old story. A long time ago... A terrible hurricane, something we've never seen since centuries, appeared in the province of Hsi Hu. Would you believe me, if I told you that this hurricane is the doing of a supernatural being? Actually, this is a very strange story. But it is also a beautiful story. One spring morning... Panda and Mimi go out to practice the flute accompanied by their good master Hsu Hsien. This is when in the back of the garden appears... the young girl seen the day of the hurricane! He didn't change at all, this boy. A melody from nowhere comes to the ears of Hsu Hsien, as if resonating to his flute. Intrigued, Hsu Hsien wants to be sure... He never saw a girl this beautiful. Please wait! The melody from before came from this instrument. Everything is going as planned. Oh no, not him! What should I do? Even if he does not look like it, he is a famous buddhist monk. He hunts supernatural beings that cause trouble on earth. My crystal ball warns me of a suspicious presence in the surroundings. Spirits again. I have to do something to prevent them from doing harm. Hsu Hsien could only think of the young girl he met earlier this day. The next day, Hsu Hsien goes to search for the owner of the instrument. Hello. I'm giving this back to you. To tell you the truth, this is not mine. This is yours. Hsu Hsien. How do you know my name? Actually... He's the one who told me. How cute. What is your name? Panda. I am Hsiao Ching. Let's go. Pai Niang is waiting. Pai Niang? This is my mistress. She's really beautiful. We arrived here during a storm in the night. As to explain where we come from, I can't tell you. Follow me. Pai Niang. It must be the name of the young girl. Flattered that a beautiful stranger asked for him, he follows the servant, without forgetting to arrange himself, a natural gesture for a young boy. Him again! What's wrong? It's nothing. Just something personal. This way. Please come in. Wait here, you two. Here? We have to stay here? Hsu Hsien has arrived. And now appears before him... Yes, it is really her! How beautiful! Hsu Hsien is speechless. He can't say a word. Now, I'll excuse myself. Are you leaving already? Yes... I finally meet you again. Did you forget? Do we know each other? Don't say anything. You play this instrument wonderfully. It's only expressing my feelings for you. You... Take it back. And treasure it, Hsu Hsien. Yes. Is this a dream? Thank you. I'm really happy for them! Ah, something good to eat. Wait! This is the roof of the treasury! Panda! Mimi! Are you alright? What beautiful jewels! The stars that shine in the night Fell into my hands I will hang them to the hearts of lovers So that they shine as much as their eyes sparkle Cursed sprits! You'll have to deal with me. Thieves have penetrated the treasury to steal jewels. This is the work of spirits. I will tell you... This night... Hsu Hsien had a dream that was sweet and troubling at the same time. Pai Niang is sad. And when he wants to comfort her, she flees, turning into a butterfly. In jail! Walk! It's terrible! Hsu Hsien was arrested. Where did you find this? The girl is your accomplice? Confess! No. She is innocent. You go first. I'll keep watch. Hsu Hsien! For practising witchcraft, you're condemned to exile. I did this for his own good. One day, he'll understand. A popular festival... This is where Hsu Hsien was exiled. The sad fate of our hero contrasts the happy atmosphere of the festival. There's no trick. I want this arm. It's yours. But pay first. Ouch! It hurts but I'm still alright. Thank you. A radiant peace seems to reign in this city... Here are the bandits of the city. They're enjoying the festival, too. My pumpkins are good! They have talent too. What's this? Strange. Another successful operation. Always stay on guard. Never let the bad spirits seduce you. Especially the spirits that take the form of beautiful women, to fool you more easily. Learn to control your passion. I'll predict your future. Hurry up and store this away! Where are you, Pai Niang? Eating, sleeping. Sleeping, eating I only know how to do these, eating and sleeping. Thank you. Move. That's it? Go away! Don't just stand there! Mimi. An illusion. Hey, new one! You have to pay tribute to your elders. Yeah! He's good, this guy. Pai Niang... You sacrificed yourself for me. Thank you. Pai Niang! Maybe she is in this tower. Did I drink too much? Help! You're weird. Go away. Wait! The bad spirit came back to haunt you. Spirit? You're in danger of dying. It is a white serpent. Are you talking about Pai Niang? Poor Hsu Hsien! She completely charmed you. Something terrible is going to happen to you. Look. Hsu Hsien! Could she be the serpent I had to abandon when I was a child? It can't be true! A girl that kind... Pai Niang! Where are you? By the way... What happened to those two? While searching for their master, they arrived in this city. Look what you've done! Brother, come here. Don't provoke me, weakling. This city is not safe. Hsu Hsien! It's him! It's him! Finally! A moustache! What? So? So what? What what what? Typical example of the calm before the storm. Help us find our master. I'll do everything you want! You too? Yes. Buddha, oh Buddha, protect the poor Hsu Hsien. I can see her. I found her hideout. Pai Niang! I missed you. Hsu Hsien! It's now or never! Stay with me. Go away, cursed spirit! Venerable Hokai, why do you hate me so much? This man was so good to me. Please, understand! Go back to where you came from! Damn serpent! Hsu Hsien, you believe in my love, right? Pai Niang! Where are you? Hokai! Enough! Out of my sight! I don't have a choice anymore. We will have to fight! What will win? My love or your hate? You finally show your true nature. I won! Hsu Hsien, I did it! I saved you from the demon! This monster will never be able to transform into a woman again! Help me down. You owe me at least that. What are you waiting for? I want to see him one more time before losing my human form. Hsu Hsien! It's impossible. Oh, Hsu Hsien! Don't lose hope, Mistress. Pai Niang! My god! He can't see her like this. Hsu Hsien! I'm so sad! Don't go. She wouldn't want this. She's right. Pai Niang, now a serpent would suffer if Hsu Hsien saw her in this form. So, in a last struggle, she appears as a woman to leave this world. Why are you running away? I don't have anyone anymore! It's too late. Begone, monster. How crazy! He was so young. This is Hsu Hsien! He was kidnapped. Let's follow them... I will bury him in my temple. Let's warn Pai Niang. We have to do something. At the same time, the spirit of Pai Niang is crossing the infinite space to meet the dragon, king of supernatural beings. He lives on this reddening planet. Please let me in, Lord Dragon. Hsu Hsien's life is at stake. Help me, I beg of you! Help me save Hsu Hsien! Are you ready to pay the price? I am ready to lay down my life. Your life? You are saying something foolish! Spirits like you are immortal! In that case, I don't want to be a spirit anymore. Are you relinquishing your magic powers? For the one I love, yes. Love, you say? Humans have something we don't have. They have love! Since you're so persistent, I won't hold you back. Take this flower. It will save Hsu Hsien. Now, be gone! Disappear! Thank you, Lord Dragon. I am happy. I'm a human again. Why isn't he here? I came back to save him. Pai Niang! Hsu Hsien is at Hokai's temple. Here is the temple of Hokai. The bandits, now assistants of Panda, have to rescue the boy. This way. He's here. May your soul rest in peace. He's dead. In the meantime, Pai Niang was informed by Mimi that... Hsu Hsien! I'm giving your life back. Where does this voice come from? It's her again! Hsu Hsien! How stubborn! I'm coming to save him. After killing him? How dare you! But I'm coming to save him! Enough! Go away! This time I'll destroy you. I swear! I can't use my powers anymore. I'm a human now! You can't fool me! You'll see what I'm made of. Take a good look. Did you say something? I am a fish spirit. Look at me! Curses! Sink to the bottom of the ocean! Let's ask the catfish for help. Mister catfish... Hokai is... I know, I know. You know everything? Leave it to me. I'll provoke a great storm. Forward! What, again? Will it ever end? Are you making fun of me? I can't take it anymore. This is the flower of life. Hsu Hsien! Unbelievable! You saw, Mimi ? Extraordinary! Alright! A wave! Where am I? Panda! Mimi! I'm so glad to see you again. Me too. Me too! This is a miracle! I'm glad you're alive. Pai Niang! For my sake! The flower of life! So... Pai Niang is not a serpent spirit anymore. She went that far because she loved him. Poor children! Sea, calm down! Their lives are in danger! Catfish, calm down! I'm on your side now! It's a beautiful sunny morning. The sky has calmed down, as has the heart of our lovers, finally reunited. Panda and Mimi! Are you leaving with them? Ah, this is better! It is sad to have to part. Hsiao Ching is emotional, quite normal for her age. Don't worry about her. Look, she's with her friends. All our best wishes to both our heroes, that even in the adversity, never gave up on their love. The End
