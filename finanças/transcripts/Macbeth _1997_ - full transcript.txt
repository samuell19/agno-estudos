[intro music] [crows cawing] [swords clanging] [soldiers screams] [screams] [crowd cheering] [laughing and chanting] where shall we three meet again? In thunder, lightning or in rain? When the hurly-burly's done, When the battle's lost and won. That will be ere the set of sun. Where the place? Upon the heath. There to meet with Macbeth. Fair is foul, and foul is fair. Hover through the fog and filthy air. A foul and fairer day I have not seen. How far is it to Forres? [witch] Come. [laughs] What are these? So withered and so wild in their attire. That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth, and yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught that man may question? You seem to understand me. By each at once her chappy finger laying upon her skinny lips. You should be women. And yet your beards forbid me to interpret that you are so. Speak if you can. What are you? All hail, Macbeth. Hail to thee, thane of Glamis. All hail, Macbeth. Hail to thee, thane of Cawdor. All hail Macbeth, that shall be king hereafter. Good sir, why do you start and seem to fear things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth, are ye fantastical? or that indeed Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner, you greet with present grace and great prediction, of noble having and of royal hope, that he seems rapt withal. To me you speak not. If you can look into the seeds of time, and say which grain will grow and which will not, speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear your favors nor your hate. Hail. Hail. Hail. Lesser than Macbeth, and greater. Not so happy. Yet, much happier. Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none. So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo! Banquo and Macbeth, all hail! Stay! You imperfect speakers, tell me more. By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis, but how of Cawdor? The thane of Cawdor lives. A prosperous gentleman. And to be king stands not within the prospect of belief, no more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence you owe this strange intelligence? Or why, upon this blasted heath, you stop our way, with such prophetic greetings? Speak. I charge you. [eerie interlude] The earth hath bubbles, as the water has, and these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd? Into the air? And what seem'd corporal melted as breath on the wind. [scoffs] Would they had stay'd! [chuckles] Were such things here as we do speak about? Or have we eaten on the insane root that takes the reason prisoner? Your children shall be kings. You shall be king. And thane of Cawdor too, went it not so? To the selfsame tune and words. [crow cawing] They met me in the day of success, and I have learned by the perfect disreport they have more in them than mortal knowledge. When I burnt in desire to question them further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who all-hailed me "Thane of Cawdor", by which title before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred me to the coming on of time, with "Hail, king that shalt be!" What, can the devil speak true? This have I thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell. Glamis thou art, and Cawdor, and thou shalt be what thou art promised. Yet do I fear thy nature. It is too full o' the milk of human kindness to catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great, art not without ambition, but without the illness should attend it. That wouldst thou holily, wouldst not play false, and yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou'ldst have, great Glamis, that which cries "Thus thou must do, if thou have it, and that which rather thou dost fear to do, than wishest should be undone." Oh, hie thee hither, That I may pour my spirits in thine ear, and chastise with the valor of my tongue all that impedes thee from the golden round, which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem to have thee crown'd withal. [giggles] [knocking on door] What? Is your tidings? The king comes here tonight. [laughs] Thou'rt mad to say it. Is not thy master with him? Who, were't so, would have inform'd for preparation. So please you, it is true, our thane is coming. One of my fellows had the speed of him, who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more than would make up his message. Give him tending, he brings great news. The raven himself is hoarse that croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan. Under my battlements, come, you spirits, that tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here, and fill me from the crown to the toe top-full of direst cruelty! Make thick my blood, stop up the access and passage to remorse, that no compunctious visitings of nature shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between the effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts, and take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers, wherever in your sightless substances you wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night, and pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell, that my keen knife see not the wound it makes, nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark to cry, 'Hold, hold!' [exhales sharply] Great Glamis. [Lady Macbeth] Worthy Cawdor. Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter! Thy letters have transported me beyond this ignorant present, and I feel now the future in the instant. My dearest love, Duncan comes here tonight. And when goes hence? Tomorrow, as he purposes. O, never... shall sun that morrow see! Your face, my thane, is as a book where men may read strange matters to beguile the time, look like the time, bear welcome in your eye, your hand, your tongue. Look like the innocent flower, but be the serpent under't. Hm-hm. He that is coming must be provided for, and you shall put this night's great business into my dispatch which shall, for all our nights and days to come, give solely sovereign sway and masterdom. We will speak further. Only look up clear. To alter favor ever, is to fear. Leave all the rest to me. [birds chirping] This castle hath a pleasant seat, the air nimbly and sweetly recommends itself unto our gentle senses. This guest of summer, the temple-haunting martlet, does approve, by his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath smells wooingly here... no jutty, frieze, buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle-- Hmm. Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed, The air is delicate. [Duncan] See, see, our honour'd hostess! The love that follows us sometime is our trouble, which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you how you shall bid. God 'ild us for your pains, and thank us for your trouble. Where's the thane of Cawdor? We coursed him at the heels, and had a purpose to be his purveyor, but he rides well, and his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him to his home before us. [laughing] Fair and noble hostess, we are your guest tonight. [chuckles] Your servants ever... have theirs, themselves and what is theirs, in compt, to make their audit at your highness' pleasure, still to return your own. Give me your hand, Conduct me to mine host. we love him highly, and shall continue our graces towards him. By your leave, hostess. [Duncan] No, we will establish our estate upon our eldest, Malcolm. [man] Sweno, the Norway's king, craves composition, nor would we deign him burial of his men, till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch -ten thousand... -[Macbeth] If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twere well it were done quickly, if the assassination could trammel up the consequence, and catch with his surcease success, that but this blow might be the be-all and the end-all. But here, upon this bank and shoal of time, we'll jump the life to come. But in these cases we still have judgment here, that we but teach bloody instructions, which, being taught, return to plague the inventor. This even-handed justice commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice to our own lips. He's here in double trust. First, as I am his kinsman and his subject, strong both against the deed. Then, as his host, who should against his murderer shut the door, not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been so clear in his great office, that his virtues will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against the deep damnation of his taking-off. And pity, like a naked new-born babe, striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed upon the sightless couriers of the air, hall blow the horrid deed in every eye, that tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur to prick the sides of my intent, but only Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself and falls on the other. [Banquo] There if I grow, the harvest is your own. [Duncan] My plenteous joys, wanton in fullness, seek to hide themselves in drops of sorrow. [Ross] And, to conclude, the victory fell on us. How now! what news? He has almost supp'd. Why have you left the chamber? -Hath he ask'd for me? -Know you not he has? We will proceed no further in this business. He hath honour'd me of late, and I have bought golden opinions from all sorts of people, which would be worn now in their newest gloss, not cast aside so soon. Was the hope drunk wherein you dress'd yourself? Hath it slept since? And wakes it now, to look so green and pale on what it did so freely? From this time such I account thy love, art thou afeard to be the same in thine own act and valour as thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life, and live a coward in thine own esteem, letting "I dare not" wait upon "I would", like the poor cat i' the adage? Prithee, peace. I dare do all that may become a man, who dares do more is none. [Lady Macbeth] What beast was't then, that made you break this enterprise to me? When you durst do it, then you were a man. And, to be more than what you were, you would be so much more the man. Nor time nor place did then adhere, yet you would make both. They have made themselves, but that their fitness now does unmake you. I have given suck, and know how tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me. I would, while it was smiling in my face, have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums, and dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you have done to this. If we should fail? We fail! But screw your courage to the sticking-place, And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep, whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey soundly invite him, his two chamberlains will I with wine and wassail so convince that memory, the warder of the brain, shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason a limbic only. When in swinish sleep their drenched natures lie as in a death, what cannot you and I perform upon the unguarded Duncan? What not put upon his spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt Of our great quell? [Macbeth] Bring forth men-children only, for thy undaunted mettle should compose nothing but males. Will it not be received, when we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two of his own chamber and used their very daggers, that they have done't? Who dares receive it other, as we shall make our griefs and clamor roar upon his death? I am settled, and bend up each corporal agent to this terrible feat. Away, and mock the time with fairest show, false face must hide what the false heart doth know. How goes the night, boy? The moon is down, I have not heard the clock. And she goes down at twelve. -I take't, 'tis later, sir. -Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven, their candles are all out. Take thee that too. A heavy summons lies like lead upon me, and yet I would not sleep. Merciful powers, restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature gives way to in repose! [door opens] Give me my sword. Who's there? [Macbeth] A friend. What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed, he hath been in unusual pleasure, and sent forth great largess to your offices. This diamond he greets your wife withal, by the name of most kind hostess, and shut up in measureless content. Being unprepared, our will became the servant to defect, which else should free have wrought. [Banquo] All's well. I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters. To you they have show'd some truth. I think not of them. Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve, we would spend it in some words upon that business, if you would grant the time. At your kind'st leisure. If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis, it shall make honor for you. So I lose none in seeking to augment it, but still keep my bosom franchised and allegiance clear, I shall be counsell'd. Good repose the while! Thanks, sir. The like to you! [thunder rumbling] Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready, [thunder] She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed. [thunder roars] Is this a dagger which I see before me, the handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee. I have thee not, and yet I see thee still. Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible to feeling as to sight? Or art thou but a dagger of the mind, a false creation, proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain? I see thee yet, in form as palpable as this which now I draw. Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going, and such an instrument I was to use. Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses, or else worth all the rest. I see thee still, And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood, which was not so before. There's no such thing. It is the bloody business which informs thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld, Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse the curtain'd sleep, witchcraft celebrates Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder, alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf, whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace. With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design, moves like... a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth, hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear thy very stones prate of my whereabout, and take the present horror from the time which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives, words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives. [bell rings] [inhales] I go. And it is done, the bell invites me. Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell that summons thee to heaven or to hell. [rolling thunder] [panting] [laughs] That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold, [laughs] What hath quench'd them hath given me fire. [owl hoots] Hark! Peace! It was the owl that screeched, the fatal bellman, which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it, the doors are open, and the surfeited grooms do mock their charge with snores. [ominous music] [Duncan snoring] [witch] Sleep no more. [Lady Macbeth shrieks] [Macbeth] Who's there? what, ho! Alack, I am afraid they have awaked and 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready, he could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled my father as he slept, I had done't. [footsteps approaching] My husband! [breathing heavily] I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise? I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry. Did not you speak? -When? -Now. -As I descended? -Aye. Hark! Who lies i' the second chamber? [Lady Macbeth] Donalbain. This is a sorry sight. A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight. There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried, "Murder!" That they did wake each other. I stood and heard them. But they did say their prayers, and address'd them again to sleep. There are two lodged together. One cried "God bless us!" "Amen" the other, as they had seen me with these hangman's hands. Listening their fear, I could not say, "Amen" when they did say, "God bless us!" [Lady Macbeth] Consider it not so deeply. But wherefore could not I say, "Amen"? I had most need of blessing, and "Amen" stuck in my throat. These deeds must not be thought after these ways, so, it will make us mad. [Macbeth] Methought I heard a voice cry, "Sleep no more! Macbeth has murder'd sleep." The innocent sleep, sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care, the death of each day's life, sore labor's bath, balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course, chief nourisher in life's feast. What do you mean? Still it cried, "Sleep no more!" "Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor shall sleep no more. Macbeth shall sleep no more." Who was it that thus cried? Huh? Why, worthy thane, you do unbend your manly strength, to think so brainsickly of things. Go get some water, and wash this filthy witness from your hands. Why did you bring these daggers from the place? They must lie there. Go, carry them! And smear the sleepy grooms with blood. I'll go no more. I am afraid to think what I have done. To look on't again I dare not. Infirm of purpose! \N Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead are but as pictures. 'Tis the eye of childhood that fears a painted devil. If he do bleed, I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal, for it must seem their guilt. [thunder rolling] [both scream] Whence is that knocking? How is't with me, when every noise appalls me? What hands are here? \N Ha! They pluck out mine eyes. Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood clean from my hand? No. This my hand will rather the multitudinous seas in incarnadine, making the green one... red. [panting] My hands are of your color, yet I shame to wear a heart so white. [knocking on door] [breathing heavily] [chuckles] I hear a knocking at the south entry. Retire we to our chamber? A little water clears us of this deed. How easy is it, then! Your constancy hath left you unattended. [knocking on door] Hark! more knocking. Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us and show us to be watchers. Be not lost so poorly in your thoughts. To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself. [knocking continues] Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst! [knocking] [groans] [groans] [porter] Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter, sir. Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed, that you do lie so late? 'Faith sir, we were carousing till the second cock, and drink, sir, is a great provoker of three things. What three things does drink especially provoke? [porter] Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes, it provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance. therefore, much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery, it makes him, and it mars him. It sets him on, and it takes him off, it persuades him, and disheartens him, makes him stand to, and not stand to. In conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him. I believe drink gave thee the lie last night. That it did, sir, i' the very throat on me, but I requited him for his lie, and, I think, being too strong for him, though he took up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast him. Is thy master stirring? Our knocking has awaked him. Here he comes. [Macduff] Good morrow, noble sir. Good morrow, both. Is the king stirring, worthy thane? Not yet. He did command me to call timely on him. I have almost slipp'd the hour. I'll bring you to him. I know this is a joyful trouble to you, but yet 'tis one. The labor we delight in physics pain. This is the door. I'll make so bold to call, for 'tis my limited service. Goes the king hence to-day? He does, he did appoint so. The night has been unruly. Where we slept, our chimneys were blown down. And, as they say, lamentings heard i' the air, strange screams and... O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee! Some say the earth was feverous and did shake. 'Twas a rough night. My young remembrance cannot parallel a fellow to it. [Lennox] What's the matter? Confusion now hath made his masterpiece! Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope the Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence the life o' the building! What is 't you say? The life? Mean you his majesty? Approach the chamber and destroy your sight with a new Gorgon. Do not bid me speak. See, and then speak yourselves. Awake, awake! Ring the alarum-bell. Murder and treason! Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! Awake! Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit, and look on death itself! Up, up, and see the great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo! As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites to countenance this horror! Ring the bell! What's the business, that such a hideous trumpet calls to parley the sleepers of the house? Speak! Speak! [Macduff] O gentle lady, 'tis not for you to hear what I can speak. The repetition in a woman's ear, would murder as it fell. O Banquo, Banquo, our royal master 's murder'd! What, in our house? Too cruel anywhere. Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself and say it is not so. Had I but died an hour before this chance, I had lived a blessed time. For, from this instant, there 's nothing serious in mortality. All is but toys, renown and grace is dead. The wine of life is drawn and the mere lees is left this vault... to brag of. [Donalbain] What is amiss? [Macbeth] You are, and do not know't. The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood is stopp'd. The very source of it is stopp'd. [Macduff] Your royal father 's murder'd. O, by whom? Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't. Their hands and faces were an badged with blood, so were their daggers, which, unwiped, we found upon their pillows. They stared, and were distracted, no man's life was to be trusted with them. O, yet I do repent me of my fury, that I did kill them. Wherefore did you so? Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious, loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man! The expedition my violent love outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan, his silver skin laced with his golden blood. And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature, for ruin's wasteful entrance. There, the murderers, steep'd in the colors of their trade, their daggers unmannerly breech'd with gore who could refrain, that had a heart to love, and in that heart, courage to make's love known? Ho, help me hence! Why do we hold our tongues, that most may claim this argument for ours? What should be spoken here, where our fate, hid in an auger-hole, may rush, and seize us? Let's away, our tears are not yet brew'd. Nor our strong sorrow upon the foot of motion. Look to the lady. And when we have our naked frailties hid, that suffer in exposure, let us meet, and question this most bloody piece of work, to know it further. Fears and scruples shake us, In the great hand of God I stand, and thence against the undivulged pretense I fight of treasonous malice. -[Macduff] And so do I. -[all] So all. [Macbeth] Let's briefly put on manly readiness, and meet i' the hall together. [all] Well contented. What will you do? Let's not consort with them. To show an unfelt sorrow is an office which the false man does easy. I'll to England. To Ireland, I. Our separated fortune shall keep us both the safer, where we are, there's daggers in men's smiles, the near in blood, the nearer bloody. [Malcolm] This murderous shaft that's shot hath not yet lighted, and our safest way is to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse. And let us not be dainty of leave-taking, but shift away, there's warrant in that theft which steals itself, when there's no mercy left. How goes the world, sir, now? Why, see you not? Is't known who did this more than bloody deed? Those that Macbeth hath slain. Alas, the day! What good could they pretend? They were suborn'd. Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons, are stol'n away and fled, which puts upon them suspicion of the deed. [scoffs] 'Gainst nature still! Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up thine own life's means! Then 'tis most like the sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth. He is already named, and gone to Scone to be invested. Where is Duncan's body? Carried to Colmekill, the sacred storehouse of his predecessors, and guardian of their bones. Will you to Scone? No, cousin, I'll to Fife. Well, I will thither. Well, may you see things well done there. Adieu! Lest our old robes sit easier than our new! [Macduff] Your royal father's murder'd. O, by whom? [bell ringing] [Banquo] Thou hast it now, king, Cawdor, Glamis, all, as the weird women promised. And, I fear, thou play'dst most foully for't. Yet it was said, it should not stand in thy posterity, But that myself should be the root and father of many kings . If there come truth from them, as upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine... Why, by the verities on thee made good, may they not be my oracles as well, and set me up in hope? Here's our chief guest. Had he been forgotten, it had been as a gap in our great feast, and all-thing unbecoming. [Macbeth] To-night we hold a solemn supper sir, and I'll request your presence. Let your highness command upon me, to the which my duties are with a most indissoluble tie forever knit. Ride you this afternoon? Aye, my good lord. We should have else desired your good advice, which still hath been both grave and prosperous in this day's council, but we'll take to-morrow. Is't far you ride? As far, my lord, as will fill up the time 'twixt this and supper, go not my horse the better, I must become a borrower of the night for a dark hour or twain. Fail not our feast. My lord, I will not. We hear our bloody cousins are bestow'd in England and Ireland, not confessing their cruel parricide, filling their hearers with strange invention. But of that to-morrow, when therewithal we shall have cause of state craving us jointly. Hie thee to horse. Adieu, till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you? Aye, my good lord. Our time does call upon's. I wish your horses swift and sure of foot, and so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell. Let every man be master of his time till seven at night, to make society the sweeter welcome, we will keep our self till supper-time, alone. While then, God be with you! Sirrah, a word with you. Attend those men our pleasure? They are, my lord, without the palace gate. Bring them before us. To be thus is nothing, but to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo stick deep, and in his royalty of nature reigns that which would be fear'd. 'Tis much he dares. And, to that dauntless temper of his mind, he hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour to act in safety. There is none but he whose being I do fear. And under him my genius is rebuked, as it is said Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters when first they put the name of king upon me, and bade them speak to him. Then, prophet-like, hey hail'd him father to a line of kings. Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown, and put a barren scepter in my grip. Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand, No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so, for Banquo's issue have I filed my mind, for them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd, put rancors in the vessel of my peace Only for them. And mine eternal jewel given to the common enemy of man, to make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings! Rather than so, come fate into the list. and champion me to the utterance! Who's there? Now go to the door, and stay there till we call. Is Banquo gone from court? Aye, madam, but returns again to-night. Say to the king, I would attend his leisure... for a few words Madam, I will. How now, my lord! Why do you keep alone? Things without all remedy should be without regard, what's done is done. We have scorch'd the snake, not kill'd it. She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice remains in danger of her former tooth. But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer. Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep in the affliction of these terrible dreams that shake us nightly. Better be with the dead, whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace, than on the torture of the mind to lie in restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave. After life's fitful fever he sleeps well, treason has done his worst. Nor steel, nor poison, malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing can touch him further. Come on. Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks, be bright and jovial among your guests to-night. So shall I, love. And so, I pray, be you. Let your remembrance apply to Banquo. Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue. You must leave this. O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife! Thou know'st that Banquo and his Fleance lives. But in them nature's copy's not eterne. There's comfort yet. They are assailable. What's to be done? Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night, scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day, And with thy bloody and invisible hand, cancel and tear to pieces that great bond which keeps me pale! Light thickens. And the crow makes wing to the rooky wood. Good things of day begin to droop and drowse, while night's black agents to their preys do rouse. Thou marvell'st at my words, but hold thee still. Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill. So, prithee, go with me. But who did bid thee join with us? Macbeth. He needs not our mistrust since he delivers our offices and what we have to do. Then stand with us. Give us a light there, ho! There will be rain tonight. [First Murderer shouts] Let it come down! [Banquo] Treachery! [dramatic music] [fighting sounds] [horse neighs] [Banquo] Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly! [Banquo] Fly, fly, fly! [Banquo] Thou mayst revenge. [dramatic music builds] [shouting] O slave! [dramatic music peaks] [crowd sounds] You know your own degrees, sit down. At first and last the hearty welcome. Thanks to your majesty. Ourself will mingle with society and play the humble host. [lords laugh] Our hostess keeps her state. But in best time we will require her welcome. Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends. For my heart speaks they are welcome. [Macbeth] See, they encounter thee with their hearts' welcome. Both sides are even. Here I'll sit in the midst. Be large in mirth. Anon we'll drink a measure the table round. [lords chatter] There's blood upon thy face. 'Tis Banquo's then. 'Tis better thee without than he within. Is he dispatched? My lord, his throat is cut, that I did for him. Thou art the best of the cut-throats. Yet he's good that did the like for Fleance. [Macbeth] If thou didst it. Thou art the nonpareil. Most royal sir... Fleance escaped. [internal monologue] Then comes my fit again. I had else been perfect. Whole as the marble, founded as the rock. As broad and general as the casing air. But now I am cabined, cribbed, confined, bound in to saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe? [First Murderer] Ay, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bides. With twenty trenched gashes on his head. The least a death to nature. Thanks for that. Get thee gone. Tomorrow we'll hear, ourselves, again. [crowd chatter] [Lady Macbeth] My royal lord, you do not give the cheer. the feast is sold that is not often vouched. While 'tis a-making, 'tis given with welcome. to feast were best at home; From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony. [Lady Macbeth] Meeting were bare without it. Sweet remembrancer! Now, good digestion wait on appetite. And health on both! [Lennox] May it please your highness sit. Here had we now our country's honor roofed, Were the graced person of our Banquo present. Who may I rather challenge for unkindness than pity for mischance! His absence, sir, lays blame upon his promise. Please it your highness to grace us with your royal company. The table's full. [Lennox] Here is a place reserved, sir. -Where? -Here, my good lord. [dramatic beats] [dramatic music builds] [haunting music] Which of you have done this? What, my good lord? Thou canst not say I did it. Never shake thy gory locks at me! [Ross] Gentlemen, rise. His highness is not well. [Lady Macbeth] Sit, worthy friends. [stammers] My lord is often thus. And hath been from his youth. [Lady Macbeth] Pray you, keep seat. The fit is momentary. Upon a thought he will again be well. If much you note him... You shall offend him and extend his passion. Feed, and regard him not. [gasps] -[Lady Macbeth] Are you a man? -Ay, and a bold one. That dare look on that which might appall the devil. [Lady Macbeth] O proper stuff! This is the very painting of your fear. This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said led you to Duncan. [breathing heavily] [Lady Macbeth] O, these flaws and starts. Impostors to true fear, would well become a woman's story at a winter's fire authorized by her grandam. Shame itself! Why do you make such faces? [sobbing] When all's done, you look but on a stool. Prithee, see there! Behold! Look! Lo! How say you? Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too. [Macbeth breathing heavily] If charnel-houses and our graves must send those that we bury back. Our monuments shall be the maws of kites. Quite unmanned in folly? If I stand here, I saw him. Fie, for shame! [heavy breathing] The times have been, that, when the brains were out the man would die. And there an end, but now they rise again. Twenty mortal murders on their crowns and push us from our stools. [Lady Macbeth] My worthy lord... Your noble friends do lack you. I do forget. Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends. I have a strange infirmity, which is... Nothing, to those that know me. Come... Love and health to all, Then I'll sit down. Give me a drink. Fill full. I drink to the general joy of the whole table. And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss. Would he were here! To all, and him, we thirst. And all to all. Our duties, and the pledge. [dramatic beat] [Macbeth] Avaunt! And quit my sight! Let the earth hide thee! [Macbeth] Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold. Thou hast no speculation in those eyes which thou dost glare with! [suspenseful music] Think of this, good peers, but as a thing of custom. 'Tis no other. Only it spoils the pleasure of the time. What man dare, I dare. Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear. The armed rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger. Take any shape but that... And my firm nerves shall never tremble. Or be alive again. And dare me to the desert with thy sword. If trembling I inhabit then... [Macbeth] Protest me the baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow! Unreal mockery, hence! I am a man again. Pray you, sit still. You have displaced the mirth. [Lady Macbeth] Broke the good meeting. With a most admired disorder. [Macbeth] Can such things be... And overcome us like a summer's cloud without our special... Wonder? You make me strange. Even to the disposition that I owe. When now I think you can behold such sights. And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks. When mine is blanched with fear. What sights, my lord? [Lady Macbeth] I pray you, speak not. He grows worse and worse. Question enrages him. At once, good night. Stand not upon the order of your going, but go at once. Good night, and better health attend his majesty! It will have blood, they say. Blood will have blood. Stones have been known to move and trees to speak. Augurs and understood relations have by maggot-pies and choughs and rooks... brought forth the secretest man of blood. [soft music playing] What is the night? Almost at odds with morning, which is which. How sayest thou, that Macduff denies his person at our great bidding? Did you send to him, sir? I hear it by the way. But I will send. [Macbeth] There's not a one of them... but in his house I keep a servant fee'd. I will tomorrow, and betimes I will... To the weird sisters. More shall they speak. For now I am bent to know, by the worst means... The worst. For mine own good, all causes shall give way. For I am in blood stepped in so far that, should I wade no more. Returning were as tedious as go o'er. [Macbeth] Strange things I have in head... That will to hand. Which must be acted ere they may be scanned. You lack the season of all natures... [Lady Macbeth] Sleep. Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse is the initiate fear... That wants hard use. We are yet but young in deed. [first witch] Thrice the brinded cat hath mewed. Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined. Harpier cries "'Tis time, 'tis time." Round about the cauldron go. In... The poisoned entrails throw. Toad. That under cold stone days and nights has thirty-one. Poisoned venom sleeping got. Boil thou first... In the charmed pot. [all three witches] Double, double toil and trouble. Fire burn, and cauldron bubble. [water bubbling] Fillet of a fenny snake. In the cauldron boil and bake. Eye of newt. Toe of frog. Wool of bat and tongue of dog. Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting. Lizard's leg and owlet's wing. For a charm of powerful trouble. Like a hell-broth boil and bubble. [all three witches] Double, double toil and trouble Fire burn and cauldron bubble. [second witch sighs] Scale of dragon. Tooth of wolf. Witches' mummy. Maw and gulf of the ravined salt-sea shark. Root of hemlock digged in the dark. Liver of blaspheming Jew. Gall of goat... And slips of yew. Silvered in the moon's eclipse. Nose of Turk. And Tartar's lips. [witches gasp and laugh] Finger of birth-strangled babe ditch-delivered by a drab. Make the gruel thick and slab. Add hereto a tiger's chaudron. [second witch shrieks] For the ingredients of our cauldron. Double, double toil and trouble. [all three witches] Fire burn and cauldron bubble. [witches clapping] [ominous music] [water bubbling] Cool it with a baboon's blood. Then the charm is firm and good. By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes. [second witch] Open, locks, whoever knocks! How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags! What is't you do? [second witch] A deed without a name. I conjure you, by that which you profess. Howe'er you come to know it, answer me. [Macbeth] Though you untie the winds. Let them fight against the churches. [shouting] Answer me to what I ask you. [first witch] Speak. -[second witch] Demand. -[third witch] We'll answer. [first witch] Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths or from our masters? Call 'em. Let me see 'em. Pour in sow's blood that hath eaten her nine farrow. Grease that's sweaten from the murderer's gibbet... Throw into the flame. [all three witches] Come, high or low. Thyself and office deftly show! Tell me, thou unknown power. He knows thy thought. Hear his speech, but say thou nought. [first apparition] Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! Beware Macduff. Beware the thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough. [first witch] Here's another... More potent than the first. [second apparition] Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! Be bloody, bold, and resolute. Laugh to scorn the power of man. For none of woman born shall harm Macbeth. [third apparition] Be lion-mettled, proud. and take no care who chafes, who frets or where conspirers are. Macbeth shall never vanquished be until Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill Shall come against-- [witches] Seek to know no more. I will be satisfied. Deny me this and an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know! -[first witch] Show! -[second witch] Show! -[third witch] Show! -[all three] Show his eyes. And grieve his heart. [all three witches] Come like shadows, so depart! [roaring transition] [Macbeth] Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo. Down! Thy crown does sear mine eyelids. And thy hair... Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first. A third is like the former. Filthy hags! Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes! What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom? Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more. And yet the eighth appears who bears a glass which shows me many more. and some I see that two-fold balls and treble scepters carry. Horrible sight! Now, I see, 'tis true. For the blood-boltered Banquo smiles upon me and points at them for his. What, is this so? [thunderous transition] Ay, sir, all this is so. Why stands Macbeth thus amazedly? Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites. [first witch] And show the best of our delights. That this great king may truly say our duties did his welcome pay. Where are they? Gone? Who was it came by? 'Tis two or three, my lord, bring you word Macduff is fled to England. Fled to England! Ay, my good lord. [Macbeth internal monologue] Time... thou anticipates my dread exploits. The flighty purpose never is o'ertook unless the deed go with it. From this moment the very firstlings of my heart shall be the firstlings of my hand. And even now, to crown my thoughts with acts be it thought and done. The castle of Macduff I will surprise. Seize upon Fife give to the edge o' the sword his wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls that trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;. This deed I'll do before this purpose cool. [dog barking] [Lady Macduff] What had he done to make him fly the land? You must have patience, madam. [Lady Macduff] He had none. His flight was madness. When our actions do not, our fears do make us traitors. You know not Whether it was his wisdom or his fear. [Lady Macduff] Wisdom? To leave his wife... To leave his babes? His mansion and his titles in a place from whence himself does fly? He loves us not. He wants the natural touch. For the poor wren, the most diminutive of birds, will fight. Her young ones in her nest, against the owl. All is the fear and nothing is the love. As little is the wisdom, when the flight so runs against all reason. My dearest coz, I pray you, school yourself. but for your husband, he is noble, wise, judicious. And best knows the fits o' the season. I dare not speak much further. But cruel are the times when we are traitors and do not know ourselves. When we hold rumor from what we fear. Yet know not what we fear. But float upon a wild and violent sea each way and move I take my leave of you. Shall not be long but I'll be here again. Things at the worst will cease. Or else climb upward to what they were before. My pretty cousin... Blessing upon you! Fathered he is, and yet he's fatherless. I am so much a fool, should I stay longer. It would be my disgrace and your discomfort. I take my leave at once. [flute music] Was my father a traitor, mother? Ay, that he was. What is a traitor? Why, one that swears and... Lies. And be all traitors that do so? Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged. And must they all be hanged that swear and lie? Every one. Who must hang them? Why, the... honest men. Then the liars and swearers are fools. For there are liars and swearers enough to beat the honest men and hang up them. Now, God help thee, poor monkey! But how wilt thou do for a father? [flute music] Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known Though in your state of honor I am perfect. I doubt some danger does approach you nearly. If you will take a homely man's advice, be not found here. [messenger] Hence, with your little ones. Heaven preserve you! I dare abide no longer. Whither should I fly? I have done no harm. I remember now... I am in this earthly world. Where to do harm is often laudable. To do good sometime accounted dangerous folly. Why then, alas, do I put up this womanly defense to say I have done no harm? [dramatic music] [music intensifies] Where is your husband? I hope, in no place so unsanctified Where such as thou mayst find him. [dramatic flute music] [Lady Macduff screaming] [wind howls] [thunder rumbling] [sighs] I have two nights watched with you but can perceive no truth in your report. [sighs] When was it she last walked? Since his majesty went into the field I have seen her rise from her bed... throw her night-gown upon her, unlock her closet take forth paper, fold it write upon it, read it, afterwards seal it and again return to bed. Yet all this while in a most fast sleep. A great perturbation in nature. To receive at once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching! [sighing] In this slumbery agitation besides her walking and other actual performances. What, at any time, have you heard her say? That, sir, which I will not report after her. You may to me. And 'tis most meet you should. Neither to you nor any one having no witness to confirm my speech. [gentlewoman] Lo you, here she comes! [gentlewoman] This is her very guise. [gentlewoman] Upon my life, fast asleep. [gentlewoman] Observe her, stand close. How came she by that light? [gentlewoman] Why, it stood by her. She has it by her continually, 'tis her command. You see, her eyes are open. [gentlewoman] Ay, but their sense is shut. What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands. [gentlewoman] It is an accustomed action with her to seem thus washing her hands. I have seen her continue in this a quarter of an hour. [Lady Macbeth] Yet here's a spot. [doctor] She speaks. I will set down what comes from her. To satisfy my remembrance more strong. Out, damned spot! Out, I say! [tuts] One... Two... Why, then, 'tis time to do it. Hell is murky! Fie, my lord, fie! A soldier, and afeard? What need we fear who knows it when none can call our power to account? [moans] But who would have thought the old man... To have had so much blood in him. Do you mark that? What, will these hands ne'er be clean? No more of that, my lord, no more o' that! You mar all with this starting. Go to! You have known what you should not. She has spoke what she should not I am sure of that. Heaven knows what she has known. [sniffs hands] [tuts] Here's the smell of blood again. [sighs] [sighs and tuts] Oh! [breathing heavily] All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. What a sigh is there! I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body. Well, well, well. Pray God it be, sir. [gasps from fright] Oh. Wash your hands... Put on your nightgown... Look not so pale. I tell you yet again. Banquo's buried... And he cannot come out on's grave. Even so? To bed, to bed! Will she go now to bed? [gentlewoman] Directly. [doctor] Foul whisperings are abroad. Unnatural deeds do breed unnatural troubles. Infected minds to their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets. More has she need the divine than the physician. [doctor] Oh God, God forgive us all! Look after her. -Good night. -Good night, good doctor. [suspenseful music] Cousins. I hope the days are near at hand that chambers will be safe. We doubt it nothing. What wood is this before us? [Menteith] The wood of Birnam. Let every soldier hew him down a bough and bear't before him. Thereby shall we shadow the numbers of our host and make discovery err in report of us. [soldier] It shall be done. We learn no other but the confident tyrant Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure our setting down before it. 'Tis his main hope. For where there is advantage to be given both more and less have given him the revolt. And none serve with him but constrained things whose hearts are absent too. Let our just censures attend the true event and put we on industrious soldiership. The time approaches that will with due decision make us know what we shall say we have and what we owe. Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate But certain issue strokes must arbitrate. Towards which advance the war! [war drums] [drumming continues] [crowd noises] [sounds of men digging and shouting] [Macbeth] Bring me no more reports! Let them fly all. Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm? Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know all mortal consequence have pronounced me thus. 'Fear not, Macbeth, no man that's born of woman shall e'er have power upon thee.' Then fly, false thanes. And mingle with the English epicures. The mind I sway by and the heart I bear shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear. The devil damn thee black. Thou cream-faced loon! Where got'st thou that goose look? -There is ten thousand-- -Geese, villain! -Soldiers, sir. -Go prick thy face. And over-red thy fear, thou lily-livered boy. What soldiers, patch? Death of thy soul! Those linen cheeks of thine are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face? [servant] The English force, so please you. Take thy face hence. [Macbeth] Seyton! I am sick at heart when I behold. Seyton, I say! This push Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now. I have lived long enough. My way of life is fallen into the sear. The yellow leaf. And that which should accompany old age, as... honor. Love. Obedience, troops of friends, I must not look to have. But, in their stead. Curses. Not loud but deep. Mouth-honor. Breath, which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not. Seyton! What is your gracious pleasure? What news more? All is confirmed, my lord, which was reported. I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hacked. Give me mine armor. 'Tis not needed yet. I'll put it on. Send out more horses, skirr the country round. Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armor. [Macbeth] How does thy patient, doctor? Not so sick, my lord as she is troubled with thick coming fancies that keep her from her rest. Cure her of that. Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased? Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow. Raze out the written troubles of the brain and with some sweet oblivious antidote cleanse the stuffed bosom of that perilous stuff which weighs upon the heart? Therein the patient must minister to himself. Throw physic to the dogs, I'll none of it. Come, put mine armor on. Give me my staff. Seyton, send out. Doctor, the thanes fly from me. Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor... Cast the water of my land, find her disease. And purge it to a sound and pristine health. I would applaud thee to the very echo that should applaud again. Pull it off, I say. What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug would scour these English hence? Hear'st thou of them? Ay, my good lord. Your royal preparation makes us hear something. Bring it after me. I will not be afraid of death and bane. Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane. Were I from Dunsinane away and clear. Profit again should hardly draw me here. English power is near led on by Malcolm. His uncle Siward and the good Macduff. Revenges burn in them. For their dear causes would to the bleeding and the grim alarm excite the mortified man. Near Birnam wood shall we meet them that way are they coming. Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother? For certain, sir, he is not. I have a file of all the gentry. Siward's son is there, and many unrough youths that even now protest their first of manhood. What does the tyrant? Great Dunsinane is strongly fortified. Some say he's mad. Others that lesser hate him do call it valiant fury. But, for certain he cannot buckle his distempered cause Within the belt of rule. March we on to give obedience where 'tis truly owed. Meet we the medicine of a sickly weal. And with him pour we in our country's purge each drop of us. Or so much as it needs to dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds. Make we our march towards Birnam. [somber violin] Nought's had. All's spent. Where our desire is got without content. 'Tis safer to be that which we destroy. Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy. [woman screaming] What is that noise? It is the cry of women, my good lord. I have almost forgot the taste of fears. The time has been my senses would have cooled to hear a night-shriek. [laughs] And my fell of hair would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir as life were in it. I have supped full with horrors. Direness... Familiar to my slaughterous thoughts cannot once start me. Wherefore was that cry? The queen, my lord, is dead. She should have died hereafter. There would have been a time for such a word. Tomorrow. And tomorrow. And tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time. And all our yesterdays... Have lighted fools the way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow. A poor player... That struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot. Full of sound and fury. Signifying nothing. Thou comest to use thy tongue. Thy story quickly. Gracious my lord. I should report that which I say I saw. But know not how to do it. Well, say, sir. [messenger] As I did stand my watch upon the hill I looked toward Birnam. and anon methought the wood began to move. Liar and slave! Let me endure your wrath, if it be not so. Within this three mile may you see it coming. I say, a moving grove. If thou speak'st false, upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive till famine cling thee. If thy speech be sooth... I care not if thou dost for me as much. I pull in resolution and begin to doubt the equivocation of the fiend that lies like truth. 'Fear not, till Birnam wood do come to Dunsinane.' And now a wood comes toward Dunsinane. [shouting] Arm, arm, and out! If this which he avouches does appear... There is no flying hence nor tarrying here. I gin to be aweary of the sun. And wish the estate of the world were now undone. [shouting] Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! Come, wrack! At least we'll die with harness on our back. [triumphant music] [music continues] [music intensifies] [soldiers yell] [yelling intensifies] [battle sounds] [dramatic music] [battle sounds] They tied me to a stake I cannot fly. But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's he that was not born of woman? Such a one am I to fear, or none. [battle sounds continue] -What is thy name? -Thou'lt be afraid to hear it. No, that thou call'st thyself a hotter name than any in hell. My name's Macbeth. The devil himself could not pronounce a title more hateful to mine ear. No, nor more fearful. Thou liest, abhorred tyrant. With my sword I'll prove the lie thou speak'st. [Young Siward yells] [swords clashing] [yells] [gasps in pain] Thou wast born of woman. Swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn. Brandished by man that's of a woman born. That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face! If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine my wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still. I cannot strike at wretched kerns whose arms are hired to bear their staves. Either thou, Macbeth. Or else my sword with an unbattered edge I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be. By this great clatter, one of greatest note seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune! And more I beg not. [dramatic music] [soldiers shouting] Castle's gently rendered. The tyrant's people on both sides do fight. The noble thanes do bravely in the war. The day almost itself professes yours. And little is to do. We have met with foes that strike beside us. [Siward] Enter, sir, the castle [crows caw] [drums sounding] Why should I play the Roman fool and die on mine own sword? Whiles I see lives, the gashes do better upon them. Turn, hell-hound, turn! Of all men else have I avoided thee. But get thee back! My soul is charged enough with blood of thine already. [Macduff] I have no words. My voice is in my sword. Thou bloodier villain than terms can give thee out! [swords clashing] [moans of effort] Thou losest labor. As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air with thy keen sword impress as make me bleed. [swords slice through air] [moans with effort] Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests. I bear a charmed life. Which must not yield to one of woman born. [Macduff] Despair thy charm. And let the angel whom thou still hast served tell thee Macduff was from his mother's womb untimely ripped. Accursed be the tongue that tells me so. For it hath cow'd my better part of man! And be these juggling fiends no more believed. That palter with us in a double sense. That keep the word of promise from our ear. And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee. Then yield thee, coward. And live to be the gaze and show o' the time. We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are. Painted on a pole and underwrit. [growls] [Macbeth yells] 'Here may you see the tyrant.' I will not yield. To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet. And to be baited with the rabble's curse. Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane and thou opposed. Being of no woman born. Yet I will try the last. Before my body... I lay my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff. And damned be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!' [dramatic music] [swords clashing] [Macbeth yelling] [yells in pain] [music intensifies] [moans in pain] [shrieks in pain] [moaning continues] [Lady Macbeth voice over] Hie thee hither. [closing credits music]
